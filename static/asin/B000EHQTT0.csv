972909,A2582KMXLK2P06,B000EHQTT0,B. E Jackson,"[0, 0]","Mortuary is the kind of horror film that totally goes against what the description says- you'd think a family that moves into a haunted funeral home would lead way to some actual GHOSTS frequently haunting the place, but instead it's more about dead people waking up with blood pouring out of mysterious places in their body.  This eventually leads to blood pouring out of other people (characters in the storyline) in similar fashion as part of a curse.The writing is pretty darn weak because, as I mention above- instead of building a terrifying suspense and creating ghostly sights and sounds throughout the funeral home (which is what I was totally expecting to see given the title of the film) the movie goes for a cheap low budget storyline focusing less on the funeral home aspect and more on the one character (the older teenage boy) getting a job at a restaurant and encountering certain enemies (other teenagers) who give him a hard time.  It's not interesting at all, though.For some reason the writers gave most of the storylines attention to the teenage boys character and less on the actual suspense of the funeral home, making me feel VERY disappointed.My favorite scene is definitely the one where the mother turns into a monster with blood pouring out of her mouth while trying to fix a meal for her daughter, son, and the sons two friends.  A very good moment of actual horror/suspense here.Besides that, this film is quite dry in the suspense department, and there's no reason at all to be terrified of the funeral home since it's not spooky at *all*.

972911,A20IIR0422G3A5,B000EHQTT0,"B. Marold ""Bruce W. Marold""","[5, 7]","`Mortuary', directed by the acclaimed horror master, Tobe Hooper, and written by Jace Anderson and Adam Gierasch, seems to be pronounced dead at the scene. I have reviewed several horror movies lately by lesser-known directors such as `Saw II' and `Hostel' which showed a lot more originality and spark than this rather routine piece of filmmaking. Both these other movies exhibit a welcome modern trend in horror which relies on no supernatural agency, just as Hooper's classic `Texas Chain Saw Massacre' is so great because all the horror is done with no recourse to monsters, ghosts, goblins, witches, vampires, werewolves, green slimes, or even aliens from outer space! That is not to say that supernatural, alien, or paranormal effects can't be scary. `Alien', `The Exorcist', and `The Shining' are ample evidence of that; however, it is probably no accident that the scariest movie of all time (per American Film Institute list), `Jaws', involves not one wit of supernatural or extraterrestrial agency.The writers for this scarefest rely on at least two easy devices to enhance the scariness of their story. The first is the mortuary setting and the second is putting a young girl at risk. This second ploy has been done by even some of the greatest filmmakers such as James Cameron in `Aliens' and Stephen Spielberg in `Jurassic Park', where he goes even further and endangers two subteenaged children. But then, these are great movies by great directors, so they carry it off, even if it makes the viewers a bit queasy rather than just scared.The only thing for which I give the filmmakers credit is that they set the scene not in an artificially remote village or town, but in the heart of suburban California, just a few stones' throws off the freeway. Otherwise, the behavior of the characters just doesn't make a lot of sense in many places. The biggest problem seems to be that the characters commit the biggest gaff, of doing things that are patently stupid to the film's audience. It also does not really explain very well the origin and survival of the primary source of evil. While it seems to need constant feeding, there is no lore in the town about disappearances among the townsfolk. And, while the mortuary seems to provide a wealth of fresh bodies, the evil entity seems more interested in turning them into zombies than in turning them into lunch.The `making of' featurette goes so far as to liken the primary agent of evil with the character of `Boo' in `To Kill a Mockingbird'. I think this is really a stretch, as there is absolutely nothing sympathetic about this movie's primary mysterious human. The actors in this featurette praise director Hooper and are happy to be working with him, but I sense they know their project is not up to the level of `...Chainsaw...'Cheap thrills, but otherwise not very interesting.",3,"Discounted Hooper.

972912,A21VGNU5959O85,B000EHQTT0,CaterpillarGirl,"[1, 1]","This was an amusing movie, I expected it to be mediocre and it was. It didn't get a lot of press, but I love Tobe Hooper as a director so I thought I would give it a try. I am not going to go into the summary, because there are plenty of reviews on here with that, but I will say a couple of things that I found right and wrong in general. The casting was great, every single person fit their character especially La Peldon as a slutty teen from the outskirts of town. The effects, although many CGI were pretty good for a low budget, the makeup was very well done. The location for the movie, an old house which was supposed to be haunted according to the ""behind the scenes"" bit, was extremely creepy and was the perfect backdrop. The cemetery on the other hand in the front yard, to me, was too contrived and seemed really out of place, it had the prerequisite angel statue, a mausoleum, dead trees, broken crosses, everything but some dead hands sticking out of the earth and a crow or two. As for the story line, it flows with one or two hiccups here and there (the teacher buried in the cemetery, I thought no one had run the mortuary for years and years?) And I got really confused between the cop, and Bobby, I kept thinking one was the other because both were bald. My favorite part had to be when Courtney's Breast implants exploded when they threw rock salt on her, anytime that girl can get offed in a new way is fine by me. In closing this review, I would recommend it, its 99% better than most of the big budget ""horror"" films the studios are churning out like they were Brittney spears womb.",3,"""There might be a little mold problem""",1153958400,"07 27, 2006",2006,1606,"['was', 'amusing', 'movie', 'expected', 'be', 'mediocre', 'was', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'lot', 'press', 'love', 'Tobe', 'Hooper', 'director', 'thought', 'would', 'give', 'try', 'am', 'not', 'going', 'go', 'summary', 'are', 'plenty', 'reviews', 'here', 'will', 'say', 'couple', 'things', 'found', 'right', 'wrong', 'general', 'casting', 'was', 'great', 'single', 'person', 'fit', 'character', 'especially', 'La', 'Peldon', 'slutty', 'teen', 'outskirts', 'town', 'effects', 'many', 'CGI', 'were', 'pretty', 'good', 'low', 'budget', 'makeup', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'location', 'movie', 'old', 'house', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'haunted', 'according', 'scenes', 'bit', 'was', 'extremely', 'creepy', 'was', 'perfect', 'backdrop', 'cemetery', 'other', 'hand', 'front', 'yard', 'was', 'too', 'contrived', 'seemed', 'really', 'place', 'had', 'prerequisite', 'angel', 'statue', 'mausoleum', 'dead', 'trees', 'broken', 'crosses', 'everything', 'dead', 'hands', 'sticking', 'earth', 'crow', 'two', 'story', 'line', 'one', 'two', 'hiccups', 'here', 'there', 'teacher', 'buried', 'cemetery', 'thought', 'one', 'had', 'run', 'mortuary', 'years', 'years', 'got', 'really', 'confused', 'cop', 'Bobby', 'kept', 'thinking', 'one', 'was', 'other', 'were', 'bald', 'favorite', 'part', 'had', 'be', 'when', 'Courtney', 'Breast', 'implants', 'exploded', 'when', 'threw', 'rock', 'salt', 'girl', 'can', 'get', 'offed', 'new', 'way', 'fine', 'closing', 'review', 'would', 'recommend', '99', '%', 'better', 'most', 'big', 'budget', 'horror', 'studios', 'are', 'churning', 'out', 'were', 'Brittney', 'spears', 'womb']",N/A

With that said, I approached ""Mortuary"" with low expectations and was pleasantly surprised.

This film threw such an interesting twist on zombies, how can one not think its fun... a vine/mossy parasite that takes over your body, and although this is'nt a Hollywood release, there are some chilling effects. Also, the setting in the graveyard and funeral home created such an eerie atmosphere that added to the tone of the film.Although the plot got a tad cheesy toward the end, with the well of pure evil, and the strange undead sheriff, the end result was an extremely fun watch.

Then you see the ending and it just completely ruins everything? The film that I am currently reviewing just so happens to be one of them. I'm not sure who is to blame, it could be the guys who wrote the film. But then again it is the directors part to run the show. I love Tobe Hooper and I enjoyed the films that he's done in the past (how could you not) but it seems like his projects are getting worst with time. Well I actually did find the Toolbox Murders remake to be pretty cool. But Mortuary is another story and I can't talk about this film without thinking of how it ended. Mortuary tells the story of a family who begin a brand new life and move into a new house. They end up staying in an old funeral home where there is nothing close by except for graves and a mystery that goes along with the house itself. As the family gets settled, one of the main characters learns of a local legend about a man who isn't quite dead.I wasn't sure what to expect from this movie so by reading the actual plot I figured it would either be about ghosts or zombies. Surprisingly enough it isn't much of either. I could explain it more but I'm afraid that I would ruin it for those of you who haven't seen this film and plan to in the near future. Honestly I wouldn't recommend it anyway, I thought it was decent up until the last 15 minutes. What the film did feature was a good cast of actors which had really enjoyable character roles. What kept my attention through most of the film were the relationships between the characters. You get comfortable with the family and you get introduced to some rude and obnoxious teenagers who end up getting what they deserve later. That's all you should really expect, just watch it for what it promises. Watch it to see a bunch of kids getting killed by pissed off cemetery residents.What the film also features is a pretty good story. If you were to read the plot and view the pictures before seeing the movie you would figure it could run like a zombie film. The only thing about that is I really wouldn't call it a zombie film. Even though the last half of the movie sort of plays out like Night of the Creeps. It's not original but I thought it played out nicely for what it had story and character wise. Nothing big really happens until about 3/4 into the film where you start to see characters changing into these creatures with zombie like qualities. Infecting others around them with fluids that come straight from the mouth, and no that's not meant to be a sex joke. Mortuary has a familiar and good concept but the way it's played out isn't too impressive. The acting and most of the visual effects take away substance to what could have been some great segments in the movie. Not to mention it just gets silly after a while.As I mentioned earlier in my review the thing that really ruined it for me was the fact that things start to change and take a turn. When you finally meet the main villain in the movie you'd figure things would be hell from then on out. Sadly it runs the exact opposite and it doesn't feel right at all. It's painful to see that small unrewarding concept, especially if it's a horror film. Perhaps there was something I missed or just didn't understand, but I thought the last 15 minutes of the movie didn't fit well at all. Just when I thought that was bad the films ending is just horrible. It's safe for me to say that I was in a really bad mood when the movie finished. Watching Mortuary was just a waste of my time. The last scene in the film just ruins everything and it's a complete mess. Why build up such a story in the first place? After it was all over nothing seemed to make sense.",2,A waste of time,1146268800,"04 29, 2006",2006,3817,"['Have', 'ever', 'watched', 'movie', 'where', 'good', 'most', 'way', 'get', 'characters', 'enjoy', 'plot', 'even', 'nothing', 'new', 'Then', 'see', 'ending', 'just', 'completely', 'everything', 'film', 'am', 'currently', 'reviewing', 'just', 'so', 'be', 'one', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'who', 'blame', 'could', 'be', 'guys', 'who', 'wrote', 'film', 'then', 'again', 'directors', 'part', 'run', 'show', 'love', 'Tobe', 'Hooper', 'enjoyed', 'films', 'done', 'past', 'how', 'could', 'not', 'projects', 'are', 'getting', 'time', 'Well', 'actually', 'did', 'find', 'Toolbox', 'Murders', 'remake', 'be', 'pretty', 'cool', 'Mortuary', 'story', 'ca', ""n't"", 'talk', 'film', 'thinking', 'how', 'ended', 'Mortuary', 'story', 'family', 'who', 'begin', 'brand', 'new', 'life', 'move', 'new', 'house', 'end', 'up', 'staying', 'old', 'funeral', 'home', 'where', 'nothing', 'close', 'graves', 'mystery', 'along', 'house', 'family', 'settled', 'one', 'main', 'characters', 'learns', 'local', 'legend', 'man', 'who', ""n't"", 'quite', 'dead.I', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'what', 'expect', 'movie', 'so', 'reading', 'actual', 'plot', 'figured', 'would', 'either', 'be', 'ghosts', 'zombies', 'Surprisingly', ""n't"", 'much', 'could', 'explain', 'more', ""'m"", 'afraid', 'would', 'ruin', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'film', 'plan', 'near', 'future', 'Honestly', 'would', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'anyway', 'thought', 'was', 'decent', 'up', 'last', '15', 'minutes', 'What', 'film', 'did', 'feature', 'was', 'good', 'cast', 'actors', 'had', 'really', 'enjoyable', 'character', 'roles', 'What', 'kept', 'attention', 'most', 'film', 'were', 'relationships', 'characters', 'get', 'comfortable', 'family', 'get', 'introduced', 'rude', 'obnoxious', 'teenagers', 'who', 'end', 'up', 'getting', 'what', 'deserve', 'later', 'should', 'really', 'expect', 'just', 'watch', 'what', 'Watch', 'see', 'bunch', 'kids', 'getting', 'killed', 'pissed', 'off', 'cemetery', 'film', 'also', 'pretty', 'good', 'story', 'were', 'read', 'plot', 'view', 'pictures', 'seeing', 'movie', 'would', 'figure', 'could', 'run', 'zombie', 'film', 'only', 'thing', 'really', 'would', ""n't"", 'call', 'zombie', 'film', 'Even', 'last', 'half', 'movie', 'sort', 'plays', 'Night', 'Creeps', 'not', 'original', 'thought', 'played', 'out', 'nicely', 'what', 'had', 'story', 'character', 'wise', 'Nothing', 'big', 'really', '3/4', 'film', 'where', 'start', 'see', 'characters', 'changing', 'creatures', 'zombie', 'qualities', 'Infecting', 'others', 'fluids', 'come', 'straight', 'mouth', 'not', 'meant', 'be', 'sex', 'joke', 'Mortuary', 'familiar', 'good', 'concept', 'way', 'played', 'out', ""n't"", 'too', 'impressive', 'acting', 'most', 'visual', 'effects', 'take', 'away', 'substance', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'segments', 'movie', 'Not', 'mention', 'just', 'silly', 'while.As', 'mentioned', 'earlier', 'review', 'thing', 'really', 'ruined', 'was', 'fact', 'things', 'start', 'change', 'take', 'turn', 'When', 'finally', 'meet', 'main', 'villain', 'movie', ""'d"", 'figure', 'things', 'would', 'be', 'hell', 'then', 'out', 'Sadly', 'exact', 'opposite', ""n't"", 'feel', 'right', 'painful', 'see', 'small', 'unrewarding', 'concept', 'especially', 'horror', 'film', 'Perhaps', 'was', 'something', 'missed', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'understand', 'thought', 'last', '15', 'minutes', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'fit', 'well', 'Just', 'when', 'thought', 'was', 'bad', 'films', 'ending', 'just', 'horrible', 'safe', 'say', 'was', 'really', 'bad', 'mood', 'when', 'movie', 'finished', 'Watching', 'Mortuary', 'was', 'just', 'waste', 'time', 'last', 'scene', 'film', 'just', 'everything', 'complete', 'mess', 'Why', 'build', 'up', 'such', 'story', 'first', 'place', 'was', 'nothing', 'seemed', 'make', 'sense']",N/A

However, ""Mortuary"" is not one of them...to be perfectly frank, ""Mortuary"" is awful.  The acting is nothing short of horrendous.  Basically, this movie is about a mother who moves with her two children to a small town.  She becomes the local mortician, and buys this funeral home to not only conduct her business but live in as well...of course, the yard is nothing but a graveyard and a mortuary where something dark lives.  It's obvious that nobody in this movie has any brains, including this mother.  Well, there is this stuff (looks like mold), but it makes people into zombie-like creatures, and it gets all over the place...the next thing you know you got a bunch of zombies running around and not very convincingly I might add.  This movie is devoid of horror, and is not scary in the slightest.  I was very disappointed in this flick...what a poor effort by Mr. Hooper.  ""Mortuary"" is a complete and utter zero of a horror flick.P.S.

That led me to start the movie in a MST3K mood.  I'm pleased to say I was completely misled by this low-budget horror gem.After the family patriarch dies, single-mother with horrid haircut moves her children cross-country to a creepy, dilapidated house situated on a prime piece of real estate between a backed up sewer repository and a morgue.  Location, location, location.  The house comes complete with all the real estate essentials: 3 bedrooms, 2 baths, church organ, flickering kitchen lights, stairs that creek on every step, bad CGI, sink water that has equal parts hydrogen and feces.  You know, the standard stuff.  But it's all good because she's the new mortician.  But can she handle the strange occurrences at the graveyard?  Will the mystery of local legend/mutant Bobby Fowler be uncovered?Overall this is pretty good direct-to-DVD horror fare.  The cast performs admirably.  The female leads fulfill their primary role in horror: be hot.  None over or under act, which isn't normally par for the course in second rate horror.  The budget is clearly miniscule, so the CGI is acceptably subpar.  Well-executed gore is a suitable replacement anyway.  And the gore is plentiful.  Nasty, too.  Mix zombies together with Poltergeist and you've got a good idea about this movie.  Pretty good stuff if you ask me.  Even the score is a decent blend violin and piano reminiscent of early Friday the 13th aura.I'm not sure how I feel about the Goonies meets Star Wars meets Indiana Jones ending - trust me, not as good as it sounds - but the positive outweighs the negative and horror fans will be pleased.Jason Elin",4,"Graveyard Babies, Mouth-to-Mouth Gravy",1298332800,"02 22, 2011",2011,1751,"['chapter', 'list', 'Mortuary', 'following', 'Graveyard', 'Babies', 'Happy', 'Mortician', 'Disgruntled', 'Drivers', 'Hearty', 'Soup', 'led', 'start', 'movie', 'MST3K', 'mood', ""'m"", 'pleased', 'say', 'was', 'completely', 'misled', 'low-budget', 'horror', 'gem.After', 'family', 'patriarch', 'dies', 'single-mother', 'horrid', 'haircut', 'children', 'cross-country', 'creepy', 'dilapidated', 'house', 'situated', 'prime', 'piece', 'real', 'estate', 'backed', 'up', 'sewer', 'repository', 'morgue', 'Location', 'location', 'location', 'house', 'complete', 'real', 'estate', 'essentials', '3', 'bedrooms', '2', 'baths', 'church', 'organ', 'flickering', 'kitchen', 'lights', 'stairs', 'creek', 'step', 'bad', 'CGI', 'sink', 'water', 'equal', 'parts', 'hydrogen', 'feces', 'know', 'standard', 'stuff', 'good', 'new', 'mortician', 'can', 'handle', 'strange', 'occurrences', 'graveyard', 'Will', 'mystery', 'local', 'legend/mutant', 'Bobby', 'Fowler', 'be', 'uncovered', 'Overall', 'pretty', 'good', 'direct-to-DVD', 'horror', 'fare', 'cast', 'performs', 'admirably', 'female', 'leads', 'fulfill', 'primary', 'role', 'horror', 'be', 'hot', 'None', 'act', ""n't"", 'normally', 'par', 'course', 'second', 'rate', 'horror', 'budget', 'clearly', 'miniscule', 'CGI', 'acceptably', 'subpar', 'Well-executed', 'gore', 'suitable', 'replacement', 'anyway', 'gore', 'plentiful', 'Nasty', 'too', 'Mix', 'together', 'Poltergeist', ""'ve"", 'got', 'good', 'idea', 'movie', 'Pretty', 'good', 'stuff', 'ask', 'Even', 'score', 'decent', 'blend', 'violin', 'piano', 'reminiscent', 'early', 'Friday', '13th', 'aura.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'feel', 'Goonies', 'Star', 'Wars', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'ending', 'trust', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'positive', 'negative', 'horror', 'fans', 'will', 'be', 'pleased.Jason', 'Elin']",N/A

After countless other straight to video titles trying to cash in on the rescent ""zombie"" craze(Return Of The Living Dead 4, House Of The Dead 2, Day Of The Dead 2:Contagion to name just a few),I'd grown super weary of anything actually good coming to DVD.  I figured it was time to call it a day and consider myself lucky I got such greats as ""Shaun"", ""Land"", ""28"" & ""Undead"".  I got a promo copy of ""Mortuary"", and didn't think much of it.  Looking at the cast Star Trek TNG's Denise Crosby, and Salems Lot's Dan Byrd I didn't think much of it, then I caught the director's name, none other than ""Texas Chainsaw"" great TOBE HOOPER!!!  It was definately time to check this one out...Here's how the story goes...The Doyle family of 3(Mom, son & daughter) move to some small town in California to open a Mortuary.  There're some rumors about the Fowler Cemetary(next to the Mortuary)being haunted & some guy still lives in one of the crypts there....Blah, Blah, Blah...the dead start coming back to life...Yadda, Yadda, Yadda.  You get the picture, you get a pretty generic horror premise, but that doesn't really matter.  What does matter is the directing from Tobe, & the acting from the cast is great!!!  The beginning is a little slow, but it doesn't matter because you're actually interested in the characters.  Now the picture quality itself isn't so great(thats why I only gave it 4 stars), I'm pretty sure that's gotta be due to the amature studio ""Echo Bridge"" releasing the film though.  Anyway, if you want a FUN, & new look at a zombie movie, check this one out.  No this isn't a Romero movie, but it doesn't try to be one either though.

From ""Poltergeist"" to ""Salem's Lot"" to the recent ""Toolbox Murders,"" he's made his mark in spooky and gory flicks.  His gem, of course, is ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.""  It isn't very scary, but the chase is on from the instant the kids run into ol' Leatherface.This flick, ""Mortuary,"" is pretty much par for the course for Tobe Hooper.  It has plenty of gore, though much of that gets the CGI(i.e. fake-looking) treatment.  It also has Hooper's signature stamped firmly in the scenes involving the constant chasing and persistent peril of the main characters.Though Denise Crosby is the only actor in this flick that might be recognized by the general viewing audience, the cast is made up of mainly unknowns.  Those of you who remember know that Crosby was Tasha Yar on ""Star Trek:  The Next Generation.""  She, and the rest of the cast do an adequate job with what they're given.  In most of Hooper's flicks, however, all you really need to be able to do as an actor or actress is scream very loud, cry, run, and take a deathblow convincingly.The story centers around Crosby and her two children as they move into a new town to start their lives over.  She's a green mortician, and buys the local funeral home in a bland little town.  Business picks up pretty quick after a couple of highway accidents.  Then, local kids go missing and then reappear in a zombie-like state and spew blackish goo from their mouths.  All of this is blamed on a local legend who I won't spoil by naming right now.  Just know that he's ugly and was thought to be dead at one time.Crosby's son figures out what's going on in his new homestead and decides to fight the baddies before things get out of control.  Luckily for us, he's not too successful and we are given a visual feast of dead folks trying to catch our young hero and his friends.The film isn't deserving of more than three stars, and, to be honest, it only deserves a rental or two.

I guess he figures that he peaked too soon, that he's all out of chainsaw massacres and poltergeists, so he may as well just ride into retirement cranking out mindless, unentertaining crap. This lousy script was about a mother and her two kids that go to live in an abandoned mortuary so that the mom could embalm people while reading the instructions out of a book.

972938,A3PPXVR5J6U2JD,B000EHQTT0,"Michael J. Tresca ""Talien""","[0, 0]","If the director of Mortuary sounds familiar, it's because Tobe Hooper was the mastermind behind The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Given that pedigree, you might expect Morturary to be a scary movie worthy of the horror hall of fame.  And up until the last five minutes, it's actually a passable horror film.Mortuary has all the right horror elements: quotes from H.P. Lovecraft, evil mold, a funeral home, a creepy cemetery, and Tasha Yar (Denise Crosby) as the matriarch of a broken family. Jonathan (Dan Byrd), the teenage son, has the burden of responsibility as the ""man"" around the house and given his mother's poor skills as a professional embalmer (she reads from a book at one point), he has a lot of work to do.  Much of that work involves protecting his sister Jamie (Stephanie Patton).  This sad little family has uprooted itself for the last time in the hope of starting over.Problems arise as soon as they arrive at their new home.  Everybody in town is a caricature.  There's a cackling idiot welcoming them to a wrecked cesspool of a funeral home, so overridden with mold and filth that you can't imagine any sane mother would allow her children to stay there.  There are the one-dimensional teenagers who form a m&eacute;nage-a-trois of stupidity - the busty blonde doesn't change clothes throughout the week, the better to show her cleavage. Love interest Liz (attractive Alexandra Adi, 25 at the time the movie was released) looks far too old to be 14. There's the sassy diner waitress, the weird but stern sheriff, and the gay friend.  Whenever anyone commits a movie sin (premarital shenanigans, being a jerk, or being a gay friend) Hooper kills them off.What seems at first like a slasher flick or a ghost story is actually a fairly pedestrian zombie movie.  There are multiple culprits, including one Bobby Fowler (Price Carson) an abused mutant under the thrall of a black fungus that feeds on fresh blood.  Fowler may well have a spark of good in him, but that plot point is glossed over by choppy editing.  And near the end of the film, a zombie assault on the house transforms from a frenzied defense to a nonsensical series of cut scenes.You know that a movie's suffered at the hands of an editor when geographical details begin to fall apart.  The sheriff shows up looking for those meddling kids; but nobody notices when he disappears, leaving his police cruiser in front of the funeral home.  Bobby appears in Jamie's bedroom and leaves behind a mask, but no one ever thinks to check how he got there.  When they finally do check, it leads to the attic, which somehow magically leads to the graveyard across the street.Most of those inconsistencies are easy to gloss over.  The ending, however, is not.  Hooper seems to be getting jaded - perhaps he's dissatisfied with the state of the genre he helped create.  Whatever his reasoning, Hooper turns a standard zombie survival movie into a real downer by breaking all of his own rules.  Monsters come back to life, destroyed characters are resurrected, and the final attack is so abrupt that you can't help but wonder how stupid the monster really is if it could just swallow people up in one gulp all along. Of the three survivors, one isn't even given a conclusion.The worst thing about Mortuary is that it has just enough moments to make you care, which makes Hooper's slap-in-the-face ending sting all the more.

Mortuary is actually a great bit of horror fun for a good chunk of it's writing time, that is before it succumbs to the formulatic slasher/chase sequences.  The film starts out with a widowed mother (Pet Semetery's Denise Crosby), her teenage son (Dan Byrd of the Hills Have Eyes remake) and young daughter moving into a decrepit mortuary, in hopes of making a new career and life for herself.  However, as these films go, this house has a secret, and soon enough we've got the bile spewing undead on the loose!  Loaded with CGI gore effects (some good, most are, well, CGI looking) and some humerously goofy moments (including Crosby's meddling of embalming a corpse) to boot, Mortuary ultimately suffers from some poor acting, leaps in logic, and plot holes aplenty.  Despite those negatives, Mortuary is still a good bit of fun from one of the most legendary names in the genre, and the grim denouement even makes it all the more worth seeing for horror buffs.",3,A nice bit of fun for a while,1168128000,"01 7, 2007",2007,1199,"['When', 'Tobe', 'Hooper', 'who', 'crafted', 'classics', 'original', 'Texas', 'Chainsaw', 'Massacre', 'Poltergeist', 'Salem', 'Lot', 'more', 'recent', 'works', 'especially', 'Showtime', 'Masters', 'Horror', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'much', 'write', 'home', 'Mortuary', 'actually', 'great', 'bit', 'horror', 'fun', 'good', 'chunk', 'writing', 'time', 'formulatic', 'slasher/chase', 'sequences', 'film', 'out', 'widowed', 'mother', 'Pet', 'Semetery', 'Denise', 'Crosby', 'teenage', 'son', 'Dan', 'Byrd', 'Hills', 'Have', 'Eyes', 'remake', 'young', 'daughter', 'moving', 'decrepit', 'mortuary', 'hopes', 'making', 'new', 'career', 'life', 'herself', 'However', 'films', 'go', 'house', 'secret', 'soon', 'enough', ""'ve"", 'got', 'bile', 'spewing', 'undead', 'loose', 'Loaded', 'CGI', 'gore', 'effects', 'good', 'most', 'are', 'well', 'CGI', 'looking', 'humerously', 'goofy', 'moments', 'including', 'Crosby', 'meddling', 'embalming', 'corpse', 'boot', 'Mortuary', 'ultimately', 'poor', 'acting', 'leaps', 'logic', 'plot', 'holes', 'aplenty', 'negatives', 'Mortuary', 'still', 'good', 'bit', 'fun', 'one', 'most', 'legendary', 'names', 'genre', 'grim', 'denouement', 'even', 'more', 'worth', 'seeing', 'horror', 'buffs']",N/A
972943,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B000EHQTT0,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[0, 0]","Mortuary (Tobe Hooper, 2006)I've seen a lot of horror movies over the past few years that could have been great and ended up being bad. Movies for which I allowed myself to have high expectations that, almost to a one, were dashed (or, in the case of Hostel, dented a little). So finding Mortuary, which revels in its awfulness, a refreshing change of pace was not as surprising, perhaps, as my initial reaction to my finding it such was.Yes, I will state again for the record-- Mortuary blows goat. Hooper hasn't made a good big-screen film (yes, this movie did play on the big screen-- a single showing, as far as I can find out, in California) since Poltergeist all the way back in 1982, and he extends his record here. But somewhere along the way, Hooper came to terms with the fact that his movies often come out looking more like plates of spaghetti than movies, and has adjusted. As a result, we get stuff like this.Leslie Doyle (Tasha-- erm, Denise Crosby) and her children, Jonathan (The Hills Have Eyes' Dan Byrd) and Jamie (Baby Geniuses' Stephanie Patton), move to a little town in the middle of nowhere so Denise can become a mortician. She leased the mortuary sight unseen, and when Eliot (veteran character actor Greg Travis), the real estate agent and by far the creepiest character in the film, shows them in, they realized they've been had. Still, Denise is ready to make the best of a bad thing. Jonathan, trying to avoid becoming his mother's assistant (a job his younger sister, mind you, craves), goes into town and gets a job at the local diner, meeting the gorgeous Liz (Alexandra Adi of Slap Her...She's French fame) and the irrepressible Grady (Shallow Ground's Rocky Marquette) in the process. Yep, that about covers the bases for your basic horror film, with the exception of the town bully and the local bumbling cop. Oh, wait, that's Cal (character actor Bug Hall) and Sheriff Howell (recurring X-Files actor Michael Shamus Wiles), respectively.The difference between this and, say, the recent remake of The Hills Have Eyes-- an obvious comparison, with Dan Byrd having a leading role in both-- is that where The Hills Have Eyes wanted you to take it seriously, Mortuary doesn't give a damn. It's not a movie that wants to do anything but entertain you. It's not trying to fill any big sets of shoes, like the rash of remakes, to a one, are failing to do. It's just there, like so many of the great cult horror films of the last thirty years-- Return of the Living Dead, C. H. U. D., Night of the Creeps. Don't get me wrong, Mortuary can't hold a candle to any of those where pure, all-out quality of filmmaking is concerned. But I can pretty much guarantee you that, when the remakes have all faded into well-deserved obscurity, little independent television channels, assuming any still exist, will still be showing Mortuary at three in the morning. ** ?",3,"Tobe Hooper's not-so-great, but loads of fun, return.",1145577600,"04 21, 2006",2006,2886,"['Mortuary', 'Tobe', 'Hooper', '2006', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'lot', 'horror', 'movies', 'past', 'few', 'years', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'bad', 'Movies', 'allowed', 'have', 'high', 'expectations', 'almost', 'one', 'were', 'dashed', 'case', 'Hostel', 'dented', 'little', 'So', 'finding', 'Mortuary', 'awfulness', 'refreshing', 'change', 'pace', 'was', 'not', 'surprising', 'perhaps', 'initial', 'reaction', 'finding', 'such', 'was.Yes', 'will', 'state', 'again', 'record', 'Mortuary', 'blows', 'goat', 'Hooper', ""n't"", 'made', 'good', 'big-screen', 'film', 'yes', 'movie', 'did', 'play', 'big', 'screen', 'single', 'showing', 'as', 'far', 'can', 'find', 'out', 'California', 'Poltergeist', 'way', 'back', '1982', 'record', 'here', 'somewhere', 'way', 'Hooper', 'came', 'terms', 'fact', 'movies', 'often', 'come', 'out', 'looking', 'more', 'plates', 'spaghetti', 'movies', 'adjusted', 'result', 'get', 'stuff', 'this.Leslie', 'Doyle', 'Tasha', 'erm', 'Denise', 'Crosby', 'children', 'Jonathan', 'Hills', 'Have', 'Eyes', 'Dan', 'Byrd', 'Jamie', 'Baby', 'Geniuses', 'Stephanie', 'Patton', 'move', 'little', 'town', 'middle', 'nowhere', 'so', 'Denise', 'can', 'become', 'mortician', 'leased', 'mortuary', 'sight', 'unseen', 'when', 'Eliot', 'veteran', 'character', 'actor', 'Greg', 'Travis', 'real', 'estate', 'agent', 'far', 'creepiest', 'character', 'film', 'realized', ""'ve"", 'been', 'had', 'Still', 'Denise', 'ready', 'make', 'best', 'bad', 'thing', 'Jonathan', 'trying', 'avoid', 'becoming', 'mother', 'assistant', 'job', 'younger', 'sister', 'mind', 'craves', 'town', 'job', 'local', 'diner', 'meeting', 'gorgeous', 'Liz', 'Alexandra', 'Adi', 'Slap', 'Her', 'French', 'fame', 'irrepressible', 'Grady', 'Shallow', 'Ground', 'Rocky', 'Marquette', 'process', 'Yep', 'covers', 'bases', 'basic', 'horror', 'film', 'exception', 'town', 'bully', 'local', 'bumbling', 'cop', 'Oh', 'wait', 'Cal', 'character', 'actor', 'Bug', 'Hall', 'Sheriff', 'Howell', 'recurring', 'X-Files', 'actor', 'Michael', 'Shamus', 'Wiles', 'respectively.The', 'difference', 'say', 'recent', 'remake', 'Hills', 'Have', 'Eyes', 'obvious', 'comparison', 'Dan', 'Byrd', 'having', 'leading', 'role', 'where', 'Hills', 'Have', 'Eyes', 'wanted', 'take', 'seriously', 'Mortuary', ""n't"", 'give', 'damn', 'not', 'movie', 'do', 'anything', 'entertain', 'not', 'trying', 'fill', 'big', 'sets', 'shoes', 'rash', 'remakes', 'one', 'are', 'failing', 'do', 'just', 'there', 'so', 'many', 'great', 'cult', 'horror', 'films', 'last', 'thirty', 'years', 'Return', 'Living', 'Dead', 'C.', 'H.', 'U.', 'D.', 'Night', 'Creeps', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'Mortuary', 'ca', ""n't"", 'hold', 'candle', 'where', 'pure', 'all-out', 'quality', 'filmmaking', 'concerned', 'can', 'pretty', 'much', 'guarantee', 'when', 'remakes', 'have', 'faded', 'well-deserved', 'obscurity', 'little', 'independent', 'television', 'channels', 'assuming', 'still', 'exist', 'will', 'still', 'be', 'showing', 'Mortuary', 'three', 'morning', '**']",N/A

972946,A3UA046AA3DXFD,B000EHQTT0,Sid the Elf,"[1, 1]","Hello B fans, this is us, Sid the Elf, how are you? It's a doube dip this week. We tackled Steven Segal inPistol Whippedearly in the week which naturally took a few days to recover from as the man is north of 400 lbs. Now we're back to review Mortuary. This film was directed by Tobe Hooper of Texas Chainsaw Massacre fame, which was probably the only reason it ever made a theatrical release. This one smacked of straight to dvd. Those of you who know Sid's reviews know that this is not a problem. In fact, there was a lot to like about Mortuary. We felt like the film had all the elements of being a certified 5 star B, but fell short.The plot of the film revolves around the Doyle family which includes Mom(Leslie) and her two kids, Jonathan and Jamie. The mother, in her infinite wisdom decides to become a mortitian. Of course! Isn't that the job of choice for every single mother with an 8 year old girl? So, Mom buys a completely dilapidated house in California. This place could be a real beauty though, with the embalming room for a basement and a graveyard in front. Sounds like a dream right? How could these people not know there was going to be trouble? Then Jonathan gets a job at the local diner where he learns the story of Bobby Fowler, who used to live in Jonathan's new house and some say still does. In a nutshell, Bobby was the great grandson of Zeb Fowler, who started the mortuary. Bobby was a disfigured freak when he was born so his parents covered his face with a burial shroud and locked him in his room with bars on his windows and everything. Good times all around. Legend has it that Bobby killed his parents and still lives in his old house. Before we move on, let's get something out of the way: Mortuary had two HUGE parallels to The Final Sacrifice, the trancendant Mystery Science Theatre 3000 movie. By the way, look for a review of The Final Sacrifice from Sid as part of MST 3000 season 9 in a few weeks. First, the Zeb Fowler character. That sounds an awful lot like...""Hey kid, I'm Rowsdower, Zap Rowsdower."" And, if you don't think Jonathan doesn't strike an eerie resembelance to the legendary Troy McGreggor, Sid doesn't know what to tell you.At this point we're about 40 minutes into the movie and it finally starts to get really cool. That's Sid's problem with the film, they concentrated way too much on the family setteling into the new house and blah blah blah. The only thing this accomplished was you got attached to the little girl, Jamie. This is essential in a horror movie, to have someone you absolutely do not want to be harmed. She was it, anyone else would have been fine. Not her, not her. Anyway, here you have the awesome scene where the townies(1 goofy guy and 2 smoking hot chicks) go into a crypt to have a quasi-threesome. Great scene because it was totally unexpected. So, they get attacked by this wierd vine-like stuff and it turns them into zombies. Meanwhile, Mom is embalming a corpse, and she gets attacked by it and also turns into a zombie. Yep, a real zombie movie. Pretty cool idea to revive the concept. So now the zombies are after Jonathan and his friends, one of whom gets a zombie hand through the chest. Sweet.Now, the crew is trying to get away from the zombies, including the mom. They eventually hit the epicenter of the evil activity that has been plauging the house for centuries. It's like a well filled with evil. The zombies are trying to feed Jamie to it. Not cool. They have to find a way to prevent this. They finally do. You ready for what the solution was? Rock salt. Yeah, just pour rock salt into the well of pure evil. That should do it. But, whatever, you knew they were going to get away. So, they're walking away, finally through with the ordeal. Jonathan is skipping along merrily doing his Troy ""Rowsdower!"" routine. And the groung opens up and something grabbs him! And that's it, the movie ends.Was this to leave the door open for a sequel, or to just give it a cool ending? Sid hopes it's option B. This movie was definitely decent. It even had one or two scary moments. Like when the bodies attacked Mom, that was nice. If it's Sid, he's saying the flick is worth checking out if you're an avid horror fan. However, it wasn't good enough to make a sequel. All in all, a tough movie to rate. Sid says when in doubt, 3 hot chicks in the movie = 3 stars.",3,"What were you expecting, honey?

A lot of the acting in texas chainsaw massacre wasn't really all that great. the thing about tobe hoopers movies that I have always loved is the atmosphere that he creates. like in his movie salems lot. the scene where the boy appears at the window. everything leading up to that was pretty dang eerie and that is what tobe hooper is good at.his last film 'toolbox murders' was really good. i thought it was a step above the original. it made me think tobe hooper was back. i started to imagine going to see his movies in the theatre. i thought mortuary was going to be in theatres and then one day i was in walmart and saw it on the shelf. i grabbed it and couldn't wait to get home just to watch it. the first half of the film is pretty good. the second hand feels rushed and i lost interest in the film, the story, i couldn't care less about the characters. what happened is something i can only speculate. i was able to overlook the special effects because i watch the sci fi channel religiously and there effects can get pretty bad. somewhere a long the lines the writers ran out of ideas, lost there focus, i imagine on paper this looked pretty good. that is the only way i could see tobe hooper wanting to do this film.i give this movie three stars because i believe that somewhere along the lines tobe hooper must have known this movie wouldn't turn out all that great and he still finished it.",2,it felt like tobe hooper didn't direct the whole thing,1150416000,"06 16, 2006",2006,1735,"['lot', 'people', 'have', 'stated', 'did', ""n't"", 'movie', 'bad', 'special', 'effects', 'lot', 'thought', 'ending', 'was', 'horrible', 'guess', 'can', 'agree', 'CGI', 'was', 'pretty', 'bad', 'ending', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'too', 'much', 'sense', 'movie', 'had', 'lot', 'flaws', 'acting', 'was', ""n't"", 'that', 'good', 'complaints', 'though', 'lot', 'acting', 'texas', 'chainsaw', 'massacre', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'all', 'great', 'thing', 'tobe', 'hoopers', 'movies', 'have', 'always', 'loved', 'atmosphere', 'movie', 'lot', 'scene', 'where', 'boy', 'window', 'everything', 'leading', 'up', 'was', 'pretty', 'dang', 'eerie', 'what', 'tobe', 'hooper', 'good', 'at.his', 'last', 'film', 'murders', 'was', 'really', 'good', 'i', 'thought', 'was', 'step', 'original', 'made', 'think', 'hooper', 'was', 'back', 'i', 'started', 'imagine', 'going', 'see', 'movies', 'theatre', 'i', 'thought', 'mortuary', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'theatres', 'then', 'one', 'day', 'i', 'was', 'walmart', 'saw', 'shelf', 'i', 'grabbed', 'could', ""n't"", 'wait', 'get', 'home', 'just', 'watch', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'pretty', 'good', 'second', 'hand', 'feels', 'rushed', 'i', 'lost', 'interest', 'film', 'story', 'i', 'could', ""n't"", 'care', 'less', 'characters', 'what', 'happened', 'something', 'i', 'can', 'only', 'speculate', 'i', 'was', 'able', 'overlook', 'special', 'effects', 'i', 'watch', 'sci', 'fi', 'channel', 'religiously', 'there', 'effects', 'can', 'get', 'pretty', 'bad', 'somewhere', 'long', 'lines', 'writers', 'ran', 'ideas', 'lost', 'focus', 'i', 'imagine', 'paper', 'looked', 'pretty', 'good', 'only', 'way', 'i', 'could', 'see', 'tobe', 'hooper', 'wanting', 'do', 'film.i', 'give', 'movie', 'three', 'stars', 'i', 'believe', 'somewhere', 'lines', 'tobe', 'hooper', 'must', 'have', 'known', 'movie', 'would', ""n't"", 'turn', 'out', 'great', 'still', 'finished']",N/A
972948,A2CT2SA6KFE8GC,B000EHQTT0,"Stanley Runk ""Runkdapunk""","[8, 10]","I've always loved Tobe Hooper, and I've stuck with him through highs and lows.  The guy's a schlock B movie director and actually seems proud of that fact.  He never seemed to have aspirations like Raimi and Jackson of hitting the big time, he seems happy doing what he does.  I think Tobe got screwed somewhat though.  When your first film is the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, you've set the bar pretty high, and everyone's gonna expect all of your films from there on out to be just as good if not better than that.  Hooper's had to live with this curse for years.  Hell, you ever seen a coverbox for a Hooper film that didn't say, ""From the director of Texas Chainsaw Massacre""?  It's got be tough considering all his films since then have been B exploitation flicks.  Chainsaw was too, but people and critics seemed to only accept it one time around.  Sure, he did hit the big time with Poltergeist, but I don't really count that coz that has Speilberg written all over it.  The film would have been totally different if only Hooper had done it.  Many schlocky films later we arrive at Mortuary.  The problem with Mortuary isn't that it's a bad film coz it isn't, but because it's too much a product of the times.  What I mean by that is that we live in a time when there are about eight billion direct to video horror films on the video store shelves.  At least two seem to come out each week.  Back in Hooper's heyday this wasn't so.  Basically I'm saying that if Hooper's name wasn't on this film, you wouldn't be able to tell the difference between this film and one of those countless others on the shelf.  Sad, but true.  Hooper seems to have gotten lost in an enormous pile of movies influenced by his own.  It also seems as if Hooper has been forever banished to the direct to video arena.  The last theatrical release we saw from him was The Mangler over ten years ago.  Theatrical space now is reserved for really high quality entertainment like XXX: State Of Union and Phat Girlz.  If Mortuary had been released in the 80s, it would definitely have some staying power, but I'm afraid it'll get lost in the shuffle within a year or so.  Like I said, Mortuary isn't a bad film(it is if you get off on Citizen Kane or Bringing Down The House), in fact I might just purchase it coz I like Hooper and would like to own all of his films.  The idea of the film is an interesting one.  It's like a mix of Lovecraft's Colour Out Of Space(the green viney stuff making the soil bad, not to mention the creature in the well which is pretty Lovecraftian), Carpenter's Prince Of Darkness(the contagium spread by puking into mouths), and of course Night Of The Living Dead.  It's got a bunch of Hooper's trademark oddball characters, most amusing being a stuttering sheriff and comedian Greg Travis as a sleazy city official who is constantly laughing.  Mortuary isn't a big comeback film for Hooper.  It might even disappoint many of his fans, but Tobe's still going full speed ahead after all these years.  At least the B horror world will always have Tobe.",3,Graveyard Babies(All Got Rabies),1145232000,"04 17, 2006",2006,3054,"[""'ve"", 'always', 'loved', 'Tobe', 'Hooper', ""'ve"", 'stuck', 'highs', 'lows', 'guy', 'schlock', 'B', 'movie', 'director', 'actually', 'proud', 'fact', 'never', 'seemed', 'have', 'aspirations', 'Raimi', 'Jackson', 'hitting', 'big', 'time', 'happy', 'doing', 'what', 'think', 'Tobe', 'got', 'screwed', 'somewhat', 'When', 'first', 'film', 'Texas', 'Chainsaw', 'Massacre', ""'ve"", 'set', 'bar', 'pretty', 'high', 'everyone', 'gon', 'expect', 'films', 'there', 'out', 'be', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'not', 'better', 'Hooper', 'had', 'live', 'curse', 'years', 'Hell', 'ever', 'seen', 'coverbox', 'Hooper', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'say', 'director', 'Texas', 'Chainsaw', 'Massacre', 'got', 'be', 'tough', 'considering', 'films', 'then', 'have', 'been', 'B', 'exploitation', 'flicks', 'Chainsaw', 'was', 'too', 'people', 'critics', 'seemed', 'only', 'accept', 'one', 'time', 'Sure', 'did', 'hit', 'big', 'time', 'Poltergeist', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'count', 'coz', 'Speilberg', 'written', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'totally', 'different', 'only', 'Hooper', 'had', 'done', 'Many', 'schlocky', 'films', 'later', 'arrive', 'Mortuary', 'problem', 'Mortuary', ""n't"", 'bad', 'film', 'coz', ""n't"", 'too', 'much', 'product', 'times', 'What', 'mean', 'live', 'time', 'when', 'are', 'eight', 'billion', 'direct', 'video', 'horror', 'films', 'video', 'store', 'shelves', 'least', 'two', 'seem', 'come', 'out', 'week', 'Back', 'Hooper', 'heyday', 'was', ""n't"", 'so', 'Basically', ""'m"", 'saying', 'Hooper', 'name', 'was', ""n't"", 'film', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'able', 'tell', 'difference', 'film', 'one', 'countless', 'others', 'shelf', 'Sad', 'true', 'Hooper', 'have', 'gotten', 'lost', 'enormous', 'pile', 'movies', 'influenced', 'own', 'also', 'Hooper', 'been', 'forever', 'banished', 'direct', 'video', 'arena', 'last', 'theatrical', 'release', 'saw', 'was', 'Mangler', 'ten', 'years', 'ago', 'Theatrical', 'space', 'now', 'reserved', 'really', 'high', 'quality', 'entertainment', 'XXX', 'State', 'Union', 'Phat', 'Girlz', 'Mortuary', 'had', 'been', 'released', '80s', 'would', 'definitely', 'have', 'staying', 'power', ""'m"", 'afraid', ""'ll"", 'get', 'lost', 'shuffle', 'year', 'so', 'said', 'Mortuary', ""n't"", 'bad', 'film', 'get', 'off', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'Bringing', 'Down', 'House', 'fact', 'might', 'just', 'purchase', 'coz', 'Hooper', 'would', 'like', 'own', 'films', 'idea', 'film', 'interesting', 'one', 'mix', 'Lovecraft', 'Colour', 'Out', 'Space', 'green', 'viney', 'stuff', 'making', 'soil', 'bad', 'not', 'mention', 'creature', 'well', 'pretty', 'Lovecraftian', 'Carpenter', 'Prince', 'Darkness', 'contagium', 'spread', 'puking', 'mouths', 'course', 'Night', 'Living', 'Dead', 'got', 'bunch', 'Hooper', 'trademark', 'oddball', 'characters', 'most', 'amusing', 'being', 'stuttering', 'sheriff', 'comedian', 'Greg', 'Travis', 'sleazy', 'city', 'official', 'who', 'constantly', 'laughing', 'Mortuary', ""n't"", 'big', 'comeback', 'film', 'Hooper', 'might', 'even', 'disappoint', 'many', 'fans', 'Tobe', 'still', 'going', 'full', 'speed', 'ahead', 'years', 'least', 'B', 'horror', 'world', 'will', 'always', 'have', 'Tobe']",N/A
