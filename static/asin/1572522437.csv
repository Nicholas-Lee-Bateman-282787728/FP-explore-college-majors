As in the others, the plot revolves around a married man who has convinced himself, through his own rationalized thinking, that he is happy and content with his life - yet is on the brink of having an affair, which at the last moment refuses he to go through with. There's lots of talk, as in all Rohmer movies, but it's always interesting.It's fascinating to see this man (Bernard Verley) go through the agonies of his conscience vs. his feelings. And Chloe (Zouzou) is equally fascinating as the sexy seductress. Verley's contradictions, usually of fairly minor concern (for example, at the beginning of the movie he thinks to himself how much he loves the solitude of his afternoons, and then at the end he tells his wife he hates them), always come as a disconcerting shock - and are perfectly timed. Rohmer pays very close attention to the little details which in retrospect add up to quite a bit.

Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric, a successful businessman, likes to work during lunch hours and to walk in the streets of Paris in the afternoon in order  to admire the beautiful lonely girls. He reads Captain Cook's travel books  and daydreams a lot. He lives the &quot;bourgeois&quot; life by  excellence.Then come Chloe and Temptation.

Superb idea !In CHLOE IN THE AFTERNOON,  Rohmer's actors sound more professional than in the french director's other  movies. But it's just an impression because if you take a look at the  filmography of most of these actors, you scarcely will find other movie  credits. It surely takes a while to get rid of the impression that these  actors don't play well ; they are amateurs (at least, I think so !) playing  according to Eric Rohmer's notion of Reality.

186786,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,1572522437,Dennis Littrell,"[16, 17]","Veteran French actor Bernard Verley stars as Frederic who is the kind of man who loves women with a great passion, but finds that he can direct all that love physically into one woman.  Chloe is a woman, cynical about men, confident of her power of seduction, a woman who never wants to marry.  They were friends and now they meet again.  He is married, a successful businessman.  She is single, living from day to day.  What will happen?  Will she entice him away from his wife?  Will he find the French happiness with a wife and a mistress?The title, while good, is misleading, as is the sexy cover on this video. (The French title,  L'amour l'apres-midi, is better; but that title in English was taken by Love in the Afternoon (1957) starring Gary Cooper and Audrey Hepburn.)  This is about as sexy as a Disney movie (although there is some backside nudity), yet it is an intriguing story about love, human sexuality and the question of monogamy.  I can already see some of the other reviews: &quot;Too talky.&quot;  &quot;Endless talk and no action.&quot;  Ah, but they are wrong.  This is a fascinating film in which the action is subtle and true and very interesting.Francoise Verley plays Frederic's wife.  She is not nearly as pretty as he thinks she is.  Nor is she as removed from his life away from her as he naively believes.  Eric Rohmer's subtle direction makes it clear that she knows more than she will ever tell him, that she loves him and perhaps prays that he still loves her.  But she is above saying a single word.  One gets the sense that she knows he is a man so attractive to other women that it is inevitable that he will stray.  But does he?  The final scene in which we know why she is crying--although ironically, he does not--is just beautifully done and ends the movie at exactly the right moment.Zouzou plays Chloe who is Parisian, bohemian and quietly desperate.  As usual with Rohmer there is a kind of realism in the movie that defies description.  The people and the scenes and the events are real; there is no straining for effect, and everything is understated with a characteristic Rohmerian message about human nature.This starts slow and never really speeds up, but do yourself a favor and stay with it.  The denouement is beautifully turned and the revelation of the three principal characters is as clear and clean and agreeable as Chloe after her shower.",4,Intriguing story about love and monogamy,997142400,"08 7, 2001",2001,2397,"['Veteran', 'French', 'actor', 'Bernard', 'Verley', 'stars', 'Frederic', 'who', 'kind', 'man', 'who', 'women', 'great', 'passion', 'can', 'direct', 'love', 'physically', 'one', 'woman', 'Chloe', 'woman', 'cynical', 'men', 'confident', 'power', 'seduction', 'woman', 'who', 'never', 'marry', 'were', 'friends', 'now', 'meet', 'again', 'married', 'successful', 'businessman', 'single', 'living', 'day', 'day', 'What', 'will', 'happen', 'Will', 'entice', 'away', 'wife', 'Will', 'find', 'French', 'happiness', 'wife', 'mistress', 'title', 'good', 'misleading', 'sexy', 'cover', 'video', 'French', 'title', ""L'amour"", ""l'apres-midi"", 'better', 'title', 'English', 'was', 'taken', 'Love', 'Afternoon', '1957', 'starring', 'Gary', 'Cooper', 'Audrey', 'Hepburn', 'about', 'as', 'sexy', 'Disney', 'movie', 'backside', 'nudity', 'intriguing', 'story', 'love', 'human', 'sexuality', 'question', 'monogamy', 'can', 'already', 'see', 'other', 'reviews', 'quot', 'Too', 'talky.', 'quot', 'quot', 'Endless', 'talk', 'action.', 'quot', 'Ah', 'are', 'wrong', 'fascinating', 'film', 'action', 'subtle', 'true', 'very', 'interesting.Francoise', 'Verley', 'Frederic', 'wife', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'pretty', 'removed', 'life', 'away', 'naively', 'Eric', 'Rohmer', 'subtle', 'direction', 'clear', 'more', 'will', 'ever', 'tell', 'perhaps', 'prays', 'still', 'saying', 'single', 'word', 'One', 'sense', 'man', 'so', 'attractive', 'other', 'women', 'inevitable', 'will', 'stray', 'final', 'scene', 'know', 'why', 'crying', 'ironically', 'not', 'just', 'beautifully', 'done', 'movie', 'exactly', 'right', 'moment.Zouzou', 'plays', 'Chloe', 'who', 'Parisian', 'bohemian', 'quietly', 'desperate', 'usual', 'Rohmer', 'kind', 'realism', 'movie', 'description', 'people', 'scenes', 'events', 'are', 'real', 'straining', 'effect', 'everything', 'understated', 'characteristic', 'Rohmerian', 'message', 'human', 'nature.This', 'slow', 'never', 'really', 'up', 'do', 'favor', 'stay', 'denouement', 'beautifully', 'turned', 'revelation', 'three', 'principal', 'characters', 'clear', 'clean', 'agreeable', 'Chloe', 'shower']",N/A

It's like he's trying to imply a movie instead of making one.  Everything looks frayed, but it goes deeper than mere understatement: nobody in the movie has a spine and it's as if they're being held upward by strings.  The movie has such a soft mushy feel to it that the erotic scenes don't feel erotic.  It's like he's trying to take away all the fun, but wants to tease us at the same time.  And that's okay in itself -- Bergman's Persona is the ultimate tease -- but here you're not sure who is in control, and the experience just becomes tedious.",2,Chloe in the Afternoon,983318400,"02 28, 2001",2001,638,"['lackluster', 'direction', 'Rohmer', ""n't"", 'match', 'intensity', 'themes', 'involved', 'trying', 'imply', 'movie', 'instead', 'making', 'one', 'Everything', 'frayed', 'deeper', 'mere', 'understatement', 'nobody', 'movie', 'spine', ""'re"", 'being', 'held', 'upward', 'strings', 'movie', 'soft', 'mushy', 'feel', 'erotic', 'scenes', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'erotic', 'trying', 'take', 'away', 'fun', 'tease', 'same', 'time', 'okay', 'Bergman', 'Persona', 'ultimate', 'tease', 'here', ""'re"", 'not', 'sure', 'who', 'control', 'experience', 'just', 'becomes', 'tedious']",N/A
186788,A9HKBYQB4XIEV,1572522437,"""eurotrashgirl""","[10, 12]","An interesting take on infidelity. Rohmer's style is subtle and sparse, and his characters take first priority. The protagonist is a happily married man who still fantasizes about every pretty girl he sees while walking on the streets of Paris. A friend he hasn't seen for a while and wasn't particularly close to before, Chloe, drifts back into his life and thoughts, slowly but surely. Her affections for him seem to grow as they begin to spend generally platonic afternoons together, while at the same time his beautiful wife, who he truly adores, has their first child. The new father then continues his friendship with the young Chloe, and he ultimately must make the decision whether to cross that line with her.Although there are two women to the one man in this story, as in the other Rohmer films I've seen, this film is about the Man, and His Choice. The Male protagonist speaks to us in the voice over, it is His Story. His thoughts, His dreams, His fantasies, and His choice.One complaint, if it can be called that, is that the wife's character leaves less of a trace than Chloe. One would like to know why the protagonist makes the decision he must make in the end, and be able to compare the two women he shares his days with somehow. The main difference between his wife and Chloe seems to be that his wife is more submissive and less playful, almost melancholy in a way (but not necessarily unhappy). And fragile as a bird. As would be expected, she represents stability, continuity, home. Chloe on the other hand is a bohemian drifter type who appears and disappears just as easily. She represents, also as to be expected, freedom, spontaneity, possibility. But they are still, in some sense, fragments. Especially the wife. We do see her joy in motherhood and domesticity, but it's only in one dimension.Rohmer's films are like a giant puzzle with One Proper Couple being formed as all the pieces come together. He is fascinated with the beginning/early stages of relationships, and the choices that are made at that point. Serving as a sort of match-maker for his characters, he foresees one suitable mate for his Protagonist, and Only One. And though these films are watchable and interesting, sometimes he leaves the information/emotional landscape which underlie the Protagonist's decision undefined and shadowy. We are left then, in the end, to only guess as to the reasons of the Protagonist's depth of feeling, and how he can be sure that his decision is the Right one. These men don't look back.This one's in color (unlike the first few films in the Moral Tales series). The films in this series end somewhat abruptly, and as the FIN burns on the screen, you may find yourself with some questions.

186790,A3SIRH8JWGYU80,1572522437,Kevin W. Koehler,"[0, 0]","The last of Eric Rohmer's Six Moral Tales begins with a man, Frederic (Bernard Verley) watching his wife step out of the shower. She continues to towel herself off, glancing back over her shoulder at him the doorway. It's the kind of genuine, uncontrived eroticism Frederic would find sexy if he weren't married to her.""Since my marriage,"" says Frederic, ""I find all women attractive. In their mundane tasks, I accord them that mystery I once denied almost all of them."" Frederic spends a lot of time observing the opposite sex (for someone with a presumably demanding occupation, we see him doing surprisingly little work), fantasizing about what it would be like to engage these ladies with flirtatious conversation. In this invented world, he is the sort passionate, dangerous figure he imagines beautiful women find irresistible. It's a marked contrast to the person he actually is, this being a Paris lawyer who stays home most nights, reads books on the train, and wears the same style of turtleneck every day.In an unusually impulsive act, Frederic allows himself to be talked into buying a plaid dress shirt by an attractive salesgirl. ""The salesgirl was very clever. She pretended not to give a damn."" It won't be the last time in the picture a character gets what they want by feigning disinterest in it (the converse is also true). The shirt isn't particularly becoming, truth be told - it's too tight and Frederic looks out of place in it. But he wears it anyway. It's not long afterwards that a woman named Chloe (Zouzou) reintroduces herself to his life.Often what makes films great are the questions they pose, not the ones they solve. Love in the Afternoon is full of questions. Can a man love two women at the same time? Where is the divide between innocent flirtation and adultery (it's not as simple as I'd imagine many think)? Is infidelity always morally licentious? Is monogamy by its very nature unsustainable without a certain degree of dishonesty, not to mention an elaborately fantastical interior life?Love in the Afternoon respects its audience enough not to give any easy answers, allowing us to come to our conclusions about the characters and their motivations. Indeed, the picture is refreshingly free of any kind of musical score, the hack filmmaker's bludgeoning tool to beat viewers into lockstep submission. Rohmer, per usual, takes what could be tiresome and formulaic (Rohmer himself has used the central conceit of the romantically-conflicted man in numerous other films, notably My Night at Maud's) and gives it a new life, a new perspective, and a new understanding. When Chloe reclines spectacularly, a vision, beckoning us from across the room, there is no reductionist moralizing, no wagging of fingers. There is just a beautiful woman, a married man, a bed, and ourselves.Interesting footnote: Actress/model/musician Zouzou was an icon of the swinging 60s in Europe, engaging in a fairly public romance with Rolling Stone Brian Jones.

Alcat ""Curiosity killed the cat, but sa...","[2, 2]","""Chloe in the Afternoon"" (= ""L'amour l'apres-midi"", 1972) is the last of Eric Rohmer's ""Six moral tales"". It is not a long film, but it manages to deal with issues such as love, monogamy, infidelity, and the impact that small decisions can have on couples.The main character is Frederic (Bernard Verley), a typical bourgeois immersed in his routine, married with one child, and with a wife that is expecting another son. Everything seems perfect, even though somehow monotonous, until the reappearance in his life of an old acquaintance, Chloe (Zouzou). That event suddenly tempts Frederic to be unfaithful to his wife Helene (Francoise Verley), something he merely thought about previously.Chloe is everything Frederic and Helene are not: spontaneous, volatile and bohemian. That is probably the reason why she seems to attract and repel Frederic at the same time. Chloe, who starts to meet Frederic in the afternoons, is a woman on a mission: she wants to have a child with blue eyes, like Frederic, and has decided that her former friend will be a perfect absent father. So, both Frederic and Chloe seem inclined to have an affair, albeit for different reasons... But will that happen?All in all, I think that ""Chloe in the Afternoon"" is a movie you might enjoy. It is slow, but has some interesting dialogues, and it is the kind of film that gives food for thought. This is far from being my favourite Rohmer film, but I don't regret watching it, and I consider that it deserves at least 3.5/5 stars.

One thing that distinguishes Chloe from the others is that photographer, Suze Randall, plays an au pair who likes to walk around nude while at home.  She's photographed many women nude, but this is the only film where I've ever seen her nude.  Also nude in this film are Franoise Verley, who plays the hero's wife, and Zouzou, who plays Chloe about whom the hero fantasizes (among many other women) during their afternoon lunch breaks.  The hero is played by Bernard Verley, but I don't know his relationship with Franoise--real husband/wife?",5,Review of Chloe in the Afternoon,1313020800,"08 11, 2011",2011,660,"['Chloe', 'Afternoon', 'Eric', 'Rohmer', 'film', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'other', 'Rohmer', 'film', 'have', 'idea', 'style', 'One', 'thing', 'Chloe', 'others', 'photographer', 'Suze', 'Randall', 'au', 'pair', 'who', 'walk', 'nude', 'home', 'photographed', 'many', 'women', 'nude', 'only', 'film', 'where', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'nude', 'Also', 'nude', 'film', 'are', 'Franoise', 'Verley', 'who', 'hero', 'wife', 'Zouzou', 'who', 'Chloe', 'whom', 'hero', 'many', 'other', 'women', 'afternoon', 'lunch', 'breaks', 'hero', 'played', 'Bernard', 'Verley', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'relationship', 'Franoise', 'real', 'husband/wife']",N/A

Filmed in 1972, the movie is dated now, populated by women in ultra-miniskirts, guys in tight suits with flared jackets, weird hair...you get the picture. But the focus is timeless: sophisticated bourgeois married couple with children nearly ripped asunder by threatened infidelity. Chloe is the bohemian outsider, a seductress with an agenda, and Frederic is her intended victim. The ending is sort of a shocker, a little over the top, but otherwise, wow, it's a corker.",4,"Really, really interesting",1105315200,"01 10, 2005",2005,563,"['Eric', 'Rohmer', 'series', 'Six', 'Moral', 'Tales', 'best', 'represented', 'Chloe', 'Afternoon', 'IMO', 'Filmed', '1972', 'movie', 'dated', 'now', 'populated', 'women', 'ultra-miniskirts', 'guys', 'tight', 'suits', 'flared', 'jackets', 'weird', 'hair', 'get', 'picture', 'focus', 'timeless', 'sophisticated', 'bourgeois', 'married', 'couple', 'children', 'nearly', 'ripped', 'asunder', 'threatened', 'infidelity', 'Chloe', 'bohemian', 'outsider', 'seductress', 'agenda', 'Frederic', 'intended', 'victim', 'ending', 'sort', 'shocker', 'little', 'top', 'otherwise', 'wow', 'corker']",N/A

Rohmer introduces Chloe,an impulsive,bohemian woman who lives with a man,she has fallen out of love with,and she is in need of a job.Frederick can't offer her one, already having two efficient secretaries, and has no room for another. They begin to meet in the afternoon as friends,and grow closer,he becoming more dependent on their meetings.He already has a voyeuristic appreciation of beautiful young women he sees passing him in the city streets.He is drawn towards crowds,the surge,the ebb and flow,the breaking free like a wave and going his own way.Chloe depends on his support in finding accommodation and in securing a job working in a clothes shop. When she comes to seduce him,he faces a moral dilemma.Chloe seems, every time Frederick mentions he's married and in love with his wife, like a bull to a red rag.She says she wants Frederick's child,as a mistress might.This is a lovely film, restrained in action,but dynamic in its use of dialogue.Frederick begins to realise the preciousness of the love he has for his Helene,whose release at the end is among the most emotionally devastating ever filmed,born by a sense ofcontrition in the face of hurt,with emotions so complicated, bittersweet,they modulate a new key amid suspicion,terrible disappointment and hopeful naivete. Rohmer's screenplay is immersed in the art of intelligent conversation.A subtle intelligence, of delicate wit and eloquent clarity is the bedrock of any Rohmer film.The last of the moral tales.",4,Love vs. passion: the pangs of anticipation,1380931200,"10 5, 2013",2013,1850,"['Love', 'Afternoon', 'perfectly', 'moral', 'exploration', 'desire', 'temptation', 'bounds', 'bourgeois', 'marriage.Chloe', 'Zouzou', 'mistress', 'old', 'friend', 'up', 'office.Frederick', 'Bernard', 'Verley', 'partner', 'small', 'office', 'happily', 'married', 'Helene', 'Francoise', 'Verley', 'now', '2nd', 'pregnancy', 'who', 'beautiful', 'also', 'English', 'professor', 'Rohmer', 'introduces', 'Chloe', 'impulsive', 'bohemian', 'woman', 'who', 'man', 'fallen', 'love', 'need', 'job.Frederick', 'ca', ""n't"", 'offer', 'one', 'already', 'having', 'two', 'efficient', 'secretaries', 'room', 'begin', 'meet', 'afternoon', 'friends', 'grow', 'closer', 'becoming', 'more', 'dependent', 'meetings.He', 'already', 'voyeuristic', 'appreciation', 'beautiful', 'young', 'women', 'passing', 'city', 'streets.He', 'drawn', 'towards', 'crowds', 'surge', 'ebb', 'flow', 'breaking', 'free', 'wave', 'going', 'own', 'way.Chloe', 'support', 'finding', 'accommodation', 'securing', 'job', 'working', 'clothes', 'shop', 'When', 'seduce', 'moral', 'dilemma.Chloe', 'time', 'Frederick', 'mentions', 'married', 'love', 'wife', 'bull', 'red', 'rag.She', 'Frederick', 'child', 'mistress', 'might.This', 'lovely', 'film', 'restrained', 'action', 'use', 'dialogue.Frederick', 'begins', 'realise', 'preciousness', 'love', 'Helene', 'release', 'end', 'most', 'emotionally', 'devastating', 'ever', 'filmed', 'born', 'sense', 'ofcontrition', 'face', 'hurt', 'emotions', 'so', 'complicated', 'bittersweet', 'modulate', 'new', 'key', 'suspicion', 'terrible', 'disappointment', 'hopeful', 'naivete', 'Rohmer', 'screenplay', 'immersed', 'art', 'intelligent', 'conversation.A', 'subtle', 'intelligence', 'delicate', 'wit', 'eloquent', 'clarity', 'bedrock', 'Rohmer', 'film.The', 'last', 'moral', 'tales']",N/A

Or, rather, she invites herself.  Chloe comes along as she shows up every afternoon in his office and spends part of the day with him, as if she were going for therapy - or maybe she's his therapist - as they become the closest of friends.  The conceit is she's going to him for moral support when actually it's him whose life is becoming enhanced.What's fun is you never see much on how his secretary reacts to the visitations of Chloe.  Chloe becomes such a routine, even for the secretary - who may think the relationship between her boss and his female friend is platonic or not - who treats Chloe as if it's the boss' sister or wife who drops in every day.What's amazing is how this film will stick with you.  I have seen it once and it was more than twenty years ago, yet I remember it as if I just saw it today.  Yet most films are so disposable, even a day later it can be difficult to recall the details.  So this one makes a huge impression.I rate the film four stars as it irks me I still have questions or concerns even after all these years.  Especially about the wife, who offers up a surprise of her own, but she is effectively in the background, as the POV of the film is the husband's and so his attitude towards her is shared by the film.I ordinarily prefer pat endings that are more satisfying than the one offered here.  However if offering up one of my favorite films, I'd say this one was in the top ten, just because like an excellent novel, you return to it again and again in your mind.  A favorite film is like that, you view it once and it is forever engrained in your mind.",4,Chloe is a fact of life,1236038400,"03 3, 2009",2009,1893,"['man', 'woman', 'are', 'meant', 'have', 'romance', 'will', 'happen', 'immediately', 'not', 'one', 'truisms', 'played', 'out', 'film.A', 'rather', 'dull', 'yet', 'attractive', 'happily', 'married', 'man', 'who', 'comfortably', 'life', 'segments', 'new', 'element', 'rather', 'Chloe', 'along', 'up', 'afternoon', 'office', 'part', 'day', 'were', 'going', 'therapy', 'maybe', 'therapist', 'become', 'closest', 'friends', 'conceit', 'going', 'moral', 'support', 'when', 'actually', 'life', 'becoming', 'enhanced.What', 'fun', 'never', 'see', 'much', 'how', 'secretary', 'reacts', 'visitations', 'Chloe', 'Chloe', 'such', 'routine', 'even', 'secretary', 'who', 'may', 'think', 'relationship', 'boss', 'female', 'friend', 'platonic', 'not', 'who', 'Chloe', 'boss', 'sister', 'wife', 'who', 'day.What', 'amazing', 'how', 'film', 'will', 'stick', 'have', 'seen', 'once', 'was', 'more', 'twenty', 'years', 'ago', 'yet', 'remember', 'just', 'saw', 'today', 'most', 'films', 'are', 'so', 'disposable', 'even', 'day', 'later', 'can', 'be', 'difficult', 'recall', 'details', 'So', 'one', 'huge', 'impression.I', 'rate', 'film', 'four', 'stars', 'still', 'have', 'questions', 'concerns', 'even', 'years', 'Especially', 'wife', 'who', 'up', 'surprise', 'own', 'effectively', 'background', 'POV', 'film', 'husband', 'so', 'attitude', 'shared', 'film.I', 'ordinarily', 'prefer', 'pat', 'endings', 'are', 'more', 'satisfying', 'one', 'offered', 'here', 'However', 'offering', 'up', 'one', 'favorite', 'films', ""'d"", 'say', 'one', 'was', 'top', 'ten', 'just', 'excellent', 'novel', 'return', 'again', 'again', 'mind', 'favorite', 'film', 'view', 'once', 'forever', 'engrained', 'mind']",N/A
