I bought it that day. After finally getting past the very funny BRAK SHOW i saw this set. I must say that it has it moments buy i really found season 1 way funnier. It is still worth it if your looking for a cheap laugh this is worth the money. For those who do not know, Sealab 2021 is just old clips from sealab 2020 (from the sixties) and cut and pasted together then re-dubbed to make pointless adventures and hillarous run ins with the crew and their crazy Captian Murhpy.",4,Finally it has come,1107648000,"02 6, 2005",2005,584,"['getting', 'hooked', 'first', 'season', 'i', 'was', 'over', 'joyed', 'when', 'learned', 'season', '2', 'was', 'dropping', 'Feb', '1', 'bought', 'day', 'finally', 'getting', 'very', 'funny', 'BRAK', 'SHOW', 'saw', 'set', 'must', 'say', 'buy', 'i', 'really', 'found', 'season', '1', 'way', 'funnier', 'still', 'worth', 'looking', 'cheap', 'laugh', 'money', 'who', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'Sealab', '2021', 'just', 'old', 'clips', 'sealab', '2020', 'sixties', 'cut', 'pasted', 'together', 'then', 're-dubbed', 'make', 'pointless', 'adventures', 'hillarous', 'run', 'ins', 'crew', 'crazy', 'Captian', 'Murhpy']",N/A
864351,A1CPXDDAK7OK57,B00069L0Z4,Denny Gibbons,"[7, 8]","Season 2 is when the series reached its comedic peak, in my opinion. There are some really great episodes in this collection, such as ""Der Dieb"", in which Murphy declares ""Martian law"" in response to the presence of a thief on Sealab; ""The Feast of Alvis"", where the crew struggles with religious diversity while Murphy prepares for Alvistime, a bastardized version of Christmas that worships a gun-toting outlaw named Alvis; and ""Hail, Squishface"", where Murphy inadvertantly causes Sealab to be overrun by cute-but-deadly creatures called gloops. This collection is, if anything, a reminder of how much Harry Goz is missed as the voice of Captain Murphy; he was the glue that held the show together, and it just completely fell apart after his death.The extras are of course terrible, as is typical with bizarre Adult Swim shows in DVD format, because the creators are so weird that they just can't bring themselves to do normal special features and must make everything strange and half-assed. The tribute to Harry Goz is alright, but it consists mainly of brown-nosing from the creators of Sealab, his son Michael Goz, and Bill Lobley (the voice of Sparks). Lobley, in particular, is rather nauseating to listen to because he is such an insufferable suck-up.However, the bad extras are the only reason that this item lost a star. The episodes are solid gold, and I would recommend this collection to any die-hard fan of this bizarre oceanic series.",4,"Hilarious episodes, bad extras",1122768000,"07 31, 2005",2005,1452,"['Season', '2', 'when', 'series', 'reached', 'comedic', 'peak', 'opinion', 'are', 'really', 'great', 'episodes', 'collection', 'such', 'Der', 'Dieb', 'Murphy', 'Martian', 'law', 'response', 'presence', 'thief', 'Sealab', 'Feast', 'Alvis', 'where', 'crew', 'religious', 'diversity', 'Murphy', 'prepares', 'Alvistime', 'bastardized', 'version', 'Christmas', 'gun-toting', 'outlaw', 'named', 'Alvis', 'Hail', 'Squishface', 'where', 'Murphy', 'inadvertantly', 'Sealab', 'be', 'overrun', 'cute-but-deadly', 'creatures', 'called', 'gloops', 'collection', 'anything', 'reminder', 'how', 'much', 'Harry', 'Goz', 'missed', 'voice', 'Captain', 'Murphy', 'was', 'glue', 'held', 'show', 'together', 'just', 'completely', 'fell', 'apart', 'death.The', 'extras', 'are', 'course', 'terrible', 'typical', 'bizarre', 'Adult', 'Swim', 'DVD', 'format', 'creators', 'are', 'so', 'weird', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'bring', 'do', 'normal', 'special', 'features', 'must', 'make', 'everything', 'strange', 'half-assed', 'tribute', 'Harry', 'Goz', 'alright', 'mainly', 'brown-nosing', 'creators', 'Sealab', 'son', 'Michael', 'Goz', 'Bill', 'Lobley', 'voice', 'Sparks', 'Lobley', 'particular', 'rather', 'nauseating', 'listen', 'such', 'insufferable', 'suck-up.However', 'bad', 'extras', 'are', 'only', 'reason', 'item', 'lost', 'star', 'episodes', 'are', 'solid', 'gold', 'would', 'recommend', 'collection', 'die-hard', 'fan', 'bizarre', 'oceanic', 'series']",N/A

It is just plain funnier.  The writing has definitely hit its stride and the episodes are all just so different from one another but just so enjoyable.  The episode where sealab is shown in the dark for the entire episode with only voices and a few air bubbles is freaking hilarious!  ""Hey Quinn, It's Captain Murphy"".  Or the episode where Murphy is trying to find the ""pro shop"".  Or ""TinFins"".  And don't let me forget the BIZARRO episode.  I don't think any one of these 13 episodes is weak unlike a few on the season one collection.  Plus bonus material this time, such as containing an unaired ""rough"" episode where Murphy sells his soul to the devil for some pie.  Funny.

Beginning with a thief running rampant throughout Sealab prompting Captain Murphy to declare ""martian law"" (unaware that what he means is martial law), and continuing with ""Hail, Squishface"" in which the crew encounters a multi-breeding organism that's too cute for it's own good (a pun towards Star Trek's ""Trouble With Tribbles""), a battle over organized religions and the right to worship ""Alviss"", and in what is the best episode of season 2, the aptly titled ""Bizzaro"" in which the crew meet their evil doubles.  Sealab 2021, much like many of the other programs featured on the Adult Swim lineup, is something you'll either love or hate.  It's not the laugh out loud comedy of animated shows like Family Guy, and there are some misses to go along with the hits, but for the most part Sealab 2021 is pure comedic joy.  The special features included on this two disc DVD set are a vast improvement over the features offered on season one, including commentaries on every episode (even though the creators don't really offer much insight at all) interviews with the cast, girls in bikinis, and an honest to God tribute to the late Harry Goz (voice of Captain Murphy) who always kept the show worth watching.",5,"Hilarious, better than the first season",1112227200,"03 31, 2005",2005,1315,"['second', 'season', 'Cartoon', 'Network', 'Adult', 'Swim', 'Sealab', '2021', 'even', 'funnier', 'second', 'season', 'Beginning', 'thief', 'running', 'rampant', 'Sealab', 'prompting', 'Captain', 'Murphy', 'declare', 'martian', 'law', 'unaware', 'what', 'martial', 'law', 'continuing', 'Hail', 'Squishface', 'crew', 'multi-breeding', 'organism', 'too', 'cute', 'own', 'good', 'pun', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Trouble', 'Tribbles', 'battle', 'organized', 'religions', 'right', 'worship', 'Alviss', 'what', 'best', 'episode', 'season', '2', 'aptly', 'titled', 'Bizzaro', 'crew', 'meet', 'evil', 'doubles', 'Sealab', '2021', 'much', 'many', 'other', 'programs', 'featured', 'Adult', 'Swim', 'lineup', 'something', ""'ll"", 'either', 'love', 'hate', 'not', 'laugh', 'loud', 'comedy', 'animated', 'shows', 'Family', 'Guy', 'are', 'misses', 'go', 'along', 'hits', 'most', 'part', 'Sealab', '2021', 'pure', 'comedic', 'joy', 'special', 'features', 'included', 'two', 'disc', 'DVD', 'set', 'are', 'vast', 'improvement', 'features', 'offered', 'season', 'one', 'including', 'commentaries', 'episode', 'even', 'creators', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'offer', 'much', 'insight', 'interviews', 'cast', 'girls', 'bikinis', 'honest', 'God', 'tribute', 'late', 'Harry', 'Goz', 'voice', 'Captain', 'Murphy', 'who', 'always', 'kept', 'show', 'worth', 'watching']",N/A

For those who haven't seen that many episodes will enjoy the classic Tinfins (but what makes this episode funny are the Grizzlebees commercials and Kid'n'Play apperances). One thing I would like to point out is that (although Murphy does appear in 3 or 5 more episodes in the 3rd box set) that after this set, Captain Murphy is gone to fight the Great Spice Wars (but in real life, the guy who played Murphy, Harry Goz, died from cancer and the Sealab creators decided it was best to retire his character, like Phil Hartman with Troy McClure and Lional Hutz from the Simpsons).
