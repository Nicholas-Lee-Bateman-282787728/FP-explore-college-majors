1553808,A1N1H9FB2LKVI3,B008IELRUM,DarthJustice,"[5, 5]","At 26, I can remember watching David the Gnome on Nick Jr. back in the early 90s when I was five and six years old. This is certainly a FAR cry from the likes of Dora the Explorer, I must say. Somehow, I had missed the fact this DVD set of the entire series had been released until December of 2012, a full five months after its release. I bought it almost a month later. To this day I can remember most vividly the episodes dealing with David granting the woodcutter three wishes and David and his kids helping a hurt woman who delivers milk to the gnomes.David the Gnome (which I remember being called The Wonderful World of David the Gnome on Nick Jr. in 1991 and 1992) follows the titular character David, a 399 year old gnome and doctor voiced by Happy Days alum Tom Bosley, and his wife Lisa as they travel the world helping other gnomes, animals, sometimes humans, and dealing with trolls.The show was the kind of show that adults somehow forgot to how to make in the years sine I was a kid. It was a fun and entertaining show that tried teaching you about the environment and being respectful to animals without you even realizing it was more than an entertaining morning Nick Jr. show. Today such a show would be shoving stuff down kids' throats and treating them like idiots. But that's another story.David the Gnome brought back a lot of happy memories for me, especially the theme song. Even after all these years, I still remembered the theme song and moments from the show like it was 1991 all over again.From an objective POV, it is funny what you might notice as an adult vs being a kid. Someone on another site mentioned how they found the trolls a lot scarier and more intimidating as a kid. Another is that sometimes the animation/mouth movements didn't match up with the voice acting.The DVD packing itself, I thought the cover and back were well done. I do wish the DVDs themselves were packaged a little differently. Basically it's four discs with two discs on both sides of the case. The way they're placed have two of the DVDs halfway on top of the other and all four have to go a certain way to be placed properly. It's a bit too much effort where none should be to get certain discs out and back in, but not a big deal.No special features that I noticed.One more thing to point out with this set, if you are like me and lived in the US and saw this on Nick Jr., don't expect the same opening (as seen on a Youtube video for the intro) you grew up with. The theme song is exactly the same, but it's a different opening sequence for the most part.A definite worthwhile buy if you were a fan of the show. Keep some tissues handy for the final episode. I've seen quite a few people, even as adults, who have reported crying--myself included when I watched the final episode this morning (and I'm not ashamed to admit it). Probably the saddest final episode of a show intended for kids I've ever seen.",5,"The Wonderful World Of David The Gnome, Indeed",1357776000,"01 10, 2013",2013,2922,"['26', 'can', 'remember', 'watching', 'David', 'Gnome', 'Nick', 'Jr.', 'back', 'early', '90s', 'when', 'was', 'five', 'six', 'years', 'old', 'certainly', 'FAR', 'cry', 'likes', 'Dora', 'Explorer', 'must', 'say', 'Somehow', 'had', 'missed', 'fact', 'DVD', 'set', 'entire', 'series', 'had', 'been', 'released', 'December', '2012', 'full', 'five', 'months', 'release', 'bought', 'almost', 'month', 'later', 'day', 'can', 'remember', 'most', 'vividly', 'episodes', 'dealing', 'David', 'granting', 'woodcutter', 'three', 'wishes', 'David', 'kids', 'helping', 'hurt', 'woman', 'who', 'milk', 'gnomes.David', 'Gnome', 'remember', 'being', 'called', 'Wonderful', 'World', 'David', 'Gnome', 'Nick', 'Jr.', '1991', '1992', 'titular', 'character', 'David', '399', 'year', 'old', 'gnome', 'doctor', 'voiced', 'Happy', 'Days', 'alum', 'Tom', 'Bosley', 'wife', 'Lisa', 'travel', 'world', 'helping', 'other', 'gnomes', 'animals', 'sometimes', 'humans', 'dealing', 'trolls.The', 'show', 'was', 'kind', 'show', 'somehow', 'forgot', 'how', 'make', 'years', 'sine', 'was', 'kid', 'was', 'fun', 'entertaining', 'show', 'tried', 'teaching', 'environment', 'being', 'respectful', 'animals', 'even', 'realizing', 'was', 'more', 'entertaining', 'morning', 'Nick', 'Jr.', 'show', 'Today', 'show', 'would', 'be', 'shoving', 'stuff', 'down', 'kids', 'throats', 'treating', 'idiots', 'story.David', 'Gnome', 'brought', 'back', 'lot', 'happy', 'memories', 'especially', 'theme', 'song', 'Even', 'years', 'still', 'remembered', 'theme', 'song', 'moments', 'show', 'was', '1991', 'objective', 'POV', 'funny', 'what', 'might', 'notice', 'adult', 'vs', 'being', 'kid', 'Someone', 'site', 'mentioned', 'how', 'found', 'trolls', 'lot', 'scarier', 'more', 'intimidating', 'kid', 'sometimes', 'animation/mouth', 'movements', 'did', ""n't"", 'match', 'up', 'voice', 'acting.The', 'DVD', 'packing', 'thought', 'cover', 'back', 'were', 'well', 'done', 'do', 'wish', 'DVDs', 'were', 'packaged', 'little', 'differently', 'Basically', 'four', 'discs', 'two', 'discs', 'sides', 'case', 'way', ""'re"", 'placed', 'have', 'two', 'DVDs', 'halfway', 'top', 'other', 'four', 'have', 'go', 'certain', 'way', 'be', 'placed', 'properly', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'effort', 'where', 'none', 'should', 'be', 'get', 'certain', 'discs', 'back', 'not', 'big', 'deal.No', 'special', 'features', 'noticed.One', 'more', 'thing', 'point', 'out', 'set', 'are', 'lived', 'US', 'saw', 'Nick', 'Jr.', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'same', 'opening', 'seen', 'Youtube', 'video', 'intro', 'grew', 'up', 'theme', 'song', 'exactly', 'same', 'different', 'opening', 'sequence', 'most', 'part.A', 'definite', 'worthwhile', 'buy', 'were', 'fan', 'show', 'Keep', 'tissues', 'handy', 'final', 'episode', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'quite', 'few', 'people', 'even', 'adults', 'who', 'have', 'reported', 'crying', 'included', 'when', 'watched', 'final', 'episode', 'morning', ""'m"", 'not', 'ashamed', 'admit', 'Probably', 'saddest', 'final', 'episode', 'show', 'intended', 'kids', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen']",N/A

I grew up with this show and wanted my child to share the experience. My child loves it! The box set is perfect. No complaints at all. The first handful of episodes do lack the intro that most are familiar with but I think this was how the show was broadcast originally. Later episodes then offer the intro with the &#34;Look around you&#34; theme song. I am aware that the American broadcast was censored with some minor edits. I am only aware of a few of the original inclusions but I have not watched closely enough yet to see if they have been included in this box set or not. It would be amazing to me if this set includes the uncut versions but if not, I couldn't care much.
