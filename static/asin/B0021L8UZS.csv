Hugh Grant can't make movies in the UK any more because the British seem to make only about one movie every couple of years.  So, to pay for the fuel for his Aston Martin, Grant has to accept scripts that seem to have been written by machines.

Of course we all know that romantic comedies are going to recycle plot elements and themes, so that in and of itself isn't a bad thing. However, in the case of this movie, it seems like almost everything was done half-heartedly. The movie has some impressive lead actors who do a pretty decent job of acting. However, it seems like this movie falls prey to the same thing that plagues a lot of romantic comedies. It tries to pile up stock scenes without putting much thought or effort into them. In the case of this movie it leads to the viewer not caring too much about the characters because there isn't much effective back story or buildup to many scenes. Hugh Grant can be an excellent actor for romantic comedies, but in this one, his trademark style seems totally out-of-place. There doesn't seem to be much chemistry between him and Sarah Jessica Parker. You are left wondering how they ever got together and what they really see in each other. The one thing that can be said about the movie is that it does not have too many embarrassingly bad scenes of the type that make you cringe. Most of the scenes involving cultural differences or misunderstandings are done in a mild way which doesn't seem outlandish.

1247430,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B0021L8UZS,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 2]","First, I just want to say that this film probably had some of the worst publicity campaigns of any film I've ever seen.  The trailers for this film did it no justice, told you absolutely NOTHING about what you would experience and really made this film look dull beyond belief.  I mean, I had no idea what this film was about and I didn't really want to.Okay, now onto my review.:-DIt looks like the response to this film was kind of all over the place.  It's a pretty even spread here from people who loathed it to people who loved it (and everywhere in between).  Personally, we were recommended this movie from a friend who told us it was hilarious.  I'm still a little baffled that this friend recommended this film, since my wife and I recently went through separation much like the one in the film (yes, I was guilty and yes, she was crazy) and so throughout the films first half I was extremely uncomfortable (lord, please don't let this start a fight), but I must say that the film is balanced very nicely and by the films end you have this warmth inside that validates the films dramatic touches.No, this film is not hilarious, but maybe that's why I liked it so much.I was telling my wife that one of the reasons I liked this film was that it didn't go the obvious route and make everything a slapstick gag.  There were many scenes in the film that very easily could have gone over the top (take the bear scene for instance) but instead of pushing it, this film likes to play it a little more controlled.  Yes, it's funny, but it's not so outrageous that your roll your eyes.  I thought the Bargain Barn scene was another nicely done comical scene (""A sweater for $9.99?!?!?"") that could have been overplayed but was edited nicely.The film tells of a New York couple going through a separation after the husband has an affair.  It appears that they were having some troubles before the affair took place, and he desperately wants to make things work but she isn't so sure.  When they both witness a murder they are sent into witness protection and have to spend a week together, in the backwards baroness of Ray, Wyoming.With no distractions, they find that they never really fell out of love.I love Hugh Grant.  I'm not the biggest fan of Sarah Jessica Parker, but I have been known to enjoy her on occasion (`The Family Stone').  Here she feeds off of Grant beautifully (and visa-versa).  They really compliment one another.  Grant's wit is effortless and he really knows how to make any situation funny (""I will pay."").  The best part about their pairing though is that they make a really believable couple.  Despite the fact that the overall plot is predictable and VERY far-fetched, they make it work because you BELIEVE them.Add to their aura the fact that the entire cast (which includes a snappy Elizabeth Moss from `Mad Men') is spot on in nearly every way and you have a surefire crowd pleaser that hits nearly every mark.No, this is not the perfect comedy, and at times it can even appear to be too serious for its own genre, but in the end it was a satisfying and rewarding movie experience that both my wife and I thoroughly enjoyed.",4,Did you hear about this movie?,1270771200,"04 9, 2010",2010,3156,"['First', 'just', 'want', 'say', 'film', 'probably', 'had', 'worst', 'publicity', 'campaigns', 'film', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'trailers', 'film', 'did', 'justice', 'told', 'absolutely', 'NOTHING', 'what', 'would', 'experience', 'really', 'made', 'film', 'look', 'dull', 'belief', 'mean', 'had', 'idea', 'what', 'film', 'was', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'want', 'to.Okay', 'now', 'review', '-DIt', 'looks', 'response', 'film', 'was', 'kind', 'place', 'pretty', 'even', 'spread', 'here', 'people', 'who', 'loathed', 'people', 'who', 'loved', 'everywhere', 'Personally', 'were', 'recommended', 'movie', 'friend', 'who', 'told', 'was', 'hilarious', ""'m"", 'still', 'little', 'baffled', 'friend', 'recommended', 'film', 'wife', 'recently', 'went', 'separation', 'much', 'one', 'film', 'yes', 'was', 'guilty', 'yes', 'was', 'crazy', 'so', 'films', 'first', 'half', 'was', 'extremely', 'uncomfortable', 'lord', 'please', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'start', 'fight', 'must', 'say', 'film', 'balanced', 'very', 'nicely', 'films', 'end', 'have', 'warmth', 'films', 'dramatic', 'touches.No', 'film', 'not', 'hilarious', 'maybe', 'why', 'liked', 'so', 'much.I', 'was', 'telling', 'wife', 'one', 'reasons', 'liked', 'film', 'was', 'did', ""n't"", 'go', 'obvious', 'route', 'make', 'everything', 'slapstick', 'gag', 'were', 'many', 'scenes', 'film', 'very', 'easily', 'could', 'have', 'gone', 'top', 'take', 'bear', 'scene', 'instance', 'instead', 'pushing', 'film', 'play', 'little', 'more', 'controlled', 'Yes', 'funny', 'not', 'so', 'outrageous', 'roll', 'eyes', 'thought', 'Bargain', 'Barn', 'scene', 'was', 'nicely', 'done', 'comical', 'scene', 'sweater', '9.99', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'overplayed', 'was', 'edited', 'nicely.The', 'film', 'tells', 'New', 'York', 'couple', 'going', 'separation', 'husband', 'affair', 'were', 'having', 'troubles', 'affair', 'took', 'place', 'desperately', 'make', 'things', 'work', ""n't"", 'so', 'sure', 'When', 'witness', 'murder', 'are', 'sent', 'witness', 'protection', 'have', 'spend', 'week', 'together', 'backwards', 'baroness', 'Ray', 'Wyoming.With', 'distractions', 'find', 'never', 'really', 'fell', 'love.I', 'love', 'Hugh', 'Grant', ""'m"", 'not', 'biggest', 'fan', 'Sarah', 'Jessica', 'Parker', 'have', 'been', 'known', 'enjoy', 'occasion', 'Family', 'Stone', 'Here', 'Grant', 'beautifully', 'visa-versa', 'really', 'compliment', 'one', 'Grant', 'wit', 'effortless', 'really', 'how', 'make', 'situation', 'funny', 'will', 'pay.', 'best', 'part', 'pairing', 'though', 'make', 'really', 'believable', 'couple', 'fact', 'overall', 'plot', 'predictable', 'VERY', 'far-fetched', 'make', 'work', 'BELIEVE', 'them.Add', 'aura', 'fact', 'entire', 'cast', 'snappy', 'Elizabeth', 'Moss', 'Mad', 'Men', 'spot', 'nearly', 'way', 'have', 'surefire', 'crowd', 'pleaser', 'nearly', 'mark.No', 'not', 'perfect', 'comedy', 'times', 'can', 'even', 'appear', 'be', 'too', 'serious', 'own', 'genre', 'end', 'was', 'satisfying', 'rewarding', 'movie', 'experience', 'wife', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed']",Did You Hear About the Morgans?
1247431,A2QHM5HBSIXRL4,B0021L8UZS,Andy Orrock,"[0, 0]","I expect better from writer/director Marc Lawrence.  The creative genius behind theMiss Congenialityfranchise, Lawrence has a deft touch for rom-coms with goofy, offbeat heros and heroines.  Of course, with Miss Congeniality and the equally winningTwo Weeks Notice (Widescreen Edition) (Snap Case), he had a little weapon called Sandra Bullock on his side.  But Two Weeks' Notice (yes, there should be an apostrophe in there, thank you) also featured a very good Hugh Grant.  Lawrence and Grant continued their partnership on the sneaky-goodMusic and Lyrics (Widescreen Edition).  Not only was that a winning comedy, it also served as a great primer on the creative process.  Moreover, it featured a pitch-perfect Easter Egg: the video-within-the-movie that harkens back to Grant's character's Andrew Ridgeley-like existence as ""the other guy"" in a Wham-like pop rock super-nova.  That confection was the creation of a genius.  [The song - 'Pop Goes My Heart' - can stand toe-to-toe with any hit from that early-80s era.]By contrast, 'Morgans' is a weak outing for both Lawrence and Grant.  The script is a dud.  Grant and co-star SJP accidentally oversee a murder and are forced into a Witness Relocation Program.  That's a highfalutin cover story for the basics of Lawrence's story: a sort of 'Cranky Blue Staters go to Red State and find life is different, but ultimately not too bad' narrative.  The big problem is obvious: zero chemistry between Grant and SJP.  [How were these two characters ever attracted to each other?]  And the story's resolution is insipid:  Sam Elliot.  Horseshoe.  Ringer.  I mean, come on.  Leslie Nielsen, maybe, in full-on Frank Drebin mode.  But Sam Elliot? No.  And stop calling me Shirley.This movie is a low point for Hugh Grant.  He needs to aim higher.  What happened to the Hugh Grant who set everyone back on their heels with his brilliant performance in the Weitz brothers' screen adaptation of Nick Hornby'sAbout a Boy (Widescreen Edition)?

For starters, it's the oldest and most generic form of movie there is; a fish out of water, love story. Furthermore, its three act structure is as predictable as Seattle weather. That being said, let's get on with it.Hugh Grant and Sarah Jessica parker star as - you guessed it - The Morgans. They are a married couple whose relationship suffers primarily from what Hugh Grant's marriage did in real life; his inability to keep it in his pants.I'll admit I am not a Hugh Grant fan and that that could have played some part in me not loving this movie. I have seen him in films where he has brought some talent to the table, such as About a Boy. But here we get the Hugh Grant we are all too familiar with; the guy he's played countless times. He has a beautiful woman who loves him; he cheats on her and or takes her for granted, and then spends the remainder of the film trying to swoop her back into his arms with his `witty' humor. Ugh.All of the above hold true for his character in this film, Paul Morgan. His wife Meryl (Parker) is a lot more enjoyable to be around, and you often wonder why she ever married him in the first place.Paul has asked Meryl to go out on a dinner date with him, as they are separated and no longer live together. She agrees and we get to know the two of them and we enjoy a few mild laughs. After dinner, right out of left field, with no build-up at all - they witness a murder. Some might argue that it was supposed to be completely random and that's why there were no events leading up to this random turn in the film. In my opinion, if that was the director's intention, he failed miserably, as it just seems misplaced in the film altogether. We have no idea who the character is who is murdered, or why. He is just thrown out of a window by a creepy man, and Meryl mutters something about that being her client.This sets up the whole movie and had it been done better, the film would not have suffered as badly as it did. We have no back-story for this bad-guy-killer and never learn who he is. I get that the point of this film is to focus on the relationship between Meryl and Paul. But if that's the route you want to take, you don't introduce a murder plot!The two are placed in protective custody by the U.S. Marshals. They will be sent off to the small town of Ray Wyoming; thus being the classic fish out of water. Meryl all but resists going as she is a New Yorker and would sooner be killed, than live in a small town.They arrive and discover they will be living with another married couple, who are undercover U.S. Marshals. Sam Elliot and Mary Streenburgen (who seems to be in just about every movie anymore), play their hosts: Clay and Emma Wheeler. Naturally the Wheelers couldn't be any different from the Morgans. They are trigger happy country-folk who live in the sticks and don't own cable; they watch nothing but John Wayne and Clint Eastwood movies.From there things somehow get more ridiculous, as we see everything coming from a mile away. It's almost like the writer and director (Marc Lawrence) wants us to know what's coming. He has Hugh Grant holding up bear repellent spray I don't know how many times, and he has him read bear warning signs more than once as well. Can you say foreshadow?Needless to say, the one-dimensional villain finds the Morgans and makes trouble for them in the third act. I would like to point out that the guy, who plays him (Michael Kelly), is at least a great actor. Kelly has a bright future ahead of him, if he can manage to steer clear of roles in bad movies like this.I'd also like to point out that just because I'm a dude, doesn't mean I don't appreciate `chick flicks.' I have enjoyed several of them, to include Two Weeks Notice; which had Hugh Grant in it as well, and was also written and directed by Marc Lawrence. I would just rather watch a romantic comedy that is unique and has some brains in the screenplay, like Along Came Polly or Serendipity. The people acting in this film were funny, but the things that happened to them were not.Had it not been for Sam Elliot and Mary Streenburgen's classic chemistry; and Sarah Jessica Parker's terrific performance, the movie would have fallen flat on its face. Parker is one of the best actresses in Hollywood and she plays her character brilliantly - it's just too bad she didn't have more to work with.There are a few more laughs that we enjoy later on in the film as well; but I can't help but feel it would have been better off having Sarah Jessica Parker being sent to Wyoming alone and interacting with Elliot and Streenburgen. Notice how I didn't mention a part for Hugh Grant?",2,Did You Hear about the Morgans?

1247452,A1JV4QKTEB7QBL,B0021L8UZS,"Diana F. Von Behren ""reneofc""","[0, 0]","Director Marc Lawrence's 2009 comedy ""Did You Hear About the Morgans?"" features the usually sleekly coiffed and fashionably glamored Sarah Jessica Parker as an older and slightly more pinched Carrie Bradshaw of ""Sex and the City"" fame and her estranged husband, an unfaithful Mr. Big character played by the one time charming Hugh Grant in a vapid cliched romp absolutely devoid of chemistry and badly timed jokes.In an attempt to discuss their failed marriage, the Morgans sit down to dinner and unfortunately witness a murder which puts their lives in jeopardy.  Pathetically played police officers insist on sending the sad couple to the Big Sky of Wyoming to the welcoming arms of Mr. and Mrs. NRA---the ever hunky Sam Elliot and the winsome Mary Steenburgen (the only two members of the cast that can do anything right with a script that has little redeeming value)where Parker does her best to bemoan her New Yorklessness and Grant perpetually winces at her incessant and expected badgering regarding his infidelity.UGH!  Of course, the villain figures out where they are thanks to the couple's mutually neurotic assistants and the small town residents rally to protect the Morgans aka the Fosters who they have come to regard as native sons in just one short week.Intended as a charming entertainment along the lines ofTwo Weeks Notice (Keepcase)andMusic and Lyrics [Blu-ray], two other Lawrence directed romantic comedies starring and attempting to capitalize on Hugh Grant's boyish charm, ""Did You Hear About the Morgans?"" fails miserably on many levels.  Parker and Grant have absolutely no chemistry; Grant's pained expressions get old fast as does Lawrence's attempt to work Parker's reputation as New York City's finest fashionista with a know-all iPhone toting zeal for her all-consuming career as real estate mogul with the mostess.  If I see her sporting another expensive cowboy hat a la the 80s, I think I will scream . . . no maybe just yawn.Its not that the jokes aren't funny--given a better delivery they could have had the audience chortling enthusiastically as this pair from the urban jungle ineptly lands in a place where street smarts do not matter.  What worked for Grant in the ever popularNotting Hill [HD DVD] and the equally feel goodAbout a Boydies miserably on the vine here.  An older Grant needs more sophisticated material where his witty repartee coincides with his more advanced years.  Parker, on the other hand, needs to continue to play Carrie Bradshaw in ad nauseum revivals ofSex and the City: The Movie (Widescreen Edition)installments or completely shelve this persona once and for all and try something else.  Its not that she isn't good in romantic comedy--thinkFailure to Launch [Blu-ray]--its just that she pairs as well with Grant as a merlot does with a salmon entree.Bottom line? Marc Lawrence's romantic comedy ""Did You Hear About the Morgans?"" tries to be a scintillating spectacular of cutesy jokes delivered by Hugh Grant and deflected by the object of his affections, New York's poster gal, Sarah Jessica Parker.  Without the buoyancy of chemistry between the two leads, the only thing this flick has going for itself is rustic couple Sam Elliot and Mary Steenburgen whose down-to-earth cowboy stability and laid back sense of fun keeps this review from being a one star un-wonder.

1247453,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B0021L8UZS,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[1, 1]","Normally, Sarah Jessica Parker disgusts me even on a bright, sunny day in New Mexico (not Wyoming, because this film was filmed in NM, only set in WY...point??). Hugh Grant of course is a perennial favorite, though I always think of him as a 2nd-string comic actor. These two play a separated couple who witness a death and get sent to ""Wyoming"" under Witness Protection Program.As another reviewer says, that's basically it. A murderer who appears to have the resources of Ben Gates from NATIONAL TREASURE eventually tracks them, but in the meantime they waggle their booties in the ol' west, under the care of the sheriff, played by the ever-marvelous Sam Elliott and his onscreen wife, Mary Steenburgen. The town physician, a sweetie pie and handsome-devil-in-jeans, impressed me the most. Sad.I'd say the humor from Elliott is just about the best thing here, but of course the real treat is the combination of Hugh-the-British-Wiseacre rubbed alongside. However, a badly blown opportunity is to be seen in his confrontations with Wilford Brimley. Those are, I'd say...unique. It reminded me of the last time I watched an Englishman in the west (John Hurt in WILD BILL). Equally not funny. Then again, Hurt wasn't meant to be funny.Obviously this will bring NOTTING HILL to mind, which in spite of the equally noxious Julia Roberts, was 100% better. It also strikes me that the chemistry we saw in THE PROPOSAL between Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds, who also played irritated rivals, is so crucial to a thing like this. It isn't here, though it is the magic this film needed. Therefore......this film made me wonder: are we jaded, angry or tired? It isn't a lack of quality here, it can't be as bad as I'm picturing it. Sure, Sarah hawks her jewelry line onscreen somehow, but it's a wholesome enough film and we are always harping that there aren't enough such films. This really deserves its PG rating. If this film had been done in 1984 I assure you it'd be a maximus classicus.Even without resorting to citing the 1980s, this thing ought to have worked well enough. It is another sadly-tossed-together-combo-of-has-beens, but those can be funny and charming. This is a wet weekend, and the likes of Hugh Grant and others ought to know better.Did I mention I liked all the cool guns?Today it just seems to wilt onscreen. It is quiet enough without the odd, awkward sagging at regular intervals. I guess Sarah's really horrific ""acting"" destroys the usual chemistry Hugh Grant can create. I mean, he looked better hugging Sam Elliott than he did with Sarah.Poor Sarah. I truly think she is the element that destroyed this film. All I can conclude is that beauty is always in the eye of the film-viewer.

Several times I found it funny, other times not so much, but overall it kept a smile on my face and I think it's entertaining.  The scenes of the countryside near Cody, Wyoming (where I've been and spent a few days myself, and can attest to it's excellent beauty having seen it firsthand), and the friendly townspeople made me feel happy while watching it.  Which is sort of major as I tend to depression and usually movies which were made recently have a tendency to make my depression worse.  One thing though, they're both cheaters (yes, in the adultery sense), but that is to be expected from the characters within almost every modern romantic comedy, it seems (a sign of the times maybe?).  There's nothing particularly deep in this movie, other than the message about how ugly it is to hide things from your spouse, and also maybe the message of how stupid city people can be; it's just a pleasant movie to watch, sort of like an episode of the Andy Griffith show.

It's a dry, British humor that sometimes had me snorting laughter. He almost always is saying something funny in this film. I must admit that I'd want to bonk him on the head if he were my husband, tell him to please, for crying out loud, take SOMEthing seriously, but as an audience member, I really enjoyed how his character was always ""on.""The plot is laughable: Grant and Parker are the Morgans, a city-dwelling and sophisticated separated couple who, on the night they have what the husband hopes will be a new start to their relationship in the form of a dinner where they can actually talk about the reasons for their separation and how to get back together, end up witnessing a murder that causes them to ultimately enter witness protection. Together. In a rural town. Being guarded by an utterly-countrified Sam Elliot and rifle-toting Mary Steenburgen.There's nothing about the plot that really stood out in an exceptional way.

1247465,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B0021L8UZS,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[1, 1]","Did you hear about the Morgans not being a very good comedy? Holy crap, what does it say about a movie when the best parts about it are the DVD's audio commentary and gag reel? Such be the case for DID YOU HEAR ABOUT THE MORGANS?, a film that not even its two ordinarily dependable leads can extract from the sucky dregs. Hugh Grant and Sarah Jessica Parker do their damndest but even their huge likability isn't enough to surmount the cruddy scriptwriting. Crazy thing is, if you listen to the audio commentary by the director and Hugh and Sarah Jessica, there's no dearth of good chemistry when it's just them being themselves.It's hard to quit Park Avenue for the boonies, especially if you're a power couple used to the posh things in life. Or even a past tense power couple. Paul Morgan is a successful lawyer. Meryl Morgan is a high end real estate broker, and their divorce is about to be finalized. Except that Paul - he who'd bollocksed things up - is seeking to reconcile. He talks Meryl into a dinner and, later walking it off, the two end up witnessing a murder. The assassin having glimpsed their mugs, it's off to the Witness Relocation Program for Paul and Meryl Morgan. Or, as they're now pseudonymed, the Fosters. In mid-flight, they learn from the laconic NYPD official that they'll be hiding out in a tiny town called Ray, Wyoming. To which a straight-faced Paul asks: ""Is that anywhere near Phil, Wyoming?"" Oh, these superior city slickers just won't stop with their jokes.In Ray, Wyoming, Paul and Meryl fall into the custody of a grizzled county sheriff and his gun-toting, non-vegetarian wife, and let me interject here how very welcome are Sam Elliott and Mary Steenburgen who both lend a warm, redeeming element to the picture. They're so down to earth they can't help but stabilize the goofy story somewhat. But they can't be in every scene. Maybe because, on the set, Mary Steenburgen is a notorious giggler.I was tremendously bored for most of the film. For whatever reason (cough*scriptwriting*cough), Hugh and Sarah Jessica on screen just don't click together. Their bicker banter isn't amusing and feels forced. If there's one person absolutely not meant for big open American spaces with all the rurality and the agriculture, it has to be Hugh Grant. He just looks lost and seems to resign himself to blinking a lot. And I normally love Sarah Jessica Parker, but maybe my shallow affection is tied in to those curly locks of hers. With her flattened tresses, she seems less adorable, more shrill, less sex in the city, more ennui in the boonies.The humor doesn't break new ground. It, in fact, deserves to have quotation marks wrapped around it. In cinema, the ""humorous"" culture clash between overbearing urbanites and the rubes had been explored as far back as in GREEN ACRES and, before that, in flicks like THE EGG AND I. And I never once thought the skit of a city slicker ineptly milking that cow was ever funny. There's also an unessential sub-plot which tracks Paul and Meryl's dueling respective assistants. And yet Wilfred Brimley's (even more grizzled than Sam Elliott) dismissal of Hugh Grant as a tea drinker did make me laugh. Ultimately, DID YOU HEAR ABOUT THE MORGANS? isn't as good as a nap but better than no-hopers such as GHOSTS OF GIRLFRIENDS PAST or ALL ABOUT STEVE. I guess the allure of these two aging heartthrobs still holds some sway. Only, dear God, please hurry them back to the big city. There's absolutely no call for Hugh Grant to terrorize that grizzly bear.The DVD's bonus stuff: an enjoyable audio Commentary by director Marc Lawrence and Hugh Grant and Sarah Jessica Parker; ""Location, Location, Location!"" - the Making Of the film featurette (00:18:14 minutes long);

I like Sarah Jessica Parker and despite the bad press and the back alley uplifting from Hugh Grant, I actually enjoy him as well.  I think the movie started out with an overused premise and the backdrop clich&eacute; of a fish out of water.  It isn't a bad foundation and I am sure we will see many more movies with this as a building block, but this one fell far short, lacking any form of sincerity.Paul Morgan, (Hugh Grant) and Meryl Morgan (Sarah Jessica Parker) are two New York City dwellers and they are having marital problems.  Do all marriages in New York City have problems?  They are out to dinner and are discussing their issues when they decide to go on a walk.  Inadvertently they see a murder and are shipped off to Wyoming in the witness protection plan.  None of these movies ever want you to participate in a witness protection plan.  They all seem to fail.There are a few funny lines in the movie.  I actually did laugh a couple of times.  Most of the movie is awkward and superficial.  It seems like you are watching a bunch of people who actually do not believe they are really the characters they are playing.  It seems like everyone is simply going through the motions to collect a paycheck.  Hugh Grant plays the same character he has played close to twenty times now and he seems more tired and aloof than he does interesting and cute.  Whatever happened to that guy from Four Weddings and a Funeral?I can't say that you absolutely shouldn't watch the movie but I can say that if you gave me a list of 100 movies it would probably be in the bottom 10.  I honestly do not know much about Elisabeth Moss but she was the highlight.  She was interesting and captivating in the few scenes she participated in, stealing my interest away from the highly overpaid stars.  I like a romantic comedy as much as the next guy but this movie was missing a couple of key ingredients.  Romance and comedy.Again, I have seen fare worse but as far as entertainment purposes there are so many other things I would prefer doing besides admitting to seeing this movie.

1247482,A1EHTFVSD0H7I6,B0021L8UZS,Kelly Klepfer,"[0, 2]","This film is a solid three-star, middle-of-the-road film. Adequately entertaining, charming and amusing in some spots and predictable and annoying in others.I viewed it with four twenty-something girls. They all liked it better than I did and thought it was funny and sweet and all thought that the negative reviews were overdone.The negative reviews I've heard were mostly about the lack of spark between the Morgans, Paul and Meryl. I thought Grant (Paul) and Parker (Meryl) did okay with the subject matter. Not great, but okay. For starters, this isn't a cutesy chick-flick where boy meets girl, they fall in love, one of them does something stupid or misreads the other followed by the sweet scene that pulls them back together when they discover they can't live without each other. This is a film that deals with a very broken marriage with some pretty hefty issues. The lack of spark was understandable the first half or so of the film. The issue for me was the quick resolution and some roller coaster emotional backlash. Didn't quite make sense and the challenges faced by the couple kind of sucked the funny potential out of it.Beyond the relationship issues is a life and death plot and the secondary characters. Neither made the film a must see either.

It was so corny it was almost insulting.  Jessica Sarah Parker is annoying doing her usual stammering, high-strung  persona, flipping her hair non-stop and looking like a little girl tottering around in mommy's high heels.

I truly wish I was watching something else when I watched this!  Once again my wife picked out a movie for us to watch.  This is the woman who has picked out CATCH AND RELEASE nad NEW IN TOWN.  Lets say we are getting close to grounds for divorce here.  Seriously even my wife couldn't believe how DEAD this movie was.  We love Hugh Grant but he just wasn't funny here.  He looked very uncomfortable doing this part.  As for Parker, where was the director?  She came across as a whinny bitchy sterotypical New Yorker.  I am sure those from New York hated her too.  Elliot and Steenburgen, two wonderful actors,  while were the best thing in the movie, had nothing to do or add to the movie.  Elliot was a U.S. marshall and carried a gun but never used it and the only action he got in the movie was pitching horse shoes and milking a cow.  That scene where he is milking and Parker is telling him about her affair is one of the most badly written and awkward scenes I have seen.  No wonder Elliot hid behind the cow's ass during the scene, maybe he was telling the audience something.  I really felt sorry for the bear  He wasn't cute nor brave and even he looked embarrassed.  The plot was choppy at the first and it never really clear why they , Grant and Parker, were apart.  It was here that the two assistants were seen and for some reason they had more to do and chemistry than the main actors.  Of course they were not developed and they too were short changed in plot.There were about 6 lines in the movie where I similed or laughed, but then again I am hard of hearing and maybe I wanted to laugh at something.  There was one long dragged out scene where Steenburgen taught Parker to shoot.  It was long , way too long and short on humor.  I kept wondering why Elliot who was there didn't try to teach Grant to shoot.  Elliot was a marshall so he was trained to shoot.  There was the tossed in idea that this was Elliot's last job, why it was there I have no idea.Of course the bad guy finds them and comes after them.  This is not unexpected, after all this is bad wrilting 101.  The climax, dare I say that, was at a rodeo.  Excuse me, my wife is telling me that there was no climax.  Hmmm I think she is right!  Two people in  a mangy cow suit is not a climax.  Especially when the bad guy is hit in the head with a horse shoe, but this is the West.The minor characters got thier names in the credits but they were not that noticeable in the movie.  The town of Ray Wyoming was given the quick sterotypical cliche whitewash, thus robbing it of any charm it may have had.The ending, well it sucked! Grant and Parker adopt a Chinesse baby and she get pregant by Grant and live happy ever after in New York.  The thing is the one point that the movie was making was that these two found happiness away from New York and that they finally began to love Ray, Wyoming and this led me to think they would go back there to lilve.  Stupid me, I forgott about bad wrilting 101.One last thing, we saw the movie Killers starring Ashton Kructer[spelling?]  and he and that mvoie were 10 times better than this.

While I can't quite understand the first reaction, and while I can sympathize with the second since it's probably not worth it to get worked up about a movie, in what follows I only want to speak for my own experience, and why I found this film not only bad but obnoxiously so, to the point where it makes me cynical about Hollywood.  There are so many brilliant writers out there, and so many good actors, and so many filmmakers that have original visions and interesting stories that could be told about so many things that I have to find it sad this movie got funded and filmed by the studios.  Just take a look at the many wonderful independent and international films that play at Sundance or Cannes or Toronto, and then never really manage to play in the major theaters in America, because they are allegedly aiming at a narrow niche audience -- since when did excellent storytelling and powerful artistry become a niche market? -- but this one is as niche as it comes.Somehow someone in Hollywood is convinced that a broad swath of the moviegoing public wants to hear stories about pampered, annoying, well-to-do city folk, on the brink of divorce, who somehow discover that they really do love one another after being put into a witness protection program in small town Wyoming, and also connect with good old town home American country values along the way?  More likely, someone is convinced that there's a fair market for Sarah Jessica Parker or Hugh Grant ""comedies"" and it doesn't matter whether they're any good.  I've seen a few of these ""fish out of water"" comedies about couples who reconnect when they (temporarily) lose everything, and this one has to be by far the worst.  Chock full 'o cliches and hamfisted delivery of life's lessons, it was painful to watch.  Like the moment when Sarah Jessica Parker's character  is searching for marriage advice from the reticent Sam Elliot, and misconstrues his advice about how to milk a cow as profound psychological insight.  Then, just to make sure the audience gets it, Parker's character points out that the advice is truly profound, and then spells out literally how what he said applies to her situation (something about breaking it to your spouse gently when you've cheated on them), and Elliot explains that he was really talking about the cow (something about pulling softly on the cow's teat so it doesn't kick you), but that he guesses you could take it both ways -- this film is a far cry from the screwball ""comedies of remarriage"" from classic Hollywood days when the writers expected their audiences to catch the puns and understand the double-entendres.  By the way, I don't begrudge Elliot taking this role, since he's sadly underused, and his character is one of the few things that makes this film semi-palatable.  Of course, nearly every little nugget of wisdom he utters in his gruff and sardonic manner turns out sounding profound, and has the merit of sounding smarter than almost anything said by the leading couple.  The worse thing was, this comedy just didn't manage to be funny.  For all they tried to milk comedy out of the incongruities of city folk in the country -- Hugh Grant gets his eyes sprayed by bear repellent ... twice!!!! -- I'd seen funnier variations of all of it many times before.It's not just the bad writing, but I have to say Sarah Jessica Parker and Hugh Grant are pretty annoying to watch here.  They aren't acting, but pretty much just playing more incompetent and more insecure versions of the usual characters they play in just about everything they're in.  I've never much liked them in anything -- though Hugh Grant managed to play a few decent roles (e.g.Four Weddings and a Funeraland, maybe,Bridget Jones's Diary) before he became a stereotype of himself (and then, maybe, one more inAbout a Boy); and though I'm no fan, Sarah Jessica Parker managed to fit well enough in her role in the Sex and the City series -- but I can say in all honesty that I've never seen them much worse.  I'm pretty sure, at least, that Hugh Grant can't possibly be proud of what he accomplished with this role since he seems hardly to believe half of the sappy things he says, and seems genuinely embarrassed by the self-deprecating antics he has to go through this time around.  I don't usually write reviews of films I hate, since I'd much prefer to spread the word about under-appreciated but excellent indies and international films; in this case, after renting it with my wife I thought it was the least I could do to warn others against wasting two precious hours of their lives.",1,I wish I'd never heard about the Morgans,1269129600,"03 21, 2010",2010,4809,"[""'m"",

If do decide to what this updated version, let me set your expectations so that you will not be dissapointed. A couple, Sarah Jessica Parker and Hugh Grant, on the verge of divorce, witness a murder thus forcing them to go into the witness protection program. In the Tim Allen Kirsty Alley version they are running  from the IRS. Tim and Kirsty hide  in Amish country; Hugh and Jessica flee to Wyoming instead. In Ray Wyoming, the pair meet Sam Elliot, a Marshal and Mary Steenburgen, his wife; as the two Marshals who will watch over the fighting couple. Parker plays the role rather blandly. As the movie slowly progresses, my wife and I wished for the original version. Hugh Grant, on the other hand, playing the penitant husband, a man who cheated on his wife; plays the part with some conviction. I believe Hugh is sincere in this part, probably due to the real-life experience that he brought to the each scene.I don't have any issues with remakes or even re-imaginings of a movie. However, if the remake does not build on the characters or the plot of the original, giving the audience more the second time around, I see this remake as a waste of time. I watched this movie with my teen-aged kids, and they laughed at all the correct places. Why not, this story line has worked before. The laughed when Hugh Grant deals with a large brown bear. The laughed during the horse riding sequence when Sara is chasing her horse - cute.

The fashion supplement (apparently a staple for any SJP film) was forgettable, and if you actually watch all of the supplements (and how Hugh Grant speaks of the industry) you have a fair idea how the commentary went. The Movie IQ was the standard IMDB on screen. The only supplement worth watching is the few minute bear extra - the bear had the best acting in the film and appeared to have more fun than the actors did.Region coded A/B/C. It will provide some light entertainment as a rental, but really a skipper, even for die hard Sam Elliott fans like me. 1.5 for the film, 1.5 for the clarity and supplements.",3,"I agree that this was unfunny, and the BD did little to help",1268611200,"03 15, 2010",2010,1762,"['really', 'wanted', 'be', 'sleeper', 'rental', 'customers', 'now', 'understand', 'why', 'tanked', 'theaters', 'then', 'put', 'DVD', 'six', 'weeks', 'end', 'result', 'was', 'irritating', 'unfunny', 'corny', 'left', 'hopefully', 'left', 'having', 'outstanding', 'BD', 'maybe', 'pump', 'up', 'not', 'really.Admittedly', 'clarity', 'was', 'solid', 'New', 'Mexico', 'countryside', 'yes', 'chose', 'snub', 'Wyoming', 'where', 'place', 'sound', 'was', 'hit', 'miss', 'few', 'falters', 'DTS', 'soundtrack', 'scenes', 'revealed', 'cabin', 'set', 'be', 'fake', 'driving', 'scene', 'was', 'painfully', 'obvious', 'set', 'flubs', 'made', 'sense', 'supplements', 'are', 'thorough', 'HD', 'typical', 'Sony', 'release', 'usually', 'list', 'one', 'one', 'were', 'most', 'self-serving', 'extras', 'have', 'ever', 'come', 'do', 'not', 'deserve', 'listing.The', 'first', 'one', 'avoid', 'actually', 'screened', 'volume', 'customers', 'was', 'overwhelmingly', 'voted', 'barf', 'material', 'Stars', 'DYHATM', 'person', 'actually', 'sat', 'even', 'great', 'Same', 'Elliott', 'brag', 'what', 'seemed', 'eternity', 'how', 'wonderful', 'amazing', 'everyone', 'repeatedly', 'then', 'more', 'fashion', 'supplement', 'apparently', 'staple', 'SJP', 'film', 'was', 'forgettable', 'actually', 'watch', 'supplements', 'how', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'speaks', 'industry', 'have', 'fair', 'idea', 'how', 'commentary', 'went', 'Movie', 'IQ', 'was', 'standard', 'IMDB', 'screen', 'only', 'supplement', 'watching', 'few', 'minute', 'bear', 'extra', 'bear', 'had', 'best', 'acting', 'film', 'appeared', 'have', 'more', 'fun', 'actors', 'did.Region', 'coded', 'A/B/C', 'will', 'provide', 'light', 'entertainment', 'rental', 'really', 'skipper', 'even', 'die', 'hard', 'Sam', 'Elliott', 'fans', '1.5', 'film', '1.5', 'clarity', 'supplements']",Did You Hear About the Morgans?

In this film, Hugh Grant is paired with Sarah Jessica Parker in perhaps the worst pairing since Vanilla Ice and Naomi Campbell in Cool As Ice. They play a fashionably separated, New York City power couple, who are forced into witness protection after witnessing a murder. These two city folks are put in the care of an elderly U.S. Marshall and his wife, in the middle of nowhere Montana. Let the fun times begin! Didn't Tim Allen and Kirstie Alley do this a decade earlier in Amish country? At least For Richer or Poorer could get a few cheap laughs here and there, but not the Morgans. The Morgans have no chemistry what-so-ever and their film is painfully slow and predictable. Hugh Grant is usually funny, but in this film, every attempt at humor is snuffed out by Sarah Jessica Parker, who has no idea what she's doing. Parker is just one of these people who was lucky enough to find her perfect role and she was amazing in it, but everything I've seen her in since Sex & The City has been awful! Did You Hear About The Morgans has been done, more than once, and if you watch this movie and can't tell what's going to happen, twenty minutes a head of time, then you haven't seen too many movies.

Even the character played by Hugh Grant, usually a very reliable actor, is not as charming as he should be, and as to the Razzie-nominated Sarah Jessica Parker's irritating character, I rooted for the villain.This is the third time Hugh Grant has collaborated with director Marc Lawrence. The first was ""Two Weeks Notice"" and the second ""Music and Lyrics."" They may not be the greatest film in the world, but at least the latter is much more delightful than ""Morgans,"" thanks to the considerable chemistry between Hugh Grant and Drew Barrymore.
