However, in ""The Squid and the Whale,"" freedom is showcased with a family where everyone is doing (mostly) what he or she wants, and everyone is miserable.  Reeling on separation and an inevitable divorce, the father (Jeff Daniels) and the mother (Laura Linney) are writers. (The father's work is waning, so he works as a professor.)  In this household, the separation leaves two boys, an older adolescent, Walt (Jesse Eisenberg) and a coming-of-age adolescent, Frank (Owen Kline) with the fallout, each working out his own loyalties and feelings. The arrangement of joint-custody initially works well for the parents, but leaves the boys hurt and confused.  The angst of their emotions comes out in vivid ways:  The older boy enters a talent contest stealing a Pink Floyd song; the younger boy leaves personal fluids smeared on library shelves.  (All of the poignant parent-to-school-official scenes show the father's denial and cluelessness.)  The parents act out their whims and give the boys little sense of stability--in their lives and in their relationships.  Walt seems to see nothing wrong with his plagiarism and is deluded despite his understandable desire to have a meaningful relationship with his girlfriend.Nevertheless, the movie offers glimmers of hope.  The music, especially ""Hey You"" by Pink Floyd and a Lou Reed song from his ""Street Hassle"" album couldn't be topped for evoking feelings of alienation and loneliness, yet they provide, like the movie itself, healing beauty for the characters and viewers.  The acting is genuine and natural, and the story is presented in a haunting way.  It is a disturbing film with some thoughtful observations about holding on to the best of what life offers no matter what is handed to you.",4,Moby Movie,1145664000,"04 22, 2006",2006,1780,"['Freedom', 'loved', 'desired', 'However', 'Squid', 'Whale', 'freedom', 'showcased', 'family', 'where', 'everyone', 'doing', 'mostly', 'what', 'everyone', 'miserable', 'Reeling', 'separation', 'inevitable', 'divorce', 'father', 'Jeff', 'Daniels', 'mother', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'are', 'writers', 'father', 'work', 'waning', 'professor', 'household', 'separation', 'two', 'boys', 'older', 'adolescent', 'Walt', 'Jesse', 'Eisenberg', 'coming-of-age', 'adolescent', 'Frank', 'Owen', 'Kline', 'fallout', 'working', 'out', 'own', 'loyalties', 'feelings', 'arrangement', 'joint-custody', 'initially', 'well', 'parents', 'boys', 'hurt', 'confused', 'angst', 'emotions', 'out', 'vivid', 'ways', 'older', 'boy', 'talent', 'contest', 'stealing', 'Pink', 'Floyd', 'song', 'younger', 'boy', 'personal', 'fluids', 'smeared', 'library', 'shelves', 'poignant', 'parent-to-school-official', 'scenes', 'show', 'father', 'denial', 'cluelessness', 'parents', 'act', 'out', 'whims', 'give', 'boys', 'little', 'sense', 'stability', 'lives', 'relationships', 'Walt', 'see', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'plagiarism', 'deluded', 'understandable', 'desire', 'have', 'meaningful', 'relationship', 'girlfriend.Nevertheless', 'movie', 'glimmers', 'hope', 'music', 'especially', 'Hey', 'Pink', 'Floyd', 'Lou', 'Reed', 'song', 'Street', 'Hassle', 'album', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'topped', 'evoking', 'feelings', 'alienation', 'loneliness', 'yet', 'provide', 'movie', 'healing', 'beauty', 'characters', 'viewers', 'acting', 'genuine', 'natural', 'story', 'presented', 'haunting', 'way', 'disturbing', 'film', 'thoughtful', 'observations', 'holding', 'best', 'what', 'life', 'matter', 'what', 'handed']",N/A
962165,A2EEUQ81DTY7G3,B000CS464G,A Customer,"[5, 8]","Divorce is never easy, especially when there are kids involved. The bitterness, anger and frustration can spill over, upsetting lives for years to come. The couple in Noah Baumbach's outstanding The Squid and the Whale are trying desperately to navigate these treacherous waters, doing what they think is right, but ending up wallowing in a kind of post-relationship, tension-fuelled angst. When they're not arguing over who gets the cat and whose books are on the shelf, they're trying to juggle seeing the kids on alternative nights.Bernard Berkman (an outstanding Jeff Daniels) is a washed-up novelist, a kind of left-wing snobbish intellectual who teaches writing at Brooklyn College and telegraphs his insecurity by spouting reductionist views on literary culture. On the surface, his wife Joan (Laura Linney) is the devoted wife and mother, but her career as a novelist has just taken off and she's been leaving clues to her infidelities all over their Park Slope home.In between their battles are the kids, 16-year-old Walt (Jesse Eisenberg) and 12-year-old Frank (Owen Kline), are caught in the middle, taking sides without always knowing it and imitating their embattled parents in subtle and often angry ways. Bernard is the centerpiece of the story, he's a complicated, intense and frustrated man, jealous of his wife's success, and shields his disappointments with a type of holier than thou pride. He calls less educated people philistines, and looks down on those who don't like good books and interesting movies.Walt impetuously worships his dad and when his father tells him about his mother's affairs, he immediately blames his mom for the failed marriage. He turns into a type of miniature Bernard; lying to his new girlfriend and telling everyone he wrote a Pink Floyd song. Frank, meanwhile, embarks on his own campaign of self-destructive behavior, yet he has the intelligibility to see that Bernard is ultimately a fraud.As Joan, Linney is in fine form as usual and expertly handles a role that is at first more complex than it seems. A caring mother who calls her sons ""chicken"" and ""pickle,"" Joan can't help coming off as more centered than her husband and more certain of her actions, and what she wants out of life. Her new found artistic inclinations have helped her find sides of herself that she didn't know existed; she's also remarkably selfish, often putting her own romantic needs before the welfare of her two boys. This makes her more of a problematic parent than we initially realize.The Squid and the Whale is only about eighty minutes long, but it's one of those rare movies that could have gone on for much longer, and in the process it really packs and emotional wallop. Baumbach manages to say it all in such brief screen time, encapsulating the sentiment and the unsparing honesty, and making us laugh in the midst of tragedy.These relationships are truly multi-faceted; most of them emotionally dangerous, and you can feel the maelstrom of pent-up resentment lingering over the action. The world of divorce is difficult to navigate; yet gradually, sometimes horrifyingly, and somehow comically, these four people move into their new roles. The film doesn't offer any solutions to heartbreak of breakups, but the film is cut and shot in a way that emphasizes the darkly comic contours of miscommunication and reminds us of the humanity lying beneath the surface of families like the Berkmans.

On the contrary, watching the Nantucket whale slaughters would have been more pleasant.  If this movie has any value at all, which is questionable, it's as a primer on everything divorcing parents should desperately avoid doing unless they're determined to cripple their children for life.Characters in this movie fall into three categories; hopelessly narcissistic adult children, child victims being tortured by the recklessness and self-indulgence of parents, and sexual playthings.  The entire effort has a halo of implausibility to it.  Have you ever noticed that in precious art house films of this stripe people often have completely ridiculous, painfully intellectual professions?  Our principals here are among the millions of Americans making a living as novelists and New Yorker essayists.  Look elsewhere, especially in Woody Allen pictures, and see how many photojournalists, fashion designers, performance artists, painters, and people with no visible means of support at all you find - inevitably living in terminally chic, lovingly appointed brownstones.  Picture it, and you are well inside the world of The Squid & The Whale, where Bernard (Jeff Daniels) fondly drops names like Norman Mailer and George Plimpton the way you or I might drop a brick.Bernard is so completely vain and obnoxious that he has no redeeming qualities at all, which is bad, because he is the film's central character.  Wife Joan is equally two-dimensional.  While Laura Linney is a consistently splendid actress, her Joan lacks any maternal skill and is staggeringly inappropriate in what she reveals to her children.  The showcase performance is by Jesse Eisenberg, convincing as a boy who mimics his father with pathetic devotion and is paying the price.  Eisenberg's Walt is developing psychological problems deep enough to keep him in therapy for life, watching his public flensing is torture.That writer-director Noah Baumbach co-wrote The Life Aquatic helps explain this movie's unfunny pointlessness, but Wes Anderson, co-producer, should have known better.

The brilliant intertwining of the different character's stories is well done and gives an overall ""realistic"" atmosphere that seems so hard to achieve in film (including documentaries).  The fluid transitions of humor, jealousy, fantasy, forgiveness, and growth flesh out the story as a truly classic tragic comedy.Jeff Daniels and Laura Linney both do an amazing job of bringing out all the irony and contradictions of their characters.  Egocentric to the point of ridiculousness and desperately needing approval; they both push and pull at each-other and their children creating a very powerful ebb and flow of humor, hope and failure.  Because of this breakdown the children reflect, deny, and attempt to adjust to their parents anguish sometimes with painful results.The soundtrack is quirky and always fits in nicely with the story.  There's a good mix of well know musicians like Lou Reed and Pink Floyd with top notch but relatively unknown musicians like Pentangle's Bert Jansch or The Feelies.  I like that the movie takes place in the early 80's but the filmmaker didn't go with obvious choices or with music just from that time.What really shines the most in this movie is the writing.

962171,A3TXO9NUIJ4G0X,B000CS464G,Angela,"[0, 0]","The Squid and the Whale is a tragedy dressed up as a comedy. You spend much of the film laughing at this fractured family and their members' numerous personal disasters, but, in the end, that feeling of bittersweet humanity weighs. It's a gorgeous, pitch perfect film.Set in 1980s Brooklyn, we follow the fraying Berkmans: pater familias is Bernard (Jeff Daniels on a tour de force), an overbearing, self-aggrandizing snob and former novelist star. His wife is Joan (Laura Linney), ever-patient but reaching the end of her tether and realizing her own writerly talents, her own freedoms. They have two sons: the older Walt (Jesse Eisenberg), insecure and turning into a walking mimic of Bernard, and younger Frank (Owen Kline, son of Kevin), a sensitive turtle- and tennis-lover. Early in the film, the parents announce: they're getting a divorce. Joint custody. Frank dissolves into tears. Walt mimics the adults and calmly asks who will take care of the cat.The film's tone is one of gently mocking humor, a sort of infinitely sensitive satire. While Bernard could easily fall into the trap of being the film's villain, he is just as wounded as the others. There is no malice, so much as bumbling, desperate attempts to maintain an uneasy peace amidst all these hurting people. Walt passes off a Pink Floyd song as his own, and acts arrogantly towards his well-meaning girlfriend (Halley Feiffer). In one of the film's simultaneously most horrifying, funny and sad sequences, younger brother Frank discovers alcohol and his sexuality. Bernard takes in one of his writing students, Lili (Anna Paquin), as a boarder - to disastrous effect.The script is intelligent, with subtle revelations and much between the lines. The sparring between these family members feels very real, with old wounds resurfacing in fresh attacks, with battle lines drawn along the film's opening tennis match (Mom and Frank vs. Dad and Walt). The final revelation - that we have to accept our scary, imperfect parents, the squids and the whales who beget us - is forgiving and true.While Billy Baldwin as Ivan, Frank's tennis coach, threatens to turn into a caricature, and Anna Paquin acts as little more than a vamp, the nuclear family is as real as ever. This is a biographical film, and writer/director Noah Baumbach treats his (highly personal) subject with delicacy, intelligence and a fair degree of objectivity. Everyone is imperfect (we even wondered which brother Noah was, as both are pretty damning), but they also have moments of grace. The performances, particularly Jeff Daniels (who would then be imitated, to much lesser effect, by Dennis Quaid in the comparatively pale knock-offSmart People) and Owen Kline, are amazing.

962172,A2582KMXLK2P06,B000CS464G,B. E Jackson,"[0, 0]","The Squid & the Whale is an excellent film but it takes a while to warm up to it.  In the beginning, your impression is probably going to be that of a picture perfect family with demandingly high expectations out of their kids- get good grades, study hard, pass your tests, have all your priorities straight, etc.  However after a divorce that ends on a note that's not the least bit realistic (most of the time divorces end in a bitter, unpleasant and unforgiveable way- not civil and constructive like the one we see here) the kids are forced to spend certain days out of the week with their mother and father.  The mother has the kids 3 days a week, the father 3 days a week... and every other Thursday the mother and father will alternate the kids.  Clever way of organizing the 7 days of the week!  This is when the storyline gets going.It's kind of hard to describe these characters.  Most of us can't relate to the parents in particular.  The best way to describe them is that they're abnormal in a way that's sort of hard to notice at first- it's a disguise.  They come across as loving caring parents in a sophisticated kind of way.  Not until the after affects of the divorce do we really see the parents fall apart.Throughout the film, the mother and father like to spend time with their kids by playing tennis, pinball and attending talent shows.  While this is occurring, the mother and father are both dating separate people.  The mother's dating a man who's sort of lazy and unintelligent, and the father's dating a much younger woman.  A small complaint is that neither the boyfriend or girlfriend ever play a crucial part.  They are basically just *there* for a spot on a few occasions.Meanwhile the oldest son is discovering the difficulties of relationships and especially sex.  This leads to a few hilarious and embarrassing scenes involving a girlfriend of his.  One thing that threw me off for a while is when the oldest son is telling everyone he wrote this song called ""Hey You"" (the Pink Floyd tune).  When the talent show comes later on, he tells the audience the same thing and people seem to believe him.  We find out later (when in the bedroom with another girl) that it was just a trick and that he's lucky he didn't get caught.The younger son tends to blurt out offensive things every once in a while, especially when he calls his mother ugly while they're both standing in front of a mirror.  The surprising moment is when he loses a pinball match and blurts out the mother of all swear words and his father doesn't seem to care.  Perhaps this is what happens when parents get divorced- they stop caring.  The oldest song does the same thing when his father is lying in a hospital bed and hurts his father's feelings by saying he's not going to visit him on a certain day.Overall, the Squid & the Whale is a funny film that's more like a drama, but not in the usual sense.  You have to really pay attention to the storyline and the jokes will seem funnier.",4,who's the squid and who's the whale?,1359244800,"01 27, 2013",2013,2988,"['Squid', 'Whale', 'excellent', 'film', 'while', 'warm', 'up', 'beginning', 'impression', 'probably', 'going', 'be', 'picture', 'perfect', 'family', 'demandingly', 'high', 'expectations', 'kids-', 'get', 'good', 'grades', 'study', 'hard', 'pass', 'tests', 'have', 'priorities', 'straight', 'etc', 'However', 'divorce', 'note', 'not', 'least', 'bit', 'realistic', 'most', 'time', 'divorces', 'end', 'bitter', 'unpleasant', 'unforgiveable', 'way-', 'not', 'civil', 'constructive', 'one', 'see', 'here', 'kids', 'are', 'forced', 'spend', 'certain', 'days', 'week', 'mother', 'father', 'mother', 'kids', '3', 'days', 'week', 'father', '3', 'days', 'week', 'other', 'Thursday', 'mother', 'father', 'will', 'alternate', 'kids', 'Clever', 'way', 'organizing', '7', 'days', 'week', 'when', 'storyline', 'going.It', 'kind', 'hard', 'describe', 'characters', 'Most', 'ca', ""n't"", 'relate', 'parents', 'particular', 'best', 'way', 'describe', ""'re"", 'abnormal', 'way', 'sort', 'hard', 'notice', 'first-', 'disguise', 'come', 'loving', 'caring', 'parents', 'sophisticated', 'kind', 'way', 'Not', 'affects', 'divorce', 'do', 'really', 'see', 'parents', 'fall', 'film', 'mother', 'father', 'spend', 'time', 'kids', 'playing', 'tennis', 'pinball', 'attending', 'talent', 'shows', 'occurring', 'mother', 'father', 'are', 'dating', 'separate', 'people', 'mother', 'dating', 'man', 'who', 'sort', 'lazy', 'unintelligent', 'father', 'dating', 'much', 'younger', 'woman', 'small', 'complaint', 'boyfriend', 'girlfriend', 'ever', 'play', 'crucial', 'part', 'are', 'basically', 'just', '*there*', 'spot', 'few', 'oldest', 'son', 'discovering', 'difficulties', 'relationships', 'especially', 'sex', 'few', 'hilarious', 'embarrassing', 'scenes', 'involving', 'girlfriend', 'One', 'thing', 'threw', 'off', 'while', 'when', 'oldest', 'son', 'telling', 'everyone', 'wrote', 'song', 'called', 'Hey', 'Pink', 'Floyd', 'tune', 'When', 'talent', 'show', 'later', 'audience', 'same', 'thing', 'people', 'seem', 'believe', 'find', 'out', 'later', 'when', 'bedroom', 'girl', 'was', 'just', 'trick', 'lucky', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'caught.The', 'younger', 'son', 'blurt', 'out', 'offensive', 'things', 'once', 'while', 'especially', 'when', 'mother', 'ugly', ""'re"", 'standing', 'front', 'mirror', 'surprising', 'moment', 'when', 'pinball', 'match', 'out', 'mother', 'swear', 'words', 'father', ""n't"", 'seem', 'care', 'Perhaps', 'what', 'when', 'parents', 'get', 'divorced-', 'stop', 'caring', 'oldest', 'song', 'same', 'thing', 'when', 'father', 'lying', 'hospital', 'bed', 'father', 'feelings', 'saying', 'not', 'going', 'visit', 'certain', 'day.Overall', 'Squid', 'Whale', 'funny', 'film', 'more', 'drama', 'not', 'usual', 'sense', 'have', 'really', 'pay', 'attention', 'storyline', 'jokes', 'will', 'seem', 'funnier']",N/A

It also is yet another testament to the talent of Noah Baumbach. It belongs in the same pantheon of magnificence as does Kicking and Screaming. Baumbach as auteur succeeds in creating an immediate experience for his viewers and embroils us in his very personal depiction of the terminal point in a marriage...along with the hell that we know to be divorce. Vividly we witness its destructive impact in the spiraling effects upon the couples' promising children. The film evidences the way in which childhood pain seldom dissipates even with the passage of decades.All of the performances are superlative here, but Jesse Eisenberg's as Walt Berkman was nothing short of amazing. He engages us from the onset and we find it practically impossible to take our eyes off him. Walt's alienation from his liberated mother is very common but politically incorrect to discuss in the present age. The sexual revolution can be forced down the throats of adults and adults can be cowed into ""tolerating"" it and keeping silent, but with children it's another story. A mother can tell her boy that her sexual infidelities are an attempt to find herself or to make new spiritual connections, but boys don't understand those types of things. Treachery and dishonor, however, need no explanation. Ms. Berkman tells Walt, ""You think you hate me but I know you don't,"" but she is very wrong. Painfully wrong. In this way the child is the father to the man. The boy can see through the clouds and smoke our society bellows and obtain a meaningful glimpse of the suppressed truth beyond.The youngest brother, Frank, is thoroughly traumatized by the divorce and his ongoing emotional disturbance is but another illustration of the way in which children vicariously experience parental strife as they are the ultimate mirrors of behavior. The Squid and the Whale reveals veritas with grace, sympathy, and eloquence.

The studio probably had to shell out a lot of cash for Jeff Daniels, so perhaps there was no money left to create a consistent decade-appropriate setting.  It was a glaring distraction during much of the film.Discontinuity is the least of this movie's problems, however.  It has a boy who looks no older than 11 cuss constantly and engage in sick and perverse behaviors too disgusting to mention here.  Unfortunately, the movie's presentation of this troubled boy is gratuitous, seemingly intended for a darkly comical take on his unsettling behaviors.  The subject of sexual abuse is never even brought up in the film, even though the kid seems to be exhibiting behaviors consistent with it.  Every character in this movie is rotten in their own way.  The attempt at a dramatic ending was pretentious and pointless, since it resolved nothing for this family of losers, whom I had stopped caring about anyway. The only good thing about this movie is the acting.  It kept me watching the film long after I should have left the theater.A major plot element involves the teenager borrowing Pink Floyd lyrics and performing them in a talent show as if they were his own, winning an award for his efforts from his credulous school.  No one at the time of the performance knew it was Pink Floyd?  I had a hard enough time believing that the parents, steeped in literary references, were totally clueless.  I surely didn't believe an entire audience would be.  Pink Floyd was one of the biggest bands of the 70s and 80s.  The Pink Floyd plot contrivance was just one in ""Squid"" that evidenced bad writing.I am tired of all these movies about losers and dysfunctionality.  Critics praise them because they seem ""real"".  The idea of something noble or grand seems ridiculous to them and to Hollywood, which doesn't make grand movies anymore.  Thankfully, most of the great movies from the era of great moviemaking (the 30s-40s) are now on DVD.So why spend your money on cynical, life-debasing trash like this?  Critics almost universally praise it, but that says more about them and the pseudo-intellectual post-modern liberal elitist culture in which they live than it does the merits of adding ""Squid"" to your DVD collection.",2,Another movie about losers...,1140480000,"02 21, 2006",2006,2328,"['fact', 'cars', '90s', '2000s', 'fill', 'streets', 'movie', 'supposedly', 'set', '80s', 'studio', 'probably', 'had', 'shell', 'out', 'lot', 'cash', 'Jeff', 'Daniels', 'so', 'perhaps', 'was', 'money', 'left', 'create', 'consistent', 'decade-appropriate', 'setting', 'was', 'glaring', 'distraction', 'much', 'film.Discontinuity', 'least', 'movie', 'problems', 'however', 'boy', 'who', 'older', '11', 'cuss', 'constantly', 'engage', 'sick', 'perverse', 'behaviors', 'too', 'disgusting', 'mention', 'here', 'Unfortunately', 'movie', 'presentation', 'troubled', 'boy', 'gratuitous', 'seemingly', 'intended', 'darkly', 'comical', 'take', 'unsettling', 'behaviors', 'subject', 'sexual', 'abuse', 'never', 'even', 'brought', 'up', 'film', 'even', 'kid', 'be', 'exhibiting', 'behaviors', 'consistent', 'character', 'movie', 'rotten', 'own', 'way', 'attempt', 'dramatic', 'ending', 'was', 'pretentious', 'pointless', 'resolved', 'nothing', 'family', 'losers', 'whom', 'had', 'stopped', 'caring', 'anyway', 'only', 'good', 'thing', 'movie', 'acting', 'kept', 'watching', 'film', 'long', 'should', 'have', 'left', 'theater.A', 'major', 'plot', 'element', 'teenager', 'borrowing', 'Pink', 'Floyd', 'lyrics', 'performing', 'talent', 'show', 'were', 'own', 'winning', 'award', 'efforts', 'credulous', 'school', 'one', 'time', 'performance', 'knew', 'was', 'Pink', 'Floyd', 'had', 'hard', 'enough', 'time', 'believing', 'parents', 'steeped', 'literary', 'references', 'were', 'totally', 'clueless', 'surely', 'did', ""n't"", 'believe', 'entire', 'audience', 'would', 'be', 'Pink', 'Floyd', 'was', 'one', 'biggest', 'bands', '70s', '80s', 'Pink', 'Floyd', 'plot', 'contrivance', 'was', 'just', 'one', 'Squid', 'evidenced', 'bad', 'writing.I', 'am', 'tired', 'movies', 'losers', 'dysfunctionality', 'Critics', 'praise', 'seem', 'real', 'idea', 'something', 'noble', 'grand', 'ridiculous', 'Hollywood', ""n't"", 'make', 'grand', 'movies', 'anymore', 'Thankfully', 'most', 'great', 'movies', 'era', 'great', 'moviemaking', '30s-40s', 'are', 'now', 'DVD.So', 'why', 'spend', 'money', 'cynical', 'life-debasing', 'trash', 'Critics', 'almost', 'universally', 'praise', 'more', 'pseudo-intellectual', 'post-modern', 'liberal', 'elitist', 'culture', 'live', 'merits', 'adding', 'Squid', 'DVD', 'collection']",N/A
962177,A2ATWKOFJXRRR1,B000CS464G,"B. Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[1, 6]","THE SQUID AND THE WHALE is quite difficult to give a negative review to because I felt it manhandled the parent/child relationship with some great child actors, but failed in every other aspect.Jeff Daniels stars as Bernard, a writer of minimal fame who's marriage is on the brink of implosion. We first meet Bernard and his dysfunctional family while they play tennis and quickly learn that his wife Joan (Laura Linney, The Exorcism of Emily Rose) is fed up with her husband's over-compensating ego related to his failed writing career. But the marriage has lasted nearly sixteen years and produced two children. The eldest, Walt (Jesse Eisenberg), is in high school and idolizes his father, so much so that he tries to be just as intellectual as his dad but can't quite reach the mark. At one point during a talent show he goes so far as to steal a new Pink Floyd song and play it off as his own, thus winning the grand prize. The younger brother, Frank (Owen Kline), is attached to his mother but also loves Walt, and the stress of the marriage's break-up and subsequent family breakdown leave him with embittered feelings toward everyone, including himself; he starts drinking beer and whiskey, and comparing his looks to his mother.It is the young boys who really pulled this movie up to a higher standing that it could ever hope to be and the script helped them out, making their portrayals relatively interesting to watch. For instance, as Walt discovers the truth about his father and his mother (how screwed up they both are) he has to come to terms with becoming his own man. It's a tough realization for anyone to come to and watching Walt battle his younger self only to be bucked back to reality by his new, older self is a great way of showing self actualization.Young Frank doesn't have that option, though. He's too young to know about such things and so acts out against the world around him. He drinks, curses like his father, tries to hate his mother, and ejaculates on library books as a show of defiance towards his parents' chosen professions (writing).So that's the good parts of this award winning flick. But let me tell you about the ""not-so-good"" parts ...The cameras used for filming are often handheld and although this can give a sense of interaction on the audiences part, it felt more wobbly than anything.The script, although interesting, didn't translate well to film. There's really no angst one feels for these characters, only a sense of impending depression for what awaits them (""Oh boy, another family dynamic movie with screwed up parents and children. Now where did I put my Prozac?"")And finally, the title of the film is THE SQUID AND THE WHALE. Titles are important to me; they give me a sense of what the film's going to be about, even if in relative terms. But this title is in reference to something that appeared to be thrown into the movie at the last minute. Now I realize that may not be the case, but that's how it felt. We never know what this squid and this whale are until three-fourths of the way through the film, as if it was supposed to tie it all up for us in a nice little psychological package.

To my dismay, TSATW is yet another sophomoric slice-of-lifer that watches like an R-rated afterschool special.  Selfish, unlikeable yuppie couple living in Brooklyn in the mid-eighties decide to divorce, then proceed alternately to smother, ignore, manipulate and emotionally blackmail their two teenage boys.  Plot is conventional, even substandard (who in 1986 wouldn't know a common Pink Floyd song when he heard it?).  Whining and literary pretentiousness abound; distasteful pre- and post-pubescent sexuality and random incomplete thoughts are explored tiresomely.  The soundtrack is hippy-kitsch (my brutha)-- conspicuous, distracting and out of place.

There are many like him (mostly male) within college faculties, and it's easier to see the faults of the Daniels character. Laura Linney's character's faults can slip by many people; they're not as apparent at first. This makes her character all the more intriguing. I had some trouble with the young boy's conduct.

Though it's only a tennis match, it's more than that. The parents will split, the two brothers will take sides, and the parents will use them both as proxies, or better yet, as pawns in their battle, with joint custody providing the pretext. As the tagline clearly states: ""Joint Custody Blows.""Walter Berkman (Jesse Eisenberg) takes his father's side, especially when he learns that it was mom who had an affair. But maybe he should have taken a closer look at just who his father is before taking on so much of his attitudes and world view. His father, Bernard Berkman (Jeff Daniels), is a literature professor who thinks he is smarter than the average bear. The philistines, by whom he means everybody else, do not appreciate good books and interesting films. Meanwhile, he is totally out of touch with his own and his family's true feelings, as well as unfamiliar with the oeuvre of Roger Waters and Pink Floyd. Walter would do well to form his own opinions instead of merely serving as his dad's echo chamber:-----------Sophie Greenberg: Yeah. I mean, it's gross when he turns into the bug, but I love how matter of fact everything is.Walter Berkman: Yeah, it's very Kafkaesque.Sophie Greenberg: [She looks at him oddly. She laughs] Cause it's written by Franz Kafka.Walter Berkman: Right. I mean, clearly.===================Not to say that Professor Berkman doesn't know his literature, or even that his opinion of the relative merits of F. Scott Fitzgerald's ""Tender is the Night"" compared to ""The Great Gatsby"" is incorrect; but there is a disconnect when he tries to apply the lessons of literature to real life. He is like Mr. Jones in Bob Dylan's ""Ballad of a Thin Man.""You've been with the professorsAnd they've all liked your looksWith great lawyers you haveDiscussed lepers and crooksYou've been through all ofF. Scott Fitzgerald's booksYou're very well readIt's well knownBecause something is happening hereBut you don't know what it isDo you, Mister Jones?Sure, he has published a novel, but it bugs him when all he is getting lately is rejection letters, while his wife Joan Berkman (Laura Linney) is getting her novel published, and they're printing excerpts in The New Yorker. And why can't he beat Ivan (William Baldwin), the tennis pro, when he is smarter, has studied the greats of tennis extensively, and Ivan is nothing but a philistine who goes around calling everyone ""brother"" with an Ebonics inflection?---------------Frank Berkman: What's a philistine?Bernard Berkman: It's a guy who doesn't care about books and interesting films and things.Bernard Berkman: Your mother's brother Ned is also a philistine.Frank Berkman: Then I'm a philistine.Bernard Berkman: No, you're interested in books and things.==============================This film reminds me a lot of ""Smart People"" and the professor played by Dennis Quaid is a lot like Professor Bernard Berkman. Both professors are taken aback when it is another family member, not them, who gets published in The New Yorker. Still I like ""The Squid and the Whale"" better because ""Smart People"" plays more like a conventional Romantic Comedy while TSATW unfolds with the quirky cadences of real life.Maybe you are wondering what the significance of the title is, but that question is addressed, just watch the movie. A few other questions need to be answered immediately.Q: How ironic is it to have Jeff Daniels, who was Dumb to Jim Carrey's Dumber in ""Dumb and Dumber"" playing a professor who thinks he's smarter than everyone?A: Very ironic, if you'll allow a rather more fluid definition of irony than the one given by Ethan Hawke in ""Reality Bites.""Q: Do you ever confuse Jeff Daniels with Dave Coulier (pronounced Cool-yay), who played Joseph 'Joey' Gladstone in 193 episodes of ""Full House"" from 1987 to 1995?A: I used to confuse them; but they are not the same guy. ""You Oughta Know"" that it was Coulier who was Mr. Duplicity in the song by Alanis Morissette; and they met at a celebrity hockey game.Q: Who is Owen Kline? I keep getting him mixed up with Clive Owen. And it was hard enough keeping him and Owen Wilson straight.A: I have the same problem; but new comer Owen Kline is the son of Kevin Kline and Phoebe Cates. He has inherited a tremendous amount of talent from both parents. In ""The Squid and the Whale"" he plays the younger brother, Frank Berkman.Q: What is up with Walter? Why is he so conflicted about his girlfriend, Sophie Greenberg (Halley Feiffer)?A: In case you haven't noticed, she clearly resembles his mother, Joan Berkman (Laura Linney), and that clearly exacerbates his already severe Oedipus complex.Q: When Walter Berkman is discussing Franz Kafka's story ""The Metamorphosis"" with Sophie Greenberg, he calls it Kafka-esque. Apart from the redundancy, that rang a bell. Where have I heard that word before?A: In Woody Allen's 1977 film, ""Annie Hall"" the following exchange takes place:Pam: Sex with you is really a Kafka-esque experience.Alvy Singer: Oh. Thank you.Pam: I mean that as a compliment.Q: If Diane Keaton was Annie Hall, then who was Pam?A: Pam was played by Shelley Duvall.Q: Didn't Annie Hall win a ton of Oscars, very unusual for a comedy?A: Yes, it won for best picture, best screenplay, best director, and Diane Keaton won best actress. Woody Allen was also nominated for best actor.Q: The acting in ""The Squid and the Whale"" is so good, have any of these people ever won an Oscar?A: Though Daniels no doubt deserves one for ""Dumb and Dumber;"" as does Baldwin for ""Sliver"" and ""Fair Game;"" and Linney has been nominated for three Oscars; only Anna Paquin has won so far, for ""The Piano.""Q: Anna Paquin? Didn't she play Jeff Daniels' daughter in ""Fly Away Home?"" Now she is his love interest. How long ago was that?A: ""Fly Away Home"" was released in 1996, and then here she is in 2005 with the whale from ""The Squid and the Whale.""Q: That seems like it would make filming their scenes pretty awkward. How did they get through it?A: Jeff Daniels has said that they tried not to think about, you know... geese.Q: When was Anna Paquin born?A: On the 24th of July in 1982, in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.Q: Did ""The Squid and the Whale"" win any Oscars in other categories?A: No, but writer/director Noah Baumbach was nominated for his script, which is based on his and his brother's own experiences going through their parent's divorce.Q: ""The Squid and the Whale"" is rather quirky, but also realistic. What would you say is Noah Baumbach's quirkiest work?A: That would have to be 2004's ""The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou"" which he wrote along with the film's director, Wes Anderson.Q: Wasn't Owen Kline in that one? Or was it Clive Owen?A: No, it was Owen Wilson.Q: Are you sure?A: Positive. Owen Wilson is a frequent collaborator with Wes Anderson, as is Noah Baumbach, but for some reason only Owen Kline was in this one.Q: You are so smart. Are you sure you aren't a philistine?A: Positive.Q: How do you know so much?A: I use Internet Movie Database (IMDB dot com) and the online collaborative encyclopedia, wikipedia (wikipedia dot org) to verify all my facts.The Savages(2007) ....

You know what I mean: the ""almost comedy,"" the ""quirky drama,"" the ""unbelieveable reality."" Noah Baumbach's The Squid and the Whale is a good example of this genre. It's kind of like that other nearly mainstream movie of his,The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou - Criterion Collection (2-Disc Special Edition). This one is more realistic than The Life Aquatic, but it has that same kind of quirkiness. The characters are so entrenched in their stereotypes that they're almost humorous.Jeff Daniels (who is amazing in this film) is the stereotypical English professor who pontificates on every subject as if he has the be-all-end-all opinion on everything. Meanwhile, his wife, the nice one, is just as messed up. And the kids, well, they are the epitome of dysfunction. Their role models--their parents--and incapable or relating on any level other than stupidity, and so they can't make competent decisions. The father gives the older one advice such as ""Sleep with her and see what it's like. Then move on."" (I'm paraphrasing here.) And the younger one can't decide who he is, except that he knows he's only 12 going on 21.Here, the drama is more important than the comedy, and I don't think I laughed at all, but it's still that kind of movie.

He co-wrote ""The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou,"" directed 1995's post-collegiate comedy ""Kicking and Screaming"" and is also the son of Village Voice film critic Georgia Brown and novelist and critic Jonathan Baumbach. Reportedly, the movie is based on his own experiences growing up and, while the family portrait is at times harsh, it still feels loving and real.Daniels, wearing an incredibly itchy-looking beard that resembles streaked steel wool, somehow makes the jerky Bernard both thoroughly insufferable but also very funny (he's simply too well-read and cultured to bother with such concepts as humility and compassion). Linney's Joan is pragmatic, but also mostly sympathetic. Eisenberg perfectly conveys the anxiety of a young man trying to find the path to adulthood while the adults in his life seem to be heading in the opposite direction. And Owen Kline, actor Kevin Kline's 14-year-old son (who actually looks a good deal younger than his age) deftly handles some of the film's more cringe-inducing moments.All of this adds up to a strange combination of elements. Despite its downbeat subject matter, ""Squid"" is actually more comedy than drama; yet despite its almost childlike title, it's a frank and knowing look at the ways divorce affects children. Essentially, though, this is a kids' movie for grown-ups, a little like a toned-down version of ""The Royal Tenenbaums,"" crossed with the angst, anger and ickiness of a John Irving novel.Like Eisenberg's character, I was 16 in 1986 and while there are some anachronisms here and there (modern soap dispensers, lots of post-86 cars and an entrance to the American Museum of Natural History that wasn't built until 2000 -- a forgivable side effect of the film's microscopic budget), the tone feels dead on. Kids making out to the Cars' ""Drive,"" Burger King glasses and just the general vibe of the decor all hit the mark. Plus, as a slightly unsuspecting young person who also saw ""Blue Velvet"" in a theater, I literally howled at ""Squid""'s nod to David Lynch's classic.

Walt's parents, Bernard and Joan, are both writer-snobs, a trait that does not serve their family well after they separate, especially because Joan's career is flourishing and Bernard's is tanking. After a family meeting when they tell Walt and his younger brother Frank that they are separating, the film tracks how everyone takes sides, plays favorites, blames, and manipulates. Fear and insecurity stalk everyone. Whose night is it to take the cat? Joint custody is hell. It's her obligation to pay the tennis instructor. Walt and Frank do poorly in school, drink too much, run away, and experiment sexually as ways to act out. Bernard, an insufferable and self-absorbed egotist, has a fling with one of his college students, while Joan sleeps with the tennis instructor.

Quite frankly, it made me squirm, watching the characters in this movie do all the right things to destroy a nuclear family.Yep, that's right, practically all of the major characters in this movie take actions and ascribe to values that can only be described as ""anti-family"".But, on the BIG plus side, in doing so, more than anything else, this movie works a poster child for why ""family values"" exist, and why they are still important.  Hence the four stars.And please, this goes way beyond the usual partisan political debates in this country where Republican Christian conservatives beat up on hedonist atheist liberal Democrats.Why should husbands remain faithful to their wives?  Why should husbands love and respect their wives?  Because if they don't, the children will lose their mother.Why should wives remain faithful to their husbands?  Why should wives love and respect their husbands?  Because if they don't, the children will lose their father.Why should parents be honest and dependable and loyal to each other and to their children?  Because that is the best way to teach their children how to behave the same way, and the best way to give those children a good start in life.In harsher times, when people could reliably depend only on their family members for survival, there was no need for preachers to preach about the importance of family values.  Family values was taught by the simple every day struggle to survive.And so as I watch this self-centered father and mother in a wealthy, comfortable, modern day America rush headlong into their destructive paths towards ""self-realization"" or whatever new Age, post-modern lifestyle it is that they are upholding, I am reminded sharply, once again, thank God, I still have my family, and I don't want to be like these people, and I don't want my kids to end up so screwed up like their kids.People with families need very much to watch this movie, for the same reasons driver's ed courses used to show movies of the gory results of car crashes to student drivers.In this country, all people are taught why they need to obey traffic laws in order to have a license to drive a car.

For those who have grown up with exceptionally educated parents, be prepared for moments of cringing and wincing when viewing this movie. Most of all, The Squid and the Whale is for those who step back and are able to appreciate and have fun with the idiosyncrasies and annoyances of our own families. Baumbach's insight into the dysfunctional family is uncanny and, in turn, tells us how dysfunctional all of our families are.  On the technical level, along with Wes Anderson and a few others, Noah Baumbach is at the forefront of what I believe to be a New American and Independent Cinema, where the actors, their words, expressions and actions are as powerful and real as the viewer meeting these people on the streets. Baumbach is a brilliant story teller of everyday life.  Like Sofia Coppola'sLost in Translation, this movie does not follow the prescription of most movies as it is rarely eventful. For this it is real, and something we can all relate to. Yes, I agree with other reviewers, Jeff Daniels performance is terrific. Like Murray in Lost in Translation, his acting career seems to only have begun.  I have also yet to see a movie in which Laura Linney was not spot on.  As for the boys, I think we have two engaging independent movie stars for us to follow for the years to come. On a note about the title of the film, for New Yorkers, how great was it to mention the Museum of Natural History and in particular, the squid and the whale which used to be in that under lighted corner of the marine exhibit.

962203,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B000CS464G,Ed Uyeshima,"[2, 3]","What I like most about this 2005 film is also ironically what I don't like about it - the untidiness of human foibles within a family and how decisions trigger actions we can't predict. Writer-director Noah Baumbach fully captures the messiness of divorce that feels authentic, no surprise since the story draws on his own family as inspiration. As the son of two writers himself, Village Voice film critic Georgia Brown and novelist Jonathan Baumbach, he knows firsthand the trauma and emotional toll that divorce has on all the participants, in particular, the children. The untidy nature of the situation, however, seems to extend to his storytelling skills as a writer.The film's premise is straightforward, even though the narrative structure often is not, as the story focuses on sixteen-year old Walt and twelve-year old Frank, the two sons of Bernard and Joan Berkman, married writers living in Brooklyn circa 1986 who decide to separate. The intellectually driven though emotionally isolated couple decides on a contrived joint-custody arrangement where the two boys shuttle back and forth between the family homestead in Park Slope and the rundown apartment the father takes across town. The dynamics causing the break-up are clear - Bernard was once a successful novelist sliding toward obscurity as a creative writing professor, while Joan is starting to enjoy success as a professional novelist. What's more and what Baumbach captures expertly with some sharp dialogue and character nuance, Bernard is an elitist suffering from wounded pride over his failure as both writer and breadwinner, while Joan is rather passive-aggressive in her emotional abandonment of Bernard and her inevitable adultery.Baumbach has fortunately recruited two fine actors to play these roles. As Bernard, Jeff Daniels, whom I briefly saw do an execrable Richard Dreyfuss impression in the TV-movie update of ""The Goodbye Girl"" before his sharp cameo in George Clooney's ""Goodnight and Good Luck."", is not afraid to show the unlikable nature of his ego-centric character and achieves resonance in letting us peek at the pained man inside. It's a refreshingly fearless turn by an actor who hasn't done anything this interesting since Woody Allen's ""The Purple Rose of Cairo"". I like to think of Bernard as an older, more cynical and severely hardened version of his Flap Horton in James Brooks's ""Terms of Endearment"", that is, if Flap actually made it as a writer. In the less showy but equally unsentimental role of Joan, Laura Linney once again proves she is among the top echelon of screen actresses today with her piercing intelligence coming through her often bedraggled appearance.The two sons naturally take sides once their lives are impacted. In the difficult role of belligerent Walt, Jesse Eisenberg performs admirably as his often intolerable character shares his father's self-serving anger at his mother's success, blaming her unilaterally for the divorce. Owen Kline (son of Kevin) plays Frank in a more open-faced but sadly subversive manner, as his young character copes through unbridled gulps of alcohol and exhibitionistic masturbation. On the sidelines are a couple of surprisingly effective performances - William Baldwin (yes, that Billy Baldwin) tweaking his own superficial stereotype as a local tennis pro who plays an unexpected role with the Berkmans, and Anna Paquin - who ironically played Daniels's daughter in the family film, ""Fly Away Home"" - as a coquettish coed who unwisely moves into an extra room in Bernard's apartment.Surprisingly, this is one of those films that actually feels too truncated at only 88 minutes, and consequently, there are lapses in the film that make it feel more like a series of episodes than a story that has a point to convey, especially as the ending feels abrupt and confusing. There is also one gaping plot hole regarding a song Walt claims to have composed and then sings at a school talent night.

It is vaguely depressing and mildly disturbing, yes, but it captures the aftermath of divorce wonderfully and truthfully. Simply put, this Indy film is the fantastically honest film that ""Hollywood"" could never have achieved so brilliantly.The movie revolves around a family that consists of two parents, both with PhD's in literature, and two very confused and f**ked up kids. The dad, played by Jeff Daniels, absolutely BECOMES the character of the proverbially eccentric professor who harbors serious insecurities, yet puts on a good show of arrogance and self-possession. The mother, played by Laura Linney, is a brilliant writer who outshines her husband's talents, but has a habit of being brutally honest (usually in an unflattering way) as well as sexually promiscuous. The two sons, deeply effected by the split of their parents and the tug-of-war in which they find themselves, have their own unique and affecting obstacles to hurdle. It is in the story of the two sons that the film hits emotional paydirt. As the upbringing of each boy has been light years away from anything resembling traditional, the way in which each chooses to act out is not what I would call a ""text book"" example.If you have divorced parents, or are close with someone who does (let's face it: that is the overwhelming majority of us), you will find more than a grain of truth in this film.While ""The Squid and the Whale"" marks the breaking apart of a family, it is also a fantastic coming-of-age story that is refreshingly without the often typical ersatz Hollywood pathos. I guess what I am trying to say is that, as much as I might like their films, the Tom Cruises and Angelina Jolies could never have, in a million years, accomplished what has been done here. This is a story, at least the basis of a story, that many share in one form or another, but rarely talk about in such frank and honest terms.

(One wonders how the variance toward abnormal is actually to be measured, since these preternaturally insightful and sensitive boys - well,they are from Brooklyn - are hardly normal in any way to begin with.)  It is not so much because of how the divorce impacts others, for no one in the story seems to care for anybody other than himself or herself.  Rather it's because their quirky individual worlds have been knocked sideways.  The film traces the boys' reactions, first immediate then subsequently episodically through the film, with the parents' angry exchanges - glances, gestures, words, actions - as a backdrop.  The chronicle of breakdown continues until father Bernard (masterfully played by Jeff Daniels) has a heart attack.  The focus of course is on ""Walt"" (the Baumbach character) apparently as he finally faces his fears in a final, metaphorical scene.Sans kids, the non-story puts one right in mind of ""Diary of A Mad Housewife"":  Laura Linney's ""Joan"" is really ""Teen"" five years later.  (Laura Linney is once again marvelous in her portrayal, although I think underutilized by the director.  I wish she would break out of these roles for good, however.)  The claustrophobic, dreary New York interiors - and indeed the way the scenes are shot - focus us into the worlds of these really inconsequential characters embedded in their drab, inconsequential reactions much more than either they or we deserve.  This IS biography - apparently autobiography, a bad one and a bald indulgence:  there is really nothing of any value in it other than the writer writing about himself.But there is more onanism than that:  what we really have from Baumbach is a ""hero quest"" with the Walt persona winning through to self-understanding - apparently all that matters.  Let's forget about Frank whom we leave drinking freely and smearing his semen all over the place.  Let's forget about Mom, who really began her acting out when she started her affairs.  And of course let's forget about Dad because ... well, he's too f****d up for anybody to give a damn.  Walt, er, Noah wins through and that's what matters - apparently.This movie is not ""squirmy funny"" or ""funny"" in the least.  It chronicles a sadly distant, symbiotic family all caught up in themselves to the exclusion of other in their family caught up in disintegration of their loveless symbiosis.  That would be good to mark and protest in such a film:  such families are all too common now (apparently especially in NY).  Unfortunately, this is all the writer's own massive turbation:  alas, it appears to be his ""family.""

962208,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000CS464G,Grady Harp,"[1, 3]","Noah Baumbach makes an impressive debut as writer/director of his autobiographical story THE SQUID AND THE WHALE. It is a piece of life sliced out of the 1980s that is just as pertinent to today's culture as it was to the period piece Baumbach resurrects.Bernard Berkman (Jeff Daniels) is a shell of a being, a once famous writer who is now living as an unctuous teacher while his wife Joan (Laura Linney) is rising in fame as a novelist. Their marriage is obviously tired: 17 years have endured dissatisfactions that have finally bubbled to the surface where the couple decides to separate.  They have two boys: Walt (Jesse Eisenberg) is a teenager who writes music and worships his father's literary mind while the younger Frank (Owen Kline) is a wide eyed devotee of his mother's affection.  They are polarized in their commitments to their separating parents and struggle with the business of adapting to joint custody and split homes.  Walt escapes into music that results in an embarassing secret and into nascent sexual experiences with his plain girlfriend Sophie (Halley Feiffer), encountering sexual dysfunction in ego damaging ways.  Frank responds with his own brand of sexual dysfunction that is at once hilarious and disturbing.  Bernard takes on a licentious student Lili (Anna Paquin) who is without a place to stay, complicating libido-driven Frank's life and blurring Bernard's perception of propriety.  When it is discovered that Joan has been having affairs throughout the marriage and is now involved with the boys' tennis coach Ivan (William Baldwin), the family's fragile surface cracks open and the fracture is a compound one.  How this dysfunctional family unit copes with the new way of life is the means to the end of the film.While each of the actors gives career defining performances (even the young boys are superb) the film leaves us with  a somewhat distant feeling:  as well as these characters is each described and enacted it is very difficult to like or identify with any of them, as they are each  self-centered and narrow minded people making them difficult to enjoy.  But that fact doesn't alter the final result of a film beautifully written, directed and acted.  This is first-rate movie making from a young artist with an exciting future.  It will be great to watch for his next, less personalized story.

962209,AV3JZAYAP7GHC,B000CS464G,halda,"[2, 4]","After a promising start, with some very competent acting, dramatic set-pieces, and incisive dialogue, this film barely avoids collapsing under the weight of its own painfully self-conscious indie-ness.It's almost as if writer-director Noah Baumbach was too close to the material - he doesn't let the story breathe, and you're left with something static and ultimately tepid. Which is unfortunate because Baumbach does take significant risks in the script, and there are many moments where I too felt his characters' discomfort and ennui. I believe that's in large part due to the outstanding talents of the cast, most notably Laura Linney and Jeff Daniels, who exhibit such raw, believable honesty we find ourselves voyeuristically drawn into their dissolving marriage. It's an uncomfortable feeling and it works brilliantly.With the two sons in the family, Baumbach seems to stumble. After establishing some very important character developments, he refuses to let the plot come out of its shell. We see the younger boy's severe behavior issues, mixed with sexual confusion and possibly alcoholism, yet by the final act, this is somehow swept under the rug as we're now told to focus back on the older boy's dilemma.And his pales in comparison with the younger, but since he represents Baumbach in the script, well that's who we're supposed to root for. Meanwhile, there's very little about him that's endearing: he's a liar and an arrogant snob, living in shadow of his also arrogant intellectual father, searching for acceptance while insisting he be allowed to do thing his way. It's called being a typical teenager. But ""Squid and the Whale"" wants us to believe that his is the higher struggle - a near-Oedipal conflict trapped in the meme of the modern American dysfunctional family.Heady stuff, which I believe could have been accomplished given Baumbach's exceptional writing. But I wonder whether he too felt he was living in the shadow of another (ie Wes Anderson, who executive produced, and whose influence is all over this film, directly or otherwise), and was struggling with his identity as a filmmaker while searching for acceptance from people in his own past. Or perhaps in the rarified world of NY indie filmmaking, when looking back it's OK to cling to the amateur inside you.",3,Would make a great student film.,1163030400,"11 9, 2006",2006,2296,"['promising', 'start', 'very', 'competent', 'acting', 'dramatic', 'set-pieces', 'incisive', 'dialogue', 'film', 'barely', 'collapsing', 'weight', 'own', 'painfully', 'self-conscious', 'indie-ness.It', 'almost', 'writer-director', 'Noah', 'Baumbach', 'was', 'too', 'close', 'material', ""n't"", 'let', 'story', 'breathe', ""'re"", 'left', 'something', 'static', 'ultimately', 'tepid', 'Which', 'unfortunate', 'Baumbach', 'take', 'significant', 'risks', 'script', 'are', 'many', 'moments', 'where', 'too', 'felt', 'characters', 'discomfort', 'ennui', 'believe', 'large', 'part', 'due', 'outstanding', 'talents', 'cast', 'most', 'notably', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'Jeff', 'Daniels', 'who', 'exhibit', 'such', 'raw', 'believable', 'honesty', 'find', 'voyeuristically', 'drawn', 'dissolving', 'marriage', 'uncomfortable', 'feeling', 'two', 'sons', 'family', 'Baumbach', 'stumble', 'establishing', 'very', 'important', 'character', 'developments', 'let', 'plot', 'come', 'shell', 'see', 'younger', 'boy', 'severe', 'behavior', 'issues', 'mixed', 'sexual', 'confusion', 'possibly', 'alcoholism', 'yet', 'final', 'act', 'somehow', 'swept', 'rug', ""'re"", 'now', 'told', 'focus', 'back', 'older', 'boy', 'dilemma.And', 'pales', 'comparison', 'younger', 'Baumbach', 'script', 'well', 'who', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'root', 'Meanwhile', 'very', 'little', 'endearing', 'liar', 'arrogant', 'snob', 'living', 'shadow', 'also', 'arrogant', 'intellectual', 'father', 'searching', 'acceptance', 'insisting', 'be', 'allowed', 'do', 'thing', 'way', 'called', 'being', 'typical', 'teenager', 'Squid', 'Whale', 'believe', 'higher', 'struggle', 'near-Oedipal', 'conflict', 'trapped', 'meme', 'modern', 'American', 'dysfunctional', 'family.Heady', 'stuff', 'believe', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'accomplished', 'given', 'Baumbach', 'exceptional', 'writing', 'wonder', 'too', 'felt', 'was', 'living', 'shadow', 'ie', 'Wes', 'Anderson', 'who', 'executive', 'produced', 'influence', 'film', 'directly', 'otherwise', 'was', 'struggling', 'identity', 'filmmaker', 'searching', 'acceptance', 'people', 'own', 'past', 'perhaps', 'rarified', 'world', 'NY', 'indie', 'filmmaking', 'when', 'looking', 'back', 'OK', 'cling', 'amateur']",N/A

I recommend it too.What I really admired about this film is the character growth I noticed in the sons. I liked how the film seems unpompous and the acting is as good as it gets,really.

962211,A457S8SW690NM,B000CS464G,hi,"[1, 2]","I had wanted to see this movie for an eternity. And now I finally got to. And well, I was blown away. It is the best movie of 2005, closely edging out Oldboy.The movie combines drama and comedy but comedy reigns more often. Written and directed by Noah Bauchman, the movie is based off of his childhood experieces.Jeff Daniels is Bernard, a once famous writer, still working on a new book, but also a teacher. His wife is Joan, played by Laura Linney. She now is taking on writing and her immediate success is getting Bernard mad. They have two sons.Walt is a high schooler played by Jesse Eisenberg, getting closer and closer to his first sexual encounter. His brother Frank, played by Owen Kline, is an 11 year old (or so) finding out about sex. By the way, that's probably where the strong sexuality label comes from: Frank's masturbation.Life is going pretty well for them. Walt is passing off a Pink Floyd off as his song, Joan is getting famous and then it all goes tumbling down. Bernard and Joan get seperated and the kids are confused. Frank teams up with his mom, Walt with his dad. Their parents have joint custody so their days are divided.I also teamed up with Bernard, feeling bad for him after his wife cheated on him like 4 times.As their lives move on, Bernard starts dating one of his students played by the hot Anna Paquin. Joan starts dating Frank's tennis pro, Ivan played by William Baldwin. His catch phrase ""brother"" will make you fall to the floor in laughter.The movie deals with how the 4 members of the family deal with this. Although it is sad, the comedy comes from this and this movie is quite frankly absolutely hysterical. Frank has a huge pottymouth by the way.The movie reminded me of the Royal Tennembaums. They are very similiar but this movie is better.The acting is outstanding but Jeff Daniels dominates, giving the best perfromance of his life in an oscar candidate performance. Laura Linney is also great as are the child actors. Ann Paquin is good but William Baldwin steals the show when he's on screen.The way that Walt only aggrees with his dad is hilarious.The movie is funny, very funny but is also sad. These children are both hurt by this experience..Frank is obsessed with sex and starts drinking alcohol and Walt's relationship with his dad is ruined when his dream girl is taken from him by his dad.The movie is excellent, a powerful piece of genius with some of the best acting of the year. It's nasty and hilarious but also sad and moving. Oh and by the way, the movie is called this for a reason.",5,The best movie of 2005.

Well, if you needed more convincing, here we go.Let's start with the understanding that the premise itself is very tired. It's common in literature and film alike. I fear this is probably the new normal in film: a common story told from a slightly off-beat perspective with some particulars added for individuality. This movie's strengths are two-fold: First, the actors are perfect for the roles they occupy and second, the details make it a believable.Jeff Daniels is the selfish, insufferable, failing author who grows resentful of his blossoming and slightly neurotic wife, Laura Linney. Together they are the parents of Jesse Eisenberg, a teenager who emulates and admires his father while attempting to deal with romance, and Owen Kline, a conflicted, neglected, and complex younger brother. Anna Paquin and Halley Feiffer fill in the roles of romantic interests for Daniels and Eisenberg, and also add their own special excitement.This cast is unexpectedly amazing. The dialog and chemistry between the characters is remarkable and the peculiarities and mannerisms exhibited by each are spot-on for the characters they are trying to capture. With such complex characters, I was pleasantly surprised by the performances of Daniels and Eisenberg, who I feel were risky castings. Kline was also remarkably convincing for such an odd character.In addition to the superb acting, the details that are sprinkled throughout the movie add a bit of realism to the whole thing. The nuances of the dialog, the oddities of Kline, the neuroticism of Eisenberg, the family's preoccupation with their cat, and the desperation of Daniels to retain his parking spot are a few examples that help to flesh out and make the story a bit more special than the run-of-the-mill family turmoil plot.So, why not five stars? A few subplots remain unresolved. As this is also a new normal in Hollywood, I shouldn't be surprised. But with such lovely characters that deserved proper conclusion, I feel this was a major miss by production. I actually wanted to know what happens to them.Great film!",4,Wow.

Movies can do all that....they have jillion dollar budgets and reams of experts to make all that happen. But this film does so much more than that; it exposes the evil heart of man and the way to repair it.The dirty secret of contemporary America is that divorce is not caused by some drifting apart or changing interests. No, divorce, and the resultant family disaster is almost always the by-product of one, or sometimes two, selfish and arrogant people demanding conformity and deference without offering anything in return. Marriages do not die; they are murdered. And often the murder is as brutal and bloody as this film depicts.And yet, both protagonists, selfishly going their merry ways, would never see that their actions had anything major to do with the failure of their marriage. What is so beautiful in this film, so poignant and painful and mesmerizing, is that both parents are full of blame and unwilling to see it. They know what's wrong with their spouse, and why they deserve no love. But themselves? Well, a disappointment here, a little hurt feeling there, a pinch of envy, and you bet, I deserve something better than this.Most films (Woody Allen's come to mind) that skewer the New York intellectual do so in a charming, endearing way, chuckling at the foibles and oddities of delightful people who should not have paired up. But the truth is laid bare here. These people damage their children. They are not charming. They do not love, though they certainly lust. These are people who think of themselves, deny their role in the chaos they see around them, and blithely trust in the power of the intellect to surmount the pain they cause when they themselves cannot do so.

Pouliot,"[5, 7]","Without giving too much away, ""The Squid and the Whale"" of the title is a metaphor for a child's ability to properly understand the relationship between his parents.Joan and Bernard Berkman (ably played by Laura Linney and Jeff Daniels) are PhD parents of 14-year old Walt and 10-year old Carl. There's obvious hostility between the parents, especially from Bernard toward Joan, and soon the parents decide to split up. The rest of the film depicts the impact of that decision on the children and on themselves.Set in 1986 Brooklyn, the film shows Joan and Bernard as aging children of the 1960s. He is pompous and self-involved. She is more motherly, but seem to have little moral compass. Both talk openly, graphically and detachedly about sex, including affairs and near-affairs. Their children adore them, having always been treated as adults. But their parents' narcissism and inability to set boundaries has made their children, especially the older Walt, incapable of developing their own opinions and tastes. In a family of outsized personalities, the children become self-absorbed, cruel and unempathetic.The film is not an easy ride. It is perplexing that it is categorized as a comedy, since neither my wife nor I laughed even once. Watching this intellectual but emotionally blind foursome grope toward realistic self-understanding and compassion is difficult and frustrating. But the film does a wonderful job of making these fallible creatures into more than caricatures. The ending only hints at a hopeful resolution of the tensions laid out in the rest of the film.Tense, nerve-racking, but quite memorable.

If yes, you may find this film provides a clear-eyed look at the rupturing of a family through divorce.  Set in New York, the Squid & the Whale is both indecently funny  (for example the hilarious depiction of the writer/intellectual Bernard's decent into vacuousness via his mind numbing repetition of adjectives like ""filet"" ""dense"" and ""elegant,"" which mask Bernard's lack of deep engagement with much of anything) and sharply painfully as it traces the journey of two angry sons stumbling toward a fuller understanding of who their parents really are.For me, the most compelling storyline in this film was the coming of age tale of sixteen-year-old Walt. In the beginning of the film, Walt, and his twelve-year-old brother Frank, impotently act out against joint custody as well as their parents' unveiled sexuality. The two alternately challenge, refuse, and take on their parent's values. Over time, the sons stop reacting and begin to demand a role in creating their post-divorce lives. Walt's contempt for his mother (Laura Linney) and his glorification of his self-centered father (an acting tour de force by Jeff Daniels) begins to change as Walt experiences insight into his mother's motivation for her affairs and the nature of his mother and father's relationship (driven home to the viewer with the Squid and the Whale metaphor/exhibit at the Natural History Museum). Ultimately, we are left alone with Walt, humming ""Hey You"" by Pink Floyd, gazing at struggling monsters, facing fear, and wondering, "" what's next?""A flawless film? No. The psychological underpinnings of Bernard's dysfunction are too blatantly displayed (the long pan on his book, ""Underwater,"" and the direct reference to his film poster, ""The Mother and the Whore"" - in case you missed it in the background).  And it was a bit trite to have Walt's awakening occur during a conversation with a psychologist. But then again, one could argue that we are always blaring out the roots of our malaise to anyone who would care to listen and, perhaps it was fitting - in the context of the film -- that Walt began to understand his own mind by creating a narrative about his past happiness.  So I would say yes, definitely well worth a viewing.

The dialogue is downright outstanding with extrememley emotional and powerful acting by the entire cast including Jeff Daniels, Laura Linney, Jessie Eisenberg, and Owen Kline. The dialogue infact is so realistic that you can actually feel the hair raising tension between Jeff Daniel and Laura Linney. Jeff Daniels and Laura Linney are on the verge of a collapsing marriage in the beggining of the film. Quarrels and childish arguments are only a small portion of this dysfunctional family. Jeff Daniels, an arrogant, childish, writer who's career is currently in a slump while his wife's career is just starting to blossom with her first publication on it's way. There two boys, Frank and Walt are split up by Joint Custody creating a new problem as the boys favor different parents. Walt (Jessie Eisenberg) a promising and convincing young actor becomes preoccupied with his lovelife and brainwashing father. Frank, his younger brother cannot control his sexual urges and has high propensity to relieve himself in the library not too mention consumes alchol very frequently. Problems only get worse as Jeff Daniels soon discovers that his wife was having an affair with Walt's best friend's father and currently dates Frank's tennis instructor (William Baldwin). He cannot handle his stellar career and engages in a new relationship with one of his students Lili (Anna Paquin, I promise you he does not assist her with any birds) Despite the movies short length clocking in at just about 90 minutes, it is well paced, and the characters are well developed, infact, there are so well developed that you almost want to get know them more.

Rodriguez ""The Movie Wizard.com Revi...","[6, 11]","""The Squid and the Whale"" is a movie that shows us something we'd rather not see: The ugly side of divorce. I've always been fascinated with the way Hollywood portrays divorce. They never really portray it as something that is truly horrible, just as a ""touch luck/too bad"" thing that happens to many people. In other words, divorce is a part of human nature, and you might as well get used to it. Of course, people who have been effected by divorce will tell you otherwise. The fact that so many divorcees can watch Hollywood movies about divorce shows just how timid and kind Hollywood is to the subject.This is not one of those movies. This movie will not hold your hand and demand you not be scared by divorce. This movie does no less then get in your face and practicably beats you over the head with the horrible consequences of divorce. You may actually feel yourself worn out by the time the movie is finished. If you couldn't guess by now, the movie is about a married couple named Bernard and Joan, and their two kids Frank and Walt. Bernard and Joan have a rocky relationship. Bernard used to be a huge author, but now has trouble getting his books published. Joan used to have little interest in writing, but was inspired by her husband to try writing herself.Now the tables have turned some twenty years later, and now Joan is the successful writer and Bernard is the one with no career. They now fight all the time, with Bernard getting frustrated that he seems to be losing his power status with the family, and Joan feeling like her husband would rather have her on a leash. Soon the parents decide to divorce, to the surprise of no one (even to Frank and Walt). The kids aren't really surprised when their parents announce that they are splitting up, but they still can't really comprehend how things came to be this way. What's worse is that both kids have a parent he likes better, and the parents use this to their advantage.In what comes as the biggest blow to the audience, each of the grownup's start telling their kids stories about the other parents and giving that kid special privileges. Bernard tells Frank about affairs Joan has while they were married, and Joan lets Walt drink beer and read pornographic magazines. The bait serves it's purpose, and before you know it Frank and Walt have become pawns in their parents bickering match, and neither side will waver. A particularly heartbreaking scene comes in when Frank starts dating a girl. Both his parents have advice for him, but none of the advice he receives in on the same level, and Frank messes up with the girls because he can't decide which parent to listen to.Meanwhile, Walt picks up a couple of (truly disgusting) bad habits in order to get his parents attention, only to find out that his parents aren't really interested in solving the problem, but are rather more interested in seeing how they can put the blame for this behavior on one another. The squid and the whale is a metaphor, but what the metaphor is I won't tell you. As stated before, ""The Squid and the Whale"" is a tough movie. It takes a problem we are all too familiar with, and it presents it to us in away that many of us are unaware exists. The movie has some problems (the dad's affair with a student could have been handled better), but it is an excellent achievement in film.The movie has been playing in limited release, and it is definitely worth hunting down.

But for me, it was perfection. The reviews here are very divisive and many people loathe this film. This kind of surprised me, but then I realized that many of the films that I love separate the viewing public with passionate supporters versus equally irate detractors. In fact, I tend to think of that as a good thing. A film that can provoke such strong emotion either way is doing something right.But curiously enough, I didn't think of this film as provocative until now. I took a friend to see it who is much more into mainstream films, and they liked it quite well.Without a doubt, ""The Squid and the Whale"" boasts one of the smartest, most literate, and scathingly funny screenplays I have seen in a long while. It wasn't an accident that writer/director Noah Baumbach was up for an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay. In fact, this won Best Screenplay from many critics groups including (but not limited to) the LA Film Critics, the New York Film Critics, the National Society of Film Critics and the National Board of Review. It is a pitch perfect war of words. And that's exactly what I mean--the characters in this film are at war and their language is the weapon of choice.Essentially the plot involves a family breaking apart. Maybe people don't easily identify with them because they are intellectuals. They are pompous, superior, unkind to one another and frankly not that likable--but they're real. The father is a jerk, the mother is semi-promiscuous and the kids are disturbed. Wait a minute--sounds like my home life. In other hands, this might have played out like a TV movie of the week. But what we get here is a blistering look at relationships and dysfunction--and forget what you've heard elsewhere, THIS IS ABSOLUTELY A COMEDY. Mean spirited, at times--YES. Uncomfortable, at times--YES. But the humor is abundant. I laughed almost nonstop watching this film. Seriously.Jeff Daniels, an actor I've always been somewhat apathetic about, gives the best performance of his career. He should have given up nice guy roles long ago if this is the result. Laura Linney is great, as always. And Jesse Eisenberg and Owen Kline (son of Kevin Kline and Phoebe Cates) are first rate. I can't recommend this enough--it's riveting, powerful cinema.

His wife Joan (Laura Linney) has been learning to write and has just published her first novel.  And she's been having multiple love affairs for years.  The two separate and the battle over the kids begins.  Big brother Walt idolizes his father and hates his mother, but mostly just wants a girlfriend.  12-year old Frank sides with Mom and has some major problems of his own.This quirky little film is definitely not the ""comedy"" it claims to be.  It is drama all the way; a thought-provoking and sobering look at divorce.  The four leads are uniformly brilliant.  Jeff Daniels plays against type as a pompous windbag who likes to dominate people by being smarter than they are.  Linney is also excellent playing an evolving wife and mother.  The boys who play the sons really steal the show.  They both show a lot of depth and maturity in very challenging roles (that are the reason for the R rating).  The movie was filmed on location in Brooklyn and Manhattan and has a very real, urban feel to it.

962232,A2ICI500LRO01K,B000CS464G,Kyle Wells,"[3, 4]","I believe that we should now officially declare the quirky indie film as a genre. Genre is often defined more by stylistic criteria then by similarities in plot or theme, and for this reason I feel that the word `genre' is more than appropriate for this recent movement in film. Wes Anderson perhaps started the trend, albeit with a more directly ironic and humourous edge, but films such as ""Junebug,"" ""Me and You and Everyone We Know,"" ""Broken Flowers,"" and ""The Squid and the Whale"" continue to dominate art house screens. There is a formula with these films: take some well spoken, yet troubled characters, insert them into a situation of familial troubles or romantic uncertainty, make sure there are some weird kids around, and generously add some acoustic pop music from some bands few have heard of. And yet despite the formulaic approach I feel these films are unfortunately falling prey to, I still feel that as far as formulaic genres go, this group of films are still among the most interesting and enjoyable being made.""The Squid and the Whale"" is no exception. Sure it has a bit too much of the Anderson flair to completely avoid comparison (tennis again?), but it also has the ability, much like an Anderson film, to often have me roaring with laughter or warmly smiling at its more tender moments. The film is about a family of intellectuals of the most snobbish variety whose foundations are being torn apart and challenged as the parents (Jeff Daniels and Laura Linney) split up and attempt a joint custody of their two children. The divorce is full of the usual arguments, lies, revealed deceits, and bitter feelings any separation naturally breeds, but the disturbance of the event also brings issues and buried troubles to the surface that could never have otherwise been dealt with. Yes, the children are damaged by the split, but with the cracks in their lives finally revealed, they are given their first chance to truly deal with them.The film, like most quirky indie movies, is very well written. The dialogue is sharp as it both celebrates the intellectualism that the family revels in, while criticizing the way in which it can become an emotional shield, especially for the father. Few viewers, including myself, will get all the literary references, but the negotiation at play between the intellectual and philistine approach to life will not be lost. The film is also hilarious at moments, with my biggest laugh-out-loud moment coming as the eldest son tries to play it smooth in the bedroom of the Anna Paquin character. Any film that can provide such humourous physical (nearly sophomoric) comedy amongst numerous Kafka allusions certainly can't be all bad.So while originality points may be lost as the film easily falls into the `quirky indie film' genre that must now be recognized, it still manages to do what all of films of this genre do: make us laugh, think, and maybe even get a little emotional from time to time. This one perhaps even accomplishes this a little better then most.",4,The Quirky Indie Film genre stirkes once again,1149811200,"06 9, 2006",2006,3024,"['believe', 'should', 'now', 'officially', 'declare', 'quirky', 'indie', 'film', 'genre', 'Genre', 'often', 'defined', 'more', 'stylistic', 'criteria', 'then', 'similarities', 'plot', 'theme', 'reason', 'feel', 'word', 'genre', 'more', 'appropriate', 'recent', 'movement', 'film', 'Wes', 'Anderson', 'perhaps', 'started', 'trend', 'more', 'directly', 'ironic', 'humourous', 'edge', 'films', 'such', 'Junebug', 'Me', 'Everyone', 'Know', 'Broken', 'Flowers', 'Squid', 'Whale', 'continue', 'dominate', 'art', 'house', 'screens', 'formula', 'films', 'take', 'well', 'spoken', 'yet', 'troubled', 'characters', 'insert', 'situation', 'familial', 'troubles', 'romantic', 'uncertainty', 'make', 'sure', 'are', 'weird', 'kids', 'generously', 'add', 'acoustic', 'pop', 'music', 'bands', 'few', 'have', 'heard', 'yet', 'formulaic', 'approach', 'feel', 'films', 'are', 'unfortunately', 'falling', 'prey', 'still', 'feel', 'as', 'far', 'formulaic', 'genres', 'go', 'group', 'films', 'are', 'still', 'most', 'interesting', 'enjoyable', 'being', 'made', 'Squid', 'Whale', 'exception', 'Sure', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'Anderson', 'flair', 'completely', 'avoid', 'comparison', 'tennis', 'again', 'also', 'ability', 'much', 'Anderson', 'film', 'often', 'have', 'roaring', 'laughter', 'warmly', 'smiling', 'more', 'tender', 'moments', 'film', 'family', 'intellectuals', 'most', 'snobbish', 'variety', 'foundations', 'are', 'being', 'torn', 'apart', 'challenged', 'parents', 'Jeff', 'Daniels', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'split', 'up', 'attempt', 'joint', 'custody', 'two', 'children', 'divorce', 'full', 'usual', 'arguments', 'lies', 'revealed', 'deceits', 'bitter', 'feelings', 'separation', 'naturally', 'disturbance', 'event', 'also', 'issues', 'buried', 'troubles', 'surface', 'could', 'never', 'have', 'otherwise', 'been', 'dealt', 'Yes', 'children', 'are', 'damaged', 'split', 'cracks', 'lives', 'finally', 'revealed', 'are', 'given', 'first', 'chance', 'truly', 'deal', 'them.The', 'film', 'most', 'quirky', 'indie', 'movies', 'very', 'well', 'written', 'dialogue', 'sharp', 'intellectualism', 'family', 'revels', 'criticizing', 'way', 'can', 'become', 'emotional', 'shield', 'especially', 'father', 'Few', 'viewers', 'including', 'will', 'get', 'literary', 'references', 'negotiation', 'play', 'intellectual', 'philistine', 'approach', 'life', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'lost', 'film', 'also', 'hilarious', 'moments', 'biggest', 'laugh-out-loud', 'moment', 'coming', 'eldest', 'son', 'tries', 'play', 'smooth', 'bedroom', 'Anna', 'Paquin', 'character', 'film', 'can', 'provide', 'such', 'humourous', 'physical', 'nearly', 'sophomoric', 'comedy', 'amongst', 'numerous', 'Kafka', 'allusions', 'certainly', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'bad.So', 'originality', 'points', 'may', 'be', 'lost', 'film', 'easily', 'quirky', 'indie', 'film', 'genre', 'must', 'now', 'be', 'recognized', 'still', 'do', 'what', 'films', 'genre', 'do', 'make', 'think', 'maybe', 'even', 'get', 'little', 'emotional', 'time', 'time', 'one', 'perhaps', 'even', 'little', 'better', 'then', 'most']",N/A

As this film is, in the mid-1980s. It's set in Brooklyn, where Jeff Daniels is annoyingly realistic as a priggish pseudo-intellectual writing instructor whose books no longer sell while his wife, impeccably played by She Who Can Do No Wrong, Laura Linney, is becoming the real deal.They quarrel, they divorce, which causes serious problems for their two sons, because the couple decide to share custody, which necessitates their constantly moving back and forth (along with the family cat). Actors Jesse Eisenberg, as the older son, and Owen Kline, as the younger, portray them to perfection, and Anna Paquin and Billy Baldwin turn in great cameos as well. Halley Pfeiffer is perfect as an awkward teenager who's sort of taken with Eisenberg.The title refers to the display of these two sea creatures in battle at New York's Natural History Museum--an exhibit that has long captured the imagination of the older child.The film is a movie of incidents, of moments. There's not much of a plot, and in the end not much seems to have been resolved. But you'll probably enjoy the moments for what they are. (Owen Kline has a few over-the-top scenes.) Try it.Notes and asides: The film would have been better off simply set in the present. Modern-day cars can be seen on the streets; the subway cars have American flag decals on them (which were put on after 9-11-01); the squid and the whale exhibit was renovated a few years ago, and this is shown in the film. At one point Owen Kline objects to his left-handed desk chair, but he's left-handed.

As Bernard Berkman, a formerly successful and renowned writer--but now having serious trouble with his career--Daniels nails it perfectly. He's arrogant, pompous--a real prig. He blames everyone (mostly his wife) for the collapse of his marriage but himself. His older son, Walt, played in an astonishingly good performance by Jesse Eisenberg, at first sides with his dad, then realizes how callous his father really is.At the same time, his mother--Laura Linney in another great performance (here's an actress who can do no wrong; there isn't one film she's in where she turns in a bad performance)--is not only besting her husband in the literary game (she receives a notice from a major publisher of their forthcoming publication of her first novel), but also has her husband reveal her former four-year affair with the father of one of Walt's classmates and is currently taking up with Ivan, the smug, smarmy but nevertheless relatively good-hearted (and younger) tennis instructor played by William Baldwin, Alec's brother.So neither parent is perfect. Not by a long shot. What'a a teenager to do? Not only Walt, but Frank, Walt's younger brother, is also dramatically impacted by this rancorous marital discord, in bizarre ways that should be seen to be believed. Both boys act out their enormous frustration, rage, and general malaise in ways that relate directly to sexual/relationship dysfunction, mirroring their parents' problems.At the same time there is a large dollop of dark humor here, revealing the smarts and humor of the writer-director, Noah Baumbach (the co-writer of The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou, Wes Anderson's film; Anderson co-produced The Squid and the Whale). The ending is a fitting tribute to the title of the film which refers, perhaps, to the couple themselves...or maybe to something else?This is an intelligently written, terrifically acted film with not one bad line or one bad performance.

962240,A3SKGQSU29ZV80,B000CS464G,Lleu Christopher,"[22, 25]","The Squid and the Whale, written and directed by Noah Baumbach, is an unusually realistic, well-acted and honest film about a dysfunctional Brooklyn family in the 1980s. The film is alternately comical and serious, yet unlike most movies of this genre, it neither sentimentalizes nor demonizes any of its characters, no matter how absurd or even despicable their behavior may be. One interesting quality about this partly autobiographical film is the convincing way it portrays the values and lifestyles of a particular type of intellectual middle class family. What will disturb and even shock some viewers is the casual way these quasi-bohemian folks raise --or barely raise-- their children. Jeff Daniels and Laura Linney both give superb performances as Bernard and Joan, parents who in many ways seem more like older siblings to their children. There is an almost total absence of the usual parenting concerns --these kids curse, consume alcohol and explore their sexuality with no lectures or moral condemnation from their parents. The reason for this is twofold. Firstly, these are people who pride themselves on their sophistication and aesthetic approach to life, so they consider themselves above bourgeois morality. Secondly, they are simply too distracted with their petty conflicts (mainly with each other) to notice much of what their children are up to, aside from how it directly impacts them. The children, Walt and Frank (Jesse Eisenberg and Owen Kline, who also give great performances) are somewhat more disturbed than average adolescents. The movie begins with the family playing a doubles tennis game, with Bernard and Walt playing against Joan and Frank. This mirrors the loyalties that develop as the parents separate and try to work the kinks out of an awkward joint custody arrangement.From reading some reviews of the film, it is obvious that some people would have preferred a more moralistic tone, one that makes it clear that these parents are negligent, even evil. Yet this would have undercut one of the films' strengths, which is to portray this subculture without heavy-handed judgments. Joan and Bernard, along with their lifestyle are hardly romanticized and their flaws as parents are obvious enough. Bernard is a pompous intellectual who masks his insecurity about his fledgling writing career with an arrogant persona. For example, he calls Kafka ""one of my predecessors."" His wife, meanwhile , has been carrying on an affair for four years and wastes no time in dating new men right after the separation. Following this, Bernard begins dating one of his students. Both are largely oblivious to their children's behavior problems at school. There is a dark hilarity to the situation, helped along by Joan and Bernard's obtuseness. Despite their idiosyncrasies and flaws, these are not really terrible parents. While they are certainly self-centered, they are not cruel or even indifferent towards their children. Sadly, many conventional families are just as dysfunctional, if in a different manner. This family, with all its misery, does instill a certain regard for intellectual and artistic matters that is all too lacking in much of society, though this obviously comes at a price. In the balance,  Bernard and Joan are actually average parents whose faults manifest in unconventional ways that reflect their lifestyle. Since the film is based on the director's actual childhood, we can safely assume that he didn't grow up to be a complete basket case. I think this is what really disturbs some people - that the sky does not fall when conventional mores are not strictly followed. Or, closer to the truth, when sufficient lip service isn't paid to these mores which, after all, many people fail to live up to. Baumbach may have survived and even prospered, but he did not come away from his childhood unscathed. His real achievement here is that he is able to scour the parents, without having to rely on sanctimonious moralizing and still allow their basic humanity and positive qualities to surface.

They both have literary degrees.  She is just starting a successful writing career and has moved on from being supportive wife to a strong independent woman.  This is based on a story by Noah Baubach and is a honest look at the disintigration of a marriage.For their two children it is a traumatic revealing time.  They - and the poor cat - are stuck with moving back and forth from their mother and father's homes.  The emotional issues unfold and they slowly adjust.  The oldest boy realizes through several revealing truths that his father is not who he thought he was, nor his mother.  The youngest boy, still in elementary school, experiments with sex and alcohol.  Everyone fights - but the oldest boy has a counseling session that leads to a revelation that his mother was always there for him, while his father was absent emotionally.  He remembers when younger, he was afraid of a museum's natural history exhibit showing a squid and whale fighting in the deep blue sea. It must have been the fear of his parent's deep-seated anger that only now comes to the surface as divorce.

Quido ""quidrock""","[0, 1]","The Squid and The Whale chronicles the last days of the marriage of two Brooklyn-based academics, and their ensuing divorce.This divorce is ugly and raw, like they all can be, and the film chronicles the tensions of present and past, since Bernard (Jeff Daniels), often brings up Joan's (Laura Linney's) past mistakes, throwing them in her unwitting face in front of her sons.  Bernard is callous, and uncouth, and many of his mannerisms have been adopted by the boys - Frank's ( Owen Kline) atrocious cursing when he loses at athletic endeavors, and Walt's  (Jesse Eisenberg) tendency of name-dropping the works of great writers (without having read them).  There is a bit of the comic in the way in which the boys adopt Bernard's mannerisms, and you can just feel Baumbach's self-deprecatory humor.  That may be the underlying hint of discomfort you have in watching the film.  So true to life at its most dysfunctional, the filmgoer feels as though they are eavesdropping on Baumbach's childhood. One wonders if his own family squirmed through the premiere.For her turn, the mother, Joan, has rebelled against her marriage by quietly evolving her own writing career and in extra-marital affairs.  She is cloying towards the boys, with inappropriate nicknames for their ages (""Pickle"" and ""Chicken""), which should make them cringe before their friends.  Yet she attempts to understand them and small moments in the film reveal how much time she spent with each of them when they were younger.  But as they've grown, her unhappiness has led her to the point where she doesn't battle Bernard's custody arrangement, because she wants some of her own space.And what a farcical custody arrangement it is, with each of them ""getting"" the boys three nights a week and splitting the remaining night by switching off each week.  They make plans to do the same with the cat.  There is never a hint that, in their need to divide things exactly and equally, that they are insensitive to their kids' feelings and that the added stress of travel and feeling like a stranger in a strange land is born by each of the boys.  And of course, the ensuing ""acting out"" of each of the boys, their struggles for normalcy, seem all too surprising to both parents.Each of the four main actors has produced a performance that is finely wrought and believable, and the overall texture of the film is realistic and aching and authentic.

Unless it's funny to watch miserable, irrevocably damaged people doing horrible things to each other, themselves, their children, and your own youthful idealism. For me, it was like getting poked in the eye with a pencil -- over and over. I kept standing there, expectant, hopeful, naive, thinking maybe I wouldn't get poked in the eye any more times, but inevitably it came -- the eye poke.The movie is a long gauntlet of awkward situations, and unforgettably dreadful moments. There is no forgiveness, no redemption, no hope -- there is only wound heaped upon scar, from parent to child and back again, and from spouse to spouse -- kind of like the tennis that is a motif in the film.

I have never said, nor will I ever say, ""Can't we all just get along?""

Baumbach places too much emphasis on this, especially the parts where Frank spreads his semen in different locations all over the school (the two seen in the film are the library books, and also on another student's locker).  These scenes really detract from my overall perspective of the film, and a simple explanation of what has been going on should have sufficed, but nevertheless, I tried to keep an open mind about the rest of the film, and it really pays off.  Walt and Frank's parents, Bernard (Daniels) and Joan (Linney), are going through a divorce, and the movie is really about how people, especially the kids, cope with it.  There are great supporting performances, like Joan's tennis pro boyfriend (who also coaches Frank) played by William Baldwin, and the fiesty Lili (Anna Paquin) who moves in with Bernard.  The movie itself is very Wes Anderson-esque, but Baumbach has been doing his own thing for over ten years and there are definitely distinctions.  It's really a great coming of age story, although I don't think most people would have had a coming of age like this one.  I like the directing, I like the writing, and I like the acting.  It's really the biggest sleeper movie of 2005.",4,An Oddball Gem,1142812800,"03 20, 2006",2006,1834,"['Noah', 'Baumbach', 'back', 'somewhat', 'failure', 'co-writing', 'Wes', 'Anderson', 'Life', 'Aquatic', 'Steve', 'Zissou', 'one', 'year', 'strangest', 'funny', 'films', 'Seeing', 'how', 'autobiographical', 'guess', 'can', 'see', 'sincerity', 'seriousness', 'story', 'Jesse', 'Eisenberg', 'Walt', '16', 'year', 'old', 'two', 'extremely', 'quirky', 'oddball', 'parents', 'played', 'Jeff', 'Daniels', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'Owen', 'Kline', 'most', 'messed', 'up', 'child', 'character', 'recent', 'history', 'playing', 'part', 'Walt', 'younger', 'brother', 'who', 'recently', 'discovered', 'masturbation', 'frequently', 'course', 'movie', 'Baumbach', 'too', 'much', 'emphasis', 'especially', 'parts', 'where', 'Frank', 'semen', 'different', 'locations', 'school', 'two', 'seen', 'film', 'are', 'library', 'books', 'also', 'student', 'locker', 'scenes', 'really', 'detract', 'overall', 'perspective', 'film', 'simple', 'explanation', 'what', 'been', 'going', 'should', 'have', 'sufficed', 'nevertheless', 'tried', 'keep', 'open', 'mind', 'rest', 'film', 'really', 'off', 'Walt', 'Frank', 'parents', 'Bernard', 'Daniels', 'Joan', 'Linney', 'are', 'going', 'divorce', 'movie', 'really', 'how', 'people', 'especially', 'kids', 'cope', 'are', 'great', 'supporting', 'performances', 'Joan', 'tennis', 'pro', 'boyfriend', 'who', 'also', 'Frank', 'played', 'William', 'Baldwin', 'fiesty', 'Lili', 'Anna', 'Paquin', 'who', 'Bernard', 'movie', 'very', 'Wes', 'Anderson-esque', 'Baumbach', 'been', 'doing', 'own', 'thing', 'ten', 'years', 'are', 'definitely', 'distinctions', 'really', 'great', 'coming', 'age', 'story', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'most', 'people', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'coming', 'age', 'one', 'directing', 'like', 'writing', 'like', 'acting', 'really', 'biggest', 'sleeper', 'movie', '2005']",N/A
962247,AAYE34TCTNV2R,B000CS464G,MarlowesMom,"[0, 0]","In its oblique way, Noah Baumbach's beautifully acted, painful-to-watch ""The Squid and the Whale"" uses its literary ""A Star Is Born"" framework to ask, ""What does it mean to be a man in a changing world?"" Set in 1986, the film chronicles the disintegration of a marriage and its impact on the couple's 17- and 12-year-old sons. No easy answers to the question are forthcoming in this FOR ADULTS ONLY movie.The movie opens with the Berkham family playing doubles tennis. To win a point, Bernard, the father, teamed with elder son Walt, smashes a shot into his wife Joan, who is teamed with younger son Frank. This tennis match is the only thing Bernard can beat his wife at. An insufferably arrogant college writing professor, Bernard spouts constant streams of elitist attitude about culture in general and literature in particular. He published critically successful novels in the past but can't even find an agent for his most recent effort. Meanwhile, Knopf has accepted Joan's novel and the New Yorker is publishing excerpts from it.We learn that Bernard and Joan met at the dawn of the feminist movement, when most men still took their privilege on the top of the work and family heaps for granted. Bernard dazzled Joan and she married him because ""there was nobody like him in Columbus."" The marriage has long been troubled with affairs and other symptoms of discord. The more Joan comes into her own, the more insecure Bernard becomes, and the more condescending he acts. ""Your mother would never have thought of writing if it hadn't been for me,"" Bernard tells his sons, insisting on his share of credit for her success, even though Joan, like Bernard, has a Ph.D in literature.Shortly after the tennis match, Bernard and Joan unsurprisingly tell their sons they will be separating and they will share joint custody.  Bernard gets a house ""on the other side of the park"" because, continuing his competition with Joan, he wants a house ""just like your mother's"" but cheaper. Of course Bernard's new house, dilapidated with peeling paint, minimal furniture, and a poster of a tennis player that tennis-loving Frank does not admire, is nowhere near as nice as the family home Joan keeps.The boys shuttle back and forth miserably under the joint custody arrangement. Both parents and children act out in ways that are all the more disturbing because they are believable, and that are shown graphically. Bernard continues his ""how-dare-she"" rant against Joan to anyone who will listen. Joan dares because she's figured out after almost 20 years of marriage and sea changes in opportunities for women that Bernard is a terminal jerk and she can.If you don't want to venture into this unpleasant soup, I don't blame you, but you will miss a haunting, thought-provoking film. ""The Squid and the Whale offers a career-best performance from Jeff Daniels as the obnoxious yet egg-fragile Bernard and terrific support from Laura Linney as Joan, Jesse Eisenberg as Walt, and Owen Kline as Frank. The script and storytelling are finely wrought and heartfelt. Perhaps, having had to observe and endure the anguish of their parents' divorce, Walt and Frank will be better men than their father.",4,Beautiful Film But Not For All Tastes,1340582400,"06 25, 2012",2012,3185,"['oblique', 'way', 'Noah', 'Baumbach', 'beautifully', 'acted', 'painful-to-watch', 'Squid', 'Whale', 'literary', 'A', 'Star', 'Is', 'Born', 'framework', 'ask', 'What', 'mean', 'be', 'man', 'changing', 'world', 'Set', '1986', 'film', 'disintegration', 'marriage', 'impact', 'couple', '17-', '12-year-old', 'sons', 'easy', 'answers', 'question', 'are', 'forthcoming', 'FOR', 'ADULTS', 'ONLY', 'movie.The', 'movie', 'Berkham', 'family', 'playing', 'doubles', 'tennis', 'win', 'point', 'Bernard', 'father', 'teamed', 'elder', 'son', 'Walt', 'shot', 'wife', 'Joan', 'who', 'teamed', 'younger', 'son', 'Frank', 'tennis', 'match', 'only', 'thing', 'Bernard', 'can', 'beat', 'wife', 'insufferably', 'arrogant', 'college', 'writing', 'professor', 'Bernard', 'constant', 'streams', 'elitist', 'attitude', 'culture', 'general', 'literature', 'particular', 'published', 'critically', 'successful', 'novels', 'past', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'find', 'agent', 'most', 'recent', 'effort', 'Meanwhile', 'Knopf', 'accepted', 'Joan', 'novel', 'New', 'Yorker', 'publishing', 'excerpts', 'it.We', 'learn', 'Bernard', 'Joan', 'met', 'dawn', 'feminist', 'movement', 'when', 'most', 'men', 'still', 'took', 'privilege', 'top', 'work', 'family', 'heaps', 'granted', 'Bernard', 'dazzled', 'Joan', 'married', 'was', 'nobody', 'Columbus', 'marriage', 'long', 'been', 'troubled', 'affairs', 'other', 'symptoms', 'discord', 'more', 'Joan', 'own', 'more', 'insecure', 'Bernard', 'becomes', 'more', 'condescending', 'mother', 'would', 'never', 'have', 'thought', 'writing', 'had', ""n't"", 'been', 'Bernard', 'sons', 'insisting', 'share', 'credit', 'success', 'even', 'Joan', 'Bernard', 'Ph.D', 'literature.Shortly', 'tennis', 'match', 'Bernard', 'Joan', 'unsurprisingly', 'tell', 'sons', 'will', 'be', 'separating', 'will', 'share', 'joint', 'custody', 'Bernard', 'house', 'other', 'side', 'park', 'continuing', 'competition', 'Joan', 'house', 'just', 'mother', 'cheaper', 'course', 'Bernard', 'new', 'house', 'dilapidated', 'peeling', 'paint', 'minimal', 'furniture', 'poster', 'tennis', 'player', 'tennis-loving', 'Frank', 'not', 'admire', 'nowhere', 'near', 'as', 'nice', 'family', 'home', 'Joan', 'keeps.The', 'shuttle', 'back', 'forth', 'miserably', 'joint', 'custody', 'arrangement', 'parents', 'children', 'act', 'out', 'ways', 'are', 'more', 'disturbing', 'are', 'believable', 'are', 'shown', 'graphically', 'Bernard', 'how-dare-she', 'rant', 'Joan', 'anyone', 'who', 'will', 'listen', 'Joan', 'figured', 'out', 'almost', '20', 'years', 'marriage', 'sea', 'changes', 'opportunities', 'women', 'Bernard', 'terminal', 'jerk', 'can.If', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'venture', 'unpleasant', 'soup', 'do', ""n't"", 'blame', 'will', 'miss', 'haunting', 'thought-provoking', 'film', 'Squid', 'Whale', 'career-best', 'performance', 'Jeff', 'Daniels', 'obnoxious', 'yet', 'egg-fragile', 'Bernard', 'terrific', 'support', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'Joan', 'Jesse', 'Eisenberg', 'Walt', 'Owen', 'Kline', 'Frank', 'script', 'storytelling', 'are', 'finely', 'wrought', 'heartfelt', 'Perhaps', 'having', 'had', 'observe', 'endure', 'anguish', 'parents', 'divorce', 'Walt', 'Frank', 'will', 'be', 'better', 'men', 'father']",N/A

962250,A1FG91CM8221X1,B000CS464G,Miles D. Moore,"[2, 3]","Noah Baumbach's ""The Squid and the Whale"" is a funny, touching, harrowing film about the damage family members do to each other during and after a divorce. The title refers to an exhibit in New York's Museum of Natural History, depicting an actual sea battle between a sperm whale and a giant squid--two adversaries of equal power, with equal right on their side. This is a perfect metaphor for the split in the Berkman family: Bernard (Jeff Daniels) is enraged by Joan's (Laura Linney) extramarital affairs, but we see clearly how Bernard's pompous, miserly, passive-aggressive behavior drove Joan away. (It doesn't help that Joan's career as a novelist is burgeoning while Bernard's is stagnating.) Walt (Jesse Eisenberg), their elder son, is vociferously his father's son, parroting his father's opinions on literature, women and life, while younger son Frank (Owen Kline) is more quietly but just as firmly his mother's son. Thus is set the battleground of resentments, recriminations and shifting loyalties that is laid out once Bernard and Joan sit Walt and Frank down, tell them they're divorcing, and describe the elaborate joint custody plan they've worked out. (""But what about the cat?"" the boys cry.) Walt and Frank never expected to be the children of divorce, and their sense of dislocation comes out in ever greater spasms of misbehavior. Complicating matters are Ivan (William Baldwin, doing his usual slacker shtick), the tennis pro Joan falls for, and Lili (Anna Paquin, very good as usual), the writing student who comes on to both Bernard and Walt. The cinematography (deliberately) looks rough, but the screenplay and performances are so seamless that it doesn't seem like we're watching actors playing roles; we feel like eavesdroppers on a family's private pain. Daniels, Linney, Eisenberg and Kline all give performances that can fairly be described as perfect. Even if you yourself are not a divorcee or a child of divorce, you will find that ""The Squid and the Whale"" is filled with funny, painful emotional truth.",5,"There ain't no good guys, there ain't no bad guys...",1131926400,"11 14, 2005",2005,2040,"['Noah', 'Baumbach', 'Squid', 'Whale', 'funny', 'touching', 'harrowing', 'film', 'damage', 'family', 'members', 'do', 'other', 'divorce', 'title', 'refers', 'exhibit', 'New', 'York', 'Museum', 'Natural', 'History', 'depicting', 'actual', 'sea', 'battle', 'sperm', 'whale', 'giant', 'squid', 'two', 'adversaries', 'equal', 'power', 'equal', 'right', 'side', 'perfect', 'metaphor', 'split', 'Berkman', 'family', 'Bernard', 'Jeff', 'Daniels', 'enraged', 'Joan', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'extramarital', 'affairs', 'see', 'clearly', 'how', 'Bernard', 'pompous', 'miserly', 'passive-aggressive', 'behavior', 'drove', 'Joan', 'away', ""n't"", 'help', 'Joan', 'career', 'novelist', 'burgeoning', 'Bernard', 'stagnating', 'Walt', 'Jesse', 'Eisenberg', 'elder', 'son', 'vociferously', 'father', 'son', 'parroting', 'father', 'opinions', 'literature', 'women', 'life', 'younger', 'son', 'Frank', 'Owen', 'Kline', 'more', 'quietly', 'just', 'firmly', 'mother', 'son', 'Thus', 'set', 'battleground', 'resentments', 'recriminations', 'shifting', 'loyalties', 'laid', 'out', 'once', 'Bernard', 'Joan', 'sit', 'Walt', 'Frank', 'down', 'tell', ""'re"", 'divorcing', 'describe', 'elaborate', 'joint', 'custody', 'plan', ""'ve"", 'worked', 'out', 'what', 'cat', 'boys', 'cry', 'Walt', 'Frank', 'never', 'expected', 'be', 'children', 'divorce', 'sense', 'dislocation', 'out', 'ever', 'greater', 'spasms', 'misbehavior', 'Complicating', 'matters', 'are', 'Ivan', 'William', 'Baldwin', 'doing', 'usual', 'slacker', 'shtick', 'tennis', 'pro', 'Joan', 'falls', 'Lili', 'Anna', 'Paquin', 'very', 'good', 'usual', 'writing', 'student', 'who', 'Bernard', 'Walt', 'cinematography', 'deliberately', 'rough', 'screenplay', 'performances', 'are', 'so', 'seamless', ""n't"", 'seem', ""'re"", 'watching', 'actors', 'playing', 'roles', 'feel', 'eavesdroppers', 'family', 'private', 'pain', 'Daniels', 'Linney', 'Eisenberg', 'Kline', 'give', 'performances', 'can', 'fairly', 'be', 'described', 'perfect', 'Even', 'are', 'not', 'divorcee', 'child', 'divorce', 'will', 'find', 'Squid', 'Whale', 'filled', 'funny', 'painful', 'emotional', 'truth']",N/A

The ""pre-modern"" family is perhaps the nuclear family of the 50's, husband and wife, forever married; two point a fraction of kids, dog, cat, etc.  With a window, offered by Noah Baumbach's vision, to the life and times of a semi-eccentric academic Brooklyn family, the Berkmans, the viewer gets a picture of what it is like for a family to move from the pre-modern nuclear family to the post-modern ""joint custody"" family.  The vision is flinchingly honest, emotionally crippling to all involved, and frankly not pretty what a family goes through moving from stability to divorce.Baumbach gets all sorts of good performances from the acting troupe that pulls off ""The Squid and The Whale.""  Jeff Daniels is extremely spot-on playing the father and washed up novelist, tennis fanatic, and smug elitist.  Laura Linney is well...Laura Linney.  Her performance as one part loving mother, one-part life-long polygamist, is so believable as to think you know her living in your own community (and kind of wish you were the tennis instructor played very humorously by William Baldwin).The power of the story is the emotional toil the break-up of the family takes on the two Berkman children manifesting in ways sad and twisted.  To be subjected to the image of a probably 8-9 year old boy carrying around an aluminum beer can like an alcoholic pro is disturbing and you have to think there are real-life stories out there in each of our communities that mirror this tale of the Berkmans.Ultimately ""The Squid and the Whale,"" is a worthy watch.

The stripped-down, low-budget feel of the film goes hand-in-hand with its topic. ""Kramer vs. Kramer"" this is not; it's a more realistic, hold-the-tears, in-your-face kind of portrayal of divorce with enough dry wit to keep you chuckling through an otherwise serious, stressful, sad, and all-to-common, yet personal event. Often the humor is a by-product of the parenting skills of two self-absorbed, intellectual parents who have been terribly remiss in establishing parental boundaries: obscenities are common-speak for both parents and offspring; and the children have had no problems in mirroring the faults of their parents at an early age, which in turn leads (and will lead) to further, more personal faults of their own.The only thing really resolved in this film is an acceptance by the older son of how screwed-up things are with his family.

After all, critical buzz about the picture when it was released was good, and the film was nominated for some Golden Globes and and Oscar. Well, either my hopes were too high, or the film just wasn't as good as everyone made it out to be.The film relates the disintegration of the Berkman family, who are living in 1980s Brooklyn. Father Bernard (Jeff Daniels) is a pompous, know-it-all novelist who has begun the downward arc of his career path and is now teaching literature at a college. His wife, Joan (Laura Linney), is the long-suffering mother of their two children. (But not TOO long-suffering. She's had several affairs.) When Bernard and Joan decide to call it quits, they bring children Walt (16) and Frank (12) in for a family conference to break the news. The children naturally find themselves taking sides. The duration of the movie shows how the children and their parents cope with the divorce and their changing lives.What IS good about the film - all the performances are great, with Daniels in particular fully inhabiting Bernard's academic elitism and utter vanity. Bernard is just always so sure he's right about everything. Plus, he has an angry competitive streak and doesn't seem to want anyone else to win anything except him. (No wonder Joan was boinking other guys, eh?) In addition, the characters are rendered fully on the page, although continuous reinforcements of who they are (rather than who they will become?) become tiresome as the script grinds along.What I didn't like - The plot isn't particularly compelling. We watch as the family breaks apart and how each member of the family deals with this event in different ways. But because I didn't like most of the characters, I found it difficult to care too much one way or the other. Also, I thought the movie was overly preoccupied with sex. Each character has their own manifestation of a sexual storyline, and that felt very contrived to me. In addition, there was alot of profanity, particularly from the youngest character, that I didn't think was necessary or added much to the story. But mostly, I didn't feel that enough HAPPENED. I didn't feel that the characters made any meaningful inner journeys or underwent any meaningful changes. I just felt like there was alot of extraneous junk in the script that could have been jettisoned in exchange for more of an actual plotline.So, regardless of the film's critical acclaim, I can't recommend it.

One thing the writer explored was Noah Baumbach's relationship to Wes Anderson and how different it is from Owen Wilson's relationship. Owen Wilson and Wes Anderson grew up together as equals, thus could compliment each other's skills for a well-rounded writing experience. Baumbach is too impressed with Anderson, becoming something of a yes-man and not being able to recognize the areas of weakness.This shows even more so in The Squid and the Whale, though to a different (and self-reflexively comic) degree. Noah Baumbach has something to say about his childhood experience of his parent's divorce. Stuck to his aggressively intellectual (to hide deep insecurity) father during a divorce, Noah shows a character trapped in unintellectual intellectualism, quoting and reciting platitudes without thinking for himself. The drama of the film is his character's eventual realization that he needs to break away from that thought process and begin thinking for himself.In terms of the writing, it's amazing, and the performances help. For all necessary terms of Baumbach's creativity and mood, this film is an excellent visualization and definitely shows his talent.But there's a problem: Wes Anderson. The production style of this film is a lot like Anderson's, the sort of perpendicular pastel colors of the set and the long, deep focus lens. Baumbach himself, however, chooses to use mostly a hand-held camera effect, making a disorganized camera try to exist amidst a completely organized space. The result is a breakdown of style amidst the performances. Either Baumbach needs to relax a little on Anderson's production design and figure out how he wants to create space himself... or he needs to buy himself a dolly. Now I love Anderson's work a lot, but for the purposes of Baumbach's own visualization and imagination I wish he'd drop everything he learned from Anderson and start figuring out how to make a film himself. In fact, considering some of the editing of this film, he might need a little help on craft-work instead of style.It's a real shame that this film is cluttered by Anderson's inspiration because for one thing, the writing is amazing and definitely shows Baumbach's skill on that level, and for another now it feels like Baumbach has adopted Anderson as a new father figure, blindly following his conceits without figuring out how to craft an idea himself. That is a very unfortunate thing to find in a film about coming-of-age out of dependency to his father's ideas (someone else here mentioned patricide). I'm not a big fan of deconstructive criticism, but this film's structure literally undermines its own themes.Of course really, most people don't really care about that, even if they notice. For that reason, this isn't a ""bad"" film by any means. Its writing and its characters and its performances are so awesome that often one doesn't even have the time to notice that the camera is starting to shake out of control.

Though Daniels and Linney shine, avoiding any form of cliche or attitude, it's really the two younger actors who deserve huge amounts of credit.  Child performers so often seem way too precocious (think Dakota Fanning), but these two young men do an outstanding job of portraying the children of two confused adults and showing how this confusion infects their lives and personalities.  For a stunning, thought-provoking, touching, realistic view of the darker side of family life, give this movie a viewing.If I could, I'd give it 4.5 stars. The only thing that keeps it from being a solid 5 is that it ends rather suddenly.  I'm glad that they didn't aim for any artificial, wrap-up kind of ending--that would have been annoying and it would have destroyed the delicate ambiguity they had established throughout.

You can believe the pain in the children's eyes and though their acts, in fill adolescence and awakening sexuality.

Even worse, the father cannot look into himself, and acts out the bad guy as he dates a woman his older son has a crush on while the son is mistreating a very nice girl his age.  It is all agonisingly sad to watch, and all the introspection that can lead to growing out of it is under the surface in ways that the viewer must interpret it.  That makes this a superb indie film in this way, up there with ""We Don't Live Here Anymore.""

Zwick,"[1, 3]","***1/2Using his own adolescent experiences as his source of inspiration, writer/director Noah Baumbach turns ""The Squid and the Whale"" into a searing, uncompromising look at the devastating effect divorce has on the various members of a family unit.Jeff Daniels portrays the effete Bernard Berkman, a once-successful novelist who is now an English professor at a local college in Brooklyn.  A name-dropping elitist whose every sentence drips with pretentious commentary and barely disguised contempt for the unwashed masses, Berkman clearly sees himself as the last bastion in a war against all the no-nothing ""Philistines"" who have come to ravage and ruin the culture.  It is this very attitude that Berkman seems to have inculcated into his oldest son, Walt (Jesse Eisenberg), who spends most of his time idolizing his dad, adopting his tastes in art, literature and even women, and mimicking his comments.  Laura Linney plays Bernard's wife, Joan, whose career as a writer is beginning to bloom just as Bernard's has begun to fade.  Much of the tension between the husband and wife comes from Bernard's inability to accept this turn of events.  The fourth member of the family is the younger son, Frank (Owen Kline), who is far more devoted to his mother than to his father and who begins to act out against the divorce in very bizarre and very seriously disturbed ways. The film does a fine job showing the emotional toll divorce takes on children as they often become helpless pawns in the power struggles waged by the two ""combatants.""Baumbach has kept his film simple and unadorned, rarely going for the big or grand gesture but, instead, letting the drama act itself out in small moments that are both believable and telling.  The performances by the four leads are superb down to the smallest detail, and they receive fine support from Halley Feiffer, Anna Paquin and William Baldwin in lesser but still crucial roles.""The Squid and the Whale"" barely runs 80 minutes, and although it could possibly use a bit more development of character and theme, the movie still manages to pack a great deal of insight and observation into that short time period, making it one of the most interesting movies about family relationships that we've come across in quite some time.",3,astute tale of a family in crisis,1149379200,"06 4, 2006",2006,2274,"['***1/2Using', 'own', 'adolescent', 'experiences', 'source', 'inspiration', 'writer/director', 'Noah', 'Baumbach', 'Squid', 'Whale', 'searing', 'uncompromising', 'look', 'devastating', 'effect', 'divorce', 'various', 'members', 'family', 'unit.Jeff', 'Daniels', 'effete', 'Bernard', 'Berkman', 'once-successful', 'novelist', 'who', 'now', 'English', 'professor', 'local', 'college', 'Brooklyn', 'name-dropping', 'elitist', 'sentence', 'pretentious', 'commentary', 'barely', 'disguised', 'contempt', 'unwashed', 'masses', 'Berkman', 'clearly', 'last', 'bastion', 'war', 'no-nothing', 'Philistines', 'who', 'have', 'come', 'ravage', 'ruin', 'culture', 'very', 'attitude', 'Berkman', 'have', 'inculcated', 'oldest', 'son', 'Walt', 'Jesse', 'Eisenberg', 'who', 'most', 'time', 'idolizing', 'dad', 'adopting', 'tastes', 'art', 'literature', 'even', 'women', 'mimicking', 'comments', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'Bernard', 'wife', 'Joan', 'career', 'writer', 'beginning', 'bloom', 'just', 'Bernard', 'begun', 'fade', 'Much', 'tension', 'husband', 'wife', 'Bernard', 'inability', 'accept', 'turn', 'events', 'fourth', 'member', 'family', 'younger', 'son', 'Frank', 'Owen', 'Kline', 'who', 'far', 'more', 'devoted', 'mother', 'father', 'who', 'act', 'out', 'divorce', 'very', 'bizarre', 'very', 'seriously', 'disturbed', 'ways', 'film', 'fine', 'job', 'showing', 'emotional', 'toll', 'divorce', 'children', 'often', 'become', 'helpless', 'pawns', 'power', 'struggles', 'waged', 'two', 'combatants', 'Baumbach', 'kept', 'film', 'simple', 'unadorned', 'rarely', 'going', 'big', 'grand', 'gesture', 'instead', 'letting', 'drama', 'act', 'out', 'small', 'moments', 'are', 'believable', 'telling', 'performances', 'four', 'leads', 'are', 'superb', 'down', 'smallest', 'detail', 'receive', 'fine', 'support', 'Halley', 'Feiffer', 'Anna', 'Paquin', 'William', 'Baldwin', 'lesser', 'still', 'crucial', 'roles', 'Squid', 'Whale', 'barely', '80', 'minutes', 'could', 'possibly', 'use', 'bit', 'more', 'development', 'character', 'theme', 'movie', 'still', 'pack', 'great', 'deal', 'insight', 'observation', 'short', 'time', 'period', 'making', 'one', 'most', 'interesting', 'movies', 'family', 'relationships', ""'ve"", 'come', 'quite', 'time']",N/A

962276,A1TK6R2JSC97HL,B000CS464G,Rottenberg's rotten book review,"[2, 3]","""The Squid and the Whale"" tells the story of a family being torn apart by its apparent intellect.  Bernard and Joan have been married long enough to tire of each other completely.  Joan (Laura Linney) has been a burgeoning author for years, but is only now finding enough success to escape her husband's shadow.  Bernard (the latest in a long line of horrible husbands played by Jeff Daniels) was once a great writer, but hasn't had a hit in years.  Now he molders teaching while his wife's career and motherhood eclipses his blocked fame and parental instincts.  We learn quickly that for his wisdom, Bernard is a louse.  After splitting with Joan, Bernard takes up residence in a crumbling Brooklyn brownstone, sharing his new home with Lilly (Anna Paquin), one of his students.While having strong opinions of the two parents, ""Whale"" doesn't really preach against them.  Rather, the story is more concerned with the effects on the ending of this marriage on their two sons - teenage Walt and his younger brother Frank.  Being older, Walt has very adult tastes which his father proves ready both to satisfy and (given his intellect) to rationalize.  The younger Frank proves unreceptive to his father, so Bernard pretty much ignores him.  Alienated, Frank turns to sexual and alcoholic experimentation.  Moving in with Bernard, and despite the older man's obvious decline, Walt models himself on his father, arming himself with the trappings of an intellect.  (The script ensures that he will fail - in a talent show, he performs Pink Floyd's ""Hey You"", claiming to have written the song; he takes to using the word ""Kafkaesque"" until accidentally applying it to a story about Kafka; and he utterly muffs things up with Lilly; ultimately, both of Bernard and Joan's sons will draw their parents into embarrassing confrontations at school.)""Whale"" is evocatively made, but it still seems pointless.  It's sort of like a filmed version of one of those stories you see every week in ""The New Yorker"" - academic backgrounds of the characters, references to arty movies, scenes in which characters who make critical decisions after a period of self-reflection, plots in which very little actually happens - stories which boil down to elaborate character sketches bereft of plot.

962278,A32XW50ILWOXNO,B000CS464G,Samuel McKewon,"[2, 3]","Parents screw kids up. Maybe a lot, maybe a little, and in every way imaginable, but it happens, just as surely as parents enrich and instruct their sons and daughters. Noah Baumbach's fictional memoir, ""The Squid and The Whale,"" knows that, and treats its characters- based on his family - with love, yes, but scrutiny, too. It does not declare what parents should be, but it has strong convictions about what they shouldn't:  It is a brilliant, vicious, magnetic, articulate picture about two brilliant, vicious, magnetic, articulate divorcees who inflict sublime pain on the two sons they share with a selfish kind of honesty better suited for the leather couch.""Mom, stop. I don't want to hear that from you,"" says Walt (Jesse Eisenberg) to his mother Joan (Laura Linney) as she describes some long-ago affair in the back of a storeroom.""I know,"" Joan says. "" I talk like that sometimes."" She doesn't mean she's going to stop.Joan is a writer just beginning to find her voice with pieces in The New Yorker. Ex-husband Bernard (Jeff Daniels) is a novelist, although by 1986, when the story opens, his literary star has dimmed; manuscripts are wait-listed as he teaches creative writing. The screenplay quietly suggests the divorce is tied to the shifting fortunes in Bernard and Joan's careers; certainly 16-year-old Walt believes it, and blames his mother for her wilting loyalty. But Bernard is a competitive, jealous ass - the word was invented for such a man - obsessed intellectual mannerisms and poet-warrior masculinty. He takes a house on the other side of Central Park - the ""filet of the neighborhood,"" he says - and the parents share Walt and 11-year-old Frank (Owen Kline), who prefers Joan.Baumbach has a sad soul - he presents Frank as a kind boy quickly losing his innocence amidst two absent parents - and a wonderful ear. Surely his father, writer John Baumbach, is a partial inspiration for Bernard, but he populates ""The Squid and The Whale"" with smaller, distinct characters, includng Ivan (William Baldwin), the breezy tennis pro who moves in with Joan, and Lili (Anna Paquin), one of those foolish graduate girls trying on the vixen personality for a couple years. She and Walt both tail around Bernard waiting for the verbal scraps he mindlessly passes as wisdom. Both discover divorce makes pitiful men faster than it produces such women.Bill Murray and Kevin Kline would have made good Bernards, and Jeff Bridges basically played the role in ""The Door In The loor"" -  but Daniels is the fit. Burly, offhandedly musing in his lilting voice, Bernard's really a bit stupid, and Daniels' performance captures talent trapped in accolades past. His speech and manners points to a verbose, muscular writing that lost steam in the 1980s to the ""alternative voices"" literary movement of the sick, the abused, and the minority - the kind of culture that produced James Frey's multiple lies in ""A Million Little Pieces."" As he did with Hap in ""Terms of Endearment,"" Daniels carves out sympathy for the diminished Bernard. And Linney, in an equally skilled performance, diminishes our sympathy for Joan, who indulges her awakening at the expense of her children. She is a shadow of the mother she once was, and maybe knows it. Eisenberg and Kline deliver Baumbach's lines like they know they're funny, although Eisenberg played a similiar role in Dylan Kidd's excellent ""Rodger Dodger."" The four are fine independently, clever coupled together and excellent when in a quartet.Not all of these niche films with witty, urbane screenplays and and eccentricity work. Baumbach wrote and directed a few clunkers, in fact with ""Mr. Jealousy"" and ""Highball."" But here he has the cast, the back-of-his-hand knowledge and an aim beyond the ennui and insecurity of intelligence in America.

Daniels' character Bernard was so arrogant and egocentric that his character easily could have turned into a caricature.  But Daniels plays the part with enough gusto without going over the top to keep the character real (though still bizarre).  There were plenty of times where you just wanted to scream at him for being such a self-important jerk and he makes my skin crawl, which is the mark Daniels played the character well.The reason I didn't give the movie five stars was because I just didn't like the children.  The younger son had a difficult role to play given the increasingly bizarre behavior as the movei progresses.  The situations the young actor had to portray convincingly would have been difficilt enough for an experienced actor, let alone an actor who could barely be called a young man.  My issue with the older son was that he was so ridiculous.  I feel like the part was well played, but I just wanted to punch the kid every time he ridiculed his mother or obsessively loved his father because of his extreme short-sightedness!  I realize he was under a lot of pressure during his parents' separation, but what a jerk...I disagree with previous reviewers who didn't think this movie was funny.  No, I don't think I would really call it a comedy, but there were definitely funny parts.  Like how concerned the whole family was about ""custody"" of the cat during their family talk about the parents' separation.

962282,A2PNTEDGMOLMOY,B000CS464G,Scott Schiefelbein,"[2, 3]","""The Squid and the Whale"" is a difficult movie to review.  Noah Baumbach wrote and directed this independent movie (and it screams ""I'm independent!""), which he allegedly based on his own family experience.  If that is true, Baumbach needs a hug and his parents need a sock in the mouth.This is a difficult movie to review because I think it was an excellent movie - particularly the acting - and yet the movie left me frustrated and miserable.  I was never bored, I was always intrigued, and yet I hated almost the entire viewing experience.The overview of the movie is simple, as it really has no classic three-act plot.  Bernard and Joan Berkman (Jeff Daniels and Laura Linney) are married with two boys, a teenager named Walt (Jesse Eisenberg) and a foul-mouthed ten-year old named Frank (Owen Kline).  The Berkman's marriage is either falling apart or has done so - an early scene of a family tennis match sees Joan peppered by shots from Bernard and Walt.In a traditional comedy, these tennis shots at Mom would have been cleverly done with a funny soundtrack, maybe with a ball nailing Mom in the head for effect.  In this movie, the shots at Mom are fueled by rage and the camera captures that rage dispassionately.  To say that a tone is set is putting it mildly.The movie is set in Brooklyn in the 1980s.  The Berkmans are like Brooklyn, close enough to the greatness of Manhattan to feel self-important, but not quite there.  Bernard sees himself as a great novelist, having written one well-received book.  This entitles him to belittle ""A Tale of Two Cities"" as ""minor Dickens,"" and generally treat everyone as being there for his convenience.  This, despite the fact that he lost his agent and nobody is interested in his latest book.  Joan is also a lit PhD and has a book deal.  This entitles her to tell her children, ""I need some nights away from you guys, okay!""The tagline for this movie is, ""Joint custody blows.""  It sure does for the Berkmans.  The parents split up, and Bernard moves to an ""elegant"" house in an ""elegant"" neighborhood several blocks away.  The parents agree to split the kids on different nights of the week, but it's clear that the deal has nothing to do with the kids but more to do with the parents' inability to give one inch.  The boys, naturally, take sides.  Walt sides with Bernard (he has learned that Joan had a long-standing affair), while Frank sides with Joan because Bernard is such a jerk.The movie follows these characters through their misery.  Bernard is cheap and angry.  Joan is slightly successful and selfish.  Walt passes off Pink Floyd's ""Hey You"" as a ""song I wrote"" at a school talent show.  (In a therapy session, he defends his actions because he ""thought he could have written it,"" and therefore the fact that someone had already done so is a mere technicality.)  What little Frank does to act out, besides drinking and putting cashews up his nose for long-term storage, is best left for you to discover - it's pretty unpleasasnt.The title of the movie refers to a lonely happy memory in the life of one of the boys.  Ultimately, the movie is a cautionary tale to parents everywhere that your children deny you the right to be self-absorbed jerks, because then you will teach them to be self-absorbed jerks.  Unfortunately, the very people who need to hear this message are the kind of people who will dismiss ""The Squid and the Whale"" as ""minor Baumbach.""This is far from a feel-good movie.  It's actually one of the best ""feel-bad"" movies I've ever seen.

We witness the exacerbation of these reactions in Noah Baumbach's The Squid and the Whale. This autobiographical fiction is the story of a broken family in 1986 Brooklyn. Jeff Daniels is Bernard Berkman, the self proclaimed heir to the writing style of Kafka, who in reality is a Brooklyn College literature professor who has not been able to get a novel published in some time. Laura Linney is his wife, Joan Berkman, with a burgeoning writing career of her own that has riled the jealousy of Bernard. Jesse Eisenberg plays their 16 year old son Walt, and Owen Cline plays 12 year old Frank.Bernard and Joan announce to the boys that they are separating, and the boys will rotate every night living with mom or dad. Joan has had a series of affairs, leaving every possible hint for Bernard, save jumping in the sack with one of her beaus in front of him. There is no other way to describe Bernard than to call him what he is, a pretentious [jerk]. He blames the divorce entirely on Joan, failing to see his condescending nature as in anyway responsible for the situation. Walt gravitates toward his father, trying to emulate him and win his affection, placing the blame on his mother. Owen sees through his father, sympathizing with Joan, however is not without serious problems of his own.Normally, we categorize characters as either too arrogant or full of self pity, or, too full of [poop] or drowning in their own [poop]. Despite the despicability of his character, we can still sympathize with Bernard because, in his own way, he manages to be both. His deconstructionist dismissal of, say, Tale of Two Cities as ""minor Dickens"", or his categorization of Billy Baldwin's tennis instructer character Ivan (I think every movie should have at least one Baldwin in it; and I also think that Alec Baldwin should be permanent SNL host--but that is another column altogether) as a ""Philistine"" uninterested in ""cultured"" books and movies is arrogant and condescending. Yet, we can also sense self pity in his recognition that he is not adequate enough to win his wife's love. I think that is true of all of us, at times. We think of ourselves as superior to the men that the woman who rejects us goes for instead-the ""why the heck is she with that schmuck?"" line of thought. At the same time, we also wallow in sorrow at being not good enough, and reflect on our own flaws.Walt, in trying to emulate his father, tragically succeeds. He dumps his first love for no reason other than a desire to ""do better"", whatever that means. He plays off Pink Floyd's lyrics as his own in a fear of not being adequate. He even falls for the same women as his dad, Bernard's student Lili, who has moved in with him.The tragic figure in all of this, I think, is neither Bernard, Walt, nor Joan, but Frank. Divorced parents sharing parenting responsibilities in this movie appears sort of like what happens when parents decide to raise a child in both religions. He ends up with nothing. Lack of supervision plus witnessing his parents's problems leads Frank to seek refuge in alcohol and in finding new places (often in school) to experiment with himself sexually and leave the residue (yes, I am writing in euphemisms so that this does not get edited out of Amazon. I prefer direct language).If anyone comes out a hero in this film, and I use the term ""hero"" lightly, it is Joan. She is not the best mother, and she certainly was not the best wife. She at least is willing to admit that she has done wrong. She wants to change to be a better mother for her children. She is willing to take her part of the blame, while Bernard continues to believe ""It's not my fault...""",5,The Squid and the Whale,1143331200,"03 26, 2006",2006,4864,"['Who', 'told', 'were', 'naked', 'God', 'asked', 'Did', 'eat', 'fruit', 'told', 'not', 'eat', 'man', 'answered', 'woman', 'put', 'here', 'gave', 'fruit', 'ate', 'Lord', 'God', 'asked', 'woman', 'Why', 'did', 'do', 'replied', 'snake', 'tricked', 'eating', '3:11-13', 'not', 'fault-the', 'cry', ""'ve"", 'made', 'day', 'Cain', 'was', 'born', 'Down', 'somewhere', 'heart', 'always', 'awareness', 'just', 'how', 'wrong', 'world', 'how', 'fallen', 'broken', 'incomplete', 'guilty', 'knowledge', 'failure', 'innocence', 'snarl', 'fight', 'just', 'way', 'things', 'are', 'not', 'fault', 'What', 'would', 'genuine', 'innocence', 'look', 'ever', 'came', 'world', 'know', 'answer', 'am', 'called', 'believe', 'child', 'born', 'cattle', 'shed', 'understand', 'why', 'answer', 'see', 'clearly', 'are', 'also', 'compelled', 'know', 'guilt', 'world', 'feel', 'way', 'bottom', 'Joseph', 'Bottom', 'First', 'Things', 'Online', 'Blog', 'December', '20', '2005.When', 'things', 'go', 'wrong', 'when', 'world', 'not', 'make', 'sense', 'tend', 'blame', 'others', 'self-righteously', 'denying', 'possibility', 'are', 'fault', 'cower', 'ball', 'soak', 'own', 'bile', 'self-pity', 'witness', 'exacerbation', 'reactions', 'Noah', 'Baumbach', 'Squid', 'Whale', 'autobiographical', 'fiction', 'story', 'broken', 'family', '1986', 'Brooklyn', 'Jeff', 'Daniels', 'Bernard', 'Berkman', 'self', 'proclaimed', 'heir', 'writing', 'style', 'Kafka', 'who', 'reality', 'Brooklyn', 'College', 'literature', 'professor', 'who', 'not', 'been', 'able', 'get', 'novel', 'published', 'time', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'wife', 'Joan', 'Berkman', 'burgeoning', 'writing', 'career', 'own', 'riled', 'jealousy', 'Bernard', 'Jesse', 'Eisenberg', '16', 'year', 'old', 'son', 'Walt', 'Owen', 'Cline', '12', 'year', 'old', 'Frank.Bernard', 'Joan', 'announce', 'boys', 'are', 'separating', 'boys', 'will', 'rotate', 'night', 'living', 'mom', 'dad', 'Joan', 'had', 'series', 'affairs', 'leaving', 'possible', 'hint', 'Bernard', 'save', 'jumping', 'sack', 'one', 'beaus', 'front', 'other', 'way', 'describe', 'Bernard', 'call', 'what', 'pretentious', '[', 'jerk', ']', 'divorce', 'entirely', 'Joan', 'failing', 'see', 'condescending', 'nature', 'anyway', 'responsible', 'situation', 'Walt', 'father', 'trying', 'emulate', 'win', 'affection', 'placing', 'blame', 'mother', 'father', 'sympathizing', 'Joan', 'however', 'not', 'serious', 'problems', 'own.Normally', 'categorize', 'characters', 'too', 'arrogant', 'full', 'self', 'pity', 'too', 'full', '[', 'poop', ']', 'drowning', 'own', '[', 'poop', ']', 'despicability', 'character', 'can', 'still', 'sympathize', 'Bernard', 'own', 'way', 'be', 'deconstructionist', 'dismissal', 'say', 'Tale', 'Two', 'Cities', 'minor', 'Dickens', 'categorization', 'Billy', 'Baldwin', 'tennis', 'instructer', 'character', 'Ivan', 'think', 'movie', 'should', 'have', 'least', 'one', 'Baldwin', 'also', 'think', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'should', 'be', 'permanent', 'SNL', 'host', 'column', 'altogether', 'Philistine', 'uninterested', 'cultured', 'books', 'movies', 'arrogant', 'condescending', 'can', 'also', 'sense', 'self', 'pity', 'recognition', 'not', 'adequate', 'enough', 'win', 'wife', 'love', 'think', 'true', 'times', 'think', 'ourselves', 'superior', 'men', 'woman', 'who', 'instead-the', 'why', 'heck', 'schmuck', 'line', 'thought', 'same', 'time', 'also', 'wallow', 'sorrow', 'being', 'not', 'good', 'enough', 'reflect', 'own', 'flaws.Walt', 'trying', 'emulate', 'father', 'tragically', 'dumps', 'first', 'love', 'reason', 'other', 'desire', 'do', 'better', 'Pink', 'Floyd', 'lyrics', 'own', 'fear', 'not', 'being', 'adequate', 'even', 'same', 'women', 'dad', 'Bernard', 'student', 'Lili', 'who', 'moved', 'him.The', 'tragic', 'figure', 'think', 'Bernard', 'Walt', 'Joan', 'Frank', 'Divorced', 'parents', 'sharing', 'parenting', 'responsibilities', 'movie', 'sort', 'what', 'when', 'parents', 'decide', 'raise', 'child', 'religions', 'up', 'nothing', 'Lack', 'supervision', 'witnessing', 'parents', 'problems', 'Frank', 'seek', 'refuge', 'alcohol', 'finding', 'new', 'places', 'often', 'school', 'experiment', 'sexually', 'leave', 'residue', 'yes', 'am', 'writing', 'euphemisms', 'so', 'not', 'get', 'edited', 'Amazon', 'prefer', 'direct', 'language', 'anyone', 'out', 'hero', 'film', 'use', 'term', 'hero', 'lightly', 'Joan', 'not', 'best', 'mother', 'certainly', 'was', 'not', 'best', 'wife', 'least', 'willing', 'admit', 'done', 'wrong', 'change', 'be', 'better', 'mother', 'children', 'willing', 'take', 'part', 'blame', 'Bernard', 'believe', 'not', 'fault']",N/A

The youngest son is very good and it's heartbreaking to watch him implode while is narcassistic parents fight over which is the worst and who is to blame for their failed marriage.  Daniels, channeling Flap from Terms of Endearment is quite good, but he's done this material before.  Linney is first rate as always, she is as usual not very likeable as a character, but real none the less.  I found Billy Baldwin really bizarre, but this being Wes Anderson, he is no surprise as a character.  I was not sure what to make of the ending, it was sort of like...uh..ok..I guess he had come full circle with his mother, but where did that leave Daniels character?  Granted he was hardly perfect, he was a total narcassist and miserly, but Linney was hardly perfect, she cheated on him with every single male in Brooklyn and was happy to tell everybody about it, especially her kids.

Harris,"[1, 2]","The squid and whale of the title is of course meant to be a metaphor, for life, but more accurately, the ongoing battle between two antagonists (men and women) who yet need each other.  But buried further in this name-dropping and allusive movie, is an almost overbearing homage to Godard's Breathless, which has its own multiple allusions, such as Rilke and Faulkner and the inability of men and women to live together in the modern world.  How does Daniels, playing a has-been literary lion and teacher Bernard Berkman, and his up and coming writer wife Joan, played by Laura Linney handle all this heavy stuff?  Pretty well, but how many viewers are going to pick up on the thumb across the mouth bit by both Daniels and Linney, which itself comes from Breathless?  Maybe that's why the squid and whale are in the film.  Kind of like a safety net for those not hip enough to be  up on their Goddard film history.  Still, Daniels and Linney are two really good actors, who should probably be considered for major awards.  But the people they play.  Jeez.  And their kids, Walt and Frank, know how to act out at Bernard and Joan's separation  - and quickly.  Masturbation in the library, alcohol abuse, and, mildly, plagiarizing Pink Floyd.  It's funny, at times, in that bittersweet we're all flawed Indie film sort of way. But by movie's end, you feel empty, like you have witnessed some sort of Indie style of child abuse.  Five stars for the acting.  Three stars for a story that leaves a bad taste in the mouth, and that refuses to be big enough to leave me sad or grieving (see Breathless for allusion via William Faulkner's Wild Palms).",3,"Well acted, but dreary",1164412800,"11 25, 2006",2006,1644,"['squid', 'whale', 'title', 'course', 'meant', 'be', 'metaphor', 'life', 'more', 'accurately', 'ongoing', 'battle', 'two', 'antagonists', 'men', 'women', 'who', 'yet', 'need', 'other', 'buried', 'further', 'name-dropping', 'allusive', 'movie', 'almost', 'overbearing', 'homage', 'Godard', 'Breathless', 'own', 'multiple', 'allusions', 'such', 'Rilke', 'Faulkner', 'inability', 'men', 'women', 'live', 'together', 'modern', 'world', 'How', 'Daniels', 'playing', 'has-been', 'literary', 'lion', 'teacher', 'Bernard', 'Berkman', 'up', 'coming', 'writer', 'wife', 'Joan', 'played', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'handle', 'heavy', 'stuff', 'Pretty', 'well', 'how', 'many', 'viewers', 'are', 'going', 'pick', 'up', 'thumb', 'mouth', 'bit', 'Daniels', 'Linney', 'Breathless', 'Maybe', 'why', 'squid', 'whale', 'are', 'film', 'Kind', 'safety', 'net', 'not', 'hip', 'enough', 'be', 'up', 'Goddard', 'film', 'history', 'Still', 'Daniels', 'Linney', 'are', 'two', 'really', 'good', 'actors', 'who', 'should', 'probably', 'be', 'considered', 'major', 'awards', 'people', 'play', 'Jeez', 'kids', 'Walt', 'Frank', 'know', 'how', 'act', 'out', 'Bernard', 'Joan', 'separation', 'quickly', 'Masturbation', 'library', 'alcohol', 'abuse', 'mildly', 'plagiarizing', 'Pink', 'Floyd', 'funny', 'times', 'bittersweet', ""'re"", 'flawed', 'Indie', 'film', 'sort', 'way', 'movie', 'end', 'feel', 'empty', 'have', 'witnessed', 'sort', 'Indie', 'style', 'child', 'abuse', 'Five', 'stars', 'acting', 'Three', 'stars', 'story', 'bad', 'taste', 'mouth', 'be', 'big', 'enough', 'leave', 'sad', 'grieving', 'see', 'Breathless', 'allusion', 'William', 'Faulkner', 'Wild', 'Palms']",N/A

After two kids(Walt ,16) and Frank,12) and 17 yrs years of marriage, Bernard and Joan Berkman are calling it quits.They haven't been happy in years.They sleep in separate rooms.All he does is whine about everything and bark orders at her and make fun of her ,so she starts seeing other men. Frequently.They figure that joint custody would suit them, best. Of course it doesn't. The kids began taking sides ,and refuse to stay with the other parent when it is their turn.It doesn't help that their father is extremely bitter ,because his wife got their townhouse in the divorce and that her career as a writer, has made her anovernight sensation, and he can't get anything published anymore.He tells the children about the affairs in detail, so the kids will want to stay with him.This is when things really start to heat up.Frank,believes the divorce is all his fault , and sinks into a deep depression , and starts acting out in frightening ways, such as drinking, swearing and other disturbing things that I cannot put on here.Walt, is shocked and angered by the whole thing. He remembers when his parents were happy. He blames it all on his mother for cheating and won't have anything to do with her.He also brags to the whole school,that he wrote ""Hey You"" by Pink Floyd, which is absolutely hilarious , because that is just absurd that people would not realize he was making it up.On a happier note, this movie is not all gloom and doom. There is a lot of great musical selections in it.(They even stuck a song from Schoolhouse rock in there) Also William Baldwin gives a lot of comical relief, as the laid back tennis instructor who is a positive fixture in Joan and boy's life.He also has the worst Mullet in Mullet History and has this weird catchphrase. His humor made this heavy handed movie bearable.All the actors were stellar. It was nice to see Jeff Daniels with a full beard out of his likable,but dumb character phase. I don't care what anyone says, but Laura Linney was great as the mother, Joan. In the beginning, she is like a robot, towards the end ,she grows a backbone and becomes a much happier person and does things for herself sometimes.(That does not mean I agreed with everything her character did. I just understood why she did what she did. ) In fact , I understand They why all acted they did. They all had different perspectives on what happened and Noah Baumbach showed all 4 of them, and did it well. I hope he keeps writing.He understands the human condition.All in all this a good movie. But I am warning you, no matter who you are. There are scenes inthe movie that are devastating and made to seem so real they will break your heart and make youcringe.It really explores the depth of how much carnage ensues when two people who used to love each other split up and are so busy being full of hate and fighting over what went wrong and who was right that they forget what really matters.",5,"Ain't no good guy,Ain't no bad guy just you and me and we just disagree",1235779200,"02 28, 2009",2009,3037,"['Plot', 'Details', 'opinion', 'major', 'details', 'movie', 'plot.Our', 'story', 'up', 'summer', '1986', 'two', 'kids', 'Walt', ',16', 'Frank,12', '17', 'yrs', 'years', 'marriage', 'Bernard', 'Joan', 'Berkman', 'are', 'calling', 'quits.They', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'happy', 'years.They', 'sleep', 'separate', 'rooms.All', 'whine', 'everything', 'bark', 'orders', 'make', 'fun', 'seeing', 'other', 'men', 'Frequently.They', 'figure', 'joint', 'custody', 'would', 'suit', 'best', 'course', ""n't"", 'kids', 'began', 'taking', 'sides', 'refuse', 'stay', 'other', 'parent', 'when', 'turn.It', ""n't"", 'help', 'father', 'extremely', 'bitter', 'wife', 'got', 'townhouse', 'divorce', 'career', 'writer', 'made', 'anovernight', 'sensation', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'anything', 'published', 'anymore.He', 'children', 'affairs', 'detail', 'kids', 'will', 'want', 'stay', 'him.This', 'when', 'things', 'really', 'start', 'heat', 'up.Frank', 'divorce', 'fault', 'sinks', 'deep', 'depression', 'acting', 'out', 'frightening', 'ways', 'such', 'drinking', 'swearing', 'other', 'disturbing', 'things', 'can', 'not', 'put', 'here.Walt', 'shocked', 'angered', 'whole', 'thing', 'when', 'parents', 'were', 'happy', 'mother', 'cheating', 'wo', ""n't"", 'have', 'anything', 'do', 'her.He', 'also', 'whole', 'school', 'wrote', 'Hey', 'Pink', 'Floyd', 'absolutely', 'hilarious', 'just', 'absurd', 'people', 'would', 'not', 'realize', 'was', 'making', 'up.On', 'happier', 'note', 'movie', 'not', 'gloom', 'doom', 'lot', 'great', 'musical', 'selections', 'even', 'stuck', 'song', 'Schoolhouse', 'rock', 'Also', 'William', 'Baldwin', 'lot', 'comical', 'relief', 'laid', 'back', 'tennis', 'instructor', 'who', 'positive', 'fixture', 'Joan', 'boy', 'life.He', 'also', 'worst', 'Mullet', 'Mullet', 'History', 'weird', 'catchphrase', 'humor', 'made', 'heavy', 'handed', 'movie', 'actors', 'were', 'stellar', 'was', 'nice', 'see', 'Jeff', 'Daniels', 'full', 'beard', 'likable', 'dumb', 'character', 'phase', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'what', 'anyone', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'was', 'great', 'mother', 'Joan', 'beginning', 'robot', 'end', 'backbone', 'much', 'happier', 'person', 'things', 'herself', 'sometimes', 'not', 'mean', 'agreed', 'everything', 'character', 'did', 'just', 'understood', 'why', 'did', 'what', 'did', 'fact', 'understand', 'why', 'acted', 'did', 'had', 'different', 'perspectives', 'what', 'happened', 'Noah', 'Baumbach', 'showed', '4', 'did', 'well', 'hope', 'writing.He', 'human', 'condition.All', 'good', 'movie', 'am', 'warning', 'matter', 'who', 'are', 'are', 'scenes', 'inthe', 'movie', 'are', 'devastating', 'made', 'seem', 'so', 'real', 'will', 'break', 'heart', 'make', 'youcringe.It', 'really', 'depth', 'how', 'much', 'carnage', 'ensues', 'when', 'two', 'people', 'who', 'used', 'love', 'other', 'split', 'up', 'are', 'so', 'busy', 'being', 'full', 'hate', 'fighting', 'over', 'what', 'went', 'wrong', 'who', 'was', 'right', 'forget', 'what', 'really', 'matters']",N/A

The Squid and the Whale made it into my very small DVD library very unexpectedly. It all started with a movie night at my last apartment. I didn't have anything in from Netflix, so Chris brings this movie out to screen. Of everyone I know, Chris's opinion of movies is probably the least heeded. He seems to find the worst films in the world and cherishes them while he doesn't like the best made, most entertaining, or otherwise brilliant movies. So I wasn't expecting much of anything but a sorry borefest like all his other films (for example, But I'm a Cheerleader, to be reviewed later on). When the film ended, Joe and Brian said, ""Chris, never make me watch a movie like that again,"" but I was cheering.To be sure, this is not your typical film. It doesn't start like other films, the dialog isn't like other films, the cinematic style isn't like other films, and the end is definitely unlike other films. This is the story of divorce from the perspective of two young brothers whose parents are both accomplished authors living in Brooklyn. Divorce isn't entertaining, but story telling isn't about entertainment nearly as much as it is in telling a story (obviously). Noah Baumbach did a fantastic job writing the quirky characters and their eccentric language. They aren't speaking English as you or I would speak it for they come from a literary family where they speak of Jean-Luc Godard, Orson Welles, and Franz Kafka in depth, but in a way that is non sequitur to the story but makes sense to the conversation they're having.There is a lot of similarity between Baumbach's style and that of Wes Anderson, which can be credited to Anderson's producing this particular film (Baumbach also co-wrote Anderson's The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou). It is a very serious film, but it treats the subject in a way I can only describe as ""real."" Anderson makes films that are normal things, but they're funny things, and Baumbach has this in Squid perfectly. We aren't in a comedy, we're in life, but life is funny, life is sad, life is depressing. There are points in the film where we are laughing, and other parts where we're crying, and others where we're uncomfortable - real.""Joan, let me ask you something. All that work I did at the end of our marriage, making dinners, cleaning up, being more attentive. It never was going to make a difference, was it? You were leaving no matter what...""""You never made a dinner.""""I made burgers that time you had pneumonia.""Some movies you'll watch do put you int he depressing situation, but they usually all resolve in the Hollywood fashion.

962293,A32YHUCN7W8CBE,B000CS464G,Steve Chernoski,"[5, 15]","This movie was OK.  I know it was based on director, Noah Baumbach's childhood experiences, but you are still left asking WHY Baumbach would want to tell us this story of two loser parents in a world where few of us live.  What relevance would a New York yuppie couples' problems have on most of America?  Some of the problems each character deals with are so specific to the Upper Crust of society it was tough for me to relate.  I mean how many peoples' parents have BOTH published books and argue with them about writers' styles as typical conversation?Sure the movie shows us that the kids' lives of tranquility are no longer and that they must change and cope with the hand they have been dealt.  OK.  But, the main theme I took from this film is that it shows us what not only divorce, but also ""bad parenting"" can do to kids.  If this is not one of the director's points, then I missed the boat. ""Bad parenting circa 1985"" becomes very obvious from the mothers' extramarital affairs, then hits you in the face during the father-younger son ping pong games.  The acting is good; Jeff Daniels' character never seems to take responsibility for his or his kids' mistakes and you hate him for it.  He is that old guy at the bar who gawks at the 20 something year-old-girl and doesn't realize how obvious he's being.  Laura Linney is good as the mother who has to struggle to regain her kids' confidence.On another note, the use of Tangerine Dream's theme music to ""Risky Business"" had me guessing throughout.  Maybe unfamiliar to most, I wondered if Baumbach was trying to make a connection between Tom Cruise's Joel to the younger kid in this film.  I'm pretty sure that music only played when the kid was alone, as Joel was in Risky Business.  Both movies were about growing up quickly because of troubling circumstances.  Connection?  Probably.However, even if it was not the director's primary intention, I think you will enjoy the movie more if you take it first as a warning to how we handle our children in all circumstances, and then second as an autobiographical piece about growing up.",3,How NOT to be a parent,1140480000,"02 21, 2006",2006,2097,"['movie', 'was', 'OK', 'know', 'was', 'based', 'director', 'Noah', 'Baumbach', 'childhood', 'experiences', 'are', 'still', 'left', 'asking', 'WHY', 'Baumbach', 'would', 'want', 'tell', 'story', 'two', 'loser', 'parents', 'world', 'where', 'few', 'live', 'What', 'relevance', 'would', 'New', 'York', 'yuppie', 'couples', 'problems', 'have', 'most', 'America', 'problems', 'character', 'deals', 'are', 'so', 'specific', 'Upper', 'Crust', 'society', 'was', 'tough', 'relate', 'mean', 'how', 'many', 'peoples', 'parents', 'have', 'BOTH', 'published', 'books', 'argue', 'writers', 'styles', 'typical', 'conversation', 'Sure', 'movie', 'kids', 'lives', 'tranquility', 'are', 'no', 'longer', 'must', 'change', 'cope', 'hand', 'have', 'been', 'dealt', 'OK', 'main', 'theme', 'took', 'film', 'what', 'not', 'only', 'divorce', 'also', 'bad', 'parenting', 'can', 'do', 'kids', 'not', 'one', 'director', 'points', 'then', 'missed', 'boat', 'Bad', 'parenting', 'circa', '1985', 'very', 'obvious', 'mothers', 'extramarital', 'affairs', 'then', 'face', 'father-younger', 'son', 'ping', 'pong', 'games', 'acting', 'good', 'Jeff', 'Daniels', 'character', 'never', 'take', 'responsibility', 'kids', 'mistakes', 'hate', 'old', 'guy', 'bar', 'who', '20', 'something', 'year-old-girl', ""n't"", 'realize', 'how', 'obvious', 'being', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'good', 'mother', 'who', 'struggle', 'regain', 'kids', 'confidence.On', 'note', 'use', 'Tangerine', 'Dream', 'theme', 'music', 'Risky', 'Business', 'had', 'guessing', 'Maybe', 'unfamiliar', 'most', 'wondered', 'Baumbach', 'was', 'trying', 'make', 'connection', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'Joel', 'younger', 'kid', 'film', ""'m"", 'pretty', 'sure', 'music', 'only', 'played', 'when', 'kid', 'was', 'alone', 'Joel', 'was', 'Risky', 'Business', 'movies', 'were', 'growing', 'up', 'quickly', 'troubling', 'circumstances', 'Connection', 'Probably.However', 'even', 'was', 'not', 'director', 'primary', 'intention', 'think', 'will', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'more', 'take', 'first', 'warning', 'how', 'handle', 'children', 'circumstances', 'then', 'second', 'autobiographical', 'piece', 'growing', 'up']",N/A
962294,A359IT81FBX64Y,B000CS464G,Steven Mason,"[1, 2]","The acting is fine in this film, as many reviewers have said. So enough said about that!In some ways this film reminds me of another well-acted film about a dysfunctional family, Ordinary People (1980). I think that Ordinary People is the better one, because the story gets a little deeper into the characters' heads. In The Squid and the Whale it felt like I was always looking at the surface of the characters, except for the brief scene when Walt, the older boy, talks with a counselor, and even then the surface is barely scratched. I thought it odd that the older boy met with a counselor while the younger boy did not.It didn't bother me that none of the characters were ""likeable."" It was easier to dislike the father than the mother, but the mother was pretty bad, too. I could easily sympathize with the kids, but even they were not likeable. Nor did the ambiguous ending bother me. It seemed clear enough that Walt was just beginning to come to grips with himself and his family, with the help of the counselor. Frank, the younger boy, seemed to be getting some non-professional help from his mom's lackadaisical boyfriend, the tennis instructor, though it wasn't clear how much help this guy could really give. What really bothered me was that I didn't get to know any of the characters.Other than entertainment value, I ask myself what a movie is giving me. This movie is a serious drama, not an entertainment. But what did it show me? What did I learn? This film had the courage, I will say, to show how kids can be affected by what is going on around them. There were some graphic scenes - some would say disturbing - of the younger boy ""acting out."" But again it just didn't go deeper than that. To those offended by these scenes, may I point out that there are plenty of horror movies about kids that kill and hardly anyone complains about those!

Zayas,"[5, 12]","Jeff Daniels shows his incredible acting range by playing a self-centered, egotistical, novelist past his creative prime (and seemingly in mid-life crisis.)  Laura Linney gives a rather unconvincing performance as a chronic adulteress freshly escaped from a miserable marriage to Daniels' character.  The couples' children are deeply emotionally scarred - and quickly headed for very troubled times - by their warped parents.Most of the dysfunction in the movie manifests itself in each character sexually.  The father brags to his teenage sons about the sexual exploits he missed in his youth and seduces (or allows himself to be seduced by) one of his students.  The mother reveals her past extramarital affairs and details of her current relationships to her boys.  The oldest son mistreats a girlfriend that is clearly too good for him, because he believes could ""do better.""  The youngest son masturbates in public places and smears his semen on library books and school lockers.There are really only a few redeeming things about this movie or the characters.  Perhaps the best aspect of the entire film is that Daniels' character, Bernard Berkman, is almost cartoonish in his intellectualism and professional pride.  The only really funny bits of the movie come as Bernard denigrates the work of other writers or discusses, in dismissive fashion, the artistic or cultural tastes of others.  He is a first-class literary snob.  His performance alone, and the few chuckles it generates, are enough to save the movie.But, the movie is essentially about the misery of four rather depraved people.  Dark humor and comedy have their place, but listening to adolescents and parents curse at each other and talk openly about their (broken) sex lives will be too much for many moviegoers to take.

Only where the Royal Tennanbaums is a comic fairytale, this movie has some harsh things to say about the elitist types that find The New Yorker and Harpers the height of creativity.Jeff Daniels and Laura Linney anchor this movie as the divorced parents. Laura Linney has a quiet resolve to survive no matter what her husband pulls, while Jeff Daniels is a bully that would never admit to the complicity in his life. He buys his son a desk that's for the wrong hand. He dismisses most writers as hacks or most of their work as minor. He repeats himself as if he's hit upon the greatest wisdom with his cliches. Yet you can see why his son sides with him throughout the movie.The movie mostly belongs to the oldest son, who sets out to be a copy of Jeff Daniels character and slowly realizes that he's a jerk. The scenes where he's repeating his father's dismissal of writers are painful because you know that he's just parroting his father, so when his girlfriend points out that the Metamorphasis is Kafka-esque because Kafka wrote it, he's got nothing else to say about the story. His greatest accomplishment is to play a Pink Floyd song at a talent show and pass it off as his own (the one false note is the talent show committee only catching on after they give him the prize money and asking for it back.

962302,A2GJ98824GGXGP,B000CS464G,Timothy Kearney,"[3, 4]","THE SQUID AND THE WHALE tells a simple story. Two people who were once in love separate and the children involved have to navigate the waters of a disrupted family life. It's been done before, and it will be done again, yet I have a feeling it will not be done quite the way it is done in this film. The film focuses on Bernard Beckman, played by Jeff Daniels, who is a once great writer reduced to teaching creative writing to students who are convinced of his greatness but have no idea it is a facade. His son Walt, played by Jesse Eisenberg, believes in his father's greatness and takes his side in the divorce. Much of the humor of the film is based on Bernard's pompous personality and young Walt imitating the father he finds to be so great. Joan, Bernard's wife, played by Laura Linney is the one who is having the extramarital affairs and we believe she is trapped in her marriage, but we also see she's ready to break away. Her writing career is excelling while Bernard's is declining, and Walt resents his mother on many levels, again because he's blinded by his conceptions of his father. The youngest son Frank, played by Owen Kline adds some comic relief and in some ways, it is through his actions we see how deeply pained Walt and Frank are by the divorce.The dialogue in this film is outstanding, and the acting is superb. Jeff Daniels is convincing as the once brilliant lout, and Jesse Eisenberg will have a career to watch. The conflicts raised in the film are not resolved, or at least not in the usual sense, but in a way this gives the film a realistic edge. My guess is that this film will become better known when Golden Globe and Academy Award nominations are announced. For now it will play to film lovers who will find it entertaining, but like so many wonderful films, it will take a nomination or two for it to be noticed.",4,A Film That Shows A Different Side Of Life,1132099200,"11 16, 2005",2005,1852,"['SQUID', 'THE', 'WHALE', 'simple', 'story', 'Two', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'once', 'love', 'separate', 'children', 'involved', 'have', 'navigate', 'waters', 'disrupted', 'family', 'life', 'been', 'done', 'will', 'be', 'done', 'again', 'yet', 'have', 'feeling', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'done', 'quite', 'way', 'done', 'film', 'film', 'Bernard', 'Beckman', 'played', 'Jeff', 'Daniels', 'who', 'once', 'great', 'writer', 'reduced', 'teaching', 'creative', 'writing', 'students', 'who', 'are', 'convinced', 'greatness', 'have', 'idea', 'facade', 'son', 'Walt', 'played', 'Jesse', 'Eisenberg', 'father', 'greatness', 'side', 'divorce', 'Much', 'humor', 'film', 'based', 'Bernard', 'pompous', 'personality', 'young', 'Walt', 'imitating', 'father', 'be', 'so', 'great', 'Joan', 'Bernard', 'wife', 'played', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'one', 'who', 'having', 'extramarital', 'affairs', 'believe', 'trapped', 'marriage', 'also', 'see', 'ready', 'break', 'away', 'writing', 'career', 'excelling', 'Bernard', 'declining', 'Walt', 'mother', 'many', 'levels', 'again', 'blinded', 'conceptions', 'father', 'youngest', 'son', 'Frank', 'played', 'Owen', 'Kline', 'comic', 'relief', 'ways', 'actions', 'see', 'how', 'deeply', 'pained', 'Walt', 'Frank', 'are', 'divorce.The', 'dialogue', 'film', 'outstanding', 'acting', 'superb', 'Jeff', 'Daniels', 'convincing', 'once', 'brilliant', 'lout', 'Jesse', 'Eisenberg', 'will', 'have', 'career', 'watch', 'conflicts', 'raised', 'film', 'are', 'not', 'resolved', 'least', 'not', 'usual', 'sense', 'way', 'film', 'realistic', 'edge', 'guess', 'film', 'will', 'become', 'better', 'known', 'when', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'Academy', 'Award', 'nominations', 'are', 'announced', 'now', 'will', 'play', 'film', 'lovers', 'who', 'will', 'find', 'entertaining', 'so', 'many', 'wonderful', 'films', 'will', 'take', 'nomination', 'two', 'be', 'noticed']",N/A

I happened to find it interesting and even touching, but it also features a set of characters, well-drawn and well-acted, but not the kind of people you can instantly identify with, including a boy who is seen drinking beer or masturbating in the library (played by Kevin Kline's real-life son Owen). Some things might be off-putting, but the film's insightful observations about people are genuine and delicately shown.`The Squid and the Whale"" is about the divorcing parents Mr. and Mrs. Berkman and their two young boys Walt and Frank (Jesse Eisenberg and Owen Kline) who have to deal with the new life. Jeff Daniels effectively plays Bernard Berkman, a pompous writer and father who still loves his family in his own way. That's what he thinks, but unfortunately for him, his wife Joan (Laura Linney) does not share the same values any more, and one day they decide to separate.The whole process before and after the divorce, and the two boys' reactions to it are both depicted with downbeat humor mixed with references to classic literature and pop culture. But these references are not there as in-jokes, but to show the characters' personalities. The name of ""New Yorker"" is impressive enough for the father who habitually uses his literary knowledge as weapon to dismiss others (including his wife and her books) as second-rate or `Philistine.' The elder brother Walt uses the same tactics, following the advice from his daddy, only to find later ... much too late ... the shallowness behind these words.By the time the two boys (and we) come to know the true reasons for the divorce and joint custody, we realize that the film is realistic and convincing in details describing the human nature seen in someone very close to us without making us too conscious of the narrative skills and clever script. But the descriptions are all done compassionately without any patronizing tone. Parents and brothers are not perfect humans, which is no news at all, but rarely expressed as subtly as this small film.",4,Convincing and Compelling Portrait of Family Members That Is More Poignant Than Funny,1169251200,"01 20, 2007",2007,2146,"['Squid', 'Whale', 'small', 'film', 'critics', 'would', 'unanimously', 'praise', 'not', 'general', 'viewers', 'would', 'fall', 'love', 'happened', 'find', 'interesting', 'even', 'touching', 'also', 'set', 'characters', 'well-drawn', 'well-acted', 'not', 'kind', 'people', 'can', 'instantly', 'identify', 'including', 'boy', 'who', 'seen', 'drinking', 'beer', 'masturbating', 'library', 'played', 'Kevin', 'Kline', 'real-life', 'son', 'Owen', 'things', 'might', 'be', 'off-putting', 'film', 'insightful', 'observations', 'people', 'are', 'genuine', 'delicately', 'shown.', 'Squid', 'Whale', 'divorcing', 'parents', 'Mr.', 'Mrs.', 'Berkman', 'two', 'young', 'boys', 'Walt', 'Frank', 'Jesse', 'Eisenberg', 'Owen', 'Kline', 'who', 'have', 'deal', 'new', 'life', 'Jeff', 'Daniels', 'effectively', 'Bernard', 'Berkman', 'pompous', 'writer', 'father', 'who', 'still', 'family', 'own', 'way', 'what', 'unfortunately', 'wife', 'Joan', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'not', 'share', 'same', 'more', 'one', 'day', 'decide', 'separate.The', 'whole', 'process', 'divorce', 'two', 'boys', 'reactions', 'are', 'depicted', 'downbeat', 'humor', 'mixed', 'references', 'classic', 'literature', 'pop', 'culture', 'references', 'are', 'not', 'there', 'in-jokes', 'show', 'characters', 'personalities', 'name', 'New', 'Yorker', 'impressive', 'enough', 'father', 'who', 'habitually', 'literary', 'knowledge', 'weapon', 'dismiss', 'others', 'including', 'wife', 'books', 'second-rate', 'Philistine', 'elder', 'brother', 'Walt', 'same', 'tactics', 'following', 'advice', 'daddy', 'only', 'find', 'later', 'much', 'too', 'late', 'shallowness', 'time', 'two', 'boys', 'come', 'know', 'true', 'reasons', 'divorce', 'joint', 'custody', 'realize', 'film', 'realistic', 'convincing', 'details', 'describing', 'human', 'nature', 'seen', 'someone', 'very', 'close', 'making', 'too', 'conscious', 'narrative', 'skills', 'clever', 'script', 'descriptions', 'are', 'done', 'compassionately', 'patronizing', 'tone', 'Parents', 'brothers', 'are', 'not', 'perfect', 'humans', 'news', 'rarely', 'expressed', 'as', 'subtly', 'small', 'film']",N/A

I noticed that some reviewers complained about the typical whining, screaming, and bickering between the characters over tiny issues. I don't know what kind of films or life you're living in. Who hasn't gone through a divorce without there being bickering? What kind of family doesn't yell and whine once in awhile? This movie in my opinion is very appealing, intelligent, and refreshing.

How this gem of a drama got overlooked (and why Daniels, Linney and Baumbach weren't nominated for awards is beyond me). Joan (Laura Linney) and Bernard (Jeff Daniels) are in the middle of a nasty divorce that's pulling apart the lives of their two sons Walt (Jesse) and Frank (Owen Kline). Bernard is a self important ""writer"" whose career and marriage have gone astray. He blames everyone but himself and when his wife's writing career takes off it complicates things even further making the bitterness a canyon vs. a river between them. It's clear that we have a dynsfunctional family here--one of the kids masturbates and wipes the result on items in the house as a form of revenge. Clearly this film isn't for everyone and will revolt some people. There aren't any pivotal plot points that drive the story-it's more a series of events, much like life, strung together with the emotional turmoil of the story driving the story forward. It's a riveting film but may not be for everyone.A sharp extremely good transfer is a major highlight for this film. Colors are muted but accurate and keep in mind this isn't supposed to be an eye popping film like ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"". The 5.1 sound has the quality one would expect from a new movie but keep in mind that the audio is designed for a drama not a big action film. Atmospheric effects are nicely placed around the speakers.Noah Baumbach provides an intelligent observant commentary track full of trivia about the shooting of the movie and the performances in the film. The behind-the-scenes featurette is pretty good as well with some thoughtful comments from the actors. The ""conversation"" with Baumbach and film critic Philip Lopate is probably the more interesting of the two shorts included with Baumbach discussing everything from the inspiration for the film to why the film ends the way it does.A terrific, emotional powerful film that touches on the victims of divorce, ""The Squid and the Whale"" probably had the worst title of any of the films that came out last year which may have impacted its performance with audiences.

The 80 minute film is simply about the aftermath of a divorce on a family...a very unique family in some ways, but not unlike any family in others.The Mother and Father (Linney and Daniels) both hold PHDs in Literature, and their sons display the signs of being reared by scholars. They are sensitive and analytical, both disastrous traits for children dealing with divorce. Those qualities also ripen the young characters, especially the older son who fumbles his way through trying to sound like his favorite literary authority (his father). He's still learning, however, and often times the way he name-drops writers and terms works to expose his amateurish understanding of his subject matter (like when he refers to a work by Franz Kafka as ""Kafka-esque"").As the boys and their parents have difficulties dealing with the aftermath of the divorce, the film's conflicts go into uncomfortable areas. The lady taking tickets at the theater I attended warned an inquisitive patron that ""it gets ugly"".Indeed, it does.But the ugly, unsweetened depiction of the consequences of divorce on the contemporary American family seems to be the film's thesis. For many, that will not be enough to justify a viewing.

She's most suitable to play real characters in indie films like her signature work in You Can Count On Me. It's clear that Linney has once again returned to her Indie roots by starring in The Squid and the Whale, and she truly delivered another Oscar-caliber performance. This film features probably Jeff Daniel's career-best performance, and he had a great deal of chemistry working opposite Linney and the young actors. This film could easily be made into a sad drama, but the director aimed for a comedy instead. It's a great film about the impact on a family post divorce. Honestly, I was so surprised that this film had made me laugh out loud so many times and even the saddest moments didn't move me to tears.Laura Linney plays Joan, a highly educated housewife to Bernard(Daniel) who used to be a successful writer, but reduced to literature teacher. Joan had secretly been having an affair and she had became incompatible with Bernard two years prior to their divorce that shocked their two sons(Jesse Einsberg and Owen Klein). She's also becoming an acclaimed writer when she's gets her own book published, so it instantly caused Bernard to be very jealous. They shared custody of the two boys, and it's clear that Walt(Einsberg) has a stronger bond with Bernard, while the younger son Frank is closed to Mommy. Things really fall apart in their lives as a result of the divorce. Joan started dating the local tennis pro played by William Baldwin, while Bernard hit it off with his student Lili(Anna Paquin, who was Jeff Daniel's daughter in Fly Away Home like ten years ago!) Walt becomes a liar and heartbreaker, while Frank abuses alcohol, curses at things and people, and masterbates compulsively. More disturbingly, the kid leaves his semen on lockers and books in the library. He's seriously misbehavin'. Oh, there's the cat in the house that also becomes an issue....This film successfully achieves the look of the '80s and the ragged cinematography works perfectly for it's mood.
