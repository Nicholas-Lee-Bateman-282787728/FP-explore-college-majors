987926,A34VV92TSLC37R,B000FC2HRW,Adam Craig,"[2, 2]","I love the first two Final Destination movies.  It was an original idea, and it was executed extremely well.  The car crash sequence in Final Destination 2 is one of the best I've ever seen on film.  Number 2 was also great because of its ridiculously elaborate ways to kill characters.  And the gore was some of the best in recent horror to top it all off.  The  first movie was more about plot and characters, but still had some intense moments and good kills.Needless to say, I was excited to see the third entry in what I am hoping becomes a franchise the likes of Friday the 13th or Freddy (I'm talking number of movies here, not quality-wise).  Normally I don't let myself get too excited for a movie, because I am always let down.  Well that's what happened here.  I got myself all pumped up and excited, then as the movie progressed, it just didn't do anything for me.  There were a couple moments where I was like ""that was cool,"" but nothing that made my jaw drop like in the second film.You all know the premise.  Main character has premonition of horrible death sequence (a roller coaster crash in this case), and gets people off of the ride and saves their lives.  However, Death then comes calling, in the order of how they would have died in the original incident, all the survivors start being knocked off in inconceivable, horrendous ways.  The roller coaster sequence was pretty cool, but the movie was basically downhill after that.  I got to the point where I was just counting down the minutes until the next death scene.  In the previous two, I was at least interested enough to pay attention to what the characters were saying, but at this point, how to avoid your death has been rehashed three times, and I think that's plenty.  If they are planning on making another one of these films, I suggest a new perspective on the story, because even I, a fan of the series, felt a litte tired of it after leaving the theater.",3,A step down from number 2,1139788800,"02 13, 2006",2006,1942,"['love', 'first', 'two', 'Final', 'Destination', 'movies', 'was', 'original', 'idea', 'was', 'executed', 'extremely', 'well', 'car', 'crash', 'sequence', 'Final', 'Destination', '2', 'one', 'best', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'film', 'Number', '2', 'was', 'also', 'great', 'ridiculously', 'elaborate', 'ways', 'kill', 'characters', 'gore', 'was', 'best', 'recent', 'horror', 'top', 'off', 'first', 'movie', 'was', 'more', 'plot', 'characters', 'still', 'had', 'intense', 'moments', 'good', 'kills.Needless', 'say', 'was', 'excited', 'see', 'third', 'entry', 'what', 'am', 'hoping', 'franchise', 'likes', 'Friday', '13th', 'Freddy', ""'m"", 'talking', 'number', 'movies', 'here', 'not', 'quality-wise', 'Normally', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'get', 'too', 'excited', 'movie', 'am', 'always', 'let', 'down', 'Well', 'what', 'happened', 'here', 'got', 'pumped', 'up', 'excited', 'then', 'movie', 'progressed', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'anything', 'were', 'couple', 'moments', 'where', 'was', 'was', 'cool', 'nothing', 'made', 'jaw', 'drop', 'second', 'film.You', 'know', 'premise', 'Main', 'character', 'premonition', 'horrible', 'death', 'sequence', 'roller', 'coaster', 'crash', 'case', 'people', 'ride', 'lives', 'However', 'Death', 'then', 'calling', 'order', 'how', 'would', 'have', 'died', 'original', 'incident', 'survivors', 'start', 'being', 'knocked', 'off', 'inconceivable', 'horrendous', 'ways', 'roller', 'coaster', 'sequence', 'was', 'pretty', 'cool', 'movie', 'was', 'basically', 'downhill', 'got', 'point', 'where', 'was', 'just', 'counting', 'down', 'minutes', 'next', 'death', 'scene', 'previous', 'two', 'was', 'least', 'interested', 'enough', 'pay', 'attention', 'what', 'characters', 'were', 'saying', 'point', 'how', 'avoid', 'death', 'been', 'rehashed', 'three', 'times', 'think', 'plenty', 'are', 'planning', 'making', 'one', 'films', 'suggest', 'new', 'perspective', 'story', 'even', 'fan', 'series', 'felt', 'litte', 'tired', 'leaving', 'theater']",N/A
987927,AZSN1TO0JI87B,B000FC2HRW,A. Estes,"[22, 28]","It's tough to come up with a premise for a horror movie that hasn't already been done (or done to death), but the creators of the original ""Final Destination,"" Glen Morgan and James Wong, sure had no problem back in 2000. Now, returning to the franchise they created, the respective writer and director return (after being absent for ""Final Destination 2"") with an all-new, exciting and invigorating sequel. Starring Ryan Merriman (""Halloween: Resurrection""), Mary Elizabeth Winstead (""The Ring 2""), two plastic bimbos who look too old to be high schoolers, and someone named Texas Battle (?), ""Final Destination 3"" is a lot like it's predecessors; this one isn't shy when it comes to gore and innovative and wild death scenes.Hate to make the comparison, but ""Final Destination 3"" is a lot like a rollercoaster ride. It has it's ups and downs, yet totally unpredictable. Although this movie obviously feels like a retread (kinda hard to stretch this premise to far), there are still a few elements to keep this movie feeling fresh. For starters, James Wong's directing here is a bit more stylish than it was in the original, and some of the death scenes are just as, if not, more, clever and creepy as those in the first two. This time, instead of an airplane or a car crash, our main character has hallucinations of a rollercoaster going off it's rails. After successfully getting half the people kicked off the ride, she can only watch in horror as the remaining victims plummet to their grisly deaths, as predicted. Also, as predicted, the characters wise up to ""Death's Plan"" and quickly try to find ways to avoid it. One angle that this film had that the other two lacked was a stalker that isn't supernatural. Not to ruin anything, but out of all of the events, a main character finds themselves being stalked by another. This was a cool addition to a tried and true storyline, but I just wish they would have taken it farther.If you enjoyed the first two movies, buckle up and enjoy. ""Final Destination 3"" definitely lives up to the legacy. Despite the fact that this franchise feels like it's running out of steam (and supposedly, this is the ""Final"" installment), the third movie delivers enough thrills to keep even the most discriminating horror junky happy. One thing is for sure, I'll definitely think twice next time I'm standing in line for a rollercoaster...",4,A Bit Of Sequelitis Doesn't Hurt An Entertaining Horror Flick.,1140480000,"02 21, 2006",2006,2375,"['tough', 'come', 'up', 'premise', 'horror', 'movie', ""n't"", 'already', 'been', 'done', 'done', 'death', 'creators', 'original', 'Final', 'Destination', 'Glen', 'Morgan', 'James', 'Wong', 'sure', 'had', 'problem', 'back', '2000', 'Now', 'returning', 'franchise', 'created', 'respective', 'writer', 'director', 'return', 'being', 'absent', 'Final', 'Destination', '2', 'all-new', 'exciting', 'invigorating', 'sequel', 'Starring', 'Ryan', 'Merriman', 'Halloween', 'Resurrection', 'Mary', 'Elizabeth', 'Winstead', 'Ring', '2', 'two', 'plastic', 'bimbos', 'who', 'look', 'too', 'old', 'be', 'high', 'schoolers', 'someone', 'named', 'Texas', 'Battle', 'Final', 'Destination', '3', 'lot', 'predecessors', 'one', ""n't"", 'shy', 'when', 'gore', 'innovative', 'wild', 'death', 'scenes.Hate', 'make', 'comparison', 'Final', 'Destination', '3', 'lot', 'rollercoaster', 'ride', 'ups', 'downs', 'yet', 'totally', 'unpredictable', 'movie', 'obviously', 'feels', 'retread', 'kinda', 'hard', 'stretch', 'premise', 'far', 'are', 'still', 'few', 'elements', 'keep', 'movie', 'feeling', 'fresh', 'starters', 'James', 'Wong', 'directing', 'here', 'bit', 'more', 'stylish', 'was', 'original', 'death', 'scenes', 'are', 'just', 'not', 'more', 'clever', 'creepy', 'first', 'two', 'time', 'instead', 'airplane', 'car', 'crash', 'main', 'character', 'hallucinations', 'rollercoaster', 'going', 'rails', 'successfully', 'getting', 'people', 'kicked', 'off', 'ride', 'can', 'only', 'watch', 'horror', 'remaining', 'victims', 'plummet', 'grisly', 'deaths', 'predicted', 'Also', 'predicted', 'characters', 'wise', 'up', 'Death', 'Plan', 'quickly', 'try', 'find', 'ways', 'avoid', 'One', 'angle', 'film', 'had', 'other', 'two', 'lacked', 'was', 'stalker', ""n't"", 'supernatural', 'Not', 'ruin', 'anything', 'events', 'main', 'character', 'being', 'stalked', 'was', 'cool', 'addition', 'tried', 'true', 'storyline', 'just', 'would', 'have', 'taken', 'enjoyed', 'first', 'two', 'movies', 'buckle', 'up', 'enjoy', 'Final', 'Destination', '3', 'definitely', 'up', 'legacy', 'fact', 'franchise', 'running', 'out', 'steam', 'supposedly', 'Final', 'installment', 'third', 'movie', 'delivers', 'enough', 'thrills', 'keep', 'even', 'most', 'discriminating', 'horror', 'junky', 'happy', 'One', 'thing', 'sure', ""'ll"", 'definitely', 'think', 'twice', 'next', 'time', ""'m"", 'standing', 'line', 'rollercoaster']",N/A
987928,A1PID2MT8MMPAF,B000FC2HRW,"A. Griffiths ""Adrian""","[0, 0]","Final Destination 3 is again, not a direct sequel to it's predecessors, but more of a remake under a different location and set of circumstances.  As in 1 and 2, someone has a premonition of large scale tragedy, avoids it, and then sees themselves and all the other people who cheated death fall prey to outlandish and gruesome freak accidents. Unlike the second movie, though, which tried to link the tragedies directly to the first one, this third movie in the series sees quite a streamlining of the whole ""chased by the angel of death"" situation, basically re-setting the format from scratch again, and introducing it's own new mythology, which in this case is that all the people who escape the accident are photographed just before it, and the pictures seem to predict the form death will take when it comes for them.The scene of the opening tragedy this time is a rollercoaster, and the film does quite a good job of showing some quite spectacular mayhem as the ride malfunctions. But I had hoped that the script would really crank up the tension by showing lots of loose bolts and creaking joints on attractions all around the park, however it doesn't play quite as heavily on people's general fears (that fairground rides are potential death traps) as it could have done. There's too much emphasis put on establishing the cast of characters and getting the lead character to take the required pictures of them all, rather than the ominous ride itself. The doomed ride does look pretty awesome though, but the moment when it all goes horribly wrong is filmed at such a high speed that much of the chaos is hard to see, and when it is, the CGI work is actually a bit too obvious. The famous crash from the 1977 movie ""Rollercoaster"" came to my mind as it had a vastly superior build-up in tension with it's bomb waiting to detonate on the tracks, plus the resulting crash was all filmed using full size props and real people. However, the screams of terror from the cast as the ride goes out of control look pretty convincing, and it's still bad enough to make any rollercoaster-phobe go pale, especially when the safety harnesses all flip open mid-ride AND theres a 360 degree loop is coming up...From this point on, it's little short of a full tilt run through a series of inventive and painful looking death scenes. Unlike the total freshness of the first movie (remember the impact of the bus hit?) there's little surprise left in the murders, and you always know who's turn it is, as the film places them clearly in situations just crammed full of accidents waiting to happen, such as a gymnasium or the home improvement tool shop/warehouse. The build-ups to the accidents are played on almost for fun this time and it's great entertainment to count every potentially fatal prop hovering over the hapless cast. The deaths, when they do occur, are violent and painful, and all of them will probably stir up either shock, disgust or laughter, depending on your mindset. I won't give any spoilers but the most unpleasant ones involve a tanning salon, and a nail gun. These two are clearly painful and very vicious, unlike FD 2 where nearly every death was instantaneous. The rest are just over the top splatter, but hey, at least they keep coming. I can't really decide if it's a good or bad thing that the film moves so fast, as it means there's little chance to connect with the characters as human beings, but at least it's never boring. At least some time is spent on the two leads, and they both acquit themselves well in the brief calm scenes between all the carnage, with Mary Elizabeth Winstead making an appealing heroine.I do have a gripe with the ending though, as it's neither one thing or another and clearly falls into the famous category known as ""whaaaa...?"". While it is indeed spectacular, it clearly shows that no-one really knew how to write a fitting conclusion script to go with the eye popping visuals. But it's certainly better than the original ending idea - if you buy the ""Thrill Ride"" DVD edition, you'll learn from the making-of feature ""Kill Shot"" that this ending was added after the first previews to test audiences proved unsatisfactory, and they were probably right. Whilst I'm on the subject, this documentary lasts a full hour and a half, and it provides a fine showcase on every aspect of the film from start to finish - great if you really enjoyed the main feature, and full of lots of behind the scenes shots of the many special effects.What you get for your money then, is a pretty good movie thrill-ride in which one lurid death scene is followed by another and then another, and so on, with scarcely time to take a breath in between. The characters don't have the sense of dawning awareness that they did in the first movie, so it's a much simpler game of who's next and how. And this film also dispenses with any semblance of a continuation that the second film tried to make work, leaving that entry bogged down with the ""backwards list"" and ""new life"" rules that didn't really work. The death scenes are all horrible and outrageously gory, and the pace of the movie does not let up. So put all these together, and you get a horror movie that pretty much works.",4,Good fun,1170201600,"01 31, 2007",2007,5214,"['Final', 'Destination', '3', 'again', 'not', 'direct', 'sequel',

987930,A29X0YEL6O4KZI,B000FC2HRW,"Andrew J. Dobrow ""Career Writer""","[0, 1]","The third installation of the Final Destination series is more or less, the same general theme as the first and second installment. Teen gets premonition of disaster, teen has to warn friends about their ensuing deaths while simultaneously looking out for her own life. Much of the films success is based on the fact that it plays with peoples embedded anxieties, and as it is mentioned in the movie, the fear of having no control.The opening sequence of the film is set at a carnival. A high school graduation carnival to be exact. While walking through the carnival with her friends, Wendy Christensen starts snapping out some photos with her digital camera. Even though everyone seems to be having a great time, it is evident that she is feeling uneasy. Wendy is against riding on the ultimate thrill seeking ride at the carnival, the ""Devil's Flight"" roller coaster, even though she is being urged on by her boyfriend. As the ride is prepped and ready to take off, Wendy has a vision. A vision of a horrible accident. I fear for giving to much of the movie away so that is all that I will mention concerning the plot considering that one fact can lead to many spoilers in a film such as this.As usual, for these sort of teen genre horror flicks, you've got your slew of stereotypical clique members within the film. You've got the popular girls who selfish and would ""die"" just to look good. You've got the goth anarchist smart-ass wannabes. And of course you can't forget, the cocky jock. For once in my life I would like to see a film that serves these stereotypes in digestible form rather then an overload of exaggerated personalities. But sadly, this film continues that trend of unrealistic high school personalities.From watching the film you can see that director John Woo had big plans for this movie. His camera work is creative and the handling of the special effects are done with care and precision. Though the reason this movie does not work, is because of poor script writing and mediocre acting. The script itself displays almost no character development and rushed dialog. There is also various plot holes throughout the story. Such as, why did the cops wait for 5 murders to occur before they talked to Wendy, even though she was present at 3 of them? Another script qualm is the inability to let the audience have a surprise.The suspense was always dumbed down by the occasional comic relief and the deaths were always premeditated through such cues as electrical disturbances or visions. There was no shock value within the terror.So, to summarize Final Destination 3 in a nutshell, all i can say is that I got what I expected. Their were moments of suspense building and moments of gore, but it was consistently fun throughout the whole movie. I wasn't expecting a deep and mysterious film and I didn't get one. What I was expecting was an entertaining way to spend an hour and a half and that's exactly what I got.3/5",3,Third Times A Charm...Usually,1143244800,"03 25, 2006",2006,2943,"['third', 'installation', 'Final', 'Destination', 'series', 'more', 'less', 'same', 'general', 'theme', 'first', 'second', 'installment', 'Teen', 'premonition', 'disaster', 'teen', 'warn', 'friends', 'ensuing', 'deaths', 'simultaneously', 'looking', 'out', 'own', 'life', 'Much', 'films', 'success', 'based', 'fact', 'peoples', 'embedded', 'anxieties', 'mentioned', 'movie', 'fear', 'having', 'control.The', 'opening', 'sequence', 'film', 'set', 'carnival', 'high', 'school', 'graduation', 'carnival', 'be', 'exact', 'walking', 'carnival', 'friends', 'Wendy', 'Christensen', 'snapping', 'out', 'photos', 'digital', 'camera', 'Even', 'everyone', 'be', 'having', 'great', 'time', 'evident', 'feeling', 'uneasy', 'Wendy', 'riding', 'ultimate', 'thrill', 'seeking', 'ride', 'carnival', 'Devil', 'Flight', 'roller', 'coaster', 'even', 'being', 'urged', 'boyfriend', 'ride', 'prepped', 'ready', 'take', 'off', 'Wendy', 'vision', 'vision', 'horrible', 'accident', 'fear', 'giving', 'much', 'movie', 'away', 'will', 'mention', 'concerning', 'plot', 'considering', 'one', 'fact', 'can', 'lead', 'many', 'spoilers', 'film', 'such', 'this.As', 'usual', 'sort', 'teen', 'genre', 'horror', 'flicks', ""'ve"", 'got', 'slew', 'stereotypical', 'clique', 'members', 'film', ""'ve"", 'got', 'popular', 'girls', 'who', 'selfish', 'would', 'die', 'just', 'look', 'good', ""'ve"", 'got', 'goth', 'anarchist', 'smart-ass', 'wannabes', 'course', 'ca', ""n't"", 'forget', 'cocky', 'jock', 'once', 'life', 'would', 'like', 'see', 'film', 'stereotypes', 'digestible', 'form', 'rather', 'then', 'overload', 'exaggerated', 'personalities', 'sadly', 'film', 'trend', 'unrealistic', 'high', 'school', 'watching', 'film', 'can', 'see', 'director', 'John', 'Woo', 'had', 'big', 'plans', 'movie', 'camera', 'work', 'creative', 'handling', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'done', 'care', 'precision', 'reason', 'movie', 'not', 'work', 'poor', 'script', 'writing', 'mediocre', 'acting', 'script', 'almost', 'character', 'development', 'rushed', 'dialog', 'also', 'various', 'plot', 'holes', 'story', 'Such', 'why', 'did', 'cops', 'wait', '5', 'murders', 'occur', 'talked', 'Wendy', 'even', 'was', 'present', '3', 'script', 'qualm', 'inability', 'let', 'audience', 'have', 'surprise.The', 'suspense', 'was', 'always', 'dumbed', 'down', 'occasional', 'comic', 'relief', 'deaths', 'were', 'always', 'premeditated', 'such', 'cues', 'electrical', 'disturbances', 'visions', 'was', 'shock', 'value', 'terror.So', 'summarize', 'Final', 'Destination', '3', 'nutshell', 'i', 'can', 'say', 'got', 'what', 'expected', 'were', 'moments', 'suspense', 'building', 'moments', 'gore', 'was', 'consistently', 'fun', 'whole', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'deep', 'mysterious', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'one', 'What', 'was', 'expecting', 'was', 'entertaining', 'way', 'spend', 'hour', 'half', 'exactly', 'what', 'got.3/5']",N/A
987931,A2UKC6QFG9L5GV,B000FC2HRW,Anton Ilinski,"[0, 1]","First ""Final Destination"" was great because of the idea itself. It was a little, thoughtful yet extremely entertaining movie with an idea. The second installment was mainly just entertaining although tried to develop the original idea. The third is developing nothing, it's pure entertainment, a roller-coaster ride (sometimes literal). What I didn't like here was that you knew from the very beginning what was going to happen - I'm talking about this premonition opening. The only intrigue the makers of the film created was they tried to conceal the order of deaths. They tried to mislead us, and the thrill was in the fact we didn't know who's next. We thought it'd be one character, but the Grim Reaper was taking another. As for the rest there wasn't too much sense, but honestly - did you expect any? Death scenes are tremendous, the film has great visual effects, style so to speak and inventiveness of the creators. That's actually what I was expecting to see.So ""Final Destination 3"" is a big thrill and fun, the only thing I'm afraid of is if the studio decides to make a franchise out of the series in order just to make loads of money. That wouldn't be interesting at all since we seem to know every possible plot-twist.

We should expect part 4 to come along real soon with a train. I am a fan of these films and enjoy them a lot. I thought the original film was a smart, different, and entertaining film amid the sly slasher films that were the norm. The sequel was bigger with the deaths and gore, but not as good. Now the original team that brought us the first film, have brought us the third. This one is better than the second installment. This time around, a group of graduating high schoolers are at a carnival, where a number of them get on board a scary looking rollercoaster. Like others before her, Wendy(Mary Elizabeth Winstead)has a vision that the ride will go horribly wrong and people will die. Soon enough, her vision comes true. A handful of students are thrown off the ride, and now death is looking for them. Like in the previous two, this one follows the same formula. The bunch that got thrown off are now dying one by one. Death is coming to collect those that got away. This one isn't too packed with heroes and heroines trying to figure out ""death's design"" as the previous ones, and just goes straight ahead with gruesome deaths and trying to get the victims in time. Our heroes do follow pictures that were taken at the rides to help them know how one is going to buy the farm. The only thing people go to these films for are the murders. The second film uped the ante from the first, and this one follows suit. There is no disappointment here concerning creative kills or gore. It's there in all it's glory. I never felt ""death"" hanging around as much as in the first one. These deaths just seem to happen. As for the characters, they are the usual lot. The good girl, the nice jock, the beautiful twits, the outsiders, etc. None of them have any distinction, but none of them are bad either. The movie is sharply made by James Wong, who can set up a scene and spine tingling moment with the best of them. The cast do what they can with their characters, but they weren't written with much else in mind but to be victims. Mary Elizabeth Winstead is a fine leading lady for this kind of thing, but after a while, she is just doom and gloom and is always looking dour. Seperated from the other two, Tony Todd does not appear. He does make his presence known tho. I won't tell you how or where. I'll let you try to spot him. The DVD is well packed with extra goodies, and the ""Choose Their Fate"" idea is a brilliant idea!. I wouldn't mind seeing this feature be a regular thing for certain films.

The first two were held together by characters strong enough to care about and that is lacking here.  It is the expected killings that hold this film together and luckily they are still fun and inventive.  The blu ray transfer is the strongest of the three.  Video is vivid and clear with colors that pop.  Skin tones are realistic and black/white ratioo is excellent.  The clarity is also excellent which makes the killings that much more impactful.  And the DolbyTrue HD audio track is amazing.  Dialogue is strong and present throughout but the suspense, mood and kills take on new life with this superb audio presentation.  You will be jumping out of your skin as all speakers are put to strong use.The opening scenes are the most important in each FINAL DESTINATION film and here we have a roller coaster accident.  That scene is the best of the film and the blu ray video and audio makes it a sight to behold.  After that the story and acting in particular strongly loose steam.  But the kills are still inventive and creepy, strongly enhanced by the blu ray.  I give this blu ray 4 stars for the back of the case says this is the CHOOSE THEIR FATE version, the same as the dvd and that is not here.  That is sad for the deaths are the only things that keep this film ticking along.  It would have been such an added bonus.  If you are a completist as me you will want all the FINAL DESTINATION films.  Just remember that the caliber for this film is far below the previous two.

987935,A2582KMXLK2P06,B000FC2HRW,B. E Jackson,"[0, 0]","I am a big fan of horror films, especially ones that really make you think about death.  Final Destination 3 mainly focuses on death, and the story is about predicting when and how someone is going to die.This movie was exceptionally worthwhile for the violence and blood.  The way the plot works is that each of the characters (all teenagers) are supposed to die in a certain order, and it's up to one of the girls (along with a teenage boy) to try and figure out a way to stop it from happening.  They try connecting clues from the pictures they took at a carnival, and this all adds up to a lot of careful creativity on the part of the writers.This means the boy and the girl will frequently find themselves in a situation where something doesn't feel right, and then they will remember something similar from a picture they took at the carnival.  When they realize that something from a picture happens to be right there in front of them at the moment, death begins to turn its ugly head in their direction and they have to try and escape with their lives.Let me try to make some sense of this by using an example: in one instance the girl remembers a picture she took of her male friends face up against the camera, squinting and fooling around.  This picture predicted that the boy would actually be squinting for real because of a dangerous situation he would soon encounter.  This is how the story works.The film also does a good job building suspense when a death is about to happen, because sometimes you can tell a death is just around the corner, however, the writers of the film must have really great brains because a LOT of creativity went into the way the characters in the film died.I'd say the feel of the movie was similar to that of I Know What You Did Last Summer (teenagers that die one by one) but the actual horror plotline was more interesting and violent overall in Final Destination 3.",5,a pretty nifty horror film,1171065600,"02 10, 2007",2007,1912,"['am', 'big', 'fan', 'horror', 'films', 'especially', 'ones', 'really', 'make', 'think', 'death', 'Final', 'Destination', '3', 'mainly', 'death', 'story', 'predicting', 'when', 'how', 'someone', 'going', 'die.This', 'movie', 'was', 'exceptionally', 'worthwhile', 'violence', 'blood', 'way', 'plot', 'characters', 'teenagers', 'are', 'supposed', 'die', 'certain', 'order', 'up', 'one', 'girls', 'teenage', 'boy', 'try', 'figure', 'out', 'way', 'stop', 'happening', 'try', 'connecting', 'clues', 'pictures', 'took', 'carnival', 'up', 'lot', 'careful', 'creativity', 'part', 'writers.This', 'boy', 'girl', 'will', 'frequently', 'find', 'situation', 'where', 'something', ""n't"", 'feel', 'right', 'then', 'will', 'remember', 'something', 'similar', 'picture', 'took', 'carnival', 'When', 'realize', 'something', 'picture', 'be', 'right', 'there', 'front', 'moment', 'death', 'begins', 'turn', 'ugly', 'head', 'direction', 'have', 'try', 'escape', 'lives.Let', 'try', 'make', 'sense', 'using', 'example', 'one', 'instance', 'girl', 'picture', 'took', 'male', 'friends', 'face', 'up', 'camera', 'squinting', 'fooling', 'around', 'picture', 'predicted', 'boy', 'would', 'actually', 'be', 'squinting', 'real', 'dangerous', 'situation', 'would', 'soon', 'encounter', 'how', 'story', 'works.The', 'film', 'also', 'good', 'job', 'building', 'suspense', 'when', 'death', 'happen', 'sometimes', 'can', 'tell', 'death', 'just', 'corner', 'however', 'writers', 'film', 'must', 'have', 'really', 'great', 'brains', 'LOT', 'creativity', 'went', 'way', 'characters', 'film', 'died.I', ""'d"", 'say', 'feel', 'movie', 'was', 'similar', 'Know', 'What', 'Did', 'Last', 'Summer', 'teenagers', 'die', 'one', 'one', 'actual', 'horror', 'plotline', 'was', 'more', 'interesting', 'violent', 'overall', 'Final', 'Destination', '3']",N/A

The original cast from, the first and second films have been removed entirely, but we are introduced to some interesting new young faces, including Mary Elizabeth Winstead (as the main heroine). I liked the original just as much as I did with FD2, but I absolutely LOVED FD3! Personally, I consider it to be the best one thus far even if the stubborn critics disagree! Mr. Wong knows how to entertain an audience by making his movies scary, imaginative, and fun at the same time! His work is also the most original, when compared to most of the cheap, PG-13 imitations put out today. I got the opportunity to view this with my older brother and friend at the movie theatre yesterday and wasn't in any way disappointed!Taking place six years since the tragic account of Flight 180 (See the original, ""Final Destination""), high school senior, Wendy Christensen (Winstead) has a premonition involving a fatal rollercoaster accident. Before the ride is launched, she succeeds at saving herself and most of her friends from meeting an untimely demise. But death soon comes back to re-claim its victims, as mysterious and bizarre accidents begin to occur! Now, Wendy must solve death's puzzle and save everyone before it's too late! Her only clues lead to the photographs that she took of herself and her friends at the carnival, which also represent the order that they're to die in. Will she succeed, or will death finish them all?If you've enjoyed FD1 and FD2, then you're sure to enjoy FD3 even more! The acting can drag a little here and there, but the well-written script and amazing special effects do more than make up for it! Furthermore, the death sequences are very creative and executed nicely even more so than that of the first two films (Watch out for the tanning booth and weight room scenes)! However, if you are squeamish and/or the faint of heart, then you may want to look elsewhere! You'll need a very strong stomach if you are to get through the whole movie!

987938,A32RNVRS7KEV8A,B000FC2HRW,blister,"[2, 2]","I was drawn to the original ""Final Destination"" movie because of its original premise and because of the unique combination of the supernatural and action slant of the film.  The second film wasn't as great, I couldn't click with the movie characters as a group, perhaps because of the different ages of the characters and what was said in Final Destination 3's special features about how we can relate more if there are teenagers because basically this is a ""teenagers killed"" type of movie.So I didn't see this third installment at the theaters, but instead just bought it after reading so many reviews.I found it not as good as the original, but better than the 2nd installment because of:1.  The introduction of digital camera technology providing clues as to who is going to die next yet also providing an added slant of mystery when within one of the photos, a hand is covering the identity of yet another ill fated victim.  It leaves a very good guessing game.2.  Ok, anyone who likes rollercoasters (such as myself) will enjoy the opening sequence.  However, on one note, for anyone who has seen the 1976 movie Rollercoaster about a man who plants bombs at amusement parks would note that that crash actually looked more realistic and shocking.  Still, the intro of the coaster and the thrill of getting on and waiting for it to start, then that shivering oh no anticipation of the first coaster drop-very well done!3.  I found the death sequences (while gory and YIKES, what you fellow reviewers said about the tanning bed scene, whew, were you right! Had me morbidly curious, but squirming in my chair!)more elaborate, suspenseful, and the script writers I give much credit for making them almost puzzle like in just how is death going to get them out of all of the things made available.  Kind of like the vintage Mouse trap game where so many things all boil down to the end result.  Interesting how everything comes together.3.  I liked the idea of the ending disaster sequence with two twists (SPOILER-I thought it was really happening, wasn't just a vision, then when it wasn't happening, but was going to happen, wow)  Yes, there was that obligatory every movie like this has to end with a question type of sigh on my part, but still, overall, this was a good movie and the DVD extras are plentiful and worthwhile.

Don't buy the movie for that, please.  I'm gonna spoil it for you but you'll thank me.  Anyway, GAME AND MOVIE SPOILERS:First Option:  Heads or tails when they flip a coin to see who's sitting in back on the roller coaster.  With one option, the main character has a premonition right away and then stops them mid flip and a different group of people don't even get on the ride (main girl, her boyfriend, the main boy who survived and his girlfriend).  Everyone else dies.  And then it has one of those epilogues where it shows pictures of those who survived and what they did with the rest of their lives and then it ends.  If you pick the other option, the movie goes on as it had in the theatrical version.Option #2:  In the tanning booth, do the girls turn it up to 73 or 76 degrees.  With 73 degrees, the movie doesn't change.  With 76 degrees, one of the Ashleys escapes and tries to save the other but they still both get toasted.Option #3:  In the car at the drive thru, should Wendy honk again?  Yes or no?  If you pick no, nothing changes.  If you pick yes, the creepy guy in the car survives but he never comes back again, from what I can tell, so who cares.  He disappears from the face of the movie, leaving a big gap in the logic.Option #4: Should Wendy look at the pictures again?  One choice results in the athletic guy dying as he originally did.  The other results in him dying the same way, only without the sword false alarm.Option #5:  When Ian shoots at the birds, should he kill them or not?  If he just scares them, one comes back while the girl gets it with a nailgun.  If he kills them, the girl still gets it with the nailgun, only this time, no bird appears.Option #6:  When Ian is about to get crushed, should he jump to the left or right?  Either way, he gets it, it's just that with one option, his whole body gets crushed, with the other, you see the top part of his body has been cut off.Option #7:  Concerning whether or not there's a map on the train at the end.  With one option, Wendy has a premonition of what's going to happen to them on the train and then she warns them but they can't get off and then it ends.  With the other option, the premonition is reality.I might have missed an option, I don't know.  Point is, if you want to buy the movie anyway, it can't hurt to get this.  But don't buy it just for the ""Choose their fate"" because the game is lame.  I remember the choose your own adventure books from when I was a kid.  Why couldn't it have been more like that?

They have all been entertaining, gory, and clever but the charm has finally worn off for me personally. The acting has never been first rate, horror movies rarely offer Oscar worthy performances. The formula has always been followed, someone gets a vision saves others from a terrible fate than one by one they all hand in their ""get out of death "" free card to the grim reaper. The main characters must figure out the order of death, and maybe cheat it making it skip and therefore end the cycle completely. By this third movie, it seemed to me the kill scenes were just getting a bit forced and completely unbelievable even for a supernatural causation. The tanning beds, the nail gun, the motor chopping off heads, and the exercise equipment were just off from the first two movies genius. The extra feature where you can decide their fate with your remote was a waste of time, I don't understand even putting it on there unless they really had changed some of the fates (besides the one dude with the stupid hat , which when saved just disappears and it makes no sense) I have read other reviews on here, and I have to agree with whomever pointed out that the pictures before the rollercoaster shouldn't have showed their grim fates, if they all were supposed to die on the ride, Did death know she would save them? If so than that changes everything, its not really cheating death than is it?

987944,A278AF56R7J86,B000FC2HRW,"C. Crockett ""Domino713""","[16, 16]","All throughout high school I was a devoted horror movie fan. Over the years I've lost a little of my enthusiasm for the genre as it has steadily progressed away from the edge-of-your-seat thriller that I loved so dearly, and on towards mindless gore and cheap ""pop-out"" scare tactics. Where's the excitement?Final Destination 3 is certainly a thrill ride worth taking. I almost didn't watch it, but I was intrigued by a very unique feature on the soon-to-be released DVD version. It is a 2-disc special edition that has all the usual features such as commentary and behind-the-scenes featurettes...BUT the ""intriguing"" DVD aspect I am speaking of is the ""Choose Your Own Adventure"" format available on the Special Edition DVD version released Tuesday July 25.MOVIE PREMISE: As a group of friends are about to get on a rollercoaster, one of them, Wendy, suddenly has a vision of the rollercoaster malfunctioning, and everyone onboard dying. After Wendy begins to panic and tries desperately to warn all those on board, she gets off the coaster, along with a few others. After the coaster crashes just as she predicted, strange things begin to happen to all those who deboarded the doomed coaster. Death will not be avoided for long. After realizing the pictures she had taken with her digital camera that night held clues to the terrifyingly gruesome ways in which each person was going to die...Wendy and her friend/fellow doomed survivor Ryan, try desperately to warn all those who escaped the accident. They realize that each person is being killed in the order that they sat on the rollercoaster...in the order they were meant to die.On the DVD, once you click on ""Play Movie"", you will be given the option of watching the theatrical release version of the film, OR....watching the movie in Choose-your-own-adventure style (which they call ""Choose Their Fate""). If you choose the latter (which certainly makes things more interesting), then the movie will pause at key points in the film and give you two choices that will directly effect the way the film progresses.For Example:...A flip of a coin will decide where your boyfriend will sit on the coaster. Do you A.) Call Heads, or B.) Call Tails?...A huge sign is about to fall on top of a man and crush him to death...does he A.) dive to the left, or B.) dive to the right?...Your friend specifically asks you *not* to look at his picture and possibly foresee the way in which he'll soon die. Do you A.) take another look anyway, or B.) do as he asks and don't look.Each choice you make has a very specific effect. Some choices will either save a character...or condemn them to a gruesome death. Some choices can't save a character...but they alter the way in which that character dies. Some choices will even end the film early!It's a new and very fun feature that I've never seen done before, and regardless of the fact that some people feel the ""Final Destination"" movies have become a little formulaic...it's still worth checking out and having a go at deciding each character's fate.HELPFUL HINT/SPOILER: When watching the film ""Choose Their Fate"" style...I recommend that when it comes time to make your first choice (which will be a coin toss...Heads or Tails), that you choose Heads. If you choose Tails, the movie will end almost immediately afterwards and you will not have a chance to see the rest of it play out. Choosing Heads will take you forward with the film...the rest is up to you!Also...when making your choices...choose wisely and FAST. If you wait longer than a few seconds to make your choice, then Fate will choose for you.

987946,A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ,B000FC2HRW,Chris Kennison,"[0, 0]","There's something to be said about the FINAL DESTINATION 3 series. Strangely enough, most trilogies of the horror genre lose their production value and strength of character. Yet, instantly I was struck by the quality of the production.Honestly, the FINAL DESTINATION movies are REALLY one dimensional. There's no Freddy, Jason or Michael. There's an invisible force. A myth of death. A myth of when it's your time, it's your time and death will get you one way or the other.So there's no funny Freddy lines or chases. No scary faces. There aren't even any scary moments. Just... death scenes. Sort of like watching a fictionalized FACES OF DEATH. Sorta morbid now that I think about it. Yet, the characters are engaging, especially the lead character Wendy, played by relative newbie Mary Elizabeth Winstead (Ring 2 & Sky High).The most noteable thing, as I've already mentioned, is the production value. The MONSTER ROLLERCOASTER scene is very cool. Never in my life has a movie rollercoaster scene gave me that artificial feeling in the gut like being on a real rollercoaster, but, although not a huge effect, I sort of felt it in this movie. They took a regular and small theme park rollercoaster and CG'd a MONSTER ROLLERCOASTER and it's very effective. It looked incredibly high.It doesn't stop there.

After the release of FD2 which was pretty subpar compared to the first one, I wasn't expecting a whole lot from the third installment. To my surprise, the producers of the first movie came back to do FD3, plus they brought in some good actors to which added a lot more depth to the characters.While FD3 doesn't veer from the typical storyline of the FD franchise, it does dispatch the characters in new and oftentimes in a ""graphic novel"" way. Moreover, the end of this one tops the other two movies as well.Overall FD3 is a movie to have a lot of fun with (if you're a thriller/horror fan).",3,A Gory Good Time (3.5 stars),1211673600,"05 25, 2008",2008,649,"['first', 'few', 'times', 'watched', 'FD3', 'was', 'pretty', 'skeptical', 'release', 'FD2', 'was', 'pretty', 'subpar', 'compared', 'first', 'one', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'whole', 'lot', 'third', 'installment', 'surprise', 'producers', 'first', 'movie', 'came', 'back', 'do', 'FD3', 'brought', 'good', 'actors', 'added', 'lot', 'more', 'depth', 'characters.While', 'FD3', ""n't"", 'veer', 'typical', 'storyline', 'FD', 'franchise', 'dispatch', 'characters', 'new', 'oftentimes', 'graphic', 'novel', 'way', 'Moreover', 'end', 'one', 'other', 'two', 'movies', 'well.Overall', 'FD3', 'movie', 'have', 'lot', 'fun', ""'re"", 'thriller/horror', 'fan']",N/A
987948,A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B000FC2HRW,"Cloud ""...""","[1, 3]","Horror films come in 2 flavors: gory and over-the-top as possible, or psychological thrillers. Well you can obviously tell what Final Destination 3 is going to be right? Despite the contrivances, these films always offered the best gore-filled deaths around and this film doesn't skimp on it either. One thing you'll always love about these films is the gorefest involved, where it almost becomes giddyness when somebody gets off very gruesomely. It'll make you question your sanity at seeing such scenes but boy it's fun!A soon-to-be graduating class is out at the fairground and decide to get on a high rollercoaster. Wendy (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), yearbook student and self-described control freak, has a premonition where the rollercoaster kills everyone in it so she freaks out and people get off the ride but the ride still continues, leaving her boyfriend and best friend on. The crash goes according to plan and Wendy finds herself trying to save everyone's life when Death is after everyone who get off the ride and he's kinda ticked and dispatches them in gruesome ways.While bloodwise you would probably say the second one was the biggest, the third is arguably the most creative. Characters die in gruesomely bloody fashion and we get to see it. However there is one slight nitpick: they're a bit too elaborate. Instead of just a simple accident or a bad case of wrong place/wrong time, Death now is playing Mousetrap: Rube Goldberg-like scenarios where one thing knocks over another thing which turns on another thing that shorts another thing and it just goes until the character dies. It becomes a bit silly, and plus there is one big plothole: that of somebody's video camera. But there is some effective deaths including a nailgun and a tanning salon. But the tension for some reason gets kind of lost since Wendy, thanks to photographs she took night of the rollercoaster crash which contains clues to character demises, is aware of how everyone dies and it doesn't become as much a shock. See the glass pane boy from part 2 compared to tanning salon here: we're aware something nasty is going to happen in there and you end up almost waiting for the carnage.Acting-wise of course it's not the strongest although anything terrible makes it slightly better with Mary Elizabeth Winstead who manages to at least give some weight to what is essentially a plotless script (not to mention she's my new actress crush since, not only is she quite adept at acting but there's such a natural beauty about her). Everyone else though is not quite as stellar. Each one has 2 moods: their basic attitude towards everything (the jock who's kind of a jerk, the ditzy ""like oh my gawd"" mall wenches) and the disbelieving attitude they have when Wendy comes up to them and rants they're going to die.Extras-wise it's quite nice as we get a commentary with director James Wong and co-writer Glen Morgan, an almost hour-and-a-half long documentary about the film with some weirdly funny bits (for some reason, I got such a kick out of ""chunky goodness""), a featurette about the dead teenager movie genre with discussion from historians and Roger Ebert and others. There is one weird addition and that is the ""Choose Your Fate"" version. Basically at certain points, the screen morphs into a screen where you can make a decision about an action a character can make in the film. It's a neat idea since you get to see more footage (and for me, more Winstead) but it's kind of a hassle since some decisions like the very first one inadvertedly stops the film really early while another is basically the same death just with one minor detail added. Also, if you watch the theatrical version, those moments cause a slight pause in some players.Unlike such films as Hostel or the Hills Have Eyes which were just pointless gore with a story that's going nowhere and taken too seriously, the Final Destination films know what kind of film it's going to be and does so with gusto. That of a gore galore film where you almost feel disturbed about how much of a kick you're getting out of characters getting the axe (figuratively though).",3,By all accounts...I should've hated this,1155686400,"08 16, 2006",2006,4126,"['Horror', 'films', 'come', '2', 'flavors', 'gory', 'over-the-top', 'possible', 'psychological', 'thrillers', 'can', 'obviously', 'tell', 'what', 'Final', 'Destination', '3', 'going', 'be', 'right', 'contrivances', 'films', 'always', 'offered', 'best', 'gore-filled', 'deaths', 'film', ""n't"", 'skimp', 'One', 'thing', ""'ll"", 'always', 'love', 'films', 'gorefest', 'involved', 'where', 'almost', 'giddyness', 'when', 'somebody', 'off', 'very', 'gruesomely', ""'ll"", 'make', 'question', 'sanity', 'seeing', 'such', 'scenes', 'boy', 'fun', 'soon-to-be', 'graduating', 'class', 'out', 'fairground', 'decide', 'get', 'high', 'rollercoaster', 'Wendy', 'Mary', 'Elizabeth', 'Winstead', 'student', 'self-described', 'control', 'freak', 'premonition', 'where', 'rollercoaster', 'everyone', 'out', 'people', 'get', 'ride', 'ride', 'still', 'leaving', 'boyfriend', 'best', 'friend', 'crash', 'according', 'plan', 'Wendy', 'trying', 'save', 'everyone', 'life', 'when', 'Death', 'everyone', 'who', 'get', 'ride', 'kinda', 'ticked', 'dispatches', 'gruesome', 'ways.While', 'bloodwise', 'would', 'probably', 'say', 'second', 'one', 'was', 'biggest', 'third', 'arguably', 'most', 'creative', 'Characters', 'die', 'gruesomely', 'bloody', 'fashion', 'get', 'see', 'However', 'one', 'slight', 'nitpick', ""'re"", 'bit', 'too', 'elaborate', 'Instead', 'just', 'simple', 'accident', 'bad', 'case', 'wrong', 'place/wrong', 'time', 'Death', 'now', 'playing', 'Mousetrap', 'Rube', 'Goldberg-like', 'scenarios', 'where', 'one', 'thing', 'over', 'thing', 'thing', 'thing', 'just', 'character', 'bit', 'silly', 'one', 'big', 'plothole', 'somebody', 'video', 'camera', 'effective', 'deaths', 'including', 'nailgun', 'tanning', 'salon', 'tension', 'reason', 'kind', 'lost', 'Wendy', 'thanks', 'photographs', 'took', 'night', 'rollercoaster', 'crash', 'clues', 'character', 'demises', 'aware', 'how', 'everyone', ""n't"", 'become', 'as', 'much', 'shock', 'See', 'glass', 'pane', 'boy', 'part', '2', 'compared', 'tanning', 'salon', 'here', ""'re"", 'aware', 'something', 'nasty', 'going', 'happen', 'there', 'end', 'up', 'almost', 'waiting', 'carnage.Acting-wise', 'course', 'not', 'strongest', 'anything', 'terrible', 'slightly', 'better', 'Mary', 'Elizabeth', 'Winstead', 'who', 'least', 'give', 'weight', 'what', 'essentially', 'plotless', 'script', 'not', 'mention', 'new', 'actress', 'crush', 'not', 'only', 'quite', 'adept', 'acting', 'natural', 'beauty', 'Everyone', 'else', 'not', 'quite', 'stellar', 'one', '2', 'moods', 'basic', 'attitude', 'towards', 'everything', 'jock', 'who', 'kind', 'jerk', 'ditzy', 'oh', 'gawd', 'mall', 'wenches', 'disbelieving', 'attitude', 'have', 'when', 'Wendy', 'up', 'rants', ""'re"", 'going', 'die.Extras-wise', 'quite', 'nice', 'get', 'commentary', 'director', 'James', 'Wong', 'co-writer', 'Glen', 'Morgan', 'almost', 'hour-and-a-half', 'long', 'documentary', 'film', 'weirdly', 'funny', 'bits', 'reason', 'got', 'such', 'kick', 'chunky', 'goodness', 'featurette', 'dead', 'teenager', 'movie', 'genre', 'discussion', 'historians', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'others', 'one', 'weird', 'addition', 'Choose', 'Fate', 'version', 'Basically', 'certain', 'points', 'screen', 'morphs', 'screen', 'where', 'can', 'make', 'decision', 'action', 'character', 'can', 'make', 'film', 'neat', 'idea', 'get', 'see', 'more', 'footage', 'more', 'Winstead', 'kind', 'hassle', 'decisions', 'very', 'first', 'one', 'inadvertedly', 'film', 'really', 'early', 'basically', 'same', 'death', 'just', 'one', 'minor', 'detail', 'added', 'Also', 'watch', 'theatrical', 'version', 'moments', 'cause', 'slight', 'pause', 'players.Unlike', 'such', 'films', 'Hostel', 'Hills', 'Have', 'Eyes', 'were', 'just', 'pointless', 'gore', 'story', 'going', 'nowhere', 'taken', 'too', 'seriously', 'Final', 'Destination', 'films', 'know', 'what', 'kind', 'film', 'going', 'be', 'so', 'gusto', 'gore', 'galore', 'film', 'where', 'almost', 'feel', 'disturbed', 'how', 'much', 'kick', ""'re"", 'getting', 'characters', 'getting', 'axe', 'figuratively']",N/A

You are not getting Citizen Kane here folks!  You get what you're being offered, and this is a teen slasher flick.  They are my guilty pleasure, and I enjoyed watching the first two movies and had a blast with this one as well.  This is a good standalone from the first two flicks, which means that you can watch it even if you hadn't given the first two a whirl (though I recommend that you do).  For those who watched Final Destination 1 and 2 are familiar with the plot: kids are headed for a ride (plane, car, this time a rollercoaster), one of them gets a premonition and he/she, along with several others, gets out just in time.  But then the ones who got off their bloody fates begin to die in mysterious and graphic ways in the order in which they would have died in the premonition.  It is up to the protagonist to stop the deaths, or at least try to save herself/himself before it's his or her turn.The third part of the trilogy features high school seniors about to graduate.  Wendy (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) gets signs and a clear as day premonition of what would happen if she gets on the rather sinister-looking rollercoaster.  Well, everything else is pretty predictable, for the plot doesn't change from the first two films.  The actors are all young and attractive.  They're not the best actors in the world, but I haven't seen very many horror flicks with Oscar-caliber performances.  The fun of this film is watching how the characters die.  There is a lot of decapitations in this one, that's for sure!  They are less creative or surprising than in the first two Final Destinations, but, as said earlier, you already pretty much know what to expect.  The thing I like about this one is that Wendy (Winstead) looks genuinely distressed and spooked during the death scenes.  Also, the screen writer, editor and director are smart enough to let time pass in between deaths so that the characters adjust to what they had seen and experienced.  I hated the detached way in which the characters in the earlier movies reacted when someone died right in front of them, as if to say, ""Eeww, gross!  Okay, who's next?""  So unrealistic!  Speaking of unrealistic, why does the protagonist get a premonition if he/she and the others are meant to die that day?  Did they possess these powers BEFORE the horrible occurrence?  Is the Grim Reaper a sadist who wants to play a game of cat and mouse?  Total suspension of disbelief, like in all of these flicks, is necessary.  Then again, this is a teen horror flick.  Since when do these movies make sense?  I mean, Jason from Friday the 13th died when he was a kid, and then he reemerges a grown man with a hockey mask and an insatiable bloodlust. So... just watch and enjoy! (Okay, I could have done without the gratuitous topless scene at the tanning salon, but I bet the men loved THAT!)The DVD is good.  The widescreen edition (2:35 format) is better than the previous films, which had a 1:85 format.  I also liked the features.  The choose the fates and deaths thing is a good addition for die-hard fans.  I would recommend buying the set that includes all three movies if you don't already have them.  They are more of a bargain when bought together.  Plus you'll get to have a good time with your friends -- watching three movies while admitting that you actually enjoy this kind of stuff.

987950,A25ZVI6RH1KA5L,B000FC2HRW,"cookieman108 ""cookieman108""","[19, 27]","Interesting characters, an engaging story, and bizarre, intricately orchestrated death scenes...these were the three main elements I took away from the original Final Destination (2000)...after watching Final Destination 3 (2006) last night, it seems only one of the three elements I mentioned made it to the third installment (I'll give you a hint...it wasn't the interesting characters or engaging story).  Co-written and directed by James Wong (""The X Files"", Final Destination, The One), the film stars Mary Elizabeth Winstead (The Ring Two, Sky High) and Ryan Merriman (Halloween: Resurrection, The Ring Two).  Also appearing is Amanda Crew (She's the Man), who looks a heck of a lot like the singer Tiffany, Kris Lemche (Ginger Snaps), Sam Easton (Underclassman), Alexz Johnson (""Instant Star""), Jesse Moss (""Whistler""), Gina Holden (The Butterfly Effect 2), Chelan Simmons (Dr. Dolittle 3), Crystal Lowe (Scary Movie 4), and Texas Battle (Coach Carter), which is about one of the goofiest names I've heard in awhile, but whatever...As the film begins we see a group of seniors from McKinley High at an amusement park and we end up focusing on two couples, Wendy `Wen' Christensen (Winstead), Jason `J' Wise (Moss), Kevin Fischer (Merriman), and Carrie Dreyer (Holden).  Eventually the foursome head towards the mammoth roller coaster called Satan's Armpit (or something like that), but Wendy, who's on the yearbook committee and has been snapping pictures all night long (this is a key aspect later on) gets a bad feeling...if you've seen the previous two films then you'll probably guess she's got `the sight', in that she gets an ookie feeling when bad things are about to happen.  Anyway, if you've seen the first film, picture in place of a plane a roller coaster, as disaster strikes taking a handful of teens (Wendy had a serious freak out while sitting in the coaster, eventually leading to a number of teens not taking the ride of death).  Okay, so if I've learned anything from the previous two films it's that you cannot cheat death, and sure enough those who got off the coaster begin getting picked off in particularly horrible ways...emollition, decapitation, electrocution, impalement, and so on...and guess what?  Not only does Wendy have an idea of who's next to go, but she also has clues to how they're going to die, said clues found in the very photos she took the night of the disaster.  All she has to do now is convince those who are next on death's hit list before they bite it, which is kind of difficult given few, if any, truly believe her, at least until it's too late...I signed on for this ride with my main expectation being to see a lot of really nasty, violent death sequences, as found in the previous films, and I wasn't disappointed in that aspect.  The biggest problems I had with the film was both the actual story and characters seemed flat and relatively uninteresting.  The most interesting character for me also happened to be the sleaziest, one named Frankie Cheeks (Easton), the socially retarded creepy guy who graduated a couple of years earlier but still hangs out at high school functions hoping to score with some underage babes who might be dense enough to fall for his game (every class had someone like this).  As far as the rest of the characters, I honestly didn't care for any of them one way or another, and saw them as nothing but fodder for the meat grinder...there really wasn't any performances that stuck out, but there are some pretty comical lines thrown about, one in particular that featured Wendy and Kevin.  Kevin didn't want to see his actual `death picture', but he did ask Wendy for some sort of confirmation that it didn't involve him going out in an embarrassing way, with something getting rammed up his rear portal.  If I had to pick the most painful death sequence from the film I think I'd have to go with the one connected to the sun tanning beds, only because it was the most drawn out, the with nail gun incident at the hardware store a close second.  As far as the rest, I won't go into detail, but they are gruesome and visceral, and usually occur as the result of a lengthy build up.  Perhaps this is where the most fun is, as while you're watching events unfold, you're trying to figure out where it's all leading to in terms of how the person involved is going to get it...I learned a number of things from this film, including the following...1. When the roller coaster you're riding on starts emitting showers of sparks, that's a sure sign something is wrong.2. Wheels are an essential part to a roller coaster operating properly.3. Roller coasters apparently don't have any sensors to detect the loss of hydraulics, causing the ride to shut down automatically as a safety feature.4. The Grim Reaper seems partial to deaths caused by massive head injuries, particularly in those whom escaped his grasp through the intervention of another.5. High school girls sure like to show their mid-drifts.6. Those bubble headed bimbos sure were dumb, but they had some nice mams.7. Never frequent a tanning salon operated by a Russian guy as if something goes wrong, he won't be around, having accidentally locked himself of the building by gabbing with his girlfriend on his cell phone.8. Loose shelving, Big Gulps, and tanning beds don't mix.9. Nail guns are effective against pigeons (and people).10. The Grim Reaper is vindictive as hell, especially towards those whom escaped his grasp through the intervention of another, so much so he creates exceptionally elaborate Rube Goldberg-esque scenarios that result in hideous deaths.11. Lockers rooms are very dangerous places, especially those occupied by jocks soaked with testosterone (and most likely steroids).12. Goth couples have cutesy nicknames for each other, like Zip and Pip (blech).13. Anytime the wind blows, the lights dim, and the radio in your car goes nutty, that's a sure sign someone is going to die horribly.14. Good luck charms ain't worth diddly spit when death comes a callin'.15. You can't cheat death, but you can really tick him off.As I said, there isn't much in the way of story or characters, but if you dig on bizarre, visceral death sequences, then you enjoy this film.  Also, Wong does keep things moving along well as the hour and a half run time went by very quickly.  All in all a whole lot of flash (and blood), but not much substance...was I expecting more?  Not really, but it would have been nice, especially with Wong, who was behind the original Final Destination, at the helm.I won't bother mentioning all the extras included on this two disc DVD release as the Amazon site does that well enough, but I will say the picture, presented in widescreen (2.35:1) anamorphic, and the audio, available in Dolby Digital 5.1 EX Surround, DTS-ES 6.1 Discrete, and Dolby Digital Surround, both come across immaculately.  Also, there's two versions of the film here...one being the standard, theatrical release, and a second that allows for some interaction in that at certain points in the film in that the viewer gets to make choices for the actors (resulting in them doing one of two actions), thereby altering the story slightly (maybe they die, maybe they don't...maybe they die a different way then originally depicted).Cookieman108",3,"""So what, is he going to get crushed by a giant SpongeBob?""",1154044800,"07 28, 2006",2006,7301,"['Interesting', 'characters', 'engaging', 'story', 'bizarre',

The characters, too, are a bit lovable, as opposed to the annoying characters in the first two ""Final Destination"" films.""FD3"", though, is a sequel on its own.

Where it goes downhill is in handling the logic of its premise.  It's bad enough that there's the completely gratuitous nudity in the tanning bed death scene, and the absurd exageration of the nail gun accident.  (What kind of nail is long enough for an exit wound??)  What bugs me is that the roller coaster accident, which is supposed to start things off, simply doesn't make sense.  Was it caused by the idiot with the video camera?  If so, why did it still happen when said idiot got off?  And how did the track just happen to be damaged in the path of the out-of-control car, without being noticed by park maintenance OR causing another accident first?

The original film presented a youthful but talented cast. It also offered a remarkably original premise injected with a bit of dark humor. Quite a treat! Moreover, while ""Final Destination 2"" had a thinner plot, the technical effects were completely unexpected -- utterly groundbreaking. The mature casting granted the film an interesting sense of plausibility. So phenomenal a visual-spectacle is the second installment of this film that I shared it with my film-studies class! Now for ""Final Destination 3""... Not only are the actors ridiculously inexperienced (this is the first foray into acting for some...and it shows!), they seem to be entirely unaware of their less-than-mediocre talents. This is not a problem of editing, this a serious problem with casting. These actors literally have their foundation in television-acting (check the bios) ... and we are talking bad, bad cable acting (or the CW). The talent is so heinous that that viewer hopes for these actors deaths (not because he/she craves the brutality, but merely as a relief from the ""acting""). But, and here is the worst crime the film commits, the deaths are ineffective. The problem: they lack creativity. The first two installments of this franchise used viewer-misdirection to shock its audience with appalling death-scenes. In this instance, the deaths are both predictable and obvious. A tremendous disappointment, indeed.And, for those ""Final Destination"" fans who think they are going to see a slightly dumbed-down echo of the first two films. ... think REALLY dumbed-down. The grotesque caricatures of teens, the crass/vulgar humor, the gratuitous nudity, and the excruciating writing was shocking. It is unusual to see a director deliberately disregard a film's cult-following. Not only did Wong ignore the intended audience for the film, but he insulted them.For all horror enthusiasts: be prepared to walk-away from the film angry ... and it's not just the SLOPPY, SLOPPY conclusion.

987967,ALR1CN6DL50DA,B000FC2HRW,Felixpath,"[3, 3]","Ah, ""Final Destination"" movies.....a guilty pleasure if ever there was one. The third film in the franchise follows closely in the footsteps of its predecessors, creating a predictable thrill ride of ominous signs, paranoia, desperation, and gruesomely inventive deaths. The deaths are really what it's all about. The FD films are standard Dead Teenager Movies that try to pretend they're more high-class via an inspired gimmick: instead of being eaten by some monster or hacked up by a psychopath, the young stars are killed by....(drumroll)....Fate Itself. Basically, Fate (or Death, or God, or whatever you want to call it) has a grand scheme, everyone dies at a set moment in time, and if you screw up the design by cheating Fate/Death/God, it will do its very best to correct the mistake by causing you to die, using whatever materials it finds handy, such as a speeding truck. Or a weight machine. Or a nail gun. The motto of these movies should be ""Proudly Searching for New Ways to Get Deep-Sixed.""In the first ""Final Destination,"" seven people were saved from an airplane crash when one kid had a ""vision"" of the tragedy...and then the survivors died anyway. That film had a fresh idea, a solid cast, and good dialogue that included some nice discussions about the nature of God and fate. ""Final Destination 2,"" which used a highway pileup as its main tragedy, had some great deaths but overdid it with the ridiculous plot twists and gimmickry. (""Hey, each one of us is somehow connected to one of the victims in the first film!"") Now comes the third film, which has a roller coaster crash, a prophetic digital camera, and one more twist: really, really annoying characters. While the teens in the first two films were likable enough, FD3's slew of survivors/victims seems drawn from a list of negative teenage stereotypes. Do we have a leering, perverted sleazebag? Yup, and he's played by Sam Easton. How 'bout a pair of airhead clickie girls (Chelan Simmons and Crystal Lowe)? An arrogant super-jock (Texas Battle)? A sarcastic Goth couple (Kris Lemche and Alexz Johnson)? All there. So the twist is that instead of feeling for these people, we eagerly await their deaths. And since the deaths are the heart of the franchise, this is mostly a good thing.Good thing the film's heroine is smart, nice, and sympathetic. Her name is Wendy (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), and he first see her at an amusement park with her boyfriend and the rest of their senior class, enjoying an end-of-school bash. She's taking photos for the yearbook, and takes so many in the film's first five minutes that we know this must be important somehow. She reluctantly allows the others to drag her onto the towering roller coaster, but right before the ride starts, she has a vivid, real-time vision of the coaster breaking and everyone on board -- herself included -- dying violent deaths. She panics and gets ejected from the ride, along with her best friend's boyfriend, Kevin (Ryan Merriman) and the aforementioned gang of bratzillas. Her best friend and boyfriend stay on the ride, and are killed when her vision comes true.And then, of course, the survivors start to die in accidents that make the roller coaster crash look humane. The first death scene, involving a tanning salon, is truly horrific, and also features enough bare breast footage to satisfy the male contingent of the audience. After that, it's the filmmakers trying to outdo themselves with blood, flesh fragments, and mayhem. Kevin reads about FD1's plane crash on the web, and Wendy checks the photos she took at the amusement park and realizes that they contain clues about how everyone will die. She and Kevin start trying to warn the others, but their classmates are too full of themselves. In FD2, all the characters joined forces to try and survive. Not here. The deaths become poetic justice for scoffing at the two lead characters. As for ""serious"" dialogue, the Kris Lemche character is the only one who really gets to wax philosophical about the whole death/fate concept, though his solution for cheating death is just plain cold. Adding to the fun is Julie (Amanda Crew), Wendy's little sister, who wasn't on the roller coaster but has enough screen time to let us know she'll be crucial later on. And there's always the chance that Fate/Death/God will suddenly change the rules on you. It rarely plays fair.FD3 tries to have the same slick, intellectual vibe as FD1, but it's a little too formulaic, a little too careless with its story. Wendy and Kevin's exploits seem more like a convenient way to get the characters to various cool-to-die-in locations. (A weight room! A home appliance warehouse! A tricentennial celebration!) The photography gimmick is nicely done, but it leads to an awkward moment when Wendy whips out a ""similar"" photo of the World Trade Center with the shadow of a plane projected onto one tower. The filmmakers obviously intended this to be a solemn statement about how our innocence has been lost in a post-9/11 world, but it comes across as cheap and tasteless. There's also a pointless subplot (copied from FD1) about a pair of cops who become mighty suspicious that these two teens are present at so many death scenes, but that little story dead-ends. And, like the first two films, FD3 has a mean-spirited downer of an ending. Apparently, the reward for triumphing over death is more of the same.The bottom line is that ""Final Destination 3"" is the right kind of film for watching on DVD, with a bunch of friends who can join you in groaning and cheering at the appropriate moments. Maybe you can make bets on how the next obnoxious teen will die. You can't make bets on WHO will die next, because any eight-year-old could figure that out during the opening credits. The first ""Final Destination,"" like the first ""Halloween"" and the first ""Friday the 13th"" and the first ""Nightmare On Elm Street,"" was a fresh horror concept that has spawned sequels that are pretty trashy, but still a lot of fun on a base level. And for those of you who angry that violent death is now considered entertaining, I should point out that there are many, many high-quality films that treat death with solemn dignity, and those films have my deepest respect. It's just that after the award-winning tragedy of the Brokeback Mountains and the Million Dollar Babies, I kind of need a film like ""Final Destination 3"" to unwind. Don't you?PS: The ""demon"" voice coming from the roller coaster is the voice of Tony Todd, who played the creepy mortician in the first two films.

987971,ANBQIWHO9JRFS,B000FC2HRW,General Zombie,"[5, 7]","Well, reviewing this is easy enough: If you saw and liked the first 2 'Final Destination' films, go see this one.  If not, don't.  That's about it, but I'll go on some more anyway.Major release horror movies are always bound to be a mixed bag, particularly because this kind of film leans towards theoretically fun horror movie rather than the, well, horrifying sort.  And this is definitely true of the 'Final Destination' films; it's hard to imagine anyone being terrified or disturbed by them provided they aren't a small child or a complete pansy.  I prefer serious horror films, generally, but this sorta thing can work too, and FD films are some of the best horror movies of this kind to come out in recent memory.  FD3 is certainly nothing more than reiteration, but the original ideas are amusing enough for another go round, and this one proves to probably be the best of the series.  (It's a tough call, though.  They're all in about the same range, quality-wise.)The premise is exactly the same as the previous two films:  A high schooler, Wendy, has a premonition of death just prior to riding on a roller coaster and flips out, causing herself and about half a dozen others to get off the ride.  The premonition, of course, comes true, and they're all spared.  But apparently Death isn't so pleased with this and proceeds to off them one by one in the order that they would've died during the accident all via bizarre, impossible coincidences and accidents, and  if you escape the trap Death passes you by and heads to the next person.  Wendy, as did the other FD protagonists, has premonitions of sorts regarding the impending deaths and, adding a new wrinkle to the plot, they also discover that the numerous pictures that they took prior to the roller coaster ride contain clues as to their future demises.  Thus, after the opening, the film is just a series of set pieces where they're killed via elaborate contraptions interspersed with scenes of them standing around and talking about how they're gonna die, and how that sucks and all.The film gets off to a somewhat slow start.  They probably spend too much time at the spooky carnival and the roller coaster crash itself proves to be fairly unimpressive.  A roller coaster disaster sounds good in theory, but I dunno how you're gonna actually shoot this effectively, and apparently Wong doesn't either.  It's okay as it is, but the disasters in the previous films were better, particularly the spectacularly over the top crash from FD2.Once it gets going it's better than ever before, however.  Wendy is probably the most likable protagonist in the series, though that's not much of a prize, and the most annoying characters are generally killed first.  Furthermore, they just generally spend less time standin' around and talking and more time gettin' killed.  The set pieces are the most consistently amusing and perhaps most elaborate ones yet in the series, though I won't discuss them too specifically as that would kinda ruin it.  (There's nothing quite as ridiculously amusing as the teacher death from 1 nor as great as the squishing from 2, but it's got wonderful consistency.)  The film is about as gory as mainstream horror gets, definitely on the level of FD2 if not higher and far surpassing the original. (Which sadly, had little gore to speak of.)  It's also got a few relatively original deaths, though I emphasize relatively, as there just isn't a whole lot more you can do to the human body that hasn't been done yet.  On top of the high gore quotient its also got probably the most painful, vicious deaths in the series, giving it a bit more visceral punch, though it's still a fairly light hearted affair, as far as horror films go. (Spoiler Alert: Particularly note the roasting via tanning beds and the chick receiving about half a dozen nails thru the back of the head from a disturbingly high powered nail gun. Ouch)Wong and Morgan wrote the film again, and it's got some of the old humorous touches from the original that didn't make it into the sequel, or weren't as affective and noticeable, anyway.  Overall, it's just a bit smarter and better written than 2, though that ain't exactly what you're looking for when you go to this sorta film.Sadly, Tony Todd (the Candyman) isn't back as the creepy mortician.  Sure, I thought his appearance in 2 was kinda silly and unnecessary, but once the pattern is established I figured they'd continue with it.  Too bad.  He is back, however, in a sufficiently appropriate role, I suppose.On a final, insignificant note, there's a scene where they look at a photo of the WTC supposedly just before 9/11 where there is a phantom shadow of an airplane on it.  (This is supposed to connect in with the idea that the photos can show how the deaths will occur.)  This is very amusing, as it will certainly offend plenty of whiny babies and it's surprising that they'd dare do this.  (I haven't the faintest idea why this would offend people, but I'm absolutely sure it will. If I really understood why something was offensive I'd be offended too.)  Anyway, good for them.  It's rare to see the film business not be cowardly, particularly for no good reason.Grade: B",4,"More of the same, but still fun",1139529600,"02 10, 2006",2006,5198,"['Well', 'reviewing', 'easy',

987972,ATZ1LTONGHOP6,B000FC2HRW,Genevieve Hayes,"[1, 1]","In my opinion, the original ""Final Destination"" was one of the best horror films to surface in the wave of post-""Scream"" horror films that emerged in the late 1990's. The idea of a group of teenagers ""cheating death"" and then having ""death"" come back to collect them was a great one and with all of the elaborate death sequences, it was extremely well executed (excuse the pun) too. Evidently, I wasn't the only person out there who thought this, because ""Final Destination 3"" is essentially just a remake of the first ""Final Destination"" and why would you remake something if the idea didn't have merit to begin with? Of course, since ""Final Destination 3"" is just a remake, why bother to watch it at all; why not just re-watch ""Final Destination""? The answer to that question depends on why you liked the first film to begin with.If you are looking for originality of plot, then don't bother with ""Final Destination 3"". It's not there. This film will just give you a 89 minute feeling of deja vu. However, if you want to see yet another series of gruesome and elaborate death sequences, then you've come to the right place. The death sequences in this instalment are even better than those in the previous two films, and in spite of myself, I found myself eagerly anticipating each new death. Guessing who would be the next victim and how they would die was fun and the 89 minutes of the film literally just vanished, I was so engrossed in it (something which I can't say about many films). I won't give away the details of any of the deaths, since that would spoil the fun, but if that's why you like this series, then you will definitely enjoy this film.",4,"Little originality, but who cares?",1211932800,"05 28, 2008",2008,1658,"['opinion', 'original', 'Final', 'Destination', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'horror', 'films', 'surface', 'wave', 'post-', 'Scream', 'horror', 'films', 'emerged', 'late', '1990', 'idea', 'group', 'teenagers', 'cheating', 'death', 'then', 'having', 'death', 'come', 'back', 'collect', 'was', 'great', 'one', 'elaborate', 'death', 'sequences', 'was', 'extremely', 'well', 'executed', 'pun', 'too', 'Evidently', 'was', ""n't"", 'only', 'person', 'who', 'thought', 'Final', 'Destination', '3', 'essentially', 'just', 'remake', 'first', 'Final', 'Destination', 'why', 'would', 'remake', 'something', 'idea', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'merit', 'begin', 'course', 'Final', 'Destination', '3', 'just', 'remake', 'why', 'bother', 'watch', 'why', 'not', 'just', 're-watch', 'Final', 'Destination', 'answer', 'question', 'why', 'liked', 'first', 'film', 'begin', 'are', 'looking', 'originality', 'plot', 'then', 'do', ""n't"", 'bother', 'Final', 'Destination', '3', 'not', 'there', 'film', 'will', 'just', 'give', '89', 'minute', 'feeling', 'deja', 'vu', 'However', 'want', 'see', 'yet', 'series', 'gruesome', 'elaborate', 'death', 'sequences', 'then', ""'ve"", 'come', 'right', 'place', 'death', 'sequences', 'instalment', 'are', 'even', 'better', 'previous', 'two', 'films', 'spite', 'found', 'eagerly', 'anticipating', 'new', 'death', 'Guessing', 'who', 'would', 'be', 'next', 'victim', 'how', 'would', 'die', 'was', 'fun', '89', 'minutes', 'film', 'literally', 'just', 'vanished', 'was', 'so', 'engrossed', 'something', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'many', 'films', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'details', 'deaths', 'would', 'spoil', 'fun', 'why', 'series', 'then', 'will', 'definitely', 'enjoy', 'film']",N/A

Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[1, 1]","The following pertains to the 2-disc dvd of Final Destination 3.Something must be wrong in Death's Department because here we go again, with a fresh batch of young soon-to-be-corpses who initially evades the Grim Reaper's grasp. This time, a group of McKinley High School's graduating class is saved from a horrible rollercoaster accident, thanks to a vision by student Wendy Christensen (Mary Elizabeth Winstead). Grieving for her boyfriend's passing (he didn't get off the ride), Wendy receives yet more unsettling premonitions, this time regarding the people who had disembarked from the ride. She and fellow survivor Kevin Fischer (Ryan Merriman), who had made her aware of the fate of Flight 180 (the first Final Destination), come to regard the ensuing deaths as something orchestrated by Death, who intends to pick up his lost strays. With a working knowledge of the order of demise of the rollercoaster survivors, Wendy and Kevin rush from victim to victim, attempting to circumvent Death's gruesome plans and, along the way, figure out a way to stave off their own deaths.You know, I really like this series. It's just fun, grisly, popcorn-scarfing entertainment. While there is a certain formula to these 3 flicks, Death's modus operandi - of demise-thru-accidental-means - forces the audience to piece together various clues furnished by Wendy's digital camera photos and try to anticipate the manner of the next victim's grisly extinction. I know I was suspiciously eyeing the most common, most innocent-looking household items to see how they could potentially become the convoluted vehicle of gory death. I also appreciate the fact that Death doesn't have a physical presence but, rather, an omnipresent one, which, to me, provides a more fearful and unpredictable ambiance.There's really not much to say about the forgettable, cliched characters, other than they were, more or less, what you expected in this kind of film. The two leads put in good, efficient work, but, really, in this genre, the acting efforts tend to be overlooked as the viewer, instead, would rather concentrate on the horror elements (unless the acting is truly horrendous, which also happens in this genre). Also somewhat amusing were the song selections played during several key sequences, which provided moments of delicious irony and foreshadowing. The tune the ditzy chicks were rocking to in their tanning beds made me chuckle nervously. I don't wanna give too much away about the various death scenes, except to say that they are all pretty gasp-inducing. Check out what happens at the drive-thru. Still, in my opinion, nothing yet tops the vicious ladder-slam on the noggin scene in the second Final Destination.Final Destination 3 has a BUNCH of special features. Disc 1 contains the widescreen theatrical version, as well as a nice treat: you can click on the interactive ""Choose Their Fate!"" version and change the course of the film and the fates of the characters. Disc 1 also offers a feature film commentary by the filmmakers, as well as DVD ROM/online features. Disc 2 includes the 10-part documentary ""Kill Shot: The Making of Final Destination 3"" (which submenu has ""Severed Pieces"" - 6 short f/x segments) and the ""Planned Accidents"" featurette - both of which delve behind the scenes of the film; the ""Dead Teenager Movie"" featurette - an in-depth look at the teenage horror sub-genre; ""It's All Around You"" - an original animated short; an extended police station scene; a theatrical trailer and tv spots.Final Destination 3 doesn't have a physical supernatural monster or a serial killer, systematically doing away with their victims. The series's antagonist, instead, is Death, not as a physical incarnation but, rather, as a palpable presence. Death is everywhere and subtly does his work thru seemingly ordinary methods. Thus, the ""kill zone"" is actually broader in scope, as Death could sneak up at you from anywhere and from anything and arrange your demise thru some seemingly natural means. That's probably the allure of these films: that the ways these folks get killed off could actually happen in real life, thru some freakish but still plausible accident. The movie also boasts a sly, macabre sense of humor, which hopefully will tickle your fancy. Coupled with an intense, dread-laden atmosphere and nicely executed special effects, this unassuming little horror film makes for a fun-filled 93 minutes. So, give it a chance, dear gorehound, do.",4,"""There is someone walking behind you.""",1158969600,"09 23, 2006",2006,4467,"['following', 'pertains', '2-disc', 'dvd', 'Final', 'Destination', '3.Something', 'must', 'be', 'wrong', 'Death', 'Department', 'here', 'go', 'again', 'fresh', 'batch', 'young', 'soon-to-be-corpses', 'who', 'initially', 'Grim', 'Reaper', 'grasp', 'time', 'group', 'McKinley', 'High', 'School', 'graduating', 'class', 'saved', 'horrible', 'rollercoaster', 'accident', 'thanks', 'vision', 'student', 'Wendy', 'Christensen', 'Mary', 'Elizabeth', 'Winstead', 'Grieving', 'boyfriend', 'passing', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'off', 'ride', 'Wendy', 'yet', 'more', 'unsettling', 'premonitions', 'time', 'regarding', 'people', 'who', 'had', 'disembarked', 'ride', 'fellow', 'survivor', 'Kevin', 'Fischer', 'Ryan', 'Merriman', 'who', 'had', 'made', 'aware', 'fate', 'Flight', '180', 'first', 'Final', 'Destination', 'come', 'regard', 'ensuing', 'deaths', 'something', 'orchestrated', 'Death', 'who', 'pick', 'up', 'lost', 'strays', 'working', 'knowledge', 'order', 'demise', 'rollercoaster', 'survivors', 'Wendy', 'Kevin', 'rush', 'victim', 'victim', 'attempting', 'circumvent', 'Death', 'gruesome', 'plans', 'way', 'figure', 'out', 'way', 'stave', 'off', 'own', 'deaths.You', 'know', 'really', 'series', 'just', 'fun', 'grisly', 'popcorn-scarfing', 'entertainment', 'certain', 'formula', '3', 'flicks', 'Death', 'modus', 'operandi', 'demise-thru-accidental-means', 'audience', 'piece', 'together', 'various', 'clues', 'furnished', 'Wendy', 'digital', 'camera', 'photos', 'try', 'anticipate', 'manner', 'next', 'victim', 'grisly', 'extinction', 'know', 'was', 'suspiciously', 'eyeing', 'most', 'common', 'most', 'innocent-looking', 'household', 'items', 'see', 'how', 'could', 'potentially', 'become', 'convoluted', 'vehicle', 'gory', 'death', 'also', 'appreciate', 'fact', 'Death', ""n't"", 'have', 'physical', 'presence', 'rather', 'omnipresent', 'one', 'more', 'fearful', 'unpredictable', 'ambiance.There', 'really', 'not', 'much', 'say', 'forgettable', 'cliched', 'characters', 'other', 'were', 'more', 'less', 'what', 'expected', 'kind', 'film', 'two', 'leads', 'put', 'good', 'efficient', 'work', 'really', 'genre', 'acting', 'efforts', 'tend', 'be', 'overlooked', 'viewer', 'instead', 'would', 'rather', 'concentrate', 'horror', 'elements', 'acting', 'truly', 'horrendous', 'also', 'genre', 'Also', 'somewhat', 'amusing', 'were', 'song', 'selections', 'played', 'several', 'key', 'sequences', 'provided', 'moments', 'delicious', 'irony', 'foreshadowing', 'tune', 'ditzy', 'chicks', 'were', 'rocking', 'tanning', 'beds', 'made', 'chuckle', 'nervously', 'do', ""n't"", 'wan', 'na', 'give', 'too', 'much', 'away', 'various', 'death', 'scenes', 'say', 'are', 'pretty', 'gasp-inducing', 'Check', 'out', 'what', 'drive-thru', 'Still', 'opinion', 'nothing', 'yet', 'vicious', 'ladder-slam', 'noggin', 'scene', 'second', 'Final', 'Destination.Final', 'Destination', '3', 'BUNCH', 'special', 'features', 'Disc', '1', 'widescreen', 'theatrical', 'version', 'as', 'well', 'nice', 'treat', 'can', 'click', 'interactive', 'Choose', 'Their', 'Fate', 'version', 'change', 'course', 'film', 'fates', 'characters', 'Disc', '1', 'also', 'feature', 'film', 'commentary', 'filmmakers', 'as', 'well', 'DVD', 'ROM/online', 'features', 'Disc', '2', '10-part', 'documentary', 'Kill', 'Shot', 'Making', 'Final', 'Destination', '3', 'submenu', 'Severed', 'Pieces', '6', 'short', 'f/x', 'segments', 'Planned', 'Accidents', 'featurette', 'delve', 'scenes', 'film', 'Dead', 'Teenager', 'Movie', 'featurette', 'in-depth', 'look', 'teenage', 'horror', 'sub-genre', 'original', 'animated', 'short', 'extended', 'police', 'station', 'scene', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'tv', 'spots.Final', 'Destination', '3', ""n't"", 'have', 'physical', 'supernatural', 'monster', 'serial', 'killer', 'systematically', 'doing', 'away', 'victims', 'series', 'antagonist', 'instead', 'Death', 'not', 'physical', 'incarnation', 'rather', 'palpable', 'presence', 'Death', 'everywhere', 'subtly', 'work', 'thru', 'seemingly', 'ordinary', 'methods', 'Thus', 'kill', 'zone', 'actually', 'broader', 'scope', 'Death', 'could', 'sneak', 'up', 'anywhere', 'anything', 'arrange', 'demise', 'thru', 'seemingly', 'natural', 'means', 'probably', 'allure', 'films', 'ways', 'folks', 'get', 'killed', 'off', 'could', 'actually', 'happen', 'real', 'life', 'thru', 'freakish', 'still', 'plausible', 'accident', 'movie', 'also', 'sly', 'macabre', 'sense', 'humor', 'hopefully', 'will', 'tickle', 'fancy', 'Coupled', 'intense', 'dread-laden', 'atmosphere', 'nicely', 'executed', 'special', 'effects', 'unassuming', 'little', 'horror', 'film', 'fun-filled', '93', 'minutes', 'So', 'give', 'chance', 'dear', 'gorehound', 'do']",N/A

""A New Yorker""","[3, 5]","I've always been a huge fan of the Final Destination series, mainly because it got me to look at the world in a whole new light. Granted, a slightly paranoid light, but a new light all the same. Any film capable of doing this deserves some recognition! The first and second were gory and brashy films, and didn't attempt to pretend they weren't, and the third followed the same route.The plot in itself was pretty thin, and the characters were really just people on a hit list, no strong characterization, but then, it wasn't needed! Some gratuitous amounts of gore, and a little nudity here and there and you have a film to waste away the boredom welling up inside you. The actors all do fine jobs, and the special effects are pretty much top-notch and the pace just moves along nicely. Directed by James Wong with style and a pace that hits the ground running, the film is very much like a roller coaster in its self - fast, packed full of laughs and most importantly full of frights.The film is essentially a remake of the first film only with a different cast, gorier deaths and a higher level of self awareness. But this is a rare case in which copying the original isn't a bad thing- it keeps that sense of inventiveness and wit that made the first one great. It may be a clone, but its a very good one!The 2 major bad points are: The CGI - It was pretty noticeable, and it did take away some of the magic of the Roller-coaster scene, in my opinion anyway, and secondly, it was way too short and there weren't enough deaths in it! That sounds a little demented, I know, but I actually found myself yearning for just a little more... but no.

Since they couldn't get him to come back they just made part 2 about someone else having a vision and death following those who survived a big highway wreck because of her. Then part 3 it has someone else having a vision of a big rollarcoaster accident. Then death follows whoever survived killing them in the order they would've in the accident. With the person who had the vision spending most of it figuring out who will die next.The stories are all pretty much the same but the writer has to be creative  with who will die and how. The death scenes are creative and bloody and the film is about as well made as the first. Part 2 was a little too hateful, gross and disturbing for me.

The death scenes which are the selling point of this series are great in this installment, a couple of my favs are when two girls have one intense tanning session shall we say and when a boy scaring some pigeons proves to be a big pane in the glass for a nearby construction worker. Both of these especially the tanning bed sequence are pretty gory.Its not as good as the first or even the second flick but this one is just as fun and by this point you really start rooting for death to just take all these people even the lead actors since death is the best part of these movies. **1/2 out of 4 stars.",4,Less story more gore... and it works.,1347148800,"09 9, 2012",2012,1198,"['amusement', 'park', 'friends', 'Wendy', 'Mary', 'Elizabeth', 'Winstead', 'Scott', 'Pilgrim', 'Vs', 'World', 'suddenly', 'vision', 'where', 'others', 'are', 'killed', 'roller', 'coaster', 'accident', 'when', 'malfunctions', 'plummets', 'tracks', 'high', 'ground', 'Naturally', 'death', 'begins', 'come', 'who', 'escaped', 'wheels', 'fate', 'gory', 'often', 'hilarious', 'fashion.In', 'comparison', 'first', 'two', 'especially', 'first', 'one', 'story', 'third', 'pretty', 'simple', 'acting', 'step', 'down', 'Mary', 'well', 'rest', 'cast', 'least', 'acceptable', 'death', 'scenes', 'are', 'selling', 'point', 'series', 'are', 'great', 'installment', 'couple', 'favs', 'are', 'when', 'two', 'girls', 'have', 'one', 'intense', 'tanning', 'session', 'shall', 'say', 'when', 'boy', 'scaring', 'pigeons', 'proves', 'be', 'big', 'pane', 'glass', 'nearby', 'construction', 'worker', 'especially', 'tanning', 'bed', 'sequence', 'are', 'pretty', 'gory.Its', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'first', 'even', 'second', 'flick', 'one', 'just', 'fun', 'point', 'really', 'start', 'rooting', 'death', 'just', 'take', 'people', 'even', 'lead', 'actors', 'death', 'best', 'part', 'movies', '**1/2', '4', 'stars']",N/A

So far, this is the only installment that I've seen. The script was written by Glen Morgan and James Wong. These two wrote scripts for The X Files. Wong also directs. The late Shirley Walker composed music for the film. Wendy(Mary Elizabeth Winstead) has a vision that she and her friends will die on a roller coaster. Wendy and her friends cheat death as the roller coaster malfunctions.As the story progresses, our protagonists are killed in a series of mishaps! Winstead is lovely and very good as Wendy. She adds texture and charm to a character that could have been dull. Chelan Simmons(from the TV movie It) plays a Paris Hilton-ish snob. Tony Todd(Night of the Living Dead, Star Trek Deep Space Nine) lends his voice to an ""animatronic devil"".There's two cool ""Goth"" kids in the film. The Final Destination 3 DVD has an extra feature where one can slightly alter the story. The ""9/11 Photo"" in the film was pretty tasteless! For a Hollywood movie made in 2006, the production values and special effects are solid.

I have never jolted out of my seats so much in the cinema so it's a literal 'theme park' ride if one was ever in need of a pun. The deaths scenes were gory to the bone, probably the most graphic for this keen horror/science fiction buff. The actors were believable & had turmoil.

In trying to figure out what is going on, the protagonist comes across the idea of a camera having caught premonitions of how the survivors will die.  Another twist is that she is not sure who all got off of the roller coaster and is now in danger.  This time photographs provide clues to how death will catch up to the survivors.Much of the film is just what you would expect with the lead trying to warn people of their impending doom and lots of Rube Goldberg-style accidents.  Some of the action feels a little more intense that in the other films.  Certainly the ending is original and not just a rehash of the first two.  There is also the nice added tension supplied by not knowing who all is on the list.  When the final riders are identified it adds another dimension to the film.All in all a pretty predictable film but with a pretty good ending.  If you liked the first two films then there is no reason not to like this film except familiarity.  The acting was a little better than in the first (couldn't stand the lead in that one) and some of the writing is a little tighter.

987993,AIFXFHO2N9WJB,B000FC2HRW,"Justice0309 ""Justice""","[0, 1]","With the release of two successful entries into the relatively new `Final Destination' series New Line Cinema was faced with a minor dilemma.  Continue releasing further entries into the series, and risk failure by creating sub-par movies, or quit while ahead and take pride in the fact that you released two successful and original horror films (a feat not easily obtained in today's modern movie age).  Plus the fact that both current installments were highly entertaining supernatural/horror thrillers that managed to avoid the clich&eacute;d pitfalls of most horror films, which led me to believe that New Line Cinema was playing things smarter with this series.  However, the appeal of strong box office returns always outweighs executive's better judgment in such matters.  When it was announced that ""Final Destination 3"" was being made, I was highly doubtful of the film being all that good, but I thought the same about the second movie and I was proven way wrong on that count.  So, I kept an open mind and awaited the release of the trailer to fill me in on the story for the third movie, and once the preview finished, I was fairly certain that this movie was not going to be as good as its predecessors.  But, I thought, since I had already seen the first two in the series and they were entertaining, I may as well see this one.  Of course I waited for DVD, I wasn't about to go pay 7.00 dollars to watch this movie, especially with an increasingly strong probability that it wouldn't be all that good.""Final Destination 3"" begins with a group of teenagers preparing for graduation and their lives beyond high school.  In this group you have, the bad boy, the popular girl, the hot chick(s), the outcast, and the jock, this group comprises your basic horror movie cast.  During a graduation celebration, the outcast named Wendy (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), has a vision of the roller coaster her and the rest of the group are preparing to ride crashing and killing all onboard.  Upon waking up from her vision, Wendy freaks out getting herself removed from the ride along with several others in the group and within moments of Wendy being removed the ride begins and all the events she had just witnessed in her vision come true.  All the people on board the ride, including a couple of her friends, are killed.  Wendy's prophetic episode prompts the bad boy of the group (Ryan Merriman) to do some research, and he discovers that she's not the first to have these visions, but also if history continues to repeat itself that all who got off the ride are still in danger as Death is looking to finish off what it began that dark night.So, how does a movie studio continue to churn out hit after hit within a movie franchise without leaving the audience feeling like they've seen it all before?  And when will they learn that a franchise has reached its peak, and they should quit while ahead?  For some franchises there may never be enough, for there is always a new way to reinvigorate the franchise; ""Batman Begins"" and ""007: Casino Royale"" would be prime examples.  But other franchises, primarily those of the horror genre, tend to overstay their welcome long after their franchise has peaked, and therefore fail to achieve hit after hit.  But that doesn't necessarily stop the studios from trying to find that special something to achieve box office gold yet again with a single series.  Examples for franchises that overstayed their welcome would be `Halloween', `Friday the 13th', and `A Nightmare on Elm Street'.  Sometimes movie studios know how to keep a good thing going for as long as they can, and then they know when to cut it off, so that profits won't taper off.  Dimension Films found huge success with their highly successful `Scream' trilogy, they also knew that past ""Scream 3"", the franchise would be entering that `overstayed welcome' territory, and that was a risk they didn't want to take.  So, have the powers-that-be at New Line Cinema managed to release another entertaining and profitable installment into a franchise or have they overstayed their welcome?Well, the answer is a mixture of both.  ""Final Destination 3"" was an entertaining chapter in the series, hopefully a final chapter, because though the movie was fun and kept my attention throughout, it made me feel a little too much of  `been there, done that'.  The characters were your typical horror cast of characters as I pointed out above, and the story felt a little too much like a rehash of the story from the first film, making the movie seem unoriginal for a franchise that had succeeded in being original.  Even though I have my gripes about this third chapter in the `Final Destination' series, I still liked it, though not as much as the first two.  The death scenes were inventive and original enough, without being over-the-top and gory.  The cast was fairly solid, the movie could have definitely benefited from a veteran actor or two.  It was nice to see that the series remembers its roots and references events from the first two films to link the proceedings together, but this also served as a reminder as to how unoriginal this installment was.  The biggest problem ""Final Destination 3"" had, aside from lack of originality (which was bound to happen in a series like this), was that New Line didn't appear to try as hard with this movie, and the story proceeded along in a rather predictable manner.  With all that being said, the movie as I stated earlier in the paragraph, was still entertaining, and would serve as a decent ending to the franchise.  Because, in my opinion, any further entries would be an example of overstaying one's welcome, and I hope New Line is smart enough to figure that out.""Final Destination 3"" is rated R for violence,

987995,A16BGN07JEN0TE,B000FC2HRW,"Kalyon ""Steven""","[1, 2]","Final Destrination 3 is a very intense and gruesome movie.  I did enjoy it, bit there was my disappointments.  When the movie finished I though that if there wasn't the first two Final Destinations then this movie could stand alone.  All it was in the end was new characters in a different situation.  No new surprise, theme or plot change.  If you haven't seen the first two, you can watch this movie without being confused or missing information.  You'll understand everything.  The only time it refers to the other movies is once and it's the first Final Destination.  The crash and deathtraps are what I was looking forward to the most.  Overall, I was upset with the roller coaster crash and most of the killings didn't get to me.  When watching the coaster crash I wasn't into it as I was with the car accident in FD2.  My mouth was opened the whole time during that scene in Final Destination 2 because it was so intense.  With FD3, not even a reaction that made me think that I shouldn't get on a roller coaster for awhile.  For those who have seen it, how did the video camera that got dropped get hooked onto the track the way it did?  I'm pretty sure the strap from the camera couldn't do that.  Now for the deaths.  I was thinking since the same director and writer was doing this movie it was going to be interesting, more Rube Golberg crafted.  I was wrong.  The only death that comes into mind from FD3, which is my favorite from this movie, is the hardware store death.  It reminded me of the best killing out of the three movies, Miss Lewton's death.  It was crafted extremely well and that's what I was hoping for.  That's what made Final Destination intense.  You didn't know what was going to kill her.  In FD3, you could predict what was going to happen.  The pictures kind of helped, which was a new element to the movie instead of everyday signs.  I think the filmakers just wanted the movie to be more gory this time and not worry on how the victims die.  It was also very confusing at times because things would happen so fast that you couldn't tell what and how they were killed.  The workout scene in peticular just had me confused.  Where did those metal blocks come from?In the end as an FD fan I liked it.  But we all know that Final Destination was the best one.  FD3 is my second favorite, then FD2 at the end.

James Wong had taken steps through the horror genre and slashers and presented to us something new, fun and entertaining. Final Destination 3 however is quite similar to the second in the series. As you probably know by now, each of the Final Destination films start off with a tragic accident that begins only as a premonition at first. This time its a roller coaster accident. Probably the least impressive of all three. The ones who get off the roller coaster believe they are the lucky ones. They are wrong. Basically, you probably already know the story from here as all three installments are basically the same. Death stalks them, killing each of them in the order they would have died on the roller coaster. So what do we have here? To be honest I dont think we have much. It does give us a good deal of gruesome death scenes. But to think of it, this is all this film has. This film stands along side the second installment in the series, depending too much on the blood and gore, getting the thrill out of a gruesome death scene when afterwards it leads us straight to another one. Sure it may be a little fun but also a little pointless. We can deal with something a little more meaningful than that. We are not actually depending on blood and gore for horror to be successful. James Wong has done much better with the first, but created a so-so sequel thats on the same level as the second.",2,Horror doesnt depend on Blood and Gore,1155081600,"08 9, 2006",2006,1498,"['never', 'actually', 'took', 'much', 'interest', 'film', 'first', 'one', 'was', 'great', 'not', 'spectacular', 'James', 'Wong', 'had', 'taken', 'steps', 'horror', 'genre', 'slashers', 'presented', 'something', 'new', 'fun', 'entertaining', 'Final', 'Destination', '3', 'however', 'quite', 'similar', 'second', 'series', 'probably', 'know', 'now', 'Final', 'Destination', 'films', 'start', 'tragic', 'accident', 'only', 'premonition', 'first', 'time', 'roller', 'coaster', 'accident', 'Probably', 'least', 'impressive', 'three', 'ones', 'who', 'get', 'roller', 'coaster', 'believe', 'are', 'lucky', 'ones', 'are', 'wrong', 'Basically', 'probably', 'already', 'know', 'story', 'here', 'three', 'installments', 'are', 'basically', 'same', 'Death', 'stalks', 'killing', 'order', 'would', 'have', 'died', 'roller', 'coaster', 'what', 'do', 'have', 'here', 'be', 'honest', 'dont', 'think', 'have', 'much', 'give', 'good', 'deal', 'gruesome', 'death', 'scenes', 'think', 'film', 'film', 'along', 'side', 'second', 'installment', 'series', 'depending', 'too', 'much', 'blood', 'gore', 'getting', 'thrill', 'gruesome', 'death', 'scene', 'when', 'afterwards', 'straight', 'one', 'Sure', 'may', 'be', 'little', 'fun', 'also', 'little', 'pointless', 'can', 'deal', 'something', 'little', 'more', 'meaningful', 'are', 'not', 'actually', 'depending', 'blood', 'gore', 'horror', 'be', 'successful', 'James', 'Wong', 'done', 'much', 'better', 'first', 'created', 'so-so', 'sequel', 'thats', 'same', 'level', 'second']",N/A
987997,A2RKI7RPP5CJMG,B000FC2HRW,"K. Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!""","[0, 0]","I really enjoyed the first two ""Final Destination"" flicks.  The original was exactly that--original.  Having Death go after those who cheated him was a very good idea.  The second film, bringing back Ali Larter and (in a minor role) Tony Todd, managed to keep my attention very well.  The kills were a bit more extravagant and the pacing was excellent.With ""Final Destination 3,"" however, this rollercoaster has lost some steam.  Granted, the kills in this film were just as fun and intricately built as in the other two films, but it lacked characters that you could actually pull for.  Wendy, played by Mary Elizabeth Winstead, is the closest to an actual hero that the viewer would have any emotion for.The rest of the characters, played by remotely recognizable Ryan Merriman, Kris Lemche, a dude who's actually named Texas Battle, goth-girl wannabe Alexz Johnson (the ""x"" at the end of her name makes her cool) and a slew of other unknowns, do a decent job of standing around looking brooding, hot, athletic, or whatever else their stereotyped character is supposed to be.In case you're wondering about the plot, it's the same as the other two flicks.  Wendy has a premonition about a rollercoaster ride going insanely bad and her actions cause a few other people to miss the ride.  Death then goes after them, killing them off in the order they would have died on the coaster.  The rest of the story is spent showing us how gory and intricate the deaths can become.Something was missing here.  Perhaps it's just the fact that this is the third installment of the series and it's become boring.  Maybe it was the lack of a character you'd want to see actually survive to the end.  I don't know, but I have to say that despite the film's being boring, it moved at an excellent pace.  I was forty-five minutes into the film before I stopped to check how much time was left to the film.The DVD has quite a few nice extras, including the standard ""making of"" documentaries, an animated short, a look at teen thrillers, and a neat feature called ""Choose Their Fate,"" which allows the viewer to pick one of two options to see either a different way of a character getting offed or, in a couple of cases, the characters actually survive.Overall, I'd consider this a good rental, but I would only buy it if I already own the other two flicks and needed it for a complete set.",3,"More Of The Same, But It's Missing Something",1157155200,"09 2, 2006",2006,2372,"['really', 'enjoyed', 'first', 'two', 'Final', 'Destination', 'flicks', 'original', 'was', 'exactly', 'original', 'Having', 'Death', 'go', 'who', 'cheated', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'idea', 'second', 'film', 'bringing', 'back', 'Ali', 'Larter', 'minor', 'role', 'Tony', 'Todd', 'managed', 'keep', 'attention', 'very', 'well', 'kills', 'were', 'bit', 'more', 'extravagant', 'pacing', 'was', 'excellent.With', 'Final', 'Destination', '3', 'however', 'rollercoaster', 'lost', 'steam', 'Granted', 'kills', 'film', 'were', 'just', 'fun', 'intricately', 'built', 'other', 'two', 'films', 'lacked', 'characters', 'could', 'actually', 'pull', 'Wendy', 'played', 'Mary', 'Elizabeth', 'Winstead', 'closest', 'actual', 'hero', 'viewer', 'would', 'have', 'emotion', 'for.The', 'rest', 'characters', 'played', 'remotely', 'recognizable', 'Ryan', 'Merriman', 'Kris', 'Lemche', 'dude', 'who', 'actually', 'named', 'Texas', 'Battle', 'goth-girl', 'wannabe', 'Alexz', 'Johnson', 'x', 'end', 'name', 'cool', 'slew', 'other', 'unknowns', 'do', 'decent', 'job', 'standing', 'looking', 'brooding', 'hot', 'athletic', 'else', 'stereotyped', 'character', 'supposed', 'be.In', 'case', ""'re"", 'wondering', 'plot', 'same', 'other', 'two', 'flicks', 'Wendy', 'premonition', 'rollercoaster', 'ride', 'going', 'insanely', 'bad', 'actions', 'cause', 'few', 'other', 'people', 'miss', 'ride', 'Death', 'then', 'killing', 'off', 'order', 'would', 'have', 'died', 'coaster', 'rest', 'story', 'spent', 'showing', 'how', 'gory', 'intricate', 'deaths', 'can', 'become.Something', 'was', 'missing', 'here', 'Perhaps', 'just', 'fact', 'third', 'installment', 'series', 'become', 'boring', 'Maybe', 'was', 'lack', 'character', ""'d"", 'want', 'see', 'actually', 'survive', 'end', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'have', 'say', 'film', 'being', 'boring', 'moved', 'excellent', 'pace', 'was', 'forty-five', 'minutes', 'film', 'stopped', 'check', 'how', 'much', 'time', 'was', 'left', 'film.The', 'DVD', 'quite', 'few', 'nice', 'extras', 'including', 'standard', 'making', 'documentaries', 'animated', 'short', 'look', 'teen', 'thrillers', 'neat', 'feature', 'called', 'Choose', 'Their', 'Fate', 'viewer', 'pick', 'one', 'two', 'options', 'see', 'either', 'different', 'way', 'character', 'getting', 'couple', 'cases', 'characters', 'actually', 'survive.Overall', ""'d"", 'consider', 'good', 'rental', 'would', 'only', 'buy', 'already', 'own', 'other', 'two', 'flicks', 'needed', 'complete', 'set']",N/A

The last few seconds of the movie made an unexpecting ending but it was better than the ending the filmmaker's shot first.  (To see the alternate ending choose the choose their fate version and select Step right on Ian's death scene.  I recommend watching the actuall movie first though.)If you only watch a horror movie only for gory goodness or mainly for the gory goodness you are in luck.

Through other reviews I heard that a fourth FD movie is in the works but lets hope it doesn't suck.The choose their fate option of the movie I thought was a great addition in the DVD although it is just an alternative version in points but if you wish to control their fate it is a good option but like I said earlier watch the actuall movie first.To explain things in the horror genre and to explain such movies as Friday The 13th, Nightmare on elm street, Final Destination, The Texas Chainsaw Massacare etc. there is a featurette included on the second disc.

988001,A1CDZNPO7U4E6N,B000FC2HRW,LadyLestat,"[2, 4]","It never fails. If you somehow manage to get through the first and second film it's always at this point in most franchises where it usually goes down in flames. They manage to flush all the ideas that made the first 2 films so good right down the toilet. Personally, I'm stil confused as hell about the ending. The first 2 films had new and interesting concepts, but this whole rollercoaster thing was dumb. I wonder who do we have to thank for that horrible idea. Is that the best they could come up with? A rollercoaster? On top of that, the first 2 films found a way to tie in together, and in my opinion, that's very important. I hate it when they have sequels with no continuity, and sequels that have absolutely nothing to do with the 1st 2 movies. I think American filmakers need to follow a few tips from a moviegoer that has seen her fair share of movies.#1-To make a good plot...the story must first be INTERESTING!#2-You can't keep sticking to the same scare tactics. What creeped me out last time won't work the 2nd time around. It's just not as effective.#3-Don't ignore the previous films in the franchise. I don't care if it's part 3, 30, or 300. The viewers haven't forgotten what they've seen, and we can't be fooled. So, the movie needs to make sense.#4-If you're gonna branch off and tell another whole story let the movie stand on it's own. Don't call it the same as it's predecessors.#5-Quit using blood and gore as a replacement for originality, plot, and storyline.I think that if they would've reversed it and made the ending on the train the beginning, and went from there it might have been better. Another thing, it was a whole lot creepier when they had to figure out the signs that death was about to strike. The signs weren't explained in a photograph. I have said this before, and I'll say it again. Whether they are American or Canadian filmakers the premise still remains the same, and they need to understand that you can't just rely on showing a whole bunch of gory, nasty, and bloody scenes to the audience everytime you run out of ideas, and you know the movie blows. I notice they tend to do that quite often these days. They replace the plot and storyline for blood and violence. That's not entertainment, that's a distraction, and it's plan-B just in case plan-A doesn't work. Distract us from the fact that the movie is so bad and show us a lot of scenes to gross us out instead. They know that our society is based on so much violence that's enough to satisfy a lot of people. However, I'm not so easily impressed.

The opening of ""Final Destination 3"" is essentially the same as the original, only this time with a roller coaster instead of an airplane and with Wong letting it drag out a bit longer given this is familiar territory.  We know the rules of the game and until the initial death ride is over we cannot get to the main part of this 2006 horror film.  Wong and Morgna also know how to play the game and they make a conscious effort to up the ante for the death sequences.There are two key differences in ""Final Destination 3,"" of varying significance.  The first is that Wendy's camera has pictures of everybody who got off the roller coaster and she makes a connection between what is in the photograph of the first survivors to die and how they die.  Of course, sometimes there is more than one picture and figuring out what are the key elements in the movie comes at the last moment, but it does provide a different dynamic.  However, this is restricted to helping the audience pick up on the elements falling (usually literally) into place to set up the deaths.  Wendy discovers ominous photographs of both the World Trade Center attack and Lincoln's assassination that tie into her theory as well (Suddenly you flash on the next film, ""Final Destination 1865,"" but get confused as to how what happened at Ford's Theater could be turned into one of these Rube Goldbergesque circumstances).The second is that the corpses, if not the deaths, are way more gruesome (this movie wins the award for most gruesome death by a nail gun, which is not example a category short of nominations).  My wife was torn between using her hands to cover her face and grabbing my hand so she could dig her nails into my palms (she decided to go with closing her eyes and lowering her head so she could really dig those nails in nice and deep).  I think the best part of the ""Final Definition"" films are the way simple things conspire to kill someone and the first two in the first movie (Tod in the bathtub and Ms. Lewton in her kitchen) are still the best of the bunch.  But it has been a long time since I have seen a film where the deaths make you wince, partly because of the blood and everything but also because each one is set up to build the sense of anticipation of seeing something that you do not want to see.  If that is a key criteria for seeing a horror movie in a theater as opposed to waiting for it to come out on DVD, then ""Final Destination 3"" really delivers.  Let me just say that my wife has informed me in no uncertain terms that she will never go with me to a theater to see another horror film as long as she lives (and I suspect she will not go to see one without me either).The Achilles heel of the ""Final Destination"" films turns out to be the punch line at the end of the first film, which as I recall was not the original ending.  If you make only one film that final cut to black is a great in your face (or back of your head) ending.  But when you make a series it is problematic because it says that no matter what you see and no matter what they do, all of these kids are going to die.  You can stop short of the actual moment, but everybody is going to arrive at their final destination despite their best efforts.  Consequently, it makes sense that the ante has been upped on the deaths in this film because in the end what else does this story have to offer?",4,The first is still the best but this one is certainly the goriest,1139616000,"02 11, 2006",2006,5296,"['someone', 'walking', 'Turn', 'around', 'look', 'me.There', 'someone', 'watching', 'footsteps', 'Turn', 'around', 'look', 'meYes', 'old',

988011,A139ZF7CJVVTJU,B000FC2HRW,"Mark Eremite ""This Is A Display Model Only""","[0, 0]","At heart, all horror movies operate on the human response to mortality.  Your average horror fan gets a thrill from the films because they are a sort of spice for life, they are the seasoning that makes the mundane parts of life all the more richer.  Watch a bunch of people get sliced and diced by a monster or madman, and that adrenaline rush makes you feel as if, on some level, you yourself have cheated death.  For awhile or more, it's nice to be alive.The FINAL DESTINATION films utilize the same premise, but instead of creating a defeatable or relatable villain, it makes the very act of dying the villain.  Watching the movies, it's very much like they decided that the force of Death, after a millenia of ending lives, has grown bored and has decided to put some spice into his job.  In all of the movies, Death awards a young soul with a premonition of a huge catastrophe, and when that soul saves him/herself (along with a handful of others), Death gleefully sets up cat-and-mouse games with the survivors and watches as they scream and skitter.  The question is never Will They Die?  It is How Long Can They Hold Out?Because everyone dies, sooner or later, and it's rarely at the hands of a zombie or a Leatherface.  Car accidents are far more common.  Fires.  Mechanical failures.  The FD films make Death a snarky, sadistic force without ever showing his face.  Instead, Death operates basically through three cards -- wind, gravity, and passive human interference -- and with these three things, he orchestrates the deaths of dozens and dozens of characters.  These films are filled with pointless scenes of people screaming that they're in control of their lives, scoffing at the idea that Death lurks everywhere.  Then they die.The real fun in these films lies in the complex machinations that Death sets in motion with the leak of a pipe or the flutter of a bird.  If you're expecting interesting plots, complex characters, or realistic dialogue, prepare to be HEAVILY disappointed.  In fact, these elements of the films get steadily more and more wooden and cartoonish, until by the fourth installment, they are laughably bad.  The makers know that what you're really waiting for is to watch Death do his thing, investing everything from quarters to fishsticks with a sinister menace.  To that end, I have provided here a summary of the only thing about each of these films that is worth watching: the death scenes.Final Destination (New Line Platinum Series):In the first film, Death's premonition is visited upon a young student on a plane.  The ensuing plane accident (5/5) gave me nightmares for a week.  When the student leaves the plane along with others, he then experiences more premonitions (most of them cheesy reflections in windows) indicating that Death is now hunting them down.  Of all the movies, this one features the most personified version of Death.  A dark mist accompanies each death, and you can even see Death pursuing some characters, especially in a tense bathroom scene (4/5).  Some of the deaths feature complex sequences of domino-like chains (there is a catastrophic house fire (4/5) and a menacing electrical storm (4/5)).  Others are less creative (the bus and train accidents are both unimaginative throwaways (2/5)).  The final death (by sign) is a cheeky nod at the movie's premise (4/5).  Notable in this film: Death has a soundtrack, which turns out to feature, over and over again, ""Leaving on a Jet Plane.""Final Destination 2:Death isn't so hung up on music this time around, but that's okay because he's a bit more creative.  This film's opening highway accident is by far the best beginning out of any of these films (5/5), and when the storyline later ties the survivor's lives to the events of the first film, it's actually interestingly done.  Not as interesting as the deaths, though.  You've got a tongue-in-cheek apartment fire (4/5), a crushing visit to the dentist (4/5), and an unusually persistent elevator (3/5).  In one case, the jaws of life have the opposite function (4/5), and in another case a flying fence executes a mortal ballet (5/5).  There are also three explosive deaths that are a little cheap (2/5).  The characters this time around all get premonitions (again, mostly just false reflections in windows), and they spend a lot of pointless time trying to cheat Death's plan (their ideas mostly centering around a ""new life"").  The final scene, just as in the first film, is an over-the-top nyuck-nyuck moment.  ""It's all in fun,"" Death seems to be saying.Final Destination 3:This time around it's a roller coaster catastrophe (4/5).  The movie has a creative idea by putting the premonitions into poorly shot yearbook photos, and Death continues to get up in people's faces with ominous/ironic songs and smug little omens (before one death, characters at a drive-in watch as the word ""control"" disappears from the digital menu).  The first ""catch-up"" death in a tanning salon is perhaps the best of the film (5/5), although there's a nicely intricate set-up later in the film that involves a nail-gun (5/5).  A runaway truck and horse and a falling sign constitute some of the film's weaker executions (2/5, 3/5, and 2/5, respectively).  Elsewhere in the film, the movie's token ""I'm Gonna Live Forever!"" character battles death in a weight room (4/5).  The movie concludes with an intense subway scene that is kinda cool, but also sort of a rip off as far as endings go. (4/5)The Final Destination [Theatrical Release]:The opener here is the weakest of the franchise.  It takes place at a racing track, and so all of the subtle connections and coincidences get lost in the sprawling chaos of the catastrophe (3/5).  The premonitions this time around are ridiculously aggressive hallucinations, and they forecast some rather uncreative demises.  One man is murdered by a tow truck in a way that almost makes sense (1/5).  Another character bites it at a hair salon in a rather unsatisfying fashion (2/5).  There's a clever little two-fer where two characters simultaneously battle watery deaths, although both are almost too cartoonish to be all that scary (4/5 - car wash; 3/5 - swimming pool).  The movie's real saving grace (aside from the 3D, which does its job without much fuss) is it's final theater/mall debacle, which is witty, self-referential, and fairly intense (5/5).  The close of the movie (and, ostensibly, the franchise) is an unceremonious vehicular accident that is only notable for the X-ray vision it is finally shot in.",4,Death Gets All Up In Your

As in the first two Final Destination movies, she freaks out and gets her friends (and two other people who we dont find out who there were until the end) off the rollercoaster. At first they think they have cheated death, but then two of them (yes, thats right, two) die gruesomely in a tanning salon accident and they realised that death has come back for them and as stalking them one by one as they fall victim to seemingly random accidents...This movie is similar to the first two movies in the series, but unlike most sequels this is not in any way worse than the first or second movies. Final Destination 3 is gorier, scarier and more suspenceful than the previous movies which makes it an absolute must see. Plus, there are LOADS of extras on the disc including a ""You Choose Their Fate"" option of watching the movie where you make choices throughout the movie such as at what temporature Ashley and Ashlyn set the thermostat in the tanning salon. This is an excellent feature because it allows you to change the ways in which some of the charactors die.I would recomend this movie to fans of horror movies (particularly slasher/body count) especially if you like Final Destination and Final Destination 2.",5,Hope these sequels keep on coming,1237420800,"03 19, 2009",2009,1322,"['amusement', 'park', 'Wendy', 'vision', 'friends', 'dying', 'horrible', 'rollercoaster', 'accident', 'first', 'two', 'Final', 'Destination', 'movies', 'out', 'friends', 'two', 'other', 'people', 'who', 'dont', 'find', 'out', 'who', 'were', 'end', 'rollercoaster', 'first', 'think', 'have', 'cheated', 'death', 'then', 'two', 'yes', 'thats', 'right', 'two', 'die', 'gruesomely', 'tanning', 'salon', 'accident', 'realised', 'death', 'come', 'back', 'stalking', 'one', 'one', 'fall', 'victim', 'seemingly', 'random', 'accidents', 'movie', 'similar', 'first', 'two', 'movies', 'series', 'most', 'sequels', 'not', 'way', 'worse', 'first', 'second', 'movies', 'Final', 'Destination', '3', 'gorier', 'scarier', 'more', 'suspenceful', 'previous', 'movies', 'absolute', 'must', 'see', 'are', 'LOADS', 'extras', 'disc', 'including', 'Choose', 'Fate', 'option', 'watching', 'movie', 'where', 'make', 'choices', 'movie', 'such', 'what', 'temporature', 'Ashley', 'Ashlyn', 'set', 'thermostat', 'tanning', 'salon', 'excellent', 'feature', 'change', 'ways', 'charactors', 'die.I', 'would', 'recomend', 'movie', 'fans', 'horror', 'movies', 'particularly', 'slasher/body', 'count', 'especially', 'like', 'Final', 'Destination', 'Final', 'Destination', '2']",N/A
988013,AJUN4M9H1TUOK,B000FC2HRW,"Matt C. Handfield ""madcartoonist""","[2, 2]","Fans of Final Destination and Final Destination 2 may be a little disappointed with this Third installment.  As with the first two films teens get picked off one by one by Death or the presence of death  after  avoiding a disasterous accident.  In FD the accident avoided was a plane crash, in FD2 it was a multi car pile up on the highway.  This time around (through  a series of unfortunate events) a rollercoater derails sending its passengers through the air into the ground or pultruding poles, parts of the coaster scaffolding.  The Accident sequence in FD2 was more graphic and harder to look at(for those of you who are squeamish). Frankly the  Roller Coaster crash in CSI's season 4 episode ""A turn of screws"" was done better ( less gore, but almost more gruesome). After predicting the accident through clairvoyance Wendy(Winstead) gets off along with other teens who then get aced one at a time. Either way this film didn't have as much Gore as the fist two films. One of the plot devices used in this film was that the main character Wendy(Mary Elisabeth Winstead) uses the camera images of her friends to figure out who's next and how they die, almost as if these pictures are a portent or one might say an omen of how they die.....just like in that film 'The Omen'!  In FD2 all the victims in that movie were related(by circumstance) to the victims of FD. Not so much in this sequel the director goes back to a simpler unrelated young teen line up.  Although not as gory(I thought) as the first two, there are still plenty of chills and gasping moments worthy of tossing your popcorn, and a little unbridled flatulance!For an added treat you have the option to watch the theatrical release of this film, or a special version where at key parts through out the film you get to decide how things go down, more specifically  whether people meet their doom, or dodge the bullet......well some are like that. Pretty cool for a one time use. If you didn't see this film in the Theatre, watch the theatrical release and then watch it with the choose their fate option.In the special features(Disc 2) there is a making of Documentary. Also a feature called ""its all around you"" which is an animated short all about death, and the oddities of whether not stuff like what happened in the film could actually occur. Plus odds on dying in other ways...airplanes,  being shot by postal workers, etc.etc...One of the better useful parts of the special features disc is a short called ""dead teen movie"".  This twenty minuite short  is all about dead teen movies like Friday the 13th, Nightmare on Elm Street, Texas chainsaw Massacre and other horror/slasher films and why people go to see them, and why the industry makes them,  Interviewed in this feature are the makers of FD 3, Roger Ebert just to name a couple  As far as any extended scenes there is only one and its nothing special.

988014,A1VCPMT1RRS7K0,B000FC2HRW,Matt,"[2, 3]","Following very faithfully in the tradition of the first two movies in the series, Final Destination 3 is a cross between a cheesy teen movie and a gory horror film. The opening scene is effective in the suspense and sense of dread leading to the tragic event that kicks off this round of ""cheating death"". I don't particularly enjoy roller coasters myself, so this scene was rather disturbing, but it was done well.There are some nasty death scenes in this movie. I mean, it's nothing like a movie such as ""Hostel"", but the gratuitousness of the deaths almost don't seem to fit into what would otherwise remind you of a movie like ""Clueless"". They are creative, though. You are warned that something nasty is about to happen by the tone of the scene, yet you may still not be quite ready for it when it happens.The acting is better than I would have expected.

988015,A2R4XG0L7Z01V8,B000FC2HRW,"Meesha ""I'm A Lonely Angel Stuck On The Slow ...","[1, 3]","I'd just like to say on the record, I've loved both previous Final Destinations, and couldn't wait to get my hands on this one. I especially liked the fact that in you can take control of whether the characters die or don't die. Although I resisted when I first got it, and watched the theatrical version.I've now watched it twice, the theatrical version and today, the Choose Your Fate version. I didn't really change too much at first about the second version, although I ended up saving Frankie Cheeks (why?!) and if you choose the 76 degrees during the tanning salon scene, you actually see a slightly changed version of it - although both girls still die. Also, for previous reviewers who have had a little moan about the fact there's no links between this & the previous two, there is, but it's well hidden. Watch the Choose Your Fate version, and then right towards the end, in the train scene, the old guy who's sleeping on a bench, has newspapers covering him. You'll get the option to read an article on the newspaper, and there's your link to the previous movie. Very very cool.The actors in this are all amazing, especially Wendy (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), she has the amazing ability to cry at the drop of the hat, even when she wasn't really crying, just tearing up. Her and the actress who played her sister, could have been sisters in real life they looked so alike! Also, Kris Lemeche, who played Ian McKinley, was brilliant! I actually developed a tiny little crush on him during the film, but mainly because he reminded me so much of Christian Slater's character in Heathers. The look, the dry humour, the one liners - it was all Christian Slater! The rest of the actors were alright, dispensible really.The tanning salon scene really freaked me out! Having been to tanning salons many times before (albeit, in the upright booths) I knew about this in advance (I read the novelisation when I was on holiday), so I was prepared to see it, but it still really freaked me out. It's just so well filmed, almost realistic, and my skin literally felt like it was burning afterwards.The rollercoaster scenes were scary too. I've only been on two rollercoasters in my life, and I don't plan going on any again. The first one I kept my eyes closed the entire time, the second time was a tiny one on holiday.I LOVED the new element to the Final Destination franchise, clues being left to how each character is going to die. Very well thought out, and lots of different and original deaths. All the clues are stored in photos taken, and there's little clues left in all of them to how that individual character is going to die. It makes for great fun for the viewers to work out what's going to happen.The final was changed after test screenings from audiences proved negative, but I have to say I liked the original ending, and the alternate. The alternate brings a new spin onto things, and definitely makes you jump.The extras on this are amazing, and very informative, although there are a couple that are actually LONGER than the film itself. There's some great scenes of how they filmed the rollercoaster scene (which is a shame, as you can spot what they've done in the film afterwards), and in one night, the actors had to ride the rollercoaster 26 times, so they could get all the shots in - and some hilarity as everyone takes bets on who's gonna throw up first.Listen out for Tony Todd as the voice of the devil (how appropriate), and also the train announcer at the end of the movie.This is definitely my favourite out of all 3 of the Final Destination films, and will definitely be watching it again, just so I can try all the different outcomes of the Choose Your Fate feature.",4,"""Watch the boxes!""

So, here goes the story, a girl named Wendy, played by Mary Elizabeth Winstead (The Ring Two, Sky High) has a premonition about the roller coaster that she is about to ride which goes crazy and everyone dies. Her and some other people get off the roller coaster and it suddenly happens. Kevin, played by Ryan Merriman (The Ring Two, Halloween: Resurrection) tells Wendy about a kid who 6 years ago foresaw a plane blowing up and everyone started to die afterwards. Wendy doesnt believe him until she actually sees it. So, Wendy and Kevin go around trying to warn everyone who was on the roller coaster and eventually they all die one by one. Horrible to put it to you clear, will serve up something for the people who love to see teenagers kick the bucket in different ways.

The scene in the workout room where we know something horrible is going to happen is one of the best in the movie, and the other strange twists of fate are equally effective.

Good call, especially after you see how cheesily FD2 is wrapped up and the plot of FD3 is unfurled.

His real audio demo tapes for the casting of the first one were used over a loudspeaker. Kudos.Now for the bad, which far outweighs the good.

The acting isn't horrible (nor are the actors) and steers clear of complete hysterical panicking.I was a little apprehensive going into this 3rd installment of Final Destination, seeing as how I loved the first two, and I thought the third was going to completely butcher the whole basis of the movie.This third movie doesn't focus too much on the whole ""Death psychology"" like in the first two (especially with Final Destination 2 and the whole Death Ripple Effect), which is why it didn't appeal to me quite as much, the teens aren't trying to figure out quite as hard how to escape Death's scheme, they're more trying to figure out how to stay alive by avoiding danger.  Then again, it's not made to be a psychological thriller, it's just made to enjoy, and it works perfectly.Other than that, I have no complaints.  It's very entertaining, and while some deaths left me laughing at how preposterous they were, some of them left me feeling extremely queasy...Let's just say I won't be getting into a tanning bed anytime soon...But on a whole it's not too gore, which makes it completely tolerable.Even though it's not as good as the first two Final Destination movies, it's a movie I'd definitely recommend.  Even if you're uneasy around bloodshed, it's not a movie like ""Hostel"", and you'll still be able to enjoy it.  It's highly entertaining and in some ways comedic, which is what it's made for and completely succeeds in doing.",4,"Not as good as the first two, but you're still in for a good time!",1146787200,"05 5, 2006",2006,1611,"['plane', 'explosion', 'highway', 'pile-up', 'time', 'roller', 'coaster', 'death', 'ride.The', 'movie', ""n't"", 'bad', 'quite', 'share', 'gruesome', 'yet', 'entertaining', 'deaths', 'acting', ""n't"", 'horrible', 'are', 'actors', 'steers', 'clear', 'complete', 'hysterical', 'panicking.I', 'was', 'little', 'apprehensive', 'going', '3rd', 'installment', 'Final', 'Destination', 'seeing', 'how', 'loved', 'first', 'two', 'thought', 'third', 'was', 'going', 'completely', 'butcher', 'whole', 'basis', 'movie.This', 'third', 'movie', ""n't"", 'focus', 'too', 'much', 'whole', 'Death', 'psychology', 'first', 'two', 'especially', 'Final', 'Destination', '2', 'whole', 'Death', 'Ripple', 'Effect', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'appeal', 'quite', 'as', 'much', 'teens', 'are', ""n't"", 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'quite', 'as', 'hard', 'how', 'escape', 'Death', 'scheme', ""'re"", 'more', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'stay', 'alive', 'avoiding', 'danger', 'Then', 'again', 'not', 'made', 'be', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'just', 'made', 'enjoy', 'perfectly.Other', 'have', 'complaints', 'very', 'entertaining', 'deaths', 'left', 'laughing', 'how', 'preposterous', 'were', 'left', 'feeling', 'extremely', 'queasy', 'Let', 'just', 'say', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'getting', 'tanning', 'bed', 'anytime', 'soon', 'whole', 'not', 'too', 'gore', 'completely', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'first', 'two', 'Final', 'Destination', 'movies', 'movie', ""'d"", 'definitely', 'recommend', 'Even', ""'re"", 'uneasy', 'bloodshed', 'not', 'movie', 'Hostel', ""'ll"", 'still', 'be', 'able', 'enjoy', 'highly', 'entertaining', 'ways', 'comedic', 'what', 'made', 'completely', 'doing']",N/A

988023,A2CZGWJNKCKJDY,B000FC2HRW,MovieLover,"[4, 5]","***THIS REVIEW WILL CONTAIN SOME MAJOR SPOILERS, DO NOT READ IF YOU DO NOT WISH TO BE SPOILED***Being a big fan of the Final Destination movies, I was overly excited to hear that a Final Destination 3 would soon be gracing the theater screens, I wondered what accident they could come up with and put into effect in this one, after hearing that it would be a Rollercoaster disaster that started the film off, I was drooling all over the place, I wasn't sure if they could top the insane highway pile up accident seen in the second FD film.I had my expectations set high for this film and first i'll say, it met them perfectly, yeah there were some nitpicks I found in the film but overall, the great outdid the bad.The film basically starts off with a control freak senior, Wendy Christenson (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), enjoying herself at an amusement park celebrating her and her friends upcoming High School graduation. Everythings all fun and games, that is until her and her friends board a Rollercoaster, it crashes, people are thrown from there carts, carts tear off and leap from the tracks, people are impaled, people hang onto there harnesses for dear life when the Coaster goes upside down, great, action packed stuff. Everyone dies in the accident, but wait, it was only a vision seen by our main protagonist, Wendy of course, she freaks and gets herself as well as 9 other kids kicked off the ride, soon after, she witnesses the ride crashing, just like in her premonition, everyone on board dieing, including her best friend and boyfriend who tried to get off but were not allowed by security. Wendy feels guilty about not trying harder to stop the ride and has basically shunned herself from everyone around her, when Kevin, her best friends boyfriend, comes to her with a theory that death might be coming back to reclaim its victims, she basically tells him to F off and thinks hes being his usual, jackass self, but when two of the people who got off the ride die in violent, vicious ways, she begins to believe and realizes that Kevin was right, and that clues of there soon-to-happen deaths are hidden in photographs that she had tooken of the survivors for the High School Yearbook at the amusement park. Her and Kevin team up to try and prevent death from claiming them and the other survivors.The Accident: I'll admit, the accident wasn't as great as I was hoping for, it just didn't give that all out crazy, in your face feeling that the accident in the second movie had, but all that said, the accident was still visually amazing and directed with some quick sly and action paced movements, I had my hand gripping the armrest next to me in the theater, you could sense the fear that the charectors had while it was happening, especially when the harnesses first give way and flew up, the fear in the charectors expressions and actions were so convincing, especially from Wendy. The CGI was surprisingly not as bad as I expected it to be, it was only noticeable in a couple segments of the scene, including one where a guy is barely hanging onto his harness as the Coaster spins around on a loop, sending him in a messy circle of hanging on for his life, and even the CGI wasn't that bad during that scene. The climax of that scene was also great and effective, seeing Wendy screaming as she hurtled down to the track below and then coming out of her vision just before she meets with the track face on.The Acting and Charector Development: This is where the film was weak, the acting was sort of stale at many times, fortunetly, it was from the actors whose charectors bite the dust early on in the film, there were three actors that I just could not stand to watch anymore and was just hoping that death would kill them off all at once, even if it did disobey the order of the design. Fortunetly we don't have to deal with them that long. I will give big props to Mary Elizabeth Winstead (Sky High, the upcoming Bobby) who was excellent as the lead, I didn't find any faults with her, Ryan Merriman (The upcoming Home Of The Giants) was also very convincing. Though not as great as those two, Alexz Johnson (TV's Instant Star) and Kris Lemche (Ginger Snaps) were great in there roles of Erin and Ian, the gothic/punk rokish emo couple, last but not least, Amanda Crew (TV's Life As We Know It) was fine in the part of Wendys younger sister, Julie. Jesse Moss (Ginger Snaps) and Gina Holden were also great as Jason Wise and Carrie Dreyer, the boyfriend and best friend of Wendy, even if they were only in it from the beginning up until after the Rollercoaster accident. The rest of the cast were pretty bad in my honest opinion, though Texas Battle (Coach Carter) wasn't nearly as bad as Crystal Lowe, Chelan Simmons and Sam Easton.Now onto the Charector Development, well, basically there wasn't really any, that was my main problem with the film, it seemed like the creators thought that the film would be better if it focused on just the two main charectors and the gory, bloody deaths, well while that works, it would have been nice to care about the charectors at least a little, but the only charectors I found myself even remotely caring for were Wendy (Winstead), Kevin (Merriman), Julie (Crew) and perhaps Erin (Johnson), all the others I felt were just there to get picked off and nothing more, as a matter of fact, all the actors besides Winstead, Merriman, Crew and Lemche were only featured in the film for about ten minutes as a whole and were then picked off in there scenes rather quickly. I would have liked to have seen more of Alexz Johnsons charector, Erin Ulmer, and was sad to see her featured in the movie for less than twenty minutes all together, though Johnson had the advantage of having one of the best scenes in the movie being her last. So heres to hoping that there is more added charector development in the possible fourth movie, which I expect considering the high box office numbers this movie got.The Deaths: My god, this movie was put out to shock us with insane, grusome gory deaths, and let me tell you it did its job. There was only one death in this movie that didn't have me covering my mouth and whispering or shouting ""Damn!"" too, only one, the other ones were just so crazy, this movie was def. the bloodiest of the three, i'll never go to a Tanning Salon for any reason after seeing this movie, and i'll def. be a lot more weary of my surroundings while walking into a Warehouse/Home Depot type store, or when taking a future trip to the Gym. The best death had to be the Nail Gun death at the Home Improvement Store, bloody goodness and man did the charector suffer! All in all, I went into the movie expecting some insane, gory deaths and I got what I wanted. This movie also had the highest body count i'd say.The Climax to the film: I must say, I didn't know how they'd end this film and I was happy with the result I got, it just let you know that sometimes you can't escape death and you have to basically deal with it. I liked the fact that the ending provided a second disaster, a Subway accident, really nifty and it was a real big bonus.When the DVD comes out, i'll be going out of my way to pick a copy up, can't

X-Files alumni James Wong and Glen Morgan return to the series they helped spawn with Final Destination 3; which is sadly the worst installment of the series yet.  Rising star Mary Elizabeth Winstead (soon to be seen in Grind House and Live Free or Die Hard) has a premonition of impending doom on a rollercoaster ride, and wouldn't you know it as soon as she and a few friends exit that everybody dies painful and horrible deaths?  Anyone familiar with the first two films knows what's going to happen, the sad part is that this time around isn't as fun as the other two.  The first film was a surprisingly good thriller, while the lesser second installment was trashy fun.  Final Destination 3 just doesn't have that spark that made the other films guilty pleasures.  Not to mention that most of the actors are terrible to boot, but Winstead is plenty easy on the eyes.  There's some nice CGI generated gore effects, and some inventive deaths (you'll want to avoid tanning beds for a while); although many of which can't hold a candle to anything found in the first two films.  Final Destination 3 isn't absolutely horrible, but it's not the enjoyable, sleezy trash fest that one would come to expect from the series either.

Dying in a tanning machine, I mean come on! BTW, how can the supply voltage increase beyond 240VAC, unless it affects the entire electric grid? And getting your head crushed by a ""nowhere to be found"" workout equipment is just cheap. I mean this equipment was tailored to crush heads. And I wasn't really into the home improvement store scenes because believe it or not, we don't have one here, at least not like that fancy one.

988030,A3C2HQOFO37TFN,B000FC2HRW,Pamela Walters,"[1, 4]","I seen this movie in the theater, and I have to say it was a big disappointment. I am a big fan of the first 2 Final Destination movies for 2 reasons. 1 being that there's never really been a movie like this before, and 2 the sequel really took what was in the first movie and kept its original integrity, as well as added something new to it. I like when movies do that. I look forward to sequels only if they start treading new ground, and come up with clever ways to make the story keep going.This movie has none of those qualities. This is a movie sequel just for the sake of doing a sequel. Which in New Line's minds (I happen to love New Line) is a big dollar sign. I think if they would have taken their time with this movie and developed the right script and not rushed it out until it was something special, this would have been about 50 times better than the movie you see on this dvd. I look back on movies New Line has made in the past like Nightmare On Elm Street, and I think they did a good job. But this movie isn't worth the disc it's printed on. They're ruining the franchise with this garbage, much like they did with SAW. Saw is another good example of an amazing first film, and how they ruined it with sequels. This movie has turned into a complete gorefest, which I can't stand. I like horror movies, but not for Gore. I like em for just sheer terror, and darkness.Take a movie like Halloween for instance. There's no blood or gore, the movie is about the unconscious mind, and about the setting. That is what makes the movie creepy, not how many people get killed, or how brutal they get killed. To me what made Final Destination creepy was the fact that you knew Death was coming, but didn't know how or when it was going to take someone, so you were on the edge of your seat. This movie you pretty much know when everyone is gonna die, and even have a good idea when.I think they took a step back with this one because #1 was completely original, and then #2 was the next step, and started treading new ground. Then they stopped that momentum dead by doing a movie with no story to it whatsoever, and just made it about senseless killing. There was no mystery, no storyline to it, no motivation to any of it. You didn't know why these people are dying, so there's nothing really to resolve at the end of the movie because there's no conflict in the movie whatsoever other than death itself. At least in the other 2 they shed some insight into why these people die. That life and death has a master plan, and if you cheat death it will move onto someone else, or come back at you twice as hard.I hear they're making #4, and honestly I've had enough. I can't stand to see them ruin another good franchise with another crappy sequel. I stopped watching SAW after #2, and I think I will stop watching this one after #3. So I wouldn't recommend this to anyone because I'm disappointed in New Line for ruining the great momentum they had with #1 and #2 with this sad disappointment of a movie.I do however recommend #1 and #2 in the Final Destination cd because they are masterpieces in the thriller/horror genre.",1,Not worth the money...,1222473600,"09 27, 2008",2008,3133,"['seen', 'movie', 'theater', 'have', 'say', 'was', 'big', 'disappointment', 'am', 'big', 'fan', 'first', '2', 'Final', 'Destination', 'movies', '2', 'reasons', '1', 'being', 'never', 'really', 'been', 'movie', 'before', '2', 'sequel', 'really', 'took', 'what', 'was', 'first', 'movie', 'kept', 'original', 'integrity', 'as', 'well', 'added', 'something', 'new', 'like', 'when', 'movies', 'do', 'look', 'forward', 'sequels', 'only', 'start', 'treading', 'new', 'ground', 'come', 'up', 'clever', 'ways', 'make', 'story', 'keep', 'going.This', 'movie', 'none', 'qualities', 'movie', 'sequel', 'just', 'sake', 'doing', 'sequel', 'Which', 'New', 'Line', 'minds', 'happen', 'love', 'New', 'Line', 'big', 'dollar', 'sign', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'taken', 'time', 'movie', 'developed', 'right', 'script', 'not', 'rushed', 'out', 'was', 'something', 'special', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'about', '50', 'times', 'better', 'movie', 'see', 'dvd', 'look', 'back', 'movies', 'New', 'Line', 'made', 'past', 'Nightmare', 'Elm', 'Street', 'think', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'movie', ""n't"", 'worth', 'disc', 'printed', ""'re"", 'ruining', 'franchise', 'garbage', 'much', 'did', 'SAW', 'Saw', 'good', 'example', 'amazing', 'first', 'film', 'how', 'ruined', 'sequels', 'movie', 'turned', 'complete', 'gorefest', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'like', 'horror', 'movies', 'not', 'Gore', 'like', 'just', 'sheer', 'terror', 'darkness.Take', 'movie', 'Halloween', 'instance', 'blood', 'gore', 'movie', 'unconscious', 'mind', 'setting', 'movie', 'creepy', 'not', 'how', 'many', 'people', 'get', 'killed', 'how', 'brutal', 'get', 'killed', 'what', 'made', 'Final', 'Destination', 'creepy', 'was', 'fact', 'knew', 'Death', 'was', 'coming', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'when', 'was', 'going', 'take', 'someone', 'were', 'edge', 'seat', 'movie', 'pretty', 'much', 'know', 'when', 'everyone', 'gon', 'die', 'even', 'have', 'good', 'idea', 'when.I', 'think', 'took', 'step', 'back', 'one', 'because', '1', 'was', 'completely', 'original', 'then', '2', 'was', 'next', 'step', 'started', 'treading', 'new', 'ground', 'Then', 'stopped', 'momentum', 'dead', 'doing', 'movie', 'story', 'whatsoever', 'just', 'made', 'senseless', 'killing', 'was', 'mystery', 'storyline', 'motivation', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'people', 'are', 'dying', 'nothing', 'really', 'resolve', 'end', 'movie', 'conflict', 'movie', 'other', 'death', 'least', 'other', '2', 'shed', 'insight', 'why', 'people', 'die', 'life', 'death', 'master', 'plan', 'cheat', 'death', 'will', 'move', 'someone', 'else', 'come', 'back', 'twice', 'hard.I', 'hear', ""'re"", 'making', '4', 'honestly', ""'ve"", 'had', 'enough', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'see', 'ruin', 'good', 'franchise', 'crappy', 'sequel', 'stopped', 'watching', 'SAW', '2', 'think', 'will', 'stop', 'watching', 'one', '3', 'would', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'anyone', ""'m"", 'disappointed', 'New', 'Line', 'ruining', 'great', 'momentum', 'had', '1', '2', 'sad', 'disappointment', 'movie.I', 'do', 'however', 'recommend', '1', '2', 'Final', 'Destination', 'cd', 'are', 'masterpieces', 'thriller/horror', 'genre']",N/A

A group of teens (I never understood why they couldn't use adults... it's always a group of college friends) discover that death itself was not finished with them and it will continue to mutilate them and the one who knows most about it (Mary Elizabeth Winsted ""The Thing Prequel (2011)"") is the one who must find away around the obstacles and cheat deaths design!Review: The guy who directed the original Final Destination directed this one and he produced Black Christmas the same year! But come on... this is ridiculous. The plot/story isn't adding anything new or likable to the series besides the opening disaster, the deaths, and different actors stuck in different situations! I wish that they could've done something better with the series by now!

but I was left feeling empty by the time the end credits rolled while watching this third instalment.The story and characters just didn't grab me enough.I really didn't care too much about the cookie cutter characters or the tired plot.They all failed to interest me except for  the lead actress(Mary Elizabeth Winstead) and perhaps Alexz Johnson (female lead of the Canadian Tv show Instant Star), who plays the goth chick.Sure,it had the nudity(tanning booth scene),gore and suspense that most of these teen Throrror (combo thriller and horror flick) films have;though,with more of an emphasis on the gory deaths rather than anything else.I still enjoyed the movie while I was watching it (with all the lights off and my surround on),but after it was all over, I was left feeling empty and just smiled when it ended and thought:O.K.,so that's it?All righty then.DVD EXTRAS:Luckily,the DVD extras add much more to this movie and make it feel like it was less of a time waster than it actually was.The other reviewers cover them well enough except for mentioning that there is a minor extended police station scene (that shouldn't have been edited)included in these DVD extras and also an almost 90 minute 'Making Of' featurette that is very well done.It was perhaps one of the more interesting and well done ones I have ever seen.I've seen more involved and detailed 'Making Of' or behind the scenes featurettes, but I often end up fast-forwarding through most of the stuff.In this one,though,only a few minutes here and there bored me.Some of what's mentioned in the so-so director,etc.(NO cast)movie commentary is also mentioned in it as well.There are even more features about the making of this movie but those were more typical and less interesting than the main 90 minute one.FINAL THOUGHTS:As this is the first movie review I have ever posted,it's further proof that I still have this movie fresh in my mind even though I watched it yesterday and found it to be rather common.I'm surprised how much that 90 minute 'Making Of' featurette added to my enjoyment of this movie.After watching it, I went back to watch a few scenes of  Final Destination 3 over again and realized how natural a screamer Mary Elizabeth Winstead is.Is there an academy award for screaming?I can't really recommend the movie on it's own,unless you're in the mood for a fairly

She becomes so upset that seven of the seniors leave the ride, and of course, the premonition of disaster comes true.  Her boyfriend dies in the crash, but Kevin (Ryan Merriman) his best friend lives.  Kevin has done his research, and finds an ""urban legend"" about a similar occurrence on Flight 180 years ago (a tricky reference to Final Destination #1), warning Wendy that the seven survivors are in danger.At first Wendy disbelieves Kevin, but as after two survivors die in a tanning bed mishap (I loved this scene, especially the fact that they were listening to ""Roller Coaster Of Love"" while they died), Wendy looks again at the photos taken the night of the crash and decides that the rest of the kids need to be warned.The 'Final Destination' movies are simple, flash-in-the-pan horror flicks with a bunch of teenagers and a bunch of grisly deaths.  This third installment holds true to the format and won't disappoint fans of the first two movies.  Head ""poppers"" seem to be a favorite of the death scenes.  A special mention goes to actor Kris Lemche as Ian McKinley, my favorite character.One thing Part Three has that the other two didn't is a special interactive feature on the DVD called ""Choose Their Fate"", which is fun.  I recommend watching the theatrical version first, then have some fun with the ""Choices"".  The choices don't have much to do with the outcome, but lead to different scenes, and besides, its fun to interact.  Some lengthen and some shorten the theatrical version.  You can also back up the scene and pick differently if you choose.'Final Destination 3' is a solid addition to the first two movies, if you like teenage horror flicks.  Definitely worth a purchase.

I liked the second movie so much I was really hoping they could top it. Don't get me wrong, FD3 is a very good movie! I will buying it when it comes out to DVD, and I definitely would recommend going to theaters and seeing it. So, with that being said, I want to start off saying I do not think this one topped the first two movies. It does how ever offer a few deaths scenes that make it a must watch for gore lovers. I will not try to give too much away, but I will try to sum it up as best as possible: The acting isn't up to par with the first too movies. I didn't feel as attached to these characters as I did in the first too movies. It had kind of a cheesy feeling to it. Maybe like a ""Scary movie"" or ""scream"" kind of atmosphere. It was a movie that couldn't possibly scare anyone, and never seemed to take itself seriously. I think these kids were no where near as good as the kids in the other movies.Next, the plot is over done. Even though I love this series and wish it would go on forever, I can easily see how the concept is getting very burnt out. The plot was overdone and lacked any surprises for those of us who have seen the first 2. I also agree with the one review who said the death scenes didn't seem as elaborate in this one. There was a lot of ""splatter death"" in this one: an easy horror movie effect. A horror movie example: throw a body in front of a moving vehicle, then show the blood hitting onlookers in the face. Yea, its bloody, so what? Remember in FD2, the scene with the barbed wire fence? I think it took a lot more creativity to make that scene than it does to make blood splattering against people's faces. Once again, don't get me wrong here. This movie does have it moments, and it does have about 2 scenes that might be the goriest in the trilogy, but it still did not outdo the other ones. So your left with an all to familiar plot, not so hot acting and some beautiful gore FX. In the end though, what really brought this movie down for me was the ending. Anyone could have wrote a better ending. Since this is supposed to be the last movie in the series I was really hoping for something explosive, unexpected, and extraordinary for an ending, instead it was very cheesy.Verdict: they don't make too many movies this gory anymore, for that reason alone it is worth seeing, just don't expect a lot of new territory here.",4,"Good, but I think #2 was probably the best out of the series",1139702400,"02 12, 2006",2006,2474,"['really', 'REALLY', 'wanted', 'give', '5', 'stars', 'guess', 'had', 'expectations', 'too', 'high', 'when', 'went', 'see', 'liked', 'second', 'movie', 'so', 'much', 'was', 'really', 'hoping', 'could', 'top', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'FD3', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'will', 'buying', 'when', 'out', 'DVD', 'definitely', 'would', 'recommend', 'going', 'theaters', 'seeing', 'So', 'being', 'said', 'want', 'start', 'off', 'saying', 'do', 'not', 'think', 'one', 'topped', 'first', 'two', 'movies', 'how', 'ever', 'offer', 'few', 'deaths', 'scenes', 'make', 'must', 'watch', 'gore', 'lovers', 'will', 'not', 'try', 'give', 'too', 'much', 'away', 'will', 'try', 'sum', 'up', 'as', 'best', 'possible', 'acting', ""n't"", 'up', 'par', 'first', 'too', 'movies', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'as', 'attached', 'characters', 'did', 'first', 'too', 'movies', 'had', 'kind', 'cheesy', 'feeling', 'Maybe', 'Scary', 'movie', 'scream', 'kind', 'atmosphere', 'was', 'movie', 'could', ""n't"", 'possibly', 'scare', 'anyone', 'never', 'seemed', 'take', 'seriously', 'think', 'kids', 'were', 'where', 'near', 'as', 'good', 'kids', 'other', 'movies.Next', 'plot', 'done', 'Even', 'love', 'series', 'wish', 'would', 'go', 'forever', 'can', 'easily', 'see', 'how', 'concept', 'getting', 'very', 'burnt', 'out', 'plot', 'was', 'overdone', 'lacked', 'surprises', 'who', 'have', 'seen', 'first', '2', 'also', 'agree', 'one', 'review', 'who', 'said', 'death', 'scenes', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'elaborate', 'one', 'was', 'lot', 'splatter', 'death', 'one', 'easy', 'horror', 'movie', 'effect', 'horror', 'movie', 'example', 'throw', 'body', 'front', 'moving', 'vehicle', 'then', 'show', 'blood', 'hitting', 'onlookers', 'face', 'Yea', 'bloody', 'what', 'Remember', 'FD2', 'scene', 'barbed', 'wire', 'fence', 'think', 'took', 'lot', 'more', 'creativity', 'make', 'scene', 'make', 'blood', 'splattering', 'people', 'Once', 'again', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'here', 'movie', 'have', 'moments', 'have', '2', 'scenes', 'might', 'be', 'goriest', 'trilogy', 'still', 'did', 'not', 'outdo', 'other', 'ones', 'So', 'left', 'familiar', 'plot', 'not', 'so', 'hot', 'acting', 'beautiful', 'gore', 'FX', 'end', 'what', 'really', 'brought', 'movie', 'down', 'was', 'ending', 'Anyone', 'could', 'have', 'wrote', 'better', 'ending', 'supposed', 'be', 'last', 'movie', 'series', 'was', 'really', 'hoping', 'something', 'explosive', 'unexpected', 'extraordinary', 'ending', 'instead', 'was', 'very', 'cheesy.Verdict', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'too', 'many', 'movies', 'gory', 'anymore', 'reason', 'alone', 'worth', 'seeing', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'lot', 'new', 'territory', 'here']",N/A
988044,AVI158V7UOB2B,B000FC2HRW,Sir Cinephiliac,"[0, 0]","It seems mildly ironic and amusing that a film called Final Destination could have so many sequels, however I'm definitely not ashamed to be one of the loyal fans that keeps coming back for more.Albeit not an altogether fresh concept, and disregarding one or two plot holes (the omission of the falling video camera in the real accident that proceeded the first vision, should have caused a slightly different sequence of events I think... my two cents anyway), FD3 contained the essential ingredient for any good horror flick, it played on the very real, yet oftentimes repressed fear that many of us face.For me, the whole FD concept was so thrilling because it effectively played on my fear of having no control. Certainly, many people experience this to some degree. For me, it's things like plane flights, medical operations, and other similar situations that I dread. And these situations where control is virtually out of my hands, I do my best to avoid. The latest FD thriller has definitely helped to reinforce that compulsion. It has also given me a new reason not to enjoy any rollercoaster rides any time soon!Since I am a fellow control freak, I could immediately sympathize with Wendy, the lead character, played quite compellingly by the beautiful Mary Elizabeth Winstead, who had no desire to join her classmates for a thrill ride that would have kept her captive and with no control over her life for three intense minutes.Fortunately, Wendy made the right decision to abort the ride in the nick of time. Unfortunately, the tireless force of death, played by a cold, shadowy, foreboding gust of wind, was not amused... or perhaps it was, because it continued to knock off her fellow schoolmates one by one in some of the most gruesome, and innovative ways imaginable; Speaking of which, for those tanning bed enthusiasts out there, please be warned: this movie may compel you to switch back to good old-fashioned sunbathing.Although watching this movie definitely did not help me overcome my fear-- on the contrary, I doubt that I will visit a theme park any time soon-- I sincerely thank the creative minds that made this psychological thrill ride possible.

Final Destination 2 was also pretty good....It was a good sequel but a lot of the suspense that the first one had was gone because you pretty much were familiar enough with the concept to know that Death was coming fast and ugly for those that cheated It.Final Destination 3 had almost 0 suspense. You knew what would happen to everyone that cheated Death in the initial scene...it was just a matter of what kind of grotesque accident would befall the cheaters.Death and gore lovers will have a field day with Final Destination 3. There's all kinds of death and mutilation. The initial, well-publicized roller coaster scene is worth the price of admission. But the movie follows the roller coaster scene with a very predictable pattern of building up to the next gruesome death with some torturous B acting. It was easier to watch the deaths than the acting in between the deaths.The Final Destination formula is worn out and old.

O'Blenis,"[2, 3]","Final Destination 3 heads away from the first two movies in the series (which were linked by having some common characters) and brings in a brand new batch of players who escape death due to an uncanny premonition by one of their group, this time a high school student named Wendy (played by Mary Elizabeth Winstead, one of my personal favorites), only to have death seemingly come after them, as the survivors again begin dying in a series of bizarre freak accidents.  The connection to the previous movies is basically established by some internet research undetaken by Wendy after the deaths begin, which uncovers a history of similar phenomenon - groups of people who avoid death thanks to a premonition, only to all die shortly afterwards, usually under weird circumstances.This time the 'cause of death' which claims a number of lives isn't a plane crash or a multi-car pile-up on the highway, but an accident on an amusement park roller coaster ride.  The Final Destination series has become famous for some really spectacular sequences involving the various accidents and/or death's attempts to reclaim its victims, and the roller coaster scenario certainly sets the stage for a continuation of this theme.  As a note of interest, an additional possible link to previous films comes in the form of the 'voice of the devil' at the entrance to one of the amusement park rides: the voice is that of Tony Todd, who also played the undertaker Mr. Bludworth in the first two Final Destination films, the eerie guy who seems to know too much about this whole phenomenon.  Whether this was just a neat bit of casting or whether there's an actual connection to the voice and the Bludworth character is in the same class as all the questions about Bludworth that were in the subtext of the previous movies.  It's there waiting to be explored further, should they choose to do so in a future movie.In the first Final Destination, the group who survived were members of a high school class who all knew each other but didn't necesarily get along, and they grew closer as they faced the death phenomenon.  In Final Destination 2 it was mostly strangers, mostly likable characters, who quickly knit into a cohesive group.  In this chapter the survivors mostly know each other peripherally, but in contrast to the first two movies, the group grows increasingly at odds and in some cases hostile as events escalate.  After noticing that the deaths happen in the same order that they would have if the premonition hadn't changed things, one character even comes up with the idea that maybe most of the deaths - including his own - could be avoided if they just knocked off the last person on the list first.  So the pursuit of the death phenomenon itself isn't necessarily the only threat this time around.  The acting, as usual in the series is well done; Amanda Crew fromThe Haunting in Connecticut (Unrated Special Edition), another of my personal favorites, is also in it as Wendy's younger (by a year) sister Julie.  The special effects are fantastic.The DVD version of Final Destination 3 makes use of a unique 'Choose Your Fate' option, where the viewer will periodically make decisions for the characters using the remote, some of which actually change the movie.  Very cool feature that I'm surprised hasn't been used a bit more often; it would lose its appeal if used too often, but if used for the right movie every now and then, I think it would be good.  It certainly seems more appealing to me than all the next-generation special features for Blu-Ray, like watching the movie and watching the 'making of' at the same time in separate boxes.The third chapter of the Final Destination series doesn't re-invent the wheel of the series, it just uses that existing wheel to extremely good effect and gives it some extra twists and turns.  One of the best installments in a great series, and the 'Choose Your Fate' option is an extra bonus, especially for repeat viewing.",5,"Great Chapter In The Series, With A Cool 'Choose Your Fate' Bonus Option",1265846400,"02 11, 2010",2010,3971,"['Final', 'Destination', '3', 'heads', 'away', 'first', 'two', 'movies', 'series', 'were', 'linked', 'having', 'common', 'characters', 'brand', 'new', 'batch', 'players', 'who', 'escape', 'death', 'due', 'uncanny', 'premonition', 'one', 'group', 'time', 'high', 'school', 'student', 'named', 'Wendy', 'played', 'Mary', 'Elizabeth', 'Winstead', 'one', 'personal', 'favorites', 'only', 'have', 'death', 'seemingly', 'come', 'survivors', 'again', 'begin', 'dying', 'series', 'bizarre', 'freak', 'accidents', 'connection', 'previous', 'movies', 'basically', 'established', 'internet', 'research', 'undetaken', 'Wendy', 'deaths', 'begin', 'history', 'similar', 'phenomenon', 'groups', 'people', 'who', 'avoid', 'death', 'thanks', 'premonition', 'only', 'die', 'shortly', 'afterwards', 'usually', 'weird', 'circumstances.This', 'time', ""'cause"", 'death', 'number', 'lives', ""n't"", 'plane', 'crash', 'multi-car', 'pile-up', 'highway', 'accident', 'amusement', 'park', 'roller', 'coaster', 'ride', 'Final', 'Destination', 'series', 'become', 'famous', 'really', 'spectacular', 'sequences', 'involving', 'various', 'accidents', 'and/or', 'death', 'attempts', 'reclaim', 'victims', 'roller', 'coaster', 'scenario', 'certainly', 'stage', 'continuation', 'theme', 'note', 'interest', 'additional', 'possible', 'link', 'previous', 'films', 'form', ""'voice"", 'devil', 'entrance', 'one', 'amusement', 'park', 'rides', 'voice', 'Tony', 'Todd', 'who', 'also', 'played', 'undertaker', 'Mr.', 'Bludworth', 'first', 'two', 'Final', 'Destination', 'films', 'eerie', 'guy', 'who', 'know', 'too', 'much', 'whole', 'phenomenon', 'was', 'just', 'neat', 'bit', 'casting', 'actual', 'connection', 'voice', 'Bludworth', 'character', 'same', 'class', 'questions', 'Bludworth', 'were', 'subtext', 'previous', 'movies', 'there', 'waiting', 'be', 'explored', 'further', 'should', 'choose', 'do', 'so', 'future', 'first', 'Final', 'Destination', 'group', 'who', 'survived', 'were', 'members', 'high', 'school', 'class', 'who', 'knew', 'other', 'did', ""n't"", 'necesarily', 'get', 'along', 'grew', 'closer', 'faced', 'death', 'phenomenon', 'Final', 'Destination', '2', 'was', 'mostly', 'strangers', 'mostly', 'likable', 'characters', 'who', 'quickly', 'knit', 'cohesive', 'group', 'chapter', 'survivors', 'mostly', 'know', 'other', 'peripherally', 'contrast', 'first', 'two', 'movies', 'group', 'increasingly', 'odds', 'cases', 'hostile', 'events', 'escalate', 'noticing', 'deaths', 'happen', 'same', 'order', 'would', 'have', 'premonition', 'had', ""n't"", 'changed', 'things', 'one', 'character', 'even', 'up', 'idea', 'maybe', 'most', 'deaths', 'including', 'own', 'could', 'be', 'avoided', 'just', 'knocked', 'off', 'last', 'person', 'list', 'first', 'pursuit', 'death', 'phenomenon', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'only', 'threat', 'time', 'around', 'acting', 'usual', 'series', 'well', 'done', 'Amanda', 'Crew', 'fromThe', 'Haunting', 'Connecticut', 'Unrated', 'Special', 'Edition', 'personal', 'favorites', 'also', 'Wendy', 'younger', 'year', 'sister', 'Julie', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'fantastic.The', 'DVD', 'version', 'Final', 'Destination', '3', 'use', 'unique', 'Fate', 'option', 'where', 'viewer', 'will', 'periodically', 'make', 'decisions', 'characters', 'using', 'remote', 'actually', 'change', 'movie', 'Very', 'cool', 'feature', ""'m"", 'surprised', ""n't"", 'been', 'used', 'bit', 'more', 'often', 'would', 'lose', 'appeal', 'used', 'too', 'often', 'used', 'right', 'movie', 'now', 'then', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'certainly', 'more', 'appealing', 'next-generation', 'special', 'features', 'Blu-Ray', 'watching', 'movie', 'watching', ""'making"", 'same', 'time', 'separate', 'boxes.The', 'third', 'chapter', 'Final', 'Destination', 'series', ""n't"", 're-invent', 'wheel', 'series', 'just', 'existing', 'wheel', 'extremely', 'good', 'effect', 'extra', 'twists', 'turns', 'One', 'best', 'installments', 'great', 'series', ""'Choose"", 'Fate', 'option', 'extra', 'bonus', 'especially', 'repeat', 'viewing']",N/A

Of course no believes our lead until they come  close to death, in which case they decide to hear her out in hopes of saving their own asses. The movie is basically the first film all over again, with a minor mix of the second movie, once again trying to shock the audience, but in less than sensational deaths. Compared to the previous sequel, the deaths in this movie were really nothing. Though, in the flavor of the series, we're treated to an eye-full of gore-tastic deaths, which redeems the film from its drab plot-line. Despite all the trash talking, the movie did manage to entertain me, just not as much as the previous two. Although the deaths are not as extravagant or shocking, there were a couple that was unexpected. the story also seemed a little thin in comparison to the other two, which I also feel had more character development, where in this case I did not really care much for these people. Overall I think this is the weakest in thr trilogy, but it's expected considering the previous two were held high in high regards to entertainment and originality on my list. However, the movie does manage to squeeze in a couple unforseen death sequences, the rest however seemed rather tame compared to its predecessors. With a thinner than usual plot.

I can foresee some interesting things to be done in the near future expanding from this idea and the feature is worth a look, even if it gets kind of corny halfway through.The best thing about this disc is the ""Kill Shot"" making-of the film which is an all inclusive feature length documentary on the shoot.

Although, the most unpredictable part in the first one is when the little cutie gets hit by that bus!  Some of the rest of the movie was just funny and real predictable.  Then something made me watch it again on DVD.  I though a little more of it afterwards and then checked out the FD2.  I'm more into reality and I though the second installment was more in depth than the first and found that it also goes deeper into FD1 which made these two better together.  At the end, I knew it wasn't over (of course...) Finally, the third arrives.  Death on a roller coaster wasn't as thrilling as a plane explosion or even on the highway during rush hour.  Anyway, after Devil's Flight, the story falls flat with one whole scene about FD1 and nothing about Part Two.  When I thought about it, I said maybe FD3 was the idea they had before creating FD2 and that's why there's no mention of the events or charactors of FD2 in Part 3.  Sorry, I have no excuses, that was just a thought in my mind after seeing this huge disappointment.  During the dream sequence, let's face it, this movie would have ended if that fool hadn't of had the camcorder with him on the ride on top of getting it knocked out his hands!  After the dream sequence, the guy with the camcorder got off the ride to follow the dimespieces.  That accident, clearly, shouldn't have happened!  The hydrolic line, which is what brings down the safety bars and locks them while the ride is in motion, would not have broken and neither would the coaster track.  Just thought I would clear that up.  For those checking this review, I do have an imagination and if Death had revenge for those that cheated it, the forces that caused these unbelieveable events in Part 3 could happen.  This one just didn't match up to what happened in the first 2.  In my opinion, this one may have worked better as a PSP game.  I failed to mention that I didn't see this one at the movies, I got the DVD and it has the option to watch it with alternate scenes.  It would not have been better at all for me.  It is what it is and I don't care if I have this one in my collection.  I wish the director would've got kicked by that horse instead...

988053,A268EEWUXYCA8Q,B000FC2HRW,Terry Mesnard,"[1, 2]","Sometimes I feel weird explaining horror films I want to see. For instance, I had a horrible time explaining why I wanted to see Hostel. That and Saw has to be some of the hardest to explain to non-horror-film-ites. Friday, I was asked what my plans were for the weekend.  I said, I was planning to see Final Destination 3. When I said that, it was ""why would you want to see that?""And the response on the tip of my tongue was going to be ""to see the teens offed in darkly humorous ways"" but I stopped myself because I knew how that would sound. I mean, that is why I'm going to see it. Final Destination spooked me and made me jump and cringe due to the scary situations (getting strangled in your tub by wire to the point where your eyes turn red...that made me cringe in empathy) and Final Destination 2 made me laugh at the horrendously over-the-top ways Death plotted each person's demise. I laughed and said ""Wow!"" a couple times at the truly creative ways in which the real world could kill someone. Part of the fun in that movie was figuring out not ""if"" a person would be offed but how. It kept you guessing and played with your expectations.Director James Wong returns to helm the third film and makes a film that has some of the best and worst aspects of the first two.  He is a pretty decent technical director.  The camera angles are great as is the general cinematography.  To begin with, I thought the roller-coaster was a bit tame, compared to the horrific car accident and plane explosion of the first two films.  However, some of the deaths that follow it exemplify some of the best of cause and effect science laws where the littlest thing ends up causing so much destruction.The actors and characters are all pretty much stereotypes and cliches which actually makes the movie more enjoyable.  You know these people aren't real, you know that, in effect, you are watching cliches getting splattered and shot, instead of real people.The strength of the second film was how different each death was.  The third film has too many ""splat"" deaths.  They are and aren't as creative as the first two, if that makes sense, meaning if taken by themselves are creative, but looked at as a whole, they are too similar to each other.It also relies on too many cliches of the first two films.  The rustling wind, the protagonist slowly twirling around as if experiencing something the rest of us can't see.  The candles flickering when there's no breeze to flick them.  It got in the way of what we want to see.In the end, its a good entry in the series.  Sometimes it excels over the past two, but at times it drags under the contraints of the film.  I want to see a fourth film in which the people try to outsmart death, not wait around to see what It is going to do and then try to react.  Or, how about one of the characters, like the goth figure in this film, decide to take matters into his or her own hands and try and kill the last person who's supposed to die (as suggested in this film but never used)?  They need something new to inject into the series to keep it going past its one shot premise.A good film, sometimes better sometimes worse than its prequels, but overall a fun way to spend an evening...if watching heads splat and teens fake bake themselves to death is your cup of tea.",4,Great and horrible at the same time,1139788800,"02 13, 2006",2006,3305,"['Sometimes', 'feel', 'weird', 'explaining', 'horror', 'films', 'want', 'see', 'instance', 'had', 'horrible', 'time', 'explaining', 'why', 'wanted', 'see', 'Hostel', 'Saw', 'be', 'hardest', 'explain', 'non-horror-film-ites', 'Friday', 'was', 'asked', 'what', 'plans', 'were', 'weekend', 'said', 'was', 'planning', 'see', 'Final', 'Destination', '3', 'When', 'said', 'was', 'why', 'would', 'want', 'see', 'response', 'tip', 'tongue', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'see', 'teens', 'offed', 'darkly', 'humorous', 'ways', 'stopped', 'knew', 'how', 'would', 'sound', 'mean', 'why', ""'m"", 'going', 'see', 'Final', 'Destination', 'spooked', 'made', 'jump', 'cringe', 'due', 'scary', 'situations', 'getting', 'strangled', 'tub', 'wire', 'point', 'where', 'eyes', 'turn', 'red', 'made', 'cringe', 'empathy', 'Final', 'Destination', '2', 'made', 'laugh', 'horrendously', 'over-the-top', 'ways', 'Death', 'plotted', 'person', 'demise', 'laughed', 'said', 'Wow', 'couple', 'times', 'truly', 'creative', 'ways', 'real', 'world', 'could', 'kill', 'someone', 'Part', 'fun', 'movie', 'was', 'figuring', 'out', 'not', 'person', 'would', 'be', 'offed', 'how', 'kept', 'guessing', 'played', 'expectations.Director', 'James', 'Wong', 'helm', 'third', 'film', 'film', 'best', 'worst', 'aspects', 'first', 'two', 'pretty', 'decent', 'technical', 'director', 'camera', 'angles', 'are', 'great', 'general', 'cinematography', 'begin', 'thought', 'roller-coaster', 'was', 'bit', 'tame', 'compared', 'horrific', 'car', 'accident', 'plane', 'explosion', 'first', 'two', 'films', 'However', 'deaths', 'follow', 'best', 'cause', 'effect', 'science', 'laws', 'where', 'littlest', 'thing', 'up', 'causing', 'so', 'much', 'destruction.The', 'actors', 'characters', 'are', 'pretty', 'much', 'stereotypes', 'cliches', 'actually', 'movie', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'know', 'people', 'are', ""n't"", 'real', 'know', 'effect', 'are', 'watching', 'cliches', 'getting', 'splattered', 'shot', 'instead', 'real', 'people.The', 'strength', 'second', 'film', 'was', 'how', 'different', 'death', 'was', 'third', 'film', 'too', 'many', 'splat', 'deaths', 'are', 'are', ""n't"", 'as', 'creative', 'first', 'two', 'sense', 'meaning', 'taken', 'are', 'creative', 'looked', 'whole', 'are', 'too', 'similar', 'other.It', 'also', 'too', 'many', 'cliches', 'first', 'two', 'films', 'rustling', 'wind', 'protagonist', 'slowly', 'twirling', 'around', 'experiencing', 'something', 'rest', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'candles', 'flickering', 'when', 'breeze', 'flick', 'got', 'way', 'what', 'want', 'see.In', 'end', 'good', 'entry', 'series', 'past', 'two', 'times', 'contraints', 'film', 'want', 'see', 'fourth', 'film', 'people', 'try', 'outsmart', 'death', 'not', 'wait', 'see', 'what', 'going', 'do', 'then', 'try', 'react', 'how', 'one', 'characters', 'goth', 'figure', 'film', 'decide', 'take', 'matters', 'own', 'hands', 'try', 'kill', 'last', 'person', 'who', 'supposed', 'die', 'suggested', 'film', 'never', 'used', 'need', 'something', 'new', 'inject', 'series', 'keep', 'going', 'one', 'shot', 'premise.A', 'good', 'film', 'sometimes', 'better', 'sometimes', 'worse', 'prequels', 'fun', 'way', 'spend', 'evening', 'watching', 'heads', 'splat', 'teens', 'fake', 'bake', 'death', 'cup', 'tea']",N/A

The deaths are amped up a little higher than FD2, and so is the gore. (There is buckets of it) there are some good comedy moments peppered in and the acting from everyone is pretty good. However like the previous two films the death scenes are the reason to see this movie and in that department ""Final Destination 3"" excels. On the DVD there is a cool feature called ""Choose Their Fate"" where you can watch the movie, and at key points in the film you are able to make a decision for the characters that may affect the movie. For example the first choice is ""Heads or Tails"" if you choose ""heads"" you see the movie as it was in the theater, but if you select ""tails"" the movie takes a different path with new footage, and in some of the situations, entirely new death scenes.

988055,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B000FC2HRW,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[3, 7]","If you are sitting in a nearly empty theater, with a dozen other people, and you have a premonition you are about to waste 90 minutes of your life, head for the nearest exit. In all likelihood, your premonition will be correct.Okay, I'll admit it. I liked the first ""Final Destination"". It took a tired, old, over-worked premise, the horror film in which dumb teenagers get killed, and added a little twist to it, elaborate Rube Goldberg-esque murders. It was like watching a game of ""Mousetrap"", only with murder. The unique thing about the first film is that many of these `contraptions' ended with a quick cut, just as the victim is about to fall prey, allowing our mind to fill in the blanks. The filmmakers mixed these less gruesome, elaborate machinations with quick, brutal murders, keeping the viewer on their toes, always guessing.""2"" was a mess. A retread with more gruesome elements, robbing the film of any of the interesting work found in the first.""3"", directed by James Wong, an alumnus of ""The X-Files"", and co-creator (some might argue, perpetrator) of the first installment, attempts to use the mix of the first film while adding more gruesome elements, apparently to appease audiences who expect more and more graphic material. It just doesn't work. Part of what holds your interest in the first film is that you are never quite sure how someone will get offed. Some were gruesome. Some were elaborate. In ""3"", all of the methods are elaborate, but all are equally gruesome and graphic in detail. This provides the gore, but none of the shock.The acting? Irrelevant. A bunch of forgettable teenage actors, many of whom would be unable to get jobs on the WB, attempt to make their characters believable. But these attempts fail. Miserably. Then again, any one who goes to see this film isn't going to discover the next Meryl Streep. They want to see some teenagers get killed. That's what this genre is all about and it doesn't fail in that regard.But unlike the first film, it doesn't provide anything new. Yes, the teenagers are killed in different ways, but because they are all gruesome, the film doesn't have any of the surprise or interest the first entry had.Story? Ludicrous. Again, this isn't really the point of these films. An elaborate attempt is made to try to make the story believable. A young teenage girl has a premonition the roller coaster she is about to get on will have a terrible crash, killing her and all of the members of her senior class in the process. She screams and yells and they finally let her off, along with most of her senior class. Her boyfriend remains on the coaster. Soon, the car does jump the tracks and the remaining people all die. But what about the people who got off the ride? The girl soon realizes Death still wants them and will do whatever it can to get them, in the same order they should have died on the roller coaster. If they are able to save someone, Death skips them over and moves on to the next one. If you haven't stopped reading by now, due to the fact that you are laughing so hard at the ludicrous nature of the story, keep reading. The teenager is a photographer for the yearbook. Before they got on the ride, she took a lot of pictures of the Senior Class. As she realizes the survivors will soon die, she also realizes that there are clues to the deaths of the remaining survivors in the pictures. Oh no, not the pictures!The only thing that might have saved this film from the inevitable 99 cent rental bin at your local video store would be if they returned to the original formula of the first installment. Some elaborate murders with quick cuts, and some quick gruesome murders, leaving the viewer on their toes. Instead, they sort of combine both for this new installment, resulting in a predictably gruesome teenage blood fest. It seems sad that horror films have to be so gruesome, so bloody in this day and age. Whatever happened to the great films that left a lot of the horror to your imagination? These were much more effective and will stand the test of time. Instead, filmmakers now seem to feel it necessary to depict every gruesome detail for the viewer. Perhaps they feel that the viewer can no longer use their imagination and needs everything handed to them on a silver platter. When an image is left to your imagination it is usually scarier than anything a filmmaker could create, so let us think about it.Forgettable.Come on, you weren't going to see this were you?

Forget the plot; forget the characters; just show how teenagers get killed off in the most bizarre fashion. And their deaths are sometimes so bizarre that they even provoke laughter. You may call it bad taste, but `Final Destination 3' is a success as an entertainment. But what an entertainment!The premise is the same as that of the first and second `FD.' One teenager has a premonition that something terrible is going to happen. When it really does, those who narrowly escaped get killed mysteriously one after another as if proving that no one can cheat Death.The difference of `Final Destination 3' is that something terrible means a deadly roller coaster ride, and that the photos taken by the heroine are a kind of key to solve the mystery. Though the premise is no longer fresh, the deaths (mostly very contrived) are presented with tight, snappy editing, and lots of gore, same amount of the second installation of the `FD' series. We should give due credit to director James Wong, who surely knows what he is doing.But the conclusion, which is reportedly re-shot, is not still satisfactory (I thought there's more to it), and the idea of these strange photos, which are borrowed from `Omen,' are a bit clumsily done. At least its brief reference to 9/11 should be removed if the film really wants to stay where it is, dark fantasy where deaths are presented in the most unrealistic way. And where is Tony Todd? I heard his voice, but couldn't see him.There is a good reason for the continuing success of the series on the US box office chart, and `FD3' lives up to the expectation from the audiences, which is getting higher. There would be another `final' destination, which sounds self-contradictory, but is still very probable.",3,"""You Can Ride, But You Can't Hide': Same Story with More Jaw-Dropping Deaths",1162339200,"11 1, 2006",2006,1860,"['critics', 'say', 'rightly', 'not', 'true', 'Final', 'Destination', 'franchise', 'providing', 'what', 'want', 'Forget', 'plot', 'forget', 'characters', 'just', 'show', 'how', 'teenagers', 'get', 'killed', 'off', 'most', 'bizarre', 'fashion', 'deaths', 'are', 'sometimes', 'so', 'bizarre', 'even', 'provoke', 'laughter', 'may', 'call', 'bad', 'taste', 'Final', 'Destination', '3', 'success', 'entertainment', 'what', 'entertainment', 'premise', 'same', 'first', 'second', 'FD', 'One', 'teenager', 'premonition', 'something', 'terrible', 'going', 'happen', 'When', 'really', 'who', 'narrowly', 'escaped', 'get', 'killed', 'mysteriously', 'one', 'proving', 'one', 'can', 'cheat', 'Death.The', 'difference', 'Final', 'Destination', '3', 'something', 'terrible', 'deadly', 'roller', 'coaster', 'ride', 'photos', 'taken', 'heroine', 'are', 'kind', 'key', 'solve', 'mystery', 'premise', 'no', 'longer', 'fresh', 'deaths', 'mostly', 'very', 'contrived', 'are', 'presented', 'tight', 'snappy', 'editing', 'lots', 'gore', 'same', 'amount', 'second', 'installation', 'FD', 'series', 'should', 'give', 'due', 'credit', 'director', 'James', 'Wong', 'who', 'surely', 'what', 'doing.But', 'conclusion', 'reportedly', 're-shot', 'not', 'still', 'satisfactory', 'thought', 'more', 'idea', 'strange', 'photos', 'are', 'borrowed', 'Omen', 'are', 'bit', 'clumsily', 'done', 'least', 'brief', 'reference', '9/11', 'should', 'be', 'removed', 'film', 'really', 'stay', 'where', 'dark', 'fantasy', 'where', 'deaths', 'are', 'presented', 'most', 'unrealistic', 'way', 'where', 'Tony', 'Todd', 'heard', 'voice', 'could', ""n't"", 'see', 'him.There', 'good', 'reason', 'continuing', 'success', 'series', 'US', 'box', 'office', 'chart', 'FD3', 'expectation', 'audiences', 'getting', 'higher', 'would', 'be', 'final', 'destination', 'self-contradictory', 'still', 'very', 'probable']",N/A

One of them is a photographer for the school paper and starts to notice strange things in the photographs she takes. (For instance the ride that said 'high die' instead of 'high dive') Her friends decide that they want to go on the rollercoaster and although the photographer isn't sure about it, she decides to go on it as well. I was so scared when the rollercoaster started to move. That part was really good because it definitely built up some tension and as soon as the rollercoaster went down the drop, things really started to get nasty. (In a good way though!)The death scenes in this film are incredibly gory. There nastier than the first film. (Again, in a good way!) My favourite death scene had to be the one of those two girls on the sunbeds as that part truly terrified me and had me on the edge of my seat.

Yes the acting is bad, but the death scenes keep you on your toes..  This is probably my favorite of the series, only because of the death scenes.  FD2 was only good because of the Highway Accident scene.  Best death scene ever made.  If you like the first two, you'll most likely like this one.  I am looking forward to the day it comes out and I'm going to be the first one in line to buy it, well whenever I get to the store that is...It's a very good horror movie, and it does lack the creativity that was in the first movie, and maybe even in the 2nd one.  There isn't really a good plot but the death scenes make up for that making it the best of all three of them, especially the tanning bed scene.
