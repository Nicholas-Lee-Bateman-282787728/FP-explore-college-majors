682554,A1LBAC84TLIGAX,B00005TSMM,"ACEMAN1 ""HERE TO PISS YOU OFF""","[0, 0]","Balto II: Wolf Quest is much better than what people give it credit for. Many people were very mixed about this sequel as seen by this site's okay 3 out of 5 star average, IMDB's 5.6 out of 10, on Flixster it has 56% approval, etc. This is easily the best animated sequel I've ever seen, and even if you hate it you can't deny that it's a big cut above every straight-to-video Disney sequel and all of The Land Before Time sequels. I loved this film almost as much as the first film, but the first film wins overall.WHAT IT'S ABOUT: Every night Balto has strange dreams that seem to be telling him of some kind of destiny he is to experience. Then his girlfriend Jenna has puppies, and all but one of them looks just like her. That single pup named Aleu looks more like her father, which is not a good thing because even after the events in the first film, there are still members in the town of Nome, Alaska who treat Balto like crap for being part wolf. No one wants to adopt her, and when she learns of her heritage, she becomes angry with her father and runs away to discover herself. Then Balto goes out to find his daughter, and it ends up becoming a journey the two of them must share together, and as with the first film it becomes a rather thrilling adventure.MUSIC: Though not as good as the first film's, I still thoroughly enjoyed the musical score, and overall aside from that minor difference I have no complaints against it. Especially surprising is the fact the singing scenes are not God-awful as is the case with nearly all animated sequels. These scenes were actually enjoyable and not an excruciating form of torture.ACTING: They changed the voice-acting for pretty much all of the characters. However, these actors are fitting replacements for these characters. For the most part I have no complaints against the acting and all the actors fit their roles well.ACTION: The beginning is a tad boring, which is why this sequel loses the chance of being just as good as the first film. After that however, it becomes very entertaining and rather thrilling when it wanted to be. I have to admit though, the humor isn't present as often as it was in the first film which is also a bit of downer. However, this is still consistently entertaining and rarely boring.OVERALL: Come on people! This sequel is nowhere near as bad you make it out to be! This is a review coming from a person who rarely enjoys animated sequels (So many bad Disney sequels, so many bad memories...), but by God I am an adamant defender of this sequel which I find to be one of the most unfairly victimized sequels this side of efforts such as All Dogs Go To Heaven 2, Jaws 2, Scream 2 and 3, The Rescuers Down Under, etc. I found this to be a great film deserves a helluva lot more than it got.THE GOOD: Great voice-acting, good story, great music, thrilling action moments.THE BAD: The beginning is a tad boring and there isn't as much humor.",5,A GREAT SEQUEL TO A GREAT FILM  9.25 OUT OF 10,1267833600,"03 6, 2010",2010,2932,"['Balto', 'II', 'Wolf', 'Quest', 'much', 'better', 'what', 'people', 'give', 'credit', 'Many', 'people', 'were', 'very', 'mixed', 'sequel', 'seen', 'site', 'okay', '3', '5', 'star', 'average', 'IMDB', '5.6', '10', 'Flixster', '56', '%', 'approval', 'etc', 'easily', 'best', 'animated', 'sequel', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'even', 'hate', 'ca', ""n't"", 'deny', 'big', 'cut', 'straight-to-video', 'Disney', 'sequel', 'Land', 'Time', 'sequels', 'loved', 'film', 'almost', 'as', 'much', 'first', 'film', 'first', 'film', 'IT', 'ABOUT', 'Every', 'night', 'Balto', 'strange', 'dreams', 'seem', 'be', 'telling', 'kind', 'destiny', 'experience', 'Then', 'girlfriend', 'Jenna', 'puppies', 'one', 'just', 'single', 'pup', 'named', 'Aleu', 'more', 'father', 'not', 'good', 'thing', 'even', 'events', 'first', 'film', 'are', 'still', 'members', 'town', 'Nome', 'Alaska', 'who', 'treat', 'Balto', 'crap', 'being', 'part', 'wolf', 'one', 'adopt', 'when', 'heritage', 'angry', 'father', 'away', 'discover', 'Then', 'Balto', 'out', 'find', 'daughter', 'up', 'becoming', 'journey', 'two', 'must', 'share', 'together', 'first', 'film', 'rather', 'thrilling', 'adventure.MUSIC', 'Though', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'first', 'film', 'still', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'musical', 'score', 'overall', 'aside', 'minor', 'difference', 'have', 'complaints', 'Especially', 'surprising', 'fact', 'singing', 'scenes', 'are', 'not', 'God-awful', 'case', 'nearly', 'animated', 'sequels', 'scenes', 'were', 'actually', 'enjoyable', 'not', 'excruciating', 'form', 'torture.ACTING', 'changed', 'voice-acting', 'pretty', 'much', 'characters', 'However', 'actors', 'are', 'fitting', 'replacements', 'characters', 'most', 'part', 'have', 'complaints', 'acting', 'actors', 'fit', 'roles', 'well.ACTION', 'beginning', 'tad', 'boring', 'why', 'sequel', 'chance', 'being', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'first', 'film', 'however', 'very', 'entertaining', 'rather', 'thrilling', 'when', 'wanted', 'be', 'have', 'admit', 'humor', ""n't"", 'present', 'as', 'often', 'was', 'first', 'film', 'also', 'bit', 'downer', 'However', 'still', 'consistently', 'entertaining', 'rarely', 'boring.OVERALL', 'Come', 'people', 'sequel', 'nowhere', 'near', 'bad', 'make', 'be', 'review', 'coming', 'person', 'who', 'rarely', 'animated', 'sequels', 'So', 'many', 'bad', 'Disney', 'sequels', 'so', 'many', 'bad', 'memories', 'God', 'am', 'adamant', 'defender', 'sequel', 'find', 'be', 'one', 'most', 'unfairly', 'victimized', 'sequels', 'side', 'efforts', 'such', 'Dogs', 'Go', 'Heaven', '2', 'Jaws', '2', 'Scream', '2', '3', 'Rescuers', 'Down', 'etc', 'found', 'be', 'great', 'film', 'helluva', 'lot', 'more', 'got.THE', 'GOOD', 'Great', 'voice-acting', 'good', 'story', 'great', 'music', 'thrilling', 'action', 'moments.THE', 'BAD', 'beginning', 'tad', 'boring', ""n't"", 'as', 'much', 'humor']",N/A

682558,AIEEK7AHXKZCC,B00005TSMM,BeatleBangs1964,"[3, 4]","Balto was the wolf-husky who led the last leg of a husky-malamute team some 53 miles in 1925 during the Diptheria Epidemic.  The beautiful Eskimo dog has been immortalized in statue as a testament to his bravery in getting the team through so the medicine could be provided to the people needing it.Although this fictionalized account of Balto's life off duty is just that, it does have some appealing qualities.  The animation of Balto's mate, the beautiful husky Jenna; Balto's lineage revealing him to be a wolf-hybrid and the story of his beautiful, curly-tailed daughter, Aleu are all literary license that make the story appealing.Although many disliked this film, it is deeper than it appears on the surface.  Aleu is the only one of the Jenna-Balto union who is not adopted.  Her siblings could pass for dogs.  She is the one who looks like her wolf paternal grandmother; she is the one with the howl of the wolf, the body of the wolf and the curly tail of Jenna.  Once she learns she is 1/4 wolf, she is devastated.  Balto has to break the news to her about why nobody picked her.  Even so, Aleu tries to pass for a husky.  She denies her lupine heritage.Aleu does bring to mind the 1934 and 1959 remake of ""Imitation of Life,"" the story of a girl who passes for white and denies her black mother.  The theme of passing has been expounded upon in many books and movies.  ""Pinky,"" and ""Lost Boundaries,"" two 1949 films explore this highly charged topic as does ""Devil in a Blue Dress,"" 1972's ""Trick Baby;"" the 1996 movie, ""A Family Thing"" and, more recently, ""The Human Stain.""  Sadly, racism in society does prompt many to make this decision, which often affords people jobs and social openings they might not otherwise have.  That is a sad comment in today's world.  One would hope more progressive thinking has prevailed so as to abolish racism and the need any might feel to take this step.Aleu does bear a strong resemblance characterwise to the young woman in ""Imitation of Life;"" using a wolf-husky character offers some ""distancing"" when introducing this very serious topic.  The wolf-husky can indeed be viewed as a metaphor for passing to ""get ahead.""  Aleu sees no benefit to being part wolf; after all, it is her lupine appearance that made her ""unadoptable"" by human standards.After some dangerous travails and travels, father and daughter connect and in time their issues are neatly ironed out as would be expected in an animated film.  The part that I found most worthwhile was the issue of passing - the beautiful curly tailed wolf-husky felt she had to ""pass"" and deny part of her heritage - that could be a metaphor for what many people have done in order to get ahead.  The very need to pass at all is a sad comment on an aspect of society.  Still, I think this is a rather decent film with decent music.  I loved the wolves and dogs.",3,Not Like the Real Balto,1161907200,"10 27, 2006",2006,2862,"['Balto', 'was', 'wolf-husky', 'who', 'led', 'last', 'leg', 'husky-malamute', 'team', '53', 'miles', '1925', 'Diptheria', 'Epidemic', 'beautiful', 'Eskimo', 'dog', 'been', 'immortalized', 'statue', 'testament', 'bravery', 'getting', 'team', 'medicine', 'could', 'be', 'provided', 'people', 'needing', 'fictionalized', 'account', 'Balto', 'life', 'duty', 'just', 'have', 'appealing', 'qualities', 'animation', 'Balto', 'mate', 'beautiful', 'husky', 'Jenna', 'Balto', 'lineage', 'revealing', 'be', 'wolf-hybrid', 'story', 'beautiful', 'curly-tailed', 'daughter', 'Aleu', 'are', 'literary', 'license', 'make', 'story', 'many', 'disliked', 'film', 'deeper', 'surface', 'Aleu', 'only', 'one', 'Jenna-Balto', 'union', 'who', 'not', 'adopted', 'siblings', 'could', 'pass', 'dogs', 'one', 'who', 'wolf', 'paternal', 'grandmother', 'one', 'howl', 'wolf', 'body', 'wolf', 'curly', 'tail', 'Jenna', '1/4', 'wolf', 'devastated', 'Balto', 'break', 'news', 'why', 'nobody', 'picked', 'Even', 'so', 'Aleu', 'pass', 'husky', 'lupine', 'heritage.Aleu', 'bring', 'mind', '1934', '1959', 'remake', 'Imitation', 'Life', 'story', 'girl', 'who', 'white', 'black', 'mother', 'theme', 'passing', 'been', 'expounded', 'many', 'books', 'movies', 'Pinky', 'Lost', 'Boundaries', 'two', '1949', 'films', 'explore', 'highly', 'charged', 'topic', 'Devil', 'Blue', 'Dress', '1972', 'Trick', 'Baby', '1996', 'movie', 'Family', 'Thing', 'more', 'recently', 'Human', 'Stain', 'Sadly', 'racism', 'society', 'prompt', 'many', 'make', 'decision', 'often', 'people', 'jobs', 'social', 'openings', 'might', 'not', 'otherwise', 'have', 'sad', 'comment', 'today', 'world', 'One', 'would', 'hope', 'more', 'progressive', 'thinking', 'prevailed', 'so', 'abolish', 'racism', 'need', 'might', 'feel', 'take', 'step.Aleu', 'bear', 'strong', 'resemblance', 'characterwise', 'young', 'woman', 'Imitation', 'Life', 'using', 'wolf-husky', 'character', 'distancing', 'when', 'introducing', 'very', 'serious', 'topic', 'wolf-husky', 'can', 'indeed', 'be', 'viewed', 'metaphor', 'passing', 'get', 'ahead', 'Aleu', 'benefit', 'being', 'part', 'wolf', 'lupine', 'appearance', 'made', 'unadoptable', 'human', 'standards.After', 'dangerous', 'travails', 'travels', 'father', 'daughter', 'connect', 'time', 'issues', 'are', 'neatly', 'ironed', 'out', 'would', 'be', 'expected', 'animated', 'film', 'part', 'found', 'most', 'worthwhile', 'was', 'issue', 'passing', 'beautiful', 'curly', 'tailed', 'wolf-husky', 'felt', 'had', 'pass', 'deny', 'part', 'heritage', 'could', 'be', 'metaphor', 'what', 'many', 'people', 'have', 'done', 'order', 'get', 'ahead', 'very', 'need', 'pass', 'sad', 'comment', 'aspect', 'society', 'Still', 'think', 'rather', 'decent', 'film', 'decent', 'music', 'loved', 'wolves', 'dogs']",N/A

I honestly don't know why many don't like the movie, you just have to remember that unlike the first it was lower budget being a straight to TV release rather than made for theater. As for the beliefs that it shows that for some reason gets many bent out of shape, especially the Christians apparently, well all I have to say is that I am a Christian too and I honestly have no issues with it. Native American beliefs have always intrigued me and you have to remember that there are other views in this world than just yours and so long as they don't promote immorality (which this one does not) then why worry too much about it. In the long run I think if you shelter kids too much it is bad for them because they will be completely unprepared to face the world when they get older.Back to the movie though. You will notice it has different artists and different voices, but honestly when I think of Balto the voice in this movie is the one I think of and in my opinion suits him better for this movie. To me in the first one he sounded younger and more reckless(which he was) and in the second he sounds to me more experienced and fatherly which suits him better here. As for one negative review I heard about Alue acting the way she does and being so disrespectful toward Balto on several occasions... Well I challenge you to tell me any teen who is not. They made her feel more like a real teen rather than some transparent fictional character and I dare say that when the children whom you worry about being 'influenced' by it become teens themselves they will act similarly rather you allow them to watch or not, it is just how teens are.

However, on the parental side, Balto has a very difficult time allowing his baby girl to explore and grow...he means well and is protective and loving, but a bit stifling.I like the message that everyone has a place in the Universe regardless of heritage. This is an important message. Yes, there are basic American Indian themes here which I find very cool even though I am Christian and do not ascribe to some of the concepts presented. I do, however, believe that a message wherein the earth, it's creatures, and the environment is respected is a good one to foster.I also get a major kick out of two of the male voice actors used for the wolves: Mark Hamill and David Carradine! This is a pair I'd wanted to see do something jointly for years but never thought I'd actually get that wish granted and in exactly the opposite manner than expected. I was pleasantly surprised. I also admired how the Alpha allowed all the right to express their opinions even though he knew there were detractors among the pack. Showed he was wise, caring, and fair. The Alpha also refused to abandon the seeming Beta, Niju, which refused to leave the homeland so that he may survive. Other themes presented are longsufference and compassion.It also seemed to have a slight vibe of equal rights between the sexes which I don't feel was overstated.Overall, worth seeing.",4,Balto II: Spoilers,1249430400,"08 5, 2009",2009,1834,"[""'ll"", 'grant', 'most', 'part', 'was', ""n't"", 'overly', 'impressed', 'quality', 'animation', 'here', 'Also', 'moments', 'Aleu', 'Papa', 'are', 'bit', 'rude', 'lass', 'teenhood', 'stage', 'say', 'do', 'things', 'regret', 'especially', 'time', 'tremendous', 'changes', 'perceptions', 'self', 'world', 'realistic', 'However', 'wish', 'Aleu', 'had', 'apologized', 'lapses', 'am', '27', 'still', 'apologize', 'dad', 'when', 'get', 'line', 'matter', 'respect', 'However', 'parental', 'side', 'Balto', 'very', 'difficult', 'time', 'allowing', 'baby', 'girl', 'explore', 'grow', 'well', 'protective', 'loving', 'bit', 'stifling.I', 'message', 'everyone', 'place', 'Universe', 'regardless', 'heritage', 'important', 'message', 'Yes', 'are', 'basic', 'American', 'Indian', 'themes', 'here', 'find', 'very', 'cool', 'even', 'am', 'Christian', 'do', 'not', 'ascribe', 'concepts', 'presented', 'do', 'however', 'believe', 'message', 'earth', 'creatures', 'environment', 'respected', 'good', 'one', 'foster.I', 'also', 'get', 'major', 'kick', 'two', 'male', 'voice', 'actors', 'used', 'wolves', 'Mark', 'Hamill', 'David', 'Carradine', 'pair', ""'d"", 'wanted', 'see', 'do', 'something', 'jointly', 'years', 'never', 'thought', ""'d"", 'actually', 'get', 'wish', 'granted', 'exactly', 'opposite', 'manner', 'expected', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'also', 'admired', 'how', 'Alpha', 'allowed', 'right', 'express', 'opinions', 'even', 'knew', 'were', 'detractors', 'pack', 'Showed', 'was', 'wise', 'caring', 'fair', 'Alpha', 'also', 'refused', 'abandon', 'seeming', 'Beta', 'Niju', 'refused', 'leave', 'homeland', 'so', 'may', 'survive', 'Other', 'themes', 'presented', 'are', 'longsufference', 'compassion.It', 'also', 'seemed', 'have', 'slight', 'vibe', 'equal', 'rights', 'sexes', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'was', 'overstated.Overall', 'worth', 'seeing']",N/A

Sure, it's an okay movie .. but it has several faults to it in my eyes .. smaller children might just adore this movie as much as they did the first Balto.The animation in this .. the new animators you can clearly tell just aren't that good or are extremely lazy. I can say 100% they could've done an weller job at making this movie than what they just did here. the wolves are deformed ..Another thing is i find the plot a bit corny. Balto and Jenna have a litter of pups and all of them were sold except for Aleu, the one who looked most wolf out of them all [ since balto is part wolf and jenna is pure siberian. ]. Well, when she finds out that she is part wolf, she throws a wild fit and goes out to "" find who she really is. "" On her journey, she finds that her spirit guide is a MOUSE. yes, a MOUSE. out of all things, this part husky, part wolf's spirit guide is a mouse .. ! Balto comes and follows her, they come across a wolf pack and meet four deadly wolves in a giant wolf pack. One of these wolves is like, an overweight, one is fleabitten, the other .. i don't even know what to say about him .. and one is just the leader of the small gathering. The whole pack is really led by an elder wolf. Their food runs out, aleu finds out that it's across the ocean or whichever .. and yeah, aleu leaves with the wolf pack and becomes the alpha female.When Balto leaves Aleu with the pack and such, he finds that Aniu, the white wolf is his mother for like .. a split second before he leaves. And that's the end ..Personally, i wouldn't want to get this movie for myself. Hardly any of the old characters are in it, Aleu is a stubborn mutt .. and Balto's personality went through a major change ..",2,Eh ( Can be a spolier ),1105142400,"01 8, 2005",2005,1812,"['absoulutley', 'loved', 'first', 'Balto', 'movie', 'was', 'great', 'warming', 'tale', '..But', '..', 'just', 'different', 'Sure', 'okay', 'movie', '..', 'several', 'faults', 'eyes', '..', 'smaller', 'children', 'might', 'just', 'adore', 'movie', 'as', 'much', 'did', 'first', 'Balto.The', 'animation', 'new', 'animators', 'can', 'clearly', 'tell', 'just', 'are', ""n't"", 'that', 'good', 'are', 'extremely', 'lazy', 'can', 'say', '100', '%', 'could', ""'ve"", 'done', 'weller', 'job', 'making', 'movie', 'what', 'just', 'did', 'here', 'wolves', 'are', 'deformed', '..Another', 'thing', 'i', 'find', 'plot', 'bit', 'corny', 'Balto', 'Jenna', 'have', 'litter', 'pups', 'were', 'sold', 'Aleu', 'one', 'who', 'looked', 'most', 'wolf', '[', 'balto', 'part', 'wolf', 'jenna', 'pure', 'siberian', ']', 'Well', 'when', 'out', 'part', 'wolf', 'wild', 'fit', 'out', 'find', 'who', 'really', 'is.', 'journey', 'spirit', 'guide', 'MOUSE', 'yes', 'MOUSE', 'things', 'part', 'husky', 'part', 'wolf', 'spirit', 'guide', 'mouse', '..', 'Balto', 'come', 'wolf', 'pack', 'meet', 'four', 'deadly', 'wolves', 'giant', 'wolf', 'pack', 'One', 'wolves', 'overweight', 'one', 'fleabitten', 'other', '..', 'i', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'what', 'say', '..', 'one', 'just', 'leader', 'small', 'gathering', 'whole', 'pack', 'really', 'led', 'elder', 'wolf', 'food', 'out', 'aleu', 'out', 'ocean', 'whichever', '..', 'yeah', 'aleu', 'wolf', 'pack', 'alpha', 'female.When', 'Balto', 'Aleu', 'pack', 'such', 'Aniu', 'white', 'wolf', 'mother', '..', 'split', 'second', 'end', '..Personally', 'i', 'would', ""n't"", 'want', 'get', 'movie', 'Hardly', 'old', 'characters', 'are', 'Aleu', 'stubborn', 'mutt', '..', 'Balto', 'personality', 'went', 'major', 'change', '..']",N/A
682570,A2HOI4JAQDNPS,B00005TSMM,Mother Brown,"[1, 1]","We like Balto 2 a lot -- even without having seen Balto 1.  Our local library only has Balto 2.  But we have watched it probably about 8 times by now, and it holds her attention every time.  I find it a lot less annoying than most kids animated movies (such as most Disney).  It does have some pretty scary scenes, which young kids will definitely need some kind of adult guidance to work through -- for instance, a bear with red eyes suddenly appears and attacks Alue; and there are some fierce wolves, both spirit wolves and real wolves.  You need to judge whether your child is ready for the idea that the world can be scary.  I don't think it's more scary than, say, Malificent in Sleeping Beauty, and actually I think it's less scary than Snow White, which I haven't yet let my daughter watch; or Dumbo, which I hate.  The scariness of ""Balto 2"" is about the wild, the idea that there might be monsters or demons out there, which could also be within us; it's not about the even scarier idea that even those we love and trust, like the mother, could be bad; the stepmother theme; or that the mother could be killed or taken away, as in Babar. And it's not misogynistic.  And  it's not as loud as most Disney, and not so dependent on cutesy characters (there's an annoying goose, but he has a relatively, blessedly, small part).  But it does have some scary scenes all the same; this isn't a movie to leave a young child to watch for the first time alone.  But my daughter seems to have found it very sustaining for her imagination; she's always talking about the spirit animals coming to life, and about how to escape from a spirit bear.  I like the fact that it has a semi-cheesy but kind of appealing native American philosophy, about the one-ness of nature and finding your own true identity. The theme of a child trying to find her own self is one that matters to all children, and in fact all people.  I also like that, unlike in Disney princess movies, it's not a rescue plot: it's about the daughter, with her father's help, finding her own path, not about a prince/fairy godmother coming to the rescue of a passive heroine.  The songs are kind of cheesy, but we both enjoy them.  My daughter likes the fact that it is all dogs and wolves and animals, not people; it's a good movie for animal-loving kids.  Actually I like that too.  Nicely drawn, good voices; all in all, great kids movie.

However, I think it's still a good sequel : the story is fine (if not compared to the first), the backgrounds are beautiful, and the musics are excellent in several scenes. Usually I hate the songs from those DTV sequels, but here they aren't annoying and even worth listening. The only bad point I would give is the animation itself, which is really bad in a few scenes and looks more like a TV show (ie the bear scene...), but as I said it is often the case with DTV sequels. Also, the characters look and act a bit differently from the first. But from a general point of view, it's still an enjoyable quest, and I think it could have been much worse...So, a good direct-to-video, perhaps one of the best, but not at the level of the original. If you liked the first Balto, then you should at least rent B2.
