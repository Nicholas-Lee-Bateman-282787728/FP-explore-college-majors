1442685,A1LHVIU8KL5S9T,B0055E64FG,"Christopher William Jack ""megavengeanceman""","[21, 22]","Charles Bronson was a big star in Europe before he broke in the U.S. with these two films, the east meets west western Red Sun and  Sergio Leone's classic Once Upon A Time in the West. I've read somewhere that Mr. Bronson did not like to watch his own movies but he did admit to being partial to the aforementioned Red Sun and the little seen French New Wave-ish-Noir-mystery-thriller Rider on the Rain. It really is a one of a kind picture: Moody, atmospheric, odd, unsettling at times but strangely compelling and ultimately satisfying. Not much real action per se but a very 1960's feeling Hitchcock like imitation with its own kooky rhythms and style. His performance in this and in the companion picture on this dvd, Farewell Friend feature a decidedly less typical Bronson: Looser, cooler, casual, unaffected  and kind of well...hip for a guy his age in the 1960's anyway. Farewell Friend is maybe a little too pretentious for my taste but it has its' moments. It's well shot with lots of swinging looking 60's chicks in that Austin Powers like gear and Bronson's pretty good humored in it. I for one am glad to own a copy of Rider on the Rain finally in any form and this appears to be a good enough treatment. Not much in the extra department aside from some trailers but again I'm just glad the movie's are available in a decent format.",5,Rider on the Rain: Tragically Underrated,1311033600,"07 19, 2011",2011,1345,"['Charles', 'Bronson', 'was', 'big', 'star', 'Europe', 'broke', 'U.S.', 'two', 'films', 'east', 'meets', 'west', 'western', 'Red', 'Sun', 'Sergio', 'Leone', 'classic', 'Once', 'A', 'Time', 'West', ""'ve"", 'read', 'somewhere', 'Mr.', 'Bronson', 'did', 'not', 'watch', 'own', 'movies', 'did', 'admit', 'being', 'partial', 'aforementioned', 'Red', 'Sun', 'little', 'seen', 'French', 'New', 'Wave-ish-Noir-mystery-thriller', 'Rider', 'Rain', 'really', 'one', 'kind', 'picture', 'Moody', 'atmospheric', 'odd', 'unsettling', 'times', 'strangely', 'compelling', 'ultimately', 'satisfying', 'Not', 'much', 'real', 'action', 'se', 'very', '1960', 'feeling', 'Hitchcock', 'imitation', 'own', 'kooky', 'rhythms', 'style', 'performance', 'companion', 'picture', 'dvd', 'Farewell', 'Friend', 'feature', 'decidedly', 'less', 'typical', 'Bronson', 'Looser', 'cooler', 'casual', 'unaffected', 'kind', 'well', 'hip', 'guy', 'age', '1960', 'anyway', 'Farewell', 'Friend', 'maybe', 'little', 'too', 'pretentious', 'taste', 'moments', 'well', 'shot', 'lots', 'swinging', 'looking', '60', 'chicks', 'Austin', 'Powers', 'gear', 'Bronson', 'pretty', 'good', 'humored', 'one', 'am', 'glad', 'own', 'copy', 'Rider', 'Rain', 'finally', 'form', 'be', 'good', 'enough', 'treatment', 'Not', 'much', 'extra', 'department', 'aside', 'trailers', 'again', ""'m"", 'just', 'glad', 'movie', 'are', 'available', 'decent', 'format']",Rider on the Rain & farewell Friend

1442688,A3CE57YNGVWBQN,B0055E64FG,"Tom S. ""filmfan3""","[0, 0]","I just became aware of this double-feature DVD from an outfit called The Wild East, and I had to order it immediately. Not for Charles Bronson, although he is very good in both of these French films. The reason I had to have it was my favorite French mystery writer, Sebastien Japrisot (1931-2003). Early in his career, the late novelist (TRAP FOR CINDERELLA, A VERY LONG ENGAGEMENT, THE LADY IN THE CAR WITH GLASSES AND A GUN) wrote 2 original screenplays, and both films starred Bronson. Now, at last, both films are available here in decent widescreen prints, for a decent price. (Beware of online offers for really bad pirated versions of both titles.) And they're both in English--another plus. No subtitles!FAREWELL, FRIEND (Jean Herman,1968): Bronson stars with Alain Delon in this odd ""buddy movie"" about two former mercenaries who team up to help a shady lady (Olga Georges-Picot) break into her company's vault. But she says she doesn't want to rob it--she wants to put something back (???). Hmmm. Any sane person would smell a set-up, but these guys are blinded by her beauty, and one of them has a guilty secret that makes him feel he owes her the favor. When the two men get trapped in the vault over a long holiday weekend, the fun (and the danger) really begins. Japrisot's screenplay and the terrific byplay between the two stars are the highlights of this otherwise routine ""caper"" film.RIDER ON THE RAIN (Rene Clement, 1970): This is the real reason to get this DVD. The great French director, Rene Clement, teamed with Japrisot for this exciting, elegant, Hitchcockian thriller set in a small seaside village near Marseilles. A young wife (lovely French star Marlene Jobert), whose airline navigator husband is away, is sexually assaulted in her isolated home by a creepy man who rode in on the bus that afternoon. She manages to get to her husband's shotgun and kill the intruder. In a panic, she doesn't call the police, choosing instead to drive the body to the nearest cliff and dump it in the sea. She nearly gets away with it, too--until a mysterious American man (Bronson) arrives in the village. He seems to know all about everything that's happened, and he begins to follow and torment the woman. It seems the dead man was an escaped criminal with a big stash of stolen money in an airline bag, and now she has that bag. The psychological cat-and-mouse game between Bronson and Ms. Jobert intensifies, creating nearly 2 hours of suspense with several big surprises along the way. Clement's usual fine direction, the rain-drenched coastal setting, and the performances of the two stars are all very good reasons to see this, but the real star is Sebastien Japrisot. He was one of our finest mystery writers, and this is an excellent example of his brilliant, devious mind at work. RIDER ON THE RAIN is a must-see film for anyone who loves the best in suspense.Warning: I had some trouble with the main menu on this DVD--it doesn't seem to work properly. But a bit of fiddling with the controls on my remote finally got the corect movie going. You might have the same problem, but try hitting ""Enter"" once (for RIDER ON THE RAIN) or twice (for FAREWELL, FRIEND). It should work, eventually.

Risoli ""black farmer""","[17, 18]","Having written a review of ""Rider on the Rain"" in another DVD edition, and having bought the film three other times besides a copy taped from cable, it was never satisfyingly enough captured until this edition with the plus of ""Farewell Friend"" also.  Here is presented a widescreen anamorphic presentation of both films starring Charles Bronson and ""Rider"" has not looked so good since I had seen it in the theater in 1970.  ""Farewell Friend"" (AKA: ""Honor Among Thieves"") dated to 1968 and teams Bronson with Alain Delon (who re-teamed in the hit ""Red Sun"" in 1971) and also is written by one of my favorite authors, Sebastien Japrisot which I did not know until this DVD arrived.  I do not think Bronson's comeback did not reach the States until ""Rider on the Rain,"" but ""Farewell Friend"" claims to have been his breakthrough role.  ""Rider on the Rain"" also stars Marlene Jobert who I wish had done more as I find her role of ""Melancoly"" in this to be one of the most engaging screen characters I've come across and she plays it exquisitely.  She started her career in Jean Luc Godard's ""Masculine Feminine"" in 1966 and after ""Rider on the Rain"" she was not in anything recognizable.  A pity.  Sebastien Japrisot wrote ""Rider"" as well and he had another success of many recently with his novel, ""A Very Long Engagement.""  Joseph E. Levine was responsible for bringing ""Rider on the Rain"" to us and he was responsible for bringing cheap European spectacles to us like the ""Hercules"" films and used the money to finance films like ""8-1/2"" and ""Divorce, Italian Style"" and with his own company, Embassy Films, he produced for Paramount such films as ""The Carpetbaggers"" and ""Where Love Has Gone.""  ""Rider on the Rain"" was not a cheap spectacle as directed by Rene Clement, but a high quality piece of art, but has been sold to many outlets for distribution, and as I've testified previously, the last one I bought on DVD sounded like it was recorded underwater.  Rene Clement has never been as good with this film.  He is a director that film buffs should get to know as he consistently delivers.  His last film was the misunderstood, ""Wanted: Babysitter"" in 1975 recently released on DVD.  He died in 1996.  ""Rider"" is one of his masterpieces.  ""Farewell Friend"" was directed by Jean Herman.  It is truly a pleasant surprise to get these two films together with such a quality presentation by Wild East Productions.  This is Vol. 4 of their EuroCrime Collection and quite a stunner.  Thank you.",5,A Pleasant Surprise,1319414400,"10 24, 2011",2011,2494,"['Having', 'written', 'review', 'Rider', 'Rain', 'DVD', 'edition', 'having', 'bought', 'film', 'three', 'other', 'times', 'copy', 'taped', 'cable', 'was', 'never', 'satisfyingly', 'enough', 'captured', 'edition', 'plus', 'Farewell', 'Friend', 'also', 'Here', 'presented', 'widescreen', 'anamorphic', 'presentation', 'films', 'starring', 'Charles', 'Bronson', 'Rider', 'not', 'looked', 'so', 'good', 'had', 'seen', 'theater', '1970', 'Farewell', 'Friend', 'AKA', 'Honor', 'Thieves', 'dated', '1968', 'teams', 'Bronson', 'Alain', 'Delon', 'who', 're-teamed', 'hit', 'Red', 'Sun', '1971', 'also', 'written', 'one', 'favorite', 'authors', 'Sebastien', 'Japrisot', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'DVD', 'arrived', 'do', 'not', 'think', 'Bronson', 'comeback', 'did', 'not', 'reach', 'States', 'Rider', 'Rain', 'Farewell', 'Friend', 'claims', 'have', 'been', 'breakthrough', 'role', 'Rider', 'Rain', 'also', 'Marlene', 'Jobert', 'who', 'wish', 'had', 'done', 'more', 'find', 'role', 'Melancoly', 'be', 'one', 'most', 'engaging', 'screen', 'characters', ""'ve"", 'come', 'exquisitely', 'started', 'career', 'Jean', 'Luc', 'Godard', 'Masculine', 'Feminine', '1966', 'Rider', 'Rain', 'was', 'not', 'anything', 'recognizable', 'pity', 'Sebastien', 'Japrisot', 'wrote', 'Rider', 'well', 'had', 'success', 'many', 'recently', 'novel', 'Very', 'Long', 'Engagement', 'Joseph', 'E.', 'Levine', 'was', 'responsible', 'bringing', 'Rider', 'Rain', 'was', 'responsible', 'bringing', 'cheap', 'European', 'spectacles', 'Hercules', 'films', 'used', 'money', 'finance', 'films', '8-1/2', 'Divorce', 'Italian', 'Style', 'own', 'company', 'Embassy', 'Films', 'produced', 'Paramount', 'such', 'films', 'Carpetbaggers', 'Where', 'Love', 'Has', 'Gone', 'Rider', 'Rain', 'was', 'not', 'cheap', 'spectacle', 'directed', 'Rene', 'Clement', 'high', 'quality', 'piece', 'art', 'been', 'sold', 'many', 'outlets', 'distribution', ""'ve"", 'testified', 'previously', 'last', 'one', 'bought', 'DVD', 'sounded', 'was', 'recorded', 'underwater', 'Rene', 'Clement', 'never', 'been', 'good', 'film', 'director', 'film', 'buffs', 'should', 'get', 'know', 'consistently', 'last', 'film', 'was', 'misunderstood', 'Wanted', 'Babysitter', '1975', 'recently', 'released', 'DVD', 'died', '1996', 'Rider', 'one', 'masterpieces', 'Farewell', 'Friend', 'was', 'directed', 'Jean', 'Herman', 'truly', 'pleasant', 'surprise', 'get', 'two', 'films', 'together', 'such', 'quality', 'presentation', 'Wild', 'East', 'Productions', 'Vol', '4', 'EuroCrime', 'Collection', 'quite', 'stunner', 'Thank']",Rider on the Rain & farewell Friend
