This man has so much talent that it just isn't fair that he is also so pleasing to the eye.  But I also found the supporting actors quite compelling in this film about a sort of emotional vampire -- a man who must feed on women who love him.  Does seem like he should have had a couple of extra women around, though, in case there is a problem with one.  At any rate, his relationship with the police detective who suspects him is really the best part of this film.  I recommend it highly to anyone who enjoys a good thriller and, yes, a vampire movie without the usual amount of blood, etc.",4,"Well, I thought it was pretty good",1108944000,"02 21, 2005",2005,642,"['Jude', 'Law', 'usual', 'outstanding', 'performance', 'man', 'so', 'much', 'talent', 'just', ""n't"", 'fair', 'also', 'so', 'pleasing', 'eye', 'also', 'found', 'supporting', 'actors', 'quite', 'compelling', 'film', 'sort', 'emotional', 'vampire', 'man', 'who', 'must', 'feed', 'women', 'who', 'love', 'seem', 'should', 'have', 'had', 'couple', 'extra', 'women', 'though', 'case', 'problem', 'one', 'rate', 'relationship', 'police', 'detective', 'who', 'really', 'best', 'part', 'film', 'recommend', 'highly', 'anyone', 'who', 'good', 'thriller', 'yes', 'vampire', 'movie', 'usual', 'amount', 'blood', 'etc']",N/A
570971,A1BKMU7Z6D856N,B000056VOS,anna,"[3, 3]","This is not a typical vampire movie, and people expecting a toothily-grinning, blood-spattered thriller will be sorely disappointed. 'Immortality' is an artsy, ponderous, and deliberately paced psychological drama. Yes Steven, the main character, is a vampire, but he doesn't get much of a kick out of it. More than anything, it is a complication in his otherwise normal (he goes out in the daytime, has no trouble with crosses, can eat food) life. There is not much bloodshed, and no usual vampire lore. One of the better things about this movie is its unique perspective on the hows and whys of Steven's vampirism--he was not created, he is not supernatural, he is merely an evolutionary fluke.It is not a perfect film. The cinematography and set design is gorgeous, but at times it feels as if the art direction might strangle the story. For the more action-oriented viewer it may be too slow and ponderous. But if you can get past those things, there's a pretty nice payoff. The plot and script are not quite brilliant, but it's an interesting premise, and there are some clever lines and exchanges.What really carries the movie is the actors, Jude Law in particular. Elina Lowensohn is beautiful and charismatic and has good chemistry with Law, and I think the only reason her performance doesn't stand out as much is more to do with the writing of her character than her ability as an actress. Timothy Spall plays the policeman on Steven's trail, and he and Law play off each other well. But the show really belongs to Jude. He is a strong and accomplished performer, able to convey the often very subtle but strong emotions flickering behind Steven's cool surface. That he is one of the most beautiful men to ever grace the screen certainly doesn't hurt either. He is a magnetic film presence, all around.The biggest problem is a vague one, that hard-to-pinpoint feel of a film that could somehow have been better than it is. Well, that and the gang of hoodlums who hassle Steven at one point, who I found too comical to take seriously, but they're quite a minor point. As a deep, meditative parable of a film (which is what it seems to want to be) it falls short in spots, yet it is too moody and philosophical to be considered a lark-ish bit of entertainment. It hovers somewhere between, often leaning towards the former. What it really comes down to is that people who like this sort of thing will probably like it, and people who don't won't, simple as that. Perhaps one needs to be in the right mood for it; but if it sounds at all interesting to you, I will say that it's definitely worth a look.",4,fangs for the thinker,988156800,"04 25, 2001",2001,2610,"['not', 'typical', 'vampire', 'movie', 'people', 'expecting', 'toothily-grinning', 'blood-spattered', 'thriller', 'will', 'be', 'sorely', 'disappointed', ""'Immortality"", 'artsy', 'ponderous', 'deliberately', 'paced', 'psychological', 'drama', 'Yes', 'Steven', 'main', 'character', 'vampire', ""n't"", 'get', 'much', 'kick', 'More', 'anything', 'complication', 'otherwise', 'normal', 'out', 'daytime', 'trouble', 'crosses', 'can', 'eat', 'food', 'life', 'not', 'much', 'bloodshed', 'usual', 'vampire', 'lore', 'One', 'better', 'things', 'movie', 'unique', 'perspective', 'hows', 'whys', 'Steven', 'vampirism', 'was', 'not', 'created', 'not', 'supernatural', 'merely', 'evolutionary', 'fluke.It', 'not', 'perfect', 'film', 'cinematography', 'set', 'design', 'gorgeous', 'times', 'art', 'direction', 'might', 'strangle', 'story', 'more', 'action-oriented', 'viewer', 'may', 'be', 'too', 'slow', 'ponderous', 'can', 'get', 'things', 'pretty', 'nice', 'payoff', 'plot', 'script', 'are', 'not', 'quite', 'brilliant', 'interesting', 'premise', 'are', 'clever', 'lines', 'really', 'movie', 'actors', 'Jude', 'Law', 'particular', 'Elina', 'Lowensohn', 'beautiful', 'charismatic', 'good', 'chemistry', 'Law', 'think', 'only', 'reason', 'performance', ""n't"", 'stand', 'out', 'as', 'much', 'more', 'do', 'writing', 'character', 'ability', 'actress', 'Timothy', 'Spall', 'policeman', 'Steven', 'trail', 'Law', 'play', 'off', 'other', 'well', 'show', 'really', 'Jude', 'strong', 'accomplished', 'performer', 'able', 'convey', 'often', 'very', 'subtle', 'strong', 'emotions', 'flickering', 'Steven', 'cool', 'surface', 'one', 'most', 'beautiful', 'men', 'ever', 'grace', 'screen', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'either', 'magnetic', 'film', 'presence', 'around.The', 'biggest', 'problem', 'vague', 'one', 'hard-to-pinpoint', 'feel', 'film', 'could', 'somehow', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'Well', 'gang', 'hoodlums', 'who', 'hassle', 'Steven', 'one', 'point', 'who', 'found', 'too', 'comical', 'take', 'seriously', ""'re"", 'minor', 'point', 'deep', 'meditative', 'parable', 'film', 'what', 'want', 'be', 'short', 'spots', 'too', 'moody', 'philosophical', 'be', 'considered', 'lark-ish', 'bit', 'entertainment', 'somewhere', 'often', 'leaning', 'former', 'What', 'really', 'down', 'people', 'who', 'sort', 'thing', 'will', 'probably', 'people', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'wo', ""n't"", 'simple', 'Perhaps', 'one', 'be', 'right', 'mood', 'interesting', 'will', 'say', 'definitely', 'worth', 'look']",N/A

The acting is superb, with the story showcasing Mr. Law's ability to convincingly portray his character once again.  Add to this, Ms. Lowensohn's excellent performance and you have 90 minutes of a taut and intelligent suspense thriller.

A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[2, 2]","After watching the arty, ethereal ""Nadja,"" I was on the prowl for any other movies with:a) vampiresb) Elina L&ouml;wensohnc) all of the aboveFortunately, there was a movie that neatly fit the third option: ""Immortality,"" aka ""The The Wisdom of Crocodiles."" This slow-moving, sensual little movie explores a love affair between an elusive bloodsucker and the mortal woman who manages to capture his fancy -- and while it's slow-moving, both Jude Law and L&ouml;wensohn turn out simply brilliant performances.Steven Grlscz (Jude Law) is a vampire -- he woos lonely women, makes them fall passionately in love with him, and then kills them as he drinks their blood. After the body of one of his victims is found, police Inspector Healey (Timothy Spall) begins to suspect that Steven may have murdered her, especially since one of his previous girlfriends died in a bizarre car crash.At the same time, Steven meets a beautiful Anne Levels (Elina L&ouml;wensohn), a quirky, independent woman with a fondness for chopsticks, drawing and obscure sayings. As she falls in love with him, he begins to fall in love with her as well... despite the fact that he needs the the emotions in her blood. Will he be willing to die for her, or will he kill her instead?""Immortality"" has one of the most inscrutable vampires in ages -- you're never sure if he's a tormented lonely slave to his thirst, or whether he's a predator luring in his prey. It's never entirely clear what's going on behind that charming smile, right up to the end. No matter how handsome or nice he is, director Po-Chih Leong doesn't fall into the cliche of the emo-bloodsucker-with-a-heart-of-gold who just needs the Right Woman to redeem him.For that matter, the movie dances around the question of what the vampire is -- is he a true immortal with a need for blood to stay alive (and an immunity to crosses), or does he have a strange disease? We're never really sure, and I do wish screenwriter Paul Hoffman had made it clearer what had happened in Steven's boyhood.Fortunately, Law does a brilliant job as Steven -- he's smooth, enchanting, romantic and sophisticated, but he also has a serial-killerish streak (he keeps a book of information and mementos for each woman he's killed). And while most love-interests are overshadowed by the vampire, L&ouml;wensohn is a presence as powerful as Law's -- she's an exotic, no-nonsense woman with countless quirks and talents. It would be amazing to have her as a friend.The movie is somewhat slow, but Leong makes a rich experience anyway -- a chilly, perpetually cloudy London is the setting, . And he loads down the story with lots of symbolism: ""The Song of Solomon,"" the metal chopstick, the ""emotion"" crystals, and the gold crucifix. Two of the most moving scenes are actually about characters acting in reverse to what Steven does -- in one scene, the inspector is baptised, washing away his sins even as the vampire begins to struggle with his conscience; in another, Anna gives a crude tracheotomy to a wounded man, piercing his throat to save rather than kill him.""Immortality"" is a bit too slow at times, but it's a rich and thought-provoking vampire movie. Those who require kung-fu, sparkles or black leather need not apply -- this one requires a brain.",5,"Difficult, isn't it?

He has no fangs, but this doesn't stop him from biting ladies' necks...or chewing them.Law's vampire feeds on women whom he has first led to fall in love with him.  For his survival, he needs the emotions they carry in their blood.  Not all these emotions, of course, are nourishing, so after each feeding he coughs up a little mineral sliver about the size of a bobby pin, which he labels and lovingly files away with his other records of his love.  He picks up Lowensohn (who played a vampire herself in the interminably boring movie &quot;Nadja&quot;), with whom he appears to fall in love.  Or does he?  This remains ambiguous.  Like Lowensohn's character, we can't know for sure.There is surprisingly little gruesome violence in this one, though. A couple of scenes are uncomfortably gory, and one of them is entirely gratuitous.  For some reason, filmmakers chose to keep a scene in which Elena Lowensohn's character performs a tracheotomy on a construction worker.  It's a nasty, bloody scene that is meant to show us...what, her resourcefulness?  If so, it is a character trait that is pointedly developed, but to no further end.Still, there is a certain, interesting tension maintained throughout.

570979,A1IWWRZJOXOSYP,B000056VOS,Lee Armstrong,"[12, 14]","""Immortality,"" as the DVD is titled, or ""The Wisdom of Crocodiles,"" as the original theatrical release was titled, is an interesting and partially successful film.  Whether you're Whoopi Goldberg in ""Homer & Eddie"" or Jude Law in this film, it is simply an almost impossible task to have your main character as a serial killer.  We don't like them.  Even when they're as funny as Whoopi or as good looking & talented as Jude, it's an almost impossible task.Po-Chih Leong who is British and has directed in England & Hong Kong and recently directed Steven Segal in ""Out of Reach"" makes an unusually good stab [pun intended] at pulling this off.  It is handsomely photographed.  The scenes that start the film with the car in the tree capture our imagination, even if we're not exactly sure how the car got there.  It's one of those little mysteries that the film doesn't answer.The cast of the film is excellent.  As Stephen Grlscz who has the distinction of not having a vowel in his name, Jude Law makes him seem as sympathetic as possible.  He seesaws back & forth between falling in love with Anne or not.  Law's 2 Oscar nominations for ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" in 1999 & ""Cold Mountain"" in 2003 show him to be a bona fide star actor.  A role like Stephen Grlscz shows the breadth of roles that Law is able to play convincingly.  We're not quite sure if he's a vampire or simply suffers from some strange blood disease.  However, he does not shrivel with daylight nor seem to require a stake through the heart.  His first kill on screen is chilling as it starts as a heated sexual encounter and ends with blood spattered on plastic sheets.  When we see the wall with what is a long series of portraits of others he has similarly killed, we realize he has a long history.  The film doesn't answer questions like how often he needs to kill to maintain himself, why blood from someone that loved him is more potent than the blood of a stranger, or how much blood he needs since he treats his first screen victim Maria like a 7-11 slurpee rather than a good-to-the-last drop Taster's Choice cup of brew.  In short, it's best not to think too much if you want to enjoy this one.New Zealand native Kerry Fox plays the first victim Maria Vaughn who's about to step off the tube stop in front of a train.  Grlscz saves her, only to woo her & then bloodsuck her.  Fox starred in ""Shallow Grave"" with Ewan McGregor.  In ""Intimacy"" in 2001, she played the screen wife of Timothy Spall who plays Inspector Healy that investigates her death in this film.  (She cheated on him in that movie; so maybe that's why he doesn't solve her crime in this one. -- I AM JOKING!)  Her brief time on the screen shows her to be a superlative victim.Romanian actress Elina Lowensohn who is prone to playing vampires here plays the escapee.  Her thick accent sounded French Canadian to me.  While she does a good job as the brainy engineer who can administer first aid to a gory industrial accident victim, I never really felt the chemical sparks fly between her & Law.  It was a chilly romance.One of the highlights of the film is the dowdy little detective Inspector Healy played by Timothy Spall.  He played the effeminate opera star in ""Topsy Turvy"" and as the mousy little Peter Pettigrew in ""Harry Potter & the Prisoner of Azkaban.""  Here he turns in a deep & nuanced performance.  In one scene Grlscz saves Healy from a severe beating or even death from a subway gang and in another explains the nature of evil and good in everyone.  There actually seemed to be more of a connection between Law & Spall than with Lowensohn.  It might have been an interesting twist if Law decided Spall was good enough for an appetizer.The film does churn toward its Hitchcock-like climax at a steady pace.  It's an interesting evening's entertainment, but will not find a place on our shelf at home.

The premise is simple, this vampire feeds on blood as you'd expect but as he does he also sucks down the emotions of his victims, this has caused him to only seek those who are in love with him. From what we know he's had partial success with sucking the blood of women that love him but not complete, he is slowly getting sicker but able to prolong his life so far. He's developed the theory that finding a woman that loves him &#34;purely&#34; he'll be cured of this affliction. He is clearly a vampire because he's able to project his shadow self towards his first victim, no amount of accident in nature would accomplish this feat! He finally meets a girl that's some sort of engineer taking photos of various locations to learn and he lures her in to get her in bed and win her love. He does it successfully, however all is not what it seems as we've learned he may appear normal but his emotions are changed. Being a vampire and forced to live this way he's become good at mimicking who the victims will like, almost all the women love him! He seems uncertain who he is however because we see very little time spent on personal things except drawing and taking notes. I'm sure the book is clearer but it's implied by the identify issues he has that he's very old and has been living this way a long time, almost so that it's all he knows. It could provide a slight backstory as well, maybe he fell in love once early in his life and ended up sucking her blood only to find it prolonged his life more than normal.I can't fault this film it's ok, certainly the book is going to be good once I get it! My final thoughts on the vampire here are he wanted to live but he loved her to much to suck her blood dry. She loved him enough to stick around till he was going berserk then said I'm outta here. For those wishing a happy ending imagine this........ he dies but then re-awakens hours later to find himself alive and healed, he rushes over to tell her and she can hardly believe it MY END",4,Pretty excellent,1402876800,"06 16, 2014",2014,2096,"['just', 'saw', 'Netflix', 'now', 'also', 'know', 'book', 'Paul', 'Hoffman', 'called', 'Wisdom', 'Crocodiles', 'premise', 'simple', 'vampire', 'blood', ""'d"", 'expect', 'also', 'down', 'emotions', 'victims', 'caused', 'only', 'seek', 'who', 'are', 'love', 'what', 'know', 'had', 'partial', 'success', 'sucking', 'blood', 'women', 'love', 'not', 'complete', 'slowly', 'getting', 'sicker', 'able', 'prolong', 'life', 'so', 'far', 'developed', 'theory', 'finding', 'woman', '34', 'purely', '34', ""'ll"", 'be', 'cured', 'affliction', 'clearly', 'vampire', 'able', 'project', 'shadow', 'self', 'first', 'victim', 'amount', 'accident', 'nature', 'would', 'accomplish', 'feat', 'finally', 'girl', 'sort', 'engineer', 'taking', 'photos', 'various', 'locations', 'learn', 'get', 'bed', 'win', 'love', 'successfully', 'however', 'not', 'what', ""'ve"", 'learned', 'may', 'appear', 'normal', 'emotions', 'are', 'changed', 'Being', 'vampire', 'forced', 'live', 'way', 'become', 'good', 'mimicking', 'who', 'victims', 'will', 'like', 'almost', 'women', 'love', 'uncertain', 'who', 'however', 'see', 'very', 'little', 'time', 'spent', 'personal', 'things', 'drawing', 'taking', 'notes', ""'m"", 'sure', 'book', 'clearer', 'implied', 'identify', 'issues', 'very', 'old', 'been', 'living', 'way', 'long', 'time', 'almost', 'could', 'provide', 'slight', 'backstory', 'as', 'well', 'maybe', 'fell', 'love', 'once', 'early', 'life', 'ended', 'up', 'sucking', 'blood', 'only', 'find', 'prolonged', 'life', 'more', 'normal.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'fault', 'film', 'ok', 'certainly', 'book', 'going', 'be', 'good', 'once', 'get', 'My', 'final', 'thoughts', 'vampire', 'here', 'are', 'wanted', 'live', 'loved', 'much', 'suck', 'blood', 'dry', 'loved', 'enough', 'stick', 'around', 'till', 'was', 'going', 'berserk', 'then', 'said', ""'m"", 'outta', 'here', 'wishing', 'happy', 'ending', 'imagine', 'then', 're-awakens', 'hours', 'later', 'find', 'alive', 'healed', 'tell', 'can', 'hardly', 'believe', 'MY', 'END']",N/A

It's a horror movie but only in the smallest of ways.  It's a suspense/drama/action movie without enough of any aspect to satisfy the fan of any of the 3 genres.  Sometimes it seems like a chick flick version of a vampire movie but then again it's not.So what is this movie? It's an exception to the normal run of the mill movie of any genre. It's a combination of all genres without too much of any.  It's a movie in the classic style in the sense that plot, acting, dialogue and directing are paramount instead of CGI or constant action. The series of dialogues between the ""vampire"" and the police sergeant are captivating to those with a philosophical bent. Yet, these dialogues aren't over done so don't be scared away from the movie.Best of all, the movie doesn't cop out.  For some, this will provide an unsatisfactory ending to the movie. But for many, the ending will be quite satisfactory as the director/producer did not stoop to using one of the stereotypical cliche Hollywood endings.

He has enormous range and I've never been let down by his performance, and this movie didn't change my opinion.I also think Elina L&ouml;wensohn is delightful.  She's cute, but not in a conventional way, and that makes her interesting.Still, good talent couldn't save this movie.  ""Immortality"" is basically a vampire story without any of the trappings of your typical vampire tale.  Jude Law, the vampire, is not afraid of the sun.  He has a reflection.  On the surface, he's just an eccentric guy living in London and seducing women.Elina L&ouml;wensohn is a tough engineer, and in her Law meets his match.  The plot of the movie focuses on their love affair and the tension that builds as you wonder if she'll survive.  A secondary plot revolves around a police detective who's discovered on of Law's victims and has become suspicious of him.The problem is that the two plotlines don't really tie together, and that seems to be a theme for the entire movie.  The film can't decide what it wants to be.  Sometimes it seems like an erotic thriller, similar to ""The Hunger.""  At other times it's trying to be a tragic romance.  There's even a bit of philosophy and action thrown into the mix.

Especially in a scene with an innocuous looking Jude Law walking with a police constable, tossing around semi-baked ideas of the blurry lines that divides Good vs. Evil in the hearts of men. The soundtrack supports the superb screenplay immaculately.Problem is, apart from dragging for the last half an hour, the movie ultimately leaves a taste of pointlessness. The entire narrative hinges on whether or not Law is a vampire, simply because we need to know why he acts the way he does. In the absence of that, it is merely a slow-paced tale of poof.

I haven't seen anything like this since my company stopped supplying me with rental cars. (Rental cars are magic. They can do anything.) We soon find out that Steven Grlscz [sic] is a vampire who courts women then kills them. He can taste emotion in their blood and keeps a log book. The film takes place in the non-metric part of England that measures speed in miles per hour instead of kilometers per hour.Steven becomes intrigued by Annie Labels (Elina L&ouml;wensohn), an engineer with a French accent and B positive blood. About the same time the police (Timothy Spall who would later become a rodent in those Potter films) also becomes interested in Steven who has lost two girlfriends in the last few months.The film was also released under a different title, ""The Wisdom of Crocodiles."" It is an interesting and different vampire film. The character of Steven was intentionally dead pan for much of the movie which weighed the film down in a number of scenes.I would of liked to have seen Steven's character more developed through dead girlfriends instead of just the one we get to see.

It is very hard to dislike Jude Law in any film I see. He has so much depth to his acting ability. You found yourself almost feeling sad for him because he seemed to care for the women he killed, but,in order to live he had to have their blood which carried specific emotions his body needed in order to survive. This is not a typical vampire movie although that is exactly what he appears to be in this film...perhaps a modern day vampire does not have a problem with sunlight or needs the blood for the same reasons as your usual run-of-the-mill vampire if there was one. Although this is not a great picture it did hold my attention and I did begin to care about Steve (Jude Law's character). You couldn't help but begin to care about him even though what he did was absolutely awful. The end will suprise you I think. It did me. Some of the women he chose, however, just did not seem to be good matches for him. NOne of them were played by anyone I had heard of nor were they glamorous at all...they all seemed to be rather troubled. which is interesting why he was drawn to them. Nonetheless, if you are a Jude Law fan then this movie may be a disappointment but it won't be a waste. He is very good in this film. It is just the film isn't exactly ... very good.

It is defitely not 'vampire' movie but rather an attempt to some phylosophical sharade about love and life (at least, that's how I understood it).

570993,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B000056VOS,Z Hayes,"[4, 4]","Having enjoyed the recent coming-of-age vampire tale ""Let the Right One In"", I was on the hunt for other unique vampire tales, and came across this older movie starring Jude Law. I'm no great fan of the actor, but I thought he did a decent turn in this. ""Immortality"" [with the alternate title of ""Wisdom of Crocodiles""] is an unusual vampire tale - Jude Law plays medical consultant Steven Grlscz[a unique and unpronounceable last name] who has a predilection for making young women fall madly in love with him. But this is no ordinary Casanova - Steven has a rare blood disorder in which he has to feed off another human's blood in order to survive and not let his body break down. Trouble is, getting plasma from the local blood bank isn't going to cut it - Steven needs to feed off the 'love' in the victim's blood.So basically he's a serial killer with a rather unusual modus operandi - until he meets comely, feisty and intelligent structural engineer Anna Labels[Elina Lowensohn] whose sex appeal is matched by her intellectual brilliance. Both are drawn to each other intellectually and sexually, a meeting of hearts and minds if you will. This places Steve in a conundrum - what does he do to survive? Will Anna be another sacrificial victim?The movie plays out very well - it unfolds leisurely but I never felt this was tedious or plodding. Besides the interaction between Steven and Anna, the other relationship that made this movie interesting was the dynamics between Steven and the police inspector Sgt. Healey [Timothy Spall] investigating him as a murder suspect in a young woman's death. Both Steven and Healey develop a father-son like relationship over the course of the movie and watching the evolution of their relationship is a highlight of this film.The gore factor is surprisingly minimal in this movie, and even the brutal scenes are artfully done. It plays out beautifully, and the sets are well-done, especially Steven's apartment with its hidden room.I'd recommend this to those who love a unique vampire tale with first-rate acting.",5,A unique vampire tale,1242691200,"05 19, 2009",2009,2061,"['Having', 'enjoyed', 'recent', 'coming-of-age', 'vampire', 'tale', 'Let', 'Right', 'One', 'was', 'hunt', 'other', 'unique', 'vampire', 'tales', 'came', 'older', 'movie', 'starring', 'Jude', 'Law', ""'m"", 'great', 'fan', 'actor', 'thought', 'did', 'decent', 'turn', 'Immortality', '[', 'alternate', 'title', 'Wisdom', 'Crocodiles', ']', 'unusual', 'vampire', 'tale', 'Jude', 'Law', 'medical', 'consultant', 'Steven', 'Grlscz', 'unique', 'unpronounceable', 'last', 'name', ']', 'who', 'predilection', 'making', 'young', 'women', 'fall', 'madly', 'love', 'ordinary', 'Casanova', 'Steven', 'rare', 'blood', 'disorder', 'feed', 'off', 'human', 'blood', 'order', 'survive', 'not', 'let', 'body', 'break', 'down', 'Trouble', 'getting', 'plasma', 'local', 'blood', 'bank', ""n't"", 'going', 'cut', 'Steven', 'feed', 'off', ""'love"", 'victim', 'blood.So', 'basically', 'serial', 'killer', 'rather', 'unusual', 'modus', 'operandi', 'comely', 'feisty', 'intelligent', 'structural', 'engineer', 'Anna', 'Labels', '[', 'Elina', 'Lowensohn', ']', 'sex', 'appeal', 'matched', 'intellectual', 'brilliance', 'are', 'drawn', 'other', 'intellectually', 'sexually', 'meeting', 'hearts', 'minds', 'will', 'Steve', 'conundrum', 'what', 'do', 'survive', 'Will', 'Anna', 'be', 'sacrificial', 'victim', 'movie', 'out', 'very', 'well', 'leisurely', 'never', 'felt', 'was', 'tedious', 'plodding', 'interaction', 'Steven', 'Anna', 'other', 'relationship', 'made', 'movie', 'interesting', 'was', 'dynamics', 'Steven', 'police', 'inspector', 'Sgt', 'Healey', '[', 'Timothy', 'Spall', ']', 'investigating', 'murder', 'suspect', 'young', 'woman', 'death', 'Steven', 'Healey', 'develop', 'father-son', 'relationship', 'course', 'movie', 'watching', 'evolution', 'relationship', 'highlight', 'film.The', 'gore', 'factor', 'surprisingly', 'minimal', 'movie', 'even', 'brutal', 'scenes', 'are', 'artfully', 'done', 'out', 'beautifully', 'sets', 'are', 'well-done', 'especially', 'Steven', 'apartment', 'hidden', 'room.I', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'who', 'love', 'unique', 'vampire', 'tale', 'first-rate', 'acting']",N/A
