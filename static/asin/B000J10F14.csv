1023934,A1ALOIPRR8Q06J,B000J10F14,"2 cents ""meaningless memes""","[1, 2]","Well done. The definitive documentary film of Hurricane Katrina and New Orleans. Spike Lee has arguably crafted his finest film here. He did the people of New Orleans a great service. When the Levees Broke isn't easy to watch due of course to the subject matter, but when a story is told so well you take it in and deal with it better than when you're just bombarded with clips on idiotic network news. With an excellent documentary like this the story is made into a human drama you are compelled to watch. The events are fleshed out and the viewer can achieve a deeper, richer understanding of things. I love a good documentary and I'd put this in my top 10 (which is saying a lot).",5,history served,1273017600,"05 5, 2010",2010,684,"['Well', 'done', 'definitive', 'documentary', 'film', 'Hurricane', 'Katrina', 'New', 'Orleans', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'arguably', 'crafted', 'finest', 'film', 'here', 'did', 'people', 'New', 'Orleans', 'great', 'service', 'When', 'Levees', 'Broke', ""n't"", 'easy', 'watch', 'due', 'course', 'subject', 'matter', 'when', 'story', 'told', 'so', 'well', 'take', 'deal', 'better', 'when', ""'re"", 'just', 'bombarded', 'clips', 'idiotic', 'network', 'news', 'excellent', 'documentary', 'story', 'made', 'human', 'drama', 'are', 'compelled', 'watch', 'events', 'are', 'fleshed', 'viewer', 'can', 'achieve', 'deeper', 'richer', 'understanding', 'things', 'love', 'good', 'documentary', ""'d"", 'put', 'top', '10', 'saying', 'lot']",When the Levees Broke: A Requiem In Four Acts

1023936,AO31JF8HT1ONU,B000J10F14,"Adam J. Fernandes ""DarkWriter""","[22, 26]","I've heard this criticism of Spike before this and I have never understood where it has come from. I guess if you spend your life and career documenting lives and creating stories about people that society has left behind, and if a large portion of those depicted have been black, I guess you get called a ""racist!"" Spike does see racism everywhere but let me ask you this: what black man of his age, who grew up where he grew up, doesn't have some of those tinges simply from being burned by the system? Every writer pours some of himself into everything he does, fictional or not.I watched Hurricane Katrina and the various reports on CNN and other news outlets with a dull horror thinking about a National Geographic doc I had seen in 97 or 98 about hurricanes and tornados. They predicted, especially a through a chilling and prophetic artist's conception, exactly what happened in New Orleans in 05. An weather offical (I can't remember his offical post) said the levee's were a ""two edged sword."" If the water ever went over them, the water would get as deep as the levee's are tall. That's exactly what happened. As Spike points out in his excellent commentary that's like, as the best commentaries are, having a second movie included, that's what caused the destruction. Hurricane Katrina side-swiped New Orleans.Through stunning interviews with most of the prinicipals involved with this tragedy, from Mayor Nagin and Governor Blanco to Shelton ""Shakespeare"" Alexander and Wynton Marsalis, he cuts to the main human tragedy at the heart of the story. There are more black people in this doc than white people but hey, that's the majority of the people that got screwed by their government, from all sources except for the Coast Guard. There's enough historical information to answer questions and it's long enough (FOUR HOURS!) to give enough time to everybody to say their peace.My favorite moments include Soledad O'Brien's ""interorgation"" of Michael Brown that shows what happens when reporters have the guts to ask tough questions and see through the lies and the avoidance that politicians always do when their backed into a corner by the truth. The analysis of the levee's and the warnings that were basically ignored by President Bush the day before the storm.Spike's commentary is funny as well as insightful to his filmaking process. He proved to me that he wasn't racist when he says things like, ""George Bush doesn't care about poor white people either."" over footage of two white women talking in front of one of there torn down houses. He praises the two white guys who told Dick Cheney to go **** himself in Misissippi as well as the white lady who told Condie Rice ""How dare you!"" while she was shopping for shoes the day after the storm.This documentary does what all good documentaries do. They answer questions while raising more while at the same time raising your awareness above and beyond where it was before.Bravo Spike!!By the way, the single largest death toll from a hurricane was in Galveston, Texas in 1900. The death toll from that was over 6,000 from a total population in the town from a little over 37,000! That is the greatest natural disaster in US history.

1023937,A3BOGELRQJK8OE,B000J10F14,a gentle sound,"[2, 3]","So many things stand out in this effort and so much can be said.First, I agree completely with a short moment in the film that talks about mirrors, how we might not like the feeling looking into one. Be jarred by the reality we then might have to face. I know that feeling in my life, it's utterly difficult. Then it goes on to compare this event in Katrina to that, and the subsequent news images, reports to the public dealing with that kind of look in a mirror. But this was also stating it's the look into the mirror just held up to us on and on, as we are locked in the feeling of long term utter dismay at what is really there to be understood. And this film has captured it, and that small observation re-states what this movie does. It holds the mirror to our national behavior in Katrina, to our compassion nationally, our corruption and values, to our reactions and reasons, in this time we call our greatest national disaster, Katrina.So first, a thank you to those willing to allow invasion into their pain. And to the makers. It's not easy to bear that heat. And it is awesome personal narratives told the story.Likewise I'd really have vastly preferred to see this in the theater.Large and inescapable, because of its intensity, I ran out numerous times unable to bear a lot of it. The scenes and the pain for the people are so overwhelmingly playing out- it's difficult to re-live it with them. To look in this film to see what being poor and black sitting on prime real estate in America today gets you by way of disaster response, it just stills my thinking down to utter horror. It's beyond me to try to qualify this national memorial, requiem, impossible to square it with any glimmer of fairness that was buried by this Bush backed leadership. In a time of pain here, today, clearly the predominant issue in American compassion is not determined by anyone's suffering. No, it isn't. Watch.So within this documentary you look at personal experiences, learn about the aftermath, re-visit obviously good folk dealing with harsh tragedy, see the governmental agencies in play in Katrina, get to even hear a cleaned up Barbara Bush extolling the virtues of shelter life for underpriviledged blacks who are in apparently, in her view, better positions and loving it. ( I'll never ever forget what I saw then as she blithely said to her TV audience that the dispaced in Texas shelters were really liking hotel life as, after all, it was just a good time compared to their real lives. If ever, ever I wanted the defining statement of the attitude I find pernicious beyond belief that would be the you tuby film clip of it) You get to see the experience through time, even hear about weather patterns, the levy's- the works. It's so compelling you listen and watch masterful editing taking you down a river of meaning to arrive at a place where ultimately you are left with the thing New Orleans always embodied anyway, the sheer spirit of a people to endure and find their human dignity, their essence just there.The art of this documentary is that somehow Lee finds what makes New Orleans something we treasure that is seen, no held,reflected to us,  in her arts, it's the soul I think of that waiting for a day of justice, of freedom, of fairness. Asking the question if we are going to face up to and live our creeds. The artist's role is asking. It is just there in that guy in the film playing the trumpet walking past the piles of collected filth.....playing with the mastery of the artist asking, How could this happen? And what does this say of our greatness, and where exactly does our greatness find expression?I think the film poses the question to this generation, to my generation.I don't think any art work poses it better. In it at least for me Mr. Lee cemented his place in a narrow group that I have held up in my consciousness of those willing to hold a mirror to a national audience. I don't think until we deal with what Katrina raised we have any imperative to govern. We may do it, but we don't seem to me to have any clarity about what we do it for. Because we lost ""we the people"" somehow and I don't see anyone noticing really that in the national bus we aren't even putting a segment of our people in the back seats. We are leaving them out on the road and kicking dust in their face. But that's me and it shouldn't get in the way of watching. There is so much to be taken here in personal ways, so much to motivate and understand. It will stand alone for me as a piece. I could write in twenty minutes and say something entirely different as some moment and question raised flashed into memory. It's deep this work. Worth the time.I'd watch and give this to family, teachers, teens, as graduation present, to groups that want to do work on issues of our times.

As the ball dropped in Times Square (a few subway stops from my apt) I was sitting at my computer watching this riviting documentary. Again. Katrina and the near destruction of New Orleans was, for me, the most personal tragedy. I know what you're thinking: but she lives in NYC. Wasn't 9/11 the most heartbreaking? No. Because I knew in 1981 when I first went into the WTC lobby this was going to happen. I just didn't know when. Over the yrs. I told all my friends to avoid working there like the plague. I did not lose one single friend that dreadful morning. Spike Lee created a visual memory for future generations to see what hate looks like. Discrimination. The haves versus the have nots and never will haves. I lived in New Orleans in the late 80s in the French Quarter. Knew then this would happen so I cherished every moment I was there. Being an Intuitive, few things are a surprise in my life. Many places I frequented then do not exist. More than a thousand people I passed on the streets do not exist now. The haunting music from 'Inside Man' is a perfect compliment to the scenes of utter destruction and misery. God bless Sean Penn. Why can't there be more like him who can but don't help? This should be shown in every school in the US by the 5th Grade. We cannot afford to have people forget Katrina as the years pass by. The interviews are extensive and unforgetable.

He gets out of the way and lets people's words and pictures tell the story and does away with any voiceover narration. The DVD set is divided into four acts with a fifth bonus act updating the various survivors' lives.The basic style is backlit portrait framing of the person speaking and just letting them go. This succeeds because of fantastic editing in piecing together all these disparate people's stories.It's also great that Lee uses outside news coverage (mainly the BBC's) as well as local and CNN's clips. It gives a far better perspective on how the media covered the story. The images though will be burned into your skull especially of dead bodies just lying (or floating) on streets, freeway interchanges or just sitting in chairs next to the Superdome.One of the acts mainly focuses on the levees themselves and what wasn't done in years past and what should be done to prevent them breaking again. Hearing engineers talk about the levees and the mistakes the Corps of Engineers made over 40 years (since the previous hurrcane, Betsy, hit NOLA in '65) and how the Netherlands gets it right should put America to shame.The ""Water is Rising"" on the bonus DVD is just still pics set to a jazz soundtrack but is definitely worth viewing as they have just as strong an impact.This DVD set should be required viewing by every single citizen of the USA so that everything is done to help rebuild one of the most vibrant cities in their nation.",5,Spike Lee hits on all cylinders,1322524800,"11 29, 2011",2011,1481,"['Spike', 'Lee', 'genius', 'period', 'way', 'people', 'words', 'pictures', 'tell', 'story', 'away', 'voiceover', 'narration', 'DVD', 'set', 'divided', 'four', 'acts', 'fifth', 'bonus', 'act', 'updating', 'various', 'survivors', 'lives.The', 'basic', 'style', 'backlit', 'portrait', 'framing', 'person', 'speaking', 'just', 'letting', 'go', 'fantastic', 'editing', 'piecing', 'together', 'disparate', 'people', 'stories.It', 'also', 'great', 'Lee', 'outside', 'news', 'coverage', 'mainly', 'BBC', 'as', 'well', 'local', 'CNN', 'clips', 'far', 'better', 'perspective', 'how', 'media', 'covered', 'story', 'images', 'will', 'be', 'burned', 'skull', 'especially', 'dead', 'bodies', 'just', 'lying', 'floating', 'streets', 'freeway', 'interchanges', 'just', 'sitting', 'chairs', 'Superdome.One', 'acts', 'mainly', 'levees', 'what', 'was', ""n't"", 'done', 'years', 'past', 'what', 'should', 'be', 'done', 'prevent', 'breaking', 'again', 'Hearing', 'engineers', 'talk', 'levees', 'mistakes', 'Corps', 'Engineers', 'made', '40', 'years', 'previous', 'hurrcane', 'Betsy', 'hit', 'NOLA', ""'65"", 'how', 'Netherlands', 'right', 'should', 'put', 'America', 'shame.The', 'Water', 'Rising', 'bonus', 'DVD', 'just', 'still', 'pics', 'set', 'jazz', 'soundtrack', 'definitely', 'worth', 'viewing', 'have', 'just', 'strong', 'impact.This', 'DVD', 'set', 'should', 'be', 'required', 'viewing', 'single', 'citizen', 'USA', 'everything', 'done', 'help', 'rebuild', 'one', 'most', 'vibrant', 'cities', 'nation']",When the Levees Broke: A Requiem In Four Acts

Pfleeger,"[7, 9]","Let me start this by saying that I am a Katrina survivor.I spent several weeks away from home and would never consider myself a refugee as the media and government would probably labeled me. My home was and is two miles or so from the 17th Street Canal breach.Spike Lee and Sam Pollard have crafted the finest type of documentary. The story is an oral history by the people involved with very little interjection of opinion by the filmakers. Lee manages to let the people tell their own stories, to voice their views, to laugh, cry and heal. A rather large segment of the New Orleans population is included. Lee's opinion that this was not just a race tragedy but one of class also is well presented.We get an overall dim view of the state, local, and national government in the days immediately preceding and following the passage of the hurricane. The key point is that suffering and death that resulted was not caused by Katrina but by the human error that was the building of the levee system that was designed to protect the city and its surroundings. Another strong point that Lee makes was the sense of abandonment that the citizens of the area felt in the days following the storm. How is it conceivable in America that it would take the government five days to get to the site.The series is presented on three discs with the four hour feature occupying the first two discs. Lee provides a very insightful commentary on the feature which is easily equal to the material presented. He gives his thoughts on the disaster and provides information on the creation of the film (how it came together).The bonus materials are also quite relevant. An epilogue entitled Next Movement runs about 105 minutes and provides more interviews on the rebuilding process. Water is Rising is a photo montage with the music of Terance Blanchard. Both of these features are well worth seeing.Lee says that he would like to continue to follow this story into the future as Michael Apted did on his UP Series.

Here he documents, over four acts, the Hurricane Katrina debacle through the eyes of one very ticked off black man. The first two acts basically retell the story of the lead up to the hurricane and its path of destruction. Act III, the weakest of the bunch, kind of blathers on about how great the music of New Orleans is and how terrible the devastation is. The final act is something of an enjoyable diversion as Lee seems to go after any pet peeve of his that he can connect to Katrina: insurance companies, global warming, government corruption. The thing that amazed me is how it really was no different than those color by numbers, dry as dust ones that PBS puts out on a weekly basis, and yet this one, powered by anger, outrage and audacity never slows down and schools the viewer on all aspects of the travesty. This is something of an amazing feat and the only thing that prevents it from being a great film is that it is a tad overstuffed.Whether you are conspiracy minded or not (I am as is this film) there is plenty here to shock even the most casual viewer, and that itself seems to be the main point. Even if you weren't directly affected by Katrina any person with a brain can recognize this as a prime example of the US government crapping all over their citizens in the name of callousness and greed. Lee goes so far as to imply that the levees were bombed in an attempt to chase the black people out of the 9th Ward so that the white developers could move in and make barrels of gold off of other people's land. It all made sense to me and if you don't see it then I might suggest that perhaps you watch too much Fox News. And let us not forget the clips of the armed troops keeping the displaced blacks out of the white neighborhoods at gunpoint. Or the cops looting the Wal-Mart for DVDs. Or George W. Bush, waste of blood that he is, grandstanding on the outskirts of the city politicking for his Imperial Grand Strategy. Funny how every time a national disaster happens on this man's watch the person that benefits the most is George W. Bush.I will admit that Lee does have an overly strong inclination to go to bat for the home team. Ray Nagin looks outstanding here and yet New Orleans looks like a pit. Can these two things truly exist completely independently of one another? I also could have lived without the slave rhetoric. But I also think that we need to admit that this tragedy exposed racial problems in our country. In no way do I walk around looking for examples of racism, we have come very far since the Civil Rights Movement, but when things like this occur and racism stares us in the face we need to own up to it. I will be very interested to see if Louisiana remains red in the next election. No other state was as directly affected by Republican ineptitude as they were, but will it be enough to bring them over to the blue team? ***3/4",4,"Under Bush we've lost 2 wars, 2 trade towers and the Entire City of New Orleans",1177718400,"04 28, 2007",2007,3035,"['Say', 'what', 'will', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'not', 'buy', 'government', 'spin', 'reason', 'out', 'voice', 'reason', 'nation', 'sheep', 'Here', 'documents', 'four', 'acts', 'Hurricane', 'Katrina', 'debacle', 'eyes', 'one', 'very', 'ticked', 'off', 'black', 'man', 'first', 'two', 'acts', 'basically', 'retell', 'story', 'lead', 'up', 'hurricane', 'path', 'destruction', 'Act', 'III', 'weakest', 'bunch', 'kind', 'blathers', 'how', 'great', 'music', 'New', 'Orleans', 'how', 'terrible', 'devastation', 'final', 'act', 'something', 'enjoyable', 'diversion', 'Lee', 'go', 'pet', 'peeve', 'can', 'connect', 'Katrina', 'insurance', 'companies', 'global', 'warming', 'government', 'corruption', 'thing', 'amazed', 'how', 'really', 'was', 'different', 'color', 'numbers', 'dry', 'dust', 'ones', 'PBS', 'out', 'weekly', 'basis', 'yet', 'one', 'powered', 'anger', 'outrage', 'audacity', 'never', 'down', 'schools', 'viewer', 'aspects', 'travesty', 'something', 'amazing', 'feat', 'only', 'thing', 'being', 'great', 'film', 'tad', 'are', 'conspiracy', 'minded', 'not', 'am', 'as', 'film', 'plenty', 'here', 'shock', 'even', 'most', 'casual', 'viewer', 'be', 'main', 'point', 'Even', 'were', ""n't"", 'directly', 'affected', 'Katrina', 'person', 'brain', 'can', 'recognize', 'prime', 'example', 'US', 'government', 'crapping', 'citizens', 'name', 'callousness', 'greed', 'Lee', 'so', 'far', 'imply', 'levees', 'were', 'bombed', 'attempt', 'chase', 'black', 'people', '9th', 'Ward', 'white', 'developers', 'could', 'move', 'make', 'barrels', 'gold', 'other', 'people', 'land', 'made', 'sense', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'then', 'might', 'suggest', 'perhaps', 'watch', 'too', 'much', 'Fox', 'News', 'let', 'not', 'forget', 'clips', 'armed', 'troops', 'keeping', 'displaced', 'blacks', 'white', 'neighborhoods', 'gunpoint', 'cops', 'looting', 'Wal-Mart', 'DVDs', 'George', 'W.', 'Bush', 'waste', 'blood', 'grandstanding', 'outskirts', 'city', 'politicking', 'Imperial', 'Grand', 'Strategy', 'Funny', 'how', 'time', 'national', 'disaster', 'man', 'watch', 'person', 'benefits', 'most', 'George', 'W.', 'Bush.I', 'will', 'admit', 'Lee', 'have', 'overly', 'strong', 'inclination', 'go', 'bat', 'home', 'team', 'Ray', 'Nagin', 'outstanding', 'here', 'yet', 'New', 'Orleans', 'pit', 'Can', 'two', 'things', 'truly', 'exist', 'completely', 'independently', 'one', 'also', 'could', 'have', 'lived', 'slave', 'rhetoric', 'also', 'think', 'need', 'admit', 'tragedy', 'exposed', 'racial', 'problems', 'country', 'way', 'do', 'walk', 'looking', 'examples', 'racism', 'have', 'come', 'very', 'far', 'Civil', 'Rights', 'Movement', 'when', 'things', 'occur', 'racism', 'stares', 'face', 'need', 'own', 'up', 'will', 'be', 'very', 'interested', 'see', 'Louisiana', 'red', 'next', 'election', 'other', 'state', 'was', 'directly', 'affected', 'Republican', 'ineptitude', 'were', 'will', 'be', 'enough', 'bring', 'blue', 'team', '***3/4']",When the Levees Broke: A Requiem In Four Acts
1023947,A1FDV3WPOHREY9,B000J10F14,"C. Scanlon ""least helpful reviewer""","[6, 8]","This is the production which Spike Lee was born to make, the greatest since he first did School Daze. This is why God made Spike Lee, for us to see this.Despite being denied certain important footage (including the famous phoney air-guitar performance in California by US President George W. Bush while the indigent, elderly and infirm of New Orleans drowned in their homes or died of thirst in the stadium), Spike Lee used all of his great talent, experience, insight, wisdom, intelligence, heart and soul in creating this historic collection of the times of death in New Orleans, the heart and soul of these Americas, the birthplace of our American culture, now washed away forever under the poisoned waters of our great greed, purposeful incompetence and solipsistic self-interest.Everything possible, nevertheless, is included here, plus some. Please watch this with Mr. Lee's comentary turned on. You will find he could only include half of what was worthy and necessary. For instance we see much of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police arriving from Vancouver before our own federales appear, and the BBC, etc., but we do not see the delegation of doctors and other medical personnel from Havana who came only to be turned away for purely political reasons. Yet all that is most important is here, if only as metonymy.Mr. Lee's keen insight and courage come through clearly as he guides us through the horror which we do to New Orleans and our own people. This DVD must be seen in its entirety by every student in America, by every church and synogogue and mosque in America, by every government agency in America, if we are to remember who we are as Americans and our national mission. When I was a small boy I remember watching on television our President and commmander-in-chief command us to ask not what America can do for us but what we can do for America. Now we see America sucked dry in our treasure and life's blood by those who ask only what America can do for them, at the cost of billions of dollars a month, and nothing for our American people. Watch this movie, timid as it may be, and cautious, and remember the New Testamenet commandment to care for widows and orphans in their distress as being the practice of perfect and true religion, to care for the sick, and respect the elderly. To bury the dead is a work of mercy. Watch this movie and wonder where was our government who had publicly taken on the care of our people prior to the hurricane. Wonder with the people here whether the levees were dynamited as early in the twentieth century to save wealthier properties. Mr. Lee also raises the probable cause of Mr. Trump desiring choice land for his new casino without the messy and expensive inconvenience of eminent domain as in Bridgeport condemning people's homes for the sake of a private hotel, etc.This excellent documentary also illustrates why our shock and awe military involvement in Iraq can never possibly produce the alleged results, as the generals have noted. In this documentary we see a brave and noble and courageous and moral general enter New Orleans days after the administration washed its hands of the affair and left the people to die without food, water, and other essentials of life locked inside the stadium, ordered the soldiers to lower their eapons held against our own citizens, and ordered supplies to come in and the people to be moved out. HE gets good things done, and ought to be in charge of establishing a peaceful and functioning society in Bagdhad, as we allegedly desire. To see him order the soldiers reluctantly to disarm themselves is a blessing from Heaven, and a first step in the right direction towards a peaceful society.Watch with attention the examination of the viability of the civil engineering, and the comndemnation of our banking and insurance industries, which mark record profits. Wonder where our society went to. Watch this movie and realize it is real. Then go out and help your neighbor, that destitute person on the street, everyone you meet.

The great disaster which befell the city was not so much natural as man-made.  And throughout the documentary's four hour run time, director Spike Lee not only presents a kalidescope of interviews with survivors, he repeatedly returns to the inevitable question: how did it happen?Much of the answer to that question depends on who you ask.  New Orleans has a history of blowing levees, and early in the film several people state flatly that the levees were deliberately blown in an effort to protect the city's weathier districts at the expense of poorer areas.  But although director Lee gives the idea play, it soon becomes clear that no such effort was required: it was in fact a mixture of bad design; neglect; an unwillingness by city, state, and federal officials to spend the money; and, most simply, indifference toward the people of New Orleans and indeed Louisiana in general.WHEN THE LEVEES BROKE is truly devastating in its portrait of a great American city's collapse.  Interviews with survivors, achieval footage, and news reports paint a damning portrait of failure at almost every possible level.  Most damning is the picture of federal inaction.  While people drowned in their attics, President Bush was on vacation.  While people collapsed from heat prostration and dehydration Condoleeza Rice bought shoes at an upscale store.  The minutes became hours, the hours became days, and the cavalry simply did not arrive.Spike Lee is a somewhat problematic director, an artist who has the very distinct tendency to interject race issues into scenarios whether such is warranted or not.  In this particular instance, however, I believe Lee is on target when the attributes federal inaction in large part to the fact that New Orleans is predominately poor and black.  Had he gone further to note the obvious fact that the city is also of the deep South--a region that has typically been ignored by Washington--he would have struck a bull's eye; it is worth pointing out that south Mississippi, which is predominately white, experienced the same federal foot dragging and ridiculous mismanagement.When all is said and done, WHEN THE LEVEES broke is a stunning but flawed portrait of a horrific disaster that befell a great American city--a city which, as of this date, has yet to begin a significant recovery and which will very likely never again be the New Orleans of legend and song.  It's great strength is that it allows the victims to speak for themselves; it's great failure is a tendency to posit race plain and simple as the cause of federal indifference.  It was a mighty factor, to be sure, but nothing is ever quite as simple as all that.The DVD release includes three disks.  The film itself offers a commentary by Lee; the third disk consists of bonus material that further elaborates what is indeed an American tragedy.  In spite of occasional flaws, I recommend it very strongly.GFT, Amazon Reviewer",5,Slightly Flawed But Stunning Overall,1177632000,"04 27, 2007",2007,3417,"['resident', 'south', 'Mississippi', 'am', 'incredibly', 'frustrated', 'media', 'reports', 'Hurricane', 'Katrina', 'Struck', 'New', 'Orleans', 'truth', 'Hurricane', 'Katrina', 'struck', 'Mississippi', 'gulf', 'coast', 'south', 'Louisiana', 'visiting', 'areas', 'thirty', 'foot', 'wall', 'water', 'New', 'Orleans', 'edge', 'weaker', 'northwest', 'quadrant', 'storm', 'was', 'merely', 'brushed.It', 'point', 'THE', 'LEVEES', 'BROKE', 'out', 'early', 'New', 'Orleans', 'received', 'best', 'glancing', 'blow', 'should', 'have', 'survived', 'great', 'disaster', 'befell', 'city', 'was', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'natural', 'man-made', 'documentary', 'four', 'hour', 'run', 'time', 'director', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'not', 'only', 'kalidescope', 'interviews', 'survivors', 'repeatedly', 'inevitable', 'question', 'how', 'did', 'happen', 'Much', 'answer', 'question', 'who', 'ask', 'New', 'Orleans', 'history', 'blowing', 'levees', 'early', 'film', 'several', 'people', 'state', 'flatly', 'levees', 'were', 'deliberately', 'blown', 'effort', 'protect', 'city', 'weathier', 'districts', 'expense', 'poorer', 'areas', 'director', 'Lee', 'idea', 'play', 'soon', 'clear', 'such', 'effort', 'was', 'required', 'was', 'fact', 'mixture', 'bad', 'design', 'unwillingness', 'city', 'state', 'federal', 'officials', 'spend', 'money', 'most', 'simply', 'indifference', 'people', 'New', 'Orleans', 'indeed', 'Louisiana', 'general.WHEN', 'THE', 'LEVEES', 'BROKE', 'truly', 'devastating', 'portrait', 'great', 'American', 'city', 'collapse', 'Interviews', 'survivors', 'achieval', 'footage', 'news', 'reports', 'paint', 'damning', 'portrait', 'failure', 'almost', 'possible', 'level', 'Most', 'damning', 'picture', 'federal', 'inaction', 'people', 'drowned', 'attics', 'President', 'Bush', 'was', 'vacation', 'people', 'collapsed', 'heat', 'prostration', 'dehydration', 'Condoleeza', 'Rice', 'bought', 'shoes', 'upscale', 'store', 'minutes', 'became', 'hours', 'hours', 'became', 'days', 'cavalry', 'simply', 'did', 'not', 'arrive.Spike', 'Lee', 'somewhat', 'problematic', 'director', 'artist', 'who', 'very', 'distinct', 'tendency', 'interject', 'race', 'issues', 'scenarios', 'such', 'warranted', 'not', 'particular', 'instance', 'however', 'believe', 'Lee', 'target', 'when', 'attributes', 'federal', 'inaction', 'large', 'part', 'fact', 'New', 'Orleans', 'predominately', 'poor', 'black', 'Had', 'gone', 'further', 'note', 'obvious', 'fact', 'city', 'also', 'deep', 'South', 'region', 'typically', 'been', 'ignored', 'Washington', 'would', 'have', 'struck', 'bull', 'eye', 'worth', 'pointing', 'out', 'south', 'Mississippi', 'predominately', 'white', 'experienced', 'same', 'federal', 'foot', 'dragging', 'ridiculous', 'mismanagement.When', 'said', 'done', 'THE', 'LEVEES', 'broke', 'stunning', 'flawed', 'portrait', 'horrific', 'disaster', 'befell', 'great', 'American', 'city', 'city', 'date', 'yet', 'begin', 'significant', 'recovery', 'will', 'very', 'likely', 'never', 'again', 'be', 'New', 'Orleans', 'legend', 'song', 'great', 'strength', 'victims', 'speak', 'great', 'failure', 'tendency', 'posit', 'race', 'plain', 'simple', 'cause', 'federal', 'indifference', 'was', 'mighty', 'factor', 'be', 'sure', 'nothing', 'ever', 'quite', 'as', 'simple', 'that.The', 'DVD', 'release', 'three', 'disks', 'film', 'commentary', 'Lee', 'third', 'disk', 'consists', 'bonus', 'material', 'further', 'elaborates', 'what', 'indeed', 'American', 'tragedy', 'spite', 'occasional', 'flaws', 'recommend', 'very', 'strongly.GFT', 'Amazon', 'Reviewer']",When the Levees Broke: A Requiem In Four Acts

No this is NOT my question in this instance.  My question in this instance is HOW could this have happened in the United States of America??  We can drop food to our enemies within a couple days after an earthquake, etc.  Where were WE????  This Documentary shows the first ""troops"" that showed up were the Mounted Police from Canada!!!  God has nothing to do with what happens AFTER the fact, this is left up to humanity.  After watching this many, many times I have to ask myself what have we lost as human beings. Where are our feelings and compassion? My words may sound harsh as it seems I am speaking against my Country, this is NOT the case.

1023955,A140XH16IKR4B0,B000J10F14,Jean E. Pouliot,"[1, 2]","""When the Levees Broke"" is Spike Lee's eloquent portrayal of the events and personalities of New Orleans who struggled in August 2005 and beyond through the assault and aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. Lee uses first-person accounts from those who left town early and those who withstood the storm and the difficult recovery period afterwards. Officials and celebrities like Mayor Ray Nagin, Louisiana Governor Kathleen Blanco, controversial New Orleans Policy Chief Eddie Compass and musician Wynton Marsalis are interviewed. But the ordinary people of New Orleans --good, bad and otherwise -- are the heroes of the film, and Lee gives the lion's share of screen time.Lee subtly addresses some of the myths that have grown up around Katrina. He uses newsroom tape of FEMA head Mike Brown and George Bush to make it clear that government knew how bad the coming storm was. He makes it clear also that all sorts of folks - black and white -- took the initiative to get out of town before the storm hit. And he tries to explain why so many, including those with few means -- the poor, elderly and sick of all colors - stayed behind to fend for themselves. Many who stayed were unable to leave due to illness of incapacity. Others seemed deeply conflicted about evacuating - choosing to remain close to home, a home often purchased at great cost in money and time.Lee lets residents be themselves, even when they make mistakes. He shows them airing ridiculous-sounding rumors, like the claim that the enormous explosions heard during the storm were from the levees being deliberately blown up. But Lee respects the residents enough Lee gives context to this fear, citing an earlier occasion when levees *were* dynamited. Lee documents nave residents flocking to the Superdome, believing that help was on its way, and assuming that government aid would soon arrive, as it did during 9/11 and other national emergencies. But the anguish of the residents is in plain sight. Shots of elderly residents brought back to view wrecked homes - the results of a lifetime of labor and love - are heartbreaking.The film shows Nagin and Blanco in far better light than they are normally shown. The Bush administration does not come off as well, and no federal officials were interviewed for the film, a serious shortcoming if intentional. Nagin, Blanco and others were nowhere near perfect in their reaction to the storm, but a legitimate question is whether the feds tried to cover their sins by spreading the blame down the chain of command.The film's first two discs comprise Acts I-IV, the main part of the film, describing the approach of the storm, its fury, the immediate aftermath and the dispersal of New Orleans' citizens across the nation. Disc 3 contains additional material focusing in the efforts Sean Penn, author Douglas Brinkley and others to rescue New Orleans residents. This disk spotlights the disorganization and incompetence that surrounded the post-Katrina response. The role of police seemed to have become preventing people from fleeing the city and using the stocks of police boats needed to rescue friends and family. Hearing first-hand tales of rescuers -- of residents trapped in their attics, of the non-involvement of police, of the complete absence of Red Cross or FEMA in the first days of the disaster, of insurers returning pittances for destroyed homes-- was harrowing and inexplicable. In the absence of explanations, no wonder people have thought the worst - that class, color and greed were driving the official response.Lee's film is a master work of the documentary form. Using images, mournful music and first-hand testimony, he builds an edifice of truth-telling that is far grander than the individual timbers that went into its construction. His pastiche of the faces, voices and emotions of New Orleanians most eloquently raises questions about the proper role of government. Is government a means of enriching oneself and one's friends, of satisfying one's personal ambitions or of flattering one's ego? Or is it, as some old document says, is instituted to ""establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity""? Whatever your answer, Lee's film shows government falling down in a big way when Katrina came storming into the Gulf in 2005. By showing us the results of government gone wrong, abetted by unaddressed poverty, hopelessness, dependence and racism, and assisted by official neglect, accidents and incompetence.Lee raises many questions and answers few. He does not (perhaps could not) interview everyone who might have shed light on his subject. He may even try too hard to prove a racist intent for the horrible things that went wrong in New Orleans. But the devastation he filmed - not just of buildings and possessions but of spirit, pride and hope - ought to haunt the viewer long after the end credits finish rolling. Lee does his best to end his work on a positive note. This sometimes seems like painting a happy smile on a corpse. Yet he wants to be hopeful, as hopeful as the people of New Orleans are themselves about the future. ""When the Levees Broke"" at the very least is a record on a personal level of what it was like to live through Hurricane Katrina. At best it is a clarion call to hold government accountable for the welfare of its citizens, regardless of color, class or cash flow.",5,When the rains came and help didn't,1207353600,"04 5,

Ms. LeBlanc, a passionate and articulate victim of the 2005 New Orleans flood, is one of many Big Easy residents who appears in the Spike Lee mega-documentary film WHEN THE LEVEES BROKE.  Her commentary proves to be one of many unforgettable aspects of this must-see work.Of course, by calling New Orleans residents victims of the August 2005 floodwaters, I oversimplify.  As WHEN THE LEVEES BROKE documents, for forty years responsible powers knew the New Orleans levees could not withstand the pressure of a hurricane such as Katrina but did nothing.  The Bush administration and F.E.M.A., who knew what was going to happen days in advance of the hurricane, did nothing.  And when the storm subsided and people needed rescue, food, and water, the Bush gang and F.E.M.A. dragged their feet, allowing preventable death and misery for several days before acting.WHEN THE LEVEES BROKE cuts no corners telling its story.  About the only lowlight of those tragic summer 2005 days it misses is Laura Bush's telling comment, where she referred to the storm as ""Hurricane Corrina"" at least twice in the same interview.While the illegal, immoral war in Iraq got most of the credit for the fall of the Republicans in the 2006 elections, the federal government's willful disregard for New Orleans had to be on voters' minds, too.  As I write this in March 2007, Louisiana governor Kathleen Blanco has announced she will not seek re-election because of low poll numbers, so it seems the people are repaying Republican Lite Democrats such as Ms. Blanco, too.  WHEN THE LEVEES BROKE closes with the Fats Domino song, ""Walking To New Orleans.""

I am a student of U.S History and politics here in England and have always been interested in the corruption of America. This amazing DVD shows that race relations have not really changed too much since the institutionalised southern racism of the 1960's. The DVD gives an emotional and moving detailed discussion and explanation of the twin tragedies of the hurricane and the pathetically inept Government and local response to the devastation. The DVD is not narrated, but instead the survivors, local officials and engineering/meterological experts tell their stories and explain exactly what went wrong, what happened and why, in their own series of interviews. Added with rare and powerfully emotional footage, still photographs with excellent editing and haunting music, it makes for a truly moving 4 hours, that never once gets boring or repetitive. How often can you say that about a 4 hour film?I remember the reports on TV over Katrina here in the U.K and how we were told about the rioting and looting day after day, how it was too dangerous to help the citizens of new orleans because there was so much gunfire and death in the city. It was all propaganda and total LIES LIES LIES. To see this makes you realise that this disinformation was designed for the media to sell Bush's story and cover the fact that the Government did virtually nothing to relieve starving, suffering, bereaved, sick and thirsty people who had literally lost everything but their lives. It's a disgusting way for the richest nation on earth to treat its own citizens and it makes me sick that this could have happened in the 21st century in the United States. Race and class still divide the nation, that's all glaringly obvious in the unbelievable stories on this film.I invite anyone who votes for Bush and Cheney to watch this film and think about what this man has done to damage your nation that brave men like Robert Kennedy, King, Malcolm X etc had to lose their lives to achieve,  equality for African America.",5,Magical and tragic television,1170547200,"02 4, 2007",2007,2069,"['simply', 'best', 'documentary', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'long', 'time', 'am', 'student', 'U.S', 'History', 'politics', 'here', 'England', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'interested', 'corruption', 'America', 'amazing', 'DVD', 'race', 'relations', 'have', 'not', 'really', 'changed', 'too', 'much', 'institutionalised', 'southern', 'racism', '1960', 'DVD', 'emotional', 'moving', 'detailed', 'discussion', 'explanation', 'twin', 'tragedies', 'hurricane', 'pathetically', 'inept', 'Government', 'local', 'response', 'devastation', 'DVD', 'not', 'narrated', 'instead', 'survivors', 'local', 'officials', 'engineering/meterological', 'experts', 'tell', 'stories', 'explain', 'exactly', 'what', 'went', 'wrong', 'what', 'happened', 'why', 'own', 'series', 'interviews', 'Added', 'rare', 'powerfully', 'emotional', 'footage', 'still', 'excellent', 'editing', 'haunting', 'music', 'truly', 'moving', '4', 'hours', 'never', 'once', 'boring', 'repetitive', 'How', 'often', 'can', 'say', 'about', '4', 'hour', 'film', 'remember', 'reports', 'TV', 'Katrina', 'here', 'U.K', 'how', 'were', 'told', 'rioting', 'looting', 'day', 'day', 'how', 'was', 'too', 'dangerous', 'help', 'citizens', 'new', 'orleans', 'was', 'so', 'much', 'gunfire', 'death', 'city', 'was', 'propaganda', 'total', 'LIES', 'LIES', 'LIES', 'see', 'realise', 'disinformation', 'was', 'designed', 'media', 'sell', 'Bush', 'story', 'cover', 'fact', 'Government', 'did', 'virtually', 'nothing', 'relieve', 'starving', 'suffering', 'bereaved', 'sick', 'thirsty', 'people', 'who', 'had', 'literally', 'lost', 'everything', 'lives', 'disgusting', 'way', 'richest', 'nation', 'earth', 'treat', 'own', 'citizens', 'sick', 'could', 'have', 'happened', '21st', 'century', 'United', 'States', 'Race', 'class', 'still', 'divide', 'nation', 'glaringly', 'obvious', 'unbelievable', 'stories', 'film.I', 'invite', 'anyone', 'who', 'Bush', 'Cheney', 'watch', 'film', 'think', 'what', 'man', 'done', 'damage', 'nation', 'brave', 'men', 'Robert', 'Kennedy', 'King', 'Malcolm', 'X', 'etc', 'had', 'lose', 'lives', 'achieve', 'equality', 'African', 'America']",When the Levees Broke: A Requiem In Four Acts

1023959,A5KMMY627T3W,B000J10F14,Kate Stokes,"[16, 24]","I have been a big fan of Spike Lee's work for years even though most of my friends have never understood why, or at least claimed not to. I liked this a lot, but I have several issues with it that keep me from giving it 5 stars.Since there are already so many well-written reviews on the good points of this film, I will cut to the chase and just detail the issues I have with it.1. This is not a documentary in the strictest sense. I wish they would come up with a new word for films like this and the films of people like Michael Moore. Incidentally, I really enjoy these films but the journalist inside me forces me to maintain the fact that these are not documentaries in the true sense of the word. There is a great deal of documentation that goes on in this film, but it is mostly pointed in one direction in accordance with the truth as the filmmaker sees it. Again, even though I happen to agree with most of it, I still feel obligated to point this out. the eidting and the framing of shots in several cases were deliberately done to accentuate the POV of the director, not to mention many of the interviews. Lee did not document katrina's aftermath; he decided what he thought about Katrina and then found footage and conducted interviews in line with his existing thesis. He documented his opinion, which may or may not be in line with the truth. In some cases it was, in some cases it obviously was not.2. The conspiracy theory stuff should have been left out. it was so outrageous that it was distracting. I am referring to the claims that the levees were dynamited in 2005 in order to flood the poor black neighborhoods to save the rich white ones. This is so hyperbolic it is almost insulting.3. The slavery metaphors were also hyperbolic, and should have been left out. Katrina's aftermath was many things, but it has nothing to do with slavery other than the fact that they both involved black people and both took place in the south.4. This last point dovetails with point number 1. In 4 hours, with most of the 4 hours being interviews, he did not offer a single interview that was dissenting from his pre-planned POV. His POV is the following: poor people and/or black people are allowed to stay vulnerable by the powers that be. When a disaster occurs that is made far worse by the existing vulnerabilities, the government makes a concerted effort not to help the victims because they are poor and black. Reasons advanced for this are racism and lack of political or economic power. Not a single interview was shown that offered a dissenting opinion from this POV. Not one. I happen to think that the reasons shown are mostly true, but not 100% of the story a long shot. Somewhere between 50 and 80% of the story, sure. Where is the other part of the story? it isn't here. Lee seems to be convinved that there are no other explantions, and he is unwilling to let us listen to anyone who might.Furthermore, there are no interviews shown in which anyone dissents from the opinion that when disaster happens, it is the sole 100% responsibility of the government (state or federal) to fix everything and take care of everything for the victims. I believe they certainly have a role, but there seems to be an opinion of many of the victims--and Mr. Lee--that the government is solely responsible for every aspect. There was not one mention of any personal responsibility on the part of the victims. Not one sentence. I personally have a problem with this attitude. I do not live my life based on the assumption or the belief that the government is going to be held 100% responsible for my well-being in case of disaster striking. In fact, just the opposite maybe. this film seems to suggest that the government is--and should be--100% responsible for the well-being of it's citizenry. There is 0% responsibility to be laid on the backs of the victims. I'm sorry, but I fundamentally disagree with this position, and I think a person holds this position at their own peril. I'm not asking Mr. Lee or anyone else to agree with this; I just wish he included at least a 30 second interview with someone who did.Again, I liked the film a lot and there are many things I liked about it, but I feel like all of those sentiments have already been expressed here in detail so I left them out of my particular review.

1023962,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B000J10F14,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[108, 122]","This may seem like an absolutely ridiculous thing to say--but I wanted to approach ""When The Levees Broke"" with a totally open mind.  While the flooding of New Orleans is easily one of the greatest disasters in American history, it is also one of the most politically charged subjects of recent years.  While I've never found Spike Lee to be the most balanced of directors, I was curious to see how his epic documentary about the aftermath of Katrina would fare.  I'm pleased to report that a concerted effort was made to include alternating viewpoints and perceptions.  That's why I attempted to leave my own preconceived ideas on the doorstep--I wanted to judge this piece on its merit as opposed to its (or my) political agenda.Basically, ""Levees"" is constructed in four episodes--each roughly an hour.  Part 1 details the incoming storm and its initial impact on the area.  Here we see rescue efforts amid the flooding and many harrowing images of people just trying to survive.  Part 2 deals with the immediate aftermath, as the evacuees are staged throughout the city awaiting assistance.  Here, we start to share in the real frustration of everyone that assistance is slow and, in some cases, nonexistent.  Part 3 documents a period of time where the evacuees adjust--waiting for a chance to return to their homes and/or rejoin their families.  And Part 4 comes as people start to return to the city--to the horrors and reality that all is lost.  The latter parts continue to focus on opportunities missed by FEMA to care for the victims, the Corps of Engineers to adequately defend the city, and the insurance companies who failed to make good on their obligations.But most of the criticism is left for the national government and, in particular, the Bush administration.  And, again, whatever your political leanings--this is definitely a topic that needs to be examined.  Through news footage and interviews from major participants including Mayor Naggin and Governor Blanco, you get a real perspective on what was going on behind the scenes.  It may not be the most flattering portrait one could hope for--but it is surprisingly fair.  And it is necessary to view our shortcomings as a nation facing disaster--if, for no other reason, than to prevent them from happening again.It is heartbreaking what was left in the wake of Katrina.  But it's even more upsetting to think it may have been prevented--or at least, after the storm, given more import by those who might have made a difference.  Many of the documentary's subjects are New Orleans residents who put a human and personal touch on the catastrophe--and Lee has, thankfully, selected a diverse group from different socioeconomic backgrounds.  That's what makes ""Levees"" most effective--looking at a broad canvas.Most of the interviewees are noticeably and justifiably frustrated by the situations and much political talk ensues.  I think the criticisms, in most cases, are apt.  However, the one thing I wished ""Levees"" would have done more is to acknowledge the stellar support from individuals who made a difference working within the organizations that are widely being disparaged.  There were many people who worked within the system who were not villains--yet these people (many who worked for months on the streets of New Orleans or with the evacuees) are largely dismissed.  This is a shame for them and a blemish on an otherwise exemplary documentary.

Using images that will tear at your heartstrings, archival footage, music and lots of individual stories, this is a full exploration of exactly what happened.There's lots of anger here, and lots of sadness.  Death  and horror seem to be everywhere  There's a man who tells the story of how his elderly mother died while they were seeking immediate shelter in the Superdome and how, four days later when he was finally evacuated he had to leave her body.  People were herded like animals into the Superdome for days and days.  There was no water, no food, no working bathrooms.  It was hot and humid.  There was no escape.  Other people were left on ramps above the highways and when they tried to walk off, they were met with guns from residents who didn't want them in their neighborhood.  Reports of looting were everywhere.  And the mayor and governor were arguing about what had to be done.  Where was the U.S. government?  Why were they able to send help to victims of the Tsunami the year before in Indonesia and could not send troops to help their own people.Every single aspect of the Katrina story is horrible. There's even a segment when the cameras focused on the bloated bodies found in the aftermath.  Later, even after the worst was over, the trailers that people were promised took six months to get.  And families were split up when they were evacuated to other states.  Then, the insurance companies reneged on paying insurance claims.  It was just one awful thing after another.Some of it can be blamed on the endemic racism that has always been present in New Orleans.  Most of the people in the film who were affected the worst were African Americans, although there certainly were many whites with equally horrible stories.  Mostly, though, all of these people were poor.  They didn't have the means to run from the city as they didn't own cars.  All of them had been through hurricanes before.  They had sat them out then.  They had survived.  But Katrina was different.Applause to Spike Lee for making this film!  He doesn't appear in it but it certainly shows his unique view of the world.  Of course I had seen news footage in the past and I remember following the story as it was happening.

Certainly, there were racial situations, and the accompanying anger by those involved, but this riveting and emotional account must be taken objectively. First, this is not about Katrina as much as the breaking of the levees, as the title suggests. The warnings were out there, and those who chose to ignore those warnings were only unfortunate victims. Many had no mobility to go anywhere but the Superdome; it's also made clear that the horrors of the Superdome were more the result of backed up toilets than evil behavior, as reported on the news by angry victims. Indeed, people with infirmities died; put in corners, while the living waited for help that never came. No little kids were raped or murdered. Mr. Lee blamed all the right people: the government at large, lazy FEMA attention, the governor. It also clearly stated the heroism and frustration of the local police and fire-fighters, and the essential efforts of the National Guard. I was disappointed that not enough was said about people stuck in retirement homes and hospitals, the saddest of the ordeal. It also showed Mayor Nagin as a hero, as opposed to the confused pseudo-leader that he is. The recovery of New Orleans after the levee breach is slow, I think due to ambivalent bureaucratic red-tape. Mississippi was hit harder than Louisana by Katrina, and they've almost completely rebuilt. I have a good friend who evacuated her home, and came back to a lot of damage; she went to work as a relief worker, but those who applied for aid were mostly lying about their situations (saying they owned a home, when they only rented, etc.). Lies like that can hold up a recovery effort. Fraud on that level closed the agency for which she worked. I only mention that because her accounts of the ordeal had compelled me to buy this 3-disc DVD set. It's definitely worth watching. I am a white male from Milwaukee, and in my job I helped a few Katrina survivors get housing up here. Calling Spike Lee a racist is as silly as saying that Katrina was orchestrated by the Government to hurt Black people. I've heard both comments; both are absurd. Mr. Lee has presented a clear, horrific expos&eacute; of things that might have been better, had the government responded properly. Our aid to Sri Lanka after the tsunami was quicker and more complete. ""When the Levees Broke"" should give the viewer an insight to the first-hand situation, and the emotions that result can be of futility, hopelessness or anger, but it definitely creates an emotion.

It also shows, with a very human face, the inner torture and destruction of those who did not die in the disaster, but were left behind to watch hopelessness suck their life away.Spike Lee has made many amazing, controversial, and passionate films. NONE IS MORE IMPORTANT THAT THIS ONE! The scenes, images, and tales contained in this masterwork are raw, angry, painful, and so vibrantly alive that it is mindblowing.

1023983,A3BJDFGSLXFB36,B000J10F14,R. Legendre,"[9, 11]","I am from New Orleans and I am a victim of Hurricane Katrina. I lost my home as well as 98% of all of my possesions. Luckily, I was able to evacuate to a relative's house in Baton Rouge (about 75 miles west of N.O.), so my family and I were spared the immediate aftermath and the horrific conditions experienced by those who were unable to get out of the city.Through this film, however, I was able to feel the pain and loss of my neighbors and friends. It was very difficult for me to watch and I broke down and cried several times. New Orleans is my home and will ALWAYS be my home. No matter where I go or end up living (I have relocated and now live about 30 west of N.O.), New Orleans will forever be a part of my soul. If you are not from there, you probably wouldn't understand. It was so damn difficult to see familiar places and people undergoing such a tragedy.A piece of my heart died on August 29th, 2005 and another piece died when I watched this film, but I HAD to see it. It is important for eveyone to see this film because it raises many questions that have yet to be answered. How can such brutal and barbaric conditions be allowed to continue for so long in one of the richest countries in the world? Why did it take so long to get help? Why was the city so unprepared for such a catastrophe? Why have the problems NOT been solved 2 years after the event?I still don't know any of the answers.All I know is that I must own this film. I must have it to show my children one day (my daughter was 2 at the time the storm hit and my 2nd child is on the way) so that they never forget where we came from and the many mistakes our generation made when trying to deal with this crisis. Hopefully, others will show this to their children as well so that they can learn from these mistakes and make sure that something like this never happens again.The ONLY pet peeve I have with the film (it's a small one) is that it seems to take the point of view of the black, underprivileged portion of the city's population. Yes, these were the majority of those that suffered in the aftermath, but Katrina affected EVERYONE in this region. I felt that the objectivity of the film should have been a bit more balanced.As for the reviewer who thought this film was funny, I wish you peace and hope that one day your heart will be softened and you will learn to have compassion for your fellow man. Yes, New Orleanians suffered, but we are ALL citizens of the planet Earth. When a man dies, we are all diminished because we are all a part of mankind.",5,A legacy for my children...,1182988800,"06 28, 2007",2007,2548,"['am', 'New', 'Orleans', 'am', 'victim', 'Hurricane', 'Katrina', 'lost', 'home', 'as', 'well', '98', '%', 'possesions', 'Luckily', 'was', 'able', 'evacuate', 'relative', 'house', 'Baton', 'Rouge', '75', 'miles', 'west', 'N.O', 'family', 'were', 'spared', 'immediate', 'aftermath', 'horrific', 'conditions', 'experienced', 'who', 'were', 'unable', 'get', 'city.Through', 'film', 'however', 'was', 'able', 'feel', 'pain', 'loss', 'neighbors', 'friends', 'was', 'very', 'difficult', 'watch', 'broke', 'down', 'cried', 'several', 'times', 'New', 'Orleans', 'home', 'will', 'ALWAYS', 'be', 'home', 'matter', 'where', 'go', 'end', 'up', 'living', 'have', 'relocated', 'now', 'live', '30', 'west', 'N.O', 'New', 'Orleans', 'will', 'forever', 'be', 'part', 'soul', 'are', 'not', 'there', 'probably', 'would', ""n't"", 'understand', 'was', 'so', 'damn', 'difficult', 'see', 'familiar', 'places', 'people', 'undergoing', 'such', 'tragedy.A', 'piece', 'heart', 'died', 'August', '29th', '2005', 'piece', 'died', 'when', 'watched', 'film', 'HAD', 'see', 'important', 'eveyone', 'see', 'film', 'many', 'questions', 'have', 'yet', 'be', 'answered', 'How', 'can', 'such', 'brutal', 'barbaric', 'conditions', 'be', 'allowed', 'continue', 'so', 'long', 'one', 'richest', 'countries', 'world', 'Why', 'did', 'take', 'so', 'long', 'get', 'help', 'Why', 'was', 'city', 'so', 'unprepared', 'such', 'catastrophe', 'Why', 'have', 'problems', 'NOT', 'been', 'solved', '2', 'years', 'event', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'answers.All', 'know', 'must', 'own', 'film', 'must', 'have', 'show', 'children', 'one', 'day', 'daughter', 'was', '2', 'time', 'storm', 'hit', '2nd', 'child', 'way', 'never', 'forget', 'where', 'came', 'many', 'mistakes', 'generation', 'made', 'when', 'trying', 'deal', 'crisis', 'Hopefully', 'others', 'will', 'show', 'children', 'well', 'can', 'learn', 'mistakes', 'make', 'sure', 'something', 'never', 'ONLY', 'pet', 'peeve', 'have', 'film', 'small', 'one', 'take', 'point', 'view', 'black', 'underprivileged', 'portion', 'city', 'population', 'Yes', 'were', 'majority', 'suffered', 'aftermath', 'Katrina', 'affected', 'EVERYONE', 'region', 'felt', 'objectivity', 'film', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'bit', 'more', 'balanced.As', 'reviewer', 'who', 'thought', 'film', 'was', 'funny', 'wish', 'peace', 'hope', 'one', 'day', 'heart', 'will', 'be', 'softened', 'will', 'learn', 'have', 'compassion', 'fellow', 'man', 'Yes', 'New', 'Orleanians', 'suffered', 'are', 'citizens', 'planet', 'Earth', 'When', 'man', 'are', 'diminished', 'are', 'part', 'mankind']",When the Levees Broke: A Requiem In Four Acts

I was excited to see it on a DVD shelf at Target and quickly bought it.  I started watching it the same evening and found myself completely absorbed in the heartbreaking and shameful story of Hurricane Katrina.  During Act II of the film I found myself wondering if I should continue watching because the anger I remember feeling as the actual event unfolded on television was rekindled in a very unsettling way.  I once again felt ashamed of this country and its deeply entrenched denial of race as a baromenter of qualification for basic human dignity and respect.  I think the terrible response of the government to Katrina was all about race and class (there were, after all, some poor whites who suffered as well).  I have only two questions, ""How is it after Katrina and Iraq that even 39% of the American people still believe in Bush?  What more evidence does a nation need that its leader is a bumbling fool (and a dangerous one at that)?""Kudos to Spike Lee for what I believe will be the film of record on the Katrina disaster.

Sohi,"[0, 0]","Near the end of Spike Lee's four hour documentary, the jazz trumpter, Wynton Marsalis states something to the effect that this is a signature moment in American history when a mirror is being held up and if you look at the reflection, you might not like what you see. Beyond the story of the devastating tragedy suffered by the people of New Orleans, this film holds a mirror up to a nation where during a moment of crisis the government's responsibility to its people seemed an afterthought at best. I spent eight hours with this film during the week I watched it. First I watched it as it was originally shown and then again with Spike Lee's stirring director's commentary. This is an angry film and Lee does not hold back in his condemnation of the many people responsible for the disaster or their response to it. Lee emphasizes that the disaster did not occur because of Katrina but because of the levees being ill-equipped to handle a hurricane of Katrina's magnitude. People's lives were destroyed because of human error and those responsible held themselves above reparation.This is a film that provokes feelings of sadness and anger. It's filled with images that are absolutely haunting. Yet, as Lee points out at the end of his commentary, ""When the Levees Broke"" is ultimately a document of the human spirit, maybe even a hopeful film. Despite the incredible adversity the survivors of Katrina have faced, the film shows how many of them have endured.Whether or not you agree with the film's viewpoint, ""When the Levees Broke"" is a film that demands to be seen.",5,One of Spike Lee's best films,1177113600,"04 21, 2007",2007,1572,"['end', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'four', 'hour', 'documentary', 'jazz', 'trumpter', 'Wynton', 'Marsalis', 'something', 'effect', 'signature', 'moment', 'American', 'history', 'when', 'mirror', 'being', 'held', 'up', 'look', 'reflection', 'might', 'not', 'like', 'what', 'see', 'Beyond', 'story', 'devastating', 'tragedy', 'suffered', 'people', 'New', 'Orleans', 'film', 'mirror', 'up', 'nation', 'where', 'moment', 'crisis', 'government', 'responsibility', 'people', 'seemed', 'afterthought', 'best', 'spent', 'eight', 'hours', 'film', 'week', 'watched', 'First', 'watched', 'was', 'originally', 'shown', 'then', 'again', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'stirring', 'director', 'commentary', 'angry', 'film', 'Lee', 'not', 'hold', 'back', 'condemnation', 'many', 'people', 'responsible', 'disaster', 'response', 'Lee', 'disaster', 'did', 'not', 'occur', 'Katrina', 'levees', 'being', 'ill-equipped', 'handle', 'hurricane', 'Katrina', 'magnitude', 'People', 'lives', 'were', 'destroyed', 'human', 'error', 'responsible', 'held', 'reparation.This', 'film', 'feelings', 'sadness', 'anger', 'filled', 'images', 'are', 'absolutely', 'haunting', 'Yet', 'Lee', 'out', 'end', 'commentary', 'When', 'Levees', 'Broke', 'ultimately', 'document', 'human', 'spirit', 'maybe', 'even', 'hopeful', 'film', 'incredible', 'adversity', 'survivors', 'Katrina', 'have', 'faced', 'film', 'how', 'many', 'have', 'endured.Whether', 'not', 'agree', 'film', 'viewpoint', 'When', 'Levees', 'Broke', 'film', 'be', 'seen']",When the Levees Broke: A Requiem In Four Acts

This documentary achieves this goal - we walk a mile in the shoes of those who live in New Orleans just before, during and after hurricane Katrina.  Particular attention is paid to the shameful five days after Katrina when our government did nothing to help the people of New Orleans who were stranded with no electricity, food or water.I learned so much from this documentary about the spirit of New Orleans, the people that make up this unique place and how they were failed by local, state and federal government.  It is astonishing.  Spike Lee showed intense respect for the people of New Orleans, he did what he does best in the background completely hidden.  He let the people speak for themselves and he made the correct choices.  He let people of all income levels, races, and walks of life speak about what happened in intensely personal ways through the lenses of their own experiences.  More importantly he let them speak in their own words including profanity, frustration, racial slurs, and raw emotion as well as through prayer, song and music and thoughtful criticism.He also exposed the shameful inaction of the federal government.  There were interviews with New Orleans Mayor Ray Naggin, the Louisiana Governor, Lt. Governor, former mayor, Al Sharpton, Harry Belafonte and many other local politicians.  The most surprising and eloquent critique came from Al Sharpton.  Both his media critique which was thoughtful and fair (referring to American citizens who were displaced by Katrina as refugees) and his reaction to Barbara Bush's comments about how the hurricane was better for the poor people who relocated to Texas (not a direct quote - what she said was much more insensitive) while she was being interviewed in the Houston arena in front of the New Orleans natives.He includes famous and notable people including, Sean Penn, Michael Eric Dyson, Harry Belefonte and others sharing their insights but he never let's the expert, famous or intellectual voices take over; he never forgets the focus is the people of New Orleans.  In this documentary you can feel his deep respect for them.He gives a picture of their lives before, a history of New Orleans culture and what makes it unique and he uses the notable and learned effectively to set the background and add to the viewers understanding of what makes New Orleans special.  The expert voices add to our picture of the issues related to Katrina but are not the primary source of information about the people of New Orleans and what happened during and after Katrina.  New Orleans natives are the source of information about the experience of Hurricane Katrina and Spike Lee works hard to ensure that they are the focus.  The experts are like a group of spices they add flavor but don't change the substance of the dish; he uses experts to shed light on the story but never supplants or marginalizes the people who lived it in the discussion of Katrina and its lasting impact.  This is part of what makes this documentary so powerful is you hear from people who lived it and are still living it.He also uses actual news footage and interviews members of the media who covered Katrina including Soledad O'Brien and the radio talk show host who did the now famous interview with Mayor Naggin which is credited with embarrassing and shaming the Bush Administration into action; Lee chooses not to include the entire interview but it is available online.Spike Lee also explores the power of the institution of the Presidency and how important it can be when wielded properly on behalf of citizens in need.  It matters what the President and members of his administration were doing while people suffered and died for five days after the hurricane.  President Bush on vacation, VP Cheney was out fishing, Condoleezza Rice buying shoes and seeing Spam-A lot while people suffered and died.  Lee finds a contrasting example in President Lyndon Johnson.  Johnson, another Texan, went to the Gulf region after a hurricane in the middle of the night with a flashlight to tell the people that he was their President and to lend aid and comfort right away; he put citizens above ego and he was there.Spike Lee did what many documentary makers struggle to do, he found a way to let viewers like me share in the experience depicted on film.

1023988,A2RAU617VTJMBX,B000J10F14,Sigrid Macdonald,"[2, 3]","9/11 was terrifying.  For the first time in decades, we were attacked on our own soil.  But the assault came from outsiders.  Even more frightening is to think there may be a malevolent group within the country that kills people by its own negligence.Prior to watching Spike Lee's masterpiece, I had navely thought that New Orleans was wiped out by Hurricane Katrina.  In fact, Lee argues that the United States Army Corps of Engineers designed the levees so poorly that they could not withstand anything stronger than a category two hurricane.  Given the fact that the city is surrounded by water on all sides, it was inevitable that it would be hit by a storm much more powerful than category two, thus, the engineers-- who can't be sued -- bear an enormous amount of responsibility for the catastrophe that befell hundreds of thousands of people.Worse was the downright embarrassing and disgraceful response of the Bush administration.  It took George Bush 12 days to get down to New Orleans.  Meanwhile, he was on vacation and making speeches about Iraq (hey, let's get our priorities straight!)  while Dick Cheney was flyfishing and Condoleezza Rice was buying shoes.  Spike Lee shows some old footage of Lyndon B. Johnson making a clumsy appearance in New Orleans following Hurricane Betsy -- old LBJ was out there in the dark with his flashlight and down-homey kind of way but at least he was there.  People knew that he cared.  FEMA, as we all know, took five days to get to the city although somehow it only took our government two days to go across the world to help the tsunami victims.  One can only conclude that it is deliberate disdain and racism or a complete lack of concern for people of lower incomes that resulted in such a horrifically slow and inadequate response to this tragedy.Spike Lee, who I've always loved, tells the story of Katrina through the words of those who lived through it -- from rich to poor, black to white, the important to the ""ordinary.""  Their tales moved me to tears and to an angry rage as the story unfolded from the beginning of the chaos to the cleanup -- or so-called -- and the bailouts of so many insurance companies who refused to pay up.One thing that I would have appreciated in this HBO series was a few more facts.  After watching for four hours, I still don't know exactly how many people were killed or injured.  Also, there was a reference early on to the fact that the levees had been dynamited during Betsy and that some people suspected that the same may have happened during Katrina in order to flood out the homes of the poorest people to save the rich.  That's a serious allegation and it deserved more time and attention in the film.Otherwise, this DVD was fantastic.  It was moving and irreverent -- a real eye-opener and must-see.

1023989,A3KOMZ79UJSZ2I,B000J10F14,Soulboogiealex,"[16, 24]","When the levees broke in New Orleans it came to be one of the most telling events about American Society. Poverty literally came floating to the surface. For those living outside the US the disaster was a cynical awakening. What is perceived as one of the richest nations in the world, a nation of opportunity and promise, suddenly looked like a third world country. Of course everyone in Europe is aware of the polarisation that is inhibited in the American social economical and political system, but it never became as clear during this disaster. Even though one could look at the disaster from an ecological point of view, it is mainly the social economical and political point of view Spike Lee's taking in this documentary.The film takes four hours to tell the ""tale"" behind the New Orleans catastrophe, putting the spotlight on nearly every aspect of the disaster. The documentary's main strength is that it tells the tale though the eyes of New Orleans natives and politicians as well, ""When the Levees Broke"" seem to give a fair and balanced view of the events surrounding New Orleans. Governor Kathleen Blanco, Mayor Ray Nagin, Wynton Marsalis and Harry Belafonte are familiar faces for Europeans but are not those who keep the film alive. It's the tales of ordinary people in the street, from the Lower Ninth Ward and the better parts of New Orleans, who grab your attention and do not let you go during the full four hours Spike takes to tell the story of Katrina.A lot of the images shown are familiar to us, the images of a crammed and crowded Super Dome, images of looting, people on the roof tops, some images less so, mainly the images of the bodies floating, the debris scattered across the city months later and New Orleans citizens displaced through out the nation months later. ""When the Levees Broke"" paints a very complete picture of this catastrophe, without going in to the political ramifications portrait here, one cannot help but watch this movie without a growing feeling of anger in your gut. Through out the film it becomes clear that politicians abandoned its constituents long before the disaster and hardly felt any urgency or compassion when Katrina hit. It becomes painfully clear that most politicians do not know what is going on in the ""bottom"" of society and worse, they might not even care.Cut throughout the movie is the music of New Orleans. Spike makes sparse use of the city's music as if he wants to avoid drawing a public who'll pick up the music for the carnival and turn a blind eye to the human catastrophe. The main focus is on funeral music; as if Lee wants to say that Katrina could be the death blow to the city if we don't act as a nation. Yet the joyous sub-text of the New Orleans funeral marching bands also harbour a promise of a city that could rise again.",5,Poverty Comes Floating to the Surface,1164499200,"11 26, 2006",2006,2816,"['When', 'levees', 'broke', 'New', 'Orleans', 'came', 'be', 'one', 'most', 'telling', 'events', 'American', 'Society', 'Poverty', 'literally', 'came', 'floating', 'surface', 'living', 'US', 'disaster', 'was', 'cynical', 'awakening', 'What', 'perceived', 'one', 'richest', 'nations', 'world', 'nation', 'opportunity', 'promise', 'suddenly', 'looked', 'third', 'world', 'country', 'course', 'everyone', 'Europe', 'aware', 'polarisation', 'inhibited', 'American', 'social', 'economical', 'political', 'system', 'never', 'became', 'clear', 'disaster', 'Even', 'one', 'could', 'look', 'disaster', 'ecological', 'point', 'view', 'mainly', 'social', 'economical', 'political', 'point', 'view', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'taking', 'documentary.The', 'film', 'four', 'hours', 'tell', 'tale', 'New', 'Orleans', 'catastrophe', 'putting', 'spotlight', 'nearly', 'aspect', 'disaster', 'documentary', 'main', 'strength', 'tale', 'eyes', 'New', 'Orleans', 'natives', 'politicians', 'as', 'well', 'When', 'Levees', 'Broke', 'seem', 'give', 'fair', 'balanced', 'view', 'events', 'surrounding', 'New', 'Orleans', 'Governor', 'Kathleen', 'Blanco', 'Mayor', 'Ray', 'Nagin', 'Wynton', 'Marsalis', 'Harry', 'Belafonte', 'are', 'familiar', 'Europeans', 'are', 'not', 'who', 'keep', 'film', 'alive', 'tales', 'ordinary', 'people', 'street', 'Lower', 'Ninth', 'Ward', 'better', 'parts', 'New', 'Orleans', 'who', 'grab', 'attention', 'do', 'not', 'let', 'go', 'full', 'four', 'hours', 'Spike', 'tell', 'story', 'Katrina.A', 'lot', 'images', 'shown', 'are', 'familiar', 'images', 'crammed', 'crowded', 'Super', 'Dome', 'images', 'looting', 'people', 'roof', 'tops', 'images', 'less', 'so', 'mainly', 'images', 'bodies', 'floating', 'debris', 'scattered', 'city', 'months', 'later', 'New', 'Orleans', 'citizens', 'displaced', 'nation', 'months', 'later', 'When', 'Levees', 'Broke', 'very', 'complete', 'picture', 'catastrophe', 'going', 'political', 'ramifications', 'portrait', 'here', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'watch', 'movie', 'growing', 'feeling', 'anger', 'gut', 'film', 'clear', 'politicians', 'abandoned', 'constituents', 'long', 'disaster', 'hardly', 'felt', 'urgency', 'compassion', 'when', 'Katrina', 'hit', 'painfully', 'clear', 'most', 'politicians', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'what', 'going', 'bottom', 'society', 'worse', 'might', 'not', 'even', 'care.Cut', 'movie', 'music', 'New', 'Orleans', 'Spike', 'sparse', 'use', 'city', 'music', 'avoid', 'drawing', 'public', 'who', ""'ll"", 'pick', 'up', 'music', 'carnival', 'turn', 'blind', 'eye', 'human', 'catastrophe', 'main', 'focus', 'funeral', 'music', 'Lee', 'say', 'Katrina', 'could', 'be', 'death', 'blow', 'city', 'do', ""n't"", 'act', 'nation', 'joyous', 'sub-text', 'New', 'Orleans', 'funeral', 'marching', 'bands', 'also', 'harbour', 'promise', 'city', 'could', 'rise', 'again']",When the Levees Broke: A Requiem In Four Acts
1023990,AT07UZQQR7ZEH,B000J10F14,"Stephen H. Wood ""Film scholar and vintage mov...","[3, 5]","Spike Lee's monumental six hour WHEN THE LEVEES BROKE is an enthralling account of the devastation of Hurricane Katrina, which left much of New Orleans under water in late August 2005.  Called a Requiem in Four Acts (plus a 105 minute Epilogue), the HBO miniseries is a heartbreaking and angry blend of documentary footage of the flood damage, attack on the federal government for not being in New Orleans in timely fashion, and oral history by proud survivors.Each act is about an hour long.  Act One begins with the hurricane starting on August 28, 2005.  I played this hour with Mr. Lee's audio commentary, which seems to blame the federal government in general and President George Bush specifically for not being in New Orleans.  ""He didn't give a [damn],"" replies Spike.  We get information on two previous Gulf States hurricanes, one in 1927 and Betsy in 1965.  Mr. Lee shows CNN and BBC footage of newspeople and the flood damage, then asks where our own federal government and FEMA were.  A black male mayor and a white woman governor hate each other's guts as people die.  Sean Penn is one of the heroes of this miniseries, helping rescue dozens of people from filthy water.  Spike again (and his commentary is very heavy-handed and angry) wants to know why Bush and no one in his cabinet showed up in New Orleans for a full week?  According to Mr. Lee, the Canadian Mounties came down from Vancouver quicker than Bush and company did.  When Spike stops talking and ranting against our government, his survivors have powerful and sad tales to tell of fleeing the devastation, then trying to get back to their homes, as we watch the flood devastation.  The hour ends with evacuees in the hot and smelly Super Dome.Act Two has evacuees still in the Super Dome or the Convention Center with no food or water or toilets.  The National Guard arrives and threatens to shoot innocent Americans trying to get back to their home ruins.  The mayor of New Orleans is ineffectual, and the pit bull governor supports the National Guard.  Spike Lee shakes his head aurally on the audio commentary:  ""Even in the 21st Century, even in America, this is still happening.""  There is brilliant helicopter footage of the devastation, but it is from the BBC, not our own government.  Mr. Lee proves with documentary footage that George Bush knew from the Weather Service of a probable hurricane about to hit New Orleans a day after August 27th, but it took him TWELVE DAYS to get down to the flood site.  ""He just didn't give a [damn],"" comments Spike again.  He then adds that if the federal government really did not know what was going on or what to do, maybe they were not qualified to hold their jobs.  The National Guard again tried to kill looters and other flood victims, until the Army showed up:  ""Put those guns down. These are American citizens.""  Act Two ends with a montage of dead bodies.I played Acts Three and Four without Spike Lee's unnecessary commentary relentlessly attacking the federal government.  The miniseries plays much more effectively with the flood survivors themselves asking where the federal government, particularly FEMA, was.  People are migrating to Arkansas, Texas, and Tennessee, but especially Houston, Texas.  150,000 people there were homeless and jobless.  Vice President Cheney comes down to New Orleans and is told to go [hang] himself; it takes two full weeks for Bush to get on national TV.  Worst of all is Barbara Bush in a Houston homeless shelter; she insensitively suggests that maybe the survivors are better off now than in poverty level New Orleans.  She hangs herself verbally with no assistance from Spike Lee.  He lets survivors eloquently tell their own stories:  ""We aren't refugees, we are American citizens.""  FEMA is a national joke and disgrace.  The people are helping themselves without federal government help, so maybe FEMA and other government agencies should be abolished, survivors suggest.  As a black woman revisits the ruins of a house she has lived in all her life, there is the theme of rebuilding New Orleans ""because it is our home and where everything we love is.""  Two of those things are music and cultural rituals.  A psychiatrist speaks about an increase in suicides and suicidal thoughts among his patients.  A woman holds up a photo of a five year old girl.  Her sad funeral ends Act Three of WHEN THE LEVEES RISE.I also played Act Four without Spike Lee's unnecessary and shrill commentary.  We open with music--a band and Mardi Gras, the spirit to celebrate is still in New Orleans.  Three or four months are going by, and the survivors complain that the federal government is just sitting on their thumbs.  A student learns his mom died in a house that was not searched, and the body was not buried for two months.  Survivors want to know repeatedly why we can fight a war in Iraq, but not give water or power to our own country.  Trailers sit empty in a trailer yard, waiting months for the federal government to give them to homeless people.  Worst of all are insurance companies that people have been paying premiums to for years.  They argue with survivors--benefits for hurricanes, but none for flooding, and this is flooding.  Nasty real estate companies want to buy up the land and bulldoze the ruined homes that owners want to rebuild.  The Army Corps of Engineers arrives, but isn't sure what to do.  Survivors say to look at what The Netherlands did to prevent a similar flooding.  Act 4 ends with sunset over the Mississippi River, then ten minutes of portraits of people alphabetically as a sort of people cast list.  ""Walking Through New Orleans"" plays on the soundtrack.  Terence Blanchard did the haunting trumpet and piano score for the whole movie.  The film editors are Geeta Ghanbhir and Nancy Novack, supervised by Sam Pollard.  They did a mammoth and magnificent job of combining oral history and documentary footage.  WHEN THE LEVEES BROKE may be Spike Lee's crowning achievement, though he is too quick to blame the federal government for everything bad; I'd love to hear what Bush and Cheney have to say.For DVD, Mr. Lee has added a 105 minute Act 5 Epilogue.  It is mostly oral history (blessedly without audio commentary) of where everyone was on August 28, 2005 and what they did in the days that followed this terrible New Orleans flood.  They range from actor Sean Penn (a real hero) to pastors and authors, lawyers and students, engineers and a medical examiner.  They are all backed by Terence Blanchard's trumpet and piano music score.  There was rampant police brutality, especially white against black, in the days that followed.  Penn talks powerfully of rescuing dozens of people in muddy water because the federal government had not shown up yet.  If FEMA could not figure out how to mobilize, the survivors rationalize, then maybe we don't need FEMA.  That's a sobering thought, the federal government saying that maybe the survivors are better off without our interference.  An engineer tries to explain what happened, why, and how to try and prevent it again in the future.  We hear from a chef, a doctor, and musicians.  A white trial lawyer sends out 7,000 claims to people he is trying to help, only to realize that a sizeable number of the people cannot read.  And through it all, FEMA is an ineffectual joke.  The city will survive and rebuild without federal government help.  Fade out on a rapper at the gate to a cemetery.I did not play it, but this enthralling 3-disk DVD of Spike Lee's WHEN THE LEVEES BROKE also features something called WATER IS RISING.  It is described as blending a gallery of photos with music by Terence Blanchard.  I commend this magnificent HBO miniseries to your rental and sales attention.  It will take you three nights, but is well worth that much time.",5,A masterpiece from Spike Lee,1179619200,"05 20, 2007",2007,7810,"['Spike', 'Lee', 'monumental', 'six', 'hour', 'THE', 'LEVEES',

1023992,A2XUW4IZP6UPDL,B000J10F14,To Be Simple,"[8, 12]","Spike Lee is a versatile director, but seems to be at his best when making documentaries. When the Levees Broke is a masterpiece of a documentary. Lee is able to capture the raw emotion of the people who lived through Katrina in a way that is honest and pure. There are quite a few comments that many film editors would have cut out, but Lee left them in. He lets the people speak for themselves without feeling like they need to engage in self censorship.The Katrina tragedy has so many stories and nuances to it that it would be impossible to cover everything. It would take many more hours to cover everything. Lee does a good job of covering the story from beginning to the aftermath. He weaves in a lot of stuff and even gives some nice historical and cultural context to the situation.I was expecting this film to be more politically charged than it is. Yes, the people voice their opinions about the government's response, but in the end Lee makes this a film about the people who survived Katrina. People can make up their own minds as to who is to blame. The bottom line is that this disaster is still having a large impact on tens of thousands of people who the media has forgotten about.
