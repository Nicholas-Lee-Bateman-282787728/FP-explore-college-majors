""boxset_fan""","[3, 4]","I really am confused over this release....I had also read that season 1 is actually season 2 and that each release will contain episodes from the ""real"" season 1. Once you have collected the whole series, you will have the complete season 1 and can purchase a box to put the discs in...So, in looking at netflix and the shows listed on the individual discs, they do not have Nightmare Bay 1 & 2 (first 2 episodes from season 2)listed at all... On disc 5, they have Panic at Malibu Bay (don't even know where that one came from) and In Deep (which is the first episode from the real season 1).If we are supposed to collect the last disc from each season to build the ""real"" season 1, why have other episodes on that disc as well? Doesn't make sense at all.........They should have just started with Season 1.......sounds like they are just trying to make more money with this scheme....After all, it's all about the buck......SHAME!

Baywatch aired on NBC Friday nights at 8pm up against ABC's TGIF and Full House, I still can't stand that show. First Look has decided to call season 2 season 1??? and for us die-hard NBC Baywatch fans call that season the lost or pilot season. First look is including a bonus disk with the original season 1 NBC episodes on it just a few though. So in order to have the original Season 1 NBC episodes you have to buy every Baywatch DVD box set they release to have one!!! Thats BS!!!!!!!!! Do they think NBC Baywatch won't sell so they have to do this to us? Have you ever heard of a Studio doing this! Hum Lets just skip that season and call it this and just release the next season?

1002070,A36QYTMMJ0O2IZ,B000GDH8J2,Sean Pasek,"[21, 26]","**Buyers looking for the real first season beware!  As indicated by other reviewers, this is NOT the true first season of Baywatch originally aired by NBC, but rather it begins with the next season.**IF the production details listed above are correct, then this is the true, first season of Baywatch which initially premiered on NBC back in 1989.  One of the reasons that I believe this to be true, is because the cast list corresponds with the NBC production.  Most of the cast was scrapped after the first season.  Only David Hasselhoff, Erika Eleniak, Billy Warlock, and Gregory Allan-Williams remained for another season. If I am wrong, and the production details are incorrect, then I will pass on this ""first"" season.To me, this is the only season of Baywatch that is worth watching.  The acting and stories are much better than what you'd find in the subsequent seasons.  While it's true, that the show flaunted female parts, it did focus, to some degree, on the lives and jobs of lifeguards of L.A. County.  Granted, they took some liberties with these roles, as you often found Mitch and his then friend, Craig Pomeroy (Parker Stevenson) employing themselves as crime-stoppers as well as lifeguards.You even had such veteran actors as Monte Markham playing the authoritarian Captain Don Thorpe, who always took his job as a lifeguard captain very seriously, and usually at the expense of all junior lifeguards around him.I think in some regards, the reason the show was so much better, was that they had a bigger budget to work with, being initially with NBC.  NBC was also interested in making sure that along with the ""extra skin"" that the show might be used to inspire saftey-consciousness as well.First season sees Mitch battling his ex-wife for custody of Hobe (who was then played by Brandon Call).  Call was brilliant in the role, and I felt that Jeremy Jackson wasn't as good in the seasons that followed.Also, Mitch was NOT revealed to be an ex-Navy Seal.  While buddy, Cort (John Allen Nelson) was later added to the cast, he was the only one who was considered a former SEAL.  As the personal history suggests from this season, Mitch has been a lifeguard for a long time, perhaps going back to high school, along-side best friend, Craig Pomeroy.Eddie Kramer (Billy Warlock) was a rookie lifeguard, alongside Shaunie McClane(Erika Eleniak). Eddie was the hot-headed kid from the wrong side of Philadelphia who loved to spend his free hours boxing.  The writers of the show quickly saw that the ""meat"" of their storyline was the relationship between Eddie and Shaunie.  Several episodes had storylines surrounding the romance.  Warlock and Eleniak eventually became engaged in real life.The cast also included Peter Phelps (Trevor) who played a rogue, Australian lifeguard.  He left the show halfway in.  Parker Stevenson played Craig Pomeroy, a veteran lifeguard who is torn between being a lifeguard and being a lawyer.  His wife, Gina, was played by Holly Gagnier.  Finally, there was also Shawn Weatherly (Jill Riley) who was another veteran lifeguard who was famously killed off by a shark attack in the middle of the season.NBC cancelled the show after the first season.  The final episode included a marriage proposal by Eddie to Shaunie.  Obviously after the show was given the ""go ahead"" by a new network, many of the storylines and origins were either removed altogether or altered in some way.Mitch's budding teenage son, Hobe, was reverted back to a young boy of about 10 or 11.Eddie and Shaunie's proposal was pretty much ditched.  Eddie would propose again toward the end of the next season.Craig Pomeroy would be written out of the show altogether.  One can assume that he quit.The show as actually good during this first season before it went ""playmate"" crazy.  This is the only season that I'm interested in purchasing.  For me, Baywatch began and ended after its first season.",4,This is the REAL first and only good season of this show,1160006400,"10 5, 2006",2006,3912,"['**Buyers', 'looking', 'real', 'first', 'season', 'beware', 'indicated', 'other', 'reviewers', 'NOT', 'true', 'first', 'season', 'Baywatch', 'originally', 'aired', 'NBC', 'rather', 'next', 'season', '**IF', 'production', 'details', 'listed', 'are', 'correct', 'then', 'true', 'first', 'season', 'Baywatch', 'initially', 'premiered', 'NBC', 'back', '1989', 'One', 'reasons', 'believe', 'be', 'true', 'cast', 'list', 'corresponds', 'NBC', 'production', 'Most', 'cast', 'was', 'scrapped', 'first', 'season', 'Only', 'David', 'Hasselhoff', 'Erika', 'Eleniak', 'Billy', 'Warlock', 'Gregory', 'Allan-Williams', 'remained', 'season', 'am', 'wrong', 'production', 'details', 'are', 'incorrect', 'then', 'will', 'pass', 'first', 'season.To', 'only', 'season', 'Baywatch', 'worth', 'watching', 'acting', 'stories', 'are', 'much', 'better', 'what', ""'d"", 'find', 'subsequent', 'seasons', 'true', 'show', 'flaunted', 'female', 'parts', 'did', 'focus', 'degree', 'lives', 'jobs', 'lifeguards', 'L.A.', 'County', 'Granted', 'took', 'liberties', 'roles', 'often', 'found', 'Mitch', 'then', 'friend', 'Craig', 'Pomeroy', 'Parker', 'Stevenson', 'employing', 'as', 'crime-stoppers', 'as', 'well', 'lifeguards.You', 'even', 'had', 'such', 'veteran', 'actors', 'Monte', 'Markham', 'playing', 'authoritarian', 'Captain', 'Don', 'Thorpe', 'who', 'always', 'took', 'job', 'lifeguard', 'captain', 'very', 'seriously', 'usually', 'expense', 'junior', 'lifeguards', 'him.I', 'think', 'regards', 'reason', 'show', 'was', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'was', 'had', 'bigger', 'budget', 'work', 'being', 'initially', 'NBC', 'NBC', 'was', 'also', 'interested', 'making', 'sure', 'extra', 'skin', 'show', 'might', 'be', 'used', 'inspire', 'saftey-consciousness', 'well.First', 'season', 'sees', 'Mitch', 'battling', 'ex-wife', 'custody', 'Hobe', 'who', 'was', 'then', 'played', 'Brandon', 'Call', 'Call', 'was', 'brilliant', 'role', 'felt', 'Jeremy', 'Jackson', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'good', 'seasons', 'followed.Also', 'Mitch', 'was', 'NOT', 'revealed', 'be', 'ex-Navy', 'Seal', 'buddy', 'Cort', 'John', 'Allen', 'Nelson', 'was', 'later', 'added', 'cast', 'was', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'was', 'considered', 'former', 'SEAL', 'personal', 'history', 'season', 'Mitch', 'been', 'lifeguard', 'long', 'time', 'perhaps', 'going', 'back', 'high', 'school', 'along-side', 'best', 'friend', 'Craig', 'Pomeroy.Eddie', 'Kramer', 'Billy', 'Warlock', 'was', 'rookie', 'lifeguard', 'alongside', 'Shaunie', 'McClane', 'Erika', 'Eleniak', 'Eddie', 'was', 'hot-headed', 'kid', 'wrong', 'side', 'Philadelphia', 'who', 'loved', 'spend', 'free', 'hours', 'boxing', 'writers', 'show', 'quickly', 'saw', 'meat', 'storyline', 'was', 'relationship', 'Eddie', 'Shaunie', 'Several', 'episodes', 'had', 'storylines', 'surrounding', 'romance', 'Warlock', 'Eleniak', 'eventually', 'became', 'engaged', 'real', 'life.The', 'cast', 'also', 'included', 'Peter', 'Phelps', 'Trevor', 'who', 'played', 'rogue', 'Australian', 'lifeguard', 'left', 'show', 'halfway', 'Parker', 'Stevenson', 'played', 'Craig', 'Pomeroy', 'veteran', 'lifeguard', 'who', 'torn', 'being', 'lifeguard', 'being', 'lawyer', 'wife', 'Gina', 'was', 'played', 'Holly', 'Gagnier', 'Finally', 'was', 'also', 'Shawn', 'Weatherly', 'Jill', 'Riley', 'who', 'was', 'veteran', 'lifeguard', 'who', 'was', 'famously', 'killed', 'off', 'shark', 'attack', 'middle', 'season.NBC', 'cancelled', 'show', 'first', 'season', 'final', 'episode', 'included', 'marriage', 'proposal', 'Eddie', 'Shaunie', 'Obviously', 'show', 'was', 'given', 'go', 'ahead', 'new', 'network', 'many', 'storylines', 'origins', 'were', 'either', 'removed', 'altogether', 'altered', 'way.Mitch', 'budding', 'teenage', 'son', 'Hobe', 'was', 'reverted', 'back', 'young', 'boy', '10', '11.Eddie', 'Shaunie', 'proposal', 'was', 'pretty', 'much', 'ditched', 'Eddie', 'would', 'propose', 'again', 'end', 'next', 'season.Craig', 'Pomeroy', 'would', 'be', 'written', 'show', 'altogether', 'One', 'can', 'assume', 'show', 'actually', 'good', 'first', 'season', 'went', 'playmate', 'crazy', 'only', 'season', ""'m"", 'interested', 'purchasing', 'Baywatch', 'began', 'ended', 'first', 'season']",Baywatch - Season 1
1002071,A26A8T38C2GQD7,B000GDH8J2,Taheen Lopez,"[1, 1]","This 1991-92 Season was okay and probably the best season of the revived BAYWATCH series since this season at least had Shawni(Erika Elenaik) and Eddie(Billy Warlock)from DAYS OF OUR LIVES & GENERAL HOSPITAL, but when Eddie and Shawni departed in the 1992-93 Season, this show seemed to have gradually lost its touch and was starting to become less and less interesting and more and more overrated along with the fact that this season didn't even have Craig Pomeroy(Parker Stevenson)from THE HARDY BOYS either.Therefore this First Season DVD was only the 1st Season from the resurrected series of BAYWATCH that had returned in syndication after it tanked the 1st time since NBC had cancelled this show all of the sudden when this show took a huge tumble in the ratings in the Spring of 1990 after Jill Reilly(Shawn Weatherly)had died off due to Shawn Weatherly getting laid off from the show in March of 1990.Now I realize that BAYWATCH was actually overrated all along when it was shown in syndication throughout its whole 10-year run and that the only real reason that kept this show running for so long was the female co-stars in their bathing suits and the girls in bikinis which was making this show become more like a tit show afterwhile since numerous guys used to tune in to watch this show every week just to watch sexy women run around in their underwear on the beach and basically nothing more, which was another thing that kept the ratings on this show up for so long and another thing that made this show the so-called most popular TV show in the world back then, but now I cant even stand this show anymore since I now realize it was overrated and that this show seemed to have become phonier and phonier and more and more unrealistic every year, especially since this show was running out of steam in the last 3 seasons which prompted David Hasselhoff(Mitch)to leave BAYWATCH since this show was no longer going in the right direction since more and more co-stars kept dying off one by one in the last few seasons, including Mitch and Lt. Stephanie Holden(Alexandra Paul), plus everybody on BAYWATCH was obviously getting tired too since all the co-stars were getting burned out on this show, especially David Hasselhoff especially since BAYWATCH had lasted way too long overstaying its welcome resulting in a big sink in ratings, especially after David Hasselhoff's departure from the show.In addition; it seems like BAYWATCH has K.O.'d David Hasselhoff's acting career too since David Hasselhoff's showbiz career has gone downhill immensely since BAYWATCH cancelled for the 2nd time.No wonder this BAYWATCH DVD season 1 box set has been discontinued and no wonder most of the BAYWATCH DVD seasons are being discontinued by its manufacturer.",2,Overrated & not the actual 1st Season,1249776000,"08 9, 2009",2009,2757,"['1991-92', 'Season', 'was', 'okay', 'probably', 'best', 'season', 'revived', 'BAYWATCH', 'series', 'season', 'least', 'had', 'Shawni', 'Erika', 'Elenaik', 'Eddie', 'Billy', 'Warlock', 'DAYS', 'OF', 'OUR', 'LIVES', 'GENERAL', 'HOSPITAL', 'when', 'Eddie', 'Shawni', 'departed', '1992-93', 'Season', 'show', 'seemed', 'have', 'gradually', 'lost', 'touch', 'was', 'starting', 'become', 'less', 'less', 'interesting', 'more', 'more', 'overrated', 'fact', 'season', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'have', 'Craig', 'Pomeroy', 'Parker', 'Stevenson', 'THE', 'HARDY', 'BOYS', 'either.Therefore', 'First', 'Season', 'DVD', 'was', 'only', '1st', 'Season', 'resurrected', 'series', 'BAYWATCH', 'had', 'returned', 'syndication', 'tanked', '1st', 'time', 'NBC', 'had', 'cancelled', 'show', 'sudden', 'when', 'show', 'took', 'huge', 'tumble', 'ratings', 'Spring', '1990', 'Jill', 'Reilly', 'Shawn', 'Weatherly', 'had', 'died', 'off', 'due', 'Shawn', 'Weatherly', 'getting', 'laid', 'show', 'March', '1990.Now', 'realize', 'BAYWATCH', 'was', 'actually', 'overrated', 'when', 'was', 'shown', 'syndication', 'whole', '10-year', 'run', 'only', 'real', 'reason', 'kept', 'show', 'running', 'so', 'long', 'was', 'female', 'co-stars', 'bathing', 'suits', 'girls', 'bikinis', 'was', 'making', 'show', 'more', 'tit', 'show', 'numerous', 'guys', 'used', 'tune', 'watch', 'show', 'week', 'just', 'watch', 'sexy', 'women', 'run', 'around', 'underwear', 'beach', 'basically', 'nothing', 'more', 'was', 'thing', 'kept', 'ratings', 'show', 'up', 'so', 'long', 'thing', 'made', 'show', 'so-called', 'most', 'popular', 'TV', 'show', 'world', 'back', 'then', 'now', 'cant', 'even', 'stand', 'show', 'anymore', 'now', 'realize', 'was', 'overrated', 'show', 'seemed', 'have', 'become', 'phonier', 'phonier', 'more', 'more', 'unrealistic', 'year', 'especially', 'show', 'was', 'running', 'out', 'steam', 'last', '3', 'seasons', 'prompted', 'David', 'Hasselhoff', 'Mitch', 'leave', 'BAYWATCH', 'show', 'was', 'no', 'longer', 'going', 'right', 'direction', 'more', 'more', 'co-stars', 'kept', 'dying', 'off', 'one', 'one', 'last', 'few', 'seasons', 'including', 'Mitch', 'Lt.', 'Stephanie', 'Holden', 'Alexandra', 'Paul', 'everybody', 'BAYWATCH', 'was', 'obviously', 'getting', 'tired', 'too', 'co-stars', 'were', 'getting', 'burned', 'out', 'show', 'especially', 'David', 'Hasselhoff', 'especially', 'BAYWATCH', 'had', 'lasted', 'way', 'too', 'long', 'overstaying', 'welcome', 'resulting', 'big', 'sink', 'ratings', 'especially', 'David', 'Hasselhoff', 'departure', 'show.In', 'addition', 'BAYWATCH', 'K.O', ""'d"", 'David', 'Hasselhoff', 'acting', 'career', 'too', 'David', 'Hasselhoff', 'showbiz', 'career', 'gone', 'downhill', 'immensely', 'BAYWATCH', 'cancelled', '2nd', 'time.No', 'wonder', 'BAYWATCH', 'DVD', 'season', '1', 'box', 'set', 'been', 'discontinued', 'wonder', 'most', 'BAYWATCH', 'DVD', 'seasons', 'are', 'being', 'discontinued', 'manufacturer']",Baywatch - Season 1
