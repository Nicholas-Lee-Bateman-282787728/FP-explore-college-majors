Bet you never heard that tale, did you?This volume, billed ""The BEST of Mr. Peabody and Sherman Volume 1"" contains 15 of the roughly five minute features, with luminaries like, Napolean, Cleopatra, Ben Franklin, and others.  The puns come thick and fast, but the last bad pun for the closer is guaranteed to be a groaner.This is a must see for the younger generation, to see what their parents and grandparents grew up on, long before Bart and Homer Simspson tried to corner the market on smart ass comments.A reasonable value on it's own, an extra feature of the Bullwinkle live puppet intros that were featured during the first season are included.Though this DVD doesn't show anything more than the basic Mr. Peabody and Sherman, it is a good item to have or share.  Perhaps another DVD that contains a sample complete show might give more of the overall flavor, but this isn't bad.My kids were appalled, but sat through the entire DVD with mom and dad and we laughed again at the bad puns and simple animation.

897422,A2EUUOMCZO9TSS,B00080ZFZ2,Tim Drain,"[0, 0]","Oh, God. I've just let everybody know how old I am! Once upon a time, when the world made sense(at least to me) there was a cartoon called Rockey and Friends, featuring Rocket(hence Rocky) J. Squirrell and his best friend, Bullwinkle T. Moose. They  had an arch enemy named Boris Badenov and his girlfriend, Natasha. You younger pups may have seen an extremely forgettable movie featuring them. It was so bad and forgettable that, thankfully, I forgot the name of the movie. Rocky's friends included Dudley Doright of the Royal Canadian Mounties and his girlfriend Nell, Aesop's fables, Fractured Fairy Tales and our above featured duo, Mr. Peabody & Sherman. Mr. Peabody was obviously a dog, albeit a genius, who had adopted a young boy named Sherman from an orphange. As he put it, &#34;If every boy should have a dog, it was only logical that every dog should have a boy.&#34; Mr. Peabody had invented the Wayback Machine which allowed he and Sherman to enter a date, step into the Wayback Machine, and immediately be transported back in time to that date. These trips usually came about because Sherman was a bright and inquisitive boy and wanted to know the story behind whatever had occured on that date. Nine times out of nine, Mr. Peabody had to intervene because somone was about to do something stupid, which would have altered what we now know was the course of history as it was supposed to have happened. At the end of every story, when Mr. Peabody had set the course of history straight, he offered up to Sherman an excellent lesson punctuated by an equally excellent pun. The show was great for many reasons, not the least of which was it taught kids history. The history may have been somewhat skewed in the telling but, in the end, it made history interesting for kids and also taught them the meaning of satire! You'll notice that Amazon also offers all of the affiliated Rocky shows in their catalog. If you enjoy this series, do yourself a favor and look up the Pogo series. Pogo was a possum in the swamps of the Okeefenokee and featured one of the most intriguing set of characters you will ever meet.  There was Howlan Owl, Albert the Alligator, Churchy LaFemme(get it?) the turtle, 'Lil Pup Dog, and many others. The strip was written by Walt Kelly, one of the greatest cartoonists and philosophers who ever lived. He was one of the first major cartoonists to lampoon public politicians, from George Wallace, J. Edgar Hoover, Spiro Agnew, Tricky Dick Nixon, and a host of others. He was fearless in his visual portrayals of them and his unabashed opinion of the cultural times. You will not only enjoy all of the shenanigans of the denizens of the swamp, but it's also a real hoot to try to recognize all the public figures. He took on the KKK, whom he referred to as the Kluck Klams, and no nut fringe group or individual was left unscathed. I know I say it a lot but, THANK YOU AMAZON for making these incredibly historical and important glimpses into another time available to us. I hope you enjoy all of these collections and take great personal pride that you can actually understand the difference between them and the garbage that our children watch today that are passed off as cartoons.I'm sorry, I forgot that what our kids watch today really ARE cartoons aimed at &#34;the great unwashed&#34; who wouldn't be able to comprehend the afore mentioned works of art. I wish I could take credit for the  term &#34;the great unwashed&#34;, but I can't remember where I heard it, So instead of suing me for plagerism, take gratification in the fact that I liked it enough to steal it! I'll leave plagerism to a certain current politician(we all KNOW who you are!) At least, he doesn't mangle the language like another of his cohorts, W, did. THANKS- Tim Drain.
