Paul Carlock, Jr. ""filmfanatic""","[2, 2]","Taming Andrew is a must see for anyone interested in child development and the consequences of the lack of guidance by a loving and responsive parent/guardian.  The plot acurately portrays what took place in real life when andrew is kidnapped by his criminal father at an early age and returned about age eight.  Andrew has had neither love or parenting during his captivity.  It is now up to mother, who loves him very much, to make up for the lost socialization and bonding processes that are essential in those early years.  Highly Recommended, without any reservation!!!",5,Taming Andrew is awesome entertainment and information.,1165968000,"12 13, 2006",2006,574,"['Taming', 'Andrew', 'must', 'see', 'anyone', 'interested', 'child', 'development', 'consequences', 'lack', 'guidance', 'loving', 'responsive', 'parent/guardian', 'plot', 'acurately', 'what', 'took', 'place', 'real', 'life', 'when', 'andrew', 'kidnapped', 'criminal', 'father', 'early', 'age', 'returned', 'age', 'eight', 'Andrew', 'had', 'neither', 'love', 'parenting', 'captivity', 'now', 'up', 'mother', 'who', 'very', 'much', 'make', 'up', 'lost', 'socialization', 'bonding', 'processes', 'are', 'essential', 'early', 'years', 'Highly', 'Recommended', 'reservation']",N/A

Seth Adkins (First Do No Harm, Funky Monkey), portrays Andrew Carlson.Gail lets her ex-husband, Ted and teenage girlfriend have Andrew for the weekend. Ted doesn't return the child as promised that evening. Agonized and stressed out, Gail and her new husband, Eddie await Andrew's arrival. However, he doesn't get back until 5 years later.Andrew is not the same child he was. He has severe emotional problems brought on by the abuse at the hands of his real father. Gail goes to a child psychologist to get help.Social Services is called in and and the representative wants Andrew put into a special on-campus school for disturbed and handicapped children. Gail refuses to go along with this. She does not want to lose her son again. Gail takes Andrew out of regular school where he is teased and ignored by the other kids.She teaches Andrew at home and on her brother Jack's farm. At the farm, Andrew loves the animals but is bored with having to do homework. At the end of the movie, Andrew finally reveals to Gail the bad things his father and girlfriend did to him.Gripping and very emotional performances. Seth Adkins is great here. A talented young actor has done even more feature films and TV shows.You'll need a box of kleenex while watching this sad but overwhelmingly thought-provoking movie.",5,Taming Andrew,1177372800,"04 24, 2007",2007,1425,"['movie', 'wonderful', 'yet', 'heartbreaking', 'Park', 'Overall', 'Empty', 'Nest', 'Gail', 'Carlson', 'devoted', 'loving', 'mother', 'Seth', 'Adkins', 'First', 'Do', 'No', 'Harm', 'Funky', 'Monkey', 'Andrew', 'Carlson.Gail', 'ex-husband', 'Ted', 'teenage', 'girlfriend', 'have', 'Andrew', 'weekend', 'Ted', ""n't"", 'return', 'child', 'promised', 'evening', 'Agonized', 'stressed', 'out', 'Gail', 'new', 'husband', 'Eddie', 'await', 'Andrew', 'arrival', 'However', ""n't"", 'get', 'back', '5', 'years', 'later.Andrew', 'not', 'same', 'child', 'was', 'severe', 'emotional', 'problems', 'brought', 'abuse', 'hands', 'real', 'father', 'Gail', 'child', 'psychologist', 'get', 'help.Social', 'Services', 'called', 'representative', 'Andrew', 'put', 'special', 'on-campus', 'school', 'disturbed', 'handicapped', 'children', 'Gail', 'go', 'along', 'not', 'want', 'lose', 'son', 'again', 'Gail', 'Andrew', 'regular', 'school', 'where', 'teased', 'ignored', 'other', 'kids.She', 'teaches', 'Andrew', 'home', 'brother', 'Jack', 'farm', 'farm', 'Andrew', 'animals', 'bored', 'having', 'do', 'homework', 'end', 'movie', 'Andrew', 'finally', 'Gail', 'bad', 'things', 'father', 'girlfriend', 'did', 'him.Gripping', 'very', 'emotional', 'performances', 'Seth', 'Adkins', 'great', 'here', 'A', 'talented', 'young', 'actor', 'done', 'even', 'more', 'feature', 'films', 'TV', 'shows.You', ""'ll"", 'need', 'box', 'kleenex', 'watching', 'sad', 'overwhelmingly', 'thought-provoking', 'movie']",N/A
770327,A3EPH0HLPI98T3,B0000B1OEK,Jakey,"[5, 9]","The sole reason for watching this film is an incredible acting performance from 10-year-old Seth Adkins.  If it weren't for his abilities as an actor, this film would be a complete waste of time.The adult roles in this film, particularily that of Park Overall, were a complete disappointment.  When she tells her toddler that he's a ""silly boy"", I could almost hear her reading the script out loud.  The same occurs when she asks her child's doctor if he can help her..... after countless visits.  Perhaps this can be blamed to poor screenwriting, but the actress performing in this role did not improve in the film's weaknesses.Moreover, the teleplay includes dialogue from Andrew at age 3 or 4, saying words and phrases that no child that age would ever say.The first twenty minutes or so of this tv-production is filled with horrendous acting.... yet the amazing performance by young Seth Adkins in the latter portion of this film does indeed salvage the movie to a ""viewable"" standard.I hope this young actor is successful in his career, and can make the difficult transition to an adult actor.It is a made-for-television movie, so perhaps my expectations are a bit high.  I'd recommend this film for a one-time viewing, but would never wish to own the film as a part of my dvd collection.",3,TV movie on dvd,1123632000,"08 10, 2005",2005,1293,"['sole', 'reason', 'watching', 'film', 'incredible', 'acting', 'performance', '10-year-old', 'Seth', 'Adkins', 'were', ""n't"", 'abilities', 'actor', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'complete', 'waste', 'time.The', 'adult', 'roles', 'film', 'particularily', 'Park', 'Overall', 'were', 'complete', 'disappointment', 'When', 'toddler', 'silly', 'boy', 'could', 'almost', 'hear', 'reading', 'script', 'out', 'loud', 'same', 'occurs', 'when', 'child', 'doctor', 'can', 'help', '..', 'countless', 'visits', 'Perhaps', 'can', 'be', 'blamed', 'poor', 'screenwriting', 'actress', 'performing', 'role', 'did', 'not', 'improve', 'film', 'weaknesses.Moreover', 'teleplay', 'dialogue', 'Andrew', 'age', '3', '4', 'saying', 'words', 'phrases', 'child', 'age', 'would', 'ever', 'say.The', 'first', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'so', 'tv-production', 'filled', 'horrendous', 'acting', 'amazing', 'performance', 'young', 'Seth', 'Adkins', 'latter', 'portion', 'film', 'indeed', 'salvage', 'movie', 'viewable', 'standard.I', 'hope', 'young', 'actor', 'successful', 'career', 'can', 'make', 'difficult', 'transition', 'adult', 'actor.It', 'made-for-television', 'movie', 'so', 'perhaps', 'expectations', 'are', 'bit', 'high', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'film', 'one-time', 'viewing', 'would', 'never', 'wish', 'own', 'film', 'part', 'dvd', 'collection']",N/A

The resulting psychological damage is almost irreversible.
