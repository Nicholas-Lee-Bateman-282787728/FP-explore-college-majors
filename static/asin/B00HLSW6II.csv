1690039,A3MOYMEB2XOOC1,B00HLSW6II,"Amazon Customer ""ROCKN IN SO CAL""","[0, 0]","My wife and I watched this film on opening weekend.  My wife knows nothing about football and she liked the film.  I am a former Cleveland resident who followed the Browns in High School until moving back to the west coast.  I follow the NFL draft every year with all of it's human drama.  Originally the script was about the Buffalo Bills, for tax reasons the film was shifted to Cleveland.  Any person who is a football fan die hard will like this film.  Each draft brings hope to a losing ball club, optimism runs high for the fans.On the center stage is the G.M. played by Kevin Costner.  A man trying to show grace under pressure, turning around a losing franchise.  Screaming in one ear is the owner, screaming in his other ear is the head coach played by Dennis Leary.  Sonny Weaver must balance their demands on draft day.  Or does he do what he feels is the right move for the club?  Calming the storm is Jennifer Garner, the cap room specialist, crunching the contracts to make room for new players.  She is the go between to insulate Costner from the head coach's demands on D- Day.  The clock is ticking down till Cleveland picks.At the eye of the storm is the new intern who sees it all, working the phones, watching the tension come and go with each hour till the Browns are on the clock.  Running errands near the war room, coaches yelling, the G.M. yelling back, taking messages; the intern is the barometer for the whirl wind of emotions at crunch time.  The owner wants a player who will bring in the fans, G.M. Weaver wants the right player who will impact the club on defense or offense.  The coach only thinks offense since that's what he knows.  The fans want a quarterback to take them to a Super Bowl.  Director Ivan Reitman does a good job with the back stories behind the draft, building to their pick in New York City.",4,My wife knows nothing about football and she liked the film,1405728000,"07 19, 2014",2014,1845,"['wife', 'watched', 'film', 'opening', 'weekend', 'wife', 'nothing', 'football', 'liked', 'film', 'am', 'former', 'Cleveland', 'resident', 'who', 'followed', 'Browns', 'High', 'School', 'moving', 'back', 'west', 'coast', 'follow', 'NFL', 'draft', 'year', 'human', 'drama', 'Originally', 'script', 'was', 'Buffalo', 'Bills', 'tax', 'reasons', 'film', 'was', 'shifted', 'Cleveland', 'Any', 'person', 'who', 'football', 'fan', 'die', 'hard', 'will', 'like', 'film', 'draft', 'hope', 'losing', 'ball', 'club', 'optimism', 'runs', 'high', 'fans.On', 'center', 'stage', 'G.M', 'played', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'man', 'trying', 'show', 'grace', 'pressure', 'turning', 'around', 'losing', 'franchise', 'Screaming', 'one', 'ear', 'owner', 'screaming', 'other', 'ear', 'head', 'coach', 'played', 'Dennis', 'Leary', 'Sonny', 'Weaver', 'must', 'balance', 'demands', 'draft', 'day', 'do', 'what', 'right', 'move', 'club', 'Calming', 'storm', 'Jennifer', 'Garner', 'cap', 'room', 'specialist', 'crunching', 'contracts', 'make', 'room', 'new', 'players', 'go', 'insulate', 'Costner', 'head', 'coach', 'demands', 'D-', 'Day', 'clock', 'ticking', 'down', 'till', 'Cleveland', 'eye', 'storm', 'new', 'intern', 'who', 'working', 'phones', 'watching', 'tension', 'come', 'go', 'hour', 'Browns', 'are', 'clock', 'Running', 'errands', 'war', 'room', 'coaches', 'yelling', 'G.M', 'yelling', 'back', 'taking', 'messages', 'intern', 'barometer', 'whirl', 'wind', 'emotions', 'crunch', 'time', 'owner', 'player', 'who', 'will', 'bring', 'fans', 'G.M', 'right', 'player', 'who', 'will', 'impact', 'club', 'defense', 'offense', 'coach', 'only', 'offense', 'what', 'fans', 'want', 'quarterback', 'take', 'Super', 'Bowl', 'Director', 'Ivan', 'Reitman', 'good', 'job', 'back', 'stories', 'draft', 'building', 'pick', 'New', 'York', 'City']",N/A

I've liked Costner in just about everything I've seen him in, starting in his younger days, e.g., The Untouchables, Silverado.  He has admittedly had some ups and downs with his films, but I still wanted to see this one.I have to say in full disclosure that I went with fairly low expectations, but hopeful nevertheless, since this had a Moneyball-esque feel to it and I LOVED that film.Costner plays the GM of the Cleveland Browns in a hopeful bid to turn that team into a winner, using the NFL draft to do that.  He is faced with having to choose between his own conscience and virtually everyone else's when they have the chance to take the overall #1 pick in the draft.BTW, this is a football movie with very little football, just like Moneyball was a baseball movie with very little baseball.  Much of the drama and action occurs during phone calls between GMs trying to make deals as the draft approaches, and even while it is underway.  This could have been a major downfall for this film, but the cinematography kept it interactive.  I thought the blurring of lines between callers where they often entered and even passed through each other's real space was highly creative.I thought the main storyline was engaging, and IMO the love interest side story was a distraction rather than an addition.My major complaint, though, was that this was not a true story or even purported to be loosely based on one.  True stories tend to make the best sports movies.  After all, there are so many of them that are worth telling that there's little need to go completely fictional.  Even so, I'll award this film 4 solid stars.The acting was good, and I still feel for the poor intern.",4,Costner in Draft Day is not just an NFL version of Moneyball,1401235200,"05 28, 2014",2014,1754,"['knew', 'wanted', 'see', 'Draft', 'Day', 'saw', 'first', 'teaser', 'trailer', ""'ve"", 'liked', 'Costner', 'just', 'everything', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'starting', 'younger', 'days', 'e.g.', 'Untouchables', 'Silverado', 'admittedly', 'had', 'ups', 'downs', 'films', 'still', 'wanted', 'see', 'one.I', 'have', 'say', 'full', 'disclosure', 'went', 'fairly', 'low', 'expectations', 'hopeful', 'nevertheless', 'had', 'Moneyball-esque', 'feel', 'LOVED', 'film.Costner', 'GM', 'Cleveland', 'Browns', 'hopeful', 'bid', 'turn', 'team', 'winner', 'using', 'NFL', 'draft', 'do', 'faced', 'having', 'choose', 'own', 'conscience', 'virtually', 'everyone', 'else', 'when', 'have', 'chance', 'take', 'overall', '1', 'pick', 'draft.BTW', 'football', 'movie', 'very', 'little', 'football', 'just', 'Moneyball', 'was', 'baseball', 'movie', 'very', 'little', 'baseball', 'Much', 'drama', 'action', 'occurs', 'phone', 'calls', 'GMs', 'trying', 'make', 'deals', 'draft', 'approaches', 'even', 'underway', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'major', 'downfall', 'film', 'cinematography', 'kept', 'interactive', 'thought', 'blurring', 'lines', 'callers', 'where', 'often', 'entered', 'even', 'passed', 'other', 'real', 'space', 'was', 'highly', 'creative.I', 'thought', 'main', 'storyline', 'was', 'engaging', 'IMO', 'love', 'interest', 'side', 'story', 'was', 'distraction', 'rather', 'addition.My', 'major', 'complaint', 'was', 'was', 'not', 'true', 'story', 'even', 'purported', 'be', 'loosely', 'based', 'one', 'True', 'stories', 'tend', 'make', 'best', 'sports', 'movies', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'are', 'worth', 'telling', 'little', 'need', 'go', 'completely', 'fictional', 'Even', 'so', ""'ll"", 'award', 'film', '4', 'solid', 'stars.The', 'acting', 'was', 'good', 'still', 'feel', 'poor', 'intern']",N/A

1690042,A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ,B00HLSW6II,Chris Kennison,"[4, 8]","In 2011 the movie ""Moneyball"" came to the movie theaters starring Brad Pitt. It was a movie about the behind the scenes wheeling and dealings of Major League Baseball. The quality writing was a huge part of why a movie about something seemingly so boring made an entertaining two-hour big screen movie. Without question, ""Draft Day"" was trying to follow in the footsteps of ""Moneyball"" as it is similar in nature.The countdown clock for the 2014 NFL draft begins as the movie begins and Kevin Costner plays fictional Cleveland Browns General Manager, Sonny Weaver Jr.; a man saddled with making the right choices, one at a time in the cut-throat arena of NFL football. His thought process about the players he needs for the upcoming season begins early and the influences around him to stray from that are plenty. A note to himself on a green piece of paper as he drinks his morning coffee and slips into his pants pocket becomes an intriguing mystery until the ending.""Draft Day"" is a little more skillful than ""Moneyball"" at making the movie accessible to those who know nothing about football, but it may have been too simplistic. In order not to lose the interest of those who are novices on the ins and outs of football, they spread a thin layer of confusion. There are just three players introduced throughout the film and ultimately you just have to guess how those three players are going to play into the draft, making things somewhat predictable.The movie is well done and I have to admit it was sort of fun watching Sonny Weaver wheel, deal and try to work his way around the influences that were keeping him from drafting the team he wanted. I also found it extremely refreshing to see a General Manager probe the character of a top prospect over his obvious skills. Those moments were brilliantly done. I also have to admit that I got a little choked up at one point. Although its sort of hard to get too worked up about a person who was concerned about the difference in money he would receive as a #7 pick or a second round pick. Unfortunately though, that is probably pretty realistic in this over-payed spoiled-brat athlete culture we live in.""Draft Day"" is a fine movie that managed to juggle its elements with a little too much ease. It would have been nice to introduce a few more players to make things a little less predictable. That is hands down the number one thing that is wrong with the movie, but that is a big one. There are a whole lot of things about the film that were rewarding, interesting and entertaining, but a little more smoke and mirrors would have been nice. NFL teams don't have to just think about two or three players during the draft, they have to think about all of them and that didn't come across. Because of this, ""Draft Day"" is not a fair assessment of NFL Draft Day, it's just a hollywoodized movie about it.",3,NOT ENOUGH PLAYERS INTRODUCED means TOO PREDICTABLE,1397433600,"04 14, 2014",2014,2859,"['2011', 'movie', 'Moneyball', 'came', 'movie', 'theaters', 'starring', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'was', 'movie', 'scenes', 'wheeling', 'dealings', 'Major', 'League', 'Baseball', 'quality', 'writing', 'was', 'huge', 'part', 'why', 'movie', 'something', 'seemingly', 'so', 'boring', 'made', 'entertaining', 'two-hour', 'big', 'screen', 'movie', 'question', 'Draft', 'Day', 'was', 'trying', 'follow', 'footsteps', 'Moneyball', 'similar', 'nature.The', 'countdown', 'clock', '2014', 'NFL', 'draft', 'movie', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'fictional', 'Cleveland', 'Browns', 'General', 'Manager', 'Sonny', 'Weaver', 'Jr.', 'man', 'saddled', 'making', 'right', 'choices', 'one', 'time', 'cut-throat', 'arena', 'NFL', 'football', 'thought', 'process', 'players', 'upcoming', 'season', 'early', 'influences', 'stray', 'are', 'plenty', 'note', 'green', 'piece', 'paper', 'morning', 'coffee', 'slips', 'pants', 'pocket', 'intriguing', 'mystery', 'ending', 'Draft', 'Day', 'little', 'more', 'skillful', 'Moneyball', 'making', 'movie', 'accessible', 'who', 'know', 'nothing', 'football', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'too', 'simplistic', 'order', 'not', 'lose', 'interest', 'who', 'are', 'novices', 'ins', 'outs', 'football', 'spread', 'thin', 'layer', 'confusion', 'are', 'just', 'three', 'players', 'introduced', 'film', 'ultimately', 'just', 'have', 'guess', 'how', 'three', 'players', 'are', 'going', 'play', 'draft', 'making', 'things', 'somewhat', 'predictable.The', 'movie', 'well', 'done', 'have', 'admit', 'was', 'sort', 'fun', 'watching', 'Sonny', 'Weaver', 'wheel', 'deal', 'try', 'work', 'way', 'influences', 'were', 'keeping', 'drafting', 'team', 'wanted', 'also', 'found', 'extremely', 'refreshing', 'see', 'General', 'Manager', 'probe', 'character', 'top', 'prospect', 'obvious', 'skills', 'moments', 'were', 'brilliantly', 'done', 'also', 'have', 'admit', 'got', 'little', 'choked', 'up', 'one', 'point', 'sort', 'hard', 'get', 'too', 'worked', 'up', 'person', 'who', 'was', 'concerned', 'difference', 'money', 'would', 'receive', '7', 'pick', 'second', 'round', 'pick', 'Unfortunately', 'probably', 'pretty', 'realistic', 'over-payed', 'spoiled-brat', 'athlete', 'culture', 'live', 'Draft', 'Day', 'fine', 'movie', 'managed', 'juggle', 'elements', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'ease', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'introduce', 'few', 'more', 'players', 'make', 'things', 'little', 'less', 'predictable', 'down', 'number', 'one', 'thing', 'wrong', 'movie', 'big', 'one', 'are', 'whole', 'lot', 'things', 'film', 'were', 'rewarding', 'interesting', 'entertaining', 'little', 'more', 'smoke', 'mirrors', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'NFL', 'teams', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'just', 'think', 'two', 'three', 'players', 'draft', 'have', 'think', 'did', ""n't"", 'come', 'Draft', 'Day', 'not', 'fair', 'assessment', 'NFL', 'Draft', 'Day', 'just', 'hollywoodized', 'movie']",N/A

1690045,A1LYQL40IB7SBL,B00HLSW6II,FNDNreview,"[14, 17]","Sports films typically have a love/hate relationship with viewers &#8211; most never finding that honest middle ground that satisfies everyone&#8217;s wants and desires.  On one hand, you have the preposterous comedies that cap seriousness, sacrificing dramatic acting in exchange for a series of cheap laughs and feel-good moments, like Rookie of the Year, The Waterboy, and Caddyshack.  Then, there&#8217;s the beloved and devote dramas that live on in film infamy, which includes but is not limited to Rocky, The Natural, and Raging Bull.  Finally, you have Kevin Costner&#8217;s greatest hits, like Bull Durham, Field of Dreams, and For the Love of the Game.  And, even though Kevin Costner has left the baseball diamond and thrown his last fastball, he clearly has found a memorable position as the GM of an NFL franchise in Draft Day.Directed by Ivan Reitman (Ghostbusters, Kindergarden Cop), Draft Day stars Kevin Costner as Sonny Weaver Jr., the General Manager of the NFL&#8217;s Cleveland Browns franchise.  After multiple years of high hopes and shattered dreams, the Cleveland Browns find themselves at an important crossroads in regards to the team&#8217;s future &#8211; and Sonny finds himself on the hot seat (the possibility of being fired).  Still, it&#8217;s draft day and he knows the Browns need to produce a big splash to not only energize the fans, but also build a sturdy foundation of winning.Sonny&#8217;s day begins with news from his girlfriend and Browns front office salary cap manager, Ali (Jennifer Garner), that she&#8217;s pregnant.  However, Sonny obviously has other issues on his mind &#8211; like whom to select with the team&#8217;s first round pick.  His choices include a hot-tempered defenseman, Vontane Mack (Chadwick Boseman) and running back, Ray Jennings (Arian Foster).  Unclear who to select, he decides to trade the team&#8217;s first round picks for the next three years to the Seattle Seahawks, who have the number one pick in this year&#8217;s draft.The trade receives mixed reviews, but the Browns&#8217; owner, Harvey Molina (Frank Langella), applauds the move &#8211; especially since it gives them the opportunity to draft the number one NFL prospect, QB Bo Callahan (Josh Pence).  On the flip side, new Browns head coach, Vince Penn (Denis Leary) absolutely hates the trade, and believes Sonny sacrificed the team&#8217;s future for a player they don&#8217;t necessarily need.  And, with the clock ticking down to the start of the NFL draft, Sonny must figure out whom he wants to select with the first pick, while still attempting to keep everyone around him satisfied, and also deal with his current family crisis and tense relationship issues.  Tom Welling, Terry Crews, Sean Combs, and Griffin Newman also star in supporting roles.Although some will instantly compare Draft Day to Moneyball &#8211; both of which focus on a sports franchise&#8217;s general manager and the stress that comes along with the job, Draft Day maintains its own unique direction and is actually an entertaining look behind-the-scenes of an NFL front office.  It includes the unique dynamic that several franchises must balance, including the relationship between the owner, GM, and head coach &#8211; all of whom have certain directions in which they want to take the team.  And, at the same time, this film &#8211; again like Moneyball, takes the time to incorporate the critical family element and how a stressful job in the NFL impacts relationships.Kevin Coster, who will forever be linked to sports films, has been waning in relevance over the years &#8211; like numerous aging lead actors.  Still, Sonny Weaver Jr. is probably one of the more light-hearted and delightful roles that he&#8217;s portrayed since his role as Ray Kinsella in Field of Dreams.  Initially, Sonny is presented as a desperate character, which Costner conveys to viewers perfectly, yet as the film evolves so does the landscape for success.  Costner&#8217;s character makes a few incredibly questionable choices over the course of the film, though never tipping his hand &#8211; and it will keep audiences guessing about which player he plans to draft first.  So, trust me when I say, it&#8217;s worth the wait and it will nearly bring a tear to your eye.There is an abundance of shuffling and dealing on the outskirts of the primary plot from the supporting cast in an attempt to keep pace with Costner&#8217;s onscreen dominance.  For instance, while Jennifer Garner, Denis Leary, and Frank Langella each play a pivotal role in the grand scheme of things, they individually fail to fully dramatize the underlying importance of the NFL draft.  Sure, they all share their thoughts and ideas with Sonny in a variety of plot-progressive scenes &#8211; but this film badly needed at least one overpowering scene that could be pointed to and treated like &#8220;there it was&#8221; &#8211; that was the best scene in the film.  Unfortunately, that never happens, and the closest incident to it comes at the expense of the young interns laptop.The only real complaint about this film is that it doesn&#8217;t incorporate actual NFL players &#8211; at least not in the manner that Moneyball involved them.  Players like Peyton Manning and Tom Brady are still stars in the Draft Day universe, however, the Cleveland Browns are a team compiled of fictional players &#8211; which probably isn&#8217;t the worst thing since the Browns severely lack star-power now that the former face of their franchise, Trent Richardson, is no longer on the team.  However, this is a miniscule problem in the long run, and the plot progression of the fictional players is allotted the proper time to plant their seeds of worth.Overall, Draft Day takes full advantage of telling an engaging behind-the-scenes tale using the world&#8217;s most popular league as a vehicle.  From the film&#8217;s trailers, the film might appear to be one giant commercial for the NFL, but thankfully it turns out to be a well-scripted, charming experience.  Draft Day is a fun-loving popcorn flick through and through, but it&#8217;s also exactly the kind of perfectly balanced story that draws people to the movies, incorporating just enough drama, subtly placing humor in stressful situations, and fulfilling its promise to reveal a compelling mystery that will keep everyone on their toes.  For anyone that loves football or is interested in the power-play politics that that place behind the proverbial curtain, you&#8217;ll have an absolute amazing time watching this feature.GRADE:

Will they or will they not make the cut? To me, this arcane modern-day gladiatorial frenzy emphasized (AGAIN!) that this is a slave auction: The bartering, the wheeling and dealing, the false leads, the rumors and the ridiculous behavior of the fan(atic)s, compounded by the utter helplessness of the players being shuffled around.Director Ivan Reitman (&#34;No Strings Attached&#34;) takes us inside the thought processes of a team manager whose decisions will dash many players' dreams, and rejuvenate others. This PG-13 script, written by first-timer Scott Rothman and Rajit Joseph (TV), makes it all too painfully clear that millions of dollars are spent promoting this mania. I realized later that there were many humorous bits because as I related the story to someone else, I laughed often.We watch:* Kevin Costner (&#34;Man of Steel&#34;) today it isn't just the athletes who are perched on the edge; General Manager Sonny Weaver Jr. has the chance to save football for Cleveland...and his own behind!* Ellen Burstyn (&#34;Big Love&#34;) is his widowed mom (she's on Twitter), who tells him he has just traded a cow for a handful of magic beans. She picks the worst time to spread her husband's ashes.* Chadwick Boseman (&#34;42&#34;) is one of those helpless hopefuls. He has the most unusual cell phone I've ever seen....* Jennifer Garner (&#34;Dallas Buyers Club&#34;) lives and breathes football; her input is highly valued by our hero.* Dennis Leary (&#34;The Amazing Spiderman&#34;) is the team coach. He is furious during the negotiations and has posted notice he's leaving Cleveland.* Many players from the world of professional football appear as themselves, so this is Nirvana for fans of pro football.This is billed as a sports movie for people who are not fans of professional sports. I enjoyed the aerial views of the cities who have NFL teams, starting with an absolutely gorgeous one of Seattle, displaying the Space Needle and the Stadium District, with icy blue Puget Sound nestled alongside them.BTW, I still don't understand The Draft in pro sports.... but it looks a lot like poker to me!",5,Looks Like Poker to Me,1397001600,"04 9, 2014",2014,2201,"['Young', 'athletes', 'have', 'lives', 'professional', 'sports', 'forever', 'changed', 'Draft', 'Day', 'Will', 'will', 'not', 'make', 'cut', 'arcane', 'modern-day', 'gladiatorial', 'frenzy', 'emphasized', 'AGAIN', 'slave', 'auction', 'bartering', 'wheeling', 'dealing', 'false', 'leads', 'rumors', 'ridiculous', 'behavior', 'fan', 'atic', 's', 'compounded', 'utter', 'helplessness', 'players', 'being', 'shuffled', 'around.Director', 'Ivan', 'Reitman', '34', 'No', 'Strings', 'Attached', '34', 'thought', 'processes', 'team', 'manager', 'decisions', 'will', 'dash', 'many', 'players', 'dreams', 'rejuvenate', 'others', 'PG-13', 'script', 'written', 'first-timer', 'Scott', 'Rothman', 'Rajit', 'Joseph', 'TV', 'too', 'painfully', 'clear', 'millions', 'dollars', 'are', 'spent', 'promoting', 'mania', 'realized', 'later', 'were', 'many', 'humorous', 'bits', 'related', 'story', 'someone', 'else', 'laughed', 'often.We', 'watch', '*', 'Kevin', 'Costner', '34', 'Man', 'Steel', '34', 'today', ""n't"", 'just', 'athletes', 'who', 'are', 'perched', 'edge', 'General', 'Manager', 'Sonny', 'Weaver', 'Jr.', 'chance', 'save', 'football', 'Cleveland', 'own', 'behind', '*', 'Ellen', 'Burstyn', '34', 'Big', 'Love', '34', 'widowed', 'mom', 'Twitter', 'who', 'just', 'traded', 'cow', 'handful', 'magic', 'beans', 'worst', 'time', 'spread', 'husband', 'ashes', '*', 'Chadwick', 'Boseman', '34', '42', '34', 'one', 'helpless', 'hopefuls', 'most', 'unusual', 'cell', 'phone', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', '.*', 'Jennifer', 'Garner', '34', 'Dallas', 'Buyers', 'Club', '34', 'football', 'input', 'highly', 'valued', 'hero', 'Dennis', 'Leary', '34', 'Amazing', 'Spiderman', '34', 'team', 'coach', 'furious', 'negotiations', 'posted', 'leaving', 'Cleveland', '*', 'Many', 'players', 'world', 'professional', 'football', 'appear', 'so', 'Nirvana', 'fans', 'pro', 'football.This', 'billed', 'sports', 'movie', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'fans', 'professional', 'sports', 'enjoyed', 'aerial', 'views', 'cities', 'who', 'have', 'NFL', 'teams', 'starting', 'absolutely', 'gorgeous', 'one', 'Seattle', 'displaying', 'Space', 'Needle', 'Stadium', 'District', 'icy', 'blue', 'Puget', 'Sound', 'nestled', 'alongside', 'them.BTW', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'Draft', 'pro', 'sports', 'lot', 'poker']",N/A
1690048,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,B00HLSW6II,M. Oleson,"[1, 5]","Theatrical review.  There may be spoilers.Kevin Costner is always good in sports themed movies.  This is no exception.  He plays Sonny Weaver, Jr., the general manager of the Cleveland Browns, two years on the job.  The Browns are terrible and Weaver is best known for firing the head coach after the previous season.  Oh, and that coach was his dad, who recently died.Draft day is here and the film spends a lot of time showing the scrambling that goes on in the ""war room"" trying to make the right choices.  The Browns have the 7th pick in the draft.  The owner (Frank Langella) encourages Sonny to make a big splash.  So Sonny trades for the number one pick by giving away his first round pick this year and the next two.  That would be considered dumb or desperate.  Still, the anticipated number 1 pick is a Heisman winning quarterback from Wisconsin, considered a ""can't miss.""  Sonny, having second thoughts digs a little deeper into the QB's background and has to contend with the new head coach (Dennis Leary) who thinks the current QB (coming off an injury) is just fine and wants a running back.Helping move the film along (takes place in real time more or less) are interactions with his girlfriend nicely played by Jennifer Garner.  The two actors have a very real grown up chemistry.  I liked them together.  Also with little screen time, Ellen Burstyn shows her acting chops as Sonny's mother.  She steals her scenes.  I consider myself a fan of the NFL but I'm no insider.  I found the lingo used pretty easy to follow.  The only objection I have with the film is that I could see what Sonny was trying to do early on.  Even though I was right, it was fun to see the outwardly calm Sonny maneuver through the final act like a Hall of Fame running back.

1690049,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00HLSW6II,Roland E. Zwick,"[1, 5]","Hollywood's Mr. Baseball, aka Kevin Costner, walks off the diamond and onto the gridiron (or, more accurately, into pro football's corporate offices) in ""Draft Day,"" Ivan Reitman's entertaining tribute to the wheeling-and-dealing that goes on behind the scenes at the NFL draft.Costner plays the fictional Sonny Wheeler, Jr., son of the equally fictitious Sonny Wheeler, Sr., who has recently died and in whose shadow Sonny perpetually toils. You see, Wheeler, Sr. was a legend at the Cleveland Browns franchise, and, in his two years as general manager for the team, his son seems to be having a little trouble living up to the old man's reputation. To further complicate Sonny's life, his ""down low"" girlfriend, Ali (Jennifer Garner), who works as the lawyer responsible for making sure the team doesn't bust through the salary cap, has just announced that she is pregnant with the commitment-phobic Sonny's child. Amid all this personal turmoil, Sonny launches into full negotiator mode, making deals and forming alliances with other general managers in the league while working to assuage the concerns of the team's owner (Frank Langella), its coach (Dennis Leary), an assortment of high strung and disgruntled players (Tom Welling, Chadwick Boseman, Arian Foster) and even his own mother (Ellen Burstyn) who has views of her own that need to be taken into consideration before he can arrive at his final decision.Although it probably helps to have some familiarity with how the draft pick works in order to fully appreciate some of the finer points of the narrative, writers Rajiv Joseph and Scott Rothman do a good job clarifying the big picture even for the less sport-oriented members of the audience. The movie proceeds at a breakneck pace as the clock ticks down to the moment of truth for Sonny. Will he accept the Seattle Seahawks' offer of the #1 draft pick, Bo Callahan (Josh Pence), in exchange for the Browns' #1 first-round draft picks for the next three years, or will he reject the offer in favor of some less stellar but still promising players? ""Draft Day"" is at its best when it's exploring the various and often contradictory interests - of players, coaches and owners, not to mention the millions at stake in salaries and corporate sponsorships - that those in Sonny's position must consider before rendering their final verdicts. Talk about pressure! The filmmakers establish a nice balance between the sports aspects of the tale and the personal moments between Sonny and Ali and Sonny and his mom, never allowing the latter to detract from the former. As a result, we care about the characters without losing our focus on the real reason we've come to this movie.Reitman has come up with an interesting split-screen technique that helps to weave together a story that takes place over a wide range of geographical locales simultaneously. What might have been a mere gimmick in less capable hands becomes an indispensable narrative device here.A few weeks back, while writing about ""3 Days to Kill,"" I lamented that Costner desperately needed to find some quality material worthy of his talents to work with, and he seems to have found just that in ""Draft Day."" Costner has a core of quiet stillness that lends a genuine gravitas to his performances. Because he can appear both confident and insecure in the same moment, he makes us want to root for the character he's playing. He's also blessed with a super supporting cast that includes, in addition to all the aforementioned, Terry Crews, Rosanna Arquette, Sam Elliot, and Sean Combs.""Draft Day"" proves that not all the competitiveness and excitement of professional football takes place on the field.",4,First and 10,1398038400,"04 21, 2014",2014,3680,"['Hollywood', 'Mr', 'Baseball', 'aka', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'walks', 'off', 'diamond', 'gridiron', 'more', 'accurately', 'pro', 'football', 'corporate', 'offices', 'Draft', 'Day', 'Ivan', 'Reitman', 'entertaining', 'tribute', 'wheeling-and-dealing', 'scenes', 'NFL', 'draft.Costner', 'fictional', 'Sonny', 'Wheeler', 'Jr.', 'son', 'equally', 'fictitious', 'Sonny', 'Wheeler', 'Sr.', 'who', 'recently', 'died', 'shadow', 'Sonny', 'perpetually', 'see', 'Wheeler', 'Sr.', 'was', 'legend', 'Cleveland', 'Browns', 'franchise', 'two', 'years', 'general', 'manager', 'team', 'son', 'be', 'having', 'little', 'trouble', 'living', 'up', 'old', 'man', 'reputation', 'further', 'complicate', 'Sonny', 'life', 'down', 'low', 'girlfriend', 'Ali', 'Jennifer', 'Garner', 'who', 'lawyer', 'responsible', 'making', 'sure', 'team', ""n't"", 'bust', 'salary', 'cap', 'just', 'announced', 'pregnant', 'commitment-phobic', 'Sonny', 'child', 'Amid', 'personal', 'turmoil', 'Sonny', 'full', 'negotiator', 'mode', 'making', 'deals', 'forming', 'alliances', 'other', 'general', 'managers', 'league', 'working', 'assuage', 'concerns', 'team', 'owner', 'Frank', 'Langella', 'coach', 'Dennis', 'Leary', 'assortment', 'high', 'strung', 'disgruntled', 'players', 'Tom', 'Welling', 'Chadwick', 'Boseman', 'Arian', 'Foster', 'even', 'own', 'mother', 'Ellen', 'Burstyn', 'who', 'views', 'own', 'need', 'be', 'taken', 'consideration', 'can', 'arrive', 'final', 'decision.Although', 'probably', 'have', 'familiarity', 'how', 'draft', 'pick', 'order', 'fully', 'appreciate', 'finer', 'points', 'narrative', 'writers', 'Rajiv', 'Joseph', 'Scott', 'Rothman', 'do', 'good', 'job', 'clarifying', 'big', 'picture', 'even', 'less', 'sport-oriented', 'members', 'audience', 'movie', 'proceeds', 'breakneck', 'pace', 'clock', 'down', 'moment', 'truth', 'Sonny', 'Will', 'accept', 'Seattle', 'Seahawks', 'offer', '1', 'draft', 'pick', 'Bo', 'Callahan', 'Josh', 'Pence', 'exchange', 'Browns', '1', 'first-round', 'draft', 'picks', 'next', 'three', 'years', 'will', 'reject', 'offer', 'favor', 'less', 'stellar', 'still', 'promising', 'players', 'Draft', 'Day', 'best', 'when', 'exploring', 'various', 'often', 'contradictory', 'interests', 'players', 'coaches', 'owners', 'not', 'mention', 'millions', 'stake', 'salaries', 'corporate', 'sponsorships', 'Sonny', 'position', 'must', 'consider', 'rendering', 'final', 'verdicts', 'Talk', 'pressure', 'filmmakers', 'establish', 'nice', 'balance', 'sports', 'aspects', 'tale', 'personal', 'moments', 'Sonny', 'Ali', 'Sonny', 'mom', 'never', 'allowing', 'latter', 'detract', 'former', 'result', 'care', 'characters', 'losing', 'focus', 'real', 'reason', ""'ve"", 'come', 'movie.Reitman', 'come', 'up', 'interesting', 'split-screen', 'technique', 'weave', 'together', 'story', 'place', 'wide', 'range', 'geographical', 'locales', 'simultaneously', 'What', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'mere', 'gimmick', 'less', 'capable', 'hands', 'indispensable', 'narrative', 'device', 'here.A', 'few', 'weeks', 'back', 'writing', '3', 'Days', 'Kill', 'lamented', 'Costner', 'desperately', 'needed', 'find', 'quality', 'material', 'worthy', 'talents', 'work', 'have', 'found', 'just', 'Draft', 'Day', 'Costner', 'core', 'quiet', 'stillness', 'genuine', 'gravitas', 'performances', 'can', 'appear', 'confident', 'insecure', 'same', 'moment', 'want', 'root', 'character', 'playing', 'also', 'blessed', 'super', 'supporting', 'cast', 'addition', 'aforementioned', 'Terry', 'Crews', 'Rosanna', 'Arquette', 'Sam', 'Elliot', 'Sean', 'Combs', 'Draft', 'Day', 'not', 'competitiveness', 'excitement', 'professional', 'football', 'place', 'field']",N/A
