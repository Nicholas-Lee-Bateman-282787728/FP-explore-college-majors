Make sure you have done some beginners workouts so you know some of the poses already. This definitely should not be you're first workout tape. This is a well paced workout that not only works on you're flexability but your'e strength and concentration too.This has alot of downward facing dog poses in it. This seemed to help prepare me for the headstands and handstands in the Yoga Journal's Yoga for intermediates by getting me used to having my head down and blood flowing to it. Rodney Yee is a great instructor. I love how he incorporates small meditations at the end of each of his videos. I am glad I purchased this tape. It brings me 20 min. of peace and serenity  and leaves me feeling focused, energised and peaceful throughout the day.",5,"Great for flexability, focus, and strength",993859200,"06 30, 2001",2001,866,"['great', 'tape', 'are', 'somewhat', 'flexible', 'already', 'want', 'prepare', 'more', 'challenging', 'poses', 'Make', 'sure', 'have', 'done', 'beginners', 'workouts', 'so', 'know', 'poses', 'already', 'definitely', 'should', 'not', 'be', ""'re"", 'first', 'workout', 'tape', 'well', 'paced', 'workout', 'not', 'only', ""'re"", 'flexability', 'e', 'strength', 'concentration', 'too.This', 'alot', 'downward', 'facing', 'dog', 'poses', 'seemed', 'help', 'prepare', 'headstands', 'handstands', 'Yoga', 'Journal', 'Yoga', 'intermediates', 'getting', 'used', 'having', 'head', 'down', 'blood', 'flowing', 'Rodney', 'Yee', 'great', 'instructor', 'love', 'how', 'small', 'meditations', 'end', 'videos', 'am', 'glad', 'purchased', 'tape', '20', 'min', 'peace', 'serenity', 'feeling', 'focused', 'energised', 'peaceful', 'day']",Power Flexibility Yoga for Beginners with Rodney Yee Living Yoga  VHS
507227,AK7CAW3N1XZV6,B00000JPRS,"Beth Cholette ""doctor_beth""","[6, 6]","First of all, like all of the videos in the Living Arts &quot;for Beginners&quot; series, this tape assumes some prior familiarity with basic yoga poses, so &quot;Yoga Practice for Beginners&quot; is recommended as a first step.  Secondly, because this is a &quot;power&quot; yoga workout, it moves along at a fairly quick pace, so some baseline staminia and strength is also a necessary prerequisite to this practice.That being said, Rodney Yee has done a nice job of putting together a flowing, energizing 25-minute workout on this video.  I particularly like how he gradually increases the difficulty level over the course of the practice.  For example, when you first begin the sun salutations, you will step back to a lunge and put your knees on the floor before coming into cobra; on subsequent repetitions, you jump back instead and then move into a low push-up position before doing a full upward dog.  Yee gradually adds on to the sun salutations with powerful pose, warrior poses, triangle, three-legged dog, and one of my favorite poses, pigeon--this is an especially nice hip opener.  Following the standing poses, Yee comes to a seated position for simple seated forward bends:  head to knee, wide-legged forward bend, and cobbler.  Finally, Yee moves to reclined poses and offers a nice guided meditation in relaxation pose which is less rushed than in his other videos.This is my favorite video in Yee's Power Yoga series.  The practice flows at a nice, steady pace without feeling rushed, and the poses included provide excellent stretches, particularly for the hip area.  This is a good video for anyone who wants a shorter yoga practice which is invigorating without being exhausting.",4,Nicely flowing practice provides vigorous stretching,1079654400,"03 19, 2004",2004,1702,"['First', 'all', 'videos', 'Living', 'Arts', 'quot', 'Beginners', 'quot', 'series', 'tape', 'prior', 'familiarity', 'basic', 'yoga', 'poses', 'so', 'quot', 'Yoga', 'Practice', 'Beginners', 'quot', 'recommended', 'first', 'step', 'Secondly', 'quot', 'power', 'quot', 'along', 'fairly', 'quick', 'pace', 'baseline', 'staminia', 'strength', 'also', 'necessary', 'prerequisite', 'practice.That', 'being', 'said', 'Rodney', 'Yee', 'done', 'nice', 'job', 'putting', 'together', 'flowing', 'energizing', '25-minute', 'workout', 'video', 'particularly', 'how', 'gradually', 'difficulty', 'level', 'course', 'practice', 'example', 'when', 'first', 'begin', 'sun', 'salutations', 'will', 'step', 'back', 'lunge', 'put', 'knees', 'floor', 'coming', 'cobra', 'subsequent', 'repetitions', 'jump', 'back', 'instead', 'then', 'move', 'low', 'push-up', 'position', 'doing', 'full', 'upward', 'dog', 'Yee', 'gradually', 'sun', 'salutations', 'powerful', 'pose', 'warrior', 'poses', 'triangle', 'three-legged', 'dog', 'one', 'favorite', 'poses', 'pigeon', 'especially', 'nice', 'hip', 'opener', 'Following', 'standing', 'poses', 'Yee', 'seated', 'position', 'simple', 'seated', 'forward', 'bends', 'head', 'knee', 'wide-legged', 'forward', 'bend', 'cobbler', 'Finally', 'Yee', 'reclined', 'poses', 'nice', 'guided', 'meditation', 'relaxation', 'pose', 'less', 'rushed', 'other', 'videos.This', 'favorite', 'video', 'Yee', 'Power', 'Yoga', 'series', 'practice', 'nice', 'steady', 'pace', 'feeling', 'rushed', 'poses', 'included', 'provide', 'excellent', 'stretches', 'particularly', 'hip', 'area', 'good', 'video', 'anyone', 'who', 'shorter', 'yoga', 'practice', 'invigorating', 'being', 'exhausting']",Power Flexibility Yoga for Beginners with Rodney Yee Living Yoga  VHS

I've done the Yoga Zone meditation tapes, and really enjoy those, but this one even says in the beginning you will work up a sweat etc.. I can tell you this: You don't sweat because there is no exercise. It is a matter of forming your body into impossible pretzel shapes. I really think you have to be more than a beginner to do this stuff. And it seems unnatural and actually dangerous. I tried it several times, careful each time to follow the instructions to the letter, and finally decided it was a definite no for me. I am in good shape normally, so it isn't a matter of being primed for it, it's a matter of being able to contort yourself like a rubber band.",1,"If I could twist my body like that, I wouldn't need Yoga.",1038268800,"11 26, 2002",2002,739,"['Forget', 'one', 'folks', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'contortionist', 'even', 'begin', ""'ve"", 'done', 'Yoga', 'Zone', 'meditation', 'tapes', 'really', 'enjoy', 'one', 'even', 'beginning', 'will', 'work', 'up', 'sweat', 'etc..', 'can', 'tell', 'do', ""n't"", 'sweat', 'exercise', 'matter', 'forming', 'body', 'impossible', 'pretzel', 'shapes', 'really', 'think', 'have', 'be', 'more', 'beginner', 'do', 'stuff', 'unnatural', 'actually', 'dangerous', 'tried', 'several', 'times', 'careful', 'time', 'follow', 'instructions', 'letter', 'finally', 'decided', 'was', 'definite', 'am', 'good', 'shape', 'normally', ""n't"", 'matter', 'being', 'primed', 'matter', 'being', 'able', 'contort', 'rubber', 'band']",Power Flexibility Yoga for Beginners with Rodney Yee Living Yoga  VHS
