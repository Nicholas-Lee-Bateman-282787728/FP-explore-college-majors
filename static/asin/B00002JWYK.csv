514989,A1LMBOI3T91P87,B00002JWYK,Allan M. Lees,"[4, 4]","The Draughtsman's Contract was made near the very height of the post-structuralist semiotic orgy that infected France and Germany and, to a lesser extent, the intellectual circles (such as they are) of Britain. If the most famous novel resulting from that frenzied period was The Name Of The Rose and the most widely read piece of theory was S/Z, then The Draughtsman's Contract was the most elegant and popular film.  But just as Rose and S/Z were ultimately less substantial than their progenitors tried to claim, so is this movie less than meets the eye.  For all Greenaway's insistence on semiotic clues (the objects that appear in the twelve drawings the eponymous Mr Neville is contracted to produce), the fact is that this is a beautiful work that is essentially hollow at the core.  But frankly it doesn't matter.  No one composes shots like Greenaway.  Each frame is constructed with the care of an Old Master.  It doesn't matter that the plot is silly and the intellectual guessing-game actually rather thin.  What carries the movie is its sense of itself.  It is assured, witty, engaging, and wonderful to look at.  Greenaway revels in the period costumes and the dialog is always brisk and amusing.  This is a movie you would be happy to watch with the volume turned off, were it not for the score which is glorious in itself - a twentieth century interpretation of period composers like Purcell.The plot of the movie has been recapitulated by other reviewers; suffice it to say that really the plot doesn't matter except that it acts as a scaffold for Greenaway's compositions.  This is essentially a static movie, a movie in individual frames each of which is to be savoured. It doesn't matter ""what Greenaway meant"" because in the end the whole post-structuralist theory meant practically nothing.  But whereas post-structuralist music is unlistenable and works like S/Z are now mere museum curiosities, The Draughtsman's Contract is still worth watching for the sheer visual delight it provides.",4,Vermeer meets Barthes,1233187200,"01 29, 2009",2009,2011,"['Draughtsman', 'Contract', 'was', 'made', 'very', 'height', 'post-structuralist', 'semiotic', 'orgy', 'infected', 'France', 'Germany', 'lesser', 'extent', 'intellectual', 'circles', 'such', 'are', 'Britain', 'most', 'famous', 'novel', 'resulting', 'frenzied', 'period', 'was', 'Name', 'Rose', 'most', 'widely', 'read', 'piece', 'theory', 'was', 'S/Z', 'then', 'Draughtsman', 'Contract', 'was', 'most', 'elegant', 'popular', 'film', 'just', 'Rose', 'S/Z', 'were', 'ultimately', 'less', 'substantial', 'progenitors', 'tried', 'claim', 'so', 'movie', 'less', 'eye', 'Greenaway', 'insistence', 'semiotic', 'clues', 'objects', 'appear', 'twelve', 'eponymous', 'Mr', 'Neville', 'contracted', 'produce', 'fact', 'beautiful', 'work', 'essentially', 'hollow', 'core', 'frankly', ""n't"", 'matter', 'one', 'shots', 'Greenaway', 'frame', 'constructed', 'care', 'Old', 'Master', ""n't"", 'matter', 'plot', 'silly', 'intellectual', 'guessing-game', 'actually', 'rather', 'thin', 'What', 'movie', 'sense', 'assured', 'witty', 'engaging', 'wonderful', 'look', 'Greenaway', 'revels', 'period', 'costumes', 'dialog', 'always', 'brisk', 'amusing', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'happy', 'watch', 'volume', 'turned', 'off', 'were', 'not', 'score', 'glorious', 'twentieth', 'century', 'interpretation', 'period', 'composers', 'Purcell.The', 'plot', 'movie', 'been', 'recapitulated', 'other', 'reviewers', 'suffice', 'say', 'really', 'plot', ""n't"", 'matter', 'scaffold', 'Greenaway', 'compositions', 'essentially', 'static', 'movie', 'movie', 'individual', 'frames', 'be', 'savoured', ""n't"", 'matter', 'what', 'Greenaway', 'meant', 'end', 'whole', 'post-structuralist', 'theory', 'meant', 'practically', 'nothing', 'whereas', 'post-structuralist', 'music', 'unlistenable', 'S/Z', 'are', 'now', 'mere', 'museum', 'curiosities', 'Draughtsman', 'Contract', 'still', 'worth', 'watching', 'sheer', 'visual', 'delight']",N/A

That he believes he is smarter than everyone around him will come around to be his undoing.  Being used while he thinks he is doing the using, the Draughtsman finds out too late that he has been nothing more than a pawn in a game he never understood.Not for everyone, I found the film fascinating but as detached and aloof as its protagonist.  This cold detachment becomes the wry amusement in the story, but also separates us from any emotional connection to the characters.

514992,A3N94LNED0IF0R,B00002JWYK,Charles S. Tashiro,"[15, 17]","Peter Greenaway may be the last indisputably distinctive Anglophone filmmaker. With &quot;The Draughtsman's Contract,&quot; he broke through from relative obscurity as an experimental artist into feature-length narratives. While his subsequent films have been more conservative than his earlier work, he remains a highly original and innovative artist. &quot;Contract&quot; may be his most balanced film, integrating much of his earlier formal experimentation with the demands of narrative.Greenaway is just about the only well-known filmmaker with an interest in the art and film theory of the past thirty-five years. His is a &quot;meta-cinema,&quot; at least as much about the act of making and watching movies as about particular situations. Summarizing the story of &quot;The Draughtsman's Contract,&quot; for example, gives only a limited sense of what watching the movie is like. As some of the reviews here have pointed out, you cannot watch &quot;Contract&quot; without noticing the perspective tools used by Mr. Neville. These technologies anticipate the optics used in photography and cinematography. As we are aware of how they contribute to 17th century draftsmanship we (in theory at least) recognize the construction of the very images we are viewing. In short, through these and other techniques, you are too aware of experiencing the film to become engrossed in it.If you are not comfortable with such distancing, &quot;The Draughtsman's Contract&quot; may not be your cup of tea. On the other hand, there is certainly &quot;much to be applauded&quot; in &quot;The Draughtsman's Contract.&quot; As in virtually all of Greenaway's work, the visual design and cinematography are exquisite and all the more remarkable given the film was shot in 16mm. The actors obviously relish the chance to make the film's baroque dialogue compelling, lively, believable as everyday speech. (Incidentally, fans of the British &quot;Poirot&quot; series should get a chuckle out of Hugh Fraser's snide, arch, thoroughly unpleasant Mr. Talmann. It's almost impossible to believe that under the wigs and layers of linen and between the pauses in a viscous German accent is Poirot's amiable poodle, Captain Hastings.) &quot;Contract&quot; was also as much a breakthrough for Greenaway's favorite composer, Michael Nyman, as it was for the director. The score's Purcellian themes and arrangements are a little a-typical for the composer, however.If you are familiar with the film or Greenaway's other work, you should be aware that the transfer is adequate without being stunning. While matted for widescreen, the disc is not 16:9 enhanced, which is a pity. Blown up to fill a widescreen TV, the grain gets a bit noticeable. I recommend viewing the disc in matted 4:3 mode. If you have never seen a Greenaway film, &quot;The Draughtsman's Contract&quot; makes an excellent introduction to the intricacies and paradoxes of his thematically and sensually rich cinema.",4,Games for Adults,989625600,"05 12, 2001",2001,2959,"['Peter', 'Greenaway', 'may', 'be', 'last', 'indisputably', 'distinctive', 'Anglophone', 'filmmaker', 'quot', 'Draughtsman', 'Contract', 'quot', 'broke', 'relative', 'obscurity', 'experimental', 'artist', 'feature-length', 'narratives', 'subsequent', 'films', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'conservative', 'earlier', 'work', 'highly', 'original', 'innovative', 'artist', 'quot', 'Contract', 'quot', 'may', 'be', 'most', 'balanced', 'film', 'integrating', 'much', 'earlier', 'formal', 'experimentation', 'demands', 'narrative.Greenaway', 'just', 'only', 'well-known', 'filmmaker', 'interest', 'art', 'film', 'theory', 'past', 'thirty-five', 'years', 'quot', 'meta-cinema', 'quot', 'least', 'as', 'much', 'act', 'making', 'watching', 'movies', 'particular', 'situations', 'Summarizing', 'story', 'quot', 'Draughtsman', 'Contract', 'quot', 'example', 'only', 'limited', 'sense', 'what', 'watching', 'movie', 'like', 'reviews', 'here', 'have', 'pointed', 'out', 'can', 'not', 'watch', 'quot', 'Contract', 'quot', 'noticing', 'perspective', 'tools', 'used', 'Mr.', 'Neville', 'technologies', 'anticipate', 'optics', 'used', 'photography', 'cinematography', 'are', 'aware', 'how', 'contribute', '17th', 'century', 'draftsmanship', 'theory', 'least', 'recognize', 'construction', 'very', 'are', 'viewing', 'short', 'other', 'techniques', 'are', 'too', 'aware', 'experiencing', 'film', 'become', 'engrossed', 'it.If', 'are', 'not', 'comfortable', 'such', 'distancing', 'quot', 'Draughtsman', 'Contract', 'quot', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'cup', 'tea', 'other', 'hand', 'certainly', 'quot', 'much', 'be', 'applauded', 'quot', 'quot', 'Draughtsman', 'Contract.', 'quot', 'virtually', 'Greenaway', 'work', 'visual', 'design', 'cinematography', 'are', 'exquisite', 'more', 'remarkable', 'given', 'film', 'was', 'shot', '16mm', 'actors', 'obviously', 'relish', 'chance', 'make', 'film', 'baroque', 'dialogue', 'compelling', 'lively', 'believable', 'everyday', 'speech', 'Incidentally', 'fans', 'British', 'quot', 'Poirot', 'quot', 'series', 'should', 'get', 'chuckle', 'Hugh', 'Fraser', 'snide', 'arch', 'thoroughly', 'unpleasant', 'Mr.', 'Talmann', 'almost', 'impossible', 'believe', 'wigs', 'layers', 'linen', 'pauses', 'viscous', 'German', 'accent', 'Poirot', 'amiable', 'poodle', 'Captain', 'Hastings', 'quot', 'Contract', 'quot', 'was', 'also', 'as', 'much', 'breakthrough', 'Greenaway', 'favorite', 'composer', 'Michael', 'Nyman', 'was', 'director', 'score', 'Purcellian', 'themes', 'arrangements', 'are', 'little', 'a-typical', 'composer', 'however.If', 'are', 'familiar', 'film', 'Greenaway', 'other', 'work', 'should', 'be', 'aware', 'transfer', 'adequate', 'being', 'stunning', 'matted', 'widescreen', 'disc', 'not', '16:9', 'enhanced', 'pity', 'Blown', 'up', 'fill', 'widescreen', 'TV', 'grain', 'bit', 'noticeable', 'recommend', 'viewing', 'disc', 'matted', '4:3', 'mode', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'Greenaway', 'film', 'quot', 'Draughtsman', 'Contract', 'quot', 'excellent', 'introduction', 'intricacies', 'paradoxes', 'thematically', 'sensually', 'rich', 'cinema']",N/A
514993,A2GCHG6U8HTVIT,B00002JWYK,C. O. DeRiemer,"[6, 6]","We're in post Restoration England in 1694, and at a country estate filled with condescending, witty, superficial creatures dressed in heavy satins and lace, with chalk dusted cheeks, painted cupid lips and beauty spots, and wearing magnificent high wigs with cascading curls down to the waist...and that's just the men.In their midst is Mr. Neville (Anthony Higgins), a talented, successful and arrogant artist whose father, we learn later, was a tenant farmer. He is engaged by the lady of the estate, Mrs. Herbert (Janet Suzman) to draw 12 views of the estate as a present for her clod of a husband, who will be away on business for the next 15 days. Mr. Neville declines. The unhappily married Mrs. Herbert increases his fee. Mr. Neville again declines. Mrs. Herbert offers him her intimate pleasure along with the fee. At that, Mr. Neville agrees. A contract is prepared which spells out Mr. Neville's exact requirements for the 12 views and Mrs. Herbert's contractual obligation for his pleasure. In the course of these two weeks the detailed views will be drawn, pleasure will be taken, Mrs. Herbert's daughter, Mrs. Tallman, will offer a contract of her own and we will learn a bit about heirs and impotency. The absent Mr. Herbert will return, but as a corpse discovered in the estate's moat.I have no doubt that Peter Greenaway knew exactly what he was doing with The Draughtsman's Contract. Me? I know what I think happened...probably. I like this movie immensely. Discussing the meaning behind Greenaway's films likeThe Cook, the Thief, His Wife and Her Lover, orProspero's Booksor The Draughtsman's Contract, is almost a small industry among film students and certain cineastes. A good place to start this sort of discussion, however, is not with ""Greenaway was aiming at this..."" but with ""I think Greenaway was aiming at this..."" That ""I"" language makes the speaker own his or her opinions, and almost invariably decreases the ""Izzat so?"" quotient. That's a positive. What I know is that I think The Draughtsman's Contract is a mannered, magnificent puzzle of a film, where everyone speaks in complete sentences. It's stuffed full of elegance, precision, disconcerting oddness, uncomfortable relationships, hidden motives, ego, style, art, sex, eye burning, murder and ambiguity. When this is all stirred together with Greenaway's imagination and ability to create disconcerting and beautiful visions, what more could a person want? Well, perhaps a story that moves from plot point to plot point, all clear and tidy, and with an ending that leaves us satisfied and happy. If that's so, then Greenaway is not for you. Better stick with Michael Shayne, Private Detective (another movie I like a lot).""Your significance, Mr. Neville,"" says one important character, ""is attributable to both innocence and arrogance in equal parts."" His arrogance doesn't allow more than contempt for those privileged, condescending, shallow people he now is surrounded by during these two weeks. His innocence keeps him from considering the possibilities of what he sees but doesn't see. He is a man whose lovemaking is brutally self-centered and as mannered as his conversation, with his conversation continuing during his lovemaking, ""You must forgive my curiosity, madam, and open your knees."" Even so, we begin to feel a little uncomfortable for him. Almost as important to the plot is that Mr. Neville draws exactly what he sees. But what does he see? A window that is open when it should be closed? A ladder against a wall? A jacket on a bush when there had been a sheet? A pair of riding boots? It all has a point, but some of it is pure Greenaway. What is, after all, the point of the countertenor...or of the naked statue who is not a statue...or, for that matter, of the 13th drawing? How sure are we of the significance of the three pomegranates...or the last scene where we witness a slobbering bite of pineapple? I don't know, but I enjoyed every minute of it.Janet Suzman and Anthony Higgins carry us along in great style. Almost as important are Anne-Louise Lambert as Mrs. Tallman, Mrs. Herbert's daughter, and Hugh Fraser as Mr. Tallman. The movie is gorgeous to look at, painterly in its compositions and without, in my opinion, a dull moment. All that clever, mannered dialogue sounds straight from a Restoration melodrama. The Draughtsman's Contract is a wonderful movie.The best version is the Zeitgeist DVD release. It's been carefully restored, is anamorphic and has several interesting extras, including an introduction to the film by Greenaway.",5,"""Your significance, Mr. Neville, is attributable to both innocence and arrogance in equal parts.""

The design is beautiful, with the sets and costumes serving a dull dull story, bereft of plot, characters, and interesting dialogue. Why Greenaway tried to write this himself, instead of employing a writer is beyond me. Michael Nyman makes a good stab at the music, but it is too dominant in the sound mix, and not subtle enough to complement the occasionally good photography.

You are on your own to try to figure out - everything you need to know is right there), and funny (Yes, Greenaway can be funny!) art film - the perfect example of an art film.

I know I will watch it again because it is a feast for eyes (I've seen big budget movies that looked plain comparing to this one shot on the limited funds), ears (Michael Nyman wrote one of the best score ever for this film) and for brain - there are mysteries and puzzles in every frame and in every dialog.There is couple of Greenaway's thoughts on his first film and on the films that influenced him from the interview that was published in L'Avant-Scene Cinema"", No 333, October 1984:""Majority of my films may be viewed on several levels.

515003,A39UKBJJXJ82FO,B00002JWYK,Tristan,"[1, 1]","Peter Greenaway's maddening puzzle of a film, The Draughtman's Contract, involves us in a multi-layered, multi-themed murder mystery involving an artist and an entire cast of crudely distinctive characters. Taking place in a very exaggerated and very artistically inspired version of England in 1694, Mr. Neville (Anthony Higgins) is hired to sketch twelve separate landscape illustrations of the Herbert estate. He agrees, with the intention that he will be repaid with food, shelter, money, and sexual favors by the wife of the owner of the estate, Virgina Herbert (Janet Suzman). Things get weird when Mr. Neville begins to suspect that Mr. Herbert has somehow mysteriously been murdered due to slight changes in the particular landscapes he is sketching. It turns out that he isn't the only one who suspects murder as well. Unfortunately, his arrogant behavior eventually causes everyone to dislike and resent him. The deal that was originally set forth is soon broken, but the chaos has only just begun.Peter Greenaway's The Draughtman's Contract is a maddeningly ridiculous film. This statement becomes meaningless, however, when I realize that this is probably his most accessible film for the casual viewer. In terms of content, it is mild. In terms of over-the-top imagery, it's consistently focused and has little to no complicated structural camerawork. In fact, every shot in the film is a static shot. There are almost no close-ups, there is almost always more than one person on screen, and the entire film is shot with fixed master-shot camera angles. Because of this, many viewers will find the film alienating. It doesn't help that every character is dressed in such over-the-top garb. All of the dialogue in this film sounds irrelevant and excessive. The characters all speak in tangents and vocal riddles. Of course what most viewers don't seem to realize is that this is all a distraction technique to bring more attention to less important things. This is a film in which a murder-one is the least of anyone's concerns. The characters in this film were raised in such a way that superficial aspects of family and of circumstance play more into the thoughts of the characters than anything else. The only character in the entire film that actually seems concerned for what's going on at this estate is a complete sloth. This character would be the draughtman in this story and his contract concerns sexual favors in exchange for artwork. The viewer already knows, fairly early on, that his artwork will become less important in the grand scheme of things, and more important to the plot. This man has all the clues to a mystery murder, and it all exists nowhere else except for in his artwork. By the end of this film, the audience will know only a few things. This film's structure exists in details. Like many fans have said, it really is like the film equivalent of a crossword puzzle. We only know some of the answers, and we have to put the rest of the film together using only what we DO know, which is almost nothing except the bare minimum. There are exactly five major plot twists in this story, one of which occurs fairly early on, but we will never know the purpose of any of them until we reach the end of the picture.In my opinion, one of Peter Greenaway's intentions was to make a sort of feminist film, the difference being that the feminism exists at a time when feminine qualities and women were not taken seriously and were often discriminated against. This is a film in which men are in power, but women are in control in the sense that they use their pain and their repression as a sort of weapon to combat the discrimination. It is difficult to elaborate on what I mean without getting into spoiler territory, however, so I will instead use this opportunity to try and back up my opinion in a way that doesn't evade to plot details for the casual reader, because I am sure many viewers will disagree with me on this opinion. A common theme that Peter Greenaway uses in his films is pure inhumanity vs cruel humanity. In many of his films, the most realistic or most passionate character is a person who is guilty of terrible acts. In this case, the title character is the perpetrator. Early on, the contract in question falls through only for a separate character to recreate and renew it in some form. The audience knows that only trouble can come out of this business, but we hope that somehow the draughtman is smart enough to see through it and come up with his own way of turning the tables. I won't ruin whether he does or not, because that's not the point. In order for Greenaway and his actors to stay true to the style of this murder mystery, however, the characters must be surrounded with as many red herrings as possible. For example, the large amount of characters and what they intend to do, by the end of the film, seems to have led nowhere. There is also a touch of surrealism involving a very bizarre statue located in the courtyard of the estate that only seems to catch the eye of the young and the low class. Now, historical accuracy aside, a lot of these details don't linger in the mind upon film conclusion. Throughout the film we may wonder what's going on, but the film ends on a factually satisfying note that ends up leaving many of the mysterious aspects of the film in the dust. Peter Greenaway would proceed to do this more and more with his films, which is why I recommend that if someone is new to the cinematic world of Peter Greenaway that they watch The Draughtman's Contract multiple times, because the off-putting aspects of his subsequent films will become harder and harder to digest without proper mental context.Despite my high praise for this film, this is easily one of my least favorite Greenaway pictures. Peter Greenaway is my favorite English filmmaker, but aspects of The Draughtman's Contract have always left me cold. As accessible as this film is, it is also one of his more challenging films. If one is going to start watching Peter Greenaway, my personal recommendation to start with is The Cook the Thief His Wife & Her Lover. As utterly bizarre, disturbing, and emotional as that film is, it is also one in which all of his commonly used themes are on full and exuberant display in every shot and in every plot development. It is a difficult film to swallow, but an easy film to understand and appreciate when one knows what to look for. This is more than I can say for, for example, Drowning By Numbers (which I didn't even notice the actual numbers that appear throughout the film on the screen and in dialogue until the film was almost over, though I did notice the drownings), and The Baby of Mcon (which was absolutely one of the most unpleasant and disgusting film viewing experiences I've ever had in my life and the thought of people watching it without viewing even a single other Greenaway film beforehand makes my skin crawl). It is also the closest he has come to making a genre picture, it is the film that got me into his work, and it is my favorite film of his as well as my second favorite film of all time. Peter Greenaway has stated in the past that filmmakers who want to tell stories should instead be writers. I understand exactly what he means when he says this, but I think part of what makes cinema and film progress as an art form is the new ways people have discovered to tell the stories that they want to tell. For example, my third favorite film is David Lynch's Eraserhead, which is a film that Peter Greenaway himself has said is a masterpiece. To many people, it is a work of extreme ugliness and nightmarishness. To me it is all those things upon immediate reflection, but on second thought it is a beautiful, haunting, and very funny, sometimes gross, story about the beauty of parenthood.",4,Probably the most

515004,A35LBOT3SMEBRF,B00002JWYK,Wayne,"[4, 6]","This is an enigma of a film from Peter Greenaway. A intriguing and complex puzzle that is difficult to decipher. It will have you watching it many  times to try and discover who the culprit is. It is set in 1694 England. A  draughtsman is asked by a lady to make twelve drawings of her house. In  return, the man asks for money, and to use the lady for his intimate needs.  It's all going along as normal, then strange things start to happen. Stone  statues start to walk around, objects in the drawings start to move, then  the lady's husband is found murdered. The search is then on to find the  culprit. The DVD is Ok. The picture in widescreen 1.66:1 is clear, and the  sound in mono is alright. The extras are just filmographies and awards, and  production credits. It deserves a few more extras. The film is still a  great piece of puzzling cinema. The cast all wear beautiful costumes, and  speak in a statement-like manner.

515005,AQP1VPK16SVWM,B00002JWYK,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[15, 15]","This new digital transfer looks quite nice but keep in mind the limitations of the format it was shot in--Super 16mm (most TV shows were shot in 16mm for British TV and this was financed by Channel 4--when watching this new digitally restored transfer of ""The Draughtman's Contract"". The plan was for a theatrical release and then a TV airing. The budget was quite small. Super 16mm doesn't yield the fine detail of 35mm or 70mm. The transfer is an improvement over the previously available DVD but it also reveals the flaws of the source so the high definition elements can't mask the limitations of Super 16mm.The real reason to get this though is for the extras. We get a commentary track by director Peter Greenaway as well as an introduction that's almost long enough to be a featurette on the making of the film. We also get deleted scenes, an interview with composer Michael Nyman (""The Piano""--this was one of Nyman's first scores), a restoration demonstration, behind-the-scenes footage and on set interviews and the original theatrical trailer for the film. There is also a booklet with an essay by Greenaway (don't read it until AFTER you have seen the film if this is your first time viewing it)and an interview with Cinematographer Curtis Clark discussing how he and Greenaway decided to use Super 16mm and the challenge of shooting only by candlelight.""The Draughtman's Contract"" won't be for everyone. Director Peter Greenaway deliberately sought to subvert the way a traditional period piece was portrayed in film with this unusual and elliptic mystery. Part social commentary and avant garde period piece. Greenaway has his actors behave in a stiff, formal way often posing as often as performing. Imagine an avant-garde period film written by Patricia Highsmith and directed by Alfred Hitchcock and you might just get an idea of what ""The Draughtman's Contract"" is like.The plot is simple--Mr. Neville a draughtsman who creates pictures of valuable items for the wealthy is employed by Mrs. Herbert the wife of a stuffy and insufferably man. She plans to give the pictures that Neville draws as a gift to her husband when he returns from his journey. Neville's terms are difficult to say the least--he demands that she engage in degrading sex with him, provide room and board plus his usual fee. Neville thinks himself superior to those he provides service to and makes that quite clear his speech and attitude. It's a time of stuffy people doing stuffy things and Neville takes advantage of it. In many respects, Neville is just as bad as the master of the house subjecting the family to his whims but things take an unusual turn when it appears that a murder may have been committed.""The Draughtman's Contract"" is certainly unusual and for those adventurous enough to try it (and those that enjoy ""art films"" something that Greenaway was trying to take the stuffing out of anyway with this film), you'll probably enjoy it. It is an acquired taste so I would recommend a rental before purchasing.",4,"Not everyone will be ""drawn"" to this mystery--commentary, featurettes and new transfer highlight of set",1203638400,"02 22, 2008",2008,3015,"['new', 'digital', 'transfer', 'quite', 'nice', 'keep', 'mind', 'limitations', 'format', 'was', 'shot', 'Super', '16mm', 'most', 'TV', 'shows', 'were', 'shot', '16mm', 'British', 'TV', 'was', 'financed', 'Channel', '4', 'when', 'watching', 'new', 'digitally', 'restored', 'transfer', 'Draughtman', 'Contract', 'plan', 'was', 'theatrical', 'release', 'then', 'TV', 'airing', 'budget', 'was', 'quite', 'small', 'Super', '16mm', ""n't"", 'yield', 'fine', 'detail', '35mm', '70mm', 'transfer', 'improvement', 'previously', 'available', 'DVD', 'also', 'flaws', 'source', 'high', 'definition', 'elements', 'ca', ""n't"", 'mask', 'limitations', 'Super', '16mm.The', 'real', 'reason', 'get', 'though', 'extras', 'get', 'commentary', 'track', 'director', 'Peter', 'Greenaway', 'as', 'well', 'introduction', 'almost', 'long', 'enough', 'be', 'featurette', 'making', 'film', 'also', 'get', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'interview', 'composer', 'Michael', 'Nyman', 'Piano', 'was', 'one', 'Nyman', 'first', 'scores', 'restoration', 'demonstration', 'behind-the-scenes', 'footage', 'set', 'interviews', 'original', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'film', 'also', 'booklet', 'essay', 'Greenaway', 'do', ""n't"", 'read', 'AFTER', 'have', 'seen', 'film', 'first', 'time', 'viewing', 'interview', 'Cinematographer', 'Curtis', 'Clark', 'discussing', 'how', 'Greenaway', 'decided', 'use', 'Super', '16mm', 'challenge', 'shooting', 'only', 'candlelight', 'Draughtman', 'Contract', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'everyone', 'Director', 'Peter', 'Greenaway', 'deliberately', 'sought', 'subvert', 'way', 'traditional', 'period', 'piece', 'was', 'portrayed', 'film', 'unusual', 'elliptic', 'mystery', 'Part', 'social', 'commentary', 'avant', 'garde', 'period', 'piece', 'Greenaway', 'actors', 'behave', 'stiff', 'formal', 'way', 'often', 'posing', 'as', 'often', 'performing', 'Imagine', 'avant-garde', 'period', 'film', 'written', 'Patricia', 'Highsmith', 'directed', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'might', 'just', 'get', 'idea', 'what', 'Draughtman', 'Contract', 'like.The', 'plot', 'simple', 'Mr.', 'Neville', 'draughtsman', 'who', 'pictures', 'valuable', 'items', 'wealthy', 'employed', 'Mrs.', 'Herbert', 'wife', 'stuffy', 'insufferably', 'man', 'give', 'pictures', 'Neville', 'gift', 'husband', 'when', 'journey', 'Neville', 'terms', 'are', 'difficult', 'say', 'least', 'engage', 'degrading', 'sex', 'provide', 'room', 'board', 'usual', 'fee', 'Neville', 'superior', 'service', 'quite', 'clear', 'speech', 'attitude', 'time', 'stuffy', 'people', 'doing', 'stuffy', 'things', 'Neville', 'advantage', 'many', 'respects', 'Neville', 'just', 'as', 'bad', 'master', 'house', 'subjecting', 'family', 'whims', 'things', 'take', 'unusual', 'turn', 'when', 'murder', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'committed', 'Draughtman', 'Contract', 'certainly', 'unusual', 'adventurous', 'enough', 'try', 'enjoy', 'art', 'films', 'something', 'Greenaway', 'was', 'trying', 'take', 'stuffing', 'anyway', 'film', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'enjoy', 'acquired', 'taste', 'would', 'recommend', 'rental', 'purchasing']",N/A

The plot, such as it is, concerns the way the pictures become infused with allegorical clues of adultery and murder, a kind ofBlow Upfrom before the age of mechanical reproduction.  This being a Greenaway movie, however, the heart of the matter lies in the richness of the costumes and visual compositions, and a theme-and-variation style repetition of certain scenes.
