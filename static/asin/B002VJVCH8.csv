1293446,A3HCZTTUH3CW9Z,B002VJVCH8,Amy Henley,"[3, 5]","This video contains 5 twenty minute segments from 5 different instructors, Violet Zacki (Strength), Hemalayaa (Yoga), Kristin McGee (Pilates), Desi Bartlett (Dance), and Petra Kobler (Cardio).  Like a previous reviewer I want to caution that these are segments from previously released videos.  However, I think that the DVD is a great way to get to know different instructors to see if you would like to own the longer videos or others by them.  I was a little disappointed that the Violet Zacki segment was from a DVD I already own, Weight Loss Cardio Sculpt because I'm looking forward to any new release by her.  However, I enjoyed the other segments.  Hemalayaa's segment is from Hemalayaa:Yoga is for everyone.  Krisin McGee's segment is from Weight Loss Pilates.  Desi Bartlett's section is from Dance and Be Fit: Latin Groove.  Petra Kolber's segment is from Cardio is for Beginners.  For each instructor there is a link to play workout, other DVDs to try, and an ""about the instructor.""  The one thing I have issue with is that you can't link the segments into longer workouts.  You have to manually click each one to do it.  I think this video is more for beginners, but can be used for light days or played in conjunction with other workouts for those more intermediate or advanced.",4,Great way to vary your workouts,1271808000,"04 21, 2010",2010,1293,"['video', '5', 'twenty', 'minute', 'segments', '5', 'different', 'instructors', 'Violet', 'Zacki', 'Strength', 'Hemalayaa', 'Yoga', 'Kristin', 'McGee', 'Pilates', 'Desi', 'Bartlett', 'Dance', 'Petra', 'Kobler', 'Cardio', 'previous', 'reviewer', 'want', 'caution', 'are', 'segments', 'previously', 'released', 'videos', 'However', 'think', 'DVD', 'great', 'way', 'get', 'know', 'different', 'instructors', 'see', 'would', 'like', 'own', 'longer', 'videos', 'others', 'was', 'little', 'disappointed', 'Violet', 'Zacki', 'segment', 'was', 'DVD', 'already', 'own', 'Weight', 'Loss', 'Cardio', 'Sculpt', ""'m"", 'looking', 'forward', 'new', 'release', 'However', 'enjoyed', 'other', 'segments', 'Hemalayaa', 'segment', 'Hemalayaa', 'Yoga', 'everyone', 'Krisin', 'McGee', 'segment', 'Weight', 'Loss', 'Pilates', 'Desi', 'Bartlett', 'section', 'Dance', 'Be', 'Fit', 'Latin', 'Groove', 'Petra', 'Kolber', 'segment', 'Cardio', 'Beginners', 'instructor', 'link', 'play', 'workout', 'other', 'DVDs', 'try', 'instructor', 'one', 'thing', 'have', 'issue', 'ca', ""n't"", 'link', 'segments', 'longer', 'workouts', 'have', 'manually', 'click', 'one', 'do', 'think', 'video', 'more', 'beginners', 'can', 'be', 'used', 'light', 'days', 'played', 'conjunction', 'other', 'workouts', 'more', 'intermediate', 'advanced']",N/A

1293448,A17V9XL4CWTQ6G,B002VJVCH8,Chandler,"[11, 11]","have quite a library of fitness DVDs in order to keep my motivation, attention, and keep my body evolving as well. However, if you prefer to own very few or even just one, this might actually be a great pick because of both the variety and the good workouts.I wear a Bodybugg (the arm devices you see on the contestants of the Biggest Loser) which tells me my exact caloric burn not only during a workout, but the entire day. I only mention this so you know that when I mention the calorie burn it is not via perceived exertion but, instead, what I measured scientifically. It allows me not only to see the burn during the workout as compared to other workouts, but any metabolism boost gained after the workout as well.The DVD is put together so that the viewer can choose a different workout 5 days a week. However, because these are only 20 min. workouts and some offer light caloric burn (but good strength training), I would suggest you might want to either do 2 segments or combine this with walking etc. for optimum calorie burn.First, STRENGTH TRAINING workout portion is from a DVD I have already reviewed on Amazon and is one of my favorites. They have taken the best parts of that DVD and made it into one 20 minute workout so it still feels like a new DVD to me although I've done it many times before. I love the trainer Violet Zaki for her great cueing, great instruction, but even more so REALLY good workout. The caloric burn here is an A plus for a 20 minute strength training workout. Typically strength training results in burning less calories during the workout, yet increasing your caloric burn long after the workout is over. This one actually does both. Because she combines the strength training with cardio, you have a great burn for 20 min and it continues after the workout. It's a HIIT workout meaning you do bursts of cardio and strength resulting in double the gain in less time. Anyone can follow her instruction, even if you've never done it before, just start with lighter weights and increase as you go. The setting is in a cool urban loft. You won't feel a heavy exertion but she works out 2 body parts during all moves and boosts your burn with cardio so you get a big bang for your buck. Handweights needed.The YOGA portion, also at 20 minutes like all the others, is by Hemalayaa. This is one I do when I don't feel the motivation to workout after a long stressful day because it actually de-stresses you and then you suddenly find yourself enjoying the workout, especially with her setting of candlelight and her calm voice and smooth instruction. This section is done on a yoga mat, concentrates on bending and stretching, moving energy through your body, destressing, and lengthening your muscles. The caloric burn is low but that's not the prime benefit. For a well-rounded training, the benefits to both your muscles, mind, and even flowing oxygenated blood through your internal organs and aiding digestion is all in this segment. There are times during this segment that her instruction, wasn't clear enough to me without looking up at the tv to understand what she was doing...and looking up isn't what I was supposed to be doing at the time. This won't matter after you do the DVD a few times as it was easily learned, but the first time I needed greater clarity when I couldn't look up. Mat needed. All levels.The next segment was the PILATES segment. This is a great way of doing Pilates because the instructor, Kristin McGee, mixes the Pilates moves with upbeat cardio blasts so she upped the calorie burn of this to high...not because it was high during the whole workout (it was medium) but because the strength training was so good that my metabolism & caloric burn stayed elevated far after the workout was done. This one is GREAT for your abs. She really incorporates moves to hit all your ab muscles in addition to all your other needed body parts as well! Pilates concentrates on your muscle tone through strength and stretching but the cardio burst meant fat burn as well. Her cueing was wonderful. Even during the times I was looking away from the tv the instruction was very clear. The setting was in the same modern loft as the strength training portion, though redecorated Eastern style & with added candles and greenery, yet some cuts were to her on a rooftop balcony garden. Really hit muscles I don't often get and her personality was very warm and enjoyable. Easy to follow even if you've never done Pilates before.The DANCE portion is a fun merengue, salsa, step and rumba but don't be daunted. I am the LEAST coordinated person on the planet and so I rarely enjoy dance fitness DVDs due to their frustration level for me. However, I liked this one. It was upbeat, kept me moving, had a B plus calorie burn because I kept moving the whole time with arms and legs and even worked out the tummy with the twists. However, I have to say the instructor...hmmm, really odd. She is a voice over while you watch the dancers and I swear she must normally teach little kids to dance. She would insert fake giggles constantly as though trying to sound fun and cute but it was quite strange because it would be in a part that you couldn't figure out why it happened and in a voice as though talking to kids...""Now you take that left foot and put it forward...he he he he he. Give me a big smile now! All the way up the corners of that mouth! he he he he"" You look wonderful!"" First time I have ever been told I needed to smile bigger for my empty room when working out but hey, it probably eases stress. Still, she could tone down the obviously fake giggles a notch and I would love this more. I forgive her, it was a great dance portion and fun. The setting was an outside dance gazebo-style stage with Latin music.And finally the CARDIO portion was another great segment. In fact, I liked it enough to want to buy the DVD this edited version came from. The calorie burn was an A for just a 20 min workout (but again, 20 min workouts are always going to not quite get your target heart rate up there long enough, you may want to add on an extra 15 min of something else sometime that day). She keeps your arms AND feet moving at all times to up that burn. This is taught by Petra Kolber. The setting is a penthouse. There are 3 instructors here and 2 are not ""hard bodies"" which can actually be motivational to see them still move with such ease. Her cueing is wonderful and easy to follow. She offers good safety instructions for beginners and if you hate cardio DVDs that have floor work, this one will keep you moving upright and getting just as much benefit.Conclusion: They truly chose workouts edited in 20 minute segments that give you the most bang for your buck and work perfectly together for full-body benefit. I loved this DVD and there isn't one segment that I wouldn't recommend. Additionally, the change in instructors, music, moves, and scenery can keep up your motivation and attention span and give you tastes of several workouts that may lead to you deciding of which ones you might want the full version.",5,Like getting 5 DVDs in one; 5 20 minute workouts from their top DVDs,1276819200,"06 18, 2010",2010,7081,"['have', 'library', 'fitness', 'DVDs', 'order', 'keep',

This workout DVD contains five 20-minute workouts that offer a mix of disciplines to maximize results in minimum time.  Five top instructors offer a variety of styles to banish boredome.  Fit in 5 feaures a compilation of five workouts from some of Acacia's best-selling workouts.The five workouts include a strength workout that blends cardio and strength training to boost your metabolism and burn fat.  Violet Zaki leads this workout that originally came from the Weight Loss Cardio Sculpt DVD.  It requires the use of light hand weights.Hemalayaa, a certified yoga instructor, leads the yoga workout on this DVD that is meant to tone, stretch and strengthen.  It originally appeared on Yoga For Everyone.  This is a slow paced yoga workout that aims to stretch and strengthen your muscles rather than leave your heart pumping.Also included is a pilates workout by Kristin McGee that combines traditional movies with cardio blasts made to get your heart pumping!  The workout originally appeared on Weight Loss Pilates.  I found this to be a good all around workout that was easy to keep up with.Desi Bartlett leads the dance workout that teaches you the Merengue, Salsa step and Rumba to tone up the tummy and the entire body.  I had a tough time following this one but that is probably because of my less than stellar coordination.  The dances were fun and upbeat.  This workout originally appeared on Dance and Be Fit: Latin Groove.Petra Kolber, IDEA fitness instructor of the year leads the Cardio workout that burns calories and strengthens the heart.  It's an easy to follow cardio workout that beginners should have no problem with. It's originally from the Cardio for Beginners DVD.There is a total of 108 minutes worth of routines on this DVD.  Each workout takes 20 minutes to complete and could be done by itself or in combination with another workout. It's designed to be done over a period of 5 days hence the title Fit in 5.  You won't be bored by doing the same old routine because each day is different with a different instructor and a different discipline.  I recommend this DVD for both beginners and the more experienced exerciser.",5,Fit in 5: Ultimate Body Blitz,1268784000,"03 17, 2010",2010,2243,"['Fit', '5', 'Ultimate', 'Body', 'Blitz', 'Acadia', 'latest', 'workout', 'DVD', 'due', 'out', 'March', '23', '2010', 'workout', 'DVD', 'five', '20-minute', 'workouts', 'offer', 'mix', 'disciplines', 'maximize', 'results', 'minimum', 'time', 'Five', 'top', 'instructors', 'offer', 'variety', 'styles', 'banish', 'boredome', 'Fit', '5', 'feaures', 'compilation', 'five', 'workouts', 'Acacia', 'best-selling', 'workouts.The', 'five', 'workouts', 'include', 'strength', 'workout', 'cardio', 'strength', 'training', 'boost', 'metabolism', 'burn', 'fat', 'Violet', 'Zaki', 'workout', 'originally', 'came', 'Weight', 'Loss', 'Cardio', 'Sculpt', 'DVD', 'use', 'light', 'hand', 'weights.Hemalayaa', 'certified', 'yoga', 'instructor', 'yoga', 'workout', 'DVD', 'meant', 'tone', 'stretch', 'strengthen', 'originally', 'appeared', 'Yoga', 'Everyone', 'slow', 'paced', 'yoga', 'stretch', 'strengthen', 'muscles', 'rather', 'leave', 'heart', 'pumping.Also', 'included', 'pilates', 'Kristin', 'McGee', 'traditional', 'movies', 'cardio', 'blasts', 'made', 'get', 'heart', 'pumping', 'workout', 'originally', 'appeared', 'Weight', 'Loss', 'Pilates', 'found', 'be', 'good', 'was', 'easy', 'keep', 'up', 'with.Desi', 'Bartlett', 'dance', 'workout', 'Merengue', 'Salsa', 'step', 'Rumba', 'tone', 'up', 'tummy', 'entire', 'body', 'had', 'tough', 'time', 'following', 'one', 'probably', 'less', 'stellar', 'coordination', 'dances', 'were', 'fun', 'upbeat', 'workout', 'originally', 'appeared', 'Dance', 'Be', 'Fit', 'Latin', 'Groove.Petra', 'Kolber', 'IDEA', 'fitness', 'instructor', 'year', 'Cardio', 'workout', 'calories', 'heart', 'easy', 'follow', 'cardio', 'workout', 'beginners', 'should', 'have', 'problem', 'originally', 'Cardio', 'Beginners', 'DVD.There', 'total', '108', 'minutes', 'routines', 'DVD', 'workout', '20', 'minutes', 'complete', 'could', 'be', 'done', 'combination', 'workout', 'designed', 'be', 'done', 'period', '5', 'days', 'hence', 'title', 'Fit', '5', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'bored', 'doing', 'same', 'old', 'routine', 'day', 'different', 'different', 'instructor', 'different', 'discipline', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'beginners', 'more', 'experienced', 'exerciser']",N/A

1293452,A1M7Y63Y5GYJI1,B002VJVCH8,Tracey Carter,"[2, 2]","I saw this DVD at the library and immediately had to check it out. I'm usually not a fan of workout DVDs but thought I'd give this one a try since all the workouts are 20 minutes long and each workout is a different type of exercise taught by a different instructor.The Strength Workout is 20 minutes long and uses cardio blasts and strength training which are Violet Zaki's trademark, however this 20 minute segment lacks a warm-up (unless you count the first five seconds where she instructs you to pick up your weights) and is far more challenging than the other four workouts included in Fit in 5. I was only able to complete about eight minutes of Zaki's workout and this is from someone who has used her other DVDs before and has completed two half marathons and several 5Ks.The Yoga Workout was nice but might move too fast for beginners although Hemalayaa provides plenty of detailed instructions including tips to help keep your body safe and to prevent overstretching or overextending yourself. The setting is peaceful and the background music is nicely unobtrusive. I didn't break a sweat while doing the yoga workout but I also didn't find it easy. It was in that nice middle ground that required effort without exertion. I'd love to try some of Hemalayaa's DVDs after sampling this workout.The Pilates Workout was okay. I wish I had something better to say about it but it wasn't really what I was expecting; I think the cardio blasts threw me off. I've taken both mat classes and equipment classes at a local Pilates studio and thought I'd be able to anticipate some of the series of moves as they're usually done in a prescribed order but that wasn't the case with McGee's workout. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't bad in any way, just not what I was expecting but I might try it again.The Dance Workout was my least favourite of the DVD and that's saying something when I rank it lower than the Strength Workout that I couldn't even finish. The instructor teaches using a voice over which is exactly what they did for the Yoga Workout but the voiceover worked quite well with the Yoga Workout but here? Not so much. The tone of Desi Bartlett's voice grated on my nerves and she didn't provide a lot of instruction for the steps she was using so I felt a bit lost throughout the workout. It's not a workout I'd repeat (and I like dancing!) and I certainly wouldn't go out and purchase any of Desi's other DVDs.Petra Kolber's Cardio Workout was easily my favourite from this DVD. At first it seemed far too easy and that I didn't have to put enough effort into it but when the DVD was finished I had definitely worked up a sweat! It was a great workout for beginners and included a warm-up and detailed instructions for every move. The workout was definitely a workout even though it didn't feel like one at all. I'm definitely looking to get some of Petra Kolber's other DVDs and am disappointed that my local library system doesn't own the DVD that this workout was taken from, which brings me to another point.All five workouts are taken from other Acacia workout DVDs so if you have an extensive fitness DVD library you may be duplicating something you already have, however, if you're like me and have say all of three workout DVDs then this DVD should provide you with a variety of new content and help you determine if you'd like to purchase any of the DVDs the workouts originally came from. I'm happy to have checked this item out from the library rather than purchasing it.",4,Fit in 5 Provides a Nice Variety of Workouts at Various Fitness Levels,1303516800,"04 23, 2011",2011,3494,"['saw', 'DVD', 'library', 'immediately', 'had', 'check', 'out', ""'m"", 'usually', 'not', 'fan', 'workout', 'DVDs', 'thought', ""'d"", 'give', 'one', 'try', 'workouts', 'are', '20', 'minutes', 'long', 'workout', 'different', 'type', 'exercise', 'taught', 'different', 'instructor.The', 'Strength', 'Workout', '20', 'minutes', 'long', 'cardio', 'blasts', 'strength', 'training', 'are', 'Violet', 'Zaki', 'trademark', 'however', '20', 'minute', 'segment', 'warm-up', 'count', 'first', 'five', 'seconds', 'where', 'pick', 'up', 'weights', 'far', 'more', 'challenging', 'other', 'four', 'workouts', 'included', 'Fit', '5', 'was', 'only', 'able', 'complete', 'eight', 'minutes', 'Zaki', 'workout', 'someone', 'who', 'used', 'other', 'DVDs', 'completed', 'two', 'half', 'marathons', 'several', '5Ks.The', 'Yoga', 'Workout', 'was', 'nice', 'might', 'move', 'too', 'fast', 'beginners', 'Hemalayaa', 'plenty', 'detailed', 'instructions', 'including', 'tips', 'help', 'keep', 'body', 'safe', 'prevent', 'overstretching', 'overextending', 'setting', 'peaceful', 'background', 'music', 'nicely', 'unobtrusive', 'did', ""n't"", 'break', 'sweat', 'doing', 'yoga', 'also', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'easy', 'was', 'nice', 'middle', 'ground', 'required', 'effort', 'exertion', ""'d"", 'love', 'try', 'Hemalayaa', 'DVDs', 'sampling', 'workout.The', 'Workout', 'was', 'okay', 'wish', 'had', 'something', 'better', 'say', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'what', 'was', 'expecting', 'think', 'cardio', 'threw', 'off', ""'ve"", 'taken', 'mat', 'classes', 'equipment', 'classes', 'local', 'Pilates', 'studio', 'thought', ""'d"", 'be', 'able', 'anticipate', 'series', 'moves', ""'re"", 'usually', 'done', 'prescribed', 'order', 'was', ""n't"", 'case', 'McGee', 'workout', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'way', 'just', 'not', 'what', 'was', 'expecting', 'might', 'try', 'again.The', 'Dance', 'Workout', 'was', 'least', 'favourite', 'DVD', 'saying', 'something', 'when', 'rank', 'lower', 'Strength', 'could', ""n't"", 'even', 'finish', 'instructor', 'using', 'voice', 'exactly', 'what', 'did', 'Yoga', 'Workout', 'voiceover', 'worked', 'quite', 'well', 'Yoga', 'Workout', 'here', 'Not', 'so', 'much', 'tone', 'Desi', 'Bartlett', 'voice', 'grated', 'nerves', 'did', ""n't"", 'provide', 'lot', 'instruction', 'steps', 'was', 'using', 'so', 'felt', 'bit', 'lost', 'workout', 'not', 'workout', ""'d"", 'repeat', 'like', 'dancing', 'certainly', 'would', ""n't"", 'go', 'out', 'purchase', 'Desi', 'other', 'DVDs.Petra', 'Kolber', 'Cardio', 'Workout', 'was', 'easily', 'favourite', 'DVD', 'first', 'seemed', 'far', 'too', 'easy', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'put', 'enough', 'effort', 'when', 'DVD', 'was', 'finished', 'had', 'definitely', 'worked', 'up', 'sweat', 'was', 'great', 'workout', 'beginners', 'included', 'warm-up', 'detailed', 'instructions', 'move', 'workout', 'was', 'definitely', 'workout', 'even', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'one', ""'m"", 'definitely', 'looking', 'get', 'Petra', 'Kolber', 'other', 'DVDs', 'am', 'disappointed', 'local', 'library', 'system', ""n't"", 'own', 'DVD', 'workout', 'was', 'taken', 'point.All', 'five', 'workouts', 'are', 'taken', 'other', 'Acacia', 'workout', 'DVDs', 'so', 'have', 'extensive', 'fitness', 'DVD', 'library', 'may', 'be', 'duplicating', 'something', 'already', 'have', 'however', ""'re"", 'have', 'say', 'three', 'DVDs', 'then', 'DVD', 'should', 'provide', 'variety', 'new', 'content', 'help', 'determine', ""'d"", 'like', 'purchase', 'DVDs', 'workouts', 'originally', 'came', ""'m"", 'happy', 'have', 'checked', 'item', 'library', 'rather', 'purchasing']",N/A
