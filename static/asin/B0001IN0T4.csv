Since most who will be buying the DVD set know the story, I will write about the DVD only. The video quality of the DVD is better than when the series first aired on TV. I was pleasantly suprised how clear the picture was, with deep colors, and no over-saturation. The sound is good. Overall, this is an excellent set of DVD's (there are 5 DVD's in the set).If you were a fand of POF, then you will not be disappointed with the quality of the DVD set. My only gripe, and it is a small one, is there is a 2 second black screen where the commercials used to be. I am sure there must be a better way to transition from a scene to a scene than to use a black screen. But like I said, it is only a second, and it in no way distracts from the storyline. The only reason I am bringing it up is so perhaps FOX can find a better transition when they release season two.I am giving Season One 5 stars, because I love the show, because the quality of the DVD's is better than what originally aired on TV, and because it is a great value. I paid $40 for the set, and recieved 22 episodes and a DVD with many extra's. That comes out to less than 2 dollars an episode, and I love that price point (compare that to Deep Space Nine Season One which has two less episodes but costs over $100.00).All I can say is Thank You FOX, you made a great set.",5,DVD set is excellent,1083801600,"05 6, 2004",2004,1396,"['just', 'picked', 'up', 'Party', 'Five', 'Season', 'One', 'am', 'very', 'happy', 'most', 'who', 'will', 'be', 'buying', 'DVD', 'set', 'know', 'story', 'will', 'write', 'DVD', 'only', 'video', 'quality', 'DVD', 'better', 'when', 'series', 'first', 'aired', 'TV', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'suprised', 'how', 'clear', 'picture', 'was', 'deep', 'colors', 'over-saturation', 'sound', 'good', 'Overall', 'excellent', 'set', 'DVD', 'are', '5', 'DVD', 'set', 'were', 'fand', 'POF', 'then', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'disappointed', 'quality', 'DVD', 'set', 'only', 'gripe', 'small', 'one', '2', 'second', 'black', 'screen', 'where', 'commercials', 'used', 'be', 'am', 'sure', 'must', 'be', 'better', 'way', 'transition', 'scene', 'scene', 'use', 'black', 'screen', 'said', 'only', 'second', 'way', 'storyline', 'only', 'reason', 'am', 'bringing', 'up', 'so', 'perhaps', 'FOX', 'can', 'find', 'better', 'transition', 'when', 'release', 'season', 'two.I', 'am', 'giving', 'Season', 'One', '5', 'stars', 'love', 'show', 'quality', 'DVD', 'better', 'what', 'originally', 'aired', 'TV', 'great', 'value', 'paid', '40', 'set', 'recieved', '22', 'episodes', 'DVD', 'many', 'extra', 'out', 'less', '2', 'dollars', 'episode', 'love', 'price', 'point', 'compare', 'Deep', 'Space', 'Nine', 'Season', 'One', 'two', 'less', 'episodes', '100.00', '.All', 'can', 'say', 'Thank', 'FOX', 'made', 'great', 'set']",N/A

807662,A2OF0Z2L9STEQF,B0001IN0T4,Kevin Caffrey,"[3, 3]","Although heaped with much praise when it first started in 1994, in the years since it went off the air with little fanfare in 2000, ""Party of Five"" is rarely ever mentioned.  It could be because of the pretty big shark jumps in the last season or so (rapid aging of youngest sibling Owen, pregnancies, marriage, etc.) that ""Party of Five"" fizzled out rather than ended on a high note.  However, there's no denying that the first season packed a pretty emotional punch and stands the test of time very well.There wasn't much like ""Party of Five"" on TV in the mid-90s.  You still had the perpetually silly/unrealistic ""90210"" and ""Melrose Place,"" the intelligent yet sometimes-too-angsty ""My So Called Life,"" and the ridiculous ""Dawson's Creek.""  ""Party of Five"" was different in that it had realistic, complex characters dealing with getting over the death of their parents at the hands of a drunk driver.  All of these characters carried a heavy burden upon their shoulders in having to do all they could to manage life on their own without supervising, responsible adults.  Oldest son Charlie (24) carries the heaviest weight in having to look after his teenage brother and sister, eleven year old sister, and nine-month old baby brother.  The fact that he doesn't have a steady job and is barely out of the teenage/college kid mindset himself doesn't make things easy.  This is a compelling concept for a television series.  The episodes are smartly written, the acting very good, and the cinematography is warm and inviting.  The first season really sets the stage for the excellent following two seasons, which will hopefully be released on DVD someday.  This collection includes several cast/writer commentaries and two documentaries on the show.Is ""Party of Five"" schmaltzy in some spots?  Definitely.  Does it often seem like nothing can go right for the Salingers?  Sure.  But, honestly, this is the most realistic characterization of people that you're likely to see on network television.  Pay special attention to the way that these are characters that often simply just scream when they're angry, as opposed to the long, thoughtful speeches that other characters in similiar shows are always reciting.  I recently heard a rumor that the 2nd Season (originally set for release in Nov. 2004) has been put on hold.  Perhaps the low sales for Season One is a result of the fact that for some reason, people seem to have forgotten how good this show really was.  Hopefully people will rediscover it again soon.",4,Inexplicably Underrated,1092787200,"08 18, 2004",2004,2517,"['heaped', 'much', 'praise', 'when', 'first', 'started', '1994', 'years', 'went', 'air', 'little', 'fanfare', '2000', 'Party', 'Five', 'rarely', 'ever', 'mentioned', 'could', 'be', 'pretty', 'big', 'shark', 'jumps', 'last', 'season', 'so', 'rapid', 'aging', 'youngest', 'sibling', 'Owen', 'pregnancies', 'marriage', 'etc', 'Party', 'Five', 'fizzled', 'out', 'rather', 'ended', 'high', 'note', 'However', 'denying', 'first', 'season', 'packed', 'pretty', 'emotional', 'punch', 'test', 'time', 'very', 'well.There', 'was', ""n't"", 'much', 'Party', 'Five', 'TV', 'mid-90s', 'still', 'had', 'perpetually', 'silly/unrealistic', '90210', 'Melrose', 'Place', 'intelligent', 'yet', 'sometimes-too-angsty', 'So', 'Called', 'Life', 'ridiculous', 'Dawson', 'Creek', 'Party', 'Five', 'was', 'different', 'had', 'realistic', 'complex', 'characters', 'dealing', 'getting', 'death', 'parents', 'hands', 'drunk', 'driver', 'characters', 'carried', 'heavy', 'burden', 'shoulders', 'having', 'do', 'could', 'manage', 'life', 'own', 'supervising', 'responsible', 'adults', 'Oldest', 'son', 'Charlie', '24', 'heaviest', 'weight', 'having', 'look', 'teenage', 'brother', 'sister', 'eleven', 'year', 'old', 'sister', 'nine-month', 'old', 'baby', 'brother', 'fact', ""n't"", 'have', 'steady', 'job', 'barely', 'teenage/college', 'kid', 'mindset', ""n't"", 'make', 'things', 'easy', 'compelling', 'concept', 'television', 'series', 'episodes', 'are', 'smartly', 'written', 'acting', 'very', 'good', 'cinematography', 'warm', 'inviting', 'first', 'season', 'really', 'stage', 'excellent', 'following', 'two', 'seasons', 'will', 'hopefully', 'be', 'released', 'DVD', 'someday', 'collection', 'several', 'cast/writer', 'commentaries', 'two', 'documentaries', 'show.Is', 'Party', 'Five', 'schmaltzy', 'spots', 'Definitely', 'often', 'seem', 'nothing', 'can', 'go', 'right', 'Salingers', 'Sure', 'honestly', 'most', 'realistic', 'characterization', 'people', ""'re"", 'likely', 'see', 'network', 'television', 'Pay', 'special', 'attention', 'way', 'are', 'characters', 'often', 'simply', 'just', 'scream', 'when', ""'re"", 'angry', 'opposed', 'long', 'thoughtful', 'speeches', 'other', 'characters', 'similiar', 'shows', 'are', 'always', 'reciting', 'recently', 'heard', 'rumor', '2nd', 'Season', 'originally', 'set', 'release', 'Nov.', '2004', 'been', 'put', 'hold', 'Perhaps', 'low', 'sales', 'Season', 'One', 'result', 'fact', 'reason', 'people', 'seem', 'have', 'forgotten', 'how', 'good', 'show', 'really', 'was', 'Hopefully', 'people', 'will', 'rediscover', 'again', 'soon']",N/A
807663,A1KT1GWCW8F80,B0001IN0T4,K. Gittins,"[7, 19]","&lt;----- May contain spoilers ---->This is the comedy show where the San Francisco household of 5 brothers and sisters is run by a 3 foot tall, 11-year old munchkin named Clod who plays a violin. Unfortunately, in this first season, her voice has yet to change into that nails-on-blackboard screech that will amuse us for the next 5 or so years. Sadly, we discover she will not realize her childhood dream of marrying her gay violin teacher. Talk about spoiling the fun!Another comedy character is her older sister, Jool, who is 15 years old, but looks 20 which enables her to illegally work in a bar and wear revealing leather outfits, and to date men in their twenties or thirties. However, she counteracts her physically-advanced appearance by having the mentality of an 8 year old schizophrenic. She can - and does - skwinch her face into a simultaneous frown and smile, and sighs at the same time. This is no easy feat. She does it in nearly every scene, in reaction to every event, which alone should have won some type of acting award - like a Razzie.Next is Bailey, a 24 year old high school junior. He is often referred to as Bay - as in ""why don't we just dump your body in San Francisco Bay?"". It is funny that he supposedly is the soft and caring one of the group, but spends most of his time yelling at everyone. Everyone else yells too, but nevermind that. He finally loses his virginity to another 20-something high school drug addict that no one else likes. Either she is not too smart or is very smart, by asking Bay how fast his Jeep went - hey, it's not a Ferrari - to draw attention to herself. In a gut-busting comedic turn, he spends much of his time trying to dump her yet always goes back to her, cuz see, now he's whipped. Later, instead of checking in to rehab, she checks out - permanently. Just say no!The top rung on the ladder is Charlie. He has always been a loser and normally fails at everything he tries. This is apparently due to a birth defect resulting in his brain being lodged in his pants, giving him ""women problems"". Not the kind of ""woman problems"" that Clod discovers, but problems with a particular woman because of all his past women. They love each other and fight for several episodes until finally she moves in, and they fight some more. You can't write funnier stuff than that. Except the time when Charlie makes the decision to move to Seattle to actually make something of himself, but the others don't want to go. Then they decide they will go after all, but Charlie has backed out of the business deal to spare them the hassle of a) Clod giving up the violin she doesn't want to play anymore, anyway, B) Jool giving up a re-tread boyfriend, and C) Bay just giving up.There is an adage in Hollywood about not working with children or pets. In comedic disregard, the producers put a lethargic panting dog named Thurber in the show. There is also a baby named Owen played by three sets of twins, but not all at once.A few other highlights include Jool spending 800 bucks on model photography and apparently ending up in the photo that comes in new photograph frames. Clod's violin teacher gets in touch with his feminine side and decides to become a mother by adopting a new-born baby. Too numerous to itemize are the instances of sticking noses where they don't belong, saying silly things, and never ever taking a hint.Overall, I did shed a tear - for buying this. Seriously, I'm surprised it made it past the pilot, but it's good that many people apparently got something out of it - all that pain and suffering should not go to waste. I appreciate the effort that went into the show but not the result.DVD extras include 3 cast commentaries that are quite sparse and mostly giggles. The co-producer's commentaries are a little better. The collection of short cast/crew comments was passable.",2,Hardly a five,1084492800,"05 14, 2004",2004,3847,"['lt', 'May', 'contain', 'spoilers', '>', 'comedy', 'show', 'where', 'San', 'Francisco', 'household', '5', 'brothers', 'sisters', 'run', '3', 'foot', 'tall', '11-year', 'old', 'munchkin', 'named', 'Clod', 'who', 'violin', 'Unfortunately', 'first', 'season', 'voice', 'yet', 'change', 'nails-on-blackboard', 'screech', 'will', 'amuse', 'next', '5', 'so', 'years', 'Sadly', 'discover', 'will', 'not', 'realize', 'childhood', 'dream', 'marrying', 'gay', 'violin', 'teacher', 'Talk', 'spoiling', 'fun', 'comedy', 'character', 'older', 'sister', 'Jool', 'who', '15', 'years', 'old', '20', 'illegally', 'work', 'bar', 'wear', 'revealing', 'leather', 'outfits', 'date', 'men', 'twenties', 'thirties', 'However', 'physically-advanced', 'appearance', 'having', 'mentality', '8', 'year', 'old', 'schizophrenic', 'can', 'skwinch', 'face', 'simultaneous', 'frown', 'smile', 'sighs', 'same', 'time', 'easy', 'feat', 'nearly', 'scene', 'reaction', 'event', 'alone', 'should', 'have', 'won', 'type', 'acting', 'award', 'Razzie.Next', 'Bailey', '24', 'year', 'old', 'high', 'school', 'junior', 'often', 'referred', 'Bay', 'why', 'do', ""n't"", 'just', 'dump', 'body', 'San', 'Francisco', 'Bay', 'funny', 'supposedly', 'soft', 'caring', 'one', 'group', 'most', 'time', 'yelling', 'everyone', 'Everyone', 'else', 'too', 'finally', 'virginity', '20-something', 'high', 'school', 'drug', 'addict', 'one', 'else', 'not', 'too', 'smart', 'very', 'smart', 'asking', 'Bay', 'how', 'fast', 'Jeep', 'went', 'hey', 'not', 'Ferrari', 'draw', 'attention', 'gut-busting', 'comedic', 'turn', 'much', 'time', 'trying', 'dump', 'yet', 'always', 'back', 'cuz', 'see', 'now', 'whipped', 'Later', 'instead', 'checking', 'rehab', 'out', 'permanently', 'Just', 'say', 'no', 'top', 'rung', 'ladder', 'Charlie', 'always', 'been', 'loser', 'normally', 'everything', 'apparently', 'due', 'birth', 'defect', 'resulting', 'brain', 'being', 'lodged', 'pants', 'giving', 'women', 'problems', 'Not', 'kind', 'woman', 'problems', 'Clod', 'discovers', 'problems', 'particular', 'woman', 'past', 'women', 'love', 'other', 'fight', 'several', 'episodes', 'finally', 'fight', 'more', 'ca', ""n't"", 'write', 'funnier', 'stuff', 'time', 'when', 'Charlie', 'decision', 'move', 'Seattle', 'actually', 'make', 'something', 'others', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'go', 'Then', 'decide', 'will', 'go', 'Charlie', 'backed', 'business', 'deal', 'spare', 'hassle', 'Clod', 'giving', 'up', 'violin', ""n't"", 'want', 'play', 'anymore', 'anyway', 'B', 'Jool', 'giving', 'up', 're-tread', 'boyfriend', 'C', 'Bay', 'just', 'giving', 'up.There', 'adage', 'Hollywood', 'not', 'working', 'children', 'pets', 'comedic', 'disregard', 'producers', 'put', 'lethargic', 'panting', 'dog', 'named', 'Thurber', 'show', 'also', 'baby', 'named', 'Owen', 'played', 'three', 'sets', 'twins', 'not', 'once.A', 'few', 'other', 'highlights', 'include', 'Jool', 'spending', '800', 'bucks', 'model', 'photography', 'apparently', 'ending', 'up', 'photo', 'new', 'photograph', 'frames', 'Clod', 'violin', 'teacher', 'touch', 'feminine', 'side', 'become', 'mother', 'adopting', 'new-born', 'baby', 'Too', 'numerous', 'itemize', 'are', 'instances', 'sticking', 'noses', 'where', 'do', ""n't"", 'belong', 'saying', 'silly', 'things', 'never', 'ever', 'taking', 'hint.Overall', 'did', 'shed', 'tear', 'buying', 'Seriously', ""'m"", 'surprised', 'made', 'pilot', 'good', 'many', 'people', 'apparently', 'got', 'something', 'pain', 'suffering', 'should', 'not', 'go', 'waste', 'appreciate', 'effort', 'went', 'show', 'not', 'result.DVD', 'extras', 'include', '3', 'cast', 'commentaries', 'are', 'quite', 'sparse', 'mostly', 'giggles', 'co-producer', 'commentaries', 'are', 'little', 'better', 'collection', 'short', 'cast/crew', 'comments', 'was', 'passable']",N/A

807670,A2BNNU4ELFKK4N,B0001IN0T4,MollyRK,"[5, 5]","I never really got into this show when it was enjoying its six-year run on television; when it began in 1994, I was 9 years old and didn't jump onto the Party of Five wagon the way my two older sisters did. But since I am a DVD fanatic and have heard nothing but wonderful things about this show, I decided to introduce myself to it through this DVD release, and all I can say is WOW.Party of Five strikes a chord that can't even be put into words. After going through the Season One episodes, all I can say is that this is just an amazing, amazing masterpiece and a credit to contemporary television. When you look at today's TV in retrospective, very few programs (and I mean VERY few) even dare to step into the territory that Party of Five does. You have these five siblings who suddenly must cope with their parents' death and band together in a way they never thought possible as they create a new little family for themselves, all while having to grapple with the everyday pressures of life and growing up: drinking, drugs, friends, peer pressure, etc....Okay, maybe that sounds a little too cliche, but once you get into this show you'll realize that it's far from that. In the Salinger family you've got 23-year-old Charlie who, instead of having the time of his life being a young man just starting out in the adult world, must move back home and take care of his younger siblings while struggling to build some level of order and authority as a newfound ""parent."" High school junior Bailey maintains a respectable role as the sensitive one in the family but still fights to keep his head above water with school and relationships. Sophomore Julia, who is a 16-year-old girl clearly in need of her mother at this time, is a bit rebellious and often comes across as very selfish, but in the end she is every bit as family-oriented as the others. 11-year-old Claudia is a gifted violinist--an inquisitive and precocious young girl who keeps her siblings' eyes looking around and about and has even been known to ""save the day"" for them all in some pretty intense ways. Finally, there is baby Owen, who is probably one of the biggest reasons the family is staying together--to help raise him and, in turn, each other.So, in short, this is who the Salingers are. Sound pretty intense? Just wait until they get into some of the storylines. One of the things that impressed me the most about this show is that it stands ahead of so many others in its realism. Many shows that focus on current adolescence try their hardest, but they simply cannot display the kind of accuracy in emotions that remains true to life. Party of Five is an amazing exception. There is nothing too cheesy, saccharine or overdone here; the underlying message is the importance and love of family, but that doesn't mean you're not going to see a group of human kids who make mistakes, get angry at one another, and occasionally do a few things they'll regret. They all go through periods of self-centeredness and isolation from time to time, but what it all comes down to is that they are conveying a type of reliance and steadfast love that all ages of people can watch with due integrity to the show's content.Another thing you'll want to know when you're watching these episodes is that the emotions presented sure as heck are not ""kiddie stuff."" Just think about it--when you have a 23-year-old man, two classic adolescents, a pre-teen little girl and a baby dealing with the loss of their mother and father, you are bound to get something pretty huge. Party of Five goes all the way with this; the drama is incredible, and with this first season it is so beautifully done that you feel so emotionally drained episode upon episode. It doesn't stop; it just keeps going, and you become so locked into this family's situation that you're hooked. Episodes like ""Thanksgiving"" and ""Ideas of March"" are just absolutely relentless, and you wonder how any show could possibly be so courageous and take that leap of faith with an audience. Discussing the types of things that these kinds of episodes do will either reel in or scare off viewers, and to me that is incredible bravery. Then there are those little moments when Owen takes his first steps (how often are the brothers and sisters the ones to really celebrate that milestone with you?) and Claudia plays her violin for Owen in the hospital. With things like that, you really catch onto the tone that you're going to get: an intense, family-focused show that drives in these separated emotions and meshes them into one as you get a small taste of what real life might be like, even if it's just a TV show.All the young actors do a fantastic job in their roles and allow plenty of room for something truly special. While many of us can't even imagine what it's like to mix the death of your parents with the added pressures of growing up, the characters hold an amazing truth and emotional accuracy that allows us to empathize. I apologize for making this a bit too long, but this is simply the greatest show I've ever witnessed, and I can't believe I almost missed it. It really is ""the best show that nobody is watching,"" and I can't wait for Seasons 2-6 to be released.
