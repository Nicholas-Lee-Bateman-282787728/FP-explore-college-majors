I hated those movies, but at least, in those movies the emotions the characters exhibited had some kind of rationale to it. Here the emotions are totally disconnected from reality, have nothing to do with what is going on in the screen, and seem only to be there to move the plot, if there is one, along.Katia, the girl, who seems quite psycotic if you ask me, keeps getting angry for no reason whatsoever; for instance, she entices pair of dogs to follow their moving car, then gets p#$sed at her boyfriend, when he hits one of them. By the time the movie approaches its dismal end, I did not care anymore how the director was going to wrap it up.The DVD includes a ""Director's note of intent"" (always a bad sign) A mix of Felliniesque dialog, blended with Sun Tzu; not a good combination. At the end of the ""note of intent"" the director finishes with ""Envisage this film only in relation to the means employed and so only work from instinct""Well, instinct will not get you a viewable movie; I don't think you could make a worse movie, if you were trying to achieve it.

Then I began to think `it's been a while since I have seen Zabriski Point'. I thought ` this is like it without the plot'. `or the violence'. Then I thought `Fassbimder with nudity'. Then I thought `this is doing sex the best way, the way they use to in the Seventies'. Then I thought `remember that French flick, A Very Young Girl, this is like that. There was another French movie maybe called Fat Girl that was about two sisters. This is also like it. I didn't realize how much, as I started writing this before the movie was over. I did think that there were situations resembling life. There were conversations where you wanted to jump in and say `look he said this but she did that'. But of course life's not like that and in that way it was sorta real. Before I knew what was happening I was starting to think about Funny Games. If you should happen to have liked this movie, I STRONGLY suggest you check out what's swimming in the deep end and see Funny Games. Most though I would tell to avoid either movie as they are not your typical cup of tea. Anyway, I think all the stuff I mentioned was liberally lifted from and if you connect with any of them, you could give this one a try.

This film was challenging, ambiguous, and disturbing, so there are lots of differing opinions on it. It's open to interpretation in a lot of ways.The main characters in the film are not very interesting or likable people. They're like many of the people we all have in the periphery of our lives: they're self-absorbed, bland, not particularly nice but not so hostile that they really stand out. They seem to be together for reasons that some might call ""the wrong reasons"" but are reasons that bring many people together anyway: he thinks she's hot and likes having sex with her, and she seems like the type of woman who needs a man to validate her. Aside from sexual attraction and neediness, there seems to be very little genuine affection or respect between the two of them. He thinks she's a hysterical, childish little girl, and she thinks he's a heartless, insensitive prick. Somehow the two interpret this as love.Through most of the film, the two engage in mundane activities, bicker, and have histrionic, almost animalistic sex. Although it's all very slow moving and tedious, the film does a good job of providing a sense of impending dread and doom. It's subtle, but palpable ... you know something very, very bad is coming.And it does. And when it does, it's brutal, horrifying, and fast.

The last half hour has a good night scene, and a shocking act of violence, but overall it's a pretentious, stupid film.  It consists of a very ugly couple (ugly on the inside mostly) screwing, yelling, screwing, and getting brutalised.  I am a fan of existential cinema, but this isn't a good example of it.  In fact, it's an embarrassment.  It's a shame, as the director, Bruno Dumont, previous film, L'humanite, is flatout amazing.  L'humanite had gotten some reviews from people thinking it's pretentious, slow (aka boring), and stupid, but it's a very powerful film with an incredible visual style to it.  This film isn't like that at all.  I think Dumont is a great filmmaker, but this is a bad misstep.  There seems to be a lot of posers out today making ""slow, ambiguous"" films in an attempt to be arty (there have always been posers of this kind throughout history, I suppose, so for us to think that they don't exist now is arrogance on our part).

Often, sudden and violent endings feel desperately tacked on so that audiences have something to talk about and distributors have something by which to sell the film.  In this case, however, the finale really causes you to reexamine the material.  Bruno calls this an experimental horror film; his interview and statement of purpose are a bit overly-grave and under deep-he repeats himself on but a few points and says very little beyond the idea that he thinks people are really animals.  Though that is basic stuff I give the benefit of the doubt to him and assume that we are getting a poor translation.  In short, I think the point of the film is better realized in this film itself than it is in Bruno's translated discussion of it.The demonstration of every human's vulnerability in this film is so graphically and unexpectedly rendered as to make it, in fact, one of the more terrifying films I've seen as an adult.  It doesn't mean to remind us of the monster in the closet or the monster in our own hearts so much as it means to remind us that we are flesh and blood exposed to all the monstrosities of the world, regardless the strength of our minds, the intelligence of our emotions.

They saw it and hated it, but unfortunately for them it was the only Greenaway film they had seen, so they sort of missed the point...actually, they didn't even get the context Greenaway was making his point in.  I suspect that is what's happened here.Twentynine Palms has a narrative and it is somewhat palpable to a mainstream audience...especially one that it is eager to be shocked. Dumont tells the story of Photographer David and his French girlfriend Katia having sex and examining the beautiful landscapes of southwestern United States after leaving Los Angeles. The pacing of the film and the pretty consistent nudity and sexual content allow us to engage the characters on an intimate level and sort of enjoy the peace, or at least silence, they exist in during this road trip (mind you this is not nearly as explicit as people say it is...its just two naked people who don't even look really great naked anyway).  They seem disconnected and somewhat isolated throughout.  It actually reaches a level of character depth I don't think dialogue can often reach...to me it's kind of the advantage movies have over other mediums.  The content during the film up to this point is what makes the film so real and believable and it did this without me really noticing its purpose.  Everything is pretty ordinary with these people, but why is Dumont showing us this?He is setting the stage for what turns out to be a very disruptive tragedy that befalls these two people.  The way we are set up is what makes the film so filthy and profoundly dark.  You have to really watch these characters the whole time to get the full effect, but I'm not so sure everyone in the audience wants this film to cut that deeply.  There is a clear a message here and every scene assists in giving the conclusion deeper meaning.Dumont has not created an anti-American film necessarily and he definitely doesn't set out to conquer Hollywood.  He's simply made a film that tries to simulate tragedy and gives us the rare opportunity to empathize.  This film is probably only really worth experiencing for a select few who can appreciate it.  The rest of us should probably pass.",4,Not For Everyone,1178064000,"05 2, 2007",2007,2773,"['Let', 'preface', 'saying', 'am', 'not', 'keenly', 'familiar', 'work', 'Bruno', 'Dumont', 'know', 'experimental', 'could', 'care', 'less', 'narrative', 'content', 'guidelines', 'fancy', 'indie', 'cred', 'get', 'guy', 'who', 'movies', 'own', 'terms', 'problem', 'one', 'films', 'attention', 'Twentynine', 'Palms', 'uninitiated', 'who', 'are', 'accustomed', 'more', 'conventional', 'movies', 'have', 'whole', 'bunch', 'people', 'pissing', 'misunderstood', 'work', 'think', 'conversation', 'had', 'film', 'student', 'Peter', 'Greenaway', 'Falls', 'saw', 'hated', 'unfortunately', 'was', 'only', 'Greenaway', 'film', 'had', 'seen', 'sort', 'missed', 'point', 'actually', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'get', 'context', 'Greenaway', 'was', 'making', 'point', 'suspect', 'what', 'happened', 'here.Twentynine', 'Palms', 'narrative', 'somewhat', 'palpable', 'mainstream', 'audience', 'especially', 'one', 'eager', 'be', 'shocked', 'Dumont', 'story', 'Photographer', 'David', 'French', 'girlfriend', 'Katia', 'having', 'sex', 'examining', 'beautiful', 'landscapes', 'southwestern', 'United', 'States', 'leaving', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'pacing', 'film', 'pretty', 'consistent', 'nudity', 'sexual', 'content', 'allow', 'engage', 'characters', 'intimate', 'level', 'sort', 'enjoy', 'peace', 'least', 'silence', 'exist', 'road', 'trip', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'explicit', 'people', 'say', 'just', 'two', 'naked', 'people', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'look', 'really', 'great', 'naked', 'anyway', 'seem', 'disconnected', 'somewhat', 'isolated', 'actually', 'level', 'character', 'depth', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'dialogue', 'can', 'often', 'reach', 'kind', 'advantage', 'movies', 'have', 'other', 'mediums', 'content', 'film', 'up', 'point', 'what', 'film', 'so', 'real', 'believable', 'did', 'really', 'noticing', 'purpose', 'Everything', 'pretty', 'ordinary', 'people', 'why', 'Dumont', 'showing', 'setting', 'stage', 'what', 'out', 'be', 'very', 'disruptive', 'tragedy', 'two', 'people', 'way', 'are', 'set', 'up', 'what', 'film', 'so', 'filthy', 'profoundly', 'dark', 'have', 'really', 'watch', 'characters', 'whole', 'time', 'get', 'full', 'effect', ""'m"", 'not', 'so', 'sure', 'everyone', 'audience', 'film', 'cut', 'deeply', 'clear', 'message', 'here', 'scene', 'assists', 'giving', 'conclusion', 'deeper', 'meaning.Dumont', 'not', 'created', 'anti-American', 'film', 'necessarily', 'definitely', ""n't"", 'set', 'out', 'conquer', 'Hollywood', 'simply', 'made', 'film', 'simulate', 'tragedy', 'rare', 'opportunity', 'empathize', 'film', 'probably', 'only', 'really', 'worth', 'experiencing', 'select', 'few', 'who', 'can', 'appreciate', 'rest', 'should', 'probably', 'pass']",Twentynine Palms
838828,A3MLO4GAD2O9DL,B0002KQNPO,"LGwriter ""SharpWitGuy""","[3, 5]","Lots of reviews of this film have noted its pointlessness and in all fairness, there's a lot of truth to these reviews. One of the most grating things is the director's incredibly high-falutin' ostensibly philosophical explanation/description of what he was trying to do when he made the movie, which he ""reveals"" (for lack of a better term) in an interview. Unfortunately, it's very pretentious sounding.That being said, there's an interesting parallel here to another ""two souls lost in a huge barren place"" movie, ""Gerry"" by Gus Van Sant. ""Gerry"" is a really interesting film, I think, and there are some intriguing similarities. But the Van Sant film really probes its two same-named characters, while the Domont film, ""Twentynine Palms"" spends a lot of time with its two characters engaged in back and forth stuff.So why the three stars? Good question. The back and forth stuff consists of alternating bickering and sex and, at least for me, it felt like there was some weird kind of atmosphere building up as a result of this. As in the Van Sant film, there are fairly long stretches of the two characters traveling (in ""Gerry"", by foot; in ""Twentynine Palms"", by car) with little else happening. It's during the traveling that we feel the complete emptiness of the relationship. The reason, though, that I gave ""Gerry"" four stars is that the relationship has some depth, is palpable, emotionally reverberates, while in the Dumont film, that's not the case.In spite of this pronounced shallowness, though, there's something going on and it ain't good. There IS a slowly creeping malaise that you do begin to feel, minute by minute, and in fact, I think Dumont does a reasonably good job at this.The problem is that this creeping malaise is shattered with a double blast (not literally a blast, as in shotgun, but referring to an outburst) of violence at the end of the film, making it, I would say, not so much pointless, but more like a huge doofy cartoon. The cartoonishness in particular is emphasized in the totally bizarre getup one of the characters sports in the penultimate scene.It kind of feels like the reason Dumont chose this really wacked out ending was to emphasize how America is the land of random personal violence. But the problem with that is, that point's already been made in a bunch of films. I think what he should have done is to build on the creepiness he started and instead of hitting us over the head with an outrageously cartoonish ending, move the characters to some kind of bizarre climax that much more naturally develops as a result of the buildup. I guess he just couldn't control himself.Too bad. This really should have, I would say, two and a half stars, but maybe I was feeling generous. The creepiness is done relatively well. But the ending totally destroys it.",3,Surreal movie with a wacked ending,1181692800,"06 13, 2007",2007,2808,"['Lots', 'reviews', 'film', 'have', 'noted', 'pointlessness', 'fairness', 'lot', 'truth', 'reviews', 'One', 'most', 'grating', 'things', 'director', 'incredibly', 'high-falutin', 'ostensibly', 'philosophical', 'explanation/description', 'what', 'was', 'trying', 'do', 'when', 'made', 'movie', 'reveals', 'lack', 'better', 'term', 'interview', 'Unfortunately', 'very', 'pretentious', 'sounding.That', 'being', 'said', 'interesting', 'parallel', 'here', 'two', 'souls', 'lost', 'huge', 'barren', 'place', 'movie', 'Gerry', 'Gus', 'Van', 'Sant', 'Gerry', 'really', 'interesting', 'film', 'think', 'are', 'intriguing', 'similarities', 'Van', 'Sant', 'film', 'really', 'probes', 'two', 'same-named', 'characters', 'Domont', 'film', 'Twentynine', 'Palms', 'lot', 'time', 'two', 'characters', 'engaged', 'back', 'forth', 'stuff.So', 'why', 'three', 'stars', 'Good', 'question', 'back', 'forth', 'stuff', 'alternating', 'bickering', 'sex', 'least', 'felt', 'was', 'weird', 'kind', 'atmosphere', 'building', 'up', 'result', 'Van', 'Sant', 'film', 'are', 'fairly', 'long', 'stretches', 'two', 'characters', 'traveling', 'Gerry', 'foot', 'Twentynine', 'Palms', 'car', 'little', 'else', 'happening', 'traveling', 'feel', 'complete', 'emptiness', 'relationship', 'reason', 'though', 'gave', 'Gerry', 'four', 'stars', 'relationship', 'depth', 'palpable', 'emotionally', 'Dumont', 'film', 'not', 'case.In', 'spite', 'pronounced', 'shallowness', 'though', 'something', 'going', 'ai', ""n't"", 'good', 'slowly', 'creeping', 'malaise', 'do', 'begin', 'feel', 'minute', 'minute', 'fact', 'think', 'Dumont', 'reasonably', 'good', 'job', 'this.The', 'problem', 'creeping', 'malaise', 'shattered', 'double', 'blast', 'not', 'literally', 'blast', 'shotgun', 'referring', 'outburst', 'violence', 'end', 'film', 'making', 'would', 'say', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'pointless', 'more', 'huge', 'doofy', 'cartoon', 'cartoonishness', 'particular', 'emphasized', 'totally', 'bizarre', 'getup', 'one', 'characters', 'sports', 'penultimate', 'scene.It', 'kind', 'feels', 'reason', 'Dumont', 'chose', 'really', 'wacked', 'out', 'ending', 'was', 'emphasize', 'how', 'America', 'land', 'random', 'personal', 'violence', 'problem', 'point', 'already', 'been', 'made', 'bunch', 'films', 'think', 'what', 'should', 'have', 'done', 'build', 'creepiness', 'started', 'instead', 'hitting', 'head', 'outrageously', 'cartoonish', 'ending', 'move', 'characters', 'kind', 'bizarre', 'climax', 'much', 'more', 'naturally', 'result', 'buildup', 'guess', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'control', 'himself.Too', 'bad', 'really', 'should', 'have', 'would', 'say', 'two', 'half', 'stars', 'maybe', 'was', 'feeling', 'generous', 'creepiness', 'done', 'relatively', 'well', 'ending', 'totally']",Twentynine Palms

First it bored us to death with long, untrimmed scenes, seemingly about not too much.But I didn't think a film that had indulged itself as much as this one would fail to provide a decent payoff at the end.Well, the film paid off all right.A lot of what seems to be aimless ballast in the film turns out to have informed the shocking ending.This guy who looks and acts like Travis Bickel in Taxi Driver, has a lust for sex even Travis, despite his pent up violence, does not display.Not that the girl wasn't mostly game, though she complained about the underwater sex act in the motel swimming pool. She said her boyfriend ""hurt"" her.A group of marines jump into the pool. 'Travis' then asks Katie if he would still be acceptable if he shaved his head like the raucous marines. She said he would NOT be acceptable, but the marines were ""very handsome."" This is a very ambivalent response to a pretty jealous boyfriend. The hair theme is pronounced in the film. It is a manlihood issue for 'Travis.' At one point Katie asks Jim what he uses on his hair. He doesn't answer.The Marine discussion is one in a long series of actions, sex play and significant dialog between the couple that inform the violent end of the film.'Travis' is ambivalent and a little jealous of those marines that broke up the tryst in the pool. Both the raucous marines and the jealousy theme echo in the rape scene near the end and the devastating Tsunami-like backlash later in the motel room.There's a theme of isolation in the desert and in the two lovers' almost total separation from everyone as they wander from motel to desert and back again. The most extreme example of it is when the french-speaking Katy leaves the motel after an argument with 'Travis,' but then is so terrified at just the approach of a car on the street, that she finds herself forced to return to her lover's 'custody.' Figure it out, though. This woman does not speak English, while he does, and would not be able to explain herself to desert denizens and Los Angelenos. She has to go back to him and probably isn't that happy about returning.At one point, the couple watches a father confess he had sex with their daughter to his wife on Jerry Springer. All along, Jim-'Travis' has been showing signs of abject soulessness in discussions with Katie. ""I feel sorry for her,""says Katie. ""For Who,"" asks Jim? ""The Mother,"" replies Katie. Then Katie asks Jim, ""would you do anything like that? ""Are you crazy,"" replies Jim, unconvincingly. Katie looks at Jim to try to divine whether he is lying. In the right circumstance Jim would have sex with his daughter. Jim turns and smiles. The move convinces Katie it is safe to leave Jim alone with her daughter should she ever have one.The storyteller is showing us that these two have opted away from civilized ways. In a way, they DESERVE what happens to them for wandering outside the boundaries of civilization. The uncivilized sexual play of the two in deserted and lonely places is still another indication that these two are asking for it. Indeed, their behavior contains the seeds of their destruction.Finally, there is a need to explain the final scene of a dead naked body in the desert while a lone policeman does a 360 around body and Hummer. There were two scenes in the hotel room, one of Travis stabbing Katie in a manner that mirrors physically what had happened to him in the desert. It should be noted that he has shaved his head in the way that Bickel did in Taxi Driver, a way that Katie has said she would not approve of on him, but WOULD APPROVE OF on the Marines in the pool. See the link between the thugs in the desert and the marines in the pool on the one hand, and the ironic sheering of Jim's own locks in the bathroom before his act of rage against Katie and the World. Jim is re-enacting exactly what happened to him in the desert, coiffed like the skinhead who raped him and the marines who made him jealous.There's the scene of Jim poised over Katie's lifeless corpse on the bed, then one of the corpse alone on the bed.So what is Jim doing out in the desert in the last scene? I think it is possible he went out looking for the guys in the white truck and found them. They then stripped him naked again and this time finished the job. A bigger likelihood is that Jim abandoned Katie's body in the motel, drove out to the exact place where he had been raped, and, partly in remorse and despair, partly out of hopelessness, cut his own throat with the same dull knife he first cut his hair with, and then offed Katie.This might be somewhat hard for some to admit. I'll bet I wasn't the only male who laughed at the irony when the skinhead pulled Jim's pants below his bare rear end and had a go at him.As Roxie Hart & Chorus explained in a stagey musical number in the movie Chicago: ""He Had It Comin'!""",3,So You Wondered What Happened to Scorcese's Taxi Driver,1114992000,"05 2, 2005",2005,4892,"['**Major', 'Spoilers**Twenty', 'Nine', 'Palms', 'was', 'hard', 'one', 'watch', 'First', 'bored', 'death', 'long', 'untrimmed', 'scenes', 'seemingly', 'not', 'too', 'much.But', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'film', 'had', 'indulged', 'as', 'much', 'one', 'would', 'fail', 'provide', 'decent', 'payoff', 'end.Well', 'film', 'paid', 'off', 'right.A', 'lot', 'what', 'be', 'aimless', 'ballast', 'film', 'out', 'have', 'informed', 'shocking', 'ending.This', 'guy', 'who', 'Travis', 'Bickel', 'Taxi', 'Driver', 'lust', 'sex', 'even', 'Travis', 'pent', 'up', 'violence', 'not', 'display.Not', 'girl', 'was', ""n't"", 'mostly', 'game', 'complained', 'underwater', 'sex', 'act', 'motel', 'swimming', 'pool', 'said', 'boyfriend', 'hurt', 'her.A', 'group', 'marines', 'jump', 'pool', 'then', 'Katie', 'would', 'still', 'be', 'acceptable', 'shaved', 'head', 'raucous', 'marines', 'said', 'would', 'NOT', 'be', 'acceptable', 'marines', 'were', 'very', 'handsome', 'very', 'ambivalent', 'response', 'pretty', 'jealous', 'boyfriend', 'hair', 'theme', 'pronounced', 'film', 'manlihood', 'issue', ""'Travis"", 'one', 'point', 'Katie', 'Jim', 'what', 'hair', ""n't"", 'answer.The', 'Marine', 'discussion', 'one', 'long', 'series', 'actions', 'sex', 'play', 'significant', 'dialog', 'couple', 'violent', 'end', 'film', 'ambivalent', 'little', 'jealous', 'marines', 'broke', 'up', 'tryst', 'pool', 'raucous', 'marines', 'jealousy', 'theme', 'echo', 'rape', 'scene', 'end', 'devastating', 'Tsunami-like', 'backlash', 'later', 'motel', 'theme', 'isolation', 'desert', 'two', 'lovers', 'almost', 'total', 'separation', 'everyone', 'wander', 'motel', 'desert', 'back', 'again', 'most', 'extreme', 'example', 'when', 'french-speaking', 'Katy', 'motel', 'argument', ""'Travis"", 'then', 'so', 'terrified', 'just', 'approach', 'car', 'street', 'forced', 'return', 'lover', ""'custody"", 'Figure', 'out', 'though', 'woman', 'not', 'speak', 'English', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'able', 'explain', 'desert', 'denizens', 'Los', 'Angelenos', 'go', 'back', 'probably', ""n't"", 'happy', 'returning.At', 'one', 'point', 'couple', 'father', 'confess', 'had', 'sex', 'daughter', 'wife', 'Jerry', 'Springer', 'All', 'along', ""Jim-'Travis"", 'been', 'showing', 'signs', 'abject', 'soulessness', 'discussions', 'Katie', 'feel', 'sorry', 'Katie', 'Who', 'Jim', 'Mother', 'Katie', 'Then', 'Katie', 'Jim', 'would', 'do', 'anything', 'Are', 'crazy', 'Jim', 'unconvincingly', 'Katie', 'Jim', 'try', 'divine', 'lying', 'right', 'circumstance', 'Jim', 'would', 'have', 'sex', 'daughter', 'Jim', 'smiles', 'move', 'Katie', 'safe', 'leave', 'Jim', 'alone', 'daughter', 'should', 'ever', 'have', 'one.The', 'storyteller', 'showing', 'two', 'have', 'opted', 'away', 'civilized', 'ways', 'way', 'DESERVE', 'what', 'wandering', 'boundaries', 'civilization', 'uncivilized', 'sexual', 'play', 'two', 'deserted', 'lonely', 'places', 'still', 'indication', 'two', 'are', 'asking', 'Indeed', 'behavior', 'seeds', 'destruction.Finally', 'need', 'explain', 'final', 'scene', 'dead', 'naked', 'body', 'desert', 'lone', 'policeman', '360', 'body', 'Hummer', 'were', 'two', 'scenes', 'hotel', 'room', 'one', 'Travis', 'stabbing', 'Katie', 'manner', 'mirrors', 'physically', 'what', 'had', 'happened', 'desert', 'should', 'be', 'noted', 'shaved', 'head', 'way', 'Bickel', 'did', 'Taxi', 'Driver', 'way', 'Katie', 'said', 'would', 'not', 'approve', 'WOULD', 'APPROVE', 'OF', 'Marines', 'pool', 'See', 'link', 'thugs', 'desert', 'marines', 'pool', 'one', 'hand', 'ironic', 'sheering', 'Jim', 'own', 'locks', 'bathroom', 'act', 'rage', 'Katie', 'World', 'Jim', 're-enacting', 'exactly', 'what', 'happened', 'desert', 'coiffed', 'skinhead', 'who', 'raped', 'marines', 'who', 'made', 'scene', 'Jim', 'poised', 'Katie', 'lifeless', 'corpse', 'bed', 'then', 'one', 'corpse', 'alone', 'bed.So', 'what', 'Jim', 'doing', 'out', 'desert', 'last', 'scene', 'think', 'possible', 'went', 'out', 'looking', 'guys', 'white', 'truck', 'found', 'then', 'stripped', 'naked', 'again', 'time', 'finished', 'job', 'A', 'bigger', 'likelihood', 'Jim', 'abandoned', 'Katie', 'body', 'motel', 'drove', 'out', 'exact', 'place', 'where', 'had', 'been', 'raped', 'partly', 'remorse', 'despair', 'partly', 'hopelessness', 'cut', 'own', 'throat', 'same', 'dull', 'knife', 'first', 'cut', 'hair', 'then', 'offed', 'Katie.This', 'might', 'be', 'somewhat', 'hard', 'admit', ""'ll"", 'bet', 'was', ""n't"", 'only', 'male', 'who', 'laughed', 'irony', 'when', 'skinhead', 'pulled', 'Jim', 'pants', 'bare', 'rear', 'end', 'had', 'go', 'him.As', 'Roxie', 'Hart', 'Chorus', 'explained', 'stagey', 'musical', 'number', 'movie', 'Chicago', 'Had', 'Comin']",Twentynine Palms
