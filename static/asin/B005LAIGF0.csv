1464044,A30N4CJVI6U4XE,B005LAIGF0,"Chris Wilson ""Chris Kent""","[12, 12]","As a child on a family trip in the 1970s, I saw a motorcycle speed past with a teenage couple. A car was making a u-turn and the motorcycle slammed into it, the teenagers taking flight onto the cement. I screamed and my parents stopped to assist the pair, who were sitting on the road, faces and jeans covered in blood. The kids were fine, but I have never forgotten the traumatic scene. I was reminded of this when watching ""Margaret,"" Kenneth Lonergan's epic 2011 film, as seemingly out of nowhere a similar incident takes place on the streets of New York City. One of life's mysteries is the unexpected emergence of tragedy, appearing as rapidly as the funnel of a tornado. Sometimes no one is to blame, a terrible truth difficult to grasp.When viewing ""Margaret"" for the first time, I was fortunate to have no preconceived notions. Its unique structure created a rare sensation of being unable to predict the outcome. This is a brilliant masterpiece, audacious and deeply inspired. Longeran, the writer and director, has dared to be great with the kind of project reminiscent of filmmakers of the 1970s. As I later learned, ""Margaret"" was filmed in 2004, but Lonergan became obsessed in the editing room, unable to achieve a final cut. Lonergan was trapped by a maddening vision in the great tradition of Sam Peckinpah (Major Dundee), Francis Ford Coppola (Apocalypse Now [HD]) and Werner Herzog (Fitzcarraldo). Such a quest produces the kind of art ""Margaret"" represents. Ahab goes after a whale. Herzog transports a boat. Lonergan, an unlikely existential madman, goes after life's meaning in post-911 New York.Okay, so this film remained in hiatus for years, finally reaching theaters in 2011. I knew none of this when viewing it, and was stunned by unexpected greatness. Lonergan's previous film wasYou Can Count On Me, a wonderfully-acted independent drama perhaps a tad overrated. And then came ""Margaret,"" and Lonergan may well have destroyed his career. No matter, this film plays like Chekhov, a visionary work with many questions and few answers. I'm amazed by the negative reviews and realize critics were aware of the film's troubled background. Luckily, I was blissfully ignorant.In one of the great performances, Anna Pacquin plays Lisa Cohen, a budding high school teenager who fatefully witnesses urban tragedy. She represses the trauma and for the remainder of the 150-minute film (another version runs three hours) she attempts to come to terms with its deadly consequences. The trauma festers, bubbling to the surface in fits of anguish. Pacquin's character, tortured by guilt, wants to do the right thing even if there is no clear answer as to what is ""right."" Lonergan is perhaps creating a parable for the New York terrorist attacks, followed by America's war with Iraq, or viewers can take it for something else -- a coddled though clever New York teen in serious need of therapy.But the film is so well made, I'm of the belief Lonergan was on to something. Perhaps one of the hard truths of life is our own insignificance within the universe, where unexpected tragedy can strike at any time. We have no power over such occurrences, and justice oftentimes does not exist. Once such a truth is realized, have we lost the innocence of childhood? If this sounds like a brooding novel, that's because ""Margaret"" plays like one.It's difficult to categorize this drama, but I was reminded of the works of Michael Haneke (The Michael Haneke Collection (The Piano Teacher/Funny Games/Code Unknown/The Castle/Benny's Video/The Seventh Continent/71 Fragments of a Chronology of Chance) (7pc),The White Ribbon [Blu-ray],Cache (Hidden)). One of our greatest living directors by way of Austria, his morose films never follow convenient paths, with shocking violence erupting at unexpected moments. His thought-provoking dramas are as unsettling as a Droog humming Beethoven. Lonergan has dared to tread similar turf.""Margaret"" is supported by an extraordinary ensemble cast including Mark Ruffalo, Jean Reno, Matt Damon, Matthew Broderick, Kieran Culkin and Rosemarie DeWitt, each with crucial moments providing layers to this complicated film. An added note must be made about the performances of J. Smith Cameron, as Lisa's mother, and Jeannie Berlin, as an elder friend who becomes Lisa's uneasy confidante. These essentially unknown actresses give searing portrayals in difficult, unwieldy roles. Lonergan's film shocked me, not just because of its emotional truth, but because of its tenacious refusal to follow any kind of convention common in films today.

1464047,A2Z74B902BZVC1,B005LAIGF0,Daniel Gamboa,"[2, 7]","This film is two and a half hours about an inmature and mean-spirited teenager called Lisa. I don't have a problem with the cinematography or the acting, which are very good (Ana Paquin's peformance alone is worth watching, thus the three stars); I just have a problem with the plot.Paquin's character, Lisa, lies to the police about an accident that she is almost entirely to blame, and then she gets upset and does whatever she can to get Ruffalo, the bus driver, fired because she feels guilty for causing the accident. I don't mind watching films about such characters, but to make her look as if she has nothing but good intentions and trying to get the viewer to feel for her and understand her? That's just absurd. More absurd is when she goes to the police to change her statement, and the police instead of dismissing her for being not only a minor but a liar, pay attention to her all along and tell her they will see what they can do for her. Are we supposed to feel sorry and sympathize with Lisa? What kind of police department is this? She admitted she lie and then wants to tell the truth and the police don't even bother making her see what's wrong about this?In addition, what's the deal with all the random and forced class discussions that have nothing to do with anything? Class discussions about September 11, the war in Irak, and the Nazi and the Jewish are thrown in to make the movie thought provoking despite the fact that none of this has anything to do with anything. Or I guess that the film is trying to make Lisa look as if she is somebody who cares about current events and history and has a brain and an opinion of her own. Or the writer is trying to compare Lisa's own guilty feelings and justification for her acts to those of people involved in WWII, the war in Irak and September 11. I don't know, whatever is the case, I found it random and forced. Without this, I probably would have liked the movie better.There's also an array of characters that are far from being likable, and which makes you understand why Lisa is the way she is. Culkin taking her virginity, Reno's boring personality, Broderick feeling threatened by a student who has a brain, Lisa's self-absorbed and selfish parents, Monica's mildly deranged friend, the Mickey Mouse Law school young lawyer who seemed to have missed class that day to meet Lisa and Monica's friend at a coffee shop to talk about the trial, etc.I only liked Monica's friend, for a moment, when she tells Lisa to stop thinking the world is a tragic play where she is the star and tells her to grow up and get out of her appartment. Finally, somebody showed to have some sense at least for a couple of minutes in the film.Matt Damon's character being seduced by Lisa is the icing on the cake. After Lisa has sex with him, her math teacher, she approaches him when he is, I am assuming, with his girlfriend or another teacher, and tells them she just had an abortion, obviously hinting that the baby might have been Damon's and trying to get him in trouble. Of course, she didn't have any abortion, but this is good-spirited Lisa, once again, with her good intentions trying to sell sympathy while trying to get other people in trouble because she feels guilty. Again, are we supposed to feel sorry and sympathy for Lisa? She should've been run by the bus instead of Monica.I repeat, if a movie about such a character is going to be done, don't try to sell sympathy for her. This movie is about Lisa, a detestable character that makes you end up loathing this film.",3,Are we really supposed to sympathize with Lisa?,1345939200,"08 26, 2012",2012,3541,"['film', 'two', 'half', 'hours', 'inmature', 'mean-spirited', 'teenager', 'called', 'Lisa', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'problem', 'cinematography', 'acting', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'Ana', 'Paquin', 'peformance', 'alone', 'worth', 'watching', 'thus', 'three', 'stars', 'just', 'have', 'problem', 'plot.Paquin', 'character', 'Lisa', 'police', 'accident', 'almost', 'entirely', 'blame', 'then', 'upset', 'can', 'get', 'Ruffalo', 'bus', 'driver', 'fired', 'guilty', 'causing', 'accident', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'watching', 'films', 'such', 'characters', 'make', 'look', 'nothing', 'good', 'intentions', 'trying', 'get', 'viewer', 'feel', 'understand', 'just', 'absurd', 'More', 'absurd', 'when', 'police', 'change', 'statement', 'police', 'instead', 'dismissing', 'being', 'not', 'only', 'minor', 'liar', 'pay', 'attention', 'along', 'tell', 'will', 'see', 'what', 'can', 'do', 'Are', 'supposed', 'feel', 'sorry', 'sympathize', 'Lisa', 'What', 'kind', 'police', 'department', 'admitted', 'lie', 'then', 'tell', 'truth', 'police', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'bother', 'making', 'see', 'what', 'wrong', 'addition', 'what', 'deal', 'random', 'forced', 'class', 'discussions', 'have', 'nothing', 'do', 'anything', 'Class', 'discussions', 'September', '11', 'war', 'Irak', 'Nazi', 'Jewish', 'are', 'thrown', 'make', 'movie', 'thought', 'provoking', 'fact', 'none', 'anything', 'do', 'anything', 'guess', 'film', 'trying', 'make', 'Lisa', 'look', 'somebody', 'who', 'current', 'events', 'history', 'brain', 'opinion', 'own', 'writer', 'trying', 'compare', 'Lisa', 'own', 'guilty', 'feelings', 'justification', 'acts', 'people', 'involved', 'WWII', 'war', 'Irak', 'September', '11', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'case', 'found', 'random', 'forced', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'movie', 'better.There', 'also', 'array', 'characters', 'are', 'far', 'being', 'likable', 'understand', 'why', 'Lisa', 'way', 'Culkin', 'taking', 'virginity', 'Reno', 'boring', 'personality', 'Broderick', 'feeling', 'threatened', 'student', 'who', 'brain', 'Lisa', 'self-absorbed', 'selfish', 'parents', 'Monica', 'mildly', 'deranged', 'friend', 'Mickey', 'Mouse', 'Law', 'school', 'young', 'lawyer', 'who', 'seemed', 'have', 'missed', 'class', 'day', 'meet', 'Lisa', 'Monica', 'friend', 'coffee', 'shop', 'talk', 'trial', 'only', 'liked', 'Monica', 'friend', 'moment', 'when', 'Lisa', 'stop', 'thinking', 'world', 'tragic', 'play', 'where', 'star', 'grow', 'up', 'get', 'appartment', 'Finally', 'somebody', 'showed', 'have', 'sense', 'least', 'couple', 'minutes', 'film.Matt', 'Damon', 'character', 'being', 'seduced', 'Lisa', 'icing', 'cake', 'Lisa', 'sex', 'math', 'teacher', 'when', 'am', 'assuming', 'girlfriend', 'teacher', 'just', 'had', 'abortion', 'obviously', 'hinting', 'baby', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'Damon', 'trying', 'get', 'trouble', 'course', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'abortion', 'good-spirited', 'Lisa', 'once', 'again', 'good', 'intentions', 'trying', 'sell', 'sympathy', 'trying', 'get', 'other', 'people', 'trouble', 'guilty', 'Again', 'are', 'supposed', 'feel', 'sorry', 'sympathy', 'Lisa', 'should', ""'ve"", 'been', 'run', 'bus', 'instead', 'Monica.I', 'repeat', 'movie', 'character', 'going', 'be', 'done', 'do', ""n't"", 'try', 'sell', 'sympathy', 'movie', 'Lisa', 'detestable', 'character', 'end', 'up', 'loathing', 'film']",Margaret

I was reminded of several of Alexander Payne's films while watching, especially Election (1999). The two directors share a very similar moral vision: people are not as connected to each other (or as moral) as they might think, they tell stories so they feel connected to something (themselves maybe), but their stories just make them all the more aware of how isolated and compromised they really are. The films of both directors never end with any kind of resolution or redemption, they just end. I don't know that Lonergan is the more ambitious of the two, but he is certainly the more artsy (and by artsy I suppose I mean ambiguous). ""Margaret"" for instance is not the name of any character in the film, rather that is the name of a character in a Hopkins poem read aloud in an English class. The main character's name is Lisa, a high school senior, who experiences a traumatic event and becomes either a) so sensitive to the ongoing tragedies in the world around her that she ceases to think her own existence even matters, or, b) so callous that she cannot take pleasure in anything unless it inflicts harm upon others. Lisa switches back and forth between these extremes, sometimes in the course of single conversations. Its very difficult to say what the trauma has done to her or what kind of person Lisa is. You keep watching but its hard to know what to make of the character or the film. Even at 150 minutes, this still reads like the first chapter of a much longer work.

1464052,A3HM5G9IV1FTFP,B005LAIGF0,Douglas King,"[8, 9]","""Margaret"" was supposedly filmed 7-8 years ago, and for reasons I'm not sure of, sat on the shelf until finally a group of film critics advocated for its release. After watching it, I can understand why ... it's a difficult film, hard to categorize, but also rich, provocative and brilliant.The superficial storyline of the film involves a 17 year old girl, Lisa (Anna Paquin, looking much more natural than she does now in her toned, blond TrueBlood persona) who is indirectly involved in a fatal accident in which a woman is killed by a bus. Confused and guilt-ridden, she goes about trying to do the ""right thing,"" which in her mind involves making sure those responsible (including herself) are held accountable, as well as trying to get justice for the deceased. But at every turn, her effort is met with the ambivalence, apathy, and bureaucracy of the adult world.However, as much as the film follows this dramatic central storyline, the film is also a portrait of all the much more mundane and subtle predicaments of being 17 years old. Lisa is no longer a child, and no longer coddled like one. She is expected to behave like an adult, but at the same time the other adults in her life constantly remind her of her youth and inexperience at every turn. She's impulsive and emotional, but also insightful and self-aware. She also wants to explore and experiment, and is aware of the power of her youthful sexuality, but also quickly finds out the repercussions of it. Around her are the archetypes of the kind of people most of us probably had in our lives at her age: her mother who is equal parts self-absorbed, caring, and clingy; the goodhearted but awkward friend who wants to date her; the experienced bad boy who she finds much more interesting; the pathetic teacher who is more interested in holding onto his tiny source of hubris than exploring a student's genuine ideas; and sadly, the one well-meaning, compassionate adult in her life who she hurts just because she can.Paquin's performance is formidable, and would probably be award-worthy if it wasn't so old. The film itself, by alternating between high drama and subtle character exploration, serves as one of the best depictions of modern adolescence I've seen.

1464053,AOZGOFPVAUMTB,B005LAIGF0,Doug Park,"[7, 8]","{4.5 Stars}""Margaret"" plays like a good modern novel. The acting, script, and cinematography are incredibly realistic, and the story is intelligently presented without being overly artsy or high-brow.My take on it: After witnessing and being an unwitting participant in a tragic bus accident, bright, promising, but very frenetic NYC high school senior Lisa Cohen finds it harder than ever to find connection with anyone around her. Ironically, this prevents her from understanding why everyone around her has the same problem. As she says herself during one of the numerous altercations with her rising Broadway actress mother, ""People don't relate to each other. . . They're totally disconnected.""On this subject, there are a lot of people screaming at each other here, and they usually don't even recall how the screaming began. They always stop screaming before it gets really tiresome, but the fights are crucial to the theme of people just acting out with no attempt to understand or empathize. The very fine acting and dialogue prevent ""Margaret"" from descending into what it could have been: A hackneyed soap opera/New York melodrama of the sort we've seen plenty of times before.I found Lisa harder and harder to take as the film progressed. Sometimes it seemed that she should be a little less of a selfish ""drama queen,"" but, again, this negative development may be deliberate on the part of the creators and helps pose the question of who's really crazy and who's really sane.There is a slow, steady tension to this film, plenty of interesting stuff happens, and there are all kinds of meaningful subplots. It often seems to meander, but everything's relevant in the end. Yet, ""Margaret"" is driven more by its various themes than it is by plot or character. I like it because it's so different from most current films; in fact, it's the first recent film I've seen that I'll probably want to see again. Nevertheless, people who just want to be entertained without having to sit back and analyze what they're watching will probably not want to sit through 2.5 hours of this.",5,A Film to Take as You Will,1351987200,"11 4, 2012",2012,2085,"['4.5', 'Stars', 'Margaret', 'good', 'modern', 'novel', 'acting', 'script', 'cinematography', 'are', 'incredibly', 'realistic', 'story', 'intelligently', 'presented', 'being', 'overly', 'artsy', 'high-brow.My', 'take', 'witnessing', 'being', 'unwitting', 'participant', 'tragic', 'bus', 'accident', 'bright', 'promising', 'very', 'frenetic', 'NYC', 'high', 'school', 'senior', 'Lisa', 'Cohen', 'harder', 'ever', 'find', 'connection', 'anyone', 'Ironically', 'understanding', 'why', 'everyone', 'same', 'problem', 'one', 'numerous', 'altercations', 'rising', 'Broadway', 'actress', 'mother', 'People', 'do', ""n't"", 'relate', 'other', ""'re"", 'totally', 'disconnected', 'subject', 'are', 'lot', 'people', 'screaming', 'other', 'here', 'usually', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'recall', 'how', 'screaming', 'began', 'always', 'stop', 'screaming', 'really', 'tiresome', 'fights', 'are', 'crucial', 'theme', 'people', 'just', 'acting', 'out', 'attempt', 'understand', 'empathize', 'very', 'fine', 'acting', 'dialogue', 'prevent', 'Margaret', 'descending', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'hackneyed', 'soap', 'opera/New', 'York', 'melodrama', 'sort', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'plenty', 'times', 'before.I', 'found', 'Lisa', 'harder', 'harder', 'take', 'film', 'progressed', 'Sometimes', 'seemed', 'should', 'be', 'little', 'less', 'selfish', 'drama', 'queen', 'again', 'negative', 'development', 'may', 'be', 'deliberate', 'part', 'creators', 'pose', 'question', 'who', 'really', 'crazy', 'who', 'really', 'sane.There', 'slow', 'steady', 'tension', 'film', 'plenty', 'interesting', 'stuff', 'happens', 'are', 'kinds', 'meaningful', 'subplots', 'often', 'meander', 'everything', 'relevant', 'end', 'Margaret', 'driven', 'more', 'various', 'themes', 'plot', 'character', 'so', 'different', 'most', 'current', 'films', 'fact', 'first', 'recent', 'film', ""'ve"", 'seen', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'want', 'see', 'again', 'Nevertheless', 'people', 'who', 'just', 'want', 'be', 'entertained', 'having', 'sit', 'back', 'analyze', 'what', ""'re"", 'watching', 'will', 'probably', 'not', 'want', 'sit', '2.5', 'hours']",Margaret

1464055,A3V7K5L1134ZO3,B005LAIGF0,Dr. Sparkles,"[6, 7]","Basically this movie is about a teenage girl who plays a part in causing a grisly bus accident that kills a women.  The rest of the movie is spent showing how the girl deals with her guilt and confusion in various ways and how it impacts her decisions.  It does a good job of capturing that ""life goes on"" feel even when one is in the midst of horrible pain, guilt and indecision about how they should feel and what should they do.  It also shows how relationships can be impacted by a tragic event.  Margaret is ALOT of drama to take so be prepared.  The accident scene is extremely real and as close to what I might imagine an accident like that would really be like without hiding anything or sugar coating it.  Anna Paquin plays the snotty, intelligent, sometimes sweet, sometimes loving, distant, and overly-emotional teenage role to perfection.  One sometimes forgets that teenagers are all these things rolled into one and the complexity of that time in life is captured very well.  It also addresses teenage sexuality and the relationship between a divorced mother with a busy career raising her teenage daughter.  I really liked the reality, no-bs quality of Margaret.  Margaret tries to rectify what has happened but it's true that when something like that does happen, it just seems that whatever you are doing to try and help somehow isn't enough or you're just not sure what is the right thing to do.  Also swirling around the plot is a semi-legal drama about getting the bus driver fired which actually turns into something else that Anna Paquin's character was not expecting.  Admittedly at times I was annoyed with Paquin's aggressive, smart-aleckness and some of the drama was sort of corny, but all in all, this was a very different movie that was somewhat refreshing.  Dare I say something new here?  As most movies repeat old plots.  Bravo for Anna Paquin.  Once again, this is a HUGE dose of drama which might leave you feeling a little done with drama after you watch it - but that's okay.

1464059,A328S9RN3U5M68,B005LAIGF0,Grady Harp,"[15, 17]","MARGARET is and has been a troubled movie - sophisticated examination of one girl's post-traumatic transformation as part of a larger point about how one's notion of importance is dwarfed by the larger worldview. Written and directed by Kenneth Lonergan and shot in 2005 as a three-hour film, the movie has remained on the shelves since its completion in 2007 over legal problems and finally is available for viewing in a 150-minute version. Though it has flaws it contains some of the most sophisticated dialogue and philosophical points about where we are in our society today that the editing glitches become secondary background noise in a compelling film. The title (no one in the film is named Margaret) references the Gerald Manley Hopkins poem `Spring and Fall: to a young child' which is quoted at the top of this review.MARGARET focuses on a 17-year-old New York City high-school student Lisa (Anna Paquin) who feels certain that she inadvertently played a role in a traffic accident that has claimed a woman's life, Monica (Allison Janney): Lisa was chasing a bus whose driver Maretti (Mark Ruffalo) ran a red light because of Lisa's distraction trying to discover where the Maretti bought his cowboy hat. Monica dies in Lisa's arms while asking for her daughter also named Lisa (we later learn Monica's daughter died at age 12 from leukemia). Lisa at first feels sorry for Maretti, thinking that if she tells the truth Maretti will loose his job and his family support. Lisa's actress mother Joan (J. Smith-Cameron) encourages her to not give accurate testimony to the police, a decision Lisa follows and spends the rest of the film regretting, and in making attempts to set things right she meets with opposition at every step. Torn apart with frustration, she begins emotionally brutalizing her family, her friends, her teachers, and most of all, herself. She has been confronted quite unexpectedly with a basic truth: that her youthful ideals are on a collision course against the realities and compromises of the adult world.The world that Lisa occupies includes teachers - played by Matt Damon (who crosses a forbidden line when Lisa seeks his advice as the only truly adult man she knows, Matthew Broderick whose class discussions over literature are brittle and acerbic and deeply disturbing - her introduction to adolescent needs and physical incidents at the hands of John Gallagher, Jr. (now of The Newsroom fame), Paul (Kieran Culkin) - her relationship with her needy single mother Joan whose newly dating Ramon (Jean Reno), her contact with the deceased's friend Emily (Jeannie Berlin - brilliant), and the deceased's only family - all in an attempt to somehow set things right but Lisa admitting that she is as responsible for Monica's death as is Maretti.  But the world outside can't cope with anything but financial compensation as the resolution to Lisa's angst.There are many other characters brought to life by some VERY fine actors and the stunning musical score by Nico Muhly includes moments at the Metropolitan Opera where we actually get to see and hear Christine Goerke as Bellini's Norma singing `Casta Diva' and Ren&eacute;e Fleming and Susan Graham singing the Barcarolle from Offenbach's Tales of Hoffman, allowing the opening and closing of the film to be accompanied by a quiet guitar piece, as well as proving Muhly's very highly accomplished music to underscore the moods of the film. The cinematography by Ryszard Lenczewski underlines the tension - form the imagery of slow motion crowd movement in New York during the opening sequences to the stabilization of important encounters between the characters.  A lot is said and screamed and the level of communication and actions by Anna Paquin's Lisa alienate the audience at times, but the film makes some very solid statements about how we are acidly interacting or not connecting in our current state of society.  That deserves attention. The film requires a lot form the audience, but in this viewer's mind it is well worth the time.

It's hard to think of a major theme of human existence that is not explored in this movie.  What it's mostly about is a teenage girl's confrontation with mortality.  The title comes from a beautiful poem by Gerard Manley Hopkins called ""Spring and Fall,"" which is read in the film by Matthew Broderick, playing Anna Paquin's high school English teacher:To a young childMargaret, are you grievingOver Goldengrove unleaving?Leaves, like the things of man, youWith your fresh thoughts care for, can you?Ah! as the heart grows olderIt will come to such sights colderBy and by, nor spare a sighThough worlds of wanwood leafmeal lie;And yet you will weep and know why.Now no matter, child, the name:Sorrow's springs are the same.Nor mouth had, no nor mind, expressedWhat heart heard of, ghost guessed:It is the blight man was born for,It is Margaret you mourn for.Even now as I read that poem and recall the powerful closing moments of the movie -- where Paquin weeps and knows why -- a tear comes to my eye.The film has an effortless realism.  The classroom scenes and the lawyers are pitch-perfect.  I mention them in particular, because movies usually get them wrong.  The depiction of smart teenagers (and teachers) -- what they say and how they say it -- is dead-on.  Every character is fully drawn.  You know them all, and empathize.  Some think the movie is too cluttered.  I suppose the Matt Damon subplot is the least successful -- at least in the theatrical cut -- but I did not find the movie overstuffed.

There is a  DVD version for sale which includes scenes cut from the theatrical release.This film review is based on the film's Instant View version of the film which seems to be the shorter version, clocking in at 2 and 1/2 hours.Potential viewers should know that lawsuits delayed release of the movie and DVD due to disputes with the producer, the screenwrier, etc. Could a 3 hour movie be cut to 2 and 1/2 hours and would that affect the movie's integrity and flow?Eventually, the movie was shortened, and (sadly) released in just two theaters.This film is worth seeing by so many more people than those who made it to those 2 theatres. Yes, the film has its flaws. But it is also a complex and thought- provoking exploration of the consequences of  life after witnessing a terrible accident and trying to grapple with doing the ""right thing.""Here are some reasons to watch this movie and the serious questions and issues facing potential viewers:Early on, a young woman, Lisa (played by Anna Paquin), witnesses a shocking tragedy, one where she feels involved and responsible (at least, in part). How would someone still evolving into adulthood face that? How would she react? This is a MAJOR focus of the movie and also one of the reasons people didn't like it. There is a lot of adolescent drama, often extended and intense. Some feel it goes on too long and stretches credibility.I confess that I was one of those who had issues with Lisa's endless drama and attempts to contact others affected by the tragic accident and push their boundaries. Her actions are  what another character labels as ""strident"", including Lisa's language, attitude, and inability to gauge the discomfort of those around her.But the interview I heard with Kenneth Lonergan (who appears in the film along with his wife) gave me a new perspective. I went back and watched the film again.And I rethought my first response and wondered: how would someone so young possibly react under the circumstances? How would a  college student's identity and emergence into adulthood be affected? What would be the range of reactions? These questions gave me pause. Perhaps what seems grating and even obnoxious in Lisa - and could turn off viewers- makes sense after all. It did to me - on my second viewing.Does the final scene at the opera, the point where films traditionally reach a resolution, mesh with all the events before then? I think it does, reflects Lisa's vulnerability. But I can see both sides of this.I also hope you watch Mark Ruffalo's performance as a bus driver linked with pivotal events. He is an actor who doesn't always get enough attention because his performances seem understated. But he is superb in this movie.I've left out so much.

She is touchy and peculiar in this film. She has a style of acting that is her own. The thing I related to was Lisa wanted the bus driver to feel some of her pain and guilt that she had experienced from the accident. She saw him as shut off and unemotional after the death of the walker. I think her life had changed dramatically after what she had witnessed. It triggered lots of anger in her dealings with others, especially, with mother and possible father figures. I felt something inside after her truth with how it was being settled. The things I liked in the film, I liked the channeling, the intelligence, the connections that she followed without much artifice, she dealt with people being blunt or negative without folding, it wasn't a colorful film but it was rich in a different way. I decided to write more on this film. Maybe the film wanted the viewer to see how a person can shut off from their world and set of experiences. Like the bus driver, he ultimately chose to push or not really connect with the trauma of the accident. We only see one point of connection of this driver, who knows what he does in the night with what happened to him that dark day. Maybe he crys to himself or he has nightmares, maybe he is coping with it the best he can, maybe he shuts off to the girl because he is afraid, afraid to show his vulnerability, maybe it hurts to much. Thats the thing with movies, we just see that frame not the whole life and the moments that make the total instead of just parts. Its sad because we tend to judge and don't really know the truth of a person. Well, thats what I think.

1464075,A3O8XFP3N8UP4H,B005LAIGF0,Michael,"[0, 0]","I saw Kenneth Lonergan's second film Margaret in New York City with a friend of mine at a small indie theater in January, 2012 and I was beyond surprised by it. It's very rare these days that I see a current film that is so powerful and haunting that I don't know what to make of it or how to take it in. Lonergan made the film in 2005 and it was scheduled to be released in 2007 but because of post production problems which resulted in a few lawsuits, it finally saw a small release in 2011 with very few theaters showing it. If things had worked out differently, this could have been a huge contender during award season. A film that deals with so many heavy themes and one that's very emotionally intense, I honestly don't know how to recommend this to someone. Not since Barry Lyndon (1975) have I seen something that has moved me this much. Anna Paquin has never been better than she is here. The performances are very real and the dialogue so authentic that it's overwhelming. Although it does have a few notable flaws, this is the best cinematic art of the past couple of years in my book and Lonergan being the most under appreciated contemporary director. Keep in mind that his preferred cut runs at over 3 hours long and just like the works of Stanley Kubrick, it does take its time.",5,Best film of the past couple of years.,1386892800,"12 13, 2013",2013,1294,"['saw', 'Kenneth', 'Lonergan', 'second', 'film', 'Margaret', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'friend', 'mine', 'small', 'indie', 'theater', 'January', '2012', 'was', 'surprised', 'very', 'rare', 'days', 'see', 'current', 'film', 'so', 'powerful', 'haunting', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'make', 'how', 'take', 'Lonergan', 'made', 'film', '2005', 'was', 'scheduled', 'be', 'released', '2007', 'post', 'production', 'problems', 'resulted', 'few', 'lawsuits', 'finally', 'saw', 'small', 'release', '2011', 'very', 'few', 'theaters', 'showing', 'things', 'had', 'worked', 'out', 'differently', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'huge', 'contender', 'award', 'season', 'film', 'so', 'many', 'heavy', 'themes', 'one', 'very', 'emotionally', 'intense', 'honestly', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'recommend', 'someone', 'Not', 'Barry', 'Lyndon', '1975', 'have', 'seen', 'something', 'moved', 'much', 'Anna', 'Paquin', 'never', 'been', 'better', 'here', 'performances', 'are', 'very', 'real', 'dialogue', 'so', 'authentic', 'overwhelming', 'have', 'few', 'notable', 'flaws', 'best', 'cinematic', 'art', 'past', 'couple', 'years', 'book', 'Lonergan', 'being', 'most', 'appreciated', 'contemporary', 'director', 'Keep', 'mind', 'preferred', 'cut', 'runs', '3', 'hours', 'long', 'just', 'works', 'Stanley', 'Kubrick', 'take', 'time']",Margaret
1464076,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,B005LAIGF0,M. Oleson,"[2, 3]","This was director Kenneth Lonergan second feature after a long break from the acclaimed ""You Can Count On Me"" from 2000.  He was also the writer and has the role of the father of the main character, Lisa (Anna Paquin).  The film was wrapped in 2005 but sat on the shelf when Lonergan and the studio couldn't agree on the final cut.  Lonergan started with a 4 hour version and whittled it down to 3 hours.  After years of legal wrangling, Martin Scorsese and his longtime editor Thelma Schoonmaker were brought in to take a crack.  Lonergan had worked with Scorsese on ""Gangs of New York.""  The movie was finally released in late 2011 for a brief money losing run.The Blu ray version I reviewed is 2 hours and 30 minutes, the same as the theatrical version but the package includes the 3 hour extended cut on a separate DVD, not Blu ray.  There are no extras on either disc.  The story is about a 17 year old ""rich Jewish girl"" played with an eye-opening performance by Paquin.  Love her or hate her, you won't forget her.  Out one day on the streets of NYC she spots a straw cowboy hat she wants.  The problem is that it sits on the head of a city bus driver (Mark Ruffalo).  Unable to get on the bus she chases him down the street waving for him to stop.  He thinks she's flirting so pays more attention to her than his driving and hits a pedestrian (Allison Janney).In a gut wrenching and elongated scene at the accident, Monica (Janney) dies in Lisa's arms.  When questioned by the police, Lisa makes eye contact with the driver who is being questioned at the same time.  When asked whether the bus had a green or red light, both lie and say green.  Now here is an irrefutable major plot point that would seem to be easily dismissed.  On a busy city street there were no other witnesses?  No traffic cameras?Putting that aside, Lisa's anguish and guilt spill over into her relationship with her mother, an actress in smallish theatrical productions.  She treats a potential boyfriend (John Gallagher Jr.) harshly, instead gives her virginity to a coke-snorting hot shot (Kieran Culkin).  In a social studies class Lisa engages in frequent debates with a Muslim sympathizer devolve into yelling matches that would make political talking heads proud.  In her English literature class one of her classmates goes on and on debating the teacher (Matthew Broderick) about what Shakespeare meant when writing one of his plays.  She flirts with her math teacher (Matt Damon).Lonergan spends a lot of time inside high school classrooms, clearly indicating the film is about the teenagers' transition from childhood to adulthood and the difficulty of the journey.  It is in the English class that Broderick's character reads a poem by 19th century author Gerard Manley Hopkins entitled ""Spring and Fall: To A Young Child.""  The child's name was Margaret.  This is a favorite poem of Lonergan's, given to him by a mentor, Patricia Broderick who is also Matthew's mother.As Lisa's guilt builds she tries to recant her original statement but is brushed off by the police (case is closed).  Frustrated she tracks down Monica's nearest relative, a cousin in Arizona who rarely spoke to her cousin.  Eventually she finds Monica's best friend, Emily played by Jeannie Berlin who hasn't been seen on the big screen since the 1970's (""The Heartbreak Kid"").  She is a real find and gives an award worth performance.  Emily is a perfect friend and foil for the still learning Lisa.  Together they form an alliance to bring a lawsuit to eventually get the bus driver fired.For the first 90 minutes I was totally enthralled with this production, but then Lonergan keeps tossing small grenades into the fire.  Lisa's mother (J. Smith-Cameron in another strong performance) struggles with a relationship with a French businessman (Jean Reno).  Lisa's flirtation with her math teacher goes much too far.  Lonergan obviously has a lot on his mind and wants to get it all in, but he often loses his way.  The film is not very cohesive and at times frustrating and disorienting.  Still...I have to say, I had a hard time sleeping and continue to think about the film.  As much as I want to categorize it as a near miss, the more I think about it the more I yearn for that 4 hour version.The Blu ray transfer is decent.  Admitedly I watched it on a smaller display than I usually use but I thought the film looked a little dark and soft.  It comes in 1080p with a 1.85:1 aspect ratio.  The audio is just fine with a nice DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track.  The sound is mostly upfront with occasional street sounds from the surrounds.

1464081,A3TO3AY1UFM83U,B005LAIGF0,"not a natural ""Bob Bickel""","[3, 6]","This unduly long film is sufficiently amorphous and thematically uncertain that it lends itself to a variety of interpretations.  I suspect that whoever edited it was as confused as I was as to what was going on and why some of the characters were inserted.  Yes, life is complex and defies easy summary in the form of a convenient narrative, but this movie takes off in too many directions with too little coherence to make it honestly interpretable as a cinematic whole.  Maybe if I had read Gerard Manley Hopkins' poem ""Margaret"" immediately before viewing this DVD by the same name I would have had a ready-made point of departure for making sense of some of it, but that really shouldn't be necessary.  ""Margaret"" the film should speak for itself a lot more clearly than it does.Coming of age is painful, episodic, fraught with fits and starts, nonlinear, and unpredictable.  Sometimes it takes an horrific turn, assuring an unnaturally difficult maturation process, as with Lisa, ""Margaret's"" main character.  It seemed to me, however, that Lisa was never so willfully oblivious and callow that she needed this sort of brutally painful shock to jump-start her movement toward maturity.  She may have been a bit self-absorbed and arrogant, but her biography as we knew it seemed to assure that she had experienced her share of bumps, bruises, indifference, disappointment, and betrayal, and that a more privileged and insulated protagonist would have better filled her role.  Yes, she lived an upper middle class life in an upper middle class world, but whatever smugness she had left could have been remedied with something less destructive than post-traumatic stress disorder.  No, there are no guarantees that we'll get what we need and deserve, or what seems fitting, but scars inflicted on smooth skin seem more telling for the viewer than scars inflicted on scars.  Too much of the latter and we don't come of age, we simply fail to thrive at all.Lisa's mother was portrayed very effectively by J. Cameron Smith, but she seemed as confused and unfinished as her daughter.  Lisa's father was a remote and determinedly ineffectual figure whose blandness made lack of affect seem like a dynamic phenomenon.  Her younger brother appeared on screen occasionally, but his character remained completely undeveloped, making one wonder why he was there.  Jean Reno's Colombian businessman, who courted Lisa's mother throughout most of the movie, seemed as inept and unconcerned as Lisa's father, making one wonder if her mother was somehow drawn to expressionless, self-centered bores.  Matt Damon and Matthew Broderick had thankless roles as more or less adequate teachers, though Broderick's inability to anticipate and handle out-of-the-ordinary student responses would puzzle anyone who has taught for even a few years -- it comes with the territory.  Jeannie Berlin does a great caricature of a middle-aged, single, Manhattan Jew with time on her hands.  New York is impersonal, drab, dirty, glitzy, cultured, cruel, and is given entirely too much cinematic attention.  We get it!  Enough!Lisa is confused, disappointed, frustrated, seductive, guilt-ridden, naive, spoiled, an easy mark, awkward, attractive, obsessive, annoying, angry, troubled, destructive, and, I suppose, working toward adulthood.  Most people are most or all of these things at one time or another over the course of a lifetime.  But all in one film?  Anna Paquin is undeniably talented and does the best she can, but it's an awful lot to ask of one actor in one movie, especially when the script dictates a startlingly ambiguous and lame ending, one that suggests the author finally ran out of steam but made sure to do so in an obscure and pretentious fashion.Life is hard.  It takes an act of bad faith to represent that fact in an histrionic, overwrought, idiosyncratically artsy and artificial way.

Maybe that's the point, to give a panaromic view --- but it's been done much better (namely, Atom Egoyan's icy masterpiece The Sweet Hereafter).

1464085,AJRFZ0VZ0LD26,B005LAIGF0,"Reader ""Eugenia""","[0, 0]","Margaret is a film about  a young woman (Lisa), living in NYC, who attends private high school.  She is child of intellectuals and is at the age when she is aware of her sexual appeal to men.  Her parents are divorced and her father lives on the West Coast.  Her mother is a Broadway actress, which means that Lisa and her younger brother get to spend a lot of time on their own when their mother is rehearsing or performing.Lisa is not a problem kid, she is curious about the adolosence and not quite sure how to deal with it since there is no one (no adult) available to talk to her about it.  One day, Lisa's action of distracting a bus driver ends in tragedy - a woman gets killed crossing pedestrian when driver runs the red light.  Lisa realizes she is a partial reason for what happened but does not acknowledge that right away to herself, her parents and police investigators of the accident.  As expected, our unconscious mind has a way of catching up with us in the most unopportune times.  Suddently, Lisa starts neglecting her schoolwork, she is irritable when dealing with her mother and school friends and she attempts to dull her emotional pain by having sex with her high school mate and later on her geometry teacher.  Needless to say, such escape(s) bring Lisa no relief - as a matter of fact, it only brings her additional problems.Perhaps Lisa is spoilt, perhaps her view of right and wrong is a little confusing to her (do not forget that she is only a teenager and she is quite impulsive), but eventually her grief over what happened during the bus accident catches up with her.  Lisa's life is changed forever and she ultimately grows up overnight.This is a complex movie, perhaps more suited for stage than film.  However, it kept my attention from start to finish.  I particularly liked the film ending.  It is unexpected, but it does bring relief and at least some sense of closure with hope for Lisa's future and her understanding of other people's needs, motives, loss and love.

Torn apart by guilt and frustration that justice is an increasingly distant option, she punishes herself with self-loathing and hurts those around her as she realizes the real world of adults is a nebulous place where doing what's right is a foggy ideal seldom clearly defined.Margaret is not a character in the movie but rather a reference in Gerard Manley Hopkins 1888 poem ""Spring and Fall."" Hopkins asks: ""Margaret, are you grieving, Over Goldengrove unleaving?"" and then answers at poem's end ""...It is the blight man was born for, It is Margaret you mourn for.""The theatrical release has a running time of 150 minutes and it's the Blu-ray disc on the combo pack.

1464089,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B005LAIGF0,Roland E. Zwick,"[3, 4]","Kenneth Lonergan`s ""Margaret"" is a movie completely devoid of conventional thinking and cliches.  In fact, at any given moment, its characters are likely to do or say something that seems wholly out-of-character, counterintuitive and unexpected.  That may be off-putting to some who prefer a bit more predictability in their narratives, but it becomes a highly rewarding experience for those who don`t.And no one is more inscrutable than Lisa, the movie's protagonist (the title, ""Margaret,"" comes from a character referred to in a poem). Trying to probe Lisa's motives for why she does what she does can be frustrating at times for the viewer (and that`s putting it mildly).  As played by ""True Blood's"" Anna Paquin, Lisa is a moody Manhattan teen who becomes even moodier after she inadvertently causes a fatal accident while flirting with a bus driver (Mark Ruffalo, in a truly compelling performance).  Trying to find a way to process her guilt, Lisa turns to various people in her life, including her harassed and harried actress mother (J. Smith-Cameron), her physically and emotionally distant father, an eccentric friend of the woman whose death she caused, the bus driver himself, a teacher she has a crush on (Matt Damon), a random sex partner, the police, and various lawyers who become involved in the legal proceedings surrounding the accident.  But every action she takes seems to make matters only more confused and complicated, till finally she seems to be lashing out at people with no real rhyme or reason for why she`s doing so.  But the strange sense of imbalance this causes is what gives the movie its verisimilitude, for we sense that this is indeed what life would be like for people caught up in a tragedy of this magnitude - a sort of random but cruel cosmic joke that no one could ever be expected to process in a neat and orderly fashion (as most movies on such subjects might be tempted to do).  Life and relationships are messy things, the filmmakers seem to be saying, and ""Margaret"" captures that truth with unerring precision.Nothing in ""Margaret"" ever seems stage or planned, not the plot twists and certainly not the interactions among the characters.  The relationship between Lisa - a fairly typical teen who thinks she knows it all and looks with scoffing disdain on the adults who are all obviously too foolish to really know what's what - and her mother, who doesn't understand why she and her daughter have begun suddenly drifting apart, has the definite ring of truth about it. That goes for all the other relationships in the movie as well.  And, true to the code, the ending does not come in a box all neatly wrapped with a fancy bow on the top for the audience to take out of the theater with them. It's just a single moment caught in time, no more or no less definitive than any other moment in life.Along with the fine writing and direction, excellent supporting performances by Kieran Culkin, Olivia Thirlby, Alison Janney and Jean Reno enhance and enrich the experience.",4,Avoids cliches like the plague (itself a cliche),1350086400,"10 13, 2012",2012,3019,"['Kenneth', 'Lonergan', 's', 'Margaret', 'movie', 'completely', 'devoid', 'conventional', 'thinking', 'cliches', 'fact', 'given', 'moment', 'characters', 'are', 'likely', 'do', 'say', 'something', 'wholly', 'out-of-character', 'counterintuitive', 'unexpected', 'may', 'be', 'off-putting', 'who', 'prefer', 'bit', 'more', 'predictability', 'narratives', 'highly', 'rewarding', 'experience', 'who', 'don', 't.And', 'one', 'more', 'inscrutable', 'Lisa', 'movie', 'protagonist', 'title', 'Margaret', 'character', 'referred', 'poem', 'Trying', 'probe', 'Lisa', 'motives', 'why', 'what', 'can', 'be', 'frustrating', 'times', 'viewer', 's', 'putting', 'mildly', 'played', 'True', 'Blood', 'Anna', 'Paquin', 'Lisa', 'moody', 'Manhattan', 'teen', 'who', 'even', 'moodier', 'inadvertently', 'fatal', 'accident', 'flirting', 'bus', 'driver', 'Mark', 'Ruffalo', 'truly', 'compelling', 'performance', 'Trying', 'find', 'way', 'process', 'guilt', 'Lisa', 'various', 'people', 'life', 'including', 'harassed', 'harried', 'actress', 'mother', 'J.', 'Smith-Cameron', 'physically', 'emotionally', 'distant', 'father', 'eccentric', 'friend', 'woman', 'death', 'caused', 'bus', 'driver', 'teacher', 'crush', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'random', 'sex', 'partner', 'police', 'various', 'lawyers', 'who', 'become', 'involved', 'legal', 'proceedings', 'surrounding', 'accident', 'action', 'make', 'matters', 'only', 'more', 'confused', 'complicated', 'till', 'finally', 'be', 'lashing', 'out', 'people', 'real', 'rhyme', 'reason', 'why', 's', 'doing', 'so', 'strange', 'sense', 'imbalance', 'what', 'movie', 'verisimilitude', 'sense', 'indeed', 'what', 'life', 'would', 'be', 'people', 'caught', 'up', 'tragedy', 'magnitude', 'sort', 'random', 'cruel', 'cosmic', 'joke', 'one', 'could', 'ever', 'be', 'expected', 'process', 'neat', 'orderly', 'fashion', 'most', 'movies', 'such', 'subjects', 'might', 'be', 'tempted', 'do', 'Life', 'relationships', 'are', 'messy', 'things', 'filmmakers', 'seem', 'be', 'saying', 'Margaret', 'truth', 'unerring', 'precision.Nothing', 'Margaret', 'ever', 'stage', 'planned', 'not', 'plot', 'twists', 'certainly', 'not', 'interactions', 'characters', 'relationship', 'Lisa', 'fairly', 'typical', 'teen', 'who', 'scoffing', 'disdain', 'adults', 'who', 'are', 'obviously', 'too', 'foolish', 'really', 'know', 'what', 'what', 'mother', 'who', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'daughter', 'have', 'begun', 'suddenly', 'drifting', 'apart', 'definite', 'ring', 'truth', 'other', 'relationships', 'movie', 'as', 'well', 'true', 'code', 'ending', 'not', 'come', 'box', 'neatly', 'wrapped', 'fancy', 'bow', 'top', 'audience', 'take', 'theater', 'just', 'single', 'moment', 'caught', 'time', 'more', 'less', 'definitive', 'other', 'moment', 'life.Along', 'fine', 'writing', 'direction', 'excellent', 'supporting', 'performances', 'Kieran', 'Culkin', 'Olivia', 'Thirlby', 'Alison', 'Janney', 'Jean', 'Reno', 'enhance', 'enrich', 'experience']",Margaret

1464092,AWUUMER0F3WF4,B005LAIGF0,Sheryl Fechter,"[5, 7]","This movie, set in New York City, presents us with the seventeen year old Lisa (portrayed convincingly by the wonderful Anna Paquin).  Kenneth Lonergan directs her and a broad, talented cast in a mind-blowing film concerning the results due to a tragedy: Life shattering results.The insightful J. Smith-Cameron portrays Joan, who does a mind galvanizing job as Lisa's mother; bewildered and patient. Taking hit after hit from the daughter she no longer knows nor understands, this begins quickly and without warning.There isn't character building for an audience to view before a horrific accident happens right in the very street in front of a young Lisa.  This is no ordinary occurrence, as it is so painfully and shockingly real that I had to stop the film directly afterwards to shakily catch my breath.  I was literally in tears for awhile. That was how awestruck I was from this, as it is so meticulously done along with actress Allison Janney.This immediately sets into motion the above written series of conditions in the title of the review. A chain reaction, if you will. It's that sudden, that mercurial also. If this were a true story, Lisa would never have a hope of being the same person that she was again. This would change her life, her perspective and the way she reacts from this point on.It is usual that behavior becomes problematic after a traumatic incident, as each one is subjective to the person experiencing it. This occasion is to the extreme for Lisa: actually for anyone who would be forced to witness this. Trauma is a dance in hell.  The memory of it is written in indelible ink on one's psyche.The perfection in the facial expressions with the photography (Ryszard Lenczewski) and several director's still shots, express so much of the oncoming symptoms that Lisa will begin projecting straight away. These are all branded during the lurid tragedy scene in the street; graphically filmed and superbly acted.Lisa becomes quite extroverted with her inflammatory statements and angry outbursts directed towards everyone, especially attacking and alienating her mother. She is self-medicating with certain drugs, rebellious and altogether confrontational. Lisa says of herself, ""I'm this mass of conflicting impulses"".  With this statement, Lisa is very self-aware.She also begins doing poorly in school while beforehand she was working towards a scholarship.  Along with getting into wrongful behaviors with certain teachers, especially Matt Damon, she is also with other boys.  It really does not matter to Lisa who the person may be, as she is becoming hyper-sexual.Lisa rapidly is painting a portrait of inappropriateness and she does not care one little bit about anything, with one exception. This being her initial statement given to the police at the time of the traumatic incident, as she obsessively starts seeking an end result to this issue.These stressful situations elevate to a fever pitch before the movie can conclude. Ending in a single, and very subtle, outpouring of emotion.  Hopefully Lisa can finally feel warmth along with the mother she kept forcing out since she was traumatized.  Lisa begins to appear she is on her way home again.",5,Traumatized = In Shock = Erratic Behavior = Lisa,1342483200,"07 17, 2012",2012,3187,"['movie', 'set', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'seventeen', 'year', 'old', 'Lisa', 'portrayed', 'convincingly', 'wonderful', 'Anna', 'Paquin', 'Kenneth', 'Lonergan', 'broad', 'talented', 'cast', 'mind-blowing', 'film', 'concerning', 'results', 'due', 'tragedy', 'Life', 'shattering', 'results.The', 'insightful', 'J.', 'Smith-Cameron', 'Joan', 'who', 'mind', 'galvanizing', 'job', 'Lisa', 'mother', 'bewildered', 'patient', 'Taking', 'hit', 'hit', 'daughter', 'no', 'longer', 'understands', 'quickly', 'warning.There', ""n't"", 'character', 'building', 'audience', 'view', 'horrific', 'accident', 'happens', 'right', 'very', 'street', 'front', 'young', 'Lisa', 'ordinary', 'occurrence', 'so', 'painfully', 'shockingly', 'real', 'had', 'stop', 'film', 'directly', 'afterwards', 'shakily', 'catch', 'breath', 'was', 'literally', 'tears', 'awhile', 'was', 'how', 'awestruck', 'was', 'so', 'meticulously', 'done', 'actress', 'Allison', 'Janney.This', 'immediately', 'motion', 'above', 'written', 'series', 'conditions', 'title', 'review', 'chain', 'reaction', 'will', 'sudden', 'mercurial', 'also', 'were', 'true', 'story', 'Lisa', 'would', 'never', 'have', 'hope', 'being', 'same', 'person', 'was', 'again', 'would', 'change', 'life', 'perspective', 'way', 'point', 'on.It', 'usual', 'behavior', 'becomes', 'problematic', 'traumatic', 'incident', 'one', 'subjective', 'person', 'experiencing', 'occasion', 'extreme', 'Lisa', 'actually', 'anyone', 'who', 'would', 'be', 'forced', 'witness', 'Trauma', 'dance', 'hell', 'memory', 'written', 'indelible', 'ink', 'one', 'psyche.The', 'perfection', 'facial', 'expressions', 'photography', 'Ryszard', 'Lenczewski', 'several', 'director', 'still', 'shots', 'express', 'so', 'much', 'oncoming', 'symptoms', 'Lisa', 'will', 'begin', 'projecting', 'straight', 'away', 'are', 'branded', 'lurid', 'tragedy', 'scene', 'street', 'graphically', 'filmed', 'superbly', 'acted.Lisa', 'becomes', 'quite', 'extroverted', 'inflammatory', 'statements', 'angry', 'outbursts', 'directed', 'everyone', 'especially', 'attacking', 'alienating', 'mother', 'self-medicating', 'certain', 'drugs', 'rebellious', 'altogether', 'confrontational', 'Lisa', 'herself', ""'m"", 'mass', 'conflicting', 'impulses', 'statement', 'Lisa', 'very', 'self-aware.She', 'also', 'doing', 'poorly', 'school', 'beforehand', 'was', 'working', 'scholarship', 'getting', 'wrongful', 'behaviors', 'certain', 'teachers', 'especially', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'also', 'other', 'boys', 'really', 'not', 'matter', 'Lisa', 'who', 'person', 'may', 'be', 'becoming', 'hyper-sexual.Lisa', 'rapidly', 'painting', 'portrait', 'inappropriateness', 'not', 'care', 'one', 'little', 'bit', 'anything', 'one', 'exception', 'being', 'initial', 'statement', 'given', 'police', 'time', 'traumatic', 'incident', 'obsessively', 'seeking', 'end', 'result', 'issue.These', 'stressful', 'situations', 'elevate', 'fever', 'pitch', 'movie', 'can', 'conclude', 'Ending', 'single', 'very', 'subtle', 'outpouring', 'emotion', 'Hopefully', 'Lisa', 'can', 'finally', 'feel', 'warmth', 'mother', 'kept', 'forcing', 'out', 'was', 'traumatized', 'Lisa', 'appear', 'way', 'home', 'again']",Margaret

Lisa is witness to a bus accident which knocks down and kills a woman when the lights were red.Only Lisa feels guilty,troubled after her 1st hysterical witness statement at the scene, holding the dying woman's hand,feeling the woman's confusion telling her to phone her daughter(also called Lisa) but screaming at her not to leave as if she was her daughter.Lisa believes the lights she said were green were really red.She helped cause the accident because she herself waved to the driver(Ruffalo) as he was driving(he was wearing a cowboy hat which she wanted to know where he got ),she distracted him,thus taking his eye off the road,pulling up the breaks later than he would have.He went through the lights as the woman was about to cross the road.She attempts to interview the driver herself,explosively.Now Lisa argues with her mother,a stage actress who cares more for how her latest stage performance is doing than Lisa's needs.Lisa argues constantly in her classes at school on Shakespeare or 9/11,feeling wound up easily,trying to make points,throwing out more heat than light.She has a platonic boyfriend,who she treats badly when he wants a date or phones her.She loses her virginity by phoning the coolest male in the school and asks him to help her lose it while her family are out.She also has an affair with her geometry teacher(Matt Damon),and lets him know that he is the only person who understands her.Lisa keeps in touch with her businessman father by phoning him on the west coast. Hoping to go and visit him and stay for a year.Lisa legally pursues the accident case through the deceased woman's friend,Emily.However,Lisa is her own worst enemy and even argues with her.Paquin's performance of an at times unlikeable character is superb.She also has an abortion.She is overblown and operatic and is reconciled with her motherat a performance of The Tales of Hoffman.This is half hour longer than the theatrical release.The most remarkable thing is the Drieser-like sweep of the camera,the constant awareness of NYC life bustling around,the beautifully crafted cuts and fades,the panning of the camera over streets,up buildings,across the horizon,but the central character's intense emotional solipsism is remarkably framed by brilliant cameos from Damon, Ruffalo, Broderick and the director's wife,J.Smith-Cameron.Get it while you can.",5,Unexpressed sorrow's springs,1342569600,"07 18, 2012",2012,2897,"['momentous', 'DVD', 'running', '3', 'hours', 'Margaret', 'Hopkins', 'poem', 'having', 'gone', 'legal', 'battles', 'getting', 'screen', 'having', 'different', 'versions', 'lawsuit', 'director/writer', 'Lonergan', 'breach', 'contract', 'trial', 'year.The', 'film', 'based', 'phenomenon', 'caring', 'too', 'much', 'teenage', 'Lisa', 'Paquin', 'self-dramatising', 'everything', 'raging', 'sea', 'hormones', 'emotions.Her', 'mother', 'father', 'are', 'divorced', 'mother', 'small', 'brother', 'who', 'piano', 'avoid', 'heat', 'Lisa', 'witness', 'bus', 'accident', 'down', 'kills', 'woman', 'when', 'lights', 'were', 'red.Only', 'Lisa', 'feels', 'guilty', 'troubled', '1st', 'hysterical', 'witness', 'statement', 'scene', 'holding', 'dying', 'woman', 'hand', 'feeling', 'woman', 'confusion', 'telling', 'phone', 'daughter', 'also', 'called', 'Lisa', 'screaming', 'not', 'leave', 'was', 'daughter.Lisa', 'lights', 'said', 'were', 'green', 'were', 'really', 'red.She', 'helped', 'cause', 'accident', 'waved', 'driver', 'Ruffalo', 'was', 'driving', 'was', 'wearing', 'cowboy', 'hat', 'wanted', 'know', 'where', 'got', 'distracted', 'thus', 'taking', 'eye', 'road', 'pulling', 'up', 'breaks', 'later', 'would', 'have.He', 'went', 'lights', 'woman', 'was', 'cross', 'road.She', 'interview', 'driver', 'Lisa', 'mother', 'stage', 'actress', 'who', 'more', 'how', 'latest', 'stage', 'performance', 'doing', 'Lisa', 'needs.Lisa', 'argues', 'constantly', 'classes', 'school', 'Shakespeare', '9/11', 'feeling', 'wound', 'up', 'easily', 'trying', 'make', 'points', 'throwing', 'out', 'more', 'heat', 'light.She', 'platonic', 'boyfriend', 'who', 'badly', 'when', 'date', 'phones', 'her.She', 'virginity', 'phoning', 'coolest', 'male', 'school', 'help', 'lose', 'family', 'are', 'out.She', 'also', 'affair', 'geometry', 'teacher', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'know', 'only', 'person', 'who', 'her.Lisa', 'keeps', 'touch', 'businessman', 'father', 'phoning', 'west', 'coast', 'Hoping', 'go', 'visit', 'stay', 'year.Lisa', 'legally', 'accident', 'case', 'deceased', 'woman', 'friend', 'Emily.However', 'Lisa', 'own', 'worst', 'enemy', 'even', 'argues', 'her.Paquin', 'performance', 'times', 'unlikeable', 'character', 'superb.She', 'also', 'abortion.She', 'overblown', 'operatic', 'reconciled', 'motherat', 'performance', 'Tales', 'Hoffman.This', 'half', 'hour', 'longer', 'theatrical', 'release.The', 'most', 'remarkable', 'thing', 'Drieser-like', 'sweep', 'camera', 'constant', 'awareness', 'NYC', 'life', 'bustling', 'around', 'beautifully', 'crafted', 'cuts', 'fades', 'panning', 'camera', 'streets', 'up', 'buildings', 'horizon', 'central', 'character', 'intense', 'emotional', 'solipsism', 'remarkably', 'framed', 'brilliant', 'cameos', 'Damon', 'Ruffalo', 'Broderick', 'director', 'wife', 'J.Smith-Cameron.Get', 'can']",Margaret

But that's okay I grew up watching Captain Kangaroo who is nether a captain nor a kangaroo. In fact there may have been a lot of stuff I didn't grasp in this film, but here goes.The film opens in slow motion to illustrate how life moves slowly along until one moment suddenly changes and defines it. Lisa (Anna Paquin) distracts a bus driver who runs a red light and kills a women. She wants to do the right thing, but what is it? The grief and moral dilemma disrupts her life and her relationships.The film is well made. The acting was excellent as was the writing...I think. I just didn't enjoy the film, but I didn't dislike it either. The main problem I have with the overall theme is that Lisa wants justice for the dead woman. She has grief which we see, but we don't see her confess her role in the death except to the bus driver she distracted. She doesn't seem to have any guilt...or perhaps that is the point of the film is that we quickly forgive our own guilt...except we don't. I kept waiting for Lisa to take blame for what had happened and Emily (Jeannie Berlin) punch her in the mouth.This is a film about grief, but it is not really sad. Matt Damon plays a geometry teacher who is a love interest of Lisa. Matthew Broderick plays a literature teacher whose classes provide the film with multiple confusing deeper themes for you to pick from in case you don't like the aspect of simply dealing with grief.

Lisa Cohen (Paquin) is a typical New York teenager. Doin OK in school and has a testy relationship with her mother. One day she goes out looking for a cowboy hat and after a few stores she is disappointed when she can't find one. By chance she notices that a bus driver (Ruffalo) is wearing one and she runs along side of the bus trying to get his attention. He smiles and waves at her, taking his eyes off the road and ends up running down and killing a woman. Trying to protect herself and the driver Lisa doesn't tell the truth in the report. That lie begins to consume her life and she is now bent on revealing the truth, but that sounds easier then it is. I have thought for awhile that when a movie starts to creep up on the 2 1/2 hour mark it better be worth it and interesting. I also think that some directors take the stance that the longer the movie the better the movie. This is not always the case. I open with that for a reason. This is actually a pretty good movie that deals with an interesting issue about a teenager dealing with a traumatic experience in her day to day life. The main problem with this is that it tried so hard to show how she was dealing with it that they couldn't decide what to cut out. So they showed just about everything. Unnecessary scenes of her at school and a whole sub-plot about her mother's stage play and boyfriend really took the focus off of the main reason for the movie. I'm not saying this is a bad movie because it is worth watching, but it could have taken a lot out to give it the emotion that it should have. Overall, a decent movie but because of too much going on it was hard to stay focused and emotionally involved. Watch it and you will see what I mean. I give it a B-.",3,An OK movie that tried to put too much in & because of that it didn't have any emotional impact. Worth watching though.

1464101,AB1CKA6B849SP,B005LAIGF0,zeus,"[3, 6]","Really don't understand how in the world Anna Paquin was not one of the Oscars contenders for this movie.This movie should be cut in half. It's over 2h 30 minutes and there is no reason for this. The long shots over New York sometimes taking over 30 seconds are boring. The DVD has the extended version (...over 3 hr). I haven't seen it yet but I wonder how much longer the shots of New York could be.Anna Paquin is outstanding. Her acting in this movie is something I have only seen from Meryl Streep. She has a great future in the acting business. Again, I really don't understand why she was not nominated for an Oscar (...maybe because she is not part of the establishment and the Hollywood in-crowd).Now to the movie. A bus driver is distracted by a totally irresponsible adolescent and kills a woman who was waiting at a pedestrian cross over. This is a tragic accident very well portrayed in the movie (...blood all over the place with amputation). It is quite obvious that she (Anna Paquin) feels guilty because SHE is responsible for the accident. She never tells anybody the real story about the stupid hat that resulted in someones tragic death. She then takes it on the driver and soon she makes herself believe that it was the driver's fault.Very well done movie and the subplot with her divorced parents it is very credible and very interesting. In most recent movies we are getting the message that most modern couples are irresponsible. They get together, have kids and then everybody wants to live like they were single again. In the mean time the daughter is looking for attention to boys in school who are on drugs and selfish. We don't know much about her little brother, but we can guess that he is going to grow up to become another dysfunctional member of our society BECAUSE of his parents.Her mom wants to be a mom but still works 18 hours a day, and her dad wants to be around but he moved across the country and now has an hysterical selfish girlfriend (...oh wait he is on the west coast, that's normal). When you have kids you have to give up things. You have to compromise for the good of the kids. Most adults are now the product of divorced parents, are screwed up, are making the psychiatrists rich and think that is normal. No it is not! There are normal kids out there with a mom and a dad at home!Four stars only because it is unnecessary long. Otherwise I would have given five stars.Great movie!
