I would have bought nearly all of their releases if they at least had only english subtitles. Don't they think of their profit, because just this kind of moviesis highly interesting for older people who very often need subtitles because they are hard of hearing. Besides all that older people may have a little pleasure don't you think Olive? I think younger people are not very interested in buying this kind of movies. Same goes for a.o.

40315,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,0782006795,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 2]","A few years ago I happened to stumble upon &#8216;The Awful Truth&#8217;, a 1937 screwball comedy starring Irene Dunne and Cary Grant that chronicled the end of their marriage, pending divorce and eventual reconciliation.  It was a very important film for me at the time, for I saw it during a brief separation from my wife and looking at the same situation I was facing in a humorous (and hopeful) light was just what I needed to &#8216;face the day&#8217; so-to-speak.  Thankfully, as I mentioned, that separation was brief.  My wife and I did reconcile and things between us are better than they have ever been.  Since then, that movie has had a special place in my heart.  It also marked the first time that screen legends Grant and Dunne worked with one another.  They would work together twice more, and &#8216;Penny Serenade&#8217; was their third and final film together.Reading the synopsis for this particular film, I couldn&#8217;t help but feel like this was &#8216;The Awful Truth&#8217; just with a gimmick.  Yes, there are stark differences, but the general gist is the same.  A couple, at the end of their marriage, face impending divorce and work to reconcile.  The fact that it also starred Dunne and Grant felt like too much of the same, and yet I was intrigued because of the similarities as well.And then the film started.One thing that I didn&#8217;t expect from &#8216;Penny Serenade&#8217; was how dramatic this was going to be.  Considering my previous experience with this pair and this subject, I expected another screwball comedy.  Yes, there are funny elements to this film, but overall there is a very dramatic tone.Melodramatic, but we&#8217;ll get to that in a minute.&#8216;Penny Serenade&#8217; tells the story of Julie Gardiner and Roger Adams.  They meet, they fall in love, they get married, they struggle, they suffer tragedy (miscarriage) and then they struggle to adopt and move on.  Told in vignettes inspired by records kept by Julie to memorialize their &#8216;happy marriage&#8217;, the film is broken up in segments that tell of specific times.  Their meeting (at a record store, how appropriate), their dating, engagement, business struggles, baby issues, adoption, fight for baby, life as parents, life AFTER parenthood; all of these aspects given ample room to breathe, but maybe too much air.I&#8217;ll start by saying that I like this movie.  I know that it is largely considered a classic, and you just don&#8217;t talk bad about classics (which I&#8217;ve done many times and will consider to do), but I do take issue with many aspects of this film that I just don&#8217;t think worked very well.First, the gimmick.While I actually find the idea of composing sequences of events shaped by the music found in Julie&#8217;s book to be inspired and ripe with potential, those scenes didn&#8217;t feel swift enough to flow and eventually the film become bogged down by scenes that didn&#8217;t fit well together or wound up overstaying their welcome.  For example, the baby bath/diaper change scene was just tiring to watch.  One long shot that became burdensome to the viewer.  I could charge George Stevens with this, since he could have played with a few angles in order to make the scene less uninteresting, but really it just should have been edited down.  I also found that the gimmick itself wasn&#8217;t worked into each scene (or group of scenes) well enough to validate the gimmick itself.  I expected it to be cleverer in that regard.  The first scene (their meeting) was so rich and so beautiful and so clever that it set the bar so high it was hard for the film to reach those heights again.I also take serious note with the melodramatic nature of the film.  It is so incredibly obvious with all the sappy sentiment that it loses some of the clever touches to an overabundance of pandering to the audience.  It wants to tell us everything and beat everyone over the head with their point (look a baby, another baby, a picture of a baby).  The entire second half (with regards to anything baby related) almost feels like an entirely different film altogether, losing all lightness and becoming this overly saturated depiction of familial tensions.It tries way too hard.I also really disliked the conclusion, and I&#8217;ll elaborate on that a little here (so, I guess I&#8217;ll yell SPOILERS for anyone unfamiliar with the film itself).  When &#8216;Penny Serenade&#8217; concludes, Julie and Roger are in the throes of divorce (or impending).  They have lost their daughter in a swift and unexpected death that has rattled them.  They cannot communicate with one another.  They are punishing themselves (mostly Roger) and in the same breath punishing one another and when all the dust has settled Roger is convinced that he just cannot be around Julie or his home or anything and anyone that reminds him of what he has lost.  In her desperation, Julie has written to the same adoption agency where they had received their beautiful Trina, and into the hands of Miss Oliver (the woman who made their adoption possible) lands a letter that touches her so much, she suddenly finds them another child to adopt.  This obviously fixes everything and &#8216;Penny Serenade&#8217; ends on an upbeat and joyful, hope filled ending despite only three minutes earlier looking about as gloomy as an Ingmar Bergman film.This just doesn&#8217;t work for me.  This feels so lazy and like such an easy way to cop out of really telling us the whole story.  The fragmented way the story is told also suffers most in the finale, because we have so much build up to then have so little real explanation of anything and it feels so rushed, like they knew the film was running long but couldn&#8217;t be pressed with actually editing what they had already shot.  The &#8216;a baby fixes everything&#8217; mentality is also a wash when you consider that this wasn&#8217;t about a baby anymore but was about the LOSS of a child, and making the &#8216;quick fix&#8217; all about replacing one child with another seemed rather heartless and inaccurate.  The fact that the facts surrounding the new adoption (It&#8217;s a boy!  He has dimples!  He&#8217;s two years old!) makes this all feel very much like a &#8220;don&#8217;t worry, you&#8217;re finally getting what you always wanted&#8221; is all the more disconcerting.It was borderline offensive, to tell you the truth.I do understand that a certain amount of suspension of disbelief is needed with some of these older films, and a lot of issues were sugarcoated for the censors sake (aren&#8217;t we glad we don&#8217;t have to deal with that anymore) but sometimes it just rings false, and I take issue with that here.Despite all of these quibbles, the film does benefit from two very strong anchors carrying the film from start to finish.  Cary Grant received his first of two Oscar nominations for this performance (most likely for his teary eyed monologue with the judge regarding Trina) and it was deserved.  Even when the film sails into nonsensical territory, he sells it.  Even more impressive though, is Irene Dunne.  She is just magnificent here.  She has a less showy role, but she says so much with her eyes, and since she has those few scenes in-between segments that help tie them all together (she&#8217;s the one that switches out the records), you get this sense that she is filling every aspect of this movie with her presence and her character.  The supporting cast is less consistent.  Edger Buchanan is softhearted and moving, but Beulah Bondi is so stiff lifeless (despite trying to convey the thoughtful angel) and her character is so ridiculous that I found her off-putting.I know that this sounds like a lot of griping, but I really didn&#8217;t hate this.  I guess I just really expected so much more.",3,A penny for my thoughts?,1391731200,"02 7, 2014",2014,7819,"['few', 'years', 'ago', 'happened', 'stumble', '8216', 'Awful', 'Truth', '8217', '1937',

40316,A2I17T9XB6LSGW,0782006795,Andrew McCaffrey,"[3, 7]","(Please note that the DVD edition I am reviewing is the Laserlight release that features introductory remarks by Tony Curtis.)The biggest problem that I had with PENNY SERENADE was the pacing, or lack thereof.  The first half crawls by at a tortoise pace, with the main characters taking forever to get from point A to point B.  By contrast, the second part flies by far too quickly, with huge jumps that skip us past large sections of the characters' emotional lives.  It seems to end with a shockingly depressing twist that comes completely out of nowhere, but in literally the last minute events change, robbing us of any emotional investment that we may have made in the process.I hate to be so negative of this film, especially given how uniformly excellent the cast is.  With the lone exception of a single child actor (who isn't nearly as bad as some other children would have been in the role), the acting is believable and superb.  Even during some of the more comedic sections, Cary Grant has toned down his more over-the-top excesses, creating a character that is realistic, but also amusing.  Irene Dunn is similarly excellent, and allows her character to seem swept along by events, but not letting herself be carried away in the melodrama.  The two leads gave balanced and thoughtful performances that were a joy to watch.The beginning and middle sections of the film really drag in places.  I don't mind slow-paced movies, but in PENNY SERENADE there seemed to be long stretches that were neither interesting nor plot advancing.  For example, there's a ten to fifteen minute section that takes place in Japan, apparently for no reason other than for the main characters to be caught in an earthquake.  There are scenes that take forever to build up, and result in little pay-off.  It's very frustrating to sit through all of this, especially when one considers how rushed the final part of the film is.The last part of the movie ends up feeling much choppier and more hurried than the previous sections did.  We jump from scene to scene without fully seeing the motivations and reasons behind the action.  Several major events take place off screen and are only referred to.  I wouldn't have minded if it was just one or two moments, but it seemed to me that every important event was missed which severely reduced the emotional impact.  The ending to the film itself feels like a complete cheat.  I hate to see films that resort to cheap tricks to provoke a reaction from the audience, but that's exactly what happened here.  And worse, the contrivance isn't even played up to its full potential.  The emotions that we're supposed to experience are totally undercut in literally the final seconds of the film by another illogical plot twist that comes out of nowhere.  I suspect (but do not know) that the studio requesting this in order to create a false happy ending, but whatever the reasons, it ruins any emotional substance in what was already a fairly dubious conclusion.The incoherence of the ending isn't helped by the fact that virtually the whole film is told in a series of flashbacks.  These flashbacks consist entirely of Dunn's character sitting in a chair, listening to old records, and thinking about the events that led her to the present.  Now, I don't mind flashbacks in movies at all.  I think that, handled correctly, they can add a great sense of discontinuity and mystery.  It can be quite intriguing to figure out how the flashbacks will eventually lead to the present.  The problem with the way they are handled in PENNY SERENADE is that very little has been set up beforehand.  The flashbacks serve no purpose other than to simply be there as a gimmick.  The structure doesn't add anything to the film and serves only as an annoying distraction.The DVD's introductory remarks by Tony Curtis may come as a surprise to viewers familiar with his comments that have accompanied other Laserlight releases.  Often his introductions are unintentionally hilarious, with Mr. Curtis bouncing between incoherence and almost gleeful hamminess.  But in his preamble to the feature movie here, he comes across as someone who is genuinely a fan of Cary Grant and of his impressive body of work.All in all, I was disappointed by this movie.  There are some very good and very sweet moments (especially those that seem designed to get past the very strict censors of the day), but overall the film feels disjointed.  The acting from the main performers is excellent, with additional credit going to many of the well-acted secondary characters.  But the acting alone couldn't save this film.  The story is too padded in the beginning and too shallow at the end.  The directing doesn't save the film from its own flaws.  There a several good individual portions, but taken as a whole it just doesn't work.",2,"The beginning is too slow, the ending is too fast",1014336000,"02 22, 2002",2002,4828,"['Please', 'note',

The screenplay of Morrie Ryskind based on a story by Martha Cheavens is sentimental and heartwrenching. Cary Grant and Irene Dunne make it all seem real and director Stevens gives the film a romantic glow which makes this one of the most fondly remembered films of the 1940's.The story opens as Julie (Dunne) is getting ready to leave Roger (Grant) because of the pain caused by a tragedy in their lives he can not talk about so that they can begin to heal. She laments that they simply don't need each other anymore. When she finds an old stack of records she begins to trace the various stages of their love through the memories recalled by each song.Roger sees Julie through the window of the record store where she works, and though he doesn't have a phonograph player, he ends up buying a big package of songs just so he can spend time with her. He pretends he is going her way after work and it isn't long before she becomes ""his funny little redhead."" There are some wonderful scenes like Julie and Roger sitting in a cabana by the beach reading fortune cookies which gives the story a very romantic atmosphere.When Roger, who is a reporter, has a chance to go to Tokyo for a few years, the two get married and have a truncated honeymoon on a train which results in them becoming prospective parents. But an earthquake takes their happiness away and prevents them from having another child. Only when Roger gets an inheritance do they move back to the states and consider adoption while he starts the small town paper he has always dreamed of. What follows is warm, sweet and heartbreaking, and will result in Julie standing at the phonograph as she recalls their lives together before leaving.Whether their love and marriage can be saved is only resolved in the last few moments of this beautiful film. Edgar Buchanan as Apple Jack is absolutely wonderful as he lends both support and humor to this true screen classic. Beulah Bondi is also memorable as the kind Miss Oliver, going out of her way to create a family for two people who love each other.

40328,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,0782006795,Ed Uyeshima,"[2, 3]","The assured hand of master filmmaker George Stevens makes the third and final pairing of Cary Grant and Irene Dunne more than an emotionally satisfying experience. Unlike the first two films - Leo McCarey'sThe Awful Truth(1937) and Garson Kanin'sMy Favorite Wife(1940) - this wholly sentimental 1941 tearjerker is not remotely a screwball comedy. That's not to say Grant and Dunne do not exude their customary charm and grace in their roles. They do in spades and continue to show the easy rapport that made them so compatible in all their films together. The film is also an early, uncommonly mature look at the challenges that arise with marriage and adoption, a precursor to later accomplished films like 1967'sTwo for the Road.Written by Morrie Ryskind (who wrote the classics,My Man GodfreyandStage Door), the time-spanning story of Julie and Roger Adams is told in flashbacks as Julie plays her collection of 78's on an old Victrola. Just as she is about to leave Roger, the songs spark memories of defining episodes from their courtship and marriage. The early part of their relationship is played out fully with the stars' wit and charm as Roger attempts to pick up Julie by buying a pile of records at the store in which she works (even though he doesn't have a record player). They marry, and when he gets a career break as a reporter in Japan, she joins him and announces her pregnancy. This brief interlude is most amusing in hindsight as it shows a very stereotypical view of pre-WWII Japan right out ofMadame Butterfly(the film was released a mere eight months before Pearl Harbor). In an intriguing display of early special effects, the 1923 Tokyo earthquake destroys their home, and she loses her baby and any chance of future conception.This intractable loss becomes the impetus for the rest of the story, as they come back to California and attempt to adopt while running a local newspaper. They eventually adopt and raise a daughter from infancy, Trina, but further tragedy ensues to a palpable breaking point. As the classic film stars that they truly were, Grant and Dunne show how skillfully they can balance drama and comedy with a heavy emphasis on the humanism of the characters. Grant, in particular, has a heartbreaking scene where Roger begs a judge to allow Julie and him to keep their baby daughter despite their dwindling economic circumstances. Edgar Buchanan (long before his lazy Uncle Joe on TV'sPetticoat Junction) and Beulah Bondi provide able support as their devoted friend Applejack and Miss Oliver, the compassionate adoption agency worker, respectively.

40335,ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV,0782006795,"Gary F. Taylor ""GFT""","[93, 97]","Directed by George Stevens and starring Cary Grant and Irene Dunne, PENNY SERENADE was among the most admired films of 1941.  But it seems the film has now drifted into public domain, and the result is incredibly dire: a very muddy soundtrack coupled to a picture that shudders and shakes so that you can barely stand to look at it.This a great pity, for PENNY SERENADE is a fine film that deserves much better.  The concept is simple: as wife Julie (Irene Dunne) packs to leave her husband Roger (Cary Grant), she plays the various records the two have collected over the years.  Each recording recalls the various phases of their lives: their chance meeting, their rather unexpected marriage, early years spent in the far east.  But they are unhappy in their inability to have a child--and so they return to the United States to adopt.  But their happiness ends in tragedy, a tragedy which neither seem able to surmount.The story is sentimental melodrama, of course, but it transcends its own genre.  George Stevens was one of the great directors of Hollywood's golden age--director of such diverse classics as A PLACE IN THE SUN, SHANE, and WOMAN OF THE YEAR.  In lesser hands the film might have been reduced to pure soap, but he strikes the perfect balance between charm and tearfulness.  The leads are equally perfect, with both Irene Dunne and Cary Grant (who were memorably teamed in such frantic screwball comedies MY FAVORITE WIFE and THE AWFUL TRUTH) discarding their broad comedic skills in favor of plausible humor and sincerity.  The supporting cast, which sports nice performances by the likes of Beulah Bondi and Edgar Buchanan, is also very fine, the script is quite good, and the cinematography both functional and elegant.But all this counts for nothing if you cannot actually stand to watch the truly awful DVD versions available.  And they really are that bad.  Over the years I've picked up several copies of this film released by several companies--Madacy, Laserlight, and most recently Front Row--and although the transfers vary a bit from company to company they are never more than extremely bad and quite often down-right unwatchable.  This is a film in desperate need of restoration, and until it receives that you're better off looking for it on the late-late show--for I can almost guarantee that the print you will find there will be superior to virtually any home-market release you can lay hands on.--GFT (Amazon reviewer)--",4,Memorable Film; Awful DVD,1053043200,"05 16, 2003",2003,2457,"['Directed', 'George', 'Stevens', 'starring', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'Irene', 'Dunne', 'PENNY', 'SERENADE', 'was', 'most', 'admired', 'films', '1941', 'film', 'now', 'drifted', 'public', 'domain', 'result', 'incredibly', 'dire', 'very', 'muddy', 'soundtrack', 'coupled', 'picture', 'shudders', 'shakes', 'so', 'can', 'barely', 'stand', 'look', 'it.This', 'great', 'pity', 'PENNY', 'SERENADE', 'fine', 'film', 'much', 'better', 'concept', 'simple', 'wife', 'Julie', 'Irene', 'Dunne', 'leave', 'husband', 'Roger', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'various', 'records', 'two', 'have', 'collected', 'years', 'recording', 'various', 'phases', 'lives', 'chance', 'meeting', 'rather', 'unexpected', 'marriage', 'early', 'years', 'spent', 'far', 'east', 'are', 'unhappy', 'inability', 'have', 'child', 'so', 'return', 'United', 'States', 'adopt', 'happiness', 'tragedy', 'tragedy', 'seem', 'able', 'surmount.The', 'story', 'sentimental', 'melodrama', 'course', 'own', 'genre', 'George', 'Stevens', 'was', 'one', 'great', 'directors', 'Hollywood', 'golden', 'age', 'director', 'such', 'diverse', 'classics', 'PLACE', 'IN', 'THE', 'SUN', 'SHANE', 'WOMAN', 'THE', 'YEAR', 'lesser', 'hands', 'film', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'reduced', 'pure', 'soap', 'perfect', 'balance', 'charm', 'tearfulness', 'leads', 'are', 'equally', 'perfect', 'Irene', 'Dunne', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'who', 'were', 'memorably', 'teamed', 'such', 'frantic', 'screwball', 'comedies', 'MY', 'FAVORITE', 'WIFE', 'THE', 'AWFUL', 'TRUTH', 'discarding', 'broad', 'comedic', 'skills', 'favor', 'plausible', 'humor', 'sincerity', 'supporting', 'cast', 'sports', 'nice', 'performances', 'likes', 'Beulah', 'Bondi', 'Edgar', 'Buchanan', 'also', 'very', 'fine', 'script', 'quite', 'good', 'cinematography', 'functional', 'elegant.But', 'counts', 'nothing', 'can', 'not', 'actually', 'stand', 'watch', 'truly', 'awful', 'DVD', 'versions', 'available', 'really', 'are', 'bad', 'years', ""'ve"", 'picked', 'up', 'several', 'copies', 'film', 'released', 'several', 'companies', 'Madacy', 'Laserlight', 'most', 'recently', 'Front', 'Row', 'transfers', 'vary', 'bit', 'company', 'company', 'are', 'never', 'more', 'extremely', 'bad', 'quite', 'often', 'down-right', 'unwatchable', 'film', 'desperate', 'need', 'restoration', ""'re"", 'better', 'off', 'looking', 'late-late', 'show', 'can', 'almost', 'guarantee', 'print', 'will', 'find', 'will', 'be', 'superior', 'virtually', 'home-market', 'release', 'can', 'lay', 'hands', 'on.', 'GFT', 'Amazon', 'reviewer']",N/A

Unfortunately, she and Cary end up in Japan, and while they are living there for a brief time, an earthquake takes place, the pregnant wife falls and she loses her child.Getting back to the States is tough, especially after she remarks that she'll never ever be able to have the dream of her life.  Cary's character is a self-styled publisher, and when &quot;Uncle Applejack,&quot; played by a sensitive Edgar Buchanan, enters the scene and suggests that Cary told him that he'd love to adopt (actually, Uncle Applejack sets up the whole thing), we're off on a new adventure for our couple.The adoption process is a tough one, and filled with many challenges, and it's this about the film - the rising above life's setbacks that makes it such a great film.What is intriguing about the way it is filmed, is that it uses the 78 LP spinning the songs of Miss Dunne's character who is reminiscing about the past, in that the movie opens with the couple all set to call it quits due to the death of their adopted child.

A husband who promises great achievements and does not deliver. A wife who is set into action by these promises, though she tends to be more realistic and to curb the fantasy in her husband's imagination. She unluckily loses her first baby in a miscarriage and even her ability to procreate. They finally move to the idea of adopting a child, which they do, and they get completely trapped in their entangling love for the child. But fate never strikes only once and this girl gets sick at the age of seven and dies. The couple unravels into a separation that is looming high over their future. It is when the wife is on the point of leaving her husband that a new opportunity to adopt a second child appears, a boy this time.

40350,A1L43KWWR05PCS,0782006795,Lawyeraau,"[0, 0]","This is a wonderfully sentimental melodrama, which is deftly directed by the venerable George Stevens. With its stellar cast, the film delivers a heartwarming story.The film opens onto a scene of a woman, Julie Adams (Irene Dunne), who is in the process of leaving her beloved  husband, Roger (Cary Grant). It seems that they are no longer able to communicate with one another, and their marriage has headed south in the wake of tragedy. Before she leaves, Julie puts a record album on the victrola, and suddenly memories of the marriage come flooding back.The viewer sees vignettes from the marriage in flashback, as Julie plays one old record after another. The memories allow the viewer to see how the formerly happy couple met. Fittingly, they met in a record store where Julie worked. Roger was a newspaper reporter at the time. Their meeting was quite romantic, and, of course, inevitably, they marry.When Roger is sent on assignment to Japan, Julie follows but so does tragedy. They return to the states and settle in the small town of Rosalia, California, where Roger tries his hand at publishing a small hometown newspaper. As a result of what happened in Japan, however,  they are unable to have children. Consequently,  a small cloud looms on their marital  horizon, only to be righted by their long time friend with the improbable name of Applejack Carney (Edgar Buchanan).Roger and Julie decide to adopt and do so with the help of a Ms. Oliver (Beulah Bondi), a kindly woman who is able to see the love that Julie and Roger would bring to a child in need of a home. So, five week old Trina comes into their lives and burrows into their hearts. There, she stays until tragedy, once again, strikes the household years later. This tragedy serves to bring the now unhappy couple to this impasse in their lives.Irene Dunne is simply sensational in the role of Julie, the woman who is the mainstay in the lives of those around her. She imbues the role with such warmth and emotion that the viewer can feel those emotions with her. Trust me when I tell you that you will need a box of tissues handy. It is definitely a five hanky tearjerker. Cary Grant, looking impossibly handsome, is wonderfully cast as the impulsive, easygoing, and impecunious Roger, who is brought down to terra firma by his well grounded wife, Julie, and finds happiness that he never thought possible when he became Trina's father.Edgar Buchanan is heartwarming as the friend and general factotum who is always around to pick up the pieces and help right what has gone wrong. Beulah Bondi is terrific as the well-meaning Ms. Oliver, who helps the Adams family achieve their dream. There are several children who play Trina at different stages in her life. All are wonderful, but the most adorable one is the one who plays the role of one year old Trina (Baby Jane Biffle). The viewer will understand fully why her adoptive parents are so besotted by her. This is a wonderful melodrama that will tug at one's heartstrings.

Generally speaking, outside of combat or engaging in a heroic endeavor, no average person willingly goes toward pain and suffering. Especially as a parent contemplating the loss of your child.Opens with one of Hollywood's classic movie tandems, and two of my favorite actors, Cary Grant and Irene Dunne portraying a married couple who desperately want children. The biological reason isn't relevant to the story, suffice to say that they cannot have their own. And in 1941, adoption was the only realistic option for the childless.Just as today, the process to legally adopt was challenging. A process that is intentionally meant to be difficult, not only to weed out unsuitable couples, but to demonstrate to the state your willingness to go to extremes - an indicator that you won't abandon your child once the adoption is complete.Roger and Juile Adams are such a couple.Dunne & Grant's well acknowledged on-screen chemistry and pure joy of performance working on this production is palpable. You genuinely feel like we're peeking into the lives of these two people and their little bundle of joy. Thus making this heart wrenching film so much more painful to watch.Can it be described as emotionally manipulative, deterministically cloying, etc? Sure. But, again, this was 1941. Applying twenty-first century cynicism isn't an honest argument against screening this production. So don't be a heartless fracker.If you want a sincere kick in the gut or need to cry your eyes out - this is your movie.Again, this is for me, the final time I will ever think about this incredible film.Movie Note:I see from several other reviews that this film is copyright free.

On the surface, it is a very clich&eacute; story but the actors and the music tremendously change this mediocre story into a masterpiece.The wonderful thing about music is how it affects people. This film is narrated by penny records that illustrate a certain period of time for the characters. Each is significant to the section it belongs to. The songs range from the romantic, ""You Were Meant for Me"" to the traditional ""Happy Birthday.""

Survive an Earthquake. Loose a child. Adopt another. Tragedy besets them, but in the end they are able to overcome it. The movie is mostly told through musical flashbacks thanks to rotating RPMs and is one of the first films to ever have used the soundtrack as an intrical part of the film. The movie is a notch above most other melodramatic tearjerkers and there's one big reason for that:  Cary Grant.Cary Grant is the man. What more does one need to say?  Sure Irene Dunn does a good job in this melodramatic tale about a husband and wife who live through an earthquake in Japan, the loss of an unborn child, and the adoption of another.  Of course, the actor who plays Applejack steals many scenes, serving as the wise fool in this Shakespearean-type romance as his character balances everything that occurs. Nevertheless, through all of Uncle Applejack's helpful advice and Irene Dunn's moving tears, it's Cary Grant who carries the picture.  Grant nailed this performance of Roger and once again illustrated how great of an actor he truly was. A lot of actors would have been tempted to delve into melodramatic play-acting, but not Grant. Even though this is a tear-jerker melodrama and he has some really cheesy lines in some scenes, Grant makes the whole thing seem plausible and feel realistic. I admit that I am a huge fan of Cary Grant, but I keep digging up these old movies he made, hoping to find a film that he totally flops in. So far, I haven't found any.  Grant was just a notch above the rest and could make any movie more enjoyable just by being in it. It's worth more than a penny to see his performance in this serenade.",5,"You the man, Cary Grant.",1070236800,"12 1, 2003",2003,1768,"['PENNY', 'SERENADE', 'story', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'love', 'newspaper', 'reporter', 'get', 'married', 'Move', 'Japan', 'Survive', 'Earthquake', 'Loose', 'child', 'Adopt', 'Tragedy', 'end', 'are', 'able', 'overcome', 'movie', 'mostly', 'told', 'musical', 'flashbacks', 'thanks', 'rotating', 'RPMs', 'one', 'first', 'films', 'ever', 'have', 'used', 'soundtrack', 'intrical', 'part', 'film', 'movie', 'notch', 'most', 'other', 'melodramatic', 'tearjerkers', 'one', 'big', 'reason', 'Cary', 'Grant.Cary', 'Grant', 'man', 'What', 'more', 'one', 'need', 'say', 'Sure', 'Irene', 'Dunn', 'good', 'job', 'melodramatic', 'tale', 'husband', 'wife', 'who', 'live', 'earthquake', 'Japan', 'loss', 'unborn', 'child', 'adoption', 'course', 'actor', 'who', 'Applejack', 'steals', 'many', 'scenes', 'serving', 'wise', 'fool', 'Shakespearean-type', 'romance', 'character', 'balances', 'everything', 'Nevertheless', 'Uncle', 'Applejack', 'helpful', 'advice', 'Irene', 'Dunn', 'moving', 'tears', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'who', 'picture', 'Grant', 'nailed', 'performance', 'Roger', 'once', 'again', 'illustrated', 'how', 'great', 'actor', 'truly', 'was', 'lot', 'actors', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'tempted', 'delve', 'melodramatic', 'play-acting', 'not', 'Grant', 'Even', 'tear-jerker', 'melodrama', 'really', 'cheesy', 'lines', 'scenes', 'Grant', 'whole', 'thing', 'seem', 'plausible', 'feel', 'realistic', 'admit', 'am', 'huge', 'fan', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'keep', 'digging', 'up', 'old', 'movies', 'made', 'hoping', 'find', 'film', 'totally', 'So', 'far', 'have', ""n't"", 'found', 'Grant', 'was', 'just', 'notch', 'rest', 'could', 'make', 'movie', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'just', 'being', 'more', 'penny', 'see', 'performance', 'serenade']",N/A
