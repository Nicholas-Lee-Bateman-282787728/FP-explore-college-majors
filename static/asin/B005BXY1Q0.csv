Unfortunately it seems this was the wrong place to start and there may have been better choices available.  First off, my nephew likes the music CD I gave him the prior year so it seemed like a good time to give what appeared to be a Christmas themed VeggieTales DVD as he is now around two and a half years old.  We all sat to watch this gift DVD and I could tell it wasn't being received well by anyone in the room including my nephew.  The adults were yawning, one actually fell asleep watching it, I tried to enjoy it as it was my gift, but found it hard to like this story as well as the jokes all fell flat and the story and characters were all hard to like.  My nephew kept asking to watch Mickey Mouse instead while this was on.  A clear disappointment and it will be hard to give any future gifts in this series after this poor introduction to the VeggieTales movies.  Avoid this one and go with the Rankin and Bass version which I found to be a much better Drummer Boy story told with a heart and better representation of the true meaning of Christmas.",2,Uninspired and Forgetable,1324857600,"12 26, 2011",2011,1226,"['was', 'hoping', 'introduce', 'nephew', 'family', 'VeggieTales', 'series', 'movies', 'selected', 'starting', 'DVD', 'give', 'gift', 'unpreviewed', 'Unfortunately', 'was', 'wrong', 'place', 'start', 'there', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'choices', 'available', 'First', 'nephew', 'music', 'CD', 'gave', 'prior', 'year', 'seemed', 'good', 'time', 'give', 'what', 'appeared', 'be', 'Christmas', 'themed', 'VeggieTales', 'DVD', 'now', 'around', 'two', 'half', 'years', 'old', 'sat', 'watch', 'gift', 'DVD', 'could', 'tell', 'was', ""n't"", 'being', 'received', 'well', 'anyone', 'room', 'including', 'nephew', 'adults', 'were', 'yawning', 'one', 'actually', 'fell', 'asleep', 'watching', 'tried', 'enjoy', 'was', 'gift', 'found', 'hard', 'like', 'story', 'as', 'well', 'jokes', 'fell', 'flat', 'story', 'characters', 'were', 'hard', 'like', 'nephew', 'kept', 'asking', 'watch', 'Mickey', 'Mouse', 'instead', 'was', 'clear', 'disappointment', 'will', 'be', 'hard', 'give', 'future', 'gifts', 'series', 'poor', 'introduction', 'VeggieTales', 'movies', 'Avoid', 'one', 'go', 'Rankin', 'Bass', 'version', 'found', 'be', 'much', 'better', 'Drummer', 'Boy', 'story', 'told', 'heart', 'better', 'representation', 'true', 'meaning', 'Christmas']",The Little Drummer Boy

I was pretty disappointed, though, that in some of the recent DVDs they don't play the whole theme song. But many shows have done that and it's a little thing in comparison to all the awesome things that the shows are full of.The Little Drummer Boy stars Junior Asparagus, who I really love by the way. He has always been one of my favorite characters. He's just too cute for words. Most if not all people know about the little drummer boy. It's just such a classic song, so putting it to video is pretty amazing. One of my favorite parts of this DVD is how in the story portion they have two French peas named ""May"" and ""Wee"" - that was so clever to me. Another great part is the animals in the story - sheep, donkey and camel - that ended up doing a little dance in the movie which was so cute to me.Now Junior is really getting into drumming, so when Pa Grape tells him a Christmas story, he picks the perfectly fitting story of Aaron as a drummer. It's such a great way to show kids the story of baby Jesus. It's not totally all about the Christmas story, but it shows a different perspective of someone who didn't know anything about Jesus being born and suddenly coming across him from somewhere else. It's a great story for sure.The silly song portion of the movie was fun to watch for sure. I knew about the 8 Polish Foods of Christmas song before. Seeing that come to video was super amusing.",4,great and amusing.,1361923200,"02 27, 2013",2013,1493,"['theme', 'song', 'always', 'favorite', 'mine', 'been', 'first', 'watched', 'VeggieTales', 'was', 'pretty', 'disappointed', 'though', 'recent', 'DVDs', 'do', ""n't"", 'play', 'whole', 'theme', 'song', 'many', 'shows', 'have', 'done', 'little', 'thing', 'comparison', 'awesome', 'things', 'shows', 'are', 'full', 'of.The', 'Little', 'Drummer', 'Boy', 'Junior', 'Asparagus', 'who', 'really', 'love', 'way', 'always', 'been', 'one', 'favorite', 'characters', 'just', 'too', 'cute', 'words', 'Most', 'not', 'people', 'know', 'little', 'drummer', 'boy', 'just', 'such', 'classic', 'song', 'putting', 'video', 'pretty', 'amazing', 'One', 'favorite', 'parts', 'DVD', 'how', 'story', 'portion', 'have', 'two', 'French', 'peas', 'named', 'May', 'Wee', 'was', 'so', 'clever', 'great', 'part', 'animals', 'story', 'sheep', 'donkey', 'camel', 'ended', 'up', 'doing', 'little', 'dance', 'movie', 'was', 'so', 'cute', 'me.Now', 'Junior', 'really', 'getting', 'drumming', 'so', 'when', 'Pa', 'Grape', 'Christmas', 'story', 'perfectly', 'fitting', 'story', 'Aaron', 'drummer', 'such', 'great', 'way', 'show', 'kids', 'story', 'baby', 'Jesus', 'not', 'totally', 'Christmas', 'story', 'different', 'perspective', 'someone', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'anything', 'Jesus', 'being', 'born', 'suddenly', 'coming', 'somewhere', 'else', 'great', 'story', 'sure.The', 'silly', 'song', 'portion', 'movie', 'was', 'fun', 'watch', 'sure', 'knew', '8', 'Polish', 'Foods', 'Christmas', 'song', 'before', 'Seeing', 'come', 'video', 'was', 'super', 'amusing']",The Little Drummer Boy

While his parents go out Christmas shopping, he is supposed to go caroling with his friends, but a mix up leaves him home with Grandpa (Pa Grape).  Mad at his friends, Junior intends to sulk, but Grandpa decides to tell him the story of the little drummer boy.Back in the time of the Romans lived a little boy named Aaron (Junior again) who had a happy home life and a gift with a drum that could make animals dance.  When his family home is destroyed, he sets out with just the animals left, determined to live as isolated a life as possible.  Will he stay angry or will he have an encounter with the newborn king?This episode appears to be based on a story, or at least inspired by it, but I'm not familiar with the source material.  The story is very tragic at the beginning, and you can really understand Aaron's anger, a theme that is played out through the entire story.  And yet, when the climax comes, it is suddenly all washed away - it's just too easy.  The resolution needed more context to the story.Along the way, we do get some great humor with the characters that Aaron meets along the way.  I especially loved the Star Wars references at one point.They've finally animated ""The 8 Polish Foods of Christmas"" from the mid-90's Christmas CD, and it's still a hoot.For much of this DVD, I was enjoying the story despite the sad beginning.
