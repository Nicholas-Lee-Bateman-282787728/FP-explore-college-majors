1329014,A2PV6GK1HV54Y9,B0036TGTDE,ADRIENNE MILLER,"[0, 0]","Blue Valentine starring Ryan Gosling and Michelle Williams is a hard and realistic look at the collapse of a marriage. Gosling and Williams play Dean and Cindy, a young married couple who's days of intense passion and love are quickly fading. You can feel Cindy's smoldering feelings of disgust for Dean, while Dean tries his best to hold on to a relationship that might be unsaveable. Blue Valentine travels back and forth to past and present time. We get to see how Dean and Cindy met and fell in love and how a huge decision changed their lives forever. Gosling and Williams are perfection, I can't think of two other actors who could've played these characters better?

He was superb also as Dean in Blue Valentine. Michelle Williams also did extremely well as Cindy, making her deserving of her Oscar nod. This would be a five star for some because the overall concept of the end of a relationship was a good one, but for me, the story never focused fully on their relationship. Yes, Dean and Cindy married and both seemed to love their daughter. But there was never enough shown beyond their physical attraction to each other that made their relationship seem real to me. There was no partnership, no shared values, no life-changing event that triggered hidden fears or emotions. Each had their own individual struggles that the other seemed to ignore. I was never really given the opportunity to delve into each individual struggle. Cindy was a medical student and was from a family with a domineering father who had a boyfriend who wrestled. That is about all we know of Michelle Williams' character. Dean was a high school dropout who appeared to be an alcoholic who smoked a lot.I watched part of the special features to see if I could find out why the story was so well acted, but still fell short of a five star rating for me. The director (who also wrote much of the story), Derek Cianfrance, explained that he had always tried to understand the dissolution of his own parents' marriage and wanted to explore the end of a relationship in film. He, Ryan Gosling, and Michelle Williams, had worked on the concept for years before filming began. Ryan and Michelle were also executive producers. I think that when many relationships end, those involved and those who witness the end of the relationship may not fully understand why it ended. In that sense, the movie conveyed that sense of bewilderment extremely well.My recommendation is to rent or borrow it before buying it. It was definitely good enough for me to keep thinking of it long after watching it and I will no doubt view it again. If it appeals to you, it will rate 4 or 5 stars. If you want all the answers and a deep understanding of the characters and their relationship, this movie does not show those elements. That is its strength, but also why I could not give it the full 5 stars. Perhaps I just like fairy tale endings instead of bitter realities.",4,A great concept and well-acted,1307318400,"06 6, 2011",2011,2378,"['am', 'fan', 'Ryan', 'Gosling', 'was', 'excited', 'see', 'unusual', 'role', 'was', 'superb', 'Lars', 'Real', 'Girl', 'was', 'superb', 'also', 'Dean', 'Blue', 'Valentine', 'Michelle', 'Williams', 'also', 'did', 'extremely', 'well', 'Cindy', 'making', 'deserving', 'Oscar', 'nod', 'would', 'be', 'five', 'star', 'overall', 'concept', 'end', 'relationship', 'was', 'good', 'one', 'story', 'never', 'focused', 'fully', 'relationship', 'Yes', 'Dean', 'Cindy', 'married', 'seemed', 'love', 'daughter', 'was', 'never', 'enough', 'shown', 'physical', 'attraction', 'other', 'made', 'relationship', 'seem', 'real', 'was', 'partnership', 'shared', 'values', 'life-changing', 'event', 'triggered', 'hidden', 'fears', 'emotions', 'had', 'own', 'individual', 'struggles', 'other', 'seemed', 'ignore', 'was', 'never', 'really', 'given', 'opportunity', 'delve', 'individual', 'struggle', 'Cindy', 'was', 'medical', 'student', 'was', 'family', 'domineering', 'father', 'who', 'had', 'boyfriend', 'who', 'wrestled', 'know', 'Michelle', 'Williams', 'character', 'Dean', 'was', 'high', 'school', 'dropout', 'who', 'appeared', 'be', 'alcoholic', 'who', 'smoked', 'lot.I', 'watched', 'part', 'special', 'features', 'see', 'could', 'find', 'out', 'why', 'story', 'was', 'so', 'well', 'acted', 'still', 'fell', 'short', 'five', 'star', 'rating', 'director', 'who', 'also', 'wrote', 'much', 'story', 'Derek', 'Cianfrance', 'explained', 'had', 'always', 'tried', 'understand', 'dissolution', 'own', 'parents', 'marriage', 'wanted', 'explore', 'end', 'relationship', 'film', 'Ryan', 'Gosling', 'Michelle', 'Williams', 'had', 'worked', 'concept', 'years', 'filming', 'began', 'Ryan', 'Michelle', 'were', 'also', 'executive', 'producers', 'think', 'when', 'many', 'relationships', 'end', 'involved', 'who', 'witness', 'end', 'relationship', 'may', 'not', 'fully', 'understand', 'why', 'ended', 'sense', 'movie', 'conveyed', 'sense', 'bewilderment', 'extremely', 'well.My', 'recommendation', 'rent', 'borrow', 'buying', 'was', 'definitely', 'good', 'enough', 'keep', 'thinking', 'long', 'watching', 'will', 'doubt', 'view', 'again', 'appeals', 'will', 'rate', '4', '5', 'stars', 'want', 'answers', 'deep', 'understanding', 'characters', 'relationship', 'movie', 'not', 'show', 'elements', 'strength', 'also', 'why', 'could', 'not', 'give', 'full', '5', 'stars', 'Perhaps', 'just', 'fairy', 'tale', 'endings', 'instead', 'bitter', 'realities']",N/A

It's about a relationship that is coming apart at the seams and the movie cross-cuts between the beginning and end of the relationship to point to the stark differences. What once appeared whimsical and fun, is now just sad and grating...The acting is very true to life and gritty so making this an emotionally dark film, not for every one. The Director Derek Cianfrance asked Michelle Williams and Ryan Gosling, the actors portraying the couple, to live together for a month or so before beginning shooting the film. They did dishes and cooked and ate together like a real couple, and the chemistry developed. You can almost taste the raw and visecral nature of the emotion in the film, especially their despair when they realize the colors in the relationship have shifted to darker and dismal tones. The camera work is brilliant as it gives us extreme closeups of the actors faces and features which lead us into their world and we can hear them thinking. It also does not try to be kind to them when filming sexual scenes, giving the movie it's raw and organic quality.The hues in the movie seem darker too as their relationship has lost its color and is beginning to decay and decompose. Neither of the actors held back, Ryan Gosling is supreme as is Michelle Williams who gave a brave and unfettered performance and was nominated for the Oscars and Golden Globe for this role and won several other awards.Blue Valentine draws us in by moving between the couples' past and present and makes us examine along with them why their relationship is now decomposing. I can only remember some French films that have previously portrayed this raw emotion. It's not a comfortable film to watch, as it's about the gray shades of bitterness and despair in a relationship with no hope of being resurrected but it is one that leaves a strong impression due to its brutal honesty.",5,"Stunning and raw portrait of a love relationship falling apart, brilliantly acted and captured on camera.",1307923200,"06 13, 2011",2011,1944,"['movie', 'one', 'best', ""'ve"", 'seen', '2010', 'had', 'get', 'DVD', 'relationship', 'coming', 'apart', 'seams', 'movie', 'cross-cuts', 'beginning', 'end', 'relationship', 'point', 'stark', 'differences', 'What', 'once', 'appeared', 'whimsical', 'fun', 'now', 'just', 'sad', 'grating', 'acting', 'very', 'true', 'life', 'gritty', 'so', 'making', 'emotionally', 'dark', 'film', 'not', 'one', 'Director', 'Derek', 'Cianfrance', 'asked', 'Michelle', 'Williams', 'Ryan', 'Gosling', 'actors', 'portraying', 'couple', 'live', 'together', 'month', 'so', 'beginning', 'shooting', 'film', 'did', 'dishes', 'cooked', 'ate', 'together', 'real', 'couple', 'chemistry', 'developed', 'can', 'almost', 'taste', 'raw', 'visecral', 'nature', 'emotion', 'film', 'especially', 'despair', 'when', 'realize', 'colors', 'relationship', 'have', 'shifted', 'darker', 'dismal', 'tones', 'camera', 'work', 'brilliant', 'extreme', 'closeups', 'actors', 'features', 'lead', 'world', 'can', 'hear', 'thinking', 'also', 'not', 'try', 'be', 'kind', 'when', 'filming', 'sexual', 'scenes', 'giving', 'movie', 'raw', 'organic', 'quality.The', 'hues', 'movie', 'seem', 'darker', 'too', 'relationship', 'lost', 'color', 'beginning', 'decay', 'decompose', 'actors', 'held', 'back', 'Ryan', 'Gosling', 'supreme', 'Michelle', 'Williams', 'who', 'gave', 'brave', 'unfettered', 'performance', 'was', 'nominated', 'Oscars', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'role', 'won', 'several', 'other', 'awards.Blue', 'Valentine', 'moving', 'couples', 'past', 'present', 'examine', 'why', 'relationship', 'now', 'decomposing', 'can', 'only', 'remember', 'French', 'films', 'have', 'previously', 'portrayed', 'raw', 'emotion', 'not', 'comfortable', 'film', 'watch', 'gray', 'shades', 'bitterness', 'despair', 'relationship', 'hope', 'being', 'resurrected', 'one', 'strong', 'impression', 'due', 'brutal', 'honesty']",N/A
1329019,A24IJY3V0804WJ,B0036TGTDE,Amit Talpade,"[0, 1]","This is a story about a marriage that is nearing its end, only awaiting the final verdict of its demise by the couple. In Blue Valentine, there is no beginning, end or middle in the narration of this tragedy, the scenes shifting back and forth between the happier days (the past) and the sad present. There are many scenes that reveal these fissures, the couple arguing about the correct way to serve oatmeal to their only daughter or the reserved anger over the realization that a simple act of locking the yard door could have saved the family dog, Megan. Then there are the faces always tense and worn with age, full of pensiveness and trouble. Dean (Ryan Gosling) and Cindy (Michelle Williams) are the married couple who are drifting apart due to many reasons, the very past, broken homes and bad marriages that they both tried to run away from is catching up with them. Cindy is full of resentment that her husband has become a functional alcoholic and has chosen a life of menial labor and that she has become the primary breadwinner. That she had to put her dreams of becoming a doctor on the backburner because of the unwanted pregnancy. Although theirs was a union of equals, but in many ways unequal too, with the seeds of dissolution sown at the beginning.Michelle Williams ( my favorite actress) and Ryan Gosling give one of the most outstanding performances of the year. In each frame they are superb, the happier times capture their youth and careless romance and the present day reveal their pain. Both are such outstanding performers that they nail this role effortlessly. In a scene, when Gosling barges in to Williams's office and acts like a jerk, one cannot help but feel sorry for this guy or sadness for her pain. This may be a very depressing story of a marriage in ruins but still hopeful because it makes you protect what you have even more. This is a fantastic movie with great performances.

1329020,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B0036TGTDE,Andrew Ellington,"[5, 7]","There are moments in `Blue Valentine' that feel so raw and so affecting that you can't help but feel uncomfortable while watching it.  I remember sitting there in the theater and actually getting the urge to leave because I felt like I was intruding on an intimate conversation; one that was laced with aggression.While `Blue Valentine' is undoubtedly depressing and uncomfortable, it culminates into one of the most passionate and ultimately `special' films I've seen in a long time.It's brutally honest, and I respect it immensely for that.Yes, there are no happy endings in `Blue Valentine', which is only one aspect that sticks out so strongly.  Following a young couple, Dean and Cindy, the film focuses on two moments in their relationship; the beginning and the end.  Splicing together fragments of their time together, the film brilliantly contrasts their happy moments with their unhappy ones.  We see them bitterly argue in the car and then watch them flirt bashfully and hesitantly on a train.  We watch them resist each other sexually and then watch them completely give in to each other's advances.  The way that the film is constructed is flawless, layering each emotion with such care and precision.The truth of the matter is that relationships are not perfect.  Love is not infallible.  Life is not gracious and so hard times can fracture even the purest of loves.  What Dean and Cindy had was not special, it was authentic.  It was natural.  It represents what we all could have right now.  Life plays dirty little tricks on us and causes us to fray at the edges, and that's exactly what happened to Dean and Cindy.But like Dean frantically pleads; you promised `for better or for worse'; right?`Blue Valentine' is technically flawless.  The script is sharp and beautifully fleshed out, even in the moments that are not explained.  While we do not see the entire relationship, we see enough `between the lines' to begin to fill in the blanks.  The film is breathlessly edited (those moments just linger) and the cinematography is fantastic (so claustrophobic, so poignant).  But this film is all about those two lead performances.  Both Michelle Williams and Ryan Gosling are BEYOND reproach here.  They emote so much, and they each have to tackle two sides of love (that whole `better' and `worse' thing) and they do it effortlessly.  The way that they can dote on one another and then practically seethe at the mouth is astonishing to watch.I would not be surprised if they remain my favorite performances of this next decade.So, while `Blue Valentine' may be hard to watch, it is a very poignant and universally important film.  It doesn't skirt around the obvious but gives us an inside look at the cracks within the marital bond.  Anyone who's been married (or who still is married) will identify with some of the feelings (or maybe even all of them) floating around the screen.  Marriage is not easy, and people are not easy, and films like `Blue Valentine' help us to see that we are not alone.",5,So blue...,1306195200,"05 24, 2011",2011,3018,"['are', 'moments', 'Blue', 'Valentine', 'feel', 'so', 'raw', 'so', 'affecting', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'uncomfortable', 'watching', 'remember', 'sitting', 'there', 'theater', 'actually', 'getting', 'urge', 'leave', 'felt', 'was', 'intruding', 'intimate', 'conversation', 'one', 'was', 'laced', 'aggression.While', 'Blue', 'Valentine', 'undoubtedly', 'depressing', 'uncomfortable', 'one', 'most', 'passionate', 'ultimately', 'special', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'long', 'time.It', 'brutally', 'honest', 'respect', 'immensely', 'that.Yes', 'are', 'happy', 'endings', 'Blue', 'Valentine', 'only', 'one', 'aspect', 'out', 'so', 'strongly', 'Following', 'young', 'couple', 'Dean', 'Cindy', 'film', 'two', 'moments', 'relationship', 'beginning', 'end', 'Splicing', 'together', 'fragments', 'time', 'together', 'film', 'brilliantly', 'happy', 'moments', 'unhappy', 'ones', 'see', 'bitterly', 'argue', 'car', 'then', 'watch', 'flirt', 'bashfully', 'hesitantly', 'train', 'watch', 'resist', 'other', 'sexually', 'then', 'watch', 'completely', 'give', 'other', 'advances', 'way', 'film', 'constructed', 'flawless', 'layering', 'emotion', 'such', 'care', 'precision.The', 'truth', 'matter', 'relationships', 'are', 'not', 'perfect', 'Love', 'not', 'infallible', 'Life', 'not', 'gracious', 'so', 'hard', 'times', 'can', 'fracture', 'even', 'purest', 'loves', 'What', 'Dean', 'Cindy', 'had', 'was', 'not', 'special', 'was', 'authentic', 'was', 'natural', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'right', 'now', 'Life', 'dirty', 'little', 'tricks', 'fray', 'edges', 'exactly', 'what', 'happened', 'Dean', 'Cindy.But', 'Dean', 'frantically', 'promised', 'better', 'worse', 'right', 'Blue', 'Valentine', 'technically', 'flawless', 'script', 'sharp', 'beautifully', 'fleshed', 'out', 'even', 'moments', 'are', 'not', 'explained', 'do', 'not', 'see', 'entire', 'relationship', 'see', 'enough', 'lines', 'begin', 'fill', 'blanks', 'film', 'breathlessly', 'edited', 'moments', 'just', 'linger', 'cinematography', 'fantastic', 'so', 'claustrophobic', 'so', 'poignant', 'film', 'two', 'lead', 'performances', 'Michelle', 'Williams', 'Ryan', 'Gosling', 'are', 'BEYOND', 'reproach', 'here', 'emote', 'so', 'much', 'have', 'tackle', 'two', 'sides', 'love', 'whole', 'better', 'worse', 'thing', 'do', 'effortlessly', 'way', 'can', 'dote', 'one', 'then', 'practically', 'seethe', 'mouth', 'astonishing', 'watch.I', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'surprised', 'remain', 'favorite', 'performances', 'next', 'decade.So', 'Blue', 'Valentine', 'may', 'be', 'hard', 'watch', 'very', 'poignant', 'universally', 'important', 'film', ""n't"", 'skirt', 'obvious', 'inside', 'look', 'cracks', 'marital', 'bond', 'Anyone', 'who', 'been', 'married', 'who', 'still', 'married', 'will', 'identify', 'feelings', 'maybe', 'even', 'floating', 'screen', 'Marriage', 'not', 'easy', 'people', 'are', 'not', 'easy', 'films', 'Blue', 'Valentine', 'help', 'see', 'are', 'not', 'alone']",N/A
1329021,A3EUSH8DPW75LR,B0036TGTDE,barry,"[2, 3]","Some viewers are having a hard time with this film and it is actually understood.  For decades Hollywood has been dishing out the fairy tale love story film with the happily ever after ending or the chick flick films perfect for date night.  These are great for escape or date nights but in no way based on reality.  But film is an art form meant to educate the audience and show them realities and subjects they may not want to see but need to.  For some this film will be too depressing and too dreary.  But this is the first film in decades to so fully and realistically immerse itself into the showing of a relationship that half of this country could be going through.  We have Cindy and Dean who are married with a daughter Frankie.  From the beginning of the film who know all is not well.  There is constant tension between the couple, fights are picked, nasty things are said.  There is passion still so strong but now it comes out as true distaste.  This is our couple years after they met, fell in love and got married.  The story is shown with the problems of present day and flashbacks to the period when they met and fell in love.There is no magic dust to spread over this couple to make all well.  Even when they met all was not perfect.  Cindy came from a verbally abusive household and was pregnant by her current boyfriend when she meets Dean, a high school drop-out working for a moving company.  Dean pursued Cindy and it takes a while to work his way into her good graces.  The story of their growing love is very believable, sometimes sweet but always has its own problems.  In the wrong hands this film could have been a disaster but with writer/director Derek Cianfrance and more secifically the outstanding, superb performances of Michelle Williams and Ryan Gosling this film becomes a masterpiece.  Ms. Williams and Mr. Gosling inhabit these characters so fully the feel at times is like a documentary rather than a movie.  This is far beyond great acting.  Their immersion into these characters puts on the screen emotions so raw, honest and true that the audience often feels like the are spying on a real couple.  There is much ad lib here and the couple lived together for a lengthy time to truly feel like a couple.  These performances show the actors at perhaps the highlight and pinnacle of both their already impeccably impressive careers.In the story the couple decides to spend a night together at a hotel to try and rekindle some spark.  The story is simple and told moreso through the emotions and lives they lead.  There is explicit sex here that plays a major part in the story.  It's not always pretty and truly shows how sometimes sex and affection becomes just routine and mechanical, truly unemotional.  Love means different things to Dean and Cindy and when the film ends there is no true resolution to their relationship.  The viewer will be truly emotionally drained and rather stunned.  But in the hands of Cianfrance the viewer is guided and handled carefully with the fine line never being crossed.  And the lasting impression this film will leave is true respect and admiration for the mutually superb, intense, realistic and ground breaking acting of Michelle Williams and Ryan Gosling.

Thrilled in the sense that the film not only has great acting but the storyline, simple as it maybe, is so engaging, and moving, that you can't help but be affected. You're invited into the lives of two individuals and you want to try and understand why it doesn't work out. After all, living in the United States, where half of all marriages end in divorce, how many young couples make the right decision to marry?Does anyone in the world remember Juno?  The most overrated piece of tripe I've ever seen. And you recall how ridiculous the entire abortion sequence was?Then you go see a film like Blue Valentine, and suddenly you are brought back down to REALITY, and you witness how painful an experience an abortion can be and with it (even an abortive attempt), you physically feel the emotional spikes of both individuals and you say to yourself, is this a movie? Or is this actually a couple somewhere in a small town in Pennsylvania today going through the exact same experience, right now?Yes, Gosling and Williams brilliantly capture their characters raison d'etre for living and it's difficult to lay blame on either of them when trying to come to terms with the dissolution of their relationship. In some ways, I was more upset at Williams character because she shows her true colors by marrying Gosling's character even though it's very questionable how much she truly loved him. Ultimately, you come away with the conclusion that she married him because of her unwanted pregnancy.Goesling's character doesn't possess ambition. He's satisfied with the status-quo and his lot in life. He's a painter, with a daughter, and a wife whom he adores. What is there to complain about??But the human story is one of pathos and ecstasy. We just aren't a boring species, folks. And this film carefully mines its way through the emotional lives of this couple using careful flashback sequences to show how some of us start in life but evolve later to recognize the deception of our own decisions and are then frustrated when we can't have our beginning back again.I can't recommend this film enough, especially if you want to a good cry! Crying is so cathartic, folks!  It's good for the soul to cry every once in a blue moon. And it's a crying for the loss of love. I've met some individuals in life who are not lucky in love, have not found their soul mate. These people are successful in other ways but not in love. Love captures our emotional imagination like nothing else. And Blue Valentine reminds us just how fragile each and everyone of us are.

Derek Cianfrance's ""Blue Valentine,"" is an intense and unforgettable film that will make you value or re-examine your life.The film stars Ryan Gosling as Dean, and Michelle Williams as Cindy, a married couple with a young daughter, Frankie (Faith Wladyka), and it begins when they have been together for a while. However, we immediately can feel that things are not well between them, that they are in a crisis period. They are working class parents - she is a nurse, he works in a packing and moving company -, and are on a daily struggle to live the American dream. Life goes on until Cindy accidentally meets Bobby (Mike Vogel), an ex-boyfriend, while doing grocery shopping. Nothing happens then, but when Cindy tells Dean about it, it sparks bad memories that will create great friction in the already-troubled marriage. Indeed, we are then taken to the past, when Cindy was dating her then boyfriend Bobby, and how she eventually meets Dean. We realize that both their families were dysfunctional, which in part shaped their future. From then on the movie goes back and forth, until we are taken to the dramatic end.""Blue Valentine"" is crude in almost every sense of the word, including sex - real life at its best. It is a penetrating story about disintegration, which can happen to any of us, and how the past sometimes haunts the present. Both Gosling and Williams are superb, and they act their evolution as a married couple to perfection. The photography by Andrij Parekh greatly supports the story, and Williams deservedly received an Academy Award Nomination for Best Actress.

It is a story of love that has gone (if it was even there in the first place). Two complex characters marry and evolve, each at their own speed, so that after several years they have nothing in common anymore. The pace of the film is slow, the dialogue sparse. The actors definitely succeeded in their roles, as the movie made me feel quite uncomfortable at times. I liked Ryan Gosling's character, even when he behaved badly. He is shown as kind of a loser, but he is actually the one who gets life. The wife's character was unlikeable and manipulative. She has outgrown him, she is more intelligent than he and the main support for the family comes from her work. She clearly wants more from life than she currently has. I had the feeling if these two characters would just sit down and ""share"" some of their aspirations for their family all would be well, but this was not what the movie intended to portray.The cinematography was a bit off-putting to me; gloomy, dark, shaky. It reminded my of an Italian movie that I had seen when growing up in Europe in the 50's - ""Bicycle Thieves"". It had that same gloomy, dingy, frayed at the seams feeling.

Tom Waits has a song with that title, and you get the typical Tom Waits gangster/hipster fringe characters. It was that, in a way, but much more bleak. It was a tradgedy, really. In some ways you might compare it to Leaving Las Vegas, where Nicholas Cage celebrated not drinking as a way of killing himself, but rather, killing himself as a way of drinking. Gosling's character was an alcoholic who was also rapidly unraveling, but he had a good heart and just wanted to be a good husband and father to their child. Williams, on the other hand, was a workaholic, trying to pass medical school and be a nurse, but too tired and busy to be a very good mother. She barely makes it in time to her daughter's recital. She leaves the gate open and lets Megan, the family dog, escape, and she was too rushed to prepare instant oatmeal for her daughter's breakfast. She just adds water--cold tap water--not taking the time to even read the directions and see that you are supposed to boil the water first. Hey, it says it's instant Oatmeal.It is really a bleak tale, but the acting is very good. From the two leads of course, but also from the supporting cast. Gosling in particular goes for broke, going from a young man recently dropped out of high school and working for a moving company, to a bloated middle aged alcoholic with a receding hairline. He even sings and plays the ukelele, while remaining totally in character, with Michelle Williams tap dancing in one of the film's most poignant moments. This film is no 'Notebook' though I admit that I didn't actually see that one, but I gather that he was very romantic, even earning a shout out in Andy Samberg and Chris Parnell's rap parody, Lazy Sunday Afternoon. I did however catch him in The Believer, as a young Jewish man who joins a neo nazi group, and in Lars and The Real Girl, where he portrays a simple man in love with a love doll. He has quite a range, and extends it even further with this portrayal. I have already compared this film and Gosling's role to Nicholas Cage's Oscar winning performance in Leaving Las Vegas, but it also reminded me of the damaged character played by Adam Sandler in Punch Drunk Love. Believe it or not, the Sandler comparison is a compliment, but I'll take it further and say that Gosling's acting has both Sandler and Cage beat.Williams was a perfect match for Gosling, as thesbians, if not a perfect match for their characters' marriage. She was also good in the independent film Wendy and Lucy even if the film itself wasn't that good and nothing much happened in it (lost dogs seem to be a recurring motif for Williams), and she was good in Brokeback Mountain, even if you don't really remember her because that film wasn't really about women (Anne Hathaway was equally forgetable), but she is very good in Blue Valentine. She is unforgetable in that. Neither she nor Gosling is particularly sympathetic, nor are they trying to be. That takes courage, because everyone wants to be liked. They are both very brave here, not holding back anything. We first met Michelle Williams as the bad girl Jen Lindley on Dawson's Creek. Besides the above mentioned  roles she was also impressive in The Hottest State (An Ethan Hawke vanity project), Synecdoche, New York (Charlie Kaufman's directorial debut), and Martin Scorsese's Shutter Island.The film jumps around in time, hinging on perhaps a phone call or some other event that suddenly reminds a character of their past, and of how they eventually ended up in their current situation. The phone rings, but someone from a different time and place answers. I really like the way it was edited, even if at times it was hard to follow the story. I also liked the way the director created such a bleak and hopeless atmosphere, a sense of impending doom, even though they were basically going through a typical marriage. And they lived happily ever after--NOT.Compare and ContrastPunch-Drunk LoveLeaving Las VegasNotable Roles of Ryan GoslingThe NotebookBelieverLars and the Real GirlNotable Roles of Michelle WilliamsBrokeback Mountain (Widescreen Edition)Wendy and LucyThe Hottest StateSynecdoche New YorkShutter Island",5,"I have to sing goofy, in order to sing.

1329033,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B0036TGTDE,Chris Pandolfi,"[5, 8]","""Blue Valentine"" is about as perfect a film as any you're likely to see. Even with the recent release of the brilliant ""Rabbit Hole,"" it's been ages since I've seen a story so resonant with characters so real. Many wonderful films have taken life issues and heightened them for dramatic emphasis; this movie presents itself so authentically that, if it weren't for the casting of Ryan Gosling and Michelle Williams, I might have mistaken it for a work of creative nonfiction. We're often asked to look deeper into characters and find a little bit of ourselves. Here, we not only see ourselves, but also just about everyone we know or have known. This is a human story - so simple and yet so complex, full of drama and humor, mindful of the situation yet vague with the answers. It taps into our emotions and somehow finds the right one to play off of, no matter what our circumstances in life.Gosling and Williams play Dean and Cindy. The film shifts back and forth through time, showing two distinct phases in their relationship. In the beginning, Cindy was in college studying medicine and Dean was an employee for a moving van company. They didn't have much in common, except that they were in love. They're now married, and although they're raising an adorable daughter, Frankie (Faith Wladyka), that spark is no longer there. Cindy is a full time nurse and hardly ever home. Dean misses his wife to the point that he drinks a bit more than he should. They snap at each other when it seems as if nothing is wrong. Neither of them are bad people; it's just that, somewhere along the way, they've lost the ability to communicate with one another. Dean tries to rekindle the flame by taking Cindy to a motel and having a night to themselves. It doesn't go as planned.What went wrong? It would be far too easy to place the blame on an emotional catastrophe, like an affair or a death. Maybe they're just incompatible. Cindy's goal is to become a doctor, which is to say she wants to make something of herself. To make something of yourself is by definition a change, and change is a sign that you're not happy with the way things are. If you watched as your mother had all the motivation and contentment bullied out of her by your father, would you be happy? Cindy was close with her grandmother (Jen Jones), who told her that, in spite of her marriage to her grandfather, she never really fell in love. So Cindy has two generations worth of evidence to support the belief that the word ""commitment"" is code for settling for something less.Compare this to Dean. He lives authentically. He never graduated high school because it just wasn't for him. When he was younger, he was certain he'd never want a wife or a child; now that he's older, he realizes that he always wanted both. For him, work is not about building a career but about providing for himself and his family, and he's content to take whatever odd jobs he can get. In essence, he likes himself the way he is. I suspect Cindy was more attracted to an ideal rather than a person. In those early days, it was fun dating a man with no prospects. Now that they're married, now that it's obvious that Dean has no ambition to be anyone other than himself, she sees only the wasted potential. What about his music? What about his singing? It makes no sense to her that he can enjoy those things yet not use them as a way to become something greater.Inevitably, it comes down the child. By wanting a divorce, Dean claims that Cindy isn't thinking of what's best for their daughter. He argues (perhaps correctly) that Frankie shouldn't have to grow up in a broken home, as he did. Cindy argues (perhaps correctly) that Frankie shouldn't have to grow up listening to her parents fight, as she did. I will not use this review as a platform for my views on parental rights or child advocacy. All that matters is that the issue is presented realistically, and that there are no easy answers.A subplot involving an ex-boyfriend (Mike Vogel) might seem downplayed but is in fact as intelligently written as the rest of the film is. In another life - in another movie - he would be the kind of guy that sits on the witness stand with his head down, sobbing to the jury about loving her too much. Thank God this movie doesn't go for anything that contrived. It's a clich&eacute; to say that a film is a slice of life, but in this case, that's the best description there is. ""Blue Valentine"" has no agenda; what we personally bring to the movie determines how we view the characters, which is to say we're not forced to come to conclusions about how we feel about them. They are who they are. This is the kind of movie that may not have stunts or special effects but can still grab you and not let go. You should see it. Then you should ask your family to see it. Then you should ask your friends to see it, but only on the condition that they ask their families to see it.",5,What Happened to Us?,1293580800,"12 29, 2010",2010,4918,"['Blue', 'Valentine', 'about', 'perfect', 'film', ""'re"", 'likely', 'see', 'Even', 'recent', 'release', 'brilliant', 'Rabbit', 'Hole', 'been', 'ages', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'story', 'so', 'resonant', 'characters', 'so', 'real', 'Many', 'wonderful', 'films', 'have', 'taken', 'life', 'issues', 'heightened', 'dramatic', 'emphasis', 'movie', 'so', 'authentically', 'were', ""n't"", 'casting', 'Ryan', 'Gosling', 'Michelle', 'Williams', 'might', 'have', 'mistaken', 'work', 'creative', 'nonfiction', ""'re"", 'often', 'asked', 'look', 'deeper', 'characters', 'find', 'little', 'bit', 'ourselves', 'Here', 'not', 'only', 'see', 'also', 'just', 'everyone', 'know', 'have', 'known', 'human', 'story', 'so', 'simple', 'yet', 'so', 'complex', 'full', 'drama', 'humor', 'mindful', 'situation', 'yet', 'vague', 'answers', 'emotions', 'somehow', 'right', 'one', 'play', 'off', 'matter', 'what', 'circumstances', 'life.Gosling', 'Williams', 'play', 'Dean', 'Cindy', 'film', 'shifts', 'back', 'forth', 'time', 'showing', 'two', 'distinct', 'phases', 'relationship', 'beginning', 'Cindy', 'was', 'college', 'studying', 'medicine', 'Dean', 'was', 'employee', 'moving', 'van', 'company', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'common', 'were', 'love', ""'re"", 'now', 'married', ""'re"", 'raising', 'adorable', 'daughter', 'Frankie', 'Faith', 'Wladyka', 'spark', 'no', 'longer', 'there', 'Cindy', 'full', 'time', 'nurse', 'hardly', 'ever', 'home', 'Dean', 'wife', 'point', 'bit', 'more', 'should', 'snap', 'other', 'when', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'are', 'bad', 'people', 'just', 'somewhere', 'way', ""'ve"", 'lost', 'ability', 'communicate', 'one', 'Dean', 'rekindle', 'flame', 'taking', 'Cindy', 'motel', 'having', 'night', ""n't"", 'go', 'planned.What', 'went', 'wrong', 'would', 'be', 'far', 'too', 'easy', 'place', 'blame', 'emotional', 'catastrophe', 'affair', 'death', 'Maybe', ""'re"", 'just', 'incompatible', 'Cindy', 'goal', 'become', 'doctor', 'say', 'make', 'something', 'herself', 'make', 'something', 'definition', 'change', 'change', 'sign', ""'re"", 'not', 'happy', 'way', 'things', 'are', 'watched', 'mother', 'had', 'motivation', 'contentment', 'bullied', 'father', 'would', 'be', 'happy', 'Cindy', 'was', 'close', 'grandmother', 'Jen', 'Jones', 'who', 'told', 'spite', 'marriage', 'grandfather', 'never', 'really', 'fell', 'love', 'So', 'Cindy', 'two', 'generations', 'evidence', 'support', 'belief', 'word', 'commitment', 'code', 'settling', 'something', 'less.Compare', 'Dean', 'authentically', 'never', 'graduated', 'high', 'school', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'When', 'was', 'younger', 'was', 'certain', ""'d"", 'never', 'want', 'wife', 'child', 'now', 'older', 'always', 'wanted', 'work', 'not', 'building', 'career', 'providing', 'family', 'content', 'take', 'odd', 'jobs', 'can', 'get', 'essence', 'way', 'suspect', 'Cindy', 'was', 'more', 'attracted', 'ideal', 'rather', 'person', 'early', 'days', 'was', 'fun', 'dating', 'man', 'prospects', 'Now', ""'re"", 'married', 'now', 'obvious', 'Dean', 'ambition', 'be', 'anyone', 'other', 'only', 'wasted', 'potential', 'What', 'music', 'What', 'singing', 'sense', 'can', 'enjoy', 'things', 'yet', 'not', 'use', 'way', 'become', 'something', 'greater.Inevitably', 'down', 'child', 'wanting', 'divorce', 'Dean', 'Cindy', ""n't"", 'thinking', 'what', 'best', 'daughter', 'perhaps', 'correctly', 'Frankie', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'grow', 'up', 'broken', 'home', 'did', 'Cindy', 'perhaps', 'correctly', 'Frankie', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'grow', 'up', 'listening', 'parents', 'fight', 'did', 'will', 'not', 'use', 'review', 'platform', 'views', 'parental', 'rights', 'child', 'advocacy', 'matters', 'issue', 'presented', 'realistically', 'are', 'easy', 'answers.A', 'subplot', 'involving', 'ex-boyfriend', 'Mike', 'Vogel', 'might', 'seem', 'downplayed', 'fact', 'intelligently', 'written', 'rest', 'film', 'life', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'kind', 'guy', 'witness', 'stand', 'head', 'down', 'sobbing', 'jury', 'loving', 'too', 'much', 'Thank', 'God', 'movie', ""n't"", 'go', 'anything', 'contrived', 'clich', 'eacute', 'say', 'film', 'slice', 'life', 'case', 'best', 'description', 'Blue', 'Valentine', 'agenda', 'what', 'personally', 'bring', 'movie', 'how', 'view', 'characters', 'say', ""'re"", 'not', 'forced', 'come', 'conclusions', 'how', 'feel', 'are', 'who', 'are', 'kind', 'movie', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'stunts', 'special', 'effects', 'can', 'still', 'grab', 'not', 'let', 'go', 'should', 'see', 'Then', 'should', 'ask', 'family', 'see', 'Then', 'should', 'ask', 'friends', 'see', 'only', 'condition', 'ask', 'families', 'see']",N/A

I don't need movies to have happy endings or to have everything wrapped up in a neat little bow by the end for me to like it, but this wasn't even enjoyable to watch, despite the strong performances by the actors.Dean and Cindy don't have much chemistry together, even in the beginning of their relationship. The scene of Cindy dancing around while Dean sings and plays the ukulele was cute in the trailer, but in the context of the film it's strangely off-putting, as are all the other early scenes of the two of them together.

1329036,AZZHSA4KMGXG7,B0036TGTDE,chubbagrubb,"[0, 0]","Blue Valentine chronicles the relationship between Dean (Ryan Gosling) and Cindy (Michelle Williams) and portrays the all-too-realistic pain and anger that can come hand in hand with falling in love. Cindy is a quirky blonde who had fallen for the typical high-school jock character before Dean turned up with his ukulele, serenading her with the apt song 'You always hurt the ones you love'. The film switches between these early scenes of passionate attraction to the bleak final days of their relationship: stuck in a dead end job, Dean drinks and struggles with his anger as Cindy tries to balance her job, her daughter and her relationship.Gosling and Williams act the parts faultlessly and I was completely captivated by the characters as they fell in love with each other, and cried with them as it all fell apart. It is a deeply painful and endearing love story and it is almost relentlessly grim, so anyone hoping for a happy ending will probably want to give this one a miss. My only criticism would be that the story jumps from the captivating scenes of the couple falling in love to the brutal breakdown of their marriage without sufficiently showing how it got to that state. As a result, sympathy tends to fall with the loveable but slightly useless character of Dean, as he is neglected and snapped at by Cindy and yet the film seems to want to give the impression that each are mutually hurt and responsible for the failure of the relationship.",5,Depressing but beautifully acted,1359244800,"01 27, 2013",2013,1460,"['Blue', 'Valentine', 'relationship', 'Dean', 'Ryan', 'Gosling', 'Cindy', 'Michelle', 'Williams', 'all-too-realistic', 'pain', 'anger', 'can', 'come', 'hand', 'hand', 'falling', 'love', 'Cindy', 'quirky', 'blonde', 'who', 'had', 'fallen', 'typical', 'high-school', 'jock', 'character', 'Dean', 'turned', 'up', 'ukulele', 'serenading', 'apt', 'song', 'always', 'hurt', 'ones', 'love', 'film', 'switches', 'early', 'scenes', 'passionate', 'attraction', 'bleak', 'final', 'days', 'relationship', 'stuck', 'dead', 'end', 'job', 'Dean', 'drinks', 'struggles', 'anger', 'Cindy', 'balance', 'job', 'daughter', 'relationship.Gosling', 'Williams', 'act', 'parts', 'faultlessly', 'was', 'completely', 'captivated', 'characters', 'fell', 'love', 'other', 'cried', 'fell', 'apart', 'deeply', 'painful', 'endearing', 'love', 'story', 'almost', 'relentlessly', 'grim', 'anyone', 'hoping', 'happy', 'ending', 'will', 'probably', 'want', 'give', 'one', 'miss', 'only', 'criticism', 'would', 'be', 'story', 'jumps', 'captivating', 'scenes', 'couple', 'falling', 'love', 'brutal', 'breakdown', 'marriage', 'sufficiently', 'showing', 'how', 'got', 'state', 'result', 'sympathy', 'tends', 'fall', 'loveable', 'slightly', 'useless', 'character', 'Dean', 'neglected', 'snapped', 'Cindy', 'yet', 'film', 'want', 'give', 'impression', 'are', 'mutually', 'hurt', 'responsible', 'failure', 'relationship']",N/A
1329037,A3DD96LN8U1NM,B0036TGTDE,citygal,"[1, 8]","SPOILERSThis movie is so indicative of our times. Our ""heroine"" is a girl who started having sex at 13 and admittedly had 20+ partners by the time she's 20.  The romance is based completely on emotion with no logic involved (e.g., mutual interests, etc.).  It's no surprise then that, ultimately, Cindy wants a divorce because she has ""fallen out of love"" with Dean.  Ever heard of committment? Sex, ""relationships,"" and divorce today all center completely around whether one is ""happy"" or not or the emotion du jour.  No one ever wants to work through anything or go through any discomfort. It's just easier to ditch that and move on to something that feels good.  I don't think this is the intended message of the movie, but it's what I got out of it. It's a sad, realistic commentary on ""love"" and marriage in our society.So, the movie is well-made and well-acted, but I can't say that I would recommend it unless you can take a concentrated dose of pure reality.

1329038,A3SFO2GSP5CVSM,B0036TGTDE,"Cosmoetica ""cosmoeticadotcom""","[0, 0]","Blue Valentine is a film designed to stir debate, but not in the usual silly political nor emotional sort of way. Its debate is of a deeper and more profound measure, and that is it asks which of the two main characters profiled in the film is in the wrong? The film does its best to be evenhanded, and for every tick of the ledger against one of the major characters, an equally incisive demerit can be handed out to the other. However, the biggest demerit I can give regarding this 2010 film, directed by Derek Cianfrance, about the turmoil of a mediocre marriage, is the critical cribbing that abounds in essays and reviews of the film, online and off. And that cribbing involves the almost near-universal claim that this film follows the end of, or the dissolution of, that marriage. Yet, nothing of the sort can be convincingly construed from the film's contents nor its ending.Yes, the film, which bifurcates into flashbacks of how the married couple of Dean and Cindy Pereira met, and details a troubling two days, some years later, around the 4th of July, does have Cindy declare that she wants a divorce, but that occurs 15-20 minutes before the film ends, with Dean walking away, down a street, after some reconciliation has occurred. Also, given the volume of detail that we get on this couple's relationship, from the things actually shown in the two time frames, to those things easily inferred from those seen things, and the character portrayals of the two lead actors, Ryan Gosling and Michelle Williams, it's pretty obvious that, like most couples in this sort of relationship between two weak willed individuals, this run of troubling days is simply the latest incarnation of personal melodrama the two have jointly constructed, in fact, enhancing their bond, long term, due to its joint effort. And the film reinforces this with a few telling moments in the film wherein we see Cindy's parents' marriage, and hear of the marriage of her grandmother- two women Cindy clearly resembles; especially as she seeks Dean to be violent toward her, only to belittle him as `not a man' because he refuses her invitations to be brutish. In short, this is not a film about the end of a marriage, but a film about 99+% of all marriages that last till death do us part.",3,Good,1340236800,"06 21, 2012",2012,2274,"['Blue', 'Valentine', 'film', 'designed', 'stir', 'debate', 'not', 'usual', 'silly', 'political', 'emotional', 'sort', 'way', 'debate', 'deeper', 'more', 'profound', 'measure', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'profiled', 'film', 'wrong', 'film', 'best', 'be', 'evenhanded', 'tick', 'ledger', 'one', 'major', 'characters', 'equally', 'incisive', 'demerit', 'can', 'be', 'handed', 'out', 'other', 'However', 'biggest', 'demerit', 'can', 'give', 'regarding', '2010', 'film', 'directed', 'Derek', 'Cianfrance', 'turmoil', 'mediocre', 'marriage', 'critical', 'cribbing', 'essays', 'reviews', 'film', 'online', 'off', 'cribbing', 'almost', 'near-universal', 'claim', 'film', 'end', 'dissolution', 'marriage', 'nothing', 'sort', 'can', 'be', 'convincingly', 'construed', 'film', 'contents', 'ending.Yes', 'film', 'flashbacks', 'how', 'married', 'couple', 'Dean', 'Cindy', 'Pereira', 'met', 'details', 'troubling', 'two', 'days', 'years', 'later', '4th', 'July', 'have', 'Cindy', 'declare', 'divorce', '15-20', 'minutes', 'film', 'Dean', 'walking', 'away', 'down', 'street', 'reconciliation', 'occurred', 'Also', 'given', 'volume', 'detail', 'get', 'couple', 'relationship', 'things', 'actually', 'shown', 'two', 'time', 'frames', 'things', 'easily', 'inferred', 'seen', 'things', 'character', 'portrayals', 'two', 'lead', 'actors', 'Ryan', 'Gosling', 'Michelle', 'Williams', 'pretty', 'obvious', 'most', 'couples', 'sort', 'relationship', 'two', 'weak', 'willed', 'individuals', 'run', 'troubling', 'days', 'simply', 'latest', 'incarnation', 'personal', 'melodrama', 'two', 'have', 'jointly', 'constructed', 'fact', 'enhancing', 'bond', 'long', 'term', 'due', 'joint', 'effort', 'film', 'few', 'telling', 'moments', 'film', 'wherein', 'see', 'Cindy', 'parents', 'marriage', 'hear', 'marriage', 'grandmother-', 'two', 'women', 'Cindy', 'clearly', 'especially', 'Dean', 'be', 'violent', 'only', 'belittle', 'not', 'man', 'invitations', 'be', 'brutish', 'short', 'not', 'film', 'end', 'marriage', 'film', '99+', '%', 'marriages', 'last', 'till', 'death', 'do', 'part']",N/A
1329039,A169TLPFU3XZZF,B0036TGTDE,Crabby McGrouchpants,"[0, 6]","""There really IS something silent and dull about losing youth: youth really IS, as Deirdre says, a sad evocative perfume of many stray smells.""(from Douglas Coupland's debut novel,Generation X: Tales for an Accelerated Culture[1991])-----------------------------------------------------------------------------RATING GUIDE:***** -- Provides a yardstick by which later artworks & life experiences can be measured.**** --  F****n' awesome!***  --  Okay.**  --  Lame.*  --  Sucks.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------STANLEY KUBRICK ONCE famously described Jim Thompson's novel ""The Killer Inside Me"" [1952] as ""the most believable first-person story of a criminally of a criminally warped mind I have ever encountered,"" a statement that is as typically Kubrickian in its authority & enthusiasm as it is in its careful use of qualifiers: ""most believable"" and ""[that] I have ever encountered.""IOW:  It's notoriously difficult to get inside someone else's head, using the only tools that are ultimately at your disposal (empathy, attentiveness, not missing the ""forest for the trees,"" etc.), and Thompson's novel is the most plausible (or, alternately, the least implausible) first-person depiction of a person is constantly straining against itself to make sense of reality.The term for this, of course, is ""psychosis"": a locking of the ""defense mechanisms"" any healthy person with a normally-functioning psyche needs & utilizes for ""self""-preservation of one kind or another.  The fact that what's ""normal"" for another has nothing to do with whether a person is psychotic or not -- and, in fact, is what makes psychosis so notoriously difficult to spot until something of consequence for other people happens, and it's ""too late"" (as Kubrick himself explains with a breathtakingly-offhand matter-of-factness in a 1968 Playboy interview, in a brief discussion of the Gen. Jack D. Ripper character in ""Dr. Strangelove"").On top of that, there is never any need or guarantee that a psychotic person will develop the markedly-outsized drives & desires serial killers like Ted Bundy, Ed Gein, or Jeffrey Dahmer do -- the ""itch,"" as the murdered girl in Peter Jackson's ""The Lovely Bones"" [2009] accurately puts it.  Part of what makes serial killers so difficult to spot even after they get started on their killing spree - and part of what makes them ""intriguing"" to contemporary American culture, on the basis of their ""inexplicableness"" -- is the fact that scant few people walking, save experienced psychologists, have much awareness of what ""simple"" or ""everyday"" psychosis is, or that the chances are virtually nil that a none-too-small percentage of the people they know and interact with on a daily basis are not ""functionally"" psychotic: in other words, in a sort of ""psyche-lock"" that enables the person to get from point A to point B and back again but basically restricts any decision-making to those choices available within the parameters of that ""tunnel vision"" for the rest of that lifetime.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------""My friends are either married, boring, and depressed; single, bored, and depressed; or moved out of town to avoid boredom and depression.  And some of them bought houses, which has to be the kiss of death, personality-wise.  When someone tells you they bought a house, they might as well tell you they no longer have a personality.  You can immediately assume so many things: that they're locked into jobs they hate; that they're broke; that they spend every night watching videos; that they're fifteen pounds overweight; that they no longer listen to new ideas.  It's profoundly depressing.""(from ""Generation X"")----------------------------------------------------------------------------------Blue Valentine employs a flash-back-and-forth-as-is-relevant structure, like the ""Astral Review"" portion of Gaspar No's recent ""Enter the Void"" and Sidney Lumet's scathing critique of the fallout of ""Family Values""-types' unvented hostilities, ""Before the Devil Knows You're Dead"" [2008].  [NOTE ON THE LATTER: It may take the viewer some time after viewing the film to trace back the various narrative strands to their true ""nodal points"" of origin -- as it did me -- but, apparently, when all is said and done, the only two acts of cold-blooded, deliberate murder are committed by the two nice-nicey ""old folks.""  Zowee!  Aye carumba!]Anyway . . . where was I?""Blue Valentine.""Right.At this point in our culture -- using these three films as ""evidence"" -- it would appear that this narrative structure is less simply an artistic conceit (albeit an innovative and engaging one) than a necessary method to confront truths too damaging to the psyche to confront ""head on.""No-one would really want to go see (or, for that matter, make) a film in which the husband was obviously & ostentatiously a stubborn, unambitious, one-note ""loverboy"" who notices that the object of his attraction is ""pretty"" and simply refuses to budge from her direct line of vision, which he thereupon commences to occupy and unwaveringly fail to leave..  Such a film would not only be cruel, it would also be boring, and, as Anthony Burgess once said (of the abridged version of his novel ""A Clockwork Orange""), thus present ""an unfair picture of human life.""Blue Valentine shrugs off this nonrealistic approach to present us -- via flash-back-and-forth -- a more accurate picture of the -- I have to say it -- psychotic suitor's adapting to situation after situation as they unfold, so we are presented with a ""sum total"" vision of how these things could play out in everyday life.  The fictional couple we follow around are only able to ""make calls"" on the situations as they happen, on the basis of what they could reasonably and evidencibly expect to know & be able to ""take in"" at the time.  As such, it offers a devastating critique of the modern-day state of ""marriage"" revealed to be, yet still, a self-justifying end unto itself, which ""justifies"" all other concerns -- without making the female protagonist seem like an utterly manipulable & malleable moron.  [SPOILER ALERT:  She triumphs, at the end!]----------------------------------------------------------------------------------""But then I have another powerful revelation -- one that perhaps every male in every species has in his life, and one that might very well mark the passage from boy-- to manhood.  I realize that at this moment, ejaculating takes precedence over absolutely everything else in the world, including the death of innocent people.""(from Mark Leyner's comic novel,The Tetherballs of Bougainville: A Novel[1997])----------------------------------------------------------------------------------The ""husband"" in the film (I forget his name -- I've only seen the film once; please bear with me!), as played by Ryan Gosling, truly has ""nothing better to do  /  than pay too much attention to you"" [1].  He catches a stray glance at his (later) ""wife"" as she -- nervous about being caught, for letting her grandmother smoke out the window of her nursing-home room like a teenager -- attempts to close the door.  He misinterprets her fear -- gets his ""foot in the door,"" &agrave; la the old prototype of the pushy door-to-door traveling salesman -- and nothing but misinterpretation after misinterpretation accrues from there.As played by Michelle Williams -- both suitably ""cast"" in the role and, thus, truly ""embodying"" the part -- the female protagonist is, indisputably, what the fellers like to call ""hot.""  Her suitor notices this.  He's got nothing better to do.That's it.That's what starts this ""love affair,"" what commences a continual backwards ""back-pedaling"" on the part of the boy-o to keep the object of his affections clearly in view.  (Or, rather, he clearly in hers.)  Any rebuke is ""cute.""  Any rebuff causes for a further ""gosh awshucks, won't you even give a guy a chance?"" volley -- all staying safely this side of decorum and propriety.  (IOW:  He's never what you might call rude or vulgar, but, in this case, this is more a failure to take risks than a continually-maintained sense of decency.  He still can't quite resist making the occasional ""ribald"" comment -- ""I'd sure like it if she were my doctor"" he jokes, unshaven, at the dinner table with her mother and father, following up immediately with a careful: ""I mean . . . she's a nice person!  She'd make a . . . good doctor!"")----------------------------------------------------------------------------------""PRETEND TO GO TO THE BATHROOM AND NEVER COME BACK IF: [#3] He brings you flowers on the second or third date.  I know that sounds awfully harsh, but think about it: What do flowers really mean?  Probably that he's completely tuned our your bizarre sense of style or your obsession with bats or your talent for playing Hungarian fiddle music or whatever.  Flowers mean that he's just taking shots in the dark in hopes that he may get laid.""(fromPagan Kennedy's Living: A Handbook for Maturing Hipsters[1997])----------------------------------------------------------------------------------Flowers, serenades, any trope he can think of to throw at her: this is what counts as ""courtship.""  Mission accomplished, purpose served.""What sort of DREAM WORLD are you LIVING in?"" the house-painter husband asks his R.N. wife, who's so esteemed by her boss for her work that she's been asked to temporarily & tentatively relocate out-of-town, to assist with his providing medical services there.  ""What . . . WHAT could I do?""""I don't know,"" she responds, chastened ... at a loss, but resolute.  ""What about music?"" she offers to the man across the table from her -- the six-or-seven-years-her-senior father of her child -- in reference to the song he once sung for her (w/ukulele accompaniment) towards the ends of his getting her into bed, a practice he has, since, abandoned.  ""You could--""""My life is as a HUSBAND and FATHER,"" the (doubtless) less-well-paid member of the marriage tells her.  ""That's my life,"" he says, as though this were an end unto itself --  like being a ""cousin"" or an ""aunt.""(Oh . . . did I mention?  This ""dialogue"" takes place in one of those tacky ""love motels,"" in a room he booked as an effort to ""patch things up.""  Good job, Romeo!  Subtle ... classy ... AND non-patronizing!)----------------------------------------------------------------------------------""If only I had left psycho princess on her own, she'd be pouring all her female mania into a conceptual sculpture.  Dogs can be babies, cats can babies.  You don't actually have to have one ... But to bring a baby into this world is to start part two of your two-part life.""(from RISD graduate Rachel B. Glaser's short story,Pee on Water[2009])----------------------------------------------------------------------------------The kid they have together is cute.  (Kids usually ARE!)  LESS cute it the ""grown adult"" father, getting it on with the hot, young R.N. (did I mention the disproportion in their incomes?  oh . . . I did?  Sorry!) crying like an emotionally ill-equipped ten-year-old when he learns the family dog has died; getting said daughter to play ""kid games"" such as spilling her milk & cereal all over the table-top so they can suck them off the table surface (""like LEOPARDS!""); and accusingly shooting the old-standard, incredulously-spoken ""You ran into an old boyfriend at the supermarket . . . and you're telling me about it just NOW?"" line at his wife, after she, apparently, fails to mention this FIRST THING after turning the key in the ignition, checking the roadway, and pulling into traffic.  (Yes, ladies & gents, this ""wounded male pride"" routine gets trotted out after she tells him on the ACTUAL CAR RIDE home from the supermarket/incident in question . . . You see, that's the thing with being constantly ""on the defensive.""  It is, truly, in and of itself, a FULL-TIME JOB!  (Y'know -- again -- like being .. a ""husband"" or ... a ""father""?  Painting houses . . . shucks, that's just a SIDELINE!  ""What kind of DREAM WORLD are YOU living in,"" etc.))Oops.  You'll have to excuse me.I DO believe I lost my ""composure,"" there.Now . . . WHERE were we, again?----------------------------------------------------------------------------------""It is no secret nowadays, particularly to women, that many American males, even those of middle-age appearance, wearing suits and holding down jobs, are in fact, incredible as it seems, still small boys inside.  Flange is this type of character, although when I wrote this story, I thought he was pretty cool.  He wants children -- why isn't made clear -- but not at the price of developing any real life shared with an adult woman.""(Thomas Pynchon, in ""Introduction"" (fromSlow Learner: Early Stories[1984]))----------------------------------------------------------------------------------Among the cornucopia of details which are wholly omitted and entirely disregarded in most (male) critics' reviews of this film -- typifying it as a ""tragic, failed love story,"" in which there are ""no good or bad guys"" (and, certainly, NO-ONE at fault . . . certainly not the the male with the ""hot"" wife!) -- we learn THIS from wifey's preliminary interview for having an abortion: ""How old were you when you had your first sexual experience?""  ""13.""  ""That's not unusual,"" the nurse responds straight away, with a practiced, reassuring tone that serves to confirm the CONTENT of her carefully-chosen words.Nowhere else in evidence in (again, the mostly MALE) reviewers' rush to praise this film as a ""one that got away"" tragedy is the future bride's response to the ""How many sexual partners have you had in your life?"" question.  ""Twenty . . . maybe twenty-five,"" she responds, with unfeigned uncertainty.Ditto the scene giving us a glimpse of the med. school student's ""home life"": ""You call this DINNER?"" her father rails at her mother, semi-arbitrarily and certainly at full-volume -- giving us an unambivalent picture of an emotional tyrant holding his wife and daughter in his emotional thrall.  (Of course, one would have to have even a glancing familiarity with such standard scenes -- first-hand, second-hand, or, heaven forbid, though encountering them in memoirs or other ""fictionalized"" sources -- in order to correctly ""assess"" it as such.  Maybe it's a lack of such experience that makes such a telling scene go ""in one ear and out the other"" of said reviewers, who (inadvertently) do the film a real disservice by not accounting for as wide a picture of the ""playing field"" of these people's lives it actually does, in fact, give the view.  But, then again, maybe they were just staring, awestruck, at Michelle Williams's visage.)----------------------------------------------------------------------------------""Tony Harod was trying.  Some time in the past fifteen minutes their passion had descended through mere friction to real work.  Kari knew all of the right moves, she performed as well as any porno starlet that Harod had ever directed.  She was a perfect fantasy, anticipating his every wish, giving pure pleasure with every touch, centering the entire act around the self-centered penis worship she had learned long ago resided in every male.  She was perfect.  Harod thought he might as well have been s******g a knothole for all the involvement and excitement he felt.""(from Dan Simmons's horror novelCarrion Comfort[1989])----------------------------------------------------------------------------------Ariel Levy, in her fascinating and troubling book, ""Female Chauvinist Pigs: Women and the Rise of Raunch Culture,"" limns the modern variant of ""feminism"" as being, basically: ""It's such a foregone conclusion we don't have to worry about being feminist.""  [NOT an actual quote, BTW!]  IOW: since all modern male hipsters -- and dirty old men, and certain disproportionally aggressive ""athletes"" -- are already ""feminist""-ized by now, well, what not roll in the mud a little?  After all . . . everyone else is doing it!  (Or, more to the point: there's NO PLACE ELSE TO GO!)The lack of a tenable counter-culture -- one that is definitely still there, mind you, bubbling along at the margins of mainstream United States culture, whether most folks ""know"" about it or not -- not only accounts for the limited choices the erstwhile couple in this film face, but, additionally, the film itself's canonization as a ""heartbreaking love story"" -- as much of an outright misread, in the direct interests of praising it, that this contemporary film culture has seen since George Lucas's ""American Graffiti"" [1973] was taken as permission to wallow in 50's nostalgia, rather than the canny bit of time-travel and re-acknowledgment of buried & sidelined social issues that it, in fact, truly is.THE SUM TOTAL EFFECT OF ALL THIS BEING: We, apparently, are now living in an age (to judge from a ""conversation"" I recently ""overhead"") where female acquaintances can be treated the following ""insightful"" comments on a well-known indie-film auteur's latest effort: ""It's hard to believe that a movie with lesbo scene between Natalie Portman and Mila Kunis could be that bad"" and ""Not a good movie but . . . that lesbo scene!  It was great to see it with my girlfriend!""  [SAY IT WITH ME: ""Eww!  T.M.I., dude . . . T.M.I.!""]THE POINT BEING: Why on earth are people showing up at thought-provoking, non-""hackwork,"" ""written"" and ""directed"" films (rather than simply ""produced"" one) to satisfy these, um, ""needs""?The answer, I fear, isn't going to make me very many friends (and, in fact, may very well LOSE me a few!).----------------------------------------------------------------------------------""Andy, Dag, and Claire are underemployed, overeducated, intensely private, and unpredictable.  Like the group they mirror, they have nowhere to direct their anger, no-one to assuage their fears, and no culture to replace their anomie.""  (from the inside cover of ""Generation X"")----------------------------------------------------------------------------------Quentin Tarantino, the film ""Reality Bites"" [1993], and the (continued) presence of ""The Baffler"" have probably done more to squander and misdirect any possible energies that could be directed towards building a tenable American counter-culture than could even be measured, as of this writing.  From THIS vantage point, ten years past onset of the millennium, one can look back and see what was going on, back in the early 90's: not just another generations coming of age (no small thing, unless we as a culture want to overtly become one of denial & displaced energies), not just the the throwing off the shackles of the Boomers' entitlement those of us growing up in the 80's had to deal with (""You weren't there . . . you kids today, you don't do nothin'!  WE protested, stuck flowers in the guns of soldiers, listened to John Lennon, smoked lots of pot, listened to Timothy Leary, took lots of unsupervised acid trips, listened to the Grateful Dead . . . still listen to the Grateful Dead . . . HERE: listen to the Grateful Dead!""), but potentially becoming the very first generation since the luxury of ""teenagerdom"" and a lifespan beyond 35-40 years was granted to the remaining 87%-or-so of the population by the ruling classes to figure out that this was, in fact the case and had been true all along (since the times of the Roman Republic, say).SO, OBVIOUSLY:  Now, everyone's ""smart,"" everyone's ""hip"" (also while conveniently discounting that there is or could be such a thing, and dismissing the whole time-consuming and hardly-guaranteed process of finding your way around by ascribing it oneself as a foregone conclusion and, thus, uncontested cultural birthright), everybody's crammed in together (culturally, as much as physically), no-one can get a bead on the tragedies which those in power in our government have been causing without having to resort to (at least a degree of) ineffectual ""white liberal guilt,"" countless hostilities and unacknowledged grudges filter down to us at ""ground level"" without hardly more than a few of us being aware that this is the case or knowing what to do about it or who to consult to get even a partial, working view of ""the playing"" field ... and so on!----------------------------------------------------------------------------------""The guys I'd meet at working as a call girl treated me so much better than the guys I'd meet at bars.

So they have ended up with the protections of neither the patriarchy nor those old-school, man-hating radical feminists.""(from Caitlin Flanagan's article ""The Hazards of Duke: A Now-Infamous PowerPoint Presentation Exposes a Lot about Men, Women, Sex, and Alcohol -- and about How Universities Are Letting Their Female Students Down"" in the Jan./Feb. 2011 issue of ""The Atlantic"")----------------------------------------------------------------------------------""Not doin' it,"" he says.  ""Well . . . what then?"" she asks in response.  ""I'm just not going to,"" he responds, cute, winning, and confident.  ""Don't do it -- it's a bum trip.  It's overrated,"" he rambles on (or some such nonsense; I honestly can't remember this part of the dialogue very well at all).They're talking about DYING, of course: one of the elderly residents boy-o charm-o had helped move in as part of his moving job had not turned up when he returned in an effort to be ""nice.""  The elder's absence was taken by the heavy-lifter neither as inexplicable nor distressing: he just chose to ""disregard"" it.Well . . . after 20 or 25 of these ""charmers"" (the fellow she meets in the supermarket isn't any prize either -- nor is he subtle or ambivalent about ""taking another shot""), I guess she, finally, was able to gain enough momentum behind her to push THIS one off her,

1329042,AEQFYOI6YJ83Z,B0036TGTDE,DanD,"[0, 1]","Derek Cianfrance's BLUE VALENTINE is a disturbing look at emotional decay.  It chronicles the relationship of two young lovers, Dean and Cindy, who marry and have a child.  The film goes back and forth in time, beautifully painting a full portrait of this passionate, troubled relationship, which ultimately descends into emotionally violent chaos.As the leads, Ryan Gosling and Michelle Williams shine.  Neither is a true saint here; they are human beings, and this is a human relationship.  The actors have amazing chemistry: the early years are genuinely moving, and the later years are genuinely disturbing.  The script is stellar, the directing is top-notch, the camera work is engaging (you really feel like a part of the movie), but it is the performances of the lead actors that anchor this film in reality.You should be warned: this isn't an easy film to watch.  There's not a whole lot of physical violence (just one scene, and it's not what you may be expecting), and the sexuality is more hinted at than anything (who the hell wanted to give this an NC-17 rating, and why?).  But the emotions, the tension, the hurt these two (un)intentionally inflict on each other...when contrasted against the spontaneous love of their early years, it's powerful.  And that is what makes this such a memorable film.  Portraits of relationships fail all the time, because they become stereotypical or boring.

While it was absolutely heartbreaking to watch these two helplessly fall out of love, it was simply impossible to not feel both of the characters' pain of desperately trying to hold onto what has already, hopelessly expired.You'd think with so many broken hearts in this world, someone would've figured out a scientific, mathematically correct formula to making love last.  Unfortunately, the only thing I can come up with would be that emotions can be dangerous illusions that can carve out the most hardened heart with a vulnerable, bleeding wound that may never heal.  Too bad so many of us become deaf to our head's advice while we are all too easy to melt listening only to our seductive hearts...I love this movie because the spontaneous optimist in me will thoroughly appreciate the innocent charm of their love story.But I respect this movie because the conscientious realist in me will always know that love (or any life changing event for that matter) built without a clear foundation and direction, the structure will always be challenged to collapse.Other than how I feel about this story, the acting was superb and the direction was amazing.I have no choice but to give it 5 perfect stars not just because it was a good movie - but because if you can look deep within, Blue Valentine may just hypnotize your heart as it did mine.",5,"My blue, blue valentine...",1351468800,"10 29, 2012",2012,1639,"['Other', 'savoring', 'charming', 'morsel', 'Ryan', 'Gosling', 'Michelle', 'Williams', 'falling', 'ever', 'so', 'innocently', 'love', 'what', 'respect', 'most', 'movie', 'was', 'being', 'able', 'completely', 'believe', 'how', 'even', 'most', 'sweetest', 'unselfish', 'love', 'can', 'manage', 'deteriorate', 'cruel', 'evolution', 'time', 'was', 'absolutely', 'heartbreaking', 'watch', 'two', 'helplessly', 'fall', 'love', 'was', 'simply', 'impossible', 'not', 'feel', 'characters', 'pain', 'desperately', 'trying', 'hold', 'onto', 'what', 'already', 'hopelessly', 'expired.You', ""'d"", 'think', 'so', 'many', 'broken', 'hearts', 'world', 'someone', 'would', ""'ve"", 'figured', 'out', 'scientific', 'mathematically', 'correct', 'formula', 'making', 'love', 'last', 'Unfortunately', 'only', 'thing', 'can', 'come', 'up', 'would', 'be', 'emotions', 'can', 'be', 'dangerous', 'illusions', 'can', 'carve', 'out', 'most', 'hardened', 'heart', 'vulnerable', 'bleeding', 'may', 'never', 'heal', 'Too', 'bad', 'so', 'many', 'become', 'deaf', 'head', 'advice', 'are', 'too', 'easy', 'melt', 'listening', 'only', 'seductive', 'hearts', 'love', 'movie', 'spontaneous', 'optimist', 'will', 'thoroughly', 'appreciate', 'innocent', 'charm', 'love', 'story.But', 'respect', 'movie', 'conscientious', 'realist', 'will', 'always', 'know', 'love', 'life', 'changing', 'event', 'matter', 'built', 'clear', 'foundation', 'direction', 'structure', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'challenged', 'collapse.Other', 'how', 'feel', 'story', 'acting', 'was', 'superb', 'direction', 'was', 'amazing.I', 'have', 'choice', 'give', '5', 'perfect', 'stars', 'not', 'just', 'was', 'good', 'movie', 'can', 'look', 'deep', 'Blue', 'Valentine', 'may', 'just', 'hypnotize', 'heart', 'did', 'mine']",N/A

This allows the film to explore how the very differences that attract two people to one another initially can become the same differences that eventually make a relationship unbearable.Cindy is a focused, dutiful, practical medical student. Dean is an impulsive, emotional blue collar worker. The flashbacks of the film show how the two meet, and, due to an unplanned pregnancy, quickly decide to marry and start a family. The flashback scenes make it incredibly obvious why these two people would fall in love: Dean offers Cindy spontaneity and romance. Cindy offers Dean stability and purpose.The scenes that take place in the present, 6 years after they meet, make it incredibly obvious why these two people would be unable to sustain a relationship, especially while raising a child. Dean just wants to be a husband and father, and enjoys the freedom of working a blue collar job where he can ""drink a beer at 8 o'clock in the morning."" Cindy takes her nursing career seriously, and makes it clear that she resents having to be the disciplinarian to their daughter, while Dean gets to be the playful, fun dad. Sensing they're on the verge of disaster as a couple, Dean tries to arrange an overnight stay at a cheesy theme hotel. Sadly, his plan backfires, and the couple's relationship finally implodes when Cindy refuses Dean what he needs the most (emotional and sexual intimacy), and Dean, in a drunken rage, threatens what's most important to Cindy (meaningful work and security).The film offers intimacy in a way that few films ever do. Not only are all the facets of the film's central relationship depicted in incredibly intimate detail, even the tangential relationships all maintain a level of intimacy, even if the screen time is limited (Dean's relationship with his daughter; Cindy's relationship with her ailing grandmother; Dean's relationship with an older co-worker; Cindy's relationship with her ex-boyfriend). The film is beautifully directed, written, edited, and shot. And the two leads are outstanding. It's wonderful to see two actors paired together who not only have chemistry but are equally matched in talent, intelligence, and commitment to their roles.",5,Intimacy,1305504000,"05 16, 2011",2011,2365,"['Blue', 'Valentine', 'relationship', 'young', 'couple', 'marriage', 'verge', 'imploding', 'simultaneously', 'flashing', 'back', 'beginning', 'relationship', 'film', 'explore', 'how', 'very', 'attract', 'two', 'people', 'one', 'initially', 'can', 'become', 'same', 'differences', 'eventually', 'make', 'relationship', 'unbearable.Cindy', 'focused', 'dutiful', 'practical', 'medical', 'student', 'Dean', 'impulsive', 'emotional', 'blue', 'collar', 'worker', 'flashbacks', 'film', 'show', 'how', 'two', 'meet', 'due', 'unplanned', 'pregnancy', 'quickly', 'decide', 'marry', 'start', 'family', 'flashback', 'scenes', 'make', 'incredibly', 'obvious', 'why', 'two', 'people', 'would', 'fall', 'love', 'Dean', 'Cindy', 'spontaneity', 'romance', 'Cindy', 'Dean', 'stability', 'purpose.The', 'scenes', 'take', 'place', 'present', '6', 'years', 'meet', 'make', 'incredibly', 'obvious', 'why', 'two', 'people', 'would', 'be', 'unable', 'sustain', 'relationship', 'especially', 'raising', 'child', 'Dean', 'just', 'be', 'husband', 'father', 'freedom', 'working', 'blue', 'collar', 'job', 'where', 'can', 'drink', 'beer', '8', ""o'clock"", 'morning', 'Cindy', 'nursing', 'career', 'seriously', 'clear', 'having', 'be', 'disciplinarian', 'daughter', 'Dean', 'be', 'playful', 'fun', 'dad', 'Sensing', ""'re"", 'verge', 'disaster', 'couple', 'Dean', 'arrange', 'overnight', 'stay', 'cheesy', 'theme', 'hotel', 'Sadly', 'plan', 'couple', 'relationship', 'finally', 'when', 'Cindy', 'Dean', 'what', 'most', 'emotional', 'sexual', 'intimacy', 'Dean', 'drunken', 'rage', 'what', 'most', 'important', 'Cindy', 'meaningful', 'work', 'security', '.The', 'film', 'offers', 'intimacy', 'way', 'few', 'films', 'ever', 'do', 'Not', 'only', 'are', 'facets', 'film', 'central', 'relationship', 'depicted', 'incredibly', 'intimate', 'detail', 'even', 'tangential', 'relationships', 'maintain', 'level', 'intimacy', 'even', 'screen', 'time', 'limited', 'Dean', 'relationship', 'daughter', 'Cindy', 'relationship', 'ailing', 'grandmother', 'Dean', 'relationship', 'older', 'co-worker', 'Cindy', 'relationship', 'ex-boyfriend', 'film', 'beautifully', 'directed', 'written', 'edited', 'shot', 'two', 'leads', 'are', 'outstanding', 'wonderful', 'see', 'two', 'actors', 'paired', 'together', 'who', 'not', 'only', 'have', 'chemistry', 'are', 'equally', 'matched', 'talent', 'intelligence', 'commitment', 'roles']",N/A

And, maybe I have also ... because, for all its efforts, Blue Valentine failed to hold my attention.Foremost, I applaud the director for making an emotionally complex film. Too many filmmakers cater to the expectations of the masses (which is why we have a glut of ""relationship"" films that all follow the same formula. Boring.) Likewise, I do appreciate the aesthetics of this piece. A palette of red, white, and blue is an appropriate choice for this thoroughly American story. Similarly, the choice of blue lighting in the Future Room emphasizes the coldness of this rapidly destructing marriage. And, while many film-goers will find the non-linear structure the film to be confusing, it seems a clever choice (for the happier days to be told in reflection). Moreover, I did ""like"" how a simple encounter at the liquor store turns into an ugly car-ride ... I ""like"" how the audience interprets this moment as a wild over-reaction and is later proven so very wrong.Nonetheless, the story itself had some (unintentional) deep flaws in rhythm. In fact, the darkness of the film may not be at the crux of these negative reviews. Plenty of people appreciate even darker films (such as anything by Aronofsky) without a single complaint. In the same vein, smart audiences do not require ""good guys"" and ""bad guys."" They don't need a husband who batters his wife (or a wife who has an affair)to support a divorce. Gray characters have become a welcome ""norm."" So, while it's easy to point to these qualities and say, ""Well, the audience just isn't sophisticated enough to understand this film,"" that's not entirely true. For me, I found the tempo so inconsistent that I had difficulty remaining engaged. Simple as that.With this said, this film has garnered the attention of many fine critics and scholars. There is ""something"" here that definitely appeals to a number of people. Therefore, I vote that you rent this work and decide for yourself. It may be a piece you need to see ...  Gosling holds up a card in the end-credits that reads, ""Is this you?"". If it is, maybe you NEED this film. Maybe it will make you feel less alone. If you do rent this, I highly encourage you to watch the end credits which show snapshots from happier times. It is (for me) the most poignant aspect of the film.",2,"""Maybe I've Just Seen Too Many Movies"" ...",1306627200,"05 29, 2011",2011,2341,"['Maybe', ""'ve"", 'just', 'seen', 'too', 'many', 'movies', 'Dean', 'maybe', 'have', 'also', 'because', 'efforts', 'Blue', 'Valentine', 'failed', 'hold', 'attention.Foremost', 'applaud', 'director', 'making', 'emotionally', 'complex', 'film', 'Too', 'many', 'filmmakers', 'cater', 'expectations', 'masses', 'why', 'have', 'glut', 'relationship', 'films', 'follow', 'same', 'formula', 'Boring', 'Likewise', 'do', 'appreciate', 'aesthetics', 'piece', 'palette', 'red', 'white', 'blue', 'appropriate', 'choice', 'thoroughly', 'American', 'story', 'Similarly', 'choice', 'blue', 'lighting', 'Future', 'Room', 'coldness', 'rapidly', 'destructing', 'marriage', 'many', 'film-goers', 'will', 'find', 'non-linear', 'structure', 'film', 'be', 'confusing', 'clever', 'choice', 'happier', 'days', 'be', 'told', 'reflection', 'Moreover', 'did', 'like', 'how', 'simple', 'encounter', 'liquor', 'store', 'ugly', 'car-ride', 'how', 'audience', 'moment', 'wild', 'over-reaction', 'later', 'proven', 'so', 'very', 'wrong.Nonetheless', 'story', 'had', 'unintentional', 'deep', 'flaws', 'rhythm', 'fact', 'darkness', 'film', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'crux', 'negative', 'reviews', 'Plenty', 'people', 'appreciate', 'even', 'darker', 'films', 'such', 'anything', 'Aronofsky', 'single', 'complaint', 'same', 'vein', 'smart', 'audiences', 'do', 'not', 'require', 'good', 'guys', 'bad', 'guys', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'husband', 'who', 'wife', 'wife', 'who', 'affair', 'support', 'divorce', 'Gray', 'characters', 'have', 'become', 'welcome', 'norm', 'So', 'easy', 'point', 'qualities', 'say', 'Well', 'audience', 'just', ""n't"", 'sophisticated', 'enough', 'understand', 'film', 'not', 'entirely', 'true', 'found', 'tempo', 'so', 'inconsistent', 'had', 'difficulty', 'remaining', 'engaged', 'Simple', 'that.With', 'said', 'film', 'garnered', 'attention', 'many', 'fine', 'critics', 'scholars', 'something', 'here', 'definitely', 'appeals', 'number', 'people', 'Therefore', 'vote', 'rent', 'work', 'decide', 'may', 'be', 'piece', 'need', 'see', 'Gosling', 'up', 'card', 'end-credits', 'maybe', 'NEED', 'film', 'will', 'make', 'feel', 'less', 'alone', 'do', 'rent', 'highly', 'encourage', 'watch', 'end', 'show', 'snapshots', 'happier', 'times', 'most', 'poignant', 'aspect', 'film']",N/A

With a superb soundtrack ('You and Me' by Penny and the Quarters) and two powerful acting performances that are as good as you'll see, this is a movie that should not be missed.  The story line differs from most romance films in that it portrays some of the harsh realities not unlikely to ensue after the credits roll in every other popcorn romance movie.What makes this film unique is that it consistently documents the juxtaposition between the giddy highs of the initial infatuation period versus six years down the road when mundane frustrations set in after the romance has long ago evaporated.  Another interesting aspect is the way in which it portrays the stresses and harsh realities of the 9 to 5 work environment.  Too often in many films it's as if the characters exist completely outside a reality in which 95% of Americans slave away in; Blue Valentine doesn't fail to intelligently tie into the script the trials and tribulations of the every day work world.In an outlandish move the ratings board originally gave Blue Valentine an NC-17, but then in a peculiar twist later gave it a more reasonable R without the director having made a single cut.Hopefully potential audiences won't overlook this outstanding movie since it's a relatively low budget indie film and clearly doesn't have the advertising budget that the giant studios lavish on their mass produced drivel.

Thanks to engrossing performances from Ryan Gosling (The Ides of March) and Michelle Williams (My Week with Marilyn) and an insightful screenplay co-written by Cianfrance, Joey Curtis and Cami Delavigne, the middle passage doesn't feel missing. Instead, the two parts almost evoke an unsettling memory piece where a couple goes through the enthrallment of falling in love and the purgatory of knowing when that love has died a painful death. Granted the film is not easy to watch at times, but it feels bracingly honest in its portrayal of a marriage unraveling from the weight of social class differences that irreparably breach the relationship at the core.The story focuses on a young working-class couple, Dean Pereira and Cindy Heller. At the outset, he's a high school dropout working for a moving company, and she's a pre-med student living with her unhappy parents and caring for her grandmother in Pennsylvania. They have a chance encounter, fall breathlessly in love, and rush into marriage when Cindy finds herself pregnant by her previous boyfriend, a bad-tempered wrestler named Bobby. Dean agrees to raise Cindy's daughter Frankie, as his own, and their familial bond is established. Several years later near the end of their marriage, they are living in rural Pennsylvania. Dean paints houses for a living, while Cindy has become a nurse. Going through the motions of their marriage, they make one last desperate attempt at resurrecting their troubled relationship by going to a ""sex"" motel, but a domestic dispute ensues leading to a morning-after altercation between Dean and the doctor who had called Cindy to come into the clinic to work that morning. When Dean cannot contain his anger and disappointment, their marriage becomes irreparably broken.The shifting back and forth in time between Dean and Cindy's courtship and the dissolution of their predictable marriage provides a prime opportunity for the actors to show the subtle and often visceral ways the characters had changed over the course of six years. While the scenes of their younger selves are filled with romance and welcome humor in the midst of their sometimes overwhelming bleakness, it is painful and moving to watch the motel scenes where the pair loses the last remaining threads holding them together. Gosling and Williams apparently improvised much of their dialogue, especially in the courtship scenes, and they calibrate their performances with a rhythm and texture that makes their perpetually volatile relationship feel real and heartbreaking. With the use of a Super 16mm in the early scenes and a Red One in the later ones, cinematographer Andrij Parekh lends a palpable authenticity to the characters' lower-middle-class lives.

1329054,A14HM0CZKSSG3M,B0036TGTDE,Elke Notlit,"[2, 6]","In some ways BLUE VALENTINE is two films. On the one hand is a naturalistic look at what happens when a relationship breaks down. On the other (told in flashback) it's a sort of quirky romantic comedy that tells the well-worn story of kooky, lost girl finds equally lost guy: together they compliment each other and live happily ever after... except in this case we know they don't.And that's essentially what's wrong with the film. It's a clash of ideas but writer/director Derek Cianfrance can't resolve that clash in any meaningful way.By definition rom-coms are a type of wish fulfilment fantasy (think of something like LOVE ACTUALLY - where the PM falls for the tea girl). They work perfectly within their own context but held up to realistic analysis fail dismally. And it's the naturalism of the second strand that forces the viewer to consider the whole realistically. I was left utterly confused as to what I was watching. Or how I was supposed to.Although the acting is first-rate, this is also a deeply uncomfortable film to sit through. The rawness of the split up was too much for me. Add in some gratuitous sex scenes and implausibilities (if an ex-boyfriend of mine asked if I was unfaithful to my husband I'd be deeply offended not coquettish) and the result is a film that fails to convince or engage.I suppose BLUE VALENTINE wants its cake and to eat it too.

""Blue Valentine,"" is sort of like spending two hours with the Saturday Night Live characters, The Needlers, a.k.a. the Couple Who Should Be Divorced.  It's a brutally honest and authentic look at a dissolving marriage, as well as a good movie, but you may have moments where you're tempted to hit the Mute button.  Critics described this as ""haunting"" and ""powerful,"" and I fully agree.  But it's a movie I found painful to watch (because of the authenticity), and I don't think I'll ever see it again. It's easier to enjoy depressing movies if there's at least a tiny ray of hope present.Ryan Gosling who plays Dean, and Michelle Williams who plays Cindy, do an outstanding job of getting under the skin of their characters.  (Actually, I haven't seen them in anything where they did a poor job.)  All the characters behave like real people and not Hollywood ones.  When the mom fixes breakfast for her daughter on a weekday, she gives her a bowl of (mediocre) oatmeal, not a five-star gourmet spread, and the kid refuses to eat it.  This is not supposed to be proof that Cindy is a horrible mom, just frazzled.  When the grandmother is through being read a bedtime story, she sits up and demands a cigarette. When characters are asked a difficult question, they may actually respond with, ""I don't know,"" not some rapid-fire witty repartee that the scriptwriters spend hours getting just right.The movie starts out with Dean and Cindy as a middle-aged couple with a young child.  They have various issues which will be familiar to anyone in that situation.  In an attempt to rekindle their romance, Dean persuades Cindy to spend the night a motel.  We then get flashbacks of how they met and their lives leading up to the present.  They fight a lot.  They make up.  They have unsatisfying sexual experiences.  They fight some more.  There's absolutely no attempt to make any of this charming in the manner of a Hollywood romantic comedy.  That's why it's hard to watch.  But it will probably stay with you after you finish watching it.",4,"Honest, moving, but hard to watch",1306281600,"05 25, 2011",2011,2131,"['Roger', 'Ebert', 'once', 'wrote', 'movie', 'was', 'going', 'long', 'trip', 'Bickersons', 'Blue', 'Valentine', 'sort', 'spending', 'two', 'hours', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Live', 'characters', 'Needlers', 'a.k.a', 'Couple', 'Who', 'Should', 'Be', 'Divorced', 'brutally', 'honest', 'authentic', 'look', 'dissolving', 'marriage', 'as', 'well', 'good', 'movie', 'may', 'have', 'moments', 'where', ""'re"", 'tempted', 'hit', 'Mute', 'button', 'Critics', 'described', 'haunting', 'powerful', 'fully', 'agree', 'movie', 'found', 'painful', 'watch', 'authenticity', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'see', 'again', 'easier', 'enjoy', 'depressing', 'movies', 'least', 'tiny', 'ray', 'hope', 'Gosling', 'who', 'Dean', 'Michelle', 'Williams', 'who', 'Cindy', 'do', 'outstanding', 'job', 'getting', 'skin', 'characters', 'Actually', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'anything', 'where', 'did', 'poor', 'job', 'characters', 'behave', 'real', 'people', 'not', 'Hollywood', 'ones', 'When', 'mom', 'fixes', 'breakfast', 'daughter', 'weekday', 'bowl', 'mediocre', 'oatmeal', 'not', 'five-star', 'gourmet', 'spread', 'kid', 'eat', 'not', 'supposed', 'be', 'proof', 'Cindy', 'horrible', 'mom', 'just', 'frazzled', 'When', 'grandmother', 'being', 'read', 'bedtime', 'story', 'up', 'cigarette', 'When', 'characters', 'are', 'asked', 'difficult', 'question', 'may', 'actually', 'respond', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'not', 'rapid-fire', 'witty', 'repartee', 'scriptwriters', 'spend', 'hours', 'getting', 'just', 'right.The', 'movie', 'out', 'Dean', 'Cindy', 'middle-aged', 'couple', 'young', 'child', 'have', 'various', 'issues', 'will', 'be', 'familiar', 'anyone', 'situation', 'attempt', 'rekindle', 'romance', 'Dean', 'Cindy', 'spend', 'night', 'motel', 'then', 'get', 'flashbacks', 'how', 'met', 'lives', 'leading', 'up', 'present', 'fight', 'lot', 'make', 'up', 'have', 'unsatisfying', 'sexual', 'experiences', 'fight', 'more', 'absolutely', 'attempt', 'make', 'charming', 'manner', 'Hollywood', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'why', 'hard', 'watch', 'will', 'probably', 'stay', 'finish', 'watching']",N/A
1329056,A37IHRVO8JWYF2,B0036TGTDE,Emily D. Agunod,"[1, 4]","This is a gut-wrenching movie about the disintegration of a marriage.  What makes it gut-wrenching to me is that I think it was a problem that could have resolved.  In my opinion, these days, people tend to break up without giving their relationship a fighting chance.The movie flashes back and forth to the past and present.  Six years ago, Dean falls in love with Cindy at first sight. She doesn't go for it at first.  She was already dating someone and Dean, although extremely attractive, is just a moving van guy who dropped out of high school.  But he won her over because he has a great personality, very spontaneous and fun-loving.  Unfortunately, Cindy finds out she is pregnant with her ex-boyfriend's baby and she decided on getting an abortion.  She backs out at the last minute and Dean was so supportive and offered her marriage.I think the rift developed because Cindy, who initially wanted to be a doctor, still pursued education because she was working in a doctor's office, while Dean was just happy the way he was.  She thinks he has a lot of potential but he is quite content to have a lot of free time between jobs.  He is a terribly good dad to the daughter that wasn't even his and he kept trying to keep their relationship alive.  I found that really sad because most men won't do that.  But Cindy is the one who was fed up and disappointed that he also drinks but he wasn't really a bad guy.  She just felt she deserved more.Very sad to see a love that started beautifully just die.

1329057,A2SRZQU1SZG4RR,B0036TGTDE,"Erika Borsos ""pepper flower""","[1, 1]","This film opens with an idyllic scene of family life in a middle working class home, in a small town or rural setting in Pennsylvania. A young girl is shown playing in the yard, waiting for her dog to return. She sings and talks to herself, having a great time as children around ages 4 or 5 often do when they entertain themselves playing alone. She lookes for her dad, who is doting and loving, he reassures her their dog will return. They search in the backyard, look in his outdoor cage and doghouse. He is not there. This portion of the film is so well done, that it seems like a homemade movie or video of real life. The dad and daughter go upstairs, awaken the mom from a good sleep. She would rather have remained sleeping but ends up making breakfast, helping her daughter to dress for shcool and makes plans to go to her school recital later that day. It seems like a typical day for this family. However, there is just enough normalcy to make the viewer wonder, is it real or not?The mom and dad arrive separately at their daughter's grammar school for the program. Cindy is tearful and Dean asks ""what's wrong?"" She does not explain. Outside the school, Dean and Cindy briefly talk and make plans for a ""date night"". They explain to their daughter she will be staying overnight at her grandpa's house. She raises no objections and the stage is set for the exploration of unknown possibilties, peaking this viewer's interest and creating anticipation for what will happen next. This film is exceptional in how it captures the natural behaviors and emotions of the characters, leaving the viewer to wonder and question, where is this all going. Cindy prepares for their night out by shopping for liquor and accidentally meets a former boyfriend who was a serious old flame in the past. He asks if she is married, she replies ""yes"".  He replies, ""Lucky guy."" Next he asks, ""Are you faithful?"" She expresses surprise at the question and answers, ""Yes, I have been."" When Cindy tells Dean about meeting him by chance, she downplays the encounter, describing him as fat, to which Dean becomes angry and defensive. Dean's outburst at what seems like an innocent description by Cindy, reveals  his smoldering, up to this point unexpressed true emotions. The film is developing an edge that takes the viewer by surprise but which is a welcome development in the plot.Dean had rented the ""futuristic room"" at a local hotel; it looks like a motor home that was made into a hotel. The space is cramped but it is well designed, with a revolving bed, a wall behind the bed has an enlarged photo of earth from space. The honesty and realism in the film are palpable in how Dean and Cindy prepare for their special, intimate night out together. As they engage in adult behaviors, there are flashbacks to when they met, when their romance was new, exciting and they were a young couple in love. The flashbacks are in stark contrast to their current, cool, emotionally distant and withdrawn state. The passion of the past is so joyous, spontaneous and natural, that their current lack of emotional connection and fake intimacy becomes even more obvious.In this films there is a gradual crescendo of feelings and events which is highly satisfying. At times, the camera provides long and close shots of the characters revealing amazing acting. The story of the past, how this couple met, became interested in each other, built a committed relationship and married contrasts with their current life, filled with tensions and serious communication deficits. I am very surprised by Dean's immaturity, since in the beginning he seemed to have so much self control. He naturally took the lead in winning over Cindy's love and trust. I will not give away the ending but the viewer must decide at this point, whether or not I provided enough information to make viewing this film worthwhile. In my estimation it is a good film but I will deduct one star because at times it left me with a strong impression that both Dean and Cindy were working waaaaaaay to hard at expressing their emotions, in other words they ""over acted"" their parts.

In other words, we start by watching how Dean and Cindy's six year old daughter are in their house garden in Pennsylvania calling out for their disappeared pet.Immediately, we are overcome with a sense of loss, then an argument over breakfast and how it ought to be served surfaces the conflict experienced by this family unit. The couple goes to work, she is a nurse at a local hospital and he... a house painter. The film is shot with camera angles that are right on the actors to provide a rather intimate experience on the troubles of this family.Because the film is so out of order, we never see happiness until almost the end when we are allowed to partake on this couple's wedding day.The experience puts us through about six to seven years of this marriage as the couple reflects on their choices that has lead them into trouble.There are some sad moments, some difficult experiences and some moments that are sadly... funny.

I hadn't heard to much about it when it came out so I didn't pay much attention to it. But after reading the review of  this film from Sir William of Woopak I decided to give it a try. I am really glad I did now because the story is very real and the performances here are excellent.The film follows Michelle Williams and Ryan Gosling characters as they are trying to rekindle a dying marriage. After years it seems of one of them longing for more while the other is perfect with how they are they decide they need to save the marriage. So the plan a little get away to a motel that offers ""the future"" and the film is off. As we watch their relationship fall apart we also see how it all began. When these two were younger and very much falling in love. We go back and forth between the past and present seamlessly.I have to say the way the film was put together was really well done. They went back and forth with the past and present with perfection. You will see what I am talking about when you check it out. Also I have to say that while this subject has been done before the writers and director here did a good job making it feel real. That has always been a downfall for a lot films dealing with this subject, but here it is done really well.Also I have to say that the casting and acting was perfect in this film, particularly the stars. Michelle Williams did an excellent job here portraying a woman that yearns for more out of her life. She wants more from life but her husband is happy how they are, she also has a kid to think about. Ryan Gosling is brilliant as well as a man that can't seem to figure out what is wrong with the life they have and can't come to terms with what his wife wants. They really did a great job here.Now there are moments that some may not want to see and this is not a particularly happy film. Still with all that said I still think it is worth a rental at least. Sure it may not be for every body but it just may be for you.

1329060,AMY4RGZOEI4AC,B0036TGTDE,"Gigi R. ""Miss R.""","[1, 2]","The movie was definitely entertaining, at least to me and Ryan Gosling like always delivered a brilliant performance. I just found it so difficult to relate to Michelle Williams' character. So much so, that I walked away feeling angry for Ryan Gosling's character Dean and feeling that the movie at least for me left off in a note when you still ask, well then what's next?Ryan Gosling (Dean) works for a moving company in Brooklyn NY. While working he ends up in PA helping this old man transport and move his life to a nursing home. While there, he accidentally bumps into Michelle Williams (Cynthia) and falls in love at ""first sight"". The movie does a lot of bouncing back and forth from their first encounter and how they fell in love to their present state and how ultimately they break up.When the movie first begins you sympathize with Cynthia. You see her as a working mom with two children (her six year old daughter and her Middle aged Husband). You can see the frustration in the relationship and her lack of fulfillment. But as the movie progresses you learn that Cynthia had a boyfriend prior to meeting Dean. I mean like a few hours prior. The two had engaged in unprotected intercourse and had an accident. But shortly after that incident you have a flash back of how Dean returns to the nursing home to give the old man a locket and bumps into her. The two accidental bump into each other and spend the rest of the night together. They end the night as well with a love making session.Of course Cynthia ends up pregnant. And you are left wondering who the father could be? You say to yourself, well obviously its Dean's because they are married. Right?! Wrong. Its Cynthia's previous boyfriend who she dumps because of the ""accident they had during lovemaking"" and the guy NEVER knows he has a daughter. So Cynthia travels to NY where she tells Dean she's pregnant and tells him that its unlikely his. Nonetheless Dean accompanies her to get an abortion where you learn she's had 25 sexual partners beginning at 13 years of age. After going through the steps of prepping for the abortion (gurney straps and all) she changes her mind. Dean, rises to the occasion to be the father to another man's child, even after the real father jumps him because he thinks Dean just came between him and his girl.Don't get me wrong, you can see the socio-economic differences are obviously going to play a role in the ultimate undoing of this marriage. Cynthia is a college student (aspiring Medical Student who obviously becomes frustrated by the reality that she only becomes a nurse as opposed to a practicing doctor. Although dysfunctional and obviously playing a role in her emotional voidness, she does come from a middle income home in a nice suburban street. Dean on the other hand is a high school drop out from a broken home (his mother has walked out on him when he was 10) and views as being Cynthia's husband and their daughter's father as his greatest accomplishment. He also has a drinking problem that plays a role in their unraveling. To me the irony was that the person who seemed to have the most to offer in the relationship is the one that is less emotionally giving or able to give because of her surmounting issues. At the end of the film Cynthia tells Dean ""I have nothing left to give you"" and the truth is I was left wondering what exactly did you give in the first place? In the end I felt horrible for Dean. Jumping in to save this girl's honor, raise a child that wasn't his and in the very end what is he left with? Nothing. Nothing, yet he walks away never throwing in Cynthia's face all that he's done for her in terms of being that male role. But again, I was left wondering, what next? Does Frankie (their daughter) ever find out who her real dad is? Does Cynthia ever call her ex (during one scene in the movie she bumps into him in a liquor store). I really feel this movie culminated to an end right when I was at my angriest. Again, as a woman, I just find it so difficult to relate to Cynthia. As a PERSON I find it difficult to relate to her. And while you can argue she is a product of her emotionally empty and abusive environment (there is one scene where her father explodes at her mom over what she's made for dinner)....You still can't sympathize (at least I couldn't) with Cynthia's actions and lack of gratitude for a man who stepped into a relationship with her knowing all the baggage she was bringing to the table. Knowing that he would be essentially caring for a child that wasn't his biologically. To me her frustration is unfounded once the story unfolds and all the skeletons are revealed.It's still a brilliantly acted movie and if I took away 2 stars it was because I was just angered by one of the main characters. It is definitely a movie that allows you to reflect....it beckons you to reflect to make sense of why it ends the way it does.",3,******Spoiler Alert and Analysis****,1392508800,"02 16, 2014",2014,4902,"['movie', 'was', 'definitely', 'entertaining', 'least', 'Ryan', 'Gosling', 'always', 'delivered', 'brilliant', 'performance', 'just', 'found', 'so', 'difficult', 'relate', 'Michelle', 'Williams', 'character', 'So', 'much', 'walked', 'away', 'feeling', 'angry', 'Ryan', 'Gosling', 'character', 'Dean', 'feeling', 'movie', 'least', 'left', 'off', 'note', 'when', 'still', 'ask', 'well', 'then', 'what', 'next', 'Ryan', 'Gosling', 'Dean', 'moving', 'company', 'Brooklyn', 'NY', 'working', 'up', 'PA', 'helping', 'old', 'man', 'transport', 'move', 'life', 'nursing', 'home', 'there', 'accidentally', 'Michelle', 'Williams', 'Cynthia', 'love', 'first', 'sight', 'movie', 'lot', 'bouncing', 'back', 'forth', 'first', 'encounter', 'how', 'fell', 'love', 'present', 'state', 'how', 'ultimately', 'break', 'up.When', 'movie', 'first', 'sympathize', 'Cynthia', 'see', 'working', 'mom', 'two', 'children', 'six', 'year', 'old', 'daughter', 'Middle', 'aged', 'Husband', 'can', 'see', 'frustration', 'relationship', 'lack', 'fulfillment', 'movie', 'learn', 'Cynthia', 'had', 'boyfriend', 'prior', 'meeting', 'Dean', 'mean', 'few', 'hours', 'prior', 'two', 'had', 'engaged', 'unprotected', 'intercourse', 'had', 'accident', 'shortly', 'incident', 'have', 'flash', 'back', 'how', 'Dean', 'nursing', 'home', 'give', 'old', 'man', 'locket', 'bumps', 'two', 'accidental', 'bump', 'other', 'spend', 'rest', 'night', 'together', 'end', 'night', 'as', 'well', 'love', 'making', 'session.Of', 'course', 'Cynthia', 'up', 'pregnant', 'are', 'left', 'wondering', 'who', 'father', 'could', 'be', 'say', 'well', 'obviously', 'Dean', 'are', 'married', 'Right', 'Wrong', 'Cynthia', 'previous', 'boyfriend', 'who', 'accident', 'had', 'lovemaking', 'guy', 'NEVER', 'daughter', 'So', 'Cynthia', 'travels', 'NY', 'where', 'Dean', 'pregnant', 'unlikely', 'Nonetheless', 'Dean', 'get', 'abortion', 'where', 'learn', 'had', '25', 'sexual', 'partners', 'beginning', '13', 'years', 'age', 'going', 'steps', 'prepping', 'abortion', 'gurney', 'straps', 'mind', 'Dean', 'occasion', 'be', 'father', 'man', 'child', 'even', 'real', 'father', 'jumps', 'Dean', 'just', 'came', 'girl.Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'can', 'see', 'socio-economic', 'differences', 'are', 'obviously', 'going', 'play', 'role', 'ultimate', 'undoing', 'marriage', 'Cynthia', 'college', 'student', 'aspiring', 'Medical', 'Student', 'who', 'obviously', 'frustrated', 'reality', 'only', 'nurse', 'opposed', 'practicing', 'doctor', 'dysfunctional', 'obviously', 'playing', 'role', 'emotional', 'voidness', 'come', 'middle', 'income', 'home', 'nice', 'suburban', 'street', 'Dean', 'other', 'hand', 'high', 'school', 'drop', 'broken', 'home', 'mother', 'walked', 'out', 'when', 'was', '10', 'views', 'being', 'Cynthia', 'husband', 'daughter', 'father', 'greatest', 'accomplishment', 'also', 'drinking', 'problem', 'role', 'unraveling', 'irony', 'was', 'person', 'who', 'seemed', 'have', 'most', 'offer', 'relationship', 'one', 'less', 'emotionally', 'giving', 'able', 'give', 'surmounting', 'issues', 'end', 'film', 'Cynthia', 'Dean', 'have', 'nothing', 'left', 'give', 'truth', 'was', 'left', 'wondering', 'what', 'exactly', 'did', 'give', 'first', 'place', 'end', 'felt', 'horrible', 'Dean', 'Jumping', 'save', 'girl', 'honor', 'raise', 'child', 'was', ""n't"", 'very', 'end', 'what', 'left', 'Nothing', 'Nothing', 'yet', 'away', 'never', 'throwing', 'Cynthia', 'face', 'done', 'terms', 'being', 'male', 'role', 'again', 'was', 'left', 'wondering', 'what', 'next', 'Frankie', 'daughter', 'ever', 'find', 'out', 'who', 'real', 'dad', 'Does', 'Cynthia', 'ever', 'call', 'ex', 'one', 'scene', 'movie', 'bumps', 'liquor', 'store', 'really', 'feel', 'movie', 'culminated', 'end', 'right', 'when', 'was', 'angriest', 'Again', 'woman', 'just', 'find', 'so', 'difficult', 'relate', 'Cynthia', 'PERSON', 'find', 'difficult', 'relate', 'can', 'argue', 'product', 'emotionally', 'empty', 'abusive', 'environment', 'one', 'scene', 'where', 'father', 'explodes', 'mom', 'what', 'made', 'dinner', '.You', 'still', 'ca', ""n't"", 'sympathize', 'least', 'could', ""n't"", 'Cynthia', 'actions', 'lack', 'gratitude', 'man', 'who', 'stepped', 'relationship', 'knowing', 'baggage', 'was', 'bringing', 'table', 'Knowing', 'would', 'be', 'essentially', 'caring', 'child', 'was', ""n't"", 'biologically', 'frustration', 'unfounded', 'once', 'story', 'unfolds', 'skeletons', 'are', 'revealed.It', 'still', 'brilliantly', 'acted', 'movie', 'took', 'away', '2', 'stars', 'was', 'was', 'just', 'angered', 'one', 'main', 'characters', 'definitely', 'movie', 'reflect', '.it', 'beckons', 'reflect', 'make', 'sense', 'why', 'way']",N/A

1329063,A328S9RN3U5M68,B0036TGTDE,Grady Harp,"[3, 5]","Nonlinear storytelling, whether in a novel or a film, challenges the reader/viewer with fragments of story scattered across time and coincidences in a way that can create disorientation: the payback is that this technique of relating a story allows an intimate examination of  not only the characters of the tale but also an opportunity to turn the events inward, perhaps reviving memories, piecing together reasons for the present and the journey taken simultaneously with the development of the story.  Director Derek Cianfrance (a young writer, cinematographer and director of remarkable skill) worked with Cami Delavigne and Joey Curtis to develop this examination of a dismembering relationship that probably should have never begun. And while the story per se takes place in a 24 hour period, it exposes all the cracks and interstices that have created the breaking point in their marriage by flashbacks that often seem to flow with the story at hand.Dean Pereira (Ryan Gosling) is a house painter whose motivation to work is to be married to Cindy Heller Pereira (Michelle Williams), an ultrasound technician for Dr. Feinberg (Ben Shenkman), and their daughter Frankie (Faith Waldyka). Dean was a high school dropout without a stable family history and therefore not interested in marriage or family: Cindy's family was also dysfunctional but she had a closeness to her grandmother who encouraged her dreams of becoming a doctor.  Dean meets Cindy and his dreams change - he wants to do anything to be with her. Cindy's motivations altered when she became pregnant, not knowing whether the father was Dean or her other passionate flame Bobby (Mike Vogel).  Dean is supportive and loves Cindy to the point that despite the paternity question he marries Cindy.  With that much of a past given to us in snippets we begin the story on a routine day- Dean has grown scruffy and needs a drink to get his day going and would rather play with Frankie than work at his low paying job, while Cindy runs the motor that keeps the home afloat, dashing off to practice her craft. Two incidents occur: Cindy encounters Bobby at a liquor store and a flame simmers while Dean leaves a gate open a home that leads to the loss of heir pet animal. Both are tense and Dean makes a reservation to spend the night in a motel love nest - not Cindy's idea of romance.  How the two make it through that night away form home  and the altered 'home' they return to the next morning is the meat of the story.Both Ryan Gosling and Cindy Williams give informed and intuitive performances, creating characters out of these two people to whom we can relate and care about. The couple they portray is fragile and the manner in which each actor reveals the varying view of the other pulses with passion.  The side stories that arise out of their past - especially the manner in which each of these two disparate characters relate to senile people restricted to extended care facilities - are models of fine writing married to fine acting.  This is a dark movie and the cinematographer and director quite suggestively underline the title by shooting the night at the motel business in a cold blue light.  It may not be a love story that the term valentine suggests, but it is a superb examination of how relationships can dismember with time.

Some of the credit goes to the script, which manages to convey more by saying less. ""Blue Valentine"" does not rely on the mawkish sentiment and/or  weepy soundtrack that helped doom ""My Sisters Keeper"" nor is it a paint-by-numbers ""chick flick"" like ""The Notebook."" Dean and Cindy (Ryan Gosling and Michelle Williams) are much like any young couple that fall in love at first sight but then struggle when reality sets in. The film follows Dean and Cindy for 24 hours as they try to rekindle their passon. This is not a happy film, but the performances are first rate. Williams is wonderful as she slowly realizes that she has simply outgrown the relationship with her husband - she says more with her muted expressions of sadness than if she screamed and cried. Her Oscar nomination was deserved but even Williams' performance is dwarfed by Gosling's. His performance as the simple, comfortable Dean is magnificent, and he is painfully real as he watches Cindy slip away. Much like his work in ""The Slaughterhouse Rules"" and ""Half Nelson,"" Gosling is able to shed his hunkiness for reality.

It's the story of a couple's romance told in two alternating parts - the part where they get together and the part where they split up.  The funny thing about it is that it's really a chick flick, but the filmmakers are men.  In the commentary they talk about how they came to make the movie - something they worked to get off the ground for 12 years.  You have to give them credit for sticking with the project.  And the thing is, they should be very proud of what they did.  This movie is very well-made and incredibly well acted by a couple of the best actors in Hollywood in the leading roles.  However, there's no Hollywood schmaltz in this movie.  It is a brutally realistic portrayal of the heartbreak of a failed relationship.

1329068,AL8IDHJPCE00K,B0036TGTDE,H,"[1, 3]","Blue Valentine is the painful, gut wrenching look at the modern meltdown of a marriage. The movie shows us in small clips what is currently happening , and how the two characters got to where they are. You essentially get both stories at once and it unfolds in a unsuprising yet striking way. There is some excellent acting by both Williams, and Gosling, especially the latter. The movie tells of how two young people fell in love, and came to be married, and are now parents. However, it's painfully obvious from the start that they are in two different places in their lives and have not grown together. One is independent, and one is painfully co-dependent. The abuse, and pain are reminiscent of the true downturn of so many marriages, and it's an almost documentary of the slow, cruel, unraveling of a marriage and the inside of what it looks like- from a night spent trying to reconnect, to a fight in an office, crying, insults, rage, and all of the turmoil and emotions that can brew as the end of something unfolds. There is nudity, and bad language, and some violence- obviously check the rating on it. If you don't like indie type movies with an honest, raw edge then you may not like this. If you like feel good movies then you won't like this. But, if you don't mind the look at the sometimes nastier, troubling parts of life then you may atleast be able to appreciate this movie. I really liked it. Not because I like to see people in turmoil but because I think it's really honest, and true and shows the parts that a lot of people like to skip when we use the word divorce. It's painful, but there is some human element to it, and great acting. It's filmed in a unique way, and you are torn as a viewer. I root for the younger couple falling in love, but I mourn for the couple they become and long for them to be apart, or to find their freedom away from each other. I've never been divorced but I lived through my parents tumultuous relationship until they divorced when I was 5. I have been in relationships that suffocated me, and ultimately ended. It's the hope of course that anyone struggling in a marriage would find a way to salvage it, but this is a true look at why some simple cannot be salvaged.",4,A touching contemporary look at the modern breakup/meltdown of a marriage,1307059200,"06 3, 2011",2011,2224,"['Blue', 'Valentine', 'painful', 'gut', 'wrenching', 'look', 'modern', 'meltdown', 'marriage', 'movie', 'small', 'clips', 'what', 'currently', 'happening', 'how', 'two', 'characters', 'got', 'where', 'are', 'essentially', 'get', 'stories', 'once', 'unsuprising', 'yet', 'striking', 'way', 'excellent', 'acting', 'Williams', 'Gosling', 'especially', 'latter', 'movie', 'tells', 'how', 'two', 'young', 'people', 'fell', 'love', 'came', 'be', 'married', 'are', 'now', 'parents', 'However', 'painfully', 'obvious', 'start', 'are', 'two', 'different', 'places', 'lives', 'have', 'not', 'grown', 'together', 'One', 'independent', 'one', 'painfully', 'co-dependent', 'abuse', 'pain', 'are', 'reminiscent', 'true', 'downturn', 'so', 'many', 'marriages', 'almost', 'documentary', 'slow', 'cruel', 'unraveling', 'marriage', 'inside', 'what', 'like-', 'night', 'spent', 'trying', 'reconnect', 'fight', 'office', 'crying', 'insults', 'rage', 'turmoil', 'emotions', 'can', 'brew', 'end', 'something', 'unfolds', 'nudity', 'bad', 'language', 'violence-', 'obviously', 'check', 'rating', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'indie', 'type', 'movies', 'honest', 'raw', 'edge', 'then', 'may', 'not', 'like', 'like', 'feel', 'good', 'movies', 'then', 'wo', ""n't"", 'like', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'look', 'sometimes', 'nastier', 'troubling', 'parts', 'life', 'then', 'may', 'atleast', 'be', 'able', 'appreciate', 'movie', 'really', 'liked', 'Not', 'like', 'see', 'people', 'turmoil', 'think', 'really', 'honest', 'true', 'parts', 'lot', 'people', 'skip', 'when', 'use', 'word', 'divorce', 'painful', 'human', 'element', 'great', 'acting', 'filmed', 'unique', 'way', 'are', 'torn', 'viewer', 'root', 'younger', 'couple', 'falling', 'love', 'mourn', 'couple', 'become', 'long', 'be', 'apart', 'find', 'freedom', 'away', 'other', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'divorced', 'lived', 'parents', 'tumultuous', 'relationship', 'divorced', 'when', 'was', '5', 'have', 'been', 'relationships', 'suffocated', 'ultimately', 'ended', 'hope', 'course', 'anyone', 'struggling', 'marriage', 'would', 'find', 'way', 'salvage', 'true', 'look', 'why', 'simple', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'salvaged']",N/A

""Blue Valentine,"" the first major film from writer/director Derek Cianfrance, plays tug of war with your heart for its entire running length. It is a stunning debut from Cianfrance that takes a familiar tune and strips it down to its most raw and unflinching form. This is a film that lives and breathes, as we experience the flames of love being extinguished before our very eyes by the harsh realities of life.""Blue Valentine"" stars Ryan Gosling and Michelle Williams, two of Hollywood's most talented and courageous actors, in a very low-budgeted, non-Hollywood film that centers on the rise and fall of a young couple's relationship, as they fall out of love after years of marriage.The film begins in the present, and then skips back and forth through time, showing the young couple at two different times in their relationship, from first time that they met to their now doomed and dissolving marriage. Structurally, this can sometimes be a distracting and confusing ploy to make a story of falling romance seem more interesting than it is. That is not the case here, and the film is wonderfully edited.Gosling plays Dean, once a childish but devoted guy who has no big plans for the future except to keep on living each day, waiting for whatever the world has in store for him. He is a nice guy, but as the films reverts the present, we see that being a nice guy is not enough to sustain a happy marriage.Dean's tendency to sit back and be content eventually becomes too much for Cindy (Williams) to deal with. She is a charismatic girl in the beginning who wants to be a doctor one day. When she meets Dean for the first time in the nursing home where her grandmother lives, and where Dean, working for a moving company, is moving in an elderly man, their eyes connect. In that moment, the two actors make us believe that this is something special.These scenes in the past are so wonderfully acted, as the nave and passionate lovers connect and embrace, make love and share each other's dreams.  These passages in the film make it all the more painful when we are reminded of the present, where the passion and honesty are dissolving at a rapid pace. They also have a daughter named Frankie (Faith Wladyka) who was not planned, but who is accepted and loved deeply by her feuding parents.Told in a linear fashion, I think ""Blue Valentine"" would lose a lot of its substance. The big question of what went wrong is never explicitly answered, and I am not certain there is one answer. There is so much authenticity and power in the performances, particularly Williams, who does the most challenging and brilliant work of her career. To pull off the small jump in age (10 or 15 years) that she and Gosling perform effortlessly here seem like it would be incredibly difficult. We are so emotionally invested in Dean and Cindy's lives that we don't doubt it for a second.""Blue Valentine"" stirred up quite a controversy in the movie world when it initially earned an NC-17 rating from the MPAA for a scene of explicit sexuality. After a successful petition, the rating was rightfully dropped to an R. It's a silly thought that in our society, movies like ""Piranha 3D"" and ""Saw"" that contain such gratuitous violence can pass with R-ratings, but as for sexuality (GOD, LET IT NOT BE SO!) there is so little tolerance to spare.This film is a work of art that realizes that in life, there are few easy paths to take. Many questions go unanswered and many days pass unremarkably. From what I have come to understand, the method by which Cianfrance and the two stars handled the material was through much improvisation, which allows for spontaneity and authenticity if handled well. Williams and Gosling are so astonishingly intense and real in this movie that at times it is difficult to watch.But those who can stomach the searing performances will experience a tremendous story of found and lost romance, and one of the best films of 2010.GRADE: A",4,Love is [not] all you need,1298937600,"03 1, 2011",2011,4043,"['are', 'films', 'manage', 'simultaneously', 'warm', 'hearts', 'moviegoers', 'break', 'Blue', 'Valentine', 'first', 'major', 'film', 'writer/director', 'Derek', 'Cianfrance', 'tug', 'war', 'heart', 'entire', 'running', 'length', 'stunning', 'debut', 'Cianfrance', 'familiar', 'tune', 'down', 'most', 'raw', 'unflinching', 'form', 'film', 'breathes', 'experience', 'flames', 'love', 'being', 'extinguished', 'very', 'eyes', 'harsh', 'realities', 'life', 'Blue', 'Valentine', 'Ryan', 'Gosling', 'Michelle', 'Williams', 'two', 'Hollywood', 'most', 'talented', 'courageous', 'actors', 'very', 'low-budgeted', 'non-Hollywood', 'film', 'rise', 'fall', 'young', 'couple', 'relationship', 'fall', 'love', 'years', 'marriage.The', 'film', 'present', 'then', 'skips', 'back', 'forth', 'time', 'showing', 'young', 'couple', 'two', 'different', 'times', 'relationship', 'first', 'time', 'met', 'now', 'doomed', 'dissolving', 'marriage', 'Structurally', 'can', 'sometimes', 'be', 'distracting', 'confusing', 'ploy', 'make', 'story', 'falling', 'romance', 'seem', 'more', 'interesting', 'not', 'case', 'here', 'film', 'wonderfully', 'edited.Gosling', 'plays', 'Dean', 'once', 'childish', 'devoted', 'guy', 'who', 'big', 'plans', 'future', 'keep', 'living', 'day', 'waiting', 'world', 'store', 'nice', 'guy', 'films', 'present', 'see', 'being', 'nice', 'guy', 'not', 'enough', 'sustain', 'happy', 'marriage.Dean', 'tendency', 'sit', 'back', 'be', 'content', 'eventually', 'too', 'much', 'Cindy', 'Williams', 'deal', 'charismatic', 'girl', 'beginning', 'who', 'be', 'doctor', 'one', 'day', 'When', 'Dean', 'first', 'time', 'nursing', 'home', 'where', 'grandmother', 'lives', 'where', 'Dean', 'working', 'moving', 'company', 'moving', 'elderly', 'man', 'eyes', 'connect', 'moment', 'two', 'actors', 'make', 'believe', 'something', 'special.These', 'scenes', 'past', 'are', 'so', 'wonderfully', 'acted', 'nave', 'passionate', 'lovers', 'connect', 'embrace', 'make', 'love', 'share', 'other', 'dreams', 'passages', 'film', 'make', 'more', 'painful', 'when', 'are', 'reminded', 'present', 'where', 'passion', 'honesty', 'are', 'dissolving', 'rapid', 'pace', 'also', 'have', 'daughter', 'named', 'Frankie', 'Faith', 'Wladyka', 'who', 'was', 'not', 'planned', 'who', 'accepted', 'loved', 'deeply', 'feuding', 'parents.Told', 'linear', 'fashion', 'think', 'Blue', 'Valentine', 'would', 'lose', 'lot', 'substance', 'big', 'question', 'what', 'went', 'wrong', 'never', 'explicitly', 'answered', 'am', 'not', 'certain', 'one', 'answer', 'so', 'much', 'authenticity', 'power', 'performances', 'particularly', 'Williams', 'who', 'most', 'challenging', 'brilliant', 'work', 'career', 'pull', 'off', 'small', 'jump', 'age', '10', '15', 'years', 'Gosling', 'perform', 'effortlessly', 'here', 'seem', 'would', 'be', 'incredibly', 'difficult', 'are', 'so', 'emotionally', 'invested', 'Dean', 'Cindy', 'lives', 'do', ""n't"", 'doubt', 'second', 'Blue', 'Valentine', 'stirred', 'up', 'quite', 'controversy', 'movie', 'world', 'when', 'initially', 'earned', 'NC-17', 'rating', 'MPAA', 'scene', 'explicit', 'sexuality', 'successful', 'petition', 'rating', 'was', 'rightfully', 'dropped', 'R.', 'silly', 'thought', 'society', 'movies', 'Piranha', '3D', 'Saw', 'contain', 'such', 'gratuitous', 'violence', 'can', 'pass', 'R-ratings', 'sexuality', 'GOD', 'LET', 'IT', 'NOT', 'BE', 'SO', 'so', 'little', 'tolerance', 'spare.This', 'film', 'work', 'art', 'life', 'are', 'few', 'easy', 'paths', 'take', 'Many', 'questions', 'go', 'unanswered', 'many', 'days', 'pass', 'unremarkably', 'what', 'have', 'come', 'understand', 'method', 'Cianfrance', 'two', 'stars', 'handled', 'material', 'was', 'through', 'much', 'improvisation', 'spontaneity', 'authenticity', 'handled', 'well', 'Williams', 'Gosling', 'are', 'so', 'astonishingly', 'intense', 'real', 'movie', 'times', 'difficult', 'watch.But', 'who', 'can', 'stomach', 'searing', 'performances', 'will', 'experience', 'tremendous', 'story', 'found', 'lost', 'romance', 'one', 'best', 'films', '2010.GRADE', 'A']",N/A
1329077,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B0036TGTDE,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[3, 5]","To put it simply, Blue Valentine tells a modern love story of the birth and death of a modern relationship. The film acts as a window through which to view this relationship and see the conflicting ideas and personalities that once brought two people together but now drive them apart. Relying heavily on improvisation, the success of the film rests with its two leads and rarely have I seen actors pour their heart and soul into their performances the way Ryan Gosling and Michelle Williams have here. There's a lot of raw emotion on display, yet there are no cheap theatrics nor is anything over-sentimentalized. It's a rare movie about love and marriage that may strike a little too close to home for some viewers.The story cross-cuts between two different time periods, but begins with introducing us to a working-class married couple named Dean (Gosling) and Cindy (Williams), and their young daughter Frankie. Dean is a house-painter and a dedicated, hands-on father who has settled comfortably into his marriage and his working-class existence. Cindy is a nurse whom we can tell from only body language has outgrown Dean, but Dean seems either unaware or unable to accept it. In an attempt to reignite the passion, Dean makes a reservation at a cheesy sex motel (in the Future Room). These present-day scenes are shot on RED, a digital camera that gives the film a monotonous, dull color palette, but a more intimate feel. The early scenes are shot on Super 16MM and make the scenes feel much brighter and more alive. This technique remarkably contrasts the more idealistic beginning with the cold, hard reality of the end. Frequent use of a hand-held camera makes these scenes feel much more personal. In the early scenes, Dean works for a moving company and meets Cindy at a retirement home, where she's visiting her grandmother. Subtle physical changes are employed to show Dean and Cindy at these different, but relatively close ages.Director and co-writer Derek Cianfrance doesn't play with the chronology of the story as a gimmick, but as a way to toy with our emotions. An example takes place in the Future Room when Dean puts on a song and tries to dance with Cindy. It's clear that this scene is where Dean really becomes aware of how disconnected Cindy is from him, but we don't think much about the music. Later in the film, but taking place earlier, we see Dean playing Cindy the song for the first time and we see the romantic significance it has for them. If Cianfrance had told his story in chronological order, this latter scene would be a happy moment but in showing us later we sadly realize how far this relationship has progressed downward. Cianfrance spent years trying to finance this project and his directorial talent is made clear. His raw, loose, and revealing style recalls the work of John Cassavetes but he's not just an imitation of talent. He's very adept at framing his shots to achieve the maximum emotional effect possible and must be given credit for directing two actor's to give some of the most soul-shattering performances I've seen recently.Not to downplay what a depressing film this is, but if you're expecting an emotional powerhouse of a film with a lot of yelling, screaming, Oscar-baiting performances you'll be surprised. The film maintains an understated realism throughout; not every argument escalates into a shouting match, not every significant moment is heightened in Hollywood-fashion to show that it means something, and the character's never spout off any wooden lines of dialogue to explain what we can already see happening. Compare and contrast Dean and Cindy's relationship with the strained relationship portrayed in another terrific 2010 filmRabbit Holeand you will see how understated this film is. Even Dean's first encounter with Cindy, while cute and charming, is as understated as every scene before it when, in a lesser film it would be written and filmed to be a more dramatic, profound moment in the lives of the characters. You rarely meet the one you love under extraordinary, theatrical circumstances. Dean and Cindy never feel like characters trapped in a doomed Hollywood romance. They're vulnerable, sensitive, and normal people who can't allow their emotions to go unrestrained any longer. It's heartbreaking stuff, but it never exploits the two nor does it make any attempts to obscure their flaws. With that said, much of the film's impact stems from how you relate and apply the characters' struggles to your own life.Dean is the more sympathetic character of the two and many will leave thinking negatively of Cindy, but I found it easier to empathize with her as the film progressed. The film shows only the birth and the death of the relationship and we are never told what exactly went wrong. This may bother some people, but I found this to be one of the more poignant aspects of the film. How many can remember a relationship from the beginning, through the middle, and to the end? In life, we usually cut out the middle too. We see the end of a marriage that is without passion and, in Cindy's case, love but nothing seems particularly...wrong. Dean drinks often, but isn't portrayed as an alcoholic and he's a very involved father. It seems that Cindy just gets bored and, yet I did sympathize with her because of how well Williams conveyed Cindy's feelings, especially the toll that mental exhaustion has taken on her plight.Michelle Williams received an Oscar nomination, but Ryan Gosling did not. Gosling gives the kind of performance where an actor immerses themselves so deeply into the material that the actor disappears and the character takes over. Gosling captures every nuance playing the decidedly average guy Dean so perfectly. It's a performance that taps into some very dark emotions and never seems more dramatic than necessary. Gosling could've chewed the scenery with this role, but he just plays it real. Few performances are more capable of breaking your heart than this. Williams opens herself completely to her character and portrays a woman trudging through a marriage that she's long given up on for no discernible reason other than she has outgrown Dean. Cindy is a selfish character, only sympathetic as someone who must escape the confines of her marriage rather than suffer for the rest of her life the way her parents did. There's not a line of dialogue that makes Cindy more sympathetic, yet I didn't hate her at the end of the film just because of how Williams carried this role. Cindy is not so much a selfish woman, as a lost one who can conceal her emotional disdain for her life and marriage no more. It's a compelling performance, that relies heavily on body language but I feel like Gosling was robbed of a nomination.The improvisational nature of the film is very useful and helps tell this story with more realism than any script could. The dialogue especially feels so loose and natural you know it couldn't be written. One example of how the improvisation works so well is the scene that was most prevalent in the trailer and is, in my opinion, the most remarkable scene in the film. Dean plays a ukulele and sings, while Cindy dances. This is such a beautiful scene that expresses so much about the characters at this stage in their life. In this moment, there's such freedom and a very subtle poignancy. It is so romantic in its simplistic way, it makes the relationship seem so much more real and seeing it end so much more tragic.Much attention came to the film when the MPAA slapped it with an NC-17 rating, only to give it an `R' rating on appeal with no cuts being made. The sex scenes are not particularly graphic, far from gratuitous, and in no way erotic. Sex has rarely been used as effectively onscreen to illustrate a total loss of passion in a relationship, as well as contrasting something that was once pleasurable and is now devoid of meaning. I think the MPAA was more frightened by the emotional power of these scenes than they were of any of the physical intimacy.Blue Valentine is not an easy film to digest and some will dismiss it as emotional, depressing, and pointless fodder. It's not a happy film nor is it a film that gives easy answers to tough questions about modern relationships. In life, many things don't turn out happy and many questions are left unanswered. The ending may not satisfy viewers, but I found the stunning end credits served as an epilogue almost and, if not, certainly a eulogy. It's a special, powerful film with both realism and a sense of irony (it's ironic that the Future Room is where it becomes clear that Dean and Cindy's marriage has no future) and a film that I have a hard time putting out of my mind. Ultimately, it's a revealing look at modern love and the film's intimacy and willingness to plunge the depths of this subject make it an experience of unusual depth and perception. While it's hard to enjoy Blue Valentine, I loved Blue Valentine.GRADE: A",5,A Stunning Portrait of a Modern Relationship,1297900800,"02 17, 2011",2011,8951,"['put', 'simply', 'Blue', 'Valentine',

If you appreciate a well-acted, well-directed story, Blue Valentine is a must see.Fans of the romance genre are appalled at the fact that this movie does not have a happy ending. Guess what, sometimes things in life do not end well. Blue Valentine is a story of two people who marry early and end up falling out of love. Relationships can be like fitting a square peg in a circular whole--despite everyone's best efforts and intentions they are simply not a good fit. This is the case for the couple in this movie.The movie is comprised of two simultaneous stories: a flashback the young couple meeting, and the disenchanted married couple in the present time. The story is very emotional and believable and the characters are well acted. Many scenes are rather uncomfortable to watch--we wish Ryan Gosling's character would be less awkward, and that Michelle Williams's character would be more communicative with her husband.In an age when most movies are all filler and no substance, Blue Valentine stands out as a film that is gripping and real. You will find no outlandish story or happy ending here, just an emotional view into the life of a couple falling out of love.I would recommend only watching this movie if you are emotionally stable.",5,A great anti-love story,1338768000,"06 4, 2012",2012,1330,"['are', 'fan', 'cheesy', 'romance', 'movies', 'Blue', 'Valentine', 'probably', 'not', 'appreciate', 'well-acted', 'well-directed', 'story', 'Blue', 'Valentine', 'must', 'see.Fans', 'romance', 'genre', 'are', 'appalled', 'fact', 'movie', 'not', 'have', 'happy', 'ending', 'Guess', 'what', 'sometimes', 'things', 'life', 'do', 'not', 'end', 'well', 'Blue', 'Valentine', 'story', 'two', 'people', 'who', 'marry', 'early', 'end', 'up', 'falling', 'love', 'Relationships', 'can', 'be', 'fitting', 'square', 'peg', 'circular', 'whole', 'everyone', 'best', 'efforts', 'intentions', 'are', 'simply', 'not', 'good', 'fit', 'case', 'couple', 'movie.The', 'movie', 'comprised', 'two', 'simultaneous', 'stories', 'flashback', 'young', 'couple', 'meeting', 'disenchanted', 'married', 'couple', 'present', 'time', 'story', 'very', 'emotional', 'believable', 'characters', 'are', 'well', 'acted', 'Many', 'scenes', 'are', 'rather', 'uncomfortable', 'watch', 'wish', 'Ryan', 'Gosling', 'character', 'would', 'be', 'less', 'awkward', 'Michelle', 'Williams', 'character', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'communicative', 'husband.In', 'age', 'when', 'most', 'movies', 'are', 'filler', 'substance', 'Blue', 'Valentine', 'out', 'film', 'gripping', 'real', 'will', 'find', 'outlandish', 'story', 'happy', 'ending', 'here', 'just', 'emotional', 'view', 'life', 'couple', 'falling', 'love.I', 'would', 'recommend', 'only', 'watching', 'movie', 'are', 'emotionally', 'stable']",N/A
1329079,A3M6RVUVZOQZLB,B0036TGTDE,"Judy K. Polhemus ""Book Collector""","[4, 6]","If only we could see into the future a year, five years, ten, pick one--it will be the right one concerning marriage. We go into a marriage with all these hopes, this love, this shared life and truly, truly believe that we will finish the race together, stay bonded, stay in love. ""Blue Valentine"" is more truthful than not. Michelle Williams as Cindy, the one with goals, with ""potential,"" discovers that Dean (Ryan Gosling) is not her Prince Charming. But she knew that going into the relationship. What goes wrong in a marriage? When? If love dies, can it be resurrected? Resparked? Repaired? Made new again?Director Derek Clanfrance says no in this case. The title ""Blue Valentine"" tells us that this will be no happy ending, but it is more than ""blue."" It is black and devastating and hopeless. That fairy tale that began the story played out into a walk into the deep, deep woods. That's where Dean goes. Cindy and their precious and precocious six-year old daughter stay right on the edge.But like the director's time line switching, this review cuts and jumps, too. His method is definitely interesting and innovative. One moment of the past indicates the future. One moment of the Now can be explained by a moment past. It's like this: ________________________. Now take a pair of scissors, snip here and there and rearrange the snippets into a new telling.Dean, a high school dropout, works for a moving van company when he meets Cindy so serendipitously. He is moving Walter, a really frail 90-something-year-old man, into a nursing home where Cindy's grandmother lives. That's how they meet and Dean falls in love. A major revelation of this scene is how tender-hearted Dean is toward Walter. He unpacks his things and sets them up so that Walter leaves one abode and right into a new one with all his familiar things around him, hopefully erasing any feeling of dislocation.On their ""first date"" he makes Cindy laugh. Cindy is not given to laughter. With medical school way down her line of vision, with studying and classes filling her time, Cindy is not spontaneous nor does she particularly want to be. Dean makes her see the little excitements all around, the random sprinkling of fun and good times just there for the taking. In fact, he has a bit of frantic magic about him. She gets pregnant (of course). I think early on she sees him for what he is--a fun guy, not a dependable guy. They marry. She needs a dad for her baby.Then all those things we choose not to see at the beginning annoy each other. As usually happens, first one dig, then another and another, and the two are six years down the road that looks like a dead-end. The death of the family dog pretty much initiates final death throes of this ill-fated union. Dean schedules a silly overnight stay at a themed hotel to ramp up the passion. It does not work.The downward spiral escalates. He forces her to acknowledge her feelings. Death, nothing in her heart but dead feelings. He cannot make her recapture those early emotions because they weren't the right ones anyway. They were young and thoughtless and clueless. Life threw them down the road like rolling dice. Where did they land?Ryan Gosling is simply amazing as the very annoying, very charming Dean, bound on a road to either ruin or redemption. Michelle Williams plays her careful character close to the heart, trying to hold without breaking. She makes her fragility palpable. The annoying chatter of her husband, his ridiculous drinking, his childish behavior surely are fingernails on her chalkboard.""Blue Valentine"" was not a fun movie, but it was a powerful portrayal of Art imitating life. No, not imitating, being life. The story was straight and sure and true. And sad beyond words.

Luckily, the rating was rightfully overturned so the picture could enjoy a wider release and the benefits of a more extensive advertising campaign. ""Blue Valentine"" is a sophisticated and smart entertainment for adult audiences brought to realistic fruition by the stellar Ryan Gosling and Michelle Williams. Naturalistic and utterly believable, rarely has a film been able to dissect a relationship with such savvy attention to detail.You might have heard that ""Blue Valentine"" is a story about the dissolution of a relationship, about a couple growing apart. I would contend, however, that it is instead a contemporary love story. Set in alternate timelines, ""Blue Valentine"" charts Gosling and Williams both at the beginning of their courtship as well as when their marriage is nearing an end. Shot in an easy improvised style, the earlier moments have charming tenderness while the later segments have a quiet poignancy and sadness. Instead of opting for big scenes and pinpointing singular causes, ""Blue Valentine"" simply has our couple drifting down different paths. Neither is the particular cause of the estrangement, but Williams pulls back emotionally as Gosling holds on frantically. Both want what's best for each other and their daughter, although they no longer see eye to eye about what that is. Truthful, excruciating, and intimate--""Blue Valentine"" plants us in the middle.Gosling and Williams are, in a word, extraordinary. I have, for many years, declared Ryan Gosling perhaps the best actor of his generation. Ever since he burst onto the film scene in the controversial ""The Believer,"" Gosling has eschewed being a mainstream ""star."" Heck, after ""The Notebook,"" another actor might have taken a very different career path. But Gosling, despite a couple of disappointing forays into big budget Hollywood, has remained true to his indie roots. And Williams has left her ""Dawson's Creek"" past way behind her as she continues to choose interesting and meaningful projects. They work off each other with ease. The film was improvisational in nature and many scenes are made real by Williams and Gosling playing off one another extemporaneously. Now that's true indie cinema!Anyone who's been in a relationship and/or a break up will be able to identify with the inherent realness behind ""Blue Valentine."" There are little moments of silliness, big moments of anger, and everything in between. ""Blue Valentine"" expertly juxtaposes the different stages of this coupling and the results are both terrifically funny and awesomely sad. Pretty much like life itself, huh? A great modern romance about breaking up, ""Blue Valentine"" is easily one of the year's least contrived and most heartfelt films. And it contains two of the year's best performances! About 4 1/2 stars--rounding up for Gosling and Williams.

I had no clue what it was about, but love his independent nature and courageous role choices, so I ""had"" to get this movie when I heard about it.That said, I figured this would be a nice ""relaxing"" movie..Heck, it's a love story, right?  It has the word, ""Valentine"" in it.  Well, yes, but it also has the word, ""Blue"" in it, which is more about how this movie plays out.  It is devastatingly sad.Ryan plays a lovable, blue-collar working man, Dean.  He has worked a variety of odd jobs, but doesn't allow his job or income to determine who he is inside.  He is a very nice guy; compassionate, emotional, and, as usually comes with that package, a bit irresponsible.  He has his issues--but he has no false pretense about them. He drinks from first thing in the morning and smokes like a chimney.  He would rather play with his daughter than be a ""dad"" with rules.  He steps up to the plate when he is forced to, (such as burying the family dog), but he is filled with sadness and emotion--for example, he can't tell his daughter that her dog is dead; he instead tells her (through tear filled eyes and choking voice) that the dog went off to Hollywood to become a big star--she had the looks, after all.  I do think that he quits seeing his wife for who she is--he becomes more about playing the good guy with his daughter and letting his wife be the ""heavy"".  It's a cycle that I think many parents get into.Michelle Williams (another great independent actress) plays Cindy, a girl who at first seems one thing but quickly becomes another.  She is complicated, with a sordid past, and the choices she has made play themselves out in not-so-pleasant ways, often leaving Dean paying the price.  They don't get into what in her past made her behave as she does, but they give definite details as to some of the scenes in her life that make her cold hearted.  She is a nurse, and she desperately wants her husband to become ""something bigger and better"".  (He doesn't understand what she's talking about, as he doesn't define bigger or better as what he does for a living, but rather in the love he surrounds himself with.)  She is angry, and gets angrier throughout the movie.  She stops seeing him as her husband and lover, and sees him as embarrassing and a disappointment.  She humors him, but her anger wins out.  Her drinking doesn't help, either.This movie is a yo-yo.  One minute it shows the present time, the next flashes back to their beginnings.  The artistic nature of the film leaves you unable to walk away, yet you hate to see what you know is the probable outcome.  You don't want the hurt to happen, but you can't stop watching--like a train wreck.  It is alternately intimate and then intense, loving and hating, caring and apathetic.They do magnificent jobs portraying their characters.  You don't question for a minute who they are or where they are coming from.  You feel what they feel.  You see what they see.  Mostly, I think the movie is given from Dean's viewpoint (perhaps because he is more open, perhaps it is for some artistic reason--or perhaps it is only because I identified with his character).Many of these scenes are acted out in real day-to-day life, in every relationship.  Friends, lovers, marriage or other long-term partners...we all go through these things.  At the end of this movie, it asks YOU, the viewer, ""Is this you?""  I believe that we could all use that bit of self-reflection.  Could it be me?  Could it be us?  What can I do to not get to where these two are?This movie left me exhausted.  It is so raw, so real...and deeply sad.I do recommend it, though.

But is their responsibility to her and the vows they said to one another enough?Their beginning moments are portrayed with the sweet innocence of new love coupled with the ecstasies of early lust.

Worn down and burdened, Dean and Cindy seem scarcely able to put one foot in front of another.In a last ditch attempt to salvage what they have and regain something they've lost, they go away alone, leaving their daughter with her grandparents.Michelle Williams and Ryan Gosling are wonderfully realistic in their portrayals of Cindy and Dean.

In fact, if you are in a relationship that is not on the most solid of groundings, you may want to consider if this movie should be seen at this time. Along with scene stealing performances by both Ryan and Michelle, they are also the Executive Producers. Michelle really took chances in a role that is raw and affecting. Ryan is his normally stunning self. He blends vunerability and sexuality with aging in a near seamless performance.It has all the charm of a love story for a brief moment before havoc sets in and the reality of the challenges of life and love settle in.Two movies this holiday season, ""Blue Valentine"" and ""The Rabbit Hole"" penetrate the sanctity of marriage in ways rarely seen on screen. In fact, you would be hard pressed to decide which actors gave the best performances because they are equally compelling.If the last 25 minutes doesn't have you in tears, you may want to check your emotional compass because something is off. When Ryan's character says, ""You promised for better or worse, this is my worst"", your heart goes out to him. In that moment, you assess how important a vow marriage is, and you also can see that the future looks very bleak for this couple indeed. Michelle's role is a little more understated. But it reeks of honesty. When she reveals that she first had intercourse at 13 and has had 20-25 lovers at such a young age, you are both horrified and applauding for her realness.The use of flashbacks is quite clever and much easier to follow than you would have imagined.It isn't ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolf"" or ""Fatal Attraction"" or ""Eyes Wide Shut"".......but, it is arresting in its own way.",4,Kudos to Ms. Williams and Mr. Gosling for Riveting Performances,1294444800,"01 8, 2011",2011,1748,"['Just', 'saw', 'Blue', 'Valentine', 'well', 'hype', 'wait', 'would', 'not', 'call', 'date', 'movie', 'fact', 'are', 'relationship', 'not', 'most', 'solid', 'groundings', 'may', 'want', 'consider', 'movie', 'should', 'be', 'seen', 'time', 'scene', 'stealing', 'performances', 'Ryan', 'Michelle', 'are', 'also', 'Executive', 'Producers', 'Michelle', 'really', 'took', 'chances', 'role', 'raw', 'affecting', 'Ryan', 'normally', 'stunning', 'self', 'vunerability', 'sexuality', 'aging', 'near', 'seamless', 'performance.It', 'charm', 'love', 'story', 'brief', 'moment', 'havoc', 'sets', 'reality', 'challenges', 'life', 'love', 'settle', 'in.Two', 'movies', 'holiday', 'season', 'Blue', 'Valentine', 'Rabbit', 'Hole', 'penetrate', 'sanctity', 'marriage', 'ways', 'rarely', 'seen', 'screen', 'fact', 'would', 'be', 'hard', 'pressed', 'decide', 'actors', 'gave', 'best', 'performances', 'are', 'equally', 'compelling.If', 'last', '25', 'minutes', ""n't"", 'have', 'tears', 'may', 'want', 'check', 'emotional', 'compass', 'something', 'off', 'When', 'Ryan', 'character', 'promised', 'better', 'worse', 'worst', 'heart', 'out', 'moment', 'assess', 'how', 'important', 'vow', 'marriage', 'also', 'can', 'see', 'future', 'very', 'bleak', 'couple', 'indeed', 'Michelle', 'role', 'little', 'more', 'understated', 'honesty', 'When', 'first', 'had', 'intercourse', '13', 'had', '20-25', 'lovers', 'young', 'age', 'are', 'horrified', 'applauding', 'realness.The', 'use', 'flashbacks', 'quite', 'clever', 'much', 'easier', 'follow', 'would', 'have', 'imagined.It', ""n't"", 'Who', 'Afraid', 'Virginia', 'Wolf', 'Fatal', 'Attraction', 'Eyes', 'Wide', 'Shut', '.but', 'arresting', 'own', 'way']",N/A

1329091,A5GIYITYJPWN1,B0036TGTDE,"L P ""lilip""","[54, 77]","I doubt that this movie will do much for most people. It is drawn out, windy and stagnant. Yes, the critics are correct in their assessment: it was well crafted, well written and greatly acted - the characters were believable, multidimensional, and understood their parts intimately; it was a technically great movie, adhering beautifully to meter, rhyme and figure of speech - as Dr. J. Evans Pritchard, Ph.D. from ""Dead Poet's Society"" in his book ""Understanding Poetry"" would say. But the movie left sort of a blah aftertaste in my mouth. I think that's the case because it doesnt really have a plot or moves along, or even carries some kind of a meaningful message that would make up for its otherwise overly dramatic, whiny tone. For two hours you sit through this movie and really dont understand what the bottom line is; what the commotion is all about and what these characters actually want.""Blue Valentine"" is a micro-dissection of a failing marriage that is filled with a lot of pain, tears and melodrama, which at some point felt exaggerated because the characters never express any other emotions. They are sad and gloomy ALL THE TIME and no one knows why it has to be so darn difficult. The movie follows Dean (Ryan Gosling) and Cindy (Michelle Williams) falling in and out of love over a short period of courtship and childbirth, flashing back and forth from present to when they met.While the illogical nature of love is one of my favorite topics, here it feels pointless on the screen. Many weighty elements dont seem to be meditated on by the filmmaker, and one of the question that inevitably arises is Why are they Fighting? o ok, these two people got married young for the wrong reasons and now it is not working out for one of them. Why is that such a big deal and the end of the world and grounds for so much drama and gut-wrenching pain? It is not like they were the greatest, most profound lovers, so why should we care? After two hours of tedious back and forth, tears and drama, you still can't see point.The folly with ""Blue Valentine"" is that it never answers the most important question: Why? Why are these people fighting and why did they fall in love? Have they simply grown apart? Did Cindy finally realize she married him to get out of the house and not because she was in love with him? Or maybe they're just insufferable people who have no business trying to love another person.  None of these questions are really answered or even eluded to really. It just shows you they are sad and suffering, and sad and suffering. Sure you can make intuitive guesses as to the source of the conflict, of growing apart, of the alienation, but there is no evidence for it in the story. There is just a severe disconnect between the flashbacks of a supposedly happier time between the two lovers and the dreary present. In fact, one cannot even see the love between Cindy and Dean that supposedly existed in the beginning.This movie would have us believe that there existed some kind of a truly passionate, loving relationship between the two which, in turn, is making their separation from one another even more painful.But the reality looked different. No passion, love and sincere feelings between the two. All throughout the movie I kept wondering what one saw in the other and why anyone would think that they really loved each other as clearly Cindy didnt love Dean. In fact, she is selfish, cold and unlikable and throughout the movie she seems kind of insincere toward Dean; like she was merely putting up with him and their child until the life she really wanted came along.The two time periods shown in the film seem drastically far apart. There aren't any scenes of the genesis of their relationship that point to the present turmoil, connecting the two disparate worlds. How, why, did they change so much and why did they fall in love in the first place? It's crucial to good storytelling that there's some explanation of what went wrong or the motives and driving forces behind the characters' actions -- and if not, it at least should be made clear that this is a story about how - in spite of no specific reason - sometimes these things happen.These people got together for the same reason millions of other young people get together: boredom, the need for companionship, destitution or a desire to ""get out of your parents' house"" under the belief that married live somehow holds the secret to happiness. Cindy and Dean are one of those people. They arent special, they didnt have a great love, nothing earth shaking that would make it to the ""biggest love stories of all time"" happened.If crucial narrative pivots are left too open-ended, a story is destined to lose its voice. While Gosling and Williams inhabit their roles fully, one quickly realizes that the failure to connect leads to the audience feeling lost, unable to empathize or fully understand why any of this is happening or why the characters are behaving the way they do.I must also mention that Goseling was miscast He is being made to act and behave older than he can pull off and that beard of his looked like one of those glued on beards in school plays. Michelle Williams' character was not very likable and in fact so selfish that it was hard to sympathize with her from the beginning - which is not the movie's intention obviously. If a character portrayal evokes the exact opposite feeling in the audience than originally intended, you know something is off.In summary, while well crafted, this movie did feel like slowly pulling hairs for no apparent reason. They stretched out a simple story and artificially created an elaborate drama for two hours over a subject that could have been resolved in twenty minutes of film time. In the end this movie was just as pointless as Dean's and Cindy's courtship, and eventual marriage.",2,Like Digging in Your Flesh to Remove a Splinter for Two Hours and Never Getting It

We witness a couple floating in bliss in the early stages of their relationship and wallowing in desperate frustration later in a marriage hanging on by a thread. To say too much would deprive you of the pleasure of discovering the character arcs and events that adversely affect the marriage. What I will say is that Gosling and Williams make the pain of the characters palpable. The structuring of the film with its chronological bouncing may be off-putting to some, but I found it effective. In fact, upon a 2nd viewing, I better understood the thoughts and moods lying beneath the surfaces of the characters.

This is a relationship based on fleeting lust and then a shotgun marriage, and it's not even necessarily his baby, so why did anyone have any expectations they would ever make it? She had a dream of being a doctor; he was content with achieving very little in his life, and each wanted the other to change. There was never any big love story here, so why does anyone feel bad when it ends? It is pretty dreary and tedious.This is true love, people: accepting the other person as they are, liking them for what they are, and helping them achieve what they dream, even if it is not your dream. This was not that love story.Sex scenes were not more than you've seen elsewhere, so if you were thinking of renting it for just that, don't bother.

In an attempt to salvage the relationship, they spend a night away from their daughter in a motel, but things do not go as well as they had hoped.Simultaneous with this bleak look at their present lives, we visit the beginnings of Dean and Cindy's romance, a time filled with music, dance and all the other silly stuff that people do when they are falling in love.And, then we try to answer the question, what happened to make that all change?When it comes to showing the disintegration of a marriage, I don't think it was done any better than the breakfast montage in Orson Welles' CITIZEN KANE.  That sequence was about two minutes in length and it really said everything you needed to know about why the relationship failed.In BLUE VALENTINE, director Derek Cianfrance and his co-writers attempt to dig deeper into the reason(s) that love dies and people who have committed their lives to each other part.He has come up with an excellent, albeit depressing, script that often rings true, and he has elicited superb performances from his actors.  Ms. Williams, in fact, received a Best Actress Oscar nomination for her role.On the other hand, despite the emotional grittiness of the piece, the ultimate answer that Cianfrance presents us with is nothing that we haven't heard before: ""People change.  They grow apart.""As we learn about halfway through the picture, as much as they were in love at the time, Dean and Cindy probably married for the wrong reasons.  Yet, when they finally part, one can't help but think that this union, with some counseling, could have been saved.Based on his background (i.e. his parents divorced), I can certainly understand why Cianfrance would want to write/direct this film and, because they are great roles, I can understand  why fine actors like Gosling and Williams would want to play them.What I can't understand is, as well-made as the picture is, why somebody seeking to be ""entertained"" would want to see it.

Derek Cianfrance's ""Blue Valentine"" is all the more heartbreaking for portraying a working-class couple whose love is destroyed by continuing, unremitting bad luck.Cianfrance doesn't give us all the details of how Dean (Ryan Gosling) and Cindy (Michelle Williams) fall out of love; he tells the story in non-linear fashion, contrasting the couple's bitter present with their (relatively) sweet past. He dares to juxtapose the moment in Dean and Cindy's past when they fall in love--she does a softshoe to his ukulele version of ""You Always Hurt the One You Love""--with the exact moment in the present when they fall out of love, a joyless encounter in an ""adult motel"" that Dean thought would respark the passion in their marriage. (""Blue Valentine"" barely escaped a dreaded NC-17 rating.)Gosling and Williams give two of the most powerful, emnotionally naked performances you will ever see, and ""Blue Valentine""--though not exactly a pleasurable film--will leave you shaken and deeply moved.

Open the door!'

On one hand it was a pretty gritty, realistic look at how marriages can start off strong and crumble by the end and they aren't always so easy to walk away from because of so much shared history together.

It made us kind of check out to any emotional attachment to the characters.  The same intent and message could have been conveyed without taking it to that level where you were pretty much watching a porn. It was ridiculously slanted too...Gosling barely had any nudity where Williams showed pretty much everything and repeatedly. I think her nipples got more screen time than her eyes did.

1329111,A7DAL9PK7F4M1,B0036TGTDE,Paul Donovan,"[0, 0]","Nine Things about the Movie &#8220;Blue Valentine&#8221; [USA, 2010]1. This movie is a brave portrayal of the last part of a relationship, when &#8220;Happily Ever After&#8221; turns out to be false.2. It was written and directed by Derek Cianfrance. It stars Ryan Gosling and Michelle Williams. Three years after this move was made, Gosling and Cianfrance paired up again for &#8220;The Place Beyond the Pines&#8221;.3. The movie moves back and forth between two times: The first is the &#8220;love at first sight&#8221; period when they genuinely believe they will be together forever. The second is the disintegration period some five years later, when they realize &#8220;for better or worse&#8221; is not what they expected.. The genius here is that eventually you realize you are sometimes seeing almost the same scene being depicted in each period...but with different circumstances.4. Gosling and Williams have a genuine, believable chemistry. You believe that they are in love, and you believe the bitterness that grows between them. They should have won some kind of acting award for their performances.5. To make it more realistic, Gosling and Williams acted like a couple before filming the downhill slide. They rented a house together, and lived according to their characters&#8217; budgets.6. In some of the scenes, Gosling and Williams went without scripted dialogue; they improvised it as they were being filmed.7. The power of the movie comes not only from the big arguments the couple has, but the small moments, too: the ignored caress, the eyes that hide the truth, the awkward silences.8. At first, the film got an NC-17 rating, for it&#8217;s depiction of Michelle Williams receiving oral sex. The rating was appealed, and Gosling accused the ratings board of sexism and misogyny, noting that plenty of movies depict males receiving oral sex, and it&#8217;s not considered a big deal. The rating was changed to R.9. None of the relationships in the movie are happy, not even the long-lasting ones. Everyone is dealing with the death of love in some form or another. Well, unless they are admitting that they never felt it in the first place.",5,"When ""happily ever after"" doesn't actually happen",1402531200,"06 12, 2014",2014,2163,"['Nine', 'Things', 'Movie', '8220', 'Blue', 'Valentine', '8221', '[', 'USA', '2010', ']', '1', 'movie', 'brave', 'portrayal', 'last', 'part', 'relationship', 'when', '8220', 'Happily', 'Ever', '8221', 'out', 'be', 'false.2', 'was', 'written', 'directed', 'Derek', 'Cianfrance', 'Ryan', 'Gosling', 'Michelle', 'Williams', 'Three', 'years', 'move', 'was', 'made', 'Gosling', 'Cianfrance', 'paired', 'up', 'again', '8220', 'Place', 'Beyond', 'Pines', '8221', '.3', 'movie', 'back', 'forth', 'two', 'times', 'first', '8220', 'love', 'first', 'sight', '8221', 'period', 'when', 'genuinely', 'believe', 'will', 'be', 'together', 'forever', 'second', 'disintegration', 'period', 'five', 'years', 'later', 'when', 'realize', '8220', 'better', 'worse', '8221', 'not', 'what', 'expected..', 'genius', 'here', 'eventually', 'realize', 'are', 'sometimes', 'seeing', 'almost', 'same', 'scene', 'being', 'depicted', 'period', 'different', 'circumstances.4', 'Gosling', 'Williams', 'have', 'genuine', 'believable', 'chemistry', 'believe', 'are', 'love', 'believe', 'bitterness', 'should', 'have', 'won', 'kind', 'acting', 'award', 'performances.5', 'make', 'more', 'realistic', 'Gosling', 'Williams', 'acted', 'couple', 'filming', 'downhill', 'slide', 'rented', 'house', 'together', 'lived', 'according', 'characters', '8217', 'budgets.6', 'scenes', 'Gosling', 'Williams', 'went', 'scripted', 'dialogue', 'improvised', 'were', 'being', 'filmed.7', 'power', 'movie', 'not', 'only', 'big', 'arguments', 'couple', 'small', 'moments', 'too', 'ignored', 'caress', 'eyes', 'hide', 'truth', 'awkward', 'silences.8', 'first', 'film', 'got', 'NC-17', 'rating', '8217', 's', 'depiction', 'Michelle', 'Williams', 'receiving', 'oral', 'sex', 'rating', 'was', 'appealed', 'Gosling', 'accused', 'ratings', 'board', 'sexism', 'misogyny', 'noting', 'plenty', 'movies', 'depict', 'males', 'receiving', 'oral', 'sex', '8217', 'not', 'considered', 'big', 'deal', 'rating', 'was', 'changed', 'R.9', 'None', 'relationships', 'movie', 'are', 'happy', 'not', 'even', 'long-lasting', 'ones', 'Everyone', 'dealing', 'death', 'love', 'form', 'Well', 'are', 'admitting', 'never', 'felt', 'first', 'place']",N/A
1329112,A1NUDHU6HSLVEY,B0036TGTDE,Peazfool,"[10, 12]","I just finished watching this film and decided to jot some thoughts down into words. Lots of spoilers - don't read if you haven't seen the film-There were some parts of that movie that really touched home - like the part where he meets the family and says to her, ""I'm not good enough for you"" and she's like, ""stop you're hurting my feelings."" Then the part where he's trying to cheering her up because he's finally spending a weekend with his wife, and all she's trying to do is make him a better man by asking him what his hopes and dreams are, and the two conflicting intentions consistently building a tension so palpable you could almost feel it through the screen.When they were in love it was as if the world opened up to them, and even when she'd fallen out of love with him, there were still glimpses of caring and affection. The part where they looked for his ring in the bushes together, or when he punched that smug doctor in the face.The part where he asked her to have a baby with him, and she shut him down - it's crazy how he tries to save the marriage and imagines a life where it's so simple and lovey dovey. It's not that he's not complex, it's that he has actually figured out some of the finer things in life, figured out what's important - family, and love. But she's much more complex than that and the audience only got a glimpse of it. Their pasts speak volumes as to who they are as characters - he comes from a simple family and does a simple job, and she comes from a history of complexity and needs that in order to thrive.I can't help but ask Ryan's character, ""How do you recover from a situation like that?"" From a broken marriage with a child who's not yours, when you try and try and everything seems to fail. When you come in as the white in shining armor, and leave depleted, waking away from the only love that you ever knew. Like a silhouette of memories just walking away.The part where the kid chases after Dean and tries to pull his arm back, almost like she intuitively knew that this might been the end - that part killed me.Why is Michelle so good at portraying these tragic tragic complex characters? I don't get it. She was great in this movie, and now nominated for an Oscar for her role in Marilyn. She has got to be one of the most typcasted ""sensual""  characters in history.Ryan Gosling delivers a very good performance. The dynamic between his outer strength and inner weaknesses has to be noted. He has childlike qualities about him that brings out his charm, his confidence exhumed at first when he first met her but eventually faded as his love for her and her consistent rejection chewed away at his ego. He really just needed a good friend to tell him ""hey back the f off, she cares about you but you gotta let her breathe, you're suffocating her."" He needed someone to tell him ""Hey she's following through with her dreams, she wants that for you too, she doesn't want a husband who wastes away at a mindless job when he's capable of ten times more.""In the end he asks, ""what will it take?

1329113,AQ2UN38CMK119,B0036TGTDE,P. Mann,"[0, 0]","The first time I watched ""Blue Valentine"" (or tried to), I didn't finish it. It simply did not hold my interest. So I put the movie aside, didn't think it fair to review a film I hadn't watched through, and pretty much forgot about it. Then, the other day, I saw the DVD and thought I'd give it another try. I won't repeat the plot as it's been summarized quite adequately in other reviews. I'll just share my reactions.I was quite impressed by the performances of the leads, Ryan Gosling and Michelle Williams. I know that Williams received the Oscar nomination, but I thought Gosling's performance truly amazing. He's nuanced when necessary and over the top when the script calls for that. In a film that jumps around in its structure, I thought both actors played their parts letter perfect. (I'm not really sure why this point impresses me so much. After all, even the most linear films are typically shot completely out of order, so actors are always called upon to act out of order.) I also had to admire the crafting of the director, Derek Cianfrance, and the writers, Cianfrance, Joey Curtis, and Cami Delavigne. ""Blue Valentine"" is clearly a carefully put-together film and shows both planning and intelligence in its structure.The problem, though, is that I didn't want to be admiring performances, direction, or writing. I wanted to be more involved in the plot and the characters. And, unfortunately, I simply wasn't all that sucked in. By no means did I find the film boring or unpleasant to watch, but seeing it wasn't the all-enveloping experience that the best films offer.

1329114,A39IY0JU5JI69G,B0036TGTDE,"Promise ""promise""","[1, 1]","I almost gave this five stars just for the performances but, after reading a number of other reviews, I realize that there were problems with the script that made me subtract a star.In the ""Special Features"" on the DVD, the writer/director states that he made this film, which is truly a highly personal labor of love, to come to grips with the pain he felt at ten years when his own parents divorced.  Maybe he should have written about those real people because the two characters he wrote in this script are not convincing.  He invented two characters, each from unhappy homes who marry too early for the wrong reasons and who are doomed to fail at marriage.  But the actors he has hired for the jobs are so beautiful and likeable that we really want them to make it.If he had just dropped his personal agenda of making a film about a doomed marriage, and let his characters have their way, this might have been a much more plausible story.  These two, as brought to life by Williams and Gosling, might just have found a way to make their relationship work.  The part of the film that shows their falling in love is so charming and deeply moving that the second part which shows their breakup just leaves us devastated.  This isn't just a complaint because it lacks a traditional Hollywood Happy Ending....it's an ending that doesn't make sense out of what the film has shown us.That said, there is a lot in the film to love.  The acting is wonderful.  Michelle Williams plays vulnerable better than almost any actress I can think of.  Ryan Gosling is amazing!  I had never seen him in any other films and I was blown away by his performance here.  There are some deleted scenes on the DVD, mostly of the two in their early, romantic period, that are priceless.  They rival the best of the Diane Keaton/Woody Allen scenes from ""Annie Hall.""The film reminded me of the films of John Cassavetes, which were largely improvisational and achieved the same deeply authentic and moving performances.  I think that if the director had stepped aside and let a writer who was less invested in the story re-write the script, a truly memorable film could have been made.  Still, if you don't care a lot about the actual story, it's worth watching just for the many touching and realistic moments.",4,Worth watching for the performances,1334966400,"04 21, 2012",2012,2287,"['almost', 'gave', 'five', 'stars', 'just', 'performances', 'reading', 'number', 'other', 'reviews', 'realize', 'were', 'problems', 'script', 'made', 'subtract', 'star.In', 'Special', 'Features', 'DVD', 'writer/director', 'made', 'film', 'truly', 'highly', 'personal', 'labor', 'love', 'come', 'grips', 'pain', 'felt', 'ten', 'years', 'when', 'own', 'parents', 'divorced', 'Maybe', 'should', 'have', 'written', 'real', 'people', 'two', 'characters', 'wrote', 'script', 'are', 'not', 'convincing', 'invented', 'two', 'characters', 'unhappy', 'homes', 'who', 'marry', 'too', 'early', 'wrong', 'reasons', 'who', 'are', 'doomed', 'fail', 'marriage', 'actors', 'hired', 'jobs', 'are', 'so', 'beautiful', 'likeable', 'really', 'want', 'make', 'it.If', 'had', 'just', 'dropped', 'personal', 'agenda', 'making', 'film', 'doomed', 'marriage', 'let', 'characters', 'have', 'way', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'more', 'plausible', 'story', 'two', 'brought', 'life', 'Williams', 'Gosling', 'might', 'just', 'have', 'found', 'way', 'make', 'relationship', 'work', 'part', 'film', 'falling', 'love', 'so', 'charming', 'deeply', 'moving', 'second', 'part', 'breakup', 'just', 'devastated', ""n't"", 'just', 'complaint', 'traditional', 'Hollywood', 'Happy', 'Ending', '.it', 'ending', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'what', 'film', 'shown', 'us.That', 'said', 'lot', 'film', 'love', 'acting', 'wonderful', 'Michelle', 'Williams', 'vulnerable', 'better', 'almost', 'actress', 'can', 'think', 'Ryan', 'Gosling', 'amazing', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'other', 'films', 'was', 'blown', 'away', 'performance', 'here', 'are', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'DVD', 'mostly', 'two', 'early', 'romantic', 'period', 'are', 'priceless', 'rival', 'best', 'Diane', 'Keaton/Woody', 'Allen', 'scenes', 'Annie', 'Hall', 'film', 'reminded', 'films', 'John', 'Cassavetes', 'were', 'largely', 'improvisational', 'achieved', 'same', 'deeply', 'authentic', 'moving', 'performances', 'think', 'director', 'had', 'stepped', 'aside', 'let', 'writer', 'who', 'was', 'less', 'invested', 'story', 're-write', 'script', 'truly', 'memorable', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'Still', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'lot', 'actual', 'story', 'worth', 'watching', 'just', 'many', 'touching', 'realistic', 'moments']",N/A

Michelle  plays a girl (Cindy), nursing student with ambitions to go to medical school.  She is attractive and smart, comes from the middle class family and has affinity for kinky sex.  Ryan (Dean) portrays a young man who is a high school drop out and works for the moving company.  Through the set of circumstances, this unlikely pair finds their way together.  Their inital attraction is genuine and generosity and kindness of the young man is sincere and unconditional.  So is his love for the girl of his dreams.  As it usually happens in relationships, there is always one person that loves the other one more and in this case is it Dean that loves his girl more.  However good his intentions are, his drinking, lack of ambition and desire to improve his circumstances and circumstances of his new family are taking a toll on relationship.  Cindy, once carefree is suddently looking worn out and exhausted from being a mother, wife and a part time student.  Before our eyes we see their love story and marriage unravel and it is easy to relate to their loss at some point.  The end is not surprising but it is a plot that helps bring the movie to its reality in its conclusion.Plot, performances and music in the film are great.

Although filled with reality, the trouble I had is that the film lacked a fuller concept of intimacy other than sex and potential infidelity; it is why the marriage failed and the movie received three stars instead of five with me. The tragedy in the film is Cindy. She doesn't see how men still view her as a whore such as the doctor and their fighting relationship doesn't go anywhere other than, ""I don't feel anymore for you,"" ""I'm done!"" ""I'm dried up for you anymore."" This is very realistic hence her nitpicking of Dean whom she wants to be like the doctor whom will eventually just use her. The film doesn't demonstrate the whys. The film with the stellar cast could have gone deeper and developed more than what is really established, which I feel is the tragedy of relationships this day and age when the relationship is based only on sex and doesn't develop the historical problems and content that eventually led to a disconnect in bedroom; it is a result of their pasts, neglect, immaturity, loss of tenderness and mature growth. It doesn't develop why it happened only that it did, which is indicative of many divorces hence why ""Pete and Repeat"" remarriages. I feel the actor and actress did a fine job with what was written and the little girl is adorable.

1329118,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B0036TGTDE,RMurray847,"[67, 78]","BLUE VALENTINE is a low budget film, telling us about the beginning and end of a marriage.  It stars Ryan Gosling & Michelle Williams.  The movie shows us ""now"" over the space of just a couple of days, as we see this couple along with their roughly 5 year old child, going through mundane tasks and the final arguments that lead to their split.  The film also bounces back to the few weeks or months from their first meeting until the day they get married.  We see them about 5 or 6 years younger, nave & sweetly in-love.  When we bounce to the present, we seem them harried, worried and barely able to tolerate each other.Some would say that the film makes a broad statement on how love or marriage can go from sweet to sour.  How we sabotage our happiness.  How difficult it is to make a happy marriage (or for the true cynics, how IMPOSSIBLE it is).I took NO global message from the film.  It is powerful, but it is very small in scope.  This is because the filmmaker Derek Cianfrance has made a deeply SPECIFIC movie.  Gosling & Williams give VERY lived-in performances where we very much feel we are looking at a very particular couple going through very particular joys and disappointments.  We feel like we're getting a very intimate peek into what makes this particular couple tick.  Thus, it becomes nearly impossible to extrapolate the film to the general subject of ""marriage.""  This is not a failing, per se...but I've certainly read comments on the film that imply that very thing.  That is absurd, quite frankly.  Each marriage has its own rhythms, pulses, occurrences & secrets.  The relationship depicted here feels real, because it is so specific.  It also feels small.To me, the main reason to see this film is for the performances.  Both stars do their best work here...by a long way.  Williams has given some nice performances in the past (BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN, WENDY & LUCY)...but often her performances have been of women more or less drained by life.  Williams, particularly in the early scenes, is full of undirected ambition and spirit.  She's eager to get away from her terrible homelife and is smart enough to have career ambitions, even though this is not something that runs in her family.  She's very close to her grandmother, but terrorized by her parents, who have vicious arguments that she must endure.  She makes lousy choices in men.  Gosling is new to the big city (NYC) and nave.  He's poorly educated, and not terribly ambitious.  He's not seen anything for himself other than getting away from his own sad family situation.  He's a terribly nice guy (his early scene with a senior citizen he doesn't even know is touching, heartbreaking and puts us forever on his side)...but has little to offer other than devoted, puppy-dog love.  The two have a passionate and convincing early romance...but when they take the step to marriage, we also see that from the first day, the seeds of end of the marriage have already been planted.  I won't give specifics...but let's just say that not enough of their paths are converging for this thing to really have a shot.  For them, marriage is an escape from demons...and we see they are bringing some of the demons right along with them.In the later scenes, as they fight and old bitterness comes out...we are able to pretty much guess just how the five years since the wedding day have gone by.  Gosling has spent his time in menial jobs, showing no inclination to move up.  Williams, because she now has a family, has put her ambitions on the back burner.  She's a nurse, but she's also by far the primary breadwinner.  The two seem to have a comfortable lower middle-class life...but their paths have diverged (Gosling is barely even on a path.)I suspect the film wants us to feel good and bad for each of them in equal measure.  To not take sides...but to simply feel bad for both and to wish they could find a way to get it together.  However, my experience and that of my wife, was that we very much took sides (both with the same person)...and this somewhat diminishes the power of the film.  It's not meant to be a good vs. bad movie...but it sort of ends up that way.This is not a happy film...but there's plenty of wry humor.  (And if you've heard about the graphic sex that initially got this film an NC-17...you'll likely scratch your head at that.  The sex in BLACK SWAN was far more ""shocking."")  It's also not as depressing as perhaps you've heard.  Again, because we're watching a film that ISN'T about our own marriage.  Our marriage is very different.  We see this couple and feel for them...but we don't sit there and think, ""OMG, this is SO much like my marriage.""  (Thank goodness.)  Granted, this is a very personal response from me...others may feel differently.You should absolutely see the film, though.  It features two of the very best American performances this year.  And despite seeming like we're just watching home movies, it is actually very artfully photographed.  And as a bonus, it features the most outrageous cheap hotel room in film history.  (Don't ask...just see for yourself.)",4,4.5 stars for one of the best acted films of the year,1295222400,"01 17, 2011",2011,5093,"['BLUE', 'VALENTINE', 'low', 'budget', 'film', 'telling', 'beginning',

At the end Ryan Gosling's character walks away and the daugther he has been raising runs to him begging him not to leave.  If that scene does not break your heart, you have no heart.  As he walks away you know he is walking to a life of lonliness, and solitude.  Everything he ever loved or cherished is gone.  I have heard many negative things about Michelle Williams' character - not the way she played her, which was great - but the character.  That she was cold, and manipulative and treated her husband badly.  Those who say that have no idea the emotional toll a loveless relationship takes.  She did what she did becuase she had to.  She is a brave character.  The saddest part of this movie is its unflinching portrayal of what happens when love between two people dies.  There is no worse feeling in the world.

1329121,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B0036TGTDE,Roland E. Zwick,"[2, 4]","Set in a rural, working-class area of Pennsylvania, Derek Cianfrance's ""Blue Valentine"" provides us with the anatomy of an unhappy marriage.Like Stanley Donen's far more scintillating 1967 film ""Two for the Road,"" ""Blue Valentine"" takes us back and forth to various stages in the couple's relationship.  We see them in the present day as Dean (Ryan Gosling) and Cindy (Michelle Williams) struggle to hold it together, growing increasingly distant from one another both emotionally and romantically.  We also see, in counterpoint, the earlier stages of their courtship, when their love was new and exciting and the future filled with infinite possibility and hope.  This non-linear narrative structure serves only to underline and intensify the sadness of the present day.Perhaps the most audacious - and, for some viewers, no doubt, frustrating - aspect of the film is the characters' reluctance to articulate their thoughts and feelings about their relationship.  We sense that they are angry, irritated and disappointed with their lives and each other, but we're rarely told why, although Dean's alcoholism appears to be a key factor in the couple's disintegration.  The root of the problem appears to be a general state of ennui that afflicts many, if not most, couples after they've spent a certain amount of time together.  Thus, ""Blue Valentine"" becomes an almost impressionistic look at a crumbling relationship, comprised of the little day-to-day moments and activities that, when added together, create a fully developed picture.  Moreover, there is one beautifully executed, harrowing sequence in which a drunken Dean confronts Cindy at the hospital where she works that is a model of naturalistic filmmaking.Yet, the movie's greatest strength also happens to be its greatest weakness.  For there are  times when the film seems to want us to congratulate it for saying something incisive and profound when it really isn't saying anything at all.Still, Gosling and Williams have probably never been better than they are here, as they tackle their roles with absolute realism and conviction.  Moreover, an eclectic score (by Grizzly Bear) that often plays against the mood of the scene and a bravely inconclusive ending counterbalance the movie's occasional lack of articulation and insight.",4,Impressionistic look at a crumbling relationship,1306886400,"06 1, 2011",2011,2299,"['Set', 'rural', 'working-class', 'area', 'Pennsylvania', 'Derek', 'Cianfrance', 'Blue', 'Valentine', 'anatomy', 'unhappy', 'marriage.Like', 'Stanley', 'Donen', 'far', 'more', 'scintillating', '1967', 'film', 'Two', 'Road', 'Blue', 'Valentine', 'back', 'forth', 'various', 'stages', 'couple', 'relationship', 'see', 'present', 'day', 'Dean', 'Ryan', 'Gosling', 'Cindy', 'Michelle', 'Williams', 'struggle', 'hold', 'together', 'growing', 'increasingly', 'distant', 'one', 'emotionally', 'romantically', 'also', 'see', 'counterpoint', 'earlier', 'stages', 'courtship', 'when', 'love', 'was', 'new', 'exciting', 'future', 'filled', 'infinite', 'possibility', 'hope', 'non-linear', 'narrative', 'structure', 'only', 'underline', 'intensify', 'sadness', 'present', 'most', 'audacious', 'viewers', 'doubt', 'frustrating', 'aspect', 'film', 'characters', 'reluctance', 'articulate', 'thoughts', 'feelings', 'relationship', 'sense', 'are', 'angry', 'irritated', 'disappointed', 'lives', 'other', ""'re"", 'rarely', 'told', 'why', 'Dean', 'alcoholism', 'be', 'key', 'factor', 'couple', 'disintegration', 'root', 'problem', 'be', 'general', 'state', 'ennui', 'many', 'not', 'most', 'couples', ""'ve"", 'spent', 'certain', 'amount', 'time', 'together', 'Thus', 'Blue', 'Valentine', 'almost', 'impressionistic', 'look', 'crumbling', 'relationship', 'comprised', 'little', 'day-to-day', 'moments', 'activities', 'when', 'added', 'together', 'create', 'fully', 'developed', 'picture', 'Moreover', 'one', 'beautifully', 'executed', 'harrowing', 'sequence', 'drunken', 'Dean', 'Cindy', 'hospital', 'where', 'model', 'naturalistic', 'filmmaking.Yet', 'movie', 'greatest', 'strength', 'also', 'be', 'greatest', 'weakness', 'are', 'times', 'when', 'film', 'want', 'congratulate', 'saying', 'something', 'incisive', 'profound', 'when', 'really', ""n't"", 'saying', 'anything', 'all.Still', 'Gosling', 'Williams', 'have', 'probably', 'never', 'been', 'better', 'are', 'here', 'tackle', 'roles', 'absolute', 'realism', 'conviction', 'Moreover', 'eclectic', 'score', 'Grizzly', 'Bear', 'often', 'mood', 'scene', 'bravely', 'inconclusive', 'ending', 'counterbalance', 'movie', 'occasional', 'lack', 'articulation', 'insight']",N/A

1329126,AWUUMER0F3WF4,B0036TGTDE,Sheryl Fechter,"[11, 13]","I've been reading so many other reviews, comments and postings of this movie and see people's responses are everywhere. I don't think with this movie that is odd whatsoever. It is opinion scattering. This story did not allow me to look away from the painful scenario of it. The plot is not too complicated; the condition of a love gone over to complete dysfunction. This is in no way a feel good movie ... not even close. Their situations are made to make you run through some intense emotions. I don't believe you are supposed to feel anywhere near hopeful for this agonizing, emotionally drained couple and for their circumstance when you are through with the movie. The entire mood of the film is dismal; not much lighting, the foreboding overcast days with rainy weather, moody night shots, the bored feel of their small town, the dilapidated look of the main characters home all pull a negative statement.Husband Dean, portrayed by Oscar nominated Ryan Gosling and his wife counterpart Cindy, portrayed by Oscar nominated (this picture)  Michelle Williams are wonderfully convincing together, and have a palpable onscreen chemistry.  Their younger years are shown to the audience through flashbacks. So many uncomfortable ones for me to learn a lot of information of their psychological pasts which explain so much of what is happening while the movie plays through to the present time. Starting here, in their younger lives, as they are so important and relevant to the whole demise of the marriage. I seemed to see quite a bit about these two at this point in time.Dean, who seemed the less complicated person to understand for me, was (and remained) hard working and took whatever menial job that he could get by with. I saw him as a pretty interactive person, social with his co-workers, laughing often and empathetic. In a wonderfully showing scene with an elderly gentleman (Walter) we are treated to just how caring he most certainly is. These nurturing qualities would be greatly needed in a future father.  One could easily see the extra time and special way he gave Walter dignity and pride while introducing him to his new living quarters, this happened to be where Cindy's beloved grandmother was staying for a time also. There really isn't too much background to look at as far as Dean personally except for his ability for putting the needs of others before himself. I could find several upsetting problems befalling Cindy in her upbringing. She, in sharp contrast to Dean, is not happy and quite cynical. She comes from an abusive family background from some very showing scenes which seemingly cause self-esteem issues. In her relationship with her high school boyfriend is the point where you should start seeing red flags. He mistreats her, is cruel with her feelings, and is downright abusive with her at times. Cindy has not had a relationship that is healthy, with the exception of her grandmother.  The two meet at the nursing home. Dean sees her from around Walter's new room and seems immediately smitten with her, this is how they begin. Aside from the normal infatuation stage, these two seem as if they have two completely different dispositions. One of the flashback recollections I thought pertinent was the joke that Cindy tells to Dean on the bus - it made me cringe. It sure didn't appear that Dean was comfortable with it whatsoever while she laughs about it. Did that joke make you laugh?To really appreciate this movie for what it is, one should always keep in mind how Cindy has been treated in her relationships during her lifetime which is arguably with an abusive element involved. Dean does not show any penchant for abuse at all and especially towards her. He does not understand her comfort with things being painful considering his nurturing capabilities.  With many things Cindy does it appears she does not have a whole lot of empathy. With Dean she is mostly cold and shut-off, then towards her daughter Frankie she can be neglectful of her safety and of her care at times.  This is easily shown at the breakfast time as the movie opens. She also forgets the recital while Dean sits fidgeting until virtually the end before Cindy runs in.During the scenes with Cindy and her father, there is a comfortable relationship between them even though he was a large part of her abusive upbringing.  Dean is left out or looked down on by the man as being an outcast in the family. He is Cindy's husband treated with so much disregard and disrespect at the tragic ending of the film, which is gut-wrenching between Frankie and her father.  I think in all this pain is how this film actually played truthfully. If not to bring out your strongest feelings towards the characters and their situations then why play certain things out during this heartbreaking unraveling of their family?  The characters all made me feel several different emotions; anger, a scant glimmer of nostalgia, fear, abandonment, loss, and a pervasive sadness that permeates this film. It basically infiltrated my own thoughts and influenced my state of mind for a long while after watching.So many have penned this movie as pointless. A movie such as this can push every button of feeling one has left until it's ending when you are exhausted. It's as if you have been through it yourself and you've only watched it play out through characters. May I reiterate; this is not a feel good movie and is not supposed to be. For myself, it is amazing for being an exhausting study of just the opposite.",5,I Watched This Demise Over And Over Before Writing ...

It alternates between scenes of a couple (played by Ryan Gosling and Michelle Williams) six years into their marriage, and flashbacks that tell the story of how they met and married.  You've probably seen couples like this, where every statement one partner makes seems to provoke a ""What's THAT supposed to mean?"" response from the other.  So if you'd like to watch that for a couple of hours, by all means see this movie.I am giving it 3 stars because the acting is good, the editing is really good, and the whole thing ""feels real"" (as I said earlier, you've probably seen couples like this).  I would quibble a bit with some of the blurbs I've seen about the film's brillance.  For example, that it is told in an ""innovative style.""  They're flashbacks, folks.

After an enormous battle with the MPAA to get the initial NC-17 rating overturned, the film opened to critical acclaim, yet was unmercifully snubbed at the Oscars this year. This is a shame, because this film features two of the best performances that you are likely to see all year, and it is also a raw, powerful experience that you will never forget.This film tells the story of Dean Pereira (Ryan Gosling) and Cindy Heller (Michelle Williams), a high school drop out and a medical student, who meet by chance in a nursing home. Dean is immediately love-struck with Cindy, and begins to pursue her from that point on. He eventually wins her over with his charm and musical talents, and the two become an item. As the relationship evolves, things get serious, and they eventually decide to get married.The film constantly shifts back and forth between time periods, from the initial stages of their relationship, to where they are presently. Dean is a borderline alcoholic who has given up on his dreams of being a musician in order to paint houses to make a living. Cindy is a nurse at a hospital, who constantly tries to deal with Dean's constant mood shifts and childlike behavior. Dean is a good father and husband, but he is clearly struggling with some serious demons. Cindy is a good mother, but the love that she has for her husband has taken on a note of ambiguity. Dean makes an ill-timed attempt to reconcile with his wife at a dingy motel, and it only serves to complicate matters even further. When he drunkenly stumbles in to her workplace, demanding an explanation for her seemingly frigid behavior, there is no doubt that this marriage is in serious jeopardy. The gritty details are laid out before us, and upon reflection, it is clear that things were headed this way from the very beginning.Michelle Williams and Ryan Gosling are fantastic in their roles. They tear up the screen, lay their emotions on the table, and rip our hearts out in the process. This is a reality check from director Derek Cianfrance, who gives the film a gritty look and feel that haunts you after the credits roll.  This is not your typical love story. This is the anti-Notebook - and you should not miss it.Blue Valentine is rated R, on appeal from a previous NC-17 rating, for strong graphic sexual content, language, and a beating. 112 minutes.

It is not an easy movie to watch and doesn't provide the typical Hollywood ending.  For that reason alone, the movie is a noteworthy commentary on relationships based on infatuation and little substance.Dean (Ryan Gosling) works for a Brooklyn moving company.  He first meets Cindy (Michelle Williams) when his company assigns him to relocate an elderly man to a Scranton nursing home on the same day she is visiting her sick grandmother there.  Dean is immediately smitten and later returns to Scranton to look for her.  He finds her and she falls for his lovesick charms, even though she has a boyfriend (Mitch Vogel).Cindy has ambitions.  She attends college, is a good student, and aspires to a career in medicine.  Dean is a high school dropout who thinks little about the future and is content with a life that offers him little chance of improvement.Director Derek Cianfrance provides a raw, non-glossy look at a relationship deteriorating before our eyes.  He gives the film a documentary feel as the dialogue reveals the pain of the two young people as they see that their union is not working.

1329135,A3NKKLHHSS1GNO,B0036TGTDE,ThirtyMinuteReviews,"[1, 1]","I am not sure that a modern love story could get more painfully dramatic or a fictional couple experience more tragic circumstances than Ryan Gosling and Michelle Williams in Blue Valentine.  This was a touching story, carefully pieced together and subtle.  A diamond in the rough, if you ask me.We see a couple.  To be blunt, they are white trash.  Ryan Gosling is losing his hair, smokes incessantly, and spends most of the day in a drunken stupor.  It is the only way he can make it through the torture of his menial painting job and underachiever lot in life.  Michelle Williams has likely put on a few pounds since high school, sports tacky fake nails, and doesn't do much to style her dishwater blonde hair.  She works as a hospital nurse but really wanted to go to med school.  The couple loves their young daughter.  Our first glimpses of the couple lead us to believe that they could be any lower-middle class couple struggling to pay the bills in America.  But there is more.The flashbacks begin.  We see how Gosling's character was a roustabout and a high school dropout.  Not knowing what to do, he joins a moving company in Brooklyn for a steady paycheck.  By chance, he meets Williams's character while moving a decrepit old man into an assisted living center.  Williams is caring for her ailing grandmother, who she clearly loves.  Gosling hits on Williams, but she is too young, shy, and struck to nibble back.Plus, Williams is in an unhappy relationship with an overpowering jock college student.  He treats her poorly, even sexually abusing her in one scene.  (She ends up pregnant from the encounter.)  This glimpse is foreshadowing of later scenes in which we learn more about Williams's character's sexual history and witness, to my recollection, the first on-screen abortion procedure.  This is real and painful stuff, folks.  Not graphic and gory, but it turns your stomach.  Not for the faint of heart.Williams and Gosling ultimately connect and fall in love.  One particularly affecting element of Blue Valentine is its sharp appreciation for how personal and magical love is.  It is inside jokes.  It is ""our song.""  It is is being unapologetically silly and not caring what anyone else thinks.  It is public displays of affection.  It is finding joy in the simple.  It has been a long time since I have seen a film that captures all of this so well.And then life seems to intercede for the couple.  Dreams go largely unrealized.  Potential is left on the shelf to expire.  The past shows its ugly head.  The present is awful and filled with suspicion, disappointment, and struggle.  The love that was once there is buried, maybe crushed by adulthood and responsibility.  The film does not end on a high note.We get great performances by Williams and Gosling.  The most impressive aspect is how they seamlessly transition from young and full of hope to slightly older and broken.  It is more than just altered appearance; it is a transformation that takes stamina and diving deep inside the role to ""get"" why the character has so much angst and sadness.I recommend this film.  As love stories go, this is probably one more for guys than gals.  It is not lighthearted, but you will learn something about life and love.",5,A love story for the guys.,1361491200,"02 22, 2013",2013,3243,"['am', 'not', 'sure', 'modern', 'love', 'story', 'could', 'get', 'more', 'painfully', 'dramatic', 'fictional', 'couple', 'experience', 'more', 'tragic', 'circumstances', 'Ryan', 'Gosling', 'Michelle', 'Williams', 'Blue', 'Valentine', 'was', 'touching', 'story', 'carefully', 'pieced', 'together', 'subtle', 'diamond', 'rough', 'ask', 'see', 'couple', 'be', 'blunt', 'are', 'white', 'trash', 'Ryan', 'Gosling', 'losing', 'hair', 'smokes', 'incessantly', 'most', 'day', 'drunken', 'stupor', 'only', 'way', 'can', 'make', 'torture', 'menial', 'painting', 'job', 'underachiever', 'lot', 'life', 'Michelle', 'Williams', 'likely', 'put', 'few', 'pounds', 'high', 'school', 'sports', 'tacky', 'fake', 'nails', ""n't"", 'do', 'much', 'style', 'dishwater', 'blonde', 'hair', 'hospital', 'nurse', 'really', 'wanted', 'go', 'med', 'school', 'couple', 'young', 'daughter', 'first', 'glimpses', 'couple', 'lead', 'believe', 'could', 'be', 'lower-middle', 'class', 'couple', 'struggling', 'pay', 'bills', 'America', 'more.The', 'flashbacks', 'begin', 'see', 'how', 'Gosling', 'character', 'was', 'roustabout', 'high', 'school', 'dropout', 'Not', 'knowing', 'what', 'do', 'moving', 'company', 'Brooklyn', 'steady', 'paycheck', 'chance', 'Williams', 'character', 'moving', 'decrepit', 'old', 'man', 'assisted', 'living', 'center', 'Williams', 'caring', 'ailing', 'grandmother', 'who', 'clearly', 'Gosling', 'hits', 'Williams', 'too', 'young', 'shy', 'struck', 'nibble', 'back.Plus', 'Williams', 'unhappy', 'relationship', 'overpowering', 'jock', 'college', 'student', 'poorly', 'even', 'sexually', 'abusing', 'one', 'scene', 'up', 'pregnant', 'encounter', 'glimpse', 'foreshadowing', 'later', 'scenes', 'learn', 'more', 'Williams', 'character', 'sexual', 'history', 'witness', 'recollection', 'first', 'on-screen', 'abortion', 'procedure', 'real', 'painful', 'stuff', 'folks', 'Not', 'graphic', 'gory', 'stomach', 'Not', 'faint', 'heart.Williams', 'Gosling', 'ultimately', 'connect', 'fall', 'love', 'One', 'particularly', 'affecting', 'element', 'Blue', 'Valentine', 'sharp', 'appreciation', 'how', 'personal', 'magical', 'love', 'inside', 'jokes', 'song', 'being', 'unapologetically', 'silly', 'not', 'caring', 'what', 'anyone', 'else', 'public', 'displays', 'affection', 'finding', 'joy', 'simple', 'been', 'long', 'time', 'have', 'seen', 'film', 'so', 'well.And', 'then', 'life', 'intercede', 'couple', 'Dreams', 'go', 'largely', 'unrealized', 'Potential', 'left', 'shelf', 'expire', 'past', 'ugly', 'head', 'present', 'awful', 'filled', 'suspicion', 'disappointment', 'struggle', 'love', 'was', 'once', 'buried', 'maybe', 'crushed', 'adulthood', 'responsibility', 'film', 'not', 'end', 'high', 'note.We', 'get', 'great', 'performances', 'Williams', 'Gosling', 'most', 'impressive', 'aspect', 'how', 'seamlessly', 'transition', 'young', 'full', 'hope', 'slightly', 'older', 'broken', 'more', 'just', 'altered', 'appearance', 'transformation', 'stamina', 'diving', 'deep', 'role', 'get', 'why', 'character', 'so', 'much', 'angst', 'sadness.I', 'recommend', 'film', 'love', 'stories', 'go', 'probably', 'one', 'more', 'guys', 'gals', 'not', 'lighthearted', 'will', 'learn', 'something', 'life', 'love']",N/A

There are a few pretty graphic love scenes in the movie, but they help with the story and not just for the purpose of having these scenes.  You are so engrossed in the lives of the two characters that you spend the movie hoping that they are able to work it out.  The making of feature is very interesting and gives you a new view of the movie that makes you want to watch it again to watch the interaction again.  I really cannot say enough about this movie, every couple will see some aspect of thier lives and will put you that much more involved in the relationship.  Watch this movie!

There is so much thought put into each scene. Just watch the making of the film, director/editor commentary and the film itself. Everything is just absolute brilliance.

And some of the characters were just real people not pro actors.The film, It flashes back and forth between their meeting up and breaking up. The film was actually shot 5 years apart between past and present. Blue Valentine may have taken 8 years in the making. Much of the dialogue is real and not based on the script. It does not feel like your typical overly stylized and intended hipster film. It's very raw and down to earth. The emotions of the actors are very real because the director forced it out of the actors by making them do different things. Every scene, every thought is perfectly developed in this film.

1329140,A2B7XTAY72SW92,B0036TGTDE,TrishNYC,"[3, 5]","A friend of mine raved about this movie last year and put this on my radar. I normally wouldn't pay much attention to a movie like this but with her rave reviews, I decided to give it a go. I was very pleasantly surprised by what I found.The story flashes from present to past, giving glimpses into an unhappily married couple, Dean and Cindy, and their early life together. There is tension in the air, unspoken angers  that bob the surface of this marriage and the only thing that the couple seem happy about is their daughter. But as you see flashes of the past, you realize that they hadn't always been this way. They started off happy, funny, silly and in love. Dean seems like a funny if juvenile young man who immediately decides to marry and build a family with Cindy when he discovers she is pregnant(not his child). Though their relationship is very young at that point, he wants to do the right thing and believes, naively as later facts will prove, that they can make it work. Cindy on the other hand is the product of a loveless and emotionally abusive marriage. She has her first sexual experience at thirteen and by the time we meet her in her later teens, her number of sexual partners is in the twenties. Before Dean, she is with a guy who seems like a jerk though the movie never makes it clear why she thinks so. When she meets and begins to date Dean, it seems like she is destined to live a very different life from her parents.One thing that surprised me about this movie was that this was a young couple who had already grown so bitter and so angry with each other. Usually this kind of anger is portrayed in couples who had been together for many more years, raised children and have now grown fed up of each other. But Cindy and Dean seem to have imbibed all of the aforementioned bitterness despite their youth. This makes it even sadder because it speaks to an unhappy future life for both, even apart.When my friend first told me about this movie, I assumed I would dislike Cindy. But after viewing the movie, I felt sorry for her. Maybe if she had sought therapy early, before getting in a relationship, maybe she and Dean would have stood a chance. But by the time she meets him, she is such a damaged soul, she doesn't have enough to give to another human being. Cindy comes across as unyielding and mean and though she is all of those things, her accumulation of unfulfilled and unrealized ambition makes her so. It is sad to see the love sour between these two but in some ways it was inevitable. Cindy could never make anyone happy because deep down she wasn't happy herself. The sacrifices that Dean made to be with her which she so appreciated in the beginning become the things she will later hold against him.The performances in this movie were excellent. Michelle Williams and Ryan Gosling play their parts so believably and deserve all the praise they received for this movie.In this movie, love doesn't conquer all.",5,Blue Valentine(May contain spoilers),1313539200,"08 17, 2011",2011,2956,"['friend', 'mine', 'raved', 'movie', 'last', 'year', 'put', 'radar', 'normally', 'would', ""n't"", 'pay', 'much', 'attention', 'movie', 'rave', 'reviews', 'decided', 'give', 'go', 'was', 'very', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'what', 'found.The', 'story', 'flashes', 'present', 'past', 'giving', 'glimpses', 'unhappily', 'married', 'couple', 'Dean', 'Cindy', 'early', 'life', 'together', 'tension', 'air', 'unspoken', 'angers', 'bob', 'surface', 'marriage', 'only', 'thing', 'couple', 'seem', 'happy', 'daughter', 'see', 'flashes', 'past', 'realize', 'had', ""n't"", 'always', 'been', 'way', 'started', 'off', 'happy', 'funny', 'silly', 'love', 'Dean', 'funny', 'juvenile', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'immediately', 'marry', 'build', 'family', 'Cindy', 'when', 'pregnant', 'not', 'child', 'relationship', 'very', 'young', 'point', 'do', 'right', 'thing', 'naively', 'later', 'facts', 'will', 'prove', 'can', 'make', 'work', 'Cindy', 'other', 'hand', 'product', 'loveless', 'emotionally', 'abusive', 'marriage', 'first', 'sexual', 'experience', 'thirteen', 'time', 'meet', 'later', 'teens', 'number', 'sexual', 'partners', 'twenties', 'Dean', 'guy', 'who', 'jerk', 'movie', 'never', 'clear', 'why', 'so', 'When', 'date', 'Dean', 'destined', 'live', 'very', 'different', 'life', 'parents.One', 'thing', 'surprised', 'movie', 'was', 'was', 'young', 'couple', 'who', 'had', 'already', 'grown', 'so', 'bitter', 'so', 'angry', 'other', 'Usually', 'kind', 'anger', 'portrayed', 'couples', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'together', 'many', 'more', 'years', 'raised', 'children', 'have', 'now', 'grown', 'fed', 'other', 'Cindy', 'Dean', 'seem', 'have', 'imbibed', 'aforementioned', 'bitterness', 'youth', 'even', 'sadder', 'unhappy', 'future', 'life', 'even', 'apart.When', 'friend', 'first', 'told', 'movie', 'assumed', 'would', 'dislike', 'Cindy', 'viewing', 'movie', 'felt', 'sorry', 'Maybe', 'had', 'sought', 'therapy', 'early', 'getting', 'relationship', 'maybe', 'Dean', 'would', 'have', 'stood', 'chance', 'time', 'such', 'damaged', 'soul', ""n't"", 'have', 'enough', 'give', 'human', 'being', 'Cindy', 'unyielding', 'mean', 'things', 'accumulation', 'unfulfilled', 'unrealized', 'ambition', 'so', 'sad', 'see', 'love', 'sour', 'two', 'ways', 'was', 'inevitable', 'Cindy', 'could', 'never', 'make', 'anyone', 'happy', 'deep', 'was', ""n't"", 'happy', 'sacrifices', 'Dean', 'made', 'be', 'so', 'appreciated', 'beginning', 'become', 'things', 'will', 'later', 'hold', 'him.The', 'performances', 'movie', 'were', 'excellent', 'Michelle', 'Williams', 'Ryan', 'Gosling', 'play', 'parts', 'so', 'believably', 'deserve', 'praise', 'received', 'movie.In', 'movie', 'love', ""n't"", 'conquer']",N/A

Today's soap opera is all dressed up in documentary style replete with improvised dialogue, graphic sex scenes and a ton of angst hanging in the air. Don't despair however--like any traditional soap opera, rest assured that you will discover that the new soap opera will be just like the old--almost completely lacking in wit, humor or a modicum of 'ideas'.Blue Valentine chronicles the breakdown of a relationship, focusing on two blue collar characters, Dean and Cindy (played with an honest intensity by Ryan Gosling and Michelle Williams). Director Derek Cianfrance constantly flashes back and forth between Dean and Cindy's early courtship and the eventual breakdown of their relationship, after they have a child together (played by an adorable five year old, Faith Wladyka).Dean is depicted as a high school dropout who begins working for a moving company and later as a painter. He courts Cindy by singing songs on a ukulele and is supportive of her even after she reveals she's pregnant by another man, Bobby, a sadistic jock who beats up the young Dean after he finds out that he's been dating Cindy.In her younger incarnation, Cindy is an aspiring medical student and is later seen as a nurse in a doctor's office. Cindy's character is even more sketchy. When we first meet her, she's emotionally needy but later when she's 'all grown up', she turns on Dean, simply because he lacks ambition. If Cindy wins no brownie points for her lack of warmth, Dean is positively repulsive after morphing into a love sick puppy dog with an acute alcohol problem. The film's climax takes place at Cindy's place of employment where Dean, completely soused, slugs Cindy's employer in the face, a physician, who promptly retaliates by firing Cindy, who returns home with her husband and demands a divorce.Blue Valentine features some long drawn-out scenes which in part could have been left on the cutting room floor. One such scene is Dean and Cindy's failed tryst at a tacky, futuristic motel room. Yes, we get the point pretty much right away that Cindy no longer has any sexual interest in Dean but we're forced to endure the gyrations until Cindy calls an end to the couple's uncomfortable session together.The contrast between the early joy of Dean and Cindy's relationship and the later dissolution is meant to be sad and no doubt it is. But do we and should we really care? There is nothing inherently dramatic in depicting a dissolution of a marriage unless there are some unique and compelling reasons behind it. Blue Valentine provides us with the most simplistic and sketchy of explanations (as previously mentioned, Cindy's perception that Dean lacks ambition and the brutal reality of his unbridled alcoholism).The Valentine scenarists try hard to provide a psychological context for Cindy's emotional neediness right before her marriage. The explanation is in the form of her churlish, hot-tempered Dad, who is probably the least realized characters in the entire script.If you're looking for a story of ideas, a la Ingmar Bergman, you will not find it here. Rather, all the plot points are one of the standard melodrama, now adorned in modern accouterments. Director Cianfrance is not without talent--he knows how to extract good performances from his actors and works well with his DP and special effects crew (dig those fantastic closing credits). But ultimately, a story about a depressed couple and dissolution of a marriage does not make for good drama.

1329143,A3JLOIXFM75QNV,B0036TGTDE,"Valerya Couto ""LOTRsherlockHPFreak""","[3, 5]","Blue Valentine is told in flashbacks as well as the present time. The problem with that is in this particular film, the entire middle of the doomed love story between Gosling's character and Williams' character is never really established, rendering the whole movie somewhat pointless. It feels very dragged out but if you stop and really think about it, not much was ever presented to us to gain any knowledge about what happened in their relationship. We see them meet, fall in love, so eager and so overfilled with joy- and then we see them falling apart at the seams. Clearly bored with each other, living in their own world. Some might say that the ambiguity of the film is what makes it work, since we never really find out truly what went wrong, and at what time, we can dream up a scenario or scenarios ourselves and that's fine if you want to think that way, but it seems a bit on the sloppy side.Great performances aside, the film's pace is lacking and there isn't much to hold the interest of the audience. The characters are both extremely flawed, so it really is hard to pinpoint who is to blame for their downward spiral. The husband starts drinking in the morning, has no further ambitions in life than working his usual job, and being a father to a little girl who isn't even his own-but loves her dearly regardless. Then we have a wife who is detached, apparently gossips to her coworkers all the time about her husband, and wants really nothing to do romantically with him. Again, we never, ever see how it progressed to this. You see glimpses of Gosling's character where he seems very loving, and caring and presents himself to be a real gentleman and kind person. And we see Williams' character revealing how many sexual partners she's had and the fact that she was 13 when she lost her virginity.

The acting is extremely good, the dialgoue is well written, the direction and shooting are both above par, and the story is believable. However as well crafted as this film is the story itself is of a different nature. I found the story extremely depressing, and while it was a nice tale, it definatly holds no replay value. There's no reason to come back and watch this movie more than once unless you're a film student or something of the kind and want to examine the film for the sake of film. A must see but not a must own. My suggestion is to rent it, watch it once, be prepared to hurt a bit, and enjoy the quality of performances.",3,Can't decide if this movie merits a 5 star or a 1 star review,1330214400,"02 26, 2012",2012,690,"['As', 'far', 'film', 'superior', 'movie', 'acting', 'extremely', 'good', 'dialgoue', 'well', 'written', 'direction', 'shooting', 'are', 'par', 'story', 'believable', 'However', 'as', 'well', 'crafted', 'film', 'story', 'different', 'nature', 'found', 'story', 'extremely', 'depressing', 'was', 'nice', 'tale', 'definatly', 'replay', 'value', 'reason', 'come', 'back', 'watch', 'movie', 'more', 'once', ""'re"", 'film', 'student', 'something', 'kind', 'want', 'examine', 'film', 'sake', 'film', 'must', 'see', 'not', 'must', 'own', 'suggestion', 'rent', 'watch', 'once', 'be', 'prepared', 'hurt', 'bit', 'enjoy', 'quality', 'performances']",N/A
1329145,AMB2Z4FMDBWQY,B0036TGTDE,"VIDFAN ""specfellow""","[0, 2]","Blue Valentine is the type of film in which you come away in awe at how well the filmmakers and actors have captured the look and feel of a real-life disaster but alas, leave you wanting to escape. The actors are trapped in tight, claustrophic close-ups and there is almost no music (except for Dean's singing, some strumming on a guitar, and romantic songs occasionally playing in the background). Like a good documentary, it is unsparing in its depiction of how love turns to hate and regret. Perhaps the most bleak moment is when Michelle William's character, Cindy, frustrates Ryan Goesling's attempts to make love by sexually stiffening her body against him. The juxtaposition of their courtship and marriage against the dying embers of their relationship create a lot of pathos, hearthbreak and pain. That said, I was dissatisfied with the film. One: there is almost no humor and there are few scenes of them actually enjoying family life, apart from the early courtship. Two: The Cindy character is woefully underdeveloped. She is made out to be, basically, a slut. We find out that she first had sex at 13 and subsequently 25 partners. In contrast, all we know about Dean is that his mother ran away with another man, presumably making him fearful of abandonment. We never learn why Cindy dislikes him so much; nothing he does in the film seems to justify her dumping him, other than the fact that he's a slacker and is content with a beer. My only interpretation is that she hates men, due to the fact that her father is shown being abusive to her mother. The lack of details about Dean's family life oddly make more sympathetic. While the actors did a wonderful job inhabiting their roles (i don't think I'll see either actor in the same way again), I find it hard to love a movie that depicts a breakup mostly from the guy's point of view.",4,"Intense, Depressing Romantic Drama Filmed Like a Documentary",1308096000,"06 15, 2011",2011,1850,"['Blue', 'Valentine', 'type', 'film', 'come', 'away', 'awe', 'how', 'well', 'filmmakers', 'actors', 'have', 'captured', 'look', 'feel', 'real-life', 'disaster', 'alas', 'leave', 'wanting', 'escape', 'actors', 'are', 'trapped', 'tight', 'claustrophic', 'close-ups', 'almost', 'music', 'Dean', 'singing', 'strumming', 'guitar', 'romantic', 'songs', 'occasionally', 'playing', 'background', 'good', 'documentary', 'unsparing', 'depiction', 'how', 'love', 'hate', 'regret', 'Perhaps', 'most', 'bleak', 'moment', 'when', 'Michelle', 'William', 'character', 'Cindy', 'Ryan', 'Goesling', 'attempts', 'make', 'love', 'sexually', 'stiffening', 'body', 'juxtaposition', 'courtship', 'marriage', 'dying', 'embers', 'relationship', 'create', 'lot', 'pathos', 'hearthbreak', 'pain', 'said', 'was', 'dissatisfied', 'film', 'One', 'almost', 'humor', 'are', 'few', 'scenes', 'actually', 'enjoying', 'family', 'life', 'apart', 'early', 'courtship', 'Two', 'Cindy', 'character', 'woefully', 'underdeveloped', 'made', 'out', 'be', 'basically', 'slut', 'find', 'out', 'first', 'had', 'sex', '13', 'subsequently', '25', 'partners', 'contrast', 'know', 'Dean', 'mother', 'ran', 'away', 'man', 'presumably', 'making', 'fearful', 'abandonment', 'never', 'learn', 'why', 'Cindy', 'so', 'much', 'nothing', 'film', 'justify', 'dumping', 'other', 'fact', 'slacker', 'content', 'beer', 'only', 'interpretation', 'men', 'due', 'fact', 'father', 'shown', 'being', 'abusive', 'mother', 'lack', 'details', 'Dean', 'family', 'life', 'oddly', 'make', 'more', 'sympathetic', 'actors', 'did', 'wonderful', 'job', 'inhabiting', 'roles', 'i', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', ""'ll"", 'see', 'actor', 'same', 'way', 'again', 'find', 'hard', 'love', 'movie', 'breakup', 'mostly', 'guy', 'point', 'view']",N/A

Where it fails to meet expectations is in the style, that yes is innovative, but the method of jumping back and forth in time is not clearly enough defined to alleviate confusion as to what is past and what is present.To also read the movie blurbs and the DVD packaging that Dean and Cindy take a night away from their daughter to try to save their relationship - that does not appear to be a part of the script that Cindy was acting on. Then we are left with a question of what has happened to their daughter or is that the future or is it that past - it just is not clearly enough defined. The scenes at time become so jumpy that it is hard to hold your attention. The love scenes are pretty graphic, so for those who do not want to see that, do look at this, the definition of romance that is contained in this movie is not for everyone.; but my main objection is in the editing and the need for a clearer method of presentation in the storyline.The DVD has Spanish and English subtitles.
