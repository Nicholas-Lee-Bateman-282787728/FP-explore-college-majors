Passengers deplane from a DC-3. A defeated state Senator doesn't like criticism, or the campaign tactics that defeated him. Blake Washburn returns home with a puppy for his young sister. He dines out with Janice. Blake will work for the local newspaper as the Editor. A boy delivers newspapers on a motor scooter. A school bus picks up children. [No local schools?] Another state passed a bill to end stream pollution. Does it happen here? [Note the trolley tracks in the street.] Iris has a message for Hoskins. People believe what they read in the `Fairfax Herald'. [Have you ever read a story about an incident that you knew about? How accurate was it?] The newspaper will investigate local stream pollution from factory discharges. Nothing is dumped into the river, the factory owner says so. A crusade will build up circulation. Katie will go on a field trip. People comment on a successful business. Blake gets an idea. ""Business Profits Too High"" is the headline. This causes a higher cost of living. ""Who Gets the Big Profits?""Circulation is up. [A hidden agenda?] Katie got a list of names. Is Blake using his newspaper to get back to the State Senate? ""What's wrong with trying to get votes?"" Was his election as a war hero a mistake? School children go on a bus to visit Copper Hill. John McFarland visits Editor Washburn for a talk. He explains how business works, the buyer gets value for what he bought. Is being Big also Bad? McFarland explains what is good. That school bus goes into a dangerous area. [Whose idea was this?] That puppy runs into a cave, Katy and Allen follow. There is a cave-in! Can they remove that load of rocks and dirt with a bulldozer? They call a doctor and more help to clear away the fallen debris. Katie is rescued alive! But she needs an immediate operation. The ambulance races to the airport to fly Katie to the hospital. The resuscitator supplies oxygen to Katie. Another ambulance carries Katie to the hospital. Will the operation save her? [Successful movies need a happy ending.] A lot of things saved Katie. Blake writes a new editorial. Has he learned something?There was a famous event around 1950 in the Los Angeles area when a young girl was trapped in a hole in the ground. This may have inspired this movie. Would a local newspaper attack a local industry that has big payroll that supports local small businesses that advertise in the local newspaper? No, because of the power of local society or the ruling class. An industry that provides a lot of jobs will be treated with due respect. I once read that the job of a movie critic on a local newspaper was to recommend the products shown at the theaters that advertised in the paper. This movie makes a point that a decorated war hero may not make a good politician. Was this a comment on a current situation?",3,Small Town Society,1357776000,"01 10, 2013",2013,2943,"['Home', 'Town', 'Story', '1950', 'filmThe', 'story', 'view', 'city', 'airplane', 'buildings', 'look', 'movie', 'studio', 'Passengers', 'deplane', 'DC-3', 'A', 'defeated', 'state', 'Senator', ""n't"", 'like', 'criticism', 'campaign', 'tactics', 'defeated', 'Blake', 'Washburn', 'home', 'puppy', 'young', 'sister', 'out', 'Janice', 'Blake', 'will', 'work', 'local', 'newspaper', 'Editor', 'A', 'boy', 'delivers', 'newspapers', 'motor', 'scooter', 'school', 'bus', 'up', 'children', '[', 'local', 'schools', ']', 'state', 'passed', 'bill', 'end', 'stream', 'pollution', 'happen', 'here', '[', 'Note', 'trolley', 'tracks', 'street', ']', 'Iris', 'message', 'Hoskins', 'People', 'believe', 'what', 'read', 'Fairfax', 'Herald', '[', 'Have', 'ever', 'read', 'story', 'incident', 'knew', 'about', 'How', 'accurate', 'was', 'newspaper', 'will', 'investigate', 'local', 'stream', 'pollution', 'factory', 'discharges', 'Nothing', 'dumped', 'river', 'factory', 'owner', 'so', 'crusade', 'will', 'build', 'up', 'circulation', 'Katie', 'will', 'go', 'field', 'trip', 'People', 'comment', 'successful', 'business', 'Blake', 'idea', 'Business', 'Profits', 'Too', 'High', 'headline', 'higher', 'cost', 'living', 'Who', 'Big', 'Profits', 'Circulation', 'up', '[', 'hidden', 'agenda', ']', 'Katie', 'got', 'list', 'names', 'Blake', 'using', 'newspaper', 'get', 'back', 'State', 'Senate', 'What', 'wrong', 'trying', 'get', 'votes', 'Was', 'election', 'war', 'hero', 'mistake', 'School', 'children', 'go', 'bus', 'visit', 'Copper', 'Hill', 'John', 'McFarland', 'visits', 'Editor', 'Washburn', 'talk', 'how', 'business', 'buyer', 'value', 'what', 'bought', 'Is', 'being', 'Big', 'also', 'Bad', 'McFarland', 'what', 'good', 'school', 'bus', 'dangerous', 'area', 'Whose', 'idea', 'was', ']', 'puppy', 'runs', 'cave', 'Katy', 'Allen', 'follow', 'cave-in', 'Can', 'remove', 'load', 'rocks', 'dirt', 'bulldozer', 'call', 'doctor', 'more', 'help', 'clear', 'away', 'fallen', 'debris', 'Katie', 'rescued', 'alive', 'immediate', 'operation', 'ambulance', 'races', 'airport', 'fly', 'Katie', 'hospital', 'resuscitator', 'supplies', 'oxygen', 'Katie', 'ambulance', 'Katie', 'hospital', 'Will', 'operation', 'save', '[', 'Successful', 'movies', 'need', 'happy', 'ending', ']', 'lot', 'things', 'saved', 'Katie', 'Blake', 'new', 'editorial', 'learned', 'something', 'was', 'famous', 'event', '1950', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'area', 'when', 'young', 'girl', 'was', 'trapped', 'hole', 'ground', 'may', 'have', 'inspired', 'movie', 'Would', 'local', 'newspaper', 'attack', 'local', 'industry', 'big', 'payroll', 'local', 'small', 'businesses', 'advertise', 'local', 'newspaper', 'No', 'power', 'local', 'society', 'ruling', 'class', 'industry', 'lot', 'jobs', 'will', 'be', 'treated', 'due', 'respect', 'once', 'read', 'job', 'movie', 'critic', 'local', 'newspaper', 'was', 'recommend', 'products', 'shown', 'theaters', 'advertised', 'paper', 'movie', 'point', 'decorated', 'war', 'hero', 'may', 'not', 'make', 'good', 'politician', 'Was', 'comment', 'current', 'situation']",N/A

""Home Town Story"" is a ''B"" grade MGM programmer.SYNOPSIS--Newly out-of-office Blake Washburn (Lynn) believes the son of a wealthy businessman tricked the electorate into voting for him. Blake uses his editor's position on the family newspaper to search for dirt on his victorious opponent. His columns attack the new senator and companies owned by the man's dad.Blake's hostilities soon extend to local corporations. Star reporter Slim Haskins (Hale) doesn't like it and gets punished for saying so with menial story assignments. When Blake admits to fianc&eacute;e Janice Hunt (Reynolds) that he's broken a promise to work for the people and is using the paper only to get re-elected, she threatens to leave him. Slim and Blake argue and start throwing punches. Their personal business is interrupted by a visitor, plus news of a school outing tragedy involving Blake's kid sister.ALPHA VIDEO is a provider of vintage programming that's often unavailable elsewhere.

463309,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,6305417296,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[1, 1]","Hometown Story (1951) features Marilyn Monroe in one of her earliest roles, and while Marilyn probably fuels most of the sells for this item, the movie itself is actually quite good in its own right. Jeffrey Lynn plays Blake Washburn, a newly un-elected state senator who returns home with quite an electoral chip on his shoulder. He's not above punching a guy for joking about the election, and even his old friends are likely to be met with a cold shoulder. Washburn takes over his uncle's newspaper, but all he cares about is starting an editorial crusade that will help him win his Senate seat back. Slim Haskins (a young Alan Hale, Jr. of Gilligan's Island fame), his best friend and lead reporter, grows increasingly frustrated at Washburn's politicized agenda, and even Washburn's long-suffering fiance Janice (Marjorie Reynolds) cannot get through to him, even when she threatens to call the whole thing off. Undaunted, Washburn rakes big business up and down the coals of his editorial pages, even after one local businessman, John McFarland (Donald Crisp), gives him an Economics 101 lecture on the importance of big business and its products in everyday life.Then Washburn's little sister Katie (Melinda Plowman) enters an old mine to retrieve her new puppy and becomes the victim of a terrible cave-in. The wealthy Mr. McFarland comes to Katie's aid in a very big way, as does big business itself through a number of its mechanical and life-saving products. Hometown Story carries an important message, and it delivers this message in a quite moving and certainly entertaining manner. As for Marilyn Monroe, she plays Washburn's secretary Iris; it is by no means a large part, but she does appear in several scenes. Her acting skills are not very polished at this stage of her career, but she certainly accomplishes her main task of making tight sweaters look absolutely amazing. Alan Hale's character has the hots for Iris, and I cannot help but get a kick out of watching ""the Skipper"" trying to put the moves on Marilyn Monroe.",5,A great film that also happens to feature a young Marilyn,1127520000,"09 24, 2005",2005,2042,"['Hometown', 'Story', '1951', 'Marilyn', 'Monroe', 'one', 'earliest', 'roles', 'Marilyn', 'probably', 'most', 'item', 'movie', 'actually', 'quite', 'good', 'own', 'right', 'Jeffrey', 'Lynn', 'plays', 'Blake', 'Washburn', 'newly', 'un-elected', 'state', 'senator', 'who', 'home', 'electoral', 'chip', 'shoulder', 'not', 'punching', 'guy', 'joking', 'election', 'even', 'old', 'friends', 'are', 'likely', 'be', 'met', 'cold', 'shoulder', 'Washburn', 'uncle', 'newspaper', 'about', 'starting', 'editorial', 'crusade', 'will', 'help', 'win', 'Senate', 'seat', 'back', 'Slim', 'Haskins', 'young', 'Alan', 'Hale', 'Jr.', 'Gilligan', 'Island', 'fame', 'best', 'friend', 'lead', 'reporter', 'increasingly', 'frustrated', 'Washburn', 'politicized', 'agenda', 'even', 'Washburn', 'long-suffering', 'fiance', 'Janice', 'Marjorie', 'Reynolds', 'can', 'not', 'get', 'even', 'when', 'call', 'whole', 'thing', 'off', 'Undaunted', 'Washburn', 'big', 'business', 'up', 'coals', 'editorial', 'pages', 'even', 'one', 'local', 'businessman', 'John', 'McFarland', 'Donald', 'Crisp', 'Economics', '101', 'lecture', 'importance', 'big', 'business', 'products', 'everyday', 'life.Then', 'Washburn', 'little', 'sister', 'Katie', 'Melinda', 'Plowman', 'old', 'mine', 'retrieve', 'new', 'puppy', 'victim', 'terrible', 'cave-in', 'wealthy', 'Mr.', 'McFarland', 'Katie', 'aid', 'very', 'big', 'way', 'big', 'business', 'number', 'mechanical', 'life-saving', 'products', 'Hometown', 'Story', 'important', 'message', 'message', 'quite', 'moving', 'certainly', 'entertaining', 'manner', 'Marilyn', 'Monroe', 'Washburn', 'secretary', 'Iris', 'large', 'part', 'appear', 'several', 'scenes', 'acting', 'skills', 'are', 'not', 'very', 'polished', 'stage', 'career', 'certainly', 'main', 'task', 'making', 'tight', 'sweaters', 'look', 'absolutely', 'amazing', 'Alan', 'Hale', 'character', 'hots', 'Iris', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'get', 'kick', 'watching', 'Skipper', 'trying', 'put', 'moves', 'Marilyn', 'Monroe']",N/A

He's fed a different perspective: That the ""profit"" is really to the customer who uses the product. He rejects this idea until he discovers that his privileged status in the community allows him to benefit from corporate resources not available to the average citizen to save the life of a family member, at which point he decides this is a good thing and sells out.
