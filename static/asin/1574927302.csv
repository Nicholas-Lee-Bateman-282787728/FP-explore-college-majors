191982,A2SNUORW55MZWO,1574927302,J-Train,"[2, 2]","I'm a 35 year old man and this movie was awesome. It was funny and deep. My girlfriend asked if I wanted to watch a chick flick with her and since I always force her to watch whatever violent or disturbed movie I want to see, I figured that it would be cool to watch this movie with her. I love all types of movies, so I was excited to see what this was all about. At first I was teasing about the movie, as guys often do when watching a chicky flicky. But soon I realized that this is a very good movie. The story is about a lady who is dying and another lady who is going through some changes herself. They form a bond. The movie isn't depressing as you might think it would be. It's very funny and it moves quickly. This is a high quality movie and I enjoyed it. Don't be afraid to watch this with your chick. If you do she may watch Season 3 of Oz with you... and that is asking A LOT of any woman!",5,Not What I expected,1206144000,"03 22, 2008",2008,902,"[""'m"", '35', 'year', 'old', 'man', 'movie', 'was', 'awesome', 'was', 'funny', 'deep', 'girlfriend', 'asked', 'wanted', 'watch', 'chick', 'flick', 'always', 'force', 'watch', 'violent', 'disturbed', 'movie', 'want', 'see', 'figured', 'would', 'be', 'cool', 'watch', 'movie', 'love', 'types', 'movies', 'was', 'excited', 'see', 'what', 'was', 'first', 'was', 'teasing', 'movie', 'guys', 'often', 'do', 'when', 'watching', 'chicky', 'flicky', 'soon', 'realized', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'story', 'lady', 'who', 'dying', 'lady', 'who', 'going', 'changes', 'form', 'bond', 'movie', ""n't"", 'depressing', 'might', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'very', 'funny', 'quickly', 'high', 'quality', 'movie', 'enjoyed', 'Do', ""n't"", 'be', 'afraid', 'watch', 'chick', 'do', 'may', 'watch', 'Season', '3', 'Oz', 'asking', 'A', 'LOT', 'woman']",Grace & Glorie VHS
