Sean Connery as the hero plays an ARAB!! And, beside, labeling anti-Arab sentiment as ""racist"" is simply lame and brain-dead. Arabs are not a race.  Duh.The movie has it's fair share of slow points, less-than-steller acting, and plot stumbles, but all in all is quite a good movie, and (if viewed with anything but an ideologically-shuttered mind) raises several thoughtful issues.All in all, the movie deserves at least a 3/5, possibly a 4/5.

I mean the quality is very poor, its like a VHS copy and a poor one at that, i've had my shares of watching DVD copied from VHS and it still looked better than this drivel. picture quality was beyond bad, just awful and atrocious. i also had a big problem with the editing, and i was blaming the producers for it before i read some reviews that mention that the editing must have been made by the DVD copiers or the TV or VHS it was copied from. very terrible editing that distracts the viewer.the running time was cut short to around 90 minutes, meaning a lot of scenes were cut, and probably the running time for this DVD was even shorter since some of the scenes were copied and pasted all over again, meaning they repeated certain scenes and attached it over other ones probably for censoring reasons while keeping the original audio.the audio was slightly better than picture quality, but still very poor with today's standards.now i really can't comment on the movie fairly given the heavy editing, censoring and poor quality, it did hold my interest to some extent, at times seemed dragging. acting by Connery was good as usual.the soundtrack was also poor in my opinion, very basic and as if it were made by a kid, some lame Italian or Greek like romantic music which was quite distracting.an insult to any DVD collector or movie fan. zero stars for the DVD, however, 2 stars added just to be fair to the movie.in summary, a barely watchable copy of a long lost film, still very poor with today's standards and unforgivable transfer really, the movie does have potential and seems to have an entertaining quality to it hidden underneath an atrocious DVD quality transfer.so $24.99 ? really ? this should be offered for free given the quality of the DVD. its 2013, this transfer is not acceptable at all.",2,"Poor DVD quality, awful editing",1357257600,"01 4, 2013",2013,2183,"['so', 'Amazon', '24.99', 'copy', 'shame', 'Amazon.let', 'start', 'saying', 'i', ""'m"", 'big', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'fan', 'probably', 'main', 'reason', 'i', 'went', 'looking', 'copy', 'movie', 'finally', 'decided', 'buy', 'one.the', 'movie', 'seemed', 'interesting', 'enough', 'had', 'potential', 'being', 'enjoyable', 'experience', 'had', 'not', 'been', 'poor', 'DVD', 'quality', 'mean', 'quality', 'very', 'poor', 'VHS', 'copy', 'poor', 'one', 'i', ""'ve"", 'had', 'shares', 'watching', 'DVD', 'copied', 'VHS', 'still', 'looked', 'better', 'drivel', 'picture', 'quality', 'was', 'bad', 'just', 'awful', 'atrocious', 'i', 'also', 'had', 'big', 'problem', 'editing', 'i', 'was', 'blaming', 'producers', 'i', 'read', 'reviews', 'mention', 'editing', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'DVD', 'copiers', 'TV', 'VHS', 'was', 'copied', 'very', 'terrible', 'editing', 'viewer.the', 'running', 'time', 'was', 'cut', 'short', '90', 'minutes', 'meaning', 'lot', 'scenes', 'were', 'cut', 'probably', 'running', 'time', 'DVD', 'was', 'even', 'shorter', 'scenes', 'were', 'copied', 'pasted', 'over', 'again', 'meaning', 'repeated', 'certain', 'scenes', 'attached', 'other', 'ones', 'probably', 'censoring', 'reasons', 'keeping', 'original', 'audio.the', 'audio', 'was', 'slightly', 'better', 'picture', 'quality', 'still', 'very', 'poor', 'today', 'standards.now', 'i', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'comment', 'movie', 'fairly', 'given', 'heavy', 'editing', 'censoring', 'poor', 'quality', 'did', 'hold', 'interest', 'extent', 'times', 'seemed', 'dragging', 'acting', 'Connery', 'was', 'good', 'usual.the', 'soundtrack', 'was', 'also', 'poor', 'opinion', 'very', 'basic', 'were', 'made', 'kid', 'lame', 'Italian', 'Greek', 'romantic', 'music', 'was', 'quite', 'distracting.an', 'insult', 'DVD', 'collector', 'movie', 'fan', 'zero', 'stars', 'DVD', 'however', '2', 'stars', 'added', 'just', 'be', 'fair', 'movie.in', 'summary', 'barely', 'watchable', 'copy', 'long', 'lost', 'film', 'still', 'very', 'poor', 'today', 'standards', 'unforgivable', 'transfer', 'really', 'movie', 'have', 'potential', 'have', 'entertaining', 'quality', 'hidden', 'atrocious', 'DVD', 'quality', 'transfer.so', '24.99', 'really', 'should', 'be', 'offered', 'free', 'given', 'quality', 'DVD', '2013', 'transfer', 'not', 'acceptable']",The Next Man VHS

The audio quality, lo-fi for its day, would be acceptable if not for the incredible THD distortion especially noticeable on background music: even at low volume.Furthermore, the 108 minutes running time claimed is not what you get:  you get 90 minutes, period.  Somebody decided to excise quite a lot of this movie.  This was probably taken from a VHS tape edited by a TV studio for  content and running time.  In short, this DVD never saw, got next to, in any way associated with, nor ever had the chance to contemplate what its filmic potential might have been with a decent transfer.  I could make a better slow speed VHS dupe from a VHS dupe than this piece of visual drek.  The image quality is so poor I had some difficulty reading the opening credits due not to small font size, but rather to fuzziness.There is no mention of running time on the box, not surprising, and no inside the box literature.  Shame on Amazon for marketing this piece of cinematic disingenuousness and not giving more detials and accurate information.You've got to watch what you are buying these days.I like the movie, it is a very decent film and one not seen on the market for a long time.  Too bad this is what we have to settle for.
