642335,A33CGUK6890TP3,B00005JOOC,Andre Ali Seewood,"[0, 0]","Meter Maids is an inventive short film with strong character types set in an instantly recognizable situation.  Who hasn't wondered what it must be like to be a meter maid?  What kind of cold hearted ""bastards"" find pleasure in doing such ignominious work?  But I feel that although the film maker has a great vision and an accessible grasp of the cinematic language much of his work is squandered by an over dependence upon music to tell most of his story.  In fact, there is so much music that it actually obscures several comedic possibilities.  But his ability to cast the right people in the right parts (the skinny underachiever, the bulky -yet strangely disatisfied overachiever), makes you wish he would have written a little more dialogue to give these hilarious characters some breathing room.  I'd like to see this filmmaker go all the way with his comedic vision; he certainly has a rich grasp of the cinematic language and has made it bend to his own will.  My only advice is that he use music to ""puncuate"" his vision and not obscure it.",3,An iventive short film with strong characters,1129075200,"10 12, 2005",2005,1051,"['Meter', 'Maids', 'inventive', 'short', 'film', 'strong', 'character', 'types', 'set', 'instantly', 'recognizable', 'situation', 'Who', ""n't"", 'wondered', 'what', 'must', 'be', 'be', 'meter', 'maid', 'What', 'kind', 'cold', 'hearted', 'bastards', 'find', 'pleasure', 'doing', 'such', 'ignominious', 'work', 'feel', 'film', 'maker', 'great', 'vision', 'accessible', 'grasp', 'cinematic', 'language', 'much', 'work', 'squandered', 'over', 'dependence', 'music', 'tell', 'most', 'story', 'fact', 'so', 'much', 'music', 'actually', 'several', 'comedic', 'possibilities', 'ability', 'cast', 'right', 'people', 'right', 'parts', 'skinny', 'underachiever', 'bulky', '-yet', 'strangely', 'disatisfied', 'overachiever', 'wish', 'would', 'have', 'written', 'little', 'more', 'dialogue', 'give', 'hilarious', 'characters', 'breathing', 'room', ""'d"", 'like', 'see', 'filmmaker', 'go', 'way', 'comedic', 'vision', 'certainly', 'rich', 'grasp', 'cinematic', 'language', 'made', 'bend', 'own', 'will', 'only', 'advice', 'use', 'music', 'puncuate', 'vision', 'not', 'obscure']",N/A

I liked the musical montage in the middle, depicting how meter maids trained and worked. The music choice was fitting and I liked the visual humor; reminiscent of classic silent films.The coin toss alone is worth watching this short film. Well done.My only problem was that the musical montage went on a bit too long. It was as if the filmmakers were trying to put enough scenes in to fit the song. Some of scenes were funny, but some were just odd and out of place. The actor definitely looked the part, but he never came across as enough of a loser. I think he needed more of a struggle to make the ending that much more fulfilling. Especially with the dramatics of the coin toss, the ending almost came too easy.Still a very worthy short film.",3,Pretty funny.

The standouts for me were the excellent use of music and the slow motion, animiated spinning quarter that was flying through the air. Good cinamatography, good flow and good use of the alotted time space. The story was just a little bit to predicatable though and didn't really take us anywhere we haven't already been 100 times before in other films.

What I liked best about it was the quarter flying through the air into the meter.  It was totally unexpected that it would fit in the slot of the meter all by itself.  I thought that the woman would catch it and put it in just in time.So, the ending of the geeky guy ending up with the beautiful girl was made even more believeable BECAUSE the quarter flew directly into the slot.I mean, really, how many times in your life does something like that happen to you and you say ""not in a million years if I tried could I do that on purpose?""Very good.

I guess I can relate with the Parking Enforcement Department, being that I used to be a Parking Enforcer at my local university.  We did train our rear ends off! And believe it or not we were all on a quest to give out the most parking tickets that we could.  We were awarded plaques of honor if we gave out the most tickets possible.  This movie is silly in a home-video kind of way.  It looks more like a music or recruitment video instead of a film but, it shows you life through the point-of-view or perspective of the hated ""meter maid.""",4,Check your parking meter!,1128297600,"10 3, 2005",2005,645,"['hilarious', ""n't"", 'look', 'as', 'well', 'made', 'other', 'films', 'sure', 'made', 'crack', 'up', 'guess', 'can', 'relate', 'Parking', 'Enforcement', 'Department', 'being', 'used', 'be', 'Parking', 'Enforcer', 'local', 'university', 'did', 'train', 'rear', 'believe', 'not', 'were', 'quest', 'give', 'out', 'most', 'parking', 'tickets', 'could', 'were', 'awarded', 'plaques', 'honor', 'gave', 'out', 'most', 'tickets', 'possible', 'movie', 'silly', 'home-video', 'kind', 'way', 'more', 'music', 'recruitment', 'video', 'instead', 'film', 'life', 'point-of-view', 'perspective', 'hated', 'meter', 'maid']",N/A

Not so long on the mouth, the rope climbing etc. After Gordon remembers his father's advice we think he is going to do something radical. But then he stands there forver. I wasn't sure what he was going to do. The quarter effect was awesome--could have been shorter--the editor was enjoying that effect too much. But Mr. 306 was also hilarious--the sniffing the air was perfect for the genre.
