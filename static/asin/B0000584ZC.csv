If there is any justice in America, which I sadly doubt, then these young men will be set free and that monster will be put behind bars for life. You are about to witness one of the scariest real life psychos you have ever clapped eyes on, he would eat Hanabal Lecter alive for breakfast and pick his teeth with bones whilst trying to illicit sympathy from anyone daft enough to give it. He will stand one day before the Lord he claims is his king. Judgment day means no one gets away with anything. This monster will pay for what he did. One can only hope these young men get their day in court before a judge and jury that believe in justice and can see the truth. Amazing, but disturbing doco. Well worth 5 stars.

If you care about something other than yourself, then this will move you to want to take action and FAST!!!!  It has graphic images, just a small warning.  Please don't let that stop you from getting the whole documentary.  Like I said before this is a real eye opener.  I still get angry when I watch it or even think about what the three men went through (and are still dealing with).  What got me to want to purchase this set (would have gotten all three, but a friend gave me her extra copy) was a &#34;social night&#34; my colleges paralegal association held.  We watched the 3rd installment and I was captivated within the first 10 minutes.  By the end, if you are like me, you will be either very angry and/or moved to stop this from continuing to happen (both for me).  If you are human and are moved to take action after seeing this I would also suggest looking into some of the books that have been writen about this case and one by one of the wrongfully convicted men.  Please become part of the change that needs to happen ASAP!!!!",5,Total eye opener,1380931200,"10 5, 2013",2013,1168,"['are', 'actually', 'three', 'parts', 'Paradise', 'Lost', 'focuses', 'differnet', 'aspects', 'absolute', 'miscarrage', 'justice', 'care', 'something', 'other', 'then', 'will', 'move', 'want', 'take', 'action', 'FAST', 'graphic', 'images', 'just', 'small', 'warning', 'Please', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'stop', 'getting', 'whole', 'documentary', 'said', 'real', 'eye', 'opener', 'still', 'get', 'angry', 'when', 'watch', 'even', 'think', 'what', 'three', 'men', 'went', 'are', 'still', 'dealing', 'What', 'got', 'want', 'purchase', 'set', 'would', 'have', 'gotten', 'three', 'friend', 'gave', 'extra', 'copy', 'was', '34', 'social', 'night', '34', 'colleges', 'paralegal', 'association', 'held', 'watched', '3rd', 'installment', 'was', 'captivated', 'first', '10', 'minutes', 'end', 'are', 'will', 'be', 'very', 'angry', 'and/or', 'moved', 'stop', 'continuing', 'happen', 'are', 'human', 'are', 'moved', 'take', 'action', 'seeing', 'would', 'also', 'suggest', 'looking', 'books', 'have', 'been', 'writen', 'case', 'one', 'one', 'wrongfully', 'convicted', 'men', 'Please', 'become', 'part', 'change', 'happen', 'ASAP']",N/A

571724,A25J1YHCSSVOCU,B0000584ZC,S.G.,"[3, 8]","This documentary raises so many issues.  Not only the actual question of who committed these terrible crimes, but also just how corrupt IS our justice system?  Do we truly have freedom of religion?  Perhaps only if said religion is a form a christianity!  And also, just how far should police be allowed to go to get a confession?  When questioning a minor, shouldn't it be a law that a parent must be present?  This film chronicles two trials that were an absolute circus!  There hasn't been such a huge miscarriage of justice since the Salem witch trials, and that's exactly what this was.  Someone put on trial because they liked to wear black, read Aleister Crowley, and practiced a religion that was NOT christianity.  It's scary, because I do all of these things as well and I could be put on trial for murder because of it.  These kids did not commit the crime any more than I did!  It is obvious who the real killer is from almost the beginning of the documentary.  And it is sickening to hear the prosecutor say how confident he is he got the right people.  Apparently, since there was absolutely no physical evidence of any kind, the prosecutor fancies himself to be psychic.  *GASP*  Doesn't that make him evil?This film is disturbing, but necessary.  Without it, I know I probably never would have heard of the case and many others wouldn't have either.  These kids in prison would have had no-one to help them then.  Another frightening thought, however, is how many other cases this same thing has happened with and we know nothing about it because there wasn't a high profile film made about it?
