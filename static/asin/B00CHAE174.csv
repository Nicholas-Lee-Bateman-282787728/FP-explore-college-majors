It could indeed become a little more, because there is much to explore between not only the coming-of-age teenage boys, but the tension between modern Jewish thinking within the religious context and the more traditional Jewish thinking (e.g., strict observance and adherence to Jewish religious laws) and the reconciliation between the two. The tension in the film is exemplified in the conservative, lawyer dad of the seeming 'straight' kid, and the liberal Rabbi and dad to the kid who has just 'come-out' to his folks. I don't think we fully appreciate that within the Jewish community, there are various divergent streams of traditions and culture. These traditions may stem from one root, but they branch-out into various versions of conservative or liberal thinking and human behavior and can result in great anxiety on the individuals caught-up in one or the other as they try to navigate and build a bridge between what they feel and what and who they think they are; and what they have been taught and what is morally, religiously, culturally acceptable. The film ""Trembling Before God,"" is a documentary that looks at this theme in a very serious manner and there is an excellent Israeli film ""Eyes Wide Open,"" (a must-see film)that also explores the religious and moral implications of homosexuality and the Jewish religious and secular tradition(s).",3,Short film...this is a short film...BEWARE.,1373068800,"07 6, 2013",2013,1468,"['got', 'duped', 'AGAIN', 'must', 'always', 'remember', 'look', 'film', 'length', 'little', 'short', 'good', 'could', 'indeed', 'become', 'little', 'more', 'much', 'explore', 'not', 'only', 'coming-of-age', 'teenage', 'boys', 'tension', 'modern', 'Jewish', 'thinking', 'religious', 'context', 'more', 'traditional', 'Jewish', 'thinking', 'e.g.', 'strict', 'observance', 'adherence', 'Jewish', 'religious', 'laws', 'reconciliation', 'two', 'tension', 'film', 'exemplified', 'conservative', 'lawyer', 'dad', 'seeming', ""'straight"", 'kid', 'liberal', 'Rabbi', 'dad', 'kid', 'who', 'just', ""'come-out"", 'folks', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'fully', 'appreciate', 'Jewish', 'community', 'are', 'various', 'divergent', 'streams', 'traditions', 'culture', 'traditions', 'may', 'stem', 'one', 'root', 'branch-out', 'various', 'versions', 'conservative', 'liberal', 'thinking', 'human', 'behavior', 'can', 'result', 'great', 'anxiety', 'individuals', 'caught-up', 'one', 'other', 'try', 'navigate', 'build', 'bridge', 'what', 'feel', 'what', 'who', 'think', 'are', 'what', 'have', 'been', 'taught', 'what', 'morally', 'religiously', 'culturally', 'acceptable', 'film', 'Trembling', 'God', 'documentary', 'theme', 'very', 'serious', 'manner', 'excellent', 'Israeli', 'film', 'Eyes', 'Wide', 'Open', 'must-see', 'film', 'also', 'religious', 'moral', 'implications', 'homosexuality', 'Jewish', 'religious', 'secular', 'tradition', 's']",Shabbat Dinner

I also felt the same need to hide such an important part of myself from others!There is also plenty of humor in this powerful short film, which given the intensity of the subject matter is much appreciated!I also had the good fortune to meet the director, Michael Morgenstern.
