Particularly over the last 20 years he's made quite a name for himself and put out some incredibly funny stuff.  ""Happy Gilmore"" was arguably Sandler's most memorable performance, but for me in terms of sheer comedy my favorite was always ""Billy Madison"".  I have loved this movie ever since it first came out. ""Billy Madison"" reminded me of my old childhood days when I'd enjoy the good times, hanging out with friends and not worrying or caring about anything else.  No responsibilities just ""dude"" cool times.  Billy was privileged and didn't grow up until much later on life when he needed to save his father's hotel. Everyone wishes they could be Billy Madison; NO WORK, FUN & ALL PLAY!  The transfers on both films are great for DVD and if shown on the right TV I can't image the blu-ray would look much better.

828905,AS558SNWF1DXG,B00029RT2Q,Clare Quilty,"[0, 0]","Seriously, these are the early classics, untainted by the urge to shamelessly crowdplease.This was Sandler back before he became an industry, back when he wasn't afraid to cut loose and get a little bizarre, before the dreck of ""Little Nicky,"" ""Mr. Deeds"" and what I consider one of the worst movies ever made, ""Eight Crazy Nights.""It's fitting that these two comedies (his best) are paired together.  There's a strain of out-and-out weirdness that runs through both of them that makes me love them and just laugh myself sick.No, the plot of ""Billy Madison"" isn't exactly original but there are bits of ""what the hell?"" moments here and there that make up for it.  The Invisible Penguin,  Drunk Chicks  magazine, Steve Buscemi's sniper, ""O'Doyle rules,"" the undead clown, ""Speak for yourself moron,"" Bradley Whitford's disastrous home-ec projet and lines like ""Who would you rather bone?  Meg Ryan or Jack Nicholson"" and ""If peeing your pants is cool, consider me Miles Davis.""""Happy Gilmore"" lays down the formula that Sandler would eventually repeat into homogenization, but it's got some great gags in it, too: Smeigel's apologetic tax man, ""Endless Love"" lip-synched by a zamboni operator, Ben Stiller's psycho rest home thug (""You can trouble me for a warm glass of shut the hell up!""), the Happy Place and the Not-So-Happy Place and especially a great turn by Christopher MacDonald as Shooter McGavin who can even make the line, ""No!"" hysterically funny. He's one of the classic slob comedy heavies.  A funnier golf comedy than ""Caddyshack"" ?  As a white guy who remains a disciple of Bill Murray, Chevy Chase, Ted Knight and Rodney Dangerfield I still must respectfully say, ""Yes.""Don't underrate these comedies because they're loose and crude and bizarre as hell.

828907,A21B2TJBWCSK1R,B00029RT2Q,Cubist,"[9, 12]","In some respects, Adam Sandler has come a long way since Billy Madison, his first starring role after four years on Saturday Night Live. Recently, he has starred in Paul Thomas Anderson's Technicolor romantic comedy, Punch-Drunk Love and James L. Brook's comic drama, Spanglish. Happy Gilmore helped establish a strong fan base and demonstrated his bankability. He has never looked back since, cranking out one box office hit after another. Universal has gone back to the well and re-packaged his first two solo efforts in one set with re-mastered transfers and bonus material that fans will enjoy.On the Billy Madison DVD there are six deleted scenes totaling 33 minutes. There are lots of small bits and pieces that were rightfully trimmed (including one where Billy does nothing but scratch his ass).There are three minutes of outtakes. Nothing terribly exciting or all that funny.Also included are production notes.Finally, there is an audio commentary by the film's director, Tamra Davis. This is a pretty boring, uninvolving track as Davis points out a scene that she didn't direct and she knows this because she would never have picked the sweater that Sandler wears in the scene. Yawn.Sadly, the stronger of the two movies, Happy Gilmore, doesn't have as many extras. There are six deleted scenes that run 20 minutes, including the introduction of Happy's golf clubs and more footage of his golfing misadventures.There is also a five minute reel of outtakes which is a pretty funny collection of blown lines and goofs.Finally, there are production notes.The Billy Madison/Happy Gilmore Collection shows the beginnings of Adam Sandler's evolution as a box office heavyweight with his own particular brand of comedy. It is nice to finally have these films in their original aspect ratio and with a smattering of extras.

828910,A4FAPQKQQLJY1,B00029RT2Q,Elite,"[2, 2]","There was a time when Adam Sandler was unstoppable. After seeing the movie 'Big Daddy', I remember him achieving almost God-like status with anyone in the 12-25 age range. The guy was hilarious. I know most people are happy about the change that has come over his movies, but I hate it. It pains me to watch movies like 'Mr. Deeds', when he used to make movies like 'Billy Madison' & 'Happy Gilmore'. These two movies are Sandler doing what he does best....making people laugh.Of the two movies, 'Happy Gilmore' definately stands the test of time better. I won't go over the plot of the films, as you have probably already seen them multiple times. I just remember 'Billy Madison' being absolutely hilarious. I don't know if I have just gotten older and have different tastes, but the flick doesn't make me laugh as much as it used to. 'Happy Gilmore', however, remains the funniest golf movie ever made (in my opinion).The thing I like about these movies is they don't try to be more than what they are. You will be reciting lines from these two films to your friends for years. Scene after scene is just classic Sandler. They have classic characters and great cameos to go along with the hilarious writing. While I think the immature comedy of 'Billy Madison' feels dated just a bit, 'Happy Gilmore' retains a fresh feel that I feel is timeless. These are two classic, 'leave your brain at the door' comedies. So have some friends over, get a 12-pack and laugh away. Just don't go into it expecting 'Punch-Drunk Love'. Thank the heavens for that!Special Features: These are ""special editions""? I know the original discs were completely bare-bones, but these are not what I would call ""special editions"". There are deleted scenes and outtakes for both films. Most of the scenes are pointless and you will be glad they left them out of the film. 'Billy Madison' has the better of the deleted scenes, while 'Happy Gilmore's are terrible. And that's about it for the supplements. To be honest, I wasn't expecting much more than this but I am still disappointed. How hard would it have been to make a featurette or something?

828912,A2QZBDTO9F5J06,B00029RT2Q,"Jack Pripusich ""Doctor Pretorius""","[0, 0]","This review is for the DVD double bill of ""Happy Gilmore"" and ""Billy Madison"".  This Universal twin-spin is a great combo for Sandler fans. The good news is the quality of picture and audio is excellent. I played both on a Sony Bluray player, and I was impressed. It's a real bargain, but there are no bonus features at all. No trailers, commentaries, or scene selection. I do think scene selection is nearly prerequisite for any DVD without exception.  It would have been nice here. But, if one is willing to forsake  bells and whistles, sit back and enjoy the movies!  For me, ""Happy Gilmore"" is the better film. Adam seems more ""into it"" and the supporting cast is great. Who can forget his celebrity golf pairing with Bob Barker? Adam's Mom is played by the ""marble rye"" lady from Seinfeld and she's terrific. Carl Weathers is splendid as mentor for Sandler, and the whole opus is ""slobs vs. snobs"" in the grand tradition of ""Caddyshack"" or most Marx Brothers tweaks of pompous authority. Nice job by Vern Lundquist as tournament announcer. He lends precious authenticity to the production. ""Billy Madison"" has its moments, but is not quite as consistent for me compared to ""Happy Gilmore"".  ""West Wing"" fans will enjoy the great Bradley Whitford's  three-years-prior-to-the-white house comedic work here. He is a darn good trouper as Sandler's prime antagonist and not afraid to clown it up. Darren McGavin shines as Adam 's rich Dad. Quite a lot of  special support work here, including Norm MacDonald as one of Adam's pals in mischief, and a nice surprise contribution from another SNL alum, the great  Chris Farley as the school bus driver. But what's with the penguin? Emblematic of the disjointed bent ""Billy Madison"" tends to take when it loses its focus. A great director needs to know when to say ""no"" to distractions that don't support the story. Both movies fit comfortably on a single DVD. PG-13 for some coarse language and sexual innuendo. Adam Sandler is a major talent. These two films deliver the goods!  For an even better flick, check out ""The Water Boy"".

This was where Adam Sandler broke out of his SNL persona and came into his own - and where his fans were born.
