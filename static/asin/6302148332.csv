As I have changed over the years, my appreciation for the film has grown. The artistic conception revealed in many scenes, without benefit of computer graphics or heavy video manipulation, bolsters acting and costuming and small details to provide a simple, innocent, but delightful experience. Leslie Caron was so well known as a young rising ballet star, but her contributions to significant movies over the years include everything from Daddy Longlegs with Fred Astaire to the Trials of Nurenberg. She was a talented all-around actress, and a graceful sprite of a dancer. Her chemistry with the rest of the cast was excellent in this, one of her earlier works. Mel Ferrer showed a depth I did not see in most of his pictures, and Kurt Kastner, another old-time favorite, was a delight. Even today, so many years away from when it was produced, it is still worth a viewing to of a time and place that will never return. I consider this a classic and am very glad I got at least a VHS version.",5,Her chemistry with the rest of the cast was excellent in this,1405296000,"07 14, 2014",2014,1088,"['was', 'little', 'girl', 'when', 'first', 'saw', 'film', 'time', 'was', 'enthralled', 'puppets', 'have', 'changed', 'years', 'appreciation', 'film', 'grown', 'artistic', 'conception', 'revealed', 'many', 'scenes', 'benefit', 'computer', 'graphics', 'heavy', 'video', 'manipulation', 'bolsters', 'acting', 'costuming', 'small', 'details', 'provide', 'simple', 'innocent', 'delightful', 'experience', 'Leslie', 'Caron', 'was', 'so', 'well', 'known', 'young', 'rising', 'ballet', 'star', 'contributions', 'significant', 'movies', 'years', 'include', 'everything', 'Daddy', 'Longlegs', 'Fred', 'Astaire', 'Trials', 'Nurenberg', 'was', 'talented', 'all-around', 'actress', 'graceful', 'sprite', 'dancer', 'chemistry', 'rest', 'cast', 'was', 'excellent', 'one', 'earlier', 'works', 'Mel', 'Ferrer', 'showed', 'depth', 'did', 'not', 'see', 'most', 'pictures', 'Kurt', 'Kastner', 'old-time', 'favorite', 'was', 'delight', 'Even', 'today', 'so', 'many', 'years', 'away', 'when', 'was', 'produced', 'still', 'worth', 'viewing', 'time', 'place', 'will', 'never', 'return', 'consider', 'classic', 'am', 'very', 'glad', 'got', 'least', 'VHS', 'version']",Lili VHS
297944,A17VXFEF21D1YS,6302148332,Amazon Customer,"[0, 0]","A charming little musical that grabbed me from the beginning, Lili is not as simple as it looks or sounds.  This is definitely a character-actor driven movie, with Leslie Caron carrying the weight of film with her wide-eyed charm.  The movie touches on dark issues like suicide, attempted rape, homelessness, poverty, bitterness, and thwarted dreams, but in a marvel of restraint, it doesn't dwell on these things and overemphasize them.  The real focus is Lili's beautiful hope and joy in living.An orphan, Lili joins up with a traveling circus.  She's helplessly naive, but with the family-like troupe and the puppets in her carnival act, she blossoms into a poised, lovely creature.  The puppets themselves are quite interesting and significant - see how they resemble the live characters.  In the midst of all this, the only clouds in her sky are her boss (the brooding puppeteer, Berthalet, played to perfection by the sexy Mel Ferrer) and her unattainable crush (the vainglorious Marcus the Magnificent).  Her coming-of-age is the main plot, made both satisfying and achingly real.Leslie Caron pulls off the role admirably.  Lili is endearingly sweet, without going over the top.  Caron draws you in before you even know you've been charmed off your feet.  Lili loves and hates so simply until she learns better, and then you see her mature realistically.  It's rings inexplicably true.  The two dance sequences showcase Caron's extensive ballet skills without becoming huge productions that halt the story's progress.  In fact, they actually carry the story further - something not all musical pieces accomplish if you think about it.  The fantasy one is marvelous in revealing Lili's alter-ego - she's sexy and confident, and ultimately, not Lili.  The last is particularly moving as both participants come together emotionally.  Caron's face and feet act as much as the rest of her put together - a good thing, as her English is rather accented.Most of the movie is sort of dreamy and surreal.  The brief ""real-life"" location scenes look real, while the rest has the-painted-backdrop feel with clearly fake sets and props.  This actually doesn't detract from the movie or the story, since they are not actually terribly relevant.  The characters hold center stage.  A feel-good movie if you just want to be entertained, a thought-provoking movie if you want to be engaged.See also Paul Gallico's Love of Seven Dolls, the novella this movie and the musical, Carnival, were based upon.  (A warning, the book explores the darker side of the story, but also worthwhile for mature readers.)",5,Magic Dreamworld,1028764800,"08 8, 2002",2002,2594,"['charming', 'little', 'musical', 'grabbed', 'beginning', 'Lili', 'not', 'as', 'simple', 'definitely', 'character-actor', 'driven', 'movie', 'Leslie', 'Caron', 'carrying', 'weight', 'film', 'wide-eyed', 'charm', 'movie', 'touches', 'dark', 'issues', 'suicide', 'attempted', 'rape', 'homelessness', 'poverty', 'bitterness', 'thwarted', 'dreams', 'marvel', 'restraint', ""n't"", 'dwell', 'things', 'overemphasize', 'real', 'focus', 'Lili', 'beautiful', 'hope', 'joy', 'living.An', 'orphan', 'Lili', 'up', 'traveling', 'circus', 'helplessly', 'naive', 'family-like', 'troupe', 'puppets', 'carnival', 'act', 'poised', 'lovely', 'creature', 'puppets', 'are', 'quite', 'interesting', 'significant', 'see', 'how', 'resemble', 'live', 'characters', 'midst', 'only', 'clouds', 'sky', 'are', 'boss', 'brooding', 'puppeteer', 'Berthalet', 'played', 'perfection', 'sexy', 'Mel', 'Ferrer', 'unattainable', 'crush', 'vainglorious', 'Marcus', 'Magnificent', 'coming-of-age', 'main', 'plot', 'made', 'satisfying', 'achingly', 'real.Leslie', 'Caron', 'role', 'admirably', 'Lili', 'endearingly', 'sweet', 'going', 'top', 'Caron', 'even', 'know', ""'ve"", 'been', 'charmed', 'feet', 'Lili', 'so', 'simply', 'better', 'then', 'see', 'mature', 'realistically', 'rings', 'inexplicably', 'true', 'two', 'dance', 'sequences', 'showcase', 'Caron', 'extensive', 'ballet', 'skills', 'becoming', 'huge', 'productions', 'halt', 'story', 'progress', 'fact', 'actually', 'carry', 'story', 'further', 'something', 'not', 'musical', 'pieces', 'accomplish', 'think', 'fantasy', 'one', 'marvelous', 'revealing', 'Lili', 'alter-ego', 'sexy', 'confident', 'ultimately', 'not', 'Lili', 'last', 'particularly', 'moving', 'participants', 'come', 'together', 'emotionally', 'Caron', 'face', 'feet', 'act', 'as', 'much', 'rest', 'put', 'together', 'good', 'thing', 'English', 'rather', 'accented.Most', 'movie', 'sort', 'dreamy', 'surreal', 'brief', 'real-life', 'location', 'scenes', 'look', 'real', 'rest', 'the-painted-backdrop', 'feel', 'clearly', 'fake', 'sets', 'props', 'actually', ""n't"", 'detract', 'movie', 'story', 'are', 'not', 'actually', 'terribly', 'relevant', 'characters', 'hold', 'center', 'stage', 'feel-good', 'movie', 'just', 'want', 'be', 'entertained', 'thought-provoking', 'movie', 'want', 'be', 'engaged.See', 'also', 'Paul', 'Gallico', 'Love', 'Seven', 'Dolls', 'novella', 'movie', 'musical', 'Carnival', 'were', 'based', 'upon', 'warning', 'book', 'darker', 'side', 'story', 'also', 'worthwhile', 'mature', 'readers']",Lili VHS

297947,A3E1UIGSVRQXQ,6302148332,"Bobby Brady ""Radioman970""","[8, 11]","I somehow picked the perfect movie to watch this morning.  Lili.  It's about a puppeteer at a carnival who is bitter because of the hand life has dealt him.  He was a dancer but his leg was injured in the war.  So he performs with several puppets who are really just an extension of himself as he stays hidden below the small stage.  As himself he's constantly bitter, but as the puppets he's able to express happiness.  A beautiful young naive girl played by Leslie Caron comes along and the puppeteer falls in love with her but sees that she is in love with the ""ladies man"" of the carnival, the magician.  The girl thinks of the puppeteer as ""that angry man"" but performs with him as part of the act; she kind of forgets that it's the angry man down below controlling and speaking for most of the puppets.  I thought it was perfect that the puppets all refer to the puppeteer as the boss.  When the girl is sad they ask her why:  ""Oh, is it the boss making you sad again?""  Referring to the puppeteer as ""the boss"".  I just really liked that.I fall in love with the character Lili.  And I relate so much to this puppeteer who is bitter because he wants something better.  He wants to fall in love with this sweet girl, dance again and just be happy.  You're damn right if you think I got emotional while watching it.  I miss working with genuinely nice and sincere people.  Last week I had a shouting match with the ""new guy"" at my work.  This guy is an arrogant you-know-what.  I'm like the puppeteer and do a few things very well that nobody else at my work can do (it's why I still have a job there).  This guy is a jack of all trades who compensates by doing a little of everything.  He's of the mind that ""we can do without you"".  Funny, he's been there for months and me 8 years but he still thinks he's going to swing getting rid of me.  Cuttthroats?  Yep.  But watching Lili was exactly what I needed to do this morning.  I'm like that puppeteer.  I want the girl and to be happy.  I hope others find this movie so warm like I did this morning.  Oh, I am looking elsewhere for work...heh heh...but still Lili has me feeling much happier that I did last week.If this film was done in widescreen (the early 1950s was when that started...to counteract Lucy and etc on the TV) let's have a good DVD treatment.

Yes, well...Many of us have loved this film for years, even decades.  For some reason, MGM has always seemed to have relegated the film to a second rate place, even though it is blessed with a stellar cast, six Academy Award nominations and a memorable score by Bronislau Kaper.  And who can forget the puppets?!So, finally the film sees the light of day on a domestic DVD release, remastered (I use the term loosely).  However, it is as a Warner Archives on-demand.  Now, I have seen on-demand films from Warner that looked quite amazing, but this is not the case with Lili, unfortunately.  Yes, they may have remastered it, but by the looks of it, they put in a modest effort.  At times, even film splotches pop up.  Some scenes look wonderful, others somewhat faded and just slightly better than a VHS transfer.  While I was not expecting Blu Ray quality (and why not, the film deserves it!), parts of the film barely stand up to DVD quality.On the other hand, the film does look better than we have seen it in its VHS release and we should be thankful it has been released at all.

I actually purchased two used VHS issues; the first displayed so much color damage, I ordered a second. Unfortunately, both VHS copies looked exactly alike. It's a sharp image with very clear audio, but engineers who mastered this tape did a thorough job of wrecking what once was some of the most beautiful Technicolor work in the business. Some scenes are far too green, too blue, too red, or washed-out. But it's a solid image with plenty of detail, so with some skill, a PC, some good software, and a huge load of patience, the VHS can make a decent transfer to DVD (my project took 2 months, and I hope I never have to go thru anything like that again). With all the junk out there in digital format, it's a shame that better films like ""Lili"" have to languish in flawed VHS. That said, it's a great romantic fantasy with lovely music. The performances are memorable (Aumont is terrific), the only weak spot being Mr. Ferrer, who does a competent job but seems miscast.

Magin,"[41, 41]","How hard can it be to find a film with elements of homelessness, unemployment, despair, suicidal thoughts, thievery, feigned affection, disability and self-pity? Not very hard you say. But in a G-rated film barely eighty minutes long?Still unavailable on DVD format, ""Lili"" (1953), is available only as a rare ""Video Compact Disc"" (VCD) which compresses movies onto (at least two) CD-sized disks; i.e., a CD which contains moving pictures and sound. By using an MPEG compression standard, VCDs can hold up to 700 Mb (eighty minutes) of full-motion video and quality stereo sound and can be played on almost all standalone DVD players and PCs. VCD quality is similar to that of VHS tapes.VCD not withstanding, and barely a decade after ""The Wizard of Oz,"" MGM still made the industry's best-looking films. The sets, costumes and color of ""Lili"" are outstanding. And at least two things in the film suggest that 1939 classic -- a puppet named ""Golo"" who resembles Burt Lahr's ""Cowardly Lion,"" and a surreal, yellowish road on which Lili eventually seeks something better.We first meet Lili (Leslie Caron), an orphaned teenager, at a bakery where a friend of her late father had promised her a job. But he too has died. Homeless and unemployed, she falls in with some traveling circus performers whose act causes her inattentiveness which immediately costs her the job she does get.Deflated, she climbs a trapeze ladder but is thwarted by the high-pitched voice of ""Carrot Top,"" one of four puppets manned by Paul Berthalet (Mel Ferrer). Paul is overtly bitter that his limp has reduced him from a once-famous dancer to a puppeteer on a French midway. He is particularly aloof towards Lili, except during his puppets' ""conversations"" with her, planned spontaneities which have become growing nightly attractions at the circus. Through these improvisations with her savior Carrot Top plus a foxy kleptomaniac named Reynardo, a cowardly giant called Golo and the pulchritudinous ballerina, ""Margurite,"" she and Paul can communicate their true feelings as well as introduce the hit song, `Hi-Lili, Hi-Lo"" (Best Score Oscar).Sparring regularly with Paul, ""the angry man,"" she is genuinely hurt when she learns that Marc (Jean-Paul Aumont), a vain womanizing magician, is married to Rosalie, his assistant (Gabor). Marc delights in flaunting Lili's childlike advances, warning her ""never come on to a man like that."" Marc is either a true heel or is perhaps too absorbed in himself to realize that Lili genuinely loves him.Although not a musical, the film does contain two wistful ballet dream sequences which showcase Caron's considerable dancing talent. It is thru these musings that she begins to mature as a woman.When Lili learns that Marc and Rosalie are married and plan to leave the show, she tries to escape until she is joined in her second dream sequence by human versions of the puppets she adores, each of whom becomes Paul as they dance divinely. After all, Marc had recently declared to her, ""I am the puppets.""Predictably, it is indeed Paul, the talented but crippled war hero, who is the better choice for Lili who learns for herself, as did Dorothy Gale, that growth can be a painful but ultimately fulfilling journey.",5,Give That Girl A Contract,1125187200,"08 28, 2005",2005,3228,"['How', 'hard', 'can', 'be', 'find', 'film', 'elements', 'homelessness', 'unemployment', 'despair', 'suicidal', 'thoughts', 'thievery', 'feigned', 'affection', 'disability', 'self-pity', 'Not', 'very', 'hard', 'say', 'G-rated', 'film', 'barely', 'eighty', 'minutes', 'long', 'Still', 'unavailable', 'DVD', 'format', 'Lili', '1953', 'available', 'only', 'rare', 'Video', 'Compact', 'Disc', 'VCD', 'movies', 'least', 'two', 'CD-sized', 'disks', 'i.e.', 'CD', 'moving', 'pictures', 'sound', 'using', 'MPEG', 'compression', 'standard', 'VCDs', 'can', 'hold', 'up', '700', 'Mb', 'eighty', 'minutes', 'full-motion', 'video', 'quality', 'stereo', 'sound', 'can', 'be', 'played', 'almost', 'standalone', 'DVD', 'players', 'PCs', 'VCD', 'quality', 'similar', 'VHS', 'tapes.VCD', 'not', 'withstanding', 'barely', 'decade', 'Wizard', 'Oz', 'MGM', 'still', 'made', 'industry', 'best-looking', 'films', 'sets', 'costumes', 'color', 'Lili', 'are', 'outstanding', 'least', 'two', 'things', 'film', 'suggest', '1939', 'classic', 'puppet', 'named', 'Golo', 'who', 'Burt', 'Lahr', 'Cowardly', 'Lion', 'surreal', 'yellowish', 'road', 'Lili', 'eventually', 'something', 'better.We', 'first', 'meet', 'Lili', 'Leslie', 'Caron', 'orphaned', 'teenager', 'bakery', 'where', 'friend', 'late', 'father', 'had', 'promised', 'job', 'too', 'died', 'Homeless', 'unemployed', 'traveling', 'circus', 'performers', 'act', 'inattentiveness', 'immediately', 'job', 'get.Deflated', 'trapeze', 'ladder', 'thwarted', 'high-pitched', 'voice', 'Carrot', 'Top', 'one', 'four', 'puppets', 'manned', 'Paul', 'Berthalet', 'Mel', 'Ferrer', 'Paul', 'overtly', 'bitter', 'limp', 'reduced', 'once-famous', 'dancer', 'puppeteer', 'French', 'midway', 'particularly', 'aloof', 'towards', 'Lili', 'puppets', 'conversations', 'planned', 'spontaneities', 'have', 'become', 'growing', 'nightly', 'attractions', 'circus', 'improvisations', 'savior', 'Carrot', 'Top', 'foxy', 'kleptomaniac', 'named', 'Reynardo', 'cowardly', 'giant', 'called', 'Golo', 'pulchritudinous', 'ballerina', 'Margurite', 'Paul', 'can', 'communicate', 'true', 'feelings', 'as', 'well', 'introduce', 'hit', 'song', 'Hi-Lili', 'Hi-Lo', 'Best', 'Score', 'Oscar', '.Sparring', 'regularly', 'Paul', 'angry', 'man', 'genuinely', 'hurt', 'when', 'Marc', 'Jean-Paul', 'Aumont', 'vain', 'womanizing', 'magician', 'married', 'Rosalie', 'assistant', 'Gabor', 'Marc', 'delights', 'flaunting', 'Lili', 'childlike', 'advances', 'warning', 'never', 'come', 'man', 'Marc', 'true', 'heel', 'perhaps', 'too', 'absorbed', 'realize', 'Lili', 'genuinely', 'not', 'musical', 'film', 'contain', 'two', 'wistful', 'ballet', 'dream', 'sequences', 'showcase', 'Caron', 'considerable', 'dancing', 'talent', 'thru', 'musings', 'mature', 'woman.When', 'Lili', 'Marc', 'Rosalie', 'are', 'married', 'plan', 'leave', 'show', 'escape', 'joined', 'second', 'dream', 'sequence', 'human', 'versions', 'puppets', 'whom', 'Paul', 'dance', 'divinely', 'Marc', 'had', 'recently', 'declared', 'am', 'puppets', 'Predictably', 'indeed', 'Paul', 'talented', 'crippled', 'war', 'hero', 'who', 'better', 'choice', 'Lili', 'who', 'herself', 'did', 'Dorothy', 'Gale', 'growth', 'can', 'be', 'painful', 'ultimately', 'fulfilling', 'journey']",Lili VHS

Walters isn't nearly as flashy as these guys, but where it counts, he's got it all, and as a choreographer, he can design dance films in a way that eluded these other non-dancers.  LILI isn't a musical per se, though years later it inspired the memorable Bob Merrill score for CARNIVAL, but it has more than enough music to qualify it as the kind of picture you leave the theater whistling the tunes from.  And in Leslie Caron they found the right blend of wistfulness and innocence; even her mouth looks bruised, but her eyes light up whenever she sees her darling puppets.When are they going to put this one out on DVD?  OR its charming counterpart, also with Caron and Walters--THE GLASS SLIPPER?Kind of a coincidence that both LILI and DARLING LILI, two otherwise unrelated entertainments, have both been kept from DVD?Mem Ferrer is magnetic playing Berthelet, a man you feel has had an enormous tragedy like Heathcliff.  Leslie Caron appeals to his better nature, and Ferrer makes you feel it.  I wonder if he felt this way about Audrey Hepburn, to whom he was in real life married at this time.  As for Zsa Zsa Gabor, MGM made her look gorgeous here, yes, she looks like a doll, but as Rosalie, she shows signs of spark which warm her up a bit and help to soften her famously blank features.  in her quarrels with the ""Poacher,"" Lili, she actually shows that she can act in character for more than a line or two.  Between this film and MOULIN ROUGE (the original by John Huston), Zsa Zsa Gabor could have gone down in history as being one of the loveliest women ever to grace the screen, but subsequently her nasty, not to say grasping disposition caused her image to plummet way South, and not in a good way.",5,"Career High for Caron, Ferrer, and -- Zsa Zsa",1113868800,"04 19, 2005",2005,1903,"['Charles', 'Walters', 'George', 'Sidney', 'incredibly', 'talented', 'director', '1950s', 'work', 'been', 'too', 'long', 'overshadowed', 'MGM', 'competitors', 'Cukor', 'Donen', 'Minnelli', 'Walters', ""n't"", 'nearly', 'as', 'flashy', 'guys', 'where', 'got', 'choreographer', 'can', 'design', 'dance', 'films', 'way', 'eluded', 'other', 'non-dancers', 'LILI', ""n't"", 'musical', 'per', 'se', 'years', 'later', 'inspired', 'memorable', 'Bob', 'Merrill', 'score', 'CARNIVAL', 'more', 'enough', 'music', 'qualify', 'kind', 'picture', 'leave', 'theater', 'whistling', 'tunes', 'Leslie', 'Caron', 'found', 'right', 'blend', 'wistfulness', 'innocence', 'even', 'mouth', 'bruised', 'eyes', 'light', 'up', 'whenever', 'darling', 'puppets.When', 'are', 'going', 'put', 'one', 'out', 'DVD', 'charming', 'counterpart', 'also', 'Caron', 'Walters', 'GLASS', 'SLIPPER', 'Kind', 'coincidence', 'LILI', 'DARLING', 'LILI', 'two', 'otherwise', 'unrelated', 'entertainments', 'have', 'been', 'kept', 'DVD', 'Mem', 'Ferrer', 'magnetic', 'playing', 'Berthelet', 'man', 'feel', 'had', 'enormous', 'tragedy', 'Heathcliff', 'Leslie', 'Caron', 'appeals', 'better', 'nature', 'Ferrer', 'feel', 'wonder', 'felt', 'way', 'Audrey', 'Hepburn', 'whom', 'was', 'real', 'life', 'married', 'time', 'Zsa', 'Zsa', 'Gabor', 'MGM', 'made', 'look', 'gorgeous', 'here', 'yes', 'doll', 'Rosalie', 'signs', 'spark', 'up', 'bit', 'help', 'soften', 'famously', 'blank', 'features', 'quarrels', 'Poacher', 'Lili', 'actually', 'can', 'act', 'character', 'more', 'line', 'two', 'film', 'MOULIN', 'ROUGE', 'original', 'John', 'Huston', 'Zsa', 'Zsa', 'Gabor', 'could', 'have', 'gone', 'down', 'history', 'being', 'one', 'loveliest', 'women', 'ever', 'grace', 'screen', 'subsequently', 'nasty', 'not', 'say', 'grasping', 'disposition', 'caused', 'image', 'plummet', 'way', 'South', 'not', 'good', 'way']",Lili VHS

To me, this film should have been treated with as much care as Leslie Caron's other signature roles--Gigi and An American in Paris. However, it would seem that Warner Brothers, which controlled the home video rights to this film, could not find a decent print of the original theatrical release and finally decided better something than nothing. This DVD is apparently from the ""best"" available 1:33:1 pan-and-scan television print--and it shows. Although Warner claims that it is ""remastered,"" it looks ""old."" While it certainly looks better than the VHS and Spanish import DVD, there are plenty of artifacts, dirt and imperfection, although fortunately not terribly distracting. Colors are OK, and close-ups are passable, but medium to long shots have progressively poor detail. Still, if this is the best we can hope for, it is ""better"" than nothing. As for the movie itself, it may be a bit ""dated"" and an anachronism of a more ""romantic"" time (although at times Paul's behavior toward Lili is sometimes hard to take, and Lili seems a little too naive), but for those so inclined, it stirs an emotional response that is so rare these days. Bronislau Kaper's music certainly provides an enormous lift to the material, and although there is no dialogue in the final 10 minutes, Lili's fantasy in which she finally ""sees"" Paul can melt even a hard heart.",4,Obviously not treated with the care it deserved,1352419200,"11 9, 2012",2012,1506,"['one', 'lost', 'classics', ""'ve"", 'been', 'waiting', 'years', 'be', 'released', 'DVD', 'deserved', 'better', 'demand', 'DVD-R', 'release', 'film', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'treated', 'as', 'much', 'care', 'Leslie', 'Caron', 'other', 'signature', 'roles', 'Gigi', 'American', 'Paris', 'However', 'would', 'seem', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'controlled', 'home', 'video', 'rights', 'film', 'could', 'not', 'find', 'decent', 'print', 'original', 'theatrical', 'release', 'finally', 'decided', 'better', 'something', 'nothing', 'DVD', 'apparently', 'best', 'available', '1:33:1', 'pan-and-scan', 'television', 'print', 'Warner', 'remastered', 'old', 'certainly', 'better', 'VHS', 'Spanish', 'import', 'DVD', 'are', 'plenty', 'artifacts', 'dirt', 'imperfection', 'fortunately', 'not', 'terribly', 'distracting', 'Colors', 'are', 'OK', 'close-ups', 'are', 'passable', 'medium', 'long', 'shots', 'have', 'progressively', 'poor', 'detail', 'Still', 'best', 'can', 'hope', 'better', 'nothing', 'movie', 'may', 'be', 'bit', 'dated', 'anachronism', 'more', 'romantic', 'time', 'times', 'Paul', 'behavior', 'Lili', 'sometimes', 'hard', 'take', 'Lili', 'little', 'too', 'naive', 'so', 'inclined', 'emotional', 'response', 'so', 'rare', 'days', 'Bronislau', 'Kaper', 'music', 'certainly', 'enormous', 'lift', 'material', 'dialogue', 'final', '10', 'minutes', 'Lili', 'fantasy', 'finally', 'sees', 'Paul', 'can', 'melt', 'even', 'hard', 'heart']",Lili VHS
297976,A2R6RA8FRBS608,6302148332,Matthew G. Sherwin,"[3, 3]","Lili is a superb motion picture that focuses on a young woman's coming of age; this is remarkable in that so many coming of age films highlight a young lad's entering adulthood. Indeed, the film is notable in more ways than just that: the acting and choreography for the dance scenes are impeccable; and the musical score was very well written with a theme song that is easy on the ear. In addition, the casting was very well done and the script was well written. Unfortunately, however, this outstanding film badly needs a restoration. For example, unless there's a close-up of an actor all too often their faces are slightly fuzzy and that's a shame.When the story starts in France, we meet young Lili Daurier (Leslie Caron) whose father has just died; she has come to another town but the family friend she was to stay with and work for has died as well! A neighboring merchant is interested in hiring Lili--but he also wants his way with her which is very much against her wishes! Fortunately, Lili is rescued by the handsome carnival magician Paul Berthalet (Mel Ferrer) and it isn't long before she follows Paul and his friends to their traveling carnival where she gets a job as a waitress. It also isn't long before young Lili becomes infatuated with Paul and she's not exactly happy to see Paul has a beautiful female assistant, Rosalie (Zsa Zsa Gabor).Lili's job as a waitress doesn't work out; and just when Lili is about to kill herself by jumping off a tall ladder used in a carnival act she is rescued again, this time by the puppets used by the person Lili calls ""the angry man,"" Marc (Jean-Pierre Aumont). Marc, a young famous dancer with so much potential, injured his leg in World War Two and he is extremely bitter; he became a puppeteer after the war. In addition, Marc can only express his loving and gentler side through his puppets and the young, nave Lili talks with them as if they were human beings while Marc hides behind the curtain, making the puppets move and giving them their voices. Adult passers-by love it and Lili then gets her second job with the carnival--she is to work with Marc and his puppeteer assistant Jacquot (Kurt Kasznar) in a new puppet act for adults.As if all this weren't enough, the movie also shows how Lili learns about life and its sometimes harsh realities; Leslie Caron does a great job of portraying Lili as she learns important lessons about life while she moves from adolescence to adulthood. Lili learns much through her relationships with Marc, Paul, Rosalie and others.Of course the plot can go in many different directions. Lili wants Paul to be her boyfriend but he is in a relationship with Rosalie; and poor Marc cannot seem to tell Lili directly that he is growing fonder of her every day. And what happens when Lili is noticed working so well with Marc and Jacquot in the carnival--they get a big job offer but will they take it or refuse it--and why? And just how does Lili come of age? No plot spoilers here--watch and find out!Lili charmed me with its beautiful ballet scenes and the coming of age story is skillfully and memorably told. I highly recommend this film for fans of the actors in it as well as anyone who likes coming of age stories.

I subsequently purchased a copy of this release directly from WB and can report that the quality of that transfer is excellent.Those areas of the following review that relate to transfer quality are for the Region 2 release only.As far as the quality of this film's content, it is excellent. It is well-produced, well-acted by an excellent cast with a wonderfully touching story. However, the video quality of this DVD release is quite poor. I cannot say with assurance if it was transferred from video tape, however I would feel confident in saying that it was not digitally remastered from film, as the image lacks the crispness one usually expects from DVD.The color is very inconsistent, vacillating from over-saturated (often to the point of bleeding) to somewhat washed out (aberrations quite common to old dubbed video tapes), sometimes doing so in the same scene. It is interesting that the authentic MGM/UA VHS release is of similar quality as far as the variations in color (even changing hue in the same scenes as on the DVD), although there is very little, if any, over-saturation on the tape version.Sadly, this is another great movie that has not been released on DVD with the quality it deserves. As there is nothing on the packaging that indicates any connection to the studio that actually produced the film, it reminds me of the reproductions of public domain material one might find on DVD at the local dollar store (although the cover artwork is of a better quality) and, in my opinion, at $28.99 this item is severely over-priced.

I had no idea what it was about and only knew that it got a few Oscar nominations the year it came out.  As the movie unfolded, I didn't see much to interest me but I stuck with it.  This young lady who recently lost her father, came to a distant town to look up one of his old friends.  Maybe he could offer her a job.  Unfortunately he, too, had recently passed away.  She ends up with a group of circus preformers who take her under their wing.  She falls for the magician and I was still unimpressed midway through the movie.  However, she gets involved with the puppet show (and, ultimately, one of the puppeteers).  Their act and her interchange with them gets to be quite compelling.  There is a one-sided love interest that develops which dovetails with the puppet act.  That may sound strange but the point is that this is all skillfully put together.  The movie culminates in an extended fantastical lyrical dance that just blew me away.  I'm no expert on the terpsichoreal arts but I know when it reaches out and touches my emotions.  The costumes, the set, the choreography, and especially the dancers all told the story of a relationship discovering itself.  The ending was a forgone conclusion as the dance fantasy fades back into reality.  Essentially the last third or fourth of the movie was such an artistic achievement that I give the whole film a blanket 5 star rating.I like checking out older movies especially on channels like TCM.  It has been my experience that I am more apt to discover a great movie by looking back than by looking forward.  They still make great movies these days; just not that often anymore.  There are a lot of classics from the past just waiting to be rediscovered.

Lili soon discovers that the place is close and the baker with whom she came to work with has died a month ago...With no money, no family, and no place to go, Lili meets Marc, a delightful entertainer who offers her a job as a waitress in a traveling carnival show...Marc's hilarious blend of comedy and magic leaves the wistful Lili roaring with laughter... Marc is breathtakingly good on stage... He is blessed with the fastest hands in the business... Lili is fired, that same night, for spending too much time watching his whole act...Feeling intensely sad, hopeless, drained and helpless, Lili thinks of killing herself... She begins to climb a highly wooden staircase, ignoring a gently voice calling her to come along... She is distracted by a group of character puppets, who helps her forget her sorrow...Lili is introduced to Carrot Top, the interesting fellow capable of running his life and everybody else; to Golo, the cowardly giant longing to be loved; to Reynaldo, the thief and opportunist full of compromises and lies; and finally to Marguerite, the vain, jealous beauty obsessed with self...Childishly happy with the colorful puppets, and not realizing that she is having a big impact, Lili receives the ovation that ignites her creative spark, responding to the four unique puppets losing herself in their questions and imaginations...When she is asked to sing, Lili belts out an old song of love... The entire company of puppets behind her joined in for a stirring chorus... This was executed to perfection that night - accompanied by the waltzing music of the accordion...The show is a hit! Lili's childish manner proves she can entertain, persuade and appeal...But Lili remains dazzled by Marc, who reinforces his spoken humor with visual effects... She dislikes the boss, Paul Berthalet, believing him to be cruel, heartless, frustrated and always angry...Mel Ferrer had the talent for improvisation... He uses his puppets with humor, voice sound effects, stories and more...He captures Lili's heart and soul... And by speaking through his models he was able to express his anxiety, curiosity, austerity, and confusion...Lili, touched by the magic of romance, comes to understand the meaning of love much later... She tells Marcus: 'I've been living in a dream like a little girl, not seeing what I didn't want to see.' She discovers that the love exuding from her adorable puppets comes from the loves of that unreasonable, mean, jealous, bitter puppeteer...Jean-Pierre Aumont adds his charm to the whole story, and remains the beautiful magician armed with an exceptionally likable stage personality...Kurt Kaszner continues to be Paul's loyal and peaceful friend who explains to the delicate girl that the boss had once been a great dancer until his leg was injured in the war and could no longer dance...Zsa Zsa Gabor behaves as the glamorous assistant whose fervent desire is to reveal to everybody her secret...Charles Walters' motion picture is not very musical, but his film culminates in a delightful dream ballet... Caron demonstrates a graceful dancing...The movie received six Academy Award nominations including Leslie Caron as Best Actress in a Leading Role, and won the Best Music, Scoring of a Dramatic or Comedy Picture, and accommodated the hit song ""Hi Lili, Hi Lo.'",4,A sweet little film and a great classic!,1167955200,"01 5, 2007",2007,3456,"['opens', 'bright', 'atmosphere', 'French', 'town', 'likable', '16-year-old', 'orphan', 'looking', 'job', 'deceased', 'father', 'old', 'friend', 'Lili', 'soon', 'place', 'close', 'baker', 'whom', 'came', 'work', 'died', 'month', 'ago', 'money', 'family', 'place', 'go', 'Lili', 'Marc', 'delightful', 'entertainer', 'who', 'job', 'waitress', 'traveling', 'carnival', 'show', 'Marc', 'hilarious', 'blend', 'comedy', 'magic', 'wistful', 'Lili', 'roaring', 'laughter', 'Marc', 'breathtakingly', 'good', 'stage', 'blessed', 'fastest', 'hands', 'business', 'Lili', 'fired', 'same', 'night', 'spending', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'watching', 'whole', 'act', 'Feeling', 'intensely', 'sad', 'hopeless', 'drained', 'helpless', 'Lili', 'killing', 'climb', 'highly', 'wooden', 'staircase', 'ignoring', 'gently', 'voice', 'calling', 'come', 'distracted', 'group', 'character', 'puppets', 'who', 'forget', 'sorrow', 'Lili', 'introduced', 'Carrot', 'Top', 'interesting', 'fellow', 'capable', 'running', 'life', 'everybody', 'else', 'Golo', 'cowardly', 'giant', 'longing', 'be', 'loved', 'Reynaldo', 'thief', 'opportunist', 'full', 'compromises', 'finally', 'Marguerite', 'vain', 'jealous', 'beauty', 'obsessed', 'self', 'Childishly', 'happy', 'colorful', 'puppets', 'not', 'realizing', 'having', 'big', 'impact', 'Lili', 'ovation', 'creative', 'spark', 'responding', 'four', 'unique', 'puppets', 'losing', 'questions', 'imaginations', 'When', 'asked', 'sing', 'Lili', 'out', 'old', 'song', 'love', 'entire', 'company', 'puppets', 'joined', 'stirring', 'chorus', 'was', 'executed', 'perfection', 'night', 'accompanied', 'waltzing', 'music', 'accordion', 'show', 'hit', 'Lili', 'childish', 'manner', 'can', 'entertain', 'persuade', 'appeal', 'Lili', 'dazzled', 'Marc', 'who', 'spoken', 'humor', 'visual', 'effects', 'boss', 'Paul', 'Berthalet', 'believing', 'be', 'cruel', 'heartless', 'frustrated', 'always', 'angry', 'Mel', 'Ferrer', 'had', 'talent', 'improvisation', 'puppets', 'humor', 'voice', 'sound', 'effects', 'stories', 'more', 'Lili', 'heart', 'soul', 'speaking', 'models', 'was', 'able', 'express', 'anxiety', 'curiosity', 'austerity', 'confusion', 'Lili', 'touched', 'magic', 'romance', 'understand', 'meaning', 'love', 'much', 'later', 'Marcus', ""'ve"", 'been', 'living', 'dream', 'little', 'girl', 'not', 'seeing', 'what', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'see', 'love', 'exuding', 'adorable', 'puppets', 'loves', 'unreasonable', 'mean', 'jealous', 'bitter', 'puppeteer', 'Jean-Pierre', 'Aumont', 'charm', 'whole', 'story', 'beautiful', 'magician', 'armed', 'exceptionally', 'likable', 'stage', 'personality', 'Kurt', 'Kaszner', 'be', 'Paul', 'loyal', 'peaceful', 'friend', 'who', 'delicate', 'girl', 'boss', 'had', 'once', 'been', 'great', 'dancer', 'leg', 'was', 'injured', 'war', 'could', 'no', 'longer', 'dance', 'Zsa', 'Zsa', 'Gabor', 'glamorous', 'assistant', 'fervent', 'desire', 'reveal', 'everybody', 'secret', 'Charles', 'Walters', 'motion', 'picture', 'not', 'very', 'musical', 'film', 'culminates', 'delightful', 'dream', 'ballet', 'Caron', 'graceful', 'dancing', 'movie', 'received', 'six', 'Academy', 'Award', 'nominations', 'including', 'Leslie', 'Caron', 'Best', 'Actress', 'Leading', 'Role', 'won', 'Best', 'Music', 'Scoring', 'Dramatic', 'Comedy', 'Picture', 'accommodated', 'hit', 'song', 'Hi', 'Lili', 'Hi', 'Lo']",Lili VHS

This is a lovely gem -- and while it's a terrific family film in the best sense of the phrase, as enjoyable to small children as to adults, it also negotiates some darker & troubling emotional territory with subtle skill. The themes of innocence, unrequited love, crippling bitterness, and callous self-absorption, are all explored in a fairy tale framework, soaked in vibrant Technicolor.Leslie Caron is perfectly cast as Lili. Not even Audrey Hepburn, the screen gamine supreme, could have brought this character to life as well. Her navet&eacute;, her vulnerability, her open & yearning heart are embodied with utterly convincing grace & ease by the wide-eyed Caron.Mel Ferrer is equally good as the crippled dancer turned puppeteer, unable to express his volatile emotions except through his puppets -- who are not, contrary to the Amazon reviewer, the least bit creepy! The ballet sequence in which the puppets become real, and reveal their true face to Lili, is a marvel of psychological revelation.The supporting cast is also up to the task, with warm & delightful turns by Kurt Kasznar & Zsa Zsa Gabor -- and Jean-Pierre Aumont radiates spoiled narcissism with hatefully icy disdain. But in the end, this is Leslie Caron's show, and she fills every colorful frame with life, wonder, and sensitivity.Now, how much longer must we wait for the DVD?
