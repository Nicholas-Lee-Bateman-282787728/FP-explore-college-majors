1164830,A3ANETCTMAN1NP,B0019X3YWS,&#308;&#308;,"[1, 1]","The plot of ""Shutter"" has such a cool premise: a newlywed couple suddenly starts to find a mysterious woman showing up in all of the photographs that they are snapping.  Unfortunately, aside from the appealing premise, the movie is full of predictable scares and anticlimactic scenes that leave much to be desired by the viewer.STORY - Like I said earlier, ""Shutter"" revolves around Ben, a professional photographer, and Jane, his new wife.  They have both moved to Tokyo to allow for Ben to start a new job.  As usual in horror movies, everything starts out peachy, with supernatural horror slowly revealing itself through ghostly developments in all the pictures Ben and Jane take themselves.  Their lives start to unravel as they appear to be stalked by the ghost of a girl who wants them to suffer for some unknown reason.I'll repeat that it sounds really good on the surface, but it quite simply falls short more often than not.  The main characters have the stereotypical stupidity of many horror film protagonists; they insist on investigating dangerous situations.  It presented many classic examples of when I wanted to yell through my TV at Jane and Ben, telling them to just stop walking into seemingly life threatening experiences.  Also, most of the scary scenes are anticlimactic; there is a huge buildup with nothing really frightening happening in the end.  Add predictability to all of the other jump scares and you have a horror movie that won't be dishing out many nightmares at all.I'll end on a positive note: without spoiling anything, the ending is fantastic and ties up all loose ends satisfactorily.ACTING - It's too bad that the story isn't better, because the acting is phenomenal.  Rachael Taylor was a huge standout for me.  I had most recently seen her in ABC's shortlived TV series ""666 Park Avenue,"" and she seemed just as believable in this film as she would seem in ""666 Park Avenue"" several years later.  All the other actors don't even come close to disappointing, though, and made watching the movie bearable.CINEMATOGRAPHY - This is also another brilliant aspect of the film.  The camera working was amazingly professional and showed that the director knew what he was doing.  Without giving much away, there is a really cool scene in complete blackness with camera flashes illuminating the screen ever few seconds, and while I'd never seen this specific type of filming before, I loved it!  Scenes like this made the movie even stand out a little bit, despite the lackluster story.OVERALL - Did I love this movie as much as I'd hoped to?  Not even close.  I was really disappointed with the cheesy storyline ad didn't find myself being scared at all.  The acting and cinematography were extremely well done, but those factors alone won't make me re-watch this movie.  In fact, I'll probably forget about this movie in a few weeks and never end up thinking about it again, and that's why I don't recommend this movie to anyone except those desperately looking for a cheap horror movie with anticlimactic scares.",3,Anticlimactic at best,1389398400,"01 11, 2014",2014,3049,"['plot', 'Shutter', 'cool', 'premise', 'newlywed', 'couple', 'suddenly', 'find', 'mysterious', 'woman', 'showing', 'up', 'photographs', 'are', 'snapping', 'Unfortunately', 'aside', 'appealing', 'premise', 'movie', 'full', 'predictable', 'scares', 'anticlimactic', 'scenes', 'leave', 'much', 'be', 'desired', 'viewer.STORY', 'said', 'earlier', 'Shutter', 'around', 'Ben', 'professional', 'photographer', 'Jane', 'new', 'wife', 'have', 'moved', 'Tokyo', 'allow', 'Ben', 'start', 'new', 'job', 'usual', 'horror', 'movies', 'everything', 'out', 'peachy', 'supernatural', 'horror', 'slowly', 'revealing', 'ghostly', 'developments', 'pictures', 'Ben', 'Jane', 'take', 'lives', 'start', 'unravel', 'appear', 'be', 'stalked', 'ghost', 'girl', 'who', 'suffer', 'unknown', 'reason.I', ""'ll"", 'repeat', 'really', 'good', 'surface', 'quite', 'simply', 'short', 'more', 'often', 'not', 'main', 'characters', 'have', 'stereotypical', 'stupidity', 'many', 'horror', 'film', 'protagonists', 'insist', 'investigating', 'dangerous', 'situations', 'presented', 'many', 'classic', 'examples', 'when', 'wanted', 'yell', 'TV', 'Jane', 'Ben', 'telling', 'just', 'stop', 'walking', 'seemingly', 'life', 'threatening', 'experiences', 'Also', 'most', 'scary', 'scenes', 'are', 'anticlimactic', 'huge', 'buildup', 'nothing', 'really', 'frightening', 'happening', 'end', 'Add', 'predictability', 'other', 'jump', 'scares', 'have', 'horror', 'movie', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'dishing', 'out', 'many', 'nightmares', 'all.I', ""'ll"", 'end', 'positive', 'note', 'spoiling', 'anything', 'ending', 'fantastic', 'up', 'loose', 'ends', 'satisfactorily.ACTING', 'too', 'bad', 'story', ""n't"", 'better', 'acting', 'phenomenal', 'Rachael', 'Taylor', 'was', 'huge', 'standout', 'had', 'most', 'recently', 'seen', 'ABC', 'shortlived', 'TV', 'series', '666', 'Park', 'Avenue', 'seemed', 'just', 'believable', 'film', 'would', 'seem', '666', 'Park', 'Avenue', 'several', 'years', 'later', 'other', 'actors', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'come', 'close', 'disappointing', 'made', 'watching', 'movie', 'bearable.CINEMATOGRAPHY', 'also', 'brilliant', 'aspect', 'film', 'camera', 'working', 'was', 'amazingly', 'professional', 'showed', 'director', 'knew', 'what', 'was', 'doing', 'giving', 'much', 'away', 'really', 'cool', 'scene', 'complete', 'blackness', 'camera', 'flashes', 'illuminating', 'screen', 'ever', 'few', 'seconds', ""'d"", 'never', 'seen', 'specific', 'type', 'filming', 'loved', 'Scenes', 'made', 'movie', 'even', 'stand', 'out', 'little', 'bit', 'lackluster', 'story.OVERALL', 'Did', 'love', 'movie', 'as', 'much', ""'d"", 'hoped', 'Not', 'even', 'close', 'was', 'really', 'disappointed', 'cheesy', 'storyline', 'ad', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'being', 'scared', 'acting', 'cinematography', 'were', 'extremely', 'well', 'done', 'factors', 'alone', 'wo', ""n't"", 'make', 're-watch', 'movie', 'fact', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'forget', 'movie', 'few', 'weeks', 'never', 'end', 'up', 'thinking', 'again', 'why', 'do', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'movie', 'anyone', 'desperately', 'looking', 'cheap', 'horror', 'movie', 'anticlimactic', 'scares']",N/A

Despite the rather predictable way to begin the horror movie with a man and woman freshly married driving along some back road late at night and running over a woman, the storyline actually got a lot better and kept my interest soon after this point.In fact, the story improved so much that I really don't think all the negative reviews Shutter has received so far are appropriate.As far as being scared goes, I wasn't feeling much fear in the beginning up until the woman gets on the subway train and sees a scary looking image in the window.  THIS is when the story really gets going and the fear increases significantly.The entire movie had a feel very similar to the Ring with a dark and eerie setting, and the pacing is similar as well as far as the whole mystery approach goes.  Since I consider the Ring one of the best horror movies in the last 10 years or so, I thought this movie did a pretty decent job of capturing a similar vibe.Also, the focus on taking pictures and seeing ghostly images in the pictures was done VERY well because the ghosts usually appear in places that aren't so predictable in the photo.Alright, so the film obviously has a Hollywood feel to it, but that doesn't bother me any.

1164844,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B0019X3YWS,Chris Pandolfi,"[15, 21]","It's getting tiresome writing reviews like this. As I watched ""Shutter,"" I had the exact same opinion that I had for films like ""The Messengers"" and ""One Missed Call"" and ""The Eye"" and ""The Grudge"": it's a frightening movie with plentiful clich&eacute;s and a completely unoriginal story. The very fact that it's an American remake of an Asian horror film is a clich&eacute; in and of itself. Does any of this make it a bad film? Not necessarily, although more than a few people will be annoyed at how routine and predictable it is. No, ""bad"" is too strong a word here, but ""rehash"" is not--""Shutter"" seems to have no qualms about telling the exact same story over again, the kind of story that has already been told a countless number of times. What you see is pretty much what you get.This isn't to say that it doesn't deliver in some key areas, namely creepiness and the ability to startle the audience at just the right moments. It's correctly billed as a horror film; many sequences function in much the same way as a carnival funhouse, with unknown things lurking in the shadows before jumping out and yelling ""Boo!"" But when it comes to the plot, not much is left to the imagination. Just about everything you expect to happen will actually happen, and the characters function like typical horror movie victims by screaming a lot and asking aloud if anyone's there. I've never been one for shouting back to a movie screen, but films like ""Shutter"" make me understand why it happens from time to time: every moment is so obvious that you just want to knock some sense into the characters: ""Of course no one's there! Something will appear the instant you turn around, dummy!""The plot: Ben Shaw (Joshua Jackson) is a photographer who just married the love of his life, Jane (Rachael Taylor). They then fly to Tokyo where Ben is to take part in a big photo shoot. But trouble begins almost as soon as they arrive; as Jane drives on a deserted rural road in the middle of the night, a Japanese woman steps in front of the car and is presumably run over. Jane desperately searches for the woman's body but finds nothing, hinting at the fact that Jane imagined the whole thing. But wait--as she looks through some of Ben's developed honeymoon photos, she notices that many of them are obscured by odd streaks of white light, and even stranger, the streaks display the faded image of a woman's face. It isn't long before Ben begins to sense something strange, not helped by the fact that the left side of his neck is constantly sore.The bright phenomenon in the pictures is the mark of spiritual photography, in which an image of the person's spirit is captured on film. Apparently, only a spirit with strong emotional baggage can be seen; they love or hate so strongly that they find themselves attached to a living person. After Jane and Ben begin experiencing odd supernatural occurrences, Jane realizes that the Japanese woman is somehow connected with Ben. But how? What could she possibly want from him now? And why are many of Ben's business associates dying under mysterious circumstances? The basic answer to all of the above is actually another question: Who cares? If the filmmakers had actually attempted to tell a decent story--or, at the very least, an original story--I wouldn't have had to pose sarcastic questions in the first place.To be as fair as possible, ""Shutter"" does have some very effective moments. I distinctly remember a scene in which Ben is in his studio alone: after all the lights suddenly go out, bright camera flashes intermittently go off, giving the audience the tiniest glimpses of the ghost in the room. There's also a moment when Ben is in his darkroom: he believes that the hand touching his face belongs to Jane, but a phone call makes him realize that this isn't the case. You can't help but tremble during such scenes. If only I had been trembling throughout the entire film. That is what horror movies are for, aren't they? Unfortunately, a story this overused reduces the scare factor by a considerable amount. For one thing, it's obvious that Ben isn't telling Jane the whole truth about his relationship with the Japanese woman. It's also obvious that Jane will be the one to discover everything, and this, of course, will come after the moment when everything seems under control.Does all this mean that you shouldn't see ""Shutter""? That would depend on whether or not you've seen the films I mentioned at the start of this review, among others. If you have seen them, then there's absolutely nothing new ""Shutter"" can offer you. If you haven't ... well, then it's entirely your call. You might find many of the smaller moments entertaining, such as a man's eye being gouged out from the eyepiece of a camera, or the discovery of a rotting corpse, or when the ghost starts French kissing Ben. Then again, you may not find that entertaining at all. Ultimately, this movie is no worse than any recent film about a ghost back for revenge, but it's no better either; you watch it knowing you've seen it before, and you leave knowing you'll see it again. I guess the adage of a picture being worth a thousand words doesn't always apply to horror movies.",3,A Picture is Worth a Thousand Screams,1206057600,"03 21, 2008",2008,5196,"['getting', 'tiresome',

1164845,AT2L9P49VHVY5,B0019X3YWS,Christopher R,"[3, 6]","For a while I thought this movie was going to be different in that the ghost is not someone wronged and looking to set the world right, but a psychotic sociopath in life that brought her craziness into the afterlife to haunt the people she knew.  Holding onto the notion that this movie was going to buck that trend, and being compelled by a couple of genuinely suspenseful moments, I thought the trend of horrible Hollywood remakes of Japanese ghost movies was coming to an end.Instead, Shutter fits the general Japanese ghost movie ad lib storyline:  pissed off Japanese girl wronged by someone in life goes on to haunt and kill those she perceived to do her wrong, all while the viewer lies in suspense with the protagonists trying to figure out how the ghost was slighted and how they can eliminate the poltergeist.  In this movie, the husband let the obsessive former girlfriend be raped by his coworkers in a foolish attempt to get her to be less obsessive and clingy after her father died.  The ghost is running around getting her revenge and looking out for the new baby mamma by trying to send her a message to stay away from her ethically challenged husband.  New wife leaves and the husband goes insane, off to live in a loony bin being haunted by the wronged former flame for the rest of his life.*Yawn...*  Same story every time.  Why did I rent this movie?  I should have been able to tell by the stylized cover art that looks the same in each of the Japanese ghost film remakes, but I didn't bother to take a closer look.I have to admit, though, Shutter had me going for a while.  It does a better job than some of the other recent Japanese ghost remakes (One Missed Call comes to mind) of holding the viewer in suspense until the end.  The reason for less than four stars is that it ended up fitting the same tired ad lib storyline.  The reason for more than two is that there was some genuine suspense.",3,Rent it.

In fact if it was not for the ending this one would be really lacking because it just felt like, I don't know. I just did not get into this one as much as others and found it to be just your average remake. I guess there will never be a really good American remake at least for a while.Ben and Jane are newlywed's that are moving to Japan for Ben's new job, he is a photographer. His friends helped him get the job and he could not be happier, until his wife starts to have ghostly images appear before her. It does not take long before the ghostly woman starts to cause bodily harm and now Ben is seeing her two. As time goes on all those around Jane start to feel the effects of this spirit because all is not what it seems. So as Jane struggles to find out what is going on people start to get picked off one by one as time runs.This film suffers from just being too much like the rest of the remakes out there and therefore just feels old. The performances are good as far as I am concerned and there are some good moments like the ending. The thing is that is still not enough to save this movie from just being average. There are some decent deaths in this and the story is cool especially when every thing starts to come together. Rachael Taylor plays Jane and performs fine as does Joshua Jackson and the rest of the cast. David Denman and John Hensley are great in this and make for a good surprise along with Jackson's character.Like I said this movie is not horrible it is just average and too much like every other remake out there. Still if you have not seen it a rental would be sufficient but I recommend the original film. Also I recommend the unrated version mainly because of the kills which I guess is the only reason there is a unrated version. To be honest I have not seen the rated version but it can't be better than the unrated.",3,JUST YOUR AVERAGE AMERICAN REMAKE,1255651200,"10 16, 2009",2009,2100,"['SHUTTERThis', 'American', 'remake', 'film', 'was', 'much', 'better', 'came', 'country', 'time', 'based', 'Thai', 'film', 'do', 'believe', 'much', 'rest', 'American', 'remakes', 'one', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'original', 'fact', 'was', 'not', 'ending', 'one', 'would', 'be', 'really', 'lacking', 'just', 'felt', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'just', 'did', 'not', 'get', 'one', 'as', 'much', 'others', 'found', 'be', 'just', 'average', 'remake', 'guess', 'there', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'really', 'good', 'American', 'remake', 'least', 'while.Ben', 'Jane', 'are', 'newlywed', 'are', 'moving', 'Japan', 'Ben', 'new', 'job', 'photographer', 'friends', 'helped', 'get', 'job', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'happier', 'wife', 'have', 'ghostly', 'images', 'appear', 'not', 'take', 'long', 'ghostly', 'woman', 'cause', 'bodily', 'harm', 'now', 'Ben', 'seeing', 'two', 'time', 'Jane', 'start', 'feel', 'effects', 'spirit', 'not', 'what', 'So', 'Jane', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'going', 'people', 'start', 'get', 'picked', 'off', 'one', 'one', 'time', 'runs.This', 'film', 'suffers', 'just', 'being', 'too', 'much', 'rest', 'remakes', 'there', 'therefore', 'just', 'feels', 'old', 'performances', 'are', 'good', 'as', 'far', 'am', 'concerned', 'are', 'good', 'moments', 'ending', 'thing', 'still', 'not', 'enough', 'save', 'movie', 'just', 'being', 'average', 'are', 'decent', 'deaths', 'story', 'cool', 'especially', 'when', 'thing', 'come', 'together', 'Rachael', 'Taylor', 'Jane', 'performs', 'fine', 'Joshua', 'Jackson', 'rest', 'cast', 'David', 'Denman', 'John', 'Hensley', 'are', 'great', 'make', 'good', 'surprise', 'Jackson', 'character.Like', 'said', 'movie', 'not', 'horrible', 'just', 'average', 'too', 'much', 'other', 'remake', 'there', 'Still', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'rental', 'would', 'be', 'sufficient', 'recommend', 'original', 'film', 'Also', 'recommend', 'unrated', 'version', 'mainly', 'kills', 'guess', 'only', 'reason', 'unrated', 'version', 'be', 'honest', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'rated', 'version', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'better', 'unrated']",N/A

A newly married photographer travels to Tokyo with his bride for a new job. As they are on their way to a quick honeymoon, a woman walks into the road and the new bride strikes her with the car. The body isn't found. Then they take some honeymoon photos, and get them back, they find a blur or image in the photos. More strange and seemingly supernatural occurrences keep happening, and the wife blames the occurrences on the girl they hit with the car. The occurrences get more dangerous as the mystery unravels. There is a nice creep factor in a few scenes, and I actually jumped. The acting was also pretty good, and the spirit photo angle was interesting. To &#8220;American-ize&#8221; this ghost story, they really could have had it take place in America. I understand The Grudge, and many other stories taking place in Japan, but this is simply a ghost story, and not Japanese legend. There were some other flaws about details of the movie that can be ignored. There were also some decisions by the characters that don't make sense, even for a thriller movie. That being said, and though it was quite predictable, Shutter was still a decent 3 star movie. However, I only recommend to horror, thriller, or ghost story fans.

In fact, it didn't Ring true to the horror genre, and I may hold a Grudge.I sincerely hope that everyone who watches this film catches onto my gist.  This is yet another in the long line of unoriginal Japanese horror remakes in which the actors paint by the numbers, the ""scares"" can be seen from orbit, and several unintentionally comical scenes (more so than the gore or original scenes evoking, you know, horror) carry the film between the ubiquitous regurgitated clich&eacute;s.After their wedding, Ben Shaw (Joshua Jackson) and his wife Jane (Rachael Taylor) move to Japan to pursue Ben's career as a fashion photographer.  After Jane plows through a random Japanese girl on the highway, and a subsequent investigation takes place, the couple proceed to their Honeymoon where Ben appears unfazed.  Because nothing says Honeymoon like post vehicular manslaughter romance.  Soon thereafter Ben's first big shoot goes awry, and the couple spend the next hour or so investigating perplexing white splotches on the photos that look mysteriously like reflections of dust particles or perhaps photographed moisture.  Needless to say, Ben could have saved a lot of time if he had simply figured out how to focus his camera and use the F-Stop.The predictable cause/effect unravels into a revenge plot in which a specter tightens sphincters, and I laughed at the unintentional comedy.  The pinnacle of this hilarity takes place when Ben photographs himself only to find the Japanese spirit sitting on his shoulders.  Naturally he wrestles himself like a bad Fight Club remake.  I kid you not.Insert random light and/or sound change for cheap (read: poorly done) shocks, random twist, aaand roll credits.

This movie was made for my taste as I have always liked deliberately paced horror films which ultimately pay off.  What I learned from seeing this film was that Spirit Photography has a solid niche in modern Japanese culture. The Japanese also have a unique interest in ghostly or spirit related tales.  This goes far back into the Japanese tradition. Consequently, these films may receive the benefit of being taken more seriously in Japan, or Japanese audiences may posses greater ability to suspend disbelief. This movie was made by the same executive producer as ""The Grudge"" and ""The Ring"", which also were inspired by Asian films.According to the very interesting documentary included with the movie, Japanese tradition describes both the protective spirit who may become an honored guardian of the family, and a restless or vengeful spirit who may linger on and be the center of a haunting.  Such vengeful ghosts either wish to settle a score, or relate a message of murder and injustice.  In any case, these movie makers were trying to present such a tale based on the original Asian version of the film ""Shutter"", along with some good modifications for American audiences.

1164867,A2RKI7RPP5CJMG,B0019X3YWS,"K. Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!""","[3, 5]","Yes, I am well aware that ""Shutter"" is just one more ingredient in a seemingly endless Westernized stew of Asian horror remakes.  I'm also aware that it features Joshua Jackson, one of the most boring actors to ever grace a screen.  With that said, though, I have to admit that I enjoyed it.Director Masayuki Ochiai takes the basic elements of Asian horror (lack of special effects, excellent use of lighting, downright creepy-looking people to portray ghosts) and utilizes them quite well.  The only thing missing is a creepy sound here and there.Rachael Taylor (""Transformers"") plays Jane Shaw, the heroine of the film who is trying to figure out who she and her husband, Benjamin (Jackson, Pacey from ""Dawson's Creek"") hit with their car while on their honeymoon.  By the time that police arrive on the scene and the couple has regained consciousness, the girl they hit has vanished.Also, strange lights and blurs begin to show up in their honeymoon photos.  When Benjamin takes a photography job in Tokyo with his buddies, things get even more bizarre.  His professional photos begin to experience the same fate as the honeymoon pics.  Jane begins to see the lady she hit all over the place.  An assistant of Benjamin tells Jane that what they captured in their pics are actually spirits trying to communicate with them.  From there, the story falls into generic Asian horror mode and concludes in much the same fashion.As already mentioned, token effects of Asian horror are used to an excellent degree.  One particular sequence involving a flashbulb in a darkened room uses the lighting perfectly.  There's also a general creepy feel about the whole film.The performances of the actors and actresses are mixed.  All are hampered by flat dialogue, but despite this, Jackson and Taylor do pretty decent jobs.  The poorest performance of the film comes via John Hensley as a pompous agent.  He doesn't look the part nor does he act it very well either.  Megumi Okina gives a solid performance as Megumi Tanaka, the ghost in this tale.Telling you who the true villian(s) is might be considered a spoiler by some, but it's pretty obvious who the baddie is from the beginning.  That's sort of what makes this film appeal to me.  It's so obvious who the bad person is that you don't have to spend any time trying to figure it out.  You get to watch everything the ghost does with the satisfaction of knowing that she's going to give it to whoever deserves it in the end.  The only unknown factor is ""why"" she's after this person.The DVD comes with an interesting look at Asian beliefs on supernatural phenomena.  It also explains that a lot of the religious aspects of the original film were left out so as not to confuse Western audiences.  There's also a look into spirit photography and a very dull and generic ""Ghost Hunting"" tutorial.Overall, ""Shutter"" isn't the most terrible film in the world.

Instead of rehashing all of the old complaints (another Japanese remake! same old scares and scenes! just likeThe Grudge!), let me tell you why this movie fails for me.The best ghost movies out there are trying to tell a story.  The ghost exists for a reason, and the reason isn't exclusively to scare the bejeezus out of people.  When that IS the goal (seePoltergeist), there still must be a story attached to the fear.  I guess, ultimately, ghost films have two burdens to bear: creative plots married to creative creepiness.Unfortunately, SHUTTER doesn't have much of either.  A young camerman (Joshua Jackson) and his new bride (Rachael Taylor) move to Tokyo where he has a new highpaying gig.  Somewhere along the way they (may or may not have) hit a woman wandering alone on a dark, forest road.  The woman disappears and, whoops!, they are both tormented by the woman's ghostly image.Nothing creepy about this film is unique to it.  The directing and the cinematography are well-done, the acting not so, and the end result is a series of dark Ho-Hums, much like you might experience on the Haunted House ride at your local autumn fair.  It doesn't necessarily flop on that score, in spite of the unimaginative story, but the requisite twist ending drags the whole thing out to a length that will make you check your watch more than once.For many ghost films, I often find myself asking, ""Why doesn't she just..."" and ""Why did he...""  The rules the ghost plays by are never clear, and when our spiritual succubus cranks things up a notch, you have to ask yourself if she's just learning how to be more creative, or if it's solely because the writer is trying to follow the tried and true Rules of Plot. (""All the stakes must be raised in the Third Act."")  Likewise, Jackson's character doesn't have enough depth to justify anything he is supposed to have done.  To be frank, none of the characters have much depth, but in Jackson, it stands out the most.Even these flaws aren't particularly lethal for horror movies, but the final scenes and Jackson's final actions are utterly incomprehensible.  I won't spoil anything here, other than to say that Jackson's final solution for it all strains credulity.  I'm not saying I would be thinking clearly if I were tortured by an Asian presence from beyond the grave, but I also doubt I would resort to the sort of brainlessly violent resolution Jackson's desperate photog employs.SHUTTER is, ultimately, another movie that's only as scary as the audience is willing to let it be, a passable and forgettable ""boo!"" that is more trick than treat.",3,A Case Of Too Much Exposure,1219190400,"08 20, 2008",2008,2627,"['Ghost', 'movies', 'Give', 'break', 'Instead', 'rehashing', 'old', 'complaints', 'Japanese', 'remake', 'same', 'old', 'scares', 'scenes', 'just', 'likeThe', 'Grudge', 'let', 'tell', 'why', 'movie', 'me.The', 'best', 'ghost', 'movies', 'are', 'trying', 'tell', 'story', 'ghost', 'reason', 'reason', ""n't"", 'exclusively', 'scare', 'bejeezus', 'people', 'When', 'goal', 'seePoltergeist', 'still', 'must', 'be', 'story', 'attached', 'fear', 'guess', 'ultimately', 'ghost', 'films', 'have', 'two', 'burdens', 'bear', 'creative', 'plots', 'married', 'creative', 'creepiness.Unfortunately', 'SHUTTER', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'either', 'young', 'camerman', 'Joshua', 'Jackson', 'new', 'bride', 'Rachael', 'Taylor', 'move', 'Tokyo', 'where', 'new', 'highpaying', 'gig', 'Somewhere', 'way', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'hit', 'woman', 'wandering', 'alone', 'dark', 'forest', 'road', 'woman', 'whoops', 'are', 'tormented', 'woman', 'ghostly', 'image.Nothing', 'creepy', 'film', 'unique', 'directing', 'cinematography', 'are', 'well-done', 'acting', 'not', 'so', 'end', 'result', 'series', 'dark', 'Ho-Hums', 'much', 'might', 'experience', 'Haunted', 'House', 'ride', 'local', 'autumn', 'fair', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'flop', 'score', 'spite', 'unimaginative', 'story', 'requisite', 'twist', 'ending', 'whole', 'thing', 'out', 'length', 'will', 'make', 'check', 'watch', 'more', 'once.For', 'many', 'ghost', 'films', 'often', 'find', 'asking', 'Why', ""n't"", 'just', 'Why', 'did', 'rules', 'ghost', 'plays', 'are', 'never', 'clear', 'when', 'spiritual', 'succubus', 'cranks', 'things', 'up', 'notch', 'have', 'ask', 'just', 'learning', 'how', 'be', 'more', 'creative', 'solely', 'writer', 'trying', 'follow', 'tried', 'true', 'Rules', 'Plot', 'stakes', 'must', 'be', 'raised', 'Third', 'Act', 'Likewise', 'Jackson', 'character', ""n't"", 'have', 'enough', 'depth', 'justify', 'anything', 'supposed', 'have', 'done', 'be', 'frank', 'none', 'characters', 'have', 'much', 'depth', 'Jackson', 'out', 'most.Even', 'flaws', 'are', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'lethal', 'horror', 'movies', 'final', 'scenes', 'Jackson', 'final', 'actions', 'are', 'utterly', 'incomprehensible', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'anything', 'here', 'other', 'say', 'Jackson', 'final', 'solution', 'credulity', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'would', 'be', 'thinking', 'clearly', 'were', 'tortured', 'Asian', 'presence', 'grave', 'also', 'doubt', 'would', 'resort', 'sort', 'brainlessly', 'violent', 'resolution', 'Jackson', 'desperate', 'photog', 'employs.SHUTTER', 'ultimately', 'movie', 'only', 'as', 'scary', 'audience', 'willing', 'let', 'be', 'passable', 'forgettable', 'boo', 'more', 'trick', 'treat']",N/A

1164879,AFV2584U13XP3,B0019X3YWS,Rich(Anime&Games Will Always Prevail!),"[2, 3]",This is probably the third worst re-make of an Asian horror movie I have had the unfortunate luck and choice of watching(The first movie I feel was The Ring 2 and the other was The Grudge 2).  Another point I like to say is one or two reviewers keep saying how this is a horrible J-horror re-make when an actuality the original is a horror movie from Thailand. This re-make does at least follow most of the original story-plot for the most part and that's probably one of the few things I can think of that I like about the re-make.  The short storyline is that you have three male friends who are all working or living in Japan and seem to be great people but these three have actually committed a horrible crime in their past and have covered it up.  Here is where you see one of the three who has recently gotten married and is working for one of the other three friends as a professional photographer.  Then the wife starts to see and experience unusual things causing her husband who's at first skeptical to check it out.  After a while the husband and his other two friends start to experience the same phenomenon and than after a few says one of the three friends is killed by some spirit.  Of course you'll learn more of why this is happening to the three male friends and why the wife is part of the spiritual phenomenon too.  Some of the actors weren't to bad but in all it seemed to me that most were acting pretty stale and really without any true emotions or feelings in their characters during the movie.

1164880,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B0019X3YWS,RMurray847,"[5, 6]","SHUTTER is the sort of film on which I'll spend more time writing this review than I did actually thinking about the movie after it was over.  Its goals are so mundane and modest.  Its efforts to reach that goal are equally modest.  It diverts the viewer for its 85 minute running time, but when it's over, you spend virtually no time with your viewing companions discussing it.  One hour later, you've practically forgotten you've seen it.SHUTTER is another one of those films set in Japan with creepy spirits in the form of young Japanese girls.  (see THE GRUDGE, original RING movies, etc.)  At least in this case, the ghost is modern and specific.  It doesn't change forms or appear to be various other spooky things.  (Remember how in THE GRUDGE, there were many different manifestations to confuse things?)The story follows a newly married couple who move to Japan so the husband (Joshua Jackson) can continue his work as a commercial photographer.  They do take a couple of days to have a brief honeymoon, and on the drive to their cabin, the young wife (played by Rachel Taylor, whose only previous work with which I'm familiar was a small part in TRANSFORMERS) crashes into a young woman standing in the middle of the road in her nightgown.  From this point on, ""unexplainable"" things begin to happen...though most of them revolve around strange images of this girl appearing on every photo the couple takes (or has taken).  It's a ""spirit photograph"" we're told.  (Apparently these are a fascinating subject in Japan, with entire magazines dedicated to their depiction and discussion.  At least, that's what SHUTTER wants us to believe...I have no idea if it is true, but I am skeptical of anything this film offers about Japanese culture.)The young bride is pretty much left to her own devices because hubby Jackson has to plunge into his grueling work of photographing beautiful models while his lovely young ""assistants"" paw inappropriately all over him.  The couple lives in a loft apartment connected to the studio, but it is a hideously ugly dump (despite the couple's ""ooohing"" and ""aahing"" all over it).  So Taylor heads out into the city, and to the film's credit, we get a good sense of how foreign a young, tall, blonde American woman with no Japanese skills would feel in this gigantic, bustling city.  Taylor is like the vapid, superficial version of Scarlett Johanssen's character in LOST IN TRANSLATION  (how's that for a shout-out you didn't expect).As Taylor digs deeper into the source of her spirit photos and the odd accident she was in...the truth about some American men behaving very badly in Japan begins to sink in, and she finds herself almost on the side of the spirit.  This is a twist on what we usually expect in ""vengeful spirit"" movies, and again, I give the film a little credit for this.What the film lacks, however, are any real chills.  We're SO accustomed to these kinds of mild, PG-13 horror flicks now that it fails to build any tension.  There are a couple of very brief ""gross-out"" killings, but other than that, this film is more about atmosphere rather than jump-out-of-your-seat thrills.  That would be okay, except such a film would then require more thoughtful characterizations than SHUTTER delivers.  It would also require good performances.  Jackson is totally unbelievable either as a professional photographer, or a loving husband or even as a cad.  Taylor shows moments of spunk, but mostly is asked to mope around.  And special mention goes to John Hensley, who has managed to absolutely bug the crap out of me in NIP/TUCK for 5 years (he plays the irritating, stupid and hard to look at son Matt).  He's equally reprehensible here.  Normally, I try to be kind about physical appearance...but Mr. Hensley is the least attractive young man working in films/TV today.So I cannot recommend SHUTTER, even on a modest level.  It is forgettable in every respect.  Maybe on a slow day at the video store, you can rent it.

1164881,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B0019X3YWS,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[7, 7]","Shutter (Masayuki Ochiai, 2008)You know, it's funny reading IMDB commentary on remakes of Asian horror films; it often seems like half the commenters are unaware the movie is a remake, and the other half are attacking the movie for things that are identical to the original film and talking about how bad they're messed up in the remake. It makes you wonder if anyone has seen either version. Well, I have. Both of them, in fact. And for an American remake, Shutter is actually not awful. Like most American remakes of Asian horror films, however, it is entirely unnecessary.Ochiai, whose last film was the highly underrated Infection, comes eastward to direct this remake of the 2004 Thai film of the same name. In this version, which is relatively faithful to the original, a photographer named Ben Shaw (Fringe's Joshua Jackson) and his new wife (Transformers' Rachael Taylor) go back to Ben's old stomping grounds in Tokyo for Ben to take a photography assignment. On the way to the cabin where they're going to spend their honeymoon, Jane sees a woman in the middle of the road and hits her. When the police come, however, they can find no trace of her. Soon she starts turning up in every photograph the two of them take, and Jane realizes she has to figure out who the woman is and why she's stalking them before things turn fatal.Ochiai is a very competent director, as Infection showed, and unlike many imported directors, being in Hollywood seems to have done nothing to suppress his abilities; Shutter is a well-executed movie in almost every regard. (There will be some scenes that people who have seen the original will understand better than people who didn't; the movie's shorter running time is to blame, given that otherwise the film is almost slavishly faithful, save a change of location and a change in the ethnicity of the main characters.) The only problem? Trying to figure out why Roy Lee, the entrepreneur behind at least a quarter of the remakes (both Asian and non-) to come out of Hollywood in the seven years since the Ring remake, persists in not understanding that simply releasing the Asian films theatrically in America will make him just as much money. Probably more, given that in most cases, the original films are far better than the remakes. (And yet when we do get foreign horror films theatrically released in America, we get such overrated and undertalented crap as Haute Tension, one of the worst movies of the past decade, and Darkness.) Sure, there's the small subset of the moviegoing populace who won't sit still for subtitles. (That's why there were so many dubbed films in the seventies; really, you could release it both ways, given how many movies play on multiple screens in the same theatre these days, and let the customer choose.) But just skimming the reviews for these movies, and reading what people have to say about them on message boards all over the Internet, should be telegraphing to Roy Lee and his compatriots that most of us would much rather have a chance to see the originals on the big screen. And really, are you going to tell me the twenty-five mil Shutter made in America during its theatrical run even came close to covering production costs?Please, sir, just give us the originals. I bet you'd make a lot more money that way, and really, isn't that what you're all about? Masayuki Ochiai could have been working on another movie all this time, and it would probably have been better. **",2,"Closest American remake to an Asian original since Ring, but still lacks the atmosphere to pull this off.",1238371200,"03 30, 2009",2009,3460,"['Shutter', 'Masayuki', 'Ochiai', '2008', 'know', 'funny', 'reading', 'IMDB', 'commentary', 'remakes', 'Asian', 'horror', 'films', 'often', 'commenters', 'are', 'unaware', 'movie', 'remake', 'other', 'half', 'are', 'attacking', 'movie', 'things', 'are', 'identical', 'original', 'film', 'talking', 'how', 'bad', ""'re"", 'messed', 'up', 'remake', 'wonder', 'anyone', 'seen', 'version', 'Well', 'have', 'fact', 'American', 'remake', 'Shutter', 'actually', 'not', 'awful', 'most', 'American', 'remakes', 'Asian', 'horror', 'films', 'however', 'entirely', 'unnecessary.Ochiai', 'last', 'film', 'was', 'highly', 'underrated', 'Infection', 'eastward', 'direct', 'remake', '2004', 'Thai', 'film', 'same', 'name', 'version', 'relatively', 'faithful', 'original', 'photographer', 'named', 'Ben', 'Shaw', 'Fringe', 'Joshua', 'Jackson', 'new', 'wife', 'Transformers', 'Rachael', 'Taylor', 'go', 'back', 'Ben', 'old', 'stomping', 'grounds', 'Tokyo', 'Ben', 'take', 'photography', 'assignment', 'way', 'cabin', 'where', ""'re"", 'going', 'spend', 'honeymoon', 'Jane', 'woman', 'middle', 'road', 'When', 'police', 'come', 'however', 'can', 'find', 'trace', 'Soon', 'turning', 'up', 'photograph', 'two', 'take', 'Jane', 'figure', 'out', 'who', 'woman', 'why', 'stalking', 'things', 'turn', 'fatal.Ochiai', 'very', 'competent', 'director', 'Infection', 'showed', 'many', 'imported', 'directors', 'being', 'Hollywood', 'have', 'done', 'nothing', 'suppress', 'abilities', 'Shutter', 'well-executed', 'movie', 'almost', 'regard', 'will', 'be', 'scenes', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'seen', 'original', 'will', 'understand', 'better', 'people', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'movie', 'shorter', 'running', 'time', 'blame', 'given', 'otherwise', 'film', 'almost', 'slavishly', 'faithful', 'save', 'change', 'location', 'change', 'ethnicity', 'main', 'characters', 'only', 'problem', 'Trying', 'figure', 'out', 'why', 'Roy', 'Lee', 'entrepreneur', 'least', 'quarter', 'remakes', 'Asian', 'non-', 'come', 'Hollywood', 'seven', 'years', 'Ring', 'remake', 'persists', 'not', 'understanding', 'simply', 'releasing', 'Asian', 'films', 'theatrically', 'America', 'will', 'make', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'money', 'Probably', 'more', 'given', 'most', 'cases', 'original', 'films', 'are', 'far', 'better', 'remakes', 'yet', 'when', 'do', 'get', 'foreign', 'horror', 'films', 'theatrically', 'released', 'America', 'get', 'such', 'overrated', 'undertalented', 'crap', 'Haute', 'Tension', 'one', 'worst', 'movies', 'past', 'decade', 'Darkness', 'Sure', 'small', 'subset', 'moviegoing', 'populace', 'who', 'wo', ""n't"", 'sit', 'still', 'subtitles', 'why', 'were', 'so', 'many', 'dubbed', 'films', 'seventies', 'really', 'could', 'release', 'ways', 'given', 'how', 'many', 'movies', 'play', 'multiple', 'screens', 'same', 'days', 'let', 'customer', 'choose', 'just', 'skimming', 'reviews', 'movies', 'reading', 'what', 'people', 'have', 'say', 'message', 'boards', 'Internet', 'should', 'be', 'telegraphing', 'Roy', 'Lee', 'compatriots', 'most', 'would', 'much', 'rather', 'have', 'chance', 'see', 'originals', 'big', 'screen', 'really', 'are', 'going', 'tell', 'twenty-five', 'mil', 'Shutter', 'made', 'America', 'theatrical', 'run', 'even', 'came', 'close', 'covering', 'production', 'costs', 'Please', 'sir', 'just', 'give', 'originals', 'bet', ""'d"", 'make', 'lot', 'more', 'money', 'way', 'really', ""n't"", 'what', ""'re"", 'Masayuki', 'Ochiai', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'working', 'movie', 'time', 'would', 'probably', 'have', 'been', 'better', '**']",N/A

Soon, the victim - the obligatory pasty-faced, stringy-haired brunette in a nightie - is haunting the couple's pictures in the form of a ""spirit photo,"" first hanging around the edges of the images, then - when the novelty of that wears off - appearing to the couple in corporeal form, and generally making a first-class nuisance of herself.As thrillers go, there are more shutters than shudders in this slick Hollywood remake of a well-received Thai film from 2004.  The storyline and imagery in this version are so reminiscent of other films in the genre that I kept feeling, as I was watching it, that I had seen this exact same movie before (and, no, I haven`t seen the original).  The derivative nature of the film hampers our enjoyment of even the few moderately suspenseful scenes director Masayuki Ochiai has been able to wring out of this shopworn material.

Perhaps that's just because we have seen so much of it before in those two previous movies. Or perhaps that's because the effects themselves aren't quite as inventive or as creepily cowled.However this movie has a cleaner storyline than ""The Grudge"" or ""The Ring."" It has some of the elements of a classic Agatha Christie mystery in that the clues to its resolution are all there, for anyone who doesn't ignore them as incidental to the action.And even though ""Shutter"" doesn't deliver quite the on-going frights we've come to expect from thrillers involving Japanese producers/directors - its manifestations all add up to a resolution that's a real shocker. The final images and their imports are bound to haunt you long after the ""Shutter"" has closed.There is also good scenery here. Although the lead actors are American and the movie is in English, most of the action takes place in Japan. You get to see a lot of everyday Japan, the ordinary streets and offices that you probably wouldn't get to see as a tourist. In some ways, this movie puts you there even more vividly than ""Lost in Translation"" did.The bonus material on the DVD is spread over both sides of the disc, and includes a brief history of ""spirit photography."" Capturing errant shafts of light on film and interpreting them as the hovering spirits of the dead was quite a craze during the Victorian period. Producing and selling such images remains a going industry in Japan to this day, according to the DVD history.The commentator on one of these bonus fragments says that making an effective thriller is like strapping viewers into a roller-coaster seat. You want to create music and special effects that act like the click-click-click of the coaster's wheels on its tracks as it climbs, climbs - carrying the captive viewer to the top of an incline. Those clicks clench them in anticipation of the oncoming plunge over the top into the abyss.

I THINK WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THE AMERICAN RE-MAKE HAPPENS, BESIDES THE RING AND THE GRUDGE WHICH I THINK HELD IT'S SPOOKY NATURE, BUT WITH THE EYE, RING 2, GRUDGE 2 AND ALSO THIS ONE THEY LOST THAT CREEPY JAPANESE FEEL TO THEM. THIS MOVIE IS BORING AND TO LONG. ONLY THREE MOMENTS STOOD OUT IN THE WHOLE MOVIE AND REALLY THEY COULD NOT EVEN SAVE THIS PUSHED TOGETHER PILE OF USELESS CINEMA.THERE IS A REALLY COOL SHOT OF A FLY CRAWLING UNDERNEATH THE SKIN AND IT COMES OUT THE EYE. ANOTHER SHOT A FRENCH KISS FROM HELL WITH A DECAYING TONGUE WAS A GREAT OVER THE TOP MOMENT. ALSO A SHOT OF A DECAYING GHOST WANTING TO HAVE SEX WORKED IN A VERY ODD WAY.THIS MOVIE HAS NO REAL BASIS TO EVEN WANT TO BE WATCHED. IF YOU'RE A DIE HARD FAN OF JOSHUA JACKSON THEN GIVE IT AGO, HIS PERFORMANCE WAS VERY WELL ACTED AND BROUGHT THE MOVIE TOGETHER. RACHAEL TAYLOR IS HOT AND IS NOT BAD TO LOOK AT AND THAT IS ANOTHER APPEAL TO THIS PLASTIC LOOKING MOVIE, IT'S BEAUTIFULLY SHOT. THE IMAGES AND PLACES CAPTURED BY THE CAMERA LENS BRINGS OUT A LIVING ARTISTIC BEAUTY THAT YOU SEE IN MOST JAPANESE FILMS. I ENJOYED WATCHING THIS JUST TO SAY I WATCHED IT AND WAS ABLE TO TELL OTHERS THAT IT'S REALLY NOT WORTH THE TWO FIFTY TO RENT IT OR NETFLIX IT. I SAY GIVE IT AGO IF IT'S ON CABLE BUT OTHER THEN THAT A PURE WASTE OF MONEY.DO YOURSELF A HUGE FAVOR, AVOID THIS ONE AND WATCH THE ORIGINAL WHICH IS A HUNDRED TIMES BETTER THEN THIS ONE AND IS A GOOD SPOOK WATCH.",2,poop,1216598400,"07 21, 2008",2008,2378,"['THINK', 'WHOLE', 'APPEAL', 'TO', 'THE', 'JAPANESE', 'GHOST', 'STORY', 'IS', 'DEAD', 'LIKED', 'RING', 'LIKED', 'GRUDGE', 'BUT', 'AFTER', 'THAT', 'REALLY', 'CA', ""N'T"", 'TAKE', 'ANYMORE', 'CONCEPT', 'IS', 'DEAD', 'IS', 'BEEN', 'PLAYED', 'OVER', 'AND', 'OVER', 'AND', 'OVER', 'AGAIN', 'TO', 'THE', 'POINT', 'IT', 'NOT', 'SCARY', 'ANYMORE.SHUTTER', 'IS', 'ANOTHER', 'REMAKE', 'A', 'JAPANESE', 'FILM', 'THIS', 'TIME', 'THE', 'SPOOKY', 'WHITE', 'JAPANESE', 'GHOST', 'GIRL', 'IS', 'HAUNTING', 'THE', 'CAMERA', 'HER', 'DEATH', 'IMAGE', 'IS', 'CAPTURED', 'IN', 'FILM', 'EVERY', 'TIME', 'PHOTOGRAPHER', 'BENJAMIN', 'SHAW', 'JOSHUA', 'JACKSON', 'TAKES', 'PICTURE', 'NEWLY', 'WEDS', 'JANE', 'AND', 'BENJAMIN', 'MOVE', 'TO', 'JAPAN', 'FOR', 'BENJAMIN', 'CAREER', 'THERE', 'JANE', 'STARTS', 'TO', 'SEE', 'IMAGES', 'A', 'GIRL', 'NO', 'THIS', 'NOT', 'A', 'LESBIAN', 'FANTASY', 'ALTHOUGH', 'THIS', 'MOVIE', 'WOULD', 'HAVE', 'BEEN', 'A', 'WHOLE', 'HELL', 'A', 'LOT', 'BETTER', 'WITH', 'A', 'SHOT', 'OF', 'GIRL', 'ON', 'GIRL', 'ACTION', 'BUT', 'INSTEAD', 'YOU', 'GET', 'THE', 'BASIC', 'LOOK', 'AT', 'ME', 'AM', 'GHOST', 'THAT', 'MOVES', 'REAL', 'FAST', 'AND', 'APPEARS', 'OUT', 'OF', 'NOWHERE', 'JANE', 'EXPLORES', 'SHE', 'COMES', 'TO', 'FIND', 'OUT', 'A', 'GREAT', 'MYSTERY', 'AND', 'CRIME', 'THAT', 'TAKEN', 'PLACE.THE', 'MOVIE', 'IS', 'VERY', 'SLOW', 'PACED', 'THINK', 'WHAT', 'WHEN', 'AMERICAN', 'RE-MAKE', 'HAPPENS', 'BESIDES', 'THE', 'RING', 'AND', 'THE', 'GRUDGE', 'WHICH', 'THINK', 'HELD', 'IT', 'SPOOKY', 'NATURE', 'BUT', 'WITH', 'THE', 'EYE', 'RING', '2', 'GRUDGE', '2', 'AND', 'ALSO', 'THIS', 'ONE', 'THEY', 'LOST', 'THAT', 'CREEPY', 'JAPANESE', 'FEEL', 'TO', 'THEM', 'THIS', 'MOVIE', 'IS', 'BORING', 'AND', 'TO', 'LONG', 'ONLY', 'THREE', 'MOMENTS', 'STOOD', 'OUT', 'IN', 'THE', 'WHOLE', 'MOVIE', 'AND', 'REALLY', 'THEY', 'COULD', 'NOT', 'EVEN', 'SAVE', 'THIS', 'PUSHED', 'TOGETHER', 'PILE', 'OF', 'USELESS', 'CINEMA.THERE', 'A', 'REALLY', 'COOL', 'SHOT', 'A', 'FLY', 'CRAWLING', 'UNDERNEATH', 'THE', 'SKIN', 'AND', 'IT', 'COMES', 'OUT', 'THE', 'EYE', 'ANOTHER', 'SHOT', 'A', 'FRENCH', 'KISS', 'FROM', 'HELL', 'WITH', 'A', 'DECAYING', 'TONGUE', 'WAS', 'A', 'GREAT', 'THE', 'TOP', 'MOMENT', 'ALSO', 'SHOT', 'A', 'DECAYING', 'GHOST', 'WANTING', 'TO', 'HAVE', 'SEX', 'WORKED', 'IN', 'A', 'VERY', 'ODD', 'WAY.THIS', 'MOVIE', 'HAS', 'NO', 'REAL', 'BASIS', 'TO', 'EVEN', 'WANT', 'TO', 'BE', 'WATCHED', 'IF', 'YOU', ""'RE"", 'A', 'DIE', 'HARD', 'FAN', 'OF', 'JOSHUA', 'JACKSON', 'THEN', 'GIVE', 'IT', 'AGO', 'HIS', 'PERFORMANCE', 'WAS', 'VERY', 'WELL', 'ACTED', 'AND', 'BROUGHT', 'THE', 'MOVIE', 'TOGETHER', 'RACHAEL', 'TAYLOR', 'IS', 'HOT', 'AND', 'IS', 'NOT', 'BAD', 'TO', 'LOOK', 'AT', 'AND', 'THAT', 'ANOTHER', 'APPEAL', 'TO', 'THIS', 'PLASTIC', 'LOOKING', 'MOVIE', 'IT', 'BEAUTIFULLY', 'SHOT', 'THE', 'IMAGES', 'AND', 'PLACES', 'CAPTURED', 'BY', 'THE', 'CAMERA', 'LENS', 'BRINGS', 'OUT', 'A', 'LIVING', 'ARTISTIC', 'BEAUTY', 'THAT', 'YOU', 'SEE', 'IN', 'MOST', 'JAPANESE', 'FILMS', 'ENJOYED', 'THIS', 'JUST', 'TO', 'SAY', 'WATCHED', 'IT', 'AND', 'WAS', 'ABLE', 'TO', 'TELL', 'OTHERS', 'IT', 'REALLY', 'NOT', 'WORTH', 'THE', 'TWO', 'FIFTY', 'TO', 'RENT', 'IT', 'OR', 'NETFLIX', 'IT', 'SAY', 'GIVE', 'IT', 'AGO', 'IF', 'IT', 'ON', 'CABLE', 'BUT', 'OTHER', 'THEN', 'A', 'PURE', 'WASTE', 'OF', 'MONEY.DO', 'YOURSELF', 'A', 'HUGE', 'FAVOR', 'AVOID', 'THIS', 'ONE', 'AND', 'WATCH', 'THE', 'ORIGINAL', 'WHICH', 'A', 'HUNDRED', 'TIMES', 'BETTER', 'THEN', 'THIS', 'ONE', 'AND', 'A', 'GOOD', 'SPOOK', 'WATCH']",N/A

In an attempt to bring some films to English Cinema, the concepts are transposed entirely, sometimes in part.The Camera of a New York native photographer who is now working in Japan starts to capture the image of the ""ghost"". The wife is the prime vehicle for seeing the ghosts, and as stated in many of the DVD features ( Commentary etc) the Wife is the way the audience is supposed to see the events and experience the Japanese culture. As I have stated in other reviews, the unrated version has again proven itself to be the de-facto gold standard, since this is a gem of a scare, which supposedly differs from the cinematic piece. It is really not clear if this is  the case, and it is just a subjective judgement, but the film seems to suffer to some degree from a non-english speaking Director, especially in the dialogue scenes, but it is clear from the Features that he brings a wealth of spooky experience to the non-verbal material, and it is why this material stands out so very well. It is to this end that the latter part of the film ( past 45 minutes) starts to pick up speed from non-verbal material and where the Director has taken some scenes from the original.THE DVD:Great Commentary.

And these modern day scary movies are broken into 2 types; a derranged killer going on a killing spree, or a ghost coming to haunt.This type of movie(which Shutter is) usually associates the dead with some gadget that we take for granted. Throw in some shots of adrenaline, and then you're ready for the silver screen. In essence, this is what Shutter is.The plot follows the straight, narrow, and boring line of what I've explained. Two newly weds get tarrorized by a dead girl in Tokeyo for 90 minuets, add a strangly odd zombie-esque love scene and being french kissed by a slug(?), then that would be the high light real of Shutter.

1164892,A2UW83R0JOZZ6,B0019X3YWS,S. Schell,"[0, 1]","Remaking Japanese horror movies seems to be the latest filmmaking trend these days and ""Shutter"" is no exception to the rule.  The Japanese are a highly superstitious people concerning the paranormal and their fascination and/or reverence for it clearly comes across in their films.  To that degree, they are the leaders in the horror film genre and always manage to be more creepy and hair-raising than their American counterparts.  Filmmakers here in the States must've figured that out long ago and are seeking to profit from it.  It's a shame really, but then again, isn't imitation the sincerest form of flattery?  It must be, since so many of these Japanese filmmakers are sanctioning these remakes.Take for example the one that started it all: ""The Ring"", a horror film originally entitled ""Ringu"" by Hideo Nakata made in 1998.  Gore Verbinski remade it in 2002 and when comparing the two films, several shots were arranged in the very same manner and the art direction is curiously similar.  In the five years since then, ""The Grudge"", ""The Eye"", ""Dark Water"", ""Pulse"" and ""One Missed Call"" have all made appearances, their Americanized stories culled from their Japanese counterparts.  At first wildly popular, the Eastern horror juggernaut must be slowing down because ""Shutter"" made a modest $10.4 million it's opening weekend and a domestic gross of less than $26 million compared to the staggering box office of ""The Ring"" (domestic gross was $128.5 million).""Shutter"" begins with just-married couple Ben (Jackson) and Jane (Taylor) as they embark on their lives together into bustling Tokyo.  Ben's occupation as a fashion photographer moves them there (much the same as Charlotte's husband in ""Lost In Translation"") and while the couple are cutesy and affectionate, it ain't all sweetness and light - somebody's got a dark past and it's about to get unearthed in the creepiest manner possible.Ben and Jane's married life gets off to a rocky start.  As they are making their way on a dark wintry road on the outskirts of the city, an unidentified woman steps suddenly from the shadows in front of their vehicle and Jane slams on the brakes, fishtailing off the road and slamming head-on into a tree.  When both of them come to after passing out, there is no trace of the woman despite a police search and inquiries to local hospitals.  As they try to forget about what happened, images of the woman both in Jane's dreams and in her waking hours make it impossible, as do all sorts of photographs they have developed after the crash.  Every picture Jane or Ben takes contains paranormal imagery and convinced it is the girl that she saw in the road that night, they go to an expert in spirit photography to help analyze their photographs.  When given an unsatisfactory answer, Jane does some of her own sleuthing and armed with a Polaroid camera, she snapshots her way into a startling discovery with the guidance of the agitated specter.Jane links the spirit, Megumi Tanaka (Okina), with her husband and he admits to a long-ago relationship with Megumi that went horribly awry.  It isn't long after his confession that Megumi begins to haunt those she knew in life and people start to have strange ""accidents"" resulting in their deaths.  We think Megumi is simply a predator bent on destroying people who have wronged her but a character's words always come back to ""haunt"" us throughout the film: Why go to all that effort unless you have something to say?""Shutter"" may be predictable for that very reason (as many will speculate) but it's a cut-and-dry 90 minutes so you don't get strung along for too long with this been-done formula.

1164895,A3I69IXPTDVKQF,B0019X3YWS,Stephen B. O'Blenis,"[5, 5]","First off, the Shutter remake differed for me from other remakes of Asian horror in that, usually, by the time there is a remake I've seen the original.  I haven't seen the 2004 Shutter (for no reason beyond the fact that there's a lot of Asian horror DVDs out that aren't stocked where I live, and having to see them by buying from Amazon or someplace means it takes quite a while to catch up) so I'll just focus on this incarnation.I really didn't have high hopes for this, but it turned out better than I thought.  Its biggest weakness was that it took quite a while to get going, quite a while to start distinguishing itself from movies like the ""Grudge"" series, but once it did, it became highly effective.It focuses on a newly married American couple (played by Joshua Jackson and Rachel Taylor) who move to Japan, where the husband has landed a job with a high-profile photography agency.  It's actually a return for him, having worked there previously, and the first time for Taylor.  Shortly after arriving they're in a car accident in which Jane (Taylor) thinks they've struck a woman, who Ben (Jackson) has no recollection of seeing; police and paramedics who arrive on the scene can find no trace that this woman ever existed either.  Jane reluctantly accepts the theory that maybe she imagined the woman, but shortly thereafter, images begin to turn up in photographs Ben takes, and Jane becomes convinced the woman is haunting them.  This leads into the whole world of spirit photography, a phenomena by where ghosts and glimpses of other worlds are said to be occasionally (and often inadvertently) captured on film.The movie manages to tap into a different kind of scariness, in that it's one of the few examples of a successful 'melancholy' horror film.  It's sad not in an air of big moments of grand tragedy, but in a subtle and quiet way (although the last ten minutes or so definately raises the bar in dramatic, revelatory happenings).  This kind of mood is very hard to pull off, very easy to just become dull and depressing instead of moving and interesting.  It really only seemed to attain it in its latter portions, although knowing what I do about the ending makes me want to see it over again once it hits DVD, see if things early on can be seen in a different light.Shutter is well made for the most part, although there are unfortunate glitches.  For example, certain scenes are played very well by the cast whereas others, often featuring the same players, perhaps could have benefitted from a do-over.  Nothing terrible, and it's not as much of a hinderance as the fact that it took things so long to hit their stride.  For the first two thirds of the film it was good but not really anything more, picking up a lot in the last half-hour.  If it managed this just a little bit earlier it probably would have gotten a four-star rating, but I think I'll put it at three-and-a-half.  It was much better than people are saying, and, contrary to its reputation, isn't just copying all the same moves that something likeThe Ring (Widescreen Edition)so successfully made.  Its atmosphere is very different, but it works.  I'd reccommend giving this one a chance.",3,Three-And-A-Half Stars - Underrated Movie That's Quite Different Than Expected,1209427200,"04 29, 2008",2008,3188,"['First', 'off', 'Shutter', 'remake', 'differed', 'other', 'remakes', 'Asian', 'horror', 'usually', 'time', 'remake', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'original', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', '2004', 'Shutter', 'reason', 'fact', 'lot', 'Asian', 'horror', 'DVDs', 'are', ""n't"", 'stocked', 'where', 'live', 'having', 'see', 'buying', 'Amazon', 'someplace', 'quite', 'while', 'catch', 'up', 'so', ""'ll"", 'just', 'focus', 'incarnation.I', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'high', 'hopes', 'turned', 'out', 'better', 'thought', 'biggest', 'weakness', 'was', 'took', 'quite', 'while', 'get', 'going', 'quite', 'while', 'start', 'distinguishing', 'movies', 'Grudge', 'series', 'did', 'became', 'highly', 'effective.It', 'focuses', 'newly', 'married', 'American', 'couple', 'played', 'Joshua', 'Jackson', 'Rachel', 'Taylor', 'who', 'move', 'Japan', 'where', 'husband', 'landed', 'job', 'high-profile', 'photography', 'agency', 'actually', 'return', 'having', 'worked', 'previously', 'first', 'time', 'Taylor', 'Shortly', 'arriving', ""'re"", 'car', 'accident', 'Jane', 'Taylor', ""'ve"", 'struck', 'woman', 'who', 'Ben', 'Jackson', 'recollection', 'seeing', 'police', 'paramedics', 'who', 'arrive', 'scene', 'can', 'find', 'trace', 'woman', 'ever', 'existed', 'Jane', 'reluctantly', 'theory', 'maybe', 'imagined', 'woman', 'shortly', 'thereafter', 'images', 'begin', 'turn', 'up', 'photographs', 'Ben', 'Jane', 'becomes', 'convinced', 'woman', 'haunting', 'whole', 'world', 'spirit', 'photography', 'phenomena', 'where', 'ghosts', 'glimpses', 'other', 'worlds', 'are', 'said', 'be', 'occasionally', 'often', 'inadvertently', 'captured', 'film.The', 'movie', 'manages', 'tap', 'different', 'kind', 'scariness', 'one', 'few', 'examples', 'successful', ""'melancholy"", 'horror', 'film', 'sad', 'not', 'air', 'big', 'moments', 'grand', 'tragedy', 'subtle', 'quiet', 'way', 'last', 'ten', 'minutes', 'so', 'definately', 'bar', 'dramatic', 'revelatory', 'happenings', 'kind', 'mood', 'very', 'hard', 'pull', 'off', 'very', 'easy', 'just', 'become', 'dull', 'depressing', 'instead', 'moving', 'interesting', 'really', 'only', 'seemed', 'attain', 'latter', 'portions', 'knowing', 'what', 'do', 'ending', 'want', 'see', 'over', 'again', 'DVD', 'see', 'things', 'early', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'different', 'light.Shutter', 'well', 'made', 'most', 'part', 'are', 'unfortunate', 'glitches', 'example', 'certain', 'scenes', 'are', 'played', 'very', 'well', 'cast', 'whereas', 'others', 'often', 'featuring', 'same', 'players', 'perhaps', 'could', 'have', 'benefitted', 'do-over', 'Nothing', 'terrible', 'not', 'as', 'much', 'hinderance', 'fact', 'took', 'things', 'so', 'long', 'hit', 'stride', 'first', 'two', 'thirds', 'film', 'was', 'good', 'not', 'really', 'anything', 'more', 'picking', 'up', 'lot', 'last', 'half-hour', 'managed', 'just', 'little', 'bit', 'earlier', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'gotten', 'four-star', 'rating', 'think', ""'ll"", 'put', 'three-and-a-half', 'was', 'much', 'better', 'people', 'are', 'saying', 'contrary', 'reputation', ""n't"", 'just', 'copying', 'same', 'moves', 'something', 'likeThe', 'Ring', 'Widescreen', 'Edition', 'so', 'successfully', 'made', 'atmosphere', 'very', 'different', ""'d"", 'reccommend', 'giving', 'one', 'chance']",N/A
1164896,AJN24TVEGZEI4,B0019X3YWS,Steve,"[0, 0]","This film is an OK remake of the original Thai version.  Yes the makeup is far better, in the American version, the budget is higher and the camera equipment is better and clearer, the movie is no where near as good as the original Thai movie.  While the movie is not horrible, it is not good either.. it is only good to watch on a bored rainy day when you have nothing better to do.  Ok, in defense of this movie, the ghost's makeup and design was far better than the Thai version, but her scares were pathetic in this version.The movie basically follows the same formula of all of the J-horror remakes that have flooded the American market and simply transplants a Thai couple with an American couple.  The storyline is almost identical, although the American version opted to replace a physically creepy confrontation with the ghost at the end of the Thai movie with quite a bizarre, borderline gross sex scene confrontation in this one.  Leave it to American cinema to replace intense creepyness with gross creepy sex.The differences between the original and the remake include...-This movie is predictable, original Thai version is not-Another grungy long haired chick chasing our protagonist, at least in the original she was creative in her scares-This one is far slower than the original, takes forever to get moving-Joshua Jackson is no better than the orginal actors, at least the the Thai actors feel more natural, and do not look forced-Run of the mill scares, Thai version really leaves you unnerved.. note to Amercian directors.. creepy sex scenes with mutant grungy chicks dont make a movie better.If you like Asian horror remakes definately check this movie out as it is not horrible.  But if you get a chance, I urge you to see the original one, as it will leave you creeped out and unsetteled, and will definately fulfill you horror needs.Are we going to ruin every Asian horror movie?? can we please leave some unscathed?",3,Review - Shutter,1309132800,"06 27, 2011",2011,1940,"['film', 'OK', 'remake', 'original', 'Thai', 'version', 'Yes', 'makeup', 'far', 'better', 'American', 'version', 'budget', 'higher', 'camera', 'equipment', 'better', 'clearer', 'movie', 'where', 'near', 'as', 'good', 'original', 'Thai', 'movie', 'movie', 'not', 'horrible', 'not', 'good', 'either..', 'only', 'good', 'watch', 'bored', 'rainy', 'day', 'when', 'have', 'nothing', 'better', 'do', 'Ok', 'defense', 'movie', 'ghost', 'makeup', 'design', 'was', 'far', 'better', 'Thai', 'version', 'scares', 'were', 'pathetic', 'version.The', 'movie', 'basically', 'same', 'formula', 'J-horror', 'remakes', 'have', 'flooded', 'American', 'market', 'simply', 'transplants', 'Thai', 'couple', 'American', 'couple', 'storyline', 'almost', 'identical', 'American', 'version', 'opted', 'replace', 'physically', 'creepy', 'confrontation', 'ghost', 'end', 'Thai', 'movie', 'bizarre', 'borderline', 'gross', 'sex', 'scene', 'confrontation', 'one', 'Leave', 'American', 'cinema', 'replace', 'intense', 'creepyness', 'gross', 'creepy', 'sex.The', 'differences', 'original', 'remake', 'include', '-This', 'movie', 'predictable', 'original', 'Thai', 'version', 'not-Another', 'grungy', 'long', 'haired', 'chick', 'chasing', 'protagonist', 'least', 'original', 'was', 'creative', 'scares-This', 'one', 'far', 'slower', 'original', 'forever', 'get', 'moving-Joshua', 'Jackson', 'better', 'orginal', 'actors', 'least', 'Thai', 'actors', 'feel', 'more', 'natural', 'do', 'not', 'look', 'forced-Run', 'mill', 'Thai', 'version', 'really', 'unnerved..', 'note', 'Amercian', 'directors..', 'creepy', 'sex', 'scenes', 'mutant', 'grungy', 'chicks', 'dont', 'make', 'movie', 'better.If', 'Asian', 'horror', 'remakes', 'definately', 'check', 'movie', 'out', 'not', 'horrible', 'get', 'chance', 'urge', 'see', 'original', 'one', 'will', 'leave', 'creeped', 'out', 'unsetteled', 'will', 'definately', 'fulfill', 'needs.Are', 'going', 'ruin', 'Asian', 'horror', 'movie', 'can', 'please', 'leave', 'unscathed']",N/A

1164898,AZCDCO6KK2T81,B0019X3YWS,"Steven Hedge ""Movie Fan""","[32, 44]","you may die laughing at what these filmmakers consider scary.  What is scary is that anyone kept a straight face while filming this latest Asian influenced horror film.**This review may contain some minor spoilers**Simply put, with the focus on ""simply"", this is a tale of a newlywed couple that moves to Japan immediately after their wedding so that the husband, Ben Shaw (played by the wooden Canadian actor Joshua Jackson ofDawson's Creek), can accept a job as a high fashion photographer in a firm that is run by his buddies, Bruno and Adam, who quickly come off as both suspicious and somewhat seedy.  Of course, all these young men in this film are once again played with the stereotypical ""grunge"" look of 5 o'clock shadows and wrinkled suits with no ties and we are again expected to believe these young professionals are ""running"" a company in Japan which is a country and culture that is known for formality.Ben's wife, Jane (boringly played by Rachael Taylor fromTransformerswho was the British computer geek) is onto this quickly, but says nothing.  In fact, her blank expression is the best one she has as an actress and only gives us a small snapshot of her ""acting"" ability near the end of the film.  She is just a blank slate throughout most of this film and that is only part her fault as her director should have demanded more of her or he should have given her more guidance, but then again, the script is tremendously at fault as well and speaking of which . . .On route to their honeymoon spot in Japan, Jane runs over a woman standing in the middle of the road to which her loving and compassionate husband eventually responds with ""Don't let something like this ruin our honeymoon.""  He follows that up with ""She's probably fine"" since she didn't stick around --even though BOTH the front and back tires rolled over her, bouncing the car like crazy into a ditch.  I kid you not.  These lines were said; they are direct quotes from this incredible unbelievable and hugely unintentionally funny Asian influenced horror yarn that is beyond cliche-ridden.After this ""tragic"" event that is nothing more than a blip on their radar scope, Jane ""sees"" the ghost of this woman she ran over in her husband's photographs, in misty images, and in reflections all over the place.  So does her husband who seems to want to keep it all to himself and make his wife believe she is nuts as he's crawling around on the floor while attempting to allude this ghost in a sensationally and unintentionally funny moment that is followed up with a ""Hi dear"" when his wife discovers this episode.  This film is filled with moments like this and I can't help but point out another one in which Ben takes a photograph of himself that includes the ghost . . . not kidding now . . . sitting on his shoulders and he runs around trying to get her off.  Only Jim Carey could have done this moment funnier.  I, my whole family, and the entire theater I watched this film in was dying with laughter.  This is a horror film??????Now add to this that the Japanese ghost easily reminds one of the ghost inThe Grudgeand that film has, unfortunately, been parodied to death.  In fact, there is nearly nothing original in this film that copies almost every Asian horror flick known to man.  Combine that with lackluster, nearly boring, acting by all involved, tiresome overused special effects, pedestrian direction and you get a film that is a real failure.

The same scare tactics, the same visual effects, even the same actors! Megumi Okina, who played in main character in Ju-on, portrays the ghostly character in this film. Except for a few, very minor twists, anyone who's seen The Ring, The Grudge, One Missed Call, etc.. can see what's coming a mile away. Not to stay that the overall story or plot is actually bad, but as far as originality goes, this film doesn't even really come close. The acting, which isn't amazing, isn't horrible either. However, I gotta say that Joshua Jackson performances can just be plain boring or lethargic at times. In closing, this film might be a hit with someone who's new to this kind of genre, and who knows, if this movie had been made before a few of these other Asian horror flicks were made, I might be a bit impressed, cause again, this isn't bad of a film.

Sipos,"[4, 5]","I don't see how any hardcore horror fan could NOT have seen every plot point coming.This may contain spoilers, but not really, since it's all predictable.SHUTTER begins with a young couple running over a woman.  I assumed right off that bat that the car victim was a ghost.  Minutes later, they can't find the body.  At this point, EVERY VIEWER should KNOW for certain that it was a ghost.Yet the film spends about an hour, with ""spooky"" happenings while the wife investigates, before we ""learn"" that -- the car victim was already dead! -- she must have been a ghost!!!It was also obvious to me, way early one, that the ghost had met with foul play -- at the hands of hubby and his friends.  And sure enough, the final ""twist"" is that the wife learns that hubby helped rape the woman and drove her to suicide.What made THE RING remake so great was that it turned such ghost conventions on its head.  Normally, the ghost stops haunting once mortals discover its body or learns its secrets.  That didn't happen in THE RING.But SHUTTER is no RING.  SHUTTER does have some nice (albeit stylistically derivative of THE GRUDGE) cinematography.

Sometimes it happens when recorded sounds, sometimes through mediums, and sometimes through spirit pictures. What are spirit pictures, you might ask (such the good question, too)? Briefly, they are proof of the other side showcased in photographs. Blurs, faces, entire people; appearances showcase how emotions never die.And, in the movie Shutter, that is exactly what we have.Instead of giving you a summary of all the plotpoints that are covered in the editorial and in other people's reviews, I'll focus on the low point that this movie was. Taken from a great foreign movie (that you SHOULD watch), this remake misses a lot what was originally there and Westernizes it. It makes the mistake that many other Western titles have made while doing this: there is a lot of emphasis placed on moments that make you jump and there is a lot of emphasis placed on special effects. Still, the thing that made the movie great, the storyline itself, is dumbed down and given to you on a platter. That, combined with a lack of believable acting, made the movie yet another remake yawner.If you want to see Shutter, go and get the foreign edition. It has everything you want and, like the movie Pulse, it is presented in a fashion that doesn't make your finger edge toward fast-forward. I'm not saying this because I have anything against remakes, horror, B-movies, or adaptations: quite the contrary, in fact.

1164903,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B0019X3YWS,Tsuyoshi,"[1, 2]","""Shutter"" (2008) remake of Thai horror film of the same name made in 2004, is a typical case of a Hollywood studio meddling with the production. The story of the newly-weds, American photographer Ben (Joshua Jackson) and Jane (Rachel Taylor), haunted by a female ""yurei"" during their honeymoon in Japan could have been a unique take of a ghost story. Instead, what you get here is a very boring film with its first half going on and on forever, and some effective twists and turns that happen too late.As to the plot of the film, please read the reviews of the original Thai film. Without giving away any spoilers, I only add that according to the interview with director Masayuki Ochiai (which I found in a pamphlet I bought at theater in Japan), he insisted that Ben and Jane should NOT call the police after one significant event that happens early in the film, but the studio refused it, saying no American audiences would relate to the protagonists acting like that.It is a big mistake, because by doing so, the sense of guilt that was essential to the original story is gone, making the subsequent development of the plot pointless. Ochiai tries his best, using set-pieces involving scares and deaths, but most of them look random and disconnected, even sometimes unintentionally funny, making the process of finding the horrible truths less convincing and shocking.The remake has better production designs and better cinematography tahn the original. And Megumi Okina plays the creepy yurei (you know what I mean) which is pretty impressive.

Mason ""Robinson Mason""","[4, 5]","First off, unless I'm mistaken, this is a remake of a movie from Thailand -- so I was a bit surprised when it ended up becoming a sort of Japanese-Hollywood hybrid.Of course, the whole concept fits very well with the Grudge-like Japanese genre, and the Thai version was likely also inspired by that sub-genre of horror, so in the end that's beside the point.  I just felt the need to question whether this is ""just another J-Horror crossover"".Anyway, having lived in Japan for nearly a decade, I found this one hit very close to home and was authentic and believeable.Compare to a show like Heroes that uses Japanese-Americans and Korean-Americans pretending to be Japanese with awful accents - or reading clocks with Kanji digits... well, let's just say it was nice to see some real Japanese actors who weren't playing to American stereotypes.See, I knew more than a couple of American guys who dated Japanese women, and stories of the Japanese girlfriend who refused to say goodbye -- often bordering on the creepy stalkerish type -- were not rare.Something about being a Gaijin and the way Japanese relationships are rarely as casual at their core makes the girlfriend who could not say goodbye story ring very true here.I also knew a few less than wholesome American guys there with awful reputations, and the ""ugly American"" in this movie likewise hits the nail on the head.These realistic, drawn-from-tales-of-experience background story elements make Shutter more than the typical watch the teens die one by one type of B flick, and made it very entertaining for me.  I also found it to be more realistic than the Grudge remake because of their less than pretty take of the American guy in Japan.If you are a guy (or girl) who lived in Japan for a while, you'll enjoy the authentic feel of this one.
