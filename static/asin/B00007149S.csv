He answers all the questions I always wanted to know (pre Jersey Girl) about the artist,actor, comic book and screen writer that is Kevin Smith. He talks about his movies (Clerks, Mallrats, Dogma, Chasing Amy), His  directing his ideas to screen. He talks about  his thoughts and insights of his film casts.  He is very open about his involvement in the Superman film he didn't do, about director Tim Burton, his relationship with film partner Jason Mewes (Jay) and how he met his wife-in graphic detail.What can i say? --Lets go to the wheel of adjectives....Candid, over the top, wickedly funny...Smith truly entertains.

723887,AE0E6UII0VSZA,B00007149S,Blake Kleiner,"[2, 2]","My admiration of Kevin Smith borders on worship. His unspeakably witty, scathing dialogue that rocket-propels his movies along is among the best ever written. But the one thing that everyone will point out is that 99.99999 (off into infinity)% of this dialogue is never for him, although he's been in all of his own films. Well, that's cuz Kevin Smith is Silent Bob (as if you didn't already know that). But when Silent Bob does speak, you see every eye in the theater open a bit wider, every ear perk up a bit. From his heartfelt monologue in &quot;Chasing Amy&quot; to the nugget of hilarity he let loose on the train in &quot;Dogma,&quot; Silent Bob, whether living up to his title or not, commands attention. That's why I was so excited for this DVD.Silent Bob speaks. For three and a half hours.I couldn't be happier. From beginning to end, the &quot;Evening With Kevin Smith&quot; DVD is a comic treasure. Visiting universities all over the country (Cornell, Clark, Indiana, Wyoming, Kent, etc.), Smith fields questions from all kinds of audience members about all aspects of his films. From the origin of the term &quot;snoogans&quot; and his friendship with Jason Mewes, all the way up to his first time with his wife and an unheard of Prince documentary, Silent Bob stands up and tells all. But sorry, folks, he doesn't dance.As far as the best stuff on this DVD is concerned, look for Smith's story about his stint on Superman, the story of how he met his wife, and the entire Q&amp;A at U of Wyoming, when he is joined by a special guest. This is just pure entertainment. Silent Bob does know how to talk, and he's as witty as he is intelligent. If you're a Kevin Smith fan, you have some buddies that are Smith fans, and a few hours to party and hang out, pick this up at your local video store, buy some beer and chips, then kick back and enjoy the musings of one of our most interesting filmmakers.",5,The only thing missing is dinner,1041984000,"01 8, 2003",2003,1912,"['admiration', 'Kevin', 'Smith', 'borders', 'worship', 'unspeakably', 'witty', 'scathing', 'dialogue', 'movies', 'best', 'ever', 'written', 'one', 'thing', 'everyone', 'will', 'point', 'out', '99.99999', 'infinity', '%', 'dialogue', 'never', 'been', 'own', 'films', 'Well', 'cuz', 'Kevin', 'Smith', 'Silent', 'Bob', 'did', ""n't"", 'already', 'know', 'when', 'Silent', 'Bob', 'speak', 'see', 'eye', 'theater', 'open', 'bit', 'wider', 'ear', 'up', 'bit', 'heartfelt', 'monologue', 'quot', 'Chasing', 'Amy', 'quot', 'nugget', 'hilarity', 'let', 'loose', 'train', 'quot', 'Dogma', 'quot', 'Silent', 'Bob', 'living', 'up', 'title', 'not', 'attention', 'why', 'was', 'so', 'excited', 'DVD.Silent', 'Bob', 'three', 'half', 'hours.I', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'happier', 'beginning', 'end', 'quot', 'Evening', 'Kevin', 'Smith', 'quot', 'DVD', 'comic', 'treasure', 'Visiting', 'universities', 'country', 'Cornell', 'Clark', 'Indiana', 'Wyoming', 'Kent', 'etc', 'Smith', 'fields', 'questions', 'kinds', 'audience', 'members', 'aspects', 'films', 'origin', 'term', 'quot', 'snoogans', 'quot', 'friendship', 'Jason', 'Mewes', 'way', 'first', 'time', 'wife', 'unheard', 'Prince', 'documentary', 'Silent', 'Bob', 'up', 'tells', 'sorry', 'folks', ""n't"", 'dance.As', 'far', 'best', 'stuff', 'DVD', 'concerned', 'look', 'Smith', 'story', 'stint', 'Superman', 'story', 'how', 'met', 'wife', 'entire', 'Q', 'amp', 'U', 'Wyoming', 'when', 'joined', 'special', 'guest', 'just', 'pure', 'entertainment', 'Silent', 'Bob', 'know', 'how', 'talk', 'as', 'witty', 'intelligent', ""'re"", 'Kevin', 'Smith', 'fan', 'have', 'buddies', 'are', 'Smith', 'fans', 'few', 'hours', 'party', 'hang', 'out', 'pick', 'up', 'local', 'video', 'store', 'buy', 'beer', 'chips', 'then', 'kick', 'back', 'enjoy', 'musings', 'one', 'most', 'interesting', 'filmmakers']",An Evening with Kevin Smith
723888,A11YV6VC51HJTV,B00007149S,"Blake Petit ""Novelist, columnist & reviewer""","[14, 19]","Fans of Kevin Smith have long known he does some of the most entertaining, informative commentaries you can get on a DVD. Well, look at this new two-disc set as being all commentary, and you won't be disappointed.Last year, film crews followed Smith as he made a tour of several college campuses, conducting his now-famous Q&amp;A lectures. Over the course of the two discs, Smith talks for two hours about his adventures in the film industry, his friendships, his marriage, his family -- you name it, he dishes the dirt. Have you ever wondered what happened to the script he wrote for a Superman movie some years ago? The story is here. Heard about the documentary he was going to make for Prince? It's here. Wonder how he met and fell in love with his wife? It's here too. And every minute of it is as entertaining as anything you've ever seen on DVD.Smith doesn't try to hog the spotlight -- Jason ""Jay"" Mewes joins him at one point, and he frequently engages audience members in conversations that elevate them almost to the level of co-stars. Smith isn't worried about burning bridges, either -- he dishes the dirt on a few people, but it's a few people he clearly never wants to deal with again. (Now if we could just get everybody else in Hollywood to make DVDs where they badmouth Producer Jon Peters, the world of film would be a better place.)As far as extras go... there's not much. (What did you expect, a commentary?) There are a few Easter Eggs spotlighting bonus moments from the tour. They're nice, but one wonders why they couldn't have just been included in the film itself. You get a few ""bonus trailers"" as well. My favorite ""extra"" though, such as it is, is the menus. Before you start the film on each disc, just watch the menus for a few minutes. They're hysterical.All in all, a really good DVD for fans of Kevin Smith. The rest of you probably won't get it anyway -- but you should. Check out his movies, then come back and watch this.",5,Great for the Kevin Smith fan,1042416000,"01 13, 2003",2003,1960,"['Fans', 'Kevin', 'Smith', 'have', 'long', 'known', 'most', 'entertaining', 'informative', 'commentaries', 'can', 'get', 'DVD', 'Well', 'look', 'new', 'two-disc', 'set', 'being', 'commentary', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed.Last', 'year', 'film', 'crews', 'followed', 'Smith', 'made', 'tour', 'several', 'college', 'campuses', 'conducting', 'now-famous', 'Q', 'amp', 'lectures', 'course', 'two', 'discs', 'Smith', 'talks', 'two', 'hours', 'adventures', 'film', 'industry', 'friendships', 'marriage', 'family', 'name', 'dirt', 'Have', 'ever', 'wondered', 'what', 'happened', 'script', 'wrote', 'Superman', 'movie', 'years', 'ago', 'story', 'here', 'Heard', 'documentary', 'was', 'going', 'make', 'Prince', 'here', 'Wonder', 'how', 'met', 'fell', 'love', 'wife', 'here', 'too', 'minute', 'as', 'entertaining', 'anything', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'DVD.Smith', ""n't"", 'try', 'hog', 'spotlight', 'Jason', 'Jay', 'Mewes', 'one', 'point', 'frequently', 'audience', 'members', 'conversations', 'elevate', 'almost', 'level', 'co-stars', 'Smith', ""n't"", 'worried', 'burning', 'bridges', 'dirt', 'few', 'people', 'few', 'people', 'clearly', 'never', 'deal', 'again', 'Now', 'could', 'just', 'get', 'everybody', 'else', 'Hollywood', 'make', 'DVDs', 'where', 'badmouth', 'Producer', 'Jon', 'Peters', 'world', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'place', 'As', 'far', 'extras', 'go', 'not', 'much', 'What', 'did', 'expect', 'commentary', 'are', 'few', 'Easter', 'Eggs', 'spotlighting', 'bonus', 'moments', 'tour', ""'re"", 'nice', 'one', 'wonders', 'why', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'just', 'been', 'included', 'film', 'get', 'few', 'bonus', 'trailers', 'as', 'well', 'My', 'favorite', 'extra', 'such', 'menus', 'start', 'film', 'disc', 'just', 'watch', 'menus', 'few', 'minutes', ""'re"", 'hysterical.All', 'really', 'good', 'DVD', 'fans', 'Kevin', 'Smith', 'rest', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'anyway', 'should', 'Check', 'out', 'movies', 'then', 'come', 'back', 'watch']",An Evening with Kevin Smith

Just see his comments on the director of Magnolia.)With a guest appearance by Jason &quot;Jay&quot; Mewes, phone calls to Scott Mosier and a fan's father (&quot;We think your son may be on the pot.&quot;), and hilarious tales at the expense of friend and actor Ben Affleck, this one may not be for the whole family, but you will be in stitches before it's over.",5,What's a Nubian?,1054771200,"06 5, 2003",2003,751,"['Ladies', 'Gents', 'own', 'Kevin', 'Smith', 'films', 'must', 'buy', 'set', 'Not', 'only', 'do', 'get', 'depth', 'insight', 'origins', 'movies', 'also', 'get', 'see', 'tales', 'what', 'backstage', 'hilarity', 'Hollywood', 'honesty', 'director', 'who', ""n't"", 'afraid', 'tell', 'know', 'oft', 'times', ""n't"", 'come', 'out', 'looking', 'too', 'good', 'Just', 'see', 'comments', 'director', 'Magnolia', 'guest', 'appearance', 'Jason', 'quot', 'Jay', 'quot', 'Mewes', 'phone', 'calls', 'Scott', 'Mosier', 'fan', 'father', 'quot', 'think', 'son', 'may', 'be', 'pot.', 'quot', 'hilarious', 'tales', 'expense', 'friend', 'actor', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'one', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'whole', 'family', 'will', 'be', 'stitches', 'over']",An Evening with Kevin Smith

723891,AZ5250G2U795I,B00007149S,C. K. Ogi,"[7, 8]","I was not a Kevin Smith Devotee, as most of his fans are.  I think he's a good director, and he has cranked out some great movies.  He does know how to write a good script as well.So, I was pleasantly surprised when I viewed this to find out really insightful and wise Kevin Smith is.  This documentary is a collection of snippets from a variety of college lectures he's done, but it doesn't feel choppy.  Smith clearly understands the film business and it's culture better than most people whove been in the industry for decades.  He fully admits exploiting it for what it's worth, but also manages to sidestep the pitfalls associated with ascent in Hollywood.  It's a truly eye-opening look into the world of modern day filmmaking and celebrity.I would also like to recommend this based on the fact that Smith is one of the best story tellers our society has.  He really has a gift for just starting a story, leaving no stone unturned, and just engaging you into what he's relating.  His story about writing the script for Superman will have you in tears.  Another good one is his encounter with Prince.  Smith has an easy-going, self-depricating style that's combined with a smart guy who LOVES the heck outta movies.This is definitely a good documentary that non-Kevin Smith fans will enjoy and get something from.

I don't take him seriously one way or the other (unlike David Gordon Green who accuses him of ""creating a Special Olympics for film,"" or the legions of his loyal followers who worship him), but I do appreciate his ability to write original, entertaining dialogues. Based on this DVD, he's quite a good storyteller too. He's witty, articulate, funny and full of interesting stories. I loved the behind-the-scene stories about his meeting with the studio execs, or run-ins with other celebs (such as Prince and Tim Burton), but rest of the stuff just fell flat. I guess the majority of his immature fans like to hear about the first time he had sex with his wife, or Jason Mewes' amateur sex tape, but I sure didn't find it even remotely interesting or funny.

723897,A2FEGRJQNU51P9,B00007149S,Joe Sherry,"[3, 3]","This is an odd little DVD. It is not a movie, nor is it a documentary. As the title would suggest, it is simple An Evening With Kevin Smith / Or, several evenings as the case may be.Kevin Smith is one of my favorite directors. This is not because he has the most skill or is a master of the craft, but rather because his movies are simply enjoyable to watch. With some directors, you can tell it is their work because of the camera work, or the lighting...but with Smith, you can close your eyes and tell that Smith wrote it. The language is distinctly his own and it always makes me laugh and even think a little. They are also highly quotable.As a fan of DVD, I enjoy the special features that are often put on the releases. One of my favorite features is the option to have a commentary track run over the movie so i can listen to the director (or someone) speak about the movie. You learn little tid bits about the film and making it. Some directors are not that interesting on commentary tracks (Rob Reiner on When Harry Met Sally was quite dull), but the man who gives consistently good and funny commentary is Kevin Smith. Smith is the director of Clerks , Mallrats , Chasing Amy , Dogma , and Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back . He had a short lived animated series Clerks Uncensored . He is currently filming Jersey Girl .Over the past several years, Kevin Smith has had speaking engagements at colleges and universities. The DVD covers several of those appearances. That might not sound too interesting to own or to watch, but Smith is consistently funny and always interesting, no matter what he is talking about.

Can you picture other legendary filmmakers holding your attention that long just talking? Spielberg? Doubt it. Lucas? Not a chance. Coppola? Only if he whipped up some pasta first.IN a way it's perhaps some new form of performance. It isn't stand up comedy. There are no routines, no fixed ""bits"". It isn't a dramatization. There's no real structure. It's not even improvization, such as Garrison Keillor manages to spin so skillfully week after week on Prairie Home Companion. It's basically just a very funny, witty, goofy guy talking and answering questions. That's about it. Yes, he tells stories and the writer in him makes them charming and amusing.

If you're profoundly enamored of Smith's movies, this selection of the best questions will probably be right up your street.  If you're even entertained by the movies, as I am, you'll probably see enough to hold your interest, and there are some interesting nuggets regarding filmmaking and filmmakers that will have broad audience appeal.However, for all but the most dedicated fans, what you're looking at here frequently descends into a lengthy parade of penis and fart jokes, trivial personal anecdotes, and rambling stories that only the most dedicated fans will be able to keep up with for any length of time.I'm sure the story of the first time he made love to his wife is profoundly interesting to Smith and his fans.  Ditto the story of his brief personal feud with Tim Burton or how Jason Mewes came up with his catch lines like ""Snoogens.""  But I'm an adult now, and calibrating penis stories or investigating the etymology of a baby-talk word just goes right past me like a shot.Dedicated View Askew fans will probably find more than enough material in this to keep them coming back.

Palmer,"[6, 7]","&quot;An Evening with Kevin Smith&quot; chronicles the college Q&amp;A tour that the director of five &quot;Jay and Silent Bob&quot; films took in 2001.  The DVD consists of 2 discs and contains almost 4 hours of vintage Smith discussing his life, his films and his comic book side career.I enjoyed several of the stories that Kevin tells. In particular, I found his discussion about his experience in the development of the ill-fated &quot;Superman Reborn&quot; project to be very intersting.  He spends almost 30 minutes discussing how he got involved with the project (his theory on why he was asked to work on it involves the dialogue that takes place in &quot;Mallrats&quot; about Superman's &quot;prowess&quot;).  He explains his meetings with movie execs, particularly Jon Peters (producer of &quot;Rainman), who he convincing portrays as a total goofball.  He also explains how his role in the development of the film fell apart when it was decided that Tim Burton would be the director.  Kevin leaves no doubt that there is no love lost between himself and Burton.I also enjoyed his long (again about 30 minutes) discussion about another ill-fated experience as the director of a documentary about the artist now known as Prince.  It's a fascinating discussion of what it is like to work with a man who lives in (as described by one of Prince's assistants), &quot;Prince World&quot;.  Kevin shows how he went from a giddy fan of Prince who was tickled to be asked to do the project to a non-fan who now could care less about Prince.I do have some quibbles.  Although he told the story with good humor, I really didn't care about the minute details of his first &quot;romantic&quot; experience with is wife Jen.  I'd say about 20 minutes are dedicated to this that could have been used to descibe his thoughts on one of his movies.  I'm not a prude (I've seen and enjoyed his movies, after all), but some things are better left unsaid (or at least left off the DVD).Obviously since these college stints were Q&amp;A sessions, he can only answer what was asked by the crowd.  However, I would have liked to have heard discussion on what it was like to work with Linda Fiorentino on &quot;Dogma&quot;, who he has said was so difficult to work with that he will never do it again.  If he could rip Prince and Jon Peters in an entertaining fashion, imagine the hatchet job he could have done on her.I also didn't understand why it was decided to leave in questions asked by students who were obviously not coherent and just babbled without saying anything pertinent.  Again, this time could have been spent showing Kevin answer decent questions.  I did get a kick out of Kevin's attempt to try to sweet talk an employer of a student to let him get his job back (the student was fired for going to the Smith show instead of working).Overall, pretty entertaining and a good addition for the Kevin Smith completest.",4,Some Great Stories About The View Askewniverse,1040601600,"12 23, 2002",2002,2916,"['quot', 'Evening', 'Kevin', 'Smith', 'quot', 'college', 'Q', 'amp', 'tour', 'director', 'five', 'quot', 'Jay', 'Silent', 'Bob', 'quot', 'films', 'took', '2001', 'DVD', '2', 'discs', 'almost', '4', 'hours', 'vintage', 'Smith', 'discussing', 'life', 'films', 'comic', 'book', 'side', 'career.I', 'enjoyed', 'several', 'stories', 'Kevin', 'particular', 'found', 'discussion', 'experience', 'development', 'ill-fated', 'quot', 'Superman', 'Reborn', 'quot', 'project', 'be', 'very', 'intersting', 'almost', '30', 'minutes', 'discussing', 'how', 'got', 'involved', 'project', 'theory', 'why', 'was', 'asked', 'work', 'dialogue', 'place', 'quot', 'Mallrats', 'quot', 'Superman', 'quot', 'quot', 'meetings', 'movie', 'execs', 'particularly', 'Jon', 'Peters', 'producer', 'quot', 'Rainman', 'who', 'convincing', 'portrays', 'total', 'goofball', 'also', 'how', 'role', 'development', 'film', 'fell', 'apart', 'when', 'was', 'decided', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'would', 'be', 'director', 'Kevin', 'doubt', 'love', 'lost', 'Burton.I', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'long', 'again', '30', 'minutes', 'discussion', 'ill-fated', 'experience', 'director', 'documentary', 'artist', 'now', 'known', 'Prince', 'fascinating', 'discussion', 'what', 'work', 'man', 'who', 'described', 'one', 'Prince', 'assistants', 'quot', 'Prince', 'World', 'quot', 'Kevin', 'how', 'went', 'giddy', 'fan', 'Prince', 'who', 'was', 'tickled', 'be', 'asked', 'do', 'project', 'non-fan', 'who', 'now', 'could', 'care', 'less', 'Prince.I', 'do', 'have', 'quibbles', 'told', 'story', 'good', 'humor', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'minute', 'details', 'first', 'quot', 'romantic', 'quot', 'experience', 'wife', 'Jen', ""'d"", 'say', '20', 'minutes', 'are', 'dedicated', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'used', 'descibe', 'thoughts', 'one', 'movies', ""'m"", 'not', 'prude', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'enjoyed', 'movies', 'things', 'are', 'better', 'left', 'unsaid', 'least', 'left', 'off', 'DVD', '.Obviously', 'college', 'stints', 'were', 'Q', 'amp', 'A', 'sessions', 'can', 'only', 'answer', 'what', 'was', 'asked', 'crowd', 'However', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'have', 'heard', 'discussion', 'what', 'was', 'work', 'Linda', 'Fiorentino', 'quot', 'Dogma', 'quot', 'who', 'said', 'was', 'so', 'difficult', 'work', 'will', 'never', 'do', 'again', 'could', 'rip', 'Prince', 'Jon', 'Peters', 'entertaining', 'fashion', 'imagine', 'hatchet', 'job', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'her.I', 'also', 'did', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'was', 'decided', 'leave', 'questions', 'asked', 'students', 'who', 'were', 'obviously', 'not', 'coherent', 'just', 'babbled', 'saying', 'anything', 'pertinent', 'Again', 'time', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'spent', 'showing', 'Kevin', 'answer', 'decent', 'questions', 'did', 'get', 'kick', 'Kevin', 'attempt', 'try', 'sweet', 'talk', 'employer', 'student', 'let', 'get', 'job', 'back', 'student', 'was', 'fired', 'going', 'Smith', 'show', 'instead', 'working', '.Overall', 'pretty', 'entertaining', 'good', 'addition', 'Kevin', 'Smith', 'completest']",An Evening with Kevin Smith

That's right, the really quiet guy actually has a lot to say, and it is all entertaining, insightful, interesting, and funny as hell.  Coming from a guy who watches and listens to a lot of stand-up comedy, I was laughing pretty much non-stop.Smith isn't trying to be funny... it just happens to turn out that way.  His subtle and quiet tone makes it all the more entertaining and funny.  Through the humor and sarcastic responses, there's nothing but honesty and sincerity about the filmmaking business that he is in.With two disks, you get over 3 hours of Kevin Smith talking to various universities.  As soon as the disks are over, you want to watch them again.  I love all of Smith's movies, although I have to admit ""Chasing Amy"" is probably my least favorite (but I still think it's good), and watching this was not only funny and entertaining, but it was very informative.  Smith isn't shy about answering the tough questions.  (Some of them, he should be though.  You'll know what I mean when you see it.)He talks about everything.  Some of the stuff he covers are what went on behind the shooting of his movies, his relationships with his actors and friends, critics who have bad-mouthed him, a really messed up director who's obsessed with friggen spiders, how he met his wife, his run in with Tim Burton (or not so much of a ""run-in,"" more like a ""press-in), Scott Mosier Stories, and much, much more.The DVD set is really cool.  To my surprise, the whole thing is WIDESCREEN.  Always a major welcome, no matter what the content is.  Since this is only  Kevin Smith talking to universities, there's no need for special features galore, however there are some bonus trailers.  The DVDs are also digitally mastered in audio and anamorphic video.If you are a fan of Kevin Smith, then this is a must-have.  Go and buy this right now!  Trust me, you will not regret it for a second.  Hey, I even recommend this for all of Smith's negative critics.  Maybe they can take something positive from it all.  I was really impressed.

Smith's stories range from his tales of his first meetings with a teenage Jason Mewes (who, as if most of you don't know, plays Jay in Smith's first five films) to his first meeting with View Askew partner Scott Mosier, and to his painfully funny encounter with a then USA Today interviewer who would eventually become his wife.  Smith also tells some tales about his misadventures inside the insanity of Hollywood; including the story behind his ill-fated screenplay for the canned Superman Reborn film and the money grubbing producers behind it.  Audience participation during the Q&amp;A is almost as equally hilarious; including one fan who lost his job just to be there and Kevin calling the kid's boss on his cell phone to try to smooth it over.  My only gripes about this package are that there are really no extras on the DVD besides some bonus trailers for Columbia films, and some other extras would have been more than welcome.

723908,ARIHVRQ9VH0OQ,B00007149S,Nick Schwartz,"[0, 0]","As soon as I popped An Evening With Kevin Smith into my DVD player, I felt right at home.  Kevin appears on the menu screen immediately and starts acting (silently) about how long you're taking to choose something.  So, before even starting the movie, I saw a character just like Silent Bob on the screen, and felt like this was familiar ground.But then Kevin starts speaking.  And speaking.  And speaking.  The movie, is essentially pieced together footage from a college tour Smith did, where he basically hosts a Q and A session.  And, while it can't truly be considered stand up comedy, it's funnier than most comdeians will ever be.So, the movie is about three hours of Smith answering fans questions, and topics switch from Jason Mewes' (Jay in the five Jersey flicks) sex life, to Kevin's involvement with a new Superman script, to his first sexual encounter with his wife, to Prince, (yes, the musician.)  And I can gurantee that if you are in the least bit interested in Kevin's films, you'll be laughing so hard the three hours will blow by faster than you could possibly imagine.Luckily, there's more to do once you've finished the movie.  While the two-disc set isn't loaded with extra features, it does feature a number of hidden easter eggs, mostly of footage cut from the final film, and they're equally as entertaining as the rest of the movie.So, once you've gotten over the initial shock of hearing ""Silent Bob"" speak at length, you should have a great deal of fun with this movie, and I believe it warrants at the nvery least a rental, if not a purchase.",5,"A Film OF Kevin Smith, not BY him - but just as entertaining",1056585600,"06 26, 2003",2003,1573,"['As', 'soon', 'popped', 'Evening', 'Kevin', 'Smith', 'DVD', 'player', 'felt', 'right', 'home', 'Kevin', 'menu', 'screen', 'immediately', 'acting', 'silently', 'how', 'long', ""'re"", 'taking', 'choose', 'something', 'So', 'even', 'starting', 'movie', 'saw', 'character', 'just', 'Silent', 'Bob', 'screen', 'felt', 'was', 'familiar', 'ground.But', 'then', 'Kevin', 'speaking', 'speaking', 'speaking', 'movie', 'essentially', 'pieced', 'together', 'footage', 'college', 'tour', 'Smith', 'did', 'where', 'basically', 'Q', 'session', 'ca', ""n't"", 'truly', 'be', 'considered', 'stand', 'up', 'comedy', 'funnier', 'most', 'comdeians', 'will', 'ever', 'be.So', 'movie', 'three', 'hours', 'Smith', 'answering', 'fans', 'questions', 'topics', 'switch', 'Jason', 'Mewes', 'Jay', 'five', 'Jersey', 'flicks', 'sex', 'life', 'Kevin', 'involvement', 'new', 'Superman', 'script', 'first', 'sexual', 'encounter', 'wife', 'Prince', 'yes', 'musician', 'can', 'gurantee', 'are', 'least', 'bit', 'interested', 'Kevin', 'films', ""'ll"", 'be', 'laughing', 'so', 'hard', 'three', 'hours', 'will', 'blow', 'faster', 'could', 'possibly', 'imagine.Luckily', 'more', 'do', 'once', ""'ve"", 'finished', 'movie', 'two-disc', 'set', ""n't"", 'loaded', 'extra', 'features', 'feature', 'number', 'hidden', 'easter', 'eggs', 'mostly', 'footage', 'cut', 'final', 'film', ""'re"", 'equally', 'as', 'entertaining', 'rest', 'movie.So', 'once', ""'ve"", 'gotten', 'initial', 'shock', 'hearing', 'Silent', 'Bob', 'speak', 'length', 'should', 'have', 'great', 'deal', 'fun', 'movie', 'believe', 'warrants', 'nvery', 'least', 'rental', 'not', 'purchase']",An Evening with Kevin Smith

Then I sat, and the very first thing you hear the Jersey filmmaker say is, ""Wow!  This makes up for all the times girls told me I had a small d**k.""  Stand-up comedy, though, this is not.  It's a wonderful compilation of Kevin Smith's visit to several colleges, each having its own Q&A; gig.I've always admired Smith's storytelling (references to pop culture and his own movies, and his blunt way of getting his ideas across), but here he's infinitely better without a script.  There are some deep and insightful questions he gives serious responses to (religious influence---sexual experiences), and there are some downright wacky ones (does he want to hang out afterwards---can somebody suck his d**k).The real strength of this program are the pop culture questions.  Smith talks about his hellacious experience (for 30 minutes!) filming a documentary for Prince.  He also goes into detail about his attempts to writing a ""Superman"" script, plus some tension with Tim Burton.The only drawback to ""An Evening With Kevin SMith"" is not the nearly 4-hour length (I'd actually like more...but I'm forgiving).  No, it's actually the biographical questions.  When he details details like how he met producer Scott Mosier, or his friendship with Jason Mewes, he always throws in some funny one-liners and tidbits of funny info.  But the overall answers don't work for me.  I understand that 4 hours leaves a lot of room for a little error, so those few sore questions aren't enough to write this one off.The DVD features are scarce, but this DVD is for Kevin Smith fans anyway.  I'd even recommend a borrow or rental of this DVD for people interested in one of the current generation's filmmakers ideas.

In addition to a surprise appearance by his on-screen ""hetero life-mate"" Jason Mewes, Smith takes questions from the audience consisting of not only university students, but also fans of his movies. The huge size of the audience (some are in the thousands) is a testament to how large the cult following of Kevin Smith actually is.Throughout ""Evening"" Smith gives the audience a laugh a minute, displaying his natural sense of humor that can be seen in all of his movies. Among the subjects covered are: how he chose Mewes for the part of Jay, and why  Smith's character ""Silent Bob"" is  silent? He also discusses how ""hurtful"" it was when he met his wife, and his appearance on the cover of the pot-legalization magazine ""High Times.""On a more serious note, Smith talks about his controversial religious film ""Dogma"", and reveals, among other things, how many death threats he received because of it.Probably the most fascinating parts of ""Evening"" are when Smith talks about some of the unusual movie projects he has been asked to contribute to. He reveals at great lengths the inside stories on: writing the script for a new ""Superman"" movie; and the documentary he filmed on pop star Prince that will probably never be seen. He says he did them because he is, in his own words, a ""press whore.""Finally, he answers the question he gets from his fans probably more than any other: will there be another ""Jay and Silent Bob"" movie?In conclusion, if you're like me and you are a fan of Kevin Smith's five films, this video is well worth the price.

Here is a guy after all who has directed a number of feature movies, is friends with Ben Affleck and has created one of the screen's most recognizable character's in Silent Bob, however, his laid back self awareness, whether it be about his weight or his penis size, allows Smith to tear down any pretense of stardom and create a dialogue with his audiences that says ""hey they let a normal person become a celebrity!""The comfort level Smith creates allows an intimate connection with personality and audience that sucks you in as a viewer, as students feel close enough to Smith to ask questions which prompts answers such as ""you know Woody Allen doesn't go through this.""
