He causes accidents so his victims end up out cold and wounded.  When they awake they're in the funeral home, and drugged. He tells them that they died in an accident, and that he has a gift - that he can speak to the dead.  All the while letting the world believe they're already dead.  His latest victim is Christina Ricci.The drugs keep her from feeling her body, she look like corpse when he's done.  In the beginning she fights.  Not to live but to escape.

However, I felt compelled to go to the ""Extra Features"" after the movie was over. I normally do not do this. After having done so I saw a quick interview with the director. She described some information about the movie which makes a LOT more sense. I was rather ""riveted"" by what the director was saying while there were flashbacks from the movie to show what she was talking about and to fill in the blanks.I would love to go into detail about all of it here but I think it would give too much away. I would recommend watching the movie and then watch the extra feature ""Delving Into the Afterlife."" I found the director to be rather clever in executing the entire storyline. But I will admit that it was a long movie and I was a tad confused. But after having heard the director comment I am now recollecting the entire movie in my mind and am able to put the pieces together. I am so tempted to go into detail and I just realized that some reviewers gave too much away already. ROTTEN SPOILERS YOU! I am glad I saw the movie first along with the director's comments before having seen the reviews here.I did not know what to expect since I rented this movie from a machine (outside a grocery store) without knowing what to expect. I thought it was going to be a supernatural thriller. It was, indeed, thought provoking regarding the fact that we will all eventually die. If a few details could have been more polished I would give this movie five stars but I am giving it four. It is definitely an above average film.

1346973,AH1SYAYDV2VLG,B003IY498Y,"A. Kingsriter ""IntlAngel""","[1, 1]","Having never heard of this movie, I rented it based on the acting talent. I didn't know what it was about or heard any reviews so didn't expect anything, really. Liam Neeson plays a funeral director who has a ""gift"" of being able to speak to the newly dead. Christina Ricci is his latest ""body"", Justin Long her boyfriend with whom she's having trouble. After a fight, Ricci is involved in a car accident and finds her on the slab at Neesons funeral home.The twist is that you really don't know if Ricci is alive or dead. Neeson plays a lovely balance of creepy and endearing making you second guess what is going on right to the end of the movie. It's nice to see Long as a character totally different than what he usually plays, and he plays it very convincingly. Ricci plays pretty much the same character she always does, her acting range isn't very wide in my personal opinion, but I enjoyed her performance all the same. Her look and style are perfect for this genre.There is quite a lot of nudity in it, but honestly, I was surpirsed there wasn't more seeing as she is supposedly a dead body getting ready for burial.Is it the best thriller out there, no.

1346974,AC3064RV9PV62,B003IY498Y,"A. Masion ""history lover and realist""","[6, 10]","Warning:  this review contains ""spoiler"" information.I decided this film deserved 2 stars instead of 3 stars because the good points -- top-notch acting, good score, nice scenes/setting, and beautiful cinematography -- could not outweigh the huge disadvantage of fragmented, imperfect storytelling littered with too many plotholes, red herrings, and loose ends as a substitute for ambiguity.I ordered this film because of the cast and the impressive trailer. The trailer left me with the incorrect impression the film was a supernatural thriller.In an effort to legimitimize itself as an ""artistic"" work, the film includes much skin-baring of Christina Ricci.  She spends most of the film in a clingy red slip.  A few gratuitous nude scenes are included, but they aren't sexy or titillating, some are quite gory.The film is rife with cliche -- the child sociopath eager to graduate from torturing/killing animals to torturing/killing people.  The ingenue lost in a maelstrom of confusion and lacking the courage to save her own life.  The hateful, selfish, abusive mother.  The love interest, an attorney best friends with a cop, is convinced his girlfriend is still alive and promptly drinks himself under the table instead of doing something about it.The biggest letdown is Deacon (Liam Neeson's character) and his motives.  I mean, come on! This guy justifies his compulsion as purging the world/society of ""lifeless"" people.  I saw nothing in the film depicting Deacon as somehow more interesting, productive, or worthy of life/living than his victims.There's plot twisting and then there's self-indulgent, unreliable storytelling.  ""After.Life"" represents the second example.  If you enjoy stories of bland, generally unlikeable morticians who kidnap accident victims, employ psychological manipulation and ply the victim with drugs to convince them they're deceased, administer paralytic drugs to give them the appearance of death, and chat nonsensically with souvenir photographs of the victims after funerals and premature burials, this movie might work for you.",2,Select With Caution  (Spoiler Review),1281398400,"08 10, 2010",2010,2070,"['Warning', 'review', 'spoiler', 'information.I', 'decided', 'film', 'deserved', '2', 'stars', 'instead', '3', 'stars', 'good', 'points', 'top-notch', 'acting', 'good', 'score', 'nice', 'scenes/setting', 'beautiful', 'cinematography', 'could', 'not', 'outweigh', 'huge', 'disadvantage', 'fragmented', 'imperfect', 'storytelling', 'littered', 'too', 'many', 'plotholes', 'red', 'herrings', 'loose', 'ends', 'substitute', 'ambiguity.I', 'ordered', 'film', 'cast', 'impressive', 'trailer', 'trailer', 'left', 'incorrect', 'impression', 'film', 'was', 'supernatural', 'thriller.In', 'effort', 'legimitimize', 'artistic', 'work', 'film', 'much', 'skin-baring', 'Christina', 'Ricci', 'most', 'film', 'clingy', 'red', 'slip', 'few', 'gratuitous', 'nude', 'scenes', 'are', 'included', 'are', ""n't"", 'sexy', 'titillating', 'are', 'quite', 'gory.The', 'film', 'rife', 'cliche', 'child', 'sociopath', 'eager', 'graduate', 'torturing/killing', 'animals', 'torturing/killing', 'people', 'ingenue', 'lost', 'maelstrom', 'confusion', 'lacking', 'courage', 'save', 'own', 'life', 'hateful', 'selfish', 'abusive', 'mother', 'love', 'interest', 'attorney', 'best', 'friends', 'cop', 'convinced', 'girlfriend', 'still', 'alive', 'promptly', 'table', 'instead', 'doing', 'something', 'it.The', 'biggest', 'letdown', 'Deacon', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'character', 'motives', 'mean', 'come', 'guy', 'compulsion', 'purging', 'world/society', 'lifeless', 'people', 'saw', 'nothing', 'film', 'depicting', 'Deacon', 'somehow', 'more', 'interesting', 'productive', 'worthy', 'life/living', 'victims.There', 'plot', 'twisting', 'then', 'self-indulgent', 'unreliable', 'storytelling', 'After.Life', 'second', 'example', 'enjoy', 'stories', 'bland', 'generally', 'unlikeable', 'morticians', 'who', 'kidnap', 'accident', 'victims', 'employ', 'psychological', 'manipulation', 'ply', 'victim', 'drugs', 'convince', ""'re"", 'deceased', 'administer', 'paralytic', 'drugs', 'give', 'appearance', 'death', 'nonsensically', 'souvenir', 'photographs', 'victims', 'funerals', 'premature', 'burials', 'movie', 'might', 'work']",After.Life

1346978,A3EUSH8DPW75LR,B003IY498Y,barry,"[3, 8]","I wasn't sure what to expect with this film.  I like all the actors and thought the story sounded very intruiging but today so many films released in no way match their potential.  The film stars Christina Ricci as Anna, a school teacher who is involved with lawyer Paul Coleman who is played by Justin Long.  The movie is filmed with a mysteriousness to it from the very beginning.  These two are a couple yet they are fighting from the very beginning.  It is hard to get a grasp at first on how we are to connect to them.  But if you have read anything about this film you know that Anna gets in an accident and dies.  Yet the question becomes is she really dead or not?  Saying this much is giving away none of the plot.  Most of the movie takes place with Anna's body in the funeral home where she is being prepared for her funeral and burial by the funeral director Deacon played by Liam Neeson.  But Christina Ricci is not lying still as the dead do.  She is awake, alert and very confused by her surroundings and predicament.  Liam Neeson supposedly has a special sense where he can communicate with the dead and he explains all to her as he tries to get her prepared for her next step in death.  Many people view Anna's body and all they see is a dead corpse.  It is only Deacon who can interact with the woman.But the movie is in no way this simple.  We have a young boy, one of Anna's students, who can also see her and Paul never believes that she is indeed dead.  I was caught up in the film from the beginning but was delighted when the script introduced many twists and turns that answered all and any questions and also brought up many issues all people have about living life, experiencing love and accepting fate.  Christina Ricci is superb as Anna.  Yes, she is naked throughout a great deal of the film but her skills are so extreme that it is in no way gratuitous.  It is necessary for the plot and though she is a very beautiful woman you will find yourself following her superb acting more than dwelling on the lack of clothing.  Liam Neeson is also excellent and Justin Long was an excellent choice as the solid everyman type boyfriend.  He is a good person with no motives.  He merely loves Anna deeply.The twists and turns make sense here and the director weaves it all together with skill and great intelligence.  This film is a psychological drama but also a very high suspense film.  It pulls you in, gets you to care for these characters be they good or bad and then the twists get tossed in.  Like I said, they all work and they will send you on a headspin which is what a good suspense film does.  I was so enthralled in the last half I did not want it to end.  Is Anna dead or alive?  This question is the basis for what is an excellent strong drama with heaps of believable suspense.  And the film also stayed with me long after with many thoughts runing through my head.  Another sign of a great film.  I highly recommend this film but just remember it is not your regular nonsensical thriller.  You must pay attention with this one and never let your guard down.  And then it will be a great experience.",5,Intelligent thriller,1281225600,"08 8, 2010",2010,3138,"['was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'what', 'expect', 'film', 'actors', 'thought', 'story', 'sounded', 'very', 'intruiging', 'today', 'so', 'many', 'films', 'released', 'way', 'match', 'potential', 'film', 'stars', 'Christina', 'Ricci', 'Anna', 'school', 'teacher', 'who', 'involved', 'lawyer', 'Paul', 'Coleman', 'who', 'played', 'Justin', 'Long', 'movie', 'filmed', 'mysteriousness', 'very', 'beginning', 'two', 'are', 'couple', 'yet', 'are', 'fighting', 'very', 'beginning', 'hard', 'get', 'grasp', 'first', 'how', 'are', 'connect', 'have', 'read', 'anything', 'film', 'know', 'Anna', 'accident', 'dies', 'question', 'really', 'dead', 'not', 'Saying', 'much', 'giving', 'away', 'none', 'plot', 'Most', 'movie', 'place', 'Anna', 'body', 'funeral', 'home', 'where', 'being', 'prepared', 'funeral', 'burial', 'funeral', 'director', 'Deacon', 'played', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'Christina', 'Ricci', 'not', 'lying', 'still', 'dead', 'do', 'awake', 'alert', 'very', 'confused', 'surroundings', 'predicament', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'supposedly', 'special', 'sense', 'where', 'can', 'communicate', 'dead', 'get', 'prepared', 'next', 'step', 'death', 'Many', 'people', 'view', 'Anna', 'body', 'see', 'dead', 'corpse', 'only', 'Deacon', 'who', 'can', 'interact', 'woman.But', 'movie', 'way', 'simple', 'have', 'young', 'boy', 'one', 'Anna', 'students', 'who', 'can', 'also', 'see', 'Paul', 'never', 'indeed', 'dead', 'was', 'caught', 'up', 'film', 'beginning', 'was', 'delighted', 'when', 'script', 'introduced', 'many', 'twists', 'answered', 'questions', 'also', 'brought', 'up', 'many', 'issues', 'people', 'have', 'living', 'life', 'experiencing', 'love', 'accepting', 'fate', 'Christina', 'Ricci', 'superb', 'Anna', 'Yes', 'naked', 'great', 'deal', 'film', 'skills', 'are', 'so', 'extreme', 'way', 'gratuitous', 'necessary', 'plot', 'very', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'will', 'find', 'following', 'superb', 'acting', 'more', 'dwelling', 'lack', 'clothing', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'also', 'excellent', 'Justin', 'Long', 'was', 'excellent', 'choice', 'solid', 'everyman', 'type', 'boyfriend', 'good', 'person', 'motives', 'merely', 'Anna', 'deeply.The', 'twists', 'turns', 'make', 'sense', 'here', 'director', 'together', 'skill', 'great', 'intelligence', 'film', 'psychological', 'drama', 'also', 'very', 'high', 'suspense', 'film', 'care', 'characters', 'be', 'good', 'bad', 'then', 'twists', 'get', 'tossed', 'said', 'work', 'will', 'send', 'headspin', 'what', 'good', 'suspense', 'film', 'was', 'so', 'enthralled', 'last', 'half', 'did', 'not', 'want', 'end', 'Anna', 'dead', 'alive', 'question', 'basis', 'what', 'excellent', 'strong', 'drama', 'heaps', 'believable', 'suspense', 'film', 'also', 'stayed', 'long', 'many', 'thoughts', 'runing', 'head', 'sign', 'great', 'film', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'just', 'remember', 'not', 'regular', 'nonsensical', 'thriller', 'must', 'pay', 'attention', 'one', 'never', 'let', 'guard', 'down', 'then', 'will', 'be', 'great', 'experience']",After.Life

E Jackson,"[1, 2]","It seems a theme is developing- every single movie I see Christina Ricci star in happens to follow a similar type of flow as far as storyline development is concerned.  That being, the storyline is normally quite easy to understand requiring very little effort on the part of the viewers to actually think or grasp the events taking place on screen, but they are always entertaining and keep me watching nonetheless.  Plus Christina Ricci *is* quite the beautiful woman, and it's strange how her face (and her body, hehe) never seems to grow older.Now what's especially worth noting about After.Life is that I was almost 100% totally convinced about 30 minutes before the conclusion that I knew exactly where the storyline was going.  It seemed like all the clues were headed in one particular direction.  To put it lightly, there is definitely a HUGE surprising twist at the very end that totally left me floored.  I did not see... *that* coming, hehe.  I won't dare spoil it though, and hopefully nobody else writing this review spoiled it either.Anyway yeah, the storyline.  It's amazingly creepy because I believe for most people death is quite the difficult subject.  Difficult to grasp or understand, and just plain difficult to deal with.  It's about a girl who either believes she's dead or really is dead (I won't dare tell which one!) thanks to the old man playing the part of a funeral home worker (Liam Neeson, the second most popular character in the film next to Ricci's character) who's pretty warped and likes to fill Ricci's head with really bizarre things that nearly make the poor girl crazy.  Let's just leave it at that so as not to accidentally spoil anything storyline-related, hehe.Overall, solid acting, a performance by Justin Long that finally DOES feel believable and pretty good, and just a really twisted take on the ever fascinating subject of death.

1346987,A14XW8BJGEBM91,B003IY498Y,Carlos E. Velasquez,"[15, 22]","It took me quite some time to get started in writing this review. You see, ""After.Life"" is a film unlike anything I have seen in a while. This doesn't mean, in any way, that the movie in bad - on the contrary, this is an unconventional picture that defies categorization: it can be a drama or it can be a mild horror film. At any rate, ""After.Life"" is smart and engaging, an unforgettable experience.Christina Ricci stars as Anna Taylor, a young school teacher who is apparently engaged to Paul Coleman (Justin Long), a successful lawyer. Early in the movie, we watch her attending the funeral of a former piano teacher. It is there that we meet Eliot Deacon (Liam Neeson), funeral director of the cemetery in which the burial was taking place. She later joins Paul for dinner, and he informs her about some news that made her angry. After some loud arguing, she leaves the restaurant in a rush, and takes off by herself. Predictably, she had an accident and, as a result, she dies. Next thing, she wakes up at the funeral home in which Eliot is about to prepare her body for viewing. She has scars as a result from the accident that killed her. She argues with Eliot that she is still alive, and he informs her that she suffered massive internal trauma due to the car accident, which caused her death.  He also tells her that he has the capacity to hear and talk to the dead - he ""helps the dead to make the transition."" He claims that he hears their complaints all the time, and that hers is not new. She insists that she is still alive, and Eliot tries to convince her otherwise. The story slowly develops under this premise, and the director (Agnieszka Wojtowicz-Vosloo) provides clues throughout the movie about whether or not Anna is indeed alive.""After.Life"" is dark, as expected, yet it has a beautiful, colorful production design and photography. Christina Ricci has to be commended for the choices she makes in films - she spends half the film with no clothes on and stills delivers like the best under those presumably uncomfortable conditions.  Neeson, on the other hand, also portrays his character with restraint, given the fact that his wife in real life recently died, and he has to make a film about death.

1346988,AZVEPWRYOFBX5,B003IY498Y,Charity Bishop,"[1, 2]","Some movies you know nothing about going into them and that's how best to view them. This is one of those movies.Anna (Christina Ricci) has a mundane life. Her relationship with Paul (Justin Long) makes him happy but no longer seems to resonate with her at all. She is most at ease teaching at grade school, where her favorite student is the unusual and compassionate Jack (Chandler Canterbury). That particular day she must leave early for a funeral and on the way there, makes a spontaneous choice to have her hair dyed red. Afterward, she meets up with Paul at a restaurant, where he intends to propose but his bungled conversation beforehand convinces her that he intends to break up with her and she storms out of the restaurant in a rage. Refusing to listen to his side of the story, she cranks up the audio in her car and drives off into a storm.The next thing she knows, Anna is waking up in the morgue where the gentle, mild-mannered but slightly sinister mortician, Eliot (Liam Neeson), informs her that she is dead. Everyone dies, and most of them don't believe it at first. They continue to fight to survive but their time grows short. He would like Anna to come to terms with her death, release her hold over the living, and enter the afterlife. He is the only one who can hear and see her, communicate with her. Anna is reluctant to believe him but cannot explain her situation otherwise. In the meantime, Paul attempts to come to terms with her death but cannot shake the feeling that she may still be alive. So which is it? Is she dead... or is she alive and in the hands of a twisted psychopath? Believe it or not, this film keeps you guessing right until the end -- and it concludes on a slightly ambiguous note. If you like straight out answers this will frustrate you, even though in my opinion the conclusion is made fairly obvious through the concluding evidence of the final scenes.I love movies that really mess with your mind and this one does. It would have me convinced one moment that she was dead, the next it would raise some serious questions that made me doubt my earlier conclusion. In purely mind-bender terms, this one of the best scripts I have seen and if it has one flaw, it is that some of its illogical loop-holes aren't explained (at least, on screen... we are free to draw our own conclusions). It kept me riveted from beginning to end and after reaching the conclusion, I kind of wanted to watch it all over again. Therefore it pains me to say that there is no way I can recommend this film, because it is very casual about its nudity -- and there is a lot of it. The opening credits is the camera following the naked curves of a beautiful woman; the opening scene shows Paul and Anna having sex (she is bored by it); we see her breasts. She takes a shower; we see her shapely outline through the shower door. Later on, clothes are cut off her, clothes are put on her (always with breast nudity), she spends a portion of the film nude in the morgue (often interacting with Eliot, which is just creepy) and the camera framing shows us a lot more of her than I ever wanted to see. There's no full frontal nudity but some backside. Paul has a nightmare about her in which he discovers that while in the shower, she has ripped out her own heart -- she stands holding it in one hand, while blood flows down from the incision in her bare chest. While covered by a sheet, and unconscious, she is peeked at by a male visitor to the morgue. She spends much of the movie in only a short red silk slip.There are about a dozen f-words, four uses of GD, two of Jesus' name, and a handful of references to s***. One thing that may offend Christian viewers is that when explaining his gift to someone, Eliot says that he's like Jesus -- who could also communicate with and raise the dead. Violence is limited to some eerie sequences in the morgue that never amount to anything; Anna threatens Eliot with a knife and scissors. A man hits a child (earning him the horror of passerby), a man assaults another man and shoves him into a wall, there are implications of car accidents, and on occasion gaping wounds that are sewn up (graphically). A man is stabbed with an embalming implement in order to drain him of blood. There are some especially creepy, symbolic, and frightening nightmare scenes in which Anna imagines being buried alive (maggots crawl out of her mouth), being surrounded by creepy-looking mourners, and accosted by other dead people. Either decision you make toward the end, the outcome is morbid.Acting-wise, this film is stellar. Liam Neeson is brilliant as a man who you are unsure of, who scares you and at the same time makes you feel almost ""safe"" in his presence. I know that does not make any sense, but it's true. You like him. You feel for him. But there is something about him that you cannot entirely trust. The kid is fantastic and Christina has never impressed me more. I really, really wish this film had been more about building the continuing suspense rather than lingering on her naked body. There is a difference between atmosphere and intentional provocative material and from the shots they chose to incorporate, it's clear they went for the latter. It's unfortunate because otherwise it was an intense experience.",2,Parental Review,1363824000,"03 21, 2013",2013,5280,"['movies', 'know', 'nothing', 'going', 'how', 'best', 'view', 'one', 'movies.Anna', 'Christina', 'Ricci', 'mundane', 'life', 'relationship', 'Paul', 'Justin', 'Long', 'happy', 'longer', 'resonate', 'most', 'ease', 'teaching', 'grade', 'school', 'where', 'favorite', 'student', 'unusual', 'compassionate', 'Jack', 'Chandler', 'Canterbury', 'particular', 'day', 'must', 'leave', 'early', 'funeral', 'way', 'there', 'spontaneous', 'choice', 'have', 'hair', 'dyed', 'red', 'Afterward', 'up', 'Paul', 'restaurant', 'where', 'propose', 'bungled', 'conversation', 'beforehand', 'break', 'up', 'restaurant', 'rage', 'Refusing', 'listen', 'side', 'story', 'up', 'audio', 'car', 'off', 'storm.The', 'next', 'thing', 'Anna', 'waking', 'up', 'morgue', 'where', 'gentle', 'mild-mannered', 'slightly', 'sinister', 'mortician', 'Eliot', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'dead', 'Everyone', 'most', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'first', 'continue', 'fight', 'survive', 'time', 'short', 'would', 'like', 'Anna', 'come', 'terms', 'death', 'release', 'hold', 'living', 'enter', 'afterlife', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'can', 'hear', 'see', 'communicate', 'Anna', 'reluctant', 'believe', 'can', 'not', 'explain', 'situation', 'otherwise', 'meantime', 'Paul', 'come', 'terms', 'death', 'can', 'not', 'shake', 'feeling', 'may', 'still', 'be', 'alive', 'So', 'dead', 'alive', 'hands', 'twisted', 'psychopath', 'Believe', 'not', 'film', 'guessing', 'right', 'end', 'slightly', 'ambiguous', 'note', 'like', 'straight', 'out', 'answers', 'will', 'frustrate', 'even', 'opinion', 'conclusion', 'made', 'fairly', 'obvious', 'concluding', 'evidence', 'final', 'scenes.I', 'love', 'movies', 'really', 'mind', 'one', 'would', 'have', 'convinced', 'one', 'moment', 'was', 'dead', 'next', 'would', 'raise', 'serious', 'questions', 'made', 'doubt', 'earlier', 'conclusion', 'purely', 'mind-bender', 'terms', 'one', 'best', 'scripts', 'have', 'seen', 'one', 'flaw', 'illogical', 'loop-holes', 'are', ""n't"", 'explained', 'least', 'screen', 'are', 'free', 'draw', 'own', 'conclusions', 'kept', 'riveted', 'beginning', 'end', 'reaching', 'conclusion', 'kind', 'wanted', 'watch', 'over', 'again', 'Therefore', 'say', 'way', 'can', 'recommend', 'film', 'very', 'casual', 'nudity', 'lot', 'opening', 'credits', 'camera', 'following', 'naked', 'curves', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'opening', 'scene', 'Paul', 'Anna', 'having', 'sex', 'bored', 'see', 'breasts', 'shower', 'see', 'shapely', 'outline', 'shower', 'door', 'Later', 'clothes', 'are', 'cut', 'off', 'clothes', 'are', 'put', 'always', 'breast', 'nudity', 'portion', 'film', 'nude', 'morgue', 'often', 'interacting', 'Eliot', 'just', 'creepy', 'camera', 'framing', 'lot', 'more', 'ever', 'wanted', 'see', 'full', 'frontal', 'nudity', 'backside', 'Paul', 'nightmare', 'shower', 'ripped', 'out', 'own', 'heart', 'holding', 'one', 'hand', 'blood', 'flows', 'down', 'incision', 'bare', 'chest', 'covered', 'sheet', 'unconscious', 'peeked', 'male', 'visitor', 'morgue', 'much', 'movie', 'only', 'short', 'red', 'silk', 'are', 'dozen', 'f-words', 'four', 'uses', 'GD', 'two', 'Jesus', 'name', 'handful', 'references', 's***', 'One', 'thing', 'may', 'offend', 'Christian', 'viewers', 'when', 'explaining', 'gift', 'someone', 'Eliot', 'Jesus', 'who', 'could', 'also', 'communicate', 'raise', 'dead', 'Violence', 'limited', 'eerie', 'sequences', 'morgue', 'never', 'amount', 'anything', 'Anna', 'Eliot', 'knife', 'scissors', 'man', 'child', 'earning', 'horror', 'passerby', 'man', 'man', 'wall', 'are', 'implications', 'car', 'accidents', 'occasion', 'gaping', 'wounds', 'are', 'sewn', 'up', 'graphically', 'man', 'stabbed', 'embalming', 'implement', 'order', 'drain', 'blood', 'are', 'especially', 'creepy', 'symbolic', 'frightening', 'nightmare', 'scenes', 'Anna', 'imagines', 'being', 'buried', 'alive', 'maggots', 'crawl', 'mouth', 'being', 'surrounded', 'creepy-looking', 'mourners', 'accosted', 'other', 'dead', 'people', 'decision', 'make', 'end', 'outcome', 'morbid.Acting-wise', 'film', 'stellar', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'brilliant', 'man', 'who', 'are', 'unsure', 'who', 'same', 'time', 'feel', 'almost', 'safe', 'presence', 'know', 'not', 'make', 'sense', 'true', 'feel', 'something', 'can', 'not', 'entirely', 'trust', 'kid', 'fantastic', 'Christina', 'never', 'impressed', 'more', 'really', 'really', 'wish', 'film', 'had', 'been', 'more', 'building', 'continuing', 'suspense', 'rather', 'lingering', 'naked', 'body', 'difference', 'atmosphere', 'intentional', 'provocative', 'material', 'shots', 'chose', 'incorporate', 'clear', 'went', 'latter', 'unfortunate', 'was', 'intense', 'experience']",After.Life

1346990,A6J7UPYUI96XO,B003IY498Y,"Cory T. Shaeffer ""HockeyFanatic""","[3, 5]","Given the talent of the cast assembled for this film (Christina Ricci, Liam Neeson, Justin Long), not to mention the huge level of success each of these actors has reached in previous films of this nature, one can't help but have elevated expectations for ""After.Life.""But the film does not work in terms of creating a tense, suspensful atmosphere - and that is not due to the lack of creepy effects, nor is it due to lack of trying. It fails because it assumes that a dark, dismal setting combined with repetitive spoken dialogue is tantamount to a tightly constructed story; one which maximizes the talents of the cast by developing the characters. Early in the film, the directors and writers waste that opportunity to a large degree. Basically the story develops around two struggling young lovers who have their own demons (which are never fully explained). After a fight, Ricci appears to die in a car accident. When in the morgue, her corpse awakens and begins to have dialogue with the mortician (Neeson) who we are told has some special power of external perception. In other words, he can talk to dead people.Ricci tries to contact Long, and enters many emotional pleas to Neeson that she is not dead but in fact trapped between the dead and the living. Neeson has his own demons, too (which are never fully explained), and although he gives a stoic, creepy performance, he is bogged down by a bad script, banal dialogue, and trite one-liners. Long struggles to emote throughout the film, as this is one of his weaker performances. Of course, there is the obligatory ""big twist"" at the film's end, and as there is in every other film like this, there is a mysterious young boy who can talk to the dead.If you have low expectations, or are a fan of the ""Twilight Zone"" (minus the intelligent dialogue), you might find this rewarding.

Still, it should more or less appeal to fans of horror and/or Christina Ricci. It's suspenseful but often draggy, with a few fairly decent surprises. As you've probably guessed, this film is really grim and humorless with a number of vagaries. AFTER LIFE begins to touch on several concepts which are never completely fleshed-out (no pun intended) and don't always fit in with the rest of its plot, which is dissatisfying. There are also some interesting spiritual nuances and overtones--references to Jesus's ability to raise the dead, etc--which, again, could have really enhanced this with more development. Though it's basically interesting, AFTER LIFE is one of those films where the makers were obviously unsure of how to build the story and where to take it.

Or does he?Like so many child actresses before her (Anne Hathaway, Alyssa Milano, to name a few), this is a ""coming of age"" movie where Christina Ricci sheds her innocent adolescent guise.

Of course, this is not something I'm going to complain about ~ she has an exquisite body.

But, this movie kept me awake for the next 103 minutes - and had me very confused until the very end.  With the movie still fresh on my mind, I came to Amazon to see what my fellow reviewers had to say about the film (read the ""spoilers"" too)!  I really didn't put it together until the very last scene, when Justin's character gets his on the mortician's table.  In my opinion, both were very much alive when they arrived there.  One scene I found strange (until now), was the fact that when Ricci's character called Long's character, her speech was so garbled to as appear unintelligible.  At first, I thought to myself, ""a voice of the dead?""  But, then, it hit me.  The relaxing/paralyzing drugs that he administered to her - and WHERE he administered them - right in the throat!  In her mind, she'd make perfect sense in her speech, but in reality, all Long's character would hear is an unintelligent, garbled hub-bub of a one way conversation.  But, again, that didn't hit me until 12 hours after watching the movie.  As I had said earlier with Long's character - Neeson's character wasted NO TIME with him and took him straight away!Conclusion:  The mortician was a ""freakin'"" psycopathic nut-job!!  But, he did have people there that were ""really"" dead, for they said not a word.  Credit Ricci's character for having the will to struggle, to reach for life, but in the end, it was all in what was left inside their minds!This movie has affected me enough that most likely, I will NOT buy it, but I commend the director, cast and crew for making the most of what they had to work with.

Not having noticed whether this played in theaters or is one of the direct to DVD films, that question is tough to answer.  The director and writer Agnieszka Wojtowicz-Vosloo (writing in tandem with Paul Vosloo and Jakub Korolczuk) asks us to suspend belief and muse about the idea that there is  a time between 'death' and the actual burial (or other means of final interment/disposal)  when the spirit may struggle with the idea of life ending.  It is an interesting hiatus to study and fortunately a cast was selected to portray the characters involved in this internet-like game that makes it watchable.Schoolteacher Anna Taylor (Christina Ricci) and Paul Coleman (Justin Long) are in a rocky relationship: they could be headed toward marriage but Anna has trust issues that prevent her from committing to same.  In a rage she leaves the frustrated Coleman, subsequently is killed in a car accident, and is taken to a mortuary where mortician Elliot Deacon (Liam Neeson) begins preparing her body for the funeral.  Anna is unable to move anything but her mouth and denies that she is dead, a situation Deacon encounters with most every dead body he prepares for burial. And this is where the conundrum begins: is Anna dead or is she alive, kept prisoner by Deacon?  Anna's hateful mother (Celia Watson) visits her daughter's corpse and has few kind words to say.  Paul is devastated, comforted by his colleague Tom (Josh Charles),  that Anna is dead and visits the mortuary to see the body but is refused admittance by Deacon.  One of Anna's young students Jack (Chandler Canterbury) seems to have a special affinity for the dead and spies on the mortuary where he sees Anna standing in a window. Anna and Deacon have long talks about the after.life - that time when the soul is preparing to leave the corporal body - and Deacon continues to prepare Anna for her funeral.  As she is buried the facts of the story straighten out a bit, but to reveal those facts would ruin what little suspense there is in this film.Though the moody atmosphere is well captured by both the director of photography Anastas N. Michos and the musical score by Paul Haslinger, and the presence of Liam Neeson who plays his role very straight  and Christina Ricci who plays her role almost entirely in the nude, give the story the requisite creepy effect.  Yes, it is corny in many ways, but at least it is a bit different from the formula movies that keep churning out of Hollywood.

This was a good movie, however this storyline is completely implausible. A mortician acquiring bodies that apparently never go any further than the scene of an accident to directly to his funeral home.  And apparently somehow acquiring a death certificate from a Doctor in the mean-time. This is the most confusing part of the movie which had me saying Anna has to be truly dead. But in the extra's the director makes it clear she's alive with most of the funeral directors previous unfortunate clients.  He apparently causes their deaths on the highway, running them off the road with his white van, never getting caught, no one ever seeing him involved in these accidents, and no damage to his van or himself. No police reports? All these bodies are just taken from the scene of an accident to a funeral home. No ambulances? Is it saying the mortician is there placing his death like inducing drug into all his new clients right before the ambulance arrives, with this the ambulance crew can now tell the Doctor at a hospital this persons dead. In America, you need an official death certificate; you only get this from a Doctor.  Would not the ambulances, the doctors, the police begin to suspect something after 5-6 people are involved in an accident and the mortician from down the road is always there on the scene first? Also, I was convinced she was dead because when Anna fist saw herself in a full length mirror, she was as she said ""a corpse"".  They never explained this, her grey skin, sullen eyes. Too many oddities-like was the little boy dead? His picture certainly seemed to be on the morticians wall-shown at least twice. Was he the one true ghost the mortician could speak with? I say he might have been dead by the way his mother never responded to him, appeared to never hear him or know he was around, in addition to just looking completely sad in her two appearances. There are about twenty odd little things that didn't  add up in the movie-I won't go into them all, but just to say one glaring oddity, one mortician runs this big funeral house by himself? No staff, no help. I've never been to a funeral home where only one person can run the funeral from beginning to end by themselves, but this one had several going at the same time.

1347013,A2HW33PQSRHLNO,B003IY498Y,J from NY,"[2, 4]","Agnieszka Wojtowicz-Vosloo's ""Afterlife"" is a rare film that, while certainly not being the feel good movie of the week, is a serious meditation on life and death. Actor Liam Neeson has taken a decidedly different turn in his career (""Taken"", ""The A-Team"") and his change of cinematic scenery consummates itself in his role as Eliot Deacon, a funeral home director (the character's last name is most certainly no accident.)The movie is not at all frolicsome: most of the crucial events happen predictably in Deacon's very own ""after.life"", the funeral home in which he imagines himself and unfortunately for all practical purposes is a God.  Christini Ricci (one of my favorite actresses who I was somehow not surprised to see here) is Anna Taylor, a young woman who crashes her car into a truck on a stormy night after an argument with her boyfriend Paul Coleman (Justin Long, an actor with the emotional reaction time of a brain damaged Keanu Reeves).  It is here that she departs from her death-in-life to a life-in-death, awakening in the somehow  hands of Deacon and being told that she is indeed dead, though she moves and breathes.Deacon creates a sort of netherworld, an unholy monastery of the living but dead with his chosen ""profession"".  He administers all the drugs that would normally be reserved for a corpse to Anna, because in his personal opinion she is indeed dead as Jimmy Hoffa.  Protesting that she is alive, he exclaims: ""You people always say the samethings!""  Lording over her compromised psyche, one can tell if one watches closely that he is actually insane enough to let her try and escape. He considers himself a sort of father to these wounded people, and treats them like they are ""his children"".  He wants to see if these people who with unlived lives are finally ready to make some plunges once they face what they've always been avoiding: death.  And there is indeed a part in which Anna concedes to her fate: he opens the door and tells her to go, go see her boyfriend (who understands the reality of the situation intermittently but never gets the punch line till it's much too late) and Ricci's character states bluntly: ""I'm glad it's over.  I'm glad I'm dead.""Embalming fluid drenches every frame of this movie like a waterfall and you can smell it.  It is not for everyone.  The bleak outlook on human nature even extends to the higher-ups: it's pretty obvious that somebody in the police department is working for Deacon, because the autopsy reports are never really legitimate and some ambulance, somewhere, must be delivering these people to him.  Deacon's character is so insane and yet so methodical that at times you wonder if he actually believes in what he's doing on a moral level.  Edgar Allan Poe would have been envious of what the director has accomplished here.  Though again not for everyone, fans of horror/psychological horror will have a good time with this film which one might even say is close to being a cult masterpiece.",5,Schindler has left the building!,1282176000,"08 19, 2010",2010,2983,"['Agnieszka', 'Wojtowicz-Vosloo', 'Afterlife', 'rare', 'film', 'certainly', 'not', 'being', 'feel', 'good', 'movie', 'week', 'serious', 'meditation', 'life', 'death', 'Actor', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'taken', 'decidedly', 'different', 'turn', 'career', 'Taken', 'A-Team', 'change', 'cinematic', 'scenery', 'role', 'Eliot', 'Deacon', 'funeral', 'home', 'director', 'character', 'last', 'name', 'most', 'certainly', 'accident', 'movie', 'not', 'frolicsome', 'most', 'crucial', 'events', 'happen', 'predictably', 'Deacon', 'very', 'own', 'after.life', 'funeral', 'home', 'unfortunately', 'practical', 'purposes', 'God', 'Christini', 'Ricci', 'one', 'favorite', 'actresses', 'who', 'was', 'somehow', 'not', 'surprised', 'see', 'here', 'Anna', 'Taylor', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'car', 'truck', 'stormy', 'night', 'argument', 'boyfriend', 'Paul', 'Coleman', 'Justin', 'Long', 'actor', 'emotional', 'reaction', 'time', 'brain', 'damaged', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'here', 'death-in-life', 'life-in-death', 'awakening', 'somehow', 'hands', 'Deacon', 'being', 'told', 'indeed', 'dead', 'breathes.Deacon', 'sort', 'netherworld', 'unholy', 'monastery', 'living', 'dead', 'chosen', 'profession', 'drugs', 'would', 'normally', 'be', 'reserved', 'corpse', 'Anna', 'personal', 'opinion', 'indeed', 'dead', 'Jimmy', 'Hoffa', 'Protesting', 'alive', 'people', 'always', 'say', 'samethings', 'Lording', 'compromised', 'psyche', 'one', 'can', 'tell', 'one', 'closely', 'actually', 'insane', 'enough', 'let', 'try', 'escape', 'sort', 'father', 'wounded', 'people', 'are', 'children', 'see', 'people', 'who', 'unlived', 'lives', 'are', 'finally', 'ready', 'make', 'plunges', 'face', 'what', ""'ve"", 'always', 'been', 'avoiding', 'death', 'indeed', 'part', 'Anna', 'fate', 'door', 'go', 'go', 'see', 'boyfriend', 'who', 'reality', 'situation', 'intermittently', 'never', 'punch', 'line', 'much', 'too', 'late', 'Ricci', 'character', 'bluntly', ""'m"", 'glad', ""'m"", 'glad', ""'m"", 'dead', 'Embalming', 'fluid', 'drenches', 'frame', 'movie', 'waterfall', 'can', 'smell', 'not', 'everyone', 'bleak', 'outlook', 'human', 'nature', 'even', 'higher-ups', 'pretty', 'obvious', 'somebody', 'police', 'department', 'working', 'Deacon', 'autopsy', 'reports', 'are', 'never', 'really', 'legitimate', 'ambulance', 'somewhere', 'must', 'be', 'delivering', 'people', 'Deacon', 'character', 'so', 'insane', 'yet', 'so', 'methodical', 'times', 'wonder', 'actually', 'what', 'doing', 'moral', 'level', 'Edgar', 'Allan', 'Poe', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'envious', 'what', 'director', 'accomplished', 'here', 'Though', 'again', 'not', 'everyone', 'fans', 'horror/psychological', 'horror', 'will', 'have', 'good', 'time', 'film', 'one', 'might', 'even', 'say', 'close', 'being', 'cult', 'masterpiece']",After.Life

It's about a teacher (Christina Ricci) that finds herself at a funeral home after a car crash. The funeral director (Liam Neeson) says she dead and that he can only talk to her because he has a gift. Is she really dead or is the funeral director a crazy serial killer that has taken her hostage ? Her boyfriend (Justin Long) isn't ready to say bye and thinks she's alive and wants to see the body but Neeson won't let him.While a creepy student (Chandler Canterbury) of Ricci's just hangs around the funeral home and he can also see her. Does he have a gift, is she alive or is he dead too ? The movie is hard to get through, so you might not even want to stick around to find out.

Driscoll,"[1, 2]","After.Life is a horror film directed by Agnieszka Wojtowicz-Vosloo; a director who clearly has an understanding of creating atmosphere and a distinct visual style, partially understands handling suspense effectively, but clumsily handles weaving a story within the medium of cinema.  She certainly has some talent in some areas so I won't sell her too short, but my thrusts at After.Life as a movie are at targets that are almost all directorial in essence.  Besides that what the hell is the deal with the dot between after and life in the film's title anyway?After.Life follows Anna (Christina Ricci), who dies in a car accident after a fight with her boyfriend Paul (Justin Long).  Or does she?  Funeral home proprietor Eliot (Liam Neeson) would have her believe that she is dead, but how on Earth can he be a credible source when he's telling her this and she's supposed to be dead?  Anyway, Paul freaks out because he can't see her one last time and some twists I won't spoil unfold from there.  Suffice to say, the twists are so very predictable that viewers with better imaginations than the writers of After.Life might walk away reading too far into this film, and think something far more clever happened.  Well, I'm sorry to say it didn't.Liam Neeson is great here but he's miscast and equipped with both the film's best dialogue and the film's worst.  He pulls off slumming it quite nicely as only truly great actors can.  Justin Long is either hit or miss with me and here he stinks, but Celia Weston is great as Anna's cold but grieving mother.  Then there is Christina Ricci.  I love Christina Ricci.  I think she is simply put the very best American actress at turning caricatures we should despise into lovable human beings.  She had great roles as a child, teenager, and stunted adolescent in movies likeThe Addams Family,Pumpkin,Monster, andThe Man Who Cried, among others.  She was outstanding especially with more recent roles inBlack Snake MoanandPenelope, a role that made me think of her once again as a female Johnny Depp.  It's a shame but now I'm beginning to think that Ricci might actually be incapable of playing adult characters in serious movies.  Her turn as Anna in After.Life simply does not work and the movie relies heavily on her performance.  It's crazy because before this movie I would've swooned that she should be playing Catwoman in Nolan's next Batman project instead of Anne Hathaway.  Perhaps her next feature will prove that her performance here was more about casting and direction than her acting chops, but Neeson survived so that might be a stretch.

She self medicated and fought with her boyfriend in a world of listlessness and aimless lack of purpose. One encounter in her life up until death was touching, her connection with one of her pupils. The young boy reached out to her and she was able to resonant warmth to his questions and desire for nurture. This was the only time that we see her get in touch with love. When she goes to meet with her boyfriend things again get dark. In a stormy nite, in frustration and rage she ends up in an accident. Earlier in the day she had went to a funeral and met up with a creepy director who followed her with his eyes. She wakes up in the basement of his funeral parlor, where he seems to be working on her white deathly pale body. He talks with her and tells her she is dead and that he can communicate with those who are in the afterlife before the transition. He has such disregard for those who die without the love of life and reeks contempt toward her. It is uncertain if Ricci is really dead, she doesnt believe him and this could be denial or it could be the truth. She breathes onto mirrors and it shows her breath warm the glass. Is it true, could  her death have been faked. Her boyfriend and her student wrestle with this thought. Something inside of them urges both to try to see if she is really dead before her funeral. Was it her spirit calling out to them from the place of pre transition or was it their intution. The movie reflects her process with the ongoing struggle with life and death. She reflects back upon her life and trys to reconnect with the realness and playfulness she had once shared with her boyfriend before time marched on in her polished unhappy life. Everything was perfect but not inside. The undertaker is able to see her flacid attempt at escape and lack of motivation to gain back her unlived life. The ending is eerie and somewhat ghoulish, the undertaker takes the small student under his wing using his innocent need for attention to turn his imagination into twisted fixations of burying someone alive.

1347031,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B003IY498Y,Mark Turner,"[1, 2]","I've seen so many thrillers, suspense films and horror films that is the rare occasion when one can surprise me or better yet make my skin crawl. I know, perhaps that's not an experience one might wish for. But I'm not talking about a movie that will revolt you like HOSTEL (which I hated), I'm talking about a movie that you know will stick with you, that will make you think and in so doing just give you a case of the willies. With the release of AFTER LIFE, a new film can be added to that list.The movie starts with a couple that seem to be having problems. Paul (Justin Long) is definitely in love with Anna (Christina Ricci) but her responses to him seem hesitant. The pair begin the film in bed with Anna seeming somewhat detached. It isn't until later that you know why.The film moves to her day as an elementary teacher. At school she helps out a student named Jack (Chandler Canterbury) when picked on by older kids. Later when she goes to leave the school, an ominous set of lights shutting down as she walks leaves one with a sense that something is going to happen. When Jack suddenly shows, everything is back to normal. Or is it? After all, we've watched Anna taking meds along the way.That night Anna and Paul are having dinner out, with Paul planning on making the big leap and proposing to her. But misunderstood cues lead to an argument and Anna leaving the restaurant. It is their last conversation as Anna ends up in an accident on the way home.Now the scene shifts to the eerie. Anna wakes to find herself on the mortician's table at the local funeral home run by Eliot (Liam Neeson). When she asks what she's doing here, he calmly tells her that she is dead. But Anna refuses to believe this even though she can't move. Eliot explains to her that everyone seems to face their mortality the same way, with a great amount of denial at first.The movie focuses mainly on the interplay between these two from here on out, with the occasional side trip to the world outside the funeral home doors. We see that Anna's mother, an overbearing invalid who wanted Anna there to take care of her forever, wasn't fond of Paul. We see Paul dealing with the death of a woman he truly loved. And we see Jack trying to figure out just what is going on in this odd world.But Eliot and Anna are involved in a back and forth discussion of life and death. Eliot takes to making speeches about how the living take for granted everything that they have. He continues to attempt to comfort Anna and ease her into the world of the hereafter. But Anna fights it all the way, clinging to life, or what she assumes is life.Scenes involving nightmares for both Anna and Paul leave you wondering where their heads are at the moment. And as the conversations between Eliot and Anna progress, as he injects her with a drug that is supposed to help ease her muscles now succumbing to rigor mortis, you start to wonder...is Anna really dead or not?And that becomes the creepiest part of this film. You watch and try to decipher any clues you are offered as you attempt to determine if Anna is really dead or not. And if she's not dead, why is it that Eliot continues to tell her that she is? What reason could he have for lying to her?I was afraid that this movie would have one of those trite endings where everything was hunky dory by the last reel. And then I was afraid that it would have one of those artsy endings where everyone dies. But, in fact, the end of this movie offers an ending that is acceptable, logical and terrifying all at the same time. More importantly, it's a satisfying ending.The look of the film is fantastic. The funeral home has a stately mansion look to it while the morgue in the basement has an antiseptic feel to it. The photography is wonderful with clear images to muddle the mind as you try to figure out the dead or not dead story.All of the actors do a great job here. Long seems truly despondent over the loss of his fianc&eacute;. Ricci seems confused and yet forceful in her belief that she is not dead. And Neeson gives a stand out performance as the subdued mortician who feels he has been given a gift to talk to the dead.I can see this film as one that will make viewers sit around and discuss it when it's over. It's one that will stick with you when the lights come on. And (unless you skip to the extras) you won't know the answer for sure even when the film finishes. And at times that can be a good thing. This movie might not be everyone's cup of tea, but I found it a movie that I didn't watch with my finger poised on the fast forward button. And for me, those films are truly rare these days.",4,LIVING OR DEAD?,1282780800,"08 26, 2010",2010,4636,"[""'ve"", 'seen', 'so', 'many', 'thrillers', 'suspense', 'films', 'horror', 'films', 'rare', 'occasion', 'when', 'one', 'can', 'surprise', 'better', 'yet', 'make', 'skin', 'crawl', 'know', 'perhaps', 'not', 'experience', 'one', 'might', 'wish', ""'m"", 'not', 'talking', 'movie', 'will', 'revolt', 'HOSTEL', 'hated', ""'m"", 'talking', 'movie', 'know', 'will', 'stick', 'will', 'make', 'think', 'so', 'doing', 'just', 'give', 'case', 'willies', 'release', 'AFTER', 'LIFE', 'new', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'added', 'list.The', 'movie', 'couple', 'seem', 'be', 'having', 'problems', 'Paul', 'Justin', 'Long', 'definitely', 'love', 'Anna', 'Christina', 'Ricci', 'responses', 'seem', 'hesitant', 'pair', 'begin', 'film', 'bed', 'Anna', 'seeming', 'somewhat', 'detached', ""n't"", 'later', 'know', 'why.The', 'film', 'moves', 'day', 'elementary', 'teacher', 'school', 'out', 'student', 'named', 'Jack', 'Chandler', 'Canterbury', 'when', 'picked', 'older', 'kids', 'Later', 'when', 'leave', 'school', 'ominous', 'set', 'lights', 'shutting', 'down', 'one', 'sense', 'something', 'going', 'happen', 'When', 'Jack', 'suddenly', 'everything', 'back', 'normal', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'Anna', 'taking', 'meds', 'night', 'Anna', 'Paul', 'are', 'having', 'dinner', 'Paul', 'planning', 'making', 'big', 'leap', 'proposing', 'misunderstood', 'cues', 'lead', 'argument', 'Anna', 'leaving', 'restaurant', 'last', 'conversation', 'Anna', 'up', 'accident', 'way', 'scene', 'shifts', 'eerie', 'Anna', 'find', 'mortician', 'table', 'local', 'funeral', 'home', 'run', 'Eliot', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'When', 'what', 'doing', 'here', 'calmly', 'dead', 'Anna', 'believe', 'even', 'ca', ""n't"", 'move', 'Eliot', 'everyone', 'face', 'mortality', 'same', 'way', 'great', 'amount', 'denial', 'first.The', 'movie', 'mainly', 'interplay', 'two', 'here', 'out', 'occasional', 'side', 'trip', 'world', 'funeral', 'home', 'doors', 'see', 'Anna', 'mother', 'overbearing', 'invalid', 'who', 'wanted', 'Anna', 'take', 'care', 'forever', 'was', ""n't"", 'fond', 'Paul', 'see', 'Paul', 'dealing', 'death', 'woman', 'truly', 'loved', 'see', 'Jack', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'just', 'what', 'going', 'odd', 'world.But', 'Eliot', 'Anna', 'are', 'involved', 'back', 'forth', 'discussion', 'life', 'death', 'Eliot', 'making', 'speeches', 'how', 'living', 'take', 'granted', 'everything', 'have', 'attempt', 'comfort', 'Anna', 'ease', 'world', 'hereafter', 'Anna', 'fights', 'way', 'clinging', 'life', 'what', 'life.Scenes', 'involving', 'nightmares', 'Anna', 'Paul', 'leave', 'wondering', 'where', 'heads', 'are', 'moment', 'conversations', 'Eliot', 'Anna', 'progress', 'drug', 'supposed', 'help', 'ease', 'muscles', 'now', 'succumbing', 'rigor', 'mortis', 'start', 'wonder', 'Anna', 'really', 'dead', 'not', 'creepiest', 'part', 'film', 'watch', 'try', 'decipher', 'clues', 'are', 'offered', 'attempt', 'determine', 'Anna', 'really', 'dead', 'not', 'not', 'dead', 'why', 'Eliot', 'tell', 'What', 'reason', 'could', 'have', 'lying', 'was', 'afraid', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'one', 'trite', 'endings', 'where', 'everything', 'was', 'hunky', 'dory', 'last', 'reel', 'then', 'was', 'afraid', 'would', 'have', 'one', 'artsy', 'endings', 'where', 'everyone', 'fact', 'end', 'movie', 'ending', 'acceptable', 'logical', 'terrifying', 'same', 'time', 'More', 'importantly', 'satisfying', 'ending.The', 'look', 'film', 'fantastic', 'funeral', 'home', 'stately', 'mansion', 'look', 'morgue', 'basement', 'antiseptic', 'feel', 'photography', 'wonderful', 'clear', 'images', 'muddle', 'mind', 'try', 'figure', 'out', 'dead', 'not', 'dead', 'story.All', 'actors', 'do', 'great', 'job', 'here', 'Long', 'truly', 'despondent', 'loss', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'Ricci', 'confused', 'yet', 'forceful', 'belief', 'not', 'dead', 'Neeson', 'stand', 'out', 'performance', 'subdued', 'mortician', 'who', 'been', 'given', 'gift', 'talk', 'dead.I', 'can', 'see', 'film', 'one', 'will', 'make', 'viewers', 'sit', 'discuss', 'when', 'over', 'one', 'will', 'stick', 'when', 'lights', 'come', 'skip', 'extras', 'wo', ""n't"", 'know', 'answer', 'sure', 'even', 'when', 'film', 'finishes', 'times', 'can', 'be', 'good', 'thing', 'movie', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'everyone', 'cup', 'tea', 'found', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'watch', 'finger', 'poised', 'fast', 'forward', 'button', 'films', 'are', 'truly', 'rare', 'days']",After.Life

I have nothing negative to say about the actors they all did their part. However, what can you say about a movie that honestly just isn't good. This is a psychological thriller that does little to make you think or play on the mind. You can honestly predict what is going to happen and that's never a good thing in psychological thriller. Your supposed to throw curves and keep the audience guessing and them blow them away with the conclusion. Nothing of the sort is to be seen here. The worse part of this mix in are awkward cheap spook you scenes. They don't fit in with the story and don't at all add in any relevant sense to the movie. With such a great cast I think the story should have been better. These actors were too good for this film. Without saying so much about the film (because there isn't much to say without spoiling the shallow plot) the best thing to do is skip it or watch it when it comes on cable. There's nothing note worthy about it and I honestly wish I spent my time watching something else. Bottom line great cast but horrible movie.

1347033,APMKMM6284FH4,B003IY498Y,Matt,"[3, 4]","I am going to discuss the thriller for and by nudists, After.Life.Here's the gist...Christina Ricci is a school teacher who is full of ennui and malaise. She takes pills and dates Justin Long and generally has a pouty vacant look on her face all the time, which we all know is the visual depiction of depression in moviedom. Christina Ricci is cold and mean to Justin Long but he is just so infatuated with that ""Precious Moments"" face of hers, he has to fight for the love. The love that is painfully absent and never really existed in the first place if flashbacks are to be believed. Oh yeah, Christina Ricci also has a creepy student who is apparently supposed to be the love child of Danny from The Shining.Anywho, depression and pills and the hysteria that comes with her lady parts causes Christina Ricci to get in an accident because we all know ladies can't drive. The next thing we know, Christina Ricci wakes up on a slab to Liam Neeson, the town's funeral director/mortician/creeper, leering over her and telling her she died in the accident. And Christina Ricci is all like ""Whuuuut?! Nuh uh!"" and Liam Neeson is like ""For real. Now I have to cut your clothes off so you can be naked for the next 90 minutes.""And that's it. The suspense for the rest of the film hinges on whether Liam Neeson is telling truth about Christina Ricci's new status as dead-but-sexy zombie-ghost or if she is actually alive and Qui Gonn is just a psycho.This film certainly asks you to make some leaps of logic. Like whatever town this is has the most inept emergency responders ever. This accident, which is supposed to be the worst car accident in the history of the world, results in Christina Ricci having a cut on her forehead. That's it. No bruises. No broken bones. Just a cut. On her forehead. Obviously, when the police and EMTs showed up, the rookie took one look at her and puked while the grizzled veteran said something like ""Poor bastard."" before they put her in a body bag and handed her over to the Nees. Or how about how Liam Neeson keeps injecting Christina Ricci with 10,000 CCs of ""muscle relaxer"" to prevent ""rigor""? Either Christina Ricci's school district has the laxest hiring requirements ever or she faked some credentials somewhere along the line because she is the dumbest teacher ever to fall for that bunk.This proves to be the undoing of the film. The filmmakers keep making it seem pretty obvious which way this thing is going to turn out but then throw in these inexplicable ""or is it?"" moments that make you reevaluate your previous assumptions. That's all well and good to keep the suspense going but the whole fun of these movies is the reveal at the end where they tell you what is really going on. That never comes in this movie. They just keep making u-turns on the path through the whole damn thing, to the very last frame. LAME.Liam Neeson gives a good performance and the film does have flashes of quality in it but it is ultimately disappointing. Justin Long is not charming or likable at all. Christina Ricci phones in her performance and let's her boobs do the talking on the other end of the line.

After pondering this question for some time, I think I finally figured it out. [NOTE: SPOILER ALERT FROM HERE ON IN MY REVIEW.]  But first, I want to say that I thought the movie was very well done. It had very realistic sets (esp. the mortuary), and the actors were superb--all top flight professionals and the big names, Christina Ricci and Liam Neeson, give grade A+ performances.  Neeson has that calm, if somewhat morbid demeanor that you expect in an undertaker. Ricci was excellent in her role as a somewhat troubled young woman who meets an untimely end; she was still so young and still had so much of life to figure out and live.  But this is why I believe she was really dead.  She had a fatal car crash! (As does her boyfriend at the end.) I think what the movie really depicts is what the thoughts of someone in Ricci's circumstances would have to say, and do if they could, once they meet their untimely end.  Of course the mechanism in the movie for this is Neeson's ""special ability"" to communicate with the dead (without that we would have no plot).  So, dear friends,the lesson the movie also shows is that we should live life to the fullest so that we won't have any last regrets like poor Christina's character did.",5,"Dead,...or Alive?",1332979200,"03 29, 2012",2012,1348,"['viewing', 'film', 'kept', 'wondering', 'Christina', 'Ricci', 'really', 'dead', 'alive', 'pondering', 'question', 'time', 'think', 'finally', 'figured', 'out', '[', 'NOTE', 'SPOILER', 'ALERT', 'FROM', 'HERE', 'ON', 'IN', 'MY', 'REVIEW', ']', 'first', 'want', 'say', 'thought', 'movie', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'had', 'very', 'realistic', 'sets', 'esp', 'mortuary', 'actors', 'were', 'superb', 'top', 'flight', 'professionals', 'big', 'names', 'Christina', 'Ricci', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'give', 'grade', 'A+', 'performances', 'Neeson', 'calm', 'somewhat', 'morbid', 'demeanor', 'expect', 'undertaker', 'Ricci', 'was', 'excellent', 'role', 'somewhat', 'troubled', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'untimely', 'end', 'was', 'still', 'so', 'young', 'still', 'had', 'so', 'much', 'life', 'figure', 'out', 'live', 'why', 'believe', 'was', 'really', 'dead', 'had', 'fatal', 'car', 'crash', 'boyfriend', 'end', 'think', 'what', 'movie', 'really', 'what', 'thoughts', 'someone', 'Ricci', 'circumstances', 'would', 'have', 'say', 'do', 'could', 'once', 'meet', 'untimely', 'end', 'course', 'mechanism', 'movie', 'Neeson', 'special', 'ability', 'communicate', 'dead', 'would', 'have', 'plot', 'So', 'dear', 'friends', 'lesson', 'movie', 'also', 'should', 'live', 'life', 'fullest', 'so', 'wo', ""n't"", 'have', 'last', 'regrets', 'poor', 'Christina', 'character', 'did']",After.Life

He's a sort of Charon, the mythic ferryman who conveyed the dead to Hades along the River Styx.But are the dead he's incising really dead? Or are his subjects merely dreaming him and their deaths? Or more disturbing still, is Neeson a serial killer who convinces his victims that they are dead while he starts the intimate process of stitching them, dressing them, applying make-up to them?Neeson skillfully combines the oily sympathy of a funeral director with the soft, sinister, convincing quality of a killer. So which is he? This film keeps us guessing - and then some. It layers anomaly on anachronism. In that respect, it's a little like ""The Shining"" in which all sorts of supernatural elements, from telepathy to reincarnation, were mixed so thrillingly that the viewer didn't notice the overall incoherence of it all. Here we get a similar random potpourri of mystic, mystifying elements.For example, there's the boy who's fascinated by the undertaker's art and who is becoming Neeson's sorcerer's apprentice. Having a youngster hovering wanly in the morgue is odd and unlikely enough by any interpretation of the movie's meaning. But then we see the boy at home. His mother appears too old and strangely desiccated to have borne him just ten or eleven years previous. But more puzzling still - while the movie as a whole is set in the present, with modern cars and all the modern conveniences - the boy's mother is seen staring at an episode of ""Beat the Clock"" on TV, a game show hosted by Bud Collyer and last aired in the mid 1950's. There's also a 1950's phone in the morgue. What are these brief time displacements supposed to mean? And what is that mysterious dot between ""After"" and ""Life"" doing in the movie title?Director Wojtowicz-Vosloo does supply a pat interpretation of the film in a brief bonus commentary. She says, ""Of course, the explanation is..."" I don't think there could be any ""of course"" about it though. There's no single interpretation that could cover all the actions and oddities of the characters in this film. The Director's reductionism detracts from the spell cast by the film.Despite there being a few too many conflicting spirits here, the film is haunting and poignant.

She gets in a car accident and ends up in Liam Neeson's funeral home. He's a total weirdo who thinks he can talk to the dead because the dead do not really know that they are dead.

1347050,A1KVBBRXQ2PWJ7,B003IY498Y,Siklootd,"[1, 2]","""After.Life"" is a unique viewing experience for fans of horror movies or anyone looking for a film with plenty of twists and mystery.  With actors such as Liam Neeson, Justin Long, and Christina Ricci, the film does contain a high quality set of actors that deliver their roles and emotions perfectly.  The story is graphic and full of mystery.  However, this is where the problem of the film begins: it's plot is two-sided, trying to play with the minds of the viewers on two different levels.Advertised as a ""supernatural horror"" film, ""After.Life"" tries to balance two different plot lines at the same time.  The story begins with an elementary teacher named Anna (Christina Ricci) who seems unsatisfied in her relationship with Paul (Justin Long).  She never appears interested in anything that Paul has to say, and it's quite obvious to the audience that the couple is having relationship problems.  After depicting the two of them in bed with one another, the film quickly cuts away to Anna at work, where a little boy seems to be a complete outcast from the class and from his own family.  The boy's name is Jack, and his only friend seems to be his teacher Anna.Anna has to leave for a funeral for her deceased music teacher and Jack wants to tag along to see his first funeral in person.  Anna persuades the child to go home, even though his mother is shown simply watching television in a trance, unaware of the existence of her own child as he comes home.  Once Anna arrives at the funeral, she meets the funeral director, Eliot Deacon (Liam Neeson).  Deacon appears to be fascinated with Anna.  She leaves the funeral home and goes to meet Paul for dinner.After Paul announces that he received a job offer in Chicago and would be moving, Anna goes into a fit of rage and storms out of the restaurant.  In her chaotic state of mind, she gets in a car crash and is pronounced dead on the scene.  The film cuts to the next scene, showing Anna lying on the metal gurney in the basement of the funeral home.  Anna's controlling and heartless mother blames Paul and appears unfazed by the sight of her dead daughter.Here's where the film tries to play to two different plot lines at once.  It appears as if Anna is not dead, seeing how she is capable of walking and talking, yet it seems as if only Deacon is capable of hearing her.  Paul does not think that Anna is dead, and is in a desperate struggle to prove that Deacon is not the man everyone thinks he is.  The film tries to make the audience think that Anna is in fact dead and that Deacon is the only character capable of speaking to her, while at the same time making the audience think that perhaps she isn't dead at all.The film's plot is quite difficult to understand at first, but with subtle hints here and there, it becomes clear what the truth about Anna's state of being truly is.  Liam Neeson does a great job of playing a role that feels quite out of character for man usually enlisted for roles in films like ""Taken"", ""Batman Begins"", ""Star Wars"" and ""The A-Team"".  However, he does a great job of portraying a dark, twisted character in a very convincing manner.  At times Liam makes Deacon into a character that the audience may feel sympathy towards, while in other scenes he is displays a creepy demeanor that can send chills down the viewer's spine with his actions.  The director and writer tried to make both sides of the plot feasible, however, this leads to a lot of distractions and confusion for the audience, and a second viewing is probably the best manner in which one can fully comprehend the film in its entirety.Some plot holes hold back the film from being truly spectacular, such as when Deacon is told to by Anna's mother to dye Anna's her back to its natural brown color, there are still scenes afterwards in which Anna is shown having red hair despite the fact that the film already had Deacon dye it back to brown.  These are details that the director probably should have paid more attention to when filming, but it's a minor annoyance more than anything else.Overall, the story of ""After.Life"" will keep the audience on their toes, guessing at every turn what will happen next.  Is Anna really dead and Deacon has the special ability to speak the deceased, as he suggests or is something deeper and more gruesome occurring?  ""After.Life"" is a film with enough suspense and mystery to warrant multiple viewings, all of which will provide further insight on the happenings of the story, making it even better as it begins to expand with each successive viewing session.  An excellent film with a dark, haunting ambience, powerful plot, and superior acting.

O'Blenis,"[1, 1]","A very different take on the 'buried alive' theme in horror that goes back centuries, ""After.life"" stars Cristina Ricci as a young schoolteacher who 'dies' in a freak automobile accident only to wake up alive and well in the town morgue.  Where she promptly meets the mortician/funeral parlor director (played by Liam Neeson), a haunted, weary man who explains to her that she is indeed deceased, the latest of a long line of deceased he's encountered who don't know they're dead, and because of his unique ability to see and interact with the dead, it's his job to prepare her for her imminent journey to the afterlife.What's real?  Is this scenario the truth, with Neeson a conductor of souls, or is he nuts or worse and Ricci is still alive, captive?  It sounds like this kind of scenario should fall apart in anything longer than a 20-minute segment of an anthology film but, surprisingly, it doesn't.  With great skill and suspense, it genuinely keeps the viewer guessing even as it keeps Ricci's character guessing.  She's initially convinced that the funeral home director is insane and she's very much alive, but begins to doubt.  The movie will throw a clue that indicates one conclusion, then minutes later throw a different hint that leads you back in the other direction.  All this while, Ricci's boyfriend (played by Justin Long), haunted by suspicions after one of her grade school students insists he's seen her alive, begins to search out whether something strange is going on, and wonders whether all his doubts are just the byproduct of grief and the guilt he's feeling over the fight they had the night of her death.This was probably difficult material to make convincing, but the filmmakers and cast did an excellent job with it.

And is Liam Neeson really so hard up that he has to resort to this? Perhaps they thought that it might attain cult movie status amongst necrophiliacs anxious to watch and re-watch while the camera lingers, time and time and time again, over the scarcely erotic corpse of Ricci lying recumbent on the embalmer's slab.Ricci's love interest, as someone else has already mentioned, uncannily resembles Keanu Reeves but at least he can act.

The part when I started watching was when Anna was in the funeral home, wakes up and wants to know what she's doing there. The funeral director tells her she is dead and he is there to help her accept her death and make the transition.  To help her...he does absolutely nothing, but put her down. When she says she can't be dead because she is breathing, he angrily says, ""You people!! Just because you're breathing, you think you're alive!"" (Or something to that effect.) He seems to despise dead people that he claims to have so much compassion for and want to help them to the other side. He always refers to them as ""You people!!"" He also is very negative: ""There is nothing left for you here.""Spoilers:However, I never thought she was dead. She was whacking things around, and the funeral director, Deacon, did not like this at all. He didn't like that she got up and walked around and argued with him. He seemed to have so much vested interest in her being dead, that I never believed anything he said. Deacon also became extremely nervous any time anyone else was around Anna. So I believed that she was alive and he was trying to make her think that she was dead, so that he could kill her and bury her, because he really liked doing that sort of thing.  The funeral home was in a creepy old mansion (which would have been good in an old scary movie), and he lived there also.  He had a bunch of photos of ""dead"" people on his bedroom wall that he talked to. He believed he was doing something useful in killing these people (or maybe he just enjoyed it and rationalized it as useful) because in  his opinion they weren't really living, and they were just taking up space that could be better used by people who really did want to live. And he, Eliot Deacon, is the one who got to decide all this.  Clearly a psychopathic egomaniac.The movie itself was not that great. Deacon would come into the room where the ""dead"" people were lying on metal gurneys, and kind of just walk around and not do very much. Not sure what his purpose was there.  He always locked the door, and it showed him turning down the thermostat to 40 degrees. It showed this several times, so apparently it got turned up again somehow.Anna's boyfriend Paul, who she manages to call on a rotary phone, appears to not be able to understand her. He becomes upset thinking it's a prank call. I guess he didn't have caller ID. (Deacon tells her no one can hear her but him.) Sometimes Paul thinks she's still alive and sometimes he thinks she's dead. He talks to the cops about it and they are very rude to him and treat him like a child. Even though one of them went to see his ""dead"" brother and saw Anna move. He apparently was too stupid for that to register in his brain.There is also a weird kid, Jack, who is one of Anna's students, and who sees her standing in her red slip in the window (with Deacon trying to convince her that she is dead).  Deacon convinces Jack that he also has the gift that Deacon has, which is to speak to the dead and help them on their way out of this life. He told him the first was his mother. So did Deacon kill his mother because she wasn't really living anyway?Anna gets brainwashed, without much effort, into thinking that she is dead. Deacon does keep shooting her up with stuff though, apparently making her weak and docile.  She never gets hungry and she never has to go to the bathroom. Still, in the back of her mind, she has that belief that she really is alive. When he offers her the chance to go see her boyfriend and tell him that she does love him, she can barely walk. Suddenly she is having some nightmare vision that a bunch of witch-like women are spitting on her and Paul is just standing there watching. Maggots come out of her mouth.

1347063,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B003IY498Y,Tsuyoshi,"[4, 5]","In the thriller ""After. Life"" (not ""Afterlife""), directed and co-written by Agnieszka Wojtowicz-Vosloo, Christina Ricci plays Anna Taylor, a twenty-something schoolteacher who, after a car accident in the rainy night, finds herself in a funeral home of a morgue director Eliot Deacon (Liam Neeson). There Mr. Deacon calmly informs Anna that she is dead - even though she thinks she is still alive.Just before the accident Anna had quarreled with her boyfriend Paul (Justin Long), who suspects that the local mortician has been hiding something from him. In the meanwhile, Anna attempts to ""escape"" from the basement room (her body still functions, it seems), ignoring what Eliot said, but one disturbing question is ... he might be really telling her truth.Not a bad idea for a supernatural / psychological thriller, but ""After. Life"" fails to deliver the goods. The problem with the film is simple. With its confusing narrative and flat characters, the film really does not know what it wants to be. A thought-provoking drama about life and death? A melodrama about two lovers? A quasi-supernatural thriller with twists and turns? Even those who are attracted to its premise (and I found it pretty interesting) will find the story too illogical to be taken seriously.More importantly, the film suffers under the weight of its own ambitions - or in short, pretentiousness. While it seems that ""After. Life"" thinks its conclusion very clever and even insightful, the fact is most audiences feel cheated or short-changed. What the meaning of her nose bleeding? What happened to her cell phone message? Also, the director heavily relies on clich&eacute;d devices in following the twist-ridden storyline. ""After.

I truly enjoyed this movie and thought it was pretty well done, maybe not the best movie of all time but most certainly not as terrible as it is made out to be. Let's be fair here and examine just a few gripes with the movie.First of all this movie is NOT a documentary, if you wanted to see how real dead bodies are examined then watch Dr.G THIS is not your movie. I am extremely sorry that you can't take something for what it is.Second is the plot holes, yes chances are that the body would go through WAY more examination to get to a mortuary table than just a few coroners and a quick medical examination but to be fair we are told that this is a small town and we are also made aware that Liam Niesson's character is fairly well liked and respected in the town. So would it really be out of the realm of possibility for him to have connections within the coroners office and or from medical examiners on the scene? What is the motivation? well it could be anything. I hope people do know that Morticians make quite a deal of money for what they do. Is it out of the realm of possibility to say that he could be bribing the medical examiner and coroner just so he could get his very sick jollies? I don't think so. Yeah the twist really wasn't all that well veiled but then again it wasn't all that poorly done either.I won't bore you with too much detail and give away too much but overall I would have to say that this is a refreshing look at the horror genre that has been on the slab for years. It's definitely not perfect but it's something new and different for a dying genre. If you can put yourself in the position of the character it is a very suspenseful movie with a lot of great imagery. My gripe is that it is extremely long and I thought it would have been better had it been shorter which may not have given the story AS much development but probably would have been better for those with short attention spans that need to watch things explode every 5 minutes. It does get a little muddled but I can say this film has a lot of character and redeemable qualities.",5,Oh Oh The Afterlife.,1314662400,"08 30, 2011",2011,2274,"['Yes', 'are', 'plot', 'holes', 'yes', 'are', 'quite', 'few', 'things', 'movie', 'probably', 'would', ""n't"", 'happen', 'real', 'life', 'then', 'again', 'think', 'why', 'call', 'movie', 'not', 'REALITY', 'truly', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'thought', 'was', 'pretty', 'well', 'done', 'maybe', 'not', 'best', 'movie', 'time', 'most', 'certainly', 'not', 'as', 'terrible', 'made', 'out', 'be', 'Let', 'be', 'fair', 'here', 'examine', 'just', 'few', 'gripes', 'movie.First', 'movie', 'NOT', 'documentary', 'wanted', 'see', 'how', 'real', 'dead', 'bodies', 'are', 'examined', 'then', 'watch', 'Dr.G', 'THIS', 'not', 'movie', 'am', 'extremely', 'sorry', 'ca', ""n't"", 'take', 'something', 'what', 'is.Second', 'plot', 'holes', 'yes', 'chances', 'are', 'body', 'would', 'go', 'WAY', 'more', 'examination', 'get', 'mortuary', 'table', 'just', 'few', 'coroners', 'quick', 'medical', 'examination', 'be', 'fair', 'are', 'told', 'small', 'town', 'are', 'also', 'made', 'aware', 'Liam', 'Niesson', 'character', 'fairly', 'well', 'liked', 'respected', 'town', 'So', 'would', 'really', 'be', 'realm', 'possibility', 'have', 'connections', 'coroners', 'office', 'medical', 'examiners', 'scene', 'What', 'motivation', 'could', 'be', 'anything', 'hope', 'people', 'do', 'know', 'Morticians', 'make', 'deal', 'money', 'what', 'do', 'Is', 'realm', 'possibility', 'say', 'could', 'be', 'bribing', 'medical', 'examiner', 'coroner', 'just', 'so', 'could', 'get', 'very', 'sick', 'jollies', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'so', 'Yeah', 'twist', 'really', 'was', ""n't"", 'well', 'veiled', 'then', 'again', 'was', ""n't"", 'poorly', 'done', 'either.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'bore', 'too', 'much', 'detail', 'give', 'away', 'too', 'much', 'overall', 'would', 'have', 'say', 'refreshing', 'look', 'horror', 'genre', 'been', 'slab', 'years', 'definitely', 'not', 'perfect', 'something', 'new', 'different', 'dying', 'genre', 'can', 'put', 'position', 'character', 'very', 'suspenseful', 'movie', 'lot', 'great', 'imagery', 'gripe', 'extremely', 'long', 'thought', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'had', 'been', 'shorter', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'given', 'story', 'much', 'development', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'short', 'attention', 'spans', 'need', 'watch', 'things', 'explode', '5', 'minutes', 'get', 'little', 'muddled', 'can', 'say', 'film', 'lot', 'character', 'redeemable', 'qualities']",After.Life
