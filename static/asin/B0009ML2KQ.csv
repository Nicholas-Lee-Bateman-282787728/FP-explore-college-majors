The memory of The High and the Mighty has stayed with me for all of the fifty years since 1954. In my opinion everything about this film is great. The actors the direction the music. It may sound over the top but to see this film again has been an emotional experience. I want to pay tribute to all who have been involved in the reissue. I waited a long time and I was not disapointed. It is one to watch again and again and that includes the excellent extras. My personal recommendation is...you must watch this film. You will enjoy it.

Imagine my surprise to find that it was really filmed in color!This is a film for great nostalgia as I felt when watching the movie with my family (so what if my kids pestered me to change the channel to Nick at Night).  So this is not a great movie or a great Wayne movie, but it is interesting as a picture that set the form for later disaster movies.  As is true with those later movies, this one over did some of the dramatics.What it comes down to, though, is John Wayne taking control only when he was most needed.  It was a quick scene, but as dramatic as the cavalry charging in one of his old westerns.  The viewer can watch and say ""YES!""I probably didn't agree with a quarter of Wayne's politics except for his genuine love of this country, but I watch actors for their work, not their politics.  John Wayne exuded character, deep rooted confidence and charisma.  That is the type of guy I want when trouble occurs.

908235,A2FL0EKQ2EQ9E6,B0009ML2KQ,"a viewer ""a viewer""","[10, 12]","Go with the majority on this one folks.  I am a classic film buff and I am very, very hard to please.  By no means am I an authority but I have a huge assortment of classic movies on DVD and VHS.  This film ranks among the best films Hollywood ever made and to use that time worn cliche', ""they simply do not make them like this anymore"".  What stands out here is that a film that has not been seen in nearly 50 years has been beautifully remastered thanks to the art of film preservation.  The colors are vibrant, the cinematography is spectactular, the acting is superb by everyone, and the screenplay is right on the money. Topping it off is the unforgettable musical score which won an Oscar for Dimitri Tiomkin.  The one star reviewer obviously only saw the picture once and could not appreciate it with one viewing!The movie is not boring in the least.  The characters are established from the beginning and we see their lives through flashbacks but the flashbacks are interspersed perfectly with the present.  We could not understand the characters were it not for the flashbacks.  And the flashbacks are very few, anyhow.The main focus of the story is ""survival"" in the midst of calamity in air travel during the fifties.  Full of suspense and real characterizations, the film holds up perfectly today and John Wayne holds the picture together.  Watch the scene where he talks to the passengers to inform them of their plight.  Also watch the dandy sequence and exchange between him and Robert Stack where Stack wants to ditch into the ocean and John Wayne smacks him!  Pure movie magic!!  And the whistling of the unforgettable song......ahhh.....folks, please enjoy this one!!  I am so grateful that it has been restored perfectly.  And there is also another disc full of dandy extras including:  John Wayne's film production company ""BatJac"" which produced the film and many others with actors testifying to Wayne's professionalism and kindness;  interviews with Karen Sharpe (the young married newlywed in the film), Doe Avedon (the Stewardess), the guy who played officer Hobie (I forgot what his name was) and Gonzales, Gonzales, the mexican dispacher.  There is a wonderful commentary too.  Also included is a William Wellman tribute, footage from the movie premiere in Hollywood, original theatrical and television trailers and a great documentary entitled ""Flying in the fifties"" with interviews from several Pilots and a Stewardess (as they used to be called then) about how things were back then at the beginning of aviation travel.  This DVD is well worth the price and a bargain at Amazon at only $13.49.  You can also get it at Walmart for $19.99.  Truly a film to add to your collection and one which you will watch over and over again!

908236,ANGH6401L9Y0T,B0009ML2KQ,"Barbara Frederick ""auntb93""","[1, 1]","This film is very much of its time, over 50 years ago. But if you can put yourself back in the days when the planes that flew from Hawaii to San Francisco used propellers and took 12 hours to make the trip, you can appreciate this movie.John Wayne is the co-pilot, even though he's had more experience than the pilot. Why? Because a couple of years earlier he had a terrible crash. Everyone on board except him died, including his wife and son. But he's still an excellent pilot, as this trip demonstrates.About the first half of the movie, we are getting to know the passengers, who are an interesting mix of people. Not racially mixed, though. There's one Chinese lady, but no blacks or Polynesians or other Asians, despite the fact that they are coming from Hawaii. There's one little boy flying alone because his father lives in Hawaii and his mother in San Francisco. The rest are adults, and we get to know them and their interactions pretty well, including the guy who brought a gun on board. (I TOLD you this was an old movie!) We find out why he brought the gun (hint: He's NOT a hijacker), which also tells us why he bought his ticket at the last minute.Then one of the propellers breaks off, lighting a fire in the fuel tank of the wing it is on. Can they make it to San Francisco that way, or have to ditch?With John Wayne at the controls, how can you doubt? But it is pretty harrowing, and gets very involved with the emotional states of everyone on board.",3,John Wayne's Rather Dated Airplane Drama,1337126400,"05 16, 2012",2012,1469,"['film', 'very', 'much', 'time', '50', 'years', 'ago', 'can', 'put', 'back', 'days', 'when', 'planes', 'flew', 'Hawaii', 'San', 'Francisco', 'used', 'propellers', 'took', '12', 'hours', 'make', 'trip', 'can', 'appreciate', 'movie.John', 'Wayne', 'co-pilot', 'even', 'had', 'more', 'experience', 'pilot', 'Why', 'couple', 'years', 'earlier', 'had', 'terrible', 'crash', 'Everyone', 'board', 'died', 'including', 'wife', 'son', 'still', 'excellent', 'pilot', 'trip', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'are', 'getting', 'know', 'passengers', 'who', 'are', 'interesting', 'mix', 'people', 'Not', 'racially', 'mixed', 'though', 'one', 'Chinese', 'lady', 'blacks', 'Polynesians', 'other', 'Asians', 'fact', 'are', 'coming', 'Hawaii', 'one', 'little', 'boy', 'flying', 'alone', 'father', 'Hawaii', 'mother', 'San', 'Francisco', 'rest', 'are', 'adults', 'get', 'know', 'interactions', 'pretty', 'well', 'including', 'guy', 'who', 'brought', 'gun', 'board', 'TOLD', 'was', 'old', 'movie', 'find', 'out', 'why', 'brought', 'gun', 'hint', 'hijacker', 'also', 'why', 'bought', 'ticket', 'last', 'minute.Then', 'one', 'propellers', 'breaks', 'off', 'lighting', 'fire', 'fuel', 'tank', 'wing', 'Can', 'make', 'San', 'Francisco', 'way', 'have', 'ditch', 'John', 'Wayne', 'controls', 'how', 'can', 'doubt', 'pretty', 'harrowing', 'very', 'involved', 'emotional', 'states', 'everyone', 'board']",The High and the Mighty
908237,A31I3HXMD5H1EL,B0009ML2KQ,Benjamin J Burgraff,"[13, 13]","""The High and the Mighty"", the granddaddy of air disaster movies, often falls into almost campy melodrama, but under the direction of the legendary 'Wild Bill' Wellman, and punctuated by one of Dimitri Tiomkin's most bombastic yet exciting scores (earning him an Oscar), the film maintains such a level of intensity that it remains constantly entertaining. With John Wayne heading an ensemble cast (including several co-stars from the past, as well as personal friends), it is certainly an essential for any 'Duke' film library.Produced by Wayne-Fellows Productions, and 'owned', eventually, by the Wayne family's Batjac Productions (along with ""Hondo"", ""McLintock!"", and ""Island in the Sky""), the film was a BIG hit, when released, and offered one of Wayne's better performances, then gained even greater stature as it was unseen for a generation. I've always held the belief that the family planned to release the entire quartet of films in 2007, to mark the centennial of Duke's birth, but two events changed the plan; first, an unauthorized, 'remixed' VHS version of ""McLintock!"" was released, with rumors that a version of ""Hondo"" was also in the works, forcing Michael Wayne, then President of Batjac, to release authorized VHS versions of the two films, rather than have the market glutted with bad copies; second, with Michael's death, in 2003, the Wayne family rethought the master plan, deciding to release the entire collection on DVD earlier. For whatever reason, seeing ""The High and the Mighty"" again is a cause to celebrate!Based on Ernest K. Gann's bestseller (which would inspire Arthur Hailey's later novel, ""Airport""), the story centers around a routine commercial flight between Honolulu and San Francisco, which becomes a life-and-death drama when one engine explodes, just beyond the 'Point of No Return'. With limited fuel, in deteriorating weather, the crisis brings out the best and worst in both passengers and crew.Wayne as the co-pilot, is quite good, playing a character older than he actually was (the role had been written for Spencer Tracy, who pulled out, just prior to filming); Robert Stack almost foreshadows his character in ""Airplane!"" as the no-nonsense pilot who goes ballistic when stressed. For cockpit 'overacting', however, the award has to go to Wally Brown, as the navigator, with his bugged-out eyes, visions of his shrewish wife, and WILDLY unruly hair...While the passengers are all stereotypes, several actors are quite good in their roles, with standout performances by Claire Trevor and Jan Sterling (both Oscar-nominated), Robert Newton, Paul Kelly, and Paul Fix. While Phil Harris attempts to inject humor into his role, it only works sporadically (and Ann Doran, as his wife, plays 'hysterical' so convincingly that you want to STRANGLE her!) Laraine Day, third-billed (and, with Trevor, a previous Wayne leading lady), is remarkably unlikable as a rich wife with a 'bought' husband (John Howard); Sidney Blackmer plays the 'mandatory' unbalanced type; and veteran character actor John Qualen adds another 'ethnic' portrayal to his long list, as a Latin family man (with a Norweigan accent!) A bit of trivia: The young boy onboard was portrayed by director Wellman's son!Almost as fascinating as the story is seeing how much has changed, since the film was released; the plane's 'tail' is controlled by pulleys and wires in a rear compartment; the sole flight attendant is a ""stewardess""; and everyone smokes (especially in the cockpit). On a more somber note, there is NO security, and one passenger boards easily, carrying a gun. It is, sadly, a wiser world, today...While no one would ever accuse ""The High and the Mighty"" of being a film classic, it's role in creating the 'airplane disaster' genre can't be denied, and it continues to be a vastly enjoyable John Wayne feature.It's great to have it back!",4,"Legendary  Wayne Disaster Film No Classic, But GREAT Entertainment!",1121817600,"07 20, 2005",2005,3863,"['High', 'Mighty', 'granddaddy', 'air', 'disaster', 'movies', 'often', 'almost', 'campy', 'melodrama', 'direction', 'legendary', 'Bill', 'Wellman', 'punctuated', 'one', 'Dimitri', 'Tiomkin', 'most', 'bombastic', 'yet', 'exciting', 'scores', 'earning', 'Oscar', 'film', 'maintains', 'such', 'level', 'intensity', 'constantly', 'entertaining', 'John', 'Wayne', 'heading', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'including', 'several', 'co-stars', 'past', 'as', 'well', 'personal', 'friends', 'certainly', 'essential', ""'Duke"", 'film', 'library.Produced', 'Wayne-Fellows', 'Productions', ""'owned"", 'eventually', 'Wayne', 'family', 'Batjac', 'Productions', 'Hondo', 'McLintock', 'Island', 'Sky', 'film', 'was', 'BIG', 'hit', 'when', 'released', 'offered', 'one', 'Wayne', 'better', 'performances', 'then', 'gained', 'even', 'greater', 'stature', 'was', 'unseen', 'generation', ""'ve"", 'always', 'held', 'belief', 'family', 'planned', 'release', 'entire', 'quartet', 'films', '2007', 'mark', 'centennial', 'Duke', 'birth', 'two', 'events', 'changed', 'plan', 'first', 'unauthorized', ""'remixed"", 'VHS', 'version', 'McLintock', 'was', 'released', 'rumors', 'version', 'Hondo', 'was', 'also', 'works', 'forcing', 'Michael', 'Wayne', 'then', 'President', 'Batjac', 'release', 'authorized', 'VHS', 'versions', 'two', 'films', 'rather', 'have', 'market', 'glutted', 'bad', 'copies', 'second', 'Michael', 'death', '2003', 'Wayne', 'family', 'rethought', 'master', 'plan', 'deciding', 'release', 'entire', 'collection', 'DVD', 'earlier', 'reason', 'seeing', 'High', 'Mighty', 'again', 'cause', 'celebrate', 'Based', 'Ernest', 'K.', 'Gann', 'bestseller', 'would', 'inspire', 'Arthur', 'Hailey', 'later', 'novel', 'Airport', 'story', 'centers', 'routine', 'commercial', 'flight', 'Honolulu', 'San', 'Francisco', 'life-and-death', 'drama', 'when', 'one', 'engine', 'just', ""'Point"", 'No', 'Return', 'limited', 'fuel', 'deteriorating', 'weather', 'crisis', 'out', 'best', 'worst', 'passengers', 'crew.Wayne', 'co-pilot', 'quite', 'good', 'playing', 'character', 'older', 'actually', 'was', 'role', 'had', 'been', 'written', 'Spencer', 'Tracy', 'who', 'pulled', 'out', 'just', 'prior', 'filming', 'Robert', 'Stack', 'almost', 'character', 'Airplane', 'no-nonsense', 'pilot', 'who', 'ballistic', 'when', 'stressed', 'cockpit', ""'overacting"", 'however', 'award', 'go', 'Wally', 'Brown', 'navigator', 'bugged-out', 'eyes', 'visions', 'shrewish', 'wife', 'WILDLY', 'unruly', 'hair', 'passengers', 'are', 'stereotypes', 'several', 'actors', 'are', 'quite', 'good', 'roles', 'standout', 'performances', 'Claire', 'Trevor', 'Jan', 'Sterling', 'Oscar-nominated', 'Robert', 'Newton', 'Paul', 'Kelly', 'Paul', 'Fix', 'Phil', 'Harris', 'attempts', 'inject', 'humor', 'role', 'only', 'sporadically', 'Ann', 'Doran', 'wife', ""'hysterical"", 'so', 'convincingly', 'want', 'STRANGLE', 'Laraine', 'Day', 'third-billed', 'Trevor', 'previous', 'Wayne', 'leading', 'lady', 'remarkably', 'unlikable', 'rich', 'wife', ""'bought"", 'husband', 'John', 'Howard', 'Sidney', 'Blackmer', ""'mandatory"", 'unbalanced', 'type', 'veteran', 'character', 'actor', 'John', 'Qualen', ""'ethnic"", 'portrayal', 'long', 'list', 'Latin', 'family', 'man', 'Norweigan', 'accent', 'bit', 'trivia', 'young', 'boy', 'onboard', 'was', 'portrayed', 'director', 'Wellman', 'son', 'Almost', 'as', 'fascinating', 'story', 'seeing', 'how', 'much', 'changed', 'film', 'was', 'released', 'plane', ""'tail"", 'controlled', 'pulleys', 'wires', 'rear', 'compartment', 'sole', 'flight', 'attendant', 'stewardess', 'everyone', 'smokes', 'especially', 'cockpit', 'more', 'somber', 'note', 'security', 'one', 'passenger', 'boards', 'easily', 'carrying', 'gun', 'sadly', 'wiser', 'world', 'today', 'one', 'would', 'ever', 'accuse', 'High', 'Mighty', 'being', 'film', 'classic', 'role', 'creating', ""'airplane"", 'disaster', 'genre', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'denied', 'be', 'vastly', 'enjoyable', 'John', 'Wayne', 'feature.It', 'great', 'have', 'back']",The High and the Mighty

I don't know what to tell you if you don't see this as camp. Some movies are timeless. This one is ungodly dated. One shallow stereotype follows another in this precursor to Airport and Airplane and the disaster movies made some two decades later. I'm not praising it for that dubious distinction, the original Airport was the only one even remotely good and Airplane spawned its own questionable genre.I'm praising it for its shock value. How about Paul Kelly as an alcoholic nuclear scientist, WOW! How about Phil Harris and Ann Doran declaring their ages to the ticket agent, she's 33 and I'm 38 when really they're 43 and 50 but look older than that. And what about that ticket agent, thanks for the info and if you know anything about me, just keep your mouth shut. Robert Stack acting is exactly that. The ethnic portrayals would be offensive if they weren't so incredibly lame, like Joy Kim saying ""My heart is just now returning from the sea."" Uh?Anyhow, all this goes to making this a howling good show. This would go over big at the Castro with an enthusiastic crowd or with the guys at the long defunked Mystery Science Theater 3000, what a time they could have with it.

908244,AUHG8KSHI529U,B0009ML2KQ,Craig Matteson,"[2, 2]","When ""The High and the Mighty"" came out in 1954 the vast majority of people had never been in an airplane.  In fact, heavier than air flight was only 51 years old (it has been 51 years since 1954!).  However, it was only nine years since the end of WWII and the year after the Korean War ended, the airlines were growing, and the public was starting to travel to exotic places like Hawaii in propeller airplanes (jet travel for passengers didn't follow until the fifties ended and the sixties were under way).This movie, dealing with a passenger flight that is at risk of having to ditch at sea, was a frightening concept to most people.  John Wayne produced the movie and was not supposed to have a role in the film.  However, Spencer Tracey turned down the Dan Roman role and Wayne took over.  The film was a huge hit and played for two years in New York's Time Square and was nominated for six Oscars&trade;.This movie also began a film genre that continued for decades and culminated in the Airport films of the 1970s and then became a parody in the Airplane! movies.  From out vantage point, when flying in an airplane is about as glamorous as riding in a bus to summer camp, the interior shots seem far too spacious (although seats were bigger in those days), the inside dimensions are just too big for prop planes or even today's jets.  The exterior shots of the plane bobbing in the wind and rain with engines roaring then switching to a quiet interior where people can whisper to each other and be heard would only be believed by anyone who had never flown (which was everyone in those days).  But this cutting was made very funny in the first Airplane! movie.This is a long film, about two and a half hours, and most of it focuses on the personal problems and relationships of the folks in the back of the plane, the crew, and how Wayne's washed up character fares with the Captain (Robert Stack) who disdains him.  All of this was copied again and again with different twists over the years and depends on the way these details hold the audience.

908251,A1FDW1SPYKB354,B0009ML2KQ,David Von Pein,"[3, 5]","1954's ""The High And The Mighty"", directed by William Wellman, has proven to be a tough movie for me to attach a specific grade to. I'm kind of stuck on the fence. I can certainly appreciate the several wonderful aspects of this good old-fashioned ""disaster-in-the-sky"" melodrama -- for example:> That irresistible Dimitri Tiomkin signature theme music used for the Main Titles.> The extra-wide ""CinemaScope"" framing of the film. This must have been one of the very first movies photographed in this wide aspect ratio, which measures a little wider than the 2.35:1 that I've seen advertised for this DVD. The Widescreen image measures 2.41:1 on my TV screen.> The bold, warm color photography (which looks absolutely terrific on this gorgeous 2-Disc ""Special Collector's Edition"" DVD, which represents this film's very first home-video release of any kind).> Some nice aerial shots of the four-engined propliner in flight.> A good tension-filled ""will they ditch or make it to the airport?"" climax.> A humorous bit part for Pedro Gonzales-Gonzales, who first appeared in the public eye as a very funny contestant on the Groucho Marx TV show, ""You Bet Your Life"", in 1953. That ""YBYL"" program with Gonzales-Gonzales is also available on DVD (via one of the multi-disc compilations of that TV series that has been issued by ""Shout! Factory""). A very funny episode too, with Pedro's last name(s) being the subject of a few of Groucho's sharp-tongued wisecracks.> Robert Stack getting bitch-slapped by big John Wayne.> And, of course, ""The Duke"" himself, which makes any film rise a little bit higher on the 'watchable' scale, just by seeing his name on the marquee. (John Wayne was 46 when he made this movie.)------------But, there are some drawbacks and debit points that counteract those plusses listed above (just in my own opinion of course). Debits such as:> The somewhat heavy and overdone background music during some portions of the movie. Although, as mentioned, the main theme is priceless and one-of-a-kind.> The awkward, choppy, and rather disjointed soap-opera-like storylines revolving around the airplane's passengers. Some of these ""mini dramas"" re. the 21 or 22 passengers on the Honolulu-to-San Francisco flight just don't ring very true. And some of these ""vignettes"" seem to spring up out of nowhere, without much rhyme or reason for them.At times, it seems as if the characters are delivering ""monologues"", rather than engaging in one-on-one conversations. Plus, there's the fact that very few of these 20+ people are really all that likeable.And the script is full of hot-and-cold inconsistencies......Laraine Day seems to be asking for the back of her husband's hand in some of her scenes here (although the hubby is very restrained when receiving Laraine's spiteful invective and keeps his hands off and his mouth shut during her theatrical tirades).But, via the magic of a movie script, Laraine's character does a complete (almost impossibly-fast) turnabout by the end of the film, as she suddenly becomes all smiles and kisses. Just didn't ring entirely true to me. But, as the saying goes, it's a woman's prerogative to change her mind. ;) (At any rate, it was nice seeing Laraine finally lose her frown and sour disposition and crack a smile near the tail-end of the picture.)Robert Newton's character goes through a similar transformation at the drop of a hat, too -- with Newton's fear of flying so great at the start of the film, he is gripped with terror at the slightest turning of the plane (so says the stewardess, who asks pilot Bob Stack to go and calm down this white-knuckled flyer). And yet, somehow, after the calamitous engine failure (and now facing the prospect of plunging to a watery grave), Newton is suddenly perfectly composed and unfrightened. Not the slightest bit on edge. He even helps to calm down another passenger aboard the plane. Remarkable. And unbelievable.> The lack of much ""background"" story provided on either one of the main pilots (Wayne or Stack). Via a third-party acquaintance of ""Dan Roman"" (Wayne), we do hear the story of how Roman got his bum leg in an earlier airplane crash which he, alone, survived. But other than one very brief ""flashback"" showing Wayne emerging from some burning wreckage, we really don't get involved at all in Wayne's character. And that's a pity. Because I think more background/flashback scenes with Wayne would have elevated his part more and would have benefitted the script better than, say, the weak subplot attached to comedian Phil Harris' character (and his hysterical wife, whom I'm guessing many viewers of this film wished had gone down in the sea by the final reel).> Robert Stack's character is another negative IMO. I think Robert did a good job with his role here however. But, for most of the film, it looked like Stack was either ready to (pardon the pun) blow his ""stack"", or to spit nails. I guess maybe Bob picked the wrong week to stop sniffing glue or something. (Oops, wrong airplane flick.) ;)> And that little boy who must have taken a whole bottle of sleeping pills before boarding ""Flight #420"". He never wakes up throughout the whole tumultuous ordeal in the air! This kid sleeps through turbulence, screaming passengers all around him, gun-waving fisticuffs in the aisle, and even the no-doubt deafening roar of having one of the plane's doors opened while in flight (yet another ""can you imagine this today?"" moment in the picture -- a cabin door being opened while in flight to lighten the aircraft's load by tossing all the luggage into the Pacific Ocean!). It's a rather humorous notion today indeed...especially when you consider that you'd be sucked out of the plane instantly if you were to crack open the hatch of a Boeing 747 while the plane is in the air and pressurized.I suppose, however, the fact that Flight 420 only reached a fairly-low maximum altitude of 8,000 or 9,000 feet (per the lone stewardess' remarks made to a passenger at the start of the flight) made the safe opening of a door a realistic part of the screenplay. But it's kind of funny to see it nonetheless.> The overlength of the movie (2 hours, 27 minutes). It could have been tightened-up and had at least 30 to 40 minutes chopped out of it, and it still wouldn't have been any the worse for wear as a result of such trimming, IMHO.------------So, when the reviewing dust has settled, I think I'm right about in the ""3.5 to 3.75 Stars"" range for ""The High And The Mighty"". That grand theme song deserves a full ""5 Stars"" though. And via this disc's rich Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround soundtrack, the opening credits are blissful. There's a DD 2.0 Surround track too. No Mono track offered up however. The title theme also can be heard (on a continuous loop) while the DVD's Main Menu is on the screen. Sounds darn good there as well.On a different note ......This film can be a pretty funny experience to watch in today's 21st-century environment (which is filled with fears of terrorists slipping aboard commercial jetliners and the stringent security at all U.S. airports). But in ""Mighty"", passengers can just walk aboard Hawaii-to-California flights armed with handguns in their coat pockets, with one such disgruntled passenger in the movie doing just that, as he packs a rod on the plane in the hope of settling a score with a fellow passenger while in flight. And even after the gun is taken away from this guy in a fight, not a thing is done by the Captain or the crew about the weapon for the duration of the flight -- with the gun-wielding passenger even getting back his pistol by the end of the movie. Can you picture that in your mind today?! You can't even take a plastic butter knife on board an airplane nowadays. LOL.And then there's the unintended ""smoking"" humor provided throughout the film. Passengers and (especially) the cockpit crew are just a-smokin' the cigarettes like chimneys during their flight to San Francisco! Obviously, this was indeed commonplace in the 1950s. But it's another example of how ""dated"" movies of such an era can become. Can you imagine seeing your pilot and co-pilot emerging from the cockpit, both of them puffin' away on their Camels and Winstons while the plane is in the air? :)It's difficult to not compare ""TH&TM;"" with other disaster outings that would follow in its wake (""wake turbulence"" even?). Such as ""Airport"" (from 1970), which in my view has more positive things going for it, and is a better film (overall) than this one. For one thing, the ground-based airport scenes in ""Airport"" are far superior to those in ""TH&TM;"". Plus, I believe the story and character development in that later aviation flick are better too.------------This double-disc DVD edition of ""The High And The Mighty"" contains a goodly amount of bonus features (in addition to the great-looking Anamorphic Widescreen video transfer of the movie on Disc 1). There's a multi-person Audio Commentary Track for the film on the first disc, while Disc #2 contains a wealth of supplementary material -- including a multi-part ""Making Of"" program, an aviation featurette, newsreel footage of the film's 1954 premiere, trailers, introductions by film critic Leonard Maltin, and a photo gallery.One of the bonus items is a 23-minute featurette called ""Flying In The Fifties"", which contains interviews with some old-time pilots and some vintage film footage of a few of the airliners from that era, including the majestic-looking ""Constellation"". One of the retired pilots made a quip during this program that had me chuckling. When reflecting on the question of why he became an airline pilot, he said -- ""Where else are you going to get a job where they give you a multi-million-dollar airplane, fill it full of booze and women, and send you out of town?"" ~LOL~------------A Last ""Mighty"" Word (or two).......Warts and all, ""The High And The Mighty"" still has the capacity to entertain an audience, and will immerse the viewer in high-flying, peril-filled, 1950s-style drama for nearly two-and-a-half hours.So hop aboard Flight 420 to San Francisco and fly along with John Wayne. Or, better yet, just pick up a copy of this beautiful and well-crafted 2-Disc DVD set from Paramount Home Entertainment. It should easily satisfy anybody's ""High & Mighty"" cravings.",4,"John Wayne ... An Airliner In Trouble ... And That Memorable Theme Song ...

This dreadful film simply does not stand up. The script is hopeless and while some of the acting is OK (Jan Sterling, Laraine Day and Phil Harris of all people), most is awful (Robert Stack takes the booby prize). This is not an aviation thriller, even if the prescursor to later and much better ""Disaster Movies"", but a multi-star melodrama in the vein of ""Grand Hotel"" or ""Executive Suite."" It is a long hard slog with excruciating dialogue and cliched corny situations. John Wayne survives simply because his part is relatively small and he retains a degree of sobriety. The film is hilarious if one thinks of ""Flying High."" The director William Wellman does a competent job of holding all the multiple subplots together but as a director who specialised in action packed aviation films, surely he was dispirited by the histrionics (or lack thereof).  The best thing is the epic theme music which justly won an Oscar.The good news, however, is that the print has been lovingly restored and the colour and sound are spectacular. There are many extras included in the package but they are surprisingly lacking in much detail and rather dull.All in all, this is a fair package of a genuine dud.

908266,AKKSHEGRQVQRK,B0009ML2KQ,Great Movie Addict,"[15, 18]","Cable tv will chop THATM to pieces and play it to death, with massive damage from commercials and banners. For many Baby Boomers this chestnut is a kind of 23rd Psalm, leaving everyone under 50 seriously puzzled: there's only one explosion (mostly off camera), no car chases, no bodies flying thru fake-glass windows in slo-mo, and most scenes actually last longer than 5 seconds.  Logical left-brainers will scoff, right-brainers will drool, and A.D.D. victims will go bananas during Wellman's skillfully orchestrated, uncut scenes. Yet 50+ years sees this old hit chugging along -- like Dan Roman it limps a bit but comes through in grand style. Director Wellman and a Warner cast and crew are still on course; small touches, much detail, great camera work, old-pro acting and pure schmaltz keep its ripe corn aloft without the need for preposterous aerial acrobatics or singing nuns in Max Factor Lite with carry-on guitars. Yes, there are goofs: an airline clerk claims the plane is overloaded, but it's not half booked. A fuselage exit door opens in the wrong direction. The soundtrack seems frantic at times, and today's airline screw-ups are so common that the '54 passengers seem unduly grim at being inconvenienced - though the actual risks are too, too real. Yessir, near the end there's a politically incorrect crucifix (shown twice).  Some shots of the plane reveal a non-computer-generated model (a 1954 audience might ask, ""What's a computer""?). You watch as if from a time capsule, often skeptically: Doe Avedon is an impossibly classy stewardess, Robert Stack is more berserk than simply fearful, nearly everyone on board is at a suicidal crossroad, and today many 50's sensibilities seem suspect or merely baffling (but dig Paul Kelly's crisp anti-proliferation rant, anticipating the 60's, and remember during the purposely sappy exchange between newlyweds that the word ""pregnant"" was verboten in 1954). Yet THATM, though formulaic then, achieves High Camp at each playing, with a human spirit far more involving than its goofy, even more generic imitators. You either hate it (born after 1950) or you're fascinated.  The DVD print is good, often supurb. The sometimes pale, reprocessed WarnerColor (Ansco/Eastman) looks great now.  Tiomkin's great Oscar winning score is intact, if at times a bit harshly ""digitized"" -- play it with Dobly 5.1, and you're in for a treat. The DVD extras make a great package, even if the runtime commentary sorely needs editing.  6 Oscar nominations.  Warning: Visually THATM really suffers on tv, needs a big screen -- if your player lets you blow up the image a bit, it's a vast improvement. Myth: when slapped, Robert Stack never says ""Thanks. I needed that"" (watch the movie for the actual line). 50 years ago, viewers expected more for their time and money than a comic book of special effects; in this case, there's a great collection of talent and narrative, and Wayne and Wellman keep it fueled and magically integrated. Get a load of the well-played scene between Wayne and Campbell during the ditching prep -- along with many other memorable scenes not likely to appear in today's megabuck 'FX-only' frenzies. And those last few seconds with JW and Regis Toomey are still a classic grabber.

The routine aspect disappears just halfway into the flight.First, the plane has episodes of vibration. Then a passenger shoots at another, puncturing fuel tanks and setting one of the engines on fire. The fire goes out, but the engine is not only disabled but also distorted, causing additional drag on the plane. The crew is frank with the passengers about the magnitude of the emergency. For now, the crew manages to keep the plane airborne.Some passengers are horror-stricken. Others resort to gallows humor. One woman, for instance, faces her impending death with the satisfaction that she will never have to be an old woman.

As many other reviewers have already summarized the main plot points, I'll skip that in my own review and stick to a brief recommendation that you won't be disappointed by it.John Wayne is in the movie, and he is obviously the star (followed closely by a young and incredibly interesting Robert Stack), and yet he doesn't overwhelm the movie with an over-the-top performance. In other words, the viewer won't be thinking to him or herself, ""how much Duke is too much Duke?""The other characters' back-stories and various crisises are total cliches now, though at the time of the movie's release they were probably more original. Original or hackneyed, the assorted personal dramas and physical air disaster are still interesting.The main musical score is memorable and very listenable, but the rest of the score seems a bit ""too obvious"" and bombastic when there's a dramatic point in the film, or an emotional moment. As in, ""oh, the music got really, really romantic, so this should be a romantic scene."" Some of the dialog also seems contrived, though again, the movie is still very interesting.Some of the language and stereotypes might not go over too well today, but in the context of the film are acceptable.Examples:- everyone, especially the flight crew, seems to be smoking cigarettes, even onduty- stereotyped gender roles, especially in terms of calm men and hystericalwomen- the only asian passenger in the movie is a quiet, extremely respectful womanwho speaks perfect english, but does so in a ponderous manner to variousAmericans who condescend to her, and she is given to reflecting in astereotypical fashion on her culture and past.- the southern-european fisherman passenger is given to wild gesticulationswhenever he speaks, and might as well be rolling pizza dough the way theyportray him- the stewardess (as flight attendants were then called) jokingly refers to theaverage American girl as a ""retard.""These stereotypes, even though they're in the movie, still don't detract from the entertainment value of the film -- in fact, they help put it into the historical context of the time it was made, and the situation it was depicting.the DVD extras, far from being ""throwaway"" and a mere hike on the price of the movie you really want to pay for, are actually very interesting, especially the mini-documentaries on John Wayne's film company, and the history of passenger flight in the 1950s.",5,Highly entertaining movie; excellent DVD package,1143504000,"03 28, 2006",2006,2534,"['High', 'Mighty', 'very', 'entertaining', 'film', 'well', 'two', 'hours-plus', 'get', 'many', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'already', 'summarized', 'main', 'plot', 'points', ""'ll"", 'skip', 'own', 'review', 'stick', 'brief', 'recommendation', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed', 'it.John', 'Wayne', 'movie', 'obviously', 'star', 'followed', 'closely', 'young', 'incredibly', 'interesting', 'Robert', 'Stack', 'yet', ""n't"", 'overwhelm', 'movie', 'over-the-top', 'performance', 'other', 'words', 'viewer', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'thinking', 'how', 'much', 'Duke', 'too', 'much', 'Duke', 'other', 'characters', 'back-stories', 'various', 'crisises', 'are', 'total', 'cliches', 'now', 'though', 'time', 'movie', 'release', 'were', 'probably', 'more', 'original', 'Original', 'hackneyed', 'assorted', 'personal', 'dramas', 'physical', 'air', 'disaster', 'are', 'still', 'interesting.The', 'main', 'musical', 'score', 'memorable', 'very', 'listenable', 'rest', 'score', 'bit', 'too', 'obvious', 'bombastic', 'when', 'dramatic', 'point', 'film', 'emotional', 'moment', 'oh', 'music', 'got', 'really', 'really', 'romantic', 'should', 'be', 'romantic', 'scene', 'dialog', 'also', 'contrived', 'though', 'again', 'movie', 'still', 'very', 'interesting.Some', 'language', 'stereotypes', 'might', 'not', 'go', 'too', 'well', 'today', 'context', 'film', 'are', 'acceptable.Examples', 'everyone', 'especially', 'flight', 'crew', 'be', 'smoking', 'cigarettes', 'even', 'onduty-', 'stereotyped', 'gender', 'roles', 'especially', 'terms', 'calm', 'men', 'hystericalwomen-', 'only', 'asian', 'passenger', 'movie', 'quiet', 'extremely', 'respectful', 'womanwho', 'perfect', 'english', 'so', 'ponderous', 'manner', 'variousAmericans', 'who', 'condescend', 'given', 'reflecting', 'astereotypical', 'fashion', 'culture', 'past.-', 'southern-european', 'fisherman', 'passenger', 'given', 'wild', 'gesticulationswhenever', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'be', 'rolling', 'pizza', 'way', 'theyportray', 'him-', 'stewardess', 'flight', 'attendants', 'were', 'then', 'called', 'jokingly', 'refers', 'theaverage', 'American', 'girl', 'retard', 'stereotypes', 'even', ""'re"", 'movie', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'detract', 'entertainment', 'value', 'film', 'fact', 'help', 'put', 'historical', 'context', 'time', 'was', 'made', 'situation', 'was', 'depicting.the', 'DVD', 'extras', 'far', 'being', 'throwaway', 'mere', 'hike', 'price', 'movie', 'really', 'want', 'pay', 'are', 'actually', 'very', 'interesting', 'especially', 'mini-documentaries', 'John', 'Wayne', 'film', 'company', 'history', 'passenger', 'flight', '1950s']",The High and the Mighty
908283,AWJJV7SHBQSXO,B0009ML2KQ,Karen P. Rhodes,"[1, 1]","This movie made me a Robert Stack fan.  I first saw it on TV in the late 1950s, when I was ten or eleven years old, and thought it was an excellent movie.  This was not long before Robert Stack created the role of Eliot Ness on TV in ""the Untouchables."" The High and the Mighty set the mold for airliner-disaster movies, notably the Airport series of films, which to my mind came nowhere near this one.  (And Airplane! is as much a satire of The High and the Mighty as it is of the Airport movies, and possibly owes more and pays more homage to this movie than to those later ones.)The High and the Mighty is an old-fashioned character study, showing the reactions of flight crew and passengers to an extreme emergency situation.  It is the finest of its kind, and no one came anywhere near it until nearly fifty years later with another excellent disaster film, which depicted a true story and a truly heroic one, and that is Apollo 13.  In those crucial few minutes as the airplane reaches the coast, but experiences a communications blackout, I thought immediately of those tense minutes during the real Apollo 13 event, when the astronauts were in a communications blackout and we wondered if they were going to make it.  The High and the Mighty has the same edge-of-your-seat quality.  I made a transcontinental flight about three years after having seen The High and the Mighty on TV, flying from my home in Florida to visit relatives in California.  That flight was in a four-engine, propeller-driven airliner (jets were just coming on line as passenger aircraft and were not serving smaller airports yet), and I was mindful of the movie from one coast to the other.I just saw this film again on our Amazon Prime account, on our 47-inch TV, and it was the first time I had seen it in color.  It's beautiful.  The characters are played by accomplished actors, making it a wonderful study.  I was alwas happy to see John Wayne in parts that had more depth than his usual cowboy or soldier action-adventure fare, and next to The Shootist, this is his finest two-and-a-half hours.  It's on my wish list, and I think 'm getting it for Christmas tomorrow.  I'm excited!Robert Stack always was a restrained and subtle actor, one who makes you watch him to see what he's doing.  The restraint in his performance most of the way through the movie makes his fear believable when the time comes for him to begin falling apart.  It also enhances his joy when it does look like the airplane will make it safely to the ground.Today, there is too much emphasis in movies on external action, shoot-em-up, overt sex.  This movie stands out even more than fifty years later as an insightful character study.  I also read Ernest K. Gann's book, on which this movie is based, and the film was as faithful to the book as any I've seen.  I recommend that fans of this film, or people who just appreciate it, read Gann's book, too.  That will make the movie experience even better.",5,The mold for the airliner-disaster movie,1356307200,"12 24, 2012",2012,2965,"['movie', 'made', 'Robert', 'Stack', 'fan', 'first', 'saw', 'TV', 'late', '1950s', 'when', 'was', 'ten', 'eleven', 'years', 'old', 'thought', 'was', 'excellent', 'movie', 'was', 'not', 'long', 'Robert', 'Stack', 'created', 'role', 'Eliot', 'Ness', 'TV', 'Untouchables', 'High', 'Mighty', 'set', 'mold', 'airliner-disaster', 'movies', 'notably', 'Airport', 'series', 'films', 'mind', 'came', 'nowhere', 'one', 'Airplane', 'as', 'much', 'satire', 'High', 'Mighty', 'Airport', 'movies', 'possibly', 'more', 'more', 'homage', 'movie', 'later', 'ones', 'High', 'Mighty', 'old-fashioned', 'character', 'study', 'showing', 'reactions', 'flight', 'crew', 'passengers', 'extreme', 'emergency', 'situation', 'finest', 'kind', 'one', 'came', 'anywhere', 'nearly', 'fifty', 'years', 'later', 'excellent', 'disaster', 'film', 'depicted', 'true', 'story', 'truly', 'heroic', 'one', 'Apollo', '13', 'crucial', 'few', 'minutes', 'airplane', 'coast', 'communications', 'blackout', 'thought', 'immediately', 'tense', 'minutes', 'real', 'Apollo', '13', 'event', 'when', 'astronauts', 'were', 'communications', 'blackout', 'wondered', 'were', 'going', 'make', 'High', 'Mighty', 'same', 'edge-of-your-seat', 'quality', 'made', 'transcontinental', 'flight', 'three', 'years', 'having', 'seen', 'High', 'Mighty', 'TV', 'flying', 'home', 'Florida', 'visit', 'relatives', 'California', 'flight', 'was', 'four-engine', 'propeller-driven', 'airliner', 'jets', 'were', 'just', 'coming', 'line', 'passenger', 'aircraft', 'were', 'not', 'serving', 'smaller', 'airports', 'yet', 'was', 'mindful', 'movie', 'one', 'coast', 'other.I', 'just', 'saw', 'film', 'again', 'Amazon', 'Prime', 'account', '47-inch', 'TV', 'was', 'first', 'time', 'had', 'seen', 'color', 'beautiful', 'characters', 'are', 'played', 'accomplished', 'actors', 'making', 'wonderful', 'study', 'was', 'alwas', 'happy', 'see', 'John', 'Wayne', 'parts', 'had', 'more', 'depth', 'usual', 'cowboy', 'soldier', 'action-adventure', 'fare', 'next', 'Shootist', 'finest', 'two-and-a-half', 'hours', 'wish', 'list', 'think', ""'m"", 'getting', 'Christmas', 'tomorrow', ""'m"", 'excited', 'Robert', 'Stack', 'always', 'was', 'restrained', 'subtle', 'actor', 'one', 'who', 'watch', 'see', 'what', 'doing', 'restraint', 'performance', 'most', 'way', 'movie', 'fear', 'believable', 'when', 'time', 'begin', 'falling', 'apart', 'also', 'joy', 'when', 'look', 'airplane', 'will', 'make', 'safely', 'ground.Today', 'too', 'much', 'emphasis', 'movies', 'external', 'action', 'shoot-em-up', 'overt', 'sex', 'movie', 'out', 'even', 'more', 'fifty', 'years', 'later', 'insightful', 'character', 'study', 'also', 'read', 'Ernest', 'K.', 'Gann', 'book', 'movie', 'based', 'film', 'was', 'as', 'faithful', 'book', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'recommend', 'fans', 'film', 'people', 'who', 'just', 'appreciate', 'read', 'Gann', 'book', 'too', 'will', 'make', 'movie', 'experience', 'even', 'better']",The High and the Mighty
908284,ABLOQZIL42W7I,B0009ML2KQ,"kone ""kone""","[28, 30]","Fans of John Wayne have waited nearly 25 years for the release of ""The High And The Mighty"", a movie starring Duke Wayne that was originally released in theatres in 1954. It was last viewed on TV in 1981-1982, after which the rights to the movie were tied up by the Wayne family. The movie then languished in the Wayne film vault, suffered major water damage, and one reel of the three-reel movie was lost for sometime(!). Fortunately, the missing reel was found, the water damage meticulously restored to its Technicolor brilliance, and now it has finally been released on DVD in August of 2005. The question is: Is this movie as good as everyone remembers, and was it worth the wait?The answer to the above questions is a resounding ""Yes""! ""The High and The Mighty"" is as good as fans remembered; I don't put it in Wayne's top-10, but it is not too far behind (therefore 4 of 5 stars). Wayne is handsome and engaging as the co-pilot of a damaged plane flying over the Pacific Ocean from Hawaii to San Francisco. Wayne certainly does not dominate the film, as the lives and backgrounds of many other characters on the plane are slowly brought to life. I say ""slowly"" because the film takes about 75 minutes to set all the characters in place before the mid-air crisis develops. The film then becomes a character study of how all the passengers and crew deal with the liklihood of crashing into the drink. The diversity of characters and their emotional reactions to the crisis keeps one's interest throughout the more than 2-hour long film.This was the first real ""disaster"" film, and it set the stage for many others in this genre (Airport, Airport 1975, and the immensely funny spoof Airplane).The DVD comes with a companion disk that is about 75 minutes long and contains interesting background information about the film's history, how it was restored, etc. It is interesting and entertaining, but the real star here is of course the movie itself.I recommend buying it. It makes great family entertainment and even younger kids will like it. The special effects are amazingly simple and primitive compared to today's technology, but one buys the movie for John Wayne's performance, and for this reason it is more than worth the $14.95 asking price.

You had a period shortly before that with older leading men, John Garfield and Paul Muni; Fred MacMurray as a straight guy. Jimmy Stewart and Tyrone Power. Robert Taylor in the Medieval dramas. And of course, John Wayne, the Duke. Truly a man larger than life. (My favorite was ""The Searchers"" with a skinny Natalie Wood, but High and Mighty is an awfully close second.)The High and the Mighty was a fantastic movie however the Ernie Gann's novel gave it more beef. Robert Stack was a Korean War ace and hero but more burned out than his copilot by the rigors of the war. Wayne of course had lost his family in a crash years earlier and there was a generational tension between Wayne, who had cut his teeth (if I remember correctly) in the Eddie Rickenbacker ""Hat-in-the-Ring"" squadron at the close of World War I. To a large extent, he's given the job as copilot out of kindness because he is the old pelican, and time and luck has passed him by. Hence his own reluctance to talk the skipper, Stack, out of ditching in an angry sea when the stuff has hit the fan.The discovery of 'who they REALLY are' by the passengers, the arrogant becoming cowards, the shallow becoming Homeric, is really a brilliant subplot against the canvas of the doomed airliner.The scene that stayed in my mind for 40 years plus is the scene where the coffee service is being prepared and the Flight Attendant, kneeling down before the steel kitchen cabinet,  looks up to see the coffee splatter from an unseen, unheard shimmy. Brrrr.Great movie for everything. And the theme from the High and The Mighty from Dimitri Tiomkin - I don't know what else he did but that theme stayed with me for 40 years plus too. 5 stars.

908289,A1H3ZATBDMOJ6Z,B0009ML2KQ,Louis Barbarelli,"[12, 13]","I saw this movie when it was first released.  I was 12.  I remember being amazed even then at how effectively the cinematographer utilized the ultra-wide screen even though most of the film took place in the cramped passenger quarters of a commercial airliner.  His skill in doing that is every bit as evident today in this vibrant restoration.It's the look of the movie, I think, plus its majestic score, that are largely responsible for the film's past and present popularity.  And it's somehow comforting to know that this prime example how movies evolved to compete with TV in the 50's has now been preserved for all time.  I think it's also true that the High and the Mighty carries with it a not-completely-explicable mystique that few other 50's movies can come close to matching.The fact remains, though, that this is not a very good movie and despite it's enormous success at the box office, serious critics of the day lambasted the film in a way that's very similar to contemporary reviews of the DVD on [..]  In 1954, Bosley Crowther of the N.Y. Times complained about the corniness of the plot and the emptiness and banality of the back-stories of the passengers and crew.  The dialogue in particular, is often achingly bad and it's hard to believe that it was crafted by Ernest K, Gann, a competent writer who did this screen adaptation of his own best seller.  So let's not chalk up all of the film's creakiness to its age; dialogue that sounds shallow and contrived today sounded just as bad in 1954.Some of the performances are decent.  Wayne, as usual, is great and I thought Jan Sterling, David Brian, Claire Trevor, and Paul Kelly were all pretty good.  Even non movie star Phil Harris, though saddled with some of the most grating lines in the film, is fun to watch.  The worst performance, in my opinion, is Robert Newton's, who seems to be completely tuned out to the proceedings and attempts to make his performance interesting by simply failing to make eye contact with the actors who are speaking to him.The extra disk, which contains the ""special features,"" has been praised to the skies (no pun) by many of the reviewers on this site.  Personally, I found almost everything on this disk to be overly brief and disappointing.  The restoration segment, in particular, had little to say and even less to show.  While congratulating themselves for the stunning restoration, the restorers tell us, almost in a whisper, that the color separation negatives were found and used to restore the film.  Separation negatives were black and white ""color masks"" that were rarely made, except on expensive films that were expected to be re-released from time to time.  Getting a gorgeous color print from a separation negative is not quite as big a deal as the restoration team would like us to believe. That's what the separation negatives were for: restoration.  And the availability of these negatives is the main reason why this DVD looks so wonderful.In spite of all my nit picking, however, I'd recommend buying this DVD if you are a Baby Boomer or older and have nostalgic memories of the movie and its era.",3,The Good and the Ugly of The High and the Mighty,1157587200,"09 7, 2006",2006,3126,"['saw', 'movie', 'when', 'was', 'first', 'released', 'was', '12', 'remember', 'being', 'amazed', 'even', 'then', 'how', 'effectively', 'cinematographer', 'utilized', 'ultra-wide', 'screen', 'even', 'most', 'film', 'took', 'place', 'cramped', 'passenger', 'quarters', 'commercial', 'airliner', 'skill', 'doing', 'bit', 'evident', 'today', 'vibrant', 'restoration.It', 'look', 'movie', 'think', 'majestic', 'score', 'are', 'largely', 'responsible', 'film', 'past', 'present', 'popularity', 'somehow', 'comforting', 'know', 'prime', 'example', 'how', 'movies', 'evolved', 'compete', 'TV', '50', 'now', 'been', 'preserved', 'time', 'think', 'also', 'true', 'High', 'Mighty', 'not-completely-explicable', 'mystique', 'few', 'other', '50', 'movies', 'can', 'come', 'close', 'matching.The', 'fact', 'though', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'enormous', 'success', 'box', 'office', 'serious', 'critics', 'day', 'lambasted', 'film', 'way', 'very', 'similar', 'contemporary', 'reviews', 'DVD', '[', '..', ']', '1954', 'Bosley', 'Crowther', 'N.Y.', 'Times', 'complained', 'corniness', 'plot', 'emptiness', 'banality', 'back-stories', 'passengers', 'crew', 'dialogue', 'particular', 'often', 'achingly', 'bad', 'hard', 'believe', 'was', 'crafted', 'Ernest', 'K', 'Gann', 'competent', 'writer', 'who', 'did', 'screen', 'adaptation', 'own', 'best', 'seller', 'So', 'let', 'not', 'chalk', 'film', 'creakiness', 'age', 'dialogue', 'shallow', 'contrived', 'today', 'sounded', 'just', 'bad', '1954.Some', 'performances', 'are', 'decent', 'Wayne', 'usual', 'great', 'thought', 'Jan', 'Sterling', 'David', 'Brian', 'Claire', 'Trevor', 'Paul', 'Kelly', 'were', 'pretty', 'good', 'Even', 'non', 'movie', 'star', 'Phil', 'Harris', 'though', 'saddled', 'most', 'grating', 'lines', 'film', 'fun', 'watch', 'worst', 'performance', 'opinion', 'Robert', 'Newton', 'who', 'be', 'completely', 'tuned', 'out', 'proceedings', 'attempts', 'make', 'performance', 'interesting', 'simply', 'failing', 'make', 'eye', 'contact', 'actors', 'who', 'are', 'speaking', 'him.The', 'extra', 'disk', 'special', 'features', 'been', 'praised', 'skies', 'pun', 'many', 'reviewers', 'site', 'Personally', 'found', 'almost', 'everything', 'disk', 'be', 'overly', 'brief', 'disappointing', 'restoration', 'segment', 'particular', 'had', 'little', 'say', 'even', 'less', 'show', 'congratulating', 'stunning', 'restoration', 'restorers', 'tell', 'almost', 'whisper', 'color', 'separation', 'negatives', 'were', 'found', 'used', 'restore', 'film', 'Separation', 'negatives', 'were', 'black', 'white', 'color', 'masks', 'were', 'rarely', 'made', 'expensive', 'films', 'were', 'expected', 'be', 're-released', 'time', 'time', 'Getting', 'gorgeous', 'color', 'print', 'separation', 'negative', 'not', 'quite', 'big', 'deal', 'restoration', 'team', 'would', 'like', 'believe', 'what', 'separation', 'negatives', 'were', 'restoration', 'availability', 'negatives', 'main', 'reason', 'why', 'DVD', 'so', 'wonderful.In', 'spite', 'nit', 'picking', 'however', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'buying', 'DVD', 'are', 'Baby', 'Boomer', 'older', 'have', 'nostalgic', 'memories', 'movie', 'era']",The High and the Mighty
908290,A4SY5RCGC5CH9,B0009ML2KQ,"Maciej ""Darth Maciek""","[1, 1]","Finally available on DVD after years of legal troubles, this is one of the least known John Wayne's movies and also one of the few, in which he deliberately accepted to play a second role.This film was the very first ""air disaster"" movie, in which a civilian airliner finds itself in deep trouble. Made in 1954, it preceded the much more known ""Zero hour!"" (which was made in 1957) and is generally considered as an inspiration (at least partly) for the later ""Airport"" franchise - and therefore also an ancestor of the already legendary ""Airplane""...The film begins with the boarding of passengers for a flight from Hawaii to California. The plane is a Douglas DC-4, a pretty huge four engines airliner. Passengers are relatively few and the plane will fly half empty - which allows to better know all of them during the dramatic flight. The boarding scene is a pure delight, as it is really an insight into a world long since gone...The main hero of the film is Captain John Sullivan, played very well by Robert Stack. John Wayne plays Dan Roman, the First Officer. Dan Roman is much, much older and much more experienced than Sullivan - but both his career and his personal life were mostly destroyed years ago... Doe Avedon, a gorgeous former model, plays the Flight Attendant, Mrs Spalding - spunky, funny, charming but also very tough she is absolutely excellent in what was only her third role. Soon after this film Doe Avedon married director Don Siegel and abandoned her movie career - which I think was a pity... Passengers are a colorful bunch, with Mr Locota, for whom this is the first flight ever, being my absolute favourite.We have some little warning shots in the beginning of the film and they are pretty well done, even if ultimately not much happens. But just after the plane passed the point of no return, one of the engines catches fire... and then things only get worse...Now, this is a very old film and almost 60 years ago the world was different, the films were different and actors were different - and we must take all of this into account when watching it. Some situations and conversations can seem slightly funny today, especially for anybody who saw ""Airplane"" (by the way, the makers of ""Airplane"" absolutely insisted on having Robert Stack amongst the cast, precisely because of his role in ""The high and the mighty""). But still, this film really preserves a good suspense and much tension until the end. And the final scenes are quite touching, although in a way that probably could not be shown anymore in modern cinema.I ultimately rather liked this film, even if it is not really a masterpiece and it is now slightly aged. I recommend it to all fans of John Wayne or Robert Stack - and also to all those who want to see the great ancestor of ""Airport"" and ""Airplane"" series.

It's the first one with a group of colorful people, trapped together in some calamity, where drama ensues. The movie poster had each actor's photo in a little box running along the bottom.

Some times I got the feeling I was watching ""Airplane"" and forgot that this was all supposed to be serious.The plot itself is actually pretty good. I loved the look at air travel in the 50's. It's a time machine experience. There's a fair amount of suspense built up as well, as they try to make it to San Francisco from Hawaii. The discussion of ditching the plane in the ocean, in such a manner that you feel it was a commonplace option at the time, is often harrowing.The extras are pretty sweet, giving you a great picture of how the film was made, the era in which it was shown, it's historical significance, and what the airline industry was like in it's infancy.It's a great DVD package, but the film itself is kind of a goofy epic.",4,"Entertaining, influential cheeseball epic.",1143590400,"03 29, 2006",2006,1962,"['High', 'Mighty', 'had', 'aura', 'legendary', 'beloved', 'lost', 'epic', 'public', 'eye', 'decades', 'was', 'supposedly', 'great', 'film', '50', 'everyone', 'loved', 'was', 'top', 'money', 'winner', 'year', 'release', 'could', 'no', 'longer', 'see', 'secondary', 'rights', 'issues.It', 'seminal', 'disaster', 'film', 'first', 'one', 'group', 'colorful', 'people', 'trapped', 'together', 'calamity', 'where', 'drama', 'movie', 'poster', 'had', 'actor', 'photo', 'little', 'box', 'running', 'along', 'bottom', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'Airport', 'Towering', 'Inferno', 'Poseidon', 'Adventure', 'leave', 'not', 'think', 'good', 'thing.John', 'Wayne', 'lead', ""n't"", 'have', 'as', 'much', 'screen', 'time', ""'d"", 'imagine', 'cast', 'Robert', 'Stack', 'Claire', 'Trevor', 'bunch', 'character', 'actors', ""'ll"", 'recognize', 'One', 'guy', ""'ll"", 'know', 'voice', 'Baloo.I', 'realize', 'film', '50', 'thought', 'acting', 'was', 'cheesy', 'even', 'era', 'plane', 'filled', 'more', 'hams', 'butcher', 'shop', 'dialogue', 'laughable', 'check', 'Asian', 'character', 'lines', 'dare', 'not', 'wince', 'Robert', 'Stack', 'overly', 'serious', 'voice-overs', 'letting', 'know', 'what', 'thinking', 'made', 'out', 'loud', 'times', 'got', 'feeling', 'was', 'watching', 'Airplane', 'forgot', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'serious.The', 'plot', 'actually', 'pretty', 'good', 'loved', 'look', 'air', 'travel', '50', 'time', 'machine', 'experience', 'fair', 'amount', 'suspense', 'built', 'up', 'as', 'well', 'try', 'make', 'San', 'Francisco', 'Hawaii', 'discussion', 'ditching', 'plane', 'ocean', 'manner', 'feel', 'was', 'commonplace', 'option', 'time', 'often', 'harrowing.The', 'extras', 'are', 'pretty', 'sweet', 'giving', 'great', 'picture', 'how', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'era', 'was', 'shown', 'historical', 'significance', 'what', 'airline', 'industry', 'was', 'infancy.It', 'great', 'DVD', 'package', 'film', 'kind', 'goofy', 'epic']",The High and the Mighty

He plays the pilot whose second fiddle status suggests a darkened incident in his past.  He is jovial and confident enough to accept his place.  However, when the prospect of disaster presents itself, it is he who shows the strength and courage to face the dangers while coolly taking control of the situation.  Much of the film is dawdled away with a soap opera-like examination of the passengers and their ""issues"".  We never seem to endear ourselves to the other passengers but, afterall, we came to see the Duke in action.  This is not his best role but it is as good a role as any to showcase his unique talent.

Wlilliam Wellman's direction is fine, but the cast and Dimitri Tiomkin's score are outstanding.  I always remembered this as the one where John Wayne whistles the haunting theme several times during the film (the special features on the DVD include a revelation about that).The film was unavailable for decades - never released on video (I came across a collector's copy recorded from TV or somewhere for $50 a few years ago, and they wouldn't even guarantee it was complete).  So it's about time they released it on DVD, and they did a fine job, too, the video quality looks great and there are plenty of interesting special features.The plot follows the stories of several passengers and crew aboard a flight from Hawaii to San Francisco when something goes wrong - an engine burns and they calculate they won't make it to land, in any direction.  The suspense mounts as the pilot (Robert Stack, best known as Ellott Ness on The Untouchables) plans to ditch in the ocean, but the co-pilot (John Wayne) wants to try to make it by conserving fuel.  It turns out the navigator (Wally Brown, who I remember from at least one episode of Perry Mason) made an error and it will be too close to call.A number of great actors play the passengers, including Claire Trevor (Stage Coach, Key Largo), Larraine Day, Phil Harris (The Jack Benny Radio Program, Goodbye My Lady, The Jungle Book),  Robert Newton (Long John Silver in Disney's Treasure Island), John Howard, John Qualen (who appeared in many John Wayne films including The Searchers, The Long Voyage Home, The Man Who Shot Liberty Valence),  Ann Doran, Paul Fix (also a regular in John Wayne films including Island In The Sky, but better known as Mica in The Rifleman).  Other familiar faces in the cast include William Campbell (Trelane on the Star Trek episode The Squire Of Gothos, and other episodes) Douglas Fowley, Regis Toomey, Carl 'Alfalfa' Switzer (of The Little Rascals - he also appeared in Island In The Sky), William Hopper (Goodbye My Lady, Perry Mason), William Schallert (Flat Top, The Patty Duke Show) and many others.",5,"Well, it's about time . . . and fuel.",1126915200,"09 17, 2005",2005,2328,"['High', 'Mighty', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'first', 'all-star', 'airline', 'suspense', 'disaster', 'film', 'was', 'probably', 'Five', 'Came', 'Back', '1939', 'certainly', 'neatly', 'one', 'Doomsday', 'Flight', 'one', 'best', 'genre', 'Airport', 'Wlilliam', 'Wellman', 'direction', 'fine', 'cast', 'Dimitri', 'Tiomkin', 'score', 'are', 'outstanding', 'always', 'remembered', 'one', 'where', 'John', 'Wayne', 'haunting', 'theme', 'several', 'times', 'film', 'special', 'features', 'DVD', 'include', 'revelation', '.The', 'film', 'was', 'unavailable', 'decades', 'never', 'released', 'video', 'came', 'collector', 'copy', 'recorded', 'TV', 'somewhere', '50', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'would', ""n't"", 'even', 'guarantee', 'was', 'complete', 'time', 'released', 'DVD', 'did', 'fine', 'job', 'too', 'video', 'quality', 'great', 'are', 'plenty', 'interesting', 'special', 'features.The', 'plot', 'stories', 'several', 'passengers', 'crew', 'aboard', 'flight', 'Hawaii', 'San', 'Francisco', 'when', 'something', 'wrong', 'engine', 'burns', 'calculate', 'wo', ""n't"", 'make', 'land', 'direction', 'suspense', 'mounts', 'pilot', 'Robert', 'Stack', 'best', 'known', 'Ellott', 'Ness', 'Untouchables', 'ditch', 'ocean', 'co-pilot', 'John', 'Wayne', 'try', 'make', 'conserving', 'fuel', 'out', 'navigator', 'Wally', 'Brown', 'who', 'remember', 'least', 'one', 'episode', 'Perry', 'Mason', 'made', 'error', 'will', 'be', 'too', 'close', 'call.A', 'number', 'great', 'actors', 'play', 'passengers', 'including', 'Claire', 'Trevor', 'Stage', 'Coach', 'Key', 'Largo', 'Larraine', 'Day', 'Phil', 'Harris', 'Jack', 'Benny', 'Radio', 'Program', 'Goodbye', 'My', 'Lady', 'Jungle', 'Book', 'Robert', 'Newton', 'Long', 'John', 'Silver', 'Disney', 'Treasure', 'Island', 'John', 'Howard', 'John', 'Qualen', 'who', 'appeared', 'many', 'John', 'Wayne', 'films', 'including', 'Searchers', 'Long', 'Voyage', 'Home', 'Man', 'Who', 'Shot', 'Liberty', 'Valence', 'Ann', 'Doran', 'Paul', 'Fix', 'also', 'regular', 'John', 'Wayne', 'films', 'including', 'Island', 'Sky', 'better', 'known', 'Mica', 'Rifleman', 'Other', 'familiar', 'cast', 'include', 'William', 'Campbell', 'Trelane', 'Star', 'Trek', 'episode', 'Squire', 'Gothos', 'other', 'episodes', 'Douglas', 'Fowley', 'Regis', 'Toomey', 'Carl', ""'Alfalfa"", 'Switzer', 'Little', 'Rascals', 'also', 'appeared', 'Island', 'Sky', 'William', 'Hopper', 'Goodbye', 'My', 'Lady', 'Perry', 'Mason', 'William', 'Schallert', 'Flat', 'Top', 'Patty', 'Duke', 'Show', 'many', 'others']",The High and the Mighty

I'd seen the film years ago on TV and remember enjoying it a lot. I jumped at the chance to get the 2-disc DVD, and I'm not disappointed. The Ultra-Wide Cinemascope transfer is definitely a credit to those people who labor insanely to preserve America's film heritage, especially after the collapse of the studio system. ""The High and the Mighty"" is soap opera with suspense, just like every other disaster film, though it was the first. My interest was held, solidly, and the course of events entertained me. The ensemble cast was uniformly fine, with Oscar nods going to Claire Trevor & Jan Sterling, though I thought Paul Fix was deserving as well. Ralph Dawson's brilliant editing was also nominated. Keeping all this stuff coherent is the sure and confident hand of veteran William A. Wellman, juggling scenes and events that might otherwise come off as silly and incongruous.

908315,A3GLF9XK4AUAHS,B0009ML2KQ,Robert E. Nylund,"[5, 6]","For many years all that remained of ""The High and the Mighty"" was its famous theme tune, composed by Dmitri Timokin and supposedly whistled by John Wayne.  The film itself was unavailable, supposedly literally fading into obscurity due its unstable color process.  Indeed, when the film had last appeared on network television, it was quite obvious that the once-vibrant colors of this magnificent production were almost washed out.  The film was succumbing to the fate of numerous color films and there appeared to be little that could be done to save it.""The High and the Mighty"" was filmed in Warner Color, Warner Brothers' attempt to produce a more economical process to compete with the expensive Technicolor film used in numerous American films.  Unfortunately, this color process did not hold up very well after many years and it was appeared the film would never be seen again.  It might very well have become a ""lost"" masterpiece.When I first saw the film I was quite impressed with everything about it: the very fine, diverse cast; the dramatic story; the memorable musical score; and even the color.  It is wonderful that the film has been fully restored and may even look better than it did when it was first released in 1954.For those of us who are true fans of John Wayne, the release on DVD of ""The High and the Mighty"" has been a welcome addition to our collections of the Duke's films.  When the film was made, Wayne was enjoying a very good, profitable relationship with Jack Warner and the result were a series of mostly memorable films during the 1950s.In many ways this film is a virtual ""time capsule"" of a much different era in which flying, especially over the ocean, was still very much an adventure.  Vintage photos also show that passengers took flying, especially for long distances, quite seriously and treated it as a very formal occasion.  Thus, men wore suits and ties and women wore very fancy dresses.  That can be clearly seen in this film.  One has to marvel that some women could somehow wear the full skirts and petticoats of that time and fit into an airplane seat!Before the advent of commercial jets, flying was much longer and slower.  It took many hours to fly from Honolulu to San Francisco and this film successfully conveys that.  This is NOT a routine flight, however, and the real drama comes when an altercation develops during the flight that affects the fate of everyone on board the plane.  It reaches the point where the viewer wonders if the plane will actually make it to San Francisco.Director William Wellman, sometimes called ""Wild Bill,"" was, from all accounts, a very colorful, imaginative, and even gifted director who had a great love and appreciation for flying.  He was a pilot in World War I and later depicted some of his experiences and impressions of early aerial warfare in the first film to win a Best Picture Oscar, the 1927 Paramount production ""Wings"" with Charles ""Buddy Rogers, Richard Arlen, Clara Bow, Hedda Hopper (who later became a nationally-syndicated gossip columnists), and even a very young Gary Cooper!  Flying was a feature in future Wellman films, including his very last film, the 1958 production ""Lafayette Escadrille.""Wellman clearly had a good relationship with John Wayne; they again worked together a year later in another Warner Brothers film, ""Blood Alley,"" which teamed Wayne with Lauren Bacall.  This film was a Batjac production, the company Wayne cofounded to produce many of his films; it took its name from a fictional company in one of John Wayne's Republic films.The film features a very fine cast, including Claire Trevor, Laraine Day, Robert Stack, Jan Sterling, Robert Newton, Phil Harris, Paul Kelly, John Qualen, Regis Toomey, Paul Fix, and Douglas Fowley.  They all contribute their unique qualities to the unfolding drama that makes this such a memorable film.The DVD set also includes a number of special features that clearly show how the film was made, how it was restored, what it was like to work with both John Wayne and William Wellman, how Batjac was created, and so on.  There are excellent commentaries by Leonard Maltin, who is regularly seen on ""Entertainment Tonight"" and who must be one of the greatest film authorities of all.Amazingly, John Wayne continues to attract new fans through the release on home video of most of his major films, as well as some of his early productions when he struggled to make a name for himself in Hollywood after being virtually neglected by his mentor John Ford.  Fortunately, Ford finally rescued Wayne from grade ""B' Westerns and gave him a featured role in the 1939 film ""Stagecoach,"" establishing Wayne as a major star. (One of Wayne's costars from that historic film, Claire Trevor, has a prominent role in this film.)  There is so much to see among the John Wayne films and this is one of the best of them all.",5,The Return of a Neglected Masterpiece,1151020800,"06 23, 2006",2006,4875,"['many', 'years', 'remained',

The film is a terrific ride from start to finish, with an excellent cast and a magnificent score by Dimitri Tiomkin. Alas, I believe that is the reason why we haven't seen this great film in years.

Some time afterwards, another composer accused Dimitri Tiomkin of plagarising his own work.....I can't remember who this was i'm afraid. The outcome being that Warners had to withdraw the film from circulation until the matter was sorted out. As we've never seen the film since, one can only assume that it's an ongoing situation, although I would imagine that who ever brought the complaint is long gone now (as is Tiomkin).

908324,A5VBAJ0G3UT6O,B0009ML2KQ,THE-GO-BETWEEN,"[532, 544]","Tied up for years in the John Wayne estate has been the re-release of this 1954 movie, &quot;The High and the Mighty&quot;. (which won the Academy Award for Best Song that year...look for a plaque at Mann's Chinese Theatre  in Hollywood when you visit there).As a child growing up in L.A. in the  50's and 60's, I remember the then RKO TV station Channel 9 would show this  movie relentlessly for years on end.  Then it all stopped.  The movie  vanished.  And now it is being held hostage for some legal reason.It  is a movie filled with surplatives though  younger viewers might find the  lack of hyberbolic special effects, sexual gymnastics,  de riguer corporate  disembowlment themes, blah blah....too unsurvivable for a start-to-finish  viewing. It is a vintage 50's type movie...at its best.This is John  Wayne's best movie, in my opinion. He is excellent...taking him out of the  cowboy theme he ultimately became cemented into.  I will always remember  John Wayne in my mind as he was in this movie...especially the very last  scene which alone is worth the price of admission.  Fittingly, the Orange  County Airport is named after John Wayne, who had a career early on of  appearing in films with aviation themes.Ernest K. Gann, who penned the  story, was an American Airlines pilot who churned out aviation novel, one  after another. His equally famous novel that was made into an excellent  movie, was &quot;Fate is the Hunter&quot;. Both of these movies deal with  an aircraft incident/accident.  &quot;The High and the Mighty&quot;  concentrates on the human dynamics of a flight crew and their maintenance  base trying to cope with a mechanical problem en route over the longest  single over-the-ocean route in the world: Honolulu to San Francisco.  It is  as dramatic and technically accurate as you could possibly get.  In fact,  &quot;The High and the Mighty&quot; had all the elements of the recent Jan.  31, 2000 Alaska Airlines crash northwest of Los Angeles.&quot;Fate is  the Hunter&quot; meticulously examines the post accident phase of aircraft  crash investigation.  It is almost like a Hitchock movie in terms of  suspense.  I don't think this movie is available either and that is a shame  since there is so much junk out there that is. Glenn Ford is the star of  this movie.The exciting conclusion of &quot;The High and the  Mighty&quot; stays with you forever...much like the ending of the movie  &quot;The Spirit of St. Louis&quot; which starred James Stewart (also a  great movie and is available).&quot;The High and the Mighty&quot; is a  true aviator's movie...it has the feel and touch of a veteran pilot at the  yoke, Ernest K. Gann.  All of us down on the ground here can only hope and  pray that the powers to be let this great, great American film out of the  hanger and let her fly again....soon.",5,Landmark American Film that must be seen!,955756800,"04 15, 2000",2000,2835,"['Tied', 'up', 'years', 'John', 'Wayne', 'estate', 'been', 're-release', '1954', 'movie', 'quot', 'High', 'Mighty', 'quot', 'won', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Best', 'Song', 'year', 'look', 'plaque', 'Mann', 'Chinese', 'Theatre', 'Hollywood', 'when', 'visit', '.As', 'child', 'growing', 'up', 'L.A.', '50', '60', 'remember', 'then', 'RKO', 'TV', 'station', 'Channel', '9', 'would', 'show', 'movie', 'relentlessly', 'years', 'end', 'Then', 'stopped', 'movie', 'vanished', 'now', 'being', 'held', 'hostage', 'legal', 'reason.It', 'movie', 'filled', 'surplatives', 'younger', 'viewers', 'might', 'find', 'lack', 'hyberbolic', 'special', 'effects', 'sexual', 'gymnastics', 'de', 'riguer', 'corporate', 'disembowlment', 'themes', 'blah', 'blah', 'unsurvivable', 'start-to-finish', 'viewing', 'vintage', '50', 'type', 'movie', 'best.This', 'John', 'Wayne', 'best', 'movie', 'opinion', 'excellent', 'taking', 'cowboy', 'theme', 'ultimately', 'became', 'cemented', 'will', 'always', 'remember', 'John', 'Wayne', 'mind', 'was', 'movie', 'especially', 'very', 'last', 'scene', 'alone', 'price', 'admission', 'Fittingly', 'Orange', 'County', 'Airport', 'named', 'John', 'Wayne', 'who', 'had', 'career', 'early', 'appearing', 'films', 'aviation', 'themes.Ernest', 'K.', 'Gann', 'who', 'penned', 'story', 'was', 'American', 'Airlines', 'pilot', 'who', 'churned', 'out', 'aviation', 'novel', 'one', 'equally', 'famous', 'novel', 'was', 'made', 'excellent', 'movie', 'was', 'quot', 'Fate', 'Hunter', 'quot', 'movies', 'deal', 'aircraft', 'incident/accident', 'quot', 'High', 'Mighty', 'quot', 'concentrates', 'human', 'dynamics', 'flight', 'crew', 'maintenance', 'base', 'trying', 'cope', 'mechanical', 'problem', 'route', 'longest', 'single', 'over-the-ocean', 'route', 'world', 'Honolulu', 'San', 'Francisco', 'dramatic', 'technically', 'accurate', 'could', 'possibly', 'get', 'fact', 'quot', 'High', 'Mighty', 'quot', 'had', 'elements', 'recent', 'Jan.', '31', '2000', 'Alaska', 'Airlines', 'crash', 'northwest', 'Los', 'Angeles.', 'quot', 'Fate', 'Hunter', 'quot', 'meticulously', 'post', 'accident', 'phase', 'aircraft', 'crash', 'investigation', 'almost', 'Hitchock', 'movie', 'terms', 'suspense', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'movie', 'available', 'either', 'shame', 'so', 'much', 'junk', 'there', 'Glenn', 'Ford', 'star', 'movie.The', 'exciting', 'conclusion', 'quot', 'High', 'Mighty', 'quot', 'forever', 'much', 'ending', 'movie', 'quot', 'Spirit', 'St.', 'Louis', 'quot', 'starred', 'James', 'Stewart', 'also', 'great', 'movie', 'available', 'quot', 'High', 'Mighty', 'quot', 'true', 'aviator', 'movie', 'feel', 'touch', 'veteran', 'pilot', 'yoke', 'Ernest', 'K.', 'Gann', 'down', 'ground', 'here', 'can', 'only', 'hope', 'pray', 'powers', 'be', 'let', 'great', 'great', 'American', 'film', 'hanger', 'let', 'fly', 'again', '.soon']",The High and the Mighty

908330,A220FJEQNGMSRN,B0009ML2KQ,Trevor Willsmer,"[1, 1]","They say that absence makes the heart grow fonder, and certainly there's nothing like a film being unavailable for years to help build up its reputation to near-mythical status without having to worry about the film itself shattering the illusion. Case in point The High and The Mighty. The biggest hit of 1954 and one of the first major disaster movies, for a couple of decades or more rights issues and a lengthy restoration process kept the film out of circulation and alive only in the fond memory of those who saw it in their youth. It's not just less impressive than director William Wellman, co-star John Wayne and novelist/screenwriter Ernest K. Gann's previous collaboration Island in the Sky, it's not very good at all. Now that the novelty has gone with six decades of airplane-in-jeopardy movies, much of what's left is clumsily executed hokum with a low-octane cast playing a planeload of annoying and extraordinarily badly written stereotypes facing a swim home when an engine catches fire and their plane loses the extra fuel it needs to make it to dry land. While Leonard Maltin warns in his DVD introduction that it's ""a film very much of it's time,"" even in 1954 this was remarkably unsubtle stuff and it really should be a lot better than it is: money has been spent and there's a lot of talent in the credits, with Wellman and Gann's own aviation experience promising much more than an overlong soap opera in the sky with dialogue and characterisation so risible that even Irwin Allen would have rejected it..Most of the more prominent names in the cast - Claire Trevor's beaten up broad who ""never quite managed to make it legal"" and Robert Newton's Broadway producer and nervous flier who finds himself an unlikely voice of calm in particular - have little to do and not much screen time to do it in. Wayne's veteran co-pilot still traumatised by the crash that killed his wife and child (""The only man I know with the courage not to kill himself"") doesn't have a great deal to do either for most of the film, and it's all too easy to see why first choice Spencer Tracey (among other big stars sought for the passengers) turned the picture down. The presence of a sweating Robert Stack as the pilot at the controls ""whose nerves of steel are starting to rust"" brings up unhelpful memories of Airplane! for modern audiences, with only Doe Avedon (rather misleadingly billed in the trailer as ""a right gal who had to be nice to a lot of wrong people!"") making much of a positive impression as the plane's stewardess. Most of the rest of the cast are so annoying that it's the kind of film where you're rooting for the engine failure. It's hard not to agree with Lenny Bruce, who mercilessly lampooned the film in his 'Non-Skeddo Airlines' routine, that if they really wanted to lighten the plane they should have ditched the irritating 'cute' kid while he was asleep.Very obviously shot almost entirely on the studio lot, the film only briefly kicks into life when Wellman gets to go on location to shoot the various rescue services preparing for the worst, but even these scenes are let down by the distinctly underwhelming big finale. Perhaps the most surprising thing about the film today is the amount of lightweight smut which, though tame today, does push the envelope of what was acceptable within the confines of the all-too easily offended Breen Office's censorship demands of the day - Phil Harris and his wife find themselves the target of a wife-swapping couple at their Hawaiian hotel while nauseating young newlyweds John Smith and Karen Sharpe decide that if they're going to die they may as well go out with a bang.Aside from the grotty looking title sequence, the DVD transfer is quite superb, working wonders on the usually highly variable WarnerColor system and the lack of detail that was such a problem with the early 2.55:1 CinemaScope lenses. There's an excellent extras package too that's worth the price of the disc on its own, including a decent featurette on Dimtri Tiomkin, whose memorable score is one of the best things about the picture and was played at the Duke's funeral.

908331,A31D8QKJXU93BT,B0009ML2KQ,"Vince Perrin ""Byline""","[8, 10]","If ever a Hollywood movie was locked into its period (1954), this is it. ""The High and the Mighty"" is about passengers and crew aboard a plane in peril from Honolulu to San Francisco. It was produced by its star, John Wayne, who surrounded himself with name actors (among them, Claire Trevor, with whom he acted in John Ford's ""Stagecoach,"" his classic breakthrough). It was based on the best-seller by Ernest Gann and directed by William Wellman right after directing Wayne in Gann's ""Island in the Sky."" The movie made a lot of money and earned a half-dozen Oscer nods, winning one for its music by Dimitri Tiomkin.Does it fly today? No. But it is watchable in an oh-no! sort of way. The exposition is clumsy, the dialogue alternates between clich&eacute; and corny, the characters are stereotypes and awkwardly introduced, the music is turbulent when Wayne isn't whistling it (yes!), and the special effects aren't anything special. In fact, its great virtue is the appreciation it gives viewers for the advances Hollywood has made in producing potboilers and in technical competence. There's a reason they don't make movies like this anymore. Still, we couldn't have gotten here from there without first having gone there, and the trip back is sometimes campy fun.Co-pilot Wayne quite literally slaps some sense into pilot Robert Stack, who thanks him for it. Party girl Trevor, taking the red eye in a blue evening gown, flashes a leg garter and flirts with tycoon David Brian; Sidney Blackmer tries to shoot Brian for once flirting with his wife.

This is a legendary movie of the 1950s, long regarded as one of John Wayne's all time greatest films. It presages the 1970s ""Airport"" series with the story of the passengers and crew of an in-flight airliner in significant trouble. Based on the best-selling novel by Ernest K. Gann, it featured a first-rate ensemble cast and a riveting storyline, as well as a theme song that became almost a musical icon of the period. But somewhere along the way this wonderful film got ""kidnapped"" into ""movie limbo"" and has drifted there ever since, mired in all manner of obtuse legalities and , ultimately, a seeming intention on the part of the late Michael Wayne to ""hold it back"" from general release to the public ""until the time is right"". Well the time has long been right and the time is right at this very moment. So BATJAC, or whomever, how about it??? There are people out there now who have NEVER HEARD OF THIS MOVIE and THAT is a crying shame. Let's get ""The High And The Mighty"" out there, people, and get it out there as soon as possible! Or the...Duke...may hafta...come back and...plug ya....pilgrim.Updating this:  finally...FINALLY....""The High And The Mighty"" is due to hit the stores.
