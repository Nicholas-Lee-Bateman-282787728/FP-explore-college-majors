This had a 1st class set & dancers only to be messed up by this incompetent fool !! For anyoneinterested in camera work this is a perfect lesson in what not to do. constant movement does not improve the subject being video. You change angle to see the subject better, you pan to show scope and size of the subject. close ups are for detail of action. at least they were in focus during their marathon run across, up, back, in out of the stage. sad sad work left me seasick and forgot what I was looking at.....oh !! yeah BELLYDANCING not cheesy 1970's porn thank god they left out desolves...",1,Kill the camera operator,1340928000,"06 29, 2012",2012,664,"['hope', 'dancers', 'got', 'line', 'up', 'bitch', 'slap', 'camera', 'operator', 'had', '1st', 'class', 'set', 'dancers', 'only', 'be', 'messed', 'up', 'incompetent', 'fool', 'anyoneinterested', 'camera', 'work', 'perfect', 'lesson', 'what', 'not', 'do', 'constant', 'movement', 'not', 'improve', 'subject', 'being', 'video', 'change', 'angle', 'see', 'subject', 'better', 'pan', 'show', 'scope', 'size', 'subject', 'close', 'ups', 'are', 'detail', 'action', 'least', 'were', 'focus', 'marathon', 'run', 'across', 'up', 'back', 'stage', 'sad', 'sad', 'work', 'left', 'seasick', 'forgot', 'what', 'was', 'looking', '..oh', 'yeah', 'BELLYDANCING', 'not', 'cheesy', '1970', 'porn', 'thank', 'god', 'left', 'out', 'desolves']",Bellydance Performance Ensemble with Suhaila
880829,A7U9GG09POJ02,B0007GP7UK,Erin,"[1, 1]","I agree with the good and bad that has been written abou this dvd so far:GREAT professional non-annoying, almost instinctual camera work.Lighting is at times dark, but not by accident, but for mood, obviously. Dancers do have shadows falling across their bodies but it creates the atmosphere of a club setting and intimacy to me, personally. I don`t mind a shadow here and there. Very sexy. More like theatre than like an aerobic video lighting.The diversity is questionable. And the music does get slightly redundent tho the songs do change.But if you`re a dance lover, you will like this dvd. I do like mine very much. I like it to watch to get ideas for my own dancing. Very cozy. Would be great on a big screen plasma during an eastern-themed cocktail party.. its like that. Very atmospheric.All in all more than I hoped for. Does have a lot of what I would term modern influence in dance as well as the music at times, tho I would catagorize it absolutely as bellydance and so would the average layperson.If you are a purist and sensual edge annoys you.. pass this one by. But if you love a little mystery at the price of absolute athenticity.. this dvd is for you.",5,Pros and Cons . . .,1223337600,"10 7, 2008",2008,1170,"['agree', 'good', 'bad', 'been', 'written', 'abou', 'dvd', 'so', 'far', 'GREAT', 'professional', 'non-annoying', 'almost', 'instinctual', 'camera', 'work.Lighting', 'times', 'dark', 'not', 'accident', 'mood', 'obviously', 'Dancers', 'do', 'have', 'shadows', 'falling', 'bodies', 'atmosphere', 'club', 'setting', 'intimacy', 'personally', 'don', 't', 'mind', 'shadow', 'here', 'there', 'Very', 'sexy', 'More', 'theatre', 'aerobic', 'video', 'lighting.The', 'diversity', 'questionable', 'music', 'get', 'slightly', 'redundent', 'songs', 'do', 'change.But', 're', 'dance', 'lover', 'will', 'like', 'dvd', 'do', 'mine', 'very', 'much', 'like', 'watch', 'get', 'ideas', 'own', 'dancing', 'Very', 'cozy', 'Would', 'be', 'great', 'big', 'screen', 'plasma', 'eastern-themed', 'cocktail', 'party..', 'Very', 'atmospheric.All', 'more', 'hoped', 'Does', 'have', 'lot', 'what', 'would', 'term', 'modern', 'influence', 'dance', 'as', 'well', 'music', 'times', 'tho', 'would', 'catagorize', 'absolutely', 'bellydance', 'so', 'would', 'average', 'layperson.If', 'are', 'purist', 'sensual', 'edge', 'you..', 'pass', 'one', 'love', 'little', 'mystery', 'price', 'absolute', 'athenticity..', 'dvd']",Bellydance Performance Ensemble with Suhaila

Bellydance is an art form that in my opinion should not be mixed or played with.  I dont like it when the dance form is distorted by fusion.  So if you like the original bellydance moves, and real middle easter dance, this is not for you.  But if you like to play around with this dance, its ok.  For the price of $4 its ok.",2,"So..so, kinda generic",1214524800,"06 27, 2008",2008,420,"['like', 'fusion', 'bellydance', 'own', 'style', 'mixed', 'not', 'bellydance', 'ok.', 'Bellydance', 'art', 'form', 'opinion', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'mixed', 'played', 'dont', 'when', 'dance', 'form', 'distorted', 'fusion', 'So', 'like', 'original', 'bellydance', 'moves', 'real', 'middle', 'easter', 'dance', 'not', 'like', 'play', 'around', 'dance', 'ok.', 'price', '4', 'ok']",Bellydance Performance Ensemble with Suhaila
880831,A2U0W6B8IVRVXI,B0007GP7UK,Laura J. Johnson,"[18, 35]","This DVD is entertaining and slick but lacked variety in a number of areas. What personally bothered me the most were the dancers.  They all appeared to be the same size, shape, age, and race. Even the costumes lacked color. Suhaila, herself, seemed to be a little stiff and lacked soul in comparison to other performers in the belly dance DVD's I own.I enjoy watching the belly dance troops LOTUS FIRE and CARAVAN OF DREAMS in my town Bozeman, Montana more than this DVD. The dancers in my area are different ages (some over 45), looks, and especially body shape--women who have had babies and are in my eyes fertility goddesses. This is much closer to the origins of the dances done for special ceremonies where woman of nearly all ages participated. The local troops also wear different colored costumes as they perform together--which is much more visually entertaining.To me belly dancing should be art and ritual for everyone--filled with the spirit and diversity of all womanhood. Instead, I felt like I was watching an old Robert Palmer music video with his look-a-like Barbie dolls dancing behind him.",4,Entertaining but Lacks Diversity,1134259200,"12 11, 2005",2005,1110,"['DVD', 'entertaining', 'slick', 'lacked', 'variety', 'number', 'areas', 'What', 'personally', 'bothered', 'most', 'were', 'dancers', 'appeared', 'be', 'same', 'size', 'shape', 'age', 'race', 'Even', 'costumes', 'lacked', 'color', 'Suhaila', 'seemed', 'be', 'little', 'stiff', 'lacked', 'soul', 'comparison', 'other', 'performers', 'belly', 'dance', 'DVD', 'own.I', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'belly', 'dance', 'troops', 'LOTUS', 'FIRE', 'CARAVAN', 'OF', 'DREAMS', 'town', 'Bozeman', 'Montana', 'more', 'DVD', 'dancers', 'area', 'are', 'different', 'ages', '45', 'especially', 'body', 'shape', 'women', 'who', 'have', 'had', 'babies', 'are', 'eyes', 'fertility', 'goddesses', 'much', 'closer', 'origins', 'dances', 'done', 'special', 'ceremonies', 'where', 'woman', 'nearly', 'ages', 'participated', 'local', 'troops', 'also', 'wear', 'different', 'colored', 'costumes', 'perform', 'together', 'much', 'more', 'visually', 'entertaining.To', 'belly', 'dancing', 'should', 'be', 'art', 'ritual', 'everyone', 'filled', 'spirit', 'diversity', 'womanhood', 'Instead', 'felt', 'was', 'watching', 'old', 'Robert', 'Palmer', 'music', 'video', 'look-a-like', 'Barbie', 'dancing']",Bellydance Performance Ensemble with Suhaila

Some of it I like, some I don't, but never boring to watch.The one thing I did not like about this DVD was the lighting, during group numbers there was some partial lighting, and when the dancers were in the shadows you could barely see what they were doing!  The solos were much better lit and I loved the little girl's solo.  The dance setting was very professional and interesting, too bad I couldn't see all of the dancing because of the shadows.",3,"Great dancing, but not very well lit !",1131062400,"11 4, 2005",2005,512,"['Suhaila', 'dancing', 'very', 'different', 'always', 'interesting', 'like', 'do', ""n't"", 'never', 'boring', 'watch.The', 'one', 'thing', 'did', 'not', 'like', 'DVD', 'was', 'lighting', 'group', 'numbers', 'was', 'partial', 'lighting', 'when', 'dancers', 'were', 'shadows', 'could', 'barely', 'see', 'what', 'were', 'doing', 'solos', 'were', 'much', 'better', 'lit', 'loved', 'little', 'girl', 'solo', 'dance', 'setting', 'was', 'very', 'professional', 'interesting', 'too', 'bad', 'could', ""n't"", 'see', 'dancing', 'shadows']",Bellydance Performance Ensemble with Suhaila
