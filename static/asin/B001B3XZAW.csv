A bevy of the same talking heads from the other films make some of the same points as they do elsewhere, but this film stitches together a solid narrative and trail of evidence for even the most apathetic viewer to easily follow. There are some claims made, by some of the wackier denizens of this documentary, and the others, such as simply eating this or that being a cure for cancer, or curing clinical depression simply by subscribing a high niacin diet, but none of this has ever been tested in controlled studies.That stated, the film is correct in calling out the FDA, the Department of Agriculture, and the EPA for their failures to regulate the production and marketing of the assorted advertising gimmicks used to foist bad foods upon the public, as well as labeling the whole system the `sickness industry,' rather than the wellness or food industry, as well as showing how perverse it is for the drug companies (which often own the agriculture companies) to control the medical journals and university grants that research and detail the harm caused by their own policies.Technically, Food Matters is a cut or two above Fed Up! on the cinematic scale, and also penetrates a bit more deeply into the issues that first film raises.

In truth, cooking some foods makes vitamins/nutrients more readily available to humans, like vitamin A in cooked carrots.  And the body treats ALL food as foreign -- that's what digestion is all about!Andrew Saul claims that ""For every drug there is a nutrient that will do the same job.""  Yes, even HIV/AIDS can be cured with brazil nuts alone according to ""orthomolecular medicine.""Note that no ordinary juicer will suffice.

Nor are the credentials of these ""experts"" impressive.  Andrew W. Saul, for example, claims to have a ""Ph.D."" -- from Greenwich University, which has been called by journalists a ""diploma mill.""

Their current brochure also claims they still use injectable crude calves liver.

1170404,ANA2PVMARGY8H,B001B3XZAW,"Sarah ""Bookworm/cat person""","[28, 31]","I've watched this movie more than a few times on Netflix, and it rates as one of my favorite documentaries, along with ""Forks Over Knives"" (anything that encourages veganism is great in my book). We are admonished to be our own doctors and nutritionists to educate ourselves, as our conventionally trained medical doctors are often clueless about the importance of nutrition in the prevention and reversal of disease. As intelligent and well-educated as most doctors are, there is a real gap in many doctors' awareness of the pivotal role of nutrition. For example, this one time I was with my mom in the emergency room because she was experiencing tachycardia, and I was talking with the friendly, youngish emergency room doctor about the importance of my mom overhauling her diet. I thought that the younger generations of doctors would be better informed about nutrition. I said that my mom's arthritis would get better is she got rid of the added sugar, as added sugar causes inflammation. Instead of agreeing with me, the doctor said, ""Sugar is okay in moderation."" NO!!! She had just unwittingly undone months of my attempt to get my mother to clean up her diet, as the doctor seemed to have more authority than me, as I am not a medical doctor (nor do I play one on TV, to quote Morgan Spurlock's Don't Eat This Book). My dad's primary care doctor is a wonderful, humble man filled with integrity, yet dangerously overweight himself. This is not an aesthetic reproach, as it is never okay to mock someone over his or her appearance, but a health concern. If he went whole foods vegan with a large proportion of raw foods, I doubt he would be a pound overweight, unless he has very rare metabolic issues that will trump even the best of eating plans. If you eat a lot of animal-based products and refined foods on the Standard American Diet, you are going to be at high risk for a host of lifestyle diseases.One of my favorite quotes from this movie is so spot-on: ""You can be sincere, and you can be sincerely wrong."" This describes the mindset of ""there's a pill for every ill."" Bill Maher had it right when he said, ""The answer isn't another pill. The answer is spinach."" We do need conventional medicine. I could take all of the probiotics in the world, but it may not be as strong as the antibiotic that I need to get rid of an infection. If you are in an automobile accident, megadoses of vitamins aren't the answer then and there---surgery is. Yet for preventable lifestyle diseases, good nutrition IS the answer, not drugs that are highly toxic to our livers and that have accompanying side effects that are almost bad as the diseases being treated. We wouldn't even need more than half of the procedures and drug therapies we've come to normalize if we'd all overhaul our collective Standard American Diets and replace that noxious fare with organic fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, and whole grains, with ideally 80% of those foods in its raw, uncooked state. Believe me, this food isn't bland or limited. It's delicious and only limited by your preparation skills and imagination.I've posted more than a few times on Facebook about the two handfuls of cashews story featured in this documentary. Apparently, two handfuls of cashews are as effective as a standard dose of Prozac in treating depression. High doses of Niacin (coupled with Vitamin C) can treat recalcitrant depression, bipolar mood disorder, and schizophrenia, giving these poor victims a life again. (When someone is experiencing a chemical imbalance, regardless of the origin of the chemical imbalance, it's believed that the neurotransmitters are rerouted, so that the normal pathways are unavailable and unfamiliar synaptic connections are made, which has the net effect of causing increasing confusion and delirium. Depression involves issues with serotonin, the ""feel-good"" neurotransmitter--either a lack of serotonin itself or serotonin receptor sites. Tryptophan is a serotonin precursor and is abundant is cashews. It's not exactly understood how Niacin does its magic, but it's theorized that Niacin helps keep adrenalin and noradrenalin in check, which can cause a host of problems when they're off kilter, plus Niacin helps regulate serotonin.) I would warn people to learn from my mistake and to not take themselves off any psychiatric medication cold turkey, as that can have devastating results. I took myself off of Zyprexa, which I did not tolerate very well, and am still haunted to this day by that miserable, humiliating experience---my behavior was so off and offensive at that point in time, and people who don't understand what it's like firsthand to have a chemical imbalance make the mistake of taking everything at face value, and/or aren't yet ready to put the off behavior into a far more compassionate context. When I was on Zyprexa, I gained 30 pounds (I had always been pencil thin and had even been falsely accused of being anorexic before the Zyprexa weight gain) in about a two-weeks time frame. That isn't normal. That medication was highly toxic to my body, and I never should have been on it in the first place (I just wanted to sleep all of the time when I was on it and was a bit slower at processing information). Yet when pharmacy reps wined and dined my then psychiatrist, she herself may have not been fully aware of the potential side effects or how poorly tolerated this particular medication is. One of my friends was taken off this medication piecemeal under psychiatric supervision and still had a psychotic episode---that's how dangerous Zyprexa is. If he and I had known that high doses of Niacin and cashews (!!!) would work far better and were far safer, of course he and I would have opted for the natural remedies. We just didn't know, nor did our conventionally trained doctors.I really like David Wolfe, and he's one of the reasons I decided to go mostly raw, as he always has so much energy and seems to be a very positive person. He is featured in this documentary and says many things that make so much sense. He advises us to eat at least more than half raw at every meal, and then we can get the benefits of raw foods, even if we aren't yet at 75%, 80%, or 100% raw. It's actually not too difficult to do 75%. Eat one cooked meal a day, say dinner, and the rest of what you eat throughout the day can be raw. Even at dinner, have a raw salad or fresh fruit before your meal, so you can still get the benefits of raw foods even at your cooked meal.This documentary can be a life-changer and a life-saver. I highly recommend it. ""The easiest solution is the right one."" That is, nutrition can be transformative and is much easier than costly procedures and putting your health and well-being in the hands of Big Pharma.",5,Empowering information,1337385600,"05 19,
