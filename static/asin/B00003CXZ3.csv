541589,AYQY3RB33F4J6,B00003CXZ3,3rdeadly3rd,"[9, 10]","A film that runs backwards...a film noir that runs backwards...a film in which everyone's up to something but it's almost impossible to work out what. Maybe not everyone's cup of tea in terms of premise of film, but &quot;Memento&quot; is far and away the most inventive crime/thriller film of recent years.The plot revolves around Leonard (&quot;don't call me Lenny&quot;) Shelby and his attempts at finding his wife's killer. To make life slightly harder, the attack which killed his wife also robbed Shelby of his ability to make new memories - thus, he writes copious notes everywhere and records clues in his hunt by tattooing them on himself or taking polaroid photos of them.Naturally, the standout feature of this film is the reverse-telling. The opening moments actually run backwards as a bullet explodes back into a gun, but the rest of the film is divided into sections of between 5 and 10 minutes which are simply re-ordered to go backwards. On the first viewing this is quite disorienting, but eventually the mind catches up with what's going on and the viewer will say things to himself such as &quot;so this scene needs to get Leonard to the hotel room&quot; to keep up with the narrative.There are also a series of black-and-white scenes which appear in between the backwards scenes and it is the constant puzzle over where these fit in and exactly what is going on which keeps the viewer engaged. In short, this is not a movie to sit back and relax in unless you want to be left behind very rapidly.The two male leads receive the bulk of the screen time, with Australia's Guy Pearce handling Leonard Shelby in a particularly strong manner. Pearce's only major Hollywood role prior to this one had been opposite Russell Crowe in &quot;LA Confidential&quot;, and it had been a mystery among Australian film buffs why Crowe had gone on to bigger and better things while Pearce had not. This performance certainly reaffirms his position as one of the better actors of today.Joe Pantoliano (of &quot;Matrix&quot; fame) is also superb as the shady Teddy, a man who clearly knows much more than he is letting on. Pantoliano is charming enough in the early scenes to set himself up as the good guy, but (and this is far from revealing the plot) is also capable of presenting a very dark side to his character.Shelby, who often tells the story in an internal monologue (a definite nod to the noir classics), is a mordantly funny character. One of the great moments of the film - spread over nearly half an hour of cuts - involves his fight with a man named Dodd. At one point, we see the two men running parallel to each other through a trailer park; as the scene begins, Shelby's voice asks &quot;what am I doing? That's right, I'm running. Am I chasing someone?&quot; Having seen Dodd, he comments &quot;That's right, I'm chasing him.&quot; Dodd shoots at him as Shelby calmly corrects himself &quot;Nope, he's chasing me&quot;. Later, Shelby is sitting in a bathroom with a bottle in his hand waiting to attack the owner of the hotel room; one scene features him looking down at the bottle and thinking &quot;strange, I don't feel drunk...&quot;Realistically, there is no way in which viewing this film could be done in a passive way. The viewer is constantly asking questions about where certain objects are, why some writing is obscured, what role various characters (especially Shelby's possible love interest) have in the plot and so on. The story of Sammy Jenkis, slowly revealed in the black-and-white scenes, only adds to these layers which need to be waded through.A film like this has to be seen on many occasions and preferably with a group of people, as each one will notice different details and clues about what might actually have been going on. As the credits roll at the end (or beginning, depending on how you wish to think about it), there will generally be more questions than there are answers - that, after all, is the mark of success of a film noir. Is Leonard successful? In the end, that is really up the viewer to decide.This film has no drawbacks at all, and should be viewed by anyone interested in challenging their perceptions of the world. It is also a particularly effective lesson in telling a story in an unconventional manner.If you enjoy cheering for the good guy or the bad guy, this film is probably not for you. If you enjoy trying to work out who the good guy or the bad guy is so you can cheer for him, this is definitely for you.",5,Compulsive and Compulsory Viewing,1033344000,"09 30, 2002",2002,4482,"['film', 'backwards', 'film', 'noir', 'backwards', 'film', 'everyone', 'up', 'something', 'almost', 'impossible', 'work', 'out', 'what', 'Maybe', 'not', 'everyone', 'cup', 'tea', 'terms', 'premise', 'film', 'quot', 'Memento', 'quot', 'far', 'away', 'most', 'inventive', 'crime/thriller', 'film', 'recent', 'years.The', 'plot', 'around', 'Leonard', 'quot', 'do', ""n't"", 'call', 'Lenny', 'quot', 'Shelby', 'attempts', 'finding', 'wife', 'killer', 'make', 'life', 'slightly', 'harder', 'attack', 'killed', 'wife', 'also', 'robbed', 'Shelby', 'ability', 'make', 'new', 'memories', 'thus', 'copious', 'notes', 'everywhere', 'records', 'clues', 'hunt', 'tattooing', 'taking', 'polaroid', 'photos', 'them.Naturally', 'standout', 'feature', 'film', 'reverse-telling', 'opening', 'moments', 'actually', 'run', 'backwards', 'bullet', 'back', 'gun', 'rest', 'film', 'divided', 'sections', '5', '10', 'minutes', 'are', 'simply', 're-ordered', 'go', 'backwards', 'first', 'viewing', 'quite', 'disorienting', 'eventually', 'mind', 'up', 'what', 'going', 'viewer', 'will', 'say', 'things', 'such', 'quot', 'so', 'scene', 'get', 'Leonard', 'hotel', 'room', 'quot', 'keep', 'up', 'narrative.There', 'are', 'also', 'series', 'black-and-white', 'scenes', 'appear', 'backwards', 'scenes', 'constant', 'puzzle', 'where', 'fit', 'exactly', 'what', 'going', 'viewer', 'engaged', 'short', 'not', 'movie', 'sit', 'back', 'relax', 'want', 'be', 'left', 'behind', 'very', 'rapidly.The', 'two', 'male', 'leads', 'receive', 'bulk', 'screen', 'time', 'Australia', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'handling', 'Leonard', 'Shelby', 'particularly', 'strong', 'manner', 'Pearce', 'only', 'major', 'Hollywood', 'role', 'prior', 'one', 'had', 'been', 'opposite', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'quot', 'LA', 'Confidential', 'quot', 'had', 'been', 'mystery', 'Australian', 'film', 'buffs', 'why', 'Crowe', 'had', 'gone', 'bigger', 'better', 'things', 'Pearce', 'had', 'not', 'performance', 'certainly', 'position', 'one', 'better', 'actors', 'today.Joe', 'Pantoliano', 'quot', 'Matrix', 'quot', 'fame', 'also', 'superb', 'shady', 'Teddy', 'man', 'who', 'clearly', 'much', 'more', 'letting', 'Pantoliano', 'charming', 'enough', 'early', 'scenes', 'set', 'up', 'good', 'guy', 'far', 'revealing', 'plot', 'also', 'capable', 'presenting', 'very', 'dark', 'side', 'character.Shelby', 'who', 'often', 'story', 'internal', 'monologue', 'definite', 'nod', 'noir', 'classics', 'mordantly', 'funny', 'character', 'One', 'great', 'moments', 'film', 'spread', 'nearly', 'hour', 'cuts', 'fight', 'man', 'named', 'Dodd', 'one', 'point', 'see', 'two', 'men', 'running', 'parallel', 'other', 'trailer', 'park', 'scene', 'Shelby', 'voice', 'quot', 'what', 'am', 'doing', 'right', ""'m"", 'running', 'Am', 'chasing', 'someone', 'quot', 'Having', 'seen', 'Dodd', 'comments', 'quot', 'right', ""'m"", 'chasing', 'him.', 'quot', 'Dodd', 'shoots', 'Shelby', 'calmly', 'quot', 'Nope', 'chasing', 'quot', 'Later', 'Shelby', 'sitting', 'bathroom', 'bottle', 'hand', 'waiting', 'attack', 'owner', 'hotel', 'room', 'one', 'scene', 'looking', 'down', 'bottle', 'thinking', 'quot', 'strange', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'drunk', 'quot', 'Realistically', 'way', 'viewing', 'film', 'could', 'be', 'done', 'passive', 'way', 'viewer', 'constantly', 'asking', 'questions', 'where', 'certain', 'objects', 'are', 'why', 'writing', 'obscured', 'what', 'role', 'various', 'characters', 'especially', 'Shelby', 'possible', 'love', 'interest', 'have', 'plot', 'so', 'story', 'Sammy', 'Jenkis', 'slowly', 'revealed', 'black-and-white', 'scenes', 'only', 'layers', 'need', 'be', 'waded', 'through.A', 'film', 'be', 'seen', 'many', 'occasions', 'preferably', 'group', 'people', 'one', 'will', 'notice', 'different', 'details', 'clues', 'what', 'might', 'actually', 'have', 'been', 'going', 'credits', 'roll', 'end', 'beginning', 'depending', 'how', 'wish', 'think', 'will', 'generally', 'be', 'more', 'questions', 'are', 'answers', 'mark', 'success', 'film', 'noir', 'Leonard', 'successful', 'end', 'really', 'up', 'viewer', 'decide.This', 'film', 'drawbacks', 'should', 'be', 'viewed', 'anyone', 'interested', 'challenging', 'perceptions', 'world', 'also', 'particularly', 'effective', 'lesson', 'telling', 'story', 'unconventional', 'manner.If', 'enjoy', 'cheering', 'good', 'guy', 'bad', 'guy', 'film', 'probably', 'not', 'enjoy', 'trying', 'work', 'out', 'who', 'good', 'guy', 'bad', 'guy', 'so', 'can', 'cheer', 'definitely']",Memento VHS

It just wasn't believable--no, I don't mean a reality-based believable, I mean that the character would not have done what he did at the end.  After sitting through this film and getting to care about this guy (even though he was a shmuck), they go and pull that on me.  Yeah, human nature is suprising, but really this was less of a suprise and more of a predicatable hollywood ending. It ruined the whole feel of a very well paced and intriguing movie.  I would have given it 5 stars for it's unique qualities and ability to draw you in, but the ending was anything but unique.  It was intentionally made to please the viewer with a pose of the unique, but it was almost a cliche.  Trying to be somewhat like Seven.  But Seven had already been made, and Pitt's character in that film did what he probably would have done.  For someone with this guy's curiosity, he would not have taken the action that he did.  Why be so into finding out about what happened that you tattoo yourself over every inch of your skin, then go and blow it all with a simple act of unfounded vengeance.  Sure veangeance is a strong emotion, but this guy isn't lazy, he's not tired of the hunt (he can't be, he forgets how tired he is every day), but for some reason he just gives up at the end.  I don't accept that.

The acting is magnificent with the exception of Joe Pantolino who plays the greasy mugging role as usual.  The direction is great and Guy Pearce really captures the character without playing over the top at all.  Lovely and understated.  The problems I do find with the film are the black and white sequences which although very captivating, are not clarified for the viewer distinctly in terms of when in time they happen.  Another problem I have is the resolution for us...so, did he do her with the needle or did he commit the heinous acts he thought he saw John G commit???  This is totally unclear because the Teddy character suggests both that his wife had diabetes...but he also said that Shelby had killed the real John G and gave proof with the photos.  Is this some huge glitch the director didn't bother working out because he felt the audience would just think...&quot;oooooh...he did imagined it&quot; and just forget the details?  I don't like working for a film attention-wise and getting peanuts in return.As for how could he remember his condition...something several people keep asking...Um...did you notice that &quot;Remember Sammy Jankis&quot; tattoo on his hand?

But what elevates this film above every other thriller of the past ten or so years is that if you blink, laugh or linger too much on a pivotal scene the whole flick becomes a mosh pit of violence, tragedy and brilliant acting that still ties together at the end but not as tight a knot as it would be as if the viewer would have paid attention. So long story short you will have to watch this dvd at least 3 or 4 times just for a complete picture. The story paints the amazing Guy Pearce as Leonard a modern day Trojan Horse who is used by all the bad guys around him to do their own dirty dealings but Leonard has problems of his own he has a dead wife and short term memory loss. Leonard body is covered in tattoos and pockets full of poloraids of the people he interacts with so he could have some form of continuinity in his life. I won't play spoiler here but the plot is simple but the pace is not. You have to catch the opening to get the endng and the flashbacks don't really excell the story instead they are in place to make the viewer draw their own conclusion as to Leonard's life. Because for all the Trojan Horsing he has been doing some key factor remains Leonard's wife is dead, nobody including Leonard can be trusted, the hand is not quicker than the eye and Memento has to be on eof the most daunting and rewarding films in the history of cinema!",5,Confusing?

Memento ends as it begins, and the ending you see, before the credits roll, is chronologically the middle point of the story you watch unfold before you on screen. Confused? Well it is being shown to you in 5-10min. segments, progressing...or digressing I should say, from the end to the beginning. You are completely wrapped up in the life of Leonard Shelby, a man that suffers from short-term memory loss, and lives his life by following the photos and messages he has made for himself.The script is based on a short story by Johnatan Nolan. Christopher Nolan, his brother, wrote the script and directed the film, this being his second feature. It is difficult for me to go on about the plot, because it truly is an experience to walk in there not knowing anything. This was not the case for me. I read a few reviews, many better than the one you are reading now. I knew what to expect about the backwards storytelling, as well as a few key points about the main characters, but nothing that was really crucial. There is really nothing that can prepare you for this film.If you liked movies like Se7en, and Usual Suspects, than I definitely recommend the film. The similarities Memento has to those films are mostly in the overall tone, and that it is without a doubt a part of the Detective/Crime thriller genre. Leonard Shelby (played by Guy Pearce to a ""T"", he is Leonard Shelby!!), becomes the ultimate hard-boiled detective. He's got drive, that being to find the man that murdered his wife, and he's got his short term memory loss which makes his task go from difficult to near impossible. But, unlike those other films, Memento shocks you at the beginning of every segment, where you are once again left to figure out where you are and whats going on, to the point where you may eventually lose track. By the time you reach the climax ending, you will probably be frustrated having tried so hard to outsmart the film. Memento succeeds on many levels. It is among the greatest noir films ever made. It's got guns, cars, black humor, red herrings, and a femme fatale. It outshines Psycho in engaging the audience on a subliminal basis. Indeed, as a thriller, it ranks with Hitchcock's best. Best of all, it poses a number of profound BIG questions concerning the nature of man, his morality, and the basis for his civilizations and religions in such a subtle way that it almost seems an afterthought. Yes, this movie will really make you think. And it will make you want to talk to others about it. For people who love to see movies with excellent scripts, psychologic effects and complicated plots, this movie shouldn't be missed.",5,RENT...BUY...JUST MAKE SURE YOU SEE THIS MOVIE,1184284800,"07 13, 2007",2007,2732,"[""'ll"", 'either', 'love', 'hate', 'Memento', 'just', 'saw', 'Memento', 'have', 'say', 'great', 'film', 'Memento', 'ending', 'see', 'credits', 'roll', 'chronologically', 'middle', 'point', 'story', 'watch', 'unfold', 'screen', 'Confused', 'Well', 'being', 'shown', '5-10min', 'segments', 'progressing', 'digressing', 'should', 'say', 'end', 'beginning', 'are', 'completely', 'wrapped', 'up', 'life', 'Leonard', 'Shelby', 'man', 'short-term', 'memory', 'loss', 'life', 'following', 'photos', 'messages', 'made', 'himself.The', 'script', 'based', 'short', 'story', 'Johnatan', 'Nolan', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'brother', 'wrote', 'script', 'directed', 'film', 'being', 'second', 'feature', 'difficult', 'go', 'plot', 'truly', 'experience', 'walk', 'there', 'not', 'knowing', 'anything', 'was', 'not', 'case', 'read', 'few', 'reviews', 'many', 'better', 'one', 'are', 'reading', 'now', 'knew', 'what', 'expect', 'backwards', 'storytelling', 'as', 'well', 'few', 'key', 'points', 'main', 'characters', 'nothing', 'was', 'really', 'crucial', 'really', 'nothing', 'can', 'prepare', 'film.If', 'liked', 'movies', 'Se7en', 'Usual', 'Suspects', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'film', 'similarities', 'Memento', 'films', 'are', 'mostly', 'overall', 'tone', 'doubt', 'part', 'Detective/Crime', 'thriller', 'genre', 'Leonard', 'Shelby', 'played', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'T', 'Leonard', 'Shelby', 'ultimate', 'hard-boiled', 'detective', 'got', 'drive', 'being', 'find', 'man', 'murdered', 'wife', 'got', 'short', 'term', 'memory', 'loss', 'task', 'go', 'difficult', 'impossible', 'other', 'films', 'Memento', 'beginning', 'segment', 'where', 'are', 'once', 'again', 'left', 'figure', 'out', 'where', 'are', 'whats', 'going', 'point', 'where', 'may', 'eventually', 'lose', 'track', 'time', 'reach', 'climax', 'ending', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'frustrated', 'having', 'tried', 'so', 'hard', 'outsmart', 'film', 'Memento', 'many', 'levels', 'greatest', 'noir', 'films', 'ever', 'made', 'got', 'guns', 'cars', 'black', 'humor', 'red', 'herrings', 'femme', 'fatale', 'Psycho', 'engaging', 'audience', 'subliminal', 'basis', 'Indeed', 'thriller', 'Hitchcock', 'best', 'Best', 'number', 'profound', 'BIG', 'questions', 'concerning', 'nature', 'man', 'morality', 'basis', 'civilizations', 'religions', 'such', 'subtle', 'way', 'almost', 'afterthought', 'Yes', 'movie', 'will', 'really', 'make', 'think', 'will', 'make', 'want', 'talk', 'others', 'people', 'who', 'love', 'see', 'movies', 'excellent', 'scripts', 'psychologic', 'effects', 'complicated', 'plots', 'movie', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'missed']",Memento VHS

Chris Nolan took a good idea (a man who can't remember attempting to avenge his wife's murder), threw in a gimmick (a slick backward presentation), and created a masterwork. The opening, where a Polaroid undevelops, is a classy lead-in to the style. But that's just the start.The backwards style is more then a gimmick. The plot is mostly told by ending the scene at the beginning of the prior scene; this is intercut with black and white footage that serves mainly for plot exposition; watch carefully the second time, and you'll see Nolan's geniusGuy Pearce's performance as Lenny, while not the key to the film, is effective. We can feel Lenny's confusion as time and time again he wonders, ""What just happened?"" Carrie-Anne Moss and Joe Pantoliano are equally effective; we are never quite sure why they're doing what they do, any more then Lenny is.The ending... err, the middle... is one of the strongest and most confusing events in the film. Every thing you witnessed since the first shot of the movie is seen in a new light, questions are answered, and new ones are posed; that this is true in all good Noir does not in any way stifle the questions you find yourself asking as you attempt to decide who had been lying all that time.All this: the style and substance, plot and gimick, performance and editing, together, adds up to one of the best, most distinctive films of 2001.",5,A Noir among Noirs,1034726400,"10 16, 2002",2002,1452,"['difficult', 'think', 'more', 'engrossing', 'movie', 'then', 'Memento', 'Chris', 'Nolan', 'took', 'good', 'idea', 'man', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'attempting', 'avenge', 'wife', 'murder', 'threw', 'gimmick', 'slick', 'backward', 'presentation', 'created', 'masterwork', 'opening', 'where', 'Polaroid', 'undevelops', 'classy', 'lead-in', 'style', 'just', 'start.The', 'backwards', 'style', 'more', 'then', 'gimmick', 'plot', 'mostly', 'told', 'ending', 'scene', 'beginning', 'prior', 'scene', 'intercut', 'black', 'white', 'footage', 'mainly', 'plot', 'exposition', 'carefully', 'second', 'time', ""'ll"", 'see', 'Nolan', 'geniusGuy', 'Pearce', 'performance', 'Lenny', 'not', 'key', 'film', 'effective', 'can', 'feel', 'Lenny', 'confusion', 'time', 'time', 'again', 'What', 'just', 'happened', 'Carrie-Anne', 'Moss', 'Joe', 'Pantoliano', 'are', 'equally', 'effective', 'are', 'never', 'quite', 'sure', 'why', ""'re"", 'doing', 'what', 'do', 'more', 'then', 'Lenny', 'is.The', 'ending', 'err', 'middle', 'one', 'strongest', 'most', 'confusing', 'events', 'film', 'Every', 'thing', 'witnessed', 'first', 'shot', 'movie', 'seen', 'new', 'light', 'questions', 'are', 'answered', 'new', 'ones', 'are', 'posed', 'true', 'good', 'Noir', 'not', 'way', 'questions', 'find', 'asking', 'attempt', 'decide', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'lying', 'style', 'substance', 'plot', 'gimick', 'performance', 'editing', 'together', 'up', 'one', 'best', 'most', 'distinctive', 'films', '2001']",Memento VHS

The most significant manifestation of Leonard's injuries is that his short-term memory has been destroyed; and now he is hunting John G to get revenge. Because Leonard can't create new memories, he now must store his clues on little notes, on Polaroid photographs, or on his body with home made tattoos. Also, Leonard meets two persons: Teddy (Joe Pantoliano) and Natalie (Carrie-Anne Moss), they seem to help Leonard, but he doesn't trust them completely.The narrative is told in reverse, ""Memento"" begins with the end of the story, but don't take nothing for granted, there will be a lot of plot twists throughout the movie.

The only difference is that instead of telling the story in an archetypical revenge tale structure, it is told through an inventive and effective cinematic approach. The way director Christopher Nolan conducts his film calls to mind the cinematic great Alfred Hitchcock's 1954 masterpiece, ""Rear Window"". In both films, the audience is trapped, along with the protagonist, in a restricted and constrained environment.  In the case of ""Rear Window"", the protagonist is physically trapped; and in the case of ""Memento"", the protagonist is mentally handicapped. Because of the directors' skillful manipulations, the audiences in both films are able to experience exactly the same frustration, fear, and other mental processes as the protagonists. Another thing that I especially like about ""Memento"" is its intentional ambiguity. At the end of the film, additional confusion is deliberately added to an already hard-to-follow reverse-chronological plotline. One might suspect perhaps Leonard did, indeed, confused his own story with that of Sammy's. This brilliant touch highlights the unreliability of memories, which is, more or less, what the movie is all about: memories are often tainted by the seven sins, and facts are independent of what is, and isn't, encoded in one's memory. As well, the ambiguous ending gives the film an almost Lynchian hue, which makes this interesting film even more thought provoking.",4,&quot;Rear Window&quot;-calibre filmmaking,1006560000,"11 24, 2001",2001,1549,"['story', 'vengeance', 'probably', 'older', 'time', 'Memento', 'one', 'such', 'tried-and-proved', 'tale', 'retribution', 'only', 'difference', 'instead', 'telling', 'story', 'archetypical', 'revenge', 'tale', 'structure', 'told', 'inventive', 'effective', 'cinematic', 'approach', 'way', 'director', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'film', 'mind', 'cinematic', 'great', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', '1954', 'masterpiece', 'Rear', 'Window', 'films', 'audience', 'trapped', 'protagonist', 'restricted', 'constrained', 'environment', 'case', 'Rear', 'Window', 'protagonist', 'physically', 'trapped', 'case', 'Memento', 'protagonist', 'mentally', 'handicapped', 'directors', 'skillful', 'manipulations', 'audiences', 'films', 'are', 'able', 'experience', 'exactly', 'same', 'frustration', 'fear', 'other', 'mental', 'processes', 'protagonists', 'thing', 'especially', 'like', 'Memento', 'intentional', 'ambiguity', 'end', 'film', 'additional', 'confusion', 'deliberately', 'added', 'already', 'hard-to-follow', 'reverse-chronological', 'plotline', 'One', 'might', 'suspect', 'perhaps', 'Leonard', 'did', 'indeed', 'confused', 'own', 'story', 'Sammy', 'brilliant', 'touch', 'highlights', 'unreliability', 'memories', 'more', 'less', 'what', 'movie', 'memories', 'are', 'often', 'tainted', 'seven', 'sins', 'facts', 'are', 'independent', 'what', ""n't"", 'encoded', 'one', 'memory', 'well', 'ambiguous', 'ending', 'film', 'almost', 'Lynchian', 'hue', 'interesting', 'film', 'even', 'more', 'thought', 'provoking']",Memento VHS

Mainly because the film plays out backwards, and nobody seems to ever know what's going on. But hey, that's why I love it. Guy Pearce perfectly plays Leonard Shelby, a man who has a rare form of amnesia that allows him to remember everything from his past right up until the incident that took his memory away, but makes him forget everything that happened just 15 minutes ago. Throughout the whole film he has only two friends, but are they really his friends? And, since he's searching for his wife's killer but can't remember any clue he may stumble upon along the way, he has them tattooed all over his body. But are they really clues? Who knows. Because Leonard can't remember what went down 15 minutes ago, we're not allowed to know either. That's why the film literally plays out backwards: to give the audience a sense of what it would be like to suffer from a disorder that leaves you bewildered and clueless. It's the ultimate way to interact with a fictitious character. At the film's end, you may still feel bewildered and clueless, but that is what's so great about it - this has never been done before. &quot;Memento&quot; has become an instant classic, and was hands-down the best film of 2001.

It's a great murder thriller, a wonderfully acted masterpiece, and a storyline worth your attention.Christopher Nolan does a great editing job (subliminal messages, anyone?). The main point to the story revolves around Leoard Shelby (Pierce) , a man with ""a condition"" who is trying to solve the murder of his wife. And with that bit of information, you'd think you'd seen it all. But, the actors, the plot, the storyline, and how it's all plays out is far more engaging.You get to put the pieces together with Lenny, and try to figure out the unsavory characters, the trustworhy friends, and no one is what they seem. The real highlight is not in the ending, but in the way the story is told to the audience. (Just to hint: there are two storylines that climax, and the way you get there is awesome!) It's this type of story-telling that sets the movie apart from many other murder mysteries.Not that you won't get the movie in one sitting, but half of the fun is not understanding the movie chronologically, but trying to uncover all the plot devices and subliminal schemes Nolan purposefully inserts throughout the movie.Of course, the cast is excellent. And what I like most is that there aren't too many auxillary characters.

Between each of these segments, there is a black and white segment of the protagonist on the phone with an unidentified person. How these segments fit in time with the rest of the story isn't clear, even on repeat viewings.The narrative device simply makes the story too confusing for a movie audience. DVD viewers can replay segments to catch details and clear up confusion.Whether they will want to or not is another question. This film has an overabundance of murder, delusions, revenge, greed, drugs, lies, manipulation, tatoos, violence, and despicable acts of one kind or another to qualify as film noir. But even in film noir at least one of the characters should deserve some sympathy. In this movie, none of the characters do. In the end, we are asked to believe that the main character would choose to become a serial murderer killing people that, at the time he makes this choice, he knows have nothing to do with the attack. His only reason is just to give his life some semblance of a purpose. Nothing in his background makes this action believable.Even puzzle fans who persist in trying to understand what is going on will be frustrated by the movies plot holes, red herrings, and inconsistencies.The main character is supposed to remember everything that happened before the attack, and not be able to make any memories since. But he doesn't remember some things that happened before the attack, and he does remember some things afterward that are inconsistent with his supposed mental condition. He remembers exactly what his mental condition is. How? He can't remember if he's chasing someone or if they're chasing him, but he remembers that he drove to the location, where the car is, how to get back to it, which car it is and where the keys are. How? He remembers that he's supposed to take pictures to help him remember. He remembers that he's taken pictures, and where they are. He remembers that he needs notes to help him remember and he remembers that he's supposed to look for those notes.The real story of how his wife died is not credible. It's inconsistent with his mental condition after the attack. It's simply not believable that someone in his mental condition would have been in a position to do what he supposedly did. In addition, one of the other major characters' actions are inexplicable. That character keeps turning up with no apparent motivation, knowing things that the character has no way of knowing.Tatoos are important in this film. The protagonist believes most of the tatoo ""facts."" In his condition, how does he remember to believe them? The protagonist has a tatoo that says ""never answer the phone."" Notes are pushed under his door telling him to answer the phone. But why? Why not just knock on the door? So what does he do? He answers the phone. And why is not answering the phone important? He's so easy to dupe in person, the phone doesn't create any bigger threat. Yet he spends much of the movie on the phone.At the end of the movie, he's shown in bed with his wife. He has a tatoo that we've never seen before. It says: ""I've Done It."" Presumably he's imagining this. But imagining this tatoo is completely inconsistent with his mental state and motivation at the time.Memento is a challenging trip.

However, lazy viewers beware - the central theme of this film is how we restructure our own past via our memories to make sense of our lives. As in life, not every ""memory"" you will see is ""true"". The cinematography gives the only clues - there is absolutely no atmosphere at all in the main storyline, but the ""flashback"" sequences are stylized based on time, location and condition to help the viewer make sense of the film as a whole. Given some EFFORT, viewers will figure out what is ""true"" in the context of the film.

Guy Pearce plays a man who cannot make new memories - he forgets everything he has been through since a horrific incident that cost him his memory and his wife. He keeps himself aware of his progress on the quest for his wifes' killer via scribbled notes, annotated Polaroids and tattoos of the most crucial ""facts"" in his quest. Viewers adapt quickly and the technique actually increases suspense. It also makes the film hysterically and unexpectedly funny in places. The acting is understated - the characters act like people, not actors - quite refreshing. Guy Pearce is perfect trying to convince everyone, himself included, that he ""knows"" what he's doing and has his ""facts"" straight. Carrie Ann Moss is GREAT as a bartender who helps Our Hero - more or less. The only thing keeping me from awarding 5 stars is that the DVD extras are pathetic. You get trailers, a couple (literally, two) pictures of the tattoos of the main character, the film website, a copy of ""Memento Mori"" - the excellent short story on which the film is based - and an interview with director Chris Nolan. The interview is very good, but the only extra worthy of the name. I would have paid extra for an option to play the film in ""real time"", just for kicks. However, the film is excellent and a definite ""buy me"". Finally, I leave with a primer for the unobservant:** Black and white sequences of Guy in his hotel IMMEDIATELY PRECEDE the film time frame and move in NORMAL time (i.e., forward). All other ""flashbacks"" are keyed to specific time frames and types of events, but to discuss them, I'd reveal too much. Suffice to say, there is a logical scheme to the flashbacks that will tell the careful viewer exactly what happened - more or less - by the end of the film.

This movie will pull you in from the start, mystify you for 113 minutes, and will leave you stunned at the end. This is not your typical revenge movie, because both the story and the storytelling are very original. The reason being that this story is told backwards. You watch the scenes of the film in their reverse chronological order, which leaves you wondering not &quot;what happens next,&quot; but rather &quot;what just happened?&quot;Leonard (Pearce) is on a personal mission to discover the identity of the man who murdered his wife. But to complicate matters, Leonard has a rare memory condition which he recieved the night his wife was killed. He no longer has any short-term memory. He can rememeber who he is, and everything that happened before his memory condition started, but he can't form new memories. He relies on notes and photographs to continually remind himslef what he is doing, who his friends are, and where he has been.The story is told in reverse order so the viewer can sympathize with his condition. Leonard doesn't know where he just was, or what he just did; so this way the viewer doesn't know either. The suspenseful drama that unfolds is like no other you have ever seen. It is a unique story in that you know how it ends, but you watch to find out how it began. With every passing scene you go a little further back in Leonard's life, learning what he no longer remembers, until you finally reach a shocking finale (beginning?) that will make you want to watch it again on the spot.This is one of those movies about which you will discover something new each time you watch. The discussions you will have with your friends after seeing it will never get boring. I watched this movie 4 times during the first week that I owned it, and then let someone borrow it. Every day, I called that person almost begging him to return it so I could watch it again. There isn't much on the DVD by way of extras, but ragardless I highly recommend that you BUY (not rent) this movie. It leaves a very lasting impression.

541625,AQUVTQFFXP4AC,B00003CXZ3,"Andariel Halo ""Disillusioned Smark""","[5, 7]","***SPOILERS***Finishing watching this for the 5th or 6th time today, I learned yet another piece to the puzzle of this movie which put it together in a way that blew me away as much as the first time I watched it.I can go in depth into the reviews and how good the movie is, but that's been done already to death.  I'll explain to you still confused how this movie works, starting from the true beginning- All the black-and-white scenes come before the movie... Leonard is already on his journey attempting to find John G. and being lead by Officer Gammell on the phone (Teddy).  He finally finds the ""John G."" guy, a drug dealer called Jimmy Grant, and kills him.  It's revealed now that Teddy has already helped Leonard find the killer of his wife the year before, but since then he has only been using Leonard's condition and his need for vengeance for his own shady means---he set up Jimmy the drug dealer by pretending to have $200,000 worth of methamphetamines for sale, and planning to steal the money for himself.- Leonard realizes Teddy's plan, and distracts Teddy by throwing his keys in a bush, then he decides that if Teddy is going to be making him chase around John G.'s or James G.'s as long as possible for his own benefit, he's going to chase his own John G.... Teddy himself.  So he writes himself clues about Teddy, by writing ""Don't believe his lies"" on the back of his photo, and tattooing his license plate number on his body.  Thus Leonard is plotting revenge again, but not against his wife's murderer as he thinks, but against the guy who's been using him to kill people.- Thus the color scenes begin (unveiled in reverse in the movie) in which Leonard is trying to follow the clues to John G.  Teddy (the John G. Leonard is after) is trying his hardest to throw Leonard off course, and to get him to give up.  He then encounters Natalie, and she finds out that Teddy was involved in her boyfriend (Jimmy Grant, the drug dealer)'s death, and attempts to use Leonard to try and kill Teddy.  She doesn't realize he is already attempting to ""find"" him and kill him, as he set himself on this course to begin with (before losing his memory at that moment)- There must be some sort of ability for Leonard to remember things and his memory distorts these things the way he thinks it.  The big clue to this is when he tells Teddy that ""memory can change the color of a car, it can change the shape of a room"" and concludes with the true beginning, when Teddy reveals to him that there IS no ""Sammy Jankis"" as he thinks... the character he's been talking about throughout the movie was a fraud, and had no wife, whereas the story of his disillusioned wife was actually Leonard's wife, and that Sammy was actually Leonard.Really this was truly a unique film, and spellbinding.  It's so complex, you can't watch it only once.  You learn something new with every viewing.And the film also has a very very dark, grim aspect about it.  Aside from the fact that he can never live a normal life again, he can't trust anything or anyone, and he doesn't even realize he's a murderer, and will never remember that it was he who set himself against Teddy after learning that Teddy had been using him for his own selfish purposes.",5,"Learn more with each time you view it.

541626,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00003CXZ3,Andrew Ellington,"[4, 4]","`Memento' is probably one of the only films that must be watched from beginning to end, no if ands or buts, in order for it to be even enjoyed.  I mean this with all sincerity, if you miss the first thirty seconds you're screwed.  That said, when caught from the very beginning `Memento' is also one of the most enjoyable and richly rewarding films to be watched.  It's a true stunner of a film, from plot to execution, and is one that will instigate lots of post-watching conversations.  The acting is top-notch, especially from the likes of Guy Pearce (looking like a scraggly Brad Pitt covered in interesting tattoos) who just blew me away here.  I've never really been a fan of Pearce.  In `L.A. Confidential' I felt he was the weakest link and pretty much everything else I see him in I just don't feel him, but here he just soars.  The direction of the film is a thing of beauty really, and Christopher Nolan has pretty much established himself as one of our greatest new-wave directors.  He truly gets into his material and delivers this masterful story in a very unique way which proves to be the grandest embellishment.The film centers around Leonard Shelby, a man who's lost his wife to rape and murder and in the process lost his mind.  He has set out to find the man who did this and punish him.  The movie opens with him killing a man named Teddy.  This is the end of the film, or I should say the end of the story.  Teddy is, for the sake of discussion, the man who raped and murdered Leonard's wife.  The film them jumps back in ten minute segments until we get to the beginning of the film, or should I say the beginning of the story, where we uncover who Leonard came to this conclusion.  What makes this direction so interesting is that the film gives you just enough information to keep you guessing.  It tells you just a little bit and then takes you back and fills you in, leaving new doors open for interpretation before taking you back again and filling you in.  It's truly a masterpiece of a film and executed so well it's a real shame the academy snubbed Nolan his directing nomination.Like I mentioned, Pearce is a spectacle in this film, but there are two other performances within `Memento' that deserve attention.  For one we have Carrie-Anne Moss' who plays a barmaid who is helping Leonard for reasons yet to be uncovered.  Is she really concerned with Leonard's plight or is she using him for her own selfish gain?  Moss surprised me here because I'm really not familiar with her work aside from `The Matrix' and a film like `The Matrix' doesn't really allow the actors to shine, but here she delves into the meat of her character and delivers a great performance.  The real star though, the actor that outshines them all, is Joe Pantoliano of `The Sopranos' fame (yes, that's Ralph).  As Teddy Joe is spot on and delivers an exciting, fresh and completely absorbing performance.  It's funny because my wife and I are HUGE `Sopranos' buffs and when we saw `Ralph' we just about died (since his character was one we loathed from start to his finish) but here he completely sheds his `Sopranos' persona and delivers a separate performance altogether and it paid off wonderfully for him.`Memento' is a film for the ages.  It's one of those movies that may not be your cup of tea, and for that I understand, but really, there isn't much to dislike with this film (that is if you catch it from the start).  There are so many films where one is advised to sit back and turn your mind off but here I'm telling you to sit up and turn your mind on because `Memento' is the type of film that will keep you thinking, keep you guessing, and in the process keep you completely entertained.  The end, or should I say the beginning, plays out in a wonderfully inventive way that is unexpected yet ultimately rewarding.  It packs a huge `wow' factor and I just love that about this film.

The story revolves around Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce), an ex-insurance claims investigator who had to give up his job after he lost his ability to create new memories.  He lives by taking photos and keeping notes of his life.The last thing he remembers is two men raping and killing his wife.  So he has dedicated his new life to finding- and killing- the man who killed his wife and took away his memory.  All he knows about the man are the few facts that he pulled from the police file from the accident: his name is either John or James, and his surname's initial is G (John or James G.).  The man has a connection to illegal drugs, and he has a license plate number.  Along the way, he is joined by Teddy (Joe Pantoliano), a guy who he fears he cannot trust, and Natalie, a woman helping him out of pity.  Unfortunately for Leonard, though, his notes can be manipulated, and he soon realizes that no one can be fully trusted.The great thing about the way this movie is told is that, since we haven't seen the events leading up to a scene, we are just as in the dark about the situation as Leonard, and just when we think we have something figured out, our beliefs can be shattered in an instant when the truth is revealed.You'd think that with the end at the beginning, it would be impossible for there to be a twist ending (I know I thought so), but just the opposite is true; the final scene of this film will completely blow you away.This is one of the few thrillers as of late that succeeds in it's mission statement; to keep the viewer guessing and to deliver a killer twist ending.

541628,A2SBGTE825H1N3,B00003CXZ3,ANDY COLE,"[2, 3]","This movie came as a huge surprise on me in a very positive way. Once in a while there are screenwriters and/or directors who really want to do something extraordinary to impress the viewers of their production. As an example, Groundhog Day had the main character relive the same day over and over again for ages until he finally got the girl of his dreams in the end, and it worked. Fight Club also gave you an intense story where two very different characters slowly evolved to a movie climax rarely seen, because to most people the answer to all the story's conflicts is to unimaginable. A closer example to ""Memento"" is ""The Usual Suspects"" from 1994, which gave you a very exciting story set in the criminal underworld run by Kayzer Zose, a man everybody fears but no one knows who he is...a lot like the main character in ""Memento.""The story is about insurance investigator Leonard, who suffers from short-term memory loss. Leonard got injured after intervening on his wife's murder. The murderer was still there when Leonard walked in on them, thus the main character ended up with a cracked skull (figuratively speaking).The movie's opening scene is where most crime stories would end; the main character gets his wife's murderer. The rest of the movie is built upon the fragments of memories that led Leonard getting his guy, in other words this movie is kind of told backwards, starting from the mentioned opening scene and ending where the whole situation actually begun... sound confusing? Well, I was confused for about fifteen minutes but once I understood what was going on the rest was just pure genius. At one point I asked myself: ""How can a story told backwards actually get more exciting by the minute?"" As much as I would give you some information about this, you really have to see the movie for yourself to actually understand what a gem this really is. The tension curve is always rising, with an ending so surprisingly good that this movie is up there with stunners like aforementioned ""The Usual Suspects"" and ""Fight Club.""This is a totally unmissable movie for lovers of the crime/mystery genre.",5,Ignorance is NOT bliss,1016064000,"03 14, 2002",2002,2122,"['movie', 'came', 'huge', 'surprise', 'very', 'positive', 'way', 'Once', 'while', 'are', 'screenwriters', 'and/or', 'directors', 'who', 'really', 'want', 'do', 'something', 'extraordinary', 'impress', 'viewers', 'production', 'example', 'Groundhog', 'Day', 'had', 'main', 'character', 'relive', 'same', 'day', 'over', 'again', 'ages', 'finally', 'got', 'girl', 'dreams', 'end', 'worked', 'Fight', 'Club', 'also', 'gave', 'intense', 'story', 'where', 'two', 'very', 'different', 'characters', 'slowly', 'evolved', 'movie', 'climax', 'rarely', 'seen', 'most', 'people', 'answer', 'story', 'conflicts', 'unimaginable', 'closer', 'example', 'Memento', 'Usual', 'Suspects', '1994', 'gave', 'very', 'exciting', 'story', 'set', 'criminal', 'underworld', 'run', 'Kayzer', 'Zose', 'man', 'everybody', 'one', 'who', 'lot', 'main', 'character', 'Memento', 'story', 'insurance', 'investigator', 'Leonard', 'who', 'short-term', 'memory', 'loss', 'Leonard', 'got', 'injured', 'intervening', 'wife', 'murder', 'murderer', 'was', 'still', 'there', 'when', 'Leonard', 'walked', 'thus', 'main', 'character', 'ended', 'up', 'cracked', 'skull', 'figuratively', 'speaking', '.The', 'movie', 'opening', 'scene', 'where', 'most', 'crime', 'stories', 'would', 'end', 'main', 'character', 'wife', 'murderer', 'rest', 'movie', 'built', 'fragments', 'memories', 'led', 'Leonard', 'getting', 'guy', 'other', 'words', 'movie', 'kind', 'told', 'backwards', 'starting', 'mentioned', 'opening', 'scene', 'ending', 'where', 'whole', 'situation', 'actually', 'begun', 'sound', 'confusing', 'Well', 'was', 'confused', 'about', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'once', 'understood', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'rest', 'was', 'just', 'pure', 'genius', 'one', 'point', 'asked', 'How', 'can', 'story', 'told', 'backwards', 'actually', 'get', 'more', 'exciting', 'minute', 'As', 'much', 'would', 'give', 'information', 'really', 'have', 'see', 'movie', 'actually', 'understand', 'what', 'gem', 'really', 'tension', 'curve', 'always', 'rising', 'ending', 'so', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'movie', 'there', 'stunners', 'aforementioned', 'Usual', 'Suspects', 'Fight', 'Club', 'totally', 'unmissable', 'movie', 'lovers', 'crime/mystery', 'genre']",Memento VHS

With as little prior knowledge as possible. Really. Trust me on this.That said, I know I'm basically just adding, with little consequence, to the near-universal (and quite well-documented) breathless praise that's already been showered on Memento. But so what? It's that good. I'll make it simple: This is one of the most fascinating films to come around in recent times (perhaps ever?). One of the few that I could describe as &quot;mind-blowing&quot; with a straight face. One that can be watched over and over--in fact it practically demands it--without getting dull. The script is snappy and the cast is top-notch. The backwards storytelling may be just a gimmick, but it's quite a clever one, especially in the context of this story. Not only does it raise the classic suspense/noir tactics to another level, but it puts the viewer in Leonard's head, forcing us at first to see things as fractured and stilted as he does. It's quite an experience.Just see it. Really. This is the kind of movie that makes you feel like part of a secret club after watching it. The kind you get into heated discussions with strangers over.

It also has the standard trailers.

541635,A1QG4TLIYZRL7L,B00003CXZ3,"Arthur Blenheim ""arthurblenheim""","[1, 12]","""Regression""I picked this topic to speak on when I remembered laughing at myself the night my film class and I watched Memento, a movie based on Memento Mori, the name of the short story.  I turned up my car music, left the place, and headed the wrong direction on the highway, ""idiot!""  I was so used to going to my friend's house; my car just automatically steered me into going the opposite direction of my home.  He wouldn't be available that week, and I knew this because I had just spoken with him by cell phone before getting into my car.  Yet, I'm not so sure I have no explanation.  After watching Memento, I realized the satire of going through motions that have no memory.  I laughed out loud, alone, and in my car when I realized the occasion.I remember Leonard Shelby.  He is the main character of Memento.  Leonard Shelby had a memory dysfunction.  I don't suppose I acted much differently than Leonard Shelby.  Leonard Shelby escaped an asylum!  Memento is the story of a guy that can have a conversation with someone and, by the end of it, did not know what was said at the beginning of it.  By the time he got done with the movie, he was quite a unique individual.  His actions were attributable to a memory dysfunction.Movie critics are important to movies.  They make important decisions in front of viewers or readers everywhere.  They affect a film's interpretation.  They are so engaging, they occasionally get to be Roger Ebert and Leonard Maltin.Some people prefer to remember the instances they choose, like when a wife receives insulin.  She must be diabetic.  Some create the likeness of something that isn't really there by filling in the blanks.  ""The best jigsaw puzzles are the ones with a few pieces missing.""All anyone has to do is tell a good story.  That is all people really want to hear.  If I can do that, I am doing my job.  This makes me necessary.Getting people to assume the untrue makes sense.  One can better understand this when realizing their wants and needs which may have nothing to do with reality.  People have a motivation that's in the subconscious mind, and people understand by drawing conclusions in places where there are no real explanations.  The reason to watch this movie is to believe what happens is the truth.  It doesn't matter if it's just a movie, because everyone knows that, anyway.I bought the movie because I'm a good student to my college course.  I wanted to make a sensible statement when my instructor asked for one from me.The order in which I put my story is important to the theme.  For instance, when Leonard Shelby's mental state takes advantage of his physical state, he doesn't know a method for how to act.  It bothers him greatly to know his wife is gone.

That being said; here goes.A THINKING MOVIE, NOT A RELAXING ONE:If you like a movie that makes you put your head in gear, this is it.  Pay attention very closely to what goes on in this movie.I plan on watching it again and again, because there is some loose threads that just don't fit.UNUSUAL PRESENTATION BUT DONE REALLY WELL:Are you a Pulp Fiction or an X-files fan?  You might really like this.  No, no aliens, just an unusual story line.  I have to be careful not to ruin it for you.  This movie is not only different in that it is about a guy with short-term memory loss, but it is presented differently.  In a way you as the viewer are forced to piece together the movie, just like the main character does in his notes.  It is really well done.BASIC STORY LINE:In a nutshell, Lenny is a guy that has short-term memory loss.  Leave the room after talking to him for 15 minutes and he will forget who you are.  He remembers his past, his wife, her attack. Everything is up for grabs after that.  However, he wants his revenge for her attack.  This is his theme and his tatoos help piece together this puzzle.ACTORS:Guy Pearce memorable in L. A. Confidential as the rule-stuck young cop is almost unrecognizable in his bleached-blond look as Lenny.  He does an admirable job showing the confusion of a young man with a brain disorder that literally forces him to live in the moment.  Notes, tatoos and Polariod photos take the place of his memory.Joe Pantoliano from the Matrix plays Teddie, his sleazy accomplice, providing confusion and direction.  Carrie Anne Moss also from the Matrix is Teddie's counter-balance.  Who does a guy with no memory trust?NOT A MOVIE TO RELAX BY, BUT UNIQUELY ENJOYABLE:If you want to think, this is a great movie.  If you want to coast, watch something else and save this when you want to get your mind in gear.  Some people like movies like this, some people hate them.  It may also just depend on your mood.IF AT FIRST YOU DON'T LIKE IT, GIVE IT AT LEAST 1/2 HOUR:When I first started watching this movie, my thought was, it was kind of tedious.  Great a weirdly unfolding movie.  Then when a couple of things happened that I didn't expect, it really got my attention.  Give it at least 1/2 hour to get yours.Enjoy.",5,"Wow, I just have to say it is a thinking movie",1005350400,"11 10, 2001",2001,2344,"['Listen', 'generally', 'get', 'lousy', 'ratings', 'movie', 'reviews', 'am', 'prepared', 'being', 'said', 'here', 'goes.A', 'THINKING', 'MOVIE', 'NOT', 'A', 'RELAXING', 'ONE', 'like', 'movie', 'put', 'head', 'gear', 'Pay', 'attention', 'very', 'closely', 'what', 'movie.I', 'plan', 'watching', 'again', 'again', 'loose', 'threads', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'fit.UNUSUAL', 'PRESENTATION', 'BUT', 'DONE', 'REALLY', 'WELL', 'Are', 'Pulp', 'Fiction', 'X-files', 'fan', 'might', 'really', 'like', 'No', 'aliens', 'just', 'unusual', 'story', 'line', 'have', 'be', 'careful', 'not', 'ruin', 'movie', 'not', 'only', 'different', 'guy', 'short-term', 'memory', 'loss', 'presented', 'differently', 'way', 'viewer', 'are', 'forced', 'piece', 'together', 'movie', 'just', 'main', 'character', 'notes', 'really', 'well', 'done.BASIC', 'STORY', 'LINE', 'nutshell', 'Lenny', 'guy', 'short-term', 'memory', 'loss', 'Leave', 'room', 'talking', '15', 'minutes', 'will', 'forget', 'who', 'are', 'past', 'wife', 'attack', 'Everything', 'up', 'grabs', 'However', 'revenge', 'attack', 'theme', 'tatoos', 'help', 'piece', 'together', 'puzzle.ACTORS', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'memorable', 'L.', 'A', 'Confidential', 'rule-stuck', 'young', 'cop', 'almost', 'unrecognizable', 'bleached-blond', 'look', 'Lenny', 'admirable', 'job', 'showing', 'confusion', 'young', 'man', 'brain', 'disorder', 'literally', 'live', 'moment', 'Notes', 'tatoos', 'Polariod', 'photos', 'take', 'place', 'memory.Joe', 'Pantoliano', 'Matrix', 'Teddie', 'sleazy', 'accomplice', 'providing', 'confusion', 'direction', 'Carrie', 'Anne', 'Moss', 'also', 'Matrix', 'Teddie', 'counter-balance', 'Who', 'guy', 'memory', 'trust', 'MOVIE', 'TO', 'RELAX', 'BY', 'BUT', 'UNIQUELY', 'ENJOYABLE', 'want', 'think', 'great', 'movie', 'want', 'coast', 'watch', 'something', 'else', 'save', 'when', 'want', 'get', 'mind', 'gear', 'people', 'movies', 'people', 'hate', 'may', 'also', 'just', 'depend', 'mood.IF', 'AT', 'FIRST', 'YOU', 'DO', ""N'T"", 'LIKE', 'IT', 'GIVE', 'IT', 'AT', 'LEAST', '1/2', 'HOUR', 'When', 'first', 'started', 'watching', 'movie', 'thought', 'was', 'was', 'kind', 'tedious', 'Great', 'weirdly', 'unfolding', 'movie', 'Then', 'when', 'couple', 'things', 'happened', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'really', 'got', 'attention', 'Give', 'least', '1/2', 'hour', 'get', 'yours.Enjoy']",Memento VHS
541638,A2C27IQUH9N1Z,B00003CXZ3,audrey,"[25, 27]","Alfred Hitchcock was the master of Cinema's Rule One: 'Do not tell. SHOW.' Director/screenwriter Christopher Nolan takes that philosophy a step further in this film noir masterpiece by controlling not only the viewer's visual sense but their perception of time as well, reconstructing the protagonist's attempts to make sense of his world by reading the clues he leaves for himself (and us) and deciding who to trust in order to understand not only what occurs, but why. In effect, Nolan has rewritten the rule: 'Do not show. EXPERIENCE.'The cast is exceptional, Guy Pearce in particular, and traditional film noir elements are executed very well, with haunting music, taut cinematography, smart dialogue, effective voiceover, and a constant search for motive. Humor is used sparingly and effectively. This is really an editor's film, and Dody Dorn deserves an Oscar nomination for editing this gem.As for the DVD edition, it is a mixed bag. Though operationally a bit buggy, cinematically and artistically the special features are creative and fun. For instance, interesting scenes run behind the menus, and many film clips appear framed as Polaroid camera shots, both fun to watch and relevant to the film's concept. The original idea for the film was supplied by the director's brother Jonathan, who wrote a short story based on the same idea and designed the film's web site; information rendered from outside the time frame of the film, viewable on the DVD as newspaper clippings and notes by Guy Pearce's Leonard, are adapted from that web site. Also included are Jonathan Nolan's short story, an Independent Film Channel interview with Christopher Nolan, trailers from Memento and an earlier Nolan film, cast and director biographies, subtitles in English or Spanish, and a tattoo gallery (which looked interesting, but I couldn't get it to work on my Power Mac G4).  I wish more DVDs would incorporate this kind of material.I was disappointed because I'd heard that on the DVD you could watch the film as if it was shot running forward but that is not here, unless you count running the chapters in reverse from the Chapter Selection feature. I would also have liked to have seen behind-the-scenes footage, especially storyboards.This is a great film to watch with a group (as long as they don't talk during the film) so you can talk about it afterward. Nolan and crew can be proud of this fine film. The DVD extras could have been better, but they are still fun to play with.",5,"spectacular film, average dvd bells and whistles",1003622400,"10 21, 2001",2001,2484,"['Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'was', 'master', 'Cinema', 'Rule', 'One', ""'Do"", 'not', 'tell', 'SHOW', 'Director/screenwriter', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'philosophy', 'step', 'further', 'film', 'noir', 'masterpiece', 'controlling', 'not', 'only', 'viewer', 'visual', 'sense', 'perception', 'time', 'well', 'reconstructing', 'protagonist', 'attempts', 'make', 'sense', 'world', 'reading', 'clues', 'deciding', 'who', 'trust', 'order', 'understand', 'not', 'only', 'what', 'why', 'effect', 'Nolan', 'rewritten', 'rule', ""'Do"", 'not', 'show', 'EXPERIENCE', 'cast', 'exceptional', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'particular', 'traditional', 'film', 'noir', 'elements', 'are', 'executed', 'very', 'well', 'haunting', 'music', 'taut', 'cinematography', 'smart', 'dialogue', 'effective', 'voiceover', 'constant', 'search', 'motive', 'Humor', 'used', 'sparingly', 'effectively', 'really', 'editor', 'film', 'Dody', 'Dorn', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'editing', 'gem.As', 'DVD', 'edition', 'mixed', 'bag', 'Though', 'operationally', 'bit', 'buggy', 'cinematically', 'artistically', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'creative', 'fun', 'instance', 'interesting', 'scenes', 'run', 'menus', 'many', 'film', 'clips', 'appear', 'framed', 'Polaroid', 'camera', 'shots', 'fun', 'watch', 'relevant', 'film', 'concept', 'original', 'idea', 'film', 'was', 'supplied', 'director', 'brother', 'Jonathan', 'who', 'wrote', 'short', 'story', 'based', 'same', 'idea', 'designed', 'film', 'web', 'site', 'information', 'rendered', 'time', 'frame', 'film', 'viewable', 'DVD', 'newspaper', 'clippings', 'notes', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'Leonard', 'are', 'adapted', 'web', 'site', 'Also', 'included', 'are', 'Jonathan', 'Nolan', 'short', 'story', 'Independent', 'Film', 'Channel', 'interview', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'trailers', 'Memento', 'earlier', 'Nolan', 'film', 'cast', 'director', 'biographies', 'subtitles', 'English', 'Spanish', 'tattoo', 'gallery', 'looked', 'interesting', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'work', 'Power', 'Mac', 'G4', 'wish', 'more', 'DVDs', 'would', 'incorporate', 'kind', 'material.I', 'was', 'disappointed', ""'d"", 'heard', 'DVD', 'could', 'watch', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'running', 'forward', 'not', 'here', 'count', 'running', 'chapters', 'reverse', 'Chapter', 'Selection', 'feature', 'would', 'also', 'have', 'liked', 'have', 'seen', 'behind-the-scenes', 'footage', 'especially', 'storyboards.This', 'great', 'film', 'watch', 'group', 'as', 'long', 'do', ""n't"", 'talk', 'film', 'can', 'talk', 'afterward', 'Nolan', 'crew', 'can', 'be', 'proud', 'fine', 'film', 'DVD', 'extras', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'are', 'still', 'fun', 'play']",Memento VHS

If you are frustated by watching this movie you need to see it again and pay careful attention. It is hard for some people to understand but is very rewarding after you grasp everything that is happening. Christopher Nolan was saying alot of things with this movie. Mainly, that we as humans decieve ourselves for our benefit. Do we really want the truth??? I was disturbed by the review that one person gave saying this was the worst movie they had ever seen. There are many films that I have not enjoyed but had to admit that others may enjoy the same movie very much.

541648,A2YAABMT80RLYA,B00003CXZ3,Ben Rowland,"[0, 0]","""Memento"" is one of my favorite ""hidden gems"" of 2001, and similar to movies like ""Fight Club"", ""The Usual Suspects"", and ""Dark City"", it stands out as one of the most unique.Guy Pearce plays Leonard Shelby, a man on a mission to find and punish those responsible for the murder of his wife. The problem is that after the murder, he is shocked into a state of short-term amnesia, meaning that his memory is very short term. He meets people, does things, and has encounters that he forgets almost minutes later. To counteract this condition, he covers his body in tatoos, notes, and carries a file full of information that he cannot afford to forget. Who are his friends? His enemies? It is a struggle to make that distinction.What is most interesting about ""Memento"" is the style in which it was filmed. Rather than starting from the beginning and moving to the end, ""Memento"" is shown in reverse. The movie starts at the ending, and moves backwards to show how things got to this point. The experience one gets from watching ""Memento"" is similar to what Shelby experiences in the movie. A surreal trip, which leaves you dumbfounded at the end.The acting in ""Memento"" is first rate. Guy Pearce is a very reliable and versatile actor, and this is his best role since ""LA Confidential"". Support comes from two very talented actors, Joe Pantoliano and Carrie-Anne Moss (both of ""The Matrix""). Joe Pantoliano, oddly enough, further pushes his trademark. I won't spoil what it is (it would kill the plot), but think of what happens to him in the end of ""Memento"", and rent his other movies and see how they end up for him.  Where the movie really stands out is the direction, which is a fresh approach on a very old concept (one man's revenge caper).A lot of my friends didn't like ""Memento"", most likely for the reasons listed above. They were confused, and didn't like the way the movie repeated itself (remember, it moves backwards). True, you must pay attention while watching, otherwise you will get lost. But I encourage you to watch ""Memento"" with an open mind, it is a very rewarding experience.",5,Unique and perplexing crime drama.,1031184000,"09 5, 2002",2002,2098,"['Memento', 'one', 'favorite', 'hidden', 'gems', '2001', 'similar', 'movies', 'Fight', 'Club', 'Usual', 'Suspects', 'Dark', 'City', 'out', 'one', 'most', 'unique.Guy', 'Pearce', 'Leonard', 'Shelby', 'man', 'mission', 'find', 'punish', 'responsible', 'murder', 'wife', 'problem', 'murder', 'shocked', 'state', 'short-term', 'amnesia', 'meaning', 'memory', 'very', 'short', 'term', 'people', 'things', 'encounters', 'almost', 'minutes', 'later', 'counteract', 'condition', 'body', 'tatoos', 'notes', 'file', 'full', 'information', 'can', 'not', 'afford', 'forget', 'Who', 'are', 'friends', 'enemies', 'struggle', 'make', 'distinction.What', 'most', 'interesting', 'Memento', 'style', 'was', 'filmed', 'Rather', 'starting', 'beginning', 'moving', 'end', 'Memento', 'shown', 'reverse', 'movie', 'ending', 'moves', 'backwards', 'show', 'how', 'things', 'got', 'point', 'experience', 'one', 'watching', 'Memento', 'similar', 'what', 'Shelby', 'movie', 'surreal', 'trip', 'dumbfounded', 'end.The', 'acting', 'Memento', 'first', 'rate', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'very', 'reliable', 'versatile', 'actor', 'best', 'role', 'LA', 'Confidential', 'Support', 'two', 'very', 'talented', 'actors', 'Joe', 'Pantoliano', 'Carrie-Anne', 'Moss', 'Matrix', 'Joe', 'Pantoliano', 'oddly', 'enough', 'further', 'pushes', 'trademark', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'what', 'would', 'kill', 'plot', 'think', 'what', 'end', 'Memento', 'rent', 'other', 'movies', 'see', 'how', 'end', 'up', 'Where', 'movie', 'really', 'out', 'direction', 'fresh', 'approach', 'very', 'old', 'concept', 'one', 'man', 'revenge', 'caper', '.A', 'lot', 'friends', 'did', ""n't"", 'Memento', 'most', 'likely', 'reasons', 'listed', 'above', 'were', 'confused', 'did', ""n't"", 'way', 'movie', 'repeated', 'remember', 'backwards', 'True', 'must', 'pay', 'attention', 'watching', 'otherwise', 'will', 'get', 'lost', 'encourage', 'watch', 'Memento', 'open', 'mind', 'very', 'rewarding', 'experience']",Memento VHS

He can remember everything up to the attack, but nothing afterwards for more than 10 or 15 minutes before it fades away. Yet faced with the prospect of spending the rest of his natural life as an institutionalized, non-functioning vegetable, unable to heal the emotional wound of his wife's (murder?) because he cannot ""feel time,"" cannot process his pain, our protagonist ""Leonard"" (Guy Pearce) opts instead to focus his crippled consciousness on vengeance - even though he can't possibly remember it when he acheives it - as an ""existential"" redressing of the balance of the crime. ""My wife won't be avenged until her murderer is dead; the act of killing him will avenge her; it doesn't matter if I remember doing it or not"" is Leonard's POV.So he writes himself notes compulsively and somewhat frantically, since ink on paper must substitute for working memory. The really important stuff he gets tattooed on so that nobody can deprive him of it. He takes polaroids of important people and places and writes cryptic descriptions on them. It's all a way of keeping himself vital.He actually fares pretty well, all things considered. Pearce's performance conveys a certain inherent sense of humor behind the frenzy of the character in his predicament, such as he would probably require to keep himself even marginally sane within the 15 minute gamut of his consciousness. Naturally, inevitably, he does get swindled in spite of his constant and justifiable paranoia, and because ""Memento"" is a film noir, of course the swindler (well, one of them) is a femme fatale, a spider woman in the grand tradition, played brilliantly by Carrie-Anne Moss. Yet unlike the films of the 40's, the swindle does not destroy him and is ultimately incidental - just another memory-that-was. Leonard's condition renders him amoral, unaccountable and oblivious, a being totally ""of the moment.""The scene with Moss (""Natalie"") where she shows her true colors, knowing that she can say whatever she wants without consequence, is almost as hilarious as it is vicious and intense and believable.  And the whole movie is composed of similar ""real"" moments - ""it's all in the incidental details that don't seem to matter,"" to paraphrase Leonard himself.And the way it's edited is perfect. Never before has a mere technical convention - that of beginning at the chronological end of the story and working backwards in overlapping segments - been so effective in conveying the peculiar quality of a character's psychology. You really feel as though you have a sense of what it must be like for Leonard, because you don't really know what's going on either.It's a device, but it works.

I watched this expecting unique storytelling and a great climax.Memento begins with a murder and then works its way back through the eyes of Lenny who has know short term memory.  Each scene begins with us not knowing how Lenny got there.  This is appropriate (not a gimmick) since Lenny has no idea either.I paid attention to each scene trying not to miss any details that would confuse the ending.  But there really aren't any details to miss.  The ending covers all the bases and explains everything, yet there are many unresoved questions, and I think the director Nolan wanted it that way.While Memento was unique, it was also quite humorous.  Guy Pierce did an excellent job of portraying Lenny.  Lenny seemed so trusting of everyone and since he had no memory of them, he assumed they were always being honest with him.So while this movie is dark at its core, it portrays an innocence and lightheartedness that makes it fun to watch.If you watch this movie and are somewhat confused then check out the movie's website.

Incredibly complicated yet devastatingly simple, i still didnt see any of it coming, i still dont really understand how it was all woven together, but boy am i impressed.Its hard to think of a more intelligent movie, and one that requires quite so much concentration, this isnt a popcorn and sunday afternoon movie, this one needs you awake and alert and concentrating on every sly move the narrative pulls or you could quite easily miss the beauty of this movie.Shot in an unusual style in that the movie &quot;develops&quot; much like the photographs the main character takes to help with his memory, slowly and partially.  You see it tells everything backwards, from end to beginning then end again, except the end isnt quite the end, confused? sorry, but its hard to explain.Essentially we see one scene, say five minutes worth of plot, then the next five mins shows events leading up to the part we just saw.  For instance if for instance we just saw a five minute scene starting with the character walking into a house, when thats done we see another five minute scene climaxing in him pulling up to the house.  I've explained it remarkably bad but it really is ingenious, and a crucial subplot intersects these scenes giving a nice background and an unusual twist to the overall story, as well as providing a slight relief from all the head-swirling of the main story.The story itself concerns Lenny, an ex insurance investigator whose wife was murdered, fairly straight forward except lenny suffers from a memory disorder which means he has no short term memory, thus he uses polaroids and tattoos and hand written notes to help him along his way to finding the killer, but at the same time is never sure of who people are and if he can trust them.The cast headed by Guy Pearce is generally very very good and Guy himself shows why he won rave reviews after L.A Confidential with another excellent performance.  The direction is pretty slick and extremely sly and all credit must go to the makers not just for thinking up such an intelligent story but for comitting it to film and making it work.If any downfalls of the film exist its in that it may be a little too clever for its own good, a lot of people wont have the patience to concentrate for the whole movie and may find it boring or hard work, not generally what people want from entertainment and thats a fair expectation, I know I have to be in a certain frame of mind to watch this myself and know many people to have switched off halfway in.That aside if your prepared to work with the film to its conclusion and to keep your eyes open and your mind on the plot then its an extremely rewarding experience, one that will have you gasping, full of admiration for all the players involved and with a head full of questions to which there is no answer other than possibly watching again.  The sort of film you watch and immediatly want to talk about to anyone else who has seen it, and restores faith that sometimes you can get an intricate story from somewhere other than a book.Sorry for the clumsy review, this is one movie that just seems to have that effect on me :)",5,Unforgetable,1006819200,"11 27, 2001",2001,3248,"['Three', 'months', 'seeing', 'movie', 'third', 'time', 'still', 'head', 'still', 'playing', 'games', 'Incredibly', 'complicated', 'yet', 'devastatingly', 'simple', 'i', 'still', 'didnt', 'see', 'coming', 'i', 'still', 'really', 'understand', 'how', 'was', 'woven', 'together', 'am', 'i', 'impressed.Its', 'hard', 'think', 'more', 'intelligent', 'movie', 'one', 'quite', 'so', 'much', 'concentration', 'popcorn', 'sunday', 'afternoon', 'movie', 'one', 'awake', 'alert', 'concentrating', 'sly', 'move', 'narrative', 'pulls', 'could', 'quite', 'easily', 'miss', 'beauty', 'movie.Shot', 'unusual', 'style', 'movie', 'quot', 'quot', 'much', 'photographs', 'main', 'character', 'help', 'memory', 'slowly', 'partially', 'see', 'everything', 'backwards', 'end', 'beginning', 'then', 'end', 'again', 'end', 'isnt', 'quite', 'end', 'confused', 'sorry', 'hard', 'explain.Essentially', 'see', 'one', 'scene', 'say', 'five', 'minutes', 'plot', 'then', 'next', 'five', 'mins', 'events', 'leading', 'up', 'part', 'just', 'saw', 'instance', 'instance', 'just', 'saw', 'five', 'minute', 'scene', 'starting', 'character', 'walking', 'house', 'when', 'thats', 'done', 'see', 'five', 'minute', 'scene', 'climaxing', 'pulling', 'up', 'house', ""'ve"", 'explained', 'remarkably', 'bad', 'really', 'ingenious', 'crucial', 'subplot', 'intersects', 'scenes', 'giving', 'nice', 'background', 'unusual', 'twist', 'overall', 'story', 'as', 'well', 'providing', 'slight', 'relief', 'head-swirling', 'main', 'story.The', 'story', 'Lenny', 'ex', 'insurance', 'investigator', 'wife', 'was', 'murdered', 'fairly', 'straight', 'forward', 'lenny', 'suffers', 'memory', 'disorder', 'short', 'term', 'memory', 'thus', 'polaroids', 'tattoos', 'hand', 'written', 'notes', 'help', 'along', 'way', 'finding', 'killer', 'same', 'time', 'never', 'sure', 'who', 'people', 'are', 'can', 'trust', 'them.The', 'cast', 'headed', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'generally', 'very', 'very', 'good', 'Guy', 'why', 'won', 'rave', 'reviews', 'L.A', 'Confidential', 'excellent', 'performance', 'direction', 'pretty', 'slick', 'extremely', 'sly', 'credit', 'must', 'go', 'makers', 'not', 'just', 'thinking', 'up', 'such', 'intelligent', 'story', 'comitting', 'film', 'making', 'work.If', 'downfalls', 'film', 'exist', 'may', 'be', 'little', 'too', 'clever', 'own', 'good', 'lot', 'people', 'have', 'patience', 'concentrate', 'whole', 'movie', 'may', 'find', 'boring', 'hard', 'work', 'not', 'generally', 'what', 'people', 'want', 'entertainment', 'fair', 'expectation', 'know', 'have', 'be', 'certain', 'frame', 'mind', 'watch', 'know', 'many', 'people', 'have', 'switched', 'off', 'halfway', 'aside', 'prepared', 'work', 'film', 'conclusion', 'keep', 'eyes', 'open', 'mind', 'plot', 'then', 'extremely', 'rewarding', 'experience', 'one', 'will', 'have', 'gasping', 'full', 'admiration', 'players', 'involved', 'head', 'full', 'questions', 'answer', 'other', 'possibly', 'watching', 'again', 'sort', 'film', 'watch', 'immediatly', 'want', 'talk', 'anyone', 'else', 'who', 'seen', 'faith', 'sometimes', 'can', 'get', 'intricate', 'story', 'somewhere', 'other', 'book.Sorry', 'clumsy', 'review', 'one', 'movie', 'just', 'have', 'effect']",Memento VHS

The film's opening credits, set over the image of a Polaroid photograph in the reverse process of developing itself, indicates the way the story will unfold--backwards. The cast is filled with first-rate actors, headed by Guy Pearce in a mesmerizing performance as Leonard Shelby--driven, tormented, with a sallow, haunted visage that is maintained throughout the film-who suffers from a rare medical condition which has robbed him of short-term memory. He is on a relentless quest to find and kill the man who attacked and murdered his wife, and who is responsible for Leonard's memory malfunction. The &quot;rub&quot; is that Leonard can't possibly remember the identity of the assailant. Leonard is only able to track him down by the use of Polaroid photos scribbled with reminders, a few odd post-it notes, and, most chillingly, by tattooing clues to his body, including a constant reminder of the reason for his mission, emblazoned backwards across his chest, readable only by use of a mirror. (An aside: &quot;We all need mirrors to remind ourselves who we are&quot;, says Leonard at the end of the film-but the film's question to the audience seems to be: what does that mirror reflect? And can we always believe in the truth of that reflection?) While some may find the vigilante aspect of the main character abhorrent, the audience's empathy for Leonard is gained by the poignancy of his plight. In one heart-wrenching scene, Leonard, while burning some of his wife's belongings, wonders if he has ever similarly disposed of her things before and thinks: &quot;I can't remember to forget you.&quot; &quot;Memento&quot; is an astonishing homily about guilt and vengeance (and is vengeance ever really attainable?), manipulation and betrayal, and the lies we often force ourselves to believe when we fall into our own self-inflicted episodes of short-term memory.

It goes from the end to the beginning, but is that really possible? Is there a plot that can really support that? Well as a matter a fact there is, this movie can actually have that and also let the end (beginning really if you think about it) have a wicked twist. Now I might be confusing you but be confused no more because now let me explain the plot.Memento is about Leonard, he suffers from short term memory loss. Leonard remembers everything up to his wifes murder. Leonard also was attacked during his wife murder (thus the memory loss) He cannot create new memories. So now he is trying to have his revenge with the killer. But how can he accomplish that with his condition? Well...Leonard is very organized, he can take notes and take pictures so he can remember who is who. He takes pictures of all of his contacts. As he goes through his quest he is getting closer and closer he also gets tricked, people can take advantage of someone who wont remember you. He meets a bad cop named Teddy who helps him meet his murder and a bar maid named Natilie.This movie is very suspenseful, this should not be watched by anyone younger than 15, because this movie is very graphic.

I do believe the main character over-stepped his capabilities for somebody with his condition; no amount of organization could allow someone to retain that much information.  The character would have to re-read EVERYTHING to the point where he would have forgotten it well under half-way through.  A real person with this condition actually stopped recognizing himself in the mirror because he had aged beyond the point where he was able to remeber himself.  This movie, and anyone with such a condition, is a living nightmare.  Fortunately, it doesn't appear to be overly emotionally painful for the patient.  For family members, it is obviously very painful.  Eventually, they will not be recognized either once they age sufficiently.

The movie is told in a series of two tales: One, working backward, is the &quot;current&quot; storyline, filmed in color, told in 10-minute increments that jump backward. The second, filmed in b/w, which takes place well before the &quot;current&quot; storyline, is interspersed between each &quot;current&quot; segment, and it runs forward. At the end, both storylines meet.It's brilliant. The characters are fascinating, with constant surprises (who CAN you trust, the movie asks). There's a delicious sense of disorientation caused by the backward movement, because we don't know any more than Leonard does how he got into each new situation. We, the audience, also see that Leonard trusts his intuition and his skills more than he should (he thinks he's a great read of character, but he makes several very key misjudgments; he thinks he's terribly organized, but he doesn't have photos of nearly everybody he should, and he doesn't even carry a pen in one crisis situation to write something down before it's lost), things that are revealed slowly through the backward takes.In the end, the movie is an expose of how unreliable memory is. Leonard's own memories of his pre-trauma days are not reliable, but his belief in them is crucial to his well-being. Even when told a very plausible story of what *really* happened, at the end, the audience realizes, with a pang of loss, that this is the beginning of the &quot;current&quot; storyline and that Leonard will go the rest of the storyline not remembering what he has gone to so much trouble to discover.",5,"Tight, clean, and thought-provoking",1023840000,"06 12, 2002",2002,1747,"['imagine', 'everybody', 'what', 'quot', 'Memento', 'quot', 'now', 'will', 'be', 'brief', 'Leonard', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'make', 'new', 'memories', 'due', 'brain', 'trauma', 'trail', 'wife', 'killer', 'movie', 'told', 'series', 'two', 'tales', 'One', 'working', 'backward', 'quot', 'current', 'quot', 'storyline', 'filmed', 'color', 'told', '10-minute', 'increments', 'jump', 'backward', 'second', 'filmed', 'b/w', 'place', 'well', 'quot', 'current', 'quot', 'storyline', 'interspersed', 'quot', 'current', 'quot', 'segment', 'forward', 'end', 'storylines', 'meet.It', 'brilliant', 'characters', 'are', 'fascinating', 'constant', 'surprises', 'who', 'CAN', 'trust', 'movie', 'delicious', 'sense', 'disorientation', 'caused', 'backward', 'movement', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'more', 'Leonard', 'how', 'got', 'new', 'situation', 'audience', 'also', 'see', 'Leonard', 'intuition', 'skills', 'more', 'should', 'great', 'read', 'character', 'several', 'very', 'key', 'misjudgments', 'terribly', 'organized', ""n't"", 'have', 'photos', 'nearly', 'everybody', 'should', ""n't"", 'even', 'carry', 'pen', 'one', 'crisis', 'situation', 'write', 'something', 'down', 'lost', 'things', 'are', 'revealed', 'slowly', 'backward', 'end', 'movie', 'expose', 'how', 'unreliable', 'memory', 'Leonard', 'own', 'memories', 'pre-trauma', 'days', 'are', 'not', 'reliable', 'belief', 'crucial', 'well-being', 'Even', 'when', 'told', 'very', 'plausible', 'story', 'what', '*really*', 'happened', 'end', 'audience', 'pang', 'loss', 'beginning', 'quot', 'current', 'quot', 'storyline', 'Leonard', 'will', 'go', 'rest', 'storyline', 'not', 'remembering', 'what', 'gone', 'so', 'much', 'trouble', 'discover']",Memento VHS

CRADDOCK ""Cr@$#!!!!""","[0, 0]","Though Memento wasn't Christopher Nolan's very first film, it was his first shot at the big time, as Doodlebug was a 3 minute short and Following was a student film made on a budget of under $6,000. So, you could call Memento a memento of Christopher Nolan's inception as a professional director. It is based on a story that his brother Jonathan wrote about a man who suffers from Anterograde Amnesia--the inability to form new memories after damage to the hippocampus. This character is named Leonard Shelby and he is played by the versatile Australian Actor, Guy Pearce:---------Leonard Shelby: It's just an anonymous room. There's nothing in the drawers. But you look anyway. Nothing except the Gideon bible, which I, of course, read religiously.===============Pearce is really good in this, and though the premise has a built in catch--since he can't remember anything he continuously says the same things and tells the same stories until the people he meets and the audience are both totally fed up--I enjoyed his performance a lot. Leonard is bent on getting revenge on the man who murdered his wife, but his memory problem not only makes this especially difficult--he takes notes, Polaroids, and even has important ""facts"" tattooed on himself in a futile attempt to keep track of it all--it also makes us doubt the veracity of his subjective view of reality. Is he really on track to get revenge, or is he being manipulated by others with their own agendas? And if he does get revenge, how will he enjoy that dish--best served cold--if he can't even remember it being served? And even the memories he does have, the ones formed before the accident, how does he know that they are true?Leonard Shelby--and the other characters, too--are all the ultimate Unreliable Narrators. I first heard the term in conjunction with the novel The Good Soldier by Ford Maddox Ford, but if you watch the director's interview in the DVD bonus material, Nolan uses it to describe Leonard. Such elevated concepts and questioning of the very nature of reality are the hallmarks of Nolan's films. He is a rare director who can both toy with philosophy and a big budget, and still fill the seats. An art house director whose films are blockbusters. Memento, while certainly no blockbuster, was at least successful enough to allow him to keep making films. I have not seen Inception yet, but it seems to be doing very well at the box office, while sporting a convoluted and deep plot that once again questions the nature of reality. Both Memento and Inception remind me in a way of The Matrix, and by the way, the other two supporting cast members--Carrie-Anne Moss and Joe Pantoliano--were both in The Matrix as Trinity and Cypher respectively. They are both feeding Shelby stories that may or may not be true. In Memento, who isn't an Unreliable Narrator?The fun of watching Memento is putting together the pieces of the puzzle. It alternates between flashback scenes, which are in black and white, and color scenes that are present time, moving forward. The chronology of this approach is identical to the way F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote The Great Gatsby with each flashback sequence going further and further back in time until at the end the puzzle of Gatsby's greatness is solved. Now that I think of it, Nick Carraway was also a kind of Unreliable Narrator, because the first thing he says is:In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that I've been turning over in my mind ever since.""Whenever you feel like criticizing any one,"" he told me, ""just remember that all the people in this world haven't had the advantages that you've had.""And Carraway then proceeds to use the rest of the book to harshly judge and criticize just about everyone, advantaged or not.L.A.

541687,A17ZP3VKZ4QRWT,B00003CXZ3,Charlie Brooks,"[2, 2]","Memento is, in many ways, a classic hard-boiled detective film. The hero, Leonard (ably played by Guy Pearce), has no objectivity and is deeply connected to the crime that he is investigated. That crime, the mystery of which dominates the film, is the murder of Leonard's wife. Complicating matters is the fact that Leonard suffered an injury in that same attack that left him a severe impediment: he can't make new memories. As such, he relies on notes to himself and tattoos on his own body that provide clues about the identity of his wife's killer. The audience is as in the dark as Leonard is, because the film is put together in reverse order - beginning with Leonard getting his revenge and then traveling backwards, scene by scene, into a past that Leonard can't remember.Putting the film together in reverse order is a clever tactic that would be nothing more than a gimmick if it wasn't put together so carefuly. What saves the film from being more than just a cinematic trick is some excellent directing and a terrific cast. Guy Pearce is brilliant as the befuddled Leonard, so sure of his path even though he can't remember how he got there. Joe Pantoliano plays his partner of sorts, an ex-cop who hopes to give Leonard some peace of mind but who may actually be the elusive ""John G"" that Leonard is after. Carrie-Anne Moss also plays an excellent role as the film's femme fatale, a woman who helps Leonard but whose motives are as much a mystery as the crime driving the film is. Put together, the cast provides a realistic, grounded performance in a situation that could easily fall into clich&eacute; and dramatic tricks.There are very few flaws in Memento, and none that really detract from the film. This is an excellent movie with a fascinating mystery that unfolds in a unique way. While many films claim to hearken back to hard-boiled detective stories and film noir, Memento does it all and makes it look easy.",5,A detective film with a brilliant twist,1242604800,"05 18, 2009",2009,1932,"['Memento', 'many', 'ways', 'classic', 'hard-boiled', 'detective', 'film', 'hero', 'Leonard', 'ably', 'played', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'objectivity', 'deeply', 'connected', 'crime', 'investigated', 'crime', 'mystery', 'film', 'murder', 'Leonard', 'wife', 'Complicating', 'matters', 'fact', 'Leonard', 'suffered', 'injury', 'same', 'attack', 'left', 'severe', 'impediment', 'ca', ""n't"", 'make', 'new', 'memories', 'such', 'notes', 'tattoos', 'own', 'body', 'provide', 'clues', 'identity', 'wife', 'killer', 'audience', 'dark', 'Leonard', 'film', 'put', 'together', 'reverse', 'order', 'beginning', 'Leonard', 'getting', 'revenge', 'then', 'traveling', 'backwards', 'scene', 'scene', 'past', 'Leonard', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember.Putting', 'film', 'together', 'reverse', 'order', 'clever', 'tactic', 'would', 'be', 'nothing', 'more', 'gimmick', 'was', ""n't"", 'put', 'together', 'so', 'carefuly', 'What', 'film', 'being', 'more', 'just', 'cinematic', 'trick', 'excellent', 'directing', 'terrific', 'cast', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'brilliant', 'befuddled', 'Leonard', 'sure', 'path', 'even', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'how', 'got', 'there', 'Joe', 'Pantoliano', 'partner', 'sorts', 'ex-cop', 'who', 'give', 'Leonard', 'peace', 'mind', 'who', 'may', 'actually', 'be', 'elusive', 'John', 'G', 'Leonard', 'Carrie-Anne', 'Moss', 'also', 'excellent', 'role', 'film', 'femme', 'fatale', 'woman', 'who', 'Leonard', 'motives', 'are', 'as', 'much', 'mystery', 'crime', 'driving', 'film', 'Put', 'together', 'cast', 'realistic', 'grounded', 'performance', 'situation', 'could', 'easily', 'fall', 'clich', 'eacute', 'dramatic', 'tricks.There', 'are', 'very', 'few', 'flaws', 'Memento', 'none', 'really', 'detract', 'film', 'excellent', 'movie', 'fascinating', 'mystery', 'unique', 'way', 'many', 'films', 'claim', 'hearken', 'back', 'hard-boiled', 'detective', 'stories', 'film', 'noir', 'Memento', 'look', 'easy']",Memento VHS

541689,AX8SWWB9837TA,B00003CXZ3,Chris Peters,"[1, 1]","Memento is a story told backwards.  The main character is a man without any short-term memory - he can't remember what he did 10 minutes ago, and everyone is a stranger, no matter what they've done.  Each scene begins with our hero blinking his eyes and trying to figure out where he is and what he is doing. Each moment is a little mystery to him, and to the audience.  A system of notes and tattoos that he has given himself add meaning to his life, as he is in fact pursuing his wife's killer.  Each scene is actually the scene before the last, given in reverse order, and each explains what you saw before while introducing a new mystery.  It all wraps up into a mind-blowing ending, the biggest mystery of them all.It may sound confusing, but it all works, and Memento is fascinating to watch 2, 3 times or more.  Once you've figured out the mystery of who everyone is and what is going on (which can take you a couple of viewings) then you can watch this film just for its wonderful insight into human nature.  The way people change in this story has to be seen to be believed.  This is the absolute best film for peering into the mind of the mentally ill, 'cause for our hero, nothing is wrong except his one weakness, and he tries to compensate for it with intelligence and routine.The DVD is a good (not great) effort, and I recommend the &quot;Special Edition&quot; over this one.  The largest sin is that individual scenes are poorly indexed, so that you can't watch the film &quot;in order&quot; and figure out what happened.  It does include a wonderful short story by the director's brother which I highly recommend you read, as it provides the &quot;backstory&quot; for the character and gives a slightly different but equally fascinating looking into his life.",5,Hold this movie up to a mirror....,1023321600,"06 6, 2002",2002,1776,"['Memento', 'story', 'told', 'backwards', 'main', 'character', 'man', 'short-term', 'memory', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'what', 'did', '10', 'minutes', 'ago', 'everyone', 'stranger', 'matter', 'what', ""'ve"", 'done', 'scene', 'hero', 'blinking', 'eyes', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'where', 'what', 'doing', 'moment', 'little', 'mystery', 'audience', 'system', 'notes', 'tattoos', 'given', 'add', 'meaning', 'life', 'fact', 'pursuing', 'wife', 'killer', 'scene', 'actually', 'scene', 'last', 'given', 'reverse', 'order', 'what', 'saw', 'introducing', 'new', 'mystery', 'up', 'mind-blowing', 'ending', 'biggest', 'mystery', 'all.It', 'may', 'sound', 'confusing', 'works', 'Memento', 'fascinating', 'watch', '2', '3', 'times', 'more', 'Once', ""'ve"", 'figured', 'out', 'mystery', 'who', 'everyone', 'what', 'going', 'can', 'take', 'couple', 'viewings', 'then', 'can', 'watch', 'film', 'just', 'wonderful', 'insight', 'human', 'nature', 'way', 'people', 'change', 'story', 'be', 'seen', 'be', 'believed', 'absolute', 'best', 'film', 'peering', 'mind', 'mentally', 'ill', 'hero', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'one', 'weakness', 'compensate', 'intelligence', 'routine.The', 'DVD', 'good', 'not', 'great', 'effort', 'recommend', 'quot', 'Special', 'Edition', 'quot', 'one', 'largest', 'sin', 'individual', 'scenes', 'are', 'poorly', 'indexed', 'ca', ""n't"", 'watch', 'film', 'quot', 'order', 'quot', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'happened', 'include', 'wonderful', 'short', 'story', 'director', 'brother', 'highly', 'recommend', 'read', 'quot', 'backstory', 'quot', 'character', 'slightly', 'different', 'equally', 'fascinating', 'looking', 'life']",Memento VHS

Musial,"[0, 0]","Many movies that promise to ""keep you guessing on the very end"" or ""keep you on the edge of your seat"" fail to deliver what they advertise. ""Memento"" keeps these promises.The story is told through Leonard, a man who is looking for the killer of his wife. Not a very original story - until his condition is revealed, a condition which has robbed him of his short term memory. The man who killed his wife also stole Leonard's memory as well, and his mission is to find the man who did it. As you may well imagine, this task proves to be exceedingly difficult. But as difficult as the task is for him, the task is even more difficult for the viewer, because the sequences are played in reverse - from the ending to the beginning.This ""backtracking"" is neither annoying or incredibly complicated; rather, it adds to the suspense because nothing is really as it seems. Guy Pierce does an amazing job of playing the helpless Leonard, while Carrie-Anne Moss (you may know her as Trinity from ""The Matrix"") plays her role well as Leonard's twisted informant and lover. Not only that, but there is a powerful message in this movie as to what motivates a man to continue living after he has lost everything.However, the one thing that made ""Memento"" stand out the most was, without a doubt, its unique form of storytelling.

It is one of those movies you can't really figure out until it's over and then you can sit with your friends and put all the pieces together for a few minutes, which I've done every time I show it to one of my friends.I am surprised that not many people have even heard of this movie. I remember when my cousin asked me if I'd seen it and I had no clue. Then I finally watched it and I was very impressed. I think I watched it again the next day. Then two days later...I'm trying to do my part to get this great movie known, because just about everyone I ask has never seen it.These days there are so few options for plots that it makes making a good movie difficult. (Ideas are just getting ridiculous). But they were on to something when they conceived this one. I just loved how after the first scene he shoots the dude and immediately you think, ""well he must be the bad guy"", and you think that for the whole movie...but...is he?If you like movies that are hard to predict and keep you thinking right up to the end, here's your movie.

But at the same time you can join the story at any given point and it would still leave you with lots of questions of what happened before, what happened after and what is the actual TRUTH.

It's one of the most complex films to come out in recent memory and it loses?(I think it lost to Almost Famous, which was equally good). Anyway enough griping, this was innovative. A movie that starts you off with the last chronological event and working backwards. So imagine having Sleep, Dinner, School, Lunch, School, Breakfast in that order and you get the picture.Leonard Shelby is tracking down his wife's murderer and rapist.  He fought with the assailant only to have his brain screwed with. See, he can remember everything up until the accident but everything afterwards disappears, like if he were to shower, 10 minutes later he'd literally forget he took one.  So to help him out, he takes pictures of places and pictures with notes in order to keep track of who's who and who to trust.It got quite a lot of attention due to the rather unorthodox way of showing a film(final scene first, first scene last in a time aspect), and also its twist at the end. Once it unfolds towards the end, you really see how the rest of the film came together...if you can remember it.  Problem with this kind of way of showing and also its benefit is that sometimes you forget how Leonard got to a particular place or why he was there, making the benefit of repeated viewings.If you wanna work your brain for a change, instead of the &quot;jerking off the ego&quot; movies that have come out recently, give this one a watch.",5,The most complex film you'll see,1072483200,"12 27, 2003",2003,1474,"['Why', 'oh', 'why', 'did', 'NOT', 'win', 'best', 'Original', 'Screenplay', 'one', 'most', 'complex', 'films', 'come', 'out', 'recent', 'memory', 'think', 'lost', 'Almost', 'Famous', 'was', 'equally', 'good', 'Anyway', 'enough', 'griping', 'was', 'innovative', 'movie', 'off', 'last', 'chronological', 'event', 'working', 'backwards', 'So', 'imagine', 'having', 'Sleep', 'Dinner', 'School', 'Lunch', 'School', 'Breakfast', 'order', 'get', 'picture.Leonard', 'Shelby', 'tracking', 'down', 'wife', 'murderer', 'rapist', 'fought', 'assailant', 'only', 'have', 'brain', 'screwed', 'See', 'can', 'remember', 'everything', 'up', 'accident', 'everything', 'afterwards', 'were', 'shower', '10', 'minutes', 'later', ""'d"", 'literally', 'forget', 'took', 'one', 'So', 'help', 'out', 'pictures', 'places', 'pictures', 'notes', 'order', 'keep', 'track', 'who', 'who', 'who', 'trust.It', 'got', 'quite', 'lot', 'attention', 'due', 'rather', 'unorthodox', 'way', 'showing', 'film', 'final', 'scene', 'first', 'first', 'scene', 'last', 'time', 'aspect', 'also', 'twist', 'end', 'end', 'really', 'see', 'how', 'rest', 'film', 'came', 'together', 'can', 'remember', 'Problem', 'kind', 'way', 'showing', 'also', 'benefit', 'sometimes', 'forget', 'how', 'Leonard', 'got', 'particular', 'place', 'why', 'was', 'there', 'making', 'benefit', 'repeated', 'viewings.If', 'wan', 'na', 'work', 'brain', 'change', 'instead', 'quot', 'jerking', 'off', 'ego', 'quot', 'movies', 'have', 'come', 'out', 'recently', 'give', 'one', 'watch']",Memento VHS

Middleton,"[6, 8]","To put it precisely as possible, ~Memento~ is a smart film.Taken from a short story written by his brother, Christopher Nolan crafted a screenplay and created a film that absolutely requires his viewers to engage and contemplate the story. No passive viewing allowed in this film. ~Memento~ requires full attention and engagement, otherwise there's no point.The story concerns a poor soul by the name of Leonard Shelby, (Guy Pearce) who has contracted an untenable form of memory loss, due to an extremly violent attack, also leaving his wife dead. The problem with this form of amnesia, is that it is on going: Shelby knows who he is but cannot remember anything else fifteen minutes in the past. He cannot create new memories. Rather than sit in front of the television feeling sorry for himself and watching re-runs of 'Friends', (which, in a way, is another form of amnesia) the man is on an obsessed mission to find his wife's killer.What would you do in the same position? Shelby's trade-off on actual memory is a brilliant system combining hand written notes, photos with relevant captions; and the real important memories, those of the 'etched' variety, he has made into tattoos. When he wakes up in the morning, it's back to his notes, re-orienting himself to why, what and where he is - this is an existential battle of the highest order, a perpetual war to remain in present time. What I find even more frightening: whom could you trust? These are the film's themes taken to the insane edges of possibility.Guy Pearce's performance as the empty headed avenger is nothing less than brilliant. Throughout the film, he continued to repeat a subtle gesture - reaching behind his neck under his jacket and adjusting his shirt. The reason for this quirky mannerism is revealed at the end of the film. I mention this to illustrate Pearce's meticulousness as an actor. According to sources, his research as an actor is impeccable, focusing on the finer details of his character. Which begs the question: why not a nomination for best actor? This performance easily ranks in the top five for 2001-2. I believe the Academy has a similar condition to Leonard Shelby: any film released before June 2001 was forgotten and never got a mention. And that's a shame.The London born director and writer has been dubbed ""norish"", ""meta-noir"" and ""cerebral"".

541699,A3J5UO5QMTFSWB,B00003CXZ3,"Connoisseur Rat ""armchair experientialist""","[11, 12]","Having recently seen and enjoyed ""The Lookout"", another film which features a character trying to piece together his life after a traumatic head injury leaves him memory-challenged, I was inspired to go back and see its cinematic sire of sorts - the now-classic mindwarp that is Memento.  And though I bought this DVD when it was released and had watched it twice (which is the minimum number of recommended viewings for this film), it's just collected dust for five years and I hadn't returned to it since.Aptly enough, I had forgotten much of it, making much of Memento seem newly fresh yet oddly familiar, much like most of its main character Leonard's daily doings.  Leonard, as we pretty much all know by now, is trying to get revenge for the killing of his wife, which is made somewhat more challenging (to say the least) by the fact that he suffers from extreme short-term memory loss and can't remember any more than ten minutes at a time.  As Leonard himself will tell almost anyone he meets: ""I can't make new memories - everything fades.""All of which would in itself make for an interesting movie.  But what makes this film truly ingenious is the way it is constructed and edited.  You know, one of my dearly-departed favorite author Kurt Vonnegut's Eight Rules for Writing Fiction is: ""start as close to the end as possible.""  Well, Memento takes this rule - written by one of the ultimate storytellers - and pushes it to its extreme, actually starting AT the end and then working backwards - which makes for one of the all-time greatest stories.Now, a lot of movies that are assembled in this kind of non-linear time-jumpy kind of way are gimmicky to a fault, and confusing for no good reason.  But in Memento, this style of editing actually serves the story and makes it better, because - by showing us Leonard's perpetually-perplexing world out of sequence - it forces us to experience the movie in the same disoriented way that Leonard experiences the world.  So as Leonard puzzles his way through his life, so do we.  This makes us empathize and connect with the film's central character in a way few other movies have ever been able to achieve before or since (whichever way you happen to travel through time in your search).  Of course, the fact the Guy Pearce's performance is so riveting helps us enormously with our empathy as well.Anyway, there are about a thousand (or so) other reviews here that will tell you more about what happens in the movie, but I think that this story - more than most - relies on the surprise that each new/past detail reveals, so I don't want to ruin any of this film's revelations if you are lucky enough to be contemplating seeing this movie for the first time.And if you are considering watching this picture for the first time (or even if you've already seen it), I would definitely encourage you to buy this DVD.  Because the great thing about owning a movie like Memento, as my experience will attest, is that it rewards multiple viewings.  And the depth and the detail (in addition to the design) of the film ensure that each viewing is made fresh with new insight and understanding.In the end, Memento is so much more than just a non-linear, well-crafted crime thriller.  It's also an exploration of what makes up a person's identity, and an examination of the malleability of experience.  Ultimately, Memento shows us how all our memories are fallible, and - to some degree - we all have to use devices like Leonard uses to remember things: whether it's jotting down phone numbers, taking pictures on our vacations, or (in my case just now) watching a DVD to remind you of all the things you loved about a movie in the first place.",5,Memento: The Freshmaker!,1176508800,"04 14, 2007",2007,3691,"['Having', 'recently', 'seen', 'enjoyed', 'Lookout', 'film', 'character', 'trying', 'piece', 'together', 'life', 'traumatic', 'head', 'injury', 'memory-challenged', 'was', 'inspired', 'go', 'back', 'see', 'cinematic', 'sire', 'sorts', 'now-classic', 'mindwarp', 'Memento', 'bought', 'DVD', 'when', 'was', 'released', 'had', 'watched', 'twice', 'minimum', 'number', 'recommended', 'viewings', 'film', 'just', 'collected', 'dust', 'five', 'years', 'had', ""n't"", 'returned', 'since.Aptly', 'enough', 'had', 'forgotten', 'much', 'making', 'much', 'Memento', 'seem', 'newly', 'fresh', 'yet', 'oddly', 'familiar', 'much', 'most', 'main', 'character', 'Leonard', 'daily', 'doings', 'Leonard', 'pretty', 'much', 'know', 'now', 'trying', 'get', 'revenge', 'killing', 'wife', 'made', 'somewhat', 'more', 'challenging', 'say', 'least', 'fact', 'extreme', 'short-term', 'memory', 'loss', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'more', 'ten', 'minutes', 'time', 'Leonard', 'will', 'tell', 'almost', 'anyone', 'ca', ""n't"", 'make', 'new', 'memories', 'everything', 'fades', 'would', 'make', 'interesting', 'movie', 'what', 'film', 'truly', 'ingenious', 'way', 'constructed', 'edited', 'know', 'one', 'dearly-departed', 'favorite', 'author', 'Kurt', 'Vonnegut', 'Eight', 'Rules', 'Writing', 'Fiction', 'start', 'close', 'end', 'possible', 'Well', 'Memento', 'rule', 'written', 'one', 'ultimate', 'storytellers', 'extreme', 'actually', 'starting', 'AT', 'end', 'then', 'working', 'backwards', 'one', 'all-time', 'greatest', 'stories.Now', 'lot', 'movies', 'are', 'assembled', 'kind', 'non-linear', 'time-jumpy', 'kind', 'way', 'are', 'gimmicky', 'fault', 'confusing', 'good', 'reason', 'Memento', 'style', 'editing', 'actually', 'story', 'better', 'showing', 'Leonard', 'perpetually-perplexing', 'world', 'sequence', 'experience', 'movie', 'same', 'disoriented', 'way', 'Leonard', 'world', 'Leonard', 'way', 'life', 'so', 'do', 'empathize', 'connect', 'film', 'central', 'character', 'way', 'few', 'other', 'movies', 'have', 'ever', 'been', 'able', 'achieve', 'whichever', 'way', 'happen', 'travel', 'time', 'search', 'course', 'fact', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'performance', 'so', 'riveting', 'enormously', 'empathy', 'well.Anyway', 'are', 'thousand', 'so', 'other', 'reviews', 'here', 'will', 'tell', 'more', 'what', 'movie', 'think', 'story', 'more', 'most', 'relies', 'surprise', 'new/past', 'detail', 'reveals', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'ruin', 'film', 'revelations', 'are', 'lucky', 'enough', 'be', 'contemplating', 'seeing', 'movie', 'first', 'time.And', 'are', 'considering', 'watching', 'picture', 'first', 'time', 'even', ""'ve"", 'already', 'seen', 'would', 'definitely', 'encourage', 'buy', 'DVD', 'great', 'thing', 'owning', 'movie', 'Memento', 'experience', 'will', 'attest', 'multiple', 'viewings', 'depth', 'detail', 'addition', 'design', 'film', 'ensure', 'viewing', 'made', 'fresh', 'new', 'insight', 'understanding.In', 'end', 'Memento', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'just', 'non-linear', 'well-crafted', 'crime', 'thriller', 'also', 'exploration', 'what', 'up', 'person', 'identity', 'examination', 'malleability', 'experience', 'Ultimately', 'Memento', 'how', 'memories', 'are', 'fallible', 'degree', 'have', 'use', 'devices', 'Leonard', 'remember', 'things', 'jotting', 'down', 'phone', 'numbers', 'taking', 'pictures', 'vacations', 'case', 'just', 'now', 'watching', 'DVD', 'remind', 'things', 'loved', 'movie', 'first', 'place']",Memento VHS
541700,A1T3O2LILVK0C4,B00003CXZ3,"Count Orlok '22 "":(""","[2, 2]","With his second feature film, director Christopher Nolan (Following) created a stunning thriller. Not only is Memento an incredible accomplishment as a film, but also an impressive feat for a relatively new filmmaker. The film's screenplay, which was written by Nolan and was inspired by his brother Jonathan's short story, is nothing short of brilliant. The story taps the best ideas from both classic noir and detective films of the late 1940s, as well as more contemporary psychological suspense films, and the result is a film, which is in essence a neo-noir/thriller. Skillfully, Christopher Nolan avoids the all-too-familiar pitfalls of the two genres while acknowledging their inherent strengths. Rich in atmosphere and character, Memento is a modern classic and a prime example of using an intricate narrative to heighten a story's impact.Ever since his wife was assaulted, Leonard Shelby (marvelously portrayed by Guy Pearce) has suffered from a rare disorder. His mind is incapable of creating new memories, so everything he has experienced since the attack he forgets in a matter of minutes. Left with little to live for, Leonard vows that he will avenge his wife... but this proves to be difficult without his short-term memory. Leonard relies on mementos (lists, notes, photographs, and even tattoos) to aid him in his search for the killer, but he is also forced to trust strangers. Among those that he confides in are Teddy (played by Joe Pantoliano, with an irritating smirk) a sarcastic snitch with connections on both sides of the law and Natalie (played by Carrie-Anne Moss, who straddles the line between sympathetic victim and sadistic seductress), the girlfriend of a missing drug dealer. As Leonard follows the clues it becomes apparent that the people he surround himself with are not what he perceived them to be. They are either exploiting his disability for their own gain or manipulating him to keep him from the shocking truth about his wife's death and the identity of her killer. Leonard realizes that he can trust no one, not even himself.When Memento was released, it was hailed as a visionary piece of filmmaking and it's clear that the greatest star of the film is its story, which unfolds in a series of segments shown in reversed chronological order. This method, which might have spoiled the ending in any other film, is miraculous in that it places the story's climax in the beginning of the film and then allows the audience to see what events lead up to that final act. In recent years many filmmakers have played with viewers' expectations and intentionally subverted those expectations, leading to mixed results. Often filmmakers that embrace such an unorthodox narrative to tell a story do so to individualize their films, but if their films had were to be edited into a more typical narrative structure, then they would lose their originality. Not so with Memento. Its narrative isn't just a manipulative gimmick to keep audiences interested. The story almost requires this dyslexic treatment so that viewers will gain greater insight into the protagonist's dilemma. Another unique aspect is its psychological inner workings, which suggests many things about the nature of corruption and revenge. If one were capable of forgetting their past transgressions, are they then purified by their ignorance of those transgressions or are they forever condemned to suffer the consequences of their actions... again... and again... and again?

Possessed of the sort of evocative plot that guarantees that I will be there on opening day, it thrilled me just reading the synopsis, never mind that rush after leaving the theatre that comes from being completely in thrall. It is beyond doubt, one of the most startling concepts ever put to film. And its not only the plot itself, but the way in which it is told, that makes this a classic. I LOVE when i meet people who have never seen this film, and scratch my head when i meet the occasional person who didn't enjoy it. Inevitably, its the action-movie types who want to be able to run to the concession or make up another batch of chicken wings and come back and still be able to hang onto the plot who wound up disappointed. It demands an absolute attention that many moviegoers will find exhausting, but for me, its why films are made. God, just watching it (which I have, many, many times) still gives me a thrill.

541702,A26BWRBPP4V2WF,B00003CXZ3,Craig MACKINNON,"[6, 9]","As most reviews mention, this film basically runs backwards - it's divided into 5-15 minute scenes, each scene ending where the previous scene started.  We meet the hero of the film, Leonard (Guy Pearce, in another great acting job) just as he has murdered a man named Teddy.  So we know what happened (Teddy is murdered), but we don't know why.  It turns out Leonard has brain damage and cannot make new long-term memories.  He can, however, condition himself (in a classical, Pavlovian sense), and so he writes notes to himself, takes pictures, and prints tatoos on his body to keep his life and quest straight.  The quest? - finding and killing the man who murdered his wife.  The first scene implies that Teddy must have been the murderer.  But is he, or is Leonard being set up by someone and can't remember it?  This is the crux of the question that is answered as we learn how Teddy came to be murdered.The gimmick - playing scenes in reverse order (but the scenes themselves play forward) - is essential for the enjoyment of the film.  First, it puts us squarely in the shoes of the protagonist, who always knows what he's doing, but doesn't really know why.  There are many visual clues - scratches on his face (how did they get there?), a picture of a man he's beaten up, a cryptic message on the photo of Teddy - ""Don't believe his lies.""  Second, the story is too straightforward to view in forward order - watching it in order would be no more interesting than a typical episode of Law and Order (much like viewing Pulp Fiction in chronological order).At this point, I should mention that the film has an unfair reputation of being difficult to follow and of being violent.  The most violent scene is, in fact, the opening credits, which are more violent by a long shot than the rest of the film.  Similarly, the film is not difficult to follow.  Sure, you may not be able to piece together every little detail (the same can be said for most good Film Noir) with just one viewing, but the answer to the question of the first scene - ""why was Teddy killed and did he deserve to be"" - is obviously resolved.There are two main problems with this DVD edition.  One is with the film: Leonard's memory problem seems to vary with the needs of the plot.  At times he can hold things in his head for a long time, at other times he forgets in the middle of doing something (for example, at one point he is in the process of running and can't remember why, but at another point he manages to gather up a bunch of items, drive to a deserted lot, and burn them, which must have taken quite some time).  This is something you only think about anfterwards, though, so it does not detract from the film.  The second problem, for which I deducted a star (it's really a 4-star film) is the fact that this particular DVD edition is extremely bare-bones.  There is a special edition of Memento, which would be the recommended format for repeated viewings.All-in-all, though, this is a very enjoyable movie.  It's the type of film that many people will want to own and watch repeatedly to understand all the little nuances of the plot.  That's not to say that the film doesn't hold up to a single viewing - it's very interesting and intriguing, mostly because of the manner in which the film is constructed, but also due to the actors, who do a good job throughout.",3,"Style trumps substance, but it's a better film because of it",1115078400,"05 3, 2005",2005,3357,"['most', 'reviews', 'mention', 'film', 'basically', 'backwards', 'divided', '5-15', 'minute', 'scenes', 'scene', 'ending', 'where', 'previous', 'scene', 'started', 'meet', 'hero', 'film', 'Leonard', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'great', 'acting', 'job', 'just', 'murdered', 'man', 'named', 'Teddy', 'know', 'what', 'happened', 'Teddy', 'murdered', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'out', 'Leonard', 'brain', 'damage', 'can', 'not', 'make', 'new', 'long-term', 'memories', 'can', 'however', 'condition', 'classical', 'Pavlovian', 'sense', 'so', 'notes', 'pictures', 'prints', 'tatoos', 'body', 'keep', 'life', 'quest', 'straight', 'quest', 'finding', 'killing', 'man', 'who', 'murdered', 'wife', 'first', 'scene', 'implies', 'Teddy', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'murderer', 'Leonard', 'being', 'set', 'up', 'someone', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'crux', 'question', 'answered', 'learn', 'how', 'Teddy', 'came', 'be', 'murdered.The', 'gimmick', 'playing', 'scenes', 'reverse', 'order', 'scenes', 'play', 'forward', 'essential', 'enjoyment', 'film', 'First', 'squarely', 'shoes', 'protagonist', 'who', 'always', 'what', 'doing', ""n't"", 'really', 'know', 'why', 'are', 'many', 'visual', 'clues', 'scratches', 'face', 'how', 'did', 'get', 'there', 'picture', 'man', 'beaten', 'up', 'cryptic', 'message', 'photo', 'Teddy', 'Do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'lies', 'Second', 'story', 'too', 'straightforward', 'view', 'forward', 'order', 'watching', 'order', 'would', 'be', 'no', 'more', 'interesting', 'typical', 'episode', 'Law', 'Order', 'much', 'viewing', 'Pulp', 'Fiction', 'chronological', 'order', 'point', 'should', 'mention', 'film', 'unfair', 'reputation', 'being', 'difficult', 'follow', 'being', 'violent', 'most', 'violent', 'scene', 'fact', 'opening', 'credits', 'are', 'more', 'violent', 'long', 'shot', 'rest', 'film', 'Similarly', 'film', 'not', 'difficult', 'follow', 'Sure', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'able', 'piece', 'together', 'little', 'detail', 'same', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'most', 'good', 'Film', 'Noir', 'just', 'one', 'viewing', 'answer', 'question', 'first', 'scene', 'why', 'was', 'Teddy', 'killed', 'did', 'deserve', 'be', 'obviously', 'are', 'two', 'main', 'problems', 'DVD', 'edition', 'One', 'film', 'Leonard', 'memory', 'problem', 'vary', 'needs', 'plot', 'times', 'can', 'hold', 'things', 'head', 'long', 'time', 'other', 'times', 'middle', 'doing', 'something', 'example', 'one', 'point', 'process', 'running', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'why', 'point', 'gather', 'up', 'bunch', 'items', 'drive', 'deserted', 'lot', 'burn', 'must', 'have', 'taken', 'quite', 'time', 'something', 'only', 'think', 'anfterwards', 'though', 'not', 'detract', 'film', 'second', 'problem', 'deducted', 'star', 'really', '4-star', 'film', 'fact', 'particular', 'DVD', 'edition', 'extremely', 'bare-bones', 'special', 'edition', 'Memento', 'would', 'be', 'recommended', 'format', 'repeated', 'viewings.All-in-all', 'though', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'type', 'film', 'many', 'people', 'will', 'want', 'own', 'watch', 'repeatedly', 'understand', 'little', 'nuances', 'plot', 'not', 'say', 'film', ""n't"", 'hold', 'up', 'single', 'viewing', 'very', 'interesting', 'intriguing', 'mostly', 'manner', 'film', 'constructed', 'also', 'due', 'actors', 'who', 'do', 'good', 'job']",Memento VHS

Director/Writer Nolan is doing much more than telling a tale in an innovative fashion.  He is making statements about reality and human experience whether he intended to or not.The narrative loop in the film, far more than a gimmick, unseats us from the comfortable theater seat and makes us sit up an take notice.  By the end of the film, we have (hopefully!) figured out what exactly is going on to Leonard/Lenny.  It's a shame he has no clue -- or does he?I've always thought Guy Pearce was a great actor, and this is easily his best work to date (with LA Confidential a close second).  Joe Pantoliano and Carrie Ann Moss are brilliant in the supporting cast.  I just wish this film had garnered more acclaim than it did.Unfortunately I haven't found any of Nolan's work since to be all that memorable, but he has proven himself to be both insightful and capable of crafting a stunning piece of ground-breaking cinema.One wish for the DVD -- on Nolan's &quot;Following&quot; we had the option of watching the film &quot;in order.&quot;  I really wanted that option here.

The film is distinguished by powerhouse storytelling, snappy editing, and great acting.  The basic story concerns Leonard(Guy Pearce) a man suffering from short-term memory loss who is attempting to unravel the mystery of his wife's murder.  Leonard's efforts include a network of body tattoos, Polaroid pictures, and handwritten notes he leaves for himself.  As Leonard attempts to piece together the mystery the question arises as to the reliability of these reminders.  Leonard's condition also subjects him to the exploitation from some malevolent forces.

Told in reverse, the film follows Leonard (Guy Pearce) as he tries to find the man who raped and murdered his wife. There's just one snag: Leonard suffered a brain injury while trying to protect his wife that fateful evening. He can no longer make new memories, only able to recall his life before the event, everything else fading away within minutes. He wakes every morning still expecting to see his wife, never remembering who to trust and who to fear. Relying on Polaroids and tattoos to keep track of clues he drifts on, forever looking for a man who may be a lot closer then he thinks. From this premise, writer/director Nolan weaves a perfectly crafted tale which unravels itself slowly and methodically through flashbacks. We, like Leonard, are completely lost. By starting at the 'end' of the film, we gather more and more information as the story is presented, a chunk at a time, until the shocking finish, which makes the preceding 110 minutes all the more devastating. 'Memento' is a perfectly executed film, full of wonderful montages and unpredictable twists and turns. The cast shines. Carrie-Anne Moss and Joe Pantoliano are by turns sympathetic and heart-breaking and Pearce has never been better. There are few films out there that truly attempt at reinventing a genre and even less that succeed. This is one of those films and it is not to be missed.

541716,A2B21POKQ3N09H,B00003CXZ3,David J. Gannon,"[6, 7]","This is one movie where it pays to pay close attention.  The movie runs backwards.  It starts with the camera focused on a Polaroid instant picture developing-and showing a man who has just had his brains blown out.  The movie proceeds to explain how things got to this point through a series of backward looking sequences that develop the plot in reverse.Guy Pearce plays Leonard Shelby, hunting down the man who raped and murdered his wife. The problem is that ""the incident"" that robbed Leonard of his wife also stole his ability to make new memories. Unable to retain a location, a face, or a new clue on his own, Leonard continues his search with the help of notes, Polaroid's, and even homemade tattoos for vital information.  Pearce does an exemplary job of projecting he ""condition"" he suffers from and the director provides ample illustrations of how others can exploit his condition.The suspense of the movie lies not in discovering what happens, but in finding out why it happened, as well as in trying to figure out which of the cast of eccentric and volatile characters are aiding, exploiting or hindering Lenny as he proceeds with his mission.The acting is uniformly impressive.  This represents one of the best-and best used-ensemble casts I've seen in a long, long time.The movie moves along at a torrid pace even though there really isn't all that much action.  This is a cerebral thriller. If your idea of a great movie is special effects, bodies, car chases and gun play, is not your flick.For a movie like this to succeed the editing must be first rate-the jarring backward thrust of the sequences is distracting enough in itself, so the other aspects of continuity that editing can provide must be present consistently.  The editing and direction, for that matter, are both first rate.  The editing also contains the clues that provide the answers to what's really going on.

541717,A2BZWG2LTJZGBQ,B00003CXZ3,David M. Lovin,"[0, 1]","Let's see, how to begin this review-- how about at the end and move slowly toward the front?  You see, that would be a propos for this film, which takes precisely that approach to tell the story.  It moves from end to beginning, with each scene that the audience sees being the scene which took place before the previous scene.Well, kind of.  There is also another similar plot line which runs in true time and is mostly the main character, Leonard (Guy Pearce) talking to someone on the phone about a strange mental condition.  No worries about telling the two plot lines apart, because this alternate plot line is shot completely in black and white, while the plot line that runs in reverse is done in color.  The movie alternates black and white scenes with color scenes, which leaves us completely confused for a while.Not really such a bad thing for this movie, because that's exactly what Leonard feels.  He was a detective living a normal life, when his wife was brutally raped and murdered.  He walked in on the attack and was slammed into a wall.  He developed a strange condition from this injury.  He can form no new memories.  Anything that happened to him before the attack is crystal clear.  Since then, any encounter he has fades from memory within seconds.To combat this, he uses his body as a kind of billboard, tatooing various facts about the killer all over himself, so he won't forget them as he hunts down the killer of his wife.  He also keeps pictures of everyone he meets and writes notes on the backs to keep straight whether they can be trusted.  Some of the people he meets may not be his true friends, but we don't know that, we are along for the ride.The two main characters Leonard meets in the movie are Teddy (Joe Pantoliano) and Natalie (Carrie Anne Moss).  Both characters are not who they seem at first, and one wonders if either can truly be trusted.  Kudos must go out to Pearce, who gives an excellent performance as the brain damaged Leonard.  You can sense his acceptance of the reality of his life, yet see the despair just underneath the surface.  Magnificent performance.Camera work is another plus here.  A couple of neat tricks for us.  The opening scene is of someone being shot with a pistol.  The scene goes completely in reverse, with the bullet going back into the gun and the blood crawling  up the wall.  This sets the scene for the type of storytelling we will be seeing.  Also, I mentioned the two separate storylines.  Watch toward the very end for these to come together.  It will take a careful eye to spot the moment when they do.The main accomplishment for Christopher Nolan is the ability to structure the film in this way and still leave us a surprise at the end.  Or beginning.  Whatever.  By the time the credits roll, we learn that everything that has gone before may not be completely accurate.  Is that the message?  That memory itself is unreliable?  Perhaps.Finally, the DVD itself.  Wonderful.  The image is crisp and clear.  The DTS sound is awesome  The discs are loaded with extras although I admit they are a pain to access, particularly disc 2.  You may have to go to a website to fully explain how to access everything.  My favorite feature is the one which lets you watch the whole movie in real time  The black and white scenes all actually happen before the color scenes in real time.  This is evident when you utilize this feature.In short, this is a must see.  I promise, you will not see anything like this for a long time.  The script, acting, and execution are near flawless.

541718,A35WRDXBBBRZW9,B00003CXZ3,D. Bartell,"[1, 1]","""Memento"" is the kind of movie you are really going to like or not.  The story is a whodunit thriller with some intriguing, if not confusing, twists.  I liked the movie.  However, upon exiting the theater, I saw a lot of head shaking and some displeased facial expressions.  As well as, a few people whispering "" I just don't get it......"".Well folks, this is just the kind of movie a lot of people will debate, argue, critique, and talk about, and in the end, agree to disagree.  It's not for the light of heart who are looking for a romantic comedy with a very predicable ending.  It's also not a great cinematographic wonder, or a gun shooting, let's see what we can blow up in every frame, type of action movie.  This movie involves paying attention and putting all the pieces together.In the opening credits you see a Polaroid of a murdered man that fades away, and then, the movie begins. Of course, the movie starts at the actual end of the story, yes......,  it's told in reverse.  It moves backward, scene by scene,  each scene overlapping the other slightly, just in case you missed something.  The story also has a few extra flashbacks thrown in to confuse us more.  But, these flashbacks are very important and pertinent to identifying with the main character.This isn't used too often in moviemaking.  It does force one to pay attention though.  It makes the movie patron think,  mentally work a little, and then form your own conclusion about the film's ""message"". The director's vehicle of delivery to the audience was done on purpose, no doubt.The ending  is appropriate for such a convoluted twist of events.  It's well worth waiting for and your glad you finally got there.  It feels like you've been on a very thrilling ride but your ready to get off now, thank you very much.

On the other hand though, I wasn't satisfied with the ending and I felt a bit cheated at having been taken for this ride that ultimately went nowhere.This is a very well made, very creatively made movie.  It holds your interest throughout, and it twists your mind in every which direction.  This is achieved by showing you 5 or 10 minute snippets of the action in reverse order.  Yes, it begins at the end and ends at the beginning of a very strange day for our hero, which we find out is a fairly normal day for him.  The acting is very convincing and the story will keep you guessing up to the very end.On the other hand, as I did, you might be able to figure out what is going on about halfway through if you pay careful enough attention.  I won't give it away, but ever since The Sixth Sense came out, directors and screenwriters have been jumping all over each other to come up with a twist ending to top everyone else's, and if you think about it they are all just giving you a slightly different angle on the same twist.  It was an engaging watch, but you have to ask yourself if it would still be as engaging had it been shown in the proper order?  I realize that it was the intention all along to make the film this way and I do think it is innovative and thought-provoking, but is that the only reason that it is?  Something to think about...I can't tell my real gripe about this movie without spoiling it for those who have not seen it, and I will not do that.

However, if you revel in strange realities present with artsy cinematography, then Memento may be for you.  Leonard (Guy Pearce) has a ""condition"" that prevents him from creating new memories, and thus he is stuck only with the person he was before his wife's brutal death.  Now, he wakes up every few minutes to a new life organized only by Polaroid pictures, notes scribbled to himself, and a maze of tattoos scrawled over his body.  Leonard believes in facts, not memories, although the viewer soon discovers just how tenuous the relationship between fact and fiction really is.Although the film begins at what is essentially the end, the progression is as chronologically complex as Leonard's own fractured sense of time.  The vignettes, with scenes repeated and extended, gradually build on one another to give the viewer a fuller sense of what is really happening.  In this way, the characters are plastic, changing according to Leonard's latest understanding of them and then vanishing from his consciousness.  There's Teddy (Joe Pantoliano) and Natalie (Carrie-Ann Moss), two people who seem both friendly and malicious. Like Leonard, we have to learn anew about them in every scene.  These puzzling glimpses begin to assemble into something larger than even Leonard is willing to admit.While Memento falls into the postmodern realm of filmmaking, with its use of alternate realities and means of communication, it is not as riveting asFight Club (Widescreen Edition)nor as humorously self-referential asAdaptation (Superbit Collection).

On one level, this film is a simple crime thriller.  Guy Pearce plays the disabled Leonard who is searching for his wife's killer despite being hampered by the inablity to make any new memories.  Though the mystery element of the plot is compelling, the true force of the movie comes from its ablity to let you experience a series of events from Leonard's perspective.  The movie runs backwards in ten minute clips that mirror the increadibly short period of time in which Leonard can maintain linear awareness.  You watch as Leonard is thrust into a situation and, along with Leonard, you have no idea how he got there.  It is only after the scene has run its course and the movie skips to the next sequence that you are finally given the answer.  However, every answer you are granted unearths three times as many new questions, and you find your attention rapt and unrelenting as you wait for the appearance of Leonard's next random adventure.This movie is as compelling as any that have been released in recent memory.  Like &quot;Pulp Fiction,&quot; the events of the film are not presented linearly, thus making the editing a major factor in the effect of the film.  The structure is increadibly unique and well crafted.  The movie starts at the chronological end and moves backwards in jumps which are separated by black and white segments that take place in the distant past.  The narrative lines run towards each other and eventually connect using the very clever device of watching a polaroid picture develop (thus providing the bridge from black and white to color).Guy Pearce gives a tremendous performance.  If he got your attention in L.A. Confidential, he's proved himself to be a formidable actor here, much like Brad Pitt's career defining performance in &quot;Seven.&quot;  But really there is not much more I can say, the whole supporting cast is superb, the script is well above average and the direction and film construction is magnificent.

After watching the DVD, i'm glad that it was well worth it. It's one of the best films made.The storytelling is undoubtledly one of a kind. the movie actually starts at the end, where Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce) successfully finds his wife's killer and executes him. No spoiler here i guess. Then the movie moves backwards about 10 minutes at a time leading to the events happening previously.In between these 10 minute reversals are black and white segments that actually move forward. these black and white segments more or less kinda introduces the character and his illness bit by bit so that the viewer can make sense of what is happening to the character as each of the 10 minute segments are being played in reverse.as the black and white segments move forward, and the normal segments moves backwards, they converge into the climax of the movie.The Memento LE DVD set is a definite collector's item. it has a lot of features that you'll really appreciate. A special feature on this DVD is on the second disk where you can veiw the Original short story and an easter egg where you can actually view the movie in its chronological order! Also, the director's commentary is a useful feature that lets you in on insights into the making of - and the meaning of - Memento.The DVD's navigation system can be a bit tricky for some users. upon opening the dvd, a series of words flashes by, and you are required to remember those words to navigate the main menu, which is a test of text retention. Actually you don't have to remember a thing since the correct answers are the only ones you can select. Disc 2 is the same but instead of word, it flashed a series of images. no memorization here actually. This can be a challenging and rewarding exercise letting you fully interact with the viewing process. This exercise can actually become frustrating. Because once you've cracked the puzzles on disc 2, this feature becomes inconvenient and irritating whenever you want to access the features again. That's basically why i gave this 4 stars instead of 5For the technical aspects of this DVD, the sound quality is great. This edition has a DTS 5.1 track on top of the Dolby 5.1 surround track.

541727,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,B00003CXZ3,Dennis Littrell,"[8, 9]","I have seen a lot of movies and almost always I know what the director is doing.  I know what the actors want to achieve.  I know what the aims of the producers are.  It's all transparent, but once in a while there is a work of pure genius that makes me think I really don't know anything at all.  Memento is such a work.Looking at the premise of this movie, I recall that it can really happen.  Neurologist Oliver Sacks, in his wonderful book, The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat (1986), recounts the story of a man who could only hold the memory of the last thirty seconds or so.  Leonard's condition in this movie is better.  Apparently he can hold in his mind what has happened over the last few minutes.  Also he has the ability to follow a kind of learned routine in which he is able to function by continually writing himself notes.  In the case recalled by Dr. Sacks, the man could not do that.  He could not even remember enough to finish a short conversation.The idea of taking notes to ""remember"" is something that some Alzheimer's patients are able to do in the early stages of the disease (which may be where Jonathan Nolan got the idea for his short story on which the film is based.)  Sacks recalls such a case in his An Anthropologist on Mars: Seven Paradoxical Tales (1995).  The notes act as the man's memory, just as the notes and photos do for Leonard in this movie.The next question might be, could someone with Leonard's ""condition"" actually function well enough to get by without being institutionalized or having somebody take care of him on a minute to minute basis?  Leonard says, ""Habit and routine...conditioning make my life possible.""  He ""remembers"" to look in his jacket pocket to see where he is living.  Presumably he also does this when he is in his car and has forgotten where he is going and doesn't know where he is.  Presumably he has many notes that we don't see him refer to.  How does he find his way back to his car after going somewhere?  He identifies his car from a photo, but where is it parked?  In the scene where he wakes up next to Natalie, he gets up and goes to his jacket and finds her picture so he knows who she is.  He also finds a picture of her and Dodd.  He somehow ""remembers"" the significance and writes on the back of her photo, ""...she lost someone too.  She will help you out of pity.""  How does he remember these things?  Perhaps they are examples of ""implicit learning"" that ""Sammy"" was not able to accomplish, what Leonard calls ""conditioning.""  In implicit learning as opposed to ""explicit,"" we learn to do something without knowing we learned it.Regardless of these questions, this is a brilliantly conceived and plotted thriller, and the acting by the three principals is superb.  Guy Pearce plays Leonard in a most immediate and affecting manner so that we are forced us to identify with him and his predicament.  Carrie-Anne Moss, whom you may recall from The Matrix (1999), is mesmerizing with her sexy, mysterious eyes as the hard-edged and haunting Natalie.  Joe Pantoliano is first rate as Teddy, the wisecracking, cynical and rather annoying undercover cop.But what really makes this a stunning movie is the way it is constructed.  The scenes are presented in reverse chronological order, so that we know the latest action first, and at the end of the movie find out the earlier action.  This seems an extraordinary way to tell a story, but it works.  Incidentally, there's a Seinfeld episode told this way, the one where they go to India for a wedding; and to some extent this technique was employed in Quentin Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs (1992).  What makes it particularly effective here is the material.  Leonard, as Teddy points out, is not the same person he was before his wife's death and his injury.  For him the arrow of time has lost its meaning.  Earlier events are just the same as later ones.  Director Christopher Nolan (Jonathan's brother), who also wrote the screenplay, was able to dovetail the action scene by scene as we move backward in time so that what seems true in the beginning becomes different than what is true in the end.  And indeed, like Leonard, our experience of the story doesn't depend on time's arrow.Viewing this the second time (and you may feel a compulsion to do just that) some of the lines that were not funny initially become very funny.  The voice-over in the chase scene with Dodd is an example.  Leonard finds himself running and he says, ""So what am I doing?...I'm chasing him....No, he's chasing me!""  Or when Teddy asks about the gun, Leonard says, ""Must be his.  I don't think they'd let somebody like me carry a gun.""  Or Teddy's line to Leonard, ""I've had more rewarding friendships than this--but I get to keep telling the same jokes.""The key to the powerful psychological ""ending"" of the film, where we realize what will eventually happen, occurs when Natalie tells Leonard that revenge is useless because he won't remember it.  He replies, ""It doesn't matter whether I remember or not....""  Indeed we see that he really doesn't remember his revenge and that implies that he will...But you really need to see the movie to appreciate the stunning implication.On another level this is a movie about what makes us human.  What would life be like if we lived in an eternal present without reference to the past?  We could be easily exploited by those with knowledge of the past, as Leonard is, but there is a deeper question being asked.  Does life have any real meaning for a person without memory?",5,Brilliant,1095206400,"09 15, 2004",2004,5530,"['have', 'seen', 'lot', 'movies', 'almost', 'always', 'know', 'what', 'director', 'doing',

Carrie-Anne Moss is great.But the star of this movie is the storytelling device.  Told in 5-8 minute scenes shown in reverse order, this is a ripping good murder mystery yarn.  But if it was told in order, showing the wonderful twist ending first, there really wouldn't be much here.  This movie is a joy to experience, but I'm left with a sense of ""wait a minute"" when I reflect on the story and how it fit together--there's one unfortunate coincidence that a large part of the story turns on, and it makes the whole thing feel more contrived than clever.Pearce plays Leonard, a man who can't store any new long-term memories:  if it didn't happen in the last 5-8 minutes,  it didn't happen.  Notes to himself are his only record of events, and the reliability of these notes--even the permanent ones--is constantly tested.  He's riding the knife edge between this moment and the distant past--these are the only worlds he knows, and he lives his life as a victim to the cavernous gap between them.Now, this character has enormous potential that largely goes unrealized so that the film can concentrate on the plot, which focuses on Leonard's hunt for the man who murdered his wife.Carrie-Anne Moss is a waitress/love-interest(?) who is involved in a sub-plot that is never fully realized.  Her impact on the main story and the main character is what's important.The difficult thing is that because of his curious mental problem, no one in the movie can actually have impact on Leonard beyond messing with his head, which everyone in the movie takes an opportunity to do.  (Please note that I said ""everyone."")All in all, it's an enjoyable tale with a unique storytelling style populated with excellent performances from actors portraying characters whose development was sacrificed to the gods of plot and storytelling.Yes, this is one that Hitchcock would have wanted to make, but I daresay he wouldn't have done a better job--I think this one's as sharp and tasty as the script allows.

541733,A2198FZZMTJ38H,B00003CXZ3,D. Litton,"[0, 0]","The state of confusion I am left in after watching &quot;Memento&quot; is one that is as thought-provoking as it is maddening. The plot twists and surprises that director Christopher Nolan employs in his energetic, frenetic script are intelligent to a fault, ones that tease the mind for hours after the film has ended. And while I was still left with questions about certain plot points and character relations, I was nonetheless enthralled by the experience.At the center of this frenzy is Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce), a former insurance investigator in search of the man responsible for the rape and murder of his wife. His search is complicated by the fact that, due to his inability to create new memories, his short-term memory is of no help. He quickly forgets the beginnings of conversations with those he comes in contact with; his only way of staying on track are small notes on paper, Polaroids of those he meets and their names, and homemade tattoos that cover his chest and left thigh.And here's a surprising twist: the film is told from the end to the beginning, starting out with what should be the film's climax and taking things from there to the very beginning of Leonard's search. This is little more than a device, though it tends to make us ponder the film's many machinations on a much more intricate level of thought. There is more to keep up with, which makes it even more interesting.As we progress into the film, we are introduced to characters that Leonard has already interacted with at some earlier point in the reversed story. By the movie's midpoint, many of the puzzle pieces are in place: Leonard has been receiving help from Natalie (Carrie-Anne Moss), who is out for revenge against someone who took the life of her own love. At the same time, Leonard interacts with the man we see him killing in the beginning, Teddy (Joe Pantoliano), who offers him information we automatically assume is bogus.Or is it? The movie keeps this a secret even after its ending, inviting us to think on the subject, to ponder on the film's many turns and spins. There are so many questions that come to mind: who is really responsible for the murder of his wife? Who is the real ringmaster behind all of the mayhem that goes on throughout the film? Who is the mastermind? By the time we finish thinking about it, we're more concerned with who is on top rather than who killed Mrs. Shelby.And that is precisely what makes this such a fascinating film. It will turn many off for its lack of a final resolution that is blatantly obvious to everyone, but those in the mood for some deep thought will not pass this up. The ending provides no answers, no easy solution to its complex formula of mystery, leaving we, the viewers, to ponder the final conclusion in our own minds, and decipher what has just come to pass in front of our eyes.The film has its share of effective performances that range from subtle mysterious to all-out masterful. Guy Pearce brings a hushed fervor to his character, embodying Leonard with an inner willpower that keeps the film at a fever pitch. Carrie-Anne Moss is eerily mysterious as Natalie, whose intentions play a bigger role than you would first consider. Joe Pantoliano gives his character just the right appearance, that which instills a great sense of suspicion for his character, Teddy, who uses Leonard's memory loss to his advantage.My advice to anyone who sees &quot;Memento&quot; is simply this: don't give up on it. Appearances can be deceiving, and this is a fine example of that. Nolan's reversal device enhances rather than diminishes the movie's effects, perhaps because it allows us the chance to give serious thought to the events going on. I entered into this realm of filmmaking not knowing what to expect; I came out with a thought-produced headache of pure satisfaction.",4,Style and substance find a common ground in &quot;Memento.&quot;,999734400,"09 6, 2001",2001,3835,"['state', 'confusion', 'am', 'left', 'watching', 'quot', 'Memento', 'quot', 'one', 'as', 'thought-provoking', 'maddening', 'plot', 'twists', 'surprises', 'director', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'energetic', 'frenetic', 'script', 'are', 'intelligent', 'fault', 'ones', 'tease', 'mind', 'hours', 'film', 'ended', 'was', 'still', 'left', 'questions', 'certain', 'plot', 'points', 'character', 'relations', 'was', 'nonetheless', 'enthralled', 'experience.At', 'center', 'frenzy', 'Leonard', 'Shelby', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'former', 'insurance', 'investigator', 'search', 'man', 'responsible', 'rape', 'murder', 'wife', 'search', 'complicated', 'fact', 'due', 'inability', 'create', 'new', 'memories', 'short-term', 'memory', 'help', 'quickly', 'beginnings', 'conversations', 'contact', 'only', 'way', 'staying', 'track', 'are', 'small', 'notes', 'paper', 'Polaroids', 'names', 'homemade', 'tattoos', 'cover', 'chest', 'left', 'thigh.And', 'here', 'surprising', 'twist', 'film', 'told', 'end', 'beginning', 'starting', 'out', 'what', 'should', 'be', 'film', 'climax', 'taking', 'things', 'there', 'very', 'beginning', 'Leonard', 'search', 'little', 'more', 'device', 'make', 'ponder', 'film', 'many', 'machinations', 'much', 'more', 'intricate', 'level', 'thought', 'more', 'keep', 'up', 'even', 'more', 'interesting.As', 'progress', 'film', 'are', 'introduced', 'characters', 'Leonard', 'already', 'interacted', 'earlier', 'point', 'reversed', 'story', 'movie', 'midpoint', 'many', 'puzzle', 'pieces', 'are', 'place', 'Leonard', 'been', 'receiving', 'help', 'Natalie', 'Carrie-Anne', 'Moss', 'who', 'out', 'revenge', 'someone', 'who', 'took', 'life', 'own', 'love', 'same', 'time', 'Leonard', 'man', 'see', 'killing', 'beginning', 'Teddy', 'Joe', 'Pantoliano', 'who', 'information', 'automatically', 'assume', 'bogus.Or', 'movie', 'secret', 'even', 'ending', 'inviting', 'think', 'subject', 'ponder', 'film', 'many', 'turns', 'spins', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'questions', 'come', 'mind', 'who', 'really', 'responsible', 'murder', 'wife', 'Who', 'real', 'ringmaster', 'mayhem', 'film', 'Who', 'mastermind', 'time', 'finish', 'thinking', ""'re"", 'more', 'concerned', 'who', 'top', 'rather', 'who', 'killed', 'Mrs.', 'Shelby.And', 'precisely', 'what', 'such', 'fascinating', 'film', 'will', 'turn', 'many', 'off', 'lack', 'final', 'resolution', 'blatantly', 'obvious', 'everyone', 'mood', 'deep', 'thought', 'will', 'not', 'pass', 'up', 'ending', 'answers', 'easy', 'solution', 'complex', 'formula', 'mystery', 'leaving', 'viewers', 'ponder', 'final', 'conclusion', 'own', 'minds', 'decipher', 'what', 'just', 'come', 'pass', 'front', 'eyes.The', 'film', 'share', 'effective', 'performances', 'range', 'subtle', 'mysterious', 'all-out', 'masterful', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'hushed', 'fervor', 'character', 'embodying', 'Leonard', 'inner', 'willpower', 'film', 'fever', 'pitch', 'Carrie-Anne', 'Moss', 'eerily', 'mysterious', 'Natalie', 'intentions', 'play', 'bigger', 'role', 'would', 'first', 'consider', 'Joe', 'Pantoliano', 'character', 'just', 'right', 'appearance', 'great', 'sense', 'suspicion', 'character', 'Teddy', 'who', 'Leonard', 'memory', 'loss', 'advantage.My', 'advice', 'anyone', 'who', 'quot', 'Memento', 'quot', 'simply', 'do', ""n't"", 'give', 'up', 'Appearances', 'can', 'be', 'deceiving', 'fine', 'example', 'Nolan', 'reversal', 'device', 'rather', 'diminishes', 'movie', 'effects', 'perhaps', 'chance', 'give', 'serious', 'thought', 'events', 'going', 'entered', 'realm', 'filmmaking', 'not', 'knowing', 'what', 'expect', 'came', 'out', 'thought-produced', 'headache', 'pure', 'satisfaction']",Memento VHS

Most filmmakers playing with form -- in narrative or visual presentation -- find it difficult to marry the experiments they want to conduct with a compelling story.  Memento writer/director Christopher Nolan flies out from among his competition by finding a story which by nature demands an unconventional narrative approach, making Memento the four-aces masterpiece it is.The amazing thing is that Nolan makes you hang on to a story in which you find out the ultimate outcome of the plot in the very beginning.  Memento, however, makes you care about *how* something happened, the cause of the effects, and somehow manages to generate suspense even though you're watching events unfold backwards.  An astonishing writing feat.  The actors do a terrific job -- Guy Pearce wisely holds himself back and delivers a low-key, simmering performance and a deadpan voice-over job that are instantly winning; Carrie-Anne Moss continues to make smart choices in edgy roles, not content to milk her sex-symbol status; Joe Pantoliano's smarmy charisma comes through yet again as he chomps lines with gusto, coming out with some of the funniest moments in the film.  Nolan mines the central conceit of a character with no short-term memory for fresh comedic moments, and this also helps keep your attention even if you might sometimes get lost in its complicated plot.  And of course, the bounty of story twists and revelations make this movie a terrific rewatch experience.One of the best films of 2001, and certainly the most original.",5,Redefines cinematic language.

I wouldn't point out plot discrepencies, as I am the first one to check my brain at the door when seeing a movie. But this one seemed way too pretentious and self-indulgent to allow that to happen. To be fair, it had it's fair share of great moments. The clever chase scene where he figures out he is being chased is cool. The ending is surprising and interesting, it made me think about the movie a while afterwards. The only other complaint I have about this movie, is that if the story was told forwards it wouldn't make much sense, which is my core problem with the movie. It is stylistic, and has interesting ideas about human nature, but still it lacks cohesion and tries to reject hollywood conventions but falls right into them, it may not have the same story structure but that hardly makes it non-mainstream or artsy as some have put it.

Though it's seems unnatural at first, the way director Christopher Nolan pieces the film together flows really well.  If the unique style wasn't enough, the plot and message of this indie film are both superb.  Here Nolan takes the mystery genre to a fresh level that has yet to be discovered.  A man who's condition cripples him of gaining new memories tries to learn who killed his wife.  This movie also tackles many thought-provoking themes-purpose in life, the selfishness in mankind, trust, and memory.I really gained a great respect for Christopher Nolan, this being his sophmore film.  I also recommend watching his first feature &quot;The Following.&quot;  The performances by Guy Pierce, Carrie-Anne Moss, and Joe Pantoliano are all noteworthy.

What seperates Memento from Dana Carvey's comically fumbling opus &quot;Clean Slate,&quot; which had an eerily similar plot, is that Pierce's amnesia is based only around short term memories, which can be as frightningly annoying at times to the viewer as it is to Pierce. Memento also wreaks havoc with the usual time continuom, much in the same way that Pulp Fiction did, tracing it's characters personal history backwards. For the most part this works to great effect in creating an intriguing scenario and thickened suspense, although at times it neccessitates that the plot be overly simplified just so it's easier for the viewer to try to correctly piece everything together chronologically. This brings me to the major faults of Memento. Since the main character doesn't really know who anybody else is, neither do we. The characters are all paper thin and nothing more than shadows, leaving the viewer a little hollow. On top of the poorly (although albeit neccessarily so)defined characterization, the movie ends abruptly and somewhat unreasonably. The conclusion actually negates the importance of everyone we've been introduced to, and implodes what little we actually did know about them. The general feeling we are left with is one of emptiness, as if the previous hour was all just a waste of time. Understandably, this brings us closer to experiencing Pierce's feelings, but is ultimately detrimental. It seems like the writer was stretching for one last plot twist, ala Usual Suspects, that just wasn't feasible. Overall, the first three quarters of Momento is a four star movie, the last quarter is just sort of ridiculous.",3,Interesting premise somewhat undermined by sketchy script,1000080000,"09 10, 2001",2001,1770,"['Memento', 'Guy', 'Pierce', 'former', 'insurance', 'investigator', 'rare', 'form', 'amnesia', 'trying', 'track', 'down', 'wifes', 'murderer', 'What', 'Memento', 'Dana', 'Carvey', 'comically', 'fumbling', 'opus', 'quot', 'Clean', 'Slate', 'quot', 'had', 'eerily', 'similar', 'plot', 'Pierce', 'amnesia', 'based', 'only', 'short', 'term', 'memories', 'can', 'be', 'frightningly', 'annoying', 'times', 'viewer', 'Pierce', 'Memento', 'also', 'havoc', 'usual', 'time', 'continuom', 'much', 'same', 'way', 'Pulp', 'Fiction', 'did', 'tracing', 'characters', 'personal', 'history', 'backwards', 'most', 'part', 'great', 'effect', 'creating', 'intriguing', 'scenario', 'thickened', 'suspense', 'times', 'plot', 'be', 'overly', 'simplified', 'just', 'easier', 'viewer', 'try', 'correctly', 'piece', 'everything', 'together', 'chronologically', 'major', 'faults', 'Memento', 'main', 'character', ""n't"", 'really', 'know', 'who', 'anybody', 'else', 'neither', 'do', 'characters', 'are', 'paper', 'thin', 'nothing', 'more', 'shadows', 'leaving', 'viewer', 'little', 'hollow', 'top', 'poorly', 'albeit', 'neccessarily', 'so', 'defined', 'characterization', 'movie', 'abruptly', 'somewhat', 'unreasonably', 'conclusion', 'actually', 'importance', 'everyone', ""'ve"", 'been', 'introduced', 'what', 'little', 'actually', 'did', 'know', 'general', 'feeling', 'are', 'left', 'one', 'emptiness', 'previous', 'hour', 'was', 'just', 'waste', 'time', 'Understandably', 'closer', 'experiencing', 'Pierce', 'feelings', 'ultimately', 'detrimental', 'writer', 'was', 'stretching', 'one', 'last', 'plot', 'twist', 'ala', 'Usual', 'Suspects', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'feasible', 'Overall', 'first', 'three', 'quarters', 'Momento', 'four', 'star', 'movie', 'last', 'quarter', 'just', 'sort', 'ridiculous']",Memento VHS

541755,ARPI7ILEOQ848,B00003CXZ3,"EnglishTeacher ""scubabear""","[6, 8]","I read an extremely detailed review, with explicit spoilers, before seeing this film-- but still enjoyed it thoroughly.  It's the most original concept in film-making in recent years.The acting, camera-work and set-dressing don't make much impact, although-- to give credit where credit is due-- the realism in wardrobe, set-dressing, and dialogue is extremely well done.What sets this movie apart is the intricacy of the editing.  It's filmed in such a way that you'll thoroughly enjoy ""making an evening of it"" by inviting friends to watch the film, then discuss the plot afterward, over a long dinner.  Bonus points if you can figure out who the bad guy is, and a half-dozen other major plot points-- but DAMN, you'll have a fun time debating & puzzling over it.IMPORTANT:  Other reviews have (incorrectly) said that the film's sequences are shown backward.  This is not true.  Or rather, it's only half-true.  The film is made up of a series of 5-minute segments.  Half of them (let's call them M, N, O, P, ... Z) are shot in black and white, while the other half (let's call them A, B, C, D, E...K, L) appear in color.  The black-and-white segments are shown in reverse order (Z, Y, X, ...) and are interwoven with the color segments, which happen in chronological order (A, B, C...).  The result is a bit confusing:  The segments are shown in ""A, Z, B, Y, C, X, D, W, E..."" order.This interesting use of editing and sequence lets us completely enter the confusing world of the main character, who's unable to form new memories, and so, can't remember anything for longer than 5 minutes.  It also helps to keep us guessing about major plot points.Keep your eyes open for logical conflicts and what look like continuity errors, in the main character's oldest memories.  These apparent errors are particularly revealing, and closely model the way a real memory works:  impoerfectly remembering things, and hiding painful memories while editing & altering memories.",5,"you'll watch it several times, and each time enjoy it more.",1093824000,"08 30, 2004",2004,1967,"['read', 'extremely', 'detailed', 'review', 'explicit', 'spoilers', 'seeing', 'film', 'still', 'enjoyed', 'thoroughly', 'most', 'original', 'concept', 'film-making', 'recent', 'years.The', 'acting', 'camera-work', 'set-dressing', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'much', 'impact', 'give', 'credit', 'where', 'credit', 'due', 'realism', 'wardrobe', 'set-dressing', 'dialogue', 'extremely', 'well', 'done.What', 'movie', 'apart', 'intricacy', 'editing', 'filmed', 'such', 'way', ""'ll"", 'thoroughly', 'enjoy', 'making', 'evening', 'inviting', 'friends', 'watch', 'film', 'then', 'plot', 'afterward', 'long', 'dinner', 'Bonus', 'points', 'can', 'figure', 'out', 'who', 'bad', 'guy', 'half-dozen', 'other', 'major', 'plot', 'points', 'DAMN', ""'ll"", 'have', 'fun', 'time', 'debating', 'puzzling', 'over', 'it.IMPORTANT', 'Other', 'reviews', 'have', 'incorrectly', 'said', 'film', 'sequences', 'are', 'shown', 'backward', 'not', 'true', 'rather', 'only', 'half-true', 'film', 'made', 'series', '5-minute', 'segments', 'Half', 'let', 'call', 'M', 'N', 'O', 'P', 'Z', 'are', 'shot', 'black', 'white', 'other', 'half', 'let', 'call', 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'K', 'L', 'appear', 'color', 'black-and-white', 'segments', 'are', 'shown', 'reverse', 'order', 'Z', 'Y', 'X', 'are', 'interwoven', 'color', 'segments', 'happen', 'chronological', 'order', 'A', 'B', 'C', 'result', 'bit', 'confusing', 'segments', 'are', 'shown', 'A', 'Z', 'B', 'Y', 'C', 'X', 'D', 'W', 'E', 'interesting', 'use', 'editing', 'sequence', 'lets', 'completely', 'enter', 'confusing', 'world', 'main', 'character', 'who', 'unable', 'form', 'new', 'memories', 'so', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'anything', 'longer', '5', 'minutes', 'also', 'keep', 'guessing', 'major', 'plot', 'eyes', 'open', 'logical', 'conflicts', 'what', 'look', 'continuity', 'errors', 'main', 'character', 'oldest', 'memories', 'apparent', 'errors', 'are', 'particularly', 'revealing', 'closely', 'model', 'way', 'real', 'memory', 'works', 'impoerfectly', 'remembering', 'things', 'hiding', 'painful', 'memories', 'editing', 'altering', 'memories']",Memento VHS

541760,A2F5PAC9I5SCG6,B00003CXZ3,Ernest Jagger,"[4, 6]","Directed by Christopher Nolan, ""Memento"" is a Masterpiece of suspense. I highly recommend this film to all viewers. As the films narrative begins, we find the films main protagonist, Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce) as a man who suffers from a rare brain disorder caused by trauma. Leonard is unable to remember recent events that occur, and as a result, he must write down everything. Even going so far as to have tattoos on his body to remember the most important evidence which will help him find the man who killed his wife. Furthermore, he even takes photos of people to help him remember who they are. However, there is more to Leonard than we are led to believe, and I do not wish to divulge this information. Leonard has begun his search of the killer by relying on the tattoos on his body, and photographs that he keeps in his pocket--for if he does not, then 10 minutes later he will forget everything.Furthermore, even though Leonard is suffering from a loss of memory, and unable to remember events that occur, he is tormented by the death of his wife--and is relentless in his pursuit of the killer. He was a former insurance agent who one night was attacked in his home. With his wife murdered, while he was left for dead, the injuries caused are rare brain disorder which has left him frustrated in trying to uncover the truth. Moving along with the narrative, we see Leonard as an insurance investigator prior to his attack. He was responsible for uncovering fraudulent claims. And interspersed within the films narrative of Leonard's memory loss, we see him as a man who has denied the same claim by a man named Sammy (Stephen Tobolowsky). He denied the claim on the justification that the man was faking his illness in order to collect money. And Sammy's story is important to the film.Leonard's attempts in trying to track down the man who raped and murdered his wife is difficult. The problem is not only that Leonard has short-term memory loss due to a blow to his head when his wife was attacked, but moreover, who can he trust? Enter another protagonist in this film, Teddy Gammell (Joe Pantoliano). Can Leonard trust him? And what does Teddy know about Leonard that he is not telling him? The interesting part of this film is that it begins at the end and then proceeds backwards in reverse chronological order.

541761,A17IDP37NM8TFJ,B00003CXZ3,Eugene Chamson,"[2, 2]","I saw this film when it first came out in theaters about 10 years ago.  As has been well described in other reviews, it's a brilliant psychological thriller that keeps you guessing as you see each scene the way the main character would- without any memory of what came before.  As the film progresses, into the past, the mystery is gradually revealed, and what we find out at the end, which is what happened at the beginning, gives new meaning to everything that came after.  Sound confusing?  Well it is.  Which is why the film is worth seeing again.Seeing it again after 10 years was a strange experience, and even more fulfilling than the first time.  That's because I didn't remember how the story ended (or began), so I could appreciate the unraveling of the mystery anew.  And yet, with each new plot detail revealed, I began to have vague recollections of what would happen next.  That made each scene more significant and enjoyable.To put it another way, when you see the film the first time, you're mostly in the dark about what's really going on until the end.  And by then you may have forgotten much of what you saw because you didn't know it mattered at the time.  Seeing it again, each detail becomes richer in meaning, the film seems deeper, and I could appreciate it on another level.When you get past the superficial level of the plot mystery, what remains is a meditation on how we choose who we are in the world, and the role that memory plays.After seeing this film, you may feel just a bit queasy, as you consider whether the foundation of your reality is as firm as you thought. We are, after all, what we know.  And we know only what we can remember.  And memory is imperfect at best, and may in fact be just a well-crafted illusion to create the world we want to live in.  In that world, the meaning we bring to each new day is just a product of the memories we carry with us.

By chance, I visited a friend who has the original Blu-ray and was able to compare.  The 10th Anniversary Edition is not a re-packaging of the original with more extras (all the extras from the 2-DVD set are now present).  The picture is greatly improved (the original is 'soft' - the 10th anniversary edition shows much more detail).  Also, the strangeness of the menus on the 2-DVD set is gone.Note: The 2-DVD set allowed you to play the movie ""in reverse"", i.e. in chronological order.  That option is not present on either Blu-Ray release, as far as I can tell.

541765,A2KW2KWKABNYNO,B00003CXZ3,"Flap Jackson ""Sky Is Burning, But At Least We...","[1, 2]","I'll admit it, it took me nine years to get to this film. It couldn't possibly exceed the hype. There was just so much critical love for this film that it couldn't possibly deserve it. Yet, after the movie had ended for my first viewing, I was left with the words, ""Holy crap, that was pretty good."" My mind was blown at the ending, and after this mind-frak of a film, I left to meditate on it. Then I watched it again after a month, and I stuck with my original opinion that this is in fact, a really good and original thriller. Is it perfect? No, but it's still quite the classic and a must-see for everybody, at least once.If there's one reason to watch this movie, it's in the way it's presented. It starts at the end, starts at the beginning, and alternates between the two until they meet in the middle, to which the movie is wrapped up. It works for the story, and keeps the viewers on their toes in keeping track of everything. Let me illustrate to you the brilliance in this presentation. There's a scene where Carrie-Ann Moss comes up to Guy Pearce in her house, bleeding and bruised. She tells Guy Pearce that it was her boyfriend did it to her and that Guy needs to get rid of one of his associates. Seems harmless enough, right? Right, but you just watched the scene without context. Then it moves to the scene that led up to the previous scene. Carrie-Ann Moss comes into a room, Carrie-Ann Moss tells Guy that she's going to use him & proceeds to go on a obscenity-laced tirade directed towards Guy. Only problem is that Guy will never remember this conversation in a minute because he can't write down that Carrie-Ann Moss is actually bad. Guy then hits her, causing her to bleed, so Carrie-Ann Moss walks out the door. She sits in her car for a minute, and then Guy forgets everything that just happened to him, and Carrie-Ann Moss walks through the door as seen in the scene previously, or afterwords. It's more or less brilliant and Nolan uses it to his advantage to spice up an already great story.If there's on fact the movie wants to get across to you, it's that this short-term memory loss makes your life a living hell. The movie goes deep into the detail of how somebody with this condition would live. What are the downsides, what is their life like? Does the ending take things a little bit too far, in basically revealing that half of what the movie told you was a basically a lie? Yeah, maybe a little bit. But hey, the reveal speech by Joe Pantoliano and Guy Pearce is great. And again, it's a 'Holy Crap' moment that will leave you satisfied on your first viewing. Did I get the same feeling the second time around? No. Since I was diverted thinking about the mystery of it all, I started thinking about the more logical points of the movies and the detail. In this sense, the movie didn't hold up for me the second time around. Plus, I must ask, is Carrie-Ann Moss' character really necessary? I mean, besides the scenes that I mentioned above, was she really essential to the movie, or was she just a diversion, or just another person to manipulate Guy Pearce after Joe Pantoliano is gone?Overall, I would highly recommend seeing Memento once. Any more than that is risky. Sure, it's brilliant, but some of the magic from the first viewing was lost on the second, as least for me. Still a classic, I really hope I never get that short-term memory loss.",5,Remember Sammy Jankis,1278288000,"07 5, 2010",2010,3385,"[""'ll"", 'admit', 'took', 'nine', 'years', 'get', 'film', 'could', ""n't"", 'possibly', 'exceed', 'hype', 'was', 'just', 'so', 'much', 'critical', 'love', 'film', 'could', ""n't"", 'possibly', 'deserve', 'movie', 'had', 'ended', 'first', 'viewing', 'was', 'left', 'words', 'Holy', 'crap', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'mind', 'was', 'blown', 'ending', 'mind-frak', 'film', 'left', 'meditate', 'Then', 'watched', 'again', 'month', 'stuck', 'original', 'opinion', 'fact', 'really', 'good', 'original', 'thriller', 'perfect', 'No', 'still', 'quite', 'classic', 'must-see', 'everybody', 'least', 'one', 'reason', 'watch', 'movie', 'way', 'presented', 'end', 'beginning', 'two', 'meet', 'middle', 'movie', 'wrapped', 'up', 'story', 'viewers', 'toes', 'keeping', 'track', 'everything', 'Let', 'illustrate', 'brilliance', 'presentation', 'scene', 'where', 'Carrie-Ann', 'Moss', 'up', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'house', 'bleeding', 'bruised', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'was', 'boyfriend', 'did', 'Guy', 'get', 'rid', 'one', 'associates', 'Seems', 'harmless', 'enough', 'right', 'Right', 'just', 'watched', 'scene', 'context', 'Then', 'scene', 'led', 'up', 'previous', 'scene', 'Carrie-Ann', 'Moss', 'room', 'Carrie-Ann', 'Moss', 'Guy', 'going', 'use', 'proceeds', 'go', 'obscenity-laced', 'tirade', 'directed', 'towards', 'Guy', 'Only', 'problem', 'Guy', 'will', 'never', 'remember', 'conversation', 'minute', 'ca', ""n't"", 'write', 'down', 'Carrie-Ann', 'Moss', 'actually', 'bad', 'Guy', 'then', 'causing', 'bleed', 'Carrie-Ann', 'Moss', 'out', 'door', 'car', 'minute', 'then', 'Guy', 'forgets', 'everything', 'just', 'happened', 'Carrie-Ann', 'Moss', 'walks', 'door', 'seen', 'scene', 'previously', 'afterwords', 'more', 'less', 'brilliant', 'Nolan', 'advantage', 'spice', 'up', 'already', 'great', 'story.If', 'fact', 'movie', 'get', 'short-term', 'memory', 'loss', 'life', 'living', 'hell', 'movie', 'deep', 'detail', 'how', 'somebody', 'condition', 'would', 'live', 'What', 'are', 'downsides', 'what', 'life', 'ending', 'take', 'things', 'little', 'bit', 'too', 'far', 'basically', 'revealing', 'half', 'what', 'movie', 'told', 'was', 'basically', 'lie', 'Yeah', 'maybe', 'little', 'bit', 'hey', 'reveal', 'speech', 'Joe', 'Pantoliano', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'great', 'again', ""'Holy"", 'Crap', 'moment', 'will', 'leave', 'satisfied', 'first', 'viewing', 'Did', 'get', 'same', 'feeling', 'second', 'time', 'No', 'was', 'diverted', 'thinking', 'mystery', 'started', 'thinking', 'more', 'logical', 'points', 'movies', 'detail', 'sense', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'hold', 'up', 'second', 'time', 'must', 'ask', 'Carrie-Ann', 'Moss', 'character', 'really', 'necessary', 'mean', 'scenes', 'mentioned', 'was', 'really', 'essential', 'movie', 'was', 'just', 'diversion', 'just', 'person', 'manipulate', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'Joe', 'Pantoliano', 'gone', 'Overall', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'seeing', 'Memento', 'once', 'Any', 'more', 'risky', 'Sure', 'brilliant', 'magic', 'first', 'viewing', 'was', 'lost', 'second', 'least', 'Still', 'classic', 'really', 'hope', 'never', 'get', 'short-term', 'memory', 'loss']",Memento VHS

I had heard plenty of buzz about this film for years, but only recently saw it. At many points, I think the viewers are as perplexed as Leonard Shelby. Leonard Shelby(Guy Pearce), searching for his wife's killer, has a rare condition that doesn't allow him to remember certain events. Events are remembered only in a haphazard way, and, for this reason, he uses notes and pictures as an aid for his memory. What makes the film unique is simply the way it is told, using a non-linear or chronological way of telling the story, but rather scattered and fragmented bits and pieces of time through the point of view of Leonard. We have 10-15 minute segments that reveal events and partial memories, and we are constantly rewinding and fast forwarding to a slightly different version of the plot. It's a bit jarring at first, and difficult to follow, but it doesn't alienate the audience, and eventually the viewer is able to pick up on this type of narrative. Give Nolan credit for pulling off such a film and having very few inconsistencies. Several key characters could make or break the case in Leonard's search, but his reliance on scraps of paper and notes only give him partial, vague clues about who to trust. Therefore, from Leonard's point of view, the line between friend and enemy is always indistinct. Memento somehow manages to mimic its storyline with its film techniques, with scattered clues here and there, and is a cerebral whodunit experience for the viewer to try to piece together. It is also a unique, stylish, film that has great pacing and building suspense, and finishes with a nice twist. Just the kind of film for those who are sick of the same old, same old that Hollywood spews out.

It's better to let this movie take you on a backwards path from end to beginning.  It's truly fascinating. If you're not sure whether you'll like it, just look at the stars. You stand around a 90% chance of enjoying this film. From the moment I popped the DVD in, the main menu just blew me away. It's the MUSIC, by composer David Julyan. I watched this a couple months ago and the music stayed in my subconscious. Finally had to play the movie again, and I enjoyed it just as much as the first time, even after knowing all the twists and turns.I don't want to rehash what I'm sure most people do in these reviews. Reading them makes you feel sometimes like you're reliving Groundhog Day. One enjoyable thing was the way the DVD was produced. There is actually a dual main menu, and you can access the secondary one by slipping into the audio selections and then returning to the main menu. Even the building of the scene selections is a completely different approach to producing a DVD. More companies should be so innovative in bringing a fresh approach to creating unique menus.This is a great movie for thinking people to watch. It is one of the better- written and edited movies out there. And I know that most movie- goers want a movie that challenges the mind. Lenny (Guy Pearce) does plenty of thinking and I found myself trying to get into HIS mind because, while the story plays backwards, I want to know just where he's going and how he can keep his sanity. If I had the same condition as Lenny, I'd be completely paranoid -- I wouldn't trust anyone. What better way to remember than having information tattooed? But how easy you can be manipulated when you have short term memory loss.I see there is a new limited edition of Memento at about the same cost as the original DVD, and I plan on owning this one. Rent the film and you'll more than likely discover that you'll want to watch it time and again, so you may as well pick up a copy. Listen. Most people voted Memento with a perfect score and less than 10% gave it a &quot;D&quot; or worse grade in a highly- respected movie site with a total of over 67,000 votes. Across the board demographically, the voters gave it at LEAST 8/10, with women 45 or older giving it just under 8.

He's forced to take pictures of, and write notes on, the people he's met and places he's been. Despite his handicap, Leonard hopes to find those who raped and murdered his wife.Memento is the most innovative and absorbing thriller to come out in years. It begins at the end, and ends at the beginning. The story is told in segments, where the events of each subsequent segment precede the events of the previous segment. Simultaneously, black and white segments proceed in a chronological order. They're inserted in between the other non-chronological sequences.Christopher Nolan presents us with a thrilling and provocative noirish screenplay. He expertly looks at how memory can be manipulated, how far people will go to get what they want, trust, perception, and guilt. There are many twists and turns as we're kept on our toes as Leonard searches for those who destroyed his life.Guy Pearce carries the film on his head and shoulders; he is able to show just the right amount of anger, frustration, paranoia, and confusion in a masterful performance as Leonard Shelby. Pearce is backed up by strong supporting performances from Joe Pantoliano and Carrie-Anne Moss.Exhilarating and unsettling, Memento is a film you won't soon forget.",5,A film you won&#65533;t soon forget.,1036281600,"11 3, 2002",2002,1399,"['Ever', 'incurred', 'head', 'injury', 'attempting', 'stop', 'rape', 'murder', 'wife', 'Leonard', 'Shelby', 'Guy', 'Pearce', ""n't"", 'been', 'able', 'make', 'new', 'memories', 'forced', 'take', 'pictures', 'write', 'notes', 'people', 'met', 'been', 'handicap', 'Leonard', 'find', 'who', 'raped', 'murdered', 'wife.Memento', 'most', 'innovative', 'absorbing', 'thriller', 'come', 'out', 'years', 'end', 'beginning', 'story', 'told', 'segments', 'where', 'events', 'subsequent', 'segment', 'precede', 'events', 'previous', 'segment', 'Simultaneously', 'black', 'white', 'segments', 'proceed', 'chronological', 'order', ""'re"", 'inserted', 'other', 'non-chronological', 'sequences.Christopher', 'Nolan', 'thrilling', 'provocative', 'noirish', 'screenplay', 'expertly', 'how', 'memory', 'can', 'be', 'manipulated', 'how', 'far', 'people', 'will', 'go', 'get', 'what', 'want', 'trust', 'perception', 'guilt', 'are', 'many', 'twists', 'turns', ""'re"", 'kept', 'toes', 'Leonard', 'searches', 'who', 'destroyed', 'life.Guy', 'Pearce', 'film', 'head', 'shoulders', 'able', 'show', 'just', 'right', 'amount', 'anger', 'frustration', 'paranoia', 'confusion', 'masterful', 'performance', 'Leonard', 'Shelby', 'Pearce', 'backed', 'up', 'strong', 'supporting', 'performances', 'Joe', 'Pantoliano', 'Carrie-Anne', 'Moss.Exhilarating', 'unsettling', 'Memento', 'film', 'wo', ""n't"", 'soon', 'forget']",Memento VHS

I had heard that the film was done ""backwards"" but it didn't really click for me until I read a bit more. The movie is engaging and it makes you wonder what's going to happen next. In terms of the climax, lots of things cleared up by the time the black-n-white (forward) and the color (backwards) met up. That's when the movie really started making sense.There were some gross moments that turned my stomach, but other than that, the violence was tolerable. It wasn't as bad as I was expecting.Oh,since I did mark it spoiler, I believe that the cop was telling the truth about everything. For a few reasons, one of which was Lenny's memory of giving his wife an insulin shot. By the end, it seemed to me that he made up the story about Jenkins in order to ""deal"" with his role in his wife's death.

541773,ANBQIWHO9JRFS,B00003CXZ3,General Zombie,"[2, 5]","'Memento' is a film that I approached skeptically.  I'd heard nothing but good things, pretty much, but it sounded gimmicky, and like precisely the sort of slightly arty, slightly innovative film that stupid people and mainstream critics will see and proclaim it genius, and, worse yet, somehow imagine that their love of this film make them smart. (I'm no indie/intellectual film snob, mind you, but I can usually spot a sacred cow from quite a distance)  And I suppose I was right, partially, as looking at the review for this it's apparent that more than a few dummards are claiming 'Memento' to be the greatest, most original film ever.  And, yeah, they don't know what the hell they're talking about, but they manage to be almost right anyway.  Still, on top of being a first-rate thriller (well, more or less a thriller anyway.) 'Memento' has got a real human interest angle, and prods into some ideas with regards to reality and perception.(It may not be incredibly revelatory, but few films inspire the mind at all.)I suppose I should summarize the basic plot: Leonard Shelby is on a quest to avenge his murdered wife.  Unfortunately, during the attack he was injured, and can no longer make new memories.  Thus, he's got grope through the present, with only notes and tattoos and instinct to guide him towards his goal.  As you would imagine, this can get pretty damn complicated.  Personally, I don't think the whole backwards chronology gimmick is all that hot of an idea, in and of itself, and it's certainly not original to this film.  Of course, Nolan redeems it through the second conceit, which is that Leonard, has no short-term memory, thus placing us in his shoes, as much as is possible via the reverse chronology. (i.e. he doesn't know what happened in the previous scene, chronologically and neither do we.)  Normally, this would just be a cheap gimmick, an easy way for the director/writer to keep us in the dark, and create cheap, obvious ironies, but now there's actually a legitimate, defensible reason for presenting the film this way.It would be inappropriate to discuss plot details, though suffice to say that the other characters in the film well understand how easy it would be to manipulate a person with no memory.  Still, clever and intriguing as the plot is, the character of Leonard is perhaps the most interesting part of the film.  Personally, I find him to be a great, tragic and highly sympathetic figure.  He's particularly compelling to me, as I find revenge to be a rather romantic notion.  I'm sure many will disagree with me, and say that it's meaningless, but that's precisely the point.  This is heightened by the fact that Leonard will never know if he gets his revenge, not inside anyway.  But, the principle of the thing is enough to drive him.  Of course, we eventually learn that not everything is the way it appears, but this only undermines it all slightly, as there is still abundant reason why he should want to kill John G.  And, Leonard's condition is so hopelessly screwed up and existentially twisted that you can't help but feel for him.  Living completely in a void is a scary thing, and the film helps you  really reflect on these things in a way you probably haven't before.Performances are all excellent, though special note goes, again, to Guy Pearce as Leonard.  He's in a really complicated spot, as there really no guidebook for how to play this role, as he's got to continually be in a sorta semi-confused state, reacting to a scene as he perceives he should, but not really feeling why. (or vice versa)  Nolan's direction is stylish and sharp, though it doesn't draw as much attention to itself as it might have, which is probably a good thing.  The score is effective too, lotsa low-key, pulsing stuff, but still charged with emotion.Yeah, it's a great movie.  Clever plot + emotional resonance.

541776,AQSQLWD3NLMAS,B00003CXZ3,Glenn A. Buttkus,"[1, 2]","Director Christopher Nolan was unknown in 1996 as he took a cross-country trip with his brother, Jonathan; who pitched a storyline to him. Christopher loved it and they began to collaborate on the project. Christopher finished his screenplay for a future film before Jonathan finished his short story, which he called MEMENTO MORI. The film did not come to fruition immediately.Nolan was born in England, and he spent his childhood moving back and forth between the United Kingdom and the States; ending up with dual citizenship. In the middle 90's, he had shot a low budget film in London. It was called FOLLOWING, and it was released in 1998. It was shot in black and white, and it had a fractured non-linear plot line. Simultaneously, Nolan's lady friend, Emma Thomas, was pitching his finished script for MEMENTO. It was considered by the executives who saw it, ""the most innovative script"" that they had seen in ages. It was green-lighted, and given a budget of 4.5 million dollars. It was originally slated to be shot in Montreal, and then the project shifted to Los Angeles. It was said that at Cannes, after the screening of FOLLOWING, in 1998, Nolan gave a pitch to the audience for funding to make MEMENTO. One just has to admire such audacity.Nolan had felt for a long time that he liked the way commercials and music videos were shot in a non-linear fashion. He also responded to literature presented that way. So he decided to take the methodology, and what he learned on his first feature, refine it and transfer the concept to MEMENTO; creating a wondrous cinematic puzzle of a picture. It certainly is evident that he succeeded beyond his wildest imagination.MEMENTO raises the curtain showing us the end game, an action that is the result of circumstances we do not yet know, presented in color. Then it jumps to a separate narrative line, what we figure out is a flashback, presented in B&W;, with our protagonist, Leonard Shelby waking up in a ""strange"" motel room. That is when we discover, as he talks to someone on the phone, that he suffers from a rare form of amnesia, known as ""anterograde"". ""I know who I am. I just can't form new memories."" When he awakens in that motel room, or in any room, he seems to have to piece together just where he is. Then we are flashed forward to about five minutes ahead of where we left off in the color narrative. Lenny's attention span seems to be about 5 minutes, and each time it begins to fade, we are transported to the B&W; storyline shown in what seems chronological order. Odd as it seems, the color narrative is being shown in reverse chronological order; that is to say that the color section is presented in a linear fashion, but each time we return to it, it begins 5 to 10 minutes prior to where we left off, filling in some plot gaps as it approaches the inevitable fade out.As an audience, we are confused, dazzled, and fascinated as we endeavor the meaning of these two independent parallel timelines. We watch, we make assumptions, we surmise, and as the film comes to what might be closure we realize that the two narratives were not parallel, rather they were moving toward each other, one linear from the past, the other in a tantalizing mind-blowing reverse mode, kind of in the present. Suddenly, following the action in the B&W; narrative, the two timelines merge, and the action is transformed to color; with the narrative lunging toward us repeating the opening scene of the movie, becoming an action that is more like in the middle of the plotline. Are we more confused? A little perhaps. The plot threads converge and the ""mystery"" is explained, although it might not be accurately explicated, and in some ways it only deepens as even more options and solutions present themselves.Guy Pearce as Leonard Shelby was astonishingly good, both a lost soul and a dangerous avenger; a man so logical, so meticulous, so organized that he found a way to circumnavigate his inability ""to form new memories"". As an actor he has never been more physical, more intimidating and lethal, pulsating with pent-up emotion and energy -yet he manages to capture our empathy, and holds our attention, his hopes become ours, his quest our own. With the odd reverse narrative, the director gets us to rediscover time and place much as Lenny has to, as we careen along beside him, off balance, piecing together the plot like manic chimps putting together a puzzle while swinging on a rope; several ropes.Carrie Ann-Moss as Natalie the bar maid, the gangster's moll, a drug runner, a femme fatale, love interest, abuser, and ten times a bitch -was very effective, creating a character that we can not shake from our senses, emerging as sexy, selfish, and far from innocent. She aspired to be the queen bee, acting as a black widow, shamelessly manipulating all the men in her life; steering toward what she perceived was her big pay off.Joe Pantoliano, a veteran of putz roles, usually playing shady, vicious, unreliable, and untrustworthy types, leaves shadings of all this in his John ""Teddy"" Gammel, a man who misrepresents himself to Lenny, changes his identity often, and hides his purpose; whatever that might be, from hour to hour, from episode to episode. Yet his role as cop, or ex-cop, crooked and larcenous, comes off as semi-sympathetic -quite a feat for any actor.This film provokes discussion, after challenging the viewer to stay with it. Director Nolan has created a complex methodology that continues to perplex us, even after multiple viewings. The movie is not easily pigeon-holed or labeled. It requires that we consider the fragility and the ineptness of memory that includes some misrepresentations and implanted data, and is rife with occlusions. MEMENTO has dozens of scenes that change point of view, or particulars of plot, as we experience them; plot elements that surely are in conflict with themselves, perhaps even some teasing red herring moments. I feel that director Nolan intentionally played games with us, as his later suggestions of multiple endings, and his complex DVD and websites data are testament to. Regardless, this is a film like no other, an original that is worthy of both its accolades and its criticism.",5,Cinema of the Reverse,1199836800,"01 9, 2008",2008,6215,"['Director', 'Christopher',

The concept is good, but after the first half the movie gets a bit repetitive and unsurprising, culminating in a mildly disappointing ending. Still, the acting is top notch, since Guy Pearce truly is an excellent choice for the lead role, delivering a subdued and intriguing performance. Directing Christopher Nolan suceeds at creating a gripping and moody atmosphere with enough suspense and interest, grabbing the viewer`s attention. That`s particularly relevant, since in this story every detail counts. Well, the plot per se is hardly anything new, so what sets &quot;Memento&quot; apart from most thrillers is the way its story is told. As a whole, this effort is worthwile and appealing, yet it`s more cerebral, cold and distant than enjoyable, entertaining and warm. It`s also a bit too depressing, since the final revelation makes one look at the characters from a new (and darker) perspective. Still, &quot;Memento&quot; is a remarkable movie about human nature, lies, trust and love, providing a clever (perhaps too clever, by the way), unusual and witty mistery. It`s unfortunate that, at parts, it carries more style than substance, but it`s a solid cinematic experience nonetheless.Worth a look.

Me? I wake up every day with my coffee and open the internet hoping to find out in the news that our liberal world has literally ended, so it goes without saying that I wish the most miserable death on all feminists.Detecting liberal social-engineering both in and outside of entertainment is an instinctual skill of mine, it now runs on a subconscious motor, so I can't help myself.

Each element of the film - from the acting to the editing - is flawless, but Memento's genius is largely based on it's unique style of narrative.Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce) is suffering from a rare condition which has erased his short-term memory - or as he succinctly puts it, his ability to make new memories.  The film attempts  - and succeeds  - in recreating the world from Leonard's point of view. Thus, the first scene shows us what actually occurs at the end of the sequence of events that the film depicts - a polaroid of a dead man fading, then the event itself in reverse, a gun swallowing bullets, suddenly the man brought back to life. From then on we start at the beginning of a series of short scenes, each one starting where the next (previous) scene ends. In this way we are able to gain an insight into the bewildering, disorienting view of the world that Leonard is faced with, the only certainty, that his wife was brutally raped and murdered (he sustained brain damage trying to defend her) and that he must find her killer and exact vengeance. Leonard is able to make some sense of the world by writing things down, taking photographs of the people he becomes involved with, and for the really important ""facts"", tattooing them onto his body. Yet each time he wakes up, the only thing he remembers is that his wife is still alive, and the ways in which he is forced to realise what happened are heart-rending.A tremendous central performance from Pearce allied to a fine supporting cast (Joe Pantoliano, Carrie Ann Moss), taut script, evocative photography and brilliantly paced direction make Memento a truly memorable film, and one you won't want to miss.",5,Unforgettable,1021420800,"05 15, 2002",2002,1812,"['Chris', 'Nolan', 'mesmeric', 'thriller', 'Memento', 'dazzlingly', 'original', 'piece', 'filmmaking', 'likes', 'Hollywood', 'rarely', 'element', 'film', 'acting', 'editing', 'flawless', 'Memento', 'genius', 'largely', 'based', 'unique', 'style', 'narrative.Leonard', 'Shelby', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'suffering', 'rare', 'condition', 'erased', 'short-term', 'memory', 'succinctly', 'ability', 'make', 'new', 'memories', 'film', 'attempts', 'recreating', 'world', 'Leonard', 'point', 'view', 'Thus', 'first', 'scene', 'actually', 'end', 'sequence', 'events', 'film', 'polaroid', 'dead', 'man', 'fading', 'then', 'event', 'reverse', 'gun', 'swallowing', 'bullets', 'suddenly', 'man', 'brought', 'back', 'life', 'then', 'start', 'beginning', 'series', 'short', 'scenes', 'one', 'starting', 'where', 'next', 'previous', 'scene', 'ends', 'way', 'are', 'able', 'gain', 'insight', 'bewildering', 'disorienting', 'view', 'world', 'Leonard', 'faced', 'only', 'certainty', 'wife', 'was', 'brutally', 'raped', 'murdered', 'sustained', 'brain', 'damage', 'trying', 'defend', 'must', 'find', 'killer', 'exact', 'vengeance', 'Leonard', 'able', 'make', 'sense', 'world', 'writing', 'things', 'down', 'taking', 'photographs', 'people', 'involved', 'really', 'important', 'facts', 'tattooing', 'body', 'time', 'up', 'only', 'thing', 'wife', 'still', 'alive', 'ways', 'forced', 'realise', 'what', 'happened', 'are', 'heart-rending.A', 'tremendous', 'central', 'performance', 'Pearce', 'allied', 'fine', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Joe', 'Pantoliano', 'Carrie', 'Ann', 'Moss', 'taut', 'script', 'evocative', 'photography', 'brilliantly', 'paced', 'direction', 'make', 'truly', 'memorable', 'film', 'one', 'wo', ""n't"", 'want', 'miss']",Memento VHS

This movie is truly unmissable. It has been highly praised by critics and audiences alike, and in general has Wowed the world. I mean, it even earned a place on the IMDb Top 10 (out of 250!) films of all time. That is pretty impressive. I can see exactly why the world loves the movie. It's different, exhilarating, amazingly engaging, original, smart, involving and endlessly entertaining. Memento is just everything you want out of a smart and fun movie. You truly get your money's worth with this one. Now, where should I start? Hmm, yes, Christopher Nolan. What a guy. He put his heart and soul into this movie and has come up with a true original. The script was actually adapted from a short story but extended to a film that seems so totally new and fresh you would never guess it had been adapted from anything. Christopher's direction is brilliant. He uses black and white for the unforgettable flashback scenes and colour for the scenes that are happening at that time. The film pretty goes backwards but is never confusing if you watch it carefully. Another great thing at the movie is Guy Pearce. He is one heck of a performer! While not only truly believable, he somehow possesses his character into amazing form. We never really know if Pearce is acting or not. There are plenty more great things about the movie. The editing is effective, especially within the first few minutes. The voice-overs help you to understand where the movie is taking itself. Carrie Anne-Moss's character is very intriguing. This movie is shocking, intriguing and truly unforgettable. If you haven't seen it by the time I've finished blabbing about how good it was, then you should get help.

This movie might make you feel like tearing your hair out if you don't pay attention to something. Now, for the plot. The movie centers around Leonard, a man that has no short term memory. After he was hit in the head while trying to save his wife who got raped and murdered, he lost his ability to retain new memories. While he can remember everything up to the incident, everything since after around 15 minutes is impossible for him to remember. Leonard thus thinks that everyone is a stranger to him. He takes polaroid pictures of everyone that he has met and writes their name and information that he should retain about them from a past encounter. (if they're a liar, etc..) He also must take pictures of his car, and Inn where he stays. Lenny's goal is to kill the man who raped and murdered his wife. He's got one big gun and will do anything to find this man. He gets assistance from a cop and a good friend. But, he doesn't know who he can trust and life gets very hectic for him. The movie is told in reverse chronological order, going from the end until the start. Not until the very end (start...) of the movie will you understand everything. And then, you probably won't understand everything and will need to rewatch it. This movie is a masterpiece and it's one that I will definitely add to my collection.

I highly second those glowing reviews.Just two things, though:First, if Leonard can't remember anything since he and his wife were attacked, why does he remember his &quot;condition&quot; and explain it to everyone he meets?  He seems to never need prompting on this point - he doesn't even have a tatoo explaining it.  So, how could he remember it, since it happened after the attack and he can't remember anything he does, says, has done to him or said to him from that point on?For this reason I gave it four stars.  Otherwise it's excellent, and deserves multiple watchings.One other thing: At the end of the movie we see flashbacks (?) of Leonard with his wife.  There is a new tatoo on his chest that isn't there throughout the entire movie: &quot;I DID IT&quot;.  This was alluded to as a tatoo he would give to himself after killing his wife's murderer.So, was his wife really dead?  Was it all an act (remember, he accused his client of acting, right?)?  Was he dreaming of his wife being alive after his vengence?  Is this just a left-curve thrown in by the filmmaker to confuse us?An enigma inside an enigma....I also liked the menu &quot;clues&quot; - very clever, extending the story outside the bounds of the film itself....Also, Guy Pearce could be my best friend's twin brother... very surreal watching him....-",4,One Slight Flaw,1076889600,"02 16, 2004",2004,1430,"['So', 'lots', 'people', 'have', 'told', 'how', 'terrific', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'understand', 'highly', 'second', 'glowing', 'reviews.Just', 'two', 'things', 'First', 'Leonard', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'anything', 'wife', 'were', 'attacked', 'why', 'remember', 'quot', 'condition', 'quot', 'explain', 'everyone', 'never', 'need', 'prompting', 'point', ""n't"", 'even', 'have', 'tatoo', 'explaining', 'So', 'how', 'could', 'remember', 'happened', 'attack', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'anything', 'done', 'said', 'point', 'reason', 'gave', 'four', 'stars', 'Otherwise', 'excellent', 'multiple', 'other', 'thing', 'end', 'movie', 'see', 'flashbacks', 'Leonard', 'wife', 'new', 'tatoo', 'chest', ""n't"", 'entire', 'movie', 'quot', 'DID', 'IT', 'quot', 'was', 'alluded', 'tatoo', 'would', 'give', 'killing', 'wife', 'murderer.So', 'was', 'wife', 'really', 'dead', 'Was', 'act', 'remember', 'accused', 'client', 'acting', 'right', 'Was', 'dreaming', 'wife', 'being', 'alive', 'vengence', 'just', 'left-curve', 'thrown', 'filmmaker', 'confuse', 'enigma', 'enigma', '.I', 'also', 'liked', 'menu', 'quot', 'clues', 'quot', 'very', 'clever', 'extending', 'story', 'bounds', 'film', '.Also', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'could', 'be', 'best', 'friend', 'twin', 'brother', 'very', 'surreal', 'watching', '.-']",Memento VHS

541804,A192KEPM0HW6AC,B00003CXZ3,"Interplanetary Funksmanship ""Swift lippin', e...","[11, 52]","A friend recommended ""Memento"" to me, because I am very much into suspense thrillers. However, I approached it with a wary eye, as it was recommended to me by the same friend who suggested I see ""The Usual Suspects.""""Memento"" is unmomentous for the same reason ""The Usual Suspects"" was: It requires hanging all one's emotions as a viewer on the gimmick peg. For example, I stopped watching ""The Usual Suspects"" about 3/4 into the movie.""It was just, frankly, boring,"" I told my friend. ""I lost interest.""My friend screamed at me that I missed the big shock ending, in which Kaiser Sose is explained. I would've loved that movie, I was told, if I was simply patient enough to wait for the big payoff at the end.I countered that Hitchcock movies have big shock ending payoffs at the end, too, but that Hitch *kept the viewer interested* with taut suspense, a great plot and finely-honed dialogue.So, I went into ""Memento"" with a little more patience. I stuck with this one until the bitter end, and it was indeed bitter.The gimmick in this movie, which I picked up a third of the way into the inaction, is that it is shot in reverse time. Its hero, played by Guy Pearce, who must have graduated from the Keir Dullea Space Odyssey 2001 school of cardboard acting, suffers from a memory disorder. He can't remember what happened the day before, so he must reconstruct it physically -- with Polaroid shots and body tatoos -- to create a history for himself, so as not to go totally insane.  He also is tracking down a killer (a device borrowed from Hitch). When he catches the real killer, he can exonerate himself.But, the story is told with painstakingly pedantic scenes and horribly fake understatement. I had no sympathy for the hero at all, and if it weren't for some very good acting by Carrie Ann Moss and Joe Pantoliano, I probably would have tuned out early.The problem with ""Memento"" is that it tries to hard to be a film noir for our times, while ignoring just what it was that made those movies so memorable. Combing my mind, I cannot even think of one lesser film noir that was less entertaining than ""Memento,"" and no, I'm not forgetting ""Johnny Stool Pidgeon"" or ""Detour"" either. As far as ""The Big Sleep,"" ""Out of the Past"" or ""White Heat,"" forget about it! ""Memento"" is so far out of their league that it is an insult to compare this dreck with those great classics.Watching movies requires, as we all know, the ""willing suspension of disbelief."" And I've got plenty of that suspension: It keeps me well entertained even by such formulaic movies as ""Dodgeball"" and ""Mr. 3000."" When it comes to movies, I admit I am guilty to being an escapist.But, when something is just patently ridiculous that it defies belief, that's where I draw the line. In order to reconstruct his identity, Pearce has had tatoos embossed all over his torso. Okay, that's fine. I'll buy that.However, just look at those tatoos: The producers obviously wanted them to look so cool that they went whole hog that they had a tatoo artist not just scrawl utilitarian messages on his body, but recreate the Sistine Chapel according to Marilyn Manson across his chest and arms. This one affectation comes off as more pretentious than the entire final script for ""American Beauty.""Of course, there are no scenes of Pearce actually getting a tatoo. They would be too laughable.  However, I can imagine what one scene from the cutting room floor might look like:PEARCE: I need this tatooed.TATOO GUY: What does it say?PEARCE: ""He has a gun, and he's coming for you.""TATOO GUY: That's a lot of words, but if I just use navy blue, I can do it for you pretty cheap.PEARCE: Cheap? I have $1000. Go to town, man.TATOO GUY: Where do you get all that money? I mean, you live in a fleabag hotel, and with no obvious means of support.PEARCE: I got it from Chris Nolan, my director. He said I've got to look ""killer cool."" Use this CD cover as an example for your fonts.TATOO GUY: Wow, that IS cool. Motorhead's ""Sacrifice."" Lots of cool Goth script.PEARCE: That's right. We're going after the MTV crowd: Nolan told me not to worry too much that there's nothing really cool about me at all, at least not in the Robert Mitchum or Elvis sense. Nolan said ""image is everything,"" so with these tatoos, and working out at the gym all day, so that my pecs look really ripped, I can't lose.TATOO GUY: Bitchen, dude.Of course, there is a bona-fide shock ending by the time this mess wraps up, but you'll figure out that Pearce is the killer long before he does.If you have the intestinal fortitude to sit through this half-hearted art-school film, I recommend Edward Dmytryk's 1965 classic amnesia thriller ""Mirage"" as the perfect antidote. A tightly-shot thriller in the Hitchcock tradition, Gregory Peck doesn't need pecs nor tatoos to deliver a convincing performance. Instead, he uses Peter Stone's crafty dialogue. He also does something else that has eluded Guy Pearce.He *acts* .",2,Once You Get the Gimmick.....,1101168000,"11 23, 2004",2004,4944,"['friend', 'recommended', 'Memento', 'am', 'very', 'much',

The sooner you catch on to where the storyline is taking you the sooner you want to rewind and start over.Guy pierce is excellent- his portrayal of this strange character is memorable. The writing is also wonderful: he is witty, smart, yet at the same time oblivious to the nth degree. And thus he is vulnerable and taken advantage of by people around him.The film is also quite funny. Lenny suffers from a strange and unique condition, where he is incapable of making any new memory after he had an accident. So his mind hits the reset button every so often (sometimes quicker when his mind is racing).There is a scene where he is being chased by someone and in the middle of the run ""Ok, what am I doing here? Aha I'm chasing someone"" after a gunshot at him ""No, I think he's chasing me."" He is constantly talking to himself trying to make sense of his surrounding.I guarantee that this is one movie you'll have to watch twice. It's not very long (like and hour and half) so it's no big deal. You have to watch very carefully, paying close attention to the usage and morphing of the colors in the movie. Analogously: It has the same feel as the matrix, with better writing, better direction and the lack of superfluous action scenes.I can't promise that you will put it on your top ten list, but you will be thinking about it after the film for a while.

From the first minute of this thing I was hooked, held in trance for two hours until it ended...or should I say began? Employing a relatively unique approach to storytelling in a movie, Memento begins at the end and then works slowly backwards, kind of taking two steps back for every step forward. While initially somewhat disconcerting, it's eventually revealed to be a wondrously effective method that, to an extent, mirrors some of the confusion felt by Leonard. Because Leonard forgets information he knew the day before or even minutes before, the backward storytelling mechanism is able to function effectively for us, as information he knew at the beginning of events is not revealed to us until the end. Leonard's condition resultant from a head injury he suffered trying to save his wife--he writes everything down. However, his memories from before the incident are mostly intact, something that is both curse and blessing as memories of his lost wife--his lost life--torment and drive him. He prints notations on Kodak snapshots to retain photographic evidence for himself of, for example, which car is his, which hotel he's staying at, the people he knows--both the ones he believes are helping him and the ones he believes are not. The most crucial information he has tattooed on his body, and his entire body is crosshatched with inked information--clues to remember what has happened, what he's doing, vital information on the suspect he's pursuing--the most chilling of which is written backwards on his chest so he can read it in the mirror. Joe Pantoliano and Carrie-Anne Moss have absolutely killer roles and performances as supporting characters, and Guy Pearce's portrayal of Leonard is convincing beyond all measure. I was edge-of-the-couch engrossed in this, itching to find out what was what, who was who, and the twisting revelations gradually revealed along the way never ceased to intrigue and affect me.

The only problem with Guy's existence is that he has a &quot;condition&quot;...he doesn't process or remember short term memory.  He remembers details by taking Polariods.

541814,A2BFIYZYNK54QX,B00003CXZ3,"James Donnelly ""Ave Atque Vale""","[2, 3]","MEMENTO: Christopher Nolan's groundbreaking film that revealed to the world that he was one of the most unique new voices in cinema; a man that would prove to be one of the best filmmakers of the last two decades.I saw this film when it first came out in theaters, and I haven't seen it since. So why the 5-star rating? I was so totally compelled and profoundly disturbed by the film that it falls into the category of ""Brilliant Films I'll Never See Again"" (Another recent example of that is MARTHA MARCY MAY MARLENE). Guy Pearce is the kind of actor who never seems to get the acclaim he so richly deserves, and he's astonishing as Leonard. Joey Pants (Pantoliano) is chewing up a good deal of scenery in this film and certainly appears to steal some scenes, but Pearce's self-effacing charm and quiet intensity make you unable to take your eyes off him. Carrie-Anne Moss doesn't amount to as much as I would have preferred, although that may be more to do with her rather uninteresting performance.When you get right down to it, the film ultimately belongs to Nolan. By using the reverse-order single-scene narrative, he makes a film that is very uncomfortable to watch since the film essentially is taking place inside Leonard's fractured mind. Being inside of a mind like that is such a disturbing place to be, and I think that's what keeps me from watching the film again, but I can still say without a doubt, I still realize what a powerful, suspenseful and great film MEMENTO is, and I am doubly glad that Chris Nolan continues to make films that not only defy Hollywood convention, but they also push you and challenge your ideas. In another life, Nolan designed great mazes and created great riddles. In this life, you get to see them unfold on-screen, even if you don't get the answer or find the exit.With the exception of INSOMNIA, which is a film I respect but don't like, Nolan has made some of the very best films of the last decade.

There are small tidbits at a time, just enough to give a clue about what happened.  It's a truly amazing idea that keeps a viewer slightly off-center the entire movie.  Memento is truly ground-breaking when it comes to the movie-making aspect and story-telling style in cinema.The basic story of Memento is about revenge.  When someone wrongs someone you love, to what lengths would you go to avenge their death?  Now, throw in a slight road-block: you have no short-term memory.Leonard (Guy Pierce) wakes up unaware of anything.  The only clues he has are tattooed all over his body.  On his arms, on his chest, everywhere there is a patch of skin he has notes to himself.  The only thing he knows is that all his tattoos, and several polaroid photos, are clues towards the mystery that is his wife's rape and murder.The wide-reaching impact of short-term memory loss is immense.  A person could never go to school, learn a new language, quote a recent conversation, or visit an interesting site that was just happened upon.  And, depending on when the memory lapse hit, a person could forget something a simple as wiping after going to the bathroom.Of course, that could come in handy if someone happened to have a dreadful one night stand; they'd never have to own up to it.  Maybe they have a favorite book; each time it would be the best book ever.  Each surprise movie ending would be the same time and again (would really help when watching movies like Sixth Sense).Either way, the movie is incredibly well made, and a unique idea amidst a sea of retread garbage typically put out by major Hollywood productions.",5,Incredibly unique movie,1208649600,"04 20, 2008",2008,1730,"['reason', 'Memento', 'so', 'amazing', 'told', 'reverse', 'completely', 'unique', 'trend-setting', 'idea', 'are', 'small', 'tidbits', 'time', 'just', 'enough', 'give', 'clue', 'what', 'happened', 'truly', 'amazing', 'idea', 'viewer', 'slightly', 'off-center', 'entire', 'movie', 'Memento', 'truly', 'ground-breaking', 'when', 'movie-making', 'aspect', 'story-telling', 'style', 'cinema.The', 'basic', 'story', 'Memento', 'revenge', 'When', 'someone', 'someone', 'love', 'what', 'lengths', 'would', 'go', 'avenge', 'death', 'Now', 'throw', 'slight', 'road-block', 'have', 'short-term', 'memory.Leonard', 'Guy', 'Pierce', 'up', 'unaware', 'anything', 'only', 'clues', 'are', 'tattooed', 'body', 'arms', 'chest', 'everywhere', 'patch', 'skin', 'notes', 'only', 'thing', 'tattoos', 'several', 'polaroid', 'photos', 'are', 'clues', 'mystery', 'wife', 'rape', 'murder.The', 'wide-reaching', 'impact', 'short-term', 'memory', 'loss', 'immense', 'person', 'could', 'never', 'go', 'school', 'learn', 'new', 'language', 'quote', 'recent', 'conversation', 'visit', 'interesting', 'site', 'was', 'just', 'happened', 'upon', 'depending', 'when', 'memory', 'lapse', 'hit', 'person', 'could', 'forget', 'something', 'simple', 'wiping', 'going', 'bathroom.Of', 'course', 'could', 'come', 'handy', 'someone', 'happened', 'have', 'dreadful', 'one', 'night', 'stand', ""'d"", 'never', 'have', 'own', 'up', 'Maybe', 'have', 'favorite', 'book', 'time', 'would', 'be', 'best', 'book', 'ever', 'surprise', 'movie', 'ending', 'would', 'be', 'same', 'time', 'again', 'would', 'really', 'help', 'when', 'watching', 'movies', 'Sixth', 'Sense', '.Either', 'way', 'movie', 'incredibly', 'well', 'made', 'unique', 'idea', 'sea', 'retread', 'garbage', 'typically', 'put', 'out', 'major', 'Hollywood', 'productions']",Memento VHS

541822,A3DE1IYJGU5HPW,B00003CXZ3,Jason N. Mical,"[0, 0]","Strikingly original and gloriously film-noir, Memento is a rare film that finds the perfect marriage between substance and style without sacrificing the tension, drama, and humor in its well-written script.  The first offering from writer-director Christoper Nolan, and adapted from one of this own short stories, Memento engages audiences of all levels in a murder mystery of the first caliber.Leonard (Guy Pierce) is hot on the trail of the man who murdered and killed his wife.  He, too, was injured in the attack, rendering him unable to record any new memories - everything fades after around 10 minutes.  Although he remembers everything until he blacked out, including his wife lying dead on the floor, he has formed no new memories since that time.  This unusual condition has obviously rendered his search somewhat problematic, and Leonard is forced to rely on scribbled notes, photographs, maps, and tattoos to attempt to piece together his investigation.In what has been described alternately as a pedantic, pretentious film-school choice and a masterful way to tell a story, the story is told in 10-minute segments, starting at the END and working backwards.  Therefore, the audience can piece things together in a way Leonard cannot, and our reality becomes totally different from the main characters'.  In fact, one could make the case that Memento is a meditation on the meaning and reliability of memory in and of itself, but I'll leave that one to the scholars.With its legions of fans, it's a wonder this DVD wasn't released with more extras on it.  In fact, there are FOUR different versions of Memento on the world market, and all four DVDs have their strengths and weaknesses.  The American NTSC-format Region 1 version, seen here, has an interview and the incredible Memento website on it (which, I should note, adds to the story, but only look at it after you've seen the movie, because it might spoil some things).  The Canadian version of the film, also a Region 1 NTSC DVD by Alliance, has no extras but has an option where you can select the film's chapters in chronological order, allowing you to see the movie &quot;backwards&quot; (forwards, really).  The French and Belgian version is Region 2 PAL, and lacks all the extras but has an option where you can actually play the film in chronological order, instead of having to go back to the chapter screen 48 times.  And, last but not least, the planned UK Region 2 PAL release (slated to hit the streets on January 14, 2002) will have a director's commentary, the &quot;play chronologically&quot; feature, but none of the American version's extras.This shouldn't surprise people, as Memento was released first in the UK and did significantly better there at the box office than it did here.  However, unless you want to import a DVD from Europe - which requires a DVD player configured not only to play Region 2 discs, but one that can translate a PAL signal to an NTSC signal - the American version will be just fine.  The picture and sound are great, and the chronological mode is basically, as a friend put it, a gimmick.  And, with a movie as good as this, we can live without a commentary.",5,So Many Different Versions,999648000,"09 5, 2001",2001,3174,"['Strikingly', 'original', 'gloriously', 'film-noir', 'Memento', 'rare', 'film', 'perfect', 'marriage', 'substance', 'style', 'sacrificing', 'tension', 'drama', 'humor', 'well-written', 'script', 'first', 'offering', 'writer-director', 'Christoper', 'Nolan', 'adapted', 'one', 'own', 'short', 'stories', 'Memento', 'audiences', 'levels', 'murder', 'mystery', 'first', 'caliber.Leonard', 'Guy', 'Pierce', 'hot', 'trail', 'man', 'who', 'murdered', 'killed', 'wife', 'too', 'was', 'injured', 'attack', 'rendering', 'unable', 'record', 'new', 'memories', 'everything', 'fades', '10', 'minutes', 'everything', 'blacked', 'out', 'including', 'wife', 'lying', 'dead', 'floor', 'formed', 'new', 'memories', 'time', 'unusual', 'condition', 'obviously', 'rendered', 'search', 'somewhat', 'problematic', 'Leonard', 'forced', 'rely', 'scribbled', 'notes', 'photographs', 'maps', 'tattoos', 'attempt', 'piece', 'together', 'investigation.In', 'what', 'been', 'described', 'alternately', 'pedantic', 'pretentious', 'film-school', 'choice', 'masterful', 'way', 'tell', 'story', 'story', 'told', '10-minute', 'segments', 'starting', 'END', 'working', 'backwards', 'Therefore', 'audience', 'can', 'piece', 'things', 'together', 'way', 'Leonard', 'can', 'not', 'reality', 'totally', 'different', 'main', 'characters', 'fact', 'one', 'could', 'make', 'case', 'Memento', 'meditation', 'meaning', 'reliability', 'memory', ""'ll"", 'leave', 'one', 'scholars.With', 'legions', 'fans', 'wonder', 'DVD', 'was', ""n't"", 'released', 'more', 'extras', 'fact', 'are', 'FOUR', 'different', 'versions', 'Memento', 'world', 'market', 'four', 'DVDs', 'have', 'strengths', 'weaknesses', 'American', 'NTSC-format', 'Region', '1', 'version', 'seen', 'here', 'interview', 'incredible', 'Memento', 'website', 'should', 'note', 'story', 'only', 'look', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'movie', 'might', 'spoil', 'things', 'Canadian', 'version', 'film', 'also', 'Region', '1', 'NTSC', 'DVD', 'Alliance', 'extras', 'option', 'where', 'can', 'select', 'film', 'chapters', 'chronological', 'order', 'allowing', 'see', 'movie', 'quot', 'backwards', 'quot', 'forwards', 'really', 'French', 'Belgian', 'version', 'Region', '2', 'PAL', 'extras', 'option', 'where', 'can', 'actually', 'play', 'film', 'chronological', 'order', 'instead', 'having', 'go', 'back', 'chapter', 'screen', '48', 'times', 'last', 'not', 'least', 'planned', 'UK', 'Region', '2', 'PAL', 'release', 'slated', 'hit', 'streets', 'January', '14', '2002', 'will', 'have', 'director', 'commentary', 'quot', 'chronologically', 'quot', 'feature', 'none', 'American', 'version', 'extras.This', 'should', ""n't"", 'surprise', 'people', 'Memento', 'was', 'released', 'first', 'UK', 'did', 'significantly', 'better', 'there', 'box', 'office', 'did', 'here', 'However', 'want', 'import', 'DVD', 'Europe', 'DVD', 'player', 'configured', 'not', 'only', 'play', 'Region', '2', 'discs', 'one', 'can', 'translate', 'PAL', 'signal', 'NTSC', 'signal', 'American', 'version', 'will', 'be', 'just', 'fine', 'picture', 'sound', 'are', 'great', 'chronological', 'mode', 'basically', 'friend', 'put', 'gimmick', 'movie', 'as', 'good', 'can', 'live', 'commentary']",Memento VHS

Thinking is something we've all been doing a lot of lately, but for too long many of us have been content to allow our brains to slip into auto-pilot and cruise along unchallanged.So next time you go to the video store, put down that lame Adam Sandler movie you've already seen half a dozen times and rent this one instead.  Do your brain a favor and treat it to one of the most original and thought provoking movies of the last decade or so.

Leonard Shelby (Pearce) is obsessed with finding the man who murdered his wife.  However, due to the trauma he suffered during the struggle to save his wife, he now suffers from short term memory loss.  Due to this condition, he's only able to remember names, events, and places for a very short time before he completely forgets them.  He has resorted to taking polaroids, writing notes, and even tattooing messages on his body.Joe Pantoliano stars as Teddy, a person who befriends Leonard and tries to help him find the killer.  But is Teddy all that he seems to be?I found this movie to be very hard to understand.  In reality, it was made backwards; with the ending shown first, and the film then works backwards to the start. It was hard to keep track of the plot, and I really had to ""work"" to watch the movie and keep track of the events.  Some parts of the movie were good, but when the conclusion came, I was left with just as many questions as I was at the beginning (or should I say end?).

My opinion is my own and I hold no ill feeling to those that enjoyed this movie.  In fact I enjoyed it myself for the most part, but in my opinion, I walked from this movie with nothing.  It was entertaining to see how the movie progressed.  The story that unfolded backward was ingenious, but rough getting started.  The performances were excellent, as was the script.  Guy Pearce, Cary-Anne Moss and Joe Pantoliano all carry the movie so well.  My problem is that the entire movie gets you to sympathize with the character and by the end, you're not sure what to think.  I don't want to give much away by saying anymore.  The movie is obviously leaning toward being artistic, and that's fine.  And I do know something about art, I was an art major in college.  I guess my beef is that the movie is dark and down in it's tone, and many people will not find it entertaining in that respect.  Movies in general are supposed to entertain and with that said, if you don't find dark, moody, twisted and surreal entertaining, you probably won't find this all that much fun to watch.

541833,A3C6CZC2JP67VK,B00003CXZ3,"Jenny J.J.I. ""A New Yorker""","[5, 5]","Rarely have I watched a film that demanded that I pay such rapt attention to detail. Its series of segments, progressively reveal more of what happened but in backwards order. I had to expend a lot of mental energy comparing the events in each segment and piecing together what I thought actually happened. This method of filming alone is challenging but especially so given the main character's mental limitations. It is worth energy to figure out though!For those who don't know, ""Memento"" is a story of a man who loses his wife in a rape attack inside their home, pledging that he will track down a murderer for revenge and peace of mind. The main problem is that Lenny (Guy Peirce), after the attack, was left with a problem in that he cannot retain any long term memories. Well that's one brief summary of how to look at it, but there are others. Indeed this film is excellent and played with my emotions, emotions of sympathy, anger and questioning my own morals and judgments. Peirce is exceptional as the lead, and the characters that come into contact with him also give fine performances (notably Carrie-Anne Moss and Joe Pantoliano). Focusing on the problem of losing a memory after approximately 15 minutes, we begin to appreciate just how frustrating Lennys plight is.The film is beautifully shot and the editing and photography is even better. The best part: the film starts at the end and works it way to a middle point. That's because when the film comes to its end you really don't know if it's the beginning since you don't know what Leonard (Guy Pierce) did before arriving at an isolated place. This film can really be seen as reminiscent of the film style of Film Noir. It uses black and white scenes to give that off as well as the characters in the film constantly sucking Leonard further down into this world where he has no idea who and what to believe, including himself and the things he's done. Not only that but all the characters, yes even Leonard who is our protagonist, has a dark side of human nature to them. And that's what Film Noir is, exposing the dark side of human nature. The film has such a great Psychological deepness and by all means breaks the conventional art that goes into filmmaking. It really was a shame this film wasn't nominated for best picture. It greatly deserved that award and Nolan greatly deserved best director for it. Bottom line: Flat-out brilliant film-making and story-telling. One of the best films I've ever seen.

Even with amnesia, a person can establish an identity in a few weeks, judge new people and surroundings, and function.  In addition, such movie heroes are easy to identify with, because the audience seems to know as much as the hero.Well, in this movie, our hero has the opposite problem, an inability to make new memories.  And that kind of problem is indeed rare, and it merits some discussion.What would you do if you couldn't form new memories?  Well, you would probably be institutionalized, or cared for by family or friends.  Without that, it would be important to be in familiar surroundings as much as possible, ones you would remember.  You would remember your old house, your old car, and, of course, your old acquaintances.  But you would not remember new possessions or friends.  And you would be totally lost in a new town, while in your old one, you would know where your friends' houses were, where your bank was, where the restaurants were, and so on.You would need to avoid strangers.  And you would need a way to take notes, read and understand those notes, and keep a rough diary.  Probably you would need to trust a few friends to keep a few key documents and help you update them occasionally.  And you would also need a safety deposit box for notes, diary entries, money (even with a bank account, a safety deposit box would be very useful), and so forth.The key problems would be taking notes, figuring out how to make sure you could and would read and understand those notes, going on ""missions"" (even a short errand would be a major event), and keeping your privacy.For any important task, you would almost surely need to be backed up by a trusted friend, known by you from back when you were able to make memories.  That friend would need to be with you at such occasions or as a minimum constantly available by phone.You could write cryptic notes that only you could decipher, using your earlier memories.  But it would be hard to be sure just what secrets you had divulged.  Basically, you could keep your ideas private only by making sure nobody else saw them.  And that would be tricky.  That's one more place where a safety deposit box could help somewhat.I'm writing all this in order to explain just how weird the situation is for our hero in this movie, who is basically, um, ""open loop,"" and cut off from almost everything that is familiar.  It's a fascinating and suspenseful movie, but one can see that the hero is at a tremendous disadvantage.On the other hand, there are some things the hero knows quite well, and that makes the movie work.

In the movie ""Memento"" starring Guy Pierce, gives a good performance as a man who suffers from a memory disorder in which he can't make new memories after a severe accident with a killer who murdered his wife. Since he cannot make new memories, he has to write all information on photographs. Guy Pierce does not know who his friends or enemies are. He has to rely on his photogrpah notes to catch the murderer. When you first watch the movie you maybe confused like I was, because they play the movie backwards. But in the end it all comes out to a great ending. Infact, I had to watch the movie again to look some parts over. The suspense and intensity is unbelievable. Like I said Guy Pierce gives a good solid performance along with Joey pants, (A friend or a foe). Whats sad is that the movie almost did not go into production. The movie was finished filming around 97' but did not get released in theaters till 2000. It was also played in very select theaters as well. But it still frustrates me when i see a great movie that doesn't get any respect. This is why i hate Hollywood, they pump all these bogus movies up like the sixth sense, the village, and all those other lame thrillers but this one is left in the dust? You wanna see interesting thriller see Memento it won't dissapoint you. As far as the dvd goes, 5 stars as well. The limited edition especially is amazing.

541847,AVLJGDXO0ZZKI,B00003CXZ3,joe smo,"[1, 2]","I remember not liking this film that much after viewing it in the movie theatre, but that was because I didn't completely understand it. (I also was only about 12 years old). Unfortunately, when it was released on DVD I completely forgot about it, but I luckily chose to purcahse it a few days ago and am glad that I own it. I now appreciate it so much more. Memento, the innovative and intelligent thriller from Christopher Nolan was certainly one of the best films of 2001 and is one of my personal favorites.  Nolan is a gifted director and adapts a  screenplay based on a fascinatingly original short story written by his brother, Johnathan Nolan.Guy Pearce plays Leonard Shelby, a man seeking vengeance after his wife is raped and murdered.  Unfortunately, after the incident, he can't remember anything and is unable to create new memories.  The film is very unique for many reasons: great performances all around (especially from Joe Pantoliano as Teddy who just about steals the show from Pearce, also Carrie-Anne Moss who proves that she's more than just a pretty face and action star as Trinity from ""The Matrix"" and turns in a superb performance as Natalie.The film is also told in reverse, and starts from the end.  This is not exactly a typical, mainstream film and is probably not for everyone.  Nolan is definetly a talented director, his more conventional follow-up ""Insomnia,"" (2002) was also great.This is a film you will think about for awhile, it's not an easy film and it might take some time to figure it out.  It's essentially a puzzle.  This film easily rewards repeated viewings.  Memento, is a film-noir classic.  Nolan is movinginto different territory though with his next film, the highly anticipated ""Batman Begins.""  That should most definetly be promising.  I own the regular edition of this film, which is fairly weak, so I suggest purchasing the delux, 2-disc edition. Overall, in my opinion, this is a film which is worth owning, but if you haven't seen it, definetly rent it.Memento is rated R for Violence, Language and Some Drug Content.  The film features very little violence, mainly some gunplay, (some of which is bloody), a few punches here and there and quite a bit of profanity.

Like that way underappreciated classic, Memento gives you the ending immediately, and then spends the rest of its time showing you how it got there. Each scene offers clues and various revelations--Leonard's tattoos, why he writes what he does on Natalie's and Teddy's pictures, what happened to his wife, Leonard's job before &quot;the incident&quot;--each of which are thrilling mini-narratives in themselves.The acting is first rate. Guy Pearce, best known as &quot;the one who wasn't Russell Crowe in L.A. Confidential&quot;, is Leonard, a character who will intrigue you, engage your sympathy, and might even scare you by the end. Joe Pantoliano's Teddy will have you debating his intentions towards Leonard for days afterwards. The real acting coup, however, is fellow Matrix alum Carrie Anne Moss--her performace as Natalie will make you love her, hate her, and make you fiercely protective of her.The movie can only be watched on DVD. Keep the remote handy as you'll want to pause every now and then, if only to read Leonard's tattoos for various clues. After watching the movie, be sure to check out Otnemem in the Special Features section for newspaper articles, pictures, journal entries, and psychiatric reports on Mementos intriguing characters. They will help confirm what you think happened in the movie.  DVD also offers the playful option of choosing to watch the movie backwards (or would it be watching the movie forward?). You will definitely consider the option after watching the movie. I haven't done it yet, but I can't wait to see the effect that it has on the movie.This movie is worth the critical hype.

541853,A2HVFBVT0X1IP1,B00003CXZ3,Jonah Cohen,"[0, 0]","There is much good to be said about Memento. The low-key direction is a big plus (no annoying swells in the soundtrack and such) that adds to the tension. The cast, principally Guy Pearce, Joe Pantoliano &amp; Carrie-Ann Moss, is terrific. And that's just for starters.The best thing about it is the story. You probably know the basics: Leonard Shelby (Pearce) out to avenge wife's murder, has no short term memory, scenes are shown in reverse chronological order. This is a high concept that is done very well. Memento may be one of the cleverest movies ever. Not only are you caught up trying to figure out what's going on, but many of the scenes are surprisingly powerful: Leonard's tatoo-covered body, his attempts to assert that memory is over-reated, one character showing how easy it is to manipulate someone with his condition. And &quot;Do not believe his lies&quot; can take its place along with &quot;Rollo Tomassi&quot; and &quot;Who is Keyser Soze?&quot; in the neo-film noir hall of fame.A few gripes: the big twist at the end, while a good one, didn't strike me as quite as original as the rest of the movie. (Don't worry, no spoilers; but I can think of another flick that had a rather similar twist at the end.) A story this complex probably leaves a few goofs in continuity, though it takes some careful observation to spot them. And duh! How on earth did whoever produced this DVD avoid the most obvious feature: a version with the scenes in chronological order? What were they thinking?That said, this is a great movie with mondo potential (demand, almost) for multiple viewings. Watch carefully.

When he gets no response except what sounds like muffled screaming from the bathroom, he immediately gets out of bed and picks up his gun to investigate the situation.  As he opens the bathroom door, he finds what seem to be a man atackaing his wife.  Leonard shoots one man directly in the head, seeming to kill him.  When he goes to check if his wife is okay, he is pushed from behind by another man, slamming his head and falling to the ground beside his wife.  As he lays their next to his wife, staring into her eyes, the second attacker runs away and the scene fades to darkness.  This is Leonard Shelby's final memory.  The only thing Leonard has as he begins his search for the man who raped and killed his wife and destroyed his ability to create new memories is a name: John G.This is the basis of Memento, one of the most interesting and imaginative movies ever created.  Without the ability to hold a thought for more than a few minutes, Leonard has developed a system of ways to keep track of his investigation through a complex series of notes, photos, and tatoos.  The movie is played backwards in a way that a scene is shown for about ten minutes and then another scene is shown of how that scene came to be, and this goes on and on throughout the whole movie.  If the beginning, which is shown at the end, hadn't been done so well, this form of showing the movie would be terrible.  It is, however, very effective in this case.As Leonard continues his backward search, he meets up with both allies and enemies, most of those he meets are both.  Everyone seems to take advantage of his memory problem is some shape or form.  A personal favorite is the hotel worker who rents him out two rooms, even though he only uses one at a time.  At the end of the movie, most people won't belive that the movie is over.  The ending really seems to leave you hanging.  But this is only because the ending is the beginning and the real ending is shown at the beginning of the movie.  If you think about what happened during the movie, it should all add up.This movie isn't for everybody, though.  If you talk during the movie or someone talks to you during the movie, you'll miss something.  If you watch the whole movie with no or very few interruptions, you will be greatly rewarded with the privalige of watching (and hopefullly understaing) an amazing film.  This movie may be too fast paced for most, and not everyone will appreciate the backward story telling (it takes some getting used to), but ultimately this film is worth watching, even if it's only to be able to discuss the ending endlessly with those who watch the movie with you.",5,A Movie That Acually Makes You Think(!?),1000857600,"09 19, 2001",2001,2784,"['When', 'Leonard', 'up', 'night', 'find', 'wife', 'not', 'next', 'bed', 'automatically', 'demanding', 'late', 'When', 'response', 'what', 'muffled', 'screaming', 'bathroom', 'immediately', 'bed', 'up', 'gun', 'investigate', 'situation', 'bathroom', 'door', 'what', 'seem', 'be', 'man', 'atackaing', 'wife', 'Leonard', 'shoots', 'one', 'man', 'directly', 'head', 'seeming', 'kill', 'When', 'check', 'wife', 'okay', 'pushed', 'man', 'slamming', 'head', 'falling', 'ground', 'wife', 'next', 'wife', 'staring', 'eyes', 'second', 'attacker', 'away', 'scene', 'darkness', 'Leonard', 'Shelby', 'final', 'memory', 'only', 'thing', 'Leonard', 'search', 'man', 'who', 'raped', 'killed', 'wife', 'destroyed', 'ability', 'create', 'new', 'memories', 'name', 'John', 'G.This', 'basis', 'Memento', 'one', 'most', 'interesting', 'imaginative', 'movies', 'ever', 'created', 'ability', 'hold', 'thought', 'more', 'few', 'minutes', 'Leonard', 'developed', 'system', 'ways', 'keep', 'track', 'investigation', 'complex', 'series', 'notes', 'photos', 'tatoos', 'movie', 'played', 'backwards', 'way', 'scene', 'shown', 'about', 'ten', 'minutes', 'then', 'scene', 'shown', 'how', 'scene', 'came', 'be', 'whole', 'movie', 'beginning', 'shown', 'end', 'had', ""n't"", 'been', 'done', 'so', 'well', 'form', 'showing', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'terrible', 'however', 'very', 'effective', 'case.As', 'Leonard', 'backward', 'search', 'up', 'allies', 'enemies', 'most', 'meets', 'are', 'Everyone', 'take', 'advantage', 'memory', 'problem', 'shape', 'form', 'personal', 'favorite', 'hotel', 'worker', 'who', 'out', 'two', 'rooms', 'even', 'only', 'one', 'time', 'end', 'movie', 'most', 'people', 'wo', ""n't"", 'belive', 'movie', 'ending', 'really', 'leave', 'hanging', 'only', 'ending', 'beginning', 'real', 'ending', 'shown', 'beginning', 'movie', 'think', 'what', 'happened', 'movie', 'should', 'add', 'up.This', 'movie', ""n't"", 'everybody', 'though', 'talk', 'movie', 'someone', 'talks', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'miss', 'something', 'watch', 'whole', 'movie', 'very', 'few', 'interruptions', 'will', 'be', 'greatly', 'rewarded', 'privalige', 'watching', 'hopefullly', 'understaing', 'amazing', 'film', 'movie', 'may', 'be', 'too', 'fast', 'paced', 'most', 'not', 'everyone', 'will', 'appreciate', 'backward', 'story', 'telling', 'getting', 'used', 'ultimately', 'film', 'worth', 'watching', 'even', 'only', 'be', 'able', 'discuss', 'ending', 'endlessly', 'who', 'watch', 'movie']",Memento VHS

I don't know who decided to make it in such a way, but I truly believe they need to rethink their strategy - not everyone has the patience to play games with a DVD each time they want to watch it, and those of us renting it from our local soul-destroying chain video store that shall remain nameless, don't get the inlay cards etc. leading to a puzzling night...It challenges a lot of our assumptions of truth and memory and really forces us to home in on our own ideas of which narrative we believe, and should we trust the narrator.Basically each disc has a set of psychiatric test questions that loop around, and depending on your answer offer you various bonus features.Disc one isn't too hard to work out, but disc two can be prohibitively obstinate.  Thank god then for the invention of the &quot;Internet&quot;. Accessing this through a &quot;Computer&quot; will lead you to a bunch of fan sites that have maps and hints to guide you through the labyrinth, which does come off as being slightly rewarding.The movie opens at the end and replays in short segments leading up to the beginning of the plot, while it alternates with black and white sections that go forward in time to the start of the real plot. The plot itself is dark and disturbing, yet tinged with a surprising amount of humor (&quot;See, I have this condition...&quot;).The main reason I picked up this DVD was the &quot;alternate endings&quot; feature on the back of the box. This turns out to also be slightly misleading. What you can get is 3 different directors commentaries over the ending, with three different ways to interpret the closing (or opening?!) scenes.  I actually found this really cool, as each narrative presented by the director is presented as fact, and it's really cool to watch them all back to back with the thought &quot;I'm being lied to!&quot; in the back of your mind.  That's pretty damn cool.Very rarely a movie comes along that is so good it makes you rethink everything you once thought about movies.  Memento is that kind of film.The other special feature I was really looking forward to is the chance to see the whole movie in the correct sequence, which is also buried in Disc 2.  This will certainly clear things up for anyone that didn't understand it the right way round, but I got kinda bored watching the straight version, possibly cos I'd just watched the &quot;right&quot; version the day before.Anyway, memento will make you a better person and cause girls to fall at your feet.

Parry,"[0, 0]","I was able to buy this DVD when it appeared in my Amazon Gold Box (having a one-year-old in the house, the Gold Box is the only way I can buy DVD's anymore!), and I could not refuse the [inexpensive] price I was offered.  I'm very glad now that I opened my Gold Box at the right time.  Even at full-price, this is a must-see film.My first introduction to director Christopher Nolan's work was in Insomnia- another must-see if you haven't already.As the Amazon review explains, Shelby Leonard (Guy Pearce) is a man with an unusual mental condition that prevents him from creating new memories.  To complicate the situation, he is trying to search for his wife's murderer.  The police won't help him because they don't believe him- as they see it, the case is open-and-shut.The most effective way Christopher Nolan found to confuse the viewer (as much as Leonard must have been) was to portray the film in ten-minute segments- in reverse.  This technique reminded me a little of Tarantino's jump-around technique in Pulp Fiction, but ""Memento"" was more linear- the end of one segment was the beginning of the previous segment.Although I was expecting all of this from reading the other reviews here, I was not expecting to get as thorougly confused as I did.  I paid full attention to what was happening, but at the end I still felt like my head was spinning.  I have seen several movies that have left me confused (case in point: Eyes Wide Shut.  I'm sure Kubrick was a wonderful director, but I still don't get the way that film unfolded), but this left me pleasantly confused; I'm still thinking about it several days later, and enjoying the film even more in retrospect.The entire cast was well-chosen, from Guy Pearce as the fiercely determined Leonard, to Carrie-Anne Moss as the highly intriguing Natalie.  I'm still not sure if she was a ""bad guy"" or a ""good guy.""  Joe Pantoliano (Moss' co-star in ""The Matrix"") was also excellent as John G./Teddy.Although the beginning of the movie starts with finding out the identity of Leonard's wife's killer, the film is most definitely not that simple.  At the end, the film takes everything you've expected thus far and throws it upside-down.I don't typically get into ""thinking person's"" movies (neither does my husband), but this was one such movie that I'm sure I will be watching again, to see what I missed the first time around.For film buffs, the limited edition packaging is also a great perk: it is modeled after Leonard's evidence file in the film.",5,"An intriguing film, but you've got to pay attention!",1029196800,"08 13, 2002",2002,2507,"['was', 'able', 'buy', 'DVD', 'when', 'appeared', 'Amazon', 'Gold', 'Box', 'having', 'one-year-old', 'house', 'Gold', 'Box', 'only', 'way', 'can', 'buy', 'DVD', 'anymore', 'could', 'not', 'refuse', '[', 'inexpensive', ']', 'price', 'was', 'offered', ""'m"", 'very', 'glad', 'now', 'opened', 'Gold', 'Box', 'right', 'time', 'Even', 'full-price', 'must-see', 'film.My', 'first', 'introduction', 'director', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'work', 'was', 'Insomnia-', 'must-see', 'have', ""n't"", 'already.As', 'Amazon', 'review', 'explains', 'Shelby', 'Leonard', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'man', 'unusual', 'mental', 'condition', 'creating', 'new', 'memories', 'complicate', 'situation', 'trying', 'search', 'wife', 'murderer', 'police', 'wo', ""n't"", 'help', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'him-', 'see', 'case', 'open-and-shut.The', 'most', 'effective', 'way', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'found', 'confuse', 'viewer', 'as', 'much', 'Leonard', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'was', 'portray', 'film', 'ten-minute', 'segments-', 'reverse', 'technique', 'reminded', 'little', 'Tarantino', 'jump-around', 'technique', 'Pulp', 'Fiction', 'Memento', 'was', 'more', 'linear-', 'end', 'one', 'segment', 'was', 'beginning', 'previous', 'segment.Although', 'was', 'expecting', 'reading', 'other', 'reviews', 'here', 'was', 'not', 'expecting', 'get', 'thorougly', 'confused', 'did', 'paid', 'full', 'attention', 'what', 'was', 'happening', 'end', 'still', 'felt', 'head', 'was', 'spinning', 'have', 'seen', 'several', 'movies', 'have', 'left', 'confused', 'case', 'point', 'Eyes', 'Shut', ""'m"", 'sure', 'Kubrick', 'was', 'wonderful', 'director', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'way', 'film', 'unfolded', 'left', 'pleasantly', 'confused', ""'m"", 'still', 'thinking', 'several', 'days', 'later', 'enjoying', 'film', 'even', 'more', 'retrospect.The', 'entire', 'cast', 'was', 'well-chosen', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'fiercely', 'determined', 'Leonard', 'Carrie-Anne', 'Moss', 'highly', 'intriguing', 'Natalie', ""'m"", 'still', 'not', 'sure', 'was', 'bad', 'guy', 'good', 'guy', 'Joe', 'Pantoliano', 'Moss', 'co-star', 'Matrix', 'was', 'also', 'excellent', 'John', 'G./Teddy.Although', 'beginning', 'movie', 'finding', 'out', 'identity', 'Leonard', 'wife', 'killer', 'film', 'most', 'definitely', 'not', 'simple', 'end', 'film', 'everything', ""'ve"", 'expected', 'thus', 'far', 'upside-down.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'typically', 'get', 'thinking', 'person', 'movies', 'neither', 'husband', 'was', 'one', 'such', 'movie', ""'m"", 'sure', 'will', 'be', 'watching', 'again', 'see', 'what', 'missed', 'first', 'time', 'around.For', 'film', 'buffs', 'limited', 'edition', 'packaging', 'also', 'great', 'perk', 'modeled', 'Leonard', 'evidence', 'file', 'film']",Memento VHS

And considering that it was a semi-independent film (meaning that it went to indie film fests, though it still had enough money to cast some pretty big names, like Carrie-Anne Moss), it makes me wonder why Hollywood is blowing hundreds of millions of dollars on mediocre films - instead of unforgettable ones like this one.Memento is the story of Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce), a man who lost his short-term memory when he tried to save his wife from the man who raped and murdered her.  Intent on revenge, Leonard keeps track of the facts with the help of Polaroids, scribbled notes, and tattoos, which tell him which hotel he's staying in, who he can trust, and who's lying to him.The story is filmed in Tarantino-like intensity - in short clips, jumping from one story to another.  To complicate things even more, the scenes are shown in reverse chronological order.  You view each scene through the main character's eyes - not knowing what happened earlier.  In the end, everything you took as a given is shaken - and you're left wondering who the bad guys really were and who was telling the truth.When it was all over, I spent hours working everything out, playing everything in true chronological order.

The whole &quot;backwards&quot; premise works amazingly well, and is one of the best ideas ever devised for a film, reminiscant of PULP FICTION. Guy Ritchie is Sammy, a man who loses his short term memory when his wife is murdered and he gets attacked. Joe Pantiliano (THE MATRIX) is Lenny, a guy who may, or may not be Sammy's friend. The search for the elusive &quot;John. G&quot; provides for some chilling moments. Sammy's condition forces him to tattoo himself with notes like &quot;Never answer the phone&quot;, which racks up the tension and pushes the limits of audience's cerebral limitations. One of those films which you have to watch two or three times to fully understand it and get the whole idea, it's endless in it's creative concepts, leaving the viewer surprised and somewhat confused. Director Nolan does the best with the inventive tricks and piecing together the plot machinations.

Some people complain about the ""gimmick"" but I just think these people are missing the point. Guy Pearce's character has a form of amnesia that makes it impossible for him to form new memories, so he has no short term memory. He has long term memory going up until the trauma occurred which left him with this affliction. The movie tries to let the audience know what this would be like.

I see it pretty much as a mind boggling and extremely original movie that is extraordinarily inventive in how it's told.  From the very beginning or should I say the very end of this film to the end or was it the beginning, this film will lead you in the process of here's how it ended and now let's work out how we got there.  I simply cannot think of any other film that I've seen that has been portrayed in such a manner and oddly enough, it works wonderfully for this thriller.Simply put, to make this movie work, it had to take some of Hollywood's best on screen talents and that is exactly what the producers of this film came up with.  Guy Pearce's performance as a man who cannot make new memories is stunning to say the least.  The ever beautiful Carrie-Anne Moss of &quot;Matrix&quot; fame performs brilliantly, showing that she definitely has talents outside of the &quot;Matrix.&quot;  Joe Pantoliano, most recently acclaimed for his performance during his stint on &quot;The Sopranos,&quot; performs exceptionally well in this film, just showing that he gets better and better with every role.The movie was based on an original short story by Jonathan Nolan and Christopher Nolan took it and ran with it, culminating in this extremely intriguing revenge thriller.  Christopher Nolan most certainly deserves all the praise and accolades he has and continues to receive for the originality of concept in the screenplay and his directing performance of this film.The Premise:Guy Pearce plays Leonard Shelby, a rather odd individual who at one point seemingly had the perfect life with his wife yet one day that came crashing down on him when he awoke and found men attempting to rape and kill his wife.  During that incident he struck his head on the wall and has, since that time, not been able to make any new memories.  What follows from there is an intriguing tale in which Leonard, who is constantly taking Polaroid snapshots, making notes and doing self tattoo's to remind him of the &quot;facts,&quot; attempts to seek revenge upon the person responsible for his wife's death...I would definitely recommend this mind boggling, well told revenge thriller for any and all who are interested in this type of film, Guy Pearce's performance alone makes this film one to watch!  {ssintrepid}Special Features:-IFC Interview with Writer/Director Christopher Nolan-Theatrical Trailer and TV Spot-&quot;Following&quot; Trailer-Tattoo Gallery-Director &amp; Cast Biographies",4,Memento - Intriguing and original!,1074384000,"01 18, 2004",2004,2542,"['quot', 'Memento', 'quot', 'can', 'obviously', 'be', 'described', 'many', 'ways', 'see', 'pretty', 'much', 'mind', 'boggling', 'extremely', 'original', 'movie', 'extraordinarily', 'inventive', 'how', 'told', 'very', 'beginning', 'should', 'say', 'very', 'end', 'film', 'end', 'was', 'beginning', 'film', 'will', 'lead', 'process', 'here', 'how', 'ended', 'now', 'let', 'work', 'out', 'how', 'got', 'there', 'simply', 'can', 'not', 'think', 'other', 'film', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'been', 'portrayed', 'such', 'manner', 'oddly', 'enough', 'wonderfully', 'thriller.Simply', 'put', 'make', 'movie', 'work', 'had', 'take', 'Hollywood', 'best', 'screen', 'talents', 'exactly', 'what', 'producers', 'film', 'came', 'up', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'performance', 'man', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'make', 'new', 'memories', 'stunning', 'say', 'least', 'ever', 'beautiful', 'Carrie-Anne', 'Moss', 'quot', 'Matrix', 'quot', 'fame', 'brilliantly', 'showing', 'definitely', 'talents', 'quot', 'Matrix.', 'quot', 'Joe', 'Pantoliano', 'most', 'recently', 'acclaimed', 'performance', 'stint', 'quot', 'Sopranos', 'quot', 'performs', 'exceptionally', 'well', 'film', 'just', 'showing', 'better', 'better', 'role.The', 'movie', 'was', 'based', 'original', 'short', 'story', 'Jonathan', 'Nolan', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'took', 'ran', 'culminating', 'extremely', 'intriguing', 'revenge', 'thriller', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'most', 'certainly', 'praise', 'accolades', 'receive', 'originality', 'concept', 'screenplay', 'directing', 'performance', 'film.The', 'Premise', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'Leonard', 'Shelby', 'rather', 'odd', 'individual', 'who', 'one', 'point', 'seemingly', 'had', 'perfect', 'life', 'wife', 'yet', 'one', 'day', 'came', 'crashing', 'down', 'when', 'awoke', 'found', 'men', 'attempting', 'rape', 'kill', 'wife', 'incident', 'struck', 'head', 'wall', 'time', 'not', 'been', 'able', 'make', 'new', 'memories', 'What', 'intriguing', 'tale', 'Leonard', 'who', 'constantly', 'taking', 'Polaroid', 'snapshots', 'making', 'notes', 'doing', 'tattoo', 'remind', 'quot', 'facts', 'quot', 'attempts', 'seek', 'revenge', 'person', 'responsible', 'wife', 'death', 'would', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'mind', 'boggling', 'well', 'told', 'revenge', 'thriller', 'who', 'are', 'interested', 'type', 'film', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'performance', 'alone', 'film', 'one', 'watch', 'ssintrepid', 'Special', 'Features', '-IFC', 'Interview', 'Writer/Director', 'Christopher', 'Nolan-Theatrical', 'Trailer', 'TV', 'Spot-', 'quot', 'Following', 'quot', 'Trailer-Tattoo', 'Gallery-Director', 'amp', 'Cast', 'Biographies']",Memento VHS

A supremely intelligent and sensitive man, he remembers everything up to the point he became ill, but now exists in a perpetual and bewildering &#34;now.&#34; He fills notebooks endlessly with the phrase &#34;Now I am finally awake,&#34; and even though he sees where he has already written the same thing, he has no memory of doing so. His impression of his condition is of having suddenly awakened from a coma - at every moment. Yet he is able to play a piece of music from start to finish with no trouble, because each moment of the music flows seamlessly into the next. He has a touching relationship with his wife - if she is out of his sight for even a few moments, when he sees her again, he reacts as joyfully as if their meeting was a reunion after a long absence.Wearing's plight as presented in the film forces us to confront what it means to be human - whether we are the sum total of our memories, or if there is some essence which transcends this. &#34;Memento&#34; is a thriller based on this interesting and compelling condition, with the scenes in reverse order, so the audience does not &#34;remember&#34; what happened any more than the main character, who suffers from a milder form of Wearing's condition, does. &#34;Prisoner of Consciousness,&#34; if you can find it, is a far superior and ultimately more moving film.",3,Prisoner of consciousness,1403308800,"06 21, 2014",2014,1553,"['34', 'Prisoner', 'Consciousness', '34', 'documentary', 'Clive', 'Wearing', 'music', 'scholar', 'who', 'contracted', 'case', 'encephalitis', 'rendered', 'incapable', 'retaining', 'memories', 'more', 'few', 'seconds', 'time', 'supremely', 'intelligent', 'sensitive', 'man', 'everything', 'up', 'point', 'became', 'ill', 'now', 'perpetual', 'bewildering', '34', '34', 'endlessly', 'phrase', '34', 'Now', 'am', 'finally', 'awake', '34', 'even', 'where', 'already', 'written', 'same', 'thing', 'memory', 'doing', 'so', 'impression', 'condition', 'having', 'suddenly', 'awakened', 'coma', 'moment', 'able', 'play', 'piece', 'music', 'start', 'finish', 'trouble', 'moment', 'music', 'seamlessly', 'next', 'touching', 'relationship', 'wife', 'sight', 'even', 'few', 'moments', 'when', 'again', 'as', 'joyfully', 'meeting', 'was', 'reunion', 'long', 'absence.Wearing', 'plight', 'presented', 'film', 'forces', 'confront', 'what', 'be', 'human', 'are', 'sum', 'total', 'memories', 'essence', '34', 'Memento', '34', 'thriller', 'based', 'interesting', 'compelling', 'condition', 'scenes', 'reverse', 'order', 'audience', 'not', '34', 'remember', '34', 'what', 'happened', 'more', 'main', 'character', 'who', 'milder', 'form', 'Wearing', 'condition', '34', 'Prisoner', 'Consciousness', '34', 'can', 'find', 'far', 'superior', 'ultimately', 'more', 'moving', 'film']",Memento VHS

I was hooked on this film from the opening sequence and even though I was in the ballpark in terms of unraveling the puzzle, the ending surprised me.  The most important thing is that the ending fit.  The idea of a man trying to find the person who raped and murdered his wife is old enough, but the twist of making the protagonist devoid of short-term memory is utterly fascinating.  But what makes &quot;Memento&quot; great is what writer/director Christopher Nolan does with that clever idea.  Those who complain that the story is one of those post-&quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; films that plays around with the time should just calm down and realize the story is simply being told in a regressive manner, with each scene taking us back for the next key piece in the puzzle.  Guy Pearce turns in an utterly convincing performance as Leonard Shelby, the man with a mission but no short-term memory, with Carrie-Anne Moss as Natalie, the woman who appears to be helping him, and Joe Pantoliano in a restrained performance as Teddy, who cannot be trusted according to the note Leonard has penned on the back of his polaroid.  The DVD version has a few select treats: Christopher Nolan is interviewed about both &quot;Memento&quot; and his previous film, &quot;Following&quot;; the short story by his brother Jonathan Nolan, which inspired the film and was written contemporaneously; background information about the characters and events you have to searh and find in the &quot;otnemem&quot; section.

Carmel ""justwanderin""","[2, 2]","so the movie itself it first class first of all - innovative, extremely hard to follow and requires several viewings. the way the dvd's are produced is another thing - the film itself as well as all the options and extras are all kinda like easter eggs that you have to find. the disc itself only specifies the actual features i.e. the nice sundance channel documentary, the original short story memento mori, the trailers and picture gallery, but you have to pay a lot more attention to find the really hidden easter eggs, and boy the dvd doesn't make it easy to find them, even if you found instructions on the web of how to locate them!the most important easter egg is the film in reverse sequence, i.e. in the realtime chronological order of the scenes - very nice to watch but only after you've seen the original sequence of the feature. another easter egg is a couple of japanese posters for the film and a nearly impossible to read journal made by leonard (i couldn't read any of it, maybe you need a hi-def tv for that...)but for me the best easter egg is the alternate director's commentaries. basically for the last 20 minutes of the commentary track, there are 4 separate commentaries by the director. i won't tell you how to find them (and not many website will) but needless to say they are so hard to find that i still haven't managed to listen to one of those 4 commentaries. the first one is a continuation of the commentary from the rest of the film, i.e. talking about the movie etc., two other commentary tracks concern teddy's character with opposing views about him in each track. this is a fantastic idea because different people will hear different commentaries about teddy (assuming they've found the easter egg) and will draw different conclusions about him, and then in some hypothetical debate they'll go head-to-head with those who'd heard the opposing commentary track, if you know what i mean. finaly the fourth alternate commentary is the most interesting just because it's recorded backwards! i'd love to hear what's being said about it but to do that you'd need to record the track on a tape deck and then play it in reverse... not quite sure how to do that nowadays since i don't even own a tape deck but it would be interesting to hear what's on it.i also read that none of the bonus features from the original one-disc dvd are included in this special edition 2-discer so that's a shame, but then again all those easter eggs will eventually drive you insane anyway so no need for even more extras!a couple of final notes, apart from the alternate commentaries, the actuall full-length director's commentary can become tedious just because he never shuts up and just moves from one idea to another without any break in between them, and he doesn't always sound very clear with his low british accent voice. finally guy pearce in great in this movie and boy was i surprised to learn he's the guy from Priscilla Queen of the Desert!

The word ""memento"" means ""remember"" in Latin, and the story is about Leonard, so traumatized by a blow to the head after his wife's rape and murder, that he has lost his short-term memory. He's out for revenge and is looking for the killer, but, although he remembers his life with his wife and who he is, he cannot remember anything that has happened since.  He therefore takes Polaroid shots of everyone he meets and writes notes on them.  And he also tattoos things he wants to remember all over his body. The role calls out for an exceptional actor and Guy Pearce certainly does rise to the occasion.  I found myself drawn to him, identifying with his condition, and joining him in his struggle to relate to the world.The story unfolds backwards, an unusual narrative technique that is tricky to use.  We see a scene and think we understand.  And then there is another scene that has happened prior to it, and it totally changes our perception of what is going on.  Purposely, it is confusing.  And purposely, there are moments of clarity where it all fits together only to become even more confusing in the next scene.  Carrie Ann Moss plays a femme fatal and, as we get to know her, we are not quite sure what her motives are.  Joe Pantolino is cast as in the role of Leonard's buddy, and we are constantly confused as to whether he is friend or foe.I sat there fascinated as this complicated plot unfolded, enjoying the mastery in which the director led me down different avenues of thought and also introduced questions about the moral issues involved.  By the end, I was absolutely sure of nothing at all, except that I had been traveling on a roller coaster of an experience that didn't have any easy answers.  While I tend to want films to have a beginning, middle and end, and a story line that is easy to follow, this an exception to the rule.

The main character, Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce)  has lost his short-term memory.  His long-term memory is intact.  He can remember details and everything that happened before his ""accident"", but cannot retain what he has done or said five or ten minutes after doing anything (anterograde amnesia).  He is unsure of who to trust, who are his friends, what is true and his only goal is revenge, finding the man who raped and murdered his wife.  He is focused only on justice.He is well-built, thin, handsome, wearing expensive suits, driving an expensive jaguar, but lives in ratty, run-down motels, paying cash for all he wants.  He is a former insurance investigator, very aware of his handicap, explaining to people in great detail why he has trouble knowing them or remembering what he told them.  He has to rely on others, his index cards, photos, and skin tattoos to latch on to his past thoughts and observations.Leonard has psychological issues as he fights and struggles to interpret the evidence he finds and keeps on index cards and hiding places.  The film starts from the endpoint, the murder of ""Teddy"" known as John Edward Gammell.  The film re-winds and stalls in the present at times -  it is complex and confusing to refigure the frames and realize how the meaning of events changes.  The bad and good criss-cross as the story unfolds.  It seems the color scenes are shown in reverse order and black and white are chronological.  The two sequences come together at the end of the film.Leonard meets a woman named Natalie after finding a note in his clothes.

Pearce does just that, and by taking photos and writing notes on them, he is able to remind himself of the facts he has discovered during the course of his investigation and ultimately solve the mystery.I also enjoyed Pearce's role as the professor in the recent remake of the Time Machine.

He can plan for the future, but forgets within minutes every detail that was ever happening since his injury.The very last thing Leonard remembers permanently, is the pain to see his wife dying, and his permanent will for revenge.People used to say, time can heal every pain. But he cannot remember anything since, he even does not know how much time passed by: &quot;How am I supposed to heal if I can't feel time?&quot; He's searching for revenge as if this would comfort and relieve him. But he cannot even remember, if his wife is really dead (he saw her dying, but maybe she recovered?), he does not know if he already got revenge ... Sure, he has his photos, but other than people with a normal memory, if he doesn't like the truth he can simply burn a photo in order to clear his conscience.Trying to give the viewer a feeling of his &quot;condition&quot;, the film jumps backward in time, step by step, tells the reason later than the event, thereby fully stretching the VIEWER's attention and short-term memory. Only at the end of the movie, i.e. the beginning of the story, the viewer can know, should know, if all of Leonard's conlusions have been logical, in other words, whether or not he punished the right one (or two?).It's almost impossible to understand the complete plot after seeing this movie only once, and even after the second time you will still not be sure.

This outstanding suspense thriller gets just about everything right. It's stylish, tricky, clever and intriguing. It's the kind of movie that makes you think, leaves you guessing and causes you to debate it with the people you watched it with. If it has a fault, it's that it pays no mind to the modern phenomenon of limited attention spans. Pay attention or be lost.The movie opens with a shot of a hand waving a Polaroid snapshot. But, wait a minute! This photo isn't coming into focus, it's fading away. We are going backwards. Each scene shows what happened before the preceding scene. Because of the marvelous way it is edited, it isn't that hard to follow. The result is not so much one of confusion as it is one that demonstrates how tricky memory can be.The protagonist, Leonard [Guy Pearce], has anterograde memory loss, which is a condition that makes it impossible to make new memories. This condition is the result an injury he received on the night his wife was brutally murdered. He attempted to save her, or that's the way he remembers it. Now he is on a quest to find her killer. This is an almost impossible task for him. If he meets someone, he won't remember doing so ten minutes later. If someone talks to him too long, he won't remember the first of the conversation. It makes him easy to victimize, and, along the way, he meets several characters who do just that. At the same time, we slowly begin to wonder if Leonard is, in fact, a victim. There is something not quite right with his story.Leonard's long term memory is perfectly intact. He remember everything from before the injury. He has a methodical personality and uses all sorts of tricks to help him remember things now. He constantly writes notes. He uses Polaroids to remind him of who he has met and where he has been. He even goes so far as to have pertinent facts tattooed on this body, so that when he wakes up every morning, he will remember his mission. It is important to note that Leonard isn't looking for justice. He's seeking revenge.Guy Pearce is stunning as Leonard. His role is much more difficult than he makes it appear to be because he must create in us empathy and understanding for a character who, because of his condition, basically has no personality we can relate to. How do you relate to someone who never remembers he's ever met you? A bond could never exist. Yet Pearce does make us care about Leonard.This is director Christopher Nolan's second film. His first, which was shot on video and is in black and white, is so obscure you'd be hard pressed to find anyone who's seen it. After Memento, be promises to be a very recognizable creative talent.There is something reassuring to me about this movie's success. [People] have voted Memento number eleven on [a] site's list of best movies ever made. While I might not rank it that high on my own list, the important point is that, of the 12,000 plus votes cast, about half came from people under twenty-five years old. This group rated it even higher than older voters. The fact that all those kids can be so impressed by a literate, intelligent movie that has no special effects and no pop music soundtrack is something that others in Hollywood should pay attention to. Perhaps the business would be well served by more movies that challenge their audiences.",5,Best thriller of 2001.....2000.....1999.....1998....1997....,1016064000,"03 14, 2002",2002,3455,"['NOTE', 'Written', 'August', '2001Though', '2001', 'far', 'not', 'early', 'say', 'Memento', 'one', 'Top', 'Ten', 'movies', 'year', 'outstanding', 'suspense', 'thriller', 'just', 'everything', 'right', 'stylish', 'tricky', 'clever', 'intriguing', 'kind', 'movie', 'think', 'guessing', 'debate', 'people', 'watched', 'fault', 'mind', 'modern', 'phenomenon', 'limited', 'attention', 'spans', 'Pay', 'attention', 'be', 'lost.The', 'movie', 'shot', 'hand', 'waving', 'Polaroid', 'snapshot', 'wait', 'minute', 'photo', ""n't"", 'coming', 'focus', 'fading', 'away', 'are', 'going', 'backwards', 'scene', 'what', 'happened', 'preceding', 'scene', 'marvelous', 'way', 'edited', ""n't"", 'that', 'hard', 'follow', 'result', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'one', 'confusion', 'one', 'how', 'tricky', 'memory', 'can', 'be.The', 'protagonist', 'Leonard', '[', 'Guy', 'Pearce', ']', 'anterograde', 'memory', 'loss', 'condition', 'impossible', 'make', 'new', 'memories', 'condition', 'result', 'injury', 'received', 'night', 'wife', 'was', 'brutally', 'murdered', 'attempted', 'save', 'way', 'Now', 'quest', 'find', 'killer', 'almost', 'impossible', 'task', 'someone', 'wo', ""n't"", 'remember', 'doing', 'so', 'ten', 'minutes', 'later', 'someone', 'talks', 'too', 'long', 'wo', ""n't"", 'remember', 'first', 'conversation', 'easy', 'victimize', 'way', 'several', 'characters', 'who', 'do', 'just', 'same', 'time', 'slowly', 'begin', 'wonder', 'Leonard', 'fact', 'victim', 'something', 'not', 'quite', 'right', 'story.Leonard', 'long', 'term', 'memory', 'perfectly', 'intact', 'remember', 'everything', 'injury', 'methodical', 'personality', 'sorts', 'tricks', 'help', 'remember', 'things', 'now', 'constantly', 'notes', 'Polaroids', 'remind', 'who', 'met', 'where', 'been', 'even', 'so', 'far', 'have', 'pertinent', 'facts', 'tattooed', 'body', 'when', 'up', 'morning', 'will', 'remember', 'mission', 'important', 'note', 'Leonard', ""n't"", 'looking', 'justice', 'seeking', 'revenge.Guy', 'Pearce', 'stunning', 'Leonard', 'role', 'much', 'more', 'difficult', 'appear', 'be', 'must', 'create', 'empathy', 'understanding', 'character', 'who', 'condition', 'basically', 'personality', 'can', 'relate', 'How', 'do', 'relate', 'someone', 'who', 'never', 'ever', 'met', 'bond', 'could', 'never', 'exist', 'Pearce', 'make', 'care', 'Leonard.This', 'director', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'second', 'film', 'first', 'was', 'shot', 'video', 'black', 'white', 'so', 'obscure', ""'d"", 'be', 'hard', 'pressed', 'find', 'anyone', 'who', 'seen', 'Memento', 'be', 'promises', 'be', 'very', 'recognizable', 'creative', 'something', 'reassuring', 'movie', 'success', '[', 'People', ']', 'have', 'voted', 'Memento', 'number', 'eleven', '[', ']', 'site', 'list', 'best', 'movies', 'ever', 'made', 'might', 'not', 'rank', 'own', 'list', 'important', 'point', '12,000', 'votes', 'cast', 'came', 'people', 'twenty-five', 'years', 'old', 'group', 'rated', 'even', 'higher', 'older', 'voters', 'fact', 'kids', 'can', 'be', 'so', 'impressed', 'literate', 'intelligent', 'movie', 'special', 'effects', 'pop', 'music', 'soundtrack', 'something', 'others', 'Hollywood', 'should', 'pay', 'attention', 'Perhaps', 'business', 'would', 'be', 'well', 'served', 'more', 'movies', 'challenge', 'audiences']",Memento VHS

Virchow,"[9, 36]","Christopher Nolan directs this stunningly akward and rather destructable piece of, need I say- waste, about a man who's life changing accident leaves him with a memory disorder- in which he can only remember previously before this accident, but the present and everything afterwards just flies right over his head.  He is obcessed with trying to find John G, the man responsible for the murder of his wife.  Through taking pictures, writing notes to himself, and tatooing his body to remember things, this man's life gets more confusing as time goes on, because to him- time is nothing, and he can't really feel it.  THE MATRIX's Carrie Anne-Moss and Joe Pantoliono star with Guy Pearce in this deranged thriller.To start off, this plot is so confusing and holds so much, it relies on itself being so non-understandable to make the viewer think there actually is a plot going on.  The point of the film is basically to surpass as something very original, which it is, but the problem is that its originality makes no sense whatsoever.  Sometimes we never know at what point in the film we are because they are constantly flashing back to the past to try to show us an event that took place that (Guy Pearce) can't remember.  Carrie Anne-Moss plays the mistook Natalie, a beaten woman who is trying to help out Leonard (Pierce) solve this case.  There is so much strange build around each character, including the odd Teddy, another man who seems to stick around and pretend to be Lenny's friend.  The purposterous events that take place over and over- like Leonard waking up in the motel and wondering where he is, looking at himself in the mirror, and questioning who people are- even telling the same people over and over about his condition; it gets to the point where you are tired of hearing it.  You are ten times ahead of the film and where the characters are at that you want to just get over with the film.All of these events lead up to a wonderous conclusion, but the problem is that you can't understand it, and you keep thinking about the strangeness of it after it's over.  All of this is topped off with unique acting, disgusting language used constantly- of course because these people can do and say whatever they want to Leonard and he wouldn't remember it fifteen minutes later anyway.The cruelness of the film, to its nonsense plot, its characters, and audience is enough to plague the whole idea of motion pictures.  They are meant to entertain, not to poison the mind with film algebra that has no answer.  This technically skilled and wondrous film would work if only it knew when to stop itself, if it could understand the boundaries and tolerances of audiences.  The film is highly skilled with an edge to it that the audiences want, but it is overdone with originality that the film doesn't make any sense anymore.  If only the plot wasn't like playing catch, going back and forth, when instead it should be keeping us in an orderly fashion of the film's movement, we'd all be able to keep up with it.  But as Christopher Nolan has left it, it is a stand-alone which will pit the audience in brain-freeze and they'd rather go see Pootie Tang instead.",1,First Rate Nonsense.,1004832000,"11 4, 2001",2001,3175,"['Christopher', 'Nolan', 'stunningly', 'akward', 'rather', 'destructable', 'piece', 'need', 'say-', 'waste', 'man', 'who', 'life', 'changing', 'accident', 'leaves', 'memory', 'disorder-', 'can', 'only', 'remember', 'previously', 'accident', 'present', 'everything', 'afterwards', 'just', 'flies', 'right', 'head', 'obcessed', 'trying', 'find', 'John', 'G', 'man', 'responsible', 'murder', 'wife', 'taking', 'pictures', 'writing', 'notes', 'tatooing', 'body', 'remember', 'things', 'man', 'life', 'more', 'confusing', 'time', 'him-', 'time', 'nothing', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'feel', 'THE', 'MATRIX', 'Carrie', 'Anne-Moss', 'Joe', 'Pantoliono', 'star', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'deranged', 'thriller.To', 'start', 'plot', 'so', 'confusing', 'so', 'much', 'being', 'so', 'non-understandable', 'make', 'viewer', 'think', 'actually', 'plot', 'going', 'point', 'film', 'basically', 'surpass', 'something', 'very', 'original', 'problem', 'originality', 'sense', 'whatsoever', 'Sometimes', 'never', 'know', 'what', 'point', 'film', 'are', 'are', 'constantly', 'flashing', 'back', 'past', 'try', 'show', 'event', 'took', 'place', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'Carrie', 'Anne-Moss', 'mistook', 'Natalie', 'beaten', 'woman', 'who', 'trying', 'help', 'out', 'Leonard', 'Pierce', 'solve', 'case', 'so', 'much', 'strange', 'build', 'character', 'including', 'odd', 'Teddy', 'man', 'who', 'stick', 'around', 'pretend', 'be', 'Lenny', 'friend', 'purposterous', 'events', 'take', 'place', 'over-', 'Leonard', 'waking', 'up', 'motel', 'wondering', 'where', 'looking', 'mirror', 'questioning', 'who', 'people', 'are-', 'even', 'telling', 'same', 'people', 'condition', 'point', 'where', 'are', 'tired', 'hearing', 'are', 'ten', 'times', 'ahead', 'film', 'where', 'characters', 'are', 'want', 'just', 'get', 'over', 'film.All', 'events', 'lead', 'up', 'wonderous', 'conclusion', 'problem', 'ca', ""n't"", 'understand', 'keep', 'thinking', 'strangeness', 'over', 'topped', 'off', 'unique', 'acting', 'disgusting', 'language', 'used', 'constantly-', 'course', 'people', 'can', 'do', 'say', 'want', 'Leonard', 'would', ""n't"", 'remember', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'later', 'anyway.The', 'cruelness', 'film', 'nonsense', 'plot', 'characters', 'audience', 'enough', 'plague', 'whole', 'idea', 'motion', 'pictures', 'are', 'meant', 'entertain', 'not', 'poison', 'mind', 'film', 'algebra', 'answer', 'technically', 'skilled', 'wondrous', 'film', 'would', 'work', 'only', 'knew', 'when', 'stop', 'could', 'understand', 'boundaries', 'tolerances', 'audiences', 'film', 'highly', 'skilled', 'edge', 'audiences', 'want', 'overdone', 'originality', 'film', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'anymore', 'only', 'plot', 'was', ""n't"", 'like', 'playing', 'catch', 'going', 'back', 'forth', 'when', 'instead', 'should', 'be', 'keeping', 'orderly', 'fashion', 'film', 'movement', ""'d"", 'be', 'able', 'keep', 'up', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'left', 'stand-alone', 'will', 'pit', 'audience', 'brain-freeze', ""'d"", 'rather', 'go', 'see', 'Pootie', 'Tang', 'instead']",Memento VHS

I think many however, would admit [perhaps only to themselves] that this film goes up a few notches based primarily on the fact that it was such a sleeper and went mostly unrecognized by the movie-going public.If Memento had been promoted the way say...Minority Report had been, i.e., with showy appearances on Oprah and the evening talk-shows, I'm not sure it would be so critically acclaimed by every armchair movie buff [including yours truly of course].  Part of what made Memento so good was the surprise I had because I didn't have enormous expectations.  After seeing the film in the theater, I rented it and didn't feel nearly as enthusiastic the second time through; although I still think it's a very well written, directed, and acted film.I suppose it's just the nature of having a trick ending...the red herring isn't so persuasive when you know you're being had.  In short, I'm not sure this is the sort of film I'd really want to *own*.  Maybe if I had a friend over who'd never seen it, but even that's no fun really.  It's always better to get something neither of you have seen.  So, I'd say Memento is certainly worth seeing at least once and then a second time to accentuate the fact that you were completely duped the first time around, but apart from that, I'd pass on this as a purchase.I think I could write a nearly identical review for the Usual Suspects too.

First, (to my knowledge) PRISCILLA: QUEEN OF THE DESERT - He is very strange and absolutely wonderful in this film.  It has become one of my all time favorites! Next, (I saw him in)LA CONFIDENTIAL - ROCK!  He plays a little pain in the buns that you can't help  but love/hate. Then, RAVENOUS - Whoah!  This is a crazy, delicious film!  I recommend it to anyone with a stomach on the strong side, again he rocks!  NOW, my loves, MOMENTO!!!!!  YAHOOOOO!  He is awesome.  This is very near a one man show staring my favorite actor!  The others in this flick are great also, Carrie Anne Moss and Joe Pantoliano (both of Matrix fame.  But our Guy hits the bullseye with this in depth look at a human beings inner thoughts.  Everything about this film is intriguing and fresh.  From the way it is filmed to the way it makes you think.  Not to mention the moments you burst out laughing (who would have thunk it?).  I can honestly say this went into my best bin along with Priscilla: Queen of the Desert.  Next up (and I am far too pumped about) The Count of Monte Cristo.  not only does Guy seem to be in a great role but the other actors/actrices seem to be great.  Also, (and I thought I was dreaming this one) in March 02, The Time Machine!  I can't believe my favorite actor and one of my favorite old movies coliding into a new movie.

It makes the movie for me. The ending is incredibly sad and I feel for the main character every time I see it, even though I know what's going to happen.You also get a whole new spin on the story. While people can whine all they want about the backwards thing, the movie goes backwards because it has to. If you watched it in sequence, it really wouldn't have much emotional impact. So, the movie needs the gimmick. If that turns you off, you probably won't enjoy the movie. Go see the new Bond or something if you don't think you can handle a backwards-running movie. Don't get me wrong; it's done well, but some people will probably be lost right from the beginning.Lastly, it's not all flash and no substance. Great performances all around, and the whole Sammy Jenkis story is really interesting and works well grounding the viewer between the backwards scenes. As for this DVD set, it's not that great. The commentary is boring; Nolan keeps justifying the backwards structure, but someone should've told him that the majority of the people who will listen to the commentary already agree with him and would rather hear about something else. The menus, as fun as some people might find them, are an utter waste of my time. If I wanted mind games, Chris, I'd move back in with my parents.

541931,A2DGSWAKU0VB4P,B00003CXZ3,Michael Clarkson,"[3, 3]","I'm writing specifically to respond to the numerous people who thought that this movie's structure was &quot;contrived&quot; to hide a weak plot. It's often been said that there are just a few distinct plots that arise repeatedly in all literature (I think it might have been something like ten). What differentiates a great story from a terrible story, then, is the attention to detail, the characterization, and the degree to which we are convinced of the story's reality. In short, it is not the story being told but rather the *way* in which it is being told that makes great literature... and great movies.In this respect, _Memento_ is a masterpiece. Far from being a pretentious contrivance developed in order to cultivate an arthouse atmosphere, the story's disjointed structure serves to convey Leonard's own disorientation and paranoia, his sense of having an idea what he's about to do, but not knowing what he's just done. Indeed, this structure is about the only way in which that feeling *could* be effectively communicated. The scripting and execution throughout the movie are flawless, and the acting is superb. Joe Pantoliano should top everyone's list for best supporting actor, and Carrie-Anne Moss and Guy Pearce also turn in Oscar-worthy nods. The story itself, presented in forward order, may not be the greatest ever written. However, the way in which the story is presented, and the philosophical explorations it takes along the way, make this a superb movie.",5,The plot is not the point,1004400000,"10 30, 2001",2001,1482,"[""'m"", 'writing', 'specifically', 'respond', 'numerous', 'people', 'who', 'thought', 'movie', 'structure', 'was', 'quot', 'contrived', 'quot', 'hide', 'weak', 'plot', 'often', 'been', 'said', 'are', 'just', 'few', 'distinct', 'plots', 'arise', 'repeatedly', 'literature', 'think', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'something', 'ten', 'What', 'great', 'story', 'terrible', 'story', 'then', 'attention', 'detail', 'characterization', 'degree', 'are', 'convinced', 'story', 'reality', 'short', 'not', 'story', 'being', 'told', 'rather', '*way*', 'being', 'told', 'great', 'literature', 'great', 'movies.In', 'respect', '_Memento_', 'masterpiece', 'Far', 'being', 'pretentious', 'contrivance', 'developed', 'order', 'cultivate', 'arthouse', 'atmosphere', 'story', 'disjointed', 'structure', 'convey', 'Leonard', 'own', 'disorientation', 'paranoia', 'sense', 'having', 'idea', 'what', 'do', 'not', 'knowing', 'what', 'just', 'done', 'Indeed', 'structure', 'only', 'way', 'feeling', '*could*', 'be', 'effectively', 'communicated', 'scripting', 'execution', 'movie', 'are', 'flawless', 'acting', 'superb', 'Joe', 'Pantoliano', 'should', 'top', 'everyone', 'list', 'best', 'supporting', 'actor', 'Carrie-Anne', 'Moss', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'also', 'turn', 'Oscar-worthy', 'nods', 'story', 'presented', 'forward', 'order', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'greatest', 'ever', 'written', 'However', 'way', 'story', 'presented', 'philosophical', 'explorations', 'way', 'make', 'superb', 'movie']",Memento VHS

Now, you can get the special edition of ""Memento,"" which is loaded with tons of cool features and extras.  Not only that, but the movie is also remastered, both in picture and sound.  Is this special edition worth getting?  You betcha!The picture quality is outstanding!  It's hard to believe that this is a low-budget film.  Somebody wrote a review claiming that this wasn't in widescreen.  I don't know what kind of version that person got, but the one I bought is very much widescreen, so don't let that throw you off track.  To have this movie be presented in full screen would be a crime!  I also noticed how much better the sound quality is.  I haven't had a chance to watch it in DTS, but I'm sure the quality is top-notch.Before the special features, a little recap of what the movie is about for those who are new to this movie.  Leonard Shelby has a condition.  He has no short term memory.  Everything fades for him.  If he talks to someone for too long he'll forget who that person is and what they were talking about.  Ten or twenty minutes later he'll have no recollection of what happened earlier on.  The twist: he's looking for the man who raped and murdered his wife.  Now, Leonard is armed to the teeth with important tattoos to help him remember important info, and is also armed with a camera to take pictures of those who he encounters.  He only lives for revenge, wanting to find the identity of a killer he can't possibly ever know for sure.  The second twist is that the movie is told in REVERSE order.  So, be warned; this is not a movie you can just sit down and eat your popcorn and relax.  This is a movie that forces you to think.Now the special features; there's tons of them.  You get to hear director commentary, which is very cool.  On the second disk is where all of the special features lie, but you can't just click on them.  OH NO!  You've got to work to earn them.  Solve brain teasers and puzzles and answer questions very much like a psychological test.  Very cool!  If you're a fan of the movie, you won't mind the work.  Some of the features are a behind the scenes feature, two trailers, pictures, the short story by Nolan's brother, Leonard's journal, and more.  And there are hidden features I have yet to find.  But I did find one that I think will interest you very much.  Know what it is?  Do you?  Yes, there is a way to watch the movie in CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER!!!  It's hidden, so it's not an option you can just select.  It's pretty easy to do.NOTE: IF YOU WANT TO DISCOVER THE FEATURE FOR YOURSELF, DO NOT READ THE NEXT PARAGRAPH!!Here's what you do: 1)make sure the second disk is in. 2)click on the clock image that is below the gun. 3)answer the series of questions anyway you please; when in doubt, go with ""C."" 4)you'll be asked to put four images in chronological order instead, put them in BACKWARDS order. 5)need help? here's the order: third image, fourth image, first image, and then the second image. 6)movie will begin to play in chronological order. congrats! enjoy!I was very pleased with this special edition of ""Memento.""  It was like watching it for the very first time.  If you're a big fan of the movie, then get it as soon as you can.  You will not regret it.  I know I didn't.

Confidental, The count of monte crisco)Joe Pantiliano(The Matrix, The sopranos television series) and Carrie Anne Moss(The Matrix).Gur pearse is a man who has no short term memory, so he cant remember anything past 15 minutes.To remembe things, he takes pictures, wirties notes on them and also get tattos on his body.Joe Pantiliano plays a man who is friends with guy pearse, but you never truly know who he is.Finally Carrie Anne Moss plays a mysterious women, who doesnt turn out to be who she really is.The plot of the movie is that guy pearse is trying to find out who murdered his wife.Sounds simple right?Well its not.

You all know the story, and if you don't, read the other reviews here. I was fortunate enough to pick up the DVD of this movie I had seen 6 times earlier a week before its release. The disc is produced nicely--the menus show us a portion of the &quot;first&quot; scene, in forward playback for the first time. Teddy's backwards cry is heard often, and at one point (I don't know how/why this happened) the order of &quot;Play Movie/Subtitles/Scene Selections/Special Features&quot; became &quot;Special Features/Scene Selections/Subtitles/Play Movie&quot;, and pressing down brought me up and pressing up brought me down. There is also a nice 20 minute interview from IFC with Christopher Nolan, as well as the movie's entire website. There's a nice little tattoo gallery as well. The disc only gets 4 out of 5, however, because it lacks an audio commentary, and also lacks what could be the most original special feature imaginable--a reworked edit of the film.

The problem with this is that many of these individuals don't really know what to look for in a good film, and only say that movies deserve Oscars because others told them so. Think about it...if The Lord of the Rings or A Beautiful Mind for that matter, flopped at the box office, would it be as highly recognized? The problem is, the Academy is just like these people, and refuse to use their brains or form their own opinions about movies. Which is why Memento, and many other movies of its kind are far too often over-looked by the dull, uneducated masses.Yes, when you watch Memento you do have to *gasp* think! Oh, what a concept! If you are one of the few individuals who enjoys a film that challenges them, and makes them question their own opinions about themselves and the world around them, you will fall in love with this film.The movie opens with Leanord Shelby (Guy Pearce) killing the man who raped and murdered his wife. Or at least, the man who he thinks raped and murdered his wife. The conflict throughout the film is Leanord's inability to make new memories. Everything, as Leanord so aptly describes it, fades. The film's first scene is the last scene in chronological sequence and the film is stacked so that from there it plays out backwards so that the audience can properly identify with Leanord's illness. Leanord is desperately trying to find his wife's killer, and along the way meets some new friends (Teddy: Joe Pantoliano and Natalie:  Carrie-Ann Moss). Or are they enemies? We are never quite sure until the very end, and along the way, we are desperately trying to piece together Leanord's life, as is he. Leanord is obsessed with finding the man who destroyed his life, and it is something that he can never forget, for it is the very last thing he can remember. One of the saddest and most powerful points in the film comes when Natalie asks Leanord what the last thing he can  remember is. He replies, ""My wife..."" Natalie comments on how sweet that is until Leanord cuts her off with, ""...dying."" It is moments like these that make Memento one of the most brilliant films ever created, and I highly recommend it to anybody looking for a challenging and incredibly involving film experience.The Limited Edition 2-disc DVD is well worth it, also, as it is loaded with extras and contains a thought-provoking and extremely creative menu format.",5,One of the Best Films I've Ever Seen,1041465600,"01 2, 2003",2003,2470,"['Far', 'too', 'many', 'times', 'have', 'heard', 'people', 'praising', 'pretentious', 'high-budget', 'films', '2001', 'problem', 'many', 'individuals', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'know', 'what', 'look', 'good', 'film', 'only', 'say', 'movies', 'deserve', 'Oscars', 'others', 'told', 'so', 'Think', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'A', 'Beautiful', 'Mind', 'matter', 'flopped', 'box', 'office', 'would', 'be', 'highly', 'recognized', 'problem', 'Academy', 'just', 'people', 'refuse', 'use', 'brains', 'form', 'own', 'opinions', 'movies', 'Which', 'why', 'Memento', 'many', 'other', 'movies', 'kind', 'are', 'far', 'too', 'often', 'over-looked', 'dull', 'uneducated', 'masses.Yes', 'when', 'watch', 'Memento', 'do', 'have', '*gasp*', 'think', 'Oh', 'what', 'concept', 'are', 'one', 'few', 'individuals', 'who', 'film', 'question', 'own', 'opinions', 'world', 'will', 'fall', 'love', 'film.The', 'movie', 'Leanord', 'Shelby', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'killing', 'man', 'who', 'raped', 'murdered', 'wife', 'least', 'man', 'who', 'raped', 'murdered', 'wife', 'conflict', 'film', 'Leanord', 'inability', 'make', 'new', 'memories', 'Everything', 'Leanord', 'so', 'aptly', 'film', 'first', 'scene', 'last', 'scene', 'chronological', 'sequence', 'film', 'stacked', 'so', 'out', 'backwards', 'so', 'audience', 'can', 'properly', 'identify', 'Leanord', 'illness', 'Leanord', 'desperately', 'trying', 'find', 'wife', 'killer', 'way', 'new', 'friends', 'Teddy', 'Joe', 'Pantoliano', 'Natalie', 'Carrie-Ann', 'Moss', 'are', 'enemies', 'are', 'never', 'quite', 'sure', 'very', 'end', 'way', 'are', 'desperately', 'trying', 'piece', 'together', 'Leanord', 'life', 'Leanord', 'obsessed', 'finding', 'man', 'who', 'destroyed', 'life', 'something', 'can', 'never', 'forget', 'very', 'last', 'thing', 'can', 'remember', 'One', 'saddest', 'most', 'powerful', 'points', 'film', 'when', 'Natalie', 'Leanord', 'what', 'last', 'thing', 'can', 'remember', 'wife', 'Natalie', 'comments', 'how', 'sweet', 'Leanord', 'off', 'dying', 'moments', 'make', 'Memento', 'one', 'most', 'brilliant', 'films', 'ever', 'created', 'highly', 'recommend', 'anybody', 'looking', 'challenging', 'incredibly', 'involving', 'film', 'experience.The', 'Limited', 'Edition', '2-disc', 'DVD', 'well', 'worth', 'also', 'loaded', 'extras', 'thought-provoking', 'extremely', 'creative', 'menu', 'format']",Memento VHS

541942,A1D1MIFRSG50Y3,B00003CXZ3,Mike S.,"[1, 1]","This movie came out before Christopher Nolan was a household name.  It was a relatively low budget film that is part revenge story, part drama, part dark comedy and part love story.  The basic plot is that a man is looking for his wife's killer, but because of a head injury he cannot make new short term memories.  He remembers everything up to his accident, but becomes a blank slate every few minutes.  As a result he takes Polaroids of the people he interacts with, writes notes to himself and tattoos clues onto his body.  The twist is that the movie is shown in reverse.  You get a scene, then it will roll back about 5 min or so, and show the events leading up to what you just watched.  And keeps doing that throughout the entire movie.While the writing and directing are great, the key to the movie being as good as it is was the acting.  Guy Pearce as the main character, Lenny/Leonard does a great job both when he is narrating the rules for his life, and when he is onscreen.  Joe Pantoliano and Carrie-Anne Moss both having come off making the original Matrix film when this came out are great playing characters that are much more than they seem.  What you find out by the end/beginning of the movie is that all the characters are pretty morally gray.As far as extras go there on the blu ray there are about 25 min worth of behind the scenes material.  Commentary on the film from Nolan, a copy of the script, a gallery showing the various clues tattooed on Leonard and his diary.  Not a ton of material but good for what it there.Most likely anyone reading this by now will have already seen the movie, but it not it is definitely worth checking out.  It is much more like Inception than it is the Dark Knight movies, but to the extent you can say Nolan has a style, it definitely follows it.

It's much more complex than that. Sure, part of the narrative moves in reverse chronological order, beginning with the end and moving backwards. But another part moves swiftly forward, starting from the traditional beginning. And then there are a series of flashbacks, which jump back and forth willy-nilly through time. It all culminates somewhere in the middle, the various narratives intersecting with a truly satisfying twist.Those who describe &quot;Memento&quot;s narrative structure as simply an attention-grabbing gimmick are doing the film a disservice. Sure, it's a unique take on a standard film-noirish detective story. But I'd reason that the &quot;gimmick&quot; provides much of the suspense in the story. We know that Leonard kills Teddy in the film's opening scene, but we don't know why. We assume he's got the right man, but the slinky narrative forces us to question everything that we would normally assume. And the twist ending (which really takes place in the middle) would not have nearly the shock appeal if we hadn't already suffered along with Leonard throughout the course of the picture. Our emotional investment in him helps create the exhilarating moment when the curtain is pulled back and we really see who's pulling the levers.  I was grinning wildly at this point, impressed that the filmmakers managed to catch me off guard.Those who describe &quot;Memento&quot;s acting ensemble as anything other than spectacular are doing the film a disservice.  Guy Pearce is laid back, stylish, and cool, even when caught in the midst of a hazardous situation.  He's seen it all before (even if he doesn't really remember it), and that world-weariness is worn well in his role as a typical film noir anti-hero.  He's also a fine example of the post-modern unreliable narrator.  This convention, which works well when utilized in literature, is a tough feat to pull off in film, for the audience sees what the character sees instead of being told about it.  The film's unique structure subverts this point, and Pearce is left carrying the load of exposition.  He does it well.  Joe Pantoliano, as Teddy, sports a cheesy moustache and crewcut, and gets to lurk suspiciously after Leonard even while he's playing as if the two are friends.  Pantoliano imbues Teddy with hidden wisdom and cunning, wrapped up in a package that would intimidate no one.  Carrie-Ann Moss, as the typical moll, does well in bringing out her character's street smarts and savviness.  She appears to be in Leonard's corner, but Moss allows just enough doubt to keep her character intriguing.  The rest of the cast appears too briefly for any solid judgement.  Too bad, because Canadian boy Callum Keith Rennie, hee playing a vindictive drug dealer, is a fine actor who could have done much more than what he was given.Those who describe &quot;Memento&quot;s writer/director as amateurish are doing the film a disservice.  I found Christopher Nolan's work to be relaxed and assured.  He'd have to be in order to keep the various narrative balls juggled in the air.  A movie like this is ripe for continuity goofs and inconsistencies.  After a couple of days contemplation, I can't find any.  And all this while keeping the suspense tight, the story moving, the visuals appealing and perfectly symbolic.  And even though he does his best to keep the audience up to speed, he never panders to the lowest common denominator by providing easy answers.  &quot;Memento&quot; is a movie that you can't watch passively.

541945,A27RJ30RN5K9MX,B00003CXZ3,Mitch Weaver,"[4, 5]","The film focuses on a man named Leonard Shelby ( Guy Pierce). He is obsessed with finding his wife's killer. On the night his wife was killed, he gets his head knocked while attempting to save her. This causes him to develop a condition. Leonard can only remember everything that happened up until the night of his wife's murder. He cannot make new memories, and forgets everything five minutes after it happens. This forces him to live a life based on a endless supply of notes, poloroids, and tatoos that he puts all over his body. We are introduced to the two main people in his life - Teddy ( Joe Pantoliano) and Natalie ( Carrie Ann Moss). Both claim to be a friend to him, but things are not as they seem. Both Teddy and Natalie have personal reasons behind wanting to help Leonard. Now Leonard must not only track down his wife's killer and deal with his condition, but he must also determine who's friend, and who's foe.I am a sucker for a good mystery, and &quot;Memento&quot; is the most original and well executed mystery film that I have ever seen. The story is suspenseful and extremely complex. I love how Christopher Nolan had the film unfold in reverse. You come to feel very frustrated over the course of the film. However, that is also why the story is brilliant. You find yourself starting to feel exactly how Leonard does. This actually involves you in the film personally, and makes you sympathize for Leonard overall. The film's focus keeps switching back and forth between Leonard's search for the killer, and flashbacks into Leonard's prior life as an insurance investigator and his big case with a man named Sammy Jenkis ( Stephen Tobolowsky). I loved this aspect of the film, because Sammy suffers from the same condition as Leonard's. &quot;Memento&quot; is also guaranteed to keep you guessing. The film continually dangles clues in front of you. But since the story is told in reverse, what you are seeing, may not be what it seems! The film could not have succeeded without the performances given from the sctors. Guy Pierce's portrayal of Leonard is one of the best that I have ever seen. It is so realistic, and so convincing, that you come to believe that Guy Pearce actually went through the same thing himself. The fact that he made such a difficult role look so easy, still amazes me to this day. Joe Pantoliano and Carrie Ann Moss are also great. Their performances add to the film's suspense, because you never know what to believe.Christopher Nolan's &quot;Memento&quot; is amazing. The film has great acting, a nice script, an intense, complex story, and an outstanding ending. The limited edition DVD only adds to the already flawless film. This 2 disc limited edition DVD is great because there are mindbenders and challenges you have to go through to get to the film. That brings the meaning of the word &quot;interactive&quot; to a whole new level!

Fowler ""ben1283""","[1, 1]","Considering the undeniably interesting and original premise (guy with no short term memory goes in search of wife's killer) and the film's rave reviews, its perhaps surprising that this film didn't do better.  But then again it didn't contain Hollywood superstars, and before anyone mentions Blair Witch, a hugely successful (and fake!) marketting scheme.  More importantly, it's an adults' movie, which of course means that it can never be a box office success.  Although maybe those times are changing with 'American Beauty' and 'Magnolia' doing so well.Anyway, the movie itself is told backwards.  Here the end is the beginning, the audience gets to see who Pearce took his vengeance out upon, and we backtrack to the beginning to find out the real conclusion.  This twist is ingenious, but makes for frustrating viewing as you try to grasp what's going on whilst watching the action at the same time.  This is a must-see-twice movie if ever there was one.  The acting from every quarter is wonderful, hopefully setting up Guy Pearce as a major star .  Come on Hollywood, the rest of the stars of 'L.A Confidential' are doing well!  Carrie-Ann Moss proves that there's more to her than rubber suits and special effects and Pantoliano gives a magnificent turn as Teddy.So what makes the movie special?  Well, it's intelligent for one.  There's a neat little subplot that tugs at the heart strings.  Plus the director manages to extend empathy towards all of his miserable characters, imbuing them with life rather than using his supporting cast as mere cardboard cut-outs to help make the lead look good.  But what is the film about?  Any number of things really.  It challenges its audience's ideas of memory and its reliability as well as showing just how bland and easily forgettable most of today's movie fodder is.

541955,A1HAL6ZQ8MUJSD,B00003CXZ3,mr_bunghole,"[7, 7]","Everybody can now take a deep breath; it turns out Hollywood still has a few tricks up its sleeve.  In an age of brain-dead cookie-cutter action flicks and puerile teen &quot;comedies&quot;, it's rare to see a film that flexes its creative muscle and does something new and relevant with motion picture.  Christopher Nolan's suspense thriller Memento does precisely this, and it's a wonderful experience.  The protagonist is Leonard Shelby (played with quiet intensity by Guy Pearce), a former insurance salesman who tries to hunt down the man who murdered his wife and inflicted brain damage on him.  The problem is that he suffers from anterograde amnesia - that is, he remembers everything before the attack, but is unable to make new memories.  He investigates the crime by writing  himself notes, taking polaroids of his peers and tattooing his body.  The movie is sequenced starting with the final events and works its way backward in the colour scenes.  The black and white scenes, however, are chronologically sequenced, with the two types of scenes meeting at the end.  The effect may be disorienting for the first couple of scenes, but it turns out to be much more than just a novelty.  This structure is integral in slowly revealing small surprises leading up to the expected revelation at the end.  The viewer is constantly paying close attention in finding clues to determine who is helping Leonard and who is setting him up.  Not since The Usual Suspects has a thriller commanded the audience to pay such attention to detail.  The multifaceted and often manipulative supporting characters keep the viewer on his/her toes;  the terrific performances by Carrie-Ann Moss (Natalie) and especially Joe Pantoliano (Teddy) do a wonderful job justifying the dubious level of trust that Leonard experiences.  Helpful advice - pay special attention to their body language.  The film is a grim commentary at how we often trivialize our remarkable capabilities; the tragic consequence of Sammy Jankis' condition particularly demonstrates the value of our ability to form memories - which we often take for granted.  What makes this film so relevant is that it refuses to settle for a simple, generic whodunit, using its innovative structure to build a tapestry of clues and characters, and also to &quot;put the audience in Leonard's shoes.&quot;  It is a film that tempts - some would argue that it requires - repeated viewings, and promotes active discussion long after the credits roll.  Most of all, it stimulates the mind without losing sight that a movie should also be entertaining.

Carnegie,"[1, 1]","Guy Pearce gives an excellent performance as Leonard Shelby, a man trying to find the people who brutally raped and murdered his wife and left him unable to make new memories, in this complex thriller told backwards by writer-director Christopher Nolan.Because of his condition Leonard has to continually keep notes, on paper, with polaroids but also with tattoos and notes written on his body, as his only ways of retaining any new information. From day to day he has to rely on his notes to remind him of his progress and trust that they are correct. His life is permanently lived in present-tense and his only purpose is to find those responsible for his wife's murder.What makes this movie really intriguing and keeps you on the edge of your seat is the fact that the story is told from the end backwards, each segment of the movie revealing a little bit more of what has previously happened. Who is a friend who is an enemy? This is what keeps you interested, this what keeps you guessing. I saw this movie at the theatre and what made it a great movie first time, apart from the excellent story and excellent acting from all concerned, is the surprise element and whilst if you are watching this movie for the first time it really is a rewarding experience, my concern with buying it on DVD, is that like many great thrillers it's maybe not so good for repeated viewings. Despite the fact that it is undoubtedly excellently crafted and has top notch performances from Guy Pearce, Joe Pantoliano and Carrie Anne Moss, it's the intrigue that holds the movie together and hold it together it does very well, for this is an excellent, very intelligent movie. I just feel that once you know the end of the movie (the beginning of the story) it might not hold the same allure (or your attention) second or third time around. If you haven't seen it though and you like slow-burn, complex, intelligent thrillers, this comes highly recommended and will hopefully bring Guy Pearce an Oscar nomination.

My opinion is the less you know about this film the more enjoyable it is in solving the riddles. So if you haven't seen it stop reading this review and go watch the movie.The movies main theme consist of perceptions vs. reality and how the two only briefly come into contact with one another. Our protagonist Lenny, played excellently by Guy Pierce, has a peculiar memory lose condition, and we are forced to relate to his inability (and unwillingness) to face what he already subconsciously knows.  But we don't know that at the time and neither does he. Confusing, I know.In order to give the viewer a sense of Lenny's (he hates it when you call him that) confusion over his memory condition the film is played backwards so that in each scene we are confronted with no memory of the preceding events, left only with clues that must be put together.We journey with Lenny the investigator and try to put the pieces together but he ultimately leaves out a key element: his own motives for not wanting to know the truth. The reason for this is that  Lenny instinctively knows that even a terrible purpose is better than no purpose at all, and should he solve the mystery he will be left as a mindless mental patient.Basically Lenny, with the help of &quot;Teddy&quot;, are building a mystery using the truth as model for their deceptions.The black and white scenes give the movie a truly nice touch that threw cleverly threw me off the scent.The DVD also has an excellent bonus, the original short story that the movie was based on.

Durham ""Big Evil""","[11, 13]","Before Christopher Nolan would be tapped to direct a remake of 2002's Insomnia, he directed this modest budgeted thriller that sets bold new standards in mystery and suspense cinema.  Guy Pearce (Ravenous) plays a man named Leonard Shelby who is searching for the man that raped and murdered his wife.  That alone is pretty much the plot, but what sets Memento apart from other revenge themed thrillers is the fact that the film moves backwards event wise.  The film starts out from the end and works it's way back to the beginning, letting the viewer find out not just how something happened, but why it happened.  Memento is presented in this form due to the fact that Leonard suffers from a condition received when his wife was attacked that stops his brain from making new memories.  Lenny can't remember faces, names, locations, or anything else on his own so he takes Polaroid photos, writes endless amounts of organized notes, and even makes himself home made tattoos.  Pearce is simply unbelieveable in his role as the tortured soul Lenny, while Joe Pantoliano (The Matrix, tv's The Sopranos) almost steals Pearce's thunder as Teddy, a man who may or may not be on Lenny's side.  Carrie-Anne Moss (another Matrix alumnus) plays a sympathetic soul to Lenny's crisis while hiding ulterior motives, and she gives a knockout performance as well.  Memento requires more than one viewing to fully understand the complex storyline, but once you do you'll be left with your jaw on the floor.

Our main character, Leanard(Guy Pearce) lost his short term memory one night, when two unidentified bandits invaded his home and allegedly killed his wife.  Leonard managed to gun down one of the bandits, but was pushed into a mirror by the other, knocking him out and taking away his capability to form new memories.  His motive is simple:  Find and kill his wife's killer.When we first meet Leonard, he is well aware of his condition and knows pretty well how to deal with it---or so we think.  He is constantly on the look out for those that might want to take advantage of him and is not trusting of anyone.  He takes pictures of place, people and thing and jots down notes on them to jog his memory.The first scene in the film is Leornard gunning down the man whom he is hunting for the rest of the film.  The rest of the movie goes backwards, explaining how Leonard came to the conclusion that the man he shoots at the start, was the second bandit involved in his wife's murder.This movie is exceptionally well shot on film and very captivating.

This seems to be the case for Guy Pierce as he tries to solve the raping/murder of his wife.  His only problem:  He is unable to form new memories.  The people who are out to help Pierce in his quest are Matrix alums Carrie Anne-Moss and Joe Pantoliano.  The genius of this film lies in it's directing.  To get the idea of being unable to hold a memory for more than 5 minutes the story is told BACKWARDS in 5 minute increments.  That way you piece things together just as he does.

541970,A12FLZREV32JOP,B00003CXZ3,Noelle Eiram,"[5, 7]","'Memento' is a very well made film. The main character Leonard makes genuinely surprising discoveries throughout his search for the man who murdered his wife. This is a revenge movie in which I actually felt sympathy for the protagonist, for, though 'Memento' is primarily a thriller, it does not gloss over the sorrow Leonard feels about his wife. Unfortunately, Leonard is also very confused and vulnerable because the man who killed Leonard's wife also injured Lenny in the head, causing him to have very short short term memory. One of the main themes of 'Memento' is how crummy people are - and how people will manipulate each other at any chance they get.'Memento' is famous for being told ""backward"". One thread plays forward, another, which involves most of the action in the story, works backward, scene by scene. It works well, and is more than a gimmick. The climax is neither predictable nor over the top, and is one of the best I have seen in a while.The acting is astounding, particularly by Carrie Ann Moss. As her character gradually unfolds, the viewer sees the greatly varied facets of her personality. Joe Palantino is an excellent actor, and he is perfectly cast as an untrustworthy but seemingly helpful cop. Guy Pearce successfully plays Leonard Shelby, who is alternately lost, driven, disciplined, and frazzled. Each main character is sympathetic in some way but has a supremely unpleasant streak.Due to its intricate plot, carefully attended details, and complex character motives, 'Memento' holds up on repeated viewings.

541982,A2X44AITMRTNC4,B00003CXZ3,Paul Fucich,"[5, 6]","The first part of this review is for those who have not seen this film. The second part is specifically for those who have viewed this film more than once.In this first part I will mention that this film is highly unusual. Even a description of the plot and characters would only be my abstract and subjective opinion. You the viewer, are the final judge as to what actually took place within the story. This movie is that obscure, intricate, illusive, and downright subjective. This is not (not at all) the type of movie that you go into viewing with preconceived ideas--whatever they may be. If you are the type of person who just has to know about a movie before you even watch it, you are doing yourself a grave disservice in this case. Exercise your mind and your comprehension skills and view this film without any foreknowledge, other than the fact that you are in for a special dosage of mental stimulation.I would recommend this film to anyone who enjoys being intellectually challenged. Those of you who are intuitive and sensitive to subtleties, those of you who notice things that others overlook, and those of you who are clever and inventive will love this movie. Detectives, medical professionals, psychologists, sociologists, scientists, mathematicians, and creative professionals, such as writers, will find this film very rewarding.This is certainly the type of film that you will want in DVD. You will have questions that only the extras on the DVD can answer for you. There is also a website set up specifically for admirers of this fantastic movie. If after watching, you can figure out the website address, you are very clever.In this second part I would like to discuss my opinion of what I  believe is an overlooked aspect of the plot and the main character, Leonard. If you think I am on to something, than e-mail me.I have many ideas about how to interpret this film, however I am going to give a very unusual interpretation here, in hopes that there are others out there that, like me, like to think ""out side the box"", so to speak.The way I see it, Leonard is a person who loves to kill. He has been killing prior to meeting this person he refers to as his wife, who is actually not his wife. He uses his memory condition as a contributor to his psychological dysfunction (his need to kill).  He remembers what he needs to remember, and forgets just what he needs to forget. Leonard displays both sociopathic and psychopathic behavior. He surrounds himself with abusive, aggressive individuals who fuel his justification for his heinous actions. Leonard is extremely clever and intelligent, and he is disciplined and systematic to a precision.Leonard was committed to a mental institution prior to meeting his supposed wife--whom he also killed.  There is special meaning to the one tattoo that Leonard can see at all times, ""Remember Sammy Jenkis,"" and it is not because Leonard is Sammy. It is because Sammy is the first person Leonard killed, prior to his incarceration at the mental institution, as this is Leonard's reminder of his purpose in life as a killer. And the real kicker is that Leonard would have everyone believe that his memory condition is a physical handicap, when in fact it is a mental projection produced by his severe psychosis.And the beauty of this film is that it does not matter if my opinions are near fact or far fetched, what matters is that this film allows me to create what reality I would have with it.",5,A Review In Two Parts,1002499200,"10 8, 2001",2001,3465,"['first', 'part', 'review', 'who', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'film', 'second', 'part', 'specifically', 'who', 'have', 'viewed', 'film', 'more', 'once.In', 'first', 'part', 'will', 'mention', 'film', 'highly', 'unusual', 'Even', 'description', 'plot', 'characters', 'would', 'only', 'be', 'abstract', 'subjective', 'opinion', 'viewer', 'are', 'final', 'judge', 'what', 'actually', 'took', 'place', 'story', 'movie', 'obscure', 'intricate', 'illusive', 'downright', 'subjective', 'not', 'not', 'type', 'movie', 'go', 'viewing', 'preconceived', 'ideas', 'may', 'be', 'are', 'type', 'person', 'who', 'just', 'know', 'movie', 'even', 'watch', 'are', 'doing', 'grave', 'disservice', 'case', 'Exercise', 'mind', 'comprehension', 'skills', 'view', 'film', 'foreknowledge', 'other', 'fact', 'are', 'special', 'dosage', 'mental', 'stimulation.I', 'would', 'recommend', 'film', 'anyone', 'who', 'being', 'intellectually', 'challenged', 'who', 'are', 'intuitive', 'sensitive', 'subtleties', 'who', 'notice', 'things', 'others', 'overlook', 'who', 'are', 'clever', 'inventive', 'will', 'love', 'movie', 'Detectives', 'medical', 'professionals', 'psychologists', 'sociologists', 'scientists', 'mathematicians', 'creative', 'professionals', 'such', 'writers', 'will', 'find', 'film', 'very', 'rewarding.This', 'certainly', 'type', 'film', 'will', 'want', 'DVD', 'will', 'have', 'questions', 'only', 'extras', 'DVD', 'can', 'answer', 'also', 'website', 'set', 'up', 'specifically', 'admirers', 'fantastic', 'movie', 'watching', 'can', 'figure', 'out', 'website', 'address', 'are', 'very', 'clever.In', 'second', 'part', 'would', 'like', 'discuss', 'opinion', 'what', 'believe', 'overlooked', 'aspect', 'plot', 'main', 'character', 'Leonard', 'think', 'am', 'something', 'e-mail', 'me.I', 'have', 'many', 'ideas', 'how', 'interpret', 'film', 'however', 'am', 'going', 'give', 'very', 'unusual', 'interpretation', 'here', 'hopes', 'are', 'others', 'there', 'think', 'side', 'box', 'so', 'speak.The', 'way', 'see', 'Leonard', 'person', 'who', 'kill', 'been', 'killing', 'prior', 'meeting', 'person', 'wife', 'who', 'actually', 'not', 'wife', 'memory', 'condition', 'contributor', 'psychological', 'dysfunction', 'need', 'kill', 'what', 'remember', 'just', 'what', 'forget', 'Leonard', 'sociopathic', 'psychopathic', 'behavior', 'abusive', 'aggressive', 'individuals', 'who', 'fuel', 'justification', 'heinous', 'actions', 'Leonard', 'extremely', 'clever', 'intelligent', 'disciplined', 'systematic', 'precision.Leonard', 'was', 'committed', 'mental', 'institution', 'prior', 'meeting', 'supposed', 'wife', 'whom', 'also', 'killed', 'special', 'meaning', 'one', 'tattoo', 'Leonard', 'can', 'see', 'times', 'Remember', 'Sammy', 'Jenkis', 'not', 'Leonard', 'Sammy', 'Sammy', 'first', 'person', 'Leonard', 'killed', 'prior', 'incarceration', 'mental', 'institution', 'Leonard', 'reminder', 'purpose', 'life', 'killer', 'real', 'kicker', 'Leonard', 'would', 'have', 'everyone', 'believe', 'memory', 'condition', 'physical', 'handicap', 'when', 'fact', 'mental', 'projection', 'produced', 'severe', 'psychosis.And', 'beauty', 'film', 'not', 'matter', 'opinions', 'are', 'near', 'fact', 'far', 'fetched', 'what', 'film', 'create', 'what', 'reality', 'would', 'have']",Memento VHS

Memento is Nolan's second film and is the first film in cinema history to be told backwards. This film is based on his brother's (at that time) unpublished short story he was telling him on a trip to chicago. Although not an exact adaptation of the story, it is based on the ideas and backdrop of the short story.Guy Pearce play's the poor soul Leanard Shelby, who has a condition he suffers that is bassicly short term memory loss. So in other words he doesn't have the ability to create new memories. The only reason why lenny is still living is his desire to revenge his murdered whife's death, which is the only thing he can remember last, his wife dying. Due to his condition he has to make notes of the clues to finding his wifes murderer and rapist. All the clues to his wifes killer are tattood on his body, and all things he needs to know are on pollaroid photo's that tell him where he's staying and who's helping him get his revenge. The film bassicly starts from the end and works it's way to the beggining which is the end of the film. I don't want to spoil anymore of the movie so it is up to you to figure the clues out.This film should've taken home the oscars for best screenplay and editing for very good reasons, Christopher Nolan had to start with the end and work his way backwards, same goes for the editing. The performances are very good and exciting to watch, but the stand out is definately Guy Pearce's tough role as the the man with a condition he's still holding onto. If you're a fan of Film Noir I highly reccomend this one, but even if you're not this is one to give a shot.Demands a second viewing, or a third or a fourth or a...",5,A modern masterpiece.,1144800000,"04 12, 2006",2006,1989,"['First', 'own', '3-disc', 'english', 'import', 'so', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'review', 'edition', 'when', 'features', 'can', 'tell', 'what', 'movie', 'about.This', 'film', 'directed', 'british', 'director', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'who', 'also', 'directed', 'brilliant', 'come', 'back', 'batman', 'batman', 'franchise', 'title', 'Batman', 'Begins', 'Memento', 'Nolan', 'second', 'film', 'first', 'film', 'cinema', 'history', 'be', 'told', 'backwards', 'film', 'based', 'brother', 'time', 'unpublished', 'short', 'story', 'was', 'telling', 'trip', 'chicago', 'not', 'exact', 'adaptation', 'story', 'based', 'ideas', 'backdrop', 'short', 'story.Guy', 'Pearce', 'play', 'poor', 'soul', 'Leanard', 'Shelby', 'who', 'condition', 'bassicly', 'short', 'term', 'memory', 'loss', 'So', 'other', 'words', ""n't"", 'have', 'ability', 'create', 'new', 'memories', 'only', 'reason', 'why', 'lenny', 'still', 'living', 'desire', 'revenge', 'murdered', 'whife', 'death', 'only', 'thing', 'can', 'remember', 'last', 'wife', 'dying', 'Due', 'condition', 'make', 'notes', 'clues', 'finding', 'wifes', 'murderer', 'rapist', 'clues', 'wifes', 'killer', 'are', 'tattood', 'body', 'things', 'know', 'are', 'pollaroid', 'photo', 'tell', 'where', 'staying', 'who', 'helping', 'get', 'revenge', 'film', 'bassicly', 'end', 'way', 'beggining', 'end', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'spoil', 'anymore', 'movie', 'up', 'figure', 'clues', 'out.This', 'film', 'should', ""'ve"", 'taken', 'home', 'oscars', 'best', 'screenplay', 'editing', 'very', 'good', 'reasons', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'had', 'start', 'end', 'work', 'way', 'backwards', 'same', 'editing', 'performances', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'exciting', 'watch', 'stand', 'out', 'definately', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'tough', 'role', 'man', 'condition', 'still', 'holding', ""'re"", 'fan', 'Film', 'Noir', 'highly', 'reccomend', 'one', 'even', ""'re"", 'not', 'one', 'give', 'shot.Demands', 'second', 'viewing', 'third', 'fourth']",Memento VHS
541985,A1EX6NR08YH874,B00003CXZ3,Peter Soule,"[4, 4]","I really think that we need more movies like Memento.  Memento scores big because of intellegence, maturity, and most of all being unique.  The problem with many movies is that they don't bring anything new to the screen, and don't have any depth or intellegent plots.  At first, Memento sounds like your average everyday movie, it's about a man who's wife was murdered and now he is seeking revenge.  This seems pretty boring, but it isn't, because there is one thing that makes this movie a whole lot more interesting.  Leonard, the man whos wife was murdered, got an injury on that same night, and because of it, he can not make new memories, he can remember everything that happened up until the injury, but everyting else just ""fades,"" as he says.One more idea that is brought to the movie is that it is shown in reverse, starting at the end of the movie's story and ending at the beginning.  It is a very intellegent idea, because it puts the watcher in Leonards shoes, you know what's going on at the moment, but you have no idea what just happened.  You may think that the movie will be boring because of this, but it left me on the edge of my seat nearly drooling becuase I wanted to find out what would happen next.Memento's acting is amazing.  Guy Pearce puts on a very convincing performance of a nervous and confused Leonard.  Joe Pantoliano also does a great job as Leonards friend, yet you never know for sure who he is until the end of the movie.  Carrie-Ann Moss plays another one of Leonard's friends who puts on a great performance as a hard-to-impress yet understanding woman.Memento is flawless, a masterpeice.  Every element that makes up a good movie is present here, it is a deep and intellegent movie that will keep you on the edge of you seat, thinking and always dying to find out what will happen next.  Without a doubt a 5 star movie, original, unique, exciting, and very intellegent, see this movie.",5,There Needs To Be More Movies Like This,1024790400,"06 23, 2002",2002,1929,"['really', 'think', 'need', 'more', 'movies', 'Memento', 'Memento', 'big', 'intellegence', 'maturity', 'most', 'being', 'unique', 'problem', 'many', 'movies', 'do', ""n't"", 'bring', 'anything', 'new', 'screen', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'depth', 'intellegent', 'plots', 'first', 'Memento', 'average', 'everyday', 'movie', 'man', 'who', 'wife', 'was', 'murdered', 'now', 'seeking', 'revenge', 'pretty', 'boring', ""n't"", 'one', 'thing', 'movie', 'whole', 'lot', 'more', 'interesting', 'Leonard', 'man', 'whos', 'wife', 'was', 'murdered', 'got', 'injury', 'same', 'night', 'can', 'not', 'make', 'new', 'memories', 'can', 'remember', 'everything', 'happened', 'up', 'injury', 'everyting', 'else', 'just', 'fades', 'more', 'idea', 'brought', 'movie', 'shown', 'reverse', 'starting', 'end', 'movie', 'story', 'ending', 'beginning', 'very', 'intellegent', 'idea', 'watcher', 'Leonards', 'shoes', 'know', 'what', 'going', 'moment', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'just', 'happened', 'may', 'think', 'movie', 'will', 'be', 'boring', 'left', 'edge', 'seat', 'nearly', 'drooling', 'becuase', 'wanted', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'would', 'happen', 'next.Memento', 'acting', 'amazing', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'very', 'convincing', 'performance', 'nervous', 'confused', 'Leonard', 'Joe', 'Pantoliano', 'also', 'great', 'job', 'Leonards', 'friend', 'yet', 'never', 'know', 'sure', 'who', 'end', 'movie', 'Carrie-Ann', 'Moss', 'one', 'Leonard', 'friends', 'who', 'puts', 'great', 'performance', 'hard-to-impress', 'yet', 'understanding', 'woman.Memento', 'flawless', 'masterpeice', 'element', 'up', 'good', 'movie', 'present', 'here', 'deep', 'intellegent', 'movie', 'will', 'keep', 'edge', 'seat', 'thinking', 'always', 'dying', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'next', 'doubt', '5', 'star', 'movie', 'original', 'unique', 'exciting', 'very', 'intellegent', 'see', 'movie']",Memento VHS

The first disc is fine, the menu I can understand.  But when you get to the commentary... that's when we start to slide down the surface of things.  See... at the last 15 minutes... the track is backwards.  Like something out of Twin Peaks but not played forward and without subtitles.  Too bad we can't play it in reverse and hear what Mr. Nolan is saying.  For all I know he could be making fun of us for buying this overpriced coaster and listening to his commentary spoken backwards.The second disc is a mess.  I was able to find the movie played in chronilogical order, but in the week I had it (I sold it and bought the normal version) I couldn't even access the trailer.  You have to take these tests and if you answer wrong you go to backwards, and there are soooo many questions that it's hard to keep track of the path you're on.  I was also able to see the foreign posters and a special that was on IFC.  Rumor has it that there are more features but I couldn't find them.  It's a great idea... but it's too dang complicated.  I don't mind the occasional easter egg on a disc but when the whole disc is one?  Forget it.  Call me old fashioned but I am happy with my normal not so fancy version of the movie where I can access the trailer, and TV spot and original short story without going through hoops and laddrers.

My observation of the books selections is that a few of those movie I didn't really have to see but ""Memento"" is one that lived up to the billing.  I admit to being scepticle at first because it seemed that I was watching the movie backwards in sequences.  I wondered what kind of movie it would be since much of it was rerun scenes.  However, I realized that this was a unique movie that keeps the viewers guessing (although I can imagine that some may have taken it back to the video rental without watching the whole movie).  The retelling of the various scenes created impressions as well as doubts and that really came together at the end.  However, the ending was not typical either.  It left us wondering what is the reality.  Along the way there were at least two or three scenes where I had to double-check to see if what I saw was real or not.  ""Memento"" has a plot but it seems less important to the film than the twists and turns it takes us on.  In the end, I was pretty dazed by what I had seen but I knew it had been an exciting ride.  I suggest most people should watch ""Memento"" at least once (excepting small children and pregnant women).

One of his tatoos says, ""Remember Sammy Jenkis.""  Jenkis had the same affliction and Leonard knew him before the accident.I love this movie because it asks a valid question:Upon what do you rely to create your reality?Memories are faulty.Leonard's memory problem is acute, but studies show that everyone's memory is faulty.  Of the people who are let out of jail when physical evidence turns up to clear them, most were convicted on eye witness testimony.  Eye witness testimony has been shown to be among the least reliable evidence.The written word calls for interpretation.Leonard writes things down and even tattoos them on his body.  But, the things he writes down are sometimes helpful, sometimes not, and sometimes call for interpretation and judgment.  After the murder, Leonard finds a note in his pocket that was intended for someone else, which leads him to a bar where strange things happen.How many debates have raged over interpretations of the Bible?Emotions cloud your reality.Leonard gets angry at Tedy and decides to set him up.We knowingly lie to ourselves.Leonard writes down false information to get back at Tedy, knowingly lying to himself because it feels good.  Knowing that he won't recall the lie later.Can't trust what people say.Tedy is a suspicious character, but he gives Leonard some information that is verifiably true.  Does that mean everything he says is true?  How to tell?We are open to suggestion.Leonard's memories change when Tedy challenges him.  Which version is right?  Tedy's, or his own?  Does it mean anything that the power of Tedy's suggestion momentarily causes Leonard to doubt his own version of events that he does remember because they took place before the accident?Emotions cause us to be used.Leonard wants revenge, which sets him up to be used by Tedy.  Revenge is also unsatisfying.  The one thing Leonard should forget, he can't.  Impure motivation clouds his judgement and causes him to be a pawn in someone else's game.Remember Sammy Jenkis.Sammy -- and Leonard's -- ""condition"" is the human condition.The fact is -- we all go through what Leonard is going through, but we can see it more clearly when confronted with a character that is going through an extreme illustration of it.We are all groping through life using unreliable methods to create reality moment by moment.Just an aside, but I loved the fact that the hotel clerk rents Leonard two rooms.

Some reviewers have been (over)using the word &quot;linear&quot; in writing about this film, trying to describe the fact the story is not told beginning with A, and progressing neatly to B, and all the way to Z. However, the film does more than simply skip randomly from one letter to another. The film has a precise structure.Leonard is a man with Hippocampal brain damage. He has short term memory as long as he sticks to one subject. As soon as the subject changes, he has forgotten what he was previously discussing. Someone says something to him, he turns his head, and has forgotten what was said. He also cannot make new memories. He remembers everything that happened in his life before the head injury he sustained when his wife was raped and killed. (or was he hit just before she was attacked?)Leonard is a fighter, however. He tattoos information on his body. He takes Polaroids and writes information on them in indelible black ink. He has a flow chart on the wall of his hotel room with pictures and notes. Step by step, Leonard is learning to cope with his brain deficit. His struggle and success is symbolized (in case we miss it) in his tattoos. The early ones are amateurish scrawls, while the later ones are precise lettering, and the very recent artistic script.The narrative structure for this story is Leonard's ability to frame his experiences. At first it is poor, and the viewer is confused. We see scenes, and are introduced to characters, but we can't make any connections among them. Later in the movie, each scene makes sense; it connects to something else; we see the whole picture, and not scattered and disjointed bits.It is very clever. I thought of Roshomon, watching it, but it is much more intricate than Roshomon. Even more mind-boggling is Guy Pearce as Leonard. He proves himself a consummate actor in this film, at least to me. His range is astounding: the last film I saw him in was Priscilla, Queen of the Desert.Also, if you see this film, you get to hear one of the funniest lines of the year: &quot;What's going on here? OK...I'm chasing him. No. He's chasing me.&quot;",5,"Abandom All Expectations, You Who Enter Here",1005523200,"11 12, 2001",2001,2150,"['Bring', 'expectations', 'film', 'reviewers', 'have', 'been', 'using', 'word', 'quot', 'quot', 'writing', 'film', 'trying', 'describe', 'fact', 'story', 'not', 'told', 'beginning', 'A', 'progressing', 'neatly', 'B', 'way', 'Z', 'However', 'film', 'more', 'simply', 'skip', 'randomly', 'one', 'letter', 'film', 'precise', 'structure.Leonard', 'man', 'Hippocampal', 'brain', 'damage', 'short', 'term', 'memory', 'as', 'long', 'one', 'subject', 'As', 'soon', 'subject', 'changes', 'forgotten', 'what', 'was', 'previously', 'discussing', 'Someone', 'something', 'head', 'forgotten', 'what', 'was', 'said', 'also', 'can', 'not', 'make', 'new', 'memories', 'everything', 'happened', 'life', 'head', 'injury', 'sustained', 'when', 'wife', 'was', 'raped', 'killed', 'was', 'hit', 'just', 'was', 'attacked', 'Leonard', 'fighter', 'however', 'information', 'body', 'Polaroids', 'information', 'indelible', 'black', 'ink', 'flow', 'chart', 'wall', 'hotel', 'room', 'pictures', 'notes', 'Step', 'step', 'Leonard', 'learning', 'cope', 'brain', 'deficit', 'struggle', 'success', 'symbolized', 'case', 'miss', 'tattoos', 'early', 'ones', 'are', 'amateurish', 'scrawls', 'later', 'ones', 'are', 'precise', 'lettering', 'very', 'recent', 'artistic', 'script.The', 'narrative', 'structure', 'story', 'Leonard', 'ability', 'frame', 'experiences', 'first', 'poor', 'viewer', 'confused', 'see', 'scenes', 'are', 'introduced', 'characters', 'ca', ""n't"", 'make', 'connections', 'Later', 'movie', 'scene', 'sense', 'something', 'else', 'see', 'whole', 'picture', 'not', 'scattered', 'disjointed', 'bits.It', 'very', 'clever', 'thought', 'Roshomon', 'watching', 'much', 'more', 'intricate', 'Roshomon', 'Even', 'more', 'mind-boggling', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'Leonard', 'consummate', 'actor', 'film', 'least', 'range', 'astounding', 'last', 'film', 'saw', 'was', 'Priscilla', 'Queen', 'Desert.Also', 'see', 'film', 'get', 'hear', 'one', 'funniest', 'lines', 'year', 'quot', 'What', 'going', 'here', 'OK', ""'m"", 'chasing', 'chasing', 'me.', 'quot']",Memento VHS

What makes Memento a great and unique film is that it plays backwards, though some parts acctually play forward(i.e the black and white scense)it kind of gets you confused which you'll have to acctually use your brain to figure out though later in the film it becomes easier to understand and you'll get the hang of it.The story is pretty simple.  Leonard(Pearce)is out for revenge, to get the man who raped and murdered his wife.  The problem is that Leonard suffers from a rare brain disorder which means he can't make new memory(AKA short term memory loss)but for some odd reason he can remember things before his injury(which still kind of bothers me for some reason) and must write down notes and stuff like that inorder to get to the next puzzle or answer.  Since he has this short term memory loss he must take pictures, write down things and get tatoo's on his body which gives him clues and facts in order for him to get one step closer to the answer.  On his way through this journey of finding the man who did this to him he makes friends with a woman named Natalie and Teddy who may know more about Leonard then he could imagine.  To make things worse for Leonard he gets caught with some troubles like getting cooked up with some guy named Dodd(what he does and who he is you'll have to see the film for yourself)...Overall this is an Excellent film.The film is pretty original if you ask me and Director Christopher Nolan did an excellent job editing, pacing this whole film.I really like how the movie plays backwards which give the audience little confusion but that's it and the black and white scenes are very juicy and detailed until the very last scene where we find out what the real truth is.  You see the movie plays at the very end of the film and plays backwards to the very beginning of the film.  I really liked the characters in this film especially Teddy.  The characters were great and it's good to see Carrie-Anne Moss not dressed in black trying to save Zion and make out with Neo for a change...Overall Memento blew me away.

542013,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00003CXZ3,Roland E. Zwick,"[13, 14]","Christopher Nolan's mind-bending thriller ""Memento"" is one of those rare instances in which the form of a movie is designed to match its content.  Here is a film all about the nature of short-term memory, which, by its own ingenious structure, challenges the audience to cope with its own mastery of short-term memory.Guy Pearce stars as Leonard Shelby, a man who suffers from a ""condition"" brought on by a trauma to the head that prevents him from being able to retain any short-term memories (he can remember his life only up to the moment of his wife's rape and murder).  To cope with his affliction, Leonard writes himself copious notes, mostly on the backs of polaroids he takes on a regular basis but sometimes on his own body in the form of informational tattoos.  To approximate the sense of dislocation of time and place that Leonard feels on a daily basis - as he has to reorient himself to people and events he has recently met and since forgotten - Nolan has chosen to structure his film in a backward progression, so that the first scene ends up being the most recent and the final scene the earliest in time.  This technique is not exactly an original one, since the 1983 movie ""Betrayal"" used roughly the same format in the context of a romantic drama.  Still, ""Memento"" deserves enormous credit not only for trusting its audience to be able to cope with this complex style but for managing to keep most of the plot details well-focused and coherent for most of the film's duration.One of the risks of a film like ""Memento"" is that it could, if handled badly, easily become a mere exercise in technical ""gimmickry.""  One of the ways that Nolan avoids that trap is by devising a plot that is as gripping as any to be found in a traditionally structured example of film noir.  ""Memento"" is filled with the kinds of narrative twists and turns, surprise revelations and moral ambiguities that form the basis for any good example of the genre.  More important, Nolan makes Leonard a compellingly sympathetic character, one whom we come to care for because his plight is so heartrending at its core.  Here is a man who not only has to deal with the immense incomprehensibilities of his life but who cannot even benefit from the time factor that helps mourning people come to terms with the loss of a loved one.  To Leonard, his wife's death is a perpetual recent event, one from which he can never attain that emotional distance so key to finally overcoming his grief.Special note should be taken of Guy Pearce, who delivers a knockout performance as Leonard, perfectly capturing the determination, frustration and emotional pain that define the character.  Carrie-Ann Moss and Joe Pantoliano offer superb support as two perpetual ""strangers"" who play significant roles in Leonard's strangely dislocated and fragmented life - yet just what those roles are is as much a mystery to us as it is to Leonard.  David Julyan's subtle and haunting musical score and Wally Pfister's fine cinematography greatly contribute to the unique quality of the film.Watching ""Memento"" is like entering a strange, mystical dream.  Like Leonard, we feel as if we have suddenly been stripped of that ability to fully make sense out of the chaotic world around us.  We feel cut loose from our mental moorings and find ourselves adrift in a world bereft of the rules of chronological reasoning we cling to so desperately for survival.  How many movies actually manage to shift our paradigm of perception and make us look anew at the way we observe the world around us?  Not many, I can assure you.Christopher Nolan's brilliant and audacious cinematic tour de force reawakens our faith in the medium and those who dare to challenge it.",5,a brilliant tour de force,1009756800,"12 31, 2001",2001,3719,"['Christopher', 'Nolan', 'mind-bending', 'thriller', 'Memento', 'one', 'rare', 'instances', 'form', 'movie', 'designed', 'match', 'content', 'Here', 'film', 'nature', 'short-term', 'memory', 'own', 'ingenious', 'structure', 'audience', 'cope', 'own', 'mastery', 'short-term', 'memory.Guy', 'Pearce', 'Leonard', 'Shelby', 'man', 'who', 'condition', 'brought', 'trauma', 'head', 'being', 'able', 'retain', 'short-term', 'memories', 'can', 'remember', 'life', 'only', 'up', 'moment', 'wife', 'rape', 'murder', 'cope', 'affliction', 'Leonard', 'copious', 'notes', 'mostly', 'backs', 'polaroids', 'regular', 'basis', 'sometimes', 'own', 'body', 'form', 'informational', 'tattoos', 'approximate', 'sense', 'dislocation', 'time', 'place', 'Leonard', 'daily', 'basis', 'reorient', 'people', 'events', 'recently', 'met', 'forgotten', 'Nolan', 'chosen', 'structure', 'film', 'backward', 'progression', 'first', 'scene', 'up', 'being', 'most', 'recent', 'final', 'scene', 'earliest', 'time', 'technique', 'not', 'exactly', 'original', 'one', '1983', 'movie', 'Betrayal', 'used', 'roughly', 'same', 'format', 'context', 'romantic', 'drama', 'Still', 'Memento', 'enormous', 'credit', 'not', 'only', 'trusting', 'audience', 'be', 'able', 'cope', 'complex', 'style', 'managing', 'keep', 'most', 'plot', 'details', 'well-focused', 'coherent', 'most', 'film', 'duration.One', 'risks', 'film', 'Memento', 'could', 'handled', 'badly', 'easily', 'become', 'mere', 'exercise', 'technical', 'gimmickry', 'One', 'ways', 'Nolan', 'trap', 'devising', 'plot', 'as', 'gripping', 'be', 'found', 'traditionally', 'structured', 'example', 'film', 'noir', 'Memento', 'filled', 'kinds', 'narrative', 'twists', 'turns', 'surprise', 'revelations', 'moral', 'ambiguities', 'form', 'basis', 'good', 'example', 'genre', 'More', 'important', 'Nolan', 'Leonard', 'compellingly', 'sympathetic', 'character', 'one', 'whom', 'come', 'care', 'plight', 'so', 'heartrending', 'core', 'Here', 'man', 'who', 'not', 'only', 'deal', 'immense', 'incomprehensibilities', 'life', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'even', 'benefit', 'time', 'factor', 'mourning', 'people', 'come', 'terms', 'loss', 'loved', 'one', 'Leonard', 'wife', 'death', 'perpetual', 'recent', 'event', 'one', 'can', 'never', 'attain', 'emotional', 'distance', 'so', 'key', 'finally', 'overcoming', 'grief.Special', 'note', 'should', 'be', 'taken', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'who', 'knockout', 'performance', 'Leonard', 'perfectly', 'capturing', 'determination', 'frustration', 'emotional', 'pain', 'character', 'Carrie-Ann', 'Moss', 'Joe', 'Pantoliano', 'offer', 'superb', 'support', 'two', 'perpetual', 'strangers', 'who', 'play', 'significant', 'roles', 'Leonard', 'strangely', 'dislocated', 'fragmented', 'life', 'yet', 'just', 'what', 'roles', 'are', 'as', 'much', 'mystery', 'Leonard', 'David', 'Julyan', 'subtle', 'haunting', 'musical', 'score', 'Wally', 'Pfister', 'fine', 'cinematography', 'greatly', 'unique', 'quality', 'film.Watching', 'Memento', 'entering', 'strange', 'mystical', 'dream', 'Leonard', 'feel', 'have', 'suddenly', 'been', 'stripped', 'ability', 'fully', 'make', 'sense', 'chaotic', 'world', 'feel', 'cut', 'loose', 'mental', 'moorings', 'find', 'adrift', 'world', 'bereft', 'rules', 'chronological', 'reasoning', 'cling', 'so', 'desperately', 'survival', 'How', 'many', 'movies', 'actually', 'manage', 'shift', 'paradigm', 'perception', 'make', 'look', 'anew', 'way', 'observe', 'world', 'Not', 'many', 'can', 'assure', 'Nolan', 'brilliant', 'audacious', 'cinematic', 'tour', 'force', 'faith', 'medium', 'who', 'dare', 'challenge']",Memento VHS

542025,A107O8UATN67M8,B00003CXZ3,Samurai,"[1, 2]","A great director is born! The sign of a true artist is to take a simple story or scene and recreate it masterfully. That, in short, is what Christopher Nolan has done with what would have otherwise been a by-the-numbers film noir tale.  Memento sticks with you like a bad head cold. You just can't get it out of your system long after you've seen it.  The endless plot twists, the ingenious editing ploys, the ambiguity and mystery of each character, the backwards tatoos, and oh that cool Jaguar! All superb! Memento is the thinking man's mystery movie.Guy Pierce gave the performance of the year. This was arguably the most difficult role in years. Here's why: Guy had to play a character that a) did or did not rape and kill his own wife, b) if he did kill his wife, he had to hide it behind the deer-in-the-headlights performance, but that would be difficult since he has forgotten the details of the murder thus he would have to invent conceit from fleeting bits of memory, c) if he is innocent, as an actor, Guy can't give away that he is innocent otherwise he gives away the movie. So how do you play a guy that might or might not be innocent of a crime that he doesn't remember committing or maybe he does but has conveniently forgotten. See what I mean? Guy Pierce deserved the Oscar if for no other reason than he delivered an impeccable American accent (the guy's Australian).This is about as close as modern filmmaking will get to duplicating the effects of Hitchcock's masterpieces. Hitchcock literally took us inside his character's mind by going to great pains to show the story unfold from the character's perspective (Vertigo, Spellbound, Rear Window, etc.) Christopher Nolan accomplishes similar results with the visual trick of looping back every 10 minutes and repeating the action because the character's short term memory only lasts about 10 minutes then he has to re-create his life again. This goes on throughout the entire film (and possibly ad infinitum). We never actually solve the mystery which is the most frustrating and yet most deliberate part of this film. You, the audience are actually supposed to figure the mystery out. You are, believe it or not, required to think through this film. I know, I know, we're supposed to think? At a movie?The character played by Carrie-Anne Moss is actually similar to the character of Constance played by the gorgeous Ingrid Bergman in Hitchcock's 'Spellbound'. She too had to help an amnesiac, played by Gregory Peck, regain his memory.Memento has some sidesteps that confused and frustrated me. For instance, the ending was a bit abrupt and could have been more skillfully explained. Saying that Leonard ""raped"" and murdered his wife was probably over-the-top and made me wonder why would a husband rape his own wife first and then murder her? It cast doubts in my mind that Leonard committed the crime because most crimes of passion don't involve raping your wife first. The black and white flashbacks of the old man were a distraction and a side story that I have yet to piece together. Some eagle-eye observers on the internet spotted Teddy in the background of those flashback scenes. Did Teddy kill Leonard's wife? Did Leonard kill his own wife and then kill Teddy to shut Teddy up? Will Carrie-Anne Moss go out with me?",4,Mind Bending Masterpiece,1029369600,"08 15, 2002",2002,3298,"['great', 'director', 'born', 'sign', 'true', 'artist', 'take', 'simple', 'story', 'scene', 'recreate', 'masterfully', 'short', 'what', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'done', 'what', 'would', 'have', 'otherwise', 'been', 'by-the-numbers', 'film', 'noir', 'tale', 'Memento', 'sticks', 'like', 'bad', 'head', 'cold', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'system', 'long', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'endless', 'plot', 'twists', 'ingenious', 'editing', 'ploys', 'ambiguity', 'mystery', 'character', 'backwards', 'tatoos', 'cool', 'Jaguar', 'superb', 'Memento', 'thinking', 'man', 'mystery', 'movie.Guy', 'Pierce', 'gave', 'performance', 'year', 'was', 'arguably', 'most', 'difficult', 'role', 'years', 'Here', 'why', 'Guy', 'had', 'play', 'character', 'did', 'did', 'not', 'rape', 'kill', 'own', 'wife', 'b', 'did', 'kill', 'wife', 'had', 'hide', 'deer-in-the-headlights', 'performance', 'would', 'be', 'difficult', 'forgotten', 'details', 'murder', 'thus', 'would', 'have', 'invent', 'conceit', 'fleeting', 'bits', 'memory', 'c', 'innocent', 'actor', 'Guy', 'ca', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'innocent', 'otherwise', 'away', 'movie', 'So', 'how', 'do', 'play', 'guy', 'might', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'innocent', 'crime', ""n't"", 'remember', 'committing', 'maybe', 'conveniently', 'forgotten', 'See', 'what', 'mean', 'Guy', 'Pierce', 'deserved', 'Oscar', 'other', 'reason', 'delivered', 'impeccable', 'American', 'accent', 'guy', 'Australian', '.This', 'about', 'as', 'close', 'modern', 'filmmaking', 'will', 'get', 'duplicating', 'effects', 'Hitchcock', 'masterpieces', 'Hitchcock', 'literally', 'took', 'character', 'mind', 'going', 'great', 'pains', 'show', 'story', 'unfold', 'character', 'perspective', 'Vertigo', 'Spellbound', 'Rear', 'Window', 'etc', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'similar', 'results', 'visual', 'trick', 'looping', 'back', '10', 'minutes', 'repeating', 'action', 'character', 'short', 'term', 'memory', 'only', '10', 'minutes', 'then', 're-create', 'life', 'again', 'entire', 'film', 'possibly', 'ad', 'infinitum', 'never', 'actually', 'solve', 'mystery', 'most', 'frustrating', 'yet', 'most', 'deliberate', 'part', 'film', 'audience', 'are', 'actually', 'supposed', 'figure', 'mystery', 'out', 'are', 'believe', 'not', 'required', 'think', 'film', 'know', 'know', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'think', 'movie', 'character', 'played', 'Carrie-Anne', 'Moss', 'actually', 'similar', 'character', 'Constance', 'played', 'gorgeous', 'Ingrid', 'Bergman', 'Hitchcock', ""'Spellbound"", 'too', 'had', 'help', 'amnesiac', 'played', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'regain', 'memory.Memento', 'sidesteps', 'confused', 'frustrated', 'instance', 'ending', 'was', 'bit', 'abrupt', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'skillfully', 'explained', 'Saying', 'Leonard', 'raped', 'murdered', 'wife', 'was', 'probably', 'over-the-top', 'made', 'wonder', 'why', 'would', 'husband', 'rape', 'own', 'wife', 'first', 'then', 'murder', 'cast', 'doubts', 'mind', 'Leonard', 'committed', 'crime', 'most', 'crimes', 'passion', 'do', ""n't"", 'involve', 'raping', 'wife', 'first', 'black', 'white', 'flashbacks', 'old', 'man', 'were', 'distraction', 'side', 'story', 'have', 'yet', 'piece', 'together', 'eagle-eye', 'observers', 'internet', 'spotted', 'Teddy', 'background', 'flashback', 'scenes', 'Did', 'Teddy', 'kill', 'Leonard', 'wife', 'Did', 'Leonard', 'kill', 'own', 'wife', 'then', 'kill', 'Teddy', 'shut', 'Teddy', 'up', 'Will', 'Carrie-Anne', 'Moss', 'go', 'out']",Memento VHS

The film opens on a brutal image. A photograph of a grisly murder that slowly begins to fade. The photograph slides back into the camera. The flash goes off. The blood slowly begins to disappear from the walls. And the murdered victim rises to his feet. The stage is set for a tense, dramatic and emotional thriller that tells the story of Leonard Shelby (played by an excellent and pretty fine if I do say so Guy Pearce) in reverse. Leonard is searching. He is looking for somebody in particular, the man who raped and murdered his wife. But the only problem is that Leonard suffers from short term memory loss, causing him to forget things that happened minutes before. To remember things, he keeps notes and tattoos important information on his body. With ten minute footage intermixed with a black and white shot subplot, the film takes you on a ride full of twists and turns. You know what the effect is, you know what the present is, but what was the cause? As the film begins to unfold, the story begins to reshape. We meet Teddy (Joe Pantalino? is that right?), a cop who may or may not be on Leonard's side. We also meet a waitress named Natalie (Carrie-Anne Moss) who may have alterior motives for helping Leonard. The ending left me astounded and wondering what exactly happened the night his wife was killed and what kind of guy is Leonard. I won't give away the ending, but trust me, it wraps it up (excuse me)starts it up nicely. 'Memento' is truly a great picture, why don't more movies like this get seen or even made?

542029,A1C58YXM2A30CY,B00003CXZ3,"Scotman's Film & Book Reviews ""Film & Book Re...","[1, 1]","Chris Nolan movies are starting to grow on me.  The director of Following, Batman, etc., tells a story of a guy who has no short-term memory, who keeps notes all over the place, even tattooing the more important ones, to remember what happened an hour or even ten minutes before.  It's also about a drug-dealing gal who wants to get back at her boyfriend and a few other guys and uses our hero's lack of memory to use him for her own vengeance.It's a story about vengeance and the blocks in the road to achieving it, that even with your handicap you can stay the course.  But what if the course is twisted and you can barely remember the whys and hows of it all?It's about a guy who feels guilty for what he did to a guy who had the same condition and also had a wife who died.Nolan's film is the most unusual cinematic adventure I've ever seen.  It's not your basic action thriller, though there's plenty of both.  It plays backwards.  You get the ending right from the start and then find how he got there.I heard that there is a ""linear"" version that goes from the ""end"" and moves to the ""beginning"", but that would be really dumb.

His wife has died and Lenny has lost the ability to create new memories. He lives in a fog where the things that have just happened quickly fade into oblivion. The last thing that he can remember is his wife; his wife dying. What keeps Lenny going is the search for his wife's killer. Because of his condition, he can't remember for more than a few minutes, so he uses notes, picture, tattoos, and conditioning to keep himself on track. After searching for who knows how long, Lenny has closed in on the man he has been looking for. But is it the right guy?My Opinion: Memento was gripping from the very first moment and it hasn't let up even though I've finished watching it over 12 hours ago. I loved the concept of Lenny not being able to make any new memories. It fits excellently with the backward method the story is told with. It took some mental work to put the pieces together one by one as they happened, but I thoroughly enjoyed doing it. The plot was very tight since it had to be able to fit together in small slices backwards. This forced them to have a story that worked; something that other movies are sadly lacking. The subplot of Sammy Jankis rounds out a very full story and makes Memento something very special. I found the acting to be top notch Guy Pearce is awesome as Lenny. I didn't doubt his condition for an instant. Joe Pantoliano is equally as great playing Teddy. Leonard decides not to believe Teddy's lies. We are left on our own to decide. No mater what conclusion I come to about Teddy, one thing is certain: Memento is a highly entertaining movie. It is a prime example of why I love movies like I do. Don't miss it.DVD Quality: Video: Widescreen Anamorphic 2.35:1 with great video quality.  Sound: DD5.1  Extras: Tons of extras including the entire 50 page short story &quot;Memento&quot;, Cast Biographies, Newspaper clippings pictures notes and clues from the story, Interview with the director, and Trailers. Menus: The menus are freaky and very cool. Things appear and disappear from different options as you move around. You get flashes of things that make you feel like Lenny.What You Should Do:  See this movie. See it on DVD and check out all the extra features.

A certain scene will play until it reaches the starting point of the scene before it. Christopher Nolan used this technique to put the viewer into the same perspective as the protagonist. He suffers from a short term memory disorder that renders him incapable of making new memories past the point of his accident. During a robbery of his house, he sustained a serious head injury that messed up his memory. So he is trying to track down his wife's killer. However, it's very difficult for him to do because he can't remember new things that he's just discovered. To compensate for this, he has a series of tattoos with the certain facts that he has confirmed. He also takes pictures and makes notes to remember people or places that he's been to. The film is executed brilliantly and showcases the perfect actors. Guy Pearce stars as the protagonist, Leonard Shelby. And the film co-stars Carrie-Anne Moss (The Matrix, Red Planet) as Natalie, and Joe Pantoliano (Bad Boys II, The Fugitive) as Teddy. The film also has a terrific twist of an ending. 5 stars, one of my favorite films.Sidenote: This DVD edition, the Limited Edition, has a very unique style to it.

542042,A1TWBU1CK70ZZJ,B00003CXZ3,Springtownspears,"[0, 1]","What has not been commented on too much is the subtle humour present in this film noir.  There is something subtly funny about the lengths Leonard will go to seek revenge for his wife's death,as he attempts to rationally cope with his disability, including Polaroid photos, notes to himself, maps, and body tattoos; not to mention stealing a dead man's Jaguar.  Of course to him it is not at all funny, but a thoroughly rational and disciplined response to a debilitating psychological condition. By this constant discipline he hopes to overcome his disability.  I thought this film was strong in almost all ways, including its portrayal of L.A. lowlife,a brutal drug-related murder, the character Teddy, and the use of Sammy Jankis as another example of a person with short-term memory loss. Sammy was a sad case, being denied insurance benefits after an accident; the insurance company--more specifically Leonard-- determined his condition was psychological, not physical.Leonard constantly forces himself to remember Sammy. I thought the scenes with Natalie, who helps him try to find his wife's murderer after Leonard beats up Dodd, were excellent. Whether Leonard or Dodd actually beats up Natalie is unclear. Leonard's memory  is so faulty it's hard to tell. All Leonard knows is he loved his wife, and he has mementos of their life to prove it.  He even has a call girl come in to recreate their former life.  After two viewings I still find it somewhat surrealistic as to what actually happened, even including whether his wife is truly dead or not, or whether in fact Teddy is honest. I think the bulk of the evidence suggests that he is.  There is a short scene late in the film showing his wife embracing his tattooed body, indicating she was alive after he believes she died. The film is very good at evoking for the audience a state of mind of short-term memory loss. There is also some question about the underlying assumptions of the film including the assumption that Sammy's wife was diabetic: Teddy says late in the film that Sammy didn't have a wife; it was Leonard's wife who was diabetic.",5,Subtly  humorous among other things,1091577600,"08 4, 2004",2004,2109,"['What', 'not', 'been', 'commented', 'too', 'much', 'subtle', 'humour', 'present', 'film', 'noir', 'something', 'subtly', 'funny', 'lengths', 'Leonard', 'will', 'go', 'seek', 'revenge', 'wife', 'death', 'rationally', 'cope', 'disability', 'including', 'Polaroid', 'photos', 'maps', 'body', 'tattoos', 'not', 'mention', 'stealing', 'dead', 'man', 'Jaguar', 'course', 'not', 'funny', 'thoroughly', 'rational', 'disciplined', 'response', 'debilitating', 'psychological', 'condition', 'constant', 'discipline', 'overcome', 'disability', 'thought', 'film', 'was', 'strong', 'almost', 'ways', 'including', 'portrayal', 'L.A.', 'lowlife', 'brutal', 'drug-related', 'murder', 'character', 'Teddy', 'use', 'Sammy', 'Jankis', 'example', 'person', 'short-term', 'memory', 'loss', 'Sammy', 'was', 'sad', 'case', 'being', 'denied', 'insurance', 'benefits', 'accident', 'insurance', 'company', 'more', 'specifically', 'Leonard', 'determined', 'condition', 'was', 'psychological', 'not', 'physical.Leonard', 'constantly', 'remember', 'Sammy', 'thought', 'scenes', 'Natalie', 'who', 'try', 'find', 'wife', 'murderer', 'Leonard', 'up', 'Dodd', 'were', 'excellent', 'Whether', 'Leonard', 'Dodd', 'actually', 'up', 'Natalie', 'unclear', 'Leonard', 'memory', 'so', 'faulty', 'hard', 'tell', 'Leonard', 'loved', 'wife', 'mementos', 'life', 'prove', 'even', 'call', 'girl', 'come', 'recreate', 'former', 'life', 'two', 'viewings', 'still', 'find', 'somewhat', 'surrealistic', 'what', 'actually', 'happened', 'even', 'including', 'wife', 'truly', 'dead', 'not', 'fact', 'Teddy', 'honest', 'think', 'bulk', 'evidence', 'short', 'scene', 'late', 'film', 'showing', 'wife', 'embracing', 'tattooed', 'body', 'indicating', 'was', 'alive', 'died', 'film', 'very', 'good', 'evoking', 'audience', 'state', 'mind', 'short-term', 'memory', 'loss', 'also', 'question', 'underlying', 'assumptions', 'film', 'including', 'assumption', 'Sammy', 'wife', 'was', 'diabetic', 'Teddy', 'late', 'film', 'Sammy', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'wife', 'was', 'Leonard', 'wife', 'who', 'was', 'diabetic']",Memento VHS

It was such an original way of telling a story that I was excited to show it to my friends at the earliest opportunity.They hated it.The opening scene shows Leonard Shelby (Pearce) killing Teddy (Pantoliano), but that scene is actually how the story ends. Leonard suffered a head injury when his wife was murdered by intruders and hasn't been able to form short-term memories since the event. He remembers everything up to that point, such as who he is and what he did for a living, but can't build new memories.What would it be like to wake up every day and wonder where you were? What are you supposed to be doing that day?In order to place the viewer in a similar position, Nolan tells the story in reverse. We see events unfold and new information is introduced each time. The information changes our perceptions of the events we have already seen and the people we have already met. Who can Leonard trust? How can he keep the information readily available if he's going to forget everything?Nolan actually tells two stories. One is in black and white and proceeds in normal chronological order. This tells the story of Leonard's life before the accident. He worked as an insurance investigator and one of the claimants, Sammy Jankis, had the same problem with his memory. A tattoo on Leonard's wrist tells him to remember Sammy Jankis, and he's able to because it happened before he suffered the head injury.A second story shows Leonard's hunt for his wife's murderer. This time, Nolan tells it in color and uses reverse chronological order.Are you with me so far? Good.You can see why my friends hated the film. It requires patience and your full attention to understand what is going on. Furthermore, Leonard is an unreliable narrator, so we can't trust everything. Nolan presumably did this to show that Leonard can't trust his own thoughts.In order to function at all, Leonard employs a series of devices to aid his memory. He also sticks to a routine as much as possible. He takes photos of his car, his motel, and people he meets. As he finds out information about people, he writes notes on the photos.Teddy is either a crooked cop, a complete liar, or both. He claims to be helping Leonard look for his wife's killer, but he makes several attempts to borrow Leonard's car. When you see the closing scenes, you'll understand what his true motive may be.Natalie (Moss) is also claiming to help Leonard by providing information. Unfortunately, she also has motives of her own.Leonard doesn't know who to trust. He also doesn't know how long he's been trying to avenge his wife's death. Because of the nature of the narrative, we aren't even sure that Leonard hasn't already killed the murderer at some point in the past. Are Teddy or Natalie using him for some other purpose? Are they even who they say they are?I've seen Memento at least twice a year since I first saw it. It has endless replay value and it's interesting to see some of the events unfold when you know the outcome. Nolan gets the little details right as well as the big ones. Notice how Leonard forgets which way the motel door opens and how he brushes his hand against a glass in a restaurant because he's forgotten that he put it there.Each time I watch a Nolan movie I think it's the best thing he has ever done. Whether it's The Dark Knight, Inception, The Prestige, or Memento, he treats his audience with respect. Rather than spell out every little aspect of the story, he allows the audience to draw its own conclusion. That alienates some viewers, as it did with my friends, but the payoff is worth it if you are willing to pay full attention.",5,Nolan's best film?,1330473600,"02 29, 2012",2012,3889,"['Memento', '2000', 'Drama', 'Mystery', 'Thriller', '113', 'minutesDirected', 'Christopher', 'NolanStarring', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'Joe', 'Pantoliano', 'Carrie-Anne', 'Moss', 'What', 'last', 'thing', 'remember', 'wife', 'dying', 'remember', 'watching', 'Memento', 'cable', 'buying', 'few', 'days', 'later', 'was', 'such', 'original', 'way', 'telling', 'story', 'was', 'excited', 'show', 'friends', 'earliest', 'opportunity.They', 'hated', 'it.The', 'opening', 'scene', 'Leonard', 'Shelby', 'Pearce', 'killing', 'Teddy', 'Pantoliano', 'scene', 'actually', 'how', 'story', 'Leonard', 'suffered', 'head', 'injury', 'when', 'wife', 'was', 'murdered', 'intruders', ""n't"", 'been', 'able', 'form', 'short-term', 'memories', 'event', 'everything', 'up', 'point', 'such', 'who', 'what', 'did', 'living', 'ca', ""n't"", 'build', 'new', 'would', 'be', 'wake', 'up', 'day', 'wonder', 'where', 'were', 'What', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'doing', 'day', 'order', 'place', 'viewer', 'similar', 'position', 'Nolan', 'story', 'reverse', 'see', 'events', 'unfold', 'new', 'information', 'introduced', 'time', 'information', 'perceptions', 'events', 'have', 'already', 'seen', 'people', 'have', 'already', 'met', 'Who', 'can', 'Leonard', 'trust', 'How', 'can', 'keep', 'information', 'readily', 'available', 'going', 'forget', 'everything', 'Nolan', 'actually', 'two', 'stories', 'One', 'black', 'white', 'proceeds', 'normal', 'chronological', 'order', 'story', 'Leonard', 'life', 'accident', 'worked', 'insurance', 'investigator', 'one', 'claimants', 'Sammy', 'Jankis', 'had', 'same', 'problem', 'memory', 'tattoo', 'Leonard', 'wrist', 'remember', 'Sammy', 'Jankis', 'able', 'because', 'happened', 'suffered', 'head', 'injury.A', 'second', 'story', 'Leonard', 'hunt', 'wife', 'murderer', 'time', 'Nolan', 'color', 'reverse', 'chronological', 'order.Are', 'so', 'far', 'Good.You', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'friends', 'hated', 'film', 'patience', 'full', 'attention', 'understand', 'what', 'going', 'Furthermore', 'Leonard', 'unreliable', 'narrator', 'ca', ""n't"", 'trust', 'everything', 'Nolan', 'presumably', 'did', 'show', 'Leonard', 'ca', ""n't"", 'trust', 'own', 'thoughts.In', 'order', 'function', 'Leonard', 'series', 'devices', 'aid', 'memory', 'also', 'routine', 'as', 'much', 'possible', 'photos', 'car', 'motel', 'people', 'out', 'information', 'people', 'notes', 'photos.Teddy', 'crooked', 'cop', 'complete', 'liar', 'be', 'helping', 'Leonard', 'look', 'wife', 'killer', 'several', 'attempts', 'borrow', 'Leonard', 'car', 'When', 'see', 'closing', 'scenes', ""'ll"", 'understand', 'what', 'true', 'motive', 'may', 'be.Natalie', 'Moss', 'also', 'claiming', 'help', 'Leonard', 'providing', 'information', 'Unfortunately', 'also', 'motives', 'own.Leonard', ""n't"", 'know', 'who', 'trust', 'also', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'long', 'been', 'trying', 'avenge', 'wife', 'death', 'nature', 'narrative', 'are', ""n't"", 'even', 'sure', 'Leonard', ""n't"", 'already', 'killed', 'murderer', 'point', 'past', 'Are', 'Teddy', 'Natalie', 'using', 'other', 'purpose', 'Are', 'even', 'who', 'say', 'are', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Memento', 'least', 'twice', 'year', 'first', 'saw', 'endless', 'replay', 'value', 'interesting', 'see', 'events', 'unfold', 'when', 'know', 'outcome', 'Nolan', 'little', 'details', 'right', 'as', 'well', 'big', 'ones', 'Notice', 'how', 'Leonard', 'way', 'motel', 'door', 'opens', 'how', 'hand', 'glass', 'restaurant', 'forgotten', 'put', 'there.Each', 'time', 'watch', 'Nolan', 'movie', 'think', 'best', 'thing', 'ever', 'done', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'Inception', 'Prestige', 'Memento', 'audience', 'respect', 'Rather', 'spell', 'out', 'little', 'aspect', 'story', 'audience', 'draw', 'own', 'conclusion', 'viewers', 'did', 'friends', 'payoff', 'are', 'willing', 'pay', 'full', 'attention']",Memento VHS

It didn't do well in the theatres because nobody knew how to market it (the trailer is truly awful), but it has done excellently on video due to wonderful word of mouth.Definitely pay a few bucks extra for the special edition. The main disc is weak on the extras, and doesn't have a DTS soundtrack (DTS is much better than Dolby 5.1 if you have a DTS-decoding receiver).What is really engaging about this movie are the twist and turns along the way that lead to a very satisfying payoff. The mind-bending going backwards in time bit is an interesting idea, but could easily have been a ponderous disaster in less sure hands than Christopher Nolan's. Each of the 10-minute flashback seens begin and end in exactly the right places. Each new revelation and twist leads logically to the next.The movie's weakest point is that, in the end, you don't like any of the characters. They are all selfish bastards, in a sense. Hey, but that's film noir for you. If you didn't like The Usual Suspects or Reservoir Dogs, you probably won't like this one.

Christopher Nolan does a perfect job of capturing the emotion and despair of Leonard Shelby. See, the plot goes something like ths:Shelby is happily married when someone breaks into his house and kills/rapes his wife, while in the process smashing his head against a mirror, damaging his brain and causing him to lose all short-term memory. Shelby then goes on a manhunt to avenge his wife's death. This is made much more difficult by the lack of police cooperation and his condition, which forces him to write himself endless notes, and, for the really important stuff, get tatoos made so he'll never forget.This premise alone would be entertaining enough, but Nolan decided to do something a little different: He tells the story all backwards and out-of-order. At first this is quite confusing, as the viewer is forced to see things the way Leonard does - in 10-minute sections that reveal the developing plot, intercut with shorter sections that show scenes from Leonard's past. This is crucial to the meaning of the film.So Leonard finds some assistance in Teddy (Joe Pantaliano - &quot;The Matrix) and Natalie (Carrie Anne-Moss &quot;The Matrix&quot;). The problem is, Leonard can never be sure if these &quot;friends&quot; are genuinely trying to help him, or taking advantage of him and his condition.I can't really go into any more detail without giving away certain plot elements.

Unfortunately, I think the precept probably never actually made its way onto the screenwriter's desk.The film makers wanted to do something different by starting at the end and moving the the beginning.  Well, I guess they did something that hadn't been done before.  Perhaps they should have thought a little about why it hadn't been done before.  The sum effect for me was simply irritating, as I was forced to watch the same footage over and over again, as it eventually lengthened to the beginning (which was actually at the end).  Did you get all that?The acting was ok, but who cares in a movie so annoying and stupid.  Don't buy this movie, don't even bother to watch.

542058,A2I29YY8T7PVLZ,B00003CXZ3,the_frog,"[3, 4]","First things first:The movie:Memento is an ingenious film center on the life of Leonard Shelby, a brain-damaged widower who obstensibly lost his ability to form new long-term memories when his wife was raped and presumably murdered. The caveats in that previous sentence are result of the film's storytelling which do not allow a viewer to take ANYTHING presented onscreen for granted. The movie immediately sets you in Leonard's world as it is presented in a succession of 5-10 minute flashbacks, which chop your own knowledge of events into segments like Leonard lives. It is this unusual presentation that drives the movie. What would otherwise be a relatively dull plot is brilliantly revealed in turns and twists in this presentation. The distortion of time becomes the primary narrative device, rather than a cheap gimmick, and truly makes Memento a better movie. The acting in the film is good though not brilliant, with the best work coming from those around an above-average Guy Pierce.Generally viewers either love or despise this film's ultimate plot, but no one disputes it's creativity. This film's heart is black at best, and takes a decidedly bleak and utilitarian outlook. While it will not change anyone's life, it does deal a massive narrative twist, the biggest in a long series of reverses and shifted angles.Ultimately, though, if you see the movie once, you will want and need to see it again, and likely again. It is simply impossible to take everything in on the first viewing, because you simply don't learn enough to catch the import of every detail. Which is why one would want the DVD.Which brings us to this very unusual disc. The packaging itself, which mimic a patient's file at a mental hospital, sheds light on the enigmatic Leonard Shelby and his past.  The package also provide some hidden instructions for viewing the first disc. The menus on the disc are presented as a series of slides from a mental competence exam, but an extremely strange one whose questions are not always answerable. The first disc has a few hints that point at the various sub-menus. This brings us to the second disc.The second disc is similar to the first, with the same moving slides of the exam, but is completely without instructions or even hints of any kind. The viewer is forced to paw around confusedly looking to see what special features they might stumble upon. This is an artistic decision that borders on cruel, but fits with the overall ethos of the film. Hidden among the many unanswerable questions is a version of the film with all the scenes in chronological order, which does much to deepen your understanding of the film, should you find it (or, like me, look up how to get there on the Internet)While the second disc fits the overall artist approach of the film, it is frankly an unacceptible case of viewer torture. The features are worth finding, but not worth the huge investment it would take to do so. But I am sure Chris Nolan loves that I react so strongly to it. Because it is a tremendous movie, and the special features are unique and very good, I give the disc the 5-star rating, but ONLY because the needless complexity of the second disc can be beaten by an Internet connection.",5,"Outstanding film, cruelly funny DVD",1073952000,"01 13, 2004",2004,3224,"['First', 'things', 'first', 'movie', 'Memento', 'ingenious', 'film', 'center', 'life', 'Leonard', 'Shelby', 'brain-damaged', 'widower', 'who', 'obstensibly', 'lost', 'ability', 'form', 'new', 'long-term', 'memories', 'when', 'wife', 'was', 'raped', 'presumably', 'murdered', 'caveats', 'previous', 'sentence', 'are', 'result', 'film', 'storytelling', 'do', 'not', 'allow', 'viewer', 'take', 'ANYTHING', 'presented', 'onscreen', 'granted', 'movie', 'immediately', 'Leonard', 'world', 'presented', 'succession', '5-10', 'minute', 'flashbacks', 'chop', 'own', 'knowledge', 'events', 'segments', 'Leonard', 'unusual', 'presentation', 'movie', 'What', 'would', 'otherwise', 'be', 'relatively', 'dull', 'plot', 'brilliantly', 'revealed', 'turns', 'twists', 'presentation', 'distortion', 'time', 'primary', 'narrative', 'device', 'rather', 'cheap', 'gimmick', 'truly', 'Memento', 'better', 'movie', 'acting', 'film', 'good', 'not', 'brilliant', 'best', 'work', 'coming', 'above-average', 'Guy', 'Pierce.Generally', 'viewers', 'love', 'despise', 'film', 'ultimate', 'plot', 'one', 'creativity', 'film', 'heart', 'black', 'best', 'decidedly', 'bleak', 'utilitarian', 'outlook', 'will', 'not', 'change', 'anyone', 'life', 'deal', 'massive', 'narrative', 'twist', 'biggest', 'long', 'series', 'reverses', 'shifted', 'angles.Ultimately', 'though', 'see', 'movie', 'once', 'will', 'want', 'need', 'see', 'again', 'likely', 'again', 'simply', 'impossible', 'take', 'everything', 'first', 'viewing', 'simply', 'do', ""n't"", 'learn', 'enough', 'catch', 'import', 'detail', 'Which', 'why', 'one', 'would', 'want', 'DVD.Which', 'very', 'unusual', 'disc', 'packaging', 'patient', 'file', 'mental', 'hospital', 'sheds', 'light', 'enigmatic', 'Leonard', 'Shelby', 'past', 'package', 'also', 'provide', 'hidden', 'instructions', 'viewing', 'first', 'disc', 'menus', 'disc', 'are', 'presented', 'series', 'slides', 'mental', 'competence', 'exam', 'extremely', 'strange', 'one', 'questions', 'are', 'not', 'always', 'answerable', 'first', 'disc', 'few', 'hints', 'point', 'various', 'sub-menus', 'second', 'disc.The', 'second', 'disc', 'similar', 'first', 'same', 'moving', 'slides', 'exam', 'completely', 'instructions', 'even', 'hints', 'kind', 'viewer', 'forced', 'paw', 'around', 'confusedly', 'looking', 'see', 'what', 'special', 'features', 'might', 'stumble', 'upon', 'artistic', 'decision', 'borders', 'cruel', 'overall', 'ethos', 'film', 'Hidden', 'many', 'unanswerable', 'questions', 'version', 'film', 'scenes', 'chronological', 'order', 'much', 'deepen', 'understanding', 'film', 'should', 'find', 'look', 'up', 'how', 'get', 'there', 'Internet', 'second', 'disc', 'overall', 'artist', 'approach', 'film', 'frankly', 'unacceptible', 'case', 'viewer', 'torture', 'features', 'are', 'worth', 'finding', 'not', 'huge', 'investment', 'would', 'take', 'do', 'so', 'am', 'sure', 'Chris', 'Nolan', 'react', 'so', 'strongly', 'tremendous', 'movie', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'unique', 'very', 'good', 'give', 'disc', '5-star', 'rating', 'ONLY', 'needless', 'complexity', 'second', 'disc', 'can', 'be', 'beaten', 'Internet', 'connection']",Memento VHS

The lead character, Lenny (Guy Pearce - is excellent) has anterograde amnesia, and is seeking revenge for his injury and his wife's murder. He is only cognizant of brief spans of the present, before his short term memory is lost. The film is edited to instill this same feeling of uncertainty of facts, relationships, and self-trust in the viewer. The story unfolds backwards, in brief spans, in a way that grabs your interest in the unravelling, like a top-notch mystery. This is the type of movie that has you still thinking about it hours after it is over. If you love mystery thrillers, or like studying films, this film is a must.My only disappointment is that the DVD did not have a director commentary audio track. However, it did include an IFC Interview with the director, Christopher Nolan. This includes some insights into this film, the festival showings, and the relationship between this film and his brother's short story. Other extras are ""ok"" -- trailers, and a lot of handwritten notes, stills, and a newspaper article hyperlinked together...largely a time-vampire, much effort you'll spend to get very little insight. The IFC interview was the only good DVD extra.This is an independent film that leaped from the festivals to the big screens, which is rare. Cinematography, multi-layered story, editing, and acting are the reason for it's success. Supporting actors are Carrie-Anne Moss and Joe Pantoliano (both from Matrix), are excellent. It does have many small twists, including the ending. The twists are non-Hollywood enough that you don't guess most of them.

""Memento"" deserves a place among those films: it's the most complex, original, innovative, intriguing achievement to hit the big screen in a while.  ""Memento"" looks like an ordinary film noir, having all the conventional elements (femme fatale, unreliable characters, ambiguous protagonist/narrator, bleak ending), until is fatally strikes you with its originality and audacity, making you unable to stop watching.  Director Christopher Nolan manages to pull off a rare feat in the film business these days by taking the entire industry by storm with his incredible intelligent, disjointed thriller ""Memento"".  While many films have since tried to imitate its taut script and superb execuation, it remains one fo the most unique and thought-provoking pieces of the past decade.From the beginning you realize you're not watching the usual thriller: the reversed opening sequence is a fascinating narrative choice, and even more fascinating is the director's decision to tell the whole story backwards, with each separate scene ending where the previous one began. Thanks to this trick, the audience is as confused as the movie's main character, Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce), a peculiar DIY detective who wants to find the bloke who raped and killed his wife (CSI's Jorja Fox). While attempting to save his wife during the attack, ""Lenny"" sustained a head injury and has lost his short-term memory, so every new event is gone from his mind after 10 minutes. He has to go on with his life by taking notes, snapping Polaroids and putting tattoos all over his body. He also gets some valuable help from a cop, ""Teddy"" (Joe Pantoliano), and a barmaid, Natalie (Carrie-Anne Moss). But should he really trust them, given he can't almost even trust himself due to his neurological condition.  Nolan (who screenwrote the film as well) knows how to build up the tension, as well as add emotion, with the touching parallel story of Sammy Jankis (Stephen Tobolowsky), a man with the same disease as Leonard.Both Pearce and Tobolowsky are superb as the two troubled men: the former makes you feel as uneasy as he does almost immediately, and he's got some really ace lines (""How am I supposed to heal if I can't feel time?""); the latter, on the other hand, is heartbreaking, his experiences make us wanna cry before the film's over. Pantoliano and Moss are very impressive too, their true intentions remaining unclear until the end.  Nolan beautifully intertwines the present and the past, linking events together like a detective putting all the clues together until the thief is found.  While ""Memento"" is thoroughly composed with its intertwining plot, the film's great strength can also be considered it potential flaw. The confusion that is inevitable can make it difficult for some to follow, especially for those who are used to a film flowing over them in a passive way. Memento requires you to exercise your brain and even when it is all over certain questions will still remain and further viewing is essential.  Of course, the central paradox of the film should not be forgotten, this is a revenge story but of course the character has now way of remembering the actual crime, his memory is gone and the memory of the act of revenge will also be a fleeting one.  Nolan's story and the ensemble cast's acting are outstanding, but a mention also has to go to the cinematography and soundtrack that both helped greatly to create the oppressive mood that pervaded throughout he film and is essential to generate the sense of fragility that exists in Leonard's connection to the world.  An intelligent, profound, and supreme addition to the genre.

542065,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B00003CXZ3,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[4, 4]","As I left the theater, my mind clouded with all of the images and story of the film, I realized that I had seen a great addition to the film noir canon. I pass the line of people waiting for the next showing.The film ends and the lights come up. Wow! Wow spelled backwards is still Wow! I get up and leave the packed independent theater.I have heard a lot of good things about ""Memento"", the new noir film from writer - director Christopher Nolan, and I am not disappointed. Movies like ""Memento"" are perhaps the hardest to write about. I have to be careful to not give away anything. Anything at all. If I do, I will rob a moviegoer of a potential surprise.Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce) is in the middle of a mystery. He is trying to find the man who raped and murdered his wife (Gorga Fox). Leonard has a problem that further complicates this mission. The trauma of his wife's death has robbed him of any short-term memory. He can remember who his wife is, how to drive a car, etc., but anything that occurs to create a new memory will be forgotten. Leonard must rely on notes, tattoos on his body and Polaroids of his friends, enemies, places he lives, etc. He can't talk to people for very long, because he will ultimately forget who they are. He can't talk to people on the phone, because he has to see their eyes, a skill he learned as a former insurance investigator. During his investigation, he meets Natalie (Carrie-Ann Moss) and Teddy (Joe Pantoliano), two people that may or may not be his allies.If ""Memento"" were laid out in a typical chronological fashion, it would be an interesting film with some good performances. Christopher Nolan, the writer and director, decided to tell the film backwards. The first indication of this is the first shot of a Polaroid undeveloping. We see a picture of a man's body in the corner of a deserted room. The hand holding the photo shakes it a few times, it becomes lighter. Shakes it a few more times, and so on, until the picture pops out of the camera. We then see the climax of the film first, shocking us into the film's different reality. As the film rewinds, we see Leonard slowly unraveling the mystery that leads up to the climax and the detours that he takes along the way. Each segment of the story is just a few minutes in length, the length of Leonard's memory. This helps the audience really feel for Leonard's plight. We essentially have the same problem Leonard does. We don't know what happened before, so everything is new to us, just as it is to Leonard. This construction is really brilliant and it is a testament to the skill of Nolan that the film does not seem as gimmicky as I just described it. We quickly buy into the world he has created and it seems natural.To provide a break from the rewinding story, Nolan inserts an ongoing telephone conversation between Leonard and an unseen caller between each of the short segments. In chronological fashion, Leonard recounts the story of his most important case as an insurance investigator, the case of Sammy Jankis (Stephen Tobolowsky), a man with a very similar case of short-term memory loss, and his wife, Mrs. Jankis (Harriet Sansom Harris). The story of Sammy Jankis provides a very human aspect to the story and allows us to see Leonard as a normal human being. The story also helps us to understand Leonard's plight.Guy Pearce is simply phenomenal. In each brief segment, he has to start each by figuring our what is going on, trying to figure out if the people around him are helping him or should be avoided. It doesn't sound like the character would allow a lot of time for development or allow the audience time to identify with him, but Pearce makes it happen. Because he is used to the problem, he knows to act quickly. He makes the character work hard throughout to find the source of the mystery. The scenes when he is on the telephone, recounting the story of Sammy Jankis also help to humanize the character. Much of the flashbacks present a different Leonard, providing a nice counterpoint.Carrie-Ann Moss is very good as the required Noir femme fatale. She has a simply amazing couple of scenes in the middle of the film during which we quickly see who she is, what her role is and how deeply Leonard's problem affects him. She is a very strong character. Joe Pantoliano plays Teddy, Leonard's ally. Leonard plays along with Teddy despite the Polaroid in his pocket labeling Teddy a liar. Teddy is a very complex character who likes to talk and he talks a lot. During his many conversations, he also takes advantage of Leonard's problem.""Memento"" is a very memorable film, sure to delight you with its twists and turns.The house lights go down as the last minute stragglers try to find seats.I read the newspaper, waiting for the film to start.I buy my ticket very early. I know from the buzz that I need to buy my ticket early. A lot of people will want to see the film tonight.I do not mind paying full price for my ticket.

Unlike Dory in Finding Nemo, however, Shelby's condition is not used for comic relief.  Instead, the story weaves its way in and out of Shelby's in-the-moment sense of reality, bringing him into contact with a variety of interesting characters, most of whom viciously manipulate him.Joe Pantoliano and Carrie-Ann Moss (of Matrix fame) both play supporting roles, as does CSI/ER veteran Jorja Fox.

What is troubling isn't so much the film but the passionate reverence of its fans.  For thousands of years, artists have striven to find forms with which the incoherence and complexity of ""reality"" can be communicated to people.  In the best art, a kind of sublime simplicity is achieved.  Now, we are giving birth to a new form: the puzzle film.  This genre seems to propose that chopping up time and skewing perception can take us further towards understanding the world than conventional means can.  But this is a false idea:  in the end these puzzle films work best only as mind games.  Any aesthetic connection to deeper ideas is really just gravy.  ""Babel"" was perhaps the most corrupt example:  at its heart was a ridiculously contrived matinee thriller masquerading as an indie art film.  ""Memento"" is more of a Borges story elaborated to epic proportions.  Fascinating, yes.  Brilliant at times, perhaps.  But, in the end a bauble for people who like to stare at baubles thinking themselves wise for doing so. The ""profound"" content about identity, projection, etc. really could have been explored with less fuss.  The film may one day be viewed as a symptom of our inability to make sense of our lives in a fractured moment in time, an example of our social illness rather than a work of art.  And a depressing experience, to boot.  Baroque, in the worst sense, in that it will inspire a whole new generation of fan boys to invent ever more clever and complicated toys with which to engage the minds of their ""soul"" mates.Still, hats off to the filmmakers and cast for an impressive, if dubious achievement:  this is probably the best film of its genre.Addendum,  2011:  By now, after ""Inception,""  Christopher Nolan has revealed the full measure of his mediocrity.

The movie is told in forward flashes of events that are to come that compensate for his unreliable memory, during which he has liaisons with various complex characters.

The thought of losing one's mind is quite frightening and is the premise for the movie MEMENTO.In MEMENTO, Guy Pearce (L.A. CONFIDENTIAL) plays Leonard ""Lenny"" Shely, a man who is trying to track down his wife's killer. However, Leonard has no short term memory. He can remember everything until his wife's murder, but then his mind is a blank. He meets a new person and within five minutes, he forgets. He goes somewhere then forgets where he's at and why he's there. To help himself survive, Leonard takes Polaroid pictures of everything and writes important details on the back. However, the most important pieces of information he gets tatooed on his body. Lenny's tired of living this way, but must keep on until he finds his wife's killer.Pearce's performance catches all the nuances of a man who has literally lost his mind. And Carrie-Anne Moss (Matrix) and Joe Pantoliano pull off superb performances in their major supporting roles.Christopher Nolan's direction is pure genius. The story of MEMENTO is told backwards. At first the idea seems absurd, but it works brilliantly.

Had it been produced for a televisionanthology program (were there any anthology programs tobe found on television, alas), it would've blown itsviewers away presented at the length of fifty minutes.As a feature film, however, it is nothing more than adiverting, clever, but mostly mechanical exercise oftenstretched beyond its means to entertain.You'll spend the first ten minute or so becomingacclimated to the inverted nature of the film.  Fromthere you'll spend another ten or twenty guessing thesurprise climax you know is coming (by the halfway markI had concocted five possible resolutions, one of whichproved true).  But from thence on, as you might expect,you become not a little impatient for the film to playout.  Tightened and cut by thirty percent, `Memento'would moved at such a breakneck pace that its relativelyfamiliar crime-story situations and characters would nothave hurt it any.

It is original, superbly acted and brilliantly edited together for a unique viewing experience.  The premise of the movie is that Leonard (Guy Pierce)is trying to find the men who raped and murdered his wife.  Unfortunately, he was hit on the head by the men who assaulted his wife and now he has only a long term memory and his short term memory fades after five minutes or so (meaning he can't make new memories).  He copes with this by writing himself notes on paper, pictures and even tatooing certain bits of information onto his body.  The style in which the film explains the story is brilliant, as another way of developing such a unique character would have proven inadequate.  The movie starts at the ending and works it way to what normally would be the beginning. While it goes about it in this fashion the plot unfolds and we are introduced to various characters that all interact/affect the main character (Guy Pierce) in some way.  The question is...who is truly a friend and who is an enemy?  All is revealed in the movies satisfying and unexpected ending (er, beginning).  Memento is a creative and intellingent story that is crafted brilliantly and assisted further by stellar performances from all the movie's players.  After watching it, you can't help but get philosophical and try to divulge some deeper meaning from the film and life in general.  I know I've been pondering something.  If Leonard can't make new memories since the incident, then how is it that throughout the movie, anytime he meets someone, he always tells that he has this condition and can't make new memories?

The second time, it was more focused and geared toward the plot and ideas, felt more in synchronisation with this rather bold and complex storyline. For starters, the Nolan fandom (popularity rose after The Dark Knight) has not been a part differing myself from the friend who had a copy of this DVD (who says this is his favourite film). First off, the idea that it is a favourite is nothing to be ashamed of. Memento has something elusive and cryptic about its ideas and thoughts and leaves for multiple discussion and dissecting of particular scenes (in addition, the cinematography, performances, Hans Zimmer-esque soundtrack, indie feel/credibility, and Hitchcockian/Fincher-esque vibes that ring true in this film are prevalent!, esp. in the case of films like Se7en, Blackmail, and Vertigo). Guy Pearce, who plays Leonard/Lenny, steps in the jacket of a James Stewart-type figure arguing for interpretations and perspective of the murder of his wife which sounds about as paranoid/schizophrenic as his short-term memory loss character Leonard as in Vertigo where he idolises a dead body. Trippy, enigmatic, and quite disturbing at moments- this is uncompromising, complex, and without clear elaboration, inventive all the way especially considering it has no source material from a book but through a brotherly bond through Jonathan (Chris' brother) Nolan too in the form of a short story. In all respect, this film is surprisingly more superior than Inception and The Dark Knight Rises given its source material, its foundation, and credentials. While difficult on many corners, it feels more closely knit and compact in scope with many discussion-heavy elements than his more commercial features.""",4,Serves to point out that Nolan (of Batman fame) can be a neo-Hitchcock too!,1358899200,"01 23, 2013",2013,1847,"['first', 'time', 'watching', 'felt', 'more', 'confusing', 'long', 'run', 'many', 'seeing', 'were', 'inattentive', 'willing', 'talk', 'silly', 'quibs', 'second', 'time', 'was', 'more', 'focused', 'geared', 'plot', 'ideas', 'felt', 'more', 'synchronisation', 'rather', 'bold', 'complex', 'storyline', 'starters', 'Nolan', 'fandom', 'popularity', 'rose', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'not', 'been', 'part', 'differing', 'friend', 'who', 'had', 'copy', 'DVD', 'who', 'favourite', 'film', 'First', 'idea', 'favourite', 'nothing', 'be', 'ashamed', 'Memento', 'something', 'elusive', 'cryptic', 'ideas', 'thoughts', 'leaves', 'multiple', 'discussion', 'dissecting', 'particular', 'scenes', 'addition', 'cinematography', 'performances', 'Zimmer-esque', 'soundtrack', 'indie', 'feel/credibility', 'Hitchcockian/Fincher-esque', 'vibes', 'ring', 'true', 'film', 'are', 'prevalent', 'esp', 'case', 'films', 'Se7en', 'Blackmail', 'Vertigo', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'who', 'Leonard/Lenny', 'steps', 'jacket', 'James', 'Stewart-type', 'figure', 'arguing', 'interpretations', 'perspective', 'murder', 'wife', 'as', 'paranoid/schizophrenic', 'short-term', 'memory', 'loss', 'character', 'Leonard', 'Vertigo', 'where', 'dead', 'body', 'Trippy', 'enigmatic', 'quite', 'disturbing', 'moments-', 'uncompromising', 'complex', 'clear', 'elaboration', 'inventive', 'way', 'especially', 'considering', 'source', 'material', 'book', 'brotherly', 'bond', 'Jonathan', 'Chris', 'brother', 'Nolan', 'too', 'form', 'short', 'story', 'respect', 'film', 'surprisingly', 'more', 'superior', 'Inception', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'Rises', 'given', 'source', 'material', 'foundation', 'credentials', 'difficult', 'many', 'corners', 'more', 'closely', 'knit', 'compact', 'scope', 'many', 'discussion-heavy', 'elements', 'more', 'commercial', 'features']",Memento VHS

The film starts out with Joe Pantaliano (Teddy a.k.a. John G.) being killed by Guy Pearce.  Don't worry, that's not a spoiler.  The reason it is not is because the movie runs backwards.  The scenes in color are the things playing backwards.  The reason for this is that the real twists of the movie are revealed at the beginning of the story.  I was absolutely SHOCKED at the end.  Really, this movie is a classic when it comes to suspense and originality.The synopsis is sort of confusing within the movie, but the basics are quite comprehendable.  Guy Pearce's character has a memory problem, therefore not allowing him to know who to trust and who not to trust, as he cannot form new memories of people, places and things.  He has to write down everything and take pictures of every person.  This also adds to the interest of the movie.  But essentially, he is trying to discover who raped and murdered his wife, his last memory.Guy Pearce was phenominal, and deserved a 2001 Oscar nomination.  He really was powerful, conveying a memory problem most people probably could not even begin to fathom having to live with.  Joe Pantaliano plays the &quot;bad guy&quot; very well.  He makes you dislike him, much like he did in The Matrix.  He has proved time and time again that he is a wonderful talent.  Carrie-Anne Moss was alright as Guy Pearce's confidant of sorts.  She basically runs a bar and helps him find John G., the alleged killer of his wife.  I do often notice how she is a good character actress.  I have seen her in three movies: The Matrix, this movie, and one of my favorites, Chocolat.  In each movie she really plays the specific characteristics of each person well.  For instance, her seriousness and love for Neo in The Matrix was just right.  And her extreme &quot;uptightness&quot; in Chocolat really made you angry.  I used to dislike her acting somewhat, but now respect her after seeing more of her work.

MEMENTO starts at the end, but is anything but common, because it then progresses backward in time.  Each 5 to 10 min. segment (shot in color) occurs at a point in time just prior to the one before.  Interspersed within this reverse narrative are B&amp;W scenes in chronological order which, if all put together, lead up to the final segment, which is the beginning of the story.  How could something that sounds so confusing make a watchable film, you might ask?  It's a tribute to screenwriter/director Nolan that he created such a compelling and thought-provoking mystery/thriller from such a framework.  It's rare to find an unconventional approach to film making that really works..and this does.Guy Pierce is excellent in the role of Lenny, a man who has suffered a severe head injury while trying to defend his wife against an attack by burglars.  This injury has left him incapable of making new memories; he retains nothing for more than 5 or 10 mins.  He can't watch a half hour TV show because by the end, he's forgotten how it started.  His condition is not amnesia; he knows who he is and recalls everything about his life before the injury.  His brain simply won't retain any new experiences.Lenny's wife was raped and murdered by her attackers, leaving him devastated and filled with rage.  A police investigation turned up a suspect known only as &quot;John G.&quot;  Of course, Lenny's injury would quickly cause him to forget all of this, so he has his chest tattooed with &quot;John G. raped and murdered my wife&quot;.  His quest to find and kill  the man who ruined his life is what gives him purpose.  In order to function, he is constantly taking Polaroids and making notes to refer back to after he's forgotten.  The most important clues that he uncovers he has tattooed all over his body.  Lenny's mission is complicated by two people with ulterior motives who take advantage of his dysfunction.  One is Teddy (Pantoliano), a cop helping him find the killer; the other is Natalie (Moss), a woman he meets along the way who he thinks may be able to help him.Christopher Nolan adapted the screenplay (which was nominated for an Oscar) from a short story by his brother, Jonathan Nolan.  The genius of the script is that it mimics Lenny's handicap in that the viewer doesn't know what preceded the current scene, just as Lenny doesn't know because he's forgotten!  It raises intriguing questions about the role of memory in our perception of reality.  At one point, Lenny is thinking out loud about his predicament.  He wonders how many times he's been reminded and forgotten that his wife is gone.  Imagine learning that a loved one has died, over and over, each time as if it were the first.  &quot;How can I heal if I can't feel time?&quot;  How can he trust others that he only knows through scribbled notes on photographs?  In a surprise revelation near the end of the film, we find that Lenny can't really &quot;know&quot; anything because he can't even trust himself.  Because this film is so unconventional and tough to fully absorb in one viewing, some impatient folks will consider it a waste of time.  But MEMENTO is extremely well made (Oscar nominated for Best Film Editing) and well worth the effort for anyone who appreciates film as art and is not intimidated by complexity.",5,&quot;How can I heal if I can't feel time?&quot;,1066780800,"10 22, 2003",2003,3435,"['not', 'uncommon', 'film', 'start', 'end', 'story', 'then', 'explain', 'flashback', 'what', 'led', 'up', 'moment', 'MEMENTO', 'end', 'anything', 'common', 'then', 'backward', 'time', '5', '10', 'min', 'segment', 'shot', 'color', 'point', 'time', 'just', 'prior', 'one', 'Interspersed', 'reverse', 'narrative', 'are', 'B', 'amp', 'W', 'scenes', 'chronological', 'order', 'put', 'together', 'lead', 'final', 'segment', 'beginning', 'story', 'How', 'could', 'something', 'so', 'confusing', 'make', 'watchable', 'film', 'might', 'ask', 'tribute', 'screenwriter/director', 'Nolan', 'created', 'compelling', 'thought-provoking', 'mystery/thriller', 'such', 'framework', 'rare', 'find', 'unconventional', 'approach', 'film', 'making', 'really', 'works..and', 'does.Guy', 'Pierce', 'excellent', 'role', 'Lenny', 'man', 'who', 'suffered', 'severe', 'head', 'injury', 'trying', 'defend', 'wife', 'attack', 'burglars', 'injury', 'left', 'incapable', 'making', 'new', 'memories', 'nothing', 'more', '5', '10', 'mins', 'ca', ""n't"", 'watch', 'half', 'hour', 'TV', 'show', 'end', 'forgotten', 'how', 'started', 'condition', 'not', 'amnesia', 'who', 'everything', 'life', 'injury', 'brain', 'simply', 'wo', ""n't"", 'retain', 'new', 'experiences.Lenny', 'wife', 'was', 'raped', 'murdered', 'attackers', 'leaving', 'devastated', 'filled', 'rage', 'police', 'investigation', 'turned', 'up', 'suspect', 'known', 'only', 'quot', 'John', 'G.', 'quot', 'course', 'Lenny', 'injury', 'would', 'quickly', 'cause', 'forget', 'chest', 'tattooed', 'quot', 'John', 'G.', 'raped', 'murdered', 'wife', 'quot', 'quest', 'find', 'kill', 'man', 'who', 'ruined', 'life', 'what', 'purpose', 'order', 'function', 'constantly', 'taking', 'Polaroids', 'making', 'notes', 'refer', 'back', 'forgotten', 'most', 'important', 'clues', 'tattooed', 'body', 'Lenny', 'mission', 'complicated', 'two', 'people', 'ulterior', 'motives', 'who', 'take', 'advantage', 'dysfunction', 'One', 'Teddy', 'Pantoliano', 'cop', 'helping', 'find', 'killer', 'other', 'Natalie', 'Moss', 'woman', 'way', 'who', 'may', 'be', 'able', 'help', 'him.Christopher', 'Nolan', 'adapted', 'screenplay', 'was', 'nominated', 'Oscar', 'short', 'story', 'brother', 'Jonathan', 'Nolan', 'genius', 'script', 'Lenny', 'handicap', 'viewer', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'preceded', 'current', 'scene', 'just', 'Lenny', ""n't"", 'know', 'forgotten', 'intriguing', 'questions', 'role', 'memory', 'perception', 'reality', 'one', 'point', 'Lenny', 'thinking', 'out', 'loud', 'predicament', 'how', 'many', 'times', 'been', 'reminded', 'forgotten', 'wife', 'gone', 'Imagine', 'learning', 'loved', 'one', 'died', 'over', 'time', 'were', 'first', 'quot', 'How', 'can', 'heal', 'ca', ""n't"", 'feel', 'time', 'quot', 'How', 'can', 'trust', 'others', 'only', 'scribbled', 'notes', 'photographs', 'surprise', 'revelation', 'end', 'film', 'find', 'Lenny', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'quot', 'quot', 'anything', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'trust', 'film', 'so', 'unconventional', 'tough', 'fully', 'absorb', 'one', 'viewing', 'impatient', 'folks', 'will', 'consider', 'waste', 'time', 'MEMENTO', 'extremely', 'well', 'made', 'Oscar', 'nominated', 'Best', 'Film', 'Editing', 'well', 'effort', 'anyone', 'who', 'film', 'art', 'not', 'intimidated', 'complexity']",Memento VHS

Christopher Nolan succeeds at this daunting task.Guy Pearce, Joe Pantoliano and Carrie-Anne Moss do terrific work. Essentially an ugly film on multiple levels Pearce in particular creates a memorable person who has short term memory loss. Excuse the play on words but his performance is essential to pulling off the backward plot convention. Joe Pantoliano's character Teddy is immediately (the word greasy comes to mind) not likeable although we do not find out exactly the nature of his relationship with Leonard until the film unfolds it's twists and turns. Similarly Carrie-Anne Moss's Natalie is cleverly plotted and the general theme of the film is equally well concieved and developed. Memento's themes take a bit of time to develop besides the obvious short term memory loss. I won't discuss the themes as they are best seen and experienced by the viewer.Christopher Nolan's dual screenwriter/director duties serve him well as he allows his cast to work with the material and feed off one another, not a simple thing to do when every scene is essentially new to Leonard also called 'Lenny!'.The city is generic enough and the look of the film is mostly seedy, film noir. The pace is fast and the script tight. You care for Leonard as his life unravels like a backwards train wreck and in the end you are left stunned.Exceptional overall filmmaking and acting.",5,Unique Plot Convention Done Well,1045872000,"02 22, 2003",2003,1553,"['idea', 'creating', 'story', 'end', 'beginning', 'not', 'new.To', 'create', 'convincing', 'film', 'ending', 'make', 'worth', 'watching', 'much', 'harder', 'film', 'paper', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'daunting', 'task.Guy', 'Pearce', 'Joe', 'Pantoliano', 'Carrie-Anne', 'Moss', 'do', 'terrific', 'work', 'Essentially', 'ugly', 'film', 'multiple', 'levels', 'Pearce', 'particular', 'creates', 'memorable', 'person', 'who', 'short', 'term', 'memory', 'loss', 'play', 'words', 'performance', 'essential', 'pulling', 'off', 'backward', 'plot', 'convention', 'Joe', 'Pantoliano', 'character', 'Teddy', 'immediately', 'word', 'greasy', 'mind', 'not', 'likeable', 'do', 'not', 'find', 'out', 'exactly', 'nature', 'relationship', 'Leonard', 'film', 'twists', 'turns', 'Similarly', 'Carrie-Anne', 'Moss', 'Natalie', 'cleverly', 'plotted', 'general', 'theme', 'film', 'equally', 'well', 'concieved', 'developed', 'Memento', 'themes', 'take', 'bit', 'time', 'develop', 'obvious', 'short', 'term', 'memory', 'loss', 'wo', ""n't"", 'discuss', 'themes', 'are', 'best', 'seen', 'experienced', 'viewer.Christopher', 'Nolan', 'dual', 'screenwriter/director', 'duties', 'serve', 'well', 'cast', 'work', 'material', 'feed', 'off', 'one', 'not', 'simple', 'thing', 'do', 'when', 'scene', 'essentially', 'new', 'Leonard', 'also', 'called', ""'Lenny"", ""'.The"", 'city', 'generic', 'enough', 'look', 'film', 'mostly', 'seedy', 'film', 'noir', 'pace', 'fast', 'script', 'tight', 'care', 'Leonard', 'life', 'unravels', 'backwards', 'train', 'wreck', 'end', 'are', 'left', 'stunned.Exceptional', 'overall', 'filmmaking', 'acting']",Memento VHS

Remarkably, however, I somehow missed this incredible piece of film-making until now.For a basic plot summary, ""Memento"" tells the story of an amnesiac who cannot remember short-term events.  He knows who is and basic tenants of his life, but the day-to-day details reset from time to time.  Thus, this film is devoted to him trying to avenge his wife's killing and putting together the pieces of his confusing identity.There is not other way to describe this movie apart from saying there are few like it.  The closest comparison would be to ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"", but ""Memento"" is better at that game.  The story is told in such a unique fashion that it will keep you guessing (but in a good way) until the very end.  The acting is also solid and makes you truly care about the 2-3 core characters.Perhaps the greatest compliment I can give this film, however, is that it accomplishes the feat of bending the mind yet ultimately creating a remarkably cohesive overall story.  I was taken on a psychological adventure and given an ending worthy of the journey.  You won't be left hanging, that is for sure.Thus, ""Memento"" is now firmly ensconced on my ""Top Films"" list.  There's nothing it fails at, while succeeding at so many other things.

542109,A318RKL1I9ABCM,B00003CXZ3,"""zaloop""","[15, 18]","As of this writing, the subject of this review, Memento, is probably the best film of 2001.Leonard Shelby has a rare form of short-term amnesia; he can't form new memories. The only thing he does remember is everything in his life up to the night his wife was raped and killed by an anonymous assailant who gave Leonard the head injury that caused his condition. Now Leonard is obsessed with finding him, despite his handicap. He writes notes to himself, takes pictures of important people and places, and even tattoos important facts on his body. He will not give up, even as he wakes up every day not knowing what happened the day before.With a premise like the one written above, do you really need to read the rest of this review to convince yourself that you simply must go see this movie? The possibilities for great suspense and mystery should be obvious from the premise just given. Memento has the perfect concept for a wonderful mystery, and takes advantage of it through the structure, which is unique, engaging, and central to the film's method of bringing the viewer in. One of the important questions for the film would be, How can it tell the story in an interesting way, and at the same time let us in on Leonard Shelby's world? How can it give us an idea of what it's like to be him? All these questions are solved in one fell swoop with the help of a great, non-linear plot structure.The film starts with a memorable image: a Polaroid being developed backwards, eventually being put back into the camera by our protagonist, Leonard Shelby, after he has shot someone. This first image sets up the style of the rest of the film: nonlinear and looping back onto itself, the film is split up into subsections of plot that take place after the one following it. So, in essence, we are being told the story backwards, with each subsequent section ending where the previous one began. It's a unique, engaging, and important method of storytelling this film employs, and it never gets confusing or unclear for the audience. Of course, Shelby lives in real time, in constant forward motion, not traveling further and further back in time like we are while watching the film. But in order to capture the essence of Shelby's existence, we have to be given the sensation of suddenly being thrust into a situation without knowing (or in Shelby's case, remembering) what has happened before. We have to be as clueless as he is. That is accomplished through Memento's structure. It's much more than a gimmick; it's a gateway into the protagonist's mind.From there, the film simply takes off, and never slows down. We are constantly kept alert and engaged in what's happening because we are as clueless as Leonard, and simply because the mystery is so great. His investigation for ""John G,"" the killer, is fascinating and leads to many twists, turns, new alliances, and back-stabbings. Just when you think you have it ""figured out"" (if you're foolish enough to really think so) the film takes a turn and opens up whole new possibilities.With the smoothness and grace of a film that knows it has a spectacular script, Memento introduces its various themes seamlessly into the main detective-story narrative. What is so immensely enjoyable about watching Memento is that it has so much thematic depth to it; all of the plot's twists and turns only serve to emphasize one of its many motifs. How far can someone rely on his or her memory of something until it starts to become distorted? Shelby's situation is so precarious because he is the most unreliable of narrators; the audience, following the story, is dependant on him for telling the story. Like a cancer, this realization is introduced in the viewer and grows as the film progresses. Shelby is a living, breathing personification of an intriguing philosophical question: can someone live without memory, by just knowing the facts about a situation and going on them? ""Memory is unreliable. Facts are the only thing you can count on,"" Shelby says. He lives that quote, for time doesn't exist for someone like Shelby. Since he can't be aware of the passage of time, not knowing where he has been or how long it's been since his wife died, time really has no meaning for him. His ""time"" is merely the short bursts of consciousness that flare up and die every day. Shelby's condition is one of the most tragic situations any protagonists in film have been in.The acting is, in a word, excellent, with Guy Pearce wrenchingly inhabiting this character. He's able to be charming, clueless, determined, and gruff all simultaneously. He is a detective trying to figure out the mystery but raging against the confines of his own mind, which prevent him from doing so. He talks to other characters in a polite and nice, but neutral manner, as if unsure whether or not he has actually talked to this person before but just doesn't remember it. It's a quietly intense performance, and the audience feels his pain through it.I end this review with a mention of the ending of the film. No spoilers here, but not only does it manage to surprise us, shock us, and put the entire story in a new perspective, but it also wrenches the sympathy out of us so naturally because of what it does to Leonard Shelby in terms of his development as a character. To say that we discover a new side of him is to put it lightly; we simultaneously cry out in horror and sympathy at the final, brutal revelation. To say anything more would be wrong. It is the perfect ending to a perfect movie.",5,Best film of 2001,1013472000,"02 12, 2002",2002,5519,"['writing', 'subject', 'review', 'Memento', 'probably', 'best', 'film', '2001.Leonard', 'Shelby',
