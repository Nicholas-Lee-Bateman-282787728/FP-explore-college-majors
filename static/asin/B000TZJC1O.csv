The Hymns are great and inspirational, but the singing is down, not up.  The title song is one of the most dreary versions ever sung.  Most, but not all the rest, do not move one.  They are slow and unmoving.  The picture quality is very poor; it looks as if it were made decades ago.  There is nothing live here.",2,Not a moving song fest.,1280361600,"07 29, 2010",2010,412,"['am', 'Gaither', 'fan', 'have', 'dozens', 'DVDs', 'DVD', 'however', 'worst', 'one', 'made', 'Hymns', 'are', 'great', 'inspirational', 'singing', 'down', 'not', 'up', 'title', 'song', 'one', 'most', 'dreary', 'versions', 'ever', 'sung', 'Most', 'not', 'rest', 'do', 'not', 'move', 'one', 'are', 'slow', 'unmoving', 'picture', 'quality', 'very', 'poor', 'were', 'made', 'decades', 'ago', 'nothing', 'live', 'here']",N/A

It is my aim to have most everything that Gaither puts out.  This is a good one, not my favorite, but I sort of knew what I was getting, and it is a good one to watch.So, which are my favorites?  I think there is no better recording than ""I Do Believe."" I say this, partially because it is one that can be watched again and again, without wanting to skip about. The singing is absolutely great. The humor is in good taste -and Mark is soo funny. The message is beautiful and very noticeable. ""Make it Real,"" is prefaced by a testimony by Mark Lowry, and the combination is most touching. David and Guy are at their breath-taking best, and Bill Gaither, being his usual professional self, picked a great location to have such a precious presentation.So! The reason I gave ""How Great Thou Art"" four stars, is because I gave ""I Do Believe,"" ""Australia Home Coming,"" and some others five stars. That is to say, four stars is still good.Mickey Thorne",4,Gaither Home Coming DVD,1301097600,"03 26, 2011",2011,1069,"['had', 'seen', 'portion', 'contents', 'TV', 'may', 'have', 'actually', 'seen', 'DVD', 'someone', 'did', 'not', 'own', 'one', 'aim', 'have', 'most', 'everything', 'Gaither', 'out', 'good', 'one', 'not', 'favorite', 'sort', 'knew', 'what', 'was', 'getting', 'good', 'one', 'watch.So', 'are', 'favorites', 'think', 'better', 'recording', 'Do', 'say', 'partially', 'one', 'can', 'be', 'watched', 'again', 'again', 'wanting', 'skip', 'about', 'singing', 'absolutely', 'great', 'humor', 'good', 'taste', '-and', 'Mark', 'soo', 'funny', 'message', 'beautiful', 'very', 'noticeable', 'Make', 'Real', 'prefaced', 'testimony', 'Mark', 'Lowry', 'combination', 'most', 'touching', 'David', 'Guy', 'are', 'breath-taking', 'best', 'Bill', 'Gaither', 'being', 'usual', 'professional', 'self', 'picked', 'great', 'location', 'have', 'such', 'precious', 'presentation.So', 'reason', 'gave', 'How', 'Great', 'Thou', 'Art', 'four', 'stars', 'gave', 'Do', 'Believe', 'Australia', 'Home', 'Coming', 'others', 'five', 'stars', 'say', 'four', 'stars', 'still', 'good.Mickey', 'Thorne']",N/A
