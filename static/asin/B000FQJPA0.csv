Lee. Both romantic and sensitive, it captures that joy we feel upon finally finding that someone where our heart can rest, and the gut-wrenching pain of watching them slip away before our pleading eyes.It begins as Kim Su-jin (Son Ye Jin) is trying to put her life back together after an embarrassing office affair with her married boss ends in heartbreak at a train station. She returns home to live with her family, her loving father understanding rather judgmental. His foreman, Choi Chul Soo (Jeong Woo Sung), a carpenter, meets her by chance at a mini-mart where she has forgotten the can of Coke she just purchased. When they meet again she is embarrassed, but when he comes to her rescue during a street robbery a sweet romance begins.There is humor and a wonderful sweetness to the couple's courtship missing in many films. That sense of longing and happiness just out of reach so prominent in Korean dramas will only gradually come into play as little by little Su-jin begins forgetting more and more and realizes something is wrong. Spanish love songs create a romantic and playful atmosphere during the first half of the romance which finally gives way to the film's lovely refrain during the heartbreaking latter half.Lee paints a very real love which makes this not only rise above tear-jerker status, but put it into the romantic masterpiece category. Son Ye Jin is both beautiful and wondrous in her performance, and in the latter portion, Jeong Woo Sung lends depth to a young man faced with a loss so great it might destroy his life. Their day-to-day hardships and romantic plans are intruded upon by a devastating illness one is not supposed to get at the age of twenty-seven.Their love and happiness as she quits her job and he leaves notes and pictures all over their house to remind her of things is quite emotional, but in a quiet way which the director never allows to become maudlin. When she realizes in a moment of clarity that she is breaking his heart she makes a decision which changes both their lives. But this film is not over, and its beautiful conclusion will choke you up and lift you up at the same time.This film is unforgettable, and will become a part of anyone who sees it. For any person with the capacity for love deeper than the surface, A Moment to Remember will touch your heart and spirit and never fade from memory. A must own film.",5,"""I don't have to remember you.

A Moment To Remember is a beautiful film that effectively captures happiness and pain.A Moment To Remember is a drama with a very powerful story, although you may have seen some of these elements before. The story begins with the focus being on the relationship they develop; Chul Soo and Su Jin come from different worlds but develop an authentic relationship, a relationship that feels real. Son Ye-jin and Jung Woo-sung did an amazing job in this film; they have great chemistry on camera which is the main reason the film feels authentic, since they can hit all of the right emotions. The film then unleashes the tragic Alzheimer's disease it teases throughout. Before this, you see and even experience happiness with the characters, now you feel the pain and agony that arrives with Alzheimer's disease; and it continues to hurt until the end. This one of the films that can really make you emotional for the right reasons. The ending was great, as well, so I won't spoil it. The music was also amazing and matched the tone of the film.Overall, A Moment To Remember is an effective drama thanks to the deep storyline and the superb performances. Another gem among the many from South Korea. As of 12/27/12, this film is available on Netflix Streaming, but a purchase is highly recommended.A Moment To Remember has some blood and violence, no sex or nudity.",5,A Beautiful Film Experience That Effectively Captures Happiness and Pain...,1357430400,"01 6, 2013",2013,1607,"['Moment', 'Remember', 'relationship', 'Su', 'Jin', 'young', 'forgetful', 'woman', 'Chul', 'Soo', 'young', 'man', 'troubled', 'past', 'film', 'importance', 'relationship', 'struggles', 'accompany', 'Alzheimer', 'disease', 'Moment', 'Remember', 'beautiful', 'film', 'effectively', 'happiness', 'pain.A', 'Moment', 'Remember', 'drama', 'very', 'powerful', 'story', 'may', 'have', 'seen', 'elements', 'story', 'focus', 'being', 'relationship', 'develop', 'Chul', 'Soo', 'Su', 'Jin', 'come', 'different', 'worlds', 'develop', 'authentic', 'relationship', 'relationship', 'real', 'Son', 'Ye-jin', 'Jung', 'Woo-sung', 'did', 'amazing', 'job', 'film', 'have', 'great', 'chemistry', 'camera', 'main', 'reason', 'film', 'feels', 'authentic', 'can', 'hit', 'right', 'emotions', 'film', 'then', 'tragic', 'Alzheimer', 'disease', 'see', 'even', 'experience', 'happiness', 'characters', 'now', 'feel', 'pain', 'agony', 'Alzheimer', 'disease', 'hurt', 'end', 'one', 'films', 'can', 'really', 'make', 'emotional', 'right', 'reasons', 'ending', 'was', 'great', 'as', 'well', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'music', 'was', 'also', 'amazing', 'matched', 'tone', 'film.Overall', 'Moment', 'Remember', 'effective', 'drama', 'thanks', 'deep', 'storyline', 'superb', 'performances', 'gem', 'many', 'South', 'Korea', '12/27/12', 'film', 'available', 'Netflix', 'Streaming', 'purchase', 'highly', 'recommended.A', 'Moment', 'Remember', 'blood', 'violence', 'sex', 'nudity']",A Moment to Remember
994299,AAW58LG72PG7I,B000FQJPA0,"Martin Asiner ""Adjunct College Instructor""","[0, 0]",A MOMENT TO REMEMBER is one of the most stunning films I have ever seen from any country. The story begins conventionally enough as a 27 year old Korean woman is heartbroken when her married lover dumps her by failing to meet her at a crowded train station. Her father takes her to a construction site where she sees a tall handsome carpenter and she falls heavily and instantly in love. Their passion is mutual and overwhelming. But the problem here is not only that her father opposes the match but by midfilm she learns that she has Alzheimer's and her memories of life and her husband will soon vanish. There is tearful and truly heartbreaking tragedy as everyone foresees the inevitable but no one can prevent it. The moments in which the husband and wife face her looming loss of memory are a tender battle to keep somehow even a spark of remembrance alive. The wife is there physically but soon enough no longer remembers her husband. There are two scenes of riveting power. The first occurs when just enough of her mind lingers to enable her to write a letter of love and memory to him. She calls this fleeting moment a celebration that must be treasured since it is only too short lived. The second takes place at the end when she dimly knows that her husband is somewhere locked into her body if not in her mind. Such a movie as this is a triumphant celebration of the human spirit that succeeds in moving us even if the dreaded illness takes yet another victim away from her loved ones.,5,Heaven is a Moment to remember,1402272000,"06 9, 2014",2014,1497,"['MOMENT', 'TO', 'REMEMBER', 'one', 'most', 'stunning', 'films', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'country', 'story', 'conventionally', 'enough', '27', 'year', 'old', 'Korean', 'woman', 'heartbroken', 'when', 'married', 'lover', 'failing', 'meet', 'crowded', 'train', 'station', 'father', 'construction', 'site', 'where', 'tall', 'handsome', 'carpenter', 'heavily', 'instantly', 'love', 'passion', 'mutual', 'overwhelming', 'problem', 'here', 'not', 'only', 'father', 'match', 'midfilm', 'Alzheimer', 'memories', 'life', 'husband', 'will', 'soon', 'vanish', 'tearful', 'truly', 'heartbreaking', 'tragedy', 'everyone', 'inevitable', 'one', 'can', 'prevent', 'moments', 'husband', 'wife', 'face', 'looming', 'loss', 'memory', 'are', 'tender', 'battle', 'keep', 'somehow', 'even', 'spark', 'remembrance', 'alive', 'wife', 'physically', 'soon', 'enough', 'no', 'longer', 'husband', 'are', 'two', 'scenes', 'riveting', 'power', 'first', 'when', 'just', 'enough', 'mind', 'lingers', 'enable', 'write', 'letter', 'love', 'memory', 'fleeting', 'moment', 'celebration', 'must', 'be', 'treasured', 'only', 'too', 'short', 'lived', 'second', 'place', 'end', 'when', 'dimly', 'knows', 'husband', 'somewhere', 'locked', 'body', 'not', 'mind', 'movie', 'triumphant', 'celebration', 'human', 'spirit', 'moving', 'even', 'dreaded', 'illness', 'yet', 'victim', 'away', 'loved', 'ones']",A Moment to Remember
