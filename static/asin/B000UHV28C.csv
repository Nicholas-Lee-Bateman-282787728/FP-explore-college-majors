I had to see the outcome. Kept me intrigued. The scenery is also special. I enjoyed the illustrations. I don't want to give any of the plot away, but I think we have all, at some time in our life, had a fantasy about meeting someone we idolized, but never thought it would happen. To see this played out and become an obsession, well that is all I will say. Watch it!",4,Incredible story line,1332374400,"03 22, 2012",2012,464,"['story', 'so', 'very', 'unique', 'cast', 'most', 'enjoyable', 'just', 'spent', 'whole', 'weekend', 'watching', 'had', 'see', 'outcome', 'intrigued', 'scenery', 'also', 'special', 'enjoyed', 'illustrations', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'plot', 'away', 'think', 'have', 'time', 'life', 'had', 'fantasy', 'meeting', 'someone', 'idolized', 'never', 'thought', 'would', 'happen', 'see', 'played', 'out', 'become', 'obsession', 'well', 'will', 'say', 'Watch']",N/A

It was a pretty good price for a Korean Drama. I was happy with the shipping.,5,Cas,1383523200,"11 4, 2013",2013,235,"['chose', 'rating', 'was', 'new', 'seller', 'said', 'would', 'be', 'was', 'YA', 'Entertainment', 'was', 'shown', 'Amazon', 'not', 'different', 'studio', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'price', 'Korean', 'Drama', 'was', 'happy', 'shipping']",N/A
1095003,ABQS74EP1NBM4,B000UHV28C,Sinton,"[6, 6]","I recommend Someday very highly .  It is unique  as there is no stereotyped plot, no evil mother-in-law type, no unkind ex-girlfriend, no music throughout the program which repeats itself.  The actors are excellent.  The idea of making the main character an anime artist leads to many interesting scenes and the story within a story is very well thought out.  I was never sure how the story would end, which was fascinating and nerve wracking, but there was 'growth' for the characters and this made the series really winning.  Really, really, well directed.  The costumes were very well done, and as usual in Korean television - excellent makeup!!",5,Someday,1339200000,"06 9, 2012",2012,648,"['recommend', 'Someday', 'very', 'highly', 'unique', 'stereotyped', 'plot', 'evil', 'mother-in-law', 'type', 'unkind', 'ex-girlfriend', 'music', 'program', 'actors', 'are', 'excellent', 'idea', 'making', 'main', 'character', 'anime', 'artist', 'many', 'interesting', 'scenes', 'story', 'story', 'very', 'well', 'thought', 'out', 'was', 'never', 'sure', 'how', 'story', 'would', 'end', 'was', 'fascinating', 'nerve', 'wracking', 'there', 'was', ""'growth"", 'characters', 'made', 'series', 'really', 'winning', 'Really', 'really', 'well', 'directed', 'costumes', 'were', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'as', 'usual', 'Korean', 'television', 'excellent', 'makeup']",N/A
1095004,A1EH9Z0L6DVPJI,B000UHV28C,William Butler,"[12, 12]","It took a while but I finally found a drama that was equal to Coffee Prince in Someday. I can't say enough good things about this one. First and foremost it went to great lengths to separate itself from ""typical"". While it still had a love triangle (or square, actually) it handled the overlapping relationships in a way that was believable and interesting. There were a few predictable sequences but for the most part they never detracted from the storytelling. It was also wonderful to watch parallel stories unfold as the primary characters develop and learn about the old woman and her life-long love, through her diary and the animated scenes.This was my first time watching Bae Doo-Na. Her portrayal of a disturbed and emotionally vacant young woman felt so real that it was painful and draining; which is as it should be. At the same time her near childlike innocence drew me in and made me care about her. All of the other actors handed in memorable performances as well but Doo Na's was some of the best I've ever had the pleasure of watching.As for the pacing... all I can say is that for a story of this type it was fine. It wasn't an action story or a romantic comedy. As long as you go in understanding this is a romance you shouldn't have a problem waiting for things to unfold and plots to develop. The only down side to the entire series was that the character Go Jin Pyo (Kim Min Joon) never developed to the point that he came to understand he was a jerk (I'd use stronger language but I'm being polite).Since I've only just ordered the DVD, I can't attest to the quality of the package or product playback. However, I highly recommend the series based on the weight of the story.",5,Five Out Of Five Stars,1318377600,"10 12, 2011",2011,1698,"['took', 'while', 'finally', 'found', 'drama', 'was', 'equal', 'Coffee', 'Prince', 'Someday', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'enough', 'good', 'things', 'one', 'First', 'foremost', 'went', 'great', 'lengths', 'separate', 'typical', 'still', 'had', 'love', 'triangle', 'square', 'actually', 'handled', 'overlapping', 'relationships', 'way', 'was', 'believable', 'interesting', 'were', 'few', 'predictable', 'sequences', 'most', 'part', 'never', 'detracted', 'storytelling', 'was', 'also', 'wonderful', 'watch', 'parallel', 'stories', 'unfold', 'primary', 'characters', 'develop', 'learn', 'old', 'woman', 'life-long', 'love', 'diary', 'animated', 'scenes.This', 'was', 'first', 'time', 'watching', 'Bae', 'Doo-Na', 'portrayal', 'disturbed', 'emotionally', 'vacant', 'young', 'woman', 'felt', 'so', 'real', 'was', 'painful', 'draining', 'should', 'be', 'same', 'time', 'childlike', 'innocence', 'drew', 'made', 'care', 'other', 'actors', 'handed', 'memorable', 'performances', 'as', 'well', 'Doo', 'Na', 'was', 'best', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'had', 'pleasure', 'watching.As', 'pacing', 'can', 'say', 'story', 'type', 'was', 'fine', 'was', ""n't"", 'action', 'story', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'As', 'long', 'go', 'understanding', 'romance', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'problem', 'waiting', 'things', 'unfold', 'plots', 'develop', 'only', 'down', 'side', 'entire', 'series', 'was', 'character', 'Go', 'Jin', 'Pyo', 'Kim', 'Min', 'Joon', 'never', 'developed', 'point', 'came', 'understand', 'was', 'jerk', ""'d"", 'use', 'stronger', 'language', ""'m"", 'being', 'polite', '.Since', ""'ve"", 'only', 'just', 'ordered', 'DVD', 'ca', ""n't"", 'attest', 'quality', 'package', 'product', 'playback', 'However', 'highly', 'recommend', 'series', 'based', 'weight', 'story']",N/A
