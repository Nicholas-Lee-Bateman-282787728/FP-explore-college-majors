990089,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000FGGN9Q,Grady Harp,"[14, 14]","SIMON is a little jewel of a film. In a manner more typically Dutch than most it is an exploration of the interaction of two men, opposites in almost every way except in their potential power of friendship.Camiel is a gay, tender, polite, dental student while Simon is straight, seemingly critical of gay aspects (though always with tongue in cheek), noisy, outspoken, crafty, boisterous and a bit crude caf&eacute;  owner. The two collide in an accident, an act that bonds them inextricably, and the film shows the two polar opposites reconnecting fourteen years later when Simon is dying of cancer and calls upon all his resources and involves Camiel in the difficult process of life's ending. Simon's strength of character (despite his previous outwardly bombastic and crude manner) gives Camiel much to learn - and gives the audience some touching and tender thoughts on which to dwell. The film is a fun, at times naughty, smart, and ultimately life-affirming tale about the importance of friendship and family...and a strong sense of humor...that are the stuff that allow us to survive even the most difficult of moments in life.The entire cast is excellent but the performances by Cees Geel as Simon and Marcel Hensema as Camiel Vrolijk are worthy of awards. This is an extravagantly fun film, completely open and honest about its sexuality, that results in a memorable emotional experience for the viewer. In Dutch with English subtitles.

990094,AQE41QO3NEUMW,B000FGGN9Q,"Ronald Scheer ""rockysquirrel""","[7, 7]","And now, as they used to say on Monty Python, for something completely different. This film is a kind of screwball comedy that portrays an odd-couple friendship between its title character, a crudely hilarious cafe owner and drug dealer (""soft drugs,"" we are informed) and women's boxing coach, and a mild-mannered gay dentist named Camiel. It is Simon who takes Camiel under his wing, after knocking him down with his car. In mid-winter, they spend vacation time on the beaches of Thailand, along with an entourage of Simon's friends, including two women who are fiercely attached to him. All very Dutch in its free-wheeling embrace of life lived to its absolute limits.Fourteen years later, the two men's paths cross again, and this time Simon, still capable of just about any kind of social outrage, has been diagnosed with inoperable cancer, and his old friend Camiel is drawn again into the circle of friends - plus two growing children -  who love and support him. While Simon's potential for outrage is pretty much undaunted by his declining health, it's clear that some arrangements need to be made for his approaching demise, and there the film begins a fascinating dance on the margin between farce and the maudlin. Finally, after a gay wedding (how often do you see that in the movies?), what begins as an accidental meeting is played out with a touching inevitability. Absolutely recommended for anyone with a yen for a life-affirming film that is unlike anything you've ever seen.",5,Accidents happen . . .,1204761600,"03 6, 2008",2008,1493,"['now', 'used', 'say', 'Monty', 'Python', 'something', 'completely', 'different', 'film', 'kind', 'screwball', 'comedy', 'odd-couple', 'friendship', 'title', 'character', 'crudely', 'hilarious', 'cafe', 'owner', 'drug', 'dealer', 'soft', 'drugs', 'are', 'informed', 'women', 'boxing', 'coach', 'mild-mannered', 'gay', 'dentist', 'named', 'Camiel', 'Simon', 'who', 'Camiel', 'wing', 'knocking', 'down', 'car', 'mid-winter', 'spend', 'vacation', 'time', 'beaches', 'Thailand', 'entourage', 'Simon', 'friends', 'including', 'two', 'women', 'who', 'are', 'fiercely', 'attached', 'very', 'Dutch', 'free-wheeling', 'embrace', 'life', 'lived', 'absolute', 'limits.Fourteen', 'years', 'later', 'two', 'men', 'paths', 'cross', 'again', 'time', 'Simon', 'still', 'capable', 'just', 'kind', 'social', 'outrage', 'been', 'diagnosed', 'inoperable', 'cancer', 'old', 'friend', 'Camiel', 'drawn', 'again', 'circle', 'friends', 'two', 'growing', 'children', 'who', 'love', 'support', 'Simon', 'potential', 'outrage', 'pretty', 'much', 'undaunted', 'declining', 'health', 'clear', 'arrangements', 'need', 'be', 'made', 'approaching', 'demise', 'there', 'film', 'fascinating', 'dance', 'margin', 'farce', 'maudlin', 'Finally', 'gay', 'wedding', 'how', 'often', 'do', 'see', 'movies', 'what', 'accidental', 'meeting', 'played', 'out', 'touching', 'inevitability', 'Absolutely', 'recommended', 'anyone', 'yen', 'life-affirming', 'film', 'anything', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen']",Simon
