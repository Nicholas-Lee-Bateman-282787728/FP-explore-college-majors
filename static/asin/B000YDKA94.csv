1118612,AR3BZOTB7IY78,B000YDKA94,Anton Karidian,"[2, 3]","As you've probably gathered from other reviews, this film concerns a high school gym teacher, Mr. Woodcock, who berates and abuses his students. When Mr. Woodcock first hurled a basketball at a student and whacked him in the stomach, I chuckled in a startled way. But when such abuse went on and on and got more violent, it ceased to be at all funny. When the movie flashed forward 13 years to one of those abused students finding out his mother is going to marry this moron, I anticipated some interesting character interactions that hopefully would put this guy in his place. However, the film went nowhere, and most of the humor is based on ultra-foul language and sophomoric gags that made me think I was watching another awful teen movie. The formula quickly wore thin, and I felt sorry for the actors who must have regretted getting themselves into this mess, especially Susan Sarandon, who is one of my favorites. I know it's not good to give away the ending of films, so I'll just say that despite the low expectations that the film generates, I was still agog that the ending actually CONDONES the coach's bad behavior!! My only consolation is that I checked this DVD out free from a library so I didn't waste any money on it!",1,"Film goes nowhere, and is sadistic",1206316800,"03 24, 2008",2008,1235,"[""'ve"", 'probably', 'gathered', 'other', 'reviews', 'film', 'high', 'school', 'gym', 'teacher', 'Mr.', 'Woodcock', 'who', 'students', 'When', 'Mr.', 'Woodcock', 'first', 'hurled', 'basketball', 'student', 'whacked', 'stomach', 'chuckled', 'startled', 'way', 'when', 'such', 'abuse', 'went', 'got', 'more', 'violent', 'ceased', 'be', 'funny', 'When', 'movie', 'flashed', 'forward', '13', 'years', 'one', 'abused', 'students', 'finding', 'out', 'mother', 'going', 'marry', 'moron', 'anticipated', 'interesting', 'character', 'interactions', 'hopefully', 'would', 'put', 'guy', 'place', 'However', 'film', 'went', 'nowhere', 'most', 'humor', 'based', 'ultra-foul', 'language', 'sophomoric', 'gags', 'made', 'think', 'was', 'watching', 'awful', 'teen', 'movie', 'formula', 'quickly', 'wore', 'thin', 'felt', 'sorry', 'actors', 'who', 'must', 'have', 'regretted', 'getting', 'mess', 'especially', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'who', 'one', 'favorites', 'know', 'not', 'good', 'give', 'away', 'ending', 'films', ""'ll"", 'just', 'say', 'low', 'expectations', 'film', 'generates', 'was', 'still', 'ending', 'actually', 'CONDONES', 'coach', 'bad', 'behavior', 'only', 'consolation', 'checked', 'DVD', 'out', 'free', 'library', 'so', 'did', ""n't"", 'waste', 'money']",N/A

I was actually laughing quite hard at certain parts, such as the entire town thinking Billy Bob was some kind of perfect man, but the son of the mother Billy Bob was dating totally disagreed.  This led to a funny segment afterwards.In fact, the storyline for the most part was about Billy Bob dating a mother, and the son of the mother constantly getting into fights with Billy Bob's character.  This was because Billy Bob's character was a gym teacher that had the son as a student many years before, and as a gym teacher, he used to torment the heck out of the kids.Another memorable part was when the son decided he finally had enough of being treated like garbage by Billy's character, and challenged him to a wrestling match.  In the end, the best part of the movie was obviously the little amount of harsh treatment from Billy Bob we got to see.Billy Bob Thorton wasn't quite as ignorant/funny in this film as he was in that Santa Claus movie he did a few years back, but he was still pretty good here.  And this movie is nothing like that rocket building movie he did, which was a serious film.

1118623,A1E9QU27DMFRGS,B000YDKA94,Danielle Turchiano,"[0, 0]","In a series of so-called comedic one-uppence, self-help author John Farley (Seann William Scott) challenges his former gym teacher Mr. Woodcock (Billy Bob Thornton) to a workout contest, determined to beat the man who so often in his past beat him down.  In fact, Farley was so scarred by Woodcock that he shaped his whole professional philosophy as one of passiveness and positivity, the complete opposite of Woodcock's own teaching philosophy, which relied on insults and chucking dodgeballs at them.  Farley's return to his hometown to celebrate his literary success should be one that matches the positive messages he enforces in his writing, but tormented by the memories of Woodcock's verbal and physical humiliation, such as extreme lap-running and being forced to strip and do pull-ups in front of his classmates, his experience quickly sours when he learns his mother (Susan Sarandon) is now engaged to the sadist.  In his feature film directorial debut, Craig Gillespie is forced to rely on schmaltzy physical comedy for laughs because equally green first-timers' Michael Carnes and Josh Gilbert's script is just too thin to provide humor on its own.There isn't much to say about the plot of Mr. Woodcock because there isn't much of a plot to begin with.  Gillespie puts his actors in insane situations, such as grown men slick with butter and spewing little yellow nuggets during a corn-eating contest or the five-time Oscar nominee Susan Sarandon in a Wizard of Oz Glinda prom dress, boasting a sash that says ""Corn Cob Queen.""  Thornton's innate cynicism drives every dig at Farley home with intense realism, but coupled with Sarandon's doe-eyed portrayal of a dimwit mother and Scott's soft-spoken submissive son, he seems out of place, and they all just come off as caricatures.Amy Poehler as Farley's sardonic agent and Ethan Suplee as his moronic friend Nederman try their best to elicit a few chuckles, but the majority of the ""humorous"" situations are just cringe-worthy.  Mr. Woodcock does allow the audience to understand the torture John Farley felt at the hands of his former teacher and should-have-been mentor because the process of viewing the film is actually quite painful in and of itself and would have been a nice device for Woodcock to use on his students.If one manages to make it through the full feature of Mr. Woodcock, it would be quite surprising if he or she actually wanted to see more, but the DVD does offer a few Special Features, including nine deleted scenes and one extended sequence.  If these were scenes that weren't good enough to make the final cut, and the end result isn't very funny anyway, then needless to say, these scenes should have remained on the cutting room floor; there is no need for anyone to view them.  Ever.There is also a fifteen-minute ""Making Of"" documentary, which includes commentary from the cast and Gillespie, but they seem to ramble on about nothing and laugh at their own inside jokes rather than say anything worth listening to.  The ten-minute ""Trauma Tales"" featurette, in which the filmmakers offer painful childhood stories of their own gym class experiences, is perhaps the best thing on this disc... but that isn't saying a lot.  Of course, there are trailers for upcoming New Line films, as well, which is basically just a way for the studio to beg you not to completely write them off with a promise that they have some better projects hitting theaters within the next few months (Be Kind Rewind, Harold & Kumar: Escape From Guantanamo Bay, and Vince Vaughn's Wild West Comedy Show).",2,Do You Really Want To Revisit Why You Hated High School?,1210982400,"05 17, 2008",2008,3571,"['series', 'so-called', 'comedic', 'one-uppence', 'self-help', 'author', 'John', 'Farley', 'Seann', 'William', 'Scott', 'former', 'gym', 'teacher', 'Mr.', 'Woodcock', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'workout', 'contest', 'determined', 'beat', 'man', 'who', 'so', 'often', 'past', 'beat', 'down', 'fact', 'Farley', 'was', 'so', 'scarred', 'Woodcock', 'shaped', 'whole', 'professional', 'philosophy', 'one', 'passiveness', 'positivity', 'complete', 'opposite', 'Woodcock', 'own', 'teaching', 'philosophy', 'relied', 'insults', 'chucking', 'dodgeballs', 'Farley', 'return', 'hometown', 'celebrate', 'literary', 'success', 'should', 'be', 'one', 'positive', 'messages', 'writing', 'tormented', 'memories', 'Woodcock', 'verbal', 'physical', 'humiliation', 'such', 'extreme', 'lap-running', 'being', 'forced', 'strip', 'do', 'pull-ups', 'front', 'classmates', 'experience', 'quickly', 'sours', 'when', 'mother', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'now', 'engaged', 'sadist', 'feature', 'film', 'directorial', 'debut', 'Craig', 'Gillespie', 'forced', 'rely', 'schmaltzy', 'physical', 'comedy', 'laughs', 'equally', 'green', 'first-timers', 'Michael', 'Carnes', 'Josh', 'Gilbert', 'script', 'just', 'too', 'thin', 'provide', 'humor', 'own.There', ""n't"", 'much', 'say', 'plot', 'Mr.', 'Woodcock', ""n't"", 'much', 'plot', 'begin', 'Gillespie', 'actors', 'insane', 'situations', 'such', 'grown', 'men', 'slick', 'butter', 'spewing', 'little', 'yellow', 'nuggets', 'corn-eating', 'contest', 'five-time', 'Oscar', 'nominee', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'Wizard', 'Oz', 'Glinda', 'prom', 'dress', 'boasting', 'sash', 'Corn', 'Cob', 'Queen', 'Thornton', 'innate', 'cynicism', 'drives', 'dig', 'Farley', 'home', 'intense', 'realism', 'coupled', 'Sarandon', 'doe-eyed', 'portrayal', 'dimwit', 'mother', 'Scott', 'soft-spoken', 'submissive', 'son', 'place', 'just', 'come', 'off', 'caricatures.Amy', 'Poehler', 'Farley', 'sardonic', 'agent', 'Ethan', 'Suplee', 'moronic', 'friend', 'Nederman', 'try', 'best', 'elicit', 'few', 'chuckles', 'majority', 'humorous', 'situations', 'are', 'just', 'cringe-worthy', 'Mr.', 'Woodcock', 'allow', 'audience', 'understand', 'torture', 'John', 'Farley', 'felt', 'hands', 'former', 'teacher', 'should-have-been', 'mentor', 'process', 'viewing', 'film', 'actually', 'quite', 'painful', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'device', 'Woodcock', 'use', 'students.If', 'one', 'make', 'full', 'feature', 'Mr.', 'Woodcock', 'would', 'be', 'quite', 'surprising', 'actually', 'wanted', 'see', 'more', 'DVD', 'offer', 'few', 'Special', 'Features', 'including', 'nine', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'one', 'extended', 'sequence', 'were', 'scenes', 'were', ""n't"", 'good', 'enough', 'make', 'final', 'cut', 'end', 'result', ""n't"", 'very', 'funny', 'anyway', 'then', 'needless', 'say', 'scenes', 'should', 'have', 'remained', 'cutting', 'room', 'floor', 'need', 'anyone', 'view', 'Ever.There', 'also', 'fifteen-minute', 'Making', 'documentary', 'commentary', 'cast', 'Gillespie', 'seem', 'ramble', 'nothing', 'laugh', 'own', 'inside', 'jokes', 'rather', 'say', 'anything', 'worth', 'listening', 'ten-minute', 'Trauma', 'Tales', 'featurette', 'filmmakers', 'offer', 'painful', 'childhood', 'stories', 'own', 'gym', 'class', 'experiences', 'perhaps', 'best', 'thing', 'disc', ""n't"", 'saying', 'lot', 'course', 'are', 'trailers', 'upcoming', 'New', 'Line', 'films', 'as', 'well', 'basically', 'just', 'way', 'studio', 'beg', 'not', 'completely', 'write', 'off', 'promise', 'have', 'better', 'projects', 'hitting', 'theaters', 'next', 'few', 'months', 'Be', 'Kind', 'Rewind', 'Harold', 'Kumar', 'Escape', 'Guantanamo', 'Bay', 'Vince', 'Vaughn', 'Wild', 'West', 'Comedy', 'Show']",N/A

I only would take issue with his low rating of it. I found the film amusing and well conceived, the acting excellent. Anyway, I am one of those fans who can find almost no wrong at all with whatever Billy Bob Thornton (as the stern gym coach) does for the siver screen. He, in the title role, and the entire cast make this tale of junior high physical education lived and relived very lively. Probably, in real life, the only teachers, as a group, who are as dreadful as gym teachers are math teachers; that applies, dismally, at the college and university level, as well. Teachers of both subject areas rated really, really low in my memories (and in those of a lot of other folks whom I know) of junior high school. (I was luckier in senior high school, where the math teachers were equally abysmal but where the gym teachers were quite decent men and instructors, but the experience of mathematics and physical education hit new lows, if anything, in my university years!)Having lived too sheltered and pampered a life to have experienced anything so soul-trying and ruggedly harsh as military ""boot camp"" and the drill sargents or petty officers who train the troops thereat, John Farley (as Sean William Scott so comically plays the role) conceives, instead, of his past gym teacher as a cruel tyrant who has been the Great Personal Nemesis in his life and nightmares, which makes John`s horror on discovering that his widowed mother`s affection for Mr. Woodcock, as her exceedingly virile lover, will end in Woodcock becoming John`s step-father, a prospect that appalls the son.Anyway, Mr. Woodcock gets back, from John Farley, some of what he deserves for what he had done to, ahem! so many athletically challenged pupils, such as John himself, in Woodcock`s highly disciplined phys. ed. classes. John, a successful writer of sappy motivational self-help books, whose mother (acted by Susan Sarandon) is romantically involved with Woodcock, has a capital opportunity to grow up (at last!), the hard way. The film really is worth a video rental, at least, really and truly!

1118635,A2Y3CWITEF9JGY,B000YDKA94,"JP Salazar ""Web Developer""","[11, 12]","I still remember the meanest teacher I've ever had back in High School. That short guy always punished the students for little or no reason at all and unfortunately we just had to deal with it (doing pushups with your knuckles is not fun at all). I'm sure that most of us can relate to these unpleasant--and sometimes even painful--memories from childhood. Mr. Woodcock is a movie about that teacher that you loved to hate. Not only made poor John miserable as a boy, but he is coming back to date his mom. This is without a doubt, one of the funniest films of the year (unfortunately not many critics believe this statement). It follows the Meet the Parents formula with situational jokes and great performances by Billy Bob Thornton and Seann William Scott who together are dynamite and perfectly suitable for their roles.Brief Intro Story:John Farley (Seann William Scott) is a junior high kid who is constantly suffering humiliation by his gym teacher Mr. Woodcock (Billy Bob Thornton). Little John is not the only victim here, but all of the kids from his class suffer by the same demeaning punishment.Thirteen years has passed and now Farley is a successful writer who has a best selling book called ""Letting Go, How to get past your past""--inspired by his childhood memories. As he is traveling around the country promoting his book with his agent Maggie Hoffman (Amy Poehler), he finds out that he just got an award from his hometown. It will be a great opportunity to say hello to his dear mother Beverly (Susan Sarandon) who lives alone--unfortunately John lost his father years ago.As he gets home to say hello to his mom, he finds found that she is dating no other than his number one nemesis Mr. Woodcock. There is bad blood almost instantly between them and John will do anything to separate them.Review:Mr. Woodcock entertains mostly because of the hostility and obsession--and many assumptions--that John has towards his old gym teacher. He remembers him with anger and in a way--even though he is a young adult now--he still sees him through the eyes of a bitter child. He cannot stand the fact that he is dating his mom and he is willing to give up his career as a writer in order to stop this relationship. John also notices that his adversary is a great figure in his community. Why is that so? But he makes a mistake by not understanding Woodcock's persona with more depth. Why is he like that with the students? Is he doing it to discipline his students so they can become better people? He is surprised that no one can see his dark side but him--his mom is totally in love with the guy. Mr. Woodcock is full of surprises and John is going to find out the hard way.Besides the situational jokes (the Tyra Banks Show and the last reunion scene are my favorites), animosity between teacher and student and great chemistry between both foes, the film works because director Craig Gillespie injects a bit of drama and mutual understanding, especially towards the end of the film. I guarantee the ending will please the audience.The Verdict:despised by many critics but praised but few (I'm one of those few). Mr. Woodcock is an entertaining film that deals with those evil teachers we remember from our childhood days, but we never get to know them that well. In a way Mr. Woodcock ""helped"" John to become a successful writer.

Bernabo,"[9, 12]","The other day I watched ""Good Luck Chuck"" and gave it two stars, but now that I have seen ""Mr. Woodcock"" I feel like I should go back and give the other movie three stars so it will not be on the same rating plateau as this absymal film.  I know, I know: I could accomplish the same goal by giving ""Mr. Woodcock"" one star, but I reserve one star ratings for films where I think the people who made it should be hunted down and done physical violence (and, yes, I have found a couple of those), and with this film I just want to ask the cast what the hell were they thinking when they agreed to make this 2006 ""comedy.""  The one thing I can say in defense of this film is that if you are getting sick and tired of the raunchy comedies that having been dominating the cinematic landscape from ""There's Something About Mary"" to ""Superbad"" (you can usually tell them because they are inevitably released as ""Unrated"" editions on DVD), then rest assured that ""Mr. Woodcock"" fails to fall into that company.The premise seems workable enough.  John Farley (Seann William Scott) returns in triumph as a successful self-help author to his hometown in Nebraska only to discover that Jasper Woodcock (Billy Bob Thornton), the gymn teacher who tormented him unmercifully in school, is now dating his mom, Beverly (Susan Sarandon).  To be clear, Beverly is John's mother and not Jasper's mother, although that twisted situation might have been an improvement.  John and his old school chum Nedderman (Ethan Suplee) and everybody working at the local fast food restaurant know that Woodcock is a wretched human being, so Beverly has to be saved from a fate worse than death.  The other main supporting players are Maggie Hoffman (Amy Poehler), John's pushy agent, and Tracy (Melissa Sagemiller), another one of John's former classmates who serves as a romantic prospect.  She never really becomes more than that because this film is all about John trying to breakup his mother and Woodcock.The best parts of the movie take place in gym class, where Mr. Woodcock throws basketballs at this students, demands pushups and laps for any and all infractions, and tries to drive home exactly what a ""rhetorical question"" happens to be.  As far as sadistic gym teachers go, Mr. Woodcock is pretty much presented as just doing his job.  If anything, he is so indifferent to the physical and mental punishments that he is dishing out that you really have to downgrade him from sadist to overgrown bully.  There is a perverse pleasure to be gained in watching Woodcock abusing his students because you sit there and think that this guy is going to get his comeuppance.  I am probably on the verge of a spoiler here, except that I can make the argument you cannot spoil something that is already rotten.Director Craig Gillespie's film falls apart in the final act, where things come to a head and we are force fed what passes for a happy ending.  There is a point where things turn ""serious,"" and I just had to role my eyes because it was way too late to pretend that logical rules were supposed to be applied to these relationships.  Thornton and Sarandon are way too good for this, and Scott is apparently trying to convince us that this is all he is good for as an actor (after ""The Rundown: and ""Bulletproof Monk"" I would have predicted a better future than this for Scott).  In the end, the movie this reminds me most of ended up being ""Anger Management,"" which should make sense in retrospect.  To be fair, this movie does have a totally appropriate punch line, which is delivered not once but twice as the last word in the film and in its end credits.",2,The funniest movie of the 21st century . . . just kidding,1200700800,"01 19, 2008",2008,3632,"['other', 'day', 'watched', 'Good', 'Luck', 'Chuck', 'gave', 'two', 'stars', 'now', 'have', 'seen', 'Mr.', 'Woodcock', 'feel', 'should', 'go', 'back', 'give', 'other', 'movie', 'three', 'stars', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'same', 'rating', 'plateau', 'absymal', 'film', 'know', 'know', 'could', 'accomplish', 'same', 'goal', 'giving', 'Mr.', 'Woodcock', 'one', 'star', 'reserve', 'one', 'star', 'ratings', 'films', 'where', 'think', 'people', 'who', 'made', 'should', 'be', 'hunted', 'down', 'done', 'physical', 'violence', 'yes', 'have', 'found', 'couple', 'film', 'just', 'want', 'ask', 'cast', 'what', 'hell', 'were', 'thinking', 'when', 'agreed', 'make', '2006', 'comedy', 'one', 'thing', 'can', 'say', 'defense', 'film', 'are', 'getting', 'sick', 'tired', 'raunchy', 'having', 'been', 'dominating', 'cinematic', 'landscape', 'Something', 'Mary', 'Superbad', 'can', 'usually', 'tell', 'are', 'inevitably', 'released', 'Unrated', 'editions', 'DVD', 'then', 'rest', 'assured', 'Mr.', 'Woodcock', 'fall', 'company.The', 'premise', 'workable', 'enough', 'John', 'Farley', 'Seann', 'William', 'Scott', 'triumph', 'successful', 'self-help', 'author', 'hometown', 'Nebraska', 'only', 'discover', 'Jasper', 'Woodcock', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'gymn', 'teacher', 'who', 'tormented', 'unmercifully', 'school', 'now', 'dating', 'mom', 'Beverly', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'be', 'clear', 'Beverly', 'John', 'mother', 'not', 'Jasper', 'mother', 'twisted', 'situation', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'improvement', 'John', 'old', 'school', 'chum', 'Nedderman', 'Ethan', 'Suplee', 'everybody', 'working', 'local', 'fast', 'food', 'restaurant', 'know', 'Woodcock', 'wretched', 'human', 'being', 'so', 'Beverly', 'be', 'saved', 'fate', 'worse', 'death', 'other', 'main', 'supporting', 'players', 'are', 'Maggie', 'Hoffman', 'Amy', 'Poehler', 'John', 'pushy', 'agent', 'Tracy', 'Melissa', 'Sagemiller', 'one', 'John', 'former', 'classmates', 'who', 'romantic', 'prospect', 'never', 'really', 'more', 'film', 'John', 'trying', 'breakup', 'mother', 'Woodcock.The', 'best', 'parts', 'movie', 'take', 'place', 'gym', 'class', 'where', 'Mr.', 'Woodcock', 'basketballs', 'students', 'pushups', 'laps', 'infractions', 'tries', 'drive', 'home', 'exactly', 'what', 'rhetorical', 'question', 'be', 'As', 'far', 'sadistic', 'gym', 'teachers', 'go', 'Mr.', 'Woodcock', 'pretty', 'much', 'presented', 'just', 'doing', 'job', 'anything', 'so', 'indifferent', 'physical', 'mental', 'punishments', 'dishing', 'out', 'really', 'have', 'downgrade', 'sadist', 'overgrown', 'bully', 'perverse', 'pleasure', 'be', 'gained', 'watching', 'Woodcock', 'abusing', 'students', 'sit', 'think', 'guy', 'going', 'get', 'comeuppance', 'am', 'probably', 'verge', 'spoiler', 'here', 'can', 'make', 'argument', 'can', 'not', 'spoil', 'something', 'already', 'rotten.Director', 'Craig', 'Gillespie', 'film', 'apart', 'final', 'act', 'where', 'things', 'come', 'head', 'are', 'force', 'fed', 'what', 'happy', 'ending', 'point', 'where', 'things', 'turn', 'serious', 'just', 'had', 'role', 'eyes', 'was', 'way', 'too', 'late', 'pretend', 'logical', 'rules', 'were', 'supposed', 'be', 'applied', 'relationships', 'Thornton', 'Sarandon', 'are', 'way', 'too', 'good', 'Scott', 'apparently', 'trying', 'convince', 'good', 'actor', 'Rundown', 'Bulletproof', 'Monk', 'would', 'have', 'predicted', 'better', 'future', 'Scott', 'end', 'movie', 'most', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'Anger', 'Management', 'should', 'make', 'sense', 'retrospect', 'be', 'fair', 'movie', 'have', 'totally', 'appropriate', 'punch', 'line', 'delivered', 'not', 'once', 'twice', 'last', 'word', 'film', 'end', 'credits']",N/A

1118642,AGCJDJH2CTDD9,B000YDKA94,Mike Zimmerman,"[14, 19]","After surviving the wrath of his take-no-prisoners gym teacher Jasper Woodcock (Billy Bob Thornton), John Farley (Seann William Scott) has grown from a fat nerd to a successful self-help book author. On his way home to accept a citizenship award at this year's Cornival, he finds out his mother Beverly (Susan Sarandon) is dating Woodcock for quite a while. With his forgotten past now back, he make whatever attempts he can to prove to his mother that Woodcock is no good for him.You know, some less-than-successful comedies have at least some charm to make them at least get some worthy laughs. ""Hot Rod"", as silly as it was, benefited from Andy Samberg's determined performance that gave him a movie career once he breaks free from ""Saturday Night Live""'s grasp. But when it comes to a film like ""Mr. Woodcock"", sometimes there isn't much hope. Adding insult to injury was the fact that it spent quite a while in hiding before being unleashed to unsuspecting moviegoers.First off, there is a solid cast backed here: Billy Bob Thornton, Seann William Scott, Ethan Suplee, Amy Poehler, and Susan Sarandon. Honestly, a cast like this can bring any material to life. However, a cast like this needs a stable filmmaker to help guide them, and Craig Gillespie (""Lars and the Real Girl"") is not the filmmaker for the job.I must disgress that leads Thornton and Scott are very funny men, but unless the film is rated R or even funny, they can bomb right at the start. That's probably why Thornton's biting one-liners and drill sergeant delivery, which worked so well in ""Bad Santa"" and ""Bad News Bears"", feel like leftovers. Scott's an even bigger curiosity; is he trying to mimic his ""Dude, Where's My Car"" co-star Ashton Kutcher's move from a comic powerhouse to a nice guy in movies? Only co-stars Suplee and Poehler come off unscathed and deliver the film's source of laughs that the film so desperately desires.The rest of the film is flat and been-there-done-that: crotch whallops, pratfalls involving senior citizens (not even Adam Sandler would dare use this as comedy), sexual innuendo (the banging-your-mom line is used ad nauseum), a love interest (Melissa Sagemiller) that doesn't fit in with the film, and even sentimentality. The latter one is a crushing blow. It's not as mind-numbingly grim as Adam Sandler's ""Click"", but once Farley tries to unmask Woodcock's supposed evildoings, Gillespie tries to paint sympathy that is hardly warranted in the first place.It's a shame that Mr. Woodcock is such a lame film, because whenever Gillespie films scenes with Suplee or Poehler, it's where he's in a comfort zone, allowing these two fine comic actors ease pain that would've came had they not been in the film. Regardless, it's still not a funny film, and disappointing work from Scott, Thornton, and Sarandon.

Here he wasn't as scummy as he could have been, because he is, after all, a teacher.  He is a tough teacher, the relentless and perhaps the most humiliating of experiences - gym class.  Everyone no matter how much of a weakling or muscle stud you may have been then or now, gym class was truly tramatic.  Putting on those ugly outfits, not being able to do chin ups, being in front of the whole class to see you preform, etc.  And the gym teacher is there to direct you in all your failures and tell you what a weakling you are.  *shudder*What could have been a great movie showcasing Billy Bob as a somewhat lovable scumbag flip flops into a sort of odd family comedy.  Seann William Scott, famous from the American Pie movies as the equally lovable scumbag, Stiffler, has returned to his Nebraska home town to accept a corn cob award for his work as an inspirational writer.  He has overcome all his hang ups and become a better person because of the power of positive thought.  When he comes home to visit his mom, Susan Sarandon, he finds that his mom is not just dating but plans to marry Mr. Woodcock.

1118649,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B000YDKA94,Roland E. Zwick,"[4, 5]","**1/2""Mr. Woodcock"" is one of those movies that sounds great on paper, but which loses something on its way to the big screen.Jasper Woodcock is a sadistic high school PE teacher who, through the course of his career, has made life a veritable hell for most of the boys enrolled in his class.  One of his students, an overweight kid by the name of John Farley, grows up to write a best-selling self-help book about letting go of one's past as a means of embracing one's future.  When John returns to his small town Nebraska home for a visit, he's mortified to discover that this very same Mr. Woodcock has become his widowed mother's new boyfriend.  Farley spends the rest of the movie doing everything he can think of to sabotage the romance, systematically violating all the precepts in the book that has made him so famous.With few exceptions, ""Mr. Woodcock"" fails to exploit the black comedy potential of its material, settling for homogenized, crowd-pleasing pablum instead.  That's not to say that there aren't some occasionally amusing moments in the film, only that they are too few and far between to turn the film into anything more than, at best, an average Hollywood comedy.  Billy Bob Thornton, Susan Sarandon and Seann William Scott (Stifler in the ""American Pie"" movies) have all proven their talent and likeability many times in the past, but they aren't allowed to go much beyond one-note performances in this film.

1118653,A2MYUI8IT6UBUU,B000YDKA94,"thejoelmeister ""www.GoneWithTheTwins.com""","[2, 2]","Everyone has probably met a ""Mr. Woodcock"" in their lives, and it will definitely affect the way you interpret or appreciate this film. Undoubtedly funny in its unyielding approach to raunchy slapstick humor, Mr. Woodcock keeps a consistently lighthearted tone even through to the unlikely conclusion, which helps prevent swaying mindsets and perspectives about these comical characters. Sacrificing meaningfulness for snappy, highly quotable one-liners, the winning combination of uncompassionate Billy Bob Thornton and sprightly Sean William Scott is plenty fulfilling.John Farley (Seann William Scott) has become a fairly well-known author for his acclaimed self-help book and decides to visit his mother, Beverly (Susan Surandon), in his hometown when he learns they wish to present him with a highly prestigious award. Once there he is shocked to discover that his hellishly strict and abusively domineering old gym teacher, Mr. Woodcock (Billy Bob Thornton) has been seeing his mother and they are engaged to be married. Desperate to break up this nightmarish union, John throws his own proverbs of ""leaving your past behind"" out the window and begins a maniacal campaign to dissuade his mother's interest in Woodcock.Several recent comedies fall into a plot trap in which the major conflict is so catastrophic that a feasible escape is too unbelievable, and therefore the conclusion is beyond the boundaries of realistic comedy. While Mr. Woodcock's premise is far from fantastical, it does successfully conclude the film satisfactorily without stretching beyond the limits of what is imagined in a sarcastic slapstick film. Nearly everything in the film is done to evoke laughs, so the steady, unfaltering tone lacking seriousness that remains even until the conclusion, is welcome indeed.""I didn't ask a question - not even a rhetorical one."" The abuse poor young Farley endures is sadly some of the most hilarious aspects of the film, and the repeated juxtaposition of flashbacks to his childhood P.E. mistreatment greatly enhances the humorous themes of revenge, and then apology that Farley deals with. All of his attempts at catching Mr. Woodcock making irreparable mistakes end in embarrassment for him and his fragile mother, and build up to the phenomenally hysterical showdown on the wrestling mat in the gym. Even when he wins little contests and competitions against Woodcock, such as the corn cob eating contest, he loses the girl (love interest Melissa Sagemiller) due to his obnoxious victory dance.Perhaps the most unique aspect of Woodcock is the lack of dream sequences from scenes you'd expect to be imagined. So often the main characters only daydream of getting revenge and openly speaking out against the antagonist. But in Mr. Woodcock, Farley actually does do all of the applause-inducing retribution that would be out-of-line for anyone other than Sean William Scott.The comedy performances in Mr. Woodcock are really what clinch its distinctiveness from other run-of-the-mill comedies. The chemistry between Scott and Billy Bob Thornton is amazing and their opposite personalities clash onscreen in perfect comedy contrast. Great one-liners from everyone help keep the laughs constant, and supporting cast member Amy Poehler takes the cake for cranky absurd spurts of angry dialogue. It is great to see a film that has more funny bits than what was revealed in the trailer.Such a comedic premise opens up all sorts of possibilities, but Mr. Woodcock stays as simplistically straightforward as possible. This lack of any twists and turns in plot may be a bigger shock than any dreamt up, and at several points throughout the film you might expect Farley to suddenly wake up and realize he didn't just say or do the things he actually did. The spontaneity of each character's actions, and their generally desired behavior, makes Woodcock extremely enjoyable at the time, and though only a few scenes stand out as side-splittingly hilarious (you'll know the ones), the unintentional realism and satisfying candidness might make it linger for some time after.- The Massie Twins",3,Mr. Woodcock Movie Review,1200268800,"01 14, 2008",2008,4106,"['Everyone', 'probably', 'met', 'Mr.', 'Woodcock', 'lives', 'will', 'definitely', 'affect', 'way', 'interpret', 'appreciate', 'film', 'Undoubtedly', 'funny', 'unyielding', 'approach', 'raunchy', 'slapstick', 'humor', 'Mr.', 'Woodcock', 'consistently', 'lighthearted', 'tone', 'even', 'unlikely', 'conclusion', 'prevent', 'swaying', 'mindsets', 'perspectives', 'comical', 'characters', 'Sacrificing', 'meaningfulness', 'snappy', 'highly', 'quotable', 'one-liners', 'winning', 'combination', 'uncompassionate', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'sprightly', 'Sean', 'William', 'Scott', 'plenty', 'fulfilling.John', 'Farley', 'Seann', 'William', 'Scott', 'become', 'fairly', 'well-known', 'author', 'acclaimed', 'self-help', 'book', 'decides', 'visit', 'mother', 'Beverly', 'Susan', 'Surandon', 'hometown', 'when', 'wish', 'present', 'highly', 'prestigious', 'award', 'Once', 'shocked', 'discover', 'hellishly', 'strict', 'abusively', 'domineering', 'old', 'gym', 'teacher', 'Mr.', 'Woodcock', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'been', 'seeing', 'mother', 'are', 'engaged', 'be', 'married', 'Desperate', 'break', 'up', 'nightmarish', 'union', 'John', 'own', 'proverbs', 'leaving', 'past', 'window', 'maniacal', 'campaign', 'dissuade', 'mother', 'interest', 'Woodcock.Several', 'recent', 'comedies', 'fall', 'plot', 'trap', 'major', 'conflict', 'so', 'catastrophic', 'feasible', 'escape', 'too', 'unbelievable', 'therefore', 'conclusion', 'boundaries', 'realistic', 'comedy', 'Mr.', 'Woodcock', 'premise', 'far', 'fantastical', 'successfully', 'conclude', 'film', 'satisfactorily', 'stretching', 'limits', 'what', 'imagined', 'sarcastic', 'slapstick', 'film', 'Nearly', 'everything', 'film', 'done', 'evoke', 'laughs', 'steady', 'unfaltering', 'tone', 'lacking', 'seriousness', 'even', 'conclusion', 'welcome', 'indeed', 'did', ""n't"", 'ask', 'question', 'not', 'even', 'rhetorical', 'one', 'abuse', 'poor', 'young', 'Farley', 'endures', 'sadly', 'most', 'hilarious', 'aspects', 'film', 'repeated', 'juxtaposition', 'flashbacks', 'childhood', 'P.E', 'mistreatment', 'greatly', 'humorous', 'themes', 'revenge', 'then', 'apology', 'Farley', 'deals', 'attempts', 'catching', 'Mr.', 'Woodcock', 'making', 'irreparable', 'mistakes', 'end', 'embarrassment', 'fragile', 'mother', 'build', 'up', 'phenomenally', 'hysterical', 'showdown', 'wrestling', 'mat', 'gym', 'Even', 'when', 'little', 'contests', 'competitions', 'Woodcock', 'such', 'corn', 'cob', 'eating', 'contest', 'girl', 'love', 'interest', 'Melissa', 'Sagemiller', 'due', 'obnoxious', 'victory', 'most', 'unique', 'aspect', 'Woodcock', 'lack', 'dream', 'sequences', 'scenes', ""'d"", 'expect', 'be', 'imagined', 'So', 'often', 'main', 'characters', 'only', 'daydream', 'getting', 'revenge', 'openly', 'speaking', 'out', 'antagonist', 'Mr.', 'Woodcock', 'Farley', 'actually', 'do', 'applause-inducing', 'retribution', 'would', 'be', 'out-of-line', 'anyone', 'other', 'Sean', 'William', 'Scott.The', 'comedy', 'performances', 'Mr.', 'Woodcock', 'are', 'really', 'what', 'clinch', 'distinctiveness', 'other', 'run-of-the-mill', 'comedies', 'chemistry', 'Scott', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'amazing', 'opposite', 'personalities', 'clash', 'onscreen', 'perfect', 'comedy', 'contrast', 'Great', 'one-liners', 'everyone', 'help', 'keep', 'laughs', 'constant', 'supporting', 'cast', 'member', 'Amy', 'Poehler', 'cake', 'cranky', 'absurd', 'spurts', 'angry', 'dialogue', 'great', 'see', 'film', 'more', 'funny', 'bits', 'what', 'was', 'revealed', 'trailer.Such', 'comedic', 'premise', 'up', 'sorts', 'possibilities', 'Mr.', 'Woodcock', 'simplistically', 'straightforward', 'possible', 'lack', 'twists', 'turns', 'plot', 'may', 'be', 'bigger', 'shock', 'dreamt', 'up', 'several', 'points', 'film', 'might', 'expect', 'Farley', 'suddenly', 'wake', 'up', 'realize', 'did', ""n't"", 'just', 'say', 'do', 'things', 'actually', 'did', 'spontaneity', 'character', 'actions', 'generally', 'desired', 'behavior', 'Woodcock', 'extremely', 'enjoyable', 'time', 'only', 'few', 'scenes', 'stand', 'out', 'side-splittingly', 'hilarious', ""'ll"", 'know', 'ones', 'unintentional', 'realism', 'satisfying', 'candidness', 'might', 'make', 'linger', 'time', 'after.-', 'Massie', 'Twins']",N/A
1118654,A2IL4AJIXXXLEM,B000YDKA94,the smart guy,"[0, 0]",For the most part this movie has a good heart.  The P.E. coach Mr. Woodcock is a very popular guy. Everyone looks past his snide and bullying coaching methods. The only one who doesn't look past it is Sean William Scott's character named Farley. Farley is seen at the start of the movie being bullied by Mr. Woodcock. As an adult Farley becomes a self-help motivational writer. The battle between Mr. Woodcock and Farley begins when Mr. Woodcock begins to court his mom. Everything goes down hill for Farley. And he starts using many mischievous techniques to sabotage the relationship. There are many hilarious moments. And this movie doesn't take itself seriously and neither should you.

1118655,A3UI00DVXAJLW4,B000YDKA94,"Tony ""Ynot""","[3, 4]","I love Seann William Scott.  I think he has great comedic timing.  But even with him sugar-coating it, he can make this show's message tolerable.Mr. Woodcock is a gym teacher that verbally abuses, and sometimes physically abuses his kids.  But hey, that's ok when we find out that his father was even worse that he was.  Oh yeah, let's not forget that Woodcock make Seann's mom sooo happy... so he Seann must help them stay together.Let me give you a dose of reality: How someone treats the world is eventually how they will treat you.  Maybe not in the first year, maybe not even in the second year, but eventually you will find yourself on the receiving end of the personality.To many women already go into a relationship with blinders on, we don't need a comedy saying it's okay to marry a jerk as long as there are reasons from his past that are sad and he treats you good.Also, the fact that this show paints this students as grateful for the push they needed.... I was verbally abuse to the point of tears by a teacher and although I got past it, it certianly didn't help me in any way!",1,It's ok to be an Jerk and abuse kids  if you have a bad past and mean well?,1207267200,"04 4, 2008",2008,1092,"['love', 'Seann', 'William', 'Scott', 'think', 'great', 'comedic', 'timing', 'even', 'sugar-coating', 'can', 'make', 'show', 'message', 'tolerable.Mr', 'Woodcock', 'gym', 'teacher', 'verbally', 'sometimes', 'physically', 'kids', 'hey', 'ok', 'when', 'find', 'out', 'father', 'was', 'even', 'worse', 'was', 'Oh', 'yeah', 'let', 'not', 'forget', 'Woodcock', 'make', 'Seann', 'mom', 'sooo', 'happy', 'so', 'Seann', 'must', 'help', 'stay', 'give', 'dose', 'reality', 'How', 'someone', 'world', 'eventually', 'how', 'will', 'treat', 'Maybe', 'not', 'first', 'year', 'maybe', 'not', 'even', 'second', 'year', 'eventually', 'will', 'find', 'receiving', 'end', 'personality.To', 'many', 'women', 'already', 'go', 'relationship', 'blinders', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'comedy', 'saying', 'okay', 'marry', 'jerk', 'as', 'long', 'are', 'reasons', 'past', 'are', 'sad', 'good.Also', 'fact', 'show', 'students', 'grateful', 'push', 'needed', 'was', 'verbally', 'abuse', 'point', 'tears', 'teacher', 'got', 'certianly', 'did', ""n't"", 'help', 'way']",N/A

The facial expressions of the actors throughout the movie, as well as the one-liners, are what made it so funny.  The dry humor of Billy Bob Thornton and Seann Scott's reactions to his character were awesome!  The blu-ray quality is great.
