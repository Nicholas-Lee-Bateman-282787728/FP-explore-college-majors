Newcomers will take a few moments to adjust to it though, as Izzard's English material (a line about Devon gets a big laugh) and transvestitism may throw them a bit.This is a 1994 show, and even then, Izzard's ""Star Trek"" material must have been dated. But the man is so affable, by the time he's talking about different settings for phasers, you're chuckling in spite of yourself. Other bits are even more far-fetched: If bees make honey, why don't earwhigs make chutney?

However, for fans of Eddie, this is a very solid performance.  It was done in 1994, but none of the material is dated as he focuses more on universal things (like Star Trek) than on topical things.The audio sounds a bit tinny, as if they were recording from the speakers (the audio on later performances is much better).That aside, being that its an older show, you might not have heard some of these jokes.

What an original. It's no wonder he is huge with his fans.I've seen later shows and probably laughed louder, but this West End performance from earlier in his career, 1994, does not disappoint. Made from a single performance (rather than assembled from the best parts of several), there are moments that don't quite work, but given Izzard's style of delivery, these are even comic and you wouldn't want to miss them.Often compared to the brilliance of Robin Williams, Izzard is all himself and nobody else. This particular DVD actually has a commentary of Izzard talking about his own performance (recorded about 10 years later) and a silly ""trivia commentary"" with odd facts about the subject matter he is discussing, e.g., that in Holland it is illegal to shop in a grocery store without a cart?
