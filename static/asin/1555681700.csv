177723,A3N6AN218WXLXP,1555681700,"Bryan Leech ""Bryan""","[0, 0]","I am somewhat confused as advertisements for the original DVD release advised a 12 hour complete version or the 6 hour condensation. Whichever is correct, but for the very rough cuts - a most un-professional reduction, I found this very rewarding and enjoyable. In the few reviews I read, no-one seems to have noticed that this is partly fictional. However, it manages to convey many of the main episodes in the book of Acts of the Apostles in a reasonably informative, and highly viewable way..I would imagine that when the DVDs were originally released, sales of the long (9, or was it 12 hours) would be small, as most viewers don't like extremely long programs - even Christian viewers. So the shorter version was released, I think, at the same time, according to the promotional material I still have from the time of the (high quality, technically speaking) DVDs. My only complaint is at the very obvious rough excisions.

177728,AI7B4WAOV11DS,1555681700,Gregory V.,"[2, 2]","My low rating for this DVD isn't because the original 1985 production was bad.  In fact, it was a fairly good TV movie - between 3 and 4 stars.  What I found extremely objectionable was that this DVD presented an edited version of the original TV special and it was a badly edited version at that.  And, I fault Amazon as well for not alerting the potential buyer that this DVD offered for sale was an edited version.The editing decision (by the producers of this DVD) was apparently to heavily edit those sections of the movie dramatizing events at the Roman imperial court.  In doing so, the flow of the story was confusing if the viewer wasn't familiar with Roman history since events referred to in passing were not shown (as they were in the original movie).  For example, the character of Sejanus, the power behind the Emperor Tiberius, was built up in a few scenes and then his character disappears without comment.  James Mason's interesting portrayal of Tiberius was heavily edited and his death scene was butchered so that the viewer doesn't know that he was murdered (as was shown in the original).  The scene introducing the Emperor Claudius in the film as portrayed by Richard Kiley (a good performance that was edited down to 60 seconds!!!) began with Claudius and the Senate meeting.  In the scene, a leading senator demands the restoration of the Republic and the deposition of Claudius.  Claudius' reply is obviously edited out as the film 'jumps' and he has a ten second 'response' demanding the deportation of the Jews from Rome which has nothing to do with the senator's opening speech!  The advertisement for this movie states that the cast includes Ava Gardner, Colleen Dewhurst, Susan Sarandon and several other major stars.  None of these actors or their performances appear in this edited version!!  Most of these stars were presented in the film credits as portraying characters at the Roman imperial court.  Again, since the editors of this DVD decided to abridge almost all of the performances relating to the Roman court, these stars' performances were casualties of this editing mess.  Again, I want to emphasize that the editing job was choppy and clumsy and, often, the viewer is left wondering what happened when the movie refers to events that were not shown or fully explained.I remember buying another DVD from Amazon some time ago called 'The Amazing Howard Hughes' with Tommy Lee Jones.  This was an outstanding movie but the DVD production sold by Amazon did a similarly bad job of editing (losing about 30 to 40 minutes from the original film).  And, again, neither Amazon nor the DVD case when received advised that  the movie had been edited.  A big disappointment!If you get a chance to purchase a FULL version of A.D., I would recommend the movie.  But, I would NOT!!! recommend buying this version with its botched editing and false advertising!In the future, Amazon, alert your customers if you are offering an abridged version of what you are selling.",1,A.D.

Somehow or other, I had not gotten around to it, until last evening....In describing this ambitious work, Amazon tells us that ""The Book of Acts comes alive in this epic....Painstakingly researched by award-winning producer Vincenzo Labella, this compelling mini-series blends Biblical narrative with historic incidents and engaging fictional characters....A.D. is the perfect resource for any church or home study group wishing to explore the New Testament period, the Early Church, or the Book of Acts.""  Based on the hour or so for which I was able to stay awake, I think that charges of reckless driving with a poetic license may be more in order!Scripture tells us that on the very day of Christ's resurrection, two disciples were traveling from Jerusalem to Emmaus and discussing all that had transpired.  Though Jesus joined them for the journey, neither initially recognized Him: ""And it happened that, while He was with them at table, He took bread, said the blessing, broke it, and gave it to them. With that their eyes were opened and they recognized Him, but He vanished from their sight. Then they said to each other, 'Were not our hearts burning [within us] while He spoke to us on the way and opened the scriptures to us?' So they set out at once and returned to Jerusalem where they found gathered together the eleven and those with them who were saying, 'The Lord has truly been raised and has appeared to Simon!' Then the two recounted what had taken place on the way and how He was made known to them in the breaking of the bread"" (Luke 24: 30-35).  My impression was that the makers of this film missed the significance of ""how He was made known to them in the breaking of the bread.""As per the scriptures, ""Thomas, called Didymus, one of the Twelve, was not with them when Jesus came. So the other disciples said to him, 'We have seen the Lord.' But he said to them, 'Unless I see the mark of the nails in his hands and put my finger into the nailmarks and put my hand into his side, I will not believe.'  Now a week later his disciples were again inside and Thomas was with them. Jesus came, although the doors were locked, and stood in their midst and said, 'Peace be with you.'  Then he said to Thomas, 'Put your finger here and see my hands, and bring your hand and put it into my side, and do not be unbelieving, but believe.'  Thomas answered and said to him, 'My Lord and my God!'"" (John 20: 24-29).  In the film, there is no week interval and Thomas remains doubting, even when he sees Jesus face to face.  It is only when he actually puts his hand into one of Jesus' wounds that he believes.  Why did the makers of the film believe such changes to be in order?  It's just confusing....And what on earth was that stuff about Saint Stephen engaged in a wrestling match?  One could get the impression that the makers of this film were trying to tell a story through the eyes of the WWE.",2,Reckless Driving with a Poetic License,1361059200,"02 17, 2013",2013,2990,"['about', '20', 'years', 'had', 'wanted', 'see', 'sequel', 'Jesus', 'Nazareth', 'Somehow', 'other', 'had', 'not', 'gotten', 'last', 'evening', 'describing', 'ambitious', 'work', 'Amazon', 'Book', 'Acts', 'alive', 'epic', '.Painstakingly', 'researched', 'award-winning', 'producer', 'Vincenzo', 'Labella', 'compelling', 'mini-series', 'blends', 'Biblical', 'narrative', 'historic', 'incidents', 'engaging', 'fictional', 'characters', '.A.D.', 'perfect', 'resource', 'church', 'home', 'study', 'group', 'wishing', 'explore', 'New', 'Testament', 'period', 'Early', 'Church', 'Book', 'Acts', 'Based', 'hour', 'so', 'was', 'able', 'stay', 'awake', 'think', 'charges', 'reckless', 'driving', 'poetic', 'license', 'may', 'be', 'more', 'order', 'Scripture', 'very', 'day', 'Christ', 'resurrection', 'two', 'disciples', 'were', 'traveling', 'Jerusalem', 'Emmaus', 'discussing', 'had', 'transpired', 'Jesus', 'joined', 'journey', 'initially', 'recognized', 'Him', 'happened', 'was', 'table', 'took', 'bread', 'said', 'blessing', 'broke', 'gave', 'eyes', 'were', 'opened', 'recognized', 'Him', 'vanished', 'sight', 'Then', 'said', 'other', 'not', 'hearts', 'burning', '[', ']', 'spoke', 'way', 'opened', 'scriptures', 'set', 'out', 'once', 'returned', 'Jerusalem', 'where', 'found', 'gathered', 'together', 'eleven', 'who', 'were', 'saying', 'Lord', 'truly', 'been', 'raised', 'appeared', 'Simon', 'Then', 'two', 'recounted', 'what', 'had', 'taken', 'place', 'way', 'how', 'was', 'made', 'known', 'breaking', 'bread', 'Luke', '24', '30-35', 'impression', 'was', 'makers', 'film', 'missed', 'significance', 'how', 'was', 'made', 'known', 'breaking', 'bread', 'scriptures', 'Thomas', 'called', 'Didymus', 'one', 'Twelve', 'was', 'not', 'when', 'Jesus', 'came', 'other', 'disciples', 'said', 'have', 'seen', 'Lord', 'said', 'see', 'mark', 'nails', 'hands', 'put', 'finger', 'nailmarks', 'put', 'hand', 'side', 'will', 'not', 'believe', 'Now', 'week', 'later', 'disciples', 'were', 'again', 'inside', 'Thomas', 'was', 'Jesus', 'came', 'doors', 'were', 'locked', 'stood', 'midst', 'said', 'be', 'Then', 'said', 'Thomas', 'finger', 'here', 'see', 'hands', 'bring', 'hand', 'put', 'side', 'do', 'not', 'be', 'unbelieving', 'believe', 'Thomas', 'answered', 'said', 'Lord', 'God', 'John', '20', '24-29', 'film', 'week', 'interval', 'Thomas', 'doubting', 'even', 'when', 'Jesus', 'face', 'face', 'only', 'when', 'actually', 'hand', 'one', 'Jesus', 'wounds', 'Why', 'did', 'makers', 'film', 'believe', 'such', 'changes', 'be', 'order', 'just', 'confusing', 'what', 'earth', 'was', 'stuff', 'Saint', 'Stephen', 'engaged', 'wrestling', 'match', 'One', 'could', 'get', 'impression', 'makers', 'film', 'were', 'trying', 'tell', 'story', 'eyes', 'WWE']",N/A

Further, although the religious commentary is interesting for someone like myself who has spent decades studying such things, it wears on you quickly as its far too much, poured on you without any breaks or interruptions.  As it lacks context, its much like sitting down with the dictionary in the hopes of enjoying a good novel.  You get a lot of data but that's about it.Further, the complete series played as a counter-point, with the Roman factions reflecting the intolerance of the Early church.  As the Christians grew more accepting, the Romans did as well and you could see the foundations being built for the Early church to rise.  Almost all of the Roman scenes are gone and those that are left are badly mangled.  A. D. was written in that the reflections of the two societies gave meaning to most of what it showed.  As one side of the reflection is gone, it now seems like a lot of rambling.Additionally, on a technical level, the transfer does not play well on an HDTV.  It seems to have been copied from a video tape that was sitting in someone's closet.  The sound plays acceptably but the picture is well below what I would call an acceptable standard.  I take it that this is all the producer had available and if it were complete, I'd say it was better than nothing but given all the hacks done to this miniseries, I say that nothing is better than this.Avoid this version, even if you get it at a big discount.  Its truly not even worth the price of shipping.",1,From Great MiniSeries to Half-Assed Bible Lesson,1325116800,"12 29, 2011",2011,2228,"['Loved', 'mini-series', 'when', 'showed', 'television', 'Would', 'love', 'have', 'again', 'version', 'been', 'hacked', 'up', 'worse', 'small', 'frog', 'tossed', 'blender', 'menu', 'choices', 'are', 'PLAY', 'MOVIE', 'go', 'Bible', 'Study', 'material', 'first', 'hint', 'set', 'actually', 'course', 'study', 'disc', 'Bible', 'Study', 'course', 'Anything', 'everything', ""n't"", 'directly', 'support', 'Sunday', 'School', 'lesson', 'plan', 'been', 'chopped', 'out', 'most', 'what', 'made', 'miniseries', 'really', 'good.What', 'left', 'lot', 'good', 'scenes', 'very', 'well', 'acted', 'nicely', 'shot', 'play', 'sledgehammers', 'knocking', 'skull', 'just', 'one', 'continuous', 'theological', 'discussion', 'only', 'weak', 'framework', 'wondering', 'what', 'going', 'Further', 'religious', 'commentary', 'interesting', 'someone', 'myself', 'who', 'spent', 'decades', 'studying', 'such', 'things', 'quickly', 'far', 'too', 'much', 'poured', 'breaks', 'interruptions', 'context', 'much', 'sitting', 'down', 'dictionary', 'hopes', 'enjoying', 'good', 'novel', 'get', 'lot', 'data', 'it.Further', 'complete', 'series', 'played', 'counter-point', 'Roman', 'factions', 'reflecting', 'intolerance', 'Early', 'church', 'Christians', 'grew', 'more', 'accepting', 'Romans', 'did', 'as', 'well', 'could', 'see', 'foundations', 'being', 'built', 'Early', 'church', 'rise', 'Almost', 'Roman', 'scenes', 'are', 'gone', 'are', 'left', 'are', 'badly', 'mangled', 'A.', 'D.', 'was', 'written', 'reflections', 'two', 'societies', 'gave', 'meaning', 'most', 'what', 'showed', 'one', 'side', 'reflection', 'gone', 'now', 'lot', 'rambling.Additionally', 'technical', 'level', 'transfer', 'not', 'play', 'well', 'HDTV', 'have', 'been', 'copied', 'video', 'tape', 'was', 'sitting', 'someone', 'closet', 'sound', 'acceptably', 'picture', 'well', 'what', 'would', 'call', 'acceptable', 'standard', 'take', 'producer', 'had', 'available', 'were', 'complete', ""'d"", 'say', 'was', 'better', 'nothing', 'given', 'hacks', 'done', 'miniseries', 'say', 'nothing', 'better', 'this.Avoid', 'version', 'even', 'get', 'big', 'discount', 'truly', 'not', 'even', 'price', 'shipping']",N/A
177738,ATB8MP2M9L5PM,1555681700,"Transcendental Thomist ""jeb815""","[0, 0]","The made-for-TV film &#34;A.D.&#34; (1985) is the third part of a Bible TV miniseries trilogy produced by Vincenzo Labella and scripted by English Catholic-bred writer Anthony Burgess (&#34;A Clockwork Orange&#34;) from his novels. Franco Zefferelli directed the middle installment -- &#34;Jesus of Nazareth&#34; (1977) -- of this series that started with the modest-but-compelling &#34;Moses the Lawgiver&#34; (1975) starring Burt Lancaster. While &#34;Jesus of Nazareth&#34; is a beloved 6-hour classic that is readily available on DVD and frequently shown on TV, both &#34;Moses the Lawgiver&#34; and &#34;A.D.&#34; are rare viewing experiences, available only in heavily edited DVD releases. This &#34;AD&#34; is a two-disc set that compresses the miniseries from 12 to 6 hours, making it somewhat hard to follow at times when the scenes abruptly end in a cheap freeze-frame effect, but it appears to contain the gist of the story.I bought the DVD used from Amazon because I've never seen more than a few minutes of it. Like &#34;Jesus of Nazareth,&#34; the &#34;A.D.&#34; miniseries features many of the top actors/actresses of its day, with extremely high production values. The cast includes Anthony Andrews (Sebastian Flyte in &#34;Brideshead Revisited,&#34; the reigning miniseries of the 1980s) as Nero, Susan Sarandon, James Mason, John Houseman, David Hedison, Jack Warden, Richard Roundtree, Colleen Dewhurst, Ava Gardner, Richard Kiley, Anthony Zerbe, Paul Freeman, Vernon Dobtcheff, ad nauseum. Ian McShane is the only actor returning from &#34;Jesus of Nazareth&#34; and there is a good Lalo Schifrin score with Enrico Sabbatini costumes. The lions and extras in the colosseum scenes are real, not CGI, as the film had a $30 million budget and aired primetime on NBC. High quality stuff for 1985.Despite being a ratings hit in 1985, and one of the few credible versions of &#34;Acts of the Apostles&#34; on film, this series has inexplicably disappeared from TV rotations. As NBC prepares to reboot this material with Roma Downey and Mark Burnett's &#34;A.D.&#34; miniseries (same title) in 2015, as a follow up to their &#34;The Bible&#34; miniseries on History Channel and &#34;Son of God&#34; theatrical release, this older version of Acts is worth a look. Unfortunately, the miniseries spends more time on fictionalized Roman subplots than on the Biblical text, frequently losing its focus. But there are some good moments, including the appearance of the Risen Jesus to the disciples on the road to Emmaus, that recall some of the power of Zeffirelli's masterpiece.",3,Sequel to Zeffirelli's 'Jesus of Nazareth' is occasionally stirring,1397865600,"04 19, 2014",2014,2586,"['made-for-TV', 'film', '34', 'A.D.', '34', '1985', 'third', 'part', 'Bible', 'TV', 'miniseries', 'trilogy', 'produced', 'Vincenzo', 'Labella', 'scripted', 'English', 'Catholic-bred', 'writer', 'Anthony', 'Burgess', '34', 'A', 'Clockwork', 'Orange', '34', 'novels', 'Franco', 'Zefferelli', 'directed', 'middle', 'installment', '34', 'Jesus', 'Nazareth', '34', '1977', 'series', 'started', 'modest-but-compelling', '34', 'Lawgiver', '34', '1975', 'starring', 'Burt', 'Lancaster', '34', 'Jesus', 'Nazareth', '34', 'beloved', '6-hour', 'classic', 'readily', 'available', 'DVD', 'frequently', 'shown', 'TV', '34', 'Lawgiver', '34', '34', 'A.D.', '34', 'are', 'rare', 'viewing', 'experiences', 'available', 'only', 'heavily', 'edited', 'DVD', '34', 'AD', '34', 'two-disc', 'set', 'miniseries', '12', '6', 'hours', 'making', 'somewhat', 'hard', 'follow', 'times', 'when', 'scenes', 'abruptly', 'end', 'cheap', 'freeze-frame', 'effect', 'contain', 'gist', 'story.I', 'bought', 'DVD', 'used', 'Amazon', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'more', 'few', 'minutes', '34', 'Jesus', 'Nazareth', '34', '34', 'A.D.', '34', 'miniseries', 'many', 'top', 'actors/actresses', 'day', 'extremely', 'high', 'production', 'values', 'cast', 'Anthony', 'Andrews', 'Sebastian', 'Flyte', '34', 'Brideshead', 'Revisited', '34', 'reigning', 'miniseries', '1980s', 'Nero', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'James', 'Mason', 'John', 'Houseman', 'David', 'Hedison', 'Jack', 'Warden', 'Richard', 'Roundtree', 'Colleen', 'Dewhurst', 'Ava', 'Gardner', 'Richard', 'Kiley', 'Anthony', 'Zerbe', 'Paul', 'Freeman', 'Vernon', 'Dobtcheff', 'ad', 'nauseum', 'Ian', 'McShane', 'only', 'actor', 'returning', '34', 'Jesus', 'Nazareth', '34', 'good', 'Lalo', 'Schifrin', 'score', 'Enrico', 'Sabbatini', 'costumes', 'lions', 'extras', 'colosseum', 'scenes', 'are', 'real', 'not', 'CGI', 'film', 'had', '30', 'million', 'budget', 'aired', 'primetime', 'NBC', 'High', 'quality', 'stuff', '1985.Despite', 'being', 'ratings', 'hit', '1985', 'one', 'few', 'credible', 'versions', '34', 'Acts', 'Apostles', '34', 'film', 'series', 'inexplicably', 'disappeared', 'TV', 'rotations', 'NBC', 'reboot', 'material', 'Roma', 'Downey', 'Mark', 'Burnett', '34', 'A.D.', '34', 'miniseries', 'same', 'title', '2015', 'follow', 'up', '34', 'Bible', '34', 'miniseries', 'History', 'Channel', '34', 'Son', 'God', '34', 'theatrical', 'release', 'older', 'version', 'Acts', 'look', 'Unfortunately', 'miniseries', 'more', 'time', 'fictionalized', 'Roman', 'subplots', 'Biblical', 'text', 'frequently', 'losing', 'focus', 'are', 'good', 'moments', 'including', 'appearance', 'Risen', 'Jesus', 'disciples', 'road', 'Emmaus', 'recall', 'power', 'Zeffirelli', 'masterpiece']",N/A
