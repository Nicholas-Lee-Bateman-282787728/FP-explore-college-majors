320234,APL8860V2DVOB,6302561760,CB Twelve,"[1, 1]","I jumped to buy this tape because I was blown away by Cher's New Attitude which has an over the top toning segment.  But with this video, the aerobics is ridiculously long, 45 minutes.  20 minutes is plenty for any aerobic routine; even Jane Fonda's Workout Challenge has a 20 minute aerobic segment.  I found it to be boring because it's too long, but I could over look that if this video contained an ab workout, which it doesn't.  The workout is 90 minutes long like her first video.  Who ever heard of a 90 minute workout that doesn't include the abs?  Gee, after 90 minutes, you still have to put in more time to work your abs!  Ridiculous!  However, the toning part with the rubber bands is over the top!  I love it!  This is why I give the tape 3 stars. Cher still managed to come through.  It would have gotten 5 if the aerobics were shorter and it had a ab workout.  What I'll do is skip the aerobics altogether and just do the toning part.  The rubber band thing is awesome!  I recommend that you try it, you'll love it!  But pair it up with another workout for your abs and aerobics.  The toning part is only 45 minutes.",3,Both Ridiculous and Somewhat Great!!,1215475200,"07 8, 2008",2008,1131,"['jumped', 'buy', 'tape', 'was', 'blown', 'away', 'Cher', 'New', 'Attitude', 'top', 'toning', 'segment', 'video', 'aerobics', 'ridiculously', 'long', '45', 'minutes', '20', 'minutes', 'plenty', 'aerobic', 'routine', 'even', 'Jane', 'Fonda', 'Workout', 'Challenge', '20', 'minute', 'aerobic', 'segment', 'found', 'be', 'boring', 'too', 'long', 'could', 'over', 'look', 'video', 'contained', 'ab', 'workout', ""n't"", 'workout', '90', 'minutes', 'long', 'first', 'video', 'Who', 'ever', 'heard', '90', 'minute', 'workout', ""n't"", 'include', 'abs', 'Gee', '90', 'minutes', 'still', 'have', 'put', 'more', 'time', 'work', 'abs', 'Ridiculous', 'However', 'toning', 'part', 'rubber', 'top', 'love', 'why', 'give', 'tape', '3', 'stars', 'Cher', 'still', 'managed', 'come', 'would', 'have', 'gotten', '5', 'aerobics', 'were', 'shorter', 'had', 'ab', 'workout', 'What', ""'ll"", 'do', 'skip', 'aerobics', 'altogether', 'just', 'do', 'toning', 'part', 'rubber', 'band', 'thing', 'awesome', 'recommend', 'try', ""'ll"", 'love', 'pair', 'up', 'workout', 'abs', 'aerobics', 'toning', 'part', 'only', '45', 'minutes']",CherFitness: Body Confidence VHS

Now, I am the person who has ton of workout videos, and I have been working out in the gym for over several years.  I have also trained with a great personal trainer, so I'm not a newcomer to working out.  When I saw this video with Cher, I was flabergasted that she would put out this kind of nonsese!  First, she wore ton of makeup and her hair is huge like a prostute's hair.  She also wore some stylish booths, which I thought she should have worn some comfortable athletic shoes.  She also wore very revealing skimpy outfit, and wasn't a thong string go up her butt?  She should have put out this kind of video under Play Boy's title.  Cher also made some snotty coments, and that tells me that she think she is miss high and mighty!  I want to listen to someone who smiles and encourages, and not someone who acts like she is some kind of queen and make sarcastic comments.  If you are a dire hard fan of Cher, then you might like this video.  But, if you want a serious workout video, then look for videos that have won some sort of awards.",1,This is a joke!,1134259200,"12 11, 2005",2005,1179,"['saw', 'video', 'garage', 'sale', '10', 'cents', 'thought', 'try', 'out', 'could', 'not', 'help', 'whole', 'video', 'Now', 'am', 'person', 'who', 'ton', 'workout', 'videos', 'have', 'been', 'working', 'out', 'gym', 'several', 'years', 'have', 'also', 'trained', 'great', 'personal', 'trainer', ""'m"", 'not', 'newcomer', 'working', 'out', 'When', 'saw', 'video', 'Cher', 'was', 'flabergasted', 'would', 'put', 'out', 'kind', 'nonsese', 'First', 'wore', 'ton', 'makeup', 'hair', 'huge', 'prostute', 'hair', 'also', 'wore', 'stylish', 'booths', 'thought', 'should', 'have', 'worn', 'comfortable', 'athletic', 'shoes', 'also', 'wore', 'very', 'revealing', 'skimpy', 'outfit', 'was', ""n't"", 'thong', 'string', 'go', 'up', 'butt', 'should', 'have', 'put', 'out', 'kind', 'video', 'Play', 'Boy', 'title', 'Cher', 'also', 'made', 'snotty', 'coments', 'think', 'miss', 'high', 'mighty', 'want', 'listen', 'someone', 'who', 'encourages', 'not', 'someone', 'who', 'kind', 'queen', 'make', 'sarcastic', 'comments', 'are', 'dire', 'hard', 'fan', 'Cher', 'then', 'might', 'like', 'video', 'want', 'serious', 'workout', 'video', 'then', 'look', 'videos', 'have', 'won', 'sort', 'awards']",CherFitness: Body Confidence VHS
320236,A29NVDM3SSBHO2,6302561760,Karen,"[19, 19]","I love this video!  The Hot Dance really gets the heart pumping and the body sweating!  Dorian Sanchez is a wonderful and fun instructor.  I still have fun with this workout, and I've been doing it off and on for ten years!  I am not very coordinated when it comes to dancing, but I find the moves easy to follow and fun to do.  It is tough to do in a small space, but I would strongly recommend this aerobic workout if you want fun and effective.The second section in done with resistance bands and is also very good.  Personally I'm not crazy about the bands, but I'm sure you could do most of it just as well with hand weights.  I don't do this workout as often as the first, but it is good also.CHER ROCKS! :)",5,Cher scores a win again,1019433600,"04 22, 2002",2002,713,"['love', 'video', 'Hot', 'Dance', 'really', 'heart', 'pumping', 'body', 'sweating', 'Dorian', 'Sanchez', 'wonderful', 'fun', 'instructor', 'still', 'have', 'fun', 'workout', ""'ve"", 'been', 'doing', 'off', 'ten', 'years', 'am', 'not', 'very', 'coordinated', 'when', 'dancing', 'find', 'moves', 'easy', 'follow', 'fun', 'do', 'tough', 'do', 'small', 'space', 'would', 'strongly', 'recommend', 'aerobic', 'workout', 'want', 'fun', 'effective.The', 'second', 'section', 'done', 'resistance', 'bands', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'Personally', ""'m"", 'not', 'crazy', 'bands', ""'m"", 'sure', 'could', 'do', 'most', 'just', 'as', 'well', 'hand', 'weights', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'workout', 'as', 'often', 'first', 'good', 'also.CHER', 'ROCKS']",CherFitness: Body Confidence VHS
320237,A1VLCEVT52XENT,6302561760,Laura,"[4, 22]","I bought this video at a used clothing store for $1.99, and I know now that I paid way too much for it.  This video is a JOKE!  Cher looks like a total tramp, and I felt sick to my stomache whenever the camera showed her backside.  And, when they were doing the cool down, she kept pushing her crouch in and out, so that you could see her waxed bikini like (yuck!).  She has absoultely no modesty in her.  How can anyone give her any type of respect.  Also, she was not wearing a workout utfit, she was wearing a trampy outfit.  This so called ""hot dance"" is nothing more then bunch of girls gallopping like a horse and I'm not kidding you.  They take breaks seems like every 20 seconds, and the instructor says ""pony"", then they all hop around like a pony throught the entire video!  There's a huge portion of the video where the girls not only gallop around like a horse, they also say ""I'm pony, your pony, we all love out pony!"".  What the hell is this? I can't even describe the rest of the exercises.  Well, maybe I can describe it this way.  They go from side to side, then they move their arm forward and backword while they move one side of their leg up and down sidewards.  It looks so stupid!  They kept doing this movie over and over.  Also, throw in the pony moves and that's what they called the hot dance.

320238,A1HGLDJMQY213B,6302561760,Lisa,"[26, 27]","This workout is divided into two sections: the first is a 38 minute fat-burning aerobic dance workout and the second is a gruelling all-over body workout using resistance bands.The &quot;Hot Dance&quot; workout is led by top choreographer, Doriana Sanchez. Sanchez has choreographed Cher's stage shows and videos; was one of the dancers in the Patrick Swayze film, Dirty Dancing; choreographed the live Dirty Dancing shows; Copacabana and many other popular shows. Anyone who has Cher's first workout tape will remember Sanchez as the one on the floor without the step :-) This workout is fun and you go straight into the warm-up and then on to building up the dance routine little by little. Some of the steps are a little bit tricky and yes, it is a little repetitive but thats all to the good and the moves are demanding enough that even if you mentally wished it was longer and more varied, your body is perfectly happy with the workout as it is :-)  Overall the first workout is fun to do and it doesn't get old. The music isn't as good as Cher's last fitness tape but it's still good enough to workout with especially when you bear in mind that this tape was made ten years ago! Like a lot of dance workouts, you're not going to use this to put on your own show, but it's great for burning fat and I find that I see results straight away. Cher's workout tapes are the ones I use when I need to lose weight. I'd recommend using this with Cindy Crawford's Next Challenge [fabulous for toning, strengthening and stamina] They're fun and maybe I'm in the minority but I actually loved Cher's workout gear :o)Workout two is a 45 minute killer. Although this workout is designed to be used with resistance bands, you can do it just as well using weights. This workout is very intense and it's very encouraging to see Cher expressing the same pain you are feeling as you are put throught the moves. The results are very good but can I say.... OW! It really is difficult. Even the super-fit will struggle with this workout at first, because of its intensity and because it works those muscles that don't often get used.",4,Recommended,1016323200,"03 17, 2002",2002,2117,"['workout', 'divided', 'two', 'sections', 'first', '38', 'minute', 'fat-burning', 'aerobic', 'dance', 'workout', 'second', 'gruelling', 'all-over', 'body', 'using', 'resistance', 'bands.The', 'quot', 'Hot', 'Dance', 'quot', 'workout', 'led', 'top', 'choreographer', 'Doriana', 'Sanchez', 'Sanchez', 'choreographed', 'Cher', 'stage', 'shows', 'videos', 'was', 'one', 'dancers', 'Patrick', 'Swayze', 'film', 'Dirty', 'Dancing', 'choreographed', 'live', 'Dirty', 'Dancing', 'Copacabana', 'many', 'other', 'popular', 'shows', 'Anyone', 'who', 'Cher', 'first', 'workout', 'tape', 'will', 'remember', 'Sanchez', 'one', 'floor', 'step', 'workout', 'fun', 'go', 'straight', 'warm-up', 'then', 'building', 'up', 'dance', 'routine', 'little', 'little', 'steps', 'are', 'little', 'bit', 'tricky', 'yes', 'little', 'repetitive', 'good', 'moves', 'are', 'demanding', 'even', 'mentally', 'wished', 'was', 'longer', 'more', 'varied', 'body', 'perfectly', 'happy', 'workout', 'first', 'workout', 'fun', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'old', 'music', ""n't"", 'as', 'good', 'Cher', 'last', 'fitness', 'tape', 'still', 'good', 'enough', 'workout', 'especially', 'when', 'bear', 'mind', 'tape', 'was', 'made', 'ten', 'years', 'ago', 'lot', 'dance', 'workouts', ""'re"", 'not', 'going', 'use', 'put', 'own', 'show', 'great', 'burning', 'fat', 'find', 'see', 'results', 'straight', 'away', 'Cher', 'workout', 'tapes', 'are', 'ones', 'use', 'when', 'need', 'lose', 'weight', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'using', 'Cindy', 'Crawford', 'Next', 'Challenge', '[', 'fabulous', 'toning', 'strengthening', 'stamina', ']', ""'re"", 'fun', 'maybe', ""'m"", 'minority', 'actually', 'loved', 'Cher', 'workout', 'gear', 'o', 'two', '45', 'minute', 'killer', 'workout', 'designed', 'be', 'used', 'resistance', 'bands', 'can', 'do', 'just', 'as', 'well', 'using', 'weights', 'workout', 'very', 'intense', 'very', 'encouraging', 'see', 'Cher', 'expressing', 'same', 'pain', 'are', 'feeling', 'are', 'put', 'moves', 'results', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'can', 'say', 'OW', 'really', 'difficult', 'Even', 'super-fit', 'will', 'struggle', 'workout', 'first', 'intensity', 'muscles', 'do', ""n't"", 'often', 'get', 'used']",CherFitness: Body Confidence VHS
