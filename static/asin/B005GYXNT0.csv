1460771,A2E1EFNIZL2FVA,B005GYXNT0,&#9899;   RIZZO   &#9899;,"[3, 4]","Kathy Smith, age 61 has been an exercise guru for a long time and has sold over 16 million videos since the 1980s.  She has the body to prove that she has cared for her body continuously.  Well, there are the new fake books that have not been place well, and of course the facelifts.  But, other than that, she is toned.  So, you have an expert here, not someone who jumps on the bandwagon.And, that Kathy is over 60, indicates she will perform the workout in a safe manner for the more mature woman.  The best exercise on the Total Circuit is the balance workout.  It is critical for the mature exerciser to always incorporate this into their workout.  She does an extensive workout helping one keep that balance, especially as one ages.The DVD is a compilation of three 30-minute workouts, that include cardio, energy, lightweights, balance and some aspects of Yoga.  The workouts are not difficult, and at 20 minutes, you can do just that much or extend for more.  Like most workouts, the music is annoying, but here it is light in the background.This is light on the body, easy on the stretch and most of all, it is divided into sections that allow you to workout a little, or go all the way.  ......Rizzo",5,"From an exercise guru; light, easy, fulfilling",1338249600,"05 29, 2012",2012,1209,"['Kathy', 'Smith', 'age', '61', 'been', 'exercise', 'guru', 'long', 'time', 'sold', '16', 'million', 'videos', '1980s', 'body', 'prove', 'cared', 'body', 'continuously', 'Well', 'are', 'new', 'fake', 'books', 'have', 'not', 'been', 'place', 'well', 'course', 'facelifts', 'other', 'toned', 'So', 'have', 'expert', 'here', 'not', 'someone', 'who', 'bandwagon.And', 'Kathy', '60', 'will', 'perform', 'workout', 'safe', 'manner', 'more', 'mature', 'woman', 'best', 'exercise', 'Total', 'Circuit', 'balance', 'workout', 'critical', 'mature', 'exerciser', 'always', 'incorporate', 'workout', 'extensive', 'workout', 'helping', 'one', 'keep', 'balance', 'especially', 'one', 'ages.The', 'DVD', 'compilation', 'three', '30-minute', 'workouts', 'include', 'cardio', 'energy', 'lightweights', 'balance', 'aspects', 'Yoga', 'workouts', 'are', 'not', 'difficult', '20', 'minutes', 'can', 'do', 'just', 'that', 'much', 'extend', 'more', 'most', 'workouts', 'music', 'annoying', 'here', 'light', 'background.This', 'light', 'body', 'easy', 'stretch', 'most', 'divided', 'sections', 'allow', 'workout', 'little', 'go', 'way', 'Rizzo']",AGELESS WITH KATHY SMITH: TOTAL BODY TURNAROUND

I loved seeing her in this DVD, looking just as fit as she did 20 years ago.  This DVD is separated into three segments: Total Circuit, Total Balance and Total Energy.  If you're in a pinch for time, you can pick one.  If you've got an hour and want to really boost your workout, you can do all three together.I'm picky about my workout DVDs.  I don't like hectic cuing or fake perma-smiles.  This one was great - Kathy is mellow, encouraging and fun.  There were a variety of exercises and positions, and it was perfect for the beginner-intermediate stage.  I'd say that while it is geared towards those who are getting older as far as maintaining balance and coordination and not too crazy dance moves, it was still fun and a good switch-up for me.

1460773,A2AYYKD4OODSLY,B005GYXNT0,"April E. ""just a mom""","[1, 1]","Kathy Smith's Total Body Turnaround DVD has 3 different 20-minute segments on it.  The first segment contains a mixture of cardio movements and muscle toning weight-lifting segments.When I first tried Kathy Smith's Total Body Turnaround, I found it very difficult to follow her cardio portions.  Her moves are so exaggerated that I found it hard to follow what she was doing. Every other cardio workout I've used has had easier to follow movements and a more natural rhythm.  I often found myself just standing there watching her cardio for a minute before I could even attempt it.  I would still be trying to get the hang of it when she'd change the move again, then I'd have to try to figure out the new move.  However, the toning sections were good and I definitely felt the burn.The second section is a balance-building workout that mixes cardio with balance poses.  This section borrows strongly from ballet and dance, and it really works your abs, legs and rear end.  The balance section is harder for my husband than for me, but it's good practice for combating the loss of balance that comes with age.The third section borrows from yoga to stretch the muscles and energize the body.  This is my husband's favorite section since he's working on increasing his flexibility.  But in the final minutes of this segment, she moves into a dance-type segment which includes chest-circles, hip circles, ankle circles and wrist circles which isn't very masculine at all.  We could both do without those final five minutes.I honestly was ready to give up on this DVD after my first viewing.  But my husband had me give it a second and third try, doing the workout with me.  I have found that I'm getting the hang of her cardio portions more now, but I still can't do them exactly like her.  I think the issue is partly that she is so long-limbed and flexible that her body can move in ways most people can not.  If you try to look exactly like her, you won't succeed.  Either that or it just takes someone familiar with Kathy Smith's workouts to handle the cardio sections smoothly.Letting myself give her some grace on what feels like uncoordinated cardio segments, though, this DVD is a nice addition to my workout collection and routine.  I prefer using the whole DVD at once, in a longer 60 minute workout, rather than doing the workouts individually. If I can't fit in 60 minutes, I try 40 minutes.  I've never done 20 minutes alone.The DVD is marketed to combat the aging process: toning sagging muscles, improving balance and flexibility, and increasing energy.  However, my husband and I are 38 and 39, and currently working to get back in shape. We are each moderately overweight and were surprised at how weak our muscles had become when we started this journey to better health several months ago.  I honestly can not see someone in their 50s or 60s being able to tackle this DVD unless they were already in good shape.  My mother-in-law could not have done this workout in her 50s, and she isn't overweight at all.  The difficult to follow cardio segments would be the biggest issue.  We both look and feel like idiots trying to follow Kathy Smith in the cardio sections, and I don't usually feel that way in cardio workouts.  That is the biggest complaint I have about this workout.The Total Body Turnaround DVD is definitely geared for women.  My husband is a champ for doing this workout more than once.  I think most men would do it once, and then never again.  The feminine dance segments would send them running, and feeling like an idiot in the cardio sections would be the last straw for most men.It will take several viewings to be able to feel accomplished with the cardio sections, but it is worth it to keep trying.  Even if you can't do the cardio exactly like Kathy, doing your best to imitate her will elevate your heart rate and work your entire body. The other portions of the DVD definitely make it worthwhile to push through the cardio portions.",4,"Good overall workout, hard to follow at first.",1334534400,"04 16, 2012",2012,3973,"['Kathy', 'Smith', 'Total', 'Body', 'Turnaround', 'DVD', '3', 'different', '20-minute', 'segments', 'first', 'segment', 'mixture', 'cardio', 'movements', 'muscle', 'toning', 'weight-lifting', 'segments.When', 'first', 'tried', 'Kathy', 'Smith', 'Total', 'Body', 'Turnaround', 'found', 'very', 'difficult', 'follow', 'cardio', 'portions', 'moves', 'are', 'so', 'exaggerated', 'found', 'hard', 'follow', 'what', 'was', 'doing', 'other', 'cardio', ""'ve"", 'used', 'had', 'easier', 'follow', 'movements', 'more', 'natural', 'rhythm', 'often', 'found', 'just', 'standing', 'there', 'watching', 'cardio', 'minute', 'could', 'even', 'attempt', 'would', 'still', 'be', 'trying', 'get', 'hang', 'when', ""'d"", 'change', 'move', 'again', 'then', ""'d"", 'have', 'try', 'figure', 'out', 'new', 'move', 'However', 'toning', 'sections', 'were', 'good', 'definitely', 'felt', 'burn.The', 'second', 'section', 'balance-building', 'workout', 'cardio', 'balance', 'poses', 'section', 'strongly', 'ballet', 'dance', 'really', 'abs', 'legs', 'rear', 'end', 'balance', 'section', 'harder', 'husband', 'good', 'practice', 'combating', 'loss', 'balance', 'age.The', 'third', 'section', 'borrows', 'yoga', 'stretch', 'muscles', 'energize', 'body', 'husband', 'favorite', 'section', 'working', 'increasing', 'flexibility', 'final', 'minutes', 'segment', 'dance-type', 'segment', 'chest-circles', 'hip', 'circles', 'ankle', 'circles', 'wrist', 'circles', ""n't"", 'very', 'masculine', 'could', 'both', 'do', 'final', 'five', 'minutes.I', 'honestly', 'was', 'ready', 'give', 'up', 'DVD', 'first', 'viewing', 'husband', 'had', 'give', 'second', 'third', 'try', 'doing', 'workout', 'have', 'found', ""'m"", 'getting', 'hang', 'cardio', 'portions', 'more', 'now', 'still', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'exactly', 'think', 'issue', 'partly', 'so', 'long-limbed', 'flexible', 'body', 'can', 'move', 'ways', 'most', 'people', 'can', 'not', 'try', 'look', 'exactly', 'wo', ""n't"", 'succeed', 'just', 'someone', 'familiar', 'Kathy', 'Smith', 'workouts', 'handle', 'cardio', 'sections', 'smoothly.Letting', 'give', 'grace', 'what', 'feels', 'uncoordinated', 'cardio', 'segments', 'though', 'DVD', 'nice', 'addition', 'workout', 'collection', 'routine', 'prefer', 'using', 'whole', 'DVD', 'once', 'longer', '60', 'minute', 'workout', 'rather', 'doing', 'workouts', 'individually', 'ca', ""n't"", 'fit', '60', 'minutes', 'try', '40', 'minutes', ""'ve"", 'never', 'done', '20', 'minutes', 'alone.The', 'DVD', 'marketed', 'combat', 'aging', 'process', 'toning', 'sagging', 'muscles', 'improving', 'balance', 'flexibility', 'increasing', 'energy', 'However', 'husband', 'are', '38', '39', 'currently', 'working', 'get', 'back', 'shape', 'are', 'moderately', 'overweight', 'were', 'surprised', 'how', 'weak', 'muscles', 'had', 'become', 'when', 'started', 'journey', 'better', 'health', 'several', 'months', 'honestly', 'can', 'not', 'see', 'someone', '50s', '60s', 'being', 'able', 'tackle', 'DVD', 'were', 'already', 'good', 'shape', 'mother-in-law', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'done', 'workout', '50s', ""n't"", 'overweight', 'difficult', 'follow', 'cardio', 'segments', 'would', 'be', 'biggest', 'issue', 'look', 'feel', 'idiots', 'trying', 'follow', 'Kathy', 'Smith', 'cardio', 'sections', 'do', ""n't"", 'usually', 'feel', 'way', 'cardio', 'workouts', 'biggest', 'complaint', 'have', 'workout.The', 'Total', 'Body', 'Turnaround', 'DVD', 'definitely', 'geared', 'women', 'husband', 'champ', 'doing', 'workout', 'more', 'once', 'think', 'most', 'men', 'would', 'do', 'once', 'then', 'never', 'again', 'feminine', 'dance', 'segments', 'would', 'send', 'running', 'feeling', 'idiot', 'cardio', 'sections', 'would', 'be', 'last', 'straw', 'most', 'men.It', 'will', 'take', 'several', 'viewings', 'be', 'able', 'feel', 'accomplished', 'cardio', 'sections', 'worth', 'keep', 'trying', 'Even', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'cardio', 'exactly', 'Kathy', 'doing', 'best', 'imitate', 'will', 'elevate', 'heart', 'rate', 'work', 'entire', 'body', 'other', 'portions', 'DVD', 'definitely', 'make', 'worthwhile', 'push', 'cardio', 'portions']",AGELESS WITH KATHY SMITH: TOTAL BODY TURNAROUND

1460777,AK7CAW3N1XZV6,B005GYXNT0,"Beth Cholette ""doctor_beth""","[37, 39]","This is the first Kathy Smith exercise video that I have used in a long time:  when I was more of an exercise beginner, she was a reliable part of my fitness collection, but as I became more experienced (I now considered myself to be high intermediate), I moved on to other instructors.  However, I have been curious about her ""Ageless"" series, especially now that I am getting older (mid-40s).TOTAL BODY TURNAROUND is a DVD offering 3 20-minute workout options.  The Main Menu of the DVD brings up the following options:IntroductionWorkout OptionsBonus Features (short clips from two other Acacia DVDs)Also from Acacia (other DVDs)Subtitles ON/OFFCreditsSelecting the ""Workout Options"" brings you to a submenu with choices for Play All, Total Circuit, Total Balance, or Total Energy.  For each of the workouts, Smith is exercising alone in a large, open, mostly white studio with a few colored vases accenting the background.  She instructs live, offers mirrored cuing, and occasionally (mainly during the first two workouts) gives little enthusiastic yelps.  I have described the three workouts in detail below.TOTAL CIRCUIT (actually 23.5 minutes)In this workout, Smith alternates 3 minutes of cardio with 3-minute weights segments.  She begins with a simple (3m) warm-up that includes side steps, heel touches, and knee ups.  However, she manages to significantly increase the heart rate by adding in a long series of repeater knees as well as the option of side-to-side hops.  (Note that all of the impact moves are optional in this workout.)  The first weights section consists of bent over lat rows; Smith holds two 8# weights in one hand (although she drops one weight halfway through) and rests the other hand on the seat of a chair (the only time the chair is used during the workout.  The first cardio segment begins with side steps, adding in forward motion and bow and arrow arms.  Next come side-to-side lunges with various arm movements (single, then double), again with the option of adding in a hop.  For the second weights segment, Smith performs bicep curls, adding in pulse.  She completes the set with alternating overhead presses.  The last cardio pattern begins with a simple step knee forward, alternating sides.  Smith then moves on to step repeaters (both to the rear and to the side), squats, and small squat jumps.  The final few weights moves concentrate on the legs, although Smith notes that these moves can be performed without weights as well (I actually did them with my heavy kettlebell).  The first is a one-legged deadlift, and she moves from that right into a one-legged squat (which she calls ""picking up a penny off the floor"").  She then picks up lighter weights for triceps work (extensions, lifts, and pulses) before moving to the floor for both regular and triceps push-ups.  Smith concludes this workout with a quick (1m) stretch consisting of cat/cow, down dog, and standing forward bend.  Overall, I really liked this workout; Smith gets a lot done in just over 20 minutes.  I do wish she'd given just a bit more time for the transition to the weight weight, especially because most people probably won't want to use the same set of weights throughout as she does.TOTAL BALANCE (20 minutes)Smith performs this segment barefoot.  It is a flowing workout that will still get your heart rate up at times while adding in balance work.  The warm-up consists of simple side-to-side steps, bringing the moves front-and-back and adding in single and double arm swings.  Smith begins the balance work by moving from a rear lunge to a knee balance, then bringing the leg to the front and balancing while pointing and flexing the foot.  She flows back into side-to-side steps, this time raising the back leg in a brief balance and then balancing further by lifting one leg on each side.  This is followed by a plie series (the balance work here includes work on the toes) and a very brief series in first position.  As in the first workout, Smith performs a step knee pattern that moves into rear and side repeater knees, but this time, she holds to the side, slowing bringing the knee in and out while balancing.  Side squats are next, coming up into a knee balance and ending with little front kicks.  The final series consists of a brief mini curtsey to the rear, raising up to a knee balance.  Smith concludes the workout with a short (2m) series of warrior stretches (warrior 1, warrior 2, side angle, lunge) performed all on one side, then repeated on the other side.TOTAL ENERGY (19.5 minutes)Smith again works out barefoot for this section, which is sort of a cross between yoga-like stretches and joint mobility exercises.  Although I generally enjoy this type of work, Smith's sequencing felt awkward to me (i.e., she performs stretches on one side, does some work on the stomach, and FINALLY returns to the other side), and so this was my least favorite of the three workouts.  Smith begins in a standing position, stretching the shoulders and moving into a chair/ragdoll flow.  Coming down to the floor, she starts with a brief cat/cow and then moves into the one-sided work that I mentioned earlier.  This includes bird dog (adding in an extra shoulder stretch), hip rolls in a kneeing position, one legged seated forward bend, one legged seated twist, and seated Figure 4 stretch.  Rather than moving on to the other side, Smith continues with butterfly and then comes onto the back for a brief series of back extensions before finally returning to do the second side (also, I believe that there were a few editing errors on the second side).  Following this sequence, Smith rolls down on her back for some reclined twists.  Smith returns to standing for the last 5 minutes or so of this workout.  Here she performs additional joint mobility-type stretches, targeting the shoulders, hands, wrists, and hips.Although I wasn't crazy about the third segment, I did really like the first two.  In fact, I have tried just doing those two segments together and found that it provides an excellent full-body workout, targeting both the lower and upper body (Smith includes some nice arm movements that really open up tight shoulders, a problem area for me) AND keeping the heart rate elevated the entire time as well!My main concern about trying this DVD was that it might be too easy for me, and that was definitely not the case--as noted above, Smith definitely keeps the energy up, and at least through the first two workouts.  For this reason, I think that this DVD is best suited to those who are experienced exercisers, NOT for beginners.  So, if you already working out and are looking to continue to keep active as you get older, this DVD just might fit the bill.",4,Nice workout options for aging intermediate exercisers,1332374400,"03

1460778,A3OXRFCJI67IMN,B005GYXNT0,Bold Consumer,"[1, 1]","Kathy Smith is always great. This DVD is no exception. I just finished it and I'm dripping with sweat.Here are some of the things I like about it the most.1. The moves include lots of lateral movement that I don't get when I work out on my exercise equipment.2. It pushes me to go a little harder than I do when I have options to go slower, less resistance, etc.3. The weight work in the circuit section is effective, smart, and time-effective as well. I automatically went for very, very light weights, but then after looking at her arms, I picked up the ones she recommended. Good choice!4. She even got me to do a couple of hops, and I don't do high-impact workouts. I don't do them because I have friends with messed up knees and I'm very protective of mine. I like the way she did it though, so I made an exception to my rule.5. The 'Balance' section was a fantastic CORE workout, waist work,  as well as being excellent for building strength standing on one leg, a little bit of a bounce here and there.All-in-all, I love the workout. I want to come back and add a little more after I've had more time on the final section, the total-energy segment which is supposed to help refresh, recharge, and de-stress my life. I have a meeting first, but then I'll need it.  :)I came back to do the total-energy segment and found that it wasn't as easy as I thought it was going to be. There were a few things in it that I had to work around.  I was thinking it would be some nice, easy stretches, but it was no picnic for me. That was my least favorite part of the three 20-minute sections.",5,Lateral Movement I Don't Get When I Work Out On My Exercise Machines,1332374400,"03 22, 2012",2012,1587,"['Kathy', 'Smith', 'always', 'great', 'DVD', 'exception', 'just', 'finished', ""'m"", 'dripping', 'are', 'things', 'like', 'most.1', 'moves', 'include', 'lots', 'lateral', 'movement', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'when', 'work', 'out', 'exercise', 'equipment.2', 'go', 'little', 'harder', 'do', 'when', 'have', 'options', 'go', 'slower', 'less', 'resistance', 'etc.3', 'weight', 'work', 'circuit', 'section', 'effective', 'smart', 'time-effective', 'as', 'well', 'automatically', 'went', 'very', 'very', 'light', 'weights', 'then', 'looking', 'arms', 'picked', 'up', 'ones', 'recommended', 'Good', 'choice', '4', 'even', 'got', 'do', 'couple', 'hops', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'high-impact', 'workouts', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'have', 'friends', 'messed', 'up', 'knees', ""'m"", 'very', 'protective', 'mine', 'way', 'did', 'made', 'exception', 'rule.5', ""'Balance"", 'section', 'was', 'fantastic', 'CORE', 'workout', 'waist', 'work', 'as', 'well', 'being', 'excellent', 'building', 'strength', 'standing', 'one', 'leg', 'little', 'bit', 'bounce', 'here', 'there.All-in-all', 'love', 'workout', 'want', 'come', 'back', 'add', 'little', 'more', ""'ve"", 'had', 'more', 'time', 'final', 'section', 'total-energy', 'segment', 'supposed', 'help', 'refresh', 'recharge', 'de-stress', 'life', 'have', 'meeting', 'first', 'then', ""'ll"", 'need', 'came', 'back', 'do', 'total-energy', 'segment', 'found', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'easy', 'thought', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'were', 'few', 'things', 'had', 'work', 'around', 'was', 'thinking', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'easy', 'stretches', 'was', 'picnic', 'was', 'least', 'favorite', 'part', 'three', '20-minute', 'sections']",AGELESS WITH KATHY SMITH: TOTAL BODY TURNAROUND
1460779,A3EP6YVAYS9YM3,B005GYXNT0,Book Worm,"[3, 3]","Kathy Smith's latest workout video includes 3, 20 minute workouts.  Kathy works out alone on a bright, cheerful set.  The music is a generic, rhythmic, non vocal type of exercise music.  It's not my favorite type of music to work out to, but it does keep the exerciser on pace to work up a sweat.Circuit Workout:  Kathy alternates 3 minute cardio segments with weight training.  There really isn't any type of warm up, and the cardio is basic without any complicated combos to learn.  For example, Kathy starts out with heel touches that lead into knee ups, and then repeater knee ups that build to a push of 16 repeaters on each leg.  All 3 cardio segments build to a push.  And there are even a few high impact moves like pop ups, which is simply jumping up in the air.  The weight segments work the upper body with dumbbells.  Kathy does lat rows, bicep curls, shoulder presses, one leg dead lifts, tricep extensions, and then she finishes with a set of regular and tricep pushups.  The lower body is worked with squats and lunges.  Just like the warm up, the cool down is short and includes just a few stretches to end the workout.Balance Workout:  In this workout Kathy alternates cardio movements with balancing exercises.  You'll definitely get your heart rate up.  The routine is also very basic and simple to follow.  I liked the flowing feel of this routine.  The intensity is increased by using flowing arm movements along with the foot work.  Two balancing exercise examples  include bringing one knee up while standing and then flexing the toes, as well as bringing one knee up and the opposite arm down to meet while you are standing on one leg.  The moves are deceptively simple but challenging nevertheless.  The routine ends with a series of standing yoga stretches.Energize:  This workout is a series of athletic, yoga and pilates type of stretches.  Kathy starts out standing.  Then, she gets on hands and knees, sits, then lays down on the mat.  By the end of this workout, I felt like I had stretched every muscle in my body.Overall, this is a good workout DVD.  Because of the pace and some of the challenging moves, I do think this DVD is best suited for an intermediate to advanced exerciser.  I like the fact that all these workouts won't take long.  I just wish the workout had a more inspiring music soundtrack.  I also prefer a little more variety for my cardio dance segments.  For that reason I am not giving this DVD 5 stars.  But if you are a Kathy Smith fan, who does not like complicated or dancy moves, and are at least an intermediate level exerciser, I say give this one a try.",4,"Simple to Follow, For The Int. To Adv.

1460780,A3AHDR4F2J7YXX,B005GYXNT0,"Caliaha ""Caliaha""","[2, 2]","I LOVE this video. I have been a fan of Kathy Smith over the years and some of her videos I adore and others aren't my favorites. This is definitely one of my very favorites. It is a beautiful set with various ""charkra"" colored large glass vases spread throughout. The music is upbeat, but not obnoxious and not too loud. I do however miss her entourage of students that she usually practices with (she practices alone in this one). Kathy is totally amazing at age 59 in this video; she looks better than most 30-40 year old's.The video is broken into 3 sections that can be practiced separately or combined in any order you like. I prefer a slightly different order than they have listed on the video menu. I've put number next to each one for my preferred practice order:Total Circuit (2)Total Balance (1)Total Energy (3)TOTAL CIRCUITIn 24 minute segment Kathy switches between lite cardo and lite weights. Very little instruction is provided, but she's quite easy to visually follow along. The first couple cardio movements are a bit difficult for me since it involved a fair amount of twisting action and I have some hip issues at the moment. The weight segments included bent over rows, bicep curls, overhead press, dead lift, and tricep kick-backs (light-weights with high-repitition). For both the cardo and weights Kathy performs very effective repetitions with full movements, repeaters (quick movements in shorter range of motion, they full movements. This section works your muscles  and full overall body really well in a short amount of time.TOTAL BALANCEThis section is a mix of swinging and fun dance-like movements mixed with balancing. It feels like a vinyasa yoga class without the boring old sun salutes :-) For example you start by moving side-to-side, then forward-back and includes arm swings. Then on to lunges with challenging (but not too challenging) 1-leg balance movements. I love this section; it makes me feel alive and happy!TOTAL ENERGYBeth's Cholette's review on this video is very helpful, but unlike her take on this section, I LOVE IT..it is one of my very favorites. I use it as a morning energizing and awakening ritual and in only 20 minutes so you can fit it into your day just by getting up a bit earlier than usual. It starts out with astanding breathing and movement section, then moves on to the floor. It includes stretching and more movement/breathing. I really like the cat/cow/cobra section with lots of movement to lubricate and open your joints and muscles. It ends with more standing movements and I especially like the shoulder blade series. I feel energized, centered and renewed after this practice.My only concern is with the video quality. The definition/resolution, sound, and staging is excellent, but for some reason the ""frames per minute"" seems off. It is a bit choppy and even makes me a bit dizzy at times. Not a huge deal, perhaps this is done to reduce digital file size.Amazon has this at 1/2 price right now, $8 is a great value for this video that you can use over and over again.Please check out my other video yoga and exercise reviews on Amazon.

Let's just say as you (I) grow older, the way you (I) exercise needs to change - not because of laziness or tiredness (although you (I) could argue those points at certain times) but because of the natural aging process, regardless of one's past exercise habits. The objective of this program by fitness veteran Kathy Smith is emphasis on movement, balance, and toning - good for people of all ages, regardless of any other fitness activity a person may (or may not) be doing.Three workouts are included, each around 20 minutes, with segments on balance and toning of legs, arms, and butt, along with some core exercises. The only equipment necessary is a set of weights and maybe a mat if you don't have a carpet.I like Kathy's enthusiasm for fitness and her personality which I find more nurturing than drill sergeant-esque (a popular M.O. for fitness instructors these days). Also, she provides exercise modifications based upon fitness levels. You can work up to more difficult exercises over time without feeling like you have to give up on the first go around.I can recommend any instructional video by Kathy Smith.

1460782,A2AYJJAFNSGSU1,B005GYXNT0,C. Bennett,"[0, 0]","I have been working out with Kathy Smith for decades (boy that makes me feel old to say that!). I did Step with her in the 80's, Pilates and weights in the 90's, and her Pregnancy workout in 2000. Now over 60, Kathy is still pushing us all to keep fit at any age.This DVD will be a warm welcome for veterans of Kathy's workouts. The first 20 minute segment is a Circuit workout, consisting of three minutes of cardio alternating with two minutes of weights. The cardio moves are familiar V-steps, knee lifts, and step touches. The weight work uses light weights (which you can double up if you'd like), and is familiar moves that focus on form. The weight exercises are bicep curls, tricep kickbacks and dead lifts. Just like her Lift Weights to Lose Weight series, you do a series of repetitions, and then do small pulses. The segment begins with a warm-up and ends with a cool-down stretch. You will need weights, a chair, and a mat or carpet for this segment.The second segment is billed as Balance, but it is truly lower body and core work. There are a lot of angled leg lifts, squats and lunges. There is ballet work and also Pilates work that focuses on form and technique. This segment is performed barefoot.The final segment was my favorite, the Energy segment. This is a Yoga segment, performed on a mat or carpet. Again, this segment is performed barefoot. There are stretches, twists, and cross over work. She asks you to think about your breath and focus on your body in this moment. I felt refreshed and relaxed after this segment. It's a good ""I need a break!"" segment.One of Kathy's core principles over the years has been Functional Fitness, fitness for ""doing life."" I really like how she asks us to move in ways we use in our daily lives, like picking things up off the floor.The DVD is set in a loft-style space. There are leveled risers with colored glass vases and pitchers. The floor is bare, painted concrete, which is cracked.The biggest dislike I had with this workout was Kathy's wardrobe. I really disliked what they chose for her. The high camera angles were looking straight down her spaghetti-strapped top (which is on the cover of the DVD). The pants also pulled at bad angles during each segment, leaving not a whole lot to the imagination. I did not feel that the wardrobe was in good taste. I think this is the first time a wardrobe has ever stood out to me in a fitness DVD.Included in the DVD are two Bonus segments - an upper body weight workout (that Kathy is not in), and a Yoga for Beginners segment (again, no Kathy).Overall, I really enjoyed this workout and will be looking forward to working out with it again.

1460783,A17V9XL4CWTQ6G,B005GYXNT0,Chandler,"[0, 0]","have reviewed hundreds of workout videos in the last few years as I enjoy a great workout library with a variety of videos to motivate me with choices. I have reviewed many of Kathy Smith's videos in the past as well and, in all honesty, out of all of the above this one is one of my new favorites.You will work out every muscle and you'll do it in the method most proven to work...and work better: You bring your heart rate up in cardio, then switch to some weights, and back again. Why? Cardio burns more calories during the workout and strength training builds muscle which burns more calories even at rest and continues burning calories long after you stop your workout.The cueing in here and the instruction is the kind that could be a lesson for any workout instructor...she keeps you moving but you still know how to do everything in correct form and you know what's coming up next by cueing during your reps. This means no matter how clumsy you are you never trip over yourself or stop moving. She is warm but not silly, she is high energy but not annoying.The workouts are only 20 minutes so you also have no excuse not to do them. It combines everything...a bit of yoga and stretching to lengthen your muscles so you don't bulk up as you build muscle, some strength training, and some cardio. For the strength training all you need are dumb bells. She uses a light set and a heavy set (5 lbs each and 8 lbs each) I just use one set. ( I like 7 lbs each)There are 3 routines: the strength and cardio, the balance and cardio, and an energy and yoga and stretching...very complete.If you are starting out you can still do this workout...she gives you tips to adjust and she tells you you can do moves without the dumbbells. You also build muscles in your lower body by using your own body weight in moves.This means you burn fat, and tone your core, upper body, and lower body...in 20 minutes and you don't ever feel like stopping because it's actually an exciting workout.Better yet, there is a balance workout as well which is rare in many DVDs--especially important in aging, but unlike wii fit THIS balance workout also has cardio when you do the balance routine..so you develop balance while scorching the calories OR you choose the sculpting and cardio workout.I actually ENJOYED the workout and I can't say that about many of them that I force myself to do. And THAT will make a person keep doing it.The setting is in a wide open, artsy urban loft and the music is very upbeat but the typical electronica of a workout video music backtrack.It's simply well done...I will use this one often...for really fast results combine 2 workouts for a 40 minute routine...use the 20 minute routine on days with less time or even everyday if you find it hard to make time to workout. You will still see results because it truly gets your heart rate up, then allows it to have a rest with the strength training.Did you know you actually burn MORE calories if you make your heart rate go up and down? It's like if you speed at the same high speed you actually burn less gas in your car than if you vary the speed up and down and up and down the whole trip.Burn more calories...build muscle...in little time.

The workouts are not 'super easy', you will feel a little sore at first, but you will also feel and see results which is what it's all about. I felt healthier and had more energy after the first week of doing the workouts three days a week. As always, the viewer is warned to check with their doctor first to make sure they are healthy enough to start a workout program and don't have any hidden health issues. I like Kathy Smith because she works hard to see that her routines not only get results, but are 'safe'. Some workout videos can injure someone.

The exercises are also meant to target problem spots, firm and tone, and increase flexibility.  The cool thing about this is you can break up the routine into 20 minute segments and recuperate before you get into the next routine. When starting out this can be helpful because there is nothing worse than complete physical exhaustion when starting out because it can lead to failure. I think this approach is more positive as well as encouraging. It will payoff if you stick with it and make a huge difference in terms of weight loss, firming up, and general overall fitness.When I started my current workout routine, I had a personal trainer who did pretty much the same thing that Kathy Smith does in ths DVD.

On Monday, my 4-year-old asked why I had ""fairy wings"" under my arms. Sigh. I grabbed the Ageless with Kathy Smith DVD and tried Total Body Turnaround that night. Pleasantly, there is just one fit woman in yoga clothes in a calm studio and the music is soothing without a trace of a beachy funk jam. Kathy Smith keeps it simple and her encouragement doesn't veer into annoyingly peppy quips. The 60-minute workout is divided into three sections of 20 minutes each and they are low-impact, easy workouts for beginners (and post-baby bodies like mine). It isn't hard to find 20 minutes, especially since the kids like doing the workout with me. I especially love the last 20-minute section for energy. It is more like a meditative moment with movement than a workout, but it makes me feel stronger. I've only been using it for a week. So far, I feel more energetic, but I'm not sure my body has firmed up yet. I think this is a good starter DVD, but I might have to graduate to something more challenging at some point. I'll keep at it.

Smith blows through each exercise without any preamble -- which is great for those already used to the workout -- but there's never any time to check form and technique.  Of course, a 20 minute workout must be efficient, and this one is since you move for the entire time.  While even the total body circuit isn't a kick-butt workout, it is definitely high-energy with good, toning results.  That said, it is probably too fast moving and strenuous for someone who is very overweight and/or out of shape.The workout gets the job done, even if it gets a little boring.  Smith isn't all that great at motivation, so if you're the type who needs a push to finish, you may not.  I much prefer the high-energy workouts of Jillian Michaels, who uses a similar interval approach as Smith does in the first workout but who makes you feel like you don't want to stop, no matter how much wind you are sucking.I like that Smith's workout contains three separate options that can be tackled separately or one after the other.  The option to ""play all"" is especially welcome since most workout DVDs make you reach for the remote to get to the next.  I also like how Smith's video recognizes the importance of balance in keeping yourself fit and healthy.For better balance/yoga type workouts, trySelf - Slim and Sleek Fast; this workout is low-impact and better for those starting out.  For better instruction, fat burn, and motivation during tough stretches, tryJillian Michaels - 30 Day Shred.

I appreciate that it is broken down into three 15-min. segments, so I can fit one segment in anytime.

1460792,A2VZP50FSYD6CO,B005GYXNT0,drebbles,"[1, 1]","""Total Body Turn Around"" with Kathy Smith features three different 20 minute workouts that target a physical change people face as they grow olderTotal Circuit:You need a mat, chair, and hand weights for this exercise which features interval training.  Smith incorporates a lot of aerobic work in this one - march in place; heel digs; side steps (eventually adding jumps); knee lifts; squats; and push ups.  The exercises using hand weights include putting one hand on a chair while lifting weights with the other hand; bicep curls; shoulder press; one leg dead lift; triceps extensions; and more.  This was a very difficult workout for me to do - I'd say it was for advanced exercisers.  Also, I didn't quite have enough room for all the equipment I needed.  It's an intense workout - a bit too intense for me.Total Balance:This exercise segment starts energetically right away with sidesteps and lots of arm movements.  Smith is in bare feet and I prefer doing this segment the same way.  The balancing part starts very quickly - Smith does a good job of smoothly incorporating the balancing with the aerobics.  Among the many moves she does are squats; grapevine; lifting the leg after sidesteps; plie squats; knee lifts; double squats; and some yoga positions.  While I did occasionally have some problems balancing (I exercise in my bedroom so I grabbed onto my bed for balance) I found this to be a very effective routine.  Of the three segments on this DVD Total Balance is the one I'll do the most.  My one complaint is that Smith is a little too enthusiastic and needs to tone down her ""whooping"".Total Energy:This exercise routine is done barefoot using a mat.  It is the slowest paced of the three.  There is a lot of emphasis on breathing and stretching.  Smith uses a lot of yoga poses in this one: chair pose; rag doll pose; child's pose etc. There are also some toning poses like rib circles; leg circles; rollup and down like a ball.  It is a nice leisurely workout that focuses on every part of your body by the time it is over.  It wasn't my favorite routine in this DVD - it is a bit too slow and I didn't feel like I had even exercised by the time it was done.  Still, I do like the concept of shooting energy through my hands - I've taken to doing that move during a long tiring workday.Bottom-line:""Total Body Turn Around"" offers a bit of something for everyone.  Kathy Smith has a lot of energy for her age (she really does need to tone down the whooping).  She offers lots of modifications for each move which is good for those of us who aren't as flexible or as athletic as she is. In the end I prefer Leslie Sansone's DVDs and I'll probably only pop this one in whenever I need to work on my balance.",4,A Little Something for Everyone,1337040000,"05 15, 2012",2012,2726,"['Total', 'Body', 'Turn', 'Around', 'Kathy', 'Smith', 'features', 'three', 'different', '20', 'minute', 'workouts', 'target', 'physical', 'change', 'people', 'face', 'grow', 'olderTotal', 'Circuit', 'need', 'mat', 'chair', 'hand', 'weights', 'exercise', 'interval', 'training', 'Smith', 'lot', 'aerobic', 'work', 'one', 'march', 'place', 'heel', 'digs', 'side', 'steps', 'eventually', 'adding', 'jumps', 'knee', 'lifts', 'squats', 'push', 'ups', 'exercises', 'using', 'hand', 'weights', 'include', 'putting', 'one', 'hand', 'chair', 'lifting', 'weights', 'other', 'hand', 'curls', 'shoulder', 'press', 'one', 'leg', 'dead', 'lift', 'extensions', 'more', 'was', 'very', 'difficult', 'workout', 'do', ""'d"", 'say', 'was', 'advanced', 'exercisers', 'Also', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'have', 'enough', 'room', 'equipment', 'needed', 'intense', 'workout', 'bit', 'too', 'intense', 'me.Total', 'Balance', 'exercise', 'segment', 'energetically', 'right', 'away', 'sidesteps', 'lots', 'arm', 'movements', 'Smith', 'bare', 'feet', 'prefer', 'doing', 'segment', 'same', 'way', 'balancing', 'part', 'very', 'quickly', 'Smith', 'good', 'job', 'smoothly', 'incorporating', 'balancing', 'aerobics', 'many', 'moves', 'are', 'squats', 'grapevine', 'lifting', 'leg', 'sidesteps', 'squats', 'knee', 'lifts', 'double', 'squats', 'yoga', 'positions', 'did', 'occasionally', 'have', 'problems', 'balancing', 'exercise', 'bedroom', 'so', 'grabbed', 'bed', 'balance', 'found', 'be', 'very', 'effective', 'routine', 'three', 'segments', 'DVD', 'Total', 'Balance', 'one', ""'ll"", 'do', 'most', 'one', 'complaint', 'Smith', 'little', 'too', 'enthusiastic', 'tone', 'down', 'whooping', '.Total', 'Energy', 'exercise', 'routine', 'done', 'barefoot', 'using', 'mat', 'slowest', 'paced', 'three', 'lot', 'emphasis', 'breathing', 'stretching', 'Smith', 'lot', 'yoga', 'poses', 'one', 'chair', 'pose', 'rag', 'doll', 'pose', 'child', 'pose', 'etc', 'are', 'also', 'toning', 'poses', 'rib', 'circles', 'circles', 'rollup', 'down', 'ball', 'nice', 'leisurely', 'part', 'body', 'time', 'was', ""n't"", 'favorite', 'routine', 'DVD', 'bit', 'too', 'slow', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'had', 'even', 'exercised', 'time', 'was', 'done', 'Still', 'do', 'concept', 'shooting', 'energy', 'hands', ""'ve"", 'taken', 'doing', 'move', 'long', 'tiring', 'workday.Bottom-line', 'Total', 'Body', 'Turn', 'Around', 'bit', 'something', 'everyone', 'Kathy', 'Smith', 'lot', 'energy', 'age', 'really', 'need', 'tone', 'down', 'whooping', 'lots', 'modifications', 'move', 'good', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'flexible', 'as', 'athletic', 'end', 'prefer', 'Leslie', 'Sansone', 'DVDs', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'only', 'pop', 'one', 'whenever', 'need', 'work', 'balance']",AGELESS WITH KATHY SMITH: TOTAL BODY TURNAROUND

Kathy is in her early 60s and still doing full-plank push-ups! (I modified those.)  The aerobic exercises seemed relatively low impact.  The upper arm and leg exercises (with weights) were intense and it was during these that I wished Kathy would have given more guidance on proper form.The Total Balance workout I did on another day after first doing cardio workouts from other DVDs.  I really liked this balance workout.  Kathy is in a very happy, upbeat, little-bit-silly mood and it's quite fun.  There's a difficult plie section that seemed torturously long, but otherwise I found this workout quite manageable.  It ends with some relaxing yoga positions.My favorite workout on the DVD is the Total Energy workout.  This is a very unique, 5-star workout in my opinion.  I did this after first doing an intense cardio workout.  Compared to the cardio I had just finished doing, this Total Energy workout felt like a very personal training session.  It's one of the most relaxing exercise sessions I've ever done - which might seem odd for a segment that's called ""Total Energy,"" but after doing it, I felt so relaxed, at peace with my body, and energized for the rest of my day's activities. This is a workout that I will use for an afternoon pick-me-up or when I feel crummy and am not up to more vigorous exercise.Kathy does incorporate quite a few yoga positions and twisting stretches into her workouts, so I wouldn't recommend these for someone with back or neck problems, but then, that is true of most workouts.",4,A Review I'll Revisit,1332201600,"03 20, 2012",2012,1626,"['20-min', 'circuit', 'segment', 'was', 'easy', 'follow', 'exercises', 'quite', 'challenging', 'execute', 'Kathy', 'early', '60s', 'still', 'doing', 'full-plank', 'push-ups', 'modified', 'aerobic', 'exercises', 'seemed', 'relatively', 'low', 'impact', 'upper', 'arm', 'leg', 'exercises', 'weights', 'were', 'intense', 'was', 'wished', 'Kathy', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'more', 'guidance', 'form.The', 'Total', 'Balance', 'workout', 'did', 'day', 'first', 'doing', 'cardio', 'workouts', 'other', 'DVDs', 'really', 'liked', 'balance', 'workout', 'Kathy', 'very', 'happy', 'upbeat', 'little-bit-silly', 'mood', 'quite', 'fun', 'difficult', 'plie', 'section', 'seemed', 'torturously', 'long', 'otherwise', 'found', 'workout', 'quite', 'manageable', 'relaxing', 'yoga', 'positions.My', 'favorite', 'workout', 'DVD', 'Total', 'Energy', 'workout', 'very', 'unique', '5-star', 'workout', 'opinion', 'did', 'first', 'doing', 'intense', 'cardio', 'workout', 'Compared', 'cardio', 'had', 'just', 'finished', 'doing', 'Total', 'Energy', 'felt', 'very', 'personal', 'training', 'session', 'one', 'most', 'relaxing', 'exercise', 'sessions', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'done', 'might', 'seem', 'odd', 'segment', 'called', 'Total', 'Energy', 'doing', 'felt', 'so', 'relaxed', 'peace', 'body', 'energized', 'rest', 'day', 'activities', 'workout', 'will', 'use', 'afternoon', 'pick-me-up', 'when', 'feel', 'crummy', 'am', 'not', 'more', 'vigorous', 'exercise.Kathy', 'incorporate', 'quite', 'few', 'yoga', 'positions', 'twisting', 'stretches', 'workouts', 'would', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'someone', 'back', 'neck', 'problems', 'then', 'true', 'most', 'workouts']",AGELESS WITH KATHY SMITH: TOTAL BODY TURNAROUND

I made a backup copy and still wound up wearing out both copies of the tape.  Why?  Because Kathy Smith is different from other fitness instructors.  She's happy.  She's not bossy.  She will never accuse you of phoning it in to the gym.  She keeps the moves simple, but they work.  She gives you a total body workout, whether it's aerobic or resistance training.  She's so chippy she makes that trainer with the last name located in Texas seem depressing.  She's a statuesque blonde with a bombshell body, but you feel like you're exercising with your most cheerful friend.  Sexy, charming, and a sense of humor.Her screen presence hasn't diminished over the years.  She looks right straight into the camera, and in this video, you feel like she's speaking to you alone.  That's right.  She is your personal trainer.There are three workouts:  1) circuit training - switching back and forth between aerobic and weight-lifting components; 2) balance training - aerobic moves combined with balance and strength moves; and 3) energize training - stretching and training muscles using body weight.  You can do any one, two, or all three.  No matter if you do any one, or two, or all three.  Each workout addresses the whole body from head to toe.This video is Kathy, and Kathy alone.  You should watch it first.  She's great at explaining the moves, but she is not constantly explaining them.  She's very uninhibited in this video, and she'll say to do this move and then chat a bit while doing it.  Or squeal (she's always done that).  Or giggle for no apparent reason (new to me, but not a problem).  Don't think, though, that this is called ""Ageless"" because she's getting on in years, like me.  These are not chair exercises.  They're challenging because working every body part and doing it well in twenty minutes means you gotta move!  That's the ageless part.  She says in the interview that she sees people ""stop participating"" because they're busy and/or getting older and think they don't have the time or the ability to do the activities they've enjoyed in the past.  I've seen it, too, and it can happen as early as college.When she was in her 70s, my grandmother borrowed my bike.  I just about had a cow; I was certain she'd fall off.  But she could ride circles around me, and I thought, I wanna be like Grandma!  You can do it.

1460804,A1ER5AYS3FQ9O3,B005GYXNT0,"K. Corn ""reviewer""","[3, 3]","While I like to stay fit, I am not an elite athlete but certainly try to exercise as often as possible. Just for the heck of it, I also had a friend complete this workout with me a few times as one of us exercises far more than the other We both found it challenging without being too intense, although we agreed that beginners may need to build up to the full workout.If you don't want to spend a small fortune on exercise equipment, you may be relieved to know that you can get by with some weights and a mat. However, if you are looking for an exercise routine that is low impact you may find that you have difficulty with some of the lunges and squats.There are several options to choose. On a good day, I complete all three - the Total Circuit, Total Balance, and Total Energy sections. However, it is certainly not necessary to do all of them at once- or even in the same day. The Total Circuit section is my favorite as it includes a combination of cardio and weight exercises that I particularly like. Hops, lunges, and more keep the heart rate up.Then there are plenty of bicep curls and overhead presses to tighten the muscles and tone the upper body. I actually had sore muscles the first few times I completed this section. That went away fairly quickly and I did notice an improvement in my muscle tone - a definite motivation to keep using this DVD! If you are a beginner, expect this section to be challenging. But hang in there and you're likely to find it rewarding - in time.My foot was severely injured when I was younger. It has improved significantly since then but I was worried about the Total Balance section. Happily, I could manage to keep from falling or losing my balance even when I was instructed to perform exercises which included balancing with one knee up. Stretches were also included, first done on one side and then the other.The easiest section for me was the one focusing on Total Energy. I was a bit baffled about why this would be called Total Energy as it seemed to be more about stretching than energy. I have to admit that even though I found this part of the DVD the least challenging my flexibility has increased and early morning joint pain is completely gone so ""easy"" does not mean ineffective.",5,Perfect for those wanting a very effective workout,1337126400,"05 16, 2012",2012,2243,"['like', 'stay', 'fit', 'am', 'not', 'elite', 'athlete', 'certainly', 'try', 'exercise', 'as', 'often', 'possible', 'Just', 'heck', 'also', 'had', 'friend', 'complete', 'workout', 'few', 'times', 'one', 'far', 'more', 'other', 'found', 'challenging', 'being', 'too', 'intense', 'agreed', 'beginners', 'may', 'need', 'build', 'up', 'full', 'workout.If', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'spend', 'small', 'fortune', 'exercise', 'equipment', 'may', 'be', 'relieved', 'know', 'can', 'get', 'weights', 'mat', 'However', 'are', 'looking', 'exercise', 'routine', 'low', 'impact', 'may', 'find', 'have', 'difficulty', 'lunges', 'squats.There', 'are', 'several', 'options', 'choose', 'good', 'day', 'complete', 'three', 'Total', 'Circuit', 'Total', 'Balance', 'Total', 'Energy', 'sections', 'However', 'certainly', 'not', 'necessary', 'do', 'once-', 'even', 'same', 'day', 'Total', 'Circuit', 'section', 'favorite', 'combination', 'cardio', 'weight', 'exercises', 'particularly', 'Hops', 'more', 'keep', 'heart', 'rate', 'are', 'plenty', 'bicep', 'curls', 'overhead', 'presses', 'tighten', 'muscles', 'tone', 'upper', 'body', 'actually', 'had', 'sore', 'muscles', 'first', 'few', 'times', 'completed', 'section', 'went', 'away', 'fairly', 'quickly', 'did', 'notice', 'improvement', 'muscle', 'tone', 'definite', 'motivation', 'keep', 'using', 'DVD', 'are', 'beginner', 'expect', 'section', 'be', 'challenging', 'hang', 'there', ""'re"", 'likely', 'find', 'rewarding', 'time.My', 'foot', 'was', 'severely', 'injured', 'when', 'was', 'younger', 'improved', 'significantly', 'then', 'was', 'worried', 'Total', 'Balance', 'section', 'Happily', 'could', 'manage', 'keep', 'falling', 'losing', 'balance', 'even', 'when', 'was', 'instructed', 'perform', 'exercises', 'included', 'balancing', 'one', 'knee', 'up', 'Stretches', 'were', 'also', 'included', 'first', 'done', 'one', 'side', 'then', 'other.The', 'easiest', 'section', 'was', 'one', 'focusing', 'Total', 'Energy', 'was', 'bit', 'baffled', 'about', 'why', 'would', 'be', 'called', 'Total', 'Energy', 'seemed', 'be', 'more', 'stretching', 'energy', 'have', 'admit', 'even', 'found', 'part', 'DVD', 'least', 'challenging', 'flexibility', 'increased', 'early', 'morning', 'joint', 'pain', 'completely', 'gone', 'so', 'easy', 'not', 'mean', 'ineffective']",AGELESS WITH KATHY SMITH: TOTAL BODY TURNAROUND
1460805,A2RKI7RPP5CJMG,B005GYXNT0,"K. Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!""","[2, 3]","""Ageless With Kathy Smith:  Total Body Turnaround"" is really an excellent collection of workouts for experienced excercisers looking for a quick workout to start off the day or for the older population (which this video is actually geared toward) who still want to workout, but can't move or last as long as they used to.The DVD comes with three workouts, each one focusing on different aspects of an older person's health and exercise goals.  The Total Circuit workout runs just over twenty minutes and combines cardio and light weight training for an all around general workout.  The Total Balance workout focuses more on cardio and balance (obviously) work and is actually my favorite of the three workouts.  It's also the favorite of my parents, who say their balance has improved since doing this routine.  The third workout is called Total Energy and focuses not so much on wearing you out, but energizing the body through yoga and light aerobics.As a four-time (and counting) Insanity alum, I found all three of these workout routines to be a bit light.  However, I'm not the target audience here, and I do believe that for folks over the age of forty who might not be as active as they would like to be, this is an excellent video to pick up.My primary complaints with this DVD are that it is A) boring due to lackluster music and false entusiasm via Kathy Smith and B) poorly instructed.  For older generations or for folks who aren't used to working out, some of Smith's brief explanations of how to properly do each mover can be confusing or just inadequate.  In all honesty, Shaun T's instruction of moves in the Insanity program and Jillian Michael's explanation of moves in her DVDs is much better.Also included are a couple of excercise routines from other DVDs in the series, and they are decent enough on their own.  I was especially fond of the yoga routine.",3,"The Workouts Are Okay, The Instruction Is....",1348444800,"09 24, 2012",2012,1876,"['Ageless', 'Kathy', 'Smith', 'Total', 'Body', 'Turnaround', 'really', 'excellent', 'collection', 'workouts', 'experienced', 'excercisers', 'looking', 'quick', 'workout', 'start', 'off', 'day', 'older', 'population', 'video', 'actually', 'geared', 'who', 'still', 'want', 'workout', 'ca', ""n't"", 'move', 'last', 'as', 'long', 'used', 'to.The', 'DVD', 'three', 'workouts', 'one', 'focusing', 'different', 'aspects', 'older', 'person', 'health', 'exercise', 'goals', 'Total', 'Circuit', 'workout', 'just', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'combines', 'cardio', 'light', 'weight', 'training', 'general', 'workout', 'Total', 'Balance', 'workout', 'more', 'cardio', 'balance', 'obviously', 'work', 'actually', 'favorite', 'three', 'workouts', 'also', 'favorite', 'parents', 'who', 'say', 'balance', 'improved', 'doing', 'routine', 'third', 'workout', 'called', 'Total', 'Energy', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'wearing', 'energizing', 'body', 'yoga', 'light', 'aerobics.As', 'four-time', 'counting', 'Insanity', 'alum', 'found', 'three', 'workout', 'routines', 'be', 'bit', 'light', 'However', ""'m"", 'not', 'target', 'audience', 'here', 'do', 'believe', 'folks', 'age', 'forty', 'who', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'as', 'active', 'would', 'like', 'be', 'excellent', 'video', 'pick', 'up.My', 'primary', 'complaints', 'DVD', 'are', 'boring', 'due', 'lackluster', 'music', 'false', 'entusiasm', 'Kathy', 'Smith', 'B', 'poorly', 'instructed', 'older', 'generations', 'folks', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'used', 'working', 'out', 'Smith', 'brief', 'explanations', 'how', 'properly', 'do', 'mover', 'can', 'be', 'confusing', 'just', 'inadequate', 'honesty', 'Shaun', 'T', 'instruction', 'moves', 'Insanity', 'program', 'Jillian', 'Michael', 'explanation', 'moves', 'DVDs', 'much', 'better.Also', 'included', 'are', 'couple', 'excercise', 'routines', 'other', 'DVDs', 'series', 'are', 'decent', 'enough', 'own', 'was', 'especially', 'fond', 'yoga', 'routine']",AGELESS WITH KATHY SMITH: TOTAL BODY TURNAROUND
1460806,A1EVV74UQYVKRY,B005GYXNT0,K. Groh,"[0, 0]","Kathy Smith's Total Body Turnaround has three 20 minute 'workouts'. I put that in quotes because they aren't really aerobic workouts in the traditional sense. The first one is a circuit training video, a few minutes of moderate aerobic activities (you can determine how much pop you want to put into it) combined with a few minutes of weight toning (you can use proper weights or whatever you want - water bottles, soup cans, whatever gives you the weight you need in your hands). This section is the most vigorous but in comparison to other workout videos, is relatively easy. But, it's all relative to your body condition and abilities. I can't do the Zumba videos but I can do a step aerobic workout so this was not a problem.The second set is some movement combined with balance. Kathy does a few side steps or 'grapevines' and then stops to go to a balance position. This works your core and again, isn't hard to keep up with but as with any workout, the effort you put in is proportional to the benefit you gain.The third section is stretching and flexibility. I really enjoyed this. Not because it was slower moving but because I don't stretch enough and I found areas that I was sadly lacking in flexibility. This is the peaceful wind down of the whole video and ends it on a really nice note.You can complete one set or all three, whatever fits in your schedule.Things I liked about this video:* Kathy is easy to follow, gives clear directions and keeps it simple.* It is not intimidating like some workout videos, it's just Kathy and a pleasant set.* It is easy to just turn on and start, no big intro that you have to go through to start the workout.* Two of the sets can be done barefoot - my favorite way to workout.Things I didn't like:* Kathy is is phenomenal shape but her clothes are too tight in this video which annoyed me at times. It's petty but a small distraction.* Music is really important to me in a video, the music in this is just a constant background beat - nothing intrusive but also not as compelling as other videos.* A pet peeve of mine when working out is when the instructor doesn't keep time with the music. So even though this music not prominent, Kathy often changes speeds and isn't keeping time with the music, she's just moving to a different beat and sometimes that was a little too fast.Overall, I liked this video and will continue to use it. It is not the kind of workout that will make you 20 year-old buff but is great for an older gal who isn't currently in the best shape.",4,"Not too Hard, Not too Easy - Nicely produced",1334793600,"04 19, 2012",2012,2522,"['Kathy', 'Smith', 'Total', 'Body', 'Turnaround', 'three', '20', 'minute', ""'workouts"", 'put', 'quotes', 'are', ""n't"", 'really', 'aerobic', 'workouts', 'traditional', 'sense', 'first', 'one', 'circuit', 'training', 'video', 'few', 'minutes', 'moderate', 'aerobic', 'activities', 'can', 'determine', 'how', 'much', 'pop', 'want', 'put', 'combined', 'few', 'minutes', 'weight', 'toning', 'can', 'use', 'proper', 'weights', 'want', 'water', 'bottles', 'soup', 'cans', 'weight', 'need', 'hands', 'section', 'most', 'vigorous', 'comparison', 'other', 'workout', 'videos', 'relatively', 'easy', 'relative', 'body', 'condition', 'abilities', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'Zumba', 'videos', 'can', 'do', 'step', 'aerobic', 'workout', 'so', 'was', 'not', 'problem.The', 'second', 'set', 'movement', 'combined', 'balance', 'Kathy', 'few', 'side', 'steps', ""'grapevines"", 'then', 'stops', 'go', 'balance', 'position', 'core', 'again', ""n't"", 'hard', 'keep', 'up', 'workout', 'effort', 'put', 'proportional', 'benefit', 'gain.The', 'third', 'section', 'stretching', 'flexibility', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'Not', 'was', 'slower', 'moving', 'do', ""n't"", 'stretch', 'enough', 'found', 'areas', 'was', 'sadly', 'lacking', 'flexibility', 'peaceful', 'wind', 'whole', 'video', 'really', 'nice', 'note.You', 'can', 'complete', 'one', 'set', 'three', 'schedule.Things', 'liked', 'video', '*', 'Kathy', 'easy', 'follow', 'clear', 'directions', 'simple', '*', 'not', 'intimidating', 'workout', 'videos', 'just', 'Kathy', 'pleasant', 'set', '*', 'easy', 'just', 'turn', 'start', 'big', 'intro', 'have', 'go', 'start', 'workout', '*', 'Two', 'sets', 'can', 'be', 'done', 'barefoot', 'favorite', 'way', 'workout.Things', 'did', ""n't"", '*', 'Kathy', 'phenomenal', 'shape', 'clothes', 'are', 'too', 'tight', 'video', 'annoyed', 'times', 'petty', 'small', 'distraction', '*', 'Music', 'really', 'important', 'video', 'music', 'just', 'constant', 'background', 'beat', 'nothing', 'intrusive', 'also', 'not', 'as', 'compelling', 'other', 'videos', '*', 'pet', 'peeve', 'mine', 'when', 'working', 'out', 'when', 'instructor', ""n't"", 'keep', 'time', 'music', 'So', 'even', 'music', 'not', 'prominent', 'Kathy', 'often', 'speeds', ""n't"", 'keeping', 'time', 'music', 'just', 'moving', 'different', 'beat', 'sometimes', 'was', 'little', 'too', 'fast.Overall', 'liked', 'video', 'will', 'continue', 'use', 'not', 'kind', 'workout', 'will', 'make', '20', 'year-old', 'buff', 'great', 'older', 'gal', 'who', ""n't"", 'currently', 'best', 'shape']",AGELESS WITH KATHY SMITH: TOTAL BODY TURNAROUND
1460807,A1WKUY7T0EM0GM,B005GYXNT0,"Krystal James ""genie""","[0, 0]","Kathy Smith is still a very good at what she does: she gives clear instuction, has good energy, and gives you a fairly good workout.The downside: it's boring if you're one of those people who like variety in your workout. The moves are very simple and repetitive, which is good for people who want something that's easy to follow. For the rest of us, this makes a very long and dull 20 minutes.It doesn't really feel like you're getting 3 separate workouts. Feels more like 1 complete workout that was broken up into 3 parts with short warmups and what feels like insufficient stretching in between.The first part is the circuit workout, 3 minutes of cardio and 3 minutes of strength training in intervals. The strength training is basic but seems effective enough. The cardio sections are basically 3 sections low impact cardio consisting of one basic move for each section with a few different variations of that move. It'll work you out if you put the effort into it, but it was not very enjoyable. I found myself watching the clock wondering why it was taking so long. On the first strength exercise she recommends you use a chair, even though you can do the move without a chair, which she doesn't show you how to do until the second set.The second part is a series of basic low impact moves that will look familiar if you've ever done any of her other workouts alternating with balancing exercises. This isn't going to make a good cardio workout, but if you put effort into it, you can get a pretty good ballet-type conditioning exercise out of it.The third part is stretching and abs. Only a couple of the moves require modification, which she doesn't tell you how to do. The rest is light yoga and slow stretching. Which is a good way to end the first workout and to relax, and again, with some effort, you might feel like you could get some kind of yoga workout from this.I think if you're at a more advanced fitness level you're going to be disappointed.If you don't want to enjoy your workouts or you're not going to enjoy it anyway and just want something quick that could be fairly effective, this should work fine for you.

There is something for everyone, except easy, and a bit more motivation.I'm too out-of-shape to complete all three workouts.  Just 20 minutes at a time.There are 3 20-minute workouts, plus bonus materials.  You need a mat and weights of your choice.1. ""Total Circuit"" is 20 minutes of bold, but mainly low-impact.  This is the one with the weights.  Kathy takes you through traditional low-impact circuit step moves for 20 minutes, with relatively high tempo for the whole 20 minutes, and with brief changes for you to catch your breath.  The stepping is not complicated; I like that; just enough muscle confusion, but you can follow along; legs, buttocks, core...  The weight work is great; arms, back, shoulders...  I like how she alternates between step work and weights, back and forth.  The music is easy on the ears, but generic music, high-tempo.2. ""Total Balance"" is a compilation of balance and floor work; core and flexibility.  The balancing isn't easy.  I used a chair for support.  There is some floor work as well.  Good moves, but a tad difficult for me.  It's somewhat of a strength training as well as being mainly for balance.3. ""Total Energy"" is more floor work than anything, but difficult as well.  There is a lot of strength training involved in the moves.  You have to be pretty strong to pull off moves like that.Included in the bonus material are two tastes from current videos:4. ""Exhale Core Fusion: Lean and Toned requires upper-body muscle.  Just 10 minutes.5. ""Yoga for beginners"" looks good.  A lot of down Dogs are required, but otherwise doable.  Just 10 minutes.6.

1460809,A2SNRRXE9M9ZDY,B005GYXNT0,"Live2Cruise ""Live2Cruise""","[1, 1]","This is a 3-segment dvd consisting of circuit, balance, and energy workouts.  Each workout is meant to stand alone for busy days, or all three can be combined.  The setting is in a living-room-style studio with soft, bright light and lots of pastel colors.  To do the workout you need either a mat or carpeted surface, and dumbells (various weights are helpful, I believe Kathy ranges from 3 to 10 pounds in the dumbells she uses throughout the workout).  Kathy is an enthusiastic instructor with a very positive attitude.  She's encouraging, but not a drill sergeant.  I would say the difficulty level of the workout is intermediate; I work out regularly to Leslie Sansone dvds as well as some Biggest Loser workouts, and the first segment was a little tough for me.The first segment is 24 minutes of circuit training (cardio alternating with strength training, which focuses mostly on the arms and back), followed by stretching.  To me this was the most difficult and I could feel my heart rate getting up there pretty quickly.  Some of the cuing is confusing toward the beginning; sometimes there isn't enough of a warning before she's already doing the move, and sometimes the camera angle is funny so it's hard to tell what she's doing (for example, several times it focused on her upper body while she was doing lower body moves.)  I would have also appreciated more coaching on form, especially with the strength training--she went into dead lifts without any discussion of proper form.  The cardio portions, while fun and efficient, often felt chaotic due to insufficient cuing.The second segment is about 20 minutes and focuses on balance, with several moves that seem inspired by ballet.  Kathy keeps you moving in this segment with lots of fluid motion, so the heart rate stays up (although not as much as in the first segment) even while doing balance work.  The cuing in this segment was much improved from the first one.  This was a fun segment, and I could feel my muscles really working.  Another yoga-style stretch follows this segment.The final segment is also 20 minutes and focuses on ""energy.""  There are many moves from yoga and some pilates-inspired moves, that focus on strengthening, stretching, and loosening the joints for flexibility.  This segment was the least strenuous of the three, and for me it was both energizing and relaxing at the same time.  Kathy's cuing here was excellent.Overall I enjoyed the workout, found it challenging (especially the first segment) and felt it was a comprehensive approach to exercise targeting many important areas.  My whole body felt worked out and then nicely stretched by the time I had gone through all 3 segments.  My main complaint is the cuing in the first segment; I wish it had been as good as her cuing in the second and third.",4,Good intermediate full-body workout; cuing in first segment could be better,1335052800,"04 22, 2012",2012,2804,"['3-segment', 'dvd', 'consisting', 'circuit', 'balance', 'energy', 'workouts', 'workout', 'meant', 'stand', 'alone', 'busy', 'days', 'three', 'can', 'be', 'combined', 'setting', 'living-room-style', 'studio', 'soft', 'bright', 'light', 'lots', 'pastel', 'colors', 'do', 'workout', 'need', 'mat', 'carpeted', 'surface', 'dumbells', 'various', 'weights', 'are', 'helpful', 'believe', 'Kathy', 'ranges', '3', '10', 'pounds', 'dumbells', 'workout', 'Kathy', 'enthusiastic', 'instructor', 'very', 'positive', 'attitude', 'encouraging', 'not', 'drill', 'sergeant', 'would', 'say', 'difficulty', 'level', 'workout', 'intermediate', 'work', 'out', 'regularly', 'Leslie', 'Sansone', 'dvds', 'as', 'well', 'Biggest', 'Loser', 'workouts', 'first', 'segment', 'was', 'little', 'tough', 'me.The', 'first', 'segment', '24', 'minutes', 'circuit', 'training', 'cardio', 'alternating', 'strength', 'training', 'mostly', 'arms', 'back', 'followed', 'stretching', 'was', 'most', 'difficult', 'could', 'feel', 'heart', 'rate', 'getting', 'up', 'there', 'pretty', 'quickly', 'cuing', 'confusing', 'beginning', 'sometimes', ""n't"", 'enough', 'warning', 'already', 'doing', 'move', 'sometimes', 'camera', 'angle', 'funny', 'hard', 'tell', 'what', 'doing', 'example', 'several', 'times', 'focused', 'upper', 'body', 'was', 'doing', 'lower', 'body', 'moves', 'would', 'have', 'also', 'appreciated', 'more', 'coaching', 'form', 'especially', 'strength', 'training', 'went', 'dead', 'lifts', 'discussion', 'proper', 'form', 'cardio', 'portions', 'fun', 'efficient', 'often', 'felt', 'chaotic', 'due', 'insufficient', 'cuing.The', 'second', 'segment', '20', 'minutes', 'focuses', 'balance', 'several', 'moves', 'seem', 'inspired', 'ballet', 'Kathy', 'moving', 'segment', 'lots', 'fluid', 'motion', 'heart', 'rate', 'up', 'not', 'as', 'much', 'first', 'segment', 'even', 'doing', 'balance', 'work', 'cuing', 'segment', 'was', 'much', 'improved', 'first', 'one', 'was', 'fun', 'segment', 'could', 'feel', 'muscles', 'really', 'working', 'yoga-style', 'stretch', 'segment.The', 'final', 'segment', 'also', '20', 'minutes', 'focuses', 'energy', 'are', 'many', 'moves', 'yoga', 'pilates-inspired', 'moves', 'focus', 'strengthening', 'stretching', 'loosening', 'joints', 'flexibility', 'segment', 'was', 'least', 'strenuous', 'three', 'was', 'energizing', 'relaxing', 'same', 'time', 'Kathy', 'cuing', 'here', 'was', 'excellent.Overall', 'enjoyed', 'workout', 'found', 'challenging', 'especially', 'first', 'segment', 'felt', 'was', 'comprehensive', 'approach', 'exercise', 'targeting', 'many', 'important', 'areas', 'whole', 'body', 'felt', 'worked', 'out', 'then', 'nicely', 'stretched', 'time', 'had', 'gone', '3', 'segments', 'main', 'complaint', 'cuing', 'first', 'segment', 'wish', 'had', 'been', 'as', 'good', 'cuing', 'second', 'third']",AGELESS WITH KATHY SMITH: TOTAL BODY TURNAROUND
1460810,A28FJ93TJSSQS4,B005GYXNT0,LMS,"[0, 0]","While there is no magical fountain of youth (not even Botox!) it is well documented that exercise is the best tool we have to slow the aging process.  Specifically, aging causes a decrease in muscle mass which leads to decreases in energy and other metabolic problems.  Balance declines leading to an increased risk of falls.  In addition, flexibility also declines.  This dvd contains 3 short (20 minute) workouts that are each designed to target one of these problem areas.  This is a relatively good workout dvd with some minor issues.First, the target audience is probably the mid 40s to above crowd who are either beginners or beginner/intermediate.  If you run marathons or bike 40 miles for fun, don't get this workout - pick up a jari love or cathee dvd :)  This is really targeted to help people get into shape and have more energy.  The moves are relatively basic and should be easy to follow.  There were no dancey style moves that would take a while to learn, these are all basic moves that should require no learning curve (and I am a clutz and I had no problems!).The first workout is a weight/cardio workout.  She moves back and forth between cardio moves and basic strength training.  These exercises largely target the legs, arms, and chest.  The cardio work is mostly lower impact and should be relatively easy on the joints.  The strength training work targets most of the major muscle groups.The second workout is the balance section.  This involves some core work.  These were all good exercises that should, if practiced consistently, increase one's balance.  The third workout was a series of stretching/yoga exercises.The exercises chosen will effectively increase strength, energy, balance, and flexibility.  The workouts are short enough to not be intimidating and the moves are accessible to a beginner. Kathy Smith has been making workout videos for a long time and she knows what she is doing.  There were some sloppiness to the production (particularly the first workout).  In many places, she is looking at a different camera then what ended up in the final production.  It is a little disconcerting to have the instructor looking off in another direction.  Using more camera angles would have been helpful to show how a move was performed.  There were a couple of places where I wasn't exactly sure how the move was performed.  There were also a few quick transitions.  Since this is aimed at beginners, move attention to these details would have elevated this to a 5 star rating.  It is still a very good workout that is definitely worth considering.",4,The fountain of youth??????,1332979200,"03 29, 2012",2012,2583,"['magical', 'fountain', 'youth', 'not', 'even', 'Botox', 'well', 'documented', 'exercise', 'best', 'tool', 'have', 'slow', 'aging', 'process', 'Specifically', 'aging', 'decrease', 'muscle', 'mass', 'decreases', 'energy', 'other', 'metabolic', 'problems', 'Balance', 'leading', 'increased', 'risk', 'falls', 'addition', 'flexibility', 'also', 'dvd', '3', 'short', '20', 'minute', 'are', 'designed', 'target', 'one', 'problem', 'areas', 'relatively', 'good', 'workout', 'dvd', 'minor', 'issues.First', 'target', 'audience', 'probably', 'mid', '40s', 'above', 'crowd', 'who', 'are', 'beginners', 'beginner/intermediate', 'run', 'marathons', 'bike', '40', 'miles', 'fun', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'workout', 'pick', 'up', 'jari', 'love', 'cathee', 'dvd', 'really', 'targeted', 'help', 'people', 'get', 'shape', 'have', 'more', 'energy', 'moves', 'are', 'relatively', 'basic', 'should', 'be', 'easy', 'follow', 'were', 'dancey', 'style', 'moves', 'would', 'take', 'while', 'learn', 'are', 'basic', 'moves', 'should', 'require', 'learning', 'curve', 'am', 'clutz', 'had', 'problems', '.The', 'first', 'workout', 'weight/cardio', 'workout', 'back', 'forth', 'cardio', 'moves', 'basic', 'strength', 'training', 'exercises', 'largely', 'target', 'legs', 'arms', 'chest', 'cardio', 'work', 'mostly', 'lower', 'impact', 'should', 'be', 'relatively', 'easy', 'joints', 'strength', 'training', 'work', 'most', 'major', 'muscle', 'groups.The', 'second', 'workout', 'balance', 'section', 'core', 'work', 'were', 'good', 'exercises', 'should', 'practiced', 'consistently', 'increase', 'one', 'balance', 'third', 'workout', 'was', 'series', 'stretching/yoga', 'exercises.The', 'exercises', 'chosen', 'will', 'effectively', 'increase', 'strength', 'energy', 'balance', 'flexibility', 'workouts', 'are', 'short', 'enough', 'not', 'be', 'intimidating', 'moves', 'are', 'accessible', 'beginner', 'Kathy', 'Smith', 'been', 'making', 'workout', 'videos', 'long', 'time', 'what', 'doing', 'were', 'sloppiness', 'production', 'particularly', 'first', 'workout', 'many', 'places', 'looking', 'different', 'camera', 'then', 'what', 'ended', 'up', 'final', 'production', 'little', 'disconcerting', 'have', 'instructor', 'looking', 'off', 'direction', 'Using', 'more', 'camera', 'angles', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'helpful', 'show', 'how', 'move', 'was', 'performed', 'were', 'couple', 'places', 'where', 'was', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'sure', 'how', 'move', 'was', 'performed', 'were', 'also', 'few', 'quick', 'transitions', 'aimed', 'beginners', 'move', 'attention', 'details', 'would', 'have', 'elevated', '5', 'star', 'rating', 'still', 'very', 'good', 'workout', 'definitely', 'worth', 'considering']",AGELESS WITH KATHY SMITH: TOTAL BODY TURNAROUND
1460811,A2CZ98V784SRJ0,B005GYXNT0,L. Perry,"[1, 1]","I own a somewhat ridiculous amount of exercise DVDs (300+).  I own perhaps a half dozen of Kathy Smith's workouts.  I will say that of those six, this is my favorite.  I find her more calm and straightforward (while still being friendly and positive) in this one that in some of her others (she can seem a little hyper to me sometimes).I really, really LIKE this one!  I can't say that it's particularly challenging---whether it will give you results or not really will depend much on where you are now in your health journey.  I think for more intermediate exercisers this would be very good as a light day workout (or useful as 20 minute time crunch workouts).  OR, it would be WONDERFUL for new exercisers or those returning to exercise after a brief break or an illness (I'm the latter).  This is not suitable to advanced/extreme exercisers.What I like: Bright, modern friendly set.  Cheerful clear instruction.  Variety of exercises.  Good mix options.  Good camera angles that show the exercises.Kathy looks great...and inspires with her long term presence in fitness.

I usually don't get something near and dear to my heart as an exercise video through this reviewing program.  This is a workout I had considered getting, but had thought better of multiple times.  But, I kept coming back to it.  After trying it, I'm glad I got it for free because I won't be keeping it.This DVD offers 3 20-minute workout options. From the main menu, you can select Workout Options and that brings you to a submenu with choices for Play All, Total Circuit, Total Balance, or Total Energy. I wish that you were able to program the DVD and choose more than one option, but less than all three, but that is not an option.  You can choose Play All and then skip sections you don't want.In all of these workouts, Kathy exercises alone in a large area that I thought looked like a living room, or what was supposed to look like a living room.  I don't even remember the music and would have noticed if it was missing, so it apparently was not memorable and I don't remember it adding to the workout.  Kathy is one of the best, most experienced, most practial instructors around and that shows in her instruction, details that she points out about the moves, form pointers she gives, comments that display a total understanding of the home exerciser, options she gives for different levels of exercisers, etc.  She also can be rather hyper.  Her demeanor in these workouts was pretty calm for Kathy, although she did give some whoops I could live without.Here are some details about the workouts themselves:TOTAL CIRCUITIn this workout, Kathy alternates cardio segments and strength moves.  She gives recommendations for weights to use for the different segments and I found that useful.  She didn't give much time to pick up or put down the weights as she transitioned between segments.  I kept having to pause the workout to catch up.  Overall, I liked this workout because she accomplishes a lot in 20 minutes.TOTAL BALANCEThis is the kind of workout I SHOULD do, but don't really enjoy.  It is a flowing workout done barefoot that adds a cardio aspect to the balance work. Mostly, they are moves that have you do a move (like a lunge) and then come up to a balance move.TOTAL ENERGYThis is another barefoot section and sort of a yoga-ish, stretchy kind of workout that does a lot and not much of any one thing.  It felt good, but is the kind of workout I just won't come back to as other stretches/yoga workouts seem to flow better and which seem to have more of a point to it.I can see how the right exerciser would like this workout.  It's just not for me.",3,I really wanted to like this workout.

I found parts of this exercise DVD to be a tiny bit challenging, but doable. I was tired after completing the first two workouts, the Total Circuit & Total Balance. Kathy incorporates lunges, squats & hops into some of these routines. If you have knee problems or arthritis  in your feet, you might have difficulty with these movements.  She demonstrates easier, alternate moves for some of these exercises, but not all of them.Kathy Smith's Total Body Turnaround will move every joint in your body.The DVD centers on three separate 20 minute workouts each geared to a specific outcome.  It is easy to choose one or more workouts. I initially chose to do all three. The next time I will focus on the Total Circuit & Total Balance workouts.~Total Circuit~ alternates between light weights & aerobics to focus on fitness, calorie burning & cardio. You'll tone & strengthen your legs, buttocks, arms, & core while trimming your waistline. There are lunges, squats & some hopping in this exercise routine that might prove difficult if you have knee problems. For some of the exercises, not all, Kathy demonstrates alternat moves if you find a particular movement too difficult.~Total Balance~ focuses on strengthening muscle groups so we can maintain our balance as we age.  Balance exercises are often ignored in most exercise programs. I appreciate that they're included in this DVD. Kathy explains that as we age & begin losing our balance that our world becomes smaller. We might not want to go hiking because we might have trouble keeping our balance on the uneven ground. Even stopping a fall on a sidewalk becomes more difficult as our balance declines...according to Kathy, our balance begins declining at age 40. I thought I had good balance & was surprised when I had trouble with some of these exercises. Again, some of these exercises might prove difficult if you have knee problems.~Total Energy~ focuses on stretching & yoga type exercises to help us de-stress &  maintain energy throughout the day.I always feel better after I exercise & hope to incorporate the Total Body Turnaround into a daily fitness routine.Because some of these exercises involve lunging, I suggest that you don't purchase this DVD if you have knee problems.Equipment needed: Light hand weights and a mat or carpeted surface",4,For the beginner to intermediate exerciser...if you have knee problems you might want to skip this DVD,1341446400,"07 5, 2012",2012,2392,"[""'m"", 'early', '60', 'have', 'been', 'ignoring', 'physical', 'fitness', 'couple', 'years', 'now', 'found', 'parts', 'exercise', 'DVD', 'be', 'tiny', 'bit', 'challenging', 'doable', 'was', 'tired', 'completing', 'first', 'two', 'workouts', 'Total', 'Circuit', 'Total', 'Balance', 'Kathy', 'lunges', 'squats', 'hops', 'routines', 'have', 'knee', 'problems', 'arthritis', 'feet', 'might', 'have', 'difficulty', 'movements', 'easier', 'alternate', 'moves', 'exercises', 'not', 'them.Kathy', 'Smith', 'Total', 'Body', 'Turnaround', 'will', 'move', 'joint', 'body.The', 'DVD', 'centers', 'three', 'separate', '20', 'minute', 'workouts', 'geared', 'specific', 'outcome', 'easy', 'choose', 'one', 'more', 'workouts', 'initially', 'chose', 'do', 'three', 'next', 'time', 'will', 'focus', 'Total', 'Circuit', 'Total', 'Balance', 'workouts.~Total', 'Circuit~', 'light', 'weights', 'aerobics', 'focus', 'fitness', 'calorie', 'burning', 'cardio', ""'ll"", 'tone', 'strengthen', 'legs', 'buttocks', 'arms', 'core', 'trimming', 'waistline', 'are', 'lunges', 'squats', 'hopping', 'exercise', 'routine', 'might', 'prove', 'difficult', 'have', 'knee', 'problems', 'exercises', 'not', 'Kathy', 'alternat', 'moves', 'find', 'particular', 'movement', 'too', 'difficult.~Total', 'Balance~', 'strengthening', 'muscle', 'groups', 'can', 'maintain', 'balance', 'age', 'Balance', 'exercises', 'are', 'often', 'ignored', 'most', 'exercise', 'programs', 'appreciate', ""'re"", 'included', 'DVD', 'Kathy', 'age', 'begin', 'losing', 'balance', 'world', 'smaller', 'might', 'not', 'want', 'go', 'hiking', 'might', 'have', 'trouble', 'keeping', 'balance', 'uneven', 'ground', 'Even', 'stopping', 'fall', 'sidewalk', 'more', 'difficult', 'balance', 'declines', 'according', 'Kathy', 'balance', 'declining', 'age', '40', 'thought', 'had', 'good', 'balance', 'was', 'surprised', 'when', 'had', 'trouble', 'exercises', 'Again', 'exercises', 'might', 'prove', 'difficult', 'have', 'knee', 'problems.~Total', 'Energy~', 'stretching', 'yoga', 'type', 'help', 'de-stress', 'maintain', 'energy', 'day.I', 'always', 'feel', 'better', 'exercise', 'hope', 'incorporate', 'Total', 'Body', 'Turnaround', 'daily', 'fitness', 'routine.Because', 'exercises', 'involve', 'lunging', 'suggest', 'do', ""n't"", 'purchase', 'DVD', 'have', 'knee', 'problems.Equipment', 'needed', 'Light', 'hand', 'weights', 'mat', 'carpeted', 'surface']",AGELESS WITH KATHY SMITH: TOTAL BODY TURNAROUND
1460814,A17SZZO9LM3WYC,B005GYXNT0,"Mayflower Girl ""amazon-junkie since 1996""","[0, 0]","I first did a Kathy Smith workout (VHS in those days) at least 30 years ago.  She still looks great--although a little too thin--and still has some of the best cueing on the market.  If only I'd kept up with it these past 30 years. :)There are three different 20 minute workouts--and you can do one or more each time.  If you're a total beginner, then I'd probably pick one of the three--and do that same workout 3x/week.  The next week, do it again.  The third week, either add a day or add in one of the other workouts, etc.  If you're used to exercising, then one nice feature is you can do 2 or more workouts in the same session--but perhaps finish the whole tape during the day. I like the Total Circuit workout for the morning.  If I have time, I throw in the Total Energy....and then I like Total Balance (which is kind of Yoga-y) for pre-bed.  I actually have a different Yoga tape which I like a lot better calledYoga Journal: Yoga for Morning, Noon & Night with Jason Crandell.  So, in future, I'll probably add in that--and then possibly keep Kathy's Total Circuit workout.  One caveat is that Kathy loves squats and lunges far more than my 40+ knees do.  That's one thing I like about Leslie Sansone--no squats, no lunges (at least that I remember).

1460815,A2F0KIA4NMIZHQ,B005GYXNT0,Peter Tsang,"[115, 120]","""Ageless with Kathy Smith: Total Body Turnaround"" contains three short workouts, with Ms. Smith as the sole instructor and demonstrator.  The focus is on combatting the aging process for those who are already active.  Some may classify these workouts as between beginning and intermediate, or possibly intermediate, designed to help people similar to Ms. Smith maintain their strength or vitality, along with their balance and flexibility.Here is the breakdown.Total Circuit (about 24 minutes)Ms. Smith alternates between cardio bursts and weight training. Dumbbells are used for the following exercises.Bent over rowBiceps curlShoulder pressOne legged deadliftModified lungeTriceps extension & other related movementsUsually, low and high impact versions are shown for the aerobics.  This workout also includes squats and pushups.  It has its own warm up and a stretch cool down.Total Balance (about 20 minutes)This workout is a mix of cardio and balance work.  It also includes plies, 1st position work, and double squats.  You may want a wall or chair to balance.  It has its own warm up and stretch cool down.Total Energy (about 20 minutes)The workout begins with stretches and ends in stretches.  This workout includes standing light movements, floor movements, and a little yoga.  A mat is needed.~~~There are also two very short bonus workouts from other instructors.Upper Body Tone & Stretch from the ""Exhale Core Fusion: Lean and Toned"" DVD uses weights.

1460816,A32HAMICRE52M,B005GYXNT0,Pippa Lee,"[1, 1]","At first when I ordered this DVD, I tried to remember why back in my younger days I wasn't into Kathy Smith's workouts. However, once I popped the DVD in my player, I stopped caring about the reason because right then and there I found myself enjoying her ""Total Body Turnaround.""You don't need a huge space for doing the workouts but you need enough to move forward, backward and sideways. Also, you'll need a mat and dumbbells.  Have a chair handy if your balance is not very good.  ""Total Body Turnaround"" consists of three 20-minute workouts. The first one, Total Circuit, alternates cardio with weight training. The three 3-minute low impact aerobic segments are very easy to follow. They are simple routines made up of variations of knee- to -elbow steps, side lunges, squats and hops (or pop-ups as Kathy calls them). For the weight training portions, Kathy does one-arm rows, biceps curls, shoulder presses, kickbacks and pushups.The second workout, Total Balance, took me by surprise because I thought it was going to be like a balance yoga routine.  Instead, it is a light aerobic workout; however, you suddenly stop the movement and try to hold your balance while standing on one leg, which forces you to use your core muscles. I felt this one in my thighs too because there is also a pli&eacute; segment and had to balance on my toes.Total Energy is the last workout and it has some yoga movements to help stretch the back, hips and legs. It ends with nice and relaxing chest, hips and wrists circles.  Kathy Smith is a great instructor. She brims with lots of energy as she talks you through the workouts. She shows modifications for those who either need to lower or increase the intensity.  I took it easy this time and didn't break a sweat, but I could see that if I were to use heavier dumbbells and pick up the pace (or go ballistic, as Kathy says), I'd be in for a more challenging workout.  Time has put its stamp on Kathy but I think she looks amazing and wish that when I get to be her age, I might have her spring in my step and her twinkle in my eyes.",4,Good workouts for any fitness level,1332633600,"03 25, 2012",2012,2075,"['first', 'when', 'ordered', 'DVD', 'tried', 'remember', 'why', 'back', 'younger', 'days', 'was', ""n't"", 'Kathy', 'Smith', 'workouts', 'However', 'once', 'popped', 'DVD', 'player', 'stopped', 'caring', 'reason', 'right', 'then', 'there', 'found', 'enjoying', 'Total', 'Body', 'Turnaround', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'huge', 'space', 'doing', 'workouts', 'need', 'enough', 'move', 'forward', 'backward', 'sideways', 'Also', ""'ll"", 'need', 'mat', 'dumbbells', 'Have', 'chair', 'handy', 'balance', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'Total', 'Body', 'Turnaround', 'three', '20-minute', 'workouts', 'first', 'one', 'Total', 'Circuit', 'cardio', 'weight', 'training', 'three', '3-minute', 'low', 'impact', 'aerobic', 'segments', 'are', 'very', 'easy', 'follow', 'are', 'simple', 'routines', 'made', 'variations', 'knee-', '-elbow', 'steps', 'side', 'lunges', 'squats', 'hops', 'pop-ups', 'Kathy', 'weight', 'training', 'portions', 'Kathy', 'one-arm', 'rows', 'biceps', 'curls', 'shoulder', 'presses', 'kickbacks', 'pushups.The', 'second', 'workout', 'Total', 'Balance', 'took', 'surprise', 'thought', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'balance', 'yoga', 'routine', 'Instead', 'light', 'aerobic', 'workout', 'however', 'suddenly', 'stop', 'movement', 'try', 'hold', 'balance', 'standing', 'one', 'leg', 'use', 'core', 'muscles', 'felt', 'one', 'thighs', 'too', 'also', 'pli', 'eacute', 'segment', 'had', 'balance', 'toes.Total', 'Energy', 'last', 'workout', 'yoga', 'movements', 'help', 'stretch', 'back', 'hips', 'legs', 'nice', 'relaxing', 'chest', 'hips', 'wrists', 'circles', 'Kathy', 'Smith', 'great', 'instructor', 'lots', 'energy', 'workouts', 'modifications', 'who', 'either', 'need', 'lower', 'increase', 'intensity', 'took', 'easy', 'time', 'did', ""n't"", 'break', 'sweat', 'could', 'see', 'were', 'use', 'heavier', 'dumbbells', 'pick', 'up', 'pace', 'go', 'ballistic', 'Kathy', ""'d"", 'be', 'more', 'challenging', 'workout', 'Time', 'put', 'stamp', 'Kathy', 'think', 'amazing', 'wish', 'when', 'get', 'be', 'age', 'might', 'have', 'spring', 'step', 'twinkle', 'eyes']",AGELESS WITH KATHY SMITH: TOTAL BODY TURNAROUND

1460818,A3TPNC3TKGCCEI,B005GYXNT0,"Raquel S. ""Avid Amazon Fan and Kindle User""","[2, 2]","It's been years since I've popped in a workout DVD. Kathy Smith's Ageless DVD is reminding me of that very well. She has me worn out in 10 minutes. Ageless offeres three workout options that can be done separately or combined to a 40 or 60 minute full body workout.The first routine is circuit training. Kathy goes through a cycle of upbeat moves to get the heartbeat going, followed by some muscle burning strength exercises to tone muscle. While the moves are not complicated, they sure burn if you're not in shape. Both upper and lower body are targeted.The second routine is focused on balance but is also a muscle burner as well (for us who are out of shape or new to it). Big moves help keep the heart rate up while working on tone and balance.The third routine is a slower stretch and yoga routine. This is more of what I need to get started in the morning when I feel like a pretzel.Kathy looks quite buff in this DVD. While she is looking older, she is aging well and seems quite the spunk. Wow, is she sporting muscles.I feel this DVD is good for beginners, those who have fallen off the wagon and out of shape, and intermediates who prefer to keep their movements uncomplicated but still challenging. While Kathy does use weights, not having any won't hold you back. While Kathy does show some snappy pylometric moves, she also encourages to modify it down if you cannot do that.Ageless did remind me how out of shape I've become. Ugh. I need to get back into a routine like this to work my way back into some sort of shape that better than jellyfish and useless as I get older. Seeing Kathy buff at her age is encouraging. I wish she had slowed it down a little in the workouts, but then perhaps it's better for me that she didn't.",4,"Thanks, Kathy, for reminding me how out of shape I am.

I was attracted to the concept of short routines.  I'm trying to squeeze in additional mini workouts before work and twenty minutes sounded perfect.For the most part, I liked the workouts.  The moves were not necessarily innovative but they are moves I do not do on my own on a regular basis. The content encourages a lot of swinging, hopping, reaching and squatting.  After the first twenty minute work out, I really felt it for two days afterward and had a little stiffness to my step.I didn't feel like Kathy goes low enough on the squats (most people don't) and sometimes the routines were a little hard to follow (I was no cheerleader or dancer in school).  When I had trouble following, I just improvised with something similar or did jumping jacks to keep the heart rate up. Kathy encourages adjustments although I think this encouragement could be more prominent at times.  She uses weights that I know others would have problems with, especially those that are trying to get back in the exercise game.  Just remember you can use lighter weights and if you have problem with a move - move in your own way.Overall, Kathy is energetic and a has a good, encouraging personality. I thought the moves added something to my workout routine and are adjustable based on a person's fitness level.  The positive experience with this video would lead me to try other workout videos.3.5 - 4 stars",4,Good length for a pre-work exercise session,1334620800,"04 17, 2012",2012,1641,"[""'ve"", 'never', 'used', 'workout', 'videos', 'high', 'cost', 'gym', 'membership', 'monotony', 'what', 'am', 'capable', 'doing', 'own', 'basement', 'rowing', 'machine', 'spinning', 'bike', 'hula', 'hoop', 'general', 'calisthenics', 'thought', 'would', 'give', 'video', 'shot', 'was', 'attracted', 'concept', 'short', 'routines', ""'m"", 'trying', 'squeeze', 'additional', 'mini', 'workouts', 'work', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'sounded', 'perfect.For', 'most', 'part', 'liked', 'workouts', 'moves', 'were', 'not', 'necessarily', 'innovative', 'are', 'moves', 'do', 'not', 'do', 'own', 'regular', 'basis', 'content', 'lot', 'swinging', 'hopping', 'reaching', 'squatting', 'first', 'twenty', 'minute', 'work', 'really', 'felt', 'two', 'days', 'afterward', 'had', 'little', 'stiffness', 'step.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'Kathy', 'low', 'enough', 'squats', 'most', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'routines', 'were', 'little', 'hard', 'follow', 'was', 'cheerleader', 'dancer', 'school', 'When', 'had', 'trouble', 'following', 'just', 'improvised', 'something', 'similar', 'did', 'jumping', 'jacks', 'keep', 'heart', 'rate', 'up', 'Kathy', 'adjustments', 'think', 'encouragement', 'could', 'be', 'more', 'prominent', 'times', 'weights', 'know', 'others', 'would', 'have', 'problems', 'especially', 'are', 'trying', 'get', 'back', 'exercise', 'game', 'Just', 'remember', 'can', 'use', 'lighter', 'weights', 'have', 'problem', 'move', 'move', 'own', 'way.Overall', 'Kathy', 'energetic', 'good', 'encouraging', 'personality', 'thought', 'moves', 'added', 'something', 'workout', 'routine', 'are', 'adjustable', 'based', 'person', 'fitness', 'level', 'positive', 'experience', 'video', 'would', 'lead', 'try', 'other', 'workout', 'videos.3.5', '4', 'stars']",AGELESS WITH KATHY SMITH: TOTAL BODY TURNAROUND

If you are a Jilian Micheals workout girl, don't bother to read any further you wil Le boooored.  If you don't like the Jillian Micheals and wished Jane Fonda's former workouts were in DVDs, and you like low impact, then read on.1) circuit. Very low impact applying the traditional form of weight work and you will need a chair for stabilization and one set of weights.  Each form just focuses on a set of muscles and does not apply multiple muscles to work out more efficiently.  I was not too impressed with the form and if you have never worked out before then this is not a great DVD to learn the proper form.  (there are better DVDs that show you much better form). I was a little concerned in this section as she was jumping around that she was close to the chair a lot: it was distracting.  Properly one star as the poor form was critical for people to avoid injuries.2) balance.  Imagine tree pose with lots of kicks, or imagine jumping star where both feet do not leave the ground? A lot of arms waving and imagine john Travolta doing Saturday nights fever withe the Bee Gees?  Low impact, but the moves were quick and I recommend you watch it once as she moved onto the next moves too quickly.3) energize. Hmm, more like yoga stretches and a lot of bottom wiggles.  She jumps around the moves too quickly and since there is not repetitions, you may miss many of the moves.  I can understand you have loosen your core for the energy to move up your spine, then the moves in this DVD will make sense.I found it hard to like this DVD, since I was concerned with the poor form I the circuit section.  The energize section could be fun, but I would recommend kundalini yoga for better form.

I can't see myself ever doing this dvd again. While it's not irredeemably awful, there are too many better options out there to waste time on this one. Hence, two stars.I could not figure out who would benefit from this workout. While it's not difficult, it's probably too much for true beginners or those out of shape. The pacing is awkward, and modifications aren't given until a sequence is practically over. Anyone above that is going to be bored as the routines are nothing new (knee lift repeaters, anyone?).

1460829,A2I4A4WGWII18Z,B005GYXNT0,Sunny Sewing Honeybee,"[1, 1]","On this DVD, instructor Kathy Smith focuses on three things:- Weight loss (circuit), a twenty minute workout designed for the most traditional results of exercise.- Balance, which devotes twenty minutes to trying to increase a person's ability to resist falls.- Energy, a twenty minute workout designed to give a boost of energy. In the bonus features, Smith says it's like a boost of green tea.Expert host Smith is really energetic and passionate, which is a great attribute for inspiring her viewers to continue with the program. I really like how she alone is doing the exercises. There isn't a group behind her, so the video is more relaxed and personal. It's more like you have a personal trainer or friend you're exercising with, not an entire class.One thing I want to address is . . . Who is the target audience? The back of the DVD says that it's like a ""reset button."" However, the DVD bonus features imply more that Smith is trying to target an older audience already in good shape that wants to stay that way. That's two different audiences: One out of shape that wants to ""reset,"" and one that wishes to retain being in shape. With the target audience being older, this difference is important. I personally think the DVD would be best for those who are already in shape. Smith is in great shape and really energetic. For those with hip or back injuries who have possibly already had problems with balance, some of the exercises could be quite painful. As someone with a prior serious sciatic nerve injury, my back starts hurting within a few minutes of the program. Of course, any exercise routines require speaking to a doctor first to see if they're safe. However, it's important to know at the outset that the exercises aren't as mild as the targeted age bracket might suggest. The video is likely best suited for an older audience that's already fit and toned, and looking for a way to remain so.",4,"Great DVD, best suited for those who are already fit",1334534400,"04 16, 2012",2012,1914,"['DVD', 'instructor', 'Kathy', 'Smith', 'three', 'things', 'Weight', 'loss', 'circuit', 'twenty', 'minute', 'workout', 'designed', 'most', 'traditional', 'results', 'exercise.-', 'Balance', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'trying', 'increase', 'person', 'ability', 'resist', 'falls.-', 'Energy', 'twenty', 'minute', 'workout', 'designed', 'give', 'boost', 'energy', 'bonus', 'features', 'Smith', 'boost', 'green', 'tea.Expert', 'host', 'Smith', 'really', 'energetic', 'passionate', 'great', 'attribute', 'inspiring', 'viewers', 'continue', 'program', 'really', 'how', 'alone', 'doing', 'exercises', ""n't"", 'group', 'video', 'more', 'relaxed', 'personal', 'more', 'have', 'personal', 'trainer', 'friend', ""'re"", 'exercising', 'not', 'entire', 'class.One', 'thing', 'want', 'address', 'Who', 'target', 'audience', 'back', 'DVD', 'reset', 'button', 'However', 'DVD', 'bonus', 'imply', 'more', 'Smith', 'trying', 'target', 'older', 'audience', 'already', 'good', 'shape', 'stay', 'way', 'two', 'different', 'audiences', 'One', 'shape', 'reset', 'one', 'retain', 'being', 'shape', 'target', 'audience', 'being', 'older', 'difference', 'important', 'personally', 'think', 'DVD', 'would', 'be', 'best', 'who', 'are', 'already', 'shape', 'Smith', 'great', 'shape', 'really', 'energetic', 'hip', 'back', 'injuries', 'who', 'have', 'possibly', 'already', 'had', 'problems', 'balance', 'exercises', 'could', 'be', 'quite', 'painful', 'someone', 'prior', 'serious', 'sciatic', 'nerve', 'injury', 'back', 'starts', 'hurting', 'few', 'minutes', 'program', 'course', 'exercise', 'routines', 'require', 'speaking', 'doctor', 'first', 'see', ""'re"", 'safe', 'However', 'important', 'know', 'outset', 'exercises', 'are', ""n't"", 'as', 'mild', 'targeted', 'age', 'bracket', 'might', 'suggest', 'video', 'likely', 'best', 'suited', 'older', 'audience', 'already', 'fit', 'toned', 'looking', 'way', 'remain', 'so']",AGELESS WITH KATHY SMITH: TOTAL BODY TURNAROUND
1460830,A23O8T3LNL9YY8,B005GYXNT0,"Trish ""A Sun Salutin', Crochet Hookin' Chick!""","[0, 0]","I have several Kathy Smith DVD's and I like them even though they are a little quirky.  Sometimes she gets off rhythm, says right when she means left, or starts to say a muscle then changes midway, but I like it.This DVD is more geared for a beginner to intermediate exerciser.  Not to say an advanced exerciser would not enjoy it, but he/she would have to add propulsion or heavier weights to get the heart rate up.The first twenty minutes is a cardio/scuplt session.  It starts with a short warm-up and then a cardio session followed by a scuplt session.  Kathy starts the cardio atanding on a concrete floor (not perfect in the exercise world, but ok) with non-jumping moves and then adds propulsion if needed.  The scuplting sessions cover most major body parts.  For this section you will need 1-2 dumbell sets-3-8 pounds each.Overall, it's a very good workout.The second twenty minutes is a balance/sculpt session.  Kathy is barefoot in this part.  I like this part, because not very many exercise DVD's focus on balance (except maybe mind/body DVD's) and flexibility.  Flexablity and balance build the core, which helps with lower back problems and preventing falls.  The movements are slow and fluid. The scuplt part uses you body weight. For this section you need a chair or balance stick for balance.The third section involves mostly yoga type moves.  Barefoot again.  You will do the most well-known yoga moves-lunges, downward dog, triangle, cobra, etc.  For this section you will need a mat.I gave this DVD 4 stars because Kathy Smith has a fun personality.  She has great legs for her age, a positive role model for the baby boomers, and the emphasis on safety and health.  I  took a half star off because this DVD could have easily been customizable, allowing the viewer to add the sections they like in the order they like..it is not.  I also think that a 20 minute cardio section is a little short on it's own for health purposes.  Making it customizable would have allowed the viewer to add the two cardio sections together, and make a decent length DVD...otherwise, it's pretty good.",4,Great for the beginner to intermediate exerciser...,1332374400,"03 22, 2012",2012,2102,"['have', 'several', 'Kathy', 'Smith', 'DVD', 'like', 'even', 'are', 'little', 'quirky', 'Sometimes', 'off', 'rhythm', 'right', 'when', 'left', 'say', 'muscle', 'then', 'midway', 'like', 'it.This', 'DVD', 'more', 'geared', 'beginner', 'intermediate', 'exerciser', 'Not', 'say', 'advanced', 'exerciser', 'would', 'not', 'enjoy', 'he/she', 'would', 'have', 'add', 'propulsion', 'heavier', 'weights', 'get', 'heart', 'rate', 'first', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'cardio/scuplt', 'session', 'short', 'warm-up', 'then', 'cardio', 'session', 'followed', 'scuplt', 'session', 'Kathy', 'cardio', 'atanding', 'concrete', 'floor', 'not', 'perfect', 'exercise', 'world', 'ok', 'non-jumping', 'moves', 'then', 'propulsion', 'needed', 'scuplting', 'sessions', 'cover', 'most', 'major', 'body', 'parts', 'section', 'will', 'need', '1-2', 'dumbell', 'sets-3-8', 'pounds', 'each.Overall', 'very', 'good', 'workout.The', 'second', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'balance/sculpt', 'session', 'Kathy', 'barefoot', 'part', 'part', 'not', 'very', 'many', 'exercise', 'DVD', 'focus', 'balance', 'maybe', 'mind/body', 'DVD', 'flexibility', 'Flexablity', 'balance', 'build', 'core', 'lower', 'back', 'problems', 'preventing', 'falls', 'movements', 'are', 'slow', 'fluid', 'scuplt', 'part', 'body', 'weight', 'section', 'need', 'chair', 'balance', 'stick', 'balance.The', 'third', 'section', 'mostly', 'yoga', 'type', 'moves', 'Barefoot', 'again', 'will', 'do', 'most', 'well-known', 'yoga', 'moves-lunges', 'downward', 'dog', 'triangle', 'cobra', 'etc', 'section', 'will', 'need', 'mat.I', 'gave', 'DVD', '4', 'stars', 'Kathy', 'Smith', 'fun', 'personality', 'great', 'legs', 'age', 'positive', 'role', 'model', 'baby', 'boomers', 'emphasis', 'safety', 'health', 'took', 'half', 'star', 'off', 'DVD', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'been', 'customizable', 'allowing', 'viewer', 'add', 'sections', 'like', 'order', 'like..it', 'not', 'also', 'think', '20', 'minute', 'cardio', 'section', 'little', 'short', 'own', 'health', 'purposes', 'Making', 'customizable', 'would', 'have', 'allowed', 'viewer', 'add', 'two', 'cardio', 'sections', 'together', 'make', 'decent', 'length', 'DVD', 'otherwise', 'pretty', 'good']",AGELESS WITH KATHY SMITH: TOTAL BODY TURNAROUND
