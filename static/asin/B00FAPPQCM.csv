1670974,A1MECEHZHFE5PT,B00FAPPQCM,"Dayna Newman ""Slasher Diva""","[2, 3]","I am always excited to check out a new 'Slasher flick"" but I would classify this as more of a psychological thriller with some  minor slashing involved.The film itself was kind of all over the place with too many unnecessary characters and some very annoying characters to boot.the acting was somewhat sketchy but ""Tim Barraco"" as Jim was a redeeming factor in the acting department.I thought he did a nice job with what he was given.On the other hand ""Trevor Torseth"" who is credited as (the Marine) was really annoying  and over acted although he either got better as the film progressed or I just got used to him.That was a shame seeing as he was in 9 /10ths of the film.Trevor Torseth best known to horror fans for playing ""Kane Lake"" one of the mute inbred twins in the After Dark Horror Fest's film (Lake Dead ) I now see why they chose him to be mute!!The story was your basic crazy person or people terrorize campers in the woods.there was some bloody violence but no real gore  ,the closest thing to it was some  gun shots a couple of stabbings and slit throats.what few effects they had were well done but just not enough.If you are going to use 'Trail Of Blood' as your film title and have someone with an Ax on the cover you might want to have someone with an ax in the film.The beginning was promising then it went into a mundane lull until about the last 25 minutes where it picked up speed and got interesting .The climax was pretty exciting and made me feel better about  the money I paid for the rental.If you want to see a really good (crazy person or people terrorize campers in the woods) film check out ""Resurrection County"" ""The Hike"" or the Norwegian film 'Rovdyr"" the American title is Manhunt.",3,"Don't shoot, I'm a Marine",1388966400,"01 6, 2014",2014,1718,"['am', 'always', 'excited', 'check', 'out', 'new', 'flick', 'would', 'classify', 'more', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'minor', 'slashing', 'involved.The', 'film', 'was', 'kind', 'place', 'too', 'many', 'unnecessary', 'characters', 'very', 'annoying', 'characters', 'boot.the', 'acting', 'was', 'somewhat', 'sketchy', 'Tim', 'Barraco', 'Jim', 'was', 'redeeming', 'factor', 'acting', 'department.I', 'thought', 'did', 'nice', 'job', 'what', 'was', 'given.On', 'other', 'hand', 'Trevor', 'Torseth', 'who', 'credited', 'Marine', 'was', 'really', 'annoying', 'over', 'acted', 'got', 'better', 'film', 'progressed', 'just', 'got', 'used', 'was', 'shame', 'seeing', 'was', '9', '/10ths', 'film.Trevor', 'Torseth', 'best', 'known', 'horror', 'fans', 'playing', 'Kane', 'Lake', 'one', 'mute', 'inbred', 'twins', 'Dark', 'Horror', 'Fest', 'film', 'Lake', 'Dead', 'now', 'see', 'why', 'chose', 'be', 'mute', 'story', 'was', 'basic', 'crazy', 'person', 'people', 'terrorize', 'campers', 'woods.there', 'was', 'bloody', 'violence', 'real', 'gore', 'closest', 'thing', 'was', 'gun', 'shots', 'couple', 'stabbings', 'slit', 'throats.what', 'few', 'effects', 'had', 'were', 'well', 'done', 'just', 'not', 'enough.If', 'are', 'going', 'use', ""'Trail"", 'Blood', 'film', 'title', 'have', 'someone', 'Ax', 'cover', 'might', 'want', 'have', 'someone', 'ax', 'film.The', 'beginning', 'was', 'promising', 'then', 'went', 'mundane', 'lull', 'last', '25', 'minutes', 'where', 'picked', 'up', 'speed', 'got', 'interesting', '.The', 'climax', 'was', 'pretty', 'exciting', 'made', 'feel', 'better', 'money', 'paid', 'rental.If', 'want', 'see', 'really', 'good', 'crazy', 'person', 'people', 'terrorize', 'campers', 'woods', 'film', 'check', 'Resurrection', 'County', 'Hike', 'Norwegian', 'film', 'American', 'title', 'Manhunt']",Trail Of Blood Digital

1670976,ADWQPR0LJD4J,B00FAPPQCM,"ERSInk . com ""Eric""","[1, 3]","Lionsgate has done nobody a favor by releasing the catatonia-inducing slasher flick &#34;Trail of Blood.&#34; Whoever tricked Joe Dante into putting his name on this should be awarded greatly. All we get here is a complete retread of every camping trip-gone-bad movie that's been forced on us since &#34;Friday the 13th&#34; hit theaters in 1980.A group of friends head out on a weekend camping trip of drinking and debauchery. They've apparently never seen &#34;The Burning,&#34; any of the 12 &#34;Friday the 13th&#34; movies, or the countless other slasher movies warning them this is a bad idea. They stumble on a couple who have been brutally murdered. As they try to figure out what to do, the group find themselves being held captive by a crazed Marine and his bleach-blond girlfriend. The two believe the bunch are responsible for the deaths of the slaughtered couple and plan to make them pay for it.Yes, &#34;Trail of Blood&#34; really is as ho-hum and forgettable as it sounds. There's absolutely nothing here to get excited about. It looks like it was shot with a typical HD camera that anyone could pick up at an electronics store. Granted, the shooting quality doesn't look like it was the cinematographer's first time behind a lens. I'd say probably their third or fourth. One good thing is it's not a &#34;found footage&#34; film.The only star actor in &#34;Trail of Blood&#34; is Robert Picardo. He must have had a large traffic ticket to pay off or used this as a means to grab some extra cash to play with while in Vegas or something. All I can say is Picardo is much too good to be doing drivel like this. He does a great job lingering behind trees and looking menacing, though.There are a couple extra features included for &#34;Trail of Blood.&#34; Directors Joseph and Justin Guerrieri provide audio commentary. A trailer gallery is included as well.&#34;Trail of Blood&#34; is rated R for strong bloody violence, language, brief nudity, and drug use. In other words, it's just like every other slasher movie released in the past few decades. Why would they break the stale mold here of all places?I love slasher movies and I really don't feel like I ask much when watching them. However, when it's so obvious that you're following a checklist of things to do with no inspiration to go outside of the box, I completely lose interest. If you're going to pay homage to the great gory thrillers of the 1970s and 1980s, at least try to add something new to the formula.",2,"&#8220;Trail of Blood"" Leaves a Trail of Boredom",1386892800,"12 13, 2013",2013,2488,"['Lionsgate', 'done', 'nobody', 'favor', 'releasing', 'catatonia-inducing', 'slasher', 'flick', '34', 'Trail', 'Blood.', '34', 'Whoever', 'tricked', 'Joe', 'Dante', 'putting', 'name', 'should', 'be', 'awarded', 'greatly', 'get', 'here', 'complete', 'retread', 'camping', 'trip-gone-bad', 'movie', 'been', 'forced', '34', 'Friday', '13th', '34', 'hit', 'theaters', '1980.A', 'group', 'friends', 'head', 'out', 'weekend', 'camping', 'trip', 'drinking', 'debauchery', ""'ve"", 'apparently', 'never', 'seen', '34', 'Burning', '34', '12', '34', 'Friday', '13th', '34', 'movies', 'countless', 'other', 'slasher', 'movies', 'warning', 'bad', 'idea', 'stumble', 'couple', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'brutally', 'murdered', 'try', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'do', 'group', 'find', 'being', 'held', 'captive', 'crazed', 'Marine', 'bleach-blond', 'girlfriend', 'two', 'believe', 'bunch', 'are', 'responsible', 'deaths', 'slaughtered', 'couple', 'plan', 'make', 'pay', 'it.Yes', '34', 'Trail', 'Blood', '34', 'really', 'ho-hum', 'forgettable', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'here', 'get', 'excited', 'was', 'shot', 'typical', 'HD', 'camera', 'anyone', 'could', 'pick', 'up', 'electronics', 'store', 'Granted', 'shooting', 'quality', ""n't"", 'look', 'was', 'cinematographer', 'first', 'time', 'lens', ""'d"", 'say', 'probably', 'third', 'fourth', 'One', 'good', 'thing', 'not', '34', 'found', 'footage', '34', 'film.The', 'only', 'star', 'actor', '34', 'Trail', 'Blood', '34', 'Robert', 'Picardo', 'must', 'have', 'had', 'large', 'traffic', 'ticket', 'pay', 'off', 'used', 'means', 'grab', 'extra', 'cash', 'play', 'while', 'Vegas', 'something', 'can', 'say', 'Picardo', 'much', 'too', 'good', 'be', 'doing', 'drivel', 'great', 'job', 'lingering', 'trees', 'looking', 'menacing', 'are', 'couple', 'extra', 'features', 'included', '34', 'Trail', 'Blood.', '34', 'Directors', 'Joseph', 'Justin', 'Guerrieri', 'provide', 'audio', 'commentary', 'trailer', 'gallery', 'included', 'well.', '34', 'Trail', 'Blood', '34', 'rated', 'R', 'strong', 'bloody', 'violence', 'language', 'brief', 'nudity', 'drug', 'use', 'other', 'words', 'just', 'like', 'other', 'slasher', 'movie', 'released', 'past', 'few', 'decades', 'Why', 'would', 'break', 'stale', 'mold', 'here', 'places', 'love', 'slasher', 'movies', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'ask', 'much', 'when', 'watching', 'However', 'when', 'so', 'obvious', ""'re"", 'following', 'checklist', 'things', 'do', 'inspiration', 'go', 'box', 'completely', 'lose', 'interest', ""'re"", 'going', 'pay', 'homage', 'great', 'gory', 'thrillers', '1970s', '1980s', 'least', 'try', 'add', 'something', 'new', 'formula']",Trail Of Blood Digital
