968491,A2VN15501IUTND,B000E5KUKG,"D. Christensen ""Jesus Freak""","[0, 1]","I am a huge fan of the Left Behind books. They are masterful, easily my favorite books of all time. I agree with the basic theology presented, and I find the characters, plot, and general themes very interesting and engaging. After reading the books like a madman, getting through one on average about every 4-5 days, I received the movies for Christmas. I had mixed expectations for several reasons, the chief of which was just what I had heard about the movies, that they were okay, but nothing special. I'll now present a triple review for the triple pack of movies.Left Behind: The Movie - 2000In my opinion, a Left Behind movie could be something fantastic, a great outreach to unbelievers, especially since movies tend to be more widespread in their attraction than books, which nowadays are more a niche thing anyway. However, this first LB movie falls a bit short in multiple places. I'll start with the bad and work my way up to the good. This movie is way too short. 90 minutes is NOT enough runtime for a movie as epic as a movie based of the book has the potential to be. I realize that basing a movie off of a book has it's quirks and limitations, because vastly more content is contained in a book than in a movie. But I felt like they changed and compressed too much about this movie. If you've read the books, you know that things take a while to unfold after the Rapture. You have several chapters where Rayford is sitting at home worried sick about Chloe and Hattie among others. In the movie everybody shows up right at the same time, there's very little mourning compared to the books, etc. I really felt like they could have made this movie 2 hours and a 2 and a half hours and it would have been much more engaging. It really felt to me like it was just a highlight reel of the books, with all the absolute most important characters getting some screen time, and other characters that were only slightly less important in the books are totally ignored. Case in point: Steve Plank. In the books he was a prime character, Buck's closest friend and mentor. Not here at all. Not even a mention of his name. They also compressed a lot of story elements, such as how Hattie came to be involved with Nicolae. Another aspect is the drama that takes place after Rayford and Hattie's plane has landed at O'Hare. It doesn't seem like there's enough craziness compared to the books. And the fact that during that sequence the primary focus of attention is a little dog whose owner apparently got raptured is just a disservice to the books. The special effects, while few, are not very well done. But considering that this is an independent Christian film, that's really to be expected, and I think that the lack of ability to pull off Star Wars/Lord of the Rings-esque SFX also contributed to why the film was so short, because a lot of scenes in the books really would require a rather large budget and advanced special effects. The final qualm I have with this first film is the lack of a true Gospel presentation. In the books it is made clear on multiple occasions the Gospel story and how one can be saved from their sins. In this movie they hint around at it, and maybe mention the name of God once, never mentioning Jesus. I find that upsetting because I think this film could be a really good outreach tool, if there was a good Gospel presentation. Now on to the good. I felt like the acting was really quite good, and the casting was well done as well. Kirk Cameron is, well, Kirk Cameron. He's Christian acting's poster boy, and he really stands out in this movie as Buck. Clarence Gilyard was superb as Bruce Barnes, though in the book he was described a plump, kind of nerdy guy who wore glasses and had short curly hair. Clarence Gilyard is almost the exact opposite of that, if you know what I mean, but still he did a marvelous job. Brad Johnson as Rayford Steele does a good, if underrated job. He really is able to convey the emotions his character is described as having in the books. Janaya Stephens as Chloe does a decent job, but I feel like she's not quite up to par with the rest of the cast. She is also described as being a cute blonde, where as Stephens is a cute brunette. Chelsea Noble Cameron (Kirk's wife) is really good as Hattie. In the books she is described as one of those stunner type women, who every guy goes nuts about. Chelsea Noble fits that bill perfectly, and is about as close to how I imagined Hattie in the books as one can get. Gordon Currie as Nicolae Carpathia does fantastically, and his Russian-Romanian accent is done really well. He's not really described as being short and wiry in the books, he is described as being tall and muscular, with a build like that of an Olympic swimmer. Regardless, the acting and casting in this film really save it from total demise. I give it a 4 out of 5 stars.Left Behind II: Tribulation Force - 2002The second installment in the LB movie series is about on par with the first. The entire cast from the first movie returns to reprise their roles from the first. I'm afraid though that this one also suffers from the same troubles as the first, just more pronounced. They stray from the story even more, and add and change and mix and combine more things than I thought was necessary. This movie has the appearance of the two witnesses, which were two of my favorite characters from the books. I felt like they made them too stereotypical, like, they just look like how everyone assumed Moses and Elijah would look (something like high priests), whereas in the books they're described as being rather minimalist in dress, not elaborate or fancy. I think in terms of acting, Janaya Stephens has a marked improvement from the first movie. She is much mature acting, and I think she really captures the Chloe from the books. The other thing I thought they nailed nearly perfectly was the scene in which Chloe is mad at Buck, and Buck waits on the porch of her house, and they have a fight, and then finally make up. It was done really well, and Kirk's and Janaya's acting skill is at its best right here. I feel like they also captured Nicolae's Satan-driven rage in the scene where Ben-Judah declares that Jesus, not Nicolae, is the Messiah. Once again, however, this movie falls a bit short because of 1) the rather cheesy special effects and 2) the 90 minute running time. They do, however, present a clear gospel story on two occasions, which is a big plus for me. There was one glaring detour from the story that I found absolutely hideous, and that is the appearance of what is assumed to be an angel when Buck and Ben-Judah are trying to get to the witnesses. She begins singing Amazing Grace, of all things, and somehow is able to distract the guards so that Buck and Tsion can get through. That is not at ALL how it happens in the book, and this movie would have greatly benefited if her scenes were just cut altogether. All in all, this movie improves a on a couple fronts, but not enough to make it a real standout. 4 of 5.Left Behind: World At War - 2004This movie deviates so thoroughly from the books, it's almost impossible to make any realistic comparisons. It's loosely based on the last 2 or 3 chapters of Trib Force, but they take the creative license through the roof. However, that is easily overlooked because of how much better this movie is made. The cinematography is superb, easily equal with the Bourne Supremacy released that same year. The special effects, explosions and what not, are excellent, especially in comparison with the other two LB movies. The focus in on the president of the U.S. who is nothing like he is in the books. In the movie he becomes a believer, and helps out the Trib Force, whereas in the books he uses obscenities every other sentence, is a total warmonger, and died unceremoniously in the Wrath of the Lamb earthquake. I think the rebellious nature, and the hatred for Carpathia that the president has is accurately portrayed, though once again they play a character that is explicitly described as being white in the books with a black actor. This doesn't bother except for the fact that it's not accurate with the books. Lou Gossett does a superb job as President Fitzhugh, and really makes this movie enjoyable with his ability to convey deep emotion and turmoil over the state of his country and the entire world. All the characters from the previous two movies return, with one glaring exception: Clarence Gilyard no longer plays Bruce. He was replaced by a younger actor, who doesn't do badly, but he is absolutely no Clarence Gilyard. That really made me sad, because he grew to be one of my favorite characters in the first two movies. Janaya Stephens one-ups herself from the previous movie again, as does almost everybody else. One thing I didn't really like was the totally abrupt introduction of Rayford's new wife Amanda at the double wedding ceremony with Rayford and Amanda, and Buck and Chloe. In the books she came on the scene long before the wedding. Overall, this movie is excellent, and really redeems this series. The end really sets you up for a 4th movie, but after eight years we still haven't gotten one. It's a shame, because these movies really on the rise in terms of quality, and I think they would have only grossed more and more at the box office had they continued. I give this third installment 4 1/2 of 5 stars.As a set of movies, I think had these been done by the Kendrick Brothers and Sherwood Pictures, they would have been absolutely awesome. But I think these three really paved the way for Sherwood to be able to compete with Hollywood with good Christian films. It is a dream of mine, as an aspiring filmmaker, to maybe someday do some remakes of these movies in collaboration with Sherwood, but until then, these movies will quench your thirst for Left Behind action on the big screen.",4,"Decent enough, all things considered",1357171200,"01 3, 2013",2013,9880,"['am', 'huge', 'fan', 'Left', 'Behind', 'books', 'are', 'masterful', 'easily', 'favorite',

I hadn't seen the third installmentLeft Behind III the World at War, as the novels and movies are not readily available in Japan where I live. So I ordered this box set to make my Left Behind DVD collection complete, as the Japanese edition of the first movie I had bought, which is disguised under the translated title 'Human Vanishings', was lost when I lent it to a friend. I was surprised to see the third one was distributed by Sony Pictures, which tells how far the series has come in terms of recognition.There was the problem of the World at War disc being an RCE, and did not play on my region free player which I bought especially to view this box set! But more of the problem was the storyline of World at War. I called these movies an 'adaptation' of the famous novels, and it seems the film-makers seemed to take a lot of 'creative freedom' in adapting the story, greatly expanding the character of the President Fitzgerald, who is not very prominent in the books. Why? The books were OK as they are, despite having many scenes of long sermons, which were necessary, and worked well in book form, but would bring the pace of a 90 minute movie way down. It seems the film-makers had a fall out with the authors of the novel, who do not regard these movies, or at least the third one (?) as an official adaptation. But I'm not sure of the details. It's kind of sad, because the first 2 did quite a good job of that.So, are there going to be more Left Behind movies? I hope so, and I hope the filmmakers and the authors (both Christians) do come to some kind of amicable agreement, to tell these great stories, and that it will give the film-makers a chance to get back on track with the novels.PS: 2-3 months after I buy this from Amazon, Sony Pictures in Japan decides to release the Japanese version after all, titled 'Human Vanishings: Final War'!

Now that they are being made into movies they see a big flashing sign screaming ""witnessing opportunity""! There was not enough budget and certainly not enough directorial skill to make this film laudable. The film's production values were undermined by the workmanship of the cameras, the lighting, the editing, and the dubious choices made by the director. All told, the effort was less than professional. When I saw the first movie in the theater, there were cheers at the end of the film. No doubt they were from those who were glad to see a Biblical prophecy and principles brought out as a first run film, without the evils of Hollywood in the way. I understand the sentiment, but fail to understand how many of the viewers could ignore the plainly painful attempts at making this film. The Passion of the Christ, it was not. People say you should not expect these films to be something so epic. Why not? These are best selling books that span 7 years and detail the supernatural events of the tribulation. In today's world, movie goers expect realism. That equals excellence. They either should have put more money into the movie to get better results or waited until they had the proper funds. Show this movie to a non-christian or review this movie as if you were going to see a ""secular"" movie. If the film is not realistic enough and wasn't put together with excellence, even if the gospel is presented beautifully, you are preaching to the choir. I will give these films one ounce of credit. Most of the actors they picked look exactly like I envisioned most of the characters and the airplane scene when people disappear is moving. Besides that the movie is quickly put together, low budget, bad acting, the 2nd movie is boring, and while the 3rd movie is 10 times better than the first two, it doesn't follow the book AT ALL. Except for using the names of the characters. It was obvious before even making a good movie, the agenda of getting the gospel message into the movie was put first.

The characters I grew to love in the books were almost one-dimensional in the movie. If you watch the special features you will see interviews with various celebrities about the movie. I wish they had made more of the story into the movie. Janaya (""Chloe"") mentioned how long everything took, but I was surprised, and had to reverse it to hear it again, to learn that it was only 6 weeks of filming. After seeing the 95 minute features I can believe it. This had so much potential, but dropped the ball. Although I must say, the actors were terrific! Everyone matched the descriptions and personalities in the books. Gordon Currie was incredible as the Antichrist! I caution you to read the books first, then watch the movies. If not, you will not appreciate the deeper meaning to them. You don't even need to be religious really, just appreciate the remarkable insights. Thank you Kirk Cameron for helping to bring the story to life, except it should have been more alive.",2,Read the books firs,1237248000,"03 17, 2009",2009,1419,"['am', 'last', '12th', 'book', 'Glorious', 'Appearing', 'having', 'devoured', 'Left', 'Behind', 'bound', 'series', 'had', 'seen', 'first', 'movie', 'Left', 'Behind', 'years', 'enjoyed', 'did', 'leave', 'hanging', 'purchased', 'books', 'read', 'same', 'time', 'purchased', '3', 'DVD', 'just', 'finished', 'watching', '3', 'movies', 'was', 'disappointed', 'script', 'somewhat', 'followed', 'books', 'then', 'World', 'War', 'went', 'off', 'own', 'world', 'characters', 'grew', 'love', 'books', 'were', 'almost', 'one-dimensional', 'movie', 'watch', 'special', 'features', 'will', 'see', 'interviews', 'various', 'celebrities', 'movie', 'wish', 'had', 'made', 'more', 'story', 'movie', 'Janaya', 'Chloe', 'mentioned', 'how', 'long', 'everything', 'took', 'was', 'surprised', 'had', 'reverse', 'hear', 'again', 'learn', 'was', 'only', '6', 'weeks', 'filming', 'seeing', '95', 'minute', 'features', 'can', 'believe', 'had', 'so', 'much', 'potential', 'dropped', 'ball', 'must', 'say', 'actors', 'were', 'terrific', 'Everyone', 'matched', 'descriptions', 'personalities', 'books', 'Gordon', 'Currie', 'was', 'incredible', 'Antichrist', 'caution', 'read', 'books', 'first', 'then', 'watch', 'movies', 'not', 'will', 'not', 'appreciate', 'deeper', 'meaning', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'need', 'be', 'religious', 'really', 'just', 'appreciate', 'remarkable', 'insights', 'Thank', 'Kirk', 'Cameron', 'helping', 'bring', 'story', 'life', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'alive']",Left Behind Collection
