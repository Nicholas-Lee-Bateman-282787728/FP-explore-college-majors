447599,A6J8D9V5S9MBE,630507982X,Curtis G,"[0, 0]","At first, I was going to launch into this brilliant diatribe about how some action movies are like porn: Most of the movie is just filler between action scenes, so you keep your finger on the fast-forward button to get to the good stuff. But a funny thing happened on the way to the review: I found that instead of fast-forwarding, I kept rewinding to see stuff again. Although ""Drive"" is an American movie, it deserves special recognition for capturing the spirit and the lightning-fast action of a true HK martial-arts film. As such, it stands head and shoulders above the steaming pile of cheesy American ""martial-arts"" straight-to-video junk.There is at least one porn parallel, however: As with porn, the plot is not important. In a nutshell, Toby Wong (Dacascos) escapes the company that ""enhanced"" him with a ""bio-engine,"" which gives him a not particularly logical excuse for his superhuman skills. He takes Malik (Hardison) hostage and forces him to drive from San Francisco to Los Angeles so Toby can sell the bio-engine to a rival company. On the way, they fight and get shot at. A lot. Works for me.Mark Dacascos was simply amazing in the role--as a martial artist, that is. I like the guy, I think he has charisma, but as an actor he just doesn't command the screen. As a fighter, however, he rocks the house (probably the only reason, besides Kelly Hu, to seeCradle 2 the Grave). Kadeem Hardison is again relegated to sidekick status (as he would be later in the made-for-TV ""Red Skies""), but it seems to be where he shines. His interaction with Dacascos, and particularly his ad-libs, were the best reason to not hit the fast-forward button. John Pyper-Ferguson continues (not disappointingly) to play his ""Briscoe County, Jr."" character, and Brittany Murphy, at her bubbly, crazy best, pops up just in time to take part in an extended garage fight scene that puts to shame every fight scene in every American-made martial-arts film ever. And I'm not just saying that because I'm drunk. With power. Would you believe that it was a Japanese stunt team (and not HK) that pulled this off?Steve Wang (""The Guyver"") directs with a sure hand. The cinematography is notable, with interesting angles, lots of camera movement and near-perfect editing. The indoor lighting could have been better, though--as it stands, the bar scenes look a little too straight-to-video, with too many reds and blues. I do have to wonder about the (original) cover picture, though: At no time in the movie does Dacascos wear jeans, and at no time does Hardison wear an afro and a mustache (instead, he sports his trademark dreadlocks and 5-day beard). Really, a movie this good deserves a better box cover. Well, I guess it's better than renting a bad movie with a good box.",4,A pleasant surprise of an action flick,1329609600,"02 19, 2012",2012,2762,"['first', 'was', 'going', 'launch', 'brilliant', 'diatribe', 'how', 'action', 'movies', 'are', 'porn', 'Most', 'movie', 'just', 'filler', 'action', 'scenes', 'keep', 'finger', 'fast-forward', 'button', 'get', 'good', 'stuff', 'funny', 'thing', 'happened', 'way', 'review', 'found', 'instead', 'fast-forwarding', 'kept', 'rewinding', 'see', 'stuff', 'again', 'Drive', 'American', 'movie', 'special', 'recognition', 'capturing', 'spirit', 'lightning-fast', 'action', 'true', 'HK', 'martial-arts', 'film', 'such', 'head', 'shoulders', 'steaming', 'pile', 'cheesy', 'American', 'martial-arts', 'straight-to-video', 'junk.There', 'least', 'one', 'porn', 'parallel', 'however', 'porn', 'plot', 'not', 'important', 'nutshell', 'Toby', 'Wong', 'Dacascos', 'company', 'enhanced', 'bio-engine', 'not', 'particularly', 'logical', 'excuse', 'superhuman', 'skills', 'Malik', 'Hardison', 'hostage', 'forces', 'drive', 'San', 'Francisco', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'Toby', 'can', 'sell', 'bio-engine', 'rival', 'company', 'way', 'fight', 'get', 'shot', 'lot', 'me.Mark', 'Dacascos', 'was', 'simply', 'amazing', 'role', 'martial', 'artist', 'guy', 'think', 'charisma', 'actor', 'just', ""n't"", 'command', 'screen', 'fighter', 'however', 'house', 'probably', 'only', 'reason', 'Kelly', 'Hu', 'seeCradle', '2', 'Grave', 'Kadeem', 'Hardison', 'again', 'relegated', 'sidekick', 'status', 'would', 'be', 'later', 'made-for-TV', 'Red', 'Skies', 'be', 'where', 'interaction', 'Dacascos', 'particularly', 'ad-libs', 'were', 'best', 'reason', 'not', 'hit', 'fast-forward', 'button', 'John', 'Pyper-Ferguson', 'not', 'disappointingly', 'play', 'Briscoe', 'County', 'Jr.', 'character', 'Brittany', 'Murphy', 'bubbly', 'crazy', 'best', 'up', 'just', 'time', 'take', 'part', 'extended', 'garage', 'fight', 'scene', 'shame', 'fight', 'scene', 'American-made', 'martial-arts', 'film', 'ever', ""'m"", 'not', 'just', 'saying', ""'m"", 'drunk', 'power', 'Would', 'believe', 'was', 'Japanese', 'stunt', 'team', 'not', 'HK', 'pulled', 'off', 'Steve', 'Wang', 'Guyver', 'sure', 'hand', 'cinematography', 'notable', 'interesting', 'angles', 'lots', 'camera', 'movement', 'near-perfect', 'editing', 'indoor', 'lighting', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'though', 'bar', 'scenes', 'look', 'little', 'too', 'straight-to-video', 'too', 'many', 'reds', 'blues', 'do', 'have', 'wonder', 'original', 'cover', 'picture', 'time', 'movie', 'Dacascos', 'wear', 'jeans', 'time', 'Hardison', 'wear', 'afro', 'mustache', 'instead', 'sports', 'trademark', 'dreadlocks', '5-day', 'beard', 'Really', 'movie', 'good', 'better', 'box', 'cover', 'Well', 'guess', 'better', 'renting', 'bad', 'movie', 'good', 'box']",Drive
447600,A38UHOCEKSUOSP,630507982X,"dominion_ruler ""Bryan""","[0, 0]","I never thought a film with simply the title of ""Drive"" would have such good martial arts action.  Yes, Mark Dacascos stars in Drive, but the choreography and intensity of the fights is unlike anything I have evr seen him do before.  Only The Strong is maybe the closest Mark gets with the Capoeira fighitng style in that movie.  In Drive, it is obvious that wires are used quite a bit, but the results are Matrix-like effects that outdo alot of the compeition such as Romeo Must Die and The One.  Mark's fighting is also combined with stunts in Drive, sometimes even resembling Jackie Chan.The story is basically a no-brainer, where the main charcater (Toby Wong - Mark Dacascos) is always on the run from the bad guys.  Once involved with a corporation in Hong Kong, Toby has fled to America carrying a high-tech piece of equipment in his chest that makes him nearly invulnerable.  The corporation wants it back, sending a fleet of men after Toby, including another super-unit, played by Masayo Kato.  While I am not familiar with him as a martial artist, his skills were quite impressive as well.Other main characters include Malik Brody played by Kadeem Hardison, who provides the comic relief throughout the film accompanied with some agression of his own.  Surprisingly, some of the humor was actually funny, for I don't expect B-action movies to make me laugh very much.  Brittany Murphy plays ""Delieverance"", another person who gets tangled up in Toby's mess in the film.  Her charcater is just silly, weird, and ditsy - running around laughing with a gun in her hand like its a game.  Oh well.Its the action that makes this movie most memorable, and makes it one of Mark Dacasco's absolute best.  Long and plenty of action scenes fill the movie, right down to the exciting final fight that is just beautiful, set in a night club.  Mark Dacascos fans will love this, and a fan of wonderful choreogprahy will love it even more.",4,far from a sunday drive,1181865600,"06 15, 2007",2007,1934,"['never', 'thought', 'film', 'simply', 'title', 'Drive', 'would', 'have', 'such', 'good', 'martial', 'arts', 'action', 'Yes', 'Mark', 'Dacascos', 'Drive', 'choreography', 'intensity', 'fights', 'anything', 'have', 'evr', 'seen', 'do', 'Only', 'Strong', 'maybe', 'closest', 'Mark', 'Capoeira', 'fighitng', 'style', 'movie', 'Drive', 'obvious', 'wires', 'are', 'used', 'quite', 'bit', 'results', 'are', 'Matrix-like', 'effects', 'outdo', 'alot', 'compeition', 'such', 'Romeo', 'Must', 'Die', 'One', 'Mark', 'fighting', 'also', 'combined', 'stunts', 'Drive', 'sometimes', 'even', 'resembling', 'Jackie', 'Chan.The', 'story', 'basically', 'no-brainer', 'where', 'main', 'charcater', 'Toby', 'Wong', 'Mark', 'Dacascos', 'always', 'run', 'bad', 'guys', 'Once', 'involved', 'corporation', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'Toby', 'fled', 'America', 'carrying', 'high-tech', 'piece', 'equipment', 'chest', 'nearly', 'invulnerable', 'corporation', 'back', 'sending', 'fleet', 'men', 'Toby', 'including', 'super-unit', 'played', 'Masayo', 'Kato', 'am', 'not', 'familiar', 'martial', 'artist', 'skills', 'were', 'quite', 'impressive', 'well.Other', 'main', 'characters', 'include', 'Malik', 'Brody', 'played', 'Kadeem', 'Hardison', 'who', 'comic', 'relief', 'film', 'accompanied', 'agression', 'own', 'Surprisingly', 'humor', 'was', 'actually', 'funny', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'B-action', 'movies', 'make', 'laugh', 'very', 'much', 'Brittany', 'Murphy', 'Delieverance', 'person', 'who', 'tangled', 'up', 'Toby', 'mess', 'film', 'charcater', 'just', 'silly', 'weird', 'ditsy', 'running', 'around', 'laughing', 'gun', 'hand', 'game', 'Oh', 'action', 'movie', 'most', 'memorable', 'one', 'Mark', 'Dacasco', 'absolute', 'best', 'Long', 'plenty', 'action', 'scenes', 'fill', 'movie', 'right', 'down', 'exciting', 'final', 'fight', 'just', 'beautiful', 'set', 'night', 'club', 'Mark', 'Dacascos', 'fans', 'will', 'love', 'fan', 'wonderful', 'choreogprahy', 'will', 'love', 'even', 'more']",Drive
447601,A3KGLF4ORJJD20,630507982X,Dragon Man X,"[29, 29]","Mark Dacascos is getting some acknowlegdement with The Brotherhood of the Wolf being released in US theatres, but Drive is by far his best film. Drive is probably the closest thing to the Matrix considering the science fiction, martial arts, and action aspect. I still feel Matrix was overall a better movie, but the martial art display of Mark Dacascos in Drive totally outshines anything Keanu ever did. Mark plays Toby Wong who is running from a powerful Red China corporation because he is carrying a special big-tech bio-weapon prototype inside his chest, which they want back. The device greatly improves his physical performance, speed and reactions and is worth millions of dollars. Kadeem Harrison who plays Malik Brody gets caught in the middle of all this and ends up being on the run with Toby. The interactions between these two are very reminincent of Rush Hour. For once, Kadeem is not that annoying and provides some good humour and Mark acts like a total foreigner. They head towards LA to find buyers that will pay 5 million dollars for the device, which Toby and Malik will split. Bunch of baddies are sent after them, and what you get is martial arts galore. Mark is in total top form here and shows probably his best stuff. This movie started off kind of pg-13ish, but the rated R violence started to show after awhile and it is such a guilty pleasure. This film is probably the first or one of the very few Hong Kong style movie that was filmed in America that was filmed right. Which version to get? The only version of Drive you should get is the Region 2 PAL version. This version is by the Hong Kong Legends distributors and is remastered (audio and video) and most importantly it is uncut. The American version, if you can find it, has approx. 16 minutes of footage taken out. What footage, I have no clue, but who wants a cut film especially if its 16 minutes of probably action footage? All I can say is that this is an awesome movie to own, and it should get more recognition. It was the winner of Minami Toshiko (critics) award at the Yubari International Fantastic Adventure Film Festival and also Winner of Best International Film Award at the 3rd Annual Fant-Asia Festival in Montreal etching out Jackie Chan's Drunken Master 2 that year. Of course, I still think Drunken Master 2 is better, but it gives you an idea how great Drive is as well. Go check it out!!!

447602,AVYCUAENA5PAO,630507982X,Erin,"[9, 10]","This movie is a Tour De Force for Mark Dacascos. You get to see him show everything that he has only shown glimpses of before. If you think Bruce Lee is fast, you haven't seen anything yet. Jet Li wishes he could be this acrobatic. Considering this is Mark's first attempt at a full fledged Hong Kong style action film, he is truly amazing not only in the fact that he pulls it off so well, but that he pulls it off better than the people who have been doing it for much longer. Even the most seasoned martial arts fan will find themselves saying wow more than once.The story centers around Mark's character, Toby Wong, escaping China and coming to America to have a biological uprgrade surgically planted in his chest remeoved. It increases the power of the person it's in. One shouldn't expect anything enlightening from the script, it's meant to be a vehicle (pun, semi intended) for showing off martial arts action. But there is a scene in the director's cut where Mark  shows his acting range. It involved Toby discussing his relationship with his girlfriend, which I won't reveal so as to not ruin things. It also succeeds in being incredibly funny, with Mark playing the straight man to Kadeem Hardison's character. The rest of the cast get's in some good lines too and if you're not a snob who expects all your movies to have subtitles and deal with subject matter that would be deemed garbage if it was the same product made in Hollywood minus the captions, then this is a movie for you.I highly recommend seeking out the versions that are uncut or have the deleted scenes and interviews. There's some extra action, but most of it involves showing the backstory on the characters as well as additionl humorous scenes. The only thing that bothers me is that the music that was in the cut version is more intersting to me. There's not much info available on the recent re-release of this movie and it appears to not have any extras. Look for the cover that show's Mark and Kadeem in a full body shot if you want the special edition.",5,Mark Dacascos at his best,1077494400,"02 23, 2004",2004,2039,"['movie', 'Tour', 'De', 'Force', 'Mark', 'Dacascos', 'get', 'see', 'show', 'everything', 'only', 'shown', 'glimpses', 'before', 'think', 'Bruce', 'Lee', 'fast', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'anything', 'yet', 'Jet', 'Li', 'could', 'be', 'acrobatic', 'Considering', 'Mark', 'first', 'attempt', 'full', 'fledged', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'style', 'action', 'film', 'truly', 'amazing', 'not', 'only', 'fact', 'off', 'so', 'well', 'off', 'better', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'doing', 'much', 'longer', 'Even', 'most', 'seasoned', 'martial', 'arts', 'fan', 'will', 'find', 'saying', 'wow', 'more', 'once.The', 'story', 'centers', 'Mark', 'character', 'Toby', 'Wong', 'escaping', 'China', 'coming', 'America', 'have', 'biological', 'uprgrade', 'surgically', 'planted', 'chest', 'remeoved', 'power', 'person', 'One', 'should', ""n't"", 'expect', 'anything', 'enlightening', 'script', 'meant', 'be', 'vehicle', 'pun', 'semi', 'intended', 'showing', 'off', 'martial', 'arts', 'action', 'scene', 'director', 'cut', 'where', 'Mark', 'acting', 'range', 'involved', 'Toby', 'discussing', 'relationship', 'girlfriend', 'wo', ""n't"", 'reveal', 'so', 'not', 'ruin', 'things', 'also', 'being', 'incredibly', 'funny', 'Mark', 'playing', 'straight', 'man', 'Kadeem', 'Hardison', 'character', 'rest', 'cast', 'get', 'good', 'lines', 'too', ""'re"", 'not', 'snob', 'who', 'movies', 'have', 'subtitles', 'deal', 'subject', 'matter', 'would', 'be', 'deemed', 'garbage', 'was', 'same', 'product', 'made', 'Hollywood', 'captions', 'then', 'movie', 'you.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'seeking', 'versions', 'are', 'uncut', 'have', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'interviews', 'extra', 'action', 'most', 'showing', 'backstory', 'characters', 'as', 'well', 'additionl', 'humorous', 'scenes', 'only', 'thing', 'bothers', 'music', 'was', 'cut', 'version', 'more', 'intersting', 'not', 'much', 'info', 'available', 'recent', 're-release', 'movie', 'not', 'have', 'extras', 'Look', 'cover', 'show', 'Mark', 'Kadeem', 'full', 'body', 'shot', 'want', 'special', 'edition']",Drive
447603,A3D3DJKKMLCRYZ,630507982X,"Erin ""skyblueboy""","[0, 0]","I have another review up under my name, Erin, but felt there was more that needed to be added. Hence, another review.There are people in the world who are not appreciated for what they've contributed and Mark Dacascos is among those who should be put in the upper echelon for his contributions to martial arts movies.Granted, Mark is partly to blame for this. Understandably, he didn't want to just be known as a martial artist and explored movies that took the focus away from that. However, in the process of doing so, he typecast himself as a B-Movie actor. It's unfair, because his talents extend beyond that.I do think that, if he had played to his strengths, he would be held in the same regard as Bruce Lee, Jackie Chan and Tony Jaa. For his fans, he already is. It's the general public I refer to.First, I want to address the comparisons to The Matrix. This movie is in no way similar to that movie. The concepts behind both movies are worlds apart and no comparisons should be drawn. A more accurate comparison might be Universal Soldier, because both deal with technology attempting to create the ultimate fighting machine, but that's a superficial comparison at best.As is par for the course with most movies, but martial arts movies in particular, the plot and story are full of holes. I don't want to reveal too much about that, because it irritates me to no end when reviewers can't tell you about a movie/game/etc without giving away the whole story.I'll just say this. The bad guys have ample opportunity to catch the good guy, but for various reasons expend their energies looking in the wrong places for him. Once you see the show, you'll understand what I mean. There are a number of other instances where common sense seems to be completely lacking and will have you questioning the intelligence of the characters.But the movie does manage to cover those issues up with some funny dialouge and, more importantly, amazing martial arts. I think some of the scenes which are lacking in common sense are a result of wanting to show off Mark's abilities. I think he set the precedent for all the martial artists these days who are employing acrobatics into their fight scences. The difference is that these people lack the speed that Mark has. Mark also has real world fight training, having power behind those lighting quick punches.Another issue I have with this movie is the use of a stunt double for Mark. This wasn't due to his inability to perform the stunts, but the amount of fighting he had to do in the time frame they had for the movie. Other people, like Jackie Chan, often take months to film one fight scene. I think they only had that much time to finish the whole movie. Considering the number of fight scense Mark had to do, it could have been completely exhausting to be involed in every scene. Although the double does a decent job, it's obvious he lacks Mark's skills.I'll say this now. I'm a big fan of Tony Jaa. I think he's taken what Mark did to the next level in some areas with the things Mark put in place. But he and his team claim Tony doesn't use springs to get the higher jumps and it's clear in the behind the scenes footage of Tony's movies that Tony does use them.But there are scenes in Drive where Mark is standing still and does an acrobatic flip over something while being in a fairly confined area. This suggests he couldn't possibly have had a spring. I could be wrong, but I just don't see how it would be possible. Basically, Mark is doing a more acrobatic jump from a still position than others do by running then jumping.There are many other instances of his incredible talents in this movie. Again, there's no way these things could have been a trick of the camera, such as running the film backwards, etc. With a little more devotion to showing off his skills, Mark would be given the recognition he deserves.If you have a region free player, there are versions in other countries that include more behind the scenes features than what's available here.

447604,ANCNEU3MD7RR,630507982X,FizzWiz,"[3, 4]","The plot of this movie allows the underrated actor, Dacascos, to truly show off what a major talent he his.  All the different body twists and turns in the movies.  He must have been particularly exhausted.  I can only imagine how many times he had to repeat those scenes.  And then a lot of his moves corresponded like a robot.  And I'd hear people rave about ""the first green ranger's"" moves, Jason David Frank, and granted he's superb at karate, but after seeing this, Dacascos is unbelieveable.  Someone on imdb even was gutsy enough to say that he was better than Jet Lee!It's ashame this movie didn't hit mainstream even though the storyline is a bit off sometimes.  The plot is meant to be weird to keep the story interesting, but when Brittany Murphy and Hardison come in to play, it is just totally off the wall.  It's so random that its supposed to be funny, but to some it will come off as just plain stupid and just put together so fast to place another character in.  Other characters who you think might be dead might not quite be, and they randomly show up.  It happens in lots of movies.  So it's not particularly eye catching to me.The disco they were at and some of the other locales really melded in with the story well.People keep saying how Dacascos should be in karate movies, but maybe a movie more like a Terminator would show another side of his acting.  His moves in this movie show that he could probably make a Terminator 4 do better thatn T3 and maybe even T1 (not T2 cause that just caught on to ""the mainstream"" like it was the thing to watch of all time).  Part of this karate thing is obviously his moves, but even within his physical features.  On the cover, he looks like say maybe Cole Hauser a bit or something like that, but then when you see the movie, it looks like he has Asian roots as well a bit.  With other Japanese characters in the movie, that only helps invigorate the karate phenomenon you see come out of watching this movie.You'd think the movie is an action movie by looking at the cover, and it is, but it is an off kilter comedy in disguise as well.",4,Mark Dacascos got skills!!,1145059200,"04 15, 2006",2006,2103,"['plot', 'movie', 'underrated', 'actor', 'Dacascos', 'truly', 'show', 'off', 'what', 'major', 'talent', 'different', 'body', 'twists', 'turns', 'movies', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'particularly', 'exhausted', 'can', 'only', 'imagine', 'how', 'many', 'times', 'had', 'repeat', 'scenes', 'then', 'lot', 'moves', 'corresponded', 'robot', ""'d"", 'hear', 'people', 'rave', 'first', 'green', 'ranger', 'moves', 'Jason', 'David', 'Frank', 'granted', 'superb', 'karate', 'seeing', 'Dacascos', 'unbelieveable', 'Someone', 'imdb', 'even', 'was', 'gutsy', 'enough', 'say', 'was', 'better', 'Jet', 'Lee', 'ashame', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'hit', 'mainstream', 'even', 'storyline', 'bit', 'off', 'sometimes', 'plot', 'meant', 'be', 'weird', 'keep', 'story', 'interesting', 'when', 'Brittany', 'Murphy', 'Hardison', 'come', 'play', 'just', 'totally', 'off', 'wall', 'so', 'random', 'supposed', 'be', 'funny', 'will', 'come', 'off', 'just', 'plain', 'stupid', 'just', 'put', 'together', 'so', 'fast', 'place', 'character', 'Other', 'characters', 'who', 'think', 'might', 'be', 'dead', 'might', 'not', 'quite', 'be', 'randomly', 'show', 'up', 'lots', 'movies', 'not', 'particularly', 'eye', 'catching', 'me.The', 'disco', 'were', 'other', 'locales', 'really', 'melded', 'story', 'well.People', 'keep', 'saying', 'how', 'Dacascos', 'should', 'be', 'karate', 'movies', 'maybe', 'movie', 'more', 'Terminator', 'would', 'show', 'side', 'acting', 'moves', 'movie', 'show', 'could', 'probably', 'make', 'Terminator', '4', 'do', 'better', 'thatn', 'T3', 'maybe', 'even', 'T1', 'not', 'T2', 'cause', 'just', 'caught', 'mainstream', 'was', 'thing', 'watch', 'time', 'Part', 'karate', 'thing', 'obviously', 'moves', 'even', 'physical', 'features', 'cover', 'say', 'maybe', 'Cole', 'Hauser', 'bit', 'something', 'then', 'when', 'see', 'movie', 'Asian', 'roots', 'as', 'well', 'bit', 'other', 'Japanese', 'characters', 'movie', 'only', 'invigorate', 'karate', 'phenomenon', 'see', 'come', 'watching', 'movie.You', ""'d"", 'think', 'movie', 'action', 'movie', 'looking', 'cover', 'off', 'kilter', 'comedy', 'disguise', 'as', 'well']",Drive

447611,A2WCRX5OQM6FED,630507982X,"Mike Sehorn ""The Phantom Projectionist""","[1, 1]","Do not call yourself a fan of Mark Dacascos if you have not seen this movie. The man who brought capoeira to Hollywood, portrayed both video game and comic book heroes, and battled zombies and a mythological monster or two didn't really come out of his martial shell until he teamed up with director Steve Wang (The Guyver 2) and ex-A Different Worldstar Kadeem Hardison, and until you see him in full action mode here, you haven't seen anything yet. His proficiency in martial arts - merely glimpsed in films likeAmerican SamuraiandCrying Freeman- come full scale in ""Drive"", making it the cumulative action package as far as Dacascos' career is concerned and definitely one of the better non-Hong Kong kung fu flicks I have seen.The story: Toby Wong (Dacascos) is a super soldier prototype on the run from his creators. Hounded by hitmen, he's forced to take struggling song-writer Malik Brody (Hardison) captive and, with his help, try to escape across America. Little does he know that if the guns-for-hire fail, his malicious creator (James Shigeta,Die Hard) has a secret weapon he will employ to retrieve his loose creation...By all means, ""Drive"" is a dumb action movie: kung fu and explosions take precedence over drama, the script is so loose that I ended up with the impression that the open-ended climax wasn't intentional but that the filmmakers simply realized they had to end the movie at some time and this was as good a place as any. Nevertheless, the film is very aware of its genre and doesn't bother trying to appear very intelligent or overly important - it's merely fun for fun's sake, and great fun at that. The action isn't watered down with unnecessary editing or CGI, the storyline's pace is free-spirited rather than sloppy, and the characters are colorful despite not being especially defined - particularly demonstrated by the Tarantino-esque bounty hunter John Pyper-Ferguson (Black Dawn) and the delightfully insane Brittany Murphy (8 Mile).Indeed, though he's obligated to fill the 'funny black guy' stereotype, Kadeem Hardison proves himself a legitimate comedy actor and saves Mark Dacascos thematically as much as much as Dacascos saves him within the plot. In this sense, the two are a great duo: Hardison talks the talk while Dacascos beats the snot out of people in ways that rival Jackie Chan and Jet Li. There are six fights within the movie, two of which exceed five minutes in length and all of which are fast-paced and filled with plenty of jumping kicks, sweeps, weapons, and utilization of the environment to make the brawls more interesting. The action content culminates with a one-two encounter in a club wherein Dacascos takes on attackers on motorcycles before squaring off against an advanced soldier model (Masaya Kato,Brother) in a fight that most definitely influenced the battles ofThe Matrix. Despite the frequent presence of an obvious stunt double, Mark still shines by taking full advantage of being given carte blanche to show off his abilities. These fights are eye-openers.Shot for under $3 million, ""Drive"" is an excellent example of how very good direct-to-video cinema can be when an effort is made. Other than a single obvious green screen explosion, there are absolutely no indications that this movie was made cheaply. I can honestly say that this may very well be the single best film Mark has ever starred in, and both devotees and kung fu fans in general ought not be without this movie under any circumstances. Yes, I know it may cost more than the average DVD, but don't let this deter you - it's 100% worth it.",5,The Drive Of A Lifetime,1245715200,"06 23, 2009",2009,3583,"['Do', 'not', 'call', 'fan', 'Mark', 'Dacascos', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'movie', 'man', 'who', 'brought', 'capoeira', 'Hollywood', 'portrayed', 'video', 'game', 'comic', 'book', 'heroes', 'battled', 'zombies', 'mythological', 'monster', 'two', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'come', 'martial', 'shell', 'teamed', 'up', 'director', 'Steve', 'Wang', 'Guyver', '2', 'ex-A', 'Different', 'Worldstar', 'Kadeem', 'Hardison', 'see', 'full', 'action', 'mode', 'here', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'anything', 'yet', 'proficiency', 'martial', 'arts', 'merely', 'glimpsed', 'films', 'likeAmerican', 'SamuraiandCrying', 'Freeman-', 'come', 'full', 'scale', 'Drive', 'making', 'cumulative', 'action', 'package', 'as', 'far', 'Dacascos', 'career', 'concerned', 'definitely', 'one', 'better', 'non-Hong', 'Kong', 'kung', 'fu', 'flicks', 'have', 'seen.The', 'story', 'Toby', 'Wong', 'Dacascos', 'super', 'soldier', 'prototype', 'run', 'creators', 'Hounded', 'hitmen', 'forced', 'take', 'struggling', 'song-writer', 'Malik', 'Brody', 'Hardison', 'captive', 'help', 'try', 'escape', 'America', 'Little', 'know', 'guns-for-hire', 'fail', 'malicious', 'creator', 'James', 'Shigeta', 'Die', 'Hard', 'secret', 'weapon', 'will', 'employ', 'retrieve', 'loose', 'creation', 'means', 'Drive', 'dumb', 'action', 'movie', 'kung', 'fu', 'explosions', 'take', 'precedence', 'drama', 'script', 'so', 'loose', 'ended', 'up', 'impression', 'open-ended', 'climax', 'was', ""n't"", 'intentional', 'filmmakers', 'simply', 'realized', 'had', 'end', 'movie', 'time', 'was', 'as', 'good', 'place', 'Nevertheless', 'film', 'very', 'aware', 'genre', ""n't"", 'bother', 'trying', 'appear', 'very', 'intelligent', 'overly', 'important', 'merely', 'fun', 'fun', 'sake', 'great', 'fun', 'action', ""n't"", 'watered', 'down', 'unnecessary', 'editing', 'CGI', 'storyline', 'pace', 'free-spirited', 'rather', 'sloppy', 'characters', 'are', 'colorful', 'not', 'being', 'especially', 'defined', 'particularly', 'demonstrated', 'Tarantino-esque', 'bounty', 'hunter', 'John', 'Pyper-Ferguson', 'Black', 'Dawn', 'delightfully', 'insane', 'Brittany', 'Murphy', '8', 'Mile', '.Indeed', 'obligated', 'fill', ""'funny"", 'black', 'guy', 'stereotype', 'Kadeem', 'Hardison', 'legitimate', 'comedy', 'actor', 'Mark', 'Dacascos', 'thematically', 'as', 'much', 'as', 'much', 'Dacascos', 'plot', 'sense', 'two', 'are', 'great', 'duo', 'Hardison', 'talk', 'Dacascos', 'snot', 'people', 'ways', 'rival', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'Jet', 'Li', 'are', 'six', 'fights', 'movie', 'two', 'exceed', 'five', 'minutes', 'length', 'are', 'fast-paced', 'filled', 'plenty', 'jumping', 'kicks', 'sweeps', 'weapons', 'utilization', 'environment', 'make', 'brawls', 'more', 'interesting', 'action', 'content', 'one-two', 'encounter', 'club', 'wherein', 'Dacascos', 'attackers', 'motorcycles', 'squaring', 'off', 'advanced', 'soldier', 'model', 'Masaya', 'Kato', 'Brother', 'fight', 'most', 'definitely', 'influenced', 'battles', 'ofThe', 'Matrix', 'frequent', 'presence', 'obvious', 'stunt', 'double', 'Mark', 'still', 'taking', 'full', 'advantage', 'being', 'given', 'carte', 'blanche', 'show', 'off', 'abilities', 'fights', 'are', 'eye-openers.Shot', '3', 'million', 'Drive', 'excellent', 'example', 'how', 'very', 'good', 'direct-to-video', 'cinema', 'can', 'be', 'when', 'effort', 'made', 'Other', 'single', 'obvious', 'green', 'screen', 'explosion', 'are', 'absolutely', 'indications', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'cheaply', 'can', 'honestly', 'say', 'may', 'very', 'well', 'be', 'single', 'best', 'film', 'Mark', 'ever', 'starred', 'devotees', 'kung', 'fu', 'fans', 'general', 'ought', 'not', 'be', 'movie', 'circumstances', 'Yes', 'know', 'may', 'cost', 'more', 'average', 'DVD', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'deter', '100', '%']",Drive

But the movie even in the 95 or so minute version is still very good.  It does feel like it was taken straightt form tv, but still one of the best tv movies ever.  Mark dacoscas gets his real starring role in this one.  And you will find out that this guy is a true martial arts master.  His athletic ability is uncomparable to other actors.  He has that somerican looking face, I don't see why he can't do more roles like this, it is sad.Now the movie itself, starts out showing you that you will be seeing at least one super human in this movie.  So the guy from speed(and speed 2), gets taken hoistage sort of just because he is around and has a car.  While the movie never really gets going with a great storyline, it doesn't need to.  The action just absolutely explodes.  And the storyline is good, it's just that it could have been a bit deeper, but the comedy was outstanding.  There is a part where the 2 get pulled over, black guy pulls out his licence, all is good.  The cop asks for dacascas's name and he tells him ""Sammo Hung"".  I was not expecting that and it had me rolling.  So certainly a 5 for the action and probably a 3.5 for the story.  With a 4 for the acting.  And the music was around a 4 too, very good.Now the concept in this is kind of like a classic kung uf movie, guns, but not really allowed to use them.  In enter the dragon, they were not allowed on the island, in other movies, it can just be an honor thing.  But the reason behind it in this is the fact that dacoscas is a super weapon  in the near future and he has a certain device implanted in his chest and is worth too much money to kill.  So they have to try and shoot him in the legs.  This showcases mark to his full capabilites.

It ranks up with ONLY THE STRONG, REDEMPTION: KICKBOXER 5, and BROTHERHOOD OF THE WOLF as Mark's one of, if not the best of Mark's films.DRIVE is often compared to Jackie Chan's RUSH HOUR. While it's clear that DRIVE is greatly influenced by Jackie Chan's Hong Kong pics, I found it more comparable to CHILL FACTOR.The story begins as our hero Toby Wong (Mark Dacascos) arrives in San Francisco from Hong Kong, attempting to escape his slavery to a Hong Kong assassin ring. He has a ""bio-engine"" inside his chest that greatly inhances his physicality, and has learned that he can earn $5 million from an American coporation to is interested in buying the chip. Naturally, Wong's superiors don't want this, and have sent some goons after him. Wong kidnaps Malik Brody (Kadeem Hardison) to DRIVE him to L.A., and insures Malik's cooperation by offering a 50% cut.DRIVE takes the best parts of Jackie Chan's movies and shows them to an American audience. For example, The lengthy brawl in the motel garage I found reminiscent of the auto-test center finale in TWIN DRAGONS. Also, the excellent final match between Mark and Masaya Kato follows the Jackie Chan tradition of the fighters being so evenly matched that their duel goes back and forth to the point where you just don't know who will win.Even Mark plowing an opponent down on a Motorcycle is something of a tradition in kung fu movies (it's been seen in POLICE STORY, RAPID FIRE, IN THE LINE OF DUTY IV,etc.)And the comedy in DRIVE in every way matches the action, so do yourself a favor, and check out DRIVE for Kadeem Hardison's comedy and Mark Dacascos' FISTS OF FURY.",5,Where's the party at?,1109289600,"02 25, 2005",2005,1776,"['have', 'ever', 'seen', 'Mark', 'Dacascos', 'villanous', 'role', 'CRADLE', '2', 'THE', 'GRAVE', 'then', 'DRIVE', 'as', 'good', 'place', 'see', 'hero', 'up', 'ONLY', 'THE', 'STRONG', 'REDEMPTION', 'KICKBOXER', '5', 'BROTHERHOOD', 'THE', 'WOLF', 'Mark', 'one', 'not', 'best', 'Mark', 'films.DRIVE', 'often', 'compared', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'RUSH', 'HOUR', 'clear', 'DRIVE', 'greatly', 'influenced', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'pics', 'found', 'more', 'comparable', 'CHILL', 'FACTOR.The', 'story', 'hero', 'Toby', 'Wong', 'Mark', 'Dacascos', 'San', 'Francisco', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'attempting', 'escape', 'slavery', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'assassin', 'ring', 'bio-engine', 'chest', 'greatly', 'physicality', 'learned', 'can', 'earn', '5', 'million', 'American', 'coporation', 'interested', 'buying', 'chip', 'Naturally', 'Wong', 'superiors', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'have', 'sent', 'goons', 'Wong', 'Malik', 'Brody', 'Kadeem', 'Hardison', 'DRIVE', 'L.A.', 'Malik', 'cooperation', 'offering', '50', '%', 'cut.DRIVE', 'best', 'parts', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'movies', 'American', 'audience', 'example', 'lengthy', 'brawl', 'motel', 'garage', 'found', 'reminiscent', 'auto-test', 'center', 'finale', 'TWIN', 'DRAGONS', 'Also', 'excellent', 'final', 'match', 'Mark', 'Masaya', 'Kato', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'tradition', 'fighters', 'being', 'so', 'evenly', 'matched', 'duel', 'back', 'forth', 'point', 'where', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'who', 'will', 'win.Even', 'Mark', 'plowing', 'opponent', 'down', 'Motorcycle', 'something', 'tradition', 'kung', 'fu', 'movies', 'been', 'seen', 'POLICE', 'STORY', 'RAPID', 'FIRE', 'IN', 'THE', 'LINE', 'OF', 'DUTY', 'IV', 'etc', 'comedy', 'DRIVE', 'way', 'action', 'so', 'do', 'favor', 'check', 'out', 'DRIVE', 'Kadeem', 'Hardison', 'comedy', 'Mark', 'Dacascos', 'FISTS', 'OF', 'FURY']",Drive

Kadeem Hardison (&quot;Dwayne Wayne&quot;) lends support as the comic sidekick, and does a good job. Brittany Murphy (Clueless) is pretty much wasted in her role as a wacky teen, but runs with her material as far as it will carry her (and damn, is she hot while she does that!). John-Pyper Ferguson should be happy he didn't sustain permanent damage to his jaw for chewing the scenery so much, but it fits in with the film.The real stars of this movie (apart from Dacascos, who is an impressive martial artist) are director Steve Wang, who has a firm grasp on the proceedings, and action director Koichi Sakamoto, who stages several hand-to-hand coflicts.
