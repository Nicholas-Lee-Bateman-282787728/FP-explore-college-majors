472425,A2GXS2YPSKW2SF,6305668353,alex,"[0, 0]","Originally released in 1999 by now deceased director Satoshi Kon, Perfect Blue managed to offer a unique animated movie experience that creates as many questions as it does answers. One thing is for certain though; any anime fan, or fans of movies in general should give this a watch, as they might not have seen anything quite like it.The film begins with 20 year old Mima Kirigue performing a concert as part of a band known as CHAM. They have a small but loyal fan base and are wholesome and innocent. However, Mima has aspirations to become whats known as an idol in Japan - famous celebrities who sing, dance, model and voice act - whilst also providing a role model to young girls in Japan. Unfortunately, many don't make it to public stardom, like Mima's band CHAM. Therefore, Mima decides to leave the band in pursuit of becoming an actor. However, Mima soon discovers that shedding her innocent image is whats required for her to be taken seriously as an actress, and soon she finds herself agreeing to be part of a rape scene in a television series. It's here that the psychological aspect comes into play; Mima begins to be stalked by a mysterious figure; she begins to dream about murder and starts to hallucinate, Gradually her psyche begins to deteriorate and we the viewers start to fall apart with her as the lines between fantasy and reality become increasingly blurry.That is the premise for the film, though in words it doesn't seem to have the same impact as actually watching viewing it. Many viewers when viewing will say "" Ah, so this part she imagined!"" or ""That's part of the movie she is in"" etc. Only for Satoshi Kon to add another layer of mystery onto what already feels like a substantial amount of mind twisting. But that is what makes this film a great one - there's something to really bite into, to ponder and speculate about that not many movies make viewers do nowadays. It provides a satisfying ending that helps to clear away some of the fog that the film accumulates. Granted, it may not be for everyone, due to the graphic violence and nudity that the film shows,and also may isolate some fans due to a few confusing scenes, but ultimately it is one i recommend highly to everyone interested.It should be mentioned though - if you don't like movies that ""mess with your head"" so to speak, then you may not enjoy Perfect Blue. If there is one thing this move excels at, then it is creating a seamless blend of fantasy and reality, often to the point where it becomes difficult to differentiate between the two. This method of directing can often get confusing, but it is not down to poor directing but due to masterful directing by Kon.It was his intention to make the viewers scratch their heads; to probe deeper and come to their own conclusion. For some, the lack of outright answers may frustrate, but I promise if the film is re-watched multiple times, then the viewer will come away every time with a new discovery made. Therefore, it is also great value for money (if you can find a cheap copy, as the ones of Amazon are pricey due to being out of print).PS: It should be mentioned that I viewed the uncut blu ray edition that has yet to be released in America. However, a release date for the Perfect Blue Blu ray has been announced for Europe in October 2013.

Although Mima knows that the website must be run by an impostor (after all, if the 'real' Mima was the website author, then she would know that...wouldn't she?), she becomes increasingly confused and concerned when the most private details of her life are posted for all to see - private details that most people would have no knowledge of.And as Mima struggles with her acting career and is forced to make difficult choices in 'how far' she is willing to go to further her career (including a difficult 'adult' acting scene), she becomes increasingly disassociated from reality and cannot seem to tear herself away from ""Mima's Room"", where the perfect 'Mima' there seems so much larger than life than the 'real' Mima. And what of her various colleagues who keep meeting with serious injuries, accidents, and outright murder? Are the scenes - increasingly violent - that Mima is acting on stage just acting...or is it reality, edited into a TV show in order for her to cope?This particular director, also involved (I believe) withMillennium ActressandPaprika, is a master at blending reality with fantasy (dreams and/or movies) in such a way that you can never be quite sure which is the fantasy and which is the reality. This thriller movie will mess with the viewer's mind, as we wonder what the nature of Mima's life truly is, and whether she is an innocent victim or a crazed psychopath.

472442,A1AISPOIIHTHXX,6305668353,"Cloud ""...""","[1, 2]","Perfect Blue, directed by Satoshi Kon who would later do Millenium Actress, Tokyo Godfathers and the upcoming Paprika, takes a stab (no pun intended) at a more mature offering. Instead of having things such as mechs or special abilities or fighters who can fly 60 feet in the air, this is more like a traditional movie only done in animation. With some interesting, surrealistic visuals, an ever-shifting storyline and lots of twists Lost would be proud to have, this is a film for those looking for that little extra something in their anime movies.Mima Kirogue is a pop singer for the band CHAM! Like all pop singers who dream of being known for something else as well as the brevity of most careers, she quits and pursues an acting career. Some fans are not happy with this decision and one in particular is quite obsessed with Mima returning to her old career, even going as far as to follow her and impersonate her online as well as going to extremes involving people working with Mima. But is it the stalker or is something else entirely going on?What's really great ultimately about the story is its comfortable sense of pacing. Anyone who's a fan of film noir or the often used comparison to Hitchcock films knows pacing is very deliberate. Rather than have the slam-bang pace of a lot of anime films, here thinks start out quietly and strangely calm but soon things escalate and more and more things start to happen around Mima. It's a film that can probably work in live action but animation just gives it that extra surreal quality, especially the constant presence of someone in the mirror and their manner of moving which would look silly filmed.The other is the story. The film very sneakily has so many elements and layers on it that you'll find yourself constantly figuring out the mystery only to have it not be the case. While at times it's incredibly hard to keep track of everything and what's in the mind and what's for real constantly shifts making you lose an understanding of what's going on only to be shown the answer later. You got to walk into this film prepared to challenge everything although the fun of it is seeing it unfold with you confused in a good way. Kon's style of animation at times can be somewhat distracting. While there's a lot of more cinematic elements used such as blurring or rotating camera movement, the characters look slightly ugly at times.It may not be the most loved anime by most people with some calling it overrated or just plain weird for anything but I quite enjoyed it and you should check it out.",5,Against the norm in a good way,1181692800,"06 13, 2007",2007,2560,"['Perfect', 'Blue', 'directed', 'Satoshi', 'Kon', 'who', 'would', 'later', 'do', 'Millenium', 'Actress', 'Tokyo', 'Godfathers', 'upcoming', 'Paprika', 'stab', 'pun', 'intended', 'more', 'mature', 'offering', 'Instead', 'having', 'things', 'such', 'mechs', 'special', 'abilities', 'fighters', 'who', 'can', 'fly', '60', 'feet', 'air', 'more', 'traditional', 'movie', 'only', 'done', 'animation', 'interesting', 'surrealistic', 'visuals', 'ever-shifting', 'storyline', 'lots', 'twists', 'Lost', 'would', 'be', 'proud', 'have', 'film', 'looking', 'little', 'extra', 'something', 'anime', 'movies.Mima', 'Kirogue', 'pop', 'singer', 'band', 'CHAM', 'pop', 'singers', 'who', 'dream', 'being', 'known', 'something', 'else', 'as', 'well', 'brevity', 'most', 'careers', 'acting', 'career', 'fans', 'are', 'not', 'happy', 'decision', 'one', 'particular', 'quite', 'obsessed', 'Mima', 'returning', 'old', 'career', 'even', 'going', 'as', 'far', 'follow', 'impersonate', 'online', 'as', 'well', 'going', 'extremes', 'involving', 'people', 'working', 'Mima', 'stalker', 'something', 'else', 'entirely', 'going', 'What', 'really', 'great', 'ultimately', 'story', 'comfortable', 'sense', 'pacing', 'Anyone', 'who', 'fan', 'film', 'noir', 'often', 'used', 'comparison', 'Hitchcock', 'films', 'pacing', 'very', 'deliberate', 'Rather', 'have', 'slam-bang', 'pace', 'lot', 'anime', 'films', 'here', 'start', 'out', 'quietly', 'strangely', 'calm', 'soon', 'things', 'escalate', 'more', 'more', 'things', 'start', 'happen', 'around', 'Mima', 'film', 'can', 'probably', 'work', 'live', 'action', 'animation', 'just', 'extra', 'surreal', 'quality', 'especially', 'constant', 'presence', 'someone', 'mirror', 'manner', 'moving', 'would', 'look', 'silly', 'filmed.The', 'other', 'story', 'film', 'very', 'sneakily', 'so', 'many', 'elements', 'layers', ""'ll"", 'find', 'constantly', 'figuring', 'out', 'mystery', 'only', 'have', 'not', 'be', 'case', 'times', 'incredibly', 'hard', 'keep', 'track', 'everything', 'what', 'mind', 'what', 'real', 'constantly', 'shifts', 'making', 'lose', 'understanding', 'what', 'going', 'only', 'be', 'shown', 'answer', 'later', 'got', 'walk', 'film', 'prepared', 'challenge', 'everything', 'fun', 'seeing', 'unfold', 'confused', 'good', 'way', 'Kon', 'style', 'animation', 'times', 'can', 'be', 'somewhat', 'distracting', 'lot', 'more', 'cinematic', 'elements', 'used', 'such', 'blurring', 'rotating', 'camera', 'movement', 'characters', 'look', 'slightly', 'ugly', 'times.It', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'most', 'loved', 'anime', 'most', 'people', 'calling', 'overrated', 'just', 'plain', 'weird', 'anything', 'quite', 'enjoyed', 'should', 'check', 'out']",Perfect Blue rated edition  VHS
472443,A2P49WD75WHAG5,6305668353,Daniel J. Hamlow,"[53, 56]","Anime can fall into apocalyptic (Akira), cutesy heroine (Sailor Moon), hentai (LA Blue Girl), samurai (Ninja Scroll), or mechanistic (Neon Evangelion).  Perfect Blue is notable in that it does not fit in any of those well-trod genres.After two and a half years of being lead singer with the techno-pop trio Cham, 21-year old Mima Kigiroe announces at a concert that she is leaving the group to pursue a movie career.  One of the other members puts it more colourfully, that Mima has graduated from Cham.  The move stuns her fans, but Mima sees her time there as wonderful, but felt suffocated by the innocent pop-idol image and that it was time to move on to newer things, such as her role in Double Bind, a psycho-thriller drama series where she plays the sister of a victim.  Tadokoro feels that there's ""no place for pop idols to appeal to the masses.""  Acting in this drama will be Mima's ""make it or break it"" opportunity.Upon the insistence of her agent Tadokoro to Shibuya, the scriptwriter, and the producer(?) Tejima, her role gradually increases, from the line ""Who are you?"" to something drastic, involving a traumatic scene Jodie Foster did in The Accused, only it's the stage of a strip club and not on a pool table.  Besides, it's simulated anyway.  This does indeed change Mima's image, but Rumi Hidaka, her other agent and former pop idol, is upset and even leaves during that scene.Mima has other problems.  She comes across a website called Mima's Room, which initially causes her amusement, as it details an imagined day in her life, ""Someone sures knows me""--but when she reads some things that actually happened, she gets scared.Mima is then confronted not only with those things, but with a version of herself as she was as Cham's lead singer, wearing her Cham dress.  This ""old"" version insists HERSELF as is the real Mima, which makes the real and ""new"" Mima an impostor.  There's also a sinister stalker, a mysterious hunchback with bad teeth that she notices and sees during her shooting scenes.Meanwhile, people associated with promoting Mima's new career move are getting brutally murdered, such as a photographer who took some nude photos of Mima for a magazine.  For an anime, there is some detail in the photos shown that would not ordinarily be seen even in anime of this kind.There is one puzzling aspect.  Despite having a fervent following, it seems inconsistent that Cham never hit the charts, yet when Mima leaves, we learn that Cham debuted in the Japanese pop charts for the first time.  Normally, when a key member leaves a well-loved group, a new sound and sliding sales result, (q.v. Spice Girls, Bananarama).  Trivia:  the fax Mima receives reads ""uragiri"", which indeed does mean traitor.Most of it is influenced by Hitchcock's Psycho, but the violence of the murders recall Basic Instinct and Scream.  Then there's the blurring between reality and delusion explored in Vertigo (Hitchcock again) and Alejandro Amenebar's Abre Los Ojos.  Double Bind is similar to Silence Of The Lambs (modus operandus of the killer).  The upbeat techno-pop and a trio becoming a duo also mirrors Bananarama, although the music is more Pet Shop Boys during their Very period.  Then there's the usual lead singer leaving the group for individual fame and more money, as was the case for Peter Cetera and Bobby Brown.  And one need look no further than John Lennon and Rebecca Schaffer in terms of demented stalker fans.  These influences entwine themselves to yield an exceptional thriller, with a likeable heroine (Mima) to root for, as she grows despite her traumatic experiences.",4,Effective Hitchcockian psycho-thriller anime,1061337600,"08 20, 2003",2003,3607,"['Anime', 'can', 'fall', 'apocalyptic', 'Akira', 'cutesy', 'heroine', 'Sailor', 'Moon', 'hentai', 'LA', 'Blue', 'Girl', 'samurai', 'Ninja', 'Scroll', 'mechanistic', 'Neon', 'Evangelion', 'Perfect', 'Blue', 'notable', 'not', 'fit', 'well-trod', 'genres.After', 'two', 'half', 'years', 'being', 'lead', 'singer', 'techno-pop', 'trio', 'Cham', '21-year', 'old', 'Mima', 'Kigiroe', 'announces', 'concert', 'leaving', 'group', 'pursue', 'movie', 'career', 'One', 'other', 'members', 'more', 'colourfully', 'Mima', 'graduated', 'Cham', 'move', 'fans', 'Mima', 'time', 'wonderful', 'felt', 'suffocated', 'innocent', 'pop-idol', 'image', 'was', 'time', 'move', 'newer', 'things', 'such', 'role', 'Double', 'Bind', 'psycho-thriller', 'drama', 'series', 'where', 'sister', 'victim', 'Tadokoro', 'place', 'pop', 'idols', 'appeal', 'masses', 'Acting', 'drama', 'will', 'be', 'Mima', 'make', 'break', 'insistence', 'agent', 'Tadokoro', 'Shibuya', 'scriptwriter', 'producer', 'Tejima', 'role', 'gradually', 'line', 'Who', 'are', 'something', 'drastic', 'involving', 'traumatic', 'scene', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'did', 'Accused', 'only', 'stage', 'strip', 'club', 'not', 'pool', 'table', 'simulated', 'anyway', 'indeed', 'change', 'Mima', 'image', 'Rumi', 'Hidaka', 'other', 'agent', 'former', 'pop', 'idol', 'upset', 'even', 'leaves', 'scene.Mima', 'other', 'problems', 'website', 'called', 'Mima', 'Room', 'initially', 'amusement', 'details', 'imagined', 'day', 'life', 'Someone', 'when', 'things', 'actually', 'happened', 'then', 'confronted', 'not', 'only', 'things', 'version', 'herself', 'was', 'Cham', 'lead', 'singer', 'wearing', 'Cham', 'dress', 'old', 'version', 'HERSELF', 'real', 'Mima', 'real', 'new', 'Mima', 'impostor', 'also', 'sinister', 'stalker', 'mysterious', 'hunchback', 'bad', 'teeth', 'notices', 'sees', 'shooting', 'scenes.Meanwhile', 'people', 'associated', 'promoting', 'Mima', 'new', 'career', 'move', 'are', 'getting', 'brutally', 'murdered', 'such', 'photographer', 'who', 'took', 'nude', 'photos', 'Mima', 'magazine', 'anime', 'detail', 'photos', 'shown', 'would', 'not', 'ordinarily', 'be', 'seen', 'even', 'anime', 'one', 'puzzling', 'aspect', 'having', 'fervent', 'following', 'inconsistent', 'Cham', 'never', 'hit', 'charts', 'yet', 'when', 'Mima', 'learn', 'Cham', 'debuted', 'Japanese', 'pop', 'charts', 'first', 'time', 'Normally', 'when', 'key', 'member', 'well-loved', 'group', 'new', 'sound', 'sliding', 'sales', 'result', 'q.v', 'Spice', 'Girls', 'Bananarama', 'Trivia', 'fax', 'Mima', 'uragiri', 'indeed', 'mean', 'traitor.Most', 'influenced', 'Hitchcock', 'Psycho', 'violence', 'murders', 'recall', 'Basic', 'Instinct', 'Scream', 'Then', 'blurring', 'reality', 'delusion', 'explored', 'Vertigo', 'Hitchcock', 'again', 'Alejandro', 'Amenebar', 'Abre', 'Los', 'Ojos', 'Double', 'Bind', 'similar', 'Silence', 'Lambs', 'modus', 'operandus', 'killer', 'upbeat', 'techno-pop', 'trio', 'becoming', 'duo', 'also', 'mirrors', 'Bananarama', 'music', 'more', 'Pet', 'Shop', 'Boys', 'Very', 'period', 'Then', 'usual', 'lead', 'singer', 'leaving', 'group', 'individual', 'fame', 'more', 'money', 'was', 'case', 'Peter', 'Cetera', 'Bobby', 'Brown', 'one', 'need', 'look', 'further', 'John', 'Lennon', 'Rebecca', 'Schaffer', 'terms', 'demented', 'stalker', 'fans', 'influences', 'entwine', 'yield', 'exceptional', 'thriller', 'likeable', 'heroine', 'Mima', 'root', 'traumatic', 'experiences']",Perfect Blue rated edition  VHS

It just slowly destroys your perceptions of reality, leaving you clueless as to where you are or what's really going on. Danger is always present and there is no where to hide. The story for 'Perfect Blue' is convoluted, at best, but this is precisely the point. You never quite know what's real or not. Not since Roman Polanski's 'Repulsion' have I believed a character's slow progression into madness as I have Mima Kirigoe's, the central character of the film. The violence is heavy-handed and the film pulls no punches in it's depiction of sexuality, but whereas most films would be considered exploitative for this, 'Perfect Blue' is simply pushing you ever closer to reality. An animated film such as this truely makes you forget that you're not watching 'real' actors and actresses up there on the screen. Everything... from it's super-glossy yet gritty presentation, it's mind-warping screenplay, it's eratic score... everything just clicks. Not since 'Akira' has an animated film got me so involved in the lives of it's characters. It also contains one of the most disturbing conclusions ever seen on the screen... period.

472451,A2CCWUHE0Q4G1M,6305668353,Doran Steele,"[5, 7]","I had heard a lot about the film Perfect Blue, so I thought I would give it a try.  I have been trying to watch the ""best of anime"" and this is one that keeps appearing on the lists.  Here are my impressions...The narrative of the film consists of multiple layers of reality and is fairly confusing.  I do not intend to spoil the plot, but I would like to give a sense of where the confusing elements come from.  The story centers around a young pop star named Mima would wants to change careers in order to be an actress.  Once she makes the transition she find that the television producers don't have any faith in her acting skills, but want to exploit her good looks and her fame, so they cast her in a degrading, exploitative role where she has to film an explicit rape scene.  Her management also insists that she goes on a risqu&eacute; photo shoot, and otherwise exploit her at the lowest possible level.  The film at times will switch without warning between Mima's real life and the television drama that she appears in.  This becomes complex as events in both worlds start mirroring each other-dialogue in the drama seems to reflect events in her life and so forth.  Besides the switching, this is pretty clear so far, right?  Then there is another character in the film who is suffering from split personality disorder and at times this character believes that she is Mima.  The film switches between the point of view of the two characters without telling you when it makes the switch.  This becomes especially complex since the mentally ill character will at times hallucinate and have difficulty distinguishing fantasy from reality.  People from reality appear in the delusions of the mentally ill character as facets of her personality.  This troubled, mentally ill character then tries to work through her problems by pitting the various facets of her personality against each other.  So when you watch a scene you have to wonder whether it is ""really"" happening or whether it is simply a delusional fantasy of the mentally ill character.  Then there is the crazy, obsessed fan who tries in a sense to become Mima by posting an online diary where he pretends to be Mima and writes about intimate details of her day from what he alleges to be her point of view.  Mima discovers the diary and becomes disturbed and frightened both by the level of detail and by the interpretations that this diary writer makes about daily events in her life.  OK, so this already confusing since there are two other characters trying to take over the life of the main character.  But maybe that's not it at all.  Maybe there is no distinction between fantasy and reality.  Maybe there is no sane world in this film.  Maybe there is no television drama.  And maybe there is no real Mima, or at least no real Mima in the film.  Perhaps all of the characters are multiple personalities of the main character and the other two characters trying to steal Mima's life are really personalities trying to emerge and become the dominant personality.  At any rate the film is a mix of all of these different elements-the delusions, the Mima's crime drama, ""reality.""  Watch the film for yourself to figure out what you believe is going on.Some of you may be complaining at this point that I just spoiled the entire film.  Not quite.  As may other reviewers have suggested, this film is best understood after multiple viewings.  The film is filled with so many plot twists and multiple layers that it becomes difficult to keep them all straight.  Perhaps it is true that the film becomes more clear with multiple viewings.  I have to say that I have seen Perfect Blue once and that's enough for me.  The film is an entry in the ""shocking, sexually-charged thriller"" genre that was quite popular in Hollywood in the late eighties and early nineties.  Perfect Blue missed the peak of that genre by a fair number of years.  By now this genre seems overexposed and tired.  The film certainly is shocking--explicit rape scenes, graphic eyeball gouging, blood splattered everywhere--but hasn't this been done a thousand times before?  Once we've been shocked, it become increasingly more difficult to make things shocking.  Perfect Blue attempts to raise the bar of shocking content, but ends up delivering scenes that are distasteful, but not really as shocking as they were intended to be.  In comparison to this film, Hitchcock's shower murder scene in Psycho was a masterpiece of subtlety and restraint.  Perfect Blue does have a few moments where the viewer discovers that scenes in the film may have really meant something completely different than we were originally lead to believe.  These scenes are effective and deliver more shocks than the graphic violence.Bottom line:  This film is definitely not for children or for people who have had their fill of thrillers in the style of those starring Michael Douglas.  I'm not a fan of that genre, but someone who is may enjoy this film.  Perfect Blue does offer the viewer the same kind of puzzling, multilayered narrative structure that we all know and love from Existenz, Vanilla Sky, and a multitude of other films.",3,"Somewhat

This movie is a psycho thriller that places emphasis on what is real, what isn't, what's a dream.  The main character Mima is a pop-idol, until she makes a huge career change and becomes a small time actress.  She later lands a large role in a series.  This move upsets some people.  She also becomes aware of a website called Mima's Room that list out her daily events, such things as the foot she used to step into the bathtub and the milk she buys, the words she has said during the day.  This webpage becomes a focus as Mima visits it day after day, but soon the Mima in the web page becomes angry.  Mima's pop-idol personality starts to haunt her, calling her dirty or contaminated, claiming that Mima the actress is not the real Mima at all... Soon Mima starts to believe all this.  The story starts to take twists as murders pop up, a mysterious figure keeps showing itself and flashings between fantasy and the real world become more frequent and we lose the ability to determine which is which as scenes are repeated slightly different.It's a good movie diving into the mind of Mima, showing us her struggle to claim her identity as an actress, a person who is mature with their own goals and paths for life.I came up with a better ending, well a more twisted one that is, that might have turned it into more of a surprise ending than a psycho thriller ending.

472459,A3KEH903M7EG2F,6305668353,Gordon Riley,"[8, 8]","I have always lived with the opinion that a good thriller movie should adhere to one of two set rules. Rule one: a plot that keeps you guessing to the very end with a multitute of plot twists, complimented with a climax  that leaves all previous perception to dust(Take Scream for example). Rule  two: a plot that is simple on the surface, yet has an ending that adds a  twist not previously noticed(Such as the Sixth Sense or Psycho). Perfect  Blue is an example of the first rule. The story surrounds a pop singer  (Mima Kirigoe) making a transition from music to acting in a commercialised  world. Along the way she suffers scrutiny for her choice of career from  fans, fear of being stalked, and dillusions of her actions and very  identity when things start to get violent.

Rather, this movie leaves me with a chilly reception.The hallucinations and memory losses experienced by Mima, the protaganist, are done to mask the ending and in doing so, several scenes are inexplicable and disjointed.  To that end, by the time the story culminates, it is anti-climatic and left me with a  big &quot;Huh??&quot;.  Whatever the director was trying to achieve with the viewer was totally lost on me.

There are just too many other great titles out there.  Try Cowboy Bebop for starters, or any of Miyazaki's work.Finally if you are seeking a psychological thriller, check out Psycho - its hokey by todays standards but at least you'll get a good laugh out of it.

The storyline is good and very modern by comparison which is a little shocking as most anime seem to deal with the fantastic, unusual, above normal etc. This is a very real story using a very real type of scenario as the plot for the young woman singer's move into film work. The only problem is that, it being a drama, it isn't one you are going to watch repeatedly, but it is a very good film. Much more real than most anime's that I've seen are, as this storyline seems straight out of many Hollywood actresses life experiences in trying to get ahead in the industry. She starts off singing, but the group isn't a hit until after she leaves, was it just timing? Lack of a hit song kills most such groups and those songs are rather disposable in the end anyway, but I did like the fact that she moved on and through inexperience and lack of knowledge or any easier way to 'get ahead', she did what so many do, paid the industry price, learned from those experiences and got her foot in the door and step through.

No wait, the strangest film I've ever seen.But the greatest part of this film is that I started watching it without knowing what it was about. I literally had no idea what was going on and that's the best way to watch the film for the first time. So, if you ever plan on getting your mind totally warped, read no further and rent (or download) the film. Otherwise, read on.This isn't your typical anime (as I've said before and I'll probably say quite a bit more). It starts out with a pop singer, Mimi, who is in a bubblegum pop band called ""Cham"". Don't ask me what it means, because I don't know ... nor is it important. Suffice it to say, that's the name.When the film starts off, Mimi is performing her last show with Cham. She's moving on to become an actress in this upcoming serial killer film. She's anxious about it, because she's gathered quite a fan base in her pop singing career (as short as it may have been - 1  years) and moving on to another can be suicide. Also the film involves some rather risky scenes for an ex-pop star, including a rape scene in a nightclub.But she forges ahead and does the scene, telling herself that this is just a hurdle she has to deal with in order to make it in the movie business.Meanwhile, various people involved with the movie are being killed ... stabbed to be exact.And this is where things get strange. If the following seems sporadic, then it's only because there's no other way to summarize the events.Mimi comes across a website called ""Mimi's Room"". It's a fan website with a diary section where apparently someone (or Mimi herself) is posting Mimi's every action and even some of her thoughts. She takes it as a joke at first, but of course eventually begins to think that someone is stalking her.Mimi meets this photographer on the street one day and he says she could be a model. They set a date and they meet at his studio ... him taking pictures, her modeling. He's renown for taking some risqu&eacute; photos and naturally the ones with Mimi get out of hand. Eventually, they become full-fledged nude photos. Later on she feels ashamed and this adds to her unhinging.Later on the photographer is found stabbed to death.Then the director of the movie opens one of Mimi's fan mail and an explosion sends him to the hospital.Mimi begins to hallucinate, seeing herself as what she once was - a pop star. She begins to have erratic daydreams, confusing fantasy with reality, blacking out ... until the end.I highly recommend it. While the animation isn't the greatest, it's not terribly bad. If you can make it past the first 10 minutes and the whole bubblegum pop show, you'll be in for quite a surprise, this film knows no boundaries.

472466,AKRRL7358VJIS,6305668353,"Ilker Yucel ""Kryptych""","[0, 1]","I do have to say that when I saw the name ""Katushiro Otomo"" somewhere in the credits, I was excited to see this movie. I love his work both in comics and animation (especially my favorite anime of all-time, the renowned ""Akira""). So when I borrowed a copy of this film from my best friend, I didn't know what to expect. Was I surprised. I have to say that never before have I seen an animated film that captures the reality of tormented human emotion better than this. ""Perfect Blue"" truly does count among one of the best films in the genre of psychological mysteries. There are those who will disagree with me, and that's fine since I can see the flaws in this film and why people would say it wasn't as good as I seem to be saying. It probably isn't, but I have high standards and tastes, and for them to be met is not easy (just ask my friends), so this movie is something to at least watch once if nothing else. Hitchcock would have been proud. There is a masterful handling of lead character Mima's breakdown, beginning from a simple voice in a reflection, to the paranoia that builds from the realization that somebody is following her. The immediate recognition of the stalker (who, I must admit, just HAD to look hideously deformed and given the most annoying voice...at least in the English dubbed version, which did an excellent job) was pretty welcome, and it gave the immediate impression that there was more than this one simple madman (who's name is even a bit hokey, but it still somehow works) behind it. There are also some elements to the story that were just brilliant. The constant back-and-forth reveries Mima had (waking up, and then waking up and supposed living the past few minutes over again...all in her mind...), coupled with the repetition of the line ""Excuse me...who are you?,"" was a stroke of genius. And the reflection in the mirror in the end chase scene, showing her stalker's blood-crazed vision in the reflection but showing her paranoid dual personality in realtime...that was just an eerie and very effective method to build up the confusion. Even the music was eerie, ranging from a simple one-note piano line to a harmony of swirling chorus vocals (not unlike Ligeti's ""Lux Aeterna"" used in ""2001: A Space Odyssey). On a technical level, the animation is very well done. The sets meticulously designed and the motion of the characters and their surroundings is very slick, almost to the point of realism. Flaws with this film? Well, there are a couple. One is the immediate impression that we are given to Mima's manager, Rumi. From the beginning, she is constantly pushing for Mima to keep singing instead of switch to acting. Such an obssession can lead the viewer to suspicion, which would eventually tend to manifest itself because let's face the fact that the viewer undoubtedly thinks more than the characters in the movie do. Another is that at one point, there is an indication that Mima herself might be her own stalker, and that her own demons are leading her to acts of murder. However, while the psychological effects on her are certainly cultivated, the overall possibility and suspicion that she is the killer is given little or no attention. It might have been considered cliche (and especially would not have been unexpected while watching the film), but there came a point where it just seemed necessary to at least explore the possibility. Yet, it seemed to die very quickly. Nevertheless, with flaws and all, this film is undoubtedly a triumph for animation around the world to grow beyond the confines of its drawn limitations and into a very serious genre. Alfred Hitchcock would be proud of this film I think, and the film never gets boring.

I went to see it in limited release and after seeing it i thought&quot; Whoa!&quot;. The plot concerns a young pop star named Mima who is leaving her singing trio named Cham to pursue acting. When she is given a role in a soap opera she is given a scene to do in it where she has to be violently raped (think Jodie Foster's rape in THE ACCUSED) and soon after she is being menaced by an obsessed fan who is infuriated by the way she is trashing her wholesome image. Soon after she starts to descend into a psychological state where she can't tell what is real or unreal and many of the people around her are violently murdered. Typically in an anime film the dubbing is poor but the dubbing here is great. The direction is very stylish and you really have to pay attention because the director really puts you into Mima's mind so that soon after you can't tell what is real or not. The animation is top notch and the suspense in this movie is constant and it keeps you on edge. This movie is not like an anime movie at all, you could easily mistake for a live action movie.

472468,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,6305668353,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[0, 0]","We all know what mangas are. A simple type of comic books dealing with the real world of today and its violence if not plain crime. Here this comic style is transferred to the big screen but it has kept its simple drawing and its modern and committed  subject-matter. A young female singer decides to become an actress. Some of her fans start chasing her to force her to come back to singing. This is the socially committed subject that turns the film into a thriller. But that is only half of the film. The second half is the schizophrenia someone has to live through when shifting from one profession to another and this is expressed by the editing to erase the boundary between what the real life and the stage-acting of the actress are. Her acting is blended into her real life that becomes a real nightmare. But I am surprised by the ending that decides to stop the suspense by going back to the plain ordinary everyday world. When the illusion disappears, the neurosis and the schizophrenia are dropped but also intensity and even life, because there is absolutely no life without the tension between reality and dream. But this cinematographic manga reveals that very Japanese style : very simple drawing and animation, very good and dynamic editing for a deeply social, cultural and psychological subject. There is no equivalent anywhere in the world, neither the super heros of American comic books, nor the Tintins and Asterixes of the European French-speaking ones.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, Universit?

As a Japanese pop idol attempting to shed her idol image to become an actress, the identity crisis which quickly envelopes her is also vividly felt by the spectator. Furthernore, the triple separation - between dream, Mima's first role in the television thriller &quot;Double Bind,&quot; and the real-world events of Mima's life surrounding her shift to an acting career - is so fuzzy that the spectator becomes just as confused as Mima, which is itself a superb and refreshing facet of the film.Those who do now know Japanese are are not habituated to watching films with subtitles should see the dubbed version first, as the necessity of literally &quot;reading&quot; a film would detract from the overall experience due to the spectator's wavering attention between the subtitles and the almost non-stop on-screen action. Perfect Blue is, in my opinion, a perfect film (except that the characters - all Japanese - appear to be &quot;white&quot;) - or as close to perfection as is possible in animation.However, MINORS SHOULD NOT SEE THIS FILM due to some highly adult scenes.

472472,AUS2EQT4NU3BF,6305668353,"Jonathon Turner ""Jon Turner""","[2, 2]","Japanese Anime is interesting in that while there are commercially driven movies and series made simply to sell toys and merchandise, amid the glut of such mainstream productions exist more daring, ambitious experiments which can nonetheless be considered great works of art.  Satoshi Kon's directorial debut, PERFECT BLUE, is one such Anime.  It is very rare to see an adult-driven, psychologically frightening suspense-drama that we would mostly get from directors such as Alfred Hitchcock, and the creator of THE SIXTH SENSE and SIGNS, but Satoshi Kon proves that, if given the proper treatment, animation can be used to not only entertain, but to strike emotional chords and leave a lasting impact on even the most jaded of viewers.First and foremost, PERFECT BLUE is ABSOLUTELY NOT FOR YOUNG CHILDREN.  This is an extremely dark and occasionally bloody thriller that will probably leave young viewers traumatized for weeks.  It's about a Japanese pop idol, Mima, who decides to abandon her longtime J-Pop status with her performing group, CHAM, and become an actress.  This doesn't sit well with her fans, particularly one deranged, creepy looking schmuck who stalks her from the shadows for a large marjority of the film.  Matters take a turn for the worse when Mima takes part in a sexually-charged psycho-thriller series (which requires our heroine to shoot a disturbing rape sequence).  A fan-made website details Mima's activities... even her most intimate ones!  (She even starts to get hate mail from her fans.)  Things get even more out of hand when her ""virtual identical twin"" (or something along those lines, who still wears the pop idol dress and has a deceivingly cheerful smile on her face) emerges from the website and taunts the young ex-pop idol about her ""tarnished reputation.""  In addition, her friends and associates become the targets of a mysterious imposter posing as Mima.If there's anything going against PERFECT BLUE, it may be the second half.  While the first half is carefully cultivated and plotted, the latter part of the film becomes a little difficult and confusing to follow, as director Kon switches between ""real-life"" events and ""dream-like"" events, leaving viewers struggling to figure out what's REALLY going on and what isn't.  Suffice to say, this isn't a film for everyone, but what ultimately makes PERFECT BLUE is how engrossed we are with the film, even when it starts to get more complicated (not in a mind-numbingly incoherent way like, say, NEON GENESIS EVANGELION), risque (in addition to the aforementioned rape scene--which, although obviously artificial, is quite disturbing to watch--we see shots of Mima posing nude for a perverted photographer as well as a classic scene involving Mima kneeling in her bathtub, clutching her knees, screaming her frustration over participating in such stuff), and violent (there are quite a bit of bloody scenes at points--not extraneously sickening like in NINJA SCROLL, WICKED CITY, or AKIRA, but shown for the horror that it is--including one person stabbed repeatedly to death in the eye, hands, back, etc., and occasional shots of brutally wounded suspects via letters containing bombs).  I normally cannot stomach these kind of films, but this one is an exception.  Primarily because Kon makes us FEEL Mima's plight and compels us to root for her in order to avoid being killed herself.  Of course, I WAS very puzzled at points in the film, but perhaps that is the point Kon is trying to make--some scenes give us the information we are asking for, but with others, we are simply required to interpret them ourselves.This certainly seems to be the case with the (absolutely unexpected) surprise ending.  I won't give it away, but it WILL take one a lot of viewings to truly comprehend the meaning of the last scene.MANGA ENTERTAINMENT has done a top-notch job with this title on DVD, presenting a solid visual transfer in addition to a well-adapted and adequately performed English track courtesy of the folks at AniMaze, inc.  In particular, Ruby Marlowe and Wendee Lee really stand out, and it's nice to have strong supplementary extras as well, the best of which are interviews from the voice cast and director Satoshi Kon himself.PERFECT BLUE is disturbing and violent, yes, but as an animated horror/thriller tale for grown-ups, its kinetic direction and dramatic staging is unparalleled.",4,"Scary, horrifying, & unsettling, but engrossing throughout.",1112140800,"03 30, 2005",2005,4393,"['Japanese', 'Anime', 'interesting', 'are', 'commercially', 'driven', 'movies', 'series', 'made', 'simply', 'sell', 'toys', 'merchandise', 'glut', 'such', 'mainstream', 'productions', 'exist', 'more', 'daring', 'ambitious', 'experiments', 'can', 'nonetheless', 'be', 'considered', 'great', 'works', 'art', 'Satoshi', 'Kon', 'directorial', 'debut', 'PERFECT', 'BLUE', 'one', 'such', 'Anime', 'very', 'rare', 'see', 'adult-driven', 'psychologically', 'frightening', 'suspense-drama', 'would', 'mostly', 'get', 'directors', 'such', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'creator', 'THE', 'SIXTH', 'SENSE', 'SIGNS', 'Satoshi', 'Kon', 'given', 'proper', 'treatment', 'animation', 'can', 'be', 'used', 'not', 'only', 'entertain', 'strike', 'emotional', 'chords', 'leave', 'lasting', 'impact', 'even', 'most', 'jaded', 'viewers.First', 'foremost', 'PERFECT', 'BLUE', 'ABSOLUTELY', 'NOT', 'FOR', 'YOUNG', 'CHILDREN', 'extremely', 'dark', 'occasionally', 'bloody', 'thriller', 'will', 'probably', 'leave', 'young', 'viewers', 'traumatized', 'weeks', 'Japanese', 'pop', 'idol', 'Mima', 'who', 'abandon', 'longtime', 'J-Pop', 'status', 'performing', 'group', 'CHAM', 'become', 'actress', ""n't"", 'sit', 'well', 'fans', 'particularly', 'one', 'deranged', 'creepy', 'looking', 'schmuck', 'who', 'shadows', 'large', 'marjority', 'film', 'Matters', 'take', 'turn', 'worse', 'when', 'Mima', 'part', 'sexually-charged', 'psycho-thriller', 'series', 'heroine', 'shoot', 'disturbing', 'rape', 'sequence', 'fan-made', 'website', 'details', 'Mima', 'activities', 'even', 'most', 'intimate', 'ones', 'even', 'get', 'hate', 'mail', 'fans', 'Things', 'get', 'even', 'more', 'hand', 'when', 'virtual', 'identical', 'twin', 'something', 'lines', 'who', 'still', 'pop', 'idol', 'dress', 'deceivingly', 'cheerful', 'smile', 'face', 'website', 'young', 'ex-pop', 'idol', 'tarnished', 'reputation', 'addition', 'friends', 'become', 'targets', 'mysterious', 'imposter', 'posing', 'Mima.If', 'anything', 'going', 'PERFECT', 'BLUE', 'may', 'be', 'second', 'half', 'first', 'half', 'carefully', 'cultivated', 'plotted', 'latter', 'part', 'film', 'little', 'difficult', 'confusing', 'follow', 'director', 'Kon', 'real-life', 'events', 'dream-like', 'events', 'leaving', 'viewers', 'struggling', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'REALLY', 'going', 'what', ""n't"", 'Suffice', 'say', ""n't"", 'film', 'everyone', 'what', 'ultimately', 'PERFECT', 'BLUE', 'how', 'engrossed', 'are', 'film', 'even', 'when', 'get', 'more', 'complicated', 'not', 'mind-numbingly', 'incoherent', 'way', 'say', 'NEON', 'GENESIS', 'EVANGELION', 'risque', 'addition', 'aforementioned', 'rape', 'scene', 'obviously', 'artificial', 'quite', 'disturbing', 'watch', 'see', 'shots', 'Mima', 'posing', 'nude', 'perverted', 'photographer', 'as', 'well', 'classic', 'scene', 'involving', 'Mima', 'kneeling', 'bathtub', 'clutching', 'knees', 'screaming', 'frustration', 'participating', 'such', 'stuff', 'violent', 'are', 'quite', 'bit', 'bloody', 'scenes', 'points', 'not', 'extraneously', 'sickening', 'NINJA', 'SCROLL', 'WICKED', 'CITY', 'AKIRA', 'shown', 'horror', 'including', 'one', 'person', 'stabbed', 'repeatedly', 'death', 'eye', 'hands', 'back', 'etc.', 'occasional', 'shots', 'brutally', 'wounded', 'suspects', 'letters', 'containing', 'bombs', 'normally', 'can', 'not', 'stomach', 'kind', 'films', 'one', 'exception', 'Primarily', 'Kon', 'FEEL', 'Mima', 'plight', 'compels', 'root', 'order', 'avoid', 'being', 'killed', 'course', 'WAS', 'very', 'puzzled', 'points', 'film', 'perhaps', 'point', 'Kon', 'trying', 'make', 'scenes', 'give', 'information', 'are', 'asking', 'others', 'are', 'simply', 'required', 'interpret', 'ourselves.This', 'certainly', 'be', 'case', 'absolutely', 'unexpected', 'surprise', 'ending', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'WILL', 'take', 'one', 'lot', 'viewings', 'truly', 'comprehend', 'meaning', 'last', 'scene.MANGA', 'ENTERTAINMENT', 'done', 'top-notch', 'job', 'title', 'DVD', 'presenting', 'solid', 'visual', 'transfer', 'addition', 'well-adapted', 'adequately', 'performed', 'English', 'track', 'courtesy', 'folks', 'AniMaze', 'inc', 'particular', 'Ruby', 'Marlowe', 'Wendee', 'Lee', 'really', 'stand', 'out', 'nice', 'have', 'strong', 'supplementary', 'extras', 'as', 'well', 'best', 'are', 'interviews', 'voice', 'cast', 'director', 'Satoshi', 'Kon', 'himself.PERFECT', 'BLUE', 'disturbing', 'violent', 'yes', 'animated', 'horror/thriller', 'tale', 'grown-ups', 'kinetic', 'direction', 'dramatic', 'staging', 'unparalleled']",Perfect Blue rated edition  VHS

That is what Perfect Blue is, an animated thriller in the Hitchcock-ian style.  Pop idol singer Mima Kirigoe decides to quit her career as a singer  and become a serious actress.  She has the talent to succede, but it  requires her to leave Cham, her singing group, as well as all her fans.  That proves dangerous, for one fan doesn't want her to go, and he will stop  at nothing to bring her back, even if it means he must kill to do it.  At  the same time, Mima is being haunted by a vision of herself as a pop idol,  and the apparition doesn't want to leave.  This film is very twisted.  It's  surreal to a point where trying to guess who the killer is becomes nearly  impossible.  The animation isn't excellent, but it is nice to look at  sometimes.  The music is not bad.  The real asset of the film is it's  story.  This is definately for adults.  The biggest flaw with the DVD is  that it promises you many features and only delivers on a few.  You have to  find ways to open other features (I had a hell of a time trying to find the  Manga 2000 trailer - which was a disapointment when I did finally open it.)

472474,A1QKCTSWTOOFRK,6305668353,Josh Leman,"[10, 11]","Perfect Blue is a strange and wonderful movie, and this DVD really does it  justice.  The menus are beautiful and fit the film perfectly, and the  extras are refreshingly good.  We actually get interviews with the three  main actors and actresses who contributed their talents to the (pretty  good) English dub; it's beautiful and kind of strange to hear them speak in  a normal conversational tone about the film and its meanings.  The  interviews with director Satoshi Kon and Japanese voice actress Junko Iwao  aren't as good, but at least they're there.  Everything else is good for an  anime DVD release, and the film... well, you have to see it and make up  your own mind.  A lot of people hate it and others (like me) think it's  great; everybody will agree, though, that it's confusing as hell at times  thanks to some crazy editing.  The movie tries to take us into the psyche  of a crazy person, and for this film that means not knowing what's real and  what isn't.

Is it too far?&quot;With Mariah, Lance, Britney and Mandy all doing their best to move from celebrated pop idols to the big screen, their real-life adventures will only add fuel to your imagination as you watch this marvelous anime feature. As the central character, Mima, stresses out over her &quot;adult&quot; decisions to become a serious star, her walls between dreams, reality and her career begin to break down.There's some stunning violence and generous helpings of female nudity involved, but neither seems out of place for the seriousness of this thriller. I cringed at the gore and I winced as this girl gave away her innocence. The finale had me on the edge of my seat. This story is just as thrilling and disturbing as &quot;Psycho,&quot; &quot;Seven&quot; or &quot;Fatal Attraction.&quot;The best part is, it has an ending. Quite unlike &quot;Akira&quot; (which is fantastic, but leaves you wondering what you just witnessed), or &quot;Ghost in the Shell&quot; (which is splendid, but the ending leaves one saying &quot;So then what happens?&quot;), or &quot;Princess Mononoke&quot; (which is beautiful, but the mythology is just too darn hard to relate to).... Thank goodness, for once, everything is explained and resolved with one series of climactic events.Someone said earlier on this forum that the animation wasn't &quot;real&quot; enough. Um, may I point out that this is hand drawn and wonderfully so. If the situations and acting and visuals here were so engrossing that the only thing holding that person to the 3-D flesh-n-blood world was the number of frames per second, then the animators surely have achieved their goal. If Disney is cooking up a piece of art like this somewhere, I welcome it, but I'm not about to hold my breath waiting for them to get past their kids-only entertainment factory.So, if we're fishing for criticisms, I'd have to say that it was only the murkiness of Mima's confused mind that frustrated me. Well, okay -- maybe it's fairly obvious early on that a couple of bodyguards will avoid the inevitable.

472478,A3D09XGX4FOLSB,6305668353,KinoChelovek,"[0, 0]","I need to begin my review by stating that I am not deeply into Anime features.  There are many I personally like, but, unlike myself, others are die-hard fans of this genre.That being said, I enjoyed ""Perfect Blue"" for its narrative.  I found a copy of the live action feature that was made a few years later (of which I have written an earlier review on Amazon) and thought that it was an interesting, but disjointed, film, mostly due to it being a difficult film to adapt from an animated feature.  I still maintain that is a flawed feature because live-action adaptations are usually problematic.However, I enjoyed this animated feature even more for revealing all of the problems the ""live action"" film has, which are usually due to the inability to realistically portray certain ""devices"" and narratives that can be portrayed in a animated format.To make the storyline short (if probably has been told in other reviews): Mima breaks from a musical trio, wanting to become a famous television/film star.  She has great doubts about the move.  In the meantime, she is introduced to a website that knows her every move and sees a strangely disfigured man who seems to follow her.  Her doubts, along with grisly murders and a ghostly doppelganger of herself, seems to follow and haunt her.  That is all I will give away.The late director, Satoshi Kon, is known for the really great animated feature ""Paprika.""  I didn't really mind this film, but hoped that it would be a bit more imaginative.  Maybe the fact that I had watched the live-action film may have given me a bias, I really wasn't ""wowed"" the same way I was with ""Paprika.""  I found the animation a bit rough at times, and nearly outdated at other times (not ALL the time).  The ""I don't know anything about the internet"" schtick was a bit much, but, hey, it was 1997 when the movie was made, right?  The murder story did not seem original at all.  I wasn't looking for ""Urosukodoji"" here, though.  The ""nudity"" stills are somewhat gratuitous.  Some of the supporting characters' animation looked overly cartoonish, harkening back to early anime.To be fair, there was quite a bit of originality, such as the animated portrayal of guilt in Mima.  Her meetings with her ghostly doppelganger are really nicely done, especially the chase through Tokyo.  I also like the inability for Mima to separate reality from fiction - a device not unlike that used in Aronofsky's movie ""The Black Swan.""  [NOTE: Aronofsky bought the rights for this story so he could use a scene in his ""Requiem for a Dream.""]I watched the movie with original Japanese language with English subtitles, not dubbed.  The voice talent was very good.4 of 5 Stars.  I wished for and wanted more, but was slightly let down.  As I have stated, I watched the live-action feature BEFORE watching this one, so I probably have negative biases towards this movie.",4,Interesting and Layered Anime Feature.,1358121600,"01 14, 2013",2013,2881,"['need', 'begin', 'review', 'stating', 'am', 'not', 'deeply', 'Anime', 'features', 'are', 'many', 'personally', 'others', 'are', 'die-hard', 'fans', 'genre.That', 'being', 'said', 'enjoyed', 'Perfect', 'Blue', 'narrative', 'found', 'copy', 'live', 'action', 'feature', 'was', 'made', 'few', 'years', 'later', 'have', 'written', 'earlier', 'review', 'Amazon', 'thought', 'was', 'interesting', 'disjointed', 'film', 'mostly', 'due', 'being', 'difficult', 'film', 'adapt', 'animated', 'feature', 'still', 'maintain', 'flawed', 'feature', 'live-action', 'adaptations', 'are', 'usually', 'problematic.However', 'enjoyed', 'animated', 'feature', 'even', 'more', 'revealing', 'problems', 'live', 'action', 'film', 'are', 'usually', 'due', 'inability', 'realistically', 'portray', 'certain', 'devices', 'can', 'be', 'portrayed', 'animated', 'format.To', 'make', 'storyline', 'short', 'probably', 'been', 'told', 'other', 'reviews', 'Mima', 'breaks', 'musical', 'trio', 'wanting', 'become', 'famous', 'television/film', 'star', 'great', 'doubts', 'move', 'meantime', 'introduced', 'website', 'move', 'strangely', 'disfigured', 'man', 'who', 'follow', 'doubts', 'grisly', 'murders', 'ghostly', 'doppelganger', 'herself', 'follow', 'haunt', 'will', 'give', 'away.The', 'late', 'director', 'Satoshi', 'Kon', 'known', 'really', 'great', 'animated', 'feature', 'Paprika', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'mind', 'film', 'hoped', 'would', 'be', 'bit', 'more', 'imaginative', 'Maybe', 'fact', 'had', 'watched', 'live-action', 'film', 'may', 'have', 'given', 'bias', 'really', 'was', ""n't"", 'wowed', 'same', 'way', 'was', 'Paprika', 'found', 'animation', 'bit', 'rough', 'times', 'nearly', 'outdated', 'other', 'times', 'not', 'time', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'anything', 'internet', 'schtick', 'was', 'bit', 'much', 'hey', 'was', '1997', 'when', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'right', 'murder', 'story', 'did', 'not', 'seem', 'original', 'was', ""n't"", 'looking', 'Urosukodoji', 'here', 'though', 'nudity', 'stills', 'are', 'somewhat', 'gratuitous', 'supporting', 'characters', 'animation', 'looked', 'overly', 'cartoonish', 'harkening', 'back', 'early', 'anime.To', 'be', 'fair', 'was', 'quite', 'bit', 'originality', 'such', 'animated', 'portrayal', 'guilt', 'Mima', 'meetings', 'ghostly', 'doppelganger', 'are', 'really', 'nicely', 'done', 'especially', 'chase', 'Tokyo', 'also', 'inability', 'Mima', 'separate', 'reality', 'fiction', 'device', 'not', 'used', 'Aronofsky', 'movie', 'Black', 'Swan', '[', 'NOTE', 'Aronofsky', 'bought', 'rights', 'story', 'could', 'use', 'scene', 'Requiem', 'Dream', ']', 'watched', 'movie', 'original', 'Japanese', 'language', 'English', 'subtitles', 'not', 'dubbed', 'voice', 'talent', 'was', 'very', 'good.4', '5', 'Stars', 'wished', 'wanted', 'more', 'was', 'slightly', 'let', 'down', 'have', 'stated', 'watched', 'live-action', 'feature', 'watching', 'one', 'probably', 'have', 'negative', 'biases', 'movie']",Perfect Blue rated edition  VHS

472480,A2NJO6YE954DBH,6305668353,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[12, 13]","For the first half of ""Perfect Blue"" I was wondering why this 1999 film, based on the novel by Yoshikazu Takeuchi, had to be an anime.  It seemed to me that director Satoshi Kon was simply trying to show that anything a ""real"" motion picture could do could be done by anime.  After all, ""Perfect Blue"" is devoid of mythical creatures or futuristic settings, so why bother to use animation to tell the story?  But by the end I was too caught up in trying to figure out what was really going on to matter, and when you are talking about a psychological thriller that it as much more important consideration than whether the film is photographed or drawn.  Even if the story is rather conventional by anime standards, Kon does take advantage of the medium to tell the story with artistic flair.The basic story of ""Perfect Blue"" is nothing new at its heart, but that is hardly a concern.  Mima Kirigoe (voiced in the Japanese language version by Junko Iwao and in English by Ruby Marlow) decides to give up being a plastic pop idol to be a serious actress on a television police drama about a serial killer (although the writer has no clue who the killer is at this point).  These major career change sets two things in motion for our heroine: First, she has to try to accept the new Mima, who has to endure a rape scene on the show and shooting a nude layout for publicity.  Second, she has a fan (Uchida in Japanese, but Mr. No-Mania in English) who does not like the radical change in the objective of his obsession.  The link between the two at first is ""Mima's Room,"" a website he has set that reveals far more about her than anyone should know.  But then they share something even more disturbing in common: Mima the pop idol starts ""visiting"" them both and while Mima is degraded by her past self for having sunk so low, her fan is being told the new Mima is a fake who needs to be removed from the picture.What happens then is a collapse of reality, both from the psychological perspective of Mima and the viewing perspective of the audience.  People who have harmed Mima in some way start showing up dead and the lines between reality and fantasy become totally obliterated.  The result is not only disorienting, but also totally compelling.  I have seen lots of films like this where I am supposed to put myself in the shoes of the main character as such reality and fantasy become indistinguishable, but few of them succeed as well as the last act of ""Perfect Blue.""  There is a point where Mima wonders if maybe she was hit by a truck she avoided at one point in the story because she can no longer remember the last moment in her life she knew to be real.  The paranoia of both Mima and the audience becomes complete.The animation is rather simplistic, but still provides the stylized realism of detailed drawings that makes anime visually compelling.  Kon takes advantage of the medium throughout the film in ways that would never have occurred to the director of a ""regular"" film.  There are also certain scenes, as when the stalker Mr. Me-Mania hears his beloved target Mima talk to him as she speaks from every picture of her he has plastered on his wall, that certainly work a lot better as animation.  The revelation of the truth during the climatic scene is actually done so subtly that I almost did not catch it.To return to my original question as to why ""Perfect Blue"" was made as an anime, I have to wonder if there is some sort of taboo regarding nudity in Japanese films.  I have no idea.  But I know that in the hands of a western director this story could have easily descended to the level of an exploitation film.  The end becomes something anticlimactic, but given the torturous web that was constructed I doubt any ending could be totally fulfilling.  Besides, there is something to be said for the ironic commentary of Mima's goodbye.The DVD includes a clip of the ""real"" CHAM trio recording their song in the studio and access to a faux Mima's Room web site.  There are also brief interview clips with some of the vocal talent on both sides of the ocean and a rather disappointing chat with director Kon, who seems unable to offer any insights into this production.  ""Perfect Blue"" is an ambitious anime that succeeds well enough in the second half to forgive any faults in the first.

472482,A1EEG7YJIYN60B,6305668353,Lesley Aeschliman,"[0, 0]","Perfect Blue is the first anime film directed by Satoshi Kon, and it's loosely based on a novel of the same name by Yoshikazu Takeuchi.  After I finished watching the film, I realized that Satoshi Kon had done a great job dropping quite a few subtle clues throughout the film before the truth is revealed at the end.  While Perfect Blue is a decent film, I'm not entirely sure I can recommend it whole-heartedly.  The film has some violent and bloody sections to it, and there's also nudity and the rape scene that Mima films for the series.  Even though there is no actual rating on the DVD release of Perfect Blue, I would only recommend it to anime viewers who are eighteen years of age and older.On this DVD release, you can see the film in English, in Japanese, or in Japanese with English subtitles.  On the main menu, the special features section is labeled as ""Mima's Room.""  When you click on the link, it takes you to a menu that is supposed to look like a computer screen showing the Mima's Room website.  Extras include footage of the Japanese singers singing a song in the studio, the English version of the same song over a still image of Mima, a slideshow of stills from the movie, trailers and other promotional things to promote items released by Manga Entertainment at the time this DVD was released, interviews with the English and Japanese voice actors and Satoshi Kon, and the DVD credits.This DVD also includes a DVD-ROM portion.  In this section there are wallpapers, QuickTime video clips from the movie and bonus materials, as well as a multimedia application that requires an old version of QuickTime in order to run.  However, if you do manage to get the application to run, half of the text is in Japanese.  Also, the video clips included in the DVD-ROM section have Japanese audio, but no subtitles.If you're a fan of Perfect Blue or of Satoshi Kon, it would be worth it to track down a copy of this DVD and add it to your anime collection.I wrote this review after watching a copy of this DVD that my husband and I purchased.",3,The first anime film directed by the late Satoshi Kon,1285632000,"09 28, 2010",2010,2055,"['Perfect', 'Blue', 'first', 'anime', 'film', 'directed', 'Satoshi', 'Kon', 'loosely', 'based', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'Yoshikazu', 'Takeuchi', 'finished', 'watching', 'film', 'realized', 'Satoshi', 'Kon', 'had', 'done', 'great', 'job', 'dropping', 'quite', 'few', 'subtle', 'clues', 'film', 'truth', 'revealed', 'end', 'Perfect', 'Blue', 'decent', 'film', ""'m"", 'not', 'entirely', 'sure', 'can', 'recommend', 'whole-heartedly', 'film', 'violent', 'bloody', 'sections', 'also', 'nudity', 'rape', 'scene', 'Mima', 'films', 'series', 'Even', 'actual', 'rating', 'DVD', 'release', 'Perfect', 'Blue', 'would', 'only', 'recommend', 'anime', 'viewers', 'who', 'are', 'eighteen', 'years', 'age', 'older.On', 'DVD', 'release', 'can', 'see', 'film', 'English', 'Japanese', 'Japanese', 'English', 'subtitles', 'main', 'menu', 'special', 'features', 'section', 'labeled', 'Mima', 'Room', 'When', 'click', 'link', 'menu', 'supposed', 'look', 'computer', 'screen', 'showing', 'Mima', 'Room', 'website', 'Extras', 'include', 'footage', 'Japanese', 'singers', 'singing', 'song', 'studio', 'English', 'version', 'same', 'song', 'still', 'image', 'Mima', 'slideshow', 'stills', 'movie', 'trailers', 'other', 'promotional', 'things', 'promote', 'items', 'released', 'Manga', 'Entertainment', 'time', 'DVD', 'was', 'released', 'interviews', 'English', 'Japanese', 'voice', 'actors', 'Satoshi', 'Kon', 'DVD', 'credits.This', 'DVD', 'also', 'DVD-ROM', 'portion', 'section', 'are', 'wallpapers', 'QuickTime', 'video', 'clips', 'movie', 'bonus', 'materials', 'as', 'well', 'multimedia', 'application', 'old', 'version', 'QuickTime', 'order', 'run', 'However', 'do', 'manage', 'get', 'application', 'run', 'half', 'text', 'Japanese', 'Also', 'video', 'clips', 'included', 'DVD-ROM', 'section', 'have', 'Japanese', 'audio', 'subtitles.If', ""'re"", 'fan', 'Perfect', 'Blue', 'Satoshi', 'Kon', 'would', 'be', 'worth', 'track', 'down', 'copy', 'DVD', 'add', 'anime', 'collection.I', 'wrote', 'review', 'watching', 'copy', 'DVD', 'husband', 'purchased']",Perfect Blue rated edition  VHS

I watched it, and ended up being creeped out for several hours, always glancing at myself in the mirror and expecting it to wink and hop away. Okay, maybe not that extreme, but it sounded good! @_oTo sum up the story, Mima is a young adult, barely on her own, who decides to leave her bubblegum-pop trio to become an actress, but soon finds it's harder than she ever could have thought. Beginning as a one-liner, she soon finds herself the main attraction of the show due to the perverted whims of the middle aged directors. After a series of humiliating things she's forced to do, her sanity slips and she spirals into self doubt and hallucinations. (I won't go any further because it'll ruin the story.)Cons: In the NR version, an extensive rape scene took a good 2 or 3 minutes, and it really didn't have that much meaning. Slightly hard to decipher storyline, but I don't necessarily think that is a bad thing. Lots of violence but it kind of works in, and maybe the tuned down version isn't so bloody. Ending wasn't too fantastic.Pros: Psychological thriller that's a lot of fun to watch; very scary. Beautiful animation. Fairly good voice acting. Fairly good dubbing. 100% unique storyline.

Written and paced more like a Hitchcock film than the typical action film, this is a story where the psychological aspects are as compelling as the sometimes-ferocious action.Mima Kirigoe is an idol singer, part of a moderately successful trio called Cham.  Since the career life of these singers is, at best, a matter of a few years, Mima has decided to leave Cham to try her hand at being an actress.  She lands a part in 'Double Bind,' a suspense thriller that will test her commitment in many ways, putting her in situations that some of her old fans find uncomfortable.  This explodes into her life in a big way when Mima finds an internet website that purports to be written by her.Whoever is writing the site knows too much about what Mima is going through, and she finds herself stalked by an unhappy fan that has developed a fixation on her.  Soon people are dying in gruesome circumstances, and Mima becomes more and more confused about whom she really is and what is real.  First time director Satoshi Kon is merciless, making sure that the viewer gets few clues about which reality is real and whether what one sees is in 'Double Bind,' 'Perfect Blue,' or in Mima's mind alone.This is really a remarkable piece of work.  Great care is put into artistic and musical values.  It has striking graphic qualities without the viewer ever getting the feeling that the images are overwhelming the story.  In addition, I particularly like the imaginative use of color.  Of course, the use of music is particularly important in a film about Japanese popular entertainment figures, and Kon makes sure that the film lives up to aural expectations.This is a rough, gripping film.  Violence, murder, and rape are depicted with the deliberate intention of making the watcher uncomfortable.  It skirts the edge of being offensive, and is sometimes classified as hentai - animated pornography.  It isn't by my standards, but 'Perfect Blue' is graphic enough to offend some people.

472489,A15TIGL6MKUWYU,6305668353,"Mark E. Summers ""Gamekrazy""","[0, 0]","A stylish, and sometimes fairly quirky movie, in which a pop idol turned actress loses herself as she takes on the role of the sister of a murdered model in a soap opera type story.  That, basically, without going too deep into this animated movie, is the main theme of this story.  The twists and turns the story takes from this basic plot makes for an engaging, thought provoking, and sometimes a scratch your head in thought movie.Mima Kirigoe is the pop idol turned actress whose role as the models younger sister, turns her world upside down, as her original one line role turns into something far more, threatening her life in the process.  After doing a rape scene in the tv series she's in, reality and fantasy begin interweaving themselves into her life until she can't tell the fantasy from the reality.  Subsequent events, such as posing nude for a famous photographer plummets her deeper into this fantasy world.As Mima slips more into the fantasy world, she begins to see herself as two people, the actress she is becoming, but also sees her former self, the pop idol, who taunts her, telling her she is the illusion.  The brutal murder of the writer of the tv show she is on, and the photographer who took the nude photos of her overlaps her paranoid delusions, blending through so that neither she, nor us as the audience, is quite sure what is really happening, and what she is imagining.To add to the confusion, a crazed fan who has hundreds of pictures of the pop idol Mima in his room, is constantly following her, and logging onto Mima's website, which is called Mima's room.  On this website is a personal diary of Mima, detailing the things she is doing and thinking, but Mima isn't the one who is writing it.  Confusing, isn't it?  Until nearly the end of the movie, it isn't any clearer to us, and the twists and turns are well executed, leaving you to believe one thing, and then showing you another.I won't give away the surprises of the film, but will say that the ending makes sense once you finally get to it.  I really only have one real complaint about the movie itself, and that's in it's psychology.  We are shown the progression of Mima's paranoia as events unfold, to where she can't separate reality from fantasy herself, but then, at the end, after the mystery is resolved, bam, she is just fine now.  I don't think that she would have really been able to recover so fast like that, not without some sort of psychiatric help.  It is true that some of what was happening was being caused, but there were also things going on inside her own mind, which she was creating, like the alternate images she would see of herself in the mirror.  These were a case of a real psychological delusion, not just a make believe reality.  That aside, I enjoyed this psychological thriller, and I think you will too.",4,"Not quite perfect, but nearly there",978825600,"01 7, 2001",2001,2835,"['stylish', 'sometimes', 'fairly', 'quirky', 'movie', 'pop', 'idol', 'turned', 'actress', 'loses', 'role', 'sister', 'murdered', 'model', 'soap', 'opera', 'type', 'story', 'basically', 'going', 'too', 'deep', 'animated', 'movie', 'main', 'theme', 'story', 'twists', 'story', 'basic', 'plot', 'engaging', 'thought', 'provoking', 'sometimes', 'scratch', 'head', 'thought', 'movie.Mima', 'Kirigoe', 'pop', 'idol', 'turned', 'actress', 'role', 'models', 'younger', 'sister', 'world', 'down', 'original', 'one', 'line', 'role', 'something', 'far', 'more', 'threatening', 'life', 'process', 'doing', 'rape', 'scene', 'tv', 'series', 'reality', 'fantasy', 'begin', 'interweaving', 'life', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'fantasy', 'reality', 'Subsequent', 'events', 'such', 'posing', 'nude', 'famous', 'photographer', 'deeper', 'fantasy', 'world.As', 'Mima', 'more', 'fantasy', 'world', 'see', 'two', 'people', 'actress', 'becoming', 'also', 'former', 'self', 'pop', 'idol', 'who', 'telling', 'illusion', 'brutal', 'murder', 'writer', 'tv', 'show', 'photographer', 'who', 'took', 'nude', 'photos', 'overlaps', 'paranoid', 'delusions', 'blending', 'so', 'audience', 'quite', 'sure', 'what', 'really', 'happening', 'what', 'imagining.To', 'add', 'confusion', 'crazed', 'fan', 'who', 'hundreds', 'pictures', 'pop', 'idol', 'Mima', 'room', 'constantly', 'following', 'logging', 'Mima', 'website', 'called', 'Mima', 'room', 'website', 'personal', 'diary', 'Mima', 'detailing', 'things', 'doing', 'thinking', 'Mima', ""n't"", 'one', 'who', 'writing', 'Confusing', ""n't"", 'nearly', 'end', 'movie', ""n't"", 'clearer', 'twists', 'turns', 'are', 'well', 'executed', 'leaving', 'believe', 'one', 'thing', 'then', 'showing', 'another.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'surprises', 'film', 'will', 'say', 'ending', 'sense', 'once', 'finally', 'get', 'really', 'only', 'have', 'one', 'real', 'complaint', 'movie', 'psychology', 'are', 'shown', 'progression', 'Mima', 'paranoia', 'events', 'unfold', 'where', 'ca', ""n't"", 'separate', 'reality', 'fantasy', 'then', 'end', 'mystery', 'resolved', 'bam', 'just', 'fine', 'now', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'would', 'have', 'really', 'been', 'able', 'recover', 'so', 'fast', 'not', 'sort', 'psychiatric', 'help', 'true', 'what', 'was', 'happening', 'was', 'being', 'caused', 'were', 'also', 'things', 'going', 'own', 'mind', 'was', 'creating', 'alternate', 'would', 'see', 'mirror', 'were', 'case', 'real', 'psychological', 'delusion', 'not', 'just', 'make', 'believe', 'reality', 'aside', 'enjoyed', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'think', 'will', 'too']",Perfect Blue rated edition  VHS

A soap opera role is offered, but Mima's character is less clean cut than desired. Regardless, she agrees to take the part and events take a turn for the worse. Soon, Mima's sense of reality begins to slip. She discovers her identical twin, a mirror image of herself that hasn't given up singing. Is it real, or part of her imagination? Before long, internet sites appear describing every intimate detail of Mima's life and a mysterious figure stalks her from the shadows. Her friends and associates are threatened, and killed, as Mima descends into a dangerous world of paranoid delusion. She fears for her life and must unravel fact from illusion in order to stay alive.This all makes for a surprisingly taut, suspenseful nailbiter that is gripping from start to finish. ""Perfect Blue"" is not the typical anime and that's what makes it so special. Ghosts, cyborgs, and mythical creatures are nowhere to be seen, instead, we are the players in a twisted psychological mind game. The last 30 minutes continually keep you guessing as the filmmakers keep bombarding us with brilliant twist after twist. You have to repeatedly question what is real and what it not, a difficult but enjoyable task that requires you to be on your toes to keep up. Great attention must be paid to detail because not everything makes sense at first sight, a perfect excuse for multiple viewings of this masterpiece. The theme music is quite eerie and totally appropriate for the tone of key scenes as Mima starts her downward spiral.

I have since bought countless DVD's with anime and this one still stands out as one of the best.CONTENT: The movie is really special. By that I mean: No 2 people will get quite the same experience out of watching it. It's unique for everyone. I remember going through several emotional stages as I was watching it. Through the first 30 mins. I was completely uninterested. A story about a pop idol? BOOORING. How long did they expect us to watch this? Then as things started to happen the next 30 mins. I was totally confused but now at least mildly interested. What the heck was going on? The last 20 mins. or so I was totally hooked. I didn't dare to blink fearing I might miss something important. How was this story ever going to end? Would it make sense? COULD it ever make sense?In the end it did, and upon rewatching it again and again I have found that not a single second of this film is a waste of time. It obviously doesn't have a huge budget, and it shows on the big screen, but the framing, coloring, lighting, camera movement, storyboarding, timing, animation and editing is absolutely perfect. They used what little they had avalable and made the best possible movie.And the english dub actually isn't half bad. Not the best but certainly not the worst. (A contender for worst possible dub ever has to be &quot;X the movie&quot;. Movie's fine but the dub - yeech!)DVD: Very cool extras. Interviews with director. Trailers and such. And brief thoughts from the english cast which by the way includes Ruby Marlowe as Mima. She also did the voice of LAIN. A performance that was truly one step beyond perfection.

However, this may mean compromising all she knows, and giving up what she loved.

472495,A2UQIIJ2CD8REE,6305668353,Monty Moonlight,"[1, 1]","Based on the novel by Yoshikazu Tekeuchi, ""Perfect Blue"" is the story of a beautiful rising pop starlet named Mima who decides to leave her singing trio under the urging of her agency to become an actress instead. It becomes an inner struggle for initially innocent Mima, who does not want to give up her singing career and is uncomfortable with the exploitive route she is being steered into of nude photo shoots and rape victim roles. Mima becomes psychologically unstable as she struggles to separate fantasy from reality, especially when she starts to receive visits from her own former, untainted pop-star self. Add to that a suspicious website, a horrifically ugly stalker, and a sudden string of murders focused on those who have tainted Mima's image, and it all becomes too much for the troubled beauty, but a final confrontation makes everything startlingly clear.Directed by Satoshi Kon, 1997's ""Perfect Blue"" has often been described and praised as a Hitchcockian achievement. How much of this praise stems from the amazement some may have of seeing such a story done in animation I really don't know. Still, it IS an excellent film. I won't deny that I correctly guessed the true antagonist of the story very early on, but enough red herrings are floating about to keep you unsure throughout the film anyway. Going along for the ride with Mima, the audience soon becomes as unsure as she is of what is real and what is not. The scenario is well thought out and disturbingly played out, and beautifully drawn. I was a bit worried at the opening, as the animation there was not much to be thrilled about (good drawings, but not much movement), but it quickly picked up and began to look more like other Anime films at least. In the big argument about Japanese animation vs. American animation, if their is one, it's in the story department and willingness to not limit the medium to children's fodder where the Japanese win out (though, don't get me wrong, I'll always be a Disney guy over anything else). ""Perfect Blue"" is a film strictly for adult viewers. There's violence, there's nudity,... think of it like any R-rated psychological thriller you might go to the movies to see here in the U.S., only this one happens to be animated. And, if you like that genre, ""Perfect Blue"" is as good as any live-action example.The DVD is widescreen and comes with Japanese and English dialogue, and subtitles too, of course. It's an unrated director's cut (the one I have is, anyway), and there is a neat menu of extras in the form of a mock webpage like the one in the film. It features interviews with the director and voice actors (unfortunately, we don't get to see the English dub ones, just hear them), a recording session for the pop-group in the film (Cham), a photogallery, audio track, theatrical trailer, and other Manga 2000 previews.",5,A Compelling Psychological Thriller: Animation for Grown-Ups Only,1250726400,"08 20, 2009",2009,2849,"['Based', 'novel', 'Yoshikazu', 'Tekeuchi', 'Perfect', 'Blue', 'story', 'beautiful', 'rising', 'pop', 'starlet', 'named', 'Mima', 'who', 'leave', 'singing', 'trio', 'urging', 'agency', 'become', 'actress', 'instead', 'inner', 'struggle', 'initially', 'innocent', 'Mima', 'who', 'not', 'want', 'give', 'up', 'singing', 'career', 'uncomfortable', 'exploitive', 'route', 'being', 'steered', 'nude', 'photo', 'shoots', 'rape', 'victim', 'roles', 'Mima', 'psychologically', 'unstable', 'separate', 'fantasy', 'reality', 'especially', 'when', 'receive', 'visits', 'own', 'former', 'untainted', 'pop-star', 'self', 'Add', 'suspicious', 'website', 'horrifically', 'ugly', 'stalker', 'sudden', 'string', 'murders', 'focused', 'who', 'have', 'tainted', 'Mima', 'image', 'too', 'much', 'troubled', 'beauty', 'final', 'confrontation', 'everything', 'startlingly', 'clear.Directed', 'Satoshi', 'Kon', '1997', 'Perfect', 'Blue', 'often', 'been', 'described', 'praised', 'Hitchcockian', 'achievement', 'How', 'much', 'praise', 'amazement', 'may', 'have', 'seeing', 'such', 'story', 'done', 'animation', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Still', 'excellent', 'film', 'wo', ""n't"", 'deny', 'correctly', 'guessed', 'true', 'antagonist', 'story', 'very', 'early', 'enough', 'red', 'herrings', 'are', 'floating', 'keep', 'unsure', 'film', 'anyway', 'Going', 'ride', 'Mima', 'audience', 'soon', 'as', 'unsure', 'what', 'real', 'what', 'not', 'scenario', 'well', 'thought', 'out', 'disturbingly', 'played', 'out', 'beautifully', 'drawn', 'was', 'bit', 'worried', 'opening', 'animation', 'there', 'was', 'not', 'much', 'be', 'thrilled', 'good', 'drawings', 'not', 'much', 'movement', 'quickly', 'picked', 'up', 'began', 'look', 'more', 'other', 'Anime', 'films', 'least', 'big', 'argument', 'Japanese', 'animation', 'vs.', 'American', 'animation', 'one', 'story', 'department', 'willingness', 'not', 'limit', 'medium', 'children', 'fodder', 'where', 'Japanese', 'win', 'out', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', ""'ll"", 'always', 'be', 'Disney', 'guy', 'anything', 'else', 'Perfect', 'Blue', 'film', 'strictly', 'adult', 'viewers', 'violence', 'nudity', 'think', 'R-rated', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'might', 'go', 'movies', 'see', 'here', 'U.S.', 'only', 'one', 'be', 'animated', 'like', 'genre', 'Perfect', 'Blue', 'as', 'good', 'live-action', 'example.The', 'DVD', 'widescreen', 'Japanese', 'English', 'dialogue', 'subtitles', 'too', 'course', 'unrated', 'director', 'cut', 'one', 'have', 'anyway', 'neat', 'menu', 'extras', 'form', 'mock', 'webpage', 'one', 'film', 'interviews', 'director', 'voice', 'actors', 'unfortunately', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'see', 'English', 'dub', 'ones', 'just', 'hear', 'recording', 'session', 'pop-group', 'film', 'Cham', 'photogallery', 'audio', 'track', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'other', 'Manga', '2000', 'previews']",Perfect Blue rated edition  VHS

I see it as a merger between Walt Disney and David Lynch, who did such odd films as ""Blue Velvet"" and ""Lost Highway."" Infact Perfect Blue looks exactly like an animated ""Mulholland Drive,"" which is Lynch's latest work. I won't give away any of the story, because everything in it is key. ""Perfect Blue"" steps away from the action scene which most Anime films focus on, and delivers a compelling, thrilling story that I have never encountered in animation before. The only reason I gave ""Perfect Blue"" 4.9 stars is because the ending song, which is the last audio impression you hear, it doesn't fit the film at all. The music during ""Perfect Blue"" is a chilling voice over music score. It fits the suspense of the film extremely well. But when the film ends, I felt like I had just watched an episode of ""Sailor Moon!"" One could argue the music fits because of a couple of reasons, all which I may agree on. But the suspense of the film was so great during it, I felt that they should have left you with a feeling of suspense.

It entertains well with a strange mix of brutal  violence and quiet reflection.

Go to the official dotcom website of the same name for information about the making of the film. The official site says that this was meant to be a live action film but production was interrupted by the Kobi earthquake and it was decided to change it to an anime. There is a mention of an earthquake in the background of a scene on a television set.I'm reviewing the version I saw, the Australian DVD release by Madman Entertainment as the licensee for Manga Entertainment. It is unusually Region Coded 1,2 and 4 (the zones of USA and Canada, Europe and Japan and South America as well). However, it is recorded in PAL format and except for Europe, these countries use NTSC, a different playback format. As a general point, make sure your DVD player has PAL playback before buying any PAL disc even if the disc is your region code or region zero (no region code) otherwise it won't play back properly or at all. There might also be differences between this disc and other region versions so check what extras you get.I don't like watching dubbed live action films but I'm perfectly happy with the English dubbed version on this disc which is well done. The Japanese language track with or without subtitles is also available. It's worth watching the watching the Japanese subtitled version. It gives a different feel to the movie. Some dialogue gets a different emphasis. It also shows up one error in the English dub at 1 hour 1 minute and 32 seconds. Mima should have said ""Rika Takakura"" not ""Mima Kirigoe"". This is confirmed by the Japanese language track and accompanying subtitles. This is important as it clears up some confusion that might be created in that scene as a result.Mima Kirigoe is a pop singer who is quitting her group ""Cham"" to take up acting. We quickly learn that longevity in the music business can be short in Japan. Starting at ground level in the acting business means she has no choice but to do scenes which are worlds apart from her wholesome pop image. Someone starts stalking her and sending threatening letters. One explodes injuring her manager. Even more disturbingly, she finds a website (called ""Mima's Room) that has details of her life that only she could know. Things get really scary when she starts using it herself to find out what she's been up to as her emotional state deteriorates.Murders of people involved with her acting career start happening. She might be being haunted and terrorised by her former pop persona that objects to the indecent things she has to act out. Mima may actually be hallucinating the threats and that she's being stalked. She may also be hallucinating the murders. She might actually be committing the murders. In fact, she might even be hallucinating her entire career but committing the murders - or not. Or she may be simply be going mad. Believe me when I say anything is possible in this film.The last 30 minutes continually keep you guessing as the filmmakers keep shifting the ground beneath the viewer's feet. You have to repeatedly question what is real and what it not, a difficult but enjoyable task and you have to especially be on your toes to keep up. What has been going on seems to be conclusively settled, if for no more reason that there is nothing following the end to contradict the final scene. The theme music is quite eerie and totally appropriate for the tone of key scenes in the film as Mima starts her spiral downwards. There is also a frenetic score that perfectly fits the intensity of the murders (or is it 'murders'?).This is an excellent film and a first class thriller. Within the first few minutes, I had even forgotten that I was watching an animated film. This film has a great twist ending, a killer final half hour and a streamlined plot in a compact running time. 3 things a recent and totally unrelated release ""Minority Report"" didn't have and needed desperately.The DVD extras are very good. A screen says you are being connecting you ""Mima's Room"" and uses a reverse of the pull away shot from Mima's apartment window in the film by zooming into her apartment, past Mima and then displaying a menu for the extras. Commentary from three of the main English voice actors is very informative and thought provoking about how they interpreted the film and decided to play their roles as a result. It is also interesting to compare Mima's English voice actor to her Japanese equivalent's take on the role. This is the director Satoshi Kon's first animated feature and he does a great job.There is a photo montage using frames from the film and text that details the key events of the film. Also, some studio footage of the Japanese voice actors singing a Cham song and the separate English equivalent (sound only) is an option. There is also some footage of the animators working on the film in the opening menu screen, it would have been nice if a small feature had been added showing the making of the film as well.Surprisingly (and fortunately) this film has not yet been optioned by Hollywood for a remake. This would not be a popular suggestion but IF amongst the current lot of Britney Spears, Mandy Moore et al, one of them did appear in a remake of this film and IF they stuck as closely as possible to this film and IF they did a good job, it would definitely add a dimension to their acting careers. There are obvious parallels as they also are all shifting their focus from their music to acting, which is the theme of this film, especially the downside of that transition and that of fame in general. However, that is a lot of 'if's and probably far too many to give great odds of success. All things considered it's probably good we have fortunately been spared the threat of a remake.A great movie and a great disc. Go see it, buy it if you can't rent it.",4,Perfect Blue is a near perfect DVD.,1025568000,"07 2, 2002",2002,5900,"['Do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'commentaries', 'other', 'extras', 'film', 'will', 'give',

I was excited after reading a few reviews saying how exciting and thrilling this movie was, and how the  ending was in the realm of Fight Club and Sixth Sense. The movie's pace was  pretty good, the characters were fine, but nothing special. I did get tense  a few times, and alot of scenes just confused me, but hey I didn't mind  cause thats the point of mysteries ya know? So I waited out the confusion  for a &quot;wam-bang than you mam&quot; surprise ending. It wasn't so much  as &quot;WOW&quot; or &quot;WHOA&quot; as much as it was &quot;What the  heck?&quot; I guess its the same reaction some had to the Ending of Scream  2 and 3 (not to me, I loved the endings) It does suffer a few moments that  aren't explained, like in Fight Club, but fight club was so awesome I could  forgive those moments so easily. Perfect Blue didn't make the wait  worthwhile, I did enjoy the way her life and the tv show seemed to  intertwine, heck I got so lost I didn't know if she was awake, asleep,  doing the show, or was it all real.

The story is about the main character what is attempting go from being a pop star to being a serious movie star. Now this may not sound like much of an interesting story however as any ne that has seen this directors other works like Paranoia Agent, Millennium  Actress and Tokyo Godfathers know better.Before I go on let me say DO NOT I repeat DO NOT watch this film when your tired, it is a mind trip. Also make sure not watch with kids around, suggest no one under eighteen. As there are scenes of nudity and a few of rape. Added the graphic murder scenes.Well as I said before the story is about a pop star that wants to become an actress. Her managers are split, one is a guy and is all for it. The other a female is completely against it. Well see manages to get a spot on a show called double blind, think law and order. Everything is going fine until people on the show start popping up dead. First the writer then the director and so on. The real story though is what's going on in the lead's mind. The real plot is the main character trying to figure out what is real and what isn't real. This is where the story really shines and makes it a classic. Why? Because the entire movie while the main character desperately trying to figure out if she's going crazy, all the while you're asking yourself are you going crazy. Yes this movie WILL make you question your own sanity. Hence why you should not watch this show when you're tired. Those of you who have watched his over works know what this director is capable of.The art work is admittingly dated not surprising considering the age of the work but still very good. The music I really can't remember enough to even rate. The voice acting is amazing some of the best I've found. The story is kinda slow but will keep your attention. Character designs though not really original are still as good as one can expect from a tow hour movie with such a heavy plot. All together if you like dark interesting movies by all means buy this one its worth it. If you want a light happy no thinking film skip this one.

It's not like anything I've seen before, and it's good in it's own right.  The animation is not the best I've seen, but  the story is interesting.  It's based on a pop star turned actress named  Mima.  She was a singer in a group called Cham that had fans, but was weak  in their popularity according to the music charts.  When she decided to be  an actress, this was established early in the movie, she begins seeing  images of herself as a pop star which in turn taunts her and in a way tries  to force her back into her singing career with Cham.  She wasn't put in  roles that makes her more established as being a serious actress, so she  decides, out of desperation, to be noticed, to have nude pictures taken of  her published in a porn magazine and before that, she agrees to do a scene  with her being raped in a strip club.  She is also stalked by a die hard  fanatic of her pop idol image who follows her around and writes about her  in his web site.

472526,A36D94ZAIRFAA1,6305668353,Trevor Wright,"[13, 15]","Perfect Blue, one those few animes that actually sound good in English or Japanese with English subtitles. Like it says on the cover of the box, if Alfred Hitchcock and Walt Disney made a movie together, this would be it.  Perfect Blue is amazing in the fact that it is one of those movies that you  think you know what is going on, but it has such a twist in the plot that  you don't.Plot: 4 1/2 stars. Though in the grand scheme of thriller  movies, it's not that new of plot it's still very deep and full of twists.  If you are a person who got lost of the plots of some movies like  &quot;Scream&quot;, &quot;The Matrix&quot;, or &quot;Fight Club&quot;,  stop! Press back on you're browser and do not buy this movie. This is a  movie you must pay attention to the plot or you will be lost. I was lost  when I first watched it half way through the movie, but I paid closer  attention and all questions were answered in the last 1/3 of the  movie.Animation: 3 stars. This is not robots ripping hearts out of  people, so the animation is average, but, on the other hand, it doesn't  need to be out of this world because the story doesn't need it.Music: 4  stars. Music usually fits the scenes. Sometimes it gets in the way of some  scenes, but not usually (That thought is really up to your  opinion).Voice Acting: 5 stars. As stated before, I run into very few  anime movies where the dialog sounds just as good in English as in  Japanese. With the American Dragonball Z out there and terrible voice  acting, I am very picky about getting my anime in original Japanese dialog,  but this movie pulls off both sides of the Pacific well.Bottom Line: You  loved the &quot;Scream&quot; or Alfred Hitchcock movies plus anime? You  will love this!",4,If they made a &quot;Scream&quot; movie into an anime...,962928000,"07 7, 2000",2000,1742,"['Perfect', 'Blue', 'one', 'few', 'animes', 'actually', 'sound', 'good', 'English', 'Japanese', 'English', 'subtitles', 'cover', 'box', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'made', 'movie', 'together', 'would', 'be', 'Perfect', 'Blue', 'amazing', 'fact', 'one', 'movies', 'think', 'know', 'what', 'going', 'twist', 'plot', ""don't.Plot"", '4', '1/2', 'stars', 'grand', 'scheme', 'thriller', 'movies', 'not', 'new', 'plot', 'still', 'very', 'deep', 'full', 'twists', 'are', 'person', 'who', 'got', 'lost', 'plots', 'movies', 'quot', 'Scream', 'quot', 'quot', 'Matrix', 'quot', 'quot', 'Fight', 'Club', 'quot', 'stop', 'Press', 'back', ""'re"", 'browser', 'do', 'not', 'buy', 'movie', 'movie', 'must', 'pay', 'attention', 'plot', 'will', 'be', 'lost', 'was', 'lost', 'when', 'first', 'watched', 'half', 'way', 'movie', 'paid', 'closer', 'attention', 'questions', 'were', 'answered', 'last', '1/3', 'movie.Animation', '3', 'stars', 'not', 'robots', 'ripping', 'hearts', 'people', 'animation', 'average', 'other', 'hand', ""n't"", 'need', 'be', 'out', 'world', 'story', ""n't"", 'need', 'it.Music', '4', 'stars', 'Music', 'usually', 'scenes', 'way', 'scenes', 'not', 'usually', 'thought', 'really', 'up', 'opinion', '.Voice', 'Acting', '5', 'stars', 'stated', 'run', 'very', 'few', 'anime', 'movies', 'where', 'dialog', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'English', 'Japanese', 'American', 'Dragonball', 'Z', 'there', 'terrible', 'voice', 'acting', 'am', 'very', 'picky', 'getting', 'anime', 'original', 'Japanese', 'dialog', 'movie', 'sides', 'Pacific', 'well.Bottom', 'Line', 'loved', 'quot', 'Scream', 'quot', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'movies', 'anime', 'will', 'love']",Perfect Blue rated edition  VHS

What I mean is that every time I asked someone about it, most of wom had heard but never seen, the imediate response was that it was loaded with nudity.  Not that it messes with the brain or that it is chilling, that it is loaded with nudity.  Well it does, in more areas of the female anatomy than most in anime.  But not to the full overblown extent that most take it to.  With that said here is the plot.Mia is a pop idol aka like Britney Spears or the Spice Girls.  She wants out of that field however to pursue a career in acting.  To shatter the Pop Idol look she plays a very adult role in a very adult TV soap.  Along the way she also poses in some very adult pictures for the fans, all in the attempt to shatter the Pop Idol stigma.  However a certain fan doesn't appreciate the new Mia.  He thinks the new Mia is a no longer the innocent little girl he fell in love with and is now a dirty tramp, and he is making her life hell.Overall this is a very impressive piece of work that will go into the catagory of the cult.  It is one of the best pieces of work I have seen and definetlty one of the top 10 psycho thrillers.  Just don't let the reputation behind it pull you in.
