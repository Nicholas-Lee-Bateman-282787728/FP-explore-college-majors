1507871,A2TXR85WQLE32N,B0060MYOH2,D. S. Thurlow,"[48, 50]","""Rizzoli & Isles"" returns for a third fun season on TNT in the summer of 2012, featuring the often hilariously mis-matched partnership of Angie Harmon as street-wise Boston cop Jane Rizzoli, with Sasha Alexander as the highly intelligent but socially clueless medical examiner Maura Isles.  Bruce McGill and Lee Thompson Young return as Vince Korsak and Barry Frost, Jane's partners on the homicide squad in the Boston Police Department.Season Three offers much emphasis on the complicated family lives of Jane and Maura.  In the very first episode, Jane and Maura must work through the issues created by Jane having shot Maura's gangster father at the end of Season Two.  Jane's own father, estranged from her mother Angela (a priceless Lorraine Bracco), returns to create hate and discontent by demanding an annulment and parading a much younger girlfriend, who will get involved with another cast member, to the consternation of Jane and Maura.  Maura, already hosting Jane's mother in her guest house, will have her own life complicated by the appearence of her long-lost biological mother and a sibling.Each week, the plot centers around one or more police investigations, the resolution of which will have the team racing the clock to solve the crime and save a victim before show's end.  Both Maura and Jane will be targeted by deadly opponents, creating a couple of especially suspenseful episodes.  In between the dramatics, there is much good-humored razzing among the cast members. The show thrives off the interaction of Jane and Maura, who endlessly bang heads at work and then giggle like two sisters afterwards.""Rizzoli & Isles"" is good summer television, and fun to watch.
