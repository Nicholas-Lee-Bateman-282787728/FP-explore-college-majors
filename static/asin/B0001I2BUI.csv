805957,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B0001I2BUI,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[12, 17]","Set in the 1980s, on the brink of this ""syndrome"", we follow the story of several people as they intertwine, interweave, and co-exist in a world frightened of the new millennium.  It explores the a series of themes like individuality, friendship, love, fear, death, life, evil, and most importantly heaven.  God has left us, abandoned us, as this film would say, as Republicans beat down the door in Washington and create rules set forth by old white men with a passion for reliving the past. The world, especially America, has become a very cold place.  As the millennium approaches, Prior Walton must choose whether he wants to become the next prophet for the angels.  He must decide, alone and scared, if he is ready for the challenges that await him.  He must choose for all of us.If you watch this film, no matter if you believe in what you see or agree, you will react.  That is the ultimate pleasure of this film.  It causes a reaction in its viewers.  Pulitzer Prize winning Tony Kushner develops this reaction thanks to an intelligent script and story about our world.  This was more than just a movie, it was more a cautionary tale of our lives.  It explores so many possibilities (all most too many to name) between religion, culture, race, economy, politics, and power.  An aspect of this film that pulled at my heart and mind were the words that came from our actors mouths.  This is not your normal grunt and sputter dialogue, this was imaginative, bold, and extremely provocative.This jumbled mess of a review is my simple attempt to trivialize this massive film.  Angels in America is one of those films that should be enjoyed with a glass of wine, open friends, and an open mind.  This film insights ideas and challenges thought.  That is why I loved the play so much, I have a passion for reading literature that breaks the cultural norm.  That shows us, the American public, what we are afraid to look at in that dark alleyway.  Angels in America, the play, did just that.  Thankfully, director Mike Nichols does not sway from that vision.  He beautifully gives us each detailed image as if it were the last.  Not only is the cinematography, should I say, exceptional (it is a very small word for the truth), he has quite possibly the best actors working for him.  Al Pacino, Meryl Streep, the AMAZING Jeffery Wright, the OSCAR WORTHY (if a film) Justin Kirk, and the powerful Emma Thompson, all giving more than 110% for this film.  It is films like this one is the reason why I love cinema.  When you have a film that goes beyond the mindset of the average American, you have already won the battle.  You film will stand out and speak to a new audience about the truths that surround our lives.In case you haven't noticed, I loved this movie.  Love is such a small word.  I adored this film.  This is one of those films that you will remember forever and want to watch again (all six hours of it) over and over.  The story is so tight that it pulls you in from the opening scene and doesn't sugar coat anything.  This is reality that just happens to be picked up by a camera.  This is a story about America, our America, and the relationships that surround us.  This film is like going into a history museum and seeing modern day images of our pilgrims.  Angels in America is the story of a new breed of settlers, crossing a new uncharted America, looking for a land that is not corrupt, evil, and sinister.  They are looking for their own utopia, much like our fathers before us.Groundbreaking.

Not only that, but the acting was absolutely wonderful, and the characters, flaws and all, came completely alive.Angels in America is modern magical realism; it has intensely serious moments and delightfully ridiculous moments as well. Though some of the situations fell a little flat and some of the dialogue got a little vague or wordy, this film makes up for its own flaws. I had to watch it twice to catch all of the cleverness.I loved Emma Thompson in all three of her roles, and Meryl Streep as well. I found Al Pacino a bit hammy but he usually is.

Standout performances also by lesser-known actors like Jeffrey Wright and Justin Kirk, among others, who appeared in the original stage production.Heavy going at times, but ultimately moving.Some viewers have left disparaging, even offensive reviews.  It makes me wonder why they selected this DVD at all, as the subject matter was quite clearly stated in the Amazon synopsis.  Why watch a story about gay people and AIDS if these are subjects with which you are clearly uncomfortable?  One person in particular, with nose obviously out of joint, asked, ""Who the hell do these people think they are?"" I wonder the same thing about him.

805961,A3LUZB2YONDGQC,B0001I2BUI,Arkaan Semere,"[41, 49]","I'm not joking.I'll be frank: I was hyped up for this film.  Even ignoring the incredible play that is actually life changing, it has a stellar cast and incredible behind the scenes crew.  I wanted it to be good; I needed it to be good.  To say that it superceded my expectations is an understatement.This play/movie challenges and provokes; entertains and amuses; floods you with grief and compassion.  Those final words (which I won't spoil if you haven't seen it) make my heart sing.  It features career defining work from Streep, Parker, Wilson and Pacino (Streep in particular is stellar in three different roles), and what had better be career exploding roles for Patrick Wilson, Justin Kirk, Ben Shenkman, and Jeffrey Wright.  These gentlemen are doing work that they'll have a hard time topping.  Wright manages to take Kushner's poetry and transform it into something Whitmanesque, Shakespearean in it's grandeur and heartbreaking imagery.  He does more with a glance than most actors can do with an entire script.  Patrick Wilson makes Joe's pain so real that it's heartwrenching for the audience.  When he utters ""I'm going to hell for doing this"", you can't help but cry out in sympathy.  Kirk is phenomenal as our leading character - he mixes pathos with deep (and broad) humour, and not only provides the biggest laughs (well, Wright too), but it's only because the comedy is rooted in pain.  Shenkman has the most difficult role - he's the author's stand in.  He's also kinda unsympathetic, and his hyperintelligence isn't portrayed as well as it should be (director/writer, not actor), but Shenkman manages to pull of these disparate pieces into a cohesive whole.I'm giving it five stars not because it's perfect (indeed, there are a few little flaws), but because anything this good doesn't need to be perfect.  Anything with this much stuff, in terms of ideas, drama, humour, depth and profundity is reall quite something.  The opening credits are gorgeous (seriously breathtaking.  That's how good this movie is).Watch it, treasure it, remember it, and whenever someone bashes Hollywood for producing crap, remind them that it can also produce beautiful things.

It's also six hours long, on two DVDs.It's full of stars: Al Pacino plays Roy Cohn, a Jewish lawyer and Washington insider who is ""evil incarnate,"" as one character puts it. Meryl Streep plays Hannah Pitt, mother of Joe Pitt (Patrick Wilson) and mother-in-law of Harper Pitt (Mary-Louise Parker), two very confused Mormons. Streep also has two other roles; look for her.In fact, quite a few people play more than one roll in this odd film. Emma Thompson is Nurse Emily, but also the guardian angel of America. She appears first in white, and later in dark blue with white. I think she also played a homeless person who told Hannah Pitt how to find her way to her son's apartment.My favorite character is Jeffrey Wright, a flaming queen who is Nurse Belize, and also a mystical travel agent, and I think also a rather phony leather queen in the park.Yes, it's that kind of movie.The basic story is that Prior Walter (Justin Kirk) lives with his lover, Louis Ironson (Ben Shenkman), but they break up when Prior is diagnosed with AIDS and Lou can't handle the whole thing. Meanwhile the evil Roy Cohn is trying to persuade the straight-laced (or is that laced up straight?) Joe Pitt to take a job with the Justice Department that he has arranged for him. Roy needs someone on the inside because he's about to be disbarred for borrowing a bunch of money from a client and ""neglecting"" to pay it back. Why Joe? Because Cohn is a closet queen who has lust in his heart for the handsome young Mormon.Unfortunately, Joe is tightly laced indeed. He and his wife are ""buddies,"" but their sex life is pretty awful for both of them. Also, she's a Valium addict and has hallucinations and weird episodes of a variety of types.It's hard to know when something is a dream, a hallucination, or a real part of the story. I finally decided it was easier to just treat them all as events to be evaluated later. That seems to have worked best.This is sort of a cross between ""Dogma"" and ""The Birdcage,"" although there is a lot of serious stuff, and a lot of sadness. There are also some superb laughs, as when the Angel has to ""revise the record"" because the Prophet to whom she appears, Prior Walter, is not behaving as predicted. But the sex scene between the Angel and Prior (whom, you will recall, is decidedly gay) is excellent, and reminds me of ""Angel Fire"" by Andrew Greeley.Just toss out all your assumptions and expectations, and enjoy the movie.

805964,A2ATWKOFJXRRR1,B0001I2BUI,"B. Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[14, 36]","(...)This is a controversial miniseries. As one reviewer pointed out, they had no idea what the film was about (only seeing the cover with an angelic figure on it). If you'd never heard of this film (for some reason) and only saw the cover of it at your local video store, the assumption may be that this is strictly a ""spiritual"" film about people and angels. Be warned, it isn't.So what is it about?That can be tough to put into one, short review but I'll give it a shot. So here goes.God is on a permanent hiatus/vacation and left the angels in charge of heaven. And they're not happy about it. They're working their...well...wings off trying to keep up with God's job (the scene toward the end of the film with angels at desks flowing back away from the camera is pretty impressive). Since God isn't around to answer human prayers, humanity must rely on each other ...with a little help from the angels. If there's any doubt that God is absent from both the angels' lives and ours, all you have to witness is the outbreak of AIDS/HIV, the silence of the Reagan Administration about it, and the horribly corrupt legal system that tries to be more letter correct than ethical.The story plays out against a triad of lives, basically. First you've got a young man who's in love with a Jew. They've been living together and must now face the worst of the worst: AIDS. Their acting is spot-on, comical at times, and very touching. Secondly you have an assistant district attorney (played EXCELLENTLY by Al Pacino) who's a scumbag with incredible clout (he can ring up the White House easily). But he's just been delivered a serious blow: he has AIDS, too. But he refuses to change his character. He's a yelling, screaming, evil, and twisted man who refuses to believe he's dying until the final moments. Thirdly, a newly married Mormon couple are encountering problems. The wife is having emotional and psychotic breaks, while her husband contemplates his own sexuality.Brought in amongst this group of people is an angel (played well by Emma Thompson ...who actually plays a triple role in the miniseries, being a nurse and homeless woman as well). One of the gay men begins to see her in visions when he's running fevers, or whenever he gets an erection (actually that's how he knows when she's close by). She tells him that he's The Prophet and that his life will have meaning. Her loving touch and frightful powers are an awesome spectacle on the screen.Played out against these characters (angelical and no) is the Reagan Administrations crushing absence of any mention of the AIDS epidemic. There are some great revelations that many of the characters bring across to the viewer during the series (mainly by Al Pacino as he lay dying in a hospital bed and gets visits from a rather famous person that he put on death row for being a communist during the McCarthy investigations).This series is excellently acted, perfectly filmed, and brings all the characters together toward the end. Toward the end ....And here's why only three stars were given by me. The end. The film makers did something unforgivable in my opinion. Instead of letting the viewer come away from the film with the understanding that AIDS is terrible and that God may not have all the answers for us (that we might have to turn to ourselves in times like these), the film makers set up a mini-talk documentary by the actors at the end of the movie, telling us about their political motivations and the HIV/AIDS problem; rather than having us come to those conclusions on our own based on the film's merits. WHY DID THEY DO THIS! I don't have the answer.I still recommend this miniseries. It's well acted and brings out an important message. It's just unfortunate that the makers of the film didn't trust us (the viewers) enough to think we'd ""get it"" and not mash our faces in the ""message"" at the end. If it weren't for that, this would've been a five star review.

805965,A26HD3S38PLD5A,B0001I2BUI,"BO BO BOB ""WESLEY""","[2, 4]","This was a great movie, only it seems to have been written as one long poem, of which I could not understand a word of what Emma Thompson's angelic character was saying--Gibberish, Gibberish, Goo, Gibberish. The acting was of the finest qualtity. Meryl Streep(Hannah Pitt & E. Rosenberg) is a constant. One would have better odds criticizing her performances that are not excellent. I don't know any Jews , but I have often heard of the stereotype about Jews and guilt. Ben Shenkman did the stereotype more than justice as the guilt ridden gay Jew, Louis, who leaves his  lover, Prior, when he finds out that he has A.I.D.S. His very anal over examining and judging everthing else, while well acted, was irritating. While not knowing which way to turn, he seemed to know what was at the end of every road. Al Pacino gave one of his best performances as Roy Cohn, the conservative, closeted gay king maker. Eyes never wondered while watching his performance. While many may have hated his character, none could hate his performance or fail to feel feel empathy at his suffering and death. Belize, the gay nurse was yet another gay angry at the world. He seemed to know everything about anything and was angry with what he knew. Jeffrey Wright(Belize) did well putting everyone in their place- guilting some, uplifting others, empathizing with more. His reluctant forgiveness of the just dead, Roy Cohn, and teaching Louis to forgive him was unexpected  and welcome , considering all of Belize's apparent pent up anger at his perception of a world hostile  and unaccepting of gays and all people who are different. Justin Kirk's Prior, played ever emotion to perfection.  One could not help but sympathize when he suffered and related to his frustration. Cheated out of life and refusing to accept death he took the viewers everywhere from angry with God and the angels, not willing to accept heaven to accepting of the struggle to live for life's sake, his performance was nothing short of deserving to be on the same stage with Pacino and Streep.One of my main problems was the writing, though great as a script idea, was too poetic. Everyone seemed to be teaching a class with one subject, from a a book of poetry written by one angry writer. This movie was good at portraying different views but, for the most part,  the views were different because the people were. One could feel that string of agreement running through the theme of the movie. We just had to wait to get there.  The big costar in the room was the antagonist of all things traditional, represented by the anger at patriotism, Ronald Reagan, tradition, Biblical morality, etc, etc. There was no positive view expressed for either. Patrick Wilson's character 's views represented the closest thing to ""the other side"". Now Streep's character was a good Mormon, but was educated to the error of her ways ,as portrayed in the film. She did not surrender her faith totally.Streep was excellent as Ethel Rosenberg and Joe Pitt's mother, Hannah. Her Hollywood nickname should be ""The Standard"". Pacino did not have to pretend to be excellent as Roy Cohn. Mary Louise Parker, who played  the pill-popping suffering, neglected, wife of Joe Pitt, did good as a spacy, wife, fed up with a husband at home with her, who did not want to be. Again, her lines , like most was total poetry. When not lashing her husband with  her tongue, she escaped her marriage , by escaping reality. The place she went to ,though, served no purpose at all for the movie. As angry as Belize was at America, Capitalism and moral non-relativism, , he was only rivaled by Louis' guilt and certain examining every aspect of life.  Louis(Shenkman)as a guilt ridden Jewish gay man , who new all except himself lit up the screen with his perfomance. Not knowing which way to turn after his crime against Prior, and by extension, everyone ill with A.I.D.S, he used nieve, freshly out of the closet, Joe, to asuage his guilt , until Joe falls in love with Louis and Ben discovers that Joe's paycheck is not signed by a member of the union.Great Movie. Too much poetry. Too one sided, as you know where the writers are going. No, and I do mean no, fair representation of opposing views. Not one full character represented the non-Hollywood, non liberal, non anti-Bibilcial view of homosexuality, suffering and compassion(except for Joe, but he was confused and bewildered throughout much of the movie). Anger was everone's motive. The portrayal of suffering from A.I.D.S emotionally and physically was revealing and educational. The goal of teaching those of us not touched by this disease-met. The goal of a great movie sometimes,  is to take us where we don't want to go. This should include the screenwriters.PS. I absolutely loved the gospel song sang in the church, at the funeral,  by the transvestite. If anyone knows, please leave a comment and let me know it that song is on the soundtrack before I purchase it.",4,Extended Great Partisan Poem,1305504000,"05 16, 2011",2011,4950,"['was', 'great',

805966,A2MSOMM8D4XHDL,B0001I2BUI,Brandon T.,"[8, 18]","Angels in America was a big undertaking for HBO. They took the wonderful play by Tony Kushner and got a great cast and director. Among the cast is Meryl Streep as a rabbi/Ethel Rosenburg and numerous characters. She, Al Pacino, James Cromwell, and Sir Michael Gambon add to the wonderful cast. Cast aside, this film is funny and thought-provoking. Let's face it, today that's a rarity.Like any work, it has its highs and lows. Among the highs are wonderful acting jobs, biting humor, and a good take on the controversial AIDS crisis. The series goes much deeper to cover the 1980s way of life and many other issues. For that, it deserves praise. The lows include excessive language, some outlandish situations, and too much dialogue in some spots. But overall, this is a work that needs watching.In conclusion, if you want to see a work that is fresh and thoughtful buy this DVD.

805968,A3VIOCJZ22JZXT,B0001I2BUI,C. B Collins Jr.,"[22, 29]","This film version of Angels in America is an exceptional accomplishment. The production and acting were superb, possibly some of the best caught on film. Al Pacino does a wonderful job of playing the dying Roy Cohn. Meryl Streep is magnificent playing both the ghost of Ethel Rosenberg and the Mormon matron, Hannah Pitt. Mary Louise Parker plays the Mormon housewife struggling with a gay husband while also struggling with her sanity. Justin Kirk is superb as Prior, a gay man dying of AIDS while also dealing with the abandonment by his partner, Lewis.Patrick Wilson suffers through the guilt of leaving his wife, telling his mother about his sexual orientation, while being propelled into the energy of his new gay identity.  All the other actors were superb but Streep and Pacino were extremely powerful and moving.The script is poetic, much like Shakespeare in beauty, fluidity, and emotional penetration. Therefore the viewer should not expect realistic naturalistic dialogue. The stage is often more suited for the poetic than is the screen, but Mike Nichols stayed true to the message and kept the beautiful dialogue as originally written. The language is so stimulating that I suggest the viewer have a copy of screenplay nearby so they can re-experience the lines.What is this play about? It is about AIDS, conservative politics, history, relationships, self awareness, religion, theology, love, forgiveness, survival and transcendence.What are the angels? They are the ever expanding idea of freedom. Only a genius of Kushner's standing could equate the movement of the Mormon's to Utah to gain religious freedom, with the modern gay civil rights movement, with the rise of Gorbachev and the fall of the Soviet Union.What is the central theme? The tension between our duty and responsibilities to others and the duty and responsibility to be true to ourself. Joe and Lewis both struggle with this dilemna which is the central armature of the play. However upon that armature hangs far more pain and history that almost any other theatrical production.I strongly recommend this production and wish I could give it more than 5 stars.More life.

805977,A3CN9CCJUNIPKT,B0001I2BUI,DJ Joe Sixpack,"[301, 343]","A jaw-dropping film adaptation of Tony Kushner's epic, 5-hour play, which was a defining artistic statement documenting the political and social upheaval that AIDS-HIV disease brought to America's gay community and to the wider America around it.  Mixing agitprop and camp with magical realism and utter, heart-rending, pathos, Kushner and director Mike Nichols bring the story to the screen in a big, big way, with all-around amazing performances by a perfectly cast ensemble.  Al Pacino gets to chew up yards of scenery in his portrayal of the sleazy, venal, far-rightwing attorney Roy Cohn (who acted as Joe McCarthy's point man in the infamous 1950s prosecution of ""atom spies"" Julius and Ethel Rosenberg) and for once, all of Pacino's high-decibel yelling pays off with some real dramatic ooompf.There are a lot of things that you could comment on in this play -- the exploration of Jewish-American assimilation, the powerful reaffirmation of a supposedly marginalized leftist perspective, etc. -- but the most profound insight Kushner has to offer is about who the real redeeming angels will have to be in our nation's coming cultural reconciliation.  The humanity that he is able to impart into the character of the middle-American Mormon, Mother Pitt (played faultlessly by Meryl Streep), is a marvel of modern political drama: and it rings undeniably true.  Pushing past our narrowly defined social and political ""roles,"" and into our shared humanity, is the only road open to folks who want to see America's moral and ethical core liberated from the ideological intrusions of the religious far-right, and the resulting frustrated anger of the disenfranchised middle-liberal-left.  In a strictly us-vs-them world view, Mother Pitt would be derided by those on the we're-here-we're-queer Left... but as many people have learned, particularly amid the devastating upheavals of the HIV crisis, our real emotional lives are (ideally) not ruled by dogma.  Mother Pitt isn't just a caring parent, she's also a kind, pragmatic person, and for her, the most pragmatic choice when confronted with an epidemic, is to simply offer sympathy and solace.  What could be more natural?  Let's hope her example prevails.",5,A profound human dimension amid the politics and pain,1080950400,"04 3, 2004",2004,2212,"['jaw-dropping', 'film', 'adaptation', 'Tony', 'Kushner', 'epic', '5-hour', 'play', 'was', 'defining', 'artistic', 'statement', 'documenting', 'political', 'social', 'upheaval', 'AIDS-HIV', 'disease', 'brought', 'America', 'gay', 'community', 'wider', 'America', 'Mixing', 'agitprop', 'camp', 'magical', 'realism', 'utter', 'heart-rending', 'pathos', 'Kushner', 'director', 'Mike', 'Nichols', 'bring', 'story', 'screen', 'big', 'big', 'way', 'all-around', 'amazing', 'performances', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'ensemble', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'chew', 'up', 'yards', 'scenery', 'portrayal', 'sleazy', 'venal', 'far-rightwing', 'attorney', 'Roy', 'Cohn', 'who', 'acted', 'Joe', 'McCarthy', 'point', 'man', 'infamous', '1950s', 'prosecution', 'atom', 'spies', 'Julius', 'Ethel', 'Rosenberg', 'once', 'Pacino', 'high-decibel', 'yelling', 'pays', 'off', 'real', 'dramatic', 'are', 'lot', 'things', 'could', 'comment', 'play', 'exploration', 'Jewish-American', 'assimilation', 'powerful', 'reaffirmation', 'supposedly', 'marginalized', 'leftist', 'perspective', 'etc', 'most', 'profound', 'insight', 'Kushner', 'offer', 'who', 'real', 'redeeming', 'angels', 'will', 'have', 'be', 'nation', 'coming', 'cultural', 'reconciliation', 'humanity', 'able', 'impart', 'character', 'middle-American', 'Mormon', 'Mother', 'Pitt', 'played', 'faultlessly', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'marvel', 'modern', 'political', 'drama', 'undeniably', 'true', 'Pushing', 'narrowly', 'defined', 'social', 'political', 'roles', 'shared', 'humanity', 'only', 'road', 'open', 'folks', 'who', 'want', 'see', 'America', 'moral', 'ethical', 'core', 'liberated', 'ideological', 'intrusions', 'religious', 'far-right', 'resulting', 'frustrated', 'anger', 'disenfranchised', 'middle-liberal-left', 'strictly', 'us-vs-them', 'world', 'view', 'Mother', 'Pitt', 'would', 'be', 'derided', ""we're-here-we're-queer"", 'Left', 'many', 'people', 'have', 'learned', 'particularly', 'devastating', 'upheavals', 'HIV', 'crisis', 'real', 'emotional', 'lives', 'are', 'ideally', 'not', 'ruled', 'dogma', 'Mother', 'Pitt', ""n't"", 'just', 'caring', 'parent', 'also', 'kind', 'pragmatic', 'person', 'most', 'pragmatic', 'choice', 'when', 'confronted', 'epidemic', 'simply', 'offer', 'sympathy', 'solace', 'What', 'could', 'be', 'more', 'natural', 'Let', 'hope', 'example']",Angels in America
805978,AVCRD98TH48RN,B0001I2BUI,D. Knouse,"[7, 22]","The cast is truly phenomenal led by veteran living legends Meryl Streep, Emma Thompson, and a scene-stealing Al Pacino.  The rest of the cast is solid with particularly memorable performances from Mary Louise Parker and Jeffrey Wright.  The direction is inspired, to say the least, with superb set designs and some fantastic coaxing with the actors to bring out some genuine performances.  And the script is based on a Pulitzer Prize winning play.  The writing is, in itself, remarkable...and incredibly depressing.  The story takes place in the mid-80s with the emergence of the AIDS epidemic which is often referred to as another Black Death brought upon humanity.  There are characters who struggle with the disease, others who struggle with their faith in religion and politics...and each other.  The overall effect of this 6-part series is not uplifting ever, with all the characters being very human but sometimes coming across a little too sanctimonious and/or emotional.  By the time part 4 ended I really didn't care about any of the plot resolutions to come, nor about any of the characters involved.  Part 5 and 6 seemed interminable by comparison to the first 4 parts.  There is also a lot of homosexuality in the story, some of which is very explicit, which does lend a strange kind of taboo freshness to the plotting, but by the end of the show I was shrugging my shoulders in confusion.  There are no revelations...only great suffering sparked by the occasional glimmer of hope that is soon snuffed out by a high minded gust of wind.  The last scene of the series is a soliloquy for Mary Louise Parker's character which suggests while we need hope it probably isn't very likely we will find it any time soon.  I cannot recommend this series for the simple fact that I don't want to relive another 6 hours of creative depression, regardless of how well made or how well acted the show is.  Final note: there are no special features on either disc, which is surprising given the amount of talent and effort went into making this series.",3,"Fantastc cast, inspired direction, great words...depressing.",1097712000,"10 14, 2004",2004,2049,"['cast', 'truly', 'phenomenal', 'led', 'veteran', 'living', 'legends', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'scene-stealing', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'rest', 'cast', 'solid', 'particularly', 'memorable', 'performances', 'Mary', 'Louise', 'Parker', 'Jeffrey', 'Wright', 'direction', 'inspired', 'say', 'least', 'superb', 'set', 'designs', 'fantastic', 'coaxing', 'actors', 'bring', 'out', 'genuine', 'performances', 'script', 'based', 'Pulitzer', 'Prize', 'winning', 'play', 'writing', 'remarkable', 'incredibly', 'depressing', 'story', 'place', 'mid-80s', 'emergence', 'AIDS', 'epidemic', 'often', 'referred', 'Black', 'Death', 'brought', 'upon', 'humanity', 'are', 'characters', 'who', 'struggle', 'disease', 'others', 'who', 'struggle', 'faith', 'religion', 'politics', 'other', 'overall', 'effect', '6-part', 'series', 'not', 'uplifting', 'ever', 'characters', 'being', 'very', 'human', 'sometimes', 'coming', 'little', 'too', 'sanctimonious', 'and/or', 'emotional', 'time', 'part', '4', 'ended', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'plot', 'resolutions', 'come', 'characters', 'involved', 'Part', '5', '6', 'seemed', 'interminable', 'comparison', 'first', '4', 'parts', 'also', 'lot', 'homosexuality', 'story', 'very', 'explicit', 'lend', 'strange', 'kind', 'taboo', 'freshness', 'plotting', 'end', 'show', 'was', 'shrugging', 'shoulders', 'confusion', 'are', 'revelations', 'only', 'great', 'suffering', 'sparked', 'occasional', 'glimmer', 'hope', 'soon', 'snuffed', 'out', 'high', 'minded', 'gust', 'wind', 'last', 'scene', 'series', 'soliloquy', 'Mary', 'Louise', 'Parker', 'character', 'need', 'hope', 'probably', ""n't"", 'very', 'likely', 'will', 'find', 'time', 'soon', 'can', 'not', 'recommend', 'series', 'simple', 'fact', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'relive', '6', 'hours', 'creative', 'depression', 'regardless', 'how', 'well', 'made', 'how', 'well', 'acted', 'show', 'Final', 'note', 'are', 'special', 'features', 'disc', 'surprising', 'given', 'amount', 'talent', 'effort', 'went', 'making', 'series']",Angels in America
805979,A1VV7MD14UNIAK,B0001I2BUI,"Doggy Bird ""doggybird""","[23, 30]","I am writing this after having watched 'Angels in America' on HBO for perhaps the tenth or twelfth time since it was first aired earlier this year.  Every time I watch it I see something new or understand a different aspect of the film than I did the last time.  It is so rich with humor, pathos, deep thought, questioning, rage, understanding and generosity of spirit that it never ceases to take my breath away.  I imagine I will still be watching it--frequently--years from now as a result of having the DVDs available to own.  I would have bought them at any price, but to have them priced SO CHEAPLY by Amazon makes it impossible for me to imagine not owning them.  I have been waiting since I first saw the film on HBO for the DVDs to be released.I have always been a fan of Al Pacino and of Meryl Streep, but I don't think it's an exageration to say that nothing Pacino has ever done before prepares you for the intensity of his performance as Roy Cohn.  It is beyond superb.  I have to believe that every actor hopes to reach this level of performance one time in their lives, but very few are ever able to do so.  I think it defines acting, as I have never been so moved by an evil character in my life.  As for Meryl Streep, well, I have seen her in other roles which moved me profoundly, and I am never surprised that she astounds us with almost every performance.  But her performances in this film are earth-shattering.  Almost every actor in this film is astonishing.  James Wright is so remarkable I cannot believe he is not better known outside the New York theater.There is so much compassion in this film.  Compassion for each and every one of the characters as well as for humanity in general, which means of course that Tony Kushner is not only a genius--but the heart and conscience of a generation.  I am so impressed by this man's mind, his heart and his great loving soul that thinking about what kind of person he must be brings tears to my eyes.The direction of this film gives me a level of respect for Mike Nichols that I never suspected.  I have always enjoyed and admired his films, but this is so far beyond what I expect from him, that I want to go back and see all his other films again to know if I have been missing something, or if he has just surged with age to a place way beyond where he seemed to be.There are problems both with the play and the production, as others have mentioned.  These include places where things don't 'work' or just seem weaker than other parts.  In a way they are more obvious because of the strength of the rest of the film.  However, it seems worse than petty to dwell on these minor points or moments in a film of such quality.  It's like dwelling on a mosquito bite on the body of a Goddess.Which brings me to perhaps the most important aspect of this film.  This country is so divided and hostile today that I find a work of art like 'Angels in America' has even more relevance than it did when it was written.  It is exactly Kushner's compassionate view of both the worst of humanity and the best of humanity that distinguishes this work, along with his honest portrayal of flaws in the thinking and the behavior of both sides of the 'Great Divide'.  [Being less compassionate than Kushner, only my most generous heart--and not any part of my mind--manages to include Roy Cohn in the 'human' category--and even then only because of Kushner's portrayal of him--before seeing this film I could think of Roy Cohn only as the devil himself].  This is not to misinterpret his politics and sympathies which are clearly liberal...but he chooses to humanize rather than demonize those with opposing views.  And he has very sympathetic characters point out the flaws in the liberal 'mythology'.  The piece has liberal politics but it is not a liberal tract by any means.Kushner examines the aspects of his characters and of Americans in general, that unite them in their humanity.  He also illustrates those aspects which demean and divide them--greed, fear, vindictiveness, hypocrisy, arrogance and self-absorption all make their appearance.  Yet rather than demonize the characters, these weaknesses serve to show their shared complexity, their shared humanity.  In his compassion, Kushner forgives even his most evil characters, and is hopeful even in despair.  He portrays the complexity of human nature rather than playing to win his arguments by appealing to ignorance through simplifying the issues in question.For those reviewers who say they did not understand this film, I find it hard to believe they really watched it.  My husband's favorite movie is ""Dumb and Dumber"" and he watches inane reruns of situation comedies that were moronic the first time around.  Yet he was the one who saw 'Angels in America' first and taped it for me and insisted nightly when I returned from a business trip that I stay up and watch this movie instead of doing what I would normally do on a 'work night' [which is NOT watch TV].  He then recommended it to all of our neighbors and friends and loaned his precious video to people who didn't have HBO.  Usually VERY quiet, I saw him ask each person who returned the film what they thought about it.  Since he is a deeply SECULAR man, I've never seen him proselytize for a movie before.People say this is a film about AIDs and about homosexuality, and on some level it is that.  But much more it is about love, compassion, tolerance and AMERICA.  It is so much about the miracle of AMERICA in its theory, its myths, and its beautiful and awful reality.  It is also a love song to New York, (a description usually used to refer to Woody Allen movies) but to the spiritual rather than the physical New York.Lastly, 'Angels in America' is about faith and religion, and how one's faith and/or religious beliefs can enoble or limit the scope of one's life.  It is about the spiritual vs. the religious and the places where these worlds come together, and how they also exist apart.  It is a truly great film.",5,"MOST SURPRISING, PROFOUND & MOVING WORK OF ART EVER ON TV",1094860800,"09 11, 2004",2004,6008,"['am', 'writing', 'having', 'watched', ""'Angels"", 'America', 'HBO',

A winner of 5 Golden Globes and several Emmys, the play (and movie) deal with the early discovery of AIDS and its affect (or lack thereof) on the Reagan administration.The major characters are Joe Pitt (played by Patrick Wilson); Roy Cohn (played by Al Pacino); Ethel Rosenberg, et al. (played by Meryl Streep); The Angel, et al. (played by Emma thompson); Prior Walter (played by Justin Kirk); Belize (played by Jeffrey Wright); Harper Pitt (played by Mary-Louise Parker), and Ben Shenkman (played by Louis Ironson).  Meryl Streep is absolutely unbelievable in ANY role she plays here (as always).  Al Pacino is just as fantastic as Roy Cohn.  You just want to kill him, but (as the saying goes) he eventually gets what's coming to him.Mary-Louise Parker defies description in her performance of the eternally depressed, pill-popping, wife-of-convenience, Harper Pitt.  Patrick Wilson plays her husband of convenience who is so brainwashed by regligion, he sets himself on a path where neither he nor anyone who comes to associate him will ever be happy--although he so desparately wants to be.  Justin Kirk plays the AIDS-ridden ""prophet,"" that the angels have decided to contact.  Too bad his agents or whomever it was involved with the movie thought only to nominate him as a supporting actor, when he is the main character in the play and movie.  When they tried to right their wrong, the votes were in and he wound up being nominated for nothing!  Jeffrey Wright reprised his role of Belize.Although never preachy, this movie does deliver a very serious message:  that gay people have (and want) just as much rights to live as others.  Reagan had a great ability of burying his head in the sand on matters regarding AIDS, and it cost countless lives--both gay and straight.This movie is divided into 6 parts, with a total running time of 352 minutes.  I could have watched double that time.  I loved it all.  I did think when Prior made it to heaven, there should have been more to it than it showed, but it's the ending that I will NEVER forget.  And I'm betting, neither will you.

805984,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B0001I2BUI,Ed Uyeshima,"[18, 24]","For those who are afraid of taking the dark journey into the soul of the mid-eighties AIDS epidemic, this adventurous film will not allay your fears of experiencing its brutalizing effects and the unrelenting aftermath that holds us hostage to this day. What is surprising about this movie is that it captures not so much the play's dramatic impact (a given with this production's pedigree), but rather the epic sweep, fantastical elements and brittle humor with a heart-pumping gusto rare for any movie. But this is no ordinary movie given that playwright Tony Kushner wrote a groundbreaking two-play masterpiece over a decade ago that serves as a sweeping indictment of Reagan-era homophobia, medical apathy and social ignorance. It certainly doesn't hurt that legendary director Mike Nichols has guided this ambitious drama with an amazing cast that only starts with Al Pacino, Meryl Streep and Emma Thompson.The story primarily follows three characters whose lives intertwine - Prior, a young man dying of AIDS; his ex-boyfriend, Louis; and Joe, Roy Cohn's ambitious protege, a closeted Mormon married to a woman slipping into delusional depression while he starts an affair with Louis. The fictitious characters are counterweighted by a subplot that centers on Cohn, the demagogic McCarthy-era lawyer who willingly convicted the Rosenbergs and whose closeted promiscuity led him to his 1986 death from AIDS. In his heartfelt adaptation, Nichols allows Kushner's poetic soliloquies full reign and films New York City as an epic backdrop to depict an epochal time. With a six-hour running time, the story certainly takes its time winding through several stories to its conciliatory conclusion, but not a single moment seems wasted here. A major part of its pleasure is how unexpected the plot turns are and how seemingly jarring images and scenes gradually make sense within the torrential stream of the storyline.The acting is uniformly superb but not in a way that one would have expected. The veteran leads are predictably strong, yet they do not dominate the ensemble. As Cohn, Pacino rages like he was onstage in an Italian opera, seducing and poisoning everyone around him as he produces his own kind of virus in embodying the corrupted American Dream. Streep, as ever the acting chameleon, gets to play three characters - a pallor-white ghost of Ethel Rosenberg, a bravura turn as an aged rabbi and most significantly, Joe's repressed Mormon mother who unlike her son, gains greater self-awareness by the movie's end. Thompson gets to play three smaller roles in a stunning fashion equal to Pacino and Streep, most memorably as the angel crashing through Prior's ceiling. I have to admit though that as impressive as Streep and Thompson are, it is rather distracting to see them cast in multiple roles for their obvious versatility, which takes away somewhat from the veracity of the story.Regardless of the veterans' contributions, it is really the acting by the younger actors that makes this movie transcendant, especially since they have the bulk of the screen time. Justin Kirk, Ben Shenkman and especially Patrick Wilson are all excellent as Prior, Louis and Joe, respectively. Kirk avoids mawkishness with fiery intensity. Wilson gets kudos for greatly underplaying his role to haunting effect against the dramatic fireworks spewed on him in scenes with Pacino and Mary-Louise Parker. His sense of lost identity is palpable at the end. Parker movingly plays Joe's wife, Harper, who takes Valium to insulate herself from the world crashing around her. She mixes self-pity and humor seamlessly into a character that alternately rankles and cowers. And as the film's moral center in a blazing performance that cuts to the heart of the messages of intolerance and ignorance, Jeffrey Wright plays Belize, a flashy but truthful confidante to Prior and Louis and acerbic nurse to the dying Cohn. When the ensemble acting is at this high a level for six hours, it is hard to imagine what the effect of a mediocre performance would have had on such a potentially unwieldy project.There are a lot of grandstanding speeches of self-revelation that may alienate some viewers, especially those who may not be able to appreciate the story within its historical context. But I like to view ""Angels in America"" as grand opera with powerful themes that need to play to the back rows. It is impossible to think of a movie, much less a TV-movie, with a more ambitious emotional scope and a deeper sense of revelation. I only wish the DVD included extras commensurate with the production itself, but alas, that will happen in future commemorative editions, I'm sure.

Taylor ""GFT""","[37, 47]","Set in 1980s New York and subtitled ""A Gay Fantasia on National Themes,"" the six-hour ANGELS IN AMERICA concerns a group of largely gay men who find themselves caught up in series of disasters that range from love to religion and from politics to philosophy--and most specifically caught between the rising tide of AIDS and a generally unsympathetic society.In the midst of this, AIDS patient Prior Walter begins to have a series of visions, which may be fever dreams, medicine-induced hallucinations... or, most unnerving of all, real. His long dead ancestors rise to speak to him, the floor cracks open to reveal a burning book--and at the conclusion of the play's first half a beautiful woman with majestic wings crashes through his roof. She is the Angel of America. He is, she tells him, a prophet, and she has come to bring him a message for mankind.Intertwined with Prior's other-earthly experiences are oddly parallel lives. Joe and Harper Pitt are a deeply dysfunctional couple doubting their faith in the Mormon Church, Joe a closeted homosexual, Harper a valium-addicted and mildly psychotic woman given to visions as strange as those of Prior Walter's. And as further counterpoint historical figure Roy Cohn (1927-1986), among the most sinister figures of 20th Century America, finds himself taunted by the ghost of Ethel Rosenberg as he drifts toward his own AIDS-induced death. The characters swirl in and out of each other's lives and dreams, playing to stereotypes and yet defying them, arguing politics and philosophy and love and death--and it is fascinating stuff.Although the play stunned 1990s audiences, most considered it utterly unfilmable due to both length and content.  But this HBO-produced, Mike Nichols-directed version not only captures the power of the original, in some ways it improves upon it.  Playwright Tony Kushner has adapted his work to the screen, rearranging certain problematic scenes and bits of dialogue to better effect, and certainly no one could argue with the cast, which is absolutely stunning in a series of multiple roles.With a mad swirl of irony, intense drama, outrageous humor, and unexpected twists and turns, ANGELS IN AMERICA is almost sure to hold your attention--particularly if you recall the Ronald Reagan years well enough to recognize the truly bitter allegory the film offers on what many consider his largely absentee second term.  Truly a must have, multi-layered, bearing repeated viewings, beautifully directed, performed, and filmed.GFT, Amazon Reviewer",5,A Triumph In Every Way,1097107200,"10 7, 2004",2004,2525,"['Set', '1980s', 'New', 'York', 'subtitled', 'Gay', 'Fantasia', 'National', 'Themes', 'six-hour', 'ANGELS', 'IN', 'AMERICA', 'group', 'largely', 'gay', 'men', 'who', 'find', 'caught', 'up', 'series', 'disasters', 'range', 'love', 'religion', 'politics', 'philosophy', 'most', 'specifically', 'caught', 'rising', 'tide', 'AIDS', 'generally', 'unsympathetic', 'society.In', 'midst', 'AIDS', 'patient', 'Prior', 'Walter', 'have', 'series', 'visions', 'may', 'be', 'fever', 'dreams', 'medicine-induced', 'hallucinations', 'most', 'unnerving', 'real', 'long', 'dead', 'ancestors', 'rise', 'speak', 'floor', 'cracks', 'open', 'reveal', 'burning', 'book', 'conclusion', 'play', 'first', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'majestic', 'wings', 'crashes', 'roof', 'Angel', 'America', 'prophet', 'come', 'bring', 'message', 'mankind.Intertwined', 'Prior', 'other-earthly', 'experiences', 'are', 'oddly', 'parallel', 'lives', 'Joe', 'Harper', 'Pitt', 'are', 'deeply', 'dysfunctional', 'couple', 'doubting', 'faith', 'Mormon', 'Church', 'Joe', 'closeted', 'homosexual', 'Harper', 'valium-addicted', 'mildly', 'psychotic', 'woman', 'given', 'visions', 'as', 'strange', 'Prior', 'Walter', 'further', 'counterpoint', 'historical', 'figure', 'Roy', 'Cohn', '1927-1986', 'most', 'sinister', 'figures', '20th', 'Century', 'America', 'taunted', 'ghost', 'Ethel', 'Rosenberg', 'own', 'AIDS-induced', 'death', 'characters', 'swirl', 'other', 'lives', 'dreams', 'playing', 'stereotypes', 'yet', 'defying', 'arguing', 'politics', 'philosophy', 'love', 'death', 'fascinating', 'play', 'stunned', '1990s', 'audiences', 'most', 'considered', 'utterly', 'unfilmable', 'due', 'length', 'content', 'HBO-produced', 'Mike', 'Nichols-directed', 'version', 'not', 'only', 'power', 'original', 'ways', 'Playwright', 'Tony', 'Kushner', 'adapted', 'work', 'screen', 'rearranging', 'certain', 'problematic', 'scenes', 'bits', 'dialogue', 'better', 'effect', 'certainly', 'one', 'could', 'argue', 'cast', 'absolutely', 'stunning', 'series', 'multiple', 'roles.With', 'mad', 'swirl', 'irony', 'intense', 'drama', 'outrageous', 'humor', 'unexpected', 'twists', 'turns', 'ANGELS', 'IN', 'AMERICA', 'almost', 'sure', 'hold', 'attention', 'particularly', 'recall', 'Ronald', 'Reagan', 'years', 'well', 'enough', 'recognize', 'truly', 'bitter', 'allegory', 'film', 'offers', 'what', 'many', 'consider', 'largely', 'absentee', 'second', 'term', 'Truly', 'must', 'have', 'multi-layered', 'bearing', 'repeated', 'viewings', 'beautifully', 'directed', 'performed', 'filmed.GFT', 'Amazon', 'Reviewer']",Angels in America

805992,A328S9RN3U5M68,B0001I2BUI,Grady Harp,"[12, 19]","Part One: THE MILLENNIUM APPROACHESTony Kushner's ANGELS IN AMERICA created a major sensation when it was produced in the mid 1980s in New York and Los Angeles (and subsequently in theaters across the country). Not only is this a magnificently written drama whose seed lies in the agar plate of America in the time of Reagan, AIDS, post-Vietnam trauma, and general angst, it is presented in a long, two part production that demands much of the audience - not only in physical endurance, but in emotional vulnerability. That Kushner succeeded in making his points is evident in the continuing productions of his bipartite play. And now HBO has granted Director Mike Nichols a huge budget, his choice of the finest actors available, and an uncut presentation of this historically important work for television audiences. Yes, the experience is different when the play is transformed to film, but this transformation was with the complete blessing of Kushner so we must accept that this version is on target with Kushner's concepts.The story is so well known that it need not be summarized, other that it is a series of messages about mortality, moral decline, the exigencies of dealing with AIDS as a paradigm for the possible extinction of the human race, or more poetically - the millennium, and the importance of connection between souls in a time of terror. The cast is superb - yes, different from the stage production with the exception of the brilliant Jeffrey Wright - and Mike Nichols draws performances from such luminaries as Meryl Streep (a rabbi, as mother of the main character, Ethel Rosenberg), Emma Thompson (a street bum, the nurse, and the Angel Messenger), Al Pacino (in an inordinately affecting portrayal of the usually despicable Roy Cohn), Mary Louise Parker in her finest acting performance to date, and Justin Kirk as the lead. All of the ""minor"" roles (such as the uncredited Michael Gambon, Patrick Wilson, etc) are played to perfection, the appearance of delusional characters is splendid in a surreal, theatrical fashion, and the visual effects are compelling.After this satisfying Part One THE MILLENNIUM APPROACHES it is with great anticipation that we await Part Two PERESTROIKA. The play/film deals with challenging ideas and it is to the audience's credit that the work is being so well accepted. But enough said. The true brilliance is in the poetic writing of Tony Kushner who deserves every kudo and award available for this daring and provocative and wholly poignant masterwork.Part Two: PERESTROIKAPart Two of Tony Kushner's brilliant adaptation of his own play ANGELS IN AMERICA is in many ways more compelling than Part One, due in part to the stunning visual effects afforded film vs stage, but also because of the heightened writing level for his characters. The actors continue to create wholly three dimensional characters, each surpassing their own high standards. The lines are delivered in a nearShakespearean manner - but then the lines are WRITTEN with a near Shakespearean quality! (...)  three hours of an extended tale requires more room than this space allows. But the message is clear: ANGELS IN AMERICA is the most important work to appear on television. Mike Nichols direction, Thomas Newman's musical score (rapturously orchestrated by Thomas Pasatieri), and all the creators of the special effects and cinematography deserve Emmy Awards and more.

When Meryl Streep arrives in New York City from her Mormon homeland, to visit her son and question his strange behavior, the film improves considerably. She brings a much needed point of view to what has already been established as an ensemble of unlikeable characters threatened by the AIDS virus during the epidemic's early stages of development.  Not that Streep's character doesn't tow her own worldly baggage, but her ordinary yet not unquestioning life contrasts well with the troubled complications of the other characters. She's like a sigh of relief when all else is bated breath. Somewhere deeply involved in the second half, I had to ask myself if I'm enjoying the film because of the creativity involved or is this merely a good soap opera? And were the surreal scenes of a frustrated wife stepping into La-La Land, angels crashing through hospital ceilings, and the ghost of U.S. assasinated convicted spy Ethel Rosenberg walking around and offering advice, effective or merely indulgent? There's also a strange morality working here; a perceived as evil AIDS patient succumbs to the illness, while a good-hearted one survives; out and proud homosexuals are made heroic while a troubled one, guilted by his religious upbringing, is left out in the cold. An enthralling film with powerhouse characterizations, it finally doesn't all add up but it marches by proudly like lesser and greater parts of a passing parade.

It sounds contrived and unnatural. When Shakespeare's plays are transposed to films, the directors often find new ways, new settings, new mise-en-scene to match the metaphoric language but in the case of Angels in America (the series), the director does not and that's where it fails.Another thing that I do not understand is why Al Pacino is given the best actor in the Golden Globe over Douglas Kirk who plays a more central and convincing role.

Corbin ""Foster Corbin""","[22, 30]","Two hundred years from now, when the AIDS epidemic will be ancient history as both a vaccine has been developed and a cure found, when people want to know what the AIDS plague years of the 1980's were like, they can acquaint themselves with this marvelous work by Tony Kushner. This HBO production, directed by one of America's great directors Mike Nichols, (screenplay by the playwright) deserved every award it received. The acting is phenomenal. Meryl Streep literally becomes Ethel Rosenberg. The Roy Cohn deathbed scene where she recites the Kaddish is spellbinding. She is also perfect as Hannah, (such an Old Testament name) the Mormon mother. Of course she would wear sensible shoes and carry one of those awful rain scarves in her purse for rainy days. Al Pacino plays the vile Roy Cohn with everything he has. (Cohn was such a reprehensible human being that someone created a panel for him for the AIDS quilt that points out his awfulness, calling him a bigot as I recall.) Emma Thompson (we've all known someone just like her) is better as the nurse with a tattoo, too much eye makeup and a polyester nurse's uniform than as an angel. In the stage production, the angel's appearance is magical. You literally gasp when the angel, held up only by wires, first descends, appearing to Prior. That magic is difficult to translate to the screen and some of that wonderment is lost, as we get bogged down in the angel and heavenly scenes-- it's good to know however, that gay men go to San Francisco when they die-- but the film may ultimately belong to Jeffrey Wright who plays the effeminate African American nurse Belize.Mr. Kushner is so ambitious, tackling homophobia, racism, anti-Semitism, fundamentalist religion, closeted homosexuals, gay Republicans, the indifference of the Reagan administration to the first cases of AIDS because they were in the gay population and more-- and then friendship, the courage of the gay community, death and dying, love and ultimately hope. There are so many levels of meaning here and different plots that the playwright artfully brings together.There is much humor here (the memorial service for the ""glitter queen"", for example, and more sadness. Parts of this play with make you weep. Some scenes are almost too painful to watch. Many of the lines approach poetry. ANGELS IN AMERICA is simply the best thing ever written about AIDS.

While the angels and other examples of the supernatural are a central element of the film, I feel that they almost could have been eliminated. Take away Emma Thompson's angel and the other visions of Prior Walter, take away some of the lame made-for-tv-melodrama among the young gay men, take away Mary-Louise Parker's annoying characterization of gay Mormon lawyer's wife and you could have had an effective three hour film. I won't go into explaining all these elements because I assume that most reviewers have seen this film and simply want to express their opinion.  You could have had a great story centering on a scaled back account of Prior and Lou and Joe (with a different actress as his wife), Al Pacino as Roy Cohn, Meryl Streep as Joe's mother, and Jeffrey Wright as the nurse (forget about his  silly other role oboe-playing guide to Parker's supernatural excursions.  OK. Keep in the few minutes of Streep as a aged rabbi. That was good.  I like Emma Thompson but the film did not need her in the roles of a doctor (her accent doesn't work) and a street person and it DID NOT need her as the angel, because the film did NOT need the angel.  That said. Pacino steals the show as Roy Cohn and Streep is brilliant in all of her roles. (OK> I would keep her Ethel Rosenberg in Cohn's hallucinating.)

I was reluctant to rent this as I thought it would be a predictable, mindless and vulgar soap opera for urban gay people with little to interest anyone else. It is anything but. This is a story told with an epic sweep and deals intelligently - and sometimes brilliantly - with everything from politics, American immigrants, Roy Cohn, Mormonism, theology, angels, and family to the Reagan years and AIDS. I am anything but a liberal - I am a Bush conservative - but a great piece of writing is a great piece of writing no matter what the point of view. And ""Angels"" is a great script. This is a six hour movie but director Mike Nichols has it zipping along at such a fast clip that there isn't a dull moment. Don't let your distaste for (or boredom with) movies with gay sub-plots keep you from this one; you'll be missing out on a great film. The entrance of the Angel at the end of part one is unforgettable and one of the most spectacular pieces of film in the last decade. Pacino gives a great, intense performance as Roy Cohn that doesn't have him chewing up the scenery and becoming a parody of himself. Mary Louise Parker does a great job as Harper, the emotionally ill Mormon wife who comes across as Marie Osmond on ecstasy and LSD.

Having read the play, and having seen it on stage, I was still unprepared for this epic production.  I started crying during the first scenes.  Streep's speech at the funeral - the eulogy - was so emotional I couldn't hold back my tears.  It sounds so silly to say that Meryl Streep and Al Pacino are masterful, they're legends after all.  Still, their work here reminds everyone of their status and why they are so deservedly praised and heaped with so many accolades.  The rest of cast is outstanding.  Mary Louise Parker and Jeffrey Wright won both the Emmy Award and Golden Globes (as did Streep and Pacino) and are staggeringly good, as are Ben Shankman, Patrick Wilson and Emma Thompson.Kushner's writing is simply brilliant.

So when the movie came out (not until after I graduated) I was eager to see the whole thing. I didn't really know what to expect. A few 5-minute scenes don't explain much of a 6-hour story. And the back of the box says nothing.So... I was surprised. The gay men and AIDS theme was the only thing remotely grounded in reality. The angel, dreams, hallucinations, prophecies, a trip to heaven... you never really knew what was going on, and it was fascinating to watch, and analyze. Many of the actors played multiple roles. Most of the characters were likable, although some were deplorable. I felt the sex, nudity and obscenities were overdone. That really brings down the intelligence level of a good movie, in my opinion.

806003,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,B0001I2BUI,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[1, 2]","Welcome to New York in Reagan's time, in the days when Reagan declared that AIDS was a divine punishment to homosexuals. And AIDS are taking their toll on gay men in New York City. All kinds, from the prudent to the careless, from the loving and lovable to the hateful and spiteful. But indeed the film is not about that, them and their types, or even those who can afford AZT or not.It is about love and what love can be, how love can be revealed when confronted to some treachery, or what looks like some treachery though it is only fright in front of the disease for some or coming out of the closet for others. Add to that a new born homosexual who is a reaganite and a mormon at the same time, which is a lot against his new birth and a clear cut condemnation that will prevent him from being properly baptized and christened.Add to that a mormon mother taken in the whirlwind and whirlpool of this revelation and confrontation to death and how she will be able to cope for one and even save the day of several of them, including her own son. But even so, that's only one little part of the film. It then plays on the visions some have, on the angels some can see, all angels of death. Those angels take the shape of Ethel Rosenberg for the lawyer who managed to get her death penalty.The angels also take the shape of a real female angel with wings and all that is able to take a couple more to their death, lead them to the ladder, Jacob's ladder that leads straight up to heavens. But that both Christian and Jewish imagery and symbolism is not enough to satisfy the baroque taste of the director. Heaven is not going to be the garden you may think it is. It is a vast ruined temple and city where some clerk or even bureaucrats are managing the fate of the dead from behind a long table piled up with files and papers, and the prophet who is probably not as Jewish as many others refuses to abide by their decision and demands more life and he does go back to life, he resurrects in a way.And this leads to the end of Reagan, of the cold war, the perestroika and Gorbachev, and a new era in the world. If only they could have known this new era was going to lead to eight years of absolutely nightmarish regression, two wars, and a lot of terrorism amplified and multiplied by the war-mongering of a vengeful tribe of American politicians who did not deserve to be appointed to their positions, and I say appointed since they were not elected properly, at least for those who should have been elected. In retrospect the joy of 1990, January 1990 mind you, hardly three months after the fall of the Berlin Wall was going to be rather short-lived and be buried in the sex-play of a president and then the bellicose vengeful adventures of another.Altogether by far nearly sixteen years lost to the phantasms of two men. Yes the angels are in America, the angels of death that give you a wet dream first and lead you to death afterwards, the little death and the big death unified in one single jump into empty space and the fall through the cosmos. An amazing film that seems to reflect a whole period and at the same time to express the distantiation we have been able to build thanks to nearly twenty years of crisis and plain at times painful living.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",5,The future could have been so much better than our present,1211155200,"05 19, 2008",2008,3280,"['Welcome', 'New', 'York', 'Reagan', 'time', 'days', 'when', 'Reagan', 'declared', 'AIDS', 'was', 'divine', 'punishment', 'homosexuals', 'AIDS', 'are', 'taking', 'toll', 'gay', 'men', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'kinds', 'prudent', 'careless', 'loving', 'lovable', 'hateful', 'spiteful', 'indeed', 'film', 'not', 'types', 'even', 'who', 'can', 'afford', 'AZT', 'not.It', 'love', 'what', 'love', 'can', 'be', 'how', 'love', 'can', 'be', 'revealed', 'when', 'confronted', 'treachery', 'what', 'treachery', 'only', 'fright', 'front', 'disease', 'coming', 'closet', 'others', 'Add', 'new', 'born', 'homosexual', 'who', 'reaganite', 'mormon', 'same', 'time', 'lot', 'new', 'birth', 'clear', 'cut', 'condemnation', 'will', 'prevent', 'being', 'properly', 'baptized', 'christened.Add', 'mormon', 'mother', 'taken', 'whirlwind', 'whirlpool', 'revelation', 'confrontation', 'death', 'how', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'cope', 'one', 'even', 'save', 'day', 'several', 'including', 'own', 'son', 'even', 'so', 'only', 'one', 'little', 'part', 'film', 'then', 'visions', 'have', 'angels', 'can', 'see', 'angels', 'death', 'angels', 'take', 'shape', 'Ethel', 'Rosenberg', 'lawyer', 'who', 'managed', 'get', 'death', 'penalty.The', 'angels', 'also', 'take', 'shape', 'real', 'female', 'angel', 'wings', 'able', 'take', 'couple', 'more', 'death', 'lead', 'ladder', 'Jacob', 'ladder', 'straight', 'up', 'heavens', 'Christian', 'Jewish', 'imagery', 'symbolism', 'not', 'enough', 'satisfy', 'baroque', 'taste', 'director', 'Heaven', 'not', 'going', 'be', 'garden', 'may', 'think', 'vast', 'ruined', 'temple', 'city', 'where', 'clerk', 'even', 'bureaucrats', 'are', 'managing', 'fate', 'dead', 'long', 'table', 'piled', 'up', 'files', 'papers', 'prophet', 'who', 'probably', 'not', 'as', 'Jewish', 'many', 'others', 'refuses', 'abide', 'decision', 'more', 'life', 'go', 'back', 'life', 'way.And', 'end', 'Reagan', 'cold', 'war', 'perestroika', 'Gorbachev', 'new', 'era', 'world', 'only', 'could', 'have', 'known', 'new', 'era', 'was', 'going', 'lead', 'eight', 'years', 'absolutely', 'nightmarish', 'regression', 'two', 'wars', 'lot', 'terrorism', 'amplified', 'multiplied', 'war-mongering', 'vengeful', 'tribe', 'American', 'politicians', 'who', 'did', 'not', 'deserve', 'be', 'appointed', 'positions', 'say', 'appointed', 'were', 'not', 'elected', 'properly', 'least', 'who', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'elected', 'retrospect', 'joy', '1990', 'January', '1990', 'mind', 'hardly', 'three', 'months', 'fall', 'Berlin', 'Wall', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'rather', 'short-lived', 'be', 'buried', 'sex-play', 'president', 'then', 'bellicose', 'vengeful', 'adventures', 'another.Altogether', 'far', 'nearly', 'sixteen', 'years', 'lost', 'phantasms', 'two', 'men', 'Yes', 'angels', 'are', 'America', 'angels', 'death', 'give', 'wet', 'dream', 'first', 'lead', 'death', 'afterwards', 'little', 'death', 'big', 'death', 'unified', 'one', 'single', 'jump', 'empty', 'space', 'fall', 'cosmos', 'amazing', 'film', 'reflect', 'whole', 'period', 'same', 'time', 'express', 'distantiation', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'build', 'thanks', 'nearly', 'twenty', 'years', 'crisis', 'plain', 'times', 'painful', 'living.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU']",Angels in America
806004,A3RO6CB4EU8DRA,B0001I2BUI,James Head,"[10, 13]","There are so many things to say about ANGELS IN AMERICA, but each of them is as difficult to put into words as the last.  To all of those who found this 6-hour adaptation of the play boring, consider looking beyond the superficial oddness and confusing nature of the story to its core.  When you dig down deep, ANGELS is a story about coping with life, with heartbreak, with disease, and learning what it means to be human.With this said, ANGELS is anything but easy to understand.  Its references are as complex as they are hard-hitting, and it is as unforgivingly brutal in its honesty as it is right on the money.  The AIDS epidemic of the mid-1980s is the focus of the work -- but on a broader level, it's a study of how individuals live and function in modern day America.  The constant political references are apt to confuse all except the most politically-minded -- myself included -- so you may have to do a little reading and research to best understand the myriad references found herein.  Still, ANGELS is a full-force criticism of political neglect and ignorance -- things which still abound today.The storyline being as complex as it is, it's astounding to see such superb performances from the cast.  Pacino, Streep, Thompson, Kirk, Shenkman, Parker, and Wright give brilliant performances that should not be missed.  The anguish and strife of the time, combined with the difficulties of relationships and dealing with situations we simply have no control over, make this film a masterpiece of modern cinema.Make no mistake -- this film is not something you should watch with the assumption that you'll leave it with a smile on your face and a warm feeling in your heart.  It's honesty is piercing, and its sadness nearly heartbreaking.  Still, there is always hope -- we have an incredible resistance to change, and yet we're amazingly resilient creatures.  For better and for worse, we fight for what we believe -- as Prior says, we refuse to lay down anymore, to suffer and die in secrecy.With unsurpassed poignancy, Kushner produces a tale that is sometimes funny and often heartwrenching.  Thomas Newman's delicate compositions ring true in the background, as well -- his soundtrack is compelling and truly breathtaking.

806006,AL5OEDM8TPTKV,B0001I2BUI,James Hiller,"[15, 19]","The first scene in the amazing HBO film that may win you over is one of fantasy and illusion. Sick Prior, after taking some of his drugs, slips into a hallucination or a dream, and meets up with another drug induced character, Harper. Together, they commiserate about their sad, pathetic lives and how they see into each other. The acting, fantastic, the drama, superb, its reality in its unreality is brilliant. Long anticipated, long awaited, the landmark play of the 90's, Angels in America finally comes to DVD with astounding results.Tony Kushner's play, produced in the early to mid 90's, is both a damning indictment on the lack of response to the early AIDS crisis, to a celebration of those who survive and continue to live with the disease. It's a brilliant work that is not easily understood, but upon several viewings, and even readings of the play, allows the layers and filters of this incredible drama to infuse itself into your own psyche, and by merely watching it, you are changed. Angels quite possibly is the quintessential drama ever produced.Through a handful of characters, the themes of despair, continuance, andredemption is explored. Mormon Joe Pitt struggles with his sexuality, while married to knowing-yet-unknowing wife Harper, who struggles with her drug addiction. Prior Walter, struggling with AIDS, must deal with his prophetic status, while dealing with less than supportive boyfriend Louis. Prior's story is countered by arch-conservative real life attorney Roy Cohn, who fails to acknowledge his own struggle with AIDS. Additional characters include Belize, a former drag queen and current nurse, and Joe's mother Hannah, herself coming out of her Mormon upbringing who probably deals with reality the best of them all.Given the brilliant script, the acting soars above anything seen recently on television. Screen stars Al Pacino and Meryl Streep powerhouse their characters, making them incredibly real. Justin Kirk as Prior and Ben Shenkman as Louis both prove their acting chops by being the center of the film and carry it extremely well. The first scene where they discuss Prior's illness sets the tone for the entire film. However, two performances absolutely stunned me. Mary Louise Parker as Harper, makes her character, which reads as a crazy lunatic, more heartbreakingly honest and internal pain. And Jeffrey Wright as Belize harnesses the anger and resentment of the entire gay community with his beautiful performance. He perhaps is the most underappreciated American actor today, and I don't know why we don't see him in many more things.Angels isn't for everyone. Those easily offended by religious plays, homosexuality, or AIDS would best steer clear. However, if you want a movie that will reduce you to tears many times, where you love the script and the acting, I highly suggest Angels in America.

806007,A1C08KLFIHSJMZ,B0001I2BUI,Jason G.,"[18, 22]","I'll be blunt: this miniseries nearly left me in pieces after I completed it in one night. I was tired and irritable thte following day at school, but it didn't matter. 'Angels' is one of the finest miniseries in recent memory, and like Roots, is an absolute must have for your library.Capturing the 1980's in an entertaining fashion, the film centers around the lives of three groups: homosexual couple Louis and Prior, disgruntled husband/wife Joe and Harper (though Joe happens to be a closeted homosexual himself, and a mormon too--sheesh) and the notorious lawyer Roy Cohn.As Prior is diagnosed with AIDS in a time when the disease was met with both fear and ignorance, Louis leaves him and seeks a relationship with Joe, all the while when his wife Harper is having what is either a series of hallucinations or heavenly visions--we are left to decide.While in the throes of agonizing pain, Prior is visited by a true angel, sent from heaven to seek out "" the prophet"" in order to do good in a world that had gone so wrong.The miniseries, six hours long, covers a multitude of topics, from AIDS and sexuality to mental illnes and politics, all the while never straying from its true path: to enlighten those who might have otherwise remained ignorant as to the millions of Americans who suffer from AIDS. For they truly are the Angels of America, citizens who face an uncertain future with the bravery and compassion that many of us will never come to know.The performances are outstanding, featuring an all star cast of Meryl Streep, Al Pacino, Patrick Wilson and Mary Louise Parker, to name a few. Truly a virtuoso performance by all those involved, they truly carried the miniseries to dizzying heights, and far exceeded my expectations.While I would like to think one day this miniseries will be shown in High Schools across the country, for now, I absolutely insist that you either rent, purchase or borrow this work of art in the near future.

Pouliot,"[0, 3]","In spite of a few imperfection (intentional or otherwise) ""Angels in America"" was one of the most original and heartfelt works to have graced the American stage. AiA, the film, ably brings the play to the screen. It is original. It is funny. It is poignant. It is crude and even blasphemous. Above all it is honest. It is everything a non-religious religious movie ought to be.In Ronald Reagan's America, the AIDS epidemic was cutting down young gay lives at a furious clip. Caught between the spread of a virulent infection and a society that relegated it to the margins, the [...] community was reeling. Treatments were rare, and those that existed were limited to drug trials, to which only the very lucky or the very powerful had access. It's against this backdrop of death and identity that AiA is set.Playwright Tony Kushner does not paint every gay character as a saint or a hero. Some are power-mad, some cowardly, some just trying to survive, while some step up in best Florence Nightingale fashion to alleviate pain and bring hope. The film cuts between sets of lovers. Prior is suffering with AIDS, but his squeamish friend Louis (great when it comes to pronouncing sweeping theories) is unable to support Prior during his illness. A young Mormon couple-Joe and Harper-struggle through madness and a sexless marriage, mostly due to Joe's inability to accept his own sexuality. Al Pacino, in an Oscar-worthy performance, plays Roy Cohn as a man in love with himself and with power, who vehemently denies his [...], even as his body is being ravaged by HIV/AIDS. Throughout the personal struggles, the principals are beset by visions that challenge them, comfort them and give meaning to their suffering. Meryl Streep is perfect as Ethel Rosenberg-the voice of Kohn's withered conscience-whom an overzealous Kohn had railroaded (as AIA tells it) to the gas chamber. Prior is visited by Emma Thompson, as an angel who proclaims him a prophet. Harper retreats into drugged-out hallucinations that protect her from her own feelings of uselessness and worthless. Special mention goes to Jeffrey Wright, who plays nurse Belize, who ministers to his sick friends (and enemies) while doling out tough love that keeps them grounded in reality.Redemption for these characters comes in facing truths about their characters. Those who accept the truth find peace and love; those who reject it, like Cohn, are doomed to die alone in their lies.AiA is a masterpiece that uses the AIDS epidemic to strip away the masks of self-delusion and falsity that are the hallmark of humanity and the special curse of [...] in a homophobic society. The film's depictions of gay sexuality are frank and not always pretty. But by exposing the inner, hidden core of [...] humanity, the film shows [...] as persons of full human dignity who do not deserve suffering and death, but who soldier through its ravages with grace, love and courage.",5,"""Angels"" that need to be heard on high and on low",1135641600,"12 27, 2005",2005,2922,"['spite', 'few', 'imperfection', 'intentional', 'otherwise', 'Angels', 'America', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'original', 'heartfelt', 'works', 'have', 'graced', 'American', 'stage', 'AiA', 'film', 'ably', 'play', 'screen', 'original', 'funny', 'poignant', 'crude', 'even', 'blasphemous', 'honest', 'everything', 'non-religious', 'religious', 'movie', 'ought', 'be.In', 'Ronald', 'Reagan', 'America', 'AIDS', 'epidemic', 'was', 'cutting', 'down', 'young', 'gay', 'furious', 'clip', 'Caught', 'spread', 'virulent', 'infection', 'society', 'relegated', 'margins', '[', ']', 'community', 'was', 'reeling', 'Treatments', 'were', 'rare', 'existed', 'were', 'limited', 'drug', 'trials', 'only', 'very', 'lucky', 'very', 'powerful', 'had', 'access', 'backdrop', 'death', 'identity', 'AiA', 'set.Playwright', 'Tony', 'Kushner', 'not', 'paint', 'gay', 'character', 'saint', 'hero', 'are', 'power-mad', 'cowardly', 'just', 'trying', 'survive', 'step', 'up', 'best', 'Florence', 'Nightingale', 'fashion', 'alleviate', 'pain', 'bring', 'hope', 'film', 'cuts', 'sets', 'lovers', 'Prior', 'suffering', 'AIDS', 'squeamish', 'friend', 'Louis', 'great', 'when', 'pronouncing', 'sweeping', 'theories', 'unable', 'support', 'Prior', 'illness', 'young', 'Mormon', 'couple-Joe', 'Harper-struggle', 'madness', 'sexless', 'marriage', 'mostly', 'due', 'Joe', 'inability', 'accept', 'own', 'sexuality', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'Oscar-worthy', 'performance', 'Roy', 'Cohn', 'man', 'love', 'power', 'who', 'vehemently', '[', ']', 'even', 'body', 'being', 'ravaged', 'HIV/AIDS', 'personal', 'struggles', 'principals', 'are', 'beset', 'visions', 'challenge', 'comfort', 'give', 'meaning', 'suffering', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'perfect', 'Ethel', 'Rosenberg-the', 'voice', 'Kohn', 'withered', 'conscience-whom', 'overzealous', 'Kohn', 'had', 'railroaded', 'AIA', 'gas', 'chamber', 'Prior', 'visited', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'angel', 'who', 'prophet', 'Harper', 'drugged-out', 'hallucinations', 'protect', 'own', 'feelings', 'uselessness', 'worthless', 'Special', 'mention', 'Jeffrey', 'Wright', 'who', 'nurse', 'Belize', 'who', 'sick', 'friends', 'enemies', 'doling', 'out', 'tough', 'love', 'grounded', 'reality.Redemption', 'characters', 'facing', 'truths', 'characters', 'who', 'accept', 'truth', 'find', 'peace', 'love', 'who', 'reject', 'Cohn', 'are', 'doomed', 'die', 'alone', 'lies.AiA', 'masterpiece', 'AIDS', 'epidemic', 'strip', 'away', 'masks', 'self-delusion', 'falsity', 'are', 'hallmark', 'humanity', 'special', 'curse', '[', ']', 'homophobic', 'society', 'film', 'depictions', 'gay', 'sexuality', 'are', 'frank', 'not', 'always', 'pretty', 'exposing', 'inner', 'hidden', 'core', '[', ']', 'humanity', 'film', '[', ']', 'persons', 'full', 'human', 'dignity', 'who', 'do', 'not', 'deserve', 'suffering', 'death', 'who', 'soldier', 'ravages', 'grace', 'love', 'courage']",Angels in America

806010,A1QHEQII6QRVND,B0001I2BUI,J.G.,"[33, 97]","Tony Kushner's ""Angels in America"" is one of the most depressing films I've ever seen. Not so much for the pathetic list of self-loathing characters that are paraded before the hapless viewer, but for its sickening moralizing that American culture is to blame for all the world's woes, including AIDS. Kushner, a self-proclaimed socialist, doesn't condemn America for being not liberal enough; he criticizes America for being too liberal. ""Angels in America"" exposes an intense anger toward a society that permits far too much liberty. Living in a free society means one has to be responsible for one's own actions--and this Kushner detests. Freedom of choice means one might make the wrong decision. In America one has to weigh one's choices and live with the consequences. If you choose to go to a gay bath house and engage in sex with strangers rather than go to the library and read a volume of Walt Whitman's poetry, there will be different consequences for your actions. The freedom is yours. But Kushner hates freedom. Hence, his love affair with communist spy Ethel Rosenberg. Kushner conjures up dead communist spy Ethel Rosenberg in the form of an angel (played by Meryl Streep) who visits a suffering AIDS patient. His saintly portrayal of a woman who sold American military secrets to Soviets during the 1950 reveals just how deep Kushner's contempt for American society lies. Although Kushner only sees evil at all levels of American society, it was in socialist Cuba where dictator Fidel Castro was putting homosexuals in mental hospitals and prisons in order to contain AIDS there. Kushner accepts these Draconian actions taken by Castro. Papa Castro and Kushner are of the same ilk. It is free will and liberty which are the villains. Society needs restraints, defined moral structures, a ""papa"" to tell us from right and wrong so that we do not end up making the wrong choices. It is telling that the only redeemable character in this film is a masculine, independent, self-sufficient professional attorney and Mormon who has come to openly accept his homosexuality. This character is the ""all-American"" male: good-looking, strong, virile, self-sufficient, capable of making his own way. But in Kushner's world, these are evil attributes. In typical Leftist fashion, self-sufficiency, strength and independence are vilified as ""bourgeois"" and the character is degraded for failing to understand the ""big picture"" of socialist Utopianism. But whatever the case, the crux of ""Angels in America"" (the Angels, by the way, are the communists who walk among us evil capitalists) is a complete hatred for freedom and individuality.

806014,A3SLA4ADDSYZJ2,B0001I2BUI,Josh Hitchens,"[5, 11]","Tony Kushner's ""Angels in America"" is without doubt one of the best plays ever written. There is almost nothing in contemporary literature that compares to Kushner's ambitious ""fantasia on national themes,"" blending gay men dying of AIDS, unhappy housewives, Mormons, Jews, Angels, Roy Cohn and Ethel Rosenberg into one exhilarating meditation on religion and politics in America. The film version of ""Angels in America"" is a long time in the making, and comes to us directed by Mike Nichols, written by Kushner, and a stellar cast that includes Al Pacino, Meryl Streep, Emma Thompson, Jeffrey Wright, Mary-Louise Parker, Justin Kirk, Ben Shenkman, and Patrick Wilson. At six hours, it is a complex, emotionally wrenching and thought-provoking piece of work that shows indelibly the true greatness that television is capable of.""Angels in America"" takes place in New York City in 1985, a time when people and cultures are coming together and relationships are being torn apart. Prior Walter (Justin Kirk) is dying of AIDS and his longtime lover Louis (Ben Shenkman) leaves him. Closeted lawyer Joe Pitt (Patrick Wilson) works for the ferocious and manipulative Roy Cohn (Al Pacino), a homosexual with AIDS who never admits his orientation. Joe's wife Harper (Mary-Louise Parker) is addicted to Valium and is profoundly unhappy, and when she disappears Joe's stalwart mother Hannah (Meryl Streep) moves to New York to pick up the pieces. As Prior is hospitalized, he is cared for by Belize (Jeffrey Wright) an ex-drag queen, and begins to have terrifying visions of an Angel, played by Emma Thompson.""Millennium Approaches"" and ""Perestroika"" form the two parts of this epic film about sex, politics, religion, and forgiveness. The first half sets centers around relationships falling apart, only to be reborn during the second half. The acting is amazing all around. Al Pacino gives his best performance in years as the evil but still human Roy Cohn. Meryl Streep amazes in her three major roles as Hannah Pitt, the ghost of Ethel Rosenberg, and an aged Rabbi, and Jeffrey Wright is stunning as he recreates his stage role of Belize. Patrick Wilson and Mary-Louise Parker are also very solid, and Emma Thompson is glorious as the Angel. Justin Kirk and Ben Shenkman are uneven, but mostly very good. The screenplay is perfect, and Mike Nichols' direction is superbly imaginative.""Angels in America"" will likely be viewed and discussed for decades. It is occaisionally too studied, as if the creators couldn't stop thinking that they were adapting a Great Work of Art, but when this movie lets go of that and soars, it is breathtaking to behold. Although it does have its flaws, the good points ultimately outnumber the bad, and its sheer ambition and epic scope make it well worth seeing.Winner of 11 Emmys including: Best Miniseries, Best Director, Best Screenplay, Best Actor (Pacino), Best Actress (Streep), Best Supporting Actor (Wright), and Best Supporting Actress (Parker).",5,There are Angels in America,1096243200,"09 27, 2004",2004,2979,"['Tony', 'Kushner', 'Angels', 'America', 'doubt', 'one', 'best', 'plays', 'ever', 'written', 'almost', 'nothing', 'contemporary', 'literature', 'Kushner', 'ambitious', 'fantasia', 'national', 'themes', 'blending', 'gay', 'men', 'dying', 'AIDS', 'unhappy', 'housewives', 'Mormons', 'Jews', 'Angels', 'Roy', 'Cohn', 'Ethel', 'Rosenberg', 'one', 'exhilarating', 'meditation', 'religion', 'politics', 'America', 'film', 'version', 'Angels', 'America', 'long', 'time', 'making', 'directed', 'Mike', 'Nichols', 'written', 'Kushner', 'stellar', 'cast', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'Jeffrey', 'Wright', 'Mary-Louise', 'Parker', 'Justin', 'Kirk', 'Ben', 'Shenkman', 'Patrick', 'Wilson', 'six', 'hours', 'complex', 'emotionally', 'wrenching', 'thought-provoking', 'piece', 'work', 'indelibly', 'true', 'greatness', 'television', 'capable', 'Angels', 'America', 'place', 'New', 'York', 'City', '1985', 'time', 'when', 'people', 'cultures', 'are', 'coming', 'together', 'relationships', 'are', 'being', 'torn', 'apart', 'Prior', 'Walter', 'Justin', 'Kirk', 'dying', 'AIDS', 'longtime', 'lover', 'Louis', 'Ben', 'Shenkman', 'Closeted', 'lawyer', 'Joe', 'Pitt', 'Patrick', 'Wilson', 'ferocious', 'manipulative', 'Roy', 'Cohn', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'homosexual', 'AIDS', 'who', 'never', 'orientation', 'Joe', 'wife', 'Harper', 'Mary-Louise', 'Parker', 'addicted', 'Valium', 'profoundly', 'unhappy', 'when', 'Joe', 'stalwart', 'mother', 'Hannah', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'New', 'York', 'pick', 'up', 'pieces', 'Prior', 'hospitalized', 'cared', 'Belize', 'Jeffrey', 'Wright', 'ex-drag', 'queen', 'have', 'terrifying', 'visions', 'Angel', 'played', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'Millennium', 'Approaches', 'Perestroika', 'form', 'two', 'parts', 'epic', 'film', 'sex', 'politics', 'religion', 'forgiveness', 'first', 'half', 'centers', 'relationships', 'falling', 'apart', 'only', 'be', 'reborn', 'second', 'half', 'acting', 'amazing', 'around', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'best', 'performance', 'years', 'evil', 'still', 'human', 'Roy', 'Cohn', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'three', 'major', 'roles', 'Hannah', 'Pitt', 'ghost', 'Ethel', 'Rosenberg', 'aged', 'Rabbi', 'Jeffrey', 'Wright', 'stunning', 'stage', 'role', 'Belize', 'Patrick', 'Wilson', 'Mary-Louise', 'Parker', 'are', 'also', 'very', 'solid', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'glorious', 'Angel', 'Justin', 'Kirk', 'Ben', 'Shenkman', 'are', 'uneven', 'mostly', 'very', 'good', 'screenplay', 'perfect', 'Mike', 'Nichols', 'direction', 'superbly', 'imaginative', 'Angels', 'America', 'will', 'likely', 'be', 'viewed', 'discussed', 'decades', 'occaisionally', 'too', 'studied', 'creators', 'could', ""n't"", 'stop', 'thinking', 'were', 'adapting', 'Great', 'Work', 'Art', 'when', 'movie', 'go', 'soars', 'breathtaking', 'behold', 'have', 'flaws', 'good', 'points', 'ultimately', 'outnumber', 'bad', 'sheer', 'ambition', 'epic', 'scope', 'make', 'well', 'worth', 'seeing.Winner', '11', 'Emmys', 'including', 'Best', 'Miniseries', 'Best', 'Director', 'Best', 'Screenplay', 'Best', 'Actor', 'Pacino', 'Best', 'Actress', 'Streep', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actor', 'Wright', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actress', 'Parker']",Angels in America
806015,A28GCEHD00JFZG,B0001I2BUI,Julian Kennedy,"[2, 4]","Angels in America: 6/10: The play Angels in America must have had a much greater impact in the nineties then the miniseries has today. It also probably worked better as a play. That said; this is one of the more creative adaptations of theater one is likely to see on the small screen.Mike Nichols deserves great praise for making the stage bound fly. He over reaches occasionally but the effect is memorizing. Al Pacino, Meryl Streep and Justin Kirk all shine. While the brilliant Jeffery Wright simply steals every scene he is in. Mary Louise Parker and relative newcomer Patrick Wilson are unfortunately saddled with a disposable story that does not really fit in with the rest of the play. In fact, poor Mr. Wilson simply disappears for the last third or so of the miniseries while his characters mother played by Meryl Streep takes center stage.Pacino's Roy Cohn is hammy and not played as evil as he was in the original play. While Cohn has been more forgotten than redeemed since the play first came out; his nemesis Ethel Rosenberg's (Streep again) reputation has suffered greatly since the mid-nineties. While Pacino is very good, Streep is simply brilliant in the very well written role of a Mormon mother lost in New York. Her character simply surprises both the other characters and the audience by not sticking to our preconceived notions.Two actors however do drop the ball. Emma Thompson simply does not make a good angel. She is not helped by the fact that the angel moves around like Peter Pan in a junior high school production. As a result many of the angel scenes simply do not work.The other problematic performance is Ben Shenkman as Louis. One quickly has sympathy for every character that suffers with an encounter with Shenkman. Unfortunately the audience suffers the most screen time with this horrible persona. The character is simply evil. That self centered, banal evil one finds in real life. This is of course fine in a film, but Shenkman the actor doesn't seem to realize how repellent his character's actions are. Instead of developing the evil he simply pulls out Jewish stereotypes. Compare this to Pacino's entertaining vision of evil in the persona of Mr. Cohn.Creative and surprisingly fun Angels in America does run a little long (as a miniseries is wont to do) but is worth a look.",3,"Angel's in the ""Out"" Field",1248825600,"07 29, 2009",2009,2321,"['Angels', 'America', '6/10', 'play', 'Angels', 'America', 'must', 'have', 'had', 'much', 'greater', 'impact', 'nineties', 'then', 'miniseries', 'today', 'also', 'probably', 'worked', 'better', 'play', 'said', 'one', 'more', 'creative', 'adaptations', 'theater', 'one', 'likely', 'see', 'small', 'screen.Mike', 'Nichols', 'great', 'praise', 'making', 'stage', 'bound', 'fly', 'occasionally', 'effect', 'memorizing', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'Justin', 'Kirk', 'shine', 'brilliant', 'Jeffery', 'Wright', 'simply', 'scene', 'Mary', 'Louise', 'Parker', 'relative', 'newcomer', 'Patrick', 'Wilson', 'are', 'unfortunately', 'saddled', 'disposable', 'story', 'not', 'really', 'fit', 'rest', 'play', 'fact', 'poor', 'Mr.', 'Wilson', 'simply', 'last', 'third', 'so', 'miniseries', 'characters', 'mother', 'played', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'center', 'stage.Pacino', 'Roy', 'Cohn', 'hammy', 'not', 'played', 'as', 'evil', 'was', 'original', 'play', 'Cohn', 'been', 'more', 'forgotten', 'redeemed', 'play', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'nemesis', 'Ethel', 'Rosenberg', 'Streep', 'again', 'reputation', 'suffered', 'greatly', 'mid-nineties', 'Pacino', 'very', 'good', 'Streep', 'simply', 'brilliant', 'very', 'well', 'written', 'role', 'Mormon', 'mother', 'lost', 'New', 'York', 'character', 'simply', 'other', 'characters', 'audience', 'not', 'sticking', 'preconceived', 'notions.Two', 'actors', 'however', 'do', 'drop', 'ball', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'simply', 'not', 'make', 'good', 'angel', 'not', 'helped', 'fact', 'angel', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'junior', 'high', 'school', 'production', 'result', 'many', 'angel', 'scenes', 'simply', 'do', 'not', 'work.The', 'other', 'problematic', 'performance', 'Ben', 'Shenkman', 'Louis', 'One', 'quickly', 'sympathy', 'character', 'suffers', 'encounter', 'Shenkman', 'Unfortunately', 'audience', 'most', 'screen', 'time', 'horrible', 'persona', 'character', 'simply', 'evil', 'self', 'centered', 'banal', 'evil', 'one', 'real', 'life', 'course', 'fine', 'film', 'Shenkman', 'actor', ""n't"", 'seem', 'realize', 'how', 'repellent', 'character', 'actions', 'are', 'Instead', 'developing', 'evil', 'simply', 'out', 'Jewish', 'stereotypes', 'Compare', 'Pacino', 'entertaining', 'vision', 'evil', 'persona', 'Mr.', 'Cohn.Creative', 'surprisingly', 'fun', 'Angels', 'America', 'run', 'little', 'long', 'miniseries', 'wont', 'do', 'look']",Angels in America

And for those who think this is uncalled for Republican bashing, well, in 1985, 25,000 people had already died of AIDS and the Reagan administration was trying to pretend that it didn't exist. In fact, it was over five years after the first published reports of AIDS appeared, that Reagan actually made a public statement about it. By the time the govt really acted, AIDS had spread into far and wide, way beyond the gay community. But because in the early days, it was restricted to gay men and IV drug users, the conservatives Republicans in power looked at AIDS as a ""moral"" issue. So now, is there any reason to wonder why there was so much Republican bashing in this movie? You have to look at things in their historical context.This is one of the best productions I have ever seen.

Walsh ""lilgracie346""","[7, 10]","It never ceases to amaze me that people become so violently upset when art (whether it be film, television, paintings, or theater) does not take a ""balanced"" stance on an issue.  Art is ART, not fact.  Get over yourselves.  If you don't agree with what a particular piece of art has to say, then fine.  But there's no reason to write a 1500 word diatribe bashing the author, the performers, and the entire message because you don't agree with it.  Open your mind.  How can you appreciate any art otherwise?All of this aside, Angels in America is a stunningly filmed and acted piece of personal storytelling.  It deftly manages the concept of the personal being political as it weaves the stories of the characters into and out of one another.  Angels understands the human condition - both physically and emotionally.  The story is not afraid to let people be sick, bleeding, hurt, and broken.  It is also not afraid to let them be racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, religious zealots or atheists.  The characters of Angels experience love, hate, fear, sadness, anger, anxiety, frustration, and pain.  Even without the overarching presence of the AIDS virus within the story, the characters of Angels clearly demonstrate the human condition in which we each find ourselves.  That's what's so amazing about this piece - even though it deals primarily with gay men and their relationships, it does't cast these people as only that.  These men (and a few women) demonstrate an number of behaviors to which each of us can relate - gay or straight, sick or not.

806021,A136MAOWGCU2C2,B0001I2BUI,K.T. May,"[1, 1]","First off, I have to say that Justin Kirk did an amazing job here, a performance that is often mentioned secondary to those of the more established actors in the film (Pacino, Thompson, and Streep).  I loved Kirk as Andy on Weeds, and he is just as fantastic here - perhaps more so.  Ben Shenkman was equally incredible, as was Jeffrey Wright.  Belize and Prior were, without question, my favorite characters in the film.While I can understand the dislike many felt toward Louis (Shenkman's character), I could also accept where he was coming from and why he did the things he did.  No character here was an evil person - well, maybe with the exception of Roy Cohn.I approached this miniseries with hesitation due to its length - it's a lot to ask to devote six hours of your time of the same topic, especially when you're not sure whether or not it is quality material - but I was instantly riveted.  I completed the first three hours yesterday and could not wait to finish the last three hours today.  Angels in America unabashedly explores the very fabric of what makes us human, and while at times it does get a bit weird with Prior and Harper's fever dreams/hallucinations, the film is simply spell-binding.  You can appreciate why actors like Streep and Pacino are so revered, as there are often scenes in which they convey so much with nothing more than the shift of a glance.I am not familiar with the play on which this miniseries was based, but from the light research I have done, the miniseries does appear to be a fantastic, true-to-form adaptation (and having Kushner write the screenplay was probably a huge help in that regard).  I wanted to see this film years ago, and I'm sorry it took me this long to get around to it, but this is certainly a case of &#34;better late than never.&#34;  If this film were a person, I'd hug it.",5,Simply Wonderful,1401321600,"05 29, 2014",2014,1845,"['First', 'have', 'say', 'Justin', 'Kirk', 'did', 'amazing', 'job', 'here', 'performance', 'often', 'mentioned', 'secondary', 'more', 'established', 'actors', 'film', 'Pacino', 'Thompson', 'Streep', 'loved', 'Kirk', 'Andy', 'Weeds', 'just', 'fantastic', 'here', 'perhaps', 'more', 'so', 'Ben', 'Shenkman', 'was', 'equally', 'incredible', 'was', 'Jeffrey', 'Wright', 'Belize', 'Prior', 'were', 'question', 'favorite', 'characters', 'film.While', 'can', 'understand', 'dislike', 'many', 'felt', 'Louis', 'Shenkman', 'character', 'could', 'also', 'accept', 'where', 'was', 'coming', 'why', 'did', 'things', 'did', 'No', 'character', 'here', 'was', 'evil', 'person', 'well', 'maybe', 'exception', 'Roy', 'Cohn.I', 'approached', 'miniseries', 'hesitation', 'due', 'length', 'lot', 'ask', 'devote', 'six', 'hours', 'time', 'same', 'topic', 'especially', 'when', ""'re"", 'not', 'sure', 'not', 'quality', 'material', 'was', 'instantly', 'riveted', 'completed', 'first', 'three', 'hours', 'yesterday', 'could', 'not', 'wait', 'finish', 'last', 'three', 'hours', 'today', 'Angels', 'America', 'unabashedly', 'very', 'fabric', 'what', 'human', 'times', 'get', 'bit', 'weird', 'Prior', 'Harper', 'fever', 'dreams/hallucinations', 'film', 'simply', 'spell-binding', 'can', 'appreciate', 'why', 'actors', 'Streep', 'Pacino', 'are', 'so', 'revered', 'are', 'often', 'scenes', 'convey', 'so', 'much', 'nothing', 'more', 'shift', 'glance.I', 'am', 'not', 'familiar', 'play', 'miniseries', 'was', 'based', 'light', 'research', 'have', 'done', 'miniseries', 'appear', 'be', 'fantastic', 'true-to-form', 'adaptation', 'having', 'Kushner', 'write', 'screenplay', 'was', 'probably', 'huge', 'help', 'regard', 'wanted', 'see', 'film', 'years', 'ago', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'took', 'long', 'get', 'certainly', 'case', '34', 'better', 'late', 'never.', '34', 'film', 'were', 'person', ""'d"", 'hug']",Angels in America

Questions are asked and like in everyday life there are no clear cut answers. But the questions are provocative and the answers we do get are enlightening, and they lead to other questions.  Sometimes in life the destination isn't the goal, but the journey to get there.  All we really know how to do is survive because that's all we can do and sometimes that's enough.This film is also poinant because right now in 2004 there are people out there who think AIDS and the devastating effects it has on people is over because a few drug companies have come up with something that works for some (not all).  Angels in America brings it back down to the human level of suffering, while at the same time asking us exalted questions not only about faith and destiny put the level of that faith, and our understanding of our destiny.Who we are isn't dictated to us by the level of our adversity, but by how we address it.

806023,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B0001I2BUI,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[24, 33]","I have long held that the major strength of dramatic television programming is the able to tell extended narratives. I am thinking not only of the mini-series and such epic classics as ""Shogun"" and ""Lonesome Dove,"" but of traditional dramatic television series that create lengthy story arcs, such as ""Wiseguy"" and ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer."" I shudder to think of ""Angels in America"" reduced to a theatrical film half as long and you know full well that network television would have censored the script beyond recognition. Only HBO could have done this and they deserve all the plaudits they are getting after having swept every major category it was nominated for, including all four acting honors as well as Best Miniseries, Directing, and Writing.""Angels in America"" was originally two full-length plays by Tony Kushner, ""Part I: Millennium Approaches,"" which won the 1993 Pulitzer Prize for Drama, ""Part II: Perestroika,"" which won the Tony Award. Taken together the plays look at ""the state of the nation"" in 1985 when the AIDS epidemic was exploding during the Reagan years. Two of the main characters in the drama have AIDS. Prior Walter (Justin Kirk) is a reasonable young man who has to wonder if he has gone insane as he is visited by the ghosts of his ancestors with the same name and an angel (Emma Thompson). The other is Roy Cohn (Al Pacino), the infamous lawyer from the McCarthy Hearings and the Rosenberg trial, a hateful powerbroker who insists his doctor (James Cromwell) treat him for ""liver cancer"" because only powerless people get AIDS.These two characters are intertwined with the lives of others who come into play in various and often surprising combinations. Joe Pitt (Patrick Wilson) is a lawyer at Cohn's firm, a Mormon who closes his eyes when he makes love to his wife, Harper (Mary-Louise Parker), because he is imagining she is a man. Louis Ironson (Ben Shenkman) is unable to cope with what is happening to Prior, his lover, and while he walks away he is so consumed by guilt he engages in high-risk behavior. Belize (Jeffrey Wright) is a caring and compassionate African-American gay nurse while Hannah Pitt (Meryl Streep), Joe's mother, arrives from Utah when Joe confesses in a middle of the night phone call that he has left his wife and is a homosexual.Kushner is able to cover the spectrum of reactions to AIDS, both by those who have the disease and those around them. There is also the clear undercurrent that the nation's reaction to the epidemic is both political and prejudiced. However, with a title like ""Angels in America"" you know that there will be a strong religious element as well, from the rabbi who opens the play talking about how nothing ever really melts in the American ""melting pot"" to the revelations that God has abandoned his creation (it happened at the time of the San Francisco earthquake) and that Prior has been chosen to act as a prophet and help the world return to the ""good old days."" However, Prior refuses to act as the angels want and has a few choice suggestions for them instead.The true angels in ""Angels in America,"" of course, do not appear until the final scene of this 352-minute drama at the fountain in Central Park with the statue of the Bethesda angel. Those characters represent all faiths, races, genders, sexual orientations, and generations, as well as caregivers and patients, and reinforce the idea that heaven is what we make on earth. For those who need points made directly and explicitly, the play provides a benediction, delivered directly into the camera in close-up in language so plain and firm as to command their assent.""Angels in America"" is both beautiful and profane. The dialogue is witty and searing, poetic and powerful. The collision of characters is compelling, as are the performances. Several of the performers, most notably Streep, have multiple roles, which adds an additional level of resonance to the tale being told. You would think that after almost two decades this play would be dated, but while there is clearly a fierce anger against the Reagan America of that time, ultimately ""Angels in America"" is about compassion and understanding, even towards that which we hate. The great irony here may well be that the fear and hatred of the homosexual community against those who fear and hate them is just as strong. The difference is that the notion of ""community"" is decidedly more vital to gays and lesbians.Director Mike Nichols has shepherded Kushner's brilliant translation of his stage drama to the small screen and confirmed once again how good television can be (even when it is not TV but HBO). I really think that the only thing to compare this to in television history is ""Roots,"" and not simply because it is another example of how television can raise the consciousness of the nation. I say this because of the way this production has been chaining out, with more and more people checking out this monumental work, just as the audience for ""Roots"" built each night it was on. All those Emmy awards can only help spread the word.",5,"No wonder ""Angels in America"" won all those Emmy Awards",1095638400,"09 20, 2004",2004,5061,"['have', 'long', 'held', 'major', 'strength',

I didn't expect to like it.  I don't like stories that include angels, dream sequences and long philosophical speeches.  And the topic of AIDS in the 1980s was sure to be, I thought, depressing.  I therefore only rented the first of the two-disk series and expected to only watch the first of the three episodes it contained.  Three hours later, it was well past midnight and I was sorry I didn't have the second disk in my possession because I would have stayed up all night to watch it. It took another two days for me to get the second disk.  And now that I've watched the whole thing, I'm certainly impressed.First of all there is the star power.  All Pacino is cast as the true-life lawyer Roy Cohn who really did die of AIDS in the eighties.  He's one of those people we all love to hate, and hate him we do, right down to his painful death scene in which he dies angry and unrepentant. This is perhaps his finest role and he is absolutely fantastic.Then there is Meryl Streep.  She actually plays three different roles.  I recognized her in two of them - as the Mormon mother of a gay son who has left his wife, and as the historical Ethel Rosenberg who Roy Cohn sent to her death in the 1950s.  But it wasn't until the credits rolled until I realized she also was cast as the bearded rabbi who officiated at a funeral in the opening scene.  Emma Thompson played multiple roles too.  She's the understanding nurse as well as a homeless woman.  But in her largest part, she's an angel.  And, rest assured, she is no ordinary angel.  She's angry and gutsy and passionate and wild.  And even though I still don't like angel scenes and wished they would hurry up and end, I must admit that her acting was superb.Justin Kirk plays the young gay man with AIDS. His performance is spectacular as we watch him go through all the phases of contemplating his death.  His lover, Ben Shenkman, is weak.  And so he runs away, deserting his companion and trying to find solace by starting a relationship with Patrick Wilson, a married Mormon attorney whose ethics have been compromised by Roy Cohn.  Mary-Louise Parker is cast has Patrick Wilson's slightly insane wife.  Jeffrey Wright is an angel who helps her out and he's also cast as a gay nurse who takes care of Roy Cohn. His performance is fantastic and I must say he's an actor to take note of.There are six episodes in all.  And all are not created equal.  There are slow parts that bored me.  And, true to my own tastes, I didn't like the scenes with the angels.  But, taken as a whole, I was caught up in the artistry of the writer, director and actors.  I also loved theme even though it was disturbing.  It put me right back in the 1980s when the world was just discovering the awful specter of the AIDS crisis.

The first hour or so was interesting, the struggle of choosing which comes first--your family or your lover. Then it progressed to the conflict between homosexual segments of the Jewish culture and Mormon culture and Reagan White House culture--and every character began to speak in what became monologues--even though it was supposed to be dialogue. There were a lot of profound thoughts--but the writer seemed to be intent on making every line of ""dialogue"" a profound thought--and wasn't content to limit each character to a few profound thoughts at at time but had to string them all together in long lines of dialogue that morphed into monologue. Unfortunately, when one character rattles on for five minutes at a time, those profound thoughts begin to sound like the jabbering heard in a room full of drunks. By the time I got to the second disk I was sick of their proselytizing and decided this movie is one of the worst bunches of crap I've ever listened to.

I'll just take my chances, in the belief that the true perverts are those who cheer the legalizing of automatic guns and the denial of basic civil rights to whole segments of society, but are deeply offended at the sight of a naked human body. Not, for that matter, that there are more than 30 seconds of full nudity in the whole 6 hours of this miniseries. Let me just state flat-out that Angels in America is by far the best American made TV production I've ever seen, and no doubt one of the most meaningful, wise and healthy things to have come out of that country for a very long time! Why this show wasn't aired in Europe is beyond me.The original play was premiered in The Netherlands by RO Theater in Rotterdam in 1995, at which occasion I saw it and was completely blown away by it. I was very curious to see whether the intensity achieved in a small theatre through a very spare, minimalist production - very much ""actor-driven"", as Kushner suggests in his instructions - would hold up amidst the trappings of a big scale multimillion dollar TV-production. I remember how back then the closing scene of  Perestroika, where the characters address the audience directly, was almost unbearably intimate and had me stifling my tears. To my surprise the effect achieved in the filmed version is, if anything, even stronger. The whole experience of viewing this was so compelling that I would probably have watched it in its entirety in one go had it not been way beyond my bedtime...If you like simple escapist happy endings, are allergic to surrealism, have trouble confronting the ravages of serious illness, are deeply religious, are a homophobic or a hardcore republican, beware. If any of these apply then you REALLY need to watch this, but you won't like it! AinA certainly is no innocent family entertainment, as one of my fellow reviewers found out after being fooled by the romantic box cover. This is an angel that deals out orgasms and whose approach is signalled by erections! Tony Kushner's writing is up-front, uncompromising and irreverent in dealing with matters of emotion, sex, politics, religion and the general ugliness of the world. It is also deliberately stylized in places, but realism is never a first concern in a story where the dead mingle with the living, visions and hallucinations abound and angels descend from heaven. It's a tribute to Kushner's genius that no matter how surreal the context, the people in this story are nevertheless profoundly touching. They may be thwarted characters, but they aren't flat ones! I was glad to find that the whole production adheres very closely to the original text of the plays. It is a heady mix of razor-sharp (and at times hilarious) sarcasm, anguished tragedy, gay clich&eacute;, biblical allegory and political pamphlet. The outward appearance, a story centring on AIDS victims in  '80s New York, may seem dated, but the underlying message is universal. AinA addresses some fundamental questions about the nature of the USA that have rarely been more to-the-point than they are today (the quip about the word ""free"" in the national anthem being deliberately set to such a high note that nobody can reach it struck me as particularly topical...).To see these highly charged lines delivered by such a cast as this one is of course pure delight. Al Pacino trumps his own satanic performance in ""Devil's advocate"" as a thoroughly corrupt, yet strangely intriguing Roy Cohn. It's good to see Emma Thompson out of period costume and in angelic garb for a change, and to my non-american ears the twang she gives Nurse Emily sounds quite convincing; the power of the words is even such that they succeed in turning Meryl Streep into somebody else than Meryl Streep. But though these big names are the ones touted on the box, it are Justin Kirk, Ben Schenkman, Patrick Wilson and Mary-Louise Parker who act the true core of the story, and in no way does the power and passion of their performances yield to that of the ""stars"".Angels in America offers you a lot to think about and has a powerful potential to move. Some of its characters may seem hard to identify with, but soon enough you'll find that you have more in common with them than you thought (and like, possibly). On top of all that this series is beautifully produced. Rather than going all out on special effects, the supernatural events retain a theatrical feel. ""It's OK if the wires show"", Kushner says in his staging instructions; of course, there are no wires showing here, but scenes in Antarctica (stage set) or Heaven (Hadrian's villa in Tivoli, Italy, with the Golden Gate bridge blended into the background) have been realized through artistic creativity rather than the nowadays ubiquitous and bloodless computer tricks. It only adds to the sincerity of it all. Thomas Newman's music is, as always, a treat in itself.

Is the angel the nurse or is the nurse the angel?  (Those who have seen it understand that last question)Although this film is strikingly well done, it does give those who  have no knowledge of such things, a mistaken idea of God and heaven.  God is on holiday here and angels are trying to cope the best they can.  While one can appreciate the more ""real"" aspects of the film, the surreal images might be considered to be God bashing or Christian bashing as it were.  Those who know scripture would find such as was written in this story, laughable.  And indeed I did laugh at the attempts to describe what some would call the ""spiritual"" aspects of Angels in America.The dynamics of friendship, loyality, kindness, self hatred and caring for one another all come into play here and are woven together well.  Meryl Streep in her role of the Mormon took on a  sort of dumbness that I fear is all to common an opinion of those who try to live their lives according to their faith.Many deeper issues lie herein.  Morality, faith, heaven & hell, responsibility,  respect, where illnes comes from, why do we suffer, are angles real, is God real, does He hear our prayers, doesn't He care, where is He?  Obviously the answers to these and other queries you may have will not be answered in the watching of ""Angles"".  Still, it's a fine piece of work.I would recommend it to only those who are are not easily swayed.  The subject matter may offend some folks with certain sensibilities.  It can be graphic at times.  Even so, Angels in America is one of the most brilliant works from Mike Nichols to date.",4,Angels...not really but....,1095897600,"09 23, 2004",2004,2336,"['Let', 'cut', 'chase', 'here', 'Angels', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'gloriously', 'acted', 'fictional', 'work', 'Amazingly', 'was', 'lesser', 'known', 'actors', 'gave', 'most', 'brilliant', 'performances', 'Much', 'more', 'so', 'even', 'Pacino', 'Streep', 'roles', 'were', 'played', 'realism', 'vibrance', 'Truly', 'exceptional', 'work', 'acting', 'cinematography', 'was', 'enough', 'cause', 'sit', 'down', 'watch', 'miniseries', 'even', 'was', 'not', 'what', 'anticipated', 'Even', 'beginning', 'credits', 'are', 'lovely', 'as', 'well', 'music', 'Angels', 'well', 'written', 'what', 'closer', 'look', 'however', 'one', 'think', 'perhaps', 'people', 'are', 'suffering', 'AIDS', 'are', 'angels', 'are', 'angels', 'people', 'try', 'help', 'who', 'are', 'stricken', 'angel', 'nurse', 'nurse', 'angel', 'who', 'have', 'seen', 'understand', 'last', 'question', 'film', 'strikingly', 'well', 'done', 'give', 'who', 'have', 'knowledge', 'such', 'things', 'mistaken', 'idea', 'God', 'heaven', 'God', 'holiday', 'here', 'angels', 'are', 'trying', 'cope', 'best', 'can', 'one', 'can', 'appreciate', 'more', 'real', 'aspects', 'film', 'surreal', 'images', 'might', 'be', 'considered', 'be', 'God', 'bashing', 'Christian', 'bashing', 'were', 'who', 'know', 'scripture', 'would', 'find', 'such', 'was', 'written', 'story', 'laughable', 'indeed', 'did', 'laugh', 'attempts', 'describe', 'what', 'would', 'call', 'spiritual', 'aspects', 'Angels', 'America.The', 'dynamics', 'friendship', 'loyality', 'kindness', 'self', 'hatred', 'caring', 'one', 'come', 'play', 'here', 'are', 'woven', 'together', 'well', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'role', 'Mormon', 'took', 'sort', 'dumbness', 'fear', 'common', 'opinion', 'who', 'try', 'live', 'lives', 'according', 'faith.Many', 'deeper', 'issues', 'lie', 'herein', 'Morality', 'faith', 'heaven', 'hell', 'responsibility', 'respect', 'where', 'illnes', 'why', 'do', 'suffer', 'are', 'angles', 'real', 'God', 'real', 'hear', 'prayers', ""n't"", 'care', 'where', 'Obviously', 'answers', 'other', 'queries', 'may', 'have', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'answered', 'watching', 'Angles', 'Still', 'fine', 'piece', 'work.I', 'would', 'recommend', 'only', 'who', 'are', 'are', 'not', 'easily', 'swayed', 'subject', 'matter', 'may', 'offend', 'folks', 'certain', 'sensibilities', 'can', 'be', 'graphic', 'times', 'Even', 'so', 'Angels', 'America', 'one', 'most', 'brilliant', 'works', 'Mike', 'Nichols', 'date']",Angels in America

I was expecting part 2 to follow and was extremely disappointed to learn it wasn't showing. The next day I ran out and bought the DVD and sat for another 3 hours during part 2 transfixed.It has taken me 2 weeks to sit down and write this review, I just could not find the words to do it and still find it difficult to do now. I am not going to go into any detail about the plot or the incredible characters as one can read plenty of excellent reviews from excellent reviewers on these matters below..of which I am pleased to see 95% are good, and deservedly so. I merely want to say how it made me feel and that this film moved me in a way very few that have preceeded it have. This movie made me feel practically every human emotion there is...which is a little scary being that few films or plays can do such a thing. Is it tragic? yes, is it hopeful? yes, is it funny? yes, serious? yes, boring? never. Is it about gay men dying of AIDS? yes....but that is only on the surface, it is about SO much more than that.It is about people (gay and straight)and our not so sometimes perfect journey through life in this very uncertain and frequently ugly world. At the risk of sounding cliched or cheezy this movie has changed something in me, forever. It makes one want to be a better person, to not be fearful and angry at what we dont understand or hate, rather we should should strive to be compasionate and understanding...even of the things or people we might loathe.If you have adverse feelings towards discussions on religion, philosophy,politics,love,death,abandonment,self discovery,the American dream,disease,race,drugs,devotion,homosexuals, and INCREDIBLE dialogue that borders on Shakespearean you probably wont like this film, however, you should watch it! It may make you see something different..in a different light. Don't be biased, check that at the door and watch with an open, forward thinking mind.I am 28 years old and barely remember the outbreak of AIDS in the early 80's and I also barely remember the Reagan years. I am pretty well educated in politics and history though...but you want need to be....if you are human you will understand. My only regret is that I did not get to see this Tony and Pulitzer Prize winning Broadway sensation of the 90's on stage. If it is ever revived on Broadway I will pay what ever the cost to see it.There are Angels in America, the angels are us.Bravo HBO...incredible!",5,Utterly....Superb,1110326400,"03 9, 2005",2005,2744,"['sat', 'down', 'one', 'Saturday', 'evening', '2', 'hours', 'was', 'go', 'out', 'town', 'enjoy', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'incredible', 'dining', 'nightlife', 'began', 'watching', 'Angels', 'America', 'part', '1', 'HBO', '..I', 'sat', 'transfixed', 'still', '3', 'hours', 'cancelled', 'plans', 'go', 'out', '1', '1/2', 'hours', 'ended', 'COULD', 'NOT', 'PULL', 'MYSELF', 'AWAY', 'was', 'expecting', 'part', '2', 'follow', 'was', 'extremely', 'disappointed', 'learn', 'was', ""n't"", 'showing', 'next', 'day', 'ran', 'out', 'bought', 'DVD', 'sat', '3', 'hours', 'part', '2', 'transfixed.It', 'taken', '2', 'weeks', 'sit', 'down', 'write', 'review', 'just', 'could', 'not', 'find', 'words', 'do', 'still', 'find', 'difficult', 'do', 'now', 'am', 'not', 'going', 'go', 'detail', 'plot', 'incredible', 'characters', 'one', 'can', 'read', 'plenty', 'excellent', 'reviews', 'excellent', 'reviewers', 'matters', 'below..of', 'am', 'pleased', 'see', '95', '%', 'are', 'good', 'deservedly', 'so', 'merely', 'want', 'say', 'how', 'made', 'feel', 'film', 'moved', 'way', 'very', 'few', 'have', 'preceeded', 'have', 'movie', 'made', 'feel', 'practically', 'human', 'emotion', 'little', 'scary', 'being', 'few', 'films', 'plays', 'can', 'do', 'thing', 'tragic', 'yes', 'hopeful', 'yes', 'funny', 'yes', 'serious', 'yes', 'boring', 'never', 'gay', 'men', 'dying', 'AIDS', 'yes', '.but', 'only', 'surface', 'SO', 'much', 'more', 'that.It', 'people', 'gay', 'straight', 'not', 'so', 'sometimes', 'perfect', 'journey', 'life', 'very', 'uncertain', 'frequently', 'ugly', 'world', 'risk', 'sounding', 'cliched', 'cheezy', 'movie', 'changed', 'something', 'forever', 'one', 'want', 'be', 'better', 'person', 'not', 'be', 'fearful', 'angry', 'what', 'dont', 'understand', 'hate', 'rather', 'should', 'should', 'strive', 'be', 'compasionate', 'understanding', 'even', 'things', 'people', 'might', 'loathe.If', 'have', 'adverse', 'feelings', 'towards', 'discussions', 'religion', 'philosophy', 'politics', 'love', 'death', 'abandonment', 'discovery', 'American', 'dream', 'disease', 'race', 'drugs', 'devotion', 'homosexuals', 'INCREDIBLE', 'dialogue', 'borders', 'Shakespearean', 'probably', 'wont', 'film', 'however', 'should', 'watch', 'may', 'make', 'see', 'something', 'different..in', 'different', 'light', 'Do', ""n't"", 'be', 'biased', 'check', 'door', 'watch', 'open', 'forward', 'thinking', 'mind.I', 'am', '28', 'years', 'old', 'barely', 'remember', 'outbreak', 'AIDS', 'early', '80', 'also', 'barely', 'remember', 'Reagan', 'years', 'am', 'pretty', 'well', 'educated', 'politics', 'history', 'want', 'need', 'be', 'are', 'human', 'will', 'understand', 'only', 'regret', 'did', 'not', 'get', 'see', 'Tony', 'Pulitzer', 'Prize', 'winning', 'Broadway', 'sensation', '90', 'stage', 'ever', 'revived', 'Broadway', 'will', 'pay', 'what', 'ever', 'cost', 'see', 'it.There', 'are', 'Angels', 'America', 'angels', 'are', 'us.Bravo', 'HBO', 'incredible']",Angels in America

The story was also complex with complex characters and overall was well done.However, it is obvious that the writer had created a story he wanted to share but didn't have an ending.  The angel and heaven scenes near the end were horrendously hokey.  Some characters at the end stepped out of character to give little speeches that seemed very corny especially out of place against the superb acting that was displayed through the rest of the movie.There wasn't as much liberal preachiness as other are complaining there is.  Not that there isn't liberal venom sprinkled throughout the movie. It just doesn't dominate as others claim.

806047,A3106VD94ULBKZ,B0001I2BUI,"Nathan Bauer ""Movie Man""","[2, 8]","Just rented the movie this weekend and was glad that I found the movie.  Yes people who have reviewed it this is about the gay lifestyle but it takes it about 2 steps further and it tells the story of three gay people.  One about Roy Cohn the famous attourney who committed two people to death and then he and his gay lover are documented in this movie and he ends up having Aids and ends up in the hospital dying of this very death and in the end the friend of the lawyer that Roy has working for comes in and says a Jewish Prayer over the dead body of Roy.  Second there is a story of a man named Prior Walter and this man also is a gay person but ends up getting AIDS also and ends up living for six years after he gets the disease and during the first few months of this disease he sees this angel and ends up in the end going up to heaven to beg of forgiveness to the higher authority and comes back down to earth and preaches the word to everyone and takes the bible the angel gives to him.  The third story in this miniseries is about a man named Joe and his wife and his wife ends up taking some Valium everyday of her life and ends up hallucinating everyday and going into dreams and also in the end of the first disk she ends up in her makeshift dream of Antartica which in my estimation is very weird and very cooky but in the end Joe is a closet lesbian and comes out to his wife and her mother played by Meryl Streep and he ends up dating Prior Walters boyfriend but in the end they break up and Priors boyfriend comes back to him.  At the end of the miniseries we see Prior, his boyfriend, Joe's mother, and Roy Cohn's nurse in the middle of Manhatten in front of a statue and Prior is giving us a monologue of the rest of his life six years after getting diagnosed with Aids.  To me this was a riviting miniseries and a very eye opening one for me because I should not be judging people by who they go out with for what reasons everyone has their choice in who they go out with and we can be thankful for that.  That is why this miniseries was nominated for 21 emmy awards and won half of them 11 including Best Actress in a Miniseries and Best Supporting Actress in a Miniseries plus the Best Miniseries.  So all in all very well done by Tony Kushner and Mike Nichols for adapting it to the small screen.",5,Really Good Miniseries,1096243200,"09 27, 2004",2004,2320,"['Just', 'rented', 'movie', 'weekend', 'was', 'glad', 'found', 'movie', 'Yes', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'reviewed', 'gay', 'lifestyle', '2', 'steps', 'further', 'story', 'three', 'gay', 'people', 'One', 'Roy', 'Cohn', 'famous', 'attourney', 'who', 'committed', 'two', 'people', 'death', 'then', 'gay', 'lover', 'are', 'documented', 'movie', 'up', 'having', 'Aids', 'up', 'hospital', 'dying', 'very', 'death', 'end', 'friend', 'lawyer', 'Roy', 'working', 'Jewish', 'Prayer', 'dead', 'body', 'Roy', 'Second', 'story', 'man', 'named', 'Prior', 'Walter', 'man', 'also', 'gay', 'person', 'up', 'getting', 'AIDS', 'also', 'up', 'living', 'six', 'years', 'disease', 'first', 'few', 'months', 'disease', 'angel', 'up', 'end', 'going', 'up', 'heaven', 'beg', 'forgiveness', 'higher', 'authority', 'back', 'down', 'earth', 'word', 'everyone', 'bible', 'angel', 'third', 'story', 'miniseries', 'man', 'named', 'Joe', 'wife', 'wife', 'up', 'taking', 'Valium', 'everyday', 'life', 'up', 'hallucinating', 'everyday', 'going', 'dreams', 'also', 'end', 'first', 'disk', 'up', 'makeshift', 'dream', 'Antartica', 'estimation', 'very', 'weird', 'very', 'cooky', 'end', 'Joe', 'closet', 'lesbian', 'out', 'wife', 'mother', 'played', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'up', 'dating', 'Prior', 'Walters', 'boyfriend', 'end', 'break', 'up', 'Priors', 'boyfriend', 'back', 'end', 'miniseries', 'see', 'Prior', 'boyfriend', 'Joe', 'mother', 'Roy', 'Cohn', 'nurse', 'middle', 'Manhatten', 'front', 'statue', 'Prior', 'giving', 'monologue', 'rest', 'life', 'six', 'years', 'getting', 'diagnosed', 'Aids', 'was', 'riviting', 'miniseries', 'very', 'eye', 'opening', 'one', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'judging', 'people', 'who', 'go', 'out', 'what', 'reasons', 'everyone', 'choice', 'who', 'go', 'out', 'can', 'be', 'thankful', 'why', 'miniseries', 'was', 'nominated', '21', 'emmy', 'awards', 'won', 'half', '11', 'including', 'Best', 'Actress', 'Miniseries', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actress', 'Miniseries', 'Best', 'Miniseries', 'So', 'all', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'Tony', 'Kushner', 'Mike', 'Nichols', 'adapting', 'small', 'screen']",Angels in America

If they are ""genuine"", and not just ranting for the sake of it, I begin to wonder where these people come from, what their cultural location is. One of the eventualities of living in an age that is so besotted with the internet, with ""open forums"", is that now everyone can have their say, every social or political rant can ""be heard"", so to speak. The internet and some of the exclamatory fragments that become available through its medium (even at shopping sites like Amazon!?!) can become an interesting barometer of conservative hysteria and reaction. The review below mine was clearly written by someone articulate. Its content is, however, alarming and deluded. Tony Kushner is a ""socialist"" and ""Angels in America"" is couched in ""Communist"" rhetoric? Kushner is against American ""free society"", ""freedom of choice"" and ""liberalism"", is dangerously opposed to the ""American dream"" (etc.,etc.)?What I always find interesting about rants like this is that words such as ""Free Society"", ""Patriotism"", ""Democracy"" (etc.) are always taken to be transparent, un-problematic terms in an immutable binary opposition, posited as ""right"" and ""normal"", with the other terms (""Communism"", ""Socialism"", the ""Left"") are ""abnormal"", ""wrong"" and deviant. ""Angels in America"" deals precisely with the [O]ther term in the opposition: ""homosexual"", ""AIDS"", ""Black"", ""Jew"", ""leftism"" (not analogous to ""Communism"" by the way) in the face of the monolithic American conservatism of the 1980's that would ignore it. The reviewer below would crush Kushner's voice for being ""anti-patriotic"", hence ""anti-American"" while the film itself deals precisely with marginal communities that will not and CANNOT be recuperated into the kind of America that the reviewer un-problematically seems to posit as the ""Real America"". This image of America does not really have ""free will"" as its basis, as the reviewer would have us believe (via Walt Whitman!), but rather ""conformity"". I think people like this reviewer are so reductive, conservative, ""silencing"" and uncompromisingly ""faithful"" in their thinking that they are the dangerous ones, not Kushner and his justly oppositional voice. Although the terms in the opposition have changed (somewhat) since the 1980's - to get into it would require more space than is available here -  the terrifying conservatism of the 80's is still with us.

I heard a girl in a theater class say ""I'm avoiding HBO's version of the play.""  I'm 23, and she's probably younger that I, so I doubt that she actually saw the broadway production(but you never know).However, do you have this attitude, first of all, this is the only thing out there that you can watch, so if your boycotting in favor of the original, you've got nothing to watch.  Plus, Tony Kushner is behind it, do you think that he would actually let his work of art be destroyed?  And he didn't let it.  The casting is great, and you get all those great things that you can't get on stage in this DVD, and the music is amazing.  I bought the CD for the title piece alone.  My favorite scene is when Harper and Prior share a dream/hallucination.Anyways, don't boycott this version in favor of the original play.

806050,A2VK365XEVCYC8,B0001I2BUI,One More Option,"[1, 2]","One of the several angels in this film says, ""You ain't stupid. So don't ask stupid. Ask something for real."" She is saying that most people avoid complex truths in life, and instead they choose to cycle their brains in cursory pursuits. She encourages Harper to ask tougher, more real questions. And Harper complies by asking, ""In your experience of the world, how do people change?"" THAT is a tough question to answer. How do you get people to change any of their long ingrained patterns? THAT is an incredibly complex, intelligent, and real question.Love finds ways to create bonds between the people in this film who start out perceiving they are adversaries. In this movie, angels, both heavenly and mortal, watch over and gaurd. They enlighten.The movie asks: Should personal truths be expressed? No matter how horrible or sinful a person feels about them, does expressing them create less long term fear and harm than either silence or lies? Harper wants to know what her gay husband is doing while he is away from her. So she asks, ""Can I come with you? This isn't working anymore, I'm cold."" He says, ""I wouldn't want you to see."" She replies, ""You think it's worse than what I imagine? It's not."" It's not necessarily the fact that Harper's husband is gay that ends their relationship. It appears more likely that it is his dishonesty with Harper about his homosexuality, coupled with his denial and self-punishment within himself, and his inability to conceive how his feelings for both men and his wife can be reconciled well - that all combine to create the rifts between them. Yet Harper personally and truly loves him, despite all of that. I still believe that when she says her love for him is irreducibly real, she is being totally honest with herself and the audience.Truth is messy. Truth is sometimes ""sin"" full. Truth is more complex than most people understand. The lead character concedes, ""I usually say f*#@ the truth, but usually the truth f#@*s you."" Personal truths don't often fit commonly promoted 'truths'. Regulary, personal truths are more complex than & contradictory with the status quo. And a person can say, ""F*#@ It!,"" but that is just giving up. It is an unintelligent conclusion because it allows the status quo to universally trump personal truths. And the status quo should not be allowed to do that to beautiful and uncommon individuals.To quote Billy Joel, ""You can say the human heart is only make belief, but that is only fighting fire with fire."" That quote for me has always meant: You can deny your feelings. You can say that your 'Emotions are just getting the best of you,' but that suggests there is no personal truth creating your personal emotions. And I've usually found that emotions are not just stupid chemical responses; rather, there are usually great, natural reasons why emotions effect us so strongly. And if a person incorrectly labels those emotions as selfish or fallen, they may be misidentifying their body's good natural responses, responses that are trying to fight to build and create loving relationships, even if those relationships are not in line with the status quo.The movie encourages NOT being silent. The leading gay protanonist, in his final great speech, having survived living with AIDS for several years, says of homosexuals and outcasts in general, ""We will not die silent deaths anymore."" Change cannot come without discussion. And the forces that don't want change will call for silence because discussing real, complex moral ideas can change the world.",4,"""Ask something for real""",1144886400,"04 13, 2006",2006,3540,"['One', 'several', 'angels', 'film', 'ai', ""n't"", 'stupid', 'So', 'do', ""n't"", 'ask', 'stupid', 'Ask', 'something', 'real', 'saying', 'most', 'people', 'avoid', 'complex', 'truths', 'life', 'instead', 'choose', 'cycle', 'brains', 'cursory', 'pursuits', 'Harper', 'ask', 'tougher', 'more', 'real', 'questions', 'Harper', 'complies', 'asking', 'experience', 'world', 'how', 'do', 'people', 'change', 'THAT', 'tough', 'question', 'answer', 'How', 'do', 'get', 'people', 'change', 'long', 'ingrained', 'patterns', 'THAT', 'incredibly', 'complex', 'intelligent', 'real', 'question.Love', 'finds', 'ways', 'create', 'bonds', 'people', 'film', 'who', 'start', 'out', 'perceiving', 'are', 'adversaries', 'movie', 'angels', 'heavenly', 'mortal', 'watch', 'gaurd', 'enlighten.The', 'movie', 'asks', 'Should', 'personal', 'truths', 'be', 'expressed', 'matter', 'how', 'horrible', 'sinful', 'person', 'feels', 'expressing', 'create', 'less', 'long', 'term', 'fear', 'harm', 'silence', 'lies', 'Harper', 'know', 'what', 'gay', 'husband', 'doing', 'away', 'Can', 'come', ""n't"", 'working', 'anymore', ""'m"", 'cold', 'would', ""n't"", 'want', 'see', 'think', 'worse', 'what', 'imagine', 'not', 'not', 'necessarily', 'fact', 'Harper', 'husband', 'gay', 'relationship', 'more', 'likely', 'dishonesty', 'Harper', 'homosexuality', 'coupled', 'denial', 'self-punishment', 'inability', 'conceive', 'how', 'feelings', 'men', 'wife', 'can', 'be', 'reconciled', 'well', 'combine', 'create', 'rifts', 'Harper', 'personally', 'truly', 'still', 'believe', 'when', 'love', 'irreducibly', 'real', 'being', 'totally', 'honest', 'herself', 'audience.Truth', 'messy', 'Truth', 'sometimes', 'sin', 'full', 'Truth', 'more', 'complex', 'most', 'people', 'understand', 'lead', 'character', 'concedes', 'usually', 'say', 'f*', 'truth', 'usually', 'truth', 'f', '@', '*s', 'Personal', 'truths', 'do', ""n't"", 'often', 'fit', 'commonly', 'promoted', ""'truths"", 'Regulary', 'personal', 'truths', 'are', 'more', 'complex', 'contradictory', 'status', 'quo', 'person', 'can', 'say', 'F*', 'just', 'giving', 'up', 'unintelligent', 'conclusion', 'status', 'quo', 'universally', 'trump', 'personal', 'truths', 'status', 'quo', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'allowed', 'do', 'beautiful', 'uncommon', 'individuals.To', 'quote', 'Billy', 'Joel', 'can', 'say', 'human', 'heart', 'only', 'make', 'belief', 'only', 'fighting', 'fire', 'fire', 'quote', 'always', 'meant', 'can', 'deny', 'feelings', 'can', 'say', ""'Emotions"", 'are', 'just', 'getting', 'best', 'personal', 'truth', 'creating', 'personal', 'emotions', ""'ve"", 'usually', 'found', 'emotions', 'are', 'not', 'just', 'stupid', 'chemical', 'responses', 'rather', 'are', 'usually', 'great', 'natural', 'reasons', 'why', 'emotions', 'effect', 'so', 'strongly', 'person', 'incorrectly', 'emotions', 'selfish', 'fallen', 'may', 'be', 'misidentifying', 'body', 'good', 'natural', 'responses', 'responses', 'are', 'trying', 'fight', 'build', 'create', 'loving', 'relationships', 'even', 'relationships', 'are', 'not', 'line', 'status', 'quo.The', 'movie', 'NOT', 'being', 'silent', 'leading', 'gay', 'protanonist', 'final', 'great', 'speech', 'having', 'survived', 'living', 'AIDS', 'several', 'years', 'homosexuals', 'outcasts', 'general', 'will', 'not', 'die', 'silent', 'deaths', 'anymore', 'Change', 'can', 'not', 'come', 'discussion', 'forces', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'change', 'will', 'call', 'silence', 'discussing', 'real', 'complex', 'moral', 'ideas', 'can', 'change', 'world']",Angels in America

806054,A1PL8JA0TEHBVN,B0001I2BUI,Paulo Leite,"[4, 9]","It was with a lot of anticipation that watched ANGELS IN AMERICA - the adaptation of a Pulitzer Prize winning play about the HIV outbreak during the Reagan years.Lots of people here have criticized this 6-hour HBO huge production for political reasons... or because they disagree with some of the views axpressed... or because it supposedly glorifies this or that... or because Ethel Rosemberg is portraited in a certain way... etc.But ANGELS IN AMERICA disappointed me simply because of its weaknesses as a film.FIRST - It is a 6-hour film that has no material to be 6 hours long. At best, it could have been 3 hours long. I have nothing about long films when ""long"" is a consequence of a real dramatic necessity. Here it looks like the producers decided to stretch the screenplay in order to make it look more epic or more overwhelming, or more important, or something it clearly is not. MAYBE it was just a way of justifying the big budget.SECOND - The scenes are clearly overlong with lots and lots of excessive dialog. The dialog is sometimes beautiful, powerful and poetic... but lost in the excess of talking heads.THIRD - The ending itself lasts over 30 minutes. It looks like the thirdLORD OF THE RINGS: it takes forever to end!!FOURTH - While Al Pacino (the lawyer who dies of AIDS), Jeffrey Wright (unforgettable as Belize, the gay black nurse) and Justin Kirk (as the AIDS victim who is abandoned by his boyfriend) all give beautiful performances, I must say that the other characters look like cardboard stereotypes.And they are stereotypes because the author clearly hates them: A Mormon (Patrick Wilson) who discover he is gay, his wife (Mary-Louise Parker who looks likeWILL & GRACE's Karen Walker on Valium), his Mormon mother (Meryl Streep) who does not understand her son, and Louis Ironson (Ben Shenkman), the selfish liberal Reagan-hater.With six hours of film, one would expect all these character would have a lot more substance... but only some of them really are that developed. Take the mother (Meryl Streep), for example: she is a Mormon who arrives in NYC after discovering her son is gay. She is clearly someone with lots of prejudices and hate. And yet... we hardly see her having to cope with reality. We hardly the character's arch. Suddenly, she helps Walter Prior (Justin Kirk) to get to the hospital, stays with him, sees the angel, gets frightened and leaves the next morning saying she had a strange dream... and suddenly she is the most gay-friendly person in the world. And not a hint on how her relationship with her own son (the Mormon gay guy) has changed.FIFTH - Somebody please explain to me WHY, on the very first scene, do we see Meryl Streep as an 80-year old Rabi? The make-up is great... but her voice OBVIOUSLY sounds like a woman pretending to be an old man!! Why? Several characters are played by the same actor.

I was epecially annoyed that one reviewer mentioned that it was ""dated""; this can only be attributed to the brilliant Mike Nichols creating a period piece (the '80's). The immense amount of subtle humor certainly alleviated the grotesque allegory that was taking place. Without that element, this would've been downer-city. Example, Prior (Justin Kirk) wrestles with the Angel (Emma Thompson), and when it's over, the angel announces that she pulled a muscle and needs a break. Also, my favorite, Joe's Mormon mother (Meryl Streep) asks Prior if he's a hairdresser. He responds, saying that if he was, it'd be her luckiest day. Even the evil Roy Cohn (Pacino) makes jest of his plight. And then there's Streep as the cynical rabbi. I was very amused and entertained. My point is, that if you think this is a downer about HIV/AIDS, it covers much more than that. Motivations are explored, as in the relationship of Prior and Louis (Ben Shenkman); as well as the Mormon couple, Joe (Patrick Wilson) and Harper (Mary-Louise Parker). As far as the complaints I'd read about the dialogue, I thought every line of delivery by all of the above-mentioned was real and sincere...Emma's, however, was written to be interpreted by Prior, the ultimate drama queen, as he saw it. ""Angels in America"", as presented on HBO and directed by Nichols, is breathtakingly powerful. At 6 hours, it never fails to entertain. I'd had the DVD since March, when it was first released. I only watched it the other day, waiting for the right time to absorb the whole thing. And, yes, now I must watch it again (as a previous reviewer recommended).  This was nominated for practically every Golden Globe, Emmy, etc., that was available. The many fine male performances I'm sure caused confusion (leading/supporting?). I was impressed with Pacino, Streep and the wonderful Jeffrey Wright (as another sort of Angel), and EVERYONE involved, but in the long run, I was most impressed with Justin Kirk as Prior. He had the toughest part, and was seamless in his portrayal, so very  diverse. This is monumental in its achievement, and I wish everyone could see it to get a feeling of the attitudes at the beginning of the AIDS crisis. One nice thing about the film/play, is that, with the exception of Roy Cohn, everyone is a nice person at heart.My complaint about the DVD, especially at the price, is that there are absolutely NO extras. Commentary from any of the brilliant talents involved would be welcome, as well as a chapter-selection that allowed getting into and out of each of the 6 chapters. Even a making-of extra would be nice.

Frankly, it doesn't take watching the award show to see why it got so much notice this year, and I'd rather watch the series itself than the Emmy Award show any day of the week.""Angels in America"" is by turns funny, touching, whimsical, serious, and most of all surprising. I wasn't too surprised to learn that it was adapted from a stage play, as it has the feeling of a play at several key points in the story, but it's not distracting or annoying, and even adds to the effect in some ways.""Angels in America"" is essentially the story of several people of different backgrounds in New York City in 1986. This is the time of Ronald Reagan, the advent of AIDS, and a time of great uncertainty for many people in America. The characters of ""Angels"" are several gay men, a Mormon husband and wife, a mother, an angel, a ghost or two, and perhaps most surprisingly, McCarthy-era lawyer Roy Cohn. How these people's lives touch one another, how they weave together to form the tapestry of America, is the real theme of ""Angels in America.""The performances in ""Angels"" are all memorable, especially when you keep in mind that several of the actors play multiple roles (again, as often happens in a stage performance). See if you can spot Meryl Streep's first appearance in the film when you watch ""Angels"" for the first time! While all the actors were excellent, the performances that really stood out for me were Justin Kirk, Ben Shenkman, Emma Thompson (always a favorite of mine), and Al Pacino, who plays Roy Cohn in perhaps the best performance of his career. It takes top-notch performances to convey this sort of material convincingly, and these actors deliver all that and more.The direction of ""Angels"" was refreshing as well, at times lighthearted and at times deadly serious. Mike Nichols gets the point across in each scene with a steady hand, and despite some pretty tricky scenes never falters. The film is brutally honest in what it depicts when honesty is needed, but also whimsical at times when trying to be too serious would come off as outright cheese. I found the scenes with Emma Thompson as the messenger angel especially effective in this regard, as just when it seems like it's getting too over-the-top serious something surprisingly light happens. It's a combination used throughout the film, and always to good effect.The score for ""Angels in America"" deserves mention as well, especially as it was the score that originally brought the series to my attention. I'm a pretty stalwart devotee of Thomas Newman's work these days, and couldn't be more pleased with his music for ""Angels."" It's the perfect accompaniment for the series itself, and like the series the music rides the fine line between heartbreak and hope quite well. The music is lovely to listen to on its own as well, but more importantly, I can't really imagine any other composer's work who would match the emotions and themes of the series as well.Make no mistake, ""Angels in America"" is a complex work, much moreso than my simple summary of it would seem. No matter where you come from or what your background is, you are likely to find something in this series which challenges something you believe in -- not in an in your face sort of way, but in a subtle, nuanced way. This is not a presentation which is trying to offend you or change your mind, but it is certainly trying to make you think.Check your pre-conceived notions of religion, politics, sexuality, and even sanity at the door. In this vision of America, you'll find that they simply don't apply.

806061,A2VLF9FE68LFX6,B0001I2BUI,R. L. Hodges,"[16, 97]","There have been few movies that deserve the ratings this movie deserves.  Never before have I seen such exquisite hatred from Hollywood that covers all the bases like this movie does.  Conservatives, Religion, Republicans - all slammed effectively in one single movie that serves only one single purpose - to deceive.  It is pure genius how Republicans are singled out and actually blamed for the AIDS epidemic, despite how Republicans have never promoted homosexuality and drug use - the very means by which AIDS initially spread like wildfire during the 80s and early 90s (a fact we all remember very well).  This movie is truly worthy of the Michael Moore stamp of approval in first rate propaganda and disregard for anything sacred.  It is also a brilliant example of perfectly deceptive packaging - just look at that cover!  It will surely fool unsuspecting right-wing families into buying/renting it because it masks itself as some kind of Mel Gibson or Walt Disney movie, complete with zero description on the back of the cover as to what this movie actually contains (a brilliant plan to convert those right-wingers to liberalsim by tricking them).  It also does a fantastic job of getting Mormonism completely wrong (Mormons, remember, faithfully refuse to abandon Leviticus 18:22, a COMMANDMENT that AIDS seems to magnify).  About every concievable innacuracy one could conjure up about a religion is present in this movie while promoting a lifestyle that, if all practiced it, would doom the entire human race to extinction in a single generation due to lack of reproduction.  A new low that should earn Hollywood the notoriety they so desire and certainly earn in spades with this triumph of cinematic flatulence.  The utter degenerate state of humanity that this movie portrays truly serves the liberal agenda.  But it also serves the conservative agenda even more, doggone it.  For you see, as Hollywood continues it's downward spiral into the toilet, offending nearly everyone under the sun in the process, conservatives eagerly anticipate the next series of elections in which the Democrats (the political arm of Hollywood) will only continue to lose elections and scratch their heads as they wonder why.  As the rest of the growing majority of Americans who continue to sit back in their increasingly populous red states, read their bibles, raise their children to know the difference between right and wrong, vote against those who promote this tripe, and watch the liberals reap what they have sown, we have to ensure that Hollywood continues to crank out this kind of entertainment so that our message continues to get out loud and clear.Keep it coming, Hollywierd!",5,Perfectly Depraved and Devoid of Fact,1104710400,"01 3, 2005",2005,2685,"['have', 'been', 'few', 'movies', 'deserve', 'ratings', 'movie', 'Never', 'have', 'seen', 'such', 'exquisite', 'hatred', 'Hollywood', 'bases', 'movie', 'Conservatives', 'Religion', 'Republicans', 'slammed', 'effectively', 'one', 'single', 'movie', 'only', 'one', 'single', 'purpose', 'deceive', 'pure', 'genius', 'how', 'Republicans', 'are', 'singled', 'out', 'actually', 'blamed', 'AIDS', 'epidemic', 'how', 'Republicans', 'have', 'never', 'promoted', 'homosexuality', 'drug', 'use', 'very', 'AIDS', 'initially', 'spread', 'wildfire', '80s', 'early', '90s', 'fact', 'remember', 'very', 'well', 'movie', 'truly', 'worthy', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'stamp', 'approval', 'first', 'rate', 'propaganda', 'disregard', 'anything', 'sacred', 'also', 'brilliant', 'example', 'perfectly', 'deceptive', 'packaging', 'just', 'look', 'cover', 'will', 'surely', 'fool', 'unsuspecting', 'right-wing', 'families', 'buying/renting', 'kind', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'movie', 'complete', 'zero', 'description', 'back', 'cover', 'what', 'movie', 'actually', 'brilliant', 'plan', 'convert', 'right-wingers', 'liberalsim', 'tricking', 'also', 'fantastic', 'job', 'getting', 'Mormonism', 'completely', 'wrong', 'Mormons', 'remember', 'faithfully', 'refuse', 'abandon', 'Leviticus', '18:22', 'COMMANDMENT', 'AIDS', 'magnify', 'concievable', 'innacuracy', 'one', 'could', 'conjure', 'up', 'religion', 'present', 'movie', 'promoting', 'lifestyle', 'practiced', 'would', 'doom', 'entire', 'human', 'race', 'extinction', 'single', 'generation', 'due', 'lack', 'reproduction', 'new', 'low', 'should', 'earn', 'Hollywood', 'notoriety', 'so', 'desire', 'certainly', 'earn', 'spades', 'triumph', 'cinematic', 'flatulence', 'utter', 'degenerate', 'state', 'humanity', 'movie', 'truly', 'liberal', 'agenda', 'also', 'conservative', 'agenda', 'even', 'more', 'doggone', 'see', 'Hollywood', 'downward', 'spiral', 'toilet', 'offending', 'nearly', 'everyone', 'sun', 'process', 'eagerly', 'anticipate', 'next', 'series', 'elections', 'Democrats', 'political', 'arm', 'Hollywood', 'will', 'only', 'continue', 'lose', 'elections', 'scratch', 'heads', 'wonder', 'why', 'rest', 'growing', 'majority', 'Americans', 'who', 'continue', 'sit', 'back', 'increasingly', 'populous', 'red', 'states', 'read', 'bibles', 'raise', 'children', 'know', 'difference', 'right', 'wrong', 'vote', 'who', 'promote', 'tripe', 'watch', 'liberals', 'reap', 'what', 'have', 'sown', 'have', 'ensure', 'Hollywood', 'crank', 'out', 'kind', 'entertainment', 'message', 'get', 'out', 'loud', 'clear.Keep', 'coming', 'Hollywierd']",Angels in America

Ironically, no studio would ever release this theatrically. Too long. Too smart. Nothing that would make it's money back...even w/the talented folks in it.Religion, sexuality, disease, environment are all touched on - and not so lightly. Tony Kushner's play tells a great interwoven story - but I see some reviewers here must have forgotten (or been uninformed of) the '80s and the culture that was predominant during the Reagan era.The cast pulls it off flawlessly...almost.  Streep is does a wonderful job as Mother Pitt, but especially as Ethel Rosenberg (the make-up to look like Rosenberg is dead-on). For me, Al Pacino was, well, Al Pacino.  I know Roy Cohn is supposed to be over the top, but for much of his performance, Pacino plays it the way he's played many of his characters of the last decade.As for other actors (who are not supporting, but as much of leads characters as the ones played by Streep & Pacino) they are wonderful.  You cannot truly separate the men into whom is better than the next.  Ben Shenkman, Patrick Wilson, Justin Kirk and Jeffrey Wright do outstanding jobs.  (Though personally, I think Wilson does an A+ job as the sexually conflicted Republican.)I cannot say enough good things about the job Mary-Louise Parker does. I found her simply amazing. In a much more limited roles(s),Emma Thompson does a good job as the angel and a homeless woman....and an ok job as a nurse.Even tertiary characters do an excellent job - including Simon Callow as one of Prior Walter's ancestors.The story, though maybe exaggerated at points, delves into deep emotional waters.  The fear of disease, being sick, dying and the emotions that go with it are real....and at times unsettling (at least for me).  The loss of love on almost every character angle is just as hard.  There are no neat tied-up bows at the end...not really.Yes, the DVD has no extras - which is disappointing.  But a bigger disappointment would have been if the play had been adapted in a half-ass manner.  I can live w/out the extras.",5,Best Movie of the Year,1095465600,"09 18, 2004",2004,2122,"['Had', 'been', 'released', 'theatrically', 'think', ""'Angels"", 'America', 'would', 'be', 'best', 'movie', 'year', 'Ironically', 'studio', 'would', 'ever', 'release', 'theatrically', 'Too', 'long', 'Too', 'smart', 'Nothing', 'would', 'make', 'money', 'back', 'even', 'w/the', 'talented', 'folks', 'it.Religion', 'sexuality', 'disease', 'environment', 'are', 'touched', 'not', 'so', 'lightly', 'Tony', 'Kushner', 'play', 'great', 'interwoven', 'story', 'see', 'reviewers', 'here', 'must', 'have', 'forgotten', 'been', 'uninformed', ""'80s"", 'culture', 'was', 'predominant', 'Reagan', 'era.The', 'cast', 'pulls', 'off', 'flawlessly', 'almost', 'Streep', 'wonderful', 'job', 'Mother', 'Pitt', 'especially', 'Ethel', 'Rosenberg', 'make-up', 'look', 'Rosenberg', 'dead-on', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'was', 'well', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'know', 'Roy', 'Cohn', 'supposed', 'be', 'top', 'much', 'performance', 'Pacino', 'way', 'played', 'many', 'characters', 'last', 'decade.As', 'other', 'actors', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'supporting', 'as', 'much', 'leads', 'characters', 'ones', 'played', 'Streep', 'Pacino', 'are', 'wonderful', 'can', 'not', 'truly', 'separate', 'men', 'whom', 'better', 'next', 'Ben', 'Shenkman', 'Patrick', 'Wilson', 'Justin', 'Kirk', 'Jeffrey', 'Wright', 'do', 'outstanding', 'jobs', 'personally', 'think', 'Wilson', 'A+', 'job', 'sexually', 'conflicted', 'Republican', 'can', 'not', 'say', 'enough', 'good', 'things', 'job', 'Mary-Louise', 'Parker', 'found', 'simply', 'amazing', 'much', 'more', 'limited', 'roles', 's', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'good', 'job', 'angel', 'homeless', 'woman', '.and', 'ok', 'job', 'nurse.Even', 'tertiary', 'characters', 'do', 'excellent', 'job', 'including', 'Simon', 'Callow', 'one', 'Prior', 'Walter', 'ancestors.The', 'story', 'maybe', 'exaggerated', 'points', 'deep', 'emotional', 'waters', 'fear', 'disease', 'being', 'sick', 'dying', 'emotions', 'go', 'are', 'real', '.and', 'times', 'unsettling', 'least', 'loss', 'love', 'almost', 'character', 'angle', 'just', 'as', 'hard', 'are', 'neat', 'tied-up', 'bows', 'end', 'not', 'really.Yes', 'DVD', 'extras', 'disappointing', 'bigger', 'disappointment', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'play', 'had', 'been', 'adapted', 'half-ass', 'manner', 'can', 'live', 'extras']",Angels in America

Al Pacino takes the cake in this respect in his usual fiery intelligent way. No one else really talked about Belize played by Jeffrey Wright whose going between three principal characters requires a great deal of role changes as well as skill (not to mention his amusing depiction of Mr. Lies). Watch his description of Heaven to Al Pacino's character very carefully, the calculated intelligence mixed with loathing spite. I think Justin Kirk goes a little too over the top at times but his scenes with Meryl Streep are great to watch. The production only falls short with Mary Louise Parker's character. She reads her lines indifferently and is altogether annoying. I wanted a little more passion and bite from her. Another disappointment is the sort of forced ending.

806064,A1JUYF5D6TFFHB,B0001I2BUI,"Rudy Avila ""Saint Seiya""","[9, 25]","2003's Angels In America, directed by Mike Nichols, aired on HBO and won the most Emmy Awards for best series. The 6 hour series (yes it is very long and comes in two DVD's) stars Meryl Streep, Al Pacino, Marie Louise Parker, Emma Thompson, among others. The lines between reality and fantasy are blurred as the main theme seems to be that angels in Heaven are suffering an enormous crisis- God has abandoned the Universe out of his disappointment with mankind. Set in the 80's, during the Presidency of Ronald Reagan and the AIDS outbreak, the series follows the lives of gay couple Prior and Louis and straight couple Joe and Harper. When Prior is diagnosed with AIDS, Louis abandons him and hooks up with Joe, who has been a closeted gay all the while he was married to Harper. Joe is by far the most interesting character. Raised a Mormon, a Republican lawyer who works for Roy Cohn, notorious for secret evil doings and political machinations. Prior, though, is the focus of the movie. He is visited by an angel (Emma Thompson) who declares him a Prophet and who takes him to heaven where he is gives specific instructions on how to make the world right again with or without God. I never understand the need for the religious symbolism and business with angels, but it seems to work beautifully, a great symbolic metaphor and contrast for the real and scary world down below in New York City and in San Francisco. Be warned however, this was an HBO series and contains a ton of foul language, nudity and sex- mostly homosexual sex. The theatrical play was much better, despite the advantage of using computer graphics, the New York City location including the ""angel"" statue in the Park and other visual elements. This is strictly an adult movie with adult content and at no times must this be viewed by children or younger viewers. Kudos to Meryl Streep for her sensational performance as three people- the Rabbi as the movie opens, Joe's Mormon mother who is nevertheless strong, opinionated, courageous and forgiving and as the famous executed Communist lady who looks like a 30's, 40's Eleanor Roosevelt type of woman. Al Pacino, too, deserves credit and applause as Roy Cohn.

Al Pacino, Meryl Streep, Emma Thompson, Mary Louise Parker, and a bevy of others all turn in outstanding performances. Al Pacino is especially good and brings a lot of verve and ultra right-wing nastiness and awfulness to the real life figure of Ray Cohn. The direction and writing are also excellent, with the dialogue verging on Shakespearan at some points--it's a joy to listen to. The film touches on a multitude of subjects, including what it meant to be gay in 1980s Reagan America. It cemented my view that having a more liberal, left wing perspective somehow makes one more human, because right wing politics oftentimes has no room for tolerance and inclusiveness. Indeed, that seemed the main message of the film--we are all human and in this together no matter what our age, race, or sexual preference.

806074,A342EHO42V2G38,B0001I2BUI,"Terran ""Terran""","[4, 14]","There are no extras on the DVD package, not even the obligatory HBO Presents documentary they do for other films.  Otherwise, the positive elements are the cover art, and the basic 2-disk box.  When it comes to the casting, the famous leads did not produce the best work in this series, let alone the best work of their careers, but they earned the accolades anyway.  They were marquee value.  However, Al Pacino does perform subtle work in his scenes with Joe Pitt (Patrick Wilson), a would-be son or convert, whom he is attempting to seduce to the dark side professionally and into a sexual relationship personally, but so refined about it, even the target doesn't have a clue: The editing spotlights Pacino's stroking Wilson's shoulder more than once to make sure the audience gets what is really going on.  Often, though, Pacino is merely yelling at the top of his lungs as the serpent morphs into a spoiled brat.  When it comes to Meryl Streep, with multiple roles, she is typical Meryl Streep, and nothing to be said for or against.  She is just there.  Emma Thompson is forgettable as a nurse, yet wonderful - even incandescent - as the angel who is visiting the ""prophet"" character of Pryor as he sinks in health due to AIDS.  And another multiple-part actor is Jeffrey Wright, who is appearing all over the place here, but most important as Pryor's friend and Cohn's (Pacino's) nurse.  But there is no reasonable excuse for having the multiple parts as-played-by-a-few-actors gimmick, not in the HBO production.  This hurts the drama, though a case may be made that Emma is a sympathetic nurse and therefore assumes the guise of angel in Pryor's heated visions for that reason.  As the nurse, she is there to witness Pryor's lover's abandonment.  Why Streep would be a fifties' casualty as well as a concerned Mormon mother, I have no idea, as there is no link.  The best lead acting comes from the actors Justin Kirk and Patrick Wilson, with Kirk as Pryor railing against his fate and his abandonment by his lover - Louis - and Wilson as Pitt, trying to reconcile the fact he is striving to be a perfect Mormon while also facing his attraction to men, and the fact he can't keep his wife satisfied, no matter how much he sublimates his true desires. He is the character having to face guilt whether he stays on with his current lifestyle or starts a new one.  Complicating Pitt's decision process is his fear of abandoning his wife, Harper, who has a chemical dependency problem only more pronounced by her sexual frustration (she knows her hunky husband doesn't want her sexually; hell, even his nickname for her is 'buddy' and you can't get less sexual than that).  So you have two characters hallucinating, Pryor and Harper, as they are the physically ailing ones suffering issues of abandonment and betrayal.  Mary-Louise Parker as Harper is the same dry-wit sorry-for-myself character she has made a career of playing, it's become her schtick, and her most affecting scene is probably when she's facing her mother-in-law and pointing out the mannequin which has the same face as her husband - and the mannequin is representing the ideal of Mormon male heading out to new territory in spite of the dangers en route (Utah).  In reality, Harper is on her own as her husband is investigating his new lifestyle like a committed zealot - but this is a journey Harper can't take with him. As a break from all the drama, most of the Harper and Pryor scenes are played for laughs, even Pryor's first glimpse of ""malboro man"" Pitt (Wilson).  But Justin Kirk is able to utilize the liberation his character has so he seems the only person having fun.  Patrick Wilson has the most complicated multi-dimensional character (the rest are two-dimensional) as we follow his agonizing cycle.  For those keeping track, Kirk and Wilson do the stripping in the film, for Wilson maybe by rote a stripping as he did in the Broadway musical ""The Full Monty,"" only this is for dramatic emphasis, even desperation, as his character is illustrating the breakthrough he has made, shedding his skin (clothing) literally and figuratively, removing even the underwear which is part of the Mormon uniform.  The overall weakness of the play working against this splendid cast and all their efforts is the glorification of socialism against conservatism, in a quite simplistic sort of way - ANGELS IN AMERICA is truly a black-and-white film.  And the ending of the film, which deals with certain characters' fates and not others, is sloppy.  Finally, the immature intolerance displayed in the character of Louis, which hardly makes him the knight in shining armor I think the writer intends, perhaps the alter-ego of the author himself, makes a POV so pretentious seem quite childish.

The dialogue was wonderful and, even without seeing an actor as Roy Cohn, some scenes just jumped right off the page.When I heard that HBO was sinking tens of millions of dollars into a mini-series of it, I was afraid that their worst tendencies would overwhelm the production.And it did, for the most part.If they wanted to rip it up with the surreal angel scenes, they should've got the deranged English director Ken Russell (ALTERED STATES, TOMMY) instead of the socially-conscious Mike Nichols.  But I'm sure Russell would've also monkeyed with the rest of the play's carefully crafted messages.  (To be honest, I don't wish Russell on anybody: read the bio of legendary screenwriter Paddy Chayefsky to see that).And what did the angel scenes really lead up to?  The ""prophet"" she announces climbs the ladder into Heaven...and tells God what he can do with it.  All the hours of weaving a complex story of personal human interaction are capped off with the sullen petulance of a child-like reproach.It is revealing as a mentality (""Nothing Is My Fault""), but as drama it doesn't work as well.But a lot of scenes really work and the cast is great, but the ending is a let-down.  And some of the hallucinations are just indulgent messes.I've watched shows like ANGELS IN AMERICA and AND THE BAND PLAYED ON (the book was infinitely better), and I've noticed a lot of historical revisionism going on: Ronald Reagan was NOT responsible for the AIDS epidemic in the 1980's.  I was there and saw it: at the news of a new ""gay disease"" striking down gays in San Francisco and New York, the Reagan Administration ordered the bathhouses in Frisco shut down until the situation could be evaluated...and the gays just about burned City Hall to the ground to keep them open.  And for the virus to spread even more.In 1987 or '88, the USA spent $700 million dollars on AIDS research and $77 million on breast cancer research, the leading cause of death for women.  That was in USA Today.When I see desperate characters in movies like ANGELS IN AMERICA berating the government for ""not caring"" about what's happening, I remember the truth: the people most at risk didn't allow anyone to care.They screamed for help while pushing it away.",2,Mike Nichols Tries to Be Ken Russell,1127088000,"09 19, 2005",2005,2362,"['remember', 'sitting', 'Barnes', 'Noble', 'reading', 'part', 'ANGELS', 'IN', 'AMERICA', ""'90s"", 'wondering', 'how', 'would', 'play', 'onstage', 'dialogue', 'was', 'wonderful', 'even', 'seeing', 'actor', 'Roy', 'Cohn', 'scenes', 'just', 'jumped', 'right', 'page.When', 'heard', 'HBO', 'was', 'sinking', 'tens', 'millions', 'dollars', 'mini-series', 'was', 'afraid', 'worst', 'tendencies', 'would', 'overwhelm', 'production.And', 'did', 'most', 'part.If', 'wanted', 'rip', 'up', 'surreal', 'angel', 'scenes', 'should', ""'ve"", 'got', 'deranged', 'English', 'director', 'Ken', 'Russell', 'ALTERED', 'STATES', 'TOMMY', 'instead', 'socially-conscious', 'Mike', 'Nichols', ""'m"", 'sure', 'Russell', 'would', ""'ve"", 'also', 'monkeyed', 'rest', 'play', 'carefully', 'crafted', 'messages', 'be', 'honest', 'do', ""n't"", 'wish', 'Russell', 'anybody', 'read', 'bio', 'legendary', 'screenwriter', 'Paddy', 'Chayefsky', 'see', '.And', 'what', 'did', 'angel', 'scenes', 'really', 'lead', 'up', 'prophet', 'ladder', 'Heaven', 'tells', 'God', 'what', 'can', 'do', 'hours', 'weaving', 'complex', 'story', 'personal', 'human', 'interaction', 'are', 'capped', 'sullen', 'petulance', 'child-like', 'reproach.It', 'revealing', 'mentality', 'Nothing', 'Fault', 'drama', ""n't"", 'work', 'as', 'well.But', 'lot', 'scenes', 'really', 'work', 'cast', 'great', 'ending', 'let-down', 'hallucinations', 'are', 'just', 'indulgent', 'messes.I', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'shows', 'ANGELS', 'IN', 'AMERICA', 'AND', 'THE', 'BAND', 'PLAYED', 'ON', 'book', 'was', 'infinitely', 'better', ""'ve"", 'noticed', 'lot', 'historical', 'revisionism', 'going', 'Ronald', 'Reagan', 'was', 'NOT', 'responsible', 'AIDS', 'epidemic', '1980', 'was', 'there', 'saw', 'news', 'new', 'gay', 'disease', 'striking', 'down', 'gays', 'San', 'Francisco', 'New', 'York', 'Reagan', 'Administration', 'ordered', 'bathhouses', 'Frisco', 'shut', 'down', 'situation', 'could', 'be', 'evaluated', 'gays', 'just', 'burned', 'City', 'Hall', 'ground', 'keep', 'open', 'virus', 'spread', 'even', 'more.In', '1987', ""'88"", 'USA', 'spent', '700', 'million', 'dollars', 'AIDS', 'research', '77', 'million', 'breast', 'cancer', 'research', 'leading', 'cause', 'death', 'women', 'was', 'USA', 'Today.When', 'see', 'desperate', 'characters', 'movies', 'ANGELS', 'IN', 'AMERICA', 'berating', 'government', 'not', 'caring', 'what', 'happening', 'remember', 'truth', 'people', 'most', 'risk', 'did', ""n't"", 'allow', 'anyone', 'care.They', 'screamed', 'help', 'pushing', 'away']",Angels in America

It had potential to be a powerful film (I especially enjoyed the big appearance of Emma Thompson in ""Stop Moving!"").  But after 6 hours of watching, the main two couples couldn't reconcile their differences, and split. There were also three characters with loose ends, which don't get me wrong, a movie needn't be stupidly happy, but five years passed, and we learned nothing of one of the original couples, or of what happened in Heaven.  Did God return? Or was it like waiting for Godot, and he never showed up? They didn't even give us the courtesy of that one.And all of this might have been okay but for the last problem. As my acting teacher said, ""show us, don't tell us.""  They had not one, but about five characters fourth-wall monologue. It was trite and preachy, and after six hours, what you wanted to know about wasn't told, and instead you got some story of the angel Bethesda.Ultimately, after a six hour film, you want something grand or meaningful (like the Mahabharata where they are tested in heaven against their enemies). This was neither, the scene in heaven kinda fizzled, about when he went on about suing God.  Yeah, I know there was this whole metaphor for the male figure leaving, but still...

It's intense for the first time I can feel man's struggle with ""afterlife"" strongly depicted before television since I have read AFTERLIFE by Paul Monnette many years ago. The emotions are vibrantly interpreted and deeply revealed, and so real that I can relate beyond my non-religious mentality with the character of Prior Walter (Justin Kirk) for subconsciously praying for an angel (Emma Thompson) to save his battled world.Only a little annoying for me is the racistic, impulsive Louis Ironson but only because Ben Shenkman is playing the subduedly offensive character so well. Both Patrick Wilson [THE ALAMO, THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA 2004] and Mary Louise Parker [THE BEST THIEF IN THE WORLD, SAVED!], who play the sexless Pitt couple, had offered the series certain degree of nudity of disputable subjects yet not in a slight light-hearted method.ANGELS IN AMERICA is a profound result to efforts of faithfully devoted believers from home box behind-the-scenes in making one's purest sacred hopes and prayers come true on screen.

To say that it revolves around a gay man who is suffering with AIDS, while true, does not give a fair idea of its content. The man does indeed encouter an angel, played by Emma Thompson. Also in the drama is Roy Cohn, himself dying of AIDS, and haunted by hallucinations in which Emma Rosenberg, the ""convicted atomic spy"", appears to him. The cast of this imaginative drama includes Emma Thompson, Meryl Streep, Jeffery Wright, and Al Pacino playing Roy Cohn. Each of these actors plays multiple roles. The entire cast is outstanding. The film treats Kutchner's play with great flair and visual imagination. It is a quite gripping and believable work of imagination, in a style that might perhaps be best described as ""magical realism""; and it is very well realized.

It was only Wednesday night when I popped it into the player and was knocked for a loop. (I can't think of a less-trite expression.)It is, first and formost, a brutal, testicle-kicking attack on post-Reagan ""conservatism"". It's fortunate that Roy Cohn -- one of the most-vicious American politicians of the last century, and a homosexual who died of AIDS -- actually existed, so that Tony Kushner did not have to invent him. He is a convenient personification of everything the author (and I) detest in American society.I am at a loss to say anything ""intelligent"" (or even original) about a movie in which every character is deeply flawed, a film that is sufficiently complex (and ambiguous, where appropriate) that it cannot reveal everything in a single viewing. ""Angels in America"" is worth seeing simply for the quality of writing, acting, and direction. (The special effects ain't bad, either.)If I have any complaints, it's that theatrical metaphor -- which is acceptable within a stage work's lack of literal reality -- can seem a bit heavy-handed in a film, which appears to be literally real.It's a mistake to view ""Angels in America"" solely as a chronicle of how AIDS devastated the gay community. Yes, it's also a polemic, but Kushner gets away with it by remembering that you cannot tell a story about ideas, you can only tell a story about people.Like any Great Work Of Art (and it is one), it is, fundamentally, about how human beings cope with life.
