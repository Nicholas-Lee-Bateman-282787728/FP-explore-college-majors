1529821,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B007CEFTSA,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 5]","It's funny how `Albert Nobbs' went from being Glenn Close's surefire Oscar ticket (wrote, produced, starred in) to being a giant joke and ushering in a pity nomination with virtually no shot at a win whatsoever.  What's even funnier is that her film and her performance are both better than Streep's film and performance in `The Iron Lady', which won the Oscar.I'm not saying this as a giant compliment, considering that I gave `The Iron Lady' two stars (and, as you can see, I also give this film two stars), but it is a compliment nonetheless.`Albert Nobbs' tells the tale of an older woman who disguises herself as a man and works as a waiter in a bed and breakfast type establishment in 19th century Ireland.  Albert, as she goes by, is a quiet and reserved man, but after a chance meeting with another cross-dresser he becomes a tad more secure in his boots so-to-speak and tries to envision a future that includes a wife.  He sets his eyes on a pretty young woman named Hannah who happens to work alongside Albert.  She is in love with Joe, a young man working the boiler room, but Albert pursues her and she takes him for a ride, collecting gifts along the way.  Albert has smaller dreams than Hannah though, and so their relationship is doomed from the beginning.Albert's story is about more than this relationship though.Sadly, that story isn't given enough depth.  It flirts with that depth, but it lends too much focus to Albert's fixation on Hannah and Hannah's relationship with Joe to break down Albert in a way that needed to be done.  Close actually delivers a wonderful performance though, for she strips all traces of the hammy theatrics we've come to expect from her and actually delivers a soft and introverted performance.  She says so much with her eyes; trying desperately to elaborate on Nobb's backstory despite the fact that the film doesn't seem too keen on giving us that backstory.  I'm sorry, but as heartbreaking as her traumatic childhood was, it doesn't really give due answer to WHY Albert dresses as a man.  So, the film hands us a half-baked relationship centering on a faulty infatuation with a spoiled young brat who exploited the affections of a `fool of a man'.  Wasikowska is good though, better than McTeer who rode the coattails of a gimmick to an Oscar nomination.I'm saddened by the lazy way in which this story was told, because it really could have been much deeper and much more special than what we were left with.  The ending in particular was such a strange way to close the story, and the film is littered with moments that attempt to say more than they actually do and are bogged down by the sheer oddity of it all (that beach scene in particular was hard to watch).  Maybe there was no other way to end this story, because the story itself lacked the ability to progress any further, but ultimately it winds up feeling empty and hallow and definitely not what poor Mrs. Close intended.Oh, but Brendan Gleeson should keep the beard; always.",2,Confused themes taint the film's focus...,1344816000,"08 13, 2012",2012,2993,"['funny', 'how', 'Albert', 'Nobbs', 'went', 'being', 'Glenn', 'Close', 'surefire', 'Oscar', 'ticket', 'wrote', 'produced', 'starred', 'being', 'giant', 'joke', 'ushering', 'pity', 'nomination', 'virtually', 'shot', 'win', 'whatsoever', 'What', 'even', 'funnier', 'film', 'performance', 'are', 'better', 'Streep', 'film', 'performance', 'Iron', 'Lady', 'won', 'Oscar.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'giant', 'compliment', 'considering', 'gave', 'Iron', 'Lady', 'two', 'stars', 'can', 'see', 'also', 'give', 'film', 'two', 'stars', 'compliment', 'nonetheless.', 'Albert', 'Nobbs', 'tale', 'older', 'woman', 'who', 'man', 'waiter', 'bed', 'breakfast', 'type', 'establishment', '19th', 'century', 'Ireland', 'Albert', 'quiet', 'reserved', 'man', 'chance', 'meeting', 'cross-dresser', 'tad', 'more', 'secure', 'boots', 'so-to-speak', 'tries', 'envision', 'future', 'wife', 'eyes', 'pretty', 'young', 'woman', 'named', 'Hannah', 'who', 'work', 'alongside', 'Albert', 'love', 'Joe', 'young', 'man', 'working', 'boiler', 'room', 'Albert', 'ride', 'collecting', 'gifts', 'way', 'Albert', 'smaller', 'dreams', 'Hannah', 'so', 'relationship', 'doomed', 'beginning.Albert', 'story', 'more', 'relationship', 'though.Sadly', 'story', ""n't"", 'given', 'enough', 'depth', 'depth', 'too', 'much', 'focus', 'Albert', 'fixation', 'Hannah', 'Hannah', 'relationship', 'Joe', 'break', 'down', 'Albert', 'way', 'needed', 'be', 'done', 'Close', 'actually', 'wonderful', 'performance', 'traces', 'hammy', 'theatrics', ""'ve"", 'come', 'expect', 'actually', 'soft', 'introverted', 'performance', 'so', 'much', 'eyes', 'trying', 'desperately', 'elaborate', 'Nobb', 'backstory', 'fact', 'film', ""n't"", 'seem', 'too', 'keen', 'giving', 'backstory', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'as', 'heartbreaking', 'traumatic', 'childhood', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'give', 'due', 'answer', 'WHY', 'Albert', 'man', 'So', 'film', 'half-baked', 'relationship', 'centering', 'faulty', 'infatuation', 'spoiled', 'young', 'brat', 'who', 'exploited', 'affections', 'fool', 'man', 'Wasikowska', 'good', 'better', 'McTeer', 'who', 'rode', 'coattails', 'gimmick', 'Oscar', 'nomination.I', ""'m"", 'saddened', 'lazy', 'way', 'story', 'was', 'told', 'really', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'deeper', 'much', 'more', 'special', 'what', 'were', 'left', 'ending', 'particular', 'was', 'such', 'strange', 'way', 'close', 'story', 'film', 'littered', 'moments', 'attempt', 'say', 'more', 'actually', 'do', 'are', 'bogged', 'down', 'sheer', 'oddity', 'beach', 'scene', 'particular', 'was', 'hard', 'watch', 'Maybe', 'was', 'other', 'way', 'end', 'story', 'story', 'lacked', 'ability', 'progress', 'further', 'ultimately', 'up', 'feeling', 'empty', 'hallow', 'definitely', 'not', 'what', 'poor', 'Mrs.', 'Close', 'intended.Oh', 'Brendan', 'Gleeson', 'should', 'keep', 'beard', 'always']",Albert Nobbs

1529825,A3VIOCJZ22JZXT,B007CEFTSA,C. B Collins Jr.,"[3, 3]","This is an exceptional film in every way. It has a unique but fully human storyline; it is perfectly acted with an outstanding cast; the screenplay is perfect - not a word misspent; and the setting and costumes are accurate and give a sense of time and place to the entire production. I am a complete fan of this excellent film and would strongly recommend it.Glenn Close does one of the most outstanding acting jobs in film history and compares to Anne Bancroft in The Miracle Worker for skill and excellence. Only Elizabeth Taylor's performance in Who's afraid of Virginia Wolfe can top Glenn Close's performance.  It is restrained and perfectly executed.  This was also my first introduction to the actress Janet McTeer, who plays the role of a poor widow who takes on her deceased husband's name, masculine role, and profession to survive in an economically depressed Dublin. Mia Wasikowska and Aaron Johnson play essential roles in the film and do an excellent job.The story is compelling on a personal level and on a social justice level. Albert Nobbs is the story of a young illegitimate child placed in an orphanage and then raped as an adolescent who becomes a male waiter to survive financially. Albert dreams of being a small tobacco shop owner one day. However, the interactions with Mr. Sands, played by Janet McTeer, open Albert up to the idea of having a life partner who will help him with his business. A series of events follows that are tragic and yet part of the human frailty we all encounter.The film is also an interesting study in gender and sexuality and is one of the best examples of separating gender identity and sexual desire. In this case economic and social forces put Albert into the position of assuming a male gender identity most of his life and not much is ever revealed about his sexual desires, only his desire for a companion in life, something surely we all deserve. Such an excellent film deserves a wide viewership.

1529826,AB34G6VKP28L,B007CEFTSA,"Charity Bishop ""Film Fanatic""","[11, 15]","It is rare that I find myself ambiguous about my feelings toward a film, but upon completing ""Albert Nobbs,"" I am not quite certain what to make of it other than that it is a story that takes chances.Albert Nobbs (Glenn Close) is respected in the reputable boardinghouse where he serves as a butler. A man of few words who keeps much to himself, he is most distressed when it is learned that he must share his room for the night for a man hired to paint one of the rooms -- Hubert Page (Janet McTeer). In the midst of this awkward scene, a secret that he has kept from everyone in the house is found out -- he is in fact a she, living as a butler in a time when a woman cannot make it on her own in the world. At first, Albert is terrified that she will be found out, but then discovers something even more extraordinary -- her dreams of saving up enough to own a tobacco shop are within her reach. Mr. Page is living proof -- for he too has a secret, and it is no different from her own. But he has made a success of it, and even found a wife with which to make himself appear respectable.Emboldened with a newfound faith that she will not have to go through life alone, Albert begins to shyly walk out with a housemaid, Helen (Mia Wasikowska), not realizing that Helen's interest in her is only for monetary purposes, at the behest of her new boyfriend (Aaron Johnson). The repercussions of these events will change all of their lives forever.Controversial as the subject matter is, it is also uncertain in drawing its conclusions. Some audiences feel that Albert is not a homosexual but rather a woman who saw a chance to become someone else, someone who would never be preyed on in society, and clung to it, emerging out of an abusive past that made her more comfortable in a disguise. Others, particularly in the gay and lesbian communities, have embraced it as a film that reveals the emotional complexities of gender difficulties in a time when such things were unimaginable. We never get a sense if Albert's desire to have a ""wife"" and a life outside the boardinghouse goes beyond the desire for companionship, although the presentation of Mr. Page is far more flatly outlined: he/she is very much in love with his/her female partner and they share a complete married life that finds the wife objecting to his/her notice of other young ladies. Even so, it's hard to latch on emotionally to the film; it is awkward and uncomfortable at the best of times, with an engaging subplot and an unsatisfying conclusion. I'm not sure if it is the subject matter that made me uneasy or if there's simply something lacking in the screenplay, but whatever it was, it pales in contrast with the performances, which are rich and memorable in their own right.I am not quite certain what to make of this film. It made me uncomfortable in certain ways that are inexpressible, possibly because it is so ambiguous. In spite of being beautifully filmed, with a delightful cast that includes cameos from the likes of Jonathan Rhys Myers and Maria Doyle Kennedy, the audience is left not knowing how they are meant to feel, other than in mourning for a life that was not lived to the fullest. Our heart goes out to Albert even as we worry about Helen, but wanting them to be together is difficult, primarily because Helen does not know the truth. Yet it is fear that comes across the most strongly in every frame -- fear of discovery, of being outed, of having to give up the facade. In one poignant scene, Albert dons a dress and walks out on the beach -- she winds up running, laughing, free in the wind, for once liberated from her disguise... and then returns once more to the dour suit of a butler.Both eerie and disturbing in the smallest of ways, Albert Nobbs is a film I won't soon forget... but not one I would care to revisit.",3,Unusual & Creepy,1332374400,"03 22, 2012",2012,3821,"['rare', 'find', 'ambiguous', 'feelings', 'film', 'completing', 'Albert', 'Nobbs', 'am', 'not', 'quite', 'certain', 'what', 'make', 'other', 'story', 'chances.Albert', 'Nobbs', 'Glenn', 'Close', 'respected', 'reputable', 'boardinghouse', 'where', 'butler', 'man', 'few', 'words', 'who', 'keeps', 'much', 'most', 'distressed', 'when', 'learned', 'must', 'share', 'room', 'night', 'man', 'hired', 'paint', 'one', 'rooms', 'Hubert', 'Page', 'Janet', 'McTeer', 'midst', 'awkward', 'scene', 'secret', 'kept', 'everyone', 'house', 'found', 'out', 'fact', 'living', 'butler', 'time', 'when', 'woman', 'can', 'not', 'make', 'own', 'world', 'first', 'Albert', 'terrified', 'will', 'be', 'found', 'out', 'then', 'discovers', 'something', 'even', 'more', 'extraordinary', 'dreams', 'saving', 'up', 'enough', 'own', 'tobacco', 'shop', 'are', 'reach', 'Mr', 'Page', 'living', 'proof', 'too', 'secret', 'different', 'own', 'made', 'success', 'even', 'found', 'wife', 'make', 'appear', 'respectable.Emboldened', 'newfound', 'faith', 'will', 'not', 'have', 'go', 'life', 'alone', 'Albert', 'shyly', 'walk', 'out', 'housemaid', 'Helen', 'Mia', 'Wasikowska', 'not', 'realizing', 'Helen', 'interest', 'only', 'monetary', 'purposes', 'behest', 'new', 'boyfriend', 'Aaron', 'Johnson', 'repercussions', 'events', 'will', 'change', 'lives', 'forever.Controversial', 'subject', 'matter', 'also', 'uncertain', 'drawing', 'conclusions', 'audiences', 'feel', 'Albert', 'not', 'homosexual', 'rather', 'woman', 'who', 'saw', 'chance', 'become', 'someone', 'else', 'someone', 'who', 'would', 'never', 'be', 'preyed', 'society', 'clung', 'emerging', 'abusive', 'past', 'made', 'more', 'comfortable', 'disguise', 'Others', 'particularly', 'gay', 'lesbian', 'communities', 'have', 'embraced', 'film', 'emotional', 'complexities', 'gender', 'difficulties', 'time', 'when', 'such', 'things', 'were', 'unimaginable', 'never', 'get', 'sense', 'Albert', 'desire', 'have', 'wife', 'life', 'boardinghouse', 'desire', 'companionship', 'presentation', 'Mr', 'Page', 'far', 'more', 'flatly', 'outlined', 'he/she', 'very', 'much', 'love', 'his/her', 'female', 'partner', 'share', 'complete', 'married', 'life', 'wife', 'objecting', 'his/her', 'notice', 'other', 'young', 'ladies', 'Even', 'so', 'hard', 'latch', 'emotionally', 'film', 'awkward', 'uncomfortable', 'best', 'times', 'engaging', 'subplot', 'unsatisfying', 'conclusion', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'subject', 'matter', 'made', 'uneasy', 'simply', 'something', 'lacking', 'screenplay', 'whatever', 'was', 'contrast', 'performances', 'are', 'rich', 'memorable', 'own', 'right.I', 'am', 'not', 'quite', 'certain', 'what', 'make', 'film', 'made', 'uncomfortable', 'certain', 'ways', 'are', 'inexpressible', 'possibly', 'so', 'ambiguous', 'spite', 'being', 'beautifully', 'filmed', 'delightful', 'cast', 'cameos', 'likes', 'Jonathan', 'Rhys', 'Myers', 'Maria', 'Doyle', 'Kennedy', 'audience', 'left', 'not', 'knowing', 'how', 'are', 'meant', 'feel', 'other', 'mourning', 'life', 'was', 'not', 'lived', 'fullest', 'heart', 'out', 'Albert', 'even', 'worry', 'Helen', 'wanting', 'be', 'together', 'difficult', 'primarily', 'Helen', 'not', 'know', 'truth', 'fear', 'most', 'strongly', 'frame', 'fear', 'discovery', 'being', 'outed', 'having', 'give', 'up', 'facade', 'one', 'poignant', 'scene', 'Albert', 'dress', 'out', 'beach', 'up', 'running', 'laughing', 'free', 'wind', 'once', 'liberated', 'disguise', 'then', 'once', 'more', 'dour', 'suit', 'eerie', 'disturbing', 'smallest', 'ways', 'Albert', 'Nobbs', 'film', 'wo', ""n't"", 'soon', 'forget', 'not', 'one', 'would', 'care', 'revisit']",Albert Nobbs

1529829,A2ZY49IDE6TY5I,B007CEFTSA,"Crabigail Cassidy ""Crabby Abby""","[1, 1]","One never knows what to expect when the main character in a movie changes their gender. You can end up watching Tony Curtis and Jack Lemon pull off some brilliant comedy or you can get Glenn Close and Janet McTeer in Albert Nobbs.Albert Nobbs is a terrific movie and unfortunately one that really didn't go into wide release. I missed it during its short run last winter in the local theaters, but the DVD release has rectified that. The plot is essentially this. An impoverished young woman assumes a male identity in order to work as a waiter in a hotel. She works for years saving her wages and tips with the goal of eventually owning her own business. As Albert Nobbs, Glenn Close portrays a fragile human being who longs for normalcy and security and also love.The arrival of a young maid turns Nobbs' life around and he begins courting the maid with the hope that they'll eventually marry, go into business, and eventually raise a family. If this sounds confusing, it is. However, the way this is scripted makes it readily apparent that Nobbs has accepted his maleness but is not necessarily sure what to do about it. In the process, she meets a handyman who is also a woman who has publicly assumed the identity of a man and even has his own wife. Played by Janet McTeer as the handyman, this provides Nobbs with a friend that he can relate to while he tries to sort things out.While there are brief and fleeting moments of humor in this movie, I found it interesting that it was so easy to accept and buy into this plot as I watched this film and wondered what was going to happen next. This movie wasn't predictable, but it was remarkably easy to get involved in the story and feel sympathetic with the Albert Nobbs character. The script could have evolved into something trivial and mean spirited, but it never did. The acting, in its entirety, was extremely good though Close and McTeer shined in their challenging roles.Beyond the script, story, and acting, the photography was beautiful and evoked its time and setting.This is a wonderful film that really tugs at the heart strings without getting maudlin or ridiculous.",5,One of the Best Movies of the Past Year,1339977600,"06 18, 2012",2012,2133,"['One', 'never', 'what', 'expect', 'when', 'main', 'character', 'movie', 'gender', 'can', 'end', 'up', 'watching', 'Tony', 'Curtis', 'Jack', 'Lemon', 'pull', 'off', 'brilliant', 'comedy', 'can', 'get', 'Glenn', 'Close', 'Janet', 'McTeer', 'Albert', 'Nobbs.Albert', 'Nobbs', 'terrific', 'movie', 'unfortunately', 'one', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'go', 'wide', 'release', 'missed', 'short', 'run', 'last', 'winter', 'local', 'theaters', 'DVD', 'release', 'rectified', 'plot', 'essentially', 'impoverished', 'young', 'woman', 'male', 'identity', 'order', 'work', 'waiter', 'hotel', 'years', 'saving', 'wages', 'tips', 'goal', 'eventually', 'owning', 'own', 'business', 'Albert', 'Nobbs', 'Glenn', 'Close', 'fragile', 'human', 'being', 'who', 'normalcy', 'security', 'also', 'love.The', 'arrival', 'young', 'maid', 'Nobbs', 'life', 'around', 'courting', 'maid', 'hope', ""'ll"", 'eventually', 'marry', 'go', 'business', 'eventually', 'raise', 'family', 'confusing', 'However', 'way', 'scripted', 'readily', 'apparent', 'Nobbs', 'accepted', 'maleness', 'not', 'necessarily', 'sure', 'what', 'do', 'process', 'handyman', 'who', 'also', 'woman', 'who', 'publicly', 'assumed', 'identity', 'man', 'even', 'own', 'wife', 'Played', 'Janet', 'McTeer', 'handyman', 'Nobbs', 'friend', 'can', 'relate', 'sort', 'things', 'are', 'brief', 'fleeting', 'moments', 'humor', 'movie', 'found', 'interesting', 'was', 'so', 'easy', 'accept', 'buy', 'plot', 'watched', 'film', 'wondered', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'happen', 'next', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'predictable', 'was', 'remarkably', 'easy', 'get', 'involved', 'story', 'feel', 'sympathetic', 'Albert', 'Nobbs', 'character', 'script', 'could', 'have', 'evolved', 'something', 'trivial', 'mean', 'spirited', 'never', 'did', 'acting', 'entirety', 'was', 'extremely', 'good', 'Close', 'McTeer', 'shined', 'challenging', 'roles.Beyond', 'script', 'story', 'acting', 'photography', 'was', 'beautiful', 'evoked', 'time', 'setting.This', 'wonderful', 'film', 'really', 'heart', 'strings', 'getting', 'maudlin', 'ridiculous']",Albert Nobbs

Glenn Close's performance is far too restrained, to the extent that she hardly seemed more than a wax figure most of the time. Janet McTeer's performance, on the other hand, is nothing short of spectacular. Here is a woman who has had to live her life in disguise but has found a way to be happy, and looks to be very comfortable, not only in the disguise, but in her own skin. The only exception is when the two women don dresses for a brief foray into public. They both look incredibly awkward, but that's great acting for you. So many questions were left unanswered, which was frustrating. It was hinted at that we might find out who Albert's mother was, but that never happened. We didn't even find out what her real name had been. The sets and costumes were amazing and really gave the whole film a feeling of authenticity. I might have given the film 4 stars because of the great acting on the part of the others in the cast: a terrific Pauline Collins, Brendan Gleeson, Brenda Fricker, Aaron Johnson and Mia Wasikowska; but I took off an additional star because whoever produced the DVD forgot to put in scene selection functionality, which was really stupid.

A poignant if sometimes rather coy screenplay that deprives us of some of the moments we would like to have witnessed.  This might actually be a virtue, though.  Poor Albert -- partly, it seems, because of horrible life experiences, and perhaps partly too by nature -- is always extremely reticent and perhaps, it would seem, not very intelligent.  This makes us feel even more sorry for him/her; but it certainly also makes this film less ""entertaining"" than some would want.  If you're looking for snappy dialog, you won't find very much of that here.  This, of course, is not necessarily a bad thing.  Drawbacks: slightly syrupy, modernish music, especially toward the end, which detracts from the weight of the film.  Also, at least in most scenes where there is action or strong drama, there is nothing but the usual sorry excuse for cinematography that seems to be so prevalent nowadays.  We are being trained to settle for cheap, reality-show esthetics.

1529842,A328S9RN3U5M68,B007CEFTSA,Grady Harp,"[10, 10]","There is a comment spoken by maid Helen (Mia Wasikowska) as Albert Nobbs (Glenn Close) tries to court her: `You are the strangest man I have ever met.' And that is most assuredly true - Albert Nobbs is a woman trapped in a man's body. Literally. Because Albert is physically, a woman who has escaped the smothering poverty of 19th-century Dublin by cutting her hair, putting on a cutaway, and taking a job as a waiter in a small, posh hotel. It's a difficult masquerade, but one she's done for decades, while carefully saving her shillings - tips she likely wouldn't get if she were just a woman, working in the kitchen - to eventually by a Tobacconist shop and live a normal life.ALBERT NOBBS is a brilliant film, a film adapted form a short by George Moore, extended by Istv&aacute;n Szab&oacute;, and adapted for the screen by John Banville, Gabriella Prekop, and star Glenn Close (Close starred in the stage version of this story years ago), and directed with sensitive finesse by Rodrigo Garc&iacute;a (son of Colombian author Gabriel Garc&iacute;a M&aacute;rquez and responsible of the penetrating television series `In Treatment'). The atmosphere of Dublin as a city is captured both in the scenery and in the psychological sense - a city that survived typhoid fever and extensive years of poverty yet still supporting a wealthy upper class.We are slowly introduced to a classy hotel run by Mrs. Baker (Pauline Collins) and with a staff of `servants/waiters' that includes the quiet and reserved Albert Nobbs. Mrs. Baker hires a down and out Lad named Joe (Aaron Johnson, remembered for his impressive performance in `Nowhere Boy') to fix the broken boiler. This allows Joe to begin to court the maid Helen: Joe discovers that Albert Nobbs seems sweet on Helen and urges her to get enough money out of dating Nobbs to get them fare to flee the poverty of Dublin and go to America.  Mrs. Baker also hires a painter, Mr Page (Janet McTeer) and while Mr Page is working there Mrs Baker insists he share a bed with Albert Nobbs. It is during this terrifying trauma for Nobbs that the two women dressed as men discover each other's secret disguises and Nobbs learns that Page is married to Cathleen (Bronagh Gallagher). Nobbs future hopes brighten - she is saving all her money hidden in the floor of her room - until many factors takes turns of the worse: Typhoid fever strikes which decimates the hotel's business putting everyone out of a job, Helen becomes pregnant by the unwilling father Joe, Cathleen falls victim, etc. The story comes to a tragic ending, but leaves a ray of hope that perhaps Nobb's and Page's brave lives have made a difference.In addition to the brilliant performance by Glenn Close and Janet McTeer, the rest of the cast is excellent - Mia Wasikowska, Phyllida Law, Aaron Johnson,  Brenda Fricker, Maria Doyle Kennedy, Brendan Gleeson as the alcoholic but caring Dr. Holloran, Jonathan Rhys Meyers to name only a few of the fine actors in very small roles.

Close was so ridiculously not a woman that reality had to be suspended  similarly to watching males act as females in Shakespeare.  Close performance mimicked Cloris Leachman's in Young Frankenstein. I expected to hear horses neighing in the background; ridiculous, to the point of being almost funny, it was pathetically bad. Perhaps I would have bought it but for the fact that Janet McTear carried off her disguise as a female so incredibly well.  She should be given the accolades.  Her performance was not absurd.  Perhaps Close' performance, being so outrageously fake, concealed McTear's true sexual identity more, but I think the writers and directors were not that smart. I guess Glenn Close can get away with anything these days; even this unbelievable performance.

Glenn Close plays Albert Nobbs, a butler in a small hotel in Dublin where he works quietly and efficiently, keeps to himself and hoards the coins he receives as tips in hopes of someday escaping the life of service and opening his own shop. When a painter is hired temporarily and ordered to share Nobbs' room, he panics at the thought that his secret will be revealed. The painter does discover that Nobbs is actually a woman but is not shocked and agrees to keep quiet about it. We also find the reason why Nobbs is masquerading as a woman. The painter reveals his own secret, which gives Nobbs hope for the future and a new way to find connection with another person in spite of the duplicitous life he has lived for decades.The film is centered around the workers at the hotel and the relationships they form with each other. They never suspected that Nobbs was a woman, but found him to be a very odd little man. Nobbs lives a joyless, friendless, desperate life, but there is a scene where he (she) breaks free and runs on the beach with a childish abandon, smiling broadly.The setting in Dublin provides a beautiful backdrop to this period piece.

1529852,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B007CEFTSA,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[21, 24]","The film incarnation of ""Albert Nobbs"" exists as a tremendous example of perseverance and fortitude. Glenn Close first performed a stage version of the play (adapted from a short story from Irish author George Moore) in 1982. She fell in love with the material and spent the next fifteen years trying to put together a film deal. About ten years ago, the film was finally green-lit but then scrapped when financing fell through. Now almost thirty years after appearing on stage as Albert Nobbs, Close has her opportunity to share this quiet little story with a larger audience. In addition to starring in the piece, she co-wrote the screenplay, acted as a producer, and even wrote the lyrics for the closing song. I think you could call this a labor of love! Although mainstream press reaction has been somewhat mixed, Close has received numerous accolades (as has co-star Janet McTeer) including an Oscar nomination for Best Actress. It seems hard to fathom that Close lost out on her previous five nominations and hasn't been in the running since 1988 with ""Dangerous Liaisons."" But it's certainly good to see her steadfast efforts being recognized.Close is quite restrained and stoic as the titular Albert Nobbs. Set in nineteenth century Ireland, the film tells the story of a woman (Close) who has dedicated thirty years of her life passing as a man in order to make a living. Stolid and reliable, Albert has squirreled away a small fortune through the years and hopes to realize the dream of becoming a shopkeeper. Seemingly content, Albert's life is upended when he meets McTeer--a painter who has a lot more in common with Albert than it seems possible. This new friend opens up a number of interesting possibilities for Albert, making the point that life does not have to be lived alone. Albert starts to court a young co-worker (still as a man) who may have ulterior motives of her own. The film starts as a study of manners, gets a bit more frisky with the introduction of McTeer, and turns a bit darker as a number of unexpected tragedies strike (both large and small). The play of genders is always fascinating and the idea of living a lie just to get by ends up having quite a bit of resonance.Close is tight-lipped and reserved throughout. It's a strong performance highlighted as much by what she doesn't say as what she does. McTeer really energizes the picture with enthusiasm and humor, and much of the film's success rests on her shoulders. Two terrific up-and-comers, Mia Wasikowska and Aaron Johnson, also play pivotal roles (much more interesting casting than the originally slated Amanda Seyfried and Orlando Bloom). As Close becomes closer to Wasikowska, the gender bending dynamic evolves in an interesting way. Displaying both male and female impulses inwardly, Albert both wants to take care of the young lady and have a confidante. The cast is rounded out by a stable of reliable British actors including Pauline Collins, Brenda Fricker, Brendan Gleeson, and Jonathan Rhys Meyers. The movie has a quiet power. In the long run, it may not be for everyone. It's a little reserved at times, at others the plotting veers toward melodrama. But in the end, the actors ground the piece and make it worth investing in. Close and McTeer really provide one of the year's most fascinating screen couples.

Oleson,"[8, 11]","This little film about a woman living as a man in Ireland at the turn of the 20th century is a labor of love for star Glenn Close who also co-wrote and produced. While we do get an explanation of sorts as to why she has gone to such extraordinary lengths to live as a man, she also seems quite without emotion or sexual needs. Nobbs (Close) is all about her ability to earn a decent wage so she can save to open a tobacco shop. One thing is missing. A companion.In an awkward scene Nobbs must spend the night with a man at the behest of her employer, the owner of the upscale hotel where he (I'll continue to use the masculine pronoun) has a small room. The man named Hubert (Janet McTeer) is a painter. He is tall, rugged and formidable. Nobbs secret is discovered by Hubert, only to be surprised by Hubert's own secret. He is a woman too, as he convincingly displays his/her breasts to Albert. All of this sexual identity confusion is just that, confusing. My take is that Hubert is a lesbian. He has a sweet, meek wife and he sure looks more like a dude than Close's Nobbs. Nobbs sees a female partner as a business proposition even though you can see him trying to figure out how all the parts go together with Hubert and his wife. He keeps asking himself. Did he tell her before or after the marriage?It would appear Nobbs is just asexual. Nobbs sets his sights on a comely chambermaid he works with named Helen (Mia Wasikowska). Now Helen has taken up with another young worker at the hotel. He is a studly handyman named Joe who only wants to get to America. Nobbs is undetered and continues his persuit of Helen, even after she becomes pregnant. Directed by Rodrigo Garcia, the film plods along in a quiet unassuming way. Close's performance is excellent in her portrait of the nave waiter. He really has no life, but has grown to be more a man than a woman. Even better is McTeer. She is quite believable and a very interesting character. In the end, we still have a lot of questions about who Albert Nobbs is.

1529866,A3HJAIFRRFHUAB,B007CEFTSA,"Phred ""Phred""","[4, 4]","First, the plot: The movie Albert Nobbs is set in 19 century Ireland. In this time and place, poverty meant misery and usually a bad death. Glenn Close plays a 40-year-old woman who as a child received some convent education but is ultimately an abandoned orphan. Having been attacked by the older children, presumably raped she ultimately assumes the character of a man Albert Nobbs. As Albert she becomes a waiter, finding that this way she can receive the higher pay normally granted to men and gain the slight protection of a male persona. Hard work has enabled Albert to amass just enough money to dream of opening a tobacconist shop. Having lived in a world tightly inside her head Albert dreams of adding a companion to her life. We do not know if she admits to any sexual identity which is to say this is not a movie about sex or lesbianism.Glenn close portrays her character brilliantly. Employing makeup that does nothing to soften what being a 40-year-old working person might look like, she is only allowed changes in facial expressions to portray her character's inner life. Because of what is a very strictly hierarchical world almost every character in this movie is restricted in when, where and how they can express themselves. Consequently much of this movie is expressed with the same technique.This is not a chick flick, a movie about the difficulties of being gay or lesbian, or merely a character study of how life was hard 175 years ago in Ireland. Consider what Ireland looked like 175 years ago. It was intensely Catholic, deeply divided along class lines, and consequently power flowed, often with a heavy hand, downward.I've not seen it suggested elsewhere but I propose the following describes this very deliberately paced movie.This movie is a tragedy. Albert Nobbs is one of life's victims. Hard, dedicated and loyal work combined with an extremely minimalist lifestyle has allowed her to accumulate money. She is very close to her goal of achieving some kind of independence. What is immediately obvious to the maid she attempts to court, is that the location Albert has chosen for her shop is poorly located. Consequently it will not support Albert's dream future. That is Albert's hard work and consistent saving, her life of sacrifice in favor of her dream, will end badly.One of the themes introduced very early in this movie is the notion that a character who has any power over another will abuse that power. People can be fired for any reason, including jealousy or merely to please a passing if influential customer. In Albert's personal history older children abused her because they can. Even her employer, Ms. Baker, mostly a nice person is more feared than respected by her hotel staff. Throughout this movie it is clear that in a world where there is no enforcement of the concept of human dignity, there will be no recognition of human value.This is a world with ""prayer in school"", everyone considers themselves a good Christian, and government is almost nonexistent. A typhus outbreak will cause the hotel to be placed in quarantine. This is the only appearance of government, and the only substantial use of power for good.  No one in this world has union protection. No one would think of suing anyone. It is assumed that the more powerful may exert power in an arbitrary and capricious manner.In the world of Albert Nobbs, companionship is necessary as much to support survival as to serve any human need, sexual or otherwise. A lover, a spouse, or any person with whom you can share intimacy represents the only person who was likely to recognize your value as a human being.Clearly this is not an action movie or a light entertainment. If you are looking for background noise while you are doing other things or just an excuse to eat popcorn this is not your movie. If you have a couple hours to seriously think about what the world might look like if you are 100% self- dependent Albert Nobbs may help guide your thinking",5,Glen Close tour de force acting and a many layered story,1358553600,"01 19, 2013",2013,3974,"['First', 'plot', 'movie', 'Albert', 'Nobbs', 'set', '19', 'century', 'Ireland', 'time', 'place', 'poverty', 'meant', 'misery', 'usually', 'bad', 'death', 'Glenn', 'Close', '40-year-old', 'woman', 'who', 'child', 'received', 'convent', 'education', 'ultimately', 'abandoned', 'orphan', 'Having', 'been', 'attacked', 'older', 'children', 'presumably', 'raped', 'ultimately', 'character', 'man', 'Albert', 'Nobbs', 'Albert', 'waiter', 'finding', 'way', 'can', 'receive', 'higher', 'pay', 'normally', 'granted', 'men', 'gain', 'slight', 'protection', 'male', 'persona', 'Hard', 'work', 'enabled', 'Albert', 'amass', 'just', 'enough', 'money', 'dream', 'opening', 'tobacconist', 'shop', 'Having', 'lived', 'world', 'tightly', 'head', 'Albert', 'dreams', 'adding', 'companion', 'life', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'sexual', 'identity', 'say', 'not', 'movie', 'sex', 'lesbianism.Glenn', 'close', 'character', 'brilliantly', 'Employing', 'makeup', 'nothing', 'soften', 'what', 'being', '40-year-old', 'working', 'person', 'might', 'look', 'only', 'allowed', 'changes', 'facial', 'expressions', 'portray', 'character', 'inner', 'life', 'what', 'very', 'strictly', 'hierarchical', 'world', 'almost', 'character', 'movie', 'restricted', 'when', 'where', 'how', 'can', 'express', 'Consequently', 'much', 'movie', 'expressed', 'same', 'technique.This', 'not', 'chick', 'flick', 'movie', 'difficulties', 'being', 'gay', 'lesbian', 'merely', 'character', 'study', 'how', 'life', 'was', 'hard', '175', 'years', 'ago', 'Ireland', 'Consider', 'what', 'Ireland', 'looked', '175', 'years', 'ago', 'was', 'intensely', 'Catholic', 'deeply', 'divided', 'class', 'lines', 'consequently', 'power', 'flowed', 'often', 'heavy', 'hand', 'downward.I', ""'ve"", 'not', 'seen', 'suggested', 'elsewhere', 'propose', 'following', 'describes', 'very', 'deliberately', 'paced', 'movie.This', 'movie', 'tragedy', 'Albert', 'Nobbs', 'one', 'life', 'victims', 'Hard', 'dedicated', 'loyal', 'work', 'combined', 'extremely', 'minimalist', 'lifestyle', 'allowed', 'accumulate', 'money', 'very', 'close', 'goal', 'achieving', 'kind', 'independence', 'What', 'immediately', 'obvious', 'maid', 'court', 'location', 'Albert', 'chosen', 'shop', 'poorly', 'located', 'Consequently', 'will', 'not', 'support', 'Albert', 'dream', 'future', 'Albert', 'hard', 'work', 'consistent', 'saving', 'life', 'sacrifice', 'favor', 'dream', 'will', 'end', 'badly.One', 'themes', 'introduced', 'very', 'early', 'movie', 'notion', 'character', 'who', 'power', 'will', 'abuse', 'power', 'People', 'can', 'be', 'fired', 'reason', 'including', 'jealousy', 'merely', 'please', 'passing', 'influential', 'customer', 'Albert', 'personal', 'history', 'older', 'children', 'abused', 'can', 'Even', 'employer', 'Ms.', 'Baker', 'mostly', 'nice', 'person', 'more', 'feared', 'respected', 'hotel', 'staff', 'movie', 'clear', 'world', 'where', 'enforcement', 'concept', 'human', 'dignity', 'will', 'be', 'recognition', 'human', 'value.This', 'world', 'prayer', 'school', 'everyone', 'considers', 'good', 'Christian', 'government', 'almost', 'nonexistent', 'typhus', 'outbreak', 'will', 'cause', 'hotel', 'be', 'placed', 'quarantine', 'only', 'appearance', 'government', 'only', 'substantial', 'use', 'power', 'good', 'one', 'world', 'union', 'protection', 'one', 'would', 'think', 'suing', 'anyone', 'assumed', 'more', 'powerful', 'may', 'exert', 'power', 'arbitrary', 'capricious', 'manner.In', 'world', 'Albert', 'Nobbs', 'companionship', 'necessary', 'as', 'much', 'support', 'survival', 'serve', 'human', 'need', 'sexual', 'otherwise', 'lover', 'spouse', 'person', 'whom', 'can', 'share', 'intimacy', 'only', 'person', 'who', 'was', 'likely', 'recognize', 'value', 'human', 'being.Clearly', 'not', 'action', 'movie', 'light', 'entertainment', 'are', 'looking', 'background', 'noise', 'are', 'doing', 'other', 'things', 'just', 'excuse', 'eat', 'popcorn', 'not', 'movie', 'have', 'couple', 'hours', 'seriously', 'think', 'what', 'world', 'might', 'look', 'are', '100', '%', 'self-', 'dependent', 'Albert', 'Nobbs', 'may', 'help', 'guide', 'thinking']",Albert Nobbs

I've always been a fan of Glenn Close, and was pleased she finally got some Oscar recognition after all these years. After a long hiatus from film, concentrating on theatre endeavors 'n stuff, she's back with aplomb.The first thing that was marketed was the gender-bending character of dear Albert. This is NOT a gay film. Glenn Close's miniscule Albert is sweet and lonely, and knows it's a man's world. Posing as a waiter in a posh Irish establishment is the only way to survive in a man's world. A revelation happens when Albert meets a painter who's been thrust into the same lifestyle (the magnificent Janet McTeer). Revelations abound, subtly, and Albert is aware that there might be happiness. 'Nuff said. Albert makes some bold choices, none of which is good, but discovers that life isn't always fair.Sound familiar? Not really. There's so much sensitivity and renewal in Albert's bleak life that makes you cheer, for a moment.

Her alter-ego, a nasty Aaron Johnson, causes issues that may get in the way of Albert's plans. Love survives...but not really.Without giving anything away, I was totally committed to the narrative being presented. This is an Indie film, presented with impeccable period detail. Excellent support from Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, Pauline Collins, Brendan Gleeson and Brenda Fricker add to an overall perfect cast.References have been made to ""Boys Don't Cry"", though the play was written many years before.

1529871,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B007CEFTSA,RMurray847,"[3, 7]","Apparently bringing ALBERT NOBBS to the screen was a major passion for star Glenn Close. Having seen the film, it is hard to understand why. The central character is a curiosity at best, a cipher at worst. While always modestly interesting, the film is not emotionally captivating nor does it really make a point that has much relevancy today.NOBBS is set in 19th century Dublin, at Morrison's Hotel, a nearly upscale place. We meet the various staff members who work there, in particular the peculiar looking, diminutive waiter Albert Nobbs. Early on, we discover that Nobbs is a woman disguising herself as a man, and that she lives virtually every day in near constant terror of discovery...which would lead to ridicule and loss of employment. The rest of the staff has known Nobbs forever and is generally kindly disposed to this meek little ""man.""One day, Albert's world is rocked when he's forced by his boss to share his modest bed with a burly house painter who has been doing some work around the hotel. And it comes to pass that Albert is discovered and reduced to blubbering, pleading pile. So the painter reveals that he too is actually a woman (Janet McTeer...in a blistering performance that makes seeing the film worthwhile). The monumental nature of this coincidence made me wonder if women disguised as men was just incredibly commonplace in 19th century Dublin, or if the screenwriters just thought we would accept this wild coincidence on which the entire film turns as a matter-of-fact occurrence. I had to accept it, of course...but it was momentarily laughable at best.Anyway, Nobbs becomes obsessed with the life this painter leads...""he"" is married to a seamstress with whom a home is shared and apparently a comfortable life. Albert, who has always dreamed of owning a shop of some sort, decides that he will emulate this lifestyle and find ""himself"" a wife. He begins to court a maid (Mia Wasikowska, from ALICE IN WONDERLAND and THE KIDS ARE ALRIGHT...but quite wan and unlikeable here) from the hotel.Various misunderstands ensue, some mildly humorous and many quite serious. Albert doesn't understand the human heart and human desire very well (nor does he appear to understand real estate values or how much of the world works), and this gets him into one perplexing (for him) situation after another.I supposed one could argue that the film is about the need to be who one is, rather than pretend to be someone else. Or how society can crush us when we can't just be who we are. Or something like that. But the society of the film is so removed from ours; it is hard to draw parallels. Yes, gay couples are not currently allowed to marry, for example...but to draw a line from this circumstance to those of the characters in this film is too much of a stretch. And Albert Nobbs is such an odd, otherworldly character that it's very difficult to say he/she is much like anyone we'd meet today.Around this strange character, some interesting plot developments occur and there are some nice performances, especially the stellar McTeer, Pauline Collins (SHIRLEY VALENTINE) as the hotel proprietress and in a small role, the always welcome Brendan Gleeson...who after his work in THE GUARD this year, which the Oscars again ignored, I must call the most underrated actor in film today. Aaron Johnson (NOWHERE BOY, KICK-A*S) appears in a critical role and continues to have interesting charisma. But Glenn Close (perplexingly nominated for an Oscar) just doesn't convince while playing a character that isn't really believable. COULD the events of this film have happened? Absolutely. But the movie brings no urgency, no REASON for having been made. Thus, while I admired many smaller elements of the movie, I can ultimately only give it the most lukewarm of recommendations.",3,A very mixed bag,1331510400,"03 12, 2012",2012,3800,"['Apparently', 'bringing', 'ALBERT', 'NOBBS', 'screen', 'was', 'major', 'passion', 'star', 'Glenn', 'Close', 'Having', 'seen', 'film', 'hard', 'understand', 'why', 'central', 'character', 'curiosity', 'best', 'cipher', 'worst', 'always', 'modestly', 'interesting', 'film', 'not', 'emotionally', 'captivating', 'really', 'make', 'point', 'much', 'relevancy', 'today.NOBBS', 'set', '19th', 'century', 'Dublin', 'Morrison', 'Hotel', 'nearly', 'upscale', 'place', 'meet', 'various', 'staff', 'members', 'who', 'work', 'there', 'particular', 'peculiar', 'looking', 'diminutive', 'waiter', 'Albert', 'Nobbs', 'Early', 'discover', 'Nobbs', 'woman', 'disguising', 'man', 'virtually', 'day', 'near', 'constant', 'terror', 'discovery', 'would', 'lead', 'ridicule', 'loss', 'employment', 'rest', 'staff', 'known', 'Nobbs', 'forever', 'generally', 'kindly', 'disposed', 'meek', 'little', 'man', 'One', 'day', 'Albert', 'world', 'rocked', 'when', 'forced', 'boss', 'share', 'modest', 'bed', 'burly', 'house', 'painter', 'who', 'been', 'doing', 'work', 'hotel', 'pass', 'Albert', 'discovered', 'reduced', 'blubbering', 'pleading', 'pile', 'painter', 'reveals', 'too', 'actually', 'woman', 'Janet', 'McTeer', 'blistering', 'performance', 'seeing', 'film', 'worthwhile', 'monumental', 'nature', 'coincidence', 'made', 'wonder', 'women', 'disguised', 'men', 'was', 'just', 'incredibly', 'commonplace', '19th', 'century', 'Dublin', 'screenwriters', 'just', 'thought', 'would', 'accept', 'wild', 'coincidence', 'entire', 'film', 'matter-of-fact', 'occurrence', 'had', 'accept', 'course', 'was', 'momentarily', 'laughable', 'best.Anyway', 'Nobbs', 'obsessed', 'life', 'painter', 'married', 'seamstress', 'whom', 'home', 'shared', 'apparently', 'comfortable', 'life', 'Albert', 'who', 'always', 'dreamed', 'owning', 'shop', 'sort', 'will', 'emulate', 'lifestyle', 'find', 'wife', 'court', 'maid', 'Mia', 'Wasikowska', 'ALICE', 'IN', 'WONDERLAND', 'THE', 'KIDS', 'ARE', 'ALRIGHT', 'quite', 'wan', 'unlikeable', 'here', 'hotel.Various', 'misunderstands', 'ensue', 'mildly', 'humorous', 'many', 'quite', 'serious', 'Albert', ""n't"", 'understand', 'human', 'heart', 'human', 'desire', 'very', 'well', 'appear', 'understand', 'real', 'estate', 'values', 'how', 'much', 'world', 'one', 'perplexing', 'situation', 'another.I', 'supposed', 'one', 'could', 'argue', 'film', 'need', 'be', 'who', 'one', 'rather', 'pretend', 'be', 'someone', 'else', 'how', 'society', 'can', 'crush', 'when', 'ca', ""n't"", 'just', 'be', 'who', 'are', 'something', 'society', 'film', 'so', 'removed', 'ours', 'hard', 'draw', 'parallels', 'Yes', 'gay', 'couples', 'are', 'not', 'currently', 'allowed', 'marry', 'example', 'draw', 'line', 'circumstance', 'characters', 'film', 'too', 'much', 'stretch', 'Albert', 'Nobbs', 'such', 'odd', 'otherworldly', 'character', 'very', 'difficult', 'say', 'he/she', 'much', 'anyone', ""'d"", 'meet', 'strange', 'character', 'interesting', 'plot', 'developments', 'occur', 'are', 'nice', 'performances', 'especially', 'stellar', 'McTeer', 'Pauline', 'Collins', 'SHIRLEY', 'VALENTINE', 'hotel', 'proprietress', 'small', 'role', 'always', 'welcome', 'Brendan', 'Gleeson', 'who', 'work', 'GUARD', 'year', 'Oscars', 'again', 'ignored', 'must', 'call', 'most', 'underrated', 'actor', 'film', 'today', 'Aaron', 'Johnson', 'NOWHERE', 'BOY', 'KICK-A*S', 'critical', 'role', 'have', 'interesting', 'charisma', 'Glenn', 'Close', 'perplexingly', 'nominated', 'Oscar', 'just', ""n't"", 'convince', 'playing', 'character', ""n't"", 'really', 'believable', 'COULD', 'events', 'film', 'have', 'happened', 'Absolutely', 'movie', 'urgency', 'REASON', 'having', 'been', 'made', 'Thus', 'admired', 'many', 'smaller', 'elements', 'movie', 'can', 'ultimately', 'only', 'give', 'most', 'lukewarm', 'recommendations']",Albert Nobbs

The film is about a woman who passes as a man for decades as a form of self-preservation. Albert Nobbs is a waiter in a hotel frequented by wealthy patrons which boasts a well-mannered staff. One day a painter is procured to freshen up a room, and the hotel owner assigns him to share a bed with Albert. He is beside himself with worry that he will be found out as a woman, and indeed he is, but the painter does not reveal his secret and instead leaves him with some hope for his future. Over the years, Albert has saved a good amount of money in hopes of buying a shop, and his conversation with the painter makes his dream all the more urgent. Meanwhile a maid begins a relationship with a brash young man with dreams of going to America and Albert attempts to save her from his lusts.It is a wonder that a movie so subtle with such a creeping pace could bring about such an emotional wallop, but it is masterfully crafted. The restraints of the time period force the characters to never fully express what they feel and their ache is imparted on the viewer. Glenn Close is perfect for the part of Albert; this is the part she was born to play. She was shrewd at acknowledging the story's potential for the screen and helped write the screenplay.

1529876,A3RNP5X8ZGZIEI,B007CEFTSA,Stephanie De Pue,"[1, 1]","""Albert Nobbs""a much-honored 2011 social issue drama of 113 minutes is set in late 19th century Dublin, Ireland.  It tells the tale of the little man who never was.  ""Albert Nobbs"" is a waiter in a pricey hotel in late Victorian times.  His customers see him as a kind, fussy little man, but he's not.  He's a woman living as a man because the male waiters make much more money than the women maids, and can hope even to be able to save enough so as to retire to a little shop of some sort - Albert thinks a tobacconist for him.  And waiters don't have to beat laundry in the cold and snow, as the maids must. The movie is based upon a novella by Irish author George Moore.  Its title role is played by Glenn Close, an Oscar winner for (The World According to Garp), giving a ""powerhouse performance"" here according to the New York Post.  Close recreates her 1982 stage role here; I understand it took her all the intervening decades to manage to get this work filmed.  At any rate, she was also nominated for a Best Actress Oscar for her work in this film.Nobbs has spent decades working as a man, and is reaching the point where he thinks he can see the light at the end of the tunnel, though he is not sure how to strategize it.  He's biding his time.  Then two men arrive at the hotel at roughly the same time.  Handsome strapping handyman Joe Machin, played by Aaron Johnson,Nowhere Boy.  And handsome swaggering housepainter Hubert Page, played by esteemed actress, Janet McTeer, (Tumbleweeds), also passing as a man, and also Oscar nominated as Best Supporting Actress for her work here. Nobbs and the painter share their secrets, and Nobbs discovers that the latter is married to a lively, wage-earning seamstress.  The waiter gets ideas: perhaps there might be a wife in his future too.  Unfortunately, he turns his attention to the flighty hotel maid Helen Dawes, played by independent film darling Mia Wasikowska,Alice in Wonderland,Jane Eyre.  But Helen is much taken by, and then pregnant by, Joe.Machin. However, Machin urges her to string Nobbs along, as there must be much-needed money somewhere in Nobbs' vicinity.  Suddenly we see Nobbs' tender side.  But he is jeopardizing himself, and we suspect things will not end well for him.There's loads of highly prestigious international talent in front of and behind the camera in this outstanding indie production.  The screenplay was written by Close, and Booker Award winning Irish author John Banville (The Sea).  Direction is by Rodrigo Garcia, (MOTHER AND CHILD)who does specialize in female-centric scenarios.  And, in front of the camera, my, oh my.  So many Oscar nominees/winners, once very popular/popular now.  That hunk Jonathan Rhys Meyers (The Tudors: The Complete Series) as Viscount Yarrell.  Pauline Collins, long-ago flavor of the month forUpstairs, Downstairs: The Complete Series - 40th Anniversary Collection,Shirley Valentine, as Mrs. Margaret `Madge' Baker, owner of the hotel.  Brenda Fricker, Oscar winner forMy Left Foot, as Polly, the cook.  Brendan Gleeson (IN BRUGES) as Dr. Halloran.  Phyllida Law ( RUMPOLE OF THE BAILEY) as Mrs. Cavendish.  Maria Doyle Kennedy (DOWNTON ABBEY, THE TUDORS) as Mary, a maid. Bronagh Gallagher as Cathleen, Hugh's wife.  Angeline Ball as Mrs. Gilligan.  And the latter three women, folks, were the three girl backup singers in THE COMMITMENTS, here together again.The production comes off as a little stagey; still, I thought it did an excellent job of giving us Dublin, as it might have appeared then, in its seasons, snow-bound winter, blooming spring, and reflective fall.  We are never given any clue as to Nobbs' actual sexual orientation; he comes off as asexual, rather closed-off, and hard to warm to.  I saw a production of this as a play in Trinity College, Dublin, in 1980, and believe the treatment I saw made more explicit the fact that Nobbs spent his/her entire adult life with her breasts bound, passing for a man, out of economic necessity.  I do wish the film had underlined its economic underpinnings more.  Still, it's there, between the lines in many scenes: a powerful and memorable message.",4,The Little Man Who Never Was,1347580800,"09 14, 2012",2012,4139,"['Albert', 'Nobbs', 'much-honored', '2011', 'social', 'issue', 'drama', '113', 'minutes', 'set', 'late', '19th', 'century', 'Dublin', 'Ireland', 'tale', 'little', 'man', 'who', 'never', 'was', 'Albert', 'Nobbs', 'waiter', 'pricey', 'hotel', 'late', 'Victorian', 'times', 'customers', 'see', 'kind', 'fussy', 'little', 'man', 'not', 'woman', 'living', 'man', 'male', 'waiters', 'make', 'much', 'more', 'money', 'women', 'maids', 'can', 'hope', 'even', 'be', 'able', 'save', 'enough', 'so', 'retire', 'little', 'shop', 'sort', 'Albert', 'tobacconist', 'waiters', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'beat', 'laundry', 'cold', 'snow', 'maids', 'must', 'movie', 'based', 'novella', 'Irish', 'author', 'George', 'Moore', 'title', 'role', 'played', 'Glenn', 'Close', 'Oscar', 'winner', 'World', 'According', 'Garp', 'giving', 'powerhouse', 'performance', 'here', 'according', 'New', 'York', 'Post', 'Close', '1982', 'stage', 'role', 'here', 'understand', 'took', 'intervening', 'decades', 'manage', 'get', 'work', 'filmed', 'rate', 'was', 'also', 'nominated', 'Best', 'Actress', 'Oscar', 'work', 'film.Nobbs', 'spent', 'decades', 'working', 'man', 'reaching', 'point', 'where', 'can', 'see', 'light', 'end', 'tunnel', 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'strategize', 'biding', 'time', 'Then', 'two', 'men', 'arrive', 'hotel', 'roughly', 'same', 'time', 'Handsome', 'strapping', 'handyman', 'Joe', 'Machin', 'played', 'Aaron', 'Johnson', 'Nowhere', 'Boy', 'handsome', 'swaggering', 'housepainter', 'Hubert', 'Page', 'played', 'esteemed', 'actress', 'Janet', 'McTeer', 'Tumbleweeds', 'also', 'passing', 'man', 'also', 'Oscar', 'nominated', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actress', 'work', 'here', 'Nobbs', 'painter', 'share', 'secrets', 'Nobbs', 'discovers', 'latter', 'married', 'lively', 'wage-earning', 'seamstress', 'waiter', 'ideas', 'perhaps', 'might', 'be', 'wife', 'future', 'too', 'Unfortunately', 'attention', 'flighty', 'hotel', 'maid', 'Helen', 'Dawes', 'played', 'independent', 'film', 'darling', 'Mia', 'Wasikowska', 'Alice', 'Wonderland', 'Jane', 'Eyre', 'Helen', 'much', 'taken', 'then', 'pregnant', 'Joe.Machin', 'However', 'Machin', 'string', 'Nobbs', 'along', 'must', 'be', 'much-needed', 'money', 'somewhere', 'Nobbs', 'vicinity', 'Suddenly', 'see', 'Nobbs', 'tender', 'side', 'jeopardizing', 'suspect', 'things', 'will', 'not', 'end', 'well', 'him.There', 'loads', 'highly', 'prestigious', 'international', 'talent', 'front', 'camera', 'outstanding', 'indie', 'production', 'screenplay', 'was', 'written', 'Close', 'Booker', 'Award', 'winning', 'Irish', 'author', 'John', 'Banville', 'Sea', 'Direction', 'Rodrigo', 'Garcia', 'MOTHER', 'AND', 'CHILD', 'who', 'specialize', 'female-centric', 'scenarios', 'front', 'camera', 'oh', 'So', 'many', 'Oscar', 'nominees/winners', 'once', 'very', 'popular/popular', 'now', 'hunk', 'Jonathan', 'Rhys', 'Meyers', 'Tudors', 'Complete', 'Series', 'Viscount', 'Yarrell', 'Pauline', 'Collins', 'long-ago', 'flavor', 'month', 'forUpstairs', 'Downstairs', 'Complete', 'Series', '40th', 'Anniversary', 'Collection', 'Shirley', 'Valentine', 'Mrs.', 'Margaret', 'Madge', 'Baker', 'owner', 'hotel', 'Brenda', 'Fricker', 'Oscar', 'winner', 'forMy', 'Left', 'Foot', 'Polly', 'cook', 'Brendan', 'Gleeson', 'IN', 'BRUGES', 'Dr.', 'Halloran', 'Phyllida', 'Law', 'RUMPOLE', 'THE', 'BAILEY', 'Mrs.', 'Cavendish', 'Maria', 'Doyle', 'Kennedy', 'DOWNTON', 'ABBEY', 'THE', 'TUDORS', 'Mary', 'maid', 'Bronagh', 'Gallagher', 'Cathleen', 'Hugh', 'wife', 'Angeline', 'Ball', 'Mrs.', 'Gilligan', 'latter', 'three', 'women', 'folks', 'were', 'three', 'girl', 'backup', 'singers', 'COMMITMENTS', 'here', 'together', 'again.The', 'production', 'off', 'little', 'stagey', 'still', 'thought', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'giving', 'Dublin', 'might', 'have', 'appeared', 'then', 'seasons', 'snow-bound', 'winter', 'blooming', 'spring', 'reflective', 'fall', 'are', 'never', 'given', 'clue', 'Nobbs', 'actual', 'sexual', 'orientation', 'off', 'asexual', 'rather', 'closed-off', 'hard', 'warm', 'saw', 'production', 'play', 'Trinity', 'College', 'Dublin', '1980', 'believe', 'treatment', 'saw', 'made', 'more', 'explicit', 'fact', 'Nobbs', 'spent', 'entire', 'adult', 'life', 'breasts', 'bound', 'passing', 'man', 'economic', 'necessity', 'do', 'wish', 'film', 'had', 'underlined', 'economic', 'underpinnings', 'more', 'Still', 'there', 'lines', 'many', 'scenes', 'powerful', 'memorable', 'message']",Albert Nobbs

It's an amazingly depressing story, but one that you have to see through to the end. There is so much going on that is just so interesting: the lifestyles of the working class, peaking in on the nasty rich, human relationships, and Dublin history and culture. The costumes and settings added a lot to the story without ever been pretentious or overdone. Although Close doesn't speak very much throughout the entire movie, she manages to convey so much- especially in the beach scene near the end.I wouldn't classify this as a ""gay"" movie. It's a human movie. If you like a good story that doesn't rely on nudity, explosions, or violence, you will enjoy it.If you are interested in it for Jonathan Rhys Meyers, skip it. He is on screen for only a few minutes and has only a few lines. The movie isn't the worse for that, but it looks like he ""stars.""

Albert (Close) works as a waiter in one of Ireland's most impressive and upper-class hotels. He has been saving his money for years in hopes of starting a new life. When a painter shows up he begins a friendship with him that starts to allow him to be confident in ending the lie he has been living. Albert his a woman. I have to admit I was almost dreading watching this movie. I am not a fan of any of the PBS type British movies or any of the Jane Austin type movies. From the preview this is what I was expecting. While it did have the feel of a movie like that I was completely sucked in and blown away by this movie. Glenn Close is absolutely wonderful in this movie and I am not sure how she didn't win the Oscar. This is a movie that is not for everyone but take it from me and give it a chance. You will love it as much as I did. The movie almost left me speechless by its beauty. This is not usually my type of movie at all but I loved it. Overall, a movie that deserves to be watched by more of an audience then it will get. I surprisingly give it an A+",5,This is not usually my type of movie. I didn't want to really watch it.

1529882,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B007CEFTSA,Tsuyoshi,"[0, 0]","Albert Nobbs is a perfect waiter of Morrison's Hotel in 19th century Dublin. He is quiet, quick to provide what the guests want, and never complains. Albert has been working here for thirty years. And Albert has a big secret.Hubert Page is a painter hired by the hotel&#8217;s greedy owner Mrs. Baker. One night Hubert discovers the secret that Albert has been hiding for a long time. Actually, Hubert also has a secret to hide from the world, just like Albert.I do not write about what kind of secrets they are to share, even though it is not hard to guess for most viewers. The point is not the secrets themselves, but the way Albert changes after meeting Hubert. Albert takes a step towards his dream with the money he has been saving &#8211; his awkward courtship with the hotel&#8217;s maid Helen Dawes (Mia Wasikowska).I hate to say this, knowing that the film is Glenn Close&#8217;s labor-of-love, but, for all the great acting from the stars (Glenn Close and Janet McTeer are both nominated for Oscar), the protagonist&#8217;s story feels far too understated, much less interesting than that of Hubert, who brings much needed humor and emotion to counteract director Rodrigo Garc&iacute;a&#8217;s slow-paced narrative. The production design recreating the interiors of a 19th century hotel is impressive, but most supporting characters played by gifted players only serve to highlight the story of Albert, who could have been more intriguing.&#8220;Albert Nobbs&#8221; is a passion project of the star Glenn Close, who played the role in a 1982 Off Broadway stage production by a French playwright Simone Benmussa that is based on a 1918 George Moore novella (in which the role of Hubert is much smaller). For the film version Glenn Close not only stars, but co-writes the script with Gabriella Prekop, long-time script consultant of a respected Hungarian director Istv&aacute;n Szab&oacute; (with whom Glenn Close worked in &#8220;Meeting Venus&#8221;) and John Banville, a 2005 Booker Prize winner.Not surprisingly, &#8220;Albert Nobbs&#8221; is an intelligent and thought-provoking period drama, but somehow its premise, unique as it is, overshadows the story that should be more involving.",3,Meeting Albert Nobbs,1360972800,"02 16, 2013",2013,2201,"['Albert', 'Nobbs', 'perfect', 'waiter', 'Morrison', 'Hotel', '19th', 'century', 'Dublin', 'quiet', 'quick', 'provide', 'what', 'guests', 'want', 'never', 'complains', 'Albert', 'been', 'working', 'here', 'thirty', 'years', 'Albert', 'big', 'secret.Hubert', 'Page', 'painter', 'hired', 'hotel', '8217', 'greedy', 'owner', 'Mrs.', 'Baker', 'One', 'night', 'Hubert', 'secret', 'Albert', 'been', 'hiding', 'long', 'time', 'Actually', 'Hubert', 'also', 'secret', 'hide', 'world', 'just', 'Albert.I', 'do', 'not', 'write', 'what', 'kind', 'secrets', 'are', 'share', 'even', 'not', 'hard', 'guess', 'most', 'viewers', 'point', 'not', 'secrets', 'way', 'Albert', 'changes', 'meeting', 'Hubert', 'Albert', 'step', 'dream', 'money', 'been', 'saving', '8211', 'awkward', 'courtship', 'hotel', '8217', 'maid', 'Helen', 'Dawes', 'Mia', 'Wasikowska', '.I', 'hate', 'say', 'knowing', 'film', 'Glenn', 'Close', '8217', 's', 'labor-of-love', 'great', 'acting', 'stars', 'Glenn', 'Close', 'Janet', 'McTeer', 'are', 'nominated', 'Oscar', 'protagonist', '8217', 'story', 'feels', 'far', 'too', 'understated', 'much', 'less', 'interesting', 'Hubert', 'who', 'much', 'needed', 'humor', 'emotion', 'counteract', 'director', 'Rodrigo', 'Garc', 'iacute', '8217', 'slow-paced', 'narrative', 'production', 'design', 'recreating', 'interiors', '19th', 'century', 'hotel', 'impressive', 'most', 'supporting', 'characters', 'played', 'gifted', 'players', 'only', 'serve', 'highlight', 'story', 'Albert', 'who', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'intriguing.', '8220', 'Albert', 'Nobbs', '8221', 'passion', 'project', 'star', 'Glenn', 'Close', 'who', 'played', 'role', '1982', 'Off', 'Broadway', 'stage', 'production', 'French', 'playwright', 'Simone', 'Benmussa', 'based', '1918', 'George', 'Moore', 'novella', 'role', 'Hubert', 'much', 'smaller', 'film', 'version', 'Glenn', 'Close', 'not', 'only', 'script', 'Gabriella', 'Prekop', 'long-time', 'script', 'consultant', 'respected', 'Hungarian', 'director', 'Istv', 'aacute', 'Szab', 'oacute', 'whom', 'Glenn', 'Close', 'worked', '8220', 'Meeting', 'Venus', '8221', 'John', 'Banville', '2005', 'Booker', 'Prize', 'winner.Not', 'surprisingly', '8220', 'Albert', 'Nobbs', '8221', 'intelligent', 'thought-provoking', 'period', 'drama', 'somehow', 'premise', 'unique', 'story', 'should', 'be', 'more', 'involving']",Albert Nobbs
