867162,A374OO1EAUZASC,B0006GAO54,2201,"[13, 16]","Angel, as a show, pretty much lost me in season four (see my less than enthusiastic review of that one for details.)  Season 5, however, won back my heart.The introduction of Spike was done so well that it shouldn't be considered ""jumping the shark.""  All the hows & whys of his post-post mortem reappearance were answered in such a way that it actually strengthened the season-long arc.  They could have very easily just said ""oooh, it was magic"" but they didn't.  The writers carefully wrote a back story and even brought back Mr. Urban Cowboy himself (Lindsey) and even suggested that W&H; wanted Angel (not Spike) to die in the hellmouth and then be connected to W&H...but; Buffy unwittingly threw a monkey wrench in those plans.The first part of the season mainly deals with creatrues-of-the-week, most of whom are W&H; clients, and the Angel Gang's transistion from their previous roles to their new one, that of working for good inside the belly of the beast.  The Angel/Spike rivalry is also explored in more depth, with ""Destiny"" being one of the best episodes in the history of the Buffyverse.  Another episode, ""Damage,"" explores the consequences of Buffy's actions at the end of that series in a tasteful yet disturbing manner.The season, and the show, really turned a corner with the 100th episode ""You're Welcome"" where Cordelia made a triumphant but brief return.  She was the true Cordy from season 3, not the vacuous and superficial teenager from Buffy nor the pawn of evil from Angel Season 4.  Her one appearance really helped direct the rest of the season towards its final conclusion, and the ending scene brought tears to my (usually unemotional) eyes.After that point, there is a little comic element, including a flashback to WWII with spike wearing a Nazi jacket (he wasn't a Nazi, he'd just eaten one and liked the jacket) and one of the most darkly humorous episodes in the history of television, ""Smile Time"" where Angel gets turned into a puppet.  The scenes where Nina the Werewolf attacks puppet Angel was absolutely hilarious and the one where puppet-Angel vamps out during a fight scene had me in stitches.After the humor comes turmoil, as we must bid farewell to Fred.  I don't know of any fan of the series who did not love Fred, and her death and subsequent metamorphosis into Illyria caused as much anguish amongst fans as it did amongst the characters.  Her death seemed to simultaneously eliminate the hope of a happy ending, while at the same time emphasize that the fight must go on.Towards the end of the season, the weekly plotlines are supplemented by subtle yet powerful indications that something big is about to go down.  Angel appears to become desensitized to evil (at least) or becoming a part of evil (at worst.)  The characters must come to terms with their actions and decisions over the past few years.In the midst of this, Connor returns.  Only he's not the annoying brat from a hell dimension he once was.  Now he's a normal, intelligent young man who still can't escape his destiny.  This year's Connor was actually more likable and quite a bit more attractive) when compared to the previous years.Probably the only non-great episode is the third to last, ""The Girl In Question"" when Angel & Spike go to Rome to save Buffy from and old enemy of theirs.  It just didn't work well, but the secondary plot with Illyria reverting to ""the Burkle persona"" was dark & disturbing.  What saves the episode are the flashback scenes, particularly when Drusilla & Darla go to take a bath together and Drusilla says ""is it time for another pony ride?""Character development was great in season 5.  Not a single member of the group remained unchanged (in the case of Fred, quite literally) but yet they stayed true to their core values and to fighting the good fight.The last two episodes were quite simply orgasmic.  Enough said.Favorite episodes: Destiny, Damage, You're Welcome, Smile Time, Not Fade Away.Most emotional: Destiny, A Hole in the World, Shells.Funniest episodes: Smile Time, The Girl in Question.",5,Season five won me back to the Angel fold,1099612800,"11 5, 2004",2004,4055,"['Angel', 'show', 'pretty', 'much', 'lost', 'season', 'four', 'see', 'less', 'enthusiastic', 'review', 'one', 'details', 'Season', '5', 'however', 'won', 'back', 'heart.The', 'introduction', 'Spike', 'was', 'done', 'so', 'well', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'considered', 'jumping', 'shark', 'hows', 'whys', 'post-post', 'mortem', 'reappearance', 'were', 'answered', 'such', 'way', 'actually', 'strengthened', 'season-long', 'arc', 'could', 'have', 'very', 'easily', 'just', 'said', 'oooh', 'was', 'magic', 'did', ""n't"", 'writers', 'carefully', 'wrote', 'back', 'story', 'even', 'brought', 'back', 'Mr.', 'Urban', 'Cowboy', 'Lindsey', 'even', 'suggested', 'W', 'H', 'wanted', 'Angel', 'not', 'Spike', 'die', 'hellmouth', 'then', 'be', 'connected', 'W', 'H', 'Buffy', 'unwittingly', 'threw', 'monkey', 'wrench', 'plans.The', 'first', 'part', 'season', 'mainly', 'creatrues-of-the-week', 'most', 'whom', 'are', 'W', 'H', 'clients', 'Angel', 'Gang', 'transistion', 'previous', 'roles', 'new', 'one', 'working', 'good', 'belly', 'beast', 'Angel/Spike', 'rivalry', 'also', 'explored', 'more', 'depth', 'Destiny', 'being', 'one', 'best', 'episodes', 'history', 'Buffyverse', 'episode', 'Damage', 'consequences', 'Buffy', 'actions', 'end', 'series', 'tasteful', 'yet', 'disturbing', 'manner.The', 'season', 'show', 'really', 'turned', 'corner', '100th', 'episode', ""'re"", 'Welcome', 'where', 'Cordelia', 'made', 'triumphant', 'brief', 'return', 'was', 'true', 'Cordy', 'season', '3', 'not', 'vacuous', 'superficial', 'teenager', 'Buffy', 'pawn', 'evil', 'Angel', 'Season', '4', 'one', 'appearance', 'really', 'helped', 'direct', 'rest', 'season', 'final', 'conclusion', 'ending', 'scene', 'brought', 'tears', 'usually', 'unemotional', 'eyes.After', 'point', 'little', 'comic', 'element', 'including', 'flashback', 'WWII', 'spike', 'wearing', 'Nazi', 'jacket', 'was', ""n't"", 'Nazi', ""'d"", 'just', 'eaten', 'one', 'liked', 'jacket', 'one', 'most', 'darkly', 'humorous', 'episodes', 'history', 'television', 'Smile', 'Time', 'where', 'Angel', 'turned', 'puppet', 'scenes', 'where', 'Nina', 'Werewolf', 'attacks', 'puppet', 'Angel', 'was', 'absolutely', 'hilarious', 'one', 'where', 'puppet-Angel', 'vamps', 'out', 'fight', 'scene', 'had', 'stitches.After', 'humor', 'turmoil', 'must', 'bid', 'farewell', 'Fred', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'fan', 'series', 'who', 'did', 'not', 'love', 'Fred', 'death', 'subsequent', 'metamorphosis', 'Illyria', 'caused', 'as', 'much', 'amongst', 'fans', 'did', 'amongst', 'characters', 'death', 'seemed', 'simultaneously', 'eliminate', 'hope', 'happy', 'ending', 'same', 'time', 'emphasize', 'fight', 'must', 'go', 'end', 'season', 'weekly', 'plotlines', 'are', 'supplemented', 'subtle', 'yet', 'powerful', 'indications', 'something', 'big', 'go', 'down', 'Angel', 'become', 'desensitized', 'evil', 'least', 'becoming', 'part', 'evil', 'worst', 'characters', 'must', 'come', 'terms', 'actions', 'decisions', 'past', 'few', 'years.In', 'midst', 'Connor', 'Only', 'not', 'annoying', 'brat', 'hell', 'dimension', 'once', 'was', 'Now', 'normal', 'intelligent', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'still', 'ca', ""n't"", 'escape', 'destiny', 'year', 'Connor', 'was', 'actually', 'more', 'likable', 'quite', 'bit', 'more', 'attractive', 'when', 'compared', 'previous', 'years.Probably', 'only', 'non-great', 'episode', 'third', 'last', 'Girl', 'Question', 'when', 'Angel', 'Spike', 'go', 'Rome', 'save', 'Buffy', 'old', 'enemy', 'theirs', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'well', 'secondary', 'plot', 'Illyria', 'reverting', 'Burkle', 'persona', 'was', 'dark', 'disturbing', 'What', 'episode', 'are', 'flashback', 'scenes', 'particularly', 'when', 'Drusilla', 'Darla', 'go', 'take', 'bath', 'together', 'Drusilla', 'time', 'pony', 'ride', 'Character', 'development', 'was', 'great', 'season', '5', 'Not', 'single', 'member', 'group', 'remained', 'unchanged', 'case', 'Fred', 'quite', 'literally', 'yet', 'stayed', 'true', 'core', 'values', 'fighting', 'good', 'fight.The', 'last', 'two', 'episodes', 'were', 'quite', 'simply', 'orgasmic', 'Enough', 'said.Favorite', 'episodes', 'Destiny', 'Damage', ""'re"", 'Welcome', 'Smile', 'Time', 'Not', 'Fade', 'Away.Most', 'emotional', 'Destiny', 'A', 'Hole', 'World', 'Shells.Funniest', 'Smile', 'Time', 'Girl', 'Question']",N/A
867163,A3DGB4HN3QCGAL,B0006GAO54,A. Burchfield,"[2, 15]","After the depressing mess that was 4th season I was hoping that 5th season would be an improvement, it was in many ways.5th started out with a well done tie-in to the series finale of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"", introducing James Marsters to the cast. The general tone of the final season wasn't so dark and dreary at first with the variety of cases and not so end of the worldish.As time went by things began to get 'different' somehow. I didn't mind Spike starting out as non-solid but why couldn't the writers have at least said something about ""Lilah"", Stephanie Romanov, just dropping ""Eve"" in without much in the way of explanation. I didn't mind the blonde werewolf story, pretty good except it wasn't revisited except as a weak excuse for no Buffy (according to the quotes & trivia Sarah Michelle Gellar turned down a couple of spots, busy filming ""Grudge"", her presence would've helped out some). The two best stories I thought were the 100th episode of the series in which Charisma Carpenter made her only appearance and the one in which the gang had to deal with an insane slayer who'd escaped from a mental hospital. Other than James Marsters' appearances this one was the first of only two episodes in which any former ""Buffy"" cast members appeared. It was good, I just wish they'd gotten someone other than Tom Lenk, ""Andrew"", for the spot. He also did the later episode in which Angel & Spike went off to Rome to ""save"" Buffy from dating some enemy of theirs, pitiful excuse for a distant (they never even managed to talk to her) Buffy double in that one.The last run of episodes was especially sad, maybe the writers were giving up, the way ""Fred"" was used. Amy Acker did do ""Lilith""(?) well enough I just didn't like the storyline.I doubt there will be a movie so buy this set, it'll be the last you get of Angel.",3,Better than 4th season but it was time for it to end,1107475200,"02 4, 2005",2005,1830,"['depressing', 'mess', 'was', '4th', 'season', 'was', 'hoping', '5th', 'season', 'would', 'be', 'improvement', 'was', 'many', 'ways.5th', 'started', 'out', 'well', 'done', 'tie-in', 'series', 'finale', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'introducing', 'James', 'Marsters', 'cast', 'general', 'tone', 'final', 'season', 'was', ""n't"", 'so', 'dark', 'dreary', 'first', 'variety', 'cases', 'not', 'so', 'end', 'worldish.As', 'time', 'went', 'things', 'began', 'get', ""'different"", 'somehow', 'did', ""n't"", 'mind', 'Spike', 'starting', 'out', 'non-solid', 'why', 'could', ""n't"", 'writers', 'have', 'least', 'said', 'something', 'Lilah', 'Stephanie', 'Romanov', 'just', 'dropping', 'Eve', 'much', 'way', 'explanation', 'did', ""n't"", 'mind', 'blonde', 'werewolf', 'story', 'pretty', 'good', 'was', ""n't"", 'revisited', 'weak', 'excuse', 'Buffy', 'according', 'quotes', 'trivia', 'Sarah', 'Michelle', 'Gellar', 'turned', 'down', 'couple', 'spots', 'busy', 'filming', 'Grudge', 'presence', 'would', ""'ve"", 'helped', 'out', 'two', 'best', 'stories', 'thought', 'were', '100th', 'episode', 'series', 'Charisma', 'Carpenter', 'made', 'only', 'appearance', 'one', 'gang', 'had', 'deal', 'insane', 'slayer', 'who', ""'d"", 'escaped', 'mental', 'hospital', 'Other', 'James', 'Marsters', 'appearances', 'one', 'was', 'first', 'only', 'two', 'episodes', 'former', 'Buffy', 'cast', 'members', 'appeared', 'was', 'good', 'just', 'wish', ""'d"", 'gotten', 'someone', 'other', 'Tom', 'Lenk', 'Andrew', 'spot', 'also', 'did', 'later', 'episode', 'Angel', 'Spike', 'went', 'Rome', 'save', 'Buffy', 'dating', 'enemy', 'theirs', 'pitiful', 'excuse', 'distant', 'never', 'even', 'managed', 'talk', 'Buffy', 'double', 'one.The', 'last', 'run', 'episodes', 'was', 'especially', 'sad', 'maybe', 'writers', 'were', 'giving', 'up', 'way', 'Fred', 'was', 'used', 'Amy', 'Acker', 'did', 'do', 'Lilith', 'well', 'enough', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'storyline.I', 'doubt', 'will', 'be', 'movie', 'so', 'buy', 'set', ""'ll"", 'be', 'last', 'get', 'Angel']",N/A

And I do understand why the other reviewers lied the ending.  But after the BUFFY ending this one kind of let me down. Since we didnt get a sixth season they could have at least let us know how the battle turned out. I might have to bribe Joss Whedon to write an EXTRA end story that explains it.To me the fifth season was the best. Especially because Spike(my personal hero) was involved. And Amy Acker was gorgeous and powerful as Illyria. Even though Wesley made some bad decisions his fight and enemy at the end were poetic after a fashion.If I ever get my druthers I may write a Buffy/Angel possible future fanfic and get a friend to draw stills like a manga.The Slayer Coalition and the Demon Three(Angel , Spike, Illyria) would make a good combo.

867168,ABSX5TGEGRH76,B0006GAO54,"Andrew ""Radaar""","[19, 24]","I have never been a superstitious person, but Friday February 13, 2004 was one of the unluckiest days in the lives of many people.  On that day, executives at The WB sent a memo to the cast and crew of Angel.  At that time, Angel's ratings were climbing ever higher (I think they were at an all-time high), many new fans were tuning in every week (myself included), and Angel was the #2 show on The WB in its demographics group (Smallville was #1, and it was actually losing ratings).  The memo stated that Angel's fifth season would be its last and they had the rest of the season to wrap things up.I'll come back to that later.  Angel's fifth year picks up about 20 days after the events in Home, the Season 4 finale.  Angel (David Boreanaz) and his friends had been given control of the LA division of Wolfram and Hart, free to do whatever they wanted with it.  As we already knew from last year, Angel became CEO, Wesley Wyndam-Pryce (Alexis Denisof) became the head of the research department, Fred Burkle (Amy Acker) became the head of the science division, Lorne (Andy Hallet) was put in charge of the entertainment department, and Connor (Vincent Kartheiser), Angel's son, had his memories erased and was placed in a loving family.  This year, we finally learn what happened to Gunn (J. August Richards); he underwent a procedure to artificially place an extensive knowledge of the law into his brain, so now we have Gunn the lawyer, which is an interesting turn for the character.  But just as the crew begins to get settled into their new jobs, an unexpected curveball is thrown their way.  Spike (James Marsters), the other vampire with a soul, is (mostly) ressurected after his heroic death in the Hellmouth last year.  The amulet that he used to destroy the First's vampire army held on to his essence, and it was annonymously mailed to Angel.  When he opened the package, Spike emerged as a ghost.So for the first 1/3 of the season, Spike is incorporeal, and he takes out his frustration by annoying Angel and wooing Fred.  Its mostly pretty funny, but after a while, the whole ghost routine gets a little tiresome.  His body is finally returned to him in the 8th episode, and there was much rejoicing.Meanwhile, Angel is dealing with feelings of doubt about taking the job at W&H;, due to all the gray areas they run into on the job.  For example, many of their clients are demons and/or sorcerors who, if displeased by Angel and co., can unleash some pretty powerful forces upon LA.  So in order to save the city, Angel is forced to help out his scumbag clientele.For about the first 7 episodes, there isn't much of a story arc (or so we think).  One of the reasons is that The WB execs further meddled with the show; they told Joss that, unlike the serialized 4th Season, they wanted year 5 to be more episodic so they could attract new fans.  I'll give them this- it worked.  As I said earlier, ratings for Angel soared this year.  However, while the first few episodes were very good, one of the things fans like about shows like Angel and Buffy is the grand story arcs.  In episode 8, the episode where Spike becomes corporeal again, things really start to pick up.  Angel begins to worry that he might not be the vampire that the Shanshu prophecy mentioned, Spike finally beats Angel in a fight, and an old adversary resurfaces.  After that, things continue to spiral downward for Angel and his friends.  A man who calls himself Doyle and claims he gets visions fromt the Powers That Be tries to get Spike to become a hero for the masses and counteract the evil Wolfram and Hart led by Angel, Cordelia (Charisma Carpentar), after falling into a mystical coma last year, regains consciousness in a world she barely recognizes, Angel is haunted by dreams where Spike becomes a great hero while he is forced to become a recluse, and worst of all, Fred is killed by the demon spirit Illyria who then proceeds to take over Fred's body.Despite the episodic focus this year, a lot happened, and most of it was very enjoyable to watch.  The whole Angel/Spike relationship was a riot, as well as a little inspiring as they put aside their differences in order to become powerful allies for the forces of good.  The new character of Illyria was very interesting as well as comical in her own way, and yet the loss of Fred will reverberate through fans hearts forever.  Still, as sad as I was to see Fred go, Illyria was a breath of fresh air.  Gunn's overall arc was completed this year.  He started out as a future-less street punk, became a force for good, achieved greatness through his new intelligence, committed a serious offense through it (accidentally of course), and, like a true hero, sought redemption.  Wesley's further descent into madness and depression was both sad and intruiging.  He probably has had the most dramatic character arc I have ever seen.  The nerdy watcher from Buffy is long gone.  By the end of this season, he can barely stand to be in this world any more.  Finally, the reemergence of Angel's old nemesis was a very welcome twist.  Their new relationship, which grew through the mutual hatred of W&H;, was an interesting turn.  The appearance of Andrew in a few episodes was priceless.  The only thing that got me a little angry was that they had Buffy two episodes, but Sarah Michelle Gellar wouldn't guest on the show, so we only saw her from behind, and her minimal dialogue was recycled lines from old episodes.  Oh well.  This year's arc was ingenius; the lack of an arc WAS the arc.  Yes, it sounds confusing, but by the end, Angel realized that, by sitting around and accepting the world as it was, he is no longer the hero he used to be.  Solution: seek more redemption!This is probably my favorite season, but it is a very close call.  So many of the episodes were great this year.  This season had the series' funniest episode Smile Time, where Angel turned into a little puppet!  It also had an episode called Life of the Party, which was funny, but it was kind of a copy of the Buffy episode Something Blue.  The season's very best episodes (they were all good, so here are the best of the best): Conviction, Hellbound, Lineage, Destiny, Soul Purpose, Damage, You're Welcome (100th episode!), Smile Time, A Hole In the World, Shells, Underneath, Origin, The Girl In Question, Power Play, and Not Fade Away.The extras for the set are, for the most part, really good.  There was a featurette with Joss talking about his favorite episodes.  It was similar to the one on the Buffy Season 7 set, except instead of listing his Top 10 episodes, Joss talked about his favorite episodes from each season.  He only went through Season 4, though, but I think that the Season Overview listed his favorite episodes from this year.  Most of the other featurettes were entertaining enough.  Finally, I've watched most of the commentaries, and they have been pretty good for the most part.  The two best in my opinion were the ones for Conviction and A Hole In The World, both of which had Joss Whedon.  One of my favorite lines was from the Conviction track; they started the year thinking that this would be their last season, and by the time they actually got cancelled, they had come to believe that they WOULD get a sixth season.  However, I must say that I was extremely disappointed by the commentary for Not Fade Away, the series finale.  Buffy's series finale, Chosen, got an awesome commentary track from Joss; it was informative about the story and had great little anecdotes.  This commentary was from another Mutant Enemy crew member, who focused on production aspects rather than the story.  Those are all well and good for most episodes, but for such an important story, we want to hear about the backstory to the writing, abandoned ideas, and possibly even what they were planning if there had been a Season 6.  Also, the little jokes and anecdotes he made were pretty stupid, as if he were trying to hard to be Joss.  But overall, the extras were good.Here is what I have to say about Not Fade Away: the reaction to this episode is a little polarized.  A lot of fans liked it, while others didn't due to the way it ended the series.  Personally, I thought it was a great episode.  However, it did not end the series the way I would have wanted it to.  WARNING, SPOILER.  I think that a show like Angel deserves closure, and this episode did not give it.  My theory is that Joss Whedon was angry with The WB (and he had every right to be) for cancelling his show when it was doing so well, and he knew that fans would direct their anger at the TV station and not him.  Also, this leaves the door open for future Angel stuff.As of right now, things are looking very ironic.  Joss Whedon is working on Serenity and some X-Men comics, and most of the cast and crew have gotten jobs elsewhere, and, while they miss doing Angel, they are content where they are.  The WB is a different story.  They are feeling a lot of pain due to the loss of Angel.  A lot of fans decided to boycott the network due to the cancellation of the show, and a lot of their new programming is not earning high ratings.  They want Joss to come back to do some Angel spin-off movies (or ressurect the show), but right now, it doesn't seem very possible.So current events aside, this is definitely a must for any Whedon fan's collection.  This is my favorite season of Angel, and it was also many others' as well.  Also, if you've never seen the show before, you should definitely check it out, but you might want to start at the beginning.  Enjoy the show, and hope for a return of the Vampire with a Soul someday.",5,Angel Reborn,1099440000,"11 3, 2004",2004,9643,"['have', 'never', 'been', 'superstitious', 'person', 'Friday', 'February',

867173,A1FE06N5A77K8W,B0006GAO54,Annie Feng,"[9, 11]","First of all, I just want to say that this season has probably THE BEST COVER design for Angel. The past years' DVD cover of Angel all made Angel look soooo ugly and not like him, especially season four's, Angel look so ugly on the cover. But season five's Angel actually brings out Angel (and DB)'s beauty, his beautiful, intense eyes, his intelligence, his struggle, his broodiness, and his sadness.Season five is probably the most unique of all the Angel seasons. All the episodes indicate that Angel is moving to the next level. Although the insert of Spike can never replace our beloved Cordelia, his placement definitely proves that Angel is moving up, that there's another equally as powerful warrior as Angel to fight along side the team. Spike also replaced the muscle role that used to be Gunn's. Spike is also an important role in because he just completely reflects Angel. He keeps Angel in check, he's Angel's dual self, and in a way, he's Angel's inheritor. Unlike Angel, Spike wanted a soul, he didn't suffer as much as Angel, and unlike Angel, Spike is looking forward to a future, and he has things to look forward to. This brings me to say about the series finale, we all want Angel to shanshu, we all know he's earned it, but if he did, what then? He still has to face with the problems he did in season one when he was turned into a human. In Buffy, Buffy should get a happy ending because if you recall in Angel season one, Angel sacrificed his happiness so that Buffy can live, so that he can protect Buffy and everybody else. So if Buffy ended up dying that would've been completely in vain. In a way, Angel sacrificed his future for Buffy, so Buffy can have a future, therefore Buffy have a future. Also, in the past seasons of Angel, Angel learned the important thing that fighting shouldn't be about rewards, that one fight because one cares, not because of reward, one might never get a reward, one might never be appreciated, then why should one care? Angel couldn't have said it better: ""It doesn't matter where we come from, what we've done or suffered, or even if we make a difference. We live as though the world was what it should be, to show it what it can be; if nothing we do matters, then all that matters is what we do, the smallest act of kindness is the greatest thing in the world."" And ""Not Fade Away"", with all its ambiguity and disappointment, concluded this important theme of Angel. Angel's signing away his reward is significant in many ways, that he no longer cared about the reward, and that he is willing to sacrifice everything for what he believes in. But also, it is like Angel is giving his reward to Spike who is more fitting in turning into a human, not because he deserved it more than Angel, but that he can do more with the reward than Angel. So the question becomes, did Angel EVER get his redemption? This is of course, base on opinion, but in my opinion, he did. His son is his redemption, that his son is finally grateful for what Angel has done for him, and finally accepts Angel for what he is. And like in Angel's fantasy, Connor finally comes fighting by Angel's side like Angel has always wanted. Also, Angel's friends, who literately went out and died for Angel, this also is kind of like redemption.As for the numerous death count, we all want good things happen to good people, but it's because of Angel's non-clich&eacute;-ness that makes Angel a superior show. No one can say Angel is a comedy, but Angel does not really follow the main codes of tragedy either, isn't that why we love the show? Each tragic death in season five is touching, beautiful, and meaningful, we grieve for Cordelia, Fred, and Wesley, and they will always be in our hearts as beautiful characters alongside Angel.Like all Angel's seasons, this one has flaws. Season five actually produced some of the worst episodes in Angel history. If you have been reading the Amazon reviews of Angel, it said that season two is Angel's best and worst year. NO this description actually fits perfectly for season five. Here are worst ones: "" Life of the Party""- it has good potential and focuses on Lorne, but it's too cheesy and the whole Halloween-is-important-to-evildoers thing is too clich&eacute; and I really think Angel is way past the "" I'm under a spell doing stupid stuff"" phase; "" The Cautionary Tale of Numero Cinco""- we all know that it's because Angel isn't like a comic hero character that's why we love him, so what's with the return of "" masked-muscle-hero-to-the-rescue""?; ""A Girl In Question""- this episode is suppose to make Buffy's "" out of picture"" conclusion funny, didn't work though, it was horrible. It makes our heroes look silly, puppy-love-sick, and foolish, which by now Angel should be waaayy past that; "" Why We Fight""- this episode has good ideas and tried to bring about the incident where Angel does an evil thing to save people. But it totally clashes with Angel. Angel's soul-but-not-now years are suppose to be very reserved years, that's how we can see his incredible transformation, but in this episode Angel seemed very confident, sorry, didn't work, not to mention if you think about it, this episode goes very inconsistent with Angel's history. Overall, season five is a fantastic ending and conclusion to one of the best show on earth.

867175,A2XXV9HF169LCF,B0006GAO54,A. Trotter,"[8, 11]","This season is, in my humble opinion, the best. It's even a little better than the first season, which was in turn better than seasons 2 3 and 4 (all of which blur together in my mind.)  It actually hurts to watch on an emotional level; things happen that are terrible, all the way up to the end. Things also happen that are ridiculous and silly and fun, but the general theme is of working even when you're in crippling pain.  Not exactly your standard smurfs topic.The fifth season is darker and sadder than the first four. Everyone has by now told you something about the finale - that it is not happy, or cheerful, or any of the things that you expect from your known-in-advance series finales; things are wrapped up, but a final act is left unseen, merely implied. Everyone who watches the show has an opinion on what happens after the close of the show. Every opinion is different. I have faith that Joss will someday tell us; I believe he has it in his will, so that if he dies unexpectedly and doesn't get to tell the story himself we'll still be given closure. (There is no rational basis for that belief but there you go, there's no rational basis for most of the theories surrounding the end of Angel.)Now, there are some character changes that go on. I won't list them. The one thing I will list is the episode everyone lists, the one that once you've seen it you absolutely have to list - the one where Angel turns into a puppet. Yes, literally, ok? A little stuffed Muppets-type puppet. It sounds hokey; it's not. It actually, somehow, works.Honestly, I'm thinking of reasons you ought to buy this, and weirdly I've come up with a reason not to: it's so intense that you'll watch it through once and it'll be tough to go through all that again any time soon. It's heart-wrenching, it wrings you out to watch it. After the season is done you're exhausted. It's a good season to watch when you're having a bad day, or bad week, or bad year; after you finish the season you'll get that I've just cried my eyes out wiped-out feeling, and then you feel better.The biggest reason I love this show is this: it gives us characters who do the hard thing, the painful thing, the hopeless thing even when they can't possibly pull through. It gives us people who fight and fight and fight, and die. It gives us people who live with honor, people who come back from a terrible thing. It show us that people can change. That every day you can get up and if you fell down yesterday and the day before adn the day before that, it doesn't mean you stop trying.",5,Best season.

867176,A5FBTQE8QFWFQ,B0006GAO54,"Avid Fan ""David""","[3, 10]","The one thing I loved about this show is that it actually had a great series finale episode. Angel was one of my favorite shows about vampires and demons and even though it was spawned of the Buffy series it was more superior that Buffy. Let be honest here Buffy started to suck when it went to the UPN network. And what killed it more was the musical episode. But angels only problem was his son he was to annoying and was a real pain in the you know where.But the 2 most saddest episodes to me was the 100th Episode. When (SPOILER ALERT DO NOT READ THIS SECTION IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THESE EPISODES!)Cordy came back only to find out that Angel was being helped by her spirit form and that she died in the hospital after she finiahed helping Angel.And the Final episode when you see wesley die in the arms of illiria/Fred. But the show ended with a sure bang and did not dissapoint there loyal fans. The worst this show could have done was finsh with the WB and then go to UPN like Buffy did. And I think the WB series finale of buffy was great. But no matter what Angel proved to be a true cult classic and will be remembered by many fans for its grittiness, dark story telling, sadness and suprising humor.

867177,A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ,B0006GAO54,"Barry ""Barrybgb""","[9, 11]","There were many new changes and surprises in store for the fifth season of Angel. Taking over Wolfram & Hart and the inclusion of Spike top among them. But none more surprising than the news halfway through the season that this would be the critically acclaimed show's final season. It was way too early. While the reviews that state this season was weak and a sad send-off have some kind of point, they are only half right. The first half of the season was weak. It was slow and not up to par. That changed with the second half of the season, which kicked things up and exploded into the Angel show that we know and love. Their budget was cut in half as part of the show's deal to return, so the location shoots and all that stuff were minimal in the first half. Things kicked off with ""Conviction"", a decent season opener that showed the Angel gang's new digs at the evil firm and how are they accustomed to it. The follow up, ""Just Rewards"", with Angel and the ghostly Spike was fun and a lot better. The first half was too talky, slow, and it seemed they just walked around the new offices a lot. ""Unleashed"" and ""The Cautionary Tale Of Numero Cinco"" were somewhat entertaining, but it didn't show the series hitting it's full potential. Despite the introduction of hot werewolf Nina. The graphic and dark ""Hell Bound"" was a great ep, as was the Angel/Spike duel in ""Destiny"". It was nice to see Lorne with his own episode in ""Life Of The Party"", but despite some funny moments, it was a forgetful episode. Wesley's upbringing is finally brought out in ""Lineage"", as we meet his father. The story and dynamic is strong and powerful, but was another talky, walk around the offices episode. Eve, the liasion to the powers that be, was not a strong character either. Hamilton(Adam Hamilton)should have been the liasion from the beginning. Things didn't kick into high gear until ""Damage"", a fantastic episode with a psychotic slayer that was dark, exciting, interesting, and thrilling. The 100th episode, ""You're Welcome"", was one of the best ever. The return of Charisma Carpenter, who looked better than ever, reminded us that the show is not the same without her. ""Smile Time"" is one of the best Angel episodes ever, and one of the best and most interesting eps in the Angel/Buffy/Joss Whedon canon. It shows how good the writers are to make a silly idea into a solid and brilliant episode. The Illyria storyline(and the end of Fred)begins in the brilliant ""A Hole In The World"", which is an ep full of emotional loss and showcases Amy Acker and Alexis Denisoff in two powerhouse performances. The conclusion, ""Shells"", is more exciting and just as good. It was nice to have the return of Connor in ""Origin"", and to give that storyline some kind of closure. Great episode. ""The Girl In Question"", while not an important ep in the Angel universe, is still silly and a whole lot of fun. Plus there was Andrew!. What is there not to like?. The finale, ""Not Fade Away"", was a grand episode. It was nothing but exciting, thrilling, tense, sad, and heartbreaking. The very ending upset some people, but I understand what they were doing. The inclusion of James Marsters as Spike was a nice move, but was it really needed for the show besides luring more viewers?. Not really. Spike is nice to have, but the season wouldn't of been that much different or any less without him. The return of Christian Kane as Lindsey was a great touch, as was bringing Harmony in as Angel's secretary. There were more stand alone eps this year, but there was an arc this season with the Angel gang taking over the firm and the constant struggle they try to fight to show that they haven't gone over to the dark side, but are trying to change the dark side from within. The writing and directing is still as good as ever, and the cast was one of the finest casts on TV. The show was trying to find it's feet in the first half of the season, and most shows stumble when they have such a change. But the season really came into it's own beginning with the second half and brought itself up to the level of past seasons we hold the show at. It is unfair to see the slow, weak first half as a representation of the whole season. Once it kicks in, it is glorious, and a number of those eps rise to some of the best Angel has done. Stand alones or arc-y ones. The cancellation was a gigantic mistake. The ratings were up, and they opened a new door of creativity. With the two new dramas The WB replaed it with dying painful deaths, I hope it makes the powers that be realize what a mess they have made. Season 5 of Angel delivers, and it's a shame it had to end so soon.

At W&H; that all vanished. The addition of Spike was incredibly stupid and his attempt to cover for Cordelia's snarky attitude failed...just like it did on Buffy. The introduction of Eve (a poor man's Lilah Morgan) and Knox are quite possibly the most best examples of the most hated characters in the Buffyverse. Lorne, who used to be funny, is stripped of any comical antics. Fred dies, but it really is wiped of any emotionality seeing as how Cordy was killed off liek 2 weeks earlier. Gunn gets a new gig as a lawyer (with hair) but it is not believable. Wes still pines after Fred...tired old plot device. Returns from Darla & Dru (flashbacks only) and Connor & Sahjan. Really poor episodes like the submarine one (BORING), the intro of the stupid werewolf girl (lame ending complete with atypical WB music in the background), a fantastic idea for a puppet show which was excuted incredibly poorly.I give this season 2 stars for 2 reason. First hiring Harmony as the secretary. A definite plus since she was both familiar and adept at comedy, her stand-out episode was a treat and one of the best of the season.

And with this being the single best season of ""Angel,"" that means it's one of the best seasons of TV ever, and THAT means this show is definitely worth your dollars.Want proof?  Here's a run-down of what you'll find on these DVDs:(1)  Conviction:  This season premiere is the single episode of the series that, thanks to a VCR malfunction, I have never seen.  But it's written and directed by the Whedon himself, so it's bound to be excellent.(2)  Just Rewards:  A good episode that sets up the relationship between Angel and Spike for the rest of the season.(3)  Unleashed:  A good werewolf episode that introduces a new character who, I feel sure, would have important to future seasons of the series.(4)  Hell Bound:  A creepy-as-hell Spike episode.(5)  Life of the Party:  Awesome Ben Edlund-penned episode featuring high hilarity, including a Hulk-like Lorne.(6)  The Cautionary Tale of Numero Cinco:  One of my personal favorite episodes, simply because it's so unusual.  If you enjoy Mexican wrestlers, this one will work for you, too.(7)  Lineage:  A moving episode featuring Wesley, as well as some good Spike scenes.(8)  Destiny:  A big, big episode for the Angel/Spike storyline.(9)  Harm's Way:  Finally, Harmony gets her own episode!  It's a very funny one, too, one of the highlights of the first half of the season.(10)  Soul Purpose:  David Boreanaz directed this one, and he did an excellent job considering that this isn't one of the better scripts for the season.  Great scenes with Spike make up for a lot, though.(11)  Damage:  Sort of a sequel to the final episode of ""Buffy,"" featuring a visit to town by Andrew and a deranged Slayer who does bad things to one of our heroes.  A great episode.(12)  You're Welcome:  One of the best episodes of the series, or even of the Buffyverse altogether.  Cordelia returns to offer Angel exactly the sort of help he needs.(13)  Why We Fight:  A strange WW2 flashback episode.  One of the weakest episodes of the entire series, but not without a few good scenes.(14)  Smile Time:  Another great Ben Edlund episode, this one involves Angel being turned into a Muppet.  Seriously, seriously funny.(15)  A Hole in the World:  Joss Whedon's second episode of the season, and probably -- apart from the finale -- the best episode of the year.  Absolutely gut-wrenching.(16)  Shells:  An important new character, Illyria, is introduced, and immediately begins kicking butts left and right.  A very good episode that follows up admirably the previous one.(17)  Underneath:  Adam Baldwin makes his first appearance as Hamilton.  This is a good episode, but not quite as good as the ones before and after it.(18)  Origin:  Connor's storyline from season four is brought more or less to a conclusion, and it's a fitting conclusion, too.  Another good episode.(19)  Time Bomb:  Fantastic Illyria episode, with a couple of shocks along the way.  Amy Acker is fantastic, as always.(20)  The Girl in Question:  Notable for being the episode Sarah Michelle Gellar was supposed to appear in, but didn't.  Honestly, though, it works better without her.  A classic episode, and a tantalizing peek at what season eight of ""Buffy"" might have been.(21)  Power Play:  Another fantastic David Fury episode.  This one sets up the finale perfectly.(22)  Not Fade Away:  It's perfect.

867181,A3T8G3FN3H3948,B0006GAO54,bryhil_04,"[0, 0]","This season had many twists and turns throughout, which made it really exciting. Amy Acker proves what an amazing actress she is, as she switches from the sweet, little innocent girl, to, well, lets just put it this way: Illyria. A thousand year old demon, whose incredibly unfamiliar with the human ways, and despises humans, yet seems to have a bit of a conscience. The chemistry between David and James is amazing. They really make the season entertaining! Mercedes McNab returns as Harmony, to possibly fill in Cordy's shoes, and she does it quite well! I thought she was really funny. Lorne didn't have enough parts throughout the season, but when he did, he made the best of it!Conviction- 5/5 Angel must stop a client from blowing up LA with a bomb that he put in his own son. This was a great beginning, that introduced Eve, brought in Harmony and Spike returns as a ghost.Just Rewards- 5/5 Spike episode, great!! Spike's a great character, setting up Angel for the fall, that's too awesome!!Unleashed- 4.5/5 I like Nina, well, not at first, but once I saw her in Smile Time, I decided that she was a nice girl and deserved to have someone that liked her. She was sweet! Though I don't think her and Angel would work, she definitely lightens up Angel's world.Hellbound- 4.5/5 Spike vs. the Reaper. Though not as scary as the trailer made it out to be, it's still awesome!!Life of the Party- 4/5 Though it's not a great episode, plotwise, the character interaction is great and who doesn't love the positive Spike? And it's the only episode where Lorne is in it alot. They misused his character this season, he deserved more lines.The Cautionary Tale of Numero Cinco- 4/5 It's a nifty tale of an older man who has given up on his mission because his brothers have passed away. Angel realizes that that's what his life is probably going to be like after. Because he'll probably outlast everyone, except maybe Spike and Harmony.Lineage- 4.5/5 Wesley's father pays him a visit, only it's not quite Wesley's father. Just something pretending to be. Good old Wes, count on him to screw everything up!! Just like Angelus said.Destiny- 5/5 Who couldn't help but love this thrillride? Angel or Spike, take your pick. They both head for a cup that supposively will turn them human if they drink from it. Lindsey returns as Eve's boyfriend.Harm's Way- 5/5 I love this episode because it is obviously about Harmony! She is framed for a murder and has to find out who it is with her small brain.Soul Purpose- 5/5 As everyone knows, David's first directed episode, it was great! Eve tries to kill Angel in his sleep(well, sorta. It's by placing a bug on Angel and he has nightmares until it kills him). Spike is out saving people, with help from Lindsey. Though he is nowhere near as polite as Angel.Damage- 5/5 A psycho slayer has escaped a mental institution and Andrew returns to tell Angel, that he works for W&H;, they are not on the same side. Also, to take the psycho slayer away.You're Welcome- 5/5 The BEST EPISODE EVER! Cordy awakens from her coma and she and Angel team up to take down Lindsey, who has used some tattoes and symbols to stay hidden from the senior partners.Why We Fight- 4/5 A vampire Angel turned back in the 1940's at war, is back and has captured some of Angel's assosiates. Flashbacks show Spike is aboard the same ship and he doesn't know that Angel has a soul. Angel is forced to turn the guy into a vamp when the ship is about to sink and he is the only one that can fix the problem: except he is dying.Smile Time- 5/5 One of the best, this is so funny!! It's fantastic episode. Nothing more to say.A Whole in the World- 4.5/5 Wes and Fred are now together, only to find that Fred is dying and a demon is taking over her body- though it's nothing like Cordy's inner demon. Angel and Spike try to find a way to save her before it is too late.Shells- 5/5 Illyria has completely taken over Winifred and she is now gone from Angel and the crew for good. Illyria searches for its army. Wesley is now gone mad because he misses Fred.Underneath- 4.5/5 Eve is relieved from her duties and an insane and creepy, Hamilton, is appointed new liaison to the senior partners for Angel.Origin- 4.5/5 Connor is back, after his parents go to Angel because Connor was hit by a truck and was fine afterward. Wesley uncovers that Angel signed a deal with W&H;, but he thinks it can bring Fred back. Angel doesn't want Wesley to know about it because if he breaks the jar, then Connor will remember everything. Connor is put up against Sajan.Time Bomb- 4.5/5 Illyria has time swap momments, and in one, she kills Spike, Lorne, Wesley and Angel. Angel hints that he might be evil.The Girl in Question- 4/5 I like the flashbacks and the episode is pretty funny, but the plot is silly and did anyone believe that to be Buffy? I didn't think so.Powerplay- 5/5 And we get more of the possible evil Angel. There should have been more episodes like this, it was so interesting and entertaining. We don't know what's going on!! Gotta hand it to David in this one! Love this episode.Not Fade Away- 5/5 The exiciting conclusion to the series, though I understood Joss's ending, it is still kinda a cliff hanger. Angel battles Hamilton, Spike is stealing the baby from evil demons, Illyria takes down the red demon guys(forget their name), Gunn fights vamps and nearly dies and Wesley is killed by a demon. Lorne kills Lindsey, who would have thought. Even Lindsey didn't suspect that. And Lorne is finished. Illyria shows signs that she might not be that bad after all.Special Features: 5/5 Featurettes on Smile Time, You're Welcome and Shells, an overview of the season, bloopers(which are hilarious), the villains(includes looks at Darla, Drusilla, Lindsey and Lilah), and Joss mentions some of the best Angel episodes, including:I Will Remember YouEternityAre You Now Or Have you Ever Been?Waiting in the WingsSleep TightSpin the BottleRain of FireThe Magic BulletHomeAnd he didn't cover the 5th season, but I think you already now the highlights. Here are my pics for the top 10 Angel episodes ever. It's a great season and fantastic show, definitely buy this, out!!10. Harm's Way9. Rain of Fire8. Spin the Bottle7. Reunion6. Orpheus5. Release4.

867183,A2E3F04ZK7FG66,B0006GAO54,calvinnme,"[1, 1]","Angel Season Five was perhaps the best season of the series, which made its cancellation by the soon to be defunct WB all the more puzzling.In season five, we find the show basically reinventing itself. It had done that to some degree once already in season two, when the show went from a ""Monster of the Week"" format to the type of story arcs that are a trademark of the Buffy the Vampire Slayer series.At the beginning of the season we find the Fang Gang taking over the LA offices of Wolfram & Hart, their long time nemesis. As a result, each member of the team is handed their dream on a platter. Fred gets a state-of-the-art science lab at her disposal, Wesley has a dream library and research team, Lorne gets to work with celebrities, and Gunne receives a ""brain upgrade"" that makes him a talented attorney with all of the respect that goes with it. Thrown in as a monkey-wrench to everyone's new situation is the addition of Spike to the team- initially as a ghost- who cannot leave the premises and thus reluctantly joins the group dynamic. Spike reminds Angel of how he has gone adrift from his initial mission, and there is much conflict between these two ""vampires with a soul"" until by the end of the season they have made an uneasy truce. Although the first half of the season may seem a bit uneven in regard to the overall story arc, the individual episodes are quite good.Ironically, just as the show was cancelled around episode twelve, things began to come together and some of the best storytelling of any of the seasons of Angel takes place. Cordelia returns in ""Your Welcome"" to put Angel back on the right path, and the ending of that show is a tear-jerker and a shocker for any long-time viewer. ""Smile Time"" is hilarious as Angel is turned into a puppet by mystical forces. In ""Smile Time"" we also see David Fury, one of the writers, make a campy cameo appearance as a kind of ""Captain Kangaroo From Hell"".There is also tragedy as one of the Fang Gang is unable to let go of what Wolfram and Hart has given him and then apparently taken away. He makes a ""deal with the devil"" to regain what he has lost that ultimately causes the death of one of his friends. In ""Origin"" there is the return of Angel's son, Conner, who has been given a new life with a new family and no memory of what came before in exchange for Angel's acceptance of the job at Wolfram & Hart. The last scene of that episode, in which Conner comes to terms with both his new life and his old, and finally understands his father's love for him, is especially touching.The season finale seems a bit forced due to the show's sudden cancellation and the need to tie together all loose ends in just a couple of episodes. However, it is brilliantly done, and unlike the series finale of Buffy, the fate of the surviving characters is left up in the air.",5,Brilliant ending to a brilliant - and inexplicably cancelled show,1125100800,"08 27, 2005",2005,2839,"['Angel', 'Season', 'Five', 'was', 'perhaps', 'best', 'season', 'series', 'made', 'cancellation', 'soon', 'be', 'defunct', 'WB', 'more', 'puzzling.In', 'season', 'five', 'find', 'show', 'basically', 'reinventing', 'had', 'done', 'degree', 'once', 'already', 'season', 'two', 'when', 'show', 'went', 'Monster', 'Week', 'format', 'type', 'story', 'arcs', 'are', 'trademark', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'series.At', 'beginning', 'season', 'find', 'Fang', 'Gang', 'taking', 'over', 'LA', 'offices', 'Wolfram', 'Hart', 'long', 'time', 'nemesis', 'result', 'member', 'team', 'handed', 'dream', 'platter', 'Fred', 'state-of-the-art', 'science', 'lab', 'disposal', 'Wesley', 'dream', 'library', 'research', 'team', 'Lorne', 'work', 'celebrities', 'Gunne', 'brain', 'upgrade', 'talented', 'attorney', 'respect', 'Thrown', 'monkey-wrench', 'everyone', 'new', 'situation', 'addition', 'Spike', 'team-', 'initially', 'ghost-', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'leave', 'premises', 'thus', 'reluctantly', 'group', 'Spike', 'Angel', 'how', 'gone', 'adrift', 'initial', 'mission', 'much', 'conflict', 'two', 'vampires', 'soul', 'end', 'season', 'have', 'made', 'uneasy', 'truce', 'first', 'half', 'season', 'may', 'seem', 'bit', 'uneven', 'regard', 'overall', 'story', 'arc', 'individual', 'episodes', 'are', 'quite', 'good.Ironically', 'just', 'show', 'was', 'cancelled', 'episode', 'twelve', 'things', 'began', 'come', 'together', 'best', 'storytelling', 'seasons', 'Angel', 'place', 'Cordelia', 'Welcome', 'put', 'Angel', 'back', 'right', 'path', 'ending', 'show', 'tear-jerker', 'shocker', 'long-time', 'viewer', 'Smile', 'Time', 'hilarious', 'Angel', 'turned', 'puppet', 'mystical', 'forces', 'Smile', 'Time', 'also', 'see', 'David', 'Fury', 'one', 'writers', 'make', 'campy', 'cameo', 'appearance', 'kind', 'Captain', 'Kangaroo', 'From', 'Hell', 'also', 'tragedy', 'one', 'Fang', 'Gang', 'unable', 'let', 'go', 'what', 'Wolfram', 'Hart', 'given', 'then', 'apparently', 'taken', 'away', 'deal', 'devil', 'regain', 'what', 'lost', 'ultimately', 'death', 'one', 'friends', 'Origin', 'return', 'Angel', 'son', 'Conner', 'who', 'been', 'given', 'new', 'life', 'new', 'family', 'memory', 'what', 'came', 'before', 'exchange', 'Angel', 'acceptance', 'job', 'Wolfram', 'Hart', 'last', 'scene', 'episode', 'Conner', 'terms', 'new', 'life', 'old', 'finally', 'father', 'love', 'especially', 'touching.The', 'season', 'finale', 'bit', 'forced', 'due', 'show', 'sudden', 'cancellation', 'need', 'tie', 'together', 'loose', 'ends', 'just', 'couple', 'episodes', 'However', 'brilliantly', 'done', 'series', 'finale', 'Buffy', 'fate', 'surviving', 'characters', 'left', 'up', 'air']",N/A
867184,A2F18IRDZCNOLP,B0006GAO54,"Christopher Miner ""Chris""","[6, 8]","I am a hardcore Buffy and Angel fan, who has bought and repeatedly watched all the season DVD sets.  This is one of the best, if not the very best, seasons of either show.  The addition of Spike to the cast is priceless.  He brings every other actor on the show, especially David Boreanez, to a higher level.  The season was much crazier, funnier, darker and heartbreaking than any before it, and that's saying a lot.  Some people criticize the stand alone nature of the episodes, something the network demanded in order to get a fifth season.  I like the freedom it gave the producers to do different things.  One episode has Angel turned into a muppet, the next has him and Spike on a German submarine during World War II.  There is not a weak episode in the set.  Amy Acker and Alexis Denisof get their finest showcases of the series.  It is worth going back to previous seasons to see how much they have evolved.

Please give this show a chance you will not regret it. Yes, season 1 was slow but that's how it is usually. Afterwards, the show continues to grow. Season 5 is probably my favorite because of Spike and the storyline. I was pretty sad about FRED. Wesley is such an amazing character who becomes his own person on Angel. I love what they did to him. This was worth all my money. Please someone tell me a show out there rite now that beats Angel and Buffy. I mean the writing was sooo good this season how could WB even think to cancel this show?

867186,AUPYKCIQEITAS,B0006GAO54,Cinephile,"[9, 13]","Scan any number of websites devoted to Joss Whedon, or reviews in magazines and newspapers, and the general consensus seems to be that this season of ""Angel""-- the show's fifth-- is easily its finest.  Many reasons are cited-- the addition of Spike, Angel's enemy/rival from parent program ""Buffy""; the greater participation by Whedon, by Fall 2003 free of his Buffy/Firefly/Fray duties; the more episodic structure and greater humor, especially when compared to the operatic intensity of Season Four. I also suspect the praise for Five is enhanced by its martyr status, since the program was suddenly and surprisingly canceled by the WB to make way for a ""Dark Shadows"" remake (which, ironically, never aired, although the Frog was kind enough to bless us with ""The Mountain"" this fall, which suggests Mutant Enemy was lucky to escape the network's clutches when it did).I don't share in this general opinion-- in fact, I think this is easily ""Angel""'s weakest season.  Season Four set up this year's narrative conceit-- that, after four years of battling evil law firm Wolfram and Hart, our ragtag heroes would take it over, hoping to battle demonic evil from within the beast's belly.  It's a brilliant idea, and an example of the program's ability to constantly challenge itself.  Unfortunately, the execution is less interesting than the concept.  This season lacks the narrative and tonal complexity of the previous four seasons; it is slow to start, and takes about half the year to figure out how to integrate the heroes into their new environment. Similarly out of place is Spike-- it takes nothing away from James Marsters' considerable talent to suggest he's never really fit into the more noirish and brooding spaces of ""Angel,"" and while he has some great moments here (his chemistry with star David Boreanaz has always been strong), much of the time he just takes up space, like a fanboy token.  In taking up that space, he minimizes screen time for the series regulars the show's worked so hard to develop in previous years: particularly slighted in the first half of the year is Alexis Denisof's Wesley, arguably the most complex and important character in the Angel universe. The show also suffers grievously from the loss of two stalwarts: Charisma Carpenter, who, for reasons that are still unclear, was not rehired for the fifth season, and series co-creator David Greenwalt, who left after the third season (he comes back to direct one ep, and it's one of the season's best); without the biting wit of Cordelia and wry maturity of Greenwalt's writing and direction, the show's more adolescently melodramatic tendencies tend to dominate (particularly disappointing in this regard is ""A Hole in the World,"" whose narrative twist is crucial and yet somehow underwhelming).  The WB's business moves don't help: it's clear the writers expected a sixth season, and were forced to rush certan plot points to resolve them by the end of the year.And yet, there sits my four-star rating. Maybe I'm as schizo about the fate of the Angelverse this year as the program's titular hero, a vampire cursed with a soul, battling for redemption.  One thing to keep in mind is that ""weak"" is a relative term, and the standard set by Years 1-4 of this deeply underrated program is quite high. If Season Five lacks the coherence of Three, the rich emotional drive of Two or the scope and ambition of Four, it's still full of good moments. ""Smile Time"" alone is worth the price of the box, and an example of how good the show can be when firing on all cylinders. ""The Cautionary Tale of Numero Cinquo,"" writer Jeffrey Bell's tribute to Mexican wrestling (don't ask, just watch) pops like ""Band Candy"" on Buffy.  When David Greenwalt shows up to direct the fabulous inside joke, ""The Girl In Question,"" he offers a smart and stylish resolution to the Buffy/Angel/Spike triangle that's positively Felliniesque.  And the return of Cordelia for one ep is not only the season's high point, but might just be among the five best ""Angel""s ever. Gunn's journey over the course of the year, while a bit heavy-handed, is moving, and once Denisof is given something to play in the second half of the year, he reminds us of how strange, funny, and crucial Wesley is. Mercedes McNabb is always a delight as ditzy vampire Harmony, a woman who never saw a herd she wouldn't join.  Throw in a moving final episode, and this season offers plenty to be proud of, while also cleaning up many of the mistakes of Buffy Season Seven. It's more than enough to make up for Valley Girl lawyer Eve, a pale shadow of the program's previous femme fatale, Lilah; the murkiness of plot points involving evil lawyer Lindsay and the menacing Senior Partners; the misguided war pastiche ""Why We Fight""; and the bewildering use of Lorne, a fabulous character whose journey really ended in the middle of Season Four.It doesn't give anything away to say that the show ends where it started: in an alley.  Alleys are a recurring motif in Whedon's work, and I'm not sure why, beyond their obvious noir resonances. They are a dead end, and yet they nearly always have a regenerative quality in Whedon's work (babies are born, vampires created, evil thwarted).  Whedon is a musical comedy geek, and I am reminded of scenes from countless musicals, like ""The Band Wagon,"" where stars meet in the alley backstage, to offer up tentative declarations of love, good luck and praise or criticism (this link is most explicit in Season Three, when a baby is born in a rainy alley outside a destroyed karaoke club). The show must go on, even when trapped in a dead end. That makes it the perfect visual metaphor for this conflicted season. Even when facing impossible odds-from fictional villains to real-life network heads-Angel, show and character, find reasons to fight and entertain their audiences.",4,alleys and byways,1105574400,"01

867188,A21B2TJBWCSK1R,B0006GAO54,Cubist,"[11, 15]","The cruel irony of the fifth season of Angel is that not only was it the best season, it was also the last. After Buffy the Vampire Slayer went off the air, several of its writers started working on episodes for Angel. The difference was apparent right from the season opener. There was a much more playful attitude and the dialogue had more snap to it and more of a zing that was missing from previous seasons. The addition of James Marsters to the cast also helped greatly as he brought his own unique brand of charisma and energy to the show.Each disc features an audio commentary on a specific episode with the writers and directors, and sometimes with a member of the cast (including David Boreanaz, Christian Kane and Adam Baldwin). Joss Whedon contributes a surprisingly sedate commentary on ""Conviction"" but bounces back on the one for ""A Hole in the World,"" where he is joined by Amy Acker and Alexis Denisof. Most of the tracks explore various plot points and offer production anecdotes. Some are a tad on the dull side (like the one for ""Destiny"") while others quite chatty and informative (""Underneath"").Disc one also includes the ""Hey Kids! It's Smile Time"" featurette which examines the episode where demons possess puppets on a kids show. The cast (and quite humourously, the puppets) are interviewed and talk about the challenge of pulling off this episode.Disc four features ""Angel 100,"" which documents the celebration of the 100th episode of the show. Whedon talks about how he wanted to shake things up with this season. The cast talks with pride at reaching this milestone in television.The fifth disc includes ""Angel: Choreography of a Stunt,"" a featurette that examines the stunts in the ""Shells"" episode. Boreanaz's stunt double takes us through one stunt that involves Angel being thrown through an office building and shows us how it was done.The sixth disc features a season overview as cast and crew talk about the predominant themes: trying to do good from within the corporate machine that is Wolfram and Hart.""To Live and Die in L.A.: The Best of Angel"" has Joss pick his favourite episodes from the show's entire run and explain why he likes them so much.""Halos and Horns: Recurring Villainy"" examines the most popular bad guys (and girls) on the show. Juliet Landau, Julie Benz, Christian Kane and others talk about their characters and working on the show.Finally, there is ""Angel Unbound: The Gag Reels,"" a good collection of funny line readings, blown lines and pratfalls that fans of the show will enjoy.It's disappointing that a smart, funny show like Angel could not garner decent enough ratings to stay on the air. It had a good run but was ultimately cut down in its prime, just when it was hitting its stride.

867193,A13BP4NJEBZGEY,B0006GAO54,"Drew Macevenwick ""sanmarnan""","[7, 9]","All right, I may have to duck behind something and hide because Whedon fans don't like it when their shows are critisized but here goes anyway:Yes, Angel season 5 is by a wide-margin my least favorite season of the series. Just thought I'd get the most negative statement of the review out of the way.At the end of Angel season 4, Cordelia had been left in a coma. Angel had made a deal with Wolfram & Hart to take over their Los Angeles branch provided his son Connor was given new memories and a happy home that he himself could never provide. Season 5 finds the Fang Gang uneasy in their new offices. As they are beginning to adjust, Spike appears out of nowhere in ghost-like form to haunt and annoy Angel.Most of the people I've heard say they dislike Angel season 5 tend to think Spike is the problem with this season. That may be true for some fans who were never big Buffy viewers, but the addition didn't bother me. I was always a bigger Buffy fan than an Angel fan and Spike was a big part of that show. Nor was it the lack of Cordelia that irked me. I'd loved her in season one and two but the whole Angel loves Cordelia storyline, followed by the evil Cordy story had kind of killed the character for me.I think for me the show was just starting to run out of steam. There are certainly many people who will disagree with that statement, but hear me out at least. I think the reason people think the show could have carried on for a few more years is because the final storyline is a particularly good one and the last episode is great (definitely a lot better than Buffy's). But all of the really good things about this season came after it was cancelled and things had to be wrapped up. The first half of this season is (for the most part) quite mediocre. Up until season 5, Angel had only had one really bad episode in my opinion (season one's ""She""), although many of the individual Cordelia/Connor scenes in season 4 had been a little hard to swallow. In early season 5, I sat through three episodes in a row that were all pretty bad (""Hellbound"", which I struggled to stay awake during, ""Life of the Party"" which is basically a less funny remake of Buffy's ""Something Blue"", and ""Cautionary Tale of Numero Cinco"" which spent a lot of time concentrating on an unimportant/uninteresting character). To be fair, those were followed by ""Lineage"" which was fantastic. For much of the first half of season 5, the rest of the Fang Gang aren't given much to do, but for this one episode, Angel actually felt like Angel again. ""Soul Purpose"" was also a lackluster episode, though not to the same extent. Tom Lenk's guest appearence in ""Damages"" was somewhat awkward. I liked Andrew on Buffy, but that's one character that really just didn't seem to fit the tone on Angel.Now that we're through with the unpleasant complaining, let's get to the good part of Angel season 5. As the show began to build up to the end, Joss Whedon got back to business. Fred is killed off in a heartbreaking episode, to be inhabited by the powerful Illyria. Wes is sent back to his dark place, and is in no mood to be forgiving when he discovers Gunn had a role in Fred's demise. Meanwhile, Angel seems to be going to a darker and darker place.Anyway, I must say that I do like this series and parts of this season. I just feel that Angel peaked in season 2 and never got to be that good again. I was upset like everyone else when it got cancelled, but that seems to have been a blessing in disguise. It allowed Joss to really move things along in the latter half of season 5 and let the show end on a high note. People like to say it could have gone on several more seasons, but I feel like it would have done so in a diminished capacity. Buffy season 5 was (in my opinion) far stronger than Angel season 5 and Buffy definitely went downhill by staying on the air for two more seasons (although it was never terrible). Overall, I think five seasons is a pretty good run. Certainly the loss of Firefly is a greater tragedy. I would recommend this set to fans of the series, although I would warn them that the rest of the series is quite a bit better.",3,The Beginning of the End,1191283200,"10 2, 2007",2007,4139,"['right', 'may', 'have', 'duck', 'something', 'hide', 'Whedon', 'fans', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'when', 'shows', 'are', 'critisized', 'here', 'anyway', 'Yes', 'Angel', 'season', '5', 'wide-margin', 'least', 'favorite', 'season', 'series', 'Just', 'thought', ""'d"", 'get', 'most', 'negative', 'statement', 'review', 'way.At', 'end', 'Angel', 'season', '4', 'Cordelia', 'had', 'been', 'left', 'coma', 'Angel', 'had', 'made', 'deal', 'Wolfram', 'Hart', 'take', 'over', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'branch', 'provided', 'son', 'Connor', 'was', 'given', 'new', 'memories', 'happy', 'home', 'could', 'never', 'provide', 'Season', '5', 'Fang', 'Gang', 'uneasy', 'new', 'offices', 'are', 'beginning', 'adjust', 'Spike', 'nowhere', 'ghost-like', 'form', 'haunt', 'annoy', 'Angel.Most', 'people', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'say', 'dislike', 'Angel', 'season', '5', 'tend', 'think', 'Spike', 'problem', 'season', 'may', 'be', 'true', 'fans', 'who', 'were', 'never', 'big', 'Buffy', 'viewers', 'addition', 'did', ""n't"", 'bother', 'was', 'always', 'bigger', 'Buffy', 'fan', 'Angel', 'fan', 'Spike', 'was', 'big', 'part', 'show', 'was', 'lack', 'Cordelia', 'irked', ""'d"", 'loved', 'season', 'one', 'two', 'whole', 'Angel', 'Cordelia', 'storyline', 'followed', 'evil', 'Cordy', 'story', 'had', 'kind', 'killed', 'character', 'me.I', 'think', 'show', 'was', 'just', 'starting', 'run', 'out', 'steam', 'are', 'certainly', 'many', 'people', 'who', 'will', 'disagree', 'statement', 'hear', 'out', 'least', 'think', 'reason', 'people', 'think', 'show', 'could', 'have', 'carried', 'few', 'more', 'years', 'final', 'storyline', 'particularly', 'good', 'one', 'last', 'episode', 'great', 'definitely', 'lot', 'better', 'Buffy', 'really', 'good', 'things', 'season', 'came', 'was', 'cancelled', 'things', 'had', 'be', 'wrapped', 'up', 'first', 'half', 'season', 'most', 'part', 'quite', 'mediocre', 'season', '5', 'Angel', 'had', 'only', 'had', 'one', 'really', 'bad', 'episode', 'opinion', 'season', 'one', 'many', 'individual', 'Cordelia/Connor', 'scenes', 'season', '4', 'had', 'been', 'little', 'hard', 'swallow', 'early', 'season', '5', 'sat', 'three', 'episodes', 'row', 'were', 'pretty', 'bad', 'Hellbound', 'struggled', 'stay', 'awake', 'Life', 'Party', 'basically', 'less', 'funny', 'remake', 'Buffy', 'Something', 'Blue', 'Cautionary', 'Tale', 'Numero', 'Cinco', 'spent', 'lot', 'time', 'concentrating', 'unimportant/uninteresting', 'character', 'be', 'fair', 'were', 'followed', 'Lineage', 'was', 'fantastic', 'much', 'first', 'half', 'season', '5', 'rest', 'Fang', 'Gang', 'are', ""n't"", 'given', 'much', 'do', 'one', 'episode', 'Angel', 'actually', 'felt', 'Angel', 'again', 'Soul', 'Purpose', 'was', 'also', 'lackluster', 'episode', 'not', 'same', 'extent', 'Tom', 'Lenk', 'guest', 'appearence', 'Damages', 'was', 'somewhat', 'awkward', 'liked', 'Andrew', 'Buffy', 'one', 'character', 'really', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'fit', 'tone', 'Angel.Now', ""'re"", 'unpleasant', 'complaining', 'let', 'get', 'good', 'part', 'Angel', 'season', '5', 'show', 'began', 'build', 'up', 'end', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'got', 'back', 'business', 'Fred', 'killed', 'off', 'heartbreaking', 'episode', 'be', 'inhabited', 'powerful', 'Illyria', 'Wes', 'sent', 'back', 'dark', 'place', 'mood', 'be', 'forgiving', 'when', 'Gunn', 'had', 'role', 'Fred', 'demise', 'Meanwhile', 'Angel', 'be', 'going', 'darker', 'darker', 'place.Anyway', 'must', 'say', 'do', 'series', 'parts', 'season', 'just', 'feel', 'Angel', 'peaked', 'season', '2', 'never', 'got', 'be', 'that', 'good', 'again', 'was', 'upset', 'everyone', 'else', 'when', 'got', 'cancelled', 'have', 'been', 'blessing', 'disguise', 'allowed', 'Joss', 'really', 'move', 'things', 'latter', 'half', 'season', '5', 'let', 'show', 'end', 'high', 'note', 'People', 'say', 'could', 'have', 'gone', 'several', 'more', 'seasons', 'feel', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'so', 'diminished', 'capacity', 'Buffy', 'season', '5', 'was', 'opinion', 'far', 'stronger', 'Angel', 'season', '5', 'Buffy', 'definitely', 'went', 'downhill', 'staying', 'air', 'two', 'more', 'seasons', 'was', 'never', 'terrible', 'Overall', 'think', 'five', 'seasons', 'pretty', 'good', 'run', 'Certainly', 'loss', 'Firefly', 'greater', 'tragedy', 'would', 'recommend', 'set', 'fans', 'series', 'would', 'warn', 'rest', 'series', 'quite', 'bit', 'better']",N/A

The very place they have fought on and off for the previous four seasons along with ally Cordellia Chase (who is in a coma for most of this season).We also see the return of Spike. Angel's former vampire ally who met his death on the seventh and final season of Buffy The Vampire Slayer but somehow survived and is brought back first as a semi-ghost and then fully coporeal. Issues between Angel and Spike surface during this season from their pasts as Angelous and William The Bloody respectively over both Drusillia (Spike's sire/lover) and Buffy Summers (former lover of Angel and later Spike). There is also an on-going tee a tee between the two because of the fact that they are both vampires with souls.Other angles see Gunn gain newfound intelligence as well as Fred and Wesley getting together briefly only to see Fred die and become the demon Illyria. We also see the return of Connor (Angel's son) as well as Lindsey MacDonald, Angel's on and off nemesis during the season.In the emotional 100th episode, we see the return of Cordellia as she returns to Angel to keep him on the right path as he begins to stray. Sadly, she dies at the end but gives Angel (and the fans) the long awaited kiss before exiting.I have seen all the episodes from Angel from every season and this one nearly makes up for the previous season which suffered from rushed plots in my view (though it still had its moments)!Overall, see Angel and his gang fight to the end in this good closure to the TV series.",5,The Final Season,1205971200,"03 20, 2008",2008,1720,"['was', 'final', 'season', 'hit', 'sci-fi/horror', 'series', 'Angel', 'season', 'Angel', 'allies', 'Winifred', 'Fred', 'Burkle', 'Wesley-Wyndham', 'Price', 'Lorn', 'empath', 'demon', 'Charles', 'Gunn', 'take', 'over', 'Wolfrham', 'Hart', 'lawfirm', 'very', 'place', 'have', 'fought', 'previous', 'four', 'seasons', 'ally', 'Cordellia', 'Chase', 'who', 'coma', 'most', 'season', '.We', 'also', 'see', 'return', 'Spike', 'Angel', 'former', 'vampire', 'ally', 'who', 'met', 'death', 'seventh', 'final', 'season', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'somehow', 'survived', 'brought', 'back', 'first', 'semi-ghost', 'then', 'fully', 'coporeal', 'Issues', 'Angel', 'Spike', 'surface', 'season', 'pasts', 'Angelous', 'William', 'Bloody', 'respectively', 'Drusillia', 'Spike', 'sire/lover', 'Buffy', 'Summers', 'former', 'lover', 'Angel', 'later', 'Spike', 'also', 'on-going', 'tee', 'tee', 'two', 'fact', 'are', 'vampires', 'souls.Other', 'angles', 'see', 'Gunn', 'gain', 'newfound', 'intelligence', 'as', 'well', 'Fred', 'Wesley', 'getting', 'together', 'briefly', 'only', 'see', 'Fred', 'die', 'become', 'demon', 'Illyria', 'also', 'see', 'return', 'Connor', 'Angel', 'son', 'as', 'well', 'Lindsey', 'MacDonald', 'Angel', 'nemesis', 'season.In', 'emotional', '100th', 'episode', 'see', 'return', 'Cordellia', 'Angel', 'keep', 'right', 'path', 'stray', 'Sadly', 'end', 'Angel', 'fans', 'long', 'awaited', 'kiss', 'exiting.I', 'have', 'seen', 'episodes', 'Angel', 'season', 'one', 'nearly', 'up', 'previous', 'season', 'suffered', 'rushed', 'plots', 'view', 'still', 'had', 'moments', 'Overall', 'see', 'Angel', 'gang', 'fight', 'end', 'good', 'closure', 'TV', 'series']",N/A

It took the show back to what it was in the early days, a touching metaphor for life, while keeping you entertaining you. It also helped that this season has so many funny episodes.From the onset, it was clear this might (Unfortunatly) be the last season, and what an amazing final season arc they gave us. Angel & friends fighting evil, from within an evil law firm. Yet they proved they could still keep their integrity.The highlighted episodes are ""Hellbound,"" where the producers dare to tell a border line horror story. ""Life Of The Party,"" where we finally see a Lorne story line, and the 1st non-stop laugh out loud episode. (Fred: How much have you had to drink? Wesley"" About a half of a third of this beer!) ""Destiny,"" anther insightful flashback episode, where we learn why Angel & SPike hate each other so. ""You're Welcome,"" Cordy returns, as well as Angel's old nemesis, the lawyer Lindsey, to have the best fight sequence since Angel meet The Beast on a roof top last year. ""Smile Time,"" another episode to laugh you to death which has Angel transformed intp a puppet (though a puppet with vampire strength). And of course the finale, which transforms our heroes into legends!The season only had one episode without any purpose at all, ""The Girl In Question."" This episode has Angel & Spike running aorund like school boys, looking for Buffy (who mind you isn't even in the episode), and getting bullied by some ugly minions of a villian (who also mind you is not in the epsode - nor was he ever in an episode). Even episodes that didn't have to been done, like ""Harm's Way,"" & ""Why We Fight"" were enjoyable.The DVD features are also great. Lot's of insightful commentaries, by all your favorites on the crew. Even David Boreanez finally makes one, and let's face it - you want the lead actor to do one (at least).Alot of cool featurettes. The season overview was great. I did not see the point of doing another featurette on making the stunts (as they out on the season 2 set), but it's still pretty cool. I also did not like that the interviews about Smile Time were not on the same disc as the episode, but a minor detail. Thought they did take the time to interview everyone involved in the episode, including the puppets, lol.I was glad to see some outtakes, but disapointed that there was again no deleted scenes. Atleast this time the gag reel was funny (season 4's wasn't).I am always bummed out that the people doing commentary keep talking about deleted scenes, but Fox is to cheap to let up see them. I guess they see leaving them on a shelf to collect dust as a good place for them.A pleasant suprise is that they left the ""previously on Angel"" clips at the begining of the episodes. Even though there were only about 3 episodes this season that had previously clips, I still like to see them.One last thing to talk about is the artistic design of the packaging. If you have been collecting Angel on DVD, then you know they like to put quotes all over the inside from various episodes. However, after season 1, they got tired, and put quotes from only 2 episodes. Here they use quote a nice assortment. And oh the pictures around are nice to.Though the season/series ends on a cliff hanger, dispite what Joss Whedon says. It was a great way to end. Redemption enver ends, and the fight goes on. I don't believe for one second that they lost that final battle. It's just that now the next phase is left to our imaginations, which is why so many fan are writting fan fictions (whether spin-offs or a virtual season 6).",4,Legend,1110758400,"03 14, 2005",2005,3565,"['season', 'was', 'great', 'took', 'show', 'back', 'what', 'was', 'early', 'days', 'touching', 'metaphor', 'life', 'keeping', 'entertaining', 'also', 'helped', 'season', 'so', 'many', 'funny', 'onset', 'was', 'clear', 'might', 'Unfortunatly', 'be', 'last', 'season', 'what', 'amazing', 'final', 'season', 'gave', 'Angel', 'friends', 'fighting', 'evil', 'evil', 'law', 'firm', 'proved', 'could', 'still', 'keep', 'integrity.The', 'highlighted', 'episodes', 'are', 'Hellbound', 'where', 'producers', 'dare', 'tell', 'border', 'line', 'horror', 'story', 'Life', 'Party', 'where', 'finally', 'see', 'Lorne', 'story', 'line', '1st', 'non-stop', 'laugh', 'loud', 'episode', 'Fred', 'How', 'much', 'have', 'had', 'drink', 'Wesley', 'half', 'third', 'beer', 'Destiny', 'anther', 'insightful', 'flashback', 'episode', 'where', 'learn', 'why', 'Angel', 'SPike', 'hate', 'other', 'so', ""'re"", 'Welcome', 'Cordy', 'returns', 'as', 'well', 'Angel', 'old', 'nemesis', 'lawyer', 'Lindsey', 'have', 'best', 'fight', 'sequence', 'Angel', 'meet', 'Beast', 'roof', 'top', 'last', 'year', 'Smile', 'Time', 'episode', 'laugh', 'death', 'Angel', 'transformed', 'intp', 'puppet', 'puppet', 'vampire', 'strength', 'course', 'finale', 'heroes', 'legends', 'season', 'only', 'had', 'one', 'episode', 'purpose', 'Girl', 'Question', 'episode', 'Angel', 'Spike', 'running', 'aorund', 'school', 'boys', 'looking', 'Buffy', 'who', 'mind', ""n't"", 'even', 'episode', 'getting', 'bullied', 'ugly', 'minions', 'villian', 'who', 'also', 'mind', 'not', 'epsode', 'was', 'ever', 'episode', 'Even', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'done', 'Harm', 'Way', 'Why', 'Fight', 'were', 'enjoyable.The', 'DVD', 'features', 'are', 'also', 'great', 'Lot', 'insightful', 'commentaries', 'favorites', 'crew', 'Even', 'David', 'Boreanez', 'finally', 'one', 'let', 'face', 'want', 'lead', 'actor', 'do', 'one', 'least', '.Alot', 'cool', 'featurettes', 'season', 'overview', 'was', 'great', 'did', 'not', 'see', 'point', 'doing', 'featurette', 'making', 'stunts', 'out', 'season', '2', 'set', 'still', 'pretty', 'cool', 'also', 'did', 'not', 'interviews', 'Smile', 'Time', 'were', 'not', 'same', 'disc', 'episode', 'minor', 'detail', 'Thought', 'did', 'take', 'time', 'interview', 'everyone', 'involved', 'episode', 'including', 'puppets', 'lol.I', 'was', 'glad', 'see', 'outtakes', 'disapointed', 'was', 'again', 'no', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'time', 'gag', 'reel', 'was', 'funny', 'season', '4', 'was', ""n't"", '.I', 'am', 'always', 'bummed', 'out', 'people', 'doing', 'commentary', 'keep', 'talking', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'Fox', 'cheap', 'let', 'up', 'see', 'guess', 'see', 'leaving', 'shelf', 'collect', 'dust', 'good', 'place', 'them.A', 'pleasant', 'suprise', 'left', 'previously', 'Angel', 'clips', 'begining', 'episodes', 'Even', 'were', 'only', 'about', '3', 'episodes', 'season', 'had', 'previously', 'clips', 'still', 'see', 'them.One', 'last', 'thing', 'talk', 'artistic', 'design', 'packaging', 'have', 'been', 'collecting', 'Angel', 'DVD', 'then', 'know', 'like', 'put', 'quotes', 'inside', 'various', 'episodes', 'However', 'season', '1', 'got', 'tired', 'put', 'quotes', 'only', '2', 'episodes', 'Here', 'use', 'quote', 'nice', 'assortment', 'pictures', 'around', 'are', 'nice', 'season/series', 'cliff', 'hanger', 'dispite', 'what', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'was', 'great', 'way', 'end', 'Redemption', 'enver', 'fight', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'one', 'second', 'lost', 'final', 'battle', 'just', 'now', 'next', 'phase', 'left', 'imaginations', 'why', 'so', 'many', 'fan', 'are', 'writting', 'fan', 'fictions', 'spin-offs', 'virtual', 'season', '6']",N/A

He was there to fight with Angel like they were an old husband and wife. Good for a few eps over on Buffy, but every week on Angel?Then the transformation of Gunn, Lorne and even Angel were bad. Especially Gunn, who I loved in War Zone and missed so much the last couple of season. Lorne became background noise, and Angel sort of morphed back and forth into the selfish brat he can be. I missed Lindsay and the old Cordy. I even wanted Lilah back.Then there was the utterly bad The Girl in Question which is the WORST.ANGEL.EPISODE.EVER.

867206,A1TQAK53H2LT5Q,B0006GAO54,H. Heavens,"[0, 0]","Season 5 of Angel went out like every series should strive for. That one ending that you never forget and always think back on. What most people don't realize is Angel had some outstanding writers pour their heart and soul into the material and actors that actually made you believe in them. There are few shows which stand out as truly extraordinary. Battlestar Galactica, Lost, Buffy, LA. LAW, Star Trek TNG, these shows along with Angel i truly believe will go down as classics, shows that you will want to show your grandchildren to remind them of a time when great shows existed.Season 5 of Angel moves them out of their Motel and into the belly of the ""Corporate Teet"" as Spike would call it of Wolfram and Heart. Why did the Law Firm who's sole purpose was to convert Angel to Angelus and make him fulfill their dark needs for the upcoming Apocalypse suddenly hang over the reigns of the L.A. Branch to him.....makes sense now that you think about it huh. Throughout the season Angel and the Fang Gang struggled with this very concept. It took its toll on them leading up to one of their members dying. This was a very emotional season of Angel for many reasons and some chars who we have seen over the years and cheered for do not make it out of this season. The season for the most part has many stand alone episodes, but even the standalone ones are contained superbly into a sort of long arc revolving around the choices they made to come to Wolfram and Hart, and the consequences they pay for that choice. When it boils down to it, thats what every season of Angel has been about, Redemption, actions, and living with those actions.This season is not all gloom however, it has two of the top 5 funniest episodes of the whole series in my opinion, ""Harms Way"" in which Harmony goes on a mission to clear her name of a murder that will just have you in tears, and the ever so popular ""Smile Time"", make no mistake, i have seen every episode of Angel and numerous times at that and i can safely say without a shadow of a doubt that Smile Time is the funniest episode in the entire series. The show will literaly have your stomach hurting from laughing so hard.  This season with the addition of Spike added much to the Angel Saga, and its only a shame that we couldnt see more of their relationship throughout the coming years.If for some reason you are reading this review and have not seen this season or never seen angel at all and are asking yourself if it is worth it, let me just make this clear.  This show was a modern day masterpiece, if you are a fan of great acting, witty dialogue, conflicts with the human heart, outstanding writing, and just the right dose of action/drama/comedy/adventure than look no further.",5,An ending to probably my favorite show of all time.,1188259200,"08 28, 2007",2007,2734,"['Season', '5', 'Angel', 'went', 'out', 'series', 'should', 'strive', 'one', 'ending', 'never', 'forget', 'always', 'think', 'back', 'What', 'most', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'realize', 'Angel', 'had', 'outstanding', 'writers', 'pour', 'heart', 'soul', 'material', 'actors', 'actually', 'made', 'believe', 'are', 'few', 'shows', 'stand', 'out', 'truly', 'extraordinary', 'Battlestar', 'Galactica', 'Lost', 'Buffy', 'LA', 'LAW', 'Star', 'Trek', 'TNG', 'shows', 'Angel', 'i', 'truly', 'believe', 'will', 'go', 'down', 'as', 'classics', 'will', 'want', 'show', 'grandchildren', 'remind', 'time', 'when', 'great', 'shows', 'existed.Season', '5', 'Angel', 'Motel', 'belly', 'Corporate', 'Teet', 'Spike', 'would', 'call', 'Wolfram', 'Heart', 'Why', 'did', 'Law', 'Firm', 'who', 'sole', 'purpose', 'was', 'convert', 'Angel', 'Angelus', 'make', 'fulfill', 'dark', 'needs', 'upcoming', 'Apocalypse', 'suddenly', 'reigns', 'L.A', 'Branch', 'sense', 'now', 'think', 'season', 'Angel', 'Fang', 'Gang', 'struggled', 'very', 'concept', 'took', 'toll', 'leading', 'up', 'one', 'members', 'dying', 'was', 'very', 'emotional', 'season', 'Angel', 'many', 'reasons', 'chars', 'who', 'have', 'seen', 'years', 'cheered', 'do', 'not', 'make', 'season', 'season', 'most', 'part', 'many', 'stand', 'alone', 'episodes', 'even', 'standalone', 'ones', 'are', 'contained', 'superbly', 'sort', 'long', 'arc', 'revolving', 'choices', 'made', 'come', 'Wolfram', 'Hart', 'consequences', 'pay', 'choice', 'When', 'down', 'what', 'season', 'Angel', 'been', 'about', 'Redemption', 'actions', 'living', 'actions.This', 'season', 'not', 'gloom', 'however', 'two', 'top', '5', 'funniest', 'episodes', 'whole', 'series', 'opinion', 'Way', 'Harmony', 'mission', 'clear', 'name', 'murder', 'will', 'just', 'have', 'tears', 'ever', 'so', 'popular', 'Smile', 'Time', 'make', 'mistake', 'i', 'have', 'seen', 'episode', 'Angel', 'numerous', 'times', 'i', 'can', 'safely', 'say', 'shadow', 'doubt', 'Smile', 'Time', 'funniest', 'episode', 'entire', 'series', 'show', 'will', 'literaly', 'have', 'stomach', 'hurting', 'laughing', 'so', 'hard', 'season', 'addition', 'Spike', 'added', 'much', 'Angel', 'Saga', 'only', 'shame', 'couldnt', 'see', 'more', 'relationship', 'coming', 'years.If', 'reason', 'are', 'reading', 'review', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'season', 'never', 'seen', 'angel', 'are', 'asking', 'let', 'just', 'make', 'clear', 'show', 'was', 'modern', 'day', 'masterpiece', 'are', 'fan', 'great', 'acting', 'witty', 'dialogue', 'human', 'heart', 'outstanding', 'writing', 'just', 'right', 'dose', 'action/drama/comedy/adventure', 'look', 'further']",N/A

Then the WB decided to cancel it and replaced it with a corny show like the Mountain. It was nice seeing Spike (James Marsters) come to Angel and I was hoping  it would be on a few seasons with him. I was also hoping to see more Buffy cast members jump to Angel. I heard Buffy was gonna show for some episodes but that never happened. Instead we get a glimpse of what's supposed to be her dancing at a club. Would've been nice if Sarah Michelle Gellar did make a cameo though. I mean David Boreanaz was nice enough to make a cameo on her last season of Buffy after all. Plus fans of her would've much rather of seen her on Angel than doing...Scooby Doo 2 or the Grudge.Was one thing about the season that made it kind of messy though. It was whacky sometimes, then it was serious and then whacky again and then it just gets dark and serious as it headed towards the last episodes. It was still always entertaining though. Having Fred (Amy Acker)  becomeIllyria was the most intriging thing about the season though. I actually wanted to see much much more of that character. Plus her and Wesley's relationship was just engaging and touching stuff. Now thinking about it I guess the season does end how it should've. I was disapointed and pissed that it would just end it with Angel and friends getting ready to have a big battle though.However the season did fix some loose ends. Cordelia Charisma Carpenter) comes back for one last episode and it was one of the best of the season. Hell they even mention Doyle in that episode and that was nice considering Glenn Quinn that played him died. Before that he was fired from the show. He wasn't mentioned much since then. Plus Angel's son (Connor ) comes back and he has no memory of Angel. Angel made a deal with Wolfrang and heart "" or whatever they're called lol"" to have Connor and even Angel's friends have no memory of Connor being his son. So Angel and Connor get to bond a little without Connor being ready to kill him for once. It is hard for Angel though to see Connor calling someone else his dad and thinking someone else is his dad. All that is handled nicely though. This season showed how great Angel could be and it could've got better and better.

Although one key character was gone, the remarkable Charisma Carpenter, this season gave us some of the most exciting hours of television in the past few years. Part of this was the addition of James Marsters as Angels Nemesis Spike. The two have excellent chemistry and the bantering back and forth like a married couple was always hilarious to watch. Many episodes were absolutely brilliant. My favorites include Hell Bound, a terrifying episode where Spike is dragged into Hell. Harm's Way, a hilarious episode revolving around the underated Mercedes Mcnab as Harmony, Smile Time, a clever and hysterical episode where Angel turns into a Puppet, and Origin, where Angels son Conner comes back, a emotional and exciting episode. The 2 best episodes of the season are also the most heartbreaking. You're Welcome centers on the return of Cordelia as she awakens from her Coma. This episode is a classic and will have everyone in tears. Finally the best episode is A Hole in The World, where Fred gets sick off of a saccophagus. This episode is one of the most heartbreaking episodes written by the phenomenal Joss Whedon.The cast is always amazing and this is the season where I finally started to love Amy Acker as Fred. Without giving anything away the final 7 episodes Amy was outstanding. Her performance deserved an Emmy Award or something. Who knew? The series finale was exciting, sad, brilliant, funny, and everything Angel has been known for. It's truly one of the best series on television and season 5 proved it could have gone on for at least 2 or 3 more years. With great storytelling like seasons 5, it's a shame we won't get to see what else this remarkable show could have come up with.",5,Saved the Best for Last,1109635200,"03 1, 2005",2005,1781,"['Angel', 'went', 'out', 'bang', 'albeit', 'too', 'soon', 'Season', '5', 'was', 'series', 'best', 'one', 'key', 'character', 'was', 'gone', 'remarkable', 'Charisma', 'Carpenter', 'season', 'gave', 'most', 'exciting', 'hours', 'television', 'past', 'few', 'years', 'Part', 'was', 'addition', 'James', 'Marsters', 'Angels', 'Nemesis', 'Spike', 'two', 'have', 'excellent', 'chemistry', 'bantering', 'back', 'forth', 'married', 'couple', 'was', 'always', 'hilarious', 'watch', 'Many', 'episodes', 'were', 'absolutely', 'brilliant', 'favorites', 'include', 'Hell', 'Bound', 'terrifying', 'episode', 'where', 'Spike', 'dragged', 'Hell', 'Harm', 'Way', 'hilarious', 'episode', 'revolving', 'underated', 'Mercedes', 'Mcnab', 'Harmony', 'Smile', 'Time', 'clever', 'hysterical', 'episode', 'where', 'Angel', 'Puppet', 'Origin', 'where', 'Angels', 'son', 'Conner', 'back', 'emotional', 'exciting', 'episode', '2', 'best', 'episodes', 'season', 'are', 'also', 'most', 'heartbreaking', ""'re"", 'Welcome', 'centers', 'return', 'Cordelia', 'Coma', 'episode', 'classic', 'will', 'have', 'everyone', 'tears', 'Finally', 'best', 'episode', 'Hole', 'World', 'where', 'Fred', 'sick', 'saccophagus', 'episode', 'one', 'most', 'heartbreaking', 'episodes', 'written', 'phenomenal', 'Joss', 'Whedon.The', 'cast', 'always', 'amazing', 'season', 'where', 'finally', 'started', 'love', 'Amy', 'Acker', 'Fred', 'giving', 'anything', 'away', 'final', '7', 'episodes', 'Amy', 'was', 'outstanding', 'performance', 'deserved', 'Emmy', 'Award', 'something', 'Who', 'knew', 'series', 'finale', 'was', 'exciting', 'sad', 'brilliant', 'funny', 'everything', 'Angel', 'been', 'known', 'truly', 'one', 'best', 'series', 'television', 'season', '5', 'proved', 'could', 'have', 'gone', 'least', '2', '3', 'more', 'years', 'great', 'storytelling', 'seasons', '5', 'shame', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'see', 'what', 'else', 'remarkable', 'show', 'could', 'have', 'come', 'up']",N/A
867213,A3RY85QM7F3XF6,B0006GAO54,Josh Brooks,"[4, 5]","This is it. I have officially watched every single episode of Buffy and Angel on television and on DVD. Is this the end of the Buffy/Angelverse? If it is, then the way it went out was near perfect.Angel's fifth season begins with the gang going about their lives awkwardly at their once arch-nemesis, Wolfram and Hart. The beginning of the season is mostly about Spike and his entrance into the show. The peak of this is reached in the fourth episode, Hellbound, which is actually one of the best of the fifth season. It's one of the creepiest of the series too. Things give in to some one-shot episodes in the middle of the season with the stand-out for me being the episode Harm's Way where a day in the life of Harmony is focused upon. Mercedes McNab has one of the most underrated characters in the series, and I'm glad she got this centric episode. She's hilarious. Charisma Carpenter also comes back to give closure to Cordelia (which I wish they would have kept her for the remainder. I miss Cordelia.)Things definitely begin to pick up with the departure of Fred and the arrival of Illyria in the episode A Hole in the World. I would like to take the time right now to say that I think Amy Acker is amazing. Her performance as Illyria in the final episodes goes down as one of the best performances of the series in my opinion. In the episode The Girl In Question where Illyria becomes Fred in order to save her parents grief gave me chills. The transition from Illyria to Fred to Illyria in conversation with Wesley was priceless.I do have one complaint. The WB threw the cancellation to the Angel crew mid-season I believe, so they had to end the series. This made the final 2 or 3 episodes or so feel a little rushed with the Black Thorn Circle thrown in and then all of a sudden, a new big apocalypse. Don't get me wrong, it was pulled off very creatively and wonderful, but creatively and wonderfully rushed-like.Although I praised Amy Acker here, the entire cast gives wonderful performances in the episodes genuisely written by the show's writers. David Boreanaz, James Marsters, J. August Richards, Andy Hallet (aw, the best humour in the world), Mercedes McNab and guest appearances from Charisma Carpenter, Vincent D'Onofrio, Thomas Lenk (crossover from Buffy fame, yaaay), and more.

867215,AIQCCJLXIXFVR,B0006GAO54,just me,"[2, 3]","First I want to say I LOVE this series (even better then Buffy). Angel is my #1 favorite series ever (Buffy's #2), but I didn't like this season. It was a completely different show all together. In season 4 they BUTCHERED Cordy's character (making her have sex with Connor, even if she was possessed it was just disgusting) and in season 5 they totally butchered Angel and Spike's characters and killed 3 of my favorite characters. Spike was my favorite character off of Buffy. He was actually the reason I watched the show his character was so fun to watch and funny (you laugh at almost everything he says), but his character went from the funny, rebel of Buffy that never really fit in and didn't really care to almost boring on Angel. And Angel wasn't the character I grew to love watching on his own show through the years either. He became kind of an ass and a lot darker of a character (not Angelus dark and not ""poor me"" Buffy series dark, but kind of like he's just drained and hasn't really care anymore). The show was definitely missing that lighter vibe Cordy brought that they tried to fill by bringing Harmony into the cast (they failed) and it was obvious they tried to make Spike fill in for Gunn (since they change Gunn's charater too), but it doesn't work because like I said they loose the character of Spike in doing so. The only things I liked about the show was the closure it gave to Angel and Connor's relationship and Illyria was actually a pretty cool character (but I would have traded her for a Wes/Fred ship for the season).I also thought Joss was in such a hurry to try and get over the Angel/ Cordy thing once they finished her character that no one seemed to care at all when she died, no one really mentioned it (except Angel a couple times here and there) and Angel within the next couple of episodes is already dating someone else (which I think was a huge disrespect to the character of Cordelia). Even if you don't count the fact that they were in love she was his best and dearest friend and I honestly don't think Angel had he have been himself that season would have gotten over it so fast. I think Joss handled it not only disrespectful to the character of Cordelia, but to Angel's character as well.If you're just watching to see if Angel and Buffy end up together or Buffy and Spike it's a total waste of time as well. She does love BOTH of them, but there is no real closure on the love triangle.In seasons 1-3 they have a mission and it's all like one big novel (like the Harry Potter series) with season 4 rounding it out. Season 5 was just completely different! No more Angel Investigations, no more champions, no more fighting for redemption or to help the helpless, no more working for/with the powers the be, none of the things that made the series, the series. EVERYTHING is gone and everyone's personality changes (or they die, or both). It's like if you watched ""Gone with the Wind"" and everyone wants to know what happens next, but then years after the author dies, some women gets the rights from a relative of the author to do a sequel and it's horrible! They change Scarlett and Rhett's personalites, they have them doing things their characters would never do, and acting in ways their characters would never act and it's just so badly ruined the story for you that you wished you'd never even seen it. That's what they do to the characters in season 5 as continuing of the Buffy & Angel series. I hated the fact that Spike died at the end of season 7 of Buffy, but if I knew they'd butcher his character in season 5 of Angel I would've just rathered they kept him the way he was and ended the Angel series at season 3 or 4.I think the people excited about Spike are just so excited because he's back that they don't even realize that he's not the same character anymore. Also fans of Cordy's probably wont like season 5 and will probably feel the energy missing from it not having her character around. Angel's character also changes drastically not having her around (as I mentioned earlier). Gunn's character totally changes, so fans of Gunn may or may not like the new Gunn, etc. etc.The point to my ramblings is that this season really should not have even happened (Plus the ending sucks). But it got 2 points from me (only because the Illyria character was cool and they ended Connor and Angel really nicely, in my opinion).",2,SERIOUSLY OVER RATED!,1251763200,"09 1, 2009",2009,4389,"['First', 'want', 'say', 'LOVE', 'series', 'even', 'better', 'then', 'Buffy', 'Angel', '1', 'favorite', 'series', 'ever', 'Buffy', '2', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'season', 'was', 'completely', 'different', 'show', 'together', 'season', '4', 'BUTCHERED', 'Cordy', 'character', 'making', 'have', 'sex', 'Connor', 'even', 'was', 'possessed', 'was', 'just', 'disgusting', 'season', '5', 'totally', 'butchered', 'Angel', 'Spike', 'characters', 'killed', '3', 'favorite', 'characters', 'Spike', 'was', 'favorite', 'character', 'Buffy', 'was', 'actually', 'reason', 'watched', 'show', 'character', 'was', 'so', 'fun', 'watch', 'funny', 'laugh', 'almost', 'everything', 'character', 'went', 'funny', 'rebel', 'Buffy', 'never', 'really', 'fit', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'care', 'almost', 'boring', 'Angel', 'Angel', 'was', ""n't"", 'character', 'grew', 'love', 'watching', 'own', 'show', 'years', 'either', 'became', 'kind', 'ass', 'lot', 'darker', 'character', 'not', 'Angelus', 'dark', 'not', 'poor', 'Buffy', 'series', 'dark', 'kind', 'just', 'drained', ""n't"", 'really', 'care', 'anymore', 'show', 'was', 'definitely', 'missing', 'lighter', 'vibe', 'Cordy', 'brought', 'tried', 'fill', 'bringing', 'Harmony', 'cast', 'failed', 'was', 'obvious', 'tried', 'make', 'Spike', 'fill', 'Gunn', 'change', 'Gunn', 'charater', 'too', ""n't"", 'work', 'said', 'loose', 'character', 'Spike', 'doing', 'so', 'only', 'things', 'liked', 'show', 'was', 'closure', 'gave', 'Angel', 'Connor', 'relationship', 'Illyria', 'was', 'actually', 'pretty', 'cool', 'character', 'would', 'have', 'traded', 'Wes/Fred', 'ship', 'season', '.I', 'also', 'thought', 'Joss', 'was', 'such', 'hurry', 'try', 'get', 'Angel/', 'Cordy', 'thing', 'once', 'finished', 'character', 'one', 'seemed', 'care', 'when', 'died', 'one', 'really', 'mentioned', 'Angel', 'couple', 'times', 'here', 'there', 'Angel', 'next', 'couple', 'episodes', 'already', 'dating', 'someone', 'else', 'think', 'was', 'huge', 'disrespect', 'character', 'Cordelia', 'Even', 'do', ""n't"", 'count', 'fact', 'were', 'love', 'was', 'best', 'dearest', 'friend', 'honestly', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Angel', 'had', 'have', 'been', 'season', 'would', 'have', 'gotten', 'so', 'fast', 'think', 'Joss', 'handled', 'not', 'only', 'disrespectful', 'character', 'Cordelia', 'Angel', 'character', 'well.If', ""'re"", 'just', 'watching', 'see', 'Angel', 'Buffy', 'end', 'up', 'together', 'Buffy', 'Spike', 'total', 'waste', 'time', 'well', 'love', 'BOTH', 'real', 'closure', 'love', 'triangle.In', 'seasons', '1-3', 'have', 'mission', 'one', 'big', 'novel', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'series', 'season', '4', 'rounding', 'out', 'Season', '5', 'was', 'just', 'completely', 'different', 'more', 'Angel', 'Investigations', 'more', 'champions', 'more', 'fighting', 'redemption', 'help', 'helpless', 'more', 'working', 'for/with', 'powers', 'be', 'none', 'things', 'made', 'series', 'series', 'EVERYTHING', 'gone', 'everyone', 'personality', 'changes', 'die', 'watched', 'Gone', 'Wind', 'everyone', 'know', 'what', 'next', 'then', 'years', 'author', 'women', 'rights', 'relative', 'author', 'do', 'sequel', 'horrible', 'change', 'Scarlett', 'Rhett', 'personalites', 'have', 'doing', 'things', 'characters', 'would', 'never', 'do', 'acting', 'ways', 'characters', 'would', 'never', 'act', 'just', 'so', 'badly', 'ruined', 'story', 'wished', ""'d"", 'never', 'even', 'seen', 'what', 'do', 'characters', 'season', '5', 'continuing', 'Buffy', 'Angel', 'series', 'hated', 'fact', 'Spike', 'died', 'end', 'season', '7', 'Buffy', 'knew', ""'d"", 'butcher', 'character', 'season', '5', 'Angel', 'would', ""'ve"", 'just', 'rathered', 'kept', 'way', 'was', 'ended', 'Angel', 'series', 'season', '3', '4.I', 'think', 'people', 'excited', 'Spike', 'are', 'just', 'so', 'excited', 'back', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'realize', 'not', 'same', 'character', 'anymore', 'Also', 'fans', 'Cordy', 'probably', 'wont', 'season', '5', 'will', 'probably', 'feel', 'energy', 'missing', 'not', 'having', 'character', 'Angel', 'character', 'also', 'drastically', 'not', 'having', 'around', 'mentioned', 'earlier', 'Gunn', 'character', 'totally', 'changes', 'so', 'fans', 'Gunn', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'like', 'new', 'Gunn', 'etc', 'etc.The', 'point', 'ramblings', 'season', 'really', 'should', 'not', 'have', 'even', 'happened', 'ending', 'sucks', 'got', '2', 'points', 'only', 'Illyria', 'character', 'was', 'cool', 'ended', 'Connor', 'Angel', 'really', 'nicely', 'opinion']",N/A

867217,ALLJT7S5QOFFZ,B0006GAO54,kaduzy,"[6, 7]","It took me months after watching Season Five of what has now become one of my all-time favorite shows before I could decide how I truly felt about it and submit my final review.  In order to better understand this season, I watched every single episode from start to finish, putting each one under the microscope in order to establish a context by which to judge what turned out to be the final season.It was exactly the right choice.  I discovered that the producers have been leading up to the final moments of Season Five almost from the beginning, perhaps without even realizing it.  I think it's highly likely that Angel would have ended in a similar fashion no matter how many more seasons it lasted.Let's start with Season Two, epidode 12: ""Blood Money"".  In it, we first find out why the Senior Partners don't want Angel killed outright.  As Lilah and Lindsey angrily demanded they be allowed to do just that, Wolfram and Hart senior associate Nathan Reed explained that Angel was needed because he was meant to be a valuable player in the Apocalypse -- they just didn't know what side.  In order to get him on their side, they not only keep him alive, they even help him occasionally.  As a whole, Wolfram and Hart was the best villain possible for this TV show.  It had deep, deep motives stretching forward and back for thousands of years and was never just a garden-variety monster of the week villain.Season Two, episode 16: ""Epiphany"".  In what would wind up being her final appearance, Kate Lockley comes to the hotel to thank Angel for saving her life.  As they discuss what happened, he says what might as well have become his motto for Season Five: there is no final goal or solution.  In order to make the world a better place, you have to do small things, one step at a time.  You just have to keep fighting.Season Two, episode 18: ""Dead End"".  On his way out of town, Lindsey gives Angel some valuable advice on how to play Wolfram and Hart.  ""Get them to play your game.  Don't play theirs.""  Angel doesn't seem to remember this advice until it's almost too late, but hearing these words come out of Lindsey's mouth after seeing everything that will eventually happen gives them a resonance that's almost haunting.  Even more haunting is Lorne's obvious affection for Lindsey in this episode.  As he enthusiastically enjoys Lindsey's comeback performance at Caritas, it's chilling to realize that in just three short years, he will be Lindsey's executioner.Season Three, episode 5: ""Fredless"".  Winifred Burkle: ""I think I know where I'll end up.""  These simple, sweet words seem all the more tragic once one realizes that Fred never saw Illyria coming.Season Three, episode 7: ""Offspring"".  Lorne: ""I like her so much.""  He's talking about Fred.  And in this simple, loving statement, we can see the beginnings of Lorne's downward spiral once he loses the girl he liked so much.Season Four, episode 8: ""Habeus Corpses"".  Lilah's ""black and grey"" speech is one of the best-written things on this show, of any season, and this episode is a stand-out for many reasons.  But her concise summation of good vs. evil has far-reaching consequences for every single member of team Angel.  This show has always insisted that pure good and pure evil don't exist.  Every single one of these characters comes in varying shades of grey.  Knowing this as you watch them face utter darkness in that alley allows them to suddenly shine as glorious white knights fighting the blackest of all evils, even though they know that it won't make them pure again.  This particularly true of Angel and Spike.  In Season Five, Episode 4: ""Hell Bound"", they acknowledge to one another that no matter how much good they do in the world, they are both going to Hell as punishment for the all the evil they did in the past.  In spite of this realization, they are prepared to fight to the death in that alley, knowing full well what the real cost of battle will be: an eternity of suffering.  And still, they do not walk away.Season Four, episode 17: ""Inside Out"".  ""The final score can't be rigged.  I don't care how many players you grease.  That last shot always comes up a question mark.  But here's the thing: you never know when you're taking it.  It could be when you're duking it out with the Legion of Doom, or just crossing the street deciding where to have brunch.  So just treat it like it was all up to you, the world in the balance.  'Cuz you never know when it is.""  There's the whole theme of Season Five, wrapped up in a nutshell.  Maybe the whole theme of the whole show.  And in the mouth of the most unlikely character of all: Charles Gunn.  We never knew when the final score was coming; we were never supposed to know.  The characters didn't know.  Heck, the writers and producers probably didn't even know at the time this episode was written.  But that's why the fifth season ended the way it did, with the final score coming while they *literally* fought the Legion of Doom.  With the heroes, having been manipulated into playing Wolfram and Hart's game, putting some definite punctuation on the final shot.  Make no mistake, it's still a question mark.  But it's a mark of Angel's own making, one he chose for himself and one to which all of his loyal friends followed him.A sixth season would have been nice, as would a seventh.  An ending where Angel fulfills the prophesy and becomes human would have been phenomenal.  Seeing how Illyria fit into the group would have been lovely.  And seeing Angel and Spike continue to bicker even as they fight side by side reliving the old days as vampires with souls in search of atonement?  Priceless.  (And of course never getting a chance to have Sarah Michelle Gellar guest star was a real let down; ""The Girl In Question"" is one of the weakest episodes in this season.)  It's too bad that none of this could come to pass.  But as far as I'm concerned, I'm not just settling for the ending I got.  I truly believe that Angel ended the only way it really could end -- with a fight against evil that never ends, because evil never ends.  As a recently deceased Holland Manners demonstrated for Angel in Season Two, episode 15: ""Reprise"", evil is rooted in humanity, which is why it will always continue, no matter how hard you fight.  But as Angel realized in his own epiphany, ending it isn't the point.  All you can do is keep fighting against it, as long as it continues to exist.  Since it will always exist, you can never stop fighting.  All you can do is go to work.That's what ""Angel"" did.  And for five nearly flawless seasons, it worked hard, and worked perfectly.  (Apart from the last half of Season 4, but let's not dwell on that.)  Whether or not they survived that final battle, they kept working against evil, to the last breaths in their bodies.  Add to that the excellent stand-alone episodes like the hilariously bizarre ""Smile Time"" and the four-hanky weeper ""A Hole In The World"" (Angel is only the second TV show to ever move me to tears.  Man, I sobbed like a baby when Fred and then Wesley died in one another's arms.) and you've got one of the best seasons of this show.  Pair that with an ending for the ages, and it's not just television -- it's Angel.  And it's still a miracle to me.",5,An Angel gets its wings,1186185600,"08 4, 2007",2007,7272,"['took', 'months', 'watching', 'Season', 'Five', 'what', 'now', 'become', 'one', 'all-time', 'favorite',

That sequence of events leads to an exploration of what being ""human"" really means and how much a nonhuman can fathom the ""pitiable"" (Illyria's view) world of human emotion and weakness.I bought this set for one reason - a fascination with Illyria, Wesley and Fred and the dynamic of that trio.

While most reviewers here on Amazzon.com really seem to have enjoyed it, I'm quite disappointed with the ending of the series. Oh, believe me, the season does have its good moments. I think I just miss the good old days of Buffy and Angel. One of the things that bugs me is the last episode and how it ended. I guess that the studios really weren't going to give Joss and the others any chance to leave Angel as it should have, like Joss was able to do with the Buffy-Verse. I just felt like a lot of the characters were rather out-of-character.Does no one even remember Buffy now? It almost seemed like Joss's creative team was taking old storylines from Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Smile Time reminded me way too much of one of Buffy's earlier episodes, The Puppet Show.  However, I might just be getting picky here. I can't imagine how difficult it would be to try and keep up a show like 'Angel' and always keep it original. The Angel team did a great job. I'm just much more of a Buffy fan then an Angel fan.What really irritated me though, was how all of the leading male characters started to fall for Winifred (Fred).  Okay, now seriously. What was that all about? Do you honestly think that Spike and Fred would look good together? Or Angel and Fred? I really don't like what they did to Lorne's character either. He was one of my favorite original characters in the Angel-verse and again, why the heck did all of the guys have to fall in love with Fred? They should have put in some new blood in the show or something to spice it up.I have a lot of respect for Joss Whedon though. I mean, I really do. I just  wish that Angel had ended differently is all. I mean, turning Lorne into a  killer was a bit too much for me. It was as if the creative team on the show didn't really know what to do with Lorne and so they had to have him kill somebody.Or maybe it's just the fact that I don't like to see Lorne sad.Again, the whole season wasn't terrible. I just wish that they had made some other choices storyline-wise.

It's completely impossible to be anything but extremely pleased with this purchase as well as the rest of the series. The writing, acting , directing, etc... are amazing per usual. This is without question once again feature film quality.The fact that all but the first season is filmed in Letter Box gives it that theater feel. In addition, the closed-captioning is less likely to interfere with the picture. David Boreanaz (Angel) and James Marsters (Spike) are brilliant in their performances together as well as with other cast members. I must credit Alexis Denisof (Wes), Andy Hallet (Lorne) and Amy Acker (Fred and Illyria) gives a wonderful performance playing two different characters. Joss Whedon comes through once again. I not only highly recommend this Season disk set, but the other four seasons as well, for Charisma Carpenter (Cordelia) was amazing in her portrayal of the good Cordy, seen in many different incarnations throughout the years. She is sincerely missed in season five. Lucky for us she returns for the 100th episode titled ""You're Welcome"" when she comes back to wrap up her story line. She never looked more beautiful and did some of her finest work in that one show. Any true Angel fan must complete their set with this one. It's a keeper folks. Purchase this before it gets sold out and you miss your chance to finalize your collection.

The relationship between Angel and Spike is so explosive it is hard not to choose sides.  The last battle... well, it has to be seen.  I keep hoping that Mr. Whedon will give us a movie or mini series, something that will continue this fantastic story.

867227,A2S9P70216QC2H,B0006GAO54,"lenzino7383 ""BigBlue""","[1, 1]","A season full of changes, death and many farewells, Angel's fifth and final year is not only a great season, but the perfect send off to this wonderful series. Now as the new owners of L.A.'s Wolfram and Hart branch, Angel and the gang have a vast supply of facilities, weapons, workers and resources to help them fight the forces of evil. Not to mention, Spike mysteriously returns and becomes a pivotal part of the team. But where the fight truly lies is within Wolfram and Hart as Angel and the gang try to use the once evil empire as a force of good, but throughout the year, they will find that they are being corrupted by their new found power and it will cost them not only their very own lives but will set into motion THE Apocalypse they might not win. Here's Season 5:Conviction-Pretty good episode! ""As Angel and the gang adjust to being the new owners of Wolfram and Hart, Angel must stop his latest client who has hid a mystical bomb that could wipe out all of California."" The whole cast acts well in their new setting even though the plot could have been better. Harmony returns and Eve is introduced.Just Rewards-Weak episode!! ""Spike mysteriously returns from the amulet that Angel gave to Buffy and immediately becomes a pain in Angel's side, just as Angel must stop an evil Necromancer."" James Masters is a wonderful new addition to the cast and is hilarious as Spike as he interacts with the cast. I wish the plot was better though.Unleashed-Weak episode!! ""Just as Angel and the gang help Nina, a young woman recently turned into a werewolf; deal with her new situation, a man plans to serve Nina as the main course at his formal gathering."" Nina is a good character that gets some good development, but I never liked her relationship with Angel.Hell Bound-Great episode!! ""Fred and the gang struggle to help Spike when Pavayne, The Reaper is after him and tries to force him into hell."" A creepy and disturbing episode as Pavayne was a great villain and the haunting scenes were wonderful.Life of the Party-Weak Episode!! ""After giving his sleep away to Wolfram and Hart, Lorne,unknowingly forces everyone to do whatever he says, leading to some outrageous hijnks and his mind manifesting."" While there were some funny moments, the whole episode is pointless filler.The Cautionary Tale of Numero Cinco-Bad Episode!! ""Angel asks for the help of Numero Cinco, a member of The Luchadors; a group of demon fighting Mexican wrestlers when an Aztec demon is on a rampage."" One of the worst episodes of Angel's run, just boring, corny and forgettable!Lineage-Great episode!! ""Just as Wesley struggles to get along with his father when he stops by for a visit, a group of cyborg assassins attack Wolfram and Hart as they plan to still Angel's will."" Wesley gets some amazing development here and the scene where he shoots his father is very shocking!Destiny-Great episode!! ""When Spike is mysteriously re-corporealized by another strange package in the mail, Angel and Spike must battle for an ancient cup to stop the world from being thrown into chaos."" David Boreanaz and James Masters are great as both Spike and Angel battle to the death for the cup. Also, the flashbacks with Drusilla were great. Lindsey returns as well and is working with Eve!Harm's Way-Great episode!! ""After a one night stand with a guy, Harmony awakes to find out she might have killed him. Thinking she was framed, Harmony investigates and tries to stop anyone from finding out."" Harmony is so hilarious here, especially when she keeps knocking people out. Also, the demon clan was funny, lol.Soul Purpose-Great episode!! ""While Eve traps Angel in his nightmares of failure to Spike, Lindsey takes on the persona of Doyle and guides Spike to the innocents of L.A."" The dream sequences were top notch and show David is an effective director. The Spike/Lindsey scenes were also good. I liked how Eve gets busted at the end.Damage-Great episode!! ""When Angel discovers that a recent escapee from a mental ward, Dana, is a vampire slayer, he gets the help of watcher-in-training Andrew to help just as Spike tracks down Dana."" A very dark and impressive episode as Dana is a great character. I loved the torture scenes with Spike and the hilarious scenes with Andrew. The last scene is also very touching.You're Welcome-Incredible episode!! ""When Cordelia finally wakes up from her coma, she is shocked to find Angel and the gang are in control of Wolfram and Hart and plans to get Angel back on track just as Lindsey makes his move to defeat Angel once and for all."" Charimsa Carpenter makes her final appearance as this episode is full of so many amazing moments like Cordelia guiding Angel, the hilarious dialogue, the fight scene with Lindsey and the sad conclusion as Cordelia says goodbye.Why We Fight-Weak episode!! ""Lawson, a mysterious man from Angel's past, returns to seek vengeance on Angel by taking the gang hostage just as Angel recalls during World War 2 when he was sent to save Lawson and his crew underwater."" A slow, boring episode with a boring villain and horrible conclusion.  Although, Spike being a Nazi was hilarious!Smile Time-Amazing episode!! ""After a series of children falling into bizarre comas after watching a TV show called ""Smile Time"", Angel investigates at the show's studio only to be turned into a puppet mistakenly."" One of the funniest episodes of Angel that's full of hilarious dialogue, great scenes and unforgettable moments. Watching the gang fighting the puppets was too priceless!A Hole in the World-Incredible episode!! ""After being exposed to some dust from an ancient sarcophagus, Fred begins to slowly die as Angel and the rest of the gang go to extreme lengths to save her."" A powerful episode that has tremendous acting, shocking revelations and an ending so moving that you are lost for words. Alexis Denisof and Amy Acker give their best performances yet!Shells-Incredible episode!! ""Illyria, the parasite that slowly killed Fred, takes over her body and plans to take back the world she has conquered a millennia ago as a God King, just as Angel and Spike return to stop her and Wesley's grief causes him to go on a rampage."" Just as powerful as the last episode, Illyria is a wonderful character/villain and her power display is amazing to watch. The ending is also the saddest scene in Angel history.Underneath-Great episode!! ""After losing Fred, Angel along with Spike and Gunn, decide to find Lindsey for some information which leads them to a bizarre hell dimension where the Senior Partners put him in."" The hell dimension was very impressive as it seems like a perfect world but isn't. I loved the introduction of Hamilton and the revelations of the upcoming apocalypse. Also, the Wesley/Illyria scenes were amazing.Origin-Great episode!! ""Angel is shocked to find his son, Connor, has returned. Finally agreeing to take the case, Angel helps Connor and prepares him for a fight against Sahjan."" Connor returns and has a great new personality. I loved his meeting with Illyria and the fight scene against Sahjan was great as well.Time Bomb-Great episode!! ""When Illryia's powers become unstable and cause her to jump through time, Angel and the gang plan to kill her just as Illyria plans kill them herself."" Loved the time loop scenes and the scene when Illryia kills the whole gang in like 5 seconds! The character also gets some good development.The Girl In Question-Weak episode!! ""When Angel and Spike find out their old nemesis, The Immortal is with Buffy in Rome, they go there to stop him while Illyria takes the form of Fred when her parents visit."" While the Immortal plot was lame, the sub-plot with Illryia's interaction with her parents was sad yet great to watch.Power Play-Amazing episode!! ""The gang is worried that Angel has been corrupt by Wolfram and Hart when Drogyn returns and Angel joins the evil organization, Circle of the Black Throne."" A dark and fantastic episode as it sets up for the finale so well. The fight between Illyria and Hamilton was great and the final scene is moving.No Fade Away-The Last episode!! ""Angel and the gang live the day like it's their last as they prepare for the final fight against the Senior Partners when they plan to destroy the Circle of the Black Thorn."" An incredibly perfect and epic finale as the whole cast does so well until their finale moments. From Wesley's death, to the scenes between Angel and Conner, to the last moments of the series...its stands true to what the show was all about.Angel's final season is one of the best seasons of the whole Buffyverse as there is a wonderful collection of some of the saddest and funniest episodes ever produced on TV. It's very sad that a series beyond it's time like Angel was cut short after just 5 seasons, but its legacy of fascinating writing, captivating storylines, strong acting and talented writers will live on. The DVD boxset has some great extras like hilarious bloopers as well as a special with Joss Whedon talking about the best episodes of Angel and an overview of the last season.",5,In the Belly of the

I bought Angel Seasons 4 and 5 from the same seller and once I received them, I re-watched the series from beginning to end. Even though money is tight and it isn't responsible to spend money on DVD's, It was a great deal... $15 dollars for two seasons before tax and shipping. Wow, that is a great deal! I have no regret or buyer's remorse for purchasing these two DVD's. I will definitely watch this series over and over again. However, I was not entirely happy with this product and I am not sure if I will go through this seller again. For purchasing a new DVD, I expected better quality. When I took off the packaging, I noticed the case was broken. When I opened the case, pieces of the case fell out. The side of the case is broken. I am not sure if that happened during shipping, so I don't hold it against the seller. Season 4 also had this problem (so I just copied from that review).

For 4 seasons Angel and his band of good and semi good guys fought the forces of Wolfram and Hart. The evil law firm was always around causing assorted amounts of trouble. An apocalpyse here and apocalypse there but even evil law firms headed by mysterious powerful demons have their limits. They were sick of trying to defeat Angel and decided at the end of season 4 to offer Angel the reigns to their LA Branch of the firm. With all that power at his disposal Angel could do a lot of good. Resources and power like that could really help Angel defeat the forces of darkness.The catch is that he would be joining Wolfram and Hart. Would the power corrupt him? Could he and the gang trust W&H;? Can you really affect change from the inside or do you inevitably become an insider yourself?Angel embarks on this journey with his gang and to add to his migraines he has a new ""buddy"". His long time foil Spike has migrated to LA and has made it his mission to annoy, subvert, and supplant Angel at every turn. The interaction b/w the two ranges from comedic genius, to touching sibling rivalry, to violent rage. The rich history between them makes for great moments.The other star of the show is just simply Wolfram and Hart. Only in the Whedonverse is an evil law firm bent on world destruction this funny and irreverant. The rapid fire switches from laugh out loud funny to unbelievably spooky is a Whedon trademark and season 5 of Angel is no exception. W&H; go from scary to funny and back again multiple times.I don't want to ruin it but this season has one of my top 3 saddest moments the show ever produced. It is a scene that is so mind blowingly bitter and tragic that I just had to smile at how cruel the writers were to us and the characters. It shouldn't have ended here but it gets a great send off nonetheless. Well worth a buy even if you haven't watched the first 4 seasons.

It was very promising in the beginning, and it had some fine ideas, though some of these ideas didn't quite stretch through an entire season.This fifth season did not seem to have much of a unifying story arc for the season as a whole, aside from winding down the series.  Instead, it had a series of smaller arcs that happened around the same time.  Yes, there's the vague overlord company Wolfram and Hart who we never really meet except through their various emissaries, and a new omni-powerful underground group that nobody can beat, not even our team, except, well, no spoilers.  And a new ancient god rising to take over the world, again, but a different one.Angel himself seemed bored, most definitely going through the motions.  Spike was at his Spikiest, which was generally fun though a bit predictable.  They fought like an old couple.  The least predictable was Fred, who got a total makeover in one story arc.  For the fans, they managed to parade in most of the key characters involved in the past, even sort of Buffy, though not the actual actress herself, to make appearances and sometimes have a role in the story.I sat through it to see how they would work it all out.

867239,A1LF5XT1MOUFEZ,B0006GAO54,"Martin Miller ""marty party""","[8, 10]","I just finished the final season of Angel last night, and I must say that it is indeed a mixed bag. It is very easy for one to see why the show was canceled during this season. Of course, this is largely in blame to the WB who had the producers make each episode a free standing episode. This definately hurt ""Angel"" quite a bit. The show was known in its previous seasons for building on past episodes and this new style did not compliment the show.When I say this season is a mixed bag I mean this....When the writers got it right....they hit a HOME RUN! When they did not get it right, they pretty much failed. I found some of these episodes to be stupid, dull, and pretty much a waste of time. However, that only accounts for a very few of the episodes. The majority were fantastic!!!! In particular the episode entitled ""Your Welcome."" This episode features the return of Charisma Carpenter as Cordelia Chase. In this episode, Cordelia returns to help Angel one final time and remind him why he fights the good fight. To me, this particular episode shined as the best of any other episode of ""Angel"" and even ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer."" The pay off is huge, shocking, and most of all a tear jerker. When I say tear jerker I do mean crying like a baby.Angel's fifth season also features quite a few pay offs for fans of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer."" The fifth season of Angel takes place a few months after the seventh season of Buffy. It features Andrew, a character from Buffy in two hilarious episodes and gives us a little more resolution about what all the characters from Buffy are doing. These two episodes are entitled, ""Damage,"" and ""The Girl in Question."" The girl in question actually revolves quite a bit around Buffy and what she is doing post-slayerhood. Angel and Spike travel to Italy to save Buffy from the Immortal, a guy whom it turns out she's actually dating. I found the episode to be quite funny and offered a tad bit of resolution to the Angel/Buffy/Spike love triangle. Sarah Michlle Geller is not actually in the episode, but somehow it still works. In the end I must say it is still pretty apparent to me that Buffy will eventually end up with Angel.Which brings us to Spike....I do not believe that Spike was well utalized at all. For the first few episodes he's just kinda wandering around the office doing very little. Later when he is finally turned into human form he still sticks out like a sore thumb as part of the Angel crowd. James Marsters and David Boreanaz have fantastic chemistry together, but for some reason Spike just never really fit into the season until the last few episodes.Next, there is Mercedes McNab who plays Harmony. Harmony returns this season as Angel's assistant at Wolfram and Hart. I loved Mcnab this season. She did a excellent job of playing the comic relief. The Chemistry was still there between Harmony and Spike as was the case with previous seasons of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer."" Yet again though, I believe that she was under utilized on ""Angel."" She did have a fantastic episode entitled, ""Harm's Way."" The episode did little to move along the storyline of the series, but was quite fun to watch. Ultimately I have to disagree with the route that the writers took Haromny on in the end, but I understand why they did it, but I was still quite dissapointed....I guess that was the idea.Gunn for the majority of this season is just kinda there, along with Lorne. Gunn did things that were very out of character and yet again I disagree with the route that the writers chose to take with his character. As far as Lorne goes, he was just kinda hanging around with the exception of a episode that was devoted to him called, ""Life of the Party."" This was yet another one of those episodes that we could have done without in lew of a episode that furthered the storylines of this season.The real tale to tell, other than the return of Cordelia (Can't say enough about that episode), was the story of Fred and Welsey. For three seasons the writers dragged there story out to the point that it was nearly painful, and finally we get the pay off...Wesley and Fred get together. The problem is that we only get to see this for two episodes, and their relationship seemed to be the most rushed in the history of Buffy and Angel. Shortly after the couple gets together, Fred dies and this brings about the demon who posses her body, Illyria. You have to tip your hat to Amy Acker who showed true diversity and talent by playing both the characters of Fred and Illyria. Illyira is one of my favorite characters of the Buffyverse. She has the bluntness of Cordelia, the non-caring attitude of Spike, and the power of  Glory, truly a marvelous character. The relationship that Wesley has with Illyria is quite interesting to watch.....its kind of like a train wreck that you just can't take your eyes off of.Now the end......In the end of the series Angel has leveraged himself into a full out final battle with Wolfram and Hart. It is a battle he believes he and that gang will not survive. For all I know he's half right. Several of the characters do not make it through and it is quite sad to see. I felt that the end of the series was quite rushed! I understand how this could have happened, with Whedon and the gang finding out not far in advance that they needed to wrap up the storylines, but the problem is that they didn't. Angel does not really end, it just cutts off abruptly. I don't quite agree with some of the choices made either, one being what happened to Lindsey, it just didn't make a lot of sense to me. As far as Conner's return went in the final episode, it was quite nice, but again rushed. I feel the same way about the episode where he makes his actual return ""Origin."" It was nice to see him as a somewhat normal and not coo coo crazy kid. The quote Angel makes to him in the last ten minutes of the show about the fact that Connor exsists he does was quite great!As far as someone enjoying the way the show ended or not is kind of a decision you have to make personally. If you believe the battle against evil never ends and that's how the show should have ended, then you will find this ending fitting, but it did little for me personally. I devoted myself to watching this show from start to finish and I'd have to say I felt a little gipped. I felt like I deserved a little more of a concrete ending, like what I got with Buffy. The rumors that i've heard are that there will be tv movies, but here we are a couple of years later and nothing....at least yet....  I hope that this changes. We the fans want more! Or at least a good ending, enough so that we know who survived. My guess would be Spike, Angel, and Illyria.Overall, this is a season that all Angel and even Buffy fans should see. This season features enough Buffy alums and mentions Buffy enough to keep a Buffy fan engaged, and for Angel fans it is the final piece of the puzzle.",4,A mixed bag for the final season of

867241,A331OF34UX4Y1K,B0006GAO54,"M. Fonseca ""carmarthen""","[4, 5]","Well, I just got to take if off my chest, so I'll explain the reasons I gave only two stars to the fifth season of this great, amazing, funny, emotional and breathtaking show. Let's begin. (spoils below)1) Even this being my least favorite season, it's still miles better than the competition.2) It's hard to say this, but, for the first time, I think the executive sharks that run the studios made the right decision by cancelling ANGEL.(even if there was nothing better to replace it). At least they did that before the show jumped the shark, where it was the way to go. Why? Without Buffy, without crossovers allowed, Angel became only a half of the Buffyverse, and it was hard to stand on its own for more seasons.3) So, let's see why this season dissapointed me so much. Sure, this is a ""dark show"", with humor and evertyhting, but the core concept always was: bad things are everywhere and we have to fight against it. Therefore, I'm all favorable to ""the fight never stops"" concept. I just don't know when exactly the producers knew the show was going to be cancelled. But I think Joss Whedon became really annoyed by that and was caught unaware, so he became angry and decided to blow things up. Why to make things SO DARK in the end? I just don't understand. In the preceding seasons, it was established that Wolfram & Hart were really, really powerful. But, in Season Five, things escalated to the point that they said: Wolfram & Hart (The Senior Partners) is simply unbeatable. They will never disappear. They are eternal, because mankind is weak. So, our heroes go on a suicidal mission where Whedon decided do kill EVERYBODY. They made clear Angel had no chance whatever of ever becoming human again (by singing the original Shanshu Prophecy presented to him by the Black Thorn). They killed Wesley's love (Fred) one episode after they finally get together. Ok, this makes good TV, all of the deaths were tear-jerking exercises (at least to myself), but it was the total opposite of Buffy's final episode, where some characters died, but the overall tone was one of relief and some kind of good future for the characters. Other than that, by making it clear that the Senior Partners will never die, that evil will always be around IN FORCE, this was contracditory to the Buffyverse in a way. What way? (explanation below)4) Well, if the Senior Partners and their power will endure forever, what did The Scooby Gang accomplished in Sunnydale? Apparently, nothing more than closing a ""simple"" and ""generic"" Hellmouth. Let's say, a second-league feat. So, using logic dedution, something horribly happened to Buffy`s characters. Because, since the Apocalypse (THE apocalypse, not A apocalypse)was coming and Angel realized he had not the power to confront them indefinitely, how could the Scoobies be happily living in Brazil, Rome, Britain and Africa, without helping AT ALL?? This is the point that annoyed me the most. Remembering what I wrote above: if the Senior Partners are going to reign supreme forever, what Buffy acomplished in Sunnydale was nothing and the Scoobies simply gave up helping ""fighting the good fight"".5) As for the ""double meaning"" ending, if some of you thing there are two options (they survived or not), there is no such thing: it was meant to kill them all. Come on, a dragon and a giant amongst an army of orcs. The only hope is that Jeffrey Bell, on the commentary track , says that ""come on it was Angel, maybe he could survive"", but that the point was to show them fighting forever. I just think it was taken straight from ""Butchie Cassidy"". I simply was shocked to see the characters I followed through five seasons to be killed in basically just one episode. I repeat, I think it was revenge by Whedon. ""Ok, you cancel my show, I will kill them all"". Differently from Buffy, where basically they all knew, before Season Seven, that Sarah was not gonna sign for another season, and Joss was tired of running two highly difficult shows in terms of complex writing, scenarios, special effects, etc.6) Of course, there are good moments. Stand alone episodes like ""SMILE TIME"" and ""WHY WE FIGHT were good.I have nothing against the clever move of bringing probably the most dear character from Buffy (Spike)to Angel. Bringing back Harmony as comic relief was also a good move.I repeat, my main concern was the absurd quantity of darkness put in the final episodes of this season.",2,Don't crucify me by rating it two stars!,1190505600,"09 23, 2007",2007,4420,"['Well', 'just', 'got', 'take', 'off', 'chest', ""'ll"", 'explain', 'reasons', 'gave', 'only', 'two', 'stars', 'fifth', 'season', 'great', 'amazing', 'funny', 'emotional', 'breathtaking', 'show', 'Let', 'begin', 'spoils', '1', 'Even', 'being', 'least', 'favorite', 'season', 'still', 'miles', 'better', 'competition.2', 'hard', 'say', 'first', 'time', 'think', 'executive', 'run', 'studios', 'made', 'right', 'decision', 'cancelling', 'ANGEL', 'even', 'was', 'nothing', 'better', 'replace', 'least', 'did', 'show', 'jumped', 'shark', 'where', 'was', 'way', 'go', 'Why', 'Buffy', 'crossovers', 'allowed', 'Angel', 'became', 'only', 'half', 'Buffyverse', 'was', 'hard', 'stand', 'own', 'more', 'seasons.3', 'So', 'let', 'see', 'why', 'season', 'dissapointed', 'so', 'much', 'Sure', 'dark', 'show', 'humor', 'evertyhting', 'core', 'concept', 'always', 'was', 'bad', 'things', 'are', 'everywhere', 'have', 'fight', 'Therefore', ""'m"", 'favorable', 'fight', 'never', 'concept', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'when', 'exactly', 'producers', 'knew', 'show', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'cancelled', 'think', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'became', 'really', 'annoyed', 'was', 'caught', 'unaware', 'so', 'became', 'angry', 'decided', 'blow', 'things', 'up', 'Why', 'make', 'things', 'SO', 'DARK', 'end', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'preceding', 'seasons', 'was', 'established', 'Wolfram', 'Hart', 'were', 'really', 'really', 'powerful', 'Season', 'Five', 'things', 'escalated', 'point', 'said', 'Wolfram', 'Hart', 'Senior', 'Partners', 'simply', 'unbeatable', 'will', 'never', 'disappear', 'are', 'eternal', 'mankind', 'weak', 'So', 'heroes', 'go', 'suicidal', 'mission', 'where', 'Whedon', 'decided', 'do', 'kill', 'EVERYBODY', 'made', 'clear', 'Angel', 'had', 'chance', 'whatever', 'ever', 'becoming', 'human', 'again', 'singing', 'original', 'Shanshu', 'Prophecy', 'presented', 'Black', 'Thorn', 'killed', 'Wesley', 'love', 'Fred', 'one', 'episode', 'finally', 'get', 'together', 'Ok', 'good', 'TV', 'deaths', 'were', 'tear-jerking', 'exercises', 'least', 'was', 'total', 'opposite', 'Buffy', 'final', 'episode', 'where', 'characters', 'died', 'overall', 'tone', 'was', 'one', 'relief', 'kind', 'good', 'future', 'characters', 'Other', 'making', 'clear', 'Senior', 'Partners', 'will', 'never', 'die', 'evil', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'around', 'IN', 'FORCE', 'was', 'contracditory', 'Buffyverse', 'way', 'What', 'way', 'explanation', '4', 'Well', 'Senior', 'Partners', 'power', 'will', 'endure', 'forever', 'what', 'did', 'Scooby', 'Gang', 'accomplished', 'Sunnydale', 'Apparently', 'nothing', 'more', 'closing', 'simple', 'generic', 'Hellmouth', 'Let', 'say', 'second-league', 'feat', 'So', 'using', 'logic', 'dedution', 'something', 'horribly', 'happened', 'Buffy', 's', 'characters', 'Apocalypse', 'THE', 'apocalypse', 'not', 'A', 'apocalypse', 'was', 'coming', 'Angel', 'realized', 'had', 'not', 'power', 'confront', 'indefinitely', 'how', 'could', 'Scoobies', 'be', 'happily', 'living', 'Brazil', 'Rome', 'Britain', 'Africa', 'helping', 'AT', 'ALL', 'point', 'annoyed', 'most', 'Remembering', 'what', 'wrote', 'Senior', 'Partners', 'are', 'going', 'reign', 'supreme', 'forever', 'what', 'Buffy', 'acomplished', 'Sunnydale', 'was', 'nothing', 'Scoobies', 'simply', 'gave', 'up', 'helping', 'fighting', 'good', 'fight', '.5', 'double', 'meaning', 'ending', 'thing', 'are', 'two', 'options', 'survived', 'not', 'such', 'thing', 'was', 'meant', 'kill', 'Come', 'dragon', 'giant', 'amongst', 'army', 'orcs', 'only', 'hope', 'Jeffrey', 'Bell', 'commentary', 'track', 'come', 'was', 'Angel', 'maybe', 'could', 'survive', 'point', 'was', 'show', 'fighting', 'forever', 'just', 'think', 'was', 'taken', 'straight', 'Butchie', 'Cassidy', 'simply', 'was', 'shocked', 'see', 'characters', 'followed', 'five', 'seasons', 'be', 'killed', 'basically', 'just', 'one', 'episode', 'repeat', 'think', 'was', 'revenge', 'Whedon', 'Ok', 'cancel', 'show', 'will', 'kill', 'Differently', 'Buffy', 'where', 'basically', 'knew', 'Season', 'Seven', 'Sarah', 'was', 'not', 'gon', 'sign', 'season', 'Joss', 'was', 'tired', 'running', 'two', 'highly', 'difficult', 'shows', 'terms', 'complex', 'writing', 'scenarios', 'special', 'effects', 'etc.6', 'course', 'are', 'good', 'moments', 'Stand', 'alone', 'SMILE', 'TIME', 'WHY', 'WE', 'FIGHT', 'were', 'good.I', 'have', 'nothing', 'clever', 'move', 'bringing', 'probably', 'most', 'dear', 'character', 'Buffy', 'Spike', 'Angel', 'Bringing', 'back', 'Harmony', 'comic', 'relief', 'was', 'also', 'good', 'move.I', 'repeat', 'main', 'concern', 'was', 'absurd', 'quantity', 'darkness', 'put', 'final', 'episodes', 'season']",N/A

Mora ""Bad Wolf""","[4, 9]","I was really concerned when they changed the locale of the show to Wolfram and Hart in order to make the show a bit easier for Non Angel viewers to like. The first half of the season my fears were warranted. They dumbed it down, made it funnier and had the characters standing around the office a lot and talking. The supporting cast had almost nothing to do and what we were used to, the arcs and dark themed Angel were gone. But half way through the season, they got their act together and fixed what was broken. In essence we got our show back and even with the first half lacking, the second half of the season makes up for it and makes the entire season worth buying.There's some amazing stories in the latter half and some tragic stuff that happens that I won't give a way but it's as good as anything done on Angel.Boy am I going to miss this show (already do) and it's sad to think that the WB cancelled the show for some lackluster stuff that is on now.

August Richards). Angel has a secretary, the return of Harmony Kendall (Mercedes McNab) and the most satisfying of returns, the ressurection of the bad boy vampire himself, Spike (James Marsters). But here's the catch, Spike is a ghost now, roaming the halls of Wolfram and Hart, annoying the piss out of Angel and Co. Angel meets a werwolf girl, Spike gets a dose from a ghost named PaVayne, Lorne loses his sleep and throws a Halloween Party, Numero Cinco tells Angel about his past, Wesley's father Roger (Roy Dotrice) comes for a visit), Spike and Angel brawl it out for the cup of torment, Lindsay McDonald (Christian Kane) is back in town and he's shacked up with Eve (Sarah Thompson), We expereience a day in the life of Harmony, Eve maks Angel hallucinate and dream weird stuff, A rogue slayer named Dana is on the loose and Andrew (Tom Lenk) strolls into town, A vision of Angel in trouble awakens Cordelia Chase (Charisma Carpenter) out of her coma leading Angel to a brawl with Lindsay. Soon after Lindsay is gone but not dead, Angel finds out Cordelia is dead. A man named Lawson strolls in wanting answers from Angel flashing back to a submarine. Angel is transformed into a puppet, A coffin of some sort arrives, Fred opens it and suddenly she is dying, which means the worst. Spike and Angel go to England, Gunn finds out that Knox (Jonathan M. Woodward) was involved and Fred dies and she turns into a blue haired, blue eyed goddess. Fred is now Illyria, Gunn is put in the hospital by Wesley, Illyria tries to summon her kingdom but cant so now she has to stick around Wolfram and Hart with Wesley watching over her. Angel, Spike and Gunn go to another dimension to bring back Lindsay, Wesley babysits Illyria while some evil roams around Wolfram and Hart looking for Eve, Gunn is left behind, Angel's supposed son left behind Connor (Vincent Kartheiser) comes back, Connor has to destroy the Sajhjan (Jack Conley), Wesley reveals the past and Angel finds out Connor knows about that past. Illyria is on the brink of blowing up, Wesley is on the verge of going crazy, Gunn returns, everyone dies but Angel gets sucked threw time to try to not have that happen again, Illyria is drained of all her powers. Spike and Angel go to Italy because of Buffy (Sarah Michelle Gellar, but she never appears in this season) and a demon head. Along the while the 2 get into bar fights, almost get blown up and suffer the fact that Buffy loves them but they have to move on with their lives. The last two episodes invlove the following. Angel gets more and more deeper in a group called The Black Thorn in which case he had to kill Drogyn (Alec Newman), the gang confront Angel but Angel tells them about his plan to get rid of The Black Thorn. The end episode consists of the gangs final days as they take time out to do one last thing: Angel visits his son Connor, Spike gets drunk and resites poetry, Gunn visits the homeless shelter, Wesley says with Illyria, Lorne sings, Lindsay and Eve spend time with each other and Harmony has sex with the badguy, Hamilton (Adam Baldwin) telling him about Angel's plans. The gang take on the badguys, Illyria takes on a devil dude and kills him, Spike rescues a baby, Gunn takes on a political figure, Lorne and Lindsay team up but in the end Lorne kills Lindsay with a silencer and leaves town. Wesley takes on a wizard named Veil (Dennis Christopher) in which case Wesley dies (why?!!) and Illyria kills Veil out of rage. Angel takes on Hamilton with the help from his son Connor. Angel kills Hamilton in which case Wolfram and Hart collapses in, so they take off. Angel meets up with the remaining gang, Spike, a badly wounded Gunn and a pissed off Illyria. The 4 are the last standing in the fight but we dont know who survives, though Joss Whedon said in an interview that Spike did survive the battle, so that's good to know. It ends with in an unsatisfying way which really pissed me off because it should of expanded to a two hour season finale. damn the WB, I hate them. All in all the cast this season did a tremendous job in the acting ranks, with Alexis Denisof and Amy Acker showing so much love and emotion that they should of won an Emmy award or something and James Marsters was totally fascinating this season doing some of his best work though him and David Boreanaz look like they gained a few pounds, especially Boreanaz but hey, it's all good. Also there is a good mention of Glenn Quinn in this season to remember his charcter and to also remember him as well because Quinn passed away tradgicly in 2002 of a drug overdose, so I thought that was special of them to do that and it was fun to see Christian Kane doing his own version of Doyle as well. So, in conclusion...in my own little mind, Angel Season Five went out with a bang but it was a disappointing bang in which they should of had at least a 2 hour season finale.....I hate the WB...they

I hadnt watched that much in the past and had very little knowledge of the overall plot. Which is why I was so shocked by how attached I became to it when watching this season.I was fully prepared to watch James Marsters performance and let everything else take a backseat. As it turned out Spike often faded into the background, overshadowed by the already wonderful emsemble cast. The show showed a wonderful mixture of drama, comedy and horror that its sister show Buffy had a tendency to get wrong occasionally.What struck me most about this season is that it made me want to burst into tears more times than seven seasons of Buffy ever did. Episodes like ""A whole in the world"" and ""Youre welcome"" were so absolutely wonderful and tragic at the same time, that it is truly sad that this show was cancelled.The cancellatiion means that we may never see Angel get his redemption, or Spike for that matter. Or that we wont learn more about the fabulous creation that was Illyria, a baffling character that is a pleasure to watch. But we have the dvds to comfort us thankfully and we can watch the return of Cordy, the big showdown of Angel and Spike in ""Destiny"", the first appearance of Illyria in ""Shells"" and, believe it or not, a hilarious use of puppets in ""Smile Time""A classic season that was unfortunately the last.",4,Angel,1122336000,"07 26, 2005",2005,1424,"['admit', 'only', 'began', 'watching', 'Angel', 'when', 'heard', 'James', 'Marsters', 'was', 'becoming', 'regular', 'hadnt', 'watched', 'much', 'past', 'had', 'very', 'little', 'knowledge', 'overall', 'plot', 'Which', 'why', 'was', 'so', 'shocked', 'how', 'attached', 'became', 'when', 'watching', 'season.I', 'was', 'fully', 'prepared', 'watch', 'James', 'Marsters', 'performance', 'let', 'everything', 'else', 'take', 'backseat', 'turned', 'out', 'Spike', 'often', 'faded', 'background', 'overshadowed', 'already', 'wonderful', 'emsemble', 'cast', 'show', 'showed', 'wonderful', 'mixture', 'drama', 'comedy', 'horror', 'sister', 'show', 'Buffy', 'had', 'tendency', 'get', 'wrong', 'occasionally.What', 'struck', 'most', 'season', 'made', 'want', 'burst', 'tears', 'more', 'times', 'seven', 'seasons', 'Buffy', 'ever', 'did', 'Episodes', 'A', 'whole', 'world', 'Youre', 'welcome', 'were', 'so', 'absolutely', 'wonderful', 'tragic', 'same', 'time', 'truly', 'sad', 'show', 'was', 'cancelled.The', 'cancellatiion', 'may', 'never', 'see', 'Angel', 'get', 'redemption', 'Spike', 'matter', 'wont', 'learn', 'more', 'fabulous', 'creation', 'was', 'Illyria', 'baffling', 'character', 'pleasure', 'watch', 'have', 'dvds', 'comfort', 'thankfully', 'can', 'watch', 'return', 'Cordy', 'big', 'showdown', 'Angel', 'Spike', 'Destiny', 'first', 'appearance', 'Illyria', 'Shells', 'believe', 'not', 'hilarious', 'use', 'puppets', 'Smile', 'Time', 'classic', 'season', 'was', 'unfortunately', 'last']",N/A

867248,A1BBT9XLKQDV81,B0006GAO54,"N8 ""Buffy is Queen!!""","[12, 13]","Angel Season 5 is one of the most interesting seasons in television history.  Not merely because of the content of the episodes, but also because of the intense marketing done by Angel's fanbase in order to keep the WB from in essence canceling one of its highest rated shows.  The ratings for Angel season 4 were lower than the WB anticipated, so when Buffy ended, the WB was quick to snatch up Buffy's largest talent, Spike, for what became Angel's 5th and last season.  By the second half of the season, the WB announced that Angel's contract would not be renewed, much to the horror of the 5+ million Angel viewers each week, so what did we do?  We fought the damn network, bought billboard truck to save our show, had thousands of signatures, and failed anyway!Nonetheless, the remarkable competence of Angel's cast and writers shone through during season 5 even more than they had during the epic season 4.  Angel's fifth season picks up with the gang newly taking over the ""evil"" lawfirm Wolfram and Hart in order to do right by the world and the powers that be.  It is here that Angel receives a mysterious package containing an amulet that when released sets free the presumably dead Spike!  The reason for Angel season 5's success rests largely on the history surrounding Angel and Spike, the only two vampires to have ever regained their soul, enabling them to have a conscious about their actions and the evil caused by vampire kind.  There are many stand-alone episodes that cover both Spike and Angel's old and new relationships, as well as episodes that contain a substantial amount of plot that is necessary for the ongoing connectedness of the entire season.  While season 5's episodes do not tie together in the same manner as season 4 (with a  breathless cliffhanger at the end of nearly every episode) the plot involving the apocalypse and a mysterious hooded sect (I won't give away more about them because I don't want to ruin the season for non-viewers) is by far one of the more amazing season plots within the Buffy-verse.Wes's ongoing descent into darkness, along with his intense longing to be saved by Fred's love is an extremely strong part of the show.  The transformation that takes place in the resurrection of Illyria is one of the coolest and most intrinsically fascinating things ever to occur on Angel.  The writers successfully killed off a character while allowing the actor and the essence of the character to remain on the show from week to week, an amazing feat that I do not believe should be overlooked.  Also, the return of Lindsay to the show added suspense and intrigue without even trying.  It broke my heart watching Lorne do what he knew he had to in the series finale.  Cordelia's goodbye episode is so well written and directed that it breaks my heart every time I rewatch it.  I was skeptical about Angel Season 5 without Cordy, but once again, the cast and writers pulled off Charisma's exit magnificently well.The final episode of the season was a very defining moment in TV history in my opinion.  The show went out with a bang that left longtime viewers and new viewers grasping unsuccessfully for more.  While season 6 lives on on the internet, it's a pity that the WB did not have enough respect for one of its two largest shows (the other being Smallville) to keep it on the air.  This show was tremendous, and season 5 was what I consider the best season of the series.  This DVD is highly recommended for all fans of television young and old, fan and not-fan, because Angel Season 5 was intensely good.",5,"Excellent Season, Forget the WB!",1099353600,"11 2, 2004",2004,3563,"['Angel', 'Season', '5', 'one', 'most', 'interesting', 'seasons', 'television', 'history', 'Not', 'merely', 'content', 'episodes', 'also', 'intense', 'marketing', 'done', 'Angel', 'fanbase', 'order', 'keep', 'WB', 'essence', 'canceling', 'one', 'highest', 'rated', 'shows', 'ratings', 'Angel', 'season', '4', 'were', 'lower', 'WB', 'anticipated', 'so', 'when', 'Buffy', 'ended', 'WB', 'was', 'quick', 'snatch', 'up', 'Buffy', 'largest', 'talent', 'Spike', 'what', 'became', 'Angel', '5th', 'last', 'season', 'second', 'half', 'season', 'WB', 'announced', 'Angel', 'contract', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'renewed', 'much', 'horror', '5+', 'million', 'Angel', 'viewers', 'week', 'what', 'did', 'do', 'fought', 'damn', 'network', 'bought', 'billboard', 'truck', 'save', 'show', 'had', 'thousands', 'signatures', 'failed', 'anyway', 'Nonetheless', 'remarkable', 'competence', 'Angel', 'cast', 'writers', 'shone', 'season', '5', 'even', 'more', 'had', 'epic', 'season', '4', 'Angel', 'fifth', 'season', 'up', 'gang', 'newly', 'taking', 'over', 'evil', 'lawfirm', 'Wolfram', 'Hart', 'order', 'do', 'right', 'world', 'powers', 'be', 'here', 'Angel', 'mysterious', 'package', 'containing', 'amulet', 'when', 'released', 'sets', 'free', 'presumably', 'dead', 'Spike', 'reason', 'Angel', 'season', '5', 'success', 'largely', 'history', 'surrounding', 'Angel', 'Spike', 'only', 'two', 'vampires', 'have', 'ever', 'regained', 'soul', 'enabling', 'have', 'conscious', 'actions', 'evil', 'caused', 'vampire', 'kind', 'are', 'many', 'stand-alone', 'episodes', 'cover', 'Spike', 'Angel', 'old', 'new', 'relationships', 'as', 'well', 'episodes', 'contain', 'substantial', 'amount', 'plot', 'necessary', 'ongoing', 'connectedness', 'entire', 'season', 'season', '5', 'episodes', 'do', 'not', 'tie', 'together', 'same', 'manner', 'season', '4', 'breathless', 'cliffhanger', 'end', 'nearly', 'episode', 'plot', 'involving', 'apocalypse', 'mysterious', 'hooded', 'sect', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'more', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'ruin', 'season', 'non-viewers', 'far', 'one', 'more', 'amazing', 'season', 'plots', 'Buffy-verse.Wes', 'ongoing', 'descent', 'darkness', 'intense', 'longing', 'be', 'saved', 'Fred', 'love', 'extremely', 'strong', 'part', 'show', 'transformation', 'place', 'resurrection', 'Illyria', 'one', 'coolest', 'most', 'intrinsically', 'fascinating', 'things', 'ever', 'occur', 'Angel', 'writers', 'successfully', 'killed', 'off', 'character', 'allowing', 'actor', 'essence', 'character', 'remain', 'show', 'week', 'week', 'amazing', 'feat', 'do', 'not', 'believe', 'should', 'be', 'overlooked', 'Also', 'return', 'Lindsay', 'show', 'added', 'suspense', 'intrigue', 'even', 'trying', 'broke', 'heart', 'watching', 'Lorne', 'do', 'what', 'knew', 'had', 'series', 'finale', 'Cordelia', 'goodbye', 'episode', 'so', 'well', 'written', 'directed', 'breaks', 'heart', 'time', 'rewatch', 'was', 'skeptical', 'Angel', 'Season', '5', 'Cordy', 'once', 'again', 'cast', 'writers', 'pulled', 'off', 'Charisma', 'exit', 'magnificently', 'final', 'episode', 'season', 'was', 'very', 'defining', 'moment', 'TV', 'history', 'opinion', 'show', 'went', 'out', 'bang', 'left', 'longtime', 'viewers', 'new', 'viewers', 'grasping', 'unsuccessfully', 'more', 'season', '6', 'lives', 'internet', 'pity', 'WB', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'enough', 'respect', 'one', 'two', 'largest', 'shows', 'other', 'being', 'Smallville', 'keep', 'air', 'show', 'was', 'tremendous', 'season', '5', 'was', 'what', 'consider', 'best', 'season', 'series', 'DVD', 'highly', 'recommended', 'fans', 'television', 'young', 'old', 'fan', 'not-fan', 'Angel', 'Season', '5', 'was', 'intensely', 'good']",N/A
867249,AJKWF4W7QD4NS,B0006GAO54,"N. Durham ""Big Evil""","[11, 24]","With Buffy the Vampire Slayer over, the fifth season of Angel was the first (and last) season to stand on it's own without it's sister program.  Season five opens promisingly, with the addition of Spike (James Marsters) to the cast as Angel (David Boreanaz) and crew take over the demonic law firm of Wolfram & Hart.  What makes season five of Angel so disappointing is how uneven it is.  It seemed that the season was going to rear towards some huge revelations and events involving the prophecy and just why Spike was brought back, but halfway through when the WB announced that they were canceling Angel, Joss Whedon and his creative team scrambled to wrap things up.  The return of Lindsey (Christian Kane) built up steam and then went nowhere, while the same can be said for the death of Fred (Amy Acker) and her return as the blue haired demon Illyria.  The final episode, in which the crew stage one last stand and we see heroes die, doesn't wrap things up as neatly as many would like, and left fans with their jaws open.  However, not all of season five was horrible.  The episode entitled ""Smiletime"", in which our brooding vamp with a soul is transformed into a puppet, is worth the price of admission alone and is laugh out loud hilarious.  Also, the brief return of Cordelia (Charisma Carpenter) is a standout that calls back to the previous seasons, and ends with an emotional punch.  The return of Connor (Vincent Kartheiser) isn't as satisfying, although he is more than welcomed in the final episode.  It's a sad end for yet another one of Joss Whedon's dynamic shows, and this is made all the sadder for the brilliance that got squandered thanks to the WB.",2,A sad ending for Angel,1100822400,"11 19, 2004",2004,1674,"['Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'fifth', 'season', 'Angel', 'was', 'first', 'last', 'season', 'stand', 'own', 'sister', 'program', 'Season', 'five', 'opens', 'promisingly', 'addition', 'Spike', 'James', 'Marsters', 'cast', 'Angel', 'David', 'Boreanaz', 'crew', 'take', 'demonic', 'law', 'firm', 'Wolfram', 'Hart', 'What', 'season', 'five', 'Angel', 'disappointing', 'how', 'uneven', 'seemed', 'season', 'was', 'going', 'rear', 'towards', 'huge', 'revelations', 'events', 'involving', 'prophecy', 'just', 'why', 'Spike', 'was', 'brought', 'back', 'halfway', 'when', 'WB', 'announced', 'were', 'canceling', 'Angel', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'creative', 'team', 'scrambled', 'wrap', 'things', 'up', 'return', 'Lindsey', 'Christian', 'Kane', 'built', 'up', 'steam', 'then', 'went', 'nowhere', 'same', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'death', 'Fred', 'Amy', 'Acker', 'return', 'blue', 'haired', 'demon', 'Illyria', 'final', 'episode', 'crew', 'stage', 'one', 'last', 'stand', 'see', 'heroes', 'die', ""n't"", 'wrap', 'things', 'up', 'as', 'neatly', 'many', 'would', 'like', 'left', 'fans', 'jaws', 'open', 'However', 'not', 'season', 'five', 'was', 'horrible', 'episode', 'entitled', 'Smiletime', 'brooding', 'vamp', 'soul', 'transformed', 'puppet', 'price', 'admission', 'alone', 'laugh', 'out', 'loud', 'hilarious', 'Also', 'brief', 'return', 'Cordelia', 'Charisma', 'Carpenter', 'standout', 'back', 'previous', 'seasons', 'emotional', 'punch', 'return', 'Connor', 'Vincent', 'Kartheiser', ""n't"", 'satisfying', 'more', 'welcomed', 'final', 'episode', 'sad', 'end', 'yet', 'one', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'dynamic', 'shows', 'made', 'sadder', 'brilliance', 'got', 'squandered', 'thanks', 'WB']",N/A

This season was better then the pervious seasons because the show was upgraded on it's Fifith and last season! Angel (David Boreanaz) and his team take over the Los Angeles/Law Offices of Wolfram & Hart, the evil law  firm.  Angel makes a deal with the Senior Parters to save his son Conner and to give Conner a better life with a real family. Angel fights the system from within inside the belly of the beast! Angel becomes the new CEO of an evil multi-million dollar corporation/law firm!  Spike(James Marsters) joins the cast of Angel! Angel and Spike have love/hate relationship that adds character development for the series. the Angel/Spike dynamic was what made the 5th season the best year! Also, The WB asked the producers of Angel to make more stand- alone episodes.  The epsodes stories began and ended on the same episodes. Angel's creativity began at a high point for this season! I really enjoyed these episodes! they are the best Angel could possibly deliver!  My favorite episodes this season are Conviction, Just Rewards,Unleashed,Lineage,Destiny, Harm's Way, Your Welcome,Why We Fight, Smile Time, Shells, Origin, Time Bomb, Power Play and Not Fade Away! My only problem with this season is that Sarah Michelle Gellar did not appear as Buffy Summers in the Angel episode, The Girl in Question. I wished she had done this episode because this Angel episode did not work without Buffy! I wished Sarah Michelle Gellar appeared on Angel's last season.  It would have made a big difference in the quality of the fifith season. Despite this problem, most of the episodes this season were very good. I highly recommended Angel season 5 DVD to anyone.

My favorite scene from the last episode was where Spike was seeking closure getting wasted in a bar on open mic night reciting his &#34;effulgent&#34; poem from a past Buffy episode.",5,This is NOT the 2006 slim box set,1392076800,"02 11, 2014",2014,1164,"['stated', 'not', '2006', 're-release', 'slim', 'box', 'set', '2008', 'slimmer', 'clear', 'dvd', 'case', 'set', 'picture', 'shown', 'original', '2004', 'box', 'set', 'out', 'way', 'can', 'tell', 'difference', 'original', 'release', 'box', 'Season', '1', 'etc', 'DVD', '2006', 're-release', 'only', 'Season', '1', 'etc', '2008', 'clear', 'dvd', 'case', 're-re-release', 'Complete', 'First', 'etc', 'Season', '6', 'DISC', 'SET', 'found', 'out', 'hard', 'way', 'many', 'returns', 'ebay', 'Amazon', 'who', 'use', 'stock', 'photos', 'only', 'place', 'found', 'selling', '2006', 'versions', 'was', 'Best', 'Buy', 'have', 'Angel', 'Buffy', 'charge', 'thirty', 'bucks', 'Buffy', '2006', 'slims', 'show', ""'m"", 'HUGE', 'Buffy', 'Angel', 'fanatic', 'show', 'was', 'cancelled', 'late', 'fifth', 'season', 'had', 'abrupt', 'ending', 'was', ""n't"", 'too', 'fond', 'first', 'watching', 'series', 'few', 'times', 'really', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'ended', 'other', 'way', 'epically', 'Genius', 'Joss', 'pulled', 'off', 'last', 'minute', 'favorite', 'scene', 'last', 'episode', 'was', 'where', 'Spike', 'was', 'seeking', 'closure', 'getting', 'wasted', 'bar', 'open', 'mic', 'night', 'reciting', '34', 'effulgent', '34', 'poem', 'past', 'Buffy', 'episode']",N/A
867252,A14AD0NQTRVVJC,B0006GAO54,Patrick J. Sullivan,"[11, 16]","This long review contains numerous spoilers.Angel's fifth and final year concludes with a whimper rather than a bang. It isn't an atrocious season, and it includes some very fine isolated moments, but all in all it isn't something the viewer would be able to productively re-watch, even years from now.As season five opens, Angel Investigations has been given the keys to the Los Angeles branch of its nemesis organization, evil multidimensional law firm Wolfram & Hart. W&H; provides them with Eve (Sarah Thompson), a liaison to W&H;'s demonic ""senior partners"". Eve is not a very successful character and is replaced midseason by Firefly alum Adam Baldwin as Marcus Hamilton. Baldwin is a great talent and does a good job in the role, though Hamilton is not nearly as interesting a character as Jayne, the mercenary portrayed by Baldwin on Firefly. One good ""addition by subtraction"" move in season five is the departure of the insufferably bratty Connor. He was never interesting or likeable.Charisma Carpenter as Cordelia is no longer part of the regular cast (she does return for one episode). Spike moves from Buffy to Angel following the final Buffy apocalypse. Harmony is added as a semi-regular, in a not very credible role as Angel's assistant. Season five suffers from a dearth of female characters following the exit of Cordelia. The many male characters naturally cluster around Fred, the only remaining female lead. Even Spike seems to develop a bit of a thing for her.Spike is probably the most successful character in the entire Angel / Buffyverse. Unfortunately, his move to Angel doesn't really work too well. It's impossible for James Marsters as Spike to be anything but entertaining, but he is given really poor material to work with on Angel. Spike spends the first third of the season spinning his wheels uselessly as a ghost. He doesn't really fit in in a law firm (nor do most of the other regulars, a major flaw in the move to W&H;). But worst of all, he's been mellowed, even somewhat neutered by achieving a soul and world-saving hero status. He is no longer the gloriously unpredictably violent Spike of his golden years on Buffy. Instead he's merely an annoying gadfly to Angel. Their juvenile sibling bickering detracts from both characters. And Spike is now even a bit of a kiss-up. He actually tries to give Angel's ""Scoobies"" (including himself) the plucky nickname of ""Angel's Avengers.""The one exception to the above is the strong eighth episode, Destiny, in which Spike and Angel have an epic struggle - which Spike actually wins, his first real victory over Angel. Unfortunately, this promising potential for conflict is never again exploited and Spike becomes more and more of a wisecracking sidekick as the season wears on. Spike needs to be Spike, not a Xander Harris clone!The title character himself was never less compelling than in this season. There is nothing comparable in season five to the previous dramas of his transformations into Angelus, his obsession with Darla, or his agony over losing his son. There is a brief attempt toward the end of season five at making viewers think that Angel may have ""sold out"" to W&H;, but it is never believable. It seems very obvious that he is merely playing a part.What made Angel (and Buffy) work were the ways in which the larger struggle made itself felt on the individual human / vampire level. For Angel himself, season five offers only a struggle so huge as to be emotionally insignificant. The titanic forces arrayed against him can squash him like a bug, but what they largely can't do is make him hurt the way he has been hurt before.The same flaw is present in the whole season, with the exception of the affecting midseason death of Fred and her replacement by Ilyria. Amy Acker does a great job in both roles. The whole Ilyria storyline never really gets off the ground and probably wouldn't have been introduced if the writers had known they'd only have half a dozen episodes left in the series when they brought her in, but even in her limited appearances we receive hints of how intriguing she and Wesley could have been together.But it is Alexis Denisof as Wesley who is the emotional core of season five. In the prior two seasons, the Wesley character had already eclipsed Angel and Gunn in interest. He is the true conflicted brooding hero of the final three seasons of Angel. Season five provides Wesley with some of his finest moments. He has probably the best death scene of anyone in the whole mythology, and his performance during Fred's death is equally strong. But he does not only shine in death. He has a number of great though understated moments: his reaction to the revelation that Gunn had had an indirect hand in Fred's death, his torture of a captured foe, and best of all to me, his casually deliberate shooting in the leg of a snotty W&H; employee who thinks the firm is spending too much time trying to save Fred.Although the true compulsion of this season's Wesley is not his ""badness"" but his sadness. It's impossible not to empathize with what his character is put through. His conflicted feelings regarding Ilyria are especially convincing. He hates her because she killed Fred, yet loves those traces of Fred which she retains. He is simultaneously drawn by and repelled by her physical form. As Angel remarks, it's all very weird - yet credible and sad.The one episode in which I largely wasn't very impressed by Wesley was one that seems to be popular with other viewers: the clich&eacute;d story in which he stands up to his father and proves himself to be a man. I had thought by then that Wesley was already far beyond the insecure young watcher of his Buffy appearances. The fact that the whole supposed father-son confrontation turns out to be a total gyp only makes it cheesier.Gunn has little to offer this season. His one good story is the deal he makes with the devil (W&H;) to stuff his head full of legal knowledge in exchange for...what? The price ends up being higher than anyone would have guessed. But his atonement for his mistake happens a little too quickly, though undoubtedly painfully. Lorne is even more lost in the law firm milieu. Having finally made Andy Hallett's character a credited regular, the writers had apparently run out of ways for his character to develop.The return of Christian Kane as Lindsey McDonald is supposed to be a dramatic high point. But it falls flat. Lindsey was never an effective nemesis of Angel's. He wasn't even at Lilah Morgan's level. He was just an undersized lightweight whom Angel easily dispatched in his first go-round. Pairing Lindsey with Eve doesn't create suspense but boredom.The move to the law firm doesn't really work for me. Presumably it's supposed to heighten the tension as we see our heroes making moral compromises with evil. But what happens for me at any rate is that familiarity with W&H; breeds contempt rather than fear. Once it's our main backdrop, W&H; seems a lot less menacing than it had before. With the once-mysterious white room, for instance, now just another set for Gunn to drop in on casually, the law firm is just another place not all that fundamentally different than the hotel.Additionally, I agree with the reviewer who pointed out that the special glass in the W&H; building which allows Angel and Spike to safely bask in the sunlight kind of undercuts the angst of their whole vampiric existence.For season five, the WB network requested fewer long story arcs and more stand-alone episodes. For some reason, Angel's producers took this as encouragement to just throw together random kitschy episodes about muppets, Mexican wrestling, werewolves, Nazi submarines, and anything else that struck their fancy. What does any of that have to do with a vampire with a soul trying to atone for a century of depravity? Not a whole heck of a lot. Stand-alone should simply have meant distinct from each other, not necessarily distinct from the actual set-up of the series.Dru and Darla appear in several flashbacks. None of the Buffy regulars appear, though they are all mentioned once or twice when minor Buffy character Andrew Wells (Tom Lenk) makes two guest appearances. Andrew is mildly entertaining, though he's more of a straight man here than he had been in Buffy season seven. He fills Buffy viewers in a bit about the post-Sunnydale doings of that show's characters (though not very sensibly; why would carpenter/contractor Xander be in Africa? Why is Willow ""based"" in South America, and why would Dawn be going to school in Rome? I think they just wanted to make sure we understood none of those characters were likely to show up in L.A.) One of the low points of Angel season five is the third-to-last episode, The Girl in Question, in which Angel and Spike jet to Rome in pursuit of Buffy. Without an appearance by Sarah Michelle Gellar, you just can't have a Buffy episode. Re-playing taped dialogue from Buffy's high school days and using an actress with blonde hair covering her entire face doesn't really cut it. And Angel and Spike were never more pathetic.The Nazi submarine episode IMO was lame and took severe liberties with what we're supposed to know about Angel's history. Also, the dynamic between Spike and Angel in 1943 was completely wrong. As we know from season two of Buffy, the ensouled Angel is just an object of contempt to other vampires, especially his former friends such as Spike who remember how bad the true Angelus was. The episode did offer for Buffy fans a look into the origins of the Demon Research Initiative which was featured in season four of that show.Many reviewers seem to have loved the episode where Angel was turned into a muppet. I hated it and thought that it was a shark-jumping moment if ever there was one. Sure, the series was a supernatural fantasy, but within that world, there were supposed to be rules, just different rules than the real world has. Classically, Angel had made a point of not insulting its viewers with cartoonish stuff like this. Let's face it: if a person can be turned into a muppet, then nothing is impossible, and there's no longer any reason to worry about any of the various apocalyptic events on the show. After all, maybe a pixy will come along and set everything right - why not?Besides that, the episode is just bad. Its supposed attraction is that it pokes fun at the pompously brooding Angel. But for me, the show had already long since mined that humor potential, many times over. Remember Angel warbling Barry Manilow songs in Lorne's caf&eacute; - repeatedly? There had already been dozens of moments like this one in the first four seasons of Angel. By season five he no longer has any remaining dark persona to be effectively ridiculed.There has been a lot of criticism or defense of the inconclusive ending of the series. Actually, I don't have a problem with that final scene. I think the problem was what preceded it, when IMO too many loose ends were too neatly tied up: Connor, Lindsey, Lorne, Cordelia, and of course Wesley. To me, it was all too pat. IMO they could have just left Connor out of things entirely, for instance, and left Cordelia in her coma. As the final scene acknowledges, sometimes things don't have endings, just stopping points.Angel spent four years trying to establish itself as an entity in its own right and not just a Buffy spin-off. It was largely successful. However, it was definitely set in the Buffyverse, and season five should have taken some account of the monumental events that occurred in that series' finale. Yes, a small army of Slayers showed up with Andrew for the task of reclaiming a rogue Slayer, but we never hear anything about how the sudden empowerments of hundreds, even thousands of Slayers all over the world is affecting the larger battle. The impression we had been given was that Buffy's power had been magnified 1000-fold. But to judge by effects, it must instead just have been diluted. Neither W&H;'s senior partners, nor the ""Circle of the Black Thorn"" seem to have been discommoded in the slightest by the sudden appearance of a multitude of new Slayers. So much for Willow's great accomplishment.At its best, Angel offered some of the best characterization of any show on television. Season five finds it not at its best, and with only Wesley, Fred, and Ilyria providing true human interest, it suffers by comparison to season two, for instance. I also agree that David Boreanaz had not aged well and was carrying more than a few extra pounds. This would be irrelevant on any other show, as most characters do age just as actors do, but vampires are of course the exception. I appreciate season five mainly for Acker's and Denisof's great performances. IMO, the writing was never weaker than in this final year.",3,An uneven season with an unsatisfying ending,1153094400,"07 17, 2006",2006,12800,"['long', 'review', 'numerous', 'spoilers.Angel',

One of the main things I've liked about Angel (and Joss Whedon shows in general) was the continuity.  The days of Star Trek ought to be left in the past, where individual episodes would stand alone at the expense of having no overall plot.  I *like* overall plot, and Angel had plenty of it in seasons 1-4.Season 5 seemed to give up the ghost, with a lot more stand-alone episodes that didn't progress the plot forward, and if that was done at the direction of WB, then I hope Joss can find a better network to work for in the future, one that will let him create the truely awesome work he's obviously capable of without tying him up with the incompetent whims of network execs.  Dear WB, you suck, thxbye. - Your CustomersThe season is definately worth buying, though.  Without spoiling anything, I think I can say that bringing Spike in as a main character was excellent.  I was disappointed with the way Wolfram & Hart was used, though -- again, very Star Trek.  Supposedly Angel and team are the head of a giant organization, but, like our old friend Captain Kirk, when any mission comes up it's the chief officers and maybe Ensign Noname going out on assignment.  Hmm, I wonder who's going to die?  Note to self, never work security on a starship or in a big evil corporation and resign immediately if ever asked to go on a mission with the bosses.  I thought that was a bit too predictable for a Joss Whedon show to stoop to.But still, I enjoyed the direction it took, nice wrap up for the show and, dare I hope, an ending that cries out for a follow up movie, ala the big screen?In the meantime, I suggest all the mourning fans check out Whedon's ""Firefly"" series.  If you liked Angel and/or Buffy, you might as well just buy Firefly on DVD outright, as you're guarenteed to love it.Here's to hoping Joss gets the freedom, desire and ability to do another full blown TV series.  He's the best we've got in the midst of a lot of tripe writers!

867260,A4FX5YCJA630V,B0006GAO54,"R. M. Fisher ""Ravenya""","[13, 13]","The fifth and final season of the outstanding spin-off of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" does not quite bring the show full-circle in the same way that its sister-show does, but it has the courage to stand on its own feet and go out with a bang in one of its strongest seasons. Far from the beginnings of the hopeful smile on the face of Buffy in her season finale, Angel and his (severely depleted gang) go out with a grim and determined air, and the differences in the final scenes cannot be a coincidence: ""Buffy"" ends on an open highway in the sunshine, ""Angel"" ends in a rainy alleyway. It underscores one of the crucial differences between the two shows; that for all its tragedy and pathos, ""Buffy"" was ultimately an upbeat show about the strength of friendship and the victory of goodness. ""Angel"" was more about the struggle against the encroaching powers of evil, forever hovering at the edges of ordinary life. (And for the record, as much as I love the Buffy finale ""Chosen"", I found the way that Angel's gang dealt with their final days [each going out to spend the day doing what they love most] far more touching than how the Scooby Gang dealt with *their* last apocalypse [which was finding a convenient partner and having sex]).This theme was made particularly clear in the finale of Season Four, in which Angel makes a devil's bargain with the rebuilt law-firm of Wolfram and Hart: in return for a new life for his psychologically-damaged son Conner, he would take the dubious position of senior executive of Wolfram and Hart. Having no idea of his reasoning behind taking the deal (having their own memories wiped as well) his team: intellectual Wesley Wyndam-Pryce, street-fighter Charles Gunn, physicist Winifred ""Fred"" Burkle and aura-reading demon Lorne, hesitantly join him in the institute that has been his main antagonist for the previous four seasons.That there is a deeper plan going on is certainly apparent - why else would the most evil company on earth sign on their sworn enemies as employees? With the absence of his best friend and seeress Cordelia Chase (in a coma since the previous season) Angel flounders in murky waters, unsure of where his allegiances lie. Clear messages from Buffy and the Scooby Gang indicating that they no longer trust him hardly help - and there's another unexpected spanner in the works. Spike (last seen being incinerated at the bottom of the Hellmouth) is unexpectedly resurrected as a ghost that cannot leave the Wolfram and Hart building. How? Why? There is clearly someone pulling the strings behind all of this, someone who's eventual appearance will send long-term fans into a frenzy of delight.The creators of the show knew that Season Five was the end for ""Angel"", and so do everything in their power to make this a memorable final season. There are plenty of moments that can be described as nothing short of epic; returns from past characters, deaths of major characters, new heights of impressiveness in special effects and fight scenes, dark internal paths that are walked by our regulars, and the sense of something building - something that everyone's combined forces cannot hope to overcome.There are so many *good* things that happen this season: all the treachery and plots that go on at Wolfram and Hart, the return of several familiar faces, such as Lindsay MacDonald (not seen since Season Two), Andrew from the Scooby Gang, Harmony Kendell as Angel's secretary (who had a great run in the franchise considering her character was introduced way back in Season One of ""Buffy!"") and even Anne, whose popped up both here and in ""Buffy."" Conner returns and is miraculously not-annoying, Cordelia returns to say her goodbyes, and there are plenty of new and fun characters such as the enigmatic Eve, brutal-but-charming Marcus Hamilton, and love-interest Nina Ash.That's not to mention flashbacks that explore the tense relationship between Angel and Spike (including revisits from Darla and Drusilla), further exploration into the Sanshui Prophesy, the emergence of an ancient demon, the betrayal of a semi-trusted collegue...oh, and Angel gets turned into a puppet. Watching Angel-Puppet morph into vampire, take on Spike, dive behind desks, get mauled by a werewolf (""Is there a Geppetto in the house?!"") and fight foul-mouthed, alcoholic muppets is surely the most hilarious hour of television ever. So much gets cramped into twenty-two episodes, and yet it never feels rushed or jumbled. Just writing all this great stuff down makes me want to go and watch it all again.However, one thing does annoy me: I have been frustrated throughout the forth and fifth seasons of the show as to Angel's romantic attachments and loyalties. In this season alone he is linked with three love interests: Buffy, Cordelia and a werewolf named Nina. Expressing deep affection toward all three females, it would have been an interesting situation to see how he'd deal if all three ended up in the same room with him! It's hard to feel that he's being sincere to any of them when he's speaking of love to whoever's with him at that particular moment. I always felt it was a bad idea to link Angel and Cordelia romantically together, and although we get a kiss that brings Doyle's visions full-circle (nice continuity there, as well as tribute to the three original members of the team) it is difficult to understand Angel's heart when a few episodes after Cordelia's return he's chasing after Buffy in Rome and sleeping with Nina in his penthouse. Of course, we all *know* that Buffy/Angel has always been the central romance to the franchise, but it's frustrating to see him (or rather, the writers) play with his heart at random.Although the ending tears one's heart out, and we're struck by the unfairness that there wasn't a sixth season that could have wrapped the show up to completion, it is a fitting end to the vampire-with-a-soul; an individual who was desperate to make amends for his past sins, and eventually comes to the realization throughout eight seasons of television (if you count his time on ""Buffy"", which I do) that he never could. But does this make him stop fighting the good fight regardless? No, the final words we hear him speak are: ""let's get to work"". Like Buffy, his journey is only just beginning.

867263,A16QODENBJVUI1,B0006GAO54,Robert Moore,"[10, 11]","These releases of ANGEL in new thinpak editions is very welcome.  I own a large number of television shows on DVD, but the original packaging for ANGEL was definitely among the worse.  Almost all of the discs in all five sets have a tendency to pop of the packaging, resulting in loose discs and in a couple of cases some scratching.  These new thinpak versions should take care of all the problems.  But not only are these being released in superior packaging; they are bargained priced as well.All good things must come to an end, and unfortunately with Season Five of ANGEL we saw not only the end of one of the great series that TV has produced, but the end of Joss Whedon's Slayerverse. With Whedon's recent announcement that he was closing Mutant Enemy's offices and that he does not intend to do another television show in the foreseeable future, this truly is the end of an era. At least we have 144 episodes of BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER and 110 episodes of ANGEL to remember these remarkable artistic creations by. And meanwhile we can all hope that Joss will reconsider and decide that he does have another set of stories to tell.After very nearly getting cancelled at the end of Season Four, the WB renewed ANGEL with the understanding that the show would try to move more towards a format where each episode stood alone (though they did manage to sneak in some great storylines along the way) as well as bringing James Marster's Spike over from BUFFY to try and bring some of that audience over. Artistically, Season Five is a huge rebound from the disappointing Season Four, with a large number of stunning individual episodes, a number of shocking plot developments, and some powerful storylines. I never did feel completely at ease with Angel and Co. taking over the running of the evil law firm of hell, Wolfram and Hart, but despite that they managed to do some amazing things. One reason I didn't like the Wolfram and Hart connection was the presence of the specially treated pane glass windows, which allowed vampires Angel, Spike, and Harmony to bask in sunlight without fear of combustion. But ANGEL was metaphorically always about being in the shadows, and I felt that visually the show didn't work as well in the light. But this was one of my only complaints with the season. The other was that some of the characters didn't receive quite the attention that they deserved. Even Angel moved somewhat out of the center at the beginning of the season, as Spike was brought in and established as a central character, though by mid-season he clearly was once again the star of the show. Wesley, who I always found to be the most interesting character on the show, was far less crucial to the plot for most of the season. Gunn for the most part was relegated to bit parts, while Lorne had almost no role to play at all. On the other hand, Fred became far more important, of which more in a second. Harmony, always a secondary character on BUFFY, became a permanent cast member and managed to inject some comic relief as Angel's secretary, though they didn't have time to blend her fully into the mix. After the initial jar of seeing Spike in L.A. rather than Sunnydale, he managed to become a great addition to the show, and one of the great regrets of the failure of ANGEL to get renewed for Season Six was the wonderful team that he and ANGEL made by season's end.The season saw a great number of remarkable individual episodes. One of my favorites was ""Lineage,"" where Wesley managed to confront his father (or what passes for his father) in what is one of the most stunning scenes in the five seasons of the show. ""Smile Time,"" written by TICK creator Ben Edlund, was arguably the funniest show in the history of the series, when Angel is transformed magically into a two-foot tall felt puppet. His assault of Spike when the latter makes fun of him and their ensuing fight is one of the great absurd moments I've ever seen on TV. I also enjoyed the episodes that dealt with the demise of Fred and the ascendance and development of Illyria.Just over halfway through the season, fans of the show were shocked beyond comprehension when one of the major and most popular characters, Fred, the geeky but beautiful scientist whom Angel had rescued from another dimension, died, her body being taken over by a powerful ancient demon Illyria. Although fans were initially angered by her demise, most quickly came to be fascinated by the demon who took over her body, and her bizarre relationship with Wesley, Fred's erstwhile lover, who hesitatingly helped her to live in a world she found completely alien. We know from Jeff Bell, ANGEL's executive producer, that in Season Six they planned to have the apparently dead Fred resurrected by Willow from BUFFY, who was to appear as a guest star. In Season Five we learn that there are remnants of Fred in Illyria, and Fred was apparently going to retrieve Fred, while leaving Illyria alive, allowing Amy Acker to play a double role. The possibilities in that would have been remarkable. For instance, Illyria retained many of Fred's memories, including the fact that she loved Wesley. Illyria had achieved a strange attraction of her own to Wesley, and one can only imagine how she would have responded to seeing Fred and Wesley together. Illyria's attachment to Wesley led to perhaps the most moving moment of the entire season, when Illyria, who could manage an absolutely perfect impersonation of Fred when she needed to, asked a dying Wesley if she wanted her to ""lie"" to him (i.e., pretend to be Fred). After he says, with a smile on his face, yes, she tries to comfort him by telling him that he is going to be with her very shortly. Immediately after he dies, the sorcerer who killed Wesley, regaining consciousness but not realizing that he was talking to a powerful demon and not a ""little girl,"" tells her to take her best shot at him. She does, and in the season's best visual image, the ""little girl"" spins, throwing a fist at the sorcerer's head, transforming from human to her demon form as she throws a punch at his head, completely shattering his skull (something a mere human was not capable of doing).The show ended with an utterly remarkably episode entitled ""Not Fade Away"" (which references great the Buddy Holly song later covered by both the Rolling Stones and the Grateful Dead). The controversial but to me very beautiful and appropriate ending expressed everything that the show was about. Ultimately, the series was about a man (or vampire) who had more to repent of than he would ever find forgiveness for. He had, therefore, more or less devoted his entire existence to the process of atonement, which the show finally interrupts as an ongoing struggle and not a mere event. As Angel, Illyria, Spike, and a severely injured Gunn rendezvous in an alley in the midst of a heavy downpour, they find themselves being approached by a huge group of demons, including a towering giant and a dragon. The odds look (and possibly are) impossible, but after saying that he wants to slay the dragon, Angel says to the remnants of his team, ""Let's get to work."" And with those words the episode and the series abruptly ends. I can't imagine a more perfect end. (April 2005 addition: In a new interview, Amy Acker says that Joss Whedon told her that Illyria at least would have survived the fight.)The WB announced the cancellation ANGEL immediately after their 100th episode. What followed was the most extraordinary campaign to save a show in television history. Fans undertook a large food drive in the show's name, organized blood drives, mailed tens of thousands of post cards, sent cakes to the corporate offices, and even hired a billboard trick to drive around Hollywood, all to no avail. There had been hopes for some made for TV movies and recently it was rumored that the new head of the WB wanted to revive ANGEL for Season Six. But star David Boreanaz and other performers had gone on to other projects, and then came the horrible announcement from Joss Whedon that he was not at present going to work on TV. We can hope that he might change his mind at some point in the future, but I, for one, am profoundly grateful for the two remarkable shows that he gave us. Unlike THE X-FILES, which while brilliant was never able to present a coherent or intelligible narrative about the world it was attempting to narrate, BUFFY and ANGEL gave us not only a tremendous set of characters and a great series of narratives, but a world mythology that was rounded, complete, and convincing. Joss Whedon and his associates raised the bar of what could be done in the medium of television, and as we see new shows like LOST attempting to work along the same paths, we will hopefully continue to benefit in the future from his great vision that started with a petite blonde vampire slayer and ended with a rumble in an alley.",5,ANGEL goes out in style with a marvelous final

I was sad, but also recognize I got an awesome last season.It's taken some heat from other people, but I honestly liked Smile Time just because the idea of the 'brooder' as a Muppet character was irresistibly hilarious. If the writers hadn't done overkill with story arcs in earlier seasons (and the series had more confirmed time) a couple of episodes of Angel as a puppet would have been hilarious. Plus, in classic Whedon format, they could have extended the critique of children's television as evil by having Angel beat an insipid dinosaur (you know who I am talking about). The only really bad thing about the episode is the tie-in doll is unbelievably expensive (at least as much as this DVD.I also liked the ending precisely because it reminded the viewers that everything in the world CANNOT be wrapped up in a cute little package. Life is tough because it has all of those loose ends which are never going to be together no matter how hard we try. Showing Angel's ultimate emotional-intellectual growth, it also is a good message for us at home.Maybe there will be Angel television movies, maybe not---but this season recovered itself just in time to close with maximum viewer kudos.

867265,A392BO4M88KUAD,B0006GAO54,Rock Montgomery,"[5, 19]","This is not the best season of Angel.  The introduction of Spike, an obvious ploy to attract Buffy fans, actually disrupted the chemistry that existed between the regular Angel cast.  Angel no longer seemed like the hero of the series, with his valiant ""vampire with a soul"" thunder being stolen by the whiny, juvenile presence of Spike (also a ""vampire with a soul"").In fact, the scattered characterizations almost ruined the flow that existed in previous seasons.  Gunn, in a ridiculous storyline, becomes a lawyer through some crazy experiment.  Fred, with the statuesque Cordelia gone, now becomes the hot scientist babe parading in silly short skirts.  Lorne, the new music director, became even more useless (the series could have survived without him).  Wesley seemed to be the only person that cared about anybody (his continued love for Fred made the complete absence of interaction between Fred and Gunn--who had been romantically involved--even more pronounced).  The new character Eve was a total bore, and her performance was just as gnawingly awful as Claire Kramer's in Buffy's fifth season.  Harmony, employed as Angel's secretary, was a huge misstep.  The wasteful Harmony episode clearly showed that she should be left as a one-dimensional character with as little screen time as possible.The episodes, clearly manipulated to accommodate Spike's presence, had a run-on quality to them.  The stand-alone facet obviously didn't work (as evidenced by the deterioration of character interaction), nor did the comedic efforts--which actually cheapened the suspense and drama that had transpired before.  With the exception of only a few episodes (like ""You're Welcome,"" ""Not Fade Away,"" etc.), I would say that this season ultmately became undone by too many unnecessary plots and characters.",3,"Final, but less than stellar, season of Angel",1110585600,"03 12, 2005",2005,1805,"['not', 'best', 'season', 'Angel', 'introduction', 'Spike', 'obvious', 'ploy', 'attract', 'Buffy', 'fans', 'actually', 'disrupted', 'chemistry', 'existed', 'regular', 'Angel', 'cast', 'Angel', 'no', 'longer', 'seemed', 'hero', 'series', 'valiant', 'vampire', 'soul', 'thunder', 'being', 'stolen', 'whiny', 'juvenile', 'presence', 'Spike', 'also', 'vampire', 'soul', '.In', 'fact', 'scattered', 'characterizations', 'almost', 'ruined', 'flow', 'existed', 'previous', 'seasons', 'Gunn', 'ridiculous', 'storyline', 'lawyer', 'crazy', 'experiment', 'Fred', 'statuesque', 'Cordelia', 'gone', 'now', 'hot', 'scientist', 'babe', 'parading', 'silly', 'short', 'skirts', 'Lorne', 'new', 'music', 'director', 'became', 'even', 'more', 'useless', 'series', 'could', 'have', 'survived', 'Wesley', 'seemed', 'be', 'only', 'person', 'cared', 'anybody', 'continued', 'love', 'Fred', 'made', 'complete', 'absence', 'interaction', 'Fred', 'Gunn', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'romantically', 'involved', 'even', 'more', 'pronounced', 'new', 'character', 'Eve', 'was', 'total', 'bore', 'performance', 'was', 'just', 'gnawingly', 'awful', 'Claire', 'Kramer', 'Buffy', 'fifth', 'season', 'Harmony', 'employed', 'Angel', 'secretary', 'was', 'huge', 'misstep', 'wasteful', 'Harmony', 'episode', 'clearly', 'showed', 'should', 'be', 'left', 'one-dimensional', 'character', 'as', 'little', 'screen', 'time', 'possible.The', 'episodes', 'clearly', 'manipulated', 'accommodate', 'Spike', 'presence', 'had', 'run-on', 'quality', 'stand-alone', 'facet', 'obviously', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'evidenced', 'deterioration', 'character', 'interaction', 'did', 'comedic', 'efforts', 'actually', 'cheapened', 'suspense', 'drama', 'had', 'transpired', 'before', 'exception', 'only', 'few', 'episodes', ""'re"", 'Welcome', 'Not', 'Fade', 'Away', 'etc', 'would', 'say', 'season', 'ultmately', 'became', 'undone', 'too', 'many', 'unnecessary', 'plots', 'characters']",N/A

SPOILERS!I live in Fairbanks, Alaska, where the WB wasn't available until very recently (even on our cable companies). I wasn't able to see ""Angel"" until the DVD sets came out. In some ways, I was lucky...I didn't have to wait a whole week for the next episode!Since Season 5 was long over before I had ever seen it, I had, of course, heard some spoilers. I knew that Spike was coming back (who didn't?), that Lindsey showed up again (and I was was pretty sure that he wasn't on the side of good), that Cordelia died, and that Fred died (but I didn't know about Illyria). So I relied on the DVD's, which I watched back-to-back in a weekend.Season 5 of ""Angel"" thrusts the gang into a much busier atmosphere than we're used to. There's always stuff going on at Wolfram and Hart. There's always people milling around and demons passing through. It's a far cry from the dinky office from Season 1.The episodes of this season are phenomenal in concept, writing and production. Here's what I thought were some of the highlights: ""Why We Fight"" is a story that has Angel on a submarine during WWII and he has to make a death-or-death decision to save the ship. ""Smile Time"" is the acclaimed puppet episode where demon puppets accidently transform Angel into a puppet. Hilarity ensues. ""The Girl In Question"" has Angel and Spike traipsing around Rome after Buffy, fearing that she's in danger from their old nemesis The Immortal, when in fact, she's dating him. Sarah Michelle Gellar DOES NOT appear in that episode.I was suprised about halfway through watching the season when I realized that I didn't miss Cordelia. The episode ""You're Welcome"" gives her a nice, although somewhat sad, exit to the series and we don't have to just remember her as the cleaver-wielding, virgin slaughtering wench from Season 4. The new characters on the series were fun, like Knox (Fred's evil assistant) and Hamilton (the second liasion to the Senior Partners). Harmony was amusing as Angel's secretary and she really shined as the star of her own episode, ""Harm's Way."" The only new character that I thought didn't really gel with the ensemble was Eve (the first liason to the senior partners), and I think it was Sarah Thompson's acting. She seemed disconnected to me.Angel also gets a girlfriend in this season, and of course she's not your average gal...she's a werewolf. Nina is a nice enough girl, but she's only in three episodes and I thought they were being a tad wimpy with the Angel/Nina story arc. The writers didn't really go for it and make them an item, nor did they make it really an issue why they weren't an item. I guess they're just kind of sleeping together, but wait...Angel tells Spike in Rome that Nina is his girlfriend, so I don't really know. The Nina and Angel relationship (whatever it may be) is resolved, though.The introduction of Illyria was something quite fascinating and new. Illyria is a demon that took form in Fred's body, killing Fred. Her contempt for humans while she was simultaneously experiencing human emotions for the first time caused her such distress that was fabulous to watch. Her relationship with Wesley was complex and interesting.The finale episode ""Not Fade Away"" is pretty spectacular and a near perfect end to a glowing season.

867272,A2WS9FE0NRXAFB,B0006GAO54,Shi Feng,"[9, 11]","don't you just looooove this year's DVD cover??? it's like Angel's dawn, that Angel is rising from the darkness of the night but not really in the light of day yet. Also, Angel's wing symbol is most noticible and appearant this year, it's like season five- Angel has got his wings.personally, I'm glad season five is Angel's last season, not because I want the show to end, but because I'm glad that Angel ended with a BANG instead of ended because no one watches it anymore-like most other shows. this means we will always hold Angel memoriable, and each season of Angel will always be unique. Also, there was another thing- DB's aging, seriously, by season five, can you say he's 26??? NOOOOOO, Angel is suppose to be immortal, but sadly DB isn't, if Angel goes on, even the most stupid audience can see that Angel ISN'T immortal. All my friends who are Angel fan has this reaction when Angel has ended: "" NOOO Angel ended *cry*, BUT David Boreanaz is SOOOO OLD!!!"" It's also no secret that DB is not the best preserved actor, in fact, he has the most appearant aging-by-year than anybody else on the set. And I can understand, I mean, wouldn't you get tired if you played the same role for 8 years. Joss Whedon really should've thought of doing Angel along side Buffy starting from Buffy season one, I mean, Angel doesn't appear very often in Buffy anyways, what a waste of good youth. Don't worry, I still love you DB (his acting goes the opposite way from his looks *complement*)!!!as for season five, there are some fantastic episodes, but also some dissappointing episodes, but I decided to do a rating on each episode like other people:conviction- 5/5 action is getting better and better, and Angel moved from "" oh he doesn't kill human"" , "" he doesn't kill human by his own hands, he usually doesn't kill human, to he only kills human when he's REALLY pissed- which is actually, quite often. the part where Angel kills his cleaners was priceless.just rewards- 5/5 yay Spike joines Angel team, I love the part where Angel freezes the wizard's bank account-priceless, Angel movin' on up!!Unleashed- 4/5 Nina thought Angel was a Frankenstein, anybody else get that?? LOLHellbound- 5/5 this is THE DARKEST, SCARIEST episode of Angel, if it weren't an Angel show I think I would get nightmares, but hey, Angel always create a safe feeling so it didn't scare me.Life of the party- 2/5 I really didn't like this episode to much, it was too cheesy and too halloween-ish. but lorne is what makes it worth watching.THE CAUTIONARY TALE OF NUMERO CINCO- 2/5- don't like cheesy comic heros with cheesy moves and masks on- gettin' too old, thank god Angel isn't like that.lineage- 5/5 *Wesley shooting his father for Fred* although I was a little dissppointed that it wasn't his real father, I really hoped it was, because I don't really like his father that much, with all the berating wesley thing.Destiny- 5/5 Spike winning over Angel was the best part, the fighting was great. Althought I'm not sure how I feel about Angel being humiliated by Spike, don't get me wrong, I really like that idea, I guess I'm a big Angel-character fan. the only dissppointment was in the end, the senior partner fixed the blood-eye problem, too empty!Harm's way- 4/5 only problem is the beginning, it's too cute. but I love the part in the beginning where Angel chopped the guy's head off. it shows his dictatorship, don't you just LOVE it when Angel is in charge???? *when you are CEO in WRAH you not only can fire your employee, you get to kill them* AWESOME!!!Soul's purpose- 3/5 the most unique Angel episode, his fantasy were fantastically created, good job DB for directing! but some parts were a little bit too cheesy and Angel not kicking ass is a little boring and dissappointing.Damage- 4/5 another really dark Angel show, second only to Hellbound. it's kind of like the movie Gothica, kind of frightens me, but very well done. only part I didn't like was knowing Buffy turned on Angel, and Andrew (really hate him). My god Buffy, I know you have this great life now and you're like the leader of all the slayers but Angel literately sacrificed a great deal for you, show some respect, please.you're welcome- 5/5 bittersweet return of cordelia, great ending, although after watching I kept wondering is cordelia a ghost? or just dead? what was Cordelia??? And also a little dissappointed in the fight with Angel and Lindsey, common Angel, you can't let someone like that outbeat your fighting skills, you're suppose to be like one of the most powerful vampire alive! * yeah yeah I know, it's important that other characters play a part in the whole saving the world thing*why we fight 3/5- one of the worst flashbacks of Angel, he is not suppose to be that confident and outgoing during that time, he's suppose to be reserved and not caring about what's going on in the world, this episode totally clashed with Angel's history and his character transformation, we do like to see Angel's reserve-ness once in a while ya know.Smile Time-4/5 I've heard this was suppose to be Angel's most funny episode, but sorry, I really didn't laugh that much as  alittle creeped out. It was a great idea to turn Angel into a puppet, but it really to me wasn't as funny as past season's funny episodes- Spin the bottle, guise will be guises etc. I guess it's because Angel is usually funnier as situational and ironical funny than something appearant funny thing happened to him. could also be because of the mood with the whole season- scary and sad at the same time kind of ruined it. Good part- WESLEY AND FRED FINALLY!!! it's about time!A hole in the world 6/5- I can't even explain why I like this episode sooo much, probably it's because I love to see Angel and the rest of the gane care for someone sooo much. I've always loved the way Angel treated Fred- not exactly ""loving her"" but treats her like a sister or a precious friend, makes me feel all warm inside. also, since I pretty much know that wesley is suppose to be the most tragic character, so his departure with Fred just completely purged me out, the part where Fred spends her last with Wesley in her room makes me think of Asian shows like Endless Love but of course much better and less pathetic, it's truly beautiful, words like Fred's "" Why can't I stay"" and Wesley's "" I've loved you since I've known you- I think maybe even before"" just completely inscribed inside my head.Shells- 5/5 this and rest of the show just demonstrates how good an actor Amy Acker is, I mean, Illyria is just nothing like Fred, I can't believe it's the same actor who plays the role. from the look to the voice, Illyria is just sooo UN-Fred, good job Amy Acker!!! oh, and I love the tag in the end too, soooo bittersweet and memoriable.Underneath- 5/5 great imagination on the hell, yay finally Eve's been screwed, oh, and I really think Sarah Thompson is a little fake-ish at playing Eve, she's really not that believeable, evil-wise. the revelation of the senior partner plans was DEEP!!! and Gunn taking on the punishment really is for his involvement with killing Fred really makes me sad. Oh, did I mention I like the new Gunn?? I like the old one too though, but great story evolves around him.Origin- 5/5 yay!!!!!! Connor and Wesley both remembers!!! I really believe Connor kills sajahn because he finally knows what's wrong and what's right, that he finally cares for his father and revenges sajahn for what he did to Angel- *hopefully??* And I believe that Wesley got his memories back made him more trusting Angel than before, because he knows he betrayed Angel yet Angel forgives him ( even though it took a while, but hey, Angel is not a god) and took away his painful memories and pretend nothing of the sort happend, god Angel is a good good man! he is even more good than any angels I've know :)Time Bomb-4/5 not sure how I feel about Illyria killing the gang, but thank god she doesn't have her god powers anymore, but her super super strenghth was quite a shame to disown, I really want her to kick some serious ass.The girl in question -1/5 the worst Angel episode EVER, if it weren't an Angel episode I would've given it a 0. what are you trying to do, Angel producers??? make us hate Buffy and her gang??? first there's the not trusting Angel with the damaged slayer, then there's the Giles and Willow not caring about what's happening to Fred, then this!!! Hey, when Buffy's mother died Angel paid his respect, so Fred and Cordy died nobody cared??? what the heck!! We all wanted to see Buffy face to face with Angel again and explain her feelings of mistrust to Angel, and Angel explain his things back. I think this episode was supposed to bring Buffy back for one final round, but since SMG was filming "" the Grudge"" (how that turn out by the way??), they had to do this, god, just don't make the episode if you know it's gonna be horrible, PLEASE!Power Play -6/5 BRILLIANT BRILLIANT PLOT!!!!!!!!!!!!! Even I was fooled and I usually don't get fooled. God, Angel was sooo brilliant. the only down side was Angel killing Drogyn, but hey, this only makes the show more real and advanced. and if you look closely, you can see Angel's deep emotion when he look into Drogyn's eyes before he kills him, he was quite regrettable and upset. PRICELESS!!!Not Fade Away -7/5!!! Yeah okay I know I'm exaggerating, but I really really love this episode, not because it's the last because really! I love everything about it. I love Lorne's choice of song, it just sung my heart out. I love Spike's poem- my hearts were out!!! I love Angel's meeting with Connor and that he knows something is wrong from Angel's visit, Connor is finally using his Angel-brain!!! Although I kept seeing Angel breaking down and losing it since it might be his last seeing his son but hey, you know our Angel, he never looses his cool. The part where Angel tells Connor to go back to his life after the fight with Hamilton, I really wanted Angel and Connor to hug!!! it'll be much better if they hug and telling each other how much they love each other. *yeah yeah I know it's suppose to be this ambiguous way*overall, yeah I was blown away, I think the ambiguous ending actually didn't make me feel as empty as the series finale of Buffy did. I guess it's because we'll keep especting more Angel episodes or we'll keep imagining with our own imaginations for what will happen next. this will make us remember Angel, and fill up the emptiness. oh, one more thing, Sarah Mccaulan (sp)'s Angel should be featured in one of the Angel episodes, seriously, it should be Angel's theme song or something, I love that song!!!!",5,blew me

Witty,"[0, 0]","From the pilot episode of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" all the way through this last season of ""Angel"", I always had one or the other, or both, to enjoy and keep my work week rolling along. Getting to watch Season 5 again after all these years was a real treat and I highly recommend ""Angel"" to anyone who is/was a ""Buffy"" fan and didn't give ""Angel"" a chance. I feel that ""Angel"" was consistently good from episode-to-episode and season-to-season. Something I always appreciated was how the writers (and Joss Whedon) never shied away from making fun of the show and/or the characters at times, even if the plot was dark. And when things got dark, they were really dark. But there's always a subtle sense of hope that runs through the episodes and seasons that, in conjunction with the great story-lines and writing, helped to bind the show together and keep things flowing along.I hated to see the show end, but it's always better to go out with a roar instead of a whimper.

Spike brings some consolation with his presence and needed truthful comments, but the season doesn't have the high quality emotion and depth of the previous seasons.

The return of Lindsey was interesting, but in the end he gets cheated.  Julie Benz and Vincent Kartheiser return for the only few episodes worth watching; Darla and Connor make everything good.

867275,AKIV6FWJPWZ0Y,B0006GAO54,"Tara Plumeri ""Snow Bunny""","[0, 2]","""I bid a sad farewell to the premature final season of Angel.  This was one of my favorite Seasons of Angel. It was shot down at it's peak with James Marsters reprising his role as Spike.So, there was pretty much nothing that was going to keep me away from Angel. And while I was optimistic and excited to see how two vampires with souls would co-exist in an evil law firm, I didn't expect to be so completely sucked in. No pun intended. Unfortunately, just as I was finding meaning in life again, the network geniuses at the WB decided that maybe the helpless didn't need a champion anymore and cancelled the BEST show on TV!!Season Five opens with a trademark Whedon moment. Dressed in a sexy black designer suit, Angel gallantly saves a damsel in distress from a hungry vampire in a dark ally (""Conviction""). Rewind to Season One of Angel and you'll recall that this is pretty much where our story began (which makes me think that I should have known this season was going to be pivotal).These initial episodes are definitely solid. ""Just Rewards"" officially welcomes Spike back into the world after his spectacular death at the end of Buffy. It seems that Spike is a ghost and is physically unable to leave the confines of the city without magically popping back in. So, as much as Angel would like to be rid of him, it looks as if some greater power thinks that these two crazy kids belong together. ""Hellbound"" wastes no time in raising the larger issues of salvation and atonement.Wesley gets to battle some old demons in the form of his disapproving father (""Lineage""), and Harmony finally gets her own episode (""Harm's Way""). I was so happy to see that Lindsey was back. But it seems that he's still holding a grudge against his former employer and is hoping to convince the Senior Partners that they've ""backed the wrong horse"" by giving control of Wolfram & Hart to Angel.""Soul Purpose,"" impressively directed by Boreanaz, depicts a series of Angel's mystically-induced hallucinations about his worst fears-his emptiness and irrelevance in a world where he doesn't seem to make a difference.But the crisis seems to have reached epic proportions in one of the best episodes of the season, ""You're Welcome."" Cordelia emerges from her coma, and it's as if she wakes up as the girl we used to know before the bad highlights and disturbing demon-possession. More importantly, she finds a way to finally remind Angel who he is. It's simple really: ""I'm Angel. I beat the bad guys."" What I love about this episode is the light bulb that went off over my head after I watched it; if heroes can't do it alone, maybe the rest of us schmucks shouldn't feel so bad. We all need a little help sometimes. Finishing up this spectacular series of episodes as we head toward the final stretch is ""Damage,"" ""Why We Fight"" and ""Smile Time."" The payoff for the Buffy fan doesn't get much better than ""Damage."" Andrew (Tom Lenk) is back to capture a mentally deranged Slayer on the loose, and not even Angel can stand in his way: ""I've got twelve vampire slayers behind me and not one of them dated you."" The interesting plot of ""Why We Fight"" is not just a great story-it proves that I was right about the Initiative's relationship to the Nazis (see Buffy Season Four). And ""Smile Time"" is undoubtedly a highlight of the series as a whole. Spike pretty much sums it up when he discovers a transformed Angel: ""you're a wee little puppet man!""And then, suddenly, things aren't quite so funny anymore. Just as Wesley and Winifred finally profess their feelings for each other, Fred becomes infected by the mist from an ancient relic (""A Hole in the World""). And while everyone works their darndest to solve her mystical flu, it soon becomes clear: Fred is dying :( *~~* This was the sadest storyline in all 5 years of Angel! But truely what I call MUST SEE TV !And so, I can't avoid it any longer. We come to the series finale. I would argue that the finale comes in two parts. For a few, brief, frightening moments in ""Power Play"" it appears that Angel might be buying into the system. There's almost a whiff of Angelus in the air as Angel begins to systematically disregard his friends, isolate himself as the leader and make more than one questionable decision: ""good, bad-none of it makes a difference."" After a few more disturbing discoveries, the troops begin to fear that Angel is positioning himself to join the most powerful of secret, evil societies on earth known as the Black Thorn-these are the folks who ""make sure man's inhumanity to man keeps rolling along."" Not a nice group of folks. And, here's the kicker. Angel is being initiated into the Black Thorn. But his plans may be slightly different than his new frat buddies had anticipated. See, he's gonna kill'em all. It's truly a great television moment when the whole gang agrees to the plan even though they know that it's pretty much a death sentence. So, they each make their pledge and get their assignments. But first, they get to go out and live the day like it's their last. Lorne sings a last song; Angel visits Connor; Spike finally gets the courage to finish that poem he started back before he became a vampire. And then, they'll each take on an arm of the Black Thorn and meet back when they're done. Only, they won't all make it back. When the tattered few finish their task and find their way to the meeting place, they realize that the battle has really just begun. They just destroyed the Senior Partners' instrument on earth, and that does not come without a price. Angel and company may have struck a mighty blow at evil this day, but unfortunately, evil has more than a few soldiers left. So they wait armed and ready, cornered in an alley, wounded and outnumbered, the odds stacked squarely against them. See, that's just the thing. The fight never ends. You know who my money is on, every time.ExtrasAs always, the commentaries prove to be fun, insightful and worthwhile. I can't help the fact that I will continue to prefer those featuring the thoughts of series creator, Joss Whedon. Even after I've picked an episode apart in my mind, he always manages to toss in some precious tidbit that sends me back to the drawing board.""To Live and Die in L.A.: The Best of Angel"": Well, Joss Whedon is in this one too, so I have to recommend you watch it. Plus, the look back at the previous seasons is fun.""Angel 100"": This was just sad. Everyone is so happy, and they're cutting a big, bloody cake. It's a fun, love fest of celebration and thanks for 100 episodes of a monumental show. Little do they know that in a matter of days after this little shindig, the show is about to be canceled.""Hey Kids! It's Smile Time"" featurette: Not the full insight into production that I was hoping for, but interesting nonetheless.""Halos & Horns: Recurring Villainy"": Always a pleasure to hear from Darla (Julie Benz) and Drusilla (Juliet Landau). I keep wondering why I don't go to these Buffy/Angel conventions. Next year, I promise.""Angel: The Final Season"": Watch it and weep for what they don't cancel.""Angel Unbound: The Gag Reels"": I am not ashamed to admit that I laughed continuously and out loud.By

867276,A2JP0URFHXP6DO,B0006GAO54,Tim Janson,"[10, 12]","The Final season of Angel was one that was very bittersweet for fans of the show.  Their loyalty has saved the show once but it was not to be this time.  Neither did we get the much rumored guest appearance by Buffy although we at least did get james Marsters reprising his role as Spike for the final season.  Add to that the death of more major characters than in perhaps any other TV show and Angel certainly did not go out with the tidy happy ending that Buffy did.  Some may be upset of the deaths of so many characters and the fact that the show ended with so much left hanging but in a way made sense for this show that never really dealt with happy endings...there was always something lurking just below the surface, even in the best of times with Angel.  Such was his curse I suppose.Notable final season episodes include:""Conviction""  Angel and company settle into their new digs at Wolfram & Hart as Angel becomes the new head of the company.  At the end Angel opens and envelope containing a mystical amulet that begins to spin and glow and out pops a screaming Spike, snatched at the moment of his death from the final Episode of Buffy.""Just Rewards"" - Spike finds that hes now basically nothing more than a non corporeal ghost since his body was destroyed and Fred tries to figure out what happened to him.  Later on in Fred's office, Spike reveals that everytime he vanishes temporarily he is one step closer to falling into hell.  Meanwhile Angel is having trouble with a Necromancer named Hainsley. He is charging Demons for putting their essence into fresh corpses, which he is buying from Wolfram & Hart.""Hell Bound"" - Spike is being tormented by the spirit of a brutal, wiccan surgeon named Pavayne. Since his magic helps him stay out of hell, he wanders around Wolfram & Hart cleaning up the loose spirits. With growing concern for Spike, Fred tries frantically to find a way to make him corporeal and prevent him from being sent to hell.""Lineage"" - Wesley's father makes a surprise visit and tells him the Watchers Council may be reformed.  But all is not as it seems with his father as he knocks out WEsley and steals an artifact from the vault with the intention of using it to steal Angel's will power and use him as a slave.""Destiny"" - A mysterious package arrives at Wolfram & Hart that recorporealizes Spike and the group learns that the existence of two vampires with souls has created chaos in the world. After Eve tells them about a prophecy that states that the only way to restore order is to find the Cup of Perpetual Torment that bestows human life, Angel and Spike battle it out for the prize.""Damage"" - Andrew, a watcher-in-training, arrives from Sunnydale with surprising information about Buffy and to inform the group that an emotionally disturbed woman named Dana is actually a new Slayer.  We learn that Buffy is in Italy with Dawn.""A Hole in the World"" - When Fred opens up an ancient sarcophagus that was anonymously sent to her, she is infected by a mysterious parasitic demon called Illyria. Angel and Spike learn that Illyria is an ancient demon who existed before recorded time, and they must race to return her to an ancient demon burial ground before she kills Fred and thousands of other innocent victims.""The Girl In Question""  - Angel and Spike travel to Rome with plans to rescue Buffy from their old nemesis The Immortal. While in Italy, they also attempt to retrieve the head of a fallen demon leader to prevent a perilous power struggle between several warring demon clans.  Buffy, of course, is never seen.""Not Fade Away""  The Finale!  Lots of mayhem and Death!  A fitting send off if there ever was one.This is easily the best Angel DVD set yet.  Comes with commentary on nine episodes as well as a half dozen featurettes.  A true collector's set.  Angel was always a great contrast to Buffy.  While Buffy was bubbly and fun, Angel was always dark and nihilistic.  With reality shows ruling the airways shows like Angel are becoming harder and harder to find.

867278,AV5G37VFE5NVD,B0006GAO54,Tom Benton,"[7, 11]","*POSSIBLE SPOILERS*Rarely, if ever, have I been left so speechless by a season of television as I was by ANGEL's fifth and final season.  There was a lot of talk when ANGEL was cancelled, for a number of reasons.  For one thing, the show had never been better - nor had its ratings.  For another, the cancellation was abrupt, shocking the fans as well as the cast and crew.  (The writers, including creator Joss Whedon, have repeatedly said that they had planned on going for at least another two seasons.)  When the show's cancellation was announced, the fans began screaming, raising somewhere around $3,000,000 in an attempt to keep the show on the air.  Despite their efforts, ANGEL's fifth season was its last.Season five picks up a few months after the end of season four.  Angel (David Boreanaz) and his team have been given control of evil law firm Wolfram & Hart's Los Angeles division.  They all suspect that the Senior Partners of Wolfram & Hart have something up their sleeve, but they try to go about their daily business anyway.  The many (evil) clients of Wolfram & Hart aren't too pleased about the Angel team's handling of the firm.  Though Angel and friends try to steer Wolfram & Hart towards good, it's made clear in the season premiere - titled ""Conviction"", and written and directed by the great Joss Whedon - that that will be no easy task.  The task becomes even harder when Angel opens a mysterious package - and a ghostly Spike (James Marsters) pops out.To try and name all the plot points of this season would be a monumental task.  There is a mind-boggling amount of events which occur during this season.  The power that comes with running Wolfram & Hart gradually corrupts Angel.  Wesley (Alexis Denisof) slowly grows closer to Fred (Amy Acker), until a major plot development which seems to literally yank your heart right out of your chest.  Gunn (J. August Richards) is given a brilliant legal mind and becomes Wolfram & Hart's top lawyer.  That is the most basic season outline I could possibly give you; as I've said, this season is incredibly (and wonderfully) deep.ANGEL was created by Joss Whedon and David Greenwalt.  Greenwalt left the show after the third season, leaving Joss Whedon in complete control.  During the fourth season, Whedon was trying to juggle three things at once: ANGEL, the seventh (and final) season of BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER, and Whedon's new sci-fi western FIREFLY.  With BUFFY's end and FIREFLY's cancellation, Whedon was able to concentrate solely on ANGEL for the show's fifth season.  Perhaps it's because of this that ANGEL's fifth season feels as though it belongs to an entirely different show.  It feels more like the beginning than the end.  For the first nine episodes or so, the show feels as though its being held up by some shaky footing.  I occasionally found myself wondering, ""What is this show?  Where's the old ANGEL?"" while watching those episodes.  But about midway through the season, the show suddenly finds its footing.  The result is the absolute greatest season in the show's history.Bringing the character of Spike to the show was a very clever move.  As any BUFFY and/or ANGEL fan knows, Spike and Angel despise each other.  This leads to constant feuding between the two ""champions"" throughout much of the season, which is, of course, quite funny.  As James Marsters was made a regular, we are given many more flashbacks involving the characters of Spike and Angel together.  Boreanaz and Marsters are especially great in episode 20, ""The Girl in Question"", in which Angel and Spike travel to Italy to ""save"" Buffy from her new boyfriend.  Naturally the two bicker constantly.  Also, because Joss Whedon was working on this show full-time, there's a whole lot more references to BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER, which'll please fans of that show.Due to an injury, David Boreanaz gained a lot of weight during this season.  I was really convinced that Angel was once a stone-cold, murderous barbarian after looking at Boreanaz in this season.  Boreanaz delivers some of his best acting in this season, particularly in the 100th episode, ""You're Welcome"" (guest starring Charisma Carpenter) - which is possibly the show's greatest episode.  James Marsters is great as Spike, though the character isn't really as interesting as he was on BUFFY.  Alexis Denisof is spectacular as Wesley; because of his great acting, I found Wesley to be the most fascinating character of this season.  Amy Acker is equally excellent, proving her versatility through her roles as Fred and the vastly different Illyria.  There are guest appearances in this season by some familiar faces, notably Juliet Landau as Drusilla, Julie Benz as Darla, and Tom Lenk as Andrew (from BUFFY).There are a number of remarkable episodes in this season.  The first is ""Lineage"", which sports an average story made great by Drew Goddard's clever, witty writing.  In the very funny ""Destiny"", Spike and Angel duel over who is the TRUE champion (the prophecy just says ""the vampire with a soul"" and, well ... they both have souls!).  David Boreanaz makes his directorial debut in the wacky, hilarious ""Soul Purpose"".  There's the aforementioned 100th episode, ""You're Welcome"" (the ending of which'll bring tears to the eyes of longtime fans).  Then we have the famous ""Smile Time"".  God, I could rave about this episode for days.  It is pure brilliance.  In it, Angel is turned into a puppet.  Hilarity ensues.  ""Smile Time"" is, in my opinion, the show's best episode.  It has outstanding writing and is just outrageously funny.  After watching ""Smile Time"", one can't help but question the sanity of those who axed the show.  ""Smile Time"" is immediately followed by ""A Hole in the World"", the tearjerker written and directed by Joss Whedon; this one's sure to make you ball your eyes out.  Lastly, there's the epic series finale, ""Not Fade Away"".  A more fitting end for the show I can not imagine.It is no small task to try and sum up this season.  For the first ten episodes, I was speechless; this was not ANGEL!  This was some different show wearing ANGEL's coat!  As soon as I hit the season's mid-point, though, I realized that this was most definitely ANGEL.  To put things simply, ANGEL's fifth season is head and shoulders above the rest.  It's extremely shocking, immensely moving, and filled with delightfully intelligent writing.  The series certainly went out with a bang.  How anyone could be so foolish as to cancel this TV gem is beyond me.",5,"The show's finest season - shocking, moving, and intelligent",1146528000,"05 2, 2006",2006,6503,"['*POSSIBLE',

867280,A2U80IPZXN5V1U,B0006GAO54,Tommy Sixx Morais,"[0, 0]","Angel's fifth and unfortunatly last season was aired in 2003-2004 and was announced to be cancelled before the season's end.It was a questionnable decision as the show was one of WB's highest rated that season yet they decided to cancel it for a series that no one cares for anymore,funny isn't it?That decision haunts them even today.Season five of Angel was arguably the best depending of your opinion but it still manage to be very interresting and captivating.Partly due to the arrival of Spike from Buffy The Vampire Slayer wich made this season the funniest of Angel and comedy had a great place in the first half of the season.Its also in this last season that Angel celebrates its 100th episode in wich Cordelia appears for the last time in the series.There is also the brilliant puppet episode ""Smile Time"" included on this.This season also had many Buffy fans watching the show since the show ended after season 7.The season starts with the Angel Investigations team moving in the Wolfram and Hart L.A. office after being given control of it by the senior partners of the company.That is one of the misteries that season five holds.Also Angel receves a package that contains Spike in it!Spike at first doesn't have ,instead is like a ghost as he doesn't feel anything by he is there.His body starts to fade away and he just really added humor to the show and he was a great additon and by doing that it attracted Buffy watchers as well to in conclusion become one of Angel's most entertaining seasons.There is also the mystery of Illyria who will ocupy the boody of Fred latter on this season.This season also has Angel litterally making a deal with the devil and there is an episode where he becomes evil.As one could have expected not everyone of the gang will survive and that makes some intense drama and especially since I and fans really liked that character.After Cordelia being in a coma in season 4(Charisma Charpenter who played her was pregnant)some fans tought the show wasn't going to survive without her.But with the great addition off Spike,it did and we can live with the fact Cordelia ain't around because he's a great character.Its also to note that Wesley Windam Prince(Alexis Denisof)was getting unleashed in recent seasons and we discovered that he is more than a nerdy looking guy.In fact during this season he goes from being prey to predator!The first half of the season was wonderfull and they were some of my favourite and some of the best moments of the series too.The second part of the season is more of story ark with Illyria and Fred with many other things that the team has to deal with,its a noticably slower moment in the season.It gets better in the last couple of episodes and the final episode despite some minor complaints made by fans was pretty good and we felt the pressure the crew had and it ended nicely with Angel saying ""Lets Get To Work"" to the gang(as there was an army of villains against them)and then saying ""Well personnally i kinda wanna slay the dragon"" ending on a humorous touch,and there is enough emotion and action to making anyone's heart beat real fast.I really enjoyed watching the team work and issues between Angel and Spike.Also i tought they did a great job of doing a season that wasn't confusing like season four was,it was like some maze and all.The WB themselves tought that as they said that they would renew Angel's contract for another year during season four at the condition that those complicated plots as season four wouldn't be too much of a big presence instead wanting the show to return to its original monster-of-the-week format as in the first season.They did that in season 5 and it worked and immediatly worked with viewers of the show and its ratings just exploded,Spike being a reason why.Some other characters got some more spotlight thi season like Fred who became very important by the end of the season and Harmony who took a big place and was hilarious as Angel's secretary.New character Nina,the werewolf was interresting but was only present in a couple of great episodes and i tought she there was a great story going with her.Its too bad that the show got cancelled then when it was doing so great and it became even more interresting with Spike in it and if there would have been a sixth season it would have been very good as well.Even Spike couldn't save the series from being cancelled.There was still potential and stories to be told about Angel,the vampire with a soul,for instance we would probably have seen Fred returning and Willow from Buffy would have made a special appearance by making her come back with her wizard skills along with another character.No one expected the show would be cancelled at that time and neither did i,still Joss Whedon gave us 144 episodes of Buffy and 110 of Angel.This closed the Buffyverse and Whedon stopped doing any other shows and closed his company Mutant Ennemy Inc.A great ending season of a great series and it provided great episodes such as ""Smile Time"" and ""Lineage"" were Wesley faces his father wich were

Mild mannered Fred turning into an ancient powerwas a brilliant move.  The women in this season were also the sexiest ever.  Of course, there are the fatal attraction plots with the liason to Wolfram and Hart.  Numero Cinqo about the 5 dead Mexican wrestlers is an amazing and compelling story.  The soul swapping between Spike and Angel, and the ""Necro"", (Manager of the Dead)was frightening and compelling. The final final with the rain falling in the urban landscape, thousands of dead soulsto fight, and the ""Let's Roll"" ending bring back the reality of the never ending fight between good and evil, even among the dead.

867282,A2KUMYWXAQNARZ,B0006GAO54,toronto,"[0, 0]","The three best episodes of this season are what make the set worth buying.The first, ""You're Welcome"" which brings Cordelia back is the episode where Charisma Carpenter finally turns into a fully rounded actress.  She always was a great comedienne, and comediennes are consistently underrated; but they do have the problem that their best comic responses turn into ""tics"".  I never for a moment believed in the possibility of a relationship between her and Angel in the series because of that, that sense that she only had a few moves in her kit -- only a narrow range. Lo and behold in this episode she suddenly blossoms out, obviously because of the tremendous emotional issues at stake.  Her scenes with Angel (especially the middle one where they talk about what might have been) are beautiful:  she finds her range, really for the first time in the whole enterprise -- the whole dark period for her was a dreadful mess.  In that little scene where she sits with Angel talking about what might have been she is extraordinary -- she really captures what you can do on television:  incredibly subtle acting.  Ironically enough you can also see in this episode why she has to die or go away:  she has become an adult.  The whole premise of Angel is that everyone is a comic character -- it would be impossible for the show to have a real adult on board, which is what Cordelia is at the end.  She essentially makes everyone else cardboard.  Which is interesting.  One suspects that the ""higher power level"" is to stop being an actor and become a person.The second and third best episodes are ""A Hole in the World"" and ""Not Fade Away"" (there are nice moments in ""the Girl in Question, a piece of otherwise crap) because of the Wesley/Fred/Illyria arc.  The rest of these episodes are the usual fine stuff, but it is the realization by the writers that they are really on to something new that sparks these scenes. The death scenes and the basic situation are quite astonishing in their vertigiousness.  The writers and the actors really did something here:  the shifts back and forth between beings are mesmerizing, and the death scenes very fine, not sentimental at all.  You can only do this kind of thing on Angel! (The only emotional equivalent are the birth/death pangs of Darla). It is a terrible pity they had to end it when they did:  one can only imagine from the brief taste how agonizing the Wesley Illyria future might have been.

Stewart ""moviemancritter""","[48, 53]","When the fifth season of Angel premired on the WB unbelivible things where happening and continued the happen all the way up until the final episode.  Although viewership had gone down in season 4, and the rating for Angel's fifth season where the highest the show ever saw (and it was up against the breakout show of the year ""the oc"").But in Febuary on 2004, despite all the high ratins, the WB announced teh cancellation of the show.  For Three months following thousands of fans protested the cancellation and tried all they could to get the show to continue.  Unfortunatly, there efforts didn't realize any results beyond the small promise of TV movies (which have been looking less and less likely).But getting back to the fifth season, the story continues about 22 days after the events in the season 4 finale (and about 19 days after the events in the buffy the vampire series finale) and finds the gang working at wolfram & heart trying to figure out how they can use their new toy to help the helpless, but then Angel gets an unexpected packing containing an old friend (or enemy depending on how to look at it).Despire loosing one of their strongest assets (Charisma Charpenter, who reprises her role of Cordelia Chase in episode 100 for Cordy's last Hurah) the fifth season is a pretty strong season, and one of the best in the buffyverse.  Coming off the heels of the cancellation of Buffy, their was alot of pressure on Angel to continue the Buffyverse, which it did perfectly.  The season was made up of many ""stand-alone"" episodes which suddely started an overlaping arc (which was to continue into season 6) and also dropping hints as the the whereabout of are favorite scoobies.The one complant many fans seem to have is how the last 3 episodes of the show seemed rushed, which they do.  Whedon and company basically had to put a season's worth of episodes in the space of 3 episodes to end the series, which under the circumstances they pulled of well.Wheither you enjoyed the final season of angel, or if you didn't this will probably be the last Buffyverse DVD we see in a LONG time.

I had to talk about..THE CAUTIONARY TALE OF NUMERO CINCO-Made me laugh because it was so weird.  A lot of people didn't like that ep. much.  You gotta be a fan of Mexican wrestling!Hellbound- good old fun.  We Angel as a show was som much better than Buffy.  The good guys don't always win like in Buffy.  Grey dissisions have to be made all the time.  They also made Spike more ""real"" and dark to me.  Good.Broken - Finally those bastards of the ""scoobie gang"" show there colors.  None of them liked Angel in the first place, save Buffy. This reminded me how much I hate most of the Buffy's characters.  Angel fights the REAL fight, THE real Apocalypse, and asks for nothing but a little help.  The set him up.  God, I hate the slayer and her little troupe..  Xander and Spike only made Buffy tolerable to me.Shell- wow.  I didn't see that comming by a mile.  Never thought they'd kill any of the main characters that early..  Amy Ackner kick's so much ass as an actress.  Her transformation from a dork into a God-king is amazing.The reason I always loved Angel was because of the darkness in it.  The world isn't perfect.  The descisions the team at Wolfram and Heart make is grey and changes the world.  Buffy was never about the good fight.  Sure she saves the world a few times, but never at any cost.  The good guys always win.  No one ever dies or gets hurt in the sidelines.  Just look at the joke the ""apocalypse"" was at season 7.  I'm all for female empowerment, but come on...a few dozen slayers fight thousands of prehistoric vamps..and win?  Buffy could barely beat one of them.  They beat the First?  It doesn't have a form, and there are other Hellmouths.  They accomplished nothing.  Not in Angel.  They fight the 1000 year war.
