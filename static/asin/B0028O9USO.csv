Geoffrey Rush is very charismatic and rather incomparable in his performance as the Tailor of Panama. This film was made as one of Brosnan's non-Bond films during his tenure as 007 and he expertly plays his British Intelligence part convincingly, very realistically and then some with no hint of the cinematic James Bond entrapping. The plot is intriguing as Brosnan plants innuendo and false information through the connected Geoffrey Rush to accomplish his mission. Boorman gives us great character studies which are the foundation of this little gem of a film. This is a long overdue film of substance from director John Boorman, the man who gave us EXCALIBUR (1981) and POINT BLANK (1967) and DELIVERANCE (1972). This is one of Pierce Brosnan's best films.",5,Intriguing Subtle Spy Film and Great Performances,1379376000,"09 17, 2013",2013,827,"['enjoyed', 'movie', 'immensely', 'found', 'be', 'very', 'interesting', 'Geoffrey', 'Rush', 'very', 'charismatic', 'rather', 'incomparable', 'performance', 'Tailor', 'Panama', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'one', 'Brosnan', 'non-Bond', 'films', 'tenure', '007', 'expertly', 'British', 'Intelligence', 'part', 'convincingly', 'very', 'realistically', 'then', 'hint', 'cinematic', 'James', 'Bond', 'entrapping', 'plot', 'intriguing', 'Brosnan', 'plants', 'innuendo', 'false', 'information', 'connected', 'Geoffrey', 'Rush', 'accomplish', 'mission', 'Boorman', 'great', 'character', 'studies', 'are', 'foundation', 'little', 'gem', 'film', 'long', 'overdue', 'film', 'substance', 'director', 'John', 'Boorman', 'man', 'who', 'gave', 'EXCALIBUR', '1981', 'POINT', 'BLANK', '1967', 'DELIVERANCE', '1972', 'one', 'Pierce', 'Brosnan', 'best', 'films']",N/A

The acting was O.K., but the story was not very good.  There were a lot of flashbacks that made the story hard to follow.  Than there was a lot of sex , which did not seem to have a place in this film except maybe to eat up 30 minutes of time.This movie seemed to be a very poor rehash of the very good spy movie of Alec Guinness in OUR MAN IN HAVANA.I don't think I would buy this movie again, but like I say it's not the most terrible movie ever made.l",3,so so movie,1394150400,"03 7, 2014",2014,558,"['blueray', 'sound', 'were', 'good', 'However', 'must', 'say', 'was', 'little', 'disappointed', 'movie', 'acting', 'was', 'O.K.', 'story', 'was', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'were', 'lot', 'flashbacks', 'made', 'story', 'hard', 'follow', 'Than', 'was', 'lot', 'sex', 'did', 'not', 'seem', 'have', 'place', 'film', 'maybe', 'eat', 'up', '30', 'minutes', 'time.This', 'movie', 'seemed', 'be', 'very', 'poor', 'rehash', 'very', 'good', 'spy', 'movie', 'Alec', 'Guinness', 'OUR', 'MAN', 'IN', 'HAVANA.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'would', 'buy', 'movie', 'again', 'say', 'not', 'most', 'terrible', 'movie', 'ever', 'made.l']",N/A
