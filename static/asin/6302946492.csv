Nyhuis,"[7, 53]","The movie starts out like some kind of &quot;Heavenly Creatures,&quot; with two girls taking interest in each other and living out their girly fantasies.  They then run around crazy-like, jumping over little boys and fire hydrants.  The director must've really liked this effect, because he shows it in slow-motion with this weird music in the background.  I didn't get that part at all.One of the reasons I was watching this was that I heard Peter Sellers was in it.  Well, he is, but not really.  It's more about these girls who are always talking about girly things.  The movie made me uncomftorable, knowing a guy director made this movie.  Was he like obsessed with filming girls talking about their life or something?You know, I can't say this review is fair because I turned the film off half-way through.  It's like, when you see something that's already going nowhere and you have no interest in it, you really don't want to waste your time on the rest of it.  I mean, I had already wasted one hour of my life; didn't want to waste that last one.  No oh oh ohhhhhh.  Didn't wanna waste that last one.  No oh oh ohhhh.

347191,A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z,6302946492,Annie Van Auken,"[1, 1]","A good third of THE WORLD OF HENRY ORIENT occurs at Christmas time. Because it's set in NYC, we see the tree in Rockefeller Center and other festive Manhattan decorations. There's a holiday party at the home of a well-to-do couple (they have a lush white tree with green ornaments) while at a single mom's flat the family's humble tree sits off in a corner of the living room.The film stars Peter Sellers, but his is a peripheral character. Also in the cast are Paula Prentiss (small role in first half-hour), Tom Bosley, Angela Lansbury and Phyllis Thaxter. The leads in this story are really two unknown 14-year-olds: Tippy Walker as 'Val' and Merrie Spaeth as 'Gil.'Val looks like the youngest Brady girl with her blonde pigtails while Gil is more sophisticated. She has a genius IQ and plays beautiful piano. Gil becomes infatuated with a mediocre concert pianist (Sellers) and the two girls follow him all over Manhattan. The story's more complex than that, for it's really about these kids' friendship and Gil's troubled family life.Henry Orient is an odd character-- he doesn't like to practice and it shows in his performances. After a Christmas night concert at Carnegie Hall, several members of the audience hang by the stage door so they can jeer and boo him, like they would a ballplayer who muffed a catch. Henry's a playboy and a paranoid coward-- and those are a couple of his better traits!This quirky George Roy Hill picture is a thoughtful family story that deals with holiday depression, divorce and especially the concerns of adolescent girls.Related item:The very next project Peter Sellers worked on was Blake Edwards'A SHOT IN THE DARK(1964), the first ""Pink Panther"" movie.Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 imdb viewer poll rating.(6.9) The World of Henry Orient (1964) - Peter Sellers/Paula Prentiss/Angela Lansbury/Tom Bosley/Phyllis Thaxter/Bibi Osterwald/Merrie Spaeth/Tippy Walker/John Fiedler/Al Lewis/Peter Duchin",4,Nearly-forgotten teen holiday movie,1252454400,"09 9, 2009",2009,1960,"['good', 'third', 'THE', 'WORLD', 'OF', 'HENRY', 'ORIENT', 'Christmas', 'time', 'set', 'NYC', 'see', 'tree', 'Rockefeller', 'Center', 'other', 'festive', 'Manhattan', 'decorations', 'holiday', 'party', 'home', 'well-to-do', 'couple', 'have', 'lush', 'white', 'tree', 'green', 'ornaments', 'single', 'mom', 'flat', 'family', 'humble', 'tree', 'sits', 'off', 'corner', 'living', 'room.The', 'film', 'stars', 'Peter', 'Sellers', 'peripheral', 'character', 'Also', 'cast', 'are', 'Paula', 'Prentiss', 'small', 'role', 'first', 'half-hour', 'Tom', 'Bosley', 'Angela', 'Lansbury', 'Phyllis', 'Thaxter', 'leads', 'story', 'are', 'really', 'two', 'unknown', '14-year-olds', 'Tippy', 'Walker', ""'Val"", 'Merrie', 'Spaeth', ""'Gil"", 'youngest', 'Brady', 'girl', 'blonde', 'pigtails', 'Gil', 'more', 'sophisticated', 'genius', 'IQ', 'beautiful', 'piano', 'Gil', 'infatuated', 'mediocre', 'concert', 'pianist', 'Sellers', 'two', 'girls', 'follow', 'Manhattan', 'story', 'more', 'complex', 'really', 'kids', 'friendship', 'Gil', 'troubled', 'family', 'life.Henry', 'Orient', 'odd', 'character', ""n't"", 'like', 'practice', 'performances', 'Christmas', 'night', 'concert', 'Carnegie', 'Hall', 'several', 'members', 'audience', 'hang', 'stage', 'door', 'can', 'jeer', 'boo', 'would', 'ballplayer', 'who', 'muffed', 'catch', 'Henry', 'playboy', 'paranoid', 'coward', 'are', 'couple', 'better', 'traits', 'quirky', 'George', 'Roy', 'Hill', 'picture', 'thoughtful', 'family', 'story', 'deals', 'holiday', 'depression', 'divorce', 'especially', 'concerns', 'adolescent', 'girls.Related', 'item', 'very', 'next', 'project', 'Peter', 'Sellers', 'worked', 'was', 'Blake', 'Edwards', 'A', 'SHOT', 'IN', 'THE', 'DARK', '1964', 'first', 'Pink', 'Panther', 'movie.Parenthetical', 'number', 'preceding', 'title', '1', '10', 'imdb', 'viewer', 'poll', 'rating', '6.9', 'World', 'Henry', 'Orient', '1964', 'Peter', 'Sellers/Paula', 'Prentiss/Angela', 'Lansbury/Tom', 'Bosley/Phyllis', 'Thaxter/Bibi', 'Osterwald/Merrie', 'Spaeth/Tippy', 'Walker/John', 'Fiedler/Al', 'Lewis/Peter', 'Duchin']",N/A

Valerie Boyd and  Marian Gilbert(played by Tippy Walker and Merrie Spaeth, respectively) are  two unlikely friends who share a zest for life. When the two girls come  across the eccentric pianist Henry Orient, played by Peter Sellers,  infatuation ensues. Thus begins the pursuit for the infamous Henry Orient.  Henry Orient is a madly altruistic ladies man who has been trying to seduce  a married woman, Stella (played by Paula Prentiss). Strange things are  happening which cause him to believe her husband has found them out and  that they are being spied upon. Little does he know that Val and Gil are  the ones doing the spying. The girls create a situation which causes some  confusion among the adults in the movie. When Val's parents, played by Tom  Bosley (Happy Days) and Angela Lansbury (Murder She Wrote), become  intimately involved with the girls hijinks and Henry Orient, the girls are  forced to grow up and face life as more than just fun and games. I watched  this movie and felt an intense feeling of nostalgia. I was reminded of the  days of being young and careless (Ahh. . . the simpler times.). I recalled  the feeling of living at home and chumming around with friends. Ahh the  good 'ole days... Okay, so I'm not that much older; I still goof off with my  buddies and yes, I have friends that still live at home. What I am trying  to say is that this movie left me with a longing of days that seemed more  innocent.

347193,A2FQ2M9ZIODFKV,6302946492,Bradley Friedman,"[13, 13]","I was delighted to come across so many other rave reviews for this gem that I wanted to add my voice to the others and urge those of you who have never discovered this film to buy or, at least, rent it. Alternately funny and moving, I can only sum up my reaction to say that the film warms my heart, and I watch it frequently if I'm feeling blue. Filled with great star turns as well as a host of wonderful cameos (Paula Prentiss, Bibi Osterwald and Al Lewis especially), the story is filled with countless moments that grab me emotionally, particularly near the end when, one by one, the members of Tom Bosley's family discover the truths about themselves and each other and face the emotional repercussions of these truths.The two young stars are not particularly great actresses. Better than that, they seem like real young girls on the verge of womanhood. The film evokes its time and place with fondness and affection. I grew up across the country from NYC in San Francisco, and yet I've watched the film so many times that I wax nostalgic for a city in which I've never lived! Go figure.Finally, I can't say enough about Angela Lansbury. I know how frustrated she was with the studios' constant casting her as villainous mothers, and I hope she achieves her wish of finding a truly satisfying film role before she retires. Still, I hope she knows that her work as one of the few actors to successfully span the worlds of theatre, film and television speaks for itself, and her range and depth of talent is apparent in this, and all her roles. In this film (as in THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE, one of the best thrillers ever and her greatest film role), she is fearless in her willingness to create a monster who is at once compelling and abhorrent. We understand why she fascinates her husband and daughter at the same time that she repels them. Her villainy is delicious here, and her comeuppance is one of the most satisfying moments in an altogether satisfying film.

Although Peter Sellers is top-billed in the cast (and plays the title role) by no means however is the star of the show.THE WORLD OF HENRY ORIENT is the story of two misfit teen girls: Marian (Merrie Spaeth) and Valarie (Elizabeth ""Tippy"" Walker).  Marian lives with her divorced mother and a close family friend in a cosy apartment; Valarie's globe-trotting parents rarely bother her, and she lives with a housekeeper.  Their friendship is sealed when Valarie develops a crush on a handsome, avant-garde pianist named Henry Orient (Peter Sellers) and the two girls resolve to follow--ie: stalk--him all over New York.  This hero worship, which mainly involves the girls standing outside his apartment block wearing Chinese coolie hats, soon scares off Henry's latest 'married' girlfriend (Paula Prentiss) and wreaks havoc on his performance schedule!A charming, bittersweet comedy, THE WORLD OF HENRY ORIENT is no ""Pink Panther""--nor does it pretend to be--but offers it's own special brand of low-key magic.  Angela Lansbury plays Valarie's icy, calculating mother, who contrasts dramatically with the down-to-earth members of Marian's loving household (Phyllis Thaxter and Bibi Osterwald).  Elmer Bernstein contributes a whimsical musical score and George Roy Hill's sensitive direction delivers some lovely performances from Spaeth and Walker.

I don't really know. It has a unique blend of comedy, drama, and style.The plot: In 1960s New York, two nymphets Val and Gil chase around world famous pianist Henry Orient (Sellers) causing all sorts of fun and trouble. There's really not much beyond that.I was disappointed to find that one of my favorite films `Dick' was plagiarized from `Henry Orient.' You may remember `Dick' a few years ago about two nymphets, Kirsten Dunst and Michelle Williams, chasing around Dick Nixon, causing him so much trouble he is forced to resign. A great movie. But I find it grossly disgusting when a remake does not credit the original. As recently seen in `Three Kings' `The Manchurian Candidate' `Pearl Harbor.'`Dick' is a better film and as you might guess from the title the sexual humor is far more.I would also like to join the choir of WHERE IS THE SOUND?

It is incredibly funny, charming, and a perfect film about youth and life in New York in the early 1960's.Sellers plays Henry Orient, an avant-garde pianist and master Lothario, who becomes the idol of two adolescent girls, Val Boyd, played by Tippy Walker, and Marian 'Gil' Gilbert, played by Merrie Spaeth. These girls are perfectly cast in their roles, and have wonderful chemistry. Val is the daughter of wealthy Park Avenue parents, portrayed by Tom Bosley and Angela Lansbury. Gil is from a broken home, and lives with her mother. The girls meet at school, then attend a concert by the flamboyant Mr. Orient. From there, they begin stalking him, although stalking was not in vogue in 1964. They become his ardent admirers, believing what magazines write about him, and hanging around outside his Park Avenue apartment, dressed in Chinese hats.Henry Orient, of course, is a no-talent, no-good playboy, who is having an affair with the married and somewhat reluctant Stella Dunworthy, well played by Paula Prentiss. It seems that Henry Orient spends most of his days sleeping, talking on his futuristic phone, and chasing women.It is all an innocent pursuit for the girls, whose friendship is really the center of the film. This is very well portrayed, and backed with gorgeous New York scenery. The trust of the girls is severely tested, and we see the change from wide-eyed innocence, to devastating disappointment.Angela Lansbury plays a completely despicable society hound, showing her great range as the actress new generations recognize as the sweet Jessica Fletcher. Peter Sellers, as always, moves into his character completely, and switches from sauve to clueless in a matter of minutes.This is a wonderful film, very entertaining, and based on a book of the same name.

347207,A5ZJFVV0564T6,6302946492,"Ilona Novotny ""Eccentric""","[8, 8]","""The World of Henry Orient"" holds a very special place in my heart. It reminds me of myself and my friends when we were in school, in the early `70s. We're still friends, by the way!  Secondly, it was filmed in New York City, where we went to school. ""Henry Orient"" is one of those special films about kids ""coming of age"" that treads a very fine line, where one false situation or characterization or line of dialogue could easily sink it into maudlin sappiness, which, thank goodness, it never does. Two New York City schoolgirls, one from a happy, middle-class single parent home, the other from a wealthy but unhappy home, meet, become friends, and through a series of coincidences, cross paths with Henry Orient, a mediocre concert pianist who is something of a Don Juan. The girls begin to fan-worship Henry, wearing coolie hats, talking ""Orient speak"", and the usual adolescent mishigas that most of us go through. Their antics eventually lead to misadventures, and a fateful meeting between the rich girl's mother and Henry that leads to adultery, an imminent divorce, and a bonding between the girl and her father, who had been absent for most of her young life.Nora Johnson wrote the screenplay for ""Henry Orient"", which she adapted from her book, and did an admirable job. She has a great understanding of teenage girls (well, she was one once!), and the girls' dialogue is particularly memorable and genuine. The cast is great. Peter Sellers plays Henry as a second-rate Lothario, whose ""Continental"" accent occasionally slips away, revealing his original, heavy Brooklynese accent, a sort of Pepe lePew by way of Bensonhurst. `Tippy' Walker as rich girl Valerie Boyd and Merrie Spaeth as Marian Gilbert are charming, talented girls. They are the stars of film. I always felt like I knew them. Perennial ""kooky"" actress Paula Prentiss is her usual funny self as Stella Dunnworthy, a married nervous nellie who never consummates her would-be illicit affair with  Henry. Phyllis Thaxter and the late Bibi Osterwald are likeable and warm as Marian's mom and her best friend, Boothy, and Tom Bosley is remarkably believable as Valerie's dad.  Character actors Al ""Grandpa Munster"" Lewis as a concerned shopowner, and John Fiedler as Henry's manager lend great support. And now, we come to the remarkable Angela Lansbury as Isabel Boyd, Valerie's promiscuous but not-too-lovable mother. For years I had convinced myself that I didn't like Angela Lansbury, based on how convincingly she played the cold-as-ice Isabel Boyd. This is the proof of a really talented actress.  This was in the  ""monster mothers"" phase of her career, along with her evil mother In ""The Manchurian Candidate"". What an amazing lady! I also must give credit where credit is due to Elmer Bernstein, for his sweet and heartbreaking musical score for this film. It is considered, along with his other great ""kid"" score for ""To Kill a Mockingbird"", one of his greatest.""The World of Henry Orient"" is a very fond, nostalgic tribute to the innocence of youngsters, particularly girls, before imminent adulthood comes into their lives and shatters their youthful fantasies. It is also a fond reminder of a very different New York City, seen through rose-coloured glasses perhaps, but aren't nice memories like that anyway?The picture and sound quality on this DVD are great. I had never seen ""Henry Orient"" in widescreen, so this was a particular treat. The colors are rich and vibrant, the picture razor sharp. There is only one ""extra"" feature on the DVD, the original theatrical trailer, and there isn't a program inside the case, but for this price, who's complaining?

347208,A106016KSI0YQ,6302946492,Jay Dickson,"[9, 9]","George Roy Hill's THE WORLD OF HENRY ORIENT is an absolutely one-of-a-kind work that almost defies categorization. It might be considered a kind of comic antecedent to HEAVENLY CREATURES: two well-to-do young teenagers from broken homes find solace in their mutual fantasies of a second-rate celebrity pianist, the libidinous and scheming Henry Orient (Peter Sellars). Innocently following him all over Manhattan, they unwittingly wreak utter havoc in his life, especially in his attempts to seduce a nervous suburban housewife (inspiringly played by Paula Prentiss).Mostly the film is a kind of paean to girlish infatuation, and allows Hill to show his great gift with younger actors (Merrie Spaeth and Tippy Walker as the teenagers are extremely winning). The latter part of the film--involving Walker's fraught homelife with her ineffectual welathy father (Tom Bosley) and his cuckolding and disagreeable wife (Angela Lansbury)--becomes a bit melodramatic, and yet it remains very memorable nonetheless. It evokes a kind of wealthy Eisenhower vision of Manhattan that doesn't exist anymore and may never have existed, the same Manhattan evoked in J. D. Salinger's novels where a teenage girl can safely wander Central Park at night unmolested and where two women who can afford to share a large two-story brownstone in Greenwich Village can be despised as &quot;middle class.&quot; The film is more amusing and evocative rather than outright funny: still, it has one of the funniest &quot;shaggy dog&quot; sequences of all American films from this period--the great &quot;Jayne Mansfield&quot; sequence, which has an absolutely terrific payoff you'll remember for quite a while afterwards.

347210,A2OD45RK9UM55F,6302946492,Jonathan Rimorin,"[1, 1]","I've come to this movie quite recently, having read somewhere someone's musings about how Wes Anderson must have seen this film and appropriated some of its free-wheeling quirkiness and New-Yorkphilea for his own style. And after watching the Amazon video stream, I concur: not only do ""Royal Tennenbaums"" and ""Moonrise Kingdom"" seem to borrow the 1964 warmth and palette, but the feelings of incipient adulthood and castaway adolescence seem to be sparked from this movie as well. If Tippy Walker had been born forty years later, she would easily find a role in one of Anderson's films as one of his precocious ingenues. Or perhaps he could cast her as a knowing grandmother, or a quirky but profound cat-besotted aunt.Some reviews here complain that though Peter Sellers is the above-the-marquee name, he's not really the subject of the movie. They're right, those angry reviewers. This is Tippy Walker's movie, and it's the attentiveness she brings to the role and the rapt attention the movie gives to her character, her every expression, that gives the picture its peculiar &eacute;lan, its frisson of joy. Some other reviews remark that the camera almost leers at these young girls, particularly in the jumping and ""splitsing"" scene. I don't really agree, or at least it doesn't bother me. Ms Walker has written movingly about how she and the director, George Roy Hill, fell in love during the making of this movie, something which has had an impact upon her for the rest of her life; however, unlike, say, Godard and Anna Karina, Hill's camera doesn't seem to want to possess or overwhelm his subject. It just delights in her liveliness. She had something special.

Lang,"[1, 1]","I'm posting this for two reasons: one, to illustrate that awards and honors don't mean a movie is a winner; two, anyone buying or renting this on the assumption that it's a knee-slapping Peter Sellers comedy (in the vein of Pink Panther) will be very disappointed.  I learned after watching this that it was the US's entry in the Cannes Festival the year of its release?  Mercy?  This was the best America could come up with for Cannes?  No way.  As for the comedy, Sellers is really a supporting player here, despite his being the title character.  The story focuses on two fourteen-year-old girls, both with absent father syndrome, getting a crush on Henry Orient, a conceited, philandering, and not-so-talented pianist composer who keeps attempting to consummate his affair with a married woman (Paula Prentiss), but is always interrupted by the two girls.  He becomes so paranoid that he's convinced they've been hired as spies by the married woman's husband.  The movie is more a coming-of-age story than a comedy. More interesting that Sellers are Angela Lansbury as the rich (and adulterous) mother of one of the two girls, and Tom Bosley playing - this will shock you - an Understanding Dad.Not a bad way to spend 2 hours, but don't expect too many belly laughs or too much screen time for Sellers.  The best scene in the movie is Sellers's concert performance with an orchestra, with him being as histrionic and pretentious as possible, while the conductor and orchestra members bite their lips in frustration. His lame attempt to seduce Paul Prentiss with a god-awful song describing her physical charms is also very funny.",3,This was America's entry at Cannes???,1385683200,"11 29, 2013",2013,1633,"[""'m"", 'posting', 'two', 'reasons', 'one', 'illustrate', 'awards', 'honors', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'movie', 'winner', 'two', 'anyone', 'buying', 'renting', 'assumption', 'knee-slapping', 'Peter', 'Sellers', 'comedy', 'vein', 'Pink', 'Panther', 'will', 'be', 'very', 'disappointed', 'learned', 'watching', 'was', 'US', 'entry', 'Cannes', 'Festival', 'year', 'release', 'Mercy', 'was', 'best', 'America', 'could', 'come', 'up', 'Cannes', 'way', 'comedy', 'Sellers', 'really', 'supporting', 'player', 'here', 'being', 'title', 'character', 'story', 'two', 'fourteen-year-old', 'girls', 'absent', 'father', 'syndrome', 'getting', 'crush', 'Henry', 'Orient', 'conceited', 'philandering', 'not-so-talented', 'pianist', 'composer', 'who', 'attempting', 'consummate', 'affair', 'married', 'woman', 'Paula', 'Prentiss', 'always', 'interrupted', 'two', 'girls', 'so', 'paranoid', 'convinced', ""'ve"", 'been', 'hired', 'spies', 'married', 'woman', 'husband', 'movie', 'more', 'coming-of-age', 'story', 'comedy', 'More', 'interesting', 'Sellers', 'are', 'Angela', 'Lansbury', 'rich', 'adulterous', 'mother', 'one', 'two', 'girls', 'Tom', 'Bosley', 'playing', 'will', 'shock', 'Understanding', 'Dad.Not', 'bad', 'way', 'spend', '2', 'hours', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'too', 'many', 'belly', 'too', 'much', 'screen', 'time', 'Sellers', 'best', 'scene', 'movie', 'Sellers', 'concert', 'performance', 'orchestra', 'being', 'histrionic', 'pretentious', 'possible', 'conductor', 'orchestra', 'members', 'bite', 'lips', 'frustration', 'lame', 'attempt', 'seduce', 'Paul', 'Prentiss', 'god-awful', 'song', 'describing', 'physical', 'charms', 'also', 'very', 'funny']",N/A
347212,A5PGGHYHIDYA5,6302946492,Kenton Couch,"[8, 8]","From its beginning as a first book by the young Nora Johnson, daughter of the great screenwriter, Nunnally Johnson, ""The World of Henry Orient"" was a labor of love for all who worked on it. Nora's father adapted the book into a screenplay, and then the excellent director, George Roy Hill, transformed it into one of the better movies ever made.I'm so glad this movie was made at the right time (1964), when cinema still relied on a good story, well told. I firmly believe this film couldn't, or wouldn't,  be made today. Hollywood, with a few outstanding exceptions, now seems content to churn out major productions built on wow-me special effects, formulaic plots, infantile characters, and sophomoric dialogue. But that wasn't the case in 1964, and it certainly wasn't the case with ""The World of Henry Orient.""Every aspect of this film is exceptional: The cinematography, with its innovative camera angles, beautifully depicts the special world of the two adolescent girls, who are the film's main characters, and also gives us a lovely panorama of New York City before its decay. You can watch ""The World of Henry Orient"" for its scenic selections and camera work alone, and learn more than in most modern movies.Not only are the scenic selections used to show the passage of time, they are also carefully correlated with what is happening emotionally in the script.Listen to the movie's musical score: There is a lovely primary melody depicting the youthful spirit of the two girls. When the movie becomes darker, more solemn orchestration overlays the primary score, but it is never abandoned. It lurks beneath the surface, ready, like the inherent optimism and resilience of youth, to break out.The script, based on Nora Johnson's excellent book, wonderfully communicates a lovely picture of the emotions and innocent fantasies of the two girls' adolescent world, and then shows what happens when that world is intruded upon by the petty and sordid behavior of some of the adults in the movie. The masterful blending of these opposing elements creates a light, airy comedy that is also a poignant drama. It is very rare for one movie to combine so many of the elements a great film should have, but ""The World of Henry Orient"" does.You won't find better acting than in ""The World of Henry Orient."" Mr. Hill allows Tippy Walker and Merrie Spaeth the freedom to create their charming characters, and they do so magnificently. These two young actors almost steal the show from some of the finest performers of our time. It is a credit to Mr. Hill that each character in the movie is perfectly drawn and marvelously performed.Thank you, Angela Lansbury, for beautifully playing what must have been a hideous role to perform. Bravo, Tom Bosley, for perfectly portraying a father who has aquired everything but the wisdom to receive his daughter's love.I will forever smile when I think of the wonderfully phony Peter Sellers, and I will always treasure the most lovely Paula Prentiss' halarious performance of a neurotic on steroids. Thank you Phyllis Thaxter, Bibi Osterwald, John Fielder, Al Lewis, Peter Duchan, and many others for your fine acting. Oh, when you watch the film, look for the cameo appearance by Jack Benny; he is one of the members of the ochestra.""The World of Henry Orient"" will always hold a most special place in my heart. The girls will always be young. Peter Sellers will never cease pursuing the beguiling Paula Prentiss, and Tom Bosley will forever just have learned how to be a father to his child.What I really want to say in this review is thanks to all of you who gave us this treasure. You did an outstanding job, and you can be very proud of what you created.

Swanson,"[0, 2]","2.3 starsWe're in the process of watching every Sellers film from the start of his career on up, and this is by a wide margin the most boring of the lot. His role is very minor, maybe 20 minutes on screen out of the movie's 105, and it's somewhat funny, but only mildly. If you're checking this out for Sellers, move on to Heavens Above, etc. They marketed this on vhs/dvd as his movie, but he's a minor figure overall: yet another typical example of studio greed and duplicity. The misleading cover photo suggests Sellers is the main character, though he's hardly even in the movie compared to the two girls. That's fraud, pretty much. And studios complain about piracy? They're the real scammers.This is in fact a kid's movie, from the constant focus on the girls and their fantasy world to their generally juvenile delight in everything, even after ""discovering"" boys/men. The highlight here is the early '60s New York locales; Central Park looks mighty inviting, Washington Square is squeaky clean, and the town in general rarely looked better on screen. But besides that, this thing draaaaagged for us to the point of extreme boredom. Lansbury was ok, and Bosley plays Richie's C's ever-kind Dad years before Happy Days, but all in all this seemed made for pubescent girls, NOT their parents. Which is fine, but don't market this on the cover as a Peter Sellers movie. It ain't, squire!And may I add, as one other reviewer who was excoriated for it here also did, that there are more than just a few shots up the girls' skirts in this film. As in, dozens of panty shots, to the point where we started looking at each other and wondering exactly why director Hill was only interested in low angles when the little girls were on screen. Check it out for yourself. It's pervy after a while, and this is probably on any pedo's top ten Hollywood film list. My girlfriend loves the old Heidi movies, and those films make sure to avoid these sort of panty shots, whereas this film looks for every chance to show them. That can't be a coincidence. She noticed first, and once she mentioned it, I observed how it was almost the director's goal in many shots; makes one wonder about Hill's motives. No director would shoot all those shots without meaning to. More than weird, to say the least. The whole film has a Disneyish feel to it, so that aspect really stands out after a while. And combined with the boredom ensuing from the girls' endless, juvenile chattering, it grates.That's the real issue here: the endless nature of the girls' scheming and gossiping. Might be fun to watch if you're a young girl, or have a special fondness for watching them and their panties, but for us this got extremely boring very quickly, and we were almost falling asleep waiting for Sellers to show up, and he wasn't very funny when he did. Not bad, but nowhere near his best. The script just didn't give him enough to do. Maybe if he'd worn a skirt, Hill would have used him more.After reading all the raves here we expected greatness; instead we got mostly endless boredom watching a movie made for teens, not for Peter Sellers fans. All in all, I wouldn't watch this again if you paid me.",2,"NOT a Sellers film, really; incredibly overrated here..we were bored to tears, and even PS (in a tiny role) couldn't save it",1268006400,"03 8, 2010",2010,3174,"['2.3', 'starsWe', ""'re"", 'process', 'watching', 'Sellers', 'film', 'start', 'career', 'wide', 'margin', 'most', 'boring', 'lot', 'role', 'very', 'minor', 'maybe', '20', 'minutes', 'screen', 'movie', '105', 'somewhat', 'funny', 'only', 'mildly', ""'re"", 'checking', 'out', 'Sellers', 'move', 'Heavens', 'Above', 'etc', 'marketed', 'vhs/dvd', 'movie', 'minor', 'figure', 'overall', 'yet', 'typical', 'example', 'studio', 'greed', 'duplicity', 'misleading', 'cover', 'photo', 'Sellers', 'main', 'character', 'hardly', 'even', 'movie', 'compared', 'two', 'girls', 'fraud', 'pretty', 'much', 'studios', 'complain', 'piracy', ""'re"", 'real', 'scammers.This', 'fact', 'kid', 'movie', 'constant', 'focus', 'girls', 'fantasy', 'world', 'generally', 'juvenile', 'delight', 'everything', 'even', 'discovering', 'boys/men', 'highlight', 'here', 'early', 'New', 'York', 'Central', 'Park', 'mighty', 'inviting', 'Washington', 'Square', 'squeaky', 'clean', 'town', 'general', 'rarely', 'looked', 'better', 'screen', 'thing', 'draaaaagged', 'point', 'extreme', 'boredom', 'Lansbury', 'was', 'ok', 'Bosley', 'Richie', 'C', 'ever-kind', 'Dad', 'years', 'Happy', 'Days', 'seemed', 'made', 'pubescent', 'girls', 'NOT', 'parents', 'Which', 'fine', 'do', ""n't"", 'market', 'cover', 'Peter', 'Sellers', 'movie', 'ai', ""n't"", 'squire', 'may', 'add', 'one', 'other', 'reviewer', 'who', 'was', 'excoriated', 'here', 'also', 'did', 'are', 'more', 'just', 'few', 'shots', 'girls', 'skirts', 'film', 'dozens', 'panty', 'shots', 'point', 'where', 'started', 'looking', 'other', 'wondering', 'exactly', 'why', 'director', 'Hill', 'was', 'only', 'interested', 'low', 'angles', 'when', 'little', 'girls', 'were', 'screen', 'Check', 'out', 'pervy', 'while', 'probably', 'pedo', 'top', 'ten', 'Hollywood', 'film', 'list', 'girlfriend', 'old', 'Heidi', 'movies', 'films', 'make', 'sure', 'avoid', 'sort', 'panty', 'shots', 'film', 'chance', 'show', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'coincidence', 'noticed', 'first', 'once', 'mentioned', 'observed', 'how', 'was', 'almost', 'director', 'goal', 'many', 'shots', 'one', 'wonder', 'Hill', 'motives', 'director', 'would', 'shoot', 'shots', 'meaning', 'More', 'weird', 'say', 'least', 'whole', 'film', 'Disneyish', 'feel', 'aspect', 'really', 'out', 'while', 'combined', 'boredom', 'ensuing', 'girls', 'endless', 'juvenile', 'chattering', 'real', 'issue', 'here', 'endless', 'nature', 'girls', 'scheming', 'gossiping', 'Might', 'be', 'fun', 'watch', ""'re"", 'young', 'girl', 'have', 'special', 'fondness', 'watching', 'panties', 'got', 'extremely', 'boring', 'very', 'quickly', 'were', 'almost', 'falling', 'asleep', 'waiting', 'Sellers', 'show', 'up', 'was', ""n't"", 'very', 'funny', 'when', 'did', 'Not', 'bad', 'nowhere', 'best', 'script', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'give', 'enough', 'do', 'Maybe', ""'d"", 'worn', 'skirt', 'Hill', 'would', 'have', 'used', 'more.After', 'reading', 'raves', 'here', 'expected', 'greatness', 'instead', 'got', 'mostly', 'endless', 'boredom', 'watching', 'movie', 'made', 'teens', 'not', 'Peter', 'Sellers', 'fans', 'would', ""n't"", 'watch', 'again', 'paid']",N/A

347216,A1OCVWN4K4Q3FN,6302946492,M. Keogh,"[7, 8]","This is just simply a very sweet and fun movie!  As others have noted, if you watch it in the belief that it's a Peter Sellers movie then you're going to be disappointed.  While Sellers' character is crucial to the film, he's not the star.  The stars of the film are two teenage actresses- Tippy Walker as ""Valarie 'Val' Boyd and Merrie Spaeth as ""Marian 'Gil' Gilbert.""  It's amazing that this movie was the debut for both- they just seem so natural.  (It's also surprising that neither acted much afterwards.)Gil and Val are two girls who have reached an age in which they're too old for toys, but too young for boys.  Further, they're young teens living during what John Waters has described as ""that weird time that was after Elvis, but before The Beatles.""  As Gil and Val struggle to adjust to their growing sense of maturity, they find comfort in a self-created fantasy world with Manhattan as the background to their flights of whimsy.  (I've lived in Manhattan for ten years, and I wish it looked as half as good as it is filmed here.)  By chance the girls find an object that becomes the intense focus for all their innocent romantic fantasies- Henry Orient (Sellers), an avant garde concert pianist of dubious talent who seems a lot more intersted in attempting to make married women ""hum"" than improving his non-Van Cliburn skills.Sellers' Orient is a truly unique character.  Born and raised in Brooklyn, he's adapted a pretentious non-descript Continental accent especially when wooing women, but when he gets flustered his native Brooklynese escapes his lips.  And Val and Gil certainly fluster Mr. Orient as they follow him around town, completely oblivious to the havoc that they're wreaking on his love life.The movie also delves into the home life of these two girls.  Gil, despite her parents being divorced, lives in a stable upper middle class home with her mom and her mom's friend.  On the other hand, Val's very wealthy and very busy parents (played by Tom Bosely and Angela Lansbury) are still married, but far from happily.  Eventually, Val's unhappy family life will interfere with her joyous fantasy world and bring it crashing down.Overall, this is just a very nice film about both the joy of being young and the difficulty of growing up.  I enjoyed it because of the acting and its endearing story.  I also enjoy it because it makes Manhattan in the early 60's look like such a great place to live- how nicely everyone is dressed and how clean the city looks!",4,A fun movie about growing up,1141344000,"03 3, 2006",2006,2490,"['just', 'simply', 'very', 'sweet', 'fun', 'movie', 'others', 'have', 'noted', 'watch', 'belief', 'Peter', 'Sellers', 'movie', 'then', ""'re"", 'going', 'be', 'disappointed', 'Sellers', 'character', 'crucial', 'film', 'not', 'star', 'stars', 'film', 'are', 'two', 'teenage', 'actresses-', 'Tippy', 'Walker', 'Valarie', ""'Val"", 'Boyd', 'Merrie', 'Spaeth', 'Marian', ""'Gil"", 'Gilbert', 'amazing', 'movie', 'was', 'debut', 'both-', 'just', 'seem', 'so', 'natural', 'also', 'surprising', 'neither', 'acted', 'much', 'afterwards', 'Gil', 'Val', 'are', 'two', 'girls', 'who', 'have', 'reached', 'age', ""'re"", 'too', 'old', 'toys', 'too', 'young', 'boys', 'Further', ""'re"", 'young', 'teens', 'living', 'what', 'John', 'Waters', 'described', 'weird', 'time', 'was', 'Elvis', 'Beatles', 'Gil', 'Val', 'struggle', 'adjust', 'growing', 'sense', 'maturity', 'find', 'comfort', 'self-created', 'fantasy', 'world', 'Manhattan', 'background', 'flights', 'whimsy', ""'ve"", 'lived', 'Manhattan', 'ten', 'years', 'wish', 'looked', 'as', 'half', 'as', 'good', 'filmed', 'here', 'chance', 'girls', 'find', 'object', 'intense', 'focus', 'innocent', 'romantic', 'fantasies-', 'Henry', 'Orient', 'Sellers', 'avant', 'garde', 'concert', 'pianist', 'dubious', 'talent', 'who', 'lot', 'more', 'intersted', 'attempting', 'make', 'married', 'women', 'hum', 'improving', 'non-Van', 'Cliburn', 'skills.Sellers', 'Orient', 'truly', 'unique', 'character', 'Born', 'raised', 'Brooklyn', 'adapted', 'pretentious', 'non-descript', 'Continental', 'accent', 'especially', 'when', 'wooing', 'women', 'when', 'flustered', 'native', 'Brooklynese', 'lips', 'Val', 'Gil', 'certainly', 'fluster', 'Mr.', 'Orient', 'follow', 'around', 'town', 'completely', 'oblivious', 'havoc', ""'re"", 'wreaking', 'love', 'life.The', 'movie', 'also', 'home', 'life', 'two', 'girls', 'Gil', 'parents', 'being', 'divorced', 'stable', 'upper', 'middle', 'class', 'home', 'mom', 'mom', 'friend', 'other', 'hand', 'Val', 'very', 'wealthy', 'very', 'busy', 'parents', 'played', 'Tom', 'Bosely', 'Angela', 'Lansbury', 'are', 'still', 'married', 'far', 'happily', 'Eventually', 'Val', 'unhappy', 'family', 'life', 'will', 'interfere', 'joyous', 'fantasy', 'world', 'bring', 'crashing', 'down.Overall', 'just', 'very', 'nice', 'film', 'joy', 'being', 'young', 'difficulty', 'growing', 'up', 'enjoyed', 'acting', 'endearing', 'story', 'also', 'enjoy', 'Manhattan', 'early', '60', 'look', 'great', 'place', 'live-', 'how', 'nicely', 'everyone', 'dressed', 'how', 'clean', 'city']",N/A
347217,A30LMTLC9XVWKJ,6302946492,Only-A-Child,"[9, 10]","George Roy Hill gets my vote for most underrated director. I don't know if it was intentional but Hill seems to have specialized in directing extremely difficult films (""Slaughterhouse Five"", ""The World According to Garp"", ""The Sting"", and ""Slap Shot"") and did them all quite well. ""The World of Henry Orient"" (1964) certainly falls into this difficult category as his two inexperienced young stars were featured in almost every scene and alternated between location shooting and studio sound stage work.This will probably be regarded as Hill's best film, not because it is technically perfect but because few (if any) films have successfully interpreted an ambitious screenplay in such a subtle and lyrical manner.It is a story seen from the point-of-view of two 14-year old girls who the viewer first meets at the moment they first meet each other. Gil (Merrie Spaeth) and Val (Elizabeth Walker in an extraordinarily good performance) are prep school students in New York City who immediately connect despite coming from very different backgrounds and being in different developmental stages. What distinguishes this from most film friendships is that both are loners who are comfortable enough with each other to maintain their own individuality, even dressing differently.Hill managed to put the two young actresses at ease in front of the camera and to capture their natural energy, this is what gives their characters an unexpected authenticity. I was struck by the true-to-life qualities of these two girls.They keep accidentally bumping into the title character, a vain concert pianist (Peter Sellers), and become his youngest fans. Dressed in Chinese hats (insert ""Orient"" here), the two girls stake out his apartment. He is engaged in a long-term and frustratingly unsuccessful attempt to seduce an ultra-paranoid married woman, nervous Stella Dunnworthy (Paula Prentiss). Henry and Stella fuel each other's paranoia and finally convince themselves that Stella's husband is employing the girls as detectives.The film's funniest scene occurs when Gil and Val convince Al Lewis (Grandpa Munster) that their mother is Jayne Mansfield.""The World of Henry Orient"" is the only film I know of that takes the world of 13 and 14 year-old girls seriously. ""Ghost World"" (which placed a ""Henry Orient"" poster on the wall of Enid's bedroom), New Waterford Girl, and ""Times Square"" could be considered sequels-stories, what Gil and Val would become a couple years into the future when they were a couple years older and a little worn down by the additional experience with the world. It's also the first credible portrayal of the effects of divorce and parental neglect on children.""The World of Henry Orient"" is more a coming of age story than a comedy although it does have some comic moments. Most of these involve the title character played by Peter Sellers. But don't expect the over-the-top performances of the older Sellers, his Henry Orient is more along the eccentrically restrained lines of his Fred Kite-trade union leader character in ""I'm All Right Jack"". Paula Prentiss is also quite funny in a restrained portrayal.Ultimately it is Hill's subtlety and nuance that are most memorable. Watch the expressions change on Gil's face as Val takes her on a fantasy trip involving the ""wished for"" return of her father in time for Christmas. Val quickly moves on to another subject as Gil quietly finishes processing the dream.Tom Bosley is especially good as Frank Boyd, Val's father. He does not appear until midway into the film. You learn that he has long doubted that he is actually Val's biological father and has kept the father- daughter relationship distanced, with both parents constantly traveling and Val left at school. With minimal dialogue Bosley shows Frank's slow realization that he loves his daughter more than anything in the world, despite his earlier doubts.This leads to one of cinema's most amazing climatic scenes, coming unexpectedly at least 10 minutes before the actual ending. Val returns home after accidentally discovering that her mother (Angela Lansbury) and Henry are having an affair. Although she does not reveal this to her father, watch how Hill almost wordlessly illustrates the climatic revelations and the process of father and daughter finally finding each other. This visual narrative is why film is so powerful in the hands of a skilled and visionary director like Hill.This is a nice 16x9 print that could greatly benefit from captioning as the audio track is quite poor.Then again, what do I know?

It is a bit odd, in a way, because Peter Sellers' presence indicates a certain type of picture--and in some ways it is.  But what resonates most for me in this picture is the story of the friendship of the two girls, wonderfully played by the young actresses.  Val is really a heartbreaking character and Tippy Walker's performance is really quite remarkable.I saw this movie for the first time on TCM relatively recently and I might love it even more if I had seen it when it first came out.  It is very similar in some ways to another movie of the same era that I did see, as a youngster, when it did come out: ""The Trouble with Angels"".The core of both movies is the deep friendship between two girls who are in many ways disimilar but have a sort of loneliness that draws them to each other.  One of each of these pairs is effected and respond (but in different ways) by what can only be described as parental neglect--and they are both very bright and creative. In both movies, the more serious story is interspersed by blatently comedic scenes (Peter Sellers in this one, the girls' pranks in TTWA).The adult characters are well drawn (also in both movies) and their actions deeply affect the girls.  In both movies, there is sophistication in the stories of the adults (the parents in this one, Mother Superior in TTW) that will be above younger viewers although it won't prevent them from enjoying the movie--but it makes the films more enjoyable for adults!In both movies, the broad comedy is, at least for me, the least successful element of the films while the human stories are deeply effecting.

Peter Sellers, one of the most brialliant actors ever, does his best here and there are some funny moments but mostly even his act falls flat.  I don't know if this was a fault of the director or if the things we thought were hilarious then just aren't as funny anymore.  Paula Prentiss, too, whom I remember a wonderful comedienne, was simply silly here.  Maybe being gawky and neurotic was funny then...?The story is really about two supposedly pre-pubescent girls (although they are played by actresses who are 16 and 17, which shows).  As another reviewer suggested this would be a great Disney type film aimed at young girls.  Bringing Sellers and Prentiss into it just confuses the aim of the film. They were big stars at the time so they brought people to the theaters.Angela Landsbury and Tom Bosley appear and perform their roles adequately. It's sort of interesting to see Landsbury in her younger days.  Bosley plays the same good dad that he did on Happy Days. The star of the film, in my opinion, is Tippy Walker whose natural charm light up every scene in which she appears.  The other actress, whose name I've forgotten is dull and dreay compared to her, but that serves the story.New York looks good and it's interesting to see the clothes of the time.

347220,A1SVXJZ3386U2D,6302946492,Randy Keehn,"[7, 8]","The other day I watched ""Lolita"" for the first time.  I was bothered somewhat by the farcical movie about a 50 year old man's relationship with a 14 year old girl.  It struck me that it is far easier to laugh at a comedy about a pre-teen girl's crush on a middle-aged man.  Peters Sellers happened to play an important supporting role in both movies and both afforded him an opportunity to display his many talents.  In ""The World of Henry Orient"" he is the title character but the movie is more about the home life of a couple of 12 year old girls.  That actually caught me off guard because I thought the movie would focus on Sellers.  However, the real story made for a better overall movie.When a young person fantasizes a love affair with an older man, it often means that there is a need for something that's missing at home.  ""TWOHO"" does a subtle but effective way of bring this out.  While we laugh our way to the climax, we are made to understand that love is more important than obsession and that real love is commitment; not passion.  I was quite please with how the movie ended.Peter Sellers is one of the great actors of the 1960's and he has his own following yet today.  However, while I enjoyed his role in  TWOHO, I expected to.  The actor that caught me by surprize was Tom Bosley.  I have seen him in many movies and seemingly forever in ""Happy Days"" on TV.  His acting in this movie was on a level I had not seen before and I was impressed.""The World of Henry Orient"" was another one of those movies that got less attention than it deserved.

347221,A387BD735MI50R,6302946492,R. Schultz,"[14, 14]","This movie makes my list of the top-ten best of all time. It's too bad it is so little known.It is the only movie I've seen that gets youth right. It shows what it is like to have a ""crush"" - to love someone from afar, innocently, absolutely. This sort of enthusiasm is so central to the heart of being young, especially of being a girl - yet I have never seen it portrayed anywhere else. In the fifties and sixties we had blander teens, preoccupied with little home and school crises - like who was going to take whom to the prom. In recent decades we have been bombarded with sitcom teens, sexually precocious, spouting know-it-all one-liners. In between those two stereotypes of teens, there is the truth - what The World of Henry Orient is about.Boyd is the ""genius"" who sparks to Henry Orient (played by Peter Sellers) first. Orient is a second-rate concert pianist performing for a season in New York. Boyd is not blind to his shortcomings. She admits he ""needs practice."" But she is smitten with him nonetheless. She brings her friend into the adoration. The two girls romp through New York together, following their idol, collecting his discarded cigarette butts (""No filters. He's not scared!""), studying him from a distance - then going back to their rooms to worship him in Oriental rituals they invent and elaborate themselves.There is no word for what these two girls are up to. We would call it ""stalking"" now. But it's not that. It's at the other end of the spectrum from that sort of malevolence. It's pure eagerness and joy and it's a joy to watch.The movie takes a turn past midpoint though. This could have been an uneasy mix of pathos and slaptstick - but the director and actors carry it off and make a plausible, inevitable blend of the two.The girls are wonderful at capturing the squealing, longing delight of having a crush. Peter Sellers is perfect as the only somewhat talented bounder. Paula Prentiss turns in one of the best comedic performances ever as the highstrung married woman with whom Sellers continues to try to arrange a liaison - against increasing odds as he and Prentiss become convinvced that the little girls following them, cropping up everywhere in pagoda hats, must in fact be spies sent by Prentiss' suspicious husband. Angela Lansbury is a true villainess, a mother who has been so indifferent to her daughter and who knows her so little that she interprets the girl's antics as sexual escapade, sullying and perverting the fun.If you never experienced the sort of sheer gleeful delight these girls enjoy - if your teenage years were spent in the infinitely drearier pastime of all-night keggers - then you missed what youth is all about.

347223,A3RNP5X8ZGZIEI,6302946492,Stephanie De Pue,"[2, 2]","The World of Henry Orient, 1964.  In this New York City-set 107 minute, full color classic romantic comedy, Peter Sellers plays Henry Orient, a madly egocentric, overly amorous, minimally-motivated, avant-garde concert pianist who yearns for some afternoon delight with the very married young Stella Dunnworthy, as played by a luminous Paula Prentiss. But two 14-year old prep school girls who secretly admire Orient start following and harassing him, creating chaos wherever he goes, recording their fantasies in diaries.  The movie, which was directed by a young George Roy Hill, (The Sting), an honored director who would develop a fine light comic touch, was nominated for one Golden Globe, but was not a box office hit.  Hill may not quite have known what to do with this particular script.  And Sellers had released three monster hits that year that were still playing in theaters, the first two Pink Panthers, andDr. Strangelove Or: How I Learned To Stop Worrying And Love The Bomb.The great comic Sellers, who was troubled by a stalking fan during the New York filming of this picture, received sterling support from the adult actors in this film.  Prentiss (Where the Boys Are), was lovely and ditsy as Dunnworthy.  Angela Lansbury played her patented monster mom (The Manchurian Candidate) as Isabel Boyd, mother to one of the prep school girls, Valarie `Val' Campbell Boyd, played by Tippy Walker.  Tom Bosley, (Father Dowling Mysteries: The First Season), played Frank Boyd, Val's sympathetic father.  Phyllis Thaxter played Mrs. Avis Gilbert, and Bibi Osterwald, Erica `Boothy' Booth, who made a home for the other prep school girl, Marian `Gil' Gilbert, as played by Merrie Spaeth.  Popular comic support players John Fiedler played Sidney, and Al Lewis, a store owner.  The well-known society band leader Peter Duchin played Joe Daniels.  Elmer Bernstein wrote the score, his first for a comedy.Mind you, a lifetime of film going has taught me that the actor playing the title character of a film is its star.  And Sellers gets star billing here.  But he's not the film's star.  The girls are, in this coming of age picture.  Perhaps Sellers didn't know how to play well with others.  Or Hill didn't quite know how to handle him.  Or it was in the script, which was written by Nora Johnson, based upon a novel of hers, and Nunnally Johnson, (The Grapes of Wrath;The Dirty Dozen;The Three Faces Of Eve,How To Marry A Millionaire) an honored screenwriter who was her father.  According to IMDb, Nora has explained that the pianist's unusual surname - Orient - was inspired by real-life concert pianist Oscar Levant. (The word ""levant"" means orient in French.) Nora has also said that she and a friend had schoolgirl crushes on Levant.Never mind, Sellers appears to have fun.  He was, of course, a genius at accents.  Here his accent changes from a generic European accent--he does tend to mix up his French and Italian -- to a New York/Brooklyn accent, which was an imitation of Stanley Kubrick's voice. (Kubrick had directed Sellers inLolitaand DR STRANGELOVE.)  The film also captures New York in a lovely, peaceful, clean and safe time, and gives us a nice picture of the prep school world inhabited by the likes of J. D. Salinger's characters.  Worth a look, certainly, for Sellers fans.",3,More a Coming of Age Picture,1372896000,"07 4, 2013",2013,3304,"['World', 'Henry', 'Orient', '1964', 'New', 'York', 'City-set', '107', 'minute', 'full', 'color', 'classic', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'Peter', 'Sellers', 'Henry', 'Orient', 'madly', 'egocentric', 'overly', 'amorous', 'minimally-motivated', 'avant-garde', 'concert', 'pianist', 'who', 'afternoon', 'delight', 'very', 'married', 'young', 'Stella', 'Dunnworthy', 'played', 'luminous', 'Paula', 'Prentiss', 'two', '14-year', 'old', 'prep', 'school', 'girls', 'who', 'secretly', 'admire', 'Orient', 'start', 'following', 'harassing', 'creating', 'chaos', 'wherever', 'recording', 'fantasies', 'diaries', 'movie', 'was', 'directed', 'young', 'George', 'Roy', 'Hill', 'Sting', 'honored', 'director', 'who', 'would', 'develop', 'fine', 'light', 'comic', 'touch', 'was', 'nominated', 'one', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'was', 'not', 'box', 'office', 'hit', 'Hill', 'may', 'not', 'quite', 'have', 'known', 'what', 'do', 'particular', 'script', 'Sellers', 'had', 'released', 'three', 'monster', 'hits', 'year', 'were', 'still', 'playing', 'theaters', 'first', 'two', 'Pink', 'Panthers', 'andDr', 'Strangelove', 'How', 'Learned', 'Stop', 'Worrying', 'Love', 'Bomb.The', 'great', 'comic', 'Sellers', 'who', 'was', 'troubled', 'stalking', 'fan', 'New', 'York', 'filming', 'picture', 'received', 'sterling', 'support', 'adult', 'actors', 'film', 'Prentiss', 'Where', 'Boys', 'Are', 'was', 'lovely', 'ditsy', 'Dunnworthy', 'Angela', 'Lansbury', 'played', 'patented', 'monster', 'mom', 'Manchurian', 'Candidate', 'Isabel', 'Boyd', 'mother', 'one', 'prep', 'school', 'girls', 'Valarie', 'Val', 'Campbell', 'Boyd', 'played', 'Tippy', 'Walker', 'Tom', 'Bosley', 'Father', 'Dowling', 'Mysteries', 'First', 'Season', 'played', 'Frank', 'Boyd', 'Val', 'sympathetic', 'father', 'Phyllis', 'Thaxter', 'played', 'Mrs.', 'Avis', 'Gilbert', 'Bibi', 'Osterwald', 'Erica', 'Boothy', 'Booth', 'who', 'made', 'home', 'other', 'prep', 'school', 'girl', 'Marian', 'Gil', 'Gilbert', 'played', 'Merrie', 'Spaeth', 'Popular', 'comic', 'support', 'players', 'John', 'Fiedler', 'played', 'Sidney', 'Al', 'Lewis', 'store', 'owner', 'well-known', 'society', 'band', 'leader', 'Peter', 'Duchin', 'played', 'Joe', 'Daniels', 'Elmer', 'Bernstein', 'wrote', 'score', 'first', 'comedy.Mind', 'lifetime', 'film', 'going', 'taught', 'actor', 'playing', 'title', 'character', 'film', 'star', 'Sellers', 'star', 'billing', 'here', 'not', 'film', 'star', 'girls', 'are', 'coming', 'age', 'picture', 'Perhaps', 'Sellers', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'play', 'well', 'others', 'Hill', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'know', 'how', 'handle', 'was', 'script', 'was', 'written', 'Nora', 'Johnson', 'based', 'novel', 'hers', 'Nunnally', 'Johnson', 'Grapes', 'Wrath', 'Dirty', 'Dozen', 'Three', 'Faces', 'Eve', 'How', 'Marry', 'A', 'Millionaire', 'honored', 'screenwriter', 'who', 'was', 'father', 'According', 'IMDb', 'Nora', 'explained', 'pianist', 'unusual', 'surname', 'Orient', 'was', 'inspired', 'real-life', 'concert', 'pianist', 'Oscar', 'Levant', 'word', 'levant', 'orient', 'French', 'Nora', 'also', 'said', 'friend', 'had', 'schoolgirl', 'crushes', 'Levant.Never', 'mind', 'Sellers', 'have', 'fun', 'was', 'course', 'genius', 'accents', 'Here', 'accent', 'changes', 'generic', 'European', 'accent', 'tend', 'mix', 'up', 'French', 'Italian', 'New', 'York/Brooklyn', 'accent', 'was', 'imitation', 'Stanley', 'Kubrick', 'voice', 'Kubrick', 'had', 'directed', 'Sellers', 'inLolitaand', 'DR', 'STRANGELOVE', 'film', 'also', 'New', 'York', 'lovely', 'peaceful', 'clean', 'safe', 'time', 'nice', 'picture', 'prep', 'school', 'world', 'inhabited', 'likes', 'J.', 'D.', 'Salinger', 'characters', 'look', 'certainly', 'Sellers', 'fans']",N/A

When he says his lines, it's like he's reading them right off the script. Make-up!  Mr. Bosley's smoking jacket! Take ten! The teen-age girls are adorable, Gilbert's mother and mother's friend are right on the mark, as well.  But Paula Prentiss!
