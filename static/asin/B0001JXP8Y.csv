Richard DeVere, the new owner of Grantleigh Manor Estate is CEO of a major international corporation, and is a man used to getting his way. When Audrey and Richard get together sparks fly. But somewhere along the line, the two realize that their differences complement each other quite well!This is an excellent television series, and a great CD set. Veteran actress Penelope Keith was born to play Audrey, and indeed I have never seen her in another role that fit her so well. Her on-screen chemistry with the excellent Peter Bowles brings a real energy and charm to the show.And a nice thing about this show is that the writers designed to show to not only have a beginning, but an integral ending. It gives the show the feeling of a mini-series or movie. Plus, unlike the Americans, the British are willing to periodically revisit old shows with specials, and this CD set includes the wonderful 2007 Christmas special that reunited many of the original cast.This is an excellent television show, and a just-as-excellent CD set.

Gorman  &#34;Crystalline Structure Moon&#34;,"[1, 2]","this brit-com which began in '78 was a bit old-fashioned (even for its time), very british, and extremely well-done! the humor is a bit dry and reserved, sparking up to a saucy level only occasionally and only for a moment or two. but it is still very funny, charming and easy to love. the premise was inspired by a very real dilemma plaguing England at the time. old family concerns with passing wealth (title families or people with land, grand manors or castles, etc.) were dying off...and with no continuing income, their debts had to be paid by selling their traditional manors, estates or castles....and the nouveau riche (Japanese, arabs or rock stars) were buying these ancestral homes with no regards to the old traditional way of life.enter our heroine, audrey fforbes-hamilton (played to perfection by penelope kieth) who is overjoyed that the passing of her husband will mean she can run her estate the way she wants according to the tradition of her heritage....until she learns she must sell the manor to settle her husband's debts. the manor is bought by nouveau-riche richard devere (played equally as well by peter bowles). he is a self-made millionaire owner of a new supermarket chain who plans to turn the manor into an office complex for his grocery empire, while audrey is reduced to living in a shack at the edge of the estate. sparks fly as audrey constantly rushes over to complain about richard's disregard for tradition and heritage.....of course, audrey's rants are a thin veil disguising her infatuation for the charming, suave new owner.....and richard often bends to audrey's will because he too feels something between them. the clash between the traditional and the new-fangled is the main draw to the show....but the undercurrent of the subtly developing romance of these 2 main characters also draws you in. kieth and bowles have an excellent on-screen chemistry....and you can't help hoping that for all their squabbling, these 2 crazy kids will eventually hit it off and get hitched....again, the humor is a bit dry and reserved.....even for its time it was a bit old-fashioned. however, the premise, the writing, the cast (including richard's czech mother played by daphne heard and brabinger the butler played by john rudling), the episodes, the pacing, the way they balanced the clash between traditional and the new....everything about this show was handled with skill, humor and class....right to the spectacular end. and they couldn't have ended the show any better!this collection included the '70s christmas episode which i'd never seen before...and the 25th anniversary special which i never even knew about. these shows were done with the same great work as all the regular episodes. although i am a big fan of how tv and movies are today, i cannot say enough about how wonderful this old-fashioned brit-com of the late '70s and early '80s was!

808575,A1G56KHOUOFWDW,B0001JXP8Y,"Dianne Foster ""Di""","[48, 51]","Many years ago, I caught the tail-end of one of the latter episodes of TO THE MANOR BORN on PBS and liked what I saw, which was enough to spur me to buy this series on DVD when it became available.  I'm happy I did, it is more than worth the price. The two lead actors, Penelope Keith and Peter Bowles have appeared in many other BBC productions (Rumpole, Good Neighbors). I believe they are married in ""real"" life, and thus a commedic team ala Lucy and Desi or George and Gracie, though not as zany.  Audrey Forbes-Hamilton (Keith) is a sophisticated snob and Richard Devere (Bowles) a self made immigrant whom Audrey deems not in her league, let alone worthy of Grantleigh Estate, her old ancestral home.In the opening episode, the newly widowed Audrey is relishing the thought of being on her own without the husband she did not particularly care for.  We learn in a later episode that the Forbes-Hamilton family has intermarried for generations and this might explain some of the peculiar behavior of Audrey and her Uncle who plays an important role in the last few episodes. Audrey soon discovers her now deceased husband kept a few secrets from her, such as the debt the estate had incurred using the ""old"" methods of managing an estate (keeping hedgerows for example). Devere buys Grantleigh at an auction, outbidding Audrey, who had secured a goodly amount from her relatives for the purpose of keeeping the estate ""in the family"".After losing her home, we soon discover Audrey has taken up residence along with the ancient family butler Brabinger in the ""lodge"", a building on the estate just up the road from the manor house, where the hired help once lived. As Richard's new neighbor, Audrey continues to offer advice on how Grantleigh should be managed according to the rules of 'Noblesse Oblige.'Fans of `Waiting for God' will recognize the actor who plays Audrey's ""fill-in"" butler as the man who played Basil Makepeace (Makepiece?) on the ""Waiting for God"" series. He ""fills in"" when Audrey's own butler is away visiting relatives, although from his appearance it seems he was probably pretty sick and they kept the role open for him. The GOD series was made in the early 1990s when Thatcherite changes were already in place, giving Diana Trent somethig to bash. (For those who may not remember -- Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan shared similar political positions and their legacies are similar:). MANOR was created in the 1980s and in many ways seems to be an attempt to understand and appreciate that not all business people are bad (just some of them) while taking pot shots at the British class system. Is it a coincidence that the ""commoner"" Devere (a miscreant in Audrey's eyes) has made his fortune as a grocer?  Given Margaret Thatcher's origins, this allusion must have had a special appeal in the 1980s. By the end of the series, Audrey has learned a few things from Richard and `All's Well that Ends Well.""I highly recommend this series.

808580,A2VE83MZF98ITY,B0001JXP8Y,"FrKurt Messick ""FrKurt Messick""","[18, 19]","'To the Manor Born' is one of the better Brit-coms, witty and intelligent without being over-the-top or inaccessible. It has an oh-so-British tone to it, deliberately so, as it looks with grace and humour at the clash of cultures in modern Britain, the clash between tradition and modernity (finding out that neither is always what it seems), as well as the clash between social classes. All of this is done in such a light-hearted manor, er, manner, that one scarcely realises the biting and insightful satire that runs alongside the comedic situations.The series begins as Audrey fforbes-Hamilton, a straight-backed, upper-crust woman of breeding who revels in her situation, is celebrating the funeral of her husband (yes, celebrating). Meanwhile, Richard Devere, wealthy (read, nouveau riche) financial officer heading a multinational conglomerate of food stores, arrives in the village in search of a classic gentleman's period home in the English countryside. As Audrey's husband was not one to keep up with the bills, she discovers that she is in fact bankrupt, and is forced to sell the manor. Richard Devere buys it at auction; Audrey is a surprising twist retains the estate's hunting lodge down the road, and the stage is set for the tensions between new homeowner and historical lady of the manor.Supplementing the main characters are Audrey's best friend Marjorie, who variously has designs on Richard Devere, but these are almost always thwarted; Richard's mother, Mrs. Pu (Poluviska, actually, but the name is reduced for ease by Audrey); Ned, the traditional groundskeeper who helps keep the traditions alive with Audrey; and finally, Brabinger, the quintessential English butler, who relocates to the old lodge with his mistress Audrey, and always has a few suprises up his sleeve.There are twenty-one episodes in all from the original series 25 years ago, filmed and broadcast over a two-year period in 1979-1981. These run from the start of Audrey's losing the manor through to her regaining the manor, along with the hand of Richard in marriage, but not by the means often expected throughout the series. Throughout the episodes, Audrey is constantly introduced to 'ordinary life', from having to rely on the National Health for her doctor rather than private-pay, personal service, to having difficulties in shopping in supermarkets (Devere's, as it turns out) and not being able to entertain as she once did, or go on holiday (this makes for perhaps the best episode of the lot, save for the first and final episodes). Meanwhile, Devere gets lessons in being lord of the manor by the ever-present Audrey, who counsels him on everything from horse-purchasing to community responsbilities. Despite his wealth, Audrey says, 'he is still at the bottom of it all a grocer.' This is a biting commentary -- the upper-class disdain for the working class is an undercurrent here, and the entitled/en-nobled folk in Parliament used to insult both Ted Heath and Margaret Thatcher, who were both children of shopkeepers, by using the term 'grocer' to describe them.From the threadbare carpets to the when-we-were-in-India knick-knacks to the church clock that never worked properly, this is a wonderfully crafted comedy trip through a slice of British culture that is both past and future. These are not 'issues' episodes -- 'To the Manor Born' educates by stealth. One might be completely unaware of having been taught ways of acting and being. Grantley Manor is a perfect backdrop (shot in a town with the very English-sounding name of Cricket St. Thomas), and the actors are perfectly selected. Penelope Keith as Audrey fforbes-Hamilton has the kind of mannerisms and deadpan delivery befitting a displaced socialite; Peter Bowles has the blustering presence as a self-assured businessman flustered in his new environment. Old Ned (played by MIchael Bilton) and Brabinger (John Rudling) are perfected cast in both physical type and acting ability. Angela Thorne as Marjorie Frobisher, the life-long friend of Audrey, always in her shadow, is great as the 'straight man' against whom Audrey's humour unfolds.Much to the delight of fans, many of the regulars reunited to produce a Silver Anniversary special, which shows the progress after a quarter of a century for Audrey and Richard, neighbour Marjorie Frobisher, and even the same befuddled rector.There is an earlier DVD release that does not contain the Silver Anniversary special.  If you have that packaging already, you only really need to get the separate DVD of the special.  If, however, you have yet to purchase this gem (or have it on VHS), you would put a real touch of class into your life by getting this series.This is a perfect show, certain to win the heart of any Anglophile.",5,Some are born great...,1221868800,"09 20, 2008",2008,4757,"['Manor', 'Born', 'one', 'better', 'Brit-coms', 'witty', 'intelligent', 'being', 'over-the-top', 'inaccessible', 'oh-so-British', 'tone', 'deliberately', 'so', 'grace', 'humour', 'clash', 'cultures', 'modern', 'Britain', 'clash', 'tradition', 'modernity', 'finding', 'out', 'always', 'what', 'as', 'well', 'clash', 'social', 'classes', 'done', 'such', 'light-hearted', 'manor', 'er', 'manner', 'one', 'scarcely', 'biting', 'insightful', 'satire', 'comedic', 'situations.The', 'series', 'Audrey', 'fforbes-Hamilton', 'straight-backed', 'upper-crust', 'woman', 'breeding', 'who', 'revels', 'situation', 'celebrating', 'funeral', 'husband', 'yes', 'celebrating', 'Meanwhile', 'Richard', 'Devere', 'wealthy', 'read', 'nouveau', 'riche', 'financial', 'officer', 'heading', 'multinational', 'conglomerate', 'food', 'stores', 'arrives', 'village', 'search', 'classic', 'gentleman', 'period', 'home', 'English', 'countryside', 'Audrey', 'husband', 'was', 'not', 'one', 'keep', 'up', 'bills', 'fact', 'bankrupt', 'forced', 'sell', 'manor', 'Richard', 'Devere', 'auction', 'Audrey', 'surprising', 'twist', 'estate', 'hunting', 'lodge', 'road', 'stage', 'set', 'tensions', 'new', 'homeowner', 'historical', 'lady', 'manor.Supplementing', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'Audrey', 'best', 'friend', 'Marjorie', 'who', 'variously', 'designs', 'Richard', 'Devere', 'are', 'almost', 'always', 'thwarted', 'Richard', 'mother', 'Mrs.', 'Pu', 'Poluviska', 'actually', 'name', 'reduced', 'ease', 'Audrey', 'Ned', 'traditional', 'groundskeeper', 'who', 'keep', 'traditions', 'alive', 'Audrey', 'finally', 'Brabinger', 'quintessential', 'English', 'butler', 'who', 'old', 'lodge', 'mistress', 'Audrey', 'always', 'few', 'up', 'sleeve.There', 'are', 'twenty-one', 'episodes', 'original', 'series', '25', 'years', 'ago', 'filmed', 'broadcast', 'two-year', 'period', '1979-1981', 'run', 'start', 'Audrey', 'losing', 'manor', 'regaining', 'manor', 'hand', 'Richard', 'marriage', 'not', 'means', 'often', 'expected', 'series', 'episodes', 'Audrey', 'constantly', 'introduced', ""'ordinary"", 'life', 'having', 'rely', 'National', 'Health', 'doctor', 'rather', 'private-pay', 'personal', 'service', 'having', 'difficulties', 'shopping', 'supermarkets', 'Devere', 'out', 'not', 'being', 'able', 'entertain', 'once', 'did', 'go', 'holiday', 'perhaps', 'best', 'episode', 'lot', 'save', 'first', 'final', 'episodes', 'Meanwhile', 'Devere', 'lessons', 'being', 'lord', 'manor', 'ever-present', 'Audrey', 'who', 'everything', 'horse-purchasing', 'community', 'responsbilities', 'wealth', 'Audrey', 'still', 'bottom', 'grocer', 'biting', 'commentary', 'upper-class', 'disdain', 'working', 'class', 'undercurrent', 'here', 'entitled/en-nobled', 'folk', 'Parliament', 'used', 'insult', 'Ted', 'Heath', 'Margaret', 'Thatcher', 'who', 'were', 'children', 'shopkeepers', 'using', 'term', ""'grocer"", 'describe', 'threadbare', 'when-we-were-in-India', 'knick-knacks', 'church', 'clock', 'never', 'worked', 'properly', 'wonderfully', 'crafted', 'comedy', 'trip', 'slice', 'British', 'culture', 'past', 'future', 'are', 'not', ""'issues"", 'episodes', 'Manor', 'Born', 'educates', 'stealth', 'One', 'might', 'be', 'completely', 'unaware', 'having', 'been', 'taught', 'ways', 'acting', 'being', 'Grantley', 'Manor', 'perfect', 'backdrop', 'shot', 'town', 'very', 'English-sounding', 'name', 'Cricket', 'St.', 'Thomas', 'actors', 'are', 'perfectly', 'selected', 'Penelope', 'Keith', 'Audrey', 'fforbes-Hamilton', 'kind', 'mannerisms', 'deadpan', 'delivery', 'befitting', 'displaced', 'socialite', 'Peter', 'Bowles', 'blustering', 'presence', 'self-assured', 'businessman', 'flustered', 'new', 'environment', 'Old', 'Ned', 'played', 'MIchael', 'Bilton', 'Brabinger', 'John', 'Rudling', 'are', 'perfected', 'cast', 'physical', 'type', 'acting', 'ability', 'Angela', 'Thorne', 'Marjorie', 'Frobisher', 'life-long', 'friend', 'Audrey', 'always', 'shadow', 'great', ""'straight"", 'man', 'whom', 'Audrey', 'humour', 'unfolds.Much', 'delight', 'fans', 'many', 'regulars', 'reunited', 'produce', 'Silver', 'Anniversary', 'special', 'progress', 'quarter', 'century', 'Audrey', 'Richard', 'neighbour', 'Marjorie', 'Frobisher', 'even', 'same', 'befuddled', 'earlier', 'DVD', 'release', 'not', 'contain', 'Silver', 'Anniversary', 'special', 'have', 'packaging', 'already', 'only', 'really', 'need', 'get', 'separate', 'DVD', 'special', 'however', 'have', 'yet', 'purchase', 'gem', 'have', 'VHS', 'would', 'put', 'real', 'touch', 'class', 'life', 'getting', 'series.This', 'perfect', 'show', 'certain', 'win', 'heart', 'Anglophile']",To the Manor Born - The Complete Series

The widow and parvenu interact; hilarity ensues, class and breading are examined.  Social conflicts are abound.  The boredom of the gentrifying British countryside is magnified. The widow and the parvenu fall in love.  A copycat cheap romance novel, perhaps?  No, brilliant British comedy called ""To the Manor Born"".Audrey fforbes-Hamilton (played by Penelope Keith) takes control of her dead husband's home, Grantleigh Manor. She finds that the estate is heavily in debt and that the creditors insist on selling the estate. When the estate is put up for auction, she hopes that the all family members will rally around and raise the money to buy the estate, but she is unable to raise enough. She is horrified when the purchaser turns out to be Richard de Vere (Peter Bowles). De Vere is not only 'a nouveau riche grocer' - he owns a supermarket chain - but a foreigner. The worst thing that can happen to the landed British gentry!  His real name is Bedrich Polouvicki, and both he and his mother, Mrs. Polouvicka (Daphne Heard) are originally from Bratislava, Czechoslovakia. They both take up residence in the manor.Audrey, able to retain only the services of her butler, Brabinger (John Rudling) and her vintage Rolls Royce, buys the Manor's former gatekeeper's lodge (""this rabbit hutch"") which DeVere had originally intended buying before the manor house came on the market. From the ""Old Lodge"" (as it is known) she can keep an eye on developments at the manor. Her best friend Marjory Frobisher (Angela Thorne) also has eyes for Richard. Audrey soon sets about teaching Richard the concept of noblesse oblige and working her way back into the life of the manor, whilst dealing with the awkwardness of maintaining the social graces - and simply keeping body and soul together - without any money. Eventually, Richard develops romantic designs, but Audrey will not consider marriage unless she is mistress of her own fortunes.In due course, Richard is forced to sell the manor to fund a business deal, and he returns to London. Coincidentally, Audrey's rich Uncle Greville (Ballard Berkeley, who played The Major in Fawlty Towers) dies and leaves his fortune to her. So she is able to buy back the manor. Richard is invited to the party to celebrate her good fortune and they agree to marry.Very, very warmly recommended.",5,Brilliant and Classy British Comedy,1145318400,"04 18, 2006",2006,2468,"['rich', 'striking', 'widow', 'poor', 'parvenu', 'purchasing', 'ancestral', 'estate', 'cottage', 'close', 'palatial', 'estate', 'widow', 'parvenu', 'interact', 'hilarity', 'ensues', 'class', 'breading', 'are', 'examined', 'Social', 'conflicts', 'are', 'abound', 'boredom', 'gentrifying', 'British', 'countryside', 'magnified', 'widow', 'parvenu', 'fall', 'love', 'copycat', 'cheap', 'romance', 'novel', 'perhaps', 'No', 'brilliant', 'British', 'comedy', 'called', 'Manor', 'Born', 'fforbes-Hamilton', 'played', 'Penelope', 'Keith', 'control', 'dead', 'husband', 'home', 'Grantleigh', 'Manor', 'estate', 'heavily', 'debt', 'creditors', 'insist', 'selling', 'estate', 'When', 'estate', 'put', 'up', 'auction', 'family', 'members', 'will', 'rally', 'around', 'raise', 'money', 'buy', 'estate', 'unable', 'raise', 'enough', 'horrified', 'when', 'purchaser', 'out', 'be', 'Richard', 'Vere', 'Peter', 'Bowles', 'De', 'Vere', 'not', 'only', 'nouveau', 'riche', 'grocer', 'supermarket', 'chain', 'foreigner', 'worst', 'thing', 'can', 'happen', 'landed', 'British', 'gentry', 'real', 'name', 'Bedrich', 'Polouvicki', 'mother', 'Mrs.', 'Polouvicka', 'Daphne', 'Heard', 'are', 'originally', 'Bratislava', 'Czechoslovakia', 'take', 'up', 'residence', 'manor.Audrey', 'able', 'retain', 'only', 'services', 'butler', 'Brabinger', 'John', 'Rudling', 'vintage', 'Rolls', 'Royce', 'Manor', 'former', 'gatekeeper', 'lodge', 'rabbit', 'hutch', 'DeVere', 'had', 'originally', 'intended', 'buying', 'manor', 'house', 'came', 'market', 'Old', 'Lodge', 'known', 'can', 'keep', 'eye', 'developments', 'manor', 'best', 'friend', 'Marjory', 'Frobisher', 'Angela', 'Thorne', 'also', 'eyes', 'Richard', 'Audrey', 'soon', 'teaching', 'Richard', 'concept', 'noblesse', 'oblige', 'working', 'way', 'back', 'life', 'manor', 'whilst', 'dealing', 'awkwardness', 'maintaining', 'social', 'graces', 'simply', 'keeping', 'body', 'soul', 'together', 'money', 'Eventually', 'Richard', 'romantic', 'designs', 'Audrey', 'will', 'not', 'consider', 'marriage', 'mistress', 'own', 'fortunes.In', 'due', 'course', 'Richard', 'forced', 'sell', 'manor', 'fund', 'business', 'deal', 'London', 'Coincidentally', 'Audrey', 'rich', 'Uncle', 'Greville', 'Ballard', 'Berkeley', 'who', 'played', 'Major', 'Fawlty', 'Towers', 'fortune', 'able', 'buy', 'back', 'manor', 'Richard', 'invited', 'party', 'celebrate', 'good', 'fortune', 'agree', 'marry.Very', 'very', 'warmly', 'recommended']",To the Manor Born - The Complete Series

And the Silver Anniversary Special (2007) even tops the outstanding 3-year sit-com. 1979-1981.The barbs and constant badgering of Audrey (Penelope Keith) with grocer magnate and Grantleigh Manor's new owner, Richard DeVere (Peter Bowles) brings on laughs, not smiles. Oh, sure, there are some tender moments, since Richard actually likes Audrey and wants to be a good laird of the manor, but it's the aristocratic bits of verbal bite from Audrey's mouth that makes the series. Another character pairing just as good is that of Audrey and her friend, Marjory (Angela Thorne). That duo is something very like the past, long-running American teamwork of Johnny Carson & Ed McMahon. Like Ed, Marjory gets her own share of pointed remarks expressed, but the air of Audrey seems never to catch them. It's a stretch, but Aubrey could be likened to an Aristocracy-British-Female version of Steve Martin. Constant fast witty jokes.This series pits the new rich against old wealth. British aristocratic VS Czech/Polish immigrant.  Upstart with a desire to ""fit in"" against 400 years of perfected snobbery. ""He's got the money; I've got the breeding."" That's conflict that made this great sit-com fun for 3 seasons.The series is delightful and has the nostalgic flavor of the decade change from 70's to 80's. Even the canned laughter, at first seeming a disturbance when one is used to mostly watching films rather than TV, becomes acceptable. Subtitles would have been a plus, but not really a must, and the anniversary special disc does have that available.Sharing one of the best barbs from the script is perhaps the best way to recommend this DVD set. After a Grantleigh Manor guest was served a plate of overcooked food, he stated, ""Ah, Emmeridge, excellent. My compliments to the blacksmith.""",5,SO GOOD YOU WILL FORGET IT'S AGE.

M Pyles,"[10, 11]","How could an overbearing snob, a mean-spirited xenophobe, and a woman rejoicing at the untimely death of her husband, be an appealing character?  Penelope Keith in the hands of superb comedy writers is how.  Anyone who, after venting about the inroads immigrants are forging into the English upper crust, can end the tirade with the line ""England for the English, as we always used to say about India"" is a character you're bound to like.While America was riveted to the unlikely romance that was unfolding on ""Cheers"" between Diane and Sam, our friends across the ocean were doing it their way with ""To the Manor Born"".  But there was a key difference.  Neither Diane nor Sam ultimately matured enough to make it work.  The closest they came to self-awareness was in realizing in time that it couldn't work.Audrey (Penelope Keith) travels a different road as her awareness dawns that much of her reliance on heritage and breeding is simply filler for the absence of an abiding love in her life.  The wit and good nature with which she slowly opens herself to this realization is what this wonderful series is all about.

She takes comfort that Grantleigh is purchased by 'one of us' - instead of a rock star or even worse, a foreigner.  The relief is short lived when she discovers that wealthy Englishman is really a nouveau riche Czech-born grocer.  The two quickly develop a love-hate relationship despite the efforts of family and friends to match up the two.Penelope Keith plays the domineering Audrey again displaying the talent for protraying such a character that she first showed in THE GOOD LIFE as Margo.  Ms. Keith manages to find endearing qualities in these women who could so easily be just overbearing cartoons.  Peter Bowles manages to bring the upwardly mobile Richard DeVere to life, walking the fine line between making an interesting sympathetic figure trying to understand all the unwritten rules of county society.As is often the case in British sitcoms this is truly an ensemble cast with each member of the cast turning in stellar performences to make this series a gem to be enjoyed again and again.I highly recommend this series to anyone who enjoys British comedy - this is one of the best.  The material is still fresh despite being 20+ years old.  The extras in this set include a Christmas special, interviews with Penelope Keith and Peter Bowles and four never filmed radio episodes.

The problem isn't so much that I didn't think it was funny, which I didn't, but worse the same predictable situations repeat, and after one disk, you've pretty much seen what there is.  The character played by Penelope Keith is tiresome, in my opinion, but the shows might have seemed a lot funnier in the late 1970's or early 80's when they were made.

808616,A2Z13QAST1E7Q9,B0001JXP8Y,"Tiggah ""the Anglophile""","[15, 15]","To the Manor Born is a thoroughly delightful Britcom co-starring Penelope Keith (Good Neighbours, Executive Stress, No Job for a Lady) as the snooty Audrey fforbes-Hamilton, a strong-willed, opinionated, blue-blood.  The series opens with Audrey, the Lady of Grantleigh Manor, having been brought down a peg or two by the death of her husband, which has necessitated the sale of the Manor (resulting in her having to take up residence in the pokey little lodge on the grounds of the estate).As if having to leave her beloved Grantleigh isn't humiliation enough, Audrey is miffed by the fact that the new Lord of the Manor is a gauche, noveau-riche grocery store magnet--and a foreigner to boot--named Richard DeVere (Peter Bowles (Rumpole of the Bailey, The Irish R.M.)).  Richard is a self-made man who, now that he's got the money, wishes to live the life of a landed, moneyed English gentleman.  But he finds there's more--much more--involved than simply buying a beautiful old Manor, as Audrey is only too quick to point out.As a successful, practical businessman, Richard approaches life from a very different perspective than Audrey, who having lived a life of privilege has never had to work a day.  The tension in the series arises from the radically different perspectives from which each approaches various local issues that arise, and the result is that the two are at loggerheads more often than not.But though Audrey is quick to criticise Richard's lack of taste and his vulgar, profit-oriented motives, he is a handsome and, for all his ""faults"", charming man, and we cannot help noticing a certain jealousy on Audrey's part with respect to other women--a jealousy Audrey herself may not even realise exists (and certainly would never admit to!).  The most frequent ""other woman"" whose plans or aspirations are quashed by Audrey is her best friend, Marjory Frobisher, a dowdy, middle-aged spinster who's positively love-struck by Richard.As for Richard, though Audrey is a constant thorn in his side, thwarting his plans and finding fault with him at every turn, we do see in him a growing admiration and fondness despite himself.  Though his feelings for her are sincere, it must be said that Audrey is the one person who has the class, the connections, and the ability to enable Richard to achieve the acceptance and respect that he, as the Lord of Grantleigh Manor, so desires.  Richard's Czechoslovakian mother (whom Audrey affectionately dubs ""Mrs. Pooh"") recognises class (and the power and open doors that accompany it) when she sees it, and is constantly trying to coax Richard in Audrey's direction.The DVD set contains all twenty 30-minute episodes (which ran from 1979-1981).  Special features include the 30-minute 1979 Christmas special (which should be watched after disc one), plus a 30-minute profile of Penelope Keith (1999), and a 9-minute segment with Peter Bowles discussing the turning point in his career (2000).  In 1997, four new 30-minute audio episodes were written for radio (which was apparently the originally-intended medium for the series), all of which are included on the special features disc, and they are really a treat.  Unfortunately, the role of Richard was not reprised by Peter Bowles; still, the episodes (which take place at a point in time prior to the last episodes in the television series) are just as good as those in the original series, and I personally had no trouble picturing the scenes and characters in my mind's eye.  Finally, there are text-based bios.In conclusion, this thoroughly enjoyable, relaxing series is one of the gentler, cosy comedies, and it's one which I highly recommend to fans of British comedy.",5,An Absolute Delight to Watch and Rewatch!,1104883200,"01 5, 2005",2005,3683,"['Manor', 'Born', 'thoroughly', 'delightful', 'Britcom', 'co-starring', 'Penelope', 'Keith', 'Good', 'Neighbours', 'Executive', 'Stress', 'No', 'Job', 'Lady', 'snooty', 'Audrey', 'fforbes-Hamilton', 'strong-willed', 'opinionated', 'blue-blood', 'series', 'Audrey', 'Lady', 'Grantleigh', 'Manor', 'having', 'been', 'brought', 'down', 'peg', 'two', 'death', 'husband', 'necessitated', 'sale', 'Manor', 'resulting', 'having', 'take', 'up', 'residence', 'pokey', 'little', 'lodge', 'grounds', 'estate', '.As', 'having', 'leave', 'beloved', 'Grantleigh', ""n't"", 'humiliation', 'enough', 'Audrey', 'miffed', 'fact', 'new', 'Lord', 'Manor', 'gauche', 'noveau-riche', 'grocery', 'store', 'magnet', 'foreigner', 'boot', 'named', 'Richard', 'DeVere', 'Peter', 'Bowles', 'Rumpole', 'Bailey', 'Irish', 'R.M.', 'Richard', 'self-made', 'man', 'who', 'now', 'got', 'money', 'live', 'life', 'landed', 'moneyed', 'English', 'gentleman', 'more', 'much', 'more', 'involved', 'simply', 'buying', 'beautiful', 'old', 'Manor', 'Audrey', 'only', 'too', 'quick', 'point', 'out.As', 'successful', 'practical', 'businessman', 'Richard', 'life', 'very', 'different', 'perspective', 'Audrey', 'who', 'having', 'lived', 'life', 'privilege', 'never', 'had', 'work', 'day', 'tension', 'series', 'radically', 'different', 'perspectives', 'various', 'local', 'issues', 'arise', 'result', 'two', 'are', 'loggerheads', 'more', 'often', 'not.But', 'Audrey', 'quick', 'criticise', 'Richard', 'lack', 'taste', 'vulgar', 'profit-oriented', 'motives', 'handsome', 'faults', 'charming', 'man', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'noticing', 'certain', 'jealousy', 'Audrey', 'part', 'respect', 'other', 'women', 'jealousy', 'Audrey', 'may', 'not', 'even', 'realise', 'exists', 'certainly', 'would', 'never', 'admit', 'most', 'frequent', 'other', 'woman', 'plans', 'aspirations', 'are', 'quashed', 'Audrey', 'best', 'friend', 'Marjory', 'Frobisher', 'dowdy', 'middle-aged', 'spinster', 'who', 'positively', 'love-struck', 'Richard.As', 'Richard', 'Audrey', 'constant', 'thorn', 'side', 'thwarting', 'plans', 'finding', 'fault', 'turn', 'do', 'see', 'growing', 'admiration', 'fondness', 'feelings', 'are', 'sincere', 'must', 'be', 'said', 'Audrey', 'one', 'person', 'who', 'class', 'connections', 'ability', 'enable', 'Richard', 'achieve', 'acceptance', 'respect', 'Lord', 'Grantleigh', 'Manor', 'so', 'Richard', 'Czechoslovakian', 'mother', 'whom', 'Audrey', 'affectionately', 'Mrs.', 'Pooh', 'class', 'power', 'open', 'doors', 'accompany', 'when', 'constantly', 'trying', 'coax', 'Richard', 'Audrey', 'direction.The', 'DVD', 'set', 'twenty', '30-minute', 'episodes', 'ran', '1979-1981', 'Special', 'features', 'include', '30-minute', '1979', 'Christmas', 'special', 'should', 'be', 'watched', 'disc', 'one', '30-minute', 'profile', 'Penelope', 'Keith', '1999', '9-minute', 'segment', 'Peter', 'Bowles', 'discussing', 'turning', 'point', 'career', '2000', '1997', 'four', 'new', '30-minute', 'audio', 'episodes', 'were', 'written', 'radio', 'was', 'apparently', 'originally-intended', 'medium', 'series', 'are', 'included', 'special', 'features', 'disc', 'are', 'really', 'treat', 'Unfortunately', 'role', 'Richard', 'was', 'not', 'reprised', 'Peter', 'Bowles', 'still', 'episodes', 'take', 'place', 'point', 'time', 'prior', 'last', 'episodes', 'television', 'series', 'are', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'original', 'series', 'personally', 'had', 'trouble', 'picturing', 'scenes', 'characters', 'mind', 'eye', 'Finally', 'are', 'text-based', 'bios.In', 'conclusion', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyable', 'relaxing', 'series', 'one', 'gentler', 'cosy', 'comedies', 'one', 'highly', 'recommend', 'fans', 'British', 'comedy']",To the Manor Born - The Complete Series

808620,AADN8EWZJCGYZ,B0001JXP8Y,Wayne M. Schmidt,"[14, 16]","Although I'm a diehard fan of this great British sitcom, I can't recommend this particular DVD of it. When I received it I was shocked by the fuzzy quality of the recording. Comparing it side-by-side on the same TV with an old VHS recording I purchased years ago clearly showed that the DVD image quality was much poorer than the VHS. I believe what the makers did was transfer from a second or third generation VHS copy of the original recording to DVD instead of going back to the original. The focus is so soft that both my wife and myself constantly squinted in an effort to sharpen the image, which of course didn't help. I doubt we'll ever watch this DVD because the eyestrain is too great. If you don't have a good copy it would be better than nothing, but not by muchI was also disappointed in the extras. The ""character biographies"" weren't of the characters in the series but of the actors; very misleading. There were no tours of the actual estate used in the series or many of the other additions that would have made this a first rate DVD.The radio broadcasts were interesting, though several different actors were used which degraded the enjoyment. Also, there were only four of the ten radio broadcasts on the DVD. Finally, while you listen to the radio shows only one image is displayed on the TV screen.
