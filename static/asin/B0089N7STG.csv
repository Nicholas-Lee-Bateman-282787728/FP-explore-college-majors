1549143,A3DVS9Y4Z1HIDJ,B0089N7STG,"Bob Lind ""camelwest""","[5, 5]","Diego and Sebastian are two young men who had been good friends when they were young boys, but had not seen each other in some time.  There is an immediate sexual tension between the very shy Diego, who lives with his alcoholic mother, and the more outgoing (and experienced) Sebastian, as they get reacquainted during a lazy summer. Diego is strongly attracted to his friend, and thinks the feeling is mutual, but is too shy to really act on his feelings, despite several opportunities.  Adding a bit of surreal help is Diego's hallucination of a sexy TV pitch-woman, with a hunky male assistant, who periodically appears to him and urges him to act on his feelings and ""enjoy life.""Featured at several gay and international film festivals, this film from Chile is an engaging tale of sexual awakening, in the hands of a capable director, photographer and attractive, talented young cast members.  Explores the often fine line between ""bromance"" and romance, as well as different shades of sexual orientation.  Not rated, but likely would be a soft R for sexual content, though there is no explicit sex or frontal nudity.  In Spanish with English subtitles, this film earns three stars out of five.",3,"Fine line between ""bromance"" and romance ...",1350432000,"10 17, 2012",2012,1199,"['Diego', 'Sebastian', 'are', 'two', 'young', 'men', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'good', 'friends', 'when', 'were', 'young', 'boys', 'had', 'not', 'seen', 'other', 'time', 'immediate', 'sexual', 'tension', 'very', 'shy', 'Diego', 'who', 'alcoholic', 'mother', 'more', 'outgoing', 'experienced', 'Sebastian', 'get', 'reacquainted', 'lazy', 'summer', 'Diego', 'strongly', 'attracted', 'friend', 'feeling', 'mutual', 'too', 'shy', 'really', 'act', 'feelings', 'several', 'opportunities', 'Adding', 'bit', 'surreal', 'help', 'Diego', 'hallucination', 'sexy', 'TV', 'pitch-woman', 'hunky', 'male', 'assistant', 'who', 'periodically', 'act', 'feelings', 'enjoy', 'life', 'Featured', 'several', 'gay', 'international', 'film', 'festivals', 'film', 'Chile', 'engaging', 'tale', 'sexual', 'awakening', 'hands', 'capable', 'director', 'photographer', 'attractive', 'talented', 'young', 'cast', 'members', 'often', 'fine', 'line', 'bromance', 'romance', 'as', 'well', 'different', 'shades', 'sexual', 'orientation', 'Not', 'rated', 'likely', 'would', 'be', 'soft', 'R', 'sexual', 'content', 'explicit', 'sex', 'frontal', 'nudity', 'Spanish', 'English', 'subtitles', 'film', 'three', 'stars', 'five']",N/A

1549147,A1LX3GUBXMR3RS,B0089N7STG,FilmFoodie,"[2, 3]","This film looks to have been made with someone's lunch money. The production values are quite cheap and the translation in the subtitles is not good, but the point usually comes across. Homo-eroticism is used both subtly and obviously with a few misfires like the two leads showering together, camera shots of crotches that seemed inappropriate as more for the audience than the story and things like shots centered by casually exposed areas of a characters bodies, including one puzzling lingering shot of a boys shoe. The movie moves at a snails pace and the subtext wavered from over the top obvious (a clunky completely unnecessary element i took to be a TV phone sex model Lola who invades a boys imagination with her male counterpart Adonis to stand in as metaphors for the boy's sexual confusion). Then there's the unclear use of a young girl in a coma. Elements of these metaphorical subplots are clunky and some scenes of lesser quality than others disrupt the momentum. That all said, I found lovely bits of the film poetic but quite stark and real world. There are several well rendered shots and scenes that manage to overcome the on the cheap sets and locations. The film uses linear storytelling in a mostly real world narrative with a fantasy element (Lola and Adonis)clumsily used for metaphor. Overall the artists are on to something here, and although it was a struggle to get through, I actually kind of liked it.",3,A Slow But Ultimately Decent Film,1378944000,"09 12, 2013",2013,1432,"['film', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'someone', 'lunch', 'money', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'quite', 'cheap', 'translation', 'subtitles', 'not', 'good', 'point', 'usually', 'Homo-eroticism', 'used', 'subtly', 'obviously', 'few', 'misfires', 'two', 'leads', 'showering', 'together', 'camera', 'shots', 'crotches', 'seemed', 'inappropriate', 'more', 'audience', 'story', 'things', 'shots', 'centered', 'casually', 'exposed', 'areas', 'characters', 'bodies', 'including', 'one', 'puzzling', 'lingering', 'shot', 'boys', 'shoe', 'movie', 'snails', 'pace', 'subtext', 'wavered', 'top', 'obvious', 'clunky', 'completely', 'unnecessary', 'element', 'i', 'took', 'be', 'TV', 'phone', 'sex', 'model', 'Lola', 'who', 'boys', 'imagination', 'male', 'counterpart', 'Adonis', 'stand', 'metaphors', 'boy', 'sexual', 'confusion', 'Then', 'unclear', 'use', 'young', 'girl', 'coma', 'Elements', 'metaphorical', 'subplots', 'are', 'clunky', 'scenes', 'lesser', 'quality', 'others', 'disrupt', 'momentum', 'said', 'found', 'lovely', 'bits', 'film', 'poetic', 'quite', 'stark', 'real', 'world', 'are', 'several', 'well', 'rendered', 'shots', 'scenes', 'manage', 'overcome', 'cheap', 'sets', 'locations', 'film', 'linear', 'storytelling', 'mostly', 'real', 'world', 'narrative', 'fantasy', 'element', 'Lola', 'Adonis', 'clumsily', 'used', 'metaphor', 'artists', 'are', 'something', 'here', 'was', 'struggle', 'get', 'actually', 'kind', 'liked']",N/A

Running Time: One hour, 43 mins.Directed, Produced, written, edited and casted by Edwin Oyarce.Diego (Benjamin Prati) is a young photographer. One day, he meets Sebastian (Aquiles Poblete) again, whom he knew in his childhood. He was picking up some garbage and staying at his father's old house for the summer. For Sebastian and Diego, it is like old times again. They lay on the floor and talk like they use to. Sebastian reveals he lives with his mother in Antofagasta.Diego invites him to his mother's house for a vacation. There, they drink and sleep and go places to spend time alone with each other. Diego takes photos of Sebastian. But when Sebastian falls asleep, Diego looks at him and touches him. He doesn't wake up. Another time, they are so tired, they sleep together and when Sebastian moves his arm across Diego, he likes it.As Sebastian confides something personal to Diego, Diego just acts straight and doesn't want to reveal anything about himself. He can't open himself up to him. We find out why. But is it too late?Also in the cast: Beba Koenig-Robert, Matilde Plaza, Eyal Meyer, Gabriela Salazar, Paula Bravo.Filmed in Santiago, Chile.Language in Spanish. Subtitles in English (yellow).Well filmed movie from Chile, but I became unhappy with the story by Diego's anger with Sebastian and then bringing in the character of Gabriela. Once again, they make a movie with an unsatisfactory ending. Big mistake the director made by not letting us know what was written in the letter. Just once I would like a gay movie with a happy ending. Only a part 2 could make me feel better.Good acting from Aquiles Poblete.",3,He should have opened up to him.,1389312000,"01 10, 2014",2014,1692,"['Otra', 'Pelicula', 'de', 'amor', '2011', '/', 'Story', 'LoveNot', 'rated', 'Running', 'Time', 'One', 'hour', '43', 'mins.Directed', 'Produced', 'written', 'edited', 'casted', 'Edwin', 'Oyarce.Diego', 'Benjamin', 'Prati', 'young', 'photographer', 'One', 'day', 'Sebastian', 'Aquiles', 'Poblete', 'again', 'whom', 'knew', 'childhood', 'was', 'picking', 'up', 'garbage', 'staying', 'father', 'old', 'house', 'summer', 'Sebastian', 'Diego', 'old', 'times', 'again', 'lay', 'floor', 'talk', 'use', 'Sebastian', 'reveals', 'mother', 'Antofagasta.Diego', 'mother', 'house', 'vacation', 'drink', 'sleep', 'go', 'places', 'spend', 'time', 'alone', 'other', 'Diego', 'photos', 'Sebastian', 'when', 'Sebastian', 'asleep', 'Diego', ""n't"", 'wake', 'up', 'time', 'are', 'so', 'tired', 'sleep', 'together', 'when', 'Sebastian', 'arm', 'Diego', 'it.As', 'Sebastian', 'confides', 'something', 'personal', 'Diego', 'Diego', 'just', 'straight', ""n't"", 'want', 'reveal', 'anything', 'ca', ""n't"", 'open', 'up', 'find', 'out', 'why', 'too', 'late', 'Also', 'cast', 'Beba', 'Koenig-Robert', 'Matilde', 'Plaza', 'Eyal', 'Meyer', 'Gabriela', 'Salazar', 'Paula', 'Bravo.Filmed', 'Santiago', 'Chile.Language', 'Spanish', 'Subtitles', 'English', 'yellow', '.Well', 'filmed', 'movie', 'Chile', 'became', 'unhappy', 'story', 'Diego', 'anger', 'Sebastian', 'then', 'bringing', 'character', 'Gabriela', 'Once', 'again', 'make', 'movie', 'unsatisfactory', 'ending', 'Big', 'mistake', 'director', 'made', 'not', 'letting', 'know', 'what', 'was', 'written', 'letter', 'Just', 'once', 'would', 'like', 'gay', 'movie', 'happy', 'ending', 'Only', 'part', '2', 'could', 'make', 'feel', 'better.Good', 'acting', 'Aquiles', 'Poblete']",N/A

As such, the actors are good and appealing, but the story is slow and plodding.  It might have made a better short film.  Added to the movie, however, are a couple oddities:  the title and the fantasy element.  The basic story is a light-hearted drama, but the film title, in English, is ""Another Love Movie.""  In English, this sounds like it would be a silly film, which it is not.  At a few points, a fantasy element is introduced into the story, which is rather silly and out of sync with the rest of the film.  Why was it used?  Who knows.
