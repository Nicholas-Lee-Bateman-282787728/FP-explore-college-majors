Even though I am from a city environment, I spent my summers in a small rural farm visiting my grandparents. These actors did an amazing job of re-creating this type of town. Bravo!

1259503,A86HO5O1JIUAV,B002BEXG68,missy,"[1, 1]",Farrah was excellent so was the plot of the movie you will enjoy the story she make you feel all that is going on.  She is good with the saving the family farm from being sold she plays a range of being a running wild woman to being a settled down home town little woman set on the goal of being a success at farming with pigs that seem to something you would never guess she could do.  really well acted.  cast was picked good for their roles.  You really hate her sister.
