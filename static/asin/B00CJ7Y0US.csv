The tale of two people who meet by chance in a park one rainy day is filled with Shinkai's gorgeous skies, thoughtful attention to minor details and an appropriate music score. At about 45 minutes this movie does what it's supposed to do without a lot of filler or unnecessary scenes.I wanted to give this film 5 stars but I did feel that this film explored themes already done in Shinkai's earlier film ""5cm per second"". I don't want to spoil it for anyone but there were similarities to me between both films conclusions. Still, this was a great film and had its own story, characters and issues to resolve by film's conclusion.I recommend this film highly.

1648481,APLIP1V0ARWO0,B00CJ7Y0US,Brandon,"[7, 8]","I'm giving this movie a 5 star review because it's one of the most beautiful things I have ever seen in animation.  Blu-ray quality really comes through on this one; it looks like Shinkai literally painted it on my tv-screen.  If you're looking for a really good story this movie probably won't work for you (watch From Up On Poppy Hill or 5cm Per Sec.)  Despite that I believe it has a decent story with a very real and convincing issue, but the art is what I bought this movie for.  I can even watch it without the sound, it makes a great background movie.  It may be a little pricey for the length of the film and depth of the story but I feel like i got my moneys worth!",5,This movie is Art.,1381104000,"10 7, 2013",2013,674,"[""'m"", 'giving', 'movie', '5', 'star', 'review', 'one', 'most', 'beautiful', 'things', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'animation', 'Blu-ray', 'quality', 'really', 'through', 'one', 'Shinkai', 'literally', 'painted', 'tv-screen', ""'re"", 'looking', 'really', 'good', 'story', 'movie', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'work', 'watch', 'From', 'Up', 'Poppy', 'Hill', '5cm', 'Per', 'Sec', 'believe', 'decent', 'story', 'very', 'real', 'convincing', 'issue', 'art', 'what', 'bought', 'movie', 'can', 'even', 'watch', 'sound', 'great', 'background', 'movie', 'may', 'be', 'little', 'pricey', 'length', 'film', 'depth', 'story', 'feel', 'i', 'got', 'moneys', 'worth']",Garden of Words
1648482,A2V12SVGIKWVFP,B00CJ7Y0US,Brendan Riley,"[1, 1]","This is absolutely  stunning. I got this just because the animation looked so good, so realistic in that classic anime style. The backgrounds were lush and detailed, and the rain! When it was raining, which was a lot for a bit of the show, it looked so good and the raindrops landing on stoic water was PERFECT. The voice acting also needs an admirable nod (the English that is, I didn't watch it in Japanese). I had no idea what this was about, again, emphasizing the appeal of the animation, but I was pleasantly surprised.A heartwarming tale (cliche phrase, I know) about unconventional love that must be prolonged until a more appropriate time, a story of redemption through love, and about finding the courage to believe in oneself and chase one's dreams. This really is not just a visually beautiful masterpiece, despite it's short length, it also has a strong foundation by way of the story to give structure for the art. This made me want to get 5 Centimeters Per Second (by the same director), but that is probably not going to happen (price and availability both suck).

1648484,A30JPZ9TZ7I61U,B00CJ7Y0US,"Christopher Barrett ""Evil Corgi""","[0, 0]","Makoto Shinkai is a very interesting director/creator. His previous films have all been favorites of mine, and pretty much anyone I've convinced to sit and watch with me. The Place Promised in Our Early Days seems to be out of print and costs an arm and a leg on most sales sites. So instead of doing the whole rental thing (because eventually folks 'keep' the rented copies - then I'm out of luck!), I decided to start purchasing his films.In his interesting and alternating fashion, this story, much like 5 Centimeters Per Second is in a more realistic and modern setting. I won't get into too many details, but it mainly involves a student and a young woman who meet by chance in a park based on Shinjuku Gyoen in Tokyo. (I love the warning at the end of the film: alcohol and tobacco are NOT allowed to be consumed in Shinjuku Gyoen park! Look for it in the credits!) Both seem to have their own personal issues, but instead of venting and whining, they quietly continue their respective introversion. One of the first lines in the film is a form of haiku (a tanka) that the young woman speaks to the young man. This tanka sets the tone for the remainder of the film.Like 5 Cm, this is a slow film with sparse dialogue. Instead of filling gaps with words, Shinkai decides to use sound effects and beautiful imagery to convey his message. He has used a lot of very interesting themes and metaphors in this film. One will notice the use of water quite often. Also, much of the film is animated with windows or other clear objects separating the viewer and the character or the character and the scenery.Though this is a shorter film from Shinkai, it is still a great film nonetheless. It is a beautiful piece of animated art. The combination of hand drawn art, painted backdrops, and computer enhanced and animated settings is splendid. I am a huge fan of his and this film is a worthy addition to his creations. Buy it now before it goes out of print and the price jumps to $70+!Highly recommended!",5,"Subtle, heartfelt and touching.",1378684800,"09 9, 2013",2013,2001,"['Makoto', 'Shinkai', 'very', 'interesting', 'director/creator', 'previous', 'films', 'have', 'been', 'favorites', 'mine', 'pretty', 'much', 'anyone', ""'ve"", 'convinced', 'sit', 'watch', 'Place', 'Promised', 'Early', 'Days', 'be', 'print', 'arm', 'leg', 'most', 'sales', 'sites', 'So', 'instead', 'doing', 'whole', 'rental', 'thing', 'eventually', 'folks', ""'keep"", 'rented', 'copies', 'then', ""'m"", 'luck', 'decided', 'start', 'purchasing', 'films.In', 'interesting', 'alternating', 'fashion', 'story', 'much', '5', 'Centimeters', 'Per', 'Second', 'more', 'realistic', 'modern', 'setting', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'too', 'many', 'details', 'mainly', 'student', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'chance', 'park', 'based', 'Shinjuku', 'Gyoen', 'Tokyo', 'love', 'warning', 'end', 'film', 'alcohol', 'tobacco', 'are', 'NOT', 'allowed', 'be', 'consumed', 'Shinjuku', 'Gyoen', 'park', 'Look', 'credits', 'seem', 'have', 'own', 'personal', 'issues', 'instead', 'venting', 'whining', 'quietly', 'continue', 'respective', 'introversion', 'One', 'first', 'lines', 'film', 'form', 'haiku', 'tanka', 'young', 'woman', 'young', 'man', 'tanka', 'tone', 'remainder', 'film.Like', '5', 'Cm', 'slow', 'film', 'sparse', 'dialogue', 'Instead', 'filling', 'gaps', 'words', 'Shinkai', 'use', 'sound', 'effects', 'beautiful', 'imagery', 'convey', 'message', 'used', 'lot', 'very', 'interesting', 'themes', 'metaphors', 'film', 'One', 'will', 'notice', 'use', 'water', 'quite', 'often', 'Also', 'much', 'film', 'animated', 'windows', 'other', 'clear', 'objects', 'separating', 'viewer', 'character', 'character', 'scenery.Though', 'shorter', 'film', 'Shinkai', 'still', 'great', 'film', 'nonetheless', 'beautiful', 'piece', 'animated', 'art', 'combination', 'hand', 'drawn', 'art', 'painted', 'backdrops', 'computer', 'enhanced', 'animated', 'settings', 'splendid', 'am', 'huge', 'fan', 'film', 'worthy', 'addition', 'creations', 'Buy', 'now', 'print', 'price', 'jumps', '70+', 'Highly', 'recommended']",Garden of Words

As emotional and dramatic as it is, I could have easily watched it - at its existing caliber - for several hours. I may have run out of tears, but I would have done it.The match between this 15 year old boy (Akizuki) and a woman he meets in the park (but only when it's raining) grows from barely a nod and a random tanka as she walks away from their first meeting, into what can only be described as something quite possibly more powerful than love. If there is such a thing. Yukino's need for someone to listen, to understand and accept her isn't something I saw as ""tragic"" per se...more so something that she simply hadn't found yet even when she thought she had. Through a quick series of ""bad luck actions / reactions"" Yukino is thrown under the proverbial bus by some of her students and can't remain in the school where she is a teacher.In an ironic spin, the one person who DOES understand her - and cares for her even before he realizes it himself - is a student from her school...though neither has ever seen the other at school. He is a self-trained cobbler, though he admits not a good one. He finally decides he wants to make shoes FOR HER; but shoes that will make her *want* to walk in them. And while the events aren't necessarily rushed in the 45 minutes of run time, we see the events unfold where she allows him to do just that, including being a foot model as they sit in ""their garden"".Because I hate to say more than I have already, I will wrap it with: watching the ending is worth EVERY, SINGLE MOMENT spent to reach it. And by this point I was a blubbering mess! The emotions that riddled the screen and story, by and within all, but especially the final scenes simply MUST have been difficult to perform...because as a simple viewer it's difficult to watch and not want to drag Yukino into your arms.These are two very powerful characters, brought to life in the most superb way and who create once of the most beautiful stories I have ever watched - whether anime or mainstream.

But after hearing all the stuff about being the next Miyazaki, it's no wonder he wanted to take on a more food for the masses approach and bang out something a lot of  people would want to watch.  He even said himself he wanted a style, art style as well similar to what people expect of a Ghibli film.  But I loved the almost home-made feel I get when I look at some of those wonderful backgrounds in 5 cm.  It's like the difference between eating via a drive through, fast food joint or sitting down for a home cooked meal.  I'll take the homemade one every time.I truly hope that Shinkai is not going to spend even an ounce of his time/effort trying to be the next Miyazaki.  But that years down the road people may call the next talented up & coming Anime creator &#34;the next  Shinkai&#34;...  that's what I'd like to see.  And seeing him return to a piece that gives you many of the same things you got (and loved) out of 5cm... gives me hope that he will be true to himself.This is where he shines.  Slice of life animes with themes (often) centered around loving & losing, and moving on... as time, distance, and circumstances beyond your control tear you apart.  And his beautiful background art... he really puts in the extra hours to make sure that not 1 (even seemingly minor) detail is overlooked.If he bangs out a few more films like this he'll be at top of my list.  5cm is already in my top 5.  Also I like that you don't feel all films have to be 1:30+, to even 2 hours.  1 is plenty.  And also I like the chapters thing you did with 5 cm.

This is a story about a love that blossoms between a mature 15 year old and a 27 year old who admits she's in arrested development since age 15. It is a relationship that could be considered controversial, due to the adult/minor nature of it.27 year old Yukari doesn't have a lot going on in her life, romantically, hence when she chances to meet 15 year old Takao at Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden, time and again, and always on rainy days, the combination of chemistry, coupled with her arrested emotional development, leads to an impractical relationship with a much younger person.As the story progresses, it emerges that she is a teacher at the same school which he attends. At some point, rumors fly and she loses her job as a result. There isn't a lot positive that happens here, on the surface.While this is all happening, we're treated to absolutely stunning scenery and animation that is breathtaking. An incoming thunderstorm, with it's sudden gust of wind, followed by the first few large raindrops, rapidly escalating into a deluge, as our subjects seek shelter under a gazebo, is astonishingly portrayed with perfect sound and visuals. The viewer almost FEELS the rain and the moisture in the air, it's that realistic. The garden is a nice setting for a romantic story, and we bounce back and forth between apartment living, riding the transit system and this park several times as the story unfolds. It's all amazingly real.I would rate it 5 stars if the story were as good as the animation. It's not a bad story. It's somewhat pathetic because it portrays a dysfunctional relationship. Like most of Shinkai's films, Garden of Words is less than satisfyingly happy. But there may be a tiny hint of hope, if they can hang on a few years until Takao graduates and finds a stable career.If you appreciate fine art in motion, then this film deserves a place in your collection.

Colombo,"[0, 0]","Anyone who is seriously interested in the art and craft of modern animation should put this short movie at the top of his or hers ""Must Watch"" list.As an exercise in depicting the world around us, it is one the best animated films in the realistic style I have ever seen.The portrait of nature and the urban landscape is remarkable in its beauty and richness of detail.The blu-ray version includes an hour-long interview with the director and the two Japanese voice artists that impersonate the main characters.The story has been stripped down to the barest of plots: it has essentially two characters -- and there is hardly any conversation between them. (In fact, the narration felt a little too thin to me, that's why four stars.) They are, for most of the 46 minutes of the film, an enigma to each other, and to the audience. We know more about one of them because the ""camera"" follows him for much of the time, so we learn that he is a rather mature and serious 15-year old in middle school, who thinks he has found an uncommon vocation (making beautiful shoes) that might take him somewhere else, beyond the confines of his unremarkable life, and is keen to find out if he is up to it. The other one is a 27-year old woman going through a rough patch. They meet repeatedly, at first by chance, at a gazebo in a park in central Tokyo during rainy days (he uses rain as an excuse to cut classes).

It's about having someone there for you that you could connect with, in a emotion and real level, but not in a romantic way. I love how the rain represents their feelings and it also represents love, because love will always be there, even when you push it away. The english dub is very well done, it does have a couple of parts where the lipsync was a little off, but nothing bad, nothing that would distract you from the film. The music is amazing, and it fit's the mood of the film perfectly. So, like I said before, I don't think this film is about love in a romantic way, but love in the sense of companionship.
