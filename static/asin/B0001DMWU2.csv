801550,A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z,B0001DMWU2,Annie Van Auken,"[2, 2]","Considering the amount of talent involved on both sides of the camera, why RKO's BEHAVE YOURSELF (1951) fails as entertainment is most baffling. Produced by Norman Krasna and Jerry Wald, with photography by James Wong Howe, a theme song written by Buddy Ebsen and a cast that includes at least eight well-known actors, none of these can save this movie from itself.Perhaps the script is poorly crafted. There's clearly zero chemistry between the leads and Mr. Granger struggles in a ""frustrated by circumstances"" role best suited to Cary Grant. One watches this, recognizes all the familiar faces, and wants to savor the movie, get into what should be a delicious story, but it's nearly impossible. The ultimate answer for this flop may be found in that late '50s stageplayGYPSY, when brassy Rose, mother to Gypsy Rose Lee declares with utmost confidence: ""Ya either got it, or ya ain't.""That's it! The missing ingredient, that secret of success which eluded all involved with BEHAVE YOURSELF... is confidence. For all its fluster, bluster and busy-ness, an undercurrent of well-hidden timidity doomed this picture to an oblivion from which it has since been needlessly rescued by various public domain and budget brand home video manufacturers.If you like the people in this curio by all means spend the 80 minutes to see it, there's surely worse out there. But when it's over and if you too feel something's lacking here, please remember that when it comes to motion pictures, ""pizazz,"" ""oomph"" and ""it"" have, like lightning bolts, always been impossible to control, predict or bottle. So, has BEHAVE YOURSELF ""got it""? Frankly... it ain't.Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 imdb viewer poll rating.(5.9) Behave Yourself (1951) - Farley Granger/Shelley Winters/Bill Demarest/Margalo Gillmore/Lon Chaney Jr./Hans Conried/Elisha Cook Jr./Allen Jenkins/Sheldon Leonard/Marvin Kaplan",2,"Has this film ""got it""?",1275436800,"06 2, 2010",2010,1896,"['Considering', 'amount', 'talent', 'involved', 'sides', 'camera', 'why', 'RKO', 'BEHAVE', 'YOURSELF', '1951', 'entertainment', 'most', 'baffling', 'Produced', 'Norman', 'Krasna', 'Jerry', 'Wald', 'photography', 'James', 'Wong', 'Howe', 'theme', 'song', 'written', 'Buddy', 'Ebsen', 'cast', 'least', 'eight', 'well-known', 'actors', 'none', 'can', 'save', 'movie', 'script', 'poorly', 'crafted', 'clearly', 'zero', 'chemistry', 'leads', 'Mr.', 'Granger', 'frustrated', 'circumstances', 'role', 'best', 'suited', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'One', 'familiar', 'savor', 'movie', 'get', 'what', 'should', 'be', 'delicious', 'story', 'nearly', 'impossible', 'ultimate', 'answer', 'flop', 'may', 'be', 'found', 'late', ""'50s"", 'stageplayGYPSY', 'when', 'brassy', 'Rose', 'mother', 'Gypsy', 'Rose', 'Lee', 'utmost', 'confidence', 'got', 'ai', ""n't"", 'missing', 'ingredient', 'secret', 'success', 'eluded', 'involved', 'BEHAVE', 'YOURSELF', 'confidence', 'fluster', 'bluster', 'busy-ness', 'undercurrent', 'well-hidden', 'timidity', 'doomed', 'picture', 'oblivion', 'been', 'needlessly', 'rescued', 'various', 'public', 'domain', 'budget', 'brand', 'home', 'video', 'manufacturers.If', 'people', 'curio', 'means', 'spend', '80', 'minutes', 'see', 'surely', 'worse', 'out', 'there', 'when', 'too', 'feel', 'something', 'lacking', 'here', 'please', 'remember', 'when', 'motion', 'pictures', 'pizazz', 'oomph', 'have', 'lightning', 'bolts', 'always', 'been', 'impossible', 'control', 'predict', 'bottle', 'So', 'BEHAVE', 'YOURSELF', 'got', 'Frankly', ""ain't.Parenthetical"", 'number', 'preceding', 'title', '1', '10', 'imdb', 'viewer', 'poll', 'rating', '5.9', 'Behave', 'Yourself', '1951', 'Farley', 'Granger/Shelley', 'Winters/Bill', 'Demarest/Margalo', 'Gillmore/Lon', 'Chaney', 'Jr./Hans', 'Conried/Elisha', 'Cook', 'Jr./Allen', 'Jenkins/Sheldon', 'Leonard/Marvin', 'Kaplan']",N/A

801555,A1C58YXM2A30CY,B0001DMWU2,"Scotman's Film & Book Reviews ""Film & Book Re...","[0, 1]","Behave Yourself!Not sure why the film is titled the way it was.  I did want to watch it as I have not seen an early Shelly Winters film.  I could only imagine an older, larger Shelly from the film ""Poseidon Adventure.""The film is a situation comedy of sorts.  The early 50s version of situation comedy includes lots of misunderstandings, a mother-in-law doing Dianetics classes in the evenings, and an innocent man who (a) forgot his wife's anniversary; (b) had a run-in with a dog who is trained in finding drop-off points for smugglers and (c) is always at the scene of a murder or three!Sorry but the overacting was just too much.  The comedy was not that funny to the modern viewer and the cops not really understanding what was going on as the stumbled through the scenes and the equally dumb gangsters with pratfalls and further misunderstandings - well!Stars:  Fun to see William Demerist in something other than his ""My Three Sons"" TV series (from the Sixties).  And Lon Chaney Jr. as a heavy was a sight to see.Shelly Winters acted as a clueless woman who faints more than she babbles on about her husband.  The mother-in-law was a gem, how she accuses her son-in-law of murder and says ""it figures"" several times throughout the film.Unless you're a big Shelly Winters fan, probably not the style for you.  Lucille Ball played this theme so much better.DVD:  My DVD was from Alpha Video and did not have any features other than scene selections.Cast & Crew:Director:George BeckWriters:George Beck (screenplay), George Beck (story)Stars:Farley Granger, Shelley Winters and William Demarest",3,For The Dogs -- Too Zany for Me!,1333411200,"04 3, 2012",2012,1597,"['Behave', 'Not', 'sure', 'why', 'film', 'titled', 'way', 'was', 'did', 'want', 'watch', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'early', 'Shelly', 'Winters', 'film', 'could', 'only', 'imagine', 'older', 'larger', 'Shelly', 'film', 'Poseidon', 'Adventure', 'film', 'situation', 'comedy', 'sorts', 'early', '50s', 'version', 'situation', 'comedy', 'lots', 'misunderstandings', 'mother-in-law', 'doing', 'Dianetics', 'classes', 'evenings', 'innocent', 'man', 'who', 'forgot', 'wife', 'anniversary', 'b', 'had', 'run-in', 'dog', 'who', 'trained', 'finding', 'drop-off', 'points', 'smugglers', 'c', 'always', 'scene', 'murder', 'three', 'Sorry', 'overacting', 'was', 'just', 'too', 'much', 'comedy', 'was', 'not', 'funny', 'modern', 'viewer', 'cops', 'not', 'really', 'understanding', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'stumbled', 'scenes', 'equally', 'dumb', 'gangsters', 'pratfalls', 'further', 'misunderstandings', 'well', 'Stars', 'Fun', 'see', 'William', 'Demerist', 'something', 'other', 'Three', 'Sons', 'TV', 'series', 'Sixties', 'Lon', 'Chaney', 'Jr.', 'heavy', 'was', 'sight', 'see.Shelly', 'Winters', 'acted', 'clueless', 'woman', 'who', 'more', 'husband', 'mother-in-law', 'was', 'gem', 'how', 'son-in-law', 'murder', 'several', 'times', 'film.Unless', ""'re"", 'big', 'Shelly', 'Winters', 'fan', 'probably', 'not', 'style', 'Lucille', 'Ball', 'played', 'theme', 'so', 'much', 'better.DVD', 'DVD', 'was', 'Alpha', 'Video', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'features', 'other', 'scene', 'selections.Cast', 'Crew', 'Director', 'George', 'BeckWriters', 'George', 'Beck', 'screenplay', 'George', 'Beck', 'story', 'Farley', 'Granger', 'Shelley', 'Winters', 'William', 'Demarest']",N/A
