80873,A3QUTP3HTNI621,0788812483,A. Cadwallender,"[5, 8]","Enough has been said elsewhere about what a charming, heart-rending tale this is, so, just to be different, I would like to draw your attention to the scene where the tenement children turn up at court with seven shillings in pennies, half-pennies and farthings to pay Bobby's licence fee and thus save his life.The scene is set in 1867, but when the coins are poured out on the table in court, you will see that several of the pennies bear the old, veiled head of Queen Victoria which did not appear until 1893.  Furthermore, if you freeze that scene, and play it frame by frame, you will notice miscellaneous coins from the reigns of George V and George VI, whose reigns did not begin until 1910 and 1936 respectively.Admittedly it is highly unlikely that these latter coins would have been noticed by anybody, but the old, veiled head of Queen Victoria on some of the pennies is glaringly obvious.  In 1961, when this film was made, coins of all monarchs, from Victoria onwards, were still in general circulation in varying quantities.Greyfriars Bobby is still a delightful film, but watching out for the coins will perhaps add a little bit of extra interest.",4,"Watch Out For The Pennies, Half-Pennies, And Farthings.",1204156800,"02 28, 2008",2008,1162,"['Enough', 'been', 'said', 'elsewhere', 'what', 'charming', 'heart-rending', 'tale', 'so', 'just', 'be', 'different', 'would', 'like', 'draw', 'attention', 'scene', 'where', 'tenement', 'children', 'turn', 'up', 'court', 'seven', 'shillings', 'pennies', 'half-pennies', 'farthings', 'pay', 'Bobby', 'licence', 'fee', 'thus', 'save', 'life.The', 'scene', 'set', '1867', 'when', 'coins', 'are', 'poured', 'out', 'table', 'court', 'will', 'see', 'several', 'pennies', 'bear', 'old', 'veiled', 'head', 'Queen', 'Victoria', 'did', 'not', 'appear', '1893', 'Furthermore', 'freeze', 'scene', 'play', 'frame', 'frame', 'will', 'notice', 'miscellaneous', 'coins', 'reigns', 'George', 'V', 'George', 'VI', 'reigns', 'did', 'not', 'begin', '1910', '1936', 'respectively.Admittedly', 'highly', 'unlikely', 'latter', 'coins', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'noticed', 'anybody', 'old', 'veiled', 'head', 'Queen', 'Victoria', 'pennies', 'glaringly', 'obvious', '1961', 'when', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'coins', 'monarchs', 'Victoria', 'onwards', 'were', 'still', 'general', 'circulation', 'varying', 'quantities.Greyfriars', 'Bobby', 'still', 'delightful', 'film', 'watching', 'out', 'coins', 'will', 'perhaps', 'add', 'little', 'bit', 'extra', 'interest']",N/A

The tale is true and from the events that are recorded from the mid 1800s in Edinburgh, Scotland. You will be richly blessed by seeing this dramatic tale of one dog, and how he came to be loved by an entire town, for decades and decades.Disney has taken the account of Bobby, the dog to become known as ""Greyfriars Bobby"", from the book by the same name written by Eleanor Atkinson, an Indiana author for youth. The DVD Disney film stick closely to the author's account which is known to be a bit of an embellishment to the actual account, making it a bit more dramatic for children. It is a superb story, and a beautiful and exciting film created in the always high quality of any Disney production.  This is a true FAMILY FILM, appreciated by all ages--4 to 104 years.Sets are typical Disney delights, historically accurate, beautifully presented, and worthy of the ""CLASSIC"" labeling from all aspects of the production.Let yourself slip back into the 1850's and 1860's of old Edinburgh and experience Greyfriars Bobby and his story firsthand.Also, pick up the book, Greyfriars Bobby, by Eleanor Atkinson, and gift it to a dog lover or a child.

Or at least this cat-guy thinks so.I came across this tale while reading about The Three Lives of Thomasina, a film with many of the same actors, a similar setting and theme, but much more heart. This story depends on the sentimental, and pushes the tear-jerker buttons more overtly and enthusiastically. In Thomasina, we watch characters grow and evolve, learning and changing in the process. Here we see crotchety old men melted by a cute and loyal little doggie. Now this is not to say that button-pushing was unsuccessful; no, it indeed worked splendidly. My eyes were quite moist by the end. But while pleasant, this film is just slighter and less powerful.

Unfortunately, the master of the farm can no longer afford to keep Old Jock on.  Old Jock heads to Edinburgh to an uncertain future, leaving his dog Bobby behind to be the dog of his master's daughter.  Bobby has other ideas and follows Old Jock off to Edinburgh.  To use a clich&eacute;, the rest is history.We know that Old Jock is sick at the beginning of the movie.  He has a persistent cough that must be an indication of something bad.  After his arrival in Edinburgh he has the good fortune to meet with Mr. Traill, who owns a tavern.  Old Jock also has the good fortune to encounter Bobby, who has been looking for him everywhere.  Mr. Traill tries to get a doctor to see to Old Jock, but Old Jock associates doctors and infirmaries with dying, so he disappears into the rain before the doctor arrives.  Old Jock eventually finds a room at a cheap inn with a leaking roof and a screechy old woman as the proprietress.  Old Jock plays with Bobby one last time before falling into a sleep from which he will never arise.A problem arises immediately.  Where is Old Jock's Skye Terrier Bobby to live?  Bobby knows only one master, Old Jock, and he sleeps now in Greyfriars Kirkyard (which means a church yard).  There is trouble for Bobby to stay in the Kirkyard.  Mr. Brown, the caretaker of Greyfriars Kirkyard, will not permit a dog to stay in the Kirkyard.  What no one has reckoned with is the power of Bobby's pure love and the effect it has on everyone who meets him.""Greyfriars Bobby"" is a marvelous Disney film that captures all the things we love most about animals and dogs in particular.  Some animals just seem to capture our hearts with their single-minded devotion, and certainly everyone, including the Provost of Edinburgh and the population of Edinburgh, felt Bobby's love.  I certainly got a warm feeling as I watched this movie.  I am glad that this movie is part of my collection and I look forward to watching it again.This movie contains quite a few well-known actors.  Donald Crisp played Mr. Brown.  Crisp also appeared in ""Spencer's Mountain,"" ""Pollyanna,"" ""A Dog of Flanders"" (1960), ""National Velvet"" and many more.  Laurence Naismith played Mr. Traill.  Naismith made a number of television appearances in the 1960's and 1970's.  He also appeared in the James Bond movie ""Diamonds Are Forever,"" ""Sink the Bismarck,"" ""Boy on a Dolphin,"" and dozens of other films.  Alex MacKenzie played Old Jock (whose real name was John Gray).  Mackenzie has a relatively short career, but he appeared in two other Disney films in the early 1960's: ""Kidnapped"" and ""The Three Lives of Thomasina.""  Many of the other actors also had long and successful acting careers, including Duncan McRae, Gordon Jackson, Freda Jackson, Joyce Carey, Jameson Clark, and Bruce Seton.Historical Note:  There is a statue to Bobby located at the corner of King George IV Bridge and Candlemaker's Row.  Bobby was a real dog who watched over his master's grave for fourteen years after his death.  The movie did take a number of liberties with Bobby's story, but those liberties did a nice job of capturing the feeling of Bobby's loyalty and love.""Greyfriars Bobby"" captures all the magic that Walt Disney could put into a film inspired by a true story.

Cinematography by Paul Beeson. Produced by Walt Disney.Starring Laurence Naismith, Freda Jackson and Donald Crisp.The true story, set in 1865 Edinborough, of a cute terrier named Bobby who, when his master dies, sleeps every night at the grave.  In the daytime, he spreads happiness and joy among lonely bachelors, a childless couple and the neighborhood's poor children.  However when the bad people want to take Bobby away because he does not have a license, a trial ensues that will prove to be one of the greatest in the history of Western jurisprudence.

It occurs that there is a scene in the Karlolf/lugosi film THE BODY SNATCHER that is a nasty bad joke based on the story of Bobby. Naismith was also in the excellent JASON AND THE ARGONAUTS(which Chaffey also directed) and SCROOGE. Jackson in BRIDES OF DRACULA and Crisp...nearly the end of a long career appeared in everything from Griffith silent classics such as BROKEN BLOSSOMS to myriad highly regarded John Ford pictures and the horror classic THE UNINVITED.
