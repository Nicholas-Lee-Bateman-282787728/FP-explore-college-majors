877901,A3VZVYWCTGIEV0,B000784WS6,"Bill Your 'Free Form FM Print DJ ""bill nicholas""","[2, 3]","Conventional wisdom about the Manson family: Charlie the madman took a bunch of innocent young drifters in 1969 and fed them mountins ofL S D. He was able to convince them of the nobility of his plans, and the girls commited the Tate-Labianca murders on his orders that August.This has been the story line since LA District Atternoy Vincent Bolgiosi tried the case in 1970 and got convictions. And it made sense--Manson masterminded these killings but the girls carried them out. Bolgisoi needed to prove a conspirisy to convict Manson.The Manson Family, this film, has a different theroy. These girls were sadistic little wenches to begin with, and the sex and drugs and nonsence 60s rap Charlie fed them only fuled their sociopatic impules. Further, the August killings were not just spawned by hippie underbelly madness. Before Tate Labianca, Manson had killed a Black Panther in a money deal gone wrong, and the murders that summer were part of a scheme to throw authorites off the trail. According to the film, the family also gang raped the wife of the land owner where they had set up camp.Taken at face value, this changes the implications of the Tate-Labianca butchery. If the family can be seen more as a criminal enterprise then a mystified hippie cult, the real cruelity of their crimes can be viewed in a much starker light.But director Jim Van Beeber takes this a step further: the film also deals with the Manson acolytes who continued to follow him into the 90s. Here, these young killers in punk rock drag kill a TV reporter working on a documentry about Manson. This reporter summerizes the point of the film, early, saying 'It is all Charlie, Charlie, Charlie. What about the kids who put  the knives in the victims.""During these 90s scenes, there is virtually no dialouge between the memebrs of the Manson posee. Implied is that there is little thought put behind their worship of Manson  or their own crimes. Their criminality also seems to feed on freekoid sex, drugs, and out and out wierdness that contains no reason or subtance.Sixties or Nineties, the Manson Family documents the crimes in graphic, horrific fashion. This is probably the most violent film I have ever seen, and I do not go out of my way to avoid violent movies. But, the violence is not gratuitous- to Vanbeeber's credit,  he uses the gore of the Manson crimes to deflate the icon myth of Manson.This set also contains a bonus disc on why this film took almost 20 years to get made. The film making process is fascinating, and so are the stories of the actors--who often worked for free to make the film.",5,classic,1247875200,"07 18, 2009",2009,2597,"['Conventional', 'wisdom', 'Manson', 'family', 'Charlie', 'madman', 'took', 'bunch', 'innocent', 'young', 'drifters', '1969', 'fed', 'ofL', 'S', 'D.', 'was', 'able', 'convince', 'nobility', 'plans', 'girls', 'commited', 'Tate-Labianca', 'murders', 'orders', 'August.This', 'been', 'story', 'line', 'LA', 'District', 'Atternoy', 'Vincent', 'Bolgiosi', 'tried', 'case', '1970', 'got', 'convictions', 'made', 'sense', 'Manson', 'masterminded', 'killings', 'girls', 'carried', 'out', 'Bolgisoi', 'needed', 'prove', 'conspirisy', 'convict', 'Manson.The', 'Manson', 'Family', 'film', 'different', 'theroy', 'girls', 'were', 'sadistic', 'little', 'wenches', 'begin', 'sex', 'drugs', 'nonsence', '60s', 'rap', 'Charlie', 'fed', 'only', 'fuled', 'sociopatic', 'impules', 'Further', 'August', 'killings', 'were', 'not', 'just', 'spawned', 'hippie', 'underbelly', 'madness', 'Tate', 'Labianca', 'Manson', 'had', 'killed', 'Black', 'Panther', 'money', 'deal', 'gone', 'wrong', 'murders', 'summer', 'were', 'part', 'scheme', 'throw', 'authorites', 'trail', 'According', 'film', 'family', 'also', 'gang', 'raped', 'wife', 'land', 'owner', 'where', 'had', 'set', 'up', 'camp.Taken', 'face', 'value', 'implications', 'Tate-Labianca', 'butchery', 'family', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'more', 'criminal', 'enterprise', 'then', 'mystified', 'hippie', 'cult', 'real', 'cruelity', 'crimes', 'can', 'be', 'viewed', 'much', 'starker', 'director', 'Jim', 'Van', 'Beeber', 'step', 'further', 'film', 'also', 'Manson', 'acolytes', 'who', 'continued', 'follow', '90s', 'Here', 'young', 'killers', 'punk', 'rock', 'drag', 'kill', 'TV', 'reporter', 'working', 'documentry', 'Manson', 'reporter', 'point', 'film', 'early', 'saying', 'Charlie', 'Charlie', 'Charlie', 'What', 'kids', 'who', 'put', 'knives', 'victims', '90s', 'scenes', 'virtually', 'dialouge', 'memebrs', 'Manson', 'posee', 'Implied', 'little', 'thought', 'put', 'worship', 'Manson', 'own', 'crimes', 'criminality', 'also', 'feed', 'freekoid', 'sex', 'drugs', 'out', 'wierdness', 'reason', 'subtance.Sixties', 'Nineties', 'Manson', 'Family', 'documents', 'crimes', 'graphic', 'horrific', 'fashion', 'probably', 'most', 'violent', 'film', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'do', 'not', 'go', 'way', 'avoid', 'violent', 'movies', 'violence', 'not', 'gratuitous-', 'Vanbeeber', 'credit', 'gore', 'Manson', 'crimes', 'deflate', 'icon', 'myth', 'Manson.This', 'set', 'also', 'bonus', 'disc', 'why', 'film', 'took', 'almost', '20', 'years', 'get', 'made', 'film', 'making', 'process', 'fascinating', 'so', 'are', 'stories', 'actors', 'who', 'often', 'worked', 'free', 'make', 'film']",The Manson Family
877902,A2MUD2VY9HWFXQ,B000784WS6,Boggman!,"[4, 9]","For those out there not overly familiar with the story of Charles Manson, The Manson Family, The Tate & La Bianca murders, or the crazy drug induced summer of 69 at the Spahn ranch; this will no doubt be an entertaining film to watch.Plentifully filled with lots of sex, nudity, drugs and tons of blood; this film is an artistic representation of one of the most publicized murders and murderous ""family"" of the last 35 years.Done in art house style- ""The Manson Family"" is full of vivid colors and sets, lots of red blood, and lots of imagination. This is one of the most artistically presented horror movies that I have seen come out of the United States in quite some time.However, having said that, the film is also extremely disturbing for anyone with in depth knowledge of the Tate & La Bianca murders or anyone who has ever felt sympathy for these victims.This reviewer loves to indulge in the most disturbing of horror. However, just the fact that these were REAL murders, I find it almost insulting that they were recreated in such a fashion. To watch these people die in such vivid detail - with so much blood and with so much ""color""; was a little unsettling to say the least. I just couldn't help but feel sorry for anyone who might actually be connected to the victims if they were to ever have to suffer through this film.When it's gritty, grimy, bloody, shocking and disturbing, fictional horror is at its best.True life horror movies can be just as enthralling when left in the hands of a capable filmmaker who respects the victims, while at the same time presenting a honest portrait of murder and mayhem.Although ""The Manson Family"" is only based on a true story, and does not claim to be a fictional, nor documentary movie- it manages to weasel it's way out of both categories above.However, this is a true story that is so well documented, and still so prevalent in our media and our culture- that it holds a certain significance with many people (including myself, who's read ""Helter Skelter"" and ""The Family"" twice, in addition with seeing the countless other films made about it all).To see these shocking and real life murders played out in ""art house"" styl is really an injustice to the actual crimes, victims, and victims' families who are very much alive and well to this day.""The Manson Family"" is a good film, on the basis that you don't know too much about the actual Manson Family History. The more you know, the more respect you lose for Jim Van Bebber's vivid retelling of these murders, and of ""The Manson Family"" as a film.I also thought that including Charles Manson's music in the film was downright appalling.Nobody needs to hear that crap......",3,Mixed Feelings....,1117065600,"05 26, 2005",2005,2683,"['there', 'not', 'overly', 'familiar', 'story', 'Charles', 'Manson', 'Manson', 'Family', 'Tate', 'La', 'Bianca', 'murders', 'crazy', 'drug', 'induced', 'summer', '69', 'Spahn', 'ranch', 'will', 'doubt', 'be', 'entertaining', 'film', 'watch.Plentifully', 'filled', 'lots', 'sex', 'nudity', 'drugs', 'tons', 'blood', 'film', 'artistic', 'representation', 'one', 'most', 'publicized', 'murders', 'murderous', 'family', 'last', '35', 'years.Done', 'art', 'house', 'style-', 'Manson', 'Family', 'full', 'vivid', 'colors', 'sets', 'lots', 'red', 'blood', 'lots', 'imagination', 'one', 'most', 'artistically', 'presented', 'horror', 'movies', 'have', 'seen', 'come', 'United', 'States', 'quite', 'time.However', 'having', 'said', 'film', 'also', 'extremely', 'disturbing', 'anyone', 'depth', 'knowledge', 'Tate', 'La', 'Bianca', 'murders', 'anyone', 'who', 'ever', 'felt', 'sympathy', 'victims.This', 'reviewer', 'loves', 'indulge', 'most', 'disturbing', 'horror', 'However', 'just', 'fact', 'were', 'REAL', 'murders', 'find', 'almost', 'insulting', 'were', 'recreated', 'such', 'fashion', 'watch', 'people', 'die', 'such', 'vivid', 'detail', 'so', 'much', 'blood', 'so', 'much', 'color', 'was', 'little', 'unsettling', 'say', 'least', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'sorry', 'anyone', 'who', 'might', 'actually', 'be', 'connected', 'victims', 'were', 'ever', 'have', 'suffer', 'film.When', 'gritty', 'grimy', 'bloody', 'shocking', 'disturbing', 'fictional', 'horror', 'best.True', 'life', 'horror', 'movies', 'can', 'be', 'just', 'enthralling', 'when', 'left', 'hands', 'capable', 'filmmaker', 'who', 'victims', 'same', 'time', 'presenting', 'honest', 'portrait', 'murder', 'Manson', 'Family', 'only', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'not', 'claim', 'be', 'fictional', 'documentary', 'movie-', 'weasel', 'way', 'categories', 'above.However', 'true', 'story', 'so', 'well', 'documented', 'still', 'so', 'prevalent', 'media', 'culture-', 'certain', 'significance', 'many', 'people', 'including', 'who', 'read', 'Helter', 'Skelter', 'Family', 'twice', 'addition', 'seeing', 'countless', 'other', 'films', 'made', '.To', 'see', 'shocking', 'real', 'life', 'murders', 'played', 'out', 'art', 'house', 'styl', 'really', 'injustice', 'actual', 'crimes', 'victims', 'victims', 'families', 'who', 'are', 'very', 'much', 'alive', 'well', 'day', 'Manson', 'Family', 'good', 'film', 'basis', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'too', 'much', 'actual', 'Manson', 'Family', 'History', 'more', 'know', 'more', 'respect', 'lose', 'Jim', 'Van', 'Bebber', 'vivid', 'retelling', 'murders', 'Manson', 'Family', 'film.I', 'also', 'thought', 'including', 'Charles', 'Manson', 'music', 'film', 'was', 'downright', 'appalling.Nobody', 'hear', 'crap']",The Manson Family

They started it in the late 80s, ran out of funds and took a long time to get it done. The acting is pretty amateurish, but then the actors were playing Manson's cast of 60s druggies and burnouts and are actually probably pretty close to the real flavor of the actual people involved. Manson himself is well done. Much nudity and crude violence. I was grateful that much of the stabbing and mutilating was depicted with such fake looking dummies. Otherwise, this would have been nauseating. I didn't know the background of the Manson family and this does a good job on the long lead-up to the famous Tate murders. They tack on a modern appendage of some 90s looking Goth kids murdering some modern TV producers. I wasn't sure what the point was.I did like the deliberate use of grain in the film to make it look like real news footage, and the switching back and forth from latter day interviews to the time of the killings was sort of effective.

I thought that it was a normal movie, but the best way to describe it is to say that it's not even a movie, it's just insanity! It doesn't really have a plot, most of the times you just see random bits of the Manson family's life, mostly them being naked (lots and lots of big tits), having orgies (one time while drinking dog blood and it's pretty disturbing), being high on acid and killing people in gory ways (the last 20 minutes or so are very gory!)! The other times you see them (the actors, not the real persons) a couple of years later talking about how life with Charles Manson was and there's a subplot taking places in the present about teens or young adults who worship Charles Manson and wants to be just like the Manson's family.

Hartley,"[6, 11]","Despite an ultra low budget and no-name cast, this 1996 independent feature from director Jim Van Bebber nonetheless rates as the most chilling and eerily effective dramatized evocation yet of the the Manson ""family"" and thier shocking 1969 murder spree. Just as in the ""Blair Witch Project"", the viewer will take away only what they bring with them. If you are a  ""slasher"" fan seeking only the visceral thrill of witnessing a gruesome re-enactment of the Tate-LaBianca slayings, that's exactly what you'll get (and you should seek psychiatric help). If you go in prepared to dismiss this as purely exploitative trash, then, yes, you will find plenty of spurting red Karo syrup and gratuitously naked hippy chicks to shake your head disapprovingly and cluck your tongue over. But if you are open-minded and willing to look just below the surface, you will discover intelligent filmmaking at work. In fact, ""The Manson Family"" is much less of an ""exploitation"" film than, say, the higher profile ""Natural Born Killers"". Oliver Stone has gone to great lengths to convince us that his film was a a misunderstood ""media satire"", but Van Bebber makes his point much more economically. Several key scenes in ""The Manson Family"" feature characters literally holding a mirror up to the camera; so perhaps it is not Charles Manson who fascinates us, Van Bebber seems to be saying, but the IDEA of a Charles Manson (or a Hitler, Jim Jones or Osama Bin Laden). What is it, we ask ourselves, that makes an otherwise ""normal"", intelligent person suddenly drop on all fours and merrily follow such misguided messianics into oblivion? This film comes the closest of any I've ever seen in realistically depicting circumstances that might enable this truly frightening type of transformation. DVD notes: The 2-disc version features an excellent doc with director and actor interviews. Some of the stories regarding on-set occurences will creep you out more than the film itself!

It's a bad trip that captures your attention from frame one, and it works on multiple levels.There have been reviews on here that trash this film and its subject matter.  Those reviews are misguided at best.  Sure, this may be an independent film, and therefore not as polished as the trite from major studios, but that fits the Manson saga.  Manson, his followers, and their deeds should never be Hollywoodized (a new word created just for this review).  Gritty stories deserve gritty movies, and that's what you get here.You can argue all you want about the subject matter and exploitation aspects (which are minimal at best), but you can't argue that the fact that this film is very well done and gets its point across in a way that is hard to forget.I'm not a Manson expert, fan or even all that interested (though I have the Amok book that I have yet to read and the LP), but this movie intrigued me.

Kary ""espice""","[3, 10]","I am no huge Manson family fan at all , but I must say it has intruiged me in some ways and growing up in the 70's you could not help but know the grissly horror tale of what Charlie and his family did to those poor innocent victims . I have read allot on that subject and of course seen all the tv movies and rentals that have came out on dvd . This version of what took place is much more vivid yet lacks allot of the truth of the actual crime scenes and what took place in 1969 at the Tate home . Vanbebber did get allot on the nose , but if he was going for the shock effect / gore effect and really wanted you to be there and witness what those poor people went through before they were killed , then he should have shown more on what happened to Jay Sebring and Sharon Tate . I know it would be just horrid to show her being stabbed to death while being pregnant , but wouldn't that have really made you think of the true horor that took place on that awful night and made you realize and think ... how on earth could any one on God's green earth do that to a pregnant woman and to Sharon Tate on top of that . I mean they were so drugged up and out of there minds that night , but did they even care who or what they did to all the victims ? Jim Vanbebber really should have done more with that actual part of the movie to really get you into what happened at the Tate home . Any way , Vanbebber did one hell of a good job with this film , but allot the acting was truly horrid in itself . I mean Marcello Games who played Charles Manson was an awful actor and gave such an unrealistic portrayal of the real man himself . I will say some good acting did take place in this film from Leslie Orr and Amy Yates . I mean they gave me the creeps with their crazy eyes , laughs and sort of made me feel like I was really watching the real cold blooded murderers on that dvd . I will say , if you are into Charles Manson and the Manson clan you will love this film . I must warn fans of Sharon Tate not to view this film because the actress playing her was just awful and did no justice to her beauty . Vanbebber did one amazing job with the actual budget he had and the length of time it actually took to make this film .

877914,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B000784WS6,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[4, 8]","I'd say I know about the Manson family/murders about as much as the average person. I know about their victims, their trial, their sentences, and Charlie Manson's CD. But, to tell you the truth, my knowledge about the whole debacle is, in reality, quite small. I've never seen ""Helter Skelter"" or any other movie about Manson...This one intrigued me because it had good reviews on the front (from Roger Ebert & Entertainment Weekly's Owen Glieberman). I want to begin by saying that the film is not 256 minutes, like the back cover said. It doesn't even pass 100 minutes. Anyway, the Helter Skelter movie was told from the lawyer's point-of-view. The Manson Family is meant to be told from the eyes of The Manson Family. Instead of just presenting it, it is set up as a producer splicing together interviews to create a Manson documentary. While these interviews play, we get glimpses into the life of Manson. Nothing really new. Charlie Manson, an aspiring musician and convict, got some followers to hang out with him at his ranch. They'd take drugs and have sex as often as possible, while all looking up to Manson as a heavenly figure. Eventually, he convinces them to commit murder (although they actually kill a black man first) which leads to the Tate-LaBianca killings. There are a lot of problems with the movie. One of them is that almost the entire movie is too damn campy. None of the scenes that take place at The Ranch creeped me out or disturbed me at all. I didn't laugh at any point during the movie, but I found a lot of scenes laughable. There's also a ridiculous sub-plot about a bunch of Manson worshipping kids, who are plotting to kill the producer that's viewing the interview footage. The most effective scenes come from the Tate-LaBianca killing scenes. They are truly horrifying to watch, especially when the woman supposed to be Sharon Tate begs for the life of her baby. The movie is told like a documentary and has cinematography that gives it a look of a 1970s movie. I mean, it doesn't even look purposefully done that way. It looks very 70s-ish. This makes those scenes more effective. Another thing that led to the downfall was the producer and the Manson worshippers. If this movie had been solely about The Manson Family, cutting all that other stuff out, even with the camp left in...This would've been a better film. I was tempted to give it 4 stars, but I'm going to give it 3 (well 3 1/2)...I did find those murder scenes disturbing and haunting. The acting is good, but the actors (since they are playing drug users) do way too much overacting. I even thought the guy playing Manson was overacting, until I watched the Charlie Manson interview on the 2nd disc where I realize that the actor is sedated compared to the real Manson. The interview is interesting though. There's one last problem with this film I wanted to point out. I usually don't even care about something like this, but in this film it bothered me. Most films that deal with this subject matter try to present a reason why these people would do something like this. This film seems to just want to exploit the fact that it happened. It tries to pin the reason on LSD, marijuana, and brainwashing...But that seems like an easy way out. I don't think anyone can truly pin down what occurred at that ranch to make these people do what they did, but the writer/director could have at least attempted a character study to get into the psyche of these characters. It doesn't even seem like this goal was in his mind. This is not a film I would watch again. I, personally, don't know why anyone would want to submit themselves to this again. If you really want to see it that bad, rent it first.GRADE: C+",4,"Campy, Occasionally Disturbing...Usually Stupid.",1163548800,"11 15, 2006",2006,3706,"[""'d"", 'say', 'know', 'Manson', 'family/murders', 'as', 'much', 'average', 'person', 'know', 'victims', 'trial', 'sentences', 'Charlie', 'Manson', 'CD', 'tell', 'truth', 'knowledge', 'whole', 'debacle', 'reality', 'quite', 'small', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'Helter', 'Skelter', 'other', 'movie', 'Manson', 'one', 'intrigued', 'had', 'good', 'reviews', 'front', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'Entertainment', 'Weekly', 'Owen', 'Glieberman', 'want', 'begin', 'saying', 'film', 'not', '256', 'minutes', 'back', 'cover', 'said', ""n't"", 'even', 'pass', '100', 'minutes', 'Anyway', 'Helter', 'Skelter', 'movie', 'was', 'told', 'lawyer', 'point-of-view', 'Manson', 'Family', 'meant', 'be', 'told', 'eyes', 'Manson', 'Family', 'Instead', 'just', 'presenting', 'set', 'up', 'producer', 'splicing', 'together', 'interviews', 'create', 'Manson', 'documentary', 'interviews', 'play', 'get', 'glimpses', 'life', 'Manson', 'Nothing', 'really', 'new', 'Charlie', 'Manson', 'aspiring', 'musician', 'convict', 'got', 'followers', 'hang', 'out', 'ranch', ""'d"", 'take', 'drugs', 'have', 'sex', 'as', 'often', 'possible', 'looking', 'up', 'Manson', 'heavenly', 'figure', 'Eventually', 'commit', 'murder', 'actually', 'kill', 'black', 'man', 'first', 'Tate-LaBianca', 'killings', 'are', 'lot', 'problems', 'movie', 'One', 'almost', 'entire', 'movie', 'too', 'damn', 'campy', 'None', 'scenes', 'take', 'place', 'Ranch', 'creeped', 'out', 'disturbed', 'did', ""n't"", 'laugh', 'point', 'movie', 'found', 'lot', 'scenes', 'laughable', 'also', 'ridiculous', 'sub-plot', 'bunch', 'Manson', 'worshipping', 'kids', 'who', 'are', 'plotting', 'kill', 'producer', 'viewing', 'interview', 'footage', 'most', 'effective', 'scenes', 'come', 'Tate-LaBianca', 'killing', 'scenes', 'are', 'truly', 'horrifying', 'watch', 'especially', 'when', 'woman', 'supposed', 'be', 'Sharon', 'Tate', 'begs', 'life', 'baby', 'movie', 'told', 'documentary', 'cinematography', 'look', '1970s', 'movie', 'mean', ""n't"", 'even', 'look', 'purposefully', 'done', 'way', 'very', '70s-ish', 'scenes', 'more', 'effective', 'thing', 'led', 'downfall', 'was', 'producer', 'Manson', 'worshippers', 'movie', 'had', 'been', 'solely', 'Manson', 'Family', 'cutting', 'other', 'stuff', 'even', 'camp', 'left', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'better', 'film', 'was', 'tempted', 'give', '4', 'stars', ""'m"", 'going', 'give', '3', 'well', '3', '1/2', 'did', 'find', 'murder', 'scenes', 'disturbing', 'haunting', 'acting', 'good', 'actors', 'are', 'playing', 'drug', 'users', 'do', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'overacting', 'even', 'thought', 'guy', 'playing', 'Manson', 'was', 'overacting', 'watched', 'Charlie', 'Manson', 'interview', '2nd', 'disc', 'where', 'realize', 'actor', 'sedated', 'compared', 'real', 'Manson', 'interview', 'interesting', 'one', 'last', 'problem', 'film', 'wanted', 'point', 'out', 'usually', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'care', 'something', 'film', 'bothered', 'Most', 'films', 'deal', 'subject', 'matter', 'try', 'present', 'reason', 'why', 'people', 'would', 'do', 'something', 'film', 'just', 'want', 'exploit', 'fact', 'happened', 'pin', 'reason', 'LSD', 'marijuana', 'brainwashing', 'easy', 'way', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'anyone', 'can', 'truly', 'pin', 'down', 'what', 'occurred', 'ranch', 'make', 'people', 'do', 'what', 'did', 'writer/director', 'could', 'have', 'least', 'attempted', 'character', 'study', 'get', 'psyche', 'characters', ""n't"", 'even', 'seem', 'goal', 'was', 'mind', 'not', 'film', 'would', 'watch', 'again', 'personally', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'anyone', 'would', 'want', 'submit', 'again', 'really', 'want', 'see', 'bad', 'rent', 'first.GRADE', 'C+']",The Manson Family

877916,A3G602Z4DWDZKS,B000784WS6,Matthew King,"[6, 9]","We'll all heard of the atrocities that happened on that fateful night in August 1969 when actress Sharon Tate and her guests were brutally murdered at the hands of crazed fanatics.  Since that night Charles Manson has been reviled (and by some people glorified) as one of the most notorious serial killers in American history.  Most average people, while referring to mass murderers will say his name before almost anyone else, even though body count wise he can&#8217;t hold a candle to people like John Wayne Gacy or Gary Ridgeway.  Here&#8217;s a news flash for those not in the know: Manson was not a serial killer.  He wasn&#8217;t the one who plunged the knives in the bodies of the victims, heck he wasn&#8217;t even in that house.  While Manson definitely belongs locked safely in a cell for the rest of his days for masterminding the attacks, his rep as a notorious mass murderer is a myth that director Jim Van Bebber tries to demystify in his film The Manson Family, placing the spotlight on the other members of the Manson cult.The Manson Family is what can be referred to as a &#8220;mockumentary&#8221;, a film told in documentary format except that the people recounting the events are actors and the footage shot is not real but fictitious.  Throughout the movie, we hear testimony from the 5 members of Manson&#8217;s &#8220;family&#8221;, who have been incarcerated for life for their part in the killings and we watch as they recount events from their past.  We see how they first met Charles, a struggling musician who took them under his wing.  We see how the group would go to a ranch owned by one of Charlie&#8217;s friends and engage in sex orgys, acid trips and marijuana smoking.  Mostly harmless fun, typical of the love generation.  Then as the movie progresses things take on a darker tone, especially as Manson&#8217;s recording career suffers backseat after backseat from record producers, he is morphing into a madman.  His hatred for the establishment and for people he judged &#8220;different&#8221; leads him to form Helter Skelter, an operation in which innocent people, such as Tate and her friends were murdered.  Manson believed that the killings would be framed on the Black Panthers, which would result in a race war in which Charlie would be the leader.  Or something like that.  I guess I don&#8217;t need to tell you that he wasn&#8217;t the most well-adjusted individual.Before anyone casts misplaced judgment on this film realize that director Jim Van Bebber is not at all trying to glorify Manson or the killings.  Quite the opposite.  Van Bebber portrays Manson as a desperate loon and his tribe as crazed worshippers while still attempting to place a human face on them.  This is an independent film in the true sense of the word as Van Bebber slaved over nearly 12 years and countless roadblocks of financing and studio rejection along the way.  His picture is gritty, brutal and uncompromising.  If you do not have a very high tolerance for on-screen violence, do not watch this film.  It actually starts off rather innocently and the entire first half of the film contains nothing graphic or disturbing whatsoever, as it concentrates on profiling the group and its members.  As the film builds to a crescendo we are shown in shockingly graphic detail the atrocities and the murders.  We watch as heads get blown off, as cult members stab repeatedly their victims dozens of times over, all the while referring to them as &#8220;pigs&#8221;.  The film hits a crescendo as the killers enter the Sharon Tate mansion and every single scene is displayed in excruciatingly graphic detail.  No details are spared, except for one, the hanging of Sharon Tate&#8217;s foetus.  In the special features section, Van Bebber, director of &#8220;Deadbeat at Dawn&#8221; and not one usually known for restraint, says that including that scene simply would have been going too far.  I agree.The only thing that bothered me was how much Charles was put in the background and how he is portrayed as a rather foolish character, one who says nothing of value and who lacks any charisma whatsoever.  I realize VanBebber&#8217;s intent with the film was to put Manson&#8217;s &#8220;family&#8221; in the foreground but I at least would have liked to get a glimpse of what made him so seducing as to be able to convince a group of people to buy into Helter Skelter and commit such inhuman acts.

You get basic editing, basic camera work and no evidence the filmmaker has any signature style at all.The Manson Family is visually a dazzling film and it's disjointed chaotic look goes along way in helping depict the insanity which enveloped the family members during the times leading up to those two horrible nights in 1969.Jim Van Bebber probably spent alot of time studying Robert Hendrickson's 1973 documentary Manson.  He apes the psychedelic feel of that movie and actually quotes scenes and words from that film when he shows the girls on the garbage runs and also Lyn Fromme and Sandra Good sitting on the table with guns saying that ""snitches will be taken care of""Van Bebber also appears to have taken some cues from Oliver Stone's Natural Born Killers (a film that features Manson as an inspiration to Mickey & Mallory) in regards to the directors usage of quick cut montage scenes interspersing images from the past, future, ""stock"" and ""newsreel"" footage as well as interviews with the protagonists.The result of all this is a very effective film which does a better job than any other film (including any real life documentary) of depicting the Manson Family and their continuing fascination for so many people today.The film reaches greatness in the mock documentary parts framed by present day interviews of the family members in prison each giving their own, often contrasting views on the events and who did what exactly.The film is less successful in some of the more drawn out scenes where the lack of budget and inexperienced actors become more of a liability.  The present day scenes with the industrial junkie kids are confusing at first but by the end I understood why Van Bebber included them in the movie and they made total sense.Also, with the 2 disk edition you get two fascinating documentaries which are must viewing for anyone interested in independent filmmaking.Great value at &9.99",4,An Extremely Well Made Exploitation Film,1258416000,"11 17, 2009",2009,2120,"['do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'then', 'compare', 'Manson', 'Family', 'serial', 'killer/crime', 'films', 'produced', 'Tartan', 'Video', ""'ll"", 'see', 'difference.Those', 'films', 'have', 'absolutely', 'filmmaking', 'style', 'get', 'basic', 'editing', 'basic', 'camera', 'work', 'evidence', 'filmmaker', 'signature', 'style', 'all.The', 'Manson', 'Family', 'visually', 'dazzling', 'film', 'disjointed', 'chaotic', 'look', 'along', 'way', 'helping', 'depict', 'insanity', 'enveloped', 'family', 'members', 'times', 'leading', 'up', 'two', 'horrible', 'nights', '1969.Jim', 'Van', 'Bebber', 'probably', 'spent', 'alot', 'time', 'studying', 'Robert', 'Hendrickson', '1973', 'documentary', 'Manson', 'psychedelic', 'feel', 'movie', 'actually', 'scenes', 'words', 'film', 'when', 'girls', 'garbage', 'runs', 'also', 'Lyn', 'Fromme', 'Sandra', 'Good', 'sitting', 'table', 'guns', 'saying', 'snitches', 'will', 'be', 'taken', 'care', 'Van', 'Bebber', 'also', 'have', 'taken', 'cues', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'Natural', 'Born', 'Killers', 'film', 'Manson', 'inspiration', 'Mickey', 'Mallory', 'regards', 'directors', 'usage', 'quick', 'cut', 'montage', 'scenes', 'interspersing', 'images', 'past', 'future', 'stock', 'newsreel', 'footage', 'as', 'well', 'interviews', 'protagonists.The', 'result', 'very', 'effective', 'film', 'better', 'job', 'other', 'film', 'including', 'real', 'life', 'documentary', 'depicting', 'Manson', 'Family', 'continuing', 'fascination', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'today.The', 'film', 'reaches', 'greatness', 'mock', 'documentary', 'parts', 'framed', 'present', 'day', 'interviews', 'family', 'members', 'prison', 'giving', 'own', 'often', 'contrasting', 'views', 'events', 'who', 'did', 'what', 'exactly.The', 'film', 'less', 'successful', 'more', 'drawn', 'scenes', 'where', 'lack', 'budget', 'inexperienced', 'actors', 'become', 'more', 'liability', 'present', 'day', 'scenes', 'industrial', 'junkie', 'kids', 'are', 'confusing', 'first', 'end', 'understood', 'why', 'Van', 'Bebber', 'included', 'movie', 'made', 'total', 'sense.Also', '2', 'disk', 'edition', 'get', 'two', 'fascinating', 'documentaries', 'are', 'must', 'viewing', 'anyone', 'interested', 'independent', 'filmmaking.Great', 'value', '9.99']",The Manson Family

When I realized that this was not just a flashy open credits sequence... and that the WHOLE FILM looks like this, I settled in for the ride and loved every second of it.JVB masterfully re-creates the drug-trippy filmmaking quirks of the 60's and uses these techniques to bring a visually vibrant, hellish storm to the screen.  This unsettling edge, this bloodsplattered, uncontrollable death ride is exactly the tone a movie about America's most infamous cult leader and death bringer should have.  It is respectful to the historical events that inspired the film... and it makes for fascinating cinema.The only really weak thing about this movie is the acting.  Most of the cast is fantastic and very believable.  Unfortunately, a few bad actors are mixed in here and there.

Van Bebber and company did a spectacular job in displaying what life might have been like within the Manson family community and as accurately as possible showing the how and why the crimes were committed. It plays out as a psychedelic pseudo docudrama with great acting and great script. The film also has a 70ish true grindhouse feel which helped as it took the viewer back to the days of free love and flower power of the late sixties. the print was a work in progress as the Director took the film to various film festivals until the director finally felt he had a good cut of the film. Well, good became great as this film has attained a cult following. Phil Anselmo (The voice of Satan)is featuring the film at the Housecore Horror film festival.

The film has been trying to get distribution and finished for some time so I grabbed the opportunity to watch it.  Van Bebber has done a stirling job in capturing the Manson phenomena and has created a unique,chilling and satisfying cinema experience.  The film is influenced by 60's trip cinema, inevitable to reflect the times that these horrendous crimes were committed. The budget that Bebber was working to adds to the creativity of the flick and builds more atmosphere than a thousand big budget productions.  The murders are presented graphically without compromise which further illustrates the extent these people had become removed from their earlier hippy pretensions to savage merciless murderers.  Very well shot and edited the film will not appeal to everyone as it does not follow a traditional linear narrative.  The documentary feel of the film works well which further replicates the heavy media association that the crimes originally had.  The Manson trial was the end of the summer of love and I think Bebber illustrates this by the film at the end catching fire which is very similar to Two Lane Blacktop a film which also symbolised the end of the sixties.  A truly original piece of cinema which will appeal to cinephiles with a wide ranging knowledge of films and the crimes themselves. Everybody has a right to an opinion but the reveiwer who gave this film one star is not saying anything in his reveiw but the fact that he needs to get back to his Troma films.  This film is well worth a watch and you well get a lot out of it subtle references to Jim Jones, the celebrity status killers receive through the media.

""The Manson Family"" is a very interesting view of the events that preceded the infamous killings and how they culminated in the very murders themselves. Using a multiple time phase structure, the film moves back and forth between the past and present of the main characters involved in the murders. This results in a story that tries to show the killers as being ""removed"" from the actual crime, as if they were not really there and they comment on it in the third person. Essentially exactly what they do when going up for parole hearings. The film is very rough, scenes are filled with scratches and other defects that bring a documentary feel to the proceedings, as if the Manson Family themselves were behind the camera. The culmination of the film with the multiple murders presents them in a highly graphic and factual way which is to the benefit of the presentation. While all the talk and posturing was peace and love, to see the horrendous murders truly puts things in perspective. This is a great movie for people into true crime stories and for those looking for a realistic portrayal of the Manson story. The DVD also contains an excellent documentary concerning no budget, renegade filmmaking. This documentary interviews many directors of these types of film and is very insightful into the passions of these people. Other extras include a revealing interview with Manson himself which, if nothing else, indicates why he will die in prison.

The assumption that modern Manson chic (t-shirts, music, etc.) has anything to do with the real Charles Manson really grinds the movie to a screeching halt.Thankfully that's a minor part of the movie. The rest of the movie is a scary creepy experience as a group of idealistic and clueless hippies get involved with a sociopath (or a couple of sociopaths if you count Bobby that claims to have his own ""family"") and things go from sex & drugs to guns and murder. You can see how Manson manipulates these people (some even brainwashed to this day) with group therapy speak about opening themselves up and erasing their egos. Hippie speak about ""Manson didn't want to sell out to the MAN"" or ""Life and Death are just two states"" or ""Death is a beautiful thing"" takes on sinister overtones as the movie progresses. The back-and-forth between interviews and scenes weaves a powerful spell as we see the people as they represent themselves now, see how they were and then see them lie about what happened - maybe even lying to themselves.In the end this movie is a fascinating meditation on the way sociopaths can prety on the outcasts of society and how a mind can be manipulated into justifying horrible things.

Not the worst, but far from the best. First problem is a decent chunk of the movie concerns a fictional, modern day gang of Nazi punks that are into S & M and are a sort of Manson-worshipping cult. It has nothing to do with anything and is just a waste of screen time. Second is that the movie bounces back and forth through the years with recreations of interviews and dramatizations with no linear through-line, so unless you're very familiar with the case and all the participants, one would be forgiven for being fairly confused at times with who is being portrayed and at what point in time the action is supposed to be taking place. Also, there are factual inconsistencies with what is known and agreed on in the case by both authorities and Family members alike. Granted it is a docu-drama, but at least get the facts straight!

It is not glamorized or sensastionalized at all. It is brutal and sometimes difficult to watch. I think it shows the b.s. that was Charles Manson and his band of idiots. Van Bebber did an excellent job of researching and getting to the heart of the characters and how they were. He said he never spoke to any of the Manson family cause from what he read they were all full of it and tried to spin it the best way they could to help themselves as individuals. It also delves into the real motivation of the killings which was not about ""Helter Skelter"" and a race war which is a prosecution gimmick to convict Manson but simply and stupidly an attempt to make it seem like Bobby Beausillae did not kill Gary Hinman and to make it look like the real killer/killers were still at large so he could get out of  a murder rap.The documentary that goes with this movie is as good as the movie. It is an amazing tail of independent film making. This guy Van Bebber was driven to make this work and to make his movie. It took him years and running out of money and then getting the same people together year after year to do another piece of the film.This is an independent film and is rough around the edges but I enjoyed it very much.

The flashback scenes were filmed in the late 80s, the modern day interview scenes were filmed in the late 90s if not in 2000. If you have a look at that or just youtube Something Weird Video and look at their 60s hippy acid flicks you'll see roughly the same thing. The only thing that really hurts this movie is the useless subplot of stereotypical late 90s Columbine-ish kids listening to industrial music, dressing weird plotting to kill. It doesn't help the film at all and really drags it down.As corny as this movie can be, if you can view it with a sense of humor you'll find this movie is either pure genius or accidentally good. The older scenes in the movie were pretty much an entirely separate and meant to stand as their own film, Van Bebber waking up from a decade of stagnant alcoholism went back seeing a cheesy movie and worked it into some far more restrained realistic scenes. And I'll repeat myself, a mock TV documentary like musicians reminiscing on Woodstock with mock 60s footage to match.  It works well, its gory and cheesy and trash cinema yes but if you look a bit closer its got a raw power to it. With all these directors trying to ape the old trash cinema style, like Rob Zombie  or take your pick really, Jim Van Bebber actually gathers it together and makes it into art instead of a throwaway night at the movies. And if you're a Deadbeat at Dawn fan this shouldn't disappoint.The extras on this disc are very revealing. My personal favorite was this film showing at a horror fest which in my opinion is depressing. I can understand if there were films like Bad Taste or Evil Dead 2 or anything remotely resembling talent but movies like Aftermath, the utterly terrible Dust Devil and some unfinished POS by a ""director"" that starts crying (he's asked some simple direct questions by some critics who just viewed some unedited soundless footage of bad latex/karo syrup effects) is sad sad sad. Jim Van Bebber's film deserved a better wider audience but if he's stuck in cinema ghetto its his own fault. The other documentary shows Van Bebber pretty much falling to pieces after Deadbeat At Dawn filming the first half of this film, then drinking, losing partners, his studio, everything from just drinking. He finally the finishes the movie a decade later, if there's ever been a film to warn against overindulgence of mind altering chemicals its right here! It really had an effect on me, drinking alot myself the time I saw it.
