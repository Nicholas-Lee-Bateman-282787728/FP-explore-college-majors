I have to say that the time passed faster here than when watching many other movies, even though not much actually happens. Most scenes are full of sensibility and intelligence, although some are more hit-and-miss.

711773,A328S9RN3U5M68,B00006CXH1,Grady Harp,"[21, 21]","SPRING FORWARD has been released on DVD and hopefully will be featured in displays that will garner the atttention this superb film deserves but lacked during its theatrical release.  This is a quietly powerful film, made all the more so because it is created in such a simple, straight forward, coverstational style. This is one of the finest scripts for a film in many years. And Director Tom Gilroy allows the concepts and messages it contains to speak clearly and in an unfettered fashion that drives the points of the story home in the most sincerely beautiful say imaginable.Ned Beatty adds yet another crown to his acting career as the aging, Parks and Recreation worker who gives employment to a newly relased from prison lost youth (Liev Schreiber) and in doing so changes the misguided young man into to a solidly complete human being.  Beatty owns this role - the father of a gay son in a small town who has been the victim of homophobia and now is dying of AIDS, while the father mourns the fact he has never been able to  relate how deeply he loves this son.  These life lessons pour into Paul (Liev Schreiber) who is hungry for acceptance and a sense of future in a world he sees as shallow and offensive.  The manner in which these two men slowly develop a relationship that nurtures each other's needs is marked by encounters with small town people who are perceptively defined by superior cameo actors such as Peri Gilpin, Campbell Scott and others whos names fly by too quickly in the final screen credits.  The four seasons in this unidentified New England town have rarely been so beautifully captures both in scenery and in the adaptive lifestyles each season commands.  But some of the rarest moments are just the quiet, humor-laced, emotionally sensitive simple conversations tha grow between the two main character men.  For example, in a discussion about reading, Beatty asks Schreiber about poetry and Scbrieber alludes to the fact that Native Americans use the same word for ""breathing"" as they do for ""poetry"", that the importance of making poems is the importance of living each day.Oh, this film is rich in simple philosophy, in the glow of real friendship, in the interplay of each of us as caring, involved-in-living individuals on this communal planet.

711776,A18P0T2NZTGWYX,B00006CXH1,J. Martin,"[3, 6]","Based on the description and reviews, I expected to like this movie a lot. My very favorite kind of movie is one in which not much happens except character development, and it sounded like that's exactly what Spring Forward was. In a way that's true, but the characters need to be believable, and these aren't.What makes them unbelievable, and ultimately even annoying, is the way they talk. It's not just that they talk too much--people do that all the time. It's always tiring, in a movie or in real life, but endless talking isn't in itself unrealistic. The problem here is that every word Beatty and Schreiber say sounds mechanical, choreographed, uniform both in tone and in pace, like an elaborate mantra instead of spontaneous human speech, as if there's a metronome we can't hear setting the unvarying pace of everything they say, and an automatic volume control keeping them from ever raising or lowering their voices outside an artificially narrow range. It makes for an artificial, emotionally flat, and (for me) unpleasant experience. It's exactly what I'd expect of a movie made completely under hypnosis.Normally I feel obligated to watch a movie all the way to the end before writing about it, afraid that I'll criticize it unfairly because I missed something at the end that transcends the beginning. That has almost happened a few times, and I still feel that obligation, but I think I'm going to ignore it this time. After all, movies are entertainment. If a movie doesn't make me want to keep watching it, the movie has failed, not me. I stuck with this one through Peri Gilpin's cameo, which indeed is very good, but she is just as much under the spell of the unseen hypnotist as the leads are, and that's what I can't stand. It makes the whole movie feel flat and unreal, even creepy.I assume it's the director's responsibility to set the pace of a movie, which in this case is just too measured, too tight, too unrelentingly uniform. I know all these actors are very gifted performers because I've enjoyed and admired them for years. And WHAT they say isn't so bad, so it's not primarily a problem with the screenplay (although it IS somewhat pretentious, but no more than I am). So I attribute the surprising failure of Spring Forward to the director, who should have let these characters talk a little less and just BE a little more. Flashes of real anger, stupidity or selfishness would have been nice, a little wildness, something messy, an occasional lapse of self-control, even periods of awkward or comfortable silence. In other words, something human.I'm sorry, but I have to join the tiny minority at the bottom of the ratings chart.",2,Surprisingly flat and disappointing,1243555200,"05 29, 2009",2009,2664,"['Based', 'description', 'reviews', 'expected', 'like', 'movie', 'lot', 'very', 'favorite', 'kind', 'movie', 'one', 'not', 'much', 'happens', 'character', 'development', 'sounded', 'exactly', 'what', 'Spring', 'Forward', 'was', 'way', 'true', 'characters', 'need', 'be', 'believable', 'unbelievable', 'ultimately', 'even', 'annoying', 'way', 'talk', 'not', 'just', 'talk', 'too', 'much', 'people', 'do', 'time', 'always', 'tiring', 'movie', 'real', 'life', 'endless', 'talking', ""n't"", 'unrealistic', 'problem', 'here', 'word', 'Beatty', 'Schreiber', 'say', 'mechanical', 'choreographed', 'uniform', 'tone', 'pace', 'elaborate', 'mantra', 'instead', 'spontaneous', 'human', 'speech', 'metronome', 'ca', ""n't"", 'hear', 'setting', 'unvarying', 'pace', 'everything', 'say', 'automatic', 'volume', 'control', 'keeping', 'ever', 'raising', 'lowering', 'voices', 'artificially', 'narrow', 'range', 'artificial', 'emotionally', 'flat', 'unpleasant', 'experience', 'exactly', 'what', ""'d"", 'expect', 'movie', 'made', 'completely', 'hypnosis.Normally', 'feel', 'obligated', 'watch', 'movie', 'way', 'end', 'writing', 'afraid', ""'ll"", 'criticize', 'unfairly', 'missed', 'something', 'end', 'beginning', 'almost', 'happened', 'few', 'times', 'still', 'feel', 'obligation', 'think', ""'m"", 'going', 'ignore', 'time', 'movies', 'are', 'entertainment', 'movie', ""n't"", 'make', 'want', 'keep', 'watching', 'movie', 'failed', 'not', 'stuck', 'one', 'Peri', 'Gilpin', 'cameo', 'indeed', 'very', 'good', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'spell', 'unseen', 'hypnotist', 'leads', 'are', 'what', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'whole', 'movie', 'feel', 'flat', 'unreal', 'even', 'creepy.I', 'assume', 'director', 'responsibility', 'set', 'pace', 'movie', 'case', 'just', 'too', 'measured', 'too', 'tight', 'too', 'unrelentingly', 'uniform', 'know', 'actors', 'are', 'very', 'gifted', 'performers', ""'ve"", 'enjoyed', 'admired', 'years', 'WHAT', 'say', ""n't"", 'so', 'bad', 'not', 'primarily', 'problem', 'screenplay', 'somewhat', 'pretentious', 'more', 'am', 'attribute', 'surprising', 'failure', 'Spring', 'Forward', 'director', 'who', 'should', 'have', 'let', 'characters', 'talk', 'little', 'less', 'just', 'BE', 'little', 'more', 'Flashes', 'real', 'anger', 'stupidity', 'selfishness', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'little', 'wildness', 'something', 'messy', 'occasional', 'lapse', 'self-control', 'even', 'periods', 'awkward', 'comfortable', 'silence', 'other', 'words', 'something', 'human.I', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'have', 'join', 'tiny', 'minority', 'bottom', 'ratings', 'chart']",Spring Forward

Most of the people I know would have no patience to sit through Spring Forward probably because it's a slow moving character study and involves no action.  No guns, car chases, or explosions, just wonderfully written dialogue and strong fleshed-out characters.  These days those qualities seem to be in such short supply and that's one of the reasons I loved every minute of this film.The movie follows two Parks Department workers around on their daily errands.  Harold(Ned Beatty)is the veteran who is on the verge of retirement and Paul(Liev Schreiber)is the new guy who just got out of jail for armed robbery.  I knew what to expect from Beatty but was greatly surprised by Schreiber's performance--he was brilliant throughout.  I never even heard of him before this movie.The movie moves at its own pace, which is rather slow, but once I got into it the time went by rather quickly.  The only conflict in the movie stems from Paul and his inclination toward self-desctruction.  Paul's hit on some bad times and things haven't been looking up, but he seems like a decent guy who's trying to improve himself.  Harold sees that and trys to give him some guidance without being overbearing.  In return, Paul helps Harold deal with some guilt he feels towards his seriously ill son.  The relationship that develops between the two men is truly special and handled with any hint of sentimentality.I saw Spring Forward on a recommendation from a friend at work and couldn't thank him enough after I had watched it.  I watch a lot of movies but there always seem to be some great ones that I haven't seen and love the feeling of discovering them for the first time.

But what struck me most, listening to the DVD late at night under headphones so as to not disturb my family, was the sound.The outdoor scenes, of which there are many, are phenomenally recorded.  There is a 3-D depth and presence to the soundscapes that you rarely hear even in the majors.  Do yourself a favor and experience the movie on headphones.",5,Excellent on Headphones,1034208000,"10 10, 2002",2002,767,"['fine', 'character', 'study', 'everything', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'stated', 'compassionate', 'understated', 'intelligent', 'Ned', 'Beatty', 'still', 'one', 'favorite', 'actors.Ca', ""n't"", 'add', 'anything', 'what', 'others', 'already', 'said', ""'ll"", 'go', 'off', 'slight', 'tangent', 'obviously', 'low-budget', 'movie', 'quot', 'Spring', 'Forward', 'quot', 'gorgeous', 'production', 'values', 'Great', 'lighting', 'great', 'camerawork', 'excellent', 'editing', 'beautiful', 'score', 'what', 'struck', 'most', 'listening', 'DVD', 'late', 'night', 'headphones', 'so', 'not', 'disturb', 'family', 'was', 'sound.The', 'outdoor', 'scenes', 'are', 'many', 'are', 'phenomenally', 'recorded', '3-D', 'depth', 'presence', 'soundscapes', 'rarely', 'hear', 'even', 'majors', 'Do', 'favor', 'experience', 'movie', 'headphones']",Spring Forward
