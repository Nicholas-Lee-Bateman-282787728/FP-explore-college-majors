333234,AUHG8KSHI529U,6302768039,Craig Matteson,"[6, 6]","What I like most about this movie is its refusal to let any point of view win for too long.  Sure, Jonas Nightengale is a con man, but he puts on a great show that people love.  Many questions are raised by this kind of preacher-congregation relationship.  Certainly, this is not saying that all preachers or priests are con men (or is it?), nor is it implying that all religious believers are dupes, fools, or simply an audience watching a show (or is it?).One of the questions raised is whether the whole religious idea is all just a scam, as Jonas Nightengale embodies it.  Obviously not, but it is also true that this kind of scam has a long tradition (read the Canterbury Tales) and continues in full vigor today.  The next question is whether the insincerity of the preacher invalidates the faith of the believer.  Again, obviously not.  However, are believer often too gullible?  Absolutely.This movie is populated with all kinds of believers, non-believers, scammers, scam - enablers, doubters, and more.  It is interesting how each of their stories comes up against what Nightengale represents.  In some ways he is a screen onto whom they project their doubts, fears, hopes, and dreams.  Is that what religion is?  For some, maybe.  However, I think that such an explanation is really more attractive to non-believers than a real explanation of how religion functions in the lives of believers (not just audiences of folks who are just religious attendees).The movie does raise the issue of what happens when real belief - actual faith - runs into the scam.  I cannot divulge the end of the movie, but it isn't pat in its answer.  You can explain it according to your own lights.  As a believer, I have a certain view of what the story is getting at.  But the story really is more about raising questions to think about rather than trying to insist on a viewpoint of belief or rejection of belief.  It even looks at why people might choose to believe or not based on reasons that actually have nothing to do with questions of faith.The lack of an easy answer to what the movie is about might bother some, but I think it makes it more meaningful for most people.  For people of faith, some aspects of Nightengale's scam will feel like the blaspheme they are, but I would urge them to be patient to see where things lead.  Remember the story of Saul leads to Damascus by way of the martyrdom of Stephen.  No, Nightengale does not become Paul, but just wait.",4,Raises questions to consider rather than creating doubt.,1147219200,"05 10, 2006",2006,2464,"['What', 'like', 'most', 'movie', 'refusal', 'let', 'point', 'view', 'win', 'too', 'long', 'Sure', 'Jonas', 'Nightengale', 'con', 'man', 'great', 'show', 'people', 'love', 'Many', 'questions', 'are', 'raised', 'kind', 'preacher-congregation', 'relationship', 'Certainly', 'not', 'saying', 'preachers', 'priests', 'are', 'con', 'men', 'implying', 'religious', 'believers', 'are', 'dupes', 'fools', 'simply', 'audience', 'watching', 'show', '.One', 'questions', 'raised', 'whole', 'religious', 'idea', 'just', 'scam', 'Jonas', 'Nightengale', 'Obviously', 'not', 'also', 'true', 'kind', 'scam', 'long', 'tradition', 'read', 'Canterbury', 'Tales', 'full', 'vigor', 'today', 'next', 'question', 'insincerity', 'preacher', 'faith', 'believer', 'Again', 'obviously', 'not', 'However', 'are', 'believer', 'often', 'too', 'gullible', 'Absolutely.This', 'movie', 'populated', 'kinds', 'believers', 'non-believers', 'scammers', 'scam', 'enablers', 'doubters', 'more', 'interesting', 'how', 'stories', 'up', 'what', 'Nightengale', 'ways', 'screen', 'whom', 'project', 'doubts', 'fears', 'hopes', 'dreams', 'what', 'religion', 'maybe', 'However', 'think', 'explanation', 'really', 'more', 'attractive', 'non-believers', 'real', 'explanation', 'how', 'religion', 'functions', 'lives', 'believers', 'not', 'just', 'audiences', 'folks', 'who', 'are', 'just', 'religious', 'attendees', '.The', 'movie', 'raise', 'issue', 'what', 'when', 'real', 'belief', 'actual', 'faith', 'scam', 'can', 'not', 'divulge', 'end', 'movie', ""n't"", 'pat', 'answer', 'can', 'explain', 'according', 'own', 'lights', 'believer', 'have', 'certain', 'view', 'what', 'story', 'getting', 'story', 'really', 'more', 'raising', 'questions', 'think', 'rather', 'trying', 'insist', 'viewpoint', 'belief', 'rejection', 'belief', 'even', 'why', 'people', 'might', 'choose', 'believe', 'not', 'based', 'reasons', 'actually', 'have', 'nothing', 'do', 'questions', 'faith.The', 'lack', 'easy', 'answer', 'what', 'movie', 'about', 'might', 'bother', 'think', 'more', 'meaningful', 'most', 'people', 'people', 'faith', 'aspects', 'Nightengale', 'scam', 'will', 'feel', 'blaspheme', 'are', 'would', 'urge', 'be', 'patient', 'see', 'where', 'things', 'lead', 'Remember', 'story', 'Saul', 'Damascus', 'way', 'martyrdom', 'Stephen', 'No', 'Nightengale', 'not', 'become', 'Paul', 'just', 'wait']",N/A

I loved the story of the con man who got caught in his own con and I experienced the same joy watching Steve Martin do his own version of Prof. Harold Hill (now Jonas Nightengale) in ""Leap of Faith.""This movie was truly misunderstood by most critics who tried to compare it -unfavorably- with such films as ""Elmer Gantry"" or characterize it as a statement on televangelism. They also focused too heavily on the emotional, and therefore, ""unrealistic"" ending. Even worse, the studio mis-marketed the film, and you'll often find it in the comedy section of the video store. Warning: it is not a comedy. Yes, there are light moments- how can there not be with Steve Martin- but this film is much richer than a typical Steve Martin comedy.Steve Martin's performance is superb and magical and should have been nominated for an Oscar. The film score is tremendous with some of the best gospel singers in the country providing the music- not to mention Meatloaf! Contrary to the critics, I found the ending mesmerizing- left open enough for interpretation, moving, and inspirational.So, ignore most of the critics, approach it with an open mind, and be willing to listen to the message.

The preview was incomplete with regard to giving me a sense of the film's direction, or at least the basic elements of the plot.Potential spoiler here:Well, I later saw the film and fell in love with it because it was not so much about slamming tent ""revivals"" as much as it was about a huckster being ""one upped"" by God. The irony was quite wonderful.So I do recommend this because Steve Martin puts in a great performance that is in line with his more creative schtick. He was a great choice to play the lead for this reason... he really fits the ""type"", at least what we perceive as the ""type"" who would become such a person as the character portrayed.",4,Good fun,1201564800,"01 29, 2008",2008,1212,"['had', 'unique', 'opportunity', 'review', 'scenes', 'film', 'year', 'was', 'released', 'was', 'mall', 'got', 'asked', 'wanted', 'participate', 'exercise', 'involving', 'film', 'desserts', 'chose', 'film', 'lead', 'room', 'explained', 'were', 'going', 'show', 'proposed', 'preview', 'upcoming', 'film', 'release', 'nothing', 'more.So', 'film', 'began', 'Leap', 'Faith', 'was', 'film.Afterward', 'asked', 'opinion', 'effectiveness', 'preview', 'told', 'needed', 'more', 'information', 'viewer', 'just', 'what', 'bloody', 'thing', 'was', 'about', 'preview', 'was', 'incomplete', 'regard', 'giving', 'sense', 'film', 'direction', 'least', 'basic', 'elements', 'plot.Potential', 'spoiler', 'here', 'Well', 'later', 'saw', 'film', 'fell', 'love', 'was', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'slamming', 'tent', 'revivals', 'as', 'much', 'was', 'huckster', 'being', 'one', 'upped', 'God', 'irony', 'was', 'quite', 'wonderful.So', 'do', 'recommend', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'great', 'performance', 'line', 'more', 'creative', 'schtick', 'was', 'great', 'choice', 'play', 'lead', 'reason', 'really', 'type', 'least', 'what', 'perceive', 'type', 'who', 'would', 'become', 'such', 'person', 'character', 'portrayed']",N/A

What's worse, it seems like it was clearly integrated to satisfy members of the ballooning religious right of the early 1990s who otherwise would have been expected to dismiss the film as another lefty-depiction of hollow American Christianity.Up until that point, though, Leap of Faith is a wonderfully complicated and human film about hard-working showmen making the best of a bad situation. Liars using their skills of deception to make bits of good happen in the world -- and loads of money fall into their pockets. Until those liars discover that, despite their best efforts, they've managed to tap into something true and create something absolutely real. That paradox is as old as time but rarely has it been explored with as much fun or honesty as this film. Again, until the unnecessary, cheap, and hoaky ending.Steve Martin gives one of his strongest performances here (though his in-revival stage dancing seems a bit too clownish, it's so much fun and he fills the scenes with such presence it's hard to take issue). Neeson doesn't have much to work with, and he seems to only half-heartedly embrace an American accent (sometimes he seems to drop it all together), but he's likable and he and Winger's chemistry is quite fun to watch.Meatloaf is underused but it's fun to see him on screen. The real joy for me, and why ultimately the film get's a 4/5 instead of a 3/5 despite the ending and Neeson's accent, is watching an early-20s Philip Seymour Hoffman, particularly in light of his late passing. He has a blast with his small role, and lights up the screen every time he's in frame. He also isn't given much to do here, and at the time the film was released it would probably have been easy to overlook.

It's understandable why Christian believers would not want any part of seeing this movie.... but than again, they should be the first to see it as it's premise is nothing new and in no way maligns or mocks their faith, rather, the film is a commentary about fake evangelists and faith-healers out for a buck.  The Gospels record such goings on in the first century when Jesus ran everybody out of the temple for turning it into ""a den of robbers"".  OK so the acts were different but the idea is the same: preying on those in need and on their vulnerabilities.  In the temple, it was people who came from all over to make sacrifices to atone for their sins, and with bogus evangelists and faith-healers it's their need for salvation and healing.Steve Martin does a wonderful job at pulling off the heartless con man who cares nothing about the people in a town that has fallen on hard times particularly because of an extended drought.  As I stated before, the movie is not jab at Christianity.  If anything, it defends it as it makes commentary not only on this bogus faith-healer but also how God - as He does in the pages of the Bible - can take any situation and use it to His Glory and to the benefit to those who believe.  In this movie a real miracle takes place that upstages the players.  Through the efforts of corrupt sinners preying on sinners looking for help, God is totally in control to bring a blessing and even make the preying one take note.  To quote Joseph ""What you meant for evil, God meant for good"".  All in all, we are all in the same boat - sinners needing salvation, not only from Hell but also from our own ways that cause us and others pain and suffering and what a way God chooses to bless humanity not only to allow Himself to become one of us via His Son Jesus but also through humanity itself regardless of the condition.The movie concludes wonderfully as we find our preacher man having repented and the town is once again blessed....

It is the blind leading the blind. The irony of it is that as much as the Church objects to Hollywood, it was Hollywood that made a movie pointing out what Christians refused to speak out on. Steve Martin watched hours and hours of tv evangelists before creating this film. He told his wife that these guys were better actors than anyone in Hollywood. The fact that the film features more than one answered prayer makes me think that God wanted this movie made.

Martin deserved an academy award for his brillant portrayal.  Great supporting performances by Debra Winger, Liam Neeson and Philip Seymour Hoffman in his first memorable role.The other star of this movie is the excellent score particularly near the end as the author shifts from the con to &quot;could this be real&quot;.  Not often is the score so prominent in manipulating thre viewer emotionally.  I'm agnostic but the story is so uplifting that you can't help but be touched.

So, if you have seen this film, think you know it, well, please give it a second chance in its new life.Okay, my understanding on the basis for this film, is that it was written after a very prominent preacher was  caught doing exactly what Jonas does. This preacher is STILL very prominent. Anyways, the best drama is often based in fact. And the elements that make this drama work are  all  here, including the ""Cold Reading"" of the Policeman who pulls over the Main Truck in the opening scenes. It takes quite a skill to do the kind of cold reading that ""Jonas"" does, but it's more of an illusionist sort of trick, and for the most part makes great theatre, and in part is what some good side-show  Psychics do to ""tell fortunes"".Where this parts company with the real life Con men who pretend to be men of god who  have a line to God, is that Jonas discovers a real miracle with the Young Lukas Haas. Jonas Knows he is a fake, and justifies his work as someone who entertains at rates cheaper than the Stages in New York... entertainment at a reasonable price. So Jonas discovers that there is a real version of what he is selling, and he makes a break for it, and his miracle is complete with  the last few events of the film.There is a lot to this film, and very worth a few watches. I am surprised no extras were included, but I guess if they showed up how the real major con-artists  work, then they may get ""sued"".
