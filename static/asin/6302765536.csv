There are some like ""American Pie"", ""American Wedding"", ""The Godfather Part II"" and ""National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation"", that are as great as the first ones, but then there are others like ""The Godfather Part III"", ""Wayne's World 2"" and ""Vegas Vacation"" that kill an entire series. ""Home Alone 2: Lost In New York"" straddles the field. It's nowhere near as good as the first one, but it's really a very good movie nonetheless.In it, Macaulay Culkin returns as Kevin. After two years of being treated kindly by his parents as an apology for leaving him home alone, he has become the alleged source of problems once again.The film is different in that Kevin actually isn't ""home alone"" so to speak. He makes it to the airport for the family's Florida vacation. However, it's the wrong plane he boards. Kevin winds up in New York. Nervous at first, he realizes he brought his dad's luggage with him, and buys his way through Manhattan with his credit card, including an ill fated stay at the plaza hotel. (I find it interesting since I too had an unpleasant stay at the plaza last year, when they lost my only luggage, which was filled with thousands of dollars worth of cds). However, Marv (Daniel Stern) and Harry (Joe Pesci) are back on the streets, also in New York, and soon run into Kevin. You can basically tell what happens in here.Overall, this film is very good. However, there is one reason this film doesn't get five stars or even four point five. That is because it does not have the warm holiday feeling the first one had. In fact, this film is darker than the first one. One good example is the confrontation at the abandoned house with Marv and Harry. It is much more violent than the first one. Marv is nearly killed when he gets electrocuted. How's that for a family film? Plus, there is one rather disturbing sequence where Kevin is nerrvous because he's alone in the dead of night and meets to really seedy and weird hookers. Then he gets into a cab with a really spooky driver. This may actually frighten the younger fans of the first film. Another sticking point is that I never got into Brenda Fricker's pigeon character (this film's version of the much more enjoyable shovel character from the first film).However, there are some strong qualities. Catherine O'Hara turns in another strong performance as Kevin's put - upon mother, while the small roles by Donald O'Connor, Tim Curry, Rob Schneider (still a cast member on ""Saturday Night Live"" at this point) and Donald Trump liven things up. This is nowhere near as good as part one, but definitely worth it.",4,"Not As Good As The First, But Not Dull By Any Means",1114905600,"05 1, 2005",2005,2709,"['Sequels', 'are', 'almost', 'never', 'as', 'good', 'first', 'one', 'only', 'one', 'better', 'first', 'one', 'Mission', 'Impossible', '2', 'are', 'American', 'Pie', 'American', 'Wedding', 'Godfather', 'Part', 'II', 'National', 'Lampoon', 'Christmas', 'Vacation', 'are', 'as', 'great', 'first', 'ones', 'then', 'are', 'others', 'Godfather', 'Part', 'III', 'Wayne', 'World', '2', 'Vegas', 'Vacation', 'kill', 'entire', 'series', 'Home', 'Alone', '2', 'Lost', 'New', 'York', 'field', 'nowhere', 'near', 'as', 'good', 'first', 'one', 'really', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'Macaulay', 'Culkin', 'Kevin', 'two', 'years', 'being', 'treated', 'kindly', 'parents', 'apology', 'leaving', 'home', 'alone', 'become', 'alleged', 'source', 'problems', 'once', 'again.The', 'film', 'different', 'Kevin', 'actually', ""n't"", 'home', 'alone', 'so', 'speak', 'airport', 'family', 'Florida', 'vacation', 'However', 'wrong', 'plane', 'Kevin', 'up', 'New', 'York', 'Nervous', 'first', 'brought', 'dad', 'luggage', 'way', 'Manhattan', 'credit', 'card', 'including', 'ill', 'fated', 'stay', 'plaza', 'hotel', 'find', 'interesting', 'too', 'had', 'unpleasant', 'stay', 'plaza', 'last', 'year', 'when', 'lost', 'only', 'luggage', 'was', 'filled', 'thousands', 'dollars', 'cds', 'However', 'Marv', 'Daniel', 'Stern', 'Harry', 'Joe', 'Pesci', 'are', 'back', 'streets', 'also', 'New', 'York', 'soon', 'run', 'Kevin', 'can', 'basically', 'tell', 'what', 'here.Overall', 'film', 'very', 'good', 'However', 'one', 'reason', 'film', ""n't"", 'get', 'five', 'stars', 'even', 'four', 'point', 'five', 'not', 'have', 'warm', 'holiday', 'feeling', 'first', 'one', 'had', 'fact', 'film', 'darker', 'first', 'one', 'One', 'good', 'example', 'confrontation', 'abandoned', 'house', 'Marv', 'Harry', 'much', 'more', 'violent', 'first', 'one', 'Marv', 'nearly', 'killed', 'when', 'electrocuted', 'How', 'family', 'film', 'one', 'rather', 'disturbing', 'sequence', 'where', 'Kevin', 'nerrvous', 'alone', 'dead', 'night', 'meets', 'really', 'seedy', 'weird', 'hookers', 'Then', 'cab', 'really', 'spooky', 'driver', 'may', 'actually', 'frighten', 'younger', 'fans', 'first', 'film', 'sticking', 'point', 'never', 'got', 'Brenda', 'Fricker', 'pigeon', 'character', 'film', 'version', 'much', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'shovel', 'character', 'first', 'film', '.However', 'are', 'strong', 'qualities', 'Catherine', ""O'Hara"", 'strong', 'performance', 'Kevin', 'put', 'mother', 'small', 'roles', 'Donald', ""O'Connor"", 'Tim', 'Curry', 'Rob', 'Schneider', 'still', 'cast', 'member', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Live', 'point', 'Donald', 'Trump', 'liven', 'things', 'up', 'nowhere', 'near', 'as', 'good', 'part', 'one', 'definitely']",N/A

333022,A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ,6302765536,"Barry ""Barrybgb""","[1, 1]","All kidding aside, this 1992 follow-up to the mega 1990 smash hit, is a delightful and fun little romp through the most magical of cities at Christmas time, New York City. While the nostalgia and set-up in the first film doesn't quite carry over into this one fully intact, it's a credible sequel to the first film. With the world getting into the holiday mood and sprit, I have been in the mood for reviewing some Christmas stuff. This time, young Kevin McAlister(Macaulay Culkin)and his family, and extended family, are planning a yuletide trip to Florida. In the usual mad cap dash to the destination, as in the first film, little Kevin is lost behind in the shuffle, and instead of joining his family on the plane to Florida, he boards the wrong plane and ends up in New York City. If this isn't too much of an stretched out plot ploy, then the fact that little Kevin, in the gigantic abyss that is New York, runs into the two bumblibg crooks from the first film, again played by Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern. What a coinkidink. The two survived their torture in the boobytrapped house, and have now escaped prison, and are looking for revenge. Quite convenient that Kevin is right there. Even though the film seems to be mostly a re-tread of the original, it makes glorious use of it's beautiful surroundings and new location, and manages to make it somewhat fresh, even if the material mostly isn't. The movie squeezes out some genuine laughs, but not high on the meter as the original. The cartoon violence is upped to another level, and some of it, like in the first, is quite clever and inventive. Almost too clever for a small boy. The cast, returning and new, all shine here, and really carry the film along. Culkin is sweet and charming, and he hasn't lost what he had in the original here. But in recent times, what happened?. Pesci and Stern are definitley game, and they are a hoot and a half to watch. Seeing little Pesci get beat down is always fun, and Stern's reaction to the pain and torture is still as funny as the original. John Heard and Catherine 'O' Hara get minimal time, again, but it is the great 'O' Hara that is the only one of the two who ends up getting something. New additions including the wonderful Tim Curry, a concierge at the famed hotel Kevin stays at. Funnyman Rob Schneider is the bell boy. Brenda Fricker is a friendly bird lady Kevin meets in Central Park, and vetern actor Eddie Bracken is the owner of a toy store. But seriously, wouldn't anyone be a little upset and worried that Kevin's mother has left him behind twice, and that he has always, in both times, ended up in mortal danger?. Jeez louise!. The first time, while still horrible to happen to anybody, can be seen as happening. But a second time?!. Didn't the first time teach not just her, but the rest of the family, to be more aware?. I guess not. Director Chris Columbus, returning from the first film, shoots the film elegantly, and makes the most out of the city. He really sets the tone for the holidays and the right Christmas spirit.

He mistakes a man with the same coat as his father and after Kevin reassures a flight attendant he's on the right plane, takes his seat ... in a plane heading in the exact opposite direction the rest of his family is going (naturally, no one realizes Kevin's missing until they're in Miami and he's in NY).Who could have thought a vacant New York brownstone could be so much fun?

333056,A1ZSOK69XSXF73,6302765536,"Duckman ""Morbid Cynic""","[2, 7]","Merry Christmas, everyone!!I saw this movie in theaters with my family back around Christmas of 1992, and being the easy-to-impress five year-old that I was, I loved the movie.  Like the first Home Alone movie, I would spend the rest of my childhood loving this movie without giving it much deep thought.  It wasn't until around two years ago that my fandom for this movie began to severely decline after applying good old logic to everything.STORYIt's Christmas time again, and the MacCallisters are headed off to Florida to visit their family during the Holidays.  Again, Kevin gets into a scuffle with Buzz, this time at a school play when Buzz humiliates him on stage and Kevin knocks him down, causing a domino effect of other small disasters.  Again, Kevin's family targets him and scolds him for it.  They wind up late for the flight again, but are more caution to see that Kevin is actually with them, but Kevin ends up getting lost at the airport and gets caught on a flight to New York City.  The Wet Bandits break out of prison and end up in NYC, and plan on robbing a giant toy store in the Big Apple.CHARACTERSThe characters in this movie make a total reversal in this sequel.  It's like Kevin's family forgot what they learned at the end of the first movie and reverted back to their old ways, and that the other characters in this movie feel far less believable in their actions.  Why would Kevin's family blame Kevin for causing the incident at the play when they saw in plain sight that Buzz caused it?  At this point, they're clearly being jerks against Kevin.Also, the supporting cast doesn't fare better.  The homeless lady is clearly a rehash of Marley Murphy from the first movie, and the staff controlling the Plaza Hotel (headed by Mr. Hector, played by Tim Curry) are too easily fooled into admitting Kevin into the hotel.This time, Marv and Harry seem more like generic comic foils than in the first movie, which totally works against the film's overall rating.FORMULAIC STRUCTUREI'm not joking, the plot structure for Home Alone 2 is exactly the same as the first one.  Just like with the first movie, Kevin gets into a predicament with his family, he gets lost from them, he encounters the Wet Bandits (who now call themselves the Sticky Bandits), he gets scared by a ""scary"" person who later becomes friends with, Kevin's family goes crazy to find him, Kevin sets up traps against Marv and Harry (this time, in his uncle's apartment under renovation), and I can keep going but I think I made my point clear.LACK OF LOGICWhile there were some logical fallacies in the first Home Alone, the lack of logic in this movie is beyond absurd.Kevin fools a Plaza Hotel receptionist into admitting him into the hotel through his Talkboy.  He first records himself and uses a voice distortion effect on the Talkboy to make his voice deep, but anyone with remotely decent hearing can know that the effect is clearly that, an effect.  In real life, the receptionist would have been on to something fishy and hung up.Also, Marv and Harry hide out in Duncan's Toy Chest in two giant toy houses in the store in order to rob it without setting off security alarms.  They hide in there for at least a day or two, and more likely than not, the workers and/or security staff at the store would have noticed the two hiding out.When Kevin gets lost in the more seedy parts of New York, he bumps into unsavory folks that look more like characters in a b-grade horror movie than a Home Alone movie.I can keep going, but I think these illustrate my point well enough.CONTINUITYTo be fair, some of the continuity in relation to the first one is decent and amusing in some parts.  The best parts of this have to be in relation to Marv and Harry recalling the past encounters with Kevin, such as when they grab him and Marv says to Harry ""This time he doesn't have a house full of dangerous goodies.""HUMORTo be fair, there are some parts of the movie that pack in some good laughs, thus why this movie has a long ways to go before becoming a total goose egg.  I still laugh like crazy in the scene where Marv and Harry are in the apartment under renovation, and Harry pulls on the bathroom light switch, only to have a torch light his head, followed by him screaming and dunking his head in a toilet bowl full of gasoline.  The same can be said with the scene where they think they outsmarted Kevin when they ascend the staircase and dodge the flying paint cans, only to be greeted by a giant pipe wacking both of them in the face and falling through a giant hole in the floor.Even outside of this phase of the movie, there's some funny parts, such as Kevin fooling Mr. Hector into thinking he's watching someone in the shower and uses a recording from Uncle Frank to scare him off, resulting in Mr. Hector running into a stool.You don't have to watch the whole movie just for these parts, as you can find most (if not all) of these funny parts on YouTube.CINEMATOGRAPHYThe cinematography of New York is quite pretty.  There's good shots of many landmark locations in the Big Apple, and it was pretty funny to see Kevin roam the city and see a man dressed as Santa walking on stilts to make him absurdly tall.SOUNDTRACKThe music in Home Alone 2 is largely the same as that in the first movie, though there's some different choices in ""traditional"" Christmas tunes.  Even though the music sounds nice, it doesn't save the movie from its devastating flaws.FINAL WORDPerhaps if you're a person who doesn't mind watching movies through a nostalgic lens, you won't mind this movie.  However, if you're a film fan who cares about logic and proper character development, then you won't gain much from watching Home Alone 2.Again, just save yourself a lot of time and go around YouTube for the funny parts of the movie.",1,A childhood favorite that has aged quite poorly.  25%,1356307200,"12 24, 2012",2012,5812,"['Merry', 'Christmas', 'everyone', 'saw', 'movie', 'theaters', 'family',

333062,A1FMJJKSVQDDQ,6302765536,Eric S. Kim,"[0, 0]","Home Alone 2: Lost in New York is mostly an exact duplicate of the original film. Kevin (Culkin) gets into trouble in the beginning, he ignores his family, his family is separated from him, he enjoys his independence, and his two most ruthless rivals come and ruin all the fun. But this time, Kevin makes it to the airport and gets on the wrong plane. So now he's in New York City for the holidays, while his family is all the way down in Florida. I'd say that Lost in New York is as equally entertaining as the first. It has the same amount of charm, and the booby traps are a bit more inventive. Tim Curry becomes a bit of a sensation in a small antagonistic role, while Rob Schneider is pretty annoying whenever he appears (isn't he always?). But the film as a whole is a bit more beautiful-looking, with a few darker elements added in. I don't think I can decide which film is better, since I think they are equally brilliant. So I will say that this is yet another Christmas classic that anyone can watch during the holiday season.

Home Alone 2 is a carbon copy, but it's also much better and more complex a movie than the first. In another mad rush to the airport the McCallisters make a point of remembering Kevin this time. But he gets lost in a crowd at the airport and follows a man who looks like his dad onto the wrong plane. Thirteen of the McCallisters are going to Miami for Xmas (do they never stay at home?) but Kevin is headed for the Big Apple. And he's going to have that once-in-a-lifetime vacation he's been wishing for.There's much more for Kevin to see and do in New York. He scams his way into the Plaza hotel where a suspicious Concierge (Tim Curry) gives him mighty evil looks at every encounter. He goes to Duncan's Toy Chest, the biggest toy store in town and takes many scenic photographs. Though it is a little worrying now seeing Kevin on the roof of the World Trade Centre.But the Wet Bandits have escaped, and they have just arrived in New York with loftier ambitions and bigger heists to pull off. They even brush by Kevin a few times not knowing he's there. Typically though, once they get a hold of him the give away far too much info. Once Kevin escapes he takes matters into his own hands once more. His Aunt Georgette from the first movie is still in Paris so he uses her half-renovated home as a huge mousetrap for the bungling burglars.The booby traps this time are much more painful and nasty, so it's all the more amusing for us. Who can possibly fail to laugh at Marv getting the shock of his life when he tries to turn on the taps? If the movie were to be released now I doubt if it would be let away with a PG rating. Still, it's nothing for any parents to worry about. Unless you fear your child is going to set your head on fire with a blowtorch.Home Alone 2 has a more satisfying climax than the first. The film doesn't simply end once Harry and Marv are back in the slammer as there is more plot to it than that. Brenda Fricker has a (rather questionable) role as 'The Pigeon Lady' a woman who lives in Central Park and talks to no one-until Kevin reaches out. Plus Eddie Bracken shows up as Mr. Duncan and gives Kevin the best Xmas morning ever as a token of his appreciation.With a bigger story (okay some of it re-used) and more characters and a better playground for Kevin, Home Alone 2 manages to be a superior sequel. While not excessively so. There's loads of fun to be had in Kevin's antics, and Tim Curry is downright brilliant as the mischievous Concierge.It's a great movie on it's own but sadly it will always be called a copycat. Watch it now from a fresh perspective and you might like it more.The 1.85:1 1080p Blu Ray is a huge improvement on the DVD, but fine object detail is still lacking in a few shots. It's a minor quibble though. The strange thing about the DTS HD-MA audio is that, like the DVD, you have to turn it way up in order to get decent sound.Once more the only extras are standard definition trailers for all three movies. Phew! The effort Fox must have put into this Blu Ray (one of the highest grossing movies ever) must have been backbreaking work.",5,"I knew it was you, I could SMELL ya gettin' off the elevata",1070496000,"12 4, 2003",2003,3201,"['Too', 'many', 'sequels', 'suffer', 'Deja', 'Vu', 'hardly', 'carbon', 'copies', 'improve', 'original', 'Home', 'Alone', '2', 'carbon', 'copy', 'also', 'much', 'better', 'more', 'complex', 'movie', 'first', 'mad', 'rush', 'airport', 'McCallisters', 'make', 'point', 'remembering', 'Kevin', 'time', 'lost', 'crowd', 'airport', 'man', 'who', 'dad', 'wrong', 'plane', 'Thirteen', 'McCallisters', 'are', 'going', 'Miami', 'Xmas', 'do', 'never', 'stay', 'home', 'Kevin', 'headed', 'Big', 'Apple', 'going', 'have', 'once-in-a-lifetime', 'vacation', 'been', 'wishing', 'for.There', 'much', 'more', 'Kevin', 'see', 'do', 'New', 'York', 'scams', 'way', 'Plaza', 'hotel', 'where', 'suspicious', 'Concierge', 'Tim', 'Curry', 'mighty', 'evil', 'looks', 'encounter', 'Duncan', 'Toy', 'Chest', 'biggest', 'toy', 'store', 'town', 'many', 'scenic', 'photographs', 'little', 'worrying', 'now', 'seeing', 'Kevin', 'roof', 'World', 'Trade', 'Centre.But', 'Wet', 'Bandits', 'have', 'escaped', 'have', 'just', 'arrived', 'New', 'York', 'loftier', 'ambitions', 'bigger', 'heists', 'pull', 'off', 'even', 'brush', 'Kevin', 'few', 'times', 'not', 'knowing', 'there', 'Typically', 'once', 'get', 'hold', 'give', 'away', 'far', 'too', 'much', 'info', 'Once', 'Kevin', 'matters', 'own', 'hands', 'once', 'more', 'Aunt', 'Georgette', 'first', 'movie', 'still', 'Paris', 'half-renovated', 'home', 'huge', 'mousetrap', 'bungling', 'burglars.The', 'booby', 'time', 'are', 'much', 'more', 'painful', 'nasty', 'more', 'amusing', 'Who', 'can', 'possibly', 'fail', 'laugh', 'Marv', 'getting', 'shock', 'life', 'when', 'turn', 'taps', 'movie', 'were', 'be', 'released', 'now', 'doubt', 'would', 'be', 'let', 'away', 'PG', 'rating', 'Still', 'nothing', 'parents', 'worry', 'about', 'fear', 'child', 'going', 'set', 'head', 'fire', 'blowtorch.Home', 'Alone', '2', 'more', 'satisfying', 'climax', 'first', 'film', ""n't"", 'simply', 'end', 'once', 'Harry', 'Marv', 'are', 'back', 'slammer', 'more', 'plot', 'Brenda', 'Fricker', 'rather', 'questionable', 'role', ""'The"", 'Pigeon', 'Lady', 'woman', 'who', 'Central', 'Park', 'talks', 'one-until', 'Kevin', 'out', 'Eddie', 'Bracken', 'up', 'Mr.', 'Duncan', 'Kevin', 'best', 'Xmas', 'morning', 'ever', 'token', 'appreciation.With', 'bigger', 'story', 're-used', 'more', 'characters', 'better', 'playground', 'Kevin', 'Home', 'Alone', '2', 'manages', 'be', 'superior', 'sequel', 'not', 'excessively', 'so', 'loads', 'fun', 'be', 'had', 'Kevin', 'antics', 'Tim', 'Curry', 'downright', 'brilliant', 'mischievous', 'Concierge.It', 'great', 'movie', 'own', 'sadly', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'called', 'copycat', 'Watch', 'now', 'fresh', 'perspective', 'might', 'like', 'more.The', '1.85:1', '1080p', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'huge', 'improvement', 'DVD', 'fine', 'object', 'detail', 'still', 'lacking', 'few', 'shots', 'minor', 'quibble', 'strange', 'thing', 'DTS', 'HD-MA', 'audio', 'DVD', 'have', 'turn', 'way', 'up', 'order', 'get', 'decent', 'sound.Once', 'more', 'only', 'extras', 'are', 'standard', 'definition', 'trailers', 'three', 'movies', 'Phew', 'effort', 'Fox', 'must', 'have', 'put', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'one', 'highest', 'grossing', 'movies', 'ever', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'backbreaking', 'work']",N/A

There's scene selection, captioning, and trailers for ""Home Alone 1, 2, and 3"". The picture and sound are very crisp. Even though ""Home Alone 2"" was filmed within a couple of years of the original, I'm impressed that virtually the entire cast is back! Macaulay Culkin as Kevin leads the way, and shows once again that he's one of the screens's top comedic actors. I need to send special kudos to ""newcomers"" to Kevin's capers Tim Curry and Rob Schneider. They add lots of zip to the hotel world of Kevin. Especially Schneider in his understated comedic support brilliance. So often in other roles on-screen he's bringing the low brow  dash of poor taste. He's SO much better here, as a nice guy, an everyman. Great job! Leaving no stone unturned,  John Hughes and company even employed six ""pigeon wranglers""! Watch for their names in the rolling credits at film's end. Oh; and the family home from the original ""Home Alone"" is back, too. I don't know about Buzz' tarantula.

They are so confident that his life will end soon that they share their plans with him to rob a toy store as they're marching him toward the water. Funny... huh? The lads clever pranks cause serious head trauma, nails being driven into skulls and third degree burns. The parents in the movie go beyond being scatter brained and move straight into child neglect.

Bernabo,"[2, 5]","There are some differences between the plots of &quot;Home Alone&quot; and &quot;Home Along 2: Lost in New York.&quot;  Instead of going to his family going to France for Christmas they are going for Florida, instead of the family leaving them behind Kevin (Macaulay Culkin) gets on the wrong plane, instead of an old guy next door he befriends an old lady in the park, and instead of taking place in a Chicago suburban home it takes place mainly in a swank New York hotel.  Of course, all these changes are ultimately immaterial because John Hughes is sticking close to the original formula for his smash 1990 release for this 1992 sequel, even if Chris Columbus gets the joy of directing.The same three elements that worked so successfully with the original are present again.  First, Kevin gets to enjoy the highlife without his parents, enjoying the power of his father's credit card.  Second, Kevin once again gets to take down the Wet Bandits (Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern), when their paths get crossed again.  Third, there are the poignant moments with the kindly older folk that Kevin runs into, and his mother (Catharine O'Hara) has a lot more to do this time around in her frantic efforts to get to New York and look for her son.

Only this time, he's home alone....in New York City! Apparently, by some confusion at the airport Kevin boards the wrong plane, and instead of going to Miami with his family, he finds himself alone in New York.Now, a normal 10 year old boy would be scared, and explain to the adults working at the airport that he's borded the wrong plane, and become seperated from his family. However, Kevin is no ordinary boy, especially since he's got his Dad's personal travel bag with his Credit cards and money! To make the situation more interesting, the Wet bandits from the first Home Alone movie (Marv and Hary) have escaped from prison, and they are hiding from the police in.......New York city.Once you see both of these factors come into play in the movie, you know it's only a matter of time before Kevin crosses paths with Marv, and Harry. When it does, the fun and excitement commences!I agree with the other reviews that stated this movie has a bit much violence and might not be suitable for the really young audience. I believe I was 10 years old when this movie first came out, but I never seen it at the theatre. My mother rented it, so I was probably 11 whenever I first saw the movie.Some good things to look for in this movie is the scenes where Kevin is running around New York. Time square, Rockerfeller center, the Plaza Hotel are just a few. The camera shots and angles of certain parts of New York were beautiful, and of course, there is one scene I'm sure that will at least ""touch"" everyone in some way. I'm talking about the scene where Kevin approaches the Twin Towers, and is left amazed at their size in person. Even better is the next scene where Kevin is on top of the twin towers, and is taking pictures of the view over New York city.",4,"Good, but not as good as the first one.....",1196812800,"12 5, 2007",2007,1951,"['Home', 'Alone', 'movies', 'are', 'probably', 'forever', 'will', 'be', 'Christmas', 'Classics', 'plot', 'Home', 'Alone', '2', 'Kevin', 'Maculay', 'Culkin', 'becomes', 'seperated', 'family', 'Christmas', 'time', 'one', 'again', 'Only', 'time', 'home', 'alone', '.in', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'Apparently', 'confusion', 'airport', 'Kevin', 'wrong', 'plane', 'instead', 'going', 'Miami', 'family', 'alone', 'New', 'York.Now', 'normal', '10', 'year', 'old', 'boy', 'would', 'be', 'scared', 'explain', 'adults', 'working', 'airport', 'borded', 'wrong', 'plane', 'become', 'seperated', 'family', 'However', 'Kevin', 'ordinary', 'boy', 'especially', 'got', 'Dad', 'personal', 'travel', 'bag', 'Credit', 'cards', 'money', 'make', 'situation', 'more', 'interesting', 'Wet', 'bandits', 'first', 'Home', 'Alone', 'movie', 'Marv', 'Hary', 'have', 'escaped', 'prison', 'are', 'hiding', 'police', '.New', 'York', 'city.Once', 'see', 'factors', 'come', 'play', 'movie', 'know', 'only', 'matter', 'time', 'Kevin', 'paths', 'Marv', 'Harry', 'When', 'fun', 'excitement', 'commences', 'agree', 'other', 'reviews', 'stated', 'movie', 'bit', 'much', 'violence', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'suitable', 'really', 'young', 'audience', 'believe', 'was', '10', 'years', 'old', 'when', 'movie', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'never', 'seen', 'theatre', 'mother', 'rented', 'was', 'probably', '11', 'whenever', 'first', 'saw', 'movie.Some', 'good', 'things', 'look', 'movie', 'scenes', 'where', 'Kevin', 'running', 'around', 'New', 'York', 'Time', 'square', 'Rockerfeller', 'center', 'Plaza', 'Hotel', 'are', 'just', 'few', 'camera', 'shots', 'angles', 'certain', 'parts', 'New', 'York', 'were', 'beautiful', 'course', 'one', 'scene', ""'m"", 'sure', 'will', 'least', 'touch', 'everyone', 'way', ""'m"", 'talking', 'scene', 'where', 'Kevin', 'Twin', 'Towers', 'left', 'amazed', 'size', 'person', 'Even', 'better', 'next', 'scene', 'where', 'Kevin', 'top', 'twin', 'towers', 'taking', 'pictures', 'view', 'New', 'York', 'city']",N/A

He's alone again, if one can ever be alone in New York City, but he's not at home, so the title no longer makes sense.Once you realize you're basically watching Home Alone again; different details with the same basic plotline; you start to anticipate the one entertaining part; the part where The Wet Bandits, now known as The Sticky Bandits, fall victim to Kevin and his booby traps.

You know Kevin's going to get lost, you know he's going to enjoy the excitement of being alone, but then misses his mum (big awwwwwwww everyone!), and you know the mum's going to find him in the end.What I didn't expect was Harry &amp; Marv (Joe Pesci and the other guy) to not appear as much as the previous film. They appeared very rarely, and only came properly into the film later on. But they were as great as ever. Although's there's only so many times you can watch a guy get hit in the crotch, and still find it funny - but I cross my legs everytime, and I'm female! There were some funny bits when Kevin was throwing everything he could lay his hands on at them - the funniest I found was Marv getting covered in dust and then sneezing!The fabulous Brenda Fricker plays a great role in this as the Bird Lady, who originally scares Kevin, but then they become friends. It's a small role, but she's suited to it - and she scared me too! :(And of course, who could forget the brilliant Tim Curry? He pops up a lot in films, and I never seem to tire of him - except when he's in the bad guy role. He was brilliant in this, and so overly camp - can I please have a tape measure to see how high that hair is? The bit where Kevin's mum slapped him was classic - especially when he looked like he was going to cry.You've got all the old characters from the previous film, who thankfully, don't get too much focus in the film - they really annoy me. But I suppose that's the point really.Another great Christmas movie, with a sad ending, but the directors really should have known when to end - stop while they were ahead, and the formula doesn't become old and tired.

333132,A1RZ1KIP4LJYDZ,6302765536,"moviefreak ""moviefreak2003""","[0, 0]","After Home Alone's success, writer John Hughes (Uncle Buck) and director Chris Columbus (Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone) joined together once again to make the average sequel Home Alone 2: Lost In New York, which lived up to expectations though didn't match the wit and fun of the original. Though rumors stated that Macaulay Culkin, the ""child"" star of the first two Home Alones was getting too old to reprise his role, I believe Home Alone 3 changed characters because the audience was getting tired of the same old routine of seeing Culkin outsmart and defeat a group of idiots. I believe the audience wanted something new, which is also why I think they replaced the Wet Bandits with the other four villains as well as Chris Columbus as director. Though armed with a better script, Home Alone 2: Lost in New York does not succeed in being as perfect as the original because you'll keep asking yourself the same question throughout the movie: Haven't we seen this before?In the sequel, Macaulay Culkin reprises his role as Kevin McAllister, the young boy who beat up two criminals and sent them to jail two years ago. The McCallisters are planning another trip and oh-this-is-unexpected, Kevin once again gets separated from his family. After misleadingly following a man that looked like his father onboard a plane, Kevin finds himself in New York City with his father's cash and credit cards. At the same time, the Wet Bandits who ae the two criminals Kevin put to jail two years ago (Joe Pesci, Goodfellas, and Daniel Stern, Bushwhacked) escape from jail. Kevin once again meets up with them (oh, what a coincidence) and once again it's up to him to stop them before they commit a gigantic toy store robbery. Armed with dozens of booby traps and weapons, Kevin forms a war zone in his uncle's big mansion and wages World War III against the robbers. Let's see, can you figure out who will win this time?Once again, the movie is way too predictable and many of my Home Alone thoughs are similar of those of Home Alone 2's (Check the bottom portion of my Home Alone review) Though surrounded with an okay cast, Home Alone 2 once again succeeds in entertaining and being a completely thoughtless and childless film.Movie: Home Alone 2: Lost in New YorkActors/Actresses - Macaulay Culkin, Daniel Stern, Joe Pesci, Catherine O'Hara, John Hears, Tim Curry, Rob SchneiderDirector: Chris ColumbusTime: 120 minutesRated PG for childish violence and mild language",3,Almost as good as the first one though way too long,1030579200,"08 29, 2002",2002,2466,"['Home', 'Alone', 'success', 'writer', 'John', 'Hughes', 'Uncle', 'Buck', 'director', 'Chris', 'Columbus', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'Sorcerer', 'Stone', 'joined', 'together', 'once', 'again', 'make', 'average', 'sequel', 'Home', 'Alone', '2', 'Lost', 'New', 'York', 'lived', 'up', 'expectations', 'did', ""n't"", 'match', 'wit', 'fun', 'original', 'rumors', 'stated', 'Macaulay', 'Culkin', 'child', 'star', 'first', 'two', 'Home', 'Alones', 'was', 'getting', 'too', 'old', 'reprise', 'role', 'believe', 'Home', 'Alone', '3', 'changed', 'characters', 'audience', 'was', 'getting', 'tired', 'same', 'old', 'routine', 'seeing', 'Culkin', 'outsmart', 'defeat', 'group', 'idiots', 'believe', 'audience', 'wanted', 'something', 'new', 'also', 'why', 'think', 'replaced', 'Wet', 'Bandits', 'other', 'four', 'villains', 'as', 'well', 'Chris', 'Columbus', 'director', 'armed', 'better', 'script', 'Home', 'Alone', '2', 'Lost', 'New', 'York', 'not', 'succeed', 'being', 'as', 'perfect', 'original', ""'ll"", 'keep', 'asking', 'same', 'question', 'movie', 'Have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'sequel', 'Macaulay', 'Culkin', 'role', 'Kevin', 'McAllister', 'young', 'boy', 'who', 'beat', 'up', 'two', 'criminals', 'sent', 'jail', 'two', 'years', 'ago', 'McCallisters', 'are', 'planning', 'trip', 'oh-this-is-unexpected', 'Kevin', 'once', 'again', 'separated', 'family', 'misleadingly', 'following', 'man', 'looked', 'father', 'plane', 'Kevin', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'father', 'cash', 'credit', 'cards', 'same', 'time', 'Wet', 'Bandits', 'who', 'ae', 'two', 'criminals', 'Kevin', 'put', 'jail', 'two', 'years', 'ago', 'Joe', 'Pesci', 'Goodfellas', 'Daniel', 'Stern', 'Bushwhacked', 'escape', 'jail', 'Kevin', 'once', 'again', 'up', 'oh', 'what', 'coincidence', 'once', 'again', 'up', 'stop', 'commit', 'gigantic', 'toy', 'store', 'robbery', 'Armed', 'dozens', 'booby', 'traps', 'weapons', 'Kevin', 'war', 'zone', 'uncle', 'big', 'mansion', 'wages', 'World', 'War', 'III', 'robbers', 'Let', 'see', 'can', 'figure', 'out', 'who', 'will', 'win', 'time', 'Once', 'again', 'movie', 'way', 'too', 'predictable', 'many', 'Home', 'Alone', 'thoughs', 'are', 'similar', 'Home', 'Alone', '2', 'Check', 'bottom', 'portion', 'Home', 'Alone', 'review', 'surrounded', 'okay', 'cast', 'Home', 'Alone', '2', 'once', 'again', 'entertaining', 'being', 'completely', 'thoughtless', 'childless', 'film.Movie', 'Home', 'Alone', '2', 'Lost', 'New', 'YorkActors/Actresses', 'Macaulay', 'Culkin', 'Daniel', 'Stern', 'Joe', 'Pesci', 'Catherine', ""O'Hara"", 'John', 'Hears', 'Tim', 'Curry', 'Rob', 'SchneiderDirector', 'Chris', 'ColumbusTime', '120', 'minutesRated', 'PG', 'childish', 'violence', 'mild', 'language']",N/A

There are many similarities to the first movie.  The same two burglars are involved trying to rob a toy store, Kevin works to out smart them, and then there is the mysterious character that Kevin is at first scared of and then becomes friends with (In the first movie it was the man with the shovel and in this one it is the lady who feeds the penguins).  Some of the humor is a little more exaggerated than the first one such as when the parents awake out of bed to find they are late they run to the end of their bed and scream.  Secondly, the traps for the criminals were not as realistic, as a normal human being would not be able to survive many of these traps.  Third, there is a little mistake, in the first Home Alone Kevin was 8, in this one he says he is 10, however, the mother refers to the last incident (what we see in the first one) as happening ""last year.""  This doesn't take away from the humor in the movie; it's just funny to catch these things.  Of course, this movie is made better with the acting of Tim Curry.  I just about died laughing when he gets down on his knees and says ""I love you"" due to one of Kevin's tricks.  The meaning of this movie is pretty much the same as the first movie in that we should not take our family for granted.  It also shows that our initial prejudices may be wrong as Kevin befriends a woman that he was afraid of.  Home Alone 2 is good for those who are looking for humor and meaning and a movie to sit down and watch as a family.

333151,A1G2TISMTB8JT1,6302765536,Quigley,"[1, 2]","Home Alone is one of my favorite movies; the music was good, it was funny, the acting was great, and the booby traps were a hit. Now, I don't mean to sound harsh, but a sequel wasn't necessary. The plot is filled with so many fake plot twists and things that would never happen, but they do. Macaulay Culkin wasn't as good this time, but he could still act well. Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern were hilarious as the Sticky Bandits, their name changed this time. But when the expected booby trap sequence begins, it had stuff in it that could have made the movie PG-13 rated. I mean, shoud parents really let their kids see a sadistic kid throwing bricks at the burglar's heads from the 3-story rooftops? I was honestly a little sickened by this sequence, but there were some traps thatwere pretty funny (the cement bag was a kick). In the first film, the guys could have possibly lived, but in this one they survive things only a cartoon would. It's funny, yes, but sometimes upsetting (for example, the sink and the staples). I still think it's an easily watchable film for people wanting a mindless movie to unwind with after a hard day when you don't want to do any thinking.

333155,A1J2931UBBJPXM,6302765536,Reviewer,"[8, 13]","Since the early 80s, writer/producer (and sometime director) John Hughes has had his finger on the pulse of contemporary America.  Responsible for such films as ""The Breakfast Club,"" the wildly successful National Lampoon ""Vacation"" series (including ""Christmas Vacation,"" which to many has become a holiday staple, right up there with ""A Christmas Carol"" and ""It's A Wonderful Life"") and another favorite around Thanksgiving time, ""Planes, Trains and Automobiles,"" he nevertheless achieved his greatest commercial success when he came up with the idea of having a little boy getting inadvertently left behind when his family goes off for a Christmas vacation to Paris.  That, of course, was ""Home Alone.""  But he didn't stop there.  Some two years later that same little boy boards the wrong plane and ends up in New York City while his parents and the rest of his family go to Florida, in ""Home Alone 2-- Lost In New York,"" directed by Chris Columbus.Once again the extended McCallister family is off for the Christmas holidays, and this time Kevin (Macaulay Culkin) winds up alone in New York.  Luckily for him, however, he somehow manages to end up with his father's carry-on, which just happens to contain a credit card.  And by using the kind of ingenuity that would escape most adults, he successfully checks himself into the Plaza Hotel under his dad's name, whereupon he soon discovers room service.  He also discovers Duncan's Toy Store (to which he is transported in style via the Plaza's limo, complete with cheese pizza just for him), a pigeon lady (Brenda Fricker) in Central Park, and some old acquaintances from back home, Marv (Daniel Stern) and Harry (Joe Pesci), the ""Wet Bandits"" themselves, though now known (since breaking out of prison) as the ""Sticky Bandits.""  Meanwhile, mom and dad (Catherine O'Hara and John Heard) are frantic in Florida when they arrive and realize that Kevin is once again gone missing.  And with that, the search is on.  Meanwhile, back in New York--Opting to ride the ""Home Alone"" series out as writer/producer, Hughes placed the project in capable hands with director Columbus (who also directed the original ""Home Alone,"" and more recently the hugely successful ""Harry Potter).  This one may not have been a stretch for him artistically, especially since the characters had been previously established in the first one, but comedy of any kind can be touchy, as it is such a purely subjective arena, and Columbus does a good job of keeping the story on track (for the most part) and moving it right along.  Wisely, the filmmakers chose to proceed on the assumption that everyone had seen ""Home Alone,"" and therefore waste little time setting things up.  Instead, they contrive to get Kevin posthaste to New York -- where the story really begins-- and even if you haven't seen the first one this will work for you, because this, as they say, isn't brain surgery.Even so, it's a fairly uneven film.  There's a few laughs in the rush and flurry of getting Kevin to the Big Apple, but at that point Culkin is expected to carry the film, and quite frankly, left alone (no pun intended) it's a task for which he is simply not qualified.  He was veritably propelled to stardom when he played Kevin the first time around, but now-- two years later and two years older-- whatever ""cuteness"" or magic he may have had then is already noticeably starting to fade.  All that aside, however, the truth of the matter is he's just not that capable as an actor, paling in comparison to Haley Joel Osment or ""Potter's"" Daniel Radcliffe.  Culkin's timing is poor and his reactions lack the spontaneity that would have made Kevin a bit more believable.  His whole presentation of the character just seems too forced; and the attitude he conveys is more caustic than cute, which certainly detracts from his credibility, as well.Oscar winner (for ""My Left Foot"") Brenda Fricker has a dismally thankless role as the ""Pigeon Lady"" who connects with Kevin in the park.  With her character, Hughes and Columbus are obviously attempting to recapture the poignancy of the Culkin/Roberts Blossom ""church"" scene in the original (which worked very well); but Fricker's heavy-handed dramatics, combined with Culkin's aloof response to her, is almost too embarrassing to watch.  And the sight of Fricker standing statue-like in the park while pigeons come to roost on her head and shoulders is neither comical nor touching, but ridiculous.  In Fricker's defense, it wasn't entirely her fault; she was simply given material that didn't work and a part that was a no-win situation from the beginning.The only thing that really saves this picture at all is, without question, the slapstick antics of Marv and Harry.  When they at last engage in battle with Kevin (and you know it's coming), it's more violent than the Road Runner cartoons it emulates, but manages to produce some out-and-out, over-the-top, bona fide belly laughs.  Because-- forget everything else-- these two guys are dumber than a sackful of hammers, and Columbus successfully milks it for all it's worth and then some.  A warning to kids, though:  These buffoons are professionals; do not try this stuff at home.The supporting cast includes Tim Curry (Concierge), Dana Ivey (Mrs. Stone), Rob Schneider (Cedrick), Devin Ratray (Buzz), Ralph Foody (Gangster Johnny), Kieran Culkin (Fuller), Eddie Bracken (Mr. Duncan) and Gerry Bamman (Uncle Frank).  Culkin may be the ""star"" of this show, but without the talent they surround him with, ""Home Alone 2-- Lost In New York"" would've had to be retitled ""Lost at the Video Store,"" with a shelf life of about two minutes before disappearing altogether.  As it is, thanks to some cunning maneuvers by the filmmakers, this one at least provides some passable entertainment and a few good laughs.  For a satisfying evening at the movies you could certainly do worse than this; but you could do much better, too.",3,When the &quot;Cuteness&quot; Fades...,1007856000,"12 9, 2001",2001,5934,"['early',

American Airlines must have made a hefty bundle from all of the times the company logo was shown in this film, and I know I really wanted a Talk Boy when I was a kid.This is a good movie for kids and adults who were kids when the movie came out, but you might find yourself groaning about how predictable the plot is.",3,"""Home Alone"" With a 2 on the End",1229644800,"12 19, 2008",2008,1585,"['Did', 'love', 'Home', 'Alone', 'so', 'much', 'wished', 'could', 'watch', 'again', 'only', 'time', 'New', 'York', 'Well', 'got', 'wish', 'friend', 'movie', 'almost', 'carbon', 'copy', 'original', 'different', 'setting', 'right', 'down', 'Catherine', ""O'Hara"", 'screaming', 'Kevin', 'family', 'Florida', 'Christmas', 'vacation', 'airport', 'Kevin', 'Macaulay', 'Culkin', 'accidentally', 'man', 'father', 'plane', 'headed', 'New', 'York', 'When', 'out', 'made', 'blunder', ""n't"", 'scared', 'sights', 'including', 'World', 'Trade', 'Center', 'Plaza', 'Hotel', 'A', 'goofy', 'bellboy', 'Rob', 'Schneider', 'suspicious', 'clerk', 'Tim', 'Curry', 'give', 'trouble', 'Kevin', 'trouble', 'tricking', 'few', 'clips', 'Angels', 'Even', 'Dirtier', 'Faces', 'kindly', 'toy', 'shop', 'owner', 'Eddie', 'Bracken', 'distressed', 'find', 'old', 'Wet', 'Bandits', 'Joe', 'Pesci', 'Daniel', 'Stern', 'have', 'busted', 'prison', 'plan', 'rob', 'toy', 'store.The', 'big', 'fight', 'robbers', 'end', 'film', ""n't"", 'done', 'quite', 'same', 'way', 'first', 'film', 'far', 'too', 'many', 'bang', 'wham', 'be', 'anything', 'childish', 'low', 'quality', 'sequels', 'follow.And', 'notice', 'great', 'product', 'placement', 'American', 'Airlines', 'must', 'have', 'made', 'hefty', 'bundle', 'times', 'company', 'logo', 'was', 'shown', 'film', 'know', 'really', 'wanted', 'Talk', 'Boy', 'when', 'was', 'kid.This', 'good', 'movie', 'kids', 'adults', 'who', 'were', 'kids', 'when', 'movie', 'came', 'out', 'might', 'find', 'groaning', 'how', 'predictable', 'plot']",N/A
333162,AD29KEJMCAD76,6302765536,Samhot,"[21, 27]","Last time around, Kevin (Macaulay Culkin) was left home alone (pun intended) by his family in a frantic hurry to get to the airport. And to add insult to injury, he had to deal with a couple of bumbling sillies--burglars who wanted to burglarize his house--who went by the name of the ""Wet Bandits."" This time around, it's more of the same, but with a slight difference: this time, he gets on the wrong plane, and is left to his own devices in the ""Big Apple""--a/k/a New York City.The plot is pretty similar to the last one in many ways: Kevin gets into trouble due to getting into it with his older brother, and is punished. He gets fed up with his family treating him unfairly, and in the midst of his angst, wishes that he could have a vacation on his own, without any of his family. The next morning, in a frantic hurry, the family rushes to the airport to go to Florida for Christmas vacation. In the airport, Kevin stops to put some batteries into his small camcorder (which will be largely significant later in the film), and as soon as he lifts his head, his family are long gone. He spots an older guy from the backside who looks like his dad, and therefore gets on the same plane as this gentleman, believing that it really was his dad. Needless to say, he was in for a big surprise when the plane landed.Meanwhile, the ""Wet Bandits"" (Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern) escape from jail, and are in the ""Big Apple"" as well. You know what happens: they cross paths, and these two clowns are looking for revenge. The slapstick craziness that was seen in the last film, is taken up an extra notch, and is made gut-bustingly funnier as a result. (And again, just listening to Daniel Stern's demented operatic-like screeching as he gets his, alone, just slams the wind straight out of me. It's too hilarious!)As for poignant moments, last time around, the ""scary"" character was an old man who was rumored to be a murderer. This time, it's a homeless woman who dwells in Central Park, and her companions are a bunch of pigeons.These Home Alone films are recommended for anyone with a taste for over-the-top, outrageous slapstick humor, added with a large dose of mischief.

This Christmas sequel is as just as good as the first one. Kevin is back in action against The Wet Bandits: Marv (Stern) and Harry (Pesci). Let's see what tricks and schemes Kevin has up his sleeve this time.Once again, the movie starts out at the McCallister home and his family is running around back and forth getting ready for their Christmas trip to Florida. Kevin's father Peter (Heard) accidently unplugs the alarm clock and forgets to reset it! The next morning they sleep in AGAIN!

When Kevin is walking the streets, Harry and Marv see him and they seek revenge. Also while Kevin is temporarily abducetd by them, Marv reveals their plans to rob Dunkin's Toy Chest at midnight on Christmas Eve becuase of the idiot he is. Now that Kevin's escapes from them he realizes he has to go back into action against them and stop the robbery. Luckily Kevin's Uncle Rob has a apartment in New York that their renovating. Since no one is home, he uses the apartment as the battle grounds. He rigs the entire house full of gadgets. It's midnight! Kevin sees Marv and Harry inside the store robbing the place. Kevin throws a brick through the window to make the alarm go off. Marv and Harry is furious. &quot;LET'S GET HIM!&quot;Back to the apartment. Kevin is taking out the Wet Bandits with his gadgets.

333177,AKP40TIE5SVSQ,6302765536,Some Gravity,"[1, 1]","The movie industry has welcomed both good and poor sequels to movies,and when it comes down to good movie sequels,one of the best movie sequels (especially for a Christmas movie)happens to be,by far,the follow-up to the first ""Home Alone"" film:""Home Alone 2:Lost in New York"". While this film may not be as good as the first ""Home Alone"",its smart story and script make it one of the few worthy Christmas movie sequels out there,and a good film on its own.Here,Macaulay Culkin reprises his role as Kevin McCallister. And,this time around,while Kevin still may not be the most popular member of his large family,things are better for him. This is due to his family making an effort to be nicer to Kevin,something that they were motivated to do with the crisis that they faced in the first ""Home Alone"" film,along with the whole family flying down to Florida for Christmas (in this film).However,this one accomplishment by the McCallister family for Kevin is suddenly ruined the morning the McCallister family goes to the airport to fly to Florida. While Kevin is with them,a large misunderstanding by Kevin results in Kevin boarding a plane to New York City,while the rest of his family get on the right flight to Florida.Then,when Kevin realizes he is in New York City,despite the fact that his parents,Peter McCallister (John Heard)and Kate McCallister (Catherine O'Hara)find themselves once more frantically searching for Kevin with the aid of the rest of the family,Kevin decides to take advantage of being alone once more--and even manages to check into NYC's Plaza Hotel,giving himself an even better vacation than he would get if he did get on the right plane to Florida.But,Kevin's perfect vacation goes from good to worse,with the hotel concierge,Mr. Hector (Tim Curry,who is hillarious in his part)discovers that not only is the credit card Kevin used to check into the hotel not Kevin's credit card,but when Kevin is spotted by the two bumbling and unintelligent burglars whom he faced off in the first ""Home Alone"" film,Harry (Joe Pesci)and Marv (Daniel Stern). Kevin is able to escape from both Harry and Marv and has the opportunity to remain safe--but upon discovering a plan that Harry and Marv have to rob a large NYC toy store, Duncan's Toy Chest,Kevin pulls back into action with more surprises and booby traps for Harry and Marv--which leads into more humor and surprises,into this movie's very end.The major thing to question about ""Home Alone 2:Lost in New York"" (besides its so-called violence,which is childish,but good,black humor that works well for this movie,and is nothing to worry about with children)is the script. While the script for this film is a well-written script that accompanies a well-written story for this film,it sort of ""borrows"" from the first ""Home Alone"" film. In a way,""Home Alone 2:Lost in New York"" is sort of the first ""Home Alone"" revised,with a lot of events in this film that are similiar to several of the events in the first ""Home Alone"" film occuring here. However,despite all of that,this film is still funny in its own way with not only great acting and humor (especially from Tim Curry and Rob Schneider),but good,essential family values and lessons at the same time,as well. Overall,while you will want to watch the first ""Home Alone"" film before you watch this film,this is a good movie sequel and one of the best Christmas films that has ever been made.

333178,A3DY46ZABF4CMQ,6302765536,"S. Sarhan ""matured reviewer""","[0, 0]","Macaulay Culkin rose to fame as Kevin McCallister in 1990's blockbuster comedy Home Alone.2 years later, and with an 8 million dollar salary, the highest amount ever offered to a child actor, Culkin returned to the big screen after the mild success of 1991's My Girl in a sequel to his starmaking hit.Home Alone 2: Lost In New York is another hilarious movie produced and written by John Hughes (The Breakfast Club), and directed by Chris Columbus (Mrs. Doubtfire). Returning for the sequel are Joe Pesci (Goodfellas) and Daniel Stern (City Slickers) as dumb burglars Harry and Marvin, John Heard (187) and Catherine O'Hara (Beetlejuice) as Kevin's parents, the McCallisters, and the entire McCallister family. On board this time around is a hilarious cast including Tim Curry (Oscar), and Rob Schneider (Demolition Man).Exactly a year has passed since the fateful winter, and the McCallister family again rush to the airport, this time to catch a flight to Florida. Kevin lags behind and accidentally takes the flight to New York, hence the title. It turns out that the 'wet bandits' Harry and Marvin have escaped from prison from Illinois and made to the city that never sleeps. The two theives set a plan to rob a local toy store called Duncan's Toy Chest that Kevin find interest in because the store's manager donates all of the money he gets on the holiday to the children's hospital. In the meantime, Kevin tours the city and checks himself into New York's finest hotel, The Plaza, where the Hotel Concierge, played by Curry, and the bellboy, played by Schneider, become suspicious of the young boy who's dad they never see. Anyways, the burglars bump into Kevin again and are in for yet another failed heist due to Kevin's wit and all the goodies and traps that he has set up for their painful pleasure!The movie is funny, but it has a similar plot to the original. I'm sure many people who watched the movie in 1992 felt they were watching Home Alone again, which explains why the sequel made less money at the box office than the original.Keep an eye out for former brat-packer Ally Sheedy, who worked with John Hughes in the 1985 classic The Breakfast Club, as a New York ticket agent.RecommendedB+",4,"""Kevin's not here!""",1147651200,"05 15, 2006",2006,2209,"['Macaulay', 'Culkin', 'rose', 'fame', 'Kevin', 'McCallister', '1990', 'blockbuster', 'comedy', 'Home', 'Alone.2', 'years', 'later', '8', 'million', 'dollar', 'salary', 'highest', 'amount', 'ever', 'offered', 'child', 'actor', 'Culkin', 'returned', 'big', 'screen', 'mild', 'success', '1991', 'My', 'Girl', 'sequel', 'starmaking', 'hit.Home', 'Alone', '2', 'Lost', 'New', 'York', 'hilarious', 'movie', 'produced', 'written', 'John', 'Hughes', 'Breakfast', 'Club', 'directed', 'Chris', 'Columbus', 'Mrs.', 'Doubtfire', 'Returning', 'sequel', 'are', 'Joe', 'Pesci', 'Goodfellas', 'Daniel', 'Stern', 'City', 'Slickers', 'dumb', 'burglars', 'Harry', 'Marvin', 'John', 'Heard', '187', 'Catherine', ""O'Hara"", 'Beetlejuice', 'Kevin', 'parents', 'McCallisters', 'entire', 'McCallister', 'family', 'board', 'time', 'around', 'hilarious', 'cast', 'including', 'Tim', 'Curry', 'Oscar', 'Rob', 'Schneider', 'Demolition', 'Man', '.Exactly', 'year', 'passed', 'fateful', 'winter', 'McCallister', 'family', 'again', 'rush', 'airport', 'time', 'catch', 'flight', 'Florida', 'Kevin', 'accidentally', 'flight', 'New', 'York', 'hence', 'title', 'out', ""'wet"", 'bandits', 'Harry', 'Marvin', 'have', 'escaped', 'prison', 'Illinois', 'made', 'city', 'never', 'two', 'theives', 'set', 'plan', 'rob', 'local', 'toy', 'store', 'called', 'Duncan', 'Toy', 'Chest', 'Kevin', 'find', 'interest', 'store', 'manager', 'money', 'holiday', 'children', 'hospital', 'meantime', 'Kevin', 'city', 'checks', 'New', 'York', 'finest', 'hotel', 'Plaza', 'where', 'Hotel', 'Concierge', 'played', 'Curry', 'bellboy', 'played', 'Schneider', 'become', 'suspicious', 'young', 'boy', 'who', 'dad', 'never', 'see', 'Anyways', 'burglars', 'bump', 'Kevin', 'again', 'are', 'yet', 'failed', 'heist', 'due', 'Kevin', 'wit', 'goodies', 'traps', 'set', 'up', 'painful', 'pleasure', 'movie', 'funny', 'similar', 'plot', 'original', ""'m"", 'sure', 'many', 'people', 'who', 'watched', 'movie', '1992', 'felt', 'were', 'watching', 'Home', 'Alone', 'again', 'why', 'sequel', 'made', 'less', 'money', 'box', 'office', 'original.Keep', 'eye', 'out', 'former', 'brat-packer', 'Ally', 'Sheedy', 'who', 'worked', 'John', 'Hughes', '1985', 'classic', 'Breakfast', 'Club', 'New', 'York', 'ticket', 'agent.RecommendedB+']",N/A

333180,AT07UZQQR7ZEH,6302765536,"Stephen H. Wood ""Film scholar and vintage mov...","[3, 6]","Watch HOME ALONE (1990) and HOME ALONE 2: LOST IN NEW YORK (1992) on consecutive nights, and you will experience the ultimate deja vu sensation.  The second film is not a sequel, but a remake with an improved screenplay!  Both movies were directed by Chris Columbus and written/produced by John Hughes.  Film one takes place mostly in the Chicago suburbs at Christmas time--and did the production designers ever have a fun time hanging lights all over three story mansions.  The second film takes place in mostly New York City, also at Christmas time.  Both movies have clips from IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE (1946)--one in French, the other in Spanish.  And both have the identical clip from the fictional ANGELS WITH FILTHY SOULS that are used for similar purposes--to scare away unwanted people.  Finally, both have young hero Kevin McAllister (amazing Macaulay Culkin) taking on the same two burglars and just about killing them.  One wonders how on earth Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern (and the stunt people) survived the stunts in both films.The plots are shamelessly similar.  In film one, Kevin is left at home in his family's elegant Chicago suburbs mansion, while everyone else in the family goes to Paris.  Once in Paris, once mom Catherine O'Hara (wonderful) realizes Kevin is alone, she tries to bribe and cajole passengers to be bumped so that she can get back home right away.  But Kevin is having the time of his life alone with ice cream and cheese pizzas--and having a field day fighting off the Laurel and Hardy-like ""Wet Bandit"" burglars Pesci and Stern.  Helping him is a next door neighbor everyone is afraid of, Roberts Blossom, who has the film's most poignant scene with Kevin in an empty church on Christmas Eve.  John Candy is also wonderful as a polka king who helps O'Hara get to Chicago from, I think, Milwaukee in his band's van.Just as the best scenes in HOME ALONE involve a lonely old man and a polka band, and not the burglars, the burglars are downright irrelevant in LOST IN NEW YORK.  Here the family flies to Miami, leaves Kevin behind in Chicago again, and he ends up alone at the Plaza Hotel with all of Manhattan at Christmas time as his playground.  I like film two much better because of the sublime supporting cast:  Brenda Fricker as a Central Park bird woman, Eddie Bracken as a toy store manager, Tim Curry as a hotel concierge with a grinch smile, and John Schneider as a bellboy who goes crazy with a kid who alternately gives him bubble gum and $50 tips.  (Kevin has his Dad's credit card--up to a point.)  They are so hysterically funny for 90 minutes that it is almost a letdown when burglars Pesci and Stern, still playing ""The Wet Bandits"", show up to menace Kevin in an upper Manhattan brownstone for the last half hour of a long 120 minutes.  Again, I found myself cringing at the realistic and nasty violence, more than laughing at its inventiveness.  I found myself really fearing for actors' and stuntpeoples' lives.  I NEVER FOUND IT FUNNY.  But I adored the ending with mom Catherine O'Hara sweetly reunited with Kevin at Rockefeller Center.  (You just knew it would end that way.)It's Christmas season.  You are busy with your own families and holiday shopping. You have time for one of the first two (there are four total) HOME ALONE movies from John Hughes and Chris Columbus.  Watch film two, LOST IN NEW YORK.  Savor the fabulous supporting cast and the gorgeous color by master cinematographer Julio Macat (who also shot the first film in ravishing deep oranges and greens).  John Williams' score on both films is special, too, as always.

333188,AU1OTANVBW9GM,6302765536,Tyson Babbel,"[0, 0]","I watched the 1st Home Alone recently on T.V. just a couple of weeks ago not during the holiday season.  After watching the first film, I've thought to myself that yeah while I've seen it numerous times and am sure to see it again, it's gotten old as I'm starting to realize there isn't much of a plot to the movie other then a bratty 8-year old kid wanting to stay home alone, and accidentally getting left home alone by his parents.  He enjoys it a lot at first, but realizes how much he misses his family, now he has to defend his house against burglars in the area.  So, while watching it again always thinking Home Alone is a film that will entertain me, I didn't think it was worth watching it as I've noticed most of the movie is pretty slow until the climax.I've seen the 2nd one during Christmas and I have to say, I like this one better.  Here are some reasons, the first one basically just shows Kevin in his neighborhood, this one shows Kevin in NYC.  This film is also about his own vacation.  The traps in this movie are violent and funny.  You'll crack up watching it.  I also think it's faster pace than the first.  So, I'll have to give Home Alone 2 5 stars.One recommendation I've come up with myself, I really wouldn't recommend watching either Home Alone until the holiday season.  A Facebook friend called the Holiday Season, the Home Alone season.  They're on TV various times throughout the year and always on during the holiday season.  I think watching these movies gives a long time Christmas spirit from previous years in which we've probably seen it.  But, just like you probably wouldn't listen to Christmas music in the middle of the year when it's no where near Christmas, it's probably better to save these movies for the holiday season.",5,I Prefer This Over The First.

This time the hapless Kevin, played by Macaulay Culkin, is lost in New York and he is living it up. The burglurs from the original movie are after him again, but the end is predictably sad for them and funny for the audience. The movie features a homeless woman who plays Nicola Tesla to local pigeons and in the end helps Kevin to defeat the criminals. Kevin also displays social consciousness and compassion trying to ensure a good Christmas for orphaned children. And it is not too corny to work.

The second one had such potential, but they ruined it in so many ways.  First of all, he isn't Home Alone, so the title alone is ridiculously incorrect.  He is accidently in NY while his family is searching for him.  Everything is so repetitive-from eating ice cream while watching movies, to the pranks he plays on the villains.  What I noticed most was the furniture in his hotel room.  It is from the house set of the first movie!  Look at the 4 poster bed, the tv, the tables, even the lamp and the decorations around the fireplace.  After all the money they made on the first movie, they couldn't even purchase new props?  Stick with the first movie-this one is just a remake with a lot of bad choices.  No charm, whatsover.  I gave it 2 stars for keeping the same cast and the lovely scene of the toy store.
