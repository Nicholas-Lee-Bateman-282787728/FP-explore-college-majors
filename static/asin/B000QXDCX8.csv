1078070,A2FNE3CGLVMHB3,B000QXDCX8,"Brooke ""islandr1""","[0, 1]","I have followed Elaine Stritch's career for decades.  She belongs to that special inner circle of unique stage stars, such as Mary Martin, Carol Channing, Gwen Verdon, and Ethel Merman.  I have seen Stritch on stage myself, and enjoyed her roles and talents as shown not only on stage, but on TV shows and in movies.As an Anglophile, I thought I had seen all of the Britcoms since the early '70s.  Somehow, I missed this one.  I was delighted to find Two's Company sold on Amazon.com, and have watched all of the episodes.  I won't go into the plot and characters since that is ably done by other reviewers. However, I did find that the word ""hilarious"" is not how I would describe the adventures.  I thought they were amusing, but too much alike in situations that mainly focus on just the two main characters.  The sound track for laughter was disturbing; it was too loud.  I don't know if it is due to the new recording or if the audience was live and just too loud. Laughter, in my opinion, should not be louder than the characters' speech.While I do not like saying anything negative about Stritch's performance, she did seem to be forcing her ""enthusiasm"" in voice and demeanor in many of the episodes.  I kept thinking ""rehearsed too much."" Some of the episodes were very enjoyable, but not all.My overall impression is that this is a wonderful series that I enjoyed watching, but only because of Stritch and Sinden.  I wouldn't have enjoyed it at all if not for them.  The negative is that I probably will not watch it again soon. The very best part of each episode is that unique gravely-voiced song by Stritch, with Sinden's voice not as strong or interesting.  When I think of this series, I will first recall the opening song and graphics: absolutely superb!",3,"Delightful, But Not as ""Hilarious"" as Others' Reviewed",1335571200,"04 28, 2012",2012,1770,"['have', 'followed', 'Elaine', 'Stritch', 'career', 'decades', 'special', 'inner', 'circle', 'unique', 'stage', 'stars', 'such', 'Mary', 'Martin', 'Carol', 'Channing', 'Gwen', 'Verdon', 'Ethel', 'Merman', 'have', 'seen', 'Stritch', 'stage', 'enjoyed', 'roles', 'talents', 'shown', 'not', 'only', 'stage', 'TV', 'shows', 'movies.As', 'Anglophile', 'thought', 'had', 'seen', 'Britcoms', 'early', 'Somehow', 'missed', 'one', 'was', 'delighted', 'find', 'Two', 'Company', 'sold', 'Amazon.com', 'have', 'watched', 'episodes', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'plot', 'characters', 'ably', 'done', 'other', 'reviewers', 'However', 'did', 'find', 'word', 'hilarious', 'not', 'how', 'would', 'describe', 'adventures', 'thought', 'were', 'amusing', 'too', 'much', 'situations', 'mainly', 'focus', 'just', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'sound', 'track', 'laughter', 'was', 'disturbing', 'was', 'too', 'loud', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'due', 'new', 'recording', 'audience', 'was', 'live', 'just', 'too', 'loud', 'Laughter', 'opinion', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'louder', 'characters', 'speech.While', 'do', 'not', 'saying', 'anything', 'negative', 'Stritch', 'performance', 'did', 'seem', 'be', 'forcing', 'enthusiasm', 'voice', 'demeanor', 'many', 'episodes', 'kept', 'thinking', 'rehearsed', 'too', 'much', 'episodes', 'were', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'not', 'all.My', 'overall', 'impression', 'wonderful', 'series', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'only', 'Stritch', 'Sinden', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'enjoyed', 'not', 'negative', 'probably', 'will', 'not', 'watch', 'again', 'soon', 'very', 'best', 'part', 'episode', 'unique', 'gravely-voiced', 'song', 'Stritch', 'Sinden', 'voice', 'not', 'strong', 'interesting', 'When', 'think', 'series', 'will', 'first', 'recall', 'opening', 'song', 'graphics', 'absolutely', 'superb']",N/A
1078071,ABH4G7TVI6G2T,B000QXDCX8,Byron Kolln,"[0, 0]","Commissioned by London Weekend Television (LWT) in 1975, TWO'S COMPANY starred the divine Elaine Stritch as Dorothy McNab, an American mystery novelist living and working in London, who takes on the stuffy, oh-so-teddibly British Robert (Donald Sinden) as her butler. Sparks fly when Dorothy, who is under the false belief that everyone is meant to have equal footing in this life, is ""instructed"" by Robert in the correct way (ie: HIS way) of running a household. Madly bashing away at the typewriter, Dorothy needs an organised and relaxed home life...but she never counted on tightly-wound Robert. Just WHO is the help and who is the boss?!Wickedly scripted by Bill MacIllwraith, TWO'S COMPANY offered viewers of British comedy something a little more sophisticated and biting than the usual fare, with the humour extending from the dry wordplay between Dorothy and Robert. The show came during one of Elaine Stritch's most prolific periods of her professional career. She had chiefly relocated to London for the successful West End transfer of ""Company"", but decided to stay in the country on a full-time basis when she married English actor John Bay. Setting up housekeeping at the Savoy Hotel no less, Stritch was the darling of the London talk show circuit, and also starred as Aunt Polly in a miniseries of ""Pollyanna"" for the BBC.This box set includes all four series of TWO'S COMPANY (29 episodes in total).",4,one of the best Britcoms you'll ever have the pleasure of seeing,1277942400,"07 1, 2010",2010,1417,"['Commissioned', 'London', 'Weekend', 'Television', 'LWT', '1975', 'TWO', 'COMPANY', 'starred', 'divine', 'Elaine', 'Stritch', 'Dorothy', 'McNab', 'American', 'mystery', 'novelist', 'living', 'working', 'London', 'who', 'stuffy', 'oh-so-teddibly', 'British', 'Robert', 'Donald', 'Sinden', 'butler', 'Sparks', 'fly', 'when', 'Dorothy', 'who', 'false', 'belief', 'everyone', 'meant', 'have', 'equal', 'footing', 'life', 'instructed', 'Robert', 'correct', 'way', 'ie', 'HIS', 'way', 'running', 'household', 'Madly', 'bashing', 'away', 'typewriter', 'Dorothy', 'organised', 'relaxed', 'home', 'life', 'never', 'counted', 'tightly-wound', 'Robert', 'Just', 'WHO', 'help', 'who', 'boss', 'Wickedly', 'scripted', 'Bill', 'MacIllwraith', 'TWO', 'COMPANY', 'offered', 'viewers', 'British', 'comedy', 'something', 'little', 'more', 'sophisticated', 'biting', 'usual', 'fare', 'humour', 'extending', 'dry', 'wordplay', 'Dorothy', 'Robert', 'show', 'came', 'one', 'Elaine', 'Stritch', 'most', 'prolific', 'periods', 'professional', 'career', 'had', 'chiefly', 'relocated', 'London', 'successful', 'West', 'End', 'transfer', 'Company', 'decided', 'stay', 'country', 'full-time', 'basis', 'when', 'married', 'English', 'actor', 'John', 'Bay', 'Setting', 'up', 'housekeeping', 'Savoy', 'Hotel', 'less', 'Stritch', 'was', 'darling', 'London', 'talk', 'show', 'circuit', 'also', 'starred', 'Aunt', 'Polly', 'miniseries', 'Pollyanna', 'BBC.This', 'box', 'set', 'four', 'series', 'TWO', 'COMPANY', '29', 'episodes', 'total']",N/A
1078072,AZB4CQ9JZSUQB,B000QXDCX8,Eric Pregosin,"[22, 23]","The late 1970s aka the Bicentennial era.  What could be better Britcom for the era than a battle of wits between an American and Englishperson?  That is exactly what happens in Two's Company.  From the minute you see the opening credits roll with the stars singing the title song in the guise of the American Eagle and the British Lion, you know you are in for a romp.  The premise comes about right away in the first episode on the first disc. Dorothy McNab (played to the hilt by veteran stage presence Elaine Stritch) is a ""pre Jessica Fletcher"" American mystery writer residing in a duplex England.  When she is not typing away her latest murder, she is entertaining guests and naturally finds it hard to handle both at the same time, so she inquired an employment agency about supplying her with a butler and handyman.  On a wet rainy day, while typing out her latest novel, coming to call is the well experienced and veddy British Robert Hiller (played equally to the hilt by Donald Sinden).  From the second they make eye contact, sparks fly, she doesn't care that much for the British in general and he has his own views on Americans and women for that matter.  Although it rarely comes up verbally, it is implied in his eyes we are still in the 1770s not the 1970s, so like I said a perfect series for the time it aired.  Despite these clashes, he appears to be just what the doctor (I mean author) ordered.  The truth eventually comes out, she gives him the job when he proves his cooking and coffee making skills are better than anyone she knows, and he takes the job because he was looking forward to a job where not only he has his own flat to live in, but he doesn't have to drive himself ragged taking care of a whole family as he did at his last job.  The clashes still occur now and then, but despite everything, they eventually do develop a friendship in sorts for each other.  I first backed into this series in the 80s on reruns on PBS after Mystery of all shows.  It cracked me up then, and went out of my way to buy all 4 discs when they came out.  Now go figure, 1 year and a half after releasing all 4 separately, my ""friends"" at Acorn go and offer a mega set which Amazon is selling for roughly the retail price of 2 of them. They are also doing it with House of Elliot which I also bought in separate installments.  Nothing new added or anything, so I'm not complaining, except that my friends in Montgomery County (Acorn) has got to start taking lessons from A&E other manufacturers on when to release mega sets vs individuals.  Those of you who have not started to buy this series yet, buy this set, if you have at least 2 of the them already, complete your collection the easy way as all 4 individuals are still available.  Either way, this is a ""BUY IT"" in my book, your sides will split for another 30 years or more.",5,"One of the Best Britcoms of the 70s, still hilarious 30 years later",1186531200,"08 8, 2007",2007,2847,"['late', '1970s', 'Bicentennial', 'era', 'What', 'could', 'be', 'better', 'Britcom', 'era', 'battle', 'wits', 'American', 'Englishperson', 'exactly', 'what', 'Two', 'Company', 'minute', 'see', 'opening', 'credits', 'roll', 'stars', 'singing', 'title', 'song', 'guise', 'American', 'Eagle', 'British', 'Lion', 'know', 'are', 'romp', 'premise', 'about', 'right', 'away', 'first', 'episode', 'first', 'disc', 'Dorothy', 'McNab', 'played', 'hilt', 'veteran', 'stage', 'presence', 'Elaine', 'Stritch', 'pre', 'Jessica', 'Fletcher', 'American', 'mystery', 'writer', 'residing', 'duplex', 'England', 'When', 'not', 'typing', 'away', 'latest', 'murder', 'entertaining', 'guests', 'naturally', 'hard', 'handle', 'same', 'time', 'inquired', 'employment', 'agency', 'supplying', 'butler', 'handyman', 'wet', 'rainy', 'day', 'typing', 'out', 'latest', 'novel', 'coming', 'call', 'well', 'experienced', 'veddy', 'British', 'Robert', 'Hiller', 'played', 'equally', 'hilt', 'Donald', 'Sinden', 'second', 'make', 'eye', 'contact', 'fly', ""n't"", 'care', 'that', 'much', 'British', 'general', 'own', 'views', 'Americans', 'women', 'matter', 'rarely', 'up', 'verbally', 'implied', 'eyes', 'are', 'still', '1770s', 'not', '1970s', 'said', 'perfect', 'series', 'time', 'aired', 'clashes', 'be', 'just', 'what', 'doctor', 'mean', 'author', 'ordered', 'truth', 'eventually', 'out', 'job', 'when', 'cooking', 'coffee', 'making', 'skills', 'are', 'better', 'anyone', 'job', 'was', 'looking', 'forward', 'job', 'where', 'not', 'only', 'own', 'flat', 'live', ""n't"", 'have', 'drive', 'ragged', 'taking', 'care', 'whole', 'family', 'did', 'last', 'job', 'clashes', 'still', 'occur', 'now', 'then', 'everything', 'eventually', 'do', 'develop', 'friendship', 'sorts', 'other', 'first', 'backed', 'series', '80s', 'reruns', 'PBS', 'Mystery', 'shows', 'cracked', 'up', 'then', 'went', 'way', 'buy', '4', 'discs', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'Now', 'go', 'figure', '1', 'year', 'half', 'releasing', '4', 'separately', 'friends', 'Acorn', 'go', 'offer', 'mega', 'set', 'Amazon', 'selling', 'roughly', 'retail', 'price', '2', 'are', 'also', 'doing', 'House', 'Elliot', 'also', 'bought', 'separate', 'installments', 'Nothing', 'new', 'added', 'anything', ""'m"", 'not', 'complaining', 'friends', 'Montgomery', 'County', 'Acorn', 'got', 'start', 'taking', 'lessons', 'A', 'E', 'other', 'manufacturers', 'when', 'release', 'mega', 'sets', 'vs', 'individuals', 'who', 'have', 'not', 'started', 'buy', 'series', 'yet', 'buy', 'set', 'have', 'least', '2', 'already', 'complete', 'collection', 'easy', 'way', '4', 'individuals', 'are', 'still', 'available', 'way', 'BUY', 'IT', 'book', 'sides', 'will', 'split', '30', 'years', 'more']",N/A

I loved Elaine Stritch who plays an American mystery author Dorothy McNab living in London and Donald Sinden (whom I developed a crush on lol) who perfectly plays Robert her Britsh butler, he is spot on. I loved this series. One of my favorite episodes is on Series One episode 4 called The Patient. Robert trips over Dorothy's shoe and hurts his ankle, and he has National Health, which Dorothy doesn't know anything about. She can't get an ambulance so she takes him to the hospital for treatment,and it is very funny, I was laughing so hard.There are 4 disc's  and 29 episodes. The chemistry between the two I think added to the enjoyment of the series. The bickering between them is very funny. I loved this series. In my opinion the humor is similar to the humor in Open All Hours (which I also love) where you know even though the characters might disagree, they still care for each other. I hated for the last episode to end, I wanted more of Dorothy and Robert adventures. I was able to pick this up at a great price.
