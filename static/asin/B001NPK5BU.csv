I didn't even know it was being released on DVD until I was in the store the other day and saw it!!  I grabbed it immediately, almost leaping with joy out to my car!Its even better than I remember.  This is a sitcom that was truly a ""family"" show.  All members of the cast had great chemistry together!!  No wonder the series became a huge hit!!Its decent, yet heartwarming and even inspiring ""controversial"" episodes that are dealt with in a sensitive, loving way.  The series isn't mawkishly sentimental either.  Its just good, clean, wholesome fun.  Best of all......it is FUNNY!!!!  Watching Mr. Belvedere one-up everyone or the multi-talented Brice Beckham as Wesley steal the show makes for great classic television.I also remember thinking how pretty Tracy Wells (Heather) was and how clean-cut and handsome Rob Stone (Kevin) was (he still is).This is an awesome family show and I hope we won't be disappointed in the fact that companies have the habit of releasing great shows like this for one or two seasons....then don't release the rest of them.  Bring the rest of the seasons of this great, classic family sitcom on.....pronto!!",5,"CLEAN, WHOLESOME AND INSPIRING!!!",1240358400,"04 22, 2009",2009,1266,"['One', 'last', 'truly', 'great', 'family', 'sitcoms', 'remember', 'watching', 'Mr.', 'Belvedere', 'Friday', 'nights', 'first-run', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'was', 'being', 'released', 'DVD', 'was', 'store', 'other', 'day', 'saw', 'grabbed', 'immediately', 'almost', 'leaping', 'joy', 'car', 'even', 'better', 'remember', 'sitcom', 'was', 'truly', 'family', 'show', 'members', 'cast', 'had', 'great', 'chemistry', 'together', 'wonder', 'series', 'became', 'huge', 'hit', 'decent', 'heartwarming', 'even', 'inspiring', 'controversial', 'episodes', 'are', 'dealt', 'sensitive', 'loving', 'way', 'series', ""n't"", 'mawkishly', 'sentimental', 'either', 'just', 'good', 'clean', 'wholesome', 'fun', 'Best', 'FUNNY', 'Watching', 'Mr.', 'Belvedere', 'one-up', 'everyone', 'multi-talented', 'Brice', 'Beckham', 'Wesley', 'steal', 'show', 'great', 'classic', 'television.I', 'also', 'remember', 'thinking', 'how', 'pretty', 'Tracy', 'Wells', 'Heather', 'was', 'how', 'clean-cut', 'handsome', 'Rob', 'Stone', 'Kevin', 'was', 'still', '.This', 'awesome', 'family', 'show', 'hope', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed', 'fact', 'companies', 'have', 'habit', 'releasing', 'great', 'shows', 'one', 'two', 'seasons', '.then', 'do', ""n't"", 'release', 'rest', 'Bring', 'rest', 'seasons', 'great', 'classic', 'family', 'sitcom', '..pronto']",Mr. Belvedere: Seasons One & Two
1220971,A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ,B001NPK5BU,"Barry ""Barrybgb""","[6, 7]","1985. What a wonderful year it was. It was definitley a joy and a treat to be a little kid in this era. 1985 was no exception. This was the year that brought us ""Back To The Future"", ""The Goonies"", ""The Breakfast Club"", and so much more. Tears For Fears, Wham!, Madonna, and others were ruling the music charts. And on TV, ""The Cosby Show"", ""Family Ties"", ""Cheers"" and many more were taking over your living room. 1985 also brought us another family sitcom, a type of sitcom prevalent in the 1980's, and this one featured a prim and proper english butler. A butler named Mr. Belvedere. Lynn Belvedere, to be exact.""Mr. Belvedere"" premiered as a mid season replacement on ABC on March 15, 1985. Here is the set up : The Owens family are a typical family household, five members, and living in the suburbs of Pittsburgh. Dad George Owens(Bob Uecker, ""Major League"")is a sports columnist. Mom is Marsha Ownes(Ilene Graff), a mother and wife who is going to school to become a lawyer. And what is a family sitcoms without the kids?. The Owens family has three kids. Teenagers Kevin(Rob Stone)and Heather(Tracy Wells), and little Wesley(Brice Beckham). The parents have their hands full, and need a little help. Mr. Belvedere(Christopher Hewitt)lands on their doorstep just in time and, with some shoving by the others to George, becomes the new Owens housekeeper.""Mr. Belvedere"" was not a major hit, and from what I hear, struggled to stay on the air for it's six seasons. It is a fondly remembered series from my youth, and it is wonderful to see that it has held up surprisingly well. The first episode, ""Stranger In The Night"", sets things up and gets it going. Belvedere makes an impression on the family members, mainly Marsha and the kids, but tough 'ol George hasn't been swayed. When he finally is, the next 6 seasons are set in motion. And with this set, you get the first two seasons. 29 episodes in all. And what do these two seasons hold in the zany chaos of the Owens household?. Read on....Season one, being a mid season show, was pretty short. 7 episodes in all. Wesley is front and center in a few episodes, such as not being invited to a friend's birthday party in ""The Outcasts"", to trying out for the ballet instead of football in ""Gotta Dance"". Heather and Kevin get their turns too. Kevin tries to win over a girl in ""What I Did For Love"". As the 6 seasons go on, this will be a recurring theme for Kevin. Sometimes his endeavors are funny, sometimes a little scary. Heather, along with Wesley, brings a homeless lady to the house in the season one finale, ""Sweet Charity"". Season 2 has one of the most remembered and talked about episodes of the show. In the episode ""Wesley's Friend"", Wes discovers a friend of his has AIDS. It was one of, if not the first, series, especially a sitcom, to cover such a topic. It would of been pretty daring and risky back in 1985, but the episode handles the subject very well, as Belvedere helps others to understand the disease and the real facts of it. A tornado also hits the Ownes residence in, fittingly enough, ""Tornado"". More ""special episode"" material can be found in ""The Contract"", about drinking and driving. The romantic side for the oldest Owens kids take some interesting turns when Heather falls for her blind tutot in ""Heather's Tutor"", and Kevin falls for an amish girl and decides to live like one in ""Amish"". Oh these episode titles. Right to the point!. And lots, lots more!.""Mr. Belvedere"" may not of got the acclaim, may of taken a lot of pot shots, but the series was always better than you'd think. Sure, it could be corny and syrupy(but who says that is always a bad thing?), but it had an edge to it. Maybe 'edge' is not the appropriate word, but there are times where the show seems to know what it is and has some fun with it. There probably weren't too many family shows where, in the pilot, Wesley mentions his dad's girlie magazines and Belvedere, having just met Wesley, asks Marsha if it was a rough pregnancy. It's little things like this, and better ones, that were peppered throughout the series. It may seem tame by today's standards, but there seemed to be something a lot better going on than what occasional/non watchers or overly critical people may of thought. Not that I am praising the series as the greatest thing since sliced bread, but it was good for what it was, better than some may give it credit for, and deserving of a little more attention than it got. While the Huxtables and Keatons and Seavers were the families of the 80's, the Owens family held their own, week to week, on their little show that could. It also benefitted from a pretty solid cast. Every one held their own, and seemed comfortable as a family, but the spotlight usually goes to Christopher Hewitt and Brice Beckham, as Belvedere and Wesley. The banter between the english housekeeper and George was fun and amusing, but the relationship between Belvedere and Wesley was the most interesting. Beckham was a very good child actor. Wes could be real bratty(I believe some have said ""devil child"" as well), but Beckahm was good at it. Hewitt was wonderful, and even though it seemed he and Wesley were constantly at each other's throats, you knew that they really, really cared for each other.The final disc boasts some extra features. The first is a pretty quick featurette with the cast of the show(sadly, Hewitt has passed away, and Tracy Wells is nowhere to be seen). Uecker, Graff(who will surprise you as she has seemingly not aged a day since the series went off the air in 1990), Beckham, and Stone, all share stories. What's really wonderful is that they got along and still stay in contact like a family to this day. The other featurette is a skit from 'Saturday Night Live' about Belvedere, and it features Tom Hanks. Also, if you click on Mr. Belvedere's head on the last disc, you will find an Easter egg.In the end, ""Mr. Belvedere"" may not of been the most popular of 1980's family sitcoms, a decade which was packed with them, nor was it groundbreaking television. But it was a nice, sweet, entertaining little show that has held it's simple charm all these years later.",4,"""Streaks On The China....""",1241395200,"05 4, 2009",2009,6160,"['1985', 'What',

1220973,A3SHA4Y9DHEK39,B001NPK5BU,Chad Oberholtzer,"[3, 18]","I loved Mr. Belvedere as a kid growing up in the 1980's.  But after it was cancelled, I don't know that I've ever seen an episode in syndication.  So, when I stumbled upon this DVD set of Seasons 1 and 2 on Amazon, I was really excited to experience this show again, after a 20+ year hiatus.  I could not have been more disappointed.My greatest frustration was the ridiculously poor writing and directing on this show.  The dialogue is so fake and the directing choices are so artificial or downright lazy.  It's laughable in all the wrong ways.  And the acting wasn't much better (though I'm not sure they could have done much better with those scripts).  Mr. Belvedere's response to every line from the Owens family was either an eye-roll or a lifted eye-brow.  Seriously, he does each of those maneuvers a dozen times in each episode.Of course, not everything about the show was terrible.  The theme song remains one of the most memorable theme songs in sitcom history (sung by Leon Redbone), and it's been running through my head constantly since I began watching these episodes (which I don't mind at all).  And there were a few sweet moments that were actually quite endearing.  But I'd say that I probably laughed less than once per episode, on average, which is a dreadfully low chuckle-rate for a comedy series.Just to be clear, I really wanted to love this show again.  But after suffering through every episode of these first two seasons, I just can't fake it.  Unlike other sitcoms from the 80's (like Perfect Strangers which remains charming and funny and The Cosby Show which remains brilliantly written and acted), Mr. Belvedere has aged very poorly.  Rather than a nostalgic reentry to a show that I once enjoyed, Belvedere turns out to be out-dated, cheesy, heavy-handed, poorly executed, and decidedly unfunny.  I'd recommend that folks with a hint of sweet memories of the show just listen to the theme song a few times, rather than wading through this rather forgettable sitcom from an era of television history that we've thankfully left behind.",2,Dreadfully dated...,1303862400,"04 27, 2011",2011,2066,"['loved', 'Mr.', 'Belvedere', 'kid', 'growing', 'up', '1980', 'was', 'cancelled', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'episode', 'syndication', 'So', 'when', 'stumbled', 'DVD', 'set', 'Seasons', '1', '2', 'Amazon', 'was', 'really', 'excited', 'experience', 'show', 'again', '20+', 'year', 'hiatus', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'disappointed.My', 'greatest', 'frustration', 'was', 'ridiculously', 'poor', 'writing', 'directing', 'show', 'dialogue', 'so', 'fake', 'directing', 'choices', 'are', 'so', 'artificial', 'downright', 'lazy', 'laughable', 'wrong', 'ways', 'acting', 'was', ""n't"", 'much', 'better', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'much', 'better', 'scripts', 'Mr.', 'Belvedere', 'response', 'line', 'Owens', 'family', 'was', 'eye-roll', 'lifted', 'eye-brow', 'Seriously', 'maneuvers', 'dozen', 'times', 'episode.Of', 'course', 'not', 'everything', 'show', 'was', 'terrible', 'theme', 'song', 'one', 'most', 'memorable', 'theme', 'songs', 'sitcom', 'history', 'sung', 'Leon', 'Redbone', 'been', 'running', 'head', 'constantly', 'began', 'watching', 'episodes', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'were', 'few', 'sweet', 'moments', 'were', 'actually', 'quite', 'endearing', ""'d"", 'say', 'probably', 'laughed', 'less', 'once', 'episode', 'average', 'dreadfully', 'low', 'chuckle-rate', 'comedy', 'series.Just', 'be', 'clear', 'really', 'wanted', 'love', 'show', 'again', 'suffering', 'episode', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'fake', 'other', 'sitcoms', '80', 'Perfect', 'Strangers', 'charming', 'funny', 'Cosby', 'Show', 'brilliantly', 'written', 'acted', 'Mr.', 'Belvedere', 'aged', 'very', 'poorly', 'Rather', 'nostalgic', 'reentry', 'show', 'once', 'enjoyed', 'Belvedere', 'out', 'be', 'out-dated', 'cheesy', 'heavy-handed', 'poorly', 'executed', 'decidedly', 'unfunny', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'folks', 'hint', 'sweet', 'memories', 'show', 'just', 'listen', 'theme', 'song', 'few', 'times', 'rather', 'wading', 'rather', 'forgettable', 'sitcom', 'era', 'television', 'history', ""'ve"", 'thankfully', 'left', 'behind']",Mr. Belvedere: Seasons One & Two

1220975,A15STWX7P0NE0D,B001NPK5BU,Christopher R. Hernandez,"[25, 25]","Shout! has done another excellent job with their release of Mr Belvedere seasons one & two.  The episodes are all the original network episodes, not syndicated cuts.  The original opening credits have been restored, inculding the original pilot opening.  No music is replaced.  The video is for the most part fine.  Occasionally there is a blurry spot but the show is over 20 years old.  The audio sounds fine also, but occasionally the sound is slightly lower in some spots.Now for the show itself.  I watched this show when it originally aired and haven't seen it much in syndication since.  My memory of the show is mostly from it's original network run.  I loved the show then but wasn't mature enough to fully appreciate it's humor.  After watching this set I enjoyed the show even more than I remembered.  As an adult I can catch the adult jokes that I missed when I was a kid.  This show is as entertaining to adults as it is to a younger audience.  It holds up well.  I watched episode after episode not wanting to come to the end and enjoying every second of it.The set does have special features.  There are interviews with the surviving cast members (minus Tracy Wells).  They talk about how much fun they had on the show, including the pranks they played on each other.  They talk of their fond memories and how they are still rmeembered to this day for their Mr Belvedere roles.  Hopefully future sets will have an interview with Tracy Wells.  The other special feature is the SNL Mr Belvedere fan club skit.  That has nothing to do with the show, but it is hysterically funny.  Tom Hanks is in it. The set also features two clips Family Guy in which Stewie sings the Mr Belvedere theme song.  This is also mentioned in the interviews.If anyone is on the fence about buying this set and worrying that they won't enjoy it as much as they remember, worry no more.  The show is better than remembered.  A few plots may be dated but as a whole the show stands up very well.  You won't be disappointed.",5,Better than you will remember,1238198400,"03 28, 2009",2009,2010,"['Shout', 'done', 'excellent', 'job', 'release', 'Mr', 'Belvedere', 'one', 'two', 'episodes', 'are', 'original', 'network', 'episodes', 'not', 'syndicated', 'cuts', 'original', 'opening', 'credits', 'have', 'been', 'restored', 'inculding', 'original', 'pilot', 'opening', 'music', 'replaced', 'video', 'most', 'part', 'fine', 'Occasionally', 'blurry', 'spot', 'show', '20', 'years', 'old', 'audio', 'sounds', 'fine', 'also', 'occasionally', 'sound', 'slightly', 'lower', 'spots.Now', 'show', 'watched', 'show', 'when', 'originally', 'aired', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'much', 'syndication', 'memory', 'show', 'mostly', 'original', 'network', 'run', 'loved', 'show', 'then', 'was', ""n't"", 'mature', 'enough', 'fully', 'appreciate', 'humor', 'watching', 'set', 'enjoyed', 'show', 'even', 'more', 'remembered', 'adult', 'can', 'catch', 'adult', 'missed', 'when', 'was', 'kid', 'show', 'entertaining', 'adults', 'younger', 'audience', 'up', 'well', 'watched', 'episode', 'episode', 'not', 'wanting', 'come', 'end', 'enjoying', 'second', 'it.The', 'set', 'have', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'interviews', 'surviving', 'cast', 'members', 'Tracy', 'Wells', 'talk', 'how', 'much', 'fun', 'had', 'show', 'including', 'pranks', 'played', 'other', 'talk', 'fond', 'memories', 'how', 'are', 'still', 'rmeembered', 'day', 'Mr', 'Belvedere', 'Hopefully', 'future', 'sets', 'will', 'have', 'interview', 'Tracy', 'Wells', 'other', 'special', 'feature', 'SNL', 'Mr', 'Belvedere', 'fan', 'club', 'skit', 'nothing', 'do', 'show', 'hysterically', 'funny', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'set', 'also', 'two', 'clips', 'Family', 'Guy', 'Stewie', 'Mr', 'Belvedere', 'theme', 'song', 'also', 'mentioned', 'interviews.If', 'anyone', 'fence', 'buying', 'set', 'worrying', 'wo', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'as', 'much', 'remember', 'worry', 'more', 'show', 'better', 'remembered', 'few', 'plots', 'may', 'be', 'dated', 'whole', 'show', 'up', 'very', 'well', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed']",Mr. Belvedere: Seasons One & Two

1220977,A2BEU7GPGNIG44,B001NPK5BU,Dorrie Wheeler,"[1, 4]","Shout Factory has released gMr. Belvedere Seasonfs One and Twoh on DVD. gMr. Belvedereh was a family friendly sitcom that premiered on ABC in the month of March 1985. The show quickly became a favorite of television viewers. Christopher Hewett, a British actor, starred on the sitcom as friendly, boisterous butler Mr. Belvedere. Mr. Belvedere was hired by the Owens family in the shows first episode. The premise of the series revolves around the butler living in the home and helping to raise the children of George and Marsha Owens. Child actor Brice Beckham starred in the series as witty Wesley Owens. Wesley and Mr. Belvedere had great candor and shared many laughs. Wesley was quite a scene stealer. The show featured two teenage actors that starred on the series as Heather and Kevin.The best way to describe gMr. Belvedereh is as a family friendly sitcom with a family addition that helped to raise the family. Mr. Belvedere shared in the child raising with George and Marsha Owens. There wasnft a great deal of jealously when it came to parenting type of scenarios. The household children listened to Mr. Belvedere and welcomed his advice and opinions.The episodes are memorable. gMr Belvedereh didnft spend a great deal of time in syndication. Many of these episodes havenft been seen in years. Memorable episodes include the episodes gSweet Charity,h in which Heather and Wesley bring home a homeless woman, gRequiem,h where Wesley becomes conflicted after the death of his accordian teacher, gWesleyfs Friend,h in which Wesleyfs friend is diagnosed with AIDS, and the episode gAmish,h in which the oldest teenage son Kevin starts dating an Amish girl and changes his lifestyle. The good thing about the episode gWesleyfs Friendh is that it introduced AIDS to the family viewing audience. This episode was one of the first family sitcom episodes to introduce AIDS to the viewing audience.gMr. Belvedere Seasons 1 & 2 on DVD is a five disc collection that features 29 episodes. The air dates for the episodes on the disc range from March 15th, 1985 to March 28th 1986. Bonus features on the fifth disc include a featurette titled gThe Owens Family Remembers.h This feature includes brand new interview footage with cast members Bob Uecker, Ilene Graff, Brice Beckham and Rob Stone. Itfs really cool to see child actor Brice Beckham all grown up. The other cast members look great. Itfs nice that Shout Factory went through the effort of reuniting cast members for this interview. In addition to the feature with interviews, the DVD set includes a Saturday Night Live sketch titled gMr. Belvedere Fan Club.h Itfs pretty cool that the rights owners of Saturday Night Live allowed this content to be included in the DVD box set. Fans of gMr. Belvedereh the series should be pleased that Shout Factory went through the effort to include bonus material. gMr. Belvedereh Seasons 1 & 2 on DVD is a great purchase and fans of the show will be pleased to finally own this favorite on DVD.",5,Great DVD Release,1235952000,"03 2, 2009",2009,2990,"['Shout', 'Factory', 'released', 'gMr', 'Belvedere', 'Seasonfs', 'One', 'Twoh', 'DVD', 'gMr', 'Belvedereh', 'was', 'family', 'friendly', 'sitcom', 'premiered', 'ABC', 'month', 'March', '1985', 'show', 'quickly', 'became', 'favorite', 'television', 'viewers', 'Christopher', 'Hewett', 'British', 'actor', 'starred', 'sitcom', 'friendly', 'boisterous', 'butler', 'Mr.', 'Belvedere', 'Mr.', 'Belvedere', 'was', 'hired', 'Owens', 'family', 'shows', 'first', 'episode', 'premise', 'series', 'butler', 'living', 'home', 'helping', 'raise', 'children', 'George', 'Marsha', 'Owens', 'Child', 'actor', 'Brice', 'Beckham', 'starred', 'series', 'witty', 'Wesley', 'Owens', 'Wesley', 'Mr.', 'Belvedere', 'had', 'great', 'candor', 'shared', 'many', 'laughs', 'Wesley', 'was', 'quite', 'scene', 'stealer', 'show', 'featured', 'two', 'teenage', 'actors', 'starred', 'series', 'Heather', 'Kevin.The', 'best', 'way', 'describe', 'gMr', 'Belvedereh', 'family', 'friendly', 'family', 'addition', 'helped', 'raise', 'family', 'Mr.', 'Belvedere', 'shared', 'child', 'raising', 'George', 'Marsha', 'Owens', 'great', 'deal', 'jealously', 'when', 'came', 'parenting', 'type', 'scenarios', 'household', 'children', 'listened', 'Mr.', 'Belvedere', 'welcomed', 'advice', 'opinions.The', 'episodes', 'are', 'memorable', 'gMr', 'Belvedereh', 'spend', 'great', 'deal', 'time', 'syndication', 'Many', 'episodes', 'havenft', 'been', 'seen', 'years', 'Memorable', 'episodes', 'include', 'episodes', 'gSweet', 'Charity', 'h', 'Heather', 'Wesley', 'bring', 'home', 'homeless', 'woman', 'gRequiem', 'h', 'where', 'Wesley', 'conflicted', 'death', 'accordian', 'teacher', 'gWesleyfs', 'Friend', 'h', 'Wesleyfs', 'friend', 'diagnosed', 'AIDS', 'episode', 'gAmish', 'h', 'oldest', 'teenage', 'son', 'Kevin', 'dating', 'Amish', 'girl', 'lifestyle', 'good', 'thing', 'episode', 'gWesleyfs', 'Friendh', 'introduced', 'AIDS', 'family', 'viewing', 'audience', 'episode', 'was', 'one', 'first', 'family', 'sitcom', 'introduce', 'AIDS', 'viewing', 'audience.gMr', 'Belvedere', 'Seasons', '1', '2', 'DVD', 'five', 'disc', 'collection', '29', 'episodes', 'air', 'dates', 'episodes', 'disc', 'range', 'March', '15th', '1985', 'March', '28th', '1986', 'Bonus', 'fifth', 'disc', 'include', 'featurette', 'titled', 'gThe', 'Owens', 'Family', 'Remembers.h', 'feature', 'brand', 'new', 'interview', 'footage', 'cast', 'members', 'Bob', 'Uecker', 'Ilene', 'Graff', 'Brice', 'Beckham', 'Rob', 'Stone', 'Itfs', 'really', 'see', 'child', 'actor', 'Brice', 'Beckham', 'grown', 'up', 'other', 'cast', 'members', 'look', 'great', 'Itfs', 'nice', 'Shout', 'Factory', 'went', 'effort', 'reuniting', 'cast', 'members', 'interview', 'addition', 'feature', 'interviews', 'DVD', 'set', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Live', 'sketch', 'titled', 'gMr', 'Belvedere', 'Fan', 'Club.h', 'Itfs', 'pretty', 'cool', 'rights', 'owners', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Live', 'allowed', 'content', 'be', 'included', 'DVD', 'box', 'set', 'Fans', 'gMr', 'Belvedereh', 'series', 'should', 'be', 'pleased', 'Shout', 'Factory', 'went', 'effort', 'include', 'bonus', 'material', 'gMr', 'Belvedereh', 'Seasons', '1', '2', 'DVD', 'great', 'purchase', 'fans', 'show', 'will', 'be', 'pleased', 'finally', 'own', 'favorite', 'DVD']",Mr. Belvedere: Seasons One & Two

Hornaday,"[24, 28]","If you're sick and tired of today's un-funny and truly mean comedies that are billed as ""family sitcoms,"" then this DVD release of Mr. Belvedere from the mid-1980s is for you.Mr. Belvedere had heart. A Classic TV Family Sitcom that remains vastly underrated, it was based on the Gwen Davenport novel, ""Belvedere,"" which also had spawned two much earlier movie adaptations. The TV series brought a high-brow Englishman to work as a live-in nanny for a middle-class American family. It ran Friday night's on ABC from 1985 to 1990.It starred Christopher Hewitt, who portrayed Lynn Aloysis Belvedere, a very proper Englishman who had worked for the British gentry, including Winston Churchill and English royalty. The series begins when Belvedere shows up at doorstep of  the American residence of George Owens on a very cold and snowy December night. Ownes, played surprisingly well by George Uecker, portrayed exactly what he was in real-life: a former Major League Baseball player and sportscaster.George's wife on the series, Marsha Cameron Owens, played by Ilene Graff, as well as their three children, immediately fall under the charm of Mr. Belvedere. The same cannot be said of George, who has the exact opposite response to Belvedere, and the feeling is decidedly mutual. Nonetheless, Mr. Belvedere is hired and the rest is Classic TV history.Much of the series involves the conflict between George and Mr. Belvedere, but also the interaction of the ""stuffy"" British servant with Marsha, who is also a law student, and the children: Wesley T. Owens, played by Brice Beckham; Kevin Owens, played by Rob Stone; and Heather Owens, played by Tracy Wells. Especially compelling is the relationship that evolves between Belvedere and the spirited and wise-cracking Wesley.At the end of most episodes, Belvedere is seen relaxing in his room in the evenings after the children are in bed, recording their ""everyday"" experiences in his diary for future use for a novel he is writing!A mid-season replacement series that premiered in the middle of March 1985, the first season had only seven episodes. This boxed set includes those episodes and the Complete Second Season, which had 22 episodes.Season One episodes are: Stranger in the Night, the pilot that introduces the characters; The Outcasts; Gotta Dance; Gorgeous George; What I Did for Love; The Lost Weekend; and Sweet Charity.Season Two episodes are: The Lion Sleeps Tonight; Tornado; Cheerleader; Requiem; Delivery; The Contract; Vows; Strike; The Letter; Pinball; The Prize; Speechless; The Teacher; The Dropout; Rivals; Wesley's Friend; The Will; Valentine's Day; Heather's Tutor; Amish; Dinner for Two; and The Play.",5,"Great Show, Well Worth a DVD Release",1231200000,"01 6, 2009",2009,2675,"[""'re"", 'sick', 'tired', 'today', 'un-funny', 'truly', 'mean', 'comedies', 'are', 'billed', 'family', 'sitcoms', 'then', 'DVD', 'release', 'Mr.', 'Belvedere', 'mid-1980s', 'you.Mr', 'Belvedere', 'had', 'heart', 'Classic', 'TV', 'Family', 'Sitcom', 'vastly', 'underrated', 'was', 'based', 'Gwen', 'Davenport', 'novel', 'Belvedere', 'also', 'had', 'spawned', 'two', 'much', 'earlier', 'movie', 'adaptations', 'TV', 'series', 'brought', 'high-brow', 'Englishman', 'work', 'live-in', 'nanny', 'middle-class', 'American', 'family', 'ran', 'Friday', 'night', 'ABC', '1985', '1990.It', 'starred', 'Christopher', 'Hewitt', 'who', 'portrayed', 'Lynn', 'Aloysis', 'Belvedere', 'very', 'proper', 'Englishman', 'who', 'had', 'worked', 'British', 'gentry', 'including', 'Winston', 'Churchill', 'English', 'royalty', 'series', 'when', 'Belvedere', 'up', 'doorstep', 'American', 'residence', 'George', 'Owens', 'very', 'cold', 'snowy', 'December', 'night', 'Ownes', 'played', 'surprisingly', 'well', 'George', 'Uecker', 'portrayed', 'exactly', 'what', 'was', 'real-life', 'former', 'Major', 'League', 'Baseball', 'player', 'sportscaster.George', 'wife', 'series', 'Marsha', 'Cameron', 'Owens', 'played', 'Ilene', 'Graff', 'as', 'well', 'three', 'children', 'immediately', 'fall', 'charm', 'Mr.', 'Belvedere', 'same', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'said', 'George', 'who', 'exact', 'opposite', 'response', 'Belvedere', 'feeling', 'decidedly', 'mutual', 'Nonetheless', 'Mr.', 'Belvedere', 'hired', 'rest', 'Classic', 'TV', 'history.Much', 'series', 'conflict', 'George', 'Mr.', 'Belvedere', 'also', 'interaction', 'stuffy', 'British', 'servant', 'Marsha', 'who', 'also', 'law', 'student', 'children', 'Wesley', 'T.', 'Owens', 'played', 'Brice', 'Beckham', 'Kevin', 'Owens', 'played', 'Rob', 'Stone', 'Heather', 'Owens', 'played', 'Tracy', 'Wells', 'Especially', 'compelling', 'relationship', 'Belvedere', 'spirited', 'wise-cracking', 'Wesley.At', 'end', 'most', 'episodes', 'Belvedere', 'seen', 'relaxing', 'room', 'evenings', 'children', 'are', 'bed', 'recording', 'everyday', 'experiences', 'diary', 'future', 'use', 'novel', 'writing', 'mid-season', 'replacement', 'series', 'premiered', 'middle', 'March', '1985', 'first', 'season', 'had', 'only', 'seven', 'episodes', 'boxed', 'set', 'episodes', 'Complete', 'Second', 'Season', 'had', '22', 'episodes.Season', 'One', 'are', 'Stranger', 'Night', 'pilot', 'characters', 'Outcasts', 'Got', 'Dance', 'Gorgeous', 'George', 'What', 'Did', 'Love', 'Lost', 'Weekend', 'Sweet', 'Charity.Season', 'Two', 'episodes', 'are', 'Lion', 'Sleeps', 'Tonight', 'Tornado', 'Cheerleader', 'Requiem', 'Delivery', 'Contract', 'Vows', 'Strike', 'Letter', 'Pinball', 'Prize', 'Speechless', 'Teacher', 'Dropout', 'Rivals', 'Wesley', 'Friend', 'Will', 'Valentine', 'Day', 'Heather', 'Tutor', 'Amish', 'Dinner', 'Two', 'Play']",Mr. Belvedere: Seasons One & Two
1220979,A3MQ672FYFNM7B,B001NPK5BU,JGC,"[0, 0]","""Mr. Belvedere"" was always one of my very favorite shows growing up. I enjoyed it because the series presented a real family with real problems in a way that was always funny and down-to-earth. The series stars the late and very talented and much-loved Christopher Hewett in the title role as Mr. Belvedere. He always offered a touch of eccentricity to the Owens family, yet he was often always the voice of reason.Wesley (Brice Beckhman) was the Bart Simpson of the '80s. He was always getting into mischief (like painting his sister's face to look like an Easter egg) and it was always Mr. Belvedere's responsibility to teach him a lesson.This is a 5-DVD set of the first 2 seasons of this classic '80s sitcom. By the way, take a look at the scan of the DVDs that I posted. Included are a total of 29 eps, these are the complete an unedited shows with the original opening and closing credits.Some of my favorite eps are probably some of yours as well:The Play - Mr. Belvedere directs Wesley's school playAmish - Kevin (Rob Stone) meets a young lady from an Amish background.The Letter - Kevin moves out on Thanksgiving Eve after harboring some hurt feelings his George's (Bob Uecker) interest in football.Also included in this set is a new interview with Ilene Graff (Marsha), Bob Uecker, Bob Stone and Brice Beckham. Tracy Wells (Heather) does not participate in the interview but she did give commentary on further sets. There is also an SNL sketch with Tom Hanks about ""Mr. Belvedere"" included on the S1/2 set.What I also love about ""Mr. Belvedere"" is that it is just so '80s. The big hair, the corny jokes, the ""Duran Duran"" references and that huge '80s style kitchen with that huge wraparound counter that I think all family sitcoms from the '80s had.The series ran for a total of 6 seasons, so far Shout! has put out the first 4. Let's hope they release the final 2 because this is one of the best family sitcoms of the '80s.",5,totally 8ighties,1301184000,"03 27, 2011",2011,1935,"['Mr.', 'Belvedere', 'was', 'always', 'one', 'very', 'favorite', 'shows', 'growing', 'up', 'enjoyed', 'series', 'presented', 'real', 'family', 'real', 'problems', 'way', 'was', 'always', 'funny', 'down-to-earth', 'series', 'late', 'very', 'talented', 'much-loved', 'Christopher', 'Hewett', 'title', 'role', 'Mr.', 'Belvedere', 'always', 'offered', 'touch', 'eccentricity', 'Owens', 'family', 'yet', 'was', 'often', 'always', 'voice', 'reason.Wesley', 'Brice', 'Beckhman', 'was', 'Bart', 'Simpson', ""'80s"", 'was', 'always', 'getting', 'mischief', 'painting', 'sister', 'face', 'look', 'Easter', 'egg', 'was', 'always', 'Mr.', 'Belvedere', 'responsibility', 'teach', 'lesson.This', '5-DVD', 'set', 'first', '2', 'seasons', 'classic', ""'80s"", 'sitcom', 'way', 'take', 'look', 'scan', 'DVDs', 'posted', 'Included', 'are', 'total', '29', 'eps', 'are', 'complete', 'unedited', 'shows', 'original', 'opening', 'closing', 'credits.Some', 'favorite', 'eps', 'are', 'probably', 'yours', 'well', 'Play', 'Mr.', 'Belvedere', 'Wesley', 'school', 'playAmish', 'Kevin', 'Rob', 'Stone', 'young', 'lady', 'Amish', 'background.The', 'Letter', 'Kevin', 'out', 'Thanksgiving', 'Eve', 'harboring', 'hurt', 'George', 'Bob', 'Uecker', 'interest', 'football.Also', 'included', 'set', 'new', 'interview', 'Ilene', 'Graff', 'Marsha', 'Bob', 'Uecker', 'Bob', 'Stone', 'Brice', 'Beckham', 'Tracy', 'Wells', 'Heather', 'not', 'participate', 'interview', 'did', 'give', 'commentary', 'further', 'sets', 'also', 'SNL', 'sketch', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'Mr.', 'Belvedere', 'included', 'S1/2', 'set.What', 'also', 'love', 'Mr.', 'Belvedere', 'just', 'so', ""'80s"", 'big', 'hair', 'corny', 'jokes', 'Duran', 'Duran', 'references', 'huge', ""'80s"", 'style', 'kitchen', 'huge', 'wraparound', 'counter', 'think', 'family', 'sitcoms', ""'80s"", 'had.The', 'series', 'ran', 'total', '6', 'seasons', 'so', 'far', 'Shout', 'put', 'out', 'first', '4', 'Let', 'hope', 'release', 'final', '2', 'one', 'best', 'family', 'sitcoms', ""'80s""]",Mr. Belvedere: Seasons One & Two

It was also a time when TV dealt with moral issues and ""Mr. Belvedere"" consistantly puts out good moral lessons.A proper Britishman comes to be the housekeeper for George and Marsha Owens, he is employed full-time, she is a full-time student in law school.  Immediately Mr. Belvedere clashes with George.  This back and forth between George and Belvedere (his first name is Lynn) is played out very well as the couple's young son Wesley (9) begins to see both as his mentors; with his Dad remaining his main concept of manhood, but with Mr. Belvedere being a unique perspective to come to for ideas and advice.The Owens also have a teenage son (17) and daughter (15).  There son is a nice enough fellow, but seems a sandwich short of a picnic much of the time.  The girl is eager to be an independent woman.  These children, too, benefit from Belvedere's reasoning skills.The series is everything television has stopped being.  There is warmth, love, characters that you wish you knew in the real world, and a tremendous amount of belly-laugh humor.  A standout espisode is ""Pinball"", one that does not show Mr. Belvedere in a good light as he becomes addicted to playing pinball and neglects his duties.  This adds realism to Mr. Belvedere because he is not a superman who never falls, but a regular person who is generally reliable, but has his weaknesses, too.This first installment features the first season (which came in as a mid-season replacement) and the entire second season.

But with a certain amount of patience and direction, I'm sure I can whip them into shape...even George. They're damn lucky to have me"".Indeed. And thanks to Shout!
