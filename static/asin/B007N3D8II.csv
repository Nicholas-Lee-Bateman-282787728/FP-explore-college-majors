1534830,A13ECO05S0YUCY,B007N3D8II,1981bendover,"[10, 10]","Thank goodness for this 8 pack Horror Collection, released by Lions Gate. Lions Gate needs to be releasing a lot more collections like this one, because these are my kind of horror movies. All of these films included in this collection were released between 1986 and 1991, which was a great era for horror movies.I first saw Waxwork many years ago, and for some reason I wasn't really into it. Watching it a second time many years laters, I really dug it. It's a fun, creative movie that has it all. There's werewolves, vampires, zombies, and mummies. The only thing it's missing is a slasher cutting people up. 4 stars out of 5.976-Evil 2 is a sequel that is slightly better than the original. It was directed by Jim Wynorski, who also directed Chopping Mall, and has decent special effects. It also has the always amusing Buck Flower in a small role. Not great, but worth seeing. 3 stars out of 5.Ghoulies 3: Ghoulies Go To College is just as silly as you'd think it would be, and I had a lot of fun while watching it. It's Animal House meets Gremlins as the ghoulies terrorize a college campus during prank week. Ghoulies II was better than Ghoulies, and I think Ghoulies 3 is a little better than Ghoulies II. It has a good bit of nudity, and some hilarious death scenes. 4 stars out of 5.The Unholy is my least favorite in this collection. It's not bad, though. It just kinds of drags, up until the fun finale, which has some scary looking demons and disturbing images. A pretty messed up movie, but I kind of liked it, and it has Hal Holbrook in it. 3 stars out of 5.C.H.U.D. 2 is another sequel that I liked better than the original. I don't remember much about the first C.H.U.D., but I do remember that I didn't care too much for it. C.H.U.D. 2, however, is an entertaining zombie spoof that is like Night of the Creeps and Return of the Living Dead 2. Norman Fell and Robert Englund both have cameos, and Robert Vaughn is a hoot! I also don't understand why it was rated R, as it has no nudity, very little language, and what little violence it does have is comedic. 4 stars out of 5.Chopping Mall is a fun movie about a robot killing people in a mall. It has some decent T & A, and some amusing cameos from Dick Miller, Mary Woronov, and Paul Bartel. 4 stars out of 5.Slaughter High is a great slasher movie that starts out like Carrie, with a high school nerd being constantly picked on. However, after that opening, it become a masked killer movie with good gore, and it is pretty scary too. 5 stars out of 5.Class of 1999 is more of an action movie than horror, but horror fans will still like it because it has gore and some scary moments. It's a fast paced and thrilling movie starring Malcolm McDowell and Pam Grier, and I liked it more than Class of 1984. 5 stars out of 5.If you are a horror fan, you should definately pick this collection up. There is something here for every horror fan.

All the films contained in this range from Excellent (Ghoulies III) to great (The Unholy, 976 Evil II) to decent (Slaughter High, Chopping Mall) quality film prints, all with great sound, however, sound could be a little muddy in a few areas, but thats no problem at all. 2 of the films in this set (C.H.U.D. II, The Unholy) are in widescreen. Whereas the others are all full-frame. Don't have a fit though, its possible they were filmed this way. Anyway, in conclusion: PICK THIS UP. An excellent collection of great films to be found in this, i wouldnt say its worth paying $50 as some people have been paying on ebay. I got mine for $15 and i'm VERY satisified with this set, as im sure you will be aswell.

As a big 80's horror fan and someone who has been known to buy some rare dvds, I had to have this collection. It contains four unreleased movies on it and the movies that had been released are pretty good as well. I searched every site to find out more about this product but came up empty handed everytime, even looking at Liongates website for information. When I found it on Ebay it was going for crazy prices but I couldnt find it on Amazon but out of the blue the product appeared and the price was pretty good considering it'll probably be 5 bucks at Wal Mart and they'll have ten or so copies of it. Anyway, Slaughter High and Class of 1999 are unrated versions. The picture is no blu ray quality but on my player that movies look brand new, 4 films per disc. Overall, if you're a horror fan you cannot go wrong with this set. I'm impatient so I had to buy it as soon as I could find it for a good deal.",4,Horror Collection,1332720000,"03 26, 2012",2012,994,"['first', 'saw', 'review', 'someone', 'was', 'doing', 'over', 'what', 'movies', 'had', 'purchased', 'big', '80', 'horror', 'fan', 'someone', 'who', 'been', 'known', 'buy', 'rare', 'dvds', 'had', 'have', 'collection', 'four', 'unreleased', 'movies', 'movies', 'had', 'been', 'released', 'are', 'pretty', 'good', 'as', 'well', 'searched', 'site', 'find', 'out', 'more', 'product', 'came', 'up', 'empty', 'handed', 'everytime', 'even', 'looking', 'Liongates', 'website', 'information', 'When', 'found', 'Ebay', 'was', 'going', 'crazy', 'prices', 'couldnt', 'find', 'Amazon', 'blue', 'product', 'appeared', 'price', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'considering', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'be', '5', 'bucks', 'Wal', 'Mart', ""'ll"", 'have', 'ten', 'so', 'copies', 'Anyway', 'Slaughter', 'High', 'Class', '1999', 'are', 'unrated', 'versions', 'picture', 'blu', 'ray', 'quality', 'player', 'movies', 'look', 'brand', 'new', '4', 'films', 'disc', 'Overall', ""'re"", 'horror', 'fan', 'can', 'not', 'go', 'wrong', 'set', ""'m"", 'impatient', 'had', 'buy', 'as', 'soon', 'could', 'find', 'good', 'deal']",N/A
1534833,A2CYV6VOL9YM0R,B007N3D8II,awesomep,"[1, 1]","There are a few good movies on this set.  Waxwork is one of my favorite.  It mixes horror with comedy, and the actors are not too bad. A wax museum comes to town in a neighborhood, which is weird from nowhere.  There are several tales created, which involve a plot to bring all the creatures to life to cause chaos on Earth.  Some teenagers visit the museum on a dare for fun and the horror begins.  It has some major actors in it like, Patrick McNee and is bloody.  Chopping Mall is another good movie, involving teenagers being slaughtered one by one by out of control robots.  Of course these movies are cheesy and fun, but enjoy anyway.

1534834,A1YXGVAKHLCL26,B007N3D8II,CryWolf854,"[7, 7]","I'm having a hard time on how Lionsgate is packaging these titles. Back when they bought out Artisan Entertainment, they obviously bought their back titles. A few words of advice : while this is a nicely put together set, a few of these movies are still available in better units.Class of 1999's unit is in Widescreen. Waxwork comes complete with its sequel. The print on Chopping Mall is in much better condition (as in the colors aren't so faded) and has Extras.  As for Slaughter High, why are we still stuck with this cheap VHS on disc copy when the U.K has an official release with a much better picture, sound, and loaded with extras?  I know fans had been waiting for this fun slasher flick for years to have it's own dvd release and felt the current ""Lost Collection"" version satisfied our wait but now it's high time to step up and give us what we truly want.  As for The Unholy, Ghoulies 3, Chud 2,  and 976-EVIL 2, the prints are excellent and it's about time that we can finally see them preserved on disc. My only questions are what took them so long and why wasn't The Unholy and Chud 2 ever released in Region 1 when all you did was get the prints off the Region 2 discs?  And are we going to see Class of 1999: The Substitute get a DVD release as well in another set?",3,Some FYI Before You Buy,1341446400,"07 5, 2012",2012,1283,"[""'m"", 'having', 'hard', 'time', 'how', 'Lionsgate', 'packaging', 'titles', 'Back', 'when', 'bought', 'out', 'Artisan', 'Entertainment', 'obviously', 'bought', 'back', 'titles', 'few', 'words', 'advice', 'nicely', 'put', 'together', 'set', 'few', 'movies', 'are', 'still', 'available', 'better', 'units.Class', '1999', 'unit', 'Widescreen', 'Waxwork', 'complete', 'sequel', 'print', 'Chopping', 'Mall', 'much', 'better', 'condition', 'colors', 'are', ""n't"", 'so', 'faded', 'Extras', 'Slaughter', 'High', 'why', 'are', 'still', 'stuck', 'cheap', 'VHS', 'disc', 'copy', 'when', 'U.K', 'official', 'release', 'much', 'better', 'picture', 'sound', 'loaded', 'extras', 'know', 'fans', 'had', 'been', 'waiting', 'fun', 'flick', 'years', 'have', 'own', 'dvd', 'release', 'felt', 'current', 'Lost', 'Collection', 'version', 'satisfied', 'wait', 'now', 'high', 'time', 'step', 'up', 'give', 'what', 'truly', 'want', 'Unholy', 'Ghoulies', '3', 'Chud', '2', '976-EVIL', '2', 'prints', 'are', 'excellent', 'time', 'can', 'finally', 'see', 'preserved', 'disc', 'only', 'questions', 'are', 'what', 'took', 'so', 'long', 'why', 'was', ""n't"", 'Unholy', 'Chud', '2', 'ever', 'released', 'Region', '1', 'when', 'did', 'was', 'get', 'prints', 'Region', '2', 'discs', 'are', 'going', 'see', 'Class', '1999', 'Substitute', 'get', 'DVD', 'release', 'as', 'well', 'set']",N/A
