All Christians should see How Great Is Our God to just be encouraged about how BIG our GOD is. Also non-Christian will find it inspiring as a evangelistic tool as he goes into a lot of science to prove that there is no doubt that God created all things.  Amazing! I've seen it several times and still shout and weep at how Great GOD's LOVE is for me. Leaves you feeling and knowing that GOD is greater than we can possibly begin to understand. HE IS big enough for any problem we have. Give this as a gift. It will change lives and be a blessing!",5,PERFECT GIFT!!,1327881600,"01 30, 2012",2012,635,"[""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'Louie', 'Giglio', 'Live', 'YouTube', 'DVD', 'know', 'Christians', 'should', 'see', 'How', 'Great', 'God', 'just', 'be', 'encouraged', 'how', 'BIG', 'GOD', 'Also', 'non-Christian', 'will', 'find', 'inspiring', 'evangelistic', 'tool', 'lot', 'science', 'prove', 'doubt', 'God', 'created', 'things', 'Amazing', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'several', 'times', 'still', 'shout', 'weep', 'how', 'Great', 'GOD', 'LOVE', 'feeling', 'knowing', 'GOD', 'greater', 'can', 'possibly', 'begin', 'understand', 'HE', 'big', 'enough', 'problem', 'have', 'Give', 'gift', 'will', 'change', 'lives', 'be', 'blessing']",N/A

Kennel ""33joy""","[7, 7]","Very quick review:  these two video presentations are about 45-60 minutes each and are great for showing to people who do not believe in God or don't know what they believe about God.  The presentations are very good for the Christmas season, and for this price it is the best deal around.Personally, the 12 Words dvd was my least favorite of Louie Giglio's, but the How Great Is Our God presentation still gives me the chills every time I watch it.  I am definitely considering buying this package for Christmas gifts for a number of people, Christians and non-Christians.Great encouragement for anyone, and we all need that.
