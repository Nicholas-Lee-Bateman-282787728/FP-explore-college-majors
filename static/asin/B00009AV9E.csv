I tend to keep my expectations low and am therefore often very pleasantly surprised by those indie gems that come along.  This film is definitely not in that category.

753535,A328S9RN3U5M68,B00009AV9E,Grady Harp,"[4, 5]","Jeff London ('Regarding Billy') seems to be a director and writer who is committed to investigating the various degrees of problems young gay men face as they live in a homophobic society. His films resound with an honest feeling but too often he settles for stereotypes at both ends of the spectrum and that tends to weaken his work.The setting is a Bible College somewhere in America where hunky Paul (Ron Petronicolos) is entering his 'last year' of study, his summer having been disrupted by an incident that is revealed later in the story.  He re-joins his longtime roommate Robby (Patrick Orion Hoesterey) but keeps asking about his good friend Hector (Merrick McMahon), a subject no one wants to address.  He meets Hector's roommate Alex (Mike Dolan) and gradually Alex lets Paul know that he is gay.  Paul learns that the Bible College has discovered Hector is gay and the Dean (Rand Smith) and his henchmen are out to have Hector expelled.  Paul's changed ways are noted by Robby and he finally confides that his summer incident was a gay experience in a restroom - a fact that Robby finds repulsive at first but soon comes to support Paul's anguish about his parent's disapproval and punishment.As Paul's feelings for living who he really is surface he finds solace and sanctuary with Alex and the two become lovers.  The Dean's spies gradually intimidate the group of four (Paul, Alex, Hector and Robby) and disciplinary action is taken.  Among Paul's discoveries in his rebellion against the Bible College's stance against gays is the fact that the dean is a closet case and that is the reason for the rough action against Hector (with whom the dean had an assignation).  It all comes to a tragic end for some and a sense of freedom for others - to find out who belongs to which category requires watching the film!The movie has its moments, due largely to the ability of the actors Petronicolos, Dolan, and McMahon, but it sadly is buried by otherwise mediocre to poor acting from the rest of the cast. The work of Rand Smith, Penelope Ma (who plays the dean's wife), and Lawrence Rinzel (who plays Paul's father) is particularly weak just when strong acting could have supported the flimsier portions of the script.  London needed to spend more thought on Bible Colleges, finding that more razor sharp line between right wing bias against  gays instead of opting for the usual clich?s that are found everywhere.  That dividing line among young men challenged by sexual identity would have made a far more successful film.  But the film is worth watching for the performances of the three lead actors - strong young men each!

There is too much going on in this overlong movie and many unnecessary and underdeveloped characters which muddy up the central story and theme.  Some of the peripheral actors are really bad.  Some of the dialog is really forced.  (Some of it actually made me squirm.)Now the good.  The principal young men in this film are great.

It's about acceptance and finding out who you are.  I rented the moviea, and I like it so much that I decided to purchase the movie from Amazon.  The acting was very good. I really liked Mike Dolan and Merrick McMahon.  I was not bored at all with The Last Year. It raises a lot of very important questions about being gay and religious beliefs.  I think Mike Dolan is a very talented actor and very handsome too. :).  I receommend this movie to anyone that appreciates great storytelling.",4,Better than I expected,1259884800,"12 4, 2009",2009,578,"['really', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'Last', 'Year', 'found', 'be', 'very', 'intelligent', 'gay', 'movie', 'acceptance', 'finding', 'out', 'who', 'are', 'rented', 'moviea', 'like', 'so', 'much', 'decided', 'purchase', 'movie', 'Amazon', 'acting', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'really', 'liked', 'Mike', 'Dolan', 'Merrick', 'McMahon', 'was', 'not', 'bored', 'Last', 'Year', 'lot', 'very', 'important', 'questions', 'being', 'gay', 'religious', 'beliefs', 'think', 'Mike', 'Dolan', 'very', 'talented', 'actor', 'very', 'handsome', 'too', 'receommend', 'movie', 'anyone', 'great', 'storytelling']",The Last Year
