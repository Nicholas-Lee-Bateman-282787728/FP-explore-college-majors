1280241,A3ROE64EVHDTTV,B002NUULNG,"AMP ""Al""","[13, 14]","Movie:  4.5/5  Video Quality:  4.5/5  Audio Quality:  5/5  Extras:  2.5/5  Overall:  4.1/5 (rounded down in total star ranking)This was the second genuine anime film I ever watched, and even after repeated viewings I've been confused and confounded by it.  It may be short and it may boast some cool action scenes, but for the most part it is a tight, complex, and highly cerebral thriller.  The combination of philosophy, psychology, technology, and politics is often overwhelming in this film.Only recently have I been able to understand the movie's plot and issues, and I must say that it is a very sublime picture with some very deep issues concerning the human soul, technology, and society.  For that matter, each viewing does reveal deeper meaning.  On this basis, the movie not only makes for quintessential anime, but it is also an essential (and influential) piece of cyberpunk sci-fi.The movie's plot and characters may seem muddled, but they have nuances and complexities of their own.  I do find that other features in the ""Ghost in the Shell"" series (namely, ""Innocence,"" ""Stand Alone Complex,"" and ""Solid State Society"") offer easier storylines and more understandable characters, but they are not quite as original or distinctive as what's in this film.  The movie is slowly-paced, but has lots of interesting visuals and some brilliant action scenes.  Production design features some very interesting and original sets, props, costumes, vehicles, and weapons.  Music is interesting.For better or for worse, this disc showcases the 2.0 version, which offers enhanced CGI effects to replace certain scenes, as well as an enhanced soundtrack and a new music score.  These changes do offer a different color palette than the theatrical cut, and the image overall looks cleaner, sharper, and more detailed.  Above all, it is visually and conceptually more compatible with other features in the ""Ghost in the Shell"" series.This disc offers decent quality.  The video looks very clean, with excellent color and contrast.  It is sharp with plenty of details; textures are strong and pencil lines are thin.  I saw no signs of visual noise, pixilation, or aliasing.  The only issue worth noting is that some scenes may have bright auras, but this is notably less intrusive on Blu-Ray than it is on DVD.  A few scenes showed some slight banding as well.  Sound quality is excellent (DTS-HD MA 6.1, lossless), and you have a choice between English dubbing and the original Japanese, with optional subtitles.  Extras include a making-of feature, character profiles, creator biographies, and a trailer.One of the special features is the original theatrical cut of the movie.  Video quality on the original film in 1080i is notably weaker, for it shows greater pixilation, aliasing, and film artifacts.  Colors are also more washed-out, but some colors are notably different than the 2.0 version (more blues and greens in certain scenes).  Regardless, it is still a sharp and clean image.  Sound quality is good, and it has the same language and subtitle options as the 2.0 feature.",4,"""All data that exists is both reality and fantasy.""",1261094400,"12 18, 2009",2009,3084,"['Movie', '4.5/5', 'Video', 'Quality', '4.5/5', 'Audio', 'Quality', '5/5', 'Extras', '2.5/5', 'Overall', '4.1/5', 'rounded', 'down', 'total', 'star', 'ranking', 'was', 'second', 'genuine', 'anime', 'film', 'ever', 'watched', 'even', 'repeated', 'viewings', ""'ve"", 'been', 'confused', 'confounded', 'may', 'be', 'short', 'may', 'boast', 'cool', 'action', 'scenes', 'most', 'part', 'tight', 'complex', 'highly', 'cerebral', 'thriller', 'combination', 'philosophy', 'psychology', 'technology', 'politics', 'often', 'overwhelming', 'film.Only', 'recently', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'understand', 'movie', 'plot', 'issues', 'must', 'say', 'very', 'sublime', 'picture', 'very', 'deep', 'issues', 'concerning', 'human', 'soul', 'technology', 'society', 'matter', 'viewing', 'reveal', 'deeper', 'meaning', 'basis', 'movie', 'not', 'only', 'quintessential', 'anime', 'also', 'essential', 'influential', 'piece', 'cyberpunk', 'sci-fi.The', 'movie', 'plot', 'characters', 'may', 'seem', 'muddled', 'have', 'nuances', 'complexities', 'own', 'do', 'find', 'other', 'features', 'Ghost', 'Shell', 'series', 'namely', 'Innocence', 'Stand', 'Alone', 'Complex', 'Solid', 'State', 'Society', 'offer', 'easier', 'storylines', 'more', 'understandable', 'characters', 'are', 'not', 'quite', 'original', 'distinctive', 'what', 'film', 'movie', 'slowly-paced', 'lots', 'interesting', 'visuals', 'brilliant', 'action', 'scenes', 'Production', 'design', 'very', 'interesting', 'original', 'sets', 'props', 'costumes', 'vehicles', 'weapons', 'Music', 'interesting.For', 'better', 'worse', 'disc', '2.0', 'version', 'enhanced', 'CGI', 'effects', 'replace', 'certain', 'scenes', 'as', 'well', 'enhanced', 'soundtrack', 'new', 'music', 'score', 'changes', 'do', 'offer', 'different', 'color', 'palette', 'theatrical', 'cut', 'image', 'overall', 'cleaner', 'sharper', 'more', 'detailed', 'visually', 'conceptually', 'more', 'compatible', 'other', 'features', 'Ghost', 'Shell', 'series.This', 'disc', 'offers', 'decent', 'quality', 'video', 'very', 'clean', 'excellent', 'color', 'contrast', 'sharp', 'plenty', 'details', 'textures', 'are', 'strong', 'pencil', 'lines', 'are', 'thin', 'saw', 'signs', 'visual', 'noise', 'pixilation', 'aliasing', 'only', 'issue', 'noting', 'scenes', 'may', 'have', 'bright', 'auras', 'notably', 'less', 'intrusive', 'Blu-Ray', 'DVD', 'A', 'few', 'scenes', 'showed', 'slight', 'banding', 'as', 'well', 'Sound', 'quality', 'excellent', 'DTS-HD', 'MA', '6.1', 'lossless', 'have', 'choice', 'English', 'dubbing', 'original', 'Japanese', 'optional', 'subtitles', 'Extras', 'include', 'making-of', 'feature', 'character', 'profiles', 'creator', 'biographies', 'trailer.One', 'special', 'features', 'original', 'theatrical', 'cut', 'movie', 'Video', 'quality', 'original', 'film', '1080i', 'notably', 'weaker', 'greater', 'pixilation', 'aliasing', 'film', 'artifacts', 'Colors', 'are', 'also', 'more', 'washed-out', 'colors', 'are', 'notably', 'different', '2.0', 'version', 'more', 'blues', 'greens', 'certain', 'scenes', 'Regardless', 'still', 'sharp', 'clean', 'image', 'Sound', 'quality', 'good', 'same', 'language', 'subtitle', 'options', '2.0', 'feature']",N/A

Is it a remastered addition with extra scenes or extra behind the scenes? Or is it an entirely different movie?Well its the Ghost in a Shell original movie. It has nothing the original dvd version didn't have. Why does it say 2.0? I guess because its remastered for blu ray version? I really didn't see any differences from the dvd version to this version, other then that it plays on a blu ray player and not a dvd player.Even the one behind the scenes option, was something the original dvd version had included previously and nothing new. But if u want the movie in the blu ray option, I supposed this is the way to go. I just wish they didnt try to confuse people by adding the 2.0 to the title, making u think it might be some other movie, maybe even the ghost in a shell 2 movie that DOES exist, which this is not.So in the end, its the ghost in a shell movie (first one), with only ONE behind the scene option (which was with the original dvd version previously), and a blu ray option.

To flop back and forth between animation and CGI is a bit strange, and honestly unexpected.

1280246,A30JPZ9TZ7I61U,B002NUULNG,"Christopher Barrett ""Evil Corgi""","[2, 3]","I own three versions of this film: the Special Edition DVD Ghost in the Shell (Ghost in the Shell (Special Edition)), the original DVD release (Ghost in the Shell) and this version, the 2.0 Blu-Ray release.  There are some flaws with the Blu-Ray, but they mainly have to do with it not being such a 'special' release.  But being a huge fan, I can't help but purchase each re-release!The HD transfer was very well done, and most of the CG 'updating' was just replacing the old mid 90s CG with some newer CG so it doesn't look so outdated.  I don't have a problem with that as long as they aren't doing the 'George Lucas treatment' by adding in whole new scenes.  But replacing a rather dated looking CG helicopter with a newer CG rendering is not a deal breaker in my opinion.  Other than that, there are some 'tweaks' to the resolution.  Nothing that really changes anything, but along the lines of when someone like Criterion takes an old film from the 30s or 40s and cleans the resolution for newer digital formats.  You don't feel like you're watching a VHS film 'copied' onto a DVD like many of the DVD re-releases of 90s anime.  Instead you feel like watching an animation that had been intended to be digital all along.The audio is the best and most noticeable improvement over the DVD.  The score has been remastered and the Japanese voice acting completely re-done.  And for the better in my opinion.  The new voice acting is terrific.  I have listened to it briefly with the English dubbing, but I feel the Japanese voice acting lends a more serious and authentic tone to this film.So basically with the new and updated resolution and sound you aren't really watching the 'original' film.  Just the plot and basic settings remain the same.  Upon watching the oldest version I have (the original DVD release) you really see the improvements made.Would I recommend purchasing this version?  Yes.  I wouldn't say it's the purest version (the original DVD takes that honor, since it is the exact version that was released in theaters in Japan and later onto VHS - which I used to own! But tossed since I don't have a VHS anymore).  But this is probably the 'best' version of the actual film.  There aren't really too many extras sadly.  The DVD Special Edition seemed to have more.  But for a very high quality version with improved voice acting and sound, this is a winner.  If you haven't seen the previous versions, this is a worthy place to start.  If you are a purist, then you probably won't like this version.  But if you can accept what the studio was attempting, then you can appreciate this version.If you don't know Ghost in the Shell... what it refers to is an artificial intelligence becoming sentient in an artificial body.  Basically the 'ghost' is a person's soul.  The shell is the prosthetic or artificial body.  In the near future humans have the ability to transfer their brain into prosthetic bodies.  The brain retains their soul or 'ghost'.  Not everyone has the ability or funds to accomplish this, so the vast majority of people are still in their original bodies.  But many (most) people have wired implants to allow them to be online in a kind of virtual net.  Eerie!The plot here begins when a prosthetic body acquires a 'ghost' or at least is thought to have.  Enter the Puppet Master.  So section 9, a kind of cyber police special force, gets assigned to the case.  So the team starts to unravel the plot and ends up crossing into dangerous territory.  The lines between right and wrong, friend and foe, and good and evil become blurred.  The film raises tons of philosophical questions.  Despite some scenes with a somewhat slower pace and lots of conversation (such as near the end), it never comes off as boring.  The finale is very well done and the ending is very well done. (No spoilers!)This is a very cerebral film, and one that encourages thought and reflection.  It is also rewarding of multiple viewings.  Each time I watch it I notice something a little extra, or at least it gives me pause to think.The film and the new HD transfer I give 5 stars.  For special features and extras I give two stars!",5,"Great Blu-Ray transfer, new Japanese audio, not many special features though ~",1262908800,"01 8, 2010",2010,4146,"['own', 'three', 'versions', 'film', 'Special', 'Edition', 'DVD', 'Ghost', 'Shell', 'Ghost', 'Shell', 'Special', 'Edition', 'original', 'DVD', 'release', 'Ghost', 'Shell', 'version', '2.0', 'Blu-Ray', 'release', 'are', 'flaws', 'Blu-Ray', 'mainly', 'have', 'do', 'not', 'being', 'such', ""'special"", 'release', 'being', 'huge', 'fan', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'purchase', 're-release', 'HD', 'transfer', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'most', 'CG', ""'updating"", 'was', 'just', 'replacing', 'old', 'mid', '90s', 'CG', 'newer', 'CG', ""n't"", 'look', 'so', 'outdated', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'problem', 'as', 'long', 'are', ""n't"", 'doing', ""'George"", 'Lucas', 'treatment', 'adding', 'whole', 'new', 'scenes', 'replacing', 'rather', 'dated', 'looking', 'CG', 'helicopter', 'newer', 'CG', 'rendering', 'not', 'deal', 'breaker', 'opinion', 'Other', 'are', ""'tweaks"", 'resolution', 'Nothing', 'really', 'anything', 'lines', 'when', 'someone', 'Criterion', 'old', 'film', '30s', '40s', 'resolution', 'newer', 'digital', 'formats', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', ""'re"", 'watching', 'VHS', 'film', ""'copied"", 'DVD', 'many', 'DVD', 're-releases', '90s', 'anime', 'Instead', 'feel', 'watching', 'animation', 'had', 'been', 'intended', 'be', 'digital', 'along.The', 'audio', 'best', 'most', 'noticeable', 'improvement', 'DVD', 'score', 'been', 'remastered', 'Japanese', 'voice', 'acting', 'completely', 're-done', 'better', 'opinion', 'new', 'voice', 'acting', 'terrific', 'have', 'listened', 'briefly', 'English', 'dubbing', 'feel', 'Japanese', 'voice', 'acting', 'more', 'serious', 'authentic', 'tone', 'film.So', 'basically', 'new', 'updated', 'resolution', 'sound', 'are', ""n't"", 'really', 'watching', ""'original"", 'film', 'Just', 'plot', 'basic', 'settings', 'remain', 'same', 'watching', 'oldest', 'version', 'have', 'original', 'DVD', 'release', 'really', 'see', 'improvements', 'made.Would', 'recommend', 'purchasing', 'version', 'Yes', 'would', ""n't"", 'say', 'purest', 'version', 'original', 'DVD', 'honor', 'exact', 'version', 'was', 'released', 'theaters', 'Japan', 'later', 'VHS', 'used', 'own', 'tossed', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'VHS', 'anymore', 'probably', ""'best"", 'version', 'actual', 'film', 'are', ""n't"", 'really', 'too', 'many', 'extras', 'sadly', 'DVD', 'Special', 'Edition', 'seemed', 'have', 'more', 'very', 'high', 'quality', 'version', 'improved', 'voice', 'acting', 'sound', 'winner', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'previous', 'versions', 'worthy', 'place', 'start', 'are', 'purist', 'then', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'like', 'version', 'can', 'accept', 'what', 'studio', 'was', 'attempting', 'then', 'can', 'appreciate', 'version.If', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Ghost', 'Shell', 'what', 'artificial', 'intelligence', 'becoming', 'sentient', 'artificial', 'body', 'Basically', ""'ghost"", 'person', 'soul', 'shell', 'prosthetic', 'artificial', 'body', 'near', 'future', 'humans', 'have', 'ability', 'transfer', 'brain', 'prosthetic', 'bodies', 'brain', 'soul', 'Not', 'everyone', 'ability', 'funds', 'accomplish', 'vast', 'majority', 'people', 'are', 'still', 'original', 'bodies', 'many', 'most', 'people', 'have', 'wired', 'implants', 'allow', 'be', 'online', 'kind', 'virtual', 'net', 'Eerie', 'plot', 'here', 'when', 'prosthetic', 'body', ""'ghost"", 'least', 'thought', 'have', 'Enter', 'Puppet', 'Master', 'So', 'section', '9', 'kind', 'cyber', 'police', 'special', 'force', 'assigned', 'case', 'team', 'unravel', 'plot', 'up', 'crossing', 'dangerous', 'territory', 'lines', 'right', 'wrong', 'friend', 'foe', 'good', 'evil', 'become', 'blurred', 'film', 'tons', 'philosophical', 'questions', 'scenes', 'somewhat', 'slower', 'pace', 'lots', 'conversation', 'such', 'end', 'never', 'off', 'boring', 'finale', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'ending', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'spoilers', 'very', 'cerebral', 'film', 'one', 'thought', 'reflection', 'also', 'rewarding', 'multiple', 'viewings', 'time', 'watch', 'notice', 'something', 'little', 'extra', 'least', 'think.The', 'film', 'new', 'HD', 'transfer', 'give', '5', 'stars', 'special', 'features', 'extras', 'give', 'two', 'stars']",N/A

Not since Akira did an animated featurego beyond its boundries and become a solid classic sci-fi masterpiece.  My jaw dropped during the openingtitle sequence ( those green cascading numbers turning into letters have long since been ripped off (borrowed/homaged)  bythe Matrix trilogy).Now skip forward 14 years later to V2.0Cons:1.Not sure what the revision was about,  It certainly doesn't add to the power of the original.They added in modern CG to replace the most memorable shots.  Transition is like goingfrom salt water to fresh water,  a bit jarring.  I suggest a V3.0 and fully render the entirenarrative.  With the technology in full swing and past rendered features such as Appleseedand Final Fantasy,  its a shame that a full rendered treatment wasn't applied to the entire feature.2.The overall color of the feature has gone from that greenish/blue tint to a yellowish goldentint to better match the new CG.3.

As noted by others, the changes to the original film are not earth-shattering, and they aren't all improvements.New computer generated 3D animation is substituted for some of the old cell animation. But the transitions are jarring. The change is hard to justify. The old animation was good, and the style was more or less consistent.I personally think the English dubbing should have been re-done. Just something about the Major's voice has always been a little too deadpan. But basically the same old voice tracks are used.The color of the whole film is shifted toward sepia. Everything is more washed-out and more brown than before. It doesn't look good to me.I bought the 12"" laserdisc of GITS when it came out. The first DVD release of GITS was quite good.

Mamoru Oshii, director of Sky Crawlers and Patlabor pioneered anime sci-fi in the 90s with this film adaptation of Masamune Shirow's manga series.Set in a future where androids and cyborgs are commonplace, a special Japanese enforcer unit called Section 9 gets called into handle cybercrimes and sticky foreign affairs. Matoko is a major on this team, and she and her partner Batou get called into handling a case on the illusive hacker known as the Puppet Master. After trailing some unsuspecting garbage collectors, they think they have their man, but he turns out to be another puppet himself. Then, a robot body escapes from a government cybernetics lab, and is brought into Section 9 headquarters. Two agents from the rival Section 6 show up to claim it saying that was now hosting the cybernetic essence referred to as a ""ghost"" of the Puppet Master. It reveals itself to be a living entity that was created by Section 6 to control people's ghosts, and its come to Section 9 seeking asylum. Commandos make off with the body, so Matoko and Batou take off after their getaway car. Matoko corners them in an abandonned church, although the car is protected by a robot spider tank(not a Tachikoma, BTW). She almost gets crushed by the tank, but Batou manages to stop it with a bigass gun. Matoko then dives into the Puppet Master, and he reveals to her that arranged all this in attempt to merge his programming with her ghost in order to create an entirely new lifeform. Matoko doesn't get a chance to disagree as both she and the Puppet Master's body's are totalled by Section 6 agents. Hours later, Batou was able to salvage what there was of Matoko's ghost into the robot body of a young girl, although she claims she is now longer Matoko or the Puppet Master, but their composite prodigy. She then leaves planning to spread herself throughout the net.This movie was one of the few to actually be released in U.S. theatres in the 90s. The blend of computer graphics with Oshii's dynamic animation direction is superb. It's influence is apparent in several other American productions like Batman Beyond, The Matrix and Equilibrium. The film itself spawned off a sequal, Ghost In The Shell: Innocence, plus the Stand Alone Complex anime TV series which has a movie followup and two compilation movies. The original was recently redone in a new version, Ghost In The Shell 2.0, which is the same film, but now with new 3D graphics which add a definate bonus to it, and not in some lame Star Wars: Special Edition way. The dub is pretty good, although most U.S. otaku probably ally themselves with the English cast from the TV series instead.

1280261,A3G7BE8K0E2J9P,B002NUULNG,Jose Argumedo,"[111, 120]","Ahh...Ghost in the Shell. The 1995 movie based on the manga that was called by some the second coming of Akira. I can't help but agree with that. So here we are almost 15 years later and we now have a sequel, a spin-off TV show, with a TV movie and it's influence is seen in movies such as ""The Matrix."" Now we have GitS 2.0, which is not a sequel (though I can see why people could be misled into thinking that.) but a redone version of the first movie. The colors has been changed and some CG has been brought in to replace the old animation. Its supposed to look more like the sequel, ""Innocence,"" but honestly it looks weird since the original movie was made 9 years before the sequel. But I'm not going to review the movie itself, I'm just going to tell you why you should buy this on Blu-Ray.The first thing all you purists need to know, the original Ghost in the Shell is included on the disc in HD. It doesn't look that great but it looks better than the DVD for sure. Also, the transfer is not the DVD master from the 2005 re-issue simply upconverted (contrary to popular belief), it is the Blu-ray master from Japan. They didn't really clean up the film but this is pretty much the best it's ever going to look unless Bandai, Manga or Production IG want to put up the money for a full re-master.Which brings us into the new 2.0 version. This puppy has demo worthy video. The animation has been nicely cleaned-up, the new CG pops, and the re-mixed soundtrack (which I'll get back to in a minute) can bring the house down. This is one of the best animated Blu-rays out there, up there with ""Cars,"" ""Wall-E,"" and ""Akira."" While consistency is off thanks to the new CG, new colors and old animation, but this is not the fault of the transfer.The soundtrack for the original Japanese version has actually been thrown out the window completely. Not only are there new sound effects, but the original cast has re-recorded all their lines, with one exception: the Puppet Master. The Puppet Master was originally voiced by a man, and has now been replaced by a woman. Also the song that plays in the background during the market chase with Batou has been removed. It is such a small thing that people probably won't notice (but I brought it up for a reason).Now, I'm going to be honest, I'm a fan of the English dub of GitS in all of its forms. When this was announced I thought for sure they would re-dub the movie with the new GitS: Stand Alone Complex cast. This is not the case. They used the original dub from 1995 for this version (So Mimi Woods is playing Motoko, not  Mary Elizabeth McGlynn from the SAC dub.) with the new sound effects thrown in. Which brings us to a inconsistency because in the 2.0 version the Puppet Master is supposed to be played a female, but instead, is still played by a man, since this is literally the same dub. This isn't the only inconsistency, the song from the marketplace is now back in the movie. There some other small gripes but only the hardcore fan would notice.Now onto the extras. They consider the old version of the movie as a extra, and it is a pretty cool extra, having both versions in HD. Then we come into a couple of weird quirks. On the box, it says there is a commentary with the director, as well as a making of feature for 2.0. What we get is a making of feature....for the original movie and a theatrical trailer...for the original. Along with come bios and glossary. The features on the box are no where to be found, which is quite a big gaff. Maybe future re-prints will correct this but as of now, the features on the box are not there. To me, it isn't a big deal, but it kind of sucks that we don't get what the box promises.All in all this is a must buy for every GitS fan. Not only do you get the new version of this movie, you get the original in HD. That way, you get the best of both worlds.

1280266,A2ARDVMUGDFED6,B002NUULNG,MiRSD,"[1, 1]","First of all - props to Anchor Bay/Starz for bringing this title out at a very reasonable price. Most Anime Blu-Rays tend to retail at 2-3 times what a ""hollywood"" movie do (Bandai, I'm looking at you!) - Anchor Bay released this at a fraction of what a hollywood movie costs (it tends to go on sale often, but even at its retail price it's a great bargain!)On to the disc though.Ghost in the Shell - it seems to go along with Akira as most peoples' first introductions to anime and still stands up today as a great movie. I'm not so great at going into the plot points of movies, so I usually leave that to the other reviewers. Overall I still love this movie.Rather than a straight ""clean up"" on the movie, the creators went back and basically re-did a lot of it. This is done either by new computer drawn-animation (similar to Stand Alone Complex) or by adding CG. While the original does show its age in some of the CG used at the time, and it was nice to see that cleaned up with some modern graphics, I found the choices in switching animation styles throughout camera cuts to be odd. You'll see classic hand-drawn animation one second, then crisp computer-drawn animation the next, then CG models the next, then back to hand-drawn. They don't do a terrible job of pulling it off, but it's very obvious. The characters themselves ""look"" different from cut to cut, and while the CG looks great as a background it looks odd when the characters are CG models (everything looks very flat, almost amateurish but with very nice shading - hard to describe). I liked watching the 2.0 cut, but I still love the original.As for the Blu-Ray itself:Video was obviously very nice for the 2.0 version - everything was cleaned up nicely or recreated to give it a very crisp look. No flaws that I could notice.Audio was also very good - if you have a nice audio system it'll make nice use of it!Extras were perhaps the best part.. the original GitS movie! While quality isn't the greatest (I didn't notice much of a difference between the DVD release and this 1080i version), it's fantastic that they included it. Best part, it's cheaper to get this package than it is to buy GitS separately on DVD! Other extras were alright, but nothing outstanding.Overall a very nice bundle at a great price. Ghost in the Shell + Ghost in the Shell 2.0 with great video and audio. If you don't own GitS already, pick this one up! If you did and are curious to check out 2.0, it's cheap enough that you can buy the disc and not invest much money into it.To make it a 5 star disc, I would've liked to see some more effort put into 2.0 (the CG models were a bit ""iffy"", same goes for the blending of all 3 styles of animation), GitS (original) could have been cleaned up much nicer, and it would've been great to see some behind the scenes on the 2.0 version (maybe even an in-movie-experience letting you see both versions side by side?).",4,"(BLU-RAY Review) An interesting ""remix"" of GitS but overall a nice set.",1276905600,"06 19, 2010",2010,2913,"['First', 'props', 'Anchor', 'Bay/Starz', 'bringing', 'title', 'out', 'very', 'reasonable', 'price', 'Most', 'Anime', 'Blu-Rays', 'tend', 'retail', '2-3', 'times', 'what', 'hollywood', 'movie', 'do', 'Bandai', ""'m"", 'looking', 'Anchor', 'Bay', 'released', 'fraction', 'what', 'hollywood', 'movie', 'costs', 'go', 'sale', 'often', 'even', 'retail', 'price', 'great', 'bargain', 'disc', 'though.Ghost', 'Shell', 'go', 'along', 'Akira', 'most', 'peoples', 'first', 'introductions', 'anime', 'still', 'up', 'today', 'great', 'movie', ""'m"", 'not', 'so', 'great', 'going', 'plot', 'points', 'movies', 'usually', 'leave', 'other', 'reviewers', 'Overall', 'still', 'love', 'movie.Rather', 'straight', 'clean', 'up', 'movie', 'creators', 'went', 'back', 'basically', 're-did', 'lot', 'done', 'either', 'new', 'computer', 'drawn-animation', 'similar', 'Stand', 'Alone', 'Complex', 'adding', 'CG', 'original', 'show', 'age', 'CG', 'used', 'time', 'was', 'nice', 'see', 'cleaned', 'up', 'modern', 'graphics', 'found', 'choices', 'switching', 'animation', 'styles', 'camera', 'cuts', 'be', 'odd', ""'ll"", 'see', 'classic', 'hand-drawn', 'animation', 'one', 'second', 'then', 'computer-drawn', 'animation', 'next', 'then', 'CG', 'models', 'next', 'then', 'back', 'hand-drawn', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'terrible', 'job', 'pulling', 'off', 'very', 'obvious', 'characters', 'look', 'different', 'cut', 'cut', 'CG', 'great', 'background', 'odd', 'when', 'characters', 'are', 'CG', 'models', 'everything', 'very', 'flat', 'almost', 'amateurish', 'very', 'nice', 'shading', 'hard', 'describe', 'liked', 'watching', '2.0', 'cut', 'still', 'love', 'original.As', 'Blu-Ray', 'Video', 'was', 'obviously', 'very', 'nice', '2.0', 'version', 'everything', 'was', 'cleaned', 'up', 'nicely', 'recreated', 'give', 'very', 'crisp', 'look', 'No', 'flaws', 'could', 'notice.Audio', 'was', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'have', 'nice', 'audio', 'system', ""'ll"", 'make', 'nice', 'use', 'Extras', 'were', 'perhaps', 'best', 'part..', 'original', 'GitS', 'movie', 'quality', ""n't"", 'greatest', 'did', ""n't"", 'notice', 'much', 'difference', 'DVD', 'release', '1080i', 'version', 'fantastic', 'included', 'Best', 'part', 'cheaper', 'get', 'package', 'buy', 'GitS', 'separately', 'DVD', 'Other', 'extras', 'were', 'alright', 'nothing', 'outstanding.Overall', 'very', 'nice', 'bundle', 'great', 'price', 'Ghost', 'Shell', '+', 'Ghost', 'Shell', '2.0', 'great', 'video', 'audio', 'do', ""n't"", 'own', 'GitS', 'already', 'pick', 'one', 'up', 'did', 'are', 'curious', 'check', 'out', '2.0', 'cheap', 'enough', 'can', 'buy', 'disc', 'not', 'invest', 'much', 'money', 'it.To', 'make', '5', 'star', 'disc', 'would', ""'ve"", 'liked', 'see', 'more', 'effort', 'put', '2.0', 'CG', 'models', 'were', 'bit', 'iffy', 'same', 'blending', '3', 'styles', 'animation', 'GitS', 'original', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'cleaned', 'up', 'much', 'nicer', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'great', 'see', 'scenes', '2.0', 'version', 'maybe', 'even', 'in-movie-experience', 'letting', 'see', 'versions', 'side', 'side']",N/A

And ears. I remember putting the film's audio on a cassette tape years ago so I could listen to it at work and in my car.. it was one of the first anime I remember that had a brilliant ambient score that drenched the film in a really eerie stoic mood. The remastered Skywalker sound soundtrack and effects track are a total joy to me, the music's dynamic range is captured better than ever, and a plethora of miscellaneous background effects flesh out the action better than ever.In nearly every scene, the colors look deeper and more genuine than the original print.. there is alot more simulated depth of field, not only from newly inserted visuals, but just from some clever color and contrast tweaks.And NO, I have no qualms with the added CGI elements. Mamoru Oshii approved all of them, and Oshii's ever reiterated themes in the series has always been disassociation, dehumanization and the philosophy of making dolls in human form... so for this viewer, having a few scenes where Major Kusanagi is re-visualized in an even more stylized and antiseptic digital shape doesn't bother me at all. It's the whole point of her character.The cropping that appears in some shots bothered me a little, but I get the feeling this wasn't done because it looked good, but because there wasn't another way to fix or alter color timing in the frame without it.The collector in me would also have preferred if the original cut of the film was included on a separate disc, but at the same time, as it's just a HD rip of the original film that I've seen a bazillion times anyway, it's not a deal breaker.I'm happy with this version.",5,"Happy GITS fan, here",1259020800,"11 24, 2009",2009,1744,"[""'m"", 'happy', 'new', 'generation', 'viewers', 'may', 'get', 'chance', 'see', 'groundbreaking', 'Sci-Fi/Art', 'movie', 'fresh', 'eyes', 'ears', 'remember', 'putting', 'film', 'audio', 'cassette', 'tape', 'years', 'could', 'listen', 'work', 'car..', 'was', 'one', 'first', 'anime', 'remember', 'had', 'brilliant', 'ambient', 'score', 'drenched', 'film', 'really', 'eerie', 'stoic', 'mood', 'remastered', 'Skywalker', 'sound', 'soundtrack', 'effects', 'track', 'are', 'total', 'joy', 'music', 'dynamic', 'range', 'captured', 'better', 'ever', 'plethora', 'miscellaneous', 'background', 'effects', 'flesh', 'out', 'action', 'better', 'ever.In', 'nearly', 'scene', 'colors', 'look', 'deeper', 'more', 'genuine', 'original', 'print..', 'alot', 'more', 'simulated', 'depth', 'field', 'not', 'only', 'newly', 'inserted', 'visuals', 'just', 'clever', 'color', 'contrast', 'tweaks.And', 'NO', 'have', 'qualms', 'added', 'CGI', 'elements', 'Mamoru', 'Oshii', 'approved', 'Oshii', 'ever', 'reiterated', 'themes', 'series', 'always', 'been', 'disassociation', 'dehumanization', 'philosophy', 'making', 'dolls', 'human', 'form', 'so', 'viewer', 'having', 'few', 'scenes', 'where', 'Major', 'Kusanagi', 're-visualized', 'even', 'more', 'stylized', 'antiseptic', 'digital', 'shape', ""n't"", 'bother', 'whole', 'point', 'character.The', 'cropping', 'shots', 'bothered', 'little', 'get', 'feeling', 'was', ""n't"", 'done', 'looked', 'good', 'was', ""n't"", 'way', 'fix', 'alter', 'color', 'timing', 'frame', 'it.The', 'collector', 'would', 'also', 'have', 'preferred', 'original', 'cut', 'film', 'was', 'included', 'separate', 'disc', 'same', 'time', 'just', 'HD', 'rip', 'original', 'film', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'bazillion', 'anyway', 'not', 'deal', 'breaker.I', ""'m"", 'happy', 'version']",N/A

I was wary about the changes they made, as written on the back on the blu-ray case. The verdict: Excellent picture, but the 3D animation enhancements they put in sink it. And it's not so much that I'm against CG enhancements; it's that the CG is cheap and cartoony! What I would expect in the opening crawl of your standard PS3 game, not a motion picture. The opening titles with the fast moving numbers (one of many things that influenced The Matrix) have been replaced by the background menu of a PS3 player, from the looks of it. It's one of many graphics changes. And yet, I could almost forgive all the background changes - except they chose to re-animate in CG our main character (Major Motoko Kusanagi) in two major sequences that are distracting beyond belief! The original filmmakers names are still on this; I don't know how they could think this would look any good, cutting from fake-looking 3D animation back to cell animation in the same scene. The 3D elements in the sequel, Innocence, look better by comparison; likely because it was planned that way.One blu-ray bonus is that the original version of GITS is in the special features. But I swear they made it look grainy and dirty on purpose (like it was captured off laserdisc or something), just to make 2.0 look like the better, true version.
