This would be a good movie for adults and children to share.King William banished the evil sorcerer Rothbart from his kingdom for plotting against him. Rothbart of course vows revenge.William's daughter Odette is a couple of years younger than the neighboring kingdom's Prince Derek, so their parents naturally plot to throw them together, spending every summer with Odette and William visiting with Derek and his mother, Queen Uberta. Since Odette's mother never appears, one wonders why William doesn't simply marry Uberta and save the children the grief. Because they hate each other as children. We all know how that ends: they grow up and suddenly see some advantages in having this arranged match.But Derek makes a terribly stupid mistake and insults Odette, so she decides she doesn't want to marry him after all. Before he can properly apologize and set things right, Rothbart kidnaps Odette and puts her under a spell. He turns her into a swan, but if she's on the lake near his castle when the moon shines on her, she will turn back into a human princess until the moon goes down.The rest of the story is a pretty conventional brave prince rescues beautiful princess, except for the humor of it all. Odette has two close friends, a turtle named Speed and a frog with a French accent (of course) named Jean-Bob. Together with a puffin who shows up to help plan Odette's rescue, they do the best comedy routines and help save the princess.Of course it's more complicated than that, but the plot elements will all seem pretty familiar to those of us who grew up on Disney. This is not Disney, and in fact in some ways is more clever than most Disney romantic fantasies. The animation is the old-fashioned kind, and really rather pretty.

It is trite....not fresh or original but boring. It resembles real life too much.  I thought the film would portray the emotional high of meeting someone and falling in love and end with a happily ever after. Instead, it shows a couple already married and a bride already frustrated with the grooms lack of attention or neglect of her. Odette is beautiful and the prince has lost that loving feeling and would rather chase after bad guys or save the kingdom 24 hours a day than make love to Odette. This is too much like real life and not what I want to see when I view a Disney romantic movie. I prefer the high of the first few years of meeting each other and not the moments when the couple began to grow comfortable with each other and take each other for granted and need a transfusion to make the love grow strong again. Lastly, the inclusion of Odette's mother in law.  Are they kidding?  Who wants to see a mother in law in a disney romantic movie, let alone in your own home during the first 5 years of marriage. It resembles real life too much with the mother in law. Derek's mom is nothing short of annoying and would definitely kill all romance and be annoying as all get out. It is clearly obvious she has no boundaries what so ever and would speak her mind when it would be inappropriate regards their children, their life and anything at all. I speak from experience with this. I endured a mother in law who did all these things. It was awful and forgettable all the way down to the awful boundaries or nonexistent boundaries. Case and point: taking my few days old newborn early in the wee hours, without asking, out of the crib before the princess awakens (not a problem for some I am sure. this may be a sign of an already strained relationship due to her poor boundaries or unsolicited advice), taking the front seat and putting the princess (me) in the backseat while she sat up front with my spouse, constant put downs, etc etc  I will not go on. I may run out of room on amazon. In conclusion, leave the mother in law out. She has forgotten what romance is all about and will spoil everything with dysfunctional behavior. Allow them to meet and fall in love and live happily ever after in my dreams. Do not begin a movie with them married and already not happily ever after. Good day!  I am going to watch The Princess and the Frog!  A real romance movie by Disney. p.s. It is clear that this movie has only brought back some bad memories for me and awakened some of my frustrations with married life. I can only give it 1 star.

First of all, both of the protagonists are hilarious in their boy v. girl mentality. Forced into marriage by their parents for politics, Derek and Odette despise each other as children and constantly bicker whenever forced to spend time together. Over time the two grow to love each other and that is when fate intervenes. Odette, afraid that Derek only likes her because she's become beautiful, leaves in a huff and is trapped by an evil sorcerer's spell. Hilarious antics involving animal companions and heart-wrenching scenes of Derek nearly murdering Odette's swan self ensue before the breathtaking ending.Odette is a wonderful girl that little girls will emulate and look up to and Derek is a handsome fellow that little girls will hope to find themselves one day.

377562,A4FX5YCJA630V,6303486894,"R. M. Fisher ""Ravenya""","[40, 44]","This classic fairytale story is based on possibly the most famous ballet of all time - Swan Lake. It is loosely based however, and follows the traditional Disney pattern of storytelling with romance, adventure, slapstick, musical numbers animal sidekicks, and of course with love conquering all.Princess Odette (Michelle Nicastro)and Prince Derek (Howard McGillin) are betrothed from an early age by their parents in the hopes that their two kingdoms will be united. The only problem is - the two can't stand each other. However, unlike most other romance movies where the hero and heroine go through many trials before realising they're in love, Odette and Derek fall for each other within the opening five minutes of the film as they grow from child to adult during the opening song. However, due to Derek's claims that Odette's beauty is the only thing that matters to him, Odette rejects his marriage proposal and she and her father return home to their kingdom. They do not get far however - the evil Count Rothbart (Jack Palance) is waiting for them, and transforms into a terrifying beast and kidnaps Odette, changing her into a swan. At the reclusive lake that Odette is taken to, Odette learns that she is a swan every day, except for an hour each night when she changes back into human form. The only way to break this curse is for her one true love to make a vow of everlasting love and prove it to the world. Rothbart's reasons for kidnapping Odette are to force her into marriage so that he might take over the kingdom. Odette refuses, convinced that Derek will save her, and with her animal friends Speed the turtle, Jean-Bob (John Cleese) the frog and Puffin the (what else?) puffin they lure Derek to the lake to witness her metamorphosis for himself. Reunited, the lovers make a plan - tomorrow night at his mother's ball Derek will give Odette his vow of everlasting love. However, Rothbart is one step ahead of him and imprisons Odette, sending his disguised servant to the palace in her place...The protagonists Odette and Derek are a satisfactory hero and heroine for the story. Odette is the typical fairytale princess (blonde hair, blue eyes, etc) but has some very twenty-first century ideals - she refuses to marry Derek if all he sees is his beauty (though strangely enough she is singing a few minutes later about how much she loves him) and takes it into her on hands (or wings) to bring Derek to the lake. Derek, however is an imbecile. Among other things he insults his bride-to-be, nearly kills her, and then confesses his love to another woman. His redeeming features are his singing voice and his heroic athletic abilities with a bow and arrow.The secondary characters are far more enjoyable - Odette's animal friends will appeal mostly to kids - the heroic Scottish Puffin, the slow but steady Speed, and (cleverly following the fairytale of the Frog Prince) the snobbish and proud Jean-Bob who believes all he has to do to be transformed into a prince is to be kissed by a fair maiden. Adults should warm to Derek's flustering and hysterical mother Queen Uberta, who comes across as the typical interferring and meddling mother, and Derek's consort, the wry and sarcastic Rogers. Also worth noting is Derek's best friend, the cowardly Brom who inevitably swallows his fears to save the day.The Swan Princess is on the whole an enjoyable, traditional fairytale with all the components one would expect. Great songs, good animation, successfully funny jokes and an interesting story with only a plot holes all contribute to this. A few scenes got on my nerves, such as Rothbart's techni-colour, disco-like musical number and the down-right tacky beauty-pagent style of the ball, but the last twenty minutes of the movie - including Odette's escape from the prison, the imposter-Odette drawing Derek's attention from the desparate swan at the windows, and Derek's final fight with Rothbart more than make up for it. This movie is a must for all fairytale lovers.",4,A Classic Fairytale,1027036800,"07 19, 2002",2002,3994,"['classic', 'fairytale', 'story', 'based', 'possibly', 'most', 'famous', 'ballet', 'time', 'Swan', 'Lake', 'loosely', 'based', 'however', 'traditional', 'Disney', 'pattern', 'storytelling', 'romance', 'adventure', 'slapstick', 'musical', 'numbers', 'animal', 'sidekicks', 'course', 'love', 'conquering', 'all.Princess', 'Odette', 'Michelle', 'Nicastro', 'Prince', 'Derek', 'Howard', 'McGillin', 'are', 'betrothed', 'early', 'age', 'parents', 'hopes', 'two', 'kingdoms', 'will', 'be', 'united', 'only', 'problem', 'two', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'other', 'However', 'most', 'other', 'romance', 'movies', 'where', 'hero', 'heroine', 'go', 'many', 'trials', 'realising', ""'re"", 'love', 'Odette', 'Derek', 'fall', 'other', 'opening', 'five', 'minutes', 'film', 'grow', 'child', 'adult', 'opening', 'song', 'However', 'due', 'Derek', 'claims', 'Odette', 'beauty', 'only', 'thing', 'matters', 'Odette', 'marriage', 'proposal', 'father', 'return', 'home', 'kingdom', 'do', 'not', 'get', 'far', 'however', 'evil', 'Count', 'Rothbart', 'Jack', 'Palance', 'waiting', 'transforms', 'terrifying', 'beast', 'kidnaps', 'Odette', 'changing', 'swan', 'reclusive', 'lake', 'Odette', 'taken', 'Odette', 'swan', 'day', 'hour', 'night', 'when', 'back', 'human', 'form', 'only', 'way', 'break', 'curse', 'one', 'true', 'love', 'make', 'vow', 'everlasting', 'love', 'prove', 'world', 'Rothbart', 'reasons', 'kidnapping', 'Odette', 'are', 'force', 'marriage', 'so', 'might', 'take', 'over', 'kingdom', 'Odette', 'convinced', 'Derek', 'will', 'save', 'animal', 'friends', 'Speed', 'turtle', 'Jean-Bob', 'John', 'Cleese', 'frog', 'Puffin', 'what', 'else', 'puffin', 'lure', 'Derek', 'lake', 'witness', 'metamorphosis', 'Reunited', 'lovers', 'make', 'plan', 'tomorrow', 'night', 'mother', 'ball', 'Derek', 'will', 'give', 'Odette', 'vow', 'everlasting', 'love', 'However', 'Rothbart', 'one', 'step', 'ahead', 'imprisons', 'Odette', 'sending', 'disguised', 'servant', 'palace', 'place', 'protagonists', 'Odette', 'Derek', 'are', 'satisfactory', 'hero', 'heroine', 'story', 'Odette', 'typical', 'fairytale', 'princess', 'blonde', 'hair', 'blue', 'eyes', 'etc', 'very', 'twenty-first', 'century', 'ideals', 'marry', 'Derek', 'beauty', 'strangely', 'enough', 'singing', 'few', 'minutes', 'later', 'how', 'much', 'hands', 'wings', 'bring', 'Derek', 'lake', 'Derek', 'however', 'imbecile', 'other', 'things', 'insults', 'bride-to-be', 'nearly', 'then', 'love', 'woman', 'redeeming', 'features', 'are', 'singing', 'voice', 'heroic', 'athletic', 'abilities', 'bow', 'arrow.The', 'secondary', 'characters', 'are', 'far', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'Odette', 'animal', 'friends', 'will', 'appeal', 'mostly', 'kids', 'heroic', 'Scottish', 'Puffin', 'slow', 'steady', 'Speed', 'cleverly', 'following', 'fairytale', 'Frog', 'Prince', 'snobbish', 'proud', 'Jean-Bob', 'who', 'do', 'be', 'transformed', 'prince', 'be', 'kissed', 'fair', 'maiden', 'Adults', 'should', 'warm', 'Derek', 'flustering', 'hysterical', 'mother', 'Queen', 'Uberta', 'who', 'typical', 'interferring', 'meddling', 'mother', 'Derek', 'consort', 'wry', 'sarcastic', 'Rogers', 'Also', 'worth', 'noting', 'Derek', 'best', 'friend', 'cowardly', 'Brom', 'who', 'inevitably', 'fears', 'save', 'day.The', 'Swan', 'Princess', 'whole', 'enjoyable', 'traditional', 'fairytale', 'components', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'Great', 'songs', 'good', 'animation', 'successfully', 'funny', 'jokes', 'interesting', 'story', 'only', 'plot', 'contribute', 'few', 'scenes', 'got', 'nerves', 'such', 'Rothbart', 'techni-colour', 'disco-like', 'musical', 'number', 'down-right', 'tacky', 'beauty-pagent', 'style', 'ball', 'last', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'movie', 'including', 'Odette', 'escape', 'prison', 'imposter-Odette', 'drawing', 'Derek', 'attention', 'desparate', 'swan', 'windows', 'Derek', 'final', 'fight', 'Rothbart', 'more', 'make', 'up', 'movie', 'must', 'fairytale', 'lovers']",The Swan Princess VHS

377566,A37DZX4F5RU2PQ,6303486894,Sarita Dutta,"[6, 7]","Dazzling, colorful animation accompanied by sweetly dulcet music bring this fairy tale to life, which will definitely leave a lasting impression on your mind. Directed by Richard Rich, The Swan Princess tells us the story of a beautiful princess named Odette. Her birth brings great joy to her father King William, who on this occasion betroths her to the heir of the neighboring kingdom, Prince Derek; son of the widowed queen Uberta. The two children are brought together each summer with hopes that they would one day fall in love. This eventually does happen; (though as kids they were always fighting) but when asked by Odette what he sees other than her beauty, Derek fails to proclaim his love for her. Meanwhile the evil enchanter Rothbart, who had been banished from the kingdom, ambushes the king and princess, kills William and kidnaps Odette. She is turned into a swan and changes back to her true form only when the moonlight touches her wings. The spell can alone be broken by a vow of everlasting love from Derek. With the help of her hilarious friends Jean-Bob, the frog and Speed, the turtle; she must prove her true love and defeat Rothbart.The animation, which consists mostly of hand painted cels, is simply majestic; the backgrounds and characters looking nothing short of spectacular. The movie took three long years in the making and the intense labor of the artists is indeed observed in the stunning visual style of the film.The music, by Lex De Azevedo (with lyrics by David Zippel) is brilliantly composed; songs like `This Is My Idea' and' Practice, Practice, Practice' being well-placed and catchy. `Far Longer Than Forever' is matchless in its melody, with its haunting tune and luscious music that touches your heart (it received a Golden Globe nomination for best song in 1994). As to why it did not receive an Oscar nomination is still a big mystery to me, as in every way it is comparable to `A Whole New World' or `Beauty And The Beast'. The end-title solo `Eternity' is beautifully performed by Miwa Yoshida. The score (also by Azevedo) is rich and vibrant, brightly highlighting the emotional sequences in the film.The portrayal of the characters is done marvelously. Odette is beautiful and kind, her romantic heart making sacrifices for her true love. Prince Derek is handsome, brave and passionate, and he proves his love for Odette in the end. The villain Rothbart, though sometimes a bit scary for younger viewers, provides a strong negative character. The sidekicks, Jean-Bob, Speed and Puffin are hilarious and they bring most of the humorous moments. Derek's mother Uberta, his mentor, Lord Rogers and his cowardly companion, Bromley are wonderfully depicted, their presence adding comic warmth to the movie.The voice cast comprises of talented artists. Jack Palance is superb as the dark voice of Rothbart. John Cleese voices Jean-Bob with a peculiar French accent which is simply loveable. Sandy Duncan brings Uberta to life with spasm and liveliness and Steven Wright well portrays the character of Speed. Howard Mcgillin is excellent as the speaking and singing voice of Prince Derek and Michelle Nicastro is the perfect choice for Odette, her voice both warm and gentle.Overall, a well done movie, which although does not earn the title of a classic or masterpiece; is yet unique in beauty and offers something for the entire family. It brilliantly conveys the message of love and sacrifice (although I believe that the script could have been developed a little more). Sadly, the DVD of this movie has never been released in the US. I had to import mine from Europe (where it has been officially released by Columbia Tristar video). So if you enjoy spectacular animation and melodious music, this movie will be wonderfully entertaining. As for me, I simply adore it and shall always keep a special place for it in my heart.",5,IT CHARMS YOU WITH ITS SPLENDID VISUALS AND MELODIOUS MUSIC!,1060041600,"08 5, 2003",2003,3873,"['Dazzling', 'colorful', 'animation', 'accompanied', 'sweetly', 'dulcet', 'music', 'bring', 'fairy', 'tale', 'life', 'will', 'definitely', 'leave', 'lasting', 'impression', 'mind', 'Directed', 'Richard', 'Rich', 'Swan', 'Princess', 'story', 'beautiful', 'princess', 'named', 'Odette', 'birth', 'brings', 'great', 'joy', 'father', 'King', 'William', 'who', 'occasion', 'heir', 'neighboring', 'kingdom', 'Prince', 'Derek', 'son', 'widowed', 'queen', 'Uberta', 'two', 'children', 'are', 'brought', 'together', 'summer', 'hopes', 'would', 'one', 'day', 'fall', 'love', 'eventually', 'happen', 'as', 'kids', 'were', 'always', 'fighting', 'when', 'asked', 'Odette', 'what', 'other', 'beauty', 'Derek', 'proclaim', 'love', 'Meanwhile', 'evil', 'enchanter', 'Rothbart', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'banished', 'kingdom', 'king', 'princess', 'William', 'kidnaps', 'Odette', 'turned', 'swan', 'changes', 'back', 'true', 'form', 'only', 'when', 'moonlight', 'wings', 'spell', 'can', 'alone', 'be', 'broken', 'vow', 'everlasting', 'love', 'Derek', 'help', 'hilarious', 'friends', 'Jean-Bob', 'frog', 'Speed', 'turtle', 'must', 'prove', 'true', 'love', 'defeat', 'Rothbart.The', 'animation', 'mostly', 'hand', 'painted', 'cels', 'simply', 'majestic', 'backgrounds', 'characters', 'looking', 'nothing', 'short', 'spectacular', 'movie', 'took', 'three', 'long', 'years', 'making', 'intense', 'labor', 'artists', 'indeed', 'observed', 'stunning', 'visual', 'style', 'film.The', 'music', 'Lex', 'De', 'Azevedo', 'lyrics', 'David', 'Zippel', 'brilliantly', 'composed', 'songs', 'Idea', 'Practice', 'Practice', 'Practice', 'being', 'well-placed', 'catchy', 'Far', 'Longer', 'Than', 'Forever', 'matchless', 'melody', 'haunting', 'tune', 'luscious', 'music', 'heart', 'received', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'nomination', 'best', 'song', '1994', 'why', 'did', 'not', 'receive', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'still', 'big', 'mystery', 'way', 'comparable', 'A', 'Whole', 'New', 'World', 'Beauty', 'Beast', 'end-title', 'solo', 'Eternity', 'beautifully', 'performed', 'Miwa', 'Yoshida', 'score', 'also', 'Azevedo', 'rich', 'vibrant', 'brightly', 'highlighting', 'emotional', 'sequences', 'film.The', 'portrayal', 'characters', 'done', 'marvelously', 'Odette', 'beautiful', 'kind', 'romantic', 'heart', 'making', 'sacrifices', 'true', 'love', 'Prince', 'Derek', 'handsome', 'brave', 'passionate', 'love', 'Odette', 'end', 'villain', 'Rothbart', 'sometimes', 'bit', 'scary', 'younger', 'viewers', 'strong', 'negative', 'character', 'sidekicks', 'Jean-Bob', 'Speed', 'Puffin', 'are', 'hilarious', 'bring', 'most', 'humorous', 'moments', 'Derek', 'mother', 'Uberta', 'mentor', 'Lord', 'Rogers', 'cowardly', 'companion', 'Bromley', 'are', 'wonderfully', 'depicted', 'presence', 'adding', 'comic', 'warmth', 'movie.The', 'voice', 'cast', 'comprises', 'talented', 'artists', 'Jack', 'Palance', 'superb', 'dark', 'voice', 'Rothbart', 'John', 'Cleese', 'voices', 'Jean-Bob', 'peculiar', 'French', 'accent', 'simply', 'loveable', 'Sandy', 'Duncan', 'brings', 'Uberta', 'life', 'spasm', 'liveliness', 'Steven', 'Wright', 'well', 'character', 'Speed', 'Howard', 'Mcgillin', 'excellent', 'speaking', 'singing', 'voice', 'Prince', 'Derek', 'Michelle', 'Nicastro', 'perfect', 'choice', 'Odette', 'voice', 'warm', 'gentle.Overall', 'well', 'done', 'movie', 'not', 'earn', 'title', 'classic', 'masterpiece', 'yet', 'unique', 'beauty', 'something', 'entire', 'family', 'brilliantly', 'message', 'love', 'sacrifice', 'believe', 'script', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'developed', 'little', 'more', 'Sadly', 'DVD', 'movie', 'never', 'been', 'released', 'US', 'had', 'import', 'mine', 'Europe', 'where', 'been', 'officially', 'released', 'Columbia', 'Tristar', 'video', 'So', 'enjoy', 'spectacular', 'animation', 'melodious', 'music', 'movie', 'will', 'be', 'wonderfully', 'entertaining', 'simply', 'adore', 'shall', 'always', 'keep', 'special', 'place', 'heart']",The Swan Princess VHS

I was thoroughly entertained the whole way! The animation is a lesser quality than what I am used to seeing from Disney animation, but it is solid and the animals and people moved fairly naturally. The colors were bright during happy times and dark during the sad times so it is very easy to see what part of the story you are in and who the good guys and the bad guys are. The songs were charming and really fit the story, though most of them were really short -- no more than a few lines -- and then they go back to talking. It is not like you would ever hear them on the radio, but they really added to my enjoyment level of this movie.The secondary characters were absolutely my favorite part of this film. The prince's widowed mother (voiced by Sandy Duncan) is determined to see her son marry and she goes to every matchmaking length imaginable (including a Princesses on Parade beauty pageant at a ball); the prince's best friend, Bromley, (voiced by Joel McKinnon Miller) is clumsy and cowardly, but insists that he is just as good as the prince and keeps trying to prove it; the court musicians were a riot dressed as animals for the Prince to practice ""hunting""; the Princess's frog companion, Jean-Bob (voiced by John Cleese) truly believes that he will turn into a prince if he can just get a kiss from Odette; the slow-moving turtle (voiced by Steven Wright) keeps trying to talk sense into the frog and surprises everyone when he lives up to his nickname of ""Speed""; and that is just the start of the list!The first hour is by far my favorite part of this film. The first song happens almost immediately and carries us through the prince & princess growing up and spending summers together with their matchmaking parents throwing them together as often as possible. The villain is pretty scary and can turn into a giant beast who attacks and kills people, but it adds excitement to the film rather than keeps children too scared to see it. There are so many funny situations and so many opportunities to laugh for children and adults alike in the beginning of the film that you simply have to see it for yourself!
