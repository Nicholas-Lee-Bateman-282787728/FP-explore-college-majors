Sally Hemmings was a 14 year old girl having sex with a 49 year old man, and she was his slave at the time.  The idea that she really had consent is laughable.  Did she maybe admire Jefferson because of his power....perhaps?  Who knows how she really thought of herself in this context as his slave.  But to make it seem like they must have had a wonderful love story because she was with him until his death is suspect.  This is a hollywood fantasy!  Sally had little choice to leave and may not have run away for the sake of her children (even though her light skin and european features may have made it easier for her to pass as white).  In the system of slavery - blackmailing your slave to stay is not an strange concept.  She was a woman trapped in her time and probably figured she had to make the best of her circumstance in order to survive.  Interestingly, there is an attitude in American culture that is loathe to truly discuss the events of slavery. Instead we seem satisfied with an ""overview"" of what happened....picking cotton in the hot sun, children sold away from their mothers.... But their is another glaring aspect of slavery that is quietly tucked away and usually not mentioned.  African women descended mostly from West Africa where people are very dark skinned; were raped on slave ships, plantations, etc.  The fact that so many Black Americans have light brown to nearly white skin is evidence that this violation occurred often and for a long period in American history.  Sally Hemming's mother was half white and her own father was a white slaveowner.  In the Americas - the African dasphora is very mixed genetically.  In fact, it doesn't take much thinking to realize that over time some of the enslaved were gasp....genetically more white than black! But as time passes it is evident that many modern day Americans are simply clueless about the prevalance of racial mixing during that time perioed and haven't made the connection as to why Black Americans come in so many shades. They are ignorant of this other side of slavery because it is not taught in any detail in American schools.  At least this movie gives a window into the fact that rape occurred, as in the case of Sally's sister Critta.  Plus the ""seduction"" of Sally is shown to happen in her teen years (statuatory rape) by modern standards.  However, I still don't buy the idea that Sally was really in love with Jefferson.",3,for entertainment purposes only...,1301702400,"04 2, 2011",2011,2506,"[""'ve"", 'seen', 'movie', 'tv', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'was', 'offended', 'title', 'Sally', 'Hemmings', 'was', '14', 'year', 'old', 'girl', 'having', 'sex', '49', 'year', 'old', 'man', 'was', 'slave', 'time', 'idea', 'really', 'had', 'consent', 'laughable', 'Did', 'maybe', 'admire', 'Jefferson', 'power', '.perhaps', 'Who', 'how', 'really', 'thought', 'herself', 'context', 'slave', 'make', 'seem', 'must', 'have', 'had', 'wonderful', 'love', 'story', 'was', 'death', 'suspect', 'hollywood', 'fantasy', 'Sally', 'had', 'little', 'choice', 'leave', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'run', 'away', 'sake', 'children', 'even', 'light', 'skin', 'european', 'features', 'may', 'have', 'made', 'easier', 'pass', 'white', 'system', 'slavery', 'blackmailing', 'slave', 'stay', 'not', 'strange', 'concept', 'was', 'woman', 'trapped', 'time', 'probably', 'figured', 'had', 'make', 'best', 'circumstance', 'order', 'survive', 'Interestingly', 'attitude', 'American', 'culture', 'loathe', 'truly', 'discuss', 'events', 'slavery', 'Instead', 'seem', 'satisfied', 'overview', 'what', 'happened', '.picking', 'cotton', 'hot', 'sun', 'children', 'sold', 'away', 'mothers', 'glaring', 'aspect', 'slavery', 'quietly', 'tucked', 'away', 'usually', 'not', 'mentioned', 'African', 'women', 'descended', 'mostly', 'West', 'Africa', 'where', 'people', 'are', 'very', 'dark', 'skinned', 'were', 'raped', 'slave', 'ships', 'plantations', 'etc', 'fact', 'so', 'many', 'Black', 'Americans', 'have', 'light', 'brown', 'nearly', 'white', 'skin', 'evidence', 'violation', 'occurred', 'often', 'long', 'period', 'American', 'history', 'Sally', 'Hemming', 'mother', 'was', 'half', 'white', 'own', 'father', 'was', 'white', 'slaveowner', 'Americas', 'African', 'dasphora', 'very', 'mixed', 'genetically', 'fact', ""n't"", 'take', 'much', 'thinking', 'realize', 'time', 'enslaved', 'were', 'gasp', '.genetically', 'more', 'white', 'black', 'time', 'evident', 'many', 'modern', 'day', 'Americans', 'are', 'simply', 'clueless', 'prevalance', 'racial', 'mixing', 'time', 'perioed', 'have', ""n't"", 'made', 'connection', 'why', 'Black', 'Americans', 'come', 'so', 'many', 'shades', 'are', 'ignorant', 'other', 'side', 'slavery', 'not', 'taught', 'detail', 'American', 'schools', 'least', 'movie', 'window', 'fact', 'rape', 'occurred', 'case', 'Sally', 'sister', 'Critta', 'seduction', 'Sally', 'shown', 'happen', 'teen', 'years', 'statuatory', 'rape', 'modern', 'standards', 'However', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'buy', 'idea', 'Sally', 'was', 'really', 'love', 'Jefferson']",Sally Hemings:An American Scandal VHS

While the DNA tests (combined with a preponderance of historical evidence) makes it almost certain that Thomas Jefferson was the father of Eston Hemings, the tests are as important for what they disprove.Among other things, one claim conclusively disproven was Jefferson's paternity of Thomas Woodson, which renders the entire Parisian chapter of this movie a complete fiction.  It goes downhill from that point, with the narrative implying an extended correspondence between Jefferson & Hemings (there is no evidence that Sally Hemings was even literate), that Hemings was involved in some naiscent Underground Railroad (again, who knows?) and that Sally Hemings pops up unannounced at the White House one night (was it really that easy for a slave to travel from Charlottesville to Washington DC undetected?) to kiss & make up with ""Thomas.""In between all of these historical improbabilities, we are subjected to pontificating of the first order.

Sadly this was changed from the originalSally Hemings - An American Scandal(see my review, which is the only one under THAT title).The whole reference of the original title was to the scandal of slavery, and the scandal of Thomas Jefferson doing nothing about it. Then some idiot decides to go and change the title. My copy of the film is the original DVD release, original title.Really I wish this had simply been titled SALLY AND THOMAS.Here, my favorite immortal Sam Neill plays Jefferson as a rather sophisticated and randy old fellow. A bit wide as interpretations go, but then again, who can say. This covers the period in Jefferson's life from approximately his political beginnings in the nation's capitol until his death.The acting is rather awful, except for Neill, and to my mind the portrayal of Sally Hemings is downright offensive. However, I leave that for you to decide. It's just my opinion, and I cannot take the road Benjamin Franklin could afford to take when he said his opinion was that he had no opinion, but that he just might eventually learn what his opinion might be. Mario Van Peebles as James Hemings was a heartbreaking derailing of the story, and my opinion is I found him offensive also.Sorry, I just don't think this thing was handled well. Witness the shame that moved its re-release under a new title. One other thing: the direct descendants of Thomas and Sally are still being treated like DOGS. That in itself, while not overtly related to this film, says it all.In any case, this is a television film and sadly it reflects that all too amply.

192091,A1UHEXKLJNRRD3,1574928228,"Emily K. Stuart ""PhantomFan""","[10, 12]","I have to give the filmmakers credit for bringing to light a story that, for so long, historians rejected. We now know that Thomas Jefferson did indeed have a 30-year relationship with Sally Hemings, his slave (and wife's half-sister). The dialogue is bad, costuming not particularly accurate, and the actors pretty bad. All that can be overlooked.  What is problematic to me is that the story, as presented here, is largely fictional.First, the actress playing Hemings was entirely too, well, black, to be accurate. Sally Hemings was only 1/4 black and described as being ""mighty near white"" by Edmund Bacon, Jefferson's overseer. Change her clothes from servant/slave gear and one would likely have assumed she was white. We have no knowledge that Sally Hemings could write, let alone read and the movie has her reading and writing in English and French. Given that Jefferson encouraged education and learning music, we have no reason to assume she could do either. And while we know that she had the opportunity to stay behind in France and be free, there is no indication of the drama between herself, her brother, and Jefferson, nor did they flee paris due to an angry mob attacking his home. There is a disturbing scene in which Jefferson all but rapes Hemings in Paris, something we have zero documentation of (and frankly, would be WAY out of line for Jefferson's character.) Also, as the writers are trying to convince the audience that this is a love/companionate relationship, this is a godawful way to do it. We have no facts that prove that Sally was pregnant when she returned home from France (that story was largely concocted by Thomas Woodson, who claimed to be the long-lost first son of Jefferson and Hemings and has since been proven not to be ) Madison Hemings, in his memoirs, refers to a child that was born about 1790 but did not live. Paris is simply the place historians assume the relationship started because Madison Hemings said so in his memoirs. The entire story about Hemings and the slave Henry she was in love with and supposed to marry was a fabrication, as was the rape/whipping scene in the barn. These are two of my least favorite scenes in the movie because they were written purely to tug at teh viewers heartstrings and not to give them any sort of basis in reality. Finally, Andrews assumes a love relationship between Jefferson and Hemings. None of this is documented anywhere at all. After doing very extensive research on the subject, I personally believe that it was a companionate relationship, but one largely based on Jefferson's odd quirks and beliefs (see Death and Desire at Monticello by Andrew Burnstein).I am all in favor of historical fiction - but real historical fiction takes the facts and makes a marginally fictionalized account, not just for entertainment value, but to gain the public's interest in the truth. This film has created a piece of fiction using real characters. That's just not the same as historical fiction. It appears that Thomas Jefferson: An Intimate History (by Fawn Brodie) and Barbara Chase-Riboud's Sally Hemings: A Novel were both read by the writers and they skipped over the academic stuff entirely - a huge mistake.I have watched this movie several times, in different years, and at different points in my eduation (I'm doing a Master's in American History) and my opinion of the film sinks lower every time I watch it. I support the movie's purpose, but not actual product. So, if you're looking for something entertaining AND accurate, try reading any of Annette Gordon-Wood's books, Death and Desire at Monticello, Jefferson's Notes on the State of Virginia (the sections that relate to slavery), and Joseph Ellis' Thomas Jefferson: The American Sphynx.",2,Very poorly executed,1222992000,"10 3, 2008",2008,3744,"['have', 'give', 'filmmakers', 'credit', 'bringing', 'light', 'story', 'so', 'long', 'historians', 'rejected', 'now', 'know', 'Thomas', 'Jefferson', 'did', 'indeed', 'have', '30-year', 'relationship', 'Sally', 'Hemings', 'slave', 'wife', 'half-sister', 'dialogue', 'bad', 'costuming', 'not', 'particularly', 'accurate', 'actors', 'pretty', 'bad', 'can', 'be', 'overlooked', 'What', 'problematic', 'story', 'presented', 'here', 'largely', 'fictional.First', 'actress', 'playing', 'Hemings', 'was', 'entirely', 'too', 'well', 'black', 'be', 'accurate', 'Sally', 'Hemings', 'was', 'only', '1/4', 'black', 'described', 'being', 'mighty', 'white', 'Edmund', 'Bacon', 'Jefferson', 'overseer', 'Change', 'clothes', 'servant/slave', 'gear', 'one', 'would', 'likely', 'have', 'assumed', 'was', 'white', 'have', 'knowledge', 'Sally', 'Hemings', 'could', 'write', 'let', 'alone', 'read', 'movie', 'reading', 'writing', 'English', 'French', 'Given', 'Jefferson', 'encouraged', 'education', 'learning', 'music', 'have', 'reason', 'assume', 'could', 'do', 'know', 'had', 'opportunity', 'stay', 'France', 'be', 'free', 'indication', 'drama', 'brother', 'Jefferson', 'did', 'flee', 'paris', 'due', 'angry', 'mob', 'attacking', 'home', 'disturbing', 'scene', 'Jefferson', 'rapes', 'Hemings', 'Paris', 'something', 'have', 'zero', 'documentation', 'frankly', 'would', 'be', 'WAY', 'line', 'Jefferson', 'character', 'Also', 'writers', 'are', 'trying', 'convince', 'audience', 'love/companionate', 'relationship', 'godawful', 'way', 'do', 'have', 'facts', 'prove', 'Sally', 'was', 'pregnant', 'when', 'returned', 'home', 'France', 'story', 'was', 'largely', 'concocted', 'Thomas', 'Woodson', 'who', 'claimed', 'be', 'long-lost', 'first', 'son', 'Jefferson', 'Hemings', 'been', 'proven', 'not', 'be', 'Madison', 'Hemings', 'memoirs', 'refers', 'child', 'was', 'born', '1790', 'did', 'not', 'live', 'Paris', 'simply', 'place', 'assume', 'relationship', 'started', 'Madison', 'Hemings', 'said', 'so', 'memoirs', 'entire', 'story', 'Hemings', 'slave', 'Henry', 'was', 'love', 'supposed', 'marry', 'was', 'fabrication', 'was', 'rape/whipping', 'scene', 'barn', 'are', 'two', 'least', 'favorite', 'scenes', 'movie', 'were', 'written', 'purely', 'tug', 'teh', 'viewers', 'heartstrings', 'not', 'give', 'sort', 'basis', 'reality', 'Finally', 'Andrews', 'love', 'relationship', 'Jefferson', 'Hemings', 'None', 'documented', 'anywhere', 'doing', 'very', 'extensive', 'research', 'subject', 'personally', 'believe', 'was', 'companionate', 'relationship', 'one', 'largely', 'based', 'Jefferson', 'odd', 'quirks', 'beliefs', 'see', 'Death', 'Desire', 'Monticello', 'Andrew', 'Burnstein', '.I', 'am', 'favor', 'historical', 'fiction', 'real', 'historical', 'fiction', 'facts', 'marginally', 'fictionalized', 'account', 'not', 'just', 'entertainment', 'value', 'gain', 'public', 'interest', 'truth', 'film', 'created', 'piece', 'fiction', 'using', 'real', 'characters', 'just', 'not', 'same', 'historical', 'fiction', 'Thomas', 'Jefferson', 'Intimate', 'History', 'Fawn', 'Brodie', 'Barbara', 'Chase-Riboud', 'Sally', 'Hemings', 'Novel', 'were', 'read', 'writers', 'skipped', 'academic', 'stuff', 'entirely', 'huge', 'mistake.I', 'have', 'watched', 'movie', 'several', 'times', 'different', 'years', 'different', 'points', 'eduation', ""'m"", 'doing', 'Master', 'American', 'History', 'opinion', 'film', 'sinks', 'lower', 'time', 'watch', 'support', 'movie', 'purpose', 'not', 'actual', 'product', 'So', ""'re"", 'looking', 'something', 'entertaining', 'AND', 'accurate', 'try', 'reading', 'Annette', 'Gordon-Wood', 'books', 'Death', 'Desire', 'Monticello', 'Jefferson', 'Notes', 'State', 'Virginia', 'sections', 'relate', 'slavery', 'Joseph', 'Ellis', 'Thomas', 'Jefferson', 'American', 'Sphynx']",Sally Hemings:An American Scandal VHS
192092,A17V5NNFG7QGKS,1574928228,Eve Galewitz,"[75, 82]","of President Jefferson and his concubine/slave Sally Hemings, there remains a rather usual story of a widower who transfers his well-known affection for his young deceased wife to her equally beautiful sister.  Sally Hemings and Martha Jefferson were half-sisters and it was said that they looked rather alike.  Sally came to Monticello with the marriage of Martha to Thomas Jefferson.It is easy to point up the hypocrisy of Thomas Jefferson, the author who wrote so eloquently of freedom in the Declaration of Independence while denying to others, but initially Jefferson did seek the end of slavery in the 13 colonies.  During the days of the Continental Congress he urged the abolition of slavery as part and parcel of the newly created United States, but was persuaded to drop the cause when the southern states threatened to bolt and withdraw their much needed support in the inevitable clash with the the crown.  Following the Revolution Jefferson no longer persued abolitionist ideologyAs a person ages, they often become more conservative and careful in their beliefs.  This was true of Jefferson.  He also held a strong belief in NOT concentrating or centralizing the powers of the government but rather to give the greater authority to each State to govern itself in the newly formed confederation.  Although Jefferson's ideas would give way to Madison and the Federalization of the states; many still cling to the idea of decentralized government; the south in particular used this dictum again and again during the civil rights era in order to maintain their segregationist laws.What can never be known is the true nature of the relationship between Sally Hemings and Jefferson.  Sally Hemings was Jefferson's property and with no personal freedom or rights.  We know that Jefferson instructed Martha Jefferson Randolph, his daughter by Martha Jefferson, to free Sally & her children upon his death.  Many speculate that this was based on his love and affection for this steadfast woman with whom he shared much of his life and by whom he had a number of children.",3,Aside from the dramatic interracial implications...,1187568000,"08 20, 2007",2007,2076,"['President', 'Jefferson', 'concubine/slave', 'Sally', 'Hemings', 'rather', 'usual', 'story', 'widower', 'who', 'well-known', 'affection', 'young', 'deceased', 'wife', 'equally', 'beautiful', 'sister', 'Sally', 'Hemings', 'Martha', 'Jefferson', 'were', 'half-sisters', 'was', 'said', 'looked', 'rather', 'alike', 'Sally', 'came', 'Monticello', 'marriage', 'Martha', 'Thomas', 'Jefferson.It', 'easy', 'point', 'up', 'hypocrisy', 'Thomas', 'Jefferson', 'author', 'who', 'wrote', 'so', 'eloquently', 'freedom', 'Declaration', 'Independence', 'denying', 'others', 'initially', 'Jefferson', 'did', 'seek', 'end', 'slavery', '13', 'colonies', 'days', 'Continental', 'Congress', 'urged', 'abolition', 'slavery', 'part', 'parcel', 'newly', 'created', 'United', 'States', 'was', 'persuaded', 'drop', 'cause', 'when', 'southern', 'states', 'threatened', 'bolt', 'withdraw', 'much', 'needed', 'support', 'inevitable', 'clash', 'crown', 'Following', 'Revolution', 'Jefferson', 'no', 'longer', 'persued', 'abolitionist', 'ideologyAs', 'person', 'ages', 'often', 'become', 'more', 'conservative', 'careful', 'beliefs', 'was', 'true', 'Jefferson', 'also', 'held', 'strong', 'belief', 'NOT', 'concentrating', 'centralizing', 'powers', 'government', 'rather', 'give', 'greater', 'authority', 'State', 'govern', 'newly', 'formed', 'confederation', 'Jefferson', 'ideas', 'would', 'give', 'way', 'Madison', 'Federalization', 'states', 'many', 'still', 'cling', 'idea', 'decentralized', 'government', 'south', 'particular', 'used', 'dictum', 'again', 'again', 'civil', 'rights', 'era', 'order', 'maintain', 'segregationist', 'laws.What', 'can', 'never', 'be', 'known', 'true', 'nature', 'relationship', 'Sally', 'Hemings', 'Jefferson', 'Sally', 'Hemings', 'was', 'Jefferson', 'property', 'personal', 'freedom', 'rights', 'know', 'Jefferson', 'instructed', 'Martha', 'Jefferson', 'Randolph', 'daughter', 'Martha', 'Jefferson', 'free', 'Sally', 'children', 'death', 'Many', 'speculate', 'was', 'based', 'love', 'affection', 'steadfast', 'woman', 'whom', 'shared', 'much', 'life', 'whom', 'had', 'number', 'children']",Sally Hemings:An American Scandal VHS

It is a part of the American past, long hidden, and only proved in 1998. A president, Thomas Jefferson (Sam Neill) lives with his slave, unwed, mistress, openly at times, fathering several children through Sally Hemings (Carmen Ejogo) but never quite takes responsibility for the children. Today it would be as scandalous as it would have been, or should have been then, but...Ejogo does a magnificent job of presenting Sally through all of the emotion and hardship her life held. Good times and bad, Sally was the rock her children needed, and the woman President Jefferson wanted. Of course much of the time they were together, Jefferson was not President, but often politically active. He at least did give the girl, Sally, her freedom early in their relationship, in Paris. Sally first became an active mistress to Jefferson at that location, while just a teenager and maid to Jefferson's daughter, Patsy (Mare Winningham). It was a 38-year relationship that actually continued as Sally cared for Jefferson's grave until her own death. It is a love story. Not a Christian example but sincere love in a bi-racial relationship at a time when it was unacceptable. It leave the viewer the task of deciding ethics.Definitely enough historical record to make this worthy of watching for every student, suggested for ages 12 and over. A DVD value at today's price for the historical content as well as entertainment excellence. The only negative was background musical scores were loud enough it was sometimes difficult to catch all the words of the actors, and subtitles or CC are NOT included.

Carmen Ejogo brings the silent suffering of Sally Hemings to the screen--through her somewhat tumultuous relationship with Jefferson; the loss of children and dignity, and living through the terrible contradiction that is slavery itself.Sam Neill does a fantastic job as Jefferson. Wanting what he wants (as do most Americans) yet not in the position to make any changes and if I may argue, lacking the necessary character to do so. It is interesting though that Mr. Neill accurately portrays the increasingly blurred line between slave and wife for Jefferson who manhandles Hemings in a scene when he thinks she may be involved with another slave. To which she replies: ""you don't have to hurt me you own me"". Of course, both a spouse and a servant wereconsidered a form of property in the time period of the film and you sometimes wonder--debates on the accuracy of this film aside--which he considered her more to be over the course of 38 years.beyond this, the supporting cast is outstanding.  Dihann Carroll is excellent as Sally's strong willed mother.  Klea Scott as Critta, Sally's sister gives a testament to the heart breaking sexual abuse suffered by slave women.

That's as far as science can take us.  We should not create a glorified and highly exaggerated image of Sally Hemings.  Even if Jefferson fathered Hemings' children, one should not make too much of it. When his wife died, Jefferson was still a relatively young man, with powerful needs. It would not be unreasonable for a man to use one of his slaves to relieve himself, any more than it would be unreasonable for him to use a prostitute. And even prostitutes get pregnant. By many contemporaneous accounts, Hemings had sexual intercourse with many men on the bustling Monticello estate. Powerful men have powerful needs and weaknesses. Even so, this does not elevate Hemings to the level of having a serious, significant relationship with Jefferson, any more than Bill Clinton's dalliances are serious relationships.
