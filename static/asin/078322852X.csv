61330,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,078322852X,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","It's easy to forget about `An American Tale: Fievel Goes West' when you consider that it was released the same year as possibly the greatest Disney film of all time, `Beauty and the Beast'.  It was just smothered by the affections given to another and many seem to dismiss this as a lesser film, when it is only lesser by a smidgen.  I mean, in all honesty, 1991 birthed two animated gems...two animated masterpieces, and `An American Tale: Fievel Goes West' was one of them.`Fievel Goes West' tells the story of young mouse Fievel and his family, living in the sewers of New York City.  Fievel and his family along with the other mice in their community are told of lavish cheese paved roads out west and are persuaded to make a move.  Unbeknownst to them, they are being hoarded by a smooth talking feline determined to eat them up.  Fievel discovers this scheme, but a series of events finds him separated from his family with little hope of saving them, until he stumbles onto a legend who just needs a little nudge in the right direction.`An American Tale: Fievel Goes West' is one of the sequels that actually tops the original and lingers longer than one may have expected.  It is heartfelt, earnest and beautifully captured with effective voice acting, colorful animation and a killer original song (Dreams to Dream is beautiful, sincere and affecting).  This is one of those glorious childhood memories that only grows stronger as I advance in adulthood.  Carrying themes of love, family, loyalty and survival, it is a great film for the whole family and is certainly one of the very finest films to be released in the film year that was 1991.  Considering how strong of a film year that was, it is a huge compliment to say that `An American Tale: Fievel Goes West' should have probably landed on Oscar's Best Picture ballot, alongside the masterpiece `Beauty and the Beast'.",5,This tale is a true gem!,1339113600,"06 8, 2012",2012,1884,"['easy', 'forget', 'American', 'Tale', 'Fievel', 'Goes', 'West', 'when', 'consider', 'was', 'released', 'same', 'year', 'possibly', 'greatest', 'Disney', 'film', 'time', 'Beauty', 'Beast', 'was', 'just', 'smothered', 'affections', 'given', 'many', 'seem', 'dismiss', 'lesser', 'film', 'when', 'only', 'lesser', 'smidgen', 'mean', 'honesty', '1991', 'birthed', 'two', 'animated', 'gems', 'two', 'animated', 'masterpieces', 'American', 'Tale', 'Fievel', 'Goes', 'West', 'was', 'one', 'them.', 'Fievel', 'Goes', 'West', 'tells', 'story', 'young', 'mouse', 'Fievel', 'family', 'living', 'sewers', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'Fievel', 'family', 'other', 'mice', 'community', 'are', 'told', 'lavish', 'cheese', 'paved', 'roads', 'out', 'west', 'are', 'persuaded', 'make', 'move', 'Unbeknownst', 'are', 'being', 'hoarded', 'smooth', 'talking', 'feline', 'determined', 'eat', 'up', 'Fievel', 'scheme', 'series', 'events', 'separated', 'family', 'little', 'hope', 'saving', 'legend', 'who', 'just', 'little', 'nudge', 'right', 'direction.', 'American', 'Tale', 'Fievel', 'Goes', 'West', 'one', 'sequels', 'actually', 'original', 'lingers', 'longer', 'one', 'may', 'have', 'expected', 'heartfelt', 'earnest', 'beautifully', 'captured', 'effective', 'voice', 'acting', 'colorful', 'animation', 'killer', 'original', 'song', 'Dreams', 'Dream', 'beautiful', 'sincere', 'affecting', 'one', 'glorious', 'childhood', 'memories', 'only', 'stronger', 'advance', 'adulthood', 'Carrying', 'themes', 'love', 'family', 'loyalty', 'survival', 'great', 'film', 'whole', 'family', 'certainly', 'one', 'very', 'finest', 'films', 'be', 'released', 'film', 'year', 'was', '1991', 'Considering', 'how', 'strong', 'film', 'year', 'was', 'huge', 'compliment', 'say', 'American', 'Tale', 'Fievel', 'Goes', 'West', 'should', 'have', 'probably', 'landed', 'Oscar', 'Best', 'Picture', 'ballot', 'masterpiece', 'Beauty', 'Beast']",N/A
61331,ANGH6401L9Y0T,078322852X,"Barbara Frederick ""auntb93""","[1, 2]","This is not as good as the original American Tail, but it is fun. Two or three elements make the whole thing fun, but there are some parts that drag a bit. An important element is that the characters are cute: they are cleverly drawn, especially the mice, and most especially Fievel and his stage-struck sister. Another element that gets me is the voices. Dom DeLuise is back as the vegetarian cat Tiger, only this time there's no mistaking him for being gay: he's in love with an extremely female female. In fact, she is so seductive she goes west and becomes a dance hall girl. With a heart of gold, of course.The other voice that really got to me was Sheriff Wylie Burp, an old bloodhound. The voice is James Stewart, one of my all-time favorites. He does the washed up old sheriff to perfection, and it's hilarious to watch him make a dog out of Tiger.OK, it's funny, it really is. It does not have the class of the original, but I liked it. So I guess what I have to do is go back and see how many stars I gave ""An American Tail,"" and give this one less. *Checks back.* No, I can't do that. If I knew how to give half stars, I'd give the original 3 1/2, and this one three.

Jimmy Stewart and Dom DeLuise are no longer with us, unfortunately. Their characters are great. Linda Ronstadt's singing is superb. You do not watch this movie for the plot. Just enjoy the super characters with wonderful voiceovers.I never saw the first or the third installment of the Fievel series, and I'm sure they are great too. I had this on video tape and have been waiting for DVD for years. My daughter loved it, but she didn't KNOW the characters like I did. If I remember correctly, Spielberg was involved in this film, which makes perfect sense why it was done so well.It is not a Pixar magic cartoon, but it is just as enjoyable as any Pixar movie ever made, and I have all of those too.

Other than that, the two stories have nothing in common, other than their both being cartoons.First of all, by the time most Ashkenazi Jews started migrating from Eastern Europe to the U.S., the Old West of lore and legend was finished.  Once you've bought into the suspension of disbelief required by this film, it's only a small stretch to imagine the family of Yekke Jewish mice relocating from the Bronx to Wyoming.  As far as Hollywood is concerned, the ""Old West"" could have been any time from ""Tippecanoe and Tyler, Too"" until ""A River Runs Through It.""Secondly, it's ""Feivel,"" not ""Fievel.""  It can even be spelled ""Feivl.""  It's a Yiddish name, and the Mousekewitz family would have written it using Hebrew letters, but there's a standard transliteration.  In ""The Joys of Yiddish,"" Leo Rosten recommended dropping the letter ""c"" whenever possible; thus, we write ""shlep,"" not ""schlep,"" and ""shlemiel,"" not ""schlemiel"" or ""schlemiehl.""  See how it works?  It's pronounced ""shle-MEE-ull,"" not ""shle-MY-ull,"" so if you spell it ""Fievel,"" it would be pronounced ""FEE-vul,"" not ""FYE-vul,"" which is the correct way.  With a name like ""Phil Nibbelink,"" the director should have been more sensitive to the correct spelling of unusual names.  Don Bluth, of course, was not involved in this one.Reportedly, the sequel where they make a pilgrimage to the Holy Land, ""A Mouse of Emmaus,"" died in development hell.",1,"Fie upon thee, Fievel",1353801600,"11 25, 2012",2012,1572,"['can', 'not', 'see', 'anything', 'depicting', 'Jews', 'mice', 'antagonists', 'cats', 'especially', 'cartoon', 'thinking', 'Art', 'Spiegelman', 'incomparable', 'Maus', 'Other', 'two', 'stories', 'have', 'nothing', 'common', 'other', 'being', 'cartoons.First', 'time', 'most', 'Ashkenazi', 'Jews', 'started', 'migrating', 'Eastern', 'Europe', 'U.S.', 'Old', 'West', 'lore', 'legend', 'was', 'finished', 'Once', ""'ve"", 'bought', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'required', 'film', 'only', 'small', 'stretch', 'imagine', 'family', 'Yekke', 'Jewish', 'mice', 'relocating', 'Bronx', 'Wyoming', 'As', 'far', 'Hollywood', 'concerned', 'Old', 'West', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'time', 'Tippecanoe', 'Tyler', 'Too', 'A', 'River', 'Runs', 'Secondly', 'Feivel', 'not', 'Fievel', 'can', 'even', 'be', 'spelled', 'Feivl', 'Yiddish', 'name', 'Mousekewitz', 'family', 'would', 'have', 'written', 'using', 'Hebrew', 'letters', 'standard', 'transliteration', 'Joys', 'Yiddish', 'Leo', 'Rosten', 'recommended', 'dropping', 'letter', 'c', 'possible', 'thus', 'write', 'shlep', 'not', 'schlep', 'shlemiel', 'not', 'schlemiel', 'schlemiehl', 'See', 'how', 'pronounced', 'shle-MEE-ull', 'not', 'shle-MY-ull', 'so', 'spell', 'Fievel', 'would', 'be', 'pronounced', 'FEE-vul', 'not', 'FYE-vul', 'correct', 'way', 'name', 'Phil', 'Nibbelink', 'director', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'sensitive', 'correct', 'spelling', 'unusual', 'names', 'Don', 'Bluth', 'course', 'was', 'not', 'involved', 'one.Reportedly', 'sequel', 'where', 'make', 'pilgrimage', 'Holy', 'Land', 'Mouse', 'Emmaus', 'died', 'development', 'hell']",N/A
