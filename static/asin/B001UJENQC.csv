This program is absolutely and completely different from the wolves in the Planet Earth series. The wolves featured in this series are primarily the druid pack in Yellowstone Park's Lamar Valley and the program focuses on their hunting in the winter, among other differences. The wolves are referred to by number, rather than by name (a little annoying to follow at times). Their stories are also well documented at [...]I will admit that the Christmas in Yellowstone is fairly worthless.

The location they focus on is in Yellowstone's Lamar Valley. The climax of the documentary is the battle between the Druids, and the Slough's. The Sough's are victorious and takes over the Druid's territory as their own.Another interesting part is where the Sough Pack chased down, and kills a coyote that had intruded into their territory, and tried to feed on their kill. The music is good and the picture quality is crystal clear. The next movie is Yellowstone in Winter, this film is also educational, and more about the landscape than the inhabitants.",5,Wolves,1363996800,"03 23, 2013",2013,705,"['Valley', 'Wolves', 'rivalry', 'two', 'wolf', 'packs', 'one', 'pack', 'called', 'Druids', 'Pack', 'other', 'called', 'Slough', 'Pack', 'location', 'focus', 'Yellowstone', 'Lamar', 'Valley', 'climax', 'documentary', 'battle', 'Druids', 'Slough', 'Sough', 'are', 'victorious', 'Druid', 'territory', 'own.Another', 'interesting', 'part', 'where', 'Sough', 'Pack', 'chased', 'down', 'coyote', 'had', 'intruded', 'territory', 'tried', 'feed', 'kill', 'music', 'good', 'picture', 'quality', 'crystal', 'clear', 'next', 'movie', 'Yellowstone', 'Winter', 'film', 'also', 'educational', 'more', 'landscape', 'inhabitants']",Nature: In the Valley of the Wolves / Christmas in Yellowstone

Nature: Yellowstone takes an intricate look at the lives of a few packs of wolves in the Yellowstone region of North America. The way in which these various packs of wolves were depicted, and the time and energy it took to follow them from season to season, really gave me the impression that whoever worked on this piece really cared about what they were filming (creating), and they were willing to take the time to make sure that their footage contained emotional content, and that it was also carefully orchestrated. Christmas in Yellowstone (program two on this DVD) was also very good, and it proved to be a good accompanying piece to program one.

It's a great family feel-good doc showing the beauty of Yellowstone around the holiday season. But ""In the Valley of the Wolves"", although beautifully shot and interesting, is definitely not for all family members. The 'harsh realities of nature' may be fine to witness for adults, but may be too intense and downright depressing for younger or more sensitive viewers. Several killings (and eating of carcasses) are portrayed, and wolf/coyote deaths are rampant.
