It's educational, full of songs,  and teaches kids that being different is fun and that being different is what makes us special. Bear and friends are great with kids.

Bear teaches values and helpful information such as seasons, shapes, colors, potty training, brushing teeth, bathing, sharing, friendship, and alot more.",4,Bear Rocks,1173139200,"03 6, 2007",2007,287,"['Bear', 'again', 'teaching', 'children', 'entertaining', 'same', 'time', 'good', 'way', 'keep', 'child', 'busy', 'learn', 'Bear', 'values', 'helpful', 'information', 'such', 'seasons', 'shapes', 'colors', 'potty', 'training', 'brushing', 'teeth', 'bathing', 'sharing', 'friendship', 'alot', 'more']",Bear in the Big Blue House - Everybody's Special
695342,A1IANEBSMVGHS9,B000063JZS,"Manny Hernandez ""@askmanny""","[15, 16]","When I saw the three episodes of ""Bear..."" on this DVD I was very impressed. I have to say it turned the series into my favorite program to share with my son.The disc starts with an episode dealing with Opposites, and it shows how important it is for opposites to exist, in order to completement us where we fall short  (Bear's chat with Tutter in the kitchen when the mouse is struggling to reach a glass, and then Bear has a hard time reaching a spoon that he dropped under the fridge are a great example of this).The second episode showcases Benny ""the bat"", a new fella to most  of the animals in the Big Blue House, which gives most of them the creeps. As Bear and Treelo introduce them to the winged friend, they begin to realize that as different as he looks, they all share something in common with him.Last, the closing episode emphasizes charity as a value, as the entire crowd in the house pulls together to organize a yardsale to benefit the muskrat's who lost their homes. Intertwined with some fun moments with Tutter's undecided about letting go some of his junk, this episode takes the whole concept home, leaving behind a trail of great benefit for your child to learn from.After this DVD, I declare myself a fan of Bear!
