722242,A2GDEPPC8BAZRY,B00006RCNY,"A. Casalino ""V^^^^^V""","[10, 10]","This movie's opening scene bears the stark ambience of impending doom, and holds onto it tenaciously for the next couple hours. I actually only saw this film because the pickings were so very slim on this past Memorial Day weekend~~~~~~~I must say I was both pleased and surprised when UNFAITHFUL far exceeded my expectations:  Here I found a subtly intense thriller where every look or little phrase spoke volumes, where the cinematography was so brilliant you could almost physically feel certain things right along with the characters: the omnipotent elements of weather - the gusting wind, the driving rain - the reckless freedom of a fast ride, the shock of a fall, a blow, a lustful touch, the sharp intake of a breath.  Diane Lane, as expected, gave a stellar performance - wherein she effortlessly mixed what would seem to be a shallow and lustful inclination with so many fathoms of depth.  You found yourself still bound to sympathize with her portrayal of Connie Sumner, an attractive and energetic housewife with an ideal life with the token ideal family - a precocious 8-year-old son with a doting father who happens also to be her caring and supporting husband.  You even come to love her in a way - in spite of the fact that she commits to a course that steamrolls her fate as well as that of those she loves best... (And I must add that I was also quite intrigued by the many very pleasing and lovely metamorphoses performed by her hair...)I was much struck, as by a lightening bolt even, by the sudden realization that Richard Gere could act!  I do say, though I'd seen him in many films upon many occasions previously, I had not ever noticed this quality so resoundingly in him before!  He delivers his portrayal of the betrayed spouse with a fearsome poignancy.  I highly doubt anyone could have played Edward Sumner quite so well as he has.  Indeed, this role was made for him!Edward is every bit the ideal husband comfortably immersed in his ideal marriage.  He runs his own company in Manhattan and indulges Connie, his active and contented wife.  Connie is very much involved in auction/fundraising work, which requires her to make frequent treks into the City.  It is upon one of these treks, on an immensely wind-gust day, that her life takes its drastic turn.In a likely twist of fate that would border on clich&eacute; if it weren't so well done, she literally runs head-on into a young, French bookseller.  Paul Martel (played adeptly by Olivier Martinez) exudes intense charm and seductive energy.  From the moment they meet, there is an almost tangible spark of sexual energy between them.  It is a spark that Connie finds herself reluctant to resist.  As like a magnet, she is drawn to him - and within days, she comes calling with her hair all done up, a lively twinkle in her eyes, and a sly smile on her face - the naughty, naughty girl!  Just before her final fall from grace, she hesitates, but by then it is too late, for Paul has already bestowed upon the touch of her fingertips poetry in Braille.I don't want to say what happens next or give any more away than I already have.  Let me only say that every scene in this film was charged with intense emotion wrought with artistic beauty.  A few of these scenes were actually breathtaking in their flawless brilliancy.UNFAITHFUL is ultimately shattering to the senses. It's a devastating depiction of one of the greatest fallibilities of human nature.  It left me sleepless - thoughtful and brooding over all the many little choices one must make in life, and how one wrong decision can take on a life of its own, perpetuating devastating consequences like a stone thrown in the river causing the ripples to radiate out all around it.",5,Powerful,1024358400,"06 18, 2002",2002,3722,"['movie', 'opening', 'scene', 'stark', 'ambience', 'impending', 'doom', 'tenaciously', 'next', 'couple', 'hours', 'actually', 'only', 'saw', 'film', 'pickings', 'were', 'so', 'very', 'slim', 'past', 'Memorial', 'Day', 'weekend~~~~~~~I', 'must', 'say', 'was', 'pleased', 'surprised', 'when', 'UNFAITHFUL', 'far', 'exceeded', 'expectations', 'Here', 'found', 'subtly', 'intense', 'thriller', 'where', 'look', 'little', 'phrase', 'spoke', 'volumes', 'where', 'cinematography', 'was', 'so', 'brilliant', 'could', 'almost', 'physically', 'feel', 'certain', 'things', 'right', 'characters', 'omnipotent', 'elements', 'weather', 'gusting', 'wind', 'driving', 'rain', 'reckless', 'freedom', 'fast', 'ride', 'shock', 'fall', 'blow', 'lustful', 'touch', 'sharp', 'intake', 'breath', 'Diane', 'Lane', 'expected', 'gave', 'stellar', 'performance', 'wherein', 'effortlessly', 'mixed', 'what', 'would', 'seem', 'be', 'shallow', 'lustful', 'inclination', 'so', 'many', 'fathoms', 'depth', 'found', 'still', 'bound', 'sympathize', 'portrayal', 'Connie', 'Sumner', 'attractive', 'energetic', 'housewife', 'ideal', 'life', 'token', 'ideal', 'family', 'precocious', '8-year-old', 'son', 'doting', 'father', 'who', 'also', 'be', 'caring', 'supporting', 'husband', 'even', 'come', 'love', 'way', 'spite', 'fact', 'course', 'fate', 'as', 'well', 'best', 'must', 'add', 'was', 'also', 'quite', 'intrigued', 'many', 'very', 'pleasing', 'lovely', 'metamorphoses', 'performed', 'hair', 'was', 'much', 'struck', 'lightening', 'bolt', 'even', 'sudden', 'realization', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'could', 'act', 'do', 'say', ""'d"", 'seen', 'many', 'films', 'many', 'occasions', 'previously', 'had', 'not', 'ever', 'noticed', 'quality', 'so', 'resoundingly', 'before', 'portrayal', 'betrayed', 'spouse', 'fearsome', 'poignancy', 'highly', 'doubt', 'anyone', 'could', 'have', 'played', 'Edward', 'Sumner', 'quite', 'so', 'well', 'Indeed', 'role', 'was', 'made', 'Edward', 'bit', 'ideal', 'husband', 'comfortably', 'immersed', 'ideal', 'marriage', 'own', 'company', 'Manhattan', 'Connie', 'active', 'contented', 'wife', 'Connie', 'very', 'much', 'involved', 'auction/fundraising', 'work', 'make', 'frequent', 'treks', 'City', 'one', 'treks', 'immensely', 'wind-gust', 'day', 'life', 'drastic', 'turn.In', 'likely', 'twist', 'fate', 'would', 'border', 'clich', 'eacute', 'were', ""n't"", 'so', 'well', 'done', 'literally', 'head-on', 'young', 'French', 'bookseller', 'Paul', 'Martel', 'played', 'adeptly', 'Olivier', 'Martinez', 'intense', 'charm', 'seductive', 'energy', 'moment', 'meet', 'almost', 'tangible', 'spark', 'sexual', 'energy', 'spark', 'Connie', 'reluctant', 'resist', 'magnet', 'drawn', 'days', 'calling', 'hair', 'done', 'up', 'lively', 'twinkle', 'eyes', 'sly', 'smile', 'face', 'naughty', 'naughty', 'girl', 'Just', 'final', 'fall', 'grace', 'then', 'too', 'late', 'Paul', 'already', 'bestowed', 'touch', 'fingertips', 'poetry', 'Braille.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'say', 'what', 'next', 'give', 'more', 'away', 'already', 'have', 'Let', 'only', 'say', 'scene', 'film', 'was', 'charged', 'intense', 'emotion', 'wrought', 'artistic', 'beauty', 'few', 'scenes', 'were', 'actually', 'breathtaking', 'flawless', 'brilliancy.UNFAITHFUL', 'ultimately', 'shattering', 'senses', 'devastating', 'depiction', 'one', 'greatest', 'fallibilities', 'human', 'nature', 'left', 'sleepless', 'thoughtful', 'brooding', 'many', 'little', 'choices', 'one', 'must', 'make', 'life', 'how', 'one', 'wrong', 'decision', 'can', 'take', 'life', 'own', 'perpetuating', 'devastating', 'consequences', 'stone', 'thrown', 'river', 'causing', 'ripples', 'radiate', 'out']",N/A
722243,A3PZR5NI1EGMP1,B00006RCNY,"A. Cooper ""possum""","[6, 6]","Unfaithful is very absorbing and fun to watch; it careens from a sexy drama to a murder drama, and doesn't skip a beat. Diane Lane is excellent, and Richard Gere (in a much more subtle performance) is outstanding. Olivier Martinez doesn't get a chance to do all that much acting-wise, but he's quite handsome to look at.What is frustrating are the things that make no sense. Why in the world did Connie cheat on her husband? When Edward finally confronts her and she starts to explain, he tells her he doesn't want to hear it. Fine for him -- but I sure did!! It's also frustrating that Connie could be such an UNBELIEVABLY rotten liar, and get away with stuff so easily. She tells the cops she's never been in her lover's apartment, and doesn't know when she last saw him. Uh, Connie, there are these little things nowadays called fingerprints and dna... perhaps you've heard of them? Not to mention that she attacked her lover's girl friend in a library, where probably a hundred people saw her being pulled out. What was taking so long for her to be taken downtown? It's also frustrating that her son can't ask what they're having for breakfast without Connie flashing her husband a ""isn't he just the cutest kid?"" look that becomes nauseating after a while.Still, the music is lovely, the movie is very well made, the acting is quite good, and there are some wonderfully silent and subtle scenes that speak volumes with their poignancy (a rarity in film lately). So grab the popcorn, turn out the lights, and enjoy -- but don't look for too many answers, because you'll be left with even more questions.Oh, one more thing... do you want to avoid Connie's pitfalls and her resulting downfalls (literal and not?)

722246,A3C6X0DAM87GN4,B00006RCNY,Alex Udvary,"[5, 7]","If you were in a long lasting marriage or a long term relationship do you think if the oppertunity presented itself you would ever cheat on your spouse? Do you think you would ever act on a feeling of lust you feel in one moment? That's a theme that is under the surface of ""Unfaithful"", the new film directed by Adrian Lyne, based on the Claude Chabrol film ""La Femme Infidele"".As much as I wanted to like ""Unfaithful"" I just felt cheated even disappointed. The opening moments, infact, the first hour of the film seem so utterly pointless, it seems to be handled so badly that by the time something interesting does happen, we've been sitting in the theatre so long, we're already bored, waiting for the film to end.If that isn't bad enough, we can't figure out why Diane Lane starts to have an affair. She has a beautiful house in the country, from what I hear woman say, being married to Richard Gere isn't a bad thing either, and she has a son. Everything seems just about perfect in her life, but for some unexplainable reason, Lane acts on that ""lust for the moment"" feeling she gets. This is what breaks the film. Why would she jeopardize her whole life with her family with this other man played by Oliver Martinez (Who acted in the 1996 film, ""The Horseman on the Roof"").I don't like movies where I'm suppose to sympathize with a woman when she cheats on her husband, because I know if it was done in reverse, no one would ever find the situation to be romantic, or take the man's side. But, if your going to make a movie like this, then at least come up with a reason as to why the woman is doing it!""Unfaithful"" does have it's good sides, which is what makes it hard for me not to be able to recommend this movie. Richard Gere and Diane Lane turn in very good performances. And, Gere really out does himself. The directing is strong, and Lyne has a way of telling the story in a way where we are never ""really"" bored, but, the film never reaches it's potential I thought. ""Unfaithful"" could of been a great film, I looked forward to seeing it for a while, but, the movie escapes itself. It's ideas don't seem to be half as involving as the film wants us to think it is.I'm really bothed by the fact that a movie about a woman having an affair on her husband with a younger man doesn't explain itself as to why she does it. I wasn't satisfied with it's....""well, she just acted on an impuse."" answer. I wanted something more. A missed oppertunity.  ** 1\2 out of *****Bottom-line: A Nicely done film with good acting, but, never hits the high levels it sets for itself.

722248,A9Z4C6SSRUL0E,B00006RCNY,A. Liu,"[2, 3]","None of the ideas in ""Unfaithful"" is new or ground-breaking, and at times it does make you feel ""I'm sure I've seen it somewhere..."", some may think, and rightfully so, that this is just another fantasized Hollywood version of the life of a suburban wife. Yet there is no denying that ""Unfaithful"" is actually a compelling film.Its drawn-out premise was the reason I refused to go to the theatrical release when my partner asked me to. Eventually I got a chance to watch it, and although I was not blown away by it, I was quite surprised by how much it echoed in my mind a few days after I watched it.Many people complained about how unrealistic it is for a middle-age wife to be as gorgeous as Lane, and what a rare chance it could be to run into a foreign language speaking pretty boy. True, but if without the attractive cast to satisfy the more general viewers (quote ""Diane Lane naked""), without the additive flavor of sexual fantasy (more than often I heard girls remarking the French boy being ""so cute""!), I doubt this movie would have been as successful, financially, of course.The truth is, why Connie (Lane) would fall for the book-selling Paul in the first place is questionable. She has a seemingly perfect family, and more importantly her husband (maturely played by Richard Gere) is loving, caring and affectionate. Also, since Paul's sexual intention was so bluntly obvious, and a devoted mother and wife as Lane was trying to portrait would unable resist is quite unconvincing. However, after Connie and Paul's first rendezvous, the whole movie switches gear from escapism fantasy, to plausible human drama (not saying that it did not change back in the third act). After nearly two decades of being a ""playboy"", Gere recently shows us what he could do as a performer. His character shows everything an ideal husband could be, with enough dignity and maturity you actually feel for him along the story down to the very last minute. Lane's performance of Connie, who confuses love with lust, is delicately spot-on. The surfacing of her internal struggle is both despiteful and heart-aching. We almost enjoy watching her being tormented, but also desperately hope to linger on that slightest hope that she may be forgiven. The only big exception among the cast is Oliver Martinez. As Paul Martel, he does not have the presence of an exotic, mysterious lover Lane's character would have us believed that she fell for. Instead, he came off as a sleazy, shallow young boy who indulges himself in adolescence's wet dream, whose main concern is picking women with some book tricks so he can go to bed with them (uh...seems like he is speaking for majority of male population today). His worst sin is that, he will have most of the males believe that it is okay sleep around, it is even a good idea to conclude an argument or cover up your mistake for a pseudo-rape sex, since the opposite sex has no dignity or choice of their own. It is also okay to seduce any women if you have the face, as long as you are not stupid enough to confront their husbands. Perhaps that is what we are supposed to feel, but that is also one of the very few places that fails to make ""Unfaithful"" a faithful and plausible human study.Watching ""Unfaithful"" is like witnessing the clash between the traditional family value, the moral conscience that defines us as civilized humans, versus the overrated liberation of sexuality that has corrupted so many goods in our society today. The sex scenes are not overly gratuitous, started off titillating and gradually became more realistic, to disturbingly tedious, reminiscing Connie affair, and ultimately her life. Like mentioned above, there are really no new topics that have not been covered before. But under Lyne's direction and strong performance form the lead casts, we are somehow spellbound to watch a tragedy unfold. Even when the inevitable revenge occurs, we felt as confused and complicated as the characters.

But, hey, you can never get enough good, classy erotica.  Diane Lane gives a stunning performance as the wife of Richard Gere.  So strenuous were the sex scenes, that she herniated a disc on her back during filming.  Now that's dedication to the job.Let's get back to the movie.  I don't think this film is as suspenseful as Fatal Attraction.  But to me, it does delve more into the dynamics of family life and what it means to be faithful and committed to the family.

I think if a married couple is open about their relationship and would enjoy a good discussion afterwards, then this film is a good choice.

722252,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00006RCNY,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 3]","My defiant support of this film was probably spawned from the atrocity that was Diane Lane's Oscar loss back at the 2002 Academy Awards.  Yes, Nicole Kidman is a great actress who delivered a decent portrayal of Virginia Woolf, but honestly, there was not one performance in any category that year that rivaled that of Diane Lane.  Over the years though I have been able to separate my love for her performance from my feelings towards the film, and what I've found is that this movie as a whole misses the mark and is really only bolstered by the power within Lane's dynamic performance.The film is quite generic; married woman meets intriguing stranger who entices her into a lurid affair that threatens the fibers of her marriage.  We've seen this many times before (even within the same year we were given `The Good Girl', which as a whole was a better film yet lacked the brilliance that was Lane) but what disappointed me most about `Unfaithful' is that it didn't really execute the film all that great.  Aside from Lane there really isn't anything extraordinary here, not in the acting and not in the script.  I'll give the direction some love since it really grabs you in moments and pains this secluded picture of claustrophobia, which helps elevate the audience's grasp of the emotional state Constance is going through.  The film is nicely shot, but it lacks any real substance to help elevate it above the average infidelity thriller.The script is probably the biggest culprit here, giving the audience nothing to be too excited about.  The plot twist involving the `murder' is really a stretch and in my opinion drags the movie down that clich&eacute;d road of no return.  Oliver Martinez doesn't help the film much either.  He's a rather dull actor who comes off somewhat silly in most of his scenes.  Richard Gere (another actor I've never truly `gotten') does his best to rise above his characters setbacks, but he eventually falls victim.Yes, Diane Lane is really the only member of the acting team who walks away unscathed, which is really another testament to her tremendous performance, for even when she is faced with rather mediocre dialog she owns it in a way that sells it as legit to the audience.The film does soar in some areas though, which is really why I'm rather torn when I discuss this movie.  Yes, it winds up feeling stale when you take in the entire gist of the film, plot holes and all; but when you separate the segments that feature Lane and her characters gradual breakdown you can't help but see where this film makes sense.  The film really fleshes out Constance in a way that a lot of these genre films aren't able to (yet another testament to Lane's brilliance).  We can see the entire workings of this affair in her head and it draws us to her.  We see her struggle with her motherly duties and we see the way this affair makes her feel free.  This film soars in the area where `Notes on a Scandal' failed (in fleshing out the unfaithful party) yet fails in area where `Notes on a Scandal' soared (in delivering a highly engrossing film).  When we see Constance attack Paul in the library after catching him with another woman we feel her pain, yet we are not immune to her lack of morality.  We know she is wrong yet with sympathize with her, not out of lackadaisical morals but out of desperate understanding.Connie is a real woman to us.So, the film itself would get a C from me, maybe even a C-, but Diane Lane alone deserves an A+ (I remember watching the film with my wife and during the first love scene my wife turned to me and said ""is she quivering"" and it was right there that I said ""this girl deserves like twenty Oscars for this"") and her iconic performance is not only the greatest `cheating spouse' portrayal like ever, it elevates the overall appeal of this film drastically.  Like I said, I defiantly supported this mediocrity based on her stunning performance alone for so long.

At least I did not feel it was so.BASIC STORY:Diane Lane is the happily married mid-forties woman who accidentally meets a young incredibly attractive man in his 20s who, is obviously attracted and interested in her.  Her husband Richard Gere is a cuddly lovable, happily married and successful man.  What really blows you away, is why would she stray? Oh yeah, this young man is drop dead gorgeous, sexy and is patiently interested in her..  Deadly combination.This young man, is like light to the moth of Diane Lane's character and she keeps coming back despite the potential harm to her family.  Since she is doing such a shoddy job of hiding her involvement, in her intensity to see this young man, Richard Gere's character begins to suspect something.INTERESTING COUNTERPOINT:At one point in the movie, Diane Lane's character is seen by some friends in the young man's neighborhood and she is forced to have lunch with them to allay suspicions.  Olivier Martinez's character comes to the restaurant to have a dailliance in the back with Diane Lane's character, while she is supposedly in the ladies room.  However, these ladies in conversation make it quite clear when they see Olivier Martinez that they feel he is wildly attractive.  One even goes as far to say, she would go to bed with him in a second.  The other, is wilting while recalling a former affair that she has had and its devastation.  Diane Lane's character is forced to see both sides of the coin.ACTING AND ACTION ARE INTENSE:There are some pretty steamy scenes in this movie.  Diane Lane does an excellent job also of showing both her mixed feelings and reckless abandon. You see her maniacly pursuing this forbidden relationship, once it is is started.  Richard Gere is great as the devoted husband.  He is playful and lovable, but not stupid. He does everything he can to understand what is going on, until he has proof in his hands.  Olivier Martinez, is one very attractive and compeling young man.  I'm sure we will see him even more in Hollywood (in English speaking films) now that he has done this movie.

Richard Gere wasn't just aging gracefully in those movies, he was THE STAR, and he used those two movies to make himself into the first successful grey haired leading man since Cary Grant in the 1960s.But for some reason then somebody told him to die his hair brown for a series of duds, and by the time he went grey again in RUNAWAY BRIDE his tank seemed to be on empty, and now he's back with brown hair again in UNFAITHFUL, and he doesn't come across as a jealous older man, just as an old man with his hair dyed brown, sort of like how Harrison Ford was starting to look in his last Tom Clancy movies.  Diane Lane is excellent as Gere's unfaithful wife, and newcomer Oliver Martinez is sensational in a similar role to Gere's small but important breakout part in LOOKING OUT FOR MR. GOODBAR--this time to seduce Gere's wife, talk about turnabout being fair play!--but when UNFAITHFUL changes from being an interesting affair into a murder, the fact that the most interesting character in the movie is dead is really bad news for Lane, Gere, and the moviegoers, because it's all downhill from there.And I don't know if a better story or a different role for Richard Gere would make a difference, because THE OLD GREY GERE AIN'T WHAT HE USED TO BE!!!",2,THE OLD GREY GERE AIN'T WHAT HE USED TO BE!!!,1024617600,"06 21, 2002",2002,1635,"['saw', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'days', 'first', 'comeback', 'late', '1980s', '1990s', 'movies', 'PRETTY', 'WOMAN', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'INTERNAL', 'AFFAIRS', 'Andy', 'Garcia', 'know', 'how', 'good', 'can', 'be', 'grey', 'haired', 'older', 'man', 'romantically', 'pursuing', 'single', 'woman', 'be', 'wife', 'PRETTY', 'WOMAN', 'boldly', 'sleeping', 'someone', 'else', 'INTERNAL', 'AFFAIRS', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'was', ""n't"", 'just', 'aging', 'gracefully', 'movies', 'was', 'THE', 'STAR', 'used', 'two', 'movies', 'make', 'first', 'successful', 'grey', 'haired', 'leading', 'man', 'Cary', 'Grant', '1960s.But', 'reason', 'then', 'somebody', 'told', 'die', 'hair', 'brown', 'series', 'duds', 'time', 'went', 'grey', 'again', 'RUNAWAY', 'BRIDE', 'tank', 'seemed', 'be', 'empty', 'now', 'back', 'brown', 'hair', 'again', 'UNFAITHFUL', ""n't"", 'come', 'jealous', 'older', 'man', 'just', 'old', 'man', 'hair', 'dyed', 'brown', 'sort', 'how', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'was', 'starting', 'look', 'last', 'Tom', 'Clancy', 'movies', 'Diane', 'Lane', 'excellent', 'Gere', 'unfaithful', 'wife', 'newcomer', 'Oliver', 'Martinez', 'sensational', 'similar', 'role', 'Gere', 'small', 'important', 'part', 'LOOKING', 'OUT', 'MR.', 'GOODBAR', 'time', 'seduce', 'Gere', 'wife', 'talk', 'turnabout', 'being', 'fair', 'play', 'when', 'UNFAITHFUL', 'changes', 'being', 'interesting', 'affair', 'murder', 'fact', 'most', 'interesting', 'character', 'movie', 'dead', 'really', 'bad', 'news', 'Lane', 'Gere', 'moviegoers', 'downhill', 'there.And', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'better', 'story', 'different', 'role', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'would', 'make', 'difference', 'THE', 'OLD', 'GREY', 'GERE', 'AI', ""N'T"", 'WHAT', 'HE', 'USED', 'TO', 'BE']",N/A

Connie (Diane Lane) and Edward (Richard Gere) seem to be from the very beginning of the movie a kind of mismatch couple. It looks like everything is not peaches and cream in their marriage and possibly the only reason that they are still together is because of the son that they share. Even before Connie meets and gets sexually involve with Olivier Martinez, you can sense that something is not right in her life she seems kind of sad and nostalgic especially when her husband is around. I can't say that I really blame Connie for looking for something outside of her marriage when it is obvious that she does not have it at home with her husband. Diane Lane is not only sexy and beautiful but gives a powerhouse performance that resulted in her nabbing an Oscar nomination as Best Actress for her outstanding work in this film. A highly underrated actress in my opinion she more than prove to Hollywood that she is a brilliant talent to be reckoned with. Richard Gere has his good moments in this film but overall his character is too vulnerable at times and although you feel sorry for him that his wife cheated on him it is Diane that I found myself rooting for through out the whole movie. I don't want too give too much away for those you who still may not have seen it. This is a great movie with an excellent cast and wonderful performances by everyone but as I said it is the sexy and divine Diane Lane that steals every scene from her co-star husband and from everyone else for that matter. I recommend this movie all the way and maybe you can draw your own conclusion if you think that Connie did right or wrong in having an affair outside of the marriage.

A chance encounter with a young Parisian book dealer on a surrealistically windy day leads her irresistably astray. The way she is played by the charming Ms Lane makes her surprisingly sympathetic. You know that what she is doing is wrong, and she has no excuse other than boredom, but you kind of hope that she can just have her fling, see the error of her way, and go back to her son and husband.Connie Sumner: We could end this now and nobody would get hurtPaul: I'd get hurt.It is a testament to her acting that the audience feels such sympathy. Indeed, Lane's career has had its ups and downs, but this role was definitely a high point, earning her an Oscar nomination. Her path has crossed with co star Richard Gere before, and would again, but if Unfaithful was her zenith, then The Cotton Club, also with Richard Gere, was her nadir. She was nominated for a Razzie Award for that one.[First Line]Charlie: Dad, look what I can do. I've been practicing[Makes fart noise with armpit]All in all, Unfaithful worked out pretty well for all concerned. Director Adrian Lynne always makes a big impact, but often his biggest box office successes are met with critical disdain: Flashdance, Fatal Attraction, Nine 1/2 Weeks, In Unfaitful the direction is almost over-the-top at points, but it all works in the service of the story, creating strong moods and conjuring strong emotions. Diane Lane's performance was also well controlled, subtle, actually, even though she ran the gamut of emotions. Her son, played by Erik Per Sullivan, the youngest kid from Malcolm in the Middle, did a great job. Richard Gere was understated at first, letting Lane do the heavy lifting, until the time came for him to explode. Olivier Martinez, who played Connie Sumner's lover Paul Martel, was perfect for the part. The Bottom Line is that Unfaithful is kind of a chick flick, but it was really well done. It can be enjoyed by people of either gender who enjoy a good drama about the consequences of infidelity.Connie Sumner: I think this was a mistake.Paul: There is no such thing as a mistake.

Why she had an affair was not explained in the film but it was probably because of the usual: bored with suburban soccer mom life, bored having sex with the same guy, bored with routine daily life.  Sure she's pretty and ""has everything"", but she may still feel uninspired, rightly so or not.When one spouse is having an affair, domestic life WILL BE different.  Edward and the son both noticed small things that were jarring here and there until Edward couldn't ignore the bothering feeling any longer.In the mean time, viewers see Connie went from soccer mom get-up to increasingly sexy and feminine ""tryst"" outfits to finally, after she decided to end the affair, back to soccer mom sweather and jeans...This film can also serve as a cautionary tale: never to boast that an affair will never happen in your marriage, to you, or to your spouse.  It never happens because the temptation hasn't been strong enough.Although most affairs may not end so tragically like in the film but the damage to a marriage (or the trust between the spouses) is almost always permanant.Hopefully those who've seen the film will think long and hard before ""letting that cab go"".....",4,clues in small places...,1117411200,"05 30, 2005",2005,1340,"['film', 'not', 'perfect', 'film', 'moments.A', 'seemingly', 'happy', 'marriage', '10', 'years', 'couple', 'can', 'communicate', 'words', 'such', 'Connie', 'Edward', 'case', 'Why', 'had', 'affair', 'was', 'not', 'explained', 'film', 'was', 'probably', 'usual', 'bored', 'suburban', 'soccer', 'mom', 'life', 'bored', 'having', 'sex', 'same', 'guy', 'bored', 'routine', 'daily', 'life', 'Sure', 'pretty', 'everything', 'may', 'still', 'feel', 'uninspired', 'rightly', 'so', 'not.When', 'one', 'spouse', 'having', 'affair', 'domestic', 'life', 'WILL', 'BE', 'different', 'Edward', 'son', 'noticed', 'small', 'things', 'were', 'jarring', 'here', 'there', 'Edward', 'could', ""n't"", 'ignore', 'bothering', 'feeling', 'mean', 'time', 'viewers', 'see', 'Connie', 'went', 'soccer', 'mom', 'get-up', 'increasingly', 'sexy', 'feminine', 'tryst', 'outfits', 'finally', 'decided', 'end', 'affair', 'back', 'soccer', 'mom', 'sweather', 'jeans', 'film', 'can', 'also', 'serve', 'cautionary', 'tale', 'never', 'boast', 'affair', 'will', 'never', 'happen', 'marriage', 'spouse', 'never', 'temptation', ""n't"", 'been', 'strong', 'enough.Although', 'most', 'affairs', 'may', 'not', 'end', 'so', 'tragically', 'film', 'damage', 'marriage', 'trust', 'spouses', 'almost', 'always', 'permanant.Hopefully', 'who', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'film', 'will', 'think', 'long', 'hard', 'letting', 'cab', 'go', '..']",N/A

722273,A29IYGR7SNPRIV,B00006RCNY,"Charlotte Vale-Allen ""writerinresidence""","[2, 5]","I'm beginning to wish that one-time director of TV commercials Lyne weren't quite so addicted to the issue of male-female relationships, particularly adultery. It's somewhat shocking that the same man who directed the highly entertaining Flashdance and the powerful Jacob's Ladder has also done at least three films dealing with marital betrayal: Fatal Attraction (oh, please!), Indecent Proposal (you have got to be kidding!) and now Unfaithful. He never seems to know how to end these films, so they go on, seemingly for hours.What rescues this latest look at adultery is Diane Lane's performance. Lane has always been better than the majority of films in which she's appeared. This time out, she hits it right on the money--deservingly nominated for an Academy Award. Gere is considerably less believable as the husband for whom integrity is everything. (It's interesting that he pulls a hat trick in Chicago but wasn't nominated for, arguably, the best performance of his career.)Erik Per Sullivan is lovely as the son of this couple; a child actor who actually looks like a real kid. And Olivier Martinez is hugely appealing as the young Frenchman Lane finds so compellingly attractive.Ultimately, the wheels come off this vehicle and it hits the wall. It just doesn't want to end; there are three, four, five intimitations that it's finally over. But, no. On it goes. And the final scene, perhaps meant to leave us wondering, merely leaves us relieved that this movie, at last, has come to an end.Definitely worth seeing for Diane Lane, and for some lovely cinematography.

722274,AKVU4HUG6AN1U,B00006RCNY,"""chick_flick""","[2, 2]","""Unfaithful"", directed by Adrian Lyne, tells the story of one's unfaithfulness to their marriage, and the consequences of the act when their spouse finds out about the affair.PLOT SUMMARY: Connie Sumner (Diane Lane) is a married woman in her thirties or forties who seems to have everything--good looks, a wealthy husband, Edward (Richard Gere), a nice, big house, and a charming son, Charlie (Erik Per Sullivan). Connie, however, thinks her married life is failing in ... intercourse with her husband, who seems to have lots of time for his career but no time for her. And when Connie is nearly forced into the arms of a young, French man, Paul Martel (Olivier Martinez), on a windy day in New York City, her whole life changes. Now Connie and Paul are lovers in a very steamy relationship. A few months go by, and Edward becomes suspicious of Connie and her ""strange habbits"". To find out what is going on with his wife, he sends a friend off to spy on her when he goes away on a business trip. The spy catches Connie with Paul on camera, and Edward becomes bitter with jealousy, so jealous, that he murders Paul. Now Edward must confront Connie with her affair and together, they must learn to deal with it for the rest of their lives.MY OVERALL THOUGHTS: I thought ""Unfaithful"" was a brilliant film. Diane Lane is superb, solid, ... as the unfaithful Connie. Richard Gere and Olivier Martinez are also superb in their roles as the two men in Connie's life. Richard Gere is especially brilliant in the scenes when he feels guilty over Paul's murder. The ... scenes were wonderfully portrayed and looked extremely real, maybe almost too real, because I kept thinking to myself, ""Oh, my God! Are they using condoms or birth pills?!"" The storyline is solid writing, with an interesting ending and strong dialouge. The music is haunting and the directing is terrific. The DVD includes a nice set of features such as, an audio commentary by the director, eleven deleted scenes, an alternate ending, actor's commentary, a guest show interview with the cast and director, behind-scenes featurette, and cast interviews. This film is available in both wide screen and full frame format DVDs.I highly recommend ""Unfaithful"".Score:100/100A+",5,... sensational.,1048636800,"03 26, 2003",2003,2232,"['Unfaithful', 'directed', 'Adrian', 'Lyne', 'story', 'one', 'unfaithfulness', 'marriage', 'consequences', 'act', 'when', 'spouse', 'out', 'affair.PLOT', 'SUMMARY', 'Connie', 'Sumner', 'Diane', 'Lane', 'married', 'woman', 'thirties', 'forties', 'who', 'have', 'everything', 'good', 'looks', 'wealthy', 'husband', 'Edward', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'nice', 'big', 'house', 'charming', 'son', 'Charlie', 'Erik', 'Per', 'Sullivan', 'Connie', 'however', 'married', 'life', 'failing', 'intercourse', 'husband', 'who', 'have', 'lots', 'time', 'career', 'time', 'when', 'Connie', 'nearly', 'forced', 'arms', 'young', 'French', 'man', 'Paul', 'Martel', 'Olivier', 'Martinez', 'windy', 'day', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'whole', 'life', 'changes', 'Now', 'Connie', 'Paul', 'are', 'lovers', 'very', 'steamy', 'relationship', 'few', 'months', 'go', 'Edward', 'suspicious', 'Connie', 'strange', 'habbits', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'going', 'wife', 'friend', 'spy', 'when', 'away', 'business', 'trip', 'spy', 'Connie', 'Paul', 'camera', 'Edward', 'bitter', 'jealousy', 'so', 'jealous', 'Paul', 'Now', 'Edward', 'must', 'confront', 'Connie', 'affair', 'together', 'must', 'learn', 'deal', 'rest', 'lives.MY', 'OVERALL', 'THOUGHTS', 'thought', 'Unfaithful', 'was', 'brilliant', 'film', 'Diane', 'Lane', 'superb', 'solid', 'unfaithful', 'Connie', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'Olivier', 'Martinez', 'are', 'also', 'superb', 'roles', 'two', 'men', 'Connie', 'life', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'especially', 'brilliant', 'scenes', 'when', 'guilty', 'Paul', 'murder', 'scenes', 'were', 'wonderfully', 'portrayed', 'looked', 'extremely', 'real', 'maybe', 'almost', 'too', 'real', 'kept', 'thinking', 'myself', 'Oh', 'God', 'Are', 'using', 'condoms', 'birth', 'pills', 'storyline', 'solid', 'writing', 'interesting', 'ending', 'strong', 'dialouge', 'music', 'haunting', 'directing', 'terrific', 'DVD', 'nice', 'set', 'features', 'such', 'audio', 'commentary', 'director', 'eleven', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'alternate', 'ending', 'actor', 'commentary', 'guest', 'show', 'interview', 'cast', 'director', 'behind-scenes', 'featurette', 'cast', 'interviews', 'film', 'available', 'wide', 'screen', 'full', 'frame', 'format', 'DVDs.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'Unfaithful', '.Score:100/100A+']",N/A

I don't think so. The beginning of the film is her having sex for no reason other than to have sex. They hardly bonded in front of our eyes. There was a magnetic attraction, but we didn't see it. This film could have substituted some of the sex, especially the hallway scene (what were they thinking?) for some more plot and story line progression. The film didn't seem to take any shape until Richard Gere killed what's his name. Might I add, he was quite ugly, irritatiing to listen to and just too audacious a character. All in all, it's not bad, but it could certainly have been better. If ever there was a film that had too much sex in it, this is it. It's just unnecessary. There was so much room for plot progression that the movie is so full of holes.

It's not a review but good advice and much more helpful than some of the others.Ok.. my take on the movie is this:Richard Gere is as good as it gets, he can express more with his face and eyes than most actors can with a film full of dialogue. You can read it in his face, the sense of betrayal and heartbreak which turns to anger and desperation with one quickly placed eyebrow. Diane Lane on the other hand, seems to be pumped full of tranquilizer. She remains expressionless the entire film, and I lost interest in her character. I really wanted to see her get mad and pound his chest and say ""How could you do this!!!""..but she handles the whole thing while being careful to use her indoor voice. Boring!! I started hoping she would be falsely charged with the murder and Edward would stay silent, getting his revenge and moving on with someone else.I also think the child element was a tad unnecessary except to make her cheating more deplorable. It needed a deeper twist such as ""Edward"" being responsible for their child's accidental death and her cheating out of anger; Or her becoming pregnant with the new guys baby after years of infertility with ""Edward"". That to me would be more of a breaking point for killing the guy than just finding out she gave him a crummy second hand gift that her husband gave her.I would have loved to see a big blow up, maybe in front of the kid causing him to run out and get hurt or worse.. well that's bad I know but better drama than what goes down.

So as many know, the story is about an unfaithful spouse, and it's really not much more than that, but what makes this so great is the desection you get of the human emotions involved.  You see both Diane Lane and Richard Gere stripped of their cheary selves and get to see pure emotions.  The first sexual encounter between Diane Lane and her seducer Olivier Martinez, you can real feel her resistance.  She's shaking so badly, she knows she doing somthing wrong yet she doesn't know how to say no.  It's unsettling if you've ever had a mate cheat, so I guess stay away if thats the case, but it's really a great movie to watch if you want to see pure emotion.  Gere does an amazing job as a tortured husband dealing with his wifes straying, but it all boils down to Lane as she tackles the role of the adultress.

Connie Summer (Diane Lane) is a woman with far too much time on her hands.  Her husband Edward (Richard Gere) easily earns enough money to support the family in an upper middle class lifestyle.  Connie only has oneboy and no serious avocations to focus upon.  She is an attractive and bored woman approaching middle age.  In other words, Connie is a walking time bomb waiting to go off.  Connie literally runs into the much younger Paul during a windy afternoon in Manhattan.  One thing leads to another, and eventually Connie ends up in Paul's bed.  The odds are highly against this become a lasting relationship,  but Connie enjoys the lustful encounters and isn't particularly interested in thinking about the distant future.  The pleasure sectors of her brain now dominate the analytical. Practical questions can wait to be answered on another day.Edward wasn't born yesterday and quickly realizes that something is amiss.  We follow the unfolding events knowing full well something tragic is about to occur.  The dialogue is near perfect, and the acting superb.  Diane Lane is brilliant and this may be the best work that Gere has done in a number of years. Director Adrian Lyne's approach is thoroughly secular.  These characters display no religious inclinations.  Nonetheless,  the awfulness of adultery comes across loud and clear.  This is an act of betrayal that almost certainly will severely damage, if not completely destroy a marital relationship.  Do you really wish to take that risk?

She treads a tightrope between temptation and staying loyal to her husband Edward (Richard Gere). She is powerless to the attraction and her sensual awakening - and thus the illicit affair continues - with devastating results to her marriage and family...The first half of the movie is elegantly controlled with beautiful direction from Lyne. His metaphorism through the gale to signal a whirlwind affair and constant shots of Connie's marriage ring to hint of her moral dilemma is sublime. His sensual erotic style titillates through intimate camera angles yet is aptly restraint without frontal nudity. Yet the more surprising revelation is Diane Lane who tunes her performance as the adulteress to a virtuoso mode. She is what that clinches the movie - through her emotional turmoil and guilt with her ecstasy to unravel the moral quandry. Richard Gere plays the anguished husband with straight bitterness; Martinez oozes charm in the role of a seducer.The movie unfortunately cannot handle the complications seriously which is blown to mythic proportions by a murder subplot that crumbles the emotional intensity. It rapidly spins to a predictible mode where it becomes overly dramatic and ridiculous, leaving the ending to the interpretation of the audience.

722298,A38UHOCEKSUOSP,B00006RCNY,"dominion_ruler ""Bryan""","[1, 1]","I really enjoy this film, even after multiple vewings it is still effective.  The key is great performances with attention to detail, especially from Diane Lane.  The story too, is well written, also bringing out attention to details and the affair is just half of the tale, as an unexpected event turns things around half-way through the film, releasing a lot of tension, suspision, and unfaithfulness.One might expect that Unfaithful is about a wife cheating on her husband (been done before and the cover art of the case gives this away).  This is only half of the film, which makes it a fine product altogether.  However, the first half of the film is well accomplished.  We are introduced to the Sumner family, husband Ed (Richard Gere), wife Connie (Diane Lane) and young son of about 8 years of age, Charlie (Erik Per Sullivan).  They live quitely, comfortably in the suburbs in a beautiful white house, picket fence etc etc.  Everything is fine and for the most part the family is happy.  Ed works a lot like most husbands, and one might believe too much work can lead to his wife's affair.  Not so true.  He does a fine job of balancing work and family, spending a lot of time with his boy and equally with his wife, in a variety of tender & romantic encounters.  Connie seems happy but accidently bumps into Paul Martel (Olivier Martinez) on the street one day.  He invites her to his place for a minute, she stays briefly.  Slowly and cautiously, Connie revisits, fighting with herself whether to conintue the visits or let it be.  She visits one too many times, eventually finding herself romantically involved and addicted soonafter.  Yet at the same time, she still spends time with her family, and having fun.  Eventually she begins to break down, realizing she doesn't need this and realizing her husband has always been good to her.  But they always end in disaster, one of her friends states, about affairs.Connie gets the soptlight in the film, especially in the first half, along with Paul (though there is little exploration to his character, but the story focus is ment to be on Connie).  Ed gets his chance in the second half of the film, when he encounters Paul and an unexpected turn of events occur, haunting him (Ed) for the rest of the film.  It is at this point when the title ""Unfaithful"" is at it's ripest form.  Suspense is finally at its climax, as suspicions begin to rise both from husband and wife.Unfaithful could have been a suspense thriller, but it is not.  While there are some moments of anger, and a bit of hatred, Unfaithful actually has a very romantic and touching quality to it.  This is very evident in the soundtrack, which is light piano accompanied by a bit of strings throughout most of the film.  The ending scene wasn't very sharp, but the end of the film up to that point actually surpirsed me, in a good way.  I enjoyed seeing acts of love and forgiveness at work.  While Unfaithful contains a lot of sexuality, it is not that kind of film.  There is a rather deeper meaning at play here, performances and story are strong enough, that it might just make you think twice about cheating, and maybe recognize the better parts of a beautiful marriage.Acting - 4.5Charcaters - 4Drama - 4.5Story - 4Overall - 4.5",4,[4.5] It always ends in disaster,1222128000,"09 23, 2008",2008,3263,"['really', 'enjoy', 'film', 'even', 'multiple', 'vewings', 'still', 'effective', 'key', 'great', 'performances', 'attention', 'detail', 'especially', 'Diane', 'Lane', 'story', 'too', 'well', 'written', 'also', 'bringing', 'out', 'attention', 'details', 'affair', 'just', 'half', 'tale', 'unexpected', 'event', 'things', 'half-way', 'film', 'releasing', 'lot', 'tension', 'suspision', 'unfaithfulness.One', 'might', 'expect', 'Unfaithful', 'wife', 'cheating', 'husband', 'been', 'done', 'cover', 'art', 'case', 'away', 'only', 'half', 'film', 'fine', 'product', 'altogether', 'However', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'well', 'accomplished', 'are', 'introduced', 'Sumner', 'family', 'husband', 'Ed', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'wife', 'Connie', 'Diane', 'Lane', 'young', 'son', '8', 'years', 'age', 'Charlie', 'Erik', 'Per', 'Sullivan', 'live', 'quitely', 'comfortably', 'suburbs', 'beautiful', 'white', 'house', 'picket', 'fence', 'etc', 'etc', 'Everything', 'fine', 'most', 'part', 'family', 'happy', 'Ed', 'lot', 'most', 'husbands', 'one', 'might', 'believe', 'too', 'much', 'work', 'can', 'lead', 'wife', 'affair', 'Not', 'so', 'true', 'fine', 'job', 'balancing', 'work', 'family', 'spending', 'lot', 'time', 'boy', 'equally', 'wife', 'variety', 'tender', 'romantic', 'encounters', 'Connie', 'happy', 'accidently', 'Paul', 'Martel', 'Olivier', 'Martinez', 'street', 'one', 'day', 'place', 'minute', 'briefly', 'Slowly', 'cautiously', 'Connie', 'fighting', 'conintue', 'visits', 'let', 'be', 'one', 'too', 'many', 'times', 'eventually', 'finding', 'romantically', 'involved', 'addicted', 'soonafter', 'same', 'time', 'still', 'time', 'family', 'having', 'fun', 'Eventually', 'break', 'down', 'realizing', ""n't"", 'need', 'realizing', 'husband', 'always', 'been', 'good', 'always', 'end', 'disaster', 'one', 'friends', 'states', 'about', 'affairs.Connie', 'soptlight', 'film', 'especially', 'first', 'half', 'Paul', 'little', 'exploration', 'character', 'story', 'focus', 'ment', 'be', 'Connie', 'Ed', 'chance', 'second', 'half', 'film', 'when', 'Paul', 'unexpected', 'turn', 'events', 'occur', 'haunting', 'Ed', 'rest', 'film', 'point', 'when', 'title', 'Unfaithful', 'ripest', 'form', 'Suspense', 'finally', 'climax', 'suspicions', 'begin', 'rise', 'husband', 'wife.Unfaithful', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'suspense', 'thriller', 'not', 'are', 'moments', 'anger', 'bit', 'hatred', 'Unfaithful', 'actually', 'very', 'romantic', 'touching', 'quality', 'very', 'evident', 'soundtrack', 'light', 'piano', 'accompanied', 'bit', 'strings', 'most', 'film', 'ending', 'scene', 'was', ""n't"", 'very', 'sharp', 'end', 'film', 'up', 'point', 'actually', 'surpirsed', 'good', 'way', 'enjoyed', 'seeing', 'acts', 'love', 'forgiveness', 'work', 'Unfaithful', 'lot', 'sexuality', 'not', 'kind', 'film', 'rather', 'deeper', 'meaning', 'play', 'here', 'performances', 'story', 'are', 'strong', 'enough', 'might', 'just', 'make', 'think', 'twice', 'cheating', 'maybe', 'recognize', 'better', 'parts', 'beautiful', 'marriage.Acting', '4.5Charcaters', '4Drama', '4.5Story', '4Overall', '4.5']",N/A

722300,A280GY5UVUS2QH,B00006RCNY,Doug Anderson,"[3, 3]","This thriller has that sense of events leading to an inevitable climax and ending because every aspect of this thriller is part of a formula we are all familiar with. And yet every aspect is also slightly better than your everyday thriller too. Diane Lane(Constance) especially although the famous scene on the train which is so talked about was not the scene I would isolate as proof of Diane Lanes talent and appeal as a first-rate actress. The train scene is noted for the array of emotions displayed by Constance(who is anything but constant)after she has had her first taste of unfaithfulness but the scene feels like several different emotional moments cut up and edited so that you get the impression that all these emotions are just flowing one after the other from the actress. I think one constant take would have been the more powerful way to convey this emotionally charged yet ambivalent and conflicted moment in her life. The scene fells like it could be taken out of any of Adrian Lynes films (9 1/2 weeks for instance). Not to say the movie isn't satisfying because it is but the other thing that feels like cheating is that Frenchman. He seems like a cut-out from a romance novel. It turns out he's not as perfect as Constance thought but the film loses what could possibly be another interesting dimension to the story by simply filling that role with a sex object--if he was more a real person and less a fantasy object Constance's emotions would also be more complex. As it is her emotions just alternate between two poles: sexual elation and marital guilt. In other words the film is great as Hollywood thrillers go but if you are an adventurous filmgoer who really has no patience for cliches I would recommend going back to the original French film by Claude Chabrol, La Femme Infidele. That film is a more interesting tale of bourgoisie ennui and a much more complex piece of filmmaking. Plus the original has one of the best endings I've ever seen, not the same ending as Unfaithful. Unfaithful gets five stars on the Hollywood thriller chart, but La Femme Infidele gets five stars on the much more discerning foreign film chart.",5,...Unfaithful....La Femme Infidele......,1052697600,"05 12, 2003",2003,2154,"['thriller', 'sense', 'events', 'leading', 'inevitable', 'climax', 'ending', 'aspect', 'thriller', 'part', 'formula', 'are', 'familiar', 'yet', 'aspect', 'also', 'slightly', 'better', 'everyday', 'thriller', 'too', 'Diane', 'Lane', 'Constance', 'especially', 'famous', 'scene', 'train', 'so', 'talked', 'was', 'not', 'scene', 'would', 'isolate', 'proof', 'Diane', 'Lanes', 'talent', 'appeal', 'first-rate', 'actress', 'train', 'scene', 'noted', 'array', 'emotions', 'displayed', 'Constance', 'who', 'anything', 'constant', 'had', 'first', 'taste', 'unfaithfulness', 'scene', 'feels', 'several', 'different', 'emotional', 'moments', 'cut', 'up', 'edited', 'so', 'get', 'impression', 'emotions', 'are', 'just', 'flowing', 'one', 'other', 'actress', 'think', 'one', 'constant', 'take', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'powerful', 'way', 'convey', 'emotionally', 'charged', 'yet', 'ambivalent', 'conflicted', 'moment', 'life', 'scene', 'fells', 'could', 'be', 'taken', 'Adrian', 'Lynes', 'films', '9', '1/2', 'weeks', 'instance', 'Not', 'say', 'movie', ""n't"", 'satisfying', 'other', 'thing', 'cheating', 'Frenchman', 'cut-out', 'romance', 'novel', 'out', 'not', 'as', 'perfect', 'Constance', 'thought', 'film', 'what', 'could', 'possibly', 'be', 'interesting', 'dimension', 'story', 'simply', 'filling', 'role', 'sex', 'object', 'was', 'more', 'real', 'person', 'less', 'fantasy', 'object', 'Constance', 'emotions', 'would', 'also', 'be', 'more', 'complex', 'emotions', 'just', 'alternate', 'two', 'poles', 'sexual', 'elation', 'marital', 'guilt', 'other', 'words', 'film', 'great', 'Hollywood', 'thrillers', 'go', 'are', 'adventurous', 'filmgoer', 'who', 'really', 'patience', 'cliches', 'would', 'recommend', 'going', 'back', 'original', 'French', 'film', 'Claude', 'Chabrol', 'La', 'Femme', 'Infidele', 'film', 'more', 'interesting', 'tale', 'bourgoisie', 'ennui', 'much', 'more', 'complex', 'piece', 'filmmaking', 'original', 'one', 'best', 'endings', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'not', 'same', 'ending', 'Unfaithful', 'Unfaithful', 'five', 'stars', 'Hollywood', 'thriller', 'chart', 'La', 'Femme', 'Infidele', 'five', 'stars', 'much', 'more', 'discerning', 'foreign', 'film', 'chart']",N/A
722301,A3BGLVC6OZM2JW,B00006RCNY,"douglas barton ""emotions in motion""","[5, 10]","As a general rule of thumb I rarely ever review films but after being subjected to Adrian Lyne's incredibly pompous and sordid offering "" Unfaithful "" I felt a critique was not only needed but somehow necessary. If nothing else to exercise some demons that I still feel when reminded of this montrosity.Where to begin!? Theres so much that is wrong with this movie that is difficult to know where to start. Lets begin with pretentions. If this movie is guilty of anything its simply that by disguising this tacky, sordid mess as a poor mans art-house film Mr. Lyne is equally guilty of attempting to dress up this blunder as a movie that tries far too hard to "" say something "" about the consequences of maritial infidelity. There is simply little to be found here that might even be considered remotely original or noteworthy. Diane Lane, portraying a housewife/fundraiser, who obviously has far too much time on her hands, literally runs into Oliver Martinez a young Frenchman ( major cliche! ) in Manhattan and begins a torrid affair with the young man. Its bad enough in this directors feeble attempts to portray our star as "" good person "" by casting her as someone who does charitable work i.e. thereby she, deep down, must be a really good person, No!? A move that seems truly contrived and desperate. Plus, since absurdities seem to abound, they make our young Romeo a book enthusiast...again a desperate attempt to portray this character as someone who isn't just a pretty face! Playing on the audiences sympathies there is actually a scene in which our misguided heroine sits in an empty subway car home and breaks-down after here first tryst with our young stud. In a feeble attempt to cast Ms. Lane as one who understands the seriousness of her mistake but one who nevertheless continues to fall victim to this same error in judgement time after time. And yes, while Ms. Lane's performance is noteworthy I seemed to be unable to gather little sympathy for her. No matter how hard the director may have tried to paint her  with a rather large dose of understanding! Its difficult to gather any empathy for a grown woman who seems to run strictly on emotion and has little intellectual skills at her disposal. Thereby awarding Diana all the emotional developement of a sixteen year high-school student! And to make this family truly complimant each other we have Richard Gere playing the clueless husband. An obvious good provider, all-around wonderful father and all that he seems truly miscast as an equally thick father figure.To take this brilliant mistake even further  Mr. Lyne awards his viewer with a couple of steamy sex-scenes in which our heroine and her young lover are shown in full nudity all the while making Whoppee while the audience is supposedly to buy into how truly passionate they really are and how Ms. Lane, apparently in need of a hobby, just needs to have her sexual desires fulfilled.And, in a relentless attempt to make Ms. Lane's character even more sympathetic, our young Frenchman turns out to be a cad! It seems as though our heroine cannot catch a break! Not that that prevents her from just one more sordid tryst with that two-timing Frenchman. Granted most Americans are easily 'titillated' but I suspect these episodes were thrown in, sadly, in an attempt to gather the film some badly needed notoriety. Although with all the talk of these ""hot and heavy' scenes it seems to have worked! It's all so obvious in its panderings and low-brow unoriginality!But it does get better. Obviously Mr. Lyne felt that a film about infidelity wasn't enough so at the half-way mark we have this movie doing a complete about-face and becoming a murder mystery! At this point I've thrown up my hands and wondered if I'd changed the channel unknowingly and am now watching a different movie! And yes, even then the movie simply falls apart even more so leaving the viewer with an ending that was far too ambiguous and self-serving for anyone to muster up any enthusiasm for. Overall an uncomprehensible mess that that never seemed to find its own direction and one in which relied far too heavily upon pathetic and contrived episodes that pandered to an audiences most basest instincts.

Roberts ""Hadrian12""","[1, 1]","Much like her role as an adulterous wife inA Walk on the Moon, the lovely Diane Lane once again plays an everyday housewife (Connie) who strays from her husband (Edward, played by Richard Gere) after being seduced by a dude with an accent.  {So that's what it takes to trump Richard Gere's GQ looks?  An accent?  Hmmmmmm}The reason why Lane is so absolutely perfect for this role as well as the similar role in MOON is pretty simple:  she is America's sweetheart.  It's precisely because she seems so decent & trustworthy (not to mention beautiful!) that she's ideal to play the destructive vixen.  Gosh, I don't even know Diane Lane, yet I'd trust her to babysit my nieces & nephews in a heartbeat as she appears so likeable!While adultery stories are fairly commonplace, the switching of gender roles is what makes this film intriguing.  Typically, it's the guy who cheats on the helpless wife (thinkFatal Attraction) that comprise this genre.  In this story, it's the wife who is naughty, and willing to risk everything for a few moments of bliss.Ultimately, the movie details much more than the story of a cheating wife & a cuckhold husband.  It serves as a glimpse of what can happen when adultery intersects with the law of unintended consequences.  Remember:  riding a Romantic rollercoaster can be a lot of fun - so long as the rollercoaster doesn't break down!If you're a fan of erotic thrillers, this one is a good add to your DVD collection.

722303,A18CA0GRHDVP8X,B00006RCNY,Earl Hazell,"[17, 19]","Diane Lane.As a professional actor and closet playwright, I spent much of this movie humbled by what has to be, if not THE greatest, one of the greatest displays of emotional and spiritual/artistic courage ever to be put on screen.  Diane Lane makes Anthony Hopkins' journey to find Hannibal Lecter within himself for THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS seem like a walk in the park.There are five movies that come to mind when I think of the subject of infidelity.  Before this, the other four were Bertolucci's BESEIGED with Thandie Newton, of course FATAL ATTRACTION, Spike Lee's message about race JUNGLE FEVER, and DAMAGE, with an incredible role by Jeremy Irons.  BESEIGED is a European art film that seeminlgy tastefully ends where the difficult questions infidelity brings to mind begin.  FATAL ATTRACTION seemed to be written by women who were too afraid of being in love with cheatin' heart men to make any art; under the surface it was almost too campy in its portrayal of the crazed lunatic woman as heart of moral parable--the price of Man's playin' out on Woman--to be taken seriously.  JUNGLE FEVER, as much as I love Spike when he's at the top of his game, went soft on us by making the messenger (sexuality as the basis of American racism) more important than the message (the fragility of the marriage relationship and the human soul).  And DAMAGE was like a more adult version of FATAL ATTRACTION, in that it seemed to be a study of an obsession that would have destroyed a marriage if lust never came to be what drove it, not lust, marriage or infidelity itself.UNFAITHFUL is a movie that needs to be seen for a person to understand how it towers above and achieves everything that the four I just mentioned tried to do (or should have).  The best double feature I could think of would be pairing this with AMERICAN BEAUTY; UNFAITHFUL could easily be seen as a sublime lesson in what the suburbs can do to the soul, and how it as such can be more dangerous to the soul than the ghetto's crime rate can be to the body and mind. *Boredom* seems to be the only motivating force leading to the eventual destruction of their entire lives in this movie--a woman's boredom.  And yet what makes this film so powerful (other than, again, the triple-Oscar winning performance of Diane Lane) is the fact that it is so well written and masterfuly directed--not to mention achieves ensemble with its supporting cast of men and women--that a clear cut motivation really does not exist.  Glen Close was just crazy; Michael Douglas was just selfish; Jeremy Irons was just strung up too tight and a profoundly manipulative woman snapped him; Wesley Snipes (according to Spike) just had to have some White-ness; Thandie Newton was heartbroken...everyone had a clear cut motivation for their actions (otherwise known as the megaphone for the director in question's ideas about life [or the marketplace]), except Diane Lane in UNFAITHFUL. And that is what will really disturb you to the point of needing to take a couple days out and digest the lesson on human nature you have been given by the time the credits role.If you are a Richard Gere fan, you will be surprised over the fact that, as good an actor as he is and can be, he triumphs in this movie almost purely by staying out of Dianel Lane's artistic way!  He deserves a *most generous supporting actor* Oscar.  My girlfriend's life was changed by what she saw in this movie (it deeply frightened and overwhelmed her); and I think mine was too.  If you are in love or married, see this movie at your own risk.

722304,AYG1U47VFZ165,B00006RCNY,"E. Lee Zimmerman ""Trekscribbler (aka Ed)""","[17, 24]","Adrian Lyne says that he likes his films to keep people talking about the nature of human relationships.I wonder if he meant that he likes to keep people yawning.A creative stretch for Lyne, UNFAITHFUL is a far more richly layered story than he's told in the past (think FATAL ATTRACTION mixed with PRESUMED INNOCENT).  Sadly, however, while he spends the first half of the film drawing us into this complex web of characters, he leaves the second act a predictable mess with no ending -- opting out of the true crisis in favor of rehashing his FATAL ATTRACTION ending with an uninspired twist.The real star of the film is Diane Lane.  Always beautiful, she rises to the occasion as Connie Sumner, a not-so-clear-work-or-stay-at-home-mom who has a job (something to do with raising money for charities through an auction) but seemingly no responsibilities to it.  She imbues Connie with a vulnerable passion while the script sorely lacks a motivation for her to face the risky prospects associated to being unfaithful.  An unlikely meeting between her and a young French book dealer (who, as well, seems to have no responsibilities to his said profession) meet, sparks ignite REALLY quickly, and they're in the sack before you can say, ""Can I offer you some tea?""Richard Gere plays her husband, the subdued Ed Sumner, who eventually learns of the affair.  His feelings of inadequacy in his marriage fuel him to hire a private investigator who rather quickly snaps some incriminating photos of Connie and the Frenchman.  Then, in perhaps the most unlikely turn of events, Ed decides to pay a visit and ... well, I'll leave something for those who are intent on seeing the film.Much of the critical praise has been directed at Lane, and there's no argument here.  However, a significant portion of the heaped praise has surrounded the sensuality that Lane brings to the role of Connie; while there is a deep undercurrent of unbridled passion, very little of it is truly seen on film.  Instead, Lyne takes his usual way out: close-ups of Lane's tortured expressions (which do work quite well); the glint of light reflecting off her porcelain body while taking a bath; and one bout of sex with dirty words thrown in for expediency.  The one true sensuous scene is Connie's first seduction: it's a cinema moment not easily forgotten.Worth the view for those who think sex is art, but UNFAITHFUL is certainly no date movie, as Lyne purports.  Were he faithful to the idea of keeping his central character (Connie) the centerpiece of the film, he might've succeeded in creating both.But, alas, even he is unfaithful.",1,Erotic Thriller ...

722305,A1JKFUUCZRA3Z4,B00006RCNY,Elisabeth,"[15, 22]","I've noticed that in t.v. and movies, female infidelity is treated much more lightly than male infidelity. If a man cheats, he's a scumbag, but if a woman cheats, she has a good reason to.  She was just lonely, bored, or angry at how unfairly her boyfriend/husband treated her.  Whatever the reason, it's excusable.For instance, on the show The Office, we're supposed to forgive Pam for having an emotional affair with Jim because her fianc&eacute; is such a jerk.In the movie Titanic, we're supposed to forgive Rose's emotional and sexual affair with Jack because her fianc&eacute; is a jerk, too.In a Perfect Murder, same thing except it's the husband who's a jerk.No one expects the emotional female to handle adult problems in a mature, adult way.This movie is no different.  Although her husband isn't a jerk, we're still supposed to be forgiving and understanding of her behavior because she was bored with her life.To help the audience better understand her ""pain"", there's also a bunch of symbolism thrown in, like:1 --- The wind forcing the wife and future lover to touch each other.This is basically the ""it just happened"" excuse that cheaters are famous for giving.  It's saying they didn't want this to happen.  The wind made them do it.  It just happened.2 --- The wife is struggling to cook two things at once and can't pay attention to either.This is supposed to symbolize how hard it is to juggle two lovers at once.  However, it didn't seem like the wife had any problems juggling two lovers.  Nor did she feel any remorse either.  After the first sexual encounter with her lover, she was practically giddy with excitement.  Even at the end, when she's having a farewell fantasy about him, she still thanks him for a good time.3 --- Their son wets his pants and she comforts him, saying we all have accidents.This is supposed to symbolize that affairs happen by accident.  We all make mistakes.  After all, no one's perfect.  But, first of all, you don't need to be perfect to stay faithful to someone.  There are plenty of imperfect people in the world who don't cheat.  And second, affairs are intentional violations, not innocent, accidental mistakes like involuntarily wetting your pants.  This is just the same wide-eyed innocent, but bogus, ""it just happened"" excuse all over again.4 --- The husband is so angry, he hits the lover over the head.This is supposed to symbolize how passion can make us do crazy things.  So can we really blame the wife's passion for making her do this crazy thing?5 --- The husband wants to leave with a dead body, but gets stuck in the elevator instead.This is supposed to symbolize how an affair can make you feel trapped and there's no way out.  But it's not like the wife's lover held her hostage.  It's not like he raped her.  This was something she volunteered to do...over and over again.  Also, she didn't act like a woman who felt trapped who wanted out.  She kept longing to see her lover again.6 --- The husband has a dead body in the trunk while his family is in the car, unsuspecting.This is supposed to symbolize how, when you have an affair, you have this dark secret that you have to pretend isn't there while you stay with your family.  Again, the wife seemed to manage this well.  And without remorse.Although these symbols are supposed to help me sympathize with her situation, I thought it was actually trying to excuse adultery instead.  And because these symbols were so transparent, they became corny reminders, too.If the point of the movie is for me to feel sorry for the wife, I didn't.  There's a scene where she leaves a voicemail on her lover's answering machine saying she wants to end the affair.  I guess I'm supposed to think, Awwwww, she really does love her husband.  Look, she's ending the affair, saying it's because she needs to devote more time to her family.But she only made that call AFTER she caught her lover with another woman.  Apparently, it was okay for HER to string along two guys at once...but for her lover to also string along two women at once?  Well, that's just wrong!So, I think the REAL reason she ended the affair was not because she loved her family so much, but because her ego was bruised.If she really loved her husband so much, she wouldn't be taking advantage of his trust in her and making a fool out of him for being so trusting.  There's even a scene where the husband discovers his wife gave her lover the gift the husband bought for her.  How cold-blooded is that?And if she loved her son so much, she wouldn't risk exposing him to adultery and tearing up his world like that.  In the movie, the son conveniently never finds out about his mom's true character, but in real life, kids do find out and some even lose respect for their parents when they do.I thought the ending wrapped up too nicely, too.  Although the husband does show some anger towards his wife, he mostly shows understanding of the affair and even allows her to grieve her lover in peace.  Now, it's one thing to be kind and sensitive to people, but it's another to lose yourself in the nice guy image and not stand up for your own principles.This is the same director who made Fatal Attraction, and just like in that movie, the solution to marital problems is to just get rid of the extra lover (violently if necessary) and everything will be okay.  But in real life, problems with infidelity don't resolve so smoothly.  It often leads to neverending trust issues (if the couple stays together), or a bitter divorce (if they don't).",1,Am I supposed to feel sorry for her?,1270080000,"04 1, 2010",2010,5525,"[""'ve"",

722306,A2KB14WCZ1DVE3,B00006RCNY,elvistcob@lvcm.com,"[3, 4]","I've been fascinated with Diane Lane for years now as a movie star.  She's made a career of  mostly being ""the girlfriend"" in a multitude of films, mostly consisting the males getting the real business of the film done around her.  Don't get me wrong.  Even with an astonishingly beautiful face, she was a strong character who held her own.  But even in one of her strongest roles in ""Lonesome Dove"", she still needs Robert Duvall to rescue her.  I wish she could have continued the role she created when they did ""Streets of Laredo"" to see how she could have handled the stronger role Sissy Spacek did very well.With ""Unfaithful"", she finally gets the role of her life.  She plays a woman who's marriage gets interrupted with the introduction of an affair.  Since the movie poster shows who practices the title adjective, it's not giving away anything to say it's her who's having the affair.And when the husband is ""American Gigolo"" himself,  Richard Gere, the object of the affair probably has to be pretty hunky himself.  This comes in the form of Olivier Martinez, who looks much like Richard Gere would today if here were 20 years younger, had an ethnic flair to him, and wore his hair and beard the way hunky guys do today.  Although they meet loosely due to his profession as a book dealer, and there is a brief attempt at a mental connection, this is a hot and heavy, no holds barred physical attraction from the get go.  This is one of the rare modern films that treats adult sexuality in a mature, adult manner, and for that I give the movie much praise.What makes the movie great is that Lane is not in a bad marriage at all.  Gere is, well, Richard Gere, but he's also a strong husband, and good provider who loves his wife very much.  So there is no beating husband to give her sympathy, and she's not even shopping for an affair.  It just crosses her path, and she falls for the hunk hook, line, and sinker.  So while it is shown that she wants the affair, and keeps coming back to him, you also see the guilt side build up in her.  This is essentially a good person who has a flaw.  We don't cheer for her, but we also don't necessarily hate her, either.  The performance deserves an Oscar nomination.The only problem is that something physically bad happens to one of the three.  I would have hoped to see how the affair could have been resolved other than by violent means,  which would have been a bigger challenge to the script.  But even this is redeemed, and how it has the remaining two character (I won't reveal which two) have to learn to adjust to the situation would give this one four and a half stars if I could.",4,Diane Lane finally gets her due,1044748800,"02 9, 2003",2003,2641,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'fascinated', 'Diane', 'Lane', 'years', 'now', 'movie', 'star', 'made', 'career', 'mostly', 'being', 'girlfriend', 'multitude', 'films', 'mostly', 'consisting', 'males', 'getting', 'real', 'business', 'film', 'done', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'Even', 'astonishingly', 'beautiful', 'face', 'was', 'strong', 'character', 'who', 'held', 'own', 'even', 'one', 'strongest', 'roles', 'Lonesome', 'Dove', 'still', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'rescue', 'wish', 'could', 'have', 'continued', 'role', 'created', 'when', 'did', 'Streets', 'Laredo', 'see', 'how', 'could', 'have', 'handled', 'stronger', 'role', 'Sissy', 'Spacek', 'did', 'very', 'well.With', 'Unfaithful', 'finally', 'role', 'life', 'woman', 'who', 'marriage', 'interrupted', 'introduction', 'affair', 'movie', 'poster', 'shows', 'who', 'practices', 'title', 'adjective', 'not', 'giving', 'away', 'anything', 'say', 'who', 'having', 'affair.And', 'when', 'husband', 'American', 'Gigolo', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'object', 'affair', 'probably', 'be', 'pretty', 'hunky', 'form', 'Olivier', 'Martinez', 'who', 'much', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'would', 'today', 'here', 'were', '20', 'years', 'younger', 'had', 'ethnic', 'flair', 'wore', 'hair', 'beard', 'way', 'hunky', 'guys', 'do', 'today', 'meet', 'loosely', 'due', 'profession', 'book', 'dealer', 'brief', 'attempt', 'mental', 'connection', 'hot', 'heavy', 'barred', 'physical', 'attraction', 'get', 'go', 'one', 'rare', 'modern', 'films', 'adult', 'sexuality', 'mature', 'adult', 'manner', 'give', 'movie', 'much', 'movie', 'great', 'Lane', 'not', 'bad', 'marriage', 'Gere', 'well', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'also', 'strong', 'husband', 'good', 'provider', 'who', 'wife', 'very', 'much', 'beating', 'husband', 'give', 'sympathy', 'not', 'even', 'shopping', 'affair', 'just', 'path', 'hunk', 'hook', 'line', 'sinker', 'So', 'shown', 'affair', 'coming', 'back', 'also', 'see', 'guilt', 'side', 'build', 'up', 'essentially', 'good', 'person', 'who', 'flaw', 'do', ""n't"", 'cheer', 'also', 'do', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'hate', 'either', 'performance', 'Oscar', 'nomination.The', 'only', 'problem', 'something', 'physically', 'bad', 'happens', 'one', 'three', 'would', 'have', 'hoped', 'see', 'how', 'affair', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'resolved', 'other', 'violent', 'means', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'bigger', 'challenge', 'script', 'even', 'redeemed', 'how', 'remaining', 'two', 'character', 'wo', ""n't"", 'reveal', 'two', 'have', 'learn', 'adjust', 'situation', 'would', 'give', 'one', 'four', 'half', 'stars', 'could']",N/A

However, I am now inclined to see more of Diane Lane in her other films, because even if others might disagree, Lane was the key in making this film viewable.Many filmmakers have tried desperatley to duplicate the succsess of the films Basic Instinct and Fatal Attraction.  Unconcsciouly or consciously, this film somehow takes off on that direction but the twist here is that it's the male who plays the part of the seducer, as opposed to the said films which play the female as the femme fatale.  Actually, the oldest story ever told to portray males as the seducers was relayed in the bedtime story Red Riding Hood.  Unfaithful may have taken on that theme.Olivier Martinez manages to deliver a decent portrayal of the book collector who presumably lives alone in New York City.  Diane Lane's character, the bored (presumably) New Jersey housewife, encounters his character and begins an unexpected affair.What interested me and what kept me watching this film is how Diane Lane's character tried to get out of the affair, and the last 30 minutes of the film will have you see Richard Gere's character blowing up Martinez's character into smithereens.  Those were the predictable moments, but you just want to see more and find out what actually IS going to happen to the married couple.The DVD itself has lots of treats.  If it weren't for the special features, I highly doubt that I would've purchased this DVD.  I loved the interviews with the cast.

Sure, it got a lot of hype for the steamy scenes, but I think it will get some nods around award time for Lane's performance.

Director Lyne has aptly selected a cinematographer, a score composer, and a script with as much space given to silence as to words to present a platform for three outstanding actors to take us on a journey through attraction, lust, betrayal, murder, and forgiveness. Diane Lane is incredibly fine in her stellar role as a woman who enters into an affair (with the sensitive and senusous Olivier Martinez) and manages to play out every aspect of this fantasy (both good and bad) in her body and facial language.

Like when the phone number falls out of the book the Frenchman gave her, and she kneals down to see what it is.  And when she realizes she pauses, and as she looks across the room, the dog is sitting on the easy chair, paws folded, looking at her.  Magestically, or like the devil.Or when she puts her quarter in the pay phone at the station, trying to decide whether to call him or not, and the first time she hangs up, the quarter drops into the change slot and as she takes it out, hesitating again, we see a close up of the quarter in her hand next to the change slot - above Washington's head, the words ""LIBERTY"".Devices such as these are constantly being used, sometimes very effectively.While dramatic, it is at the same time definitely a thriller.  There's that element of danger, and in ""Unfaithful"" it's coming out in spades in the form of her husband finding out.  The feeling of crime is palpable - as strong as would be for any robber breaking into a house at night.  The Frenchman, her lover, is rakish, impudent and good-looking, often putting her nerve-wrackingly in the way of danger. Richard Gere's performance as the husband delivers, and Diane Lane pretty much sizzles.  Their kid tends to grow on you, ""Don't be sad, Mom. Dad'll be home tomorrow.""

It's a first rate, by many reasons.The clever script and the golden direction of Lyne. In fact, when you see this film you know since the first fifteen minutes that you are in an unusual film. The narrative style, the accurate telling reminds us to Louis Malle (Damage), Joseph Losey (The messenger) amd Jacques Torneur (Detour).The superb performance of Diana Lane makes me think that this extraordinary talented and not less beuatiful actress (one of the top ten actually) has been neglected for many roles. She has an absolute charisma. She seduces the camera, and has multiple skills, for the drama and the light comedy (Under the sun of Toscane).I still remeber in Cotton Club and it's well known that Coppola has had the Midas touch for young actors. This is a high point for Lane. And remember she still was a teenager.Richard Gere is OK, but Olivier Martinez is outstanding. Happily he gets the perfect balance for Lane. His role is perversely made with a touch of refined style. Both of them steal the show.The film combines the best of the film noir with a deep load of internal anguish in this unhappy couple, for all we know.The shameless weighs all a world in the troubled soul of Gere after the fact, and so Lane is one step below the madness.The final ending is anthological.I've always shared the idea that in film like this, the ending must be opened.And Adrian Lyne crossed at last! the category of a worth director to become in a talented director of first rate.Hitchock told once that there were two kinds of directors; those who saw upon their heads and those who saw just the floor. It's a pedestrian but clear view that allows us classify them. And Lyne crossed the edge and went to the rank of creative directors.A vow for Lyne and we expect much more from you. Don't let us down. Don't look at behind. Remember Orson Welles when he was interwiewed in Cannes after his Othello in 1953.Welles said : Othello is a well done film. But the project that I've in mind.

722325,A1123L7ANYUTG0,B00006RCNY,Hugo 77,"[5, 6]","is based on Claude Chabrol's **La Femme Infidele**(1969). I am not familiar with the original, but I understand that Chabrol was  fond of Hitchcock and movies with murder and infidelity were a specialty of his, and the afore-mentioned picture was part of a trilogy of sorts dealing with infidelity ( including**Le Boucher**(1969) ),and all starring his then wife Stephanie Audran.When I saw **Unfaitful** I found myself wondering where the story was going, with its study of a youngish middle aged wife(Diane Lane)having an affair with a younger man. Something was missing, until somewhat past the middle of the film, when what was a rather understated character study of a woman having an affair that she was probably going to break off anyway became complicated by the husband(Richard Gere) finding out. Then, well past the half-way point of the film, the story shifted gears and became the melodrama that you somehow sensed director Adrian Lyne wanted to be making all along. The effect is a little jarring, as if two stories, temperamentally very different stories, had been sewn together, the woman's story, then the man's.Gere's husband's obsessiveness is frankly less interesting than Lane's affair, especially when we contrast Diane Lane's very rich and interesting performance with Gere's more routine one. I found myself wishing that the story was all told from the wife's point of view, especially since this would have created a sense of suspense, the wife wondering, ""what happened to the exotic French boyfriend, and why is my husband acting so funny?""",3,Unfaithful,1025568000,"07 2, 2002",2002,1566,"['based', 'Claude', 'Chabrol', '**La', 'Femme', 'Infidele**', '1969', 'am', 'not', 'familiar', 'original', 'understand', 'Chabrol', 'was', 'fond', 'Hitchcock', 'movies', 'murder', 'infidelity', 'were', 'specialty', 'afore-mentioned', 'picture', 'was', 'part', 'trilogy', 'sorts', 'dealing', 'infidelity', 'including**Le', 'Boucher**', '1969', 'starring', 'then', 'wife', 'Stephanie', 'Audran.When', 'saw', '**Unfaitful**', 'found', 'wondering', 'where', 'story', 'was', 'going', 'study', 'youngish', 'middle', 'aged', 'wife', 'Diane', 'Lane', 'having', 'affair', 'younger', 'man', 'Something', 'was', 'missing', 'somewhat', 'middle', 'film', 'when', 'what', 'was', 'rather', 'understated', 'character', 'study', 'woman', 'having', 'affair', 'was', 'probably', 'going', 'break', 'off', 'anyway', 'became', 'complicated', 'husband', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'finding', 'out', 'Then', 'well', 'half-way', 'point', 'film', 'story', 'shifted', 'gears', 'became', 'melodrama', 'somehow', 'sensed', 'director', 'Adrian', 'Lyne', 'wanted', 'be', 'making', 'along', 'effect', 'little', 'jarring', 'two', 'stories', 'temperamentally', 'very', 'different', 'stories', 'had', 'been', 'sewn', 'together', 'woman', 'story', 'then', ""man's.Gere"", 'husband', 'obsessiveness', 'frankly', 'less', 'interesting', 'Lane', 'affair', 'especially', 'when', 'contrast', 'Diane', 'Lane', 'very', 'rich', 'interesting', 'performance', 'Gere', 'more', 'routine', 'one', 'found', 'wishing', 'story', 'was', 'told', 'wife', 'point', 'view', 'especially', 'would', 'have', 'created', 'sense', 'suspense', 'wife', 'wondering', 'what', 'happened', 'exotic', 'French', 'boyfriend', 'why', 'husband', 'acting', 'so', 'funny']",N/A

So believable, yet so sympathetic. The emotions she displays in this movie make you believe that Diane/Connie is actually going through these extremely hard times. Diane lights up the screen in this film.I think this movie had a wonderful beginning. Hot and steamy. I don't think Olivier Martinez had enough lines or was in the film quite enough. I think this is finally an erotic film for women!! I just had a problem with the last part. The film did come to a climax and then you think, 'ok, now what?', then the film keeps going and going and then just ends! As though the entire theatre went, ""uhhh!"" But then we all left happy. The first part was so great and gets you going you forget about the ending. The director does get his point across very well with all of the emotions involved in having an affair. Diane Lane is fabulous.Only women who has had to make that split second decision to be faithful or not could possibly understand her dilemma. And once the wheels have been set in motion it is usually too late to go back. The scene where she wishes she had chosen the other path is heartbreaking and a wonderful moment in the film because by then their lives are forever changed and you find yourself wishing she had taken the other path. The movie belongs to Diane and Olivier. I do not think Richard Gere did a bad job. I just think that everyone is used to seeing him as the hunky object in every movie. This time he took a back seat. He played a normal husband.  He didn't play a boring old man, just a normal husband. Olivier Martinez and Diane Lane have really shown their talents on this film.As one character pointed out, affairs always end badly and/or tragically. The now dysfunctional married couple of Richard Gere and Diane Lane try pitifully to survive and overcome a MAJOR stumbling block and get back to their previous nuptial bliss but the whole mess DID end badly and tragically.

Unfaithful tries very hard to be what Fatal Attraction was and fails because of its ending. What was director Adrian Lyne trying to tell us with that ending? All cops are inept when it comes to TRULY investigating a crime? After the murder, all the characters and their development throughout the film fell apart. It was like watching an entirely different movie with characters you did not recognize, yet you've already spent well over an hour getting to know them. Talk about an alienating experience. Now, if this were the intention then Bravo - but NO WAY was this Lyne's intention. It was too bumbling and rushed to be intentional. Again the police officer's who investigate the murder give perhaps the worst portrayal of police work in motion picture history. No follow through, no presence of suspicion, just questions and a lot of backroom talk/accusations between Lane's and Gere's characters. So there we have Unfaithful - a film that built quite a story only to dump it in the last half hour for an ending that never was going to fit the story Lyne was trying to tell.

722337,A3TZB9SXJCFMFJ,B00006RCNY,J. Michael Click,"[3, 5]","In Adrian Lyne's ""Unfaithful"", Diane Lane is finally given a role worthy of her considerable talents ... and proceeds to play it flawlessly.  Cast as a housewife and mother in her mid-thirties who stumbles (literally) into an affair with a much younger man, Lane never strikes a false note as her character ricochets between feelings of uncertainty, exhuberance, pleasure, intense eroticism, then finally guilt, shame, despair and fear.  It's a remarkable, career-crowning performance in which the actress uses her entire being as an instrument.  Her mellifluous voice is pitched just a notch below normal, lending a delicate rawness to her character's words; her body communicates volumes as it shivers with sexual anticipation or recoils with self-reproach; her delicate face is a mirror reflecting an unending stream of volatile and often conflicting emotions.  It's taken 23 years for Lane's talent to fulfill the promise she demonstrated as a teenager in 1979's ""A Little Romance"", but unquestionably, this performance was well worth the wait.Happily, the film is not just a one-woman show.  As Lane's cuckolded husband, Richard Gere plays against type with a quiet intensity and growing sense of desperation that finally erupts in one of the best scenes he's ever committed to film.  His is a beautifully restrained, deeply felt performance that complements Lane's work perfectly.  Despite the fact that these two characters are deeply flawed, the actors make them intriguingly sympathetic and undeniably fascinating.  Olivier Martinez offers strong support as Lane's lover, and Chad Lowe also scores in his brief scenes as one of Gere's friends and employees.On the technical side, the film is expertly edited (especially note the sequence in which Lane rides the train home while remembering the events of the afternoon; and the one in which Lane and Gere both dress while in different cities), and the musical score is both lush and haunting.  Film buffs will note several clever homages to Lyne's ""Fatal Attraction"" (a butcher knife on a counter; drama in an elevator; a woman driving recklessly while in emotional crisis; a man slipping into a secured residential building, etc.).In addition to a superb video and sound transfer, the DVD offers a wealth of fascinating extras: the Original Theatrical Trailer;a documentary on the making of the movie; an excerpt from Charlie Rose's television interview with Lyne, Lane, and Gere; the director's script notes; individual interviews with the three top-billed actors and the film's editor; trailers for two of Fox's 2003 releases; deleted scenes (including an alternate ending); and more!

Remade from the French film and morality play ""La Femme infidel"" (aka, ""The Unfaithful Wife""); as directed by Claude Chabrol in 1968.

Much reviewed, there isn't much more for me to say. My most memorable recollection, however,  is the excellent counterpoint scene when Lane rides home to Connecticut after the first passionate encounter with her French ""hunk"" lover.

The guy seems subliterate--he has a roomful of volumes, but seems to know one poem, and he uses it for seduction purposes.But this is one of those movies where you can enjoy it if you can set aside your response to these kinds of cliches and illogical actions on the part of each character.  What makes this film somewhat worthwhile is the emotive, nonverbal acting job done by the stars, especially Diane Lane, who is incredibly vivid in taking you through her range of feelings as the affair begins to take hold in her mind.

They live in a perfect house in an affluent New York City suburb and have a child, a well behaved son, enrolled in the perfect school. Edward is financially successful as the head of his own business, and is apparently an excellent provider. Connie doesn't have to work, but spends her time soliciting for charities. They have bountiful food on the table and drive upscale, late model cars. All are physically healthy. The household is free of disruptive emotional extremes.Some would kill for much less.One day in the Big Apple, a violent windstorm literally blows Connie into the arms of a used-book merchant, Paul Martel (Olivier Martinez), staggering down the street with a burden of tomes. Both fall to the pavement, Connie scraping her knee. Paul is young and handsome. Paul invites Connie up to his apartment for tea and band aids. Such is Connie's starvation for seduction and passionate intimacy that she's soon visiting the city on a regular basis for a discrete affair carried on not always so discretely. Edward becomes suspicious after odd answers to the usual end-of-the-day query, ""What did you do today, honey?"" Edward eventually hires a gumshoe to follow her.I first saw Diane Lane in the TV miniseries LONESOME DOVE and thought ""What a sweetheart!"" In UNFAITHFUL, it's ""What a Babe!"" - but, hey, let's not allow that to color my opinion of her performance here. Lane is superb as a subliminally bored woman feeling the conflicting emotions - giddiness, guilt, exuberance, mortification - of an illicit affair, a turmoil wonderfully illustrated as we watch her face and body language as she comes home on the commuter rail after her first intimate encounter. Lane, not Gere, is the star of this film, though the latter is perfectly adequate as the man who slowly realizes he's being cuckolded. My minor disenchantment with the movie is an ending too open-ended for my taste, especially as it occurs in front of the local police station.Though the viewer must certainly think that Connie is making a Big Mistake for the long term, I had sympathy for her short term actions. I'm left wondering if this is a gender-based opinion. Would I have felt different if the roles of Ed and Connie had been reversed, and the former had been doing the cheating? I suspect so. And would a female viewer have a harsher opinion of Connie's choices?I liked UNFAITHFUL for the questions it raises. I think it much better than the response it received while in theater release.

722344,AD9WTAOAFUZA4,B00006RCNY,"Jose R. Perez ""Jose""","[3, 3]","""Unfaithful"", Adrian Lyne's searing film, explores the realities and consequences of an extramarital affair from several points of view.  Diane Lane gives a phenomenal, pheremone-inducing performance as Connie - suburban mother of one and faithful wife to Richard Gere - as she falls into a steamy fulfilling fantasy with Olivier Martinez (perhaps the sexiest Frenchman ever caputred on screen.)  The emotional and orgasmic highs Connie thills to are juxtaposed against Gere's growing suspicions and eventual downfall.  Without giving too much away, suffice it to say the film in many ways mirrors the director's own ""Fatal Attraction"" without the rabbit stew, and told from an adulteress' perspective.  Against a suburban backdrop - from riverside train depots to school plays - the drama is wrenching as we, the audience are forced to consider our own intentions and fears.Lane simply glows on screen -- her face speaks volumes whether in the throes of ecstasy, the restlessness of lying or the anguish of guilt.  All are exposed on her wonderful face, her beauty tainted by scabs yet real and fresh on her wounded knees.  This is a woman struggling with her personal truth, and as the story progresses, she becomes both victor and victim, and Lane embodies both intelligence and grace.  Surely, this is an Oscar-worthy performance.Gere fares equally well in a surprising role as a conflicted husband and father, while Martinez simply oozes enough sexual electricity to light up a Times Square billboard.  This is a star making performance for Martinez, one that should put him on the radar screen for idol-starved young women who love the movies.  Gere is handsome as ever - at first our inclination is to recoil from Connie's risky choices (seriously - what woman would ever kick Richard Gere out of bed?) -- but Martinez weaves a spell on us as on Connie and we are able to appreciate the blunt sexual forces that overtake her.  Diane Lane's unforgettable performance will remind you of how human we all are, and how painful being human can sometimes be.""Unfaithful"" doesn't break too much new ground for the director, who's covered similar themes though never quite this well.  Untimately, it's a well told story with superbly nuanced performances.  A final word of advice --- couples who watch it together should be prepared to confront demons, discuss the obvious themes it poses, or profess unerring monogamy.

Both Diane Lane and Richard Gere render remarkable performances in their turns as husband and wife.  In fact it was this movie that made me a fan of Richard Gere.  This movie is full of lust, sex, raw passion and, of course, betrayal.  Pampered housewife meets sexy French book dealer.  Their affairs leads to tragedy.Diane Lane is absolutely gorgeous.  I have always thought so.  She is killer in this role and I was glad when she received an Oscar nomination for her portrayal of the lusting housewife.  Her character engages in a torrid affair with a book dealer whom she literally runs into one day.  At first she throws herself into the affair but eventually guilt pays her a visit.  Unfortunately guilt comes too late.The husband, suspecting his wife is being unfaithful, has his wife followed.  He then confronts his wife's lover.  At first the meeting is calm, although the viewer can sense there is a sick morbidity underlying it.  The first time I watched this movie I was unprepared for the scene with the snow globe.  It was so unexpected and sickened me so much that I literally fainted.  It is after this scene that the movie turns to slow decay (not of quality of film but of lives unraveling).  The heaviness of death at first lingers and then becomes pervasive as husband and wife slowly confront the reality of their situation and begin to accept the consequences of their actions.It is a sad, tragic movie in the end.  Some reviewers have compared it to Fatal Attraction although I don't see the comparison at all.  At the end of this movie, everyone involved loses.  There is a strong moral to this story.  The film is in no way preachy.

This weekend it was on the TNT channel so I tuned in.  First let me say that the previews were much better than the movie itself. I don't know if it's because it was the t.v. version, but I found this movie to be totally lacking.First of all, I have no idea what job the wife in the movie had that let her get all dressed up and go into the city every single day.  Her husband kept mentioning something about ""fund raising"" but I never quite got what she actually did. Secondly, the day she met the book-guy I have never, ever seen wind like that except in a hurricane.  Thirdly, any woman who finds herself in a strange neighborhood (which obviously she was in by the way she kept looking around confused), would most definitely NOT go up to some strangers apartment for a band-aid even when he said that he was ""not an axe murderer"".Now for the spoiler. . .I can understand why the husband was upset when he met the ""other man"", and why he would have gone to see him. What I don't get is this:  Why did he suddenly get all sweaty and feel sick? He kept saying ""I don't feel well. I'm sick"" and you can see the sweat pouring down his face and meanwhile his vision was all blurry and tilty. Was his drink drugged or were we supposed to assume that he was in a ""red rage"" after finding the snow globe he gave his wife, who turned around and gave to this guy? Also, killing him with the snow globe? COME ON!!!The bitter irony after the bludgeoning is the wife calling book-guy and leaving a message that it's over.And now we get into the desposing of the body. . . Richard Gere wraps the guy in a sheet, then in a rug and duct tapes in together.  He then has to drag the body-shaped shroud down the stairs to the car because the elevator is broken. A guy out there sees him struggling and asks ""Can I help you with that"" never once questioning the body-shaped, duct-taped wrapped shroud.  HELLO?!?  And then, later that night he gets rear-ended in a parking lot -- in a parking space for that matter which I can't quite figure out how that happens -- and he can't quite shut the trunk and gets snippy with the guy who hit him when he asks if he could help him close it.  Okay, raise your hand if you'd be suspicious about this.  That's what I thought!Finally, we come to the incompetent police people.  This is where I think the movie probably could have gone on and maybe gotten better, but it didn't. The police come and talk to the wife and husband because they found her name on a piece of paper in the book-guys apartment. She lies and he dove-tails off that lie (very poorly I might add) to make it seem like they met him at some event.  You don't have to be in law enforcement to be able to spot the lies they spewed.

The main cast of characters comprise of Richard Gere (Edward Sumner), Diane Lane (Constance 'Connie' Sumner) and Olivier Martinez (Paul Martel). This is your basic story about an out of it husband who works all of the time, a bored housewife and a good looking french guy to rescue her. Well maybe not the basic story. I enjoyed watching this movie. I actually saw it on HBO first and liked it enough to buy it so I have watched it about 5 or 6 times since then. Connie meets up with Olivier in SOHO where she is buying toys for her son's birthday. Its stormy, the wind ends up blowing her down and she skins her knee. This is where the french man comes in. Olivier has a sort of hot, geeky kind of look. He isn't hunky, but he draws you in with his mannerisms. He is the medium heighth, dark and handsome type. Connie is immediately attracted to Olivier, as was I, and so the story begins. If you love hot, steamy sex scenes that are made for the big screen this is the movie for you. Connie and Olivier have sex almost everywhere. This is the problem though, Connie is starting to act differently and her husband begins to notice. He hires a P.I. to follow her. Bingo she is cheating on him. Edward confronts Olivier only seconds after Olivier and Connie had sex outside of his apartment in the hallway. Anyway Edward ends up killing Olivier with one of those snowballs that Connie had given to Olivier that was actually one that Edward had given to Connie. Well this is where I lost interest in the movie. Olivier, the hot french man is out of the picture. The remainder of the film is about trying to figure out who killed Olivier. The first 3/4 of this movie are great. The end portion boring. I suggest renting this movie and finding out for yourself before purchasing it.

Even so, it is still well worth seeing, for so many reasons... Diane Lane, for one, shown here as a middle-aged wife who falls into an affair with a much younger man, ignoring her best impulses, the ones that tell her this is a mistake. Newcomer Olivier Martinez is another plus in this film...he has a sizzling eroticism that jumps off the screen and he plays it to the hilt, making Connie's betrayal of her marriage and her conventional life truly believable- only the strongest female viewer will be able to watch the scenes of them together without a quickening pulse (or more).To director Lyne's credit, he shows how infidelity inevitably colors and poisons a marriage, creeping into the tiniest aspects of life, forcing guilty looks, lies and nervousness at even the most innocent or unexpected times. Richard Gere, playing Connie's husband, Edward, is superb at showing a man who knows his wife so well that he practially smells the deceit in the air before she walks in the door.The flaws? Martinez is a bit of a stereotype, seemingly charming at first, then showing darker, more unpleasant sides. Perhaps the movie would have benefited from a more complex person, unlike the rather callow person he reveals himself to be. Also, I thought it odd that Connie ran into family acquaintances while with him, even though the odds were against this...and then an employee from Edward's company happens to see them as well.

Chabrol has made forty some films such as Le Beau Serge (1958), Les Biches (1968), Le Boucher (1970), and recently Flower of Evil (2003). In 1969 Chabrol wrote and directed Le Femme Infid&egrave;le, which is the root for the remake Unfaithful by Adrian Lyne.  It was just a question of time until someone would remake one of Chabrol's films.  Lyne seems to be the perfect match for this as he also has a past of mysterious and suspenseful films such as Fatal Attraction (1987) and Jacobs Ladder (1990).Unfaithful begins with displaying the chaotic life of the housewife Connie (Diane Lane) as her job is to provide a good home for her husband, Ed (Richard Gere), and their son.  Amidst the daily chores Connie is also heavily involved in fundraising and antiquities while the son is at school and the Ed is at his security firm.  This chaotic lifestyle which seems to be in a rut as everyday occurs in a similar fashion.  However, a fresh wind blows Connie's way when she bumps into the young book dealer Martel (Olivier Martinez).  Martel lives in an old apartment that is overcrowded with books, and Connie is devoured by Martel's charismatic and well-read mind.Ed is a loving and faithful husband with a mountain of trust for his wife.  However, Connie begins to act strange in minute manners and the small things that she does bewilder Ed.  This perplexed mental state of Ed leads him to further express his love for Connie as he believes that he is wrong, but to his shocking revelation she does not return it.  The unanswered love leads Ed to hire a good friend and private detective to find out the truth.  The truth leads Ed to a strong internal pain.  A pain that is so strong that it hinders clear thoughts and actions, which leads to a bloody event.Lyne does a marvelous job directing the film as it provides similar suspense that the audience will receive from Chabrol's films.  Diane Lane performs brilliantly; a performance that nominated her for several cinematic awards for her part.

Connie (Lane) and Edward (Gere) are successful suburbanites with a seemingly happy marriage, until Connie meets an attractive younger man and begins an affair.  Edward wonders what's going on, hires a private detective, and gets the answer he suspected all along.Lane is memorable as the guilt-ridden wife who is obsessed with her lover.  She is lovely, mature, and honest in her portrayal and deserved her nomination for Best Actress.  Gere is almost a supporting actor here, but he is wonderful playing an average guy.  Olivier Martinez plays Lane's paramour.  His character was fairly one-dimensional and could have been developed further, but he was very good in the role.The first time I saw the movie, I thought it was relatively dull because of its relentlessly low-key presentation and leisurely pace.  On the second viewing, however, I found it a real winner.  There are long periods without dialogue, where the camera focuses on facial nuances.

Kate Burton's (Tracy) haunting lines to her girlfriends that it is/was the one thing in her life that she wishes she had never done, is delivered in chilling sentences and with a prescience only born of painful experience.Diane Lane, lovely as always, reaches the rare ""best scene I ever saw"" in the movie reserved for Thomas More's post sentencing speech, Henry at Agincourt and Rocky's 1st round left hook. It is the scene where she returns from her first sexual dalliance with Oliver Martinez (Paul Martel) and in 60 seconds on the rocking train out of Grand Central without uttering a word she conveys self loathing, joy, rage at herself, sexual arousal, tears of shame, and humor. Not a word is spoken. It is what separates Lane (Connie) from the rest of the pack and makes her a true artist, so much more than a pretty face, an actor about which you would say ""I want to see THAT movie just because she's in it.""Richard Gere (Edward) is an actor who knows his place. He is not the center of attention and seemingly is willing to be a supporting actor, and do everything within his consumate skill to make her role even better.This movie is not terribly distant from Adrian Lynne's ""Fatal Attraction,"" with the exception of the marvelous photography and the juxtapostioning of scenes with (if there can be) powerful subtlety. There is one scene in the last third of the movie in a lonely site with the wind blowing the trash of human detritus around, and the camera tilts at a familiar angle to remind us of the trash blowing around Connie's head moments before she meets Paul Martel (Martinez) in the beginning of the movie. The positioning is brilliant.The love affair is creepy, scary and erotic; Edward's suspicion, disbelief, confusion and rage well played; Connie's addiction to the relationship perfect; photography superb. Here's what I felt were the parts that I as the viewer did not find credible.You have to believe in your characters. It's not that they won't do something unpredictable. It's when they do something unpredictable, in the larger context of the film it makes sense. Connie is a happy ""I have everything"" housewife. Her husband worships her, loves her physically as well as emotionally, dotes on her, comes home and asks her about her. The boy is a good son, seems to have all the accessories of young sonmanship with no problems. She is beautiful and full of joie vivre!. So in seedy Soho, carrying bags of party favors on a windy morning, sober, she agrees to walk into an apartment owned by a ruffian, slimy, sexy looking man, all with his caveat ""I am not a serial killer.""Connie. Are you insane? Forget about the affair. IT'S NEW YORK CITY! Mark Chapman. David Berkowitz. Are you nuts?OK. I found that to be ridiculous. Ditto, the affair. Most of us are aware . . . especially those that have worked hard to be where they end up, in Riverdale, beautiful cars, beautiful partners, that we don't do certain things. Drugs. Driving intoxicated. Bungee jumping in Tanzania. So why is she having an affair? At least Dan (Michael Douglas in Fatal Atraction) was a little bit over the top with Alex (Glenn Close), and in fact seemed kind of slimy himself. But Connie is so nice that other women like her! She shows no sign of any problem on the homefront. Sure people have affairs for a variety of reasons but that's just it. There are reasons. There are none here. It was/is incredible.Diane Lane is great; Gere is extremely good; photography is brilliant; great, provocative, ambiguous ending. Really should be 4 1/2 stars.

722366,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00006RCNY,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[5, 6]","For me ""Unfaithful"" presented some interesting considerations simply on the basis of the casting of the principle actors in the Sumner family.  This is Diane Lane, whom I had a big time crush on when her first film ""A Little Romance"" came out in 1979, as the wife; Richard Gere, the sexy star of ""American Gigolo"" and ""Pretty Woman,"" as the husband; and Erik Per Sullivan, Dewey on ""Malcolm in the Middle,"" as the child.  Consequently, ""Unfaithful"" tells the story of a wife who has a steamy affair, played by the only child star I ever had a crush on, who thereby cheats on her husband, one of the sexiest stars in the movies, while their child, one of the cutest and funniest little kids ever to be on television, watches and wonders what is going on.In all these personal ruminations the Gere movie persona actually plays into the effectiveness of the film, because we are never really sure why Connie Sumner has an affair.  More to the point, we are not sure why she, or any woman, would cheat on Richard Gere (Edmund Sumner).  The film's suggestion is that Connie is caught up in strong natural forces, symbolized by the extremely strong winds that literally blow her into the arms of another man, Paul Martel (Olivier Martinez).  But ultimately what is important here are not the causes, but the results as both straying wife and desperate husband go too far.""Unfaithful"" is based on Claude Chabrol's film ""La Femme Infidele,"" and ""based"" is indeed the operative world (although the story goes back in great literature to ""Madame Bovary"").  Although I have not seen the original, it is clear from the director's commentary and other mentions of the French film that there are significant differences between the two, both in terms of what is shown regarding the affair (more) and where the story ends (later).  The strength of Adrian Lyne's film is that it eschews conventionality, both in terms of how it presents the affair and how it plays out the consequences of the actions of these characters.This film is one of the most erotic I have seen in some times.  The eroticism is based on Lane's performance (specifically the look she gets in her eye), but I also think her age enters into it because her maturity brings a realism to these scenes that transcends the normal sexual romping we see in so many of these films.  Lyne's direction (and Anne V. Coates's editing) also comes into play as the first sex scene is a montage of Connie on the train ride home with flashbacks of what she is remembering.  The net effect is more suggestive than explicit, but that is, of course, what makes it particularly erotic.I also liked the way Lyne ends the film (even more so after seeing the alternative ending).  As the plot develops and takes its twists and turns you can see all the generic possibilities spreading out before you, but Lyne chooses none of those paths.  Consequently, ""Unfaithful"" ends as I found myself wanting it to end, although certainly that was not what I was thinking would end up happening half way through the film.Final Note: The DVD extras in terms of commentary and interviews are extremely helpful in providing insights into the way the film developed.  Lyne, Lane and Gere were clearly into this production and hopefully Lane will at least receive an Oscar nomination for her performance.",5,Diane Lane all grown up and in search of a little adultery,1043280000,"01 23, 2003",2003,3320,"['Unfaithful', 'presented', 'interesting', 'considerations', 'simply', 'basis', 'casting', 'principle', 'actors', 'Sumner', 'family', 'Diane', 'Lane', 'whom', 'had', 'big', 'time', 'crush', 'when', 'first', 'film', 'Little', 'Romance', 'came', 'out', '1979', 'wife', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'sexy', 'star', 'American', 'Gigolo', 'Pretty', 'Woman', 'husband', 'Erik', 'Per', 'Sullivan', 'Dewey', 'Malcolm', 'Middle', 'child', 'Consequently', 'Unfaithful', 'story', 'wife', 'who', 'steamy', 'affair', 'played', 'only', 'child', 'star', 'ever', 'had', 'crush', 'who', 'thereby', 'cheats', 'husband', 'one', 'sexiest', 'stars', 'movies', 'child', 'one', 'cutest', 'funniest', 'little', 'kids', 'ever', 'be', 'television', 'watches', 'wonders', 'what', 'going', 'personal', 'ruminations', 'Gere', 'movie', 'persona', 'actually', 'effectiveness', 'film', 'are', 'never', 'really', 'sure', 'why', 'Connie', 'Sumner', 'affair', 'More', 'point', 'are', 'not', 'sure', 'why', 'woman', 'would', 'cheat', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'Edmund', 'Sumner', 'film', 'suggestion', 'Connie', 'caught', 'up', 'strong', 'natural', 'forces', 'symbolized', 'extremely', 'strong', 'winds', 'literally', 'blow', 'arms', 'man', 'Paul', 'Martel', 'Olivier', 'Martinez', 'ultimately', 'what', 'important', 'here', 'are', 'not', 'causes', 'results', 'straying', 'wife', 'desperate', 'husband', 'go', 'too', 'far', 'Unfaithful', 'based', 'Claude', 'Chabrol', 'film', 'La', 'Femme', 'Infidele', 'based', 'indeed', 'operative', 'world', 'story', 'back', 'great', 'literature', 'Madame', 'Bovary', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'original', 'clear', 'director', 'commentary', 'other', 'mentions', 'French', 'film', 'are', 'significant', 'differences', 'two', 'terms', 'what', 'shown', 'regarding', 'affair', 'more', 'where', 'story', 'later', 'strength', 'Adrian', 'Lyne', 'film', 'conventionality', 'terms', 'how', 'affair', 'how', 'out', 'consequences', 'actions', 'characters.This', 'film', 'one', 'most', 'erotic', 'have', 'seen', 'times', 'eroticism', 'based', 'Lane', 'performance', 'specifically', 'look', 'eye', 'also', 'think', 'age', 'enters', 'maturity', 'realism', 'scenes', 'normal', 'sexual', 'romping', 'see', 'so', 'many', 'films', 'Lyne', 'direction', 'Anne', 'V.', 'Coates', 'editing', 'also', 'play', 'first', 'sex', 'scene', 'montage', 'Connie', 'train', 'ride', 'home', 'flashbacks', 'what', 'remembering', 'net', 'effect', 'more', 'suggestive', 'explicit', 'course', 'what', 'particularly', 'also', 'liked', 'way', 'Lyne', 'film', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'seeing', 'alternative', 'ending', 'plot', 'twists', 'can', 'see', 'generic', 'possibilities', 'spreading', 'out', 'Lyne', 'none', 'paths', 'Consequently', 'Unfaithful', 'found', 'wanting', 'end', 'certainly', 'was', 'not', 'what', 'was', 'thinking', 'would', 'end', 'up', 'happening', 'half', 'way', 'film.Final', 'Note', 'DVD', 'extras', 'terms', 'commentary', 'interviews', 'are', 'extremely', 'helpful', 'providing', 'insights', 'way', 'film', 'developed', 'Lyne', 'Lane', 'Gere', 'were', 'clearly', 'production', 'hopefully', 'Lane', 'will', 'least', 'receive', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'performance']",N/A

The ""American Gigolo"" star, who hasn't aged at all, just grayed a bit, is the cuckolded husband. It seems impossible to accept that this woman who fills her days with fund-raising and facials would need to stray from a man rich enough to buy a national monument-sized house to live in.There is no reason ever supplied why Lane connects with Martinez. Yes, he is sexy; yes, he is smoldering. He speaks with a French accent, likes jazz music, but he also comes across as an arrogant, untrustworthy sleaze. If Lane had been bedding down with Danny Devito for the past 15 years, perhaps I could understand her headlong rush into bed with Martinez. But, please, she's been making whoopee with Richard Gere.Improbable and cliche-ridden, ""Unfaithful"" offers nothing to sink one's teeth into. Olivier Martinez as the ""younger man"" is supposed to be an expert in vintage books. It's quite laughable since he doesn't look as if he can even read a complete sentence in English.The repercussions of Lane's infidelity are exaggerated and preposterous. As an actress, Lane does portray facially the guilt, the sudden rush, the depression, and the exhilaration of cheating. However, I believe it's her impressive physique and willingness to go nude that will stay in most watchers' minds.Not a good movie, not a sexy movie, not a movie worth a second viewing.

722371,A3SKGQSU29ZV80,B00006RCNY,Lleu Christopher,"[3, 4]","This was based on a 1969 French film and director Adrian Lyn maintains a European flavor in many ways. The slow pace, studied performances and visual style of Unfaithful are not often seen in mainstream American movies. Diane Lane is superb as Connie, a mostly content but slightly bored housewife. Richard Gere is also faultless as her corporate-type husband Edward. It is actually one of his best performances, ranging from understated to appropriately emotional. The couple live a comfortable life in an upper middle class Westchester home with their son. It's a suburb where almost everyone commutes to New York City by train. On one excursion into the city, Connie runs into a young Frenchman named Paul (Oliver Martinez). This scene is dominated by a violent wind that knocks Connie, both literally and figuratively, off her feet. This unlikely meeting is portrayed as almost mystically romantic, belying the all-too real events that follow. Connie falls and cuts herself and Paul invites her up to his apartment. The contrast between Connie's ordinary life and the bohemianism of Paul's existence (he has a huge loft filled with old books) is stark indeed.  Martinez does a good job of turning a stereotype character (the suave, unshaven, amorous Frenchman) into a real person. They drift into a passionate affair that becomes an obsession for Connie. Edward soon suspects something and takes measures to find out what is going on. From this point, the plot is admirably restrained and does not fall into some typical movie scenarios. On the other hand, there are some very contrived things in the script. Several times people meet or see each other --in the middle of Manhattan-- at just the right (or wrong) time. The most pivotal incident in the film ends in a rather fluky manner. What is frustrating is that all of the contrivances could have been taken out or changed without interfering with the story. Still, the cast is good enough and the plot original and subtle enough to make this a memorable and compelling film.",4,"Great performances, engrossing, sometimes contrived",1040601600,"12 23, 2002",2002,2033,"['was', 'based', '1969', 'French', 'film', 'director', 'Adrian', 'Lyn', 'European', 'flavor', 'many', 'ways', 'slow', 'pace', 'studied', 'performances', 'visual', 'style', 'Unfaithful', 'are', 'not', 'often', 'seen', 'mainstream', 'American', 'movies', 'Diane', 'Lane', 'superb', 'Connie', 'mostly', 'content', 'slightly', 'bored', 'housewife', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'also', 'faultless', 'corporate-type', 'husband', 'Edward', 'actually', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'ranging', 'understated', 'appropriately', 'emotional', 'couple', 'live', 'comfortable', 'life', 'upper', 'middle', 'class', 'Westchester', 'home', 'son', 'suburb', 'where', 'almost', 'everyone', 'commutes', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'train', 'one', 'excursion', 'city', 'Connie', 'young', 'Frenchman', 'named', 'Paul', 'Oliver', 'Martinez', 'scene', 'dominated', 'violent', 'wind', 'Connie', 'literally', 'figuratively', 'off', 'feet', 'unlikely', 'meeting', 'portrayed', 'almost', 'mystically', 'romantic', 'belying', 'all-too', 'real', 'events', 'follow', 'Connie', 'Paul', 'up', 'apartment', 'contrast', 'Connie', 'ordinary', 'life', 'bohemianism', 'Paul', 'existence', 'huge', 'loft', 'filled', 'old', 'books', 'stark', 'indeed', 'Martinez', 'good', 'job', 'turning', 'stereotype', 'character', 'suave', 'unshaven', 'amorous', 'Frenchman', 'real', 'person', 'drift', 'passionate', 'affair', 'obsession', 'Connie', 'Edward', 'soon', 'something', 'measures', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'going', 'point', 'plot', 'admirably', 'restrained', 'not', 'fall', 'typical', 'movie', 'scenarios', 'other', 'hand', 'are', 'very', 'contrived', 'things', 'script', 'Several', 'times', 'people', 'meet', 'see', 'other', 'middle', 'Manhattan', 'just', 'right', 'wrong', 'time', 'most', 'pivotal', 'incident', 'film', 'rather', 'fluky', 'manner', 'What', 'frustrating', 'contrivances', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'taken', 'out', 'changed', 'interfering', 'story', 'Still', 'cast', 'good', 'enough', 'plot', 'original', 'subtle', 'enough', 'make', 'memorable', 'compelling', 'film']",N/A

So when I got the blu-ray copy in it took me a while to get around to it. By the end of the film I realized I wasn't wrong in putting it off.Diane Lane plays Connie Sumner, a suburban housewife and mother who loves her husband Charlie (Richard Gere) and adores her son. On a trip to New York she finds herself in the midst of a wind storm and bumps into a young man named Paul (Olivier Martinez) carrying a load of books. They help one another up and he offers her the use of his bathroom to clean up and bandage a nasty scrape on her knee. This act of kindness ends up in flirtation but nothing comes of it. Until later.As she recalls the encounter, Connie ends up going back to meet with Paul and an affair ensues. Connie finds herself caught up in the moment, exhilarated by the secretive meetings and sexual involvement but at the same time knowing that she's putting her life back home in jeopardy. It's not that she's unhappy at home or that she's married to someone who treats her bad or ignores her, but she feels something is missing.Charlie becomes suspicious as Connie's attitude at home changes. The head of a security firm it doesn't take much for him to find someone to follow her and discover just what is going on. How he handles this, what he does after he discovers the affair makes up the latter part of the movie.This movie just felt like something that the actors walked through. I know during discussions in the extras (one of which is their appearance on the CHARLIE ROSE SHOW) they talk about the depth of their characters and the inner meanings of what transposes during the film, but I never felt that there was the depth that they speak of during interviews.Director Adrian Lyne has made a career out of sexually charged films in which his characters often toss aside the morality of the day to explore their more animal natures. 9 1/2 WEEKS, FATAL ATTRACTION, INDECENT PROPOSAL and LOLITA are just a few and to me I see a director obsessed with his own views of morality attempting to justify them rather than a film maker intent on making a good movie. In truth I was never a fan of any of these films and found them far too predictable. This one was the same with a slight twist but one that was unsatisfying.The film will find a number of viewers though. These will be fans of Lane, a beautiful woman who I am certain fills the dreams and imaginations of many lonely males in this world.

Lane cooly hijacks the movie as a comfortable but bored suburban housewife who lapses into an affair with a sexy French book dealer (Olivier Martinez).As Connie Sumner, Ms. Lane has very little dialogue to explain why she grasps at the promise of a dangerous fling, or how she withstands simultaneous torrents of guilt, fear, lust and joy, or what she thinks when she looks at her husband (Mr. Gere) and son (Erik Per Sullivan). There may be no words to explain those feelings, but I knew how she felt anyway, simply by watching her.

Their chemistry is what ultimately makes the film work.Adrian Lyne does well with the directing duties despite the predictable, obvious, and formulaic plot.

In that movie, Lyne portrays cheating as but the precursor to one of the parties concerned going predictably unglued and with tragic results.  Some ten years later, Lyne returns to the same theme in UNFAITHFUL, but this time, he shows a couple that on the surface seems content but as the viewer begins to dig through the onion layers that form the marriage, that viewer can see a wife Connie Sumner (Diane Lane), who ought to be happy that she has it all: a loving husband Edward, (Richard Gere), a cute young son, an affluent life style that affords her the leisure to while away the hours in volunteer fund raising.  But this superficial joviality lets the viewer know her grip on the marriage is weakening.  She is bored sexually with her husband and is fast approaching forty.  To an audience raised on the climate of fear first raised by Lyne in FATAL ATTRACTION, her problems are immediately evident.  It is no surprise, then, that Connie is set for an affair with a dashing Frenchman Paul (Olivier Martinez).  Their first rendevouz is a harmless meeting, with their doing nothing more than holding hands before her guilt propels her out the door.  Yet, clearly she will return, and when she does, their affair begins.  The sex scenes show a side of Connie totally lacking in the one scene of physical intimacy that she shares with her husband.  In that single scene, he joins her in a tub, and she quickly exits, leaving him to wonder why.  The various graphic scenes of sex contrapuntally set off what is missing in her marriage: a sense of daring that Paul can fulfil but Edward cannot.  Connie is seen as a bored woman who is warned by her best friend that all affairs turn out as disasters.  Edward, for his part, is a decent sort of man, but in the hands of Director Lyne, decency is not enough to ward off impending calamity.It is this sense of calamity that imbues UNFAITHFUL with more than a touch of a Lifetime movie of the week. Their relationship both before and after the affair is put under a microscope.  The predictability that dilutes the movie's impact is evident in the first few scenes.  With the focus of the marriage on Connie, given the not-so-subtle title, the viewer can follow the clearly marked roadsigns that point to one plot complication after another.  The only surprise is how the movie's core of violence will play itself out.  Given the choice that Director Lyne presents between showing the results of marital infidelity first found in FATAL ATTRACTION and then later in UNFAITHFUL, any spouse thinking of fooling around is more likely to be spooked by the violence of Glen Close in FATAL ATTRACTION than by the tepid ending of UNFAITHFUL.",3,The Consequence of Infidelity is: Predictable,1045526400,"02 18, 2003",2003,2777,"['Director', 'Adrian', 'Lyne', 'had', 'experience', 'marital', 'infidelity', 'film', 'FATAL', 'ATTRACTION', 'movie', 'Lyne', 'cheating', 'precursor', 'one', 'parties', 'concerned', 'going', 'predictably', 'unglued', 'tragic', 'results', 'ten', 'years', 'later', 'Lyne', 'same', 'theme', 'UNFAITHFUL', 'time', 'couple', 'surface', 'content', 'viewer', 'dig', 'onion', 'layers', 'form', 'marriage', 'viewer', 'can', 'see', 'wife', 'Connie', 'Sumner', 'Diane', 'Lane', 'who', 'ought', 'be', 'happy', 'loving', 'husband', 'Edward', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'cute', 'young', 'son', 'affluent', 'life', 'style', 'leisure', 'while', 'away', 'hours', 'volunteer', 'fund', 'raising', 'superficial', 'joviality', 'viewer', 'know', 'grip', 'marriage', 'weakening', 'bored', 'sexually', 'husband', 'fast', 'approaching', 'forty', 'audience', 'raised', 'climate', 'fear', 'first', 'raised', 'Lyne', 'FATAL', 'ATTRACTION', 'problems', 'are', 'immediately', 'evident', 'surprise', 'then', 'Connie', 'set', 'affair', 'dashing', 'Frenchman', 'Paul', 'Olivier', 'Martinez', 'first', 'rendevouz', 'harmless', 'meeting', 'doing', 'nothing', 'more', 'holding', 'hands', 'guilt', 'out', 'door', 'clearly', 'will', 'return', 'when', 'affair', 'sex', 'show', 'side', 'Connie', 'totally', 'lacking', 'one', 'scene', 'physical', 'intimacy', 'shares', 'husband', 'single', 'scene', 'tub', 'quickly', 'leaving', 'wonder', 'why', 'various', 'graphic', 'scenes', 'sex', 'contrapuntally', 'set', 'off', 'what', 'missing', 'marriage', 'sense', 'daring', 'Paul', 'can', 'fulfil', 'Edward', 'can', 'not', 'Connie', 'seen', 'bored', 'woman', 'who', 'warned', 'best', 'friend', 'affairs', 'turn', 'out', 'disasters', 'Edward', 'part', 'decent', 'sort', 'man', 'hands', 'Director', 'Lyne', 'decency', 'not', 'enough', 'ward', 'off', 'impending', 'calamity.It', 'sense', 'calamity', 'UNFAITHFUL', 'more', 'touch', 'Lifetime', 'movie', 'week', 'relationship', 'affair', 'put', 'microscope', 'predictability', 'movie', 'impact', 'evident', 'first', 'few', 'scenes', 'focus', 'marriage', 'Connie', 'given', 'not-so-subtle', 'title', 'viewer', 'can', 'follow', 'clearly', 'marked', 'roadsigns', 'point', 'one', 'plot', 'complication', 'only', 'surprise', 'how', 'movie', 'core', 'violence', 'will', 'play', 'out', 'Given', 'choice', 'Director', 'Lyne', 'presents', 'showing', 'results', 'marital', 'infidelity', 'first', 'found', 'FATAL', 'ATTRACTION', 'then', 'later', 'UNFAITHFUL', 'spouse', 'thinking', 'fooling', 'around', 'more', 'likely', 'be', 'spooked', 'violence', 'Glen', 'Close', 'FATAL', 'ATTRACTION', 'tepid', 'ending', 'UNFAITHFUL']",N/A
722383,A258YDD6553JA2,B00006RCNY,Mary F. Sibley,"[6, 7]","""Having an affair is nothing like taking a pottery class.  No, it would start out like that, and then something would happen; someone finds out or someone falls in love and it ends disastrously.  They always end disastrously.""With these words, Tracy (Kate Burton) gesticulates the story of a suburban wife, Connie Sumner (Diane Lane), who has edged out of the humdrum existence of life and into the rarified strata of an affair.Connie Sumner projects the aura of a woman dealing with a case of boredom and the sameness of life that has none of the gloss or glamour that perhaps enveloped her before her marriage to Edward (Richard Gere) eleven years before.  She has become a trooper; the mother of a precocious little boy; a Junior League bastion of acceptability in a rich suburb of New York City that has all the earmarks of upper middle class living.  The 19th century home on the lake, the extensive and manicured grounds, every blade of grass and hair in place, a handsome husband -- all hard won trophies that scream ""I have reached the pinnacle of success!""  And yet, when opportunity presents itself, Connie sets a course on a downward spiral that will end in the disastrous results that an affair must always betray.On an extremely mundane and windy day, she sets her sights on New York City to attend to some charity auction business.  In the process of trying to get down a street in Soho, she is literally swept into a man carrying an armload of books.  Both are knocked to the ground.  It is from this most innocent of beginnings that the torrid affair takes on a life of its own.  It is born and matures into a relationship that will culminate in less than desirable straits before its eventual termination.  Connie accepts the kindness of French book dealer, Paul Martel (Olivier Martinez), to bandage her knees which have suffered bloody unkindnesses, in his apartment.Connie is a woman in her late 30's or perhaps early 40's and Paul is 27 going on ""28 in July.""  The classic older woman, younger man syndrome.  She has fallen into dispute with her emotions and the danger that an affair brings with it.  That Martel betrays a scruffy, amourous, devil may care attitude about him, grasps her all the more to his person.  With her lover, she is young again and life seems somehow more exciting to the touch. She fails to realize what she is possibly throwing away by her actions as the pleasure factor has negated all reason.Diane Lane as Connie is superb.  Her performance is worth a thousand accolades.  She has etched a performance that is as intelligent as it it is forthright and unassuming.  The scene of her initial foray with Martel is breathtaking, as she is for all intents and purposes entering into forbidden territory with a quivering of her body, mind and soul.  A date with destiny and a pact with the devil have thus been sealed.  Ms. Lane's emotions run the gamut from boredom, elation, sexiness, disdain, anger and the firmest of convictions that she has become a rat in a maze of her own architecture.Richard Gere as Edward paints a portrait of a man whose life has achieved the heights reserved for those go-getters who have sought the challenge and won.  Gere plays dad, husband, lover and eventually, volcano on the edge of the boiling point that spills forth with fatal results.  His Edward conveys a wariness and uncertainty when he begins to suspect that there is ""something wrong"" with the new actions of his wife, and as the truth unfolds, as it must, a crescendo of complexity makes its appearance.Oliver Martinez as Paul Martel is that secret sin that most women prize -- a confection of French delight and smarmy actions that sizzle.  He is the honey which draws Connie into his arms, but morphs into a spider enticing her further into his web. The scene when Edward finally confronts him is priceless. It is put together like a puzzle, with each piece falling neatly into place until the crashing denouement rears its ugly head and we are left with a second story to absorb.The last third of the film stretches credibility slightly, although it is perfectly understandable to think that what happened did. While there are moments that shine through the tendency to slip into soap opera, a great deal of the time is spent trying to overcome the ""who did, I did"" of relationships that went asunder and why. The final moments of the film present the viewer with a game of ""what happened?"", rather like the Saki short story, ""The Lady or The Tiger."" Which path was chosen? What was the eventual outcome of it all?The music by Jan A. P. Kaczmarek is mesmerizing and rather like experiencing a lazy, summer day, touched with a tinge of sin and the long play of the wind as we drift to sleep to its steady beat.Director Adrian Lyne was inspired by the 1969 French film, ""La Femme infidele,"" directed and written by Claude Chabrol, as a basis for this current production. Lyne has crafted an adult drama that portrays the paths that people take when feeling out of sorts and what can and does happen because of them. His has drawn a performance from Diane Lane that is entirely credible and worthy of the Oscar nomination she has snared. The Academy would be well served to reward it, for she displays emotions and actions that induce a labour of consummate proportions. Here's hoping that rather than going with the ""safe bets"" that it tends to hug to its bosom, be they bigger names or studio efforts, it goes with a true acting extravaganza.Lyne's entire cast has melded together to bring adultery in all its compromising positions to the audience, and in the process has perhaps allowed us all to think twice before we leap into what we might have thought was nothing more than like ""taking a pottery class.""",4,A Cold Wind Blows,1092441600,"08 14, 2004",2004,5752,"['Having', 'affair', 'nothing', 'taking', 'pottery', 'class', 'No', 'would', 'start',

722385,A152C8GYY25HAH,B00006RCNY,Matthew Horner,"[2, 3]","""Unfaithful"" is an unorthodox thriller disguised as a conventional story of infidelity. By breaking the Hollywood rules of the genre, it risks alienating as many viewers as it enthralls. The plot outline itself has been used countless times: Wife meets sexy younger man. Passionate affair ensues. Husband finds out. All hell breaks loose.The wife is Connie Summer [Diane Lane]. She lives the good suburban life in Westchester County, NY with her husband, Edward [Richard Gere] and their young son. One windy day she goes to New York City where she literally bumps into a beautiful Frenchman named Paul [Oliver Martinez]. He invites her up to his apartment. Connie is aroused by this fascinating, intelligent, manipulative guy. He does not seduce her on the first visit. He waits for her to return, which she soon does, to begin the affair. They become obsessed with each other. It isn't long before her changed behavior alerts Edward to the fact that something is amiss. Eventually, he has a confrontation with Paul, but the meeting goes terribly wrong. Connie and Edward are left to deal with the aftermath of her affair.Here are some of the ways in which ""Unfaithful"" differs from ordinary thrillers: Connie does not stray because her husband is cold or psychotic; in fact, he's a nice guy whom she apparently loves. No reasons are given for why she falls for Paul. She does it for reasons of the heart, and who can ever reasonably explain such a thing? The police are not key characters in the story. Connie and Edward essentially deal with their problem alone. There is no pat conclusion. We are allowed to decide for ourselves what will become of them. Finally, there is no villain. The movie is empathetic towards everyone in this love triangle.The acting is uniformly good and is highlighted by a wonderful, award winning performance by Lane.",4,Unorthodox thriller highlighted by Diane Lane's performance,1040515200,"12 22, 2002",2002,1849,"['Unfaithful', 'unorthodox', 'thriller', 'disguised', 'conventional', 'story', 'infidelity', 'breaking', 'Hollywood', 'rules', 'genre', 'alienating', 'many', 'viewers', 'plot', 'outline', 'been', 'used', 'countless', 'times', 'Wife', 'meets', 'sexy', 'younger', 'man', 'Passionate', 'affair', 'ensues', 'Husband', 'out', 'hell', 'loose.The', 'wife', 'Connie', 'Summer', '[', 'Diane', 'Lane', ']', 'good', 'suburban', 'life', 'Westchester', 'County', 'NY', 'husband', 'Edward', '[', 'Richard', 'Gere', ']', 'young', 'son', 'One', 'windy', 'day', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'where', 'literally', 'bumps', 'beautiful', 'Frenchman', 'named', 'Paul', '[', 'Oliver', 'Martinez', ']', 'up', 'apartment', 'Connie', 'aroused', 'fascinating', 'intelligent', 'manipulative', 'guy', 'not', 'seduce', 'first', 'visit', 'return', 'soon', 'begin', 'affair', 'become', 'obsessed', 'other', ""n't"", 'long', 'changed', 'behavior', 'alerts', 'Edward', 'fact', 'something', 'amiss', 'Eventually', 'confrontation', 'Paul', 'meeting', 'terribly', 'wrong', 'Connie', 'Edward', 'are', 'left', 'deal', 'aftermath', 'are', 'ways', 'Unfaithful', 'differs', 'ordinary', 'thrillers', 'Connie', 'not', 'stray', 'husband', 'cold', 'psychotic', 'fact', 'nice', 'guy', 'whom', 'apparently', 'reasons', 'are', 'given', 'why', 'Paul', 'reasons', 'heart', 'who', 'can', 'ever', 'reasonably', 'explain', 'such', 'thing', 'police', 'are', 'not', 'key', 'characters', 'story', 'Connie', 'Edward', 'essentially', 'deal', 'problem', 'alone', 'pat', 'conclusion', 'are', 'allowed', 'decide', 'will', 'become', 'Finally', 'villain', 'movie', 'empathetic', 'towards', 'everyone', 'love', 'triangle.The', 'acting', 'uniformly', 'good', 'highlighted', 'wonderful', 'award', 'winning', 'performance', 'Lane']",N/A

Richard Gere did a very good job in the film and he was more likeable than his rather annoying wife. The wife was memorable in some scenes and quite over dramatic in others. I think she over acted in some scenes and the best acting accomplished by her was towards the end when she is being questioned by the cops. The sex scenes are uninspiring and hardly erotic, unless seeing two immature and neurotic adults having sex like  rabid dogs is your idea of "" sexy sex "". I thought the sex scene in the empty movie house was funny and dumb all at the same time. The French guy is utterly annoying with his contrived cheesy lines.

DALTON,"[4, 4]","Months before the award ceremonies that honoured 2002 began, there seemed to be an unspoken decision among the powers that be that the actress of the year would be Nicole Kidman for delivering what was essentially a supporting role in Stephen Daldry's brilliant film THE HOURS. A shame really. While Meryl Streep delivered what was arguably her finest work to date in the same film, the Actress of the year was undoubtedly Diane Lane for her honest, naked work in this perfectly realised melodrama. Adrian Lyne's best work always seems to spring forth when he examines women & their emotions. Sharing similarities with FATAL ATTRACTION in it's study of urban angst, the power of the film springs from a screenplay that doesn't justify Connie's(Diane Lane)behaviour. When we first meet her, it appears she has everything. A stable homelife, a handsome, loving husband & son. Literally crashing into a handsome bookdealer during a violent windstorm(aided by a very clever credit sequence..watch closely), Connie slowly but surely begins a hot, torrid affair. Unable to resist the temptation, watch her closely as she wrestles with herself(& with him). Her train trip home following her first sexual encounter is a wonder to behold. In flashback we are shown the encounter while Connie alternately laughs, cries, squirms & exalts as she rejoices in her own(almost new)sexuality. To watch her behaviour as she(& we)realizes how much her handsome new lover has set her free, the feeling is infectious. Ably supported by Richard Gere( a big year for this guy) & Olivier Martinez, Lyne delivers a film filled with honesty & warmth.

Lane is incredible as the suburban housewife who decides for some reason never explained to have an affair with a handsome Frenchman she bumps into during a windstorm.  Although to her credit, she does at first fight the temptation, she gives in and has a passionate, almost kinky sexual relationship with the dashing book dealer.  There are some incredibly powerful scenes where no words are spoken, especially when Lane after her first encounter with Paul, shows us the conflicting emotions of joy, humor, rage, and frustration, and she cries and laughs at the same time.  Lane's performance deservedly got her an Oscar nomination.  She is truly brilliant in this role.Richard Gere as her husband, Ed, is very good also, although his controlled performance stifled his rage; Olivier Martinez as Paul, the lover, is appropriately shallow and self-focused; he doesn't even tell Lane he's married (separated), and she finds him with another young lovely who he claims is a friend.  Eventually, the affair leads to a tragic ending, and one which only reinforces Lane's foolishness.  She even gives Paul a snowglobe that Gere had given her!

Diane Lane and Richard Gere star as Constance and Edward Sumner, a couple who live with their son, Charlie (Erik Per Sullivan) in an expensive-looking suburban home. All seems fine until a freakish windstorm literally blows Constance into Paul Martel (Olivier Martinez), a hunky New York City book dealer. To what will the flirtatious attraction between Paul and the older married woman lead?The performances in ""Unfaithful"" are first rate. Gere brings a lot of depth to this surprisingly likeable character, and Martinez is effective in his role. But much of the film belongs to Lane, and she really shines. She brings a potent mixture of emotions to life as we follow her character's path. Some of her best scenes are totally wordless; Lane needs only her body language and face to convey pages worth of dialogue.The script is well plotted, and there are some well realized production details; Paul's book-filled apartment is a particularly memorable visual image. But ultimately, I found ""Unfaithful"" somewhat unsatisfying; it felt like a morality play without enough payoff. After watching the film I had a feeling similar to that with which the film ""In the Bedroom"" left me.

An additional twist (if I may play with words) is the formidable tryst who is admirably played by the Frenchman Olivier Martinez. This versatile French actor may have dipped into a bit of his personal past when he sparred in the ring as a boxer to exchange both physical and more notably, mental blows with the respective leads. ""Unfaithful"" also has director Adrien Lynne returning to the infidelity theme he was successful in both his 1993 ""Indecent Proposal"" as well as his 1987 triumph, ""Fatal Attraction"" which is widely recognized as a landmark of the genre.

I wonder if we were watching the same film.UNFAITHFUL is the story of a housewife (Diane Lane) whose overactive libido makes her vulnerable to the seductive charms of a French bookseller (Olivier Martinez) whom she meets accidentally. The affair goes on for some time despite guilt pangs suffered by the housewife and in the face of growing suspicions by the husband (Richard Gere).The production values are good in UNFAITHFUL with many scenes set in New York City and the acting is good. The love scenes between the wife and her French lover are quite steamy.That's about all that's good in this movie.The plot suffers from too little conflict as there is no real villain in the piece. Reviews refer to UNFAITHFUL as a &quot;thriller&quot; but the application of that term to this movie is probably the result of not knowing how to categorize the movie and needing to classify it somehow. Without giving away any plot essentials, there is very little danger or threat of danger to the characters in UNFAITHFUL which might be expected were it a thriller.The plot leaves us guessing why the wife takes a lover as Richard Gere seems to the ideal husband except that maybe she is bored in the bedroom. I found UNFAITHFUL empty and without much content. The characters seemed to walk through the film with little motivation or feelings.The last half hour of the film was totally boring and had me dozing off. The soundtrack is forced and over dramatic at times and got on my nerves.This is a pedestrian project with little reason to identify or root for any of the characters.

However, this movie shows the dark side of what those fantasies can bring if they are brought to frightening fruition.Connie Sumner (excellently played by Diane Lane of ""The Outsiders"" fame) has the idyllic suburban life.  Her devoted husband is a handsome, successful businessman (the perfect role for Richard Gere), and they have an adorable young son.  She's happy, not even bored, with her marriage, and her life is filled with purpose.Then the stranger comes along, played by Olivier Martinez.  You don't even think anything is going to happen between them, really.  She fights against her temptations for a while and then suddenly succumbs to them.  On their first encounter, you can see her pangs of guilt, very well demonstrated in their first love scene.  But soon, she surrenders to her primordial instincts.Things go smoothly until you see the telltale signs she's having an affair in other aspects of her life.  Her organized family life becomes more disrupted, she pops in and surprises her husband at work bearing gifts....covering up her guilt.  He starts figuring things out and hires a PI to investigate, and he finds the man with whom his wife has been cheating.He confronts the gigolo, and then the interesting stuff starts to happen...This movie really reminded me of ""In the Bedroom"" in that it's about a relationship that is viewed as inappropriate and the unthinkable happens to tear it apart.  However, even though one would think the story would end at that point, the aftermath is what evolves as the interesting plot line.You see what happens when two people try to maintain the facade of happiness while in a tarnished relationship.  There is no way to repair what has happened, and the devoted husband hates the adulterous wife, but you know that they still love each other.  This struggle makes the story so provocative and emotionally gut-wrenching.This movie doesn't get 4 or 5 stars because I found the basic foundation for the affair ridiculous, and I couldn't help but just HATE Diane Lane's character through the whole thing.  It made me sick watching her fawn over this French gigolo like he was heroin.  It is not the type of movie I could watch over and over again, but it is still worth watching at least once.

She gets caught in wind storm and is blown into a mysterious stranger, Paul Martel.  His charm is felt by Connie but she resists.  But after a while she succumbs to his charms and an affair begins.Edward begins to suspect something is up and hires a private detective.  It is soon that the detective uncovers the affair.

It comes down to run or turn himself in.Director Adrienne Lynne has gone back to his Fatal Attraction themes and style.  This film depends on style and atmosphere and he gets a great cinematographer (Peter Biziou) and editor (Anne V Coates) to create both.

The end result is a fantastic film that explores the passions and consequences of cheating on a loved one.So many films dealing with the subject usually do one of two things, either create a spouse who is so vile and ruthless you're happy for the other to have an affair with someone who treats them right. Or the spouse who does the cheating is just a nasty person. Either way, only one is really a victim. In Unfaithful though, both spouses are victims. The affair just happens, as there usually is no strong reason. Real life doesn't always have a reason.

In this ""morality"" tale, Diane Lane plays a suburban mother / housewife / charity volunteer who has a hot affair with a french-accented book dealer.  When her husband, Richard Gere, becomes suspicious and later has his suspicions confirmed, a bad situation can only go to worse.The movie is a soap-opera.  It's fun, no question, but it clearly aspires to make some sort of grand statement...what, exactly, I don't know.  Perhaps that a guilty secret can be forgiven if you have an even bigger, more horrendous secret yourself?  I don't know.My biggest problem with the movie was Diane Lane's character.  She's terrific in the movie, and everyone always talked about the scene where she's riding the train home from her first tryst with her SoHo lover.  Her face goes from shame to lust to grief to excitement, all in the space of moments.  She does this well, and that's the main reason she got her Oscar nomination.  But we have NO idea why her character strays.  She has a gorgeous house, a kid she loves, a powerful husband who adores her and actually does things like come home in the evenings, help with dishes, ask about her day, etc.  She's not a neglected housewife.  I guess she must feel ""empty"" in some way...but taking up a dangerous affair with a seedy bookdealer who gives her a book of poetry by way of seduction is such a big leap for her character that I needed more.Her sex scenes are typical Lyne...lots of slapping and biting and toilet-stall love making.  Daring for the actors...icky to look at.The movie does finally get truly fascinating when the secret gets out.  What will Richard Gere do?  His confrontation scene with the lover is memorable and fascinating in a sick-to-your-stomach-imagining-this-is-happening-to-you kind of way.  I won't tell you anymore about what happens next because that could spoil the movie.Olivier Martinez plays the lover.  He's a cypher of a character and not at all sympathetic.  The women in the movie all think he's gorgeous, but my wife (and I) thought he was slimy.  To each his own.  Richard Gere, whose characters are usually pompous and full of themselves, has a new kind of vulnerability in the movie and emerges as its most sympathetic character.  I'm not a huge fan of his, but he was good in this...I can't deny it.I imagine this movie would entertain and fascinate any adults who are in a marriage (good or bad) or long-term relationship.

As with all the other films in that collection, Unfaithful ultimately conceals a deep conservatism under the libertine exterior, which is much of the ""something's wrong, but I can't put my finger on it"" feeling that often mars Lyne's work.The story is nothing out of the ordinary; the Sumners, Edward (Richard Gere) and Connie (Diane Lane) have a usual suburban marriage, stable and boring. Connie, by chance, meets the dashing Paul Martel (Olivier Martinez, recently seen in Before Night Falls), who finds her attractive, pursues her, and ultimately lures her into an extramarital affair, and everything goes downhill from there.It's not that what's been done before can't make for a good movie (Lyne's done it himself in Jacob's Ladder), and it's not that there aren't excellent stretches in this film. But upon reflection it does become a rather pedestrian piece of work. The first half of the film is paced far too slowly for this type of thriller, and a very, very badly cut last scene leaves the outcome of the film far too ambiguous (thankfully, the full scene is included in the deleted scenes section of the DVD). In between the film works quite well; the climax comes surprisingly early on, and unlike many recent films where that's the case, Unfaithful manages to keep the suspense going afterwards, as the lives of the characters spiral out of control in the aftermath of said climax.

722425,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00006RCNY,Roland E. Zwick,"[37, 50]","Like his earlier smash hit, ""Fatal Attraction,"" Adrian Lyne's ""Unfaithful"" is a cautionary tale for would-be adulterers.  More muted and less of a rabble-rouser than the previous film, this new work provides generally good, solid entertainment within the confines of its overworked genre.In terms of the plot, ""Unfaithful"" is really ""Fatal Attraction"" viewed from the other side.  In this case, it is the wife, not the husband, who becomes the philanderer, and the betrayed spouse, not the odd-angled home wrecker, who becomes the killer.  Richard Gere and Diane Lane star as Edward and Connie Sumner, a seemingly happily married couple who live with their son, Charlie, in a bucolic suburb of New York City.  One day, in the midst of an urban windstorm, Connie literally bumps into a handsome French hunk named Paul Martel (Olivier Martinez) with whom she ends up having an affair.  Paul's nationality is probably no arbitrary plot point since the Alvin Sargent/William Broyles Jr. screenplay is based on Claude Chabrol's famous 1969 film ""La Femme Infidel.""As a director, Lyne certainly knows how to spin a good yarn, and, despite the fact that everything that occurs on the screen seems conventional and familiar, we are, nevertheless, drawn into the emotional plight that this attractive woman finds herself going through.  As with all films of this type, ""Unfaithful"" features the obligatory scene wherein the adulterous party bumps into her gossipy girlfriends within a stone's throw of the new love interest and has to pretend that everything is hunky dory and peachy keen in her marriage.  We also have the inevitable sequence in which the bold lovers are passionately making out in a restaurant while an acquaintance of the woman, unbeknownst to her, is busy taking copious mental notes of the proceedings.  I also find it interesting that movies featuring female adulterers as main characters always seem to have an inordinately high number of scenes set on commuter trains.  This convention goes all the way back to the 1940's and David Lean's great film ""Brief Encounter"" and can be seen in 1984's ""Falling in Love"" with Meryl Streep as well.  It's just an observation, for what it's worth.Much of the success of ""Unfaithful"" can be attributed to Diane Lane, who manages to make her character both believable and touching, even in those moments when she is seen as being at her least morally attractive.  Though we may reject what she is doing on an intellectual level, we can certainly identify with the immense internal struggle she is going through between intense, physical passion on the one hand and a sense of duty to husband and family on the other.  Had the movie been content to play out the story in a more realistic way, it might have avoided the disappointment that comes in the second half.  I guess that the filmmakers felt that trying to resolve this dicey situation without resorting to melodrama would make for less of an impact at the box office, so we are confronted with the inevitable shift to a crime thriller scenario.  In a way, the filmmakers are to be congratulated for at least toning down this aspect of the plot, which - as it did in ""Fatal Attraction"" - could easily have spiraled off into over-the-top excess.  Yet, for some odd reason, the result of this subtle approach is, paradoxically, to give to the movie an unformed and unfinished feel, as it dribbles away into a lady-or-the-tiger copout ending.Although Lane does a beautiful job capturing the subtle emotional nuances of her character, the same cannot always be said for Gere, who comes across as stiff and stodgy much of the time.  Even worse is Olivier Martinez, who barely registers at all in the poorly written part of the dashing young lover.  In all fairness to the actor, however, one should note that he isn't really given much to work with here.  The real scene-stealer turns out to be young Erik Per Sullivan, the youngest brother from ""Malcolm in the Middle,"" who lights up the screen with his unaffected, good-natured charm.It's been a long time since I've seen Chabrol's ""La Femme Infidel,"" but I remember feeling, as I was watching that film, that, despite the fact that the story itself was conventional and almost hackneyed, I was in the hands of a master artist who could make me see truths contained in the material that I had never perceived before.

It tells the story of a seemingly happily married woman's affair with a handsome stranger, and how such a chance encounter can turn everyone's life upside down.There's a lot to intrigue the viewer in this movie--from the way the clandestine affair is revealed to the sordid aftermath.Diane Lane is amazing as always, and Richard Gere's performance will floor you. If you don't feel his character's pain, especially in the pivotal scene, you must not have a pulse.What's also amazing about this movie (kudos to director Lyne) is how fleshed-out the characters are. Whereas in many films of this genre the viewer knows just whom to blame, whom to call the villain, whom to call the victim, this one, on the other hand, portrays each character with depth and empathy, blurring the lines between good and evil, accident and purposefulness, right and wrong.This film is also beautifully filmed--a lot of sepia tones (maybe a statement as to the haziness of good and bad as portrayed in the film)--and the music by Jan A.P.

722431,A2PNTEDGMOLMOY,B00006RCNY,Scott Schiefelbein,"[9, 9]","Adrian Lyne's ""Unfaithful"" is, in many respects, a spin through familiar waters for the director -- the crushing impact of infidelity on a marriage. After all, this is the man who directed two other notorious films on the subject -- ""Fatal Attraction"" and ""Indecent Proposal.""  While there are similarities between all three films, ""Unfaithful"" is the strongest of the three because it is the most intelligent.In an Oscar-nominated performance, Diane Lane plays Constance Sumner, beloved-and-somewhat-bored wife and mother.  That her husband is Edward, played by Richard Gere (very sexy as always, but in a mainstream way), seems to be small consolation to her as she rattles around her waterfront Westchester County neo-mansion and cares for her lovely-yet-slightly-troubled son, Charlie (Erik Per Sullivan, unfortunately denied any of the zaniness he exhibits as the youngest son on TV's ""Malcom in the Middle"").  Constance is one of those ""housewives"" who has a maid to keep the house in order, freeing her up to take trips into Manhattan to organize charity events.Lyne subtly creates a sense of tension from the very first scenes in the Sumner household.  This is one heck of a beautiful house on a beautiful lake filled with beautiful people, but the colors have been leeched out of everything.  From the wondrous foliage to the handsome clothes, everything is a muted shade of brown or gray . . . even the reds and blues.  This is not the bright, joyous household it should be.  A gift of a strikingly blue sweater introduces a jarring note into this marriage.Thus we are not surprised when, on a trip into SoHo on perhaps the windiest day of the year, Constance bumps into Paul Martel (Olivier Martinez), a Frenchman who looks like a cover model but is in fact a Bohemian book dealer living in one of those wonderful industrio-residential New York flats.  Constance tries vainly to hail a cab, but is unsuccessful and is ""forced"" to go up to Paul's apartment . . . although it appears that she kinda-sorta lets one last cab go by unhailed before heading upstairs.Paul, convinced of his Gallic charm and good looks, instantly sets out seducing Constance, but in a restrained way.  He offers her a book from his mammoth collection, tells her exactly which book to pick up, which page to turn to, and which passage to read -- lines which are classic ""carpe diem"" sentiments for those about to cast aside virtue.  As Paul says later, in an exercise of Euro-trash philosophy, ""There are no mistakes.  Only things you do and things you do not do.""While Constance initially refuses his advances, it is no spoiler that in a movie titled ""Unfaithful"" that she ultimately succumbs and engages in a tumultuous affair.  (This, by the way, is an affair that allows Lyne to cover the near-pornographic ground he failed to cover in his earlier film, ""9 1/2 Weeks,"" as Constance and Paul have encounters in theaters, bathrooms, hallways, and even occasionally the bed.)Lane, who almost always plays a likeable character, plays a real rhymes-with-witch in ""Unfaithful.""  Why?  Because she is not driven into this affair -- she chooses to engage in it.  Why?  Because Paul excites her, and Edward doesn't.  Sure, Edward is a bit of a workaholic, and their marriage (11 years in) is in a bit of a rut.  But just like you screamed at Michael Douglas for cheating on Anne Archer in ""Fatal Attraction"" (as in, ""What the hell are you thinking, you schmuck?""), you want to scream at Constance for dismissing her marriage so casually.Sure, Constance is conflicted.  She even introduces herself to Paul as ""Constance,"" as if the implication of morality (""Constance"" = ""constancy"") will help her fend of this Lothario.  In a delightful, subtle jab at her, Edward keeps referring to her as ""Connie,"" with its implications of immorality (""Connie"" = ""con"" = ""con-job"").  But even when she tries to break it off ""before anyone gets hurt,"" she relents when Paul says, ""I'd get hurt.""  Well, too darn bad, bub, we want to say, but Constance wouldn't hear us, anyway.Ultimately, Edward discovers the affair, and he tracks down Paul.  This is where the movie comes to life -- Edward, Constance, and even Paul each attempt to resolve this unresolvable situation as best they can -- we thankfully do not undergo a reprise of Glenn Close's meltdown in ""Fatal Attraction.""Solid performances by Gere and Martinez anchor the film, while Lane reaches new heights as she runs the gamut of boredom to anticipation to regret to delight to anguish.  This is a film to be discussed, where the characters are human, and can occasionally be moved to inhuman heights and depths.  Check it out.The DVD has the standard extras, including deleted scenes and an alternate ending.  The director's commentary is helpful, except for his dissertation on why he likes to live in Provence, France, while reading and writing screenplays -- it added nothing to my understanding of the film, and made me insanely jealous.  Other than that, a good DVD for a very good film.",4,Tale of Infidelity Succeeds Through Restraint,1108425600,"02 15, 2005",2005,5017,"['Adrian', 'Lyne', 'Unfaithful', 'many', 'respects', 'spin', 'familiar', 'waters', 'director', 'crushing', 'impact', 'infidelity', 'marriage', 'man', 'who', 'directed', 'two', 'other', 'notorious', 'films', 'subject', 'Fatal', 'Attraction', 'Indecent', 'Proposal', 'are', 'similarities', 'three', 'films', 'Unfaithful', 'strongest', 'three', 'most', 'intelligent.In', 'Oscar-nominated', 'performance', 'Diane', 'Lane', 'Constance', 'Sumner', 'beloved-and-somewhat-bored', 'wife', 'mother', 'husband', 'Edward', 'played', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'very', 'sexy', 'always', 'mainstream', 'way', 'be', 'small', 'consolation', 'waterfront', 'Westchester', 'County', 'neo-mansion', 'cares', 'lovely-yet-slightly-troubled', 'son', 'Charlie', 'Erik', 'Per', 'Sullivan', 'unfortunately', 'denied', 'zaniness', 'youngest', 'son', 'TV', 'Malcom', 'Middle', 'Constance', 'one', 'housewives', 'who', 'maid', 'keep', 'house', 'order', 'freeing', 'up', 'take', 'trips', 'Manhattan', 'organize', 'charity', 'events.Lyne', 'subtly', 'sense', 'tension', 'very', 'first', 'scenes', 'Sumner', 'household', 'one', 'heck', 'beautiful', 'house', 'beautiful', 'lake', 'filled', 'beautiful', 'people', 'colors', 'have', 'been', 'leeched', 'everything', 'wondrous', 'foliage', 'handsome', 'clothes', 'everything', 'muted', 'shade', 'brown', 'gray', 'even', 'reds', 'blues', 'not', 'bright', 'joyous', 'household', 'should', 'be', 'gift', 'strikingly', 'blue', 'sweater', 'jarring', 'note', 'marriage.Thus', 'are', 'not', 'surprised', 'when', 'trip', 'SoHo', 'perhaps', 'windiest', 'day', 'year', 'Constance', 'bumps', 'Paul', 'Martel', 'Olivier', 'Martinez', 'Frenchman', 'who', 'cover', 'model', 'fact', 'Bohemian', 'book', 'dealer', 'living', 'one', 'wonderful', 'industrio-residential', 'New', 'York', 'flats', 'Constance', 'vainly', 'hail', 'cab', 'unsuccessful', 'forced', 'go', 'up', 'Paul', 'apartment', 'kinda-sorta', 'one', 'last', 'cab', 'go', 'unhailed', 'heading', 'upstairs.Paul', 'convinced', 'Gallic', 'charm', 'good', 'looks', 'instantly', 'out', 'seducing', 'Constance', 'restrained', 'way', 'book', 'mammoth', 'collection', 'exactly', 'book', 'pick', 'up', 'page', 'turn', 'passage', 'read', 'lines', 'are', 'classic', 'carpe', 'diem', 'sentiments', 'cast', 'aside', 'virtue', 'Paul', 'later', 'exercise', 'Euro-trash', 'philosophy', 'are', 'mistakes', 'Only', 'things', 'do', 'things', 'do', 'not', 'do', 'Constance', 'initially', 'advances', 'spoiler', 'movie', 'titled', 'Unfaithful', 'ultimately', 'succumbs', 'engages', 'tumultuous', 'affair', 'way', 'affair', 'Lyne', 'cover', 'near-pornographic', 'ground', 'failed', 'cover', 'earlier', 'film', '9', '1/2', 'Weeks', 'Constance', 'Paul', 'have', 'encounters', 'theaters', 'bathrooms', 'hallways', 'even', 'occasionally', 'bed', 'Lane', 'who', 'almost', 'always', 'likeable', 'character', 'real', 'rhymes-with-witch', 'Unfaithful', 'Why', 'not', 'driven', 'affair', 'engage', 'Why', 'Paul', 'Edward', ""n't"", 'Sure', 'Edward', 'bit', 'workaholic', 'marriage', '11', 'years', 'bit', 'rut', 'just', 'screamed', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'cheating', 'Anne', 'Archer', 'Fatal', 'Attraction', 'What', 'hell', 'are', 'thinking', 'schmuck', 'want', 'scream', 'Constance', 'dismissing', 'marriage', 'so', 'casually.Sure', 'Constance', 'conflicted', 'even', 'Paul', 'Constance', 'implication', 'morality', 'Constance', '=', 'constancy', 'will', 'help', 'fend', 'Lothario', 'delightful', 'subtle', 'jab', 'Edward', 'referring', 'Connie', 'implications', 'immorality', 'Connie', '=', 'con', 'con-job', 'even', 'when', 'break', 'off', 'anyone', 'hurt', 'when', 'Paul', ""'d"", 'get', 'hurt', 'Well', 'too', 'darn', 'bad', 'bub', 'want', 'say', 'Constance', 'would', ""n't"", 'hear', 'anyway.Ultimately', 'Edward', 'affair', 'down', 'Paul', 'where', 'movie', 'life', 'Edward', 'Constance', 'even', 'Paul', 'attempt', 'resolve', 'unresolvable', 'situation', 'can', 'thankfully', 'do', 'not', 'undergo', 'reprise', 'Glenn', 'Close', 'meltdown', 'Fatal', 'Attraction', 'Solid', 'performances', 'Gere', 'Martinez', 'anchor', 'film', 'Lane', 'new', 'heights', 'gamut', 'boredom', 'anticipation', 'regret', 'delight', 'anguish', 'film', 'be', 'discussed', 'where', 'characters', 'are', 'human', 'can', 'occasionally', 'be', 'moved', 'inhuman', 'heights', 'depths', 'Check', 'out.The', 'DVD', 'standard', 'extras', 'including', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'alternate', 'ending', 'director', 'commentary', 'helpful', 'dissertation', 'why', 'live', 'Provence', 'France', 'reading', 'writing', 'screenplays', 'added', 'nothing', 'understanding', 'film', 'made', 'insanely', 'jealous', 'Other', 'good', 'DVD', 'very', 'good', 'film']",N/A
722432,A39Y2IQ99V7CC9,B00006RCNY,"SEP ""sepowe""","[11, 12]","I had a great time watching this film all by myself on a rainy Saturday afternoon.  It was cold outside, but the theater was sizzling.  The movie poster for this flick promises eroticism, passion, and raw sexuality . . . and it delivers.  Nobody ever said this was a thought-provoking masterpiece that would linger with viewers for days to come.  It isn't.The plot of this film is somewhat threadbare.  Diane Lane is Constance Sumner, a content, but somewhat bored and unstimulated, housewife in the New York City suburbs.  Her life revolves around her husband and 8-year-old son, Charlie.  Charlie, in fact, was the entire reason Constance found herself in the City on the fateful day she met Paul Martel, the French hunk portrayed by Olivier Martinez.  Intent on organizing a charity auction for Charlie's school, Constance finds herself besieged by an urban windstorm, and she literally bumps into Martel on the street.  After allowing him to tend her skinned kneee, Constance finds herself swept into a capricious passion with the much-younger man.  They carry on for several weeks, taking risks and getting more careless as time passes.  Constance is a horrible liar and her husband soon grows suspicious.  His heartbreaking realization that his wife has been unfaithful leads the beginning of the end of all their lives.Of all the characters in this film, the only one that evolves much beyond the first 15 minutes is Martinez's character, Paul.  The audience learns more and more about him as the film progresses.  Constance begins the film as a bored housewife and end the film as a frantic, guilty housewife whose future is horribly bleak and uncertain.  Richard Gere's character, Edward Sumner (a man so boring he seemed be a born cuckold), is disappointingly flat.Look folks:  this movie was promoted as erotic and that's really all it is.  Those who claim it's more interested in sex tnan in hearts and minds would be right.  That doesn't make it a bad film.  I enjoyed it, and seeing it alone was no big deal because there really was little to discuss afterwards.

722434,A1FCWRSICTO2AH,B00006RCNY,S. Harris,"[3, 5]","Unfaithful is not a very good movie.  The movie is weighted down from the start with its numerous cliches, the biggest one being the French lover Paul Martel (Oliver Martinez) to suburban wife Constance Summer (Diane Lane).  At one point, before Constance gives in to her passion, Martel tells her - to help her put aside her guilt - ""There's only what you do, and what you don't do.""  Indeed.  Considering Martel's fate, I had to appreciate the unintentional irony of his code.  Why is it unintentional?  Well, you should see the weapon of choice - it would make Spielburg blush with shame. There's no way a movie operating at such a superficial level could work in intelligent irony.  Overall, I'm tempted to give this one star, but Gere has a good confrontation moment with Martel that looked to me like good acting.  And Lane - between couplings - had a good acting moment on the train.  Emotions - joy, amazement, guilt - crossed her face in a believable fashion that proved she could act with her clothes on.  Nevertheless, such moments aside, Unfaithful is Hollywood's A-Movie attempt at soft porn.

Diane Lane and Richard Gere playing a married couple with one child and no apparent marital problems, that is until Lane meets a handsome and sexy book collector in the city and soon she begins an affair with the man and tries to hide it from her husband. This affair soon becomes deadly and both Gere and Lane land themselves up in the middle of mess with the police with a very deadly secret.Why is this movie so great? Well, the actors are amazing, the plot and story just seem to draw you in and not let you go from beginning to end. The score beefs the thrills up a huge notch also. The sex is amazing and very steamy, I must admit I enjoyed watching the movie for simply that reason. This film was brilliantly directed and it seems a lot of work and effort went into this sleeper hit, and it shows. If you're into adult thrillers, or even just greatly written, acted and directed films, this is a must own. One of the greatest things I loved about this film was the fact that Lane never tried to explain as to why she was cheating, she never had an excuse, it was just something she did to feel good for the time being and felt guilty for afterwards. Which in turn is great and symbolizes human beings, that everyone has dark secrets we feel guilty about, we can't help but do them and even though we know it's wrong, we have noone or nothing to blame but our own selfish lust.One great movie, I loved it!",5,One of the best movies!,1039996800,"12 16, 2002",2002,1482,"['do', ""n't"", 'know', 'where', 'begin', 'tell', 'just', 'how', 'amazing', 'film', 'Diane', 'Lane', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'playing', 'married', 'couple', 'one', 'child', 'apparent', 'marital', 'problems', 'Lane', 'handsome', 'sexy', 'book', 'collector', 'city', 'soon', 'affair', 'man', 'tries', 'hide', 'husband', 'affair', 'soon', 'deadly', 'Gere', 'Lane', 'land', 'up', 'middle', 'mess', 'police', 'very', 'deadly', 'secret.Why', 'movie', 'so', 'great', 'Well', 'actors', 'are', 'amazing', 'plot', 'story', 'just', 'seem', 'draw', 'not', 'let', 'go', 'beginning', 'end', 'score', 'beefs', 'thrills', 'up', 'huge', 'notch', 'also', 'sex', 'amazing', 'very', 'steamy', 'must', 'admit', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'movie', 'simply', 'reason', 'film', 'was', 'brilliantly', 'directed', 'lot', 'work', 'effort', 'went', 'sleeper', 'hit', ""'re"", 'adult', 'thrillers', 'even', 'just', 'greatly', 'written', 'acted', 'directed', 'films', 'must', 'own', 'One', 'greatest', 'things', 'loved', 'film', 'was', 'fact', 'Lane', 'never', 'tried', 'explain', 'why', 'was', 'cheating', 'never', 'had', 'excuse', 'was', 'just', 'something', 'did', 'feel', 'good', 'time', 'being', 'felt', 'guilty', 'afterwards', 'Which', 'turn', 'great', 'symbolizes', 'human', 'beings', 'everyone', 'dark', 'secrets', 'feel', 'guilty', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'do', 'even', 'know', 'wrong', 'have', 'noone', 'nothing', 'blame', 'own', 'selfish', 'lust.One', 'great', 'movie', 'loved']",N/A
722440,A2UW83R0JOZZ6,B00006RCNY,S. Schell,"[5, 6]","Adrian Lyne loves covering the topic of adultery and ""Unfaithful"" is no exception to the rule, much in the vein of his more renowned ""Fatal Attraction"".  Based on Claude Chabrol's ""La Femme Infidele"", it is the story of a risky extramarital affair and this time the adulterer is the wife.Diane Lane is Connie Sumner, a young and radiant housewife raising eight-year old son Charlie (Per Sullivan) in a Shangri-La section of rural New York with Edward (Gere), her husband of eleven years.  On her way one morning to pick some things up for an auction, powerful gusts of wind literally sweep her into the arms of a young French bookdealer named Paul Martel (Martinez).  Paul is tempting, debonair and handsome, luring Connie not only into his apartment to bandage her skinned knees but also into his bed several times in the near future.  Connie is frightened by potency of her attraction to Paul but nonetheless begins a rabid love affair with him, her tightly scheduled and mundane lifestyle becoming reckless and self-indulgent.Edward's insecurities and jealous-husband radar pick up on Connie's extracurricular activities and he hires a private detective to follow her.  His suspicions confirmed by several black and white photos with Paul and Connie necking and prancing around town, he decides to confront his wife's playboy and their meeting does not end well.  The course of events after their encounter is strange and unpredictable, the movie's ending left open to interpretation, viewers drawing their own conclusions as to what may or may not have happened.Reworking Chabrol's story are veteran screenwriters Alvin Sargent and William Broyles, Jr., the former known for his screenplays for ""White Palace"" and ""Other People's Money"" and the latter gaining critical acclaim for his screenplay to Steven Spielberg's ""Cast Away"".  Of course, what makes this movie appealing is not necessarily the dialogue but the execution of its actors and the steamy love scenes between Diane Lane and Olivier Martinez.Lane is fantastic.  Her best moments on screen contain no dialogue, only the transmittal of raw emotion through her face and body.  Her scene on the subway train after her first close encounter with Paul is mesmerizing; sighing with ecstasy, smiling and even nervously laughing amidst a river of guilty tears, Connie fights the emotions stirring inside of her and Lane boldly executes her inner turmoil.Gere is fair, still retaining that roguish and tousled look of a man in his thirties.  Although he is capable of giving a guts-and-glory performance, the story lends Lane the spotlight and Gere the shadow.  Olivier Martinez, a relatively new face to the big screen, gives Paul that sex appeal that all European men seem to reap from American women with the greatest of ease (not hard, being a real ""homme de Paris"", n'est ce pas?).Although ""Unfaithful"" is as entertaining as its precursor ""Fatal Attraction"", a lot of issues are left up in the air.  Why did Connie have an affair with Paul?  Did the jealousy of her husband drive her away?  Was it the need for a significant spice in the mediocrity of her life?  Was Connie simply too weak to resist temptation and Paul much too persuasive?  Did she rationalize her decision to have an affair or did she simply act on impulse?  From whence do Edward's insecurities stem?  Of course, these questions will never be answered because Lyne is the kind of director who relishes the varied interpretations of his audience, never revealing the ""true"" meaning behind unfolding events.For the most part, ""Unfaithful"" is slick entertainment for people who crave a good deal of sexual titillation with their rental price.  They will be assured plenty of it and some good performances to boot.",3,Alluring Infidelity,1044748800,"02 9, 2003",2003,3743,"['Adrian', 'Lyne', 'covering', 'topic', 'adultery', 'Unfaithful', 'exception', 'rule', 'much', 'vein', 'more', 'renowned', 'Fatal', 'Attraction', 'Based', 'Claude', 'Chabrol', 'La', 'Femme', 'Infidele', 'story', 'risky', 'extramarital', 'affair', 'time', 'adulterer', 'wife.Diane', 'Lane', 'Connie', 'Sumner', 'young', 'radiant', 'housewife', 'raising', 'eight-year', 'old', 'son', 'Charlie', 'Per', 'Sullivan', 'Shangri-La', 'section', 'rural', 'New', 'York', 'Edward', 'Gere', 'husband', 'eleven', 'years', 'way', 'one', 'morning', 'pick', 'things', 'up', 'auction', 'powerful', 'gusts', 'wind', 'literally', 'sweep', 'arms', 'young', 'French', 'bookdealer', 'named', 'Paul', 'Martel', 'Martinez', 'Paul', 'tempting', 'debonair', 'handsome', 'luring', 'Connie', 'not', 'only', 'apartment', 'bandage', 'skinned', 'knees', 'also', 'bed', 'several', 'times', 'near', 'future', 'Connie', 'frightened', 'potency', 'attraction', 'Paul', 'nonetheless', 'rabid', 'love', 'affair', 'tightly', 'scheduled', 'mundane', 'lifestyle', 'becoming', 'reckless', 'self-indulgent.Edward', 'insecurities', 'jealous-husband', 'radar', 'pick', 'up', 'Connie', 'extracurricular', 'activities', 'private', 'detective', 'follow', 'suspicions', 'confirmed', 'several', 'black', 'white', 'photos', 'Paul', 'Connie', 'necking', 'prancing', 'around', 'town', 'confront', 'wife', 'playboy', 'meeting', 'not', 'end', 'well', 'course', 'events', 'encounter', 'strange', 'unpredictable', 'movie', 'ending', 'left', 'open', 'interpretation', 'viewers', 'drawing', 'own', 'conclusions', 'what', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'happened.Reworking', 'Chabrol', 'story', 'are', 'veteran', 'screenwriters', 'Alvin', 'Sargent', 'William', 'Broyles', 'Jr.', 'former', 'known', 'screenplays', 'White', 'Palace', 'Other', 'People', 'Money', 'latter', 'gaining', 'critical', 'acclaim', 'screenplay', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'Cast', 'Away', 'course', 'what', 'movie', 'appealing', 'not', 'necessarily', 'dialogue', 'execution', 'actors', 'steamy', 'love', 'scenes', 'Diane', 'Lane', 'Olivier', 'Martinez.Lane', 'fantastic', 'best', 'moments', 'screen', 'contain', 'dialogue', 'only', 'transmittal', 'raw', 'emotion', 'face', 'body', 'scene', 'subway', 'train', 'first', 'close', 'encounter', 'Paul', 'mesmerizing', 'sighing', 'ecstasy', 'smiling', 'even', 'nervously', 'laughing', 'amidst', 'river', 'guilty', 'tears', 'Connie', 'emotions', 'stirring', 'inside', 'Lane', 'boldly', 'inner', 'fair', 'still', 'retaining', 'roguish', 'tousled', 'look', 'man', 'thirties', 'capable', 'giving', 'guts-and-glory', 'performance', 'story', 'Lane', 'spotlight', 'Gere', 'shadow', 'Olivier', 'Martinez', 'relatively', 'new', 'face', 'big', 'screen', 'Paul', 'sex', 'appeal', 'European', 'men', 'seem', 'reap', 'American', 'women', 'greatest', 'ease', 'not', 'hard', 'being', 'real', 'homme', 'de', 'Paris', ""n'est"", 'ce', 'pas', 'Unfaithful', 'as', 'entertaining', 'precursor', 'Fatal', 'Attraction', 'lot', 'issues', 'are', 'left', 'up', 'air', 'Why', 'did', 'Connie', 'have', 'affair', 'Paul', 'Did', 'jealousy', 'husband', 'drive', 'away', 'Was', 'need', 'significant', 'spice', 'mediocrity', 'life', 'Was', 'Connie', 'simply', 'too', 'weak', 'resist', 'temptation', 'Paul', 'much', 'too', 'persuasive', 'Did', 'rationalize', 'decision', 'have', 'affair', 'did', 'simply', 'act', 'impulse', 'whence', 'do', 'Edward', 'insecurities', 'stem', 'course', 'questions', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'answered', 'Lyne', 'kind', 'director', 'who', 'varied', 'interpretations', 'audience', 'never', 'revealing', 'true', 'meaning', 'unfolding', 'most', 'part', 'Unfaithful', 'slick', 'entertainment', 'people', 'who', 'crave', 'good', 'deal', 'sexual', 'titillation', 'rental', 'price', 'will', 'be', 'assured', 'plenty', 'good', 'performances', 'boot']",N/A
722441,A1PKFRC06WA7TN,B00006RCNY,"Stephanie Dray ""Author of Lily of the Nile""","[14, 15]","This movie avoids the easy out that most films of its kind take--the cliche tale of the psycho lover or cold, controlling spouse. Instead, this movie reaches a careful balance where all three characters are sympathetic, even when they are doing ghastly things.It would have been easy to make the husband a jerk.  Instead, he is a basically decent man who has some problems with communication, greed, and managing his emotions.It would have been easy to make the wife shallow and selfish so that we loathe her for doing this to her family.  Instead, she is a good mother, generous person, and loving wife who makes one mistake after the other as she gets caught up in an immoral indulgence.Finally, it would be easiest of all to make the lover a psycho.  Instead, we get Paul--a compassionate and tender caretaker who loves books.  He's also a reckless, arrogant, womanizer, but the movie is careful to temper that with his good qualities.People who think this film is about a bored housewife and a sexually violent boyfriend didn't bring enough experience or attention to the film, I fear.Connie is boxed in, not bored.  She spends every day taking care of her son and her husband, the house, and other people in her charity work.  She is the consummate care-taker, a crone before her time, locked into that role by her choices.  Her husband is a decent person who loves her, but he is portrayed from the start as a big child.  She has to tell the family what to wear, what to eat, where to be, and what to say.  She controls and takes care of everything.When she meets Paul, she finds someone who takes care of her for a change, even though he is much younger.  From the start, he tends to her wounds.  He indulges her girlishness, and teaches her new things.  And yes, he exerts physical but _consensual_ control over her in the bedroom.This movie doesn't have any rape scenes in it.  People who think otherwise must have missed oh-so-subtle indications of consent such as her _literally asking him to do what he's doing_.The sex scenes are intensely passionate.  Raw base recklessness is portrayed on the screen.  In particular, Diane Lane manages to portray a girlish, trembling eroticism that makes the viewer hold in breath to behold. She perfectly captures a mixture of laughter, trembling and tears--the sound of anguished surrender.Moreover, the affair itself is tenderness.  Again, it would have been very easy to make the relationship about a mere physical affair, but the script goes to great lengths to make it an emotional affair as well.  The most wounding thing to Connie's husband is not the sex, but the intimacy his wife shared with another man behind his back.The confrontation between the husband and the lover is the best scene I've ever seen from Richard Gere, and a scene likely to haunt long after you've put this film away.The mood evoked is meloncholy--sadness over the follies of human beings, over what good people can do when they lack courage, and how sexual needs are sometimes man's downfall.  Overall, this is a sophistocated tale of choices, consequences, and some deep truths about lies, marriage, fidelity, and intimacy.",5,Excellent and Nuanced Tale,1059868800,"08 3, 2003",2003,3157,"['movie', 'easy', 'out', 'most', 'films', 'kind', 'take', 'cliche', 'tale', 'psycho', 'lover', 'cold', 'controlling', 'spouse', 'Instead', 'movie', 'careful', 'balance', 'where', 'three', 'characters', 'are', 'sympathetic', 'even', 'when', 'are', 'doing', 'ghastly', 'things.It', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'easy', 'make', 'husband', 'jerk', 'Instead', 'basically', 'decent', 'man', 'who', 'problems', 'communication', 'greed', 'managing', 'emotions.It', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'easy', 'make', 'wife', 'shallow', 'selfish', 'so', 'loathe', 'doing', 'family', 'Instead', 'good', 'mother', 'generous', 'person', 'loving', 'wife', 'who', 'one', 'mistake', 'other', 'caught', 'up', 'immoral', 'indulgence.Finally', 'would', 'be', 'easiest', 'make', 'lover', 'psycho', 'Instead', 'get', 'Paul', 'compassionate', 'tender', 'caretaker', 'who', 'books', 'also', 'reckless', 'arrogant', 'womanizer', 'movie', 'careful', 'temper', 'good', 'qualities.People', 'who', 'think', 'film', 'bored', 'housewife', 'sexually', 'violent', 'boyfriend', 'did', ""n't"", 'bring', 'enough', 'experience', 'attention', 'film', 'fear.Connie', 'boxed', 'not', 'bored', 'day', 'taking', 'care', 'son', 'husband', 'house', 'other', 'people', 'charity', 'work', 'consummate', 'care-taker', 'crone', 'time', 'locked', 'role', 'choices', 'husband', 'decent', 'person', 'who', 'portrayed', 'start', 'big', 'child', 'tell', 'family', 'what', 'wear', 'what', 'eat', 'where', 'be', 'what', 'say', 'care', 'everything.When', 'Paul', 'someone', 'who', 'care', 'change', 'even', 'much', 'younger', 'start', 'wounds', 'girlishness', 'new', 'things', 'yes', 'physical', '_consensual_', 'control', 'bedroom.This', 'movie', ""n't"", 'have', 'rape', 'scenes', 'People', 'who', 'think', 'otherwise', 'must', 'have', 'missed', 'oh-so-subtle', 'indications', 'consent', 'such', '_literally', 'asking', 'do', 'what', 'doing_.The', 'sex', 'scenes', 'are', 'intensely', 'passionate', 'Raw', 'base', 'recklessness', 'portrayed', 'screen', 'particular', 'Diane', 'Lane', 'portray', 'girlish', 'trembling', 'eroticism', 'viewer', 'hold', 'breath', 'behold', 'perfectly', 'mixture', 'laughter', 'trembling', 'tears', 'sound', 'anguished', 'surrender.Moreover', 'affair', 'tenderness', 'Again', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'easy', 'make', 'relationship', 'mere', 'physical', 'affair', 'script', 'great', 'lengths', 'make', 'emotional', 'affair', 'as', 'well', 'most', 'wounding', 'thing', 'Connie', 'husband', 'not', 'sex', 'intimacy', 'wife', 'shared', 'man', 'back.The', 'confrontation', 'husband', 'lover', 'best', 'scene', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'scene', 'likely', 'haunt', 'long', ""'ve"", 'put', 'film', 'away.The', 'mood', 'evoked', 'meloncholy', 'sadness', 'follies', 'human', 'beings', 'what', 'good', 'people', 'can', 'do', 'when', 'lack', 'courage', 'how', 'sexual', 'needs', 'are', 'sometimes', 'man', 'downfall', 'Overall', 'sophistocated', 'tale', 'choices', 'consequences', 'deep', 'truths', 'lies', 'marriage', 'fidelity', 'intimacy']",N/A

When she is with or thinking of her lover Paul (Olivier Martinez) she glistens with erotic ambience; yet in scenes with husband Ed (Richard Gere), she is clearly a devoted, intelligent, well-organized wife and mother.  ""Well-organized"" that is, until she is completely engulfed by the dangers, excitement and helplessness of her passion.""Unfaithful"" opens quietly on a family waking up for the day in their opulent suburban home.  Contentment, love and stability infuse the scene.  When the door opens for Ed to take his leave for the day, the family is confronted with a terrific windstorm.  Connie hurries to the train for shopping in the City. The camera catches the wild abandon of the wind in the city that picks up trash, Macy's parade-type balloons, streamers and tosses them all aloft.  Connie's packages billow around her head, her skirt catches the wind.  She loses control and literally gets blown over, knocking a man down, and scraping her knees.  The two of them try to retrieve the books, packages blowing about, but are defeated.  No, it isn't quite ""destiny;"" Connie realizes in a distant way that this young man spells danger, but she accompanies him to ostensibly get a band aid for her injured knees.Martinez plays Paul as neither good nor bad.  His youth is emphasized along with youth's carelessness and sublime conceit.  Paul is a good-natured intellectual stud with a charming French accent. Connie is frankly getting off on flaunting more and more public sexual displays. She dresses with only an eye for sensuality and ease.  It is inevitable that Ed will discover her adultery.  In ways, Connie wants him to know, to rescue her from herself. I don't think Ed is murderous, just bewildered, but the gesture of a moment locks Ed and Connie into a changed world.""Unfaithful"" has a good pace, beautiful photography and, it goes without saying, a great deal of eroticism.  Overt sexuality usually keeps me away from a film, but Diane Lane transcends misgivings and false sense of propriety.  Her Oscar nomination is well earned.  Richard Gere plays against type in a very restrained role.

The director is Adrian Lyne of ""Fatal Attraction"" and its boiled rabbit fame (or hot sex scenes of one Mickey Rourke film ... remember?), but those who expect ""Unfaithful"" to follow the example of these 80s film would be surprised.  This film, potboiler as it is, is made with more understated hand, focusing the seemingly peaceful relations between the husband and the wife.It is Diane Lane who becomes the driving force of the film.  As Connie, she bumps into one good-looking French guy, second-hand bookdealer Olivier Martinez on the windy street.  She then parts, but later finds herself attracted to him, and goes to his flat while her husband is working outside.  The plot thickens when Connie gets too accustomed to her clandestine relations, which starts to crumble when her husband suspects that there is something going on behind his back.The first part of ""Unfaithful"" is slow-moving, but it is done on purpose (and this is a remake of a French film).  I might be making a mistake, but I didn't find the initial relations between Lane and Martinez very convincing, probably because this French actor (who looks like Tom Cruise with beard) is not ready for the work with the caliber of Lane.  But more to the point; the opening chapters are sustained by the excellent performance of Diane Lane, whose character undergoes thorough transformation.  Just watch her.Gere looks surprisingly ordinary even though we know he was in ""Pretty Woman"" and ""American Gigolo.""  But as is the case with his recent efforts, Richard Gere proves that he is getting better and better every year.  But the real surprise is Diane Lane, who once has to serve thankless roles in forgettable action flicks (behind Wesley Snipes and Sly Stallone).  However, around the time of ""My Dog Skip,"" I began to think that Jodie is not the only one who successfully changes images of former child actor.  Her fans should never miss it.Reflecting Richard Gere's penchant for French films -- he has remade, as far as I know, French ones in ""Breathless,""""Jack Sommersby"" and ""Intersection"" -- ""Unfaithful"" is a character-driven film rather than a melodrama or suspence.  Director Lyne commits some mistakes of inserting too incredible coincidents here and there, but it is those two central characters that we really care.

722455,A5A2QE6NECFR5,B00006RCNY,William E. Adams,"[3, 3]","Good performances all around in this tale of the unintended, catastrophic consequences of cheating on your mate. Diane Lane willingly starts a hot affair with a younger man, seemingly seduced by his French accent and air of intellectualism as much as by his looks. Her marriage to Richard Gere does not seem bad. She is not abused and he is still having sex with her. If he neglects her at all, it is usually to pay more attention to their son. The couple has enough money, and Diane has friends. There seems no real justification for her decision to break her vows. Her lover appears charming at first, but in the week or two of their daily sexual encounters he does a few small, selfish or inappropriate things. Richard Gere is no dummy, and he catches on quickly, partly because Diane gets impatient and careless and leaves him plenty of hints. Whether this is deliberate or not is left to the viewer to decide. What transpires after hubby decides to have a talk with the lover changes every life for the worst. First Diane lies to cover up her afternoon delights, then Richard is the one forced to lie, then Diane realizes what happened between her spouse and her lover. Finally the two of them have to decide what to do next.  The decision, to me, seems clear, but is not actually shown on screen. Diane Lane has a great role here, depicting the guilty enjoyment of her affair, which quickly becomes a daily obsession and leads to her letting her lover get away with cheating of his own. She has intense climaxes, feels guilty afterwards, intends to quit, but returns for more. The film, however, never justifies her choice, to its credit. Richard's role is quite understated, except when circumstances lead him first to panic and then to deceive and finally to confront his wife and his own actions. What Richard does about the affair is also either deliberate or accidental, depending on each viewer's opinion.

722456,A2ASIT0JYIGHTA,B00006RCNY,William,"[2, 3]","To be honest, I thought this would be a very predictable film trying to recreate the magic of &quot;Fatal Attraction&quot;. I was completely wrong. This is a more realistic film (no boiling bunnies) and nothing can quite prepare you for the tragic set of circumstances that unfold.Largely overlooked in Australia with limited cinema release, I took a chance and hired the DVD in December 2002.  At that time, Diane Lane had not been nominated for an Oscar, but I was so impressed with her performance that I wondered at the time if she would get nominated.  Richard Gere is surprisingly good too as the husband.  This is more a supporting role for Richard with Diane taking the lead.  I don't wish to give too much away, but anyone who is thinking of seeing this, but is sceptical - trust me, you will enjoy it.  Just give it a chance to unfold.  Don't let the first 30 or so minutes fool you into thinking it's going to be an easy ride.Great work Diane Lane.
