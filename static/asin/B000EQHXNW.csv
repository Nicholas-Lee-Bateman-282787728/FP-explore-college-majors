Because if you were, you would realize this is an incredibly poor copy of his previous work, Crimes & Misdemeanors, which was in turns funny, thoughtful, suspenseful, etc. Allen's works obviously do repeat many of the same themes, but Match Point is literally more of a derivative work.  Even if this were a new film, it's terribly flawed. The viewer isn't trusted at all to understand the issues of the story, and so themes and images are featured in a highly repetitious manner. (One scene I especially hated was a closeup of a tennis ball straddling the net and eventually tipping to illustrate the theme of chance, which had already come up numerous times...) Disappointing. BTW, the people are better looking than in Crimes, but everyone keeps their clothes ON, so don't get too excited.

From the beginning, British pro-tennis champion, Chris Wilton (Jonathan Rys Meyers), reflects that it is better to be lucky than it is to be good.  As he narrates we see a tennis match going on where only the ball is presented.  The volley goes until the ball hits the net, then the shot is frozen.  Which side will the ball land?  We're not sure.  We have to keep watching.  Not since the orchestra was used at the beginning of Alfred Hitchcock's 'The Man Who Knew Too Much' has a focal point been more effectively presented to start a drama.  'Match Point' is always absorbing and presents its story in a unique way that all but guarantees it will please the audience.Chloe Hewett (Emily Mortimer), the daughter of a wealthy aristocrat, falls in love with Chris, and it is during their dating that he becomes infatuated with his fiance's brother's girlfriend, Nola Rice (Scarlett Johansson), an American actress who has relocated from the States.  His interest becomes an obsession, including all his efforts to make them into a foursome.  Convenient for him, Nola visits the family and becomes available in a blow-out scene from which she flees.  Awkwardly, the two consummate their longings, and from there complications naturally develop because of his two love interests.  He loves his fiance, Chloe, but has a passionate desire for Nola.  Chloe's family provides the trappings of wealth Chris also desires, and it seems all but likely that Tom, his future brother-in-law, will be betrothed to Nola.  Naturally, life doesn't work as planned.  Chris and Chloe get married.  Tom breaks off his relationship with Nola and marries someone else.  In the meantime, Chris does everything to push his employment responsibilities aside and cheat with Nola.  Chloe is obsessed with having children and their ability to conceive creates great tension.  Nola, on the other hand, quickly conceives herself after passion has left them off-guard and without proper prevention.  His decisions to try and have it all with money, lust, and love are the focal point of the rest of the movie.  To elaborate would spoil the fun, and, indeed, there is much to love about the development of this fine movie.'Match Point' has all the greatness of genuine acting and masterful direction.  The details are effective and the relationships unfold in an intriguing fashion.  There is a subjective comparison to make:  Some of the movie reminds one of 'Closer,' but 'Match Point' is so unique that any comparisons to another movie are unfair.  'Match Point' is a superb creation that scores points for expert form and execution.",5,Love-Lust,1159056000,"09 24, 2006",2006,2660,"['Woody', 'Allen', 'Point', 'right', 'moves', 'beginning', 'British', 'pro-tennis', 'champion', 'Chris', 'Wilton', 'Jonathan', 'Rys', 'Meyers', 'better', 'be', 'lucky', 'be', 'good', 'see', 'tennis', 'match', 'going', 'where', 'only', 'ball', 'presented', 'volley', 'ball', 'net', 'then', 'shot', 'frozen', 'Which', 'side', 'will', 'ball', 'land', ""'re"", 'not', 'sure', 'have', 'keep', 'watching', 'Not', 'orchestra', 'was', 'used', 'beginning', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', ""'The"", 'Man', 'Who', 'Knew', 'Too', 'Much', 'focal', 'point', 'been', 'more', 'effectively', 'presented', 'start', 'drama', ""'Match"", 'Point', 'always', 'absorbing', 'story', 'unique', 'way', 'will', 'please', 'audience.Chloe', 'Hewett', 'Emily', 'Mortimer', 'daughter', 'wealthy', 'aristocrat', 'love', 'Chris', 'dating', 'infatuated', 'fiance', 'brother', 'girlfriend', 'Nola', 'Rice', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'American', 'actress', 'who', 'relocated', 'States', 'interest', 'obsession', 'including', 'efforts', 'make', 'foursome', 'Convenient', 'Nola', 'family', 'available', 'blow-out', 'scene', 'Awkwardly', 'two', 'consummate', 'longings', 'complications', 'naturally', 'develop', 'two', 'love', 'interests', 'fiance', 'Chloe', 'passionate', 'desire', 'Nola', 'Chloe', 'family', 'trappings', 'wealth', 'Chris', 'also', 'likely', 'Tom', 'future', 'brother-in-law', 'will', 'be', 'betrothed', 'Nola', 'Naturally', 'life', ""n't"", 'work', 'as', 'planned', 'Chris', 'Chloe', 'get', 'married', 'Tom', 'relationship', 'Nola', 'marries', 'someone', 'else', 'meantime', 'Chris', 'everything', 'push', 'employment', 'responsibilities', 'aside', 'cheat', 'Nola', 'Chloe', 'obsessed', 'having', 'children', 'ability', 'conceive', 'creates', 'great', 'tension', 'Nola', 'other', 'hand', 'quickly', 'passion', 'left', 'off-guard', 'proper', 'prevention', 'decisions', 'try', 'have', 'money', 'lust', 'love', 'are', 'focal', 'point', 'rest', 'movie', 'elaborate', 'would', 'spoil', 'fun', 'indeed', 'much', 'love', 'development', 'fine', 'movie', ""'Match"", 'Point', 'greatness', 'genuine', 'acting', 'masterful', 'direction', 'details', 'are', 'effective', 'relationships', 'unfold', 'intriguing', 'fashion', 'subjective', 'comparison', 'make', 'movie', 'one', ""'Closer"", 'Point', 'so', 'unique', 'comparisons', 'movie', 'are', 'unfair', ""'Match"", 'Point', 'superb', 'creation', 'points', 'expert', 'form', 'execution']",Match Point
977515,A13DD17X1AZFGJ,B000EQHXNW,A. Butterfield,"[16, 22]","This is an odd experience for a British Woody Allen fan: it's set in London and most of the characters are British, but it's not a Britain I know.Granted the characters are part of the landed gentry and a bit posh, but their speech patterns are all wrong. I watched it with a group of friends and we had a good laugh at the unrealistic dialogue that seems to come from Jane Austen's time. Actually it's quite offputting.There are some big question marks about the basic premise: Chris, the lead guy, is supposed to be from Ireland, but has a cut-glass English accent. And he acts like he's never been to London before. Like he's from another planet.The locations are all weird, perhaps partly because of the lack of 'on location' background noise. This is a very quiet London Allen's found. If only it was like that.What all this does is give the movie a very inauthentic feel.It's not helped by the the young lead, whose acting is wooden and unconvincing. It's possible he was floundering with the terrible script, but some of the other actors managed well enough. He though, more than anything else, makes the story hard to believe. You find yourself watching actors instead of getting involved in the story.The bits of opera thrown in at melodramatic moments are rather ridiculous too.But as mentioned, the script is perhaps the worst thing. It really does seem like some terrible Mills and Boon story at times, and you just can't avoid thinking about it, all through the movie.Bravo, I guess, to WA for doing something a little bit different, though as one friend commented, it's really just 'Crimes and Misdemeanors' without the laughs.",2,Bizarre,1147564800,"05 14, 2006",2006,1641,"['odd', 'experience', 'British', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'fan', 'set', 'London', 'most', 'characters', 'are', 'British', 'not', 'Britain', 'know.Granted', 'characters', 'are', 'part', 'landed', 'gentry', 'bit', 'posh', 'speech', 'patterns', 'are', 'wrong', 'watched', 'group', 'friends', 'had', 'good', 'laugh', 'unrealistic', 'dialogue', 'come', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'time', 'Actually', 'quite', 'are', 'big', 'question', 'marks', 'basic', 'premise', 'Chris', 'lead', 'guy', 'supposed', 'be', 'Ireland', 'cut-glass', 'English', 'accent', 'never', 'been', 'London', 'before', 'planet.The', 'locations', 'are', 'weird', 'perhaps', 'partly', 'lack', 'location', 'background', 'noise', 'very', 'quiet', 'London', 'Allen', 'found', 'only', 'was', 'give', 'movie', 'very', 'inauthentic', 'feel.It', 'not', 'helped', 'young', 'lead', 'acting', 'wooden', 'unconvincing', 'possible', 'was', 'floundering', 'terrible', 'script', 'other', 'actors', 'managed', 'well', 'enough', 'more', 'anything', 'else', 'story', 'hard', 'believe', 'find', 'watching', 'actors', 'instead', 'getting', 'involved', 'story.The', 'bits', 'opera', 'thrown', 'melodramatic', 'moments', 'are', 'rather', 'ridiculous', 'too.But', 'mentioned', 'script', 'perhaps', 'worst', 'thing', 'really', 'seem', 'terrible', 'Mills', 'Boon', 'story', 'times', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'avoid', 'thinking', 'movie.Bravo', 'guess', 'WA', 'doing', 'something', 'little', 'bit', 'different', 'though', 'one', 'friend', 'commented', 'really', 'just', ""'Crimes"", 'Misdemeanors', 'laughs']",Match Point
977516,A2EEUQ81DTY7G3,B000EQHXNW,A Customer,"[4, 7]","Woody Allen in his latest movie, the devastatingly entertaining Match Point, he explores the whims of misfortune, the vagaries of right and wrong. The movie is an extraordinarily bleak look at the moral morass of betrayal, illicit sex, hypocrisy, and crime. What a tangled web of secrets and lies that we weave, at least one would think so after watching this beautifully acted movie.Relying on several crucial characters, some great London locations and precise storytelling, without a shot or line of dialogue wasted, Allen has created a perfect chamber piece, an intense and elegant look at sexual infidelity, and the price one ultimately pays for having deceptively good or even bad luck; it's all just a fortuitous role of the dice, the unforeseen luck of the game in Match Point.How much is one willing to give up one's exclusive lifestyle for love? Chris Wilson (a phenomenal Jonathan Rhys-Meyers) is presented this question as he steadily becomes involved with the wealthy Hewett family. Chris has just been offered a job as tennis pro at a prominent English club when he befriends one of his clients, Tom Hewett (Matthew Goode). After a friendly practice session, Tom discovers that Chris is an opera lover and is invited to share an evening out with his rich family.Chris soon charms Tom's mother Eleanor (Penelope Wilton), his father Alec (Brian Cox) and sister Chloe (Emily Mortimer) and after obtaining a job in Alec's company, steadily becomes accustomed to his newfound life of privilege. The lovely and sweet Chloe makes it known that she's rather enamored of Chris and they soon embark on a romantic relationship.But Chris is almost instantaneously attracted to Tom's sexy American girlfriend Nola Rice (Scarlett Johansson). Chris soon becomes infatuated with Nola and, despite continuing his relationship with Chloe, eventually persuades her to sleep with him. Nola initially scoffs at his later advances, and later she breaks up with Tom and also leaves London, but a chance meeting a few years later with Chris re-ignites the same old passions.Chris is now forced to carry on a clandestine affair with Nola, to juggle the demands of his high-powered job and also continue in his duties to the Hewett family. He cares for his wife and enjoys the lifestyle the family affords him, but Chloe is constantly on at him to get her pregnant, yet he really does love Nola. Circumstances ultimately force him to make a difficult choice between maintaining his financial security and giving it all up for true love.While this story isn't anything new - the tribulations of infidelity have been told time and again in various forms - what makes Match Point so great is Allen's tightly focused direction. The dialogue is sharp and witty, the story is very well laid out and planned, and builds very slowly, keeping the viewer guessing, so one never really knows where the story is heading.Kudos should also go to Allen that he can imbue such finely wrought performances out his sexy ensemble of young actors. Rhys-Meyers and Johansson play Chris and Nola as somewhat downtrodden by their adopted upper-class family. Both are kindred spirits from the wrong side of the tracks, and while Chris unhesitatingly buys into the wealth and prestige, Nola is somewhat cynical and diffident towards Hewett family.Scarlet Johansson gives a fiercely sexy, dynamic, and feverishly sensual performance as Nola. Provocative, saucy, edgy, and vulnerable, she's a mass of conflicting emotions. She's hesitant to become involved with Chris again, but when she does, she throws care to the wind, and becomes a desperate, needy and chaotic emotional mess.Emily Mortimer is also terrific Chloe. Given perhaps the harder role to play, Ms. Mortimer imbues Chloe with a whiney sweetness. Chloe is obviously a product of her class; she's good-natured, and kindly but also a bit snottish. She's pleased to fall in love with a man not of her class and thinks herself blessed by his ostensible affection.But Match Point ultimately belongs to Jonathan Rhys-Meyers who is a revelation as Chris. As the loving son in-law and the dutiful husband, Meyers infuses Chris with a serene fa?ade, but there's always an abundance of cunning desires. He's the working class outsider who will resort to any lengths to fit in, but his persistently good nature holds a passive aggressive streak that is ultimately deceptive.Match Point is suffused with a glow of bittersweet romance and ruefulness among the elite, English upper class, and Allen has more than nailed their grandiloquence and aristocratic pretensions. Maybe that explains why Allen's work as writer and director seems here to be more engaged and energetic than it has in years.

I don't quite understand all this talk of ""Match Point"" being considered Woody Allen's ""comeback"". Woody Allen never went away. I, in complete contradiction to the American public, have actually found that I have enjoyed Allen's recent efforts. I like ""Melinda and Melinda"", ""Anything Else"", and ""Small Time Crooks"". I've enjoyed all of Allen's films to various degrees. So, while I'm glad the public and the critics are finally starting to wake up and appreciate Allen's latest film, to me it is not a ""comeback"".""Match Point"", as has been so aptly pointed out by critics and the lucky few whom have managed to see advance screening has a completely different look from Allen's previous films, but this different look is only because Allen has shot this movie in London instead of his beloved New York, but everything else about this picture is pure Woody Allen. We are dealing with the same themes, we are getting the same view of middle to upper class society, and the same bits of dialogue as characters enjoy the high arts and quote literature to one another. And I'm not saying this as a fault. I'm glad the movie isn't as different as some people are letting on. I did after all pay to see a ""Woody Allen picture"".What makes ""Match Point"" though different from previous Allen films is first of all this one is a pure drama, not a half drama like ""Melinda and Melinda"". And it's also not a Bergmanesque drama in the tradition of ""Interiors"" or ""September"". It resembles, if anything, ""Crimes and Misdemeanors"".But there is more to the movie than strictly the drama. To my surprise Allen showcases a great ability at being able to create suspense. And I mean he does it really well. We're talking about Hitchcock level here.As far as the plot goes, I'm sorry but I can't tell you anything major. I walked into the movie cold. I went out of my way to avoid hearing anything about the movie. For a Woody Allen film there was certainly a lot of buzz floating around the picture. And I want your experience to be the same as mine. To discover the plot secrets right there in the theater was amazing. Had I known everything in advance the effect of the movie may very well have been different.""Match Point"" stars Jonathan Rhys Meyers as a former tennis pro, Chris Wilton, who is now reduced to teaching instead of playing. But all is well, or least it will be. Chris meets Tom Hewett (Matthew Goode) who he gives lessons to. The two instantly hit it off and become good friends, they both even share a love of opera. It is when Chris is invited to attend with Tom he meets Chloe (Emily Mortimer), Tom's sister. Chloe also takes an instant liking to Chris and soon things get complicated and my description of the movie will have to stop there.The two best performances in the movie I feel belong to Mortimer and Scarlett Johansson, who has already received a Golden Globe nomination for her performance. Hopefully both ladies will receive Oscar nominations for Best Supporting Actress. But between the two I must admit I do prefer Mortimer. It also helps she is given more screen time so we have more opportunities to care about her character.Now is ""Match Point"" really Allen's best film in a decade as some critics are saying? Probably. But isn't it odd for us to say Allen's best movie is a drama? Here is a man whom we usually identify with comedies. But ""Match Point"" is a movie that will not have cross over appeal. I have said it before and I will say it again, Woody Allen will no longer make any new fans. People who say they don't like him simply don't like him and will never give any of his films a chance, they simply walk in with a bad attitude, so no matter how good the movie may be they will always be disappointed. For the rest of us though ""Match Point"" is one of Allen's bravest films to date and one of 2005's best films.Bottom-line: Woody Allen's most complex, daring films in years. One of the year's best.",5,Pure Luck,1136505600,"01 6, 2006",2006,3978,"['First', 'want', 'offer', 'something', 'disclosure', 'do', ""n't"", 'quite', 'understand', 'talk', 'Match', 'Point', 'being', 'considered', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'comeback', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'never', 'went', 'away', 'complete', 'contradiction', 'American', 'public', 'have', 'actually', 'found', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'Allen', 'recent', 'efforts', 'Melinda', 'Melinda', 'Anything', 'Else', 'Small', 'Time', 'Crooks', ""'ve"", 'enjoyed', 'Allen', 'films', 'various', 'degrees', 'So', ""'m"", 'glad', 'public', 'critics', 'are', 'finally', 'starting', 'wake', 'up', 'appreciate', 'Allen', 'latest', 'film', 'not', 'comeback', 'Match', 'Point', 'been', 'so', 'aptly', 'pointed', 'out', 'critics', 'lucky', 'few', 'whom', 'have', 'managed', 'see', 'advance', 'screening', 'completely', 'different', 'look', 'Allen', 'previous', 'films', 'different', 'look', 'only', 'Allen', 'shot', 'movie', 'London', 'instead', 'beloved', 'New', 'York', 'everything', 'else', 'picture', 'pure', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'are', 'dealing', 'same', 'themes', 'are', 'getting', 'same', 'view', 'middle', 'upper', 'class', 'society', 'same', 'bits', 'dialogue', 'characters', 'enjoy', 'high', 'arts', 'quote', 'literature', 'one', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'fault', ""'m"", 'glad', 'movie', ""n't"", 'as', 'different', 'people', 'are', 'letting', 'did', 'pay', 'see', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'picture', 'Match', 'Point', 'different', 'previous', 'Allen', 'films', 'first', 'one', 'pure', 'drama', 'not', 'half', 'drama', 'Melinda', 'Melinda', 'also', 'not', 'Bergmanesque', 'drama', 'tradition', 'Interiors', 'September', 'anything', 'Crimes', 'Misdemeanors', '.But', 'more', 'movie', 'strictly', 'drama', 'surprise', 'Allen', 'great', 'ability', 'being', 'able', 'create', 'suspense', 'mean', 'really', 'well', ""'re"", 'talking', 'Hitchcock', 'level', 'here.As', 'far', 'plot', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'anything', 'major', 'walked', 'movie', 'cold', 'went', 'way', 'avoid', 'hearing', 'anything', 'movie', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'film', 'was', 'certainly', 'lot', 'buzz', 'floating', 'picture', 'want', 'experience', 'be', 'same', 'mine', 'discover', 'plot', 'secrets', 'right', 'there', 'theater', 'was', 'amazing', 'Had', 'known', 'everything', 'advance', 'effect', 'movie', 'may', 'very', 'well', 'have', 'been', 'different', 'Match', 'Point', 'stars', 'Jonathan', 'Rhys', 'Meyers', 'former', 'tennis', 'pro', 'Chris', 'Wilton', 'who', 'now', 'reduced', 'teaching', 'instead', 'playing', 'well', 'least', 'will', 'be', 'Chris', 'Tom', 'Hewett', 'Matthew', 'Goode', 'who', 'lessons', 'two', 'instantly', 'hit', 'off', 'become', 'good', 'friends', 'even', 'share', 'love', 'opera', 'when', 'Chris', 'invited', 'attend', 'Tom', 'Chloe', 'Emily', 'Mortimer', 'Tom', 'sister', 'Chloe', 'also', 'instant', 'liking', 'Chris', 'soon', 'things', 'get', 'complicated', 'description', 'movie', 'will', 'have', 'stop', 'there.The', 'two', 'best', 'performances', 'movie', 'feel', 'belong', 'Mortimer', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'who', 'already', 'received', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'nomination', 'performance', 'Hopefully', 'ladies', 'will', 'receive', 'Oscar', 'nominations', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actress', 'two', 'must', 'admit', 'do', 'prefer', 'Mortimer', 'also', 'given', 'more', 'screen', 'time', 'have', 'more', 'opportunities', 'care', 'character.Now', 'Match', 'Point', 'really', 'Allen', 'best', 'film', 'decade', 'critics', 'are', 'saying', 'Probably', ""n't"", 'odd', 'say', 'Allen', 'best', 'movie', 'drama', 'Here', 'man', 'whom', 'usually', 'identify', 'comedies', 'Match', 'Point', 'movie', 'will', 'not', 'have', 'cross', 'appeal', 'have', 'said', 'will', 'say', 'again', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'will', 'no', 'longer', 'make', 'new', 'fans', 'People', 'who', 'say', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'simply', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'will', 'never', 'give', 'films', 'chance', 'simply', 'walk', 'bad', 'attitude', 'matter', 'how', 'good', 'movie', 'may', 'be', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'disappointed', 'rest', 'Match', 'Point', 'one', 'Allen', 'bravest', 'films', 'date', 'one', '2005', 'best', 'films.Bottom-line', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'most', 'complex', 'daring', 'films', 'years', 'One', 'year', 'best']",Match Point

(The most egregious example is Tom, played by Matthew Goode, who speaks like a contestant in the Monty Python Upper Class Twit of the Year Contest.)Glossy and superficial, the movie resembles a collection of Architectural Digest photographs populated by Calvin Klein models.  London has never looked lovelier, but after careful scrutiny, MP delivers less than meets the eye.This is not a typical Allen film, there's no small circle of hopelessly neurotic, narcissistic intellectuals swapping snappy patter and falling in and out of bed.  Nor is it funny.  The first two thirds consist of a brutally slow boy meets girl, boy marries nice girl, boy has affair with not nice girl, boy in terrible jam story.  The acting is good, Chris, Jonathan Rhys Meyers, projects the requisite moral emptiness and cowardice.Scarlett Johansson, Nola, brings Body by Fisher appeal to the tale, but is so maddeningly wrong that viewers will want to slap Chris in the face with a large fish.  When Chris marries Chloe, we know long before any of the characters do that she is selling herself cheap.  Chloe is played by the enchanting Emily Mortimer, (unforgettable in Dear Frankie).  She is so unequivocally kind and good that watching Chris abuse her is especially painful and, in an odd and gloomy way, somehow inevitable.Act three finds the picture completely changing gears as it attempts to hook viewers with a murder mystery.  While there is a murder, the only mystery in this picture is why Allen felt compelled to make it.  Critics will compare it to Crimes And Misdemeanors, but it's not nearly that good.

It's a slice-of-life film full of fine observation and good under-stated acting and direction that is spot-on. At no time does the director intrude into the storyline; everything is focused on the protagonists and there's no superfluous ""hey, look at this camera shot, look at this use of color, look at this clever trope"" anywhere. Allen is to be congratulated on a very fine piece of work. Some reviewers have commented that the middle of the film is somewhat slow, but personally I found the entire thing to be perfectly paced and judged, each element setting up the next in careful succession. The last fifteen minutes, with the ""will he be found out?"" theme, was perhaps a little less than this film deserved, but it's the only slight flaw in an otherwise outstanding story.

977527,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B000EQHXNW,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 3]","Being known as Woody Allen's comeback film is not an easy title to carry, but `Match Point' lives up to its title every second of screen time.  It's sexy and tense, expertly paced and tightly scripted.  `Match Point' is, for lack of a better word, perfect.  The film flows so evenly and keeps your interest throughout, and actually is able to catch the viewer off guard in the final act of the film by expertly crafting a script that disguises itself very well.  That's not to say that the film isn't mysterious from the very beginning; it's dark and ominous in a very discreet and subtle way.  The chemistry between the entire cast is rock solid as well, from Jonathon Rhys Meyers to the every scrumptious Scarlett Johansson, and adds layer upon layer to the understanding and ultimate climax of the film.The story follows Chris Wilton, played by Rhys Meyers, who marries into wealth when he finds the beautiful Chloe Hewett, played by Emily Mortimer.  Everything seems to be going well for Chris, a former tennis pro turned business man by his new father in law.  He has a beautiful apartment, a beautiful wife and a well paying job, and then walks in Nola Rice, fianc&eacute;e to Chloe's brother Tom.  Nola is sexy, she's confident and she's everything Chris has ever wanted in a woman, but she's taken, and so is he.  Slowly though the two of them begin to test the waters of chastity and fidelity, and then when Nola is dumped by Tom she becomes fair game for Chris and the two fall deep into a passion they've never experienced before.Problems arise though when Nola decides she's tired of being the `other woman'.  She's convinced that Chris loves her and not his wife and is determined to have Chris all to herself.  Chris is plagued with decision.  Should he leave his wife and his easy life, all his newfound wealth for a woman who can only offer him passion?  Should he stay with his wife and forsake his heart's desire?  If he stays with his wife how can he convince Nola to stay quiet or, better yet, go away?  The film takes a twist I personally didn't see coming and leaves you somewhat breathless in its raw delivery.The acting here is superb.  Scarlett Johansson is a scene stealer as the delicious Nola Rice.  She's very aware of her sexuality and uses it as a weapon against Chris but more importantly against the audience.  Johansson was the perfect choice for the other woman because it's very believable that any man would be drawn to her regardless of the life they are leading.  Jonathon Rhys Meyers is also excellent in this film.  His performance is very detailed.  You can read the constant uneasiness in his face, the constant overwhelming concern about his actions.  Emily Mortimer is also fantastic, albeit very sorely underused.  Her few key scenes are effective, but she's not given enough of a chance to develop her character.  Woody Allen also directs this masterpiece so evenly.  His script is tight, his editing is fantastic and the finished product is one to watch again and again.  And have I mentioned that London, being the backdrop, is effortlessly captivating and a perfect mood setter!If a well paced and thought provoking thriller is what you're looking for then `Match Point' may just be the film you need to see.  It'll keep you at the edge of your seat throughout and is sure to please anyone in your company.  It's edgy, it's sexy and it's intense.  I still don't quite understand the rating though.  The film is PG-13 at best.  The sexuality is mild, nothing you couldn't watch on television, and the violence is mostly off camera.  `Match Point' delivers scene after scene and remains one of my favorite films of 2005, one of the most surprising, the most entertaining and the most rewatchable films in recent years.",5,"True masterpiece of a thriller, it's sexy, edgy and tense...",1184112000,"07 11, 2007",2007,3766,"['Being', 'known', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'comeback', 'film', 'not', 'easy', 'title', 'carry', 'Match', 'Point', 'up', 'title', 'second', 'screen', 'time', 'sexy', 'tense', 'expertly', 'paced', 'tightly', 'scripted', 'Match', 'Point', 'lack', 'better', 'word', 'perfect', 'film', 'so', 'evenly', 'keeps', 'interest', 'actually', 'able', 'catch', 'viewer', 'off', 'guard', 'final', 'act', 'film', 'expertly', 'crafting', 'script', 'very', 'well', 'not', 'say', 'film', ""n't"", 'mysterious', 'very', 'beginning', 'dark', 'ominous', 'very', 'discreet', 'subtle', 'way', 'chemistry', 'entire', 'cast', 'rock', 'solid', 'as', 'well', 'Jonathon', 'Rhys', 'Meyers', 'scrumptious', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'layer', 'layer', 'understanding', 'ultimate', 'climax', 'film.The', 'story', 'Chris', 'Wilton', 'played', 'Rhys', 'Meyers', 'who', 'wealth', 'when', 'beautiful', 'Chloe', 'Hewett', 'played', 'Emily', 'Mortimer', 'Everything', 'be', 'going', 'well', 'Chris', 'former', 'tennis', 'pro', 'turned', 'business', 'man', 'new', 'father', 'law', 'beautiful', 'apartment', 'beautiful', 'wife', 'well', 'paying', 'job', 'then', 'walks', 'Nola', 'Rice', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'Chloe', 'brother', 'Tom', 'Nola', 'sexy', 'confident', 'everything', 'Chris', 'ever', 'wanted', 'woman', 'taken', 'so', 'Slowly', 'two', 'begin', 'test', 'waters', 'chastity', 'fidelity', 'then', 'when', 'Nola', 'dumped', 'Tom', 'fair', 'game', 'Chris', 'two', 'fall', 'deep', 'passion', ""'ve"", 'never', 'experienced', 'before.Problems', 'arise', 'when', 'Nola', 'tired', 'being', 'other', 'woman', 'convinced', 'Chris', 'not', 'wife', 'determined', 'have', 'Chris', 'Chris', 'plagued', 'decision', 'Should', 'leave', 'wife', 'easy', 'life', 'newfound', 'wealth', 'woman', 'who', 'can', 'only', 'offer', 'passion', 'Should', 'stay', 'wife', 'forsake', 'heart', 'desire', 'wife', 'how', 'can', 'convince', 'Nola', 'stay', 'quiet', 'better', 'yet', 'go', 'away', 'film', 'twist', 'personally', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'coming', 'somewhat', 'breathless', 'raw', 'delivery.The', 'acting', 'here', 'superb', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'scene', 'stealer', 'delicious', 'Nola', 'Rice', 'very', 'aware', 'sexuality', 'weapon', 'Chris', 'more', 'importantly', 'audience', 'Johansson', 'was', 'perfect', 'choice', 'other', 'woman', 'very', 'believable', 'man', 'would', 'be', 'drawn', 'regardless', 'life', 'are', 'leading', 'Jonathon', 'Rhys', 'Meyers', 'also', 'excellent', 'film', 'performance', 'very', 'detailed', 'can', 'read', 'constant', 'uneasiness', 'face', 'constant', 'overwhelming', 'concern', 'actions', 'Emily', 'Mortimer', 'also', 'fantastic', 'albeit', 'very', 'sorely', 'underused', 'few', 'key', 'scenes', 'are', 'effective', 'not', 'given', 'enough', 'chance', 'develop', 'character', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'also', 'masterpiece', 'so', 'evenly', 'script', 'tight', 'editing', 'fantastic', 'finished', 'product', 'one', 'watch', 'again', 'again', 'have', 'mentioned', 'London', 'being', 'backdrop', 'effortlessly', 'captivating', 'perfect', 'mood', 'setter', 'well', 'paced', 'thought', 'provoking', 'thriller', 'what', ""'re"", 'looking', 'then', 'Match', 'Point', 'may', 'just', 'be', 'film', 'need', 'see', ""'ll"", 'keep', 'edge', 'seat', 'sure', 'please', 'anyone', 'company', 'edgy', 'sexy', 'intense', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'quite', 'understand', 'rating', 'film', 'PG-13', 'best', 'sexuality', 'mild', 'nothing', 'could', ""n't"", 'watch', 'television', 'violence', 'mostly', 'camera', 'Match', 'Point', 'delivers', 'scene', 'scene', 'one', 'favorite', 'films', '2005', 'one', 'most', 'surprising', 'most', 'entertaining', 'most', 'rewatchable', 'films', 'recent', 'years']",Match Point
977528,A2YRKEKFPX2BH4,B000EQHXNW,Andrew,"[3, 6]","As already said, this follows the story of a young tennis pro turned upper class leech.  The story flows slowly, but is thoroughly engrossing.  The performances are great- (except I think Johansson's performance is hampered by poor writing, relying too much on her beauty and her being American, her character is soundly flat) - the rich mother is a baiting harpy - Brian Cox is great, as usual, as the benevolent patriarch- the rich children are boring and shallow (though the son has the most important lines- eg. the discussion in the bar about hard work vs. his comments at the end about what he wants for his nephew- trying to be vague!) - and, despite a genuine charm and appeal, you never fully understand the main character's sincerity and motivation - which allows the movie to maintain an ambiguous tone.The morally ambiguous tone is what really makes the movie interesting and worth a renting- you may be surprised by its thoughtfulness.  As they make FAR TOO obvious, the movie is a modern interpretation/manipulation/rewrite of Crime and Punishment (great book!).  Instead of following Dostoyevsky's theme of morality (sorry to simplify a great book!), it follows the theme of chance- not just in how it affects our 'success', but also how it affects our moral make-up.  What I found interesting is that the movie is a sort of reverse Crime and Punishment, but a reverse of someone who would read the book as though it was a precursor to Horatio Algers ideology (luck vs. hard work).

I have never seen Annie Hall or Everything You Ever Wanted To Know About Sex (But Was Afraid To Ask), but I hear that they are amazing.  After seeing Match Point, which many critics consider to be Allen's return to grace, I now want to see his older films, because if they are half as good as this, then they'll be amazing.Chris Wilton (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers) is an Irish tennis pro at a London country club.  While he was once on the pro tour, he left because he felt that he didn't have the skill or the luck.  You see, Wilton firmly believes in luck, and the opening narration, involving a tennis ball hitting the net, is a very powerful theme throughout the film.  Wilton states that when the ball hits the net during a match, there is a split second when it bounces up.  The ball can either bounce forward into the opponent's court and give you the point, or bounce back, causing you to lose.Chris begins teaching a wealthy client named Thomas Hewitt (Matthew Goode), and the pair quickly become friends.  Chris is introduced to the Hewitt family; father Alec (Brian Cox), mother Eleanor (Penelope Wilton), and sister Chloe (Emily Mortimer).  The Hewitts seem to have everything Chris never had when he was growing up; Chris came from a poorer family, and the Hewitts have everything.  Soon, Chloe and Chris start a relationship, and Chris starts to experience how the upper class lives.  Chloe's family like Chris a lot, and Alec comments on his pride that Chris was able to rise up the social ladder on his own merits throughout life.However, his world is thrown for a loop when he meets Nola Rice (Scarlett Johannson), an American actress who is engaged to Tom.  She is a bit of a seductress, and she knows it.  Chris is drawn to Nola, and, due to some outside circumstances involving Eleanor, the two begin an affair.  Things only get worse when Chris and Chloe get married, and, soon after, Tom breaks it off with Nola.  What follows is an interesting look at affairs, and the things Chris will do to keep both women.Chris loves Chloe and he doesn't want to hurt her feelings, but he needs Nola in his life.  He goes to great lengths in order to rekindle their affair.  However, it isn't just Chloe that is keeping him in the marriage.  He claims to have gotten bored with her, and her desire for a child makes him uneasy.  However, Alec got him a job in one of his companies, and now Chris is used to living a certain way.  He has a beautiful apartment overlooking the Thames, as well as every luxury he could wish for.  Meanwhile, Nola is living in a poor neighborhood, and her desire to have the life that Tom could have provided for her begins to make her dependent on Chris as opposed to the other way around.The movie is very darkly comedic, and all the little nuances work very well.  Even when things get very dark towards the end, the humor is still present.  The cast does a great job in all of their roles, convincingly portraying the emotions people go through in the situations that they run in to.Furthermore, the soundtrack is both appropriate and distinctive.  The only music used is opera, and as the tension mounts throughout the film, the music gets more and more dramatic.This film is a great way to start off 2006, and should be a must-see.",5,Woody Allen's Latest Proves To Be A Smash,1137801600,"01 21, 2006",2006,3404,"['have', 'not', 'seen', 'too', 'many', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'movies', 'have', 'seen', 'have', 'been', 'fairly', 'recent', 'fairly', 'poor', 'Small', 'Time', 'Crooks', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'Annie', 'Hall', 'Everything', 'Ever', 'Wanted', 'Know', 'Sex', 'Was', 'Afraid', 'Ask', 'hear', 'are', 'amazing', 'seeing', 'Match', 'Point', 'many', 'critics', 'consider', 'be', 'Allen', 'return', 'grace', 'now', 'want', 'see', 'older', 'films', 'are', 'half', 'as', 'good', 'then', ""'ll"", 'be', 'amazing.Chris', 'Wilton', 'Jonathan', 'Rhys-Meyers', 'Irish', 'tennis', 'pro', 'London', 'country', 'club', 'was', 'once', 'pro', 'tour', 'left', 'felt', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'skill', 'luck', 'see', 'Wilton', 'luck', 'opening', 'narration', 'involving', 'tennis', 'ball', 'hitting', 'net', 'very', 'powerful', 'theme', 'film', 'Wilton', 'when', 'ball', 'net', 'match', 'split', 'second', 'when', 'up', 'ball', 'can', 'either', 'bounce', 'forward', 'opponent', 'court', 'give', 'point', 'bounce', 'back', 'causing', 'lose.Chris', 'begins', 'teaching', 'wealthy', 'client', 'named', 'Thomas', 'Hewitt', 'Matthew', 'Goode', 'pair', 'quickly', 'become', 'friends', 'Chris', 'introduced', 'Hewitt', 'family', 'Alec', 'Brian', 'Cox', 'mother', 'Eleanor', 'Penelope', 'Wilton', 'sister', 'Chloe', 'Emily', 'Mortimer', 'Hewitts', 'seem', 'have', 'everything', 'Chris', 'never', 'had', 'when', 'was', 'growing', 'up', 'Chris', 'came', 'poorer', 'family', 'Hewitts', 'have', 'everything', 'Soon', 'Chloe', 'Chris', 'start', 'relationship', 'Chris', 'experience', 'how', 'upper', 'class', 'lives', 'Chloe', 'family', 'Chris', 'lot', 'Alec', 'comments', 'pride', 'Chris', 'was', 'able', 'rise', 'up', 'social', 'ladder', 'own', 'merits', 'life.However', 'world', 'thrown', 'loop', 'when', 'Nola', 'Rice', 'Scarlett', 'Johannson', 'American', 'actress', 'who', 'engaged', 'Tom', 'bit', 'seductress', 'Chris', 'drawn', 'Nola', 'due', 'outside', 'circumstances', 'involving', 'Eleanor', 'two', 'begin', 'affair', 'only', 'get', 'worse', 'when', 'Chris', 'Chloe', 'get', 'married', 'soon', 'Tom', 'off', 'Nola', 'What', 'interesting', 'look', 'affairs', 'things', 'Chris', 'will', 'do', 'keep', 'women.Chris', 'loves', 'Chloe', ""n't"", 'want', 'hurt', 'feelings', 'Nola', 'life', 'great', 'lengths', 'order', 'rekindle', 'affair', 'However', ""n't"", 'just', 'Chloe', 'keeping', 'marriage', 'have', 'gotten', 'bored', 'desire', 'child', 'uneasy', 'However', 'Alec', 'got', 'job', 'one', 'companies', 'now', 'Chris', 'used', 'living', 'certain', 'way', 'beautiful', 'apartment', 'overlooking', 'Thames', 'as', 'well', 'luxury', 'could', 'wish', 'Meanwhile', 'Nola', 'living', 'poor', 'neighborhood', 'desire', 'have', 'life', 'Tom', 'could', 'have', 'provided', 'begins', 'make', 'dependent', 'Chris', 'opposed', 'other', 'way', 'around.The', 'movie', 'very', 'darkly', 'comedic', 'little', 'nuances', 'work', 'very', 'well', 'Even', 'when', 'things', 'get', 'very', 'dark', 'end', 'humor', 'still', 'present', 'cast', 'great', 'job', 'roles', 'convincingly', 'portraying', 'emotions', 'people', 'go', 'situations', 'run', 'to.Furthermore', 'soundtrack', 'appropriate', 'distinctive', 'only', 'music', 'used', 'opera', 'tension', 'mounts', 'film', 'music', 'more', 'more', 'dramatic.This', 'film', 'great', 'way', 'start', '2006', 'should', 'be', 'must-see']",Match Point

The movie flat-out does not compare in any way to the glowing reviews you've seen thrown around.  To the contrary, it was an excruciating viewing experience.  The few viewers here on these pages with the guts to call it out have it right: this is soap-opera quality stuff with appalling bad and stilted dialogue.  Plus, Allen needs an editor to push back on him: the movie is overly-long by at least 20 minutes.  My wife and I were inventing reasons to leave the room (must brush teeth; do plants need watering?) only to come back five minutes later and find nothing meaningful had transpired.Plus, I'm in agreement with the reviewer here who picks up on the unreasonability of the film's overlauded ""non-Hollywood ending"":  the police run an investigation and don't bother talking to Nola's co-worker?  We see a critical small scene where Nola indicates she's meeting with Chris that night.  Let's review: it's obvious from that quick scene that the romance with Chris is a recurring topic; the scene establishes that the co-worker knows there's a meeting that evening; and the investigators are savvy enough to have found and mined Nola's diary.

It doesn't scream Woody Allen, yet perhaps for that reason, is one of the best from his serious genre.Jonathan Rhys Meyers is the perfect lead, dark and brooding, and very believable as Chris Wilton, the Irish tennis player who ingratiates himself into an upper crust English family. Likewise, Emily Mortimer hits all the right notes to come across as the family's sweet and pampered daughter Chloe who is instantly attracted to him and opens up a life of wealth and privilege he has only dreamed about.  Although Chris finds Chloe ""sweet"" it is Nola, as portrayed by a sultry and seductive Scarlett Johansson, that arouses his passions.  The fly in the ointment is that Nola is engaged to Chloe's brother Tom, as portrayed by Matthew Goode.  Of course, passion wins out and overcomes reason, morals, and good judgment.Rhys Meyers gives the perfect angst-ridden performance as he desperately tries to cover up the affair and is at his peak as the movie's chilling tragedy plays out.  Because the characters are portrayed so perfectly by all the actors, the viewer cannot help but be drawn to them and caught up in their sordid story.When the movie ended, no one in the theater rushed out, but sat momentarily stunned and eager to discuss with fellow moviegoers.

It is dull and there doesn't seem to be any meaning at all, or reason. It's hard to care about any of the characters.

Well, that is the central theme of the movie.Humans by nature, have aspirations to lift themselves and their lifestyles above what they grew up in. Some do it through hardwork while others seek easier means. In a more family oriented society, marrying into a higher strata of society (while not always acceptable) is a means of doing that.More often than not we learn from our mistakes but for that we need that element of luck which will let our mistakes slide. That forms a core element in this movie.This is not a movie where the Woody Allen style is splashed across the pages. His style is content being the subtext to the story.Jonathan Rhys-Meyers steals the show with his beautifully understated performance. The zealousness to rise in life couples with a deep sense of vulnerabilty to make the character of Chris Wilton truly memorable.Same is true for Scarlett Johnansson. The seductiveness is just a cloak over the inner struggles of a girl trying to build a career and find love.

For longtime fans, this may be a welcome change-up, as they may have grown justifiably tired of Allen's recent subpar performances on his home court of Manhattan. (Oops, mixed sports metaphor there!)There are two other things about MATCH POINT that are worth noting:1. Hang in there. After 90 minutes, I was starting to lose my patience with the movie a bit. It is a beautiful-looking film, and the cast is excellent (including lead Scarlett Johansson who plays a part originally intended for Kate Winslet), but the story is neither comedy nor suspenseful drama. In fact , if one were to read the script of this portion of the film, it would come across as mildly interesting and utterly unremarkable.2. At the 90 minute mark, the film turns into a thriller.

977541,A20IIR0422G3A5,B000EQHXNW,"B. Marold ""Bruce W. Marold""","[4, 7]","`Match Point', written and directed by Woody Allen, is like a long drink of cool water for devoted Woody Allen fans, as it is easily his best movie since `Crimes and Misdemeanors', to which it has many similarities.As many earlier reviewers have said, the film breaks with many Allen traditions, as it is filmed entirely in London and environs and it has none of Allen's usual cast of actors. It also has virtually no jokes, and yet it is not as stiff and solemn as his first `serious' movie, `Interiors'. And yet, someone familiar with Allen's complete body of work will be able to see glimpses of his recurring themes lightly sprinkled here and there throughout the movie.The most pervasive themes are guilt, lust, and luck. One may almost go so far as to say that this story is an homage to the great Russian novelist, Dosteyevsky and his novel, `Crime and Punishment', as the main character, Chris, is seen reading this novel at the beginning of the film, and Dosteyevsky is mentioned near the close of the movie. Lust and its consequences are themes in virtually every Allen movie, and he has attacked the subject from just about every angle. It is the main theme in all his best movies such as `Annie Hall', `Hannah and Her Sisters', `Crimes and Misdemeanors', `Manhattan', and `Husbands and Wives. Luck, written large in the form of the caprice of a cosmically indifferent physics and its inherent chance may not be a subject of many of Allen's movies, but it is often tied in with one of his favorite subjects, dispair and lack of faith.Several of Allen's minor themes also pop up here and there, such as scenes taking place in and at the entrance to theaters and scenes taking place while there is action on the screen or stage in the background. In this case, it isn't `Casablanca' or some fictional `Purple Rose of Cairo', but some major live operatic scenes. Classic opera also forms the musical backdrop to all the action. And, except for the `Desdemona' aria from Verdi's `Othello', the appropriateness of the operatic backdrops escapes me, largely due to my paltry knowledge of the operatic canon. My only other observation about them is that Allen seems to have gone out of his way to pick scratchy recordings, probably from old vinyl records. I also have to believe that Allen has a special affinity to tennis, as the game and the tennis court appears at an important point in Allen's most important earlier movie, `Annie Hall'. In this movie, tennis is important mostly as an illustration of the capriciousness on chance and how, at the very end, a small twist of fate, not unlike the fall of a tennis ball poised above the net can make the difference between a loss and `match point'.Unlike virtually every other Allen movie I have seen (and I have seen every one!), this story is played entirely straight from first scene to last. I think there are even more pieces of humor in the average `Law and Order' or `CSI' episode than there is in this film. This is important because it doesn't detract in any way from the real matter at hand, the attraction between the two primary characters played by Jonathan Rhys-Meyers (Chris) and Scarlett Johansson (Nola), in spite of Rhys-Meyers' engagement and marriage to the Chloe, the character played by Emily Mortimer.One thing you see in this movie which I have always respected in Allen's films is that the main characters are COMPETANT. We are generally not dealing with characticures of weak characters here. Even Allen's own nebbish character in many of his movies is generally a successful comedian, writer, or even detective (`Curse of the Jade Scorpion'). Poor son-in-law Chris is played as a genuinely talented up and comer, who fulfills his promise when given a convenient mid-level position in pappa-in-law's company. And, Chris' wealthy inlaws, played by Brian Cox and Penelope Wilton are played straight as an arrow, being totally devoted to the happiness of their daughter and her husband. The most important relationship between Chris and Nola is an expansion of the adulterous relation which dominates the `Crimes' half of `Crimes and Misdemeanors'. As this story takes center stage, it is much better developed here, and Johansson does at least as well as the older Angelica Houston does in `Crimes...'. The only problem, if any, is that Rhys-Meyers is just not quite as effective at playing out the guilt theme as the much older veteran actor, Martin Landau.The only other problem I had with the acting and the story was that the Cloe character, as played by Emily Mortimer seemed simply too oblivious to her husband's lack of interest. She caught on too late and believed Chris' protestations of innocence all to readily.The ending, I believe, depends on just a little suspension of disbelief. If one were to believe modern TV cop shows, the detectives are all bulldogs who rarely shrug off a lead. And, I suspect the fictional offspring of Inspector Lestrade are just a tad too willing to believe the story of a wealthy family scion, given a convincing, albeit thin circumstance leading the police to a different, totally unconnected perp. But, it all works, and works well. While it may not be as strong a performance (given the absence of a lead such as Bill Murray) as in `Lost in Translation', Johansson's performance is worth the price of admission and all other actors carry their roles very, very well.And, London fills in for Allen at least as well as his favorite scenes from New York.",5,A major gift for Woody Allen Fans.

977542,A2ATWKOFJXRRR1,B000EQHXNW,"B. Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[3, 8]","Some reviewers and movie-goers have been stunned by the transformation of Woody Allen as a director because of this film, and there's no doubt that this is a step in the right direction. His horrible, horrible, horrible film THE CURSE OF THE JADE SCORPION completely turned me off (not to mention some of his less-than-appropriate personal behavior ...but that's another story). Woody had trouble seeing himself as an older guy in many of his more recent releases and seriously miscast himself in roles that were never intended for a short, balding, and aging man.Thankfully, here in MATCH POINT, Woody's balding pate never makes an appearance. He's planted firmly behind the camera as director, and this is a very good thing (but not a great one).I will give Woody Allen credit; he's gone off his previously overly beaten path and is branching out into realms unknown to him. Match Point is a case in point (no pun intended). Here we have a young tennis pro stud named Chris Wilton (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) who comes to London from Ireland in pursuit of a better life. He meets up with a nice, wealthy young man named Tom and is quickly introduced to his sister Chloe (Emily Mortimer). A relationship starts to build but not before Chris runs into Tom's fianc?, Nola (Scarlett Johansson), a blond bombshell who's ready to ignite anything near her. Chris marries Chloe but not before having ""an encounter"" with Nola, setting the stage for a relationship nightmare in the future. Tom breaks up with Nola, thus allowing Chris more access to her, but when pregnancies, family fortunes, and the future of everything Chris has been working for comes to a head, he has to make a choice; a terrible and wrong ...but lucky choice.I don't want to give too much away here in case some of you decide to watch the flick. If you've seen it already, let me say that I don't agree with Chris' choice (obviously) but one can see why a man (or woman) could be driven to do such a horrendous thing.I'm gauging this film based on other movies, not just other Woody Allen movies - thus my negative rating. Although this is a giant leap in the right direction for Mr. Allen, it still held a narcoleptic pace. The acting was okay, nothing extraordinary, but nothing to jump up and down about either. The sets ...eh. Nothing great there either. The dialogue was okay but sometimes felt forced and speedy. When Chris first meets Nola over a ping-pong table, their actions and emotions feel rushed.Match Point has been compared, in theme, to Hitchcock. I beg to differ. Woody isn't that good, but perhaps with a little time he'll get there.",3,"You're Headed In The Right Direction, Mr. Allen",1147392000,"05 12, 2006",2006,2613,"['reviewers', 'movie-goers', 'have', 'been', 'stunned', 'transformation', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'director', 'film', 'doubt', 'step', 'right', 'direction', 'horrible', 'horrible', 'horrible', 'film', 'THE', 'CURSE', 'THE', 'JADE', 'SCORPION', 'completely', 'turned', 'off', 'not', 'mention', 'less-than-appropriate', 'personal', 'behavior', 'story', 'Woody', 'had', 'trouble', 'seeing', 'older', 'guy', 'many', 'more', 'recent', 'releases', 'seriously', 'miscast', 'roles', 'were', 'never', 'intended', 'short', 'balding', 'aging', 'man.Thankfully', 'here', 'MATCH', 'POINT', 'Woody', 'balding', 'pate', 'never', 'appearance', 'planted', 'firmly', 'camera', 'director', 'very', 'good', 'thing', 'not', 'great', 'one', 'will', 'give', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'credit', 'gone', 'off', 'previously', 'overly', 'beaten', 'path', 'branching', 'out', 'realms', 'unknown', 'Match', 'Point', 'case', 'point', 'pun', 'intended', 'Here', 'have', 'young', 'tennis', 'pro', 'stud', 'named', 'Chris', 'Wilton', 'Jonathan', 'Rhys', 'Meyers', 'who', 'London', 'Ireland', 'pursuit', 'better', 'life', 'up', 'nice', 'wealthy', 'young', 'man', 'named', 'Tom', 'quickly', 'introduced', 'sister', 'Chloe', 'Emily', 'Mortimer', 'relationship', 'build', 'not', 'Chris', 'Tom', 'fianc', 'Nola', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'blond', 'bombshell', 'who', 'ready', 'ignite', 'anything', 'Chris', 'marries', 'Chloe', 'not', 'having', 'encounter', 'Nola', 'setting', 'stage', 'relationship', 'nightmare', 'future', 'Tom', 'up', 'Nola', 'thus', 'allowing', 'Chris', 'more', 'access', 'when', 'pregnancies', 'family', 'fortunes', 'future', 'everything', 'Chris', 'been', 'working', 'head', 'make', 'choice', 'terrible', 'wrong', 'lucky', 'choice.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'too', 'much', 'away', 'here', 'case', 'decide', 'watch', 'flick', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'already', 'let', 'say', 'do', ""n't"", 'agree', 'Chris', 'choice', 'obviously', 'one', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'man', 'woman', 'could', 'be', 'driven', 'do', 'horrendous', 'thing.I', ""'m"", 'gauging', 'film', 'based', 'other', 'movies', 'not', 'just', 'other', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'movies', 'thus', 'negative', 'rating', 'giant', 'leap', 'right', 'direction', 'Mr.', 'Allen', 'still', 'held', 'narcoleptic', 'pace', 'acting', 'was', 'okay', 'nothing', 'extraordinary', 'nothing', 'jump', 'up', 'down', 'sets', 'eh', 'Nothing', 'great', 'there', 'either', 'dialogue', 'was', 'okay', 'sometimes', 'felt', 'forced', 'speedy', 'When', 'Chris', 'first', 'Nola', 'ping-pong', 'table', 'actions', 'emotions', 'feel', 'rushed.Match', 'Point', 'been', 'compared', 'theme', 'Hitchcock', 'beg', 'differ', 'Woody', ""n't"", 'that', 'good', 'perhaps', 'little', 'time', ""'ll"", 'get', 'there']",Match Point

You could spend the rest of your life studying his films - I believe I saw that someone is researching a Ph.D. thesis on the use of opera in ""Match Point."" Someone, somewhere, is preparing the definitive comparison of ""Match Point"" with ""Crimes and Misdemeanors,"" and will hopefully put all related questions to rest. And don't even mention New York vs London.Well, I have seen a few Woody Allen films, enjoyed many of them, and have largely forgotten most since ""The Purple Rose of Cairo."" I wouldn't be a very respected member of the discussion circle. But I enjoyed this film a lot. Among other things, I think it is well-written, well-acted, and has a lot of techniques that remind me of the Woody Allen films I enjoyed so much. Like when Chris, the protagonist, encounters someone he knows on the street and starts talking to them - but you don't see them until they walk into the camera's range. Little things like that. The film doesn't have a traditional Hollywood ending, in my opinion, and I thought it was very fitting that opera played such a key role. The few opera librettos that I have seen are really very simple as stories, and don't demand a lot of thinking on the part of the listeners/viewers. The film revolves around the role of chance, or luck, in certain key events of life, and - on an individual basis - I think it's an interesting point. And a bonus: now I know why the Italian custodians at school used to listen to opera all night while cleaning the classrooms. That alone makes the film worth seeing.I found a few things a little stretch in credibility: I don't think a ruling class family as wealthy and established as the Hewitts would be quite so susceptible to the intrusion of ""lower-class"" outsiders. But warning: everything I know about the personal behavior of rich people I learned from watching The Gilmore Girls. And I found Nola, the character played by Scarlet Johanssen, to be a little hard to believe. She morphs from a self-confident flirt at the beginning to a desperate victim at the end, without any clear line of development, although the ping-pong game foretells how the relationship will proceed. Nola is such a key player, but I find her somewhat unconvincing, perhaps more due to ellipses in the script than to problems with her acting.

977547,A1JCWK43MAGZIG,B000EQHXNW,"By Definition ""By Definition""","[3, 10]","Most thrillers, such as Basic Instinct, Maltese Falcon, Bullitt, or North by Northwest...can be enjoyed over and over because of their overpowering sense of style. Perhaps the greatest sin of the ""average"" thriller is, despite the redemption it offers in the end, it can make murder appear ""glamorous"" or at least clothe the crimes in a stylish cinematic technique.Match Point's fundamentally different approach denies us the stylish pleasures and light humor of the typical thriller while also denying redemption and justice. Which for many, will truly bring a sense of disgust.Match Point is not stylish or cool. There are no comfortable barriers here. It is a movie you can watch only once, but the awful story may stay with you forever.Time and again we had to keep telling ourselves ""This is just a movie."" The tension and procrastination of the situation Chris gets himself into is just unbelievable; I was practically clawing my eyes out. This guy is nuts!In the end, Chris does what is expedient, and damn what may go on inside him. Perhaps Allen will make a ""Match Point 2"" in which Chris is shown raising his children and still shielding his guilt. ;-)The focus for everyone is on Chris' impossibly contradicted state of mind. I thought he was going to have a nervous breakdown and kill himself. How can he live with his wife Chloe and her family and not inadvertently reveal his inner turmoil? I don't buy it. Or if I do buy it, that cannot possibly be the end of the story.The ending is unsatisfying by the measure of conventional drama for at least three reasons:1. There is no redemption.2. There is no release.3. There is no resolution.The viewer is denied the satisfaction of resolution and the relief of justice served. There is no denouement. Except perhaps for the ""relief"" that occurs after the actual murders. Unlike your typical thriller, I really felt that what happened was appalling, beyond the cinematic sense of ""appalling"". The penetrating depth and truthfulness was unlike any other ""thriller"", if one can even call this film a thriller. It's unpleasant to watch.So Woody Allen has made a REALLY original movie here, which takes some rather unique turns within the suspense genre that I really haven't seen before. It is indeed Hitchcock, minus the lighthearted Hitchcock humor. There isn't a grain of humor in this movie! Nothing to break the tension, which is why I was still shaking for ten minutes after seeing it. Even the score, which consists solely of scratchy opera recordings, provides no relief.The brutal and naked immorality of the crime Match Point depicts is itself as strong and astringent a moral statement as I think I have ever seen in a film. Chris commits a crime against everyone, even himself.I don't think this is the kind of story people go to movies for. It is the kind of story people go to church for. It is not ""entertainment"". It can only make you glad you're living your own life and not Chris'. The only thing left is GUILT. Not external guilt, not the kind associated with a gavel pounding on a bench or with handcuffs and prison bars. This is a wrenching story of internal guilt.For the opposite type of story, see a thriller from the Watergate era (circa 1972), such as ""The Getaway"" or ""The Hot Rock.""",4,Hitchcock was way funnier than this,1145750400,"04 23, 2006",2006,3266,"['Most', 'thrillers', 'such', 'Basic', 'Instinct', 'Maltese', 'Falcon', 'Bullitt', 'North', 'Northwest', 'can', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'overpowering', 'sense', 'style', 'Perhaps', 'greatest', 'sin', 'average', 'thriller', 'redemption', 'end', 'can', 'make', 'murder', 'glamorous', 'least', 'clothe', 'crimes', 'stylish', 'cinematic', 'technique.Match', 'Point', 'fundamentally', 'different', 'approach', 'stylish', 'pleasures', 'light', 'humor', 'typical', 'thriller', 'also', 'denying', 'redemption', 'justice', 'Which', 'many', 'will', 'truly', 'bring', 'sense', 'disgust.Match', 'Point', 'not', 'stylish', 'cool', 'are', 'comfortable', 'barriers', 'here', 'movie', 'can', 'watch', 'only', 'once', 'awful', 'story', 'may', 'stay', 'forever.Time', 'again', 'had', 'keep', 'telling', 'just', 'movie', 'tension', 'procrastination', 'situation', 'Chris', 'just', 'unbelievable', 'was', 'practically', 'clawing', 'eyes', 'out', 'guy', 'nuts', 'end', 'Chris', 'what', 'expedient', 'damn', 'what', 'may', 'go', 'Perhaps', 'Allen', 'will', 'make', 'Match', 'Point', '2', 'Chris', 'shown', 'raising', 'children', 'still', 'shielding', 'guilt', 'focus', 'everyone', 'Chris', 'impossibly', 'contradicted', 'state', 'mind', 'thought', 'was', 'going', 'have', 'nervous', 'breakdown', 'kill', 'How', 'can', 'live', 'wife', 'Chloe', 'family', 'not', 'inadvertently', 'reveal', 'inner', 'turmoil', 'do', ""n't"", 'buy', 'do', 'buy', 'can', 'not', 'possibly', 'be', 'end', 'story.The', 'ending', 'unsatisfying', 'measure', 'conventional', 'drama', 'least', 'three', 'reasons:1', 'redemption.2', 'release.3', 'resolution.The', 'viewer', 'denied', 'satisfaction', 'resolution', 'relief', 'justice', 'served', 'denouement', 'perhaps', 'relief', 'actual', 'murders', 'typical', 'thriller', 'really', 'felt', 'what', 'happened', 'was', 'appalling', 'cinematic', 'sense', 'appalling', 'penetrating', 'depth', 'truthfulness', 'was', 'other', 'thriller', 'one', 'can', 'even', 'call', 'film', 'thriller', 'unpleasant', 'watch.So', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'made', 'REALLY', 'original', 'movie', 'here', 'rather', 'unique', 'turns', 'suspense', 'genre', 'really', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'before', 'indeed', 'Hitchcock', 'minus', 'lighthearted', 'Hitchcock', 'humor', ""n't"", 'grain', 'humor', 'movie', 'Nothing', 'break', 'tension', 'why', 'was', 'still', 'shaking', 'ten', 'minutes', 'seeing', 'Even', 'score', 'solely', 'scratchy', 'opera', 'recordings', 'relief.The', 'brutal', 'naked', 'immorality', 'crime', 'Match', 'Point', 'strong', 'astringent', 'moral', 'statement', 'think', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'film', 'Chris', 'crime', 'everyone', 'even', 'himself.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'kind', 'story', 'people', 'go', 'movies', 'kind', 'story', 'people', 'go', 'church', 'not', 'entertainment', 'can', 'only', 'make', 'glad', ""'re"", 'living', 'own', 'life', 'not', 'Chris', 'only', 'thing', 'left', 'GUILT', 'Not', 'external', 'guilt', 'not', 'kind', 'associated', 'gavel', 'pounding', 'bench', 'handcuffs', 'prison', 'bars', 'wrenching', 'story', 'internal', 'guilt.For', 'opposite', 'type', 'story', 'see', 'thriller', 'Watergate', 'era', 'circa', '1972', 'such', 'Getaway', 'Hot', 'Rock']",Match Point

977551,A3VIOCJZ22JZXT,B000EQHXNW,C. B Collins Jr.,"[0, 1]","The title of this film is ""Match Point"" which refers to the main character, Chris Walton's profession as a former professional tennis player. It also refers to chance or luck and how luck may direct our destiny and course of action. I also think the term Match Point may refer to Woody Allen playing a game that Patricia Highsmith plays so well in ""Strangers on a Train"" and ""The Amazing Mr. Ripley"" which is the game of determining under what conditions and stresses might an ordinary person commit a terrible murder.The character of Chris Walton, played beautifully by Jonathan Rhys Meyers, is certainly typical of Highsmith. He is the handsome but talented man of humble beginnings who seeks the finer things in life and will actually reach the point where he will kill to maintain his lifestyle. He is coldly calculating with many social skills and a bright intellect. Thus when ultra-rich Chloe Hewett falls in love with him, he is only too obliging to be seduced and to marry this pleasant and gentle heiress. Yet he is driven by passion and obsession for his brother-in-law's girlfriend, Nola Rice, played perfectly by Scarlett Johansson.The film does a good job of demonstrating how hot passions may come and go and are rarely the basis for sound decision making.This is a different pattern than was seen in Theodore Dressler's An American Tragedy, though there are similar plot devices. In An American Tragedy, a young poor man is offered romance with a beautiful rich girl if only he did not have a pregnant girlfriend at the time. This is pure Highsmith since it is the desperations, the calculations, the lack of guilt, the cool cover-up, and the final lack of remorse that makes Chris more akin to Ripley.Woody tries to throw us off the track by having Chris read Dostoevsky's Crime and Punishment and then refer to this book several times throughout the film. Woody even has the crime of passion involve an innocent land lady like is seen in Crime in Punishment. But the consciousness of Woody's main character is more Highsmith than Dostoevsky. He is sophisticated evil residing in a man of grace and beauty.The plot is well constructed and logical yet never reveals too much. The viewer is really not sure how Chris will decide between his pregnant wife and his pregnant mistress or how he will work himself out of the terrible mess he has created. Woody creates a building tension and apprehension as the film moves to an unexpected climax.",4,Woody Allen plays a Patricia Highsmith game,1200182400,"01 13, 2008",2008,2457,"['title', 'film', 'Match', 'Point', 'main', 'character', 'Chris', 'Walton', 'profession', 'former', 'professional', 'tennis', 'player', 'also', 'chance', 'luck', 'how', 'luck', 'may', 'direct', 'destiny', 'course', 'action', 'also', 'think', 'term', 'Match', 'Point', 'may', 'refer', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'playing', 'game', 'Patricia', 'Highsmith', 'so', 'well', 'Strangers', 'Train', 'Amazing', 'Mr.', 'Ripley', 'game', 'determining', 'what', 'conditions', 'stresses', 'might', 'ordinary', 'person', 'commit', 'terrible', 'murder.The', 'character', 'Chris', 'Walton', 'played', 'beautifully', 'Jonathan', 'Rhys', 'Meyers', 'certainly', 'typical', 'Highsmith', 'handsome', 'talented', 'man', 'humble', 'beginnings', 'who', 'finer', 'things', 'life', 'will', 'actually', 'reach', 'point', 'where', 'will', 'kill', 'maintain', 'lifestyle', 'coldly', 'calculating', 'many', 'social', 'skills', 'bright', 'intellect', 'Thus', 'when', 'ultra-rich', 'Chloe', 'Hewett', 'love', 'only', 'too', 'obliging', 'be', 'seduced', 'marry', 'pleasant', 'gentle', 'heiress', 'driven', 'passion', 'obsession', 'brother-in-law', 'girlfriend', 'Nola', 'Rice', 'played', 'perfectly', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson.The', 'film', 'good', 'job', 'demonstrating', 'how', 'hot', 'passions', 'may', 'come', 'go', 'are', 'rarely', 'basis', 'sound', 'decision', 'making.This', 'different', 'pattern', 'was', 'seen', 'Theodore', 'Dressler', 'American', 'Tragedy', 'are', 'similar', 'plot', 'devices', 'American', 'Tragedy', 'young', 'poor', 'man', 'offered', 'romance', 'beautiful', 'rich', 'girl', 'only', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'pregnant', 'girlfriend', 'time', 'pure', 'Highsmith', 'desperations', 'calculations', 'lack', 'guilt', 'cool', 'cover-up', 'final', 'lack', 'remorse', 'Chris', 'more', 'akin', 'Ripley.Woody', 'throw', 'off', 'track', 'having', 'Chris', 'read', 'Dostoevsky', 'Crime', 'Punishment', 'then', 'refer', 'book', 'several', 'times', 'film', 'Woody', 'even', 'crime', 'passion', 'involve', 'innocent', 'land', 'lady', 'seen', 'Crime', 'Punishment', 'consciousness', 'Woody', 'main', 'character', 'more', 'Highsmith', 'Dostoevsky', 'sophisticated', 'evil', 'residing', 'man', 'grace', 'beauty.The', 'plot', 'well', 'constructed', 'logical', 'yet', 'never', 'reveals', 'too', 'much', 'viewer', 'really', 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'Chris', 'will', 'decide', 'pregnant', 'wife', 'pregnant', 'mistress', 'how', 'will', 'work', 'terrible', 'mess', 'created', 'Woody', 'building', 'tension', 'apprehension', 'film', 'moves', 'unexpected', 'climax']",Match Point

977557,A3BEF4IHWI0VC,B000EQHXNW,Chris Luallen,"[1, 1]","""Match Point"" is quite a departure from your typical Woody Allen movie. It is set in London rather than New York, it has an opera soundtrack rather than jazz and, most significantly, it is a dramatic thriller without even a hint of comedy. Does this change in style work for Allen? Well somewhat, but not  entirely. It's far better than Woody's recent mediocre efforts, especially last year's horrible ""Melinda And Melinda"". But still it is far off from the best of Woody Allen's work, such as ""Annie Hall"", Hannah And Her Sisters"", and ""Crimes And Misdemeanors"", among others.Chris Wilton (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers) is a young Irishman who has given up his career as a tennis pro and taken up a position as a tennis instructor at a school offering classes for London's wealthy and elite. Here he befriends Tom Hewitt (Matthew Goode), a young man from an upper crust English family. Chris is soon invited to meet the Hewitt family and then begins dating Tom's sister Chloe. He also meets, and immediately begins lusting for, Nola Rice - a struggling young American actress who is engaged to Tom. Chloe falls hard for Chris and, hoping for a future together, has her father find Chris a well paying executive postion within his company. Chris and Chloe get married and seem on their way to a comfortable life together. But Chris' lust for Nola overwhelms him and they, since Nola was recently dropped by Tom, begin a passionate affair. Nola soon becomes pregnant and pressures Chris to end his marriage to Chloe. But Chris, unwilling to give up his new found wealthy lifestyle, instead carries out a plot to murder Nola. He is then left to deal with his conscience, while a moment of good fortune allows him to escape further police investigation.The storyline managed to hold my attention but was far from captivating or original. Also, unlike most Woody Allen movies, I really could not find a character to relate to or empathize with. Chris and Nola were both amoral social climbers behaving badly and Chris also ended up being a heartless murderer in the end. Meanwhile, Tom and Chloe were spoiled, rich kids without enough of a personality to make me feel strongly one way or the other about them. The movie did attempt to make an intellectual statement about the importance of luck in human affairs. But it was used more as a plot device to tie up the story line than as something that struck me as really profound or insightful.

And the opening scene where a tennis ball lingered above the net, about to decide which side it will fall on, nicely echoes the shot near the end where the critical diamond ring lingered above the fence, about to decide the fate of the young man.Third, Scarlett Johansson as Nora is a natural beauty who captures every scene in a seemingly effortless and unpretentious way.

Since then I've kind of avoided his movies since they're usually the same thing. On a recent rental check, the only thing that even remotely interested me was Match Point so I thought ""meh, why not?"" Well turns out it's 0 for...I don't know how many movies he's got but I didn't really like this one.Chris(Jonathan Rhys-Meyers) is a former tennis pro living in London. He meets Tom and Chloe(Emily Mortimer) who instantly falls for Chris. They begin a courtship until Chris meets Tom's fiance Nola(Scarlett Johanssen). Chris very much likes Nola but he's with Chloe but that doesn't stop him from starting an affair which makes you wonder how exactly do you stop a marriage from falling apart when you have a mistress.In watching the film, 2 things struck me: how oddball the editing is and how the writing didn't strike me that much. Little scenes happen here and there to give some ""insight"" into character's lives but they're so fleeting they don't really give you anything. Ooh a character reads a book, so they like to read! A character has a quick thing at the office so he must be busy! But that's all it is, it's a lazy attempt at giving character's some added depth where the writing failed. But then we get scenes that kind of go on forever that don't reveal anything. Doesn't help that the writing is kind of stagnant and the delivery is worse.Where the film does pick up though is how Chris deals with his problem which is quite gritty and raw. However there is some plotholes that are easy to figure out if you think about it. But it does present a good anti-adultery message, especially when pregnancy is involved. In a weird way it does come out of left field since the film's so talky than it becomes, I don't know, a Coppola movie for one scene.Is there much good in this film? Well the ending and the turn Chris' character takes is good but everything else leading up to it is so plain that I actually started to play guitar and read while the movie was playing.

Middleton,"[5, 7]","Although similar to Allen's Crimes and Mesdemeanors, (1989) Match Point differs in many significant areas, including the ruthless social climbing of the protagonist, Chris Wilton, (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) as he moves into London's wealthy class.Meyers gave a compelling and strong performance as Chris Wilton reminding me of the literary character, Tom Ripley, who similarly pushes his way up the social ladder using anything at his disposal to attain what he wants, including murder. Ripley has often been characterized as the likable sociopath and villain, however, there's really nothing to like about Wilton, finding myself throughout the viewing wanting him to stumble and be discovered as the fraud he truly is. Wilton is handsome and charming, subtlety seducing Chloe Hewitt (Emily Mortimer) the daughter of a wealthy business man, Alec Hewitt (Brian Cox) eventually wriggles into their world of class and privilege.Nola Rice (Scarlett Johansson) is a mid-western girl trying to become an actress in London. Rice meets the Hewitt son Tom, (Matthew Goode) and becomes his fianc&eacute;.Johansson's performance is right on the mark, a sultry and beautiful femme fatale, whose sexual magnetism pulls the now married Chris Wilton into a lurid and obsessive affair. The scenes between Johansson and Meyers are performed extremely well as one can at times fill the heat come off the screen.Unfortunately it has been stated in other reviews that Allen is out of his comfort zone in London making this picture and this is reflected in the production - I couldn't disagree more as Remi Adefarasin's cinematography is at times brilliant, capturing many beautiful areas of London. This film was indeed creatively and professionally shot.Woody Allen's screenplay, well, particularly the dialogue, is absolutely shining with wit and depth. In fact it is the dialogue the carries the film along. After a slew of average films, (for Woody Allen) Match Point stands out as and can stand with, his other master pieces such as Hannah and her Sisters, Crimes and Mesdemeanors, Annie Hall and The Purple Rose of Cairo.As a Woody Allen fan for many years, I've followed his career through its ups and downs, and Match Point clearly demonstrates that the old master continues to have what it takes to create a great film.",5,The Old Master gives us a Beauty,1168041600,"01 6, 2007",2007,2304,"['similar', 'Allen', 'Crimes', 'Mesdemeanors', '1989', 'Match', 'Point', 'differs', 'many', 'significant', 'areas', 'including', 'ruthless', 'social', 'climbing', 'protagonist', 'Chris', 'Wilton', 'Jonathan', 'Rhys', 'Meyers', 'London', 'wealthy', 'class.Meyers', 'gave', 'compelling', 'strong', 'performance', 'Chris', 'Wilton', 'reminding', 'literary', 'character', 'Tom', 'Ripley', 'who', 'similarly', 'way', 'social', 'ladder', 'using', 'anything', 'disposal', 'attain', 'what', 'including', 'murder', 'Ripley', 'often', 'been', 'characterized', 'likable', 'sociopath', 'villain', 'however', 'really', 'nothing', 'like', 'Wilton', 'finding', 'viewing', 'wanting', 'stumble', 'be', 'discovered', 'fraud', 'truly', 'Wilton', 'handsome', 'charming', 'subtlety', 'seducing', 'Chloe', 'Hewitt', 'Emily', 'Mortimer', 'daughter', 'wealthy', 'business', 'man', 'Alec', 'Hewitt', 'Brian', 'Cox', 'eventually', 'world', 'class', 'privilege.Nola', 'Rice', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'mid-western', 'girl', 'trying', 'become', 'actress', 'London', 'Rice', 'Hewitt', 'son', 'Tom', 'Matthew', 'Goode', 'fianc', 'eacute', '.Johansson', 'performance', 'right', 'mark', 'sultry', 'beautiful', 'femme', 'fatale', 'sexual', 'magnetism', 'now', 'married', 'Chris', 'Wilton', 'lurid', 'obsessive', 'affair', 'scenes', 'Johansson', 'Meyers', 'are', 'performed', 'extremely', 'well', 'one', 'can', 'times', 'fill', 'heat', 'come', 'screen.Unfortunately', 'been', 'stated', 'other', 'reviews', 'Allen', 'comfort', 'zone', 'London', 'making', 'picture', 'reflected', 'production', 'could', ""n't"", 'disagree', 'more', 'Remi', 'Adefarasin', 'cinematography', 'times', 'brilliant', 'capturing', 'many', 'beautiful', 'areas', 'London', 'film', 'was', 'indeed', 'creatively', 'professionally', 'shot.Woody', 'Allen', 'screenplay', 'well', 'particularly', 'dialogue', 'absolutely', 'shining', 'wit', 'depth', 'fact', 'dialogue', 'film', 'slew', 'average', 'films', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'Match', 'Point', 'out', 'can', 'stand', 'other', 'master', 'pieces', 'such', 'Hannah', 'Sisters', 'Crimes', 'Mesdemeanors', 'Annie', 'Hall', 'Purple', 'Rose', 'Cairo.As', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'fan', 'many', 'years', ""'ve"", 'followed', 'career', 'ups', 'downs', 'Match', 'Point', 'clearly', 'old', 'master', 'have', 'what', 'create', 'great', 'film']",Match Point

977565,A3SFO2GSP5CVSM,B000EQHXNW,"Cosmoetica ""cosmoeticadotcom""","[0, 1]","The critical buzz about Woody Allen's latest film, Match Point, is that it's his best since (fill in the blank), and, to a degree, that's true. The last of his films to attain even a limited greatness was 1999's Sweet And Lowdown, with the magnificent performances of Sean Penn  and Samantha Morton, and the last flat out great Allen film was 1992's Husbands And Wives. But a case can be made that this film is his best since 1989's Crimes And Misdemeanors, the film which is its most obvious philosophic and narrative ancestor. That said, in a sense, this film is also sort of a `Best Of' Woody Allen film, which reuses many of the best scenes and motifs of his best work.There is the obvious nod to Crimes And Misdemeanors, in that this film follows a murderer who gets away with his crime of killing his mistress when she gets too clingy and demanding. But, there are nods to Interiors, with the end shot of the film, as the protagonist gazes out a window into a vacant sky, Annie Hall with the scenes of tennis, and several others. Also, as always, there is Allen's `grand idea' that propels the film; in this case another one he has used before, that of luck being the single greatest determinant in someone's success or failure writ small or large, not ethics.... Whether or not this terrific film signals a quality fluke, for Allen's stealing shamelessly from earlier great outings may belie a creative bankruptcy (although one could argue the reassemblage or collage is creative in its own right), or a renascent final Silver Age to bookend his Golden Age (1977's Annie Hall through 1992's Husbands And Wives), only the next few films will herald, but I'd love to see Allen stay away from New York for the next four or five films, and really push himself hard narratively, in a final creative burst. The editing of the film is very crisp, and at only about two hours, the film feels far longer and richer, in the best sense.

One becomes his wife from whose family affords him a wealthy lifestyle and a lucrative career.  He's love for her is real and it is a comforting Eros that has all the marks being built for a lifetime.  His mistress, however, is only of modest means but, in contrast to his wife, is mercurial, exciting, and erotic.  Naturally, it is the mistress that becomes pregnant.  As his mistress puts pressure on him to leave his wealth and wife for her, he struggles with how to live with the best of both worlds.  Under the threat that the mistress will inform the wife, the young man hatches a murder plot which succeeds only by a single happenstance of fortune.This could have been an excellent and well told story; but its unusual plot is completely ruined by a plodding, graduate school concern to show literary sophistication.  In other words, it is quite dull.  A complete waste of the talents of the actors.This film has all the things we have come to love and hate coming from Woody Allen.  The main character is a pipe for Allen's own belief in universe without justice and purpose.  It is not exactly a warming point of view; but it does provide the mainspring for the story's novel resolution.  At the same time, the film is at pains to show the cosmopolitanism, refined taste, and the odd belief that ordinary human concerns and pursuits are raised to Olympian, rarified heights by eccentricity Allen projects on his characters.  This is all too precious.  To add to the lack of verisimilitude, the mistress is an unemployed actress of a modest background who is forced to take a low paying job in London; yet she seems to have lots of spare time, spends loads of money, and lives in an apartment we should all be so lucky to get much the same as her wealthy counterparts.In the end, our murderer is confronted by the ghosts of his victims.  It is here that the story's ""message"" comes through.  It is tempting to construe the murderer's calm rebuff to these specters as a mere rationalization.  Instead, it is Allen's resolution of the old theological problem the presence of evil in a universe under the control of a good, all-powerful God.To wit:  There is no God.  No purpose.  No justice.  Evil exists--but it simply ""is"" as all other things in life ""are"".I doubt if Allen thinks he came across this viewpoint all by himself.  A man as well read as Allen surely knows this variety of nihilism can be found in the ancient Greeks.  Be that as it may, it is hardly a thought underrepresented in modern culture.  This is where I fault Allen the most.  Most of nihilism's acolytes have the good sense to make their hobbyhorse entertaining and fun.  There are musicians who believe their tune making is more artistic and ""musical"" if they avoid all the attractive ""hooks"".  Perhaps Allen believes his molasses-like, mirthless narrative is a mark of thoughtful seriousness.

What begins amid manners and mores as an exploration of relationships and social climbing (and luck) enters its final act as something else entirely: a psychological drama of intensely suspenseful proportions. This frigidly detached British-flavored drama was aptly billed with a tag line taken from a critic's interpretation as he asked, ""Think you know how it will end? Guess again.""

The reason being is that it's refreshing.  It's smart and intoxicating, and while nothing really new it's original in it's own unoriginality.  In other words it feels better than the average film.  Chris (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) is an Irish tennis instructor whos moved to London and is just trying to make it when he meets Tom Hewett (Matthew Goode) and through Tom he meets Chloe (Emily Mortimer), Tom's sister.  Chloe falls in love with Chris quickly, and Chloe's family does as well, falling for his charm and giving him a high position in the family business so he can support their daughter.  All seems well until Chris meets Nola Rice (Scarlett Johansson) and he's immediatly smitten with her beauty and apparent sexuality.  Some of his first words to her are ""has anyone ever told you you have very sensual lips?""  I'm sure they have.  Nola, confident in her affect on the opposite sex, plays with him almost, leading him on by a string as he desires her more and more.  The problem is that she is engaged to Tom, and through the course of time Chris becomes engaged to Chloe.  Eventually though thier desires for one another turn to lust and that lust manifest itself in an afair, an afair that continues past Chris's marriage to Chloe and Tom's split from Nola.  Chris is satisfied with his situation until Nola demands more, demands he leave his wife and marry her.  Now Chris is faced with a problem.  He's comfortable with his life, his easy life, and he doesn't want to destroy that.  He doesn't want to sacrifice his comfortable marriage and easy money for a lust driven relationship but Nola is getting desperate and is jeopordizing everything.  ""Be reasonable...""  Will he?

Keep your eye the ball (or ring) as it hits the net, or perhaps a railing.  Whether it falls forward or backward can make all the difference in the world.I can't believe that tennis players say the same thing that poker players say: ""I'd rather be lucky than good.""  Poker players say that because there is a significant element of chance involved in any given hand; and besides they already think they're good.  It is the other guy who is lucky.Jonathan Rhys-Meyers stars as Chris Wilton, a poor Irish boy on the make.  He is handsome, charming, smart, and a very good tennis player who is candid about not quite being good enough against the very best.  He gets a job teaching tennis at an exclusive English club and quickly meets and charms a very rich student (Matthew Goode as Tom Hewitt) who has a sister (Chole, played by Emily Mortimer) who finds him irresistible.Well, how lucky can you get?  Complication: Scarlett (the sexiest woman on earth, at one time, anyway, according to some magazine) Johansson playing Nola Rice, who is seriously dating the very eligible Tom Hewitt.  (You could say she's on the make as well.)  She's an American would-be actress who can't quite wow them at the auditions in London.  She is sitting pretty however because if she marries Tom she will be set for life.I could go on, but the plot is so delicious that I don't want to spoil it for you.  It's a variation on the venerable theme of rake's progress, employing in an interesting way the old adage, ""The man who marries for money earns it.""  I have only one criticism of this especially well directed effort from the redoubtable Mr. Allen: you could have done without that cheesy ghost or hallucination scene near the end, involving sweet lips Scarlett and her neighbor.See this for Woody Allen, who is just as smooth with this upscale noir/Hitchcockian thriller as he is with his renowned comedic and satirical efforts.

Also, it is fantastic to see how he has cared about landscapes in the town and at the village.The treatment of the actors is what you can expect from Allen. Scarlett and Jonathan are incredible.

Especially anything that doesn't feature Allen in his signature comedy/anlayzing life type of work.Match Point is a slow paced mystery that keeps the viewer wondering what will happen next.  None of the characters create any real emotional connection with the audience; viewers will probably like and dislike them all in one way or another.  But this turns  out to be the genius of the work.  There is no need to become involved on an emotional level with the characters themselves; it is the story itself that keeps one involved. The music, the scenery and the setting are so beautiful and engaging that they, too, contribute to this effect. There really is no ""bad guy"" or ""good guy"" to root for or against.The tennis ""match point"" theme, and the idea that life is as much about luck as anything else, should have been drawn on a bit more, especially toward the end of the film.  Even resorting to a ""flashback"" memory of the ball teetering on the net (shown at the beginning of the film) would have been a useful device to tantalize the audience about what choice the main character is going make next. This would have caused the suspense level to have been built up a bit earlier on, with more of a transition into the characters' evolution. As it is, the suspense comes on rather suddenly about three quarters of the way through the film.  That is not to imply that the film isn't interesting until then.  It is; things could just have begun sooner.Some are calling the film ""Hitchcockian"", however it doesn't contain the element of suspense all the way through to equate it with Hitchcock's work.

Bukowsky ""booklover10""","[6, 7]","""Match Point,"" which is set in London, stars Jonathan Rhys-Meyers as Chris Wilton, a handsome but poor young tennis player who has quit the professional tour.  He is marking time at a posh club giving tennis lessons to upper crust clients.  One of his students is the charming Tom Hewett, whose sister, Chloe, quickly falls for him.  Chris seems to reciprocate Chloe's feelings until he meets and becomes obsessed by Tom's fianc&eacute;e, a sultry blonde named Nola Rice.If Chris marries Chloe, he will be set for life, since Chloe's father is willing to groom him for a job in his successful business empire.  As the son-in-law of Alec Hewett, Chris would have prestige, a luxurious home, a personal driver, an expense account, and all the perks that go with being married to the daughter of a rich and generous man.  If he pursues Nola, Chris stands to lose his best chance of permanently escaping the poverty of his childhood.The first half of ""Match Point"" is brilliant.  Meyers is mesmerizing as a self-effacing, calculating, and unctuous social climber, whose underlying motives are buried beneath layers of politeness.  Johannson is at her most alluring as Nola, an insecure and penniless American whose sole asset is her gorgeous appearance. She is desperate to break into acting, but senses that she will never be good enough to succeed.  Brian Cox is wonderful as Alec Hewett, Chloe's kind-hearted father who takes Chris under his wing, hoping that this young man will make his daughter happy.  Penelope Wilton plays Eleanor Hewett, Alec's judgmental and outspoken wife, with icy calm.  Eleanor detests Nola and cannot abide the thought that this low class young woman will soon become her daughter-in-law.Woody Allen explores the universal themes of greed, lust, self-deception, and betrayal.  There is an old Yiddish proverb, ""Better an ounce of luck than a pound of gold.""  Chris believes that he can have everything he wants, including the gold, if his luck holds out.  Allen suggests that we may live in a world where justice is an unattainable ideal.  Our fate may be determined as much by chance as it is by our actions or our virtues.""Match Point"" is beautifully shot, tightly edited, and briskly paced.  Since Chris Wilton is an opera lover, Allen provides soaring background music by Verdi, Bizet, Donizetti, and Rossini.  I cannot reveal or even hint at the surprise ending, but the agonizing suspense in this film is at times reminiscent of a Hitchcock thriller.  Although the denouement is not entirely credible or satisfying, I guarantee that ""Match Point"" is one of those movies that viewers will be pondering and discussing for days after they leave the theater.",5,"""Better an ounce of luck than a pound of gold.""",1136592000,"01 7, 2006",2006,2688,"['Match', 'Point', 'set', 'London', 'Jonathan', 'Rhys-Meyers', 'Chris', 'Wilton', 'handsome', 'poor', 'young', 'tennis', 'player', 'who', 'quit', 'professional', 'tour', 'marking', 'time', 'posh', 'club', 'giving', 'tennis', 'lessons', 'upper', 'crust', 'clients', 'One', 'students', 'charming', 'Tom', 'Hewett', 'sister', 'Chloe', 'quickly', 'Chris', 'reciprocate', 'Chloe', 'feelings', 'becomes', 'obsessed', 'Tom', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'sultry', 'blonde', 'named', 'Nola', 'Rice.If', 'Chris', 'marries', 'Chloe', 'will', 'be', 'set', 'life', 'Chloe', 'father', 'willing', 'groom', 'job', 'successful', 'business', 'empire', 'son-in-law', 'Alec', 'Hewett', 'Chris', 'would', 'have', 'prestige', 'luxurious', 'home', 'personal', 'driver', 'expense', 'account', 'perks', 'go', 'being', 'married', 'daughter', 'rich', 'generous', 'man', 'Nola', 'Chris', 'lose', 'best', 'chance', 'permanently', 'escaping', 'poverty', 'childhood.The', 'first', 'half', 'Match', 'Point', 'brilliant', 'Meyers', 'mesmerizing', 'self-effacing', 'calculating', 'unctuous', 'social', 'climber', 'underlying', 'motives', 'are', 'buried', 'layers', 'politeness', 'Johannson', 'most', 'alluring', 'Nola', 'insecure', 'penniless', 'American', 'sole', 'asset', 'gorgeous', 'appearance', 'desperate', 'break', 'acting', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'good', 'enough', 'succeed', 'Brian', 'Cox', 'wonderful', 'Alec', 'Hewett', 'Chloe', 'kind-hearted', 'father', 'who', 'Chris', 'wing', 'hoping', 'young', 'man', 'will', 'make', 'daughter', 'happy', 'Penelope', 'Wilton', 'Eleanor', 'Hewett', 'Alec', 'judgmental', 'outspoken', 'wife', 'icy', 'calm', 'Eleanor', 'detests', 'Nola', 'can', 'not', 'abide', 'thought', 'low', 'class', 'young', 'woman', 'will', 'soon', 'become', 'daughter-in-law.Woody', 'Allen', 'universal', 'themes', 'greed', 'lust', 'self-deception', 'betrayal', 'old', 'Yiddish', 'proverb', 'Better', 'ounce', 'luck', 'pound', 'gold', 'Chris', 'can', 'have', 'everything', 'including', 'gold', 'luck', 'out', 'Allen', 'may', 'live', 'world', 'where', 'justice', 'unattainable', 'ideal', 'fate', 'may', 'be', 'determined', 'much', 'chance', 'actions', 'virtues', 'Match', 'Point', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'tightly', 'edited', 'briskly', 'paced', 'Chris', 'Wilton', 'opera', 'lover', 'Allen', 'soaring', 'music', 'Verdi', 'Bizet', 'Donizetti', 'Rossini', 'can', 'not', 'reveal', 'even', 'hint', 'surprise', 'ending', 'agonizing', 'suspense', 'film', 'times', 'reminiscent', 'Hitchcock', 'thriller', 'denouement', 'not', 'entirely', 'credible', 'satisfying', 'guarantee', 'Match', 'Point', 'one', 'movies', 'viewers', 'will', 'be', 'pondering', 'discussing', 'days', 'leave', 'theater']",Match Point

977588,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B000EQHXNW,Ed Uyeshima,"[1, 2]","While it's true that Woody Allen has had an erratic record as a filmmaker of late, there are definite pleasures to be had from his recent work such as 1999's ""Sweet and Lowdown"", 2000's ""Small Time Crooks"" and 2005's ""Melinda and Melinda"". However, what makes 2005's ""Match Point"" different from the usual Allen product is that it is an incessantly addictive film ripe with melodrama and suspense with little of Allen's angst-driven comedy. There are elements that will remind long-time Allen aficionados of 1989's ""Crimes and Misdemeanors"" and 1993's ""Manhattan Murder Mystery"", but at the same time, the film seems also inspired by Anthony Minghella's 1999 adaptation of Patricia Highsmith's ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"", George Stevens's 1951 ""A Place in the Sun"" based on Theodore Dreiser's ""An American Tragedy"", and Adrian Lyne's 1987 ""Fatal Attraction"".Set in contemporary London, a first for Allen, the intricate plot focuses on a failed pro tennis player, Chris Wilton, who lands a rather cushy job as a coach at a fancy private club. Through sheer luck - a consistent theme throughout for Chris - he befriends wealthy Tom Hewett and by way of an evening in the family's opera box, begins dating his guileless sister Chloe. Insinuating himself into the family with ease, including securing a nice job at one of the companies owned by Tom and Chloe's father, Chris becomes obsessed with Nola Rice, Tom's seductive American fianc&eacute;e, a failing actress of whom Tom and Chloe's mother vehemently disapproves. How they all intertwine is what makes up most of the action, and the story works like an ever-tightening noose around Chris's actions. Even though it plays out like a smart thriller, Allen brings a decidedly fatalistic tone that introduces greater issues of fate, retribution and justice. The themes don't weigh the film down unnecessarily, and in fact, the film's last half-hour brings all the higher-level issues together in a way that makes the conclusion resonate with unpredictable force.As Chris, Jonathan Rhys-Meyers brings an effectively opaque manner to his character that makes him neither sympathetic nor villainous but rather leaves him precariously off-balance to the viewer. It's a smartly rendered performance that teeters toward the predictable only toward the very end. Although her first scene at the ping-pong table seems a bit excessive in introducing her character, Scarlett Johansson plays Nola with sensual fervor and palpable emotionalism, especially as her character spirals into darker psychological territory. Their scenes together are surprisingly carnal for an Allen film. Since they carry out the greater themes of moral vacuity, the remaining actors seem to be there simply to support the other end of the spectrum though not in predictable ways. For example, Emily Mortimer manages to play the unsuspecting Chloe not as a victim but as someone unwilling to confront her own unhappiness given her aggressive and rather selfish desire to become pregnant.As embodied expertly by Brian Cox as the overly generous father, Penelope Wilton as the overbearing mother and Matthew Goode as carefree Tom, the rest of the Hewett family are equally clueless about what is going on around them. However, that's exactly Allen's point in his parable-like script as he makes shrewd observations about the power of luck and our profound inability to control our destinies in making one's way toward a desired life. In a manner that recalls Gordon Willis's work in Allen's ""Interiors"", Remi Adefarasin lends an immaculately cool sheen to the cinematography, and the upscale world among the London social elite is captured almost too adroitly with Jim Clay`s manicured production design and Caroline Smith's tasteful set decorations. In place of his usual jazz-infused soundtrack, Allen uses old opera recordings of Caruso singing Bizet, Donizetti, Rossini and especially Verdi as a smartly evocative background. This is strong work from the film auteur side of Allen well worth viewing.",4,"Luck and Fate at an Unlikely Crossroads in an Elegant, Crafty Movie by Woody Allen",1138492800,"01 29, 2006",2006,4016,"['true', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'had', 'erratic', 'record', 'filmmaker', 'late', 'are', 'definite', 'pleasures', 'be', 'had', 'recent', 'work', 'such', '1999', 'Sweet', 'Lowdown', '2000', 'Small', 'Time', 'Crooks', '2005', 'Melinda', 'Melinda', 'However', 'what', '2005', 'Match', 'Point', 'different', 'usual', 'Allen', 'product', 'incessantly', 'addictive', 'film', 'ripe', 'melodrama', 'suspense', 'little', 'Allen', 'angst-driven', 'comedy', 'are', 'elements', 'will', 'remind', 'long-time', 'Allen', 'aficionados', '1989', 'Crimes', 'Misdemeanors', '1993', 'Manhattan', 'Murder', 'Mystery', 'same', 'time', 'film', 'also', 'inspired', 'Anthony', 'Minghella', '1999', 'adaptation', 'Patricia', 'Highsmith', 'Talented', 'Mr.', 'Ripley', 'George', 'Stevens', '1951', 'Place', 'Sun', 'based', 'Theodore', 'Dreiser', 'American', 'Tragedy', 'Adrian', 'Lyne', '1987', 'Fatal', 'Attraction', '.Set', 'contemporary', 'London', 'first', 'Allen', 'intricate', 'plot', 'failed', 'pro', 'tennis', 'player', 'Chris', 'Wilton', 'who', 'rather', 'cushy', 'job', 'coach', 'fancy', 'private', 'club', 'sheer', 'luck', 'consistent', 'theme', 'Chris', 'wealthy', 'Tom', 'Hewett', 'way', 'evening', 'family', 'opera', 'box', 'dating', 'guileless', 'sister', 'Chloe', 'Insinuating', 'family', 'ease', 'including', 'securing', 'nice', 'job', 'one', 'companies', 'owned', 'Tom', 'Chloe', 'father', 'Chris', 'obsessed', 'Nola', 'Rice', 'Tom', 'seductive', 'American', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'failing', 'actress', 'whom', 'Tom', 'Chloe', 'mother', 'vehemently', 'How', 'intertwine', 'what', 'up', 'most', 'action', 'story', 'ever-tightening', 'noose', 'Chris', 'actions', 'Even', 'out', 'smart', 'thriller', 'Allen', 'decidedly', 'fatalistic', 'tone', 'greater', 'issues', 'fate', 'retribution', 'justice', 'themes', 'do', ""n't"", 'weigh', 'film', 'down', 'unnecessarily', 'fact', 'film', 'last', 'half-hour', 'brings', 'higher-level', 'issues', 'together', 'way', 'conclusion', 'resonate', 'unpredictable', 'force.As', 'Chris', 'Jonathan', 'Rhys-Meyers', 'effectively', 'opaque', 'manner', 'character', 'sympathetic', 'villainous', 'rather', 'precariously', 'off-balance', 'viewer', 'smartly', 'rendered', 'performance', 'teeters', 'predictable', 'only', 'very', 'end', 'first', 'scene', 'ping-pong', 'table', 'bit', 'excessive', 'introducing', 'character', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'Nola', 'sensual', 'fervor', 'palpable', 'emotionalism', 'especially', 'character', 'spirals', 'darker', 'psychological', 'territory', 'scenes', 'together', 'are', 'surprisingly', 'carnal', 'Allen', 'film', 'carry', 'out', 'greater', 'themes', 'moral', 'vacuity', 'remaining', 'actors', 'seem', 'be', 'there', 'simply', 'support', 'other', 'end', 'spectrum', 'not', 'predictable', 'ways', 'example', 'Emily', 'Mortimer', 'manages', 'play', 'unsuspecting', 'Chloe', 'not', 'victim', 'someone', 'unwilling', 'confront', 'own', 'unhappiness', 'given', 'aggressive', 'rather', 'selfish', 'desire', 'become', 'pregnant.As', 'embodied', 'expertly', 'Brian', 'Cox', 'overly', 'generous', 'father', 'Penelope', 'Wilton', 'overbearing', 'mother', 'Matthew', 'Goode', 'carefree', 'Tom', 'rest', 'Hewett', 'family', 'are', 'equally', 'clueless', 'what', 'going', 'However', 'exactly', 'Allen', 'point', 'parable-like', 'script', 'shrewd', 'observations', 'power', 'luck', 'profound', 'inability', 'control', 'destinies', 'making', 'one', 'way', 'desired', 'life', 'manner', 'Gordon', 'Willis', 'work', 'Allen', 'Interiors', 'Remi', 'Adefarasin', 'immaculately', 'cool', 'sheen', 'cinematography', 'upscale', 'world', 'London', 'social', 'elite', 'captured', 'almost', 'too', 'adroitly', 'Jim', 'Clay', 's', 'manicured', 'production', 'design', 'Caroline', 'Smith', 'tasteful', 'set', 'decorations', 'place', 'usual', 'jazz-infused', 'soundtrack', 'Allen', 'old', 'opera', 'recordings', 'Caruso', 'singing', 'Bizet', 'Donizetti', 'Rossini', 'especially', 'Verdi', 'smartly', 'evocative', 'background', 'strong', 'work', 'film', 'auteur', 'side', 'Allen', 'well', 'viewing']",Match Point

He meets Tom Hewitt, a wealthy young man whose common love of opera opens up a world of riches and high class mingling for the middle class Chris. Chris's luck starts to improve when Tom's sister Chloe falls in love with him, thus giving him opportunities for a lucrative career and a life of riches. When Chris meets Tom's fiance, Nola (played by the over-the-top sexy Scarlett Johanssen), he finds himself torn between his passion for the wealthy and proper Chloe and the pure lustful desire for Nola.When I found out that this movie was directed by Woody Allen, I figured that it would be obnoxiously funny or quirky. Turns out that I was wrong as hell. For a movie pegged as a drama, it is unbearably suspenseful and thought provoking. This film unfolds like a play, with the actors engaging in long dialogue and exquisitely portraying their characters. However, what makes this drama different is how the well-developed characters play a part in the suspense that occurrs as a result of Chris's descent into madness as the stress of having an affair with Nola takes a tragic toll on him.This movie was so excellent that I recommend it to everyone.

That's not really true.  Her demands are realistic.  In fact, although Chris is always playing the ""be realistic"" game with Nola, she has much more common sense than he does.  Many critics have said that Jonathan Rhys Meyers should have gotten a Oscar nomination, I disagree.  His acting is never convincing to me.  Scarlet Johansson on the other hand may have just been good enough to get one but even she was not great enough to win.  The story is interesting and the unrealistic ending works because it was artistically crafted, rather than just happening because the writer ran out of ideas.  The end in very disturbing and optimistic, which makes is even more disturbing in my opinion.  Rating wise, I am a little bit surprised that this film got a R rating.

Crimes and Misdemeanors, however, was a brilliant film more multi-layered, with more complex characterizations and containing the irony and wit of which Match Point is totally devoid. The plot and conflicts are universally recognizable but were drawn to better effect in many classic films of which A Place in the Sun comes to mind. In Match Point the iconography of Manhattan has been substituted for an idealized London; the social divides in both cities are the same, only the buildings and street names have been changed. The actors' performances are serviceable to the plot; no real acting ""wows"" here.

I cannot reveal the surprise ending; but I can point to a brief line of conversation in the movie thatnot only defines Mr Allen's fascination with a very dark side of our human nature, but also defines the age, the era, and  the moral malaise in which we have  all found ourselves. This is precisely what makes this movie and script a timeless classic that will be played in the next generation for what it reveals about all of us. This IS the definition of ""Art""....a visual image that accurately portrays, reveals, and identifies the particular fashions and social mores of a given culture in history. Just as we would look at an artifact and say, ""Oh this is from ancient Egypt"". Folks will one day pick up this movie and say ""Oh this was from ancient America""The conversation goes something like this: Rhys Myers is a tennis coach who finds himself catapulted into wealth thanks to the sweetest gal on earth, played by Emily Mortimer, who falls in love with him right off; and remains hapless and loyal, while Rhys himself is tragically attracted to the femme fatale in the script played by the comely Scarlett Johansson. Before this, however, it is revealed that Rhy's ..father?..""Lost his legs and found Jesus"". To which Rhy's future brother in law, the other poor little rich boy, brother of  classically sweet Emily...replies, apologetically, that ""It doesn't seem like a fair trade"".  It is then remarked , words to the effect, ""...that it is said that all life came about as an accident. That there is no right or wrong"".This is the literary epicenter around which this ill fated romance turns. But beyond that....it is the moral focal point around which the entire western world revolves. For this reason, this movie will be one that will be shown generations from now - which may well be used in classrooms to provide some clue as to ""What happened to the once great nation of America?

Although Match Point is Allen's first commercially and critically successful serious film, I miss the comedic aspects of his work. But I suppose that if he decides to occasionally produce serious film work of this quality, I will more than gladly hold my breath from time to time.But I can't help thinking that Crimes and Misdemeanors is the more accomplished film, in that it dares to mix serious subject matter (premeditated murder) with comedy. (But then, how many people have argued, quite effectively, that there is nothing more serious than comedy...?)Some people have argued that Match Point is the less preachy and the more subtle of the two films, but they don't seem to take into account that comedy typically attacks its targets in a very direct way and can't help coming off a bit preachy so much of the time.

I could relate to Chris, a man who previously had nothing and then suddenly thrust into a family where money is of no concern at all. Then comes along a woman who makes him question that. I think that aspect of the story is intriguing. However, my trouble with it is how stupidly it is resolved. I shaln't give away any details, but really! I though I was watching a different film of a different genre, and I did not care for that. I kept wondering when the saga would end, and I have to say by the end I was glad it was over. I was left confused, slightly let down, and also amused that such a good beginning to a film ended so mechanically.

High praise from both the critics and the audience alike only contributed to my impatience. What did I get? Allen recycled one of his own earlier masterpieces, used only a drama part of it and created a good-looking movie with myriads of references to the works of literature and cinema that had told the same story much better than he did this time. What is fascinating, the earlier masterpiece that I've mentioned above is twenty minutes shorter than ""Match Point"" but it had said so much more with such power that Allen himself was not able to recreate. Jonathan Rhys Meyers is not Martin Landau and Scarlet Johansson is not Angelica Huston. It is nothing wrong to borrow from himself but nothing original or compelling came from ""Match Point"". I enjoyed his silly ""Scoop"" and his dramedic ""Melinda & Melinda"" much better than his almost universally proclaimed as masterpiece ""Match Point"". I said once and I am repeating that Allen makes good, very good and excellent films. Let's say that I prefer his combination of drama and comedy to pure drama.

What we have here is a silly hodge podge of Crime and Punishment, Fatal Attraction, Titanic and Beverly Hills 90210.The only engaging, credible character is the brother-in-law how is a minor character serving only to establish a plot point. What is supposed to be alluring about the Johanssen character? A wealthy, charming British man of the caliber of Tom is going to fall in love at first sight with somebody who comes across as any random second year theater major in the United States? The whole movie hinges on the Johanssen character being an irresistable sex siren that any man would make any sacrifice to have. She's not worldly, she's not very articulate, she's attractive but not stunning. She's American and comes from an undistinguished family. That's just to add the irrelevant 'Titanic' subplot for the mother-in-law.The male lead is supposed to be Raskolnikov from Crime and Punishment. He wants to be the superman and ""do something important""? And that's supposed to manifest itself in reading Crime and Punishment on screen, going to the opera, taking an unspecified job in your father-in-law's generic, successful 'heavy hitter' corporation and then chasing around a blond Shannon Doherty behind your generic wife who can't get pregnant's back? I half expected them to be in a booth at the Peach Pit listing to opera on the jukebox.

MATCH POINT is a case in point. From the opening credits, to the keenly meaningful voice-over about the significance of luck in molding the course of our lives, to the arresting pause of a tennis ball frozen in its rise from a struck net before falling to either side, to the use of scratchy Enrico Caruso recordings  - all of these are indications that Allen is about to lead us into a world defined by walking on razor blade edges.  Match Point is an intelligent, burnished, glowing little masterpiece of movie making, a thriller that keeps the viewer bound until the surprise ending.Chris (Jonathan Rhys Meyers, groomed and handsome and magnetic in his first role as a non-quirky oddball) is a lower middle class ex tennis pro who begins his new life as a tennis teacher in a wealthy club where he encounters the Hewett family, a family of immense wealth lead by a benevolent father (Brian Cox), a class conscious mother (Penelope Wilton), a handsome son Tom (Matthew Goode) who is dating a middle class American wannabe actress Nola (Scarlett Johansson), and daughter Chloe (Emily Mortimer).  Chris' good looks and manners win the family's affection and he is melded into the fabric of wealth through his attention to Chloe and his movement into the father's business. Sadly for all Chris is attracted to the sensuous Nola who, despite her physical attraction for Chris, knows the steps to climb up the ladder to wealth by being engaged to Tom.Chris falls in love with his new life of luxury, marries Chloe who wants to have children immediately, and yet he lusts for Nola.  In time Nola and Tom part (the reason to be outlined later in the film) and though hesitant to shake Chris' marriage to Chloe, Nola becomes physically involved with Chris.  The inherent dangers of Chris' infidelity grow to tragic proportions and his knotty dilemma of choosing his new life of comfort versus his lust for Nola result in bits and pieces of luck that determine the outcome of the film.For this viewer it is difficult to fault any aspect of this film: the cinematography by Remi Adefarasin is not only stunning visually - it also captures the tension of the film in mixing tight shots with panoramas isolating the characters in motion of betrayal;  the film's music score is almost entirely opera excerpts from old Caruso recordings (know the opera excerpts and the story is enhanced!) and from 'live' stage performances at Covent Garden (superb singing and staging oddly accompanied by only a piano!).  But the brilliance of this ensemble is Allen's keenly sensitive eye and timing and pacing of a suspense thriller that always has as its base a fine dollop of social comment and lusty romance.  The cast is impeccable, from the consistently superb smaller roles to the tour de force acting of Jonathan Rhys Meyers, Scarlett Johansson, and Emily Mortimer.  This is clearly one of the finest works of Woody Allen's long career and hopefully he will continue along this vein.  Highly Recommended.

977609,ANIMV3SPDD8SH,B000EQHXNW,Guy De Federicis,"[1, 3]","The same buzz. Woody Allen's new film debuts at Cannes. It is said to be a return to form. It has critic's drooling. It is Hitchcockian. Stop. It is being nominated for numerous awards. STOP!My first reaction - just about the worst title for a film about a tennis teacher. My second reaction, how can you take the strong backbone subplot of (Allen's) ""Crimes and Misdemeanors"", and use it as the singular thrust of a new film? You can't, Mr. Allen. That film left an incredible impression on me and you musn't tamper with it.Not unless you do it quite perfectly. You can hammer it home again. You can make me feel that I haven't returned from a movie theatre but from an art gallery, showcasing a stunning, but depressing new exhibit. After viewing ""Match Point"", I'm not strolling along with a renewal of life, wishing for a Manhatten weekend, chuckling to myself, no, I'm dragging a guilty heart for hoping, for even a moment, that the fortunate son-of-a-gun in this film gets away with his crime. I momentarily understood the mindset of an unwilling accomplice. When tragedy befell a character in Allen's ""Bullets Over Broadway"", the loss and exit of a hysterically funny performance was felt as if someone had really died. And in ""Crimes and Misdemeanors"" all I could think was, ...yes, yes, people are probably like that. Here, the bottom falls out competely. There's no brushing shoulders with those with little regard for human life. We are as insecure as the tennis ball wobbling atop the net, as alike as the trapped rat defending his space.The pretty lipped lead, Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, is pretty impressive, and Scarlett Johansson, so vital, genuine, and sexual here, proves herself in all sorts of ways. Woody Allen has delivered us a cold slap in the face, and maybe we need to be reminded how badly people can suck. ""Match Point"" is a disturbing thud to the heart. I'm in the movieplex lobby, as the real world falls back into place, and the tinge of guilt I feel is complimented only slightly by the sudden rationale realization, that I don't think anything, could have me buy a ticket, and enjoy, a gay Harlequin romance about cowboys.",4,SET,1138492800,"01 29, 2006",2006,2150,"['same', 'buzz', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'new', 'film', 'debuts', 'Cannes', 'said', 'be', 'return', 'form', 'critic', 'drooling', 'Hitchcockian', 'Stop', 'being', 'nominated', 'numerous', 'awards', 'STOP', 'first', 'reaction', 'just', 'worst', 'title', 'film', 'tennis', 'teacher', 'second', 'reaction', 'how', 'can', 'take', 'strong', 'backbone', 'subplot', 'Allen', 'Crimes', 'Misdemeanors', 'use', 'singular', 'thrust', 'new', 'film', 'ca', ""n't"", 'Mr.', 'Allen', 'film', 'left', 'incredible', 'impression', 'mus', ""n't"", 'tamper', 'it.Not', 'do', 'quite', 'perfectly', 'can', 'hammer', 'home', 'again', 'can', 'make', 'feel', 'have', ""n't"", 'returned', 'movie', 'theatre', 'art', 'gallery', 'showcasing', 'stunning', 'depressing', 'new', 'exhibit', 'viewing', 'Match', 'Point', ""'m"", 'not', 'strolling', 'along', 'renewal', 'life', 'wishing', 'Manhatten', 'weekend', 'chuckling', ""'m"", 'dragging', 'guilty', 'heart', 'hoping', 'even', 'moment', 'fortunate', 'son-of-a-gun', 'film', 'away', 'crime', 'momentarily', 'understood', 'mindset', 'unwilling', 'accomplice', 'When', 'tragedy', 'befell', 'character', 'Allen', 'Bullets', 'Broadway', 'loss', 'exit', 'hysterically', 'funny', 'performance', 'was', 'felt', 'someone', 'had', 'really', 'died', 'Crimes', 'Misdemeanors', 'could', 'think', 'was', 'yes', 'yes', 'people', 'are', 'probably', 'Here', 'bottom', 'out', 'competely', 'brushing', 'shoulders', 'little', 'regard', 'human', 'life', 'are', 'as', 'insecure', 'tennis', 'ball', 'wobbling', 'net', 'as', 'alike', 'trapped', 'rat', 'defending', 'space.The', 'pretty', 'lipped', 'lead', 'Jonathan', 'Rhys-Meyers', 'pretty', 'impressive', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'vital', 'genuine', 'sexual', 'here', 'sorts', 'ways', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'delivered', 'cold', 'slap', 'face', 'maybe', 'need', 'be', 'reminded', 'how', 'badly', 'people', 'can', 'suck', 'Match', 'Point', 'disturbing', 'thud', 'heart', ""'m"", 'movieplex', 'lobby', 'real', 'world', 'back', 'place', 'tinge', 'guilt', 'feel', 'complimented', 'only', 'slightly', 'sudden', 'rationale', 'realization', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'anything', 'could', 'have', 'buy', 'ticket', 'enjoy', 'gay', 'Harlequin', 'romance', 'cowboys']",Match Point

I went into this thinking it would be a ""Closer"" like film--and though I do see the similarities in tone and feel--this film is different in it's own right. Has any reviewer ever read any tragic plays of Sophlocles? This reminds me of a Sophlocles play (indeed--the end has a magnificent quote from the man by the main character). The film does a good job at foreshadowing events to come by interspersing little hints throughout the film. Te ending is not a ""shock"" as everyone says but almost a logical conclusion in terms of classic tragedy. Many people will dislike this film, but I think that if one looks at it like one looks at an opera (which is a key aspect of the film) or tragic literature, then it will become a familiar yet unique experience. No film has ever been able to capture the tragedy of plays that i've seen--this comes very close.The only reason I have not given this film 5 stars is the fact that the film did not give me any sort of revelation. The films that are worth five stars are ones that you can take away from constantly throughout your entire life. I have a feeling that the reason I have not felt that it applies to my life all that much is that I am still young and have not truly felt the tragedy of love and reality. However,  the film certainly impacted me and I will be coming back to it to think about little subtleties.

Bridell ""Lost Johnny""","[2, 3]","There can be no doubt that Woody Allen is a talented filmmaker, but there can also be no doubt that his last few films have been tragic missteps (although I liked ""Anything Else"").  Mr. Allen is back in true form with this off the wall British potboiler about wealth, privilege and how a man can become a monster.  Yes a monster, like Hannibal Lechter (spelling)? We see the devil is a gentleman; at least he starts out that way.  A man becomes evil when he A. Gives in to temptation even at risk to his and other peoples well being. B. When he continues this risky/dangerous behavior after he knows he should not, a habit can become an addiction and the monster cares not. C. He chooses to do great evil rather then face  his own demons, great evil being to do irreparable harm to people who have done nothing to him and do not, by any means, deserve there fate. The monster may even feel bad about it, but he is a monster first and he feels he was forced to do it.  This sounds weird but that's how I see Match Point.  The main character is a decent if flawed person who has incredible luck, he is more then lucky and turns his good fortune into better fortune, he sees temptation and gives in like a drug addict or problem gambler, he refuses to deal with his behavior even when he sees it will be his undoing, when all seems lost he has a choice and his choice is a monstrous one.  There is a macabre fascination with watching this film a second or third time, we can see the tragic tale unfolding, the scratchy opera soundtrack lets us know that tragedy is coming (and I don't know an opera from a pop tart). But this is not a tragedy like an earthquake or fire; this is the tragedy of an opera where people do great evil to each other.  The film is so predictable in the first and second act's that when it takes a hard left in the third act we are truly shocked and the ending (I will not give away the ending as it would ruin the film) is as cynical and monstrous as the events themselves.  This is a quiet, well-made shocker, which I can watch, over and over again and see new things.

His films contain ironic humor and great dialog that you cannot help but admire this 70-year-old funny little man.""Match Point"" represents a different kind of Allen because his known set Manhattan/New York has changed to rainy London. Allen expands his views, and the result is one working combination of new locations charm and variety. That fact made ""Match Point"" even more likable.The irony was there but instead of raving comedy he gave us some completely different. ""Match Point"" is a story about love, passion and coincidence. Ex-tennis professional Chris Wilton (Jonathan Rhys-Myers) gets caught up with intriguing affair with his brother's bride Nola Rice (Scarlett Johansson). New heat is more interesting than his life with his wife Chloe (doll-faced Emily Mortimer.

977630,A1L1ANYK643HD9,B000EQHXNW,Jeremiah Mcneil,"[7, 13]","There exists an erroneous notion among the majority of the aesthetic audience that great artists will inevitably produce great works. However, upon close examination of the careers of those few considered to be masters, one must note that in only the rarest cases do artists experience unencumbered access to the greatest reaches of their talents. ""The House of Mirth"" and ""The Age of Innocence"" stand out almost like flukes in the career of Edith Wharton; Eugene O'Neill produced two or three ""Emporer Jones""es for every ""The Iceman Cometh,"" and ""Long Day's Journey Into Night"" remains singular among his works; twenty years passed between Kurosawa's ""Throne of Blood"" and his ""Kagemusha."" Is there any doubt, then, that Woody Allen can be considered a great artist?If there exists such doubt, ""Match Point"" should dispel it. This rich and complex moral tale is woven in the fine, subtle threads of a great novel. It explicates its themes in frank but poetic observations: the fall of a tennis ball caught in the net becomes the very notion of chance; a jarring painting displays a woman's inner life. Allen is in full form here, writing characters whose tastes and actions say much more about them than they'd ever say about themselves, and guiding actors to inject into each character an inner life, displayed in fleeting glances and tilts of the head. Like a great novel, ""Match Point"" contains not a word misplaced; it manages to fully evoke characters and themes without ever seeming forced or heavy handed.Allen framed his recent film ""Melinda and Melinda"" around an argument over the relative qualities of tragedy and comedy in art, telling his story twice with minor changes meant to illustrate those forms. ""Match Point"" is a similarly illustrative tale: this one is meant to demostrate that life is governed by chance. It is an informal affair, not at all prescriptive- Allen does not attempt to prove anything, save within the confines of his tale. Thus ""Match Point"" is a culmination of his work not only in ""Melinda and Melinda,"" but also ""Crimes and Misdemeanors""- the work in Allen's ouvre whose theme ""Match Point"" most clearly echoes. It is, however, a more mature work than either, as it neither explicates its own intentions nor offers its themes as an argument; it doesn't tell, it shows, and never has the old addage about how to make a movie been more right.Having thus argued for the film a a compliment to Allen's canon, all that remains is to look at it singularly. ""Match Point"" is a Dreiserian melodrama composed with the musical clarity of top-form Scott Fitzgerald. It tells of a thoroughly Fitzgeraldian protagonist- a directionless man prone to extravegance and dissipation- meeting and being assimilated into an effete capitalist aristocracy. Chris is the sort of young man who begrudges not being able to pick up a tab, and yet never picks one up. Born poor in Ireland, he has gone to the limit of his only known talent- tennis- and been found wanting. While dating the sister of the man who pays his bills he meets that man's fiancee, the similarly coddled American actress Nola, and seeing in her a bit of his mercenary self (coupled with the body of Scarlett Johansson), he is instantly smitten. The two embark on a sensuous affair that threatens Chris's increasingly comfortable lifestyle; much devilish duplicity ensues. Jonathan Rhys Meyers, Chris, has an incredible sensuousness in his face and demeanor, and uses it to convey his character's crass materialism vividly. He imbues Chris, an increasingly despicable person, with enough emotion to make him the object of empathy- no small feat. Johansson makes Nola, a character simultaneously aware of, and willing to use, her impact on men and yet still quite reserved about doing so, believable- she invests her character with a much-needed sincerity. Emily Mortimer, as Chris's girlfriend and later wife Chloe, is both vivacious and kind, both sweet and needy. She is the film's most easily empathizable character, but one no less difficult to grasp than Chris or Nola, and Mortimer does a fantastic job. And, as is usual with an Allen film, the cinematography is superb and the staging very natural. Opera is used as knowingly and as comfortably as ever jazz was in an Allen film. Altogether, Allen and his cast and crew create a world that is both lived-in and breathable. The scenes of seduction are infused with an eroticism heretofore largely absent in Allen's work, and the dialogue rolls off the actors' tongues like off-screen conversation- there is none of Allen's schtick here, nor is there any of his sometimes stagey formalism. ""Match Point"" is both intellectually engaging and tremendously entertaining, like the work of Fitzgerald or Dostoevsky. It is realism in its purest, most rewarding form.Woody Allen has submitted his masterpiece in ""Match Point."" It recalls themes long embedded in his work, but synthesizes them into an altogether realistic and altogether original film. There is no precedent for ""Match Point"" in Allen's canon. While ""Annie Hall,"" ""Hannah and Her Sisters,"" ""The Purple Rose of Cairo,"" and, arguably, ""Manhattan"" and ""Bullets Over Broadway"" are classics, Allen has stepped outside his traditional technique here to both validate them as classics and repudiate them as immature, by showing precisely what else he is capable of creating. Let us now lay any remaining doubt of Allen's genius to rest. ""Match Point"" is proof that Woody Allen is an artist of the highest order.",5,Woody Allen Submits a Masterpiece,1159401600,"09 28, 2006",2006,5504,"['erroneous', 'notion', 'majority', 'aesthetic',

Rooney,"[0, 0]","Woody Allen in his long sojourn to London found a new genre for him, the suspense lust thriller, when he wrote and directed the superb film ""Match Point"" (2005) He also developed there the thriller ""Cassandra's Dream"" with Colin Farrell. With brilliant photography and gorgeous scenes of London he depicts the life of a tennis semi-pro Chris (Jonathan Rhys Meyers), a handsome devil with sensual lips, who volleys himself into a life of wealth married to Chloe, the daughter of a moneyed family presided over by father Brian Cox in a thankless role.Chris is introduced into the family by a young man, Tom, something of a cad and a wastrel, to whom he's giving tennis lessons. The wealthy scion has a stunning girlfriend, Nola, (again with sensuous lips) a would-be actress (Scarlett Johansson). Unfortunately for Chris he falls insanely in love with the money-poor Nola.His dilemma: Nola gets with child and wants Chris to leave wife Chloe. Danger! Danger! Danger! What is newly rich Chris going to do? Chris is a striver from Ireland who hasn't seen better days yet. At the beginning of the movie Chris is reading ""Crime and Punishment."" He and Nola are two of a kind, both schemers and opportunists. Nola says, ""You'll do very good for yourself unless you blow it."" Nola keeps a diary which chronicles her passionate affair with Chris.Most of the movie is taken up with the smoldering passions of Chris and Nola and his devious tricks to find time with his mistress. Suspense, Hitchcockian, keeps building in the film. Her neighbor, that staple of the West End stage, Margaret Tyzack, gets a quick view of Chris. Chris says, ""Faith is the path of least resistance.""The soundtrack has arias from famous operas, often old scratchy ones, that provide a brilliant backdrop to the action and maneuvering of Chris. The ending is full of twists and turns and some really clever bits. Luck plays an important role in Chris's life.One character at the end quotes Sophocles, ""To never having been born may have been the greatest boon of all.""With this movie Woody Allen opened up new territory and gave us a fine motion picture.",5,Woody Allen Outdoes Hitchcock,1247529600,"07 14, 2009",2009,2120,"['Woody', 'Allen', 'long', 'sojourn', 'London', 'found', 'new', 'genre', 'suspense', 'lust', 'thriller', 'when', 'wrote', 'directed', 'superb', 'film', 'Match', 'Point', '2005', 'also', 'developed', 'thriller', 'Cassandra', 'Dream', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'brilliant', 'photography', 'gorgeous', 'scenes', 'London', 'life', 'tennis', 'semi-pro', 'Chris', 'Jonathan', 'Rhys', 'Meyers', 'handsome', 'devil', 'sensual', 'lips', 'who', 'volleys', 'life', 'wealth', 'married', 'Chloe', 'daughter', 'moneyed', 'family', 'presided', 'over', 'father', 'Brian', 'Cox', 'thankless', 'role.Chris', 'introduced', 'family', 'young', 'man', 'Tom', 'something', 'cad', 'wastrel', 'whom', 'giving', 'tennis', 'lessons', 'wealthy', 'scion', 'stunning', 'girlfriend', 'Nola', 'again', 'sensuous', 'lips', 'would-be', 'actress', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'Unfortunately', 'Chris', 'insanely', 'love', 'money-poor', 'Nola.His', 'dilemma', 'Nola', 'child', 'Chris', 'leave', 'wife', 'Chloe', 'Danger', 'Danger', 'Danger', 'What', 'newly', 'rich', 'Chris', 'going', 'do', 'Chris', 'striver', 'Ireland', 'who', ""n't"", 'seen', 'better', 'days', 'yet', 'beginning', 'movie', 'Chris', 'reading', 'Crime', 'Punishment', 'Nola', 'are', 'two', 'kind', 'schemers', 'opportunists', 'Nola', ""'ll"", 'do', 'very', 'good', 'blow', 'Nola', 'diary', 'passionate', 'affair', 'Chris.Most', 'movie', 'taken', 'up', 'smoldering', 'passions', 'Chris', 'Nola', 'devious', 'tricks', 'find', 'time', 'mistress', 'Suspense', 'Hitchcockian', 'building', 'film', 'neighbor', 'staple', 'West', 'End', 'stage', 'Margaret', 'Tyzack', 'quick', 'view', 'Chris', 'Chris', 'Faith', 'path', 'least', 'resistance', 'soundtrack', 'arias', 'famous', 'operas', 'often', 'old', 'scratchy', 'ones', 'provide', 'brilliant', 'backdrop', 'action', 'maneuvering', 'Chris', 'ending', 'full', 'twists', 'turns', 'really', 'clever', 'bits', 'Luck', 'important', 'role', 'Chris', 'life.One', 'character', 'end', 'Sophocles', 'never', 'having', 'been', 'born', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'greatest', 'boon', 'movie', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'opened', 'up', 'new', 'territory', 'gave', 'fine', 'motion', 'picture']",Match Point

Also his language for the British has a strong american flavor.  The movie was a half hour too long.  Like someone else said, it dragged, though not in the middle, but at the begining.  Chris' divided emotions could have been shown in about 10 minutes, and I wish they had been.  The rest of the movie, though, was a knock out.  Another review said there was very little music in it.  The damn thing was loaded with music.  Opera was the background music, just as Tin Pan Alley made up the soundtrack for ""Bullets Over Broadway.""  Because in this flick, all the main characters were opera buffs.  Me, too.  And I thought it was clever.  Along with other things, Allen has a  genius for picking his soundtracks.  Yes.  It's similar in some ways to ""Crimes and Misdemeanors.""  Particularly in its cynicism, though Crimes was more cynical.  I didn't see the hero in this movie as a bad man.  More like a trapped one.  In a nod to Bergman (?), the hero at the start of the flick is reading ""Crime and Punishment,"" then as another person pointed out, looking up what he's read in a ""what does it really mean"" type reference.  Except that that particular Dostoyevsky isn't all that hard to understand, and as the plot discloses, our hero is not that stupid.  Not at all.  I thought I was going to quit and throw it away during the 1st 30 or 45 minutes, then it got going.  I wish it had been Allen's (and Bergman's) usual 82 minutes long.  I think if it had been, I would consider it (with ""Annie Hall"") Allen's best movie.  With the qualifications already mentioned.  Finally, as for it's being a ""thriller,"" you have to wait for that, and I almost called the blurb a fraud and chucked it.  Glad I didn't.

977636,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B000EQHXNW,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[4, 5]","I've never liked Woody Allen. Even if I saw a movie by him that I liked, it was only a vague liking and had nothing to do with Allen. I liked ""Mighty Aphrodite"" but that was because of Mira Sorvino and ""Sweet and Lowdown"" was good, but had a lot of faults. I've never seen any of his ""good movies"" like Annie Hall as it turns out, so maybe he's better than I thought. Here is Woody Allen's first movie that is not set in New York and doesn't even mention New York; It's unlike any other Woody Allen movie but it still has the Woody Allen look and feel. The weird music and the way it's filmed, etc. The movie features a great cast (which is usually abundant in Allen's films) and it features Jonathan Rhys Meyers, Emily Mortimer, Scarlett Johansson, and Brian Cox. The movie takes a few minutes to achieve it's balance and once it does, it's pure entertainment. It's smart, it's got style, great acting, and a good script. The dialouge is also very good and I don't know if I'd consider the film ""noir"" as it's been called by a few people. But, anyway. Rhys Meyers, in a really good performance, plays Chris. Chris is a tennis pro who meets two very different woman through his friend Tom.He meets Tom's sister Chloe (Mortimer) and Tom's fiancee Nola (Johansson). Chloe is sweet and loving and will bring Tom success and fortune. Nola is sensuous, gorgeous, and exciting. Well, Chris marries Chloe and Tom breaks up with Nola. After a chance meeting, Chris meets Nola again and the two begin an affair. I had read the reviews for this movie and had read about the twist at the end of the movie. After about an hour into this movie, I thought I had it pegged. Allen then turns the tables and a few unexpected things happen. Once again, you think you have it pegged when in the final moments Allen throws a curveball. I like how the very beginning of the movie sets up what's to happen at the end. The movie has some great scenes, the first scene in the bar with Chris and Nola is really good. The dialouge here is just spectacular. One viewer complained that the first scene in the bar was brilliant with sexual innuendo's flying everywhere, but when you reach the next bar scene it's reduced to ""Can I buy you a drink?"" This isn't a lack of creativity on Allen's part, it's meant to show how the relationship between Nola and Chris has changed. The scene with the ring is well filmed and I love the ending, although it's not ""one of the best endings in recent years"" or anything. I also want to bring up Johansson's performance. She's a great actress, but takes a lot of roles where she doesn't really get to show us how good she is (The Island for example). So this is a nice change of pace for her. Also, just as a side note for Johansson fans, there is no nudity in this film whatsoever. It comes close once or twice, but that's it. But, anyway, this is probably one of Allen's best films and it's certainly a triumph after a series of movies which have tanked both commerically and critically.GRADE: A-",5,The Best Woody Allen Movie in a Long Time,1146096000,"04 27, 2006",2006,3006,"[""'ve"", 'never', 'liked', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'Even', 'saw', 'movie', 'liked', 'was', 'only', 'vague', 'liking', 'had', 'nothing', 'do', 'Allen', 'liked', 'Mighty', 'Aphrodite', 'was', 'Mira', 'Sorvino', 'Sweet', 'Lowdown', 'was', 'good', 'had', 'lot', 'faults', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'good', 'movies', 'Annie', 'Hall', 'out', 'so', 'maybe', 'better', 'thought', 'Here', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'first', 'movie', 'not', 'set', 'New', 'York', ""n't"", 'even', 'mention', 'New', 'York', 'other', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'movie', 'still', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'look', 'feel', 'weird', 'music', 'way', 'filmed', 'etc', 'movie', 'great', 'cast', 'usually', 'abundant', 'Allen', 'films', 'Jonathan', 'Rhys', 'Meyers', 'Emily', 'Mortimer', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'Brian', 'Cox', 'movie', 'few', 'minutes', 'achieve', 'balance', 'once', 'pure', 'entertainment', 'smart', 'got', 'style', 'great', 'acting', 'good', 'script', 'dialouge', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', ""'d"", 'consider', 'film', 'noir', 'been', 'called', 'few', 'people', 'anyway', 'Rhys', 'Meyers', 'really', 'good', 'performance', 'Chris', 'Chris', 'tennis', 'pro', 'who', 'two', 'very', 'different', 'woman', 'friend', 'Tom.He', 'Tom', 'sister', 'Chloe', 'Mortimer', 'Tom', 'fiancee', 'Nola', 'Johansson', 'Chloe', 'sweet', 'loving', 'will', 'bring', 'Tom', 'success', 'fortune', 'Nola', 'sensuous', 'gorgeous', 'exciting', 'Well', 'Chris', 'Chloe', 'Tom', 'up', 'Nola', 'chance', 'meeting', 'Chris', 'Nola', 'again', 'two', 'begin', 'affair', 'had', 'read', 'reviews', 'movie', 'had', 'read', 'twist', 'end', 'movie', 'hour', 'movie', 'thought', 'had', 'pegged', 'Allen', 'then', 'tables', 'few', 'unexpected', 'things', 'happen', 'Once', 'again', 'think', 'have', 'pegged', 'when', 'final', 'moments', 'Allen', 'curveball', 'how', 'very', 'beginning', 'movie', 'up', 'what', 'happen', 'end', 'movie', 'great', 'scenes', 'first', 'scene', 'bar', 'Chris', 'Nola', 'really', 'good', 'dialouge', 'here', 'just', 'spectacular', 'One', 'viewer', 'complained', 'first', 'scene', 'bar', 'was', 'brilliant', 'sexual', 'innuendo', 'flying', 'everywhere', 'when', 'reach', 'next', 'bar', 'scene', 'reduced', 'Can', 'buy', 'drink', ""n't"", 'lack', 'creativity', 'Allen', 'part', 'meant', 'show', 'how', 'relationship', 'Nola', 'Chris', 'changed', 'scene', 'ring', 'well', 'filmed', 'love', 'ending', 'not', 'one', 'best', 'endings', 'recent', 'years', 'anything', 'also', 'want', 'bring', 'up', 'Johansson', 'performance', 'great', 'actress', 'lot', 'roles', 'where', ""n't"", 'really', 'get', 'show', 'how', 'good', 'Island', 'example', 'nice', 'change', 'pace', 'Also', 'just', 'side', 'note', 'Johansson', 'fans', 'nudity', 'film', 'whatsoever', 'close', 'once', 'twice', 'anyway', 'probably', 'one', 'Allen', 'best', 'films', 'certainly', 'triumph', 'series', 'movies', 'have', 'tanked', 'commerically', 'critically.GRADE', 'A-']",Match Point

977640,A11RDKJK0VCA0K,B000EQHXNW,katherine,"[13, 17]","This film was heralded as Woody Allen's comeback though it's hard to see why. I know many people loved it which was why I was excited to see it but it's such a disappointment. Match Point opens fairly strongly with Chris Wilton (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers) applying for a position as a tennis instructor at a ritzy country club. He's hired. One of his pupils is Tom Hewlett, the playboy son of a wealthy family. The two hit it off (they both share a love of opera). Tom invites Chris to join him for an opera performance with his family, and thus Chris is inducted into the high society Britain. He meets, Chloe, Chris's sister who falls instantly in love with him. It seems that Chris is about to find himself in an exceedingly comfortable lifestyle. The movie springs along until Tom's finace Nola (Scarlett Johansson) arrives. Chris and Nola two start an ill-advised romance and it's trouble from there on out.The characters, although played by exceedingly attractive young actors, fail to grab your attention. The actors fail to convey the depth necessary for the roles. Scarlett johanssan, who's portrayal was heralded, particularly disappointed me by how awful she was. Although she looks the part, she's too self-conscious. I could see her trying to be sexy and jaded throughout the entire movie. Rhys-Meyers fares slightly better. There are moments where he oozes charm and one can see why the Hewletts are instantly drawn to him. Yet in somber moments he too seems be forcing it.Then there's the plot...in this type of movie, the plot matters. And in the last third of this movie the plot is so full of holes...well you'll have to see for yourself but I cannot understand how people could rave about this movie given what happens. Even if the previous parts had been decent it would not have made up for the mess of the last third.The movie is stylish without a doubt. And the premise of it was promising, but the execution was clumsy. The acting by the leads (Johansson and Rhys-Meyers) was second rate, though I suspect that may be more the director's fault because I have seen them act better in other roles; the supporting cast was able if not particularly noteworthy.",2,comeback? more like overrated,1151193600,"06 25, 2006",2006,2175,"['film', 'was', 'heralded', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'comeback', 'hard', 'see', 'why', 'know', 'many', 'people', 'loved', 'was', 'why', 'was', 'excited', 'see', 'such', 'disappointment', 'Match', 'Point', 'fairly', 'strongly', 'Chris', 'Wilton', 'Jonathan', 'Rhys-Meyers', 'applying', 'position', 'tennis', 'instructor', 'ritzy', 'country', 'club', 'hired', 'One', 'pupils', 'Tom', 'Hewlett', 'playboy', 'son', 'wealthy', 'family', 'two', 'hit', 'off', 'share', 'love', 'opera', 'Tom', 'Chris', 'join', 'opera', 'performance', 'family', 'thus', 'Chris', 'inducted', 'high', 'society', 'Britain', 'Chloe', 'Chris', 'sister', 'who', 'instantly', 'love', 'Chris', 'find', 'exceedingly', 'comfortable', 'lifestyle', 'movie', 'springs', 'Tom', 'finace', 'Nola', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'Chris', 'Nola', 'two', 'start', 'ill-advised', 'romance', 'trouble', 'there', 'out.The', 'characters', 'played', 'exceedingly', 'attractive', 'young', 'actors', 'fail', 'grab', 'attention', 'actors', 'fail', 'convey', 'depth', 'necessary', 'roles', 'Scarlett', 'johanssan', 'who', 'portrayal', 'was', 'heralded', 'particularly', 'disappointed', 'how', 'awful', 'was', 'part', 'too', 'self-conscious', 'could', 'see', 'trying', 'be', 'sexy', 'jaded', 'entire', 'movie', 'Rhys-Meyers', 'fares', 'slightly', 'better', 'are', 'moments', 'where', 'charm', 'one', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'Hewletts', 'are', 'instantly', 'drawn', 'somber', 'moments', 'too', 'be', 'forcing', 'plot', 'type', 'movie', 'plot', 'matters', 'last', 'third', 'movie', 'plot', 'so', 'full', 'holes', 'well', ""'ll"", 'have', 'see', 'can', 'not', 'understand', 'how', 'people', 'could', 'rave', 'movie', 'given', 'what', 'Even', 'previous', 'parts', 'had', 'been', 'decent', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'made', 'up', 'mess', 'last', 'third.The', 'movie', 'stylish', 'doubt', 'premise', 'was', 'promising', 'execution', 'was', 'clumsy', 'acting', 'leads', 'Johansson', 'Rhys-Meyers', 'was', 'second', 'rate', 'suspect', 'may', 'be', 'more', 'director', 'fault', 'have', 'seen', 'act', 'better', 'other', 'roles', 'supporting', 'cast', 'was', 'able', 'not', 'particularly', 'noteworthy']",Match Point
977641,A27CHILBK6HIL2,B000EQHXNW,Kaya Savas,"[33, 36]","MOVIE: Do you ever sit and watch a movie and try and guess the ending? Do you ever try and guess what direction a film is going? Well, I dare you to try and guess this film's outcome, go ahead, I dare you. Match Point is Woody Allen's character study as to how luck plays a role in our lives. Match Point opens appropriately enough with a sideline view of a tennis ball going back and forth across the net in slow motion. The narrator is the voice of the main character, Chris, played by Jonathan Rhys-Meyers. He describes the game of tennis as luck, that once in a while the ball will hit the net. The frame then freezes as the ball hits the net, and he describes that luck determines which side of the net the ball will fall. Chris, who is an all-pro tennis player, decides to step down from playing and takes up teaching for awhile while he decides what he wants to do with his life. His latest student, Tom, shares a passion of opera with him and invites him to his family's balcony seats. There he meets Tom's sister, and he falls in love with her. However, he soon meets Nola, a beautiful woman who lures him in with her eyes. He soon finds out that Nola is Tom's soon to be wife. This is the film as it seems. Chris begins to have an affair with Nola, and after she breaks up with Tom they continue to romance without the knowledge of Tom's family. He gets married to Tom's sister and they are now expecting a child, his father in-law lands him a dream job at one of his corporations. Yet, it is still the lure of the temptress that calls to him. Woddy Allen sets up a dilemma for our main character that raises the question between love and lust, and luck and fate. While you may expect this film to be lustful drama, you have no idea where Allen takes you next. The brilliant aspect of the film, is that there is no score. I hate films without a score, I think music is 50% of a film's emotional effect on the audience, but where there is no original score there is opera. Allen uses opera to structure the scenes, since it is the one thing that ties Chris to the family. The opera changes in tone and emotion as the scene does, so it works to perfection. The film is interesting, you may find yourself debating about what happens in the end, but you realize it all ties in with what this movie is about. The film plot is something that you'd expect from Hitchcock, and it is a savory one at that. The movie is entertaining and thought provoking even if it doesn't seem plausible at times.ACTING: Jonathan Rhys-Meyers does a superb job even though I think some of his dialogue seems stilted, but he's not to blame for that. He does a fantatsic job with what Woody Allen gives him. Scarlett Johansson is perfectly cast as the temptress, and she even gives her somewhat commercial character a human side as well. Great acting, even though the dialogue is stilted at times.BOTTOM LINE: The film will lead you one way only to make a sharp left and take you where you wouldn't expect. You have no idea what's coming, and I dare you to guess the ending before it starts to unfold. The film is intelligent and an interesting watch, but it really doesn't boast any technical highlights. Cinematography is nothing to get excited over, but it's one doozy of a screenplay.",5,Woody Allen's Character Piece Holds Hitchcockian Qualities & A Turning Point You Won't See Coming,1137542400,"01 18, 2006",2006,3270,"['MOVIE', 'Do', 'ever', 'sit', 'watch', 'movie', 'try', 'guess', 'ending', 'Do', 'ever', 'try', 'guess', 'what', 'direction', 'film', 'going', 'Well', 'dare', 'try', 'guess', 'film', 'outcome', 'go', 'ahead', 'dare', 'Match', 'Point', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'character', 'study', 'how', 'luck', 'role', 'lives', 'Match', 'Point', 'appropriately', 'enough', 'sideline', 'view', 'tennis', 'ball', 'going', 'back', 'forth', 'net', 'slow', 'motion', 'narrator', 'voice', 'main', 'character', 'Chris', 'played', 'Jonathan', 'Rhys-Meyers', 'game', 'tennis', 'luck', 'once', 'ball', 'will', 'hit', 'net', 'frame', 'then', 'ball', 'net', 'luck', 'determines', 'side', 'net', 'ball', 'will', 'fall', 'Chris', 'who', 'all-pro', 'tennis', 'player', 'step', 'down', 'playing', 'up', 'teaching', 'awhile', 'what', 'do', 'life', 'latest', 'student', 'Tom', 'shares', 'passion', 'opera', 'family', 'balcony', 'seats', 'Tom', 'sister', 'love', 'However', 'soon', 'Nola', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'who', 'eyes', 'soon', 'out', 'Nola', 'Tom', 'soon', 'be', 'wife', 'film', 'Chris', 'have', 'affair', 'Nola', 'up', 'Tom', 'continue', 'romance', 'knowledge', 'Tom', 'family', 'married', 'Tom', 'sister', 'are', 'now', 'expecting', 'child', 'father', 'in-law', 'dream', 'job', 'one', 'corporations', 'Yet', 'still', 'lure', 'temptress', 'Woddy', 'Allen', 'up', 'dilemma', 'main', 'character', 'question', 'love', 'lust', 'luck', 'fate', 'may', 'expect', 'film', 'be', 'lustful', 'drama', 'have', 'idea', 'where', 'Allen', 'next', 'brilliant', 'aspect', 'film', 'score', 'hate', 'films', 'score', 'think', 'music', '50', '%', 'film', 'emotional', 'effect', 'audience', 'where', 'original', 'score', 'opera', 'Allen', 'opera', 'structure', 'scenes', 'one', 'thing', 'Chris', 'family', 'opera', 'changes', 'tone', 'emotion', 'scene', 'perfection', 'film', 'interesting', 'may', 'find', 'debating', 'what', 'end', 'realize', 'ties', 'what', 'movie', 'about', 'film', 'plot', 'something', ""'d"", 'expect', 'Hitchcock', 'savory', 'one', 'movie', 'entertaining', 'thought', 'provoking', 'even', ""n't"", 'seem', 'plausible', 'times.ACTING', 'Jonathan', 'Rhys-Meyers', 'superb', 'job', 'even', 'think', 'dialogue', 'stilted', 'not', 'blame', 'fantatsic', 'job', 'what', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'temptress', 'even', 'somewhat', 'commercial', 'character', 'human', 'side', 'as', 'well', 'Great', 'acting', 'even', 'dialogue', 'stilted', 'times.BOTTOM', 'LINE', 'film', 'will', 'lead', 'one', 'way', 'only', 'make', 'sharp', 'left', 'take', 'where', 'would', ""n't"", 'expect', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'coming', 'dare', 'guess', 'ending', 'unfold', 'film', 'intelligent', 'interesting', 'watch', 'really', ""n't"", 'boast', 'technical', 'highlights', 'Cinematography', 'nothing', 'get', 'excited', 'one', 'doozy', 'screenplay']",Match Point

Corn ""reviewer""","[3, 6]","If I had to sum up the theme of this movie, I'd have to say it has to do with luck but the theme is far less important that its execution - and the result is a riveting movie, buoyed by the strong performances of every actor in this movie (Scarlett Johansson, Johnathan Rhys-Myers, Emily Mortimer,etc.Like so many Woody Allen movies, this one centers upon certain philosophical questions about life's meaning and the role that fate and destiny play. Is there an Ultimate Plan and how much comes down to luck and chance?The whole theme of luck is hinted at in the opening scenes of this film when a tennis ball is shown in flight, falling and then hitting the net, then frozen, neither falling on one side or the other, serving as a metaphor for luck. Which side will get the point and will that particular point determine the game?From that early scene, we are drawn into the life of Chris Wilton (Johnathan Rhys-Meyers), a former tennis pro who never made it to the very top and so is now working at a country club, teaching whoever comes his way. It is his good fortune to meet a young man who shares an interest in opera and who invites Chris to the opera.He doesn't know it but his life is already going down a certain path, one which will result in a web of intriguing complications. First he'll meet the young man's sister, Chloe, a woman who is smitten with him. THen he'll met the man's fiance, Nola, played quite well by Scarlett Johannsen, a woman who manages to be sexy, mysterious and flirtatious but also able to set limits as long as she is engaged.But when she is dumped by her fiance, Nola is open to having an affair with Chris. THe complication? He is by now married to Chloe and the marriage comes with an arranged job, a cushy new lifestyle and plenty of other quite appealing benefits, especially for a man without ""prospects"", someone used to working hard to get by. Suddenly everything has been handed to him.Nola is his Achilles heel, however, and she is also his passion. He lusts for her as he will never lust for his wife but Chris is not so smitten that he doesn't realize that Nola is a bit of a loose cannon. She is a  struggling actress who hasn't really gotten a major part, is impetuous and perhaps even emotionally unhinged. Perhaps that is even part of the attraction for Chris, a man who seems to manage to juggle both women, wife and mistress, quite adroitly...for a time.Then it all starts to unravel but not in the way you might expect. At this point, I think it is best to leave the rest up in the air because anything I add would be a MAJOR spoiler.I'll add just a couple of suggestions : no matter how caught up you get in the situation and what is happening in the movie, pay attention to the way luck and chance play out here. It is both amusing and horrifying and it makes for one very good film. It is the best Woody Allen film I've seen in years. Somehow it all comes together in this film and it all seems to work.I was riveted by watching the chemistry between Chris and Nola and I wondered how far he'd go for his passions and how much he'd risk for her. I was a bit surprised by the events that transpired in this movie, although I can't say I didn't see hints of what was to come. Still, it wasn't entirely predictable. There were moments of true surprise.I think some of the success of this film comes down to the fact that the characters (with the exception of Nola, who has fled her home state of Colorado) are British and their restraint, their controlled emotions, make every violent act just that much more shocking, the way darkness sets off the light - or vice versa.",5,"Ah....philosophy and romance in a spicy suspense film... and by, the way, how lucky do YOU feel?",1146787200,"05 5, 2006",2006,3627,"['had', 'sum', 'up', 'theme', 'movie', ""'d"", 'have', 'say', 'do', 'luck', 'theme', 'far', 'less', 'important', 'execution', 'result', 'riveting', 'movie', 'buoyed', 'strong', 'performances', 'actor', 'movie', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'Johnathan', 'Rhys-Myers', 'Emily', 'Mortimer', 'etc.Like', 'so', 'many', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'movies', 'one', 'centers', 'certain', 'philosophical', 'questions', 'life', 'meaning', 'role', 'fate', 'destiny', 'play', 'Ultimate', 'Plan', 'how', 'much', 'down', 'luck', 'chance', 'whole', 'theme', 'luck', 'hinted', 'opening', 'scenes', 'film', 'when', 'tennis', 'ball', 'shown', 'flight', 'falling', 'then', 'hitting', 'net', 'then', 'frozen', 'falling', 'one', 'side', 'other', 'serving', 'metaphor', 'luck', 'Which', 'side', 'will', 'get', 'point', 'will', 'particular', 'point', 'determine', 'game', 'early', 'scene', 'are', 'drawn', 'life', 'Chris', 'Wilton', 'Johnathan', 'Rhys-Meyers', 'former', 'tennis', 'pro', 'who', 'never', 'made', 'very', 'top', 'so', 'now', 'working', 'country', 'club', 'teaching', 'whoever', 'way', 'good', 'fortune', 'meet', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'shares', 'interest', 'opera', 'who', 'Chris', 'opera.He', ""n't"", 'know', 'life', 'already', 'going', 'down', 'certain', 'path', 'one', 'will', 'result', 'web', 'intriguing', 'complications', 'First', ""'ll"", 'meet', 'young', 'man', 'sister', 'Chloe', 'woman', 'who', 'smitten', ""'ll"", 'met', 'man', 'fiance', 'Nola', 'played', 'quite', 'well', 'Scarlett', 'Johannsen', 'woman', 'who', 'be', 'sexy', 'mysterious', 'flirtatious', 'also', 'able', 'set', 'limits', 'as', 'long', 'engaged.But', 'when', 'dumped', 'fiance', 'Nola', 'open', 'having', 'affair', 'Chris', 'THe', 'complication', 'now', 'married', 'Chloe', 'marriage', 'arranged', 'job', 'cushy', 'new', 'lifestyle', 'plenty', 'other', 'quite', 'appealing', 'benefits', 'especially', 'man', 'prospects', 'someone', 'used', 'working', 'hard', 'get', 'Suddenly', 'everything', 'been', 'handed', 'him.Nola', 'Achilles', 'heel', 'however', 'also', 'passion', 'will', 'never', 'lust', 'wife', 'Chris', 'not', 'so', 'smitten', ""n't"", 'realize', 'Nola', 'bit', 'loose', 'cannon', 'struggling', 'actress', 'who', ""n't"", 'really', 'gotten', 'major', 'part', 'impetuous', 'perhaps', 'even', 'emotionally', 'unhinged', 'Perhaps', 'even', 'part', 'attraction', 'Chris', 'man', 'who', 'manage', 'juggle', 'women', 'wife', 'mistress', 'quite', 'adroitly', 'time.Then', 'unravel', 'not', 'way', 'might', 'expect', 'point', 'think', 'best', 'leave', 'rest', 'up', 'air', 'anything', 'add', 'would', 'be', 'MAJOR', 'spoiler.I', ""'ll"", 'add', 'just', 'couple', 'suggestions', 'matter', 'how', 'caught', 'up', 'get', 'situation', 'what', 'happening', 'movie', 'pay', 'attention', 'way', 'luck', 'chance', 'play', 'here', 'amusing', 'horrifying', 'one', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'best', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'film', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'years', 'Somehow', 'together', 'film', 'work.I', 'was', 'riveted', 'watching', 'chemistry', 'Chris', 'Nola', 'wondered', 'how', 'far', ""'d"", 'go', 'passions', 'how', 'much', ""'d"", 'risk', 'was', 'bit', 'surprised', 'events', 'transpired', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'hints', 'what', 'was', 'come', 'Still', 'was', ""n't"", 'entirely', 'predictable', 'were', 'moments', 'true', 'surprise.I', 'think', 'success', 'film', 'down', 'fact', 'characters', 'exception', 'Nola', 'who', 'fled', 'home', 'state', 'Colorado', 'are', 'British', 'restraint', 'controlled', 'emotions', 'make', 'violent', 'act', 'just', 'that', 'much', 'more', 'shocking', 'way', 'darkness', 'sets', 'light', 'vice', 'versa']",Match Point

I'm Kind Of A ...","[3, 3]","I can't lie; I had already judged Match Point to be a boring girl movie that I was sure I didn't want to see before I even saw the previews. It could have something to do with the fact that every girl I know wanted to see it. The cast is pretty good but something about it just spoke to me and it said I really don't want to even attempt to watch this movie. Anyway I had no choice but to watch it when I was cornered and forced to watch it on movie night and I have to admit that it was pretty good. Though the movie is full of lust, love, the fear of not getting to live a lavish lifestyle because your cheating on your wife, oh and the woman you cheated with is also your brother-in-law's girlfriend.See what makes Match Point so mysterious and vile is that I could tell most of the film and the viewer still wouldn't be prepared for the huge plot twist. I have seen some crazy twist in a movie but the one in this film was badly needed. You start to get lost somewhere around the middle when the director works that movie magic that makes time go faster.

977647,A6ADO7B6FUVN,B000EQHXNW,"Kim Anehall ""www.cinematica.org""","[6, 7]","After several decades of shooting intriguing comedies, dramas, and mutations of the two, Woody Allen has eventually reached the point where he again reinvents himself.  His newest film, Match Point, might be one of his very best, as it definitely is his best within the last decade.  Despite its similar application of interpersonal tension as his Interiors (1978) and September (1987), the film provides a distinctly different atmosphere compared to his other films.  Allen allows the audience to venture into the psyche of Chris Wilton (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers) in a beguiling cerebral drama that dissects the philosophical importance of mere luck.By appearance, it is rather obvious that Woody Allen never had a chance to reach stardom in athletics with the exception of being a jockey.  Nonetheless, he has repeatedly displayed his intellect in regards to athletics and sports in a thoughtfully intelligent manner.  Sure, on occasion, he has even made fun of the sports, but it has never been tactless.  In Annie Hall (1977), his character Alvy Singer told Annie (Diane Keaton) in the theater line that those who cannot become teachers with the exception of physical education teachers.  Almost two decades later Allen returns to point out the importance of athletics in the Western society, as the former tennis pro Wilton attempts to seek his fortune among the London aristocrats by using his skills in tennis and quaint discourse.Match Point begins by planting a seed in the audience's mind by letting a tennis ball strike the top of the net and then freeze in mid air while Rhys-Meyers' voice points out the importance of luck needed for a ball to continue over the net.  It is an intriguing notion that luck often has decisive power of a situation such as it can determine the outcome of a tennis game.  However, Allen takes the notion even a step further by applying it to the path of people's lives.  The existential determination based on luck is rather obvious in the beginning of the film when Wilton finds employment, as a tennis coach in an extraordinarily exclusive tennis club.  Wilton, once born into Irish poverty, has now been fortunate to make ends meet through tennis while many of the people in his working environment have the privilege to enjoy the birthright of wealth and social status.The initial illustration of luck determined through birth eventually diffuses, as Wilton's actions bring him in a desired direction.  He befriends the rich Tom Hewett (Matthew Goode) by becoming his coaching tennis partner, and eventually Wilton finds himself invited to an opera.  Wilton nurtures the friendship by never taking advantage of the situation, or his new friend by insisting on paying for himself despite his meager salary.  Through Wilton's new friendship, he also encounters Tom's sister Chloe (Emily Mortimer) who he begins to court, after she shows interest in him.  Even the parents of Hewett family performed by Brian Cox and Penelope Wilton take liking to him.  It is evident that luck alone does not make things happen, however, luck still is the decisive factor of new encounters.As the film unfolds, Allen also allows luck to collide from two different directions - wealth and love.  It all begins when Wilton meets Nola (Scarlett Johansson) who is Tom's fianc&eacute;.  Nola is much like Wilton, who is raised in poverty who tries to find her way out of her misfortunate situation, and Tom has fortunately crossed her path like a knight in shining armor with his deep bank account.  Through Wilton, the audience realizes that he cannot acquire both, as he either must remain true to Chloe to secure his future, or pursue Nola for love.  It leaves him with a deep personal predicament, as he must confront his own greed and lust, which he begins to rationalize in his own favor.It is in the conflict between love and wealth that the story's treasure rests, as Allen rises several existential questions such as is it wrong to wish oneself riches and can love provide everything necessary in life?  To increase the complexity within the story Allen pushes boundaries beyond what he has ever done previously in a ghastly manner.  The film also has a slight tone of Robert Bresson with its unique minimalist approach, which augments the minute actions and incidents within the story.  Allen never says what is right or wrong through the film, he simply lets the camera capture the truth.  It is both refreshing and horrid, as the minimalism enhances the offensive nature of the story and compels the audience to ponder the morality of Wilton's situation.The convergence between the notions of fortunate happenstance and morality ushers the audience into a thoughtful mode while following the intriguing rationalization of Wilton and his actions.  The film also provides an interesting perspective of how luck ambiguously affects people's lives, as Allen exhaustively presents an emotional drama that intentionally keeps its distance to the audience in order for the viewer to dwell on the concepts presented.  However, it leaves the audience disturbed on a very intellectual level, as it purposely stirs the very foundation of moral development.  The film does not allow the audience to feel neutral to the topic, as it presents a very dark tale, which can be summed up by Wilton's statement, ""I'd rather be lucky than good.""",5,"""I'd rather be

Jonathan Rhys Meyers plays Chris, a retired British tennis pro, and the lovely and dynamic Scarlett Johanssen plays Nola, his American mistress in London.Although the three-and-a-half star MATCH POINT is deplorably overlong, Allen handles the story well: Chris is married into the very wealthy, respectable, and reasonably normal oh-so-English Hewitt family. He and his wife Chloe are trying to have a baby, Chloe desperately so.While Chris spends his days working for Chloe's father he falls passionately in love with Nola, a struggling actress who is everything his pleasant but conventional wife is not. Johanssen is the Golden Woman, a tempestuous, beautiful dream. Ultimately, of course, she wants exactly what Chloe has.The rather lighthearted story begins to take on darker and darker hues as the tale unfolds. It is important to note that MATCH POINT never becomes INTERIORS.Chris finds himself juggling two lives and is unable to commit fully to either one. His final choice is explosive and shocking, and leaves everyone's life ineradicably altered.Johanssen is not just a pretty face. The twenty-one year old actress carries this demanding and mature role very well. While Allen spends most of his time on character development and, of course motivation, the rest of the characters are just backdrop.

977656,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000EQHXNW,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[2, 6]","Chris Wilton (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) once played on the professional men's tour and is now taking gainful employment as a tennis pro.  He illustrates the importance of luck by showing a tennis ball striking the tape at the top of the net.  The shot is played out in slow motion so we can see the point at which the ball is either going to sustain its spin and make it over the net to drop on the other side for a winning point, or it is going to drop down on the same side and cost who hit it a point (then again, it could be a serve and therefore either a bad first serve or a double fault if it is a second; but the assumption is that it is a regular shot and not a serve, so we will proceed on that basis).  We are given to believe that Chris' life is heading for such a moment, although we expect it to be rendered metaphorically and not quite so literally.At the tennis club Chris works with Tom Hewett (Matthew Goode), who is impressed enough by the former pro to invite him to the opera when he discovers it is something Chris enjoys.  The Hewett family has box seats, which seems a bit ostentatious for a place where ""La Traviata"" is being performed with only a piano accompaniment, but clearly the Hewetts have money.  When Tom's sister, Chloe (Emily Mortimer), discovers she likes Chris he is invited to the family home.  Her parents, Alec (Brian Cox) and Eleanor (Penelope Wilton), welcome him and since his daughter clearly wants Chris, Alec offers him a job in one of his companies.  After all, you have to be more than a tennis pro to live in this world.Tom is dating Nola Rice (Scarlett Johansson), an American who has aspirations of being an actress but even less drive than Chris to attain such a professional goal.  There are sparks between Nola and Chris, but she is not going to marry a tennis pro and he makes the prudent choice to marry Chloe.  But after Chris marries, Tom breaks up with Nola, making her available.  More importantly, she is more interested this time around.  So while Chris is trying unsuccessfully to get Chloe pregnant, he has an affair with Nola and the irony continues as she is the one who becomes pregnant.  What does Tom do now?Answering that question would give away the fun.  ""Match Point"" is one of those movies where it takes a while for you to discover what it is about, even with the help given by the opening shot and narration.  Suffice it to say that when you come up with the name of the director whose ballpark Allen is playing in this time around it is not going to be Ingmar Bergman who comes to mind.  In fact, if you skipped the opening credits of this film you would be hard pressed to ever think of Allen as being involved creatively.  The storyline is not familiar territory, his stock characters are not on display, and there is virtually nothing in the way of humor.  Only if you know it is Allen do you notice the improvisational dialogue and the tendency to position the camera and let things happen in front of it instead of panning or zooming.Even if this is a Woody Allen film unlike previous Woody Allen films, it appears to be required to put ""Match Point"" in a frame of reference to those previous movies.  I would have to point to ""Crimes and Misdemeanors"" for its fatalism, ""Hannah and Her Sisters"" because it turns out that what it is about is exactly what it tells us up front it is about, and ""Interiors"" since Allen neither appears as an actor in his film nor foists another in the Woody Allen role on us.  ""Stardust Memories"" also springs to mind because I end up thinking that it has been a long time since people from a planet, whether this one or some other, complained that they liked his earlier, funnier films.  ""Match Point"" certainly leaves things wide open as to what he will do next, especially now that he has once again caught our attention.",5,"The man who said ""I'd rather be lucky than good"" saw deeply into life",1146268800,"04 29, 2006",2006,3835,"['Chris', 'Wilton', 'Jonathan', 'Rhys', 'Meyers', 'once', 'played', 'professional', 'men', 'tour', 'now', 'taking', 'gainful', 'employment', 'tennis', 'pro', 'importance', 'luck', 'showing', 'tennis', 'ball', 'striking', 'tape', 'top', 'net', 'shot', 'played', 'out', 'slow', 'motion', 'can', 'see', 'point', 'ball', 'either', 'going', 'sustain', 'spin', 'make', 'net', 'drop', 'other', 'side', 'winning', 'point', 'going', 'drop', 'down', 'same', 'side', 'cost', 'who', 'hit', 'point', 'then', 'again', 'could', 'be', 'serve', 'therefore', 'bad', 'first', 'serve', 'double', 'fault', 'second', 'assumption', 'regular', 'shot', 'not', 'serve', 'will', 'proceed', 'basis', 'are', 'given', 'believe', 'Chris', 'life', 'heading', 'moment', 'expect', 'be', 'rendered', 'metaphorically', 'not', 'quite', 'so', 'literally.At', 'tennis', 'club', 'Chris', 'Tom', 'Hewett', 'Matthew', 'Goode', 'who', 'impressed', 'enough', 'former', 'pro', 'invite', 'opera', 'when', 'something', 'Chris', 'Hewett', 'family', 'box', 'seats', 'bit', 'ostentatious', 'place', 'where', 'La', 'Traviata', 'being', 'performed', 'only', 'piano', 'accompaniment', 'clearly', 'Hewetts', 'have', 'money', 'When', 'Tom', 'sister', 'Chloe', 'Emily', 'Mortimer', 'Chris', 'invited', 'family', 'home', 'parents', 'Alec', 'Brian', 'Cox', 'Eleanor', 'Penelope', 'Wilton', 'welcome', 'daughter', 'clearly', 'Chris', 'Alec', 'job', 'one', 'companies', 'have', 'be', 'more', 'tennis', 'pro', 'live', 'world.Tom', 'dating', 'Nola', 'Rice', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'American', 'who', 'aspirations', 'being', 'actress', 'even', 'less', 'drive', 'Chris', 'attain', 'such', 'professional', 'goal', 'are', 'sparks', 'Nola', 'Chris', 'not', 'going', 'marry', 'tennis', 'pro', 'prudent', 'choice', 'marry', 'Chloe', 'Chris', 'marries', 'Tom', 'up', 'Nola', 'making', 'available', 'More', 'importantly', 'more', 'interested', 'time', 'around', 'So', 'Chris', 'trying', 'unsuccessfully', 'get', 'Chloe', 'pregnant', 'affair', 'Nola', 'irony', 'one', 'who', 'pregnant', 'What', 'Tom', 'do', 'now', 'Answering', 'question', 'would', 'give', 'away', 'fun', 'Match', 'Point', 'one', 'movies', 'where', 'while', 'discover', 'what', 'even', 'help', 'given', 'opening', 'shot', 'narration', 'Suffice', 'say', 'when', 'come', 'up', 'name', 'director', 'ballpark', 'Allen', 'playing', 'time', 'not', 'going', 'be', 'Ingmar', 'Bergman', 'who', 'mind', 'fact', 'skipped', 'opening', 'credits', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'hard', 'pressed', 'ever', 'think', 'Allen', 'being', 'involved', 'creatively', 'storyline', 'not', 'familiar', 'territory', 'stock', 'characters', 'are', 'not', 'display', 'virtually', 'nothing', 'way', 'humor', 'Only', 'know', 'Allen', 'do', 'notice', 'improvisational', 'dialogue', 'tendency', 'position', 'camera', 'let', 'things', 'happen', 'front', 'instead', 'panning', 'zooming.Even', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'film', 'previous', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'films', 'be', 'required', 'put', 'Match', 'Point', 'frame', 'reference', 'previous', 'movies', 'would', 'have', 'point', 'Crimes', 'Misdemeanors', 'fatalism', 'Hannah', 'Sisters', 'out', 'what', 'about', 'exactly', 'what', 'up', 'front', 'Interiors', 'Allen', 'actor', 'film', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'role', 'Stardust', 'Memories', 'also', 'mind', 'end', 'up', 'thinking', 'been', 'long', 'time', 'people', 'planet', 'one', 'other', 'complained', 'liked', 'earlier', 'funnier', 'films', 'Match', 'Point', 'certainly', 'things', 'wide', 'open', 'what', 'will', 'do', 'next', 'especially', 'now', 'once', 'again', 'caught', 'attention']",Match Point

Jonathan Rhys Meyers is her match as the amoral, social-climbing former tennis touring pro (a salute to ""Strangers on a Train""?), who reads but maybe doesn't quite get the point of Dostoyevsky (clue alert!), and Emily Mortimer takes the role Allen would once have given to Diane Keaton, as Chris's naive wife, Chloe. They inject passion into what are, essentially, cardboard characters (as with Hitchcock, don't waste time supposing that these people are in any sense real).The last half hour or so, when the plot unfolds with this annoying opera aria on the sound track (it adds to the agita, but you may want to reach for your mute button and turn on the English subtitles), ranks with the best stuff Allen's ever done (and we haven't seen much of his best lately), and he even tacks on one of those tongue-in-cheek ""feel good"" endings Hitchcock opted for (""Vertigo,"" ""Psycho,"" and those monologues at the end of his tv shows).Good job.",4,The 40th Step,1154822400,"08 6, 2006",2006,1665,"[""'ve"", 'always', 'hoped', 'day', 'director', 'would', 'get', 'homage', 'Hitchcock', 'reasonably', 'right', 'Here', 'one', 'form', 'almost', 'too', 'clever', 'Match', 'Point', 'directed', 'people', 'Woody', 'Allen.Allen', 'principle', 'way', 'create', 'most', 'suspense', 'let', 'audience', 'secret', 'Doris', 'Day', 'waiting', 'cymbal', 'player', 'Man', 'Who', 'Knew', 'Too', 'Much', 'fun', 'waiting', 'see', 'how', 'things', 'play', 'out.Scarlett', 'Johannson', 'era', 'uber-femme', 'role', 'Hitchcock', 'Blonde', 'wonderfully', 'pheromonal', 'Nola', 'aggressive', 'brassy-voiced', 'American', 'wannabee', 'actress', 'living', 'London', '180', 'degrees', 'so', 'far', 'signature', 'role', 'Lost', 'Translation', 'Jonathan', 'Rhys', 'Meyers', 'match', 'amoral', 'social-climbing', 'former', 'tennis', 'touring', 'pro', 'salute', 'Strangers', 'Train', 'who', 'maybe', ""n't"", 'quite', 'get', 'point', 'Dostoyevsky', 'clue', 'alert', 'Emily', 'Mortimer', 'role', 'Allen', 'would', 'once', 'have', 'given', 'Diane', 'Keaton', 'Chris', 'naive', 'wife', 'Chloe', 'inject', 'passion', 'what', 'are', 'essentially', 'cardboard', 'characters', 'Hitchcock', 'do', ""n't"", 'waste', 'time', 'supposing', 'people', 'are', 'sense', 'real', '.The', 'last', 'half', 'hour', 'so', 'when', 'plot', 'annoying', 'opera', 'aria', 'sound', 'track', 'agita', 'may', 'want', 'reach', 'mute', 'button', 'turn', 'English', 'subtitles', 'best', 'stuff', 'Allen', 'ever', 'done', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'much', 'best', 'lately', 'even', 'one', 'tongue-in-cheek', 'feel', 'good', 'endings', 'Hitchcock', 'opted', 'Vertigo', 'Psycho', 'monologues', 'end', 'tv', 'shows', '.Good', 'job']",Match Point

977662,A7NRL3R5C0AL4,B000EQHXNW,"Maeri ""Marysz""","[3, 5]","This is a remake of Allen's earlier film ""Crimes and Misdemeanors""--only this time it takes place in London. Chris Wilton is an upwardly striving ex-tennis pro who, by a stoke of luck, marries into an enormously wealthy, upper-class family. The family talks in the same stilted way that the rich, WASP family in Allen's film ""Interiors"" did--Allen's writing about a world where he's an outsider and it shows. But Wilcox is an outsider too, and is undone by his affair with his brother-in-law's ex-fiancee, a failed American actress named Nola Rice, who's an emotional mess and trouble with a capitol T. She threatens to go to his wife and like Judah Rosenthal in ""Crimes and Misdemeanors,"" Wilton plots her murder. Johnathan Rhys Meyers simply doesn't yet have the depth as an actor that the middle-aged Martin Landau did in C&M;, so the emotional impact of the film ends up feeling muted. Also, in C&M;, Allen's characters were in a New York milieu that Allen knew inside and out, and it gave the film (and Landau's character) a fluency and emotional depth that's missing here. The only authentic characterization in the film is Scarlett Johansson's as the neurotic Nola Rice. She's terrific and the film feels stiff and lifeless when she's not on the screen (maybe that's why Allen has to bring her back as a ghost). Rice is a female character-type Allen loves and knows all too well, and she brings out the best in him as a writer and director.Allen sanitizes London in this film the same way he sanitizes New York. Woody Allen's cities are aesthetically and culturally beautiful environments for the rich. There's no place for the poor (or even the middle-class) except in their roles as maids, secretaries, nannies and chauffers for their wealthy employers. Or, like Nola Rice,  they can be illicit lovers and get in the way. Why is Allen so enthralled with wealth? Maybe he feels (or knows from experience) that poverty carries no intrinsic virtue.

977665,A2ULSA0IRUE09E,B000EQHXNW,Marc Cabir Davis,"[1, 3]","I think the main problem with this movie is that they tried to give it such a stiff, British air, but the entire thing came across as being very staged and wooden. Prime offender is the lead actor Jonathan Rhys Meyers, who is a very pleasing-looking young man, but certainly not the kind of person who can shoulder the weight of one entire film (I recently watched him in the miniseries ""Gormenghast"" where he was the lead and he suffered similar problems there too).Scarlett Johansson, who is now officially the muse of Allen, turns up every now and then looking all Scarletty, pout and all. Let me say this - the role is NOT a stretch for the actress as I suspect this is how she is in real life too. Also, I especially had a problem with the supposed sex scenes between Meyers and Johansson - they were lifeless, passionless and it looked like both the actors were really trying to get into one another without much success (it actually looked like a gay man and a lesbian woman trying to hit it off - you can imagine THAT!).The secondary characters play their parts a whole lot better. But thats a pity because most of the screen time is wasted on the leads. What IS good about this, is that the dialogue is impeccable. Not groundbreaking, mind you, but certainly a cut above the rest, to be sure. Allen is great at this sort of thing, I only wish he would get over his obsession with Scarlett and give parts to other, more deserving actresses. All she has is amazing beauty, but I hardly think shes a talented actress (unless biting your lips and giving men come-hither looks is your definition of acting).The tennis allegories and innuendoes also tend to wear thin after a point, and the 'chilling ending' was pretty much an afterthought (the lead actor kills his pregnant girlfriend and escapes unscathed). I also didn't quite understand the 'passionate relationship' between him and his girlfriend played by Scarlett, as they seemed very 'not into each other'. A severe problem of bad casting one might say.In a film where the leads are supposed to carry the movie forward, this was an exercise in futility, as neither was there much to write home about, nor is Jonathan Rhys Meyers capable of handling such a demanding role with the precision it deserves (notice the scenes where he needs to look smouldering and brazen - he only looks girlish and confused, not to mention coy and retiring). His great beauty apart, this was a hollow performance.Woody Allen is a great writer and film-maker, but I think that 'Scoop' that came after this was definitely a far superior film.

977666,A3R4ZEDVRUWJNO,B000EQHXNW,Mark,"[4, 6]","Just when you think you have pegged Woody Allen to a certain type of film, he surprises everyone with a film like this.  Working at a video story, I found some of the conversations that I heard right around Match Point's theatrical release interesting.  They would go something like: ""Oh, I really want to see the new Woody Allen movie, Match Point.""  ""Oh really, what's it about?""  ""Tennis, or something.""  I don't think anything could have prepared these people for the show they were about to get.  The beginning of the film finds Chris Wilton (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) taking up a job teaching tennis (this is really the only tennis in the film).  Chris is ambitious, greatly wanting to ""make something"" of his life, as he puts it.  Before long, he meets Tom Hewett (Matthew Goode), his sister Chloe (Emily Mortimer), and Tom's sexy fiance Nola Rice (played wonderfully by Scarlett Johansson).  Immediately, Chris is extremely attracted to Nola, and their tension is immediately felt.  The disappointing part about this is that we are thrown into a sense of passion, only to be left hanging when Chris and Nola's relationship takes a dive down to a more basic level.  In their first encounter, they are flirting like mad, with sexual inuendo's flying every which way, and the viewer is intrigued.  But in their next encounters, their relationship is reduced to ""Hey, how are you? Care for a drink?"" and in which we find out everything there is to know about Nola and her past.  This is the only problem with the film.  Couldn't we leave Nola as a mystery, like Glenn Close's character in Fatal Attraction?  Now, Johansson's character isn't nearly as bad as Alex, but more on this later.  Chris and Nola have a heated encounter later, but nothing becomes of it.  Nola and Tom break up, and Nola vanishes from our lives, during which Chris marries Chloe.  Almost immediately, we see a change in Chris.  He quits his job to work for Chloe's father Alec (Brian Cox) at a big mega-corporation.  Immediately, Chris' character begins to change, and we can see he is bored; bored with Chloe and her desperation to become pregnant, bored with the nine to five office job, and bored with the stuff he didn't want.  Then, Nola reenters the picture, and her flame with Chris ignites again.  She becomes a bit obsessive, begging Chris to leave Chloe, and calling him at all hours of the day.  This is the part where Allen starts toying with us.  Do we side with Chris?  He's obviously doing Chloe wrong.  Or do we side with Nola?  Yes, she's a bit obsessive, but can we blame her?  Chris feeds her with empty promise after empty promise, with absolutely no outcome.  When Nola becomes pregnant, the real suspense begins.  What is Chris to do?Woody Allen crafts an ending that is the perfect example of how to use a ""twist ending"" that is so often misused by filmmakers and writers.  The film is so well written, so well put together, and so well acted.  Meyers is the perfect person for this role, and he almost reminds me of a cleaner, well-dressed, Irish Joaquin Phoenix.  Allen's writing has been a little off lately, but Match Point puts him back on track.  Hopefully he can follow this one up with something equally as good, if not better.  Match Point is emotionally, physically, and psychologically tense from beginning to end, always one step ahead of the viewer.  Match Point is one of 2005's best films, and a triumph for Woody Allen.",5,One of the years most well-crafted films,1145664000,"04 22, 2006",2006,3432,"['Just', 'when', 'think', 'have', 'pegged', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'certain', 'type', 'film', 'everyone', 'film', 'Working', 'video', 'story', 'found', 'conversations', 'heard', 'right', 'Match', 'Point', 'theatrical', 'release', 'interesting', 'would', 'go', 'something', 'Oh', 'really', 'want', 'see', 'new', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'movie', 'Match', 'Point', 'Oh', 'really', 'what', 'Tennis', 'something', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'anything', 'could', 'have', 'prepared', 'people', 'show', 'were', 'about', 'get', 'beginning', 'film', 'Chris', 'Wilton', 'Jonathan', 'Rhys', 'Meyers', 'taking', 'up', 'job', 'teaching', 'tennis', 'really', 'only', 'tennis', 'film', 'Chris', 'ambitious', 'greatly', 'wanting', 'make', 'something', 'life', 'long', 'Tom', 'Hewett', 'Matthew', 'Goode', 'sister', 'Chloe', 'Emily', 'Mortimer', 'Tom', 'sexy', 'fiance', 'Nola', 'Rice', 'played', 'wonderfully', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'Immediately', 'Chris', 'extremely', 'attracted', 'Nola', 'tension', 'immediately', 'felt', 'disappointing', 'part', 'are', 'thrown', 'sense', 'passion', 'only', 'be', 'left', 'hanging', 'when', 'Chris', 'Nola', 'relationship', 'dive', 'down', 'more', 'basic', 'level', 'first', 'encounter', 'are', 'flirting', 'mad', 'sexual', 'inuendo', 'flying', 'way', 'viewer', 'intrigued', 'next', 'encounters', 'relationship', 'reduced', 'Hey', 'how', 'are', 'Care', 'drink', 'find', 'out', 'everything', 'there', 'know', 'Nola', 'past', 'only', 'problem', 'film', 'Could', ""n't"", 'leave', 'Nola', 'mystery', 'Glenn', 'Close', 'character', 'Fatal', 'Attraction', 'Now', 'Johansson', 'character', ""n't"", 'nearly', 'as', 'bad', 'Alex', 'more', 'later', 'Chris', 'Nola', 'have', 'heated', 'encounter', 'later', 'nothing', 'becomes', 'Nola', 'Tom', 'break', 'up', 'Nola', 'vanishes', 'lives', 'Chris', 'marries', 'Chloe', 'Almost', 'immediately', 'see', 'change', 'Chris', 'job', 'work', 'Chloe', 'father', 'Alec', 'Brian', 'Cox', 'big', 'mega-corporation', 'Immediately', 'Chris', 'character', 'change', 'can', 'see', 'bored', 'bored', 'Chloe', 'desperation', 'become', 'pregnant', 'bored', 'nine', 'five', 'office', 'job', 'bored', 'stuff', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'Then', 'Nola', 'picture', 'flame', 'Chris', 'ignites', 'again', 'bit', 'obsessive', 'begging', 'Chris', 'leave', 'Chloe', 'calling', 'hours', 'day', 'part', 'where', 'Allen', 'toying', 'Do', 'side', 'Chris', 'obviously', 'doing', 'Chloe', 'wrong', 'do', 'side', 'Nola', 'Yes', 'bit', 'obsessive', 'can', 'blame', 'Chris', 'empty', 'promise', 'empty', 'promise', 'absolutely', 'outcome', 'When', 'Nola', 'pregnant', 'real', 'suspense', 'What', 'Chris', 'do', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'crafts', 'ending', 'perfect', 'example', 'how', 'use', 'twist', 'ending', 'so', 'often', 'misused', 'filmmakers', 'writers', 'film', 'so', 'well', 'written', 'so', 'well', 'put', 'together', 'so', 'well', 'acted', 'Meyers', 'perfect', 'person', 'role', 'almost', 'cleaner', 'well-dressed', 'Irish', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'Allen', 'writing', 'been', 'little', 'off', 'lately', 'Match', 'Point', 'back', 'track', 'Hopefully', 'can', 'follow', 'one', 'up', 'something', 'equally', 'as', 'good', 'not', 'better', 'Match', 'Point', 'emotionally', 'physically', 'psychologically', 'tense', 'beginning', 'end', 'always', 'one', 'step', 'ahead', 'viewer', 'Match', 'Point', 'one', '2005', 'best', 'films', 'triumph', 'Woody', 'Allen']",Match Point

977668,A3ONTLXQ85EE4G,B000EQHXNW,Marshall Lord,"[5, 7]","Woody Allen's first film shot in London is very different from most of his previous work. The acting is uniformly excellent, the sets and panoramic views are magnificent and really show off the best of modern London, the pace works well, and the drama gradually sucks you in. The story is fairly serious, there is little humour (zany or otherwise).Some people will really like this, others will find it hard work or depressing. About three quarters of the way through there is a shock twist, the story changes from drama to thriller and doesn't end the way most people will have anticipated. The good aspect of this is that the film isn't boringly predictable, the problem is that some viewers will have great difficulty in suspending disbelief that the final outcome could possibly happen.The central character, Chris Wilton (played by Jonathan Rhys Meyers) is a former tennis professional from a poor Irish background. The film starts with him doing a voice-over about the fact that in tennis sometimes the ball catches in the top of the net. If it tips over, ""you win,"" if the ball falls back to your side, ""you lose."" Much later in the film, you see a round object hit the top of a barrier as it falls, and the camera zooms in in exactly the same way - it is clear that which side of the barrier the object falls will have life transforming consequences for the central character. And it does - but not in the way you expect.Jonathan Rhys Meyers delivers an excellent performance as Chris Wilton, flawless except perhaps that he seems to have too perfectly removed the least sign in his looks, accent, mannerisms or dress that he supposedly comes from a poor Irish background. Arriving in London, he gets a job as a tennis coach, and one of his clients, Tom Hewett (Matthew Goode) introduces Chris to his super-wealthy family. Tom's sister Chloe (Emily Mortimer) falls very deeply in love with Chris: her father Alec (Brian Cox) is also impressed by him, and before he knows it Chris is being groomed both as Chloe's future husband and for a glittering business career in one of Alec's companies.Chris is quickly seduced both by Chloe and by the life of wealth and comfort which her family offers. The one barrier on his path to a life of success and affluence is that he is badly smitten by Tom's fiancee Nola, played by Scarlett Johanssen. Perhaps the most implausible of the many unlikely elements of the film is that Scarlett Johanssen's character is a failing actress - for all the suggestion that she loses her confidence at interviews it is hard to credit that the smouldering femme fatale she plays throughout the film would be unable to land any acting roles.The love triangle between Chris, Nola, and Chloe leads steadily and inexorably to disaster, but not the disaster which the viewer thinks you can see coming. At first Chris seems to be faced with a choice -  on one side his wealthy and comfortable life with a woman who loves him, on the other, poverty and the woman who he really lusts after. You are never quite sure which of them - if either - he truly loves. But the choice he actually makes is much darker.Emily Mortimer is in great danger of getting typecast as the nice girl who falls badly for a man who lets her down, but perhaps this is because, as in ""Sleeping Dictionary"" and ""Young Adam,"" she plays this roles very well.Besides Rhys Meyers, Johanssen, and Mortimer, the rest of the cast are excellent, including James Nesbitt as a police detective.The shared taste which gets Chris his initial introduction to Tom's family is a love of Opera, and the soundtrack features many opera greats including arias from La Traviata, Rigoletto and Macbeth, both recent performances and old recordings by Caruso and others.The biggest issue which many people, especially those who know London well, will have with the film is the credibility of the conclusion. I don't think anyone can have told Woody Allen that Britain has a fifth of the world's CCTV cameras and London has more of them than any other city on earth - to say more than that would give away the ending.Overall this was a clever and stylish film. I'm glad I watched it, but would put this down as one to rent rather than buy.",4,"Sophisticated, well acted thriller, but a bit implausible.,",1169337600,"01 21, 2007",2007,4213,"['Woody', 'Allen', 'first', 'film', 'shot', 'London', 'very', 'different', 'most', 'previous', 'work', 'acting', 'uniformly', 'excellent', 'sets', 'panoramic', 'views', 'are', 'magnificent', 'really', 'show', 'off', 'best', 'modern', 'London', 'pace', 'well', 'drama', 'gradually', 'story', 'fairly', 'serious', 'little', 'humour', 'zany', 'otherwise', '.Some', 'people', 'will', 'really', 'like', 'others', 'will', 'find', 'hard', 'work', 'depressing', 'three', 'quarters', 'way', 'shock', 'twist', 'story', 'changes', 'drama', 'thriller', ""n't"", 'end', 'way', 'most', 'people', 'will', 'have', 'anticipated', 'good', 'aspect', 'film', ""n't"", 'boringly', 'predictable', 'problem', 'viewers', 'will', 'have', 'great', 'difficulty', 'suspending', 'disbelief', 'final', 'outcome', 'could', 'possibly', 'happen.The', 'central', 'character', 'Chris', 'Wilton', 'played', 'Jonathan', 'Rhys', 'Meyers', 'former', 'tennis', 'professional', 'poor', 'Irish', 'background', 'film', 'doing', 'voice-over', 'fact', 'tennis', 'sometimes', 'ball', 'catches', 'top', 'net', 'win', 'ball', 'back', 'side', 'lose', 'Much', 'later', 'film', 'see', 'round', 'object', 'hit', 'top', 'barrier', 'camera', 'zooms', 'exactly', 'same', 'way', 'clear', 'side', 'barrier', 'object', 'will', 'have', 'life', 'transforming', 'consequences', 'central', 'character', 'not', 'way', 'expect.Jonathan', 'Rhys', 'Meyers', 'delivers', 'excellent', 'performance', 'Chris', 'Wilton', 'flawless', 'perhaps', 'have', 'too', 'perfectly', 'removed', 'least', 'sign', 'looks', 'accent', 'dress', 'supposedly', 'poor', 'Irish', 'background', 'Arriving', 'London', 'job', 'tennis', 'coach', 'one', 'clients', 'Tom', 'Hewett', 'Matthew', 'Goode', 'Chris', 'super-wealthy', 'family', 'Tom', 'sister', 'Chloe', 'Emily', 'Mortimer', 'very', 'deeply', 'love', 'Chris', 'father', 'Alec', 'Brian', 'Cox', 'also', 'impressed', 'Chris', 'being', 'groomed', 'Chloe', 'future', 'husband', 'glittering', 'business', 'career', 'one', 'Alec', 'companies.Chris', 'quickly', 'seduced', 'Chloe', 'life', 'wealth', 'comfort', 'family', 'offers', 'one', 'barrier', 'path', 'life', 'success', 'affluence', 'badly', 'smitten', 'Tom', 'fiancee', 'Nola', 'played', 'Scarlett', 'Johanssen', 'Perhaps', 'most', 'implausible', 'many', 'unlikely', 'elements', 'film', 'Scarlett', 'Johanssen', 'character', 'failing', 'actress', 'suggestion', 'confidence', 'interviews', 'hard', 'credit', 'smouldering', 'femme', 'fatale', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'unable', 'land', 'acting', 'roles.The', 'love', 'triangle', 'Chris', 'Nola', 'Chloe', 'steadily', 'inexorably', 'disaster', 'not', 'disaster', 'viewer', 'can', 'see', 'coming', 'first', 'Chris', 'be', 'faced', 'choice', 'one', 'side', 'wealthy', 'comfortable', 'life', 'woman', 'who', 'other', 'poverty', 'woman', 'who', 'really', 'are', 'never', 'quite', 'sure', 'truly', 'choice', 'actually', 'much', 'darker.Emily', 'Mortimer', 'great', 'danger', 'getting', 'typecast', 'nice', 'girl', 'who', 'badly', 'man', 'who', 'down', 'perhaps', 'because', 'Sleeping', 'Dictionary', 'Young', 'Adam', 'very', 'well.Besides', 'Rhys', 'Meyers', 'Johanssen', 'Mortimer', 'rest', 'cast', 'are', 'excellent', 'including', 'James', 'Nesbitt', 'police', 'detective.The', 'shared', 'taste', 'Chris', 'initial', 'introduction', 'Tom', 'family', 'love', 'Opera', 'soundtrack', 'many', 'opera', 'greats', 'including', 'arias', 'La', 'Traviata', 'Rigoletto', 'Macbeth', 'recent', 'performances', 'old', 'recordings', 'Caruso', 'others.The', 'biggest', 'issue', 'many', 'people', 'especially', 'who', 'know', 'London', 'well', 'will', 'have', 'film', 'credibility', 'conclusion', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'anyone', 'can', 'have', 'told', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'Britain', 'fifth', 'world', 'CCTV', 'cameras', 'London', 'more', 'other', 'city', 'earth', 'say', 'more', 'would', 'give', 'away', 'ending.Overall', 'was', 'clever', 'stylish', 'film', ""'m"", 'glad', 'watched', 'would', 'put', 'down', 'as', 'one', 'rent', 'rather', 'buy']",Match Point

As it is though, ""Match Point"" creates a new category of Allen misstep: the quasi-thriller...deadly serious and deadly dull.Allen's serious films like ""Interiors,"" ""Another Woman"" and ""Crimes and Misdemeanors"" to name a few are some of his best work. But ""Match Point,"" set in England and starring a gorgeous Scarlett Johansson as Nola and a strange, distant, demonic Jonathan Rhys-Meyers as Chris is so over the top serious in a penny mellerdrammer way that I felt that, at several points in the movie, the cast would burst into laughter, turn to the audience and yell: the joke is on YOU!In a story very similar to Theodore Dreiser's ""An American Tragedy,"" made in the mid 50's as ""A Place in the Sun,"" Allen attempts to update the story of a poor but ambitious guy, Chris who lucks into an affair and marriage to a rich, devoted woman (Emily Mortimer as Chloe') but can't stay away from a poor, struggling actress Nola (Johansson).

One of his students is a wealthy man about his age, who takes an immediate liking to Chris, especially when he finds Chris is fond of opera.  He invites Chris to the opera to share his family's box.  At the opera, the man's sister (Cloe) takes and immediate liking to Chris.  Pretty soon they are dating.  Chris seems to be real happy and since Cloe's family likes Chris too, Cloe's father offers Chris a high level job in one of his companies.  This seems to be the rags to riches story until he meets his friend's fianc&eacute;e Nola (Scarlett Johannsen) and immediately is overpowered by her looks.  The four periodically double date and Chris and Nola seem to flirt with each other when they can.His infatuation with Nola seems pretty evident when he shows his immediate disappointment when Cloe turns down a double date.  Chris hems and haws but finally convinces Cloe to accept the date.  His night gets ruined though because Nola fails to show up due to a headache.One day on the parents estate, Chris and Cloe get entangled in a secret tryst.  With that behind them, Chris is due to be married to Cloe and seems to be doing quite well as an executive in her father's company.  Nola and her fianc&eacute;e break up and Chris cannot go on with enjoying what he has.  Instead he tries to track down Nola who has left the country.Chris and Cloe get married and they immediately start trying to have a baby.  It becomes an obsession for Cloe who wants three.  One day while wandering an art gallery with Cloe, Chris espies Nola walking.  She apparently has returned.  Chris decides to take the plunge that will only lead to ruin to his seemingly ""perfect"" life and pursues Nola.I liked this movie from start to finish.

977675,ATNX84AGYIN39,B000EQHXNW,"Michael Roffman ""pinball wizard""","[7, 10]","Having seen Woody Allen's Annie Hall at such a cynical, nearly adult-like age (about two to three weeks ago), I quickly fell in love with the thin Jew who lives behind Coke bottle glasses. Although his works in recent memory haven't been quite memorable (e.g. The Curse of the Jade Scorpion, Hollywood Ending, the disastrous Celebrity and the disregarded Melinda and Melinda), there was something about Match Point that struck somewhere in the realm of classy.Scarlett Johansson, who might be remembered as the dull figure from the dry and morose Lost in Translation (yes, I indeed hated the film), lights up the screen alongside Jonathan Rhys-Meyers. The two find themselves in a heated love story that takes elements of 2004's Closer, the gritty dark persona of human life in Unfaithful, and the ridiculous and moronic elite of any Oscar Wilde play. The story starts with the introduction of pretty boy Chris Wilton - a successful tennis pro that comes to teach London's wealthy residents. Through his new career, Chris (Rhys-Meyers) finds a future in one of his client's sisters, Chloe (Emily Mortimer). In a seemingly happy and surreal attempt at a marriage, the white road is offset by an affair Chris decides to attempt with Nola (Johansson) - who is to be wed to Chloe's brother. I think America's seen enough soap operas to know what happens next - or at least to have some expectations.Allen takes the simple, standard love affair of Match Point and strikes it repeatedly with twists both on an emotional platform and on the usual thrill ride that is offered at most of film's carnivals. For the first time in ages, Allen dives deep into the characters and reveals an almost neo-realist outlook on the persona of every character he creates. The emotions are raw, and, while the story is standard flair and foam, Allen throws in elements of Dostoevsky and nearly depicts an adaptation of Crime and Punishment.Everything works here, and the film bites both the heart and the lips. It's tense, bewildering, and all at once exciting to the point where the viewer is as unsure of what will happen next as the characters are with their own choices. Great developments in the themes of guilt and conscience are presented, and while the love story may have some smiling, the conclusion, and rather dark underbelly of the film, will have others dwindling.Match Point is without a doubt one of the finest films of its genre and one of the first. There is something here both recognizable and new; I'm still uncertain.

977676,A1PW6G3EFXCLFJ,B000EQHXNW,"Michael W. Kennedy ""insane book lover""","[3, 4]","MATCH POINT is a Woody Allen film without Woody Allen and reminds me of his CRIMES AND MISDEMEANERS. MATCH POINT has that same theme of a man entangled with two women and having to choose between good and evil as did CRIMES. It has that same serious, melancholy feeling to it as well. In both cases, things work out but don't end well. In MATCH POINT we have an ex-tennis pro from humble a background named Chris who becomes involved with Chloe, a rich girl. But then Chris meets meets Nola, the girlfriend of his potentially future brother-in-law. He is much more attracted to Nola but marriage to Chloe promises a properous and comfortable life for him. It's a hard choice, usually made by attractive women who pick wealthy men over better-looking alternatives. Although, perhaps in the case of women, sex appeal is not as important as security. For men, sexual attraction is very high on their list if not at the top. So, in a way, MATCH POINT is formulated on shaky psychological/sociological grounds, namely, that a man like Chris would give up good sex for lots of money. Think about it: Chris is attractive, already a successful tennis player, could make a decent living as a tennis pro and is sharp enough to do any number of things. Yet, he seems intent on being rich. And while being rich is the apparent motivation for his later moral choices, to me there doesn't seem to be much development of that motivation in the script. All we know is that Chris came from a modest background. Apparently, he is just lazy and doesn't really want to work. That is certainly a character flaw behind many an evil deed. But that is only my guess; it would be nice to have that idea, if true for the character, developed more in the screenplay. We are talking about some serious stuff here and at the end we really don't understand why Chris behaved as he did. Still, this is just a fun quibble. MATCH POINT is a good film and I'm glad to see Woody Allen back making good films once again.",4,MOTIVATIONS A BIT OF A MYSTERY BUT OVERALL A GOOD FILM,1149552000,"06 6, 2006",2006,1984,"['MATCH', 'POINT', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'film', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'CRIMES', 'AND', 'MISDEMEANERS', 'MATCH', 'POINT', 'same', 'theme', 'man', 'entangled', 'two', 'women', 'having', 'choose', 'good', 'evil', 'did', 'CRIMES', 'same', 'serious', 'melancholy', 'feeling', 'as', 'well', 'cases', 'things', 'work', 'out', 'do', ""n't"", 'end', 'well', 'MATCH', 'POINT', 'have', 'ex-tennis', 'pro', 'humble', 'background', 'named', 'Chris', 'who', 'involved', 'Chloe', 'rich', 'girl', 'then', 'Chris', 'meets', 'Nola', 'girlfriend', 'potentially', 'future', 'brother-in-law', 'much', 'more', 'attracted', 'Nola', 'marriage', 'Chloe', 'properous', 'comfortable', 'life', 'hard', 'choice', 'usually', 'made', 'attractive', 'women', 'who', 'pick', 'wealthy', 'men', 'better-looking', 'alternatives', 'perhaps', 'case', 'women', 'sex', 'appeal', 'not', 'as', 'important', 'security', 'men', 'sexual', 'attraction', 'very', 'high', 'list', 'not', 'top', 'So', 'way', 'MATCH', 'POINT', 'formulated', 'shaky', 'psychological/sociological', 'grounds', 'namely', 'man', 'Chris', 'would', 'give', 'up', 'good', 'sex', 'lots', 'money', 'Think', 'Chris', 'attractive', 'already', 'successful', 'tennis', 'player', 'could', 'make', 'decent', 'living', 'tennis', 'pro', 'sharp', 'enough', 'do', 'number', 'things', 'Yet', 'intent', 'being', 'rich', 'being', 'rich', 'apparent', 'motivation', 'later', 'moral', 'choices', 'there', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'much', 'development', 'motivation', 'script', 'know', 'Chris', 'came', 'modest', 'background', 'Apparently', 'just', 'lazy', ""n't"", 'really', 'want', 'work', 'certainly', 'character', 'flaw', 'many', 'evil', 'deed', 'only', 'guess', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'have', 'idea', 'true', 'character', 'developed', 'more', 'screenplay', 'are', 'talking', 'serious', 'stuff', 'here', 'end', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'Chris', 'behaved', 'did', 'Still', 'just', 'fun', 'quibble', 'MATCH', 'POINT', 'good', 'film', ""'m"", 'glad', 'see', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'back', 'making', 'good', 'films', 'once', 'again']",Match Point

Thus begins Woody Allen's ""Match Point,"" as Chris Wylton (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers), the film's protagonist and anti-hero, demonstrates the truth of that statement in the bleakest way possible. Chris, a tennis pro from a poor family, is taken by the wealthy lifestyle of his new upper-class friends, the Hewetts, and begins a romance with Chloe (Emily Mortimer), the sweet, pretty but somewhat conventional daughter of the family. Chris' plans to enter the Hewetts' privileged world, however, are shaken when he meets Nola (Scarlett Johansson), the current girlfriend of Chloe's brother Tom (Matthew Goode). Nola, an aspiring actress also from the wrong side of the tracks, is sexy and enticing in a way Chloe could never aspire to be, and Chris soons finds himself obsessed with Nola even as he still courts Chloe. However, just as you think that this is going to become a standard Allen drama of adultery and confused emotions, Allen suddenly makes a U-turn into a far more dire scenario. Chris is shown reading ""Crime and Punishment"" early in the film, and suffice it to say that ""Match Point"" contains aspects of that story, as well as ""An American Tragedy,"" Allen's own ""Crimes and Misdemeanors,"" and the works of Thomas Hardy and Jim Thompson. The film could have been tightened a little, particularly toward the middle, but ""Match Point"" still ranks as the most intelligent and thought-provoking of Allen's recent movies, and the least like a retread of his previous work. There is very little humor, however, in ""Match Point,"" and the ending is so corrosively cynical that some viewers may have trouble digesting it. It helps that, once again, Allen has chosen his cast impeccably. Scarlett Johansson may well be the most interesting young actress in movies today, as well as the sexiest, and Rhys-Meyers oozes reptilian charm as Chris. (Rhys-Meyers recently won a Golden Globe for his excellent portrayal of Elvis Presley in a TV miniseries, and in some scenes in ""Match Point"" he looks like Elvis' evil twin.) There is also fine work from Mortimer and Goode; from Brian Cox and Penelope Wilton as their parents; and from such stalwarts of British rep as James Nesbitt, Ewen Bremner, and Margaret Tyzack.",4,Woody's most interesting film in years.,1137801600,"01 21, 2006",2006,2293,"['man', 'who', 'said', 'more', 'important', 'be', 'lucky', 'good', 'knew', 'lot', 'life', 'Thus', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'Match', 'Point', 'Chris', 'Wylton', 'Jonathan', 'Rhys-Meyers', 'film', 'protagonist', 'anti-hero', 'truth', 'statement', 'bleakest', 'way', 'possible', 'Chris', 'tennis', 'pro', 'poor', 'family', 'taken', 'wealthy', 'lifestyle', 'new', 'upper-class', 'friends', 'Hewetts', 'romance', 'Chloe', 'Emily', 'Mortimer', 'sweet', 'pretty', 'somewhat', 'conventional', 'daughter', 'family', 'Chris', 'plans', 'enter', 'Hewetts', 'privileged', 'world', 'however', 'are', 'shaken', 'when', 'Nola', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'current', 'girlfriend', 'Chloe', 'brother', 'Tom', 'Matthew', 'Goode', 'Nola', 'aspiring', 'actress', 'also', 'wrong', 'side', 'tracks', 'sexy', 'enticing', 'way', 'Chloe', 'could', 'never', 'aspire', 'be', 'Chris', 'soons', 'obsessed', 'Nola', 'even', 'still', 'Chloe', 'However', 'just', 'think', 'going', 'become', 'standard', 'Allen', 'drama', 'adultery', 'confused', 'emotions', 'Allen', 'suddenly', 'U-turn', 'far', 'more', 'dire', 'scenario', 'Chris', 'shown', 'reading', 'Crime', 'Punishment', 'early', 'film', 'suffice', 'say', 'Match', 'Point', 'aspects', 'story', 'as', 'well', 'American', 'Tragedy', 'Allen', 'own', 'Crimes', 'Misdemeanors', 'works', 'Thomas', 'Hardy', 'Jim', 'Thompson', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'tightened', 'little', 'particularly', 'middle', 'Match', 'Point', 'still', 'most', 'intelligent', 'thought-provoking', 'Allen', 'recent', 'movies', 'least', 'retread', 'previous', 'work', 'very', 'little', 'humor', 'however', 'Match', 'Point', 'ending', 'so', 'corrosively', 'cynical', 'viewers', 'may', 'have', 'trouble', 'digesting', 'once', 'again', 'Allen', 'chosen', 'cast', 'impeccably', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'may', 'well', 'be', 'most', 'interesting', 'young', 'actress', 'movies', 'today', 'as', 'well', 'sexiest', 'Rhys-Meyers', 'oozes', 'reptilian', 'charm', 'Chris', 'Rhys-Meyers', 'recently', 'won', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'excellent', 'portrayal', 'Elvis', 'Presley', 'TV', 'miniseries', 'scenes', 'Match', 'Point', 'Elvis', 'evil', 'twin', 'also', 'fine', 'work', 'Mortimer', 'Goode', 'Brian', 'Cox', 'Penelope', 'Wilton', 'parents', 'such', 'stalwarts', 'British', 'rep', 'James', 'Nesbitt', 'Ewen', 'Bremner', 'Margaret', 'Tyzack']",Match Point

Chloe's heart is set on marrying Chris -after she first finagles him a high-paying, upwardly mobile career in her father's business. For Chris, it's the chance of a lifetime. But there is always Nola, whose sensuality is difficult to resist. And Nola is trouble.""Match Point"" recalls writer/director Woody Allen's earlier and greater film ""Crimes and Misdemeanors"", but with attractive young stars and a focus on the role luck plays in its characters' fates. It doesn't engage the audience the way Allen's best films do, perhaps because it's not as emotionally credible. And it runs a little too long. But the cast is talented and attractive. Chris and Nola are both ambitious souls who know how to exploit the guilt of rich people. And I might add that they both know how to pout to great effect. It's only a shame that Emily Mortimer is overshadowed by her co-stars. It is strange to see Mortimer playing a plain woman slighted for the younger, sexier Johanssen, when Mortimer is quite a bombshell herself. ""Match Point"" isn't a great film, but it's enjoyable.

Yet, it had some very valid points that I didn't consider until the plot got rolling.Johnathan Rhys-Meyers plays Chris, a tennis pro who is looking to establish himself.  After landing a job as a tennis pro at an English country club, he meets Tom, a member, and the two become friends despite their social standig.  Eventually his sister, Chloe, falls for him and the two begin seeing each other.  Chris, however, developes an infatuation with Nola (Scarlette Johansen), Tom's girlfriend.  The two of them are outsiders to Tom and Chloe's family (a borish American actress and a tennis pro), but Chris is accepted as they see him as having potential while Nola is looking to hitch her wagon to wealth and privilage.  Chris would prove himself to be such a man as well, but it will reveil itself as the movie progresses.  Nola and Chris will have one encounter, but she disappears once Tom and her split.  Months later, she reappears after Chris and Chloe are married, and they take up with the affair once again.Chris changes during this time.  While he is first seen as an all around ""nice guy"" who made a mistake with Nola, he shows another side of himself.  He is concerned with social climbing, wanting the wealth and privilage of the Hewitt family.  He is bored being married to Chloe, but realizes she is part of his all too important image.  He's married to the boss's daughter, he's being groomed to fill the old man's place someday, and he needs a wife and family to add to his all too important image.  He tries to juggle both women at the same time, but finds Nola is demanding more and more of his time.  Eventually, he devises a plot to eliminate Nola all together once she gives him an ultimatum - run off with me or I'll tell everyone you got me pregnant.  He murderes Nola, makes it look like a burglary, and, strangely enough, gets away with it even though he's questioned by the police with a telltale diary.What does this say about human nature?  Funny how our needs and wants change with circumstance.  Chris wants the beautiful bombshell, then once he gets her he doesn't want what he's got.  Nola resists her urges for Chris when she is with Tom, but once she gives in she seems to have no qualms about their affair and wants more from him.  Tom wants a gorgeous, exciting woman like Nola, but disposes of her to marry a more respectable woman in the end.  And look at all the people who fell in line with the plot who suffered (the neighbor lady in Nola's apartment building).A new twist for a Woody Allen movie.

Then as the ball hits the top of the net and lies perilously poised the voice says, ""Life is luck.  The ball goes over the net, you win the point.  If the ball lands on your side, you lose the point.""Thus begins Woody Allen's newest and one of his most brilliant movies Match Point.  As do most of Mr. Allen's dramatic movies do, this one struggles with the inherent matter of good and bad luck in one's life and the inherent goodness of people.  Reminiscent of the truly brilliant Crimes and Misdemeanors, Match Point is one of Allen's finest films in the last five years in my opinion.Chris Wilton, played by John Rhys-Meyers, has had a mediocre career a a tennis player.  Rejecting the tournament scene, he opts to teach tennis at an exclusive club.  By day a tennis teacher during his free time he is busy reinventing himself from humble beginnings in Ireland to a man of sophistication and class. But he is pretty much of a fraud as he reads the companion books to Dostoevsky's masterpieces and professes to love opera but is bored beyond belief while attending the real thing.  But all of his rehearsing is put to the test when he meets a polished young man who brings him to his family home and his sister is smitten with him. While Chris takes an interest in Chloe or so it appears, his real interest is in thebrash young would be actress and temptress Nola played by ScarlettJohansson.  And now the stage is set for a movie experience fraught with tension as all the while the viewer knows that Allen will provide us not only with a great movie experience but a chance to question our very own morals and the question of luck.I must admit that I found the movie was a bit long at times and a bit dull until the defining moment when I realized the brilliance of this movie.  In addition the English settings of the countryside and the city of London were almost like being there.  I wondered as I thought about this movie if the movie might have taken place elsewhere but came to the conclusion that the story lent itself to the English of wealth that England was the perfect place for this film.But most of all it was the performances which really made me feel as if these people weren't actors but I had a front row seat into their lives with a pair of good binoculars.  Ms. Johansson at such a young age captured the essence of the brash Nola and played her with an edge hardly seen today.  And Mr. Rhys-Meyers, who recently won a Golden Globe award for his portrayal of Elvis, depicted Chris Wilton with an equal amount of poise and sophistication almost as if he indeed was this character.  An equally superb performance was given by Emily Mortimer as Chloe, a lovely but terribly boring wife.A lover of Mr. Allen's comedy since first seeing him on the Tonight Show and his first film Bananas, his recent films have left me wanting for more. But Match Point most assuredly  revived my love for the serious side of Mr. Allen's work.  Best of all this film has left wanting to see Crimes and Misdemeanors and pondering the moral and ethical questions both movies raise.  I highly recommend this movie to all. Finally I wonder if I will ever look at a ball and a net in just the same way as I did before seeing this film.",5,Woody Allen At His Best,1137888000,"01 22, 2006",2006,3346,"['opening', 'scene', 'move', 'tennis', 'ball', 'being', 'hit', 'narrator', ""'d"", 'rather', 'be', 'lucky', 'smart', 'Then', 'ball', 'top', 'net', 'perilously', 'poised', 'voice', 'Life', 'luck', 'ball', 'net', 'win', 'point', 'ball', 'side', 'lose', 'point', 'Thus', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'newest', 'one', 'most', 'brilliant', 'movies', 'Match', 'Point', 'do', 'most', 'Mr.', 'Allen', 'dramatic', 'movies', 'do', 'one', 'inherent', 'matter', 'good', 'bad', 'luck', 'one', 'life', 'inherent', 'goodness', 'people', 'Reminiscent', 'truly', 'brilliant', 'Crimes', 'Misdemeanors', 'Match', 'Point', 'one', 'Allen', 'finest', 'films', 'last', 'five', 'years', 'opinion.Chris', 'Wilton', 'played', 'John', 'Rhys-Meyers', 'had', 'mediocre', 'career', 'tennis', 'player', 'Rejecting', 'tournament', 'scene', 'teach', 'tennis', 'exclusive', 'club', 'day', 'tennis', 'teacher', 'free', 'time', 'busy', 'reinventing', 'humble', 'beginnings', 'Ireland', 'man', 'sophistication', 'class', 'pretty', 'much', 'fraud', 'companion', 'books', 'Dostoevsky', 'masterpieces', 'professes', 'love', 'opera', 'bored', 'belief', 'attending', 'real', 'thing', 'rehearsing', 'put', 'test', 'when', 'polished', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'family', 'home', 'sister', 'smitten', 'Chris', 'interest', 'Chloe', 'so', 'real', 'interest', 'thebrash', 'young', 'would', 'be', 'actress', 'temptress', 'Nola', 'played', 'ScarlettJohansson', 'now', 'stage', 'set', 'movie', 'experience', 'fraught', 'tension', 'viewer', 'Allen', 'will', 'provide', 'not', 'only', 'great', 'movie', 'experience', 'chance', 'question', 'very', 'own', 'morals', 'question', 'luck.I', 'must', 'admit', 'found', 'movie', 'was', 'bit', 'long', 'times', 'bit', 'dull', 'defining', 'moment', 'when', 'realized', 'brilliance', 'movie', 'addition', 'English', 'settings', 'countryside', 'city', 'London', 'were', 'almost', 'being', 'there', 'wondered', 'thought', 'movie', 'movie', 'might', 'have', 'taken', 'place', 'elsewhere', 'came', 'conclusion', 'story', 'lent', 'English', 'wealth', 'England', 'was', 'perfect', 'place', 'most', 'was', 'performances', 'really', 'made', 'feel', 'people', 'were', ""n't"", 'actors', 'had', 'front', 'row', 'seat', 'lives', 'pair', 'good', 'binoculars', 'Ms.', 'Johansson', 'young', 'age', 'captured', 'essence', 'brash', 'Nola', 'played', 'edge', 'hardly', 'seen', 'today', 'Mr.', 'Rhys-Meyers', 'who', 'recently', 'won', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'award', 'portrayal', 'Elvis', 'depicted', 'Chris', 'Wilton', 'equal', 'amount', 'poise', 'sophistication', 'almost', 'indeed', 'was', 'character', 'equally', 'superb', 'performance', 'was', 'given', 'Emily', 'Mortimer', 'Chloe', 'lovely', 'terribly', 'boring', 'wife.A', 'lover', 'Mr.', 'Allen', 'comedy', 'first', 'seeing', 'Tonight', 'Show', 'first', 'film', 'Bananas', 'recent', 'films', 'have', 'left', 'wanting', 'more', 'Match', 'Point', 'most', 'assuredly', 'revived', 'love', 'serious', 'side', 'Mr.', 'Allen', 'work', 'Best', 'film', 'left', 'wanting', 'see', 'Crimes', 'Misdemeanors', 'pondering', 'moral', 'ethical', 'questions', 'movies', 'raise', 'highly', 'recommend', 'movie', 'Finally', 'wonder', 'will', 'ever', 'look', 'ball', 'net', 'just', 'same', 'way', 'did', 'seeing', 'film']",Match Point

I haven't seen the film Crimes and Misdemoneanors but I still felt like I've here before.  Two thirds of the film reminds me of the Julia Roberts's film Closer with out the crude language.  It was impossible to connect with Chris's (Jonathan Rhys Meyers)charcter, an ambitious ex-tennis pro who seems to navigate fairly easily up the social ladder and who showed early signs of craziness becomes obsessed with a woman who he only wants as a playmate.  Typical.  Nola's character doesn't seem as consistent.  She is this aggressive woman who shows a zest for life-then when she hooks up with Chris, she's sudden a very needy woman who needs everything spelled out to her.  Any femme fatale worth their salt would have weighed this situation differently.  Chris was a man who would have had nothing if he'd left his wife.  As harsh as this sounds-she would have been better off remaining the mistress of a wealthy man than the wife of a broke one.

This is all fine and dandy, but he already basically the same plot line with Crimes and Misdemeanors. With slight alterations, change of locale and personnel, viola you have new movie. Or you have the same movie with different fleas.The performances and acting are great overall, with Jonathan Rhys and Billy Cox taking the lead. It's Scarlett's performance which leaves much to be desired. She is out of her league with acting of this caliber and does not fit in.Of course, movies in general do not come close to the depth of the novel, nor should they. Crime and Punishment is a work of great spiritual and psychological detail. Moreover, the main character has a much greater moral dilemma to deal with. The kinds of problems that Allen's characters have to deal with pale in comparison.In a way, Allen tries to make his criminals look excusable for what they did. But it really is hard to forgive a married man for infidelity and murder. It's not very far reaching in its implications and doesn't really have a cosmic ring to it.I suppose this kind of movie is considered sophisticated in this day and age, where people don't read or understand literature. And Allen is no exception or else he would not have taken such creative license with such an important literary work. It only scratches the bare surface of the great Russian novels, and in the end does them a great injustice.Movies are much better off on their own, than alluding to great writings that require much more time and work to understand.

977696,A1D3XQC2DIT,B000EQHXNW,Peter Shermeta,"[12, 16]","I do not know exactly what I had expected the title to mean, but whatever it was, I was wrong. I think I had imagined something having to do with matches and fire. The title, I thought, was perfect for the film. It is a reference to the game of tennis where either in your favor or against you, the fate of the match potentially rests in the outcome of this one point. It could go either way. The theme from the movie that each situation, each conversation, could go either way depending on nothing more than a whim, was pulled together with those two words which combine as figurehead for the movie. I liked that a lot. And over the 2 hours and 4 minutes at which Match Point weighs in, I liked almost nothing else.I did like the performance by Matthew Goode who played Tom Hewett. He is sort of...if Hugh Grant and Tom Cavanagh had a baby. Charming, British and yet gangly and awkward.I was not at all impressed with Jonathan Rhys Meyers. Though as I recall, the good things I had heard from my sister-in-law may not have mentioned anything beyond his good looks. I thought his acting was forced and choppy. As the movie began I thought his acting would ruin the movie. Then I remembered that Scarlett Johansson was in it, too. (That means it would be her acting that would stand out as the low-point.) He seemed overly dramatic at times as if his talent may be more fitting for on-stage rather than on-screen. Besides, he looks and sounds a little too much like Joaquin Phoenix (think about it).Just as she does in all of her movies, Ms. Johansson underwhelmed me yet again. Her delivery seems completely devoid of emotion and a passion for her craft. It is probably best noted from her performance in In Good Company, but it surfaced again here. I have seen the same lists as you, where she is listed near the top of the hottest and the sexiest actors. I have read the same articles as you, where she is touted as the first and only actress to define our generation with her grace and natural ability while the camera rolls. I just have not seen it for myself. To me she is best suited for awkward, angsty teen roles like the one she played in Ghost World.I was just reading an IMDb forum spoiler discussion on the movie and someone pointed out an interesting parallel between one of the characters in the film and a book read by one of the characters. I love subtle references like this, even when, like this one, I have not read the book. Kudos to Woody Allen for that.I wish I could give Mr. Allen more credit in my thoughts on his work. I have not seen what many consider his best films, but of the others I have seen I have not been a fan. To that point, however, some have gone so far as to call Match Point his crowning achievement. I guess I just do not understand his genius. So many people talk about what the man is able to do and it must be entirely over my head.The synopsis provided with the DVD mentions mystery where the only real mystery was when was the movie going to finally end. It also includes a quote that refers to Match Point as one of the most erotic movies in years. The most erotic point was when Rhys-Meyers was saturating Ms. Johansson with massage oil. She's completely covered from the viewer's standpoint and looks like she needs a magazine to cure her boredom. It looked like the cover from a cheap steamy-romance novel. I say cheap because I bet Rhys-Meyers's scrawny frame doesn't tip the scales at more than 160 pounds.Regardless of lofty promises and salesmanship on behalf of the promoters of the DVD, the movie was a disappointment. I cannot remember a time when I have had such an urge to get up and turn off a movie. And I probably would have had I not been entertaining guests.

977697,A2B8G7W3JXKMZA,B000EQHXNW,"Randolph Bradley ""RBJ""","[5, 8]","Before Match Point, I felt that Woody Allen was a boring pseudo-intellectual American with too much angst, low self-esteem, and envy for ""immortal"" concepts (such as God, Divine Providence, and immortality), who was made famous by other Americans like himself.Granted, there are many points made by Allen over the years, which have aggrandized the legacy of East Coast Brahmins, in general, but, to me, he and they, have been just too, too, too boring.  Moreover, I just wished they could be more like the Europeans (e.g. the French), whom they seemed to ""imitate"" in a grudging ungracious manner.  Of course, it's moot to argue that American culture depends on old Latin and Anglo-Saxon culture for its very existence, but these days there are all kinds of people, from all kinds of places, who make bold statements with no basis in history, truth, experience, or reason.  I would expect them to not understand this review in any way.However, in Match Point, Woody has grown past his adolescent neuroses and created a world-class film, about very universal concepts.  Luckily, most reviews seem to concur that this film deals deftly with social classes, gender, love, lust, fear, guilt, and punishment.  This movie takes Woody's former pre-occupation with neurosis and synthesizes all into a screenplay that combines all the quirky idiosyncrasies common to rich intellectuals and makes them very believable and full of pathos.  (That's if you believe that even this film is anecdotal, in a sense.)  Before, I never sympathized with any Allen characters, at all.  This time, I felt genuine emotion for just about everyone (smile).What I loved most about this movie is summarized by the tennis game theory of match point.  When the ball hits the net, it stalls, and then falls backward from the net or forward over the net.  If it falls backward, the player loses, if it falls forward, the player wins.  Either way, the game ends.When that ring hits the wall and falls backward, we just know that Chris has lost, not the material comforts he bargained for, but self-esteem, joy, and inner peace.  He will probably, forever, have to entertain Nola and her neighbor as his ""confidants"" for eternity (in bed, on the streets, at dinner, . . . ).Such a tragic thought, but a form of justice.",5,Woody Allen transcends to world class,1146355200,"04 30, 2006",2006,2285,"['Match', 'Point', 'felt', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'was', 'boring', 'pseudo-intellectual', 'American', 'too', 'much', 'angst', 'low', 'self-esteem', 'envy', 'immortal', 'concepts', 'such', 'God', 'Divine', 'Providence', 'immortality', 'who', 'was', 'made', 'famous', 'other', 'Americans', 'himself.Granted', 'are', 'many', 'points', 'made', 'Allen', 'years', 'have', 'aggrandized', 'legacy', 'East', 'Coast', 'Brahmins', 'general', 'have', 'been', 'just', 'too', 'too', 'too', 'boring', 'Moreover', 'just', 'wished', 'could', 'be', 'more', 'Europeans', 'e.g', 'French', 'whom', 'seemed', 'imitate', 'grudging', 'ungracious', 'manner', 'course', 'moot', 'argue', 'American', 'culture', 'old', 'Latin', 'Anglo-Saxon', 'culture', 'very', 'existence', 'days', 'are', 'kinds', 'people', 'kinds', 'places', 'who', 'make', 'bold', 'statements', 'basis', 'history', 'truth', 'experience', 'reason', 'would', 'expect', 'not', 'understand', 'review', 'way.However', 'Match', 'Point', 'Woody', 'grown', 'adolescent', 'neuroses', 'created', 'world-class', 'film', 'about', 'very', 'universal', 'concepts', 'Luckily', 'most', 'reviews', 'seem', 'concur', 'film', 'deftly', 'social', 'classes', 'gender', 'love', 'lust', 'fear', 'guilt', 'punishment', 'movie', 'Woody', 'former', 'pre-occupation', 'neurosis', 'synthesizes', 'screenplay', 'quirky', 'idiosyncrasies', 'common', 'rich', 'intellectuals', 'very', 'believable', 'full', 'pathos', 'believe', 'even', 'film', 'anecdotal', 'sense', 'never', 'sympathized', 'Allen', 'characters', 'time', 'felt', 'genuine', 'emotion', 'just', 'everyone', 'smile', '.What', 'loved', 'most', 'movie', 'summarized', 'tennis', 'game', 'theory', 'match', 'point', 'When', 'ball', 'net', 'then', 'backward', 'net', 'forward', 'net', 'backward', 'player', 'forward', 'player', 'way', 'game', 'ends.When', 'ring', 'hits', 'wall', 'backward', 'just', 'know', 'Chris', 'lost', 'not', 'material', 'bargained', 'self-esteem', 'joy', 'inner', 'peace', 'will', 'probably', 'forever', 'have', 'entertain', 'Nola', 'neighbor', 'confidants', 'eternity', 'bed', 'streets', 'dinner', 'tragic', 'thought', 'form', 'justice']",Match Point

As a fan of Allen's movies, I took that as quite a recommendation.  However, I had no other advance information about the movie except that it involved tennis.I won't attempt to try and spell out the plot because I enjoyed the movie as much as I did by not having any preconceptions.  However, it is a morality play that examines the role of fate (luck) in our lives.  As the movies unfolds and the characters develop, we find ourselves getting involved with the ""hero"".  We agonize over his decisions and his behavior primarily because the director enabled us to know him so well.  If, at times, the movie seems to creep along, it is because Allen knows how to properly set the stage.  When things do happen quickly, everything we've learned comes into play and we are rewarded for our attentiveness.This is a movie where you find yourself knowing what you'd do in the same situation but agonizing over what the main character will do.

The movie held our attention right to the end, not out of any sense of greatness, more out of a manipulated sense of morbid curiousity.  One can't help but try and make predictions as the end nears, but unless someone told you of the conclusion, you won't be right.Once the movie is over we felt no need to watch it again.

977701,AFJFXN42RZ3G2,B000EQHXNW,"R. DelParto ""Rose2""","[2, 2]","Woody Allen has made quite a turn with Match Point.  The film is a change from the humor and the landscape that moviegoers have grown accustomed to - the New York state of mind.  This time it is the English landscape with a bit of London haze.  Indeed, Match Point possesses elements of an Alfred Hitchcock thriller, and a little bit romantic entanglement that one would see on a daytime soap opera.  However, the most interesting part of the film is the core theme of wealth and prestige, and the cultural aesthetics that go along with it - the game of tennis and a rich taste for the arts.Match Point involves the story of Chris (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) and his rise from a tennis instructor to a top-notch stock market executive.  During the beginning of the film Chris appears to be the well-rounded good guy who is supportive of his friends.  He falls for and marries his tennis client's sister, Chloe (Emily Mortimer).  However, under that good guy exterior, being married is not enough.  Chris becomes bored and flirts with his brother-in-law's fiancee, Nola (Scarlet Johannson).  Months later, Nola and Tom (Matthew Goode) break off their engagement, and Nola is now single.  Chris continues his spare time pursuits toward Nola while still being married to Chloe.  The situation gets sticky, and Chris has to find a way to resolve the Nola situation.  Chris tells Nola that he will find a way to tell Chloe about the two of them.  Weeks pass, and nothing happens.  Chris lies about everything.  The tension builds, and he confides with no one.  He eventually resolves the situation on his own with gruesome results.  Indeed, wealth and prestige goes to Chris' head in order to get what he wants.Woody Allen produces a meticulous film that ends with a clean finish.  The screenplay and the production are excellent, and Allen probably takes from literary master Dostoevsky in shaping the character of Chris.  The sound track is impeccable.  Instead of old jazz or pop standards that usual covet the background music of a Woody Allen film, one distinguishable vintage operatic piece as well as others accompanies intense moments in the film.  There are no cinematic feats, but that should not prevent anyone from watching a different Wood Allen film.Overall, the film is recommended for those who like a little suspense in a movie.

You could see the ending coming a mile away, and the more the story went on, the more despicable Johnathan Rhys Meyers' character Chris became.  Maybe this was a comedy, because Allen actually expects people too root for someone this shallow and evil?  Another case in point is that the police working on the murder of his mistress Nola (Scarlett Johansson) and the poor, innocent lady downstairs conducted the sloppiest detective work since Jon Bonet Ramsey.  The girl at the boutique who knew about Nola seeing Chris, and the man he banged into on the street after committing the crime were never questioned?  Worst of all is the ending.

977704,ANUBY6KOT60WH,B000EQHXNW,R. Galeano Valencia,"[1, 3]","I have been a Woody Allen fan forever but was utterly disappointed by his latest ""era"" (being ""Melinda and Melinda""'s fiasco a total trauma for me). However with ""Match Point"" good ol' Woody seems to be making his way to a successful comeback as the beloved writer and director he has always been. ""Match Point"" is a delicate and elegant thriller that has kept me tied to my chair expectantly for its ultimate resolution. The movie has a particular style, very much a-la Hitchcock but still faithful to Allen's own genius. Consistent with Allen's work in NYC, the city of London plays a starring role in the movie and is funny to see how an American director ends up making such a beutiful portrait of a city not quite praised by its own children. Jonathan Rhys-Meyers delivers an impressive performance as the ambitious and young American tennis promise who relocates to London in search of success and ends up marrying the daughter of a wealthy entrepeneur. The marriage means not only financial stability but also the opportunity to step into the rigid upper class London. However, things start to fall apart when he falls madly in love with Nola (Scarlett Johansson), an aspiring actress also struggling her way into the rich and famous. These two ambitious characters collide in an affair that is doomed from the beginning and sparks the series of events that will unfold progressively in the story. The film has a beautiful photography, a superb script and casting, an encompassing an consistent rhythm both in direction as well as in the plot's evolution. And finally, a spectacular music with stunningly beautiful opera pieces like ""Una furtiva lacrima"" from L'elisir d'amore by Gaetano Donizetti, and other masterpieces from Il Trovatore, La Traviata, Rigoletto, Macbeth...

Here he tackles Hitchcock, and though it's been referred to his ""big comeback"", he missed on many levels.Most importantly, Hitch never put so many unlikeable characters in the same film. One, maybe two were enough to keep a Hitchcock plot interesting. With the exception of Emily Mortimer (and maybe Brian Cox), I had no idea where Woody was going with this. Second, Hitchcock relied on music as an integral part of every scene. Woody wasn't as careful, and the score was as bland as the bleak London setting.  Scarlett Johansson was the requisite Hitchcock blonde, but Jonathan Rhys-Meyers was no Cary Grant or Jimmy Stewart or Farley Granger or Joseph Cotton. I couldn't have cared less about him and really wasn't surprised that he behaved with such stupidity. Mr. Rhys-Meyers was certainly centered in his conviction of the character that the script required, but what can you do with a boringly written character? There was little room for him to grow. At the end, he was the same idiot as in the beginning. I guess I was waiting for some Hitchcockian revelation, a surprise...or something. The ending was also non-Hitchcockian, because he usually gave justice to the bad guys. No, this homage to Hitchcock fell flat for me, and Woody's cleverness escaped me. I thought ""Match Point"" was a routine thriller, with some fine performances (especially Emily Mortimer), but I'm not compelled to watch it again.

He's usually derivative and self-absorbed and favors style over content, often to the extreme.  So when I heard ""Woody is back"" with Match Point I was intrigued but not exactly giddy with anticipation.Sitting through the DVD of this -- a DVD without a single Extra Feature or Bonus, by the way -- I had to admit this is probably Woody's best film since Manhattan, but at 2 hours 4 minutes a better editor could have trimmed at least a half hour and prevented the nearly-fatal slump halfway in.The characters are appealingly drawn. Scarlett Johansson is yummy in the Glenn Close role, and Jonathan Rhys Meyers makes a pretty good Jude Law, although the rise of his character Chris from tennis teacher to business magnate is underexplained.  The best member of the cast is Emily Mortimer as Chloe, the wife who doesn't deserve her heartbreak.  She's earnest and bewildered in just the right combination, and stands out as an actor in this cast.Unfortunately the pacing lags, the camera-moves too often mimic Ingmar Bergman, the lighting is noticable (not a good thing) and the monochromatic interior sets are laughably overdone.

This is a story about a former amateur tennis player nameChris Wilton who almost made it big, has now moved to London to be a teacher and ends up at a very exclusive club. He soon gives lessons to a wealthy guy named Tom Hewett (Matthew Goode) and says all the right things (dropping comments about opera) to get invited to a family outing. There he meets Tom's sister Chloe Hewett Wilton (the always excellent Emily Mortimer) and she's immediately smitten. As are their parents Alec (Brian Cox) and Eleanor (Penelope Wilton) as Chris continues to strategically drop things into conversation (in an early scene we see Chris reading, ironically, Crime and Punishment by Fyodor Dostoyevsky with a cheat guide and as Chloe whines to daddy Alec about whether he could help Chris get a leg up in the world, the father notes he and Chris had a really interesting conversation about Dostoyevsky). Chris is smart, savvy and step-by-step working his way into this family and their 1% world of power and wealth and boredom.And then he meets Tom's American fiance Nola (Scarlett Johansson) and becomes obsessed. The film covers most of the &#34;7 deadly sins&#34; as each character is not necessarily &#34;good&#34; and all trying to do whatever they can to get what they want. It is taught, sexy, dark and does not always go where you're expecting which is refreshing considering how many films follow a cookie cutter path.This being a co-production with BBC films and a love letter to London the cast is full of amazing UK actors in roles of varying sizes.

977713,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B000EQHXNW,Roland E. Zwick,"[4, 7]","In ""Match Point,"" Woody Allen, caught in one of his more ""serious"" moods, takes a simple tale about marital infidelity and turns it into something complex and fascinating.  Although he leaves a trail of clues implying that this is to be another of his homages to Fyodor Dostoevsky, the film really turns out to be Allen's own version of Theodore Dreiser's ""An American Tragedy"" (albeit set in England, perhaps to throw us off the scent). The parallels between the two works are not perfect, of course - in fact they often seem to be intentionally inverted - but they are close enough to make us wonder if Allen did, indeed, do it all on purpose.Jonathan Rhys-Meyers plays Chris Wilton, a down-on-his-luck social climber who marries into wealth but longs for the passion he finds with another woman.  Chris is a professional tennis player who decides to leave the circuit when he realizes he hasn't the skill to compete with the real pros.  Taking a job as an instructor at a posh, highly exclusive tennis club, Chris finds himself wining and dining with the rich and famous after one of his pupils, Tom Hewett, takes a liking to him and introduces Chris to his snooty but accepting family.  Chris begins to date Tom's warmhearted sister, Chloe, but he is really smitten by an aspiring American actress, Nola, who just happens to be Tom's fiance.  Chris makes the mistake of marrying Chloe before Tom and Nola call off their engagement and go their separate ways.  The fact that Nola is free but he is not doesn't deter Chris from pursing an affair with the woman who provides all the passion and excitement his loving but boring wife cannot.  But Chris soon discovers that carrying on an affair can result in a life filled with secrecy, lies, guilt and self-loathing.  And when the going gets to be just a bit too much for our hero to handle...well, there`s always that ""final solution"" lurking in the wings, as many an earlier adulterer has discovered to his everlasting regret.""Match Point"" starts off very slowly and seems at first as if it will be just another tale of adultery and unrequited love.  Yet, Allen really knows how to draw us into Chris' predicament, so that, by about halfway into the film, we feel as enmeshed in his seemingly irreconcilable dilemma as he himself is.  Torn between the wealth and position he has as Chloe's husband and the love he feels for the relatively impoverished Nola, Chris is frozen into a state of paralyzing indecisiveness, his every waking moment a tormenting hell of fear and gathering dread as he keeps waiting in breathless anticipation for that other shoe to drop.  It isn't until the ""other woman"" becomes more of a burden than his clinging wife that Chris can finally launch into action.  This turnabout in the screenplay might strike many in the audience as arbitrary and implausible and there is certainly a case to be made for that.  But if you can go with the flow, you will be delighted by all the little ironies Allen throws at us in the final stages of the story, which help to underline the filmmaker's thesis that, for all the efforts we make to control our lives, The Fickle Finger of Fate - or in this case a tennis ball precariously balancing on the top of a net trying to figure out which way to fall - always has the final word.Allen has written dialogue that is incisive, intelligent and literate, and the performances he's drawn from the likes of  Rhys-Meyers, Goode, Emily Mortimer, Scarlett Johannson and Penelope Wilton are superb down to the tiniest detail.  Allen keeps his camera tightly focused on his characters, rarely pulling away from them much beyond a middle distance, keeping us firmly locked in the near-claustrophobic drama.  Here is a movie that demands patience at the beginning but that really sneaks up on you the longer you watch it.Guided by the hands of a master, ""Match Point"" is one of Allen's finest films in years.",4,engrossing tale of adultery and obsession,1137024000,"01 12, 2006",2006,3910,"['Match', 'Point', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'caught', 'one', 'more', 'serious', 'moods', 'simple', 'tale', 'marital', 'infidelity', 'something', 'complex', 'fascinating', 'trail', 'clues', 'implying', 'be', 'homages', 'Fyodor', 'Dostoevsky', 'film', 'really', 'out', 'be', 'Allen', 'own', 'version', 'Theodore', 'Dreiser', 'American', 'Tragedy', 'set', 'England', 'perhaps', 'throw', 'off', 'scent', 'parallels', 'two', 'works', 'are', 'not', 'perfect', 'course', 'fact', 'often', 'seem', 'be', 'intentionally', 'inverted', 'are', 'close', 'enough', 'make', 'wonder', 'Allen', 'did', 'indeed', 'do', 'purpose.Jonathan', 'Rhys-Meyers', 'plays', 'Chris', 'Wilton', 'down-on-his-luck', 'social', 'climber', 'who', 'wealth', 'longs', 'passion', 'woman', 'Chris', 'professional', 'tennis', 'player', 'who', 'leave', 'circuit', 'when', ""n't"", 'skill', 'compete', 'real', 'pros', 'Taking', 'job', 'instructor', 'posh', 'highly', 'exclusive', 'tennis', 'club', 'Chris', 'wining', 'dining', 'rich', 'famous', 'one', 'pupils', 'Tom', 'Hewett', 'liking', 'introduces', 'Chris', 'snooty', 'accepting', 'family', 'Chris', 'date', 'Tom', 'warmhearted', 'sister', 'Chloe', 'really', 'smitten', 'aspiring', 'American', 'actress', 'Nola', 'who', 'just', 'be', 'Tom', 'fiance', 'Chris', 'mistake', 'marrying', 'Chloe', 'Tom', 'Nola', 'call', 'off', 'engagement', 'go', 'separate', 'ways', 'fact', 'Nola', 'free', 'not', ""n't"", 'deter', 'Chris', 'pursing', 'affair', 'woman', 'who', 'passion', 'excitement', 'loving', 'boring', 'wife', 'can', 'not', 'Chris', 'soon', 'carrying', 'affair', 'can', 'result', 'life', 'filled', 'secrecy', 'guilt', 'self-loathing', 'when', 'going', 'be', 'just', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'hero', 'handle', 'well', 's', 'always', 'final', 'solution', 'lurking', 'wings', 'many', 'earlier', 'adulterer', 'discovered', 'everlasting', 'regret', 'Match', 'Point', 'off', 'very', 'slowly', 'first', 'will', 'be', 'just', 'tale', 'adultery', 'unrequited', 'love', 'Allen', 'really', 'how', 'draw', 'Chris', 'predicament', 'halfway', 'film', 'feel', 'enmeshed', 'seemingly', 'irreconcilable', 'dilemma', 'Torn', 'wealth', 'position', 'Chloe', 'husband', 'love', 'relatively', 'impoverished', 'Nola', 'Chris', 'frozen', 'state', 'paralyzing', 'indecisiveness', 'waking', 'moment', 'tormenting', 'hell', 'fear', 'gathering', 'dread', 'waiting', 'breathless', 'anticipation', 'other', 'shoe', 'drop', ""n't"", 'other', 'woman', 'more', 'burden', 'clinging', 'wife', 'Chris', 'can', 'finally', 'launch', 'action', 'turnabout', 'screenplay', 'might', 'strike', 'many', 'audience', 'arbitrary', 'implausible', 'certainly', 'case', 'be', 'made', 'can', 'go', 'flow', 'will', 'be', 'delighted', 'little', 'ironies', 'Allen', 'final', 'stages', 'story', 'help', 'underline', 'filmmaker', 'thesis', 'efforts', 'make', 'control', 'lives', 'Fickle', 'Finger', 'Fate', 'case', 'tennis', 'ball', 'precariously', 'balancing', 'top', 'net', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'way', 'fall', 'always', 'final', 'word.Allen', 'written', 'dialogue', 'incisive', 'intelligent', 'literate', 'performances', 'drawn', 'likes', 'Rhys-Meyers', 'Goode', 'Emily', 'Mortimer', 'Scarlett', 'Johannson', 'Penelope', 'Wilton', 'are', 'superb', 'tiniest', 'detail', 'Allen', 'camera', 'tightly', 'focused', 'characters', 'rarely', 'pulling', 'away', 'much', 'middle', 'distance', 'keeping', 'firmly', 'locked', 'near-claustrophobic', 'drama', 'Here', 'movie', 'patience', 'beginning', 'really', 'sneaks', 'up', 'longer', 'watch', 'it.Guided', 'hands', 'master', 'Match', 'Point', 'one', 'Allen', 'finest', 'films', 'years']",Match Point

He followed that film with some silly fun films (Bullets Over Broadway, Manhattan Murder Mystery, MIghty Aphrodite) and some strange ones (Husbands and Wives, Shadows and Fog), among others, mostly I suppose to dilute the bad taste it left in his mouth.  I mean, what was he REALLY saying?  That murder is OK as long as you can get away with it?  Come on, we know that couldn't sit well with the Wood Man.  So he went and made a bunch of movies to cleanse his exposed immoral soul!!!  Or something psychoish like that.With Matchpoint, it seems that Allen has decided to take a deep breath and delve back into the dark side.  In Crimes and Misdemeanors, Martin Landau plays a now-privileged opthamologist who has embarked on an affair that can destroy his successful life.  After playing some moral games in his head, he digs deep and decides to put a hit on his lover, played sadly by the incomparable Angelica Huston.  Somehow, he gets away with it. (Or does he? as Woody Allen's character asks in the last scene of the 1989 film).  Well, now it's 2005 or 2006, whatever, it's now.  And so we now have a mentally not tough tennis pro played by Jonathan Myers who takes on the Landau role.  Instead of Angelica Huston, now Allen gives us the biggest gun of all, the incomparably gorgeous Scarlett Johansson.  Oh God.... What to do?  Do you keep the privileged life you have always dreamed of?  Or do you throw it all away and relegate yourself to a penniless existence, all so you can make endless love with Scarlett Johansson?

977723,A2PNTEDGMOLMOY,B000EQHXNW,Scott Schiefelbein,"[3, 3]","Woody Allen's ""Match Point"" is impossible to relate to - unless you were born with a $20 million trust fund.  Allen's movie explores the England of tennis clubs, massive country estates, posh London townhouses, opera, and the appearance of ""work.""  Maybe some readers out there know what it's like to have Daddy basically buy you a gorgeous husband, but I doubt that it's many.In other respects, ""Match Point"" explores what is a near-universal human experience - pondering what I will do to protect the life I have built.  That Allen may explore this idea in a rather unconventional way just makes it all the more entertaining.Jonathan Rhys Meyers plays Chris, a poor Irish lad who has abandoned the competitive life of the pro tennis circuit to teach tennis at one of London's most elite clubs.  Allegedly self-reliance and ""wanting to make a contribution,"" Chris is also the kind of guy who reads ""Crime and Punishment"" with the Cambridge Companion by his side to help him through the tough parts.  Chris really doesn't want to do his own heavy lifting.This is proven when he gets invited to the opera by one of his students, Tom Hewett (Matthew Goode).  Tom is the scion of one of England's wealthiest families, heading by business tycoon Alec (Brian Cox).  Tom's sister, Chloe (Emily Mortimer), is attractive, intelligent, and spoiled rotten.  As an aside, it is amazing what a little make-up and costume work can do, 'cause Chloe is a bit frumpy, while the dazzling Ms. Mortimer can also be radiant - see her brief role as ""Perfect Girl"" in ""Notting Hill.""  But I digress.Chloe wants Chris.  Badly.  So Daddy buys Chris.  Sure, Chris protests about paying his own way and all that, but soon Chris is living in an amazing flat Alec purchased for him and Chloe, spending nights at the opera in the family box, being driven by the company car to a job given to him by Alec, and shopping at those London stores where you need a personal financial statement just to get int the door.  Chris is the epitome of the kept man - Chloe even says what is necessary for him to keep his dignity as they both know it is being washed away.Allen injects a wicked dagger into this tranquil scene in the form of Nola (the superbly-sultry Scarlett Johansson).  Nola is engaged to Tom, but Chris can't keep his eyes or hands off of her.  But Tom's family does not really approve of the American Nola, who is only a struggling actress.The plot seemingly boils down to whether Chris will act on his lust for Nola, thereby putting his perfect life of ease at risk.  Because it's Scarlett, every man in the audience is tempted along with Chris.  But fortunately for the audience, Allen has some dastardly twists and turns in store, and what seems to be a conventional set-up develops swiftly into a dark and sordid tale.""Match Point"" opens with Chris reading the line, ""I'd rather be lucky than good.""  When a main character says that, you know the story will either turn on his good luck or his bad luck.  It is to Allen's credit that the audience will go back and forth - like a tennis match - on whether Chris's luck will hold or break.  Ultimately, only at match point will the answer be revealed.While hardly an amazing movie, ""Match Point"" is a lot of dark fun.

The clue is a few specific words during dialogue in the penultimate scene with Jonathan Rhys Meyers (as Chris Wilton) where he discusses what has happened (or ponders it--a particularly eerie part of the film).  I'm inclined to see the story as more than a morality tale because of that clue.  As others have noted, one of the most intriguing things about this movie is the presence of hints throughout, so it would not surprise me to find out that the plot is a comment on particular real contemporary events. Judge for yourself (I won't say what I think it is about).Beyond that, there is no question the film is very good. It makes the viewer uncomfortable on several levels, one indication of its worth as art. There was only a moment when I was not absolutely glued to the script. At one point Jonathan Rhys Meyers, whose acting is top-notch here, delivers a line that brought a chuckle that was certainly not intended. My wife and I both noticed it at the same time. He utters an urgent appeal that is word-for-word from the mouth of his character Cassander in the film Alexander, and worse, his enuciation is precisely the same as well. It jolted me out of this film and into a scene in Alexander--I've never had that happen except maybe when watching old John Wayne movies.

977726,AJ9W09EUQPAKE,B000EQHXNW,Sirin,"[0, 2]","Match Point is an extremely slick, taught and accomplished thriller. Chris Wilton, played with superb restraint by Jonathan Rhys Myers, is a former tennis pro who realises he could never make it in the Henman league so is resigned to teaching the game at an exclusive West London tennis club. He is a lonely, cultured soul, listening to opera and reading Dostoyevsky in his studio flat. Luck, the key theme of the movie, then plays its first part. Chris finds himself tutoring Tom Hewett, a wealthy aristocrat who shares a love of opera. Tom invites Christ to Covent Garden, wherupon Chloe, Tom's sister, takes a shine to him. Tom, entranced by the world of aristocratic priviledge the Hewett's inhabit begins a relationship with the sweet, good girl Chloe, yet at the same time finds himself obsessed with Nola Rice (Scarlett Johansson), Tom's American, struggling actress fiancee.Both Chris and Nola share similarities in that they are outsiders, trying to break into the Hewett's traditionalist, English upper class world view (and Allen, the Jewish New Yorker, portrays this world with superb accuracy, right down to the fine nuances of the class system - such as the food you order, and conversational patterns at the dinner table). Chris plays his cards right - dating Chloe, marrying her, and finding a lucrative job in his father in law's company, with opportunity for career development. Nola, on the other hand, is alienated by Eleanor Hewitt's snobbish distain for her acting ambitions. Chris, taking advantage of her uncertainty, her vulnerability, begins a passionate affair with Nola while he is married to Chloe. Nola is dumped by Tom, who marries another woman, more suited to his well bred family mating strategy, and leaves the country.She returns to Britain and bumps into Chris while he is visiting the Tate Modern with his wife - another instance of luck, and Chris rekindles the affair, with greater lust and passion. Predictably, he becomes torn between the two women in his life - the sweet, good natured, and well bred Chloe (Emily Mortimer - who plays a difficult and important role very skilfully) who is desperate for a baby and also holds the key to the wealthy privileges Chris enjoys from the Hewetts, and the tempestuous actress Nola whom he loves with great passion but knows he can have no stable future with. How to resolve this? the path Chris resolves on, in the spirit of Dostoyevsky (note that in a key scene at the start of the novel he reads Crime and Punishment with an accompanying guide to the novel) is a Russian denoument full of dark nights of the soul, existentialist torment and deep issues of morality. The plot twists at the end are cleverly worked out, I won't reveal the tantalising conclusion, but be assured that the image at the start of the movie of a tennis ball slapping into the net chord and hovering tantalisingly in the air, the viewer uncertain which side of the net it will fall on, is a key image reprised later in the film.And more generally, how does Match Point, a rare departure from his native side of the Atlantic, compare with the rest of Allen's work. I agree with the general consensus that Match Point represents a late period renaussance for Allen, continuing the good work from Melinda and Melinda. It is clever, well written and slickly plotted. The acting is generally first rate. One thing missing for me though: the laughs. Allen must have gone to herculean efforts to supress his natural bountiful intelligent wit in order to set a comedy amongst the modern British Upper classes who these days are not so much eccentric non-conformists as simply very very boring, having to work long hours in boring city jobs as the only way of viably maintaining their Belgravia houses and country estates. This film reflects this well, since not one of the characters has so much of a trace as a sense of humour. It is an excercise in massive self restraint on the part of all the actors. The only one who lets off steam is Scarlett Johansson when she becomes hysterical as Chris prevaricates about leaving his wife. Come on Woody - you seem to know the British Upper classes so well: even the stiffest of upper lips has to wobble sometimes and give way to a giggle every now and then, otherwise they would be driven completely nuts - which is what actually happens to the protagonist in this movie!

What we have here is a skillful blend of equal parts Dreiser's AN AMERICAN TRAGEDY, Dostoevsky's CRIME AND PUNISHMENT, and original Woody Allen.  Amid a backdrop of strikingly original and fresh London locales, Chris keeps having sexual encounters with Chloe (whose smoking in the film's first half is a major irritation for me), while his loving wife suspects nothing.  Why anyone married to this likeable and loving Chloe would want to have an affair with the coarse and unpleasant Nola is part of MATCH POINT's ironic complexity.  Seemingly, Allen does not want the affairs to make sense.When Nola gets pregnant, refuses an abortion after two failed marriages, and demands that Chris leave his wife, the film's second half really kicks into gear.  Woody ventures into the darkest and most chilling material he has ever created.  MATCH POINT becomes ironic and enthralling.  This is Woody Allen's longest film at 124 minutes, but one of his very finest.  It is flawless and dead serious adult filmmaking.  One wishes he would stay abroad for a while and make more films that do not feature him in them!The only fault is not a film flaw at all, but rather the lack of bonuses on a DVD retailing for a steep $30 (I paid $20 at Target; Amazon has it for even less).  But from what I have read about Woody Allen and what he thinks about his movies and which are the best and worst, he is his own executioner.  We are probably better off interpreting this film and other Allen ones as we choose.  Still, I would like the filmmaker to let me know if I am on the right track in hating Nola and embracing Chloe in this movie.  Critics I've read can't even agree that Chris and Chloe are married to one another!  Then why would Nola ask Chris to divorce Chloe when Nola gets pregnant?  It all makes for great coffee house or bedroom conversation after seeing this magnificent movie in a theater or on home video.",5,Woody Allen in dark and chilling territory,1145923200,"04 25, 2006",2006,2574,"['Woody', 'Allen', 'heads', 'London', 'powerful', 'disturbing', 'brilliantly', 'acted', 'MATCH', 'POINT', 'was', 'Oscar', 'nominee', 'Original', 'Screenplay', 'have', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'six', 'billed', 'alphabetically', 'always', 'Allen', 'Brian', 'Cox', 'Matthew', 'Goode', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'Emily', 'Mortimer', 'Jonathan', 'Rhys-Meyers', 'Penelope', 'Wilton', 'Woody', 'not', 'appear', 'even', 'narrate', 'voice-over.Rhys-Meyers', 'anti-hero', 'Chris', 'former', 'tennis', 'pro', 'now', 'instructor', 'working', 'class', 'cad', 'who', 'around', 'brother-in-law', 'sluttish', 'American', 'fiancee', 'Nola', 'Johansson', 'even', 'marrying', 'wealth', 'beautiful', 'elegant', 'British', 'Chloe', 'Mortimer', 'What', 'have', 'here', 'skillful', 'blend', 'equal', 'parts', 'Dreiser', 'AN', 'AMERICAN', 'TRAGEDY', 'Dostoevsky', 'CRIME', 'PUNISHMENT', 'original', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'Amid', 'backdrop', 'strikingly', 'original', 'fresh', 'London', 'locales', 'Chris', 'having', 'sexual', 'encounters', 'Chloe', 'smoking', 'film', 'first', 'half', 'major', 'irritation', 'loving', 'wife', 'nothing', 'Why', 'anyone', 'married', 'likeable', 'loving', 'Chloe', 'would', 'want', 'have', 'affair', 'coarse', 'unpleasant', 'Nola', 'part', 'MATCH', 'POINT', 'ironic', 'complexity', 'Seemingly', 'Allen', 'not', 'want', 'affairs', 'make', 'sense.When', 'Nola', 'pregnant', 'abortion', 'two', 'failed', 'marriages', 'Chris', 'leave', 'wife', 'film', 'second', 'half', 'really', 'gear', 'Woody', 'ventures', 'darkest', 'most', 'chilling', 'material', 'ever', 'created', 'MATCH', 'POINT', 'ironic', 'enthralling', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'longest', 'film', '124', 'minutes', 'one', 'very', 'finest', 'flawless', 'dead', 'serious', 'adult', 'filmmaking', 'One', 'would', 'stay', 'abroad', 'while', 'make', 'more', 'films', 'do', 'not', 'feature', 'only', 'fault', 'not', 'film', 'flaw', 'rather', 'lack', 'bonuses', 'DVD', 'retailing', 'steep', '30', 'paid', '20', 'Target', 'Amazon', 'even', 'less', 'what', 'have', 'read', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'what', 'movies', 'are', 'best', 'worst', 'own', 'executioner', 'are', 'probably', 'better', 'off', 'interpreting', 'film', 'other', 'Allen', 'ones', 'choose', 'Still', 'would', 'like', 'filmmaker', 'let', 'know', 'am', 'right', 'track', 'hating', 'Nola', 'embracing', 'Chloe', 'movie', 'Critics', ""'ve"", 'read', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'agree', 'Chris', 'Chloe', 'are', 'married', 'one', 'Then', 'why', 'would', 'Nola', 'ask', 'Chris', 'divorce', 'Chloe', 'when', 'Nola', 'pregnant', 'great', 'coffee', 'house', 'bedroom', 'conversation', 'seeing', 'magnificent', 'movie', 'theater', 'home', 'video']",Match Point

This is a story about a humble tennis pro and aspired American actress played by Scarlet Johansen.  They both try to climb up social ladder by connecting wealthy people and possibly marry into their family.  This movie offers you great writing and smart plot.  Woody Allen uses tennis as metaphor.  In the moment of the tennis match, ball hit the top of the net and it may end up either side of the court to decide the winner.  This metaphor was adapted wisely at the end of the movie.  The movie wisely portraits human natures, desires, behaviors, passions, and it was developed into love/drama/black comedy/thriller masterpiece.

For one, he usually writes a part for himself, which nobody but him could play.  That's the type of Woody Allen movie I like and feels natural.  Match Point on the contrary just felt empty.  This isn't to say Woody has lost his touch.  I very much enjoyed Scoop, in which Scarlett Johansson stars with him in.Like I said before, I knew this would not be a typical Woody movie, but I wonder if it had been directed by anyone else would I have liked it any better or worse.  The whole movie is basically about an affair.  I wish I could ellaborate on that, but that really is pretty much the whole plot, spelled out for you.Jonathan Rhys Meyers does an OK job and Scarlett is pretty much what you expect.  They have an affair, but then what?  Scene after scene of her demanding to know when he's going to leave his wife for her like he keeps promising he will.  His real wife suspects he's having an affair because he's always on the phone with her and he denys it.  It felt like there wasn't enough written to fill a whole movie so Woody just repeated the same scenes over and over until it becomes tedious beyond belief.I can't ruin the ending for you.  I wish I could to save you 2 uneventful hours of your time, but let's just say nothing changes.

There, he meets Tom Hewett (Matthew Goode), the son of a rich businessman and they strike up a friendship. Tom learns of Chris' love for opera and offers him an extra ticket for the next show allowing Chris to meet the entire Hewett family; sister Chloe (Emily Mortimer, ""Dear Frankie""), ""Poppa"" Alec (Brian Cox) and mother (Penelope Wilton, ""Pride and Prejudice""). Chloe and Chris plan a date and soon become inseparable leading her to ask Poppa to find a position for Chris in one of his companies. Alec wholeheartedly agrees and Chris is soon the head of a division, spending weekends at the Hewett country estate and shagging Chloe on his sleeper sofa. Then, Chris meets Nola (Scarlet Johannson), Tom's American fianc&eacute;e. They flirt and begin an affair. Chris and Chloe are soon married and move into a fantastic loft on the South Bank. But as Chris becomes more and more comfortable in his life with Chloe, and her father's money, his relationship with Nola spins out of control, threatening his newfound security.This is just a small portion of the plot for the new film ""Match Point"". I remember clearly the first time I saw the trailer and the reaction when it was revealed as a Woody Allen film. There were a couple of audible ""whoa""s in the audience. Everything in the trailer was different from anything we had ever seen in an Allen film before; hints of a torrid love affair, the predominantly British cast and setting, the dramatic overtones with little evidence of comedy, hints at possible violence. In short, it surprised everyone. It surprised me. After almost a decade of slogging through mediocre films like ""Small Time Crooks"" and truly bad, bad films like ""Curse of the Jade Scorpion"", ""Melinda and Melinda"" (shudder!), and ""Anything Else"" (double shudder!!), my patience as a die hard Woody Allen fan was sorely tested. The trailer peaked my curiosity. Is it possible? Could he have made another great film? Something so different from his previous works to respark his career?""Match Point"" is a very good film, easily Allen's best in a decade. But it falls short of his classics, films like ""Annie Hall"", ""Hannah and Her Sisters"" and ""Crimes and Misdemeanors"" for a few reasons.One of the biggest surprises is that Allen would set a film anywhere other than his beloved New York. But the London setting works well for Allen's writing and directing style. His writing is a little unnatural at times; a large majority of the characters in his films speak as though they all attended an Ivy League college and consistently stand around talking about philosophy, opera and `making love'. I'm not saying this doesn't happen, but in his less successful films, it rings false. In his last great films, this worked because the people who spoke these lines were wealthy, educated and it was believable. He also balanced these storylines with the comedic antics of his character.Another positive change Allen has begun to make is that he is casting other actors as leads in his films. Will Farrell, Kenneth Branagh, John Cusack and others have essentially played the ""Woody Allen"" role in some of his recent offerings. This is a step in the right direction, but in most of these cases, these younger actors are still speaking Allen's dialogue and it just doesn't work. Strangely, in ""Point"", there is no ""Woody Allen"" character, adding another level of surprise to the film. He has created something almost entirely new, challenging his skills and abilities.The predominantly British cast and locations add a level of authenticity to his writing, helping it seem more natural. We fully believe that a bunch of upper crust Brits would act and speak like this. At one point, late in the film, a character quickly talks about neuroses, reminding us that this is in fact a Woody Allen film. But before and after this point, the thought never occurred to me. You might almost forget.The biggest and best change in the new film is that Allen doesn't subject us to another interpretation of his character running around with an actress (or two) twenty to thirty years his junior. We are spared endless scenes of these actresses claiming what a great lover Allen's character is. Thank GOD! Allen is a funny guy, but to watch Elizabeth Berkeley, Helen Hunt and others fight over Allen, and his ""ability to make love"", is just painful.In ""Point"", Allen casts Jonathan Rhys Meyers and Scarlet Johannson as the ill-fated lovers. Emily Mortimer completes the trio as Chris' supportive, yet eager to be pregnant wife. As the film begins, we realize we are in the hands of an accomplished filmmaker. Through a series of short scenes, Chris' life is quickly established and Rhys Meyers hints that his character may be a gold-digger, placing himself in situations in which he is more likely to meet the well-to-do. Then again, he could just be trying to make his life better; he is constantly trying to learn and seems to work hard. But Chris remains enough of an enigma to keep us guessing. As his life begins to get better, it also starts to unravel. He quickly becomes comfortable in his new lifestyle and sees it slipping out of his hands if Nola gets her way.Emily Mortimer brings a quiet vulnerability to the role of Chloe. She adds just the right level of love and support to spoiled rich girl, making her character interesting and believable. Just as things begin to get complicated, she begins nagging Chris about having a baby. This causes her husband to vacillate back and forth. Should he stay with Chloe or leave her for a more passionate, but less comfortable existence with Nola?The biggest problem in the film is Scarlet Johannson. She is good, but Allen's dialogue does not blend well with her age, lack of experience and accent. In her mouth, his dialogue sounds stiff and forced. The contrast between Johannson and the British actors is really quite noticeable. She is much better in her scenes with Tom, as his fianc&eacute;e, sharing alcohol and food, flirting a bit, putting on an act. When she becomes the center of Chris' attention, she does and says things which seem unnatural becoming a fairly stereotypical ""jilted lover"". How exactly does a young American woman come up with the resources to move from England to the States and then back to London again? How does she survive in London on a shop girl's salary?Also, there is a point during the resolution when characters, specifically two British detectives, talk about things we haven't seen. Their descriptions are amusing, but it is a sloppy method of storytelling.These two points aside, ""Match Point"" represents a return to form for a master filmmaker. As the story unfolds, and we realize the events will be told in a series of tableaus, leaving out the unnecessary bits, we realize we are in the hands of a master. Sit back, enjoy and let Allen tell his story.",4,Woody Allen - Back in Form...,1137715200,"01 20, 2006",2006,6975,"['Chris', 'Wilton', 'Jonathan', 'Rhys', 'Meyers', 'former', 'tennis', 'pro', 'job',

977737,A2GJ98824GGXGP,B000EQHXNW,Timothy Kearney,"[46, 57]","MATCH POINT is considered by some to be a departure for Woody Allen, due largely to its setting and its few oddities that can sometimes be an annoying Allen trademark. Yet it is also a well acted and well developed film that would be reminiscent for some of films such as ANNIE HALL. In order to know for sure, a person has to see it to decide and it's certainly worth seeing.The film tells the story of Chris Wilton, and Irish born tennis player who realizes there's only so far his game will take him, so he takes a job as a tennis pro hoping to make a connection with London's upper class. His charm and ability ensure this will happen. He meets a client Tom Hewett, the son of a powerful business leader. Wilton marries Tom's sister, endears himself to his in-laws, and has a passionate affair with Nola, Tom's fianc&eacute; then later ex-girlfriend. Much of the film focuses on the ways in which Wilton goes to great lengths to cover up his affair.The actors fit their roles well. Chris Wilton is played masterfully by Irish born Jonathan Rhys Meyers. Rhys Meyers has the look of someone who would fit into British upper class circles, and he comes across less as an imposter and more as a climber. Rhys Meyers, who is familiar to many who saw the film BEND IT LIKE BECKHAM, again an Irish lad trying to make it in England, albeit in very different circles, demonstrates he's a believable and versatile actor. Scarlet Johansson plays the American actress Nola, likewise gives a phenomenal performance. The Hewett Family: Brian Cox as father Alec, Penelope Wilton as mother Eleanor, Mathew Goode as Tom and Emily Mortimer as Chris' wife Chloe seem like British aristocrats, oblivious to all that is happening round them, yet believable too. Perhaps one of the films strengths is the fact that the Hewetts are oblivious to Chris' scheming and climbing, and that Chris is not a character whose controlled by ambition as much as his desire not to loose the good life he's created for himself.My guess is that since MATCH POINT was nominated for several Golden Globe Awards and will likely be nominated for Academy Awards too, people will take notice of this film. One of our local newspapers praised MATCH POINT because it was a Woody Allen film that was not typical Allen fare. Another paper praised it because it is so Woody Allen, but set in London rather than New York. The long and the short of it is, chances are you'll enjoy this film whether you like Woody Allen or not.",5,An Engrossing and Engaging Film,1137628800,"01 19, 2006",2006,2479,"['MATCH', 'POINT', 'considered', 'be', 'departure', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'due', 'largely', 'setting', 'few', 'oddities', 'can', 'sometimes', 'be', 'annoying', 'Allen', 'trademark', 'also', 'well', 'acted', 'well', 'developed', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'reminiscent', 'films', 'such', 'ANNIE', 'HALL', 'order', 'know', 'sure', 'person', 'see', 'decide', 'certainly', 'worth', 'seeing.The', 'film', 'story', 'Chris', 'Wilton', 'Irish', 'born', 'tennis', 'player', 'who', 'only', 'so', 'far', 'game', 'will', 'take', 'so', 'job', 'tennis', 'pro', 'hoping', 'make', 'connection', 'London', 'upper', 'class', 'charm', 'ability', 'ensure', 'will', 'happen', 'client', 'Tom', 'Hewett', 'son', 'powerful', 'business', 'leader', 'Wilton', 'Tom', 'sister', 'in-laws', 'passionate', 'affair', 'Nola', 'Tom', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'then', 'later', 'ex-girlfriend', 'Much', 'film', 'ways', 'Wilton', 'great', 'lengths', 'cover', 'up', 'affair.The', 'actors', 'fit', 'roles', 'well', 'Chris', 'Wilton', 'played', 'masterfully', 'Irish', 'born', 'Jonathan', 'Rhys', 'Meyers', 'Rhys', 'Meyers', 'look', 'someone', 'who', 'would', 'fit', 'British', 'upper', 'class', 'circles', 'across', 'less', 'imposter', 'more', 'climber', 'Rhys', 'Meyers', 'who', 'familiar', 'many', 'who', 'saw', 'film', 'BEND', 'IT', 'LIKE', 'BECKHAM', 'again', 'Irish', 'lad', 'trying', 'make', 'England', 'albeit', 'very', 'different', 'circles', 'believable', 'versatile', 'actor', 'Scarlet', 'Johansson', 'American', 'actress', 'Nola', 'likewise', 'phenomenal', 'performance', 'Hewett', 'Family', 'Brian', 'Cox', 'father', 'Alec', 'Penelope', 'Wilton', 'mother', 'Eleanor', 'Mathew', 'Goode', 'Tom', 'Emily', 'Mortimer', 'Chris', 'wife', 'Chloe', 'seem', 'British', 'aristocrats', 'oblivious', 'happening', 'round', 'yet', 'believable', 'too', 'Perhaps', 'one', 'films', 'strengths', 'fact', 'Hewetts', 'are', 'oblivious', 'Chris', 'scheming', 'climbing', 'Chris', 'not', 'character', 'controlled', 'ambition', 'as', 'much', 'desire', 'not', 'loose', 'good', 'life', 'created', 'himself.My', 'guess', 'MATCH', 'POINT', 'was', 'nominated', 'several', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'Awards', 'will', 'likely', 'be', 'nominated', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'too', 'people', 'will', 'take', 'notice', 'film', 'One', 'local', 'newspapers', 'praised', 'MATCH', 'POINT', 'was', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'film', 'was', 'not', 'typical', 'Allen', 'fare', 'paper', 'praised', 'so', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'set', 'London', 'rather', 'New', 'York', 'long', 'short', 'chances', 'are', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'film', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'not']",Match Point

977741,A220FJEQNGMSRN,B000EQHXNW,Trevor Willsmer,"[1, 1]","Match Point may offer a change of locale and style for Woody Allen but it does nothing to redress the continuing decline of his work. It's not bad, more flat, partially because of some awkward dialogue (Allen really doesn't have an ear for the British dialects, going either for Dick Van Dyke or Medieval King-speak) and some uninspiring lead performances. Social climbing tennis pro Jonathan Rhys Myers, the poor man's Jude Law, says all his lines correctly and with almost perfect diction without ever convincing there's anything but an actor who'll never fulfil his early promise underneath, but it's Scarlet Johannson who is the film's most surprising casualty as a struggling actress. Faced with such awkwardly on the nose dialogue and such a stock character, she visibly flounders for much of the first half of the film as if cast adrift by a director afraid of interfering with the actors by ever directing them no matter how apparent it is that they need help. Supporting players are mostly left to do their best with one-note parts to varying degrees of success (Matthew Goode, Ewan Bremner Alexander Armstrong), laziness (Brian Cox, Paul Kaye) and embarrassment (James Nesbitt and a startlingly inept Colin Salmon). The second half does improve, though there's the definite feeling that Allen is dodging the issue in the potentially promising but unintentionally laughable closing scenes, and some of the dialogue is painfully amateur. With its shades of A Kiss Before Dying via the Martin Landau plot strand of Crimes and Misdemeanors but without the interesting bits, this never really feels quite like a proper movie.

977742,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B000EQHXNW,Tsuyoshi,"[2, 4]","Woody Allen finally left New York City, perhaps for good, and comes back with this `serious' work. `Match Point' stars Jonathan Rhys Meyers as Chris Wilton, a former pro tennis player and social climber, whose life reminds you of the novels of Patricia Highsmith. In fact, you can call him Talented Mr. Ripley, but Allen re-uses and gives sly twists to the familiar rules of thrillers and melodramas so cleverly that Chris's story becomes a study of our life in general seen from a delightfully cynical point of view.I don't have much to say about the plot itself. The fast-paced story about ambitious Chris is set in London, where he meets two girls: Chloe (Emily Mortimer), good-natured girl and daughter of a rich president of some big company, and Nora (Scarlett Johansson), American girl who wants to be an actress. So which choice will Chris take?[CLEVER MELODRAMA] The answer is, of course, ""Both."" `Match Point' is about infidelity or ambition, but at the same time it is about chance, or luck, and the role it plays in our life. Allen intentionally employs various kind of clich&eacute; seen in noirs or thrillers to emphasize this point, which is ultimately summarized with the neat conclusion at the last five minutes of the film. It is not as surprising as some people say - we have seen a much cleverer one in `Plein soleil' (1960) based on, yes, Patricia Highsimth - but it is still well-calculated.Frankly I don't agree with Allen's view on life, but its cynicism is certainly fascinating. Allen's London is, quite understandably, that of outsiders, seen from the viewpoint of a tourist, and the film's postcard beauty, people living there might say, does not really represent the city. Still we should know that this is not about the real London or its high society; it is about the imaginary place hovering between reality and fiction.The film also has some shrewd references to opera, painting, and literature. An American in England is a familiar theme in novels, and one Dostoevsky novel plays a significant role in the plot twist. But you don't have to know these things at all; it is a thriller in Woody Allen style. There are no quirkily funny dialogues, but still `Match Point' is a compelling drama with one or two interesting commentaries about life.",4,Woody Allen's Comeback: He Does a Patricia Highsmith-ish Thriller and It's Not Bad,1160006400,"10 5, 2006",2006,2276,"['Woody', 'Allen', 'finally', 'left', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'perhaps', 'good', 'back', 'serious', 'work', 'Match', 'Point', 'stars', 'Jonathan', 'Rhys', 'Meyers', 'Chris', 'Wilton', 'former', 'pro', 'tennis', 'player', 'social', 'climber', 'life', 'novels', 'Patricia', 'Highsmith', 'fact', 'can', 'call', 'Talented', 'Mr.', 'Ripley', 'Allen', 're-uses', 'sly', 'twists', 'familiar', 'rules', 'thrillers', 'melodramas', 'so', 'cleverly', 'Chris', 'story', 'study', 'life', 'general', 'seen', 'delightfully', 'cynical', 'point', 'view.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'say', 'plot', 'fast-paced', 'story', 'ambitious', 'Chris', 'set', 'London', 'where', 'two', 'girls', 'Chloe', 'Emily', 'Mortimer', 'good-natured', 'girl', 'daughter', 'rich', 'president', 'big', 'company', 'Nora', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'American', 'girl', 'who', 'be', 'actress', 'choice', 'will', 'Chris', 'take', '[', 'CLEVER', 'MELODRAMA', ']', 'answer', 'course', 'Match', 'Point', 'infidelity', 'ambition', 'same', 'time', 'chance', 'luck', 'role', 'life', 'Allen', 'intentionally', 'various', 'kind', 'clich', 'eacute', 'seen', 'noirs', 'thrillers', 'emphasize', 'point', 'ultimately', 'summarized', 'neat', 'conclusion', 'last', 'five', 'minutes', 'film', 'not', 'as', 'surprising', 'people', 'say', 'have', 'seen', 'much', 'cleverer', 'one', 'Plein', 'soleil', '1960', 'based', 'yes', 'Patricia', 'Highsimth', 'still', 'well-calculated.Frankly', 'do', ""n't"", 'agree', 'Allen', 'view', 'life', 'cynicism', 'certainly', 'fascinating', 'Allen', 'London', 'quite', 'understandably', 'outsiders', 'seen', 'viewpoint', 'tourist', 'film', 'postcard', 'beauty', 'people', 'living', 'there', 'might', 'say', 'not', 'really', 'represent', 'city', 'Still', 'should', 'know', 'not', 'real', 'London', 'high', 'society', 'imaginary', 'place', 'hovering', 'reality', 'fiction.The', 'film', 'also', 'shrewd', 'references', 'opera', 'painting', 'literature', 'American', 'England', 'familiar', 'theme', 'novels', 'one', 'Dostoevsky', 'novel', 'significant', 'role', 'plot', 'twist', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'know', 'things', 'thriller', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'style', 'are', 'quirkily', 'funny', 'dialogues', 'still', 'Match', 'Point', 'compelling', 'drama', 'one', 'two', 'interesting', 'commentaries', 'life']",Match Point

These characters simply don't have enough water under their bridges or connections of responsibility to make their moral decisions significant enough for us, the viewers. It ends up no more than a story you might read about in the newspaper, and then turn the page. The dialogue is mundane, uninteresting, unrevealing.  Woody Allen yearns so much to be Chekov that he strays from his own genius. This is a completely serious movie that remains flat throughout, despite a surprising turn.  And that turn tells us that there actually is no presence of love in this plot at all--which indicates that the demon in this story is only from the shallowest levels of hell--a devil of straw--just evil chaff in the wind. Instead, for a very strong, punch-in-the-gut movie about infidelity, I would suggest Mike Nichols' ""Closer""--a strong conflict with morally challenged characters whose dialogue is far from mundane, heavily energetic and engaging, and without the affected Chekov. Lots of coincidental similarities in the two movies too--same settings, similar characters, and even Jude Law looks and speaks a lot like Jonathan Myers (check out the similarities in the DVD cover illustrations). But in ""Closer,"" Law's character's inner conflicts are much more externalized, giving us a sense of the whys and wherefores of his actions. Myers character simply doesn't flesh out.

977744,A96K1ZGW56S2I,B000EQHXNW,"tvtv3 ""tvtv3""","[0, 0]","I don't think there has been a modern filmmaker who has examined romantic love and relationships as in depth as Woody Allen. Allen has been a prolific filmmaker who often writes, directs, produces, and acts in his own pictures. Out of the Allen canon, 90% of the films revolve around romantic love. However, despite the many awards and the adoration of critics and the love of many New Yorkers, Allen has never been a popular filmmaker. His films tend to fall on the high end of art and are usually ignored (many times undeservedly so) by the general public. That was until Allen left New York and the U.S. and decided to try to make a film entirely overseas in the mother country of England. When he did that, he made a small little picture entitled MATCH POINT that not only is a quirky modern murder mystery that examines the difference between lust and love, but also became his first film in nearly two-decades to make a huge profit.MATCH POINT stars Jonathan Rhys Meyers as Chris Wilton, a former tennis pro seeking to start a new life. Even though Chris can play tennis really well, he never was much of a contender. However, he hasn't lost much talent and has a lot of skills and talks his way into being hired as an instructor at a posh London club. While working there he befriends the wealthy Tom Hewett (Matthew Goode). Tom invites Chris to the family estate where he meets Tom's sister, Chloe (Emily Mortimer). Chris finds Chloe somewhat attractive, but sees in her more as a means of attaining social stature and wealth. While at the estate Chris is also introduced to Tom's American girlfriend, Nola (Scarlett Johansson). Chris is smitten with Nola and she is attracted to him as well, but it is with Chloe that Chris begins a relationship. She's the key to his future.Chris treats Chloe well and her parents begin to accept him into their family. However, the Hewetts shun Nola. She's an American and an actress, two things that the wealthy old family just can't seem to abide with. Chloe's father soon offers Chris a job with the family company and Chris' social star is on the rise. Although he treats Chloe affectionately, it is with Nola that Chris seeks his true pleasure. The two begin a heated, passionate affair. They become consumed by their lust for each other. Yet, just as Chris is using Chloe, Nola is using Chris to further her own interests. However, Nola doesn't really suspect that Chris is playing her, too. It is a conflict between love and lust, between ambition and simple goal-setting, and between good and evil.The film never glorifies Chris' bad behavior. Of course, it doesn't make excuses for the bad choices that the other characters make, either. Instead, the film displays what happens when people allow themselves to be controlled by their unbridled passions. It's a modern morality tale that we can all learn from. Having been written and directed by Woody Allen makes MATCH POINT even more interesting. This is a must see film for fans of Woody Allen and Scarlett Johansson. It's also a great film to watch if you're in the mood for a serious, intriguing drama with a strong, moral message.",4,Love Vs.

All those movie critics can't be wrong, right? Well, they were. Remove Woody's name from the credits, and all you have is an ordinary love triangle with a murder tacked on near the end.If you know ""Crime and Punishment,"" ""An American Tragedy"" or Hitchcock's ""Strangers on a Train"" as well as the Scott Peterson case, you know what I mean. It's a tired old plot - social climber has affair with poor girl, gets her pregnant and decides to murder her in order to be with a wealthy woman.Yawn. Still, Woody has made a film that's watchable. He was smart to film in Britain. Woody is so out of touch with real American life (few minorities; lots of fancy apartments with rich people) that the stuffy British upper class life suits him.However, his constant, irritating use of scratchy old records for a soundtrack and his inability to write dialogue for REAL people in their 20s and 30s makes it clear that Woody is trapped in the past.

That is the plot that Woody Allen crafts in Match Point.  In typical Allen fashion, the young man happens to be married and the object of his lust was the fiancee of his wife's brother.  We see once again Allen's interest in human relations.  Only this time comedy, satire, and neurotic compulsiveness are not at the forefront; murder is.  I felt that Allen didn't fully explore the depth of character needed to keep this viewer emotionally engaged. Scarlett Johansson is beautiful, but her role as the seductress turned stalker is uneven.  Allen did not get enough from her and I believe she still has much more to give. Jonathan Meyers in the lead is good, but he is no Ray Milland (Dial M for Murder) or Michael Douglass ( Fatal Attraction). The film lacks suspenseful editing and it never really reaches a climatic pitch.  The exterior shots of London and the use of tennis, highbrow English nobilty, and opera add to the film's plot, but not enough to save it from its first gear pace. I did like the twist that concluded the movie though.

When she returns to London Chris reignites their passion, which can only lead to tragedy. And only luck can save him.""Match Point"" is the antithesis of the modern 'blockbuster' and all it's moronic trappings -- there's no quick editting, no CGI, no goofy one-liners, no explosions and no promise of $400 million at the box office. No, ""Match Point"" is movie-making based simply on good writing and cinematic storytelling. The first hour plays out like a slow, nigh tedious drama but the second builds momentum like a snowball slowly morphing into an avalanche. So, be forewarned, if you don't have the stomach for an hour of soap operatics avoid this movie. For those who do, however, ""Match Point"" is quite rewarding, unpredictable and original.Underpinning the drama is the theme of luck. The film starts out with a tennis ball hitting the top of the net; at that point the ball will fall on one side of the net or the other, depending solely on the luck of the player (or so the movie claims). At first, this seems totally unrelated to the story, but wait till the end and you'll see everything connect. It's amazing how good writing & storytelling can create a 'Wow' reaction much more so than the most elaborate overkill action sequence with all its requisite cgi and explosions.I sensed a somewhat sad emptiness in the characters; most of them are neither likable nor unlikable (although Chloe is super-sweet albeit naive), they're just human beings trying to find meaning and fulfillment, despite their physical riches or lack thereof. Their innate moral compass has been lost with the passing of religious faith and they desperately search for meaning in the secular world of Dostoevsky, Sophocles, the visual arts and Verdi's operas. Only the mother and main protagonist, Chris, come off unappealing; the mother is just annoyingly snobbish, whereas Chris is so blatantly selfish and flat (not to mention unfaithful) I find it hard to believe any of the characters in the story would find him appealing, let alone worthy of marrying into the family and becoming a prominent part of the business.What's ironic is I strangely found myself rooting for Chris in the final act, which doesn't make sense since I'm completely opposed to his (lack of) character and what he does (I can't say more because I don't want to spoil the film). Or maybe I temporarily rooted for him because, regardless of the outcome, I realize no one ultimately ""gets away"" with anything in life -- lucky or not.The love, I mean lust, scenes between Chris and Nola struck me as ultra-steamy and authentic. This is exactly how a man and woman in illicit passion would secretly go at it. Case in point: the 'rain scene' is potent. Needless to say, ""Match Point"" is a must for Scarlett Johansson fans.As to the ""Fatal Attraction"" reference: No, you don't have to worry about psycho slasher cliches.
