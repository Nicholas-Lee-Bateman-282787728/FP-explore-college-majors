Most other offerings don't come near it with the depth and breadth of its scope.Clearly someone has done the folklore research that goes into the mostly European origins of the Fairytales that form the basis of the show's premise. The stories provided each week are engaging and full of enough character development that makes them quite a bit more than the usual one or two dimensional stereotypes for a fantasy/horror show. The viewer has the opportunity to care about what happens to a whole ensemble of characters that continue in an ongoing story full of mystery and suspense.

Trying to return the discs to the package is painful, as the plastic does not hold its form at all, and the disc tends to just crumple the plastic up at the back of the cardboard sleeve, which causes me to have to shove my fingers into the cardboard to retrieve the plastic, and the glue holding the cardboard into a sleeve eventually fails.

Interesting also: the episodes titles are partially references to movie/serie titles.I had been curious and must say GRIMM is a interesting, thrilling fantasy show which use parts of fairy tales of Grimm. ""Grimm"" is a human ""Wesen"" who can see more than normal people and who's hunting beasts, monsters etc. The detective Nick is a GRIMM and after his Aunt was attacked by a monster he's beginning to lern new things - out there are many more things.

1446402,A3QC4SG7NA4ULG,B0058YPKIA,A reader,"[2, 4]","How do I love this campy fairy-tale/cop hybrid? Let me count the ways:First, great writing. Don't you hate it when you know what's coming next? Predictability is a death knell for me when it comes to TV. But GRIMM surprises me every time. Rarely is TV truly scary, but I've actually gasped and jumped out of my chair on numerous occasions watching this show. Each episode is remarkably, tightly written, with many more twists and turns than your average network endeavor. Then there's the humor. The writers wisely knew GRIMM would be a hard sell if we had to take it completely seriously. So, in between the on-going dramatic story lines we are treated to quirky personalities like Monroe the Pilates practicing, 'cello playing, vegetarian wolf, and Sgt. Wu, who eats carpets and couch foam after inadvertently stepping into someone else's evil spell. What could have been a really bad, really dumb TV show becomes, in the hands of these great writers, an ever-fascinating, unique exploration of things that go bump in the night.Second, great details. What a hoot that the writers take their source material directly from the original Grimm fairytales. But they go further, providing us with a lot of highly technical background information, right down to creating volumes of ancient texts with pictures and diagrams, potions, weapons, ritual, culture, customs, you name it. The development of an underworld of supernatural creatures who live among us is brilliant in its depth. Who knew there were snakes, beavers, birds, lions, tigers and bears living right next door? It definitely explains the behavior of some of my noisier neighbors...Third, great cast. David Giuntoli, as Nick, is a babe, plain and simple. Beautiful to look at, he's the centerpiece of the action, and he holds up his end of things very well. His partner, Russell Hornsby, is more than just a sidekick. He's a hottie in his own right who participates almost equally in the action, although I'd like to see him have a bigger role. (I understand this will be the case in Season 2.)  Bitsie Tulloch as Nick's wise, fearless veterinarian girlfriend and Sasha Roiz as the sinister police captain do great work with their well-conceived characters. Reggie Lee as Sgt. Wu provides terrific comic relief. But the star of the show has to be Simon Weir Mitchell as the Blutbad (wolf), struggling to keep his baser impulses under control in the service of a compassionate hippie's heart. What a wonderfully written character, and so beautifully played. Truly an Emmy-worthy performance. Monroe the Big Bad Wolf joins my pantheon of great, more-or-other-than-human characters like Doctor Who, and Mr. Spock and Data from Star Trek.Lastly, I'd mention the casting and plot surprise in the final episode of Season 1, but it involves an important plot twist that I don't want to spoil, so just keep your eyes open and see who (and what) turns up.My only complaint with GRIMM, and it's obviously not enough to keep me from watching, is that the violence is WAY too graphic. We really don't need to see a shredded torso, bleeding eyeballs or chopped-off ear up close and personal, do we?  There's one episode in particular in which a woman is force-fed like a goose, that is absolutely horrific. It goes beyond the bounds of decency for anything on television. I get it that this is a vicious underworld we're dealing with, but my sensibilities are not well-served by the degree of gore - literally buckets of blood and guts - that I'm forced to view each week. I usually have to shut my eyes at some point in every episode. Yeah, I know it's fake, but it's still too much. I may be old-fashioned in this regard, but I won't apologize for it.Still, all things considered, GRIMM is one of the most unlikely, and best, shows I've seen on network television in a long time. I rate it up there with the new Battlestar Galactica, the best of Star Trek, Doctor Who and Forever Knight in the sci-fi/fantasy genre. I hope it has a long run because I want to see what happens next!",5,Gory but Great,1342310400,"07 15, 2012",2012,4030,"['How', 'do', 'love', 'campy', 'fairy-tale/cop', 'hybrid', 'Let', 'count', 'ways', 'First', 'great', 'writing', 'Do', ""n't"", 'hate', 'when', 'know', 'what', 'coming', 'next', 'Predictability', 'death', 'knell', 'when', 'TV', 'GRIMM', 'time', 'Rarely', 'TV', 'truly', 'scary', ""'ve"", 'actually', 'gasped', 'jumped', 'chair', 'numerous', 'occasions', 'watching', 'show', 'episode', 'remarkably', 'tightly', 'written', 'many', 'more', 'twists', 'turns', 'average', 'network', 'endeavor', 'Then', 'humor', 'writers', 'wisely', 'knew', 'GRIMM', 'would', 'be', 'hard', 'sell', 'had', 'take', 'completely', 'seriously', 'So', 'on-going', 'dramatic', 'story', 'lines', 'are', 'treated', 'quirky', 'personalities', 'Monroe', 'Pilates', 'practicing', 'playing', 'vegetarian', 'wolf', 'Sgt', 'Wu', 'who', 'carpets', 'couch', 'foam', 'inadvertently', 'stepping', 'someone', 'else', 'evil', 'spell', 'What', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'really', 'bad', 'really', 'dumb', 'TV', 'show', 'hands', 'great', 'writers', 'ever-fascinating', 'unique', 'exploration', 'things', 'go', 'bump', 'night.Second', 'great', 'details', 'What', 'hoot', 'writers', 'take', 'source', 'material', 'directly', 'original', 'Grimm', 'fairytales', 'go', 'further', 'providing', 'lot', 'highly', 'technical', 'background', 'information', 'right', 'down', 'creating', 'volumes', 'ancient', 'texts', 'pictures', 'diagrams', 'potions', 'weapons', 'ritual', 'culture', 'customs', 'name', 'development', 'underworld', 'supernatural', 'creatures', 'who', 'live', 'brilliant', 'depth', 'Who', 'knew', 'were', 'snakes', 'beavers', 'birds', 'lions', 'tigers', 'bears', 'living', 'right', 'next', 'door', 'definitely', 'behavior', 'noisier', 'neighbors', 'Third', 'great', 'cast', 'David', 'Giuntoli', 'Nick', 'babe', 'plain', 'simple', 'Beautiful', 'look', 'centerpiece', 'action', 'end', 'things', 'very', 'well', 'partner', 'Russell', 'Hornsby', 'more', 'just', 'sidekick', 'hottie', 'own', 'right', 'who', 'almost', 'equally', 'action', ""'d"", 'like', 'see', 'have', 'bigger', 'role', 'understand', 'will', 'be', 'case', 'Season', '2', 'Bitsie', 'Tulloch', 'Nick', 'wise', 'fearless', 'veterinarian', 'girlfriend', 'Sasha', 'Roiz', 'sinister', 'police', 'captain', 'do', 'great', 'work', 'well-conceived', 'characters', 'Reggie', 'Lee', 'Sgt', 'Wu', 'terrific', 'comic', 'relief', 'star', 'show', 'be', 'Simon', 'Weir', 'Mitchell', 'Blutbad', 'wolf', 'struggling', 'keep', 'baser', 'impulses', 'control', 'service', 'compassionate', 'hippie', 'heart', 'What', 'wonderfully', 'written', 'character', 'so', 'beautifully', 'played', 'Truly', 'Emmy-worthy', 'performance', 'Monroe', 'Big', 'Bad', 'Wolf', 'pantheon', 'great', 'more-or-other-than-human', 'characters', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'Mr.', 'Spock', 'Data', 'Star', 'Trek.Lastly', ""'d"", 'mention', 'casting', 'plot', 'surprise', 'final', 'episode', 'Season', '1', 'important', 'plot', 'twist', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'spoil', 'so', 'just', 'keep', 'eyes', 'open', 'see', 'who', 'what', 'up.My', 'only', 'complaint', 'GRIMM', 'obviously', 'not', 'enough', 'keep', 'watching', 'violence', 'WAY', 'too', 'graphic', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'see', 'shredded', 'torso', 'bleeding', 'eyeballs', 'chopped-off', 'ear', 'up', 'close', 'personal', 'do', 'one', 'episode', 'particular', 'woman', 'force-fed', 'goose', 'absolutely', 'horrific', 'bounds', 'decency', 'anything', 'television', 'get', 'vicious', 'underworld', ""'re"", 'dealing', 'sensibilities', 'are', 'not', 'well-served', 'degree', 'gore', 'literally', 'buckets', 'blood', 'guts', ""'m"", 'forced', 'view', 'week', 'usually', 'have', 'shut', 'eyes', 'point', 'episode', 'Yeah', 'know', 'fake', 'still', 'too', 'much', 'may', 'be', 'old-fashioned', 'regard', 'wo', ""n't"", 'apologize', 'it.Still', 'things', 'considered', 'GRIMM', 'one', 'most', 'unlikely', 'best', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'network', 'television', 'long', 'time', 'rate', 'there', 'new', 'Battlestar', 'Galactica', 'best', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'Forever', 'Knight', 'sci-fi/fantasy', 'genre', 'hope', 'long', 'run', 'want', 'see', 'what', 'next']",Grimm

More common, are the many pagan sects which hold to the same nonsense.  Of course, the idea that humans are able to be beasts as well, is as old as time.So whoever invented the Grimm series, plays to all those ideas.  So each canned episode, always ending happily, always predictable, threads a longer take-over-the-world plot by such shapeshifters, by Episode 18 (?) of Season 1.  Yawn.Acting is good, film editing and cinematography, special effects, are all good.  When they speak French or German, excellent.  But the canned nature of each episode is 'this week's new shapeshifter' who is involved with, a victim of, or the perpetrator of a crime.  Sigh.

More and more viewers are taking to fantasy, it would seem.Grimm has a similar plot structure to Smallville.  Meaning that the show's plots revolve around a ""villain of the week"" routine.  While I really enjoy the show for now, I just wonder how long it will take for other viewers to get tired of it.  These villains themselves are not your typical human criminals.  I guess that is the novelty.  This is basically a cop show, with a twist.  The twist being that in the world of the show, you have species like half-humans walking around.  Normally, these folks look to us just like ordinary humans.  But to those who can ""see"" their animal side, the difference is as clear as day.  Those humans who have this gift are called ""Grimms"".  And the main character, a police detective, is a grimm.Production values and special effects are both good quality.  Acting quality is pretty good.  David Giuntoli, Silas Weir Mitchell, Bitsie Tulloch, Reggie Lee, Russell Horn, and Sasha Roiz are the regulars.  This is a good show.

I find the writing top-notch, the characters engaging, and the production values above par for television. I highly recommend the show as one of the best on TV right now. That being said: When the DVD first came out, it seemed to me horribly expensive; so I waited until I could get a good price on it (figured it would be during the holidays, and I was right). When I finally got the DVD today and opened it, my first reaction was ""Oh, no, not paper packaging again!"" I hate DVD's and CD's that are packaged in paper. They are unwieldy, and the disks too easy to scratch while getting them out of and back into their paper sleeves. This set was worse than that. The glue they used didn't hold; so many of the sleeves were open top to bottom. The disks all slid down, and disk 1 (which for some reason had switched sleeves with disk 5) had glue all over it. Fortunately, I have a glue-dissolving solution that doesn't damage the disk. I have immediately switched the disks into a plastic DVD case that holds 6 disks, but now I have to figure out how to store it along with the paper packaging that has all the disk info on it. Such an inconvenience, and it shows disrespect for the customer, especially when Universal's list price is as high as they made it. Terrible, horrible, deplorable, and cheap. ""Green"" packaging is the worst thing to ever happen to the entertainment industry. If season 2 comes similarly packaged, I will be quite reluctant to buy it. Wish I could give separate star rating for the show and for the package. If I could, it would be 5 stars for the show, 1 star for the package (and that star is just for the program guide).

1446578,A2TXR85WQLE32N,B0058YPKIA,D. S. Thurlow,"[3, 4]","What do you get when you cross a police procedural with a collection of fairy tales?  You get ""Grimm"", set in dark, rainy, mysterious Portland and populated with creatures ripped from children's storybooks.  Detective Nick Burkhardt (David Giuntoli) learns in the first episode that he is a Grimm, a descendant of a long line of special hunters, charged with keeping the peace between the human and monster communities.  Nick suddenly acquires the ability to see the monsters as they are, not as the normal humans they pretend to be.  Nick is assisted by Monroe (a marvellously deadpan Silas Weir Mitchell), who is a reformed big bad wolf in his alternative configuration.  Nick's detective partner Hank Griffin (Roger Hornsby) is unaware of Nick's new talents, but will be driven half-mad by season's end by things he can't explain.  Nick's steadfast girlfriend Juliette (Bitsie Tulloch) will also become aware that Nick is leading a double life.Episodes typically featured a crime of the week, which invariably turned out to have one or more monsters involved.  Nick would apply his special skills to try to solve the case without giving away the presence of monsters in Portland to his co-workers.  Later in the season, the shows became more complicated, introducing elements of a larger conspiracy that somehow involved the fate of Nick and his friends.  Fortunately, Nick's skills in combatting the monsters improved steadily; one of the better episodes has him confronting two skilled and vicious monster assassins inside the powerhouse of an old dam, in an excellent sequence featuring special weapons and martial arts skills.Enjoying the show does require the viewer to buy into the premise.  The show itself took a little while to settle into its own storyline; this reviewer thought the episodes got better over time.  A season-ending cliffhanger left Nick with serious complications in his relationships with his partner and his girlfriend.  ""Grimm"" was renewed for a second season, which will give the producers a chance to explore the larger monster alternative universe they only hinted at in season one; highly recommended.",4,This is Different...,1337990400,"05 26, 2012",2012,2138,"['What', 'do', 'get', 'when', 'cross', 'police', 'procedural', 'collection', 'fairy', 'tales', 'get', 'Grimm', 'set', 'dark', 'rainy', 'mysterious', 'Portland', 'populated', 'creatures', 'ripped', 'children', 'storybooks', 'Detective', 'Nick', 'Burkhardt', 'David', 'Giuntoli', 'first', 'episode', 'Grimm', 'descendant', 'long', 'line', 'special', 'hunters', 'charged', 'keeping', 'peace', 'human', 'monster', 'communities', 'Nick', 'suddenly', 'ability', 'see', 'monsters', 'are', 'not', 'normal', 'humans', 'pretend', 'be', 'Nick', 'assisted', 'Monroe', 'marvellously', 'deadpan', 'Silas', 'Weir', 'Mitchell', 'who', 'reformed', 'big', 'bad', 'wolf', 'alternative', 'configuration', 'Nick', 'detective', 'partner', 'Hank', 'Griffin', 'Roger', 'Hornsby', 'unaware', 'Nick', 'new', 'talents', 'will', 'be', 'driven', 'half-mad', 'season', 'end', 'things', 'ca', ""n't"", 'explain', 'Nick', 'steadfast', 'girlfriend', 'Juliette', 'Bitsie', 'Tulloch', 'will', 'also', 'become', 'aware', 'Nick', 'leading', 'double', 'life.Episodes', 'typically', 'featured', 'crime', 'week', 'invariably', 'turned', 'out', 'have', 'one', 'more', 'monsters', 'involved', 'Nick', 'would', 'apply', 'special', 'skills', 'try', 'solve', 'case', 'giving', 'away', 'presence', 'monsters', 'Portland', 'co-workers', 'Later', 'season', 'shows', 'became', 'more', 'complicated', 'introducing', 'elements', 'larger', 'conspiracy', 'somehow', 'involved', 'fate', 'Nick', 'friends', 'Fortunately', 'Nick', 'skills', 'combatting', 'monsters', 'improved', 'steadily', 'one', 'better', 'episodes', 'confronting', 'two', 'skilled', 'vicious', 'monster', 'assassins', 'powerhouse', 'old', 'dam', 'excellent', 'sequence', 'featuring', 'special', 'weapons', 'martial', 'arts', 'skills.Enjoying', 'show', 'require', 'viewer', 'buy', 'premise', 'show', 'took', 'little', 'while', 'settle', 'own', 'storyline', 'reviewer', 'thought', 'episodes', 'got', 'better', 'time', 'season-ending', 'cliffhanger', 'left', 'Nick', 'serious', 'complications', 'relationships', 'partner', 'girlfriend', 'Grimm', 'was', 'renewed', 'second', 'season', 'will', 'give', 'producers', 'chance', 'explore', 'larger', 'monster', 'alternative', 'universe', 'only', 'hinted', 'season', 'one', 'highly', 'recommended']",Grimm

Not only was another modern-fairy-tale series being produced at the same time, but it was going to be a police procedural.But to my surprise, ""Grimm Season 1"" ended up being a very solid urban fantasy show, with plenty of dark humor, mystery and some very creepy supernatural creatures. It could use a little more arc in its storylines, but it successfully meld police detective work with the stories of the Brothers Grimm. These are not children's fairy tales.Detective Nick Burkhardt (David Giuntoli) suspects that he's going crazy when he keeps seeing strange things. But when his aunt pays a visit, she reveals that he is a Grimm -- part of an ancient line of guardians who are able to see the supernatural ""wesen"" (pronounced ""vessen""). When she dies, she leaves Nick a trailer full of weapons, ancient books and potions.With the help of the reluctant Monroe (Silas Weir Mitchell), a Wieder Blutbad (""big bad wolf""), Nick begins investigating crimes that are committed by wesen... while also having to keep his identity secret from his partner Hank (Russell Hornsby) and beloved girlfriend Juliette (Bitsie Tulloch).Even as he investigates bizarre crimes that only he can deal with, Nick also discovers that a sultry Hexenbiest -- a wicked witch, in other words -- is bespelling his partner. And he begins to investigate the deaths of his parents, which may not have been an accident... and which were connected to whatever is going on.""Grimm Season 1"" has a pretty simple premise -- that all the strange creatures of the Grimm tales were real, and that they live secretly amongst us. Fortunately the writers keep a dark, violent edge to the season, keeping the whole idea of beaver-people and a lupine ""Rapunzel"" from seeming ridiculous. Their ""Cinderella"" story is downright TERRIFYING.If the series has a problem, it's that its story arcs could be a little stronger. But the ones it has are pretty good, with Nick learning about his destiny and growing into it, even as Captain Renard is scheming to... do something. And the writers do an excellent job of making the wesen ""real"" people, like Monroe's intense love of Christmas, or the Eisbiebers (who are ""average working-class joes"" wesen).The cast is also really good. Giuntoli looks like a genuine police detective, albeit with a boyish, inquisitive edge, and he plays off the scruffy, good-hearted Mitchell really well. Mitchell's Monroe is a real delight -- a reclusive vegetarian ""big bad wolf"" who initially is reluctant to help Nick, but ends up his loyal, trusted partner. And the cast is rounded out nicely by Tulloch, the mysterious Sasha Roiz, the jovial Reggie Lee, and Monoe's love interest Bree Turner.""Grimm Season 1"" starts off a little slow, but after a few episodes it really kicks into the dark, gruesome fairy-tale stride.

A detective finds out that he has supernatural powers and sees mythical creatures hiding in human form. He ends up having to solve murder mysteries and crimes, which inevitably involve some supernatural being.While I enjoyed Ghost Whisperer a lot, I'm not as fond of this show. The characters in Grimm are pretty functional. Each character does what he or she has to do given their roles, but they don't really shine. Nick, the main detective, is a bit bland. I'd have a tough time really saying I like any of the characters, except for the laid back werewolf Monroe.Also, the plots of most episodes are fairly straightforward - murder, find murderer, fight murderer. Some episodes do this better than others but it's still very formulaic.

He's a detective with the Portland PD and he suddenly finds out that that he's a grimm and can see supernatural creatures (Wesen) most of whom are ruthless murderers who, when they surge (transform into Wesen), possess incredible strength and speed.  And it seems that just about every other person in Portland is one of these creatures.  At first I thought that housing values must really be low if that's the kind of people they have in Portland because no normal person would dare to live there but then we have Congress so people must be used to frightening creatures.  I digress . . .  The problem for Burkhardt is that he doesn't feel he can tell anyone about what he's seeing and in addition, Burkhardt must start from scratch to learn how to deal with these creatures..The structure of this series is quite good for keeping viewers interested.  There is a multilayer story structure that keeps people interested and looking forward to the next installment of the series.  At the bottom level is plot for the week's show and then there's the storylines that span series installments such as the hidden identity/agenda of Captain Sean Renard (Sasha Roiz), Burkhardt superior, Burkhardt's developing relationship with Monroe (Silas Weir Mitchell), a reformed Blutbad and Monroe's developing love with Rosalee Calvert (Bree Turner), herself a wesen and reformed drug addict.  And there's Burkhardt's complicated relationship with Juliet Silverton (Bitsie Tulloch) who Burkhardt loves and wants to protect though this proves impossible to do.  She is aware early on that there's something strange going on but not until the end of the 1st season is she able to compel Burkhardt to 'fess up.  Finally, in the last installment of the first year, Burkhardt comes face to face with his mother who is supposed to be dead.Of course it's necessary to somewhat suspend rational thought to enjoy this series because otherwise the series would be, at best, ridiculous.  Consider that Burkhardt is supposed to be able to see wesen, Why then does Captain Renard remain hidden from him?  As of the last of the 1st year, Burkhardt has no clue that Renard is a wesen.  And what about the wesen that are arrested and taken into custody?  Do they never surge when in jail?  Er . . . Burkhardt, there's this teensy little thing you left out of your report . . .Of course none of this really detracts from the series at all and I've already purchased the second season.",4,Consistently Interesting and exciting,1370822400,"06 10, 2013",2013,2666,"['do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'really', 'could', 'add', 'plethora', 'reviews', 'series', 'least', 'can', 'add', 'own', 'cheers', 'chorus.Rick', 'Burkhardt', 'David', 'Giuntoli', 'detective', 'caught', 'serious', 'bind', 'detective', 'Portland', 'PD', 'suddenly', 'out', 'grimm', 'can', 'see', 'supernatural', 'creatures', 'Wesen', 'most', 'whom', 'are', 'ruthless', 'murderers', 'who', 'when', 'surge', 'transform', 'Wesen', 'possess', 'incredible', 'strength', 'speed', 'just', 'other', 'person', 'Portland', 'one', 'creatures', 'first', 'thought', 'housing', 'values', 'must', 'really', 'be', 'low', 'kind', 'people', 'have', 'Portland', 'normal', 'person', 'would', 'dare', 'live', 'there', 'then', 'have', 'Congress', 'people', 'must', 'be', 'used', 'frightening', 'creatures', 'digress', 'problem', 'Burkhardt', ""n't"", 'feel', 'can', 'tell', 'anyone', 'what', 'seeing', 'addition', 'Burkhardt', 'must', 'start', 'scratch', 'learn', 'how', 'deal', 'creatures..The', 'structure', 'series', 'quite', 'good', 'keeping', 'viewers', 'interested', 'multilayer', 'story', 'structure', 'people', 'interested', 'looking', 'forward', 'next', 'installment', 'series', 'bottom', 'level', 'plot', 'week', 'show', 'then', 'storylines', 'span', 'series', 'installments', 'such', 'hidden', 'identity/agenda', 'Captain', 'Sean', 'Renard', 'Sasha', 'Roiz', 'Burkhardt', 'superior', 'Burkhardt', 'developing', 'relationship', 'Monroe', 'Silas', 'Weir', 'Mitchell', 'reformed', 'Blutbad', 'Monroe', 'developing', 'love', 'Rosalee', 'Calvert', 'Bree', 'Turner', 'wesen', 'reformed', 'drug', 'addict', 'Burkhardt', 'complicated', 'relationship', 'Juliet', 'Silverton', 'Bitsie', 'Tulloch', 'who', 'Burkhardt', 'loves', 'protect', 'impossible', 'do', 'aware', 'early', 'something', 'strange', 'going', 'not', 'end', '1st', 'season', 'able', 'compel', 'Burkhardt', ""'fess"", 'up', 'Finally', 'last', 'installment', 'first', 'year', 'Burkhardt', 'face', 'face', 'mother', 'who', 'supposed', 'be', 'dead.Of', 'course', 'necessary', 'somewhat', 'suspend', 'rational', 'thought', 'enjoy', 'series', 'series', 'would', 'be', 'best', 'ridiculous', 'Consider', 'Burkhardt', 'supposed', 'be', 'able', 'see', 'wesen', 'Why', 'then', 'Captain', 'Renard', 'remain', 'hidden', 'last', '1st', 'year', 'Burkhardt', 'clue', 'Renard', 'wesen', 'what', 'wesen', 'are', 'arrested', 'taken', 'custody', 'Do', 'never', 'surge', 'when', 'jail', 'Er', 'Burkhardt', 'teensy', 'little', 'thing', 'left', 'out', 'report', '.Of', 'course', 'none', 'really', 'series', ""'ve"", 'already', 'purchased', 'second', 'season']",Grimm

Grimms fight supernatural evil forces. There is no shortage of evil forces.He also must try to appear normal around his girlfriend, Juliette Silverton (Bitsie Tulloch) and his homicide partner Hank Griffin (Russell Hornsby).One of the more interesting characters is Monroe (Silas Weir Mitchell) a Wider Blutbad who aids Nick with his cases.This is where it gets wierd. A Blutbaden (Bloot-baad-in) are werewolf like. Monroe is a reformed Blutbad who has sworn off ""humans"" for food, and developed an intense regimen of diet, drugs, and exercise.The worst of the worst are the Reapers. They appear like our Halloween notion of the Grim Reaper, usually dressed in long black trench coats and carrying a large scythe.The blessing or curse that Nick carries, as a Grimm, is he can see all of these odd creatures for what they are, even though they've become part of society, kind of like Invasion of The Body Snatchers.

But Grimm is much more firmly situated in the real world of American metropolitan cops and robbers.  The lead character is just discovering his specialness and his police partner and his fiancee are normal human beings who aren't aware of what is really taking place.The title is apt because it is grim, as grim as most contemporary police dramas, but its also fun to watch how they connect the crimes into the tales collected by the Brother's Grimm.  Weird, grisly crimes are committed by folk tale characters - so there are plenty of bad guys - but we are also introduced to other fantastical characters who are benign, such as a good natured vegetarian wolfman who really should be getting a regular pay check from the police as his contributions have been crucial to solving many of the mysterious crimes.I'm still watching the first season, and so far I've enjoyed the imaginative premise and I love the setting in the American North West - perfect for the story lines which are set in and around deep dark forests!",4,A police procedural with a fantasy twist,1400457600,"05 19, 2014",2014,1194,"['Having', 'watched', '1st', 'Season', 'Once', 'A', 'Time', 'thought', 'Grimm', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'same', 'given', 'pilot', 'had', 'Little', 'Red', 'Riding', 'Hood', 'Fairy', 'Tale', 'tie-in', 'Grimm', 'much', 'more', 'firmly', 'situated', 'real', 'world', 'American', 'metropolitan', 'cops', 'robbers', 'lead', 'character', 'just', 'discovering', 'specialness', 'police', 'partner', 'fiancee', 'are', 'normal', 'human', 'beings', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'aware', 'what', 'really', 'taking', 'place.The', 'title', 'apt', 'grim', 'as', 'grim', 'most', 'contemporary', 'police', 'dramas', 'also', 'fun', 'watch', 'how', 'connect', 'crimes', 'tales', 'collected', 'Brother', 'Grimm', 'Weird', 'grisly', 'crimes', 'are', 'committed', 'folk', 'tale', 'characters', 'so', 'are', 'plenty', 'bad', 'guys', 'are', 'also', 'introduced', 'other', 'fantastical', 'characters', 'who', 'are', 'benign', 'such', 'good', 'natured', 'vegetarian', 'wolfman', 'who', 'really', 'should', 'be', 'getting', 'regular', 'pay', 'check', 'police', 'contributions', 'have', 'been', 'crucial', 'solving', 'many', 'mysterious', 'crimes.I', ""'m"", 'still', 'watching', 'first', 'season', 'so', 'far', ""'ve"", 'enjoyed', 'imaginative', 'premise', 'love', 'setting', 'American', 'North', 'West', 'perfect', 'story', 'lines', 'are', 'set', 'deep', 'dark', 'forests']",Grimm

Combining elements of a standard police procedural with classic tales of monster mayhem, NBC's ""Grimm"" was a solid, and somewhat surprising, success for NBC in the 2011-12 season. Modernizing and reinterpreting Grimm's Fairy Tales certainly provides plenty of gritty and unpleasant material for Season One's 22 episodes. With takes on stories like Red Riding Hood, Hansel and Gretel, and The Three Bears (among many others), ""Grimm"" makes for a much darker vision than ABC's fairy tale inspired fantasy ""Once Upon A Time."" This is targeting a different vibe and aims for creepiness and chills which, for the most part, hit their mark. While some tales are stronger than others, the show's technical aspects effectively create an overall mood which distinguishes the look and feel of the show. The dark and spooky sets, the make-up and special effects, the props, and the music really help the show stand out.DVD Info:Both Blu-Ray and DVD releases will be 5 disc sets. The initial DVD/Blu-ray release is slated to be in limited edition packaging that will include exclusive ""Grimm"" collector cards. The Blu-ray will be in hi-def with DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1/ Dolby Digital 2.0 audio. Both DVD and Blu-ray release will have subtitle options.DVD Bonus Features:Deleted ScenesGag reelWorld of Grimm Feature: Discusses characters, creatures, and inspirations behind the stories.Making Monsters Features: Make-up and FX team members showcase how they can bring a creature to life.Grimm Guide: Interactive book that lets you get a closer understanding of the different creatures.""Grimm"" tells the tale of a Portland homicide detective (David Giuntoli) who discovers a family legacy that he never expected. In early episodes, his aunt (Kate Burton) appears with quite a secret. She raised him after his parents untimely death and now must pass on the knowledge that he is what is known as a Grimm. Essentially he is a gatekeeper between the human world and the realm of mythological creatures (wesen in Grimm-speak). He has the power to see beneath their veneer as they are hidden among us, and his duty is to serve as a protector and a executioner. Guintoli, however, as he inherits the mantle is not the ruthless Grimm of his ancestry. He is a kinder and gentler Grimm and sets up a more classic struggle of good versus evil as opposed to man versus beast. His closest ally is, in fact, a the equivalent of a werewolf (or Big Bad Wolf, scene-stealing Silas Weir Mitchell plays the Blutbad). As the season progresses, a larger conspiracy seems to be at work behind the scenes. Might this new Grimm be in over his head?While I enjoyed ""Grimm, it still feels like a show finding its way. The entire premise is amusingly faulty, as practically the entire town of Portland is some kind of creature (good or evil). If the Grimm actually did eliminate any non-human presence, it would be absolute genocide leaving only a handful of residents in the Pacific Northwest! Now that's a show I'd pay to see! Each episode revolves around solving a case, just like a standard police procedural. While some are quite well done, many are too easy to predict. I also don't know that the show has developed its cast of characters sufficiently. Aside from Giuntoli and Weir Mitchell, many of the supporting cast remain relatively ill-defined or underutilized (most especially Bitsie Tulloch as Giuntoli's girlfriend). But still, ""Grimm"" provides something a bit out of the ordinary and these episodes kept me entertained. For Season Two, I'd like to see the continuing plot lines get stronger and dig deeper into the back story and mythology.

NBC's Grimm hopes to be able to do the same thing and judging from the pilot, it seems they are off to a good start.The series itself has a great visual presentation, helped in large part by being set in Portland. The fog, the trees, the dampness all make for an intriguingly atmospheric setting. During the day, it feels ominous and eerie. At night, dark and frightening. Contemporary, modern life contrasted with misty fantastical forests. Actually filming on location in Oregon contributes a great deal to the show.If you're looking for royalty and the traditional fairy tale, you might want to check out that other new fairy tale show. Grimm on the other hand evokes a sense of fantasy that could just as well exist in our own everyday world. The crimes ground the series while the creation of this world in which Grimms have been fighting off creatures for a few hundred years gives it that hook that makes it different and fresher than the sea of crime procedurals on television today. And having the series be that grounded actually helps it be that much more magical.Grimm is as much a mystery/crime drama as it is fantasy and supernatural and more of an adventure as well.

That said my complaints about the show are as follows: it's Buffy with a guy, let's just get that out of the way. It is. Deal with it. They don't seem to have a larger plot line planned out. This means that the episodes tend to play out like episodes of CSI. There's a problem to solve, they solve it. All within the approx. 40 minute time frame they have week to week. Maybe the writers are afraid that if they have a plot that actually arches the season like say, any other show that's successful right now, they'll drop the ball. And lastly some of the FX are questionable, at best. Admit it, they are. That said I do enjoy the show. I find the cast members with the exception of the black partner to be compelling and I'm looking forward to the time they will make it more similar to the way Buffy worked out, a team of peers working together to fight evil.

You and I, of course, falsely believe these evil creatures to be mere fairy tales.

The improper use of German (which is my mother language). For example, Munroe translates ""Spinnetod"" as ""death spider"". However, the correct translation for ""death spider"" would be ""Todesspinne"". Other jarring mistakes are ""Blutbad"" and ""Fuchsbau"", which aren't creatures at all: ""Blutbad"" means blood bath and ""Fuchsbau"" is a fox's den. Then there is the use of adjectives as nouns (""unbezahlbar"", ""haesslich"") and the use of nouns as verbs (""Woge"") - to name just the most glaring ones. I wish they had asked a native speaker for advice instead of using BabelFish.2. Nick gets beat up pretty bad in almost every episode but only once sports a black eye (and some minor injuries).3. I can put up with fairly low-quality special effects, but some of the creatures look just plain ridiculous (Dimitri, anybody?!).4. In almost every episode, we suddenly go from broad daylight to pitch-black night, typically towards the end, just in time for the big Nick-creature showdown.5.

1447025,A23DWAS6CMV4N4,B0058YPKIA,Scamander Riker,"[2, 4]","Basically ""Grimm"" comes down to a pretty good genre show in the vein of ""The X-Files"", ""Supernatural"" and ""Eureka"", only to name a few. It's nothing special, the FX could be a whole lot better but it delivers in terms of acting, atmosphere and grizzly scenery. It may be not as fresh and creatively vivid as ""Once Upon A Time"" but it still could be a very good show if it wasn't for creatures' names...It's quite obvious the writers have absolutely no idea about the German language and picked those names for fun's sake instead of giving at least SOME effort to research. Now, don't get me wrong. I don't expect a literarily faithful adaptation of Grimm's fairytales but at least they should have tried to get the very basics right!So Wolves are called ""Blutbad"", with the plural ""Blutbaden""? The real meaning of ""Blutbad"" is ""blood bath"", the plural would be ""Blutbaeder"" and it cannot refer to a person or creature but only to an action...Total bogus...Also ""Fuchsbau"" doesn't refer to creatures either but simply means ""fox-hole"" or ""fox-den""...""Reinigen"" is a verb that's quite the exact opposite of what rats are associated with: it means ""cleaning up""... This one's especially irritating, since there actually is a word called ""Reineken"", which is a folkloristic synonym for ""fox""...Why not calling those rats ""Hamelin"" instead???""Bauerschwein"" is also hilarious...yeah, it translates ""farmerpig"", but it's grammatically off and is very reminiscent of the bad name ""Bauernschwein"", which would roughly translate ""damn farmer"" or worse...""Seelegut"" has nothing to do with sheep but translates ""good soul"", ""Ziegevolk"" translates ""goat people"" etc...The only term that somewhat works is ""Hexenbiest"", but the plural would be ""Hexenbiester""...None of this would actually bother me if the real Brothers Grimm hadn't been dedicated, passionate linguists who took language and vocabulary very, very seriously. They actually created the first German dictionary, trying to research the meaning and origin of every German word. Their collection of fairy tales was only a minor aspect of their life's work.This is why this series comes of rather offensive to me. Yes, I'm German but far from being a nationalist of sorts. Quite the opposite is the case. But this sort of disrespect for some of the greatest German-speaking writers ever hurts. Calling a series ""Grimm"" that actually has no respect for the Grimm's efforts to collect and cultivate not only fairytales but language itself is nothing but a sad joke.

But it's Monroe (the local werewolf) that Nick runs to for help with the paranormal situations. Nick and Monroe (Silas Weir Mitchell) have a great chemistry. And Monroe's smart humor adds a much-needed light-hearted feel to an otherwise dark and suspenseful setting. Bitsie Tulloch plays Nick's girlfriend Juliette who knows nothing (until the end of the season) about Nick's Grimm legacy.This is one of my favorite shows on television. Each episode is a different Grimm fairy tale or myth with a modern day twist is always full of thrills, chills, and fantastic creatures. The mixture of mystery, suspense, horror and humor makes this a must-watch show. ABC's aired its first season of the popular fairy tale series Once Upon a Time this past year as well. And though there are similarities, there is a decidedly different feel to Grimm. There is none of the corniness or fanciful magic of OUaT. This is dark and gritty, with a more realistic, modern twist to the familiar stories. While there is an overlying arc that flows throughout the season, another nice thing about the series is that you don't necessarily have to watch each one in order.  Each episode is a creature-(or fairy tale)-of-the-week with complex characters and exceptional writing.

Our daughter (10) is sensitive, but has navigated the show on parental reassurance (and older brother scorn) that the monsters are not, in fact, real.

It's exciting, scary, and funny with a similar feel to the early years ofBuffy the Vampire Slayer: The Complete Series. If you like Buffy, there's a good chance you'll like Grimm too.Fairy tale detectives aren't new (there'sThe Fairy Tale Detectives (The Sisters Grimm, Book 1) (Bk. 1)for kids and the Fables series of graphic novels for adults, starting withFables Vol. 1: Legends in Exile). What is new, I believe, is that this is the first TV series to take on the darker aspects of fairy tales in a cop show setting. Grimm is not at the level of the Fable series yet,  but it definitely seems like it'll get deeper as it progresses.This particular episode is based on Goldilocks and the Three Bears. I never really liked Goldilocks, so it was fun to see her get what was coming to her.The main drawback I see to the series at this point is a lack of characters. Right now there's the main character, his partner, and a wolfman who's basically there for laughs and, without a doubt, the best part of the show.

Unfortunately, it wasn't free until recently when it came to Amazon Prime. I watched about 15 episodes in 3 days, and then I was bored. It seems that nothing new is happening, and the story is kind of boring. The only question I had in mind was the true identity of chief of police, and that should say something about why I think it is boring. If you are looking for a fun and engaging series, this is not the one.Now, let's compare this series with the newly created Netflix series Hemlock Grove. I saw all episodes of Hemlock Grove in two consequent days, and I couldn't sleep until watching the next episode. Both have mystic creatures, werewolf/vampire kind of stuff, but Hemlock Grove did a better job in creating the characters and setting the atmosphere. I was anxious to know the true identity of ""the mother"" in Hemlock Grove up to the very last minute of season one. Honestly, I am not that anxious to know the identity of chief of police in Grimm. It was a delight watching Hemlock Grove versus Grimm which felt like a chore.Update:I finally managed to finish season one. After episode 15, things got a little bit better, but not by a long shot. They introduced some new characters, and some better guest actors. I don't know why they've waited 15 episodes to finally give the series a speed up, but at least they did. The final verdict is: Grimm is not a marathon friendly series. You get bored if you want to watch it back-to-back.

1447079,A2U1AM4GCM9N8Z,B0058YPKIA,"Susannah ""PieGrrrl""","[4, 8]","I wanted, and expected, to like this series. It's a creation of the former producers of Buffy (a perennial favorite) and the idea on which it's built has potential. However, potential is pretty much all I've seen so far. The clever dialogue that was such a joy on Buffy and Angel is sadly missing here; in fact, much of the writing can only be described as dull. Once you get past the initial rather cute idea, plot is thin on the ground. In each of the episodes, a new creature is introduced, chased down and dealt with. There's a lot of the chasing, by the way, and it strikes me as filler for stories that just don't have much meat to them.A little character development here would go a long way, but I'm not sure any of the actors could deal with it - with the exception of Silas Weir Mitchell who, admittedly, has more to work with in terms of script than the rest. David Giuntoli, as Nick (I keep forgetting the character's name, which might tell you how much impression he's made on me) is a generic nice-looking average guy. He reads his lines, and that's pretty much all he does but, again, the scripts give him little to work with. Generic fiancee played by Bitsie Tulloch makes no impression at all, and police partner Hank (Russell Hornsby) is simply forgettable. Again, it's hard to tell whether these actors have no ability to breathe life into a character or whether the cardboard nature of the characters just won't allow for it. What are these people about? What motivates them, what's odd about them, what are their weaknesses, who are they? I still don't have much of a clue and my motivation to find out is ebbing away.The idea that sold this series (fairytale creatures live among us undetected, and are hunted by their supposed chroniclers, the Grimms) lends itself to a monster of the week treatment, which grows old quickly - particularly so with the lack of character development. The writers have attempted to introduce an ongoing thread having to do with hidden opposition within the police department. So far, it appears to be a creaky plot device, an ongoing attempt at distraction from the thinness of the stories, and I don't hold out a lot of hope that it will become compelling any time soon.All that being said, I'll give the second season a chance. I'm a sucker for fantasy and, since this is the Buffy team (or, at least, part of it) I'm willing to give them a chance to get up to speed. The actors are weak, so I'm not sure there's much likelihood of a turn-around, but they should (at least) get a new crop of writers.",3,It ought to be better than it is,1344816000,"08 13, 2012",2012,2556,"['wanted', 'expected', 'like', 'series', 'creation', 'former', 'producers', 'Buffy', 'perennial', 'favorite', 'idea', 'built', 'potential', 'However', 'potential', 'pretty', 'much', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'so', 'far', 'clever', 'dialogue', 'was', 'joy', 'Buffy', 'Angel', 'sadly', 'missing', 'here', 'fact', 'much', 'writing', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'described', 'dull', 'Once', 'get', 'initial', 'rather', 'cute', 'idea', 'plot', 'thin', 'ground', 'episodes', 'new', 'creature', 'introduced', 'chased', 'down', 'dealt', 'lot', 'chasing', 'way', 'filler', 'stories', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'meat', 'them.A', 'little', 'character', 'development', 'here', 'would', 'go', 'long', 'way', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'actors', 'could', 'deal', 'exception', 'Silas', 'Weir', 'Mitchell', 'who', 'admittedly', 'more', 'work', 'terms', 'script', 'rest', 'David', 'Giuntoli', 'Nick', 'keep', 'forgetting', 'character', 'name', 'might', 'tell', 'how', 'much', 'impression', 'made', 'generic', 'nice-looking', 'average', 'guy', 'lines', 'pretty', 'much', 'again', 'scripts', 'give', 'little', 'work', 'Generic', 'fiancee', 'played', 'Bitsie', 'Tulloch', 'impression', 'police', 'partner', 'Hank', 'Russell', 'Hornsby', 'simply', 'forgettable', 'Again', 'hard', 'tell', 'actors', 'have', 'ability', 'breathe', 'life', 'character', 'cardboard', 'nature', 'characters', 'just', 'wo', ""n't"", 'allow', 'What', 'are', 'people', 'What', 'what', 'odd', 'what', 'are', 'weaknesses', 'who', 'are', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'clue', 'motivation', 'find', 'out', 'ebbing', 'away.The', 'idea', 'sold', 'series', 'fairytale', 'creatures', 'live', 'undetected', 'are', 'hunted', 'supposed', 'chroniclers', 'Grimms', 'monster', 'week', 'treatment', 'old', 'quickly', 'particularly', 'so', 'lack', 'character', 'development', 'writers', 'have', 'attempted', 'introduce', 'ongoing', 'thread', 'having', 'do', 'hidden', 'opposition', 'police', 'department', 'So', 'far', 'be', 'creaky', 'plot', 'device', 'ongoing', 'attempt', 'distraction', 'thinness', 'stories', 'do', ""n't"", 'hold', 'out', 'lot', 'hope', 'will', 'become', 'compelling', 'time', 'soon.All', 'being', 'said', ""'ll"", 'give', 'second', 'season', 'chance', ""'m"", 'sucker', 'fantasy', 'Buffy', 'team', 'least', 'part', ""'m"", 'willing', 'give', 'chance', 'get', 'up', 'speed', 'actors', 'are', 'weak', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'much', 'likelihood', 'turn-around', 'should', 'least', 'get', 'new', 'crop', 'writers']",Grimm

She did a great job packing the product, etc.  The reason I give it 3 stars is because the negative reviews are right; the sleeves are flimsy -- tissue paper quality -- stuck to the box with glue/rubber cement. When the sheet separates from the box, the disks slide around in each section and can slide out of the top or bottom of the package with little effort.  Plus, it's very easy to get glue on the disks. I transferred the disks to jewel/CD cases.  The disks look okay and the ones I've tested work well but I can't attest to how well they all work at this point. One good thing the manufacturer did was print on the inside part of the package a ""Wesen Dictionary"" with the names of some of the characters and other terminology used on the show, along with a brief description of same.  I hope the package quality improves because at $30+ for this product new, shoddy quality is not acceptable.As to the show itself, I love ""Grimm.""  The beavers (Eisbiber) are my favorite characters.  Also, I've long been a fan of Silas Weir Mitchell and Russell Hornsby.  This is the first show where I've seen David Giuntoli; he's excellent as Detective Burkhardt (the Grimm).  In fact, the entire cast is top notch.  The writing is good, the effects fantastic, and the beavers are so sweet, they'd be welcome in my home any time.Highly recommend this show to adults and older children.  I'm not sure some episodes are appropriate for very young children (under 8) because the special effects are very dark at times (e.g., the Hexenbiest -- witch with black eyes, nasty toothy grimace, in need of a comb).  Another example is ""The Thing with Feathers"" -- gross, gross, gross but in an entertaining way. I don't want to spoil it for anyone but there's one scene ... it's so cringe worthy that I leave the room until it's done and I'm someone who has always found slasher films to be more comedic than horrifying.

Maybe a tater that was taken from a circus but the tiger is actually a Chinese dude who stayed in tiger form so he would not get caught. America is so rich with people and cultures I'm surprised that this show resorts to making up stuff like beaver man and does not use any of the ethic groups actually living in Portland.I like the premise of the show, the actors and the characters but I feel they are trapped in a loop.  There were points when I felt the show could have gotten interesting but chose not to like (spoiler) when the blonde witch lady goes to seduce the partner.  If she actually liked the partner then you would get conflict and romance but it did not happen.  Our hero's romance is really boring and would be better if she was bitten by a werewolf or something but the best the show does is giving here amnesia which is so boring. The mom discovers our hero hanging out with two were people and says racist stuff and no one calls her a racist.  The list goes on.More complaints: (spoiler) Our hero's werewolf friend says he ate people but he never asks about that. He just hangs out with a people eater I guess.  His mom may have killed many harmless were creatures but he never asked her about that or about abandoning him.  It's ridiculous. I'm giving the show two stars but it is mostly for the idea and the actors.",2,"Boring, Racist and filled with clich&eacute; after clich&eacute;",1396483200,"04 3, 2014",2014,2193,"['love', 'urban', 'fantasy', 'lot', 'had', 'see', 'What', 'great', 'idea', 'A', 'guy', 'related', 'Grimm', 'brothers', 'sight', 'can', 'see', 'world', 'supernatural', 'fights', 'supernatural', 'crime', 'only', 'problem', 'episode', 'bad', 'clich', 'eacute', 'Lizard', 'men', 'eat', 'rat', 'people', 'A', 'pied', 'piper', 'dude', 'controls', 'kill', 'etc', 'Also', 'everyone', 'white', 'save', 'partner', 'one', 'cop', 'would', 'be', 'fine', 'monsters', 'were', 'not', 'white', 'people', 'show', 'place', 'Portland', 'Oregon', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'lots', 'run', 'ins', 'Native', 'American', 'fey', 'folk', 'monsters', 'not', 'one', 'are', 'run', 'ins', 'Wendigo', 'are', 'white', 'people', 'other', 'supernatural', 'clich', 'eacute', 'creature.I', 'was', 'kinda', 'hoping', 'Norwegian', 'troll', 'Kung', 'Fu', 'school', 'helping', 'gang', 'find', 'murder', 'who', 'just', 'murderer', 'humans', 'Maybe', 'tater', 'was', 'taken', 'circus', 'tiger', 'actually', 'Chinese', 'dude', 'who', 'stayed', 'tiger', 'form', 'would', 'not', 'get', 'caught', 'America', 'so', 'rich', 'people', 'cultures', ""'m"", 'surprised', 'show', 'making', 'up', 'stuff', 'beaver', 'man', 'not', 'use', 'ethic', 'groups', 'actually', 'living', 'Portland.I', 'premise', 'show', 'actors', 'characters', 'feel', 'are', 'trapped', 'loop', 'were', 'points', 'when', 'felt', 'show', 'could', 'have', 'gotten', 'interesting', 'chose', 'not', 'like', 'spoiler', 'when', 'blonde', 'witch', 'lady', 'seduce', 'partner', 'actually', 'liked', 'partner', 'then', 'would', 'get', 'conflict', 'romance', 'did', 'not', 'happen', 'hero', 'romance', 'really', 'boring', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'was', 'bitten', 'werewolf', 'something', 'best', 'show', 'giving', 'here', 'amnesia', 'so', 'boring', 'mom', 'hero', 'hanging', 'out', 'two', 'were', 'people', 'racist', 'stuff', 'one', 'racist', 'list', 'complaints', 'spoiler', 'hero', 'werewolf', 'friend', 'ate', 'people', 'never', 'just', 'out', 'people', 'eater', 'guess', 'mom', 'may', 'have', 'killed', 'many', 'harmless', 'were', 'creatures', 'never', 'asked', 'abandoning', 'ridiculous', ""'m"", 'giving', 'show', 'two', 'stars', 'mostly', 'idea', 'actors']",Grimm

He has grown up unaware of his ability, but discovers it as his aunt, also a Grimm, is dying. Historically, Grimms have been the enemy of the various creatures, hunting them down and killing them. However, Nick is more benevolent, actually befriending several of the creatures who are not violent; but he is quick to capture or kill creatures that threaten human society.

The actors [with the exception of Bitsie Tulloch as Juliette Silverton, whose leaden lines match her deadpan performance] are interesting to watch, the stories are imaginative, and the longer mystery arc is beginning to hook us in.  We just finished Episode 12 of Season 1, though I inadvertently grabbed a few spoilers from Wikipedia and did not pass them onto her.Comparisons to 1-season-too-long-running X Files and rapid-burnout-shining-star Twin Peaks scream to be made, of course.  On those scales, Grimm's mystery arc is a little flat - not bad, but not classic.  Grimm's repartee is pretty good - after a slow start, the dialog between Nick [David Giuntoli] and Hank [Russel Hornsby] is showing the signs of good writing.  The character of Monroe [Silas Weir Mitchell] is a classic - a bit corny and bordering on the picaresque, but a ton of fun to watch, and well delivered.  That character is matched by Sasha Roiz's mysterious Captain Sean Renard, who, to this point, has not gotten as much exposure as he deserves, but plays his part very, very well.The disclosure of an entire bestiary of shape-sifting quasi-human &#34;Wesens&#34; living among us, of course, takes the notion of vampires and werewolves to the next level.  With each newly-discovered &#34;species&#34; exposing its own quirks on show after show, the entire franchise could head into the same monotonous pattern that made House boring to me but beloved by almost everyone else.  Each new type of Wesen is a study in itself, and some - such as the Mouse Guys - are a total crackup.Looking ahead, they've been renewed for a Season 3, so they will not be out looking for work this summer - which is great for them [for the record, I believe in renewals - we all need a few seasons to get into the groove.]  I am sure we will watch all of them.

While both shows have much in common, ""Grimm"" has managed to grow into its premise and find its own identity.Portland detective Nick Burkhardt (David Guintoli)sees monsters and it's not because he's on drugs. Turns out Burkhardt is one of the last of the Grimms who fought and killed monsters that have preyed on humanity for centuries. Burkhardt like all Grimms has the unique ability to see the creatures masquerading beneath their human mask.With the assistance of Monroe (Silas Weir Mitchell)a reformed werewolf (or a big bad wolf in Grimm mythology)to help him understand the strange new world he's been dropped into, Burkhardt discovers that many of the creatures out there are just trying to survive while others have more insidious motives. Unfortunately there are those in Burkhardt's own police department who are undermining his efforts for their own mysterious reasons.The procedural element of the show isn't quite as strong as the hunt for the various creatures but the show improves as the season wears on. I'd like to see better character development for Nick Burkhardt, his partner and fiance.Updated for blu-ray: the transfer looks quite nice with a sharp, colorful transfer. Blacks are rock solid. Audio sounds quite nice with nice use of the entire sound stage and pulls you into the action without distracting.The only thing I DISLIKE is the packaging. Normally how something is packaged doesn't factor into how I rate a set BUT the Blu-ray discs slide in and out of cardboard packaging. The good news is that Blu-ray can stand up better to west and tear and possible scratching compard to DVD but the bad news is that unless you are very careful there is a chance they will be scratched.The special features don't feature any commentary tracks which is disappointing. We get to see five auditions from the actors. We get two worthwhile featurettes focusing on the creatures in Grimm and the make up effects. We also get deleted scenes.""Grimm"" has a much more droll sense of humor than the more tongue-in-cheek humor of ""Supernatural"" and Mitchell in particular is a highlight of the show with his often sarcastic, dry delivery as Monroe. Both shows are entertaining (""Supernatural"" has its extended mythology which ""Grimm"" is only beginning to develop)and ""Grimm"" has continually improved with each successive episode.Although the pilot is solid, the show improves as the season goes on developing its own mythology. The one flaw with the show has to do with the development of Nick Burkhardt, his partner and girlfriend--while the show does develop the characters as the season goes on they are a bit too generic particularly when compared to Monroe and the supporting characters of the show.Recommended.",4,"This isn't your standard fairytale-far from ""grim""",1331424000,"03 11, 2012",2012,2874,"['Blu-ray', 'review', 'When', 'saw', 'pilot', 'episode', 'Grimm', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'something', 'knock', 'Supernatural', 'Complete', 'First', 'Season', 'shows', 'have', 'much', 'common', 'Grimm', 'managed', 'grow', 'premise', 'find', 'own', 'identity.Portland', 'detective', 'Nick', 'Burkhardt', 'David', 'Guintoli', 'monsters', 'not', 'drugs', 'out', 'Burkhardt', 'one', 'last', 'Grimms', 'who', 'fought', 'killed', 'monsters', 'have', 'preyed', 'humanity', 'centuries', 'Burkhardt', 'Grimms', 'unique', 'ability', 'see', 'creatures', 'masquerading', 'human', 'assistance', 'Monroe', 'Silas', 'Weir', 'Mitchell', 'reformed', 'werewolf', 'big', 'bad', 'wolf', 'Grimm', 'mythology', 'help', 'understand', 'strange', 'new', 'world', 'been', 'dropped', 'Burkhardt', 'many', 'creatures', 'are', 'just', 'trying', 'survive', 'others', 'have', 'more', 'insidious', 'motives', 'Unfortunately', 'are', 'Burkhardt', 'own', 'police', 'department', 'who', 'are', 'undermining', 'efforts', 'own', 'mysterious', 'reasons.The', 'procedural', 'element', 'show', ""n't"", 'quite', 'as', 'strong', 'hunt', 'various', 'creatures', 'show', 'season', ""'d"", 'like', 'see', 'better', 'character', 'development', 'Nick', 'Burkhardt', 'partner', 'fiance.Updated', 'blu-ray', 'transfer', 'quite', 'nice', 'sharp', 'colorful', 'transfer', 'Blacks', 'are', 'rock', 'solid', 'Audio', 'quite', 'nice', 'nice', 'use', 'entire', 'sound', 'stage', 'action', 'distracting.The', 'only', 'thing', 'DISLIKE', 'packaging', 'Normally', 'how', 'something', 'packaged', ""n't"", 'factor', 'how', 'rate', 'set', 'BUT', 'Blu-ray', 'discs', 'slide', 'cardboard', 'packaging', 'good', 'news', 'Blu-ray', 'can', 'stand', 'up', 'better', 'west', 'tear', 'possible', 'scratching', 'compard', 'DVD', 'bad', 'news', 'are', 'very', 'careful', 'chance', 'will', 'be', 'scratched.The', 'special', 'features', 'do', ""n't"", 'feature', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'disappointing', 'get', 'see', 'five', 'auditions', 'actors', 'get', 'two', 'worthwhile', 'featurettes', 'focusing', 'creatures', 'Grimm', 'make', 'up', 'effects', 'also', 'get', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'Grimm', 'much', 'more', 'droll', 'sense', 'humor', 'more', 'tongue-in-cheek', 'humor', 'Supernatural', 'Mitchell', 'particular', 'highlight', 'show', 'often', 'sarcastic', 'dry', 'delivery', 'Monroe', 'shows', 'are', 'entertaining', 'Supernatural', 'extended', 'mythology', 'Grimm', 'only', 'beginning', 'develop', 'Grimm', 'continually', 'improved', 'successive', 'pilot', 'solid', 'show', 'season', 'developing', 'own', 'mythology', 'one', 'flaw', 'show', 'do', 'development', 'Nick', 'Burkhardt', 'partner', 'girlfriend', 'show', 'develop', 'characters', 'season', 'are', 'bit', 'too', 'generic', 'particularly', 'when', 'compared', 'Monroe', 'supporting', 'characters', 'show.Recommended']",Grimm

It just sounded like a cheesy attempt at being creative with something that didn't need any additional modification.  Then I decided to give it a fair shot and actually watch it - that's when I realized how wrong I was.Grimm is the story of a detective who discovers he is descended from the Grimms, who were able to see the &#34;Wessen&#34; or &#34;Creatures&#34; who walk amongst us in human guise.  Most of these Wessen are criminal and thus hunting them down seems to go hand in hand with his job in law enforcement (though there are many moments where he is forced to give up one &#34;job&#34; for the other).  What follows is a gradual unfolding of his ancestry, his family's legacy, and just how penetrated our society is by the creatures.This is a show I can recommend to just about anyone - the stories are creative, the acting is superb, and to those of us familiar at all with some of the fairy tales, you will see easter eggs relating back to various stories that the producers left scattered about some of the episodes.
