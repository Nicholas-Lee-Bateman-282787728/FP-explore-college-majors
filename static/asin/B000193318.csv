796820,A1CK5G1VZ7QDRD,B000193318,A. Thurston,"[0, 0]","First off lets get 2 things clear 1) I never saw nor have any desire to see Roger Vadim's original 1956 version of this film that starred Bridget Bardot. While Ms.Bardot was a striking woman in her day I am no fan of her personal quirk's  2) I adore Rebecca De Mornay I think she's in the top ten percent of attractive actresses of the past 40 years.Not a great actress although she's not bad either but she's about as attractive a screen persona as one can ever imagine. With that out of the way here's my take on the 1988 version of Roger Vadim's And God Created Woman. I generally am wary of remakes in general but like I said I was only aware of the original in passing.But this film came out some 32 years later in a more liberated era as opposed to how women in film were portrayed. Plus it was directed by the same person who did it the first time so it's no hack job done for a quick cash in. The story centers around Robin Shea played by De Mornay who starts the film breaking out of a women's prison in New Mexico. Robin wants to be a rock star( who doesn't ? ) and cannot stand being caged up thus foiling her career ambitions. After a too easy escape Robin is picked up hitching by a big shot politician named James Tiernan who is running for New Mexico's governors seat and has prison reform as part of his platform. Once Tiernan learns Robin has escaped he makes it a point to return her to jail. But he's smitten with her and wishes her luck and a swift parole. Robin actually calls Tiernan from jail later and asks him for advice on how to make parole and if he could put a good word in for her. He says he will and tells Robin that if she were to marry while in jail that it could help her get a release earlier than normal. While Robin was making her way back to jail earlier she had a quick fling with handyman/carpenter Billy Moran . Thinking Moran would be suitable husband material (and patsy) she makes him an offer marry her and she'll give him $5,000 .Billy needing the money and smitten with Robin as well reluctantly agrees. The large part of the rest of the film centers on the fragile relationship between Billy and Robin. The whole marriage thing is a farce as Robin has limited domestic ability and has no interest in Billy other than he's a means to an end. Billy meanwhile is a single Dad who has a son and his younger brother living with him .Billy's first wife ran off on him leaving him with a son and a weird sense of what marriage entails. The biggest problem I had story wise was how hard it was to actually like the Robin character. The writers seemed to try and recreate De Mornay's famous role of Lana the hooker from Risky Business and make it a bit lighter but still basically the same character.Both Lana and Robin are users who use other people for their own self interests. Lana used Tom Cruises naive and horny suburban teen as a way to escape a brutal pimp and make a living .She develops feelings for him later but it's a union that has no long term viability. Here Robin uses Billy played by Vincent Spano(very well by the way) to have a place to stay a base of operations so to speak while she attempts to launch her music career .She also trying to use Tiernan as a way to stay out of jail and use his political cache and his wealth to her advantage. Robin like Lana is a product of a broken home and has a very tough veneer that she does not want anyone to penetrate. Plus while it was obvious that Lana being a prostitute would use sex Robin also uses sex as a way to torment Billy and to seduce Tiernan .She also knows men find her attractive especially her butt and legs and uses those assets to her advantage,At one point while auditioning for a gig a promoter says to Robin "" You've got a great ass but a not so great voice"" And at a local dive bar performance with her band later on in the film Robin's non stop grinding and humping gets the males in the audience over excited and a brawl breaks out. Meanwhile while Robin is using Tiernan he's also using her for his political purposes .Having a young and beautiful ex-con as his model prisoner reformed works well for his image.James Tiernan played stoically and maturely by Frank Langella is a shrewd political animal who's way ahead of Robin even if he does give in to lust and have a fling with her. While Tiernan is the amoral creep in this film a man who'll do anything to score political clout Langella makes him seem human. The general tone of the film is a mix of drama and comedy though it's not a slapstick or raunchy sense of humor almost a black humor runs thru the film. The last 1/3 of the film becomes a made for tv level story where everything is going to end up right even if the previous 2/3rds of the film leads you to believe otherwise. Given what they wanted Robin to be basically Lana as a more comedic anti heroine Rebecca De Mornay does an admirable job as a lesser actress would make you loathe the character and maybe shut the movie off. Of course the film does it's best to showcase the beauty of Rebecca in various sex scenes and shower scenes even her seductive movements while playing bass onstage .They never let you forget that she's a beautiful woman who's using what's she's got to get what she wants.If you can't get enough De Mornay then you will likely enjoy this remake.",3,Rebecca De Mornay Redux?,1356480000,"12 26,
