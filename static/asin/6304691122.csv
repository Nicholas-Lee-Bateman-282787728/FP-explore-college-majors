432327,AD84ZN1ZQBSSH,6304691122,Angie,"[26, 26]","The tv mini-series, in all its true glory, died in the 80s. Jane Seymour and Jacqueline Smith were the queens of the shamelessly fun ones such as ""Crossings"" and ""Rage of Angels,"" but the oh-so-underrated Madolyn Smith brought adorable innocence to the table when she debuted in ""If Tomorrow Comes.""I used to drive my sister crazy during 1986 as I'd watch ""ITC"" over and over on the VHS cassette I'd used to tape the 3-night miniseries. One day in the late 90s I was shopping and I spotted the movie on professional VHS. Forgetting where I was, I squealed out loud in excitement and an elderly woman nearby looked at me with alarm before she scurried off faster than I'd ever seen anyone move. I probably should have restrained myself, but I had lost my copy years before and all the good memories I'd had of it came flooding back right there in the store.If only ""If Tomorrow Comes"" were on DVD...It seems clunky now to go through all three tapes, but it's still worth it, watching the story of the way-too-trusting Tracy Whitney as she faces betrayal and injustice before she battles her way back with a charm and vengeance that can only come from deep suffering and a need for closure.There are so many reasons to like ""ITC,"" but if I had to list five of them...--Revenge has never been so sweetly calculated or free of violence. (I enjoy David Mamet's brand of the dirty double cross, but sometimes it's nice to see the softer side of retribution.)--It's always neat to see talented actors in their earlier days (i.e. CCH Pounder, Tom Berenger, Liam Neeson.)--Madolyn Smith is so endearing here AND she shows so much promise as an actress. You have to wonder why she didn't go on to do bigger and better things. (""Funny Farm,"" while cute and harmless enough, just doesn't hold up to what she does in ""If Tomorrow Comes."")--Tom Berenger!! (Those of you who appreciate Mr. Berenger's sex appeal and understated acting will understand! To this day, I still don't get why he isn't more well-known and valued.)--No other tv movie that followed ever recaptured the true guilty pleasure spirit of the ""big"" mini-series (except for the very serious and unforgettable ""War and Remembrance,"" which falls under ""big"" rather than ""guilty pleasure"" since it had a very important message and hardly could be considered light fare.)Give ""tomorrow"" a chance! I would suggest you hold out and wait for a DVD release (which might offer a clearer picture resolution) but it doesn't look like that's on the horizon...",5,Before the mini-series  losts its fun and charming side,1124236800,"08 17, 2005",2005,2501,"['tv', 'mini-series', 'true', 'glory', 'died', '80s', 'Jane', 'Seymour', 'Jacqueline', 'Smith', 'were', 'queens', 'shamelessly', 'fun', 'ones', 'such', 'Crossings', 'Rage', 'Angels', 'oh-so-underrated', 'Madolyn', 'Smith', 'brought', 'adorable', 'innocence', 'table', 'when', 'debuted', 'Tomorrow', 'Comes', 'used', 'drive', 'sister', 'crazy', '1986', ""'d"", 'watch', 'ITC', 'VHS', 'cassette', ""'d"", 'used', 'tape', '3-night', 'miniseries', 'One', 'day', 'late', '90s', 'was', 'shopping', 'spotted', 'movie', 'professional', 'VHS', 'Forgetting', 'where', 'was', 'squealed', 'out', 'loud', 'excitement', 'elderly', 'woman', 'nearby', 'looked', 'alarm', 'scurried', 'off', 'faster', ""'d"", 'ever', 'seen', 'anyone', 'move', 'probably', 'should', 'have', 'restrained', 'had', 'lost', 'copy', 'years', 'good', 'memories', ""'d"", 'had', 'came', 'flooding', 'back', 'right', 'store.If', 'only', 'Tomorrow', 'Comes', 'were', 'DVD', 'clunky', 'now', 'go', 'three', 'tapes', 'still', 'worth', 'watching', 'story', 'way-too-trusting', 'Tracy', 'Whitney', 'betrayal', 'injustice', 'way', 'back', 'charm', 'vengeance', 'can', 'only', 'come', 'deep', 'suffering', 'need', 'closure.There', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'reasons', 'like', 'ITC', 'had', 'list', 'five', 'Revenge', 'never', 'been', 'so', 'sweetly', 'calculated', 'free', 'violence', 'enjoy', 'David', 'Mamet', 'brand', 'dirty', 'double', 'cross', 'nice', 'see', 'softer', 'side', 'retribution', 'always', 'neat', 'see', 'talented', 'actors', 'earlier', 'days', 'i.e', 'CCH', 'Pounder', 'Tom', 'Berenger', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'Madolyn', 'Smith', 'so', 'endearing', 'here', 'AND', 'so', 'much', 'promise', 'actress', 'have', 'wonder', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'go', 'do', 'bigger', 'better', 'things', 'Funny', 'Farm', 'cute', 'harmless', 'enough', 'just', ""n't"", 'hold', 'up', 'what', 'Tomorrow', 'Comes', 'Tom', 'Berenger', 'who', 'appreciate', 'Mr.', 'Berenger', 'sex', 'appeal', 'understated', 'acting', 'will', 'understand', 'day', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'why', ""n't"", 'more', 'well-known', 'valued', 'other', 'tv', 'movie', 'followed', 'ever', 'recaptured', 'true', 'guilty', 'pleasure', 'spirit', 'big', 'mini-series', 'very', 'serious', 'unforgettable', 'War', 'Remembrance', 'big', 'rather', 'guilty', 'pleasure', 'had', 'very', 'important', 'message', 'hardly', 'could', 'be', 'considered', 'light', 'fare', 'Give', 'tomorrow', 'chance', 'would', 'suggest', 'hold', 'out', 'wait', 'DVD', 'release', 'might', 'offer', 'clearer', 'picture', 'resolution', ""n't"", 'look', 'horizon']",If Tomorrow Comes VHS

432341,A345LHAQGP98AX,6304691122,"Martin Boucher ""Authorfan""","[4, 4]","Sidney Sheldon is without a doubt one of the best storyteller around. His clever way of creating high-power glitter and adventure always leaves one yearning for more. The same could be said about his adaptations to the big or small screen. From The Other Side of Midnight to Master of the Game, every celluloid delivery of his work is a must-see event, just like IF TOMORROW COMES, now on VHS from StarMaker. This 318-minute treat takes you into the world of cat burglary in which the sweet and innocent bank representative, Tracy Whitney, becomes one of the most sought-after criminals of her generation. You'll have a ball watching her get out of the unimaginable, and does she; once about every 10 minutes; some are hard to swallow but they're never dull. Madolyn Smith is a joy to watch as Tracy, whether she's being abused in prison or abusing the system. Her presence adds sparks to a feisty yet stereotypical heroine. The only downside is the all-too-wooden participation of David Keith as the insurance investigator who's on Tracy's tail. His over-the-top performance makes a dent in an otherwise talented cast of characters (Liam Neeson, Tom Berrenger, Richard Kiley, CCH Pounder). Still, the ride to this glitzy gem is a hot and bumpy one.

True, it is dated now (the fashions and the technology) but that doesn't matter. It's great fun. Some of the plot devices rely on a lack of technology -- computers were not at all mainstream, and the Internet was an obscure thing back in the mid-'80s. But the cleverness of some of the antics these characters pull is still entertaining. It's even a little *more* entertaining when you realize that thanks to our current technology, they'd never get away with that today.It's also amazing to see the star power in this film. True, Madolyn Smith isn't seen too much these days, but she's truly remarkable. Beautiful and yet with a sparkle that transcends beauty. And she does well in different disguises and using accents! Very good.The same year Tom Berenger did this fun miniseries, he also did his Oscar-nominated performance playing a twisted soldier in ""Platoon"". The characters in these two films could not be any more different. In this film, Berenger plays a good-natured playboy and con man who is easy-going yet strong and resourceful.Other stars include David Keith, who's done all sorts of parts through the years (he played Richard Gere's friend in ""An Officer and a Gentleman""). In this he plays a tormented and unbalanced investigator who is on the trail of our hero and heroine. Even though he doesn't have a huge part, Liam Neeson is also featured in this miniseries (he plays a police detective). Other strong performances come from Richard Kiley, CCH Pounder and Charles Rocket, and a few more.The story I won't go into too much; suffice it to say it follows the lives of two people -- Smith, who starts out being framed for a crime she didn't commit, and Berenger, who is a con-man who *tries* to go straight.

The female lead was such a terrible actress I cringed everytime she got an expression on her face.  I don't write many reviews but felt I should warn anyone who wants to purchase this dvd.  All the male actors were great and the story was great of course. But I had a hard time finishing the film. Don't waste your money.
