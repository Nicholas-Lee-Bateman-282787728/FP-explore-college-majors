But then, I've always wanted to be an architect (does the name ""Art Vandalay"" ring a bell?), so I'm not sure if my opinion of this movie is representative of general perceptions of this movie.Even so, I've never been that amazed by Louis Kahn's work; it always seemed too cold and brutal for my tastes. But after watching this film and understanding that Kahn was striving for genuine monuments that stood the test of time, I can see them in a new, more appreciative light. And learning of Kahn's circumstances -- a scarred Estonian immigrant eventually rising to a position of great repute -- humanized for me a man whose style always seemed impersonal and distant.While the film does meander, it was particularly interesting for me was to hear famous architects speak firsthand. They include Philip Johnson (charming and funny), Frank O. Gehry (not much to say, really), and I.M. Pei (warm and polite). And in marked contrast, there's Philadelphia city planner Edmund Bacon (father of actor Kevin Bacon) who comes across as a near-violent creep. Oy vey!",4,Interesting and Intermittently Touching...

872028,A30TQET02FLSUX,B0006Q93EM,BLACKBOXBLUE,"[0, 0]","I watched this movie on DVD probably 5 years ago.  Obviously I am very biased towards movies about architecture being an architect.  But I would still argue that anyone can love this movie, even though it's officially a ""documentary"", because it's really a very emotional tale about the love a son has for his father.  Director Nathaniel Kahn, son of famous architect Louis Kahn whom this movie is a biography about, crafted an unbelievably vibrant, poetic and poignant film about his deceased father and his work.  Nathaniel's intention was to gain an understanding and appreciation of his father.  He didn't really know his father when he was alive.  He was just 11 years old when he died, and because Nathaniel was an ""illegitimate"" son, Louis didn't live with him and his mother, preferring to stay with his wife.Louis Kahn was an architect like Terrence Malick is a Film Director: a perfectionist whose work can be counted on your hands.  Louis Kahn is not known for producing hundreds or thousands of buildings like his contemporaries Frank Lloyd Wright, Mies van der Rohe, and Philip Johnson.  Instead, he crafted just a couple handfuls of masterpiece buildings over his lengthy career.  And none of his work is missed in this wonderful journey through his life and architecture.  Having studied Kahn's work in architecture school, you would have thought that I would have already fully appreciated Louis Kahn as a master architect.  But to be honest, while I liked Kahn's work prior to seeing this film, it's solely because of this film that I now regard Louis Kahn as one of my favorite architects of all time, if not #1.  I had never seen any of Kahn's buildings in person, but the filming of them in this movie along with the emotional storytelling from his son simply gave me the appreciation for Kahn and his work like nothing had before.  And upon seeing Kahn's Salk Institute Buildings in La Jolla, California in person last year, I was blown away at the beauty, serenity and minimalism of his design.  The attention to detail, craftsmanship, and shear thought that went into his buildings is amazing.",4,Perfection in Architecture & Filmmaking,1286236800,"10 5, 2010",2010,2116,"['watched', 'movie', 'DVD', 'probably', '5', 'years', 'ago', 'Obviously', 'am', 'very', 'biased', 'towards', 'movies', 'architecture', 'being', 'architect', 'would', 'still', 'argue', 'anyone', 'can', 'love', 'movie', 'even', 'officially', 'documentary', 'really', 'very', 'emotional', 'tale', 'love', 'son', 'father', 'Director', 'Nathaniel', 'Kahn', 'son', 'famous', 'architect', 'Louis', 'Kahn', 'whom', 'movie', 'biography', 'crafted', 'unbelievably', 'vibrant', 'poetic', 'poignant', 'film', 'deceased', 'father', 'work', 'Nathaniel', 'intention', 'was', 'gain', 'understanding', 'appreciation', 'father', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'know', 'father', 'when', 'was', 'alive', 'was', 'just', '11', 'years', 'old', 'when', 'died', 'Nathaniel', 'was', 'illegitimate', 'son', 'Louis', 'did', ""n't"", 'live', 'mother', 'preferring', 'stay', 'wife.Louis', 'Kahn', 'was', 'architect', 'Terrence', 'Malick', 'Film', 'Director', 'perfectionist', 'work', 'can', 'be', 'counted', 'hands', 'Louis', 'Kahn', 'not', 'known', 'producing', 'hundreds', 'thousands', 'buildings', 'contemporaries', 'Frank', 'Lloyd', 'Wright', 'Mies', 'van', 'der', 'Rohe', 'Philip', 'Johnson', 'Instead', 'crafted', 'just', 'couple', 'handfuls', 'masterpiece', 'buildings', 'lengthy', 'career', 'none', 'work', 'missed', 'wonderful', 'journey', 'life', 'architecture', 'Having', 'studied', 'Kahn', 'work', 'architecture', 'school', 'would', 'have', 'thought', 'would', 'have', 'already', 'fully', 'appreciated', 'Louis', 'Kahn', 'master', 'architect', 'be', 'honest', 'liked', 'Kahn', 'work', 'prior', 'seeing', 'film', 'solely', 'film', 'now', 'regard', 'Louis', 'Kahn', 'one', 'favorite', 'architects', 'time', 'not', '1', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'Kahn', 'buildings', 'person', 'filming', 'movie', 'emotional', 'storytelling', 'son', 'simply', 'gave', 'appreciation', 'Kahn', 'work', 'nothing', 'had', 'seeing', 'Kahn', 'Salk', 'Institute', 'Buildings', 'La', 'Jolla', 'California', 'person', 'last', 'year', 'was', 'blown', 'away', 'beauty', 'serenity', 'minimalism', 'design', 'attention', 'detail', 'craftsmanship', 'shear', 'thought', 'went', 'buildings', 'amazing']",N/A
872029,A1WZ1C8TEC51IY,B0006Q93EM,"Christopher Schmitz ""Flaming Intellectual""","[13, 13]","I bought this documentary on a whim because I enjoyed ""Supersize Me"" and ""Farenheit 9/11.""  My sense now is that the genre of the documentary is entering a golden age, since the ones I've seen lately, including ""My Architect,"" seem superior by far to mainstream dramas and comedies.The basic premise here, easy to grasp, is the journey of the ""illegitimate"" son of American architect Louis Khan to discover who his shadowy father was by talking to people who knew him and by viewing and assessing his dad's work.  This yields much humor and pathos.  The people the younger Khan speaks to include A-list architects like I. M Pei and Phillip Johnson as well as ordinary Joes and are an interesting lot with compelling things to say about the Jewish design wizard.Exploring Khan's buildings through his son's camera proves an even greater treat.  Highlights include the sprawling sea-splashed Salk Institute on the California coast and the stunning light-suffused Capital building in Dacca, Bangladesh.  What really endears us to the subject matter is that neither the weaknesses of the architect father nor his documentarian are swept away; rather they're discussed openly, and both come across as real--fragile flawed but immensely talented.This film, a great balance of educational and emotional elements, is so worthwhile and enjoyable it's encouraged me to give the whole documentary genre a fresh look.  I appreciate a discussion of architecture that wasn't dumbed down for the audience, such as when the film discussed the influence of ancient ruins, bombastic and timeless, on Khan's work.

I was utterly floored by the emotional impact of Nathaniel Kahn's journey into his father's past.  As Kahn's appreciation of his father's professional accomplishments expands, so, too, does his sense of loss for the absentee father whom he knew only fleetingly, and who died when he was eleven.  By the end of the film, when we see the reverence with which Kahn is viewed in India (where he is considered a sort of yogi or guru for his transformation of matter into ""light and silence""), and in Bangladesh (where his enormous personal and financial sacrifice to build the governmental center made him a martyr in the eyes of many), we may come to view his problematic moral and family choices as simply the byproduct of a mind focused on universal themes.  But this does not negate the intense pain he caused his several families, and it is instructive that someone so generous and talented was also the instrument of so much personal suffering to those who loved him most.  The filmmaker explores all of this with unflinching honesty, enhanced by wonderful camera work and an evocative soundtrack; he has created a work of art entirely worthy of his famous father's legacy.",5,"Phenomenal architect, phenomenal film",1112313600,"04 1, 2005",2005,1294,"['film', 'just', 'beautifully', 'personal', 'narrative', 'exploration', 'Kahn', 'visionary', 'architecture', 'was', 'utterly', 'floored', 'emotional', 'impact', 'Nathaniel', 'Kahn', 'journey', 'father', 'past', 'Kahn', 'appreciation', 'father', 'professional', 'accomplishments', 'expands', 'so', 'too', 'sense', 'loss', 'absentee', 'father', 'whom', 'knew', 'only', 'fleetingly', 'who', 'died', 'when', 'was', 'eleven', 'end', 'film', 'when', 'see', 'reverence', 'Kahn', 'viewed', 'India', 'where', 'considered', 'sort', 'yogi', 'guru', 'transformation', 'matter', 'light', 'silence', 'Bangladesh', 'where', 'enormous', 'personal', 'financial', 'sacrifice', 'build', 'governmental', 'center', 'made', 'martyr', 'eyes', 'many', 'may', 'come', 'view', 'problematic', 'moral', 'family', 'choices', 'simply', 'byproduct', 'mind', 'focused', 'universal', 'themes', 'not', 'negate', 'intense', 'pain', 'caused', 'several', 'families', 'instructive', 'someone', 'so', 'generous', 'talented', 'was', 'also', 'instrument', 'so', 'much', 'personal', 'suffering', 'who', 'loved', 'most', 'filmmaker', 'unflinching', 'honesty', 'enhanced', 'wonderful', 'camera', 'work', 'evocative', 'soundtrack', 'created', 'work', 'art', 'entirely', 'worthy', 'famous', 'father', 'legacy']",N/A

On this venture, the audience, learns that Nathaniel was one of two children that Louis had out of wedlock.  Louis had two affairs outside of his marriage in which he had children.  It becomes an emotional turmoil for him and his relatives, as he begins to dig up the old news of his father.  Nonetheless, Nathaniel remains firm on continuing his discovery of his father, as he meets with his other sisters and family members.  Along the way, he learns that it was suggested to have him aborted while he still was a fetus.  Also, he learns that Louis' wife, whom he stayed married to throughout life, never acknowledged him or his sister who were born out of wedlock.Nathaniel visits with architects that praised and critiqued his father while all expressed their admiration for his determination to make artistic masterpieces.  Employees of Louis Kahn tell both fond and callous memories of him, while all agree that he had a noble work ethic and mental toughness.  For example, one former employee tells a story of how he received an assignment to build a model with very short notice, as Louis had to go on a business trip.  Three days later when Louis returned from his trip he called him at three o'clock in the morning and told him that the model was crap.  In another interview an architect in Bangladesh describes him as next to divine, as he designed the National Assembly in Dacca, which signifies that country's independence.Despite what people might think they know of Louis I. Kahn it becomes obvious in the documentary that this Jewish boy who emigrated from Estonia when he was just a child had a tough upbringing--an upbringing that colored his life, as he was willing to reach out to all people of the world regardless of ethnicity, religion, and race.  His care and nurturing affection spread his joy of architectural art throughout the world and is evident through his work in Dacca, Bangladesh, as he was a Jew helping a Muslim country erecting their symbol of freedom.  Maybe, as suggested in the film, his love was so great that he did not have the ability to be there for those closest to him.  Maybe, Nathaniel was therefore able to discover who his father was through his journey in My Architect: A Son's Journey.",5,Poignant Journey Through Architecture...,1110240000,"03 8, 2005",2005,3052,"['Architecture', 'other', 'art', 'forms', 'interaction', 'art', 'people', 'live', 'work', 'spend', 'leisure', 'erected', 'structures', 'architecture', 'Louis', 'I.', 'Kahn', 'lived', 'create', 'useful', 'monumental', 'masterpieces', 'now', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'world', 'places', 'such', 'La', 'Jolla', 'California', 'Dacca', 'Bangladesh', 'Ahmedabad', 'India', 'other', 'buildings', 'Kahn', 'changed', 'perspective', 'architecture', 'contemporary', 'architects', 'study', 'light', 'Kahn', 'was', 'renowned', 'bankrupt', 'architect', 'who', 'was', 'discovered', 'dead', 'men', 'room', 'Penn', 'Station', 'identification', 'papers.In', 'My', 'Architect', 'Son', 'Journey', 'audience', 'follow', 'Nathaniel', 'Kahn', 'expedition', 'discover', 'whom', 'father', 'was', 'never', 'got', 'opportunity', 'get', 'know', 'child', 'venture', 'audience', 'Nathaniel', 'was', 'one', 'two', 'children', 'Louis', 'had', 'wedlock', 'Louis', 'had', 'two', 'affairs', 'marriage', 'had', 'children', 'emotional', 'turmoil', 'relatives', 'dig', 'up', 'old', 'news', 'father', 'Nonetheless', 'Nathaniel', 'firm', 'continuing', 'discovery', 'father', 'other', 'sisters', 'family', 'members', 'way', 'was', 'suggested', 'have', 'aborted', 'still', 'was', 'fetus', 'Also', 'Louis', 'wife', 'whom', 'stayed', 'married', 'life', 'never', 'acknowledged', 'sister', 'who', 'were', 'born', 'wedlock.Nathaniel', 'visits', 'architects', 'praised', 'critiqued', 'father', 'expressed', 'admiration', 'determination', 'make', 'artistic', 'masterpieces', 'Employees', 'Louis', 'Kahn', 'tell', 'fond', 'callous', 'memories', 'agree', 'had', 'noble', 'work', 'ethic', 'mental', 'toughness', 'example', 'one', 'former', 'employee', 'story', 'how', 'received', 'assignment', 'build', 'model', 'very', 'short', 'notice', 'Louis', 'had', 'go', 'business', 'trip', 'Three', 'days', 'later', 'when', 'Louis', 'returned', 'trip', 'called', 'three', ""o'clock"", 'morning', 'told', 'model', 'was', 'crap', 'interview', 'architect', 'Bangladesh', 'next', 'divine', 'designed', 'National', 'Assembly', 'Dacca', 'country', 'independence.Despite', 'what', 'people', 'might', 'think', 'know', 'Louis', 'I.', 'Kahn', 'obvious', 'documentary', 'Jewish', 'boy', 'who', 'emigrated', 'Estonia', 'when', 'was', 'just', 'child', 'had', 'tough', 'upbringing', 'upbringing', 'colored', 'life', 'was', 'willing', 'reach', 'out', 'people', 'world', 'regardless', 'ethnicity', 'religion', 'race', 'care', 'nurturing', 'affection', 'spread', 'joy', 'architectural', 'art', 'world', 'evident', 'work', 'Dacca', 'Bangladesh', 'was', 'Jew', 'helping', 'Muslim', 'country', 'erecting', 'symbol', 'freedom', 'Maybe', 'suggested', 'film', 'love', 'was', 'so', 'great', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'ability', 'be', 'there', 'closest', 'Maybe', 'Nathaniel', 'was', 'therefore', 'able', 'discover', 'who', 'father', 'was', 'journey', 'My', 'Architect', 'Son', 'Journey']",N/A
872039,A1IVTR2NM09JEI,B0006Q93EM,Laura Grey,"[1, 1]","Louis I. Kahn (1901-1974) was one of the 20th century's most influential and well-regarded architects. He designed such important structures as the Exeter Library at Philips Exeter Academy, and the Capital Complex in Dhaka (Dacca), Bangladesh, and his work was revered by high-flying architects such as I. M. Pei, Philip Johnson, and Frank Gehry. But his habits of overwork and overextension, bidding for too many projects and becoming obsessive about his all-consuming passion for architecture, led him to die of a heart attack, bankrupt and alone, in a Penn Station bathroom as he was on his way home to Philadelphia from New York. When he died, he left not only a wife and their daughter, but also a mistress and his second daughter, as well as a second mistress and his third child, his 11-year-old son, Nathaniel, who made this beautiful documentary about his father, ""My Architect: A Son's Journey.""Nathaniel Kahn's documentary visits and discusses the works of his father, some of which Nathaniel had never seen before, and shows the emotional and artistic impact that Louis Kahn and his work made on others, both architects and clients. But more than being a simple homage to his father and his works, the film shows Nathaniel's search to understand his secretive, mysterious father's compartmentalized life and to strengthen his connection to the father he lost so early. Louis Kahn's charisma and charm, his love for his children and the feelings of great love and loyalty he engendered in the women in his life are all made clear, as are his self-absorption, his need to make every commitment in life secondary to his commitment to his work, his flashes of arrogance, and his lack of empathy for others. The question which underpins the whole film is whether the gifts of an artistic genius whose work engenders tears of appreciation from his clients and fellow architects can justify his remote, selfish, and disconnected life.Nathaniel Kahn doesn't try to answer any of these questions once and for all. He asks difficult questions and presses those he interviews (from great architects to his own mother) to be honest about his father's failings and selfishness as well as his brilliance and occasional tenderness. The responses are at times surprising and always touching.",5,A moving account of a great artist's life and impact,1196812800,"12 5, 2007",2007,2287,"['Louis', 'I.', 'Kahn', '1901-1974', 'was', 'one', '20th', 'century', 'most', 'influential', 'well-regarded', 'architects', 'designed', 'such', 'important', 'structures', 'Exeter', 'Library', 'Philips', 'Exeter', 'Academy', 'Capital', 'Complex', 'Dhaka', 'Dacca', 'Bangladesh', 'work', 'was', 'revered', 'high-flying', 'architects', 'such', 'I.', 'M.', 'Pei', 'Philip', 'Johnson', 'Frank', 'Gehry', 'habits', 'overwork', 'overextension', 'bidding', 'too', 'many', 'projects', 'becoming', 'obsessive', 'all-consuming', 'passion', 'architecture', 'led', 'die', 'heart', 'attack', 'bankrupt', 'alone', 'Penn', 'Station', 'bathroom', 'was', 'way', 'home', 'Philadelphia', 'New', 'York', 'When', 'died', 'left', 'not', 'only', 'wife', 'daughter', 'also', 'mistress', 'second', 'daughter', 'as', 'well', 'second', 'mistress', 'third', 'child', '11-year-old', 'son', 'Nathaniel', 'who', 'made', 'beautiful', 'documentary', 'father', 'Architect', 'Son', 'Journey', 'Nathaniel', 'Kahn', 'documentary', 'visits', 'works', 'father', 'Nathaniel', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'emotional', 'artistic', 'impact', 'Louis', 'Kahn', 'work', 'made', 'others', 'architects', 'clients', 'more', 'being', 'simple', 'homage', 'father', 'works', 'film', 'Nathaniel', 'search', 'understand', 'secretive', 'mysterious', 'father', 'compartmentalized', 'life', 'strengthen', 'connection', 'father', 'lost', 'so', 'early', 'Louis', 'Kahn', 'charisma', 'charm', 'love', 'children', 'feelings', 'great', 'love', 'loyalty', 'engendered', 'women', 'life', 'are', 'made', 'clear', 'are', 'self-absorption', 'need', 'make', 'commitment', 'life', 'secondary', 'commitment', 'work', 'flashes', 'arrogance', 'lack', 'empathy', 'others', 'question', 'whole', 'film', 'gifts', 'artistic', 'genius', 'work', 'engenders', 'tears', 'appreciation', 'clients', 'fellow', 'architects', 'can', 'justify', 'remote', 'selfish', 'disconnected', 'life.Nathaniel', 'Kahn', ""n't"", 'try', 'answer', 'questions', 'once', 'difficult', 'questions', 'presses', 'great', 'architects', 'own', 'mother', 'be', 'honest', 'father', 'failings', 'selfishness', 'as', 'well', 'brilliance', 'occasional', 'tenderness', 'responses', 'are', 'times', 'surprising', 'always', 'touching']",N/A

872044,A2I3XS9TO93Q0F,B0006Q93EM,"Michael Meredith ""e-Mike""","[4, 8]","In some ways, after watching this film I feel like I know Nathaniel Kahn much better than his father, the great architect Louis Kahn.  Certainly he is ambitious, with his attempt to merge two stories into one documentary.  One story centers around Nat's exploration of his father's relationships; his relationship with Nat the son of one of Louis' mistresses, Louis's relationship with his wife and two lovers, and how Louis dealt with his clients, colleagues and the world.  It's not a story that can be told in a simple manner.  Louis Kahn was an incredibly complicated genius, one whose dealings with people were on a different plane than most.  How better to explain the reality of a man with three almost simultaneous families?The other story is a bit more straightforward in that it delves into Kahn's body of design  work, which ranges from compact bath houses and homes, to large research buildings and almost epic-sized governmental complexes; with a floating (and traveling) concert hall thrown in for good measure.I shudder to think how long this film could have been, had not Nathaniel had the restraint to keep it at a manageable length.  Combining the tale of a basically flawed human being with an examination of a creative genius' work is ambitious enough, factor in the fact that the flawed human being and the creative genius are the father he barely knew and you have an incredibly personal film.There is a lot to appreciate here, from Nat's conversation with his two half-sisters and other relatives; to those with colleagues who knew of Louis' semi-secret offspring, men who watched with wry or detached amazement at the person that was Louis Kahn.  From the architectural perspective, Nat proves to be a critical and reverential documenter.  Buildings that look striking, yet fail from a functional perspective (like some of the work of Frank Lloyd Wright, some of his buildings had roofs that leaked) are included along with those that achieve masterpiece status for both the outside observer and those who live and work within.Nat's work is augmented by earlier footage from other documentarians that allow us to see Louis in his element, strutting down the street, sketching a design or talking about his ideas.  Comments from clients and associates often reveal more about themselves, particularly an urban planner for the city of Philadelphia whose own ego would seem to be the major cause of his conflicts with Louis (forty years later he is just as passionately convinced about how right he was and how wrong Louis was, which makes for a most amusing, albeit small, segment).The paradoxes in the life of Louis Kahn are many -- a Jewish immigrant whose crowning achievement is the capital building for a Moslem nation, yet he had no major commissions for a Jewish synagogue or temple despite numerous preliminary designs and competitions.  He was also a distant, but not completely out of touch father, for his daughter with his wife and the son and daughter of his two mistresses.  And finally, we have the world famous architect, a man regarded as certainly one of the most prominent designers of the Twentieth Century, yet he died penniless in a train station with a passport that he himself had defaced.  Nathaniel's search for the meaning and inspiration behind Louis, his life and his work is a story that makes for a very interesting film.  He may never make a more personal film, but I hope he uses his talent to do so with many other subjects.",3,"Genius in Design, but a Flawed Person",1120608000,"07 6, 2005",2005,3480,"['ways', 'watching', 'film', 'feel', 'know', 'Nathaniel', 'Kahn', 'much', 'better', 'father', 'great', 'architect', 'Louis', 'Kahn', 'Certainly', 'ambitious', 'attempt', 'merge', 'two', 'stories', 'one', 'documentary', 'One', 'story', 'centers', 'Nat', 'exploration', 'father', 'relationships', 'relationship', 'Nat', 'son', 'one', 'Louis', 'mistresses', 'Louis', 'relationship', 'wife', 'two', 'lovers', 'how', 'Louis', 'dealt', 'clients', 'colleagues', 'world', 'not', 'story', 'can', 'be', 'told', 'simple', 'manner', 'Louis', 'Kahn', 'was', 'incredibly', 'complicated', 'genius', 'one', 'dealings', 'people', 'were', 'different', 'plane', 'most', 'How', 'better', 'explain', 'reality', 'man', 'three', 'almost', 'simultaneous', 'families', 'other', 'story', 'bit', 'more', 'straightforward', 'Kahn', 'body', 'design', 'work', 'compact', 'bath', 'houses', 'homes', 'large', 'research', 'buildings', 'almost', 'epic-sized', 'governmental', 'complexes', 'floating', 'traveling', 'concert', 'hall', 'thrown', 'good', 'measure.I', 'shudder', 'think', 'how', 'long', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'had', 'not', 'Nathaniel', 'had', 'restraint', 'keep', 'manageable', 'length', 'Combining', 'tale', 'basically', 'flawed', 'human', 'being', 'examination', 'creative', 'genius', 'work', 'ambitious', 'enough', 'factor', 'fact', 'flawed', 'human', 'being', 'creative', 'genius', 'are', 'father', 'barely', 'knew', 'have', 'incredibly', 'personal', 'film.There', 'lot', 'appreciate', 'here', 'Nat', 'conversation', 'two', 'half-sisters', 'other', 'relatives', 'colleagues', 'who', 'knew', 'Louis', 'semi-secret', 'offspring', 'men', 'who', 'watched', 'wry', 'detached', 'amazement', 'person', 'was', 'Louis', 'Kahn', 'architectural', 'perspective', 'Nat', 'be', 'critical', 'reverential', 'documenter', 'Buildings', 'look', 'striking', 'yet', 'fail', 'functional', 'perspective', 'work', 'Frank', 'Lloyd', 'Wright', 'buildings', 'had', 'roofs', 'leaked', 'are', 'included', 'achieve', 'masterpiece', 'status', 'outside', 'observer', 'who', 'live', 'work', 'within.Nat', 'work', 'augmented', 'earlier', 'footage', 'other', 'documentarians', 'allow', 'see', 'Louis', 'element', 'strutting', 'down', 'street', 'sketching', 'design', 'talking', 'ideas', 'Comments', 'clients', 'associates', 'often', 'reveal', 'more', 'particularly', 'urban', 'planner', 'city', 'Philadelphia', 'own', 'ego', 'would', 'seem', 'be', 'major', 'cause', 'conflicts', 'Louis', 'forty', 'years', 'later', 'just', 'passionately', 'convinced', 'how', 'right', 'was', 'how', 'wrong', 'Louis', 'was', 'most', 'amusing', 'small', 'segment', '.The', 'paradoxes', 'life', 'Louis', 'Kahn', 'are', 'many', 'Jewish', 'immigrant', 'crowning', 'achievement', 'capital', 'building', 'Moslem', 'nation', 'yet', 'had', 'major', 'commissions', 'Jewish', 'synagogue', 'temple', 'numerous', 'preliminary', 'designs', 'competitions', 'was', 'also', 'distant', 'not', 'completely', 'touch', 'father', 'daughter', 'wife', 'son', 'daughter', 'two', 'mistresses', 'finally', 'have', 'world', 'famous', 'architect', 'man', 'regarded', 'certainly', 'one', 'most', 'prominent', 'designers', 'Twentieth', 'Century', 'yet', 'died', 'penniless', 'train', 'station', 'passport', 'had', 'defaced', 'Nathaniel', 'search', 'meaning', 'inspiration', 'Louis', 'life', 'work', 'story', 'very', 'interesting', 'film', 'may', 'never', 'make', 'more', 'personal', 'film', 'hope', 'talent', 'do', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'subjects']",N/A

Although physically less than attractive, Kahn's magnetism seduced two appealing young women and resulted in two illegitimate offspring.

The essence of the Director, Louis Kahn's ""bastard"" son (as the Director called himself) was to discover his father via interviewing his colleagues (I M Pei, Philip Johnson), his admirers (Frank Gehry), his critic (the name has escaped me but the person that blocked Louis' utopian vision of having a non-vehicle city of Philadelphia, his ex-employees, his mistresses, his friends (in Bangladesh and India and happened to be architects in their own rights), viewing his works (some soaring in spiritual heights and grandeur and some simply polarised opinions).  As the movie concluded, the Director said succinctly that he finally rediscovered his relationship with his Dad and it's time to move on after finishing this project.  As some people said in this documentary, it's essential that Louis is seen as a fallible human-being but not a being of extraordinary capabilities.  They continued to say that whilst there's no denying he made mistakes, that's offset by all contributions that he made to humankind and a person that sacrificed so much for his art at the expense of his families and his livelihood.  This documentary comprised of many aspects that I didn't know of Louis Kahn and irrespective if it's catering to architectural buff like myself or to people who simply wanted to engage in splendid human story, this documentary is it.  Whilst documentary is a bit crass, like Louis Kahn's belief, honesty and integrity in art is pivotal and I think his son would make him a very proud father indeed.  This documentary comes in square format.  Soundtracks that came together with this documentary can be deemed as whimsical (from all fields imaginable) but some really rose to the ocassion namely the one by Beethoven.

872049,A16QODENBJVUI1,B0006Q93EM,Robert Moore,"[9, 9]","For the five years that I was in grad school at Yale I went almost every week to the Yale Center for British Art, which was the last design of Louis Kahn's to be built (the National Assembly in Dacca was completed after Kahn's death but was designed earlier).  It was difficult to see the building's exterior with any kind of scope, since other buildings surrounded it.  But I have rarely loved a building so much on the inside.  After entering the building you would ascend to the first floor through the monolith shown in the film (actually the casing of a spiral staircase) to confront two massive George Stubbs's canvasses.  That initial space was magical, not just because of the two extraordinary paintings, but because of the space and the way it welcomed so much light into it.  I used to love to go up to the section where the Turner's and Constable's were kept and lean on the railing and gaze about.So, I approached this film as someone who felt a debt of gratitude to Kahn like I've felt to no other architect except Louis Sullivan (for reasons I won't delve into here).  I felt that I had been a direct recipient of his largesse, so I was very interest to hear of Nathaniel Kahn's attempt to reconnect to his father.  I actually knew next to nothing of Kahn's life when I saw this film.  I knew of several of his buildings, including the National Assembly in Dacca, the Kimbell Art Museum in Fort Worth, and the Salk Institute, but I knew nothing of Kahn himself except that he died under bizarre circumstances and that he was an immigrant.The details of Kahn's life were quite astonishing.  The short version is that although he was married to the same woman for most of his adult life, he had children by two other women and maintained at least some connection to those children.  Though not a bigamist, he clearly maintained three families.  Nathaniel, the maker of the film, was his youngest child, and was eleven when Kahn's body was identified three days after being found dead in a bathroom in Grand Central Station in New York.  He was found to be a half million dollars in debt, so he was in effect bankrupt.  His architectural firm build a surprisingly small number of buildings, but as I. M. Pei noted in the film, what he lacked in quantity he made up for in quality, building a number of indisputable masterpieces.Nathaniel's yearning to connect with his father and to come to some kind of understanding of who he was and why he lived his life the way he did dominate the film.  Because he attempts to discover his father through his architecture, we get to know both Louis Kahn the artist as well as the man.  I was amazed at how much casual film footage there was of Kahn, film of him simply walking down a sidewalk with his coat flung casually over his shoulder, film of him doing utterly mundane and everyday things.  What emerges as Nathaniel interviews many of Kahn's former colleagues, friends, and lovers was a portrait of a man who was uncompromising (probably the source of his lack of success at attracting a large number of commissions), charismatic, likable, and a bit of a bastard.  He seems every inch the lovable rogue.  And also very much an enigma.  For instance, although a few knew that Nathaniel was Kahn's son, and although he certainly spent a fair amount of time visiting Nathaniel, many people close to Kahn did not know he had a son.  At one point in the film a relative of Kahn upon hearing that a man alleging to be Kahn's son was making a documentary of him, declared that Kahn had no son.  Nathaniel calls him and they meet and talk and he is clearly accepted as Louis's son, but it is strange that a couple of decades after Kahn's death they unaware of Nathaniel's existence.This is a film that is equally enjoyable as a study of the work of a truly great architect and as one man's search for father and family.  For me the most touching moment in the film may have been when the three children of Louis Kahn (by three different women) meet in a home he designed and discuss what it means to be a family.  They seem to agree that a family occurs when people decide to be family.  These three seem to affirm a bond between them created by a most perplexing father.",5,A moving recounting of a song attempting to reconnect with his father,1158451200,"09 17, 2006",2006,4221,"['five', 'years', 'was', 'grad', 'school', 'Yale', 'went', 'almost', 'week', 'Yale', 'Center', 'British', 'Art', 'was', 'last', 'design', 'Louis', 'Kahn', 'be', 'built', 'National', 'Assembly', 'Dacca', 'was', 'completed', 'Kahn', 'death', 'was', 'designed', 'earlier', 'was', 'difficult', 'see', 'building', 'exterior', 'kind', 'scope', 'other', 'buildings', 'surrounded', 'have', 'rarely', 'loved', 'building', 'so', 'much', 'inside', 'entering', 'building', 'would', 'ascend', 'first', 'floor', 'monolith', 'shown', 'film', 'actually', 'casing', 'spiral', 'staircase', 'confront', 'two', 'massive', 'George', 'Stubbs', 'canvasses', 'initial', 'space', 'was', 'magical', 'not', 'just', 'two', 'extraordinary', 'paintings', 'space', 'way', 'welcomed', 'so', 'much', 'light', 'used', 'love', 'go', 'up', 'section', 'where', 'Turner', 'Constable', 'were', 'kept', 'lean', 'railing', 'gaze', 'about.So', 'approached', 'film', 'someone', 'who', 'felt', 'debt', 'gratitude', 'Kahn', ""'ve"", 'felt', 'other', 'architect', 'Louis', 'Sullivan', 'reasons', 'wo', ""n't"", 'delve', 'here', 'felt', 'had', 'been', 'direct', 'recipient', 'largesse', 'was', 'very', 'interest', 'hear', 'Nathaniel', 'Kahn', 'attempt', 'reconnect', 'father', 'actually', 'knew', 'next', 'nothing', 'Kahn', 'life', 'when', 'saw', 'film', 'knew', 'several', 'buildings', 'including', 'National', 'Assembly', 'Dacca', 'Kimbell', 'Art', 'Museum', 'Fort', 'Worth', 'Salk', 'Institute', 'knew', 'nothing', 'Kahn', 'died', 'bizarre', 'circumstances', 'was', 'immigrant.The', 'details', 'Kahn', 'life', 'were', 'quite', 'astonishing', 'short', 'version', 'was', 'married', 'same', 'woman', 'most', 'adult', 'life', 'had', 'children', 'two', 'other', 'women', 'maintained', 'least', 'connection', 'children', 'not', 'bigamist', 'clearly', 'maintained', 'three', 'families', 'Nathaniel', 'maker', 'film', 'was', 'youngest', 'child', 'was', 'eleven', 'when', 'Kahn', 'body', 'was', 'identified', 'three', 'days', 'being', 'found', 'dead', 'bathroom', 'Grand', 'Central', 'Station', 'New', 'York', 'was', 'found', 'be', 'half', 'million', 'dollars', 'debt', 'was', 'effect', 'bankrupt', 'architectural', 'firm', 'build', 'surprisingly', 'small', 'number', 'buildings', 'I.', 'M.', 'Pei', 'noted', 'film', 'what', 'lacked', 'quantity', 'made', 'up', 'quality', 'building', 'number', 'indisputable', 'masterpieces.Nathaniel', 'yearning', 'connect', 'father', 'come', 'kind', 'understanding', 'who', 'was', 'why', 'lived', 'life', 'way', 'did', 'dominate', 'film', 'discover', 'father', 'architecture', 'get', 'know', 'Louis', 'Kahn', 'artist', 'as', 'well', 'man', 'was', 'amazed', 'how', 'much', 'casual', 'film', 'footage', 'was', 'Kahn', 'film', 'simply', 'walking', 'down', 'sidewalk', 'coat', 'flung', 'casually', 'shoulder', 'film', 'doing', 'utterly', 'mundane', 'everyday', 'things', 'What', 'Nathaniel', 'many', 'Kahn', 'former', 'colleagues', 'friends', 'lovers', 'was', 'portrait', 'man', 'who', 'was', 'uncompromising', 'probably', 'source', 'lack', 'success', 'attracting', 'large', 'number', 'commissions', 'charismatic', 'likable', 'bit', 'bastard', 'inch', 'lovable', 'rogue', 'also', 'very', 'much', 'enigma', 'instance', 'few', 'knew', 'Nathaniel', 'was', 'Kahn', 'son', 'certainly', 'spent', 'fair', 'amount', 'time', 'visiting', 'Nathaniel', 'many', 'people', 'close', 'Kahn', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'had', 'son', 'one', 'point', 'film', 'relative', 'Kahn', 'hearing', 'man', 'alleging', 'be', 'Kahn', 'son', 'was', 'making', 'documentary', 'declared', 'Kahn', 'had', 'son', 'Nathaniel', 'meet', 'talk', 'clearly', 'accepted', 'Louis', 'son', 'strange', 'couple', 'decades', 'Kahn', 'death', 'unaware', 'Nathaniel', 'existence.This', 'film', 'equally', 'enjoyable', 'study', 'work', 'truly', 'great', 'architect', 'one', 'man', 'search', 'father', 'family', 'most', 'touching', 'moment', 'film', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'when', 'three', 'children', 'Louis', 'Kahn', 'three', 'different', 'women', 'meet', 'home', 'designed', 'discuss', 'what', 'be', 'family', 'seem', 'agree', 'family', 'when', 'people', 'decide', 'be', 'family', 'three', 'seem', 'affirm', 'bond', 'created', 'most', 'perplexing', 'father']",N/A

Along the way, through interviews, old footage and photographs, much is revealed about this elusive, enigmatic, and often difficult man - including a closely guarded private life with children by three different women, while remaining married to only one of them.A personal film documenting the life and career of a public man, ""My Architect"" is wonderfully engaging, leaving the viewer with a complexity of emotions as we listen to the comments of those who admired him, those who loved him, and those who did neither. Especially revealing are the interviews with the two women, colleagues in his firm, who became romantically involved with him and years later still treasure the memory of him. An architect in Bangladesh sums up the final image of a man whose work was inspired by a kind of mystical genius and who gave his love to mankind.Moods mix and shift gracefully in the film from the discomfort of seeming to disagree with his mother's reverent estimation of the man to the sweeping effects of time-lapse photography and a whimsical scene of rollerblading around the great courtyard of the Salk Institute.

Little did I realize that I would be receiving much, much more than that.My Architect is an amazingly compelling story of a son's journey to discover more about the father he never really knew. As the film progressed, and drew me more and more into its fascinating discoveries, it reminded me so much of a real life Citizen Kane - A portrait of a prominent figure head, painted as indestructible, but just as human and fallible as those he seems to tower above.Interview after interview, director Nathaniel Kahn peered into tearful eyes as the interviewee explained how Louis Kahn, his father, had touched their lives. Kahn was portrayed  not only as an great architect, but as a friend, father, rival, cuckold, and savior depending on who Nathaniel happened to be talking to at the moment.How could a man of such influence and integrity in the workplace be so careless with the family aspect of his life? How did he manage to juggle three secret lives? What would he have done had he not died of a sudden heart attack in a train station? Where was he going? My Architect meditates on these questions in such a beautiful and poignant way, it is impossible to not be moved by the discoveries.Not simply an exploration of family conflicts, My Architect is also a poetic study of art as a political medium, as a career, and most importantly as a deeply spiritual journey.",4,Art as a spiritual journey...,1101945600,"12 2, 2004",2004,1492,"['walked', 'My', 'Architect', 'Son', 'Journey', 'expecting', 'solid', 'documentary', 'year', 'many', 'wonderful', 'documentary', 'releases', 'Little', 'did', 'realize', 'would', 'be', 'receiving', 'much', 'much', 'more', 'that.My', 'Architect', 'amazingly', 'compelling', 'story', 'son', 'journey', 'discover', 'more', 'father', 'never', 'really', 'knew', 'film', 'progressed', 'drew', 'more', 'more', 'fascinating', 'discoveries', 'reminded', 'so', 'much', 'real', 'life', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'portrait', 'prominent', 'figure', 'head', 'painted', 'indestructible', 'just', 'human', 'fallible', 'tower', 'above.Interview', 'interview', 'director', 'Nathaniel', 'Kahn', 'peered', 'tearful', 'eyes', 'interviewee', 'explained', 'how', 'Louis', 'Kahn', 'father', 'had', 'touched', 'lives', 'Kahn', 'was', 'portrayed', 'not', 'only', 'great', 'architect', 'friend', 'father', 'rival', 'cuckold', 'savior', 'depending', 'who', 'Nathaniel', 'happened', 'be', 'talking', 'moment.How', 'could', 'man', 'such', 'influence', 'integrity', 'workplace', 'be', 'so', 'careless', 'family', 'aspect', 'life', 'How', 'did', 'manage', 'juggle', 'three', 'secret', 'lives', 'What', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'had', 'not', 'died', 'sudden', 'heart', 'attack', 'train', 'station', 'Where', 'was', 'going', 'Architect', 'questions', 'such', 'beautiful', 'poignant', 'way', 'impossible', 'not', 'be', 'moved', 'discoveries.Not', 'simply', 'exploration', 'family', 'conflicts', 'Architect', 'also', 'poetic', 'study', 'art', 'political', 'medium', 'career', 'most', 'importantly', 'deeply', 'spiritual', 'journey']",N/A
