102492,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,0790734060,,"[0, 0]","This film is a masterpiece both of the cinema and of music. Mozart is the archetype of the composer and musician who transforms, every so often, the field of music by going beyond all canons and rules, or even regulations. He is the archetype of any creative person, in any field, who needs freedom to invent new vistas and perspectives, who needs tolerance and goodwill to be able to present to society what he is creating, to bring to the market and the public what he is inventing. Mozart is like a God of our western civilization.The film shows how, in his case, Mozart cannot dissociate his general provocative attitude from his creativity, how his best tunes, his best pieces of music come from the people he meets, the people he loves, the people who are hostile and try to crush him into death, and will eventually succeed by forcing him into composing his own Requiem.The first one in this line is his father who made him a genius and then treated him like a dog who has to obey all his finger-wagging and all his eye-frowning. The second is the Emepror who is both narrow-minded due to his vanity, and tolerant but not as much as necessary, just enough to sleep well at night. He tolerates an innovation and then kills it with a yawn that foretells about the peaceful night he is going to have. The third one is the official composer of the court who will do all he can to destroy this young man who is pushing him into oblivion and non-existence. He is jealous, angry, criminal, and he will dictate Mozart's death while being dictated the Requiem directly by Mozart from his deathbed. The fourth one is his mother in law who manipulates her daughter into going away with Mozart's son at the very moment when he needed both his wife and his son most.Then we could speak of the public who is manipulated into liking what is supposed to be liked and is decreed to be liked by the Emepror. This public is a caricature of taste and artistic feeling. Luckily there is another public, the popular public, who is responsive to innovation, to beauty, to entertainment, to anything that is new and changes their way of looking at things.But this film is also a phenomenal Requiem to Mozart who will be buried in a hemp-sack, in a common grave for the poor. The greatest genius in music, the greatest composer who has changed so many things in the tradition he was inheriting and has at the same time created modern music, is discarded by good society, is crushed by the status of pure slave that composers have to accept and free composers can't, is destroyed into death by a society that is not ready to accept that they will eventually die and that they must accept new forms of expression and expressivity for the sake of the next and coming generations. But have things fundamentally changed ? Some would say yes, some would say no.

I had reservation going in (often, when someone gushes about a movie, it never lives up to the hype).

What's fascinating about this film is the  fervered hatred this also-ran composer has for Mozart, which contrasts  sharply to his absolute love of the genius's talent and music.  Although I  doubt it is even close to being historically accurate, it is a great  fictional story and the music is wonderful.  Add to that, a worthy  oscar-winning performance by E.

102500,A25CZCHLNH3OMO,0790734060,,"[1, 22]","I watched this when I was about six years old, and all I remembered was the man with the blood on his hands at the beginning (my mother tuld me to turn around), the little boy dropping coins through his hands, and Mozart dictating music... and a few other minor things.Now, years later, my mother rented it and we watched it to see if we still liked it. It didn't seem as long this time - by that I mean it seemed really long but not as long as I remembered it.My impressions: I didn't appreciate the language and Mozart's crude sense of humour, nor did I appreciate Salieri's horrible, warped view of God. It was so pitiful and sad, and I could not feel for him at all. I didn't really go for many of the actors either. My favourites were the stuffy guy with the glasses and Mozart's dad - don't ask me why. Constanze was a loudmouthed, 1980's woman with modern values and attitude; Mozart looked like any teenager out on the street, just with a wig, and he sounded like them too. Aggravating.I felt some aspects of the movie had much potential. I think Salieri could have been portrayed as more evil than he was by merely toning down the narration and letting the camera tell the story. I thought Salieri's idea of haunting Mozart with his dad was cinematically superb, but something was missing, some vital link to make the torment real to ME, the watcher, not just Mozart.What else do I have to say... probably not much except that this movie did leave me feeling rather ""unsettled"" - I think I was hoping for more than it was, and a bit on edge the whole time because I never knew when Mozart was going to be rude again...I'm not even sure of the educational value of this film, since I can't recommend it to student-age folks, and I don't know how historically accurate it is anyway.

102501,A2Q07KQAAFWVL7,0790734060,,"[1, 2]","So says Antonio Salieri (F. Murray Abraham) of the word &quot;mediocrity.&quot; It is something that we all can relate to, myself included. First off, I never heard of Salieri. I never knew he had contributed to Mozart's death. I never heard of his music. These are the things we wonder and realize about this man. &quot;Amadeus&quot; is an epic biography about a man(i.e. Mozart), but is really a story of the man behind the name of Amadeus. It is also about the decline of the man called Salieri. It is a breath-takingly beautiful film filled with rich colors, costumes, sets, lighting (or the little bit of it, anyway) and the characters that make this an instant classic. Winner of 8 Academy Awards including Best Picture (produced by Saul Zaentz) of 1984, Director (Milos Forman), Adapted Screenplay (Peter Shaffer, from his Tony-award winning play), and Actor (Abraham, who beat out fellow nominee Tom Hulce as Mozart). The remaining cast also help a great deal: Simon Callow as the actor friend of Mozart; Jeffrey Jones is stimulating as the Emperor Joseph II; and the men who played the Emperor's advisors. The only spot on this film was the miscasting of it's two central characters. In my opinion, Tom Hulce was a rather silly Mozart. And not just Mozart's personality, but the accent. Exactly, there was no accent! Mozart was not American, he was Austrian. Second, Elizabeth Berridge as his wife was also dreadfully miscast. She sounded dry, boring, and out of place in all of her scenes. But despite those mistakes, the film is wonderful, exciting, moving, spiritual, uplifting, and depressing.

102503,A3K8POFWCQI2GS,0790734060,,"[3, 6]","Over 20 years after first seeing Amadeus, the only things I remembered vividly were Mozart's burial in a pauper's mass grave; the fact that the composer Salieri had been an envious, bitter enemy of Mozart; and the obscure detail that Mozart's wife had always affectionately called him ""Volfy.""  Mozart's personality, with his scatalogical sense of humor, had put me off the movie to a large extent on first viewing it.Lately, I came across an old VHS of Amadeus and decided to watch it again just to refresh my memory and to see if I'd have a different reaction to it now in 2011.  It turns out that I seem to have been through some changes such that I now like the movie and think it's great!  I still react against the vulgar aspects of Mozart's personality, but, at the same time, I can now overlook them or even laugh with him sometimes.  (Well, I also like that horse that he does.  And it's more merry than foul.)  I now feel affection for Mozart as portrayed in the movie, especially in the later part of his life.There are over 400 reviews here on Amazon.  I haven't read all of them but I'm sure there's little information I can add about the movie or about the technical quality of the various remakes of it, but I will offer a few personal responses.I can't refrain from seconding every reviewer who praises the movie visually.  It's a literally ""fantastic"" spectacle and apparently very authentic in its reproduction of the Viennese world of Mozart's day, notably in the theatre scenes.  The beauty of Mozart's music wonderfully permeates the scenic beauty of the story throughout, making this movie pleasurable to watch and especially to listen to.This time around, I found myself drawn above all into Mozart's deathbed scene which fascinated me for several reasons.  The process of music writing between Mozart and Salieri was very interesting, and I wondered if that would have been a true picture of how any music could have been written collaboratively.  Further, this scene contained an exchange that pulled on my heartstrings.  Moved by Salieri's apparent kindness, Mozart feels remorse for having cruelly mocked Salieri and apologizes to him quite sincerely, asking him to ""Forgive me.""  If only the plea for forgiveness might have reached its desired end and been accepted, and if only amends might have been made between the two enemies before it was too late.  But, the viewer knows that the kindly facade of Salieri is false, masking deceit.  No mutual amity can come about.  The truly penitent, guileless, and candid plea of forgiveness from Mozart is being offered to a confirmed Snake.  I felt sad for Mozart who received false friendship, but even more for Salieri, whose enmity remained so totally impervious to sweetness.Another poignant exchange occurs in this scene when Mozart tells Salieri about how to write the music for the ""Consigned to Flames of Woe"" and then the ""real Fire"" part of  the requiem.  Mozart asks, ""Do you believe in it?""  Salieri asks, ""What?""  Mozart replies, ""Fire that never dies, burning you forever?""  ""Oh Yes,"" replies Salieri emphatically.  ""Possible,"" concedes Mozart and immediately falls back into absorption in the all-consuming music!  Considering the enormity of Salieri's transgressions, his emphatic Yes is very ironic.  I find Mozart's greater interest in the Music than in Hell to be fairly delightful, but also seriously remiss given the gravity of the situation.  The exchange occurs in the few hours before Mozart will be consigned to the lime-strewn grave.  As Mozart directs his music but languishes mortally deeper into the ""Voca me"" section of the requiem, Constanza hurries homeward in response to the urgent feelings drawing her back to Vienna where she will have only a few moments with her dying husband, and Mozart will have only a last, smiling glimpse of his little son.  (I feel an ""Oh, Thank You"" to the story-maker for these parting blessings.)One of the religious themes of this largely religious story (or some might say irreligious) interested me most in my recent viewing of it.  There's a lot of attention given to the concept of God's ""favor"" and who deserves to get it.  The story is a first person narrative by Salieri as he makes his impenitent ""confession"" to a priest, telling him how he turned against God for not answering his prayers in which he bargained with God, asking to be made a musical genius.  He relates how he even burned his crucifix (a big one) and vowed to thwart the success of God's favor toward Mozart, whom he felt to be less deserving than himself.  The depth of Salieri's envy is murderous as Salieri carries out a plan to deliberately cause the death of Mozart by forcing him to write the requiem Mass for his father who holds exceptional psychological menace for Mozart, enough so that the process of writing the requiem will kill him.In the concluding scene of the movie, Salieri says that he speaks for all Mediocrities, and designates the priest a Mediocrity too. ""I am the patron saint of Mediocrities,"" he declares.  Salieri then goes forth in his wheelchair, blessing with the sign of the cross the insane residents in the mad-house hospital where he himself enjoys a special room, sweets for breakfast, and overall singular favor as a resident.  Over and above his blessings (of whatever variety), a disembodied echo of the loony laughter of Mozart rings out in the corridor of the asylum.  The way I interpret it, Mozart has the last word in the story, the last LAUGH, and it sounds, as always, so characteristically like an IDIOT'S laugh!Well, so, I think about the fact that God placed the genius gift of sublimely beautiful music---music that was ""the Voice of God""---in the mind of a man whose personality seemed irreverent and rudely, crudely earthy in demeanor.  There's irony, too, in the fact that Mozart's middle name, Amadeus, means ""He loves God.""  (And notice how the author has pointedly entitled his story AMADEUS.)  Bawdy and foul-minded though Mozart is reported to have been in real life, and although it seems unlikely in terms of this story that Mozart did consciously love God to a great extent, God inexplicably favored him with that gift of genius.  Nevertheless, there were other ways in which Mozart seemed less than blessed.  All mysterious gifts and circumstances to ponder.  Within the framework of this fictionalized and speculative history about the death of Mozart, I wouldn't venture to think about the fate of Salieri's soul, but I hope that Mozart's soul was somehow, in some way, eventually consigned to everlasting Music.",5,"The pleasure of his music, A classic to keep and re view",1303948800,"04 28, 2011",2011,6588,"['20', 'years', 'first', 'seeing', 'Amadeus',

It is one of those rare movies that is both frolicking fun and an epic classic.  How much of the movie is true or revisionism doesn't matter as much as how they use true elements to frame the enigma of Mozart's persona and genius.There are two stories really:  The main story is about Mozart (Tom Hulce), but it is told by an aged Solieri (F. Murray Abraham), Mozart's envious nemesis, at an asylum where a priest comes to hear his confession.  Bitter about life, Solieri rails against God Himself for feeling scorned by the eclipse of Mozart's talent.  Every time we leave the narrative into the flashbacks of Solieri's telling recount, we often are shattered as we come back to the cell with the sympathetic but perturbed priest--so absorbing is the story.  Amadeus is reckless and playful.  Having a wealthy father who scorns his son's frivolousness, Amadeus evaporates his monetary resources through wine, women, and song.  For the latter he only squanders through his venue.  For if he weren't such a serious composer and gave lessons, he wouldn't be in such a financial bind.  Considered an eccentric, he is, nevertheless, hired by the Emperor of Austria, to be a court composer in Vienna.  Solieri, an admirer of Mozart, has a big hand to play, for he is in charge of all the court music.  In the company of two other Italian composers, Solieri outnumbers and outpowers Amadeus in many ways.  Solieri has a plot by which he thinks by vanquishing Mozart, he will perversely reek revenge on God.'Amadeus' encompasses the genius of its subject matter.  With eight Oscars, including Best Picture and Best Actor for Abraham, it is one of the greatest films assembled.  The craftsmanship is marvelous.  Neville Mariner's score makes the whole experience worthwhile by itself.  Elizabeth Berridge's portrayal as Mozart's wife yields are sympathy, and Tom Hulce makes the whole affair an entertaining romp.  Even the priest frames our interest with his facial expressions, accentuating the audiences' horror and fascination.  Not to mention the scenery and costumes that have a splendour of their own.  After almost twenty-five years, 'Amadeus' is an untarnished jewel for the eyes, ears, and heart.",5,Confession of Brilliance,1172102400,"02 22, 2007",2007,2252,"['all-around', 'well-crafted', 'masterpiece', 'one', 'rare', 'movies', 'frolicking', 'fun', 'epic', 'classic', 'How', 'much', 'movie', 'true', 'revisionism', ""n't"", 'matter', 'as', 'much', 'how', 'use', 'true', 'elements', 'frame', 'enigma', 'Mozart', 'persona', 'are', 'two', 'stories', 'really', 'main', 'story', 'Mozart', 'Tom', 'Hulce', 'told', 'aged', 'Solieri', 'F.', 'Murray', 'Abraham', 'Mozart', 'envious', 'nemesis', 'asylum', 'where', 'priest', 'hear', 'confession', 'Bitter', 'life', 'Solieri', 'God', 'Himself', 'feeling', 'scorned', 'eclipse', 'Mozart', 'talent', 'Every', 'time', 'leave', 'narrative', 'flashbacks', 'Solieri', 'telling', 'recount', 'often', 'are', 'shattered', 'come', 'back', 'cell', 'sympathetic', 'perturbed', 'priest', 'so', 'absorbing', 'story', 'Amadeus', 'reckless', 'playful', 'Having', 'wealthy', 'father', 'who', 'son', 'frivolousness', 'Amadeus', 'monetary', 'resources', 'wine', 'women', 'song', 'latter', 'only', 'venue', 'were', ""n't"", 'such', 'serious', 'composer', 'gave', 'lessons', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'such', 'financial', 'bind', 'Considered', 'eccentric', 'nevertheless', 'hired', 'Emperor', 'Austria', 'be', 'court', 'composer', 'Vienna', 'Solieri', 'admirer', 'Mozart', 'big', 'hand', 'play', 'charge', 'court', 'music', 'company', 'two', 'other', 'Italian', 'composers', 'Solieri', 'outnumbers', 'outpowers', 'Amadeus', 'many', 'ways', 'Solieri', 'plot', 'vanquishing', 'Mozart', 'will', 'perversely', 'reek', 'revenge', 'God', 'genius', 'subject', 'matter', 'eight', 'Oscars', 'including', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Best', 'Actor', 'Abraham', 'one', 'greatest', 'films', 'assembled', 'craftsmanship', 'marvelous', 'Neville', 'Mariner', 'score', 'whole', 'experience', 'worthwhile', 'Elizabeth', 'Berridge', 'portrayal', 'Mozart', 'wife', 'yields', 'are', 'sympathy', 'Tom', 'Hulce', 'whole', 'affair', 'entertaining', 'romp', 'Even', 'priest', 'interest', 'facial', 'expressions', 'accentuating', 'audiences', 'horror', 'fascination', 'Not', 'mention', 'scenery', 'costumes', 'have', 'splendour', 'own', 'almost', 'twenty-five', 'years', 'untarnished', 'jewel', 'eyes', 'ears', 'heart']",N/A

Brilliant and delicate, with touches of dramatic human confabulation, along with a masterful dominion of the image and sound, convey is: truly, madly, humorous kinky, tenderly deeply. Released in 1984 and winner of 8 Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director (Milos Forman), and Best Actor (F. Murray Abraham), Amadeus belongs to the other kind of musical that doesn't uses the music to tell a story, instead it tells a story about Music, this time it happens to be the story of one of the highest enlightened Geniuses of all human history, Salzburg's precocious composer: Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (1756-1791).The truth of authenticity, the music behind the man, and the man behind the music. Based on play by Peter Shaffer, the story uncovers the mean intentions of Antonio Salieri (brilliantly performed by F. Murray Abraham), who awfully discovers that his long wanted godlike talent has been bestowed upon a buffoon not worthy of such a gift, he encounters a childlike man that is both vulgar and ordinary, this is Mozart (performed by Tom Hulce with great talent and deep Insight of the character). Salieri's jealousy quickly turns into a vengeance against God for denying him the touch of grace, he will harm God's creature, commending The Requiem (Unfinished), at Mozart's funeral, tribute to himself and his now hatred monotheism, kill him and be purified, AAAAAHHHHHH Salieri has been finally touched by God.A perfect transcendent screenplay, Milos Forman uncannily composes all the necessary elements in their right space and tone, the cast (perfectly chosen) become the faces of the factual historic characters (you'll never take apart Tom Hulce's face from the real Mozart), the already legendary performance by F. Murray Abraham, compels the virginal side of the purest love for music, along with the filthy tremors of the envious ways, Salieri is shown at is fullest human emotions, a magnificent reference work. Filmed in Prague, utilizing real historic locations of the life of Mozart, the film creates an atmosphere of music frenzy and soft repression of artistic creation, along with the exquisite costume design, and of course, a magnificent conduction of Mozart's music by Sir Neville Marriner (dissection by musical exposure), Amadeus is far more than a complete canvas of the genius creation, is a whole experience of tenderness and myth, and that unique quality of the best story telling that embraces the viewer towards smooth and touching glimpses of the human comedy, is ever cinema has praised a historic figure and despised another one with a sympathetic opinion, Amadeus is king, with a valuable lesson in vengeance; Victory!Even though Amadeus is an unlikely film for a Director's Cut, the new 20 minutes additional footage enriches the movie without hurting its pace, adding more splendor to the viewers eye (2001 New digitally transferred). The Making of, on disc two (over an hour of material), shows every aspect of the creation of this Masterpiece (the whole cast and crew was gathered for this documentary DVD), the simultaneous audio track by Milos Forman and writer Peter Shaffer is good (but lacking of consistency), anyway the new version is at the level of its feature (Also, a Limited Edition Collector's set, comes with a beautiful presentation of the film and a third disc), a great opportunity to watch again this jewel of Cinema History with all the enhanced visuals and audio to please you in your comfort at home (The first DVD version did have a great transferring of the movie, 5.1. Dolby Digital, an alternated audio track with only Mozart's music and some production notes, offered a great choice).Mozart was among the most versatile of all composers and wrote masterpieces in all the musical forms of his time: symphonies, concertos, chamber music, operas. All his music sings and conveys a felling of ease, grace, and spontaneity as well as balance, restraint, and proportion. Yet mysterious harmonies contrast with its lyricism, and it fuses elegance with power. Not only do his compositions sound effortless, they were created with miraculous ease and rapidity; for example, he completed his last three symphonies in only six weeks.Mozart died on December 5, 1791; five minutes before 1 am, After being blessed in front of the Crucifix Chapel of St. Stephen's, Mozart's body is buried in a common grave in the cemetery at St. Marx, leaving an immense legacy of inspiration and grandeur of the music composition, Amadeus is a consequence of that legacy, an extension into the visual / audio pattern of filmmaking, to inspire more with its beautiful romantic ideal of the life of the music genius, only the best, not meant for the uneducated ear.",5,"The ""Maestro"", with a Vengeance.",1067385600,"10 29, 2003",2003,4888,"['Behold', 'greatest', 'musical',

102510,A1A4DEENGHK51T,0790734060,Alan Attebery,"[7, 9]","Before I can start the actual review of this movie, there is one item I must first address: Many reviewers have taken this movie to task for its less-than-accurate portrayal of both Mozart and Salieri. While this is most likely true (I do not know all the facts, and, therefore, cannot completely comment on them), I am more interested in the movie itself than whether or not 100% of the facts are accurate. After all, Hollywood has never truly told a ""true story"" without some embellishment.With that out of the way, I can honestly say that ""Amadeus"" (Best Picture Oscar winner) is one of the best movies I have ever seen. It is also one of those rare movies that just get better and better with each viewing.""Amadeus"" tells three different stories during its 2 hours, 40 minutes run time (the Director's Cut has approximately another 20 minutes of footage). Normally, having this many different stories to tell would weigh a movie down. But in the hands of director Milos Forman (he directed the 1975 classic ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest""), this movie weaves each story into each other flawlessly.The first story is about Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (side note: when watching this movie, keep in mind that the name Amadeus means ""beloved of God""). Mozart was nothing less than a child prodigy when it came to music: he was composing full-scale operas by the time he was 6.But Mozart was more than a musical genius. Played with perfection by Tom Hulce (he won Italy's version of an Oscar for Best Foreign Actor for this film), Mozart was a vulgar, impish brat who love to play around as much as he loved to compose. Mozart's operas pushed the boundaries, and in most cases these operas are more appreciated today than they were in his time.The second story is about Antonio Salieri (played by F. Murray Abraham, who won a Best Actor Oscar for this movie), a fairly gifted composer who so longed to leave a lasting impression on the world with his music. He believed that God had given him this desire, and the first time he met Mozart he knew that God had not given him the gift to match the desire.Salieri would eventually become awed by, envious of, and jealous of Mozart all at the same time. Salieri never missed a single opera performance of Mozart's, simultaneously seething at and worshipping the musical genius. These conflicting feelings would eventually drive Salieri insane, splitting his mind in two. But this was a quiet insanity, which went unnoticed by all.The third story is about Salieri as an old man. Mozart has long been dead and buried, and Salieri, convinced he is to blame for Mozart's death, constantly cries out for Mozart to forgive him. The entire movie is shown through Salieri's ""confession"" to a priest. But it's not just forgiveness that Salieri wants. He also wants God to accept the blame for giving Salieri the desire to make beautiful music, but giving Mozart the ability to do so.F. Murray Abraham's portrayal of Salieri is perfectly understated and sublimely subtle. You can see the insanity take root and, eventually, take over Salieri, all from the tiniest movements in Abraham's face, eyes, and hands. You can see the music that Salieri sees in his head, and you can tell that Salieri has no way of releasing that music for the world to hear. There is no question that Abraham deserved the Best Actor Oscar for this movie.In addition to Hulce and Abraham, there is one more star that must be acknowledged: the music. All throughout the movie, various Mozart and Salieri scores can be heard. Unlike most movies where the music is background filler, these melodies are integral to the movie. At times, we see portions of various operas being performed. Other times the music we hear is what either Mozart or Salieri is hearing. The music was a perfect match throughout the entire movie.Early in 2002, a director's cut version was released to theaters, followed by a video and DVD release later in the year. Most ""Amadeus"" fans (and yes, there are quite a few of us) were a little put off by the R rating (the original version was rated PG). While the additional footage does help to clarify the hostility that Mozart's wife had towards Salieri, many fans felt that the nude scene that was added back in was unnecessary. To add insult to injury, the original version was no longer available on video. After much backlash, the original version of ""Amadeus"" was released on both VHS and DVD in early 2004.Although I have not seen the director's cut version, I think the original version is perfect as is. No nudity scene was ever necessary, even if it does help better explain the hostility noted above (personally, I believe the scene could have been done without the nudity).If you are going to buy or rent this movie (and I recommend you buy), get the original PG-rated movie first. You can always view the director's cut after that.",5,Rock Me Amadeus!,1101081600,"11 22, 2004",2004,4872,"['can', 'start', 'actual', 'review', 'movie', 'one', 'item', 'must', 'first', 'address',

Murray Abraham is marvelous portraying Salieri's pride and envy, and having to suffer the indignity of mediocrity; the part garnered him a Best Actor Oscar and a Golden Globe, among other awards, and as Mozart, Tom Hulce is stupendous, with his high pitched raucous giggle, fluffy wigs, and energetic appeal.Others in the cast of note are Elizabeth Berridge, excellent as Mozart's wife Constanza, and Roy Dotrice as his stern father Leopold.The biggest star of the film however, is the music...the glorious sounds of Mozart's operas, and his magnificent Requiem. Many of my favorite scenes are depicted, from the ballet music from &quot;The Marriage of Figaro&quot;, to &quot;Don Giovanni a cenar teco&quot;, as well as portions of &quot;The Marriage of Figaro&quot;, &quot;The Magic Flute&quot;, and much more.Some of the great voices heard are Samuel Ramey (Figaro), Richard Stilwell (Count Almaviva / Don Giovanni), June Anderson (Queen of the Night), Brian Kay (Papageno) and Gillian Fisher (Papagena), though the parts on screen are played by actors, and not those singing.Twyla Tharp's choreography is fresh and exhilarating, Miroslav Ondricek's cinematography is exquisite, and Milos Forman's direction imaginative and well paced.As well as Best Actor, the Academy bestowed Oscars for Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Picture, Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Art Direction/Set Decoration, Best Costume Design, Best Makeup, Best Sound, all well deserved.Total running time is 160 minutes.",5,"a mythical, fabulous portrait of genius",1090195200,"07 19, 2004",2004,1857,"['Peter', 'Shaffer', 'wrote', 'quot', 'Amadeus', 'quot', 'based', 'play', 'quirky', 'fanciful', 'vision', 'Mozart', 'Salieri', 'how', 'God', 'gave', 'Mozart', 'gift', 'musical', 'genius', 'character', 'flaws', 'bypassed', 'Salieri', 'who', 'tried', 'strike', 'deal', 'Almighty', 'vowing', 'pious', 'devotion', 'would', 'only', 'grant', 'brilliance', 'fame.F', 'Murray', 'Abraham', 'marvelous', 'portraying', 'Salieri', 'pride', 'envy', 'having', 'suffer', 'indignity', 'mediocrity', 'part', 'garnered', 'Best', 'Actor', 'Oscar', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'other', 'awards', 'Mozart', 'Tom', 'Hulce', 'stupendous', 'high', 'pitched', 'raucous', 'giggle', 'fluffy', 'wigs', 'energetic', 'appeal.Others', 'cast', 'note', 'are', 'Elizabeth', 'Berridge', 'excellent', 'Mozart', 'wife', 'Constanza', 'Roy', 'Dotrice', 'stern', 'father', 'Leopold.The', 'biggest', 'star', 'film', 'however', 'music', 'glorious', 'sounds', 'Mozart', 'operas', 'magnificent', 'Requiem', 'Many', 'favorite', 'scenes', 'are', 'depicted', 'ballet', 'music', 'quot', 'Marriage', 'Figaro', 'quot', 'quot', 'Don', 'Giovanni', 'cenar', 'teco', 'quot', 'as', 'well', 'portions', 'quot', 'Marriage', 'Figaro', 'quot', 'quot', 'Magic', 'Flute', 'quot', 'much', 'more.Some', 'great', 'voices', 'heard', 'are', 'Samuel', 'Ramey', 'Figaro', 'Richard', 'Stilwell', 'Count', 'Almaviva', '/', 'Don', 'Giovanni', 'June', 'Anderson', 'Queen', 'Night', 'Brian', 'Kay', 'Papageno', 'Gillian', 'Fisher', 'Papagena', 'parts', 'screen', 'are', 'played', 'actors', 'not', 'singing.Twyla', 'Tharp', 'choreography', 'fresh', 'exhilarating', 'Miroslav', 'Ondricek', 'cinematography', 'exquisite', 'Milos', 'Forman', 'direction', 'imaginative', 'well', 'paced.As', 'well', 'Best', 'Actor', 'Academy', 'bestowed', 'Oscars', 'Best', 'Adapted', 'Screenplay', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Best', 'Director', 'Best', 'Adapted', 'Screenplay', 'Best', 'Art', 'Direction/Set', 'Decoration', 'Best', 'Costume', 'Design', 'Best', 'Makeup', 'Best', 'Sound', 'all', 'well', 'deserved.Total', 'running', 'time', '160', 'minutes']",N/A
102512,A3Q77CS1DEQLMG,0790734060,Alessandro Bruno,"[3, 4]","Occasionally there are Oscar winning films that actually deserve all the honors bestowed upon them.  Amadeus is one such movie.  It's based on a play - same name - by Peter Shafer who adapted a famous short story by Alexander Pushkin called Mozart and Salieri.  Accordingly, the movie follows the short story's premise that Salieri was implicated in Mozart's untimely death.  There were real specualtions to this effect but there was never any evidence and, if we are to believe Beethoven who was his student, Salieri was a very kind man.  Therefore the movie's story is fictional.  Nonetheless, many feautures of the story are based on fact. W.A. Mozart's relationaship with his father had been difficult as were his dealings with the powerful people who commissioned his work.  Moreover, Mozart's music was appreciated after his death.  Beethoven was really the firts great musical star or artist in the modern sense.  Salieri's music was popular during his lifetime but the movie does a good job of showing how unpopular it would become later when compared to Mozart.  The movie is also excellent at using the music, which is not merely background but is featured as a star.Salieri's reminiscing of performance s and the cuts into the music are the movie's strongest technical feature.  But, visually the film also offers beautiful scenes from orgiastic parties with foods that made my mouth water to idyllic palace scenes - Schunbrunn Palce as Mozart performs his concerto no. 15 - to the utter pathos of the requiem composition and burial.I have seen this film over 10 times and still can't get enough of it.",5,The right number of notes,1007510400,"12 5, 2001",2001,1613,"['Occasionally', 'are', 'Oscar', 'winning', 'films', 'actually', 'deserve', 'honors', 'bestowed', 'Amadeus', 'one', 'such', 'movie', 'based', 'play', 'same', 'name', 'Peter', 'Shafer', 'who', 'adapted', 'famous', 'short', 'story', 'Alexander', 'Pushkin', 'called', 'Mozart', 'Salieri', 'Accordingly', 'movie', 'short', 'story', 'premise', 'Salieri', 'was', 'implicated', 'Mozart', 'untimely', 'death', 'were', 'real', 'specualtions', 'effect', 'was', 'never', 'evidence', 'are', 'believe', 'Beethoven', 'who', 'was', 'student', 'Salieri', 'was', 'very', 'kind', 'man', 'movie', 'story', 'fictional', 'Nonetheless', 'many', 'feautures', 'story', 'are', 'based', 'fact', 'W.A', 'Mozart', 'relationaship', 'father', 'had', 'been', 'difficult', 'were', 'dealings', 'powerful', 'people', 'who', 'commissioned', 'work', 'Moreover', 'Mozart', 'music', 'was', 'appreciated', 'death', 'Beethoven', 'was', 'really', 'firts', 'great', 'musical', 'star', 'artist', 'modern', 'sense', 'Salieri', 'music', 'was', 'popular', 'lifetime', 'movie', 'good', 'job', 'showing', 'how', 'unpopular', 'would', 'become', 'later', 'when', 'compared', 'Mozart', 'movie', 'also', 'excellent', 'using', 'music', 'not', 'merely', 'background', 'featured', 'star.Salieri', 'reminiscing', 'performance', 's', 'cuts', 'music', 'are', 'movie', 'strongest', 'technical', 'feature', 'visually', 'film', 'also', 'beautiful', 'scenes', 'orgiastic', 'parties', 'foods', 'made', 'mouth', 'water', 'idyllic', 'palace', 'scenes', 'Schunbrunn', 'Palce', 'Mozart', 'concerto', '15', 'utter', 'pathos', 'requiem', 'composition', 'burial.I', 'have', 'seen', 'film', '10', 'times', 'still', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'enough']",N/A

This is the incredible, mostly true story about the relationship between two composers in 18th century Vienna. Antonio Salieri, the successful court composer for Emperor Joseph of Austria, and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, a child prodigy who, while vulgar and irritating, writes the greatest music the world has ever heard. The film unfolds in a series of flashbacks, as Antonio Salieri is consumed with jealously by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's natural talent, and is unable to accept the knowledge that he will never possess the genius of a man he cannot stand. The film is presented in the Director's Cut, which features about 20 extra minutes of footage from the theatrical release.Cast: F.

Though many were serious, aloof, and square, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, perhaps more than any of his peers, embraced the role. He partied, spent frivolously, and died young under mysterious circumstances. 'Amadeus' may perpetuate the legends and myths that swirl about this musical icon, but Milos Forman's film adaptation celebrates the composer's genius so completely, anyone who sees this Oscar-winning work will take away one emotion above all others.Which is exactly what rival composer Antonio Salieri [F. Murray Abraham] feels when he first comes in contact with Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart [Tom Hulce] at the court of Austria's emperor, Joseph II [Jeffrey Jones]. Antonio Salieri's only dream is to create sublime music that will be revered by the masses both in his lifetime and well beyond, yet he's stymied by a limited talent and growing obsession with the ""giggly, dirty-minded creature"" who consistently eclipses him. That creature, of course, is Mozart, a self-confessed vulgar man, who's also a living conduit for some of the most beautiful music the world has yet heard. Finished symphonies reside in his ""noodle,"" and he effortlessly transcribes them without alteration or correction, almost, Salieri says, as if he's taking dictation.'Amadeus' is largely fictitious, but it cleverly takes seeds of truth and grows them into a compelling, substantive narrative. Both Mozart and especially Antonio Salieri are well-drawn, complex creations, and Peter Shaffer (who won a Tony Award for his play and an Oscar for his adapted screenplay) instils in them a multitude of conflicting qualities. We admire Mozart, but it's hard to like him; we can relate to Antonio Salieri, yet can't condone his reprehensible actions. What makes Antonio Salieri such a marvellous character is that despite all his ill will, it's impossible for him to temper his unabashed wonder over the perfection of Mozart's music. Sure, he takes glee in sabotaging Mozart, but he's also the composer's biggest fan. And tragically, the pure, simple beauty of Mozart's notes and phrases - music that elevates so many - plunges Salieri's soul into darkness.All the acting is terrific, especially Abraham as the tormented, conniving Antonio Salieri. His scenes as an elderly man recalling his relationship with Mozart and confessing his sins are riveting, and devoid of the affectations so many less talented performers employ when playing ""old."" Hulce captures Mozart's randy playfulness and sly conceit, as well as his sober sense of purpose and enslavement to music. His silly laugh becomes grating over time, but, of course, that's the point. As Mozart's commoner wife, Elizabeth Berridge is far better than I remembered her to be, and her no-nonsense, rough-around-the-edges personality nicely contrasts with the stuffy, fawning atmosphere of the emperor's court. (This director's cut more completely develops her relationship with Salieri, and adds more depth to her character and performance.) And in a small supporting role, a teenage Cynthia Nixon ['Sex and the City'] makes a notable splash as a naive servant girl Salieri hires to spy on the Mozarts.On its surface, 'Amadeus' may seem like a story of revenge and bitterness, but it's really about the transformative power of music, and how it can shape and twist fragile human psyches. It's a stirring, impeccably produced work and deserving of all the accolades it received.Blu-ray Video Quality - Though Warner's 1080p transfer is far from perfect, 'Amadeus' makes a fairly solid transition to Blu-ray, especially when one considers its age. Many scenes err on the soft side, but there's a healthy complement of sharp, well-defined images that burst forth with excellent contrast and vibrant colour. Unfortunately, I don't have a standard definition DVD on hand to run a side-by-side comparison, but it's tough to believe any previous incarnation of 'Amadeus' could look any better.Noticeable grain preserves the film-like feel and suits the period setting well, but never garners undue attention, even in dimly lit scenes. There's a lot of colour on display - reds are especially lustrous and rich - and the transfer handles the faint variances with ease. Though primaries shine, I was extremely impressed by the delicate pastel tones - powder blues, sea greens, and lavenders - all of which are exceptional. Many costumes flaunt intricate patterns and lots of adornment, but there's never any shimmering or breakup. Blacks possess appropriate depth (the tone really stands out in the gentlemen's jackets), shadow delineation is quite good, and fine details, such as wood grain and the weave of paper documents, can be striking. Close-ups aren't as crisp as those in new releases, but they're revealing enough to catch beads of sweat glistening on the brows of many actors, especially Tom Hulce. Stable, true flesh tones predominate, and Abraham's heavy makeup as the elderly Salieri looks, for the most part, very natural, even in high-definition.Some digital doctoring has been applied to spruce up the image, but it's subtle enough to keep critical characteristics intact. A few close-ups look a bit smooth, but the effects are never so blatant that I felt distressed or annoyed. Without question, 'Amadeus' has benefited enormously from this 1080p upgrade, but the image still can't rival the perfection of its subject's artistry.Blu-ray Audio Quality - The artistry of course is Mozart's glorious music. In the grand scheme of things, it doesn't really matter if dialogue is intelligible, surrounds kick in, or effects are distinct on this 5.1 Dolby TrueHD sound track; the music needs to be damn near perfect. Without proper dynamic range, tonal depth, and a broad sound field, the impact of Mozart's melodies on Antonio Salieri personally and the audience at large would not be nearly as great, and the story would suffer. Now, some may say Warner's penchant for 16-bit audio compromises Mozart's musical canon, but I can't imagine a better sonic treatment. From delicate strings to bombastic bursts of brass, from a soprano's trills to a robust basso aria, the track provides exceptionally pure, full-bodied tones with wonderful texture and shadings. Both symphonic and operatic sequences fill the room, immersing the listener in Mozart's playful, elegant, and passionate strains. Close your eyes and you'll swear you've been transported to a cavernous concert hall.During dramatic scenes, the audio is anchored up front, but noticeable separation enlivens the action, while subtle ambient effects occasionally grace the rears. Dialogue is very well prioritized, so we rarely miss a word of Shaffer's Oscar-winning adaptation, and details such as the palace's squeaky wood floors and the ruffling of the layered period clothing are all vividly rendered. Aside from a few potent rumbles during the Don Giovanni segment, the subwoofer is almost silent, but low end bass is gorgeous whenever the music dips into that register, and conversely, even the highest soprano notes resist distortion. Again, say what you will about 16-bit, but Warner deserves kudos for this one.Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:Audio Commentary: Director Forman and writer Shaffer settle in for a substantive three-hour chat that covers many topics. The two men obviously like and admire each other and create a comfortable rapport, and their lively banter keeps the track moving. Shaffer insists that even though the story itself is pure invention, ""there was a basis of truth in everything I did."" A Mozart scholar, Shaffer imparts a wealth of fascinating titbits about both composers that adds a great deal to the film; most notably, his belief that Mozart died of kidney failure brought on by ingesting too much mercury, which he used to ease the effects of syphilis. He says ""a piece of gossip led to a disputed truth"" that Salieri poisoned Mozart, and this controversial nugget inspired him to write the original play. Forman points out where deleted scenes have been reinserted and both men criticize a few of their own creative choices. This is an essential track for anyone whose interest has been piqued by the people, events, and subject matter of the film.The Making of Amadeus [Documentary] [61:00] This straightforward 2002 documentary won't stimulate the senses, but it still imparts plenty of interesting behind-the-scenes information. Refreshingly, all the major players in front of and behind the camera participate, and share anecdotes and memories about the production. Forman and Shaffer recall the intense collaboration that spawned the screenplay; all comment on the beauty of the Prague locations and the challenges of filming under a Communist regime; and Abraham recounts his daily four-hour stint in the makeup chair, as well as his detached relationship with Tom Hulce and the rest of the company. We also learn about the constricting costumes, the actors' musical training, and the arduous casting process that included auditions by such diverse stars as Mick Jagger, Sam Waterston, Elizabeth McGovern, Peter MacNicol, and Rebecca DeMornay. In one of the livelier segments, Elizabeth Berridge chronicles how she was brought on board at the eleventh hour after the original Constanze, Meg Tilly, withdrew on the eve of shooting due to a torn ligament. There's a bit of overlap between this documentary and the audio commentary, but not enough to prohibit one from experiencing either supplement.Original Theatrical Trailer [Standard Definition] [2:00]Special Compact Disc Compilation [57:00] An audio sampling of eight Mozart pieces from both the symphonic and operatic realms, performed by the Academy of St. Martin-in-the-Fields under the direction of Sir Neville Marriner, who supervised the music in the film. Liner notes connect each piece to its place in 'Amadeus,' as well as provide critical context and background. For those new to Mozart, this CD is a fine introduction, and should whet the appetite for further exploration.36-Page Production Booklet: Inside the DigiBook is a gorgeous 36 page colour booklet with pictures, drawings and information about the film.

102516,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,0790734060,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","`Amadeus' was one of the most refreshing spectacles I have had the pleasure of witnessing in quite some time.  I was personally blown away with what I was presented with and have thus concluded `Amadeus' to be one of the best motion pictures in the history of motion pictures.  If you have not had the privilege of witnessing this powerful film then please, stop everything you are doing and track this movie down, order it straight from this webpage if you need to, but please watch this movie immediately.  I don't think I've been this passionate about a single film since I saw `The Godfather' for the first time.  Truly all the praise and admiration that has been associated with this masterclass of a film is well warranted.  `Amadeus' is astounding from start to finish, a truly mesmerizing and utterly flawless production.  Milos Forman is God; seriously.As the film opens we meet Antonio Salieri, a man gone crazy.  He is living in an asylum and claims to have murdered Mozart.  In the opening scenes of the film Salieri is met by a priest who wants to hear his story and so Salieri proceeds to tell him how it was that he came to meet, grow to despise and eventually kill Mozart.Antonio Salieri was an aspiring composer who has reached a certain level of fame as court composer to Emperor Joseph II but he has achieved nothing in comparison to the fame and recognition as the esteemed Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.  Salieri himself feels that Mozart's music is divine, something sent from God above (kind of the way I feel about this movie) but when he has the chance to finally meet this messenger of God he is let down.  Mozart is not the noble gentlemen he had expected but instead is a pompous arrogant vile thing that sends shivers down Salieri's spine.How could God use this disgusting man in such a beautiful and miraculous way?It becomes apparent that the Emperor is smitten with Mozart's talent though and this bothers Salieri, not to mention others close to the Emperor.  Salieri then decides that he is to make it his life goal to destroy Mozart, to strip him of his power and social standing and ruin him, yes, kill him.  He concocts a plan all his own to accomplish this and sets it all in motion, waiting for the time to be right to strike and make his dreams come true.`Amadeus', as I mentioned earlier, is perfect.  I seriously cannot find a single flaw.  The script is deliciously absorbing and never loses the interest of its audience.  The direction is nothing short of phenomenal and the acting across the board is superb.  The two leads are brilliant.  F. Murray Abraham, who won the Oscar for his performance, captures the very dire frustration and conflicting emotions that drives Salieri to madness and Tom Hulce (who should have won the Oscar in my humble opinion) dominates as Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, completely fleshing out his talent as well as the demons that choked out the flame that was his life.  Elizabeth Berridge was sorely robbed of an Oscar nomination.  Her portrayal of Mozart's doting wife Constanze is brilliantly crafted and expertly executed.The only word I can use to describe this film is ecstasy; pure, unbridled ecstasy.  Since seeing this film I've thought of nothing else and have a feeling that I will think of nothing else for quite a while still to come.  Please, I beg of you, experience this film for yourself.

The Blu-Ray edition looked about the same as the theatrical release, at least as I remember it, which is to say it looked fabulous.  Enough has been said about the wonderful cast led by Tom Hulce and Murray Abraham, and about writer Peter Shaffer's substitute of a moral fiction for the actual history of Mozart and Salieri.  The moral is well-taken but it's the fantastic way Milos Forman assembles a picture of 18th century Vienna and the life of its theater and concert halls, creating an environment of music-making that is absolutely plausible and delightful to experience.  The Perils of Mozart story is, frankly, a bit silly, as is the somewhat painful contrast of Salieri's life and music with Mozart's.  It's good, however, for those who don't know the difference.  Mozart, like Charlie Parker, was an absolute original.  Like Parker, Mozart thoroughly enjoyed life, pushing his enjoyment of both art and party to the extent that he probably drank himself to death, or otherwise poisoned himself with too much of everything.

The film was a huge success when it was released in 1984. I would argue this is one of the greatest films ever made.The one star rating is for this, the Blu-ray release. Amadeus when released to DVD was issued as a double sided disc with poor video transfer that needed to be flipped. My hopes for a single sided disc with cleaned up picture were raised when the film was later issued in a &#34;director's cut&#34; DVD version which added 20 minutes of cut footage. When I saw the director's cut the beauty of the original film was destroyed by unnecessary and dreadful scenes. There will be those who enjoy seeing deleted scenes, myself included. However, Amadeus was honestly perfect in its theatrical version. I found the added footage slowed down the story, ruined how you viewed certain characters and detracted from the overall story of Salieri's narrative of guilt and jealousy. When I saw a BLu Ray release was available I hope that now we would get the theatrical cut, cleaned up picture on a single sided disc. Alas, no- only the director's cut.Blu-Ray technology holds so much more information so it is disappointing the studio did not include the theatrical cut giving viewers an option to this vastly inferior version of such a fantastic film.I have used quite a bit of hyperbole to express my disgust with this film but in this case it's accurate. 1 star release for a 5 star film.

It's the opera buffs and the Mozart experts who get annoyed by what they see as the liberties taken with the facts. Which is understandable, but didn't bother me at all. Nor did I worry about the various accents, which didn't seem to matter in the slightest. What this fascinating and extremely interesting movie vividly conveyed to me was something of the life of 18th century Vienna, as well as the beginnings of an understanding of the divinity in classical music. The sound was uplifting, in a way I never really experienced previously. The script was intelligent, the acting excellent. I thought Elizabeth Berridge was extremely endearing in her role as Mozart's wife, even though it may well not have matched the historical reality. It was obvious that many of the characters were, in a sense, caricatures: eg the Emperor, the Court musicians, even Mozart's father, and of course Tom Hulce himself. This really did not matter, either. Murray Abraham's face spoke volumes, and I thought his performance was superlative in the part, as written. One of the main themes of the story, and I thought it was very well explored and demonstrated, was the essential inequality of man: the simple fact is that all men are NOT created equal. This is a truth which Americans, especially and self-evidently, find difficult to accept. Another theme is the evil nature of bureaucracy, and the inevitably devious politics of the salaried employee. Stay in with the boss, and eliminate rivals --- that's the message. A third theme is man's longing for immortality. Why is it conferred on only a select few? It's also a partial truth that those whom the gods love die young.

102526,A108A421PC6MH3,0790734060,Bob Stout,"[12, 15]","After not having seen ""Amadeus"" for many years, I impulsively bought the director's cut edition which was on sale at the local wholesale club. It is everything I remember about it.First the good...The score is wonderful! As noted in the bonus materials, the music - all Mozart's and not adapted - actually becomes another character in the movie. It's glorious! Milos Forman also made the conscious decision to use a variety of Mozart's music and not just a few familiar pieces and it adds immeasurably to the enjoyment of the movie. Of course, the other can work well as well - e.g. ""Elvira Madigan"", where Mozart's 21st piano concerto became ""the Elvira Madigan theme"".The direction and cinematography are gorgeous and impeccable. This is a beautifully-crafted film which invokes a great sense of time and place.Now for the bad...The myth of Salieri's murder or attempted murder has been around since the time of Mozart. It's the sort of juicy story that just develops a life of its own, despite all evidence to the contrary. It's unfortunate that it has been perpetuated by so many - from Mozart's time to Pushkin to Shaffer.Mozart's portrayal as childish and vulgar is inaccurate. He had a sense of humor and fun. Sometimes his sense of humor was vulgar in interaction with those closest to him, but he certainly knew how to conduct himself as a professional in public. In the movie, he is depicted as both immoral and an alcoholic toward the end of his life. Affairs have been speculated, but almost anyone who draws public attention has to endure such speculation, true or not. In Mozart's case, there is no serious evidence to back up the gossip. Certainly, he was not a drunkard! Also, although he was certainly not wise in his handling of his financial affairs, he was just as surely not without students and lived quite comfortably for most of his adult life.Salieri's portrayal as a mediocre composer is also wrong. Salieri was certainly in the shadow of Mozart, but he was a talented composer of mostly operas (unlike Mozart, Salieri rarely composed instrumental music). Had Mozart not lived at the same time, Salieri would certainly have been better known, but then the same could be said of almost every contemporary composer. It's worth noting that Salieri's students included Beethoven and Liszt.Costanze's portrayal is closer to the truth, but still misses the mark. By all accounts, she was a devoted wife and Mozart was devoted to her. She certainly did not leave for ""the spa"" when he was sick. The backstory of her as the daughter of Mozart's landlady ignores the fact that she was the younger sister of a girl Mozart had wanted to marry when he and his mother were in Paris. The older sister eventually became famous as a prima donna and spurned him. Mozart remained in good terms with the family and was boarding with them in Vienna when he and Costantze developed into a couple. Leopold Mozart was opposed to the marriage mostly because the family had a reputation for what we would call a Bohemian lifestyle.Leopold Mozart's portrayal is more accurate, but then his isn't a fleshed-out character in the show. Leopold's relationship with his son was complex and, after the death of Mozart's mother, increasingly strained. The motives imputed to him by the script are not only wrong, but over-simplified.

The story of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart is fascinating,  incredibly re-made by the creative team of AMADEUS.  The real story behind the movie is the playwright himself,  Peter Shaffer,  who adapted his Tony Award Winning play into an incredible film.  It shows how brilliant he is.  The story centers around Antonio Salieri(a once successful composer and now a suicidal old man,  who tells his story from within a mental hospital,  a favorite spot for Milos Forman's films.  He believes he is responsible for Mozart's death,  so he recounts the tale of his longing to become a servant of God,  to write music and sing His praises.  Upon hearing Mozarts music,  he believes Mozarts work is the voice of God,  but once he sees that Mozart is a vulgar,  childish,  spoiled young man with an amazing gift,  he begins to think dreadful thoughts of how he can rid himself of this &quot;creature&quot; whom he detests.  This film won the 1985 Oscar for Best Picture,  along with seven  other Oscars including Best Director,  Best Adapted Screenplay,  Best Costume,  and most importantly,  Best Actor.  As Salieri,  F.  Murray Abraham is astounding.  His performance is a revelation of jealousy and wanting that never falters.  I must admit that it is a little sad that while Abraham was winning nearly every Best Actor award that year,  his fellow Oscar nominee playing Mozart had to settle for many nominations,  but no wins.  Tom Hulce,  I feel,  gives a performance of a lifetime as Mozart,  and rightfully deserves much praise for his fiery and passionate Mozart.  He is a brilliant actor. Elizabeth Barridge,  though at times displays too much of a childish acting style,  is the vision of Mozart's wife and acts as an excellent foil between the two composers. The supporting cast is excellent,  headed by the always wonderful Jeffrey Jones as the Emperor,  Christine Ebersole(Recently won 2001 Tony Award for Best Actress in 42nd Street),  Barbara Byrne(Original Cast Member of Into the Woods),  Roy Dotrice(Played opposite Zero Mostel in A Funny Thing Happened On the Way To the Forum),  and Simon Callow.

102531,A2E3F04ZK7FG66,0790734060,calvinnme,"[8, 10]","Prior to owning this director's cut, I had only seen the theatrical version. At the tender age of 26, when I still thought no film was complete without a car chase and a big explosion, Amadeus had me hooked. I went to see it multiple times back in 1984, back when the theatre was empty whenever it played and before it was nominated by the Academy.This film is an unusual biography, and I often like to compare it with Ed Wood, since both Ed Wood and Salieri were men who gave everything they had to their respective crafts and came up short. Salieri, a contemporary of Mozart, has only one dream - to be a great composer. Predating the prosperity gospel by about two hundred years, Salieri mistakes obsessing with God over his own earthly desires with actual godliness, even being happy when his father - who objects to Salieri's musical interests - chokes to death and leaves Salieri free to pursue his musical dreams. He chalks this up to God's will for his career. Problems begin when Salieri meets a twenty-something Mozart at the court of the Emperor in Vienna. Mozart is everything Salieri is not - profane, forward, and a great composer. Salieri starts down the road to insanity as he realizes the childish Mozart has all of the gifts he ever wanted and has been denied. However, Salieri is not an outright failure as was Ed Wood. In many ways he is something worse than a ridiculous failure - he is mediocre, and worse yet, he knows it.The director's cut adds some additional scenes that flesh out the motivations for the characters, and you would think that this adds to the film, but actually it detracts from it. I rather liked imagining what went on between the characters and having some of the sexual situations and conflicts insinuated and largely left up to the imagination of the viewer. This is all stripped away with the director's cut. Also, as unsavory a character as Salieri was, the extra scenes make him even more unlikable, and in a way that I thought was even beneath of what he was capable. I would elaborate, but I would give away key plot points.The commentary is the same as what was on the previous director's cut standard DVD, and to tell you the truth, the pair doing the commentary did not take the film seriously at all, which surprised me since one of the commenters is director Milos Forman. The comments were often completely distracting from the film's atmosphere, although they were well informed in their narrative. The other major extra, the ""Making Of"" documentary was quite enjoyable, and was also previously available on the standard DVD release of the director's cut.The cinematography and art direction on this film are outstanding. The visuals start out light and festive, matching Mozart's mood and prospects. As poverty, illness,  and the guilt of his father's death close in on Mozart during the second half of the film, the mood and visuals become very dark to match what is happening in Mozart's own life. I highly recommend the film, and if you never saw the theatrical cut I doubt you will be bothered by the added material of the director's cut.",5,Sometimes less is more,1263600000,"01 16, 2010",2010,3102,"['Prior', 'owning', 'director', 'cut', 'had', 'only', 'seen', 'theatrical', 'version', 'tender', 'age', '26', 'when', 'still', 'thought', 'film', 'was', 'complete', 'car', 'chase', 'big', 'explosion', 'Amadeus', 'had', 'hooked', 'went', 'see', 'multiple', 'times', 'back', '1984', 'back', 'when', 'theatre', 'was', 'empty', 'whenever', 'played', 'was', 'nominated', 'Academy.This', 'film', 'unusual', 'biography', 'often', 'compare', 'Ed', 'Wood', 'Ed', 'Wood', 'Salieri', 'were', 'men', 'who', 'gave', 'everything', 'had', 'respective', 'crafts', 'came', 'up', 'short', 'Salieri', 'contemporary', 'Mozart', 'only', 'one', 'dream', 'be', 'great', 'composer', 'Predating', 'prosperity', 'gospel', 'two', 'hundred', 'years', 'Salieri', 'obsessing', 'God', 'own', 'earthly', 'desires', 'actual', 'godliness', 'even', 'being', 'happy', 'when', 'father', 'who', 'Salieri', 'musical', 'interests', 'chokes', 'death', 'Salieri', 'free', 'pursue', 'musical', 'dreams', 'up', 'God', 'will', 'career', 'Problems', 'begin', 'when', 'Salieri', 'twenty-something', 'Mozart', 'court', 'Emperor', 'Vienna', 'Mozart', 'everything', 'Salieri', 'not', 'profane', 'forward', 'great', 'composer', 'Salieri', 'down', 'road', 'insanity', 'childish', 'Mozart', 'gifts', 'ever', 'wanted', 'been', 'denied', 'However', 'Salieri', 'not', 'outright', 'failure', 'was', 'Ed', 'Wood', 'many', 'ways', 'something', 'worse', 'ridiculous', 'failure', 'mediocre', 'worse', 'yet', 'it.The', 'director', 'cut', 'additional', 'scenes', 'flesh', 'out', 'motivations', 'characters', 'would', 'think', 'film', 'actually', 'rather', 'liked', 'imagining', 'what', 'went', 'characters', 'having', 'sexual', 'situations', 'conflicts', 'insinuated', 'largely', 'left', 'up', 'imagination', 'viewer', 'stripped', 'away', 'director', 'cut', 'Also', 'unsavory', 'character', 'Salieri', 'was', 'extra', 'scenes', 'make', 'even', 'more', 'unlikable', 'way', 'thought', 'was', 'even', 'beneath', 'what', 'was', 'capable', 'would', 'elaborate', 'would', 'give', 'away', 'key', 'plot', 'points.The', 'commentary', 'same', 'what', 'was', 'previous', 'director', 'cut', 'standard', 'DVD', 'tell', 'truth', 'pair', 'doing', 'commentary', 'did', 'not', 'take', 'film', 'seriously', 'surprised', 'one', 'commenters', 'director', 'Milos', 'Forman', 'comments', 'were', 'often', 'completely', 'distracting', 'film', 'atmosphere', 'were', 'well', 'informed', 'narrative', 'other', 'major', 'extra', 'Making', 'documentary', 'was', 'quite', 'enjoyable', 'was', 'also', 'previously', 'available', 'standard', 'DVD', 'release', 'director', 'cut.The', 'cinematography', 'art', 'direction', 'film', 'are', 'outstanding', 'visuals', 'start', 'out', 'light', 'festive', 'matching', 'Mozart', 'mood', 'prospects', 'poverty', 'illness', 'guilt', 'father', 'death', 'close', 'Mozart', 'second', 'half', 'film', 'mood', 'visuals', 'become', 'very', 'dark', 'match', 'what', 'happening', 'Mozart', 'own', 'life', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'never', 'saw', 'theatrical', 'cut', 'doubt', 'will', 'be', 'bothered', 'added', 'material', 'director', 'cut']",N/A

After seeing it nearly 15 years ago, it puzzled me as to why the film was titled after Mozart's middle name. This film isn't about Mozart, but rather of Salieri-an ambitious, envious and tortured soul who is a prominent but less celebrated composer in Mozarts' time. There is no rivalry-at least from Mozart's point of view, and Salieri understands that if he cannot be Mozart's equal, he will do everything in his power to bring him down. To Salieri, it is deeper than mere jealousy. It is an injustice for a cocky man such as Mozart to be so endowed with musical gifts while men, such as Salieri, struggle in vain to find one right note. His adversary is not Mozart, it is with God, and Salieri's secret, internal struggle to extinguish Mozart's talent, consumes his life. When I finally looked up the title to this film, I found ""Amadeus"" is Latin for ""loved by God,"" and it is a perfect summation to Salieri's inner conflict. This story isn't meant to be historically accurate, but the premise is interesting and the performances, like the music, are perfect. I've seen the director's cut and I think the additional footage is unnecessary. The original version was precisely edited, while the director's cut had this unfortunate effect of altering my perception of Salieri. The extra scenes made him more contemptible rather than someone we're supposed to pity. Despite the films' serious undertones, it has a lot of humor. Mozart was never described in my school textbooks as a giggly, farting, drunken mess, but it only adds to his unworthiness that Salieri condemns and seeks to destroy.

I saw the original cut in a Warner Bros. screening room before its public release in the early 80s (worked for them at the time) and enjoyed it a lot.  I don't know it well enough to recognize all of the material added in the this &#34;Director's Cut,&#34; but the entire film seem to flow far better than the original.  As I write, I taking a short break, about half way through the film and I've enjoyed ever minute so far.  The acting is superb, the settings and photography are world-class and the producers obviously went to great lengths to produce a musical track of extreme quality.  (I strongly suspect that the hired orchestra played entire works for later editing, rather than short clips of the many scores.  The quality of the playing is obvious and exceptionally good.)  Mr. Abraham's performance is underrated, simply because he is the bad guy; His work is exceptional.  The young fellow playing Mozart (I'm spacing his name at the moment) is outstanding and, I strongly suspect has some serious musical talent in his own right.  After watching multiple replays of many keyboard sequences, I have to believe that he played most of them himself.  Impressive.At 181 minutes, this edition is long, perhaps too long for theatrical distribution (roll those seats!!)  As leisurely home entertainment, this &#34;Director's Cut&#34; is well worth the time for a complete viewing.  My Thanks to Amazon for making it available via Prime; IMO, this is one of the best films in the Prime catalog and worth the time and investment.  In time, I'll probably watch this one again.If anyone knows...  I'd sure like to know where some of the interior scenes were filmed.I've given Five Stars a few times, but never with this degree of support.  Is Six available?  In fairness, a few detractors have noted a few inaccuracies about Mozart and his life.  So what?  Most views of this film are not musicologists, but folks seeking entertainment and just possibly some introduction to Mozart's music.  This film serves them well and yes, a flip-off to the snoots that note the minor errors.  This is entertainment and probably one of the top ten films that I've ever seen.

102537,A2H3TGP5WIJNHK,0790734060,"Center Man ""centerman@aol.com""","[7, 7]","This is not a straight biography.  Mozart's vulgarity and financial difficulties are exaggerated.  Haydn never appears.  Salieri was a better composer than ""Amadeus"" suggests (he enjoyed a revival during the 1990s).  ""Don Giovanni"" ran more than five performances, and was not a flop -- and anyway, five performances were a success in an era when the longest running play of all time was the ""The Beggar's Opera,"" with its epic 29 performances.There are other nits to pick, but they miss the point.  Mozart is the title character, but he's not the main character; in fact, he's a Deus Ex Machina for the story of court composer Antonio Salieri's struggle with God.  Having sacrificed everything -- country, leisure time and sex -- for music to glorify his Lord, Salieri is wounded to see a young, unhinged genius surpassing all competitors and barely breaking a sweat doing so.  Like a spurned lover, he questions God's justice, and determines to rob the deity of his voice on Earth.  The film explores the consequences of Salieri's actions -- for himself, for Mozart and for the muse they both served.This is an ambitious idea that could have easily descended into a simple revenge plot, but all involved keep their eyes on the higher drama. F. Murray Abraham, given the role of his life, captures Salieri's agony beautifully.  He's jealous of, and repulsed by, Mozart the man, but is completely in love with the music, and you can see both feelings written on his face as he attends Mozart's operas.  Tom Hulce as Mozart is a good counterpoint: He effectively creates a crude Mozart, an intentionally ahistorical representation.Forman's directing is excellent, and he deserved his best director Oscar.  It's a shame, though, that the added scenes in this director's cut intensify the focus on Mozart, which seem to reflect his subsequent films' glorification of outsiders than the artistic choices for this particular masterpiece. In ""Amadeus,"" where Mozart is a supporting character, his gradual alienation from the world serves the main plot beautifully. It also works in ""The People Vs. Larry Flynt,""  despite Forman's efforts to glorify the title character, because Flynt becomes the catalyst for a thoughtful meditation on free speech.  But when Forman celebrates eccentrics for the sake of being eccentric -- think ""Man on the Moon"" -- his films become little more than litanies of deeds, without an explanation of their importance or attempt to connect them to a larger theme.It's strange to say that the director's cut adds too many scenes with Mozart. But the extra footage gives us too much of the composer's relationship with Vienna, showing his rejection by court society and undermining Salieri's obsession (if Mozart is so unsuccessful, why is Salieri trying to destroy him?). And it distracts us from the fact that ""Amadeus"" is not about Amadeus.  It's about his rival.  Mozart's music gives the film beauty; Salieri's agony gives it power.

To borrow from the script, ""there are too many notes.""  We don't need to see a detailed chronicling of Mozart's self-destruction.  In fact, in the original, it seemed Salieri himself drove this downward spiral rather than simply being a contributing factor.  I see now that the original also had a kind of vagueness that enhanced the mysteriousness of the story and made it more dramatic and believable.  Especially since much of the detail can only be guessed at, leaving more to the imagination of the viewer helped avoid over-fictionalizing and over-explaining.  I think many film buffs automatically conclude that a director's cut is naturally superior, but that's not always the case.  As most people know, filmmaking is a collaborative effort, and while directors are usually considered the overriding force in the creation of a film, often the contributions of editors, producers and ""evil"" studio execs do have a positive impact on the final product.  (Directors are especially ""godlike"" in the U.S.  There's an old saying about whose role is most important: in France it's the playwright, in England it's the actor, in America it's the director.)Anyway, if this version had been released originally, I don't think it would've received as much acclaim or been as popular.  Like authors, directors need really good editors!  Like chefs, they need to cut out unnecessary fat from the meat of their story.  Otherwise, we're left with an unpalatable mass without much texture.  What's worse, though, is going back and adding a bunch of fat to an already exemplary meal.

102545,A1EOLRV216BXJ9,0790734060,Classic Movie watcher,"[10, 11]","The first time I saw Amadeus, I was totally sympathetic to Salieri (F. Murray Abraham) and felt towards Mozart practically the same as Salieri did. 15 years later I watched the movie again. As I allowed myself to perceive it more in the position of Mozart, I couldn't help swinging my vote to Mozart this time. The more so as the movie depicted how Mozart, deprived of wealth and success, was initially reluctant to take a mystery man's proposal - to work on Requiem. He simply could not face his own demons and revisit his guilt towards his father, plus he lacked the energy to finish such a grand project. But for that promised pay, he took Saleri's bait, forced himself to meet the impossible deadline and work until his last breath. The final hours of Mozart was brilliantly portrayed by Tom Hulce. The last scene where Mozart was thrown into an unmarked mass grave was devastating.The script was ingeniously written and tightly knit. The music score powerful and touching. The movie presented sympathetic and unbiased views of Salieri and Mozart at the same time. Coupled with fine performances of the two actors, the movie allowed the audience to see and judge for themselves. Abraham's brilliant portrayal of Salieri won him the Oscar - Salieri could not accept how Mozart, in a life style so different from his, could write such magnificent pieces.  Consumed with envy, he set out to block Mozart from any recognition of his talent. Even to this extreme, he was Mozart's admirer as much as Mozart's enemy till the end, secretly watching Mozart's play, the Magic Flute, and eagerly helping Mozart record his last notes for the Requiem.The movie inspires. One Chinese proverb about two competing talents with only one as the ultimate winner can be adapted to the movie: ""If Salieri is already born to this world, why bring Mozart also?"" - a remark made by the loser as to his misfortune to be a contemplary of the winner and thus the loser failed to make his own mark in history. It also supports the idea ""Who knows oneself better than one's deadliest enemy?"" The movie also reminds me of the biblical parable of Lazarus and the wealthy man. While Lazarus, unlike his wealthy neighbour, was poor and constantly starving in his few days on the earth, it was Lazarus who was in Abraham's bosom to enjoy a happy after life while his neigbour suffered down below. Thus set eyes not just on the present but on the eternal. So went Mozart and Salieri according to the fiction and the movie.A great movie!

Instead, the lavish adaptation of Peter Shaffer's play is a thrilling meditation on genius and jealousy, madness and mediocrity, anchored by an excellent cast and some of the world's greatest music.

102551,A8MVGWI5ZKNQ5,0790734060,Daisy Brambletoes,"[11, 15]","First of all, I want to put the issue of the so-called ""Director's Cut"" out of the way.  It should never have been made, even with the ease of being on only one disc instead of two.  The new scenes are annoying, the characters much less likable, the music is different, and though I certainly don't mind seeing more opera scenes (I adore Mozart opera), the annoying parts spoiled the whole.So I prefer to discuss only the original release of the film.This is not a biographical film about Mozart, but a tale told by a madman with the distorted memories and impressions of a madman.  And one truth in this film is that Antonio Salieri spent his last years in a madhouse.Very simply, this is a story of a ""Fan From Hell""; an 18th century celebrity stalker who rationalizes himself into justifying his crimes.  He adores Mozart because of his amazing musical gifts, and loathes him because somehow he fails to measure up to his own idealized visions of what great genius should be.  Mozart is not the godlike man Salieri wishes for, but a very ordinary and human. For Salieri, this is unbearable.  In his imagination, Mozart is an obnoxious, womanizing,irresponsible drunk, but even more unforgivably, has almost supernatural talent.When I first saw this film in 1984, I was incredibly moved by Mozart's story and his astounding music, and by the breathtaking scope of the film.  Over the years, I have come to see it from the more chilling viewpoint of watching a mad celebrity stalker destroying something unspeakably beautiful because he himself cannot have it.  There are chilling messages in this film, but in spite of the terrible tragedy of it all, Mozart still wins and literally gets the last laugh.The character of Salieri is repugnant while mozart, the victim, seems sad and weak.  Only Constanze, mistaken by Salieri as a brainless bimbette, is in fact the only person he is afraid of.  She is smart, strong, and loyal, and comes perilously close to discovering Salieri's true nature.  I loved her for her courage, and that comes close to the nature of the real Constanze, whatever may have been written about her to the contrary.But the heart of this film is the unforgettable music of Mozart, and that is what matters.

If you have any interest in classical music or movie epics then this should do the trick. However, I do agree with some of the other reviewers that the original theatrical release should also be part of the 2-disc special edition or blue-ray releases. This is mainly due to the scene of partial nudity that is in the ""director's cut"" which, at least to this reviewer, could have been left out or edited in such a manner that most of the scene could remain and there-by keep the movie suititable for all audiences. At least with a copy of the theatrical release that would not be a concern. I say this because this movie's music (Mozart's)is splended and is a good way for the young ones to become acquainted with that composer life and music. Of course I know a lot of the movie contains quite a bit of fabrication for dramatic reasons but the music and some of its history of composition/performance is true to historical fact. This is all brought out in the ""making of"" featurette contained in the 2-disc director's cut. I have a copy of both the original theatrical release and the 2-disc ""directors cut"" and I am happy with both and can at least tailor a ""movie night"" to the appropriate audience. This can't be done with the current 2-disc director's cut dvd and having the original theatrical release together would allow for just such a scenario.

102554,A31LHED3SKLWVB,0790734060,Darren,"[0, 0]","[This review is for those who've seen &#34;Amadeus&#34; at some point in the last 30 years.  While there's no &#34;ending&#34; to spoil -- we all know Mozart died young -- I do discuss the changes in the &#34;Director's Cut&#34; version, and I also discuss the themes of the movie, which &#34;spoils&#34; the movie for those who have never seen it.  If you're among that category, be warned.]Amazon is now offering Milos Forman's &#34;Director's Cut&#34; of &#34;Amadeus&#34; free on Prime.  If, like me, you haven't seen the movie in a number of years, it's very much worth watching again.  This version of the film adds about 20 minutes to the original theatrical release.  Fortunately, that's not too much more time for a comfortable home viewing; unfortunately, most of the material is filler that was sensibly cut the first time around.  Except for one scene: when Salieri coerces Mozart's wife Constanze into prostituting herself to him (Salieri, that is) in order for her husband to get the plum job as tutor to the Emperor's niece.  This scene solves some problems, and causes others: on the one hand, Constanze's overt and inexplicable hostility to Salieri at the end of the film is now made explicable; on the other hand, the sequence complicates our relationship to Salieri, whom we mostly pitied the first time around.  Now, we feel as if the suicidal old man that he finally becomes is merely his just reward for his perfidy.  We even see Salieri make accusations to the Emperor that Mozart is molesting his students.  Once these sequences occur in the film, our sympathies clearly shift to Mozart, whereas before, we viewed his sickly and lonely end with only a little pity, as if from a long cool distance.  In the theatrical version, we could at least understand Salieri's irritation with an apparently capricious God, even if we couldn't condone the destruction of another human being.  Now, we just feel sorry for that kid Mozart.Of course, the result is that the story becomes more soap opera than an inquiry into the nature of genius, and that can't be what writer Peter Shaffer intended, as he seems to more or less believe what Salieri believes: that God chooses to make silly punks like Mozart geniuses mostly for the purpose of humbling the pride of regular mortals like Salieri who are just bright enough to recognize the incarnation of such genius while also being deprived of the same.  Don't take my word for it: just watch Mozart compose throughout the film.  While his wife and father scream at each other in another room, he gently tosses a billiard ball back and forth on a table while drunkenly scribbling down &#34;The Marriage of Figaro&#34; in the manner that Salieri describes: &#34;as if taking dictation&#34;.  &#34;These are originals,&#34; Constanze tells Salieri, &#34;[Mozart] never makes copies.&#34;  And not one note was rewritten.  It all came out perfect.  While bedridden, Mozart dictates to Salieri the finishing touches of his Requiem Mass so rapidly that Salieri can't write it down fast enough.  I'm afraid I disagree with this notion of artistic genius, as if it's a lucky lottery number that the artist somehow has a ticket for.  Mind-boggling riches with no work.  As any music historian can tell you, Mozart endlessly refined his compositions.  Some publishers of Shakespeare feel as if they have to print two or even three versions of certain plays, in order to accurately reflect the different stages of his self-editing process.  X-rays reveal endless retouchings of famous paintings.  The cliche about 1% inspiration, 99% perspiration still holds, and &#34;God&#34; has very little do with it.  I wouldn't harp on this if Mozart's style of composition was merely Salieri's *opinion* and not presented as a *fact*, at least in terms of the story's universe.  But if Shaffer didn't believe that Mozart was &#34;lucky&#34;, then why does Mozart have such an easy time writing down masterpieces in this story?  Why would Shaffer even write the play at all?Well, even if I disagree vehemently with the movie's opinion, I was still very entertained by it.  How can one not be enthralled by this movie?  Forman managed to shoot his scenes of &#34;Don Giovanni&#34; in the Count Nostitz Theatre, the very boards on which the same opera was first performed two centuries earlier, and he did it in Iron Curtain Czechoslovakia.  The production design and costuming are stunningly accurate, transporting you to Mozart's time and place.  The opera performances are sumptuous and exciting -- perhaps too exciting in the case of the Seraglio piece, where I think Twyla Tharp's dancers seem a little more indebted to Bob Fosse than to 18th century Viennese ballet.  (But what do I know.)  I do wish that the movie wasn't so dependent on Mozart's operas to prove whatever point it was trying to make about God and Genius or whatever.  Thankfully, some of Mozart's serenades and concertos are in fact featured, some of my favorites too, like the &#34;Gran Partita&#34; when Salieri first encounters Mozart at the Archbishop's palace, and of course the sweet, almost simplistic, and yet ironic-sounding Piano Concerto No. 20 that closes out the picture -- to great effect, given F. Murray Abraham's wheelchair ride through the mental asylum, Mozart's ghostly cackle howling in his mind.  Almost never have image and sound synthesized so perfectly -- it's like chocolate and peanut butter.  Speaking of Abraham, his performance anchors the picture.  He has gotten plenty of work since 1984, but he's so completely Salieri here that he will be Salieri forever, and I truly hope he doesn't mind that!  Finally, the movie is rich with supporting actors like Jeffrey &#34;Well, there it is!&#34; Jones as the Emperor, Simon Callow as a vaudevillian who drags &#34;The Magic Flute&#34; out of Mozart, Charles Kay (wonderfully overacting, as always) as the court censor, and Patrick Hines as a blubbery Kapellmeister.  Tom Hulce and Elizabeth Berridge as the Mozarts use their young American-ness to their advantage as outsiders to the stuffy Viennese court.  Fun fact: a young Kenneth Branagh was seriously considered for the role of Mozart, until Forman decided he needed American actors to make the 3-hour movie about classical music more &#34;salable&#34; to American studios and audiences.5 out of 5.

102556,AIMGHPI1AGVRF,0790734060,Davewise,"[2, 2]","This film tells the very interesting story of how Antonio Salieri, the court composer in Vienna, tried to compete with Mozart. I stress ""tried"" because the film also makes it clear what a genius Mozart was - he started composing operas and symphonies before he was even a teenager, and when composing he did so without needing any corrections. Salieri was jealous of Mozart and appalled when he learned what a depraved man he was. Salieri himself pledged to God he would remain celibate if he was granted the ability to create music.The story is told through flashbacks by Salieri who is now an old man living in a mental hospital. F. Murray Abraham is wonderful as Salieri - showing his scheming as a younger man and his lasting jealousy and admiration of Mozart as an old man. Even Salieri admired and cherished Mozart's works. The movie contains a great selection of his works, used both as background music and in the foreground with scenes involving his operas performed on stage. Among other things, watching this movie reminded me I want to see another classical concert sometime soon; it even made me interested in going to see an opera.My favorite part of the movie was Mozart himself. Tom Hulce was dynamic in the role, conveying Mozart's zest for life, an abundance of passion for his work, and his deterioration toward the end. On the spur of the moment, Mozart was able to memorize and improve upon a small piece by Salieri which he heard only once. He fought against any minor changes to his own work because he considered it perfect as it was written. Mozart was rightfully proud of his work, but as a result of his pride and non-conformity, he found it difficult to make a living. Salieri, with the little power he did have, managed to make things even more difficult for Mozart by getting the performances of his operas limited to only a few. Salieri even uses Mozart's feelings of guilt after his father's passing to drive him crazy. While the end is tragic, the movie still left me delighted by the wonderful music and how full of life they made Mozart seem.",5,The entertaining yet tragic story of a genius,1302048000,"04 6, 2011",2011,2077,"['film', 'very', 'interesting', 'story', 'how', 'Antonio', 'Salieri', 'court', 'composer', 'Vienna', 'tried', 'compete', 'Mozart', 'stress', 'tried', 'film', 'also', 'clear', 'what', 'genius', 'Mozart', 'was', 'started', 'composing', 'operas', 'symphonies', 'was', 'even', 'teenager', 'when', 'composing', 'did', 'so', 'needing', 'corrections', 'Salieri', 'was', 'jealous', 'Mozart', 'appalled', 'when', 'learned', 'what', 'depraved', 'man', 'was', 'Salieri', 'pledged', 'God', 'would', 'remain', 'celibate', 'was', 'granted', 'ability', 'create', 'music.The', 'story', 'told', 'flashbacks', 'Salieri', 'who', 'now', 'old', 'man', 'living', 'mental', 'hospital', 'F.', 'Murray', 'Abraham', 'wonderful', 'Salieri', 'showing', 'scheming', 'younger', 'man', 'lasting', 'jealousy', 'admiration', 'Mozart', 'old', 'man', 'Even', 'Salieri', 'admired', 'cherished', 'Mozart', 'works', 'movie', 'great', 'selection', 'works', 'used', 'background', 'music', 'foreground', 'scenes', 'involving', 'operas', 'performed', 'stage', 'other', 'things', 'watching', 'movie', 'reminded', 'want', 'see', 'classical', 'concert', 'sometime', 'soon', 'even', 'made', 'interested', 'going', 'see', 'opera.My', 'favorite', 'part', 'movie', 'was', 'Mozart', 'Tom', 'Hulce', 'was', 'dynamic', 'role', 'conveying', 'Mozart', 'zest', 'life', 'abundance', 'passion', 'work', 'deterioration', 'end', 'spur', 'moment', 'Mozart', 'was', 'able', 'memorize', 'improve', 'small', 'piece', 'Salieri', 'heard', 'only', 'once', 'fought', 'minor', 'changes', 'own', 'work', 'considered', 'perfect', 'was', 'written', 'Mozart', 'was', 'rightfully', 'proud', 'work', 'result', 'pride', 'non-conformity', 'found', 'difficult', 'make', 'living', 'Salieri', 'little', 'power', 'did', 'have', 'managed', 'make', 'things', 'even', 'more', 'difficult', 'Mozart', 'getting', 'performances', 'operas', 'limited', 'only', 'few', 'Salieri', 'even', 'Mozart', 'feelings', 'guilt', 'father', 'passing', 'drive', 'crazy', 'end', 'tragic', 'movie', 'still', 'left', 'delighted', 'wonderful', 'music', 'how', 'full', 'life', 'made', 'Mozart', 'seem']",N/A

'Amadeus' seems to have originated from a letter in which he jokingly Latinised his first names, signing himself 'Wolfgangus Amadeus'.He died aged 35, and I don't think that despite the copious contemporary material about him anyone really knows what he died of. If I followed this film rightly, it seems to come close to suggesting that he died of drink, or at least that that had a lot to do with it. Whatever -- this film is not a documentary or a scholarly biography but an imaginative reconstruction. It is told in flashbacks by the dying Salieri, official court composer but jealous of his divinely-gifted young rival. There has long been a suspicion that Salieri had some hand in Mozart's early death, and there is even an opera by Rimsky-Korsakov, which alas I do not know despite being a considerable enthusiast for that composer, that has that suspicion as its theme. I have no view of my own regarding the real facts of the matter, because such scholarship as I have read on the subject has been of the worst kind, attempting to settle issues by criticism of the moral attributes and attitudes, real or supposed, of other scholars. I should just take this film's version of the story as creative licence, based on incomplete and uncertain information much as Hamlet is on the historical story of Amled.The main character is not Mozart himself but Salieri, played, in an imaginative piece of casting, by a Broadway and Shaftesbury Avenue actor F Murray Abraham. He is more or less beyond criticism, which is more likely to focus on the part of Mozart as done by Tom Hulce. Mozart is depicted as a crude little vulgarian with an excruciatingly awful laugh. He is shown as dominated by a possessive father, Leopold, hostile and bullying towards Mozart's wife Constanze. One of the most memorable vignettes in the film comes at a point where these two are at each other's throats and Mozart himself walks slowly out of the room looking as if he has seen a ghost -- the divine inspiration is suddenly on him.The story of this film does not point any moral, to my great relief. I was brought up on a great deal of sentimental gush about the supposely unspeakable tragedy of a great composer buried in a communal grave -- as if that would have mattered to him by then. One would expect better than such suburbanity from Forman, and in its way this seems to me a really first class piece of imaginative entertainment, helped of course in no small way by some -- shall we say -- rather above-average music. The main setting, in Prague, does not hurt either. One thing we do know about Mozart was that he greatly preferred Prague to Vienna, and who, I wonder, wouldn't? I would not want to give Amadeus anything less than a five-star rating for what it is, while not for one moment trying to suggest that what it is is anything remotely of the class of One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest from the same Director.",5,AMADE,1076284800,"02 9, 2004",2004,2955,"['So', 'far', 'know', 'was', 'actually', 'name', 'have', 'originated', 'letter', 'jokingly', 'Latinised', 'first', 'names', 'signing', ""'Wolfgangus"", ""Amadeus'.He"", 'died', 'aged', '35', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'copious', 'contemporary', 'material', 'anyone', 'really', 'what', 'died', 'followed', 'film', 'rightly', 'come', 'close', 'suggesting', 'died', 'drink', 'least', 'had', 'lot', 'do', 'film', 'not', 'documentary', 'scholarly', 'biography', 'imaginative', 'reconstruction', 'told', 'flashbacks', 'dying', 'Salieri', 'official', 'court', 'composer', 'jealous', 'divinely-gifted', 'young', 'rival', 'long', 'been', 'suspicion', 'Salieri', 'had', 'hand', 'Mozart', 'early', 'death', 'even', 'opera', 'Rimsky-Korsakov', 'alas', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'being', 'considerable', 'enthusiast', 'composer', 'suspicion', 'theme', 'have', 'view', 'own', 'regarding', 'real', 'facts', 'matter', 'such', 'scholarship', 'have', 'read', 'subject', 'been', 'worst', 'kind', 'attempting', 'settle', 'issues', 'criticism', 'moral', 'attributes', 'attitudes', 'real', 'supposed', 'other', 'scholars', 'should', 'just', 'take', 'film', 'version', 'story', 'creative', 'licence', 'based', 'incomplete', 'uncertain', 'information', 'much', 'Hamlet', 'historical', 'story', 'Amled.The', 'main', 'character', 'not', 'Mozart', 'Salieri', 'played', 'imaginative', 'piece', 'casting', 'Broadway', 'Shaftesbury', 'Avenue', 'actor', 'F', 'Murray', 'Abraham', 'more', 'less', 'criticism', 'more', 'likely', 'focus', 'part', 'Mozart', 'done', 'Tom', 'Hulce', 'Mozart', 'depicted', 'crude', 'little', 'vulgarian', 'excruciatingly', 'awful', 'laugh', 'shown', 'dominated', 'possessive', 'father', 'Leopold', 'hostile', 'bullying', 'towards', 'Mozart', 'wife', 'Constanze', 'One', 'most', 'memorable', 'vignettes', 'film', 'point', 'where', 'two', 'are', 'other', 'throats', 'Mozart', 'walks', 'slowly', 'room', 'looking', 'seen', 'ghost', 'divine', 'inspiration', 'suddenly', 'him.The', 'story', 'film', 'not', 'point', 'moral', 'great', 'relief', 'was', 'brought', 'up', 'great', 'deal', 'sentimental', 'gush', 'supposely', 'unspeakable', 'tragedy', 'great', 'composer', 'buried', 'communal', 'grave', 'would', 'have', 'mattered', 'then', 'One', 'would', 'expect', 'better', 'such', 'suburbanity', 'Forman', 'way', 'really', 'first', 'class', 'piece', 'imaginative', 'entertainment', 'helped', 'course', 'small', 'way', 'shall', 'say', 'rather', 'above-average', 'music', 'main', 'setting', 'Prague', 'not', 'hurt', 'either', 'One', 'thing', 'do', 'know', 'Mozart', 'was', 'greatly', 'preferred', 'Prague', 'Vienna', 'who', 'wonder', 'would', ""n't"", 'would', 'not', 'want', 'give', 'Amadeus', 'anything', 'less', 'five-star', 'rating', 'what', 'not', 'one', 'moment', 'trying', 'suggest', 'what', 'anything', 'remotely', 'class', 'One', 'Flew', 'Cuckoo', 'Nest', 'same', 'Director']",N/A

The great film, Amadeus, does not even try.  It presents Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (Tom Hulce) as a punk kid, with pink wigs and an annoying high pitch laugh, who comes to Vienna searching for work in music.It's obvious immediately to Salieri (F. Murray Abraham)that Mozart is a prodigy.  However, he is appalled to see what a brat he appears to be.  Consequently, he swears to bring Mozart to ruin.It's a fact that Salieri, later in life in an insane asylum, claimed to have murdered Mozart.  Historians are split on whether this claim has any merit.  The film, as I stated, does not take a side either way.The movie is great because the characters are so fresh and fun.  Mozart is a real hoot with his laugh and Salieri's intense hatred of him is obvious.  I also love Jeffrey Jones as the Emperor (remember his failed attempts to run down Ferris Bueller).No one will ever know what happened to Mozart.  This film shows us a reasonable guess at what his last 10 years were probably like.  The music is great, the acting superb, and the film was definitely deserving of its Best Film award.

It was one of those rare instances where the director had seemed to capture magic on film. So I went back and saw it again. And again, and again. Fourteen times in all, before it was pulled off the big screen and relegated to the awful, colorless, washed-out, pan-n-scan VHS tape we had to make due with for the next decade. Still I didn't mind. I watched that tape so many times, I finally wore it out. Something definitely went right with ""Amadeus"": the perfect blend of the best people in every department, from the best music ever composed, to the superb acting from all players, the great script, costuming, right down to craft service, I would imagine. Of course, when I heard the ""Director's Cut"" was out in theaters, I went immediately. I don't know what happened, but the print I saw was dirty and scratched, with several bad splices, and the sound was so loud, I had a splitting headache by the one-hour mark. Also, having seen the original cut so many times, I found the restored footage to be very jarring, and thought it interrupted the pacing. Needless to say, I only saw that cut once on the big screen. However, I just finished watching the new DVD, and I must say all my misgivings are gone. The clarity of the picture and the incredible soundtrack just blew me away. For some reason, the new inserts appear more seemless here (or maybe I knew when to expect them), and some of them actually improve the film. Constanze's character is allowed to develop in these added scenes, making her more sympathetic and more real. By contrast, Salieri is even more despicable than before. Several bits of dialogue tacked on to existing scenes could have been left out since they add little to the film aside from length, but adding the new footage does absolutely nothing to diminish the magic of this truly great film. It's got a couple really nice extras, too: a ""making of"" featurette, and a commentary track (which, if I'm not mistaken, is actually portions of the laser disc commentary with some new bits added--someone may prove me wrong on that, but I think I'm right.) And unlike the laser disc or the previous DVD, you don't have to flip it over in the middle! Believe me, don't bother renting this DVD; you'll want to own it. Anyone who hasn't seen Amadeus, and thinks that a three-hour drama about two composers from the eighteenth century might be boring, is in for a pleasant surprise when they see this DVD. At times hilarious, at others poignant, and always filled with the music of Mozart, this movie is fun and entertaining from start to finish, and looks, sounds, and feels brand new--surely not 18 years old.

102566,AOYTQFRLD8VLP,0790734060,Deborah Earle,"[2, 2]","&quot;Amadeus&quot; has been one of my all-time favorite films since High School. While the details of the film are not 100% historically accurate, I was always impressed by the fact that Elizabeth Berridge, Simon Callow, and Nicholas Kepros each bear a striking resemblance to contemporary illustrations of Constanze Weber Mozart, Emmanuel Schickaneder, and Archbishop Collorado. As for Tom Hulce's irascible Mozart, the blue-eyed brat among Emperor Joseph II's court composers, I still have the oil pastel drawing I did of him in a scene from the movie hanging in my house. I've always felt that he was cheated out of the Oscar for Best Actor of 1984. It's as if the Academy felt it would be too scandalous to let an &quot;Animal House &quot; alumni have an Oscar. In truth, Hulce's Mozart seems to be a carry-over of his role in &quot;Animal House&quot; at times. But he was absolutely brilliant in the part. In the more serious scenes as Mozart's career problems mount, and he first encounters the Man in Black (who, in reality, was a man in gray), his face resembles that of Ryan O'Neal's &quot;Barry Lyndon&quot;, another 18th century character, and I wonder if Milos Forman hired him for that reason. Roy Dotrice was solemn and dignified as the father who is no longer able to keep his child prodigy son or his career on track. In Jeffery Jones' first scenes as the Emperor Joseph, he resembled a one-dimensional painting; There was nothing one-dimensional about his performance, in which he could be very indecisive about the technicalities about music, but very firm on the issues of appropriate pieces for theatre. Some years ago, a revamped version of Peter Shaffer's stage play of &quot;Amadeus&quot; made its debut in the town where I live, and the play was definitely Salieri's show. In this film, F. Murray Abraham's Salieri, who, in reality probably didn't have a thing to do with Mozart's death, is a somber, embittered character, who could have had an easier life if he had confronted Mozart head-on about his shortcomings instead of scheming to destroy him. Elizabeth Berridge's Constanze is strong and supportive as Mozart's wife. She could hold her own against her husbands' unsavory cohorts when she had to, proving that the women of that era weren't always as passive as they may have seemed, although she still seemed overwhelmed by her husband's excessive behavior. A contemporary magazine review of &quot;Amadeus&quot; complained that the other Court composers were too subservient, but apparently, this is a realistic portrayal of the 18th century Austrian Court, and what American audiences tend to overlook is that people close enough to world leaders understand how difficult their jobs can be, and aren't as likely to contradict an Emperor on comparatively minor issues such as the theatre. In a smaller, less complex country like 18th century Austria certain forms of censorship, such as those advocated by Joseph II, may have been necessary to keep order. A pre-&quot;Sex and the City&quot; era Cynthia Nixon is a wide-eyed and frightened servant named Lorl, who witnesses the decline of the Great Composer, and is paid for her services by Salieri. The decline of Mozart is depicted with all the modern sensationalism of the demise of any young celebrity. We watch as Mozart's supporters either die or slip away, and as his impracticality with money affects his lifestyle, health, and his closest relationships. One wishes that there had been more understanding of child prodigies back then, and of their need for some normalcy in their lives, even though Mozart himself may not have been saved even by that. Ultimately, we see his life as a glorious, musical romp through a Rococo-decorated kaleidescope with a world of palaces and opera houses, the spreading of his music's popularity among the commoners of the land, and finally spiraling downward to an early and tragic death, which was poignantly, but not accurately portrayed in the movie. The final scenes of the Mozarts together tug at the heartstrings as the dying composer reconciles with his wife, and the funeral scene is devastating.

It was a career-making vehicle for F. Murray Abraham, who went on to win an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor in his role as the sadistic and insane Antonio Salieri, a jealous rival of the late, great Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (Tom Hulce).  This film is part fantasy (a fictionalized account of the life and untimely death of the title composer, through the eyes of the elderly Salieri, who has been confined to insane asylum (or maybe the better word is ""imprisoned,"" from his perspective), part musical tribute to some of the most well-known and beautifully written Mozart compositions.I won't go into too much detail about the plot.  That would easily ruin this film for you.  I will say that the acting is great, the music is gorgeous, there are moments of great humor, followed by high drama and the whole plot concept of this film is not so much crafted to romanticize Mozart as a man and an artist (far from it).  Instead, it examines the forces behind evil, jealousy and (ultimately) deception.  This is a very distinctive, evocative and compelling work of art.

I love the history of Mozart and this movie so enjoyably depicts his alleged flamboyant life and personality. The script is fun, the camera work is excellent, and the music obviously is fantastic which sounds great in 5.1.This movie was made in 1984 but has really stood the test of time. What a fun and exciting movie depicting the life of Mozart. Every minute of this film is fun and I can't say enough good things about it. I would highly recommend this movie whether you are a fan of classical music or not. It's a really entertaining family movie and if I ever have kids someday this is going to be one of the first movies they get to watch!I see some people ripping on the directors cut of this film. I have no problems with it whatsoever, to be honest, I can't remember too many differences between the regular and directors too much. Just a bit of warning with the directors cut, though. There is a scene where Constanze is topless (yes, nudity/full exposed breast). This was NOT in the original version as I recall, and as much as I like seeing a nice pair of breast, this scene definitely feels awkward in this film and out of place in an otherwise perfect movie. This scene also seems very controversial with the core fanbase of this film. If you are showing this movie to kids, you may want to be aware that this scene is in there. Otherwise, this movie is still excellent stuff and a great family movie.",5,Still a classic!,1395360000,"03 21, 2014",2014,1534,"['first', 'seen', 'movie', 'high', 'school', 'choir', 'class', 'six', 'years', 'ago', 'recently', 'rented', 'again', 'Amazon', 'love', 'history', 'Mozart', 'movie', 'so', 'enjoyably', 'alleged', 'flamboyant', 'life', 'personality', 'script', 'fun', 'camera', 'work', 'excellent', 'music', 'obviously', 'fantastic', 'great', '5.1.This', 'movie', 'was', 'made', '1984', 'really', 'stood', 'test', 'time', 'What', 'fun', 'exciting', 'movie', 'depicting', 'life', 'Mozart', 'Every', 'minute', 'film', 'fun', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'enough', 'good', 'things', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'movie', 'are', 'fan', 'classical', 'music', 'not', 'really', 'entertaining', 'family', 'movie', 'ever', 'have', 'kids', 'someday', 'going', 'be', 'one', 'first', 'movies', 'get', 'watch', 'see', 'people', 'ripping', 'directors', 'cut', 'film', 'have', 'problems', 'whatsoever', 'be', 'honest', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'too', 'many', 'differences', 'regular', 'directors', 'too', 'much', 'Just', 'bit', 'warning', 'directors', 'cut', 'though', 'scene', 'where', 'Constanze', 'topless', 'yes', 'nudity/full', 'exposed', 'breast', 'was', 'NOT', 'original', 'version', 'recall', 'as', 'much', 'like', 'seeing', 'nice', 'pair', 'breast', 'scene', 'definitely', 'awkward', 'film', 'place', 'otherwise', 'perfect', 'movie', 'scene', 'also', 'very', 'controversial', 'core', 'fanbase', 'film', 'are', 'showing', 'movie', 'kids', 'may', 'want', 'be', 'aware', 'scene', 'there', 'Otherwise', 'movie', 'still', 'excellent', 'stuff', 'great', 'family', 'movie']",N/A

With &quot;Amadeus,&quot; we're presented with a compelling, albeit inaccurate, portrayal of the maestro's life, and  the results are beautiful!The strength in any good movie always starts  with the acting, and &quot;Amadeus&quot; is well-equipped in that catagory.  F. Murray Abraham delivers a great performance as Mozart's envious  colleague, Antonio Salieri, while Tom Hulce hands us a memorable enactment  of the title character. Added to the mix are fine efforts by the supporting  cast, rounding out the presentation.Imagery is crucial in films of this  sort, and we are not disappointed in this area; cinematography is excellent  and art direction is fabulous.

(A movie about Mozart -- BORING!!) I have never been so quick to change my mind. From the opening moments, hearing F. Murray Abraham shout out the word &quot;MOZART&quot; I was hooked, and my eyes never waivered from the screen. I anxiously awaited the release of this Director's Cut, due primarly to the extras that were purported to be included. The extras more than deliver on their promise.Not only did I get the joy of watching once again one of the best movies to have ever been released -- to remember how enthralled I was by the performances of Tom Hulce, F. Murray Abraham and Elizabeth Berridge (unfortunately, most reviewers tend to exclude her contribution to this movie, but her performance as Constanza, Mozart's wife, is as powerful as the others) -- but the extras (behind the scenes, the commentaries) added to my delight.I truly find it hard to put into words how wonderful this movie is. I have spent the last 20 years telling people &quot;Trust me, just watch it, and you will understand what I am talking about.&quot; It is more than just a grand journey through the worlds of these two men (yes, granted, told from a &quot;movie&quot; point-of-view).

This may sound hypocrite coming from a guy who loves three-hour movies, but when there's nothing engaging in the material, 1.5 hours of dreck can be quite long.Amadeus is not such a movie. It is a historical drama done right. Despite its title, its main character is not Amadeus Mozart, but rather Salieri, contemporary composer and rival who has claimed to have murdered Mozart. The movie is not based on the real facts of the matter (we will probably never know, anyway), but on an interpretation of the facts. Amadeus is historically accurate, as far as it goes, even down to Mozart's annoying laugh, which was described by a contemporary as ""metal scraping glass"".Here, Salieri sees Mozart as God's incarnation on Earth - and since God has refused to give him the ultimate talent to sing his praises, and instead gave it to that vulgar iconoclast kid, he will do everything in his power, use all his wiles, to defeat and kill him.It is a story of religious delusion, yes, but clearly also about mediocrity. The mediocre always seek to enslave the successful, be it in politics (suffice it to see the success of social programs and socialization of vital institutions) or otherwise. Salieri suffers : he is good enough to know that Mozart is an absolute genius, but cannot be elevated to his level.For sure, the sets are sumptuous, and the acting right on the note. The accents are distracting, the acting can be slightly overbearing, and the music is overwhelming at times.

Mozart died very young and wasn't fully and deservedly appreciated and hailed as one of the greatest geniuses in human history until after his death; there was a musician named Antonio Salieri at the Emperor's court, but his relationship with Mozart wasn't that close. And hey, he may seem a mediocre composer when compared to Mozart, but he's actually written some excellent operas and certainly deserves much more credit than he gets now.

Murray Abraham, who won the Oscar Best Actor, beating out his fellow actor Tom Hulce, who portrayed the man who was ""Beloved Of God."") The brief bits of opera which were shown were staged very well by the legendary Twyla Tharp (especially ""Don Giovanni""). For that and the utter beauty and timelessness music of the Master itself, I give it three stars. I withold the fourth and fifth stars because of some HUGE historical inaccuracies AND the unneccessary nude scene (inserted for the Director's Cut). I shall begin.I. I have read several biographies of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, including one by Victor Seroff, and NEVER did I read of Mozart cheating on Constanze (as is implied in the film) or vice versa. If Mozart had done such a thing, his wife would have left him and, as far as I know, she did not desert him for another man (she married again after his death after waiting the decent interval).II. Constanze and Mozart had six children, of which only two survived to adulthood (but they never produced children of their own). In the film, only one child is depicted (I'm not sure which, as he is never named in the damn picture). Serious blunder.III. Constanze NEVER destroyed any of Mozart's work; in fact, she published them herself, recognizing her husband's God-given gift to write sublime music.IV. Mozart was a vulgar man, as shown, but he ""Spoke a crude or coarse word"" to Constanze, as the movie clearly shows.V. The scene where Constanze undresses in front of Salieri was unneccessary and NOT TRUE. Constanze loved Mozart with all her heart and would NEVER have done such an atrocious thing.VI. Mozasrt DID NOT die in the morning. He died on the night of December 4, 1791. That morning, he gave his pupil (somehow, the movie skipped the fact that he HAD pupils) Franz Sussmayr instructions for the completion of the ""Requiem Mass"" and that night, the great Mozart died. According to a photograph I saw (and the biography I mentioned earlier in my first point), he died surrounded by his family. He was given a pauper's funeral because HIS FAMILY WAS POOR, NOT because a noble (Baron Von Sweiten, in the play and movie; they omitted his line for the funeral from the script for the movie) sugessted that it was ""Vain Show.""VII. Why the devil would Salieri want to help Mozart, if his ultimate aim was to destroy him ""By any means neccessary""? THERE IS NO PROOF OF THAT!! Please see my previous point for more information on this.VIII. Mozart briefly taught the young Ludwig Von Beethoven (1770-1827) and immediately recognized his genius. Another HUGE error in not depicting this fact.Excellent period piece, but I DO NOT recommend it as a history lesson. The nude scene, as I stated earlier, was unneccessary and has no basis in actual fact.

It soars above the retelling of a wonderous life, presenting to us a mosiac of deep meaning, wonderful performances, sensational music, and one of the best movies ever made.Tom Hulce and F. Murray Abrams take control of this movie the first time they appear in it, and refuse to let it go. Whereas the power in their lives rests in the monarchy, they are the true power of this film as they dance and weave around each other. Salieri, a now forgotten composer, apparently once revered in his time, secretly adores and publicly abhors Mozart, gifted prodigy.  By giving us some creative if not accurate context for Mozart's music, we see the true brilliance of his greatness, by comparing and listening to his music through Salieri's simple ears.  The finest moment of the film perhaps comes at the ending, with Salieri, an old and feeble man, realizing that his life has added up to nothing but mediocrity and meagerness. As he's wheeled through the halls of the sanitorium, he blesses the crazy and insane, reveling in the pain of the irony his life has become. Incredible.As mentioned, Hulce and Abrams both soar in their roles; each embody the true spirits of their characters, there is not a moment's doubt or hesitation in their performances.  Their acting is so perfect, so refined, it is not acting, it is being. On the screen, the real Salieri and Mozart are before you. No finer gift can an actor give to his craft.And no finer film can a group of professionals give the world. Amadeus is all about brilliance at the same time being all about mediocrity. This duality drives the tension and the drama, making the film so wonderfully complex and deep. I never tire of watching this, each time finding a new glimmer previously not realized.It is well worth your time, if you have not yet done it, to settle down and allow &quot;Amadeus&quot; to soak over you, and prepare to marvel.",5,The Extraordinary among the Mediocrity,1038009600,"11 23, 2002",2002,2033,"['Certainly', 'fantasia', 'life', 'one', 'world', 'greatest', 'composers', 'quot', 'Amadeus', 'quot', 'more', 'much', 'more', 'merely', 'dreamed', 'biography', 'retelling', 'wonderous', 'life', 'presenting', 'mosiac', 'deep', 'meaning', 'wonderful', 'performances', 'sensational', 'music', 'one', 'best', 'movies', 'ever', 'made.Tom', 'Hulce', 'F.', 'Murray', 'Abrams', 'take', 'control', 'movie', 'first', 'time', 'appear', 'refuse', 'let', 'go', 'power', 'lives', 'rests', 'monarchy', 'are', 'true', 'power', 'film', 'dance', 'weave', 'other', 'Salieri', 'now', 'forgotten', 'composer', 'apparently', 'once', 'revered', 'time', 'secretly', 'publicly', 'abhors', 'Mozart', 'gifted', 'prodigy', 'giving', 'creative', 'not', 'accurate', 'context', 'Mozart', 'music', 'see', 'true', 'brilliance', 'greatness', 'comparing', 'listening', 'music', 'Salieri', 'simple', 'ears', 'finest', 'moment', 'film', 'perhaps', 'ending', 'Salieri', 'old', 'feeble', 'man', 'realizing', 'life', 'added', 'up', 'nothing', 'mediocrity', 'meagerness', 'wheeled', 'halls', 'sanitorium', 'crazy', 'insane', 'reveling', 'pain', 'irony', 'life', 'become', 'Incredible.As', 'mentioned', 'Hulce', 'Abrams', 'soar', 'roles', 'embody', 'true', 'spirits', 'characters', 'not', 'moment', 'doubt', 'hesitation', 'performances', 'acting', 'so', 'perfect', 'so', 'refined', 'not', 'acting', 'being', 'screen', 'real', 'Salieri', 'Mozart', 'are', 'finer', 'gift', 'can', 'actor', 'give', 'craft.And', 'finer', 'film', 'can', 'group', 'professionals', 'give', 'world', 'Amadeus', 'brilliance', 'same', 'time', 'being', 'mediocrity', 'duality', 'tension', 'drama', 'making', 'film', 'so', 'wonderfully', 'complex', 'deep', 'never', 'tire', 'watching', 'time', 'finding', 'new', 'glimmer', 'previously', 'not', 'realized.It', 'well', 'time', 'have', 'not', 'yet', 'done', 'settle', 'down', 'allow', 'quot', 'Amadeus', 'quot', 'soak', 'prepare', 'marvel']",N/A

I bought it in 2005.One of the discs contain the movie (it has both the director's cut and the theatrical versions) and the other one is the special features (interviews etc).Then I saw the movie in Blu-Ray.I read the reviews because I was sceptical about the video quality of the blu-ray. Is it worth it? -Yes (read below).All the reviews are mixed up. I even saw some reviews about laser disc and VHS releases.Well, I want to tell you about the Blu-Ray.Yes it's worth to pay for the Blu-Ray version.I watched both discs (DVD and Blu-Ray) and compared them almost simultaneously in 2 different Blu-Ray players (one being OPPO BD93, the other is Panasonic something). Both players one by one proved that Blu-Ray has a better picture quality than the DVD.Sound didn't seem to differ a lot though.

Harris ""The Voice of Reason""","[160, 174]","I've purchased every disc release of this movie:  the expensive LaserDisc collector's set, the original DVD release and the subsquent Director's Cut, and this new Blu-Ray of the Director's Cut.  The Blu-Ray release stands head and shoulders above the rest for picture quality, color, and sound.My only gripe is that the original theatrical cut is not available on Blu-Ray as a separate item or as an alternative viewing option on the Director's Cut.  The theatrical cut is the one that most of us saw first and saw over and over again over the course of some 20 years before the Director's Cut was released on DVD.The additional footage in the Director's Cut is interesting but, to me at least, seems intrusive.  It interrupts the flow and tempo I am used to.  There is also a brief scene of female nudity that seems a bit gratuitous.  The scene does, though,  lend some weight to a scene later in the film where you see Constanze's open hostility toward Salieri.  Normally I'm not one to complain about a little female flesh being exposed, but I think the film works well enough without it.Other ""new"" scenes follow pretty much the same description:  they are interesting but their necessity is debatable.There is one small addition that I did enjoy, though.  Early in the film, during one of the scenes where the elderly Salieri is confessing (?) to the young priest, Salieri is recounting the episode when he first met the young composer Mozart he'd heard about for so many years.  He was blown away by his talent but outraged and offended by his peurile behavior.  He insisted to the priest that such talent (evident in one composition in particular) could not and should not exist in such a vile and vulgar child.  That brilliant composition simply HAD to be an accident!  Salieri's lines are briefly extended in that moment, and it adds a wonderful touch of menace.  I can't understand why it was cut from the original release.The LaserDisc release included a wonderful behind-the-scenes documentary called ""The Last Laugh"".  So far I haven't seen it included in any DVD or Blu-Ray release.  I'm holding on to my LaserDisc player for precisely that reason.  Add that documentary to this Blu-Ray release and you have a slam-dunk 5-star product.Depending on the release version, this Blu-Ray movie may come in book form and include a short bonus CD of some music from the film and a picture booklet.  If you bought/buy the version that comes with the bonus Digital Copy of the film (available at some retailers but harder to find online), bear in mind that the Digital Copy is NOT compatible with iTunes and cannot be loaded to your iPod.  There is no wording on the package to indicate this.  One has to open the Digital Copy booklet to find that out.  The Digital Copy booklet looks the same on the outside as the booklet for the Digital Copies of other movies that ARE compatible with iTunes, so a consumer who has purchased iTunes-compatible Digital Copy-included DVDs before could reasonably assume this one would be compatible also.  That consumer would be wrong. Nice bait-and-switch, don't you think?If you got the non-book version of the Blu-Ray, it probably didn't come with the bonus CD, booklet, or Digital Copy.",4,"Gorgeous Director's Cut transfer.

102616,A34D06JL7LC6MU,0790734060,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[2, 2]","Milos Forman's ""Amadeus"" is the fictional story of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and his bitter rival Antonio Salieri. The movie swept the Academy Award ceremony the year of its release, winning Best Picture, Best Actor (F. Murray Abraham), Best Director, and five others and it holds a place on The American Film Institute's Top 100 List (#53). This is odd for a movie about classical music that features a lot of opera singing in it. For me, the most appealing thing about the film is the two lead performances. F. Murray Abraham (as Salieri) and Tom Hulce (as Mozart). Throughout the film, Salieri is a sympathetic character despite the fact that he's a jealous, only quasi-talented man jealous of someone else's gifts. Meanwhile, Mozart is the character we should feel for and yet, throughout the whole movie (until the end), we want to kick him in the face. The movie opens many years after Mozart has died and Salieri, a once great composer, tries to commit suicide claiming he killed Mozart. The rest of the film is a flashback, as Salieri tells a priest the story. A story about how he longed for greatness and then saw the most brilliant musician of all time in the form of Mozart, a young man with an obnoxious personality and an annoying laugh. Salieri is jealous that these great gifts have been bestowed on such an immature person, he begins plotting to kill Mozart...But not until he's acquired some of the man's final writings. Anyway, enough with the synopsis because I'm pretty sure you've already heard it anyway. The movie is, obviously, a period piece and it does have lavish costumes and people writing with feathers. I know a good many people who won't watch a movie for those reasons, but ""Amadeus"" feels extraordinarily modern. Forman, a Czechoslovakian director who made films there and then came to America to great success, is a great director and this film is one of his greatest triumphs. It's funny, has great dialogue, and the performances are (once again) DYNAMITE! Even though Abraham won the Academy Award, Hulce could have just as easily scooped it up. I think, in the end, it's not that one performance is better than the other...It's just that Hulce is really annoying and Abraham is just incredible. Even people who aren't fans of Mozart (I've never listened to him myself) or aren't fans of these kinds of movies, I promise that you won't regret watching this film.GRADE: A-",5,Great Film,1174608000,"03 23, 2007",2007,2407,"['Milos', 'Forman', 'Amadeus', 'fictional', 'story', 'Wolfgang', 'Amadeus', 'Mozart', 'bitter', 'rival', 'Antonio', 'Salieri', 'movie', 'swept', 'Academy', 'Award', 'ceremony', 'year', 'release', 'winning', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Best', 'Actor', 'F.', 'Murray', 'Abraham', 'Best', 'Director', 'five', 'others', 'place', 'American', 'Film', 'Institute', 'Top', '100', 'List', '53', 'odd', 'movie', 'classical', 'music', 'lot', 'opera', 'singing', 'most', 'appealing', 'thing', 'film', 'two', 'lead', 'performances', 'F.', 'Murray', 'Abraham', 'Salieri', 'Tom', 'Hulce', 'Mozart', 'film', 'Salieri', 'sympathetic', 'character', 'fact', 'jealous', 'only', 'quasi-talented', 'man', 'jealous', 'someone', 'else', 'gifts', 'Meanwhile', 'Mozart', 'character', 'should', 'feel', 'yet', 'whole', 'movie', 'end', 'want', 'kick', 'face', 'movie', 'many', 'years', 'Mozart', 'died', 'Salieri', 'once', 'great', 'composer', 'tries', 'commit', 'suicide', 'claiming', 'killed', 'Mozart', 'rest', 'film', 'flashback', 'Salieri', 'priest', 'story', 'story', 'how', 'longed', 'greatness', 'then', 'saw', 'most', 'brilliant', 'musician', 'time', 'form', 'Mozart', 'young', 'man', 'obnoxious', 'personality', 'annoying', 'laugh', 'Salieri', 'jealous', 'great', 'gifts', 'have', 'been', 'bestowed', 'immature', 'person', 'plotting', 'kill', 'Mozart', 'not', 'acquired', 'man', 'final', 'writings', 'Anyway', 'enough', 'synopsis', ""'m"", 'pretty', 'sure', ""'ve"", 'already', 'heard', 'anyway', 'movie', 'obviously', 'period', 'piece', 'have', 'lavish', 'costumes', 'people', 'writing', 'feathers', 'know', 'good', 'many', 'people', 'who', 'wo', ""n't"", 'watch', 'movie', 'reasons', 'Amadeus', 'feels', 'extraordinarily', 'modern', 'Forman', 'Czechoslovakian', 'director', 'who', 'made', 'films', 'there', 'then', 'came', 'America', 'great', 'success', 'great', 'director', 'film', 'one', 'greatest', 'triumphs', 'funny', 'great', 'dialogue', 'performances', 'are', 'once', 'again', 'DYNAMITE', 'Even', 'Abraham', 'won', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Hulce', 'could', 'have', 'just', 'easily', 'scooped', 'up', 'think', 'end', 'not', 'one', 'performance', 'better', 'other', 'just', 'Hulce', 'really', 'annoying', 'Abraham', 'just', 'incredible', 'Even', 'people', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'fans', 'Mozart', ""'ve"", 'never', 'listened', 'are', ""n't"", 'fans', 'kinds', 'movies', 'promise', 'wo', ""n't"", 'regret', 'watching', 'film.GRADE', 'A-']",N/A

Not only is this one of the best SOUNDING movies of all time - with Neville Mariner's wonderful renditions of Mozart's music - it is also on of the best LOOKING movies ever filmed.  As the documentary shows, it was filmed in Prague -which is the most eighteenth-century-looking city in Europe.  The film would be ruined in pan-and-scan - you need letterbox to be able to take in the breathtaking compositions.  The film looks and sounds great.That having been said, I don't think that they needed to offer a ""two disc"" edition.  The ONLY thing on the second disc is the documentary, which could have easily fitted on the first disc.  This is merely another instance of the studio jacking up the price by offering a ""two disc special edition.""THE DIRECTOR'S CUT:  Amadeus was a long movie to begin with; now, with the extra footage, it clocks in at almost exactly three hours.  This is a LONG movie.  However, having now seen both versions, the Director's Cut does make more sense.  For instance, we get to see what really happens between Salieri and Mozart's wife.  It is never quite clear why they hate each other in the original.  Even better, we get more of the old Salieri talking.THE FILM ITSELF:  Peter Schaffer is one of the best, most underrated playwrights of our time.  Equus is one of the great masterpieces of modern theater.  The title credits get it right with ""Peter Schaffer's Amadeus"".  As the documentary shows however, the play was altered radically on its way from the stage to the screen (and not always for the better).  I can't help but feel, however, the Milos Forman is overrated as a filmmaker.  With One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, he found a movie formula - that of the plucky iconoclast - and he has been remaking that film OVER AND OVER as The People vs. Larry Flint, Man in the Moon...and Amadeus.  Whenever he deviates from that formula, the films flop.The main complaint people have against this film is the acting - specifically Tom Hulce as Mozart.  Perhaps it is because Milos Forman's first language is not English he misses the subtleties of performance.  In the documentary, he pontificates about how thousands of actors were tested, and how important casting is.  But the question remains - why didn't he do better?  He casts mostly American actors and, for some reason, you just can't buy eighteenth-century dialogue coming from contemporary American accents.  The exception to this, of course, is F. Murray Abraham, who won an Oscar for this performance.  He is an accomplished theater actor who knows how to use his voice.  Even though he does not affect an English accent, he knows how to do elevated dialogue so we believe his Salieri.  The best parts of the movie are of the old Salieri reciting Peter Schaffer's wonderful dialogue over the music of Mozart.",4,They could have fit it on one disc...,1082246400,"04 18, 2004",2004,2902,"['DVD', 'like', 'movie', 'MUST', 'be', 'viewed', 'DVD', 'theater', 'course', 'Not', 'only', 'one', 'best', 'SOUNDING', 'movies', 'time', 'Neville', 'Mariner', 'wonderful', 'renditions', 'Mozart', 'music', 'also', 'best', 'LOOKING', 'movies', 'ever', 'filmed', 'documentary', 'shows', 'was', 'filmed', 'Prague', '-which', 'most', 'eighteenth-century-looking', 'city', 'Europe', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'ruined', 'pan-and-scan', 'need', 'letterbox', 'be', 'able', 'take', 'breathtaking', 'compositions', 'film', 'looks', 'great.That', 'having', 'been', 'said', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'needed', 'offer', 'two', 'disc', 'edition', 'ONLY', 'thing', 'second', 'disc', 'documentary', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'fitted', 'first', 'disc', 'merely', 'instance', 'studio', 'jacking', 'up', 'price', 'offering', 'two', 'disc', 'special', 'edition', 'THE', 'DIRECTOR', 'CUT', 'Amadeus', 'was', 'long', 'movie', 'begin', 'now', 'extra', 'footage', 'almost', 'exactly', 'three', 'hours', 'LONG', 'movie', 'However', 'having', 'now', 'seen', 'versions', 'Director', 'Cut', 'make', 'more', 'sense', 'instance', 'get', 'see', 'what', 'really', 'Salieri', 'Mozart', 'wife', 'never', 'quite', 'clear', 'why', 'hate', 'other', 'original', 'Even', 'better', 'get', 'more', 'old', 'Salieri', 'talking.THE', 'FILM', 'ITSELF', 'Peter', 'Schaffer', 'one', 'best', 'most', 'underrated', 'playwrights', 'time', 'Equus', 'one', 'great', 'masterpieces', 'modern', 'theater', 'title', 'get', 'right', 'Peter', 'Schaffer', 'Amadeus', 'documentary', 'however', 'play', 'was', 'altered', 'radically', 'way', 'stage', 'screen', 'not', 'always', 'better', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'however', 'Milos', 'Forman', 'overrated', 'filmmaker', 'One', 'Flew', 'Cuckoo', 'Nest', 'found', 'movie', 'formula', 'plucky', 'iconoclast', 'been', 'remaking', 'film', 'OVER', 'AND', 'OVER', 'People', 'vs.', 'Larry', 'Flint', 'Man', 'Moon', 'Amadeus', 'Whenever', 'formula', 'films', 'flop.The', 'main', 'complaint', 'people', 'have', 'film', 'acting', 'specifically', 'Tom', 'Hulce', 'Mozart', 'Perhaps', 'Milos', 'Forman', 'first', 'language', 'not', 'English', 'subtleties', 'performance', 'documentary', 'how', 'thousands', 'actors', 'were', 'tested', 'how', 'important', 'casting', 'question', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'better', 'mostly', 'American', 'actors', 'reason', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'buy', 'eighteenth-century', 'dialogue', 'coming', 'contemporary', 'American', 'accents', 'exception', 'course', 'F.', 'Murray', 'Abraham', 'who', 'won', 'Oscar', 'performance', 'accomplished', 'theater', 'actor', 'who', 'how', 'use', 'voice', 'Even', 'not', 'affect', 'English', 'accent', 'how', 'do', 'elevated', 'dialogue', 'believe', 'Salieri', 'best', 'parts', 'movie', 'are', 'old', 'Salieri', 'reciting', 'Peter', 'Schaffer', 'wonderful', 'dialogue', 'music', 'Mozart']",N/A

I had read reviews regarding the Director's Cut version of the film on Blu-ray, and they were not favorable. So, I waited and waited for the theatrical version to be released on Blu-ray to no avail. Finally, mostly because of the price reduction of this version - I finally purchased it. Having watched the Director's Cut, I fully agree with the consensus of negative reviews for it. This version adds about 20 minutes to the theatrical version, and I didn't find that a single added minute did anything to add value to the story. I won't go so far as to say it ruins it. This film is so good that even poorly added footage can't change its overall excellence, but there are portions of the added footage that do diminish the story in my opinion. We don't really see anything in this added footage that tells us more than we knew (at least not beneficially), but rather most of it just draws out a particular story element with superfluous information.The Blu-ray is great for visual and audio quality, so it may be considered worth it for that - but don't buy it because you think 20 minutes of added footage will enhance the experience of the movie.

102622,A1XZA0HJ10Z0VL,0790734060,Kameelyun,"[7, 8]","I was first shown this movie in the 8th grade at Bethany School, during our very last few music classes before graduation.  That was 1992.  Since then, I have devoured this masterpiece of cinematography time and time again.  I am very well aware that this is not an accurate documentary of Mozart's life, and there is indeed much outright fiction in this plot.  This does not diminish the power of the film.I won't dock any stars, but if I have one complaint about this Director's Cut, it is that we have no choice but to see the added scenes during the watching of the movie.  They should have given these extra scenes a separate spot on the special features menu, perhaps with an option of turning the scenes on or off while viewing the entire movie.  The scenes, while interesting if you are an Amadeus buff, are definitely extraneous and were originally cut out with good reason.  The topless Constanza scene where she gets double-crossed by Salieri is good for the obvious, but little more.  The scene with the dogs, and other additional scenes of dialogue, simply cause the movie to run for too long.  Also, the second DVD with the interviews is excellent and warrants an extra star.This film, along with ""Mr. Holland's Opus,"" remind me what classical music, indeed music *period*, is all about.  It also reminds me of how stupid and unproductive jealousy is.  I don't say this as a moralistic preacher; I am a professional classical violinist myself, and while I am highly talented and can play most (but not all) music ever written for the violin, I was by no means a prodigy, I didn't receive any kind of first-rate training until the college years, and at the moment I face a maelstrom of competition just to win a section position in, say, the Richmond Symphony in Virginia (in other words, an honorable and professional but not-top-5 orchestra).  During my late undergrad and Masters degree years, I met a number of violinists who WERE full-blown prodigies.  Some of these people were easily able, it seemed, to win a job with a major orchestra like the New York Philharmonic.  I can completely sympathize with Salieri's jealousy, particularly towards Mozart the Child, who received nothing but the best of the best of the best training, mostly from his highly musical father.  Many musical prodigies I have known in my own life are so perfect precisely because of error-free training early in the childhood years, something I most certainly did not receive.With regard to my own personal circumstances, it's so easy to be consumed with jealousy over these prodigy-darlings, but when I watch ""Amadeus,"" I think to myself: ""Gee, Salieri, just imagine if you had chosen to be Mozart's friend instead.  What if you had refused to allow jealousy to get the upper hand?  Think of the great friendship and wonderful musical projects the two of you could have collaborated on!""Then one day, while watching this film again, I said to myself: ""Come on, now, Adam.

That, combined with not having to turn the disc over (there was one dvd where you did, another where you did not) is alone worth the investment.The uncompressed audio is also quite beautiful.  Personally I would have liked to have heard more the crowd sounds, both in theater and public scenes, use the surround option a bit more.  Without knowledge of what the audio engineers working on this version had access to, it's hard to be overly critical here, not to mention that can often be a question of personal taste, and the disc really does sound great.Please note that this disc (at least mine) does NOT default to HD audio!  You have to go into the menu and set it up.  I've noticed that some Blu-ray will default, while others do not.Ok..  to the director's cut.  While I of course found the new footage interesting, I do not think that all of it was necessary and really illustrated that often the correct choice was made the first time around.  Others have really liked the additions, which brings me to my point.  I really wish these director's cut Blu-rays would offer BOTH cuts to the owner.  Take a lead from the Close Encounters disc, where not only are all four cuts included, but you can toggle between them in real time, and there is even an option of a ""timeline"" at the bottom of the screen to compare what was added or deleted.Extras..  beyond the inclusion of the Mozart cd (a nice touch) there is really nothing new here.  The one extra is the ""making of"" which is identical to the one on the dvd.  The commentary is new, and there is the occasional interesting tidbit to be found.The packaging with the included booklet is very elegant; actually one of the better ones I've seen.Bottom line, I think most of you will want this because you want this classic film to look great and sound great, and as such you will not be disappointed.

A. Mozart so perfectly you forget that he's even acting it out.  He acts so much like he is actually the real musical genius, it's amazing.  He portrays Mozart much like I actually pictured the man: very energetic.  The way he conducts sometimes shows how energetic Mozart actually was in life.The loving wife of Mozart, Contanze, or ""Stanzi,"" is played by Elizabeth Berridge.  She is a very loving, yet sometimes rude and angry, woman, who is introduced as his fiancee at the production of the opera ""The Abduction of the Seraglio.""  This gets him into a lot of trouble with the woman who thought Mozart loved her.  The emporer finally suggests that the two marry, and eventually, they do.The academy-award winning performance of F. Murray Abraham as Saliere was astounding and spooky beyond all reason.  His performance is filled with hate, the way the performance should be.  He is amazingly realistic when he starts saying that God is his worst enemy.  His portrayal of Salieri should give you the Flibbertywiggymigs, and if not, there is probably something wrong with you.  Later in the movie, he comes to the dying Mozart in a costume that his dead father had worn to a party, and commissions a Requiem from the man, so that Salieri can proclaim that it is his own work and say that he wrote it for Mozart.The comical emperor Joseph is acted out by Jeffrey Jones.  Well, there it is.  He is extraordinary as the tone-deaf piano-playing ruler of Italy.  A nice touch it is when he recalls the incident with young Mozart, about 7, proposes to his sister Antoinette.  He talks about Antoinette at intervals throughout the movie, and his performance is quite enjoyable.An honorary mention would be the parody actor, who commissions a fantasy opera, ""The Magic Flute,"" from Mozart.Granted, I did not see the R-rated version.  I saw the original PG-rated version.  But it was still one of the greatest movies in movie history.I would recommend this for ages 11 and up.  It is rated PG for harsh language, mostly.  The R-rated version is rated R for brief nudity, but again, I will say that I have not seen it.This is a full recommendation!  It is a five-star movie without a doubt.  You must see this!

The story, although fictionalized, is an intriguing one. Salieri, the pious man who prayed to God to be given sublime musical talent, has to face the fact that God has given it to Mozart, who is exuberant, childish, and bawdy. Salieri's subsequent jealousy drives the entire movie. You can see his character becoming more and more consumed by his extremely negative feelings. The character of Mozart, on the other hand, is fun, even though the real Mozart wasn't really that over-the-top. I might add, however, that the distinguishing giggle is actually historically accurate. Listen to the commentary on the DVD and Peter Shaffer himself even mentions something to that effect. Although it was delightful to see the film in its entirety, I could see why some of the scenes were deleted. They simply weren't that strong or they distracted the viewer from the main focus. The only real complaint I had was that there weren't more extras. It does have the commentary, the original trailer, and the short featurette which consists of various people looking back at making the film, but I would have liked to have seen an actual ""making of"" documentary from around the time the film was being made.

This lush, accesible &amp; very moving introduction to the music of Mozart could only be improved by the crispness of DVD &amp; improved sound of Dolby 5.1. But this set gets even better than just technical improvements; it answers many questions film buffs have asked over the years.The 2nd disc includes a 20th Anniversary documentary on the making of Amadeus. This documentary gave a new dimension to the film, at least in my eyes. For instance, all of the opera sequences were filmed in an opera house that has been almost completely untouched by the past centuries; this opera house was where Don Giovanni actually premiered! The casting choices are explained (I had always wondered how Elizabeth Berridge got the role of Constanza), &amp; many technical aspects, such as Hulce's performances on piano are explained. I found this documentary fascinating!The additional scenes added by Forman to make this a &quot;Director's Cut&quot; do not add to the movie, in my opinion. Amadeus was a perfect gem to start, &amp; the additional sequences slow things down. The only scene that adds dimension to the film is the one in which Constanza attempts to seduce Salieri. His rejection of her explains her later antipathy towards his presence in her apartment. Other than this scene, the others deal almost exclusively with Salieri's internal demons &amp; are adequately covered in the original cut. The oft repeated &quot;too many notes&quot; should have been kept in mind by Forman!Please, do yourself a favor &amp; purchase Amadeus:Director's Cut.

It is a very great film, exceptionally worthy of its Oscars, and the role of a lifetime for Tom Hulse. The operatic and musical scenes in this film succeed on a scale never seen before. The finale of &quot;Don Giovanni&quot; is better in this movie than in the two live performances I've seen and the performance Herbert von Karajan led that was shown on PBS in 1990. The direction, acting, script and locations are all sumptuous. It apparently does not follow the play on which it is based, but artistic difference is the basis of enjoyment. Having said all this, I would caution viewers not to judge the real-life Mozart by the portrayal of Hulse in this film. The real Mozart, I have read, was a prudish workaholic that would never go out drinking with his buddies. He also played by the rules of the day and adored Salieri, respecting his role as the musical director in Vienna. Still, it's fair to set history aside in a work of art this fine.

Murray Abraham) relates to a disbelieving priest the story of his obsession with Mozart's musical genius and how it led to jealousy, betrayal, and possibly even murder...Sumptuous evocation of a time and place, using Mozart's glorious music both to propel the story and underline the emotional dynamics of Peter Shaffer's extraordinary script. Based on his well-received stage play, and completely reworked for the screen, AMADEUS (1984) - and its updated version, reviewed here as AMADEUS: DIRECTOR'S CUT, released in 2001 - portrays Mozart's world as a romantic marriage of Royal palaces and candle-lit garrets, populated by eccentric emperors and their devious, toadying lackeys.The composer himself is played by Hulce as a spoiled, egotistical brat who indulges his passion for earthly pleasures with all the enthusiasm he brings to his musical compositions. But the film is anchored by Abraham in an Oscar-winning turn as Mozart's nemesis Salieri, consumed by envy and hatred whilst simultaneously awed by his rival's genius, the genius which Salieri had wished for himself, only to be denied by a mischievous God. The scenes in his asylum cell - where the elder Salieri confesses his 'crime' to a naive priest (Richard Frank) - are a tour de force, played with an intensity that simply burns up the screen.Beautifully designed and photographed, and bolstered by a magnificent supporting cast (including Jeffrey Jones, Simon Callow and Kenneth McMillan in a role completely excised from the original theatrical print), the movie unfolds like an operatic melodrama which builds to a shattering climax, as the two central characters reach an understanding (of sorts) during the writing of Mozart's 'Requiem', only to be divided forever by an unexpected tragedy. A masterpiece.NB. Incredibly, the MPAA has given the film an R rating for a brief sequence in which a female character bares her breasts to the camera. Surely this kind of sexual squeamishness belongs to the Dark Ages, not the 21st century?!

There are movies I watch several times because they're involving. And then there are movies I own because they are immensely powerful. Amadeus is definitely one that I own, and one that I highly encourage others to watch several times if not own.Nearly 3 hours long, Amadeus is a work of art. There are numerous of Mozart's works on display here, not only with the gorgeous music, but put into a context. You can see why Mozart created these works and how they were received. You see the sets, see the environments they were put on within. Yes, you can argue about whether Mozart had that kind of laugh or whether he behaved the way the movie claims he did. But that's all beside the point. We'll never really know. What we DO know is the fantastic works of art he created, and how they are experienced when put on by a high quality orchestra, presented in full sound and color.What's amazing is that the main actor here, F. Murray Abraham, isn't even playing Mozart. He's the antagonist, Salieri, whose only desire in life is to create beautiful music for God. When he sees how short his talents are compared with Mozart, and what a disappointment Mozart is in so many other ways, he makes it his quest in life to take Mozart down. What follows is heartbreaking.There are so many little touches in the story that catch at you. The way Mozart is oblivious to how he's hurting Salieri when he has fun embellishing the march. To him it's simple child's play to make the march more interesting. The way he has fun playing upside down and backwards. He enjoys his gift. He feels lonely that few understand him.On the down side, there were many important women involved in this situation who are barely touched on. Salieri's obsession is a talented opera singer. And then there's Mozart's wife.

The character is alive and real - although the dialogue is in today's English, it makes it more compelling.  There is some poetic license in the movie, but the story is a good biography set in the early 1800's.A priest rides into Salzberg to hear an old man's confession to a priest of his jealousy of Mozart (Tom Hulce) and anger toward God that he did not inherit Mozart's talent.  The old man is Antonio Saleri and his narration gives the story of Mozart's life.  He starts with how Mozart's father takes him to royal courts and makes him perform like a ""little monkey"".  Antonio Saleri was a famous musician in Vienna and part of the King's court.  He feels overshadowed by Mozart - a young, spoiled, raucous upstart, that can compose heavenly music - that only God could have given him this amazing talent..We see and hear Mozart's masterful works performed, as well as his new and innovative ways of presenting opera and symphonies.Mozart attends a party with his father and wife - and ends up mocking Saleri's music in good fun.  Saleri is behind a mask (masks were popular at the time) and is insulted.  The genius of Mozart is framed as Saleri is more and more tormented that only he would understand the gift - and revere thankfully worship God with dignity.  He is so angry he burns a crucifix.Mozart's life is short, debt-ridden, but burns bright.  He has immortality in his music.  Saleri knows he will never be remembered as great as Mozart, and as a weak, embittered man continues plotting to be more famous.

I had only recently re-watched the film, and wasn't sure I wanted to see it again, so soon.  But when I realized how much extra footage was there, I got curious.  With all the formerly excised bits put in, the flow of the narrative becomes clearer.  Salieri becomes more pathetically wicked, and Mozart becomes more worthy of our empathy; especially from the standpoint of &quot;the plight of the artist&quot;.  We more fully understand their motivations.Even Mozart's wife's character is complexified, as well as their marriage (a short spat scene).  Thus it takes on a character unlike the original.  It's just a bit less &quot;easy&quot;, as most Hollywood productions are these days.But I'm still not sure I prefer this.  This is because, although, as I say, this &quot;psuedo biography&quot; makes more sense in its narrative, the scenes that were added are sometimes questionable from a qualitative standpoint.  There is an American actor who plays a patron, for example, who hires Mozart to teach his young daughter music; but the scene is so over the top, that it's easy to see why it got cut.  Though, you'll understand (and it speaks volumes about how Mozart is portrayed), why Mozart is so smugly sucking on a wine bottle as he walks through the busy streets afterward.But the scene in which I always thought Salieri's final reaction to Frau Mozart's ploy to get him to help them--wherein he drops the portfolio and leaves the room--makes a lot more sense here.  So some of the revived scenes fix small annoyances like this one.So, as I say, if, like me, this is one of your favorite films, you won't be disappointed by this version, but you will begin to think, perhaps, that the film would have seemed a bit flawed if all of this had been released in the first place.  And even wonder if it would have been so popular.  So buy the original theatrical version, and rent this--you may like it, but it's left me conflicted--and thus you may decide for yourself before plonking down the loot, how you feel.Some movies are like old friends, and it's a little difficult to adjust, if say, for instance they show up with a nose job....same deal here.",3,"Yes, it makes more sense, but is it better?",1066003200,"10 13, 2003",2003,2244,"['first', 'thing', 'did', 'was', 'watch', 'quot', 'making', 'quot', 'documentary', 'had', 'only', 'recently', 're-watched', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'wanted', 'see', 'again', 'so', 'soon', 'when', 'realized', 'how', 'much', 'extra', 'footage', 'was', 'there', 'got', 'curious', 'formerly', 'excised', 'bits', 'put', 'flow', 'narrative', 'becomes', 'clearer', 'Salieri', 'more', 'pathetically', 'wicked', 'Mozart', 'more', 'worthy', 'empathy', 'especially', 'standpoint', 'quot', 'plight', 'artist', 'quot', 'more', 'fully', 'understand', 'motivations.Even', 'Mozart', 'wife', 'character', 'complexified', 'as', 'well', 'marriage', 'short', 'spat', 'scene', 'Thus', 'character', 'original', 'just', 'bit', 'less', 'quot', 'quot', 'most', 'Hollywood', 'productions', 'are', 'days.But', ""'m"", 'still', 'not', 'sure', 'prefer', 'because', 'say', 'quot', 'biography', 'quot', 'more', 'sense', 'narrative', 'scenes', 'were', 'added', 'are', 'sometimes', 'questionable', 'qualitative', 'standpoint', 'American', 'actor', 'who', 'patron', 'example', 'who', 'Mozart', 'teach', 'young', 'daughter', 'music', 'scene', 'so', 'top', 'easy', 'see', 'why', 'got', 'cut', ""'ll"", 'understand', 'volumes', 'how', 'Mozart', 'portrayed', 'why', 'Mozart', 'so', 'smugly', 'sucking', 'wine', 'bottle', 'busy', 'streets', 'afterward.But', 'scene', 'always', 'thought', 'Salieri', 'final', 'reaction', 'Frau', 'Mozart', 'ploy', 'get', 'help', 'wherein', 'portfolio', 'room', 'lot', 'more', 'sense', 'here', 'revived', 'scenes', 'fix', 'small', 'annoyances', 'one.So', 'say', 'one', 'favorite', 'films', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed', 'version', 'will', 'begin', 'think', 'perhaps', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'seemed', 'bit', 'flawed', 'had', 'been', 'released', 'first', 'place', 'even', 'wonder', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'popular', 'So', 'buy', 'original', 'theatrical', 'version', 'rent', 'may', 'like', 'left', 'conflicted', 'thus', 'may', 'decide', 'plonking', 'down', 'loot', 'how', 'feel.Some', 'movies', 'are', 'old', 'friends', 'little', 'difficult', 'adjust', 'say', 'instance', 'show', 'up', 'nose', 'job', '.same', 'deal', 'here']",N/A

To be honest, there weren't any instant classics in the top five in 1984, and AMADEUS is still the most famous, so ...While I can't really compare it with the theatrical version (which I haven't seen in over ten years), the director's cut is opulent, fascinating ... and really, really long.  The acting by Tom Hulce and especially F Murray Abraham is quite wonderful, as is the music, and the sets are astounding, but it's just ... long.  At three hours, it does tax the buttocks.That being said, the DVD itself is impressive, with a newly-mixed 5.1 soundtrack.  There's also a commentary with Forman and Peter Shaffer, who wrote the play the movie was based on, and explain their choices in changing certain aspects of the play (last year I played Mozart in a production of AMADEUS, and I was shocked at how much the film differs from the play, not only content-wise but also, in a lesser way, thematically).

The new director's cut adds a few scenes that clarify some parts of the story. It is a long but there are no parts I felt could have been left out.Even though the movie is about Mozart the title is his middle name 'Amadeus'. And for that there is a reason. This movie is not really about Mozart but about the Italian court-composer Salieri. A man who was a rival of Mozart and envied his talent.Salieri is a man fighting with God. God helps him first with the death of his father so he can learn music. He goes to Vienna and meets Mozart but is astounded to see that he is just a vulgar little man.Saliere is insulted by Mozart all the time in love but also in music. There is a scene where Mozart meets the emperor and the emperor plays a little march written by Salieri. Mozart replays it and starts to freshen it up, mocking the old piece. Salieri loves and loaths Mozart at the same time, asking God why much talent is in such a vulgar little man while he has so little, being completely godfearing. The title of the movie alsorefers to that since it means 'beloved of god'.The notion of sex (Mozart has an affair with the woman Salieri loves) becomes  more clear in the directors cut, something that was missing from the old  version. Also the very strained relationship with Salieri and Mozart's wife. Another cut scene was when he is teaching but is interrupted by digs but walks out and grabs a bottle of champagne. He drinks the bottle  on the street before coming home to see that his father returned.The audio option with remarks by Forman and author Peter Schaffer is very interesting. About  casting, the trouble with location and shooting scenes in then communist Czechoslovakia. Also things about the real life of Mozart'Amadeus' is not a biopic! It's a succesful play based on sources and letters. Some tings have changed for the play and the movie so don't see it as the actual life of Mozart.F Murray Abraham is brilliant as Salieri, and most of all as the old Salieri talking to a priest to tell of his plans and his life fighting Mozart.Outstanding also are the costumes and of course the brilliant music of one of the greatst composers of all time.

Take it for what it is, which is a beautifully photographed and composed film offering a great feast for your senses.I liked the confusion surrounding the essence of Salieri's character, because while he's jealous and insulted by the arrogance and talent of Mozart, he's also intrigued and strangely drawn to him with an almost obsessive reverence. The film was long, don't get me wrong, but the whole plot was successfully executed for the sake of sacrificing the audience's attention span.This film also brought about a new interest in Mozart and classical music for me, which is also why this film gets five stars.

Personally I find some of the newer stuff enhances the story overall and fills in some details that were left vague in the original theatrical release. I won't give away any details, but there is a new scene between Mozart's wife, Constanza, and Salieri, Mozart's chief musical rival (and secret arch-enemy) early in the movie that puts an whole new perspective of Salieri's twisted and battered psyche.As for the DVD itself, the picture and sound quality are both exemplary. Included is a second disk with bonus material including interviews and making-of extras.If you loved the original, you owe it to yourself to pick up this version.

Edelman,"[0, 0]","When this movie version of what had been a huge Broadway hit was announced, critics and Broadway fans alike were excited- although some of the casting seemed odd, to say the least. F. Murray Abraham as Salieri was an inspired choice, to be sure, but Tom Hulce as Mozart? The kid from &#34;Animal House&#34;? But Hulce turned out to be an excellent choice as the alternately depressed and manic Mozart, Abraham was of course brilliant, and the then-unknown Elizabeth Berridge, who was brought in to replace an injured Meg Tilly after the film was already in production, did a great job in bringing the role of Constanze to life. The costumes, the sets, the direction, Neville Mariner's score and the script were all similarly brilliant.The director's version adds about twenty minutes to the theatrical release, and while it's been twenty eight years since I saw the original version of this film in the theater (!)

I for one love the directors cut. Bought it on DVD when it was first released in 2003, and then bought the two disc edition on Blu Ray when released. The directors cut adds a number of different angles that were never more than slightly hinted at in the theatrical cut, and without having seen the added footage it's not like it felt like you had just missed something because it ran together seamlessly. I for one enjoy those added elements, but I'm also someone who likes directors cuts. I can honestly see and understand though why some prefer the theatrical cut. It could be seen the added footage is just superfluous unnecessary  extra story. I Still think it adds something though. I do think they should make the theatrical cut available for those who prefer it.It's a wonderful yarn about Mozart's' time in Vienna. There is very little historical fact in it so just take it as a wonderful ride of intrigue. It's also a sensational introduction to Mozart's amazing music.

With a polite smile and a blank expression, the priest responds that he did not.Then Salieri stops for a second, and then asks, what about this tune? He plays another, and suddenly the priest's eyes light up in instant recognition and shouts: oh yes I know this one, is this yours?Salieri with a very bitter sigh responds: this is Mozart!What a way to start a film and what a scene to introduce that masterpiece that is Amadeus.A genuis child prodigy that was Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart took Europe by storm, and success,fame,admiration,sponsorship and financial protection was the natural result.But there was a  darker side to that fame: the excesses, the gossip, the conspiracies, the politics of the court, Mozart's own inner demons, and his peculiar relationship with his father, respect that hides fear. And of course there was Salieri!A veteran at the royal courts, a mediocre composer who has found a secure place for his limited talent,only to find its very foundations threatened by this newcomer..Jealousy and  bitterness were the natural outcome, but carefully hidden by the guise of friendliness and protective wisdom, while Mozart still retaining a trusting naivity that would eventually hasten his downfall.This is the story of THE best musical biography ever filmed(Period!), from a director who is no 'hired hand' but an artist in his own right. It is a very ambitious film, very lush, beautiful to watch and hear, an epic of dramatic and musical propotions.There are good music biographies,like Ken Russell's Music Lovers (Russell has a life long passion for classical music), his own unique version of Tchaikovsky's life, in addition to Lizstmania and Mahler. Beethoven had an excellent and underrated biography in Immortally Beloved, but still Amadeus remains in a league of its own.This status comes from the fact that the director and writer successfully manage to give an equal treatment to the music,the genuis of Mozart, and to the human drama, the essence of Mozart. The opera/concert scenes are not hurried but remain an integral part of the plot.(more of these scenes were added for the extended version)F Murray Abraham won a deserved Oscar for playing Salieri so perfectly, but I would have loved for Tom Hulce to have won his nomination too: a pity since he has brought so much life and creativity to his role.Now another scene,A dying,weak and delirious Mozart lying in his bed is dictating his latest composition to Salieri (pretending till the end to be the trusted friend)..Mozart is slow at first, but then as if suddenly possessed by the demon of music, the notes started flowing, faster than Salieri could write them, and not only flowing but the Italian composer is in a state of sheer disbelief at what he is actually writing, music  that would become the most haunting classic piece ever composed, the Requiem.You too will stare in disbelief at this creativity unfolding in front of Salieri's  eyes and yours too!Now how many films manage to do that??Hmmm..let me see.....",5,A Genuis that Suspends Belief!,1064880000,"09 30, 2003",2003,3167,"['old', 'senile', 'Salieri', 'sits', 'piano', 'playing', 'tunes', 'young', 'priest.He', 'melodies', 'playing', 'polite', 'smile', 'blank', 'expression', 'priest', 'responds', 'did', 'not.Then', 'Salieri', 'second', 'then', 'what', 'tune', 'suddenly', 'priest', 'eyes', 'light', 'up', 'instant', 'recognition', 'shouts', 'oh', 'yes', 'know', 'one', 'yours', 'Salieri', 'very', 'bitter', 'sigh', 'responds', 'Mozart', 'What', 'way', 'start', 'film', 'what', 'scene', 'introduce', 'masterpiece', 'Amadeus.A', 'genuis', 'child', 'prodigy', 'was', 'Wolfgang', 'Amadeus', 'Mozart', 'took', 'Europe', 'storm', 'success', 'fame', 'admiration', 'sponsorship', 'financial', 'protection', 'was', 'natural', 'result.But', 'was', 'darker', 'side', 'fame', 'excesses', 'gossip', 'conspiracies', 'politics', 'court', 'Mozart', 'own', 'inner', 'demons', 'peculiar', 'relationship', 'father', 'respect', 'fear', 'course', 'was', 'Salieri', 'veteran', 'royal', 'courts', 'mediocre', 'composer', 'who', 'found', 'secure', 'place', 'limited', 'talent', 'only', 'find', 'very', 'foundations', 'threatened', 'newcomer..Jealousy', 'bitterness', 'were', 'natural', 'outcome', 'carefully', 'hidden', 'guise', 'friendliness', 'protective', 'wisdom', 'Mozart', 'still', 'retaining', 'trusting', 'naivity', 'would', 'eventually', 'hasten', 'downfall.This', 'story', 'THE', 'best', 'musical', 'biography', 'ever', 'filmed', 'Period', 'director', 'who', ""'hired"", 'hand', 'artist', 'own', 'right', 'very', 'ambitious', 'film', 'very', 'lush', 'beautiful', 'watch', 'hear', 'epic', 'dramatic', 'musical', 'propotions.There', 'are', 'good', 'music', 'biographies', 'Ken', 'Russell', 'Music', 'Lovers', 'Russell', 'life', 'long', 'passion', 'classical', 'music', 'own', 'unique', 'version', 'Tchaikovsky', 'life', 'addition', 'Lizstmania', 'Mahler', 'Beethoven', 'had', 'excellent', 'underrated', 'biography', 'Immortally', 'Beloved', 'still', 'Amadeus', 'league', 'own.This', 'status', 'fact', 'director', 'writer', 'successfully', 'manage', 'give', 'equal', 'treatment', 'music', 'genuis', 'Mozart', 'human', 'drama', 'essence', 'Mozart', 'opera/concert', 'scenes', 'are', 'not', 'hurried', 'remain', 'integral', 'part', 'plot', 'more', 'scenes', 'were', 'added', 'extended', 'version', 'F', 'Murray', 'Abraham', 'won', 'deserved', 'Oscar', 'playing', 'Salieri', 'so', 'perfectly', 'would', 'have', 'loved', 'Tom', 'Hulce', 'have', 'won', 'nomination', 'too', 'pity', 'brought', 'so', 'much', 'life', 'creativity', 'role.Now', 'scene', 'A', 'dying', 'weak', 'delirious', 'Mozart', 'lying', 'bed', 'dictating', 'latest', 'composition', 'Salieri', 'pretending', 'end', 'be', 'trusted', 'friend', '..Mozart', 'slow', 'first', 'then', 'suddenly', 'possessed', 'demon', 'music', 'notes', 'started', 'flowing', 'faster', 'Salieri', 'could', 'write', 'not', 'only', 'flowing', 'Italian', 'composer', 'state', 'sheer', 'disbelief', 'what', 'actually', 'writing', 'music', 'would', 'become', 'most', 'haunting', 'classic', 'piece', 'ever', 'composed', 'Requiem.You', 'too', 'will', 'stare', 'disbelief', 'creativity', 'unfolding', 'front', 'Salieri', 'eyes', 'yours', 'too', 'Now', 'how', 'many', 'films', 'manage', 'do', 'Hmmm..let', 'see', '..']",N/A

Of course the movie tells us that Salieri contrived to get rid of Mozart and blocked his advancement from becoming the Emperor's Kapellmeister.Five main events are not shown in the movie:1)Mozart's claim that Salieri tried to poison him (this was never proved).2)The two notorious pupils Mozart taught, Beethoven and Sussmayr.Beethoven was a great admirer of Mozart and later used him as a  model (Piano concerto No 4 - G major - and Mozart's K503 - C major - is one example)3)In his last days Mozart composed his unfinished masterpiece (and never will) `The Requiem' that he discussed with Sussmayr (not Salieri). However there is no proof that Sussmayr was actually able to complete Mozart's Requiem.4)In Mozart's presence Salieri was brusque and even harsh in manner to Constanze (Mozart's wife), behaving like he was the only man in the Royal Family.5)Mozart's friendship with Hayden (They both were members of the same Masonic Lodge)Nevertheless, this movie inspires you with so many sentiments that one feels the loss of Mozart is like the loss of one's soul.",5,Impressive....,1161302400,"10 20, 2006",2006,1605,"['Music', 'apart', 'so', 'far', 'human', 'behaviour', 'concerned', 'movie', 'sense', 'annoyance', 'vicious', 'innovations', 'man', 'cunning', 'cleverness', 'consolidated', 'mainly', 'person', 'Antonio', 'Salieri.Interesting', 'see', 'Salieri', 'neat', 'costumes', 'ingratiating', 'obvious', 'feline', 'way', 'set', 'captivate', 'emperor', 'attention', 'please', 'friendly', 'enemy', 'Mozart.Perhaps', 'main', 'source', 'competition', 'Mozart', 'Salieri', 'was', 'related', 'who', 'would', 'be', 'able', 'win', 'Da', 'Ponte', 'librettos', 'other', 'course', 'movie', 'Salieri', 'contrived', 'get', 'rid', 'Mozart', 'blocked', 'advancement', 'becoming', 'Emperor', 'Kapellmeister.Five', 'main', 'events', 'are', 'not', 'shown', 'movie:1', 'Mozart', 'claim', 'Salieri', 'tried', 'poison', 'was', 'never', 'proved', '.2', 'two', 'notorious', 'pupils', 'Mozart', 'taught', 'Beethoven', 'Sussmayr.Beethoven', 'was', 'great', 'admirer', 'Mozart', 'later', 'used', 'model', 'Piano', '4', 'G', 'major', 'Mozart', 'K503', 'C', 'major', 'one', 'example', '3', 'last', 'days', 'Mozart', 'composed', 'unfinished', 'masterpiece', 'never', 'will', 'Requiem', 'discussed', 'Sussmayr', 'not', 'Salieri', 'However', 'proof', 'Sussmayr', 'was', 'actually', 'able', 'complete', 'Mozart', 'Requiem.4', 'Mozart', 'presence', 'Salieri', 'was', 'brusque', 'even', 'harsh', 'manner', 'Constanze', 'Mozart', 'wife', 'behaving', 'was', 'only', 'man', 'Royal', 'Family.5', 'Mozart', 'friendship', 'Hayden', 'were', 'members', 'same', 'Masonic', 'Lodge', 'Nevertheless', 'movie', 'so', 'many', 'sentiments', 'one', 'loss', 'Mozart', 'loss', 'one', 'soul']",N/A

Larry Flint, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, and Man on The Moon scores a all-time classic with Amadeus.  The film has subtle nuances that leap out at you with the penetrating performances of Tom Hulce as Mozart and his character foil F. Murray Abraham as Antonio Salieri.  The film score is broad and gives us a cross-section of Mozart's work transforming the film into a quasi-musical without ever losing the compelling thread of the storyline...a bitterly jealous less artistically-achieved composer admiring and hating the genius of the happy-go-lucky and brash Mozart.  The convention is really ingenious with F. Murray Abraham giving a convincing performance as an older cankerous Salieri.  Who really cares if this entirely historically accurate?  That's not the point.  The film shows a devout appreciation of Mozart's music and gives it life weaving its creation with the turns of the rocky course of Mozart's carefree, but ultimately tragic life.

And that's not bad, considering I was *5-years old!!* when the film came out in theatres and I first saw it. The director's cut still seems a bit foreign, because I have nearly the whole movie memorised, each scene, musical piece and dialogue, and I'm just not used to the new bits.But, even so, the director's cut is downright brilliant! Whether the &quot;original&quot; release or the &quot;special edition&quot;, this movie is ingenious and masterful.There isn't a flaw in this film. Ok, it's not a biography, but it never pretended to be. This is the life of Mozart as seen through the mad, jealous eyes of Salieri. Usually, huge historic deviances annoy the heck out of me, but in this case, they're all acceptable, and no one minds them a bit, thanks to a FABULOUS screenplay, tremendous acting and brilliant directing.Everyone is perfectly cast, whether originally designed for the role or no. I'm SO glad Meg Tilly wasn't cast as Constanze, as was originally planned for. She would have ruined the film. All the actors in this movie were perfect, so thank Fate for how it ended up!We are able to immediately feel appropriate emotions for all the characters involved - distrust of, and yet pity for Salieri, distrust of Dir. Rosenberg, love for Mozart, admiration for the shrewd Constranze, and love for the somewhat simple-seeming Emperor Joseph, God love him.Fabulous music performances by the incomparable Neville Martin.

It truly is some of the best filmaking in the history of movies.  Many of the 'less than stellar' reviews for this film are mainly due to its director's cut treatment.  Some felt the deleted scenes needed to stay deleted.  I have never seen the original theatrical release so I really cannot comment on this.Although called Amadeus, it's more than just his biography.  It's more about one man's undying obsession with Mozart.  Look at the title refering more to a condition rather than a person.  The obsession that has consumed the story's protagonist, Salieri, as the story traces his life through the years constantly living in the shadow of friend/secret enemy Amadeus.  As many other reviewers have pointed out, the absolutely most brilliant scene in the movie takes place near the end as a dying Mozart is composing Requiem with Salieri documenting the notes.  Barely able to move, Amadeus suddenly becomes enthralled with the music in his head as he dictates Salieri's writing.  One of the most powerful scenes I have ever seen in a film.As for the production value and the digital transfer, there is absolutely no indication that this movie was filmed in 1984.

Is there any real, and I mean REAL evidence that the composer was vulgar?? After studying music for ever 40 years, I can say, with some authority that we have None, NONE at all.  He was a young man, of phenomenal talent and vivid imagination and boundless energy.  A brilliant comet the streaked across the musical sky of Europe, transforming music forever.  No one like him before or since.  He had many imitators but no superiors, not a one.  And, certainly not Seniore Salieri, played to the hilt by F. Murray Abrams.  Elizabeth Bainbridge plays Constanze Mozart his Amadeus's flirtatious spouse.  Despite all the wonderful music and light hearted humor, and this IS a delightful film, there are some glaring inconsistencies.  For one, in the year before his death, his daughter died as a very young child, and Mozart, not Hulse, was devastated.  to labor on his last great work, the Requiem, awarded to him as an anonymous commission, by a mystery messenger.  Yet, of his daughter's tragic death , there is no mention what so ever.  I found this grossly irresponsible of the producers and the director Milos Forman.  Filmed largely in the old city section of modern Prague, it does show a slice of 18th Century Vienna and the performing customs and general life of those times.  The roles of the Emperor, the Theater Director and others were wonderfully  portrayed by a cluster of British actors  including the versatile Roy Dotrice.  Why, he even looked like &#34;Papa,&#34; and probably researched his role diligently for accuracy.Sir Neville Marriner leads the musical forces of ______________________ in a wonderful and timely score.  I loved the scene where Mrs. Mozart took a folder of sheet music of her husband, to the pompous Court Composer, Salieri, asking for his assistance in getting them performed so they could avoid bankruptcy.  As he leafs through the stack, we hear the music, a concerto, an opera aria, a quartet, a symphonic movement etc. etc.  On and On, as he was capable of doing.  Cranking out volumes of works, perfect as a fine gem.  Salieri is overwhelmed, emotionally and intellectually, as the papers slip from his hands and fall to the floor.  The wife asks, &#34;IS it not good?&#34;  Stunned, sailers utters , &#34;it is miraculous.&#34;  Indeed!As a real man, Mozart was an energetic bustling genius and music simply poured out of him like water.  All of it perfect, no sign of corrections or editing, ready for the publisher.  The pompous and deviously envious  Salieri now slowly was becoming an ardent admirer, rather than a jelous competitor with no chance in Hell of matching his talent.  He was Babe Ruith hitting in a Little League park.. An Indy car racing against the soap box derby entrants.  Nobody stood a chance against him.  He was, besides Beethoven and Haydn the greatest composer of all-time, though few in those days were even remotely aware of his star status.This film was intended to be a less than serious picture of the composer, but it is presented as gospel truth, whic it is not.  If, however, you keep this in mindduring the viewing of Amadeu, you will find it a terrific movie.  I have managed to do just this, and oversome my mild discust at the mockery they imply bvy the charcter portrayal.  Just sit back and watch.  If, however, this movie sparks in you a genuine interst in the real man, there are always sites like Amazon where you can buy Cd's and begin to learn something about him, through the truest of emtrhods, his musci.  I have too much admiration and respect for his memory to not deduct a full star for the producers aggretious offences against his persona, and therefore I say only a 4 star rating, when it should of been off the charts.

Like most playwrights, Peter Shaffer (he of Equus) was not interested in historical accuracy to documentary standard - and nor is this picture. In fact, it's much cleverer than that - what we get here is a beautifully scripted essay on Envy, God and your Just Deserts (and why you don't always get them), played out between light and dark in the beautiful setting of Prague. As befits a theatrical adaptation, the symbolism is stark - Mozart's white (even manifesting itself in a dove at one point, for heaven's sake) plays the establishment's black. For the most part, you can judge the sympathies of a given character at a point in time by the colour of his or her wig.

102681,A1SJY5YL6LNIV2,0790734060,Pen Name,"[14, 15]","I'm writing this review as someone who absolutely loves the film ""Amadeus.""  It really is one of the top ten films made after 1980 -- a gorgeous, engrossing, funny, hugely entertaining achievement.I'm also writing this review as someone who does not own the Blu-Ray edition and in fact refuses to buy it in its current form, even at the low, low sale price of $13.99.Why?  And why only two stars?  For one reason and one reason only:  this Blu-Ray edition does not (as far as I can tell) contain the original theatrical release.When ""Blade Runner"" was released on Blu-Ray last year, I snatched it up immediately.  I even paid $30+ for it -- gladly.  Why?  There were FIVE DIFFERENT VERSIONS of the film included in the package, including the original release with Harrison Ford's voiceover.When ""The Godfather Trilogy"" was released on Blu-Ray, I paid more than $40 for it -- gladly -- because they had ALL THREE Godfather films included in the package.So it's baffling why they didn't do the same thing with ""Amadeus.""  At $30+ or even $40+ it would've been a steal.  Without the original theatrical cut, I wouldn't pay more than $5 for this Blu-Ray disc.I own the standard-definition DVDs of ""Amadeus"" -- both the original theatrical version (released in 1997!!) AND the Director's Cut that was released a few years later.  While the Director's Cut DOES make some things a little clearer in the story, nothing in the Director's Cut -- NOTHING -- makes it a better film.  With all due respect to Milos Forman, the original theatrical version is VASTLY SUPERIOR to the Director's Cut.  The storytelling is tighter, the film more engrossing.  The scenes that were added in the Director's Cut with Kenneth MacMillan and the barking dogs would've been better in a Deleted Scenes section of the DVD -- they're extraneous, superfluous.  Too many notes.It's like the French plantation sequence in ""Apocalypse Now"" (ANOTHER DVD package that was smart enough to include both the ""Redux"" version AND the original theatrical release), where you can't wait for the director's self-indulgent digression to end so you can get back to the story.I would MUCH prefer to watch my 1997 standard-definition DVD of the original theatrical release than pay more than $5 for this Blu-Ray edition.

This is a testament to it's enduring greatness.

Alright, we know that Salieri was not responsible for Mozart's death in history, but the movie isn't total fiction either. Many of the people were real and some of the events portrayed in the movie actually did happen.

Milos Forman's version of Peter Shaffer's play (Shaffer also wrote the screenplay) was roundly panned by sticklers for veering widely away from the real lives of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Antonio Salieri. Yes, their story is stretched and warped nearly beyond recognition, but that doesn't detract from the movie's dazzling performances of Mozart's best works and its fascinating riff on the natures of genius and mediocrity. An aging Salieri - excellently played by F. Murray Abraham in an Oscar-winning role - receives a mercy visit by a reluctant priest at an asylum, after he unsuccessfully attempts suicide. In telling the priest his story, Salieri becomes the movie's narrator as well as its soul and wit, while Mozart, played by Tom Hulce, remains something of an enigma. The locations (the story is set in Vienna but was shot in Czechoslovakia - before it split into the Czech Republic and Slovakia), costumes, and other period evocations are flawless, and the music is rapturous, in particular the performance of Mozart's ""Requiem"" at the finale.

Dick Smith's aging make-up is flawless, making it very easy to believe that Abraham is seventy+ years old as he parlays the role.The movie starts in an insane asylum where a fey young priest visits the decripit Salieri, who has recently attempted suicide. It is implied from the onset that Salieri feels a massive guilt for having ""killed"" Mozart through exhaustion and overwork. ""MOZART!! Forgive your assassin! I confess...I KILLED you, Mozart! I KILLED you....!""... The very first lines you hear after a massive Beethovenish chord is sounded at the start of the film.He goes on to tell the priest the story of himself and Mozart in the Viennese court of Emperor Joseph of Austria, portrayed here as an empty-headed fop by the recently notorious Jeffrey Jones. As the prodigal Mozart is about to be introduced to Joseph, Salieri, operatic director Count Orsini Rosenberg, Kappelmeister Bono and the visiting Baron Von Swieten, they are shocked to see him as an immature, cocky, obnoxious little boy, rather than the dignified matured prodigy they expected. Salieri is especially disappointed since he had worshipped Mozart when he was younger and emulated him all his life, achieving the rank of Court Composer through the inspiration of this admiration. He had even written a processional piece for Mozart's entrance especially for the reception, only to have Mozart tear it apart as repetitive and derivative, cackling at him with that irritating howl of a trademark laugh.From this moment on, Salieri and Mozart were bitter enemies, although Mozart doesn't realize it. He actually sees Salieri as an ally against the directors of Joseph's musical court, who constantly thwart Mozart's attempts at livening up the moribund Viennese musical zeitgest.In the end, as Mozart realizes that he may never attain true riches, partly due to the behind-the-scenes startegies of Salieri and Rosenberg, he grabs at anything that will provide food and a roof over the heads of his young wife and son. Enter, finally, Salieri, disguised as the image of Mozart's late father, to request a requiem mass for a ""deserving soul"". Little does Mozart realize that the ""deserving soul"" is himself!Maybe the ONLY thing askew about this incredible film is the odd miscasting of Mozart and Emperor Joseph....Tom Hulce bears NO resemblance to Wolfgang A. Mozart! However, Jeffrey Jones, who portrays the emperor, is the spit and image of him. Perhaps they should have checked to see if Andr&eacute; Previn, (who looks JUST like him), had a lookalike son or nephew! (However, Hulce  pretty much owns the role as Abraham owns Salieri. His portrayal of Mozart as a complete horse's ass is perfect for Peter Schaeffer's purposes.) Elizabeth Berridge's Constanza Mozart is cute and Berridge assays her as a type of person that American audiences would be immediately comfortable with, a kind of eighteenth century ""Shirley Feeney"". The poor girl's career, however, went nowhere after this, as did the careers of just about everybody ELSE in it, except for Jeffrey Jones, and even HIS is probably now kaput, due to his own grave mistakes.The sense of humor and the acting of even supernumeraries in the production has to be seen to be believed. (The scene in Schickenader's vaudeville house being an excellent example.)Finally, the movie can't be recommended enough, as it is a thing of near-perfection from beginning to end.",5,The best!,1068508800,"11 11, 2003",2003,4369,"['may', 'be', 'perfect', 'film', 'know', 'said', 'pretty', 'much', 'same', 'thing', 'Charade', 'one', 'few', 'deserving', 'films', 'actually', 'receive', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'r', 'were', 'mandated', 'Goldfinger', '2001', 'Star', 'Wars', 'Lion', 'Winter', 'Amadeus', 'received', 'meaningful', 'awards', 'rightly', 'deserved', 'story', 'envy', 'covetousness', 'Machiavellian', 'machinations', 'contemporary', 'Wolfgang', 'Amadeus', 'Mozart', 'Antonio', 'Salieri', 'who', 'had', 'misfortune', 'be', 'greatly', 'disappointed', 'young', 'hero', 'first', 'meeting', 'meeting', 'stayed', 'rest', 'life', 'plotted', 'second', 'meeting', 'rid', 'Viennese', 'court', 'creature', 'F', 'Murray', 'Abraham', 'revelation', 'role', 'Salieri', 'relishing', 'little', 'snarl', 'curse', 'Tom', 'Hulce', 'Mozart', 'cackling', 'glee', 'triumph', 'real', 'imagined', 'playing', 'young', 'old', 'Salieri', 'was', 'spirit', 'ressurrecting', 'Salieri', 'original', 'corpse', 'Dick', 'Smith', 'aging', 'make-up', 'flawless', 'making', 'very', 'easy', 'believe', 'Abraham', 'seventy+', 'years', 'old', 'role.The', 'movie', 'insane', 'asylum', 'where', 'fey', 'young', 'priest', 'decripit', 'Salieri', 'who', 'recently', 'attempted', 'suicide', 'implied', 'onset', 'Salieri', 'massive', 'guilt', 'having', 'killed', 'Mozart', 'exhaustion', 'overwork', 'MOZART', 'Forgive', 'assassin', 'confess', 'KILLED', 'Mozart', 'KILLED', 'very', 'first', 'lines', 'hear', 'massive', 'Beethovenish', 'chord', 'sounded', 'start', 'film.He', 'tell', 'priest', 'story', 'Mozart', 'Viennese', 'court', 'Emperor', 'Joseph', 'Austria', 'portrayed', 'here', 'empty-headed', 'fop', 'recently', 'notorious', 'Jeffrey', 'Jones', 'prodigal', 'Mozart', 'be', 'introduced', 'Joseph', 'Salieri', 'operatic', 'director', 'Count', 'Orsini', 'Rosenberg', 'Kappelmeister', 'Bono', 'visiting', 'Baron', 'Von', 'Swieten', 'are', 'shocked', 'see', 'immature', 'cocky', 'obnoxious', 'little', 'boy', 'rather', 'dignified', 'matured', 'prodigy', 'expected', 'Salieri', 'especially', 'disappointed', 'had', 'worshipped', 'Mozart', 'when', 'was', 'younger', 'emulated', 'life', 'achieving', 'rank', 'Court', 'Composer', 'inspiration', 'admiration', 'had', 'even', 'written', 'processional', 'piece', 'Mozart', 'entrance', 'especially', 'reception', 'only', 'have', 'Mozart', 'tear', 'apart', 'repetitive', 'derivative', 'cackling', 'irritating', 'howl', 'trademark', 'laugh.From', 'moment', 'Salieri', 'Mozart', 'were', 'bitter', 'enemies', 'Mozart', ""n't"", 'realize', 'actually', 'Salieri', 'ally', 'directors', 'Joseph', 'musical', 'court', 'who', 'constantly', 'thwart', 'Mozart', 'attempts', 'livening', 'up', 'moribund', 'Viennese', 'musical', 'zeitgest.In', 'end', 'Mozart', 'may', 'never', 'attain', 'true', 'riches', 'partly', 'due', 'behind-the-scenes', 'startegies', 'Salieri', 'Rosenberg', 'anything', 'will', 'provide', 'food', 'roof', 'heads', 'young', 'wife', 'son', 'Enter', 'finally', 'Salieri', 'disguised', 'image', 'Mozart', 'late', 'father', 'request', 'requiem', 'mass', 'deserving', 'soul', 'Little', 'Mozart', 'realize', 'deserving', 'soul', 'Maybe', 'ONLY', 'thing', 'askew', 'incredible', 'film', 'odd', 'miscasting', 'Mozart', 'Emperor', 'Joseph', '.Tom', 'Hulce', 'resemblance', 'Wolfgang', 'A.', 'Mozart', 'However', 'Jeffrey', 'Jones', 'who', 'emperor', 'spit', 'image', 'Perhaps', 'should', 'have', 'checked', 'see', 'Andr', 'eacute', 'Previn', 'who', 'JUST', 'had', 'lookalike', 'son', 'nephew', 'However', 'Hulce', 'pretty', 'much', 'role', 'Abraham', 'Salieri', 'portrayal', 'Mozart', 'complete', 'horse', 'ass', 'perfect', 'Peter', 'Schaeffer', 'purposes', 'Elizabeth', 'Berridge', 'Constanza', 'Mozart', 'cute', 'Berridge', 'type', 'person', 'American', 'audiences', 'would', 'be', 'immediately', 'comfortable', 'kind', 'eighteenth', 'century', 'Shirley', 'Feeney', 'poor', 'girl', 'career', 'however', 'went', 'nowhere', 'did', 'careers', 'just', 'everybody', 'ELSE', 'Jeffrey', 'Jones', 'even', 'HIS', 'probably', 'now', 'kaput', 'due', 'own', 'grave', 'mistakes.The', 'sense', 'humor', 'acting', 'even', 'supernumeraries', 'production', 'be', 'seen', 'be', 'believed', 'scene', 'Schickenader', 'vaudeville', 'house', 'being', 'excellent', 'example', 'Finally', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'recommended', 'enough', 'thing', 'near-perfection', 'beginning', 'end']",N/A
102688,A1GN8UJIZLCA59,0790734060,P Magnum,"[5, 5]","Milos Forman's Amadeus is a hugely entertaining adaptation of Peter Shaffer's play. The movie is told in flashback style from the memory of Antonio Salieri. Salieri was a successful and popular composer who was a rival of Mozart's. History has speculated on the death of Mozart and some people are of the opinion that Salieri had a hand in his death (possibly even murdered him). The film explores this angle of the legend. Salieri is consumed by his jealousy and hatred of the infantile Mozart. Mozart is a musical genius, but a wild spending and is always looking for the next good time. His operas are utterly brilliant, but are unsuccessful. He is in constant debt. Salieri concocts a plan for Mozart to compose a requiem. This work is actually planned as Mozart's own requiem. Mozart is shown as slowly going mad and at the end of the film, Salieri helps him by writing the musical score down for a very weak Mozart. The morning after Mozart and Salieri work together, Mozart is found dead and we are left speculating whether he died through natural causes or if Salieri did something to him. F. Murray Abrham is absolutely amazing as Salieri. He brings across the jealousy and hatred, but doesn't make Salieri a fiend. He has major respect for Mozart's musical talents, but doesn't understand why God would give them to such an obvious heathen. Tom Hulce is equally as good as Mozart. He plays him with a reckless abandon and in an over the top fashion that is perfectly suited for the role. The film took home the 1984 Best Picture Oscar, Mr. Forman won Best Director and Mr. Abrham beat out Mr. Hulce for Best Actor. This was a case where a tie would have been more than appropriate. The new director's cut adds 20 minutes of footage, but the real standout is the remastered sound.

Murray Abraham as Mozart's arch-enemy Antonio Salieri is what makes this movie work. Peter Shaffer, in adapting his brilliant script to a screenplay, maintained the position of Salieri as semi-narrator, leading the audience down the path of his obsession. We hear the music as Salieri hears it, hear Mozart's annoying, maddening, whinnying laugh as only Salieri can. The film has a bit of Fatal Attraction in it.... Salieri loves and despises Mozart's music and genius. He wants to both kill and *be* Mozart. Not being able to do either, he is a failure in his own mind as a model of mediocrity and impotence. Abraham is pitiable and abhorent. What he wishes to do is so much more hateful than what he does, that what we most despise is his inability to achieve any of his dreams...but we also pity him for it. He is not a villian, he is merely a mortal beside Mozart: ""God's instrument""...the ""magic flute"".Tom Hulce, as Mozart, delivers an amazing portrayal of a genius that makes you care for, sympathize with, and admire Mozart as a person, while also truly maddening you with his childishness and idiosyncracies until you dislike him just as much as Salieri does. His dual portrait is true and lifelike.The marriage of Mozart's music to this film is utterly amazing and complete. One could truly not exist without the other. Unlike other bio-films of great composers, the music is not offered in supplement to the story, as if to give the audience a taste of the composer's style, but instead it IS the story, pulling you and directing you onward to the next scene or event.Amadeus is, in short, a beautiful film of genius, obsession, betrayal, revenge and glorious-soaring-immortal music that you must see.",5,psychologically intriguing: visually and musically perfect,1058140800,"07 14, 2003",2003,1825,"['film', 'as', 'much', 'masterpiece', 'filmmaking', 'genius', 'Mozart', 'sonata', 'masterpiece', 'musical', 'genius.F', 'Murray', 'Abraham', 'Mozart', 'arch-enemy', 'Antonio', 'Salieri', 'what', 'movie', 'work', 'Peter', 'Shaffer', 'adapting', 'brilliant', 'script', 'screenplay', 'maintained', 'position', 'Salieri', 'semi-narrator', 'leading', 'audience', 'down', 'path', 'obsession', 'hear', 'music', 'Salieri', 'hear', 'Mozart', 'annoying', 'maddening', 'whinnying', 'laugh', 'only', 'Salieri', 'can', 'film', 'bit', 'Fatal', 'Attraction', 'Salieri', 'Mozart', 'music', 'genius', 'kill', '*be*', 'Mozart', 'Not', 'being', 'able', 'do', 'either', 'failure', 'own', 'mind', 'model', 'mediocrity', 'impotence', 'Abraham', 'pitiable', 'abhorent', 'What', 'do', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'hateful', 'what', 'what', 'most', 'despise', 'inability', 'achieve', 'dreams', 'also', 'pity', 'not', 'villian', 'merely', 'mortal', 'beside', 'Mozart', 'God', 'instrument', 'magic', 'flute', '.Tom', 'Hulce', 'Mozart', 'amazing', 'portrayal', 'genius', 'care', 'sympathize', 'admire', 'Mozart', 'person', 'also', 'truly', 'maddening', 'childishness', 'idiosyncracies', 'dislike', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'Salieri', 'dual', 'portrait', 'true', 'lifelike.The', 'marriage', 'Mozart', 'music', 'film', 'utterly', 'amazing', 'complete', 'One', 'could', 'truly', 'not', 'exist', 'other', 'other', 'bio-films', 'great', 'composers', 'music', 'not', 'offered', 'supplement', 'story', 'give', 'audience', 'taste', 'composer', 'style', 'instead', 'story', 'pulling', 'directing', 'onward', 'next', 'scene', 'event.Amadeus', 'short', 'beautiful', 'film', 'genius', 'obsession', 'betrayal', 'revenge', 'glorious-soaring-immortal', 'music', 'must', 'see']",N/A

I admit that I postponed watching it because it runs practically 3 hours and I never seemed to have that much spare time.

I'm certainly glad I did.  This is an outstanding movie that should please the history buffs, the costume drama buffs, and, especially, the music buffs.  The story of Mozart is compelling enough but the writer and director found an angle to view his life that reaches a level of excellence rarely seen in movie biographies.  The little-known composer; Salieri, is the protagonist and is played with excellence by F. Murray Abraham.  Frankly, I knew so little about the movie that I always thought the little-known Abraham got his Best Acting Oscar for portraying Mozart.This angle of viewing Mozart through the eyes of a jealous composer humanizes Mozart so well that a person can't help but be touched even more so by his life.  In the end, we bemoan the loss of both men's lives in the waste of a one-sided competition.  In the midst of this brilliant script is a bountiful gift of Mozart's music and it is delivered in just the right dose and just the right visual accompaniment.  Even if Mozart isn't your cup of tea, I doubt that you'll fail to be moved by his movements.  Well, I could go on and on but the point is, I am glad that I finally sat down to watch ""Amadeus"".

The terrible shame is that it is only available in Blu Ray in a director's cut. Many years ago I happened to find the theatrical release in DVD in the US (I live in Oz) and happily turfed out the director's cut. I would never buy the director's cut again no matter how magnificant the Blu Ray quality. The reason is because just about every inserted scene is vile. It changes the whole tone of the movie. When you watch the director's cut you come to appreciate how essential editing can be. The best example is in the greatest scene in any movie to depict genius. It is the moment when Madame Mozart comes up to Salieri without her husband's permission and with his original manuscripts, to apply for a teaching position. Salieri looks at the manuscripts and sees they are completely perfect - not the slightest correction in evidence. They are the first and only draft. It is as if Mozart received dictation from heaven. In marvel Salieri looks at them one after the other as we hear snatches of the brilliant music, and then he drops them through his fingers; he tramps on them as he turns away and says he can't help. The scene is completely convincing. This marvelous moment somehow is chopped into several bits in the director's cut and a whole day of activity is inserted; not only that, but the day involves him forcing his way onto Mme Mozart.

Both the production values and the music are magnificent. In 1984, it received Academy Awards for best director (Milos Forman) and leading actor (F. Murray Abraham) as well as for adapted screenplay, art direction, costume design, makeup, and sound. It was also nominated for cinematography and deserved that award also, losing out to The Killing Fields. Although Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (Tom Hulce) is the subject, the film's focus is really on Antonio Salieri (Abraham) who is offended by young Mozart's vulgarity and resentful of the fact that such an immature boor should be entrusted by God with such exceptional talent. He considers himself the victim of a cruel practical joke, although he appreciates Mozart's ""divine"" talent which only serves to exacerbate his resentment. Unlike other films such as The Red Shoes which also offers so much that is pleasing to the eye and ear, Amadeus has a complicated plot which involves equally complicated human relationships, notably Mozart's with Salieri and with his father Leopold Mozart (Roy Doltrice). The supporting cast is first-rate. As the film progresses, we realize that young Mozart is literally working himself to death as he struggles to complete a commission to compose ""Requiem,"" not realizing that Salieri is his ""benefactor."" There is so much to enjoy in this film even as Mozart's health deteriorates. What to make of Salieri? His jealousy is certainly understandable, if reprehensible. As the film draws to its sad conclusion, and as his own health deteriorates, Salieri's attitude toward Mozart seems to me ambivalent. Yes, the disapproval and resentment remain but I also sense a certain pride in his association with the young genius. The tone is bittersweet, in fact poignant as the old man realizes that Mozart's art -- not his -- will be remembered and cherished.This DVD version also provides several supplementary items which include commentaries by Milos Forman and writer Peter Shaffer as well as a behind-the-scenes 37-minute documentary, ""The Making of Amadeus.""",5,The Boy Genius and His Bitter Adversary,1059523200,"07 30, 2003",2003,2175,"['see', 'film', 'first', 'time', 'can', 'expect', 'feast', 'senses', 'least', 'terms', 'sight', 'sound', 'production', 'values', 'music', 'are', 'magnificent', '1984', 'received', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'best', 'director', 'Milos', 'Forman', 'leading', 'actor', 'F.', 'Murray', 'Abraham', 'as', 'well', 'adapted', 'screenplay', 'art', 'direction', 'costume', 'design', 'makeup', 'sound', 'was', 'also', 'nominated', 'cinematography', 'deserved', 'award', 'also', 'losing', 'out', 'Killing', 'Fields', 'Wolfgang', 'Amadeus', 'Mozart', 'Tom', 'Hulce', 'subject', 'film', 'focus', 'really', 'Antonio', 'Salieri', 'Abraham', 'who', 'offended', 'young', 'Mozart', 'vulgarity', 'resentful', 'fact', 'immature', 'boor', 'should', 'be', 'entrusted', 'God', 'such', 'exceptional', 'talent', 'victim', 'cruel', 'practical', 'joke', 'Mozart', 'divine', 'talent', 'only', 'exacerbate', 'resentment', 'other', 'films', 'such', 'Red', 'Shoes', 'also', 'so', 'much', 'pleasing', 'eye', 'ear', 'Amadeus', 'complicated', 'plot', 'equally', 'complicated', 'human', 'relationships', 'notably', 'Mozart', 'Salieri', 'father', 'Leopold', 'Mozart', 'Roy', 'Doltrice', 'supporting', 'cast', 'first-rate', 'film', 'realize', 'young', 'Mozart', 'literally', 'working', 'death', 'complete', 'commission', 'compose', 'Requiem', 'not', 'realizing', 'Salieri', 'benefactor', 'so', 'much', 'enjoy', 'film', 'even', 'Mozart', 'health', 'deteriorates', 'What', 'make', 'Salieri', 'jealousy', 'certainly', 'understandable', 'reprehensible', 'film', 'sad', 'conclusion', 'own', 'health', 'deteriorates', 'Salieri', 'attitude', 'Mozart', 'ambivalent', 'Yes', 'disapproval', 'resentment', 'remain', 'also', 'sense', 'certain', 'pride', 'association', 'young', 'genius', 'tone', 'bittersweet', 'fact', 'poignant', 'old', 'man', 'Mozart', 'art', 'not', 'will', 'be', 'remembered', 'cherished.This', 'DVD', 'version', 'also', 'several', 'supplementary', 'items', 'include', 'commentaries', 'Milos', 'Forman', 'writer', 'Peter', 'Shaffer', 'as', 'well', 'behind-the-scenes', '37-minute', 'documentary', 'Making', 'Amadeus']",N/A

102702,A1TK6R2JSC97HL,0790734060,Rottenberg's rotten book review,"[4, 4]","Amadeus"" appears to tell the story of child prodigy Mozart(Tom Hulce)really has more to do with the villainous Salieri (Best Actor Oscar winner F. Murray Abraham) who outwardly befriends Mozart but actually undermines him in every way. Inspired y ales of the younger Amadeus as a blessed musical prodigy, Salieri dedicates himself to becoming a virtuoso himself.  Years later, an accomplished and acclaimed composer, Salieri gets to meet Mozart, and discovers that the boy maestro is a vile wonk and is also (and frustratingly) divinely gifted with music.  Though setting up house in Vienna during the reign of the Musical Emperor Franz Joseph (Jeffrey Jones), and recognized for his talent, Mozart soon burns bridges with his uncompromising attitudes towards everything. Strangely, only Salieri can recognize the sheer genius in his work. Though pledging his soul to god in return for the gift of unsurpassed talent, Salieri's exposure to Mozart's music painfully shows the Italian composer how badly heaven has shortchanged him. After one read of a Mozart rough draft, Salieri consigns every crucifix in his house to the fireplace. Despite Salieri's knowledge, Mozart is underappreciated at every quarter, and Salieri's conspiracies prove redundant to hurting Mozart's career. However, when tragedy strikes Mozart, his vindictive enemy learns to direct the stricken genius towards self-destruction.This was a great story, in every way.  Though the nominal villain, the script slowly but surely makes a reluctant hero of the mediocre Salieri.  Salieri envies Mozart's genius, not his success (the story pointedly illuminates Salieri's popularity at the time and Mozart's marginal acclaim); The rivalry seems all the more poignant because Salieri seems to be the only one who can truly appreciate Amadeus's work.  Late in the film, Salieri tells the dying Mozart that he never missed any of Mozart's performances - a fact that seems hard to deny. If the flick has a villain, it's Amadeus himself - he was dedicated to his music but expended little effort in achieving it. Course, vulgar and conceited, he not only surpassed others, but seemed to do without much trouble. When first meeting Salieri at the emperor's court, the younger prodigy virtually dissects a Salieri work, then puts his own spin on it and produces a clearly superior piece of music. Outside of Salieri's presence, Mozart is openly disdainful of him.  Near the end of the film, the script works up an amazing conceit - with Salieri manipulating Mozart into composing a monumental requiem.  As Mozart's powers ebb, he musters his genius to one last masterwork, one last stab at greatness that he actually has to work for rather than await as a divine gift.""Amadeus"" is a glorious work in itself. Sumptuous music, scenes and costuming are brilliantly matched with nuanced and honest performances. Director Milos Foreman crowns this by having his cast - done up as they are in period costume and setting - speak their lines without accent or classical affectation, something that would add pretension where none was needed (and an idea that is woefully underexploited). The story, essentially a confession from a dying Salieri, is the painful elegy of the mediocre, and in this, Salieri creates a masterwork to rival Mozart's.",4,Sumptuous yet unpretentious.,1116979200,"05 25, 2005",2005,3293,"['Amadeus', 'tell', 'story', 'child', 'prodigy', 'Mozart', 'Tom', 'Hulce', 'really', 'more', 'do', 'villainous', 'Salieri', 'Best', 'Actor', 'Oscar', 'winner', 'F.', 'Murray', 'Abraham', 'who', 'outwardly', 'Mozart', 'actually', 'way', 'Inspired', 'y', 'ales', 'younger', 'Amadeus', 'blessed', 'musical', 'prodigy', 'Salieri', 'becoming', 'virtuoso', 'Years', 'later', 'accomplished', 'acclaimed', 'composer', 'Salieri', 'meet', 'Mozart', 'discovers', 'boy', 'maestro', 'vile', 'wonk', 'also', 'frustratingly', 'divinely', 'gifted', 'music', 'setting', 'up', 'house', 'Vienna', 'reign', 'Musical', 'Emperor', 'Franz', 'Joseph', 'Jeffrey', 'Jones', 'recognized', 'talent', 'Mozart', 'soon', 'bridges', 'uncompromising', 'attitudes', 'everything', 'Strangely', 'only', 'Salieri', 'can', 'recognize', 'sheer', 'genius', 'work', 'pledging', 'soul', 'god', 'return', 'gift', 'unsurpassed', 'talent', 'Salieri', 'exposure', 'Mozart', 'music', 'painfully', 'Italian', 'composer', 'how', 'badly', 'heaven', 'shortchanged', 'one', 'read', 'Mozart', 'rough', 'draft', 'Salieri', 'crucifix', 'house', 'fireplace', 'Salieri', 'knowledge', 'Mozart', 'underappreciated', 'quarter', 'Salieri', 'conspiracies', 'prove', 'redundant', 'hurting', 'Mozart', 'career', 'However', 'when', 'tragedy', 'strikes', 'Mozart', 'vindictive', 'enemy', 'direct', 'stricken', 'genius', 'self-destruction.This', 'was', 'great', 'story', 'way', 'nominal', 'villain', 'script', 'slowly', 'surely', 'reluctant', 'hero', 'mediocre', 'Salieri', 'Salieri', 'Mozart', 'genius', 'not', 'success', 'story', 'pointedly', 'Salieri', 'popularity', 'time', 'Mozart', 'marginal', 'acclaim', 'rivalry', 'more', 'poignant', 'Salieri', 'be', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'can', 'truly', 'appreciate', 'Amadeus', 'work', 'Late', 'film', 'Salieri', 'dying', 'Mozart', 'never', 'missed', 'Mozart', 'performances', 'fact', 'hard', 'deny', 'flick', 'villain', 'Amadeus', 'was', 'dedicated', 'music', 'expended', 'little', 'effort', 'achieving', 'Course', 'vulgar', 'conceited', 'not', 'only', 'surpassed', 'others', 'seemed', 'do', 'much', 'trouble', 'When', 'first', 'meeting', 'Salieri', 'emperor', 'court', 'younger', 'prodigy', 'virtually', 'Salieri', 'work', 'then', 'own', 'spin', 'clearly', 'superior', 'piece', 'music', 'Salieri', 'presence', 'Mozart', 'openly', 'disdainful', 'end', 'film', 'script', 'up', 'amazing', 'conceit', 'Salieri', 'manipulating', 'Mozart', 'composing', 'monumental', 'requiem', 'Mozart', 'powers', 'ebb', 'genius', 'one', 'last', 'masterwork', 'one', 'last', 'stab', 'greatness', 'actually', 'work', 'rather', 'await', 'divine', 'gift', 'Amadeus', 'glorious', 'work', 'Sumptuous', 'music', 'scenes', 'costuming', 'are', 'brilliantly', 'matched', 'nuanced', 'honest', 'performances', 'Director', 'Milos', 'Foreman', 'having', 'cast', 'done', 'up', 'are', 'period', 'costume', 'setting', 'speak', 'lines', 'accent', 'classical', 'affectation', 'something', 'would', 'add', 'pretension', 'where', 'none', 'was', 'needed', 'idea', 'woefully', 'underexploited', 'story', 'essentially', 'confession', 'dying', 'Salieri', 'painful', 'elegy', 'mediocre', 'Salieri', 'masterwork', 'rival', 'Mozart']",N/A

Amadeus was made into a screenplay from the play by Peter Schaffer, which made it to Broadway. At that time, it was the hottest theatrical piece. The film stars Tom Hulce as the man-child musical genius Mozart and F. Murray Abraham (Best Actor) as his jealous rival composer Antonio Salieri. The film is lush and engaging as a historical period movie and even serves as a colorful introduction to the music of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, the greatest composer of the Classical Era (1750-1820). The movie does heighten the drama and makes fictional twists on the real life of Mozart. He was a boy genius, who could play the piano as early as age 4 and who composed his first symphony, concerto and opera all by the age of 12. He was made of music. He composed quickly from brain to music score and had a charming, witty, child-like personality. He was also a party animal and an alcoholic. He died of liver complications due to his alcoholic addiction, not because Salieri had anything to do with plotting his death. Salieri was respected and much more beloved in his time than Mozart. Salieri even taught such great names as Beethoven, Schubert and Franz Liszt. He lived in luxury while Mozart struggled financially and lived from hand to mouth and had no reason to be jealous even if Mozart's music was far superior to his.F. Murray Abraham really delivers the performance of his life as the villainous and bitter Salieri. Salieri is so jealous of Mozart that he renounces his Catholic faith and burns a crucifix. He feels God has abandoned him because he never fulfilled his prayer of making him the most famous composer in history. Salieri makes it his life-long goal to destroy Mozart himself. His influence over the Imperial Court in Vienna, Austria, and together with the efforts of the jealous team of librettist and music directors, he sees to it that Mozart's operas, such as Le Nozze Di Figaro and Don Giovanni not enjoy the success it rightfully deserves. The film, you see, is more about Salieri than it is about Mozart. In the end, Mozart has the laught laugh as Salieri comes to believe he has killed Mozart (with the heavy burden of making him write his own Requiem Mass) and is instituted in an insane asylum. The performances are excellent, the script is terrific and the look of the film authentically 18th century. Music entirely composed by Mozart, including his Piano Concerto 20 and 22, Serenade Gran Partita For Winds, and even his German operas Abduction From The Seraglio (Die Entfurung Aus Dem Serail) and Die Zauberflote (The Magic Flute).

102707,ANA2PVMARGY8H,0790734060,"Sarah ""Bookworm/cat person""","[3, 3]","This movie is, to quote Jack Mathews' USA Today write-up, ""about as close to perfection as movies get.""  I say that about the original theatre release.  While I enjoyed the special features and the digitally restored and remastered picture and sound of the Director's Cut, I think that there were good reasons why Milos Forman and crew deleted the ""20 minutes of never-before-seen footage.""  The pacing drags, but even more distressing, we see Herr Mozart reduced to giving ""canine concerts"" and submitting to other forms of degradation.  In the original release, Mozart rarely raises his voice against Constanze; in this version, he's quite irritable.  The Director's Cut does explain why Constanze later in the movie openly dislikes and distrusts Salieri.  In the original release, I had accounted for her otherwise inexplicable change in attitute as woman's instinct. The Director's Cut does allow for greater character development of Salieri.  For example, he struggles more with his belief system before turning his back on it. Salieri's jealousy prompts him to go out of his way to sabotage Mozart financially, spreading slander so Mozart will be unable to attract pupils.  And we see that Salieri has quite the sweet tooth as he's munching on some delicacy in most scenes. (Elizabeth Berridge comments that she almost got sick when she had to eat ""the nipples of Venus"" (marzipan) during several takes of the scene where she solicits Salieri's help to secure Mozart an important teaching position.)The reason I'm still giving the Director's Cut 5 stars is because I love this movie and am glad that we fans have an alternate (though less ""perfect"") version of this cinematic masterpiece.  The cast interviews (20 or so years after making the movie) were  a pleasure to watch, and we're given lots of inside information. For example, Tom Hulce and F. Murray Abraham contrived an off-screen animosity to keep up the spirit of their characters during filming. Elizabeth Berridge laughs about the reason why she was chosen over the other final contender for Constanze:  she was ""less attractive,"" and therefore, more believable as the ""street kid"" the movie depicts Stanze to be. (Historically, Constanze was quite the mezzo soprano; this film makes no reference to Stanze's singing nor to the fact that Mozart more than once composed with his wife in mind.)During the crew interviews, Milos Forman remarks that Mozart's music became the third main character, an entity onto itself. Milos and Peter Shaffer speak about being humbled by this third character and how they were both overwhelmed by the music's beauty.Even if this movie betrays several glitches in historical accuracy, it is both moving and entertaining. I first saw this movie when I was about 11 and at the time, had rarely (if ever) heard Mozart's music (now I'm a full-blown fan).

102709,A2PNTEDGMOLMOY,0790734060,Scott Schiefelbein,"[4, 4]","&quot;Amadeus&quot; dares to tell the story of mediocrity, and in the words of the mediocre some astounding truths are told.Essentially narrated by the aged and suicidal Salieri in a &quot;confession&quot; to a young priest in the &quot;present day&quot; (actually 1823), former musical giant (composer of the &quot;greatest opera yet written&quot; that has been consigned to the ashbin of history) and now a wrinkled has-been, &quot;Amadeus&quot; ponders the plight of an ambitious man (Salieri) confronted by genius that he can never defeat on its own terms.  According to &quot;Amadeus,&quot; the results of this clash are not pretty.The film opens spectacularly, with Salieri screaming &quot;Mozart&quot; against a black screen.  Soon we see Salieri, blood gushing from his self-slashed throat, being whisked through the streets of Vienna as the city dances and whirls to Mozart's exhilirating Symphony No. 25 in G Minor (don't worry -- you'll recognize it).  With an amazing economy, the film, directed by Milos Forman (and adapted  Paul Shaffer from his own stage work) establishes a world of wondrous palaces, hyper-elaborate dress, and astounding music.  No mere costume drama, &quot;Amadeus&quot; drops the viewer deep into the late 18th century in Vienna, then one of the most powerful cities in Europe and a cultural touchstone for the Western world.  This is the city to which all composers flock.Salieri, with his crabbed hands and scratchy voice, tells of his early years, when he promises his soul to God in return for the ability to make music to honor God. He pledges his industry, his chastity, and his eternal devotion.  And, wonder of wonders, his dad (a merchant with no ear for music) dies, choking to death at lunch!  So Salieri is free to pursue his love of music, and it appears that God has granted Salieri his wish -- Salieri rises to become Court Composer for Emperor Joseph II (Jeffrey Jones).Well regarded, Salieri has his world turned upside down by the arrival of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (Tom Hulce, in an inspired casting coup).  Vulgar, impulsive, hedonistic, and supremely talented, Mozart's reputation as a genius has preceded him, but Salieri is horrified to see that Mozart is (almost) as concerned with debauchery as his music.  Even more horrifying, Salieri realizes that Mozart is more talented than he -- reading over Mozart's pages, Salieri groans, &quot;It was like he was taking dictation from God.&quot;Why, God, why?  Salieri cannot fathom why God would make this creature the vehicle for such talent . . . talent that only Salieri seems to appreciate.  Mozart is popular with the masses, but cannot make a big splash with the Court . . . in part because the Emperor, who defines taste for the Court, has no ear for music.  When the Emperor yawns during one of Mozart's performances, Mozart is doomed.  The Emperor also has some priceless advice for Mozart -- don't use so many notes, becuase the human ear can only hear so many notes before it gets tired!Driven to despair by the continued genius flowing from Mozart's pen, Salieri rejects God and vows to destroy God's creature.  What follows is a descent into madness for both Salieri and Mozart.  Without getting overly sentimental, Forman and Shaffer spin a tale of surpassing beauty (Mozart's music) and tragedy (Mozart's death).Ultimately, Salieri proclaims that he is the champion of mediocrity everywhere.  As he is whisked away from the shell-shocked priest, Salieri absolves the various patients in his insane asylum, he also absolves the audience (who cannot help but feel mediocre in the face of Mozart's genius?).  In a pitch-perfect note, as the screen dissolves to final black, we again hear Mozart's aggravating, infuriating high-pitched giggle, and we know that it will forever haunt Salieri.&quot;Amadeus&quot; throws us into the mania of composition for both Mozart and Salieri, the world of court intrigues, and the triumphs and agonies of success and failure for composers.  We understand Salieri's torture as his music grows fainter as Mozart's popularity soars -- even after Mozart's death.  This is a powerful film with a surprisingly dark theme, but it is required viewing for any fan of classical music.The soundtrack, by Sir Neville Mariner of the Academy of St. Martin-in-the-Fields, is astounding, and will have you rushing out to buy Mozart CDs as soon as the movie is over.",5,F.

What -- THE MAGIC FLUTE is a  &quot;quiet&quot;, &quot;subtle&quot;  piece?  Spare me.Here's the deal:  certain works of art are subtle; others are not.  Mozart's art was often both.

Because one can imagine what a muddied pile of dreck this story would've been if someone like, say, Alain Resnais directed this thing.  Certain stories demand the bold, popular approach.My point being, snobs need not apply in regards to this wonderful movie.

102712,A36QYTMMJ0O2IZ,0790734060,Sean Pasek,"[5, 6]","Despite the many protests from scholars and Mozart fans alike regarding the accuracies or inaccuracies of this film to Mozart's true biography, the viewer still cannot help but be moved, inspired, and entertained all in one fell swoop!One of the marks of a true classic is something that stands up to the test of time.  Amadeus fits the definition as much as Casablanca, Gone With the Wind, and many other films that are still watched and discussed to this day.Amadeus celebrates one of the true musical geniuses ever to walk the Earth.  Compare the number of works of Mozart to the Beatles, and the Beatles throughout their career would barely scratch the surface of Mozart's over 600 works.  What makes this fact even more compelling, is the number of his works that are considered by many scholars, critics, and fans alike as some of the best music ever written.This film is a tour de force as far as acting goes.  F. Murray Abraham gives one of the best performances in film history as the likeable, yet envious Antonio Salieri who finds his own works to always be secondary to Mozart.  The irony regarding the depiction of these two composers in this film is that Salieri is shown to be the only one who truly marveled and understood the genius behind the music of Mozart. Salieri represents the ""normal"" man, or as he says at the end of the film, ""I represent mediocrities everywhere.""Not to be out-done, Tom Hulce is fantastic as Mozart.  Hulce himself practiced on the piano for four hours each day so that he would appear convincing on film.  Despite showcasing Mozart with obvious arrogance and lack of humility, Hulce portrays Mozart with an almost child-like quality.  The cackling laugh of his still brings a smile every time you hear it.Perhaps the beauty about Mozart's character is that he isn't a ""pleaser.""  Salieri has taken drastic steps to please himself before God, who he hopes will embue him with the ability to write ""perfect"" music.  And yet, he's astounded by Mozart who hasn't any humility, who isn't chaste, and who seems to repeatedly do things that would fly directly in the face of God.  It is this that Salieri takes exception to, and not necessarily the person of Mozart.If nothing else, Amadeus seems to ""burst the bubble"" as far as our views on what a ""genius"" should look like, or how they should act.  This is shown when Salieri first sees Mozart.  He's looking for an inspiring-looking man, but insteads finds an immature and selfish young man who could care less about the opinions of those around him.Perhaps the ""lesson"" here is that it doesn't matter how Mozart is depicted on film.  We can argue and complain about how the man truly was, but no one can ever dispute the genius behind his music, and isn't that what truly matters?",5,One of the Best Contemporary Films Ever Made,1162080000,"10 29, 2006",2006,2773,"['many', 'protests', 'scholars', 'Mozart', 'fans', 'alike', 'regarding', 'accuracies', 'inaccuracies', 'film', 'Mozart', 'true', 'biography', 'viewer', 'still', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'be', 'moved', 'inspired', 'entertained', 'one', 'fell', 'swoop', 'One', 'marks', 'true', 'classic', 'something', 'up', 'test', 'time', 'definition', 'as', 'much', 'Casablanca', 'Gone', 'Wind', 'many', 'other', 'films', 'are', 'still', 'watched', 'discussed', 'day.Amadeus', 'one', 'true', 'musical', 'geniuses', 'ever', 'walk', 'Earth', 'Compare', 'number', 'works', 'Mozart', 'Beatles', 'Beatles', 'career', 'would', 'barely', 'scratch', 'surface', 'Mozart', '600', 'works', 'What', 'fact', 'even', 'more', 'compelling', 'number', 'works', 'are', 'considered', 'many', 'scholars', 'critics', 'fans', 'alike', 'best', 'music', 'ever', 'written.This', 'film', 'tour', 'de', 'force', 'as', 'far', 'acting', 'F.', 'Murray', 'Abraham', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'film', 'history', 'likeable', 'yet', 'envious', 'Antonio', 'Salieri', 'who', 'own', 'works', 'always', 'be', 'secondary', 'Mozart', 'irony', 'regarding', 'depiction', 'two', 'composers', 'film', 'Salieri', 'shown', 'be', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'marveled', 'understood', 'genius', 'music', 'Mozart', 'Salieri', 'normal', 'man', 'end', 'film', 'represent', 'mediocrities', 'everywhere', 'Not', 'be', 'out-done', 'Tom', 'Hulce', 'fantastic', 'Mozart', 'Hulce', 'practiced', 'piano', 'four', 'hours', 'day', 'so', 'would', 'appear', 'convincing', 'film', 'showcasing', 'Mozart', 'obvious', 'arrogance', 'lack', 'humility', 'Hulce', 'Mozart', 'almost', 'child-like', 'quality', 'cackling', 'laugh', 'still', 'smile', 'time', 'hear', 'beauty', 'Mozart', 'character', ""n't"", 'pleaser', 'Salieri', 'taken', 'drastic', 'steps', 'please', 'God', 'who', 'will', 'embue', 'ability', 'write', 'perfect', 'music', 'yet', 'astounded', 'Mozart', 'who', ""n't"", 'humility', 'who', ""n't"", 'chaste', 'who', 'repeatedly', 'do', 'things', 'would', 'fly', 'directly', 'face', 'God', 'Salieri', 'exception', 'not', 'necessarily', 'person', 'Mozart.If', 'nothing', 'else', 'Amadeus', 'burst', 'bubble', 'as', 'far', 'views', 'what', 'genius', 'should', 'look', 'how', 'should', 'act', 'shown', 'when', 'Salieri', 'first', 'Mozart', 'looking', 'inspiring-looking', 'man', 'immature', 'selfish', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'could', 'care', 'less', 'opinions', 'lesson', 'here', ""n't"", 'matter', 'how', 'Mozart', 'depicted', 'film', 'can', 'argue', 'complain', 'how', 'man', 'truly', 'was', 'one', 'can', 'ever', 'dispute', 'genius', 'music', ""n't"", 'what', 'truly', 'matters']",N/A

It doesn't seem like QUITE enough to warrent the second disc.Second, even though I love most of the extra scenes added back in... the one where Mozart (drunk) returns to 'Dog man' to beg for patronage... is just too painfully pathetic and completely unnecessary. It doesn't even match-up well to how Mozart was portrayed immediately before or after, and sticks out like a sore-spot on the movie.

Salieri is played by F Murray Abraham, who undoubtably steals the acting honours, if only because his performance is always entirely believeable, if not neccessarily any more factual. Tom Hulse gives a fine performance as Mozart, but I always felt that there was more artistic licence in his performance than in Abrahams.The music is superbly performed and the operatic settings deserve special mention. Certainly this film gives you every opportunity to appreciate the extraordinary talent that Mozart was blessed with. Whether the play the film is based on is in any way factual is unknown to me but this is an irrelevance.

What I do want to touch on is the new ""Director's Cut"":First off, the transfer is excellent. Deep blacks. Not too much color in this film except when we are in the emperor's court, the opera stage and the robes of the archbishop, but in those more lit scenes the colors are vibrant. This is not going to be like Fifth Element as far as sharpness, but it pleases the eye. But then, the original Amadeus had a fine transfer as well.As for the extra scenes: they fit into the whole seemlessly. These are not scenes that were cut because they didn't contribute to the story; rather these were cut due for reasons of duration and to avoid an R rating (really, there's only Constanza's breasts that threatened to put Amadeus over the edge--our rating system is stupid). The story is better than ever, and the quality of the footage is in no way inferior to the rest of the film. Seemless cut.5.1: nice sound. Not too much use of the rear channels outside of soundtrack (enough reason there!) and applause during performances, but this is certainly a treat nonetheless. the LFE .1 channel got some good use. During Don Giovanni the heavy footfalls of Wolfi's Don/Father come booming to life.The documentary is one hour, not 37 minutes as stated on the amazon description. It is excellent!!! Did you know that Meg Tilly was to play Constanza? No footage of her screentest but there is pics of her in costume. Beautiful. Milos talking about returning to his homeland after becoming declared persona non grata is worth watching.The commentary: I wasn't able to get more than 20 minutes into it. A shame that Milos couldn't be accompanied by Zaentz or Hulce or the best would be F. Murray Abraham (fat chance on that one), or any minor character or any of the dogs or even the cat from the first scene...anyone would have been better than Schaeffer. All he could say was ""That's Right"" or simply repeat the last few words of whatever Milos said. What a bore. But as bad as that may be I'd still pay twice the cost for this cut. BRILLIANT BRILLIANT!!!The trailor: great to see how such a great movie can have such a stupid trailor.And then there's the awards. The usual.All in all, this dvd is fantastic. Fully deserving of it's 8 awards. A shame that Hulce didn't get more recognition. many contend that he overplayed his part, but it's his presence that saves it from being a depressing epic.

I am somewhat at a loss to describe my experience.The most impressive part of this version is the added scenes throughout the film.  It is for these scenes alone that you should see this cut.  It is now apparent so much was edited out during its initial theatrical release that scenes were not properly connected and the characters' motives not fully explained.  They are now.  I won't go into specifics but one of the additions explains the relationship between Salieri and Mozart's wife and why she disliked him so much.The quality of the print is fine with no signs of aging.Here comes my dilemma.  The sound quality is horrible.  Being a film of Mozart there is music and lots of it.  In fact,  the soundtrack  plays a crucial and intricate role.  So what happened to this version?  One way to descibe it is early digital- harsh, flat as a pancake, and 'nails on the blackboard' irritating.

I saw this film in a theatre in England as a boy and it was one of the highlights of my movie going youth. And yes, I'm that old ... or young. Take your pick, dear reader.So, what did become of Tom Hulce? He was absolutely shocking in this movie as a portrayal of one of the greatest composers / humans ever to live. Well, for the record Tom Hulce, kind of decided that it must be cool to put on some weight, because that's exactly what he went and did. He also became a producer doing projects of his own liking. He was also recently inStranger Than Fiction, but if you don't look fast you just might miss him.Regarding the film ... a lot of viewers often come away with the belief that this is an intensely accurate story about the life of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, which in fact it is a story about Mozart, but it is not all that accurate. This is a movie that was based upon a stage play called ""Mozart and Salieri"". What it does capture though, is period set design, wardrobe and atmosphere and it does it so well that any story told within this shell could be utterly believable and engrossing.However, all these things aside, this is an incredibly strong film to say the least and one of my all time favourites.The musicis beautifully woven throughout this to carry you back to the life of a would-be madman and reckless drunkard. It's a blessing that he did not wallow in obscurity and is still esteemed as highly as he is today, for WAM, so deserves it.If you are the type of person that prefers accurate portrayals in their bio-pic features, then you should probably seeImmortal Beloved, as it is about as true of an account of that Composers life as you're going to see and is wonderfully captured by Gary Oldman.",5,What ever happened to Tom Hulce? ...,1203897600,"02 25, 2008",2008,1886,"['what', 'can', 'really', 'be', 'said', 'film', 'review', '24', 'years', 'film', 'first', 'release', 'First', 'can', 'not', 'believe', 'already', 'been', 'long', 'saw', 'film', 'theatre', 'England', 'boy', 'was', 'one', 'highlights', 'movie', 'going', 'youth', 'yes', ""'m"", 'old', 'young', 'Take', 'pick', 'dear', 'reader.So', 'what', 'did', 'become', 'Tom', 'Hulce', 'was', 'absolutely', 'shocking', 'movie', 'portrayal', 'one', 'greatest', 'composers', '/', 'humans', 'ever', 'live', 'Well', 'record', 'Tom', 'Hulce', 'kind', 'decided', 'must', 'be', 'cool', 'put', 'weight', 'exactly', 'what', 'went', 'did', 'also', 'became', 'producer', 'doing', 'projects', 'own', 'liking', 'was', 'also', 'recently', 'inStranger', 'Than', 'Fiction', 'do', ""n't"", 'look', 'fast', 'just', 'might', 'miss', 'him.Regarding', 'film', 'lot', 'viewers', 'often', 'come', 'away', 'belief', 'intensely', 'accurate', 'story', 'life', 'Wolfgang', 'Amadeus', 'Mozart', 'fact', 'story', 'Mozart', 'not', 'accurate', 'movie', 'was', 'based', 'stage', 'play', 'called', 'Mozart', 'Salieri', 'What', 'capture', 'period', 'set', 'design', 'wardrobe', 'atmosphere', 'so', 'well', 'story', 'told', 'shell', 'could', 'be', 'utterly', 'believable', 'engrossing.However', 'things', 'aside', 'incredibly', 'strong', 'film', 'say', 'least', 'one', 'time', 'favourites.The', 'musicis', 'beautifully', 'woven', 'carry', 'back', 'life', 'would-be', 'madman', 'reckless', 'drunkard', 'blessing', 'did', 'not', 'wallow', 'obscurity', 'still', 'esteemed', 'as', 'highly', 'today', 'WAM', 'so', 'it.If', 'are', 'type', 'person', 'prefers', 'accurate', 'portrayals', 'bio-pic', 'features', 'then', 'should', 'probably', 'seeImmortal', 'Beloved', 'true', 'account', 'Composers', 'life', ""'re"", 'going', 'see', 'wonderfully', 'captured', 'Gary', 'Oldman']",N/A
102726,A2H3JURQZOHVMB,0790734060,"Stella Carrier ""joyfulwoman2078""","[3, 4]","""Amadeus"" is a movie about the discussion of Mozart's life as told from a colleague's point of view. Tom Hulce convincingly plays an energetic Mozart, who is very much focused on his craft.  Fahrid Murray Abraham cleverly plays fellow classical musician Salieri.  Salieri holds Mozart in high regard.  The movie displays the why of this admiration, as seen through the many good musical performances in the movie.  Salieri longs for the same talent, and the beginning of the movie provides a very compelling preface as to the origins of this respect.  The movie ""Amadeus"" is told in such a way that it would be easy to understand things from Salieri's point of view.  I was watching the movie,and thinking ""How could he?"" (in reference to Salieri).  On the other hand, I found myself admiring Mozart's musical compositions that were performed in the movie.  I also felt empathy for the circumstances leading to Salieri's wish to enjoy the same popularity as Mozart.  It is understandable that others may watch ""Amadeus"" and see the relationship between Salieri and Mozart through a different perspective.

102728,A2VP7JOT3K7PFM,0790734060,"Stephen Pletko ""Uncle Stevie""","[23, 26]","+++++This 160 minute movie (best picture Oscar winner in 1984) chronicles the last ten years of the Austrian composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (1756-1791), played by Tom Hulce (who was nominated for an Oscar for this role).This movie's entire story revolves around the conjectured intense jealous relationship between the mediocre composer Antonio Salieri (1750-1825), played by F. Murray Abraham (who won an Oscar for this role) and the genius composer Mozart.  It is theorized that this jealously led Salieri to murder Mozart.  (In reality, this is one theory of many as to why Mozart died so young.)Other relationships to watch are those between Mozart and his wife, Constanze (Elizabeth Berridge); between Mozart and his father, Leopold (Roy Dotrice); and finally between Mozart and Emperor Joseph ll (Jeffery Jones).What's amazing about this movie is its accuracy (which is surprising for a movie usually takes many ""artistic liberties"").  Here are some examples.  Mozart was a child prodigy.  He did suffer financial difficulties after he was dismissed from his paid employment with the Archbishop of Salzburg and moved to Vienna.  Mozart married Constanze Weber in Vienna.  His father did have a disastrous visit to his newlywed son's home.  Mozart made the bulk of his income in Vienna by giving concerts and working freelance.  He did delight in dancing, billiards, and crude jokes.The character most interesting in this movie is Salieri which Abraham portrays with great skill.  Salieri is aware of Mozart's musical genius (despite other people who do not understand Mozart's music since they claim it has ""too many notes"" and it makes ""too many demands on the Royal ear"").  Thus Salieri becomes very jealous of Mozart's genius but Mozart is unaware of this and even regards Salieri as a friend.Salieri is portrayed as a person who believes in God.  The irony here is that Mozart's middle Latin name of Amadeus means ""he who loves God.""  So Salieri eventually sees God as mocking him through Mozart.  This causes Salieri to renounce his belief in God since God did not bless him with the same musical genius as Mozart.Mozart admits that he is a ""vulgar man but his music is not.""  Hulce as Mozart does a good job portraying this vulgarity.  History tells us that Mozart had an odd laugh and Hulce does a great job recreating this laugh throughout the movie.What's really enjoyable about this movie is Mozart's music.  Music flowed from Mozart unceasingly and the movie shows this well.  This movie gives a good representative sample of his more than 600 musical compositions especially his opera, piano (his favorite instrument), and symphonic (he wrote more than forty symphonies) music.Mozart's music is not just used as background music in the movie but is an essential ingredient that adds to each scene.  For example, when Mozart dies, his uncompleted choral piece, the Requiem (which he was commissioned to write) is used to heighten the dramatic and emotional impact of his funeral.  It's almost as if he intentionally wrote the Requiem for his own death.Finally, this movie is visually stunning especially with respect to the interior of theatres.  I especially remember the large chandeliers.  All rooms in homes and palaces seem to be filled with authentic period artifacts (such as paintings and antique furniture).In conclusion, don't miss this movie!!  It gives you a chance to experience the life of a musical genius through the eyes of a mediocre composer who described the music of this genius as the ""Voice of God.""+++++",5,Musical Genius Versus Musical Mediocrity,1072915200,"01 1, 2004",2004,3546,"['+++++This', '160', 'minute', 'movie', 'best', 'picture', 'Oscar', 'winner', '1984', 'last', 'ten', 'years', 'Austrian', 'composer', 'Wolfgang', 'Amadeus', 'Mozart', '1756-1791', 'played', 'Tom', 'Hulce', 'who', 'was', 'nominated', 'Oscar', 'role', 'movie', 'entire', 'story', 'revolves', 'conjectured', 'intense', 'jealous', 'relationship', 'mediocre', 'composer', 'Antonio', 'Salieri', '1750-1825', 'played', 'F.', 'Murray', 'Abraham', 'who', 'won', 'Oscar', 'role', 'genius', 'composer', 'Mozart', 'theorized', 'jealously', 'led', 'Salieri', 'murder', 'Mozart', 'reality', 'one', 'theory', 'many', 'why', 'Mozart', 'died', 'so', 'young', 'Other', 'relationships', 'watch', 'are', 'Mozart', 'wife', 'Constanze', 'Elizabeth', 'Berridge', 'Mozart', 'father', 'Leopold', 'Roy', 'Dotrice', 'finally', 'Mozart', 'Emperor', 'Joseph', 'll', 'Jeffery', 'Jones', '.What', 'amazing', 'movie', 'accuracy', 'surprising', 'movie', 'usually', 'many', 'artistic', 'liberties', 'Here', 'are', 'examples', 'Mozart', 'was', 'child', 'prodigy', 'did', 'suffer', 'financial', 'difficulties', 'was', 'dismissed', 'paid', 'employment', 'Archbishop', 'Salzburg', 'moved', 'Vienna', 'Mozart', 'married', 'Constanze', 'Weber', 'Vienna', 'father', 'did', 'have', 'disastrous', 'visit', 'newlywed', 'son', 'home', 'Mozart', 'made', 'bulk', 'income', 'Vienna', 'giving', 'concerts', 'working', 'freelance', 'did', 'delight', 'dancing', 'billiards', 'crude', 'jokes.The', 'character', 'most', 'interesting', 'movie', 'Salieri', 'Abraham', 'great', 'skill', 'Salieri', 'aware', 'Mozart', 'musical', 'genius', 'other', 'people', 'who', 'do', 'not', 'understand', 'Mozart', 'music', 'claim', 'too', 'many', 'notes', 'too', 'many', 'demands', 'Royal', 'ear', 'Thus', 'Salieri', 'very', 'jealous', 'Mozart', 'genius', 'Mozart', 'unaware', 'even', 'regards', 'Salieri', 'friend.Salieri', 'portrayed', 'person', 'who', 'God', 'irony', 'here', 'Mozart', 'middle', 'Latin', 'name', 'Amadeus', 'who', 'God', 'So', 'Salieri', 'eventually', 'God', 'mocking', 'Mozart', 'Salieri', 'renounce', 'belief', 'God', 'God', 'did', 'not', 'bless', 'same', 'musical', 'genius', 'Mozart.Mozart', 'vulgar', 'man', 'music', 'not', 'Hulce', 'Mozart', 'good', 'job', 'portraying', 'vulgarity', 'History', 'Mozart', 'had', 'odd', 'laugh', 'Hulce', 'great', 'job', 'recreating', 'laugh', 'movie.What', 'really', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'Mozart', 'music', 'Music', 'flowed', 'Mozart', 'unceasingly', 'movie', 'well', 'movie', 'good', 'representative', 'sample', 'more', '600', 'musical', 'compositions', 'especially', 'opera', 'piano', 'favorite', 'instrument', 'symphonic', 'wrote', 'more', 'forty', 'symphonies', 'music.Mozart', 'music', 'not', 'just', 'used', 'background', 'music', 'movie', 'essential', 'ingredient', 'scene', 'example', 'when', 'Mozart', 'uncompleted', 'choral', 'piece', 'Requiem', 'was', 'commissioned', 'write', 'used', 'heighten', 'dramatic', 'emotional', 'impact', 'funeral', 'almost', 'intentionally', 'wrote', 'Requiem', 'own', 'death.Finally', 'movie', 'visually', 'stunning', 'especially', 'respect', 'interior', 'theatres', 'especially', 'remember', 'large', 'chandeliers', 'rooms', 'homes', 'palaces', 'seem', 'be', 'filled', 'authentic', 'period', 'artifacts', 'such', 'paintings', 'antique', 'furniture', '.In', 'conclusion', 'do', ""n't"", 'miss', 'movie', 'chance', 'experience', 'life', 'musical', 'genius', 'eyes', 'mediocre', 'composer', 'who', 'described', 'music', 'genius', 'Voice', 'God', '+++++']",N/A

102736,A2J00K3J9KPQD3,0790734060,The Dread Pirate Pastor Muppets,"[1, 1]","""That doesn't really work, does it?"" says Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, as he plays a march of welcome written by court composer Antonio Salieri. Within a minute, he has turned a labored little tune which took much time and effort into what would become the ""Non piu andrai"" March from his seemingly controversial opera The Marriage of Figaro. As he ends it with a childish three-note melody, he produces a high-pitched giggle which will ring in both Salieri's and the audiences' ears forever.The bitterness and jealousy of Salieri towards Mozart is the subject of Milos Forman's brilliant film ""Amadeus"", which explores not just the greatness of Mozart's music but the mediocrity of Salieri's. One of the most enduring lines in the movie is Salieri's question to the priest who is hearing his confession: ""Why would God put the lust to compose in my body and then deny me the talent?"" He recognizes Mozart not only as a miraculous composer, but also as an undeserving brat.One of the most interesting sequences in the movie is when Salieri goes to a concert of Mozart's in Vienna to seek him out. He notices a young man and woman rolling around on the floor speaking obscenities backwards. But when the young man hears his music being played without his presence, Salieri immediately begins to despise Mozart, describing him as a dirty creature.There are several strengths to ""Amadeus"": the strongest is the performance by F. Murray Abraham as the jealous court composer. Every movement by Abraham is a master stroke of acting. He won the Academy Award for Best Actor as this role, and it is no surprise. As a man who loved music but simply lacked the talent, Salieri was a man of incredible depth with several conflicts.Playing opposite Abraham is Tom Hulce as one of the greatest geniuses of all time. But as ""Amadeus"" shows, Mozart did not take his talent for granted. Instead, he used it as a crutch as he highly criticized and made fun of other composers. The funniest scene in the movie (did I happen to mention that this movie is hilarious) is when Salieri is spying on Mozart at a party where the latter is being asked requests to play music from other composers. After he performs the music of Bach, he turns down requests for such composers as Handel, giving the excuse ""I don't like him"". In disguise, Salieri requests for his own music. Mozart describes it as a challenge to play Salieri. But as he plays, he starts making fun of Salieri's physical output and the hard work that the court composer put into making the music.Another one of my favorite elements of the film is the costume design. The costume as well as the art direction and set pieces help to make ""Amadeus"" one of the greatest films set in 18th century Europe.But aside from the comic humor and design, this is a film about forgiveness. As we are shown in the beginning scenes, Salieri feels that Mozart's death was his fault. His flashback is the amazing story of how he knew Mozart and how the music has affected him.The scene where Salieri assists Mozart in writing the Requiem Mass is the best in the movie. As Mozart's health decreases, he struggles to get his last thoughts on the music transcribed by Salieri. When his wife and son return home in the morning, Mozart is barely breathing and as pale as ever. His wife locks away the music and forces Salieri out. As this happens, Mozart dies.As we see Salieri's character develop, we see that in time he grows to be content with the fact that his music will never match up to Mozart's. He deems himself ""the patron saint of mediocrity.""",5,Great Movies- Amadeus (1984),1341187200,"07 2, 2012",2012,3567,"[""n't"", 'really', 'work', 'Wolfgang', 'Amadeus', 'Mozart', 'march', 'welcome', 'written', 'court', 'composer', 'Antonio', 'Salieri', 'minute', 'turned', 'labored', 'little', 'tune', 'took', 'much', 'time', 'effort', 'what', 'would', 'become', 'Non', 'piu', 'andrai', 'March', 'seemingly', 'controversial', 'Marriage', 'Figaro', 'childish', 'three-note', 'melody', 'high-pitched', 'giggle', 'will', 'ring', 'Salieri', 'audiences', 'ears', 'forever.The', 'bitterness', 'jealousy', 'Salieri', 'towards', 'Mozart', 'subject', 'Milos', 'Forman', 'brilliant', 'film', 'Amadeus', 'not', 'just', 'greatness', 'Mozart', 'music', 'mediocrity', 'Salieri', 'One', 'most', 'enduring', 'lines', 'movie', 'Salieri', 'question', 'priest', 'who', 'hearing', 'confession', 'Why', 'would', 'God', 'put', 'lust', 'compose', 'body', 'then', 'deny', 'talent', 'Mozart', 'not', 'only', 'miraculous', 'composer', 'also', 'undeserving', 'brat.One', 'most', 'interesting', 'sequences', 'movie', 'when', 'Salieri', 'concert', 'Mozart', 'Vienna', 'seek', 'out', 'young', 'man', 'woman', 'rolling', 'around', 'floor', 'speaking', 'obscenities', 'backwards', 'when', 'young', 'man', 'music', 'being', 'played', 'presence', 'Salieri', 'immediately', 'despise', 'Mozart', 'describing', 'dirty', 'are', 'several', 'strengths', 'Amadeus', 'strongest', 'performance', 'F.', 'Murray', 'Abraham', 'jealous', 'court', 'composer', 'movement', 'Abraham', 'master', 'stroke', 'acting', 'won', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Best', 'Actor', 'role', 'surprise', 'man', 'who', 'loved', 'music', 'simply', 'lacked', 'talent', 'Salieri', 'was', 'man', 'incredible', 'depth', 'several', 'conflicts.Playing', 'opposite', 'Abraham', 'Tom', 'Hulce', 'one', 'greatest', 'geniuses', 'time', 'Amadeus', 'shows', 'Mozart', 'did', 'not', 'take', 'talent', 'granted', 'Instead', 'used', 'crutch', 'highly', 'criticized', 'made', 'fun', 'other', 'composers', 'funniest', 'scene', 'movie', 'did', 'happen', 'mention', 'movie', 'hilarious', 'when', 'Salieri', 'spying', 'Mozart', 'party', 'where', 'latter', 'being', 'asked', 'requests', 'play', 'music', 'other', 'composers', 'music', 'Bach', 'down', 'requests', 'such', 'composers', 'Handel', 'giving', 'excuse', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'disguise', 'Salieri', 'requests', 'own', 'music', 'Mozart', 'challenge', 'play', 'Salieri', 'making', 'fun', 'Salieri', 'physical', 'output', 'hard', 'work', 'court', 'composer', 'put', 'making', 'music.Another', 'one', 'favorite', 'elements', 'film', 'costume', 'design', 'costume', 'as', 'well', 'art', 'direction', 'set', 'pieces', 'help', 'make', 'Amadeus', 'one', 'greatest', 'films', 'set', '18th', 'century', 'Europe.But', 'aside', 'comic', 'humor', 'design', 'film', 'forgiveness', 'are', 'shown', 'beginning', 'scenes', 'Salieri', 'Mozart', 'death', 'was', 'fault', 'flashback', 'amazing', 'story', 'how', 'knew', 'Mozart', 'how', 'music', 'affected', 'him.The', 'scene', 'where', 'Salieri', 'Mozart', 'writing', 'Requiem', 'Mass', 'best', 'movie', 'Mozart', 'health', 'decreases', 'get', 'last', 'thoughts', 'music', 'transcribed', 'Salieri', 'When', 'wife', 'son', 'return', 'home', 'morning', 'Mozart', 'barely', 'breathing', 'as', 'pale', 'ever', 'wife', 'away', 'music', 'forces', 'Salieri', 'out', 'Mozart', 'see', 'Salieri', 'character', 'develop', 'see', 'time', 'be', 'content', 'fact', 'music', 'will', 'never', 'match', 'up', 'Mozart', 'patron', 'saint', 'mediocrity']",N/A
102737,A31ACI0E88ORDE,0790734060,The Great White Father,"[0, 0]","That's an honest question.  There is so much to dislike that I don't understand either why this won the Academy Award nor why this gets any positive reviews--and I've only seen the original release, not the director's cut.  I've seen reviews that say the director's cut ruined the original.  I ask: what was there to ruin?  The only slack I feel I can cut the makers of this film is that the concept is not unique or original--but still, why perpetuate it?  Honestly, the only reason I bothered to watch this film (I checked it out at the library because I refused to buy it) was because I was hoping against hope that there was something I was missing, that I was being prejudiced against the film without even watching it--and I still don't feel like I found the good in it that prompted the Academy Award or the positive views.  It feels instead like my prejudgment was right in the first place, and this film is garbage.Here are things not to like about this film:1) The trailer.  It gives the impression that the audience it intends (or at least expects) is a bunch of sadistic gossips who want to hear whatever dirty laundry they can about these larger-than-life figures.  It's wrong to prey upon people's most base, perverse desires, even if you're doing so satirically because you have contempt for that attitude in people (Stanley Kubrick did this in ""Eyes Wide Shut"", only with people's desires to see sex).  That's already strike one against it.2) The premise.  It is supposedly a historical film about Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Antonio Salieri.  With few exceptions (and those didn't feel like they were in keeping with the intended tone, even if they were--they felt just the opposite), it gives the impression that this is how it really happened, not like this is an over-the-top performance for purposes of melodrama.  That being the case, it flatters neither Mozart nor Salieri.  Salieri comes across as hellspawn, and aside from Mozart being portrayed irresponsibly (from what I've read, he knew when to keep his love of scatological humor under his hat, not like his caricature here), I even consider it to be unflattering that he supposedly writes music without any corrections.  This gives the implication that Mozart's music is the musical equivalent of ""Scripture"", and that Mozart was simply taking dictation--so that the real author wasn't Mozart at all, but God.  Of course, all inspiration comes from God, and some of what He inspires is inerrant (like actual Scripture), but not only does this threaten to be idolatrous, but it also suggests that Mozart didn't even try--that, for all intents and purposes, he heard someone else's music and copied it down exactly and passed it off as his own.I hate writing disclaimers, especially when I fear that they won't stave off what I write them precisely to stave off (which makes them seem useless), but I'll say this anyway: I know that some creative license needs to be taken for any historical film.  The past is lost to us, and all we have is stories about the past--that's what history is.  But this goes beyond that, tarnishing both Mozart and Salieri--and worse, doing so while both are dead and cannot sue for slander.  How might the real Mozart and Salieri feel about this?  (As a Catholic, I believe both are probably aware of this film in the afterlife.)  Likewise, in spite of my disclaimer, experience has taught me that people will probably say anyway that it was never meant to be historically accurate.  Well, if not, then why does it feel as though it was (with the few exceptions I mentioned)?  More to the point, why not use actual fictitious characters instead of USING real people?  In short, I think that's just making excuses.3) The story itself.  Even if I could get past the previous hurdles, the story itself isn't a good one.  It sets itself up to be a tragedy about hubris and envy, but there is no payoff.  Salieri never learns his lesson at all.  In fact, the only way in which he even changes at the end is that he's found a new outlet for his supreme arrogance--and it's even worse than it already was, because it's hypocritical: calling himself the ""patron saint of mediocrity"" and going around saying ""I absolve you"", as though he had any authority to absolve anyone of anything.  Given this, it's not a tragedy about hubris and envy, it's just a feature film about two men destroying themselves and one of them trying to destroy the other, and sort of succeeding but not in the way he intended.  Who wants or needs to see that?  Unless, again, the target audience expected in the trailer is the correct one?But that effectively seems to me to mean that the ""voice"" of the movie is this evil caricature of Salieri--that the jealousy of the filmmakers (or those whom they are emulating in retelling this version of the story--I make no accusations of any specific people) makes them so unable to stand that imperfect people have such talent that they lack, that they use fiction in order to tear these talents down, not even to making them seem like ordinary people, but to making them seem like awful sorts who didn't deserve the talent or praise or success they got.  But I can't appreciate a movie whose ""voice"" is that of Salieri as depicted here: Salieri is depicted here basically as a Judas figure.  In fact, the one thing I can give credit for here is that, for all that the scene of the crucifix burning made me want to cry (I think the point would have been gotten across fine just by showing him taking the crucifix off the wall--that's all I thought they were going to show--plus I don't know to what degree it's morally acceptable to desecrate something holy even if the intended purpose is to show how evil the character doing it is), at least he's being sincere here.  At least he isn't imagining that he's doing the Lord's work in trying to betray and kill Mozart.  Plus he recognizes (rightly) that his beef ultimately is with God and not with Mozart--nor does he refuse to believe that God exists as a result of this, indicating a very weak faith in the first place.Nevertheless, that's the only depiction of God that we really get in this film, and even if we're not meant to agree with Salieri here about Who God is and what His plan is, we're not given anything to counter this in the film.  Worse, the opportunity was given with the priest to whom Salieri tells his story, but the priest is really useless.  He doesn't even respond to Salieri's story in the end, just sits there with a shocked expression--he might as well not exist, for all the good he does, and Salieri might as well be addressing us, the audience, who cannot interact with him.  In fact, one of the priest's first lines sounds more like it was necessary to tell this particular story than like anyone in real life would ever say it, especially a priest: when Salieri asks the priest ""Do you know who I am?"" the priest says ""Does it matter?"" and claims that we are all equally loved by God.  (The ironic worst part is that this suggests a false notion that this caricature of Salieri rejects--that none of us really matter or stand out at all, which is NOT what the Church teaches, just the opposite.)  The point is, if the ""voice"" of the film is that of the caricature of Salieri here, then this movie is crap and deserves none of the success or praise it's gotten but deserves the same fate as that of Salieri here--to be forgotten, as though it never existed.Worse still, the film feels inconsistent, like it doesn't even know what kind of film it wants to be.  At times, Salieri felt like a secondary character in his own telling of the story--it felt more like it actually was about Mozart's life, even though Salieri is telling it.  I just couldn't think of how to put the puzzle pieces together into a coherent whole.  Is this film about Salieri and his downfall because he couldn't reconcile Mozart's talent with his boorish personality, or is it about Mozart's life and Salieri being the mere instrument of his downfall, with no further significance than that?  Pick one and go with it.Given all this, unless you're the kind of jealous, arrogant gossip this movie seems to be targeting (and I make no accusations against those who like this film--I am sincerely asking why they do), then what is there to LIKE about this movie?  Please comment and tell me because I'm stumped.  The biggest pleasure that I can see getting from this movie--and it's a guilty pleasure--is in criticizing it, is in putting it in its place.  And that is not only a guilty pleasure but a hollow one, because any pleasure I got from that would threaten to make a ""Salieri"" of myself--that this film so offends me that I want to tear it down and consign it to the trash can where I think it belongs.  I don't want to give anyone that satisfaction, of making a ""Salieri"" of me.  (In fact, the only reason I can see for writing any review, even a negative one--other than to counter all the positive ones--is because of my humility and curiosity.  That is, even now I'm willing to consider the possibility that I missed something, and I'm so darned curious as to why anyone likes this.)  But without that, what possible good can come out of watching this film?The only legitimate pleasure I got was learning something in the way of Mozart's life and how it inspired the music that he wrote, but I could have gotten that from a documentary--and the music itself I could have gotten from a CD--I didn't need this particular movie for that.  Other than that, the only good I feel I can credit this film with is making Salieri a more famous name--I have since listened to Salieri's music myself.  While I consider some of it to be very good, sadly what little music of his that I've heard seems to me to be unmemorable (hence, perhaps, why it was forgotten): I couldn't hum any Salieri tune that I've heard if you asked me, like I can with Mozart's music.  And while I can and must credit this film with that, I'd rather that it be a better film that did that--it didn't have to be this particular film that did it.(Okay, there was one other scene from which I derived pleasure, Mozart's improving upon Salieri's welcome tune, but that's only because I interpreted it more charitably than perhaps the filmmakers meant for it to be.  Given the situation, Mozart could have simply been going by ""imitation is the sincerest form of flattery"" and basically saying to Salieri ""You've inspired me--now, if I were writing this tune, here's how I would do it.  What do you, the original composer, think?  Do you like it?""  But it seems as though the filmmakers instead meant for Mozart to be ""showing up"" Salieri and embarrassing him in public by improving upon Salieri's tune--in which case I don't like the scene per se but simply what I would have done with it if I were making the film.  I guess now I'm Mozart to the filmmakers' Salieri?  HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!)I would say, don't waste your money.  If you desire, as I did, not to be prejudiced, check it out at the library--some means of acquiring a copy that doesn't either break the law or require you to spend money--and watch it that way, but don't pay money for this film (and don't break the law).  As far as I can tell, it doesn't deserve it.  The only good that could come from it you can get in other ways--watch a documentary about Mozart's life, listen to Mozart's and Salieri's music, and maybe watch the aforementioned scene on youtube, but don't bother with this film.I invite any fans of this film to tell me why I'm wrong, and what I'm missing, and I hope I'm humble enough to eat my words if I am in fact wrong.  I don't want to feel this way about a film that so many people liked, and that won the Academy Award.  But I'm very tempted to say that if you already own a copy that you bought or that someone gave to you, throw it into the fireplace.  But don't look at it, lest you get a sadistic pleasure out of watching it burn.  And then gratefully forget it ever existed.God bless you all.",1,What is there to LIKE about this?,1404864000,"07 9, 2014",2014,12034,"['honest', 'question', 'so', 'much', 'dislike', 'do', ""n't"",

102739,A1NSUJJCG73IRF,0790734060,"The Tweeder ""tweeder16""","[8, 10]","Director:  Milos FormanCast:  F. Murray Abraham, Tom Hulce, Elizabeth Berridge, Simon Callow, Roy Dotrice, Christine Ebersole, Jeffrey Jones, Charles Kay.Running Time:  160 minutesRated R for some violence, nudity, and language.Based on the life of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, played a terrific and hilarious performance by Tom Hulce. This also has the life of Antonio Salieri, a great and well deserved Oscar winning performance by F. Murray Abraham. Despite the story not being accurate, come on! This is a great movie that was a gigantic Oscar waiting to happen. Congrats to Amadeus for bringing the beauty of classical music into out living rooms.  The story is that we start off with an older and more suicidal Salieri who blames himself for Mozart's death. When a priest comes to ask Salieri to plead forgiveness to the lord and wants to council him, Salieri describes who he was and how music inspired his life, he plays a few notes from his opera's that were masterpieces, the priest just looks at him not knowing the music. Salieri just looks at him with a smile and says ""Ah, how about...?"" he plays Mozart's most famous work and the priest gets excited saying ""Oh, how charming! I'm sorry, I didn't know you wrote that!"" smiling and knowing how it will please Salieri, Salieri just looks at him with an emotionless face ""I didn't. That was Mozart, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart"" and you see the priest's embarrassment. Just great and a perfectly played out performance by Abraham and Frank.Tom Hulce gives Mozart this crazy and annoying yet nevertheless funny laugh that you can't help but laugh at it every time he does it. He brings such life to Mozart and an immaturity that I think some of us can relate too in being spoiled and always knowing you're the best at your talent. He marries Constance played by Elizabeth Berridge and she does it remarkably well. Constance is obviously the more mature one and is the only woman who can try to tame Mozart's crazy ways. When Salieri gets a little jealous that the emperor played by an under rated Jeffrey Jones, since he is the emperor's tutor, then the emperor demands more of Mozart and his music.  Like other landmark movies, ""Citizen Kane,"" ""Psycho,"" ""The Good, The Bad, And The Ugly,"" and ""Jaws,"" ""Amadeus"" hits you a different way each time you see it. It's gripping tragedy, a sad love story, and in parts very funny, sometimes broadly so, like when the midget pantomimes Don Giovanni's entrance in the vaudeville show, or more subtly. Salieri is especially rich in this regard; the way F. Murray Abraham plays him. There's a great scene when he connives to sabotage a Mozart opera, only to have the Emperor arrive and undo his work in such a way to make Mozart think Salieri has in fact done him a great service. Mozart bows meaningfully in Salieri's direction, and Abraham's pained courtliness in his response is a sturdy laugh every time I see it.Abraham won an Oscar for his role, and deserved it, but there's great acting all over the place. Tom Hulce makes Mozart a high-living fellow with a juvenile mind and a poor understanding for the lesser talents of other composers, yet at the same time he makes you care about his many trials. Elizabeth Berridge is believably coquettish and lower-class as Constance, and the Director's Cut really makes you better appreciate what a great actress she was and how unfair it was we never got to see her in another film this good. Jeffrey Jones provides much of the comedy as a Reaganesque Emperor Joseph, good-naturedly opaque, and there's a wonderful bevy of stock characters lurking in the background who all get their turns in the sun, like in a Shakespeare play.  That's a good way to describe ""Amadeus,"" as the kind of film Shakespeare might have made had he plied his trade a few centuries later. The central theme involves one of those classic problems of life, of how one copes with the gift of being able to discern another's greatness without being able to produce the same in return, but there's a wonderful metaphysical mystery underneath, too, the kind W.S. did so well.Director Milos Forman achieves greatness through making a movie about music and opera, and representing his film in just such a way. Even when no performance is being given, the music in the background sets the mood for what we see on screen in an operatic way making it twice as meaningful. It is also beautifully shot, and using all natural light and no artificial lighting, we are treated to an immersing experience that makes one forget it's just a film and these are just actors. Few do this correctly, but when it is, it's truly magnificent and makes the film. The costumes even further add to this atmosphere of realism, as ""Amadeus"" is one of the most beautifully constructed, eloquent films of the last twenty-five years.  Truly exceptional, entertaining, and engrossing even if you aren't a Mozart fan or a devoted fan of music in general.",5,Amadeus  (1984),1137542400,"01 18, 2006",2006,4936,"['Director', 'Milos',

102740,A30OXD42ZFYZLO,0790734060,Thomas Keneally,"[9, 11]","Milos Forman's movie ""Amadeus"" brings to life Peter Schaffer's play. This was a fictionalized version of the life of Mozart and Peter Schaffer, who is one of the foremost authorities on the life of Mozart never claimed it to be real. While the story was fictionalized, the music, costumes and people were not. Right from the time the Russian playright Pushkin wrote the piece ""Mozart and Salieri"", there were dark rumours that Mozart was poisoned. Murray Abraham played the part of jealous Salieri brilliantly. He is the only person who recognizes the talent of Mozart right from the beginning. Right from the beginning of the movie, the screenplay captivates you. The music in the movie was played by Academy of St. Martins in the Fields and conducted by Sr. Neville Marriner. This was put together beautifully with all the right pieces starting from the beginning to the Requiem to the ending of Salieri in the asylum with the piano piece. When this play and movie came out it created a deluge of interest in Mozart and in classical music among different people. The cast starting from Jeffrey Jones to Simon Callow did a very good job with Elizabeth Berridge being the only sore part.While there are deviations from the reality, Mozart was never childish in front of people, the story ignored the impact of Haydn on his music, he was so poor that some people considered his pieces simple as he did not have enough time to compose them compared to more mature composers such as Schubert and Beethoven, he still was one of the most creative composers ever with one of the widest variety in his music. His relationship with his sister is not shown in detail, as his sister was also very creative and talented. Haydn remarked once that Mozart was the greatest composer of his time. At that time Haydn was reknowned and his opinion carried a lot of weight. Also, Salieri is not totally forgotten and I have a CD that ironically has two pieces, one by Mozart and one by Salieri next to each other. So him saying, ""My music, growing fainter, always fainter until no one plays it at all. While his!"" and the background starts one of Mozart's greatest piano concertos, is partly a myth.When the research group went to the Mozarteum in Salzburg to work on the movie, they were rebuffed. The play was considered an anathema. After 10 years, when they went back to work on the collectors edition disc, they were welcomed. The people in Mozarteum considered it a unique cultural contribution which did not diminish Mozart's achievements in any way and enhanced the interest of the world in classical music and in Mozart. So, interest can come through fiction in a way one cannot imagine. This movie was wonderfully put together and people who saw it for the first time developed interest in areas of classical music such as opera. I, for one, consider that itself a success. The emotions of Salieri and his reactions to the music are passionately portrayed. The ending dialog, ""I will speak for you father, I speak for all the mediocrities in the world. I am their champion, I am their patron saint."" will break your heart. The direction by Milos Forman was superb with no dragging on at any time. Some of the operas were filmed in the places where Mozart conducted them first, like the one in Prague. Every award this movie got is well justified. The DVD is also an excellent one and well worth owning for anyone who likes this movie. I for one like both the original and the director's cut. I like the additional pieces with Salieri in them. I would recommend the director's cut as long as people who do not like the nudity to fast forward that part. That was unfortunate, people who feel strongly about it can stick to the original version.",5,Beautiful movie of the creative genius,1123113600,"08 4, 2005",2005,3733,"['Milos', 'Forman', 'movie', 'Amadeus', 'life', 'Peter', 'Schaffer', 'play', 'was', 'fictionalized', 'version', 'life', 'Mozart', 'Peter', 'Schaffer', 'who', 'one', 'foremost', 'authorities', 'life', 'Mozart', 'never', 'claimed', 'be', 'real', 'story', 'was', 'fictionalized', 'music', 'costumes', 'people', 'were', 'not', 'Right', 'time', 'Russian', 'playright', 'Pushkin', 'wrote', 'piece', 'Mozart', 'Salieri', 'were', 'dark', 'rumours', 'Mozart', 'was', 'poisoned', 'Murray', 'Abraham', 'played', 'part', 'jealous', 'Salieri', 'brilliantly', 'only', 'person', 'who', 'talent', 'Mozart', 'right', 'beginning', 'Right', 'beginning', 'movie', 'screenplay', 'music', 'movie', 'was', 'played', 'Academy', 'St.', 'Martins', 'Fields', 'conducted', 'Sr.', 'Neville', 'Marriner', 'was', 'put', 'together', 'beautifully', 'right', 'pieces', 'starting', 'beginning', 'Requiem', 'ending', 'Salieri', 'asylum', 'piano', 'piece', 'When', 'play', 'movie', 'came', 'created', 'deluge', 'interest', 'Mozart', 'classical', 'music', 'different', 'people', 'cast', 'starting', 'Jeffrey', 'Jones', 'Simon', 'Callow', 'did', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'Elizabeth', 'Berridge', 'being', 'only', 'sore', 'are', 'deviations', 'reality', 'Mozart', 'was', 'never', 'childish', 'front', 'people', 'story', 'ignored', 'impact', 'Haydn', 'music', 'was', 'so', 'poor', 'people', 'considered', 'pieces', 'simple', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'enough', 'time', 'compose', 'compared', 'more', 'mature', 'composers', 'such', 'Schubert', 'Beethoven', 'still', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'creative', 'composers', 'ever', 'one', 'widest', 'variety', 'music', 'relationship', 'sister', 'not', 'shown', 'detail', 'sister', 'was', 'also', 'very', 'creative', 'talented', 'Haydn', 'remarked', 'once', 'Mozart', 'was', 'greatest', 'composer', 'time', 'time', 'Haydn', 'was', 'reknowned', 'opinion', 'carried', 'lot', 'weight', 'Also', 'Salieri', 'not', 'totally', 'forgotten', 'have', 'CD', 'ironically', 'two', 'pieces', 'one', 'Mozart', 'one', 'Salieri', 'next', 'other', 'saying', 'music', 'growing', 'fainter', 'always', 'fainter', 'one', 'background', 'one', 'Mozart', 'greatest', 'piano', 'concertos', 'partly', 'myth.When', 'research', 'group', 'went', 'Mozarteum', 'Salzburg', 'work', 'movie', 'were', 'rebuffed', 'play', 'was', 'considered', 'anathema', '10', 'years', 'when', 'went', 'back', 'work', 'collectors', 'edition', 'disc', 'were', 'welcomed', 'people', 'Mozarteum', 'considered', 'unique', 'cultural', 'contribution', 'did', 'not', 'diminish', 'Mozart', 'achievements', 'way', 'enhanced', 'interest', 'world', 'classical', 'music', 'Mozart', 'So', 'interest', 'can', 'come', 'fiction', 'way', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'imagine', 'movie', 'was', 'wonderfully', 'put', 'together', 'people', 'who', 'saw', 'first', 'time', 'developed', 'interest', 'areas', 'classical', 'music', 'such', 'opera', 'one', 'consider', 'success', 'emotions', 'Salieri', 'reactions', 'music', 'are', 'passionately', 'portrayed', 'ending', 'dialog', 'will', 'speak', 'father', 'speak', 'mediocrities', 'world', 'am', 'champion', 'am', 'patron', 'saint', 'will', 'break', 'heart', 'direction', 'Milos', 'Forman', 'was', 'superb', 'dragging', 'time', 'operas', 'were', 'filmed', 'places', 'where', 'Mozart', 'conducted', 'first', 'one', 'Prague', 'award', 'movie', 'got', 'well', 'justified', 'DVD', 'also', 'excellent', 'one', 'well', 'worth', 'owning', 'anyone', 'who', 'movie', 'one', 'original', 'director', 'cut', 'additional', 'pieces', 'Salieri', 'would', 'recommend', 'director', 'cut', 'as', 'long', 'people', 'who', 'do', 'not', 'nudity', 'fast', 'forward', 'part', 'was', 'unfortunate', 'people', 'who', 'feel', 'strongly', 'can', 'stick', 'original', 'version']",N/A

102746,A14VMK6B10ZE4I,0790734060,Val M. Jamora,"[8, 9]","Okay, this is obviously one of the best movies that I have EVER seen.  Many reviewers before me have showered praise, upon which I will decline to add, since the world over knows Mozart's genius.  I would, however, like to offer a few tidbits of information for those of you who have seen the movie, or if you are just a lover of Mozart. 1) The movie is historically inaccurate (although much of the story is based on well known facts).  This is not a big deal, and I fully allow Hollywood the licence for good story telling (and it is GREAT storytelling.)  Kids, don't base your music history papers on it!  No evidence suggests that Salieri killed Mozart, although he did go insane, and tried to confess it.  Salieri did NOT commission the Requiem, although the true patron did commission it in secret and intended to pass it off as his own work. 2)  Some people seem to miss the irony of the ending.  The point of the story is that Salieri did NOT kill Mozart in the end.  He was actually trying to help him finnish the Requiem because Salieri KNEW he was dying, but needed the work completed before he croaked (In real life, the work was finnished by Mozart's student, Sussmeyer)  This is the great tragedy for Salieri because a) he didn't get the Requiem, and b) he himself did not get the pleasure of killing Mozart.  He was, once again, denied by God.  3)  This one is my favorite....  Why is the movie called &quot;Amadeus?&quot;  Because Mozart had a cool sounding middle name?  (Actually, he had a long list of &quot;middle names&quot;)  Mozart himself translated this name from the original &quot;Theophilious&quot; that his father gave him, from Greek into Latin.  The English translation means &quot;Beloved of God.&quot;  Folks, the premise of this movie is a bitter jealousy over who God's &quot;chosen one&quot; appeared to be in the eyes of Salieri.

I was unfamiliar with the urban tale of Antonio SalIeri causing Mozart's death (or at least that's what he thought supposidly) so it was fun and interesting to watch.The movie starts out with Salieri, as an old man, trying to commit suicide.  Having been committed to an insane asylum (very creepy), he confesses to a priest the story of his and Mozart's ugly rivalry.  Later on, I read many historical documents that while there was animosity between the two, supposidly Salieri instructed Mozart's son on several kinds of musical instruments and he accompanied Mozart on a performance of &#34;The Magic Flute&#34;.The acting, costumes, scenery are absolutely magical.  I've never seen anything like it - it was so lavish.  I believe F. Murray Abraham won an Oscar for his performance and Tom Hulce (as Mozart) was nominated as well.  The movie went on to win more Oscars including Best Picture/Best Director (1984).Mozart's glorious music performed by Sir Neville Mariner's St Martin-of-the-Fields symphony is truly inspiring.  Those unfamiliar with his music will be entranced as it is played throughout the entire movie.  The ending scene....I won't give it away but if you don't get choked up, well perhaps you don't have a heart.  One piece (Mozart's Lacrimosa from his Requiem) was a piece I taught my own church choir.  They learned it by watching the movie. Sung in Latin, it won't matter if one understands the text or not, he/she will get the meaning of the piece.As a music teacher, every year I played parts of the movie for my students (it has to be cleaned up some) and the students LOVE it.

102751,A2R1ZCS1UEVJYD,0790734060,Warheart,"[3, 4]","""Amadeus"" is truly one of the greatest films of all time and one of the greatest I've ever seen. I haven't seen the film since I was a child and now it's available on Blu Ray which I had the great pleasure of purchasing for only $15. ""Amadeus"" never looked better and since it's the Director's Cut, the entire movie is gloriously presented in high definition. The 1080p transfer is fantastic and the audio is superb. The nice thing about this package is that it comes in a Blu Ray Book which is what it is, a book. When you open it you see the movie disc on the inside cover followed by pages on photos and commentary on the film. On the inside back cover is a special CD Compilation of Mozart's music. The movie disc also features a one hour ""Making Of"" documentary, which I don't remember being on any other DVD release.The film itself is extraordinary. The story tells of composers Antonio Salieri (played by F. Abraham Murray) and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (played by Tom Hulce). Salieri is a self-proclaimed rival of Mozarts and is deadly envious of Mozart's talent. He absolutely loves Mozart's work but hates that Mozart has the talent and he doesn't. The story chronicles their story as colleagues in Vienna and Mozart becomes a star as Salieri's popularity wanes leading to the end of the film where Mozart dies and Salieri blames himself for it. The film is beautifully shot with gorgeous sets and costumes and the ever so amazing music of Mozart. F. Abraham Murray puts on an amazing performance in which his Oscar was well deserved.Overall, if you haven't seen ""Amadeus"", go out and get it, whether you buy or rent it. You have to see it. For Blu Ray owners, definitely get this one while it's on sale. It's a must have for true lovers of film.",5,"""It is Miraculous""",1235347200,"02 23, 2009",2009,1754,"['Amadeus', 'truly', 'one', 'greatest', 'films', 'time', 'one', 'greatest', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'film', 'was', 'child', 'now', 'available', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'had', 'great', 'pleasure', 'purchasing', 'only', '15', 'Amadeus', 'never', 'looked', 'better', 'Director', 'Cut', 'entire', 'movie', 'gloriously', 'presented', 'high', 'definition', '1080p', 'transfer', 'fantastic', 'audio', 'superb', 'nice', 'thing', 'package', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'Book', 'what', 'book', 'When', 'open', 'see', 'movie', 'disc', 'inside', 'cover', 'followed', 'pages', 'photos', 'commentary', 'film', 'inside', 'back', 'cover', 'special', 'CD', 'Compilation', 'Mozart', 'music', 'movie', 'disc', 'also', 'one', 'hour', 'Making', 'documentary', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'being', 'other', 'DVD', 'release.The', 'film', 'extraordinary', 'story', 'tells', 'composers', 'Antonio', 'Salieri', 'played', 'F.', 'Abraham', 'Murray', 'Wolfgang', 'Amadeus', 'Mozart', 'played', 'Tom', 'Hulce', 'Salieri', 'self-proclaimed', 'rival', 'Mozarts', 'deadly', 'envious', 'Mozart', 'talent', 'absolutely', 'Mozart', 'work', 'Mozart', 'talent', ""n't"", 'story', 'story', 'colleagues', 'Vienna', 'Mozart', 'star', 'Salieri', 'popularity', 'wanes', 'leading', 'end', 'film', 'where', 'Mozart', 'Salieri', 'film', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'gorgeous', 'sets', 'costumes', 'ever', 'so', 'amazing', 'music', 'Mozart', 'F.', 'Abraham', 'Murray', 'amazing', 'performance', 'Oscar', 'was', 'well', 'deserved.Overall', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Amadeus', 'go', 'out', 'get', 'buy', 'rent', 'have', 'see', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'owners', 'definitely', 'get', 'one', 'sale', 'must', 'have', 'true', 'lovers', 'film']",N/A
102752,AQP1VPK16SVWM,0790734060,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[251, 270]","If you're a fan of the original theatrical cut of ""Amadeus"" you'll have mixed feelings about the ""Director's Cut"". While I perfer the latter for a number of reasons, the feeling and flow of the original theatrical version differs somewhat from the ""Director's Cut"".  The most important part are extended scenes that include Salieri agreeing to help Constanze if she has an affair with him. He ends up rejecting her when she shows that she so loves her husband that she would be willing to do so. A number of the opera scenes are extended as well with more business after the show between Mozart and his leading lady. There's also a longer sequence involving Salieri's visit to Mozart comissioning the ""Requiem"". Most of the material adds to the power of the film while a few sequences just give additional back story on various characters. The original theatrical version which won an 8 Oscars runs about 25 minutes shorter than the 3 hour ""Director's Cut"". Forman also provide a fascinating commentary track for the film along with writer Peter Shaffer (""Equus"").The image quality for the ""Director's Cut"" is superior to the original theatrical version. The film was restored to its original luster for re-release resulting in much more natural flesh tones and a sharper visual image as well. The colors which play in important part in conveying the themes of each sequence are more robust and vivid. The theatrical version looks quite good although it was first issued on DVD as a ""flipper"" (meaning you had to flip it over) DVD after roughly two hours to watch the last third of the movie. The big advantage for the theatrical version is Neville Mariner's score on an isolated track.The second disc of the ""Director's Cut"" has one terrific extra, a brief talent list and the original theatrical trailer. The marvelous behind-the-scenes documentary covers the highlights and difficulties that Forman faced in translating Shaffer's stage play to the screen. At nearly 40 minutes it could have provided more background including outtakes, rehearsals and auditions but it's quite a few documentary as it is. There was plenty of room on the second disc to include Mariner's isolated score but the documentary is really all we get.As to which is better--it's a toss up. Both versions of the film work extremely well although I prefer the ""Director's Cut"" for the added footage, the sharper more robust image quality and the higher definintion anamorphic transfer. I do miss the isolated Marriner score of Mozart's music that appeared on the original disc in 5.1. Given the capacity of the second disc, it could easily have been transferred and would have added value to this special edition.A story of envy, lust and anger ""Amadeus"" focuses on the brief life of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. Mozart (Oscar nominee Tom Hulce giving a terrific performance) was a child prodigy who composed his first piece at the age of 4 and produced a remarkably large body of work for such a brief life. His nemesis is court composer Antonio Salieri (Oscar winner F. Murray Abraham in a remarkable performance). This is really Salieri's story as his jealousy drives him to destroy Mozart. Salieri is so consumed with his jealousy, that while recognizing the beauty and originality of Mozart's music, he can't help but want to destroy its creator. Salieri's quaint compositions can't hold a candle to Mozart's complex, original and brilliant pieces.Featuring inspired supporting performances by Christine Ebersole, Jeffrey Jones, Simon Callow (""Three Weddings and a Funeral""), the only performer that doesn't do anything for me is Elizabeth Berridge as Constanze. She replaced Meg Tilly just prior to shooting. The stunning production design, cinematography and sharp direction make ""Amadeus: The Director's Cut"" an experience worth savoring. This deluxe edition features a running commentary by director Milos Forman, writer Peter Shaffer (""Equus""), a great 30 minute documentary on the making of the movie and a terrific 5.1 Dolby Digital remastered soundtrack. Restored from the original film elements, the film hasn't looked this robust and colorful in quite some time. The digital anamorphic transfer looks marvelous and almost rich enough to eat. This version doesn't replace the original theatrical version but is more of an enhanced experience for those who loved the first film. Since this version runs roughly three hours, be prepared for a long evening.Highly recommended, this examination of the destructive power of jealousy still resonates with power, passion and wonderful music. If you're not an opera buff, I'd suggest skipping this for, while the film is powerful, part of the power comes from appreciating the music that Mozart wrote. We see a lot of excerpts from a variety of Mozart's operas throughout the movie. Whichever version of the movie you choose, you'll sure to be delighted. I'd give the ""Director's Cut"" a slight edge for better picture.",5,"Theatrical version vs. ""Director's Cut""",1112745600,"04 6, 2005",2005,4945,"[""'re"", 'fan', 'original', 'theatrical', 'cut',

It's both wildly entertaining and abstractly ""perfect"" in a way that transcends verbal description. (The magnificent performances of Mozart's music by Sir Neville and The Academy don't hurt, either.) Is it any surprise that Pauline Kael -- the Antonio Salieri of film critics -- didn't like it?Even snot-nosed young-uns who couldn't be less interested in classical music have told me they were mesmerized by ""Amadeus."" (And it wasn't the fart scenes that caught them.) Why ""Amadeus"" wasn't one of the ""100 Greatest Films"" selected by People magazine is beyond my comprehension. I therefore need to warn viewers that this version IS NOT the director's cut -- the original theatrical version is!The supplemental material for the deluxe laserdisk included most of the scenes that were ""restored"" to this edition, with the director and producer explaining WHY they were REMOVED!!! The most significant is Salieri's forced seduction of Constanza, which changes the PG rating to an R, and both vulgarizes and makes hash of the story.We are supposed to feel _some_ sympathy for Salieri, a musical hack standing in awe of an infinitely more-talented human being who appears to be the recipient of a very selective divine dispensation -- most of us have experienced that feeling. His promise of help for Mozart in exchange for sex from Constanza destroys whatever sympathy we might have. And it directly contradicts his offer to God to remain chaste in exchange for musical ability.Still a terrific film, but down a (big) notch from five stars.

102755,A1COQ2DOO1O9HD,0790734060,Wing J. Flanagan,"[7, 9]","I had the great pleasure of seeing Amadeus in its opening week in a 70mm print with six tracks of surround-sound.  The clarity and scope of Miroslav Ondricek's cinematography was breathtaking - but then, so was everything else about this film.  I would go on to see it four more times in theaters (in 70mm and 35mm prints of varying quality), and countless times on video tape, laserdisc, and now DVD.Amadeus is a &quot;fantasia&quot; on the life of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (Tom Hulce) that centers on the age-old rumor that he was murdered by a jealous rival, composer Antonio Salieri (F. Murray Abraham).  Don't let its subject matter fool you - Amadeus is thoroughly contemporary filmmaking at its best.  And the DVD, despite the many complaints, serves it well.  Yes, it is a &quot;flipper&quot; (somewhat annoying), and yes, it lacks commentary tracks, deleted material, or a &quot;behind-the-scenes&quot; documentary.  But what more can be added to the staggering accomplishment of the film itself?Much can be said about the performances, the writing, the music, Dick Smith's extraordinary old-age make-up, Milos Forman's direction, the costumes, etc.  In fact, Amadeus is a virtual catalog of &quot;best practices&quot; in each category. But to put the brilliance of Amadeus into words is to diminish it; like trying to convey the qualities of a Mozart opera by talking endlessly about the melodies, harmonies, and libretto.  To put it simply, no amount of description can do justice to the total effect.  I have seen Amadeus literally more times than I can recall.  It is to me like a favorite song or poem; I never tire of it.Consider how this film towers over its own makers: aside from Amadeus, what else can you remember about the careers of F. Murray Abraham, Tom Hulce, Elizabeth Berridge, Simon Callow, or Christine Ebersole?  Or any of the other artists, in front of or behind the camera, who helped to put it on screen? As gifted as they are, no other project has fit them so perfectly.  Amadeus took on a life of its own, symbiotically fed off their unique talents and, in return, gave them each their most perfect expression.  It is as though each artist was born specifically to contribute his or her unique vision to this film.If there is one thing that is consistently under-appreciated about Amadeus, though, it is its editing.  While it does not break new ground, or even draw attention its own technique (like Eisentsein's Battleship Potempkin, for example), Amadeus nonetheless demonstrates that there is no more powerful a cinematic device than a perfectly executed cut from one shot to another.",5,Great film - one to watch again and again,999302400,"09 1, 2001",2001,2622,"['had', 'great', 'pleasure', 'seeing', 'Amadeus', 'opening', 'week', '70mm', 'print', 'six', 'tracks', 'surround-sound', 'clarity', 'scope', 'Miroslav', 'Ondricek', 'cinematography', 'was', 'breathtaking', 'then', 'so', 'was', 'everything', 'else', 'film', 'would', 'go', 'see', 'four', 'more', 'times', 'theaters', '70mm', '35mm', 'prints', 'varying', 'quality', 'countless', 'times', 'video', 'tape', 'laserdisc', 'now', 'DVD.Amadeus', 'quot', 'quot', 'life', 'Wolfgang', 'Amadeus', 'Mozart', 'Tom', 'Hulce', 'age-old', 'rumor', 'was', 'murdered', 'jealous', 'rival', 'composer', 'Antonio', 'Salieri', 'F.', 'Murray', 'Abraham', 'Do', ""n't"", 'let', 'subject', 'matter', 'fool', 'Amadeus', 'thoroughly', 'contemporary', 'filmmaking', 'best', 'DVD', 'many', 'complaints', 'well', 'Yes', 'quot', 'quot', 'annoying', 'yes', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'deleted', 'material', 'quot', 'behind-the-scenes', 'quot', 'documentary', 'what', 'more', 'can', 'be', 'added', 'staggering', 'accomplishment', 'film', 'Much', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'performances', 'writing', 'music', 'Dick', 'Smith', 'extraordinary', 'old-age', 'make-up', 'Milos', 'Forman', 'direction', 'costumes', 'etc', 'fact', 'Amadeus', 'virtual', 'catalog', 'quot', 'best', 'practices', 'quot', 'category', 'put', 'brilliance', 'Amadeus', 'words', 'diminish', 'trying', 'convey', 'qualities', 'Mozart', 'opera', 'talking', 'endlessly', 'melodies', 'harmonies', 'libretto', 'put', 'simply', 'amount', 'description', 'can', 'do', 'justice', 'total', 'effect', 'have', 'seen', 'Amadeus', 'literally', 'more', 'times', 'can', 'recall', 'favorite', 'song', 'poem', 'never', 'tire', 'it.Consider', 'how', 'film', 'towers', 'own', 'makers', 'aside', 'Amadeus', 'what', 'else', 'can', 'remember', 'careers', 'F.', 'Murray', 'Abraham', 'Tom', 'Hulce', 'Elizabeth', 'Berridge', 'Simon', 'Callow', 'Christine', 'Ebersole', 'other', 'artists', 'front', 'camera', 'who', 'helped', 'put', 'screen', 'As', 'gifted', 'are', 'other', 'project', 'fit', 'so', 'perfectly', 'Amadeus', 'took', 'life', 'own', 'symbiotically', 'fed', 'off', 'unique', 'talents', 'return', 'gave', 'most', 'perfect', 'expression', 'artist', 'was', 'born', 'specifically', 'contribute', 'unique', 'vision', 'film.If', 'one', 'thing', 'consistently', 'under-appreciated', 'Amadeus', 'though', 'editing', 'not', 'break', 'new', 'ground', 'even', 'draw', 'attention', 'own', 'technique', 'Eisentsein', 'Battleship', 'Potempkin', 'example', 'Amadeus', 'nonetheless', 'more', 'powerful', 'cinematic', 'device', 'perfectly', 'executed', 'cut', 'one', 'shot']",N/A

Unfortunately, this is a director's cut...and ONLY a director's cut and it expands the movie in a way that doesn't serve the film.  I think my father watched it once and will likely not watch it again.  I wish they had seen fit to include the theatrical version as well to give viewers the option which version to watch.

This is a great movie, and one of my favorite movies of all time.Let's start with the extras.  There was a ""making-of"" documentary that is interesting, and not a whole lot else really.  Pretty standard Director's Cut stuff - not bad, but could have really been souped up even more than this.  The packaging is okay, but again, nothing fantastic.  Just the usual slim case with 2 discs inside with the easily-damaged thin cardboard slip sleeve for the dvd case.But the worst part was, when I watched this edition with the extra scenes back in the movie, I quickly realized why they were cut in the first place.  The extra scenes are not that great, and they make certain parts of the movie much less effective and less dramatic.  The extra scene with Salieri and Constanze Mozart with regards to ""the price"" was okay, but honestly this scene did not change the relationship between the two characters, and really didn't do anything besides add run time to the movie and increase the rating to 'R'.  The deleted scenes in movies are removed for a reason, usually to make the movie flow better, and the Amadeus Director's Cut is no exception to that rule.  Trust me my friends, stick with the plain Jane theatrical version of Amadeus - the version of the movie that won all of the awards.  Although there are barely any extras, and you have to flip the disc mid-way through the movie, this version of the movie is far superior.After watching the Director's Cut, I promptly sold it on ebay and hung on to my bare bones version of Amadeus.  To quote the emperor: ""There are simply too many notes.  Just cut a few, and it will be perfect.""  Apply this to the extra scenes in the Director's Cut - cut a few, and it will be perfect.  Extra scenes or no, still a great movie, but the theatrical version is definitely superior.What we really need is a definitive version of Amadeus in a collector's tin, with documentaries, trailers, booklets, etc. etc. etc., with the extra scenes available if you want to watch them, but SEPARATE from the movie.",3,Too Many Notes.....,1132617600,"11 22, 2005",2005,2185,"['When', 'heard', 'Amadeus', 'Director', 'Cut', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'reinserted', 'back', 'movie', 'was', 'coming', 'out', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'more', 'excited', 'great', 'movie', 'one', 'favorite', 'movies', 'time.Let', 'start', 'extras', 'was', 'making-of', 'documentary', 'interesting', 'not', 'whole', 'lot', 'else', 'really', 'Pretty', 'standard', 'Director', 'Cut', 'stuff', 'not', 'bad', 'could', 'have', 'really', 'been', 'souped', 'up', 'even', 'more', 'packaging', 'okay', 'again', 'nothing', 'fantastic', 'Just', 'usual', 'slim', 'case', '2', 'discs', 'easily-damaged', 'thin', 'cardboard', 'slip', 'sleeve', 'dvd', 'worst', 'part', 'was', 'when', 'watched', 'edition', 'extra', 'scenes', 'back', 'movie', 'quickly', 'realized', 'why', 'were', 'cut', 'first', 'place', 'extra', 'scenes', 'are', 'not', 'great', 'make', 'certain', 'parts', 'movie', 'much', 'less', 'effective', 'less', 'dramatic', 'extra', 'scene', 'Salieri', 'Constanze', 'Mozart', 'regards', 'price', 'was', 'okay', 'honestly', 'scene', 'did', 'not', 'change', 'relationship', 'two', 'characters', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'anything', 'add', 'run', 'time', 'movie', 'increase', 'rating', 'R', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'movies', 'are', 'removed', 'reason', 'usually', 'make', 'movie', 'flow', 'better', 'Amadeus', 'Director', 'Cut', 'exception', 'rule', 'Trust', 'friends', 'stick', 'plain', 'Jane', 'theatrical', 'version', 'Amadeus', 'version', 'movie', 'won', 'awards', 'are', 'barely', 'extras', 'have', 'flip', 'disc', 'mid-way', 'movie', 'version', 'movie', 'far', 'superior.After', 'watching', 'Director', 'Cut', 'promptly', 'sold', 'ebay', 'hung', 'bare', 'bones', 'version', 'Amadeus', 'quote', 'emperor', 'are', 'simply', 'too', 'many', 'notes', 'Just', 'cut', 'few', 'will', 'be', 'perfect', 'Apply', 'extra', 'scenes', 'Director', 'Cut', 'cut', 'few', 'will', 'be', 'perfect', 'Extra', 'scenes', 'still', 'great', 'movie', 'theatrical', 'version', 'definitely', 'really', 'need', 'definitive', 'version', 'Amadeus', 'collector', 'tin', 'documentaries', 'trailers', 'booklets', 'etc', 'etc', 'etc.', 'extra', 'scenes', 'available', 'want', 'watch', 'SEPARATE', 'movie']",N/A
