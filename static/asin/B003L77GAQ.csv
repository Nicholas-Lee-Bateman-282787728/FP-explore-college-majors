1351506,A2C7IWSEHEVXUY,B003L77GAQ,adancer,"[4, 7]","I don't understand the reasoning behind making a religious episode of Glee.  For a show with such a large following made up of different types of people, why would they want to bring in religion and alienate people?  I love Glee.  I have been a fan since they first aired the pilot, but I was so disgusted by the message of this episode that I nearly turned it off.  For once I agreed with Sue Sylvester.  I don't want to say that religion has no place in public schools because religion is part of our society, and part of the people who make up the public schools, however when people begin forcing their viewpoints on others, that is a problem.  It is great to have religious clubs that kids can choose to join where they have the ability to share their common beliefs with others, but in an established club consisting of people of different belief systems, you can't just introduce religion and say conform or else.  They tried to pass it off as spirituality, but the minute you start assigning names such as Jesus or God (with the big G), or other beliefs specific to one religious group, it ceases being spirituality and becomes religion.  I'm honestly surprised that with such emphasis placed on the Jewish students in the past that they didn't speak up more.  What really bothered me was when Kurt was having a rough time dealing with his dad, and the rest of the club was trying to force prayer and religion on him.  He said that he wasn't a Christian because Christianity had persecuted him for being who he was.  That was a reasonable response, and they behaved as though there were something wrong with him.  He didn't say that they were wrong, or that he didn't believe in anything, he just didn't want to be a part of a group that was going to make him feel bad for being honest about who he was.  They spend the rest of the episode forcing their religion on him.  Showing up at his dad's hospital room was inappropriate.  If they really wanted to have a prayer circle, they could have done so in the privacy of one of their own homes, where they weren't going against his wishes and wouldn't upset him when he was already so torn up.  The reason that I gave this two stars is because of the development of the the relationship between Kurt and his dad.  That part of the story line was well done.  Also, the one song that I will download from this episode... Chris Colfer singing ""I Wanna Hold Your Hand"".  It is a beautiful rendition, and he performed it with so much emotion.",2,Why?,1289001600,"11 6, 2010",2010,2493,"['do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'reasoning', 'making', 'religious', 'episode', 'Glee', 'show', 'large', 'following', 'made', 'up', 'different', 'types', 'people', 'why', 'would', 'want', 'bring', 'religion', 'alienate', 'people', 'love', 'Glee', 'have', 'been', 'fan', 'first', 'aired', 'pilot', 'was', 'so', 'disgusted', 'message', 'episode', 'nearly', 'turned', 'off', 'once', 'agreed', 'Sue', 'Sylvester', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'say', 'religion', 'place', 'public', 'schools', 'religion', 'part', 'society', 'part', 'people', 'who', 'make', 'up', 'public', 'schools', 'however', 'when', 'people', 'begin', 'forcing', 'viewpoints', 'others', 'problem', 'great', 'have', 'religious', 'clubs', 'kids', 'can', 'choose', 'join', 'where', 'have', 'ability', 'share', 'common', 'beliefs', 'others', 'established', 'club', 'consisting', 'people', 'different', 'belief', 'systems', 'ca', ""n't"", 'just', 'introduce', 'religion', 'say', 'conform', 'else', 'tried', 'pass', 'off', 'spirituality', 'minute', 'start', 'assigning', 'names', 'such', 'Jesus', 'God', 'big', 'G', 'other', 'beliefs', 'specific', 'one', 'religious', 'group', 'being', 'spirituality', 'religion', ""'m"", 'honestly', 'surprised', 'such', 'emphasis', 'placed', 'Jewish', 'students', 'past', 'did', ""n't"", 'speak', 'up', 'more', 'What', 'really', 'bothered', 'was', 'when', 'Kurt', 'was', 'having', 'rough', 'time', 'dealing', 'dad', 'rest', 'club', 'was', 'trying', 'force', 'prayer', 'religion', 'said', 'was', ""n't"", 'Christian', 'Christianity', 'had', 'persecuted', 'being', 'who', 'was', 'was', 'reasonable', 'response', 'behaved', 'were', 'something', 'wrong', 'did', ""n't"", 'say', 'were', 'wrong', 'did', ""n't"", 'believe', 'anything', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'part', 'group', 'was', 'going', 'make', 'feel', 'bad', 'being', 'honest', 'who', 'was', 'spend', 'rest', 'episode', 'forcing', 'religion', 'Showing', 'up', 'dad', 'hospital', 'room', 'was', 'inappropriate', 'really', 'wanted', 'have', 'prayer', 'circle', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'so', 'privacy', 'one', 'own', 'homes', 'where', 'were', ""n't"", 'going', 'wishes', 'would', ""n't"", 'upset', 'when', 'was', 'already', 'so', 'torn', 'up', 'reason', 'gave', 'two', 'stars', 'development', 'relationship', 'Kurt', 'dad', 'part', 'story', 'line', 'was', 'well', 'done', 'Also', 'one', 'song', 'will', 'download', 'episode', 'Chris', 'Colfer', 'singing', 'Wan', 'na', 'Hold', 'Hand', 'beautiful', 'rendition', 'performed', 'so', 'much', 'emotion']",N/A

Honestly, sometimes I watch Glee for the actual show and characters and other times, I just need a pick-me-up with its beyond fun super karaoke. I have fast-forwarded through many shows just to watch and sing and dance along (great exercise) to my favorite numbers again and again. I highly recommend it. Episodes like Britney/Brittany and every single one featuring the Warblers make up for the flaws of this young series.Why blu-ray?

1351519,AI46E73DWKD2B,B003L77GAQ,BackToGood,"[13, 20]","So what happened to GLEE?! In its freshman season, it was such an original and involving show with well-chosen classic songs interspersed into confident storytelling and performed by a diverse group of young talent. Now, in the second season, it devolved into poor stories and generic plots with way too many ""modern"" songs than don't even sound good when sung by the original artists! The creator, Ryan Whatshisname, really started smelling his own water!So, where to start with the weak Season 2?! First, the show destroyed the great relationship of Rachel and Finn, the centerpiece couple of the show in Season 1, turning Rachel from the ambitious, go-getting diva in Season 1 into a clinging, needy fangirl in Season 2. And Finn from the sweet, funny, gentle giant in Season 1 into a rather hypocritical oaf in Season 2! Actually, I don't blame actor Cory Monteith (who should have been nominated for an Emmy in Season 1!) for this. He was just acting the plot of the bigheaded creater Ryan Whatshisname!In addition to messing up Finchel, I literally disliked EVERY single pairing the show tried in Season 2! Quinn-Sam was boring. Tina-Mike was nondescript. Artie-Brittany and Puck-Lauren were contrived. Kurt-Blaine was phony. And Quinn-Finn was baloney! None of the relationships had any solid foundation or advanced the show in any way, shape or form. Characters were literally just thrown together. Why? Who knows?As for the subplots, Santana's sudden love for Brittany and the Brittany-Artie-Santana triangle was supposed to pass for character growth and development, but I drew NOTHING from it at all; the acting was decent by Heather Morris, Kevin McHale, and Naya Rivera, but nothing special; Rivera fans have been screaming for an Emmy nod, but frankly, it felt very gimmicky to force me to empathize with rather unlikable character.Again, Finchel was broken up mid-season just for the heck of it with that stunt Rachel pulled with Puck just to manipulate fans and to add to Finchel's ""star-crossed"" lover status. The ONLY subplot that was any good was the bullying storyline of Kurt (again Emmy nominated Chris Colfer) by Dave Karofsky (Max Adler, who SHOULD have been nominated!). There was a major development during that storyline that I wonder if they are going to continue into Season 3, ignore altogether, or play off as irrelevant. Who knows with this show now?!And what happened to Shue and Sue? Will Schuester was made into an irrelevant non-factor in Season 2 and for all intents and purposes, he's the star of the show! Mr. Shue's sole role in Season 2 was to pine for the annoying Emma and shout ""guys"" every other line! And Sue Sylvester has become a total caricature of her brilliant Season 1 persona, whose sole role in Season 2 has become to throw cheap insults at Will and fire Cheerios every other ep for the hell of it! Matthew Morrison and Jane Lynch (again Emmy-nominated just because she won last year!) ought to gang-tackle Ryan Whathisname for the trashing of their characters!Finally, the music! Ugh. Most of the songs are from the 2000s, the current worst decade of music in the history of music! The world just heard this crap yesterday! Who wants to hear it again? Season 2 has way too much of the soulless, generic noise that has overrun the music world in the 21st century! And I despised the Warblers in all their faux-singing/dancing glory! In Season 1, the music was excellently fused into the storylines and helped move the plot along, while in Season 2, the music was there just for total grandeur and showmanship. Ep 19-Rumours (best ep of season by default) was the only one devoted to classic songs by the great band Fleetwood Mac and interspersed well into the storyline. Also Ep 21-Funeral was a very emotionally involving and satisfying one, mainly thanks to the reliable Lynch's convincing performance in the wake of a tragedy, even if it was the only ep where Sue's character was done justice.The minor positives of Season 2 are the wonderful cast addition Shannon Jones as the no-nonsense, but likable Coach Beiste and also the cameo characters played by celebrities Gwyneth Paltrow, John Stamos, Kristin Chenoweth, and the great Carol Burnett. Just like in Season 1, the show got the cameos right in Season 2.

The characters actually begin acting a little more childish in this season, a lot more like high school students and adolescents in general, which is nice for the flow.  But often their interactions get a little clich&eacute;d and tiresome.  But that is not enough to dock this season a star.  There are other dramatic moments that are pretty amazing.  Kurt's story gets a lot more interesting for one.The main reason this season is amazing is the variety and quality of the songs performed.  I enjoyed those few episodes in season one where the songs seemed to transform into 'videos'.  That is, not singing in the choir room, but actually having a song start in the room, then all of the sudden they're out in the hall and it's a huge choreographed affair.  The writers did what we wanted and added more dancing and more of the 'music video' element.  Which works with the studio recorded and digitally mastered songs that are performed (no live recorded performances here - at least not when they break into a full song).Of special note, and quite a treat, are the themed episodes.  Yes, you get Rocky Horror Picture Show.  Yes.  And Britney Spears.  Yes.  And they include a good number of Broadway tunes as well, though not quite up to the level and frequency from season one.  And Gwyneth Paltrow makes a guest appearance that is memorable and won her an Emmy.This show is not for everyone.  If you enjoy a broad range of musical styles, and have an open mind (one of the main characters is openly gay, though if you enjoy Broadway musicals you can't really have a problem with openly gay men) then this is a show worth getting into.",5,Much more fun and better tunes than season one ~,1319068800,"10 20, 2011",2011,1763,"['are', 'high', 'low', 'moments', 'drama', 'surrounding', 'characters', 'generally', 'amazing', 'season', 'characters', 'actually', 'begin', 'acting', 'little', 'more', 'childish', 'season', 'lot', 'more', 'like', 'high', 'school', 'students', 'adolescents', 'general', 'nice', 'flow', 'often', 'interactions', 'get', 'little', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'tiresome', 'not', 'enough', 'dock', 'season', 'star', 'are', 'other', 'dramatic', 'moments', 'are', 'pretty', 'amazing', 'Kurt', 'story', 'lot', 'more', 'interesting', 'one.The', 'main', 'reason', 'season', 'amazing', 'variety', 'quality', 'songs', 'performed', 'enjoyed', 'few', 'episodes', 'season', 'one', 'where', 'songs', 'seemed', 'transform', ""'videos"", 'not', 'singing', 'choir', 'room', 'actually', 'having', 'song', 'start', 'room', 'then', 'sudden', ""'re"", 'out', 'hall', 'huge', 'choreographed', 'affair', 'writers', 'did', 'what', 'wanted', 'added', 'more', 'dancing', 'more', ""'music"", 'video', 'element', 'Which', 'studio', 'recorded', 'digitally', 'mastered', 'songs', 'are', 'performed', 'live', 'recorded', 'performances', 'here', 'least', 'not', 'when', 'break', 'full', 'song', 'special', 'note', 'quite', 'treat', 'are', 'themed', 'episodes', 'Yes', 'get', 'Rocky', 'Horror', 'Picture', 'Show', 'Yes', 'Britney', 'Spears', 'Yes', 'include', 'good', 'number', 'Broadway', 'tunes', 'as', 'well', 'not', 'quite', 'level', 'frequency', 'season', 'one', 'Gwyneth', 'Paltrow', 'guest', 'appearance', 'memorable', 'won', 'Emmy.This', 'show', 'not', 'everyone', 'enjoy', 'broad', 'range', 'musical', 'styles', 'have', 'open', 'mind', 'one', 'main', 'characters', 'openly', 'gay', 'enjoy', 'Broadway', 'musicals', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'have', 'problem', 'openly', 'gay', 'men', 'then', 'show', 'getting']",N/A

Amith (kndy),"[1, 1]","Exciting, fun and a definite step-up from the first season, ""glee"" is a fantastic series, breaking boundaries and trying to accomplish something new with each episode!Last season, there was a lot of hype behind the teen musical/comedy/drama series ""Glee"" and for some series, season two can either substantiate a series popularity or prove it was just a fluke.  Fortunately for ""glee"", not only did the series prove that it is one of the best series on television, we also got to see producers and creators of the series experiment with different themes, more music and most of all, giving the characters much more to work with and to let them showcase their talent.The series is created by Ryan Murphy (writer for ""Nip/Tuck"", ""Popular""), Brad Falchuk (producer for ""Nip/Tuck"") and Ian Brennan would gain attention because of its music but for the most part, it would prove to become successful with its catchy music (with actual talent that can sing), a witty storyline and its well-cast characters.The series proved to become so popular worldwide that several soundtracks have been released and have been hits on various worldwide album charts and in 2011, winner of multiple awards and even earned 12 Emmy Award nominations, as well as earning a Golden Globe Award for Chris Colfer (Best Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role in a Series, Mini-Series or Motion Picture Made for Television) and Jane Lynch (Best Performance by an Actress in a Supporting Role in a Series, Mini-Series or Motion Picture Made for Television) as well as earning an award for ""Best Television Series - Musical or Comedy"".""Glee: The Complete Second Season"" features 22 episodes on four Blu-ray discs.

The New Directions perform in New York City for the National Show Choir Championship.VIDEO:""glee - The Complete Second Season"" is presented in 1080p High Definition.  First, the good.  The good is that compared to watching it on HD via satellite, the picture quality is much clearer as details can be seen.  Especially in close-ups of the characters.  Colors are much more vibrant and for the most part, picture quality is very good.  The bad news is that you will see compression artifacts show up during episodes with a lot of red or a lot of blue lighting.Fortunately, this is only done only a few times throughout the second season, most notably when the group performs ""Blame it on the Alcohol?"", that is where you see it the most.  So, I wish that they fit four episodes per Blu-ray disc as opposed to five or six episodes on four Blu-ray discs in order to maximize the video for the entire Blu-ray disc on five Blu-ray discs.But still, compared to having watched in on HD television, the Blu-ray picture quality is very good and fans of the series who want to experience the show in the best quality as possible, will definitely want to watch ""glee"" on Blu-ray!AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""glee: The Complete Second Season"" is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio.  And for me, the biggest difference compared to watching it on television is hearing how the music is utilized via lossless audio through the surround channels.  Dialogue and music is clear coming from the center and front channels but through the surround channels, you can hear how certain instruments and vocals are utilized and definitely makes the music sound really awesome.  So, for example, a song such as ""Singing in the Rain/My Umbrella"", the surround channels are also utilized for the bass drum.  So, the music really makes for an immersive soundtrack and definitely makes the special feature ""Glee Music Jukebox"" worth using and making the music worth listening to over and over via lossless!Subtitles are in English SDH and Spanish.SPECIAL FEATURES:""glee: The Complete Second Season"" comes with the following special features:DISC 1:Glee Music Jukebox - The isolated music portions of each episode.

I definitely want more Brittany and Santana!!! Both Heather Morris and Naya Rivera did a fantastic job on the choreography especially for ""Me Against the Music"". Morris tore it up on ""I'm a Slave 4 U"".I'm sure Morris was being modest when she told New York Magazine, ""We saw it on Friday, with the whole cast and crew saying they liked the Madonna episode better than Britney. But to me they're so different. My character's quirky, so the episode has more comedic stuff; it's more of a funny episode. I thought it was hysterical. ""This episode was waaaaay better than the Madonna episode.My feeling at the time was that the writers were smart in bringing in new characters such as Sam, establishing the Sam and Quinn storyline, the Coach Beiste storyline was emotional but also seeing how the Kurt/Blaine storyline would resonate strongly among viewers.  There were so many things that the writers were doing right for the first half of the series and then the series continued with awesome episodes as we had the emotional ""Grilled Cheesus"" episode with Kurt's father suffering a heart attack, the awesome ""Rocky Horror Glee Show"", the episodes featuring Gwyneth Paltrow and then the fantastic Glee Christmas episode ""A Very Glee Christmas"".And if there was a major improvement, it was the amount of music that was featured in season two and also to see original music being featured as well.  In fact, what really hooked me to the series, especially season two was the music.  Personally, I'm not a fan of covers but the fact that the people on the show can sing and for the most part, how the songs are incorporate to the storyline has definitely made me a weekly viewer of the series.  Also, to find out that ""glee"" now holds the record for 113 single entries on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.  For a TV series to have that much impact, that is quite phenomenal.Also, ""glee"" is not a series about a group of perfect teenagers. Each of these characters have their faults but these characters are well fleshed out in the series that you actually care about these characters and each play their part in each episode.  Will, a teacher and the director of the Glee Club deals losing a person he may have loved but has went to another man.  And the honest feelings that people have in high school and the usual drama enhanced several times to make things seem so much worse than it is.  It's high school life well-covered.So, far I found the music to really be pretty fun and enjoyable.  The series has strong talents especially with the voices of Leah Michele and Amber Riley and Glee cast jams are pretty fun to listen to as well.  But I have to admit that with season two, the two that captured my attention were Heather Morris (Brittany) and Naya Rivera (Santana).  I loved how the writers started to use these two much more and when Naya Rivera and Amber Riley are paired up together, wow... what a wonderful musical pair!But while I loved the majority of the episodes of ""Glee"", I started to realize that the writers were drawing a blank with some of their newer characters.  Sam who started out strong, became a character that started to fade obscurity and that is sad because he could sing (even sadder is that he is not a returning character for season three). But when he was paired with Quinn, they were able to utilize both he and also Dianna Agron much more to their own storyline but break them up and writers tried to pair Sam with other members and it didn't work at all.Then you have Mark Salling who plays the character of ""Puck"".  He was rarely used and when he was, it was for him trying to go after Lauren Zizes, and while it is an interesting concept to try something different with relationships, this is one couple that I can not picture in my mind, chemistry-wise.  If anything, instead of using Lauren's character more towards the budding relationship storyline, there was so much more she could have been used for and she also seems to have lost her regular character status for season three.A major plus was the casting of  Darren Criss (Blaine Anderson) for ""glee"".  I was shocked like everyone when his Warbler rendition of Katy Perry's ""Teenage Dream"" became a big hit on iTunes, doing better than any of the other songs by any ""glee"" cast member and no doubt that the Kurt/Blaine storyline has become very popular this past season.Fortunately, I did like how writers did manage to work things out with Finn and Rachel but the off-and-on status of their relationship can easily grow old.  While I did like the Tina and Mike couple flourishing, I'm still undecided with Artie and Brittany but I did like how the writers worked the Santana/Brittany storyline mid-season and towards the end.So, while I enjoyed season two a lot, I felt there was some stumbling as the season neared the end.  Mainly character utilization but everything else seemed to work out great.  Gwyneth Paltrow and John Stamos were wonderful additions to this latest season and it would be great to see Neil Patrick Harris make a return.And with season three coming soon, suffice to say, some fans were shocked with the announcement that characters such as Rachel, Finn and Kurt will be graduating but I do understand Ryan Murphy's decision as he wants to capture the realistic high school life and the last thing anyone wants to see is a character staying in high school for too long.  You're going to have to say goodbye to characters and say hello to new characters, so it will be interesting to see what Murphy has planned for the 2011-2012 season.  But it appears that the ""Graduation"" may or may not happen. I guess we'll have to wait and see.""glee"" season two had everything that one would instantly fall in love or become hooked on the series.  Featuring fun, emotional and heartbreaking storylines but also seeing the writers do something different and meaningful on television and continuing the trend of featuring awesome music  (makes you wonder how much is spent per episode for licensing the music).As for the Blu-ray release, ""glee: The Complete Second Season"" is definitely an improvement over its HD broadcast but I wish that the episodes were broken down to four per disc to allow for better video for those of us who are picky about picture quality on Blu-ray but still, the picture quality is very good and the lossless audio is fantastic!  Also, I enjoyed the number of special features included but it would be great to have audio commentary for the next Blu-ray release.""glee: The Complete Second Season"" is highly recommended!",5,"glee"" season two had everything that one would instantly fall in love or become hooked on the series.",1323993600,"12 16, 2011",2011,16541,"['Exciting', 'fun', 'definite', 'step-up',

1351565,A1DT955GCOQ8C0,B003L77GAQ,Label,"[104, 153]","Glee Season 2 started off with a great self-effacing recap that I thought bode very well for the season. The writers had clearly listened to some of the feedback on the web and from critics and anytime you become self-aware about your work, it stands to reason it will get better. This has turned out to be somewhat true for Glee in it's sophomore season but there are definitely a few problems that have developed that have given me a reason for concern. However, first the good:The Positive:+ Coach Beiste is a welcome addition and is a better fit than Tanaka. More opportunities there.+ Chord Overstreet as Sam is also a nice addition and replaces Matt in the group.+ Naya and Heather being promoted was a good call. Both bring some great things to the table and add to the diversity in the group. In the same light, Harry Shum also getting promoted was a good call.+ The Rocky Horror tribute was well handled+ John Stamos fit in with the cast and this show like a glove.+ Gwyneth did an pretty nice job as well.+ Nice balance of music/story/comedy in most episodes.+ Also loved Charice's guest spot. Very talented and fit nicely with the cast.+ Darrin Criss is awesome and a very likable character. Also love the warblers. Not a Katy Perry fan but I did like their version of Teenage Dream a lot.+ Corey sounds alot better this year so far.The Negatives:+ The Britney episode was very clumsy. It was a fine idea and I don't have a problem recognizing her impact on music, but the way it was executed just seemed forced.+ Parts of the the Wedding episode were also very clumsy. Sue marrying herself didn't work. It was absurd and should have stayed in the writers head. Waste of a perfectly good Carol Burnett guest star. (I did enjoy their duet together)+ Way too much focus on Kurt to the exclusion of other characters. I do like some of what they've done with his character this year. I always thought it was unfair that Finn took all the blame for the situation down in Kurt's basement when Kurt was equally to blame and to the writers credit, they covered that. I also liked the ""picked on"" angle where Kirk is getting singled out by an in-the-closet guy even if the ""tough guy turns out to be gay"" was not much of a surprise. Obviously kids get picked on for many reasons at school and how painful that is makes for great TV. (Though I wish they'd make the point that more than just gay kids get picked on.) However, there is so much focus on Kurt - and sometimes inappropriately so like the over the top wedding episode - that the other characters suffer because of it. Clearly, Chris is a very talented actor and singer. I enjoy his presence on the show and think it works great. However, I wish it didn't have to be at the cost of all the other characters because right now I'd love to see some Puck, Quinn, Sam, Rachel, Will/Emma or even some Santana or Mercedes story lines.+ Not nearly enough Will and Emma (especially the Emma part)+ Lea's character isn't getting a whole lot of opportunity to sing much this year which is a shame given how talented she is. Yes, I know she got lots of chances in Season 1, but we've almost swung too far the other way this season.Perhaps things will balance out over the remainder of the season and the characters that are being left in the background will get their chance for a storyline as well, but right now it feels like far too much focus in being placed on a select few and some of what made the show so strong in Season 1 is being overlooked as the show tries to tweak it's formula.Overall I still really enjoy the show and will continue to watch and hopefully as Season 2 unfolds a better balance will be struck and we'll get back to the show we all loved in Season 1.",4,Not quite on par with Season 1 yet,1291248000,"12 2, 2010",2010,3728,"['Glee', 'Season', '2', 'started', 'off', 'great', 'self-effacing', 'recap', 'thought', 'bode', 'very', 'well', 'season', 'writers', 'had', 'clearly', 'listened', 'feedback', 'web', 'critics', 'anytime', 'become', 'self-aware', 'work', 'reason', 'will', 'get', 'better', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'somewhat', 'true', 'Glee', 'sophomore', 'season', 'are', 'definitely', 'few', 'problems', 'have', 'developed', 'have', 'given', 'reason', 'concern', 'However', 'first', 'good', 'Positive', '+', 'Coach', 'Beiste', 'welcome', 'addition', 'better', 'fit', 'Tanaka', 'More', 'opportunities', 'there.+', 'Chord', 'Overstreet', 'Sam', 'also', 'nice', 'addition', 'replaces', 'Matt', 'group.+', 'Naya', 'Heather', 'being', 'promoted', 'was', 'good', 'call', 'bring', 'great', 'things', 'table', 'add', 'diversity', 'group', 'same', 'light', 'Harry', 'Shum', 'also', 'getting', 'promoted', 'was', 'good', 'call.+', 'Rocky', 'Horror', 'tribute', 'was', 'well', 'handled+', 'John', 'Stamos', 'fit', 'cast', 'show', 'glove.+', 'Gwyneth', 'did', 'pretty', 'nice', 'job', 'well.+', 'Nice', 'balance', 'music/story/comedy', 'most', 'episodes.+', 'Also', 'loved', 'Charice', 'guest', 'spot', 'Very', 'talented', 'fit', 'nicely', 'cast.+', 'Darrin', 'Criss', 'awesome', 'very', 'likable', 'character', 'Also', 'love', 'warblers', 'Not', 'Katy', 'Perry', 'fan', 'did', 'like', 'version', 'Teenage', 'Dream', 'lot.+', 'Corey', 'alot', 'better', 'year', 'so', 'far.The', 'Negatives', '+', 'Britney', 'episode', 'was', 'very', 'clumsy', 'was', 'fine', 'idea', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'problem', 'recognizing', 'impact', 'music', 'way', 'was', 'executed', 'just', 'seemed', 'forced.+', 'Parts', 'Wedding', 'episode', 'were', 'also', 'very', 'clumsy', 'Sue', 'marrying', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'was', 'absurd', 'should', 'have', 'stayed', 'writers', 'head', 'Waste', 'perfectly', 'good', 'Carol', 'Burnett', 'guest', 'star', 'did', 'enjoy', 'duet', 'together', '+', 'Way', 'too', 'much', 'focus', 'Kurt', 'exclusion', 'other', 'characters', 'do', 'what', ""'ve"", 'done', 'character', 'year', 'always', 'thought', 'was', 'unfair', 'Finn', 'took', 'blame', 'situation', 'down', 'Kurt', 'basement', 'when', 'Kurt', 'was', 'equally', 'blame', 'writers', 'credit', 'covered', 'also', 'liked', 'picked', 'angle', 'where', 'Kirk', 'getting', 'singled', 'out', 'in-the-closet', 'guy', 'even', 'tough', 'guy', 'out', 'be', 'gay', 'was', 'not', 'much', 'surprise', 'Obviously', 'kids', 'get', 'picked', 'many', 'reasons', 'school', 'how', 'painful', 'great', 'TV', 'wish', ""'d"", 'make', 'point', 'more', 'just', 'gay', 'kids', 'get', 'picked', 'However', 'so', 'much', 'focus', 'Kurt', 'sometimes', 'inappropriately', 'top', 'wedding', 'episode', 'other', 'characters', 'suffer', 'Clearly', 'Chris', 'very', 'talented', 'actor', 'singer', 'enjoy', 'presence', 'show', 'think', 'great', 'However', 'wish', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'cost', 'other', 'characters', 'right', 'now', ""'d"", 'love', 'see', 'Puck', 'Quinn', 'Sam', 'Rachel', 'Will/Emma', 'even', 'Santana', 'Mercedes', 'story', 'lines.+', 'Not', 'nearly', 'enough', 'Will', 'Emma', 'especially', 'Emma', 'part', 'Lea', 'character', ""n't"", 'getting', 'whole', 'lot', 'opportunity', 'sing', 'much', 'year', 'shame', 'given', 'how', 'talented', 'Yes', 'know', 'got', 'lots', 'chances', 'Season', '1', ""'ve"", 'almost', 'swung', 'too', 'far', 'other', 'way', 'season.Perhaps', 'things', 'will', 'balance', 'out', 'remainder', 'season', 'characters', 'are', 'being', 'left', 'background', 'will', 'get', 'chance', 'storyline', 'as', 'well', 'right', 'now', 'far', 'too', 'much', 'focus', 'being', 'placed', 'select', 'few', 'what', 'made', 'show', 'so', 'strong', 'Season', '1', 'being', 'overlooked', 'show', 'tweak', 'formula.Overall', 'still', 'really', 'enjoy', 'show', 'will', 'continue', 'watch', 'hopefully', 'Season', '2', 'better', 'balance', 'will', 'be', 'struck', ""'ll"", 'get', 'back', 'show', 'loved', 'Season', '1']",N/A

And that earns the episode a few stars.However, the majority of the plot is absolutely ridiculous.(There are spoilers throughout the following. I tried to keep most things vague, but some details are below that probably shouldn't be read if you haven't seen the episode yourself.)The party was amusing. It's the best scene. It's so ridiculously over the top that it's hard not to laugh at at least part of it. And it leads to some fun dialogue and a bizarrely great performance between two of the people you always wanted to hear duet, and never thought you would.Glee's view of alcohol is incredibly dumb though. The moral seems to be that responsible drinking is the way to go, for adults or teenagers. But while this completely practical message is being preached, the show seems to be showing that anytime anyone drinks, they can't stop ever until it makes them sick. They rant about ""responsible drinking"" while demonstrating exactly how NOT to drink responsibly.In this universe though, the only way to drink EVER is to binge drink. Drinking of any kind, ever, even if you're an adult who has a beer at home every once in a while, is terrible and will ruin your life. The whole drinking plot is further proof that the writers have never spoken to actual teenagers or drank in their lives. Either that, or they're just dumb.The saving grace is Will's practical solution to the drinking.Secondly, for a show that claims to be ""progressive,"" the view of bisexuality is ignorant at best. Apparently the creators want you to be exactly who you are, as long as who you are isn't confusing or weird to the writers. I mean, bisexuals, right? What's up with them, thinking they can love or be attracted to someone regardless of sex? And even if they don't turn out to be bisexual, teenagers question their sexuality all the time. Why not support them like the show allegedly supports struggling gay teens?Third, Kurt has no reason to accuse his dad of not supporting him. It is not unreasonable for a parent to be uncomfortable having a person their child is interested in spend the night at their house. Burt obviously wouldn't let Finn have a girl over either for the night.This is such a frustrating episode, plot-wise.Sue's speech was cruel, but darkly funny, as was the tragic performance of ""Tik Tok.""

Bearing that in mind, let's take the route of this season's first episode and recap what was the first season of ""Glee"":""Glee"" tells the story of a tiny, bullied glee club (a show choir where the participants sing and dance to either pop or showtunes or both without actually performing a musical) and how both the power of music and a kind mentor who believes in them helps twelve misfits forge a family and strive to share how special they are with the world, no matter how much is stacked against them. Although it sounds like a strangely cheesy premise and an unlikely TV show, ""Glee""'s madcap formula, amazing music performances, terrific acting, intriguing characters, and potently quotable one-line zingers launched it into the stratosphere and it quickly became an international sensation and success. Within these plot lines, ""Glee"" tackled the sensitive issue of teen pregnancy (and how religion can impact that issue) wonderfully, along with showcasing the struggles of teenagers with body issues, the confusing adolescent world of sexuality, popularity, friendship, family, loyalty, bullying and peer pressure. Although there were a few misses in the first season, overall the season itself was one of the brightest and freshest new shows around, and it won several awards for it as well.There's the rub, however: ""Glee"" is handled by three showrunners (Ryan Murphy, Brad Falchuk, and Ian Brennan), all of whom apparently decided that they could do no wrong. They flatly refused to bring in other writers or directors for season two, and since they were still selling massive amounts of music from the show and getting millions of views from their devoted audience of ""gleeks"", every single thing that was wrong about season one got blown out of proportion in season two, while everything that was right fairly faded to the background. The result? Season two of ""Glee"" started off strongly but by the second half meandered into sloppily handled plotlines that were often began and concluded in the space of one episode, characters acting severely out of character just for the sake of an episode's ""theme"", ""theme of the week"" episodes that were no longer touching or interesting but instead cheesy PSA-type episodes, bloated importance of guest stars, and a season finale that failed in every way that season one's finale succeeded.Where on earth did ""Glee"" go so wrong? Season two's worst mistake was the characters acting out of character as ""Glee"" committed the worst mistake that any sophomore effort of a creative work, be it a film, television show or novel, can make: it completely erased any and all character development from the first season and started the characters off fresh. Rachel Berry, the club's star, who learnt the mistakes of her selfishness and made friends and learned how to lead a team in season one? Back to being a self-centered and often downright mean diva who stepped on each of her teammates to get what she wanted. Finn Hudson, the loveable popular dummy with a heart of gold who learned how to be a star and effectively lead the glee club and also learned that popularity was meaningless because he liked the glee club losers better than the popular football jerks? Right back to being a selfish, obsessed-with-being popular jerk to all of his friends.However, the two characters this affected the worst? Firstly, Mr. Schuester. Mr. Schue was once the teacher everyone wished they could have: he put his students above everything, he pushed them, he motivated them, he guided them to being the best that they could be. Season two saw our once-beloved Schue essentially hitting a midlife crisis, using his glee club as an excuse to try to get closer to his now-unavailable crush Emma Pillsbury the guidance counselor, acting like a spoiled brat, and continually believing himself better than what he was. The second character was, of course, Quinn Fabray. Quinn began as the pretty and mean popular girl who became pregnant and became part of the heart of season one as she made true friends amongst the glee club, learned the value of family, and overcame her own meanness when the club rallied around her during the pregnancy issue. Season two saw absolutely no mention of her being pregnant anywhere ever. She inexplicably broke up with Puck (no explanation was ever given) and rejoined the Cheerios because she suddenly (like Finn) needed to be popular again. Although some of this damage was repaired by her new boyfriend Sam (newcomer Chord Overstreet), that repair was itself destroyed even worse later on. I won't even mention the destruction of Sue Sylvester, who transformed into a meaningless, cartoonish villain who was rarely even funny by the end and required a brutal character death just to reign her back in.Despite all of this, however, season two began on a strong note (with the exception of the hot mess that was the ""Britney/Brittany"" Britney Spears tribute episode; despite some truly hilarious one-liners courtesy of Brittany (Heather Morris), this was likely one of the worst episodes of ""Glee"" to ever air) as it took a central theme: bullying and its impacts. Openly gay Kurt (masterfully played by Chris Colfer) took center stage as the school's relentlessly homophobic popular crowd was highlighted, leading to the explosive ""Never Been Kissed"" episode. Rachel's newfound (or oldfound, as the case may be) selfishness led to other glee club members to fight for their chance to shine and wounded the glee club badly when her bullying led to new student Sunshine Corozon (a criminally underused Charice) defecting to New Directions' mortal enemies Vocal Adrenaline, and Schuester's selfish and out of character behavior led to his kids whole-heartedly choosing hilarious new substitute Holly Holiday (wonderfully played by Gwenyth Paltrow) over him, and Santana's mean insistence on hiding from her feelings by attacking other people blew up spectacularly in her face.In fact, despite two truly terrible episodes (""Britney/Brittany"" and the wretchedly badly done ""Rocky Horror Glee Show""), season two was off to a wonderful note, until the hiatus. When ""Glee"" returned after its touching Christmas episode, however, to the spectacularly overwrought Superbowl episode, things began going downhill fast, and they stayed that way for the rest of the season with a few notable exceptions. The biggest mistakes?1) Rachel and Finn's Story: While I myself am not a ""Finnchel"" shipper (in ""Glee"", the portmanteaus of the couples are so important an episode was named after one), what was done to their relationship was criminally bad writing. Rachel wanted revenge on Finn for something he had done and so kissed his friend Puck. Finn broke up with Rachel and refused to forgive her for cheating on him...while he convinced Quinn to cheat on her boyfriend with him. Finn then went on to string both Rachel and Quinn along by emotionally cheating on Quinn with Rachel, then dumping Quinn out of the blue to return to Rachel. None of it made sense.2) Quinn's further character murder. See above.3) Kurt's storyline. What began as a heartwrenching display of how bullying gone too far can have devastating consequences quickly turned mind-numbing. While not to give away too many spoilers, Kurt was physically, emotionally, and verbally abused, which escalated into something like sexual assault and physical intimidation, before his life was threatened, causing him to leave the school for a different school with a no-bullying policy. Despite the wonderful plotline of Blaine Anderson (newcomer Darren Criss), Kurt rapidly reverts back to his selfish season one ""bitch"" persona from the first few episodes, then under one flimsy excuse switches right back to McKinley and goes back to being bullied, essentially rendering his entire plotline meaningless, and then goes on to remark ""It's been a good year for Kurt Hummel"" at the end of the season. Did I mention his father randomly had a heart attack and almost died in one of the season's better episodes? Really, writers?4) The finale. The finale (it bears repeating). As I've said, season one's finale was wonderful. Season two's finale was essentially one giant episode centered around Finn and Rachel -- which in itself wouldn't have been so bad, except for it was wrapped up very badly -- while giving us some bad music, a wasted appearance by Jonathan Groff as Jesse St. James, and absolutely no resolution for any of the characters, particularly Kurt or his chief tormentor Karofsky. The ending was predictable and somewhat dim, and was generally an uneven end to an uneven season.5) The self-contained episodes: NO MORE PSA episodes, please. Deal with an issue for teenagers over a two-episode arc where the lesson is meaningful, like season one did. Also, the plotlines such as Blaine's sort-of-maybe bisexuality that were introduced in one episode and wrapped up a half an hour later were just sloppy and useless.But what did season two do right?1) When it was handled well, season two's episodes were wonderful. From the good parts of Kurt's storyline to the heartwrenching religion episode centered around Burt Hummel's heart attack, to a surprisingly impactful episode centered around sexuality, season two's good moments shone like diamonds.2) New characters. The initial cast of ""Glee"" will graduate by the end of next season (or some of them at least). Rather than do something terrible like getting rid of all the old cast members and introducing new ones in one fell swoop, the integration of Sam and Lauren into the existing was well done. The introduction of Kurt's new boyfriend(!) Blaine was wonderfully well-handled and the a capella Warbler's group was a fresh voice to the music; in fact, Kurt and Blaine's relationship was the only one really handled well this season.3) Original songs! ""Glee"" took a chance and came up with original songs, ranging from the silly (""Trouty Mouth"", ""My Cup"") to the downright good and fun (""Hell to the No"", ""Loser Like Me"", and the epic ""Light Up the World""), to the emotional power ballads (""Get It Right""), to the very bad attempts at emotional power ballads (""Pretending"").4) Character journeys. While I have been disgruntled at some character developments, Santana and Brittany were heartbreaking to watch; when left alone from Finn Rachel became a truly sympathetic character; Sam and Blaine and Lauren were all wonderfully well-done; and despite its flaws the episode ""Born This Way"" dealt masterfully with the characters confronting their flaws and fears.In the end, what can be said of season two? It failed to live up to season one, that much is obvious. But the writers are actually hiring a new team of staff writers, so clearly they are learning something. Ultimately, it was still an enjoyable season despite its flaws. If anything, season two was a lesson in itself -- no one and nothing is perfect. ""Glee"" has succeeded despite this to show that in its imperfections some of the characters became even more interesting. What's in store for season three? None of us are demanding a perfect show. But if some of the problems of this season can be learned from and the first season can be used as an example, we might get something truly remarkable.One thing is certain: ""Glee"" certainly isn't going anywhere anytime soon, and despite all of its flaws we just can't stop believin'.",4,"Like ""A Midsummer Night's Dream""...For Better or Worse.",1306800000,"05 31, 2011",2011,11609,"['been',

Every week, we get the equivalent of a broadway show in our homes and the entire DVD set will provide many, many hours of quality entertainment. Although I haven't yet seen the second season since I don't have live television here in the woods of Appalachia, my husband and I have really enjoyed the first season. While many people comment about the half-season releases and cost (and leave not-so-positive remarks), I am sure that it costs quite a bit of money to bring this show to us (several million dollars for some episodes, I have read).With actors, writers, sets, costumes, locations, live musicians, etc., this show is very expensive to create, I am sure. And people are complaining about paying $30-40 to see a full season of such quality entertainment? I don't understand that. That is less than the price of one ticket to a show and we get a full season of comedy, drama, amazing musical numbers, and ground-breaking opportunities for people to view and understand characters that represent many diverse groups and individuals in our culture. That kind of a quality production doesn't come cheap and we are so fortunate to have the opportunity to experience this at such a reasonable price.I would encourage people to purchase this set and pay retail in order to support such quality television and the people who bring it to us. If we don't honor those who give us something worthwhile, shows like this won't long exist in the production world of cut budgets, cheap sitcoms, and inane reality shows. Our support will ensure that quality programming will continue to happen.

1351599,A73QPH7NGI0DJ,B003L77GAQ,Sean Curley,"[16, 22]","""Glee"" had a phenomenally successful debut year, taking a high risk concept and turning it into a ratings smash hit and a major cultural event that straddled both the television and music industries.  The twenty-two episodes of the show's second season is overall a mixed bag, with many of the show's strenghts continuing to be in evidence, and many of the show's weaknesses still present.  There has been a tendency among some fans of the show to overly idealize the first season, in particular the first thirteen episodes, a tendency I would overall reject.  I don't think overall that the second season represents a notable drop in quality from the first.  However, the show's shakier aspects (particularly in terms of narrative and character continuity) have continued to be evident, and I think fans are increasingly demanding that the show improve in those respects.  Some spoilers follow.Whereas the first season was split into two halves that saw New Directions go to its Sectional and Regional competitions (which made the outcome of the latter contest rather obvious from a structural standpoint), this season has a three-way split:  Sectionals (episode 9), Regionals (episode 16), and Nationals (episode 22), and announces from the start that the Nationals competition this year will be in New York City.  This predetermines the outcome of the earlier contests, but that likewise wouldn't surprise anyone, given that the club's existence depends on their winning the first two contests anyway.  However, the majority of the season is given over to two focuses:  couples drama, and gay-related Issues plotlines.Concerning the former, some of it is well-done (mostly the gay ones; see below), but in many instances it becomes extremely repetitive and trying on patience.  This is particularly pronounced in the case of the show's supposed central coupling, Rachel (Lea Michele) and Finn (Cory Monteith).  Originally they were supposed to be together all season, but instead they broke up a little less than halfway through and spent the rest of it orbiting each other; the writers dredged up last year's obstacles again (Quinn [Dianna Agron], in an excruciatingly illogical plot, and Jesse [Jonathan Groff]), and their final reconciliation just spotlights how little their stories had advanced in a year.  They more or less redo the first year's finale in the second.  And the back half of the season does neither character any favours:  Finn, who was cheated on by Quinn last year and broke up with Rachel over an incident of cheating, then persuades Quinn to cheat on Sam with him; this gigantic hypocrisy goes unremarked on by all; Rachel, meanwhile, becomes a pathetic hanger-on.  If these characters are going to be together, then let them be together and develop their stories; it is no coincidence that easily the best Finn/Rachel storyline of the season is in ""Duets"", them working together to achieve a common goal.  Various other romantic couplings occur, such as Tina/Mike [Jenna Ushkowitz/Harry Shum, Jr.], which is more or less ignored from the moment it begins; and Puck/Lauren [Mark Salling/Ashley Fink], which is a surprisingly successful comic courtship.Then there are the gay stories.  ""Glee"" attracted some controversy in Year Two from people who thought it was ""too gay"", an idea I categorically reject; given the paucity of gay representation on TV (though that's improving), the idea that one of America's major teen-oriented TV shows would embrace gay issues is laudable in the extreme.  This complaint, I think, is partly a manifestation of a more valid complaint:  that the writers don't give the straight characters the same care and attention that they do to the gay ones.  Particularly with Kurt (Chris Colfer), the only character who is allowed a major season-long storyline and a genuine parental presence (Mike O'Malley as Burt); there's an obvious gulf between the quality of the material here.  Kurt's search for a boyfriend (who arrives in the form of Blaine Anderson, played by Darren Criss) is a reasonably well-done story.  Criss is an energetic addition to the cast.  More problematic is the gay bullying storyline, which greatly confuses the issue by ultimately becoming about redeeming a closeted gay kid who bullies (and who is consequently more or less let off scot-free for his behaviour).  There's also a pronounced double-standard between the now-serious treatment of Kurt's bullying and the farcical depiction of the bullying of everyone else - ammunition for people who think the show is slanted in Kurt's favour.  Also in the gay front, pleasingly, the show finally stops pretending that Santana (Naya Rivera) and Brittany (Heather Morris) are straight, and in the second half of the season they take centre-stage more and more; and this well-executed story carries quite a bit of the latter half of the year, making great use of two of the show's best talents.Acting-wise, this is probably Colfer's season; I wouldn't be at all surprised if he wins the Emmy for his contributions here.  Rivera, as Santana, is close behind; finally given the chance to play Santana as more than just a bitchy mean girl, she is astonishingly poignant.  The ""Landslide"" and locker confession scenes in episode 15 are truly amazing pieces of acting, and, in a just world, would also put Rivera in major awards contention (though she'll likely be blocked by co-star Jane Lynch as the show's nominee in the supporting actress field).  Lynch, meanwhile, suffers greatly in comparison with season one; Sue is increasingly irrelevant to the show, and it's emblematic of this that a number of the season's best episodes (""Duets"", ""Silly Love Songs"", ""Born This Way"") don't include here at all.  Heather Morris, like Rivera, gets an expanded role, and, though she has some shaky bits, eventually proves to be surprisingly credible as a dramatic actress as well as a comedienne.  Lea Michele, Cory Monteith, and Matthew Morrison (Mr. Schuester) continue to do good work, but they're underserved by their material this year.Superb music, vibrant characters, and writing that is capable of being very affecting; at the same time, paired with shaky narratives and sometimes ill-judged stories.  ""Glee"" continues to be a good show that is just shy of being truly great.  With a larger writing staff being hired for next year, one hopes they can improve further, particularly is this is indeed the last time with the original cast.",4,Growing pains in its second

Especially after the creator/writer admitted some of those very mistakes and the precipitous fall in Season 2 ratings. I am cautiously optimistic abot Season 3, however, so perhaps the rabid Gleeks will be able to admit that Season 2 was disappointing and consider dropping their low ratings of the ""helpfulness"" of my review.Updated: 7 March 2012As predicted, Season 2's sales and overall (as in the combined average, especially the downward trend of ratings), not to mention overall reviews, were lower for Season 2. I just wanted to add that I was pleasantly surprised that Season 3 looks much more promising. Just hoping the episode which aired on 21 Feb didn't ""jump the shark"" in its quest to regain ratings. I think people just more or less gave up on it after the end of last season (by the end of Season 2, Glee was getting around 9 million viewers, down from an average high 12 million. Worse than that was that Glee at 9m viewers was eclipsed by NCIS with 18.6m--double the viewers! It was even eclipsed by Dancing with the Stars with 13.8m viewers.My point in this review is that numbers talk, and Glee's numbers for Season 2 just didn't justify the cost (especially of the Blu-ray). Unfortunately, it looks like the ratings just didn't come back, and opposite NCIS--the most popular show on TV right now, it still fell short, with NCIS getting close to 20m viewers compared to just under 7m for Glee. Even a repeat of NCIS yesterday got 14m...Really sad for a show that was such a breath of fresh air and showed such promise. I'll say this, though--Glee always goes on the DVR while I watch NCIS, and is watched shortly thereafter!Because of all the above, I dropped my rating from three to two stars...Finally, I would love to know if those who didn't find my review ""helpful"" really just didn't like the fact that although I like Glee, there's good and bad with everything, and when it's just not that great and is that overpriced, it's bad.

And now to my two cents:COMPLAINTS:First off, I'd like to know why the characters of Glee have been replaced with alien lifeforms?I miss Sue!  The REAL Sue!  The one who is awful all the way until a kid is in legitimate danger or personal pain at which point her heart is revealed to care after all!  The new Sue is horrible... what a waste of the perfect balance of wicked and sweet achieved in season 1.  Now... she's just mean.  Her jokes are still worthy of a laugh, but without the Sweet 'n' Sour thing goin' on... they don't work nearly as well.  There's no more, ""yeah right, we know how awesome you really are y'old bully""... now it's, ""I bet you would.""  Sad sad.Next up... What's with the cheatfest?  Over half the characters on the show cheat now?And what about Kurt?  Um, why has the lovable Kurt gotten so stereotypically prissy?  His character was better in Season 1.Lastly, the music...SERIOUSLY?  Once the Christmas episode was over, the music went down the drain (and it didn't compare to Season 1 to start with!)  What the heck happened?  Showtunes so obsolete (and for good reason) that they're unrecognizable?  And I have to say... I LOVE music.  I love love it, all kinds of it, all genres even, but the music after the Christmas episode was so astoundingly painful to listen to I actually fast forwarded through most of it.  Sad.COMPLIMENTS:Some long overdue attention and focus on Santana!  Yes the girl can SING!  Yes she can DANCE!  Yes she's gorgeous!  Yes she's hilarious!  (My personal favorite character!) Santana?  Just YES!  Can't wait to watch her story unfold further!Got another one (compliment that is)... Coach Beiste!  FANTASTIC new character.  In fact... is that what happened to Sue Sylvester?  Because, it seems like her Season 1 character has been put into the new Season 2 Coach Beiste (again with the pod people thing!)  LOVE her!.. (still lamenting the alien abduction of Sue though.  Sniff.)CONCLUSION:I love Glee and will continue to watch it but I was very unhappy with the character mutilations.  The music, as stated above was horrendous as well.  But... it's Glee and when it's good it's so very very good, it's worth the wait to watch it.
