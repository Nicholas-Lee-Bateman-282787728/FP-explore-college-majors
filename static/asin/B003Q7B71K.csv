1358605,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B003Q7B71K,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[3, 4]","A legacy of heroism winding back five long centuries, born out of piracy and shipwreck and tragedy. The immortal Phantom has been unflagging in his fight against the Singh Brotherhood, an international crime syndicate that has ever sought to spread its corruption. Lee Falk's creation lives again in this Syfy Channel effort. But Lee Falk may be spinning in his grave. Hell, Billy Zane may be spinning in his grave.In his last year at Columbia law, Christopher Moore can occasionally be found on the New York City rooftops, scaling walls, hurdling obstacles, performing back flips, practicing the perilous art of parkour. The law study gets put on hold - the parkour training comes in really handy - when Chris is informed by a mysterious organization that this isn't his real life, that his real name is Kit Walker. That his is the honored bloodline of a legendary globetrotting crime fighter named the Phantom. To preserve the illusion of immortality, the Walker men have always assumed the mantle of the Ghost Who Walks. Chris's father was the 21st in an unbroken line. But is the world ready for the 22nd Phantom? It turns out, no.Maybe if this were a new character rather than a reinvention of an iconic comic strip character... It's pretty hard to do justice to an iconic figure so linked to its pulp era, especially when there's a determined mindset to bring that icon to a modern day setting. What happens then is you flirt with cheesing off audiences that would naturally gravitate toward this show. Sometimes, when you strive for the hip update, the soul of the thing is mislaid. Tape don't lie.Warning bells were ringing like a mother. The wonky starts with the Phantom himself as played by Ryan Carnes. My opinion only, but Kit Walker shouldn't look like Dax Shepherd. And unless the costumed adventurer's secret identity is James Howlett, he should stand taller than a garden gnome. This iteration of the Ghost Who Walks doesn't exude a larger-than-life presence. The Phantom threads are radically altered, and while I'm not at all averse to a costume change or modification, the proviso is that it not look lame or uninspired. This new costume is not only lame and uninspired, it makes him look generic, like a fancified member of the S.W.A.T. team. The purple bits are hard to make out. Also, visors and kevlar vests are for wussies.The movie suffocates under a landslide of poor choices. A horribly banal screenplay. Sluggish pacing. A slow burn parceling of story content. A tendency to drag out scenes. Lackluster action scenes. NOT ENOUGH action scenes. The dreary score. The writers approached this with SMALLVILLE sensibilities, and maybe you can't blame them given the television platform and a modest budget. The internal conflict naturally deals with Chris's acceptance of his destiny. But the external conflict revolves around the very tired plot device of mind control. The Singh Brotherhood has figured out the Phantom's secret and I do like the follow thru thinking the Brotherhood utilizes: cut off the bloodline. However, the fallout is that this motivates Chris to take up the family business.This three-hour-long two-part mini-series was made with an eye towards an ongoing television series. As such, the Phantom's potential supporting cast is introduced and given time on screen. Thing is, there's an erosion of the overarching mythic elements whenever the camera shifts from the Phantom to track the (relatively) mundane lives of an NYPD police detective and his daughter. The most intriguing supporting character is the beautiful Guran (Sandrine Holt), one of the Phantom's advisors. Meanwhile, Jean Marchand is detached and creepy as the Phantom's mentor, Abel Vandermaark, and damn if he's not one of the good guys. The other beautiful girl in this movie is Cameron Goodman, although she gets the less interesting role of the girlfriend. Isabella Rossellini is also here, and so what?Another irritating thing is that the film goes to painstaking lengths to establish Chris Moore as a parkour practitioner. However, other than the chase scene from the French murder twins, we barely see Chris performing parkour.The best scenes concern Chris's time in the jungles of Bengalla as he undergoes training. The rest is boring. The film's parting shot if of the Singh Brotherhood's inner circle chanting their mantra: ""Long live the Singh Brotherhood... and death to the Phantom!"" Judging the arsebottom quality of this mini-series, they may get half their wish. I don't really foresee a television series spinning out of this. Then again, television networks aren't exactly known for their acumen, eh? This incarnation lacks credibility, more the Ghost Who Plods than Walks. I found the Phantom more credible when he was adventuring in the year 2040 or hanging out with Flash Gordon and Mandrake the Magician. In cartoon form.The DVD's bonus stuff includes ""What the hell was that?"" interviews with Diretor Paolo Barzman (00:06:01 minutes) and actor Ryan Carnes (00:11:03 minutes) - did these guys not prepare for these interview questions? There's also THE PHANTOM trailer, which looks shady.",2,"""The Phantom's dealt with bigger things than this with four nuns, and a can of kerosene, and an organ grinder's monkey.""",1284249600,"09 12,

What was problematic to me were: The phantom wore a bullet-proof costume but it did not cover the lower part of his face; why would he walk into a hail of machine gun bullets shot by two men; surely at least one round would have hit him in his exposed face. The villains had a mole in the Phantoms hideout, so they knew his location, yet they were searching for him; couldn't they bomb the hideout; even if he wasn't home, it would have killed his assistants and destroyed his supplies. We are shown that his costume gave him enormous power, much more than people have; yet a couple of times he was almost beaten during hand to hand combat. The film repeats several times that the Phantom does not purposely kill people; yet after wounding two men who tried to machine-gun him, he leaves them in a room and bombs it. If I misunderstood and he had killed them rather than wounding them, this is also a contradiction. As with all films about masked heroes, the hero only covers his eyes but most of his face is visible; how is it possible that his loved one would not recognize him. This problem is especially strong regarding superman where the only difference between superman and Clark Kent is that the former has a curl falling over his forehead and doesn't wear glasses.

While I actually really like the film with Billy Zane (more for its sense of humor than anything else, but does have some really interesting action set pieces), I LOVED this update. The director Paolo Barzman really takes a page from the book of Christopher Nolan in giving a purposeful update to a character that hasn't had the best treatment before by, in essence, rebooting the character of Kit Walker aka The Phantom by giving him a reason to become an avenger of evil, rather than just allowing it to be his destiny rather than his choice. And by giving the miniseries a slow burn, allowing us to understand the beginnings of this incarnation of The Phantom rather than just diving right in and showing us, ""Okay, there's this guy who's The Phantom and he fights piracy and evil wherever he finds it.""I really liked Ryan Carnes also as Chris/Kit. I liked the fact that he already has some training in parkour, but also seems to have certain inherent abilities that are perhaps tied to his specific lineage.The film overall has some nice surprises, and feels, in many ways very much like Nolan's BATMAN BEGINS. And that is not a bad thing. I feel that it's a little whiny to say that ""Oh, well, we actually have to wait until halfway through before we get to see The Phantom!"". That's akin to being disappointed by waiting about 50 minutes into a feature film before we see Bruce Wayne in the Batman outfit or about 40-odd minutes before Clark Kent first saves Lois Lane.The bottom line is this: This was an excellent update and will hopefully become a series, and once that happens, I'm sure that will be pretty excellent too.",5,The Phantom Begins...,1284336000,"09 13, 2010",2010,1777,"['Essentially', 'not', 'huge', 'die-hard', 'fans', 'original', 'Lee', 'Falk', 'Phantom', 'who', 'Ghost', 'Who', 'be', 'more', 'comic', 'strip', 'actually', 'really', 'film', 'Billy', 'Zane', 'more', 'sense', 'humor', 'anything', 'else', 'have', 'really', 'interesting', 'action', 'set', 'pieces', 'LOVED', 'update', 'director', 'Paolo', 'Barzman', 'really', 'page', 'book', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'giving', 'purposeful', 'update', 'character', ""n't"", 'had', 'best', 'treatment', 'essence', 'rebooting', 'character', 'Kit', 'Walker', 'Phantom', 'giving', 'reason', 'become', 'avenger', 'evil', 'rather', 'just', 'allowing', 'be', 'destiny', 'rather', 'choice', 'giving', 'miniseries', 'slow', 'burn', 'allowing', 'understand', 'beginnings', 'incarnation', 'Phantom', 'rather', 'just', 'diving', 'right', 'showing', 'Okay', 'guy', 'who', 'Phantom', 'piracy', 'evil', 'wherever', 'really', 'liked', 'Ryan', 'Carnes', 'also', 'Chris/Kit', 'liked', 'fact', 'already', 'training', 'parkour', 'also', 'have', 'certain', 'inherent', 'abilities', 'are', 'perhaps', 'tied', 'specific', 'lineage.The', 'film', 'overall', 'nice', 'surprises', 'feels', 'many', 'ways', 'very', 'much', 'Nolan', 'BATMAN', 'BEGINS', 'not', 'bad', 'thing', 'feel', 'little', 'whiny', 'say', 'Oh', 'well', 'actually', 'have', 'wait', 'halfway', 'get', 'see', 'Phantom', 'akin', 'being', 'disappointed', 'waiting', '50', 'minutes', 'feature', 'film', 'see', 'Bruce', 'Wayne', 'Batman', 'outfit', '40-odd', 'minutes', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'first', 'saves', 'Lois', 'Lane.The', 'bottom', 'line', 'was', 'excellent', 'update', 'will', 'hopefully', 'become', 'series', 'once', ""'m"", 'sure', 'will', 'be', 'pretty', 'excellent', 'too']",N/A

My exposure to The Phantom is limited to the 1996 Billy Zane movie, which is most memorable to me for the over-the-top performance Treat Williams gave. Similarly, this attempted relaunch also had a comical villain. That aside, there were some interesting elements; namely the characters directly connected to our new hero. I'm unfamiliar with the lead actor's previous work, but he did well here. I could have seen this becoming a Smallville-esque franchise but SyFy tends to be more restrictive on their products. I should note, one of the more intriguing characters/performances came from Sandrine Holt, who shone even more brightly against a few of the more hammy (short-lived) performances.

I thought one of my favorite characters was going to be raped by writers who thought they could make a completely awesome new school movie by ignoring the original groundwork.  As a huge fan of the Phantom (and someone who loved and still loves the Billy Zane movie) I felt I owed it to myself to preorder the DVD and give it a chance.I understand the length of the movie.  The Phantom is an older character and I see why the makers felt the plot needed to be elaborated on for the newer audience.  Great job explaining everything and setting the story.  However, I did not like the futuristic skull cave idea.  The Phantom was a lone ranger with a very few close friends, not with a full military attack center staff.  Also, the suit was a HUGE problem.  The Phantom was meant to be a gun slinger, not a SWAT/James Bond/The Hurt Locker hybrid.  I would have much rather had the original suit.  But  good job explaining the new suit.  ""Your dad didn't like the old suit"", simply enough right?As far as action, there really wasn't any.  Nothing to keep you on the edge of your seat.  I realize this Kit Walker didn't have his entire childhood to train, but Carnes played a very rough screwball of a character that was learning on the job, I felt a little more polish was in order.  No incredible stunts.  Mainly this movie is about explanation.I thought Ryan Carnes being casted was suspect, but he actually put my foot in my mouth.  For the part that was written, Carnes pulled it off well and I wouldn't have a problem with him playing a future Phantom because he really seemed to get into the character.  Good look for the character and completely capable of playing a role such as this.I heard this movie was made to test the ground and see if people would like a Phantom motion picture to be made.  Either a new story or a reboot to the Zane  film.  Personally I think they could have done a better job if that was their aim.  Its kind of like Shyamalan's Unbreakable, it is a good explanation movie but nothing that makes you want to see it really develope.  If it does fine, if it doesn't fine.My suggestion is to pick up the original Zane film and watch it, it is a great movie and what is surprising is how well they pulled it off with a low budget.  There are millions pumped into comic book movies today that can't compare to The Phantom.  If you enjoy the original, pick this up and spend some time watching it.  I would have rated it 4 stars, however I know that this movie strayed far from the original idea of the Phantom.  IMO it was too much new material covered all at once.  While I don't consider it the flop that forums quickly deemed it, I'm not going to say it was a really strong movie.  With the resources that they obviously had, there was no reason this movie couldn't have given the 96 film a run for its money.",3,Actually surprised me,1293926400,"01 2, 2011",2011,2921,"['reading', 'reviews', 'people', 'who', 'watched', 'Syfy', 'was', 'frightened', 'thought', 'one', 'favorite', 'characters', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'raped', 'writers', 'who', 'thought', 'could', 'make', 'completely', 'awesome', 'new', 'school', 'movie', 'ignoring', 'original', 'groundwork', 'huge', 'fan', 'Phantom', 'someone', 'who', 'loved', 'still', 'Billy', 'Zane', 'movie', 'felt', 'owed', 'myself', 'preorder', 'DVD', 'give', 'chance.I', 'length', 'movie', 'Phantom', 'older', 'character', 'see', 'why', 'makers', 'felt', 'plot', 'needed', 'be', 'elaborated', 'newer', 'audience', 'Great', 'job', 'explaining', 'everything', 'setting', 'story', 'However', 'did', 'not', 'futuristic', 'skull', 'cave', 'idea', 'Phantom', 'was', 'lone', 'ranger', 'very', 'few', 'close', 'friends', 'not', 'full', 'military', 'attack', 'center', 'staff', 'Also', 'suit', 'was', 'HUGE', 'problem', 'Phantom', 'was', 'meant', 'be', 'gun', 'slinger', 'not', 'SWAT/James', 'Bond/The', 'Hurt', 'Locker', 'hybrid', 'would', 'have', 'much', 'rather', 'had', 'original', 'suit', 'good', 'job', 'explaining', 'new', 'suit', 'dad', 'did', ""n't"", 'old', 'suit', 'simply', 'enough', 'right', 'As', 'far', 'action', 'really', 'was', ""n't"", 'Nothing', 'keep', 'edge', 'seat', 'realize', 'Kit', 'Walker', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'entire', 'childhood', 'train', 'Carnes', 'played', 'very', 'rough', 'screwball', 'character', 'was', 'learning', 'job', 'felt', 'little', 'more', 'polish', 'was', 'order', 'incredible', 'stunts', 'Mainly', 'movie', 'explanation.I', 'thought', 'Ryan', 'Carnes', 'being', 'casted', 'was', 'suspect', 'actually', 'put', 'foot', 'mouth', 'part', 'was', 'written', 'Carnes', 'pulled', 'off', 'well', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'problem', 'playing', 'future', 'Phantom', 'really', 'seemed', 'get', 'character', 'Good', 'look', 'character', 'completely', 'capable', 'playing', 'role', 'such', 'this.I', 'heard', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'test', 'ground', 'see', 'people', 'would', 'like', 'Phantom', 'motion', 'picture', 'be', 'made', 'new', 'story', 'reboot', 'Zane', 'film', 'Personally', 'think', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'better', 'job', 'was', 'aim', 'kind', 'Shyamalan', 'Unbreakable', 'good', 'explanation', 'movie', 'nothing', 'want', 'see', 'really', 'develope', 'fine', ""n't"", 'fine.My', 'suggestion', 'pick', 'up', 'original', 'Zane', 'film', 'watch', 'great', 'movie', 'what', 'surprising', 'how', 'well', 'pulled', 'off', 'low', 'budget', 'are', 'millions', 'pumped', 'comic', 'book', 'movies', 'today', 'ca', ""n't"", 'compare', 'Phantom', 'enjoy', 'original', 'pick', 'up', 'spend', 'time', 'watching', 'would', 'have', 'rated', '4', 'stars', 'however', 'know', 'movie', 'strayed', 'far', 'original', 'idea', 'Phantom', 'IMO', 'was', 'too', 'much', 'new', 'material', 'covered', 'once', 'do', ""n't"", 'consider', 'flop', 'forums', 'quickly', 'deemed', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'say', 'was', 'really', 'strong', 'movie', 'resources', 'obviously', 'had', 'was', 'reason', 'movie', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'given', '96', 'film', 'run', 'money']",N/A

You can turn on English (only) subtitles and this is the setup option.  After you play part one, it's back to the menu. Then you can manually decide to play part 2.  Special features include interviews with the star and director and we also have a trailer.  No other trailers are present.  The video is pretty good...HD and wide screen.  The sound is good but only stereo.  I think it is recorded with a 5.1, but only once or twice did I notice a sound that may have come from the surrounds.The movie was ok, but I felt a bit overwhelmed by the plot holes. One example: the police let the Phantom go when a shooting victim tells them that the Phantom saved his life.  New York cops won't just let a masked and armed man go without even asking for an ID.  This Phantom's support team got a serious upgrade from the Pygmy People.  The Phantom has a Skull Cave with a good looking antique living quarters lighted with electric lights including a chandlier rather than candles.  He has an endless suite of hospital facilities, science labs, computers, etc on the lower levels.  Also, a gym, shooting range, motor pool, and even a cafeteria (but the Phantom can call room service...I'm not making this up).  This was a bit much to shove into Skull Cave.

1358623,A11CYNCILLSRZ8,B003Q7B71K,Robert L. Anderson,"[0, 0]","I thought this would be series was great fun. Wonderful production values. It was not done cheaply like so many rebots, remakes, etc. etc. etc. At first I could not accept young Ryan Carnes as The Phantom, but when I realized that this was like a sequel and not a remake, I was fine with it. Young Kit (Carnes) was yet another son of the last Phantom. Too bad the last Phantom died because it would have been great to see Billy Zane reprise his role as the Phantom. I am in my 70's and I've been a fan of The Phantom since my Aunt Mary used to read me the comic strip in the Sunday American here in Chicago. So I do know a little of the subject of which I speak. In fact I learned how to read because of my interest in the comics such as Dick Tracy, Smilin' Jack, Invisible Scarlet O'neil, Brenda Starr and Terry & The Pirates.  And before I go on with my review, let me say that, that outfit the the new Phantom had has got to go. It's terrible. Too bulky, terrible headpiece. I don't know what they were thinking with that terrible outfit. And you couldn't even see if it was really purple! What were they thinking-an Iron Man type outfit? They can make fun of the spandex outfit all they want , but that was The Phantom. Billy Zane looked great in that original Phantom suit. And that silly outfit Kit was in was not really The Phantom. Just another Super Hero jumping from roof to roof. And that very complaint of mine may be the reason the two part series was not picked up to go on in a reguler series! No doubt. To bad too because like I stated it was a good story and concept.And one more complaint (sorry about that) if your a fan of Isabella Rossellini and expect to see her a lot of her in this film, forget it. Isabella has a short role in it. All together she may be in the movie 10 or 15 minutes. And she too had an ugly headpiece. A gawky foolish blonde wig and terrible make-up. Why a great actress like Isabella would take such a role I'll never understand. But when she speaks you can close your eyes and hear the voice of her Morher Ingrid Bergaan. Who in my humble opinion was one of the greats in The Glory Days of Hollywood.The colors in this film are gorgious. Sharp & clear. And the acting is some of the best I've seen. And the new young Phantom is a good interesting actor and very youthfully good looking. I sincerly hope Ryan Carnes makes it. He's got the looks and talent. And in the 'Glory Days  he would be a big star. Well the film was made a couple of years aga and I didn't even know it existed until I seen it advertised on Amazon. Well that's my humble review and if anyone would like to drop ma an email, fine.  robert,anderson110@comcast,net",3,"Great Film, But The Outfits Got To Go",1321574400,"11 18, 2011",2011,2679,"['thought', 'would', 'be', 'series', 'was', 'great', 'fun', 'Wonderful', 'production', 'values', 'was', 'not', 'done', 'cheaply', 'so', 'many', 'rebots', 'remakes', 'etc', 'etc', 'etc', 'first', 'could', 'not', 'accept', 'young', 'Ryan', 'Carnes', 'Phantom', 'when', 'realized', 'was', 'sequel', 'not', 'remake', 'was', 'fine', 'Young', 'Kit', 'Carnes', 'was', 'yet', 'son', 'last', 'Phantom', 'Too', 'bad', 'last', 'Phantom', 'died', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'see', 'Billy', 'Zane', 'reprise', 'role', 'Phantom', 'am', '70', ""'ve"", 'been', 'fan', 'Phantom', 'Aunt', 'Mary', 'used', 'read', 'comic', 'strip', 'Sunday', 'American', 'here', 'Chicago', 'So', 'do', 'know', 'little', 'subject', 'speak', 'fact', 'learned', 'how', 'read', 'interest', 'comics', 'such', 'Dick', 'Tracy', 'Smilin', 'Jack', 'Invisible', 'Scarlet', ""O'neil"", 'Brenda', 'Starr', 'Terry', 'Pirates', 'go', 'review', 'let', 'say', 'outfit', 'new', 'Phantom', 'had', 'got', 'go', 'terrible', 'Too', 'bulky', 'terrible', 'headpiece', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'were', 'thinking', 'terrible', 'outfit', 'could', ""n't"", 'even', 'see', 'was', 'really', 'purple', 'What', 'were', 'thinking-an', 'Iron', 'Man', 'type', 'outfit', 'can', 'make', 'fun', 'spandex', 'outfit', 'want', 'was', 'Phantom', 'Billy', 'Zane', 'looked', 'great', 'original', 'Phantom', 'suit', 'silly', 'outfit', 'Kit', 'was', 'was', 'not', 'really', 'Phantom', 'Just', 'Super', 'Hero', 'jumping', 'roof', 'roof', 'very', 'complaint', 'mine', 'may', 'be', 'reason', 'two', 'part', 'series', 'was', 'not', 'picked', 'up', 'go', 'reguler', 'series', 'doubt', 'bad', 'too', 'stated', 'was', 'good', 'story', 'concept.And', 'one', 'more', 'complaint', 'sorry', 'fan', 'Isabella', 'Rossellini', 'expect', 'see', 'lot', 'film', 'forget', 'Isabella', 'short', 'role', 'together', 'may', 'be', 'movie', '10', '15', 'minutes', 'too', 'had', 'ugly', 'headpiece', 'gawky', 'foolish', 'blonde', 'wig', 'terrible', 'make-up', 'Why', 'great', 'actress', 'Isabella', 'would', 'take', 'such', 'role', ""'ll"", 'never', 'understand', 'when', 'can', 'close', 'eyes', 'hear', 'voice', 'Morher', 'Ingrid', 'Bergaan', 'Who', 'humble', 'opinion', 'was', 'one', 'greats', 'Glory', 'Days', 'Hollywood.The', 'colors', 'film', 'are', 'gorgious', 'Sharp', 'clear', 'acting', 'best', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'new', 'young', 'Phantom', 'good', 'interesting', 'actor', 'very', 'youthfully', 'good', 'looking', 'sincerly', 'hope', 'Ryan', 'Carnes', 'got', 'looks', 'talent', ""'Glory"", 'Days', 'would', 'be', 'big', 'star', 'Well', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'couple', 'years', 'aga', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'existed', 'seen', 'advertised', 'Amazon', 'Well', 'humble', 'review', 'anyone', 'would', 'like', 'drop', 'email', 'fine', 'robert', 'anderson110', '@', 'comcast', 'net']",N/A
1358624,AV6QDP8Q0ONK4,B003Q7B71K,"The Movie Guy ""Movies from A to Z""","[2, 2]","This is a long 2 part story. It appears to be made for Canadian TV. No sex, nudity, or bad language. Like American movies, the bad guys are black, except in this one they speak French Canadian. The main bad guys hang out in Switzerland and boast a mish-mash of indistinguishable international accents, including one female (Belladonna Lithia) whose haircut makes me think she was once part of the Swedish Bikini team of the 1980's.Ryan Carnes plays Chris Mooore, who lives with people he thinks are his parents. Like Luke Skywalker his past is kept secret and then one day he comes home, finds his legal guardians killed by the bad guys and vows revenge. Like Spiderman, he also likes the redhead next door. And there is a corporate meeting which reminded me of the one in Kill Bill.Chris Moore has lost his memory and doesn't know he is the Phantom, although he does like to jump around the roofs of buildings. Once he is arrested, his DNA goes out on the Interpol network and he is discovered by the Good Guys and the Bad Guys, the Singh. Eventually Chris assumes the role of the Phantom and uses his new high tech bullet proof suit. It turns out his dad died from cancer (must have been those purple dyed asbestos fibers in the old suit). The bad guys have  a weapon called ""Flicker"" or Flickr for you Yahoos or Flicka for you cowboys. This device uses digital TV to turn people into Manchurian Candidates, who will keep the war machine going and the arms dealers rich.The movie doesn't have long drawn out action scenes. It is long on dialogue and building characters. If this is the first in a series. i.e. an introduction of characters, they did a good job. However, if this is it, you might wait until you have 3 hours to kill on a movie that is more carrot on a stick than action.",4,INTRODUCES CHARACTERS,1286064000,"10 3, 2010",2010,1788,"['long', '2', 'part', 'story', 'be', 'made', 'Canadian', 'TV', 'sex', 'nudity', 'bad', 'language', 'American', 'movies', 'bad', 'guys', 'are', 'black', 'one', 'speak', 'French', 'Canadian', 'main', 'bad', 'guys', 'hang', 'out', 'Switzerland', 'boast', 'mish-mash', 'indistinguishable', 'international', 'accents', 'including', 'one', 'female', 'Belladonna', 'Lithia', 'haircut', 'think', 'was', 'once', 'part', 'Swedish', 'Bikini', 'team', ""1980's.Ryan"", 'Carnes', 'plays', 'Chris', 'Mooore', 'who', 'people', 'are', 'parents', 'Luke', 'Skywalker', 'past', 'kept', 'secret', 'then', 'one', 'day', 'home', 'legal', 'guardians', 'killed', 'bad', 'guys', 'vows', 'revenge', 'Spiderman', 'also', 'redhead', 'next', 'door', 'corporate', 'meeting', 'reminded', 'one', 'Kill', 'Bill.Chris', 'Moore', 'lost', 'memory', ""n't"", 'know', 'Phantom', 'jump', 'roofs', 'buildings', 'Once', 'arrested', 'DNA', 'out', 'Interpol', 'network', 'discovered', 'Good', 'Guys', 'Bad', 'Guys', 'Singh', 'Eventually', 'Chris', 'role', 'Phantom', 'new', 'high', 'tech', 'bullet', 'proof', 'suit', 'out', 'dad', 'died', 'cancer', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'purple', 'dyed', 'asbestos', 'fibers', 'old', 'suit', 'bad', 'guys', 'have', 'weapon', 'called', 'Flicker', 'Flickr', 'Yahoos', 'Flicka', 'cowboys', 'device', 'digital', 'TV', 'turn', 'people', 'Manchurian', 'Candidates', 'who', 'will', 'keep', 'war', 'machine', 'going', 'arms', 'dealers', 'rich.The', 'movie', ""n't"", 'have', 'long', 'drawn', 'out', 'action', 'scenes', 'long', 'dialogue', 'building', 'characters', 'first', 'series', 'i.e', 'introduction', 'characters', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'However', 'might', 'wait', 'have', '3', 'hours', 'kill', 'movie', 'more', 'carrot', 'stick', 'action']",N/A
