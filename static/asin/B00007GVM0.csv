728700,A2GANR9I6XHTU9,B00007GVM0,Amy Lynn,"[1, 2]","After watching this award winning documentary on the amish teens you wont think of them as so much diffrent than yourself or your kids anymore- they are just regular people who have problems just like the rest of us- if not more problems. The documentary revolves around the life of amish teens when they go through the period of Rumspringa , a time in thier life where they must decide whether to leave the amish family and life and live in the ((english)) world or to commit to a lifetime within the amish community. Most after experiencing the outside world come back to stay and have life in amish community but some decide to leave and want to live in outside world- to some being amish just isnt what they want for themselves , they dont picture themselves living that kind of life. Its hard decision for some and it shows the story of a group of amish teens and the experiences they go through during rumspringa, ( some of which might suprise you) it isnt typical of what you think the amish kids would do but they have many experiences then decide whether to leave thier familys and make life for themselves outside the amish religion and family or to remain in the community at the end of this period of finding themselves and experiencing both sides. The amish are very fascinating and im glad they have this documentary to give a bit more insight into the amish life. Highly recomended. 4 stars",4,Interesting Documentary,1078876800,"03 10, 2004",2004,1405,"['watching', 'award', 'winning', 'documentary', 'amish', 'teens', 'wont', 'think', 'so', 'much', 'diffrent', 'kids', 'are', 'just', 'regular', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'problems', 'just', 'rest', 'us-', 'not', 'more', 'problems', 'documentary', 'revolves', 'life', 'amish', 'teens', 'when', 'go', 'period', 'Rumspringa', 'time', 'thier', 'life', 'where', 'must', 'decide', 'leave', 'amish', 'family', 'life', 'live', 'english', 'world', 'commit', 'lifetime', 'amish', 'community', 'Most', 'experiencing', 'outside', 'world', 'come', 'back', 'stay', 'have', 'life', 'amish', 'community', 'decide', 'leave', 'want', 'live', 'outside', 'world-', 'being', 'amish', 'just', 'isnt', 'what', 'want', 'dont', 'picture', 'living', 'kind', 'life', 'hard', 'decision', 'story', 'group', 'amish', 'teens', 'experiences', 'go', 'rumspringa', 'might', 'suprise', 'isnt', 'typical', 'what', 'think', 'amish', 'kids', 'would', 'do', 'have', 'many', 'experiences', 'then', 'decide', 'leave', 'thier', 'familys', 'make', 'life', 'amish', 'religion', 'family', 'remain', 'community', 'end', 'period', 'finding', 'experiencing', 'sides', 'amish', 'are', 'very', 'fascinating', 'im', 'glad', 'have', 'documentary', 'give', 'bit', 'more', 'insight', 'amish', 'life', 'Highly', 'recomended', '4', 'stars']",Devil's Playground

These are not things one would normally associate with the Amish, but there you go, it's time to learn about DEVIL'S PLAYGROUNDMost of us probably view the Amish as isolationists and backward thinkers. They don't use electricity or modern conveniences. They travel by horse and carriage. They dedicate themselves to their church and community for life or are banished if they give up the church and head out into the ""English"" world. This is mostly true, except for one period in an Amish person's life.At age 16, all children of Amish parents are given the option of Rumspringa (Pennsylvania Dutch for ""running around""). Rumspringa can last minutes, hours, days, weeks, or even years, depending on the individual. During this time they are allowed to do whatever they like, which includes drinking, sexual relations, smoking, driving (cars), and doing illicit drugs.One such person is Faron, an 18-year-old son of an Amish minister. He's been out of his parents' house for almost two years and gets involved with crystal meth dealers in order to support his own drug habit. His life spirals out of control, but his parents are helpless to do anything about it because of the Rumspringa tradition. Faron has to choose his own path. But with peer pressures so high, the decision is not an easy one for kids who want to explore a world beyond the Amish communities they grew up in. You can't help but cringe with fear as Faron drops in and out of the drug culture, nearly gets himself killed in a car accident, and eventually finds love and a decent job many miles away from his parents.Other kids have similar issues, but battle more with internal conflicts than external pleasures and material things. One is Velda, a pretty Amish girl who left her community and found depression nesting within her. Trying to discover who she was without the help of her family and her church leads her down some dark paths but she eventually succeeds in life by finding a job and going to college; quite a surprise considering the Amish don't educate their young beyond the 8th grade level.This documentary certainly was an eye-opener. Who would've thought that the Amish deal with similar problems that non-Amish parents are forced to deal with? The information gathered by the film makers is impressive but limited, as the Amish become reclusive once they join the church. But the kids have no such qualms about being filmed since they have yet to take their oath.I am disturbed mostly by the fact that the Amish don't educate their young beyond a certain grade level because they feel it causes too much ""pride"" (one of the seven deadly sins). But this also creates an interesting paradox. If you don't educate your kids, they are destined for menial jobs. The upside (I guess) is that this makes it difficult to support themselves if they decide to try and make a go at living in the outside world. Not surprisingly, the return rate from Rumspringa back to the church is 90 percent.",4,Informative Yet Disturbing,1156032000,"08 20, 2006",2006,3016,"['Sex', 'drugs', 'heavy', 'metal/rap', 'music', 'Nintendo', 'are', 'not', 'things', 'one', 'would', 'normally', 'associate', 'Amish', 'there', 'go', 'time', 'learn', 'DEVIL', 'PLAYGROUNDMost', 'probably', 'view', 'Amish', 'isolationists', 'backward', 'thinkers', 'do', ""n't"", 'use', 'electricity', 'modern', 'conveniences', 'travel', 'horse', 'carriage', 'dedicate', 'church', 'community', 'life', 'are', 'banished', 'give', 'up', 'church', 'head', 'out', 'English', 'world', 'mostly', 'true', 'one', 'period', 'Amish', 'person', 'life.At', 'age', '16', 'children', 'Amish', 'parents', 'are', 'given', 'option', 'Rumspringa', 'Pennsylvania', 'Dutch', 'running', 'around', 'Rumspringa', 'can', 'last', 'minutes', 'hours', 'days', 'weeks', 'even', 'years', 'depending', 'individual', 'time', 'are', 'allowed', 'do', 'whatever', 'like', 'drinking', 'sexual', 'relations', 'smoking', 'driving', 'cars', 'doing', 'illicit', 'drugs.One', 'such', 'person', 'Faron', '18-year-old', 'son', 'Amish', 'minister', 'been', 'parents', 'house', 'almost', 'two', 'years', 'involved', 'crystal', 'meth', 'dealers', 'order', 'support', 'own', 'drug', 'habit', 'life', 'spirals', 'control', 'parents', 'are', 'helpless', 'do', 'anything', 'Rumspringa', 'tradition', 'Faron', 'choose', 'own', 'path', 'peer', 'pressures', 'so', 'high', 'decision', 'not', 'easy', 'one', 'kids', 'who', 'want', 'explore', 'world', 'Amish', 'communities', 'grew', 'up', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'cringe', 'fear', 'Faron', 'drug', 'culture', 'nearly', 'killed', 'car', 'accident', 'eventually', 'love', 'decent', 'job', 'many', 'miles', 'away', 'parents.Other', 'kids', 'have', 'similar', 'issues', 'battle', 'more', 'internal', 'conflicts', 'external', 'pleasures', 'material', 'things', 'One', 'Velda', 'pretty', 'Amish', 'girl', 'who', 'left', 'community', 'found', 'depression', 'nesting', 'Trying', 'discover', 'who', 'was', 'help', 'family', 'church', 'down', 'dark', 'paths', 'eventually', 'life', 'finding', 'job', 'going', 'college', 'quite', 'surprise', 'considering', 'Amish', 'do', ""n't"", 'educate', 'young', '8th', 'grade', 'level.This', 'documentary', 'certainly', 'was', 'eye-opener', 'Who', 'would', ""'ve"", 'thought', 'Amish', 'deal', 'similar', 'problems', 'non-Amish', 'parents', 'are', 'forced', 'deal', 'information', 'gathered', 'film', 'makers', 'impressive', 'limited', 'Amish', 'become', 'reclusive', 'join', 'church', 'kids', 'have', 'such', 'qualms', 'being', 'filmed', 'have', 'yet', 'take', 'oath.I', 'am', 'disturbed', 'mostly', 'fact', 'Amish', 'do', ""n't"", 'educate', 'young', 'certain', 'grade', 'level', 'feel', 'too', 'much', 'pride', 'one', 'seven', 'deadly', 'sins', 'also', 'interesting', 'paradox', 'do', ""n't"", 'educate', 'kids', 'are', 'destined', 'menial', 'jobs', 'upside', 'guess', 'difficult', 'support', 'decide', 'try', 'make', 'go', 'living', 'outside', 'world', 'Not', 'surprisingly', 'return', 'rate', 'Rumspringa', 'back', 'church', '90', 'percent']",Devil's Playground
728702,AVOCNUFOXUCA6,B00007GVM0,Brian A. Schar,"[0, 1]","""Devil's Playground"" is about the rumspringa, a period in the life of Amish youth from 16 that lasts for months or years, when that youth can live as the ""english"" and experience life outside of the Amish culture.  This documentary does a good job showing this surprising aspect of Amish life.  ""Devil's Playground"" does not glamorize the life of the Amish, nor does it tear that life down; it simply tries to show it as it is.  And you learn a few things - for example, I hadn't known that Amish kids have to leave school after 8th grade.However, the narrative of the movie breaks down at times.  It wasn't until I saw the deleted scenes that I realized that one of the teenage girls we saw in several of the clips was Velda, who we meet at 23.  And the movie relies a bit too much on Faron.  Yes, the idea of an Amish meth dealer is sensational, and a hook with which to market the movie, but in many ways Velda was far more the rebel and the individualist.  (For a textbook example of the way speed messes people up, compare clean Faron with meth-addled Faron.)The rumspringa perhaps explains why Amish culture has survived for so long.  Young people are not forced into the religion, but rather must choose it for themselves.  You have to fully buy in to the church in order to join; you don't simply drift into it.  So, not only are rebels given a chance to escape, if you will, during rumspringa, those that remain have affirmatively chosen to be there.Unless you are really, really interested in the Amish, a religious studies professor, or otherwise deeply engaged with the Amish culture and community, this is more of a rent than a buy.  But it's at least worth a rent.",4,Interesting documentary,1181520000,"06 11, 2007",2007,1678,"['Devil', 'Playground', 'rumspringa', 'period', 'life', 'Amish', 'youth', '16', 'months', 'years', 'when', 'youth', 'can', 'live', 'english', 'experience', 'life', 'Amish', 'culture', 'documentary', 'good', 'job', 'showing', 'surprising', 'aspect', 'Amish', 'life', 'Devil', 'Playground', 'not', 'glamorize', 'life', 'Amish', 'tear', 'life', 'down', 'simply', 'show', 'learn', 'few', 'things', 'example', 'had', ""n't"", 'known', 'Amish', 'kids', 'have', 'leave', 'school', '8th', 'grade.However', 'narrative', 'movie', 'down', 'times', 'was', ""n't"", 'saw', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'realized', 'one', 'teenage', 'girls', 'saw', 'several', 'clips', 'was', 'Velda', 'who', 'meet', '23', 'movie', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'Faron', 'Yes', 'idea', 'Amish', 'meth', 'dealer', 'sensational', 'hook', 'market', 'movie', 'many', 'ways', 'Velda', 'was', 'far', 'more', 'rebel', 'individualist', 'textbook', 'example', 'way', 'speed', 'messes', 'people', 'up', 'compare', 'clean', 'Faron', 'meth-addled', 'Faron', 'rumspringa', 'perhaps', 'why', 'Amish', 'culture', 'survived', 'so', 'long', 'Young', 'people', 'are', 'not', 'forced', 'religion', 'rather', 'must', 'choose', 'have', 'fully', 'buy', 'church', 'order', 'join', 'do', ""n't"", 'simply', 'drift', 'So', 'not', 'only', 'are', 'rebels', 'given', 'chance', 'escape', 'will', 'rumspringa', 'remain', 'have', 'affirmatively', 'chosen', 'be', 'there.Unless', 'are', 'really', 'really', 'interested', 'Amish', 'religious', 'studies', 'professor', 'otherwise', 'deeply', 'engaged', 'Amish', 'culture', 'community', 'more', 'rent', 'buy', 'least', 'rent']",Devil's Playground
728703,A141HP4LYPWMSR,B00007GVM0,Brian E. Erland,"[0, 1]","Synopsis: The '02 documentary film `Devil's Playground' is a surprisingly revealing look behind the black hats, beards and bonnets of the Amish enigma as it focuses on five young adults during a transitional period called ""rumspringa""( meaning: running around). The Amish believe baptism is only valid when one is old enough to make a rational, mature decision on their own.Between the ages of sixteen and early to mid-twenties (it varies with the individual) is a time of experimentation when Amish young people are allowed to see how the rest of the world lives. They smoke, drink, drive cars, date non-Amish, take drugs and party. It is nothing short of a modern day ""rites of passage"" when each must decide for themselves to make the decision to renounce what the outside world has to offer and return to the community of believers, or leave behind everything they have known to embrace a new life.The five who must decide their future are; Faron and his girlfriend Emma, Gerald, Velda and Joann. The camera follows them about on their daily activities as they reflect on the life in their community and the allure of the new world they have been recently thrust into. Who will return to and who will leave is the question that will keep you watching to the end.Critique: The first thing I'd like to do is offer my congratulations to the producers of this film. How they ever attained to permission and Amish cooperation to make this documentary was quite an accomplishment. I consider myself an individual well versed in the field of religions but must admit to knowing almost nothing about the social and communal practices of this faith before watching this film. It was a real eye-opener. For some reason I never considered the possibility of an interim period like ""rumspringa"" to exist. I just assumed that youth just flowed into adolescence, then into adulthood without any special upheaval or chaos in-between. Yes some would leave the community occasionally but I would have never expected such a turbulent, chaotic time of experimentation and decision making. Little did I know.`Devil's Playground' is definitely an informative and fascinating glimpse into the beliefs, life, and practices of the Amish. For that reason alone it is worth watching. If I were to point out any negatives in the production I would say 1- it's a little slow at times and easy to loose focus and 2- in my opinion they spent too much camera time on the drug dealing, crank addict Faron. I would have liked to see more of the others, especially the more articulate and introspective Velda.",4,"""Rejoice Oh Young Man In Thy Youth"" ~ Amish Kids Have The Best Parties",1225411200,"10 31, 2008",2008,2579,"['Synopsis', ""'02"", 'documentary', 'film', 'Devil', 'Playground', 'surprisingly', 'revealing', 'look', 'black', 'hats', 'beards', 'bonnets', 'Amish', 'enigma', 'five', 'young', 'adults', 'transitional', 'period', 'called', 'rumspringa', 'meaning', 'running', 'around', 'Amish', 'believe', 'baptism', 'only', 'valid', 'when', 'one', 'old', 'enough', 'make', 'rational', 'mature', 'decision', 'own.Between', 'ages', 'sixteen', 'early', 'mid-twenties', 'individual', 'time', 'experimentation', 'when', 'Amish', 'young', 'people', 'are', 'allowed', 'see', 'how', 'rest', 'world', 'smoke', 'drink', 'drive', 'cars', 'date', 'non-Amish', 'take', 'drugs', 'party', 'nothing', 'short', 'modern', 'day', 'rites', 'passage', 'when', 'must', 'decide', 'make', 'decision', 'renounce', 'what', 'outside', 'world', 'offer', 'return', 'community', 'believers', 'leave', 'everything', 'have', 'known', 'embrace', 'new', 'life.The', 'five', 'who', 'must', 'decide', 'future', 'are', 'Faron', 'girlfriend', 'Emma', 'Gerald', 'Velda', 'Joann', 'camera', 'daily', 'activities', 'reflect', 'life', 'community', 'allure', 'new', 'world', 'have', 'been', 'recently', 'thrust', 'Who', 'will', 'return', 'who', 'will', 'leave', 'question', 'will', 'keep', 'watching', 'end.Critique', 'first', 'thing', ""'d"", 'like', 'do', 'offer', 'congratulations', 'producers', 'film', 'How', 'ever', 'attained', 'permission', 'Amish', 'cooperation', 'make', 'documentary', 'was', 'quite', 'accomplishment', 'consider', 'individual', 'well', 'versed', 'field', 'religions', 'must', 'admit', 'knowing', 'almost', 'nothing', 'social', 'communal', 'practices', 'faith', 'watching', 'film', 'was', 'real', 'eye-opener', 'reason', 'never', 'considered', 'possibility', 'interim', 'period', 'rumspringa', 'exist', 'just', 'assumed', 'youth', 'just', 'flowed', 'adolescence', 'then', 'adulthood', 'special', 'upheaval', 'chaos', 'in-between', 'would', 'leave', 'community', 'occasionally', 'would', 'have', 'never', 'expected', 'turbulent', 'chaotic', 'time', 'experimentation', 'decision', 'making', 'Little', 'did', 'know.', 'Devil', 'Playground', 'definitely', 'informative', 'fascinating', 'glimpse', 'beliefs', 'life', 'practices', 'Amish', 'reason', 'alone', 'worth', 'watching', 'were', 'point', 'out', 'negatives', 'production', 'would', 'say', '1-', 'little', 'slow', 'times', 'easy', 'loose', 'focus', '2-', 'opinion', 'spent', 'too', 'much', 'camera', 'time', 'drug', 'dealing', 'crank', 'addict', 'Faron', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'see', 'more', 'others', 'especially', 'more', 'articulate', 'introspective', 'Velda']",Devil's Playground

But there are differences. In ""Sons of Perdition"" the young people (most often young men) seek to escape a Fundamental Latter Day Saints church that has been ruled for years by the despotic but charismatic Warren Jeffs. ""Devil's Playground,"" on the other hand, explores the Amish tradition of Rumspringa, in which 16-year-olds are actually ALLOWED to do the mischievous things teens in the outer world take for granted. Problem is, these teens have very little social context in which to do those things the was most secular teens do, so they end up going stark raving NUTS.

728707,A3BEF4IHWI0VC,B00007GVM0,Chris Luallen,"[1, 2]","This documentary explores the Amish ritual of Rumspringa. This is when Amish youth reach age 16 and are allowed to enter the ""English world"" and to experience all it's temptations such as drinking, drugs and sex.The doc focuses on Faron, an Amish teen who's Rumpspringa experience has led him to become a meth addict who also deals drugs to pay for his habit. He gets busted but avoids jail time by turning evidence on some other local dealers. Obviously, this puts him in physical danger and he heads for the safety of life back home. Faron eventually leaves again to follow a girlfriend who has moved to Florida. There he succeeds in staying clean but faces setbacks in his attempts to ""make it"" in the outside world.Velda is another teen that the doc features. She is an intelligent, independent young woman who has suffered from depression while growing up Amish. She comes across as a determined and inspirational figure who succeeds in getting into a college in Texas, a terrific accomplishment since Amish are not allowed to attend school beyond the 8th grade.Nearly all the kids seem to be good hearted and I really found myself pulling for them. But I also ended up with some very mixed feelings about the adult Amish community. Of course, it's easy to feel a sort of romantic nostalgia for the simple country life they live, far away from the materialistic and competitive excesses of the modern world. But I do have a serious problem with the fact that they discontinue education at the 8th grade. This obviously leaves young minds underdeveloped and puts the kids at a severe disadvantage when it comes to suceeding in the outside world. Also the Amish are a very strict fundamentalist religious sect who teach their young people that they must remain Amish to enter Heaven. If they do choose to live in the ""English world"" they are dooming themselves to eternity in Hell. This sort of judgemental and punishment based religious theology I find extremely disturbing.But the documentary itself is both tremendously educational and entertaining.

728708,AS558SNWF1DXG,B00007GVM0,Clare Quilty,"[34, 36]","The subject matter of ""Devil's Playground"" makes it sound like a bad comedy sketch: It's about Amish kids gone wild.That description evokes images of girls in white bonnets partying down, and chain-smoking boys cruising around in their buggies. And while the movie does in fact present such scenes, it's actually a serious, non-glamorizing, non-patronizing look at cultures, religion and youth.When children in the Amish community turn 16, they enter a period called rumspringa, during which they're exempt from the restrictions of the church and are allowed to experience the outside world before deciding whether or not they want to permanently commit to the Amish way of life - they have to face temptation before they can reject it.And the teens in ""Devil's Playground"" almost immediately take to temptation and what they call the ""English"" culture like nobody's business.

Faron's ups-and-downs are vividly chronicled, and even when he's making terrible decisions he's an interesting and articulate presence.By the end of the movie - at which point it's claimed that about 90% of Amish teens do eventually commit to their religion for life - he's become an unlikely but sympathetic spokesperson for a group he appears to be leaving behind.""Devil's Playground"" is a surprisingly sober, thoughtful and provocative film that casts an objective eye on an unusual phenomenon.

He has been taught that he will go to hell unless he lives and dies in the Amish church, but the pull of the world proves very seductive. Faron's buddy Gerald expresses the same nihilistic attitude--he's pretty sure he's going to hell, but that seems a long way off when beer, drugs & skater punk fashions are beckoning. Also memorable is Velda, a young woman who does the unthinkable by leaving the church after being baptized and breaking off a wedding. Disowned by her family & all her former community, she is successfully building a life for herself that includes a job & college. Her courage is remarkable. I was amazed to learn that these Amish young people, when dressed &quot;English&quot; are virtually indistinguishable from other American teens--how do they pick up the vernacular of the street with no access to TV, movies, popular music or other non-Amish kids? How do the boys obtain money for cars & driving lessons? Where do all the beer & cigarettes & drugs come from? They take to the activities that regular teens grow up doing like ducks to water, leading me to believe that the Amish are not as 'separate' as their elders would like to believe.

728714,AC06F0LPHI1TW,B00007GVM0,K Scheffler,"[7, 9]","I suppose that I have a somewhat overidealized appreciation for the Amish, and when I first heard about this documentary I figured it was just a sensationalistic attempt at exploitation. I had no intention of watching it, but a few years later after reading Rumspringa, I finally decided to see what it was all about. I'll admit, the first time it really shocked me, and I considered it to be just what I had expected it to be. I watched it again several times, my feelings about it unchanged; after shelving it for about six months, I've watched it again a number of times, and my attitude towards it has change a little. I no longer consider it to be ""exploitation"" as it does try to depict the Amish in a somewhat sympathetic manner, and in some respects the true underlying goodness of the Amish people filters through despite the movie's subject matter. Having listened to the commentary--which is essential if you really want to understand the documentary itself--it does strike me, though, that the movie has to be viewed with a critical eye. While the type of behaviour depicted is clearly something that does occur among modern Amish youth, what's not clear is how widespread it is. According to the director, it took quite some time to find the people featured in the movie; no one wanted to be involved in the project at first, and so eventually it was mostly only people who were pretty fargone that did because they didn't really care anymore what people thought. So we have Faron--drug addict and dealer--as ""the main character,"" and Velda, who left the church because it wouldn't allow her to be ""the girl I want to be"" and is now is shunned by her family, figuring prominently, as well. The former extremely rare, the latter with an axe to grind. Some of the lesser ""characters"" are not as extreme, and a few even decided to join the church in the end, but it's difficult to say for sure because they don't received the same attention. Moreover, in the commentary, it's easy to tell where the director's etc. sympathies lie--praise for Velda for writing and publishing a ""feminist poem,"" critical remarks about certain Amish practices, the director's naive claim that maybe Faron would be a meth addict if he could just continue his education--not to mention the general tone of the discussion. Another thing to keep in mind: the documentary is very brief and general when it comes to Amish culture and history; it does not differentiate between the various sects, for instance. Of lesser significance, the inclusion of home movie clips does not make it clear that these people are not related to anyone in the movie, nor are they in fact even Amish. I understand why they were included, but it seems a little deceptive to me; well, I think they could have been left out altogether, or included as extras. So in the end, I'm left with mixed feelings about the movie; it was certainly fascinating and revealing, but there is an underlying agenda and it is does not fully explore the nature of Amish culture by which the viewer can measure the behaviour depicted in it. Is this kind of behaviour really the product of being released from a strict religious culture, or is it something that these children would have engaged in anyway had they not been born Amish and thus an example of why the Amish are justified in their rigid worldview? Many will conclude from this documentary that it is the former, while I tend to think the latter is correct. In the end, I would recommend the movie, but caution that it should be viewed critically.",3,Amish youth gone wild: sympathetic or sensationalistic? - must also watch with commentary,1200182400,"01 13, 2008",2008,3552,"['suppose', 'have', 'somewhat', 'overidealized', 'appreciation', 'Amish', 'when', 'first', 'heard', 'documentary', 'figured', 'was', 'just', 'sensationalistic', 'attempt', 'exploitation', 'had', 'intention', 'watching', 'few', 'years', 'later', 'reading', 'Rumspringa', 'finally', 'decided', 'see', 'what', 'was', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'first', 'time', 'really', 'shocked', 'considered', 'be', 'just', 'what', 'had', 'expected', 'be', 'watched', 'again', 'several', 'times', 'feelings', 'unchanged', 'shelving', 'six', 'months', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'again', 'number', 'times', 'attitude', 'towards', 'change', 'little', 'no', 'longer', 'consider', 'be', 'exploitation', 'try', 'depict', 'Amish', 'somewhat', 'sympathetic', 'manner', 'respects', 'true', 'underlying', 'goodness', 'Amish', 'people', 'filters', 'movie', 'subject', 'matter', 'Having', 'listened', 'commentary', 'essential', 'really', 'want', 'understand', 'documentary', 'strike', 'though', 'movie', 'be', 'viewed', 'critical', 'eye', 'type', 'behaviour', 'depicted', 'clearly', 'something', 'occur', 'modern', 'Amish', 'youth', 'what', 'not', 'clear', 'how', 'widespread', 'According', 'director', 'took', 'quite', 'time', 'find', 'people', 'featured', 'movie', 'one', 'wanted', 'be', 'involved', 'project', 'first', 'so', 'eventually', 'was', 'mostly', 'only', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'pretty', 'fargone', 'did', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'care', 'anymore', 'what', 'people', 'thought', 'have', 'Faron', 'drug', 'addict', 'dealer', 'main', 'character', 'Velda', 'who', 'left', 'church', 'would', ""n't"", 'allow', 'be', 'girl', 'want', 'be', 'now', 'shunned', 'family', 'figuring', 'prominently', 'well', 'former', 'extremely', 'rare', 'latter', 'axe', 'grind', 'lesser', 'characters', 'are', 'not', 'extreme', 'few', 'even', 'decided', 'join', 'church', 'end', 'difficult', 'say', 'sure', 'do', ""n't"", 'received', 'same', 'attention', 'Moreover', 'commentary', 'easy', 'tell', 'where', 'director', 'etc', 'sympathies', 'lie', 'praise', 'Velda', 'writing', 'publishing', 'feminist', 'poem', 'critical', 'remarks', 'certain', 'Amish', 'practices', 'director', 'naive', 'claim', 'maybe', 'Faron', 'would', 'be', 'meth', 'addict', 'could', 'just', 'continue', 'education', 'not', 'mention', 'general', 'tone', 'discussion', 'thing', 'keep', 'mind', 'documentary', 'very', 'brief', 'general', 'when', 'Amish', 'culture', 'history', 'not', 'differentiate', 'various', 'sects', 'instance', 'lesser', 'significance', 'inclusion', 'home', 'movie', 'clips', 'not', 'make', 'clear', 'people', 'are', 'not', 'related', 'anyone', 'movie', 'are', 'fact', 'even', 'Amish', 'understand', 'why', 'were', 'included', 'little', 'deceptive', 'well', 'think', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'left', 'out', 'altogether', 'included', 'extras', 'So', 'end', ""'m"", 'left', 'mixed', 'feelings', 'movie', 'was', 'certainly', 'fascinating', 'revealing', 'underlying', 'agenda', 'not', 'fully', 'explore', 'nature', 'Amish', 'culture', 'viewer', 'can', 'measure', 'behaviour', 'depicted', 'kind', 'behaviour', 'really', 'product', 'being', 'released', 'strict', 'religious', 'culture', 'something', 'children', 'would', 'have', 'engaged', 'anyway', 'had', 'not', 'been', 'born', 'Amish', 'thus', 'example', 'why', 'Amish', 'are', 'justified', 'rigid', 'worldview', 'Many', 'will', 'conclude', 'documentary', 'former', 'tend', 'think', 'latter', 'correct', 'end', 'would', 'recommend', 'movie', 'caution', 'should', 'be', 'viewed', 'critically']",Devil's Playground
728715,A11ED8O95W2103,B00007GVM0,"lighten_up_already2 ""lighten_up_already2""","[2, 4]","OK, I got the funnies out of my system with the review's title and now I'll deal with it seriously and see if I can relate the good and not-so-good aspects of this documentary.  I'll likely not write anything that hasn't been written yet, but I'll try to do it succintly.First the good points.First, great idea for a documentary!  Who doesn't find the Amish mysterious?  What do we, who don't live near Amish communities, know about them other than maybe we saw the movie ""Witness"" many years ago, or we went furniture shopping and saw their craftsmanship on display.  Well, this film takes you up close and personal and really gives you the feeling that you're living with them for a while.  I tried to imagine what I would be like if I grew up Amish and had to make a choice between the benefits of community (and perhaps the salvation of my soul) and the benefits of living my life without all the rules that Amish must obey.  What would I do?Second, great idea to focus in on the one aspect of Amish culture that nobody would ever guess, and that's that they let their kids run wild during their teenage years, starting at age sixteen, just to see what the world is like before deciding whether or not to join the Amish church.Actually, I knew a little bit about this becuase I saw another documentary that was done years ago, and it showed Amish teenagers driving cars, a practice which they must cease and desist after joining the church, but this documentary takes it ""up to eleven"" by showing just how far the teens are allowed to stray, apparently without parental intervention.Third, I got to see that the Amish really don't reject modern technology, just the technology that destroys community.  In fact, it seems that so much of being Amish is about preserving community, and that the rejection of technology is more of a byproduct than an end in itself.  One of the bonus features was a video tour of the main subjects family home, and I saw a rather state-of-the-art furnace in the basement.  Natural gas I assume.Fourth, I just had to wonder whether the Amish really are that backward, or are they geniuses, or perhaps both.  They've pre-empted any generation gaps by simply letting their teens run wild and giving them no parental authority to rebel against.  By the time they're eighteen, many of them volunteer to be grownups and take on adult responsiblity.  What a feat!Now for the not-so-good.I really wish something like this had been done by the people who do the PBS ""frontline"" series.  That would have made an intriguing idea into a genuinly compelling documentary, but instead there were seemingly endless minutes of one particulary messed up kid blabbering on and on and on and on.  I think it may have been a mistake, and the downfall of this project, to concentrate on one young person, and one of the most troubled at that.  Seeing footage of other teens and parents was the relief and what kept me going through the whole thing.Second, it just plain needed more Amish teens and tighter editing.  It was tedious to watch a lot of this, and there was more than enough subject matter to keep this from happening.  More views from the parental side might have helped, for example.So the bottom line is that I'm glad I watched it, but I'll never likely want to watch it again.  One trip to the ""Devil's Playground"" is enough for me.",3,Party like it's 1699!,1194825600,"11 12, 2007",2007,3359,"['OK', 'got', 'funnies', 'system', 'review', 'title', 'now', ""'ll"", 'deal', 'seriously', 'see', 'can', 'relate', 'good', 'not-so-good', 'aspects', 'documentary', ""'ll"", 'likely', 'not', 'write', 'anything', ""n't"", 'been', 'written', 'yet', ""'ll"", 'try', 'do', 'succintly.First', 'good', 'points.First', 'great', 'idea', 'documentary', 'Who', ""n't"", 'find', 'Amish', 'mysterious', 'What', 'do', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'live', 'Amish', 'communities', 'know', 'other', 'maybe', 'saw', 'movie', 'Witness', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'went', 'furniture', 'shopping', 'saw', 'craftsmanship', 'display', 'Well', 'film', 'up', 'close', 'personal', 'really', 'feeling', ""'re"", 'living', 'while', 'tried', 'imagine', 'what', 'would', 'be', 'grew', 'up', 'Amish', 'had', 'make', 'choice', 'benefits', 'community', 'perhaps', 'salvation', 'soul', 'benefits', 'living', 'life', 'rules', 'Amish', 'must', 'obey', 'What', 'would', 'do', 'Second', 'great', 'idea', 'focus', 'one', 'aspect', 'Amish', 'culture', 'nobody', 'would', 'ever', 'guess', 'let', 'kids', 'run', 'wild', 'teenage', 'years', 'starting', 'age', 'sixteen', 'just', 'see', 'what', 'world', 'deciding', 'not', 'join', 'Amish', 'church.Actually', 'knew', 'little', 'bit', 'becuase', 'saw', 'documentary', 'was', 'done', 'years', 'ago', 'showed', 'Amish', 'teenagers', 'driving', 'cars', 'practice', 'must', 'cease', 'desist', 'joining', 'church', 'documentary', 'eleven', 'showing', 'just', 'how', 'far', 'teens', 'are', 'allowed', 'stray', 'apparently', 'parental', 'intervention.Third', 'got', 'see', 'Amish', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'reject', 'modern', 'technology', 'just', 'technology', 'community', 'fact', 'so', 'much', 'being', 'Amish', 'preserving', 'community', 'rejection', 'technology', 'more', 'byproduct', 'end', 'One', 'bonus', 'features', 'was', 'video', 'tour', 'main', 'subjects', 'family', 'home', 'saw', 'rather', 'state-of-the-art', 'furnace', 'basement', 'Natural', 'gas', 'assume.Fourth', 'just', 'had', 'wonder', 'Amish', 'really', 'are', 'backward', 'are', 'geniuses', 'perhaps', ""'ve"", 'pre-empted', 'generation', 'gaps', 'simply', 'letting', 'teens', 'run', 'wild', 'giving', 'parental', 'authority', 'rebel', 'time', ""'re"", 'eighteen', 'many', 'volunteer', 'be', 'grownups', 'take', 'adult', 'responsiblity', 'What', 'feat', 'Now', 'not-so-good.I', 'really', 'wish', 'something', 'had', 'been', 'done', 'people', 'who', 'do', 'PBS', 'frontline', 'series', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'intriguing', 'idea', 'genuinly', 'compelling', 'documentary', 'instead', 'were', 'seemingly', 'endless', 'minutes', 'one', 'particulary', 'messed', 'up', 'kid', 'blabbering', 'think', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'mistake', 'downfall', 'project', 'concentrate', 'one', 'young', 'person', 'one', 'most', 'troubled', 'Seeing', 'footage', 'other', 'teens', 'parents', 'was', 'relief', 'what', 'kept', 'going', 'whole', 'thing.Second', 'just', 'plain', 'needed', 'more', 'Amish', 'teens', 'tighter', 'editing', 'was', 'tedious', 'watch', 'lot', 'there', 'was', 'more', 'enough', 'subject', 'matter', 'keep', 'happening', 'More', 'views', 'parental', 'side', 'might', 'have', 'helped', 'bottom', 'line', ""'m"", 'glad', 'watched', ""'ll"", 'never', 'likely', 'want', 'watch', 'again', 'One', 'trip', 'Devil', 'Playground', 'enough']",Devil's Playground

Before watching this film, I had imagined that the Amish lived in their own perfectly formed bubble, isolated from the rest of the world.  While I'd never want to live like them, I had a certain amount of respect for their premodern way of life.After this film, I see the Amish in a whole new light-- as real people, with more than a touch of white trash, afflicted by the same concerns of most deeply religious folk in the Bible Belt.  Sure, their religion and way of life are more extreme, but the kids set loose at age 16 for their ""rumspringa"" are like kids everywhere-- maybe just a bit more lost at sea as a result of their strict upbringing.  When Faron struggles with meth addiction during his rumspringa, I came to appreciate the importance, and maybe necessity, of deep religiosity in some people's lives.  The amazing fact is that over 90% of these rumspringa kids return to the flock when their time is up!  Even so, the antiquated Amish religion and its aged, bearded wise men seem so quaint, so antiquated compared to the temptations of the Devil's Playground of the ""English"" (i.e., us).Watching this film is a learning experience-- the documentary is up there with ""Dark Days.""",4,Rumspringa Debauch,1123113600,"08 4, 2005",2005,1220,"['What', 'interesting', 'film', 'watching', 'film', 'had', 'imagined', 'Amish', 'lived', 'own', 'perfectly', 'formed', 'bubble', 'isolated', 'rest', 'world', ""'d"", 'never', 'want', 'live', 'had', 'certain', 'amount', 'respect', 'premodern', 'way', 'life.After', 'film', 'see', 'Amish', 'whole', 'new', 'light', 'real', 'people', 'more', 'touch', 'white', 'trash', 'afflicted', 'same', 'concerns', 'most', 'deeply', 'religious', 'folk', 'Bible', 'Belt', 'Sure', 'religion', 'way', 'life', 'are', 'more', 'extreme', 'kids', 'set', 'loose', 'age', '16', 'rumspringa', 'are', 'kids', 'everywhere', 'maybe', 'just', 'bit', 'more', 'lost', 'sea', 'result', 'strict', 'upbringing', 'When', 'Faron', 'meth', 'addiction', 'rumspringa', 'came', 'appreciate', 'importance', 'maybe', 'necessity', 'deep', 'religiosity', 'people', 'lives', 'amazing', 'fact', '90', '%', 'rumspringa', 'kids', 'return', 'flock', 'when', 'time', 'up', 'Even', 'so', 'antiquated', 'Amish', 'religion', 'aged', 'bearded', 'wise', 'men', 'seem', 'so', 'quaint', 'so', 'antiquated', 'compared', 'temptations', 'Devil', 'Playground', 'English', 'i.e.', '.Watching', 'film', 'learning', 'experience', 'documentary', 'there', 'Dark', 'Days']",Devil's Playground
728717,A2X3E8EU2KBVN8,B00007GVM0,Renee B. Fulton,"[0, 3]","I had no idea what these kids went through in growing up. This is an anthropological documentary that looks at the Amish culture and lifestyle. While many religious groups endorse some sort of ""age of accountability"" doctrine, the Amish have a specific age (16) that seems to be a high estimate for when human beings begin to consciously sin. Rumspringa is when an Amish adolescent at sixteen goes to experience the ""English"" world and, consequently, becomes lost. A part of the rumspringa experience is enjoying the luxuries of technology, but just as important to the adolescents, is enjoying the freedom of copulation and consumption of alcohol and drugs. Beyond the theological motifs, the movie raises a great many of ethical questions. For instance, if many of the Amish adolescents will not choose to join the Amish church, and thus be destined to heal, is it morally justifiable to release them out into the world? It seems that the sixteen-year-old Amish kids would benefit from being thoroughly proselytized and catechized at this age, rather than sent into an English world replete with distractions. A less ""religious"" but equally troubling ethical question consists in the moral culpability of the Amish parents for the condition of their children. One of the movie's subjects becomes addicted to drugs and begins to sell narcotics. If the Amish did not continue this tradition, these adolescents would not be pushed into such dangerous situations. As shocking as it was to see an American subculture so detached from the larger culture, it is even more shocking to see the film's final fact: the Old Order Amish church has a greater retention rate now than it did throughout much of the twentieth century.

""Devil's Playground"" is a fascinating, sometimes shocking and sometimes deep view into the clash of one form of life with another. The main theme is the practice of ""Rumspringa,"" the period when Amish teens turn 16 and are allowed to venture into the outside world and taste exactly what the vices of secular culture are. In unrestrained detail we hear and watch as these teens, kept in such a closely structured community, experiment with drugs, alcohol and sometimes just simple freedom. Anyone who thinks Amish people are not in tune with the times should see the clip of the young Amish girl talking about how much she enjoyed Ozzfest '99 and watching Godsmack peform. Yet this isn't a documentary version of ""Kids"" with endless shots of sex and debauchery, it is a powerful exploration of themes as universal as the importance of personal faith in what you believe in and when it is confronted by something that deviates from that particular form of thinking. In a way ""Devil's Playground"" speaks to all of us with the idea of finding yourself, beginning to think for yourself and make your own decisions about what route your life will take. There are heartbreaking moments when some of the confused characters here almost lose their way in a haze of pot and sadness. In a way the film may even be a commentary on the results of a community so cut off from the outside world that when someone ventures out they have no idea as to how to deal with dangerous vices. Director Lucy Walker here has made a documentary that grips soley with it's material, without the aid of fancy editing or even a great score (the music is really just simple techno touches added for mood) she brings out the feelings and doubts in these people's lives. The fact that these are real people makes the film even more riveting, especially when we see the wheels turning in these 16 year olds' minds as they literally ponder whether they will indeed go to Hell or not. ""Devil's Playground"" is full of emotion and daring investigative work, giving us a glimpse of a world we seldom are allowed into.

Devil's Playground highlights a completely-different aspect of Amish culture. The Amish force their children to drop out of school after the eighth grade (because they believe that education causes pride). When Amish youth turn 16, their families turn them out into the broader world in a ritual called rumspringa; the youths often indulge in all sorts of previously-forbidden activities (drinking, drugs, sex, driving, dressing in contemporary clothing, etc.). While the youth party, they must make a life-altering decision - whether to return to the Amish faith and promise to remain loyal for the rest of their lives.The best part of this movie is the human angle. The viewer watches as sheltered children experience the broader world. We see Amish youth who have all sorts of reactions to the sudden freedom. One woman returns to the church and accepts baptism. Another woman accepted baptism, then left the church anyway; this causes her entire family to shun her. One preacher's son becomes involved in drug dealing and cannot decide what to do with his life.  Viewers will care about these kids, each of whom faces the same life-defining choice.There are just a few areas where one could improve Devil's Playground. I would like to have an update on the kids in this film; I am sure that most of the youth returned to the Amish church, but I would enjoy knowing the details.

Apparently the Amish let their kids misbehave for a great length of time in order to show them how empty the secular world is. As one of the characters puts it towards the end ""most Amish see Rumspringa as their inoculation against the secular lifestyle.""However, this movie not only illuminates the Amish but many of the other right wing religious movements. Why do many of these right wing religious movements have hellraisers for children who grow up to carry on the tradition? I know that I was shocked when I first visited Crown Heights and saw many young Chasidic kids acting abominably - much worse than me and my friends acted when we were in our late teens/early 20s. I had been trying to emulate the frum lifestyle in all its extremism (I'm still frum but I don't follow the more right wing philosophies and halachot) and this shocked and disgusted me. Yet many of these same guys are now married, studying Torah and being good Chasidic Jews. They got over their misbehavior and even though it wasn't institutionalized Rumspringa, that's pretty much what happened.In many ways, someone raised in a repressed environment will do too much when released from the repression. And that will do a lot of harm to the individual but the institution is stronger for it.This is a great movie for anyone, but especially anyone that wants some insights into their more rightwing religiously inclined friends (and their ""hypocrisy"")",5,Actually very interesting no matter what your religious affiliation,1141776000,"03 8, 2006",2006,1631,"['documentary', 'question', 'most', 'not', 'raised', 'constrictive', 'religious', 'homes', 'ask', 'very', 'usually', 'rightwing', 'religious', 'do', 'people', 'ever', 'misbehave', 'severe', 'trauma', 'Apparently', 'Amish', 'let', 'kids', 'misbehave', 'great', 'length', 'time', 'order', 'show', 'how', 'empty', 'secular', 'world', 'one', 'characters', 'end', 'most', 'Amish', 'see', 'Rumspringa', 'inoculation', 'secular', 'lifestyle', 'However', 'movie', 'not', 'only', 'Amish', 'many', 'other', 'right', 'wing', 'religious', 'movements', 'Why', 'do', 'many', 'right', 'wing', 'religious', 'movements', 'have', 'hellraisers', 'children', 'who', 'grow', 'up', 'carry', 'tradition', 'know', 'was', 'shocked', 'when', 'first', 'visited', 'Crown', 'Heights', 'saw', 'many', 'young', 'Chasidic', 'kids', 'acting', 'abominably', 'much', 'worse', 'friends', 'acted', 'when', 'were', 'late', 'teens/early', '20s', 'had', 'been', 'trying', 'emulate', 'frum', 'lifestyle', 'extremism', ""'m"", 'still', 'frum', 'do', ""n't"", 'follow', 'more', 'right', 'wing', 'philosophies', 'halachot', 'shocked', 'disgusted', 'many', 'same', 'guys', 'are', 'now', 'married', 'studying', 'Torah', 'being', 'good', 'Chasidic', 'Jews', 'got', 'misbehavior', 'even', 'was', ""n't"", 'institutionalized', 'Rumspringa', 'pretty', 'much', 'what', 'happened.In', 'many', 'ways', 'someone', 'raised', 'repressed', 'environment', 'will', 'do', 'too', 'much', 'when', 'released', 'repression', 'will', 'do', 'lot', 'harm', 'individual', 'institution', 'stronger', 'it.This', 'great', 'movie', 'anyone', 'especially', 'anyone', 'insights', 'more', 'rightwing', 'religiously', 'inclined', 'friends', 'hypocrisy']",Devil's Playground
728725,A1HK1LRON0UJ5X,B00007GVM0,William McNeill,"[53, 56]","If all you know about the Amish comes from seeing the movie ""Witness"" or passing the occasional buggy by the side of the road, many of the images in Lucy Walker's understated documentary will be jarring.  Girls in 19th century dresses chug beer from plastic cups, a small-time Amish crank dealer hides his stash inside a matchbox, and teenagers dance at a raucous party that, apart from the white bonnets dotting the crowd, could be happening anywhere.  The great achievement of Walker's film is to show how this is all less incongruous than it seems.When Amish teenagers turn sixteen they are encouraged to leave their communities and experience the pleasures and conveniences of life in the outside ""English"" world.  This period is called Rumspringa (literally ""running around"") and is intended to ensure that the Amish who come back into the fold will have made a conscious choice to do so.  The appeal to free will is well-intentioned, but ultimately disingenuous.  When given their first taste of adult freedom, Amish teenagers do what any other teenagers do: they drink too much, have sex, and spend a lot of time driving around in cars.  For most teenagers this is just a phase.  For the Amish it's the preliminary to the most important decision of their life: whether or not to join the Amish church.  The subjects of Walker's documentary are no better prepared for the trials of adolescence than any other group of sixteen year olds, and it comes as no surprise that most of them, after a few tumultuous years, seem ready to return to a way of life that represents family, security, and a rock-solid sense of identity.Rumspringa, an Amish elder says at one point, is really a vaccination.  You get just enough of a taste of the outside world so that when you give it up you won't wonder what you're missing.  His candor is winning, as is the level-headedness of most of the Amish elders Walker interviews.  Her main subjects are the kids, but they are in many ways like deeply religious small-town kids anywhere: confused and self-obsessed, but basically decent, and given to projecting a theological dimension onto the normal pains of growing up.  Beneath the strange clothing is a familiar conflict between piety and hell-raising.It's in the interviews with Amish adults that the most intriguing aspects of Amish society are revealed.  Despite the horse-and-buggy trappings, the Amish are not opposed to technology per se, just technology that they consider disruptive to their way of life.  So cars and televisions are out, but a solar-powered battery charger is fine.  (You can imagine a hippie commune reaching a similar conclusion after much earnest debate.)  Their attitude towards sex, while hardly permissive, is surprisingly laid-back and pragmatic: a little premarital fooling around can be overlooked as long as it leads to an Amish marriage and Amish children.  The adults interviewed for this film come across as relaxed and candid, and have none of the prickly self-righteousness you find in other religious conservatives.  Their condemnations of the outside world are rote, without any real heat.  It appears that in choosing never to engage the modern world, either as participants or evangelicals, they feel little need to either judge it or defend themselves.  In their inwardness, the Amish seem more like Hasidic Jews than Christian fundamentalists.But Hassids still drive cars.  Despite their conviction, you still come away wondering how long the Amish way of life can last.  In one telling interview, a preacher bemoans the way work has changed.  Fifty years ago, he says, Amish children would have stayed home and helped out on the farm.  Now they go to work in a factory, get some money, and the next thing you know, they want to buy a car.  Now here's a battle that started back when everyone drove a horse and buggy.  For family ties and religious values to overwhelm teenage rebellion is the easy part.  The hard part comes when an agrarian way of life squares off against factory jobs and pocket money.",3,Amish Demystification,1045440000,"02 17, 2003",2003,4041,"['know', 'Amish', 'seeing', 'movie', 'Witness', 'passing', 'occasional', 'buggy', 'side', 'road', 'many', 'images', 'Lucy', 'Walker', 'understated', 'documentary', 'will', 'be', 'jarring', 'Girls', '19th', 'century', 'dresses', 'chug', 'beer', 'plastic', 'cups', 'small-time', 'Amish', 'crank', 'dealer', 'stash', 'matchbox', 'teenagers', 'dance', 'raucous', 'party', 'apart', 'white', 'bonnets', 'dotting', 'crowd', 'could', 'be', 'happening', 'anywhere', 'great', 'achievement', 'Walker', 'film', 'show', 'how', 'less', 'incongruous', 'Amish', 'teenagers', 'turn', 'sixteen', 'are', 'encouraged', 'leave', 'communities', 'experience', 'pleasures', 'conveniences', 'life', 'outside', 'English', 'world', 'period', 'called', 'Rumspringa', 'literally', 'running', 'around', 'intended', 'ensure', 'Amish', 'who', 'come', 'back', 'fold', 'will', 'have', 'made', 'conscious', 'choice', 'do', 'so', 'appeal', 'free', 'will', 'well-intentioned', 'ultimately', 'disingenuous', 'When', 'given', 'first', 'taste', 'adult', 'freedom', 'Amish', 'teenagers', 'do', 'what', 'other', 'teenagers', 'do', 'drink', 'too', 'much', 'have', 'sex', 'spend', 'lot', 'time', 'driving', 'around', 'cars', 'most', 'teenagers', 'just', 'phase', 'Amish', 'preliminary', 'most', 'important', 'decision', 'life', 'not', 'join', 'Amish', 'church', 'subjects', 'Walker', 'documentary', 'are', 'better', 'prepared', 'trials', 'adolescence', 'other', 'group', 'sixteen', 'year', 'olds', 'surprise', 'most', 'few', 'tumultuous', 'years', 'seem', 'ready', 'return', 'way', 'life', 'family', 'security', 'rock-solid', 'sense', 'identity.Rumspringa', 'Amish', 'elder', 'one', 'point', 'really', 'vaccination', 'get', 'just', 'enough', 'taste', 'outside', 'world', 'when', 'give', 'wo', ""n't"", 'wonder', 'what', ""'re"", 'missing', 'candor', 'winning', 'level-headedness', 'most', 'Amish', 'elders', 'Walker', 'interviews', 'main', 'subjects', 'are', 'kids', 'are', 'many', 'ways', 'deeply', 'religious', 'small-town', 'kids', 'anywhere', 'confused', 'self-obsessed', 'basically', 'decent', 'given', 'projecting', 'theological', 'dimension', 'normal', 'pains', 'growing', 'up', 'strange', 'clothing', 'familiar', 'conflict', 'piety', 'hell-raising.It', 'interviews', 'Amish', 'adults', 'most', 'intriguing', 'aspects', 'Amish', 'society', 'are', 'revealed', 'horse-and-buggy', 'trappings', 'Amish', 'are', 'not', 'opposed', 'technology', 'se', 'just', 'technology', 'consider', 'disruptive', 'way', 'life', 'cars', 'televisions', 'are', 'out', 'solar-powered', 'battery', 'charger', 'fine', 'can', 'imagine', 'hippie', 'commune', 'reaching', 'similar', 'conclusion', 'much', 'earnest', 'debate', 'attitude', 'towards', 'sex', 'hardly', 'permissive', 'surprisingly', 'laid-back', 'pragmatic', 'little', 'premarital', 'fooling', 'around', 'can', 'be', 'overlooked', 'as', 'long', 'Amish', 'marriage', 'Amish', 'children', 'adults', 'interviewed', 'film', 'come', 'relaxed', 'candid', 'have', 'none', 'prickly', 'self-righteousness', 'find', 'other', 'religious', 'conservatives', 'condemnations', 'outside', 'world', 'are', 'rote', 'real', 'heat', 'choosing', 'never', 'engage', 'modern', 'world', 'participants', 'evangelicals', 'feel', 'little', 'need', 'judge', 'defend', 'inwardness', 'Amish', 'seem', 'more', 'Hasidic', 'Jews', 'Christian', 'fundamentalists.But', 'Hassids', 'still', 'drive', 'cars', 'conviction', 'still', 'come', 'away', 'wondering', 'how', 'long', 'Amish', 'way', 'life', 'can', 'last', 'one', 'telling', 'interview', 'preacher', 'way', 'work', 'changed', 'Fifty', 'years', 'ago', 'Amish', 'children', 'would', 'have', 'stayed', 'home', 'helped', 'out', 'farm', 'Now', 'go', 'work', 'factory', 'get', 'money', 'next', 'thing', 'know', 'want', 'buy', 'car', 'Now', 'here', 'battle', 'started', 'back', 'when', 'everyone', 'drove', 'horse', 'buggy', 'family', 'ties', 'religious', 'values', 'overwhelm', 'teenage', 'rebellion', 'easy', 'part', 'hard', 'part', 'when', 'agrarian', 'way', 'life', 'squares', 'off', 'factory', 'jobs', 'pocket', 'money']",Devil's Playground
