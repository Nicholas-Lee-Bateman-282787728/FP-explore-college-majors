This fine documentary reflects the life of a hard-working woman who was ahead of her times.  She asserted the rights of women unannounced and with such class from the snappy Hildy in &#34;His Girl Friday&#34; to the woman past her prime and desperate for love in &#34;Picnic.&#34; and on and on; because her  real life was a struggle against almost impossible odds in a Hollywood where men moguls ruled the day.  She finished up strong in her struggles with serious illnesses  (before better treatments) yet left us all too soon.,4,Great star among many!,1387411200,"12 19, 2013",2013,587,"['would', 'like', 'see', 'more', 'even', 'life', 'made', 'film', 'fine', 'documentary', 'life', 'hard-working', 'woman', 'who', 'was', 'ahead', 'times', 'asserted', 'rights', 'women', 'unannounced', 'such', 'class', 'snappy', 'Hildy', '34', 'Girl', 'Friday', '34', 'woman', 'prime', 'desperate', 'love', '34', 'Picnic.', '34', 'real', 'life', 'was', 'struggle', 'almost', 'impossible', 'odds', 'Hollywood', 'where', 'men', 'moguls', 'ruled', 'day', 'finished', 'up', 'strong', 'struggles', 'serious', 'illnesses', 'better', 'treatments', 'yet', 'left', 'too', 'soon']",Life is a Banquet: The Rosalind Russell Story

I visited the cemetary where she is buried and there is a huge cross marking her resting place.
