1437891,AOODJRORQW6MT,B0052MXIYG,A. Yee,"[1, 1]","The Get Along Gang wasn't the funniest or most well-written cartoon in history...The humor and storywriting were simple and  tame and the animation had its share of glitches.  Yet, the show and the characters resonate in memory...and often shown in reruns for many years after its CBS network run.The concept of animal kids living in something of a ""real world"" small town setting (circa 1980s) did have great potential for gentle identifiable humor.  There wasn't any fantasy world gimmickry and the kids didn't have super magical powers.  They lived their day to day life through their eyes as kids...making mistakes from time to time and trying to help each other out of trouble... and they remained friends no matter what differences or disagreements they might have.While critics might complain about the ""conformity"" aspect of the show (that the gang kids all had to agree on the same thing in every story),  moral dilemmas like obeying the law, helping someone, or saving valuable things from destruction might make saying ""no"" against the gang's majority feelings a non-option...if one has a conscience.Do the right thing...or act like a jerk.  Luckily the kids choose the former.While it is disappointing to have the first 10 half hour programs (two 10 minute stories per half hour), the remaining 3 episodes can be found in the ""TV Toons To Go"" compilation from the same manufacturer.  Well worth the cost to buy for fans and for those new viewers who want to experience an example of the fondly remembered 80s tv cartoon boom.",5,Animal Kids in the Real World,1388966400,"01 6, 2014",2014,1537,"['Get', 'Along', 'Gang', 'was', ""n't"", 'funniest', 'most', 'well-written', 'cartoon', 'history', 'humor', 'storywriting', 'were', 'simple', 'tame', 'animation', 'had', 'share', 'glitches', 'show', 'characters', 'resonate', 'memory', 'often', 'shown', 'reruns', 'many', 'years', 'CBS', 'network', 'run.The', 'concept', 'animal', 'kids', 'living', 'something', 'real', 'world', 'small', 'town', 'setting', 'circa', '1980s', 'did', 'have', 'great', 'potential', 'gentle', 'identifiable', 'humor', 'was', ""n't"", 'fantasy', 'world', 'gimmickry', 'kids', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'super', 'magical', 'powers', 'lived', 'day', 'day', 'life', 'eyes', 'kids', 'making', 'mistakes', 'time', 'time', 'trying', 'help', 'other', 'trouble', 'remained', 'matter', 'what', 'disagreements', 'might', 'have.While', 'critics', 'might', 'complain', 'conformity', 'aspect', 'show', 'gang', 'kids', 'had', 'agree', 'same', 'thing', 'story', 'moral', 'dilemmas', 'obeying', 'law', 'helping', 'someone', 'saving', 'valuable', 'things', 'destruction', 'might', 'make', 'saying', 'gang', 'majority', 'non-option', 'one', 'conscience.Do', 'right', 'thing', 'act', 'jerk', 'Luckily', 'kids', 'choose', 'former.While', 'disappointing', 'have', 'first', '10', 'half', 'hour', 'programs', 'two', '10', 'minute', 'stories', 'hour', 'remaining', '3', 'episodes', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'TV', 'Toons', 'Go', 'compilation', 'same', 'manufacturer', 'Well', 'cost', 'buy', 'fans', 'new', 'viewers', 'who', 'want', 'experience', 'example', 'fondly', 'remembered', '80s', 'tv', 'cartoon', 'boom']",Best of the Get Along Gang

1437899,A1TR9417Z4U72F,B0052MXIYG,"S. M. Robare ""smurfwreck""","[11, 12]","The Get Along Gang is truly one of the staples of Saturday Morning Cartoons from the 1980s, and it bridged the gap between action fare (like Dungeons & Dragons or Mr. T) and the more ""good for you"" content of PBS (like Mr. Rodgers or Sesame Street.)  Originally created for a series of greeting cards (much like another anthropomorphic set of critters, the Shirt Tales) and stationary, these characters made their first jump to the small screen on Nickelodeon back in 1984 in a single pilot episode created by the Nelvana company.  When the shop was picked up for a series it was brought over to DiC Animation and then aired on CBS for three seasons consisting of a total of 13 episodes (each with two 11 minute segments.)The series centers around 6 main characters, Monty (the moose), Dotty (the dog), Woolma (a sheep), Zipper (a cat), Bingo (a beaver), and Portia (a porcupine) who hang out in a train caboose clubhouse and have adventures around their town.  Each episode typically features a moral of good behavior, as well as a run in with the town bully Catchum (an aligator) and his toady Leland (a lizard.)This is the firs time the series has been released on DVD in the US and it features 10 of the 13 original episodes.  It also excludes the original pilot episode.  The quality of the transfer seems to be at VHS quality.Personally, though I'm extremely glad to finally have this DVD in my collection I find it odd that Cookie Jar/Millcreek didn't include a second disc with the final three episodes.  At such a low MSRP for these 10 I can't imagine them putting out a second disc with only three episodes for a couple bucks.  I guess most of the episodes are better than none though...",3,Awesome for nostalgia addicts ofthe 80s...,1311897600,"07 29, 2011",2011,1697,"['Get', 'Along', 'Gang', 'truly', 'one', 'staples', 'Saturday', 'Morning', 'Cartoons', '1980s', 'bridged', 'gap', 'action', 'fare', 'Dungeons', 'Dragons', 'Mr.', 'T', 'more', 'good', 'content', 'PBS', 'Mr.', 'Rodgers', 'Sesame', 'Street', 'Originally', 'created', 'series', 'greeting', 'cards', 'much', 'anthropomorphic', 'set', 'critters', 'Shirt', 'Tales', 'stationary', 'characters', 'made', 'first', 'jump', 'small', 'screen', 'Nickelodeon', 'back', '1984', 'single', 'pilot', 'episode', 'created', 'Nelvana', 'company', 'When', 'shop', 'was', 'picked', 'up', 'series', 'was', 'brought', 'over', 'DiC', 'Animation', 'then', 'aired', 'CBS', 'three', 'seasons', 'consisting', 'total', '13', 'episodes', 'two', '11', 'minute', 'segments', 'series', 'centers', '6', 'main', 'characters', 'Monty', 'moose', 'Dotty', 'dog', 'Woolma', 'sheep', 'Zipper', 'cat', 'Bingo', 'beaver', 'Portia', 'porcupine', 'who', 'hang', 'out', 'train', 'caboose', 'clubhouse', 'have', 'adventures', 'around', 'town', 'episode', 'typically', 'moral', 'good', 'behavior', 'as', 'well', 'run', 'town', 'bully', 'Catchum', 'aligator', 'toady', 'Leland', 'lizard', 'firs', 'time', 'series', 'been', 'released', 'DVD', 'US', '10', '13', 'original', 'episodes', 'also', 'original', 'pilot', 'episode', 'quality', 'transfer', 'be', 'VHS', 'quality.Personally', ""'m"", 'extremely', 'glad', 'finally', 'have', 'DVD', 'collection', 'find', 'Cookie', 'Jar/Millcreek', 'did', ""n't"", 'include', 'second', 'disc', 'final', 'three', 'episodes', 'low', 'MSRP', '10', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'putting', 'out', 'second', 'disc', 'only', 'three', 'episodes', 'couple', 'bucks', 'guess', 'most', 'episodes', 'are', 'better', 'none']",Best of the Get Along Gang
