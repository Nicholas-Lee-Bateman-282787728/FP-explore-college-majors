668056,A28S3Y2UYTP4XK,B00005NG0M,C. Conkey,"[3, 3]",Very nice DVD of Collective Soul. As a big CS fan I was very interested in getting a DVD of them performing their music. Only slight negative was the lack of their formal electric based equipment (which is fully noted on the DVD description). The acoustic versions are nice but don't have the punch of the full band based versions. I still recommend - can't go wrong for $9.99.,4,Very pleasant DVD,1122940800,"08 2, 2005",2005,377,"['Very', 'nice', 'DVD', 'Collective', 'Soul', 'big', 'CS', 'fan', 'was', 'very', 'interested', 'getting', 'DVD', 'performing', 'music', 'Only', 'slight', 'negative', 'was', 'lack', 'formal', 'electric', 'based', 'equipment', 'fully', 'noted', 'DVD', 'description', 'acoustic', 'versions', 'are', 'nice', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'punch', 'full', 'band', 'based', 'versions', 'still', 'recommend', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'wrong', '9.99']",Ross Childress: Music in High Places - Collective Soul - Live from Morocco

The director used a unique way of filming for the whole video; it was a very ""live"" look to the shots, and creative way of laying the guys singing and shots of Morocco.I also enjoyed the acoustic sound of Collctive Soul songs, it gives everything a different spin to some well loved, and often heard songs. Not to mention Ed Roland sounds pretty much the same singing here as he does for a ""perfect conditions"" music studio. That can't always be said for some artists, when they get outside of a music studio, into the rest of the world!And one last note; The guys of CS are really pretty funny to watch. They seemed to be very relaxed and appreciative of seeing another part of the world and way of living.",5,Morocco = More Rock,1140134400,"02 17, 2006",2006,784,"['really', 'enjoyed', 'beautiful', 'exotic', 'location', 'Morocco', 'show', 'director', 'used', 'unique', 'way', 'filming', 'whole', 'video', 'was', 'very', 'live', 'look', 'shots', 'creative', 'way', 'laying', 'guys', 'singing', 'shots', 'Morocco.I', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'acoustic', 'sound', 'Collctive', 'Soul', 'songs', 'everything', 'different', 'spin', 'well', 'loved', 'often', 'heard', 'songs', 'Not', 'mention', 'Ed', 'Roland', 'pretty', 'much', 'same', 'singing', 'here', 'perfect', 'conditions', 'music', 'studio', 'ca', ""n't"", 'always', 'be', 'said', 'artists', 'when', 'get', 'music', 'studio', 'rest', 'world', 'one', 'last', 'note', 'guys', 'CS', 'are', 'really', 'pretty', 'funny', 'watch', 'seemed', 'be', 'very', 'relaxed', 'appreciative', 'seeing', 'part', 'world', 'way', 'living']",Ross Childress: Music in High Places - Collective Soul - Live from Morocco

BEAUTIFUL SETTING AND EARLY DAYS OF WHEN THE BAND HAD SHANE AND ROSS WHO I ABSOLUTELY LOVE WITH COLLECTIVE SOUL. ALL ORIGINAL MEMBERS OF THE BAND AS I REMEMBER THEM.

668059,A20M1Q315WG5KT,B00005NG0M,"Juan Isava ""Chinman 1977""","[1, 1]","I am a C.S. fan since I first listened to ""Hints, Allegations and Things Left Unsaid""; man are these a bunch of great musicians with power lyrics and some thrilling songs. They actually came down here to Venezuela to play along with Oasis and I actually was in disbelief when these guys played first, opening for the other band....their abilities and dedication is simply unbelievable. I was able to meet their lead and rythm guitar players at a club the night before the concert and was really amazed how down to earth these guys really are.That been said, lets go on to this DVD. I've always known these folks would sound perfect on acoustic performances, but this DVD gives you the chance to get inside these guys perceptions about a different culture, reactions (the monkey part is really funny)and simple knowledge about a new place (never been to Morocco actually) all this while playing their all time inspiring music in breathtaking scenarios, you couldn't ask for more. Look how music bonds, unites people from different backgrounds (the kids dancing around in Gel is simply hilarious). My personal favorite (and I am going over the edge here cuz ALL the songs ROCK) is ""After All""- the last song if you play JUST THE MUSIC- because both singer and guitar players are so IN to the song the the lyrics jump out of the TV's speakers and the guitars play those sad melodies that keep you in their grasp until they fade.Must have record.

Some nice footage, and this is the only available official visual document (aside from music videos/TV performances/Woodstock 94 & 99 maybe) of the original band lineup, which is cool.However, the thing to know here is that this isn't an ""optimized"" unplugged type of setting. I'm not referring to the fact that these are ""on location"" performances and obviously not in a conventional concert venue. Rather, it seems like most of the arrangements for the songs are the same as the regular electric arrangements, except that here the guy are just playing a bunch of acoustic guitars and hand drums. Again, nothing wrong with that, but this feels very off-the-cuff, like you are hanging out with the guys for an impromptou campfire jam or something, not a fully-realized, re-imangined ""unplugged"" performance (which I'd still like to see the band do at some point).",3,Decent for What It Is,1395273600,"03 20, 2014",2014,985,"[""'m"", 'huge', 'Collective', 'Soul', 'fan', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'love', 'video', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'se', 'nice', 'footage', 'only', 'available', 'official', 'visual', 'document', 'music', 'videos/TV', 'performances/Woodstock', '94', '99', 'maybe', 'original', 'band', 'lineup', 'cool.However', 'thing', 'know', 'here', ""n't"", 'optimized', 'unplugged', 'type', 'setting', ""'m"", 'not', 'referring', 'fact', 'are', 'location', 'performances', 'obviously', 'not', 'conventional', 'concert', 'venue', 'Rather', 'most', 'arrangements', 'songs', 'are', 'same', 'regular', 'electric', 'arrangements', 'here', 'guy', 'are', 'just', 'playing', 'bunch', 'acoustic', 'guitars', 'hand', 'drums', 'Again', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'feels', 'very', 'off-the-cuff', 'are', 'hanging', 'out', 'guys', 'impromptou', 'campfire', 'jam', 'something', 'not', 'fully-realized', 're-imangined', 'unplugged', 'performance', ""'d"", 'still', 'like', 'see', 'band', 'do', 'point']",Ross Childress: Music in High Places - Collective Soul - Live from Morocco
