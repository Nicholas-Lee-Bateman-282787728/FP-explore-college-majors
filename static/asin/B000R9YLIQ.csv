1080854,A2OU9Y8IE1M8UL,B000R9YLIQ,"Amazon Customer ""Kimberly""","[6, 7]","This is my favorite workout in my third trimester.  It keeps me feeling good.  I attribute this workout and the others I do to the reason I am still so mobile and able to do things almost like I usually do. It completely loosens everything up.  Say goodbye to backaches and all those other pregnancy aches. I really like the prenatal modification for sun salutations, it is much more effective than the versions on my other workouts.  This is a little slow for first and second tri if you usually exercise.  If you want a more challenging 1st and 2nd tri workout try Kira Landgolf's Total Body Tone or Erin O'Brian's Prenatal Fitness Fix.  I learned the hard way to stick with prenatal workouts in pregnancy, regardless of how good you may feel.  I tore a muscle from overdoing (tricked by the relaxin I guess) during a regular workout.  It took over a month to heal.  I haven't tried the postnatal workout yet, I'll add a review when I get to that point.  This DVD was very worth it.  Other good prenatal workouts include Shiva Rea's prenatal yoga and Crunch Yoga Mama.  They are good quality, I used them during both of my pregnancies. If you are an experienced exerciser, they are really best for third tri.  Try the ones I recommended above for the earlier days or just go for brisk walks (Leslie Sansone's walking workouts have been great too!)",5,Love it!,1226793600,"11 16, 2008",2008,1349,"['favorite', 'workout', 'third', 'trimester', 'feeling', 'good', 'attribute', 'workout', 'others', 'do', 'reason', 'am', 'still', 'so', 'mobile', 'able', 'do', 'things', 'almost', 'usually', 'do', 'completely', 'everything', 'up', 'Say', 'goodbye', 'backaches', 'other', 'pregnancy', 'aches', 'really', 'prenatal', 'modification', 'sun', 'salutations', 'much', 'more', 'effective', 'versions', 'other', 'workouts', 'little', 'slow', 'first', 'second', 'tri', 'usually', 'exercise', 'want', 'more', 'challenging', '1st', '2nd', 'tri', 'workout', 'try', 'Kira', 'Landgolf', 'Total', 'Body', 'Tone', 'Erin', ""O'Brian"", 'Prenatal', 'Fitness', 'Fix', 'learned', 'hard', 'way', 'stick', 'prenatal', 'workouts', 'pregnancy', 'regardless', 'how', 'good', 'may', 'feel', 'tore', 'muscle', 'overdoing', 'tricked', 'relaxin', 'guess', 'regular', 'workout', 'took', 'over', 'month', 'heal', 'have', ""n't"", 'tried', 'postnatal', 'workout', 'yet', ""'ll"", 'add', 'review', 'when', 'get', 'point', 'DVD', 'was', 'very', 'worth', 'Other', 'good', 'prenatal', 'workouts', 'include', 'Shiva', 'Rea', 'prenatal', 'yoga', 'Crunch', 'Yoga', 'Mama', 'are', 'good', 'quality', 'used', 'pregnancies', 'are', 'experienced', 'exerciser', 'are', 'really', 'best', 'third', 'tri', 'Try', 'ones', 'recommended', 'earlier', 'days', 'just', 'go', 'brisk', 'walks', 'Leslie', 'Sansone', 'walking', 'workouts', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'too']",Yoga Pregnancy

1080857,AOTMP0OKJOUWI,B000R9YLIQ,"Emily J. Morris ""Backroads""","[0, 0]","I've been trying a few pregnancy yoga DVDs and so far this one is my favorite.  This presents a workout (nothing fancy, I'd say beginner's level) that is more about the yoga practice than it is about the pregenancy label.  So while there is an extremely pregnant woman to follow, very little of this is overly simplified catering service.  This program is reasonable, seems safe for a normal and healthy pregnancy, and keeps up at a good pace for a wonderful workout.  The post-natal workout is a little more intense, and even though I'm still pregnant, I'm impressed by it; it's nice to have a yoga DVD one can use for longer than 9 months.  The instructors carry no bells and whistles--it's relaxing to watch without getting too crunchy, and I finished this pregnancy-friendly program without feeling I was overworked but rather had an effective workout.",5,"Novice friendly, pregnancy friendly, and still great workouts",1346716800,"09 4, 2012",2012,856,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'trying', 'few', 'pregnancy', 'yoga', 'DVDs', 'so', 'far', 'one', 'favorite', 'workout', 'nothing', 'fancy', ""'d"", 'say', 'beginner', 'level', 'more', 'yoga', 'practice', 'pregenancy', 'label', 'So', 'extremely', 'pregnant', 'woman', 'follow', 'very', 'little', 'overly', 'simplified', 'catering', 'service', 'program', 'reasonable', 'safe', 'normal', 'healthy', 'pregnancy', 'up', 'good', 'pace', 'wonderful', 'workout', 'post-natal', 'workout', 'little', 'more', 'intense', 'even', ""'m"", 'still', 'pregnant', ""'m"", 'impressed', 'nice', 'have', 'yoga', 'DVD', 'one', 'can', 'use', 'longer', '9', 'months', 'instructors', 'carry', 'bells', 'whistles', 'relaxing', 'watch', 'getting', 'too', 'crunchy', 'finished', 'pregnancy-friendly', 'program', 'feeling', 'was', 'overworked', 'rather', 'had', 'effective', 'workout']",Yoga Pregnancy

(When I will take out the post-natal workout and screen it, too) I have just been informed of, and now done extensive research myself on diastis recti (DR). Please, please beware, there are too many poses which stretch, twist or work your abs/lower torso for this video to be a completely safe pregnancy workout. Stretching only throughout the range which is comfortable for you, does not protect you from DR. 1/3 of first time moms and 2/3 of second-time Moms experience some form of diastis recti. Even if you have no signs currently, during birth and right after birth (with the counterweight of your baby gone) DR may show up. To protect yourself skip the side stretches, the down dogs, the right angle poses, the twists (and planks). To do that in this video, means sitting out 90% of the video. I can't believe that the choreographer/consultants didn't pay more attention to real health issues when they put this together.

This 30 minute DVD is the perfect amount of time for me. The instructor is also very encouraging & inviting. The first time I tried this workout, I didn't feel much of a burn at all but the second time around, I tried to focus my breathing better and corrected myself on some of the poses, which made a huge difference in how I felt afterwards. It's true that this workout will not raise your heartrate much. The poses are more for strength or flexibility building. I always feel great after and that's what keeps me coming back to the DVD day after day.
