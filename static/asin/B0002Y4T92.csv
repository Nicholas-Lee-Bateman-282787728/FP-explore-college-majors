850209,A28WI6XVNPOHDR,B0002Y4T92,alper ercan,"[4, 6]","I like Clapton...I like Clapton as a guitarist, as a musician,I like his personality and I appreciate not only what he did for blues, but also his assemblying such a huge event. I also liked this DVD, but I can't help but think that this DVD could have been, or given the quality of the musicians performing, SHOULD have been better.Everybody has got their own taste in music, so it's normal for one to ask questions like "" Where is E.Van Halen, Jimmy Page, Ritchie Blackmore, Al di Meola, Steve Morse, Joe Satriani, Gary Moore, Brian May, Eric Gales,Gales Bros, Walter Trout, Steve Lukather?"" as the name of the festival is ""Guitar Festival"" and these names represent the meaning of ""guitar"" for many people, notwithstanding my respect for the guitar players who took part at the festival.We have legends like , Santana, Robert Cray, Steve Vai, Eric Johnson, John Mac Laughlin, BB King, Jeff Beck(was he there actually?) and Buddy Guy and that's wonderful, but they are covered for only one song each (Jam sessions do not count), and they definitely deserved more coverage than some of the others, such as the ones singing about what they like about Oklahoma girls, why they prefer the Oklahoma girls over the Texas girls, what the cowgirls do and the consequential results, etc...We have great non-guitarist musicians, or should I say legends in their own field of interest like Dennis Chambers, Donald Dunn and Steve Gadd playing at the festival, which is great, but unfortunately they didn't get noteworthy spotlight (check out Dennis Chambers' solo during John mc Laughlin's set, we can see anything, including ladies with sexy outfits, but we can't see the solo of the best drummer in the world, perfect camera selection(!))

But the strength of variety is also the greatest weakness.In some ways you do not want to criticise as there really are some superb tracks on this double DVD. The frustration for those like me who couldn't be there is that we missed so much. You can't help noticing this during the DVD. I saw Pat Metheny being hugged but didn't hear a note from him, as others have noted the great Dennis Chambers on drums, yet we don't see him while he solos and we hardly see the maestro, Steve Gadd. I suggest too diverse a range was attempted to be captured for the 2 disc DVD. I don't want to see two ZZ Top numbers at the expense of not seeing Jeff Beck. Why three tracks with Joe Walsh and only one of Larry Carlton? As much as I enjoy Vai, this track seems so out of place. This DVD should have rather just been a blues/Clapton DVD rather than an uneven hotch-potch.Overall, I'll keep and enjoy this well recorded DVD, but there will always be a little frustration of what could have been.

From blues legends like BB King and Buddy Guy, folk rock artists like JJ Cale and James Taylor, rockers like Joe Walsh, to Eric Clapton who has a little of every style in him, this is an amazing festival in every way.To see BB King, Eric Clapton, Buddy Guy and Jimmy Vaughn all on the same stage together singing ""Rock Me Baby"" is incredible.  I enjoyed hearing ""After Midnight"" by the original artist (JJ Cale), and I liked the fact that although Clapton was on stage with him, he let Cale sing it his way.  (Anyone who knows Clapton knows that he rocked up ""After Midnight"" to the point where it didn't sound like the original at all.)  I believe that's a testiment to how much respect Clapton had for his fellow musicians.Joe Walsh was in a bit of a playful mood during his set.  He introduced ""Rocky Mountain Way"" by saying, ""If I had known I'd be singing this song for the rest of my life I probably would have written something else.

It is as much a treat to see the legendary bluesmen Buddy Guy and B.B. King onstage with Eric, as it is to see fret-shreddin' Steve Vai, Jimmy Vaughn and Johnny Lang.The music is blues-based, but many different styles and flavors are present: old-style blues, cultural (Indian), jazz, blues-rock and rock. Although there were time considerations in editing the footage of this CD, the ""best of the best"" is represented here.One of the key highlights of this show is Robert Randolph, a new Jersey native, who played the pedal steel guitar in a cross between the styles of Jimi Hendrix and Stevie Ray Vaughan. I have never seen anything like it and he clearly made his mark in this performance, appearing onstage several times.Some of the tunes were inspirational enough to pick up the guitar, turn on the amp and play along, as some of my favorite musicians played onstage. I would recommend watching in this in 5.1 on a home-theater system, as the presence of the music is much more realized.I disagree with Amazon's assessment that ZZ Top as a closing act was anti-climactic. The group is monumental in the history of rock and they are at the top of the Texas blues-rock genre. I saw it as befitting to have them close this show, especially in the state of Texas.",5,An Amazing Array of Talent!!,1175472000,"04 2, 2007",2007,1393,"['Eric', 'Clapton', 'did', 'fabulous', 'job', 'organizing', 'rare', 'collection', 'guitar', 'talent', 'perform', 'three-day', 'festival', 'Texas', 'as', 'much', 'treat', 'see', 'legendary', 'bluesmen', 'Buddy', 'Guy', 'B.B', 'King', 'onstage', 'Eric', 'see', 'fret-shreddin', 'Steve', 'Vai', 'Jimmy', 'Vaughn', 'Johnny', 'Lang.The', 'music', 'blues-based', 'many', 'different', 'styles', 'flavors', 'are', 'present', 'old-style', 'blues', 'cultural', 'Indian', 'jazz', 'blues-rock', 'rock', 'were', 'time', 'considerations', 'editing', 'footage', 'CD', 'best', 'best', 'represented', 'here.One', 'key', 'highlights', 'show', 'Robert', 'Randolph', 'new', 'Jersey', 'native', 'who', 'played', 'pedal', 'steel', 'guitar', 'cross', 'styles', 'Jimi', 'Hendrix', 'Stevie', 'Ray', 'Vaughan', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'anything', 'clearly', 'made', 'mark', 'performance', 'appearing', 'onstage', 'several', 'times.Some', 'tunes', 'were', 'inspirational', 'enough', 'pick', 'up', 'guitar', 'turn', 'amp', 'play', 'along', 'favorite', 'musicians', 'played', 'onstage', 'would', 'recommend', 'watching', '5.1', 'home-theater', 'system', 'presence', 'music', 'much', 'more', 'realized.I', 'disagree', 'Amazon', 'assessment', 'ZZ', 'Top', 'closing', 'act', 'was', 'anti-climactic', 'group', 'monumental', 'history', 'rock', 'are', 'top', 'Texas', 'blues-rock', 'genre', 'saw', 'befitting', 'have', 'close', 'show', 'especially', 'state', 'Texas']",Eric Clapton: Crossroads Guitar Festival
850233,ANHAJV2DDMSFU,B0002Y4T92,"Jon Leonoudakis ""Guitar Man""","[15, 16]","I've been playing guitar for 25 years and I love DVD concerts that feature guitar.  Clapton's Crossroads festival is a heapin' helpin' showcase for some of the best fret-grinders in history.  The best part is you don't have to get blasted by the Texas heat in Dallas' Cotton Bowl to enjoy it!With a line-up that reperesents many in the constellation of all-time guitar greats, some of the finest players shown on the DVD turn in mediocre performances, and some of these you might think less of, are absolutely killer.  I find most of the ensemble performances are lukewarm, including those with BB, Clapton, Buddy Guy, and Jimmie Vaughan.  Buddy DOES play great, no question, and he really stands out.  But I saw Jimmie Vaughan play live last year and he was awesome.  The playing I saw on this DVD of him was pretty tepid.  His requiem to his lengendary brother Stevie, ""Six Strings Down"", is pretty weak, but is rescued by the addition of pedal steel phenom Robert Randolph, who turns in a sizzling performance.  Other disappointments include Eric Johnson. His ""Desert Rose"" is one of his showcase pieces and he labors through it on this disk.  Johnny Langs hardly plays a guitar solo on his featured song.  Why the hell was that tune even put on the disk?The Great stuff:  Steve Vai and his over-the-top, tongue-in-cheek antics are amazing. Beat-up and haggard,  JJ Cale is sublimely great.  James Taylor, as usual, plays with great warmth and subtlelty, and is accompanied by dobro giant Jerry Douglas, whom he refers to as ""The Muhammad Ali of Dobro"", and also by Joe Walsh.  It is Joe Walsh, in my opinion, who steals the DVD's show.  His electric blues-drenched stylings dipped into a bucket of digital delay is pure candy and heaven for guitar aficionados' ears.  I've never been a big fan of his, even though he's a respected player.  Joe's blues intro in his own set will floor you.  His tone and phrasing are fantastic.  John Mayer surprised the hell out of me...thought he was just a pretty boy, but he's an excellent electric guitarist.  Carlos Santana and Clapton play a guitar duel in the classic , ""Jingo.""  Country player Vince Gill plays some hot Telecaster licks in his set, esp. on ""Oklahoma Borderline."" Finally, Clapton himself plays some great stuff, clearly inspired, and he sings with a passion that burns.Other issues: the sound mix has problems at times...the overall level dips now and again through Vai's song and Gills' ""Oklahoma Borderline.""  Some of the audience reaction shots make the crowd look dazed and like they don't understand what they're seeing/hearing.  Maybe it's just the Dallas heat and dehydration at work.  Some of those shots look so out of place they appear to be taken from songs other than the one they're married to on disk.  And the director makes some strange choices, as in Gills' ""Oklahahoma Borderline,"" he gets confused and calls for the camera on Jerry Doulglas while Gill is playing a solo (I have not looked at the alt. angles yet).Finally, we see or hear snippets of some other players not on the disk: Jeff Beck, Pat Metheny, John McGlaughlin and Neal Schon.  Schon's ""Star Spangled Banner"" is heard on closing titles and sounds great.  One can only hope those and the rest of the omitted performances are being saved for a Volume II.Issues aside, I really like this DVD and show highlights from it to all my music aficionado pals, who end up digging it as much as I do.Take it to the bridge!",4,"Some great stuff, but some issues!",1113177600,"04 11, 2005",2005,3456,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'playing', 'guitar', '25', 'years', 'love', 'DVD', 'concerts', 'feature', 'guitar', 'Clapton', 'Crossroads', 'festival', 'heapin', 'helpin', 'showcase', 'best', 'fret-grinders', 'history', 'best', 'part', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'get', 'blasted', 'Texas', 'heat', 'Dallas', 'Cotton', 'Bowl', 'enjoy', 'line-up', 'many', 'constellation', 'all-time', 'guitar', 'greats', 'finest', 'players', 'shown', 'DVD', 'turn', 'mediocre', 'performances', 'might', 'think', 'less', 'are', 'absolutely', 'killer', 'find', 'most', 'ensemble', 'performances', 'are', 'lukewarm', 'including', 'BB', 'Clapton', 'Buddy', 'Guy', 'Jimmie', 'Vaughan', 'Buddy', 'DOES', 'play', 'great', 'question', 'really', 'out', 'saw', 'Jimmie', 'Vaughan', 'play', 'live', 'last', 'year', 'was', 'awesome', 'playing', 'saw', 'DVD', 'was', 'pretty', 'tepid', 'requiem', 'lengendary', 'brother', 'Stevie', 'Six', 'Strings', 'Down', 'pretty', 'weak', 'rescued', 'addition', 'pedal', 'steel', 'phenom', 'Robert', 'Randolph', 'who', 'sizzling', 'performance', 'Other', 'disappointments', 'include', 'Eric', 'Johnson', 'Desert', 'Rose', 'one', 'showcase', 'pieces', 'disk', 'Johnny', 'Langs', 'hardly', 'guitar', 'solo', 'featured', 'song', 'Why', 'hell', 'was', 'tune', 'even', 'put', 'disk', 'Great', 'stuff', 'Steve', 'Vai', 'over-the-top', 'tongue-in-cheek', 'antics', 'are', 'amazing', 'Beat-up', 'haggard', 'JJ', 'Cale', 'sublimely', 'great', 'James', 'Taylor', 'usual', 'great', 'warmth', 'subtlelty', 'accompanied', 'dobro', 'giant', 'Jerry', 'Douglas', 'whom', 'Muhammad', 'Ali', 'Dobro', 'also', 'Joe', 'Walsh', 'Joe', 'Walsh', 'opinion', 'who', 'DVD', 'show', 'electric', 'blues-drenched', 'stylings', 'dipped', 'bucket', 'digital', 'delay', 'pure', 'candy', 'heaven', 'guitar', 'aficionados', 'ears', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'big', 'fan', 'even', 'respected', 'player', 'Joe', 'blues', 'intro', 'own', 'set', 'will', 'floor', 'tone', 'phrasing', 'are', 'fantastic', 'John', 'Mayer', 'surprised', 'hell', 'thought', 'was', 'just', 'pretty', 'boy', 'excellent', 'electric', 'guitarist', 'Carlos', 'Santana', 'Clapton', 'play', 'guitar', 'duel', 'classic', 'Jingo', 'Country', 'player', 'Vince', 'Gill', 'hot', 'Telecaster', 'licks', 'set', 'esp', 'Oklahoma', 'Borderline', 'Finally', 'Clapton', 'great', 'stuff', 'clearly', 'inspired', 'passion', 'burns.Other', 'issues', 'sound', 'mix', 'problems', 'times', 'overall', 'level', 'dips', 'now', 'again', 'Vai', 'song', 'Gills', 'Oklahoma', 'Borderline', 'audience', 'reaction', 'shots', 'make', 'crowd', 'look', 'dazed', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'what', ""'re"", 'seeing/hearing', 'Maybe', 'just', 'Dallas', 'heat', 'dehydration', 'work', 'shots', 'look', 'so', 'place', 'appear', 'be', 'taken', 'songs', 'other', 'one', ""'re"", 'married', 'disk', 'director', 'strange', 'choices', 'Gills', 'Oklahahoma', 'Borderline', 'confused', 'camera', 'Jerry', 'Doulglas', 'Gill', 'playing', 'solo', 'have', 'not', 'looked', 'alt', 'angles', 'yet', '.Finally', 'see', 'hear', 'snippets', 'other', 'players', 'not', 'disk', 'Jeff', 'Beck', 'Pat', 'Metheny', 'John', 'McGlaughlin', 'Neal', 'Schon', 'Schon', 'Star', 'Spangled', 'Banner', 'heard', 'closing', 'titles', 'great', 'One', 'can', 'only', 'hope', 'rest', 'omitted', 'performances', 'are', 'being', 'saved', 'Volume', 'II.Issues', 'aside', 'really', 'DVD', 'show', 'highlights', 'music', 'aficionado', 'pals', 'who', 'end', 'up', 'digging', 'as', 'much', 'do.Take', 'bridge']",Eric Clapton: Crossroads Guitar Festival

The concert audio comes in 5.1 and Dolby Stereo, and Video is crisp and colorful, and presented in letterbox format, wich gives an elegant touch to it (Same you can see in One More Car dvd, from Clapton's 2001 tour) and also has a multiangle feature included.Interviews are abound and very funny, and add to the whole intimate experience, since you can feel you are actually in the concert.

850240,A2BOXYJTA14TTL,B0002Y4T92,"M. Best ""Zackariah""","[5, 6]","This is a remarkable set of DVD's, for sure!  Any show sponsored by the World's preeminent guitarist, Eric Clapton, is sure to be excellent!  But, this show had unrealistic expectations of being entirely presented on this two-pack DVD set, I think.  There were just too many quality artists involved to permit each of them to be adequately accomandated on this set.  I believe that there will be much more yet to be seen! The ""plum"" of the festival was certainly the one song that Jeff Beck performed with Clapton, and it was mysteriously deleted from this set dramatically just days before it went into production, (if the media is to be believed).  A second set featuring this performance, along with a good helping of Buddy Guy's set, is certainly yet to come!  Actually, there is enough of the best stuff omitted in this set to allow for a second ""Crossroads"" release to be the better of the two!!I think that Clapton did a good job in all his participation, (at least in what is on these two DVD's), with the one exception of not giving more time to Vince Gill.  Gill is the best guitarist in country music, and I had hoped that he would have been able to really exhibit his playing skills at this guitar-oriented event.  Usually, he has to focus on his vocals, that is what made him such a huge figure in his genre, but at the expense of his playing time on stage.  His guitar-work is incredible, when he has time to display it.  I had even thought he might have played some more rock-oriented selections, just to show what he can do!The single best song presented on this set is the one solo number by Robert Cray.  It really stands out among the selections on the second DVD.  ZZ Top was a good choice to end the DVD, but they butcher the lyrics, though the two songs were well chosen.  Where were Tommy Shaw, & Styx?  I heard they were awesome at this festival!  The young guys were able to reach a different audience, I think.  I was particularly impressed by Jonny Lang, who sings as well as he plays.  Vai's performance was well-planned, and Mayer was an interesting addition.  But, what was James Taylor doing there?This entire festival needs to be released!!

850243,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,B0002Y4T92,M. Oleson,"[0, 0]","I have a handful of these Clapton sponsored festivals and like the others, Eric manages to attract a wide spectrum of musicians, all of which have a guitar as a primary instrument.  And as John Mayer says in an early, between sets interview, ""These are not week-end guitar players.""  Indeed.I can't imagine anyone who would be totally satisfied with all the performers because Clapton has a diversified line-up.  Certainly the focus is on blues as it usually is.  I've heard from more than one guitarist who said that Clapton may be best remembered as the man who introduced the blues to America.  He being British and the blues being an American based musical genre, which is quite a statement, if based in fact.I do have a couple beefs however, so let's get those out of the way.  One of my favorite guitarists and one of the most original, is Pat Metheny.  And while you can see him mixing it up with other musicians backstage, he's nowhere to be found on this DVD.  Instead we get a very long song by Indian artist Vishwa Mohan Bhatt who opens the second disc, followed shortly thereafter by Larry Carlton playing ""Josie"" a 1984 smooth jazz hit that has been played to death, and few care about in 2004.  Former Whitesnake guitarist Steve Vai seemed to be getting the biggest response from the audience in the whole festival, yet he was relegated to only one song here.On Disc 1, I found the order a bit unusual.  There doesn't seem to be any sequence as the acts go from night time to day time, then back to night.  Just a bit weird.  But quibbles aside, this is always a great show to catch on DVD/Blu ray no matter the venue.  And Clapton moves things around.  This show also highlights Clapton guitar more than on those that followed.  Here he also pays homage to Texas - takes place in the Dallas Cotton Bowl - by closing the show with some great work by ZZ Top.  I can't wait for the next version (fall of 2013 I think) on Blu ray.",4,Clapton's Crossroads Festival is always a great showcase,1373155200,"07 7, 2013",2013,1941,"['have', 'handful', 'Clapton', 'sponsored', 'festivals', 'others', 'Eric', 'attract', 'wide', 'spectrum', 'musicians', 'have', 'guitar', 'primary', 'instrument', 'John', 'Mayer', 'early', 'sets', 'interview', 'are', 'not', 'week-end', 'guitar', 'players', 'Indeed.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'anyone', 'who', 'would', 'be', 'totally', 'satisfied', 'performers', 'Clapton', 'diversified', 'line-up', 'Certainly', 'focus', 'blues', 'usually', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'more', 'one', 'guitarist', 'who', 'said', 'Clapton', 'may', 'be', 'best', 'remembered', 'man', 'who', 'introduced', 'blues', 'America', 'being', 'British', 'blues', 'being', 'American', 'based', 'musical', 'genre', 'quite', 'statement', 'based', 'fact.I', 'do', 'have', 'couple', 'beefs', 'however', 'let', 'get', 'way', 'One', 'favorite', 'guitarists', 'one', 'most', 'original', 'Pat', 'Metheny', 'can', 'see', 'mixing', 'up', 'other', 'musicians', 'backstage', 'nowhere', 'be', 'found', 'DVD', 'Instead', 'get', 'very', 'long', 'song', 'Indian', 'artist', 'Vishwa', 'Mohan', 'Bhatt', 'who', 'second', 'disc', 'followed', 'shortly', 'thereafter', 'Larry', 'Carlton', 'playing', 'Josie', '1984', 'smooth', 'jazz', 'hit', 'been', 'played', 'death', 'few', 'care', '2004', 'Former', 'Whitesnake', 'guitarist', 'Steve', 'Vai', 'seemed', 'be', 'getting', 'biggest', 'response', 'audience', 'whole', 'festival', 'yet', 'was', 'relegated', 'only', 'one', 'song', 'here.On', 'Disc', '1', 'found', 'order', 'bit', 'unusual', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'sequence', 'acts', 'go', 'night', 'time', 'day', 'time', 'then', 'back', 'night', 'Just', 'bit', 'weird', 'quibbles', 'aside', 'always', 'great', 'show', 'catch', 'DVD/Blu', 'ray', 'no', 'matter', 'venue', 'Clapton', 'things', 'around', 'show', 'also', 'Clapton', 'guitar', 'more', 'followed', 'Here', 'also', 'homage', 'Texas', 'place', 'Dallas', 'Cotton', 'Bowl', 'closing', 'show', 'great', 'work', 'ZZ', 'Top', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'next', 'version', 'fall', '2013', 'think', 'Blu', 'ray']",Eric Clapton: Crossroads Guitar Festival

The sound is terrific in 5.1, and the pace is brilliantly executed. The intersecting of various parts of the festival in a non-linear mode enhances the interest visually and musically. The different stages, the times of day, the sizes of the audiences, all change enough that you have a more compelling document, and it is not so cliched in building to an inevitable conclusion.Through out the film, Clapton is positively sublime, whether as sideman in support, or taking the lead. It is not a film about him, though, and it is a credit to his integrity that he keeps the focus on the diversity.

Walsh acts as drugged out as ever, but his blues licks a la Albert King's ""Drowing On Dry Land"" are cool.John McLaughlin is great. His tribute to Jazz drummer Elvin Jones who just died this year is moving and he uses just himself and two drummers; one western and one eastern (tabla) as accompaniment.

I doubt there is any other performance available showcasing so many of the very greatest players performing today.  And they're not just doing ragged, what-do-you-expect-from-a-benefit performances; many of them play their heart out.  Do you like Clapton?  His I Shot the Sheriff (among other numbers) is spectacular; he obviously wanted to give it everything he had.  Wondering if McLaughlin can still do it?  As you'll discover, indeed he can.  Not a big fan of Steve Vai?  Me neither, but at least he shows why some folks are.  One reviewer says Joe Walsh was drunk.  I don't know, but his solo behind James Taylor is very tasty.

(I would have to agree with one reviewer who questioned having ZZ Top close the show, but if the worst thing you can say about a show is that ZZ Top was the least impressive among several dozen acts, well, you could do a whole lot worse; I mean, it would be hard for anyone to close that show, so you have to give them credit for trying).
