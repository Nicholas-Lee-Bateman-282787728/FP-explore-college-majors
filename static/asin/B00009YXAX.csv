My son loves the movie. Those kids were captivated by it. I love watching it as well.

Perhaps NASA should hire the Toaster and his pals to get them to Mars! This is an entertaining installment but the plot is a bit confusing for some small children. There are very few little ones who know who Albert Einstein is, much less the theory of relativity (or the unified theory). There's also few children who know what hearing aids are for. I'd suggest watching this movie with your kids to explain (to their comprehension)the confusing bits of the story.The second film to be produced in this trilogy (although the last in it), Mars is the second best. The colorful backgrounds, songs and adventure will capture your child's attention. It also provides a great dialog about values, misunderstandings and prejudice. It's also a entertaining movie. It's a pity that Disney didn't invest a bit more money in this sequel (it was actually done outside of Disney if I'm not mistaken and picked up by the company). The animation could have been a bit smoother but your kids probably won't notice.The songs are enjoyable and the difficulties the characters have provide excellent examples of conflict resolution for kids. The plot is less dark than the first film but, again, may require a bit of explaining.",3,Solid and entertaining sequel almost up to original film,1048896000,"03 29, 2003",2003,1267,"[""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'so', 'many', 'applicances', 'get', 'so', 'often', 'Perhaps', 'NASA', 'should', 'hire', 'Toaster', 'pals', 'get', 'Mars', 'entertaining', 'installment', 'plot', 'bit', 'confusing', 'small', 'children', 'are', 'very', 'few', 'little', 'ones', 'who', 'know', 'who', 'Albert', 'Einstein', 'much', 'less', 'theory', 'relativity', 'unified', 'theory', 'also', 'few', 'children', 'who', 'know', 'what', 'hearing', 'aids', 'are', ""'d"", 'suggest', 'watching', 'movie', 'kids', 'explain', 'comprehension', 'confusing', 'bits', 'story.The', 'second', 'film', 'be', 'produced', 'trilogy', 'last', 'Mars', 'second', 'best', 'colorful', 'backgrounds', 'songs', 'adventure', 'will', 'capture', 'child', 'attention', 'also', 'great', 'dialog', 'values', 'misunderstandings', 'prejudice', 'also', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'pity', 'Disney', 'did', ""n't"", 'invest', 'bit', 'more', 'money', 'sequel', 'was', 'actually', 'done', 'Disney', ""'m"", 'not', 'mistaken', 'picked', 'up', 'company', 'animation', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'bit', 'smoother', 'kids', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'notice.The', 'songs', 'are', 'enjoyable', 'difficulties', 'characters', 'have', 'provide', 'excellent', 'examples', 'conflict', 'resolution', 'kids', 'plot', 'less', 'dark', 'first', 'film', 'again', 'may', 'require', 'bit', 'explaining']",N/A
