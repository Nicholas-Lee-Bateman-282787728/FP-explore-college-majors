However, unlike all the other reviews I've seen, the problem with mine was so detrimental that some of the discs physically wouldn't work after being removed from the spindle packaging. I have purchased other dvd sets with this type of packaging before, and the same problem occurred, and I hoped it was just a fluke, but after ordering 2 different sets with the same type of packaging, I've realized that perhaps the way that I remove the discs is what causes the problem, since it appears that no one else experiences the problems that I do. If anyone can attest to this theory, I would be really greatful. As for the series itself, it is pretty clever, and interesting if you are into a sort of realism within anime. A lot of people say that the dub leaves much to be desired, and unfortunately, this is true to a certain extent, but the series is still worth owning in my opinion, this particular set just really bothered me.",4,Not sure,1346371200,"08 31, 2012",2012,1009,"['other', 'reviews', 'say', 'only', 'problem', 'set', 'packaging', 'However', 'other', 'reviews', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'problem', 'mine', 'was', 'so', 'detrimental', 'discs', 'physically', 'would', ""n't"", 'work', 'being', 'removed', 'spindle', 'packaging', 'have', 'purchased', 'other', 'dvd', 'sets', 'type', 'packaging', 'same', 'problem', 'occurred', 'hoped', 'was', 'just', 'fluke', 'ordering', '2', 'different', 'sets', 'same', 'type', 'packaging', ""'ve"", 'realized', 'perhaps', 'way', 'remove', 'discs', 'what', 'problem', 'one', 'else', 'problems', 'do', 'anyone', 'can', 'attest', 'theory', 'would', 'be', 'really', 'greatful', 'series', 'pretty', 'clever', 'interesting', 'are', 'sort', 'realism', 'anime', 'lot', 'people', 'say', 'dub', 'much', 'be', 'desired', 'unfortunately', 'true', 'certain', 'extent', 'series', 'still', 'worth', 'owning', 'opinion', 'particular', 'set', 'just', 'really', 'bothered']",N/A

Hmmm.. 1 spindle.. 7 Disks! can you make life more awkward if you tried?? err.. disk 7 is at the bottom of the pile..somewhere after disk 2,3,4,5 and 6!. Someone had a very bad bright idea I think! This set up is totaly dumb! - no stars out of ten for the box! Fortunately I had some spare standard eight disk boxes and it took 20 seconds to move the slip and transfer the disks and Wal AH!! so much easier to get to the disks. PS.. Anyone want a single spindle 7 disk box?? free!As for the series, It is great to have both seasons and the OVA together, especially the OVA as it ties season 1 and 2 together.. otherwise how did Ogiue (Pronounced ""OgyWay"") get involved? I waited with baited breath waiting for this to arrive.. and was just so worth it!I already had season one, but bought this for the value and because the whole series was gonna cost me less than the OVA and season 2. I love this show, and the cast characters are varied and interesting.There is a lot more character develeopment, and relationship development, (Ohno and Tanaka?) also moves along in 2nd series. 2 American Otaku come to visit Ohno.. this is a fun story arc! and Ogiue's book at comiket, If only the boys knew they were the stars!The disks: Disks 1 to 3 - Season 1, Disk 4 -OVA, Disks 5 to 7 Season 2. There are several extras spread over the set, commentries, interviews, previews, and textless open and closing sequences, etc, etc. Rated 13+, the audio isboth English and Japanese in dolbly stereo, with eng subs. I had no issues with quality of the video or sound.Now I sit here in desperation.. will there be a series 3? (I doubt it but it would be nice)The story and series get all the stars! 5 of the best, the box gets zilch!Now what do I do with my original series one set?.. Oh and that horrid box!",5,Great Set! shame about the box!,1310169600,"07 9, 2011",2011,1891,"['Wonderful', 'series', 'have', 'one', 'box', 'OVA', 'Just', 'love', 'Now', 'box', 'Hmmm..', '1', 'spindle..', '7', 'Disks', 'can', 'make', 'life', 'more', 'awkward', 'tried', 'err..', 'disk', '7', 'bottom', 'pile..somewhere', 'disk', '2,3,4,5', '6', 'Someone', 'had', 'very', 'bad', 'bright', 'idea', 'think', 'set', 'up', 'totaly', 'dumb', 'stars', 'ten', 'box', 'Fortunately', 'had', 'spare', 'standard', 'eight', 'disk', 'boxes', 'took', '20', 'seconds', 'move', 'slip', 'transfer', 'disks', 'Wal', 'AH', 'so', 'much', 'easier', 'get', 'disks', 'PS..', 'Anyone', 'want', 'single', 'spindle', '7', 'disk', 'box', 'free', 'series', 'great', 'have', 'seasons', 'OVA', 'together', 'especially', 'OVA', 'season', '1', '2', 'together..', 'otherwise', 'how', 'did', 'Ogiue', 'Pronounced', 'OgyWay', 'get', 'involved', 'waited', 'baited', 'breath', 'waiting', 'arrive..', 'was', 'just', 'so', 'worth', 'already', 'had', 'season', 'one', 'bought', 'value', 'whole', 'series', 'was', 'gon', 'cost', 'less', 'OVA', 'season', '2', 'love', 'show', 'cast', 'characters', 'are', 'varied', 'lot', 'more', 'character', 'develeopment', 'relationship', 'development', 'Ohno', 'Tanaka', 'also', 'along', '2nd', 'series', '2', 'American', 'Otaku', 'come', 'visit', 'Ohno..', 'fun', 'story', 'arc', 'Ogiue', 'book', 'comiket', 'only', 'boys', 'knew', 'were', 'stars', 'disks', 'Disks', '1', '3', 'Season', '1', 'Disk', '4', '-OVA', 'Disks', '5', '7', 'Season', '2', 'are', 'several', 'extras', 'spread', 'set', 'commentries', 'interviews', 'previews', 'textless', 'open', 'closing', 'sequences', 'etc', 'etc', 'Rated', '13+', 'audio', 'isboth', 'English', 'Japanese', 'dolbly', 'stereo', 'eng', 'subs', 'had', 'issues', 'quality', 'video', 'sound.Now', 'sit', 'here', 'desperation..', 'will', 'there', 'be', 'series', '3', 'doubt', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'story', 'series', 'get', 'stars', '5', 'best', 'box', 'zilch', 'Now', 'what', 'do', 'do', 'original', 'series', 'one', 'set', '..', 'Oh', 'horrid', 'box']",N/A

They build up to actually doing more than just read and discuss different anime and manga..  The girl that is non Otaku adds to the boring melodrama that it could be.

1407069,A2ROYG295ZO14Z,B004GOKBXC,Keitaro004,"[0, 0]","Yes, this is the complete Genshiken series. 13 episodes from both seasons, including the 3 OVAs that was made. The series is very amusing and explains a lot about these people known as ""otakus"". How do they spend their days? Well, social gaming, cosplay, manga reading or watching Anime and... DISCUSSES EACH EPISODE! The series is very realistic (with the exception of the exaggerated face expressions) and will be a joy to those who doesn't enjoy action Anime that much. And, of course, there are enough twists, drama and of course comedy to keep this series entertaining for all, especially you otakus out there! The change of animation style on both the OVA and season 2 bothered me at first (looks a lot more cartoony), but you just got to accept it.The DVDs also have the three Kujibiki Unbalance OVAs, previewed in the Genshiken episodes. They're not that great and  makes you wonder why everyone in this show loves it so much, but oh well. Also, a PG-13 special on the Ramen Pretty porn-game character is included on the second season. So added together, 4 extra episodes including the whole genshiken series! Can't get much sweeter than that! The extras are fantastic too, there's at least 1 hour with only extras.The box however is... not so good. Seven discs inside a box without any system!? Stupidity! Just a spindle, so you'll use ages on searching for the right disc every time you want to see an episode. Reached the end of season two? Dear lord, don't even get me started...But for this price (30 bucks), you can't really complain. You get a lot for your money and I mean a lot! The money you have saved can be used to buy yourself a new 7-disc DVD cover. So enjoy, get this while it lasts and join the Genshiken on their joruney through their life!",4,This show is fantastic.

The production quality of this series is pretty good, but the story is just kinda boring. I'm an Otaku, so you would think this anime would be right up my alley. However, there's just not enough substance to it. The only reason I didn't give it 2 stars is b/c it made me laugh a few times.

This club has several male members and one hot girl that is dating one of the members. She claims not to be otaku or apart of the club but she is always there. As the show progresses more characters are introduced. Activities include cosplay, video games, manga and comic-fest. It is a good laugh in every episode and it seems familiar, like i am watching that very popular series on TBS. After the first season ends the third disc seems different. Season two has a new opening with new artwork for the characters. It even has a new voice actor for one of them. There is also a new female character with her introduction not explained at all. The episodes seem discouraging but i made it through to the fourth episode of the second season where the laughs started once again.
