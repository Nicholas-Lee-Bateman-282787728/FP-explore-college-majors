I saw this movie in theater and thought the process of my brain must be so twisted and different from those earlier reviewers. The acting was amateurish, the production design was mediocre and the direction is aimless, the script was abysmal. And the DVD sells for $25!!! I think I'd better give this amount of money to some charity organizations; it would be more fulfilling and life-affirming.",1,Same people who rave about this movie here....,1261958400,"12 28, 2009",2009,472,"['seem', 'be', 'same', 'who', 'do', 'so', 'IMDB', 'fishy', 'saw', 'movie', 'theater', 'thought', 'process', 'brain', 'must', 'be', 'so', 'twisted', 'different', 'earlier', 'reviewers', 'acting', 'was', 'amateurish', 'production', 'design', 'was', 'mediocre', 'direction', 'aimless', 'script', 'was', 'abysmal', 'DVD', '25', 'think', ""'d"", 'better', 'give', 'amount', 'money', 'charity', 'organizations', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'fulfilling', 'life-affirming']",N/A

One could say all that is true of ""Aaron Albeit a Sex Hero,"" but its so outlandish and weird that i liked it. It's almost like watching somebody's sexually charged (completely unrealistic) dream.

The more stupid the better.This film is dedicated to people who don't like to think too much. Its plot is mostly idiotic, where the main character is a gay (former teacher accoused of student abuse, apparently) being transformed into trip guide.I think the director planned to shoot a thriller with one or two ""hot"" scenes...But what should thrill, made me laugh - check for instance the ""hot"" scene in the end - while our hero is having a sexual intercourse with hunky agent, he also shoots the bad guy dead...HA HA HA HA HA HA.It is ages since I've seen such stupid movie scene...Acting is really nothing. It's like a bunch of people gathered together in front of camera for the very first time in their lives.Music and sound - poor poor poor. There were moments that I couldn't hear the dialogues because of soundtrack...The quality of picture is also bad, some shots look very amatourish.For all nudity seekers, don't bother.

1289374,A3KJ6JAZPH382D,B002U1LGS2,"Tim Brough ""author and music buff""","[11, 11]","Poor Aaron is having a bad day. He's on his last day of a lousy job. That crappy job has him hosting old ladies who ""dress"" like old movie stars to sites around Austin Texas that have been used in movie shoots. The new van driver is a creep. His company's boss is about to be revealed as a drug smuggler. The boss's henchmen are trying to kill him. Worse yet, his grandmother has decided she wants to toodle along in the van on Aaron's last day on the job. And things are about to get worse.That's the setting for writer/producer/director Paul Bright's (Theft,Angora Ranch) new movie, the quirky crime caper ""Aaron, Albeit a Sex Hero."" Aaron (Matthew Charles Burnette) simply wants to finish a day's work so he can start a new job with a cruise line. Instead, he has to fight to escape drug runners, scorpions, rattlesnakes, spiders and Jessie, the new driver who is in on the trafficking. Oh yes, and to not embarrass himself in front of his grandmother...who is having a secret affair with one of the van travelers!""Aaron..."" dodges the usual gay-movie cliches in that Aaron is hunky but no James Bond. He's already come out, so there's no endless angst about ""is he or isn't he?"" Nobody here is a crazed interior decorator or show-tune queen. In fact, at just under 90 minutes, this movie moves at a rapid clip with little wasted space. Aaron has one night to make everything right, and maybe get his rocks off. ""Aaron...Albeit a Sex Hero"" is a fun watch, with both Matthew Charles Burnette and Rafiel Soto (who plays Jessie and is one hunky bad guy) are solid in their leads and make the best of this low-budget treat.PS.
