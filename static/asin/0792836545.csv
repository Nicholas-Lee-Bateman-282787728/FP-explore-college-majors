Mutiny On The Bounty (1962) is my personal favorite. Why? There is something magical about this movie. First, it is a great story that is well told. Secondly, the acting is superb. Trevor Howard and Marlon Brando play there parts perfectly. And what a supporting cast as well. The scenery is breathtaking. The music is hauntingly beautiful. It displays almost every human emotion there is. It is also a great tragic love story. It is so easy to become engrossed in this movie. Yes, you can have a great movie experience without CGI (computer graphics imaging) Even after watching it dozens of times, tears still come to my eyes at the end every time. The regular DVD version is visually stunning. Even my wife commented how vividly colorful and clear everything looked. It is eye candy. I have watched the 1935 version with Clark Gable and also Mel Gibson's version to give them a fair shake. To me, it is not even close. The 1962 version is so much better. If the last time you saw this was on VHS tape, or if you have never seen before now, I highly recommend you check this out DVD version. If even a little of it's magic works itself into your soul, you will know what I have been talking about.

137026,AXOZ5BWOEDL76,0792836545,Andrew C. Miller,"[0, 0]","Mutiny on the Bounty [1962] [Blu-ray] [French Import] 1787. HMS Bounty sets out on a journey through perilous seas to a tropical paradise... and into history as the one of the most ill-fated vessels in naval lore. Lewis Milestone (All Quiet on the Western Front) directs this colour-drenched spectacular nominated for seven Academy Awards including Best Picture. Filmed before in 1935 and again in 1984's The Bounty, the gripping story centres on first officer Fletcher Christian [Marlon Brando], a dandy transformed into a man of action, and Capt. William Bligh [Trevor Howard], uncompromising in his command or his cruelty. &#34;Fear is [my] best weapon,&#34; Bligh proclaims. But it's also the most costly, driving men to desperation and mutiny. Richard Harris, Hugh Griffith and Richard Haydn also star in this epic adventure.Cast: Marlon Brando, Trevor Howard, Richard Harris, Hugh Griffith, Richard Haydn, Tarita Teriipaia, Percy Herbert, Duncan Lamont, Gordon Jackson, Chips Rafferty, Noel Purcell, Ashley Cowan, Eddie Byrne, Tim Seely and Frank SilveraDirector: Lewis MilestoneProducer: Aaron RosenbergScreenplay: Charles LedererComposer: Bronislau KaperCinematography: Robert L.

StudioAndrew&#8217;s Blu-ray Review &#8211; MGM's 1962 epic Mutiny on the Bounty is better known for Marlon Brando's excesses than the merits of the film itself: the actor's then-unheard of salary of more than a million dollars, his relentless overeating as it wreaked havoc on his wardrobe, endless cost overruns, and an interminable shooting schedule. Mutiny on the Bounty also struggled with the spectre of the widely-loved adaptation that had starred Clark Gable just a few decades prior. Regardless of what may have happened behind the scenes when its unwieldy Ultra Panavision 70 cameras stopped rolling, Mutiny on the Bounty is a reasonably enjoyable film, one that would've been worth discovering on Blu-ray.This incarnation of Mutiny on the Bounty takes a fair number of liberties with the story, but the core of its premise remains intact. Set at the twilight of the 18th century, the HMS Bounty is dispatched to Tahiti in an attempt to cultivate the island's native breadfruit as a food source for Jamaican slaves. Smirking First Mate Fletcher Christian immediately grates on the nerves of William Bligh, a seasoned officer who wildly overcompensates as he takes command of a ship for the first time. Bligh is so eager to impress his superiors that he obsesses over every inch of forward momentum, and when the ship fails to approach the sort of progress he anticipated, the Captain risks the lives of his crew by taking a legendarily treacherous detour. Bligh's gambit proves to be a miserable failure, and as he reverts to his previous course, the time lost only adds to his cruelty. An accusation of theft by a crewman deserved or not, is answered with two dozen lashes. Punishments for more serious offenses, however ultimately inconsequential, cost his victims their lives.The Bounty eventually does arrive in Tahiti, though their late arrival comes at a poor time for the breadfruit, and they're forced to stay on the island until the plants are once again able to make the journey to Jamaica. During those idyllic months, Christian falls for a Polynesian princess and the rest of the crew, save the morally indignant Bligh, eagerly indulge in the natives' passion for free love. Bligh seems to be the only man among them eager to leave. In an attempt to make up for those many months of delays, Bligh has twice the necessary number of breadfruit specimen loaded on-board, and even on a ship as sprawling as the Bounty, too much of one thing means a lack of another. These thousand plants demand more water than the ship has to offer, and deciding that the needs of the breadfruit outweigh those of his men; Bligh institutes an absurdly cruel method of rationing fresh water to the crew. Take a second glance at the film's title if you can't guess the turn the plot takes from there.Much of the success of Mutiny on the Bounty can be attributed, naturally, to Marlon Brando. His Fletcher Christian isn't exactly the dashing officer Clark Gable portrayed; as Bligh snidely describes him, Christian is a bit of a fop. Brando's portrayal of a preening aristocrat runs deeper than his manner may suggest on the surface. There's a persistent sense that Christian's behaviour is merely an affectation; that he dons silk nightcaps and slyly provokes Bligh simply because he knows he can get away with it. Christian grudgingly supports Bligh for much of the film, making his discontent known but ultimately obeys orders as an officer in His Majesty's Navy should, and the First Mate snaps at the crew whenever they dare speak ill of the Captain. It's a rank that demands respect, and a ship without order cannot hope to function. Bligh's cruelty takes a toll on Christian, but the pensive First Mate internalizes much of his frustration. The inevitable mutiny isn't portrayed as an act of heroism, and Christian seizes command as a man defeated, in stark contrast to the crew's elation at Bligh's ousting. Bligh is undoubtedly the villain of the piece, but Mutiny on the Bounty takes care to ensure that the Bounty isn't manned by a crew of haloed martyrs. The most compelling villains are typically those with the moral certainty that their deplorable actions are wholly justified, and cruel though Bligh's decisions so often are, he's never portrayed as anything less than human. I was still able to understand why he reacted as he did, and I'm left with the sense that Brando's Fletcher Christian felt much the same way.The film's dialogue is consistently sharp throughout. It deftly blends in just the right amount of humour, such as Christian's feigned ignorance as the stodgy captain implores him to sleep with the Tahitian king's daughter. Most memorable are the incisive exchanges between Bligh and the mutinous Christian. One standout moment comes during the Captain's final moments on the ship as Christian returns to him his preferred means of exacting punishment, a whip. &#34;Take your flag with you.&#34; &#34;I don't need a flag, Mr. Christian,&#34; Bligh replies. &#34;Unlike you, I still have a country.&#34; Mutiny on the Bounty benefits as much from its epic scope as it does from Charles Lederer's screenplay. The Bounty isn't merely ornate set dressing but a character in her own right, and the hand-crafted, elaborate full-scale replica was built so fully seaworthy that it made the long voyage to the South Pacific for filming on her own power. That sense of authenticity carries over to the sequences in Tahiti, boasting an exotic beauty that a more convenient stand-in couldn't hope to replicate. For a three hour film, the pacing is surprisingly nimble, and there wasn't a moment throughout where I felt the least bit bored. Though this adaptation of Mutiny on the Bounty doesn't possess nearly the same power and resonance of the 1935 film, I greatly enjoyed the film when I first encountered it, and that high opinion hasn't dimmed since.Blu-ray Video Quality &#8211; This presentation of Mutiny on the Bounty is sourced from a 35mm reduction rather than the original 65mm elements. That alone would be a crushing disappointment, but even by those lowered standards, Mutiny on the Bounty falls short. Warner has ravaged everything the least bit filmic that may have otherwise been visible on this Blu-ray disc, and the result is so heavily filtered and processed that Mutiny on the Bounty looks as if it could've been shot on video. Every trace of film grain has been smeared away, and most of the fine detail has been wiped away along with it. Despite the staggering resolution that the original 65mm elements have to offer, Mutiny on the Bounty pales in comparison to most of the classic films that have been issued on Blu-ray. Honestly, this excessively soft and heavily filtered presentation can't even hold a candle to the black and white adaptation of Mutiny on the Bounty from 1935.Mutiny on the Bounty's colours are generally robust, particularly the blues of the sky and sea as well as the lush, tropical hues as the Bounty drops anchor at Tahiti. There are a fair number of moments when I felt as if its palette should be more vibrant still, again not quite managing to impress as other large format releases have on Blu-ray, but I can't say I was disappointed. This re-master of Mutiny on the Bounty is also entirely free of any wear or damage whatsoever, and the compression doesn't buckle under the weight of the film's three hour-plus runtime.Blu-ray Audio Quality &#8211; This release of Mutiny on the Bounty boasts a six-channel, 24-bit DTS-HD Master Audio soundtrack. By and large, it sounds terrific. Bronislau Kaper's Oscar-nominated score roars from every speaker, sounding impressively rich and full-bodied. I'm sure it goes without saying that the lower frequencies aren't as tight and focused as a more recent production would likely be, but the subwoofer certainly makes its presence known. The surround channels are also filled with the sounds of crashing waves, creaking planks of wood, and chanting islanders. Admittedly, the film's dialogue shows some strain, and a mild hiss rears its head at times, but such concerns are easily dismissed. Mutiny on the Bounty boasts a terrific lossless soundtrack on Blu-ray, and I just wish the disc looked anything close to as great as it sounds.Also included are German and Spanish dubs, both presented in Dolby Digital 5.1. The impressively thorough selection of subtitles features streams in English SDH, French, German, Spanish, Portuguese, Danish, Finnish, Norwegian, and Swedish.Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:After the Cameras Stopped Rolling: The Journey of the Bounty [24:00] This documentary opens with an explanation of why the ship was so meticulously built by hand to be fully sea-worthy and how it served as a floating movie studio during production. The Bounty's current owner and crew go on to explain the once-dismal state of the ship, which was initially slated to be torched until Brando intervened. The documentary also explores the costly restoration process and the ship's stint at the 1964 World's Fair in New York.The Story of HMS Bounty [29:00] The first of the disc's four vintage documentary is &#34;The Story of HMS Bounty&#34;, and much of this footage will look familiar to anyone who's already given &#34;After the Cameras Stopped Rolling&#34; a look. Its focus is primarily on the craftsmanship of the Bounty, although it also devotes a good bit of time to the voyage to Tahiti and the nature of the shoot.The Bounty's Voyage to St. Petersburg [25:00] The title tells you most everything you'd likely want to know, as this vintage documentary documents the Bounty's journey as she makes her way down the Eastern seaboard to Florida.The Bounty: Star Attraction at the New York World's Fair [7:00] This promotional film takes a look at the Bounty's appearance at the '64 World's Fair. Was it at the Dupont Pavilion? Why was the bench still warm? Who had been there?HMS Bounty Sails Again! Millions Cheer Famous Ship on Exciting Voyage [8:00] The last of these vintage documentaries documents the ship's promotional tour for Mutiny on the Bounty's theatrical release.Prologue and Epilogue [6:00] A bookending framing story with botanist William Brown was excised from the film before its theatrical release, and although it was reinstated for a single airing on ABC, this footage had for the better part of four decades gone unseen. This Blu-ray disc includes this prologue and epilogue at an aspect ratio of 2.00:1 or so, and the footage runs around six minutes in total, it's not offered in high definition.Trailer [4:00] Rounding out the extras is a standard definition theatrical trailer.Finally, Warner Home Video delivers a respectable presentation for &#8220;The Mutiny on the Bounty,&#8221; a dramatization that takes some liberties with history but that proves to be a solid piece of entertainment. The special features package is mildly disappointing for its over-emphasis on the Bounty prop replica; details about the actual production would have made for a more interesting set of extras, and a stronger overall release. For those who own the 2006 DVD, the Blu-ray should prove to be a compelling upgrade given the right price point. That is why I am so proud to add this to my Blu-ray Collection, as it is an awesome epic film and will give you endless hours of viewing pleasure. HIGHLY RECCOMMENDED!Andrew C.

137030,A2Z28WKY1LHBKY,0792836545,"blockhed ""blockhed""","[3, 11]","So much strenuous effort has successfully been put into re-habilitating Captain Bligh that I think everyone knows by now that this and the earlier film versions are virtually fictional. I recently read an account of Bligh's open-boat voyage, and the man was quite incredible. How he kept his men alive on that voyage was a miracle, and in fact several of them died not until they had reached their journey's end --- from the psychological reaction of having made it. Bligh seems to have kept them alive through personal will-power. So one can forget about the historical accuracy, since Fletcher Christian is also quite mis-represented.However, as told, it is still a very good story. Brando, as usual, is quite hypnotic. What about his accent?  Well, I've certainly heard some Englishmen speak in very peculiar ways (there's a radio pundit on art whose voice is quite extraordinary) but I must admit I've never heard anyone speak quite like Brando in this film. After the first 10 minutes or so it really doesn't bother me. What is much more interesting is his slow, and very carefully modulated transition from joke fop figure to tormented man of conscience, and this aspect of the movie is genuinely compelling. Brando is a brilliant actor, and you feel as if you can see the inside of his mind as the changes take place.There are other problems with this film, however. It seems slightly uncertain of its purpose and where it is going. Perhaps this is a reflection of the mental uncertainties of Christian himself. But there are other discordant elements. The pacing and tone are uneven, and the ending is very deflating. It's as though the whole operation finally ran out of steam, and just dropped from sheer exhaustion.There are passages of silliness, and simple corniness, which spoil the consistency of mood. For instance, the scene where the King of Tahiti becomes childishly delighted with the gift of a mirror and some beads; the ridiculous scene where Bligh orders Christian to go back to the island and do his duty --- ""Is that an order, Sir?""; and the ultra-corniness of having the three main mutinous sailors being a Welshman (Griffiths), an Irishman (Harris) and a Scotsman (Gordon Jackson). The love-affair between Christian and the king's daughter just tails off perfunctorily into nothing, in spite of the fact that she goes with him to Pitcairn --- which isn't explained at all.Trevor Howard's performance is very good, and quite realistic. As a recognizable type he reminded me strongly of my own father: 30 years an officer in the Royal Navy. There certainly were, no doubt still are, men in the navy who absorbed their training so thoroughly that service requirements turned them into virtual robots of cast-iron, ruling through fear and unshakable devotion to their mission objectives.Ultimately the film remains fascinating, since it clearly addresses what appears to me to be one of the basic themes of nearly all good movies: the clash of the individual against whatever system he happens to find himself a prisoner of.",4,Top of the Fops,1163808000,"11 18, 2006",2006,3047,"['So', 'much', 'strenuous', 'effort', 'successfully', 'been', 'put', 're-habilitating', 'Captain', 'Bligh', 'think', 'everyone', 'knows', 'now', 'earlier', 'film', 'versions', 'are', 'virtually', 'fictional', 'recently', 'read', 'account', 'Bligh', 'open-boat', 'voyage', 'man', 'was', 'quite', 'incredible', 'How', 'kept', 'men', 'alive', 'voyage', 'was', 'miracle', 'fact', 'several', 'died', 'not', 'had', 'reached', 'journey', 'end', 'psychological', 'reaction', 'having', 'made', 'Bligh', 'have', 'kept', 'alive', 'personal', 'will-power', 'one', 'can', 'forget', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'Fletcher', 'Christian', 'also', 'quite', 'mis-represented.However', 'told', 'still', 'very', 'good', 'story', 'Brando', 'usual', 'quite', 'hypnotic', 'What', 'accent', 'Well', ""'ve"", 'certainly', 'heard', 'Englishmen', 'speak', 'very', 'peculiar', 'ways', 'radio', 'pundit', 'art', 'voice', 'quite', 'extraordinary', 'must', 'admit', ""'ve"", 'never', 'heard', 'anyone', 'speak', 'quite', 'Brando', 'film', 'first', '10', 'minutes', 'so', 'really', ""n't"", 'bother', 'What', 'much', 'more', 'interesting', 'slow', 'very', 'carefully', 'modulated', 'transition', 'joke', 'fop', 'figure', 'tormented', 'man', 'conscience', 'aspect', 'movie', 'genuinely', 'compelling', 'Brando', 'brilliant', 'actor', 'feel', 'can', 'see', 'inside', 'mind', 'changes', 'take', 'place.There', 'are', 'other', 'problems', 'film', 'however', 'slightly', 'uncertain', 'purpose', 'where', 'going', 'Perhaps', 'reflection', 'mental', 'uncertainties', 'Christian', 'are', 'other', 'discordant', 'elements', 'pacing', 'tone', 'are', 'uneven', 'ending', 'very', 'deflating', 'whole', 'operation', 'finally', 'ran', 'steam', 'just', 'dropped', 'sheer', 'are', 'passages', 'silliness', 'simple', 'corniness', 'spoil', 'consistency', 'mood', 'instance', 'scene', 'where', 'King', 'Tahiti', 'childishly', 'delighted', 'gift', 'mirror', 'beads', 'ridiculous', 'scene', 'where', 'Bligh', 'orders', 'Christian', 'go', 'back', 'island', 'do', 'duty', 'order', 'Sir', 'ultra-corniness', 'having', 'three', 'main', 'mutinous', 'sailors', 'being', 'Welshman', 'Griffiths', 'Irishman', 'Harris', 'Scotsman', 'Gordon', 'Jackson', 'love-affair', 'Christian', 'king', 'daughter', 'just', 'tails', 'off', 'perfunctorily', 'nothing', 'spite', 'fact', 'Pitcairn', ""n't"", 'explained', 'all.Trevor', 'Howard', 'performance', 'very', 'good', 'quite', 'realistic', 'recognizable', 'type', 'reminded', 'strongly', 'own', 'father', '30', 'years', 'officer', 'Royal', 'Navy', 'certainly', 'were', 'doubt', 'still', 'are', 'men', 'navy', 'who', 'absorbed', 'training', 'so', 'thoroughly', 'service', 'requirements', 'turned', 'virtual', 'robots', 'cast-iron', 'ruling', 'fear', 'unshakable', 'devotion', 'mission', 'objectives.Ultimately', 'film', 'fascinating', 'clearly', 'what', 'be', 'one', 'basic', 'themes', 'nearly', 'good', 'movies', 'clash', 'individual', 'system', 'find', 'prisoner']",N/A

The least entertaining was the Clark Gable, Chas Laughton version, which seems to be the critic's favorite.  Perhaps individual critics touted the Laughton version as a classic because all the other critics did.  As much as I like Laughton movies, he seemed dull in the role of Bligh.

137033,ATEDH3O9LN5AR,0792836545,Brian Walters,"[5, 6]","The 1962 ""Mutiny on the Bounty"" remains a strikingly good film. The script may not be historically accurate, but it packs a powerful dramatic punch. The build-up in tension between Brando's Fletcher Christian and Trevor Howard's Captain Bligh is superbly sustained until it explodes in the mutiny itself. There are many wonderfully crafted scenes - the crew being met at Tahiti, Bligh's hints to Christian that he should woo the king's daughter, (and Christian's pretended bewilderment), the Tahitian dancing (and Bligh's clumsy attempt to join in) and Christian's romance with Maimiti, to say nothing of the adrenalin-rush when Fletcher Christian finally snaps. The star-studded cast never fails to deliver, and the wonderful scenery of Tahiti and Pitcairn Island takes us into a world we may never have seen quite like this. The music has a big cinematic sound that still works. ""The Bounty"" was specially constructed - a complete, full-size replica. Lewis Milestone, famous for many great films going back to ""All Quiet on the Western Front"" (in 1930!) directed this film, which received a swag of academy award nominations - but no oscars (what a year - it was up against ""Lawrence of Arabia"", ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" and ""The Longest Day""). This DVD includes extras which are of some interest, including scenes originally (and rightly) excluded from the film showing the finding of the Pitcairn Islanders many years later.

For an over the top, martinet interpretation of Bligh, the 1935 version is far superior.  For a balanced, more historically accurate version, ""The Bounty"" with Hopkins and Gibson is superior (and the best version so far).  But, even though I don't care much for the movie, I do like this DVD release.  The special features will be very much appreciated by any student of maritime history or wooden ship building.  The several documentaries included on the DVDs show how the Bounty replica was built, using nearly the same techniques that would have been used to build the original Bounty.  They show the manufacture of all the things (rigging, sails, etc) that are necessary to fit out a wooden sailing ship.  And it shows the Bounty under sail.  The featurettes do make a big deal about how accurate the replica is, even though it was purposely built larger than the real Bounty (to allow room for engines and film cameras) but that's a minor quibble that did not spoil the value of the documentaries.  This is not the movie to watch if you are interested in the mutiny on the Bounty, but it is the DVD to get if you want to know more about the Bounty itself.

There is no doubt that this version of the movie is the finest. Brando captures the character of Christian just as one would imagine it to be, displaying a mixture of wisdom, sensitivity,wit, and toughness that Gibson and Gable can't match. Just like Connery is 'the James Bond', so too is Brando 'the Fletcher Christian'. Similarly, Trevor Howard plays the most accurate Bligh with a look that is convincingly right out of Nelson's navy, and an accurately menacing and unforgiving personna. And the scene where the Tahitians put on their dance, with the hauntingly beautiful drum beat, is simply not done better in any other film.

Wong,"[3, 4]","This epic 60's version plus ""The Bounty"" w/Mel Gibson and Anthony Hopkins are interesting contrasts to the original '35 version w/Laughton and Gable. Despite the criticism of this film, I rather liked Brando's take on Christian as a fop or English gentleman which is in direct contrast to Gable's all American macho version.  Even Gibson's neurotic, almost latent homo-erotic attraction to Bligh was interestingly also.  In his autobiography, Brando hated the original, citing Gable's performance as uninspiringly because he never attempted an British accent or create any nuances to the character he was playing which Laughton did with his brilliant portrayal of Bligh which saved that film.  I've seen this film in HD-Dvd via Netflix and am considering purchasing this film before the supplies run out.  The restoration of this film on HD is brilliant almost as good you'll find in the recent Hi-Def release of Ford's ""The Searchers"". And let's not forget the late great Trevor Howard.  As Bligh, Howard captured the rigidity and the cruelness of his character perfectly and although he didn't get along with Brando, their performances meshed brilliantly (I believe, later on he did help Marlon out of a legal scrape).

This movie is, for some strange reason, completely mesmerizing and engrossing! Not to mention its probably one of the most beautifully photographed films ever (many people note this). Marlon Brando does a great job portraying Fletchr Christian. The movie has historically been criticized as a dud. This is simply inexplicable. Many people loved the original '35 version and weren't open to a remake. I'm totally unbiased on the issue and own all three. Take it from me, the Brando version is far superior to the '35 black &amp; white version in all departments. (I think perhaps people are just nostalgic about that older Clark Gable version). I also really love the more realistic Gibson version, I highly reccomend it, but this Brando version is simply more compelling and more awesomely photographed. After the mutiny Fletcher Christian (Brando) just hides in his cabin on the ship, utterly depressed, while his fellow mutineers party it up on the island. This is a great, realistic scene.

Part of the problem is Marlon Brando's oddly mannered performance (and horrible attempt at a British accent!), but by the film's end Brando will grow on you... in fact, there's a dramatic payoff to his icy aloofness. What the film's critics are really rebelling against is the refashioning of what many consider a perfect movie. With typical '60s relativism, the story's heroic aspects are undercut by a much darker and complex plotline... Trevor Howard's Captain Bligh remains, like Laughton's, a greedy and cruel man, but in this version he is much more sympathetic. Here, Bligh is needled and derided by first mate Fletcher Christian, an aristocratic fop who looks down his nose at his rigid, uptight commander. Brando's character is also a breezy dilletante ultimately driven to act on the sailor's behalf as much by his rivalry with Bligh as by any moral concerns. The sailors see this situation and, as Bligh's repressive behavior comes to a boil, they cynically exploit Christian's hatred of the captain to push him, unwillingly, to lead the mutiny. The ending of the film is markedly different, as well, and for anyone willing to entertain this story's historical value, the new view of Pitcairn Island is worth checking out. The long interlude on Tahiti, though a bit racist and tinged by a dated, Hugh Hefner-y sense of naughtiness, is also quite compelling... It also includes some nice, reasonably authentic Polynesian dancing, and a compelling scene where Brando meets his non-English speaking bride. Of the two films, this one feels much more real, with rich details that go beyond the original story of right and wrong.

We all have our favorite pairing of Christian and Bligh.  I have few problems with any of the three--although Brando's version is the most foppish Fletcher Christian of all.  (And his English accent is atrocious.)  In any event, the 1962 remake of the classic tale MUTINY ON THE BOUNTY has become a classic itself--even though it was not well received back when it was released.  Marlon Brando brings his own brand of roguish charm as second officer Christian; Trevor Howard portrays Captain Bligh as a sadistic, almost evil, tyrant.  (His version of Bligh is easily the least likable.)  We're all familiar with the tale of HMS Bounty, commissioned in 1789 to sail to Tahiti to collect breadfruit plants to feed to slaves in the British Empire.  In order to reach their destination before the plant's dormant season, Bligh is ruthless with his crew, pushing them ever harder to save time and sail faster.  Officers and sailors alike become disgruntled and demoralized, and Bligh's behavior draws the ire of Lt. Christian, who although he follows captain's orders is developing a disrespectful attitude (and from Bligh's perspective the disrespect is mutual).  Yet the Bounty reaches Tahiti, and here the crew receives a long overdue respite, and enjoys spending time on the island--and in the arms of the gorgeous native women.  Several members of the crew are sorely tempted to desert, yet none do as the Bounty, now loaded down with breadfruit plants, sets sail for Jamaica.It is on this leg of the journey the men revolt.  Because the plants need plenty of fresh water, Bligh cruelly rations it for the men, hanging the water ladle from the top mast.  This is the tipping point; once a crewman weak with thirst falls to his death, Christian seizes the Bounty, placing Bligh and those still loyal to him in a schooner to be cast adrift.  Christian is of course tormented by his actions, realizing the Bounty will be on the run for the rest of its days.  The ship returns to Tahiti to collect natives who wish to accompany the sailors no matter where they go.  An island that is coincidentally misplaced on all shipping charts by hundreds of miles is selected, and even though Christian is convinced the Bounty should return to England to plead the crew's case, MUTINY ON THE BOUNTY ends quite tragically.I enjoyed watching a very young Richard Harris play disgruntled Seaman Mills; other solid supporting roles include Hugh Griffith and Gordon Jackson.  Again, Brando is charming and Howard quite evil, the cinematography often majestic, and the story timeless.

Glasby,"[0, 3]","I have just Pre-ordered the 1962 version of MUTINY ON THE BOUNTY on BluRay DVD, which should prove an excellent example for the advanced DVD system.With the huge cast and stunning location photography, the period costumes and especially, the fantastic storm sequence (which is amply brilliant even on normal DVD) this is a perfect film for BluRay.However, it must be hoped that AMAZON can correct their Site re the film being processed at only 1.77 to 1 when photography actually occurred in Super Panavision 70mm.As an aside, I recall arranging an Office Theatre Party at MGM's sadly demolished beautiful City Flagship Cinema in Sydney, the St. JAMES Theatre, on Bounty's initial theatrical release, when one hundred and two people attended a capacity evening performance - our largest office-group attendance ever for a movie. I think the one for PSYCHO was around sixty people two years earlier.For Mutiny on the Bounty, the St. James had installed a new and larger screen and some rows of seats in the front stalls were covered due to possible viewing problems.There have been negative comments for this version of BOUNTY over the years, but is remains an exceptionally entertaining Blockbuster-type production into which a lot of incredible technical talent was poured.Bronislau Kaper's rousing Music Score is also a bonus.Looking forward to this BluRay release which is at a very commendable bargain price.Eric GLASBY  AUSTRALIA",5,MUTINY ON THE BOUNTY 1962 ON BLURAY - GREAT!,1312761600,"08 8, 2011",2011,1434,"['have', 'just', 'Pre-ordered', '1962', 'version', 'MUTINY', 'ON', 'THE', 'BOUNTY', 'BluRay', 'DVD', 'should', 'prove', 'excellent', 'example', 'advanced', 'DVD', 'huge', 'cast', 'stunning', 'location', 'photography', 'period', 'costumes', 'especially', 'fantastic', 'storm', 'sequence', 'amply', 'brilliant', 'even', 'normal', 'DVD', 'perfect', 'film', 'BluRay.However', 'must', 'be', 'hoped', 'AMAZON', 'can', 'correct', 'Site', 'film', 'being', 'processed', 'only', '1.77', '1', 'when', 'photography', 'actually', 'occurred', 'Super', 'Panavision', '70mm.As', 'aside', 'recall', 'arranging', 'Office', 'Theatre', 'Party', 'MGM', 'sadly', 'demolished', 'beautiful', 'City', 'Flagship', 'Cinema', 'Sydney', 'St.', 'JAMES', 'Theatre', 'Bounty', 'initial', 'theatrical', 'release', 'when', 'one', 'hundred', 'two', 'people', 'attended', 'capacity', 'evening', 'performance', 'largest', 'office-group', 'attendance', 'ever', 'movie', 'think', 'one', 'PSYCHO', 'was', 'sixty', 'people', 'two', 'years', 'earlier.For', 'Mutiny', 'Bounty', 'St.', 'James', 'had', 'installed', 'new', 'larger', 'screen', 'rows', 'seats', 'front', 'stalls', 'were', 'covered', 'due', 'possible', 'viewing', 'problems.There', 'have', 'been', 'negative', 'comments', 'version', 'BOUNTY', 'years', 'exceptionally', 'entertaining', 'Blockbuster-type', 'production', 'lot', 'incredible', 'technical', 'talent', 'was', 'poured.Bronislau', 'Kaper', 'rousing', 'Music', 'Score', 'also', 'bonus.Looking', 'forward', 'BluRay', 'release', 'very', 'commendable', 'bargain', 'price.Eric', 'GLASBY', 'AUSTRALIA']",N/A
137053,A3CWH6VKCTJAD,0792836545,"""flickjunkie""","[98, 105]","When the news broke that MGM had the audacity to remake the hallowed 1935 classic ""Mutiny on the Bounty"" starring Clark Gable and Charles Laughton, the critics were aghast.  As the news leaked out about trouble in production, they whipped themselves into a self-righteous frenzy.  Brando was a lightening rod for criticism because he was renowned as arrogant hothead.  Compared with Gable, who was universally loved and adored, Brando was a boor.  It was almost sacrilegious to put Brando in any part Gable had played.  When the film opened, it never had a chance.  It was ripped to shreds.  Brando was ridiculed as a lower class character actor who couldn't step up to the part, and derided for his dreadful attempt at an English accent.  The film was a box office loser and critics smugly declared they told us so.The film was beset by problems throughout production.  The full-scale replica of the Bounty arrived on location two months after the film was scheduled to begin shooting.  There were three deaths among the film's personnel and the film ran well over budget.  The biggest problems were the result of Brando's constant temper tantrums as he tried to rewrite the entire film from the set.  At least six writers came and went.  After countless confrontations, director Carol Reed gave up and quit to be replaced by Lewis Milestone (""All Quiet on the Western Front').  Milestone was an utterly intractable director that Brando couldn't bully.  The result was a battle between the immovable object and the irresistible force, with daily emotional pyrotechnics that further delayed the film.  Although Milestone usually prevailed in the fracases, this film turned out to be his last in a 37-year career.Over the years, the critics have continued to pillory the film, but the public generally receives it more favorably as time passes.  Though I often disagree with the masses, in this case I concur.  Having seen both the 1935 and 1962 versions, I prefer the latter.  Gable is clearly more charming and dashing in the role, but Brando gives the more complete performance.  Gable's Christian seems far less ruffled by the events that transpire on the Bounty, whereas Brando accomplishes a believable transition from the cavalier rogue to an honorable hero who endures self-torment over the treasonous act.  Though Brando's English accent is oft ridiculed, I have heard far worse.  Part of the problem probably stemmed from the fact that the accent he attempted to imitate was very upper crust and he delivered it with a certain sneering tone that made it seem like he was mocking the English.  Just hearing that accent from the same lips that gave us, ""I coulda been a contenda"" was a kind of ironic comedy unto itself.Between the Bligh portrayed by Charles Laughton and that depicted by Trevor Howard in the remake, Howard wins hands down for pure detestability.  Most of the production values, such as music, set design and costumes were superior in the remake.  Moreover, the remake was more historically accurate than the original.The film features a youthful Richard Harris in the role of Mills, who gives an excellent performance of the petulant sailor.  Also noteworthy is the lovely Tarita, a native Tahitian who plays Christian's love interest Maimiti, and does a scorching belly dance.  This was Tarita's only film, but to anyone who has seen the film, she will not be soon forgotten.This is an excellent film.  It was nominated for seven Oscars including Best Picture, but it was shut out, trampled by ""Lawrence of Arabia"".  It is highly entertaining with wonderful costumes, props and sets, fabulous locations and photography, and some terrific performances.  Though many will disagree, I rated it a 10/10.  If one can step back from the controversy that swirled around this film when it debuted, it is an easy film to enjoy.",5,An excellent motion picture.,988243200,"04 26, 2001",2001,3845,"['When', 'news', 'broke', 'MGM', 'had', 'audacity', 'remake', 'hallowed', '1935', 'classic', 'Mutiny', 'Bounty', 'starring', 'Clark', 'Gable', 'Charles', 'Laughton', 'critics', 'were', 'aghast', 'news', 'leaked', 'out', 'trouble', 'production', 'whipped', 'self-righteous', 'frenzy', 'Brando', 'was', 'lightening', 'rod', 'criticism', 'was', 'renowned', 'arrogant', 'hothead', 'Compared', 'Gable', 'who', 'was', 'universally', 'loved', 'adored', 'Brando', 'was', 'boor', 'was', 'almost', 'sacrilegious', 'put', 'Brando', 'part', 'Gable', 'had', 'played', 'When', 'film', 'opened', 'never', 'had', 'chance', 'was', 'ripped', 'shreds', 'Brando', 'was', 'ridiculed', 'lower', 'class', 'character', 'actor', 'who', 'could', ""n't"", 'step', 'up', 'part', 'derided', 'dreadful', 'attempt', 'English', 'accent', 'film', 'was', 'box', 'office', 'loser', 'critics', 'smugly', 'declared', 'told', 'so.The', 'film', 'was', 'beset', 'problems', 'production', 'full-scale', 'replica', 'Bounty', 'arrived', 'location', 'two', 'months', 'film', 'was', 'scheduled', 'begin', 'shooting', 'were', 'three', 'deaths', 'film', 'personnel', 'film', 'ran', 'well', 'budget', 'biggest', 'problems', 'were', 'result', 'Brando', 'constant', 'temper', 'tantrums', 'tried', 'rewrite', 'entire', 'film', 'set', 'least', 'six', 'writers', 'came', 'went', 'countless', 'confrontations', 'director', 'Carol', 'Reed', 'gave', 'up', 'quit', 'be', 'replaced', 'Lewis', 'Milestone', 'Quiet', 'Western', 'Front', 'Milestone', 'was', 'utterly', 'intractable', 'director', 'Brando', 'could', ""n't"", 'bully', 'result', 'was', 'battle', 'immovable', 'object', 'irresistible', 'force', 'daily', 'emotional', 'pyrotechnics', 'further', 'delayed', 'film', 'Milestone', 'usually', 'prevailed', 'fracases', 'film', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'last', '37-year', 'career.Over', 'years', 'critics', 'have', 'continued', 'pillory', 'film', 'public', 'generally', 'more', 'favorably', 'time', 'passes', 'often', 'disagree', 'masses', 'case', 'concur', 'Having', 'seen', '1935', '1962', 'versions', 'prefer', 'latter', 'Gable', 'clearly', 'more', 'charming', 'dashing', 'role', 'Brando', 'more', 'complete', 'performance', 'Gable', 'Christian', 'far', 'less', 'ruffled', 'events', 'transpire', 'Bounty', 'Brando', 'believable', 'transition', 'cavalier', 'rogue', 'honorable', 'hero', 'who', 'self-torment', 'treasonous', 'act', 'Brando', 'English', 'accent', 'oft', 'ridiculed', 'have', 'heard', 'far', 'worse', 'Part', 'problem', 'probably', 'stemmed', 'fact', 'accent', 'attempted', 'imitate', 'was', 'very', 'upper', 'crust', 'delivered', 'certain', 'sneering', 'tone', 'made', 'was', 'mocking', 'English', 'Just', 'hearing', 'accent', 'same', 'gave', 'coulda', 'been', 'contenda', 'was', 'kind', 'ironic', 'comedy', 'itself.Between', 'Bligh', 'portrayed', 'Charles', 'Laughton', 'depicted', 'Trevor', 'Howard', 'remake', 'Howard', 'hands', 'down', 'pure', 'detestability', 'Most', 'production', 'values', 'such', 'music', 'set', 'design', 'costumes', 'were', 'superior', 'remake', 'Moreover', 'remake', 'was', 'more', 'historically', 'accurate', 'original.The', 'film', 'youthful', 'Richard', 'Harris', 'role', 'Mills', 'who', 'excellent', 'performance', 'petulant', 'sailor', 'Also', 'noteworthy', 'lovely', 'Tarita', 'native', 'Tahitian', 'who', 'Christian', 'love', 'interest', 'Maimiti', 'scorching', 'belly', 'dance', 'was', 'Tarita', 'only', 'film', 'anyone', 'who', 'seen', 'film', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'soon', 'forgotten.This', 'excellent', 'film', 'was', 'nominated', 'seven', 'Oscars', 'including', 'Best', 'Picture', 'was', 'shut', 'out', 'trampled', 'Lawrence', 'Arabia', 'highly', 'entertaining', 'wonderful', 'costumes', 'props', 'sets', 'fabulous', 'locations', 'photography', 'terrific', 'performances', 'many', 'will', 'disagree', 'rated', '10/10', 'one', 'can', 'step', 'back', 'controversy', 'swirled', 'film', 'when', 'debuted', 'easy', 'film', 'enjoy']",N/A

It's a very long movie that comes in two parts on two CDs. The first CD recorded the passage of the Bounty from Great Britain, around the southern edge (Cape Horn) of South America and to it's final stopping place in Tahiti. It's a dramatic voyage, to be sure, and the storm reconstructions we're magnificent. I'm amazed that this was all put together prior to 1962, long before the days of computer animations. The acting and filming was so good you felt you were a part of the voyage. Then superimposed upon this journey was the growing cruelty of Captain Bligh and the growing dissatisfaction of his crew and Fletcher Christian. Things settled down after a five-month vacation in Tahiti.Part two took up with the leaving of Tahiti for the return trip to England. Almost as soon as the voyage started there were troubles with water rations where the plants on board were given priority over the crew by Captain Bligh. A couple incidents escalated into a mutiny with Captain Bligh and 18 crew members cut loose to fare for themselves in a small boat while the Bounty with Fletcher Christian in command headed back to Tahiti and ultimately settled in Pitcairan Island. Eventually, Captain Christian decided to return to England and ""face the music"" and that resulted in a second mutiny, so to speak, and the Bounty was burned and sunk. Excellent story.

It got DVR'd off cable TV and we watched it in 2 roughly 90 minutes chunks recently.Overall, it is an entertaining movie. Like most such movies, it does not portray the events of the mutiny with much in the way of historical accuracy. Very few movies inspired by real events ever depict them in an accurate way.

The music and the filming is well done. The scenery adds to the movie.Trevor Howard plays a moderately crazy ship's captain pretty well. Brando plays his 2nd officer as a fop who never really meshed well with his captain. Parts of Brando's portrayal are really good, but sometimes he goes a little off the deep end. In my mind, neither one was really suitable officer materiel, but historically many British naval officers were basically nuts, so at least that part of the story has some historical accuracy to it.I never quite believed that Captain Bligh was able to drive Fletcher Christian to mutiny solely by his acts of cruelty toward the crew. That part was a bit sketchy. The reality is that at the time brutality toward the average seaman was a common thing in the British navy and an experienced officer like Fletcher Christian would have learned to deal with it.I never quite understood why Fletcher put the captain off on a row boat. Just throw him overboard and be done with him. But, British officers at the time had some weird notions of how the upper class treated each other.I never believed Fletcher Christian ever wanted to go back to London either.

But this is not the best film version of the story.  Brando is miscast as Fletcher Christian, playing him as a snob who despises Bligh (Trevor Howard) not for his cruelty, but rather because he believes he is superior to him.  And Howard acts heavy handed in his role, much like Charles Laughton did in the 1935 version.  The best treatment so far of this tale is the 1984 Australian production featuring Anthony Hopkins giving a more nuanced performance as Bligh, and Mel Gibson giving the Christian part more energy than the others (Clark Gable in '35).

Bligh's name has become synonymous with tyrannical military leadership.In 1787 the HMS Bounty is sent on a mission to the far side of the world, to the Tahitian Islands, in order to collect plants known as breadfruit. The intent is to transplant the food source to Jamaica, where it is hoped that they can be used to feed the slave population there.Even before departing, the ship is placed on a timetable, albeit a fuzzy one: the plant may not be transportable during its dormant period, but the botanist is vague as to when that will be. In an effort to get to Tahiti with time to spare, Captain Bligh (played extremely well by actor Trevor Howard) attempts to use a shortcut through Cape Horn. The passage around South America is extremely dangerous and storms and freezing temperatures eventually force Captain Bligh to turn back and to go by way of the Cape of Good Hope, having already lost many precious weeks in his ill-fated Cape Horn attempt.During all of this Mr. Christian, the second-in-command, demonstrates his empathy with the sailors even as Bligh shows his intention to rule the ship with iron discipline. Christian (played by Marlon Brando) comes off as a fop while the ship is still in port but is an experienced sailor and in his own way an excellent officer.Needless to say, the conflict between Bligh and Christian eventually develops into open mutiny, especially during the return trip when Bligh makes another poor decision which leaves the crew short of drinking water. Bligh and his loyalists are put adrift in an open boat. Not seen in the movie is Bligh's remarkable act of seamanship, sailing 3,700 miles across the Pacific to a port where they can make passage on a British vessel (rather than being marooned on some relatively close islands, as Mr. Christian had hoped).The movie is fascinating. Severe punishments were the norm in the Royal Navy during this period, but there was adventure to be found and exotic locations to travel to. There's also drama and studies in leadership. The scenery and scope of the film was often filmed on location in the Pacific.If you've never seen this movie, you really ought to.",5,A great adventure to the far side of the world,1372982400,"07 5, 2013",2013,2235,"['History', 'not', 'been', 'kind', 'Captain', 'Bligh', 'movie', ""n't"", 'treat', 'better', 'Bligh', 'name', 'become', 'synonymous', 'tyrannical', 'military', 'leadership.In', '1787', 'HMS', 'Bounty', 'sent', 'mission', 'far', 'side', 'world', 'Tahitian', 'Islands', 'order', 'collect', 'plants', 'known', 'breadfruit', 'intent', 'transplant', 'food', 'source', 'Jamaica', 'where', 'hoped', 'can', 'be', 'used', 'feed', 'slave', 'population', 'there.Even', 'departing', 'ship', 'placed', 'timetable', 'fuzzy', 'one', 'plant', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'transportable', 'dormant', 'period', 'botanist', 'vague', 'when', 'will', 'be', 'effort', 'get', 'Tahiti', 'time', 'spare', 'Captain', 'Bligh', 'played', 'extremely', 'well', 'actor', 'Trevor', 'Howard', 'use', 'shortcut', 'Cape', 'Horn', 'passage', 'South', 'America', 'extremely', 'dangerous', 'storms', 'freezing', 'temperatures', 'eventually', 'force', 'Captain', 'Bligh', 'turn', 'back', 'go', 'way', 'Cape', 'Good', 'Hope', 'having', 'already', 'lost', 'many', 'precious', 'weeks', 'ill-fated', 'Cape', 'Horn', 'attempt.During', 'Mr.', 'Christian', 'second-in-command', 'empathy', 'sailors', 'even', 'Bligh', 'intention', 'rule', 'ship', 'iron', 'discipline', 'Christian', 'played', 'Marlon', 'Brando', 'off', 'fop', 'ship', 'still', 'port', 'experienced', 'sailor', 'own', 'way', 'excellent', 'officer.Needless', 'say', 'conflict', 'Bligh', 'Christian', 'eventually', 'open', 'mutiny', 'especially', 'return', 'trip', 'when', 'Bligh', 'poor', 'decision', 'crew', 'short', 'drinking', 'water', 'Bligh', 'loyalists', 'are', 'put', 'adrift', 'open', 'boat', 'Not', 'seen', 'movie', 'Bligh', 'remarkable', 'act', 'seamanship', 'sailing', '3,700', 'miles', 'Pacific', 'port', 'where', 'can', 'make', 'passage', 'British', 'vessel', 'rather', 'being', 'marooned', 'relatively', 'close', 'islands', 'Mr.', 'Christian', 'had', 'hoped', '.The', 'movie', 'fascinating', 'Severe', 'punishments', 'were', 'norm', 'Royal', 'Navy', 'period', 'there', 'was', 'adventure', 'be', 'found', 'exotic', 'locations', 'travel', 'also', 'drama', 'studies', 'leadership', 'scenery', 'scope', 'film', 'was', 'often', 'filmed', 'location', 'Pacific.If', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'movie', 'really', 'ought']",N/A

Sultanof,"[1, 1]","When I was a small boy and heard about films in such 70MM processes as Todd-AO and Ultra Panavision, I dreamed one day to have a screening room where films made in such processes would be screened that way, the way the film makers meant for these films to be seen. Over the years, elements of these films sat in vaults, and in the case of one of them (Brothers Grimm) was rendered 'lost' in 70MM due to water damage. With advanced film preservation equipment, these grand films are now actually being brought back to life (the Cinerama Corporation is now restoring almost all of the legendary 3 panel Cinerama films for festivals and home video).Laser disc and DVD were great, but Blu-ray finally allows these beautiful films to be seen and heard the way audiences first experienced them. And so it is a wonderful thing to say that thanks to HD-DVD and now Blu-ray, the Ultra Panavision version of the controversial 1962 Mutiny on the Bounty is back and better than ever.This is a wonderful film, hardly a family film, as this is tough material involving great cruelty and sadism, but a fascinating story. The photography and sound are stunning, often jaw dropping. The movie itself is far from the movie that critics destroyed back in 1962. Brando's British accent is more than acceptable, and his acting is excellent. Howard's Bligh is also excellent, a multi-dimensional characterization of a man who wishes to fulfill his mission, but does not care how cruel he has to be to do so.It is not worth comparing the 1935 and 1962 film versions of this story. Each film has its strengths and both have excellent performances. But at least both are now available in top-notch editions. The 1935 edition has always been considered a classic.

137068,A245AST0T0AZTJ,0792836545,J. Lindner,"[1, 1]","This adaptation of the classic mutiy story is well written and well acted.  Trevor Howard plays Captain Bligh and shows the stubborness and arrogance that led the HMS Bounty to fail in its mission to obtain the breadfruit plants.  Because of the captain's arrogance and his subsequent refusal to accept responsiblity for his decisions, the ship arrived too late to obtain the desired plants during their dormant season.  The result was frustration and blame all around.But there is a saving grace for the ship's crew.  The sympathetic second in command, Fletcher Christian, does not agree with the harsh punishments issued to the crew for their various offenses and becomes a rallying point as the ship's crew opts to deny their captain his authority over them.  The fact that there is an ample supply of attractive native women to welcome the men, it is all the easier for discipline to break down completely aboard ship.  Thus the men decide to forgo their maritime duties and choose to live out their days in a Pacific paradise.Well, it's not nearly so rosy for the mutineers as it could have been.  The natives, while having looser morals than the Englishmen are accustomed to, are after all human.  Being trapped on their island paradise eventaully loses its appeal and the mutineers are subject to everyday survival.The movie's special effects and other production features make it well worth the effort to watch it.  The acting is well done and the viewer gets to experience the dangers of a nineteenth century sea voyage.  Cape Horn is the most dangerous stretch of water ships can navigate.  Make the ship a wooden sailing ship and it is all the more challenging.

What's amazing is the crud leveled at this film and how it's endured all these years diminishing any credit due it. Brando ruined it, was troublesome, difficult to work with, cost MGM lots of $$$; Bunk! I saw this movie for the first time when it came out in '62 and it knocked me off my feet; I was ten yrs old. I appreciate it so much more today as an adult. It's a darn fine movie, take my word for it. The photography is STUNNING, period costumes great, the pagentry and colors of Tahiti take your breath away. They built a replica of the Bounty from the keel up, a feat truly remarkable. The music by Bronislau Kaper is superb and can measure up to that of Lawrence of Arabia, El Cid, King of Kings and Doctor Zhivago any day. The Love Theme is both haunting & Beautiful. The pace of the film flows very well and never once does it drag. Brando & Howard play well off each other. Richard Harris as Mills gives a fine performance along with the other character actors playing the crew. The interplay between Bligh & Christian builds just the right amount of tension. You can feel Fletcher Christian's contempt for Bligh growing more with every scene. The foppish, self centered intellectual suddenly thinking of things greater than himself, being drawn in to see the injustice & cruelty leveled at the crew. Maybe for the first time in his life Christian now knows the difference between right & wrong. He's forced to see that rule books & regulations do not make a captain. Especially one who seems to have nothing but disdain for his crew, beating them like dogs, starving them, stripping away their dignity. Bligh is a man without honor wanting desperately & only to further his own career in the British Navy, no matter who he has to crush or kill to get there. To sail around the Horn in the middle of Winter just to shave a couple of months off the voyage, risking both ship & crew. Depriving men of water in order to water plants. We the viewer are pushed to the edge along with Christian. Brando allows us to witness the smoldering powder keg within him. Then the film grants us relief as we sail & land into Paradise. Humor is put in at just the right places. When Bligh tells Christian to make love to the kings daughter in order not to offend him & Christian makes him squirm doing so, it's hysterical. I'm not sure there was a need for any great acting between Brando & Tarita, who plays the kings daughter, the sparks fly well enough on their own. The Island, the beaches, the sunsets over the ocean are truly magnificent. The native women are sensual innocence & breathtaking. You can plainly see why the crew would never want to leave this Island Paradise. The mutiny is very powerful. Christian is driven to commit this act by continued actions against the crew from Bligh & goaded by Mills; the powder keg explodes. The final scenes with Brando are beautifally acted and I have to say that I am so pleased that the original prologue & epilogue are included here because they are the perfect bookends to the movie. They set and end it wonderfully. Why they were ever taken out to begin with is beyond me. I can only say in closing that this two disc collection is great. The special features include some history, the construction of the Bounty and it's restoration over 30 years later. I would've liked some behind the scenes interviews with cast & crew but that's only a minor swipe. The original overture, intermission & entr' acte are here to make this feel like an old fashioned movie going experience that we don't see anymore.

Jamele,"[1, 1]","Most of the main issues one could have with this film- bad acting, ponderous pace, Brando's stilted performance, Howard's almost equally stiff outing, etc.- have already been dealt with, so I'll just nitpick on a few things that jumped out at me-1.  Brando, almost alone among the entire crew except perhaps Bligh and Fryer, never ever EVER loosens up during the entire voyage.  For chrissakes, the man is wearing his dress uniform on PITCAIRN'S ISLAND near the end of the film- which is supposed to be more than TWO YEARS after the ship set sail from Spithead. And- hysterically-the breeches and shirtwaist of the uniform are still gleaming white- were British naval vessels of the 18th century known for their dry-cleaning services?  Clark Gable and Mel Gibson had the good sense to dress down on occasion.  Brando spends the entire film acting as if it's perpetually 60 degrees out and he has an audience with the Admiral of the Fleet in five minutes.  At LEAST show some stains on his freaking uniform after TWO YEARS!2.  As usual, the actor portraying Bligh is TOO OLD, and the Bligh-Christian relationship involves a generation gap.  In fact, Bligh was only 33 years old when the Bounty sailed- only a ten year difference between Bligh and Christian, not the 20 or more which is always portrayed in these films.  Bligh looks like he could be Christian's father here.3.  The agonizingly long, painfully inaccurate death scene written for Brando at the end- it was as if the director didn't really want the film to end, and didn't know how to end it. Never mind the ridiculous ""let's go back"" scene- that's been covered, and it's only slightly more offensive than the ""Some Say Christian returned safely to England"" line at the end of 1985's THE BOUNTY.  We KNOW Christian never considered returning to England, was quite happy establishing a life for himself and his wife and child on Pitcairn's Island, and was murdered during the white-native civil war which erupted on the island in 1793.

137072,A1UI2N2LBGVKC7,0792836545,"Johnny S Geddes ""OC""","[37, 42]","Perhaps that review title's too harsh. I loved the '62 version primarily because of how the extremes of production expense shoved it forward as an all-time great. To understand its power one has to see its standing in  relation to the two other versions. The 1935 film has a pre-Errol Flynn  swashbuckler ambience that tries to coexist with an overall moodier feel  brought on by dour, flat direction. The 1984 movie tries too hard to  establish historical correctness while superimposing Mel Gibson's  prettiness over the sour conditions underlying the vessel and the voyage.  At any rate, these elements take out much of the fun of these versions and,  in the latter case, it's even arguable that its weighty atmosphere defuses  the thrill of the mutiny altogether. Nothing spectacular in these.Lewis Milestone directed an infinitely more entertaining affair on the 1962  version. Marlon Brando's attempt at Englishness is thoroughly derisable but  we forgive him for it because there's much comic relief to be had in that  as well as in the way he spars with Trevor Howard. The crew are alotted  more respect by the camera in this film and that freedom yields more  entertaining results than the sordid festering they endure to be found in  the most recent version.No. This is a three hour adventure that is  fun for all the family. At times funny (echoes of Gilbert and Sullivan  drift into my head every once in a while when I watch Brando strutting  about on the poop deck), at times poignant, this is maybe the biggest of  the giants Metro Goldwyn Mayer committed to celluloid. It's important to  keep in mind that studios were still having their honeymoon with Eastman  colour 40 years ago and it isn't surprising at all that the tale of the  Bounty was selected for a reworking on this grandiose scale. Full of images  and sounds that do nothing but please the soul, 'Mutiny on the Bounty' is a  masterpiece with no bad actors aboard (Richard Harris is at his best here  as the chief fomentor of rebellion 'downstairs'). When viewed from any  angle, it's still a dazzling chandelier of a movie. They don't make them  like this anymore not because they won't - it's simply because the style  involved here is out of the reach of any filmmaker or producer alive today.  Probably a year or more in the making, the Sixties Bounty film is  irrefutably the definitive one and the effects of watching it once are  guarranteed to incite many subsequent viewings, not merely to drink up the  haunting beauty of the location camera work. This is an essential component  of any family's movie collection that must be bought as soon as possible.",5,Great fun that can borderline self-parody at times.,951523200,"02 26, 2000",2000,2642,"['Perhaps', 'review', 'title', 'too', 'harsh', 'loved', ""'62"", 'version', 'primarily', 'how', 'extremes', 'production', 'expense', 'shoved', 'forward', 'all-time', 'great', 'understand', 'power', 'one', 'see', 'standing', 'relation', 'two', 'other', 'versions', '1935', 'film', 'pre-Errol', 'Flynn', 'swashbuckler', 'ambience', 'coexist', 'overall', 'moodier', 'feel', 'brought', 'dour', 'flat', 'direction', '1984', 'movie', 'tries', 'too', 'hard', 'establish', 'historical', 'correctness', 'superimposing', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'prettiness', 'sour', 'conditions', 'underlying', 'vessel', 'voyage', 'rate', 'elements', 'take', 'out', 'much', 'fun', 'versions', 'latter', 'case', 'even', 'arguable', 'weighty', 'atmosphere', 'thrill', 'mutiny', 'altogether', 'Nothing', 'spectacular', 'these.Lewis', 'Milestone', 'directed', 'infinitely', 'more', 'entertaining', 'affair', '1962', 'version', 'Marlon', 'Brando', 'attempt', 'Englishness', 'thoroughly', 'derisable', 'forgive', 'much', 'comic', 'relief', 'be', 'had', 'as', 'well', 'way', 'Trevor', 'Howard', 'crew', 'are', 'alotted', 'more', 'respect', 'camera', 'film', 'freedom', 'more', 'entertaining', 'results', 'sordid', 'festering', 'endure', 'be', 'found', 'most', 'recent', 'version.No', 'three', 'hour', 'adventure', 'fun', 'family', 'times', 'funny', 'echoes', 'Gilbert', 'Sullivan', 'drift', 'head', 'once', 'while', 'when', 'watch', 'Brando', 'strutting', 'about', 'poop', 'deck', 'times', 'poignant', 'maybe', 'biggest', 'giants', 'Metro', 'Goldwyn', 'Mayer', 'committed', 'celluloid', 'important', 'keep', 'mind', 'studios', 'were', 'still', 'having', 'honeymoon', 'Eastman', 'colour', '40', 'years', 'ago', ""n't"", 'surprising', 'tale', 'Bounty', 'was', 'selected', 'reworking', 'grandiose', 'scale', 'Full', 'images', 'sounds', 'do', 'nothing', 'please', 'soul', 'Bounty', 'masterpiece', 'bad', 'actors', 'Richard', 'Harris', 'best', 'here', 'chief', 'fomentor', 'rebellion', ""'downstairs"", 'When', 'viewed', 'angle', 'still', 'dazzling', 'chandelier', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'anymore', 'not', 'wo', ""n't"", 'simply', 'style', 'involved', 'here', 'reach', 'filmmaker', 'producer', 'alive', 'today', 'Probably', 'year', 'more', 'making', 'Sixties', 'Bounty', 'film', 'irrefutably', 'definitive', 'one', 'effects', 'watching', 'once', 'are', 'guarranteed', 'incite', 'many', 'subsequent', 'viewings', 'not', 'merely', 'drink', 'up', 'haunting', 'beauty', 'location', 'camera', 'work', 'essential', 'component', 'family', 'movie', 'collection', 'must', 'be', 'bought', 'as', 'soon', 'possible']",N/A

William Bligh treated his men as well as any Captain in the 1790's maybe even better, having learned from the Great James Cook himself.The actual mutiny sequence has nothing, but absolutly nothing remotely to do with how it happened. Fletcher Christian, along with 3 other sailors, stormed Bligh sleeping quaters early in the morning and tied his hands behind his back. It was NEVER in reaction to Bligh refusing to give water to a dying sailor.  The worst part in my opinion is last 15 minutes of the movie.

Many people loved the original '35 version and simply weren't open to a remake. I'm unbiased on the issue and own all three. Take it from me, the Brando version is far superior to the '35 black & white version in all departments. (I think perhaps people are just nostalgic about that older Clark Gable version). I also really love the more realistic Gibson version and highly reccomend it, but this Brando version is simply more compelling and more awesomely photographed.One great scene depicts Fletcher Christian (Brando) after the muntiny secluded in his cabin on the ship, utterly depressed, while his fellow mutineers party it up on the island.

Therefore, let me state emphatically that  THIS VERSION IS NOTHING LESS THAN A COMPLETE TRAVESTY OF THE REAL  CHARACTERS AND EVENTS! (The 1935 version was IMMEASURABLY closer to the  truth!) Among the 100% fictional parts that comprise this utter  chief's daughter; a wretchedly inaccurate account of the actual mutiny;  Christian stabbing Bligh with a sword; Christian, after arriving at  Pitcairn's Island, wishing to return to England to be hanged(!); Christian  dying of burn wounds in the burning of the &quot;Bounty&quot;; and  innumerable other insultingly brainless excrescences that we're being asked  to swallow. 2.) One cannot make heads nor tails of the Fletcher Christian  character, as one positively could in the '35 version. Here, the boorish  Brando attempts to chew the scenery by combining specious eccentricacy with  a furrowed brow allegedly suggesting inner turmoil. He in fact drove Carol  Reed, the original director, off the project, taking the captain's reins  himself; and kept the poor, aging Lewis Milestone--who received  credit--under his heel. His haughty audience-manipulation only succeeds to  bore and offend. 3.) What the film is trying to say remains obscure; as  it's details fail to convince, and as it's themes seem to vary as the trade  winds blow. The film at times brings up issues of power-abuse, racism,  socio-political hypocrisy, etc.; and then drops them without exploring  them.  Even if it overplays the sadism angle, at least the '35 version  stuck to it's attack of 18th century British naval injustice! Now,  cinematically, all this film has going for it is brochure-like photography  of the South Seas; as it certainly does not enlighten or entertain at any  level. The three-hour running time at first attracted me, for the story of  the mutiny on the &quot;Bounty&quot; is perfect for being told at  epic-length, and the rounding off of events in the '35 version was a bit  disappointing.  However, instead of a careful, composed recreation of the  actual events, this disaster turned out an endless crawl through someone's  fantasia of history.  This review is the only &quot;fruits&quot; of my  viewing of this resplendent bore. Acting is variable, to say the least.  Brando's pretentious maunderings are unwatchable; Trevor Howard--great  actor that he is--at times sounds like he's reading off the idiot boards;  others, such as Richard Harris, Hugh Griffith, and Richard Haydn, fail to  make an impact at all.  Scenes are oddly theatrical in style; especially  the mutiny--so perfectly filmed as a montage of confusion and violence in  the '35 version--seem like nothing so much as a bad rehearsal for an  off-Broadway play. Easily the best of it--beautiful photography--remind one  ruining it's gorgeous scenery whenever the dull characters get in the way.  In summary, when this molehill of a movie crept to it's long-winded  conclusion, it did indeed make me think. I thought, &quot;What in hell was  that all about; and what in hell did these people think they were  doing?&quot; If they thought they were improving on the '35 version, they  were sorely mistaken. Gable played Fletcher Christian as a far more  believable human being than Brando's idiotical portrayal. He's gregarious  and cheerful (real human traits), but his conscience, temper, and  thoughtfulness are brilliantly conveyed by Clark Gable. Reviewers here  criticize Gable's &quot;Christian&quot; as a &quot;swashbuckling  hero-type,&quot; missing the fact that he does no rope-swinging, jumping,  or exhultating!  That he does not weild a single weapon in the movie, other  than to take it away from others! That Gable during and after the mutiny,  shows clear signs of a troubled conscience! Apparently, they have fallen  victim to Brando's audience-manipulation.

In ""Mutiny on the Bounty"" I saw an opportunity for a really great movie because the story of the Bounty has been a favorite of mine since I read the ""Classics Illustrated"" comic book version of the trilogy (as a kid, of course).  Although I was somewhat taken aback at Brando's appearance as a ""dandy"", I thought he did a good job as Fletcher Christian as did Trevor Howard as Captain Bligh.  The bantering between each other was part of the excellence of the film.  The rest of the cast was obviously chosen with care as well.  The cinematography, the Tahitian location, the depiction of life at sea, all kept my interest even though the movie must have run about three hours.My problem with this version of ""Mutiny on the Bounty"" had to do with the use of those three hours and the historically clumsy way the movie ended.  Although the crux of the movie is obviously found in its' title, there were two other stories of that historical event of great interest as well.  One was the amazing sea journey of the castaways (those that didn't mutiny) and the other was the il-fated future of the mutineers themselves.  The first was merely hinted at while the second culminated in a dramatic act of moral courage that, historically, never even ocurred.  I'll leave it to the viewers to discover for themselves what to make of the ending but, in my opinion, the truth told a much greater moral tale of what happens when orderly society is replaced with an aimless existance.  There is much to be learned and bemoaned about those that found their way to Pitcairn Island.  It is the real tragedy of the Bounty's fate; not the made-for-Hollywood substitution.

If you have seen the blu-rays of ZULU, BEN HUR or CLEOPATRA, you will know what can be done with the widescreen epics of the late 50s and 60s. This BD is more comparable to the very poor transfer of SPARTACUS. Apparently this release is simply a 1080p version of the 2006 issue.  The main problem is lack of image clarity. And the cause would seem to be, once again, excessive use of DNR (Digital Noise Reduction). This blu-ray doesn't show the slightest bit of film grain.  Since grain is inherent to the film medium, removing it results in loss of image sharpness.  There also seems to be some dispute about whether the transfer was made from the original 65mm negative or a later 35mm reduction.The sound of this BD, however, is newly transferred and is quite remarkable.  Kaper's score and the ocean sounds are magnificently rendered.Since Warner is not likely to immediately redo their transfer, this disc is still worth watching.

You'll probably recognize other veteran British actors as well......Richard Harris, Hugh Griffith, and Gordon Jackson.What stands out most in &#34;Mutiny on the Bounty&#34; is the lush cinematography under the direction of Robert Surtees, who a few years earlier won an Oscar for his work in &#34;Ben-Hur.&#34;  Also of worthy note is Bronislau Kaper's music score and the song &#34;Follow Follow Me,&#34; complimenting the romantic scenes involving Fletcher Christian and a Tahitian woman.&#34;Muitiny on the Bounty&#34; was well above my expectations and is worth watching.

On its own, the movie has great acting, and is enjoyable watching, though it appears to have taken literary liberties. Knowing this now, I find the ending a little weak.All things considered, we will continue to call bossy, inflexible people ""Captain Bligh"" as both characterizations showed that, just to differing degrees.

137104,A3O536E2YOKK4Y,0792836545,Wuchak,"[8, 10]","Although there were two early Australian films addressing the mutiny on the Bounty story (one with Errol Flynn), the three available to the public and best known are 1.) The 1935 Oscar-winning black & white version with Clark Gable as Fletcher Christian; 2.) The 1962 Marlon Brando version; and 3.) The 1984 version with Mel Gibson simply titled ""The Bounty.""THE STORY: The famous mutiny story is so fascinating because it's TRUE. William Bligh, as acting Captain, was sent on a mission in December 1787 to pick up breadfruit plants from Tahiti and bring them back to England. Bligh intended on circumnavigating the globe to fulfill the mission. Unfortunately he and his crew failed to make it around Cape Horn, South America, and had to take the long way around Africa. It thus took them 10 months to reach Tahiti, wherein they were forced to stay another five months due to the breadfruit's ""dormant"" period. The natives were friendly and the women ultra-beautiful; the Bounty crew naturally fell under the spell of the Polynesian paradise, with the exception of Bligh, that is. Christian even married the king's daughter, Maimiti. But after five months they had to get on with their mission and return to Naval discipline and England. Three and a half weeks later on April 28, 1789, Fletcher took over the ship with 18 other muntineers. 22 remained loyal to Bligh and 2 others were neutral. Christian set Bligh and 18 loyalists adrift in the ship's launch boat. He then returned to Tahiti where he dropped off 16 men, but picked up 6 Tahitian men and 11 women. Christian then set forth with 8 other mutineers and the Tahitians to elude the Royal Navy, ultimately settling on Pitcairn Island, which was well off the beaten path and misplaced on Royal charts, seemingly a perfect hiding place to live out the rest of their days.Mel Gibson's version is certainly the most historically accurate and I definitely recommend seeing it, but Brando's version is the most epic in scope, as well as the most captivating and compelling despite its 3-hour length. As for the 1935 black & white version, I was extrememly disappointed with it. It's a fine film for its day, but it'll likely come across dated and fabricated to most modern viewers. Anyone who argues that it's the best version is tainted by nostalgia pure and simple. I'm unbiased on the issue and can assure you that both the 1962 and 1984 versions blow it out of the water in practically every area.How accurate is the 1962 version? Nitpickers like to grumble about historical inaccuracies, but the fact is that the entire gist of the story is accurate: Fletcher was born to an aristocratic family who were losing their wealth due to the widowed mother's irresponsible spending (why do you think he took the mission?); two cheeses did come up missing and Bligh was the real cuprit who unjustly blamed others; they did fail to sail around Cape Horn after only going 85 miles in a month (!); they did spend five months on Tahiti and Fletcher did romantically fall for Maimiti; after the mutiny Fletcher and his crew did ultimately end up stranded on Pitcairn Island where they set The Bounty ablaze; and Christian did ultimately die on Pitcairn, although in real life he lived for another three and a half years before being killed by one of the Tahitian men in a conlict that broke out between them and the British.There are a number of fabricated elements, however: Christian was only 23 years old when the mission started, whereas Brando is about 37 in the film; Bligh knew Fletcher and actually sailed with him twice before, whereas the film shows Bligh meeting Christian for the first time; the mutiny itself took place at night wherein Bligh was awakened by the mutineers not in the daytime over a ladle of water as shown in the film; and, lastly, Fletcher didn't die due to wounds received while attempting to retrieve items from his burning ship.Still, as stated above, the gist of the story is completely accurate.WHAT WORKS: Marlon Brando as Fletcher Christian is infinitely captivating, as well as Trevor Howard as Bligh. The viewer observes their relationship get steadily worse over the course of the story culminating in the mutiny. Although Bligh is depicted as an ultra-authoritarian, contemptible of his men and reveling in punishment, one gets the overall picture that he did what he did mostly because he was so hell bent on accomplishing his mission. After the mutiny fletcher points out that the Admiralty would likely consider Bligh's actions justifiable.I'm not defending Bligh, he obviously had some serious character flaws and became known in the fleet as ""that Bounty bast@#d."" In fact, later in his career he suffered ANOTHER mutiny in New South Wales, Australia! Although brilliant as a seaman, he was by all accounts an unlikable bastage to those around him. His arrogant, abusive nature obviously destroyed loyalty and drove people from him. Still, I respect the fact that the film doesn't depict him as a villain dripping with evil as does the 1935 version.There's a potent scene not long after the mutiny wherein Bligh and his 18 loyalists sit in the launch boat trying to figure out what to do. Bligh ultimately decides to sail to Timor, which was 3600 miles away, rather than strand themselves on some uncivilized island. What obviously drives Bligh's mad decision is his utter hatred of Christian and his desire for revenge. When some of the loyalists understandably object to the idea Bligh picks up a small sword without hesitation and matter of factly states, ""It would be a mistake to assume that I am no longer in command here.""The fascinating thing is that Bligh succeeded in taking the launch to Timor -- an amazing feat of seamanship and navigation, especially in light of the fact that all he had was a sextant and pocket watch; he had no charts or compass! It took them 47 days to sail 3618 miles with very few provisions on an incredibly overcrowded small craft. Although all of them survived the trip, five died in the ensuing days and months due to ailments sustained during the voyage. Unfortunately the film does not depict this incredible journey. Gibson's version does, however.This 1962 version also powerfully depicts Christian's depression after the mutiny. He locks himself up in his cabin while the rest of the crew parties it up on the mainland in Tahiti. He knows he can never go home again. This is a great, realisitic scene. Maimiti ultimately visits Fletcher in his cabin but can't shake him out of his depression; she angrily quotes a Tahitian proverb: ""You either eat life or life eats you!""Another positive aspect is that the picture at least reveals a little bit of what life promised the mutineers on Pitcairn; neither the '35 or '84 versions do this.WHAT DOESN'T WORK: Aside from the historical inaccuracies noted above, I see only two problems: Parts of the initial 10-minute dock sequence are stagey and dated, e.g. one man speaks, then another, etc. It comes off unreal and tempts the viewer to tune out before the story even gets started. The good thing is that it doesn't last long and once the voyage is underway the film utterly captivates.The other problem, as already noted, is that Bligh's brilliant trip to Timor in the launch is not depicted. I would have preferred to see at least a few scenes devoted to this incredible voyage.FINAL ANALYSIS: Despite the few historical inaccuracies, Brando's 1962 version is the most engaging version of the famous mutiny. This is definitely one of my all-time favorite films! I see it about once every two years and it never fails to capture my full attention. This is a sign of a really great film (yes, despite the fact that it inexplicably bombed when it was first released). Gibson's 1984 ""The Bounty"" is a worthy rendition as well; it's historically accurate but not as compelling. I recommend watching both films back to back, which is what I usually do.THE FATE OF THE MUTINEERS: There was ample land, water and food for the 9 mutineers, 6 Tahitian men and 11 women on Pitcairn. Christian naturally became the established leader of the colony and many children were born. Although Fletcher treated the Polynesian men fairly, other mutineers treated them like servants and relations deteriorated. When John Williams' wife died he took one of the Polynesian men's women as a ""replacement"" which naturally caused the natives to revolt. In the ensuing conflict five of the mutineers died, including Christian, and all 6 of the Tahitian men. Of the four remaining mutineers, one died in a drunken fall and Quintal was killed by the remaining two after a violent drunken fit of rage. Ned Young died of asthma in 1800, leaving John Adams, 9 women and 23 children to be discovered by an American vessel in 1808. Interestingly, John Adams (aka Alex Smith) had a bible from the ship and had became a devout Christian, along with Ned Young, during his years on the island, converting the native women and children and holding regular church services. Adams was ultimately granted amnesty by the British government for his part in the mutiny. Today the island is home to about 50 people from 9 families, most descendants of the mutineers, including Fletcher Christian; many adherents of Seventh-Day Adventism due to a successful Adventist mission in the 1890s.",5,The most captivating and compelling version of the mutiny on the Bounty story,1196380800,"11 30, 2007",2007,9326,"['were', 'two', 'early', 'Australian', 'films', 'addressing',
