627875,A3CJKTAXF2JT1,B00005JN99,Classic Movie Lady,"[1, 1]","Released by MGM in 1943 and directed by Edward Buzzell, ""Best Foot Forward"" was the screen adaptation of the highly successful Broadway musical/comedy of the same nameLucille Ball portrays herself in the film as a motion picture star, whose last few films didn't do very well at the box office.  She receives an invitation from a young fan, Bud Hooper (Tommy Dix), to be his date for the prom at his school, Winsocki Military Academy.  Convinced by her opportunistic manager that she needed the extra publicity, she accepts the invite.  Hooper tells his girlfriend and original prom date, Helen (Virginia Weidler) that he is sick in bed so Ball could be his date for the prom.  Problems and comedy ensues when Helen shows up at the school unexpectedly to care for her ""sick "" boyfriend.Although the plot is a bit flimsy, its the music and comedy that makes this film so enjoyable.  Ball is just wonderful, and it is a delight to see her interacting with her young costars while she brilliantly spoofs her own image.  Tommy Dix was in a number of films in the 1940s, but his powerful voice was not really used in this film until the last song of the movie.  Kenny Bowers was spot on as Hooper's hammy roommate,""Dutch"", as was William Gaxton as Ball's inept publicity agent.  A special mention goes to Chill Wills as a bumbling newspaper man.The young supporting women in this movie were absolutely wonderful.  June Allyson, Nancy Walker, and Gloria De Haven would all go on to be major stars.  Unfortunately, this would be the last movie for MGM stalwart, Virginia Weidler.  After growing up in front of the camera, Weidler was unable to successfully transition into more adult roles. After this film, she practically vanished into obscurity.Nancy Walker, who made a career out of self-depreciating humor, steals nearly every scene she is in.  Walker, DeHaven and Allyson team up for the show-stopping number, ""The Three Bs"", and are backed by Harry James and his orchestra.The musical score was written by songwriting team Hugh Martin and Ralph Blaine.  Although this was their first musical score for a film, it wouldn't be their last.  They also wrote the score for ""Meet Me In St Louis"".Although it is certainly not the best musical film in the MGM catalog, it most certainly was one of its most enthusiastic.  If you aren't looking for anything deep, and just want to have an hour or two of simple entertainment, this movie is worth a look.Trivia---The back lot and set used to film ""Best Foot Forward"" was also used to film the 1947 college musical, ""Good News"".Cast-Lucille Ball-----------Lucille BallElwood Bud Hooper------Tommy DixJack O'Reilly----------William GaxtonDutch------------------Kenny BowersHelen Schlessenger-----Virginia WeidlerNancy(The Blind Date)- Nancy WalkerMinerva----------------June AllysonEthel------------------Gloria DeHavenHunk-------------------Jack JordanMiss Delaware----------Beverly TylerChester Short----------Chill WillsMajor Reeber-----------Henry O'NeillMiss Talber------------Sara HadenCapt Bradd-------------Donald MacBrideCol Harkrider----------Morris AnkumMrs Dalyrimple---------Nana BryantHarry James and his Music Makers.",4,Best Foot Foward,1362182400,"03 2, 2013",2013,3170,"['Released', 'MGM', '1943', 'directed', 'Edward', 'Buzzell', 'Best', 'Foot', 'Forward', 'was', 'screen', 'adaptation', 'highly', 'successful', 'Broadway', 'musical/comedy', 'same', 'nameLucille', 'Ball', 'film', 'motion', 'picture', 'star', 'last', 'few', 'films', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'very', 'well', 'box', 'office', 'invitation', 'young', 'fan', 'Bud', 'Hooper', 'Tommy', 'Dix', 'be', 'date', 'prom', 'school', 'Winsocki', 'Military', 'Academy', 'Convinced', 'opportunistic', 'manager', 'needed', 'extra', 'publicity', 'invite', 'Hooper', 'girlfriend', 'original', 'prom', 'date', 'Helen', 'Virginia', 'Weidler', 'sick', 'bed', 'Ball', 'could', 'be', 'date', 'prom', 'Problems', 'comedy', 'ensues', 'when', 'Helen', 'up', 'school', 'unexpectedly', 'care', 'sick', 'plot', 'bit', 'flimsy', 'music', 'comedy', 'film', 'so', 'enjoyable', 'Ball', 'just', 'wonderful', 'delight', 'see', 'interacting', 'young', 'costars', 'brilliantly', 'spoofs', 'own', 'image', 'Tommy', 'Dix', 'was', 'number', 'films', '1940s', 'powerful', 'voice', 'was', 'not', 'really', 'used', 'film', 'last', 'song', 'movie', 'Kenny', 'Bowers', 'was', 'spot', 'Hooper', 'hammy', 'roommate', 'Dutch', 'was', 'William', 'Gaxton', 'Ball', 'inept', 'publicity', 'agent', 'special', 'mention', 'Chill', 'Wills', 'bumbling', 'newspaper', 'man.The', 'young', 'supporting', 'women', 'movie', 'were', 'absolutely', 'wonderful', 'June', 'Allyson', 'Nancy', 'Walker', 'Gloria', 'De', 'Haven', 'would', 'go', 'be', 'major', 'stars', 'Unfortunately', 'would', 'be', 'last', 'movie', 'MGM', 'stalwart', 'Virginia', 'Weidler', 'growing', 'up', 'front', 'camera', 'Weidler', 'was', 'unable', 'successfully', 'transition', 'more', 'adult', 'roles', 'film', 'practically', 'vanished', 'obscurity.Nancy', 'Walker', 'who', 'made', 'career', 'self-depreciating', 'humor', 'steals', 'nearly', 'scene', 'Walker', 'DeHaven', 'Allyson', 'team', 'up', 'show-stopping', 'number', 'Three', 'Bs', 'are', 'backed', 'Harry', 'James', 'orchestra.The', 'musical', 'score', 'was', 'written', 'songwriting', 'team', 'Hugh', 'Martin', 'Ralph', 'Blaine', 'was', 'first', 'musical', 'score', 'film', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'last', 'also', 'wrote', 'score', 'Meet', 'Me', 'St', 'Louis', 'certainly', 'not', 'best', 'musical', 'film', 'MGM', 'catalog', 'most', 'certainly', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'enthusiastic', 'are', ""n't"", 'looking', 'anything', 'deep', 'just', 'want', 'have', 'hour', 'two', 'simple', 'entertainment', 'movie', 'look.Trivia', '-The', 'back', 'lot', 'set', 'used', 'film', 'Best', 'Foot', 'Forward', 'was', 'also', 'used', 'film', '1947', 'college', 'musical', 'Good', 'News', '.Cast-Lucille', 'Ball', '-Lucille', 'BallElwood', 'Bud', 'Hooper', 'Tommy', 'DixJack', ""O'Reilly"", 'William', 'GaxtonDutch', 'Kenny', 'BowersHelen', 'Schlessenger', '-Virginia', 'WeidlerNancy', 'Blind', 'Date', 'Nancy', 'WalkerMinerva', 'June', 'AllysonEthel', 'Gloria', 'DeHavenHunk', '-Jack', 'JordanMiss', 'Delaware', 'Beverly', 'TylerChester', 'Short', 'Chill', 'WillsMajor', 'Reeber', '-Henry', ""O'NeillMiss"", 'Talber', 'Sara', 'HadenCapt', 'Bradd', '-Donald', 'MacBrideCol', 'Harkrider', 'Morris', 'AnkumMrs', 'Dalyrimple', '-Nana', 'BryantHarry', 'James', 'Music', 'Makers']",N/A
627876,A2GCHG6U8HTVIT,B00005JN99,C. O. DeRiemer,"[20, 20]","Best Foot Forward was a successful 1941 Broadway musical and, like Too Many Girls, was bought and adapted to be a vehicle for Lucille Ball. Like Too Many Girls, it's a simple-minded school romp where the innocence of the students and administrators makes today's educational establishments look like Sodom and Gomorra. We're at Winsocki Military Academy and the big prom is almost here. Cadet Bud Hooper (Tommy Dix) had written a fan letter to Hollywood star Lucille Ball asking if she'd be his date. He wasn't expecting she'd agree, but then he didn't know her press agent, Jack O'Reilly (William Gaxton). Seems Lucille's last couple of pictures hadn't done too well so he convinces her it would be great publicity for her to go to the prom. Bud is floored. His two roommates, Dutch (Kenny Bowers) and ""Hunk"" (Jack Jordan), immediately start making plans to meet her. And then Bud remembers his girl friend, Helen. Well, he tells Helen he's got the grippe, but after Lucille (and all the other cadets' dates) shows up, so does Helen...to keep him company because he's sick. The dance is about to start, Lucille is waiting for Bud...and Bud finds out Helen is on campus looking for him. Now we're in a whirl of misunderstandings, miscues, schemes and subterfuges, all powered by Hugh Martin's and Ralph Blane's songs, by Harry James and His Music Makers swinging at the prom, by broad performances from the cadets and their dates and by relentless enthusiasm and good cheer.Among the standouts in the movie is Lucille Ball playing herself. Not only is she gorgeous, she handles the comedy with aplomb, which includes making some gentle but sharp fun of herself as a movie star. William Gaxton as her agent is amusing, conniving and does no lasting damage to anyone. The two of them bring polished comic performances to the movie. June Allyson and Nancy Walker recreate their stage roles and do fine jobs. With Gloria DeHaven, they are a smash singing ""The Three Bs,"" with Harry James backing them. That's the Three Bs as in barrelhouse, boogie and the blues. The script is amusing and corny. ""Is it true,"" asks Bud, ""that everyone in California sleeps under two blankets?"" Answers O'Reilly, ""No. How could all those people get under just two blankets?"" The young men -- boys, actually -- playing the cadets bring a lot of unabashed enthusiasm to their parts. Somewhere in the crowd is an unbilled Stanley Donen. Kenny Bowers can be funny but the director should have had him tone down the mugging. Tommy Dix comes up to Lucille Ball's shoulders, has a baby face and a kind of eery young-Mickey-Rooney sincerity. He also has a big, polished baritone voice. Dix handles his part well and, at the conclusion, power-sings the big production number, ""Buckle Down Winsocki,"" while all the cadets and their dates march around the field during graduation. You'll enjoy the movie best if you just sit back and not be too critical.This was Hugh Martin's and Ralph Blane's first score. Except for ""Winsocki,"" none of the songs became well-known. Still, they have style and spirit. ""Three Men on a Date,"" ""The Three Bs"" and ""Ev'ry Time"" I thought held up well over more than 60 years. On the strength of this score, Martin and Blane were offered the assignment of writing the songs for Meet Me in St. Louis, and that put them on the map. I don't think they ever topped ""The Boy Next Door,"" ""The Trolley Song"" and ""Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas.""If you like college musicals (although I suppose Best Foot Forward is really a prep-school musical), this one has enthusiasm and a fine performance by Lucille Ball. I'd also take a look at Too Many Girls (1940), also with Ball and with an outstanding Rodgers & Hart score, and Good News (1947), with a charming performance, this time as the lead, by June Allyson.The DVD transfer is just fine. The movie was shot in Technicolor and looks lush and rich. There are a couple of extras. The best is one of the 20-minute shorts dancer Hal LeRoy cranked out during the Thirties. This one is titled The Knight Is Young (1938). It's the story of a tap-dancing sign painter (LeRoy) and the girl he falls for (June Allyson). I wish someone would gather together all of his short features, clean them up and then issue them on one DVD. Hal LeRoy was an immensely talented tapper. He was a gangly, kind of goofy-looking guy with long legs. He was fast with his feet and had a lot of style. At times LeRoy could convince you his knees and ankles were double-jointed.",4,Sit back and don't be too critical...and I think you'll enjoy this enthusiastic college musical,1167523200,"12 31, 2006",2006,4495,"['Best', 'Foot', 'Forward', 'was', 'successful', '1941', 'Broadway', 'musical', 'Too', 'Many', 'Girls', 'was', 'bought', 'adapted', 'be', 'vehicle', 'Lucille', 'Ball', 'Too', 'Many', 'Girls', 'simple-minded', 'school', 'romp', 'where', 'innocence', 'students', 'administrators', 'today', 'educational', 'establishments', 'look', 'Sodom', 'Gomorra', ""'re"", 'Winsocki', 'Military', 'Academy', 'big', 'prom', 'almost', 'here', 'Cadet', 'Bud', 'Hooper', 'Tommy', 'Dix', 'had', 'written', 'fan', 'letter', 'Hollywood', 'star', 'Lucille', 'Ball', 'asking', ""'d"", 'be', 'date', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', ""'d"", 'agree', 'then', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'press', 'agent', 'Jack', ""O'Reilly"", 'William', 'Gaxton', 'Seems', 'Lucille', 'last', 'couple', 'pictures', 'had', ""n't"", 'done', 'too', 'well', 'so', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'publicity', 'go', 'prom', 'Bud', 'floored', 'two', 'roommates', 'Dutch', 'Kenny', 'Bowers', 'Hunk', 'Jack', 'Jordan', 'immediately', 'start', 'making', 'plans', 'meet', 'then', 'Bud', 'girl', 'friend', 'Helen', 'Well', 'Helen', 'got', 'grippe', 'Lucille', 'other', 'cadets', 'dates', 'up', 'so', 'Helen', 'keep', 'company', 'sick', 'dance', 'start', 'Lucille', 'waiting', 'Bud', 'Bud', 'out', 'Helen', 'campus', 'looking', 'Now', ""'re"", 'whirl', 'misunderstandings', 'miscues', 'schemes', 'subterfuges', 'powered', 'Hugh', 'Martin', 'Ralph', 'Blane', 'songs', 'Harry', 'James', 'Music', 'Makers', 'swinging', 'prom', 'broad', 'performances', 'cadets', 'dates', 'relentless', 'enthusiasm', 'good', 'cheer.Among', 'standouts', 'movie', 'Lucille', 'Ball', 'playing', 'Not', 'only', 'gorgeous', 'comedy', 'aplomb', 'making', 'gentle', 'sharp', 'fun', 'movie', 'star', 'William', 'Gaxton', 'agent', 'amusing', 'conniving', 'lasting', 'damage', 'anyone', 'two', 'bring', 'polished', 'comic', 'performances', 'movie', 'June', 'Allyson', 'Nancy', 'Walker', 'recreate', 'stage', 'roles', 'do', 'fine', 'jobs', 'Gloria', 'DeHaven', 'are', 'smash', 'singing', 'Three', 'Bs', 'Harry', 'James', 'backing', 'Three', 'Bs', 'barrelhouse', 'boogie', 'blues', 'script', 'amusing', 'corny', 'true', 'Bud', 'everyone', 'California', 'sleeps', 'two', 'blankets', 'Answers', ""O'Reilly"", 'No', 'How', 'could', 'all', 'people', 'get', 'just', 'two', 'blankets', 'young', 'men', 'boys', 'actually', 'playing', 'cadets', 'bring', 'lot', 'unabashed', 'enthusiasm', 'parts', 'Somewhere', 'crowd', 'unbilled', 'Stanley', 'Donen', 'Kenny', 'Bowers', 'can', 'be', 'funny', 'director', 'should', 'have', 'had', 'tone', 'down', 'mugging', 'Tommy', 'Dix', 'up', 'Lucille', 'Ball', 'shoulders', 'baby', 'face', 'kind', 'eery', 'young-Mickey-Rooney', 'sincerity', 'also', 'big', 'polished', 'baritone', 'voice', 'Dix', 'part', 'well', 'conclusion', 'power-sings', 'big', 'production', 'number', 'Buckle', 'Down', 'Winsocki', 'cadets', 'dates', 'march', 'field', 'graduation', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'movie', 'best', 'just', 'sit', 'back', 'not', 'be', 'too', 'critical.This', 'was', 'Hugh', 'Martin', 'Ralph', 'Blane', 'first', 'score', 'Winsocki', 'none', 'songs', 'became', 'well-known', 'Still', 'have', 'style', 'spirit', 'Three', 'Men', 'Date', 'Three', 'Bs', ""Ev'ry"", 'Time', 'thought', 'held', 'up', 'well', 'more', '60', 'years', 'strength', 'score', 'Martin', 'Blane', 'were', 'offered', 'assignment', 'writing', 'songs', 'Meet', 'Me', 'St.', 'Louis', 'put', 'map', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'ever', 'topped', 'Boy', 'Next', 'Door', 'Trolley', 'Song', 'Have', 'Merry', 'Little', 'Christmas', 'like', 'college', 'musicals', 'suppose', 'Best', 'Foot', 'Forward', 'really', 'prep-school', 'musical', 'one', 'enthusiasm', 'fine', 'performance', 'Lucille', 'Ball', ""'d"", 'also', 'take', 'look', 'Too', 'Many', 'Girls', '1940', 'also', 'Ball', 'outstanding', 'Rodgers', 'Hart', 'score', 'Good', 'News', '1947', 'charming', 'performance', 'time', 'lead', 'June', 'Allyson.The', 'DVD', 'transfer', 'just', 'fine', 'movie', 'was', 'shot', 'Technicolor', 'lush', 'rich', 'are', 'couple', 'extras', 'best', 'one', '20-minute', 'shorts', 'dancer', 'Hal', 'LeRoy', 'cranked', 'out', 'Thirties', 'one', 'titled', 'Knight', 'Is', 'Young', '1938', 'story', 'tap-dancing', 'sign', 'painter', 'LeRoy', 'girl', 'June', 'Allyson', 'wish', 'someone', 'would', 'gather', 'together', 'short', 'features', 'clean', 'up', 'then', 'issue', 'one', 'DVD', 'Hal', 'LeRoy', 'was', 'immensely', 'talented', 'tapper', 'was', 'gangly', 'kind', 'goofy-looking', 'guy', 'long', 'legs', 'was', 'fast', 'feet', 'had', 'lot', 'style', 'times', 'LeRoy', 'could', 'convince', 'knees', 'ankles', 'were', 'double-jointed']",N/A

In BEST FOOT FORWARD she plays a Hollywood INSIDER, an established actress--admittedly one in a bit of a box office slump and eager for some effective publicity.  And interestingly enough, she plays an actress named ""Lucille Ball""--or as the credits would have it, she is ""by herself.""At first blush, it would seem perhaps a little, well, unusual for an established film actress to be playing ""box office poison"" under her own name.  Had she called herself ""Lola Beck"" or ""Linda Blaine"" in the film, it still might have been clear that her character was based on Lucille Ball, without having to admit, even jokingly, that she had experienced a a few box office bombs in recent years.  But then maybe I'm not giving the audiences of the 1940s enough credit.  They probably ""got"" the joke just fine and enjoyed seeing the ""Queen of the B's"" play ""herself"" in an obviously farcical context.The PR stunt Lucy gets involved in--on the advice of her agent--is to accept the invitation of a young fan at a Winsocki Military Academy to be his date for the ""prom.""  She's expecting a lot of attention, but Bud Hooper (Tommy Dix), the young cadet who extended the invitation, never actually expected her to take him up on the offer, and has already made plans to attend with his own best gal Helen (Virginia Weidler).  Of course, all kinds of mix-ups and highjinks ensue--not the least of which is that Bud and his friends concoct a scheme to have Ball attend the ball under Helen's name (not her own).  Hmm, some publicity scheme that is!The boys also conspire to keep the glamorous actress OFF the dancefloor, lest all the young wolves in the ""stagline"" (or was it ""stags in the wolfline""?) try to horn in.  As you might expect, the real Helen does show up on campus to nobly nurse young Hooper, who had given her the time honored excuse that he had the ""grippe,"" and the anticipatedcomplications ensue.  Lucy's agent creates further confusion by sneaking into the ball, dressed as a waiter.  All vintage farcical fare, some of which may fall a little flat for 21st century viewers and some of which will still raise a chuckle or two.The musical numbers are lively and feature talented young performers who would go on to make their mark in musical film history.  June Allyson is on board, as is Gloria DeHaven and a sharply comic Nancy Walker. And of course, the Harry James Orchestra is on hand to provide the musical entertainment for the Winsocki Military Academy Prom (well, why not?).  Like so many wartime films, it ends with the boys being forgiven for their antics and a strong dose of patriotic fervor during the final graduation scene (as the boys ready themselves for the next stage of their military careers and an American flag is superimposed over the closing credits).BEST FOOT FORWARD is definitely of its era.  As a period piece, it's certainly of interest.  It's scarcely a ""classic musical,"" but it's certainly enjoyable.  Although there's more emphasis placed on Lucy's status as a glamour girl, the comic timing that would make her a television legend is already on display.",4,They Love LUCILLE!,1200096000,"01 12, 2008",2008,3274,"['fondest', 'memories', 'Lucille', 'Ball', 'are', 'zany', 'TV', 'sitcom', 'housewife', 'doing', 'darndest', 'BREAK', 'INTO', 'show', 'biz', 'might', '1943', 'screen', 'musical', 'interesting', 'contrast', 'BEST', 'FOOT', 'FORWARD', 'Hollywood', 'INSIDER', 'established', 'actress', 'admittedly', 'one', 'bit', 'box', 'office', 'slump', 'eager', 'effective', 'publicity', 'interestingly', 'enough', 'actress', 'named', 'Lucille', 'Ball', 'credits', 'would', 'have', 'first', 'blush', 'would', 'seem', 'perhaps', 'little', 'well', 'unusual', 'established', 'film', 'actress', 'be', 'playing', 'box', 'office', 'poison', 'own', 'name', 'Had', 'called', 'Lola', 'Beck', 'Linda', 'Blaine', 'film', 'still', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'clear', 'character', 'was', 'based', 'Lucille', 'Ball', 'having', 'admit', 'even', 'jokingly', 'had', 'experienced', 'few', 'box', 'office', 'bombs', 'recent', 'years', 'then', 'maybe', ""'m"", 'not', 'giving', 'audiences', '1940s', 'enough', 'credit', 'probably', 'got', 'joke', 'just', 'fine', 'enjoyed', 'seeing', 'Queen', 'B', 'play', 'obviously', 'farcical', 'context.The', 'PR', 'stunt', 'Lucy', 'involved', 'advice', 'agent', 'accept', 'invitation', 'young', 'fan', 'Winsocki', 'Military', 'Academy', 'be', 'date', 'prom', 'expecting', 'lot', 'attention', 'Bud', 'Hooper', 'Tommy', 'Dix', 'young', 'cadet', 'who', 'extended', 'invitation', 'never', 'actually', 'expected', 'take', 'up', 'offer', 'already', 'made', 'plans', 'attend', 'own', 'best', 'gal', 'Helen', 'Virginia', 'Weidler', 'course', 'kinds', 'mix-ups', 'highjinks', 'ensue', 'not', 'least', 'Bud', 'friends', 'concoct', 'scheme', 'have', 'Ball', 'attend', 'ball', 'Helen', 'name', 'not', 'own', 'Hmm', 'publicity', 'scheme', 'boys', 'also', 'conspire', 'keep', 'glamorous', 'actress', 'dancefloor', 'lest', 'young', 'wolves', 'stagline', 'was', 'stags', 'wolfline', 'try', 'horn', 'might', 'expect', 'real', 'Helen', 'show', 'up', 'campus', 'nobly', 'nurse', 'young', 'Hooper', 'who', 'had', 'given', 'time', 'honored', 'excuse', 'had', 'grippe', 'anticipatedcomplications', 'ensue', 'Lucy', 'agent', 'further', 'confusion', 'sneaking', 'ball', 'dressed', 'waiter', 'vintage', 'farcical', 'fare', 'may', 'fall', 'little', 'flat', '21st', 'century', 'viewers', 'will', 'still', 'raise', 'chuckle', 'two.The', 'musical', 'numbers', 'are', 'lively', 'feature', 'talented', 'young', 'performers', 'who', 'would', 'go', 'make', 'mark', 'musical', 'film', 'history', 'June', 'Allyson', 'board', 'Gloria', 'DeHaven', 'sharply', 'comic', 'Nancy', 'Walker', 'course', 'Harry', 'James', 'Orchestra', 'hand', 'provide', 'musical', 'entertainment', 'Winsocki', 'Military', 'Academy', 'Prom', 'well', 'why', 'not', 'so', 'many', 'wartime', 'films', 'boys', 'being', 'forgiven', 'antics', 'strong', 'dose', 'patriotic', 'fervor', 'final', 'graduation', 'scene', 'boys', 'ready', 'next', 'stage', 'military', 'careers', 'American', 'flag', 'superimposed', 'closing', 'credits', '.BEST', 'FOOT', 'FORWARD', 'definitely', 'era', 'period', 'piece', 'certainly', 'interest', 'scarcely', 'classic', 'musical', 'certainly', 'enjoyable', 'more', 'emphasis', 'placed', 'Lucy', 'status', 'glamour', 'girl', 'comic', 'timing', 'would', 'make', 'television', 'legend', 'already', 'display']",N/A

627882,A2R6RA8FRBS608,B00005JN99,Matthew G. Sherwin,"[1, 1]","Best Foot Forward is an excellent MGM movie with laughs, action and musical numbers that pack a punch! There's Harry James & His Orchestra; Lucille Ball, Nancy Walker in her film debut, June Allyson and more. The plot moves along at a very good pace and with the musical numbers you won't be bored. The cinematography is excellent and I was particularly impressed with the choreography; the scenes in which they have the senior prom are superlative. The other casting worked well, too.When the action starts, we quickly meet young Bud Hooper (Tommy Dix) who's in a bit of trouble, to say the least. He has written a fan letter to Lucille Ball; and unbeknownst to him and the others at Winsocki Military Academy, Lucille Ball's luck in films has turned so sour that she is actually headed to Bud's senior prom to be his date--and get some publicity to win back her Hollywood fame and fortune. Trouble is, however, that Bud's girlfriend Helen Schlesinger (Virginia Weidler) is coming to be with Bud because he told her he had the flu--so that she would stay away! Lots of problems start to happen real fast when Helen arrives unexpectedly at Bud's school and she sees that Bud is perfectly fine--and going with Lucille Ball as his date to the senior prom.If that isn't enough to get some action going, there's also the issue that Bud needs Lucille to go by his girlfriend's name Helen; before Bud knew Lucille was really coming he told his school that Helen would in fact be his date for the prom. Lucille isn't happy about this but with a little bit of prodding, partly from her agent Jack O'Riley (William Gaxton), she decides to play along and hopes that she'll get some good publicity at the prom with Bud and his two other roommates Hunk (Jack Jordan) and ""Dutch"" Miller (Kenny Bowers). We also meet Nancy (Nancy Walker) who plays a young girl on a blind date to help her father's potential business deal, but when Nancy sees her date ""Greenie"" (Bob Stebbins) she's not exactly happy, either.The musical numbers are excellent. We get Harry James & His Orchestra playing swing music and more of the day an there's even a brief version of ""Flight of the Bumble Bee."" Look also for Nancy, Ethel (June Allyson) and Minerva (Gloria DeHaven) to sing a grand tune called ""The Three Bs.""Of course, the plot can go anywhere from here. When Helen shows up at the prom and sees Bud dancing with Lucille, she starts a ""souvenir collecting"" riot that results in Lucille's dress being torn off to leave Lucille standing there in her slip! Will Helen ever be able to forgive Bud? What about the school officials including Major Reeber (Henry O'Neill) and Captain Bradd (Donald MacBride)--how will they discipline Bud or otherwise handle this situation? And will Nancy find love? No plot spoilers here, folks--watch and find out!The DVD has an extra entitled The Knight Is Young; this is quite good. In addition, there's a cartoon entitled One Ham's Family.Best Foot Forward is quite funny and the musical numbers along with the plot are excellent. I highly recommend this film for people who enjoy classic movie musicals; and fans of the great Lucille Ball will not be disappointed.",5,it's enough to make me think that hell has no woman like a fury scorned,1248134400,"07 21, 2009",2009,3170,"['Best', 'Foot', 'Forward', 'excellent', 'MGM', 'movie', 'laughs', 'action', 'musical', 'numbers', 'pack', 'punch', 'Harry', 'James', 'Orchestra', 'Lucille', 'Ball', 'Nancy', 'Walker', 'film', 'debut', 'June', 'Allyson', 'more', 'plot', 'along', 'very', 'good', 'pace', 'musical', 'numbers', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'bored', 'cinematography', 'excellent', 'was', 'particularly', 'impressed', 'choreography', 'scenes', 'have', 'senior', 'prom', 'are', 'superlative', 'other', 'casting', 'worked', 'well', 'too.When', 'action', 'quickly', 'meet', 'young', 'Bud', 'Hooper', 'Tommy', 'Dix', 'who', 'bit', 'trouble', 'say', 'least', 'written', 'fan', 'letter', 'Lucille', 'Ball', 'unbeknownst', 'others', 'Winsocki', 'Military', 'Academy', 'Lucille', 'Ball', 'luck', 'films', 'turned', 'so', 'sour', 'actually', 'headed', 'Bud', 'senior', 'prom', 'be', 'date', 'get', 'publicity', 'win', 'back', 'Hollywood', 'fame', 'fortune', 'Trouble', 'however', 'Bud', 'girlfriend', 'Helen', 'Schlesinger', 'Virginia', 'Weidler', 'coming', 'be', 'Bud', 'told', 'had', 'flu', 'would', 'stay', 'away', 'Lots', 'problems', 'start', 'happen', 'real', 'fast', 'when', 'Helen', 'unexpectedly', 'Bud', 'school', 'Bud', 'perfectly', 'fine', 'going', 'Lucille', 'Ball', 'date', 'senior', 'prom.If', ""n't"", 'enough', 'get', 'action', 'going', 'also', 'issue', 'Bud', 'Lucille', 'go', 'girlfriend', 'name', 'Helen', 'Bud', 'knew', 'Lucille', 'was', 'really', 'coming', 'told', 'school', 'Helen', 'would', 'fact', 'be', 'date', 'prom', 'Lucille', ""n't"", 'happy', 'little', 'bit', 'prodding', 'partly', 'agent', 'Jack', ""O'Riley"", 'William', 'Gaxton', 'play', 'along', ""'ll"", 'get', 'good', 'publicity', 'prom', 'Bud', 'two', 'other', 'roommates', 'Hunk', 'Jack', 'Jordan', 'Dutch', 'Miller', 'Kenny', 'Bowers', 'also', 'meet', 'Nancy', 'Nancy', 'Walker', 'who', 'young', 'girl', 'blind', 'date', 'help', 'father', 'potential', 'business', 'deal', 'when', 'Nancy', 'date', 'Greenie', 'Bob', 'Stebbins', 'not', 'exactly', 'happy', 'either.The', 'musical', 'numbers', 'are', 'excellent', 'get', 'Harry', 'James', 'Orchestra', 'playing', 'swing', 'music', 'more', 'day', 'even', 'brief', 'version', 'Flight', 'Bumble', 'Bee', 'Look', 'also', 'Nancy', 'Ethel', 'June', 'Allyson', 'Minerva', 'Gloria', 'DeHaven', 'sing', 'grand', 'tune', 'called', 'Three', 'Bs', 'course', 'plot', 'can', 'go', 'anywhere', 'here', 'When', 'Helen', 'up', 'prom', 'sees', 'Bud', 'dancing', 'Lucille', 'souvenir', 'collecting', 'riot', 'results', 'Lucille', 'dress', 'being', 'torn', 'off', 'leave', 'Lucille', 'standing', 'there', 'slip', 'Will', 'Helen', 'ever', 'be', 'able', 'forgive', 'Bud', 'What', 'school', 'officials', 'including', 'Major', 'Reeber', 'Henry', ""O'Neill"", 'Captain', 'Bradd', 'Donald', 'MacBride', 'how', 'will', 'discipline', 'Bud', 'otherwise', 'handle', 'situation', 'will', 'Nancy', 'find', 'love', 'plot', 'spoilers', 'here', 'folks', 'watch', 'find', 'out', 'DVD', 'extra', 'entitled', 'Knight', 'Is', 'Young', 'quite', 'good', 'addition', 'cartoon', 'entitled', 'One', 'Ham', 'Family.Best', 'Foot', 'Forward', 'quite', 'funny', 'musical', 'numbers', 'plot', 'are', 'excellent', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'people', 'who', 'enjoy', 'classic', 'movie', 'musicals', 'fans', 'great', 'Lucille', 'Ball', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'disappointed']",N/A
627883,A11LWFD867TD3R,B00005JN99,"Pamela Fuschetto ""Amazon Fan""","[2, 2]","I just finished watching Best Foot Forward for the first time.  Being a staunch classic movie fan, the talent is so superior to anything we have today, I don't know how I missed this one; but I won't miss it again as I had to purchase a copy on the spot.TALENT,TALENT, AND MORE TALENT.  That about sums this movie up.  The plot is predictable, the story light but FUN, FUN, FUN.  Lucy is great in what I can only assume is an accurate portrayal of herself.  The supporting cast outstanding.  Most reprising their Broadway roles.But what blew my mind was Tommy Dix!!  I did not know of him before I saw him today and could not believe his voice.  Sixteen and seventeen performing this roll on Broadway and eighteen for the movie.  Unbelievable!!  So amazing that I thought it had to be dubbed and was so thrilled to learn that it is indeed his voice.  I would have been standing in the aisles cheering his rousing rendition of Winsocki had I had the good fortune to see him perform it on Broadway.  And it is obvious by the smile on his face in the movie, that he enjoys performing this number. Thank goodness it is on film to cherish and enjoy over and over again. It is rare that an actor gives one performance that leaves people with such a long lasting impression.  Tommy Dix is that rare actor, and his Winsocki that one in a million performance.Along with Micky Rooney's movies you could class this as one of the original High School Musicals.  The cadets at Winsocki Military Academy having their Senior Prom and Graduation with aspirations for acceptance to West Point the University.  What I found most enjoyable is that with few exceptions, June Allyson was 25 and Lucy 32 at the time of shooting, the student cast was indeed in their teens and high school age.  Not like today when the ""teen"" for the most part is well into their 20's.  Just another documentation of the talent in that era of film making.So give yourself a real treat and watch this movie as soon as you can.  It will no doubt leave you with a big smile on your face too.  Enjoy, its a real treasure.",5,STAND UP AND CHEER!!!!!,1215129600,"07 4, 2008",2008,2077,"['just', 'finished', 'watching', 'Best', 'Foot', 'Forward', 'first', 'time', 'Being', 'staunch', 'classic', 'movie', 'fan', 'talent', 'so', 'superior', 'anything', 'have', 'today', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'missed', 'one', 'wo', ""n't"", 'miss', 'again', 'had', 'purchase', 'copy', 'spot.TALENT', 'TALENT', 'AND', 'MORE', 'TALENT', 'sums', 'movie', 'up', 'plot', 'predictable', 'story', 'light', 'FUN', 'FUN', 'FUN', 'Lucy', 'great', 'what', 'can', 'only', 'assume', 'accurate', 'portrayal', 'herself', 'supporting', 'cast', 'outstanding', 'Most', 'reprising', 'Broadway', 'roles.But', 'what', 'blew', 'mind', 'was', 'Tommy', 'Dix', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'saw', 'today', 'could', 'not', 'believe', 'voice', 'Sixteen', 'seventeen', 'performing', 'roll', 'Broadway', 'eighteen', 'movie', 'Unbelievable', 'So', 'amazing', 'thought', 'had', 'be', 'dubbed', 'was', 'so', 'thrilled', 'learn', 'indeed', 'voice', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'standing', 'aisles', 'cheering', 'rousing', 'rendition', 'Winsocki', 'had', 'had', 'good', 'fortune', 'see', 'perform', 'Broadway', 'obvious', 'smile', 'face', 'movie', 'performing', 'number', 'Thank', 'goodness', 'film', 'cherish', 'enjoy', 'over', 'again', 'rare', 'actor', 'one', 'performance', 'people', 'long', 'lasting', 'impression', 'Tommy', 'Dix', 'rare', 'actor', 'Winsocki', 'one', 'million', 'performance.Along', 'Micky', 'Rooney', 'movies', 'could', 'class', 'one', 'original', 'High', 'School', 'Musicals', 'cadets', 'Winsocki', 'Military', 'Academy', 'having', 'Senior', 'Prom', 'Graduation', 'aspirations', 'acceptance', 'West', 'Point', 'University', 'What', 'found', 'most', 'enjoyable', 'few', 'exceptions', 'June', 'Allyson', 'was', '25', 'Lucy', '32', 'time', 'shooting', 'student', 'cast', 'was', 'indeed', 'teens', 'high', 'school', 'age', 'Not', 'today', 'when', 'teen', 'most', 'part', 'well', '20', 'Just', 'documentation', 'talent', 'era', 'film', 'making.So', 'give', 'real', 'treat', 'watch', 'movie', 'as', 'soon', 'can', 'will', 'doubt', 'leave', 'big', 'smile', 'face', 'too', 'Enjoy', 'real', 'treasure']",N/A

And she's only there at her managers' insistence,to get publicity! His girlfriend eventually finds out,and boy falls out with girl,mayhem ensues but alls well that ends well.The plot is nothing special and the script could/should have been much better.Instead alot of the lines are plain,trite and miss the mark much too often.Lucille Ball unfortunately gives her best but just isn't given enough of signifigance to say or do.However there are two elements that save the movie.The first is Nancy Walker who does a terrific turn as a smart alecky debutante.She provides the film with the majority of its' laughs.The second is Harry James.I have always considered him to be the greatest trumpet player of the 20th century and this movie provides more than ample proof,and all within two numbers.The first is ""Two O'Clock Jump"",one of his big hits and a real great jump tune.The second is ""Flight of the Bumblebee"".There are no adjectives that I could use to adequately describe the fingerwork and technique on this number.It was astonishing to watch in /43 and is STILL a wonder to this day.He even does a duet dance number with Nancy Walker.And all this in colour!And speaking of colour.This print generally is very good.There are a couple of short cut scenes that appear a little out of focus but other than that it looks like it was filmed yesterday.To recap; Best Foot Forward while ""OSCAR caliber"" is NOT one of its' attributes,and while it is a film very much of its' time,it is still a very plesant diversion.It is in crisp colour and Lucille Ball fans will find a nice spot for it in their library I'm sure.Also to watch out for is a young Gloria De Haven and June Allyson.Nancy Walker is the comic standout and Harry James rounds things out beautifully in the music department with his peerless horn playing.I might also add that the soundtrack is still available,but not for long.It is made by Rhino records in a very limited addition CD.Only 2500 copies have been pressed in all so may I suggest if you like the numbers in this movie you will love the CD also.",3,A nice trip back to the musical 40s,1190937600,"09 28, 2007",2007,2788,"['Best', 'Foot', 'Forward', 'pleasant', 'diversion', 'watch', 'even', 'still', 'today.It', 'was', 'originally', 'successful', 'Broadway', 'play', 'MGM', 'got', 'rights', 'filmed', 'colour.The', 'movie', 'was', 'definitely', 'aimed', 'teenage', 'audience', 'inspire', 'get', 'military', 'swing', 'things', 'might', 'say.It', 'concerns', 'three', 'young', 'cadet', 'sergeants', 'girls.There', 'up', 'coming', 'neighbouring', 'girls', 'school', 'one', 'sergeants', 'written', 'Lucille', 'Ball', 'who', 'unexpectedly', 'accepted', 'invitation', 'attend', 'prom', 'him.Now', 'task', 'trying', 'keep', 'girl', 'finding', 'out', 'attending', 'prom.To', 'top', 'things', 'Lucille', 'Ball', 'due', 'academy', 'rules', 'can', 'only', 'go', 'girlfriends', 'name', 'only', 'there', 'managers', 'insistence', 'get', 'publicity', 'girlfriend', 'eventually', 'out', 'boy', 'out', 'girl', 'mayhem', 'ensues', 'alls', 'well', 'well.The', 'plot', 'nothing', 'special', 'script', 'could/should', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better.Instead', 'alot', 'lines', 'are', 'plain', 'trite', 'miss', 'mark', 'much', 'too', 'often.Lucille', 'Ball', 'unfortunately', 'best', 'just', ""n't"", 'given', 'enough', 'signifigance', 'say', 'do.However', 'are', 'two', 'elements', 'save', 'movie.The', 'first', 'Nancy', 'Walker', 'who', 'terrific', 'turn', 'smart', 'alecky', 'debutante.She', 'film', 'majority', 'laughs.The', 'second', 'Harry', 'James.I', 'have', 'always', 'considered', 'be', 'greatest', 'trumpet', 'player', '20th', 'century', 'movie', 'more', 'ample', 'proof', 'two', 'numbers.The', 'first', 'Two', ""O'Clock"", 'Jump', 'one', 'big', 'hits', 'real', 'great', 'jump', 'tune.The', 'second', 'Flight', 'Bumblebee', 'are', 'adjectives', 'could', 'use', 'adequately', 'describe', 'fingerwork', 'technique', 'number.It', 'was', 'astonishing', 'watch', '/43', 'STILL', 'wonder', 'day.He', 'even', 'duet', 'dance', 'number', 'Nancy', 'Walker.And', 'colour', 'speaking', 'colour.This', 'print', 'generally', 'very', 'good.There', 'are', 'couple', 'short', 'cut', 'scenes', 'appear', 'little', 'focus', 'other', 'was', 'filmed', 'yesterday.To', 'recap', 'Best', 'Foot', 'Forward', 'OSCAR', 'caliber', 'NOT', 'one', 'attributes', 'film', 'very', 'much', 'time', 'still', 'very', 'plesant', 'diversion.It', 'crisp', 'colour', 'Lucille', 'Ball', 'fans', 'will', 'find', 'nice', 'spot', 'library', ""'m"", 'sure.Also', 'watch', 'out', 'young', 'Gloria', 'De', 'Haven', 'June', 'Allyson.Nancy', 'Walker', 'comic', 'standout', 'Harry', 'James', 'things', 'out', 'beautifully', 'music', 'department', 'peerless', 'horn', 'playing.I', 'might', 'also', 'add', 'soundtrack', 'still', 'available', 'not', 'long.It', 'made', 'Rhino', 'records', 'very', 'limited', 'addition', 'CD.Only', '2500', 'copies', 'have', 'been', 'pressed', 'so', 'may', 'suggest', 'like', 'numbers', 'movie', 'will', 'love', 'CD', 'also']",N/A
