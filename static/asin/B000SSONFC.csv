1087517,A12AG7Q5ZF9P9X,B000SSONFC,Gene L. Pritchard,"[1, 1]","I found 3 items featuring Edgar Bergan and Charlie McCarthy... I just HAD to have them all.  Of the 3, this was my least favorite, not because it wasn't entertaining, it really was... but it featured Charlie, and the other Bergan family in a way that I wasn't looking for.  They were/are show hosts for a game show... the contestants were entertaining, but I wanted this for the ventriloquism, not just the entertainment value.  The old time programs are enjoyable as they are, but if you want true ventriloquism this isn't the one for you.  If you love to ""go back in time"" to when TV was clean and entertaining, you'll love this DVD.  If I had the opportunity to return it, I would NOT do so... this is indeed classic, and I'm glad to have it in my library.",3,Edgar & Charlie - gotta have 'em!,1268092800,"03 9, 2010",2010,759,"['found', '3', 'items', 'featuring', 'Edgar', 'Bergan', 'Charlie', 'McCarthy', 'just', 'HAD', 'have', '3', 'was', 'least', 'favorite', 'not', 'was', ""n't"", 'entertaining', 'really', 'was', 'featured', 'Charlie', 'other', 'Bergan', 'family', 'way', 'was', ""n't"", 'looking', 'were/are', 'show', 'hosts', 'game', 'show', 'contestants', 'were', 'entertaining', 'wanted', 'ventriloquism', 'not', 'just', 'entertainment', 'value', 'old', 'time', 'programs', 'are', 'enjoyable', 'are', 'want', 'true', 'ventriloquism', ""n't"", 'one', 'love', 'go', 'back', 'time', 'when', 'TV', 'was', 'clean', 'entertaining', ""'ll"", 'love', 'DVD', 'had', 'opportunity', 'return', 'would', 'NOT', 'do', 'so', 'indeed', 'classic', ""'m"", 'glad', 'have', 'library']",Do You Trust Your Wife? - Volume 1

Yep, a ventriloquist called Edgar Bergen hosts the show, Which is basically a ""Comedy Game Show"". The contestants are married couples, and the whole show is very charming in a very 50's way. The picture quality varies, Although thats to be expected with such poorly preserved content. The only problem is that the original commercials have been removed, probably since these appear to be re-run prints. Still, the 4 episodes on this DVD are quite rare, and will be of interest to those who enjoy classy 50's TV.",4,"Quirky 50's Game Show, Which is very enjoyable",1208390400,"04 17, 2008",2008,598,"['50', 'game', 'show', 'notable', 'fact', 'co-costs', 'are', 'made', 'wood', 'Yep', 'ventriloquist', 'called', 'Edgar', 'Bergen', 'show', 'Which', 'basically', 'Comedy', 'Game', 'Show', 'contestants', 'are', 'married', 'couples', 'whole', 'show', 'very', 'charming', 'very', '50', 'way', 'picture', 'quality', 'varies', 'thats', 'be', 'expected', 'such', 'poorly', 'preserved', 'content', 'only', 'problem', 'original', 'commercials', 'have', 'been', 'removed', 'probably', 'appear', 'be', 're-run', 'prints', 'Still', '4', 'episodes', 'DVD', 'are', 'quite', 'rare', 'will', 'be', 'interest', 'who', 'enjoy', 'classy', '50', 'TV']",Do You Trust Your Wife? - Volume 1
