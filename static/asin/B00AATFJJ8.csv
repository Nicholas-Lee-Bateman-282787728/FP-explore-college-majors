The actors are very good, but the stories and script writing suffers from too many cliches and too many of the same tired tropes that have become commonplace in television and movies. My biggest problem with &#34;Ripper Street&#34; is that the heroes largely solve crimes through a mixture of luck and clumsy deus ex machina style writing, foiling the far more competent villains. I think this is a decent show, but the writers need to step up and devote more time to making the scripts as good as the acting.TL:DR - It's OK, but you'd be better off watching &#34;Copper&#34;.",3,"Good acting, okay writing...",1362441600,"03 5, 2013",2013,678,"['are', 'lot', 'things', 'like', 'show', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'strongly', 'recommend', 'actors', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'stories', 'script', 'writing', 'suffers', 'too', 'many', 'cliches', 'too', 'many', 'same', 'tired', 'tropes', 'have', 'become', 'commonplace', 'television', 'movies', 'biggest', 'problem', '34', 'Ripper', 'Street', '34', 'heroes', 'largely', 'solve', 'crimes', 'mixture', 'luck', 'clumsy', 'deus', 'ex', 'machina', 'style', 'writing', 'foiling', 'far', 'more', 'competent', 'villains', 'think', 'decent', 'show', 'writers', 'need', 'step', 'up', 'devote', 'more', 'time', 'making', 'scripts', 'as', 'good', 'acting.TL', 'DR', 'OK', ""'d"", 'be', 'better', 'off', 'watching', '34', 'Copper', '34']",N/A

1607310,A3DXNF2GUDSEHK,B00AATFJJ8,angiegere,"[9, 10]","Initially, my review spoke of the wonderful main stars.  I had thus far only seen the BBC America version of the first 3 episodes.  Tho, I liked the show very much, I found it confusing at times.  But I knew, of course, that I had seen another ""americanized"" cutting of a BBC show.  Just as with MI5, Whitechapel,  and more too numerous to name, the British series is even more amazing than I imagined.  Sometimes, I wonder why I bother watching the commercial cuts at all.  They are no more than a preview of the real thing.  Clearly, this is the whole point.  To get one to purchase ""something you can see for free"" you've got to add more.  I expect that. But, this may be the worst cutting I have ever seen BBC America do.  It's true: you get what you pay for.  Buy it. You'll love it.  (first review starts here):  Matthew Macfadyen back on episodic tv. Well, that took just way too long.  It goes without saying he will make whatever the show that much better just by his presence.  But, yay!  The show's really good, too!  The surprise ""finds"" are Jerome Flynn and Adam Rothenberg.  Initially, found Flynn in ""Game of Thrones""  and was impressed instantly.  He makes quite his own the parts he plays in these two very different series.  Excellent understated acting.  Don't think I had ever seen Rothenberg before, but am looking forward to seeing alot of him in future.  The funny, brilliant, alcoholic medical man with a mysterious past.  You will truly enjoy every second he's on screen and wish there were more.  Macfayden is a true star and one will always want to see anything he's in. He is always that good and that interesting.

1607317,A19L1OUMFT4VNE,B00AATFJJ8,Basilides,"[1, 1]","There are many things to like and enjoy about this series, but the 5th episode, 'The Weight Of One Man's Heart', was a particularly good piece of work. The writing, and direction (except from some extreme facial close-ups in one scene) and the video editing were all first class - as long as you can accept the dramatic aesthetic derived from the graphic novel or 'co-mix' which is becoming almost standard for 'action' films or thrillers these days, whether made for the cinema or for TV. This is certainly how the whole of this series comes across. I have to admit that I usually have a problem with this fast moving style which is frequently so dependent on sensational video editing, gruesome violence, and narrative short cuts or sleight of hand, but not in this case. It was perhaps the best justification for it I have yet come across when taken to this kind of extreme where each story has to fit neatly inside an hour.My own special interest is in the attempt to achieve a dramatically useful and fairly convincing form of period dialogue which distinguishes itself from the usual embarrassingly flat contemporary dialogue which is all that we normally get from historical dramas (e.g. the Ken Folett historical 'epics' such as The Pillars Of the Earth and its sequel World Without End, or the over-praised Game of Thrones). In recent years and for this reason I have been very interested in, and much impressed by, the period dialogue of 'Deadwood' and 'Garrow's Law'.In this respect the 5th episode was much more interesting than the previous one, which managed little more that a few inversions and the like, and which I assume had a different writer who was perhaps only half-hearted in his effort to carry out this aspect of the series brief.But this episode which was the story, including the back-story, of the bare-knuckle prize fighting, ex-soldier, police sergeant Bennet Drake, had much more than period dialogue to offer, although without it I don't think it could have achieved the kind of intensity it did. That is one reason why this kind of dialogue offers such opportunities to the writer. It allows the writer to make the characters more articulate and therefore more conscious of the issues which are driving the drama. It's not just a matter of period dialogue for its own sake, nor is it a matter of its historical accuracy. It's more a matter of the dramatic effectiveness of a heightened and more dramatic dialogue which earlier, and yes often more educated, forms of speech make possible. Above all it's intelligent and goes a long way towards convincing you that the 'graphic novel style' that we have here is also intelligent in some way - as for example the recent BBC serial 'Hunted', or 'Dr Who' (both also in the 'graphic novel style) DO NOT.Although this episode was a powerful self-contained story it undoubtedly gained from our having got to know the character of the sergeant, and his feeling for Rose, in previous episodes. It's unnecessary for me to say anything else about the series as a whole, since this has been well covered by other reviewers here, except to say that although earlier episodes feature serial killers it does move on in later episodes to more social and political issues. The sixth episode which dealt with the activities of the Okhrana in London was almost as good as the 5th. Only at the end did it disappoint and fail to convince with its co-mix book climax.For a very thought provoking discussion of the subject of literacy, language change and education over the last 150 years see 'Doing Our Own Thing: The Degradation of Language and Music, and Why We Should, Like, Care' (2003) by John McWhorter. He argues and provides evidence for the level of education (or practical aspiration) in the 19thc, and later, as enabling even the 'lower classes' to express themselves in an impressively articulate and even 'literary' way, especially in personal letters; and equally capable of understanding what they heard or read, on a level more like the Guardian Review than the Sun.Bring back verse drama.",5,The 5th episode of this series was an especially good 60min TV thriller drama.,1371340800,"06 16, 2013",2013,4067,"['are', 'many', 'things', 'like', 'enjoy', 'series', '5th', 'episode', 'Weight', 'One', 'Man', 'Heart', 'was', 'particularly', 'good', 'piece', 'work', 'writing', 'direction', 'extreme', 'facial', 'close-ups', 'one', 'scene', 'video', 'editing', 'were', 'first', 'class', 'as', 'long', 'can', 'accept', 'dramatic', 'aesthetic', 'derived', 'graphic', 'novel', ""'co-mix"", 'becoming', 'almost', 'standard', ""'action"", 'films', 'thrillers', 'days', 'made', 'cinema', 'TV', 'certainly', 'how', 'whole', 'series', 'have', 'admit', 'usually', 'have', 'problem', 'fast', 'moving', 'style', 'frequently', 'so', 'dependent', 'sensational', 'video', 'editing', 'gruesome', 'violence', 'narrative', 'short', 'cuts', 'sleight', 'hand', 'not', 'case', 'was', 'perhaps', 'best', 'justification', 'have', 'yet', 'come', 'when', 'taken', 'kind', 'extreme', 'where', 'story', 'fit', 'neatly', 'hour.My', 'own', 'special', 'interest', 'attempt', 'achieve', 'dramatically', 'useful', 'fairly', 'convincing', 'form', 'period', 'dialogue', 'usual', 'embarrassingly', 'flat', 'contemporary', 'dialogue', 'normally', 'get', 'historical', 'dramas', 'e.g', 'Ken', 'Folett', 'historical', ""'epics"", 'such', 'Pillars', 'Earth', 'sequel', 'World', 'Without', 'End', 'over-praised', 'Game', 'Thrones', 'recent', 'years', 'reason', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'interested', 'much', 'impressed', 'period', 'dialogue', ""'Deadwood"", ""Law'.In"", 'respect', '5th', 'episode', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'interesting', 'previous', 'one', 'managed', 'little', 'more', 'few', 'inversions', 'like', 'assume', 'had', 'different', 'writer', 'who', 'was', 'perhaps', 'only', 'half-hearted', 'effort', 'carry', 'out', 'aspect', 'series', 'brief.But', 'episode', 'was', 'story', 'including', 'back-story', 'bare-knuckle', 'prize', 'fighting', 'ex-soldier', 'police', 'sergeant', 'Bennet', 'Drake', 'had', 'much', 'more', 'period', 'dialogue', 'offer', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'could', 'have', 'achieved', 'kind', 'intensity', 'did', 'one', 'reason', 'why', 'kind', 'dialogue', 'offers', 'such', 'opportunities', 'writer', 'writer', 'make', 'characters', 'more', 'articulate', 'therefore', 'more', 'conscious', 'issues', 'are', 'driving', 'drama', 'not', 'just', 'matter', 'period', 'dialogue', 'own', 'sake', 'matter', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'more', 'matter', 'dramatic', 'effectiveness', 'heightened', 'more', 'dramatic', 'dialogue', 'earlier', 'yes', 'often', 'more', 'educated', 'forms', 'speech', 'make', 'possible', 'intelligent', 'long', 'way', 'convincing', ""'graphic"", 'novel', 'style', 'have', 'here', 'also', 'intelligent', 'way', 'example', 'recent', 'BBC', 'serial', ""'Hunted"", ""'Dr"", 'Who', 'also', ""'graphic"", 'novel', 'style', 'DO', 'episode', 'was', 'powerful', 'self-contained', 'story', 'undoubtedly', 'gained', 'having', 'got', 'know', 'character', 'sergeant', 'feeling', 'Rose', 'previous', 'episodes', 'unnecessary', 'say', 'anything', 'else', 'series', 'whole', 'been', 'well', 'covered', 'other', 'reviewers', 'here', 'say', 'earlier', 'episodes', 'feature', 'serial', 'killers', 'move', 'later', 'episodes', 'more', 'social', 'political', 'issues', 'sixth', 'episode', 'activities', 'Okhrana', 'London', 'was', 'almost', 'as', 'good', '5th', 'Only', 'end', 'did', 'disappoint', 'fail', 'convince', 'co-mix', 'book', 'very', 'thought', 'provoking', 'discussion', 'subject', 'literacy', 'language', 'change', 'education', 'last', '150', 'years', 'see', ""'Doing"", 'Own', 'Thing', 'Degradation', 'Language', 'Music', 'Why', 'Should', 'Care', '2003', 'John', 'McWhorter', 'evidence', 'level', 'education', 'practical', 'aspiration', '19thc', 'later', 'enabling', 'even', ""'lower"", 'classes', 'express', 'impressively', 'articulate', 'even', ""'literary"", 'way', 'especially', 'personal', 'letters', 'equally', 'capable', 'understanding', 'what', 'heard', 'read', 'level', 'more', 'Guardian', 'Review', 'Sun.Bring', 'back', 'verse', 'drama']",N/A

Right off the bat you notice how primitive everything is in policing. He has to find his own coroner and he can't even pay him.

Well worth the cost of purchasing the DVDs for multiple viewings, this series should be required for all secondary and post-secondary students--a bold statement considering how squeamish some American parents can be on one hand while permitting their children to engage in unsavory behavior on the other.

Except for the first episode where they wonder if the ripper returned, it really has nothing to do with Jack the Ripper.

1607342,AYG1U47VFZ165,B00AATFJJ8,"E. Lee Zimmerman ""Trekscribbler (aka Ed)""","[2, 2]","I've no doubt that the appearance of Jack the Ripper on the streets of Whitechapel deliberately played a hand in the development of forensic sciences.  Plenty has been written about that topic alone - by probably hundreds of authors - and it's a legitimate estimation of how police inspectors had to come to grips with emerging disciplines in order to better understand precisely what the Ripper may've been up to, much less figure out how to identify him.  Also, I've no doubt that the Ripper's activities most likely threw all investigations of that era under massive scrutiny ... for could any of these other affairs be attributed to Jack's nefarious deeds?  Indeed, Whitechapel must've operated under the conditions of crisis for several months afterward - if not several years - all the while fearing the killer's frightening return.(NOTE: The following review will contain minor spoilers necessary solely for the discussion of plot and characters.  If you're the kind of reader who prefers a review entirely spoiler-free, then I'd encourage you to skip down to the last two paragraphs for my final assessment.  If, however, you're accepting of a few modest hints at `things to come,' then read on ...)Inspector Reid (the ever reliable Matthew Macfadyen) has a nightmare position: he heads up the notorious H Division tasked with keeping the streets of Whitechapel orderly.  That's never an easy task, considering how many citizens come and go from the East End in pursuit of sex and other devilish deeds.  However, with the help of his trusted sergeant Drake (Jerome Flynn) and a displaced American Pinkerton agent named Homer Jackson (Adam Rothenberg), Reid does what he can to keep his professional and personal life from intersecting all-too-often with the lives of criminals under his jurisdiction.That synopsis out of the way, let me say up front that I found nearly all of this first season of RIPPER STREET a bona fide delight.  What starts out appearing to revolve fairly heavily about the possible affairs of a still-lurking Jack the Ripper quickly evolves into a late 19th century police procedural - think of it as `CSI: Whitechapel' - that plumbs the depths of criminal intents as well as presents a vivid account of the emerging mindset of how science would work hand-in-hand with deductive reasoning to benefit the greater society-at-large.  Thankfully, the stories don't rely on the Ripper's exploits - in fact, only the first and last of these eight episodes tie in centrally with the Ripper mystery - so those critics who've dismissed it as some kind of Ripper-fan-fiction are completely out of their minds if not out of their depth.I'll give a brief summation of each episode, along with a ranking/rating, for those of you interested in some of the finer points:""I Need Light"" (5 out of 5): The premiere episode puts Reid at odds with another inspector who firmly believes that the Ripper has returned to his ugly work.  It's a terrific first episode that introduces most of the program's major players, but it only hints at some of the relationships to come.""In My Protection"" (4 of 5): The death of a popular toymaker brings Reid, Drake, and Jackson aware that a street gang is delivering their own form of law & order to the masses.""The King Came Calling"" (4 of 5): A Whitechapel death turns out to be tied to a London resident's exposure to ergotism as well as another possible fast-acting poison.  It's a difficult episode to stomach as there's plenty of vomiting.""The Good of the City"" (5 of 5): A reformed epileptic prostitute may prove the unfortunate undoing for a local politician and his much-revered physician in the cautionary tale that greatly explores how crime scene analysis forces detectives to explore differing theories.  Outstanding episode.""The Weight of One Man's Heart"" (3 of 5): Some elaborately staged heists end up being tied to Drake's past.  The villain is WAY too dramatic for my tastes, but the episodes finally gives Drake some excellent material to work with.""Tournament of Shadows"" (3 of 5): Another plot-heavy episode explores a conspiracy to infiltrate the unions in order to make a strike against London by foreign interests.  Some interesting ideas get buried under a lot of machination.""A Man of My Company"" (5 of 5): Jackson's past finally rears its ugly head, forcing him to come clean with those near him or to disappear completely.  It's a smart script, elevated by Rothenberg's charm, and it sprinkles plenty of developments that get followed up in the next episode.""What Use Our Work?"" (4 of 5): Reid's personal struggles come full circle - or as close as they may ever get - when Jackson's accused of being the Ripper and the mystery of his vanished daughter put the police on the tails of a traveling industrialist with a very dark secret.RIPPER is meaty viewing, not for the faint of heart.  At times bloody and grim, it's probably not something you want to throw in lightly.  But don't be disillusioned as others have: Jack the Ripper's influence is felt, but it's rarely a central consideration in most of what's available here.  The Ripper's days are past - not that long ago - but what he did continues to haunt these unfortunate souls, and that certainly makes for some outstanding drama.RIPPER STREET is produced by the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), Element Pictures, the Irish Film Board, Look Out Point, and Tiger Aspect Productions.  DVD distribution (stateside) is being handled by BBC America.  As for the technical specifications, clearly no expense has been spared in bringing the streets of Whitechapel to life in this excellent period piece; there's some dynamic cinematography at work constantly, and the producers even employ some clever narrative trickery with the use of sound.  As for the special features, meh; to my surprise, the RIPPER discs were a bit light, presenting some production shorts surrounding the show, some inside looks at the cast and crew, character profiles, and a curious little short which explores whether or not contemporary forensics could uncover Jack the Ripper's long-debated secret identity.  Nice, but I would've liked a commentary or two to explore the filmmaking process in greater depth.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.  RIPPER STREET's inaugural season was an excellent period piece production that portrayed just how the police procedural worked `back in the day.'  I've had the privilege of reading up on some police methods of the time, so I'm making that initial statement from the vantage point of knowing a thing or two about the subject.  Detectives weren't above beating out a confession, and frustrated citizens were extremely likely to take the law into their own hands.  As for the applied forensics explored in these eight episodes, it seemed perhaps a bit advanced, but I couldn't attest to its accuracy as I'm at a loss.  Given Jack the Ripper's appearance on the scene (historically), I wouldn't be surprised to learn of these scientific developments.  Grim, bloody, and pretty bold, RIPPER STREET is dynamite entertainment featuring characters all waiting to explode.In the interests of fairness, I'm pleased to disclose that the fine folks at BBC America provided me with a DVD copy of RIPPER STREET by request for the expressed purposes of completing this review.",4,"RIPPER STREET Feels More like ""CSI: Whitechapel"" At Times Than It Does A

I became a huge fan of Jerome Flynn due to his work as Bronn in Game of Thrones, but I believe that he's even better in his portrayal of Sgt. Bennet Drake -- he simply kills this role without even having to say much; in his hands the character can gut you with just his facial expressions or the look in his eyes alone.  Matthew Macfadyen is a commanding and utterly believable presence as the brilliant and morally upstanding Inspector Edmund Reid, and Adam Rothenberg is a comedic goldmine as the bohemian wild card former surgeon/former Pinkerton Agent Captain Homer Jackson.  The acting and chemistry of the three leads just couldn't be better, and even the actors handling the smaller supporting roles manage to shine more often than not.The costuming and props are also top notch, and really help to fully immerse the viewer in the time and place in which Ripper Street is set.  The writing was for the most part excellent, particularly in terms of the dialogue, which was a veritable feast for the ears.  Aside from a few situations in which the plot got tidied up a bit too neatly, or too quickly, or a tad improbably, the stories were engrossing and well-paced.So long as you are not put out by a series which is gritty, realistically brutal and violent, and at times, more than a shade on the lascivious side, this show is for you.",5,Best New Show of the Year,1364947200,"04 3, 2013",2013,1441,"['watch', 'only', 'one', 'new', 'show', '2013', 'make', 'Ripper', 'Street', 'cast', 'absolutely', 'phenomenal', 'became', 'huge', 'fan', 'Jerome', 'Flynn', 'due', 'work', 'Bronn', 'Game', 'Thrones', 'believe', 'even', 'better', 'portrayal', 'Sgt', 'Bennet', 'Drake', 'simply', 'role', 'even', 'having', 'say', 'much', 'hands', 'character', 'can', 'gut', 'just', 'facial', 'expressions', 'look', 'eyes', 'alone', 'Matthew', 'Macfadyen', 'commanding', 'utterly', 'believable', 'presence', 'brilliant', 'morally', 'upstanding', 'Inspector', 'Edmund', 'Reid', 'Adam', 'Rothenberg', 'comedic', 'goldmine', 'bohemian', 'wild', 'card', 'former', 'surgeon/former', 'Pinkerton', 'Agent', 'Captain', 'Homer', 'Jackson', 'acting', 'chemistry', 'three', 'leads', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'better', 'even', 'actors', 'handling', 'smaller', 'supporting', 'roles', 'manage', 'shine', 'more', 'often', 'not.The', 'costuming', 'props', 'are', 'also', 'top', 'notch', 'really', 'help', 'fully', 'immerse', 'viewer', 'time', 'place', 'Ripper', 'Street', 'set', 'writing', 'was', 'most', 'part', 'excellent', 'particularly', 'terms', 'dialogue', 'was', 'veritable', 'feast', 'ears', 'Aside', 'few', 'situations', 'plot', 'got', 'tidied', 'up', 'bit', 'too', 'neatly', 'too', 'quickly', 'tad', 'improbably', 'stories', 'were', 'engrossing', 'well-paced.So', 'long', 'are', 'not', 'put', 'out', 'series', 'gritty', 'realistically', 'brutal', 'violent', 'times', 'more', 'shade', 'lascivious', 'side', 'show']",N/A

The acting and storyline are superb and the drama and suspense of the show just creates the proper combination for a real winner. Every episode is a mystery and drama story that stands on its own merit and they are first class entertainment.The cinematography is perfectly done to show the era of the storyline and you can see how the poor and lower middle class survived in the hard times before the turn of the century. Every crime and murder lingers on the heels of the Jack the Ripper and he is the suspect in many of the cases but in reality he is not the criminal. The paranoia of the people in the city and of the police who are charged with finding Jack is always in the background of the times. The main characters are portrayed by splendid actors that bring the story to life in a realistic way.The crimes are numerous and each one is a unique story unto itself with criminals from the rich to the poor being involved. Indeed there are even unscrupulous Americans involved in many of the storylines. Corrupt politicians to business people to common murders are investigated and resolved by the local police force that is understaffed and working in a very tough area. The storyline hinges on the weekly efforts of the police to solve the crimes and keep the peace among the residents of London's East End area. It is the beginning of the scientific area where police forensics is beginning to be recognized as a key to solving many crimes and punishing the right people for their criminal acts.BBC simply has a lot of topnotch shows that are available today and this is one of the best.

The actors are all top-notch, some of whom I recognized from other BBC productions or British TV series.

MyAnna Buring is perfect as the scheming all-business madam and Charlene McKenna is a real bright spot in the production as the character Rose.

1607367,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B00AATFJJ8,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[28, 30]","History's enduring fascination with the gruesome crimes of Jack The Ripper continues unabated with yet another example of popular fiction being inspired by the legendary murderer. Truthfully, I have read enough books, seen enough television, and watched enough movies that cast Jack The Ripper into a central role that I feel like he's an old friend--albeit one I wouldn't want to invite home to dinner. So wearily and warily, I sat down to watch the BBC production of ""Ripper Street."" I watch a LOT on BBC, perhaps too much! Having recently watched both ""Whitechapel"" (a Jack tale set in present day) and ""Copper"" (a historical crime drama), I couldn't help seeing ""Ripper Street"" as somewhat of a stylistic cross between both of these shows. ""Ripper Street"" is set in London's East End circa 1889 in the ensuing chaos following the notorious murders. The show centers around a precinct called H Division. Six months after Jack's spree, they are still entrusted to keep the peace within the Whitechapel neighborhood where fear and hysteria run rampant. Although Jack's carnage may be a thing of the past (or is it?), his legacy endures and the streets are far from safe!As more murders start to be discovered, the public paranoia immediately points to Jack's return. It's up to H Division to sort these crimes out and apprehend the real culprits. To be fair, it might not be entirely accurate to call this a show about Jack the Ripper. The atmosphere and setting of the show is historically linked and influenced by these murders, but the plotting stays the course of a more conventional police procedural with different crimes to solve episodically. The always reliable Matthew Macfadyen heads the investigative team with the assistance of Jerome Flynn and Adam Rothenberg. I like Macfadyen's intensity, as usual, and Rothenberg gets more of the personal drama as his relationship with a brothel madam (Myanna Buring) is one of the series' more intriguing side plots. Rounding out the principle cast are a scandal seeking reporter (David Dawson) and a mother haunted by her daughter's death (Amanda Hale). The performances throughout are solidAs I said, the principle plot threads of ""Ripper Street"" have to do with solving new cases. MacFadyen and team are rather progressive, and part of the show's appeal is seeing the evolution of modern police investigative techniques. This can sometimes feel a little too modern as if the show wants to hedge its bets and attract the CSI crowd! Also to appeal to a wider audience, Rothenberg is both an American surgeon and a former Pinkerton. So he brings a different perspective that the other Detective Inspectors can learn from and clash with. But despite some of these conveniences in plotting, the show really does a good job highlighting the panic and fear that distinguishes the Whitechapel area.The staging of the program is impressively dark and dreary. A lot of money seems to have been spent getting the period details just so. A lot of the scenes are shot outside where the sets look spectacular. Sometimes, however, the filming techniques and discordant music feel a little heavy. Overall, though, I think ""Ripper Street"" is very well done from a technical standpoint. I'm afraid, however, that some people will come to the show looking for fast paced action or even something more gruesome. The show is earnest and methodical and it takes its time. Some episodes can feel spectacularly slow and I don't think that it's necessarily a home run right out of the gate. If you stick with it, ""Ripper Street"" finds its rhythm and improves with subsequent episodes as the screenplays can dig into the characters a bit deeper. If you like either crime procedurals or period piece dramas, this might be worth a look.

Don't buy the DVD, don't watch it, and don't complain about it if you do.2. What kind of people would watch a graphically violent show like this? Well, I help the poor and needy and have performed work in animal rescue. In my dealings and life, I have known those who have suffered violence and rape. Let me say this: I have noticed people who want violent shows or novels out of the way tend to treat victims of violence the same way. The victims are patted on their head and sent on their way, and the travesty of the mental, physical, spiritual and emotional damage done to them is never spoken of, addressed, or dealt with. It's treated like it's something invisible that never happened, out of sight, out of mind. People like that do not take evil seriously at all. You know why I occasionally watch programs that have such violence? Because there are good guys in the program that usually put a stop to it, a fantasy many victims never see in their lifetime. It's nice to dream that there is justice for even the worst of the worse (Do you think it's coincidence that some victims of violent crime relate to the Lisbeth Salander character in ""The Girl with the Dragon Tatoo"" so much). Evil like that depicted in this series exists and worse.NOW ON TO WHY THIS SHOW IS EXCELLENT!As I am sure is stated many times, in many reviews, the series takes place in 1889, six months after the Ripper murders. The show focuses on the aftermath and how it colors crimes thereafter...is it Ripper? IS he back? Even if it isn't, will this monster get away, just as Ripper did? Is there no stop to the evil?But even better, and this very oddly took me by surprise, the lack of technology on the show is a perk. No radios, no cell phones, no computers,...well there is a telegraph which poor young PC Hobbs struggles with in the first episode (""Come on boy, this is the future,"" shouts Reid as Hobbs struggles to make the telegraph work). No Mass spectrometers, no GC's, or HPLC's, or DNA profiling. When the bad guy shouts, ""You'll never get there in time,"" it actually may be true and not cliched. There is no car or police helicopter to ferry the good guys in time...a horse drawn carriage at best? Will they make it? Or in episode 2, when Reid, Drake, Ms Goren and innocent children are trapped at the Jewish orphanage, completely surrounded by the boys gang and their Fagan, Carmichael,...no one at the precinct or anywhere else for that matter knows what's going on or that they are even there (Jackson knows, but that would be a spoiler). There is no phone or 911 to call for help. They have to wait it out until dawn and hope for the best. And when the boys gang breaks through and all hell breaks loose, will anyone go to save them in time?I will say for all of us in the states I had no real clue how much BBC America cut, probably to fit in commercials more than censorship, until I saw the DVD. Suddenly things that didn't make sense became crystal clear. Anyone who enjoyed the series on BBC America should absolutely get the DVD set to see what they missed.Its hard to pick a favorite episode. I can't wait for season 2. The only challenge to the show is some of the Victorian era slang, which is supplied below:Cracksman - A burgler, a safecracker.Crusher - Policeman.Lurk - Place of concealment.Molly house - homosexual, specifically transvestite, brothel.Nipper - Young child.Pig - Policeman, usually a detective.Rookery - Slum or ghetto.Scratch - Line drawn in the ground where boxers stand at the beginning of a round.Snide - Counterfeit money.Thomas - Prostitute's client.Toff - well-dressed or upper-class person, generally male.Toffer - High class prostitute.",5,I LOVE THIS SERIES!,1363996800,"03 23, 2013",2013,3918,"['Let', 'start', 'out', 'addressing', 'haters', 'first:1.', 'simple', 'thing', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'programs', 'graphic', 'violence', 'nudity', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Europe', 'looser', 'standards', 'nudity', 'US', 'wo', ""n't"", 'like', 'show', 'Do', ""n't"", 'buy', 'DVD', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'do', ""n't"", 'complain', 'do.2', 'What', 'kind', 'people', 'would', 'watch', 'graphically', 'violent', 'show', 'Well', 'help', 'poor', 'needy', 'have', 'performed', 'work', 'animal', 'rescue', 'dealings', 'life', 'have', 'known', 'who', 'have', 'suffered', 'violence', 'rape', 'Let', 'say', 'have', 'noticed', 'people', 'who', 'want', 'violent', 'shows', 'novels', 'way', 'tend', 'treat', 'victims', 'violence', 'same', 'way', 'victims', 'are', 'patted', 'head', 'sent', 'way', 'travesty', 'mental', 'physical', 'spiritual', 'emotional', 'damage', 'done', 'never', 'spoken', 'addressed', 'dealt', 'treated', 'something', 'invisible', 'never', 'happened', 'sight', 'mind', 'People', 'do', 'not', 'take', 'evil', 'seriously', 'know', 'why', 'occasionally', 'watch', 'programs', 'have', 'such', 'violence', 'are', 'good', 'guys', 'program', 'usually', 'put', 'stop', 'fantasy', 'many', 'victims', 'never', 'see', 'lifetime', 'nice', 'dream', 'justice', 'even', 'worst', 'worse', 'Do', 'think', 'coincidence', 'victims', 'violent', 'crime', 'relate', 'Lisbeth', 'Salander', 'character', 'Girl', 'Dragon', 'Tatoo', 'so', 'much', 'Evil', 'depicted', 'series', 'worse.NOW', 'ON', 'TO', 'WHY', 'THIS', 'SHOW', 'IS', 'EXCELLENT', 'am', 'sure', 'stated', 'many', 'times', 'many', 'reviews', 'series', 'place', '1889', 'six', 'months', 'Ripper', 'murders', 'show', 'aftermath', 'how', 'crimes', 'thereafter', 'Ripper', 'back', 'Even', ""n't"", 'will', 'monster', 'get', 'away', 'just', 'Ripper', 'did', 'Is', 'no', 'stop', 'evil', 'even', 'better', 'very', 'oddly', 'took', 'surprise', 'lack', 'technology', 'show', 'perk', 'radios', 'cell', 'phones', 'computers', 'well', 'telegraph', 'poor', 'young', 'PC', 'Hobbs', 'first', 'episode', 'Come', 'boy', 'future', 'Reid', 'Hobbs', 'make', 'telegraph', 'work', 'No', 'Mass', 'spectrometers', 'GC', 'HPLC', 'DNA', 'profiling', 'When', 'bad', 'guy', 'shouts', ""'ll"", 'never', 'get', 'there', 'time', 'actually', 'may', 'be', 'true', 'not', 'cliched', 'car', 'police', 'helicopter', 'ferry', 'good', 'guys', 'time', 'horse', 'drawn', 'carriage', 'best', 'Will', 'make', 'episode', '2', 'when', 'Reid', 'Drake', 'Ms', 'Goren', 'innocent', 'children', 'are', 'trapped', 'Jewish', 'orphanage', 'completely', 'surrounded', 'boys', 'gang', 'Fagan', 'Carmichael', 'one', 'precinct', 'anywhere', 'else', 'matter', 'what', 'going', 'are', 'even', 'there', 'Jackson', 'would', 'be', 'spoiler', 'phone', '911', 'call', 'help', 'have', 'wait', 'out', 'dawn', 'hope', 'best', 'when', 'boys', 'gang', 'breaks', 'hell', 'breaks', 'loose', 'will', 'anyone', 'go', 'save', 'time', 'will', 'say', 'states', 'had', 'real', 'clue', 'how', 'much', 'BBC', 'America', 'cut', 'probably', 'fit', 'commercials', 'more', 'censorship', 'saw', 'DVD', 'Suddenly', 'things', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'became', 'crystal', 'clear', 'Anyone', 'who', 'enjoyed', 'series', 'BBC', 'America', 'should', 'absolutely', 'get', 'DVD', 'set', 'see', 'what', 'missed.Its', 'hard', 'pick', 'favorite', 'episode', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'season', '2', 'only', 'challenge', 'show', 'Victorian', 'era', 'slang', 'supplied', 'Cracksman', 'burgler', 'safecracker.Crusher', 'Policeman.Lurk', 'Place', 'concealment.Molly', 'house', 'homosexual', 'specifically', 'transvestite', 'brothel.Nipper', 'Young', 'child.Pig', 'Policeman', 'usually', 'detective.Rookery', 'Slum', 'ghetto.Scratch', 'Line', 'drawn', 'ground', 'where', 'boxers', 'stand', 'beginning', 'round.Snide', 'Counterfeit', 'money.Thomas', 'Prostitute', 'client.Toff', 'well-dressed', 'upper-class', 'person', 'generally', 'male.Toffer', 'High', 'class', 'prostitute']",N/A

1607378,A2VF25F0XZHXMW,B00AATFJJ8,London Fog,"[4, 10]","While this series boasts an excellent concept with a budget and actors that could easily have pulled off an outstanding period drama, from the first episode, Ripper Street comes off as a flashy Sherlock Holmes knockoff with a more authentically dressed cast. From the opening scene in a bare knuckle boxing ring that utilized similar choreography as the Robert Downey Jr. movie, to the music score and visual style of the credits - there is even a US army surgeon who plays the role not unlike that of Jude Law's Watson. Unfortunately, this series, or rather, the detectives therein and the mediocre scripting, falls flat of the challenge. Instead of being a Holmes inspired series with merits by its own rights, it comes off as nothing more than a sensationalistic, overly abrasive modern crime drama that happens to have Victorian era sets, costumes and speech (mostly). This was not a bad series, per se, but something significant about the time period was lost in the attempt to make this appeal to the average viewer.How, then, does it fare as a generic crime drama?Lukewarm, at best. The plots were nothing spectacular, only somewhat interesting, but did keep me watching, though there was often nothing but friction and shouting between the characters. While some tension is necessary, this was too heavy handed, and I confess the lack of chemistry between anyone is what eventually turned me off entirely. There were also a few convoluted plot moments, in particular a scene in the first episode where the detective pulls a piece of something from the victim's body, only to instantly declare it gelatin from a meat pie... how is this ascertained? Again, if they were going for the Holmesian deductions, those were always clear, concise, and followed by an explanation. This wasn't. It felt more like a rabbit pulled out of a hat than anything of cerebral merit. I am also still wondering as to what the purpose of that scene with the inspector's head between the legs of a prostitute was - besides a cheap bid for ratings, that is? In the tradition of some of the BBC's more recent productions, bits and pieces of this qualified as soft core porn.Technically, I would give Ripper Street 2.5 stars, though all of them are for the period costumes, which were honestly my favourite aspect. Even the acting could not redeem this series entirely - and strangely enough, everyone seemed to speak with a cockney accent, irregardless of their station or social class. So while this was still very watchable, it's nothing memorable or of particular note. For anyone interested in British crime dramas of a similar vein but with better plots, scripts and a more character driven mystery, I would heartily recommend Whitechapel.",3,Unimpressive,1359504000,"01 30, 2013",2013,2726,"['series', 'excellent', 'concept', 'budget', 'actors', 'could', 'easily', 'have', 'pulled', 'off', 'outstanding', 'period', 'drama', 'first', 'episode', 'Ripper', 'Street', 'off', 'flashy', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', 'knockoff', 'more', 'authentically', 'dressed', 'cast', 'opening', 'scene', 'bare', 'knuckle', 'boxing', 'ring', 'utilized', 'similar', 'choreography', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'movie', 'music', 'score', 'visual', 'style', 'credits', 'even', 'US', 'army', 'surgeon', 'who', 'role', 'not', 'Jude', 'Law', 'Watson', 'Unfortunately', 'series', 'rather', 'detectives', 'therein', 'mediocre', 'scripting', 'flat', 'challenge', 'Instead', 'being', 'Holmes', 'inspired', 'series', 'merits', 'own', 'rights', 'off', 'nothing', 'more', 'sensationalistic', 'overly', 'abrasive', 'modern', 'crime', 'drama', 'have', 'Victorian', 'era', 'sets', 'costumes', 'speech', 'mostly', 'was', 'not', 'bad', 'series', 'se', 'something', 'significant', 'time', 'period', 'was', 'lost', 'attempt', 'make', 'appeal', 'average', 'viewer.How', 'then', 'fare', 'generic', 'crime', 'drama', 'Lukewarm', 'best', 'plots', 'were', 'nothing', 'spectacular', 'only', 'somewhat', 'interesting', 'did', 'keep', 'watching', 'was', 'often', 'nothing', 'friction', 'shouting', 'characters', 'tension', 'necessary', 'was', 'too', 'heavy', 'handed', 'confess', 'lack', 'chemistry', 'anyone', 'what', 'eventually', 'turned', 'off', 'entirely', 'were', 'also', 'few', 'convoluted', 'plot', 'moments', 'particular', 'scene', 'first', 'episode', 'where', 'detective', 'piece', 'something', 'victim', 'body', 'only', 'instantly', 'declare', 'meat', 'pie', 'how', 'ascertained', 'Again', 'were', 'going', 'Holmesian', 'deductions', 'were', 'always', 'clear', 'concise', 'followed', 'explanation', 'was', ""n't"", 'felt', 'more', 'rabbit', 'pulled', 'out', 'hat', 'anything', 'cerebral', 'merit', 'am', 'also', 'still', 'wondering', 'what', 'purpose', 'scene', 'inspector', 'head', 'legs', 'prostitute', 'was', 'cheap', 'bid', 'ratings', 'tradition', 'BBC', 'more', 'recent', 'productions', 'bits', 'pieces', 'qualified', 'soft', 'core', 'porn.Technically', 'would', 'give', 'Ripper', 'Street', '2.5', 'stars', 'are', 'period', 'costumes', 'were', 'honestly', 'favourite', 'aspect', 'Even', 'acting', 'could', 'not', 'redeem', 'series', 'entirely', 'strangely', 'enough', 'everyone', 'seemed', 'speak', 'cockney', 'accent', 'irregardless', 'station', 'social', 'class', 'So', 'was', 'still', 'very', 'watchable', 'nothing', 'memorable', 'particular', 'note', 'anyone', 'interested', 'British', 'crime', 'dramas', 'similar', 'vein', 'better', 'plots', 'scripts', 'more', 'character', 'driven', 'mystery', 'would', 'heartily', 'recommend', 'Whitechapel']",N/A

Is the Ripper back? Will he strike again? Inspector Abberline believes so at every turn. And a return to the grisly fear of autumn of blood is the last thing that Whitechapel needs. Crime runs rampant and there are murders aplenty without the Ripper.Inspector Reid, (Matthew Macfadyen), who lost his daughter while trailing a Jack the Ripper suspect, and Sgt.

Though the setting is post-Ripper, it does reference the murders throughout the season, interweaving it with the various story-lines. Matthew Macfadyen plays Inspector Edmund Reid and apparently he failed in his efforts to track and find Jack the Ripper. He has other issues to deal with now, along with haunting memories of what happend to his young daughter.  Every episode has its own murder mystery to solve. Some are more complex than others, but all are very intriguing to watch. There is too much information to go in to, but I want to point out that the period details in Ripper Street are superb. The costumes, scenery and props look so authentic and it really helps to pull you into the show. I'm not sure what sort of money was spent on this series, but I love when little details like this aren't overlooked.  All the actors do a fine job and each one has their own story to tell. We learn a little bit more about each one as the series progresses. Though it may seem slow-paced at times, I never got bored or tired from it. The writing is fantastic and requires attention so you don't miss out on the smalled detail.
