The marketing concept behind this collection is acutally quite good, though understandibly frustrating, because several different types of fans will likely consider purchasing it, even if you already own the full seasons, due to the extras. There are certainly several great episodes in this collection, some of the best in the series IMO, and the only criticisms I have of it are relatively minor: giving titles/themes to the volumes of this 'Mythology Collection' when there's little consistency within those titles/themes and, as other reviewers have mentioned, some episodes crucial to the overall story, though not necessarily involved directly per se, were omitted for some strange reason.Despite those two minor occurances this is an entertaining show and a well put-together collection.

I also came to see them as tedious, confusing and arbitrary as well. However, when I began to consume my X Files in ways other than a weekly one hour dose, they not only came to make more sense to me, they became my favorite XF eps, to the point that many of the MOTW and other stories took a backseat to the Myth arc. Carter and Co. may have given themelves a wide berth for plenty of improvisation, but the basic jist of the story is almost painfully simple when you watch the Myth arc in order. A close encounter of the fourth kind is followed by an insidious program of colonization- abduction, implantation, impregnation, genetic manipulation, and planned annhilation are what the greys have in store for us. The XF crew don't allow you much contact with the aliens themselves- that would allow you to familiarize them, perhaps even humanize them. As it is, the Conspirators are barely human.This volume has the added bonus of containing the poignant Scully Cancer arc, a frightening second act to the Scully abduction story of the first volume. You'll get a heaping helping of Vancouver rain, mud and gloom as well- creating an ambience  the series missed terribly when the production moved to sunny LA.Perhaps Fox is milking the still healthy X-Phile Nation with these boxes, but for many fans who haven't yet taken the DVD plunge, this may be a good place to start.

The four mythology sets contain most of the story arc scripts.  This, the second set, contained some of the best ideas.  By the third season, the premise had been established.  There were hints of contacts with extraterrestrials, evidence of genetic manipulation, unexplained abductions, and alien viruses to which doctors in rival countries were trying to develop immunity.  There was more action in several episodes - a frenetic search for a virus transported by train, and a grim stay in a Soviet prison camp.

908875,A1XO58KR12PC91,B0009NZ2RE,"Iqbal Faizer ""Muldfeld""","[6, 14]","Let me first say these episodes deserve 5 stars.  They essentially encompass the climax of the series' mythology (its most fascinating element) and are incredible in all terms:  acting, story, cinematography, the fabulous background music of Mark Snow, which I'd hoped Fox would allow him to release on CD (only his earlier, inferior music is available).The stories are simply better told with dialogue more interestingly done than before in the series;  up to this point, stories and dialogue sometimes seemed a bit slow-paced and dull, in addition to seriously lacking in the special effects department due to insufficient funding.  Starting with these episodes, the show seemed to evolve into a whole new entity -- its dramatic effects twice as powerful as what they were before.  These episodes required repeated viewing to fully comprehend the increasingly complex plot, but this was hardly a chore since they were so beautifully done and had so much dramatic depth to explore as well.  They made me an unapologetic fan (yes, my friend nicknamed me after two characters I was imitating at the time:  Seinfeld and Mulder), and made this my still-favorite show of all time.My reasons for 3 stars have to do with the few commentary tracks available, which are done only by directors.  No offense to Rob Bowman, Kim Manners, and R.W. Goodwin, but director commentaries are never as interesting as those done by the writers.  These episodes are available on full-season sets, which I already own, and which have great non-mythology episodes to attract those who haven't bought either, despite their exhorbitant price.  While I would like to see Chris Carter's documentary on this part of the mythology, it still isn't really worth it to me.  The whole reason I bought the first mythology set was to hear writers' commentaries on the mythology episodes they largely avoided in the show's season long DVD sets.

I would always look forward to seeing it, whether a rerun or a new show. Though I missed many, many, many episodes during its 9 year life (I was never really one to be glued to the TV for any show), I have been frustrated in my efforts to watch episodes I have missed, mostly due to the expense of the Complete Season DVD sets. It is once in a blue moon that I can afford to put down as much as $120 for a TV show, so I've done without for a long time, barring my ownership of Season 3. Also, I've found that the episodes I care the most about catching up on are the ones that push the main story line along-- the ones dealing with the government-conspiracy-alien-takeover story line; something I've since learned is referred to as ""the Mythology arc."" This will sound lame (even to this writer) but the Bare Naked Ladies song ""One Week"" summarized my hopes when sitting down to watch the X-Files. ""I hope the Smoking Man is in this one."" The smoking man's involvement in an episode usually indicated a furthering of the overall plot, the mythology arc. In short, these are the Smoking Man episodes.Vol 2 of the most current repackaging (though I found ""slimmer"" versions of complete Seasons 1, 2, and 3 which are cheaper than the originals), takes us further down the rabbit hole, with the mythology episodes from Seasons 3 - 6.  Early acting jitters from Gillian Anderson and David Duchovany (seen in seasons one an two) are all but gone.  And with the monster of the week episodes gone, what remains is arguably the best material in the X-Files history, particularly in the first two discs.  Sure, certain helpful episodes are noticably absent (especially to X-heads), but few can argue with what's here; all killer no filler.  Though typical fans rate Seasons one through five as *****, then taper off the scores of the last half of the show's life, don't let that scare away the curious.  The last two Volumes of this repackaging are stellar, not to mention a great value @ $30.I can't say any of the episodes or seasons or Volumes are my favorite, but ""Black Oil"" comes close.  I mean, body jumping alien liquid trying to get back to its ship in a forgotten silo in the middle of nowhere?  C'mon!  Forget about it; it's solid, television gold.

908878,A16QODENBJVUI1,B0009NZ2RE,Robert Moore,"[35, 55]","I'm still not convinced that this series of inexpensive boxed with minimal new special features that present the mythology episodes of THE X-FILES is all that desirable or that it should take priority over a complete reissue of the individual seasons in more reasonably priced editions. Nonetheless, it is a great way of calling attention to the extraordinary importance of THE X-FILES in taking long-story-arc television to the next level.THE X-FILES always functioned on two level: first, it consisted of a host of standalone episodes that are probably the finest set of supernatural stories on TV since the glory days of THE TWILIGHT ZONE. Because the box here is focused on the mythology episodes, I won't say more about these here. The second level of THE X-FILES was the mythology episodes, a series of individual shows that taken together over nine seasons told the story of an international government conspiracy to hide the truth about human-alien encounters, as well as the reason for that conspiracy. It is almost impossible to stress the importance of these episodes, because they helped recreate what was possible on commercial television, and has helped provide a template for the future of television. I earnestly believe that THE X-FILES was one of three television shows that jointly reinvented what was possible on television. Briefly, here is a short account of what these shows accomplished:The first of the three shows was TWIN PEAKS (which, by the way, dealt in its second half with alien abduction-one of the abductees being the actor who would play Scully's father later on--featured as a minor character a transvestite FBI agent played by David Duchovny). Many will remember what a bombshell TWIN PEAKS was when it first appeared on TV. It was the first series on TV to show that the medium could provide entertainment as absorbing and as artistically complex as movies. But most importantly, it told a story that took a couple of dozen episodes to tell, and completely shattered the convention that a story had to fit in a single episode. On the other hand, it was completely different from soap operas or shows like HILL STREET BLUES in that it was attempting to tell a story with a beginning, a middle, and an end. These other shows had continuity from week to week, and things happened to the characters over a long series of episodes, but there really wasn't a story as such that they were trying to tell. But TWIN PEAKS did. Unfortunately, after one of the greatest-perhaps the greatest-first seasons in the history of TV, TWIN PEAKS faltered badly in the second season, starting yet one mystery after another without resolving any, piling oddness on top of mystery. The lesson to be learned: the narrative must be consistent and it must go somewhere.THE X-FILES was one of the first shows to benefit by the new creative space created by TWIN PEAKS. Chris Carter and his cohorts didn't repeat the mistake of resolving no mysteries or not allowing the narrative to proceed to definite places. And because the show did not fall apart in its second season like TWIN PEAKS did, it was able to do something that had never been done on TV before: expand its ongoing story over a stretch of several years. It was an astonishing achievement and as a result is not merely a great show because of the enjoyment it provides, but because of the influence it has exerted on the development of TV. Nonetheless, the mythology arc of THE X-FILES had at least two problems. First, as Chris Carter and others have admitted, the story arc was more or less made up as they went along, and it sometimes shows. At several points the arc is shifted in a way that seems intended to surprise the viewers. For instance, until in Season Seven we get an authoritative account of what happened to Mulder's sister Samantha, several versions of what happened to her were trotted out. And who was Mulder's biological father? If you watch all of the commentaries on the DVD sets, you will discover that even well into the series the primary producers of the show weren't sure who Mulder's father was. In the final episode, ""The Truth,"" they finally clear this up by baldly stating that it was the Cigarette Smoking Man, but they could easily have stated the opposite. So, there was an inconsistency in tone and in fact caused by a lack of long-term planning. Second, the show erred by focusing primarily on either that week's mystery or the great conspiracy that was the subject of the mythology, whereas any fan of the show could tell what really fascinated us about the show: Mulder and Scully. Eventually, the show became more about Mulder and Scully than the conspiracy, but it took a while. The lesson to be learned? You must plan your story arc ahead of time and the focus must be on the characters and not the mystery.THE X-FILES made possible the third crucial show in the recreation of the possibilities for TV: BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER. What did BUFFY add to the mix? Two things. First, BUFFY had long story arcs that extended over the course of not merely several episodes but over seasons, much like THE X-FILES. But unlike THE X-FILES there was far more long-term planning. For instance, in a late Season Three episode one character says something to another than in retrospect was a clear reference to something that happened two years later. This enabled far more internal consistency in the story arc than we saw in THE X-FILES. The second, and perhaps more important, addition was the focus from the beginning of the show to its end on character rather than situation. If in THE X-FILES the emotional life of Mulder and Scully was somewhat in the background and the conspiracy in the foreground, on BUFFY the emotional lives and relationships of Buffy, Willow, Angel, Spike, and Xander were the focus, while the villains and monsters were background. But it must be noted that without the exceptional success of THE X-FILES in ratings, BUFFY would never have been allowed to take the long-story-arc to the next level.Where has all of this gotten us? The heirs of TWIN PEAKS/THE X-FILES/BUFFY THE VAMPURE SLAYER include: DARK ANGEL, ALIAS, FARSCAPE, WONDERFALLS, ANGEL, FIREFLY, DEAD LIKE ME, CARNIVALE, SIX FEET UNDER, SMALLVILLE, 24, THE WIRE, and LOST. If one reads LOST's co-creator Damon Lindelhof's comments in an April issue of ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY, it is obvious that many producers are acutely aware of the changes that the three shows I noted above had wrought. He mentions explicitly LOST's debt to TWIN PEAKS and THE X-FILES (as well as the lessons to learn from the mistakes of the two shows) as well as the success of BUFFY in shifting the focus to character, and the intent of producers and writers to continue in that tradition.So, while I'm not sure that these four DVD boxed sets address any real need, and while I'm absolutely convinced we would have been better served by new, far less expensive versions of the individual season boxed sets, these sets do serve to call attention to the long story arc of the show that along with TWIN PEAKS and BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER did more than anyother to establish the long story arc as the highest form of television art. My conviction is that we are at the beginning of what could be a permanent trend in television, as the medium moves more and more away from the standalone episode, and more and more towards long story

908879,A96JD9312DHWC,B0009NZ2RE,"TorridlyBoredShopper ""T(to the)B(to the)S""","[1, 1]","We know Fox Mulder and the quest he is on. We also know his companions and the people who chase him mercilessly, and we know what would happen if he gave up. That said, there is more to it all than meets the eye. There are abductions that happen, muddy little pools of the past lying in wait for the next foolhardy onlookers to come, colonization plans hatching, and soliders that are super - thanks for asking! I like that a lot and I have to give the writers a lot of credit. Even shows that model themselves after the X's cannot seem to place the right amount of boom in that sphere of intrigue.After noting exactly what happened in the years (3 seasons) that added up to the event that encapsulated ""Abductions,"" the X-Files turned to another story arch. This time it dealt with a mysterious fluid call the Black Oil which, by the show's accounts, began tormenting humans in the wayyy wayyy back. In fact, the one thing that this is missing is the movie ""Fight the Future,"" where you see the aliens attacking some really acient wayfarers. True, these are collections of the series and, true, the timeline you get with this includes these run-ins. Still, some of the pieces here are missing a little.One thing that runs a little off-base is the fact that not all of this is turly about Black Oil. While many episodes are, some are simply furthering the aliens and what they do AND this is what is called Black Oil. Even some of Colonization could actually be considered Black Oil if someone wanted to argue it, but the point of the matter is that there is a story inside of a story. If you can put this aside and watch what is happening, there is some nice stuff showcased here. When you combine that with the timeline that comes with the series - it is supposed to have that and if it does not then you shoudl not get it - you get explanations about the new players in the macabre planetary combine that chews on human will. These include ""X,"" Marita Covarrubias,"" ""Alex Krychek,"" ""Jeremiah Smith,"" ""Alien Bounty Hunter,"" Micheal Kritschgau,"" and ""Max Fenig."" They ar enot limited to these, but these are the ones mentioned.Of all the things contained within this series, I like these pieces the best. The headlines are easily missed sometimes and you could possibly debate the inclusion of some pieces here. I personally love that part of it all, asking and hearing ideas, seeing what people have included in their ""truths."" Also, there are some extras BUT NOT much, with a few optonal interviews and a deleted scene sometimes. The interviews seem to average 1 - 3 or 1 - 4, so they are not a biggie.
