569975,A25CZCHLNH3OMO,B000056N94,Cuckoo Pine Nut,"[12, 15]","If you don't want to know anything about the plot of this movie 'til you watch it, stop reading right here. I shall not belabour myself over plot, but some details always get in anyway.This was a good story of learning to adapt your ways and get rid of prejudices to make oneself agreeable to others so that everyone can live in peace. Skippy Homeier as Emil really did an excellent job and took the show away from Betty Field and Fredric March, and even the little girl who plays the daughter Pat, but I would definitely say that the story mostly centres on the children. Which is nice because there aren't many movies (fairly realistic ones) where the main action concerns children. Overall it is a very good movie. Emil does hit Pat on the head with a poker toward the end, but it doesn't really show anything, just his shadow as he wields the instrument.The two main conflicts are Emil's hatred for his father (he was taught that Carl Bruckner was a traitor to the Third Reich, but in reality he was a good man who fought against it with his books) and the fact that Betty Fields' character was Jewish. The less important problems concern Stan being Polish and the fact that Emil wants to take charge and make everyone do things the way he knows to do them. The whole town (or neighbourhood) turns against Emil one by one, and at his birthday party Pat had to bribe three boys to come.Of course, in the end, everything works out to the benefit of everyone involved, and they all lived happily ever after.I think you should give this movie a chance at least because it's a good story.",4,"I want an illuminated watch, with seventeen jewels...",1031875200,"09 13, 2002",2002,1587,"['do', ""n't"", 'want', 'know', 'anything', 'plot', 'movie', 'watch', 'stop', 'reading', 'right', 'here', 'shall', 'not', 'belabour', 'plot', 'details', 'always', 'get', 'anyway.This', 'was', 'good', 'story', 'learning', 'adapt', 'ways', 'get', 'rid', 'prejudices', 'make', 'agreeable', 'others', 'everyone', 'can', 'live', 'peace', 'Skippy', 'Homeier', 'Emil', 'really', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'took', 'show', 'away', 'Betty', 'Field', 'Fredric', 'March', 'even', 'little', 'girl', 'who', 'daughter', 'Pat', 'would', 'definitely', 'say', 'story', 'mostly', 'children', 'Which', 'nice', 'are', ""n't"", 'many', 'movies', 'fairly', 'realistic', 'ones', 'where', 'main', 'action', 'concerns', 'children', 'Overall', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'Emil', 'hit', 'Pat', 'head', 'poker', 'end', ""n't"", 'really', 'show', 'anything', 'just', 'shadow', 'instrument.The', 'two', 'main', 'conflicts', 'are', 'Emil', 'hatred', 'father', 'was', 'taught', 'Carl', 'Bruckner', 'was', 'traitor', 'Third', 'Reich', 'reality', 'was', 'good', 'man', 'who', 'fought', 'books', 'fact', 'Betty', 'Fields', 'character', 'was', 'Jewish', 'less', 'important', 'problems', 'concern', 'Stan', 'being', 'Polish', 'fact', 'Emil', 'take', 'charge', 'make', 'everyone', 'do', 'things', 'way', 'do', 'whole', 'town', 'neighbourhood', 'Emil', 'one', 'one', 'birthday', 'party', 'Pat', 'had', 'bribe', 'three', 'boys', 'come.Of', 'course', 'end', 'everything', 'out', 'benefit', 'everyone', 'involved', 'lived', 'happily', 'ever', 'after.I', 'think', 'should', 'give', 'movie', 'chance', 'least', 'good', 'story']",N/A

Probably too politically incorrect for any network to show now. The way Skip says ""that's regrettable"" when he finds out someone is a Jew or Pole is jaw-dropping. And when he looks out into space while describing the Fuehrer, it's really spooky. Some of the other comments about America have shock value even today. Skip Homier was actually in the broadway play of Tomorrow The World from 1943-1944, so he had plenty of practice perfecting the part. If you check Wikipedia you can learn more about him. As to the movie, while a period propaganda piece, it still stands up well today. I wish I could give it six stars, it's that good.

569977,A2FOT0QE23VN6J,B000056N94,Dr. James Gardner,"[1, 1]","""Tomorrow the World"" is a 1944 black and white political drama based on a popular 1943 play of the same name. It's one of the few films to deal with the Hitler Youth.The great Frederic March stars as the head of an American family who adopt their German nephew who was raised in the Hitler Youth. March won an Oscar for ""Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde"" (1931) and ""The Best Years of Our Lives"" (1946), and earned three more nominations. He won the Golden Globe for ""Death of a Salesman"" (1951) and earned two more nominations. He won two Tonys (""Years Ago"" and ""Long Days Journey Into Night""). He appeared in more than 50 films between 1921 and 1973. Personally I think his best performance was as Matthew Brady in ""Inherit the Wind"" (1960).Betty Field (1916-73) co-stars as March's Jewish fianc&eacute;. She does a fine job, but doesn't steal this film as she did with ""Kings Row"" (1942) and  ""Shepherd of the Hills"" (1941). Field is best remembered for her body of work on Broadway, but she made more than a dozen films including Mae in ""Of Mice and Men"" (1939), and played Nellie in ""Peyton Place"" (1957).Agnes Morehead (1900-74) plays March's sister. She earned an Academy Award nomination as Best Supporting Actress four times (""Magnificent Ambersons"", ""Hush Hush Sweet Charlotte"", ""Johnny Belinda"", ""Mrs Parkington""), along with 6 Emmy nominations for her role in ""Bewitched"" and a win for a role in ""Wild Wild West"" (1965). She also won two Golden Globes.Skippy Homeier (1930) plays the boy. Homeier is one of the few to make the transition from child actor to playing adult roles. He started his career in radio and then on Broadway in 1943 he played a 14 year old Nazi in ""Tomorrow the World"" and made his film debut here. ""Gunfighter"" (1950) was the first of his young adult roles and he followed these with appearances in ""Halls of Montezuma"" (1950), ""Fixed Bayonets"" (1951) and ""The Last Posse"" (1953). He became active in TV in the early 50s and appeared in several series (""Dan Raven"", ""The Interns"").Joan Carroll (1932) steals the show as March's spunky daughter. She made a dozen films and is probably best known as Judy Garland's younger sister in ""Meet me in St Louis"" (1944)The film's director, English born Leslie Fenton (1902-78), was a busy actor in the 20s and 30s, then turned to directing, mostly B westerns (""The Man from Dakota"", ""Whispering Smith"", ""Streets of Laredo"").The depiction of life in small town America is a bit idealized, including how naturally Jewish Betty Field is going to marry Christian Frederic March. And the optimistic ending comes a little too quickly and a little too neatly to be considered biography. Moreover it's not really clear why a well indoctrinated Hitler Youth is being sent to the U.S. when he could be used for the war effort- in 1944 Germany sorely needed any strapping 14 year old. In fact, as early as 1943 the Hitler Youth had been converted to military units.Variety called it a ""vivid story"" and said ""the main accolade must go to Skippy Homeier"". Classic Film, Guide called it ""an above average drama"" with a ""compelling performance by Skip Homeier"".Many films about WW 2 include a scene or two about a member of the Hitler Youth (e.g., ""Cabaret"", ""The Bridge""), but there are few films that deal with it in detail. ""Our Flags Lead Us Forward"" (1933) is a Nazi propaganda film about a Nazi Youth martyr. ""Blood and Honor"" was a 1982 German TV series. ""The Hitler Youth"" is a 1999 British documentary. ""Before the Fall"" (2004) shows how entering the Hitler Youth movement changes a young boxer.Bottom line - the film is a little dated and the portrait of small town America is a bit idealized, but this melodrama works even if it is a little heavy handed, mostly from the excellent acting.",3,Good acting and a neglected subject,1367539200,"05 3, 2013",2013,3752,"['Tomorrow', 'World', '1944', 'black', 'white', 'political', 'drama', 'based', 'popular', '1943', 'play', 'same', 'name', 'one', 'few', 'films', 'deal', 'Hitler', 'Youth.The', 'great', 'Frederic', 'March', 'head', 'American', 'family', 'who', 'adopt', 'German', 'nephew', 'who', 'was', 'raised', 'Hitler', 'Youth', 'March', 'won', 'Oscar', 'Dr.', 'Jekyll', 'Mr.', 'Hyde', '1931', 'Best', 'Years', 'Lives', '1946', 'earned', 'three', 'more', 'nominations', 'won', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'Death', 'Salesman', '1951', 'earned', 'two', 'more', 'nominations', 'won', 'two', 'Tonys', 'Years', 'Ago', 'Long', 'Days', 'Journey', 'Into', 'Night', 'appeared', 'more', '50', 'films', '1921', '1973', 'Personally', 'think', 'best', 'performance', 'was', 'Matthew', 'Brady', 'Inherit', 'Wind', '1960', '.Betty', 'Field', '1916-73', 'co-stars', 'March', 'Jewish', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'fine', 'job', ""n't"", 'steal', 'film', 'did', 'Kings', 'Row', '1942', 'Shepherd', 'Hills', '1941', 'Field', 'best', 'remembered', 'body', 'work', 'Broadway', 'made', 'more', 'dozen', 'films', 'including', 'Mae', 'Mice', 'Men', '1939', 'played', 'Nellie', 'Peyton', 'Place', '1957', '.Agnes', 'Morehead', '1900-74', 'March', 'sister', 'earned', 'Academy', 'Award', 'nomination', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actress', 'four', 'times', 'Magnificent', 'Ambersons', 'Hush', 'Hush', 'Sweet', 'Charlotte', 'Johnny', 'Belinda', 'Mrs', 'Parkington', '6', 'Emmy', 'nominations', 'role', 'Bewitched', 'win', 'role', 'Wild', 'Wild', 'West', '1965', 'also', 'won', 'two', 'Golden', 'Globes.Skippy', 'Homeier', '1930', 'boy', 'Homeier', 'one', 'few', 'make', 'transition', 'child', 'actor', 'playing', 'adult', 'roles', 'started', 'career', 'radio', 'then', 'Broadway', '1943', 'played', '14', 'year', 'old', 'Nazi', 'Tomorrow', 'World', 'made', 'film', 'debut', 'here', 'Gunfighter', '1950', 'was', 'first', 'young', 'adult', 'roles', 'followed', 'appearances', 'Halls', 'Montezuma', '1950', 'Fixed', 'Bayonets', '1951', 'Last', 'Posse', '1953', 'became', 'active', 'TV', 'early', '50s', 'appeared', 'several', 'series', 'Dan', 'Raven', 'Interns', '.Joan', 'Carroll', '1932', 'show', 'March', 'spunky', 'daughter', 'made', 'dozen', 'films', 'probably', 'best', 'known', 'Judy', 'Garland', 'younger', 'sister', 'Meet', 'St', 'Louis', '1944', 'film', 'director', 'English', 'born', 'Leslie', 'Fenton', '1902-78', 'was', 'busy', 'actor', '20s', '30s', 'then', 'turned', 'directing', 'mostly', 'B', 'westerns', 'Man', 'Dakota', 'Whispering', 'Smith', 'Streets', 'Laredo', '.The', 'depiction', 'life', 'small', 'town', 'America', 'bit', 'idealized', 'including', 'how', 'naturally', 'Jewish', 'Betty', 'Field', 'going', 'marry', 'Christian', 'Frederic', 'March', 'optimistic', 'ending', 'little', 'too', 'quickly', 'little', 'too', 'neatly', 'be', 'considered', 'biography', 'Moreover', 'not', 'really', 'clear', 'why', 'well', 'indoctrinated', 'Hitler', 'Youth', 'being', 'sent', 'U.S.', 'when', 'could', 'be', 'used', 'war', 'effort-', '1944', 'Germany', 'sorely', 'needed', 'strapping', '14', 'year', 'old', 'fact', 'as', 'early', '1943', 'Hitler', 'Youth', 'had', 'been', 'converted', 'military', 'units.Variety', 'called', 'vivid', 'story', 'said', 'main', 'accolade', 'must', 'go', 'Skippy', 'Homeier', 'Classic', 'Film', 'Guide', 'called', 'above', 'average', 'drama', 'compelling', 'performance', 'Skip', 'Homeier', '.Many', 'films', 'WW', '2', 'include', 'scene', 'two', 'member', 'Hitler', 'Youth', 'e.g.', 'Cabaret', 'Bridge', 'are', 'few', 'films', 'deal', 'detail', 'Flags', 'Lead', 'Us', 'Forward', '1933', 'Nazi', 'propaganda', 'film', 'Nazi', 'Youth', 'martyr', 'Blood', 'Honor', 'was', '1982', 'German', 'TV', 'series', 'Hitler', 'Youth', '1999', 'British', 'documentary', 'Fall', '2004', 'how', 'entering', 'Hitler', 'Youth', 'movement', 'young', 'boxer.Bottom', 'line', 'film', 'little', 'dated', 'portrait', 'small', 'town', 'America', 'bit', 'idealized', 'melodrama', 'even', 'little', 'heavy', 'handed', 'mostly', 'excellent', 'acting']",N/A

True, he doesn't actually kill anybody during the course of the 82-minute running time, but anyone who would hurl racial epithets at sweet Betty Field or crack little Joan Carroll (of &quot;Meet Me in St. Louis&quot; and &quot;Bells of St. Mary's&quot; fame) over the head with a poker in the name of &quot;duty&quot; is clearly capable of just about anything.  I had always wanted to see this movie because Fredric March is one of my favorite actors, but although Mr. March is of course sincere and admirable in his role, the real attraction here is the mesmerizingly manic performance of Skippy Homeier as the menacing and manipulative little storm trooper.  His &quot;reformation&quot; at the end is a little abrupt and not entirely convincing, but that's more the fault of the writers than of the amazing Master Homeier.  As for the DVD quality, the print of the film definitely shows some wear, but at least the picture is sharp and there are no &quot;jumps&quot; or missing bits of film that I noticed.  There are no &quot;extras&quot; on the DVD, but in this case I'm just glad that the folks at Image have made this golden oldie available again as they did with &quot;The Story of G.I.

569981,A2R6RA8FRBS608,B000056N94,Matthew G. Sherwin,"[5, 6]","Tomorrow-The World gives us a fine drama with even some thriller aspects set in America during World War II. The plot moves along at a good pace although there are some times when the movie could have been trimmed a bit here and there. The choice to film this movie in black and white will enhance the overall emotional effect it has on its audience.The action begins in a ""typical"" American household that isn't actually so typical: wartime scientist Mike Frame (Fredric March) is about to marry his Jewish girlfriend Leona Richards (Betty Field). Mike has a daughter, Pat (Joan Carroll), presumably from a previous marriage and they have a German-American housekeeper as well. Just when everything looked rather rosy right before Mike and Leona's wedding, in comes Emil Bruckner (Skippy Homeier), a young 11 year old boy from Germany who is Mike's nephew.And that's where trouble quickly starts. Emil has been brainwashed by the Nazi party in Germany that his father was a traitor and that all Americans will inevitably be conquered by Hitler's regime. Emil starts upsetting people the first day he arrives by coming downstairs for lunch in a Nazi uniform complete with swas****. Emil soon alienates the other children at school; and Emil tries desperately to ruin his uncle Mike's plans to marry the Jewish Leona Richards.Some people believe that to some degree this is a propaganda film. Yes, there is indeed an undercurrent of that flavor. The American family is remarkably pure and civilized--they don't believe in beating children (which still happened plenty in 1944, the year this film was made); and marriage between a Jew and a Christian seems not to bother anyone. Naturally, in 1944 mainstream America might not have approved of such a marriage. The striking proof that this is an unusually progressive family comes when Emil notices that Mike's daughter Pat calls her father by his first name! Now THAT'S not so common even in OUR times! Of course, the Nazi child Emil has blond hair and blue eyes; a rather mean stare on his face; and he wants to cause as much heartache as he can for the Americans in order to honor Hitler.Emil Bruckner (Skippy Homeier) truly DOES steal the show with his excellent, convincing acting--and the ending scenes with Emil once again prove his competence as a fine actor. Fredric March turns in a great performance as Mike Frame who tries so hard along with the other Americans to be patient while Emil ""adjusts"" to American life--even though his ""adjustment"" and de-brainwashing remains highly in doubt at many times throughout the picture.Actualy, there's much more to the plot but I hate to put in too many spoilers--just get this film and watch it! They did a great job with the cinematography; and the choreography shines in crowded classroom scenes and other scenes that are designed to have an emotional impact on the viewer.In short, Tomorrow-The World represents a great period piece about the Nazis and the Americans who want to help Germany overthrow and overcome its domination by an evil dictator. The fine acting holds your attention even if at times they could have left a little bit more on the cutting room floor. The incredibly pure and good Americans want so desperately to change Emil for the better they come off looking like Saints even though they have their occasional human frailties!I highly recommend this film for World War II buffs and anyone who cares to enjoy a fine drama about people as they cope with the strife caused by that war. Fans of Fredric March and Agnes Moorehead will enjoy seeing their idols on the screen; and the children's acting remains very impressive to this day.",4,fine wartime drama with a political slant,1185753600,"07 30, 2007",2007,3659,"['Tomorrow-The', 'World', 'fine', 'drama', 'even', 'thriller', 'aspects', 'set', 'America', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'plot', 'along', 'good', 'pace', 'are', 'times', 'when', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'trimmed', 'bit', 'here', 'there', 'choice', 'film', 'movie', 'black', 'white', 'will', 'enhance', 'overall', 'emotional', 'effect', 'audience.The', 'action', 'typical', 'American', 'household', ""n't"", 'actually', 'so', 'typical', 'wartime', 'scientist', 'Mike', 'Frame', 'Fredric', 'March', 'marry', 'Jewish', 'girlfriend', 'Leona', 'Richards', 'Betty', 'Field', 'Mike', 'daughter', 'Pat', 'Joan', 'Carroll', 'presumably', 'previous', 'marriage', 'have', 'German-American', 'housekeeper', 'well', 'Just', 'when', 'everything', 'looked', 'rather', 'rosy', 'right', 'Mike', 'Leona', 'wedding', 'Emil', 'Bruckner', 'Skippy', 'Homeier', 'young', '11', 'year', 'old', 'boy', 'Germany', 'who', 'Mike', 'nephew.And', 'where', 'trouble', 'quickly', 'Emil', 'been', 'brainwashed', 'Nazi', 'party', 'Germany', 'father', 'was', 'traitor', 'Americans', 'will', 'inevitably', 'be', 'conquered', 'Hitler', 'regime', 'Emil', 'upsetting', 'people', 'first', 'day', 'coming', 'downstairs', 'lunch', 'Nazi', 'uniform', 'complete', 'swas****', 'Emil', 'soon', 'other', 'children', 'school', 'Emil', 'desperately', 'ruin', 'uncle', 'Mike', 'plans', 'marry', 'Jewish', 'Leona', 'Richards.Some', 'people', 'believe', 'degree', 'propaganda', 'film', 'Yes', 'indeed', 'undercurrent', 'flavor', 'American', 'family', 'remarkably', 'pure', 'civilized', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'beating', 'children', 'still', 'happened', 'plenty', '1944', 'year', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'marriage', 'Jew', 'Christian', 'not', 'bother', 'anyone', 'Naturally', '1944', 'mainstream', 'America', 'might', 'not', 'have', 'approved', 'such', 'marriage', 'striking', 'proof', 'unusually', 'progressive', 'family', 'when', 'Emil', 'Mike', 'daughter', 'Pat', 'father', 'first', 'name', 'Now', 'THAT', 'not', 'so', 'common', 'even', 'OUR', 'times', 'course', 'Nazi', 'child', 'Emil', 'blond', 'hair', 'blue', 'eyes', 'rather', 'mean', 'stare', 'face', 'cause', 'much', 'heartache', 'can', 'Americans', 'order', 'honor', 'Hitler.Emil', 'Bruckner', 'Skippy', 'Homeier', 'truly', 'DOES', 'steal', 'show', 'excellent', 'convincing', 'acting', 'ending', 'scenes', 'Emil', 'once', 'again', 'prove', 'competence', 'fine', 'actor', 'Fredric', 'March', 'great', 'performance', 'Mike', 'Frame', 'who', 'so', 'hard', 'other', 'Americans', 'be', 'patient', 'Emil', 'adjusts', 'American', 'life', 'even', 'adjustment', 'de-brainwashing', 'remains', 'highly', 'doubt', 'many', 'times', 'picture.Actualy', 'much', 'more', 'plot', 'hate', 'put', 'too', 'many', 'spoilers', 'just', 'get', 'film', 'watch', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'cinematography', 'choreography', 'shines', 'crowded', 'classroom', 'scenes', 'other', 'scenes', 'are', 'designed', 'have', 'emotional', 'impact', 'viewer.In', 'short', 'Tomorrow-The', 'World', 'great', 'period', 'piece', 'Nazis', 'Americans', 'who', 'want', 'help', 'Germany', 'overthrow', 'overcome', 'domination', 'evil', 'dictator', 'fine', 'acting', 'attention', 'even', 'times', 'could', 'have', 'left', 'little', 'bit', 'more', 'cutting', 'room', 'floor', 'incredibly', 'pure', 'good', 'Americans', 'want', 'so', 'desperately', 'change', 'Emil', 'better', 'come', 'looking', 'Saints', 'even', 'have', 'occasional', 'human', 'frailties', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'buffs', 'anyone', 'who', 'enjoy', 'fine', 'drama', 'about', 'people', 'cope', 'strife', 'caused', 'war', 'Fans', 'Fredric', 'March', 'Agnes', 'Moorehead', 'will', 'enjoy', 'seeing', 'idols', 'screen', 'children', 'acting', 'very', 'impressive', 'day']",N/A
569982,A1SVXJZ3386U2D,B000056N94,Randy Keehn,"[2, 11]","I watched this movie the other day because I noticed that it starred Fredric March.  He's made some pretty good movies over the years in large part because he's a very good actor.  I didn't recognize any of the rest of the cast but the plot synopsis looked somewhat interesting.  As I watched the movie unfold, I couldn't believe what I was seeing.  This young German boy is brought to America to stay with March (a widower, from what I could gather) because March had been a student of the boy's German father.  The kid makes an immediate bad impression and it goes downhill from there.  This kid is probably how Goebbels would have portrayed an American youth ""rescued"" to Nazi Germany.  He is anti-semitic (March's finace is Jewish, of course), sexist, full of distain for fellow students of ""lesser"" European heritage, etc..  He spys for Hitler and tries to develop a Nazi Youth group after school.  In addition, he violently attacks fellow students under the slightest provocation.  After his arrival he dresses up in a brand new Nazi Youth outfit and is excused by March's fiance because ""the poor kid probably had nothing else to wear"".  It was too much.  The ending was too much as well.  I guess I shouldn't spell it out but see if you would have handled the kid the same way.  If you would, I hope I never live in your neighborhood!I feel that I have a fairly good appreciation of WWII era movies and cartoons.  I appreciate the not-so-subtle propaganda for what it was intended.  Stereotypes abound in such media and that's easy to understand; there need be no confusion at home as to who is the good guy and who is the bad guy.  However, ""Tomorrow the World"" can't hide its' mediocrity behind purposeful propaganda.  This movie is so outlandish that no excuse can justify it.I noticed references to the movie ""The Bad Seed"" in some of the reviews.  I admit that the image of Patty McCormick came to mind while I watched ""Tomorrow the World"".  I don't buy the comparison even though it came to mind.  ""The Bad Seed"" was a psychological exploration of the origin of evil.  It had a legitimate proposition whether you agree with it or not.  Comparing that movie to ""Tomorrow the World"" is like comparing Shakespeare to the Bowery Boys.  I understand that there is an element of some legitimacy in the movie.  It has to do with how does good handle evil.  However, putting other innocent children at risk is not the answer.  If ""Tomorrow the World"" has any redeeming value, it would be that it is so bad that it may develop some sort of cult following.  Apparently it may already have done so.",2,Preview of the Marshall Plan?,1131494400,"11 9, 2005",2005,2601,"['watched', 'movie', 'other', 'day', 'noticed', 'starred', 'Fredric', 'March', 'made', 'pretty', 'good', 'movies', 'years', 'large', 'part', 'very', 'good', 'actor', 'did', ""n't"", 'recognize', 'rest', 'cast', 'plot', 'synopsis', 'looked', 'somewhat', 'interesting', 'watched', 'movie', 'unfold', 'could', ""n't"", 'believe', 'what', 'was', 'seeing', 'young', 'German', 'boy', 'brought', 'America', 'stay', 'March', 'widower', 'what', 'could', 'gather', 'March', 'had', 'been', 'student', 'boy', 'German', 'father', 'kid', 'immediate', 'bad', 'impression', 'downhill', 'there', 'kid', 'probably', 'how', 'Goebbels', 'would', 'have', 'portrayed', 'American', 'youth', 'rescued', 'Nazi', 'Germany', 'anti-semitic', 'March', 'finace', 'Jewish', 'course', 'sexist', 'full', 'distain', 'fellow', 'students', 'lesser', 'European', 'heritage', 'Hitler', 'tries', 'develop', 'Nazi', 'Youth', 'group', 'school', 'addition', 'violently', 'fellow', 'students', 'slightest', 'provocation', 'arrival', 'up', 'brand', 'new', 'Nazi', 'Youth', 'outfit', 'excused', 'March', 'fiance', 'poor', 'kid', 'probably', 'had', 'nothing', 'else', 'wear', 'was', 'too', 'much', 'ending', 'was', 'too', 'much', 'well', 'guess', 'should', ""n't"", 'spell', 'out', 'see', 'would', 'have', 'handled', 'kid', 'same', 'way', 'would', 'hope', 'never', 'live', 'neighborhood', 'feel', 'have', 'fairly', 'good', 'appreciation', 'WWII', 'era', 'movies', 'cartoons', 'appreciate', 'not-so-subtle', 'propaganda', 'what', 'was', 'intended', 'Stereotypes', 'such', 'media', 'easy', 'understand', 'need', 'be', 'confusion', 'home', 'who', 'good', 'guy', 'who', 'bad', 'guy', 'However', 'Tomorrow', 'World', 'ca', ""n't"", 'hide', 'mediocrity', 'purposeful', 'propaganda', 'movie', 'so', 'outlandish', 'excuse', 'can', 'justify', 'it.I', 'noticed', 'references', 'movie', 'Bad', 'Seed', 'reviews', 'admit', 'image', 'Patty', 'McCormick', 'came', 'mind', 'watched', 'Tomorrow', 'World', 'do', ""n't"", 'buy', 'comparison', 'even', 'came', 'mind', 'Bad', 'Seed', 'was', 'psychological', 'exploration', 'origin', 'evil', 'had', 'legitimate', 'proposition', 'agree', 'not', 'Comparing', 'movie', 'Tomorrow', 'World', 'comparing', 'Shakespeare', 'Bowery', 'Boys', 'understand', 'element', 'legitimacy', 'movie', 'do', 'how', 'good', 'handle', 'evil', 'However', 'putting', 'other', 'innocent', 'children', 'risk', 'not', 'answer', 'Tomorrow', 'World', 'redeeming', 'value', 'would', 'be', 'so', 'bad', 'may', 'develop', 'sort', 'cult', 'following', 'Apparently', 'may', 'already', 'have', 'done', 'so']",N/A
