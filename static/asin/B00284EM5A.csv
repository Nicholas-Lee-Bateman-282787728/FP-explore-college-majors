It was honestly like nothing I had ever watched before and once I began watching it, I couldn't stop. I had to watch the movie, OVAs, and read the manga.I know the drawing style is odd, but hey, it's CLAMP. I know the main character is not what you're used to, but that's what is so fresh about it. Kimihiro Watanuki is a silly boy, but he finds himself entangled in a world that was always around, but never quite understood. As he enters this shop of wishes, he begins to learn and grow. He may seem silly, but there are many things within him that you will learn along the way that he hides beneath his smile, but he grows and he learns to love those in his life and he learns to find his place within this world he has discovered.xxxHolic gives many life lessons and is very insightful, after each episode, you will be left thinking about it and find yourself marked by this wonderful anime.

1255069,A30JPZ9TZ7I61U,B00284EM5A,"Christopher Barrett ""Evil Corgi""","[0, 0]","I'll just add on to the other positive reviews.This is a pretty good anime series, and for under $20 a fantastic deal.  Luckily my local library has this set, so I was able to check it out and watch for free (yay me!).It's a supernatural thriller with a lot of comedic overtones.  It's not as serious as Ghost Hunt or some of the other supernatural series, but it still has nice spooky undertones.  The comedy is what makes this enjoyable.  The characters are all fun and very interesting and their interactions get more complex and funnier as the series continues.  Not to say this is a 'ghost story' type of anime.  This series includes references to old Japanese lore and mythology such as pipe foxes and such.Basically Watanuki is an orphaned high school kid who sees spirits.  He stumbles into a mysterious house where the resident asks him to make a wish in exchange for a payment.  He agrees, wishing to no longer be chased by spirits (or so we think that's his wish...), but in exchange he has to work part time for the mistress.  Add a weird Mokona creature, two homonculi girls, and a couple of school friends and you have a fun and diverse mix of characters.  It's even more amusing watching the little Mokona drink insane amounts of beer, sake, and liquor.Most of the episodes can be watched as stand alone, but the story does have a light progression from beginning to ending.  But going back and watching one or two episodes or even missing an episode or two won't leave you in the dark.The series finishes with a couple of more serious and somber episodes (23 and 24).  But overall the entire series has a positive vibe.  The 25th episode is an extra 'side story' episode that sheds a little light on Watanuki's past.It's a nice addition to the SAVE series and a series that didn't receive a huge amount of notice in the states.  I recommend it to a variety of anime fans who like upbeat series with a serious story at its core.  Fans of series from Tenchi to Ghost Hunt to Welcome to the NHK will enjoy this.Update:I have been reading the manga and the companion guide to the manga.  Wow, they really toned down the violence in the anime.  In the manga, several people (not the main people) actually meet grisly ends.  For example, the woman who lied and had the black aura actually dies when struck by the vehicle in the manga, but ends up hospitalized in the anime.  Though the monkey paw story ends up the same!  So don't expect this to be too graphic if you read the manga first.",4,Hmmmm...

Now I know that most series like this always portray the main guy as a completely obtuse, insensitive, whiney and clueless moron where girls and relationships are concerned but in this series they take the main male lead way over the top.He is not only oblivious and insecure about his own masculinity, personal worth, girls and relationships, but he also always reacts like a screaming...no make that screeching, overwrought drama queen who screams and shrieks like a hysterical woman over every stupid misconception or misunderstanding his limited intellect comes up with.  That alone makes this series unwatchable for me as his all too frequent hysterical, screaming outbursts are like nails being dragged across a blackboard.The artwork was also a disappointment. The style is more like caricatures with the worst thing being the way Watanuki's character squirms and shimmies like a serpent every time he has one of his many hysterical screaming attacks.It's unfortunate because the plot and storyline are really great.

Domeki, however, seems more focused on keeping Watanuki in one piece than hitting on Himawari...So begins Watanuki's journey to end his problem and, because he's a very good person, try to help some of the other customers who come to Yuko's shop - if he doesn't get himself killed first.The first thing that fans of the Holic manga will notice is that some of the events have been switched around in the anime, which might disorient them a bit but isn't really a huge problem at this point, as the story doesn't start to become too linear yet (it does beginning with the events presumably covered by the as yet unlicensed second season).  They'll also notice that all references to what is concurrently happening to the Tsubasa gang have been cut (Tsubasa fans will recognize Watanuki from his brief cameo at the very beginning of Tsubasa), and the Warashi girls have been added to enough scenes to upgrade them to borderline recurring characters rather than guest stars.  As with the Holic movie (A Midsummer Night's Dream), the English dub is particularly strong.  Sometimes the stars align, and Todd Haberkorn pretty much nails how I heard Watanuki in my head while reading the manga: making us laugh when he goes into houseboy mode, want to slap him upside the head when he's horrid to Domeki, and breaking our hearts in the final stories of this season.  His co-star Colleen Clinkenbeard equals him with a pitch-perfect, sultry Yuko; and J. Michael Tatum does fine as Domeki, who is arguably the most difficult character in the series to voice as a boy who's just as good and feels just as deeply as Watanuki but tends to show it in actions rather than words.  Even minor characters are voiced extremely well.All in all, I can heartily recommend this to Holic fans and anyone else who wants to try a supernatural tale.",4,Careful what you wish for,1249084800,"08 1, 2009",2009,2791,"['Kimihiro', 'Watanuki', 'all-around', 'nice', 'guy', 'who', 'would', 'give', 'anyone', 'shirt', 'back', 'Unfortunately', 'life', 'often', ""n't"", 'fair', 'addition', 'being', 'orphan', 'plagued', 'having', 'aura', 'often', 'malicious', 'creatures', 'spirit', 'world', 'ability', 'protect', 'One', 'day', 'shop', 'mysterious', 'all-powerful', 'witch', 'Yuko', 'who', 'basically', 'indentured', 'servant', 'period', 'time', ""'ll"", 'give', 'solution', 'problem', 'Watanuki', 'reached', 'point', 'where', 'just', 'become', 'desperate', 'enough', 'agree.Yuko', 'solution', 'Watanuki', 'seek', 'out', 'schoolmate', 'Domeki', 'calm', 'collected', 'star', 'school', 'archery', 'team', 'who', 'just', 'so', 'be', 'natural', 'exorcist', 'incidentally', 'one', 'person', 'Watanuki', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'due', 'insane', 'jealousy', 'largely', 'stemming', 'Domeki', 'being', 'friendly', 'terms', 'Watanuki', 'crush', 'lovely', 'sunny', 'Himawari', 'Domeki', 'however', 'more', 'focused', 'keeping', 'Watanuki', 'one', 'piece', 'hitting', 'Himawari', 'So', 'Watanuki', 'journey', 'end', 'problem', 'very', 'good', 'person', 'try', 'help', 'other', 'customers', 'who', 'come', 'Yuko', 'shop', ""n't"", 'get', 'killed', 'first.The', 'first', 'thing', 'fans', 'Holic', 'manga', 'will', 'notice', 'events', 'have', 'been', 'switched', 'anime', 'might', 'disorient', 'bit', ""n't"", 'really', 'huge', 'problem', 'point', 'story', ""n't"", 'start', 'become', 'too', 'linear', 'yet', 'beginning', 'events', 'presumably', 'covered', 'yet', 'unlicensed', 'second', 'season', ""'ll"", 'also', 'notice', 'references', 'what', 'concurrently', 'happening', 'Tsubasa', 'gang', 'have', 'been', 'cut', 'Tsubasa', 'fans', 'will', 'recognize', 'Watanuki', 'brief', 'cameo', 'very', 'beginning', 'Tsubasa', 'Warashi', 'girls', 'have', 'been', 'added', 'enough', 'scenes', 'upgrade', 'borderline', 'recurring', 'characters', 'rather', 'guest', 'stars', 'Holic', 'movie', 'Midsummer', 'Night', 'Dream', 'English', 'dub', 'particularly', 'strong', 'Sometimes', 'stars', 'align', 'Todd', 'Haberkorn', 'pretty', 'much', 'how', 'heard', 'Watanuki', 'head', 'reading', 'manga', 'making', 'when', 'houseboy', 'mode', 'want', 'slap', 'upside', 'head', 'when', 'horrid', 'Domeki', 'breaking', 'hearts', 'final', 'stories', 'season', 'co-star', 'Colleen', 'Clinkenbeard', 'pitch-perfect', 'sultry', 'Yuko', 'J.', 'Michael', 'Tatum', 'fine', 'Domeki', 'who', 'arguably', 'most', 'difficult', 'character', 'series', 'voice', 'boy', 'who', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'feels', 'just', 'as', 'deeply', 'Watanuki', 'show', 'actions', 'rather', 'words', 'Even', 'minor', 'characters', 'are', 'voiced', 'extremely', 'well.All', 'can', 'heartily', 'recommend', 'Holic', 'fans', 'anyone', 'else', 'who', 'try', 'supernatural', 'tale']",N/A

The stories themselves I won't get into, but they're a lot of fun to watch if you're into that kind of thing)One of the biggest strengths of xxxHolic for me is undoubtedly the characters.  It was my first exposure to both Colleen Clinkenbeard and Todd Haberkorn, and both of them did, in my opinion (I was already familiar with the manga), an excellent job of portraying the two star characters of the anime, whom I was already familiar with from the manga.  The dynamic between Yuuko and Watanuki is wonderfully played out here.  It's an all too uncommon occurrence where the dub cast really shines in their roles, though there's always the option of subtitles.  It's unfortunate they may never get to reprise their roles if the rest of the series is never brought over.Yes, unfortunately the xxxHolic anime at this point shows no indication of ever being localized in it's entirety, despite the existence of a second 13 episode season and one or more OVAs.  This collection here however contains the bulk of the content already produced, and is itself a fairly self-contained story in it's own right.

Watanuki is a teen who's haunted by ghost-people and they rarely leave him alone, following him everywhere. One day, his attempts to escape them lead him to an ornate shop owned by the witch Yuki who already seems to know Watanuki's problem. She can cure him, she says, but for a price. In the meantime, she hires him as a cook, bottlewasher, and errand boy for her and her odd assortment of friends and servants...a pair of androgynous twins and a furry rabbit-like creature. Apparently Watanuki is now more or less her slave until she decides to rid him of his ghosts because he never makes any attempt to leave. In the meantime, he witnesses many strange goings-on as Yuki &#34;cures&#34; others and has a few more adventures when he discovers his best friend  has supernatural problems and finds a girl also visited by ghosts.Odd but entertaining, it took a bit getting used to since these characters are so weird. Nevertheless, once I got into the right frame of mind, I found these just as entertaining and unsettling as watching a Twilight Zone or Night Gallery episode. The switching of a character's features to show various emotions was a little off-putting, however.  All in all, a good series and I'm glad I bought it.",5,Odd but Entertaining,1396656000,"04 5, 2014",2014,1480,"['Watching', 'anime', 'involving', 'teenagers', 'always', 'wonder', 'how', 'accurate', 'portrayals', 'are', 'teens', 'always', 'live', 'go', 'school', 'have', 'jobs', 'rarely', 'are', 'adults', 'supervise', 'one', 'different', 'Watanuki', 'teen', 'who', 'haunted', 'ghost-people', 'rarely', 'leave', 'alone', 'following', 'everywhere', 'One', 'day', 'attempts', 'escape', 'lead', 'ornate', 'shop', 'owned', 'witch', 'Yuki', 'who', 'already', 'know', 'Watanuki', 'problem', 'can', 'cure', 'price', 'meantime', 'cook', 'bottlewasher', 'errand', 'boy', 'odd', 'assortment', 'friends', 'servants', 'pair', 'androgynous', 'twins', 'furry', 'rabbit-like', 'creature', 'Apparently', 'Watanuki', 'now', 'more', 'less', 'slave', 'rid', 'ghosts', 'never', 'attempt', 'leave', 'meantime', 'many', 'strange', 'goings-on', 'Yuki', '34', 'cures', '34', 'others', 'few', 'more', 'adventures', 'when', 'best', 'friend', 'supernatural', 'problems', 'girl', 'also', 'visited', 'ghosts.Odd', 'entertaining', 'took', 'bit', 'getting', 'used', 'characters', 'are', 'so', 'weird', 'Nevertheless', 'once', 'got', 'right', 'frame', 'mind', 'found', 'just', 'entertaining', 'unsettling', 'watching', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'Night', 'Gallery', 'episode', 'switching', 'character', 'features', 'show', 'various', 'emotions', 'was', 'little', 'off-putting', 'however', 'good', 'series', ""'m"", 'glad', 'bought']",N/A

1255101,A35DKEXMX6P22R,B00284EM5A,W. Wooard,"[1, 1]",This anime surprised me because of the subject matter they use in this anime to explore the creepy and darkside of human behavior. What are the real consequences to our actions as we go into each day. What is right and what wrong of what we do and say and how it affects others around us. The artist who drew the anime and wrote the materieal seemed to take care and tried their best to make the viewer think on life. Even got me to laugh at the characters in the story as they matured and gained understanding about daily life. Enjoyed this anime along with the shadows and lights that seemed drive the characters moods and the use of different colors to illustrate different moods the characters were going through.
