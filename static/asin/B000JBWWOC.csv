1025426,A2MLZGXFCBEVSW,B000JBWWOC,Charles W. Paige,"[6, 6]","My opinion of The Waltons series is 99.9% on the positive side, so first I'll mention a slightly negative aspect encountered with the series, namely very slight inconsistencies with an otherwise strong and diverse story line. The only examples I can think of--which says much for such a long-running series--were found between season 1's The Star, season 2's The Awakening, and season 3's The Statue. The closing monologue in season 2's The Awakening has John-Boy reminiscing about Mary Ellen's adult life and the fact she had married a university professor and was the mother of two boys, whereas in later seasons she was married to doctors and, in one episode, was injured, keeping her from having any more children than son John Curtis. The other inconsistency had to do with Grandpa Walton's requested gravesite on the side of Walton's Mountain in season 1's The Star, and season 3's projected gravesite in The Statue. In the latter episode Grandpa and Grandma had an argument over the placement of a statue Grandpa had won in a raffle. He wanted it placed over their future burial site in a local cemetery, which was located on flat land surrounded by shady trees. However, after Grandpa's death--made necessary due to actor Will Geer's actual death--whenever they showed his burial place it was on a sunny slope of Walton's mountain, which had been requested in season 1's The Star. To me these were niggling things that pointed out the importance of thinking through, planning, and maintaining a story line regardless of creative impulses urging otherwise.On the mostly positive side I believe that, as the years and generations pass, the importance of having recorded The Waltons series will become increasingly evident and appreciated, perhaps even studied in the classroom. Earl Hamner's spirit of family life totally infuses the series with a love and family communion almost impossible to achieve these days in real life due to the myriad influences bent on tearing families apart. The longer The Waltons series ran the more these influences began showing themselves within the series itself and, perhaps more poignantly, within the lives of the actors who played the roles. I seriously doubt it would be possible to recreate the series today, so the fact that it exists at all, and can easily be obtained, should be a boon to future generations. It will be there for anyone who feels a need to expose others to a family where children loved--and loved being with--their parents, grandparents, and each other, were equally loved in return, and were mentored empathetically and in healthy directions by honorable and honored members of the older generation.On a personal level, I'm not sure how my life would have turned out if it hadn't been for exposure to The Waltons, even if only through TV. Coming from a typical, modern, dysfunctional family, complete with paternal infidelity, divorce, and a parade of stepmothers, I needed this vicarious relationship with a family much closer to the idyllic norm. The Waltons not only exposed me to familial love and mutual cooperation/sensitivity that was hard to find at home, but also encouraged my love of writing, which, perhaps not too surprisingly, has found vent in stories about relatives and histories of my ancestors, where I've occasionally found people like the Waltons in my own family tree.",5,The Surrogate Family,1173744000,"03 13, 2007",2007,3359,"['opinion', 'Waltons', 'series', '99.9', '%', 'positive', 'side', 'first', ""'ll"", 'mention', 'slightly', 'negative', 'aspect', 'encountered', 'series', 'namely', 'very', 'slight', 'inconsistencies', 'otherwise', 'strong', 'diverse', 'story', 'line', 'only', 'can', 'think', 'much', 'such', 'long-running', 'series', 'were', 'found', 'season', '1', 'Star', 'season', '2', 'Awakening', 'season', '3', 'Statue', 'closing', 'monologue', 'season', '2', 'Awakening', 'John-Boy', 'reminiscing', 'Mary', 'Ellen', 'adult', 'life', 'fact', 'had', 'married', 'university', 'professor', 'was', 'mother', 'two', 'boys', 'whereas', 'later', 'seasons', 'was', 'married', 'doctors', 'one', 'episode', 'was', 'injured', 'keeping', 'having', 'more', 'children', 'son', 'John', 'Curtis', 'other', 'inconsistency', 'had', 'do', 'Grandpa', 'Walton', 'requested', 'gravesite', 'side', 'Walton', 'Mountain', 'season', '1', 'Star', 'season', '3', 'projected', 'gravesite', 'Statue', 'latter', 'episode', 'Grandpa', 'Grandma', 'had', 'argument', 'placement', 'statue', 'Grandpa', 'had', 'won', 'raffle', 'wanted', 'placed', 'future', 'burial', 'site', 'local', 'cemetery', 'was', 'located', 'flat', 'land', 'surrounded', 'shady', 'trees', 'However', 'Grandpa', 'death', 'made', 'necessary', 'due', 'actor', 'Will', 'Geer', 'actual', 'death', 'whenever', 'showed', 'burial', 'place', 'was', 'sunny', 'slope', 'Walton', 'mountain', 'had', 'been', 'requested', 'season', '1', 'Star', 'were', 'niggling', 'things', 'pointed', 'out', 'importance', 'thinking', 'planning', 'maintaining', 'story', 'line', 'regardless', 'creative', 'impulses', 'urging', 'mostly', 'positive', 'side', 'believe', 'that', 'years', 'generations', 'pass', 'importance', 'having', 'recorded', 'Waltons', 'series', 'will', 'become', 'increasingly', 'evident', 'appreciated', 'perhaps', 'even', 'studied', 'classroom', 'Earl', 'Hamner', 'spirit', 'family', 'life', 'totally', 'series', 'love', 'family', 'communion', 'almost', 'impossible', 'achieve', 'days', 'real', 'life', 'due', 'myriad', 'influences', 'bent', 'tearing', 'families', 'apart', 'longer', 'Waltons', 'series', 'ran', 'more', 'influences', 'began', 'showing', 'series', 'perhaps', 'more', 'poignantly', 'lives', 'actors', 'who', 'played', 'roles', 'seriously', 'doubt', 'would', 'be', 'possible', 'recreate', 'series', 'today', 'fact', 'can', 'easily', 'be', 'obtained', 'should', 'be', 'boon', 'future', 'generations', 'will', 'be', 'there', 'anyone', 'who', 'need', 'expose', 'others', 'family', 'where', 'children', 'loved', 'loved', 'being', 'parents', 'grandparents', 'other', 'were', 'equally', 'loved', 'return', 'were', 'mentored', 'empathetically', 'healthy', 'directions', 'honorable', 'honored', 'members', 'older', 'generation.On', 'personal', 'level', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'life', 'would', 'have', 'turned', 'out', 'had', ""n't"", 'been', 'exposure', 'Waltons', 'even', 'only', 'TV', 'Coming', 'typical', 'modern', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'complete', 'paternal', 'infidelity', 'divorce', 'parade', 'stepmothers', 'needed', 'vicarious', 'relationship', 'family', 'much', 'closer', 'idyllic', 'norm', 'Waltons', 'not', 'only', 'exposed', 'familial', 'love', 'mutual', 'cooperation/sensitivity', 'was', 'hard', 'find', 'home', 'also', 'encouraged', 'love', 'writing', 'perhaps', 'not', 'too', 'surprisingly', 'found', 'vent', 'stories', 'relatives', 'histories', 'ancestors', 'where', ""'ve"", 'occasionally', 'found', 'people', 'Waltons', 'own', 'family', 'tree']",The Waltons: Season 4

This show was still in its element in season four. My favorite season happens to be season five because there are some great shows involving the central character of John-Boy, including his newspaper article on ""Mein Kampf"" which turns the community upside down, and the Hindenburg story as well. He also achieves his goal of having his novel published in the last episode of season five. For those who think the show is not worth watching after this, remember that Richard Thomas returns in season six for three episodes near the end of the season and the final show of season six is ""Grandma Comes Home,"" which is also Will Geer's last appearance, as he died shortly after this episode aired. I gave this set four stars instead of five, because I noticed a cut scene in ""The Fledgling."" In the original airing John-Boy, overworked, falls asleep in class and Professor Parks speaks with him afterwards. In the DVD, it cuts right to Professor Parks talking to him so I don't know if they had a bad tape or what happened, but I sure hope no other episodes were trimmed. At any rate, ""The Waltons"" is still loved and its loyal fans recently convinced The Hallmark Chanel to air the show again after it was briefly taken off.

Eldest son John-Boy, now a sophomore at Boatwright College, is a stringer for a local newspaper.Second eldest son Jason, always musically gifted, has won a scholarship to study music. Meanwhile, eldest daughter Mary Ellen plans to study nursing after graduating from high school this year, while the younger children also follow their own individual pursuits.Possibly the most memorable episode of Season 4 is ""The Burnout,"" a two-hour special featuring a fire that ravages the Walton home, and the devastating aftermath -- both physical and emotional -- as the family struggles to rebuild their previous existence.Other key episodes include ""The Sermon,"" where John-Boy is asked to be a guest speaker at church while the Rev. Fordwick is away on his honeymoon, and mother Olivia subs at the school in place of his wife, the former Miss Hunter. In ""The Prophecy,"" dad John is full of anguish at the approach of his 25th high school reunion, under the delusion that his life is nowhere near as successful as those of his classmates.Although this show is set in the 1930s, the plots and characters' struggles ring as true as if they were happening today. Who among us can't relate to job and financial struggles, whether they be the result of the Depression or downsizing? Who hasn't had dreams and goals of becoming someone successful, just like John-Boy with his writing and Jason with his music?If you've never watched The Waltons, I urge you to start from Season 1.

Since the days of adult-oriented ""Dallas"" and other similar sleazy sex melodramas, the major tv networks have been set on corrupting and ridiculing the strong family values that made America a once-great and proud nation.Thank goodness for The Waltons!  The Waltons is a series that everyone in the family can sit down and enjoy together.  Parents can relax because there is no cursing or foul language, no double-entendre sex jokes, no graphic violence, just real characters growing up in a much more innocent age than we currently live in.  (For a look at how our grandparents grew up, watch the Waltons).In Season Four of the series, 24 episodes are presented, all of them being quality family enertainment.  I have my favorite episodes of season 4 and you will too - there is much to like about this season.  John-boy grows closer to graduation from college and begins a newspaper, Mary-Ellen begins her first steps in her nursing career, Ben grows into a young man with strong ideas of his own, and of course there is always the steady presence of the parents and grandparents, guiding this large family through the trying years of the Great Depression.While my favorite Waltons season is the very first, there is still so much to treasure in this fourth season.  The acting is superb, with Michael Learned winning an Emmy for Outstanding Lead Actress in a drama series, and the perpetually old and cranky Ellen Corby winning an Emmy for supporting actress.  (Does anyone recall Ellen Corby playing anything other than an old lady or Grandma? - I can only recall one role as a pioneering farming homesteader in the movie ""Shane"" ).  Richard Thomas binds this series together, being the person from which the stories are being told.  When Richard Thomas leaves the show after season five, the series loses its central focus.  And while the series still remains entertaining after season five, the loss of John-Boy is imposible to overcome.I heartily recommend Season Four of the Waltons.  It is something your family can watch and learn important life-lessons from, a far-cry from today's tv viewing options.Jim ""Konedog"" Koenig",4,Waltons Series Remains a Classic in TV Viewing,1170028800,"01 29, 2007",2007,2774,"['age', 'innocence', 'long', 'gone', 'America', 'TV', 'grew', 'up', '1960', 'remember', 'days', 'family-friendly', 'television', 'Remember', 'great', 'family', 'shows', 'member', 'family', 'could', 'enjoy', 'Andy', 'Griffith', 'Show', 'Dick', 'Van', 'Dyke', 'Show', 'That', 'Girl', 'Father', 'Knows', 'Best', 'Leave', 'Beaver', 'Ozzie', 'Harriet', 'few', 'family-friendly', 'shows', 'remained', '1970', 'Partridge', 'Family', 'Brady', 'Bunch', 'best', 'Waltons', 'Waltons', 'left', 'TV', 'early', '1980', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'few', 'quality', 'tv', 'entire', 'family', 'can', 'watch', 'enjoy', 'together', 'Wonder', 'Years', 'out', 'one', 'days', 'adult-oriented', 'Dallas', 'other', 'similar', 'sleazy', 'sex', 'melodramas', 'major', 'tv', 'networks', 'have', 'been', 'set', 'corrupting', 'ridiculing', 'strong', 'family', 'values', 'made', 'America', 'once-great', 'proud', 'nation.Thank', 'goodness', 'Waltons', 'Waltons', 'series', 'everyone', 'family', 'can', 'sit', 'down', 'enjoy', 'together', 'Parents', 'can', 'relax', 'cursing', 'foul', 'language', 'double-entendre', 'sex', 'jokes', 'graphic', 'violence', 'just', 'real', 'characters', 'growing', 'up', 'much', 'more', 'innocent', 'age', 'currently', 'live', 'look', 'how', 'grandparents', 'grew', 'up', 'watch', 'Waltons', '.In', 'Season', 'Four', 'series', '24', 'episodes', 'are', 'presented', 'being', 'quality', 'family', 'enertainment', 'have', 'favorite', 'episodes', 'season', '4', 'will', 'too', 'much', 'like', 'season', 'John-boy', 'grows', 'closer', 'graduation', 'college', 'newspaper', 'Mary-Ellen', 'first', 'steps', 'nursing', 'career', 'Ben', 'young', 'man', 'strong', 'ideas', 'own', 'course', 'always', 'steady', 'presence', 'parents', 'grandparents', 'guiding', 'large', 'family', 'trying', 'years', 'Great', 'Depression.While', 'favorite', 'Waltons', 'season', 'very', 'first', 'still', 'so', 'much', 'treasure', 'fourth', 'season', 'acting', 'superb', 'Michael', 'Learned', 'winning', 'Emmy', 'Outstanding', 'Lead', 'Actress', 'drama', 'series', 'perpetually', 'old', 'cranky', 'Ellen', 'Corby', 'winning', 'Emmy', 'supporting', 'actress', 'Does', 'anyone', 'recall', 'Ellen', 'Corby', 'playing', 'anything', 'other', 'old', 'lady', 'Grandma', 'can', 'only', 'recall', 'one', 'role', 'pioneering', 'farming', 'homesteader', 'movie', 'Shane', 'Richard', 'Thomas', 'series', 'together', 'being', 'person', 'stories', 'are', 'being', 'told', 'When', 'Richard', 'Thomas', 'show', 'season', 'five', 'series', 'central', 'focus', 'series', 'still', 'entertaining', 'season', 'five', 'loss', 'John-Boy', 'imposible', 'overcome.I', 'heartily', 'recommend', 'Season', 'Four', 'Waltons', 'something', 'family', 'can', 'watch', 'learn', 'important', 'life-lessons', 'far-cry', 'today', 'tv', 'viewing', 'Konedog', 'Koenig']",The Waltons: Season 4

They know how to avoid cliches (where the Bradys cannot) and (sorry, again) know how to be BOTH sincere AND endearing WITHOUT being lame or watering it down (where 7th Heaven always seems to excel at).  Plus, they also know how to show a little more pickup (where Little House can't; it's not at all lame, but does tend to drag on).Sure, they even have their own disputes and squabbles amongst themselves, but also without turning it into something downright nasty, brutal, or patronizing.

The acting and writing during all four years is superb. The setting is sublime. Every storyline shows how people with morals confront the daily issues of life. Every storyline shows how people with strong family ties and strong family values deal with important issues of their daily lives.The characters of season four have remained true to the personalities we began to love in the first season. John-Boy, Olivia, grandpa, grandma, Jason and John were superbly cast and are amazingly talented actors. By season four the viewer knows these characters as if they were friends or neighbors.The writing and dialogue of this show is simply superb. Seldom if ever does the viewer find themselves wondering what's going on in a scene; in fact, its just the opposite.
