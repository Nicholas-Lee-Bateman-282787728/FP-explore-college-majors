And while they may not be on stage, they are still performing!The best scene for me was watching a duet and when the tenor died, he sank to the floor and laid there, playing dead, while the soprano sang and sang.  From below camera range you hear him ask, ""Can I get up now?"" and she quickly hisses ""No!"" and keeps on singing.  And he stays down!It's inspiring to see that, no matter what, these people are still vital and enthusiastic and entertained by the music they worked with all their lives.People are the strangest animals!

It is a visit to la casa Verdi, the house for retired opera singers created by Verdi in Milan. What do you do, how do you live when you are a retired artist, when you have been singing all around the world, and now you are just very old in a retirement home?La casa Verdi lived of the rights of Verdi's compositions, but Verdi is in the public domain now, the house survives on charity.The director of the movie, Daniel Schmid, says the movie was a hard sell: indeed not many people are interested in the opera, and nobody is interested in old people.It is, however, moving to see these very old people, some of them hardly walking, sing and discuss singers (""it is impossible to find a good Othello any more""), and show the costumes of their time of glory. They still have a voice. They still vibrate from that unique love of music. It is a rarefied unique world, yet extraordinary human.If it is who we are and how we die, then we have done good, we humans.Shed a tear, here comes Tosca's kiss and her last bow.",5,A must see for Opera lovers,1314057600,"08 23, 2011",2011,1113,"['Not', 'many', 'documentaries', 'survive', '25', 'years', 'saw', 'when', 'came', 'out', '1984', 'never', 'forgot', 'visit', 'la', 'casa', 'Verdi', 'house', 'retired', 'opera', 'singers', 'created', 'Verdi', 'Milan', 'What', 'do', 'do', 'how', 'do', 'live', 'when', 'are', 'retired', 'artist', 'when', 'have', 'been', 'singing', 'world', 'now', 'are', 'just', 'very', 'old', 'retirement', 'home', 'La', 'Verdi', 'lived', 'rights', 'Verdi', 'compositions', 'Verdi', 'public', 'domain', 'now', 'house', 'charity.The', 'director', 'movie', 'Daniel', 'Schmid', 'movie', 'was', 'hard', 'sell', 'indeed', 'not', 'many', 'people', 'are', 'interested', 'opera', 'nobody', 'interested', 'old', 'people.It', 'however', 'moving', 'see', 'very', 'old', 'people', 'hardly', 'walking', 'sing', 'discuss', 'singers', 'impossible', 'find', 'good', 'Othello', 'more', 'show', 'costumes', 'time', 'glory', 'still', 'have', 'voice', 'still', 'vibrate', 'unique', 'love', 'music', 'rarefied', 'unique', 'world', 'yet', 'extraordinary', 'human.If', 'who', 'are', 'how', 'die', 'then', 'have', 'done', 'good', 'humans.Shed', 'tear', 'here', 'Tosca', 'kiss', 'last', 'bow']",N/A

Davidsen ""Claudia Davidsen""","[2, 2]","Update - 07-2013: Be sure to catch ""Quartet"" with Maggie Smith and a host of others, including Dame Gwyneth Jones (who does her own singing of that most famous aria from Tosca.)  I am guessing that Dustin Hoffman had seen and was wonderfully inspired by Tosca's Kiss.The documentary, Tosca's Kiss, is all the good things mentioned by other reviewers.The rest home for elderly musicians founded by Giuseppe Verdi was still in operation in the mid-1980s.  It is wonderful that director, Daniel Schmid, saw the aging institution and its residents as a fitting subject.  Schmid revealed a microcosm of the universal problems of aging, especially in this rarified population of artists.The camera was as unrelenting as the film-makers were compassionate.  It followed its ""cast"" from the public rooms to their own small bed/sitting rooms.  Once significant artists, such as Sara Scuderi and Giuseppe Manacchini, were filmed alongside other lesser known artists.  The treatment of these people was respectful, but not worshipful.  In the mode of ""less is more"", the documentary left viewers to their own conclusions rather than pushing an agenda.  It truly let the camera do the talking.You may find yourself sympathizing with the plight of people who have only their memories; you may find yourself inspired by their resilience.  I found both.  Ladies were draped in once-lovely furs fighting off the chronic chill of old age, wearing bedroom slippers on ruined feet--another plague of old age.  A small man sporting a sparse comb-over spent a lot of time offering  ""proof"" of the legitimacy of the many diplomas and other documents decking his few walls.  He prefaced all of this by saying it didn't mean a thing to him.  I had to admire them all for getting to the music parlor, joining in the singing, and just keeping on.On the subject of lousy technology:  Be aware that I and others were not able to access the bonus audio of Scuderi in her prime.  Neither was I able to use the DVD Rom to access notes and biographies.  On my computer, which is a Mac, I could select the DVD Rom, get the opening screen announcing the data, but could not go beyond that.  There are no menu options for actually opening the DVD Rom.  Since there is little information on these people on the internet, I was especially interested in the Rom.",4,Great film.

Behrens ""Frank Behrens""","[7, 8]","Who wants to see a film about old people? asks director Daniel Schmid in a special feature to the DVD ""Tosca's Kiss"" on EMI label (7243 5 99785 9). Well, if those old people are retired opera stars living at the Casa Verdi, founded especially for them and those like them, you have a lovely 87-minute film that shows their daily lives, still devoted entirely to opera and sharing their memories. Also sharing their voices, many of which have lasted surprisingly well down through the years.Chief among the old-timers at the foundation is soprano Sara Scuderi, sort of a queen bee as it seems, whose presence ties the film together. Anyone interested in opera MUST see this, anyone who simply likes to watch senior citizens refusing to go gently into that good night should see this.I read on the back that there are three CD tracks and some DVD-ROM features--most annoying to those without personal computers and those with them but without the required programs-but I could not bring up either of them after having some Adobe Acrobat software and some DVD-reading hardware installed at great expense. A bad direction for companies to take just to save some paper.

843908,A3803F3P5DG3YD,B0002S308E,P. Tenaglia,"[1, 1]","Hearing that ""Tosca's Kiss"" was the basis of the new Dustin Hoffman/Maggie Smith movie ""Quartet"" I was curious about it. This is the documentary of the retirement home in Italy for retired opera singers (and musicians who played for the opera) that the composer Verdi bequeathed to them after his death. Watching these elderly people who were the toast of the opera world in their time was quite moving, at times it brought tears to my eyes. Just as in ""Quartet"" they would occasionally burst into song (solo, duet or group) though I suspect some of it was for the benefit of the camera. Still, to watch these old pros (and some still had glorious voices) in action was a lesson for all of us: just because you're elderly doesn't mean you have nothing to offer anymore. Some of the scenes could have been edited down (one conductor rambles at length), but watching these fascinating people who are still viable artists was inspirational.

843909,A3DT7D2KEJLR38,B0002S308E,R. Ramon,"[2, 2]","Schmid has given us a tribute to operatic musicians of yesteryear and to the great composer Verdi himself, who graciously provided the retirement home where they they would be able to live out their final years. Potent and eccentric personalities abound in this film, but you can't help but be touched by their warmth, candor and catty humor as they recall their careers in the operatic world of some 60-70 years ago, and by their frailty as their aging bodies and voices no longer serve them as they once did. Several also express their displeasure with the current state of opera, and we would do well to note and learn from their observations. These singers paid their dues and were artists and stars in their day, and that required dedication, hard work and commitment to their art. Soprano Sara Scuderi is the central singer in this cast, and she possesses an endearing, almost girlish charm when she reminisces about her great career and when she sings, in a voice still beautiful more than forty years after she retired.
