I also read the book later.  It's a funny movie with a socio-political message for women's liberation, back in the 1960s when women's rights often meant the right to go to college to become a nurse, a secretary, or a school teacher.This movie is clean.  Even the ""violence"" has no blood.  We let our baby watch the DVD!  The language is clean.  There's no ""real"" offensive violence, sex in any form, attacks on religion, foul language, or any of the other junk pushed by modern Hollywood.  There's fighting, yes, but think Three Stooges, not Terminator.SPOILER ALERT: Now for what happens.  Stop here if you want it to be a complete surprise.The movie, like the book, starts out in medias res, or at least something very close to that.  Dick van Dyke is writing his fianc&eacute;e from sick bay on a Navy ship.  Going back chronologically, van Dyke, an engaged Navy pilot, finds himself marooned after his jet catches fire, stuck on an uninhabited South Pacific Island.  His companions include an astrochimp named Floyd, who, although quite intelligent, nearly killed the marooned pilot at their first meeting.  They're soon joined by a strong-willed young lady from a different island, sent there by her polygamous match-making throw-them-to-the-sharks chief-father to die for the crime of refusing a marriage he arranged for her.  Survival and trick-them ""weaponry"" are aided by the finding of a grounded Japanese submarine left over from WWII with lots of workable gear--""a Japanese supermarket"", exclaims Crusoe.  A bevy of young island ladies soon joins them, sisters and cousins of the girl sent to die.  Battle plans are drawn to take on the inevitable clash when the chief, the girl's father, comes with his contingent to see if she's still alive.There are enough bloopers to fill a page.  Islanders have to speak English for an audience too young to read subtitles.  And there are blond jokes here as these dark-haired ""native"" girls learn what explosives and the like can do.  The message of the movie is that women have rights, and can choose their mates.  Ironically, the movie makes these young ladies out to be a bunch of, dare we say, dumb girls?  These are real Pacific islanders used in the filming, no doubt, not the dark-haired whites used for Indians in modern westerns,  and these Islanders are clothed well enough for an audience of children in the 1960s.The movie is all comedy.  The ending is a surprise, but before that, we see the inevitable battle scene, a lovers triangle (again, nothing any kid couldn't view) as the young island lady starts falling in love with this engaged man, and enough Dick van Dyke comedy to keep the movie, like Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, from getting boring, even after several viewings.  And of course there's the fact that the Navy is more interested in the chimp than the pilot, a fact brought out at the beginning of the movie and even more clearly at the beginning of the book and at the end of the movie.",5,Funny and Clean,1353283200,"11 19, 2012",2012,3125,"['saw', 'movie', 'currently', 'rated', 'G', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'back', 'days', 'when', 'kids', 'went', 'alone', 'safely', 'movies', '50', 'cent', 'matinees', 'Saturdays', 'also', 'read', 'book', 'later', 'funny', 'movie', 'socio-political', 'message', 'women', 'liberation', 'back', '1960s', 'when', 'women', 'rights', 'often', 'meant', 'right', 'go', 'college', 'become', 'nurse', 'secretary', 'school', 'teacher.This', 'movie', 'clean', 'Even', 'violence', 'blood', 'let', 'baby', 'watch', 'DVD', 'language', 'clean', 'real', 'offensive', 'violence', 'sex', 'form', 'attacks', 'religion', 'foul', 'language', 'other', 'junk', 'pushed', 'modern', 'Hollywood', 'fighting', 'yes', 'think', 'Three', 'Stooges', 'not', 'Terminator.SPOILER', 'ALERT', 'Now', 'what', 'Stop', 'here', 'want', 'be', 'complete', 'surprise.The', 'movie', 'book', 'out', 'medias', 'res', 'least', 'something', 'very', 'close', 'Dick', 'van', 'Dyke', 'writing', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'sick', 'bay', 'Navy', 'ship', 'Going', 'back', 'chronologically', 'van', 'Dyke', 'engaged', 'Navy', 'pilot', 'marooned', 'jet', 'catches', 'fire', 'stuck', 'uninhabited', 'South', 'Pacific', 'Island', 'companions', 'include', 'astrochimp', 'named', 'Floyd', 'who', 'quite', 'intelligent', 'nearly', 'killed', 'marooned', 'pilot', 'first', 'meeting', ""'re"", 'soon', 'joined', 'strong-willed', 'young', 'lady', 'different', 'island', 'sent', 'there', 'polygamous', 'match-making', 'throw-them-to-the-sharks', 'chief-father', 'die', 'crime', 'refusing', 'marriage', 'arranged', 'Survival', 'trick-them', 'weaponry', 'are', 'aided', 'finding', 'grounded', 'Japanese', 'submarine', 'left', 'over', 'WWII', 'lots', 'workable', 'gear', 'Japanese', 'supermarket', 'Crusoe', 'A', 'bevy', 'young', 'island', 'ladies', 'soon', 'sisters', 'cousins', 'girl', 'sent', 'die', 'Battle', 'plans', 'are', 'drawn', 'take', 'inevitable', 'clash', 'when', 'chief', 'girl', 'father', 'contingent', 'see', 'still', 'are', 'enough', 'bloopers', 'fill', 'page', 'Islanders', 'have', 'speak', 'English', 'audience', 'too', 'young', 'read', 'subtitles', 'are', 'blond', 'jokes', 'here', 'dark-haired', 'native', 'girls', 'learn', 'what', 'like', 'can', 'do', 'message', 'movie', 'women', 'have', 'rights', 'can', 'choose', 'mates', 'Ironically', 'movie', 'young', 'ladies', 'out', 'be', 'bunch', 'dare', 'say', 'dumb', 'girls', 'are', 'real', 'Pacific', 'islanders', 'used', 'filming', 'doubt', 'not', 'dark-haired', 'whites', 'used', 'Indians', 'modern', 'westerns', 'Islanders', 'are', 'clothed', 'well', 'enough', 'audience', 'children', '1960s.The', 'movie', 'comedy', 'ending', 'surprise', 'see', 'inevitable', 'battle', 'scene', 'lovers', 'triangle', 'again', 'nothing', 'kid', 'could', ""n't"", 'view', 'young', 'island', 'lady', 'falling', 'love', 'engaged', 'man', 'enough', 'Dick', 'van', 'Dyke', 'comedy', 'keep', 'movie', 'Chitty', 'Chitty', 'Bang', 'Bang', 'getting', 'boring', 'even', 'several', 'viewings', 'course', 'fact', 'Navy', 'more', 'interested', 'chimp', 'pilot', 'fact', 'brought', 'out', 'beginning', 'movie', 'even', 'more', 'clearly', 'beginning', 'book', 'end', 'movie']",N/A
877789,A14JEURPY1CXZB,B00077BPFU,James D. Leverton,"[145, 189]","It's been a long time since I've seen this film, and I remember it to be an engaging slapstick farce with Dick Van Dyke in top form as the title character, a descendant of the original Robinson Crusoe who, while on training mission, crash-lands on a tropical island.  He must fend for himself while awaiting rescue, with only fellow castaway Floyd the astrochimp and a native girl he names Wednesday to keep him company.  It's a funny and fast-paced lark, and very typical of '60's Disney product.Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this version of the film for purchase at this time.  Here are five reasons why:1.  Like ""Million Dollar Duck"" and ""Barefoot Executive"", ""Lt. Robin Crusoe, U.S.N."" is being released to DVD in a lazy, fullscreen version instead of the family-friendly 1:66:1 aspect ratio it was originally filmed in.  As a film purist, I simply refuse to buy anything that isn't presented in the format it was originally filmed in.  That Disney is dumping old films on DVD in the old fullscreen VHS format shows a total lack of respect for the filmmakers and the consumer alike.2.  I see no indication on the packaging that this film has been digitally restored.  Therefore, I must conclude the DVD contains the same tired old print of the film that was originally released on VHS.  Even more galling is the fact that the sound hasn't been upgraded to stereo, but according to the packaging is presented in ""mono.""  I ask consumers everywhere:  why bother replacing old VHS films with DVDs that are of no better quality than what you already have?3.  There are absolutely no extras presented with this film.  No ""making of"" documentary, no commentary with Mr. Van Dyke, no original theatrical trailer, nothing.  That Disney released this film with no extras makes the lack of a widescreen print even more annoying, since there is more than enough room on a DVD to present both fullscreen and widescreen versions of the film.  Other companies, especially MGM/UA, do it all this time.  Why can't Disney?  It's simple:  laziness and lack of respect for the consumer.4.  This DVD is ridiculously expensive, expecially at the original retail price of $19.95, which is a full $10 more than most bare-bones DVDs are priced by other companies.  Disney has always been known for gouging its fans at the cash register, but this is ridiculous.5.  1+2+3+4=ONE BIG RIPOFF.  Once again, Disney rips-off its consumers, and they'll continue to laugh all the way to the bank unless we take a stand.  Therefore, I ask fans everywhere:BOYCOTT ANY DISNEY DVD THAT IS NOT RESTORED AND PRESENTED IN WIDESCREEN FORMAT.

And interestingly, before the DVD and download streaming release became available, was a pricing favorite among video extortionists - with copies selling for ridiculous amounts. I can recall dupes of this film, as little as five years ago, going for as much as $75 on the gray market. Dupes, not even original tapes.If you doubt what I say, try looking up the theatrical version of Disney's 'Dr. Syn Alias The Scarecrow' with Patrick McGoohan and see what you find.In this production, the always enjoyable and elastic Dick Van Dyke plays Lt. Robinson Crusoe, naval aviator. Amusingly, he mentions his own discouragement with his dad, a city bus driver in Cleveland, having named him after so infamous a character of fiction.And sure enough, having tempted fate, Lt. Crusoe suffers a massive engine failure during a patrol flight in the far western Pacific. He's going down hundreds of miles away from his home carrier. Mind you, this was the 1960s - there was no such thing as GPS or a satellite that would be capable of searching the open seas. Pilots overflying open water had to best guess their positions, if they even had a chance to do so, before bailing out. Open water recovery was a crapshoot at best and the Navy lost many aviators who went down that way in real life.But this is Disney. And Lt. Crusoe is headed for a year-long adventure that includes a derelict Japanese submarine, a lost space chimp, wisecracking myna bird, a tribe of wacky headhunters, and a bevy of beautiful women who have just discovered female independence.And speaking of women. I can't imagine a sexier 'Friday' than played by Nancy Kwan as Wednesday. Wow, she was quite something back then.The usual Disney hijinks (gotta love that ridiculous bamboo sextant) and typical fun-house plot interweaving with Van Dyke's amazing timing and self-deprecating humor produced an incredibly funny and infinitely enjoyable film.Remember Jane. :-D",5,"""Remember Jane""",1335052800,"04 22, 2012",2012,1957,"['Disney', 'all-time', 'favorite', 'interestingly', 'DVD', 'download', 'streaming', 'release', 'became', 'available', 'was', 'pricing', 'favorite', 'video', 'extortionists', 'copies', 'selling', 'ridiculous', 'amounts', 'can', 'recall', 'dupes', 'film', 'as', 'little', 'five', 'years', 'ago', 'going', 'as', 'much', '75', 'gray', 'market', 'Dupes', 'not', 'even', 'original', 'tapes.If', 'doubt', 'what', 'say', 'try', 'looking', 'up', 'theatrical', 'version', 'Disney', ""'Dr"", 'Syn', 'Alias', 'Scarecrow', 'Patrick', 'McGoohan', 'see', 'what', 'find.In', 'production', 'always', 'enjoyable', 'elastic', 'Dick', 'Van', 'Dyke', 'Lt.', 'Robinson', 'Crusoe', 'naval', 'aviator', 'Amusingly', 'own', 'discouragement', 'dad', 'city', 'bus', 'driver', 'Cleveland', 'having', 'named', 'so', 'infamous', 'character', 'fiction.And', 'sure', 'enough', 'having', 'tempted', 'fate', 'Lt.', 'Crusoe', 'massive', 'engine', 'failure', 'patrol', 'flight', 'far', 'western', 'Pacific', 'going', 'down', 'hundreds', 'miles', 'away', 'home', 'carrier', 'Mind', 'was', '1960s', 'was', 'such', 'thing', 'GPS', 'satellite', 'would', 'be', 'capable', 'searching', 'open', 'seas', 'Pilots', 'overflying', 'open', 'water', 'had', 'best', 'positions', 'even', 'had', 'chance', 'do', 'so', 'bailing', 'out', 'Open', 'water', 'recovery', 'was', 'crapshoot', 'best', 'Navy', 'lost', 'many', 'aviators', 'who', 'went', 'way', 'real', 'life.But', 'Disney', 'Lt.', 'Crusoe', 'headed', 'year-long', 'adventure', 'derelict', 'Japanese', 'submarine', 'lost', 'space', 'chimp', 'wisecracking', 'myna', 'bird', 'tribe', 'wacky', 'headhunters', 'bevy', 'beautiful', 'women', 'who', 'have', 'just', 'discovered', 'female', 'independence.And', 'speaking', 'women', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'sexier', ""'Friday"", 'played', 'Nancy', 'Kwan', 'Wednesday', 'Wow', 'was', 'quite', 'something', 'back', 'then.The', 'usual', 'Disney', 'hijinks', 'got', 'ta', 'love', 'ridiculous', 'bamboo', 'sextant', 'typical', 'fun-house', 'plot', 'interweaving', 'Van', 'Dyke', 'amazing', 'timing', 'self-deprecating', 'humor', 'produced', 'incredibly', 'funny', 'infinitely', 'enjoyable', 'film.Remember', 'Jane', '-D']",N/A

I used to watch this film a lot as a teenager because I've always had an interest in ""deserted south pacific islands"" (""Gilligan's Island"" was one of my favourite childhood shows, I loved ""Swiss Family Robinson"", I dreamed of visiting Tahiti and Fiji when a 4th grade teacher spoke about such islands existing, and a part of me still fantasizes about the Peace Corps).This film is a Disney classic which still holds up well today.  I'm not sure if savvy modern-day children will like this kind of film, but I imagine they will.  The humor is timeless and Dick Van Dyke is the sort of actor that children gravitate to (perhaps ""the Mary Poppins effect"").  I like this retelling of the ""Robinson Crusoe"" story, modernizing it and adding much humor as well.  The chimp as sidekick is great.My favorite part of the movie is when Lt Crusoe meets the island ladies and they speak pidgin to comedic effect (like using ""cow-cow"").  There were so many lines in this film that my sister and I loved to quote to one another, such as ""Kabuna say 'women got rights!'""  Just the word ""Kabuna"" sounds funny when you say it.  I love how Lt Crusoe plays with the natives' superstitious belief in idols, by making Kabuna (an Easter Island looking tiki rock carving that the island natives worship) speak with a booming voice.  Ah, to be stranded on an island full of beautiful native women!  This film is kind of a parody about the women's liberation movement, as Lt Crusoe changes the women to be less submissive and more independent, which has an unintended consequence for him...as they chase after him and he's still dreaming about his girl in the U.S.This one is a classic and will definitely be a part of my collection.  I could watch it over and over and still laugh myself silly.  Unfortunately, Disney doesn't make movies like this anymore, but I hope they won't even attempt to remake it (as they did with other classics like ""The Parent Trap"" and ""Freaky Friday"").
