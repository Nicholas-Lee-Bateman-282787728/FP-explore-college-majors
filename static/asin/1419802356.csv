174009,A2EEUQ81DTY7G3,1419802356,A Customer,"[7, 13]","Everything is Illuminated is a bit of a mixed bag. It's a wildly uneven movie that starts off well, and is strafed with a sort of darkly comic irony, but soon descends into an under whelming and rather anemic road movie, where the resolution doesn't nearly pack as much of an emotional punch as it should. Consequently, the film doesn't really satisfy or illuminate. Maybe it has something to so with Live Schreiber's earnest and overly languid direction; there's a lot of warm eccentricity here, but not that much dramatic heft.Based on Jonathan Safran Foer's novel Everything is Illuminated, the film tells of New York writer Jonathan Foer (Elijah Wood), who arrives in Odessa looking for the village of Trachimbrod, and a woman he thinks saved his late grandfather from the Nazis; he is helped by a hip-hop-obsessed young stud named Alex (Eugene Hutz). Alex lives in Odessa and helps to run a family company that drives rich Jews around Ukraine in search of their lost heritage. The car's driver is Alex's dyspeptic grandfather, also named Alex (Boris Leskin) an anti-Semite with a transparently guilty conscience.There's also the grandfather's dog Sammy Davis Jr. Jr. whom he claims to need as a seeing-eye dog, even though he's not blind, being the driver, whom Alex cheerfully calls ""deranged,"" and is actually the cutest thing about the movie. Schreiber wisely gives us lots of Alex and Sammy David Jr. because without their comic relief the film would probably be deadly dull.The charismatic Hutz - in his acting debut here - is about the best thing the film has going for it, especially when one considers the character of Foer. Sticking Wood in a black suit and nerd glasses to accentuate his big blue eyes, and have him walk around like a faulty android comes across as just too weird, This all may be meant to parody the stiffness of Foer, a quietly obsessive collector of family artifacts, but the character seems forced and doesn't sit well, but next to the film's other, wonderfully three-dimensional and realistic characters.The film is lovingly photographed; particularly the lush countryside, and the moments of dreamlike surreal images - a cabin surrounded by an improbably perfect field of giant sunflowers - are handled well. But there isn't enough drama here to sustain an entire film, and Schreiber's direction is just so relentlessly timid and overly cute. That lush soundtrack of traditional music is all right for about half an hour, but rapidly becomes irritating and swells up in all the wrong places.The ideas behind the movie are good - the importance of memory, history and heritage, holding onto the detritus of the past, the necessity of storytelling, and of sifting through and distilling and bringing the imagination to bear on one's past. But Schreiber isn't able to incorporate these ideas into a completely dramatic scenario that resonates with the viewer; consequently the movie remains abstract, rather closed, and almost wimpy. When the eponymous illumination comes and a secret is revealed, it's horrific, but also quite confusing, and even unexpectedly hackneyed.

I didn't, and I still got Jonathan Safran Foer's point. Here he's played by Elijah Wood, and frankly I liked Wood better as Frodo. He had more character, more spunk and more depth.But the film is good nevertheless, thanks to Alex (Eugene Hutz)""Jonfan's"" tour guide, whose malapropisms, in charming Russian-accented English, make the movie. This is a funny and poignant movie, at once.It's very easy, from the get-go to determine what's likely to happen, as Jonathan bags up bits and pieces of the past in Glad-Bag zip top sandwich bags, including the dirt from under his shoes, an occasional leaf, and just about everything else imaginable. As his grandmother lays dying, and hands him a yellowed photograph of his grandfather Safron with a woman named Augustina, who rescued his beloved grandfather before the Nazis invaded Ukraine, it's a sure bet he'll be off to find out more as soon as possible.Initially, it seems that Alex's family, particularly his strange, foul-mouthed grandfather (Stephen Samudovsky), accompanied by a female stray he named Sammy Davis Jr. Jr., that Jonfan is about to disappear into the depths of antisemitic Ukraine. But what transpires is inspiring, even if predictable, and the scenery and Ukrainian music are awesome.This may be a first film, but Liev Schreiber directed a nice one here.

174013,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,1419802356,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 2]","I really wanted to love this movie.  Having read and adored `Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close', I have since been living on this cloud where everything written by or inspired of Jonathan Safran Foer must be luminous; even though I have yet to broach any of his other work (I have them all sitting on my shelf, but there are so many books that need to be read that prioritizing is very difficult for me).  So, with that in mind, I embarked on soaking in the film adaptation for `Everything is Illuminated', Foer's first shot at fame and one that he is often remembered for.  The novel received considerably good reviews, and while I remember the film receiving less than stellar remarks I was still interested in seeing this for myself.I'm scared.The reason I say `I'm scared' is that I am highly anticipating the film adaptation of `Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close' and after watching Foer's lyrical style misrepresented on film here I'm nervous that it just isn't an easy translation.  Foer writes with such ferocity, such unique and obscure energy.  He hints at humor with embellished gimmicks that feel rooted in something real; human.  That feeling is betrayed in the uneven way in which `Everything is Illuminated' is filmed.  I remember having a similar feeling when watching `American Psycho' (two drastically different films, but my point is the same).  Bret Easton Ellis's novel was so rich with subtle subtext that rode the line of hilarious yet never crossed that line, always inhabiting itself with something completely serious in tone.  The film held that for the first half and then let go into complete chaos and lunacy to the point where Ellis's entire `message' was lost.  While I have not read the novel, I feel that I understand Foer's stylistic approach and so I feel that this film doesn't really do that approach any justice.  The first half is basically a comedy that isn't very funny, that tries to translate Foer's style to the screen verbatim (which is never a good thing) and so it becomes awkward.  Then, when things become `illuminated', the film takes a strangely serious tone that undermines the entire tone of the first three quarters.  Doing this takes the guts of the story and makes them feel unnatural.  They don't fit and so they feel `off'.  This is a shame because it is in those moments that the heart of the story is exposed, and that heart isn't given the tender affection it deserved because the audience is left bewildered at the first half of the film.I digress.There are some very strong facets of this film though.  The score is delightful.  It is flirtatious and whimsical and yet poignant and, when necessary, it is heartfelt.  The cinematography has moments of blissful wonderment, and Lista's home alone is a brilliant showcase in art direction.  Of the performances, one truly shines.  Boris Leskin is sensational as the crazy `thinks he's blind' grandfather harboring a dark secret behind his stereotypical demeanor.  He layers his `crankiness' with a soulfulness that is brought to full fruition as the film draws to a close.Wood is semi-effective, but the role is rather one-note and more observational than anything else; and Hutz is awful (but apparently that is my opinion and my opinion only).In the end, `Everything is Illuminated' has its moments, and the second half is far better than the first, but where style is often used effectively on the written page, it runs the risk of appearing gimmicky and forced on the big screen and sadly, that is what has happened here.",3,Everything is not what it could have been...,1318464000,"10 13, 2011",2011,3535,"['really', 'wanted', 'love', 'movie', 'Having', 'read', 'adored', 'Extremely', 'Loud', 'Incredibly', 'Close', 'have', 'been', 'living', 'cloud', 'where', 'everything', 'written', 'inspired', 'Jonathan', 'Safran', 'Foer', 'must', 'be', 'luminous', 'even', 'have', 'yet', 'broach', 'other', 'work', 'have', 'sitting', 'shelf', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'books', 'need', 'be', 'read', 'prioritizing', 'very', 'difficult', 'So', 'mind', 'embarked', 'soaking', 'film', 'adaptation', 'Everything', 'Illuminated', 'Foer', 'first', 'shot', 'fame', 'one', 'often', 'remembered', 'novel', 'received', 'considerably', 'good', 'reviews', 'remember', 'film', 'receiving', 'less', 'stellar', 'remarks', 'was', 'still', 'interested', 'seeing', 'myself.I', ""'m"", 'scared.The', 'reason', 'say', ""'m"", 'scared', 'am', 'highly', 'anticipating', 'film', 'adaptation', 'Extremely', 'Loud', 'Incredibly', 'Close', 'watching', 'Foer', 'lyrical', 'style', 'misrepresented', 'film', 'here', ""'m"", 'nervous', 'just', ""n't"", 'easy', 'translation', 'Foer', 'such', 'ferocity', 'such', 'unique', 'obscure', 'energy', 'humor', 'embellished', 'gimmicks', 'feel', 'rooted', 'something', 'real', 'human', 'feeling', 'betrayed', 'uneven', 'way', 'Everything', 'Illuminated', 'filmed', 'remember', 'having', 'similar', 'feeling', 'when', 'watching', 'American', 'Psycho', 'two', 'drastically', 'different', 'films', 'point', 'same', 'Bret', 'Easton', 'Ellis', 'novel', 'was', 'so', 'rich', 'subtle', 'subtext', 'rode', 'line', 'hilarious', 'yet', 'never', 'crossed', 'line', 'always', 'inhabiting', 'something', 'completely', 'serious', 'tone', 'film', 'held', 'first', 'half', 'then', 'let', 'go', 'complete', 'chaos', 'lunacy', 'point', 'where', 'Ellis', 'entire', 'message', 'was', 'lost', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'novel', 'feel', 'understand', 'Foer', 'stylistic', 'approach', 'so', 'feel', 'film', ""n't"", 'really', 'do', 'approach', 'justice', 'first', 'half', 'basically', 'comedy', ""n't"", 'very', 'funny', 'translate', 'Foer', 'style', 'screen', 'verbatim', 'never', 'good', 'thing', 'awkward', 'Then', 'when', 'things', 'become', 'illuminated', 'film', 'strangely', 'serious', 'tone', 'entire', 'tone', 'first', 'three', 'quarters', 'Doing', 'guts', 'story', 'feel', 'unnatural', 'do', ""n't"", 'fit', 'so', 'feel', 'shame', 'moments', 'heart', 'story', 'exposed', 'heart', ""n't"", 'given', 'tender', 'affection', 'deserved', 'audience', 'left', 'bewildered', 'first', 'half', 'film.I', 'are', 'very', 'strong', 'facets', 'film', 'score', 'delightful', 'flirtatious', 'whimsical', 'yet', 'poignant', 'when', 'necessary', 'heartfelt', 'cinematography', 'moments', 'blissful', 'wonderment', 'Lista', 'home', 'alone', 'brilliant', 'showcase', 'art', 'direction', 'performances', 'one', 'truly', 'shines', 'Boris', 'Leskin', 'sensational', 'crazy', 'thinks', 'blind', 'grandfather', 'harboring', 'dark', 'secret', 'stereotypical', 'demeanor', 'crankiness', 'soulfulness', 'brought', 'full', 'fruition', 'film', 'close.Wood', 'semi-effective', 'role', 'rather', 'one-note', 'more', 'observational', 'anything', 'else', 'Hutz', 'awful', 'apparently', 'opinion', 'opinion', 'only', '.In', 'end', 'Everything', 'Illuminated', 'moments', 'second', 'half', 'far', 'better', 'first', 'where', 'style', 'often', 'used', 'effectively', 'written', 'page', 'risk', 'appearing', 'gimmicky', 'forced', 'big', 'screen', 'sadly', 'happened', 'here']",N/A

174015,A40ZMW3GWOB2O,1419802356,Away2BlueRidge,"[0, 0]","This movie is a well-kept secret and quirky treasure.  &#8220;Everything is Illuminated&#8221; came out of nowhere and stole my heart.  I liked it so much that I watched it all the way through a second time, less than a week after my first viewing &#8211; something I only do for exceptional movies, when there are so many other things to watch.  Directed by Liev Schreiber, the movie came out in 2005, and is based on a book of the same name by Brooklyn-based author Jonathan Safran Foer. I found the movie after reading a non-fiction book on a totally different subject by Safran that knocked my socks off.  I searched Amazon to see what else this creative genius had done, since his writing and his mind are exceptional. What struck me so much about Safran&#8217;s work was that he has a rare talent for luring us into very &#8220;difficult&#8221; subjects by disarming us with humor.  I feel I needed to say that first, because otherwise, it would be almost impossible to explain that this is a Holocaust-related film that is both poignant and laugh-out-loud funny.I cannot comment on differences between the novel and movie, as other reviewers have, because I stumbled across the movie without having read the book.  But what Liev Schreiber has done with this story is so remarkable that any handwringing about its faithfulness to the novel might be irrelevant.  Sometimes two minds are better than one, and this movie truly works.  Let&#8217;s make that &#8220;soars&#8221; &#8211; this is not a workhorse translation of book to movie &#8211; it&#8217;s more of a collaborative metamorphosis. Indeed, the mind-meld between Safran and Schreiber to make this movie cannot have been less awkward than the movie-story&#8217;s collaboration between the two oddball main characters.  (They share the stage so completely, that it&#8217;s not possible to say which is the real protagonist.) The story follows the &#8220;odd couple&#8221; of Elijah Wood as seriously near-sighted, urban Jewish vegetarian Jonathan&#8212;on a &#8220;heritage&#8221; tour to find evidence of the woman who saved his grandfather, and Eugene Hutz as &#8220;Alex,&#8221; the Ukrainian &#8220;premium dancer&#8221; who has to make ends meet by conducting tours for &#8220;rich Jews&#8221; who want to find their dead ancestors.Much of the allure of this movie stems from the playful way it uses &#8220;translation&#8221; to make us crack up laughing while pondering the reasons why different cultures use language so differently.  Since the narrator is the Ukrainian Alex, you hear that they are on a &#8220;seriously rigid search&#8221; for Jonathan&#8217;s family&#8217;s past.  As you get into the swing of Alex&#8217;s translation, you will find yourself captivated by the ways that translation affects thought.The dog in the movie is also a scene-stealer, and the dog&#8217;s namesake and personality are interesting highlights of the story.I cannot end this review without also addressing the serious and tragic underpinnings for the story.  As we watched the movie, my husband and I realized that the germ of the story may have come from the sad World War II events in the beleaguered Ukrainian town of Lviv.  I did not hear the town&#8217;s name mentioned in the movie, but my husband spotted one train-station-related clue in the film scenery, suggesting that Lviv was an inspiration.  (I won&#8217;t spoil it &#8211; see if you can find it.)Approach this movie with an open mind &#8211; it does not fit in any typical film genre, and kudos to its makers for that.  It has elements of such disparate genres that it would seem almost schizophrenic to use these &#8220;bins&#8221; to tag or categorize the movie.

Then discovering Eugene Hutz, lead singer of Gogol Bordello (a group which I am totally obsessed with), was in the movie, helped get me to the video store to finally check it out. And I'm glad I did, because I fell in love with this wonderful, quirky, thoughtful, hilarious, melancholy film.Wood plays Jonathan Safran Foer, who goes to Ukraine in search of his roots after his grandmother dies, and he is given a photo of his grandfather with a woman in a field taken during World War II (his family is Jewish). Jonathan has a curious collector's habit of stashing souvenirs (retainers, used condoms, false teeth, jewelry, etc.) in plastic baggies and displaying the collection on the walls of his home. So he heads to Ukraine, and there meets up with his tour guide and translator, played by Stephen Samudovsky and Hutz.Their road trip begins, and the first part is hilarious with the cultural differences emerging (the Ukrainian grandfather and grandson can't figure out why Jonathan would be a vegetarian and figure he must be crazy), and Hutz's Alex is a scene-stealer with his thesaurus-gleaned English (""I am a premisum dancer!"" ""Women want to be carnal with me because I am such a premium dancer!"")It's very funny and amusing and then things grow more dark and  serious as the truth comes out Jonathan's family's past, and Alex finds out some surprising truths about his country's history as well as his family's.On top of that, the scenery is beautiful (that field of sunflowers!) and the music is wonderful, Eastern European music.Samudovsky is fanatastic as the cranky, cantankerous and haunted grandfather.Liev Schrieber put together a wonderful road trip film, now a part of my DVD collection so I can watch any time I wish.

174018,A2582KMXLK2P06,1419802356,B. E Jackson,"[1, 1]","Everything Is Illuminated really is an awesome movie.  It's about a teenage Jewish boy played by Elijah Wood (who actually looks much younger than he really was when he made this movie- he looks 16 but he was probably more around 25) who visits Russia in an attempt to find the woman that freed his grandfather from the Nazi's back in World War II.  However as the story moves along (and especially near the end) what we actually see is a relationship develop between Elijah's English-speaking interpreter and his grandfather, whom Elijah Wood lives with during his visit (and eventually explores together).I must say, the storyline is pretty impressive and moves at exactly the appropriate pace so we don't miss any details.  You'll be reading a fair amount of subtitles on the bottom of the screen, but there's plenty of English speaking too.  It's a combination of both the entire way through.The hilarious moments are usually subtle and come when, to name one segment, Elijah expresses he doesn't eat meat in front of a Russian family who responds by saying ""What kind of person doesn't eat meat?"" and when Elijah asks for a potato instead, the cook brings in a freshly cut raw potato on a plate.  Hilarious!  Also the deranged dog with a sensitive attitude- Elijah Wood and this dog share a few funny scenes.  Actually later on when the woman Elijah is looking for is finally found, we see the dog riding on the hood of a slow-moving vehicle because the older lady refuses to get into the car believing they're too dangerous.  This is another funny moment for a couple reasons.  Basically the movie provides plenty of funny moments to take away from the tragic and serious circumstances that are revealed concerning a horrible World War II story later on.Basically, Elijah Wood, his English-speaking interpreter and the grandfather (of the interpreter) all head out into the middle of Russia's beautiful country outdoors (and I'm hoping this movie really was filmed in Russia because the scenery is absolutely beautiful- especially the river scene showing the fish swimming together in succession).  I don't want to give too much away here, though for me the movie's interesting because it provides a colorful and different aspect of the Russian/American/Jewish relationship currently and how it was back in the WWII days.The ending though... let's just say, we see a certain death in a bathtub and much to my surprise, the reason for this goes MUCH deeper than I ever could have guessed.  In fact, I completely overlooked the reason.  This segment was going for a much deeper meaning here than I was able to grasp.  I had to read other online reviews to find the answer to this particular scene.The soundtrack is beautiful.  Mandolins, violins, accordions and melodic orchestration that feels distinctly Russian.  Then again I'm not really sure if all Russian music resembles this- perhaps it's more diverse, but the soundtrack is lovely all the same.  I'm looking at the soundtrack right now but I don't see a mandolin on the credits of any of the tracks.  Hmmm...  Anyway, one orchestrated piece near the end is really sweeping and joyful- a personal favorite of mine.  This occurs during Elijah's return home after an airplane ride.  This same airport scene contains a moment that's pretty unique- you'll see what I mean when you watch it.  Let's just say, much to Elijah Woods surprise, he sees familiar faces!Overall, great writing and acting, exciting, adventurous, unpredictable writing (certainly unpredictable in many ways), a fresh perspective on the WWII days, unique...

174020,A2ATWKOFJXRRR1,1419802356,"B. Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[27, 30]","Turning a book into film is a sketchy proposition. You never know what the directors, screenwriters, and everyone else involved in the pre, intra, and post-production processes will do with it. Never having read the book (""Everything is Illuminated"" by Jonathan Foer), I can't draw any comparisons ...but this movie definitely made me want to read it. However, I can tell you what an independent gem this film is, and why most of you will enjoy it.The films innate quirkiness will draw many viewers in and hold them to the very end. This was undoubtedly the picture's strongest aspect. Elijah Woods plays Jonathan Foer, an American born Jew who's obsessive/compulsive disorder makes him ""collect"" things. He claims he does it so he'll remember everything but as the film rolls on we see that he's gathered such artifacts as false teeth, insects, and other oddball items. And added to his strange collection one day is a photograph given to him by his ailing grandmother, a photo of his dead grandfather standing next to a pretty woman. The image was taken in the Ukraine, just before the Nazis attacked Russia, and Jonathan doesn't recognize the woman. His grandmother refuses to speak to him about who she is. Jonathan's obsessive/compulsive behavior then takes him to the Ukraine to find out who she was and how she'd affected his grandfather's life ...and ultimately his own.Once inside the former Soviet Union, we get to see Jonathan through the eyes of another quirky duo, a grandfather and grandson, who are ""experts"" in helping American Jews find their heritage in the Ukraine. Ukrainian punk-band leader Eugene Hutz stars as Alex (one of three Alex's actually, a name passed from grandfather, father, to son), one of Jonathan's roughshod drivers and his only translator. Young Alex's English is questionable and he initially views Jonathan as a kind of freak - of course the big glasses and undertaker-style clothes Jonathan wears don't help his perceptions. But Alex is also trying to discover who his own grandfather is (another ""Alex"" played by Boris Leskin, MEN IN BLACK), and why he pretends to be blind (Grandpa Alex is also the main driver of their beat-up European car, which adds some initial comic relief but later becomes extremely important and poignant).Then, of course, there's the ""deranged"" dog, Sammy Davis Jr. Jr. (Yes, that's two Jr.s), Grandpa Alex's ""seeing eye b!tch."" Jonathan has a fear of dogs that seems extreme but later we find that both Sammy Davis Jr. Jr. and Jonathan are bizarre kindred souls - neither of them will eat something that's been on the floor, for example. But they both have surprising abilities even though we see them initially as just messed-up (I'll stop there for fear of giving away too much).The other strong point I liked about this little film was that it was loaded (perhaps overflowing, some might say) with symbolism. In a Hollywood world where we're spoonfed every detail, it was nice to see a movie keep it ""real"". It doesn't drop to the lowest common denominator. If you don't understand something, oh well. And there's lots to think about once the film is over, too. There's a reason Grandpa Alex claims to be blind but isn't, and it's a powerful message. There's a reason Jonathan ""sees"" all his Ukrainian acquaintances once he returns to the States. There's a reason the house where Jonathan finally finds some answers to his many questions is surrounded by sunflowers. Keep your eyes and mind open while watching and you'll be greatly rewarded.I'm going to end this review by commenting on the heavy-handed Holocaust films that've infused Hollyweird over the past several years. Although the Holocaust was a horrible event, and it's something we need to make sure never happens again, beating us over the head with it isn't always the best method to achieve sledgehammer recognition.

I think the core problem is traceable to the book:  the author wasn't sure what he wanted to say, and that indecision makes it into the film.They had all the ingredients of a masterpiece here:  an offbeat film that starts off as a zany road trip but ends up as a poignant statement about a massacre.  But what statement?  The filmmakers didn't seem to know, and in the vacuum of that indecision the writer's inability to draw characters or answer questions meaningfully is thrown into bas relief.I'm sure those hipster filmmakers would be quick to retort that, hey man, this is deep art!  It reflects life in that life doesn't provide easy answers!  It leaves many questions unanswered, in the way life does.  Get it?  Get it?Sorry, but that's a cop-out.  Life is allowed to leave questions unanswered.  Art is not.Otherwise a writer could just fill his novel with a whole bunch of inexplicable mysteries, and whenever a reader objects that he never really arrives at satisfactory knowledge of the book's mysteries, merely reply, ""that's because I'm echoing life, baby!""And maybe you are!

174026,A3SFO2GSP5CVSM,1419802356,"Cosmoetica ""cosmoeticadotcom""","[1, 2]","Everything Is Illuminated was a surprise 2002 hit novel by Jonathan Safran Foer, which was a thinly veiled fictional account of his 1999 trip to Ukraine to research his Jewish roots during World War Two. The young author, only twenty-five at the book's release, elicits a widely divergent critical range of opinion- from hyperbolic praise by established hack writers like Joyce Carol Oates, to outright condemnation by young, unpublished hacks who resent his two book, half a million dollar publishing deal.Never having heard of the writer before, and never having read his work, I had no idea of all this when I picked up the 2005 film version of his book, starring ex-Hobbit Elijah Woof as Foer, and directed by actor Liev Schreiber, his first time behind the camera. What I saw was a truly great, but little, film. More than being simply great, though, the film is, by far, the best fictional film ever made about Jewish suffering during the Final Solution of the Nazi reign of terror in Europe, during World War Two. It achieves this apogee with a deft mix of comedy and drama that is reminiscent of the best of Charlie Chaplin, yet shorn of the worst elements of that Master's sentimentality.How much of this is due to Foer's book, and how much due to the sterling script, penned by Schreiber, I do not know, but the acting is nothing short of spectacular, all around, starting with Wood as Jonathan. He is an obsessive collector, because he fears forgetting his past, and puts all sorts of things in plastic bags. Yet the space for his recently deceased grandfather is bare. All he has of him is a piece of jewelry and an old photo with a woman who hid his grandfather from the Nazis that his grandmother gives him. Jonathan decides to travel to Odessa, Ukraine to find the woman, thank her for saving his ancestor, and learn more about his grandfather's former life....Others have detailed the rest of the plot.... This film succeeds where god-awful pseudo-epics like Schindler's List fail precisely because it mixes in the funny with the horrid, and does not dwell on the pornography of death that many in the business of prostituting the Holocaust and its dead millions rely on. The death of an individual, in this film, is far more affecting than Spielberg's anonymous bodycount. The viewer, who is smart enough, can multiply that by the millions to himself. Seeing the old lady is a collector of the things of the dead, too, is a powerful way to evoke not just the dead's bodies, but their lives and desires, the essence of the human far truer than flesh and blood. Another positive of the film is that it does not tie all things up in a neat bow, and is thus more real than many such films that have to spoonfeed their audiences. Save for Alex's end conversion to Judaism, all these loose ends emotionally fit, so to speak.Fans of the book complain that the illumination at the novel's end is that Alex's grandfather was a Gentile who finked out his Jewish friend to the Nazis to save his own family. This would explain Grandpa's suicide a bit better than believing that he felt some survivor's guilt, when the film makes him a Jew. Yet, since the film ends realistically, without answering all questions, the suicide fits neatly into that spectrum, thus leavening the discrepancy. And, be that as it may, films always have to change things in books, and the film's revelations are no less devastating, and more realistic, especially if you've never read the book, so the argument fails. The film does not. It entertains, enlightens, and leaves a viewer wanting more.

174027,A2RLK9KKVGEETZ,1419802356,"C. Tsao ""Seaview1""","[10, 12]","Actor turned director Liev Schreiber (The Sum of All Fears) does an above average screen version of the novel, Everything Is Illuminated, by author Jonathan Safran Foer.  This tale of journey and self discovery is highlighted by strong ensemble performances and sharp direction with a storyline that enriches and enlightens the soul.Jonathan Foer (Elijah Wood) is a young man who has seen his grandfather, Safran, pass away.  Jonathan has a peculiar habit of taking small objects and life's little memorabilia and sealing them in plastic ziplock bags to display them on his wall.  Safran gives Jonathan an old picture showing a young Safran standing next to a beautiful girl who saved his life many years ago.  Thus Jonathan commences on a long journey to locate this mystery woman in the Ukraine not knowing if she is still alive.  He enlists the help of a brash, young tour guide named Alex (Eugene Hutz) and his grandfather (Boris Leskin) to drive him to his goal.  At first the trip hits dead ends and false leads, but as the group nears its target, the men find themselves amid the ruins of a dark chapter in history with the memories of war and the past ghosts of a nonexistent town.  There, they find their own respective destinies and will be forever changed by what they learn.This film feels like it was directed by someone who knew how to get the most from his actors.  At times, the film is spoken in Russian and seems like a foreign film.  The title itself is a play on self discovery.  This is a thoughtful trek of one man into his past, and his past ironically involves his companions; Jonathan's obsessive journey becomes an emotional journey for Alex and his grandfather as well. It's a tale of bonding over the long haul and the guilt one must carry for a lifetime.  By the end of the film, these characters have all experienced life altering events that will permanently intertwine their lives. It proves that memories can be powerful in traumatizing and also cleansing the soul.  It's also about one's legacy and how others view an event or a person in the past.  Alex eventually sees his grandfather in a completely different light.  Even our perception of these individuals will have changed by film's end which is a tribute to a story that is well told.The story is deceptively simple.  It functions as a road trip movie (like The Straight Story) combined with an interesting mystery story.  It really involves a great many layers of emotions and subplots that range from the past to the present.  The ending is a bit surreal with its d&eacute;j&agrave; vu feeling.Elijah Wood (Sin City, The Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind)) has chosen a wide range of roles ever since his splash in The Lord of the Rings trilogy.  Here, he does a fine job with what is essentially a minimalist role with not much to show.  Eugene Hutz and Boris Leskin fare better as Alex and his grandfather respectively.  Even the grandfather's dog named Sammy Davis Jr. Jr. (that's right) is funny as a fiercely loyal companion.The spare music score by Paul Cantelon is a moody compliment to the thoughtful nature of the film.  The editing is effective as imagery from past and present are linked and transitioned effortlessly.  The cinematography by Matthew Libatique (Gothika, Requiem for a Dream) is appropriately stark and lifeless with some impressive images of war and its aftermath.The coincidences that emerge during the last half of the film make for good drama but are a little too coincidental.  We never fully understand the whole background story of Alex's grandfather and what his motivations are.  Likewise, Jonathan's blank stares and lack of apparent substance and depth do not give us much more than a sketch of a quirky man.  At times, the film feels a little downbeat and depressing as more horrific revelations are exposed.  But these are minor criticisms of what is a good, introspective story with good performances and interesting themes of remembrance and closure.

174028,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,1419802356,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[4, 4]","On the rarest of occasions, a movie comes along that reminds us all that cinema, in its purest form, is an art form, a means to express truth and beauty in the most affecting of ways.  Everything is Illuminated is one of these rare films.  It truly is, as has already been said, a metaphysical journey, one that takes the viewer all the way to the very heart of humanity, evoking both its darkest and lightest aspects along the way.As much as I loved this film, I have no doubts whatsoever that some viewers will find it exceedingly boring.  This is a slow, introspective film that unwinds itself slowly onto the viewer's psyche, replete with long dramatic pauses and what I would call deep internal acting.  In other words, a close-up on a character's face can sometimes be more revealing than an extended piece of dialogue.  I imagine that some will also leave the film feeling as if everything wasn't quite illuminated for them.  It would have been a mistake for the scriptwriter to come right out and explain the meaning of everything, though.  True illumination can only come from within.  In addition to that, the emotional reverberations set off by this story would have been stilled by a direct disclosure of its secrets, thereby robbing the film of its greatest strength.Everything is Illuminated could have been less quirky, though - I'll give you that one.  In a way, though, the quirkiness only makes the film more memorable and endearing.  Early on, in particular, it's hard to tell if Elijah Wood's acting is brilliant or awful, as his character is essentially a human automaton with an immovably emotionless face.  Attired in his somber suit of black, he doesn't exactly fit in with the rural Ukrainian population.  His character, Jonathan, has come to the Ukraine in order to learn more about his grandfather and the woman who helped him escape to the West during World War II.  Jonathan is a collector, an anal-retentive packrat who collects all manner of things about people and places - but he has only two items connected to his grandfather.Strangely enough, the film gradually becomes less about Jonathan and more about his tour guides, Alex (Eugene Hutz) and Alex's grumpy grandfather.  Along with the family's temperamental pet dog Sammy Davis, Jr., Jr. (named after Grandfather's favorite singer - and played wonderfully by canine actors Mikki and Mouse), this disparate group of individuals cram themselves into a small car and set off across the Ukrainian countryside in search of a town no one seems to have heard of before.  Many discoveries are to be made on this trip, as the past reasserts itself in some really heart-breaking ways.  That's all I'm going to say about the plot - just trust me when I say it is astonishingly deep and emotionally powerful.Don't get the idea that this is some exceedingly morose film because it does have a number of lighter moments, most of them provided by Alex and his unique translation skills.  The musical score is also a joy to hear, with its delightful mix of Eastern European styles and sounds.  There is no more plaintive or soulful music in the world, and it serves as a powerful complement to the story playing out on screen.In my opinion, Everything is Illuminated is a brilliant film, one of the best I've seen in some time.  Give this movie a chance, and it will touch your heart in ways you may never have experienced before.

He went to America during WW2 and when came back to get his wife, was killed for ""betraying"" his country.Also, just so you know, the word they used for Jew was a Russian slogan that still means a Jew and IS NOT a descriminative word, just a slogan people are used to...Also, for those who claim some scenes humanly unrealistic, well, when my grandma came to America, first thing she asked when arrived in 1998 was ""Is the war really over?"".

174030,ASQ8KNNP3A7FP,1419802356,"Danusha V. Goska ""Save Send Delete""","[11, 28]","""Everything is Illuminated"" is an embarrassingly bad stinker on almost every count, with two exceptions: Eugene Hutz is weirdly, wildly charismatic as Alex, a goofy young Ukrainian who imagines himself a hip-hop star. And ""Everything Is Illuminated""'s score is excellent, consisting, as it does, of authentic Eastern European folk music.The first half of ""Everything Is Illuminated"" consists of g-rated versions of ""Borat"" jokes. Ukrainians are funny because they try to be cool like Americans. Ukrainians are laughable because they speak English in a simple-minded pidgin, calling ""African Americans"" ""Negroes,"" for example, and saying ""repose"" for ""sleep."" Ukrainians are funny because of their sex lives. Ukrainians are also dirty, irrationally and by nature violent, they hate Jews, they wear unattractive clothing; the men are ready to beat up any newcomer to their town nave enough to ask for driving directions; the women are either cowed housewives married to husbands and fathers who lead with their fists, or slatternly, sullen, obese waitresses; goat-herding Ukrainian children engage in mindless vandalism like flattening car tires. These folks are so debased that even their dogs are ugly, stupid, and vicious. Yup, there's even a creepy household pet. Of course these comically stupid, ugly, crude yokels are responsible for the Holocaust. At one point, Elijah Wood, as Jonathan Safran Foer, insists that the Ukraine was as bad as Nazi Germany.This nasty stereotype is not the invention of Liev Schreiber, the director and script writer. Schreiber and Safran Foer, the author of the book on which the film is based, are merely exploiting, not inventing, hateful ethnic stereotypes. The image of the brutal Eastern European peasant has been around for centuries. Americans are most familiar with this stereotype from Polak jokes and the film ""Borat.""Eugene Hutz is genuinely funny in his thankless, Eastern European ""Amos-and-Andy""-style role. He acts the Ukrainian dunce with as much grace and dignity as possible, and is the only thing worth watching in the film. Some scenes are laugh out loud funny, especially when Wood lectures Hutz on the use of the term ""African American."" But ""Amos and Andy"" was funny, too.After about an hour of Bohunk jokes, ""Everything Is Illuminated"" abruptly turns off the comedy tap and turns into a turgid, static Holocaust film. What little action there was in the film, provided by Hutz's kinetic mugging, shuffling, and jiving, or by Ukrainians punching other Ukrainians, stops. Characters stand still and offer speeches about horrible things that happened in the past. Jonathan and Alex arrive at the one pleasant house, with the one dignified resident, in all of Ukraine. The colorful cottage is out of a Disney fairy tale. Clean laundry snaps on the line. Orderly rows of sunflowers surround the home. The peasant woman living in the cottage is gracious and lovely. Aha. She's not really Ukrainian. She's Jewish.On the other hand, Elijah Wood, as Jonathan Safran Foer, a modern American Jew, comes off no better than the stereotyped Ukrainians. He, too, is a stereotype: the uptight, obsessional, neurotic, socially backward, weak, frightened, passive Jew. Wood, as Jonathan, is so stiff he could be playing a corpse. A writer and director should have a very sound aesthetic reason for making the Jewish character in a film about the Holocaust a passive Jew. Scheiber has no good reason. He's just playing two stereotypes against each other, insisting that one needn't learn anything from one of the most horrendous crimes in history in order to make a film about it. Given that there is a very self-destructive death of another Jewish character in the movie, Wood's passivity is even more troubling.The Holocaust is never honored by ""Everything Is Illuminated."" In the unlikely event that this is the only Holocaust film the viewer ever sees, that viewer would have no idea what the Holocaust was. As slow, pretentious, and ponderous as this film is, it never for one moment manages to convey the monumental horror and heartbreak of the Holocaust.Again, I'd love to see Eugene Hutz in just about any new film; meanwhile, I've been watching youtube videos of his band, ""Gogol Bordello.""

174031,A2I2DE1DJUVQOO,1419802356,DarthRad,"[5, 9]","This was one of seven movies that I watched on board a long round trip Qantas airplane flight recently.The beginning half of the movie has some very funny moments and is a basic clash-of-cultures and fracturing-of-the-English language type comedy.Eugene Hutz, playing the role of an earnest Ukrainian tour guide, really steals the show and is terrific.  Mikki the dog, as the deranged ""seeing eye b**tch"" is also hilariously funny.Boris Leskin turns in a fine performance as the grandfather, but his role is unfortunately largely wasted as the story arc of his character takes some sudden, rather inexplicable turns that don't really add up.Elijah Wood is completely wasted in this role.  Somebody, probably the director or screenwriter, decided to put him in a black suit and large glasses for almost the entire movie, while wearing this constant look of solemn angst on his face.  His movements are almost catatonic, as he goes about collecting weird bits of mementos in plastic ziplock bags.Wood has tended to specialize in two types of characters, and in this movie, he comes across not like his sympathetic, humane Frodo (LOTR), or Leo Beiderman (Deep Impact), but ends up more like the creepy Kevin the Cannibal (Sin City), or Patrick the Girlfriend Stealer (Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind).  If you have ever watched Sin City, the picture of Wood with the large reflective glasses on the DVD cover will definitely remind you of Kevin the Cannibal.  And unfortunately, that's what I had in mind as I was watching this movie.The cinematography is beautiful in parts.  Reading the many five star reviews, it is apparent that the most appealing aspects of this movie to most people are its themes of remembrance for the victims of Nazi aggression in this part of the world, plus its rare Hollywood look at the Eastern European world.But, I'm not from that part of the world, and those themes just don't resonate that deeply with me.  On its own merits as entertainment, this movie was funny in the first half, sad in the second half, and the two parts just don't mesh well together.

A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[180, 186]","On very rare occasions, it's a good idea not to follow the book.Jonathan Safran Foer's cult novel ""Everything Is Illuminated"" has a wild chronology, and the journey is sprinkled with magical realism and countless flashbacks to minor characters. It COULD be crammed into a film, but it would not be a very accessible one. In fact, it might be almost unwatchable.Enter actor Liev Schreiber, who chopped out much of the backstory and focused on the ""road movie in the Ukraine"" storyline. No, it's not like the book. But taken on its own, ""Everything Is Illuminated"" is a a striking, humorous and poignant film. Schreiber should be proud.Jonathan (Elijah Wood) has a funny fixation about remembering the past, which includes putting life souvenirs in plastic baggies and taping them to the wall. So his curiosity is piqued when his grandmother tells him of Augustina, a woman who rescued his grandfather during World War II. With only a ring and a photo to guide him, Jonathan travels to the Ukraine to find Augustine.He's met at the station by Alex (Eugene Hutz), a hip-hop tour guide who speaks his own peculiar dialect, Alex's weird, melancholy grandad (Stephen Samudovsky), and grandad's ""seeing eye b*tch."" As they search the Ukraine for Augustine, if she is still alive, Jonathan begins to learn about the ways the past infringes on the present -- and a bit about himself as well.Schreiber apparently decided to adapt ""Everything Is Illuminated"" when he began to chronicle his own family history, and discovered that it was strikingly similar to Foer's novel. For a beloved cult novel, editing and reshaping is a risky business. But in Schreiber's case, it becomes a whole different animal -- it retains the spirit of the original, if not the sense of history.While this is Liev Schreiber's directorial debut, it doesn't feel like one. Instead, it feels polished and experienced, with beautiful cinematography that ranges from night skies to a field of dazzling sunflowers. In sepia-toned flashbacks, Schreiber follows the less-is-more rule by merely hinting at the Holocaust's horrors, which is, oddly enough, more effective.And his script has pathos and anguish, but also plenty of humour (most of it provided by Hutz), such as the scene where he tries to figure out what a vegetarian is, prompting Wood to tell him firmly ""Nothing! No meat!""... only to have both men ask what's wrong with him. The only problem is that at times the road-trip format gets a bit precious, and the storyline stalls once or twice.Elijah Wood gives a remarkably subtle performance as a quiet, slightly neurotic young man who seems to be searching for something in the past to make him complete. Hutz balances him out with the colourful, slightly wonky Alex. He's both comic relief and a sort of wiser older brother for Jonathan. The plot revolves around these two, and they are balanced out well.Okay, it's not the book. But then again, it really doesn't pretend to be. Instead, Liev Schreiber's ""Everything Is Illuminated"" is a bittersweet comedy that will leave you with a smile.",4,"Almost ""Everything"" is illuminated",1134864000,"12 18, 2005",2005,3064,"['very', 'rare', 'occasions', 'good', 'idea', 'not', 'follow', 'book.Jonathan', 'Safran', 'Foer', 'cult', 'Everything', 'Illuminated', 'wild', 'chronology', 'journey', 'sprinkled', 'magical', 'realism', 'countless', 'flashbacks', 'minor', 'characters', 'COULD', 'be', 'crammed', 'film', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'very', 'accessible', 'one', 'fact', 'might', 'be', 'almost', 'unwatchable.Enter', 'actor', 'Liev', 'Schreiber', 'who', 'chopped', 'out', 'much', 'backstory', 'focused', 'road', 'movie', 'Ukraine', 'storyline', 'No', 'not', 'book', 'taken', 'own', 'Everything', 'Illuminated', 'striking', 'humorous', 'poignant', 'film', 'Schreiber', 'should', 'be', 'proud.Jonathan', 'Elijah', 'Wood', 'funny', 'fixation', 'remembering', 'past', 'putting', 'life', 'souvenirs', 'plastic', 'baggies', 'taping', 'wall', 'curiosity', 'piqued', 'when', 'grandmother', 'Augustina', 'woman', 'who', 'rescued', 'grandfather', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'only', 'ring', 'photo', 'guide', 'Jonathan', 'Ukraine', 'find', 'Augustine.He', 'met', 'station', 'Alex', 'Eugene', 'Hutz', 'hip-hop', 'tour', 'guide', 'who', 'own', 'peculiar', 'dialect', 'Alex', 'weird', 'melancholy', 'grandad', 'Stephen', 'Samudovsky', 'grandad', 'seeing', 'eye', 'b*tch', 'search', 'Ukraine', 'Augustine', 'still', 'alive', 'Jonathan', 'learn', 'ways', 'past', 'infringes', 'present', 'bit', 'about', 'well.Schreiber', 'apparently', 'decided', 'adapt', 'Everything', 'Illuminated', 'when', 'began', 'chronicle', 'own', 'family', 'history', 'discovered', 'was', 'strikingly', 'similar', 'Foer', 'novel', 'beloved', 'cult', 'novel', 'editing', 'reshaping', 'risky', 'business', 'Schreiber', 'case', 'whole', 'different', 'animal', 'spirit', 'original', 'not', 'sense', 'history.While', 'Liev', 'Schreiber', 'directorial', 'debut', ""n't"", 'feel', 'one', 'Instead', 'polished', 'experienced', 'beautiful', 'cinematography', 'night', 'skies', 'field', 'dazzling', 'sunflowers', 'sepia-toned', 'flashbacks', 'Schreiber', 'less-is-more', 'rule', 'merely', 'hinting', 'Holocaust', 'horrors', 'oddly', 'enough', 'more', 'effective.And', 'script', 'pathos', 'anguish', 'also', 'plenty', 'humour', 'most', 'provided', 'Hutz', 'such', 'scene', 'where', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'vegetarian', 'prompting', 'Wood', 'tell', 'firmly', 'Nothing', 'meat', 'only', 'have', 'men', 'ask', 'what', 'wrong', 'only', 'problem', 'times', 'road-trip', 'format', 'bit', 'precious', 'storyline', 'once', 'twice.Elijah', 'Wood', 'remarkably', 'subtle', 'performance', 'quiet', 'slightly', 'neurotic', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'be', 'searching', 'something', 'past', 'make', 'complete', 'Hutz', 'out', 'colourful', 'slightly', 'wonky', 'Alex', 'comic', 'relief', 'sort', 'wiser', 'older', 'brother', 'Jonathan', 'plot', 'two', 'are', 'balanced', 'well.Okay', 'not', 'book', 'then', 'again', 'really', ""n't"", 'pretend', 'be', 'Instead', 'Liev', 'Schreiber', 'Everything', 'Illuminated', 'bittersweet', 'comedy', 'will', 'leave', 'smile']",N/A

Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[0, 0]","EVERYTHING IS ILLUMINATED [BY THE LIGHT OF OUR PAST], a strange 2004 offering directed by Liev Schreiber, is one of those films that can leave me tongue-tied for quite a few years. Though I knew Jonathan Foer, main character in this film and author of the original novel, had a tv show on cable about atheism, I knew nothing of the novel itself. Judging by the reviews, I'm glad I did not ever read it. It produced this fairly even, well directed first effort by Schreiber, who must have struggled a lot with the original storyline and characters to do the adaptation so well.Jonathan (Elijah Wood in his last actual film role of consequence) is a collector of mementos from relatives but is also a wannabe collector of memories/experiences. His grandmother tells him a few things on her deathbed, and presents him with a photo. The girl in the photo with Jonathan's grandfather is a girl who would later ""save"" him from the NAZI invasion of the Ukraine. At this time Jonathan decides to go to the Ukraine to find where his ancestors' shtetl (Trachimbrod) was, though this is a fogged fact in the movie and would be hard for most Americans to comprehend.In Ukraine Jonathan hooks up with the head of Heritage Tours out of Odessa, old Alex (Boris Leskin, MEN IN BLACK, THE HOUSE ON CARROLL STREET see my review), and his grandson also named Alex (Eugene Hutz, real-life leader of some sort of rock band). Old Alex's dog offers some comic relief as does young Alex, whose English reminds me of my cousins from Chicago. Old Alex reminds me of my father.Though this film is billed as a ""road trip"" movie, I hesitate to call it such. It is a ""dramedy"" as we used to call them, full of serious feelings and oddly malapropos humor in weird places. At the start of the drive to find the location of the shtetl, Old Alex gets impatient and hollers at his grandson that perhaps he ought to leave him and Jonathan to ""f*** yourselves"". Yet there are deeply emotional moments that I was able to understand. Jonathan's floundering, autistic personality reminded me of myself as a young man--the culture clash he feels in the Ukraine is also familiar to me.There is a young fellow with a leaf-blower, a cemetery employee, who appears in a scene with Wood and looks exactly like him. That fellow is Jonathan Foer, just so you know. Otherwise...if you have not seen this movie, I will not spoil the ending for you. It is a surprise, keen, elegant and sharp.

In a larger sense, it is a movie about identity--that of each character (Jonathan, Alex the grandson, Alex the grandfather, the woman sought) and even that of the movie viewer, since it is difficult to leave this film detached and unaffected.  Elijah Wood plays Jonathan, ""the collector,"" a Jewish American who goes over to the Ukraine in search of a mysterious woman he saw in a photo with his deceased grandfather.  He hooks up with a family business, ""Heritage Tours,"" that drives around Jews seeking to uncover their family history.  Cranky grandfather Alex drives (even though he says he's blind), Americaphile grandson Alex translates, and dog Sammy Davis Jr., Jr. (no typo) rides along, as Jonathan is taken to look for the woman.

Walking the fine line between comedy and drama, the film succeeds by not straying too far in either direction. It deals with difficult topics such as the holocaust, racism, and self-image.

I only knew that the film starred Elijah Wood and was actor Liev Schreiber's directing debut and it sounded interesting from descriptions I read. So my expectations were pretty modest. I certainly did not expect Schreiber to hit one out of the park his first time up to bat. However, Everything Is Illuminated is indeed a home run and one of the best movies of the year, in my opinion.Elijah Wood is excellent as Jonathan, a rather odd fellow obsessed with collecting things, particularly as mementos of the past. He travels to the Ukraine and learns a great deal about life, himself, and the future by searching for the past. Also a standout is Eugene Hutz as Jonathan's Ukrainian guide who digs Michael Jackson and wants to be an accountant. Hutz is apparently not an actor, he is the leader of a popular rock band. However, you would never know that he's not an actor, his performance is excellent. The first half of Everything is Illuminated is very humorous, the second half very dramatic. However, the change is tone is very slight. The humor is very funny and the drama is equally potent. The later scenes are very moving and heartfelt without every sinking into cloying sentimentality. The movie from beginning to end is beautifully directed, with wonderful cinematography showcasing the lovely Ukrainian countryside. Schreiber seems to have a very good feeling for visual style. At times it almost reminded of one of my favorite visual stylists: Jean-Pierre Jeunet.Everything Is Illuminated is a wonderful movie. Well directed, well written, well acted, and with it's heart in exactly the right place. It will make you laugh, it will make you cry, it will make you think. Very few directorial debuts turn out this good. In 2004, Zach Braff unleashed Garden State and became an unlikely wunderkind director, in 2005 Liev Schreiber has done the same. This is one of 2005's best movies.

The author adopts the conceit that this is an autobiographical tale in which he returns to the Odessa Region of the Ukraine to seek for information about his roots. Everything about this tale is eccentric. The stilted language derives from the author's own Yiddish Roots and the ideas about English supplied by his Russian Interpreter Alex--a tall awkward lad Jonathan's age. His driver, Alex' Grandfather, is blind employing a ""seeing-eye"" bitch, a small dog with attitude that ends up sharing the back seat with Jonathan and later his bed. Jonathan is a 'collector' who saves baggies of dirt,  even that supplied him for his gamma's grave, her false teeth, photographs, a broach containing a grasshopper in amber, all of it pinned to the wall of his bedroom. The old two-cycle Russian Car they drive with a tour guide sign up top totters along always on the verge of failure but it somehow manages to negotiate superhighways, dirt roads, and paths with the grass growing between the ruts. At one point a young goatherd sticks a small pebble in the valve-stem of the back tire flattening it. There is disbelief all round when their guest announces he is vegetarian--what, no sausage?This is one in any number of tales related by second and third generation American Jews seeking out their roots in communities purged of their ancestors by the Nazi Holocaust.

174045,AAEP8YFERQ8FC,1419802356,General Breadbasket,"[2, 2]","Elijah Wood stars in ""Everything is Illuminated"", a rather quirky film, apparently based on Jonathan Safran Foer's book of the same name.Elijah Wood plays Jonathan Safran Foer, a young Jewish guy who is quiet, awkward and prides himself on being something of a collector. He collects bits and pieces that evoke memories of his family, anything from a piece of jewelery, to a handful of dirt, even pieces of food - anything that was there during the many and varied moments of their lives as well as his own. He's not exactly sure why he does it, it's just something to do. Jonathan's collecting takes him to the Ukraine, to find the woman who saved his grandfather's life during the second world war. With the help of a tour guide who can speak ""premium English"", and the guide's near-blind grandfather to drive them both, Jonathan makes his way across the beautiful country. As they go, there is many a discovery, many a culture shock and many a shocking revelation.It took me a little while to get into the film, but I liked it when I did. It was mainly the sense of humour that it took time to key into, and the slightly odd characters. Everyone plays their part well, particularly the Ukranian cast, who seemed very genuine indeed. The scenery is lush and beautiful, and its filmed very nicely. The Ukraine itself is also a star of this movie, I think. Though I couldn't understand the lyrics (I don't speak Russian, but I'd like to), the music playing on and off in the background was pretty neat, and fit the atmosphere of the film well. There's a lot of emotion in the film, and it all ebbs and flows well. There's the occaisonal arty flourish in terms of direction, but I don't think it gets too pretentious anywhere.Special features include the original theatrical trailer and a lengthy montage of deleted scenes. The most notable of these includes a fantasy of Jonathan's while at his grandfather's funeral, where he receives an award from Hitler for keeping the most comprehensive record from his family. Among the crowd at this fantasy awards ceremony are famous faces like Mother Theresa and Gandhi.

The only drawback I have is with the editting.At the most poignant moment of the story, I had to pick up the remote and rewind a few times to figure out what I missed.  The key scene in the movie started off right with an explanation and then switched to a flashback, but I was thrown off by a confusing figure in the background.  Who was the girl with the basket?  Was it sister A or sister B?  One reviewer mentioned that Shreiber's less-is-more approach served him well in this movie, and I completely agree.  However, with this particular scene a little ""more"", might have been helpful.In the special features, there are 7 deleted scenes labeled ""additional scenes"". Minus the first and the last deleted scenes, all the other ones could have been left in the movie to give the film that extra comic punch. They were great! The journey itself is a little wacky anyway so might as well make it as humorous as possible.  Therefore, when it does start to get serious, the poignant moments sink in much more meaningfully.I also would avoid watching the trailer since it gives the story away with a key frame.Not bad for Shreiber's directorial debut.  He's got great potential.  I like his unique less-is-more approach, but not all of it has to be less.  Excellent use of lighting for intimate scenes.  He's got a hell of an eye for cinematography.

174050,A328S9RN3U5M68,1419802356,Grady Harp,"[6, 7]","Jonathan Safran Foer's widely read novel 'Everything is Illuminated' was a zany concoction of story, standup comedy, and fantasy that worked well as a diversion because of Foer's very apparent rough style of writing: everything is forgiven if the words play with the imagination.  But as a film the book seemed a formidable undertaking.  Liev Schreiber, a consummate actor, adapted Foer's book for the screen, performing major surgery on the tale, and then directed his version with great skill.  The result is a film that always entertains but that also crosses lines between reality and fantasy, writer's intentions vs screenwriter's needs, and story manipulation that may please some and frustrate those who loved the book.Jonathan Safran Foer (Elijah Wood) is a collector of familial trinkets who sets out to the Ukraine to discover teasers of how his Jewish grandfather escaped annihilation in the Ukraine at the kindness of one Augustine (Tereza Veselkova). Once in the Ukraine he hires a tour guide Alex (Eugene Hutz) who with his 'blind' grandfather (Boris Leskin) as driver and their bizarre dog Sammy Davis Jr. Jr. to take him to Trachimbrod, the site where Foer's grandfather knew Augustine.  It seems there is no such place, and the journey to wherever begins.  Alex mangles his English with malapropisms and strange word substitutions making his job as translator for Foer the high point of the road trip (as it made the original book the reason to read!).  The many entanglements the strange little group encounter in their drive results in finding the secrets Foer is seeking and he is able to return home satisfied with his journey.All this makes for an acceptable road trip comedy until Schreiber excises the bulk of the novel - the bits of history that make the eventual discovery of the truths Foer seeks more meaningful.  And while the novel never lets the comedy slip off line, the screenplay switches gears and makes the story another tender yet sad holocaust tale. But despite the completed film's ending, the DVD shows the plentiful scenes not included in the film, scenes that are as over the top and barking for laughter as Foer's crazy novel.  We should only be grateful that Schreiber has the sense to delete these costly production numbers, as they are indeed silly!Eugene Hutz (born in 1972 Yevhen Hudz in Kiev, Ukraine) is the true find of the film.  His 'acting experience' is solely as the 'front man for Gogol Bordello, a gypsy punk band fusing supercharged folk influences with a sideshow cabaret'.  But he manages the wildly maniacal yet strangely intuitive character and lines of Alex with great finesse. He is a treasure!  The rest of the cast is strong and the splendid musical score by Paul Cantelon and the cinematography by Matthew Libatique add immeasurably to the film.Though many may disagree with  Schrieber's manipulation of the book, few will be able to miss the fact that for a first outing as writer/director EVERYTHING IS ILLUMINATED is a fine start.

That driver's ""seeing eye[...],"" Sammy Davis Jr. Jr., is pretty funny, too.  At the same time, this is one of the most meaningful, touching, and poignantly sad films to come out in the past several years.Is the film confusing, as some say?  Only if you're not really watching, or if you expect director Liev Schrieber to serve up everything on a plate for you.  My wife and I spent at least a couple of hours after seeing the film discussing what was meant by various scenes, especially the flashbacks, which made the whole thing a richer, more meaningful experience for us both.Also worth noting is that the film IS quite different from the book, but that's not a bad thing.  Liev Schriber has done a wonderful job of telling the whole story by focusing on the personality of the main character and the central event that changes his life, then leaving the rest to your imagination. If he had, instead, tried to SHOW how that character became what he is, the film would have lost much of its charismatic appeal.Last, after you watch the film, be sure to watch the deleted scenes in the Special Features section.  They, too, are hilarious, but what impressed me the most was the grand scale (and presumed cost) of some of the scenes they left out.  And, in this case, seeing what they cut enhances the parts they left in.  That is, I could see how it must have been  tempting to include some of the more explanatory deleted scenes to make the film ""easier,"" but I ended up appreciating Schrieber's deft use of understatement all the more.",5,"Thought-Provoking, Tragic, and Hilarious",1170806400,"02 7, 2007",2007,1877,"['hard', 'decide', 'funnier', 'Ukranian', 'translator', 'who', 'learned', 'English', 'thesaurus', 'main', 'character', 'who', 'dirt', 'false', 'teeth', 'potato', 'hundreds', 'other', 'odd', 'objects', 'connected', 'life', 'ziplock', 'bags', 'Ukranian', 'grandfather', 'who', 'be', 'blind', 'even', 'tourist', 'countryside', 'driver', 'seeing', 'eye', '[', ']', 'Sammy', 'Davis', 'Jr.', 'Jr.', 'pretty', 'funny', 'too', 'same', 'time', 'one', 'most', 'meaningful', 'touching', 'poignantly', 'sad', 'films', 'come', 'out', 'past', 'several', 'film', 'confusing', 'say', 'Only', ""'re"", 'not', 'really', 'watching', 'expect', 'director', 'Liev', 'Schrieber', 'serve', 'up', 'everything', 'plate', 'wife', 'spent', 'least', 'couple', 'hours', 'seeing', 'film', 'discussing', 'what', 'was', 'meant', 'various', 'scenes', 'especially', 'flashbacks', 'made', 'whole', 'thing', 'richer', 'more', 'meaningful', 'experience', 'both.Also', 'worth', 'noting', 'film', 'IS', 'quite', 'different', 'book', 'not', 'bad', 'thing', 'Liev', 'Schriber', 'done', 'wonderful', 'job', 'telling', 'whole', 'story', 'focusing', 'personality', 'main', 'character', 'central', 'event', 'life', 'then', 'leaving', 'rest', 'imagination', 'had', 'instead', 'tried', 'SHOW', 'how', 'character', 'became', 'what', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'lost', 'much', 'charismatic', 'appeal.Last', 'watch', 'film', 'be', 'sure', 'watch', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'Special', 'Features', 'section', 'too', 'are', 'hilarious', 'what', 'impressed', 'most', 'was', 'grand', 'scale', 'presumed', 'cost', 'scenes', 'left', 'out', 'case', 'seeing', 'what', 'cut', 'parts', 'left', 'could', 'see', 'how', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'tempting', 'include', 'more', 'explanatory', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'make', 'film', 'easier', 'ended', 'up', 'appreciating', 'Schrieber', 'deft', 'use', 'understatement', 'more']",N/A

While I haven't read the book - or, for that matter, heard of its existence prior to watching the film - and therefore cannot, like some other reviewers, comment on how they stack up in comparison, Everything Is Illuminated gave me great pleasure, and I can certainly comment on that.To label Everything Is Illuminated a holocaust film would be to do it great injustice, even though it is undeniably about the holocaust. So would labeling it as a comedy or a travel film, although it's about a journey and is as exceptionally funny as it is moving. Everything Is Illuminated is about Jonathan Safran Foer - played to minimalist perfection by Elijah Wood, in the most impressive dramatic performance I've seen him in yet, with a poker face that shows nothing and reveals all - a young American Jew, and an obsessive collector of family heirlooms and historical artifacts, who travels to the Ukraine on a journey to find the woman who saved his grandfather from the Nazis. It's also about Alex, his tour guide through the Ukraine, and Alex's grandfather. What's fascinating about these characters is that in the beginning of the film they look like comic relief to balance out the melancholy nature of Wood's character; but both Alex and his grandfather go through fascinating changes throughout the film, and turn out to be at least as important as Jonathan. In fact, Boris Leskin's as the grumpy, self-declared blind grandfather turns out to be the finest dramatic performance in the film.Aside from the surreal nature of the film and the characters, the beautiful mix of original acoustic music and Russian folk music, the sensitive cinematography and the chilling contrast between the beauty of the landscapes and the horrors of history, what made Everything Is Illuminated a powerful and moving experience for me was the fact that from Alex and his grandfather we get a very different and original viewpoint on this painful subject; several excellent films, such as The Grey Zone and Downfall, have already given us the point of view of the lower-rank Nazis who are presented as human beings who aren't necessarily fully aware of the moral implications of their actions but are caught up in the reality of the war. Everything Is Illuminated presents a point of view rarely treated before: Alex's point of view is that of a young man who was born many years after the war, who sees it as hardly more than cold historical fact, who finds himself having to face up to the horrors his own people - and maybe his own family as well - were capable of. The change in Alex's attitude - and his grandfather's - towards Jonathan, towards the Holocaust, and towards the Jewish people in general, makes the film a fascinating and original study in character development.Everything Is Illuminated is a terrific directorial debut for actor Liev Schreiber, and one of the most original and unique films of 2005.

174058,A1EBJ93E1T50RT,1419802356,Jason A. Miller,"[20, 21]","There are two ways to look at Liev Schrieber's directorial debut.  First, how does it compare to the source material?  And second, is it any good?What's best known about the Schreiber movie thus far is that the director omitted a significant portion of author Jonathan Safran Foer's novel.  The magical realism flashbacks to the Ukrainian shtetl of Trachimbrod -- a major chunk of the book -- have been completely excised (except for a couple of mentions of the name Sofiowka, a name on the map and also an important character in the novel).  Additionally, the book is mostly structured as a series of letters written to author Foer by his Ukrainian translator Alex.  Most of that structure is jettisoned, although the movie does retain chapter titles.  Thus, Alex is the movie's sole narrator.That's a good thing.  Eugene Hutz, reminiscent of John Turturro (of ""The Big Lebowski"" vintage, not ""Barton Fink"" or ""Quiz Show""), commands the movie.  Elijah Wood channels Tobey Maguire's socially awkward Peter Parker more than his own reluctant hero Frodo Baggins.  But the movie is not so much about Foer as it is about Alex and his grandfather, and what they learn from escorting Foer around the remains of the shtetl.Significant changes have been made to the book's ending, mostly in the interest of clarity and time.  The book's late revelations about both Alexes, grandfather and grandson, are condensed or omitted.  These changes in the script do not destroy the book's integrity.  Roy Hobbs does not suddenly knock the ball off the light towers, or play catch with his son over the credits.  The ending is still moving, downbeat but serene.Finally, is it good?  Absolutely.  The Ukrainian landscape, and what appears to be regular use of steadicam, makes for a visually striking directorial debut.  The cast is small and uniformly excellent.  The soundtrack mirrors the movie's varied tones.  It takes a sure director to navigate the novel's blend of slapstick comedy and emotional devestation.  Schreiber, after condensing the novel, follows a steady progression from slapstick to devestation, and never sells either the book or its characters short.In the end, a compelling work, and hopefully one that will not be entirely ignored by the Motion Picture Academy.",4,The Commencement to a Very Rigid Entertainment,1127606400,"09 25, 2005",2005,2267,"['are', 'two', 'ways', 'look', 'Liev', 'Schrieber', 'directorial', 'debut', 'First', 'how', 'compare', 'source', 'material', 'second', 'good', 'What', 'best', 'known', 'Schreiber', 'movie', 'thus', 'far', 'director', 'omitted', 'significant', 'portion', 'author', 'Jonathan', 'Safran', 'Foer', 'novel', 'magical', 'realism', 'flashbacks', 'Ukrainian', 'shtetl', 'Trachimbrod', 'major', 'chunk', 'book', 'have', 'been', 'completely', 'excised', 'couple', 'mentions', 'name', 'Sofiowka', 'name', 'map', 'also', 'important', 'character', 'novel', 'Additionally', 'book', 'mostly', 'structured', 'series', 'letters', 'written', 'author', 'Foer', 'Ukrainian', 'translator', 'Alex', 'Most', 'structure', 'jettisoned', 'movie', 'retain', 'chapter', 'titles', 'Thus', 'Alex', 'movie', 'sole', 'narrator.That', 'good', 'thing', 'Eugene', 'Hutz', 'reminiscent', 'John', 'Turturro', 'Big', 'Lebowski', 'vintage', 'not', 'Barton', 'Fink', 'Quiz', 'Show', 'movie', 'Elijah', 'Wood', 'channels', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'socially', 'awkward', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'more', 'own', 'reluctant', 'hero', 'Frodo', 'Baggins', 'movie', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'Foer', 'Alex', 'grandfather', 'what', 'learn', 'escorting', 'Foer', 'remains', 'shtetl.Significant', 'changes', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'book', 'ending', 'mostly', 'interest', 'clarity', 'time', 'book', 'late', 'revelations', 'Alexes', 'grandfather', 'grandson', 'are', 'condensed', 'omitted', 'changes', 'script', 'do', 'not', 'destroy', 'book', 'integrity', 'Roy', 'Hobbs', 'not', 'suddenly', 'knock', 'ball', 'light', 'towers', 'play', 'catch', 'son', 'credits', 'ending', 'still', 'moving', 'downbeat', 'serene.Finally', 'good', 'Absolutely', 'Ukrainian', 'landscape', 'what', 'be', 'regular', 'use', 'steadicam', 'visually', 'striking', 'directorial', 'debut', 'cast', 'small', 'uniformly', 'excellent', 'soundtrack', 'movie', 'varied', 'tones', 'sure', 'director', 'navigate', 'novel', 'blend', 'slapstick', 'comedy', 'emotional', 'devestation', 'Schreiber', 'condensing', 'novel', 'steady', 'progression', 'slapstick', 'devestation', 'never', 'book', 'characters', 'short.In', 'end', 'compelling', 'work', 'hopefully', 'one', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'entirely', 'ignored', 'Motion', 'Picture', 'Academy']",N/A
174059,AOKKY21CAQVGM,1419802356,Jim&Yvonne,"[5, 6]","Liev Schrieber (actor in ""Manchurian Candidate (2004)"" among many other roles) made his directorial debut with this film based on a book by Jonathan Safran Foer.  Schrieber also did the screenplay (adaptation) from novel to screen.  The film stars Elijah Wood and some other actors that no one really heard of.  It cost about seven million to make, but only brought in about 1.6 million.  I hope that DVD sales will bring that number up.  I never heard of it (the film), so I suppose it was limited released film-Which is too bad, because it would of been worth its price at the box office.  The movie is about a Jewish American who travels to the Ukraine to find some ancestral information, also he is a collector of ancestral objects ranging from false teeth to money to pictures, etc.  I don't know why the film cost seven million to make, I guess everyone wanted to get paid and it was filmed in the Ukraine-But it was an independent film that was glorious to watch.  Please excuse the comparison, but it was a light hearted ""Schindlers List"" or any other dramatic Holocaust film-If there can be.  People take things for granted, lose their ancestral history and this film portrayed not just Wood's ability find what he needed, but another to remember and accept what his past was.  The film again, is somewhat lighthearted, comical at times, but really, it isn't.  I believe it just seems that way because the Ukraine has just been adopting Western culture (good or bad, not the judge), and there were scenes in this adoption that was just funny, not because they meant it, but because that is how it is over there.  Schreiber did an excellent job in picking up this culture change as well as the emotional moments of the film, whether subliminal or in your face.  Wood, who I haven't really liked in anything lately did a great job in this film-He was perfect for this role.  The Ukrainians who participated in this film were very good as well, especially that of Eugene Hutz as Alex.  I don't know how these actors learn to direct, some are really good, some are awful, but Schrieber had an excellent eye for the big picture as well as small details-His ability to put this wonderful book (assuming, I will read it now) on film and tell the tale as he understood it was phenomenal.

174061,A1LVZOK9F7K4CN,1419802356,JR Pinto,"[9, 14]","Milan Kundera once wrote that modern novelists should write in such a way that their books should be un-filmable - that the essence of the novel should be something that can't translate to the screen.  Jonathan Safran Foer certainly took his advice in writing Everything is Illuminated: a metafictional novel with a ton of bells and whistles that couldn't translate to the screen.  It certainly seemed un-filmable...and then they went and filmed it.  If I were to assign a director for such a task, it would have been someone like David Fincher who (with Fight Club) proved that he could take literary tricks and give us their cinematic equivalents.  Instead, we have Liev Schreiber - an actor who uses this project for his first attempt at being a writer AND director (he's never done either before).  The results are mixed.The novel had three different storylines: there was the correspondence from Alex to Jonathan, there was the history of the shtetl of Trachimbrod, and there was the main story of the modern-day journey (""a very rigid search"") for Trachimbrod.  In order to make the story filmable, Schrieber has only retained the modern-day storyline and ignored all the metafictional gimmicks: thus we are left with about two or three dimensions out of twenty.DOES THE MOVIE WORK ON ITS OWN MERITS?  Kind of.  It's funny.  The best character is Alex Perchov, played by Eugene Hutz who - in real life - is a non-actor; he's the front man for a gypsy/punk/folk band (his song plays over the ending credits).  He was the funniest character in the book and he makes a good transition to the screen: a track-suit-wearing, gold-chained-and-toothed Ukrainian hip hop kid who speaks his own unique brand of English.  Most of the humor comes from the culture clash between him and Jonathan.  The character of Jonathan is drastically changed for the screen.  Schreiber makes him come across like the creepy intern undertaker from Six Feet Under.  He puts huge glasses over Elijah Wood's already-huge eyes, making him look like a cartoon character.What doesn't work is the emotional center of the film.  It feels like something is missing.  It goes from light comedy to tragedy, but the tragedy isn't done well.  This is perhaps because they COMPLETELY changed the ending of the book.  They not only removed the bells and whistles - they also removed its heart.  The character of the grandfather gets totally changed, so no one really gets his epiphany at the end (even if you have read the book).  I don't understand why this was done - perhaps it was thought the ending was too much of a downer.Everything is Illuminated isn't a bad film.

It is witty and well acted, but the most important thing about it is the evocative tension created by the story and the cinematography.The movie, in all relevant dimensions, establishes and explores a number of basic tensions between life and death, old and new, beautiful and ugly, sad and humorous, smart and stupid, grand and small, and feelings and senses.  It is just beautiful and completely captivating in the same way as the Ukraine itself.What I enjoy most is the outright honesty in which this movie captures the paradoxes and essences of a Ukraine searching for itself in this modern world.I had the unique experience of visiting Kiev recently and I was awed by its purity and its strangeness.  There is the old way of life and the new way of life. Also there is the ugliness of Communism and the pride of something new.  Finally, there is the traditional way of Ukrainian life, which is little changed in the villages and farms, versus the struggle for modernity in the cities.Just as in this movie, Ukraine itself is hauntingly pure and innocent, but also soiled and disturbed by its wish to set aside Communism and move forward -- but to a settled way of life that is not plagued by sentimentality.I fear I am too abstract in my description, but I am trying to set out the feelings and senses that are evoked in me by both this movie and Ukraine itself.  There are plenty of reviews that tell the story and the plot.  I want to add the senses and feelings that the movie urges in me. I suspect it will do the same for others curious enough to look. I can see in the movie a very original depiction of exactly what I saw and felt in the cities and countrysides of Ukraine. In this way, I learned how very thoroughly Western I am.The so called ""rigid tour"" in this movie reminds me vividly of the ride I took in a taxi (with a dozen people), crowded in a small van, from Kiev to Chernihiv.  It was the same worn down vehicle and yet the same sense of determination and acceptance. Along the way I could see weddings in the forest clearings, and I observed a coffin being taken to the rustic graveyard. This movie raises images that are etched in my mind from that experience.Quite aside from the story, which is both interesting and witty, the movie simply captures the entire essence of the place and the people.  The story is famous enough, and some describe the underlying book as a cult classic. For me, I have never read the book but I would also not want to. The emotional response I have to the movie itself is as much as I could ask.  I really would find it hard to become more involved in the story or the images.If you are curious about Ukraine and its people today, this is the movie to see - it is all there. Oh yes, in Kiev they are hip like Alex. Kiev was once the greatest capital of Europe, but that was 1200 years ago. For all its drive to be modern, Kiev is melancholy because it is a Holy place, where it is a center of Russian Orthodox faith, and where the stark realities of the Soviet era and the World War II devastation are clearly in evidence still.Again, I know I am streaming with emotion rather than attacking this with logic. But that is the place and this is the movie. The movie's great value is not in what it makes you think, but how it makes you feel.To me Alex is a prototypical Ukrainian young man. He is smart and he is sensitive and he wants to be somebody in the modern world.  He is a metaphor for Ukraine today.  Jonathan, the central character is the voyager in all of us.  The grandfather is the struggle in everyone's heart and the bittersweet taste of a life of love and resignation.It is all in the movie and that is the heart and soul of Ukraine. Keep plenty of Kleenex around. Yet you will be redeemed and the beauty and humor of it all will stay with you always.

She said she saw the DVD cover and thought that it looked right up my alley with its goggle-eyed Elijah Wood and the glaringly yellow background.  I couldn't tell her that I'd seen the flick sitting at the rental place for some time and always passed over it BECAUSE of the goggle-eyed Wood.  However, to my surprise this is one of the best films I've ever watched.It tells the tale of Jonathan Safran Foer's quest to find a woman who saved his grandfather from the Holocaust so many years ago.  Wood's character is very quirky, collecting odds and ends from different periods in his life in Ziploc bags and sticking them to a labeled wall full of family pictures.  He heads for the Ukraine and the almost mythical town of Odessa.  Once in the Ukraine, he meets up with his tour guide, Alex, a hip-hopping cool cat played with charm and perfect schtick by Eugene Hutz.  Along for the ride is Alex's grandfather and his grandfather's seeing-eye b*#$h, Sammy Davis, Jr., Jr.  Don't worry about the dog's weird name, it's hilariously explained in the film.As they make the trip to Odessa, first-time director Liev Schreiber creates and develops his tale with tender humor, moving flashbacks, and Hutz' goofy flair.  He uses wonderful visuals, vibrant and sublime colors, and key moments of silence to progress the story.I don't want to give away much more than the little bit I have.  Just know that Wood's character and his companions grow in heart and mind as the story rolls along.

Harris ""Film aficionado""","[4, 4]","I guess I'm a bit disappointed that most of the discussions on the merit of ""Everything Is Illuminated"" are based on it's comparisons to the novel.  I know we all do it, unintentionally or very specifically.  I'm as guilty as the next person--even though I know it's impossible to really compare the mediums.  It's particularly dangerous to adapt two types of books:  the huge mass market bestseller (say Grisham or Harry Potter) or a beloved literary cult novel with a small, but rabid, fan base like Foer's ""E is I"".  Ironically, the reason why is the same in both cases.  You have to leave things out, you have to make choices based on what is filmic and what isn't.That said, this film was sanctioned by Foer, who even has a small role in it.  And it's no big budget sell-out.  Foer turned his very personal novel over to Liev Schreiber.  It is clear from the start that Schreiber wants to honor the novel, honor its spirit, and turn it into a very personal film.I, for one, think that he has succeeded.  This is a minor gem that I think many people unfamiliar with ""Everything Is Illuminated"" (book or film) will discover and appreciate in time.  The film has much humor, an oddball sensibility, a real sense of time and place, great visuals, a certain sweetness, regret and sadness, and a message that isn't overstated.  I particularly enjoyed the subtle tone--nothing was played to overt dramatic effect.  While the beginning played largely as a comedy, the second half flowed more into a natural feeling of melancholy and nostalgia.  This wasn't played as a ""hit you over the head"" IMPORTANT MESSAGE MOVIE--which is largely it's appeal to me.And let me single out Eugene Hutz for a great, vastly enjoyable performance!

174072,A2NJO6YE954DBH,1419802356,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[4, 5]","""Everything Is Illuminated"" is a film where opposites halves become whole.  Jonathan Safran Foer (Elijah Wood) is a collector, and when his grandmother on her deathbed gives him a photograph of his late grandfather and a woman named Augustine he undertakes a quest back to the Ukraine to find out about this women and his family's past.  His guide in the Ukraine is also the film's narrator, Alex, Jr. (Eugene Hutz), a Ukrainian whose family runs ""Heritage Tours,"" where rich American Jews are driven around to find their dead ancestors.  Alex is into Michael Jackson and hip-hop music, and many women want to be carnal with him because of his dancing prowess (did I mention he speaks in your standard comical fractured English?).  Alex Sr. (Boris Leskin) drives the car, although he insists he is blind and treats his ""seeing eye bitch,"" a deranged dog found at a home for ""forgotten dogs"" and named Sammy Davis, Jr., Jr., better than his grandson.  As for Jonathan, well, he is a stranger in a strange land and he does not eat meat.The idea that the blind are leading the blind in this one is not far removed.  This odd quartet is in search of  Trachimbrod, a hamlet that it seems that nobody has ever heard of.  Jonathan's family is Jewish and his grandfather came to America on the eve of World War II from the Ukraine, so we know what nobody remembers hearing the name of this town.  The first half of this film indulges in the eccentricities of the characters and if you think this is some sort of screwball comedy where east meets west, you would not be far wrong.  But in this 2005 film it is not only that east meets west, but also one where the present collides with the past.  The film's title promises that everything will be revealed in the end, but that is hardly surprising since few films will refuse to divulge their secrets.There is a point in ""Everything Is Illuminated"" where things stop being funny.  How much you like this film will depend in large part on how accepting you are of this rather radical shift in tone and sentiment.  Certainly we are prepared for the inevitable discovery of the place where a thousand Ukrainian Jews were executed by the Nazis and the flashbacks specific to what happened to the characters.  Such tales are always sobering, and although we have heard countless tales of such horrors there is a sense in which the comic elements of the first half of the movie set up a qualitative shift to the grim stories of the past and the old woman (Laryssa Lauret) who awaits the traveler in a house surrounded by an endless sea of sunflowers.  But this turns out to be a film where such horrors are relating by telling rather than by seeing, which certainly proves to be effective, because the final flashback is reserved for something else for us to see to help complete the tale.Ironically, ""Everything Is Illuminated"" brings some lyrical aspects to its particular tale of the Holocaust because of Liev Schreiber's artistic sensibilities as a director.  Some might find the introduction of beauty into such scenes to be disconcerting, but I found them rather affirming.  Jonathan meets another ""collector,"" and comes to the realization that there is much more to life and to memory than putting things in Ziploc bags.  But in the end it is really the two Alexes, grandfather and grandson, who are on the larger journey of discovery, and they too are forced to realize that their little business is about larger things.  First time writer-director Schreiber has attempted something ambitious, but also tried to keep it on a more intimate and ultimately human level.  I think he succeeds more often than he fails in this effort, which is why I round up on this one (especially after seeing the deleted scenes on the DVD that graphically show how close he was to going too far and destroying the delicate balance on his finished film).",5,"Everything is illuminated in the light of the past, on the inside looking out",1143244800,"03 25, 2006",2006,3877,"['Everything', 'Illuminated', 'film', 'where', 'become', 'whole', 'Jonathan', 'Safran', 'Foer', 'Elijah', 'Wood', 'collector', 'when', 'grandmother', 'deathbed', 'photograph', 'late', 'grandfather', 'woman', 'named', 'Augustine', 'quest', 'back', 'Ukraine', 'find', 'out', 'women', 'family', 'past', 'guide', 'Ukraine', 'also', 'film', 'narrator', 'Alex', 'Jr.', 'Eugene', 'Hutz', 'Ukrainian', 'family', 'Heritage', 'Tours', 'where', 'rich', 'American', 'Jews', 'are', 'driven', 'find', 'dead', 'ancestors', 'Alex', 'Michael', 'Jackson', 'hip-hop', 'music', 'many', 'women', 'want', 'be', 'carnal', 'dancing', 'prowess', 'did', 'mention', 'standard', 'comical', 'fractured', 'English', 'Alex', 'Sr.', 'Boris', 'Leskin', 'car', 'blind', 'seeing', 'eye', 'bitch', 'deranged', 'dog', 'found', 'home', 'forgotten', 'dogs', 'named', 'Sammy', 'Davis', 'Jr.', 'Jr.', 'better', 'grandson', 'Jonathan', 'well', 'stranger', 'strange', 'land', 'not', 'eat', 'meat.The', 'idea', 'blind', 'are', 'leading', 'blind', 'one', 'not', 'far', 'removed', 'odd', 'quartet', 'search', 'Trachimbrod', 'hamlet', 'nobody', 'ever', 'heard', 'Jonathan', 'family', 'Jewish', 'grandfather', 'came', 'America', 'eve', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'Ukraine', 'know', 'what', 'nobody', 'hearing', 'name', 'town', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'eccentricities', 'characters', 'think', 'sort', 'screwball', 'comedy', 'where', 'east', 'meets', 'west', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'far', 'wrong', '2005', 'film', 'not', 'only', 'east', 'meets', 'west', 'also', 'one', 'where', 'present', 'collides', 'past', 'film', 'title', 'everything', 'will', 'be', 'revealed', 'end', 'hardly', 'surprising', 'few', 'films', 'will', 'refuse', 'divulge', 'secrets.There', 'point', 'Everything', 'Illuminated', 'where', 'things', 'stop', 'being', 'funny', 'How', 'much', 'film', 'will', 'depend', 'large', 'part', 'how', 'accepting', 'are', 'rather', 'radical', 'shift', 'tone', 'sentiment', 'Certainly', 'are', 'prepared', 'inevitable', 'discovery', 'place', 'where', 'thousand', 'Ukrainian', 'Jews', 'were', 'executed', 'Nazis', 'flashbacks', 'specific', 'what', 'happened', 'characters', 'Such', 'tales', 'are', 'always', 'sobering', 'have', 'heard', 'countless', 'tales', 'such', 'horrors', 'sense', 'comic', 'elements', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'set', 'up', 'qualitative', 'shift', 'grim', 'stories', 'past', 'old', 'woman', 'Laryssa', 'Lauret', 'who', 'traveler', 'house', 'surrounded', 'endless', 'sea', 'sunflowers', 'out', 'be', 'film', 'where', 'such', 'horrors', 'are', 'relating', 'telling', 'rather', 'seeing', 'certainly', 'be', 'effective', 'final', 'flashback', 'reserved', 'something', 'else', 'see', 'help', 'complete', 'tale.Ironically', 'Everything', 'Illuminated', 'lyrical', 'aspects', 'particular', 'tale', 'Holocaust', 'Liev', 'Schreiber', 'artistic', 'sensibilities', 'director', 'might', 'find', 'introduction', 'beauty', 'such', 'scenes', 'be', 'disconcerting', 'found', 'rather', 'affirming', 'Jonathan', 'collector', 'realization', 'much', 'more', 'life', 'memory', 'putting', 'things', 'Ziploc', 'bags', 'end', 'really', 'two', 'Alexes', 'grandfather', 'grandson', 'who', 'are', 'larger', 'journey', 'discovery', 'too', 'are', 'forced', 'realize', 'little', 'business', 'about', 'larger', 'things', 'First', 'time', 'writer-director', 'Schreiber', 'attempted', 'something', 'ambitious', 'also', 'tried', 'keep', 'more', 'intimate', 'ultimately', 'human', 'level', 'think', 'more', 'often', 'effort', 'why', 'round', 'up', 'one', 'especially', 'seeing', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'DVD', 'graphically', 'show', 'how', 'close', 'was', 'going', 'too', 'far', 'destroying', 'delicate', 'balance', 'finished', 'film']",N/A
174073,A1IWWRZJOXOSYP,1419802356,Lee Armstrong,"[9, 10]","Yes, ""Everything Is Illuminated"" is a strange film.  It is not the Hollywood blockbuster type.  Liev Schreiber in his first directing project does an excellent job.  The film is visually stunning, from the odd world of Jonathan who collects things in ziplock bags and tacks them to a wall to the Ukraine where Lista lives in the middle of a field of sunflowers.  The performances are first-rate.  As Jonathan, Elijah Wood's performance is minimalist, with his huge glasses being as much a part of his performance as his emotions.  His sadsack expressions seem heir to Buster Keaton such as the scene where he sits with a boiled potato that flies on the floor and gets fed to the dog.  Boris Leskin who was in ""Men In Black"" plays Grandfather, with true flare.  The story of a man who thinks he's blind and therefore wears thick sunglasses but who nevertheless drives the car is silly and endearing.  Eugene Hutz as the Ukrainian translator makes a big impression in the film.  His book-learned English is hilarious such as asking Jonathan, ""Do you participate in carnage with American women?""  Laryssa Lauret who plays the mysterious Jewish woman in the field of sunflowers turns in a stunningly beautiful performance.  Her eyes are soulful and filled with the depth of feeling of a lifetime.  One of the most touching moments comes as she asks if the war is over.  Sammy Davis Junior Junior, the dog, gives an excellent animal performance from the ferocious to the sympathetic.  The film is so individual in its look and story that it is immediately set apart from other films.  The issues of the Holocaust and loss make it emotionally universal in scope.  The fact that it is so well done makes it memorable.

174076,A3R4ZEDVRUWJNO,1419802356,Mark,"[5, 6]","Everything is Illuminated is essentially split into two parts: the comedy and the drama, and both are equally satisfying.  The first part contains a clash of cultures, and the development of some seriously interesting and oddball characters.  The narrator (Eugene Hutz) is Alex, Jonathan Safron Foer's (Elijah Wood) guide through the Ukraine to find Augustina, a woman who had saved Foer's grandfather from Nazi's.  Foer's character is extremely eccentric, collecting everything from false teeth to pictures to dirt (he is reffered a few times as ""The Collecter"").  He travels to Ukraine and enlists the help of a company that helps people find some element of their past in Ukraine.  From the moment we meet Alex and his wildly vulgar grandfather (who has a big part in the second half), we know that these characters are one of a kind.  Alex picks Jonathan up at a train station, and from then on, Jonathan is known to Alex as JonFan.  ""My name is Jonathan.""  ""Yes, JonFan.""  Alex is extremely odd.  He aspires to be the equivalent of an American ""Player"" and he dresses in everything hip-hop.  The grandfather is also very odd.  He believes himself to be blind, even though that is not the case, and he travels with a female dog, Sammy Davis Jr. Jr., or as she is known, his ""seeing eye b*tch.""  There odyssey across Ukraine takes them to remote locations, but it isn't so much the trip that is interesting, as the clash of cultures.  There are a few instances where they don't quite understand each other.  For instance, they stop at a crude restaurant to eat, and Foer explains that he is a vegetarian, and that he doesn't eat meat.  No one in the entire room knows why, and the grandfather, as well as the owner of the establishment, asks ""What is wrong with him?""  The language barrier is also an issue, and counts for many laughs during their journey.  Alex often uses odd ways of phrasing things, like ""Did you catch some repose"" for ""Did you sleep"" and ""Do you participate in carnage with American women"" instead of ""Do you have sex.""

174078,A2R6RA8FRBS608,1419802356,Matthew G. Sherwin,"[0, 0]","Everything Is Illuminated tells the highly interesting story of a young Jewish man, Jonathan Safran Foer (played well by Elijah Wood), who travels to Ukraine from America to find the woman who rescued his grandfather during World War II. The acting is rather convincing and the plot moves along at a good pace; I was never once bored and I enjoyed the humor which comes mostly at the beginning of the film. The cinematography is excellent and they did a fairly good job, although not a perfect one, of adapting the real life Jonathan Foer's book into a movie.When the action starts, Jonathan, who loves to collect things so he won't forget his past, comes to Ukraine and meets his ""guides,"" a rather crabby old man (Boris Leskin) and his grandson Alex (played brilliantly by Eugene Hutz). Boris and Alex also have with them the grandfather's ""seeing eye b*tch;"" the grandfather claims he is blind but of course he's really not sight impaired at all.It isn't long before they start heir journey to the small village named Trachimbrod where Jonathan's grandfather was rescued by Augustine, the villager Jonathan hopes very much to find. They get lost along the way and get hit up by a small kid demanding chewing gum before he'll clear the way for the car; and the scenes in which Jonathan has to sit in the rear of the car with a dog he's afraid of are very funny indeed. I also agree with the reviewer who writes that as time goes along Jonathan and Alex's two personalities balance each other out very well and in some sense Alex does become an older brother for Jonathan.Eventually they get started in the right direction after all. Of course, questions arise. Will Trachimbrod be built up again after the Germans wiped it off the map during the war? Will they find Augustine and be able to thank her; or will they find a relative of Augustine's instead? What happens when a very deep secret of the grandfather's is finally revealed toward the end of the film? No plot spoilers here, folks--watch the movie and find out!The DVD has a few extras but not as many as I would have liked. The film's soundtrack has some pretty good musical numbers by Gogol Bordello.Overall, Everything Is Illuminated is an outstanding motion picture that I highly recommend. It will have special significance for the Jewish community and persons studying the era of World War II.

Music montages - fast forward.  Mindless action - fast forward. It takes me awhile before I trust a movie enough to put the remote down.  I put the remote down during this film.  This film is clever.  Visually stunning.  Musically hilarious.  Uncomfortably funny.This movie is about a young man who collects things - any thing in relation to his family and his travels.  He keeps the things in clear ziploc bags so they are easy to sort and see.  He travels far away in search of a ""city"" connected to his family's past, a city that every local person either is unaware of or pretends to know nothing about.The young man is named Jonathan.  He is driven around in search of the old city by a translator his age, named Alex, and an old man driver.  Alex asks Jonathan why he collects, ""Why do you do this?""  Jonathan replies, ""I guess sometimes I'm afraid I'll forget.""  ""In case anyone comes searching.""Jonathan collects things that most other people discard.  Like the boy Salvatore in the movie Cinema Paradiso, who collects all the ""good parts"" of movies that others find valueless or perverse, Jonathan treasures keeping hold of items from his past with emotional significance.They meet an old woman who knew Jonathan's ancestors.  She too is a collector of things from the lost parts of her past.  But she keeps things in opaque and labeled boxes, possibly because they would be too much and too painful to look at all the time.  We know Jonathan looks just like his grandfather from an old picture Jonathan has of his grandfather when he was his age.  The old woman must take off Jonathan's glasses to identify him.  She has to remove his perspective to see the accurate dimensions of his eyes.  The old woman takes him to the ""city"" that no longer exists and tells them of how it was destroyed.  She tells him how the Nazis forced every man in the village to spit on all their books of learning and sacred texts.  They forced the villagers at gun point to deny any points of authority in contradiction to their own.  If you weren't with them, then you were against them - the Nazi's rationale.  The Germans believed it was best to have only one true authority and non-Aryan ideas should be silenced forever.I recommend this movie for reasons beyond what I fully understand.

Having read some of the other reviews I gather that much of the book was left out, which was disappointing to many.  I think I'd like to read it now, especially to clear up some of the action in the last part.However, taking the film on its own I found it to be very enjoyable.The one weak point for me was the ""star"" Elijah Wood, whose bespectacled face appears on the cover.  As the hero and protagonist, he leaves a lot to be desired.  It's probably not the actor's fault. He was dressed in a black suit at all times (would any kid from the US travelling through Europe  and sometimes sleeping outside wear a suit?) and forced to wear inch thick round glasses and told never to show any emotion. He walks so stiffly that, at one point I thought he was imitating Charlie Chaplin. He collects things, all kinds of things, including his grandmother's false teeth, which he places in ziploc bags and hangs on his wall.  Worst is his lack of emotional affect, which doesn't seem to melt even in the very dramatic final scenes. I found his personality, or lack of it, bordering on the pathological and the story fails to explain it.  The result, for me, was that I failed to connect with him at all.However, more than making up for this was the character of the Ukrainian tour guide, magnificently played by Eugene Hutz, a first time actor, and front man for a Ukranian pop-folk-gypsy band.  He plays the flashy, swaggering, hip-hop loving, city guy, who wears gold chains with his running suit. He has a terrific face and a gold tooth.  His hilarious translations are the source of much of the humor in the first part of the film.  And, as the plot darkens, he plays the subtle and deep notes equally as well as the funny ones.  He is a treasure and makes the film worth watching.Boris Leskin plays his grandfather and he is wonderful to watch, too, as he changes from a bitter old man who pretends to  be blind into someone whose small black eyes sparkle  with love in the final scenes. There's also a great dog.Equally interesting is the trip through the Ukrainian countryside.  The photography is lovely, at times stunning.  The scene of the fairytale cottage in the midst of a field of sunflowers is almost magical, as is the beautiful old woman who inhabits the cottage.I could quibble with the handling of the final part of the film.  It's a bit muddled and the emotions are perhaps dragged out too much.But apparently Liev Shreiber had deep feelings for the story as it paralleled much of his own family history, so he can be excused.I think that he did a very good job directing his first film.

It is true that Ukraine is a free state today in name at least and the past is there to be sifted through, a battlefield of bloody artifacts.  The Lives of Other's, a recent Foreign Film Academy winner does a nice job on Leftist Fascism, the ruined lives of a police state; however, EII takes a more curious, mystical path to relatives lost not all that long ago.Elijah Woods plays a young Jewish man from New York that is obsessed with his dead grandfather's roots. Those roots include an escape from death at the hands of the SS in 1941. The old man's village had been rounded up and assassinated, all 1000 residents, thereby obliterating the citizens and their way of life.  These scenes are handled with restraint considering, but especially the first half of the film proceeds as a quirky comedy of errors showing the bizarre misunderstandings between perceptions of American Culture and their adulation in modern Ukraine. The Ukrainian hipster, Eugene Lutz, is tortured by his crazy family and amazed at the very unhip American he must guide back to the past.Woods' character is almost as an autistic mental patient with a deadpan face that shows emotion rarely which at first is amusing and then when the film becomes serious, it is maddening.

Certainly, there's a problem with great books being put to film; that author Jonathan Safran Foer helped in the production and screenplay, I can find no problem inasmuch as the necessary moments are well represented. As directed by Liev Schreiber, with obvious care and compassion, I enjoyed the road-movie narrative at all times. The inclusion of Eugene Hutz created a much needed bit of lightness in the proceedings. Other reviewers thought it was a Borat rip-off, but Borat came 2 years later. Someone even cried racism, but there were equal punches from Americans, Ukranians and Jews alike. No problem there. The fact that Mr. Foer himself aided in writing this film makes me think that Hutz' performance was not a carricature at all. What bothered me was that Foer's character, as portrayed by the usually terrific Elijah Wood, was totally insensitive, like an observer in his own story. Totally lacking in any emotional vibe; he hugged the dog at the end, which was his only show of affection at all. And a great dog performance, too. Boris Leskin is excellent, too, as the faux-blind driver, who has his own catharsis. I think it's Jana Hrabetova who plays the real hero of the film, at the end, so sensitive and endearing. My resulting opinion is that Mr. Schreiber made a quality Indie film about an often ignored situation, based on a big book, and done well.

In ""Everything is Illuminated"" while things seem to be going in different directions, they all end up at one place in space, and several places in time. On the surface, the movie is about one man who is trying to piece together a moment in his family's past, another man who knows nothing about his family's past (but will find out), and a third man who knew about his past, deliberately blinded himself to it, only to discover it again in a more ""illuminated "" way.But there is so much more to it than this.

It has a story, it has humor, and it has heart, but it never becomes pretentious. The film follows Jonathan (Elijah Wood), a ""collector"" of memories. He is attempting to retrace his grandfather's life and learn about the woman that saved him from WWII. He journeys to the Ukrane where his tour guides consist of a hip-hop obsessed translator Alex (Eugene Hutz) and his eccentric grandfather (Boris Leskin). They rib him for being afraid of their dog, Sammy Davis Jr. Jr., and for being a vegetarian. They want to know why he wants to learn about his grandfather. Along the way, however, his strangeness becomes comfortable and everyone realizes they have much more in common than initially realized.The comedy is intellectual, just like in Little Miss Sunshine.

He travels from America, where he lives, joins up with a translator, the translator's grandfather who is also their driver, and the translator's grandfather's dog.All he has to go on is an old photograph of his grandfather and the young woman who helped him leave for America. Will he find the village where his grandfather came from? Why is the grandfather acting so mysterious? And who is the mysterious Augustine?I'm not even sure of the answer to these questions, even though I've seen it. I didn't really understand what they were looking for, or why it was so hard to find. And I didn't understand the ending either. I think I was just missing something.  To be honest, I wasn't sure if this was supposed to be a comedy, a drama, or something else. It didn't really have enough suspense to make it work as a mystery, and it wasn't really funny enough to be a comedy I thought. Perhaps a few more twists in the plot would have helped, or more jokes. I also found the soundtrack off-putting and annoying at times.On the other hand, my girlfriend liked it a lot. Apparently it's based on a book, though she said the film only covers half of the book, which she says is much better because you get a better idea of the history of the place he's looking for.

It looked basically average based on the DVD back cover, and I figured it wasn't really worth my time to watch. WOW, WAS I WRONG. What a pleasant surprise this movie turned out to be. Excellent writing, excellent character development, excellent direction, quirky without excess, many funny moments, sparkling dialogue- This is a great movie!I never read the novel, so I can tell you that it isn't required to understand or appreciate the film. While I'm sure the book gets far more in-depth with the concepts of the story, the film stands by itself as a work of art, and delivers a multi-layered story that is both funny and powerful. Great stuff.Elijah Woood's performance is fine, but the film really belongs to Eugene Hutz. What a tour-de-force from this basically unknown actor! In addition, the grandfather role is performed deftly by Boris Lefkin, thus rounding out a top-notch group of actors. First-time director Liev Schreiber proves he will be a force to reckon with, as his pacing and direction sparkle.While I don't want to give away the story, as I believe not knowing too much about this film adds immeasurably to its enjoyment, it is a pretty basic ""getting in touch with your past"" story, with numerous original and excellent touches added.

He is more like a window through which we see a long history of some people he is going to meet, and those people should be called the real protagonists of the story.A young Jewish American man Jonathan (Wood) travels to Ukraine to find out the truths behind his grandfather's escape from the Nazi holocaust. He hires two local Ukrainians Alex (musician-turned-actor Eugene Hutz, who is very good) and Alex's grandfather (Boris Leskin) and dog called Sammy Davis Jr. Jr. (yes, double Jrs). The first part of the film follows their long journey by an old Trabant car, and often very funny with the quirky (and amusing) dialogues between Alex as translator and slightly nerdy Jonathan.First-time director Liev Schreiber, it seems, always insists on giving some quirky touch to the film's beautifully shot scenes and it works to some extent when the film changes its tone in the second part where the truths about Jonathan's grandfather are revealed. Look how he managed to show an old lady's house surrounded by sunflowers and you will realize Liev Schreiber gets the story's fable-like quality right.But two things I didn't like about the film and one of them is the jumbled and confusing flashbacks that play a significant role in the history of these people. The story about their past is too short and looks emotionally detached. Quirky humor certainly helps make the film less sentimental in the modern part of the story, but to present the past the film needs another kind of narrative skills to draw us into its world.The other complaint is that something is missing which might have been lost during the translating process from the book to the screen. You will notice many quirky traits in characters such as Jonathan's habit of collecting family artifacts, Alex's grandfather's denial of his seeing things, etc. What do they mean? You will think, and even reflect after watching the film, but they look almost pointless compared with the brief but touching moments involving the character played by Laryssa Lauret, who recounts her story with pain and grief. I know some films need to be interpreted by us (or I must read the book in the first place), but at the same time films can be confident with the director's own interpretation or vision as to the book's contents. I frankly didn't know how I should watch this film. Comedy? Drama? Road Movie? Or Everything?Perhaps I didn't find the film as impressive as other reviewers because, for all its strangely funny and engaging moments, what happens (and happened) is absolutely different.

174115,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,1419802356,Turfseer,"[2, 5]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***'Everything is Illuminated"" is a story based on a novel by Jonathan Safran Foer who made a trip to Ukraine in 1999 to research his family history. His experiences form the basis for the novel and the subsequent screenplay, mainly penned by the film's director, well-known actor, Liev Schreiber. In the novel, Jonathan is a writer but Schreiber turns him into a very quirky caricature who is obsessed with collecting things related to his family (the 'heirlooms'--and I'm being very generous in using that word to describe what Jonathan collects--are basically anything that this oddball deems interesting). He places everything he collects in plastic baggies and then pins them on his wall at home (by the way, we never find out what this guy does for a living or if he has any friends).The inciting incident involves Jonathan's grandmother (who while on her deathbed) gives her grandson a picture of his grandfather standing next to a mysterious woman named Augustine. The picture is dated 1940 and was taken in an unknown town in Ukraine. It seems that Jonathan's grandfather managed to escape to the United States right before the Holocaust with the hope that he might be able to arrange for his pregnant first wife (the woman in the picture, Augustine) to soon follow him. Schreiber tells us that Jonathan's grandfather left a week before Augustine is murdered by the Nazis. It would seem extremely unlikely that he would have a) left his wife and/or b) successfully made it to the United States given that the vast majority of Jews had no means of leaving Ukraine and escaping the Nazis, especially with one week before the invasion and subsequent occupation.The break into the second act of the story occurs when Jonathan arrives in Ukraine and meets Alex, his genial tour guide whose command of the English language serves as the butt of many jokes throughout the film. Schrieber informs us that the grandfather, who acts as the driver, began the business back in the 50s, taking rich Jews around so that they can research their family history. Unfortunately, Schreiber gets his facts wrong since such tours would never have been permitted back then since Ukraine was a satellite of the Soviet Union (nor did Jews make pilgrimages to Ukraine to research their family history at that point in time) Much of the film's humor falls flat, especially in regards to Alex's linguistic gaffes. ""The seeing eye bitch"" (which refers to the 'demented' family dog) is one line which seems to be repeated too many times. Other malapropisms include Alex's reference to his brother as ""miniature' instead of ""younger"" and the 'rigid search' for Jonathan's roots in place of 'comprehensive'. Instead of 'sleep', Alex manages to substitute the more difficult 'repose', which may be the screenwriter's way of suggesting that the character is trying to sound smarter than he is.Certainly the Ukrainians don't come off very well in this film. Schreiber (or perhaps Foer also--I haven't read the book) harp on the Ukrainians' shock at the fact that Jonathan is a vegetarian--they simply can't imagine anyone not eating meat. More damaging is Schreiber's observation that the Ukrainian family (represented by Alex and his father and grandfather) are inherently violent. Alex's father is seen slugging him at the beginning of the film--and later the grandfather attacks Alex after Alex attacks the family dog. The attempt here is to view Jonathan's hosts as affectionate--but more often than not, they come off as surly and unsympathetic.After all the failed attempts at comedy, the last quarter of the film changes gears and we're asked to take the goofy Jonathan and Alex much more seriously. They discover Augustine's elderly sister, Lista, living off the beaten track in a house hidden by a grove of perfectly kept sunflowers (while the impractical Lista has never been in a car in her entire life, one wonders how she keeps her sunflowers so perfectly arranged). It's Lista who reveals that Augustine was married to Jonathan's grandfather and was murdered by the Nazis along with her father, who refused to spit on the Torah as ordered by his executioners. One wonders how Lista herself escaped as she is clearly Jewish (she too is a 'collector' like Jonathan, saving the buried artifacts of the once thriving Jewish community she used to be part of).Lista ends up having a 'private' conversation with Alex's grandfather which triggers his repressed memories: it turns out the grandfather actually was Jewish himself and was left for dead after facing a Nazi firing squad. In the book, the grandfather is a non-Jew who must save his own family by turning in Jews; Schreiber creates a more unlikely portrait of the grandfather, a guilt-ridden Jew, who ends up committing suicide. I just couldn't buy how this irascible older codger would suddenly feel pangs of guilt (after such a long period of time) and do himself in.Finally I'm told that the memorial for the Jews that Jonathan, Alex and his grandfather discover in the empty field is not something that is likely to be found in Western Ukraine. As one Ukrainian Jewish poster has pointed out, there are more monuments to the murderers to be found there than monuments to victims of the Holocaust.While it's certainly admirable that Schreiber has done a service in once again reminding film-goers of the horrors of the Holocaust, implausibly turning Alex and his family into observant Jews after a lifetime of regarding Jewish people with suspicion, seems to be a pointless exercise in wish fulfillment. One is further disappointed with Schreiber's portrait of his detached protagonist--the quirky Jonathan--who never is believable as a real person and has no real moments of growth. In the end, the 'culture clash' between Ukrainian/Russian and Western sensibilities is decidedly weighted against the Ukrainians and the Holocaust is 'illuminated' through the unlikely suicide of one of its victims.",2,Conflicting tales of light weight culture clash and Holocaust Survivor guilt fail to mesh,1268784000,"03 17, 2010",2010,5981,"['***', 'review', 'may', 'contain', 'spoilers',

174123,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,1419802356,Z Hayes,"[1, 1]","I've yet to read the book (of the same title) by Jonathan Safran Foer, but I found this movie adaptation directed by Liev Schreiber (who has been in several Holocaust-themed dramas, such as ""Jakob the Liar"" and most recently ""Defiance"") to be engrossing and entertaining with a blend of both the comic and tragic. This is quite impressive considering the movie marks Schreiber's directorial debut.The story centers around a young Jewish man, Jonathan Safran Foer (played by Elijah Wood) who has a penchant for collecting things in little ziploc bags, ranging from the ordinary to the truly bizarre(his grandmother's dentures). This obsessive collecting is due to his fear of forgetting the past, and when his dying grandmother passes him two keepsakes that belonged to his deceased grandfather, Jonathan decides to travel to Odessa, Ukraine in an attempt to discover his grandfather's past. One of these keepsakes is a picture with his grandfather Safran and a young woman who apparently saved Safran from the Nazis during WW II. To aid him on his quest, Jonathan hires two guides, Alexander Perchov (Eugene Hutz in a brilliant performance) who is obsessed with Michael Jackson, and his grouchy and anti-Semitic grandfather (Boris Laskin who also delivers a powerful performance). Grandpa has a psychotic dog named Sammy Davis Jr. Jr. (go figure) and the trio proceed on their journey - destination is Trachimbrod, which used to be a Jewish shtetl.Most of the movie focuses on the road trip and is quite hilarious, especially in watching the dynamics of three very different people travelling together. Grandpa's virulent anti-Semitism is softened by Alex's creative translation efforts (since Grandpa only speaks Ukrainian, Jonathan relies on Alex to translate for him). I could not help but laugh out loud at Alex's overzealous attempts at speaking English - ""Do you repose?"" he asks Jonathan, eliciting a sort of ""huh"" response until Jonathan figures out he means ""sleeping""! The last third of the movie focuses on what happens to the trip after they finally find a home in the countryside where an old woman (Laryssa Lauret) helps Jonathan find some closure. There are also some interesting twists in the story at this point, with some startling revelations.I found this a refreshing Holocaust-themed drama. The Holocaust by its very subject matter is hard to depict on screen without resorting to the usual depictions of stomach-churning brutality (as evidenced by dramas like ""Schindler's List"", ""The Grey Zone"", ""War and Remembrance"", and ""Holocaust"", amongst others). In ""Everything Is Illuminated"" there is a balance between the tragic and the comic, and even the flashbacks to the past involving violence is subtly done. The focal point here is not so much the horrors of the Holocaust but of people searching for closure and making peace with events of the past. The strong cast makes this an above-average film, delivering credible and compelling performances. The cinematography is gorgeous, capturing the lush beauty of the countryside. The DVD itself contains no bonus worth mentioning (just some deleted scenes and a trailer).
