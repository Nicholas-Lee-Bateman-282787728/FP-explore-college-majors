Hughley, and it was actually in 2008 when his comedy finally caught on with me. I had flown out to California for the first time in order to drive back a car I had purchased since the now defunct dealership could not obtain cheaper shipping transport for my car. Between the jet lag, adrenaline, and the time zone change, which I had never experienced, I was so worn down by the time I was picked up from the airport. After officially taking possession of the car, I slept under a big tent at the dealership for 2 hours with the guys at the dealership keeping watch over me. When I found a room, I could not sleep because the time there was 6pm, but my body was operating on east coast time, 9pm. So I found that Redondo Beach was 1 mile away and I got to see the Pacific Ocean. When I got back, I still did not sleep well and found myself awake at 3am and HBO was about to play Unapologetic. I laughed myself silly, and I have followed him ever since. Reset continues the in-your-face style that he has done for a long time, but his comedy, to me, has improved dramatically since Kings of Comedy. The title is a line he repeats periodically throughout this session, it's the one line my wife loves to repeat. As usual, at the end, he humors myself by finding members of the audience to spill on, but he is not mean about it, but definitely funny. He is not the one to play the dozens with.
