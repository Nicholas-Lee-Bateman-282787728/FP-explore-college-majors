1337074,ASPFKVEK93L0L,B003D7D07W,Angelus Draven,"[1, 11]","I rented this movie because it had good ratings here on Amazon. It was my mistake not to read some of the reviews before putting this in. Both my wife and I watched this last night and thought it was a waste of time and money. We watched it all the way through since we had already paid for it(Netflix). I don't mind movies where there's a lot of talking(my wife complains about too much talking in movies), but this movie we both agreed that it was horrible.If I had known it was about Australian incest, i would not think twice to rent it. The only people that I see rating this high are people who are turned on by this sort of subject. It's a very touchy subject and weird, but I guess it happens. If incest had been a minor theme and there was more to the story, it would have been better. The thing is that the plot is surrounded and revolves around the subject of incest, which if you're normal, should gross you out. Considering the material, the actors and director did great with what was given to them. I gave it a rating of '1' to balance out the overall rating.",1,Would not have rented if I had known...,1298678400,"02 26, 2011",2011,1074,"['rented', 'movie', 'had', 'good', 'ratings', 'here', 'Amazon', 'was', 'mistake', 'not', 'read', 'reviews', 'putting', 'wife', 'watched', 'last', 'night', 'thought', 'was', 'waste', 'time', 'money', 'watched', 'way', 'had', 'already', 'paid', 'Netflix', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'movies', 'where', 'lot', 'talking', 'wife', 'too', 'much', 'talking', 'movies', 'movie', 'agreed', 'was', 'horrible.If', 'had', 'known', 'was', 'about', 'Australian', 'incest', 'i', 'would', 'not', 'think', 'twice', 'rent', 'only', 'people', 'see', 'rating', 'high', 'are', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'turned', 'sort', 'subject', 'very', 'touchy', 'subject', 'weird', 'guess', 'incest', 'had', 'been', 'minor', 'theme', 'was', 'more', 'story', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'thing', 'plot', 'surrounded', 'around', 'subject', 'incest', ""'re"", 'normal', 'should', 'gross', 'out', 'Considering', 'material', 'actors', 'director', 'did', 'great', 'what', 'was', 'given', 'gave', 'rating', '1', 'balance', 'out', 'overall', 'rating']",N/A

Her husband, Bryan Brown, was cast as the father in the film, which I'm sure helped attract funding.The film needs to be seen without spoilers, so I'll just comment on my overall assessment of the film.  It is set in South Australia, which apparently is dry and desolate (though some of that may be due to a seven-year drought).  Father Bruce Kendall is a tough taskmaster who has charge of four children; Ned, who in the film returns after a 20-year absence to see his father as he is dying, Sally, who has remained behind on the farm, and works with disadvantaged youth, Cliff, who is perhaps an under-achiever, and the titular Beautiful Kate.Bruce has suffered a number of losses, his wife, and two of his children.  After all of these years, he still doesn't understand what happened to cause the death of the two.  There's the official story, but he suspects more.  Will he learn the full story before he dies?We see the dysfunction of the family after Ned arrives with his trampy girlfriend, Toni.  Toni is a waitress, but claims to be an actress, one who doesn't need clothes, according to Ned.  The bickering starts right up as if the past 20 years hadn't happened.  The children never call Bruce 'Dad'; he's always just Bruce.Slowly, the secrets unravel, though a combination of present day footage and flashbacks.  Both are arranged to slowly let the audience in on what has transpired so many years ago that left a family torn apart.Recommended.  This film is another worthy effort by the Australian film industry.  The landscape, harsh, dry and rugged as it is, gives the film some of its power.  Living in a remote area may have propelled the events that otherwise would not have happened.",4,Another Solid Film from Down Under,1310688000,"07 15, 2011",2011,1853,"['Beautiful', 'Kate', 'apparently', 'was', 'idea', 'director', 'Rachel', 'Ward', 'mind', 'time', 'could', 'get', 'first', 'feature', 'film', 'ground', 'husband', 'Bryan', 'Brown', 'was', 'cast', 'father', 'film', ""'m"", 'sure', 'helped', 'attract', 'funding.The', 'film', 'needs', 'be', 'seen', 'spoilers', ""'ll"", 'just', 'comment', 'overall', 'assessment', 'film', 'set', 'South', 'Australia', 'apparently', 'dry', 'desolate', 'may', 'be', 'due', 'seven-year', 'drought', 'Father', 'Bruce', 'Kendall', 'tough', 'taskmaster', 'who', 'charge', 'four', 'children', 'Ned', 'who', 'film', 'returns', '20-year', 'absence', 'see', 'father', 'dying', 'Sally', 'who', 'remained', 'farm', 'disadvantaged', 'youth', 'Cliff', 'who', 'perhaps', 'under-achiever', 'titular', 'Beautiful', 'Kate.Bruce', 'suffered', 'number', 'losses', 'wife', 'two', 'children', 'years', 'still', ""n't"", 'understand', 'what', 'happened', 'cause', 'death', 'two', 'official', 'story', 'more', 'Will', 'learn', 'full', 'story', 'see', 'dysfunction', 'family', 'Ned', 'trampy', 'girlfriend', 'Toni', 'Toni', 'waitress', 'claims', 'be', 'actress', 'one', 'who', ""n't"", 'need', 'clothes', 'according', 'Ned', 'bickering', 'right', 'up', 'past', '20', 'years', 'had', ""n't"", 'happened', 'children', 'never', 'call', 'Bruce', ""'Dad"", 'always', 'just', 'Bruce.Slowly', 'secrets', 'unravel', 'combination', 'present', 'day', 'footage', 'flashbacks', 'are', 'arranged', 'slowly', 'let', 'audience', 'transpired', 'so', 'many', 'years', 'left', 'family', 'torn', 'apart.Recommended', 'film', 'worthy', 'effort', 'Australian', 'film', 'industry', 'landscape', 'harsh', 'dry', 'rugged', 'film', 'power', 'Living', 'remote', 'area', 'may', 'have', 'propelled', 'events', 'otherwise', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'happened']",N/A
