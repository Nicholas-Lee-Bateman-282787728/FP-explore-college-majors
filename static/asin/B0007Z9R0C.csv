He really took a liking to it, and he started repeating phrases and acting out the story in the video. It really impressed his speech therapist (my son is hearing impaired). She said he really used what hearing he had to hear and understand it, because you can't read the lips of animation.It blessed me to see him trying to say more words by memorizing such an educational video. He even sings the songs! He LOVES rocket, and he spins around and signs the word ""airplane"" with both hands as he runs around.This series really reinforces and sparks imaginative play and helped my son a lot! I highly recommend this video, as well as the others.

Not like alot of Disney's other banal TV productions, this show really has merits.I mean how can you not like a show that has your children yelling staccato and legato, adagio and allegro. And knowing what these terms mean!Children are taught that music has `layers' and that the musical `themes' can be representative of a particular character or action.  For example, a crescendo may help the sun rise, or a wave get bigger.In addition, children are introduced to fine art, architecture, and landmarks from around the world.  Examples (not necessarily from this video) include works from Gaughan, Monet, the Seattle Space Needle, the Great Sphynx, Antartica, the Great Wall of China....Five Stars.  A wonderful introduction to fine art and classical music that 'sticks' with young children.

My daughter was never a huge Baby Einstein fan, but I thought we'd try one more video before ruling it out. The content of the video is not very entertaining. My daughter lost interest in it within the first few minutes of it starting. The music is good, which did hold her attention when the songs were playing. Beyond that, she barely paid attention to the screen the rest of the time. If you and your kids like Baby Einstein, give the video a try. If you're on the fence about Baby Einstein, I'd advise you to buy a different video.
