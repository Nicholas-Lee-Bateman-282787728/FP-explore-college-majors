He's a master, no doubt, but what brought me to tears wasn't the 'near death scene' at his suicide attempt, but his stirring speech before the disciplinary committee.  THIS type of speeches make history!  All the other stuff may or may not happen--the facts would vary, of course, but the strength of the movie are the underlying principles that make life worth living.  Not being melodramatic, just a tad bit jealous that a person put them into words so well, and that another person internalized them so masterfully as to make them sound...infallible...despite, or against all else.GREAT show.  Not the action flicks I'm used to, but nonetheless satisfying on a deeper philosophical level.

44619,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,0783204914,Andrew Ellington,"[4, 9]","As a whole, `Scent of a Woman' is rather endearing and it possesses a level of charm I really didn't expect.  On the other hand, there are parts of this film that are genuinely terrible.  It's hard to decide my concrete feelings because the film is wildly uneven.  The entire closing segment (or really anything pertaining to the `troubles at school') is an eye-rolling waste of celluloid, and yet the majority of the antics in New York City (especially that beloved tango scene) are fun and witty and enchanting to tell you the truth.  It's just that the film loses itself in a sloppy closing (yes, it's terrible in more than one way) that betrays some of the honesty (if you can call it that) that the film was reaching for.I'll yell SPOILERS, just in case.The film revolves around a retired Lieutenant Colonel named Frank Slade.  Frank is a bitter, blind alcoholic who resents his life and his family.  He is living in a guest house behind his niece's home since Veteran housing was not to his liking.  He has burnt many bridges in his family, and his prickly demeanor makes it difficult for him to interact with others.  In walks Charlie, a young prep school student looking for some extra cash in order to afford a plane ticket home for Christmas.  He answers an ad to basically babysit Slade for Thanksgiving weekend so that his niece and her family can go on vacation.  Little does Charlie know, but Slade has other plans.  Shortly after his niece is gone, a taxi arrives taking both Slade and Charlie to the airport.  They are going on a little trip to New York City, where Slade plans on reuniting with his brother, eating at a fine restaurant, making love to a beautiful woman and then killing himself.  Charlie isn't really keen on the whole idea, but the last part especially concerns him.  Frank is very persuasive though (or should I say `aggressive') and so Charlie bends to his wishes.For the most part, the film excels while in New York City.  The relationship that blossoms between both Frank and Charlie is sweet and sincere.  The fears that corrode Frank's demeanor are believable; I just wish that they were addressed a little more authentically (his sudden shift at the close of their trip is a little too abrupt for it to feel honest).  Sure, some parts can seem a tad hokey (like the Ferrari scene) but they work in the atmosphere created for the film.  It's just that the entire `school' subplot is so ridiculous that it drags the entire film into an area it didn't need to go.  The closing `hearing' itself was kind of disgusting, and Pacino's monologue is overdone and the reaction afterwards was unintentionally hilarious.  The site reviewer was correct when he made the connection to `The Dead Poets Society' (another film that makes me roll my eyes).  I was just waiting for the students to hoist Frank and Charlie on their shoulders and carry them out of the auditorium.And then there is Pacino.  I hate what he's been reduced to.  He basically plays a caricature of his own persona in every film.  I will say this; I totally understand why he won the Oscar for this.  First of all, he is ridiculously convincing at playing blind.  Second, he has all the right `scenes' to win an Oscar (he tries to kill himself, he insults everyone around him, he gets drunk, he saves the day...HE YELLS).  Third, he was overdue by a large margin.  But, with all that said, if we are basing this on the merit of the performance alone; he was far too uneven here.  In fact, the only scene that really felt genuine and just perfect was that tango scene.  He was marvelous there, but Pacino often reverted to his overacting and yelling and overselling everything to the point where he felt phony.  I understand the whole `character' thing, but there is such a thing as subtlety, and there were so many opportunities to use subtlety to convey a deeper emotion in Frank (especially when he's breaking down about his life).  A scene that really works thanks to some subtlety on Pacino's part is the scene at his brother's home.  I just wish that he had expounded on that side of Frank a little more.He's not bad, but Eastwood, Rae, Downey Jr. and especially Washington were all better than him.At the end of the day, I liked this movie.  I'd watch it again.  I'd even recommend it.  But, the film is not great, and it barely makes `good' when you look at it as a whole.  If you can delete the last twenty minutes from your mind you may have a really good buddy flick.",3,Take a big whiff...,1315785600,"09 12, 2011",2011,4476,"['whole', 'Scent', 'Woman', 'rather', 'endearing', 'level', 'charm', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'other', 'hand', 'are', 'parts', 'film', 'are', 'genuinely', 'terrible', 'hard', 'decide', 'concrete', 'feelings', 'film', 'wildly', 'uneven', 'entire', 'closing', 'segment', 'really', 'anything', 'pertaining', 'troubles', 'school', 'eye-rolling', 'waste', 'celluloid', 'yet', 'majority', 'antics', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'especially', 'beloved', 'tango', 'scene', 'are', 'fun', 'witty', 'enchanting', 'tell', 'truth', 'just', 'film', 'sloppy', 'closing', 'yes', 'terrible', 'more', 'one', 'way', 'honesty', 'can', 'call', 'film', 'was', 'reaching', 'for.I', ""'ll"", 'yell', 'SPOILERS', 'just', 'case.The', 'film', 'around', 'retired', 'Lieutenant', 'Colonel', 'named', 'Frank', 'Slade', 'Frank', 'bitter', 'blind', 'alcoholic', 'who', 'life', 'family', 'living', 'guest', 'house', 'niece', 'home', 'Veteran', 'housing', 'was', 'not', 'liking', 'burnt', 'many', 'bridges', 'family', 'prickly', 'demeanor', 'difficult', 'interact', 'others', 'walks', 'Charlie', 'young', 'prep', 'school', 'student', 'looking', 'extra', 'cash', 'order', 'afford', 'plane', 'ticket', 'home', 'Christmas', 'ad', 'basically', 'babysit', 'Slade', 'Thanksgiving', 'weekend', 'so', 'niece', 'family', 'can', 'go', 'vacation', 'Little', 'Charlie', 'know', 'Slade', 'other', 'plans', 'Shortly', 'niece', 'gone', 'taxi', 'taking', 'Slade', 'Charlie', 'airport', 'are', 'going', 'little', 'trip', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'where', 'Slade', 'reuniting', 'brother', 'eating', 'fine', 'restaurant', 'making', 'love', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'then', 'killing', 'Charlie', ""n't"", 'really', 'keen', 'whole', 'idea', 'last', 'part', 'especially', 'Frank', 'very', 'persuasive', 'should', 'say', 'aggressive', 'so', 'Charlie', 'most', 'part', 'film', 'excels', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'relationship', 'Frank', 'Charlie', 'sweet', 'sincere', 'fears', 'corrode', 'Frank', 'demeanor', 'are', 'believable', 'just', 'wish', 'were', 'addressed', 'little', 'more', 'authentically', 'sudden', 'shift', 'close', 'trip', 'little', 'too', 'abrupt', 'feel', 'honest', 'Sure', 'parts', 'can', 'seem', 'tad', 'hokey', 'Ferrari', 'scene', 'work', 'atmosphere', 'created', 'film', 'just', 'entire', 'school', 'subplot', 'so', 'ridiculous', 'entire', 'film', 'area', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'go', 'closing', 'hearing', 'was', 'kind', 'disgusting', 'Pacino', 'monologue', 'overdone', 'reaction', 'afterwards', 'was', 'unintentionally', 'hilarious', 'site', 'reviewer', 'was', 'correct', 'when', 'made', 'connection', 'Dead', 'Poets', 'Society', 'film', 'roll', 'eyes', 'was', 'just', 'waiting', 'students', 'hoist', 'Frank', 'Charlie', 'shoulders', 'carry', 'auditorium.And', 'then', 'Pacino', 'hate', 'what', 'been', 'reduced', 'basically', 'caricature', 'own', 'persona', 'film', 'will', 'say', 'totally', 'understand', 'why', 'won', 'Oscar', 'First', 'all', 'ridiculously', 'convincing', 'playing', 'blind', 'Second', 'right', 'scenes', 'win', 'Oscar', 'kill', 'everyone', 'drunk', 'day', 'HE', 'YELLS', 'Third', 'was', 'overdue', 'large', 'margin', 'said', 'are', 'basing', 'merit', 'performance', 'alone', 'was', 'far', 'too', 'uneven', 'here', 'fact', 'only', 'scene', 'really', 'felt', 'genuine', 'just', 'perfect', 'was', 'tango', 'scene', 'was', 'marvelous', 'there', 'Pacino', 'often', 'reverted', 'overacting', 'yelling', 'overselling', 'everything', 'point', 'where', 'felt', 'phony', 'understand', 'whole', 'character', 'thing', 'such', 'thing', 'subtlety', 'were', 'so', 'many', 'opportunities', 'use', 'subtlety', 'convey', 'deeper', 'emotion', 'Frank', 'especially', 'when', 'breaking', 'down', 'life', 'scene', 'really', 'thanks', 'subtlety', 'Pacino', 'part', 'scene', 'brother', 'home', 'just', 'wish', 'had', 'expounded', 'side', 'Frank', 'little', 'more.He', 'not', 'bad', 'Eastwood', 'Rae', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'especially', 'Washington', 'were', 'better', 'him.At', 'end', 'day', 'liked', 'movie', ""'d"", 'watch', 'again', ""'d"", 'even', 'recommend', 'film', 'not', 'great', 'barely', 'good', 'when', 'look', 'whole', 'can', 'delete', 'last', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'mind', 'may', 'have', 'really', 'good', 'buddy', 'flick']",N/A
44620,A1PASRZ81DY9C,0783204914,Austin Somlo,"[0, 7]","Viewed: 8/12Rate: 48/12: Lawrence of Arabia is clocked at 228 minutes. The Godfather is clocked at 178 minutes. Mutinty on the Bounty (1962) is clocked at 132 minutes. Scent of a *ussy is clocked at 157 minutes. Now, I can stand the running times of the first three and do not complain because they are epic pictures. However, Scent of a *ussy is almost three freaking hours long and is not even an epic! While watching it, I constantly asked myself, ""How much longer is this going to be?"" It's usually over 90 minutes to go. My goodness...the scenes could have been cut out, and it won't make a difference in the overall story. Think of all of the films that Al Pacino is famous for: The Godfather, Serpico, The Godfather Part II, Dog Day Afternoon, Scarface, Carlito's Way, and Glengarry Glen Ross. Now, how many Oscars has he won for them? Zero. And he freaking won it for Scent of a *ussy??? This worthless piece of crap??? He actually won the thing for this stupid piece of tripe?? Notice the last word in the title Scent of a *ussy. It is what exactly the film is all about: whether it's Charlie or the women; makes no difference to me. The moments are so unrealistic that they will never happen in real life. Charlie goes to New York City after agreeing to do a simple caretaker job for the weekend? Will never happen. He is too much of a wimp to do anything. After so long, Charlie is willing to take verbal abuse and be ordered around by Frank like that? Will never happen. The woman accepts the offer to tango and be watched by everybody else in the fancy restaurant? Will never happen. Too damn embarrassing for her. Frank goes to his brother's house and takes control of the dinner while his relatives stand for it? Will never happen. Realistically, he would have been forbidden to step in the house at the outset. Remember Charlie staying in the limo and waiting on Frank while he has fun with a hooker in her apartment? Pretty insulting, is it? Now, now...why would Charlie want to give up his life? Why does he care whether Frank wants to kill himself or not? Good riddance, if I must say...and to end the film faster. The reason why I stayed to the end is because I wanted to see what happened in the kangaroo court apropos of Charlie's fate. It turns out to be a neutral result: nobody got found out or was punished. Useless ordeal, if you must ask me. That scene where Frank gives his profanity laced speech? Will never happen. In fact, in reality, after the first word is uttered, the speech will end, and Frank will be escorted out after being discredited. Al Pacino gave a better speech in City Hall which was very classy, Al Pacino-like. Hearing why he became blind, I presume reasonably that Frank is dismissed (a.k.a dishonorably discharged) and can't be referred to as the lieutenant colonel anymore. Henceforth, he is ineligible for disability checks and VA benefits. And if he allowed himself saluted as the colonel, then he would have forced by honor to correct the reference, but it's moot already. All in all, I want to you imagine Al Pacino with the eyes all bugged out of his lizard face...inhaling deeply...hands on the table: that's the film Scent of a *ussy.",2,Almost Three Freaking Hours Long.,1345680000,"08 23, 2012",2012,3193,"['Viewed', '8/12Rate', '48/12', 'Lawrence', 'Arabia', 'clocked', '228', 'minutes', 'Godfather', 'clocked', '178', 'minutes', 'Mutinty', 'Bounty', '1962', 'clocked', '132', 'minutes', 'Scent', '*ussy', 'clocked', '157', 'minutes', 'Now', 'can', 'stand', 'running', 'times', 'first', 'three', 'do', 'not', 'complain', 'are', 'epic', 'pictures', 'However', 'Scent', '*ussy', 'almost', 'three', 'freaking', 'hours', 'long', 'not', 'even', 'epic', 'watching', 'constantly', 'asked', 'How', 'much', 'longer', 'going', 'be', 'usually', '90', 'minutes', 'go', 'goodness', 'scenes', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'cut', 'out', 'wo', ""n't"", 'make', 'difference', 'overall', 'story', 'Think', 'films', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'famous', 'Godfather', 'Serpico', 'Godfather', 'Part', 'II', 'Dog', 'Day', 'Afternoon', 'Scarface', 'Carlito', 'Way', 'Glengarry', 'Glen', 'Ross', 'Now', 'how', 'many', 'Oscars', 'won', 'Zero', 'freaking', 'won', 'Scent', '*ussy', 'worthless', 'piece', 'crap', 'actually', 'won', 'thing', 'stupid', 'piece', 'tripe', 'Notice', 'last', 'word', 'title', 'Scent', '*ussy', 'what', 'exactly', 'film', 'Charlie', 'women', 'difference', 'moments', 'are', 'so', 'unrealistic', 'will', 'never', 'happen', 'real', 'life', 'Charlie', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'agreeing', 'do', 'simple', 'caretaker', 'job', 'weekend', 'Will', 'never', 'happen', 'too', 'much', 'wimp', 'do', 'anything', 'so', 'long', 'Charlie', 'willing', 'take', 'verbal', 'abuse', 'be', 'ordered', 'Frank', 'Will', 'never', 'happen', 'woman', 'offer', 'tango', 'be', 'watched', 'everybody', 'else', 'fancy', 'restaurant', 'Will', 'never', 'happen', 'Too', 'damn', 'embarrassing', 'Frank', 'brother', 'house', 'control', 'dinner', 'relatives', 'stand', 'Will', 'never', 'happen', 'Realistically', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'forbidden', 'step', 'house', 'outset', 'Remember', 'Charlie', 'staying', 'limo', 'waiting', 'Frank', 'fun', 'hooker', 'apartment', 'Pretty', 'insulting', 'Now', 'now', 'why', 'would', 'Charlie', 'want', 'give', 'up', 'life', 'Why', 'care', 'Frank', 'kill', 'not', 'Good', 'riddance', 'must', 'say', 'end', 'film', 'faster', 'reason', 'why', 'stayed', 'end', 'wanted', 'see', 'what', 'happened', 'kangaroo', 'court', 'apropos', 'Charlie', 'fate', 'out', 'be', 'neutral', 'result', 'nobody', 'got', 'found', 'out', 'was', 'punished', 'Useless', 'ordeal', 'must', 'ask', 'scene', 'where', 'Frank', 'profanity', 'laced', 'speech', 'Will', 'never', 'happen', 'fact', 'reality', 'first', 'word', 'uttered', 'speech', 'will', 'end', 'Frank', 'will', 'be', 'escorted', 'out', 'being', 'discredited', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'gave', 'better', 'speech', 'City', 'Hall', 'was', 'very', 'classy', 'Al', 'Pacino-like', 'Hearing', 'why', 'became', 'presume', 'reasonably', 'Frank', 'dismissed', 'a.k.a', 'dishonorably', 'discharged', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'referred', 'lieutenant', 'colonel', 'anymore', 'Henceforth', 'ineligible', 'disability', 'checks', 'VA', 'benefits', 'allowed', 'saluted', 'colonel', 'then', 'would', 'have', 'forced', 'honor', 'correct', 'reference', 'moot', 'already', 'want', 'imagine', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'eyes', 'bugged', 'lizard', 'face', 'inhaling', 'deeply', 'table', 'film', 'Scent', '*ussy']",N/A

44628,A3IY28PW12MSVN,0783204914,Christine Wong,"[4, 5]","A little long, but still a very enjoyable movie; capped off with a wonderful performance from the always-dependable and masterful Al PacinoCharlie (Chris O'Donnell) knows who participated in a practical joke on headmaster Trask, but can't decide whether to snitch or not.  He is given the opportunity to think it over during the Thanksgiving weekend, and it is during this weekend that he decides to take a deceptively simple job house-sitting the retired and blind Col. Frank Slade (Pacino).  However, Charlie finds his situation is complicated by Slade's decision to go to New York for the weekend and intention to have a good time before ""blowing [his] brains out"".Al Pacino FINALLY won the Best Actor Oscar for his role as the blind and abrasive Col. Frank Slade in Martin Brest's ""Scent of a Woman.""  It is one of his best performances, and he rightly deserved an Oscar for it (especially after being snubbed by the Academy for his even better performances in The Godfather I and II and ""Dog Day Afternoon"").  Pacino makes the foul-mouthed and abrasive Col. Slade into someone sympathetic and even lovable.  Much of this comes from Pacino's natural charm, but his performance never becomes too sentimental, which is admirable.  Also, Pacino plays a blind man very convincingly, and he did it without cheating (i.e. wearing sunglasses, wearing contacts, etc.).  It really is a masterful performance.Although the movie could have easily been shortened by half an hour, this film has its (many) delightful moments.  Perhaps the best scene in the film is Col. Slade's awkward but really beautiful tango with Donna (the gorgeous Gabrielle Anwar).  The mere premise of a blind man, who feels spiritually dead, tangoing and laughing and having a great time with a beautiful young lady is hypnotic, in a way.  You'll have to see it to know what I mean.  (The music to which they tango is also lovely.)  Other fantastic scenes that really showcase Pacino's acting include his appearance at the family dinner, the scene where he learns to drive a Ferrari, and the scene at the hotel where he decides to blow his brains out.  Even in the quieter moments, as when Pacino says goodbye to Charlie and feels his face, the mere gestures make this movie even better.In addition, the dialogue is often coarse and witty.  Col. Slade's trademark ""Hoo-Hah!"" is hilarious.  His musings on women and cars are bitingly funny.

I find it one of those movies that becomes hypnotic a few minutes into it. Al Pacino is absolutely outstanding in the role of Lieutenant Colonel Frank  Slade, retired from the U.S. Army. Slade, blinded by a drinking/grenade  game he was playing with one of his drinking buddies, is now living as an  embittered alcoholic with an adult niece, her husband and two little  children. He is an arrogant, angry man used to issuing orders and not  displaying very much gratitude or affection.Charlie Simms, played well  by Chris O'Donnell, is a scholarship at a nearby prep school in the same  town in New Hampshire where Slade lives. Charlie's trying to earn some  money over the Thanksgiving weekend so that he can travel home to his  parents in Oregon at the Christmas break.He discovers an ad placed by  Slade's niece to care for her blind uncle over the Thanksgiving break so  that she can travel with her husband and kids to Albany, New York for  Thanksgiving with her in-laws.Charlie answers the ad and the adventure  quickly develops.Slade has his own plans for Thanksgiving. A last big  blowout in New York City before killing himself.He is abusive to Charlie  at first and acts as if he is one of his military aides. He doesn't let him  in on his plans until it's practically time to leave for New York -- while  Charlie had been told by Slade's niece that the weekend would be at her  home looking after her uncle.A beautiful bonding begins as Slade and  Simms interact and except for his anger and bitterness, it is obvious that  Slade is not particularly handicapped by his blindness as he has developed  an extra few &quot;senses&quot; which make him seem remarkable.The  journey to New York is a roller coaster of emotion from comic to touching  to almost tragic. When Slade finally decides to kill himself, Charlie  manages to save the day -- although it's pretty touch and go keeping you on  the edge of your seat throughout.Charlie has problems of his own. He's  not particularly self confident and Slade is tremendously intimidating.  Charlie's other problems center around an incident at school which places  him at a crossroads -- whether he should rat on some kids at school at the  headmaster's own brand of intimidation, or face expulsion.The movie  concludes with an impassioned speech by Colonel Slade on Charlie' behalf  before a school-wide assembly being held for a disciplinary committee  hearing on the incident Charlie has knowledge of.Simms remains true to  himself and proves himself to show new confidence and an outstanding sense  of personal integrity.Slade has also benefited by his own plans gone  awry and his opening a window of care for Charlie as another human being.  He emerges as a sign of hope to overcome his bitterness, anger and  alcoholism.An absolutely remarkable film!!!",5,One of This Decade's Best Films,924912000,"04 24, 1999",1999,2883,"['have', 'probably', 'watched', 'quot', 'Scent', 'A', 'Woman', 'quot', 'thirty', 'times', 'find', 'one', 'movies', 'hypnotic', 'few', 'minutes', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'absolutely', 'outstanding', 'role', 'Lieutenant', 'Colonel', 'Frank', 'Slade', 'retired', 'U.S.', 'Army', 'Slade', 'blinded', 'drinking/grenade', 'game', 'was', 'playing', 'one', 'drinking', 'buddies', 'now', 'living', 'embittered', 'alcoholic', 'adult', 'niece', 'husband', 'two', 'little', 'children', 'arrogant', 'angry', 'man', 'used', 'issuing', 'orders', 'not', 'displaying', 'very', 'much', 'gratitude', 'affection.Charlie', 'Simms', 'played', 'well', 'Chris', ""O'Donnell"", 'scholarship', 'nearby', 'prep', 'school', 'same', 'town', 'New', 'Hampshire', 'where', 'Slade', 'Charlie', 'trying', 'earn', 'money', 'Thanksgiving', 'weekend', 'so', 'can', 'travel', 'home', 'parents', 'Oregon', 'Christmas', 'break.He', 'ad', 'placed', 'Slade', 'niece', 'care', 'blind', 'uncle', 'Thanksgiving', 'break', 'can', 'travel', 'husband', 'kids', 'Albany', 'New', 'York', 'Thanksgiving', 'in-laws.Charlie', 'answers', 'ad', 'adventure', 'quickly', 'develops.Slade', 'own', 'plans', 'Thanksgiving', 'last', 'big', 'blowout', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'killing', 'himself.He', 'abusive', 'Charlie', 'first', 'as', 'one', 'military', 'aides', ""n't"", 'let', 'plans', 'practically', 'time', 'leave', 'New', 'York', 'Charlie', 'had', 'been', 'told', 'Slade', 'niece', 'weekend', 'would', 'be', 'home', 'looking', 'uncle.A', 'beautiful', 'bonding', 'Slade', 'Simms', 'interact', 'anger', 'bitterness', 'obvious', 'Slade', 'not', 'particularly', 'handicapped', 'blindness', 'developed', 'extra', 'few', 'quot', 'quot', 'make', 'seem', 'remarkable.The', 'journey', 'New', 'York', 'roller', 'coaster', 'emotion', 'comic', 'touching', 'almost', 'tragic', 'When', 'Slade', 'finally', 'kill', 'Charlie', 'save', 'day', 'pretty', 'touch', 'go', 'keeping', 'edge', 'seat', 'throughout.Charlie', 'problems', 'own', 'not', 'particularly', 'self', 'confident', 'Slade', 'tremendously', 'intimidating', 'Charlie', 'other', 'problems', 'center', 'incident', 'school', 'crossroads', 'should', 'rat', 'kids', 'school', 'headmaster', 'own', 'brand', 'intimidation', 'face', 'expulsion.The', 'movie', 'impassioned', 'speech', 'Colonel', 'Slade', 'Charlie', 'behalf', 'school-wide', 'assembly', 'being', 'held', 'disciplinary', 'committee', 'hearing', 'incident', 'Charlie', 'knowledge', 'of.Simms', 'true', 'show', 'new', 'confidence', 'outstanding', 'sense', 'personal', 'integrity.Slade', 'also', 'benefited', 'own', 'plans', 'gone', 'awry', 'opening', 'window', 'care', 'Charlie', 'human', 'being', 'sign', 'hope', 'overcome', 'bitterness', 'anger', 'alcoholism.An', 'absolutely', 'remarkable', 'film']",N/A
44632,A2GYX971VETQBV,0783204914,Daniel R. Sanderman,"[4, 4]","""Scent of a Woman"" finally won Al Pacino the award for Best Actor-an honor that, in my opinion, escaped him far too long.  His performance is wonderful, supplemented with the interesting dialogue that seems to be almost ad-libbed by Pacino himself.  Perhaps his acting is larger-than-life, but the character demands such a performance.  Frankly, I wouldn't have wanted to see the role fall apart in the hands of someone less experienced.The film does remind one of ""Dead Poet's Society,"" but quickly diverges into a rich character exploration while both Lt. Col. Slade and Charlie live it up in New York City.  One question I have for the defense of Charlie: why, in the end, does he want to be associated with the institution that grinds against his principles?  It seems that Slade's advice should be for him to join an institution that he feels proud to be a part of.  Regardless, the ending scenes of the film are wonderful to watch time and time again, particularly if you enjoy moving speeches as much as I do.The film is a bit long; it has several climaxes that confuse the audience as to when the film should end.

Frank unexpectedly takes Charlie on a luxurious trip to New York, where Frank plans to sample the best that life has to offer before taking his own life.  Charlie, meanwhile, is struggling with the morality of whether to inform on some fellow classmates whom he witnessed setting up a practical joke to humiliate the headmaster of the school (James Rebhorn).After some truly great performances, it's a shame that this is the film that finally won Pacino his Oscar.  He's effective, as always, but the majority of his performance is over-the-top bluster and shouting of the type that has become almost stereotypical for him.  The screenplay (by Bo Goldman) is strictly formulaic; once it creaks into motion, there is never any doubt about where it is headed.  Along the way, we are treated to ridiculous scenes such as a blind tango and a test drive in a Porsche with the blind Slade hurtling through the streets of New York at 90 mph without encountering pedestrians, other traffic, or drifting off the road.  He even makes some hairpin turns!The film is also morally confused.  The great dilemma in Charlie's life is whether to become a snitch.  The filmmakers seem to take the position that informing on another is always wrong, no matter how illegal, harmful, or stupid the incident concerned.  Goldman goes to great pains to present headmaster Trask as a dislikeable man so that he will lose audience sympathy.  But that doesn't make him wrong.  Charlie's classmates perpetrated a stupid prank with the sole intention of putting down another person.  Add to this the fact they are perfectly satisfied to sit back in silence to let Charlie take the fall for something he didn't do, and I am at a loss as to why Charlie should be expected to feel any loyalty toward them at all.  The prestigious Baird School will no doubt produce the type of leaders that we have had too many of in the past, men who will stonewall press and public to protect their cronies from facing the consequences of their misdeeds.",2,Morally confused and formulaic,1121644800,"07 18, 2005",2005,2162,"['Charlie', 'Chris', ""O'Donnell"", 'prep', 'school', 'student', 'scholarship', 'weekend', 'job', 'supervising', 'blind', 'former', 'army', 'officer', 'Frank', 'Slade', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'Frank', 'unexpectedly', 'Charlie', 'luxurious', 'trip', 'New', 'York', 'where', 'Frank', 'sample', 'best', 'life', 'offer', 'taking', 'own', 'life', 'Charlie', 'meanwhile', 'struggling', 'morality', 'inform', 'fellow', 'classmates', 'whom', 'witnessed', 'setting', 'up', 'practical', 'joke', 'humiliate', 'headmaster', 'school', 'James', 'Rebhorn', '.After', 'truly', 'great', 'performances', 'shame', 'film', 'finally', 'won', 'Pacino', 'Oscar', 'effective', 'always', 'majority', 'performance', 'over-the-top', 'bluster', 'shouting', 'type', 'become', 'almost', 'stereotypical', 'screenplay', 'Bo', 'Goldman', 'strictly', 'formulaic', 'motion', 'never', 'doubt', 'where', 'headed', 'way', 'are', 'treated', 'ridiculous', 'scenes', 'such', 'blind', 'tango', 'test', 'drive', 'Porsche', 'blind', 'Slade', 'hurtling', 'streets', 'New', 'York', '90', 'mph', 'encountering', 'pedestrians', 'other', 'traffic', 'drifting', 'off', 'road', 'even', 'hairpin', 'film', 'also', 'morally', 'confused', 'great', 'dilemma', 'Charlie', 'life', 'become', 'snitch', 'filmmakers', 'seem', 'take', 'position', 'informing', 'always', 'wrong', 'matter', 'how', 'illegal', 'harmful', 'stupid', 'incident', 'concerned', 'Goldman', 'great', 'pains', 'present', 'headmaster', 'Trask', 'dislikeable', 'man', 'so', 'will', 'lose', 'audience', 'sympathy', ""n't"", 'make', 'wrong', 'Charlie', 'classmates', 'perpetrated', 'stupid', 'prank', 'sole', 'intention', 'putting', 'down', 'person', 'Add', 'fact', 'are', 'perfectly', 'satisfied', 'sit', 'back', 'silence', 'let', 'Charlie', 'take', 'fall', 'something', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'am', 'loss', 'why', 'Charlie', 'should', 'be', 'expected', 'feel', 'loyalty', 'prestigious', 'Baird', 'School', 'will', 'doubt', 'produce', 'type', 'leaders', 'have', 'had', 'too', 'many', 'past', 'men', 'who', 'will', 'stonewall', 'press', 'public', 'protect', 'cronies', 'facing', 'consequences', 'misdeeds']",N/A

Al Pacino is Army Lieutenant Colonel Frank Slade, medically retired for blindness, who tows a reluctant Charlie Sims, actor Chris O'Donnell, to New York for a holiday bash.  While it starts out as ""Real Life 101"" for Charlie at the hands of the abrasive and experienced Frank who has been around the world three or four times, magic begins to happen as both get to know each other.Charlie faces possible expulsion from his school for disciplinary reasons, and Frank is tired of living as a recluse at his daughter's home.  The two meet when Charlie takes a job to look after Frank while his daughter is away for the holiday.  Frank has a grand plan to enjoy the fruits of life he has missed for years and their trip to New York exposes the innocent Charlie to some bold adventure regarding women, politics, war, liquor and Ferraris.  While Charlie's eyes are opened by Frank's candor about life, he also learns that Frank has lived in pain for several reasons and it's about to get the best of him.The real magic occurs as Charlie's discipline issue, awaiting his return from the holiday, resurrects Frank's Army officer instincts and it is this that affects major changes for both men in the coming days.  While there is a lot of humor and great moments, there are some dramatic scenes to stir your emotions.

44641,A11PTCZ2FM2547,0783204914,"D. Mikels ""It's always Happy Hour here""","[6, 6]","Look, Al Pacino is over the top and chews up every scene like a doberman with my slippers, but it doesn't matter.  SCENT OF A WOMAN is a grand vehicle for Pacino's antics; the story has meat on its bones, and the ending will leave you pumping your fist.As Army Lt. Col. (retired) Frank Slade, Pacino plays one ticked off hombre.  Mad at the world (due to being completely blind), Col. Slade is ready to call it quits. . .but first, he wants one last fling--over Thanksgiving Weekend, of all weekends--in the Big Apple.  Yet he needs a pair of eyes:  He finds them in young, peach-fuzzed Charlie Simms (Chris O'Donnell), an earnest student attending a New England prep school in the business of preparing its young skulls full of mush for entrance to Harvard.  Charlie has a few problems of his own, the biggest one being he's on the hot seat because he knows who the culprits of a mean-spirited prank are--but he's not wheeling to squeal on his classmates.So the Colonel and his young companion have spellbinding adventures in New York, culminating in a dramatic confrontation as Charlie tries to thwart the Colonel's date with a .45.  Meanwhile, there is a camaraderie--a rapport--that develops between the two characters; Charlie's naivete, his gleaming innocence, affects the curmudgeonly Colonel.  It overpowers, even changes him. . .so much so that Slade comes to Charlie's aid at his school's disciplinary hearing, where the retired Colonel gives a rousing speech, and subsequent dressdown, to the institution's snobbish dean (James Rebhorn).  The entire scene is one hundred and fifty percent riveting.Heck, SCENT OF A WOMAN in its totality is riveting--despite Pacino's constant rants and pity parties, which grow tiresome.  On the other hand, his portrayal of a blind man is utterly and completely convincing. You'll also notice a very young Philip Seymour Hoffman, who plays a preppie classmate of Charlie's.  Hoffman went on to say this role launched his career; and SCENT OF A WOMAN ain't a bad way to do that.--D.

SCENT OF A WOMAN provided Al Pacino a stage on which to perform a true character, unlike any he had played before, and make it one of those creations that still, 15 years later, evoke a smile and  applause.Blind, acerbic, loudmouthed, irascible Lieutenant Colonel Frank Slade (Pacino) hires preppy, in need of money, Charlie Simms (Chris O'Donnell) to escort him to New York for a 'final fling'.  Charlie has his own issues that depress him, but the two end up having such a grand time in New York that they bond strongly - until Slade dresses for his final moment.  The tearful Charlie convinces Slade not to off himself, Charlie's innate character wins Slade's gruff heart, and Slade ends up defending Charlie in an inforgettable prep school 'mock trial'.The complete manner in which Pacino inhabits this role is a stroke of studied genius: as a blind man his every physical and verbal movements are wholly convincing.  There are many fine moments in this film, not the least of which is the famous Tango scene, or the confrontation between Charlie and Slade regarding a suicide plan.  Pacino won Best Actor for his role and it is richly deserved. This is a film to cherish.  Highly Recommended.

On the one hand, it satisfies those seeking meaning and heart in a movie, yet on the other, it provides off-kilter humor from a known rough and tough actor, Al Pacino (Godfathers, Devil's Advocate).This film is the tale of a weekend spent between a crass, retired Lt. Col. (Pacino) who because of his individualism and disregard for personal safety was rendered blind late in his life, and a poor and timid prep high school student in O'Donnell, who agrees to ""babysit"" the retired war hero over Thanksgiving weekend. What Charlie (O'Donnell) doesn't know is that the colonel has planned a rambunctious trip which is set to end rather abruptly. The movie contains funny scenes with a blind Pacino driving a Ferrari and dancing the tango.A subplot exists, where Charlie is grappling with a moral dilemma at school, where he battles between snitching out a classmate, or keeping his ""honor."" Predictably, Col. Slade gets involved and offers his two cents, which provides for an adequate finish, with a gut-wrenching and heartwarming performance by Pacino securing him his first Best Actor Oscar.Pacino's acting as a blind man, though not perfect, is sufficient given the circumstances in the movie. He offers up kindness and ""pearls of wisdom"" by barking out orders.Many who saw this movie, had expected a pure mushy drama, and for those who sought this sort of medium, were most likely disappointed. The movie displays great balance in each individual's character, and successfully strays away from either being too mushy, or too crass.Where the film lacks overall balance is in the performance by O'Donnell. I know director Martin Brest wanted to achieve a sense of Pacino's and O'Donnell's being opposites, but this was taken too far it seems. Charlie (O'Donnell) releases too many ""duhs"" and ""aaahs"" among other various verbal fumblings to make his character believable. And although he doesn't stand anywhere close to Pacino in the actor's pyramid, this film does not do him justice; because, as his fans know, he does obtain a few nuggets of good acting.Otherwise, the movie is funny, and even at times tear-jerking, long yes, but well worth it.

Well, I don't know, but here goes my two  cents...This is one of my favorite movies of all time.  Al Pacino at one  of his very best moments.  Playing a role unlike any other of his career.  Chris O'Donnell at a perfect stage--before he his head became too big to  fit through doorways (as the result of such travesties as Batman or The  Bachelor).This is a very moving movie.  One that never fails to endear  itself further to me.  I've seen it more times than I care to remember, but  just yesterday, happened to catch it again on TNT. The channel surfing  stopped there, and I watched what (little) remained.I wager you will  love this movie as well.  One can't help but love it as they watch an  aging, blind Pacino come from despair to....well, I won't give away too  much for those of you who haven't seen it.But, a few scenes to look for  that are, by themselves, worthy of the price of this beauty:  (a) the  tango; (b) the test-drive; and (c) the speech.

44659,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,0783204914,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[3, 3]","This one is a masterpiece. First of all because Al Pacino cuts a character he is in no way close to being in real life. He plays a retired lieutenant-colonel which is nothing, but a blind one. His blindness is the symbol, and result, of both a heroic career and a sad end because he was passed over for general. This mixture of so many emotions and feelings and frustrations is marvelously conveyed by the actor. His tone, his behavior, his general stand, his unpredictable reactions, his decision to leave this world and his second decision to stay can be read in the way he speaks, the words he uses, the expressions his blind face carries, his attitudes toward other people, etc. He is a millionaire in emotions. But it is a masterpiece for so many other reasons that I am only going to quote a few. First it is a journey, the journey of a prep school teenager, a student on a scholarship mind you, from Oregon to Cambridge, Massachusetts, then to New York, a round trip with the colonel he is taking care of for the Thanksgiving long week end. This journey, and particularly the lap to New York and the subsequent events, are an initiation. The young chap is to learn what principles are in life and that you have to stand by them, especially if you are poor and fragile in body and social status: then be strong in soul and mind and spirit. Your ethics are your only asset and power in life. He also has to learn how to understand his colonel companion and feel when he has decided to send him buy cigars while he is putting an end to his life and the gun loaded with his bullets are an impressive key to the solitary tower of growing up with death in front of you. He saves that man with a crazy idea of a ride, for a blind man, to drive a Ferrari in the Bronx or somewhere under the Brooklyn Bridge, and with all the frills of such a ride including the cop who catches him speeding but does not realize he is talking to a blind man. But this film is also a film about the elite education these Ivy League prep schools provide the young men of today with to prepare them to be the leaders of tomorrow. There I will not hint too much at that side of the story. Let's say an act of vandalism which is a student prank and nothing more, leads the headmaster into menacing the two student witnesses (our poor one and a rich kid) with the worst punishment going as far as trying to buy the cooperation of the poor student. The final disciplinary hearing is absurd in its logic. The three culprits go through because there is no clear cut witness, the rich one, with his father, pretends he did not have his contacts on but gives the three names with a maybe, and the poor one, Charlie by the way, refuses point blank to be a fink, a stool pigeon. And there the intervention of his would-be-and-could-have-been-suicidee colonel saves the day. That you will have to find out by yourself. In many ways it is a lot stronger than the Dead Poets Society and the drama is avoided. It is better because it is the vision of a poor scholarship student and not the vision of one rich kid, in recent society and not in the 1920s or so. The point of view makes it a lot more powerful about society and courage, even if less dramatic as for the relations between the rich kid and his father. The loser all along is the headmaster who did not know how to recognize a prank and over-estimated it into an act of vandalism. Yes that kind of repressive attitude produces soul cripples and there is no prosthesis for that type of amputation.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 12 Cr&eacute;teil, CEGID",5,"Squalor is in the heart, just like courage and love",1254268800,"09 30, 2009",2009,3623,"['one', 'masterpiece', 'First', 'all', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'character', 'way', 'close', 'being', 'real', 'life', 'retired', 'lieutenant-colonel', 'nothing', 'blind', 'one', 'blindness', 'symbol', 'result', 'heroic', 'career', 'sad', 'end', 'was', 'passed', 'general', 'mixture', 'so', 'many', 'emotions', 'feelings', 'frustrations', 'marvelously', 'conveyed', 'actor', 'tone', 'behavior', 'general', 'stand', 'unpredictable', 'reactions', 'decision', 'leave', 'world', 'second', 'decision', 'stay', 'can', 'be', 'read', 'way', 'words', 'expressions', 'blind', 'face', 'attitudes', 'other', 'people', 'etc', 'millionaire', 'emotions', 'masterpiece', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'reasons', 'am', 'only', 'going', 'quote', 'few', 'First', 'journey', 'journey', 'prep', 'school', 'teenager', 'student', 'scholarship', 'mind', 'Oregon', 'Cambridge', 'Massachusetts', 'then', 'New', 'York', 'round', 'trip', 'colonel', 'taking', 'care', 'Thanksgiving', 'long', 'week', 'end', 'journey', 'particularly', 'lap', 'New', 'York', 'subsequent', 'events', 'are', 'initiation', 'young', 'chap', 'learn', 'what', 'principles', 'are', 'life', 'have', 'stand', 'especially', 'are', 'poor', 'fragile', 'body', 'social', 'status', 'then', 'be', 'strong', 'soul', 'mind', 'spirit', 'ethics', 'are', 'only', 'asset', 'power', 'life', 'also', 'learn', 'how', 'understand', 'colonel', 'companion', 'feel', 'when', 'decided', 'send', 'buy', 'cigars', 'putting', 'end', 'life', 'gun', 'loaded', 'bullets', 'are', 'impressive', 'key', 'solitary', 'tower', 'growing', 'up', 'death', 'front', 'man', 'crazy', 'idea', 'ride', 'blind', 'man', 'drive', 'Ferrari', 'Bronx', 'somewhere', 'Brooklyn', 'Bridge', 'frills', 'such', 'ride', 'including', 'cop', 'who', 'speeding', 'not', 'realize', 'talking', 'blind', 'man', 'film', 'also', 'film', 'elite', 'education', 'Ivy', 'League', 'prep', 'schools', 'provide', 'young', 'men', 'today', 'prepare', 'be', 'leaders', 'tomorrow', 'will', 'not', 'hint', 'too', 'much', 'side', 'story', 'Let', 'say', 'act', 'vandalism', 'student', 'prank', 'nothing', 'more', 'headmaster', 'menacing', 'two', 'student', 'witnesses', 'poor', 'one', 'rich', 'kid', 'worst', 'punishment', 'going', 'as', 'far', 'trying', 'buy', 'cooperation', 'poor', 'student', 'final', 'disciplinary', 'hearing', 'absurd', 'logic', 'three', 'culprits', 'go', 'clear', 'cut', 'witness', 'rich', 'one', 'father', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'contacts', 'three', 'names', 'maybe', 'poor', 'one', 'Charlie', 'way', 'point', 'blank', 'be', 'fink', 'stool', 'pigeon', 'intervention', 'would-be-and-could-have-been-suicidee', 'colonel', 'day', 'will', 'have', 'find', 'out', 'many', 'ways', 'lot', 'stronger', 'Dead', 'Poets', 'Society', 'drama', 'avoided', 'better', 'vision', 'poor', 'scholarship', 'student', 'not', 'vision', 'one', 'rich', 'kid', 'recent', 'society', 'not', '1920s', 'so', 'point', 'view', 'lot', 'more', 'powerful', 'society', 'courage', 'even', 'less', 'dramatic', 'relations', 'rich', 'kid', 'father', 'loser', 'along', 'headmaster', 'who', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'how', 'recognize', 'prank', 'over-estimated', 'act', 'vandalism', 'Yes', 'kind', 'repressive', 'attitude', 'soul', 'cripples', 'prosthesis', 'type', 'amputation.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU', 'University', 'Paris', '1', 'Pantheon', 'Sorbonne', 'University', 'Paris', '12', 'Cr', 'eacute', 'CEGID']",N/A

Christal,"[1, 9]","Scent of the Woman has a bit of a blandish, mainstream story, but luckily (mainly since it's not the greatest) it sticks to the worth of it's dialog and actors. Brief plot summary goes as this: a prep kid needs money so he takes a job looking after a blind old guy who lives in a cottage with his family. If that was it, this movie wouldn't have even gotten off the ground, but then something interesting happens: the old guy is quite the classic nut-job.Lieutenant Colonel Frank Slade, giving Charlie (Chris O'Donnell) a pre-planned Thanksgiving weekend, is played by Al Pacino in the best of his abilities.  The &quot;hoo-ha&quot; stuff could get old to some, but if you have a sense of humor with Pacino's mannerisms after a while, it sort of acts like comic relief during the more intense segments.If you take the Pacino/O'Donnell act of the film (sort of like taking the entire 90 minutes of Tom Hanks on Cast Away island and sea), you almost have a masterwork of acting style over substance, but the film also has some un-needed filler for Charlie back at his campus. Still, Pacino rules (wish he'd try to look somewhat into someone's eyes even if he's blind), and gives a deserved, Oscar garnering performance....By the way, this DVD is barebones in extras, has fine picture wquality with 2.0 Dolby Digital, yet only has the coutesy to leave Production Notes (as a movie it would be 4, but the DVD gets a 2, so it averages out).",3,"Longish, stubborn, but entertaining",1060387200,"08 9, 2003",2003,1435,"['Scent', 'Woman', 'bit', 'blandish', 'mainstream', 'story', 'luckily', 'mainly', 'not', 'greatest', 'worth', 'dialog', 'actors', 'Brief', 'plot', 'summary', 'prep', 'kid', 'money', 'job', 'looking', 'blind', 'old', 'guy', 'who', 'cottage', 'family', 'was', 'movie', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'even', 'gotten', 'off', 'ground', 'then', 'something', 'interesting', 'happens', 'old', 'guy', 'quite', 'classic', 'nut-job.Lieutenant', 'Colonel', 'Frank', 'Slade', 'giving', 'Charlie', 'Chris', ""O'Donnell"", 'pre-planned', 'Thanksgiving', 'weekend', 'played', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'best', 'abilities', 'quot', 'hoo-ha', 'quot', 'stuff', 'could', 'get', 'old', 'have', 'sense', 'humor', 'Pacino', 'mannerisms', 'while', 'sort', 'acts', 'comic', 'relief', 'more', 'intense', 'segments.If', 'take', ""Pacino/O'Donnell"", 'act', 'film', 'sort', 'taking', 'entire', '90', 'minutes', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'Cast', 'Away', 'island', 'sea', 'almost', 'have', 'masterwork', 'acting', 'style', 'substance', 'film', 'also', 'un-needed', 'filler', 'Charlie', 'back', 'campus', 'Still', 'Pacino', 'rules', 'wish', ""'d"", 'try', 'look', 'somewhat', 'someone', 'eyes', 'even', 'blind', 'deserved', 'Oscar', 'garnering', 'performance', 'way', 'DVD', 'barebones', 'extras', 'fine', 'picture', 'wquality', '2.0', 'Dolby', 'Digital', 'yet', 'only', 'coutesy', 'leave', 'Production', 'Notes', 'movie', 'would', 'be', '4', 'DVD', '2', 'out']",N/A

If I saw a red ferrari driving down my street, my father alluded to the infamous racing scene in Scent of a Woman.When I stepped into my public library a few weeks I was lurking down the aisles without any intentions or expectations until I looked down. There it was, Scent of a Woman. I thought to myself, It is time.Charlie Simms played by (Chris O'Donnell) attends an elite prep school (Baird) in the far new England region. In order to pay for his flight back home to Oregon for the Christmas holiday he searches for temporary work during the Thanksgiving day weekend. It is here where Charlie finds temporary work to look after a retired Army Ranger Lieutenant Colonel, Frank Slade. (Al Pacino)When Charlie and another student, George Willis Jr (Philip Seymour Hoffman) unexpectedly become witnesses to a prank for the school's headmaster, Mr. Trask, Charlie is offered a bribe:Squeal on the pranksters and an open spot at Harvard awaits Charlie.Upon Charlie's visit to Frank's dwelling, Charlie discovers that he is a blind, short tempered and rambunctious alcoholic. After an intimidating and initial confrontation Charlie becomes hesitant to succumb to the task. However, he accepts the task after realizing how much the favor means to Frank's family. What starts out on a quite and serene landscape quickly evolves into a dramatic, touching and fun filled adventure. And in New York City no less, or according to Frank, the freak show capital of the world. The interaction between Charlie and Frank is nothing short of spectacular; Charlie, an innocent, genuine and warm-hearted young man learns how to cope and eventually embrace Frank's outgoing and sometimes inappropriate behavior. The friendship that ensues is one of deep respect and love.On the day of Charlie's judgment, which is in front of the entire school body including the headmaster and the disciplinary members we witness Charlie's good natured character stay intact. He cannot and will not break his code of principle that conforms to a special type of value, integrity. Frank Slade describes and explains the underlying reason for Charlie's actions in a beautiful and emotionally powerful speech that is memorable. In front of the entire school, Frank questions the type of men Baird School is breeding for leadership. He also explains the psychological and spiritual impact of the headmaster's decision. As quoted from Frank Slade, ""there is no prosthesis for a broken spirit"".The film evokes strong feelings of triumph, courage, and respect. Chris O'Donnell and Al Pacino are electrifying in every scene. The parts of New York City are filmed beautifully and contrast very nicely against the landscapes of Baird School.

Scent of a Woman does this, it is a masterpiece.Al Pacino is brilliant as Lieutenant Colonel Frank Slade, a retired, arrogant, blind army veteran with a hell of a lot of charisma, in this film he is teamed up with Charlie Simms, a young shy college student with a lot to learn. During the thanksgiving holiday he decides to take up the job of taking care of the colonel whilst juggling with his school life problems and the fact that he has been unwillingly taken to New York City for a grand tour by the insistent Colonel. In New York, Charlie (played by Chris O' Donnell) finds out that Frank is planning on indulging in many luxuries before killing himself, Charlie decides to go along although his anxiety shows, he clearly wants to get the Colonel back to Massachussetts safe and sound, but does not seem to have the guts to stand up to the assertive man, bearing in mind he is in deep trouble with the college, and must decide on whether to snitch on some of his buddies for pulling a big prank on the headmaster, this problem could mean him being booted out, and if he conforms he is promised ( by the headmaster) to be boosted into Harvard, he is in a dilemma, the tension is conveyed well throughout the film by Chris O' Donnell and I think that was his best attribute to the film. He still doesn't come close to out-performing Pacino who deservedly won the Best Actor Oscar at the 1992 awards. The ending is even more tense, after avertting a potential suicide bid, Charlie and the Colonel head back to the Baird College for an assembly to see who takes the fall for the prank, with Charlie and his rich buddy (played brilliantly by Phillip Seymour Hoffman, you are made to hate him, he reinforces this feeling constantly, he does act very well) and it ends with the Colone and a magnificent speech that is loud but heartfelt and I love it.If you like ferraris, fantastic restaurants, sexual material, a bit on the guns, fantastic stories about soldiers juggling grenades, a fantasticly directed set by Martin Brest and Al Pacino in top form then you'll love this film, and everybody should.",5,HOOO-- HAH!!!!,1102032000,"12 3, 2004",2004,2501,"['film', 'classic', 'totally', 'modern', 'filming', 'what', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'well', 'made', 'tender', 'very', 'precise', 'should', 'incorporate', 'explosive', 'tense', 'scenes', 'sadness', 'elegeance', 'should', 'put', 'shy', 'confident', 'bring', 'out', 'best', 'guy', 'should', 'involve', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'single', 'handedly', 'other', 'actor', 'screen', 'unque', 'crisp', 'talents', 'Scent', 'Woman', 'masterpiece.Al', 'Pacino', 'brilliant', 'Lieutenant', 'Colonel', 'Frank', 'Slade', 'retired', 'arrogant', 'blind', 'army', 'veteran', 'hell', 'lot', 'charisma', 'film', 'teamed', 'up', 'Charlie', 'Simms', 'young', 'shy', 'college', 'student', 'lot', 'learn', 'thanksgiving', 'holiday', 'take', 'up', 'job', 'taking', 'care', 'colonel', 'whilst', 'juggling', 'school', 'life', 'problems', 'fact', 'been', 'unwillingly', 'taken', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'grand', 'tour', 'insistent', 'Colonel', 'New', 'York', 'Charlie', 'played', 'Chris', 'O', 'Donnell', 'out', 'Frank', 'planning', 'indulging', 'many', 'luxuries', 'killing', 'Charlie', 'go', 'along', 'anxiety', 'shows', 'clearly', 'get', 'Colonel', 'back', 'Massachussetts', 'safe', 'sound', 'not', 'seem', 'have', 'guts', 'stand', 'up', 'assertive', 'man', 'bearing', 'mind', 'deep', 'trouble', 'college', 'must', 'decide', 'snitch', 'buddies', 'pulling', 'big', 'prank', 'headmaster', 'problem', 'could', 'mean', 'being', 'booted', 'out', 'promised', 'headmaster', 'be', 'boosted', 'Harvard', 'dilemma', 'tension', 'conveyed', 'well', 'film', 'Chris', 'O', 'Donnell', 'think', 'was', 'best', 'attribute', 'film', 'still', ""n't"", 'come', 'close', 'out-performing', 'Pacino', 'who', 'deservedly', 'won', 'Best', 'Actor', 'Oscar', '1992', 'awards', 'ending', 'even', 'more', 'tense', 'avertting', 'potential', 'suicide', 'bid', 'Charlie', 'Colonel', 'head', 'back', 'Baird', 'College', 'assembly', 'see', 'who', 'fall', 'prank', 'Charlie', 'rich', 'buddy', 'played', 'brilliantly', 'Phillip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'are', 'made', 'hate', 'feeling', 'constantly', 'act', 'very', 'well', 'Colone', 'magnificent', 'speech', 'loud', 'heartfelt', 'love', 'it.If', 'ferraris', 'fantastic', 'restaurants', 'sexual', 'material', 'bit', 'guns', 'fantastic', 'stories', 'soldiers', 'juggling', 'grenades', 'fantasticly', 'directed', 'set', 'Martin', 'Brest', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'top', 'form', 'then', ""'ll"", 'love', 'film', 'everybody', 'should']",N/A

I do have trouble swallowing the tango scene, but otherwise it's quite a fine flick...I especially enjoyed the driving scene.  Being blind myself, I can very much identify with the struggles faced by Al Pacino's Lieutenant Colonel Frank Slade.  Mr. Pacino plays a fine blind man who, while having lost his sight, has not lost his understanding of the world around him, as quickly seen when he dispenses his advice that is only sometimes misguided.  Chris O'Donnell became Mr. Pacino's equal as they sparred over world views, weapons, morals, integrity, and the idea of wanting to keep on living.  These two gentlemen have fine chemistry from the beginning and it only builds on that throughout the film.  It was interesting to see a young Philip Seymour Hoffman playing the richey-rich prep school student who's morale compass doesn't seem to be as solid as our leading young lad's.  While many of the cast members played brief supporting roles, all were well-placed and put an effort into their parts that elevated the plot.  Speaking of plot, that was great from the beginning as well.  Who couldn't soon identify with the struggles faced by Al Pacino with his blindness while being simultaneously annoyed by his behavior?  Who couldn't feel as uncertain about what to do as Chris O'Donnell was in the face of witnessing the preparation of a school prank while under pressure from the school's headmaster?  By the way, James Rebhorn played a wonderfully slimy headmaster.  This was a great movie and I highly enjoyed it.  I myself am considering ideas for a long-awaited sequel.  Come on, Al Pacino!

44705,AW3FTPCBPVQNB,0783204914,Robert J. Schneider,"[5, 5]","Martin Brest's SCENT OF A WOMAN (1992) is a film well worth watching, and perhaps owning on video or DVD.  Beyond the rather slow pace and the tough-talking of some of its characters, this tale is a thoughtful and incisive look at human behavior and how life experiences can shape it.  It looks at how certain people handle adversity and what lessons they can ultimately derive from it.  If this analysis makes SCENT OF A WOMAN sound boring, please forgive me, for it is anything but boring.  This is a story about how real people react to real situations, and I'll be surprised if most people couldn't relate to at least one of the several major characters in it.  The film's characters are, by the way, anything but boring; rather, they are memorable and true-to-life.Chris O'Donnell was very young (only 22) when he played Charlie Simms in this, only his third movie role and first starring one.  You could say that he had his work cut out for him, as his co-star is living legend Al Pacino, as Lieutenant Colonel Frank Slade.  As you know by now, Charlie, a college student in hot water with the detestable Dean Trask (James Rebhorn, in another significant and well-played character role), gets himself assigned to the task of looking after the blind, bullying and seemingly unlikable Frank for Thanksgiving weekend.  As I'm sure you also know, Frank is suicidal and is planning on doing himself in, but not before treating himself to last weekend of wine, women and song--and bringing Charlie along for the ride, whether he likes it or not!  This story is about their weekend, and how each man is changed for the better, complete with a wonderful payoff at the end.When we first meet Frank Slade, we wonder if we can really spend a long time with him (this movie is 2 hours and 42 minutes long, although Frank is introduced about 20 minutes into it).  But the way in which Charlie influences his character growth really holds our attention. Eventually, we come to care so much about Frank through the realization that he is not a one-dimensional monster but a damaged human being; one that is more in need of redemption than offing.SCENT OF A WOMAN is extremely well-acted by everyone.  Al Pacino's memorable and infectious performance finally won him the Oscar for Best Actor that he had long deserved.  Perhaps even more impressively, Chris O'Donnell (keep in mind that this was only his third film ever) provides an effective counterpart; both actors create believable and effective chemistry in their interaction. A very young Philip Seymour Hoffman is also memorable in a showy supporting role. This is one of those films in which if you've never seen it before, it will make you smile.  Just don't be put off by its length; the characters and storyline will make you care enough to stick with it.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED",5,Excellent Film - Thoughtful and Poignant,1079136000,"03 13, 2004",2004,2825,"['Martin', 'Brest', 'SCENT', 'A', 'WOMAN', '1992', 'film', 'well', 'worth', 'watching', 'perhaps', 'owning', 'video', 'DVD', 'rather', 'slow', 'pace', 'tough-talking', 'characters', 'tale', 'thoughtful', 'incisive', 'look', 'human', 'behavior', 'how', 'life', 'experiences', 'can', 'shape', 'how', 'certain', 'people', 'handle', 'adversity', 'what', 'lessons', 'can', 'ultimately', 'derive', 'analysis', 'SCENT', 'A', 'WOMAN', 'sound', 'boring', 'please', 'forgive', 'anything', 'boring', 'story', 'how', 'real', 'people', 'react', 'real', 'situations', ""'ll"", 'be', 'surprised', 'most', 'people', 'could', ""n't"", 'relate', 'least', 'one', 'several', 'major', 'characters', 'film', 'characters', 'are', 'way', 'anything', 'boring', 'rather', 'are', 'memorable', 'true-to-life.Chris', ""O'Donnell"", 'was', 'very', 'young', 'only', '22', 'when', 'played', 'Charlie', 'Simms', 'only', 'third', 'movie', 'role', 'first', 'starring', 'one', 'could', 'say', 'had', 'work', 'cut', 'out', 'co-star', 'living', 'legend', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'Lieutenant', 'Colonel', 'Frank', 'Slade', 'know', 'now', 'Charlie', 'college', 'student', 'hot', 'water', 'detestable', 'Dean', 'Trask', 'James', 'Rebhorn', 'significant', 'well-played', 'character', 'role', 'assigned', 'task', 'looking', 'blind', 'bullying', 'seemingly', 'unlikable', 'Frank', 'Thanksgiving', 'weekend', ""'m"", 'sure', 'also', 'know', 'Frank', 'suicidal', 'planning', 'doing', 'not', 'treating', 'last', 'weekend', 'wine', 'women', 'song', 'bringing', 'Charlie', 'ride', 'not', 'story', 'weekend', 'how', 'man', 'changed', 'better', 'complete', 'wonderful', 'payoff', 'end.When', 'first', 'meet', 'Frank', 'Slade', 'wonder', 'can', 'really', 'spend', 'long', 'time', 'movie', '2', 'hours', '42', 'minutes', 'long', 'Frank', 'introduced', '20', 'minutes', 'way', 'Charlie', 'character', 'growth', 'really', 'attention', 'Eventually', 'come', 'care', 'so', 'much', 'Frank', 'realization', 'not', 'one-dimensional', 'monster', 'damaged', 'human', 'being', 'one', 'more', 'need', 'redemption', 'offing.SCENT', 'A', 'WOMAN', 'extremely', 'well-acted', 'everyone', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'memorable', 'infectious', 'performance', 'finally', 'won', 'Oscar', 'Best', 'Actor', 'had', 'long', 'deserved', 'Perhaps', 'even', 'more', 'impressively', 'Chris', ""O'Donnell"", 'keep', 'mind', 'was', 'only', 'third', 'film', 'ever', 'effective', 'counterpart', 'actors', 'create', 'believable', 'effective', 'chemistry', 'interaction', 'very', 'young', 'Philip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'also', 'memorable', 'showy', 'supporting', 'role', 'one', 'films', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'will', 'make', 'smile', 'Just', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'put', 'off', 'length', 'characters', 'storyline', 'will', 'make', 'care', 'enough', 'stick', 'it.HIGHLY', 'RECOMMENDED']",N/A

This is a little known movie with such great performances and acting all around. Rather long, the movie is about a retired, blind, bitter, Army Lieutenant Colonel (played by Al Pacino) and a young preppie (played by Chris O'Donnell). Both spending a wild weekend in New York City, both facing crisis in their lives, both learning about each other, both acquiring strength from each other to continuing on.(I am not saying more about the plot as it will spoil the fun).  I seen this movie for under $5.00 in a retailing store. What a shame, such a performance and great movie is worth a lot more!!!!

44707,A1TK6R2JSC97HL,0783204914,Rottenberg's rotten book review,"[3, 3]","It's Al Pacino again outpacing just about everybody else in the cast.  Here he plays Frank Slade, a retired, blind and embittered US Army officer unloaded on a young prep-school student for Thanksgiving.  Slade was brilliant and fearless, which meant he had no friends and was repeatedly passed over for bigger and better things.  Embittered and alcoholic, he tried juggling live grenades once and...something bad happened.  Blinded in the accident, Slade lives with the only family members who can stand his ranting - but the Colonel obliges them by keeping to his own room for most of the time, and by forming a secret plan that will put him out of everybody's misery.  Without giving away too much - the plan involves a room at the Waldorf in Manhattan, a bottle of the finest Jack Daniel's, Thanksgiving dinner with the relatives who couldn't stand to live with him, a night with the most expensive woman in Manhattan, a limo, his .45 service pistol...and one bullet.Unfortunately for the plan (but not for Frank) the prep school student assigned to nurse him through the weekend is Charlie Sims, played by Chris O'Donnel (a less confident and less immature and American version of Hugh Grant's shtick).  Sims has his own problems - expulsion from school, and from a more financially insured future unless he names students he saw involved in a prank against the school's pompous head dean.  The dilemma between losing his future and his honor plagues Charlie thruought the weekend, and only makes it easier for Frank to dragoon him into a jaunt to New York.  (Another student is also a witness, but that boy comes from a wealthy family and can afford to stay quiet) Over the weekend, Frank alternates between browbeating and educating Charlie in the ways of being a man, specifically an American man (between running for cover and facing the music, running is the better idea, Frank advises).  The script purposefully makes Sims a wuss if only to force Slade into seizing a cause more desperate than his own.  In the end, it's no surprise that Slade will come to the rescue, fighting for Charlie before the school board with an impassioned oratory that's pure Pacino.  ""(I'm out of order?  I'M OUT OF ORDER!?"")  Pacino plays well off the very soft-spoken O'Donnell without appearing to bully him, and fits in well with everybody else in a film cast heavily on character actors like James Reborn (you may remember the pompous dean who holds O'Donnell's future in his hands was also the weaselly SecDef from ""Independence Day"", the slick prosecutor from ""Carlito's Way"" or the sinister exec who talks Michael Douglas into joining ""The Game"".)

Sarhan ""matured reviewer""","[7, 7]","Al Pacino (Scarface) won his first Academy Award for Best Actor in 1992 when he starred in Scent Of A Woman, a movie directed by Martin Brest (Beverly Hills Cop) and co-starring Chris O'Donnell (Batman Forever).Pacino plays Lt. Colonel Frank Slade, a blind and retired military officer who spends thanksgiving weekend with his caretaker, a young and poor Oregon man named Charlie, played incredibly by O'Donnell, in New York City.Charlie goes to a rich boy's school, Baird, where he is held as a witness to a disciplinary issue revolving around an incident that humiliated the headmaster, who threatens expulsion for Charlie if he doesn't tell the board who the perpetrators were. On the other hand, the other witness is a rich man's kid, played by Phillip Seymour Hoffman (Capote), who eventually gets an easier treatment. Charlie decides to work over the thanksgiving vacation as a caretaker for Slade, whose family leave him to go out of town.Pacino's performance as Slade strikes gold. He's vicious and moody for a blind man, one who refuses to be held at the arm when walking, but he's also lonely, miserable and in need of a good time. Charlie accompanies Slade against his will to New York City where Slade has set an agenda that includes dining in a fancy restaurant, attending thanksgiving dinner at his estranged brother's house, dancing the tango with a beautiful woman, played by Gabrielle Anwar, driving a Ferrarri, getting laid, and finally blowing his brains out.What makes the movie engaging is the bond that we see gradually occuring between our grumpy old man and the sweet and sensitive young man, and how Slade stands up to the lonesome poor boy with a lot of integrity in the climactic disciplinary hearing scene.Scent Of A Woman is one of the best and most unforgettable motion pictures of the past 15 years.RecommendedA",5,Pacino...strikes gold!,1139097600,"02 5, 2006",2006,1842,"['Al', 'Pacino', 'Scarface', 'won', 'first', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Best', 'Actor', '1992', 'when', 'starred', 'Scent', 'A', 'Woman', 'movie', 'directed', 'Martin', 'Brest', 'Beverly', 'Hills', 'Cop', 'co-starring', 'Chris', ""O'Donnell"", 'Batman', 'Forever', '.Pacino', 'Lt', 'Colonel', 'Frank', 'Slade', 'blind', 'retired', 'military', 'officer', 'who', 'thanksgiving', 'weekend', 'caretaker', 'young', 'poor', 'Oregon', 'man', 'named', 'Charlie', 'played', 'incredibly', ""O'Donnell"", 'New', 'York', 'City.Charlie', 'rich', 'boy', 'school', 'Baird', 'where', 'held', 'witness', 'disciplinary', 'issue', 'revolving', 'incident', 'humiliated', 'headmaster', 'who', 'expulsion', 'Charlie', ""n't"", 'tell', 'board', 'who', 'perpetrators', 'were', 'other', 'hand', 'other', 'witness', 'rich', 'man', 'kid', 'played', 'Phillip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'Capote', 'who', 'eventually', 'easier', 'treatment', 'Charlie', 'work', 'thanksgiving', 'vacation', 'caretaker', 'Slade', 'family', 'leave', 'go', 'town.Pacino', 'performance', 'Slade', 'strikes', 'gold', 'vicious', 'moody', 'blind', 'man', 'one', 'who', 'be', 'held', 'arm', 'when', 'walking', 'also', 'lonely', 'miserable', 'need', 'good', 'time', 'Charlie', 'Slade', 'will', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'where', 'Slade', 'set', 'agenda', 'dining', 'fancy', 'restaurant', 'attending', 'thanksgiving', 'dinner', 'estranged', 'brother', 'house', 'dancing', 'tango', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'played', 'Gabrielle', 'Anwar', 'driving', 'Ferrarri', 'getting', 'laid', 'finally', 'blowing', 'brains', 'movie', 'engaging', 'bond', 'see', 'gradually', 'occuring', 'grumpy', 'old', 'man', 'sweet', 'sensitive', 'young', 'man', 'how', 'Slade', 'up', 'lonesome', 'poor', 'boy', 'lot', 'integrity', 'climactic', 'disciplinary', 'hearing', 'scene.Scent', 'A', 'Woman', 'one', 'best', 'most', 'unforgettable', 'motion', 'pictures', 'past', '15', 'years.RecommendedA']",N/A

There are movies that rely solely on the acting ability of it's cast.  This is one of those masterpieces.'Scent of a Woman' has been around for some years now, but I bet there are some kids that are now teenagers who have not seen it.  If you are younger and just starting to explore the older films of cinema, PLEASE PLEASE check this one out.  This film is why we go to the movies.**Some Minor Spoilers Ahead**For those who are not familier with this title, 'Scent...' focuses in on Liet. Col. Frank Slade (Retired) from the U.S. Army.  Frank is now blind and lives with his niece and her husband & kids.  He is not happy and spends most of his days drinking 'Jack Daniels' and listening music in the garage apartment he lives in.Enter (Chris O'Donald) aka ""Charlie Simms"".  Charlie needs some cash and answers an ad to spend a weekend watching Frank.  Frank's niece and husband are leaving for a much needed vacation and want someone to stay with him.  Charlie after an awkward interview with Frank is given the job by the niece.Well...long story short Charlie witnesses something at his school.  Something the Dean of the school is not happy about at all.  Charlie is bribed into giving a testimony about what he saw, when he returns from school break, in exchange for a free ride into Harvard.  He is unsure about this decision and this weighs on him quite a bit throughout the movie.When he shows up to watch the Colonel, what does he find...Frank is preparing for a trip to New York City, AND Charlie has to go with him.This is where the film really picks up and Pacino becomes quite a charming, entertaining character to watch.  He is quick with snappy lines and seems full of wisdom for the wet behind the ears Charlie.  But there is a darker purpose to this trip, one that will weigh on Charlie even more once he finds it out.Stellar performances by O'Donald and Pacino.  Pacino has the unique ability to make you love or hate Frank in this movie.  You laugh at his jokes one minute, and are practically crying for him the next.Excellant demonstration of how movies don't 200 million dollar special effects budgets to be awe-inspiring, just a well written screenplay and actors fully behind the project.  Also fun fact, Al does not blink the entire movie!!!  How he pulled this off, I have no idea.  But he truly acts like one who has lost their sight, going as far at never focusing his eyes in on anything.The film ends with one of the all-time best speechs ever given by a leading character.  Even better than the speech at the end of '300.'  Yeah, it's that good.Fantastic film, a must watch for every human being, young and old.

Intelligently written and movingly told.&#34; Similar to &#34;Dead Poets' Society&#34; ONLY with respect to its taking place at a prep school with Chris O'Donnell playing the role of Charlie, one of its less wealthy students, who must keep finding jobs in order to pay the tuition that his parents can't afford. This is the moving story of a retired - and blind - Lieutenant Colonel who has lived a long and interesting life but who is angry and bitter about his blindness and disgusted with life in general . . . until he meets Charlie, who was hired as a young guardian for the Colonel. Two more opposite personalities would be difficult to find, but as they get to know one another in only a few days' time, a deep friendship develops between the two. And, although Charlie thought this was just &#34;a job&#34; to help him pay his way through school, the last scene of the movie, brilliantly played by Pacino, shows how much respect the Colonel feels for Charlie's integrity for not &#34;ratting out&#34; some wealthy fellow students who played a stupid prank and incriminated each other. The last scene, in which Pacino defends Charlie at a school-wide committee meeting (to which Pacino hasn't been invited), to determine who was guilty of pulling the prank, is breathtakingly and heart-rendingly true and one of the very best of Pacino's performances. An amazing film in all respects! (I thought I'd taped this on VHS but discovered, to my chagrin, that I hadn't so I ordered it immediately!)

As sweet as the scent of a woman, it is the woman beneath the scent the retired Lieutenant Colonel Frank Slade, played by Al Pacino, has longed for all his life, and this is the final message of this remarkable film. Tough as nails, the blind military man rankles and spits and curses, making it impossible for the young college man, Charlie, played by Chris O'Donnell, to get along with him, let alone be weekend companion to him. Who, then, is the tougher one? Do as he might, Slade cannot rid himself of the college boy watching over his safety in an impromptu visit to New York City. Comes a time, he no longer wishes to; it is the boy who outlasts him in steely determination.Lieutenant Colonel Frank Slade has given up on life. He has lost his military career, once promising. He has lost his sight through machismo pranks of tossing grenades. He has lost the affection and support of his family through his impossible manner, save a daughter who loves him through clenched teeth. He has never been able to hold onto a woman, except for a woman's paid services. For his pleasure, indeed, he has only ever had the scent of a woman. The woman herself, her body purchased, her heart and spirit forever elusive to the man, requires far more courage to hold than that what is required in the escort services Slade relies upon. But Slade's courage is limited to military and machismo realms; he has none when it comes to the challenge of emotional courage.To his young and idealistic companion Charlie, everything Slade is not, or perhaps was, but long ago, Slade says in a critical moment: when in my life I have done the right thing, I did it to feel important. You do it because you are a man of integrity. Charlie tells Slade, you are not a bad man. You are hiding behind your fear.The impossible becomes possible when Charlie's idealism wins over Slade's moment of despair. Something heroic resides in Slade after all. When Charlie must make a difficult choice that involves a harsh test of his personal honor, Slade comes to his side. The resulting speech alone is worth the price of this film.Once Slade allows his integrity (and, yes, it was in him, beneath the fear) to surface, the scent of the woman at long last embodies the woman herself. A breakthrough always has that kind of dominoe effect, even in reality.Pacino's performance in this film is exemplary. O'Donnell, too, is first class, convincing in his portrayal of youth in all its bumbling innocence, as yet uncorrupted ideals.",5,And the scent is bitter sweet....,1073952000,"01 13, 2004",2004,2589,"['what', 'vinegar', 'bile', 'man', 'heart', 'when', 'life', 'love', 'As', 'sweet', 'scent', 'woman', 'woman', 'scent', 'retired', 'Lieutenant', 'Colonel', 'Frank', 'Slade', 'played', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'longed', 'life', 'final', 'message', 'remarkable', 'film', 'Tough', 'nails', 'blind', 'military', 'man', 'rankles', 'spits', 'curses', 'making', 'impossible', 'young', 'college', 'man', 'Charlie', 'played', 'Chris', ""O'Donnell"", 'get', 'let', 'alone', 'be', 'weekend', 'companion', 'Who', 'then', 'tougher', 'one', 'Do', 'might', 'Slade', 'can', 'not', 'rid', 'college', 'boy', 'watching', 'safety', 'impromptu', 'visit', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'time', 'no', 'longer', 'boy', 'who', 'steely', 'determination.Lieutenant', 'Colonel', 'Frank', 'Slade', 'given', 'up', 'life', 'lost', 'military', 'career', 'once', 'promising', 'lost', 'sight', 'machismo', 'pranks', 'tossing', 'grenades', 'lost', 'affection', 'support', 'family', 'impossible', 'manner', 'save', 'daughter', 'who', 'clenched', 'teeth', 'never', 'been', 'able', 'hold', 'woman', 'woman', 'paid', 'services', 'pleasure', 'indeed', 'only', 'ever', 'had', 'scent', 'woman', 'woman', 'body', 'purchased', 'heart', 'spirit', 'forever', 'elusive', 'man', 'far', 'more', 'courage', 'hold', 'what', 'required', 'escort', 'services', 'Slade', 'Slade', 'courage', 'limited', 'military', 'machismo', 'realms', 'none', 'when', 'challenge', 'emotional', 'courage.To', 'young', 'idealistic', 'companion', 'Charlie', 'everything', 'Slade', 'not', 'perhaps', 'was', 'long', 'ago', 'Slade', 'critical', 'moment', 'when', 'life', 'have', 'done', 'right', 'thing', 'did', 'feel', 'important', 'do', 'are', 'man', 'integrity', 'Charlie', 'Slade', 'are', 'not', 'bad', 'man', 'are', 'hiding', 'fear.The', 'impossible', 'becomes', 'possible', 'when', 'Charlie', 'idealism', 'Slade', 'moment', 'despair', 'Something', 'heroic', 'resides', 'Slade', 'When', 'Charlie', 'must', 'make', 'difficult', 'choice', 'harsh', 'test', 'personal', 'honor', 'Slade', 'side', 'resulting', 'speech', 'alone', 'price', 'film.Once', 'Slade', 'integrity', 'yes', 'was', 'fear', 'surface', 'scent', 'woman', 'long', 'last', 'woman', 'breakthrough', 'always', 'kind', 'dominoe', 'effect', 'even', 'reality.Pacino', 'performance', 'film', 'exemplary', ""O'Donnell"", 'too', 'first', 'class', 'convincing', 'portrayal', 'youth', 'bumbling', 'innocence', 'yet', 'uncorrupted', 'ideals']",N/A
