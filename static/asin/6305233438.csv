455328,A1TONI9A0YFOD6,6305233438,Bruce Rux,"[6, 6]","Faithful third film adaptation of Bram Stoker's The Jewel Of Seven Stars (following Blood From the Mummy's Tomb and The Awakening) doesn't deliver all it promises, but it delivers enough to be worth watching.Archaeologist Lloyd Bochner is attacked in his locked study, and has left very specific instructions about how he is to be guarded while unconscious - the attack plainly did not surprise him too much, and police inspector Mark Lindsey Chapman wants to know why. Chapman thinks Bochner's estranged daughter, Amy Locane, had something to do with it. His suspicions aren't helped any when other people in the household begin suffering accidents, and Locane always just happens to be the only one nearby.Locane and her Egyptology student boyfriend seek out Bochner's old colleague Louis Gosset, Jr., presently an outpatient at the local asylum. Gosset was with Bochner when he made his most stupendous find in Egypt, the tomb of Tara, a sorceress queen so feared that her name was erased from history. He knows - as does Bochner - that the attack was somehow engineered by Tara's ancient black magic, and that there's more where that came from...The production on this movie is really quite handsome. It's dark and rich and colorful, with a wonderfully atmospheric music score. The sets and set pieces seem more authentic than usual for this kind of film. The performances range from good to adequate. The script is actually pretty decent, and the style refreshingly low-key (though there are a couple of splashy special-effects lapses). It's rather slow, and stretches credibility a bit, but you have to expect that in a movie with dusty mummies walking around strangling people - and the mummy is pretty creepy, at that.All three versions of this story are pretty good. This isn't the best, but it's imminently watchable and attractively packaged throughout.",3,Third Time's (Almost) A Charm,1024099200,"06 15, 2002",2002,1864,"['Faithful', 'third', 'film', 'adaptation', 'Bram', 'Stoker', 'Jewel', 'Seven', 'Stars', 'following', 'Blood', 'Mummy', 'Tomb', 'Awakening', ""n't"", 'deliver', 'enough', 'be', 'worth', 'watching.Archaeologist', 'Lloyd', 'Bochner', 'attacked', 'locked', 'study', 'left', 'very', 'specific', 'instructions', 'how', 'be', 'guarded', 'unconscious', 'attack', 'plainly', 'did', 'not', 'surprise', 'too', 'much', 'police', 'inspector', 'Mark', 'Lindsey', 'Chapman', 'know', 'why', 'Chapman', 'Bochner', 'estranged', 'daughter', 'Amy', 'Locane', 'had', 'something', 'do', 'suspicions', 'are', ""n't"", 'helped', 'when', 'other', 'people', 'household', 'begin', 'suffering', 'accidents', 'Locane', 'always', 'just', 'be', 'only', 'one', 'nearby.Locane', 'Egyptology', 'student', 'boyfriend', 'seek', 'out', 'Bochner', 'old', 'colleague', 'Louis', 'Gosset', 'Jr.', 'presently', 'outpatient', 'local', 'asylum', 'Gosset', 'was', 'Bochner', 'when', 'made', 'most', 'stupendous', 'find', 'Egypt', 'tomb', 'Tara', 'sorceress', 'queen', 'so', 'feared', 'name', 'was', 'erased', 'history', 'Bochner', 'attack', 'was', 'somehow', 'engineered', 'Tara', 'ancient', 'black', 'magic', 'more', 'where', 'came', 'production', 'movie', 'really', 'quite', 'handsome', 'dark', 'rich', 'colorful', 'wonderfully', 'atmospheric', 'music', 'score', 'sets', 'set', 'pieces', 'seem', 'more', 'authentic', 'usual', 'kind', 'film', 'performances', 'range', 'good', 'adequate', 'script', 'actually', 'pretty', 'decent', 'style', 'refreshingly', 'low-key', 'are', 'couple', 'splashy', 'special-effects', 'lapses', 'rather', 'slow', 'stretches', 'credibility', 'bit', 'have', 'expect', 'movie', 'dusty', 'mummies', 'walking', 'strangling', 'people', 'mummy', 'pretty', 'creepy', 'that.All', 'three', 'versions', 'story', 'are', 'pretty', 'good', ""n't"", 'best', 'imminently', 'watchable', 'attractively', 'packaged']",N/A
455329,A3QIW6ULPIPM2V,6305233438,Chip Kaufmann,"[2, 2]","After seeing the average rating for this film (2 stars) I wasn't expecting much but having been in a Mummy movie mode lately (I just finished THE MUMMY LIVES w/ the recently departed Tony Curtis), I decided to give it a try. I guessed from the title that this was a remake of one of my favorite Bram Stoker novels (THE JEWEL OF SEVEN STARS) which is essentially the source of all Mummy movies and in particular, Hammer's 1971 BLOOD FROM THE MUMMY'S TOMB and Mike Newell's 1980 film THE AWAKENING with Charlton Heston. This fact seemed to have escaped most of the reviewers who thought it was a ripoff of Stephen Sommer's THE MUMMY with Brendan Fraser although it was made 2 years earlier. Therein lies the problem. A literary adaptation is not going to please a mainstream horror audience for whom actions speak louder than words.Of the 4 versions of Stoker's novel (there's also a 1970 made-for-TV movie), this one is the most faithful even retaining the original characters' names and sticking to the original storyline. The one exception, and it's a major one, is to set the film in present day (1997) California rather than Victorian England. This makes the dialogue seem archaic and overly theatrical and the same can be said for the performances. Louis Gossett Jr, who is clearly enjoying himself, gives a wonderfully OTT performance as do a few of the others which is what you have to do with this material. Well made on a tight budget with a flamboyant resurrection scene. While not quite in the same league as the other two mentioned films, my number one expectation for a grade B movie like this is that it entertain me and that it did.",3,Much Better Than I Expected.,1285891200,"10 1, 2010",2010,1646,"['seeing', 'average', 'rating', 'film', '2', 'stars', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'much', 'having', 'been', 'Mummy', 'movie', 'mode', 'lately', 'just', 'finished', 'THE', 'MUMMY', 'LIVES', 'w/', 'recently', 'departed', 'Tony', 'Curtis', 'decided', 'give', 'try', 'guessed', 'title', 'was', 'remake', 'one', 'favorite', 'Bram', 'Stoker', 'novels', 'THE', 'JEWEL', 'OF', 'SEVEN', 'STARS', 'essentially', 'source', 'Mummy', 'movies', 'particular', 'Hammer', '1971', 'BLOOD', 'FROM', 'THE', 'MUMMY', 'TOMB', 'Mike', 'Newell', '1980', 'film', 'THE', 'AWAKENING', 'Charlton', 'Heston', 'fact', 'seemed', 'have', 'escaped', 'most', 'reviewers', 'who', 'thought', 'was', 'ripoff', 'Stephen', 'Sommer', 'THE', 'MUMMY', 'Brendan', 'Fraser', 'was', 'made', '2', 'years', 'earlier', 'Therein', 'problem', 'literary', 'adaptation', 'not', 'going', 'please', 'mainstream', 'horror', 'audience', 'whom', 'actions', 'speak', 'louder', 'words.Of', '4', 'versions', 'Stoker', 'novel', 'also', '1970', 'made-for-TV', 'movie', 'one', 'most', 'faithful', 'even', 'retaining', 'original', 'characters', 'names', 'sticking', 'original', 'storyline', 'one', 'exception', 'major', 'one', 'set', 'film', 'present', 'day', '1997', 'California', 'rather', 'Victorian', 'England', 'dialogue', 'seem', 'archaic', 'overly', 'theatrical', 'same', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'performances', 'Louis', 'Gossett', 'Jr', 'who', 'clearly', 'enjoying', 'wonderfully', 'OTT', 'performance', 'do', 'few', 'others', 'what', 'have', 'do', 'material', 'Well', 'made', 'tight', 'budget', 'flamboyant', 'resurrection', 'scene', 'not', 'quite', 'same', 'league', 'other', 'two', 'mentioned', 'films', 'number', 'one', 'expectation', 'grade', 'B', 'movie', 'entertain', 'did']",N/A
