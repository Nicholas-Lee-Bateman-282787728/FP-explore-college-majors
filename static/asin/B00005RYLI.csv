The former happened first, and the latter never occurred, much to the disappointment of her fans. At least in the majority of the time, they can see her white panties through her somewhat skimpy yet tight velvet dress. It's no wonder why she was picked up for this film, fresh off from her performance in Straw Dogs. Too much connection going on here. Lost in that confusion, Fright is a lot of screaming, fancy camera work, and foreboding of what the audience had anticipated all along. Let me just get the gist of the film made by TCM: ""A baby sitter and her young charge are terrorized by an escaped mental patient."" It sounds like pre-Halloween but only worse. Speaking of ineptitude, how about these cops? Why not just distract the guy and go in the back to sneak in? Or why not the babysitter just leave through the front door by undoing the locks one at a time while the lunatic is peering through the window? Worst of all, why would she have a gun? Why would a cop give her a gun? What for? Let the pros do the work. All in all, Fright is a disappointment no matter which way you look at it.",2,Another British Horror Snore.,1342310400,"07 15, 2012",2012,1230,"['Viewed', '7/12Rate', '37/12', 'put', 'nicely', 'Fright', 'constant', 'race', 'Brian', 'losing', 'mind', 'Susan', 'George', 'getting', 'naked', 'former', 'happened', 'first', 'latter', 'never', 'occurred', 'much', 'disappointment', 'fans', 'least', 'majority', 'time', 'can', 'see', 'white', 'panties', 'somewhat', 'skimpy', 'yet', 'tight', 'velvet', 'dress', 'wonder', 'why', 'was', 'picked', 'up', 'film', 'fresh', 'off', 'performance', 'Straw', 'Dogs', 'Too', 'much', 'connection', 'going', 'here', 'Lost', 'confusion', 'Fright', 'lot', 'screaming', 'fancy', 'camera', 'work', 'foreboding', 'what', 'audience', 'had', 'anticipated', 'all', 'along', 'Let', 'just', 'get', 'gist', 'film', 'made', 'TCM', 'baby', 'sitter', 'young', 'charge', 'are', 'terrorized', 'escaped', 'mental', 'patient', 'pre-Halloween', 'only', 'worse', 'Speaking', 'ineptitude', 'how', 'cops', 'Why', 'not', 'just', 'distract', 'guy', 'go', 'back', 'sneak', 'why', 'not', 'babysitter', 'just', 'leave', 'front', 'door', 'undoing', 'locks', 'one', 'time', 'lunatic', 'peering', 'window', 'Worst', 'why', 'would', 'have', 'gun', 'Why', 'would', 'cop', 'give', 'gun', 'What', 'Let', 'pros', 'do', 'work', 'Fright', 'disappointment', 'matter', 'way', 'look']",N/A

That's what it says on the back of the DVD case...after seeing the film, I find the veracity of that statement to be genuinely false.  The film does not stand alone, or even out, among the myriad of other films within the genre, ultimately blending inconspicuously into the pack.  Based on a story written by Tudor Gates, whom had two of his other stories translated to film the same year in Lust for a Vampire and Twins of Evil, Fright was directed by Peter Collinson, who previously directed The Italian Job (1969).  The film stars two obvious victims of the British dental system in Susan George (Straw Dogs) and Ian Bannen (Flight of the Phoenix).  Also appearing are Honor Blackman (Goldfinger), George Cole (The Vampire Lovers), John Gregson (The Lavender Hill Mob), and Dennis Waterman (Scars of Dracula).As the movie begins, we see a pretty young woman named Amanda (George) arriving at a large and spooky house (Scooby Doo, where are you?!), greeted suspiciously by Helen (Blackman).  Amanda has been hired to baby sit while Helen and her husband Jim (Gregson) have a night out on the town (Jim's due for an oil change, I think).  After some pleasantries (and booze...would you normally offer the babysitter liquor before you leave?  I mean, you can't really keep them away from the stuff once you're gone, but offering it up front kinda opens the door), the couple leave, and Amanda is left alone with the sleeping tot, or so she thinks.  She begins hearing noises and seeing faces at various windows, thus causing much freaking out.  Her amorous boyfriend Chris (Waterman) arrives, and she quickly blames him as she thinks he was the one at the window earlier trying to scare her (it wasn't).  After numerous attempts to get his freak on, Amanda finally kicks him out, but probably wishes she hadn't as a strange figure (Bannen) finds his way into the house and turns a cushy babysitting gig into a night of terror as the stranger is in fact an escaped homicidal maniac (is there any other kind?) with depraved plans of his own.Fright is listed as a horror, but it tends to lean more towards being a suspenseful thriller (it's rarely suspenseful and hardly thrilling).  I had read where someone thought the makers of this film (produced in England) suffered greatly from extremely strict British censorship laws imposed on cinematic sex and violence effectively watered down the proceedings from what they could have been, had the film been produced, say, in the United States.  This may be partly true, but a crafty director would have found a way around such impositions, in my opinion.  The movie is all right, but pretty much forgettable as I found myself becoming increasingly bored.  Most of it takes place within the house, and I would have liked to seen more of it used, rather than just a few rooms.  From the outside, it looked large and expansive, so I was expecting more with regards to the interior shots, than I got.  I will say many of the elements are present, and put together with the craftsmanship of someone who knows his business (lighting, framing shots, etc.), but there's something missing, a sense of passion for the genre, I think...really good directors manage to infuse a bit of themselves within their films, and it generally shows, but I didn't get that here.  I've never really thought of Susan George as an especially talented actress, and she didn't change my opinion here with her constant overacting (Amanda was suffered from bouts of extreme hysteria, which can be quite painful, not to the victim, but to those forced to watch).  I think the character required a subtle touch, one not possessed by George.  I thought Ms. Blackman did well, but then I suppose maybe I'm a little biased, as she's very easy on the eyes.  Bannen's (who I generally like) character seemed entirely paper-thin, hardly presenting the threat we're lead to believe he is...and here is the problem...how can a movie like this be expected to work when the antagonist is does very little to frighten the audience?  I will concede (just a little) that given the film was released in 1971, maybe it was a bit scarier then, but today's audiences probably won't think so (Robert Wise's The Haunting, an English production, released in 1963 still has the power to scare, despite its' age or restrictive elements of its' originating country...go check it out)...there are spots of shimmering originality within the story, but those were mired down as we're forced to slog through a great deal of seemingly useless filler.  One thing that really annoyed me within this film, and is a common element in many horror type films is the quickness and ease to which the antagonist was able to get around, appearing in one place, and then, if by magical, appearing somewhere else.  It's doesn't happen often in this film, but a few times, and given the fact that most of the movie is actually put together well, it tended to stand out.  At the end of the day, this is a film I'd expect to see on the Lifetime channel, as it more akin to a `woman in distress' film rather than a chilling, spooky horror movie.  If you're looking for something more, I'd suggest Black Christmas (1974) or When a Stranger Calls (1979), both being much more fun.The widescreen print (1:66:1) provided by Anchor Bay looks really good and very clear (from British vault elements, no less), but I thought the audio a bit soft, even muddled, at times.  Special features include an original theatrical trailer, and a detailed biography of the director Peter Collinson.  Also included is a nice reproduction of a poster for the film on a card inside the DVD case, the flipside displaying the chapter stops.Cookieman108",3,All the boys want Susan George...even the

A college student Amanda (Susan George) comes to the Lloyd residence to babysit there son. It seems the Lloyd's are going out for a celebration dinner. What Amanda thinks is an anniversary for the couple is really to celebrate Mrs. Lloyd's(Honor Blackman) devorce. It seems that Mrs. Lloyd is really Mrs. Helston and Mr. Lloyd (George Cole) is just the boyfriend,and her real husband is locked up in a mental institution for trying to kill her and the baby. So in typical horror movie fashionAmanda here's strange noises i.e. pipes rattling,clothes lines blowing in the wind etc. Her boyfriend is outside at one point trying to scare her. Everything's pretty much by the numbers for the first half of the movie,but when the baby's father(Ian Bannen) finally gets into the house He takes Amanda and the baby hostage and  Amanda has to fight to save herself and the baby and you really get the feeling that this guy is truely unstable and capable of harm. All in all a very good psychological thriller. I know that I said that this is pretty much a by the numbers thriller at the beginning,but keep in mind that this movie was made in 1971 before Halloween and When a Strange Calls which this film is reminescent of.

680717,A2ASIT0JYIGHTA,B00005RYLI,William,"[10, 10]","FRIGHT is a British film that probably scared viewers back in 1971, but standards have changed and viewers expect more. FRIGHT is about a young lady (Susan George) who is babysitting for a mother and her boyfriend while they are out for dinner.  Problem is, the mother's ex husband has escaped from an asylum and has arrived to seek revenge on whoever is in the house.  His motif is not explained, safe to assume it is because he is a fruit loop.What I liked about FRIGHT is that there are some genuine creepy scenes in the beginning. For example when Susan George is in the kitchen and there is someone out in the courtyard, but she doesn't know this. Allyou want is for her to lock that door, and eventually she does.  There are a couple more creepy scenes to follow.However, after that the film slowly went downhill.  The bad plot (or lack of) didn't help matters, nor did the dragging of the film.I think it is still worth seeing just to see a British attempt at horror/thriller.  If anything, you will get a good laugh or two over the acting of the maniac.
