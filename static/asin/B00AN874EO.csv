This movie is no exception.  I don't review all the bad movies I watch.  I feel I've suffered enough by viewing them.  Let alone, re-living the experience in a review.  I kept thinking the film maker had a choice between taking the change in his pocket and buying a pack of gum or making a movie.  I could've gone for a stick of gum.  Few locations added to the monotony of the dialog.  And be prepared.  Bad dialog is all you'll get from this film.  My moment of disappointment peaked when two of the characters were going into town to get supplies.  You see them fight over taking a gun.  Then the action cuts back to them in the compound and leaves you wondering, &#34;When did they go to town?
