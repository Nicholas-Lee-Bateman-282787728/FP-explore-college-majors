1000914,A2IY9M330NKBW6,B000GB5M2Y,Eric Sanberg,"[0, 0]","This isn't bad. It isn't good. It just isn't much of anything. When you look at the director Malone's history, there's really nothing that sticks out as being exceptional and this is more of the same.Here's the scoop. A young girl who is an outsider at school (a point which seems to have no baring on the story) is kidnapped, drugged and wakes up in a basement. She finds she has a male roommate who is hanging from a noose. She rescues him and the two set out to try and escape. She soon realizes he's integral to the problem in that mom and dad need to kill 12 girls to bring sonny permanently back to life after an accidental drowning. She's the 12th victim.This is OK. Laurie Petty does a fine job as the mom. I didn't much care for dad's performance and the two young folk do a decent job in their rolls. The creature that sonny transforms into is genuinely creepy and is the highlight of the proceedings. Somehow this all seemed too familiar and the ending was just so-so. The camerawork, editing, sound and directing aren't bad, but they don't aspire to any new heights.At a merciful 55 minutes long it won't tax your patience but don't approach this as being anything more than a mild diversion.",3,Not Much of Anything,1304294400,"05 2, 2011",2011,1204,"[""n't"", 'bad', ""n't"", 'good', 'just', ""n't"", 'much', 'anything', 'When', 'look', 'director', 'Malone', 'history', 'really', 'nothing', 'out', 'being', 'exceptional', 'more', 'same.Here', 'scoop', 'young', 'girl', 'who', 'outsider', 'school', 'point', 'have', 'baring', 'story', 'kidnapped', 'drugged', 'up', 'basement', 'male', 'roommate', 'who', 'hanging', 'noose', 'two', 'set', 'out', 'try', 'escape', 'soon', 'integral', 'problem', 'mom', 'dad', 'need', 'kill', '12', 'girls', 'bring', 'sonny', 'permanently', 'back', 'life', 'accidental', 'drowning', '12th', 'victim.This', 'OK.', 'Laurie', 'Petty', 'fine', 'job', 'mom', 'did', ""n't"", 'much', 'care', 'dad', 'performance', 'two', 'young', 'folk', 'do', 'decent', 'job', 'rolls', 'creature', 'sonny', 'transforms', 'genuinely', 'creepy', 'highlight', 'proceedings', 'Somehow', 'seemed', 'too', 'familiar', 'ending', 'was', 'just', 'so-so', 'camerawork', 'editing', 'sound', 'directing', 'are', ""n't"", 'bad', 'do', ""n't"", 'aspire', 'new', 'heights.At', 'merciful', '55', 'minutes', 'long', 'wo', ""n't"", 'tax', 'patience', 'do', ""n't"", 'approach', 'being', 'anything', 'more', 'mild', 'diversion']",N/A
1000915,A1N7YA81ZI4KAF,B000GB5M2Y,"E. Valero ""Eterno""","[0, 0]","Two grieving parents (Lori Petty and William Samples) make a pact with the Devil so their deceased son Johnny (Jesse Haddock), can be brought back to life. The process involves sacrificing 12 young virgins to a vicious boy-beast (see DVD front cover) who feasts upon their young, innocent flesh. The latest victim, a troubled loner named Tara (Lindsay Pulsipher), ends up bonding with the tormented soul in the basement and tries to unravel the mystery before she too falls victim to the fair haired child.This entry in the ""Masters of Horror"" series was directed by William Malone who has surpassed expectations by delivering an entertaining episode despite its flaws. The film is visually haunting but some of the performances, with the exception of the young male protagonist (Haddock) fall flat. The young female lead (Pulsipher) was unconvincing. Physically speaking, she was too pretty to be believable as an outcast teenage freakazoid who everyone likes to pick on and her performance was a bit uneven. At times, she was good, other times she was clearly struggling to convey emotion but I will give her credit for trying. Visually, this film is interesting and out of all the episodes of Season 1, this one stands out over the others for its visual style and atmosphere. There are flashback scenes in vivid black and white and some scenes are set to classical music (the parents are accomplished musicians) which adds a dream like tone to the piece. The demon child is also a sight to behold (again, see DVD front cover). Too bad it doesn't get much screen time. I am a big fan of the ""less is more"" mentality especially in horror films (although I do love a great gore-fest as is evidenced by my other reviews). But sometimes the suspense, atmosphere, plot, build-up etc are suffice to make a film scary without resorting to buckets of blood, Carpenter's ""Halloween"" is one example, Bob Clark's ""Black Christmas"" is another. The ""Masters of Horror"" series has not taken that approach since gratuitous nudity and explicit gore are plentiful throughout. This episode is an exception and while I give the director credit for trying to create an atmospheric and surrealistic horror tale, a little more was needed to make this memorable. I was yearning for more shots of the nasty creature. After all, it looks so good in the cover art and photo stills yet the actual film only offers a preview. The climax is a bit disappointing and it was hard to believe that this tormented young man who obviously had guilt issues would have done what he did to appease and protect the young attractive stranger in his basement.Overall though, ""The Fair Haired Child"" is consistent. It differs from the others as this installment is devoid of purposeless nudity and gore galore but the film's visual flair will compensate for that as well as the lack of genuine scares and that lovable, huggable, charmer gracing the cover art is worthy of the 3.5 stars I am awarding it.

About a outcast girl (Tara) at college that gets abducted, thrown into a basement by some wacko satanic parents that have lost their son to fulfill an ancient pact with the forces of darkness to  bring their son back to mortal life.  It takes 12 sacrifices one for each year on the sons birthday and this girl (Tara) is the last.  However she develops a relationship with the boy that is trying to b e resurrected and the parents plan goes awry, as he turns out to be a better negotiator with the powers of darkness than his parents were.I thought this movie did quite well being only an hour in length.  The movie did appear pretty dark at times and it was hard to make out what was happening. Though I suppose that would be true to story being most of the movie takes place in a dark basement, so that part cant really be faulted.I did think that another girl should have been casted, or the actress that was casted needed more makeup to appear ""Not so pretty"", because it did not lend well to the ""Outcast girl that no one really liked"" type of look, because she was indeed pretty and probably would not have been the outcast girl in real life.

Harris ""Film aficionado""","[14, 16]","I'm not quite sure that ""House on Haunted Hill"" and ""FeardotCom"" qualified William Malone to be called a Master of Horror in the Showtime anthology series--but we'll have that debate later.  Considering the uneven quality of many of the episodes, the real surprise is that Malone surpasses many of the more acclaimed directors.  ""The Fair-Haired Child"" is definitely a solid, if not great, episode in the infuriatingly inconsistent ""Masters of Horror.""  In fact, ""Child"" (considering his resume) might be Malone's most effective work yet.The tale begins with the abduction of a young girl.  Trapped by a couple, led by a gloriously deranged Lori Petty, she is locked in their basement with another child.  Forming a tentative friendship with the mute boy, she eventually learns that they will be involved in some sort of ritual to bring the couple's deceased child back to life.  Let's just say that they made a pact with the devil that involves child sacrifice and a rather unpleasant beastie.The mood and atmosphere of ""Child"" are genuinely creepy, the performances good, and the effects are nice. The spooky ambiance and brisk pace distinguish this tale from some of the others.  This certainly isn't a groundbreaking work, though.  You've seen elements of this story in many other films.  However, it is put together with confidence and competence.  I enjoyed ""The Fair-Haired Child,"" and would rate it at 3 1/2 star if possible.

I watch LOTS of horror movies, read horror books, research hauntings, and even read horror comics. It takes a lot to impress me because 99 times out of 100, I've seen it before. The Fair Haired Child blew my socks off.Not only is this movie artfully crafted and skillfully directed, the special effects are killer. Some scenes I immediately watched again, just to catch every second of the chilling graphics. The storyline is demented, twisted, and oh so evil. The acting also doesn't disappoint in the least (who doesn't love Lori Petty?) The monster of the film is grotesque and Lovecraftian. Everything here is perfection. Normally with a running time of just under an hour -in this case, 55 minutes- you might feel cheated. However, in this case, everything about the movie is so spot on you don't mind the short time.

1000925,A3V2THQU2RQ1AG,B000GB5M2Y,Molly C.,"[1, 1]","Distraught father Anton and mother Judith (played by Lori Petty of Tank Girl fame) try to resurrect their dead son by sacrificing a young girl to a demon.The film opens with young Tara being teased in school, riding her bike home, then getting kidnapped by a man in a van. I could only imagine the fears this scene would conjure up in any parent. After Tara wakes up, she tries to call her mom for help explaining that she has been drugged, kidnapped, and hospitalized in another state to which her mom casually replies, ""Can I call you back later?"" Malone directs a surprisingly restrained tale of suffering considering his previous outings included, which was oddly gratuitous and devoid of meaning. Fair-Haired Child is a touching story of a mother so heartbroken she is pushed to desperate lengths, a rebellious teen that betrays the ones that love him, and a kidnapped girl that no one notices is missing. The story is a simple one with a nice twist ending and pleasantly reminded me of the old Twilight Zone series.The mood and atmosphere are great with many scenes set to classical music. There are black & white scenes that represent the dark doings of the parents and the little blonde girl looking up from the bloody bathtub through the hole in the basement looks like a lost Alice after falling through the rabbit hole.On a side note, I thought it a curious gesture to add Malone to the list of ""Masters of Horror"". He did a few low budget creature flicks, followed by the good House on Haunted Hill remake, which was followed by the very bad. I think this TV episode is one of the highlights of his resume now. Another interesting thing I noticed is that while many of the directors chose to push the limits in their episodes, this one seemed tame in comparison and yet was still quite good. Unfortunately, it did not get much attention, as it was not controversial like many of the others.The 55 minute TV show is presented with a 1.77:1 ratio aspect, Dolby Digital 5.1, and Surround Sound 2.0. The creature looked awesome with the stand out image being the aftermath of Tara after confronting the Fair-Haired Child.Favorite Quote: Anton, ""Nietzsche said anything done out of love is beyond good and evil. We're not evil. I still love you Judith."" DVD Extras: Interviews with Director & Cast, Commentary, Behind-the-Scenes, Trailers, Stills, Malone's Bio, and the Screenplay on DVD-ROM.Bottom Line: Good tale rooted in family values and the price of love. Minimal gore and scares, but well told and acted nonetheless.Rating: 7/10by Molly Celaschi",3,Good tale rooted in family values and the price of love,1170115200,"01 30, 2007",2007,2559,"['Distraught', 'Anton', 'mother', 'Judith', 'played', 'Lori', 'Petty', 'Tank', 'Girl', 'fame', 'try', 'resurrect', 'dead', 'son', 'sacrificing', 'young', 'girl', 'demon.The', 'film', 'young', 'Tara', 'being', 'teased', 'school', 'riding', 'bike', 'home', 'then', 'getting', 'kidnapped', 'man', 'van', 'could', 'only', 'imagine', 'fears', 'scene', 'would', 'conjure', 'up', 'parent', 'Tara', 'wakes', 'up', 'call', 'mom', 'help', 'explaining', 'been', 'drugged', 'kidnapped', 'hospitalized', 'state', 'mom', 'casually', 'Can', 'call', 'back', 'later', 'Malone', 'surprisingly', 'restrained', 'tale', 'suffering', 'considering', 'previous', 'outings', 'included', 'was', 'oddly', 'gratuitous', 'devoid', 'meaning', 'Fair-Haired', 'Child', 'touching', 'story', 'mother', 'so', 'heartbroken', 'pushed', 'desperate', 'lengths', 'rebellious', 'teen', 'ones', 'love', 'kidnapped', 'girl', 'one', 'missing', 'story', 'simple', 'one', 'nice', 'twist', 'ending', 'pleasantly', 'reminded', 'old', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'series.The', 'mood', 'atmosphere', 'are', 'great', 'many', 'scenes', 'set', 'classical', 'music', 'are', 'black', 'white', 'scenes', 'represent', 'dark', 'doings', 'parents', 'little', 'blonde', 'girl', 'looking', 'up', 'bloody', 'hole', 'basement', 'lost', 'Alice', 'falling', 'rabbit', 'side', 'note', 'thought', 'curious', 'gesture', 'add', 'Malone', 'list', 'Masters', 'Horror', 'did', 'few', 'low', 'budget', 'creature', 'flicks', 'followed', 'good', 'House', 'Haunted', 'Hill', 'remake', 'was', 'followed', 'very', 'bad', 'think', 'TV', 'episode', 'one', 'highlights', 'resume', 'now', 'interesting', 'thing', 'noticed', 'many', 'directors', 'chose', 'push', 'limits', 'episodes', 'one', 'seemed', 'tame', 'comparison', 'yet', 'was', 'still', 'quite', 'good', 'Unfortunately', 'did', 'not', 'get', 'much', 'attention', 'was', 'not', 'controversial', 'many', 'others.The', '55', 'minute', 'TV', 'show', 'presented', '1.77:1', 'ratio', 'aspect', 'Dolby', 'Digital', '5.1', 'Surround', 'Sound', '2.0', 'creature', 'looked', 'awesome', 'stand', 'out', 'image', 'being', 'aftermath', 'Tara', 'confronting', 'Fair-Haired', 'Child.Favorite', 'Quote', 'Anton', 'Nietzsche', 'said', 'anything', 'done', 'love', 'good', 'evil', ""'re"", 'not', 'evil', 'still', 'love', 'Judith', 'DVD', 'Extras', 'Interviews', 'Director', 'Cast', 'Commentary', 'Behind-the-Scenes', 'Trailers', 'Stills', 'Malone', 'Bio', 'Screenplay', 'DVD-ROM.Bottom', 'Line', 'Good', 'tale', 'rooted', 'family', 'values', 'price', 'love', 'Minimal', 'gore', 'scares', 'well', 'told', 'acted', 'nonetheless.Rating', '7/10by', 'Molly', 'Celaschi']",N/A

His entry into the first season of Masters of Horror, Fair Haired Child, contains some eerie atmosphere and some genuine moments of suspense, but there isn't a whole lot else to distinguish it among the series' best episodes.  Lindsay Pulsipher stars as a troubled teen who is kidnapped by a couple (Lori Petty and William Samples) who have been sacrificing kids to bring their dead son (Jesse Haddock) back to life.  There's some good gore effects, effective scares, and a creepy looking monster to boot; but where Fair Haired Child fails is with the uber-campy black & white flashback sequences, which are just more laughable than anything else.

1000930,A3UA046AA3DXFD,B000GB5M2Y,Sid the Elf,"[0, 1]","Masters of Horror was a show released through Showtime in which some of the best known directors and writers in the horror industry conjure up 1 hour stories similar to a Tales From the Crypt style. This format is right up out alley. We loved Tales From the Crypt and other short tv series and hoped this anthology would be on the same page. Unfortunately it's not in any sense. In two 13 episode seasons there is about 2 good efforts, the rest are complete garbage which makes sense since the show was cancelled after it's second year. So out of 26 episodes there are only 2-3 worth watching. Luckily Fair Haired Child was one of the select few and turned out to be a pretty creepy effort. What drew us to try this one out was the creepy looking face on the cover (yeah we fell for the cover again). With a mug like that this creature had to be worth checking out especially if it's under an hour long.The short starts with outcast teenager Tara and she sits through another painful day of school. Being shunned by everyone she hops on her bike to head home when she gets plowed down by a van. It was really fake looking so there were a couple laughs. While on the ground she is dragged into the back of the van where she's drugged and passes out. When she awakes she is sitting in a room with a nurse waiting. She tells Tara she is in a hosiptal in Vermont, far from her home in Virginia. Tara starts to freak out and gets up to call her mom who has no interest in picking her up. Seems the mother wants nothing to do with her daughter and gives her the brush off so she can get back to her nap. Parent of the year! Now that Tara is abandoned the nurse tries to ease her mind then starts asking her questions in regards to her health. Finally she asks if she's a virgin, which she is, forcing Tara to wonder what kind of hospital this is. Turns out it's no hospital and the woman isn't a nurse. Tara has been kidnapped by a couple who refuse to let her leave. They grab her by hands and feet and chuck her into the dark basement where the door is locked behind her.Once in the basement she sees a kids hanging from the ceiling but is still alive. She rushes over and helps him down but he hasn't enough energy to talk. She tries to find out why he's here and all he can down is warn her by writing on the wall his name is Johnny and she needs to hide quick. She isn't sure why until Johhny starts morphing into the creature you see on the cover. This thing is really creepy looking so kudos to whoever did the makeup. It walks around all quick and eratic looking to eat Tara. She manages to escape to a part of the basement just in time for the creature to turn back into Johhny. She approaches him and asks what his deal is and why he turns into this thing. He informs her that he died years ago and the parents made a pack with the devil that they would sacrifice 12 virgins to the creature he becomes in order to bring him back. Tara happens to be the final sacrifice (Rowsdower!) in order to bring him back to life, but Johhny doesn't want it to heppen. He is harmless and doesn't want to kill but the creature inside takes over. After all the screams end the parents unlock the basement and retrieve their son. Now that the sacrifices have been complete he is a normal boy again. The family is sitting upstairs where Johhny just stares at the window forcing his mother to ask what he's doing and he responds; waiting. He tells them he had made a pact with the devil that instead of sacrificing the girl he'd prefer his parents be the sacrifice and the creature bursts through the window to rip apart the parents. Johhny now is back to a normal boy and Tara is unharmed. The ending is turned out corny since Johhny and Tara now seem like a couple and will live there lives together in the secluded home. Could've wrapped it up a bit cooler then that but whatever.Overall this Masters of Horror was a pretty good effort. The atmosphere and creature were extremely creepy and represented the intruguing cover well. This wasn't one of those you were tricked into by a great looking cover, it actually delivered. So if you are interested in checking out any of the Masters of Horror series then make Fair Haired Child one of your only choices.
