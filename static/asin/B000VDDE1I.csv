1100959,A103KNDW8GN92L,B000VDDE1I,David Hugaert,"[0, 0]","""Gomer Pyle - The Third Season"" provides the viewer with many a laugh this season. Gomer finds himself on a wild goose chase in the episode ""Follow That Car"", where Gomer loses a ham radio. Gomer & Sgt. Carter eventually track it down, nearly landing in trouble with two criminals who are on the lam. In Wither The Weather"", Gomer's lucky foot can predict the weather. Gomer's so sure of his own predictions, that Sgt. Carter becomes suspicious. When Carter finally is certain about Gomer's predictions, he agrees to have an important military ceremony held outdoors. It just goes to show Gomer can be wrong! Gomer convinces a couple to reopen their Chinese restaurant in ""You Bet Your Won Ton"", & Gomer has a near-accident, which prompts a shyster attorney to take Gomer's case in ""Sue The Pants Off 'Em"". Sgt. Carter does his best to discourage Gomer into signing up for another tour of duty in the episode ""To Re-enlist Or Not To Re-enlist"". In fact, Carter is certain Pyle won't re-enlist, that he's lined up both a job & a house for Gomer. Gomer has a series of bad dreams, thanks to a cheesy delight in ""Gomer, The Welsh Rarebit Fiend"". Sgt. Carter gets suspicious when he loses his wristwatch, ring & other items in ""The Crow Ganef"", & Gomer inadvertently recruits a criminal in ""Gomer, The Recruiter"" - featuring Rob Reiner in a guest-starring role. There are plenty of dramatic moments interspersed with the comedy in ""Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C. - The Third Season"".

In Season 2 at least 2 of Gomer's songs were cut. In Season 3 there are 2 episodes that require Gomer to sing and all those songs are included. Those are ""Love's Old Sweet Song"" where he sings to Lou-Ann Poovie and ""Sing A Song Of Papa"" where he sings for the gangster nightclub owner. However, there is one episode ""To Re-Enlist Or Not To Re-Enlist"" that is questionable. There is a scene with Sgt. Carter and Cpl. Boyle discussing Gomer's upcoming re-enlistment. Then, cut to Gomer and his fellow Marines in the barracks talking about whether they will all re-enlist. In this scene Gomer is holding a guitar. Did he just finish a song that was cut? This episode is also the shortest with a running time of 24:02.  I don't know why all of Gomer's other songs would be included and just one just song cut from this one episode, so I'm guessing this episode is also complete. But, can anybody confirm from memory or a bootleg DVD or VHS tape if this episode is complete?  Also, all 3 of the episodes that feature Lou-Ann Poovie have her songs included which strengthens the case for Season 3 being complete with no cut songs.",4,All Gomer's Songs Intact Except Maybe 1,1199923200,"01 10, 2008",2008,1276,"['just', 'finished', 'watching', '30', 'episodes', 'Gomer', 'Pyle', 'Season', '3', 'can', 'report', 'happily', 'episodes', 'one', 'possible', 'exception', 'are', 'complete', 'Season', '2', 'least', '2', 'Gomer', 'songs', 'were', 'cut', 'Season', '3', 'are', '2', 'episodes', 'require', 'Gomer', 'sing', 'songs', 'are', 'included', 'are', 'Love', 'Old', 'Sweet', 'Song', 'where', 'Lou-Ann', 'Poovie', 'Sing', 'Song', 'Papa', 'where', 'gangster', 'nightclub', 'owner', 'However', 'one', 'episode', 'Re-Enlist', 'Or', 'Not', 'Re-Enlist', 'questionable', 'scene', 'Sgt', 'Carter', 'Cpl', 'Boyle', 'discussing', 'Gomer', 'upcoming', 're-enlistment', 'Then', 'cut', 'Gomer', 'fellow', 'Marines', 'barracks', 'talking', 'will', 're-enlist', 'scene', 'Gomer', 'holding', 'guitar', 'Did', 'just', 'finish', 'song', 'was', 'cut', 'episode', 'also', 'shortest', 'running', 'time', '24:02', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'Gomer', 'other', 'songs', 'would', 'be', 'included', 'just', 'one', 'just', 'song', 'cut', 'one', 'episode', ""'m"", 'guessing', 'episode', 'also', 'complete', 'can', 'anybody', 'confirm', 'memory', 'bootleg', 'DVD', 'VHS', 'tape', 'episode', 'complete', 'Also', '3', 'episodes', 'feature', 'Lou-Ann', 'Poovie', 'have', 'songs', 'included', 'case', 'Season', '3', 'being', 'complete', 'cut', 'songs']",N/A
