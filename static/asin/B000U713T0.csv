This show was filmed in a small club, & makes U feel like U are right there in the room. These guys can really rock, Jim McCarty is one of the most underrated guitar players ever. I'm glad I bought the cd & now can watch em live.

I've seen Carmine and Tim with Vanilla Fudge the past few years, but I completely forgot how good Jim McCarty actually is. Too bad Rusty Day didn't live long enough to play with these guys. I thought the singer nailed down Rusty's parts pretty well though. The guy who plays Harp did a good job too.

The video quality is all washed out anytime the shot is anything but a close-up.  Audio quality is not much better than an OK bootleg.  My main disappointment is not hearing Tim's bass nice and crisp and clean.  The performance has some warts, but it was their first show together.  Jimmy Kunes comes across really well and fills Rusty's shoes quite admirably.  Ironically, the date of this show is the 24th anniversary of Rusty Day's death, but they don't mention that in their dedication to him.There is some rehearsal room footage with Jim and Tim playing through practice amps and Carmine keeping the beat on a padded chair!  I loved it!  Another bonus is three tracks from a different club performance under the heading ""Home Movies"" shot with a camcorder, and I swear the audio sounds better than the ""pro-shot"" stuff.  Maybe it's just me.It's now been over 4 years since this and the ""Cactus V"" CD came out, and it doesn't look like anything else new will be coming at this point, so if you love these guys, get both cuz this might be all there is.",4,Actually liked the extras better,1292457600,"12 16, 2010",2010,1106,"['Not', 'bad', 'show', 'be', 'sure', 'not', 'great', 'either', 'video', 'quality', 'washed', 'out', 'shot', 'anything', 'close-up', 'Audio', 'quality', 'not', 'much', 'better', 'OK', 'bootleg', 'main', 'disappointment', 'not', 'hearing', 'Tim', 'bass', 'nice', 'crisp', 'clean', 'performance', 'warts', 'was', 'first', 'show', 'together', 'Jimmy', 'Kunes', 'really', 'well', 'Rusty', 'shoes', 'quite', 'admirably', 'Ironically', 'date', 'show', '24th', 'anniversary', 'Rusty', 'Day', 'death', 'do', ""n't"", 'mention', 'dedication', 'him.There', 'rehearsal', 'room', 'footage', 'Jim', 'Tim', 'playing', 'practice', 'amps', 'Carmine', 'keeping', 'beat', 'padded', 'chair', 'loved', 'bonus', 'three', 'tracks', 'different', 'club', 'performance', 'heading', 'Home', 'Movies', 'shot', 'camcorder', 'swear', 'audio', 'better', 'pro-shot', 'stuff', 'just', 'me.It', 'now', 'been', '4', 'years', 'Cactus', 'V', 'CD', 'came', 'out', ""n't"", 'look', 'anything', 'else', 'new', 'will', 'be', 'coming', 'point', 'love', 'guys', 'get', 'cuz', 'might', 'be']",N/A

I agree some in the band could have used more rehearsing time - but all in all was interesting to view. My DVD also had the editing and sound issues. Not much in the way of extras.Cactus to me has always been about the guitar playing of Jim McCarty and he doesn't disappoint here. Carmine and Tim's reputation is well known (some good, some not so good) - but I was surprised at how much I missed the singing of Rusty Day. Jimmy tries hard - but I missed Rusty and it isn't quite the same without him.If you are into the nostalgia trip (and that's not terrible), this is a DVD to watch if you are a very big Cactus fan. Worth the price (to me) just to watch McCarty. If you are questioning where to spend your dollars on this band - get the first or second CD. Both are excellent (and the third isn't bad either).",3,Pleasant viewing - limited extras - of course no Rusty,1197590400,"12 14, 2007",2007,864,"['was', 'nice', 'DVD', 'watch', 'not', 'great', 'good', 'agree', 'band', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'more', 'rehearsing', 'time', 'was', 'interesting', 'view', 'DVD', 'also', 'had', 'editing', 'sound', 'issues', 'Not', 'much', 'way', 'extras.Cactus', 'always', 'been', 'guitar', 'playing', 'Jim', 'McCarty', ""n't"", 'disappoint', 'here', 'Carmine', 'Tim', 'reputation', 'well', 'known', 'good', 'not', 'so', 'good', 'was', 'surprised', 'how', 'much', 'missed', 'singing', 'Rusty', 'Day', 'Jimmy', 'hard', 'missed', 'Rusty', ""n't"", 'quite', 'same', 'him.If', 'are', 'nostalgia', 'trip', 'not', 'terrible', 'DVD', 'watch', 'are', 'very', 'big', 'Cactus', 'fan', 'price', 'just', 'watch', 'McCarty', 'are', 'questioning', 'where', 'spend', 'dollars', 'band', 'get', 'first', 'second', 'CD', 'are', 'excellent', 'third', ""n't"", 'bad', 'either']",N/A
