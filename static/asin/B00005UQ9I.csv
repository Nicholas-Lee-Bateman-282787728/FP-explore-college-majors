The idea of Snoop Dogg as an undead pimp with revenge on his mind (And his mind on revenge) sounded pretty interesting. However, the execution of this movie is very poor. The screen time in owned by a group of unknown young actors and Snoop only gets about 20 total minutes of screen time. I expected some great campy humor out of this movie, one of those movies that is ""so bad that it is good"" but it was just so bad that it hurt. The movie just lingered on and on, and even though it's only and hour and a half, I lost my patience half way through.

The main plot was boring (Hi, we're some dumb teenagers unaware of the horror that is to befall us) and I hated the actors, but the whole ""Bones"" storyline was entertaining.Bones (Snoop Dogg) was a player back in the 70s. He made his money selling lottery tickets, because the poor folk couldnt afford to travel out of state to buy them. He really seemed to care about his little hood. But then, one of his good friends sets up a meeting with a crooked cop. They want Bones to bring crack into the community. Bones refuses and is killed. His girlfriend is there the whole time. This is all explained through flashbacks.Fast forward to present day. Bones' girlfriend still lives in the old ""hood"" with her daughter. Meanwhile, a group of teens buy the old run down house that Bones was murdered in so many years ago. It just so happens that the father of one of the teens was that friend of Bones who set up the meeting that got him killed. He is now succesful and out of the ghetto, and is really mad that his kids bought that house, because he knows that is where they killed and buried Bones...anyway.The kids plan to turn it into a hip hop club. Bones somehow rises from the grave and causes mayhem.This movie shows gore and tries to be funny about it. The blood is a dark pink color for some reason. Most of the time it is funny. But also decent gore. It really falls apart at the end. Cheesy, stupid ending.But you can get this DVD for cheap, so I say go for it.

685310,A2AVH5HXH2TYWA,B00005UQ9I,CADJewellerySkills,"[0, 0]","This is a tricky movie to grade. Several things about it worked better than you would have expected, yet the movie is problematic enough to not quite work.Without going into too many spoilers, the movie is about Snoop Dogg's character Jimmy Bones coming back from Hell to exact revenge on those who betrayed and murdered him.Nice touches abound: the visual casting of key characters is rather good (Pam Grier as a psychic/Jimmy Bones old girl from the 70's, Michael T. Weiss as a crooked cop, etc.), the costume design and set pieces are effective, and the premise of the story itself is clever (it's quite literally about urban decay and the first introduction of crack into black neighbourhoods).Now, I have been a big fan of Snoop Dogg's easy-going style and charisma since he was introduced to the world on Dr. Dre's album ""The Chronic"". Being able to play the lead anti-hero in a horror movie is the ultimate test of his charisma tiding him over, and in that way this film is a triumph. Let's be honest-- Snoop is not a particularly strong actor. But by sheer force of screen presence alone he gets away with a consistent and watchable performance.The problem is that, for all this nice setup, something just doesn't quite work about the movie, and it's hard to put a finger on. Perhaps it's the creaky dialogue. Or perhaps the cinematography is just a bit too TV movie. Or perhaps the good guys are just so unsympathetic (for that matter, most of the characters are just plain unlikeable, good or bad.)In short: one for the cult horror geeks, or die-hard Snoop Dogg fans.",2,"Better than you would expect, but still a bit disappointing",1291852800,"12 9, 2010",2010,1577,"['tricky', 'movie', 'grade', 'Several', 'things', 'worked', 'better', 'would', 'have', 'expected', 'yet', 'movie', 'problematic', 'enough', 'not', 'quite', 'work.Without', 'going', 'too', 'many', 'spoilers', 'movie', 'Snoop', 'Dogg', 'character', 'Jimmy', 'Bones', 'coming', 'back', 'Hell', 'exact', 'revenge', 'who', 'betrayed', 'murdered', 'him.Nice', 'touches', 'visual', 'casting', 'key', 'characters', 'rather', 'good', 'Pam', 'Grier', 'psychic/Jimmy', 'Bones', 'old', 'girl', '70', 'Michael', 'T.', 'Weiss', 'crooked', 'cop', 'etc', 'costume', 'design', 'set', 'pieces', 'are', 'effective', 'premise', 'story', 'clever', 'quite', 'literally', 'urban', 'decay', 'first', 'introduction', 'crack', 'black', 'neighbourhoods', '.Now', 'have', 'been', 'big', 'fan', 'Snoop', 'Dogg', 'easy-going', 'style', 'charisma', 'was', 'introduced', 'world', 'Dr.', 'Dre', 'album', 'Chronic', 'Being', 'able', 'play', 'lead', 'anti-hero', 'horror', 'movie', 'ultimate', 'test', 'charisma', 'tiding', 'way', 'film', 'triumph', 'Let', 'be', 'honest', 'Snoop', 'not', 'particularly', 'strong', 'actor', 'sheer', 'force', 'screen', 'presence', 'alone', 'away', 'consistent', 'watchable', 'performance.The', 'problem', 'nice', 'setup', 'something', 'just', ""n't"", 'quite', 'work', 'movie', 'hard', 'put', 'finger', 'Perhaps', 'creaky', 'dialogue', 'perhaps', 'cinematography', 'just', 'bit', 'too', 'TV', 'movie', 'perhaps', 'good', 'guys', 'are', 'just', 'so', 'unsympathetic', 'matter', 'most', 'characters', 'are', 'just', 'plain', 'unlikeable', 'good', 'bad', 'short', 'one', 'cult', 'horror', 'geeks', 'die-hard', 'Snoop', 'Dogg', 'fans']",N/A

But, no such luck.  Instead he's pushed it into the background while actors of substatially less talent and charisma take the forefront.  The exception of which being Pam Grier, who in her limited screen time chews on the scenery as she seems to be having a blast playing off her Foxy Brown/Coffey image.She plays a psychic whose daughter gets involved with a teenage entrepreneur renovating the former home of benevolent gangster Jimmy Bones (Snoop), who thirty years prior was betrayed and killed by his partner with the help of a corrupt cop.  Their story is told in flashbacks and it's an interesting one at that, but it's the present day story, as the film mlingers about trying to build suspense that the movie really falls flat.  For the first two thirds we cut back and forth as it's revealed that Bones was killed after refusing to help the police distribute drugs in his neighborhood (it's not as far-fetched as it sounds).  And after his death it becomes a hotbed for illegal activity, a ghetto where rich, white prepschool kids go to score their fix. But don't read too much into this, Bones isn't as interested in social commentary as it is cheap yuks and manufactured boos.If you last beyond the maggot bath that befalls the Bones home, this after it's been transformed into an urban disco, there are a few suprising treats as Jimmy raises from his tomb to avenge his death and just generally wreck havoc.  Still, after a few snappy one-liners and a moderately funny bit about a talking severed head we're led down a gruesome, implausible path brimming with cheesy special effects and a bearly there plot that seems to have been lifted from one of the poorer installments in the Nightmare on Elm Street series.",2,Bones Is A Real Dog,1016668800,"03 21, 2002",2002,1975,"['being', 'relegated', 'menial', 'roles', 'two', 'year', 'best', 'pre-awards', 'season', 'sleepers', 'Training', 'Day', 'Baby', 'Boy', 'was', 'hoping', 'Bones', 'would', 'offer', 'Snoop', 'Dogg', 'first', 'substantial', 'part', 'would', 'catapult', 'film', 'superstardom', 'such', 'luck', 'Instead', 'pushed', 'background', 'actors', 'substatially', 'talent', 'charisma', 'take', 'forefront', 'exception', 'being', 'Pam', 'Grier', 'who', 'limited', 'screen', 'time', 'chews', 'scenery', 'be', 'having', 'blast', 'playing', 'Foxy', 'Brown/Coffey', 'image.She', 'psychic', 'daughter', 'involved', 'teenage', 'entrepreneur', 'renovating', 'former', 'home', 'benevolent', 'gangster', 'Jimmy', 'Bones', 'Snoop', 'who', 'thirty', 'years', 'prior', 'was', 'betrayed', 'killed', 'partner', 'help', 'corrupt', 'cop', 'story', 'told', 'flashbacks', 'interesting', 'one', 'present', 'day', 'story', 'film', 'mlingers', 'trying', 'build', 'suspense', 'movie', 'really', 'flat', 'first', 'two', 'thirds', 'cut', 'back', 'forth', 'revealed', 'Bones', 'was', 'killed', 'refusing', 'help', 'police', 'distribute', 'drugs', 'neighborhood', 'not', 'as', 'far-fetched', 'death', 'hotbed', 'illegal', 'activity', 'ghetto', 'where', 'rich', 'white', 'prepschool', 'kids', 'go', 'score', 'fix', 'do', ""n't"", 'read', 'too', 'much', 'Bones', ""n't"", 'as', 'interested', 'social', 'commentary', 'cheap', 'yuks', 'manufactured', 'boos.If', 'last', 'maggot', 'bath', 'Bones', 'home', 'been', 'transformed', 'urban', 'disco', 'are', 'few', 'suprising', 'treats', 'Jimmy', 'tomb', 'avenge', 'death', 'just', 'generally', 'wreck', 'havoc', 'Still', 'few', 'snappy', 'one-liners', 'moderately', 'funny', 'bit', 'talking', 'severed', 'head', ""'re"", 'led', 'down', 'gruesome', 'implausible', 'path', 'brimming', 'cheesy', 'special', 'effects', 'bearly', 'plot', 'have', 'been', 'lifted', 'one', 'poorer', 'installments', 'Nightmare', 'Elm', 'Street', 'series']",N/A

And it looks like I was right.  The film is slow and weak, Ill let it keep the one star because of the special effects. Like the dog's red eyes and snoop crawling around as a spirit. The rest is just down right cheesy. And I cant stand snoop dog, I cant stand rap period. Not trying to be racist, but snoop dog playing a ghost wanting revenge, um need I say more? The acting was also horrid, most of the characters are reading their scripts, Pam Grier did an ok job I suppose. I love horror flicks, but this movie bites the big one, its not just a slasher flick, its a boring slasher flick at that. I kept trying to wait for the movie to speed up, however if it did then it probably wouldve only been about 55 minutes long. WIll they ever have any original stories. Honestly I predicted the whole thing, and the maggots coming out of their mouths. What the hell is up with that? What has the horror scene gone too, if you like horror movies then I guess try this one out. you will probably hate it, but snoop dog fans will probably like it, only because they see him in it.",1,Plain Garbage,1014768000,"02 27, 2002",2002,1319,"['just', 'saw', 'film', 'last', 'weekend', 'wasnt', 'surprised', 'remember', 'hearing', 'buddies', 'wanting', 'get', 'together', 'go', 'see', 'movie', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'theatres', 'refused', 'told', 'id', 'wait', 'video', 'knew', 'how', 'bad', 'was', 'was', 'right', 'film', 'slow', 'weak', 'Ill', 'let', 'keep', 'one', 'star', 'special', 'effects', 'dog', 'red', 'eyes', 'snoop', 'crawling', 'around', 'spirit', 'rest', 'just', 'down', 'right', 'cheesy', 'cant', 'stand', 'snoop', 'dog', 'cant', 'stand', 'rap', 'period', 'Not', 'trying', 'be', 'racist', 'snoop', 'dog', 'playing', 'ghost', 'wanting', 'revenge', 'um', 'need', 'say', 'more', 'acting', 'was', 'also', 'horrid', 'most', 'characters', 'are', 'reading', 'scripts', 'Pam', 'Grier', 'did', 'ok', 'job', 'suppose', 'love', 'horror', 'flicks', 'movie', 'big', 'one', 'not', 'just', 'slasher', 'flick', 'boring', 'slasher', 'flick', 'kept', 'trying', 'wait', 'movie', 'speed', 'up', 'however', 'did', 'then', 'probably', 'wouldve', 'only', 'been', '55', 'minutes', 'long', 'ever', 'have', 'original', 'stories', 'Honestly', 'predicted', 'whole', 'thing', 'maggots', 'coming', 'mouths', 'What', 'hell', 'up', 'What', 'horror', 'scene', 'gone', 'too', 'like', 'horror', 'movies', 'then', 'guess', 'try', 'one', 'out', 'will', 'probably', 'hate', 'snoop', 'dog', 'fans', 'will', 'probably', 'only', 'see']",N/A

685321,A2ZB8B7VQONZA6,B00005UQ9I,"fmwaalex ""fmwaalex""","[0, 0]","BONESI love horror movies maybe more so than any other type of movie there is, I also like Ernest Dickerson, Pam Grier, Clifton Powell and Snoop Dogg. So when this film was first announced I was excited about it, a horror film involving all of them and a throwback to the blaxploitation films of old. Then when the trailer was released I couldn't wait to check it out, I still remember when it first came out, I was in Maryland at the time.Jimmy Bones [Snoop Dogg] was the man in the 70's in his neighborhood as the local baller who looks after the community. Always with his right hand man Jeremiah [Clifton Powell] and girlfriend Pearl [Pam Grier] Jimmy could not be living a better life, until a crooked cop and drug dealer brought in by Jeremiah murder him in his own building. Years go by and the neighborhood deteriorates and Jimmy's once great home is now a broke down closed up site. Locals say the place is haunted but that does not stop a group of friends from buying the property and turning it into a nightclub. Of course all is not what it seems and the discovery of a body sets a supernatural old school gangster free and out for revenge.So did the film live up to my expectations, in all honestly no. That is not to say that it is a bad movie because it really is a fun flick, your average horror flick but still fun. In fact I would go as far to say that if Dickerson was not at the helm then this would have been pretty bad. The best thing about the movie is the style in which the director made it, there are some excellent shots and images here. Of course this is not surprising seeing that Dickerson was a cinematographer before his directing days working for Spike Lee most famously. There are some legit creepy images here.The look of the film is great but what about the performances you ask, they range of course but none are horrible. Yes that goes for Snoop as well because even though he is still very much Snoop it is cool to see him here. Snoop is Snoop and will not win any acting awards here but I loved Clifton Powell in this film. He plays Jimmy's best friend and father to most of the main teens here. Of course I always love Pam Grier and I very much do here as Jimmy's girl and mother to one of the teens. Speaking of those youngsters I have to say that all were good in this flick. They of course are mostly used for the body count but hey you need that in these flicks.Written by Adam Simon and Tim Metcalfe I would have to say that ""Bones"" is one of those movies that falls right in with the time period that it came out in. It looks like and feels like a horror movie made in the early 2000's. You know the type I am speaking of, films like ""Halloween Resurrection"", ""Jason X"", ""Darkness Falls"" and so on. Now I do like all of the films I just mentioned for the most part but when I watch them I get that they were all geared to younger audiences, no complaints but you can tell the era they were made in.  Now none of that is a bad thing because like I said I enjoyed them all but at the time most horror movies kinda felt the same, that is all I am saying. The difference here in this film though is the nods to Italian horror films with Dickerson's direction. Anyone who has seen it I am sure knows what I am talking about and for those that don't, check out the special features.Which brings me to the special features on the DVD, this is an excellent DVD release. There are multi making of/behind the scenes features that add so much to the release, a great commentary track, and so much more including the music video for one of my favorite Snoop songs of all time, ""Dogg Named Snoop"". Speaking of that I highly recommend you check out the soundtrack because it is one of those actual music inspired by OST's. Full of great music especially if you enjoy darker or West Coast hip hop. Now I know that there are those that don't like this movie but I enjoyed it and thought it was fun. There is cheese to be found here but there is a lot of good to see as well.

685322,AE8W6OW6A1M5M,B00005UQ9I,Ibochild,"[0, 1]","It's been over ten years since cinematographer Ernest R. Dickerson made his feature directing debut with the urban drama, ""Juice."" Since that time Dickerson has emerged as one of the hardest working journeymen in the business. The volume of his creative output rivals that of his former collaborator, Spike Lee. In 1998 alone, Dickerson directed three feature length projects.While clearly a technically competent director, his work tends to fall short in some way or another. ""Bones"" is no exception.It tells the story of Jimmy Bones (played adequately by rapper Snoop Dogg) as a popular underworld figure that is double crossed by his own men, resulting in his murder.Some twenty years later, the ghost of Bones returns to get back at those who killed him. This is hardly an original storyline, even for a black film. The plot is essentially similiar to ""J.D.'s Revenge,"" a film starring Glynn Turman, that was released in 1976.The corpse of Bones resides in an abandoned house. It just happens to be recently purchased by Patrick (Khalil Kain of ""Juice""), the son of Jeremiah Peet (Clifton Powell), one of the men who betrayed him. Patrick and his partners plan to convert the house into a hot nightspot. As expected, Bones lashes out at a bunch of people, who mostly end up dead.In the process, the audience experiences some better than average special effects. Obviously, much thought was put into the film's production design. If only the same were true for the very predictable and obvious script. Adam Simon and Tim Metcalfe's screenplay leaves very little to the imagination.In terms of acting, it is generally way over the top. This is true pretty much across the board -- from the veteran actors to the less experienced members of the cast. Standard for movies of this type, the film's exaggerated acting is not necessarily a criticism. At the very least, the actors all know that they are in a B-movie and not say, ""Silence of the Lambs.""The DVD features the standard extras. This includes audio commentary by Dickerson, Simon and Snoop Dogg. The dominant theme of the commentary seems to be how the studio was constantly trying to ""dumb down"" the material. Perhaps they are right.However, given some of the B-movies that Dickerson cites as inspiration, even if he was given complete artistic freedom, the picture would never have risen to the level of the gothic horror masterpiece that he was obviously striving to reach. From the looks of things, Dickerson had some intriguing ideas, but didn't quite know what to do with them.Overall, ""Bones"" is a decent time filler. For fans of horror B-movies, there are plenty of jolts, visual effects and gory scenes to keep you interested. If you don't come expecting anything special, you won't be disappointed.Be sure to bring plenty of popcorn.",3,"Horror B-Movie: Nothing More, Nothing Less",1047513600,"03 13, 2003",2003,2802,"['been', 'ten', 'years', 'cinematographer', 'Ernest', 'R.', 'Dickerson', 'made', 'feature', 'directing', 'debut', 'urban', 'drama', 'Juice', 'time', 'Dickerson', 'emerged', 'one', 'hardest', 'working', 'journeymen', 'business', 'volume', 'creative', 'output', 'rivals', 'former', 'collaborator', 'Spike', 'Lee', '1998', 'alone', 'Dickerson', 'directed', 'three', 'feature', 'length', 'projects.While', 'clearly', 'technically', 'competent', 'director', 'work', 'fall', 'short', 'way', 'Bones', 'exception.It', 'story', 'Jimmy', 'Bones', 'played', 'adequately', 'rapper', 'Snoop', 'Dogg', 'popular', 'underworld', 'figure', 'double', 'crossed', 'own', 'men', 'resulting', 'murder.Some', 'twenty', 'years', 'later', 'ghost', 'Bones', 'returns', 'get', 'back', 'who', 'killed', 'hardly', 'original', 'storyline', 'even', 'black', 'film', 'plot', 'essentially', 'similiar', 'J.D', 'Revenge', 'film', 'starring', 'Glynn', 'Turman', 'was', 'released', '1976.The', 'corpse', 'Bones', 'resides', 'abandoned', 'house', 'just', 'be', 'recently', 'purchased', 'Patrick', 'Khalil', 'Kain', 'Juice', 'son', 'Jeremiah', 'Peet', 'Clifton', 'Powell', 'one', 'men', 'who', 'betrayed', 'Patrick', 'partners', 'plan', 'convert', 'house', 'hot', 'nightspot', 'expected', 'Bones', 'out', 'bunch', 'people', 'who', 'mostly', 'end', 'up', 'dead.In', 'process', 'audience', 'better', 'average', 'special', 'effects', 'Obviously', 'much', 'thought', 'was', 'put', 'film', 'production', 'design', 'only', 'same', 'were', 'true', 'very', 'predictable', 'obvious', 'script', 'Adam', 'Simon', 'Tim', 'Metcalfe', 'screenplay', 'very', 'little', 'imagination.In', 'terms', 'acting', 'generally', 'way', 'top', 'true', 'pretty', 'much', 'board', 'veteran', 'actors', 'less', 'experienced', 'members', 'cast', 'Standard', 'movies', 'type', 'film', 'exaggerated', 'acting', 'not', 'necessarily', 'criticism', 'very', 'least', 'actors', 'know', 'are', 'B-movie', 'not', 'say', 'Silence', 'Lambs', 'DVD', 'standard', 'extras', 'audio', 'commentary', 'Dickerson', 'Simon', 'Snoop', 'Dogg', 'dominant', 'theme', 'commentary', 'be', 'how', 'studio', 'was', 'constantly', 'trying', 'dumb', 'down', 'material', 'Perhaps', 'are', 'right.However', 'given', 'B-movies', 'Dickerson', 'inspiration', 'even', 'was', 'given', 'complete', 'artistic', 'freedom', 'picture', 'would', 'never', 'have', 'risen', 'level', 'gothic', 'horror', 'masterpiece', 'was', 'obviously', 'striving', 'reach', 'looks', 'things', 'Dickerson', 'had', 'intriguing', 'ideas', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'know', 'what', 'do', 'them.Overall', 'Bones', 'decent', 'time', 'filler', 'fans', 'horror', 'B-movies', 'are', 'plenty', 'jolts', 'visual', 'effects', 'gory', 'scenes', 'keep', 'interested', 'do', ""n't"", 'come', 'expecting', 'anything', 'special', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed.Be', 'sure', 'bring', 'plenty', 'popcorn']",N/A

I respect Snoop as a rap artist, but this movie only proves that he CAN'T ACT! I know he wants to be successful like a lot of other rappers turned actors have been in the past, but what he must realize first is that you have to have... TRUE ACTING ABILITY! first and foremost. I mean, it's obvious that he's trying way too hard. At any rate, to explain this movie in a nutshell, Snoop plays Jimmy Bones, a murdered pimp, that has returned from the grave a vengeful spirit to seek revenge. That's it! The story ends there pretty much. There's nothing to this movie. It looks like someone got a camcorder at recorded this in their own neighborhood. The special effects are cheesy as hell. Somebody else beat me to mentioning the pink blood. It doesn't look professionally done at all. The story is not deep or thought provoking at all.

685332,A3PPXVR5J6U2JD,B00005UQ9I,"Michael J. Tresca ""Talien""","[2, 2]","Putting Snoop Dogg in a horror film is a bold move. Making that horror film a throwback to Italian horror and Blaxploitation movies is a really bold move.  Along the way, Bones sneaks in commentary about the African-American struggle to succeed while remaining true to one's roots. It's not your average horror flick by any measure.Dogg plays Jimmy Bones, a drug dealer who is a romantic ideal - he doesn't dabble in anything as denigrating as selling lottery tickets, he refuses to work with The Man (embodied by Michael T. Weiss as Lupovich, an over-the-top corrupt cop), and he absolutely refuses to deal crack cocaine.  What Bones doesn't realize is that there's no room in the dog-eat-dog world (get it?  Snoop Dogg is in this film!) for a drug dealer with standards.  When he turns down rival drug dealer Eddie Mack's (Ricky Harris) offer, Bones is betrayed by lieutenant Jeremiah Peet (Clifton Powell), girlfriend Pearl (Pam Grier), and bodyguard Shotgun (Ron Selmour) all who literally stab him in the back - and in the front - at Lupovich's gunpoint.  Buried in the church he called home, Bones swears revenge.Flash forward to the present day. Unbeknownst to Jeremiah, his rebellious progeny Patrick (Khalil Kain), Bill (Merwin Mondesir) and Tia (Katharine Isabelle) are planning to start a club in the same abandoned church. It's interesting in that Patrick and Bill are dark-skinned and Tia is white - a blend that's a result of Jeremiah's mixed marriage.  The movie makes no mention of this, but it lurks in the background of a discussion between the three middle-class kids who argue with their father that crack cocaine was concocted by The Man.  Director Ernest Dickerson mythologizes this conflict in Bones' refusal to play along with Mack.The young upstarts cause quite a bit of a ruckus in their father's old neighborhood, immediately noticed by Shotgun (who for some reason lives across the street from the church that regularly tries to eat him), Pearl and daughter Cynthia (smoking hot Bianca Lawson) and a black mongrel nicknamed Bones that Tia decides to adopt.  You can probably guess what moment Bones chooses to manifest and cause havoc.On the one hand, Bones is a near pitch-perfect love note to Blaxploitation films and horror movies.  The blood is candy-colored, maggots explode out of everywhere, and Bones has all the creepy menace of Francis Ford Coppola's Dracula. Snoop himself is perfect for the part; his dead-eyed, lazy gaze shifts from unfocused benevolence to piercing rage.  Snoop doesn't have to do much - his presence and the film's special effects do his talking for him.On the other hand, the characters are almost unilaterally ridiculous.  Patrick and Cynthia's romance is non-existent - she shows up at the church, gets yelled at by her mother, and then returns to the club to make out with Patrick.  There's no spark between them and no reason given for their relationship - she's just eye candy forcefully inserted into the plot because she's pivotal to what happens later.The special effects range from spectacular (you haven't lived until you've seen a dog barf maggots) to ridiculous (the maggots are interspersed with orzo, which is obvious on a high definition television). The movie's tone also teeters from brutal and terrifying to self-mockingly hilarious as Bones collects several animated heads for his collection in hell.Bones is an odd duck.  It wants to be a horror flick, an homage, social media commentary, a black comedy, and a Snoop Dogg media vehicle.

Bones stars Snoop Dogg, Pam Grier, Khalil Cain and Clifton Powell.Bones is a tale of betrayal, murder and revenge.  It is also a story within a story.  The past and present day scenes are mixed together nicely.  If the viewer needs a potty break or snack, my advice is to pause the tape...you don't want to miss a single detail.In 1979, Jimmy Bones (Snoop Dogg) was a well respected hoodlum for lack of a better title, who loved and protected his black community.  Other street hustlers wanted to bring crack into the hood and Jimmy Bones did not approve.  He is brutally murdered in front of his woman (Pam Grier), body guard and childhood buddy.Present day has some young buppies from the suburbs purchasing property in the ghetto/hood so that they can open a club as a business venture.  They want to show themselves approved to their successful father.  After purchasing the run down brownstone that belonged to Jimmy Bones, the terror is unleashed!  Prepare yourself for thrills, chills, terror, bloody murder scenes and lots of screams with a bit of humor added in the most unlikely spots.  As the story merges 1979 and present day (twenty plus years later) you will know that this should be a classic and wonder why it did not get as much recognition as it should have at the box office.For those old school viewers...the writer's inspiration must have been the 1970s horror flick J.D.'s Revenge.",5,Black Horror Flick Merits 5 Stars!,1017532800,"03 31, 2002",2002,1501,"['Bones', 'african-american', 'horror', 'flick', 'can', 'stand', 'white', 'cast', 'horrors', 'Bones', 'stars', 'Snoop', 'Dogg', 'Pam', 'Grier', 'Khalil', 'Cain', 'Clifton', 'Powell.Bones', 'tale', 'betrayal', 'murder', 'revenge', 'also', 'story', 'story', 'past', 'present', 'day', 'scenes', 'are', 'mixed', 'together', 'nicely', 'viewer', 'potty', 'break', 'snack', 'advice', 'pause', 'tape', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'miss', 'single', 'detail.In', '1979', 'Jimmy', 'Bones', 'Snoop', 'Dogg', 'was', 'well', 'respected', 'hoodlum', 'lack', 'better', 'title', 'who', 'loved', 'protected', 'black', 'community', 'Other', 'street', 'hustlers', 'wanted', 'bring', 'crack', 'hood', 'Jimmy', 'Bones', 'did', 'not', 'approve', 'brutally', 'murdered', 'front', 'woman', 'Pam', 'Grier', 'body', 'guard', 'childhood', 'buddy.Present', 'day', 'young', 'buppies', 'suburbs', 'purchasing', 'property', 'ghetto/hood', 'so', 'can', 'open', 'club', 'business', 'venture', 'want', 'show', 'approved', 'successful', 'father', 'purchasing', 'run', 'down', 'brownstone', 'belonged', 'Jimmy', 'Bones', 'terror', 'unleashed', 'Prepare', 'thrills', 'chills', 'terror', 'bloody', 'murder', 'scenes', 'lots', 'screams', 'bit', 'humor', 'added', 'most', 'unlikely', 'spots', 'story', 'merges', '1979', 'present', 'day', 'twenty', 'years', 'later', 'will', 'know', 'should', 'be', 'classic', 'wonder', 'why', 'did', 'not', 'get', 'much', 'recognition', 'should', 'have', 'box', 'office.For', 'old', 'school', 'viewers', 'writer', 'inspiration', 'must', 'have', 'been', '1970s', 'horror', 'flick', 'J.D', 'Revenge']",N/A

685336,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B00005UQ9I,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[4, 7]","Bones (Ernest R. Dickerson, 2001)Man, Bones has gotten a lot of bad press over the years. I'm not terribly sure why, given how many films I've seen that are so, so much worse than this is.Snoop Dogg (fresh off the best acting job of his career, as the paraplegic dealer in Training Day) is Jimmy Bones, a seventies numbers runner who was murdered in his home twenty years ago, and has haunted the place since. He wants revenge on the people who were involved in the murder. Problem is, his ghost is trapped in the house, and the conspirators won't come near it. Enter an enterprising group of youngsters who buy the place with the intention of turning it into a club. Well, what Bones needs in order to get himself a physical form (as anyone who's seen Hellraiser knows) is human blood. And one of the group (Sean Amsing, recently of Disturbing Behavior) does something stupid...There are about a hundred good reasons to watch this film, and playing spot-the-influence is only one of them. (There's a particularly touching tribute to Suspiria, which isn't terribly surprising when you realize that between them, the Simon-and-Metcalfe team who penned this have been responsible for such flicks as Braindead, Carnosaur, Fright Night Part II, Kalifornia, and a number of others; these guys have taste.) Katharine Isabelle, the gorgeous redhead from the Ginger Snaps movies, is one of them, although her part seems to be partially to scream and partially to rile up the anti-miscegenation crowd. But any time Isabelle lights up a screen, it's a good thing. Snoop does some decent acting, though he does get a little melodramatic during the death-scene flashback. (Granted, so does everyone else.) Michael T. Weiss (Jeffrey) shows that he can not only play a bad guy, but chew scenery, just as well as Charlton Heston ever did.But the acting is not the main reason to be here; the cinematography is. There's a piece of the main title scene that is absolutely disturbing; the filtering and shaking turn the shot into a really ugly peyote trip that's combining in your stomach with that burrito that you knew had something in it that was going to give you food poisoning. While the effect is used a couple more times in the film, it's not overused, and that is a very good thing. You probably haven't seen the name Flavio Labiano before-- he's mostly done direct-to-video action flicks-- but you'll see it again. Soon.I think much of the reason the film's gotten so much bad press is that it's a lot closer to the extreme horror line than most American films, but it never crosses over into Takashi Miike or Hidshi Hino territory. Dickerson keeps a very light touch, making a number of the gore scenes humorous a la Miike, but Dickerson is not the director Miike is, and so the scenes come off a little limp; he never goes far enough to give Asian gore fans a real thrill, but is way, way over the Hollywood line. It's almost as if Dickerson wanted to go there, but got reined in by the studio, creating a result unsatisfying to pretty much everyone.Still, there are some very good reasons to watch this movie.

685341,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00005UQ9I,Tsuyoshi,"[4, 6]","I watched this film in Osaka, Japan at a small theater with only three audiences (including me).  Though I admit I enjoyed watching it,  there are lots of complaints about this one; I can hear loud  BOOs all around.  Yes, I understand, this is not for everybody's idea of enjoying a scary night because the film is NOT what it was expected to be.  Black dog with eyes shining red?  And that is supposed to be reincarnation of Jimmy Bones, long dead in a cellar, played by Snoop Dogg?  It sounds like a bad joke, but wait!  I believe there are some misunderstanding among us, so let's set the record straight.  &quot;Bones&quot; is a horror flick, but not prefectly so.First of all, at some points the film might possibly scare you, you don't have to take everything so seriously.  Look at how &quot;Bones&quot; starts -- it shows a diapidated house that exactly looks like a skull.  Now you should know what &quot;Bones&quot; is all about -- it is done with tongue-in-cheek attitude.  And with a pre-credit sequence that is fairly scary, the film jumps back into the time of 1979 (!), when the neighborhood was still lively with Afro-American kids, and there comes Snoop Doggs' hustler Jimmy Bones, with a big diamond ring and a switchblade knife, his girlfriend being Pam Grier, goddess of blaxploitaion films that flourished in the 1970s.  Wow.The film then goes on, unfolding the two stories that finally joins in the end; four young actors who are going to redecorate the haunted house as a night club, and the fate of Jimmy Bones.  Thanks to its tightly-knit script, &quot;Bones&quot; succeeds not to fall into a predictable development, even though close at the ending it looks still muddled.  There are lots of blood, nightmare, worms (alive) falling from up above, flying knives and talking heads made by CGIs, and Snoop Dogg's Jimmy Bones' revenge story and Pam Grier as a medium who uses supernatural power.  Too much?  Sure, it is.  Laughable?  Maybe.  But never dull.To me, &quot;Bones&quot; is interesting because it reminds me of 70s Afro-American pictures.  Pam Grier, who as far as I remember never played the role of mother, is great in this rather confusing heap of horror and twisted humor, and as her daughter Bianca Lawson (&quot;Dawson's Creek&quot;) is also good.  Snoop Dogg cuts a nice figure as the title role, but his screen time is not as long as his fans might want it to be.But most interesting thing is the presence of director Ernest Dickerson, whose outstanding career as a photographer of Spike Lee's films should be known to all of us.  His original styles (fast-editing, slanted picture, etc) are also shown here, but I find it intriguing that his taste as a movie fan has much influenced &quot;Bones.&quot;  Bunches of zombies, worms, and so on -- these &quot;bad taste&quot; elements are, of course, his answer to Dario Argento and Italian horror school, and as this Italia maestro  often sacrifices the plot in order to create his unique (too Unique) styles, so Dickerson half-jokingly shows off his love of genre with a help from good production design, and ridiculously overblown direction.So, this is a horror film, but is a kind of homage to European ones, or blaxploitaion flims such as, most notably, &quot;J.D.'s Revenge&quot; which some part of the story resembles.
