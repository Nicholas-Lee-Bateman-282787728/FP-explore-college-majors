506170,A2Q5PDCSQ1JSF1,B00000JGOD,Benjamin Scott,"[19, 20]","I was introduced to this film by a friend whose taste in movies I usually question. This one, however, did much for my respect of him.This movie was pure hilarity, and amazingly original and the actors, as opposed to  many of Hollywood's teen models, were surprisingly good. Peter (Joshua  Schaefer) is in love with the beautiful and unobtainable Erica (Keri  Russell). At the urging of his hilarious grandfather Nonno (Buck Kartalian)  and against the wishes of his mother, father, and obscenely peurile best  friend (R.D. Robb) he proceeds to wait night and day on her lawn. What  follows is a coming of age adventure with so many eclectic and almost  random twists that there is simply not a dull moment.Eight Days a Week  is a great movie for teenagers. It's post-graduation summer is hilarious  and raunchy but manages to keep its head above the water instead of relying  on shock value. It is a truly memorable teen comedy.

The movie delivered on all the eye candy I was expecting. I have to give credit to the director for getting her to run through the sprinkler in the thin white shirt.  It instantly became see-through and the slow motion was awesome!  Thanks for that!  There are some other really good eye candy scenes.  As far as the story, it's pretty funny at times. It's not your typical shallow teen movie.I highly recommend this movie to fans of Keri Russell and also to fans of teenager movies.Four stars!",4,Keri Russell is sexy,1239148800,"04 8, 2009",2009,620,"['First', 'have', 'tell', 'got', 'movie', ""'m"", 'fan', 'Keri', 'Russell', 'movie', 'pretty', 'sexy', 'flirty', 'movie', 'delivered', 'eye', 'candy', 'was', 'expecting', 'have', 'give', 'credit', 'director', 'getting', 'run', 'sprinkler', 'thin', 'white', 'shirt', 'instantly', 'became', 'see-through', 'slow', 'motion', 'was', 'awesome', 'Thanks', 'are', 'other', 'really', 'good', 'eye', 'candy', 'scenes', 'As', 'far', 'story', 'pretty', 'funny', 'times', 'not', 'typical', 'shallow', 'teen', 'movie.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'movie', 'fans', 'Keri', 'Russell', 'also', 'fans', 'teenager', 'movies.Four', 'stars']",Eight Days a Week VHS

Keri Russell is the object of a likable dweeb's romantic obsession in the cheerfully raunchy comedy Eight Days a Week.

Perhaps he can win her attention by paying constant attention. So Peter camps out beneath Erica's balcony.

506175,A2YQ5O6XV23543,B00000JGOD,Kevin H. Dudley,"[10, 13]","I caught this movie on late night cable one weekend. I was suffering from a prolonged allergy attack that had knocked me on my @$$ and made me wish that someone would put me out of my misery. Usually, when I'm sick like this, I'll watch stuff on T.V. that I normally would pass on since my mind is somewhere else. While flipping through the movie channels I saw that a movie starring the extremely cute Keri Russell (best known as T.V.'s Felicity) called Eight Days a Week was coming on, that it was Rated-R and contained strong sexual content. Curious to see what Ms. Russell looked like minus most of her clothes (though she doesn't go all the way), I proceeded to watch the film expecting a disaster/guilty pleasure.To my surprise, this movie turned out to be a decent little teen-romantic-comedy. The acting is solid, there were some genuinely funny moments, the main character who camps out on Keri's lawn reminded me sometimes of Woody Allen as a teenager and Ms. Russell was extremely beautiful and sweet. (On the completely shallow and superficial front, Keri Russell doesn't actually do any nudity, though she comes frustratingly close at numerous occasions.)The basic plot involves Peter (Joshua Schaefer), a nerdy teen who has a huge crush on the gorgeous Erica (Keri Russell) who lives across the street. He tries to get her attention but she's wrapped up in a relationship with a stereotypical jock. Peter than decides after getting advice from his Grandfather to camp out on her lawn (all day and night) and not leaving until she lets him profess his admiration for her and hopefully starts going out with him.That's essentially the whole plot. There are various characters that weave in and out of the movie. In addition to Peter's grandpa, he has a best friend who is extremely oversexed and will do anything to get laid. Erica's parents are extremely devout Christians and are very strict with her. There's a middle-aged woman with whom Peter's friend has a crush on. One of the neighbors also is carrying mysterious trash bags out to his car and Peter and his friend start thinking that the guy might have killed somebody and is disposing of the body (of course they're very wrong.)The movie features some pretty insightful viewpoints on teen relationships and society in general. I particularly liked Peter's viewpoints on almost everyone who lives near him and how peculiar their behavior sometimes was. On the downside, I found his best friend to be somewhat annoying and his attempts at being funny somewhat forced. He's the apparent goofy sidekick/comic relief of the movie, and unfortunately, he ground the movie to a halt whenever he was on screen. There's also a couple of pointless subplots involving people in his neighborhood that just come across as an effort to pad out the movie's running time.But most people will probably check out this movie specifically for (a pre-Felicity) Keri Russell. She really did a great acting job and made her character genuinely sweet. Once she makes her entrance in the movie, it's not any mystery as to why Peter is madly in love with her.Anyone who is a fan of her will want to check out this movie ASAP. The opening scene, for instance, has her frolicking in a water sprinkler wearing a wet t-shirt and extremely tight shorts. There's another in which she's in a very tight bikini and the camera slowly pans over her entire body in explicit detail. She does numerous revealing shots (including a couple of surprising crotch shots) in tight dresses and underwear, but unfortunately, no nudity. But it's refreshing that the writer/director actually gave her character some depth and didn't treat her completely as eye candy (though she excels in that department).While some of the movie gets quite raunchy at times, it is actually surprisingly restrained at times and doesn't come close to approaching American Pie gross-out territory.While not anything memorable or spectacular, Eight Days of Week does have its moments and isn't a complete waste of time if you happen to run across it on cable or your local video store. It's a great showcase for the lovely and talented Keri Russell and is much better than a lot of similar teen romantic comedies. I give it 3 1/2 stars out of 5.Eights Days a Week is rated R and contains strong sexual content, nudity and language.",3,A decent teen romantic comedy starring a gorgeous pre-Felicity Keri Russell.,1130889600,"11 2, 2005",2005,4333,"['caught', 'movie', 'late', 'night', 'cable', 'one', 'weekend', 'was', 'suffering', 'prolonged', 'allergy', 'attack', 'had', 'knocked', '@', 'made', 'wish', 'someone', 'would', 'put', 'misery', 'Usually', 'when', ""'m"", 'sick', ""'ll"", 'watch', 'stuff', 'T.V', 'normally', 'would', 'pass', 'mind', 'somewhere', 'else', 'flipping', 'movie', 'channels', 'saw', 'movie', 'starring', 'extremely', 'cute', 'Keri', 'Russell', 'best', 'known', 'T.V', 'Felicity', 'called', 'Eight', 'Days', 'Week', 'was', 'coming', 'was', 'Rated-R', 'contained', 'strong', 'sexual', 'content', 'Curious', 'see', 'what', 'Ms.', 'Russell', 'looked', 'minus', 'most', 'clothes', ""n't"", 'go', 'way', 'proceeded', 'watch', 'film', 'expecting', 'disaster/guilty', 'pleasure.To', 'surprise', 'movie', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'decent', 'little', 'teen-romantic-comedy', 'acting', 'solid', 'were', 'genuinely', 'funny', 'moments', 'main', 'character', 'who', 'out', 'Keri', 'lawn', 'reminded', 'sometimes', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'teenager', 'Ms.', 'Russell', 'was', 'extremely', 'beautiful', 'sweet', 'completely', 'shallow', 'superficial', 'front', 'Keri', 'Russell', ""n't"", 'actually', 'do', 'nudity', 'frustratingly', 'close', 'numerous', 'occasions', 'basic', 'plot', 'involves', 'Peter', 'Joshua', 'Schaefer', 'nerdy', 'teen', 'who', 'huge', 'crush', 'gorgeous', 'Erica', 'Keri', 'Russell', 'who', 'street', 'get', 'attention', 'wrapped', 'up', 'relationship', 'stereotypical', 'jock', 'Peter', 'decides', 'getting', 'advice', 'Grandfather', 'camp', 'out', 'lawn', 'day', 'night', 'not', 'leaving', 'profess', 'admiration', 'hopefully', 'going', 'out', 'essentially', 'whole', 'plot', 'are', 'various', 'characters', 'weave', 'movie', 'addition', 'Peter', 'grandpa', 'best', 'friend', 'who', 'extremely', 'oversexed', 'will', 'do', 'anything', 'get', 'laid', 'Erica', 'parents', 'are', 'extremely', 'devout', 'Christians', 'are', 'very', 'strict', 'middle-aged', 'woman', 'whom', 'Peter', 'friend', 'crush', 'One', 'neighbors', 'also', 'carrying', 'mysterious', 'trash', 'bags', 'out', 'car', 'Peter', 'friend', 'start', 'thinking', 'guy', 'might', 'have', 'killed', 'somebody', 'disposing', 'body', 'course', ""'re"", 'very', 'wrong', 'movie', 'pretty', 'insightful', 'viewpoints', 'teen', 'relationships', 'society', 'general', 'particularly', 'liked', 'Peter', 'viewpoints', 'almost', 'everyone', 'who', 'how', 'peculiar', 'behavior', 'sometimes', 'was', 'downside', 'found', 'best', 'friend', 'be', 'somewhat', 'annoying', 'attempts', 'being', 'funny', 'somewhat', 'forced', 'apparent', 'goofy', 'sidekick/comic', 'relief', 'movie', 'unfortunately', 'ground', 'movie', 'halt', 'whenever', 'was', 'screen', 'also', 'couple', 'pointless', 'subplots', 'involving', 'people', 'neighborhood', 'just', 'come', 'across', 'effort', 'pad', 'out', 'movie', 'running', 'most', 'people', 'will', 'probably', 'check', 'out', 'movie', 'specifically', 'pre-Felicity', 'Keri', 'Russell', 'really', 'did', 'great', 'acting', 'job', 'made', 'character', 'genuinely', 'sweet', 'entrance', 'movie', 'not', 'mystery', 'why', 'Peter', 'madly', 'love', 'her.Anyone', 'who', 'fan', 'will', 'want', 'check', 'out', 'movie', 'ASAP', 'opening', 'scene', 'instance', 'frolicking', 'water', 'sprinkler', 'wearing', 'wet', 't-shirt', 'extremely', 'tight', 'shorts', 'very', 'tight', 'bikini', 'camera', 'slowly', 'entire', 'body', 'explicit', 'detail', 'numerous', 'revealing', 'shots', 'including', 'couple', 'surprising', 'crotch', 'shots', 'tight', 'dresses', 'underwear', 'unfortunately', 'nudity', 'refreshing', 'writer/director', 'actually', 'gave', 'character', 'depth', 'did', ""n't"", 'treat', 'completely', 'eye', 'candy', 'department', 'movie', 'quite', 'raunchy', 'times', 'actually', 'surprisingly', 'restrained', 'times', ""n't"", 'come', 'close', 'approaching', 'American', 'Pie', 'gross-out', 'territory.While', 'not', 'anything', 'memorable', 'spectacular', 'Eight', 'Days', 'Week', 'have', 'moments', ""n't"", 'complete', 'waste', 'time', 'happen', 'run', 'cable', 'local', 'video', 'store', 'great', 'showcase', 'lovely', 'talented', 'Keri', 'Russell', 'much', 'better', 'lot', 'similar', 'teen', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'give', '3', '1/2', 'stars', '5.Eights', 'Days', 'Week', 'rated', 'R', 'strong', 'sexual', 'content', 'nudity', 'language']",Eight Days a Week VHS
