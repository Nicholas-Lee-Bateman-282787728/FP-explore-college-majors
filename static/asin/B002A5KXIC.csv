I miss on this DVD (and on the the others of WB's Archive Collection) subtitles but well.The picture quality could be a little bit better but is OK. The sound is just in mono only.The movie is a sort of Pre-""Airport"" film.TriviaWhile Efrem Zimbalist Jr. and Troy Donahue are talking in the airport coffee shop, the music playing in the background is ""Theme from A Summer Place"" by Percy Faith and His Orchestra, taken from a movie in which Donahue starred: A Summer Place (1959).In this film, _Efrem Zimbalist Jr._ plays a military jet pilot who crashes his plane into the commercial DC-6 piloted by Dana Andrews. About a decade and a half later, Andrews would return the favor as his character's private plane crashed into Zimbalist's commercial jet in Airport 1975 (1974).",4,no bonus feature or subtitle,1270944000,"04 11, 2010",2010,947,"['never', 'heard', 'seen', 'movie', 'was', 'wondering', 'John', 'Kerr', 'South', 'Pacific', 'Troy', 'Donahue', 'Summer', 'Place', '.The', 'format', 'original', 'aspect', 'ratio', '1.85:1', 'miss', 'DVD', 'others', 'WB', 'Archive', 'Collection', 'subtitles', 'well.The', 'picture', 'quality', 'could', 'be', 'little', 'bit', 'better', 'OK', 'sound', 'just', 'mono', 'only.The', 'movie', 'sort', 'Pre-', 'Airport', 'film.TriviaWhile', 'Efrem', 'Zimbalist', 'Jr.', 'Troy', 'Donahue', 'are', 'talking', 'airport', 'coffee', 'shop', 'music', 'playing', 'background', 'Theme', 'A', 'Summer', 'Place', 'Percy', 'Faith', 'Orchestra', 'taken', 'movie', 'Donahue', 'starred', 'Summer', 'Place', '1959', '.In', 'film', '_Efrem', 'Zimbalist', 'Jr._', 'military', 'jet', 'pilot', 'who', 'plane', 'commercial', 'DC-6', 'piloted', 'Dana', 'Andrews', 'decade', 'half', 'later', 'Andrews', 'would', 'return', 'favor', 'character', 'private', 'plane', 'crashed', 'Zimbalist', 'commercial', 'jet', 'Airport', '1975', '1974']",The Crowded Sky

The two brightest roles were that handled by the always beautiful and talented Rhonda Fleming and the lovely and lively Anne Frances.

A Navy jet with Efrem Zimbalist Jr. and Troy Donahue heads east while an airline piloted by Dana Andrews carrying 62 passengers flies west and their meeting is inevitable. It lacks the tight structure of William Wellman's MIGHTY as well as the fully developed characters. Most of the minor characters are telegraphed to us via voice overs so that we're not attached to them enough to really care about their fate.
