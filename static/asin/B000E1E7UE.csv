964961,A3O8PRRQT3DPF8,B000E1E7UE,A. Anderson,"[1, 1]","I have wanted this set on and off for a while now, just never made the motion to get it.  The colorization of season 1 left me cold and never paid it anymore attention.  Now with this new complete collection you get the entire series and one drawback,you get season one in colorized form only.  So, you will have to get the B&W season set on its own to be a purist.  I picked up the new Mill Creek Seasons 1-2 set in B&W for under $10. The prints look fine.  Many have complained about the one large stack spindle that all of the 20 DVDs are housed on inside the box.  Come one, you have the entire series for far less than it used to cost, and can you REALLY watch all 20 at the same time?  I take out 1-2 discs in order and watch those, then put them back on the bottom and take out the next 2 discs to watch in sequence.  This cuts down on package breakdown for the set.  I did this with Charlie's Angels Complete Series Box (same Spindle set up) and it make it easy.  Unless you watch the show for 12 hours solid as a marathon, you can take 1-3 discs out at a time and finish them before putting them away and swapping out for the next ones.  I prefer this type of packaging if I can get a reduced cost overall. I appreciate the savings and being able to have the whole thing in one case.  All the prints look great and for a guilty pleasure, I always liked the show.",4,I DREAMED OF A COMPLETE SERIES COLLECTION,1403136000,"06 19, 2014",2014,1371,"['have', 'wanted', 'set', 'while', 'now', 'just', 'never', 'made', 'motion', 'get', 'colorization', 'season', '1', 'left', 'cold', 'never', 'paid', 'anymore', 'attention', 'Now', 'new', 'complete', 'collection', 'get', 'entire', 'series', 'one', 'drawback', 'get', 'season', 'one', 'colorized', 'form', 'only', 'So', 'will', 'have', 'get', 'B', 'W', 'season', 'set', 'own', 'be', 'purist', 'picked', 'up', 'new', 'Mill', 'Creek', 'Seasons', '1-2', 'set', 'B', 'W', '10', 'prints', 'look', 'fine', 'Many', 'have', 'complained', 'one', 'large', 'stack', 'spindle', '20', 'DVDs', 'are', 'housed', 'box', 'Come', 'one', 'have', 'entire', 'series', 'far', 'less', 'used', 'cost', 'can', 'REALLY', 'watch', '20', 'same', 'time', 'take', 'out', '1-2', 'discs', 'order', 'watch', 'then', 'put', 'back', 'bottom', 'take', 'out', 'next', '2', 'discs', 'watch', 'sequence', 'down', 'package', 'breakdown', 'set', 'did', 'Charlie', 'Angels', 'Complete', 'Series', 'Box', 'same', 'Spindle', 'set', 'up', 'make', 'easy', 'watch', 'show', '12', 'hours', 'solid', 'marathon', 'can', 'take', '1-3', 'discs', 'out', 'time', 'finish', 'putting', 'away', 'swapping', 'out', 'next', 'ones', 'prefer', 'type', 'packaging', 'can', 'get', 'reduced', 'cost', 'overall', 'appreciate', 'savings', 'being', 'able', 'have', 'whole', 'thing', 'one', 'case', 'prints', 'look', 'great', 'guilty', 'pleasure', 'always', 'liked', 'show']",I Dream Of Jeannie Complete DVD Television Series

How couldn't video company neglect our educational needs such as English subtitle?

964964,A189BCLUUMSM7E,B000E1E7UE,awakeneddragon,"[2, 2]","Watched this as a kid in my grandparent's house. I don't remember any specific episodes, but I remember the opening well.The series made leaps and bounds as it advanced. Early on, sets end or the painted backdrops are a bit too painted, but throw in trips to Hawaii and actual footage of various Air Force and NASA instillations definitely improves things. Several musical and other entertainment guest stars appear, which was a surprise. Fun to see the era in this show.As for the seasons overall, there are some moments where I just hate Roger for trying to steal Jeannie, but he's forgivable in the end. The episodes and seasons progress well. Early on the episodes seem more interested in connecting and really playing on being discovered. This occasionally resurfaces, but the series has crazy fun. Becoming a rodeo, piano, and every other kind of virtuoso only for the episode appears a lot.I wish there were chapter skips within the episodes to skip the opening song (though, I watched it plenty of times). Not enough series do this. No big deal. My only real disappointment with the series itself is that there is no real end. You watch the last episode of the season, and it doesn't wrap up anything. This is odd considering that the last season does include an episode that seems to do just that--and ends up being a dream sequence. Huh.Other than this, everyone's disappointment over the packaging is about right. I never keep such things so I didn't mind this.All in all, if you ever saw the show, this is a good buy.

964966,A1O3U4FS19BB4U,B000E1E7UE,Casey Biddle,"[1, 1]","This review is for the I Dream Of Jeanie complete set.  The smaller version.  All the disks are placed on one spindle stacked one on top of the other.  When it first arrived I wasn&#8217;t thrilled about the packaging.  I thought it was going to be a lot of trouble getting the disks out.  The disks are numbered differently than the Episode season list.  But if you can count,  then there&#8217;s no problem really.  None of that matters much now.  After watching 2 and a half seasons,  I realized that getting the disks out again wouldn&#8217;t really be that big of a deal.  Since every episode is the same it doesn&#8217;t matter which disk you watch,  or which episode.  The acting  and the cast are wonderful.  When I was a kid, I never noticed how in one episode Jeanie was able to do some great magical thing and then later not be able (or not smart enough) to do even some simple thing.  Such as.  When Jeanie makes another Tony,  or more..  Which she did several times.  Yet in another episode,  Neither Jeanie,  nor  Tony,  (who was smart enough to be an astronaut)  could come up with the idea to replace Jeanie&#8217;s favorite slippers with a copy.  If you can copy a whole person,  wouldn&#8217;t making slippers be a simple thing?  No one would have even noticed they were gone in the first place.  These things can be ridiculous if you watch too many episodes in a row.  I bought the complete set,  so the first season is colorized.  I know some don&#8217;t approve of this.  I see nothing wrong with it, since the Black and White version still exists.  Yes, some of the colors were wrong.  Still, it is a lot better than others I have seen.  I don&#8217;t regret buying this complete set.  It still has some great comedy, and worth the price for a complete set.  The show however seems different than it did when viewing it from a child&#8217;s eyes.  It&#8217;s not all I remembered it to be.  Maybe,  &#8220;I dreamed it was better than this.&#8221;",3,99 bottles of Jeanie,1399075200,"05 3, 2014",2014,1969,"['review', 'Dream', 'Jeanie', 'complete', 'set', 'smaller', 'version', 'disks', 'are', 'placed', 'one', 'spindle', 'stacked', 'one', 'top', 'other', 'When', 'first', 'arrived', 'wasn', '8217', 'thrilled', 'packaging', 'thought', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'lot', 'trouble', 'getting', 'disks', 'out', 'disks', 'are', 'numbered', 'differently', 'Episode', 'season', 'list', 'can', 'count', 'then', '8217', 'problem', 'really', 'None', 'matters', 'much', 'now', 'watching', '2', 'half', 'seasons', 'realized', 'getting', 'disks', 'out', 'again', 'wouldn', '8217', 'really', 'be', 'big', 'deal', 'episode', 'same', '8217', 'matter', 'disk', 'watch', 'episode', 'acting', 'cast', 'are', 'wonderful', 'When', 'was', 'kid', 'never', 'noticed', 'how', 'one', 'episode', 'Jeanie', 'was', 'able', 'do', 'great', 'magical', 'thing', 'then', 'later', 'not', 'be', 'able', 'not', 'smart', 'enough', 'do', 'even', 'simple', 'thing', 'Such', 'When', 'Jeanie', 'Tony', 'more..', 'did', 'several', 'times', 'episode', 'Neither', 'Jeanie', 'Tony', 'who', 'was', 'smart', 'enough', 'be', 'astronaut', 'could', 'come', 'up', 'idea', 'replace', 'Jeanie', '8217', 'favorite', 'slippers', 'copy', 'can', 'copy', 'whole', 'person', 'wouldn', '8217', 'making', 'slippers', 'be', 'simple', 'thing', 'one', 'would', 'have', 'even', 'noticed', 'were', 'gone', 'first', 'place', 'things', 'can', 'be', 'ridiculous', 'watch', 'too', 'many', 'episodes', 'row', 'bought', 'complete', 'set', 'first', 'season', 'colorized', 'know', 'don', '8217', 'approve', 'see', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'Black', 'White', 'version', 'still', 'Yes', 'colors', 'were', 'wrong', 'Still', 'lot', 'better', 'others', 'have', 'seen', 'don', '8217', 't', 'buying', 'complete', 'set', 'still', 'great', 'comedy', 'price', 'complete', 'set', 'show', 'however', 'different', 'did', 'when', 'viewing', 'child', '8217', 's', 'eyes', '8217', 'not', 'remembered', 'be', 'Maybe', '8220', 'dreamed', 'was', 'better', 'this.', '8221']",I Dream Of Jeannie Complete DVD Television Series

965003,A39SJ6V6QCGC37,B000E1E7UE,Midge,"[302, 325]","The episodes are great & I want to make it clear that I love this series. I have no complaints with the episodes or the quality of the episodes.The problem is with the functionality of the nightmare packaging, the DVD indexing, the ear-blasting irritating audio on the Menu and inconsistent labeling vs menu designations. I recommend you read this before buying this cute set. You might change your mind and get a set with normal packaging after you read about the nightmare you will go through just to watch the DVD's.The packaging is cute... if you don't ever plan to watch the episodes. However, if you do plan to watch them, when you remove the disk sleeves from the bottle, do NOT set it down because you will end up with disks everywhere. The sleeves cannot be set down because they cannot support themselves upright without the bottle... so it flops over and the disks all fall out. The sleeves are an open accordion/slinky style design, made from thin cardboard. This design is a real pain in the wazoo if you are trying to take out the disks to place them into a DVD player. Since you can't set it down... you have to hold the packaging in one hand while loading the disks into the player with the other hand.Also, the cardboard bottle is very tall, so you need a minimum clearance of 18 inches of height to set down the bottle on the card box as it was designed... so if you have shorter shelf height, it won't fit.The disk labels are all numbered sequentially 1-20. It does show you the season on the label and the sleeves are color coded to separate seasons... but here is the problem. When you load the disks, once you get to disk #5... it is actually season 2 disk #1... so instead of seeing Disk 5 on the menu... you see Disk #1 on the menu. Talk about mismatched numbering schemes between the disk labels and disk screen menu... Really confusing if you have a 5 disk DVD player and see it change from disk 4 to disk 1 (when you were expecting disk 5 like the label).Now that your DVD is loaded... you'd better turn down your sound because you are going to be blasted out of your seat by the opening music volume which is 50 times louder than the episodes. Then when you hear the menu audio music, it plays only a few notes from the theme song then it is abruptly cut off by the loud bang of a snare drum. It does this over and over and over until you stop it. It is really irritating. Especially if the episodes have finished playing and the screen reverts to this menu where you hear a dozen or so notes of the theme song followed by that irritating snare drum bang... over and over again until you put it out of its misery.Now we come to the indexing problem. The entire 1st season's indexing is screwed up... which means you can't skip past the opening credits and theme song on each episode unless you fast forward. If you try to skip to the next scene to bypass the opening theme, you will miss a big chunk of the episode. This is really a nuisance having to fast forward through the theme on every single episode of the entire first season. Evidently, it does not occur to the ""lack of brains"" crew which handled the DVD indexing... that we may not want to watch the opening theme 30 times in a row. The second season seems to be working ok... but we'll see how that goes. I've seen other series like ST-TNG where it goes back and forth from one season to the next. No consistency. By the time I got to disk #5, I was thoroughly irritated enough to write this review while it was all fresh in my mind.Now we come to the little box of cards which the cardboard bottle sits atop. It is like a deck of playing cards for the episodes and only has a short sentence of description about each episode and none about the actors. The same amount of info you will find on Wikipedia. The font is about a 6... so if you are over the age of 40 (which all of the original fans are) you will not be able to read these without some kind of magnification or bifocals. Obviously designed by someone under the age of 30. The cards are cute but totally nonfunctional if you are truly wanting to look for info on the episodes.The colorizing of the B&W; episodes is not as good as on Bewitched, but tolerable. This was done by a lazy (or cheap) colorizer who didn't get inside the mouths and put way too much yellow in her hair. It was almost orange. This was also done by someone under the age of 40 (or someone in a foreign country) who had no clue as to what colors the phones, furnishings, decor, appliances and wall & floor treatments were available in the 60's. All they had to do was to watch a couple of the episodes which were filmed in color... to get the correct colors before they began the colorizing process. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure that out.This might be nitpicking... but things like Orange phones jump out at those of us who lived in the 60's We all know that they didn't have Orange phones in the 60's. Most of the standard phones were either black, white and olive green with some exceptions on the princess and wall phone lines which could be found in baby blue and yellow. The first orange phone I remember wasn't available until around 1980 when they made an Orange overlay template (for either OSU or OU football team colors) for one of the touchtone phone styles.So, if you are buying this set as a cute collectible... it is an adorable design. But if you are planning to watch all of the episodes... this set will be a real pain in the wazoo.",3,Functionality nightmare!

I have already chunked the cardboard lamp and plan on getting an inexpensive binder from Target to store the twenty discs because this is a treasure I want to enjoy for years to come. The transfers are amazing for being as old of TV show this is. Sony did us fans justice by doing such a great job at the transfers (even the early B&W episodes are now looking stunning in color!).

I'm glad to add it to my collection.From reading previous reviews, I believe the original packaging had the DVDs in an accordion style holder within a decorative &#34;Genie&#34; bottle. The new packaging is very basic with the DVDs stacked on a plastic spindle within a folding box/case. I find the DVDs very hard to remove from this spindle because they sit so tightly on the post that they tend to bend when trying to remove. I've found that spinning/twisting the DVD makes it come off okay but you still have to be very careful.Anyway, I am giving this set 5 stars for the content and only 3 stars for the (new) packaging. I give it 2 stars for the closed-captioning...Since there are no English subtitles, you must use composite (yellow [video] & red/white [audio]) analog connections to receive the closed-caption stream. Unfortunately, the closed-caption stream does not pass through a HDMI cable. Newer series and movie releases usually include the (SDH) closed-captioning choice from the menu selections. In this case, this is where the CC stream is encoded within the video stream.Overall, I would still recommend this set for anyone who enjoys Jeannie.

The colorization is done excellently, but to purists it is unwanted. In all honesty, I forgot that the 1st season was in B&W; and failed to check that when ordering; I would have preferred the B&W; first season. On the other hand, if ever a series originally filmed in B&W; deserved colorizing, this is probably it.OK, as for an actual review... the title pretty much sums it up.I loved this series growing up, and I'm happy to have it in my collection.The transfers for the first season, anyway (all I've had time to watch), are excellent and look great on my 52"" LCD using my up-sampling DVD player.The packaging at first glance is impressive, cute, and in keeping with the tone of the series. In that regard, it's excellent. As a practical way to safely store the DVDs, it leaves much to be desired. The packaging consists of a cardboard ""genie bottle"", which is rectangular in cross-section. The DVDs are in a plastic keeper device which is just basically sleeves hinge-joined along one edge (which allows the disks themselves to slip right out) which sits inside the ""bottle"" base. The sides of the bottle are completely open, and the set of disks can -- and do -- fall right out. You can't actually carry the disks inside the bottle, the bottle is entirely for show. The first thing I did upon opening the package and pulling the bottle out was to have the pack of disks fall to the floor. The first time I went to take the bottle off the shelf, even forewarned, I dumped the disks again and caught them on their way down. Thankfully, no damage was done either time. It would have been way better, I think, if the disks were in a closable box and/or if there was a way to keep them from just sliding out of the bottle-box so easily.",4,"Great Series, Excellent Transfers, Cute but Poor Packaging",1252886400,"09 14, 2009",2009,1809,"['Be', 'aware', 'COLORIZED', 'version', 'first', 'season', 'colorization', 'done', 'excellently', 'purists', 'unwanted', 'honesty', 'forgot', '1st', 'season', 'was', 'B', 'W', 'failed', 'check', 'when', 'ordering', 'would', 'have', 'preferred', 'B', 'W', 'first', 'season', 'other', 'hand', 'ever', 'series', 'originally', 'filmed', 'B', 'W', 'deserved', 'colorizing', 'probably', 'it.OK', 'actual', 'review', 'title', 'pretty', 'much', 'sums', 'up.I', 'loved', 'series', 'growing', 'up', ""'m"", 'happy', 'have', 'collection.The', 'transfers', 'first', 'season', 'anyway', ""'ve"", 'had', 'time', 'watch', 'are', 'excellent', 'look', 'great', '52', 'LCD', 'using', 'up-sampling', 'DVD', 'player.The', 'packaging', 'first', 'glance', 'impressive', 'cute', 'keeping', 'tone', 'series', 'regard', 'excellent', 'practical', 'way', 'safely', 'store', 'DVDs', 'much', 'be', 'desired', 'packaging', 'cardboard', 'genie', 'bottle', 'rectangular', 'cross-section', 'DVDs', 'are', 'plastic', 'keeper', 'device', 'just', 'basically', 'hinge-joined', 'one', 'edge', 'disks', 'slip', 'right', 'out', 'bottle', 'base', 'sides', 'bottle', 'are', 'completely', 'open', 'set', 'disks', 'can', 'do', 'fall', 'right', 'out', 'ca', ""n't"", 'actually', 'carry', 'disks', 'bottle', 'bottle', 'entirely', 'show', 'first', 'thing', 'did', 'opening', 'package', 'pulling', 'bottle', 'out', 'was', 'have', 'pack', 'disks', 'fall', 'floor', 'first', 'time', 'went', 'take', 'bottle', 'shelf', 'even', 'forewarned', 'dumped', 'disks', 'again', 'caught', 'way', 'Thankfully', 'damage', 'was', 'done', 'time', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'way', 'better', 'think', 'disks', 'were', 'closable', 'box', 'and/or', 'was', 'way', 'keep', 'just', 'sliding', 'bottle-box', 'easily']",I Dream Of Jeannie Complete DVD Television Series

Just before I ordered this set, I had scarcely seen some reruns on TV and watched a few episodes online.I Dream of Jeannie dropped onto the TV landscape on September 18, 1965 on NBC-TV. This outlandish fantasy-aimed situation comedy was created upon the success of Bewitched, a ABC fantasy, that debuted on September 17, 1964 and had already became the #2 series on TV. I Dream of Jeannie followed the story of a 2,000-year-old genie named Jeannie (Barbara Eden) and astronaut Tony Nelson (Larry Hagman), who meet on a deserted island after Tony's space shuttle crashes. There, he finds a bottle and accidentally lets a foreign-speaking Jeannie out of the bottle. Unbeknownst to Tony, when his rescue crew comes, Jeannie returns to her bottle and places it his bag. When he gets home, Tony discovers Jeannie and their zany misadventures begin. Throughout the rest of the series are Major Roger Healy (Bill Daily), Colonel Dr. Alfred Bellows (Hayden Rorke), and his wife Amanda Bellows (Emmaline Henry).Although not as popular as Bewitched with audiences or critics, I Dream of Jeannie did have a great deal of controversy. Censors haunted production sets because of Barbara Eden's risqu&eacute; two-piece Jeannie Costume. NBC also worried about the concept of the series: a Jeannie willing to do literally ""anything"" for her master. The series went on to have five moderately successful seasons, and from 1965 to 1970, the series was a critical mockery. In the fifth season, when NBC executives only renewed the series unless Jeannie and Tony were married, the show became stupid. Jeannie was unrealistic from the beginning... she was fake. She was a fantasy. How does someone like that get married? They don't. Season five was definitely not the best of the show.As for the box set this series comes in, it looks okay. It's plastic. Mine was tore in some spots and replaced with some cheap tape. The bottle is really nice and looks good, but the DVD holder (20 DVDs) is flimsy and mine was torn on both ends. Also included is a nice box with logo cards (or trading cards or some sort) from all five seasons. They have nice little information and some rare pictures on them. For the price, this set is really not worth it. There is a re-boxing of the complete series coming out in just a few months and the going price is like $35. I'd say buy that. I have not seen any pictures of it yet, but it is supposed to better than this one, especially because all the complaints this one has gotten from fans. Not too satisfying.

Astronaut Tony Nelson (Larry Hagman) is on a space mission that aborts, forcing him to parachute onto a desert island.  While waiting for a rescue team, he finds an old bottle that has washed ashore.  When he opens the bottle, out pops a 2000-year-old, though quite well preserved, genie (Barbara Eden), who promptly regards Tony as her master, since he has set her free.Returning to Florida with the rescue team, Tony soon discovers that no one will believe he has found a voluptuous genie, chalking his claim up to delusions caused by exposure to the elements.  To further complicate matters, the genie, named Jeannie, refuses to perform magic or ever appear for anyone except Tony.  During the last three seasons, Ms. Eden also played Jeannie's wicked twin sister.The 20-disc set includes 139 episodes packaged in a limited- edition genie bottle, audio commentary with the show's stars, interviews with Barbara Eden and Larry Hagman, and collector's cards with photos, episode synopses, trivia, and cast profiles.",4,For the True Jeannie Fan,1226707200,"11 15, 2008",2008,1144,"['Dream', 'Jeannie', 'Complete', 'Series', 'five', 'seasons', 'comedy', 'sitcom', 'premiered', 'September', '1965', 'Astronaut', 'Tony', 'Nelson', 'Larry', 'Hagman', 'space', 'mission', 'forcing', 'parachute', 'desert', 'island', 'waiting', 'rescue', 'team', 'old', 'bottle', 'washed', 'ashore', 'When', 'bottle', '2000-year-old', 'quite', 'well', 'preserved', 'genie', 'Barbara', 'Eden', 'who', 'promptly', 'Tony', 'master', 'set', 'free.Returning', 'Florida', 'rescue', 'team', 'Tony', 'soon', 'one', 'will', 'believe', 'found', 'voluptuous', 'genie', 'chalking', 'claim', 'up', 'delusions', 'caused', 'exposure', 'elements', 'further', 'complicate', 'matters', 'genie', 'named', 'Jeannie', 'perform', 'magic', 'ever', 'appear', 'anyone', 'Tony', 'last', 'three', 'seasons', 'Ms.', 'Eden', 'also', 'played', 'Jeannie', 'wicked', 'twin', 'sister.The', '20-disc', 'set', '139', 'episodes', 'packaged', 'limited-', 'edition', 'genie', 'bottle', 'audio', 'commentary', 'show', 'stars', 'interviews', 'Barbara', 'Eden', 'Larry', 'Hagman', 'collector', 'cards', 'photos', 'episode', 'synopses', 'trivia', 'cast', 'profiles']",I Dream Of Jeannie Complete DVD Television Series
