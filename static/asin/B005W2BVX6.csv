1504347,A2PUJLP9KCRNIE,B005W2BVX6,Ed,"[0, 0]",My Bride is a Mermaid is in my opionon very cool and fun. I mean here you see a young boy getting saved by a beautful mermaid then he has to marry her or else die. I mean the way they did the expressions for the characters is hilarious. I think they should make a season 2 because it would be interesting to see how things have changed with lunar and the others.,5,Funny and cool,1351814400,"11 2, 2012",2012,362,"['Bride', 'Mermaid', 'opionon', 'very', 'cool', 'fun', 'mean', 'here', 'see', 'young', 'boy', 'getting', 'saved', 'beautful', 'mermaid', 'then', 'marry', 'else', 'die', 'mean', 'way', 'did', 'expressions', 'characters', 'hilarious', 'think', 'should', 'make', 'season', '2', 'would', 'be', 'interesting', 'see', 'how', 'things', 'have', 'changed', 'lunar', 'others']",My Bride Is a Mermaid: Complete Collection

The anime itself is 26 episodes long and it is great to have the entire series in 1 boxset. (Good for collections).

1504354,A34WKS12PJ9DEC,B005W2BVX6,Scoots McBoots,"[0, 0]","This is one of the funniest anime I have seen in a while! The expressions they draw for the characters are priceless, the jokes are over the top and hyperbole abounds. This show covers about any awkward relationship situation there is and does it well and keeps the jokes fresh while doing so. I picked this up as an impulse buy just to see what it was since it was on sale at the time. I'm glad I did! It turns out that gangsters, mermaids, and teen angst make a good recipe for absolute wackiness. I have already re-watched it once, which I usually don't do soon after finishing a series for the first time. If you want a break from serious character, story driven anime pick this up, hit play and get set for a fun time. Definitely a nice series to have sitting in your collection to pull out from time to time as a palate cleanser or a good laugh.",5,"Yeah, this is hilarious",1351641600,"10 31, 2012",2012,851,"['one', 'funniest', 'anime', 'have', 'seen', 'while', 'expressions', 'draw', 'characters', 'are', 'priceless', 'jokes', 'are', 'top', 'hyperbole', 'abounds', 'show', 'awkward', 'relationship', 'situation', 'well', 'jokes', 'fresh', 'doing', 'so', 'picked', 'up', 'impulse', 'buy', 'just', 'see', 'what', 'was', 'was', 'sale', 'time', ""'m"", 'glad', 'did', 'out', 'gangsters', 'mermaids', 'teen', 'angst', 'make', 'good', 'recipe', 'absolute', 'wackiness', 'have', 'already', 're-watched', 'once', 'usually', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'soon', 'finishing', 'series', 'first', 'time', 'want', 'break', 'serious', 'character', 'story', 'driven', 'anime', 'pick', 'up', 'hit', 'play', 'get', 'set', 'fun', 'time', 'Definitely', 'nice', 'series', 'have', 'sitting', 'collection', 'pull', 'out', 'time', 'time', 'palate', 'cleanser', 'good', 'laugh']",My Bride Is a Mermaid: Complete Collection
