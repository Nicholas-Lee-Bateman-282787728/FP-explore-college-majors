There are frequent,fast, rotational-type movements that are not good for the knees.  May be a good workout for those with dance experience, but it is too complicated (and ineffective due to the effort lost from missing steps) for those of us who never had formal dance training.",2,Not For Weak Knees,1111622400,"03 24, 2005",2005,353,"['found', 'pace', 'too', 'fast', 'follow', 'complicated', 'dance-like', 'movements', 'are', 'frequent', 'fast', 'rotational-type', 'movements', 'are', 'not', 'good', 'knees', 'May', 'be', 'good', 'workout', 'dance', 'experience', 'too', 'complicated', 'ineffective', 'due', 'effort', 'lost', 'missing', 'steps', 'who', 'never', 'had', 'formal', 'dance', 'training']",Target Toning: Buns and Abs of Steel
815855,A26IPZJ4OA05RU,B0001WTX64,Food Fan,"[14, 19]","See the other reviews about the BUNS section.Here's what I think about the ABS section:If you are a beginner that likes eighties music(Gloria Estefan, Madonna, etc), then you may want to give this video a try.  Otherwise don't waste your time and money(Instead, I would recommend the much more effective ""Firm Parts 5-Day Abs"" and ""more 5 day abs"".)This Buns of Steel video is very boring.  The motions don't really fit the songs they picked, so it feels like you're doing a few randomly timed moves to cheesy background music.This video isn't that intense of a workout (even though the instructor claims that this is the toughest ab workout in the world). There aren't that many reps of any particular movement, and there is also a lot of time wasted doing motions that don't work the abs.For example, it starts out with about 10 minutes of doing Marching in place & Step-Touches (while flinging arms), interspersed with several random squats and lunges.Then there is about 20 minutes of the following (overall not that intense, unless you are a beginner):Leg lifts in front while standing up (this works the hip flexors more than the abs)Crunch variationsBridge position and lift 1 leg up  (this is a great butt exercises, but doesn't do much for the abs)Reverse crunchPush upsLift body facing floor (I don't see how this works the abs  or any other muscles for that matter)PlankLeg lifts while laying down (works hip flexors and front of thighs)Oblique twists w/ Bicycle legsLeg lifts w/ crunchOblique twistSide leg kick (this is a great hip exercise)It ends with a few stretches.",3,"ok if you're an 80's beginner, but not great",1163289600,"11 12, 2006",2006,1583,"['See', 'other', 'reviews', 'BUNS', 'what', 'think', 'ABS', 'section', 'are', 'beginner', 'eighties', 'music', 'Gloria', 'Estefan', 'Madonna', 'etc', 'then', 'may', 'want', 'give', 'video', 'try', 'Otherwise', 'do', ""n't"", 'waste', 'time', 'money', 'Instead', 'would', 'recommend', 'much', 'more', 'effective', 'Firm', '5-Day', 'Abs', 'more', '5', 'day', 'abs', 'Buns', 'Steel', 'video', 'very', 'boring', 'motions', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'fit', 'songs', 'picked', ""'re"", 'doing', 'few', 'randomly', 'timed', 'moves', 'cheesy', 'background', 'music.This', 'video', ""n't"", 'intense', 'workout', 'even', 'instructor', 'toughest', 'ab', 'workout', 'world', 'are', ""n't"", 'many', 'reps', 'particular', 'movement', 'also', 'lot', 'time', 'wasted', 'doing', 'motions', 'do', ""n't"", 'work', 'abs.For', 'example', 'out', 'about', '10', 'minutes', 'doing', 'Marching', 'place', 'Step-Touches', 'flinging', 'arms', 'interspersed', 'several', 'random', 'squats', 'lunges.Then', '20', 'minutes', 'following', 'overall', 'not', 'intense', 'are', 'beginner', 'Leg', 'lifts', 'front', 'standing', 'up', 'hip', 'flexors', 'more', 'abs', 'Crunch', 'variationsBridge', 'position', 'lift', '1', 'leg', 'up', 'great', 'butt', 'exercises', ""n't"", 'do', 'much', 'abs', 'Reverse', 'crunchPush', 'upsLift', 'body', 'facing', 'floor', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'how', 'abs', 'other', 'muscles', 'matter', 'PlankLeg', 'lifts', 'laying', 'down', 'works', 'hip', 'flexors', 'front', 'thighs', 'Oblique', 'twists', 'w/', 'Bicycle', 'legsLeg', 'lifts', 'w/', 'crunchOblique', 'twistSide', 'leg', 'kick', 'great', 'hip', 'exercise', 'few', 'stretches']",Target Toning: Buns and Abs of Steel

The workouts are great for both the abs and buns however I think the buns might be harder to do then Abs. But I feel great when I work out to Both and I always notice nice changes to my body as I continue the work outs on a weekly bases!,5,My favorite work outs,1176076800,"04 9, 2007",2007,371,"['DVD', 'great', 'actually', 'got', 'VHS', 'mid', '90', 'good', 'know', 'can', 'purchase', 'Abs', 'Buns', 'same', 'dvd', 'workouts', 'are', 'great', 'abs', 'however', 'think', 'buns', 'might', 'be', 'harder', 'do', 'then', 'Abs', 'feel', 'great', 'when', 'work', 'out', 'always', 'notice', 'nice', 'changes', 'body', 'continue', 'work', 'weekly', 'bases']",Target Toning: Buns and Abs of Steel

815858,AVIMI43QBLO81,B0001WTX64,Valerie M.,"[0, 0]","I had the Abs of Steel workout on VHS tape until it was destroyed in my last move. I love this workout. It has a great deal of variety, so I don't get bored doing the same repetitive move over and over. When I was in my dancing prime, it was more like a warm-up, but appropriately effective. Now that I've been a few years from active dancing, I can still keep up. It's also nice that they keep pace with the music, so all the steps and pulses are in time. The Abs workout is 1/3 upright and 2/3 floor work. It's not too hard on the knees. One of the best parts is that the ladies are all smiles, and the music is upbeat. It's a happy workout. I give this part 5 stars.The Buns workout is not as fun for me. It's all upright, and basically 30 minutes of squats. There isn't a lot of variety to the moves, so it gets boring really fast. Honestly, I've never made it all the way through, because I get bored. I usually switch to another video. Also, because most of the exercises are squat-based, it can be hard on the knees. There are some good moves in there, and some nice techniques, so it's worth going through to build a repertoire of exercises. After adoring the Abs video so much, this one was a sore disappointment.Robin rocks. She's so cheerful. I'd totally work out with her every day.",4,"Love the Abs video, but the Buns is repetitive",1388102400,"12 27, 2013",2013,1294,"['had', 'Abs', 'Steel', 'workout', 'VHS', 'tape', 'was', 'destroyed', 'last', 'move', 'love', 'workout', 'great', 'deal', 'variety', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'bored', 'doing', 'same', 'repetitive', 'move', 'over', 'When', 'was', 'dancing', 'prime', 'was', 'more', 'warm-up', 'appropriately', 'effective', 'Now', ""'ve"", 'been', 'few', 'years', 'active', 'dancing', 'can', 'still', 'keep', 'up', 'also', 'nice', 'keep', 'pace', 'music', 'steps', 'pulses', 'are', 'time', 'Abs', 'workout', '1/3', 'upright', '2/3', 'floor', 'work', 'not', 'too', 'hard', 'knees', 'One', 'best', 'parts', 'ladies', 'are', 'smiles', 'music', 'upbeat', 'happy', 'workout', 'give', 'part', '5', 'stars.The', 'Buns', 'workout', 'not', 'fun', 'upright', 'basically', '30', 'minutes', 'squats', ""n't"", 'lot', 'variety', 'moves', 'boring', 'really', 'fast', 'Honestly', ""'ve"", 'never', 'made', 'way', 'get', 'bored', 'usually', 'switch', 'video', 'Also', 'most', 'exercises', 'are', 'squat-based', 'can', 'be', 'hard', 'knees', 'are', 'good', 'moves', 'there', 'nice', 'techniques', 'worth', 'going', 'build', 'repertoire', 'exercises', 'adoring', 'Abs', 'video', 'so', 'much', 'one', 'was', 'sore', 'disappointment.Robin', 'rocks', 'so', 'cheerful', ""'d"", 'totally', 'work', 'out', 'day']",Target Toning: Buns and Abs of Steel
