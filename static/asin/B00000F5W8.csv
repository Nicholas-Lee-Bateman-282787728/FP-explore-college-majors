499113,A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ,B00000F5W8,"Barry ""Barrybgb""","[12, 14]","In 1987, a little show called Married With Children on a little network called FOX, made it's debut and in the process made it's mark on the sitcom genre. The first season was a mid season replacement consisting of only 12 episodes. While the ratings were poor, and the network wasn't quite a network yet, the show struck a nerve and stuck around. Now, we get season 2. The first full season and where the show really started to come into it's own. The tone had been set and the actors had settled into their roles. Season 2 is a vast improvement over season 1, since that season was pretty short and still trying to find it's feet. While I said in my season one review all that really needed to be said about the show, it's characters, and why it was so successful and liked, I'll just stick to the episodes at hand in this season box set. It begins with a two part episode called ""Poppy's By The Tree"". To me, this is classic Bundy. I have always loved these two episodes and it was around this time that I started watching, so they have great sentimental value to me. ""If I Were A Rich Man"", finds Steve realizing that a million dollars is missing from the bank and he thinks Al took it. Not a great ep. ""Buck Can Do It"" is a classic episode that has the family wanting Buck The Dog neutered, but Al can't bring himself to it. A riot!. Another two parter, ""Girls Just Want To Have Fun"", finds Marcy losing her ring down a stripper's pants while out with Peg. Great two parter. ""Alley Of The Dolls"" is another classic ep that finds The Bundy's in a bowling match with Peg's old high school rival. ""You Better Watch Out"" is one of the biggest Bundy classics, when a department store Santa crash lands in the Bundy backyard. ""Just Married...With Children"" is a keeper. Al and Peg go on a game show disguised as Steve and Marcy, but you have to endure torture in order to win. The season finale, ""All In The Family"", features appearances by Peg's, shall we say, less than stellar family. There are a lot more episodes here, but these are the best. ""The Razor's Edge"" and ""Earth Angel"", also fall in there. Not that the season didn't have it's share of duds, because it did. Eps like ""Father Lode"", where Al tries to keep his race track winnings from Peg, ""The Great Escape"", which had the family moving into the shoe store after having a termite problem at home and it ruins Kelly's plans to go to a rock concert, ""Master The Possibilities"", which founds a credit card coming in the mail for dog Buck and the family using it to their fullest advantage, and ""How Do You Spell Revenge"", which had Al trying to improve Peg's softball skills and Kelly's boyfriend wanting her to get a tatoo to proclaim her love for him, were below average. The cast as I said before, have grown into their roles. Ed 'O' Neill was different as Al in the beginning. He had a New Jersey kind of tough guy accent, but he was become the Al we know here. The rest of the cast have easily dissolved into their individual characters here as well. The show was still a little low in the ratings, but it had gained a bit more momentum this season than in the previous year. That would change even more when a housewife from the mid-west made a stink over the content of the show and tried to get it cancelled, but it resulted in making the show even more popular and gave it a huge spike in the ratings. The show got better than season 2, but this sophomore season really got the show rolling.",5,A Man's Pants Is His Castle,1075680000,"02 2, 2004",2004,3462,"['1987', 'little', 'show', 'called', 'Married', 'Children', 'little', 'network', 'called', 'FOX', 'made', 'debut', 'process', 'made', 'mark', 'sitcom', 'genre', 'first', 'season', 'was', 'mid', 'season', 'replacement', 'consisting', 'only', '12', 'episodes', 'ratings', 'were', 'poor', 'network', 'was', ""n't"", 'quite', 'network', 'yet', 'show', 'struck', 'nerve', 'stuck', 'around', 'Now', 'get', 'season', '2', 'first', 'full', 'season', 'where', 'show', 'really', 'started', 'come', 'own', 'tone', 'had', 'been', 'set', 'actors', 'had', 'settled', 'roles', 'Season', '2', 'vast', 'improvement', 'season', '1', 'season', 'was', 'pretty', 'short', 'still', 'trying', 'find', 'feet', 'said', 'season', 'one', 'review', 'really', 'needed', 'be', 'said', 'show', 'characters', 'why', 'was', 'so', 'successful', 'liked', ""'ll"", 'just', 'stick', 'episodes', 'hand', 'season', 'box', 'set', 'two', 'part', 'episode', 'called', 'Poppy', 'Tree', 'classic', 'Bundy', 'have', 'always', 'loved', 'two', 'episodes', 'was', 'time', 'started', 'watching', 'have', 'great', 'sentimental', 'value', 'Were', 'Rich', 'Man', 'Steve', 'realizing', 'million', 'dollars', 'missing', 'bank', 'Al', 'took', 'Not', 'great', 'ep', 'Buck', 'Can', 'Do', 'classic', 'episode', 'family', 'wanting', 'Buck', 'Dog', 'neutered', 'Al', 'ca', ""n't"", 'bring', 'riot', 'two', 'parter', 'Girls', 'Just', 'Want', 'Have', 'Fun', 'Marcy', 'losing', 'ring', 'down', 'stripper', 'pants', 'out', 'Peg', 'Great', 'two', 'parter', 'Alley', 'Dolls', 'classic', 'ep', 'Bundy', 'bowling', 'match', 'Peg', 'old', 'high', 'school', 'rival', 'Better', 'Watch', 'Out', 'one', 'biggest', 'Bundy', 'classics', 'when', 'department', 'store', 'Santa', 'crash', 'lands', 'Bundy', 'backyard', 'Just', 'Married', 'Children', 'keeper', 'Al', 'Peg', 'go', 'game', 'show', 'disguised', 'Steve', 'Marcy', 'have', 'endure', 'torture', 'order', 'win', 'season', 'finale', 'Family', 'features', 'appearances', 'Peg', 'shall', 'say', 'less', 'stellar', 'family', 'are', 'lot', 'more', 'episodes', 'here', 'are', 'best', 'Razor', 'Edge', 'Earth', 'Angel', 'also', 'fall', 'there', 'Not', 'season', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'share', 'duds', 'did', 'Eps', 'Father', 'Lode', 'where', 'Al', 'keep', 'race', 'track', 'winnings', 'Peg', 'Great', 'Escape', 'had', 'family', 'moving', 'shoe', 'store', 'having', 'termite', 'problem', 'home', 'Kelly', 'plans', 'go', 'rock', 'concert', 'Master', 'Possibilities', 'credit', 'card', 'coming', 'mail', 'dog', 'Buck', 'family', 'using', 'fullest', 'advantage', 'How', 'Do', 'Spell', 'Revenge', 'had', 'Al', 'trying', 'improve', 'Peg', 'softball', 'skills', 'Kelly', 'boyfriend', 'wanting', 'get', 'tatoo', 'proclaim', 'love', 'were', 'below', 'average', 'cast', 'said', 'have', 'grown', 'roles', 'Ed', 'O', 'Neill', 'was', 'different', 'Al', 'beginning', 'had', 'New', 'Jersey', 'kind', 'tough', 'guy', 'accent', 'was', 'become', 'Al', 'know', 'here', 'rest', 'cast', 'have', 'easily', 'dissolved', 'individual', 'characters', 'here', 'as', 'well', 'show', 'was', 'still', 'little', 'low', 'ratings', 'had', 'gained', 'bit', 'more', 'momentum', 'season', 'previous', 'year', 'would', 'change', 'even', 'more', 'when', 'housewife', 'mid-west', 'made', 'stink', 'content', 'show', 'tried', 'get', 'cancelled', 'resulted', 'making', 'show', 'even', 'more', 'popular', 'gave', 'huge', 'spike', 'ratings', 'show', 'got', 'better', 'season', '2', 'sophomore', 'season', 'really', 'got', 'show', 'rolling']",Married... with Children: Season 2

This was his last year on the show.MWC's 2nd season had 22 episodes, including Poppy's by the Tree(a snippy commentary on Florida, showing a steamy hotel where an axe murderer is accepted because he met a minor celebrity), Earth Angel(son Bud brings home a hitchhiker that drives the neighborhood men crazy), Guys and Dolls(childhoods revisited), the Great Escape(camping out in the shoe store), and Just Married with Children (the Bundy's intercept an invitation for the neighbors to go on a TV game show).Looking at the episodes in total, this is definitely a good, middle-of-the-road, season, with no great episodes and a few that were merely so-so.  Although Steve was a fine comedic actor, his departure actually revived the show, as later years recovered the 'bounce' of the 1st year, driving the series to continue for over a decade.To sum up, if you are getting the entire series, the whole series is finally out and affordable.

499118,AY69ZK7G6CNYJ,B00000F5W8,"Britt Gillette ""thedvdreport.blogspot.com""","[0, 0]","First premiering in April 1987, Married With Children became a staple of the growing Fox Network's original prime time programming, paving the way for further original creations such as The Simpsons. The total opposite of what a TV family should be, the original working title for the show was Not The Cosbys (a reference to the perfect family atmosphere of the popular 80's sitcom The Cosby Show). Paving the way for ABC's Roseanne, Married With Children more than lived up to its working title, chronicling the pathetic life of a Chicago shoe salesman and his equally dysfunctional family...Married With Children follows the exploits of the Bundy family, a dysfunctional trailer-park trash family living in American suburbia. The family is headed by Al Bundy (Ed O'Neill), a shoe salesman who's lewd, crude, sarcastic, and completely dissatisfied with his life as a loser. Al's wife Peg (Katey Sagal) spends her days watching Oprah and spending what little money Al brings home (she's also Al's greatest source of annoyance). Al and Peg's lives are complicated by their children, Kelly (Christina Applegate), a beautiful yet stupid teenager, and Bud (David Faustino), a sex-starved adolescent. With neighbors Steve (David Garrison), Marcy (Amanda Bearse), and Jefferson (Ted McGinley) dropping in on a regular basis, Al's dreams of a normal family life or a spare moment to relax are continually interrupted by the tortuous reality of his mediocre existence...The Married With Children (Season 2) DVD features a number of hilarious episodes including the season premiere ""Poppy's by the Tree"" in which the Bundys head off on their version of a family vacation. While at a sleazy motel in Dumpwater, Florida, they cross paths with a serial killer who loathes tourists. When the killer kidnaps Peg, it's all up to Al to save her life... Other notable episodes from Season 2 include ""Born to Walk"" in which Al fails the test for his driver's license renewal on the same day that his ditzy daughter Kelly passes, and ""Build a Better Mousetrap"" in which Al nearly destroys the Bundy household in pursuit of an invading rodent...Below is a list of episodes included on the Married With Children (Season 2) DVD:Episode 14 (Poppy's By the Tree: Part 1)Episode 15 (Poppy's By the Tree: Part 2)Episode 16 (If I Were a Rich Man)Episode 17 (Buck Can Do It)Episode 18 (Girls Just Want To Have Fun: Part 1)Episode 19 (Girls Just Want To Have Fun: Part 2)Episode 20 (For Whom the Bell Tolls)Episode 21 (Born to Walk)Episode 22 (Alley of the Dolls)Episode 23 (The Razor's Edge)Episode 24 (How Do You Spell Revenge?)Episode 25 (Earth Angel)Episode 26 (You Better Watch Out)Episode 27 (Guys and Dolls)Episode 28 (Build a Better Mousetrap)Episode 29 (Master the Possibilities)Episode 30 (Peggy Loves Al, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah)Episode 31 (The Great Escape)Episode 32 (Im-Po-Dent)Episode 33 (Just Married...

With Children"" and the two parter ""Poppy's by the Tree"". It's also great to see the development of the characters through the vehicle of dvd sets. It may sound funny, but this was one show that truly evolved through the years.What hurt this dvd set, isn't the writing, or anything to do with the show. The producers once again failed to leave any assurance for the fan base that literally embraced the show through its eleven year run. Ironically, this show was canned by Fox the same abrupt way. This show made the network into the staple it is today and it feels like it hasn't gotten the true treatment it deserves.Just like season one, the second season was without a doubt great television that poked fun at the serious side of life. For those who took it for what it was worth and could laugh at ourselves as a society. I say, enjoy The Bundys.

It's amusing that Kelly is pretty smart in the early going of the series. She's much funnier an airhead of course, can't wait 'til that happens. Bud is getting funnier and funnier. And Al & Peg already have their characters down pretty early in the series which is great!PICTURE QUALITY:Discs 1 and 2 for some moronic reason are loaded with NINE episodes each, and the 3rd with only FOUR. Stupid enough for any of you? Yes, these filthy rich companies can't even add for some reason. Does no one check the product before it is released?Many episodes, especially on the 2nd disk, are plagued with LINES  ON THE SCREEN. A single, translucent vertical line just hangs on the screen in the same place for a few seconds at a time, disappearing then returning, in several episodes (and no, it's not my dvd player or my tv to blame). This is VERY annoying. The 3rd disc, SURPRISE SURPRISE, suffers NO such defects, and the picture is brilliant. I can only attribute these flaws to OVER-COMPRESSION.DVD PRODUCER'S THOUGHTS: Hmmm. Let's see. 22 episodes on 3 discs. I know! Let's overload the first 2 discs with 9 eps each and leave the third one virtually empty with only 4! It makes perfect sense!Couldn't they just have done 8+7+7 instead of 9+9+4? DUH???THE EXTRAS:Terrible. The ""extras"" are pathetic easter eggs hidden in menu screens you have to search for like a moron.

499131,A2EERM752BMSQD,B00000F5W8,just some guy,"[3, 4]","We need more people reviewing these DVD sets AFTER they've actually bought them. It's easy to review the show and say how great it was, but what about the quality of the DVDs, what about the extra features? Fine, the second season of Married With Children gets 4 out of 5 stars. It's a slight improvement over the first season, and still beats out some of the goofier/sillier/cartoonish later seasons (you know, for example, like where they show episodes about Kelly landing her own TV show in Hollywood, or where Al sees Aliens stealing his socks - the sort of outlandish - but still hilarious - stuff you'd NEVER see in these early seasons of the series).As for the DVDs themselves, they're average looking. They aren't what you'd expect of top quality DVDs, but they are serviceable. It's not like you're expecting to watch a widescreen presentation of some awesome sci-fi or fantasy show that dwells on visuals. This is just a comedy, meant for laughs, and what you're seeing on these discs is better than what you'd record on VHS. They squeeze 22 episodes onto 3 discs, which is a tight fit. So there's noticeable compression in the overall look of the show, plus it's grainy and blurry at various times. But it's not so noticeable that it takes you out of the stories. You soon lose yourself in the laughter and forget about the so-so look of the picture.The much talked about easter egg ""bonus features"" are simply unaired portions of the cast talking during the reunion special they aired in early 2003. Most of the clips are short, between 30 seconds to a minute. Sometimes it's interesting, sometimes it's like, ""Huh?"" But I hated the easter egg idea. It's not fun when you goof around with your remote looking for a specific clip, and then you are ""rewarded"" with a quick 30 seconds or so of cast members talking over each other in a chaotic way about what they thought of the show. Yikes. Stop with the easter eggs. No more! Just place any special features in the menu in a regular way in the future, thank you!Oh, did I mention they include on the DVD a bunch of advertisements for other shows?

I picked this up the afternoon it came out, went home, and have been enjoying it over the past few nights. It brings back so much of what TV doesn't have today: great sitcoms that make you laugh. You didn't have to think when you watched the Bundy's, you just had to laugh. Tang Wipes, the physical humor, and how can you not laugh at Buck? The hidden easter eggs are outtakes from the reunion special, and while there are quite a few, most are just uninteresting. But the episodes are great. Especially the one where Al and Steve go looking for Marcies Barbie. Just the montage with the Glen Frey song ""you belong to the city"" is worth the whole price of the set.

That's what it was hyped on, and that is what we must expect - AND GET.Columbia/Sony's TV season releases are sub-par, especially in video quality.I'm not here to praise the show.  In its earlier years (the ""Steve Rhoades"" era) the show was funniest.  Or maybe the Ted McGinley era was better.  I dunno.  Most seasons had their share of great episodes.  But I taped a lot of MWC.  Why should I buy the DVD, for $30?  What should I be getting?While it's nice to see company's logos look crisp and clear, it becomes a disappointment to see fuzzy TV show afterward.  (there is a big difference between the quality of the master tapes/film and the transfer quality.  The latter pertains to how the DVD image looks on your screen.  Master tape quality is the condition of the tape  (a degrading studio tape looks far different than a poor DVD transfer).  Many tools and tricks are used to restore picture and sound quality, but all of that time and money spent to clean the episodes by the company is wasted if the DVD transfer is poor.)Pity I can't post pics...Season 1 wasn't all that great.  For Columbia, it's pretty much standard.  Bog standard.I refuse to buy another Columbia/Sony TV series on DVD until they clean up their act OR make their prices reasonable.  Not for the amount of money customers spend...  (and just wait until you see these on HDTV...)  Should Good Times season 2 be $30?  Try $15.  MWC season 2 being $34?  Try $15 instead.  Three's Company season 1 being $13?  Try $6.  OR give consumers and fans of these shows some RESPECT and push out high quality releases.  We work for a living and if we don't put out good material, we get fired and blacklisted.  Why should you expect any different treatment?Why is it that FOX will release a season's worth of TV shows, with extras, and make them look clean and crisp - whereas Columbia's look like near-VHS quality?  (Okay, it's better than VHS in some shots, but all in all it's not better enough to be enthused about.)These shows more than made up their money via the original sponsors airtimes and syndication reruns.  MWC made MILLIONS.  Surely you'd think that the owner would take a little care for the sake of their fans?  How much extra does a disc cost?  Or a dual-layer disc?!  Squeezing 9 episodes onto one disc instantly tells me ""crud quality""; especially when I've seen Columbia release series (Good Times, The Critic, etc) with 8 eps per disc and they look mediocre~fair.)  Sheesh, even ""Family Guy"", with 8 eps per disc, still look stunning (dual layer discs).Hey, Paramount improved their act.  FOX was great to start with.  It's Columbia's turn to show they've got guts.I refuse to be taken to the cleaners any longer.  I'm not that desperate to replace VHS with... well... VHS.I will asy this in this set's favor:  13 easter eggs, each revealing an interview.  It's a nice thought, especially if the interviews were worth it, but I much prefer to see the eps in good condition.",1,What is the point of DVD?,1079395200,"03 16, 2004",2004,2990,"['Better', 'picture', 'sound', 'what', 'was', 'hyped', 'what', 'must', 'expect', 'GET.Columbia/Sony', 'TV', 'season', 'releases', 'are', 'sub-par', 'especially', 'video', 'quality.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'here', 'praise', 'show', 'earlier', 'years', 'Steve', 'Rhoades', 'era', 'show', 'was', 'funniest', 'maybe', 'Ted', 'McGinley', 'era', 'was', 'better', 'dunno', 'Most', 'seasons', 'had', 'share', 'great', 'episodes', 'taped', 'lot', 'MWC', 'Why', 'should', 'buy', 'DVD', '30', 'What', 'should', 'be', 'getting', 'nice', 'see', 'company', 'logos', 'look', 'crisp', 'clear', 'disappointment', 'see', 'fuzzy', 'TV', 'show', 'afterward', 'big', 'difference', 'quality', 'master', 'tapes/film', 'transfer', 'quality', 'latter', 'pertains', 'how', 'DVD', 'image', 'screen', 'Master', 'tape', 'quality', 'condition', 'tape', 'degrading', 'studio', 'tape', 'far', 'different', 'poor', 'DVD', 'transfer', 'Many', 'tools', 'tricks', 'are', 'used', 'restore', 'picture', 'sound', 'quality', 'time', 'money', 'spent', 'clean', 'episodes', 'company', 'wasted', 'DVD', 'transfer', 'poor', 'Pity', 'ca', ""n't"", 'post', 'pics', 'Season', '1', 'was', ""n't"", 'great', 'Columbia', 'pretty', 'much', 'standard', 'Bog', 'standard.I', 'refuse', 'buy', 'Columbia/Sony', 'TV', 'series', 'DVD', 'clean', 'up', 'act', 'OR', 'make', 'prices', 'reasonable', 'Not', 'amount', 'money', 'customers', 'spend', 'just', 'wait', 'see', 'HDTV', 'Should', 'Good', 'Times', 'season', '2', 'be', '30', 'Try', '15', 'MWC', 'season', '2', 'being', '34', 'Try', '15', 'instead', 'Three', 'Company', 'season', '1', 'being', '13', 'Try', '6', 'give', 'consumers', 'fans', 'shows', 'RESPECT', 'push', 'out', 'high', 'quality', 'releases', 'work', 'living', 'do', ""n't"", 'put', 'out', 'good', 'material', 'get', 'fired', 'blacklisted', 'Why', 'should', 'expect', 'different', 'treatment', 'Why', 'FOX', 'will', 'release', 'season', 'worth', 'TV', 'shows', 'extras', 'make', 'look', 'clean', 'crisp', 'Columbia', 'look', 'near-VHS', 'quality', 'Okay', 'better', 'VHS', 'shots', 'not', 'better', 'enough', 'be', 'enthused', 'more', 'made', 'up', 'money', 'original', 'sponsors', 'airtimes', 'syndication', 'reruns', 'MWC', 'made', 'MILLIONS', 'Surely', ""'d"", 'think', 'owner', 'would', 'take', 'little', 'care', 'sake', 'fans', 'How', 'much', 'extra', 'disc', 'cost', 'dual-layer', 'disc', 'Squeezing', '9', 'episodes', 'one', 'disc', 'instantly', 'crud', 'quality', 'especially', 'when', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Columbia', 'release', 'series', 'Good', 'Times', 'Critic', 'etc', '8', 'eps', 'disc', 'look', 'mediocre~fair', 'Sheesh', 'even', 'Family', 'Guy', '8', 'eps', 'disc', 'still', 'look', 'stunning', 'dual', 'layer', 'discs', '.Hey', 'Paramount', 'improved', 'act', 'FOX', 'was', 'great', 'start', 'Columbia', 'turn', 'show', ""'ve"", 'got', 'guts.I', 'refuse', 'be', 'taken', 'cleaners', 'longer', ""'m"", 'not', 'desperate', 'replace', 'VHS', 'well', 'VHS.I', 'will', 'asy', 'set', 'favor', '13', 'easter', 'eggs', 'revealing', 'interview', 'nice', 'thought', 'especially', 'interviews', 'were', 'worth', 'much', 'prefer', 'see', 'eps', 'good', 'condition']",Married... with Children: Season 2
