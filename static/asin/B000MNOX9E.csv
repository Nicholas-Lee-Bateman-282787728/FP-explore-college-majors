1047881,A3N6GAJTEOF4MO,B000MNOX9E,Caleb Williams,"[0, 0]","I'm actually shocked that considering the stellar voice cast, this movie wasn't released in cinemas worldwide or received a higher level of recognition. I have to be honest, this movie was just really great, in a sense that I can stick it on and my 13 month old niece would sit in silence for the entire movie and enjoy it. Any movie that can achieve such a feat is alright with me. It's no Pixar masterpiece (which I guess the comparison had to be inevitable with such a movie) but it is in a great league of its own.The story is set in 1920's New York and focuses around Baseball fan Yankee Irving. He's someone who idolises the legendary Babe Ruth and one day hopes to be as great as he is. One day after another game of Baseball with his friends, he finds a talking Baseball (Rob Reiner) which he calls Screwie. Yankee visits his Dad at the Yankee stadium where he works and his Dad treats him to a tour around the Yankees locker room. The next day the Yankees manager and a police officer visit the Yankee home as the lucky Baseball bat of Babe Ruths has been stolen. This leads to Yankees Dad being fired, but Yankee knows who stole the bat. So he sets on an adventure to find out who really stole the bat and get his dad his job back.An overall great movie that I honestly feel should have got more recognition than it did.",5,A Sweet And Lighthearted Picture,1218844800,"08 16, 2008",2008,1330,"[""'m"", 'actually', 'shocked', 'considering', 'stellar', 'voice', 'cast', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'released', 'cinemas', 'worldwide', 'received', 'higher', 'level', 'recognition', 'have', 'be', 'honest', 'movie', 'was', 'just', 'really', 'great', 'sense', 'can', 'stick', '13', 'month', 'old', 'niece', 'would', 'sit', 'silence', 'entire', 'movie', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'can', 'achieve', 'feat', 'alright', 'Pixar', 'masterpiece', 'guess', 'comparison', 'had', 'be', 'inevitable', 'movie', 'great', 'league', 'own.The', 'story', 'set', '1920', 'New', 'York', 'Baseball', 'fan', 'Yankee', 'Irving', 'someone', 'who', 'legendary', 'Babe', 'Ruth', 'one', 'day', 'be', 'as', 'great', 'One', 'day', 'game', 'Baseball', 'friends', 'talking', 'Baseball', 'Rob', 'Reiner', 'Screwie', 'Dad', 'Yankee', 'stadium', 'where', 'Dad', 'tour', 'Yankees', 'locker', 'room', 'next', 'day', 'Yankees', 'manager', 'police', 'officer', 'visit', 'Yankee', 'home', 'lucky', 'Baseball', 'bat', 'Babe', 'Ruths', 'been', 'stolen', 'Yankees', 'Dad', 'being', 'fired', 'Yankee', 'knows', 'who', 'stole', 'bat', 'adventure', 'find', 'out', 'who', 'really', 'stole', 'bat', 'get', 'dad', 'job', 'back.An', 'overall', 'great', 'movie', 'honestly', 'feel', 'should', 'have', 'got', 'more', 'recognition', 'did']",Everyone's Hero

1047885,A3DD70OOO17HHZ,B000MNOX9E,"Declan Gallagher ""D""","[4, 21]","You know you've made a bad kid movie when the kids in the theater don't laugh. Especially when there are about a hundred snot jokes. 'Everyone's Hero' is a terrible kids film. It's not worse than 'Barnyard', and I won't even compare it to 'Cars', because nothing could beat that movie. Let's just say that this is worse than 'RV'. Maybe it's because I only see a handful of kids movies a year that I didn't enjoy this one. Maybe it's because the false messages that kids movies peddle make me angry. I don't have a good reason why they do, but they do. I think it's because the whole idea that movies for kids can't just be for entertainment. They have to have a message.Adult movies don't have messages, and if they do they are subtle, and usually only in Oscar nominated movies. For example: 'Crash': ""Don't let your prejudices get the best of you."" 'Munich': ""Violence begets violence."" So on and so forth. But, you didn't see a message in 'Miami Vice', or 'Crank', or 'The Devil Wears Prada'. 'Cars' had a subtle message. 'Over The Hedge' did as well, and the only things that made that a kids movie was the animation and the PG rating. However, lots of kids didn't understand that movie, because it was largely satirical, poking fun at our reliance on junk food and shiny TV's. This movie pokes fun at...Eleanor Rosevelt. That's not an easy target at all.The message in 'Everyone's Hero' is pervasive throughout the movie, but it's understated for most of the time. But, the last line in the movie pounds the message of the movie so hard into your head that you reject it. It doesn't imply the message, like most kids movies (as if that's not bad enough), but it out-rightly says it. This is how the line of dialogue goes: ""Even if you're not good at something, never give up. Keep trying, and you're sure to succeed."" The movie is about a young boy, Yankee Irving, who lives in Depression-era New York. His father works at Yankee Stadium as a janitor, playing to the kids movie cliche that the impoverished kid rises to the top. It would be nice to see a rich kid rise off his lazy butt and succeed at something. Anyway, Babe Ruth's bat gets stolen, and Yankee has to go off to look for it.The only reason the movie gets two stars as opposed to one is because Yankee's talking baseball (voiced by Rob Reiner) provides a few mild chuckles, and the mere fact that Babe Ruth's bat is a sassy black woman is so ridiculous that it's a little funny. Other than that, parents will find that the movie is a nice nap, and kids may enjoy it. In my screening, there were three groups of parents and kids, and only one group (a mother and her two small children) were laughing, and not that hard or often. This is one of the may movies that will dissapoint at the box office, but will make a killing on DVD when parents buy it for their kids to watch while they enjoy a bath.There is a scene in the movie 'The Ring' that I am reminded of every time I see a bad kids movie. The mother character rents Pokemon videos for her son, and as he sits in front of the TV, transfixed by flashing colors and incoherent dialogue, she sits in the bathtub reading a magazine. That is probably the only way this movie will make money, sadly: a woman in a tub.",2,Nothing More But A Poorly Conceived Kids Film,1158451200,"09 17, 2006",2006,3238,"['know', ""'ve"", 'made', 'bad', 'kid', 'movie', 'when', 'kids', 'theater', 'do', ""n't"", 'laugh', 'Especially', 'when', 'are', 'hundred', 'snot', 'jokes', ""'Everyone"", 'Hero', 'terrible', 'kids', 'film', 'not', 'worse', ""'Barnyard"", 'wo', ""n't"", 'even', 'compare', ""'Cars"", 'nothing', 'could', 'beat', 'movie', 'Let', 'just', 'say', 'worse', ""'RV"", 'Maybe', 'only', 'see', 'handful', 'kids', 'movies', 'year', 'did', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'one', 'Maybe', 'false', 'messages', 'kids', 'movies', 'peddle', 'make', 'angry', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'good', 'reason', 'why', 'do', 'do', 'think', 'whole', 'idea', 'movies', 'kids', 'ca', ""n't"", 'just', 'be', 'entertainment', 'have', 'have', 'message.Adult', 'movies', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'messages', 'do', 'are', 'subtle', 'usually', 'only', 'Oscar', 'nominated', 'movies', 'example', ""'Crash"", 'Do', ""n't"", 'let', 'prejudices', 'get', 'best', 'Violence', 'begets', 'violence', 'So', 'so', 'forth', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'message', ""'Miami"", 'Vice', 'Devil', 'Wears', 'Prada', ""'Cars"", 'had', 'subtle', 'message', 'Hedge', 'did', 'as', 'well', 'only', 'things', 'made', 'kids', 'movie', 'was', 'animation', 'PG', 'rating', 'However', 'lots', 'kids', 'did', ""n't"", 'understand', 'movie', 'was', 'largely', 'satirical', 'poking', 'fun', 'reliance', 'junk', 'food', 'shiny', 'TV', 'movie', 'fun', 'Eleanor', 'Rosevelt', 'not', 'easy', 'target', 'all.The', 'message', ""'Everyone"", 'Hero', 'pervasive', 'movie', 'understated', 'most', 'time', 'last', 'line', 'movie', 'message', 'movie', 'so', 'hard', 'head', 'reject', ""n't"", 'imply', 'message', 'most', 'kids', 'movies', 'not', 'bad', 'enough', 'out-rightly', 'how', 'line', 'dialogue', 'Even', ""'re"", 'not', 'good', 'something', 'never', 'give', 'up', 'Keep', 'trying', ""'re"", 'sure', 'succeed', 'movie', 'young', 'boy', 'Yankee', 'Irving', 'who', 'Depression-era', 'New', 'York', 'father', 'Yankee', 'Stadium', 'janitor', 'playing', 'kids', 'movie', 'cliche', 'impoverished', 'kid', 'top', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'see', 'rich', 'kid', 'rise', 'lazy', 'butt', 'succeed', 'something', 'Anyway', 'Babe', 'Ruth', 'bat', 'stolen', 'Yankee', 'go', 'off', 'look', 'it.The', 'only', 'reason', 'movie', 'two', 'stars', 'opposed', 'one', 'Yankee', 'talking', 'baseball', 'voiced', 'Rob', 'Reiner', 'few', 'mild', 'chuckles', 'mere', 'fact', 'Babe', 'Ruth', 'bat', 'sassy', 'black', 'woman', 'so', 'ridiculous', 'little', 'funny', 'Other', 'parents', 'will', 'find', 'movie', 'nice', 'nap', 'kids', 'may', 'enjoy', 'screening', 'were', 'three', 'groups', 'parents', 'kids', 'only', 'one', 'group', 'mother', 'two', 'small', 'children', 'were', 'laughing', 'not', 'hard', 'often', 'one', 'may', 'movies', 'will', 'dissapoint', 'box', 'office', 'will', 'make', 'killing', 'DVD', 'when', 'parents', 'buy', 'kids', 'watch', 'enjoy', 'bath.There', 'scene', 'movie', 'Ring', 'am', 'reminded', 'time', 'see', 'bad', 'kids', 'movie', 'mother', 'character', 'rents', 'Pokemon', 'videos', 'son', 'front', 'TV', 'transfixed', 'flashing', 'colors', 'incoherent', 'dialogue', 'bathtub', 'reading', 'magazine', 'probably', 'only', 'way', 'movie', 'will', 'make', 'money', 'sadly', 'woman', 'tub']",Everyone's Hero

1047902,A2RKI7RPP5CJMG,B000MNOX9E,"K. Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!""","[27, 27]","""Everyone's Hero"" is a wonderful tale about a young boy whose father is fired from his job at Yankee Stadium when Babe Ruth's bat is stolen on his watch.  The boy knows who stole the bat and sets out to reclaim it for the Babe and to save his father's much needed job.  The young boy, Yankee Irving, is a huge dreamer, who hopes to one day play for the Yankees.  He picks up quite a friend in Screwie (Rob Reiner), a Major League foul ball who hesitantly agrees to help Yankee recover the bat as long as the boy promises to leave him to rot in the sandlot where Yankee found him.Yankee meets quite a motley crew on his travels from New York to Chicago.  He runs into some kind-hearted hobos, a young girl named Marti (Raven), who gets him in touch with her father, Rooster Brewster of the Negro League, who's team just happens to be headed to Chicago.  He also runs into the villainous Lefty Maginnis (William H. Macy), a washed out pitcher who thinks that by stealing Babe's bat, Darlin', he can save his job with the Chicago Cubs and win the World Series.The story moves at a wonderful pace and holds the attention of both children and adults.  My daughter went crazy when Screwie and Darlin' went at each other, and the antics of Lefty had everyone laughing.  It features an all-star cast including those aforementioned and Robert Wagner, Whoopi Goldberg, Mandy Patinkin, and Brian Dennehy as Babe Ruth.  Joe Torre plays the manager of the Yanks and Dana Reeve plays Yankee's mom.  Of course, Reeve and her husband, Christopher Reeve (who initially directed this film), both passed away before seeing this film come to life on the screen.  They should both be proud of their work done on this film.If you love baseball, strong family bonds, slapstick comedy, or nostalgia, I highly recommend you see this film.  Rest assured that you don't have to be a sports fan to enjoy this film, but for those of us who do, it's nice to see not only the Babe get some screen time, but Lou Gehrig as well.A highly recommend, future classic, family film.",5,Great Family Film With Classic Potential,1158451200,"09 17, 2006",2006,2043,"['Everyone', 'Hero', 'wonderful', 'tale', 'young', 'boy', 'father', 'fired', 'job', 'Yankee', 'Stadium', 'when', 'Babe', 'Ruth', 'bat', 'stolen', 'watch', 'boy', 'who', 'stole', 'bat', 'out', 'reclaim', 'Babe', 'save', 'father', 'much', 'needed', 'job', 'young', 'boy', 'Yankee', 'Irving', 'huge', 'dreamer', 'who', 'one', 'day', 'play', 'Yankees', 'up', 'quite', 'friend', 'Screwie', 'Rob', 'Reiner', 'Major', 'League', 'foul', 'ball', 'who', 'hesitantly', 'help', 'Yankee', 'recover', 'bat', 'as', 'long', 'boy', 'leave', 'rot', 'sandlot', 'where', 'Yankee', 'found', 'him.Yankee', 'meets', 'quite', 'motley', 'crew', 'travels', 'New', 'York', 'Chicago', 'kind-hearted', 'hobos', 'young', 'girl', 'named', 'Marti', 'Raven', 'who', 'touch', 'father', 'Rooster', 'Brewster', 'Negro', 'League', 'who', 'team', 'just', 'be', 'headed', 'Chicago', 'also', 'villainous', 'Lefty', 'Maginnis', 'William', 'H.', 'Macy', 'washed', 'out', 'pitcher', 'who', 'stealing', 'Babe', 'bat', 'Darlin', 'can', 'save', 'job', 'Chicago', 'Cubs', 'win', 'World', 'Series.The', 'story', 'moves', 'wonderful', 'pace', 'attention', 'children', 'adults', 'daughter', 'went', 'crazy', 'when', 'Screwie', 'Darlin', 'went', 'other', 'antics', 'Lefty', 'had', 'everyone', 'laughing', 'all-star', 'cast', 'including', 'aforementioned', 'Robert', 'Wagner', 'Whoopi', 'Goldberg', 'Mandy', 'Patinkin', 'Brian', 'Dennehy', 'Babe', 'Ruth', 'Joe', 'Torre', 'manager', 'Yanks', 'Dana', 'Reeve', 'Yankee', 'mom', 'course', 'Reeve', 'husband', 'Christopher', 'Reeve', 'who', 'initially', 'directed', 'film', 'passed', 'away', 'seeing', 'film', 'come', 'life', 'screen', 'should', 'be', 'proud', 'work', 'done', 'film.If', 'love', 'baseball', 'strong', 'family', 'bonds', 'slapstick', 'comedy', 'nostalgia', 'highly', 'recommend', 'see', 'film', 'Rest', 'assured', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'sports', 'fan', 'enjoy', 'film', 'who', 'do', 'nice', 'see', 'not', 'only', 'Babe', 'get', 'screen', 'time', 'Lou', 'Gehrig', 'well.A', 'highly', 'recommend', 'future', 'classic', 'family', 'film']",Everyone's Hero

1047906,AHF97M45JFCB,B000MNOX9E,ONENEO,"[0, 0]","Everyone&#8217;s Hero is one of those rare animated features that boasted a pretty hardy theatrical run but slipped onto the DVD scene fairly quietly and slipped into relative obscurity since.  It&#8217;s kind of a shame really, because the piece has a lot of heart and it&#8217;s delivered in such a manner that children and adults alike can find something to take away from the experience.  This isn&#8217;t to say that the film is without flaw of course but before we get into the ups and downs of Everyone&#8217;s Hero, let&#8217;s take a moment to review the facts.Released on the big screen back in 2006, Everyone&#8217;s Hero is the 88-minute romp of a blend of historical and fictional characters based on a semi-true story that just so happens to be 20th Century Fox&#8217;s first theatrical release to wear the G-rating since 97&#8217;s Anastasia.Set in 1932, back when the concept of CG held absolutely no meaning and the Great Depression was just getting underway, we follow the exploits of young baseball fan Yankee Irving (Jake T. Austin), whose father Stanley (Mandy Patinkin) happens to work as a janitor for New York City's Yankee Stadium.  Like most Playstation-less kids of the era, Yankee has dreams of playing for the Yankees despite lacking the skills to play sandlot baseball with the meanies on his block.One day during one such bullying, he finds a talking baseball on the sandlot he names Screwie (Rob Reiner).  Sure this could have been enough material to base the entire film upon (after all, how many of us discover a talking baseball only to store it in our underwear drawer) but alas, this proves only the beginning of the adventures for dear Yankee.While father and son are in the stadium, a thief steals Babe Ruth's famous bat Darlin' (which can also talk like Screwie and is voiced by Whoopi Goldberg).  While the reason certain sporting goods can talk is never revealed, the heist results in Yankee's father being blamed and fired.  The real hijinks concern Yankee reuniting talking bat with talking ball, reuniting lucky bat with proper owner and, as a bonus, perhaps clearing his father&#8217;s good name in the process.On the surface there&#8217;s a lot of potential for a good feeling classic and the cast of voice talent and even direction is top notch.  Kids will likely enjoy the tale and forgive its shortcomings though adults will likely find it a bit tedious by the midway point.  It has moments of believability but by the end talking bats and balls are the least of the farfetchedness.  Prepare for a near constant succession of coincidences and happenstances that result in a lot of clich&eacute; situations that all culminate in a very unlikely finale.  Of course some degree of suspension of disbelief is required on account of the fact that the tale intertwines its prose with actual historical dates/ events, going in expecting an entirely fictional affair is perhaps the best bet for the skeptical adult viewer.Pacing and production values are solid; in fact keep in mind that in 2006 even industry leader Pixar shied away from the practice of animating humans due to the difficulty of keeping things proportional yet the folks behind Everyone&#8217;s Hero showed no fears in doing so and the end result still holds up today.In conclusion this one&#8217;s absolutely chalk full of good intentions and hints of greatness but the end result is fairly mediocre.  A little more grounding in reality coupled to greater effort to avoid the far-reaching, forcefully feel-good moments could have made Everyone's Hero fun and inspirational for, well, everyone, not just for the little ones.",3,Heartfelt Message Delivered in a Kid-Oriented Package,1388793600,"01 4, 2014",2014,3634,"['Everyone', '8217', 'Hero', 'one', 'rare', 'animated', 'features', 'boasted', 'pretty', 'hardy', 'theatrical', 'run', 'slipped', 'DVD', 'scene', 'fairly', 'quietly', 'slipped', 'relative', 'obscurity', '8217', 'kind', 'shame', 'really', 'piece', 'lot', 'heart', '8217', 's', 'delivered', 'such', 'manner', 'children', 'adults', 'alike', 'can', 'find', 'something', 'take', 'away', 'experience', 'isn', '8217', 't', 'say', 'film', 'flaw', 'course', 'get', 'ups', 'downs', 'Everyone', '8217', 'Hero', 'let', '8217', 's', 'take', 'moment', 'review', 'facts.Released', 'big', 'screen', 'back', '2006', 'Everyone', '8217', 'Hero', '88-minute', 'romp', 'blend', 'historical', 'fictional', 'characters', 'based', 'semi-true', 'story', 'just', 'so', 'be', '20th', 'Century', 'Fox', '8217', 'first', 'theatrical', 'release', 'wear', 'G-rating', '97', '8217', 's', 'Anastasia.Set', '1932', 'back', 'when', 'concept', 'CG', 'held', 'absolutely', 'meaning', 'Great', 'Depression', 'was', 'just', 'getting', 'underway', 'follow', 'exploits', 'young', 'baseball', 'fan', 'Yankee', 'Irving', 'Jake', 'T.', 'Austin', 'father', 'Stanley', 'Mandy', 'Patinkin', 'work', 'janitor', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'Yankee', 'Stadium', 'most', 'Playstation-less', 'kids', 'era', 'Yankee', 'dreams', 'playing', 'Yankees', 'lacking', 'skills', 'play', 'sandlot', 'baseball', 'meanies', 'block.One', 'day', 'one', 'such', 'bullying', 'talking', 'baseball', 'sandlot', 'Screwie', 'Rob', 'Reiner', 'Sure', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'enough', 'material', 'base', 'entire', 'film', 'upon', 'how', 'many', 'discover', 'talking', 'baseball', 'only', 'store', 'underwear', 'drawer', 'alas', 'only', 'beginning', 'adventures', 'dear', 'Yankee.While', 'father', 'son', 'are', 'stadium', 'thief', 'steals', 'Babe', 'Ruth', 'famous', 'bat', 'Darlin', 'can', 'also', 'talk', 'Screwie', 'voiced', 'Whoopi', 'Goldberg', 'reason', 'certain', 'sporting', 'goods', 'can', 'talk', 'never', 'revealed', 'heist', 'results', 'Yankee', 'father', 'being', 'blamed', 'fired', 'real', 'hijinks', 'concern', 'Yankee', 'reuniting', 'talking', 'bat', 'talking', 'ball', 'reuniting', 'lucky', 'bat', 'proper', 'owner', 'bonus', 'perhaps', 'clearing', 'father', '8217', 'good', 'name', 'process.On', 'surface', 'there', '8217', 's', 'lot', 'potential', 'good', 'feeling', 'classic', 'cast', 'voice', 'talent', 'even', 'direction', 'top', 'notch', 'Kids', 'will', 'likely', 'enjoy', 'tale', 'forgive', 'shortcomings', 'adults', 'will', 'likely', 'find', 'bit', 'tedious', 'midway', 'point', 'moments', 'believability', 'end', 'talking', 'bats', 'balls', 'are', 'least', 'farfetchedness', 'Prepare', 'near', 'constant', 'succession', 'coincidences', 'happenstances', 'result', 'lot', 'clich', 'eacute', 'situations', 'culminate', 'very', 'unlikely', 'finale', 'course', 'degree', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'required', 'account', 'fact', 'tale', 'intertwines', 'prose', 'actual', 'historical', 'dates/', 'events', 'going', 'expecting', 'entirely', 'fictional', 'affair', 'perhaps', 'best', 'bet', 'skeptical', 'adult', 'viewer.Pacing', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'solid', 'fact', 'keep', 'mind', '2006', 'even', 'industry', 'leader', 'Pixar', 'shied', 'away', 'practice', 'animating', 'humans', 'due', 'difficulty', 'keeping', 'things', 'proportional', 'yet', 'folks', 'Everyone', '8217', 'Hero', 'showed', 'fears', 'doing', 'so', 'end', 'result', 'still', 'up', 'today.In', 'conclusion', 'one', '8217', 'absolutely', 'chalk', 'full', 'good', 'intentions', 'hints', 'greatness', 'end', 'result', 'fairly', 'mediocre', 'little', 'more', 'grounding', 'reality', 'coupled', 'greater', 'effort', 'avoid', 'far-reaching', 'forcefully', 'feel-good', 'moments', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'Everyone', 'Hero', 'fun', 'inspirational', 'well', 'everyone', 'not', 'just', 'little', 'ones']",Everyone's Hero

Macy, Richard Kind, Mandy Patinkin, Rob Reiner, Raven-Symone, Robert Wagner, and even Joe Torre as the Yankee's Manager.The year is 1932. ""Yankee"" Irving (Jake Austin) is a ten-year-old boy who lives in New York and loves baseball, but no matter how hard he tries he always ends up striking out and falling down. Yankee becomes frustrated and almost gives up until he finds a talking baseball (Rob Reiner). He names the ball Screwie and Screwie becomes Yankee's companion and, on a different level, a part of his conscious. Yankee's dad works at Yankee Stadium. The Yankee's are beating the Chicago Cubs in the World Series and the Cubs' owner (Robert Wagner) hatches a plan to have his dirtiest player, Lefty Maginnis (William H. Macy), steal Babe Ruth's bat, Darlin' (Whoopi Goldberg). Lefty runs into Yankee before he steals Darlin'. When Yankee's father is fired because of the missing bat, Yankee realizes what has happened and sets out to get Darlin' back and return her to the Babe. The journey takes Yankee from NewYork to Chicago. Along the way he meets some friendly hobos (actually most hobos in that period were friendly) and has an encounter with some baseball players in the Negro Leagues.The movie vividly recreates the images of the early 1930s and the colorful palette is quite pleasing. At the film's heart is a message of determination and perseverance, even when the odds are stacked against a person. Tied to that message is an affection and love for baseball as well as a nod to the injustice of poverty and racism.There are some inaccuracies with the historical basis of the film. For instance, the Yankees did play the Cubs in the 1932 World Series, but the series only lasted four games, not seven. Yet, where the film veers from history for dramatic effect, it makes up for it in other areas, such as the details in the uniforms of the Cincinnati Tigers' Negro League team. Some might be confused by the lack of specific style in EVERYONE'S HERO: at times the film looks like a sophisticated piece of animation that is almost Pixar-worthy, while there are other times the film veers into antics similar to the hijinxes of the Road Runner, Wylie Coyote, Bugs Bunny, and other Warner Brother characters. Personally, I enjoyed this uneven-style because it grounded the film in reality, while reminding viewers it's just a cartoon.I thoroughly enjoyed EVERYONE'S HERO. It's a great animated baseball picture with important and strong messages about determination and the importance of family. The film brings recognition to forgotten elements of American history, e.g. the Negro Leagues and hobos. It's a film full of promise and hope. It is also the last project Christopher Reeve worked on before his death and for film buffs the movie is worth watching for that fact alone. But like many of the films Reeve made, EVERYONE'S HERO appeals to a much broader audience, not just children and baseball fans. It's a movie that calls out to the hero in everyone.",4,Baseball and Family,1338768000,"06 4, 2012",2012,3278,"['EVERYONE', 'HERO', 'charming', 'heartwarming', 'delightful', 'animated', 'film', 'young', 'boy', 'who', 'baseball', 'home', 'help', 'hero', 'Babe', 'Ruth', 'save', 'dad', 'job', 'film', 'impressive', 'cast', 'talented', 'voice', 'actors', 'Brian', 'Dennehy', 'Whoopi', 'Goldberg', 'Jake', 'Austin', 'William', 'H.', 'Macy', 'Richard', 'Kind', 'Mandy', 'Patinkin', 'Rob', 'Reiner', 'Raven-Symone', 'Robert', 'Wagner', 'even', 'Joe', 'Torre', 'Yankee', 'Manager.The', 'year', '1932', 'Yankee', 'Irving', 'Jake', 'Austin', 'ten-year-old', 'boy', 'who', 'New', 'York', 'baseball', 'matter', 'how', 'hard', 'always', 'up', 'striking', 'falling', 'down', 'Yankee', 'frustrated', 'almost', 'up', 'talking', 'baseball', 'Rob', 'Reiner', 'ball', 'Screwie', 'Screwie', 'Yankee', 'companion', 'different', 'level', 'part', 'conscious', 'Yankee', 'dad', 'Yankee', 'Stadium', 'Yankee', 'are', 'beating', 'Chicago', 'Cubs', 'World', 'Series', 'Cubs', 'owner', 'Robert', 'Wagner', 'plan', 'have', 'dirtiest', 'player', 'Lefty', 'Maginnis', 'William', 'H.', 'Macy', 'steal', 'Babe', 'Ruth', 'bat', 'Darlin', 'Whoopi', 'Goldberg', 'Lefty', 'Yankee', 'Darlin', 'When', 'Yankee', 'father', 'fired', 'missing', 'bat', 'Yankee', 'what', 'happened', 'out', 'get', 'Darlin', 'back', 'return', 'Babe', 'journey', 'Yankee', 'NewYork', 'Chicago', 'way', 'friendly', 'hobos', 'actually', 'most', 'hobos', 'period', 'were', 'friendly', 'encounter', 'baseball', 'players', 'Negro', 'Leagues.The', 'movie', 'vividly', 'images', 'early', '1930s', 'colorful', 'palette', 'quite', 'pleasing', 'film', 'heart', 'message', 'determination', 'perseverance', 'even', 'when', 'odds', 'are', 'stacked', 'person', 'Tied', 'message', 'affection', 'love', 'baseball', 'as', 'well', 'nod', 'injustice', 'poverty', 'racism.There', 'are', 'inaccuracies', 'historical', 'basis', 'film', 'instance', 'Yankees', 'did', 'play', 'Cubs', '1932', 'World', 'Series', 'series', 'only', 'lasted', 'four', 'games', 'not', 'seven', 'where', 'film', 'veers', 'history', 'dramatic', 'effect', 'up', 'other', 'areas', 'such', 'details', 'uniforms', 'Cincinnati', 'Tigers', 'Negro', 'League', 'team', 'might', 'be', 'confused', 'lack', 'specific', 'style', 'EVERYONE', 'HERO', 'times', 'film', 'sophisticated', 'piece', 'animation', 'almost', 'Pixar-worthy', 'are', 'other', 'times', 'film', 'veers', 'antics', 'similar', 'hijinxes', 'Road', 'Runner', 'Wylie', 'Coyote', 'Bugs', 'Bunny', 'other', 'Warner', 'Brother', 'characters', 'Personally', 'enjoyed', 'uneven-style', 'grounded', 'film', 'reality', 'reminding', 'viewers', 'just', 'cartoon.I', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'EVERYONE', 'HERO', 'great', 'animated', 'baseball', 'picture', 'important', 'strong', 'messages', 'determination', 'importance', 'family', 'film', 'recognition', 'forgotten', 'elements', 'American', 'history', 'e.g', 'Negro', 'Leagues', 'hobos', 'film', 'full', 'promise', 'hope', 'also', 'last', 'project', 'Christopher', 'Reeve', 'worked', 'death', 'film', 'buffs', 'movie', 'worth', 'watching', 'fact', 'alone', 'many', 'films', 'Reeve', 'made', 'EVERYONE', 'HERO', 'appeals', 'much', 'broader', 'audience', 'not', 'just', 'children', 'baseball', 'fans', 'movie', 'out', 'hero', 'everyone']",Everyone's Hero

However, it surpasses the realism of many of the others with a powerful message of perservance and making your dreams happen. This movie made me laugh, then I cried; then I laughed again just to cry even more later. It's produced and directed by a man who valued himself the meaning of trying and trying again. In a collaboration with his wife Dana and other respected innovators, this was the last movie Christopher Reeve worked on before his death. There is a tribute to him as a bonus feature on this disc.Like the ever popular first Ice Age movies and both Garfield films, the movie buyer has the option to both full and widescreen modes. However, I'm not happy with the double-sided release the studio decided to do. It's quiet annoying and even anxiety-ridden as you try extra hard when flipping the disc not to drop or scratch it. One side's bad enough, but double-sided is just not pleasing.",4,Good Clean fun of an Adventure,1174780800,"03 25, 2007",2007,971,"['animated', 'feature', 'far', 'different', 'ones', ""'m"", 'use', 'seeing', 'However', 'realism', 'many', 'others', 'powerful', 'message', 'perservance', 'making', 'dreams', 'happen', 'movie', 'made', 'then', 'cried', 'then', 'laughed', 'again', 'just', 'cry', 'even', 'more', 'later', 'produced', 'directed', 'man', 'who', 'valued', 'meaning', 'trying', 'trying', 'again', 'collaboration', 'wife', 'Dana', 'other', 'respected', 'innovators', 'was', 'last', 'movie', 'Christopher', 'Reeve', 'worked', 'death', 'tribute', 'bonus', 'feature', 'disc.Like', 'ever', 'popular', 'first', 'Ice', 'Age', 'movies', 'Garfield', 'films', 'movie', 'buyer', 'option', 'full', 'widescreen', 'modes', 'However', ""'m"", 'not', 'happy', 'double-sided', 'release', 'studio', 'decided', 'do', 'quiet', 'annoying', 'even', 'anxiety-ridden', 'try', 'extra', 'hard', 'when', 'flipping', 'disc', 'not', 'drop', 'scratch', 'One', 'side', 'bad', 'enough', 'double-sided', 'just', 'not', 'pleasing']",Everyone's Hero
