Brought smiles and tears of joy to a lot of people. Had a poor copy on vhs tape that i played from time to time & thouroghly enjoyed. When I saw it on dvd i bought 5 copies for friends & family. somewhat removed from my mexican heritage, i found this to be a great comfort. Purists may feel that mexican artists might have done as good, or better, can't deny Linda did an outstanding job. Highly recommended. My complements to the seller. Viva Mexico!

Linda's great voice comes through with real feeling and happiness. She obviously has a lot of pride in her Mexican roots. The show has a nice mixture of mariachi songs and old huapangos. When she sings huapangos, her full range comes through. My son(who is 19 and plays guitar and piano) was extremely impressed with her vocal range and her ability to hold notes. It's a great DVD.

I too found myself loving these songs as well as the concert which is highly enjoyable with anecdotes from Ms. Ronstadt's childhood, not to mention the Mariachi Vargas de Tecalitlan with their contagious and vibrant energy as well as the incredible dancers from Ballet Folklorico de la Fonda which made even my toddler nephew who happened to be visiting get up and dance to rhythm of the music.
