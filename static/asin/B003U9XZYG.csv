1363283,A32T2H8150OJLU,B003U9XZYG,ARH,"[8, 9]","I'm not usually one to go out of my way to watch a western, but this one looked just quirky enough to maybe be worth a look.In this show a notorious gunfighter, ""The Montana Kid"", flees north to escape a team of bounty hunters.  He rides into a small western town and promptly keels over.  He has been shot in an unfortunate spot -- you'll have to watch to find out where.  Anyway, shortly after coming to and wandering around the town, crossing paths with nearly everyone in short order he ""has words"" with the local blacksmith, and ""The Kid"" demands satisfaction.  He ""calls him out"", after the code of the old west.  Well, there's one big problem...the smith doesn't own a handgun.  The Kid can't believe it.  In his book you can't be a man unless you carry a gun and know how to use it.  What he didn't realize is that when he rode north he entered Canada, and happened into a small town of about 17 people...none of whom wears a gun.  He can't believe it!  And he then finds himself stranded in town until he can heal well enough to move on, that is, after he has a gunfight with the smith.I found this entire scenario to be hilarious!  I watched it all the way through, wondering what mishap could happen next.If you like shows like ""Rustler's Rhapsody"" or even ""Quigley Down Under"" then you will like this one.  It's more comedy and romantic comedy than it is western.

1363286,AB34G6VKP28L,B003U9XZYG,"Charity Bishop ""Film Fanatic""","[5, 6]","Westerns are not usually my thing, but I'm happy I came across this film. It is not big budget or in any way impressive, but it is a lot of fun.The Montana Kid (Paul Gross) has a bit of a problem: he smells like a pigsty, he has a bullet in his backside, and he's narrowly escaped a hanging... and is dragging the tree branch behind him. While he is unconscious, his horse wanders across the Canadian border and winds up in a small town where no one seems to be armed. What he wants most is to get out of there, but he can't... because the local blacksmith has insulted him by calling him ""common."" The Montana Kid just can't stand for that kind of an insult, so he challenges the man to a gunfight. Problem is, no one has a revolver... except for Jane Taylor (Sienna Guillory), and she will only give him the rusted piece of metal if he helps her get her windmill up and working.Her revolver has seen better days. In fact, when he picks it up, the handle falls off. But you cannot just ride out of town when you have challenged someone to a duel, so he sets about fixing it and waiting for parts. Never mind there is a posse on his tail. Never mind that the townspeople are all very curious about him. Never mind that he is running up a tab at the local store/tea house. A man's gotta do what a man's gotta do, even if it means being himself instead of the Montana Kid.I'll put it right out there: at times, this movie is stupid, but since it is not trying to be anything but stupid, it works. It is a fun-loving western that does not take its characters, setting, or dialogue too seriously. Instead, it offers us humorous clich&eacute;s and tongue in cheek characterization: the trigger-happy gunslinger, the local man obsessed with a stump he can't pull out, the bickering store owners, the Chinese family that can't speak a word of English, and the Canadian Mounted Officer who can't quote the rules just right. It isn't hilarious, but it is amusing and the cast is not half bad. There are moments the dialogue sticks but for the most part, I was having too much fun to care. It is mostly contained in a western town, but there is an impressive gunfight (that starts by accident) and some beautiful costumes going for it. The score is also cheeky in all the right ways.Westerns (or indeed, any kind of film) that are appropriate for younger audiences are hard to find, but this is one of them. It is not perfect, but it is also not a kid's movie. It never feels childish or convoluted, and there are some meaningful scenes in it, as the Kid comes to realize that he doesn't have to fight. He can walk away if he wants to, even if it means dealing with the remorse of his past actions. It is not an award-winning production, but it does what it sets out to do: entertain.",5,Surprisingly Delightful,1332892800,"03 28, 2012",2012,2774,"['Westerns', 'are', 'not', 'usually', 'thing', ""'m"", 'happy', 'came', 'film', 'not', 'big', 'budget', 'way', 'impressive', 'lot', 'fun.The', 'Montana', 'Kid', 'Paul', 'Gross', 'bit', 'problem', 'pigsty', 'bullet', 'backside', 'narrowly', 'escaped', 'hanging', 'dragging', 'tree', 'branch', 'unconscious', 'horse', 'wanders', 'Canadian', 'border', 'up', 'small', 'town', 'where', 'one', 'be', 'armed', 'What', 'most', 'get', 'ca', ""n't"", 'local', 'blacksmith', 'insulted', 'calling', 'common', 'Montana', 'Kid', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'kind', 'insult', 'man', 'gunfight', 'Problem', 'one', 'revolver', 'Jane', 'Taylor', 'Sienna', 'Guillory', 'will', 'only', 'give', 'rusted', 'piece', 'metal', 'get', 'windmill', 'up', 'working.Her', 'revolver', 'seen', 'better', 'days', 'fact', 'when', 'up', 'handle', 'off', 'can', 'not', 'just', 'ride', 'town', 'when', 'have', 'challenged', 'someone', 'duel', 'fixing', 'waiting', 'parts', 'Never', 'mind', 'posse', 'tail', 'mind', 'townspeople', 'are', 'very', 'curious', 'mind', 'running', 'up', 'tab', 'local', 'store/tea', 'house', 'man', 'got', 'ta', 'do', 'what', 'man', 'got', 'ta', 'do', 'even', 'being', 'instead', 'Montana', 'Kid.I', ""'ll"", 'put', 'right', 'there', 'times', 'movie', 'stupid', 'not', 'trying', 'be', 'anything', 'stupid', 'fun-loving', 'western', 'not', 'take', 'characters', 'setting', 'dialogue', 'too', 'seriously', 'Instead', 'humorous', 'clich', 'eacute', 'tongue', 'cheek', 'characterization', 'trigger-happy', 'gunslinger', 'local', 'man', 'obsessed', 'stump', 'ca', ""n't"", 'pull', 'out', 'bickering', 'store', 'owners', 'Chinese', 'family', 'ca', ""n't"", 'speak', 'word', 'English', 'Canadian', 'Mounted', 'Officer', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'quote', 'rules', 'just', 'right', ""n't"", 'hilarious', 'amusing', 'cast', 'not', 'half', 'bad', 'are', 'moments', 'dialogue', 'sticks', 'most', 'part', 'was', 'having', 'too', 'much', 'fun', 'care', 'mostly', 'contained', 'western', 'town', 'impressive', 'gunfight', 'accident', 'beautiful', 'costumes', 'going', 'score', 'also', 'cheeky', 'right', 'ways.Westerns', 'indeed', 'kind', 'film', 'are', 'appropriate', 'younger', 'audiences', 'are', 'hard', 'find', 'one', 'not', 'perfect', 'also', 'not', 'kid', 'movie', 'never', 'childish', 'convoluted', 'are', 'meaningful', 'scenes', 'Kid', 'realize', ""n't"", 'have', 'fight', 'can', 'walk', 'away', 'even', 'dealing', 'remorse', 'past', 'actions', 'not', 'award-winning', 'production', 'what', 'out', 'do', 'entertain']",N/A
1363287,A2N932LHI27WTC,B003U9XZYG,Chem,"[3, 3]","I liked this movie.I had no idea what to expect, but the movie came off for me after I decided to just let it flow.It isn't serious, but it isn't slapstick either. It's subtle humor bordered on not-quite-serious situations, and the viewer somewhat gradually realizes it all...like I said, just let it flow.I won't go into the plot much, but I will ask: Remember the old american TV show Green Acres? Actor Eddie Albert plays attorney-turned-farmer Oliver Wendell Douglas, who moves to a town where he is the only sane man in a community of quirky characters. They, including Oliver's wife, somehow all understand each other despite their quirks and the surreal situations... That is what struck me about the Montana Kid's (Paul Gross) experience in the frontier Canadian town. He comes in, wounded and on the run. And with his ""Code of the West"" mentality from the wild-west USA, he is quickly determined to shoot it out w/ the local blacksmith who 'insulted' him. Problem is, nobody in town has a working pistol. What to do ?!?The Code forbids the Kid to shoot an unarmed man outright, and you don't ""quick-draw at high noon"" with a shotgun or a rifle...But I called a showdown, dammit! A matter of honor - I can't call it off!The townspeople don't understand, or perhaps more accurately, don't care about the conventions of his ""code"". What happens? The Kid ends up like a youngster at a family get-together. Ever go to one, where an older kid chases the younger ones? ""Arggggh!!"" he goes, being the mock-monster. ""Yahhgggg!!!"" the smaller kids scream, running away in semi-mock fright. Eventually they run to a parent or adult: ""So-and-so is CHASING me!!!"" The adult's calm reply: ""Well, just don't run and he CAN'T chase you"".That's the Kid's humorous dilemma. He wants to 'chase', like the bigger kid at the family gathering, but this obscure little town just won't 'run' like he's used to! And the quirky characters, with their almost-Green Acres-like understandings of each other, largely dismiss him as a danger. Thus the rug is pulled out from underneath the Kid.My favorite points: I got a kick out of the Kid periodically saying ""What is WRONG with these people??"" in that exasperated gravely/growly voice. Also the scene where he asks someone ""Is the whole country insane, or is it just this town??"". I also liked it when they discovered his real name (Sean? or some such) and started calling him that...Paul Gross was GREAT.Least favorite parts:  The part where he's encircled by Mounties that beat him at the dance. This stepped a bit out of the realm of the comedic 'box' the film had developed up to that point IMHO.  (Admittedly, I may have missed something there, but regardless, it was quickly resolved by the later scenes)... I also didn't feel the dog being killed by the bounty hunters quite fit in.Don't misunderstand - this movie is not on the highly surreal level of Green Acres; but it still requires that ""suspension of disbelief"" to enjoy it. Its not hard though - just let it flow...I liked it, and look forward to getting the DVD.--Chem.(PS - you don't like this type of humor?

Gunless has a very funny premise: Injured American gunfighter on the run arrives in a Canadian border town, challenges the blacksmith to a gun duel, discovers that there are no working pistols in the town, and has to wait around for days for parts to repair the only pistol before he can kill the poor man.  It's a great twist on a basic Western movie plot. Paul Gross does a very good job as The Montana Kid. He has excellent comedic timing and plays the character as a decent, too serious, frustrated man who has lost his way.  There is a sweet romance, but not too much to turn off the guys in the audience.  Sienna Guillory is a wonderful foil for Gross' comedy and, along with the rest of the ensemble, projects an innocent inability to understand this American's need for dueling and revenge.  The actors all have a wonderful talent for comedy, the Alberta setting is gorgeous, and the ending is very satisfactory.  This movie doesn't pretend to be great art, but it's a whole lot of fun.  I highly recommend it. (By the way, I understand that this may be the only Canadian Western in existence. It has an all Canadian cast, I think, and you can tell they had fun making.)",4,This was a lot of fun,1296518400,"02 1, 2011",2011,1284,"['bought', 'Gunless', 'like', 'Paul', 'Gross', 'work', 'wanted', 'see', 'new', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'disappoint', 'Gunless', 'very', 'funny', 'premise', 'Injured', 'American', 'gunfighter', 'run', 'Canadian', 'border', 'town', 'blacksmith', 'gun', 'duel', 'are', 'working', 'pistols', 'town', 'wait', 'around', 'days', 'parts', 'repair', 'only', 'pistol', 'can', 'kill', 'poor', 'man', 'great', 'twist', 'basic', 'Western', 'movie', 'plot', 'Paul', 'Gross', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'Montana', 'Kid', 'excellent', 'comedic', 'timing', 'character', 'decent', 'too', 'serious', 'frustrated', 'man', 'who', 'lost', 'way', 'sweet', 'romance', 'not', 'too', 'much', 'turn', 'off', 'guys', 'audience', 'Sienna', 'Guillory', 'wonderful', 'foil', 'Gross', 'comedy', 'rest', 'ensemble', 'projects', 'innocent', 'inability', 'understand', 'American', 'need', 'dueling', 'revenge', 'actors', 'have', 'wonderful', 'talent', 'comedy', 'Alberta', 'setting', 'gorgeous', 'ending', 'very', 'satisfactory', 'movie', ""n't"", 'pretend', 'be', 'great', 'art', 'whole', 'lot', 'fun', 'highly', 'recommend', 'way', 'understand', 'may', 'be', 'only', 'Canadian', 'Western', 'existence', 'Canadian', 'cast', 'think', 'can', 'tell', 'had', 'fun', 'making']",N/A

William Phillips, 2010, 89 minutes) is a smooth, elegant and totally Canadian period comedy that in my opinion is one of the funniest family Western films ever made. In fact I venture to call it one of the best Westerns ever made. What angers the living tar out of me is that I only just saw this on The Movie Channel. Because it is Canadian? Because it is one of the best films in existence? because we don't care about REAL film anymore?! I am tired of this missing out on films - I got to see this, at least. How many have I missed?Sean ""Montana Kid"" Lafferty (Paul Gross, best known as the cutie fromPasschendaelein a role that is a kind of cross between John Wayne and Bruce Campbell) is a sensitive American gunslinger who ambles up into the vicinity of Vancouver, British Columbia. He stumbles onto an eccentric little town with wonderful characters such as the friendly, lackadaisical doctor (Jay Brazeau) and the goofy Chinese laundry family. He settles in with a delightful English widow (Sienna Guillory) who chirps in a voice exactly like that of Haley Mills. The funniest action at this stage is Montana consulting with his horse, Glue, about serious issues - and the town's favorite cussword, ""Dang!""In awe at the newspaper reports about the new arrival, the townsfolk befriend him and charm him into revealing just how many men he's killed - the paper says seven, but there is a different and more accurate figure. On Montana's trail is the relentless bounty hunter Ben the Ear-cutter (Callum Keith Rennie, credited as Ben Cutler but I'm certain it's just Ben the Ear-cutter), whom Montana left with just his left ear. He loses Montana's trail a lot, because as Montana points out, Ben tends to lope to the right all the time. The final delight is the immortal Graham Greene as Two Dogs, sidekick to one of the local Mounties (cute-as-a-button Dustin Milligan).Is it the people, the country, the peace, that begins turning Montana around in his ways? I believe so. He goes out several times and completely forgets his gun - a lethal thing for such a man to do were he in the States. Montana begins to wonder about his ten-year career as a gunfighter ....This film rises above being a morality tale about guns and violence - the humor is too sophisticated and intelligent for that, and not just any old writer can accomplish such an undertaking. Several scenes and lines had me absolutely rolling on the floor, especially the outcome of a shoot-out Montana insists on having with the charming local blacksmith (Tyler Mane). This stuff approaches Shakespeare and Dickens - no kidding. While it allows the characters to walk along their individual paths, it deftly shows the smarter, kinder path without preaching aloud. The ending will turn all that on its head in the most hilarious scene ever filmed. Since I am not spoiling, I can only say this is more of a steady-rumbling-chuckle scene rather than a side-splitter.But the film has plenty of the latter too, and of a quality we don't really even know in America anymore. While there is homage to classics such asTrue Grit (1969), GUNLESS follows its own dusty trail. This film is reminiscent to me of the older comedies of the 1930s and 1940s - and I'm really afraid that comedy is dead in the U.S.A. As I often say about countries that give us good film and things, What would we do without Canada?Do not miss the chance to get this fantastic Canadian sleeper, filmed on location in Vancouver/British Columbia, that no doubt has become a cult classic by now.",5,"""I am what I do.""",1347840000,"09 17, 2012",2012,3546,"['GUNLESS', 'Writ./Dir', 'William', 'Phillips', '2010', '89', 'minutes', 'smooth', 'elegant', 'totally', 'Canadian', 'period', 'comedy', 'opinion', 'one', 'funniest', 'family', 'Western', 'films', 'ever', 'made', 'fact', 'venture', 'call', 'one', 'best', 'Westerns', 'ever', 'made', 'What', 'living', 'tar', 'only', 'just', 'saw', 'Movie', 'Channel', 'Canadian', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'existence', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'REAL', 'film', 'anymore', 'am', 'tired', 'missing', 'out', 'films', 'got', 'see', 'least', 'How', 'many', 'have', 'missed', 'Sean', 'Montana', 'Kid', 'Lafferty', 'Paul', 'Gross', 'best', 'known', 'cutie', 'fromPasschendaelein', 'role', 'kind', 'cross', 'John', 'Wayne', 'Bruce', 'Campbell', 'sensitive', 'American', 'gunslinger', 'who', 'up', 'vicinity', 'Vancouver', 'British', 'Columbia', 'eccentric', 'little', 'town', 'wonderful', 'characters', 'such', 'friendly', 'lackadaisical', 'doctor', 'Jay', 'Brazeau', 'goofy', 'Chinese', 'laundry', 'family', 'delightful', 'English', 'widow', 'Sienna', 'Guillory', 'who', 'chirps', 'voice', 'exactly', 'Haley', 'Mills', 'funniest', 'action', 'stage', 'Montana', 'consulting', 'horse', 'Glue', 'about', 'serious', 'issues', 'town', 'favorite', 'cussword', 'Dang', 'awe', 'newspaper', 'new', 'arrival', 'townsfolk', 'befriend', 'charm', 'revealing', 'just', 'how', 'many', 'men', 'killed', 'paper', 'seven', 'different', 'more', 'accurate', 'figure', 'Montana', 'trail', 'relentless', 'bounty', 'hunter', 'Ben', 'Ear-cutter', 'Callum', 'Keith', 'Rennie', 'credited', 'Ben', 'Cutler', ""'m"", 'certain', 'just', 'Ben', 'Ear-cutter', 'whom', 'Montana', 'left', 'just', 'left', 'ear', 'Montana', 'trail', 'lot', 'Montana', 'out', 'Ben', 'lope', 'right', 'time', 'final', 'delight', 'immortal', 'Graham', 'Greene', 'Two', 'Dogs', 'sidekick', 'one', 'local', 'Mounties', 'cute-as-a-button', 'Dustin', 'Milligan', 'people', 'country', 'peace', 'turning', 'Montana', 'ways', 'believe', 'so', 'out', 'several', 'times', 'completely', 'gun', 'lethal', 'thing', 'such', 'man', 'do', 'were', 'States', 'Montana', 'wonder', 'ten-year', 'career', 'gunfighter', '.This', 'film', 'rises', 'being', 'morality', 'tale', 'guns', 'violence', 'humor', 'too', 'sophisticated', 'intelligent', 'not', 'just', 'old', 'writer', 'can', 'accomplish', 'undertaking', 'Several', 'scenes', 'lines', 'had', 'absolutely', 'rolling', 'floor', 'especially', 'outcome', 'shoot-out', 'Montana', 'having', 'charming', 'local', 'blacksmith', 'Tyler', 'Mane', 'stuff', 'Shakespeare', 'Dickens', 'kidding', 'characters', 'walk', 'individual', 'paths', 'deftly', 'smarter', 'kinder', 'path', 'preaching', 'aloud', 'ending', 'will', 'turn', 'head', 'most', 'hilarious', 'scene', 'ever', 'filmed', 'am', 'not', 'spoiling', 'can', 'only', 'say', 'more', 'steady-rumbling-chuckle', 'scene', 'rather', 'side-splitter.But', 'film', 'plenty', 'latter', 'too', 'quality', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'even', 'know', 'America', 'anymore', 'homage', 'classics', 'such', 'asTrue', 'Grit', '1969', 'GUNLESS', 'own', 'dusty', 'trail', 'film', 'reminiscent', 'older', 'comedies', '1930s', '1940s', ""'m"", 'really', 'afraid', 'comedy', 'dead', 'U.S.A.', 'often', 'say', 'countries', 'give', 'good', 'film', 'things', 'What', 'would', 'do', 'Canada', 'Do', 'not', 'miss', 'chance', 'get', 'fantastic', 'Canadian', 'sleeper', 'filmed', 'location', 'Vancouver/British', 'Columbia', 'doubt', 'become', 'cult', 'classic', 'now']",N/A

Instead, Gunless veers clumsily between uncertainty and a definite lack of commitment to a specific style (one minute slapstick with a sword, the next minute shooting a boy's dog).  I found this peculiar blend of humor and a vain attempt to produce an old-fashioned western off-putting.  Even more disconcerting, and for no reason at all, the movie is also peppered with songs!  Paul Gross, who I normally like, does little more than pose and provide service as straight man to every loon thinking to set up a joke.  I cringed rather than chuckle.  This strange little movie doesn't work as a parody, satire, or a serious western.  But the worst offense was wasting the considerable talents of Graham Greene, reduced to sitting on a horse and saying very little.  Even a stand-in could have done his job!

I suppose this sort of ""fish out of water"" thing has been done before, but this is so lively and fresh it just plain feels brand new.Here's the scoop. Paul Gross, after dodging a hanging, finds himself in some bust-out Canadian town. He's on his horse, but he's been shot in the butt, rolled around in pig doo-doo and tied up. A long time bounty hunter/adversary is on his tail as he finds himself with an odd assortment of towns people who he must stay with (for at least a while) before he can get back on his horse and ride. It's that ""at least a while"" part that ends up messing with his head.This movie is a real hoot. It's peppered with an oddball bunch of characters and somehow the goofy plot line makes its own kind of sense. They're such a crazy bunch they create a good juxtaposition to Gross's character. Yes he's killed men. Many men. But he's not a bad guy. His sense of right and wrong just somehow got out of hand. Now he meets a girl to whom he's indebted and he starts to realize that the constant running, and his sense of justice, might not be the best way to live. It almost plays out out like an episode of the ""Andy Griffith Show.""It's set in a sparse part of Canada in a small town so the budget must have been manageable. But it doesn't look cheap. It's shot well and all the actors, even the secondary ones, do a really good job. You love these people and want to be with them. The music is good as well. There are a couple of quirky, tongue in cheek, tunes that help keep things light. This seems to be taking place in the late 19th century, but the language and many of the sensibilities are strictly ""now."" I don't know squat about Paul Gross but he handles his role extremely well. He's created a very memorable character. He reminds me a great deal of Josh Brolin. Sienna Guillroy is the love interest and she's quite fetching. These two make a fine pair.I cannot say enough about this movie. There is no wasted time here. It moves at a decent clip and will not test your sense of time. It's as entertaining as a movie can be and it has a good heart without being cheezy.

It is hilarious, and since I often have children in the mix for family movie night, it was important to me that it is refreshingly clean and innocent, too (I do, however, eject the DVD when the credits roll with the rather bawdy outtakes).The Montana Kid turns out to have engineering skills, and while waiting for a gunfight to materialize, he works on repairing a broken-down old pistol and helps a ranch owner improve her life (and her spread) by hooking a windmill up to her well.  A relationship of a rather amusing adversarial nature develops, each making the most of the other's flaws, but they have ample opportunity to see each other's strengths, too.  The gunslinger sees a tiny town of good, happy, quirky citizens, and because he's understandably tired of the killing and running, the entire picture starts to look pretty attractive to him.  He ponders making a better life.Canadians and Americans generally come from the same British stock and history, but the southern branch of the family tree often seems brash and considerably less civilized.
