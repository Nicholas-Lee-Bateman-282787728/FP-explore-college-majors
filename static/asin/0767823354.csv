She married the younger Antonio Banderas,who decided to direct her as a quirky killer housewife turned Hollywood diva.""Crazy in Alabama"" is a bizarre blend of two stories-a housewife who killed her husband&flees; to Hollywood,and that of a young Southern boy who is a witness to racial tensions and participates in the civil rights struggle of the '60s. The stories could've been melded well;instead,there is a constant,choppy bouncing between them.The voice-overs of the housewife (Griffith) and the boy (Lucas Black) are intrusive,an excuse for the director to tell instead of show.It's also heavy-handed. The housewife also carries her husband's head in a hatbox for most of the movie--which doesn't make sense. It's never explained why she's dragging the evidence of her murder everywhere she goes. The young boy's interracial friendship-and his growing maturity-could have been touching.His story is more compelling;Lucas Black is a talented young actor.He's convincing in his character's growth. There are excuses for celebrity cameos from Meat Loaf,Robert Wagner,George Foreman and Rod Steiger;but it doesn't further the movie. Melanie Griffith isn't convincing as an abused housewife or a mother of a large family;she's barely shown with her children,and there's no emotional connection. Instead,she plays a Southern belle Auntie Mame;campy,a drama queen,all glitter without substance.""Crazy in Alabama"" has only two redeeming points-the soundtrack is wonderful and the civil rights plot,while good,could've been handled better.

It's not that she is a terrible actress.  She is just annoying.  So why did I waste over 2 hours of my time watching this movie?  I am now asking myself the same thing.  I wasn't sure if this movie was supposed to be a comedy.  If it was, it wasn't even funny.  Griffith, plays Lucille, a woman who is beaten by her husband.  She kills him and cuts his head off...Why?  I have no idea.  Maybe she's crazy?  She then decides to leave her 7 children in the hands of her mother so she can go out to Hollywood and live out her dream of becoming a glamerous actress. She takes the head of her husband along for the ride...why not?  Nothing else makes sense so far so why not make less sense. This film is just a mishmash of nonsense.  She wins a lot of money in Las Vegas right before she gets to California. She eventually gets her big break...She is on t.v. Then, she gets caught..eventually all criminals do. I don't know what the ending of this movie is all about...She goes free?  when she was sentenced to a term in prison?  Maybe the book is better, I hope so, cuz this was a boring movie.  I watched it on cable....thank god i waited that long.The only bright spot was Lucas Black, the boy from Sling Blade.  He is one of the best child actors right now.

16896,A3CWH6VKCTJAD,0767823354,"""flickjunkie""","[5, 10]","SPOILER WARNING: This comment discusses the ending of this film in detail.  If you haven't seen the film, you might want to wait until you have seen it before you read this comment.This is a very likeable film about a  flaky woman and her family in 60's Alabama.  Lucille (Melanie Griffith) is  fleeing her small town because she just killed her husband and cut off his  head.  She left the body in her freezer and decided to take the head with  her as she embarks on her new career in Hollywood.  This is actually two  stories.  The first is Lucille's escapades and the second follows her young  nephew Peejoe back home, who finds himself in the middle of a civil rights  incident involving the death of a young black man who refuses to leave an  all white swimming pool.  Both stories are well done, but disparate.This is my first criticism of the Mark Childress screenplay based on his  own novel.  This story can't make up its mind whether it is a farce (the  Lucille story) or a serious drama about civil rights in the 1960's.  It  succeeds in both regards, but putting the two together takes impact and  credibility away from the serious civil rights story, which in my mind was  the better element.My second criticism was the ending.  Lucille is  tried and convicted of the first degree murder of her husband and is  sentenced to 20 years, (suspended) and five years of therapy, then set  free.  Although this panders shamelessly to the feel good audience, and  Lucille was a lovable character, films like this send the wrong message to  the masses regarding justice and accountability.  The message is that if  you are likeable, flaky and a victim, the rule of law doesn't have to apply  to you.  I feel that the film industry needs to take a little more  responsibility than this.When I saw the movie, I started out skeptical  about the prospects of a film directed by Antonio Banderas, even more since  his wife Melanie Griffith was cast in the lead.  I was pleasantly surprised  on both counts.  Banderas showed very solid direction, good camera work,  excellent period props (great vintage cars), and an attention to detail  that was impressive for a first time director.Melanie Griffith was the  best I can remember her since ""Working Girl"".  She was charmingly loopy and  brightened up every scene she was in.  But as good as she was, the best  performance was from young Lucas Black as Peejoe.  After a fine performance  in ""Sling Blade"" he proves it wasn't just a fluke.  Black has a natural,  plain spoken acting style with that heavy southern drawl which is I'm sure  must be close to his real accent.  He projects sincerity and character and  an inner strength far greater than one would expect for his years.  I look  forward to seeing more of his work.I rate this film 7/10.  It was a good  story with an identity crisis, but most people will have an easy time  liking this film.",4,Likeable film (SPOILER WARNING),955843200,"04 16, 2000",2000,2900,"['SPOILER', 'WARNING', 'comment', 'ending', 'film', 'detail', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'film', 'might', 'want', 'wait', 'have', 'seen', 'read', 'comment.This', 'very', 'likeable', 'film', 'flaky', 'woman', 'family', '60', 'Alabama', 'Lucille', 'Melanie', 'Griffith', 'fleeing', 'small', 'town', 'just', 'killed', 'husband', 'cut', 'off', 'head', 'left', 'body', 'freezer', 'decided', 'take', 'head', 'new', 'career', 'Hollywood', 'actually', 'two', 'stories', 'first', 'Lucille', 'escapades', 'second', 'young', 'nephew', 'Peejoe', 'back', 'home', 'who', 'middle', 'civil', 'rights', 'incident', 'involving', 'death', 'young', 'black', 'man', 'who', 'leave', 'white', 'swimming', 'pool', 'stories', 'are', 'well', 'done', 'disparate.This', 'first', 'criticism', 'Mark', 'Childress', 'screenplay', 'based', 'own', 'novel', 'story', 'ca', ""n't"", 'make', 'up', 'mind', 'farce', 'Lucille', 'story', 'serious', 'drama', 'civil', 'rights', '1960', 'regards', 'putting', 'two', 'together', 'impact', 'credibility', 'away', 'serious', 'civil', 'rights', 'story', 'mind', 'was', 'better', 'element.My', 'second', 'criticism', 'was', 'ending', 'Lucille', 'tried', 'convicted', 'first', 'degree', 'murder', 'husband', 'sentenced', '20', 'years', 'suspended', 'five', 'years', 'therapy', 'then', 'set', 'free', 'panders', 'shamelessly', 'feel', 'good', 'audience', 'Lucille', 'was', 'lovable', 'character', 'films', 'send', 'wrong', 'message', 'masses', 'regarding', 'justice', 'accountability', 'message', 'are', 'likeable', 'flaky', 'victim', 'rule', 'law', ""n't"", 'have', 'apply', 'feel', 'film', 'industry', 'take', 'little', 'more', 'responsibility', 'this.When', 'saw', 'movie', 'started', 'out', 'skeptical', 'prospects', 'film', 'directed', 'Antonio', 'Banderas', 'even', 'more', 'wife', 'Melanie', 'Griffith', 'was', 'cast', 'lead', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'counts', 'Banderas', 'showed', 'very', 'solid', 'direction', 'good', 'camera', 'work', 'excellent', 'period', 'props', 'great', 'vintage', 'cars', 'attention', 'detail', 'was', 'impressive', 'first', 'time', 'director.Melanie', 'Griffith', 'was', 'best', 'can', 'remember', 'Working', 'Girl', 'was', 'charmingly', 'loopy', 'brightened', 'up', 'scene', 'was', 'as', 'good', 'was', 'best', 'performance', 'was', 'young', 'Lucas', 'Black', 'Peejoe', 'fine', 'performance', 'Sling', 'Blade', 'was', ""n't"", 'just', 'fluke', 'Black', 'natural', 'plain', 'spoken', 'acting', 'style', 'heavy', 'southern', 'drawl', ""'m"", 'sure', 'must', 'be', 'close', 'real', 'accent', 'projects', 'sincerity', 'character', 'inner', 'strength', 'far', 'greater', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'years', 'look', 'forward', 'seeing', 'more', 'work.I', 'rate', 'film', '7/10', 'was', 'good', 'story', 'identity', 'crisis', 'most', 'people', 'will', 'have', 'easy', 'time', 'liking', 'film']",N/A

16901,A152C8GYY25HAH,0767823354,Matthew Horner,"[8, 13]","The DVD included an interview with director Antonio Banderas. I mention this because he introduced some of the movie's out takes. In doing so, he said that the original rough cut ran three and a half hours and that cutting it to its present length was very difficult. I am of the 'shorter is better' film school, but, in this case, I would be curious to see the long version. I suspect that Carzy in Alabama's heart wound up on the cutting room floor.In the movie, as in the book, thirteen-year old Peejoe [Lucas Black] narrates two stories. These are two life-altering events that happened to him in his hometown of Industry, Alabama in 1965. One is about about how his Aunt Lucille [Melanie Griffith] kills her abusive husband with rat posioning, parks her seven kids with her mother and drives to California to be a star. The other concerns his witnessing the killing of a young black boy by the local sheriff during a sit-in at a local public swimming pool. Both stories are about the high price of freedom.Carzy in Alabama is very professionally done. It's equal parts sweet and bitter-sweet. The bad thing is that it also has very little substance. Imagine that you are driving down a long, tree-lined driveway. You arrive at a large, beautiful house. You are impressed by your surroundings. You enter the house, which is beautifully decorated, except for one glaring detail - there are no furnishings. You find there are not even any clothes in the closets. That's what movies such as Crazy in Alabama are like. Impressive looking yet sadly empty.This hollowness is not the fault of the actors. What we see of them is quite good. I suspect that the only way to really judge their performance would be to see the rest of the footage. There is a scene during Lucille's trial where she points at a woman in the gallery. She says that she knew all along that this woman, her best friend, had been having an affair with her now dead husband. As if to prove the point, the woman flees the court room in tears. The problem with this scene is that it's the first and last time the audience sees Lucille's best friend. So, the moment lacks impact. I can't blame Banderas. In fact, he seems to have had little problem in directing the cast or in supervising the photography. I can't point the finger at the book's author, because I haven't read it. There is only one place I can lay the blame. The movie's distributor was afraid to release a three-hour version of a film that wasn't very commercial to begin with. [You can tell when a studio has a problem picture when the trailers have virtually nothing to do with the storyline.] I believe that, if you know you are going to lose your investment, why does it matter how long the product runs? Isn't getting praise from a limited audience some kind of consolation?Because it is so badly edited, Crazy in Alabama is unable to tell either of its two stories well. You don't get enough background to relate to Lucille's insisting she had no other option than to kill her husband. She comes across as self-centered, which surely was not the movie's intent.

Melanie Griffith is ALMOST perfect as Aunt Lucille.  She sure is charming and fun in the role.  But it should have  been established right from the get-go that Aunt Lucille is no spring  chicken.  At 40 or 41 (when this film was made), Miss Griffith is no  &quot;34 years old&quot; as the radio announcer in the getaway car says.In the book a talent scout saw Lucille in a community theatre production  of The Sound of Music.  He saw &quot;star quality and talent&quot; in her  small role.  So when he invites her to look him up in Hollywood, you can  believe that he will cast her in a TV show.  But in the movie we are asked  to believe Lucille merely sent in her head shots and ALL OF HOLLYWOOD has  gone crazy over her and -- SIGHT UNSEEN -- she is offered a role in  Bewitched.

16904,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,0767823354,Roland E. Zwick,"[4, 13]","&quot;Crazy in Alabama,&quot; the directorial debut of Antonio Banderas, tries desperately to live up to its title yet simply emerges as deep-fried Southern malarkey garnished with social significance. What the plotters had  in mind with this overbaked concoction is truly beyond the powers of mere  mortal understanding.The Mark Childress screenplay is a textbook case  study of narrative schizophrenia run amok. Melanie Griffith, obviously past  her darling ingenue stage and heading into the career sunset of doddering,  crazy aunt roles, plays the stereotypical Southern lunatic who has  decapitated her abusive husband, packed his head in a tupperware container  she carries with her in a hatbox and headed off (pardon the pun) to find  fame and glory in the spotlight of 1960's Hollywood. Almost tangetially,  the film also concerns itself with her nephew, Peejoe, and his experiences  that summer involving a clash between blacks and whites over a segregated  swimming pool in the small southern town in which he lives.To say that  the filmmakers fail to coalesce these elements into a coherent whole would  be a masterpiece of understatement. This actually seems to be two  completely different films rubbing up against one another and not liking  each other very much. The audience, as a result, is left in a state of  headscratching and, occasionally, even jawdropping  confusion.Unfortunately, the film fails to work as either a freewheeling  black comedy or as an incisive social document. As in so many films dealing  with the issue of civil rights, the blacks play secondary roles in their  own story, standing in the background as part of a mob rather than stepping  forth as fully developed, fully rounded characters in their own right.It  also seems odd that a film which approaches this issue in such highminded  and reverential terms tries, at the same time, to pass off a serious mental  illness as a quaintly admirable example of freespirited non-conformity. The  film suffers from a terminal grinding of tonal gears. Who could ever  imagine that the same film would feature a recreation of an appearance by  Martin Luther King Jr. and the filming of a &quot;Bewitched&quot; episode -  and believe that such a coupling could ever result in a meaningful  marriage? It is a testament to the utter absurdity and hopelessness of the  entire enterprise.Drawing a parallel between a woman who cuts her  husband's head off and a group of black people fighting for equal rights  and uncritically calling both examples of &quot;freedom&quot; equal to one  another insults those involved in the noble latter cause. And not all the  scenes of phony emotional uplift at the end - a scanning of tear soaked  faces at a ludicrous trial, a shot of Griffith, standing through a sun-roof  riding off into the sunset, arms raised in a victory salute - can mitigate  the tastelessness at the film's core.&quot;Crazy in Alabama&quot; simply  proves that, for an offbeat film to be successful, an attempt has to be  made to blend the disparate elements of plotting and tone into an organic  whole. As it is, &quot;Crazy in Alabama&quot; is merely weird without being  any fun.",2,pure nonsensical drivel,964310400,"07 23, 2000",2000,3176,"['quot', 'Crazy', 'Alabama', 'quot', 'directorial', 'debut', 'Antonio', 'Banderas', 'desperately', 'live', 'up', 'title', 'yet', 'simply', 'deep-fried', 'Southern', 'malarkey', 'garnished', 'social', 'significance', 'What', 'plotters', 'had', 'mind', 'overbaked', 'concoction', 'truly', 'powers', 'mere', 'mortal', 'understanding.The', 'Mark', 'Childress', 'screenplay', 'textbook', 'case', 'study', 'narrative', 'schizophrenia', 'run', 'amok', 'Melanie', 'Griffith', 'obviously', 'darling', 'ingenue', 'stage', 'heading', 'career', 'sunset', 'doddering', 'crazy', 'aunt', 'roles', 'stereotypical', 'Southern', 'lunatic', 'who', 'decapitated', 'abusive', 'husband', 'packed', 'head', 'tupperware', 'container', 'hatbox', 'headed', 'off', 'pardon', 'pun', 'find', 'fame', 'glory', 'spotlight', '1960', 'Hollywood', 'Almost', 'tangetially', 'film', 'also', 'nephew', 'Peejoe', 'experiences', 'summer', 'involving', 'clash', 'blacks', 'whites', 'segregated', 'swimming', 'pool', 'small', 'southern', 'town', 'say', 'filmmakers', 'fail', 'coalesce', 'elements', 'coherent', 'whole', 'would', 'be', 'masterpiece', 'understatement', 'actually', 'be', 'two', 'completely', 'different', 'films', 'rubbing', 'up', 'one', 'not', 'liking', 'other', 'very', 'much', 'audience', 'result', 'left', 'state', 'headscratching', 'occasionally', 'even', 'jawdropping', 'confusion.Unfortunately', 'film', 'work', 'freewheeling', 'black', 'comedy', 'incisive', 'social', 'document', 'so', 'many', 'films', 'dealing', 'issue', 'civil', 'rights', 'blacks', 'play', 'secondary', 'roles', 'own', 'story', 'standing', 'background', 'part', 'mob', 'rather', 'stepping', 'forth', 'fully', 'developed', 'fully', 'rounded', 'characters', 'own', 'right.It', 'also', 'odd', 'film', 'issue', 'such', 'highminded', 'reverential', 'terms', 'tries', 'same', 'time', 'pass', 'off', 'serious', 'mental', 'illness', 'quaintly', 'admirable', 'example', 'freespirited', 'non-conformity', 'film', 'suffers', 'terminal', 'grinding', 'tonal', 'gears', 'Who', 'could', 'ever', 'imagine', 'same', 'film', 'would', 'feature', 'recreation', 'appearance', 'Martin', 'Luther', 'King', 'Jr.', 'filming', 'quot', 'Bewitched', 'quot', 'believe', 'coupling', 'could', 'ever', 'result', 'meaningful', 'marriage', 'testament', 'utter', 'absurdity', 'hopelessness', 'entire', 'enterprise.Drawing', 'parallel', 'woman', 'who', 'husband', 'head', 'group', 'black', 'people', 'fighting', 'equal', 'rights', 'uncritically', 'calling', 'examples', 'quot', 'freedom', 'quot', 'equal', 'one', 'insults', 'involved', 'noble', 'latter', 'cause', 'not', 'scenes', 'phony', 'emotional', 'uplift', 'end', 'scanning', 'tear', 'soaked', 'ludicrous', 'trial', 'shot', 'Griffith', 'standing', 'sun-roof', 'riding', 'off', 'sunset', 'arms', 'raised', 'victory', 'salute', 'can', 'mitigate', 'tastelessness', 'film', 'core.', 'quot', 'Crazy', 'Alabama', 'quot', 'simply', 'offbeat', 'film', 'be', 'successful', 'attempt', 'be', 'made', 'blend', 'disparate', 'elements', 'plotting', 'tone', 'organic', 'whole', 'quot', 'Crazy', 'Alabama', 'quot', 'merely', 'weird', 'being', 'fun']",N/A

She's had enough, so she cut his off and headed for Hollywood to pursue her acting career, leaving her kids and friends behind in Alabama. She carried his dead husband's head in a big hat box along for the ride. The police are trying to track her down.She landed a gig in a TV show and became a big star over night.

Melanie got arrested and was sent back to Alabama. Everyone treated her like a star when she arrived.The courtroom scene was the climatic part of the film when Melanie gets to tell her story as a victim of abuse and trying to win the simpathy of the jury. I was so moved by this scene, and Melanie commands absolute attention, because she's very real and powerful emotionally.
