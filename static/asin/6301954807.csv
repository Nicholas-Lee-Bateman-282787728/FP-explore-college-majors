274017,A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z,6301954807,Annie Van Auken,"[4, 4]","When I was a kid, HOUDINI (1953) with Tony Curtis and Janet Leigh was always broadcast in October, usually as a Saturday afternoon movie.There are two mentions in it of Halloween.The first happens when Harry and Bess Houdini visit a magician's convention on Halloween night. Unhappy Harry failed at magic and took a job in a lock factory at his wife's urging, but when given the opportunity to go on stage as one of five challengers who must try to escape from strait jackets, Harry jumps at it. He wins the contest and his prize is a single round-trip ticket to Europe. Eventually the couple trades it for two one-way ducats. Harry and Bess find fame in Britain and on the Continent and then repeat their success in America.The second Halloween reference is to a near-tragic stunt held on Halloween afternoon: an escape from a locked trunk submerged in the iced-over Detroit River. When he emerges from the trunk, Harry's swept downstream by the current, can't find the large hole cut in the ice and nearly drowns and/or freezes to death.Despite that and a sad ending, this is generally an upbeat film. Colorful re-creations of late 19th Century sideshows are fun and so are the many magic tricks and escapes. Also, Leigh and Curtis make a most pulchritudinous couple and are clearly in love (for real!).I recommend HOUDINI to all as a pleasant October diversion.BTW-- does the Detroit River REALLY ice over before October 31st and is the outside temperature ZERO degrees in the DAYTIME?

Tony Curtis and Janet Leigh, young and in love in real life, do a great job of playing Harry and Bess Houdini. An amateur magician himself, Curtis gives a great performance in the first really good role of his career. There will be many to come. What's accurate about this film? Most of the escapes shown in the film such as when Houdini allowed himself to be hung upside down outside of a tall building while confined in a strait jacket, his offering and succeeding to escape from any pair of handcuffs that his audiences could produce, and his decision to go through with being locked in a box submerged in water while he himself is bound in chains.What's inaccurate in the film? It's more a matter of what is omitted. The film does mention Houdini's running battle with spiritualists. What it doesn't mention is Houdini's tiff with Sir Arthur Conan Doyle over the whole issue. The depth and length of this disagreement is considerable, though, and it's understandable that in a film not of documentary length that it had to be left out.Sadly enough, the film has only a trailer as an extra feature.A commentary track, an actual documentary, or even - if it was possible - to include the excellent 1976 made-for-TV film ""The Great Houdini"" with Paul Michael Glaser in the title role would have made for a better package. That 70's version of Houdini's life gives more details about what made the man tick, even if there is something about its atmosphere that transports one back to the days of disco.

You'll see him sitting hopefully at a s&eacute;ance, awaiting words from his departed mother. Houdini spent his life exposing frauds and working with Congress on legislation to deal with such fraud. Even film critics indicate this film ""contains several factual errors"" ... insult! It is one huge factual error!The entire film plays out badly, short-shrifting Houdini's true accomplishments, as if someone trying to blacken his name had made this thing.

274039,A3O2RCKAMSE9X7,6301954807,Martin Asiner,"[2, 3]","HOUDINI is not meant as a movie that is true to life. If it were, then the finished product might have been more factual but less entertaining. Tony Curtis plays Houdini as a young Jewish man who seeks more than the dullish life that as Erich Weiss he was born into. Early on, the audience learns that the solid, conservative life that his family thought to place him is simply not in his plans. He makes a rational analysis as to how he can make the leap from the ordinary to the extraordinary. It is in showmanship that he will excel. With no small amount of humor, Curtis gives Houdini a patina of technical virtuosity with escapes combined with razzle-dazzle country fair sideshow barking. This reaching out for the seemingly unobtainable for one of his humble class extends even to his choice of a wife. He marries a woman whom he feel sure that his mother will reject. For one of the few times in his life,he is wrong. Mama Weiss eagerly embraces her new daughter-in-law.The force of this film lies not in the continuity of the Houdini character from scene to scene. Rather, the intensity lies in a series of vignettes, each roughly pointing Houdini in the same direction: to ever newer and more dangerous escapes. Most people who discuss this movie point to the grand finale, the Chinese Water Torture Chamber scene, where Houdini is very nearly killed in attempting an impossible escape. This scene is dramatic certainly, but I see it as only the culmination of a long series of lesser escapes, with paradoxically the most interesting one occurring at the midpoint. Shortly after his marriage, Houdini and his wife attend a dinner in which the MC dares volunteers from the audience to wriggle out of a straight jacket. Houdini leaps at the chance and along with several others attempts to escape. What distinguishes this escape from the climatic Chinese Water Torture escape is the focus on the man, rather than on the gimmick. As the stalwart young man leap and crash off the stage, attempting to break out of their bonds, Houdini stands motionless. He stares at a twirling chandelier, almost as if he were summoning up his inner chi for the strength and flexibility to escape. Ever so slowly, he maneuvers his fingers which appear behind his back. The audience in the ballroom and the audience in the theater collectively let out a gasp of surprise. Sweat drenched, Houdini tosses off the jacket to win first prize. It is this scene, and others like it that lend this biopic its emotional wallop. The tragedy of the movie is not unlike the tragedy of the man. Had Houdini retained a bit more of the Erich Weiss latent within him, his life might not have ended prematurely either on film or in real life.",4,Houdini: The Escape from Humdrum to Stardom,1023753600,"06 11, 2002",2002,2713,"['HOUDINI', 'not', 'meant', 'movie', 'true', 'life', 'were', 'then', 'finished', 'product', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'factual', 'less', 'entertaining', 'Tony', 'Curtis', 'Houdini', 'young', 'Jewish', 'man', 'who', 'more', 'dullish', 'life', 'Erich', 'Weiss', 'was', 'born', 'Early', 'audience', 'solid', 'conservative', 'life', 'family', 'thought', 'place', 'simply', 'not', 'plans', 'rational', 'analysis', 'how', 'can', 'make', 'leap', 'ordinary', 'extraordinary', 'showmanship', 'will', 'excel', 'small', 'amount', 'humor', 'Curtis', 'Houdini', 'patina', 'technical', 'virtuosity', 'escapes', 'combined', 'razzle-dazzle', 'country', 'fair', 'sideshow', 'barking', 'reaching', 'out', 'seemingly', 'unobtainable', 'one', 'humble', 'class', 'even', 'choice', 'wife', 'woman', 'whom', 'feel', 'sure', 'mother', 'will', 'reject', 'one', 'few', 'times', 'life', 'wrong', 'Mama', 'Weiss', 'eagerly', 'new', 'daughter-in-law.The', 'force', 'film', 'not', 'continuity', 'Houdini', 'character', 'scene', 'scene', 'Rather', 'intensity', 'series', 'vignettes', 'roughly', 'pointing', 'Houdini', 'same', 'direction', 'ever', 'newer', 'more', 'dangerous', 'escapes', 'Most', 'people', 'who', 'discuss', 'movie', 'point', 'grand', 'finale', 'Chinese', 'Water', 'Torture', 'Chamber', 'scene', 'where', 'Houdini', 'very', 'nearly', 'killed', 'attempting', 'impossible', 'escape', 'scene', 'dramatic', 'certainly', 'see', 'only', 'culmination', 'long', 'series', 'lesser', 'escapes', 'paradoxically', 'most', 'interesting', 'one', 'occurring', 'midpoint', 'Shortly', 'marriage', 'Houdini', 'wife', 'attend', 'dinner', 'MC', 'volunteers', 'audience', 'wriggle', 'straight', 'jacket', 'Houdini', 'chance', 'several', 'others', 'attempts', 'escape', 'What', 'escape', 'climatic', 'Chinese', 'Water', 'Torture', 'escape', 'focus', 'man', 'rather', 'gimmick', 'stalwart', 'young', 'man', 'leap', 'crash', 'stage', 'attempting', 'break', 'bonds', 'Houdini', 'motionless', 'twirling', 'chandelier', 'almost', 'were', 'summoning', 'up', 'inner', 'chi', 'strength', 'flexibility', 'escape', 'Ever', 'so', 'slowly', 'fingers', 'appear', 'back', 'audience', 'ballroom', 'audience', 'theater', 'collectively', 'let', 'out', 'gasp', 'surprise', 'Sweat', 'drenched', 'Houdini', 'jacket', 'win', 'first', 'prize', 'scene', 'others', 'lend', 'biopic', 'emotional', 'wallop', 'tragedy', 'movie', 'not', 'tragedy', 'man', 'Had', 'Houdini', 'retained', 'bit', 'more', 'Erich', 'Weiss', 'latent', 'life', 'might', 'not', 'have', 'ended', 'prematurely', 'film', 'real', 'life']",N/A

274055,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,6301954807,trebe,"[3, 3]","The life of Harry Houdini (1874-1926), at the time the most famous magician in the world, is given the Hollywood treatment in Houdini (1953), with Tony Curtis starring as the Great Houdini, the legendary illusionist and escape artist.  Janet Leigh, married to Curtis at the time, appears as Houdini's wife Bess.  Leigh looks stunning, and gives a very solid performance, as Houdini's partner for life, both on and off the stage.The film hits some of the high points of the magician's colorful life, embellishing the truth for dramatic purposes.  Curtis certainly shines in his portrayal, bringing a lot of flair and charm to the role.  The early part of the movie recounts Houdini's humble beginnings in vaudeville, his romance and marriage to Bess, and the period where the couple lived with Houdini's mother (Angela Clarke), who remained a major influence in his life.With Bess as his assistant, Harry focused on becoming an escape artist and illusionist, working to master the opening of locks, handcuffs, and eventually safes.  Winning a prize provides the opportunity for the Houdini's to journey to England, where Harry gains more notoriety after escaping from a prison cell.  Performing in Europe, Houdini's career takes off.  While mostly based on some elements of truth, the film features a mysterious German magician named Johann Von Schweger, who Houdini unsuccessfully attempts to contact many times.  After Von Schweger passes away, in another strange development, Von Schweger's assistant Otto (Torin Thatcher), becomes Houdini's loyal aide.Returning to America, the magician works to establish himself as a performer.  Tragedy strikes, when Houdini's mother passes away while he is in Detroit, attempting to escape from a crate dropped through a hole in the ice on a frozen river.  The stunt nearly claims Houdini's life, but he claims that his mother's voice mysteriously guided him to safety.  This event causes Houdini to stop performing, and explore the possibility of communicating with the spirits of the dead, and debunking fake mediums.  Houdini eventually returns to performing, attempting more spectacular tricks.  The dangerous pagoda water torture cell escape is eliminated from the act, until the audience demands that Houdini perform it.Houdini the movie, is quite entertaining, and while not entirely accurate, gets a lot of things right while building up the mystique surrounding the famous magician.  It's understandable that Houdini's death from appendicitis was dramatized, and it doesn't matter that Bess was actually a brunette, but the whole Von Schweger storyline is a curious element, as the filmmakers seem bent of playing up the supernatural angle.  Rather than being the cause of his death, the water torture cell escape was a trick that Houdini successfully performed for many years.  The makeup effects are nicely done, as the Houdini's both age gracefully through the course of the film.  With some impressive set designs, and winning performances from Curtis and Leigh, Houdini rates a solid 4.5 stars.  The film would earn a 5 star rating, if not for the various factual inconsistencies.",4,Tony Curtis shines as the legendary magician...,1315699200,"09 11, 2011",2011,3134,"['life', 'Harry', 'Houdini', '1874-1926', 'time', 'most', 'famous', 'magician', 'world', 'given', 'Hollywood', 'treatment', 'Houdini', '1953', 'Tony', 'Curtis', 'starring', 'Great', 'Houdini', 'legendary', 'illusionist', 'escape', 'artist', 'Janet', 'Leigh', 'married', 'Curtis', 'time', 'Houdini', 'wife', 'Bess', 'Leigh', 'stunning', 'very', 'solid', 'performance', 'Houdini', 'partner', 'life', 'stage.The', 'film', 'high', 'points', 'magician', 'colorful', 'life', 'embellishing', 'truth', 'dramatic', 'purposes', 'Curtis', 'certainly', 'portrayal', 'bringing', 'lot', 'flair', 'charm', 'role', 'early', 'part', 'movie', 'Houdini', 'humble', 'beginnings', 'vaudeville', 'romance', 'marriage', 'Bess', 'period', 'where', 'couple', 'lived', 'Houdini', 'mother', 'Angela', 'Clarke', 'who', 'remained', 'major', 'influence', 'life.With', 'Bess', 'assistant', 'Harry', 'focused', 'becoming', 'escape', 'artist', 'illusionist', 'working', 'master', 'opening', 'locks', 'handcuffs', 'eventually', 'safes', 'Winning', 'prize', 'opportunity', 'Houdini', 'journey', 'England', 'where', 'Harry', 'gains', 'more', 'notoriety', 'escaping', 'prison', 'cell', 'Performing', 'Europe', 'Houdini', 'career', 'off', 'mostly', 'based', 'elements', 'truth', 'film', 'mysterious', 'German', 'magician', 'named', 'Johann', 'Von', 'Schweger', 'who', 'Houdini', 'unsuccessfully', 'contact', 'many', 'times', 'Von', 'Schweger', 'away', 'strange', 'development', 'Von', 'Schweger', 'assistant', 'Otto', 'Torin', 'Thatcher', 'Houdini', 'loyal', 'aide.Returning', 'America', 'magician', 'establish', 'performer', 'Tragedy', 'strikes', 'when', 'Houdini', 'mother', 'away', 'Detroit', 'attempting', 'escape', 'crate', 'dropped', 'hole', 'ice', 'frozen', 'river', 'stunt', 'nearly', 'Houdini', 'life', 'mother', 'voice', 'mysteriously', 'guided', 'safety', 'event', 'Houdini', 'stop', 'performing', 'explore', 'possibility', 'communicating', 'spirits', 'dead', 'debunking', 'fake', 'mediums', 'Houdini', 'eventually', 'performing', 'attempting', 'more', 'spectacular', 'tricks', 'dangerous', 'pagoda', 'water', 'torture', 'cell', 'escape', 'eliminated', 'act', 'audience', 'Houdini', 'perform', 'movie', 'quite', 'entertaining', 'not', 'entirely', 'accurate', 'lot', 'things', 'right', 'building', 'up', 'mystique', 'surrounding', 'famous', 'magician', 'understandable', 'Houdini', 'death', 'appendicitis', 'was', 'dramatized', ""n't"", 'matter', 'Bess', 'was', 'actually', 'brunette', 'whole', 'Von', 'Schweger', 'storyline', 'curious', 'element', 'filmmakers', 'seem', 'bent', 'playing', 'up', 'supernatural', 'angle', 'Rather', 'being', 'cause', 'death', 'water', 'torture', 'cell', 'escape', 'was', 'trick', 'Houdini', 'successfully', 'performed', 'many', 'years', 'makeup', 'effects', 'are', 'nicely', 'done', 'Houdini', 'age', 'gracefully', 'course', 'film', 'impressive', 'set', 'designs', 'winning', 'performances', 'Curtis', 'Leigh', 'Houdini', 'rates', 'solid', '4.5', 'stars', 'film', 'would', 'earn', '5', 'star', 'rating', 'not', 'various', 'factual', 'inconsistencies']",N/A
