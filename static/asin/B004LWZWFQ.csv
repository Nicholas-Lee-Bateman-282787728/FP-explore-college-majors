Poor Flash...I thought he was poorly developed, and only surfaced in the story to do things that had to happen to move the story along. Is it possible for two people to have a weird relationship like Flash and Peter? Of course! But it didn't feel like a relationship, just a push-button character, angry one moment, then slightly thoughtful, on to startingly understanding, and finally comic relief. Yeah, weird.Some nice choreography, though less special effects and a tighter plot line would've been appreciated.  And I think I would've slapped Peter, not kissed him. Disrespectful, creepy teenager. Shudder... Something about the actor's approach to kissing made me think of a cobra swaying to a charmer's flute.

1417481,A1R8LZYZR3377O,B004LWZWFQ,ajsteele,"[1, 3]","My title says what you must do to fairly critique The Amazing Spiderman. The first Spiderman was good for it's time but watching both back to back, The Amazing Spiderman is a more mature film. It struck a much deeper tone by doing away with the constant camp the first film led with. Peter Parker developing his own web concoction as depicted in the comics is what I've always wanted to see. I thought making Spiderman too web organic in the original just flopped and made Spiderman much weirder than necessary.The Amazing Spiderman is a very good film but had a shortcoming as well. That being the Lizard's face being completely wrong. He needed an elongated lizard face. They didn't need an exact construction of a lizard as the extra features stressed was done. Remember how that killed Godzilla 1998? In addition his tongue was almost never seen and it could have been used in cool ways. Fortunately this was not a complete setback as the rest of the film more than compensated. Plus, the actual pathos of the Lizard remained intact.Andrew Garfield as Spiderman pulled this off big-time. You've heard it a million times already but the chemistry between Emma Stone (Gwen Stacy) and Garfield was screen magic unfolding and can not be understated. It's a genuine teen romance that the viewer can actually care about. What empathy could you pull up for MJ in the original? Lets face it, she  came off as a prissy teen that embraced Parker after near death.  I'm glad this film was made and it was not ""too soon"" or ""unnecessary"". How many times has Spiderman gone through character metamorphosis in print? The art of film -making should be no different. Yes we all have preferences for films and we should leave it at that without putting a halt on artistic expression, especially if it's grounded..The first film(s) somewhat rushed through the growth of Spiderman  This film really has some meat on it and the relationships are more realistic than ever. The new costume blows away any prior live action spectacle of Spiderman. Spiderman's body movements are solid and this includes the astonishing web slinging and swinging action scenes that made me want to press the replay button with true anticipation this time.Onto the blu ray quality. Totally incredible. I've been on top of blu ray since it's inception and this exceeds any picture quality (except The Expendables 2-which was no great movie, but kicked a** on action)that I personally have seen to date. The sound, awesome. When I first heard that Spiderman was being redone instead of a Spiderman 4, I was disappointed. Shockingly, I was wrong. Now I see why it needed to be made. The bonus features which are deeper than usual (and in hi def)expound upon these issues and make sense for a change. Outside of a few bumps, this Amazing Spiderman was well thought out and captured the Peter Parker dilemma with darkness like no other and left the silliness behind.",5,Watch Spidey 1 and reboot back to back.,1353715200,"11 24, 2012",2012,2923,"['title', 'what', 'must', 'do', 'fairly', 'critique', 'Amazing', 'Spiderman', 'first', 'Spiderman', 'was', 'good', 'time', 'watching', 'back', 'back', 'Amazing', 'Spiderman', 'more', 'mature', 'film', 'struck', 'much', 'deeper', 'tone', 'doing', 'away', 'constant', 'camp', 'first', 'film', 'led', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'developing', 'own', 'web', 'concoction', 'depicted', 'comics', 'what', ""'ve"", 'always', 'wanted', 'see', 'thought', 'making', 'Spiderman', 'too', 'web', 'organic', 'original', 'just', 'flopped', 'made', 'Spiderman', 'much', 'weirder', 'necessary.The', 'Amazing', 'Spiderman', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'had', 'shortcoming', 'as', 'well', 'being', 'Lizard', 'face', 'being', 'completely', 'wrong', 'needed', 'elongated', 'lizard', 'face', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'exact', 'construction', 'lizard', 'extra', 'features', 'stressed', 'was', 'done', 'Remember', 'how', 'killed', 'Godzilla', '1998', 'addition', 'tongue', 'was', 'almost', 'never', 'seen', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'used', 'cool', 'ways', 'Fortunately', 'was', 'not', 'complete', 'setback', 'rest', 'film', 'more', 'compensated', 'actual', 'pathos', 'Lizard', 'remained', 'intact.Andrew', 'Garfield', 'Spiderman', 'pulled', 'off', 'big-time', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'million', 'times', 'already', 'chemistry', 'Emma', 'Stone', 'Gwen', 'Stacy', 'Garfield', 'was', 'screen', 'magic', 'unfolding', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'understated', 'genuine', 'teen', 'romance', 'viewer', 'can', 'actually', 'care', 'What', 'empathy', 'could', 'pull', 'up', 'MJ', 'original', 'Lets', 'face', 'came', 'off', 'prissy', 'teen', 'embraced', 'Parker', 'death', ""'m"", 'glad', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'was', 'not', 'too', 'soon', 'unnecessary', 'How', 'many', 'times', 'Spiderman', 'gone', 'character', 'metamorphosis', 'print', 'art', 'film', '-making', 'should', 'be', 'different', 'Yes', 'have', 'preferences', 'films', 'should', 'leave', 'putting', 'halt', 'artistic', 'expression', 'especially', 'grounded..The', 'first', 'film', 'somewhat', 'rushed', 'growth', 'Spiderman', 'film', 'really', 'meat', 'relationships', 'are', 'more', 'realistic', 'ever', 'new', 'costume', 'away', 'prior', 'live', 'action', 'spectacle', 'Spiderman', 'Spiderman', 'body', 'movements', 'are', 'solid', 'astonishing', 'web', 'slinging', 'swinging', 'action', 'scenes', 'made', 'want', 'press', 'replay', 'button', 'true', 'anticipation', 'blu', 'ray', 'quality', 'Totally', 'incredible', ""'ve"", 'been', 'top', 'blu', 'ray', 'inception', 'picture', 'quality', 'Expendables', '2-which', 'was', 'great', 'movie', 'kicked', 'a**', 'action', 'personally', 'have', 'seen', 'date', 'sound', 'awesome', 'When', 'first', 'heard', 'Spiderman', 'was', 'being', 'redone', 'instead', 'Spiderman', '4', 'was', 'disappointed', 'Shockingly', 'was', 'wrong', 'Now', 'see', 'why', 'needed', 'be', 'made', 'bonus', 'features', 'are', 'deeper', 'usual', 'hi', 'def', 'expound', 'issues', 'make', 'sense', 'change', 'few', 'bumps', 'Amazing', 'Spiderman', 'was', 'well', 'thought', 'out', 'captured', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'dilemma', 'darkness', 'other', 'left', 'silliness']",The Amazing Spider-Man

The new Spider Man captures the true essence of the comic book, and delivers a story that could be taken from a comic book itself.Going forward i can't see another actor being used in the role of Spider Man, Andrew Garfield is the embodiment of Spider Man, and he definitely delivers a super hero performance.If you are a fan of the comic book, or of action super hero movies, this one is a must see.Blu-Ray Quality is Superb!",5,One of the best adaptations!,1390521600,"01 24, 2014",2014,969,"['movie', 'was', 'Amazing', 'Betther', 'first', 'three', 'humble', 'opinion', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'so', 'origin', 'story', 'being', 'told', 'more', 'once', 'Well', 'think', 'Marc', 'Webb', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'telling', 'story', 'once', 'again', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'go', 'depth', 'that', 'much', 'know', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'actions', 'sequences', 'were', 'amazing', 'better', 'previous', 'trilogy.By', 'far', 'best', 'Spider', 'Man', 'movie', 'ever', 'made', 'was', 'what', 'other', 'Spider', 'Man', 'was', 'missing', 'great', 'actors', 'gripping', 'story', 'tons', 'action', 'new', 'Spider', 'Man', 'true', 'essence', 'comic', 'book', 'story', 'could', 'be', 'taken', 'comic', 'book', 'itself.Going', 'forward', 'i', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'actor', 'being', 'used', 'role', 'Spider', 'Man', 'Andrew', 'Garfield', 'embodiment', 'Spider', 'Man', 'definitely', 'super', 'hero', 'performance.If', 'are', 'fan', 'comic', 'book', 'action', 'super', 'hero', 'movies', 'one', 'must', 'see.Blu-Ray', 'Quality', 'Superb']",The Amazing Spider-Man

Every time the actor playing a superhero changes, there needs to be a brand new movie rehashing the superhero's origins? More than a rehash, the origin has to be modified? I don't see the point, but it's okay with Marvel, and Marvel has the only vote that counts. Maybe in the next series of Spiderman movies, Peter Parker will be infected by nanobot spiders or bitten by a spider from Neptune. As long as people will pay to see the movie, Marvel will approve.Why not just take it as a given that we all know Spiderman's origin and do something to move the character forward instead of starting fresh? Particularly when the fresh start is as bland as this one. The story is mundane and too often cheesy. It felt like the writers needed to get this out of the way so they could move onto something more interesting. I hope they manage to cobble together a story worth filming before Andrew Garfield gets too old for the part (or too fat to fit into the tights).Since the story isn't worth telling (or retelling), the movie's only value lies in the action scenes. The early action sequences are filled with jump cuts. I know that's trendy, but in this case, it's also lazy. Continuous action creates a sense of realism but it's much harder to film. Stringing together bits and pieces of action and calling it ""edgy"" is a poor substitute for filming an action scene that looks like it's actually happening. Fortunately there was less of that as the movie went on, and mercifully little of the super-slow-mo that's also become unbearably trendy. In most other respects the special effects are entertaining -- as they should be in a superhero movie -- although the lizard villain looks like he was recycled from a bunch of other movies. A sequence involving a bunch of crane operators is difficult to believe (they all managed to get to their cranes and line them all up in a matter of minutes in the middle of the night?) but spectacular to watch -- by far the best part of the film. Let's hear it for the working man -- the movie's true hero.I don't know about the casting. Ridiculously good looking guys with perfect hair are not awkward around girls. At some points, Garfield plays the part like he's on an extended acid trip. Of course, if you were raised by Sally Fields, you'd be hallucinating too. At other points, Garfield plays the part like he's James Dean ... or James Dean on acid. I think Garfield gave it his best shot but he's just wrong for the part.I understand it may have been necessary to make a Spiderman move to avoid losing licensing rights, but that doesn't explain why anyone thought it was necessary to make THIS movie, covering well-trod ground.

For a story that better captures the origin story and Peter Parker's true personality, watch Sam Raimi's 2002Spider-Manstarring Tobey Maguire. The best thing about this film over that one are the performances (especially from Emma Stone who plays Gwen Stacy, and Rhys Ifans as Dr. Curt Connors/Lizard). That's about it. Stone shines as Stacy -- a vital part to the Spider-Man mythology who deserved better justice in Raimi's trilogy. BUT ... Parker's parents are hardly featured in the comic AND his father was not some scientist who helped develop the cross-species DNA splicing. In the comic, Parker's father was a Special Forces soldier working for Nick Fury. And while that's OK to alter that aspect, what's not OK is altering Peter Parker's entire personality, making him some brooding, artsy, skateboarder teenager. Also, it feels like the movie abruptly ends -- a problem that is difficult to fix. This adaptation is good for younger audiences and those who don't know the character or mythology well, or for those who haven't seen Raimi's movies (the second one being the only really good one).

1417524,A3LTZGHZBBBQX0,B004LWZWFQ,Anthony L.,"[5, 7]","WARNING: MINOR SPOILERS BELOW!!I liked The Amazing Spiderman. I really did.It's a good movie.But let's get three things out of the way:1. THE AMAZING SPIDERMAN IS NOT MORE ACCURATE TO THE COMICS THAN SAM RAIMI'S SUPERIOR SPIDER-MAN.The Amazing Spiderman is as UNFAITHFUL as a comic book movie can be to the source material. As shown in The Amazing Spider-Man #6 (1963), Dr. Curtis Connors was a heroic war veteran who's arm was injured in an explosion and had to be amputated.He became driven to invent a serum based on reptile DNA that would enable amputee's limbs to grow back. After much experimenting, he finally found the right serum and tested it on himself.For a while the serum worked, but it had a side effect: it turned Dr. Connors into a green-skinned, immensely powerful Reptilian-Humanoid monster. Dr. Connors slowly lost his human characteristics, and fled from his wife and son into the Florida Everglades.Peter Parker is sent by J. Jonah Jameson to get press coverage of the disappearance of the doctor.  Learning about his plight by the doctors wife and son, Peter uses his scientific expertise to concoct a serum that will turn The Lizard back into Curtis Connors. Spider-Man tracks the Lizard to his hideout in the Everglades, and the the two battle each other. In a scene now considered iconic, Spider-Man rams the serum down the Lizards throat as the two fall down a well.Stan Lee and Steve Ditko wrapped up a brilliant story on a positive note. Curtis Connors is restored to his human health, and Peter Parker gets paid for his troubles by Jolly Jonah Jameson.Some Inaccuracies:Dr. Curtis Connors was all American, not British (or Welsh, in the case of Rhys Ifans). He did not know Peter Parkers father, nor did he ever enter New York in the original storyline. He did not work at Oscorp.Peter Parker: See below.Gwen Stacy was not Peter Parker's first love interest. Mary Jane was.2. ANDREW GARFIELD IS NOT A BETTER SPIDER-MAN OR PETER PARKER THEN TOBEY MAGUIRE.There is a reason why Spider-Man is the greatest superhero ever written: because he is relatable. He suffers like we do; he is considered a nerd, he doesn't get the girl, he is beaten up at school, he is bullied, he has continual bad luck, he lives with his aunt. He isn't a billionaire playboy like Tony Stark or Bruce Wayne. He isn't an alien like Superman, or a Super-Soldier like Captain America.Peter Parker is an ordinary, powerless person who had greatness thrust upon him. He did not want that greatness. He did not deserve it. It was pure chance that the spider bit Peter and not Flash Thompson.It is that emotional side, that moving ordinariness that worked so well in Raimi's Spider-Man. The brilliant scene in Spider-Man 2 where Tobey Maguire's Peter Parker says to Uncle Ben, ""I'm Spider-Man...no more,"" and other scenes like it that elevate it to greatness.The Amazing Spiderman contains none of that.Andrew Garfield's Spider-Man is indeed dark. There is no reason why he shouldn't know a few forms of martial arts. He does not look like a geek, or talk like a geek.He gets the girl in the first hour of the film. If you recall Raimi's film, Spider-Man kisses Mary Jane while hanging upside down in a now iconic kissing scene. That is virtually all the kissing in the film. Even two films later their relationship is just beginning.That is what made us feel for Peter: the fact that he could beat up criminals and swing through the air, but he could not attend Mary Jane's concert.In the comics, there is an extremely powerful image of Betty Brant looking at a receding Peter Parker, who she had just rejected. Arms outspread, keeping them from being together, is an image of Spider-Man. Brilliant!In the Amazing Spider-Man Peter Parker not only gets the girl rather easily, but he reveals his secret identity to about a dozen people. That's not a bad thing, but I'm just pointing it out.3. THE AMAZING SPIDERMAN IS INFERIOR TO RAIMI'S SPIDER-MAN.The Amazing Spider-Man contains almost none of the earnestness, the emotion, the brightness, the classic action, and color of Sam Raimi's Spider-Man Trilogy. In trying to distance itself from it, they had to create something dark and somewhat messy. This is now known as ""The Christopher Nolan Treatment."" SeeThe Dark KnightThere are numerous plot holes: ""The Untold Story"" remains...untold! We still do not know what happened to Parker's parents, where they are, or where they went. What happened to Curt Connors, or who talked to him in the prison cell - was it Norman Osborn? How will Gwen Stacy's family survive without George Stacy, and how can Peter and Aunt May survive without Peter's job at the Daily Post? Why was a Doomsday machine sitting unguarded in the middle of an office?How did Curt Connors lose his arm? These and other questions remain unanswered.The most iconic line in Raimi's Spider-Man is ""With great power comes great responsibility."" This line has since passed into popular culture and is a brilliant representation of Peter's predicament - ""Some have greatness thrust upon them."" With The Amazing Spiderman, Sheen's Uncle Ben had to resort to saying something along the lines of: ""Your father used to say, if a man had great power it was his responsibility to use it.""I guess the good material was already taken....Sadly, The Amazing Spider-Man contains nothing of the style, atmosphere, character development, humor, or themes of the comics.4. PROS.But the Amazing Spiderman is not without its moments. Some are quite moving, in fact.On the comedic side, there is a memorable Stan Lee cameo, and there are several funny scenes with Peter Parker breaking everything in the house with his new ""power"".On the more serious side, there is a moving moment where Dr. Connors places his one arm in front of a mirror, giving the illusion that he has two arms. In my opinion it is a beautiful moment of longing and regret.By far best scene of the film occurs when a wounded, un-masked Peter Parker swings from crane to crane above a busy street, while the crane operators (who aligned their machines for him) look on in admiration, curiosity, or respect.It is a stunning, powerful scene, that equals if not rivals certain set pieces from Raimi's trilogy.Other good scenes include a talk between Martin Sheen's Uncle Ben and Peter Parker, where the uncle says ""Your father used to say, if a man had great power it was his responsibility to use it,"" and *SPOILER* Captain George Stacy's last stand against the Lizard. Come to think about it, the action scenes were all half-decent!...In conclusion, the Amazing Spiderman has plenty of flaws.But it is, indeed, amazing![...] Read my other reviews.

Meanwhile, Dr. Conors's own limb-regeneration experiments goes haywire and the good doctor is transformed into a giant lizard. Peter, now under the identity of Spider-Man, takes it upon himself to stop the Lizard at all costs before others get hurt.When I first heard they were rebooting Spider-Man, I was like, ""Come on, really? You just did that in the movies, the cartoons, in the comics . . ."" It seems Spider-Man has only one story to tell: his origin. They keep doing it, after all.But I got something more than that in The Amazing Spider-Man and I was won over. While I enjoyed the Raimi films on the whole, this one seemed more comic book Spider-Man to me as they dialed back the clock all the way to his childhood and got a bit more into Peter Parker's (Andrew Garfield's) parents' history, introduced Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone), and went with a villain that fans have been itching to see ever since his civilian identity was mentioned back in the 2002 Spider-Man movie: Dr. Conors aka the Lizard (Rhys Ifans). While Spidey's origin stayed true to its main components--getting bitten by a spider, Peter Parker as a student, the tragic death of Uncle Ben--they modernized it a bit and seemed to suggest that, kind of like in the 2003 Hulk movie, our hero's destiny was mapped out for him many years before. This part I wasn't too keen on, to be honest, nor was I big on how the Peter Parker side of things was done: pretty cool dude, likeable, good looking, hot girlfriend, etc. Pretty much the opposite of nerdy Parker becoming a superhero.However, on the Spider-Man side of things, we got one wicked webcrawler on our hands. We've got three movies prior to this one to learn how to make him move, swing around, climb walls, spin webs--everything that was showcased in this flick was like a comic book come to life. What made it work, too, was that it was believable and didn't look like a 3D cartoon unlike some sequences in 2002's Spider-Man. What made it even more special was that this Spider-Man actually cracked a lot of jokes, something that was missing for the most part from the other outings. And the Spider-Man-point-of-view wall crawling and swinging around scenes? Yes, please! Totally made you feel like you were there and reminded me a lot of the Spider-Man ride at Universal Studios in Florida. Bring back the mechanical webshooters instead of the organic variety (I didn't mind those, actually, as it makes more sense), and Spider-Man is back in business, baby!The stakes were high in this movie, too, with the Lizard being a serious bad guy to contend with. He was strong, powerful, showed no mercy, and that sewer scene was spooky.This movie was a lay-the-groundwork movie, setting things up for what is currently rumored to be three sequels and, according to director Marc Webb, aiming for the Sinister Six storyline, which was being mapped out even while they were making this Spider-Man movie. I can't wait. A giant Spider-Man story is going to be awesome and I'm glad they started from scratch to make it happen as they can then link everything together, starting from scene one.So what can I say? I've been pulled to the other side and am glad they rebooted Spider-Man. A part of me can't help but wonder what might've been had Spider-Man 4 happened, but this new journey we're on with our favorite webhead is off to a good start.",4,Solid Reboot with Big Things to Come,1384300800,"11 13, 2013",2013,3741,"['getting', 'bitten', 'genetically-modified', 'spider', 'teenager', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'spider-like', 'abilities', 'However', 'looking', 'past', 'Dr.', 'Conors', 'scientist', 'pupil', 'When', 'Peter', 'uncle', 'murdered', 'cold', 'blood', 'new', 'spider', 'abilities', 'try', 'track', 'down', 'killer', 'up', 'creating', 'alternate', 'identity', 'process', 'Meanwhile', 'Dr.', 'Conors', 'own', 'limb-regeneration', 'experiments', 'haywire', 'good', 'doctor', 'transformed', 'giant', 'lizard', 'Peter', 'now', 'identity', 'Spider-Man', 'stop', 'Lizard', 'costs', 'others', 'get', 'hurt.When', 'first', 'heard', 'were', 'rebooting', 'Spider-Man', 'was', 'Come', 'really', 'just', 'did', 'movies', 'cartoons', 'comics', 'Spider-Man', 'only', 'one', 'story', 'tell', 'origin', 'keep', 'doing', 'all.But', 'got', 'something', 'more', 'Amazing', 'Spider-Man', 'was', 'won', 'over', 'enjoyed', 'Raimi', 'films', 'whole', 'one', 'seemed', 'more', 'comic', 'book', 'Spider-Man', 'dialed', 'back', 'clock', 'way', 'childhood', 'got', 'bit', 'more', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'Andrew', 'Garfield', 'parents', 'history', 'introduced', 'Gwen', 'Stacy', 'Emma', 'Stone', 'went', 'villain', 'fans', 'have', 'been', 'itching', 'see', 'ever', 'civilian', 'identity', 'was', 'mentioned', 'back', '2002', 'Spider-Man', 'movie', 'Dr.', 'Conors', 'aka', 'Lizard', 'Rhys', 'Ifans', 'Spidey', 'origin', 'stayed', 'true', 'main', 'components', 'getting', 'bitten', 'spider', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'student', 'tragic', 'death', 'Uncle', 'Ben', 'modernized', 'bit', 'seemed', 'suggest', 'kind', 'like', '2003', 'Hulk', 'movie', 'hero', 'destiny', 'was', 'mapped', 'out', 'many', 'years', 'before', 'part', 'was', ""n't"", 'too', 'keen', 'be', 'honest', 'was', 'big', 'how', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'side', 'things', 'was', 'done', 'pretty', 'cool', 'dude', 'likeable', 'good', 'looking', 'hot', 'girlfriend', 'etc', 'Pretty', 'much', 'opposite', 'nerdy', 'Parker', 'becoming', 'superhero.However', 'Spider-Man', 'side', 'things', 'got', 'one', 'wicked', 'webcrawler', 'hands', ""'ve"", 'got', 'three', 'movies', 'prior', 'one', 'learn', 'how', 'make', 'move', 'swing', 'around', 'climb', 'walls', 'spin', 'webs', 'everything', 'was', 'showcased', 'flick', 'was', 'comic', 'book', 'come', 'life', 'What', 'made', 'work', 'too', 'was', 'was', 'believable', 'did', ""n't"", 'look', '3D', 'cartoon', 'sequences', '2002', 'Spider-Man', 'What', 'made', 'even', 'more', 'special', 'was', 'Spider-Man', 'actually', 'cracked', 'lot', 'jokes', 'something', 'was', 'missing', 'most', 'part', 'other', 'outings', 'Spider-Man-point-of-view', 'wall', 'crawling', 'swinging', 'scenes', 'Yes', 'please', 'Totally', 'made', 'feel', 'were', 'there', 'reminded', 'lot', 'Spider-Man', 'ride', 'Universal', 'Studios', 'Florida', 'Bring', 'back', 'mechanical', 'webshooters', 'instead', 'organic', 'variety', 'did', ""n't"", 'mind', 'actually', 'more', 'sense', 'Spider-Man', 'back', 'business', 'baby', 'stakes', 'were', 'high', 'movie', 'too', 'Lizard', 'being', 'serious', 'bad', 'guy', 'contend', 'was', 'strong', 'powerful', 'showed', 'mercy', 'sewer', 'scene', 'was', 'spooky.This', 'movie', 'was', 'lay-the-groundwork', 'movie', 'setting', 'things', 'up', 'what', 'currently', 'rumored', 'be', 'three', 'sequels', 'according', 'director', 'Marc', 'Webb', 'aiming', 'Sinister', 'Six', 'storyline', 'was', 'being', 'mapped', 'out', 'even', 'were', 'making', 'Spider-Man', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'giant', 'Spider-Man', 'story', 'going', 'be', 'awesome', ""'m"", 'glad', 'started', 'scratch', 'make', 'happen', 'can', 'then', 'link', 'everything', 'together', 'starting', 'scene', 'what', 'can', 'say', ""'ve"", 'been', 'pulled', 'other', 'side', 'am', 'glad', 'rebooted', 'Spider-Man', 'A', 'part', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'wonder', 'what', 'might', ""'ve"", 'been', 'had', 'Spider-Man', '4', 'happened', 'new', 'journey', ""'re"", 'favorite', 'webhead', 'good', 'start']",The Amazing Spider-Man

When his Uncle Ben gets killed, Peter takes up the mantle as Spider-Man and fight crime in the city. Spider-Man then meets up with Connors' alter-ego, The Lizard. It's then that Peter makes life-altering choices that take him down the path of his destiny to being a hero.I'm really impressed. The Amazing Spider Man is even better than I was really expecting it to be. Better than Raimi's Spider Man films, in some respects. Judging from all the reviews I read on the film when it first hit theaters and then reading the ones here at Amazon after it hit DVD & Blu-Ray, I was expecting this movie to be a huge disappointment and a real snoozefest. It ended up being anything but. I think people disliked this movie for the simple fact that Sam Raimi wasn't involved with it. I enjoyed this movie, dare I say it, alot more than the Avengers movie(and the Avengers was the top movie of the summer). It held my interest alot better, that's for sure.My only gripe with the movie didn't really have much to do with the movie, at all, really. It dealt with the design of Spider Man's outfit.  I know Webb was trying to create an outfit that looked like something a teenager could create but it was just horrendous looking. It reminded me of the costume from the old TV series of the same name from way back in the 70s(which I'd love to see released on DVD, btw). I hope that Webb, eventually, makes gradual changes in the design(as movies go on) to make it look like the Spidey we all know and love.For a reboot, this movie rocked!",5,The Amazing Spider Man........,1352851200,"11 14, 2012",2012,2156,"['When', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'briefcase', 'belonged', 'Father', 'quest', 'understand', 'parents', 'death', 'directly', 'Oscorp', 'lab', 'Dr.', 'Connors', 'who', 'father', 'former', 'partner', 'Sneaking', 'Oscorp', 'Peter', 'middle', 'Connors', 'experiments', 'getting', 'bitten', 'radioactive', 'genetically', 'modified', 'spider', 'ride', 'home', 'Peter', 'soon', 'out', 'bite', 'endowed', 'superhuman', 'abilities', 'such', 'strength', 'speed', 'ability', 'sense', 'oncoming', 'danger', 'ability', 'stick', 'surfaces', 'when', 'fight', 'subway', 'passenger', 'When', 'Uncle', 'Ben', 'killed', 'Peter', 'up', 'mantle', 'Spider-Man', 'fight', 'crime', 'city', 'Spider-Man', 'then', 'up', 'Connors', 'alter-ego', 'Lizard', 'then', 'Peter', 'life-altering', 'choices', 'take', 'down', 'path', 'destiny', 'being', 'hero.I', ""'m"", 'really', 'impressed', 'Amazing', 'Spider', 'Man', 'even', 'better', 'was', 'really', 'expecting', 'be', 'Better', 'Raimi', 'Spider', 'Man', 'films', 'respects', 'Judging', 'reviews', 'read', 'film', 'when', 'first', 'hit', 'theaters', 'then', 'reading', 'ones', 'here', 'Amazon', 'hit', 'DVD', 'Blu-Ray', 'was', 'expecting', 'movie', 'be', 'huge', 'disappointment', 'real', 'snoozefest', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'anything', 'think', 'people', 'disliked', 'movie', 'simple', 'fact', 'Sam', 'Raimi', 'was', ""n't"", 'involved', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'dare', 'say', 'more', 'Avengers', 'movie', 'Avengers', 'was', 'top', 'movie', 'summer', 'held', 'interest', 'alot', 'better', 'sure.My', 'only', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'have', 'much', 'do', 'movie', 'really', 'design', 'Spider', 'Man', 'outfit', 'know', 'Webb', 'was', 'trying', 'create', 'outfit', 'looked', 'something', 'teenager', 'could', 'create', 'was', 'just', 'horrendous', 'looking', 'reminded', 'costume', 'old', 'TV', 'series', 'same', 'name', 'way', 'back', '70s', ""'d"", 'love', 'see', 'released', 'DVD', 'btw', 'hope', 'Webb', 'eventually', 'gradual', 'changes', 'design', 'movies', 'go', 'make', 'look', 'Spidey', 'know', 'love.For', 'reboot', 'movie', 'rocked']",The Amazing Spider-Man

1417546,A1ZWDTXSH1ZV8E,B004LWZWFQ,B. Martin,"[1, 3]","Five years after Sam Rami concluded his Spider-Man trilogy with the financially lucrative but critically panned Spider-Man 3, Sony has rebooted the franchise with a new creative team and cast.  Marc Webb (500 Days of Summer) directs and Andrew Garfield (The Social Network) heads up the cast as the new web slinger. So how does the new package hold up?  In a word, meh.  I will admit that I am a big fan of Rami's trilogy, but I was certainly interested in seeing what new direction this reboot would go.  This Spider-Man is darker and moodier, perhaps taking a cue from Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy.  Garfield portrays Peter Parker as a hipster of sorts who rides a skateboard, dabbles in photography and is extremely intelligent but also slightly lazy and cynical.  All of this seems in stark contrast to the character made famous by Stan Lee and a complete 180 from Tobey Maguire's portrayal.  While this is an intersting spin to put on the character, it just didn't ring true to me and I felt very disconnected from the film as a result.Marc Webb's direction is solid, but he really doesn't put his signature on the film.  He seems a bit too concerned with making sure that the film meets the expectations of audiences instead of truly throwing himself into the storytelling process in an exciting way.  The supporting cast is solid, but nobody apart from Dennis Leary as the father of Peter's love interest makes much of a lasting imprression.  The plot of the film focuses on Spidey's origins but it takes a long  time getting there and leaves little time for his showdown with The Lizard, a villian who harkens back to the very early days of the comic books.Perhaps Webb and company are merely setting things up for more compelling and entertaining installments yet to come.  That is my hope becase The Amazing Spider-Man lacks both of these qualities.  It is basically a reintroduction to the beloved icon that doesn't feel new or fresh.

For me the Keaton/Nicholson version is a classic, mostly due to Nicholson's Joker. But this Spiderman by far surpassed the previous three with Toby McGuire, which were great. This one had the perfect amount of action for any superhero fan. The choreography was the best of any movie I have seen in decades. I own over 1100 dvds. The romance, action, drama, action, plot line, the action, was perfect. The chemistry between the two real life lovers, Andrew Garfield(Peter Parker/Spiderman) and Emma Stone(Gwen Stacey) was palpable. I have nothing negative to say about this film. Sally Field, as usual did a perfect job as Aunt May.  Martin Sheen, a great actor, was great as Uncle Ben. Adding the storyline about Peter's parents were an added bonus, as the comics don't delve into it much. Peter's releasing frustration at Uncle Ben about the pain of his parents deserting him, was heart touching, heart felt and well acted. I had never heard of Garfield before this movie. We all will know him henceforth. He is a damn good actor. Can't wait for the next installment. Garfeild is clearly then next big star. This is his breakout movie and he broke out just fine. Emma Stone is the next great character actress, as opposed to being typecast.Great enemy with special effects(The Lizard). Good acting by the actor who played Kurt Connors. Great movie. Great cast.

It almost felt like a tribute to the Simpsons' episode where Bart loses his radio down the well. The one that says ""Property of Bart Simpson"". Except, Bart isn't a genius. Peter Parker, supposedly is. That's a convenient plot hole. The film fails to explain why he's even labeled his own camera equipment. Mind you, he has yet to work for the Daily Bulge in the film.Captain Stacy's dying wish is that Peter won't involve Gwen in his crime-fighting because it'll endanger her life. But, at the last scene of the film, Gwen gives Peter the silent treatment, and Peter basically hints at that this promise is as good as a politician's promise. So-- it's like, go screw yourself, Dennis Leary. I'm going to continue nailing your daughter right after class is over.Spider-Man gets nailed by a bullet from the police and, as a result, is in such physical agony, pain, and limping about that he's unable to even properly scale a building. Err... where's the spider strength? The problem is that Spider-Man in this film is reduced from super hero to super human. A single bullet from a policeman's rifle is able to almost cripple thy superhero? WTF.Note to self: Use 2 bullets to defeat Spider-Man.Spider-Man's battle with the Lizard. It's almost comical in that it isn't by intelligence or his sheer strength that he defeats the Lizard. It's by a fortunate appearance by Captain Stacy (and his unfortunate death) that distracts the Lizard and buys Spidey enough time to insert the antidote into the dispersal device. Again-- another instance of Spider-Man being reduced to a mere super human.Peter Parker is kind of an idiot. The multiple, multiple times he reveals himself. Hey! Lemme take off my mask and reveal my identity, random kid. Hey, Gwen. You're hot. Lemme show you my web-slinger so I can make out with you. Hey, Captain Stacy, this handcuffs will surely hold me--or not. Because I have superhuman strength and can easily break through these handcuffs but would rather you ambush me first and make things exciting.Throw in ""The Dark Knight Returns"" epic storyline where the police are launching a manhunt after Spider-Man because he's a vigilante and not putting forth more manpower towards the actual threat to the city. Yeah-- this isn't quite like Batman. Spider-Man is just nailing the Police Commissioner's daughter, unlike Batman who threatened the lives of the Police Commissioner's children and allegedly killed the District Attorney.CGIThe computer graphics in this film are terribly fake and cheap when compared to other Marvel Studios' films: ""Iron Man 2"" and ""The Avengers"".

1417565,A2983KT3N8FGM0,B004LWZWFQ,Calder,"[3, 4]","Considering this film both as a standalone and in comparison to the previous series, the discerning viewer will likely keep asking the same question many others disappointed by it are asking - why? The entire production screamed mediocre, despite another sprawling budget. I kept trying to consider performances both on their own and inevitably in comparison to the other films - since, after all, they were just released a few years ago. I felt virtually every actor and actress lead in the first film was stronger. I love much of Sally Field's work, but she felt completely miscast in this movie. Andrew Garfield was fine as Spiderman, but in my opinion not nearly as engaging or interesting as Tobey Maguire. Martin Sheen is hard to beat, but frankly I would probably still argue Uncle Ben was better played by Cliff Robertson.The storyline itself (and its minor changes) felt thrown together. I thought numerous aspects of this film felt like they were designed to directly compete with the previous series - which also undermines uncritical fans who keep claiming comparisons aren't fair. In my opinion this film often felt like it was trying to compete with the earlier series. For example. . .(Minor spoilers ahead)Before the closing credits there are extended scenes of Spiderman web slinging around the city, moving between buildings, etc. We saw this sort of thing in the previous series . . .however in this one the tricks and stunts he performs are pushed to the extreme and just looked, in my opinion, ridiculous. . .and the CGI doesn't keep up. Those scenes and some of the fighting have that ""speeded up"" CGI look - I suspect you know what I mean. Think back to Spiderman 3 - I felt it suffered from it as well. Too much is going on and it starts to look like old 1950s stop motion. Some of the fight scenes just did not look convincing. Compare this film's CGI to the climatic scenes in ""The Avengers"" - the quality is, in my opinion, very different.I was also left a little perplexed as to why the Lizard was chosen as the main villain. Granted, they were trying to do a few things differently (far too few, in my opinion), but the Lizard? I do not read comic books anymore, but I do not recall the Lizard being a key villain while I was growing up. . .even the Beetle might have been a better choice. That's just a personal opinion - I think the larger issue was the manner in which the character was developed in the script. Rhys Ifans does what he can with the material and he is clearly a competent actor, but I found little interesting about the overall portrayal of the villain of this film. I was never quite sure I understood why he was executing his dastardly plan, and frankly didn't care. This movie eventually just lost me..I watch a lot of movies, but I have zero loyalty to the first Spiderman series. I evaluated this film first on its own merits, and then in comparison to the other films - which are both inevitable things to do. If the previous films had never been made, this film would still feel like a very weak link in what has been a surprisingly good 2012 summer movie season. There was little that was ""amazing"" - though overall it isn't terrible. . .ultimately it just felt like a pure Hollywood money grab. It reminds me of some of Roland Emmerich's films, which I always wanted to love but ultimately felt a bit betrayed by. Granted, every mainstream film is ultimately about making money, but are the highest paid writers in Hollywood this incapable of either originality or improvement? Jeez the Marvel, DC and assorted other comic universes are huge. Please, at least pick something original to the screen and write a script worth watching.",2,"Ok as a standalone diversion, but unnecessary, inferior and one of the weakest superhero films of late",1341705600,"07 8, 2012",2012,3689,"['Considering', 'film', 'standalone', 'comparison', 'previous', 'series', 'discerning', 'viewer', 'will', 'likely', 'keep', 'asking', 'same', 'question', 'many', 'others', 'disappointed', 'are', 'asking', 'why', 'entire', 'production', 'screamed', 'mediocre', 'sprawling', 'budget', 'kept', 'trying', 'consider', 'performances', 'own', 'inevitably', 'comparison', 'other', 'films', 'were', 'just', 'released', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'felt', 'virtually', 'actor', 'actress', 'lead', 'first', 'film', 'was', 'stronger', 'love', 'much', 'Sally', 'Field', 'work', 'felt', 'completely', 'miscast', 'movie', 'Andrew', 'Garfield', 'was', 'fine', 'Spiderman', 'opinion', 'not', 'nearly', 'engaging', 'interesting', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'Martin', 'Sheen', 'hard', 'beat', 'frankly', 'would', 'probably', 'still', 'argue', 'Uncle', 'Ben', 'was', 'better', 'played', 'Cliff', 'Robertson.The', 'storyline', 'minor', 'changes', 'felt', 'thrown', 'together', 'thought', 'numerous', 'aspects', 'film', 'felt', 'were', 'designed', 'directly', 'compete', 'previous', 'series', 'also', 'uncritical', 'fans', 'who', 'keep', 'claiming', 'comparisons', 'are', ""n't"", 'fair', 'opinion', 'film', 'often', 'felt', 'was', 'trying', 'compete', 'earlier', 'series', 'example', 'Minor', 'spoilers', 'ahead', 'closing', 'credits', 'are', 'extended', 'scenes', 'Spiderman', 'web', 'slinging', 'city', 'moving', 'buildings', 'etc', 'saw', 'sort', 'thing', 'previous', 'series', '.however', 'one', 'tricks', 'stunts', 'are', 'pushed', 'extreme', 'just', 'looked', 'opinion', 'ridiculous', '.and', 'CGI', ""n't"", 'keep', 'up', 'scenes', 'fighting', 'have', 'speeded', 'up', 'CGI', 'look', 'suspect', 'know', 'what', 'mean', 'Think', 'back', 'Spiderman', '3', 'felt', 'suffered', 'as', 'well', 'Too', 'much', 'going', 'look', 'old', '1950s', 'stop', 'motion', 'fight', 'scenes', 'just', 'did', 'not', 'look', 'convincing', 'Compare', 'film', 'CGI', 'climatic', 'scenes', 'Avengers', 'quality', 'opinion', 'very', 'different.I', 'was', 'also', 'left', 'little', 'perplexed', 'why', 'Lizard', 'was', 'chosen', 'main', 'villain', 'Granted', 'were', 'trying', 'do', 'few', 'things', 'differently', 'far', 'too', 'few', 'opinion', 'Lizard', 'do', 'not', 'read', 'comic', 'books', 'anymore', 'do', 'not', 'recall', 'Lizard', 'being', 'key', 'villain', 'was', 'growing', 'up', '.even', 'Beetle', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'choice', 'just', 'personal', 'opinion', 'think', 'larger', 'issue', 'was', 'manner', 'character', 'was', 'developed', 'script', 'Rhys', 'Ifans', 'what', 'can', 'material', 'clearly', 'competent', 'actor', 'found', 'little', 'interesting', 'overall', 'portrayal', 'villain', 'film', 'was', 'never', 'quite', 'sure', 'understood', 'why', 'was', 'executing', 'dastardly', 'plan', 'frankly', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'movie', 'eventually', 'just', 'lost', 'me..I', 'watch', 'lot', 'movies', 'have', 'zero', 'loyalty', 'first', 'Spiderman', 'series', 'evaluated', 'film', 'first', 'own', 'merits', 'then', 'comparison', 'other', 'films', 'are', 'inevitable', 'things', 'do', 'previous', 'films', 'had', 'never', 'been', 'made', 'film', 'would', 'still', 'feel', 'very', 'weak', 'link', 'what', 'been', 'surprisingly', 'good', '2012', 'summer', 'movie', 'season', 'was', 'little', 'was', 'amazing', 'overall', ""n't"", 'terrible', '.ultimately', 'just', 'felt', 'pure', 'Hollywood', 'money', 'grab', 'Roland', 'Emmerich', 'films', 'always', 'wanted', 'love', 'ultimately', 'felt', 'bit', 'betrayed', 'Granted', 'mainstream', 'film', 'ultimately', 'making', 'money', 'are', 'highest', 'paid', 'writers', 'Hollywood', 'incapable', 'originality', 'improvement', 'Jeez', 'Marvel', 'DC', 'assorted', 'other', 'comic', 'universes', 'are', 'huge', 'Please', 'least', 'pick', 'something', 'original', 'screen', 'write', 'script', 'worth', 'watching']",The Amazing Spider-Man
1417566,A1PJZKEZQGREDY,B004LWZWFQ,California Dreaming,"[2, 3]","I've always been hesitant about remakes, or even reboots.  If you think about it logically, no one ever seems to want to remake a bad film; everyone always wants to remake a good film.  And when you remake a good film, there will be natural comparisons:  ""Is the new one as good?  Is the new one worse?  Why even remake this thing?"" might be a few good questions you might ask.But I do think it's not a bad idea to remake a film if there was something seriously wrong with the original -- the acting was terrible or the direction was terrible, for example -- but that doesn't seem to be the case with the ""original"" Spiderman franchise with Toby Maguire.  And while special effects surely have improved over the last few years or so, they haven't improved enough to justify this reboot.""So why then?"" you may ask, and the reason is obvious:  it is a moneymaker.  The film itself wouldn't have to be all that good to make a buck or two (or a 100 million or two), and this is exactly what happened.  While it probably made a lot of money, ""The Amazing Spiderman"" proves that spiders have no soul.  And neither does this film.But what is even worse about this whole endeavor:  I got thinking while watching -- you'll have plenty of time to think since this misfire won't really tax your brain in any way -- and I came to the conclusion that ""Spiderman"" or ""Superman"" or ""X-Man,"" you name it, doesn't really fit into the framework of American political correctness nowadays.  I give away no spoiler when I write that you've got the trophy-girlfriend-who-needs-to-be-saved chick, and you've got the bullied-kid-but-now-he's-the-tough-guy superhero saving her.  But do you ever see this dynamic in commercials in the 21st century?  Heck no!  What you see is some girl who's been training to fight and kick tail, and SHE saves the guy!  Yeah!  Everybody wins; the guy doesn't get his tail kicked and the girl gets to show how empowered women have become.  Not so here in Spiderman.Of course, I'm being a little snarky about the change in sexual dynamics, but I'm still not far from the truth.  And what is even a ""bigger"" truth, if ""truth"" can and may be a relative term:  there was no reason to remake this film.

What Raimi did was immense but after three movies it was high time to inject some sort of fresh tone & vision, & ultimately bring something further to the table on a new film. I don't think it was too soon at all to do something new with a Spider-Man movie. Despite this being an origin story I can't help but feel that if anything, ASM more than makes up for Raimi's Spider-Man 3 catastrophe because in Webb's interpretation we've got a much more cerebral story with less emphasis on ""popcorn flick"" not with standing the slick & spectacular live action & special effects. Also to all the naysayers; The Lizard's look effectively resembles his very first appearance as illustrated by Steve Ditko & successfully fusions the various versions of this classic villains 49 year history. Andrew Garfield does a great job portraying a very different & introspective Peter Parker. Director Marc Webb really put's Parker through the ringer in this one. Mentally & physically. In total, Marc Webb's movie knocks down the original Spider-Man film aesthetically plus it's a bit more brooding too recalling influences begun in a film like Daredevil but translated successfully in a powerhouse like Batman Begins.

1417591,A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ,B004LWZWFQ,Chris Kennison,"[4, 10]","""The Amazing Spiderman"" has come to theatres with a promise of a restart to the old ""Spiderman"" series that ended in 2007 with Tobey Maguire and Sam Raimi. The first ""Spiderman"" movie launched in 2002 with exciting technology, cool effects and grossed $821 million. In fact, even the third of the series made $890 million, despite being an absolute mess of a movie and the death of the series. So, ""The Amazing Spiderman"" reboot 2012, is most likely going to be another great addition to an otherwise outstanding summer of movies.There is much to be said about ""The Amazing Spiderman"" and for the most part, all of it is good. One of my first inclinations when I saw that the new movie was `restarting' with Peter Parker, a.k.a. Spiderman's origins and back story, I thought, haven't we already seen this. Do we have to start over from scratch? In a way, we did. The new movie has more insight and a different story to tell, but at the same time, it rehashes a lot of the same things the 2002 ""Spiderman"" tackled.On the down side, this restarting put us right into the same place we were with Batman when it was rebooted with ""Dark Knight"" and when ""Iron Man"" began. First you must endure an hour of Peter Parker becoming Spiderman and then things can get to what you came to see. That being said, the hour of `becoming' Spiderman was not unbearable thanks to great actors, up and coming actors and a reliance of the director to make sure that we not only recognized the characters, but we knew them, loved them and cared about them. This might just be the biggest gift of the movie. I can safely say, that the characters in ""The Amazing Spiderman"" were brought to life more vividly than the previous serious.Like ""Dark Knight"" and ""Iron Man"", ""The Amazing Spiderman"" builds to a crescendo of effects, action and intensity. It also builds to a point that you know by the time it's over that, like ""Dark Knight"" and we hoped ""Iron Man"", the second movie from the creators of ""The Amazing Spiderman"" is going to be absolutely breathtaking. With time, comes knowledge, lessons learned and the biggest point of all, better technology.When Spiderman is being Spiderman, the technology that a new age of 3D and special effects has allowed filmmakers to do things that was previously only possible in cartoons. Unfortunately, it takes a long time to get to the full fledged Spiderman moments. The moments at the end of the movie, basically show you what's in store when ""The Amazing Spiderman 2"" comes out and we can skip all the `how it became to be' stuff.We've seen a lot of it before, but that doesn't stop the movie from being well acted, emotional and dazzling. For the most part though, at least all the formality is out of the way now, and when they decide to film movie number two, it won't be so bogged down with explanation.

A young Peter Parker discovers his father Richard Parker's study has been burglarized.  Gathering up hidden documents, Peter's parents take him to the home of his Aunt May and Uncle Ben, then mysteriously depart.

Turns out, they improved the franchise. There's a clunky awkwardness between Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone that seems more like real chemistry than what we've seen in previous Spiderman films. (I don't think you can talk about this movie without referencing the Toby Maguire films -- it's just so soon.) Garfield's Spiderman is a little less articulate, less snarky, less &#34;your friendly neighborhood&#34; Spiderman than we've seen in the past, but he does make the &#34;kid&#34; part of the character a little more believable. The supporting cast is good, too, particularly Martin Sheen as a working-man's Uncle Ben (No, not the rice guy.).  Funny, though, I find it easier to believe that a kid can get turned into a super-hero by a spider bite than I can believe that a New York cop, even a captain, lives the way Dennis Leary's family does -- their dinner scene is  just short of a butler from complete. Small irritation, explainable by family money, I guess, but weird nonetheless.

1417609,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B004LWZWFQ,C. Sawin,"[4, 11]","You should probably know ahead of time that Spider-Man's origin has been altered in the film. Several things have been switched around including how Peter Parker becomes Spider-Man, his parents, Uncle Ben, and Gwen Stacy. The interesting part is that it kind of feels necessary for a film like this. Telling the exact same story again would be completely redundant. They've kept the big events the same, but altered the little ones. It's like taking a different path you haven't taken before to reach the same destination.As soon as the film begins, you can already feel the chemistry between Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone. They say so little at first, but their body language, facial expressions, and that never ending gleam in their eyes lets you know way ahead of time that the spark between them is already starting to grow. ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" is very much a human story meaning the characters and the story take a front seat. There's still a ton of action, but it's really only to help progress an already engrossing story.Andrew Garfield is particularly spectacular in the role of Peter Parker. He's completely different in comparison to Tobey Maguire; both in appearance and performance. Garfield is more slender and taller than Maguire. This version of Spider-Man seems to actually embrace the smart mouth aspect of the character in ""The Amazing Spider-Man."" The car thief with the knife scene is the best example. It also seems like Garfield's Peter Parker goes through a hell of a lot more in one movie than Tobey Maguire did. It feels more emotional and more tragic. You don't even see anything remotely resembling the Spider-Man suit for nearly an hour.The special effects are pretty astounding, as well. Oscorp's technology is as impressive as Tony Stark's is in the ""Iron Man"" movies. The Lizard looks pretty fantastic for being mostly CG. Rhys Ifans does a phenomenal job as Dr. Curt Connors. He has this sequence in the sewer after he's already transformed a few times where he's arguing with himself that is really impressive.The 3D is also the best to come along in quite some time. It mostly comes into play when Spider-Man is web slinging through the city (as his feet or webbing jump out at you) and during credit sequences, but there's also an endless amount of debris that flies into the camera. The first person Spider-Man sequences may visually be the best thing about the movie. All those little kids who have dreamt of being Spider-Man now have a visual aid to back it up.The superhero blockbuster packs a lot of brains into its 136-minute runtime. The amount of science crammed into the film including the cross species genetics stuff is very interesting. But the way Peter incorporates natural spider-like qualities into his abilities is also really cool; Garfield certainly deserves a lot of credit for that. When Spider-Man is trying to find The Lizard, he makes a spider web in the sewer and waits for something to come to him.Does it bother anyone else the way Peter Parker seems to throw his secret identity around like it's nothing? Maybe it's because the comics played up the importance of it so much and Peter wasn't taking off his mask in public six times in the span of two hours, but it just feels like everybody knows who he is by the time the movie ends.""The Amazing Spider-Man"" is pretty extraordinary for a reboot of a beloved franchise. In fact, it's better than it really has any right to be. The 3D isn't a complete waste, the special effects are fantastic, the action sequences are extremely impressive, and the entire cast keeps your eyes glued to the screen. The battles between Spider-Man and The Lizard are pretty breathtaking.But is it better than the original trilogy? It's difficult to say. This is like discovering a new formula to reach a similar result. ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" is slightly darker in tone and less campy than the ""Spider-Man"" films. Visually incredible, intimate, emotional, and intelligent; ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" is a sensational entry in the superhero genre that lives up to the Spider-Man name.",5,"Intelligent, emotional, and spectacular",1341014400,"06 30, 2012",2012,4082,"['should', 'probably', 'know', 'ahead', 'time', 'Spider-Man', 'origin', 'been', 'altered', 'film', 'Several', 'things', 'have', 'been', 'switched', 'including', 'how', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'Spider-Man', 'parents', 'Uncle', 'Ben', 'Gwen', 'Stacy', 'interesting', 'part', 'kind', 'feels', 'necessary', 'film', 'Telling', 'exact', 'same', 'story', 'again', 'would', 'be', 'completely', 'redundant', ""'ve"", 'kept', 'big', 'events', 'same', 'altered', 'little', 'ones', 'taking', 'different', 'path', 'have', ""n't"", 'taken', 'before', 'reach', 'same', 'destination.As', 'soon', 'film', 'can', 'already', 'feel', 'chemistry', 'Andrew', 'Garfield', 'Emma', 'Stone', 'say', 'so', 'little', 'first', 'body', 'language', 'facial', 'expressions', 'never', 'ending', 'gleam', 'eyes', 'know', 'way', 'ahead', 'time', 'spark', 'already', 'starting', 'grow', 'Amazing', 'Spider-Man', 'very', 'much', 'human', 'story', 'meaning', 'characters', 'story', 'take', 'front', 'seat', 'still', 'ton', 'action', 'really', 'only', 'help', 'progress', 'already', 'engrossing', 'story.Andrew', 'Garfield', 'particularly', 'spectacular', 'role', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'completely', 'different', 'comparison', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'appearance', 'performance', 'Garfield', 'more', 'slender', 'taller', 'Maguire', 'version', 'Spider-Man', 'actually', 'embrace', 'smart', 'mouth', 'aspect', 'character', 'Amazing', 'Spider-Man', 'car', 'thief', 'knife', 'scene', 'best', 'example', 'also', 'Garfield', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'hell', 'lot', 'more', 'one', 'movie', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'did', 'more', 'emotional', 'more', 'tragic', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'see', 'anything', 'remotely', 'resembling', 'Spider-Man', 'suit', 'nearly', 'hour.The', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'pretty', 'astounding', 'as', 'well', 'Oscorp', 'technology', 'as', 'impressive', 'Tony', 'Stark', 'Iron', 'Man', 'movies', 'Lizard', 'pretty', 'fantastic', 'being', 'mostly', 'CG', 'Rhys', 'Ifans', 'phenomenal', 'job', 'Dr.', 'Curt', 'Connors', 'sequence', 'sewer', 'already', 'transformed', 'few', 'times', 'where', 'arguing', 'really', 'impressive.The', '3D', 'also', 'best', 'come', 'along', 'quite', 'time', 'mostly', 'play', 'when', 'Spider-Man', 'web', 'slinging', 'city', 'feet', 'webbing', 'jump', 'out', 'credit', 'sequences', 'also', 'endless', 'amount', 'debris', 'camera', 'first', 'person', 'Spider-Man', 'sequences', 'may', 'visually', 'be', 'best', 'thing', 'movie', 'little', 'kids', 'who', 'have', 'dreamt', 'being', 'Spider-Man', 'now', 'have', 'visual', 'aid', 'back', 'up.The', 'superhero', 'blockbuster', 'lot', 'brains', '136-minute', 'runtime', 'amount', 'science', 'crammed', 'film', 'including', 'cross', 'genetics', 'stuff', 'very', 'interesting', 'way', 'Peter', 'natural', 'spider-like', 'qualities', 'abilities', 'also', 'really', 'cool', 'Garfield', 'certainly', 'lot', 'credit', 'When', 'Spider-Man', 'trying', 'find', 'Lizard', 'spider', 'web', 'sewer', 'waits', 'something', 'come', 'him.Does', 'bother', 'anyone', 'else', 'way', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'throw', 'secret', 'identity', 'nothing', 'Maybe', 'comics', 'played', 'up', 'importance', 'so', 'much', 'Peter', 'was', ""n't"", 'taking', 'off', 'mask', 'public', 'six', 'times', 'span', 'two', 'hours', 'just', 'feels', 'everybody', 'knows', 'who', 'time', 'movie', 'Amazing', 'Spider-Man', 'pretty', 'extraordinary', 'reboot', 'beloved', 'franchise', 'fact', 'better', 'really', 'right', 'be', '3D', ""n't"", 'complete', 'waste', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'fantastic', 'action', 'sequences', 'are', 'extremely', 'impressive', 'entire', 'cast', 'eyes', 'glued', 'screen', 'battles', 'Spider-Man', 'Lizard', 'are', 'pretty', 'breathtaking.But', 'better', 'original', 'trilogy', 'difficult', 'say', 'discovering', 'new', 'formula', 'reach', 'similar', 'result', 'Amazing', 'Spider-Man', 'slightly', 'darker', 'tone', 'less', 'campy', 'Spider-Man', 'films', 'Visually', 'incredible', 'intimate', 'emotional', 'intelligent', 'Amazing', 'Spider-Man', 'sensational', 'entry', 'superhero', 'genre', 'up', 'Spider-Man', 'name']",The Amazing Spider-Man

Tsao ""Seaview1""","[2, 6]","For the past decade, Marvel Comics has been churning out film versions of its iconic super heroes, but in this case, Spiderman, only a decade before, had been rendered successfully by director Sam Raimi.  Well, a poor third film meant a reimagining of the franchise, and as The Hulk and Batman series have shown, studios are willing to try to reclaim a tentpole blockbuster.  The risk can be a marginal failure as in Superman Returns. Not so here. With well cast leads and strong supporting roles, The Amazing Spider-Man is quite entertaining especially toward the end, and it displays emotional resonance that enhances its storyline.Young Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) lives with his Aunt May (Sally Field) and Uncle Ben (Martin Sheen) after his parents abandoned him as a child.  Now an awkward, bullied high school student, he has a crush on cute blonde, Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone), who has an authoritarian father (Denis Leary).  Upon discovering his dad's old files, Peter seeks out his father's former colleague, Dr. Curt Connors (Rhys Ifans), who is researching the regenerative, healing capabilities of reptiles in his lab at Oscorp.  Parker snoops around the lab and gets bitten by a genetically enhanced spider, and soon he begins to develop superhuman strength, agility, reflexes, and the ability to crawl on walls as well as shoot a powerful web.  His self absorption sets in motion events that will exact personal loss.  Guilt stricken, he becomes a masked avenger, catching criminals much to the chagrin of the police who think he is a vigilante.  Meanwhile, a desperate Connors is forced to test a serum on himself which transforms him into the Lizard who menaces the city streets and threatens to infect the entire population with the chemical. As Spiderman confronts The Lizard in a grand battle, the fate of the city including Gwen hangs in the balance.How does this compare to the previous Spiderman?  It's nearly as good but with a different take and still retains the essential ingredients that made the former film a standout.  The film always keeps the focus on the relationships between Peter and Gwen and Peter and his family.  Those grounded bonds form the soul of the film and make the film a more enriching experience.  There is no Mary Jane Watson or J. Jonah Jameson yet.The filmmakers, director Marc Webb (500 Days of Summer) and screenwriters James Vanderbilt (Zodiac), Alvin Sargent (Ordinary People), and Steve Kloves (Harry Potter series) made the smart choice of starting with a younger version of Peter Parker, perfectly embodied by Garfield, whose adolescence and psychology are part of a fully realized character.  Garfield and Stone make an adorable couple and display good chemistry that is endearing.  Fields and Sheen are quite effective as Peter's guardians and the screen lights up whenever they appear.  Leary, proving he can do drama as well as comedy, makes the most of his role as Stacy's dad who is a police captain in conflict over the rogue Spiderman.  Marvel legend Stan ""the Man"" Lee has another amusing cameo.Although bereft with open ended plot points by film's end (likely to be resolved in future sequels), there are a couple of nice touches that lift this film above most standard comic book adaptations.  In one particularly affecting scene, a construction worker rallies a team of crane operators to assist Spiderman, whose earlier courageous act now pays timely dividends.  During the rousing climax, Spiderman is rescued when an unlikely savior intercedes.  Even Connors' Lizard is not your stereotypic villain and figures in a surprising and unexpected act at film's end.Special effects were pretty good in the older Spiderman, but they are even better here especially in the trademark web swinging between skyscrapers. If the musical score sounds like a cross between A Beautiful Mind and Aliens, it's because James Horner does the honors on each film.Despite the odds, what is `amazing' is that lightning has struck twice for the franchise. The Amazing Spider-Man is a familiar yet refreshing take on a formula that works quite well here.

Teenage Peter Parker gets bitten by a radioactive spider.  Hijinks ensue.  THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN is another (too soon) attempt to reboot the legend, this time with Andrew Garfield (THE SOCIAL NETWORK) slipping into the suit.  He's still an outcast (the idea that Garfield, who radiates cool, wouldn't be popular is just laughable), and still infatuated with a girl a little beyond his means (Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy).  As Parker gets used to his new powers and abilities, he's pursued by Gwen's father (Dennis Leary), who just happens to be a cop.  Oh, and there's something about a former coworker of Peter's father, who accidentally transforms himself into a murderous lizard and goes on random killing sprees that have little point to them, but certainly look great.Sense my skepticism?  There's a lot to dislike here.  Garfield is a superb actor, he's proven that before, and he's good here; the problem is, he's not Peter Parker.  The character HAS been updated a bit (he's not the total geek that Tobey Maguire's portrayal was, for example), but just not enough.  Garfield and Stone (real life sweeties) have great screen chemistry, and Leary brings a nice edge, like always.  As the doctor/lizard, Rhys Ifans is solid, though like Alfred Molina in Raimi's second film, he just doesn't have much to do (the Lizard and Doc Oc, at least on-screen, share a lot of similarities, one of which is fantastic actors cast in promising roles, but then chained down by script issues).  Also enjoyable are Martin Sheen and Sally Field as Uncle Ben and Aunt May; and look for a (per usual) hilarious cameo from Spidey creator Stan Lee.The script has so many holes that the characters are bound to trip up.  The subplot about Peter's father (arguably more interesting than anything else here) is basically forgotten (don't worry, it'll show up in the sequel, the film's ending makes sure of that); and the Lizard goes on several rampages, chasing after Spidey when he could just as easily be going about his plot of bringing New York to its knees.  Marc Webb's direction is solid, though, and the film looks--and more importantly, feels--amazing.  I'm harping on it simply because, while there's a lot to dislike, there's also a lot to love.  It could have been much better.  Still.  Fanboys should be pleased, and if you like a good superhero popcorn flick, THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN delivers in spades.",4,A solid superhero film,1352332800,"11 8, 2012",2012,2573,"['do', ""n't"", 'know', 'story', 'Spider-man', 'then', 'missed', 'first', 'three', 'Sam', 'Raimi', 'films', '90', 'television', 'show', 'countless', 'other', 'adaptations', 'classic', 'comic', 'book', 'Teenage', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'bitten', 'radioactive', 'spider', 'Hijinks', 'ensue', 'AMAZING', 'SPIDER-MAN', 'too', 'soon', 'attempt', 'reboot', 'legend', 'time', 'Andrew', 'Garfield', 'THE', 'SOCIAL', 'NETWORK', 'slipping', 'suit', 'still', 'outcast', 'idea', 'Garfield', 'who', 'cool', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'popular', 'just', 'laughable', 'still', 'infatuated', 'girl', 'little', 'means', 'Emma', 'Stone', 'Gwen', 'Stacy', 'Parker', 'used', 'new', 'powers', 'abilities', 'pursued', 'Gwen', 'father', 'Dennis', 'Leary', 'who', 'just', 'be', 'cop', 'Oh', 'something', 'former', 'coworker', 'Peter', 'father', 'who', 'accidentally', 'murderous', 'lizard', 'random', 'killing', 'sprees', 'have', 'little', 'point', 'certainly', 'look', 'great.Sense', 'skepticism', 'lot', 'dislike', 'here', 'Garfield', 'superb', 'actor', 'proven', 'before', 'good', 'here', 'problem', 'not', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'character', 'HAS', 'been', 'updated', 'bit', 'not', 'total', 'geek', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'portrayal', 'was', 'example', 'just', 'not', 'enough', 'Garfield', 'Stone', 'real', 'life', 'sweeties', 'have', 'great', 'screen', 'chemistry', 'Leary', 'nice', 'edge', 'always', 'doctor/lizard', 'Rhys', 'Ifans', 'solid', 'Alfred', 'Molina', 'Raimi', 'second', 'film', 'just', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'do', 'Lizard', 'Doc', 'Oc', 'least', 'on-screen', 'share', 'lot', 'similarities', 'one', 'fantastic', 'actors', 'cast', 'promising', 'roles', 'then', 'chained', 'down', 'script', 'issues', 'Also', 'enjoyable', 'are', 'Martin', 'Sheen', 'Sally', 'Field', 'Uncle', 'Ben', 'Aunt', 'May', 'look', 'usual', 'hilarious', 'cameo', 'Spidey', 'creator', 'Stan', 'Lee.The', 'script', 'so', 'many', 'holes', 'characters', 'are', 'bound', 'trip', 'up', 'subplot', 'Peter', 'father', 'arguably', 'more', 'interesting', 'anything', 'else', 'here', 'basically', 'forgotten', 'do', ""n't"", 'worry', ""'ll"", 'show', 'up', 'sequel', 'film', 'ending', 'sure', 'Lizard', 'several', 'rampages', 'chasing', 'Spidey', 'when', 'could', 'just', 'easily', 'be', 'going', 'plot', 'bringing', 'New', 'York', 'knees', 'Marc', 'Webb', 'direction', 'solid', 'film', 'more', 'importantly', 'feels', 'amazing', ""'m"", 'harping', 'simply', 'lot', 'dislike', 'also', 'lot', 'love', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'Still', 'Fanboys', 'should', 'be', 'pleased', 'like', 'good', 'superhero', 'popcorn', 'flick', 'AMAZING', 'SPIDER-MAN', 'delivers', 'spades']",The Amazing Spider-Man

1417621,APN1SGMOQV5GO,B004LWZWFQ,Daniel J. Griffin Jr.,"[1, 2]","I was really, really excited when I heard that the Spider-Man movie franchise was going to be rebooted.  I was hoping that this would mean moving Spider-Man to the same movie universe as the Avengers and that the movie itself would be raised to that level of excellence.  Sadly, that's not what happened.Columbia Pictures still has the movie rights to the character of Spider-Man and they cranked this lukewarm effort out apparently to keep those rights.  Most of the movie feels a bit rushed to me and a bit cramped as it feels like the director, the aptly named Marc Webb, tried his best to shoe-horn as much into 2 1/4 hours as he possibly could.The movie had several high points for me.  I enjoyed moving the story back to high school as that gives it a bit of an Ultimate Spider-Man flair.  I also liked having Gwen Stacy as the love interest.  Emma Stone does the character a lot of credit.  I really enjoyed the lack of organic web shooters as that was something that made no sense in the first movie series.  If Peter was going to develop spinnerettes, shouldn't they have been on his butt?  Finally, not bringing in Green Goblin right off the bat was a good move.  Every superhero out there has one archenemy, a nemesis of legendary proportion.  Bringin them in on the first movie is a mistake because where do you go from there?  Either every movie after will have to include the same villian or you have to inflate another lesser villian.Unfortunately the movie has a number of low points as well.  First would have to be the pacing, as mentioned before.  It's difficult to copress 40+ years of comic history into a couple of hours, so don't try.  Just tell a portion of the story.  Deliberately set up a trilogy from the get-go if you have to.  The Lizard's design would be a close second.  Honestly, what was this thing supposed to be?  A design closer to the comics may have worked better than this Jurassic Park wannabe CGI mess that we were treated to but we'll never know now.  Rhys Ifans did a credible job as the human component of the villian, but Webb's desperate attempts to make the monster look like him just don't work.  The script also contains some problems.  Some of the dialogue feels forced and unnatural.  Also, you shouldn't really have a Spider-Man movie and not have the line about power and responsibility, yet for some goofy reason that famous line is completely omitted.  Finally, Andrew Garfield is a low point as well.  I find his portrayal of Peter Parker/Spider-Man to be a bit angsty and sulky.  There's a fair amount of whining going on and it's hard to tell how much is Andrew and how much is the script.  The most amazing thing about the film is that the mask can push down all that hair.Over all, the movie strives desperately to surpass the first two movies of the original trilogy but falls well short.  Fans of the character who've never seen the first movies will probably like this better.  There's some nice action sequences, but the compressed story and stilted script detract from the overall enjoyment.  Maybe they'll do better with the sequel.",3,Really needed a little bit of Sam Raimi in it.,1357516800,"01 7, 2013",2013,3099,"['was', 'really', 'really', 'excited', 'when', 'heard', 'Spider-Man', 'movie', 'franchise', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'rebooted', 'was', 'hoping', 'would', 'mean', 'moving', 'Spider-Man', 'same', 'movie', 'universe', 'Avengers', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'raised', 'level', 'excellence', 'Sadly', 'not', 'what', 'happened.Columbia', 'Pictures', 'still', 'movie', 'rights', 'character', 'Spider-Man', 'cranked', 'lukewarm', 'effort', 'out', 'apparently', 'keep', 'rights', 'Most', 'movie', 'bit', 'rushed', 'bit', 'cramped', 'director', 'aptly', 'named', 'Marc', 'Webb', 'tried', 'best', 'shoe-horn', 'much', '2', '1/4', 'hours', 'possibly', 'could.The', 'movie', 'had', 'several', 'high', 'points', 'enjoyed', 'moving', 'story', 'back', 'high', 'school', 'bit', 'Ultimate', 'Spider-Man', 'flair', 'also', 'liked', 'having', 'Gwen', 'Stacy', 'love', 'interest', 'Emma', 'Stone', 'character', 'lot', 'credit', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'lack', 'organic', 'web', 'shooters', 'was', 'something', 'made', 'sense', 'first', 'movie', 'series', 'Peter', 'was', 'going', 'develop', 'spinnerettes', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'butt', 'Finally', 'not', 'bringing', 'Green', 'Goblin', 'right', 'off', 'bat', 'was', 'good', 'move', 'superhero', 'there', 'one', 'archenemy', 'nemesis', 'legendary', 'proportion', 'Bringin', 'first', 'movie', 'mistake', 'where', 'do', 'go', 'there', 'movie', 'will', 'have', 'include', 'same', 'villian', 'have', 'inflate', 'lesser', 'villian.Unfortunately', 'movie', 'number', 'low', 'points', 'as', 'well', 'First', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'pacing', 'mentioned', 'difficult', 'copress', '40+', 'years', 'comic', 'history', 'couple', 'hours', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'try', 'Just', 'tell', 'portion', 'story', 'Deliberately', 'set', 'up', 'trilogy', 'get-go', 'have', 'Lizard', 'design', 'would', 'be', 'close', 'second', 'Honestly', 'what', 'was', 'thing', 'supposed', 'be', 'design', 'closer', 'comics', 'may', 'have', 'worked', 'better', 'Jurassic', 'Park', 'wannabe', 'CGI', 'mess', 'were', 'treated', ""'ll"", 'never', 'know', 'now', 'Rhys', 'Ifans', 'did', 'credible', 'job', 'human', 'component', 'villian', 'Webb', 'desperate', 'attempts', 'make', 'monster', 'look', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'work', 'script', 'also', 'problems', 'dialogue', 'feels', 'forced', 'unnatural', 'Also', 'should', ""n't"", 'really', 'have', 'Spider-Man', 'movie', 'not', 'have', 'line', 'power', 'responsibility', 'goofy', 'reason', 'famous', 'line', 'completely', 'omitted', 'Finally', 'Andrew', 'Garfield', 'low', 'point', 'as', 'well', 'find', 'portrayal', 'Peter', 'Parker/Spider-Man', 'be', 'bit', 'angsty', 'sulky', 'fair', 'amount', 'whining', 'going', 'hard', 'tell', 'how', 'much', 'Andrew', 'how', 'much', 'script', 'most', 'amazing', 'thing', 'film', 'mask', 'can', 'push', 'down', 'hair.Over', 'movie', 'desperately', 'surpass', 'first', 'two', 'movies', 'original', 'trilogy', 'well', 'short', 'Fans', 'character', 'who', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'first', 'movies', 'will', 'probably', 'better', 'nice', 'action', 'sequences', 'compressed', 'story', 'stilted', 'script', 'detract', 'overall', 'enjoyment', 'Maybe', ""'ll"", 'do', 'better', 'sequel']",The Amazing Spider-Man

1417625,A2I2DE1DJUVQOO,B004LWZWFQ,DarthRad,"[19, 35]","Has it been only ten years since Sam Raimi made the first and best of the Spider-man movies?  Clearly, Sony wanted to keep their billion dollar franchise going, and keep raking in the money.  When Raimi found himself unable to deliver a version of Spider-man 4 that he could live with, Sony abruptly decided to pull the plug on him and the rest of the original cast of characters and do a reboot instead.Ecce ""The Amazing Spider-man"", a poor effort.  The fact that Sony chose to redo the origin story of Spider-man all over again so close to Raimi's masterpiece makes comparisons to the original inevitable, and such a comparison shines a harsh  light on the weak plot and character development and departures from the canonical history of Spider-man in this new version.  The end result is like putting a ""paint by numbers"" version of the Mona Lisa next to the real thing at the Louvre.The movie does have some attractive and very capable actors - people who have done well in other movies.  Unfortunately, they just don't belong in their roles in this movie, and contrast poorly with their counterparts in the Raimi series.  Let's go through the list:Andrew Garfield has been great in other movies, but he is just too cocky and sure of himself to be as good of a Peter Parker as Toby Maguire, who totally captured the essence of the sweet, awkward, nerdy, and angst ridden Peter Parker.  Toby Maguire is and will always be the definitive Peter Parker in my book.Emma Stone, a cute and terrific actress (in other movies) and normally a dark brunette.  For some bizarre reason she got shoehorned into the role of Gwen Stacy, and the result is ... not Gwen Stacy.  Emma Stone's dark hair shows through the bleach in almost every scene.  Gwen was a true blonde, Peter Parker's great love, and Spider-man's damsel in distress.  Gwen was not a rocket scientist, Gwen was taller, slimmer, model-quality beautiful, one of the most beautiful girls in the  Marvel Universe.  She was there to make adolescent boys gawk at her and buy Marvel Comics, and she was there to break Spider-man's heart, when inevitably, she died as a result of his battles with his arch enemy the Green Goblin.  She was not there to prove that girls are smarter than boys nor to show why more girls go to college and get advanced degrees than boys.  In Raimi's version, Bryce Dallas Howard (normally a blondish red head, bleached to a convincing blonde for the role) was much truer to the comic book vision of Gwen Stacy than this Emma Stone version.  Sorry, I really do like Emma Stone as an actress, but SHE...IS...JUST...NOT...GWEN...STACY.Martin Sheen as Uncle Ben is also just totally wrong.  Martin Sheen does intense and slightly nuts characters really well (i.e. ""Apocalypse Now"", his best role ever).  He isn't really convincing as a kind but firm Uncle Ben, and this reboot has Uncle Ben just dripping with a false gooey sweetness.  Cliff Robertson was great on the other hand as Uncle Ben, playing the role just right.  Uncle Ben was a pillar of moral strength, which doesn't really come through in this reboot.  Cliff Robertson, the man who played presidents (JFK), and who got blacklisted in Hollywood for five years for blowing the whistle on embezzlers at Columbia Pictures, yep, he had the moral authority to play Uncle Ben, not the father of Charlie Sheen.The Flying Nun, er, Sally Fields, as Aunt May!  Omigod.  Aunt May had white hair, and was tall and skinny and solemn, and didn't nag so much.  Couldn't they at least get the white hair part right and make Sally Fields stop dyeing her hair? She's 66 years old this year for goodness sake.  Sally Fields is just too perky and whiny and too young-looking to be a good Aunt May.  Rosemary Harris was much closer to the comic book vision of Aunt May than Sally Fields.Denis Leary as Captain Stacy - Leary does hard boiled, foul-mouthed, blue collar characters really well.  That is so not Captain Stacy, however.  James Cromwell, on the other hand, in Raimi's version, was perfect as Captain Stacy, and even looked exactly like the comic book character.Finally, Rhys Ifans as Dr. Curt Connors/Lizard.  ARG!  Dr. Connors is an American! Not a Brit, or Welsh (Ifans)!!  Why change this?  Dylan Baker did a fine job as the original Dr. Connors in a series of tantalizing scenes with Toby Maguire in Spider-man 3, which were very much closer to the comic book history.  In this reboot, Rhys Ifans portrays Dr. Connors as a stuffy British scientist working for Oscorp, and his character development and plot line interactions with Peter Parker don't make much sense.Peter Parker's parents appear in this reboot, but the movie wastes this opportunity to explore a piece of Peter Parker's origins by completely twisting up that story also and wrapping it into the origin story of the Lizard.  And what's worse, the resulting plot line makes no sense either.  It's like the Sony screenwriters were sitting around and decided, hey, let's throw Peter's parents into this movie!  They die in a plane crash just like in the comics!  But let's keep it simple and tie them to the origin of the Lizard!  Huh?Missing from this reboot are other characters wonderfully fleshed out in Raimi's version of the Spider-man universe, like James Jonah Jameson, and Betty Brant, and of course Mary Jane.  Remember them?  (Betty Brant is now in the Hunger Games as Effie Trinket).  Another ""Huh?"" moment - the Flash character in this reboot mysteriously becomes a buddy of Peter Parker after being totally humiliated in the gym by Peter.  Right.A math formula somehow is the key to solving the DNA-genetics-cell regeneration and differentiation puzzle that produces the Lizard?  Huh?  Please, some of us in the movie audience have gone to college and know a little bit about cellular biology.So there you go, besides doing a poor match of actors to comic book characters, besides doing a much worse job of re-enacting the origin story of Spider-man, besides multiple plot holes and ""Huh?"" moments, Spider-man fans should be disturbed that the movie totally distorts the canonical history of Spider-man.  Raimi, a lifelong Spider-man comic book fan, knew his stuff, and was far more true to the comic book vision.  The folks at Sony who hijacked this franchise away from Sam Raimi don't know what they are doing, and this reboot fundamentally lacks the heart and soul and depth of insight about the Spider-man universe that Raimi's movies had.And so they are well on their way to wrecking this franchise.  There is still a huge amount of interest and goodwill from fans of Raimi's Spider-man's movies, and this reboot is likely to do well as a result.  The movies to follow may also do well, much like George Lucas's appalling trio of prequels to his Star Wars franchise.  I may even go see them, like I did the awful Star Wars prequels,  or rent them on Netflix, but it will be mostly out of morbid curiosity, like watching a train wreck, a fascinating deconstruction of a beloved franchise.",2,"Meh...ten years later, a weak reboot that pales compared to the original",1341273600,"07 3, 2012",2012,6999,"['been', 'only', 'ten', 'years', 'Sam', 'Raimi', 'made', 'first',

""i don't want to be known as spider-man all my life"" well then toby don't play iconic characters if you don't want to be known as them. toby probably wasn't even going to be spider-man if even sam raimi directed number four. another thing they did right in this movie was spider-man's sarcasim. spider-man is a sarcastic jerk to the bad guys. which they did not have to much in the others. i like toby mcguire but i think andrew garfield did a little better and i hope he does not complain about beging spider-man this is jump starting his career. and i hope he dosen't fall out of beging the character. twords the end of the film there is a slight hint that they might do green goblin again and if they do please have william defoe play him he was an excellent green goblin. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do. p.s. stan lee's cameo in this movie was the best out of all his cameo's so far",5,Awesome Movie,1342569600,"07 18, 2012",2012,2313,"['really', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'high', 'expectations', 'movie', 'saw', 'anyway', 'friend', 'i', ""'m"", 'big', 'spider-man', 'fan', 'spider-man', 'one', 'favorite', 'superheroes', 'i', 'was', 'astonished', 'how', 'well', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'i', 'loved', 'alot', 'i', 'was', 'not', 'expecting', 'be', 'good', 'andrew', 'garfield', 'did', 'great', 'spider-man', 'i', 'loved', 'lizard', 'most', 'superhero', 'reboot', 'remake', 'movies', 'use', 'same', 'villian', 'one', 'did', 'not', 'i', 'was', 'glad', 'see', 'lizard', 'movie', 'emma', 'stone', 'was', 'great', 'gwen', 'stacey', 'two', 'only', 'real', 'beefs', 'film', 'was', 'uncle', 'ben', 'death', 'spiderbite', 'com', 'y', 'had', 'general', 'idea', 'uncle', 'ben', 'death', 'should', 'stuck', 'original', 'even', 'was', 'done', 'right', 'first', 'movie', 'i', 'did', 'how', 'brought', 'peter', 'parents', 'film', 'pretty', 'big', 'history', 'spider-Man', 'sam', 'raimi', 'was', 'such', 'huge', 'spider-man', 'fan', 'would', 'put', 'first', 'one', 'other', 'thing', 'did', 'right', 'one', 'did', 'not', 'do', 'others', 'was', 'web', 'shooters', 'spider-man', 'always', 'made', 'own', 'web', 'did', 'not', 'gain', 'power', 'did', 'first', 'film', 'i', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'first', 'three', 'were', 'bad', 'sam', 'raimi', 'could', 'done', 'right', 'i', 'guess', 'i', 'can', 'give', 'credit', 'trying', 'something', 'new', 'i', 'hear', 'alot', 'people', 'complain', 'andrew', 'garfield', 'how', 'toby', 'was', 'better', 'do', ""n't"", 'recall', 'saying', 'spider-man', '1', '2', 'i', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'i', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'known', 'spider-man', 'life', 'well', 'then', 'toby', 'do', ""n't"", 'play', 'iconic', 'characters', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'known', 'toby', 'probably', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'going', 'be', 'spider-man', 'even', 'sam', 'raimi', 'directed', 'number', 'four', 'thing', 'did', 'right', 'movie', 'was', 'spider-man', 'sarcasim', 'spider-man', 'sarcastic', 'jerk', 'bad', 'guys', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'much', 'others', 'i', 'toby', 'mcguire', 'i', 'think', 'andrew', 'garfield', 'did', 'little', 'better', 'i', 'hope', 'not', 'complain', 'beging', 'spider-man', 'jump', 'starting', 'career', 'i', 'hope', 'dose', ""n't"", 'fall', 'out', 'beging', 'character', 'end', 'film', 'slight', 'hint', 'might', 'do', 'green', 'goblin', 'again', 'do', 'please', 'have', 'william', 'defoe', 'play', 'was', 'excellent', 'green', 'goblin', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'movie', 'then', 'i', 'recommend', 'do', 'p.s', 'stan', 'lee', 'cameo', 'movie', 'was', 'best', 'cameo', 'so', 'far']",The Amazing Spider-Man

The main character of Peter Parker has more angst due to the fine performance of Andrew Garfield. This angst is much more in line with the original comic books from Marvel. Peter is highly conflicted about his duties as a budding crime fighter, and for his efforts he is labeled a criminal by the police and news media. I was surprised initially to hear Garfield was going to take the main role, but after viewing the film and seeing the unique style he adds to the Spider-Man character, I am completely sold. He has a wiry physique that fits the Spider-Man character perfectly. Garfield is able to hit those iconic poses shown in the comics version. I thoroughly enjoy Emma Stone in everything she does.

The script is probably slightly tighter than the first Spidey film overall, but it doesn't have nearly as strong a climax.  The leads in both films are well-cast and have nice chemistry.

1417641,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B004LWZWFQ,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[0, 0]","For generations, many children, teens and adults have grown-up reading ""The Amazing Spider-Man"".  The Marvel Comics series was created by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko back in 1963 and in December 2012, will end it's run (the series will be temporarily replaced with a new series titled ""Superior Spider-Man"" as part of the Marvel NOW! line).But many people have grown up with Spider-Man, may it be the comic books, video games, animated series, live action series and in the last decade, treated with three live -action films directed by Sam Raimi.But one thing that Marvel Comics have done for new generation of readers was to create an Ultimate Line featuring a story that has little similarity to the original history of a character or group, but revised for a modern audience, with a modern storyline.And while the three Sam Raimi films were blockbuster films that made a lot of money, it would end as a trilogy as the success of the films would set a pretty high price tag to retain filmmaker Sam Raimi and its main cast. also, the price tag for the original cast to continue in the films was quite high.  And the budget for the films were also quite high.So, how to get away from that high price tag?  Reboot the film series and making it different from the original storyline using modern elements.And so, we have ""The Amazing Spider-Man"", a film directed by Marc Webb (""(500) Days of Summer) and a screenplay by James Vanderbilt (""Zodiac"", ""The Losers"", ""The Rundown""), Alvin Sargent (writer for ""Spider-Man 2&#8243;, ""Spider-Man 3&#8243;, ""Unfaithful"") and Steve Kloves (""Harry Potter"" films, ""The Fabulous Baker Boys"").The film would star Andrew Garfield (""The Social Network"", ""The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus""), Emma Stone (""The Help"", ""Easy A"", ""Zombieland""), Rhys Ifans (""Notting Hill"", ""Anonymous"", ""Little Nicky""), Denis Leary (""Rescue Me"", ""Ice Age""), Martin Sheen (""The West Wing"", ""Apocalypse now"", ""The Departed"") and Sally Field (""Forest Gump"", ""Brothers and Sisters"", ""Mrs. Doubtfire"").VIDEO:""The Amazing Spider-Man"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:40:1 aspect ratio).  And as one can expect, this film looks absolutely magnificent on Blu-ray.  Everything from the detail of Spider-Man's costume, detail on the strands of webbing to the beautiful skyline and of course, character close-ups, the film looks absolutely gorgeous.  Even the shots from high above the city looking down towards Spider-Man and just the overall look and environment looks believable and breathtaking.  Black levels are inky and deep, skin tones are natural and if anything, videophiles will no doubt love how ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" looks on Blu-ray!It is important to note that there is a 3D release of the film on Blu-ray (not included with the Blu-ray+DVD+UltraViolet version).AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""The Amazing Spider-Man"" is presented in English, French, Portuguese 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio, Chinese, Thai 5.1 Dolby Digital.  And as one can expect from this film, filled with many action-packed scenes, the lossless soundtrack sounds magnificent and is truly immersive.The use of surround is done remarkably well.  From Spider-Man shooting out his web, swinging through the city to Peter Parker being thrown around by the Lizard to getting into a fight with Flash, the dialogue and special effects are crystal clear and good use of surround sound usage and LFE.But also equally impressive is James Horner's music for the film.  There are tracks that just captivate you, such as the wonderful ""The Ganali Device"" which showcases James Horner's piano playing.  But you will also have the action-driven sequence  upbeat tracks such as ""The Bridge"", ""Lizard at School!"", ""Saving New York"" (which was an effective style of James Horner to use the piano in such a way).For the most part, James Horner is a master in creating beautiful music, emotional music.  From his orchestral direction, his use of piano, voice utilization, the music for ""The Amazing Spider-Man is original and manages to be different than Elfman's ""Spider-Man"" compositions.Similar to the film, the soundtrack for ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" is emotional and he builds upon each track that it begins to grow on you and you find yourself enjoying the soundtrack even more.But I have to say that this is one of the most original soundtracks when it comes to how the piano is utilized.  But at the same time, aiming for beauty, aiming for emotion, there is not a score that  found that sticks out, a track that I found memorable.Subtitles are in English, English SDH, Chinese (Mandarin Traditional), Chinese (Mandarin Mandarin Simplified), Chinese (Mandarin Traditional), English (US), French (Canadian), French (Parisian), Indonesian / Bahasa, Korean, Portuguese (Brazil), Spanish (Latin Am) and Thai.SPECIAL FEATURES""The Amazing Spider-Man"" comes with the following special features:Amazing Spider-Man Second Screen App - On disc supporting content - You can watch the film at the same time on your smartphone or tablet.Commentary with Marc Webb, Avi Arad and Matt Tolmach - Insightful audio commentary by director Marc Webb, producers Avi Arad and Matt Tolmach.

You're just just not going to get a 100% faithful film adaptation.  And it's best to come into watching a film based on popular superhero and just accepting that things will be different, while some things will be similar but most importantly, how effective the story will be be, especially the superhero itself.""The Avengers"" and even the recent Dark Knight (Batman) films have shown how these films could be exciting, well-written and enjoyable.  So, can ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" right?For ""Spider-Man"" fans who are trying to forget the third Sam Raimi ""Spider-Man"" film, fortunately, ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" manages to incorporate a good balance between the old and the new.First, let's talk about the storyline.  The evergoing battle between Spider-Man and the Lizard has been ongoing for so long in the comic books. A good choice for antagonist but it's also a good way to show a connection Oscorp Industries because of this Peter Parker/Gwen Stacy storyline.But one thing that was never introduced in the original comic books was Peter Parker's parents.  It became more of a bigger topic in the '90s when Marvel introduced this nonsense of clones, but for the film, I actually enjoyed how they brought in the parents, made things a mystery and unlike the comic books, trying not to have this Weapon X connection.  While it's too early to see how this plays out, I'm glad the subject was introduced into this film.As a ""Spider-Man"" fan, while the Peter Parker and Mary Jane Watson storyline (and their happiness as a couple to a married couple) will always be important in the life of Peter Parker, what is also important is the relationship between Peter Parker and Gwen Stacy.Before Peter Parker and Mary Jane, the story of Gwen Stacy has always been important in the Spider-Man universe because Peter Parker will truly learn about the great responsibility he has of being a super-hero.  While a lot of us who have read the comic book series, pretty much knows what will happen to Gwen Stacy, I felt that the writers did a good service for fans by making Gwen the counterpart to Peter Parker.""The Amazing Spider-Man"" is a film that tries to make compromises with both classic and modern versions.  While Peter Parker is seen as a non-popular guy in ""The Amazing Spider-Man"", gone is the science nerd with glasses.  Also, modern technology plays a big part of the film.I've always wondered how a high school student would effectively create powerful webs with the technology used back in the '60s but at least with ""The Amazing Spider-Man"", Peter Parker utilizing technology from Oscorp Industries, makes sense.I actually like the costume design for ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" this time around and with the always change in technology, the special effects for ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" looks absolutely fantastic.  When you see Spider-Man swinging from building to building, you can feel the height and was quite pleased with how technology has improved since the release of the past ""Spider-Man"" trilogy.But it's the characters that really brought a lot heart and soul to the film.  Andrew Garfield may not look super nerdy but he played the part of Peter Parker quite effectively.  Different from Tobey Maguire's portrayal of Spider-Man, I felt that Garfield brought a positive, cool vibe to the character that fans can sympathize for.Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy was fantastic!  Just the final scene alone with Peter Parker, just the look in her eyes and the smile she gives, is more than enough to make me feel that the right person was cast for the role!And while Sally Field may not look like the elderly Aunt May that was portrayed in the comic books, to have Sally Field and Martin Sheen play Uncle Ben and Aunt May was another positive when it comes to casting.  Both also did a wonderful job.And last, Denis Leary did a wonderful job of playing Captain Stacy.  You need a man with attitude to play the role and he nailed it!As for the primary antagonist, while Rhys Ifans did a great job with Dr. Curt Connors, I was a little iffy when it came to the Lizard's design.  I wanted to see more the protruding snout that was seen of the character in the comic books with the razor sharp fangs and hissing long tongue.  He looked more like an alien from out of space or swamp creature than the Lizard that I was hoping to see.But I felt the writers did a wonderful job of separating this reboot from the Sam Raimi trilogy.  And because Gwen Stacy is the love of Peter Parker in this film, one can only wonder how things will playout in the second film.But overall, I felt that Marc Webb was able to craft a different kind of Spider-Man film that although not 100% faithful to the comic book series, does a magnificent job in capturing those important elements and is able to take the plot and entertain audiences of today!And with newer technology for CG and special effects, the film looks very fluid during the more action-intense sequences and it played to this film's overall efficacy.Speaking of technology, for the Blu-ray release, it's important to note that there are two versions out on Blu-ray.  One includes the 3D version of the film, while this Blu-ray release features the film via Blu-ray, DVD and UltraViolet.The Blu-ray is bundled with many special features and the picture quality and lossless audio is fantastic!  Video and audiophiles should be pleased with this Blu-ray release.""The Amazing Spider-Man"" was a risky film to reboot, not long after the original ""Spider-Man"" trilogy had ended.  But with over 60-years of comic book history, there is a lot of Spider-Man stories to be told.  And one of those most significant storylines involve Spider-Man and Gwen Stacy.While Spider-Man fans know how much of an impact Gwen Stacy had on Peter Parker's life through the comic books, what better than to bring these two characters and put them in the forefront of this Marvel reboot.  Where the Sam Raimi films did a lot of experimentation of Spider-Man, the superhero, especially his relationship with Mary Jane Watson.Also, ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" manages to take the character to a more modern setting and for the most part, the technology behind Peter Parker's web shooters to the modern technology utilized in his suit, now makes sense.  But it was important to make that distinction of how Peter Parker, a science whiz, was able to incorporate this technology for Spider-Man.  You have to have that connection and that connection is with Oscorp Industries and if you have Oscorp, comic fans know what hopefully, the future of this film series will lead to.""The Amazing Spider-Man"" may not be the most faithful film when it comes to film adaptation from the original comic books, but then again, not many superhero films are.Overall, the film turned out to be much more exciting, much more deeper than I was expecting.  And every ounce of skepticism that I once had, was no longer there.  Sure, I enjoyed ""The Avengers"" much, much more than ""The Amazing Spider-Man"", but I have to admit that I enjoyed this film much more than any of the three Sam Raimi films.  I felt the way the characters were handled, was much more effective.Especially the handling of the Peter's parents but also this new, fresh and cool vibe with its characters utilizing modern technology and setting.  Everything seemed right!  The technology seemed right!  And with the solid performances by its characters with a much more entertaining storyline, there is no doubt in my mind that this is the best ""Spider-Man"" film yet!I absolutely enjoyed ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" and I loved this Blu-ray release for its wonderful PQ, AQ and the special features galore!Highly recommended!",4,"Blu-ray: ""Amazing Spider-Man"" features fantastic PQ and

We all know that Spiderman (as a Marvel comics, Steve Ditko created entity) can now be traced back as the source to an almost infinite number of splintered ""re-boots"" (going back to the 70's TV series with Nicholas Hammond or the much loved original animated series).Now as consumers we are partly to blame, after all, the studio's dangle the carrots in front of us and we take the bait EVERY time. That's where i put the other half of the responsibility, on the studios. We, as consumers, put a certain amount of trust in you, so that when you say ""Here's a NEW version of a movie you already own, but this is really worth buying it twice..."", we tend (or want) to believe you.Obviously HD was a significant leap (the whole HD DVD vs Blu-ray battle), then came 3D (to me, the jury is still out on this one considering all the other equipment needed to enjoy a legitimate 3D experience), but now Sony is pushing this 4K line of re-releases. So pardon me for treading lightly, but can someone please ""sell me"" on the idea of why i should ""re-purchase"" many of my existing blu-rays based solely on the addition of the characters ""4K""???I hope we're not already at the point where the studios simply rotate tacking on random adjectives like ""New, Super, Good, Improved, Ultra, Special-Edition"" to the title with minimal actual change to the subject matter just to pocket our ""double dip dollars""...i mean, i have to believe that there is (and will always be) some level of ""give and take"". So for every dollar the studio wants to ""take"", they will at least ""give"" me something for it.I really, really want to believe this is the case.

1417658,A1TJIJKKN15KR9,B004LWZWFQ,drqshadow,"[0, 2]","I appreciate this franchise's need to distance itself from the missteps of Spider-Man 3, to start from scratch with a villain besides the Green Goblin, and to get back to the character's roots as an awkward kid in an adult's costume, wise-cracking to mask his uncertainty. I even like the decision go completely Mary Jane-free, as I felt the old ""girl next door is the only one for me"" story was a path the Raimi films walked far too quickly. Despite those perfectly noble, admirable intentions, though, this reboot just doesn't click for me. In the ten years since the first Spider-Man, the landscape of cinematic superheroics has changed dramatically. The Avengers family has upped the action ante, while Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy has proven a hero's story can be about more than just the mask. With the glut of action heroes now on the scene, Peter Parker needed this chance to differentiate himself, but instead he fades further into the wallpaper. Andrew Garfield turns in a laudable effort, but his renditions of Parker and Spider-Man are written to be so drastically different, it's often tough to imagine they're actually the same person. I had a hard time watching Peter doom and gloom over his Uncle while at school, then immediately toss out wacky jokes at night, in the midst of hunting his killer. Martin Sheen is the film's only real standout as poor, ill-fated Uncle Ben, but that's a role so inherently sympathetic that it would take an unmitigated disaster to screw up. All things considered it's certainly not a bad effort; the cast is loyal to the source while still seeming contemporary, the action scenes are breathtaking (if surprisingly infrequent) and enough leftovers remain on the table to feed several sequels. But several dull spots, a foil that seems too run-of-the-mill and universally inconsistent characterization stop it from being as amazing as the title would have us believe.",3,"A Bit Too Familiar, Spider-Man's Relaunch Struggles to Differentiate Itself",1353024000,"11 16, 2012",2012,1920,"['appreciate', 'franchise', 'need', 'distance', 'missteps', 'Spider-Man', '3', 'start', 'scratch', 'villain', 'Green', 'Goblin', 'get', 'back', 'character', 'roots', 'awkward', 'kid', 'adult', 'costume', 'wise-cracking', 'mask', 'uncertainty', 'even', 'decision', 'go', 'completely', 'Mary', 'Jane-free', 'felt', 'old', 'girl', 'next', 'door', 'only', 'one', 'story', 'was', 'path', 'Raimi', 'films', 'walked', 'far', 'too', 'quickly', 'perfectly', 'noble', 'admirable', 'intentions', 'though', 'reboot', 'just', ""n't"", 'click', 'ten', 'years', 'first', 'Spider-Man', 'landscape', 'cinematic', 'superheroics', 'changed', 'dramatically', 'Avengers', 'family', 'upped', 'action', 'ante', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'Batman', 'trilogy', 'proven', 'hero', 'story', 'can', 'be', 'about', 'more', 'just', 'mask', 'glut', 'action', 'heroes', 'now', 'scene', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'needed', 'chance', 'differentiate', 'instead', 'further', 'wallpaper', 'Andrew', 'Garfield', 'laudable', 'effort', 'renditions', 'Parker', 'Spider-Man', 'are', 'written', 'be', 'so', 'drastically', 'different', 'often', 'tough', 'imagine', ""'re"", 'actually', 'same', 'person', 'had', 'hard', 'time', 'watching', 'Peter', 'doom', 'gloom', 'Uncle', 'school', 'then', 'immediately', 'toss', 'out', 'wacky', 'jokes', 'night', 'midst', 'hunting', 'killer', 'Martin', 'Sheen', 'film', 'only', 'real', 'standout', 'poor', 'ill-fated', 'Uncle', 'Ben', 'role', 'so', 'inherently', 'sympathetic', 'would', 'take', 'unmitigated', 'disaster', 'screw', 'up', 'things', 'considered', 'certainly', 'not', 'bad', 'effort', 'cast', 'loyal', 'source', 'still', 'seeming', 'contemporary', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'breathtaking', 'surprisingly', 'infrequent', 'enough', 'leftovers', 'remain', 'table', 'feed', 'several', 'sequels', 'several', 'dull', 'spots', 'foil', 'too', 'run-of-the-mill', 'universally', 'inconsistent', 'characterization', 'stop', 'being', 'as', 'amazing', 'title', 'would', 'have', 'believe']",The Amazing Spider-Man
1417659,A106YXO3EHVD3J,B004LWZWFQ,"DR SHOCK ""MR. KIA RETURNS! ;-b""","[6, 6]","I'm a big fan of all three Raimi Spider Man films and when I heard they were doing a reboot I was skeptical, but being a fan of the character for over 40 years I decided to go see this film.The Good: 1) We get the wisecracking Web Head from the comics, 2) The special effects are excellent, 3) A better Gwen Stacy. 4) Mechanical web shooters 5) The best Stan Lee Cameo ever!The Bad: 1) This wisecracking Web Head is a little too mean spirited and Peter is way too cool to be the nerdy outcast from the comics. 2) The Lizard is poorly designed, he isn't sympathetic like in the comics and that takes a lot away from the character. He is much more interesting if he can't control his changing into The Lizard and having a family gives the character complexity. 3) They don't utilize the fact that his web shooters are mechanical and even though they weren't organic in the comic books, I prefer that route in the live action films. 6) When uncle Ben dies, it isn't heartfelt and Peter doesn't show enough emotion about it.Toby McGuire may not have been the perfect wise cracker in the Raimi films, but he was engaging to watch when not in Spider Man mode. This was key to making a super hero film that was entertaining through out the entire film. (like Robert Downey as Iron Man).I know a lot of people complained about Spider Man taking his mask off all the time, but if you think about it that mask would have to be extremely uncomfortable and hot, so I think that is just a realistic observation by the filmmakers, but some times emotions are needed to be seen and you can't see expressions through the mask.The Amazing Spider Man is a very good film, but I won't watch it nearly as many times as the Raimi Spider Man films. It just isn't as much fun or as good. The Blu Ray has a very good transfer and some interesting bonus material, but nothing like the Raimi Spider man films received on their 2 disc DVD sets.Looking forward to seeing Spider Man 2 on opening day. :-DUpdate *** Went to see the 2nd film in this series and I was pretty disappointed.

1417662,A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ,B004LWZWFQ,"E. A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[1, 2]","There was a lot of automatic backlash when it was announced that after three Sam Raimi movies, the franchise was being completely rebooted.But to be honest, ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" is a pretty solid reboot -- while not as necessary as the ""Incredible Hulk"" reboot was, it's a thoroughly solid little superhero movie that is pretty enjoyable when seen just for itself. It's gritty and has some dark moments, but it also has a lot of wisecracking wit and a new Spiderman who fits the bill perfectly.Peter Parker was left with his Aunt May (Sally Field) and Uncle Ben (Martin Sheen), while his parents fled for parts unknown. Then they were killed in a plane crash.Years later, Peter (Andrew Garfield) finds a battered briefcase with a bunch of his father's old papers. Wanting to find out more about his dad's research, he sneaks into Oscorp Tower to find his father's old buddy, Dr. Connors (Rhys Ifans). But while he's there, he accidentally wanders into a room of glowing spiders -- and one of them bites him. Within hours, he's gained super-strength, amazing reflexes, and the ability to cling to any surface he touches.But then Uncle Ben is murdered after a squabble with his nephew, and a distraught Peter begins hunting down all criminals who resemble the killer. He even creates a ""luge"" costume and mask to hide his identity. At the same time, Dr. Connors puts his research to work -- and becomes a monstrous reptilian creature determined to make all the people in the city like him...First, a warning: ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" is not really the same story as Sam Raimi's ""Spiderman"" -- the basic bitten-by-radioactive-spider thing is the same, but the circumstances, plot and villain are all vastly different. Even the love interest is vastly different. Mary Jane is nowhere to be seen in this story; it's all about Gwen Stacy.And the simplicity of having the Lizard as a villain allows more time to explore the ""early days"" of Spiderman. We get to see how Peter practices swinging around in an abandoned warehouse, the origin of his mask and his ""luge"" suit, how he built his webshooters, and even his webslinging goes from awkward and panicked to downright polished by the end.And the writing is pretty entertaining -- lots of web-slinging action, some nice romantic tension with Gwen (and plain ol' tension with her father), and some good fight scenes. But there's also lots of funny stuff as well -- Peter gets in a lot of wisecracks (""Nobody seems to grasp the point of the mask!"") and scenarios (Stan Lee's cameo).The biggest problem is a scene -- complete with inspiring music -- where ALL the construction workers help a wounded Spiderman by lining cranes up for him. The cheese in that scene is so thick, it smells of Camembert.It also has some lovely characterization on all fronts. Andrew Garfield is wonderful as Peter -- he looks geeky and weedy, but still with the wiry look of a fighter and the sensibilities of a teen boy (""CROOOOTTCH!""). And he plays some of the more comedic scenes with just the right amount of humor (such as when Peter ACCIDENTALLY beats up a bunch of thugs on a subway).The rest of the cast is also quite good -- Ifans plays Connors as a tragic man obsessed with his lost arm, and driven half to madness by the serum. He's a totally plausible villain, yet there are moments where you pity him. And they flesh out all the supporting characters nicely, from Chief Stacy (who becomes overly obsessed with catching Spiderman to the exclusion of, oh, I dunno... THE GIANT KILLER LIZARD) to Flash, a bully who begins to change his ways when Peter shows him up.""The Amazing Spider-Man"" is a solid reimagining of the Spiderman origin story -- it's gritty, solid, and shows a believable transition into superherodom.

1417666,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B004LWZWFQ,Ed Uyeshima,"[5, 12]","A reboot of the Spider-Man franchise feels awfully premature given it's only been a decade since thefirst Sam Raimi-directed epichit the big screen with Tobey Maguire in the title role, and it's been just five years since the release ofSpider-Man 3. Moreover, some of us have had the misfortune of seeing the bombastic Broadway debacle that isSpider-Man: Turn Off the Darkthis past year complete with an unmemorably deafening score by Bono. Here is yet another version of the superhero's familiar origin story presented in this 2012 adventure epic from director Marc Webb ((500) Days Of Summer) and a trio of accomplished screenwriters - James Vanderbilt, Alvin Sargent (who co-wrote 2 and 3 of the previous trilogy as well as several classic films), and Steve Kloves (who adapted most of theHarry Potterseries). Although they go back to Peter Parker's tragic childhood in the prologue, the set-up is otherwise identical to the previous iterations except aspiring actress Mary Jane Watson is nowhere to be seen. Instead, there is spunky Gwen Stacy, a police captain's daughter, the chief intern at the OsCorp Corporation, and Peter's high school crush.Webb focuses much of his movie, especially the first half, to the burgeoning relationship between Peter and Gwen, and this turns out to be a smart move since the screenwriters appear otherwise strait-jacketed by the recognizable constraints of the back story. Raised by his kindly Uncle Ben and Aunt May, Peter is the same brilliant geek and social outcast in this movie, but he's given a more brooding sense of anguish by Andrew Garfield (The Social Network) - who at 28, can still get away with playing a teen. The plot starts to accelerate when Peter stumbles upon his father's old briefcase filled with complex formulas that lead him to an old colleague of his father's, Dr. Curt Connors, now a top scientist at OsCorp.  Connors' focus is on cross-species genetics which he hopes will produce ""a world without weakness"", a personal cause to him since losing his right arm. While at OsCorp, Peter gets bitten by a spider that gives birth to his super powers. When Uncle Ben is later killed by a thief during a sidewalk scuffle, Peter decides to become a vigilante hero who is at odds with the police, which of course, means butting heads with Gwen's by-the-book father.However, things really come to a head with the appearance of the Lizard, who causes havoc first in a fatalistic traffic jam on the Williamsburg Bridge and then at Peter's high school. The inevitable battle of good versus evil takes its toll on the city and on our beleaguered hero with the requisite special effects given a full showcase to bring the movie to a rousing finish. That finish occurs over a wearying 136-minute running time, fairly excessive given the familiarity of the story. Perhaps if the Lizard represented something more interesting than a straight-up Jekyll-and-Hyde metamorphosis, it wouldn't have felt quite as long. Although Webb handles the numerous action scenes with surprising acuity given this is only his second feature film as a director, he brings a level of personal intimacy to the movie that a typical action director would likely have bypassed so as not to alienate the fanboy audience. It's also a good thing that Webb hired two bright actors to bring human scale to the love story at the center of this comic book adventure. Beyond Garfield's solid work, a blonde Emma Stone brings her innately sharp manner to a character that could have easily turned into a simplistic damsel in distress.Together the two attractive leads have a palpable chemistry that bodes well for the inevitable sequels. Last seen as the suspicious academic inThe Five-Year Engagement, Rhys Ifans plays Connors with similar caginess and with the help of CGI effects, fulfills his villainous quotient fitfully. The rest of the stellar supporting cast feels somewhat underserved within the story's dimensions. Denis Leary plays Gwen's father with his trademark casual authority but perhaps at the expense of the character's needed gravitas toward the end. With two Oscars, Sally Field can certainly do more than look constantly concerned, the basic requirement here, but leave it to the veteran actress to provide more depth to the fretful Aunt May. Martin Sheen seems to have the best grasp on his character's blue-collar sensibilities as Uncle Ben. James Horner's music struck me as overly bombastic for the stealth-like movements of Spider-Man, while John Schwartzman's cinematography is a bit on the murky side during the nighttime shots, especially during the climax. I just wish the whole venture could have enthralled me more, but despite some clear virtues with this latest installment, Sam Raimi still casts too foreboding a shadow from my perspective.",3,Garfield

1417668,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B004LWZWFQ,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[1, 2]","THE AMAZING SPIDERMAN (2012, 135 minutes) is so incredibly fun and enjoyable I'm not even going to think too much for this review. Needless to say, this is another stab at young Peter Parker and his Spiderman origin story. It was fun, amazingly moving (due to the stellar cast and grade-A performances) and very funny.What people tend to forget is Spiderman began his career at 16--still in high school and at first, a very goofy, immature boy. Stan Lee seems to want us to remember that, because he wants us to remember what we were like at 16. So having gotten all that out, and assuring you this movie is a good DVD investment, let me spill out my random thoughts:1. Andrew Garfield, a California-born Jewish kid raised in Surrey, England, is a beautiful, riveting actor. At present he looks a bit like a cross between Zac Efron and DJ Qualls. You may recall him appearing on DOCTOR WHO in 2006, and most of his work has been on British TV. WARNING, America: please don't start calling him ""A-Garf"" or you will answer to me!Here, when he had emotional moments and cried, I also shed a tear. Garfield has the ability to be that effective, almost like a mesmerizer. For myself, being gay has always had its painful drawbacks, and Andrew Garfield is an excellent example of such. However, both Garfield himself and the film seem to be exploring Peter Parker being gay--and I LOVE that. There is a handsome school bully who seems to target Parker because he secretly rather fancies him. Let me leave it there and only hope Garfield has a stellar career in store.2. The casting is so brilliant it paralyzes my mind. Sally Field is unbeatable and if we're in for sequels, she has got to stay the course. Aunt May indeed! No tiny, shriveled, white-haired old lady here! (As to any sequels: let's hope they've learned from the last Spiderman film series. My guess is ""not"" and I already know a sequel is slated for release in England in May 2014.)3. The effects made my head spin (sometimes literally and I don't like that). They are good and believable enough to be fun--but I think this abuse of CGI and 3D cartoonish nonsense is going to be the undoing of movies very soon if producers aren't careful. I commend THE AMAZING SPIDERMAN for its relative restraint.4. The music is also upbeat yet unobtrusive: the perfect use of the score, which is a soundtrack to lift the emotions to meet the movie action--not to intrude/make your ears bleed.5. Stan Lee's de rigueur uncredited cameo here is his best yet--and the scene incredibly kinetic, funny and may I say, operatic.6. Martin Sheen and Rhys Ifans are both stunning and superstar presences, yet they recede into their characters as happens in all good film. Ifans in particular is as stunning here as he was in the HARRY POTTER films. Sheen is always a competent, powerful presence too.Get this. You will not regret it and I think this is a great film for kids, because this time the ""Peter Parker/Uncle Ben"" moral message is loud and clear--unlike every other time they've tried to get it across to audiences. The violence, though I think necessary to the story, is not gratuitous nor is it graphic.In fact I was sort of fearing what Spiderman might do when he found the man who murdered his Uncle Ben--but I never seemed to catch that scene. Did Spiderman ever even find him? Anyone know for sure? Stan Lee and everyone involved has done the good old superhero movie genre very proud: no one here is a real horrendous villain. Everyone has shades of a superhero and only thin, skinny little shadows of wrongdoing or evil intentions. Like everyone.Did I mention Andrew Garfield is extremely, extremely hot?",5,"If you're going to waste time/money on an immediate remake, it should at least be as excellent as this one",1386979200,"12 14, 2013",2013,3657,"['AMAZING', 'SPIDERMAN', '2012', '135', 'minutes', 'so', 'incredibly', 'fun', 'enjoyable', ""'m"", 'not', 'even', 'going', 'think', 'too', 'much', 'review', 'Needless', 'say', 'stab', 'young', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'Spiderman', 'origin', 'story', 'was', 'fun', 'amazingly', 'moving', 'due', 'stellar', 'cast', 'grade-A', 'performances', 'very', 'funny.What', 'people', 'tend', 'forget', 'Spiderman', 'began', 'career', '16', 'still', 'high', 'school', 'first', 'very', 'goofy', 'immature', 'boy', 'Stan', 'Lee', 'want', 'remember', 'remember', 'what', 'were', 'like', '16', 'So', 'having', 'gotten', 'out', 'assuring', 'movie', 'good', 'DVD', 'investment', 'let', 'spill', 'out', 'random', 'thoughts:1', 'Andrew', 'Garfield', 'California-born', 'Jewish', 'kid', 'raised', 'Surrey', 'England', 'beautiful', 'riveting', 'actor', 'present', 'bit', 'cross', 'Zac', 'Efron', 'DJ', 'Qualls', 'may', 'recall', 'appearing', 'DOCTOR', 'WHO', '2006', 'most', 'work', 'been', 'British', 'TV', 'WARNING', 'America', 'please', 'do', ""n't"", 'start', 'calling', 'A-Garf', 'will', 'answer', 'Here', 'when', 'had', 'emotional', 'moments', 'cried', 'also', 'shed', 'tear', 'Garfield', 'ability', 'be', 'effective', 'almost', 'mesmerizer', 'being', 'gay', 'always', 'had', 'painful', 'drawbacks', 'Andrew', 'Garfield', 'excellent', 'example', 'such', 'However', 'Garfield', 'film', 'seem', 'be', 'exploring', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'being', 'gay', 'LOVE', 'handsome', 'school', 'bully', 'who', 'target', 'Parker', 'secretly', 'rather', 'Let', 'leave', 'there', 'only', 'hope', 'Garfield', 'stellar', 'career', 'store.2', 'casting', 'so', 'brilliant', 'mind', 'Sally', 'Field', 'unbeatable', ""'re"", 'sequels', 'got', 'stay', 'course', 'Aunt', 'May', 'indeed', 'tiny', 'shriveled', 'white-haired', 'old', 'lady', 'here', 'sequels', 'let', 'hope', ""'ve"", 'learned', 'last', 'Spiderman', 'film', 'series', 'My', 'guess', 'not', 'already', 'know', 'sequel', 'slated', 'release', 'England', 'May', '2014.', '3', 'effects', 'made', 'head', 'spin', 'sometimes', 'literally', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'are', 'good', 'believable', 'enough', 'be', 'fun', 'think', 'abuse', 'CGI', '3D', 'cartoonish', 'nonsense', 'going', 'be', 'undoing', 'movies', 'very', 'soon', 'producers', 'are', ""n't"", 'careful', 'commend', 'AMAZING', 'SPIDERMAN', 'relative', 'restraint.4', 'music', 'also', 'upbeat', 'yet', 'unobtrusive', 'perfect', 'use', 'score', 'soundtrack', 'lift', 'emotions', 'meet', 'movie', 'action', 'not', 'intrude/make', 'ears', 'bleed.5', 'Stan', 'Lee', 'de', 'rigueur', 'uncredited', 'cameo', 'here', 'best', 'yet', 'scene', 'incredibly', 'kinetic', 'funny', 'may', 'say', 'operatic.6', 'Martin', 'Sheen', 'Rhys', 'Ifans', 'are', 'stunning', 'superstar', 'presences', 'yet', 'recede', 'characters', 'happens', 'good', 'film', 'Ifans', 'particular', 'stunning', 'here', 'was', 'HARRY', 'POTTER', 'films', 'Sheen', 'always', 'competent', 'powerful', 'presence', 'too.Get', 'will', 'not', 'regret', 'think', 'great', 'film', 'kids', 'time', 'Peter', 'Parker/Uncle', 'Ben', 'moral', 'message', 'loud', 'clear', 'other', 'time', ""'ve"", 'tried', 'get', 'audiences', 'violence', 'think', 'necessary', 'story', 'not', 'gratuitous', 'graphic.In', 'fact', 'was', 'sort', 'fearing', 'what', 'Spiderman', 'might', 'do', 'when', 'found', 'man', 'who', 'murdered', 'Uncle', 'Ben', 'never', 'seemed', 'catch', 'scene', 'Did', 'Spiderman', 'ever', 'even', 'find', 'Anyone', 'know', 'sure', 'Stan', 'Lee', 'everyone', 'involved', 'done', 'good', 'old', 'superhero', 'movie', 'genre', 'very', 'proud', 'one', 'here', 'real', 'horrendous', 'villain', 'Everyone', 'shades', 'superhero', 'only', 'thin', 'skinny', 'little', 'shadows', 'wrongdoing', 'evil', 'intentions', 'everyone.Did', 'mention', 'Andrew', 'Garfield', 'extremely', 'extremely', 'hot']",The Amazing Spider-Man
1417669,A1TOH8S8I1VT9R,B004LWZWFQ,"E K Maxmias ""Frighteningly Real""","[13, 23]","Let's start with the qualifiers:  I thoroughly enjoy comic book movies, even from comics I've never read.  As a kid, I spent a lot of time writing and drawing my own comic books and then re-wrote and re-drew them as I improved.  So, I can understand the desire to remake something that might have flaws.  My problem is I think this film has more problems than its predecessor.  The old adage; ""if it ain't broke don't fix it"" comes to mind.  Of course, the original Sam Raimi version wasn't perfect but it certainly didn't fail.  Let's swing into the details.WHAT WAS BROKEN?The original ""Spiderman"" did a great job of capturing the spirit and feel, if not the story of the original comic book.  All the characters felt ""right"" and in their proper place.  The film had a colorful style much like the comic.  The films story was the comic book digested and perfected.  In my mind, the only real weak spot might have been the special effects, which were state-of the-art at the time, but look somewhat dated today.  But above all these things, the one thing I liked about the original was that it was highly entertaining.  In comparison, ""The Amazing Spiderman"" failed where the original succeeded and vice-versa.  The visual effects were mostly spectacular (Lizard not withstanding) but everything else was lacking.  The story lacked the flow of the original.  We lost many fun characters (Jamison?) or changed them (Gwen for Marryjane).  The overall feel was much too dark.  Finally, everybody was in the wrong place.  Especially with the absence of the daily bugle did the new film seem- well, lost.  So this film didn't feel right to me.  Though perhaps more true to the original comic, it was not as much fun.  So, no; I don't think this film needed to be made.  However, Does that totally devalue the re-do as a stand-alone?FAILING ON ITS OWNTo give a film three stars there had better be more wrong with it than ""I liked the original better"".  How about treating a film all dark and seriously, trying to have more plausible explanations for things (based on the rules you've defined).  That's ok, but you'd better be consistent and you'd better not cheat at the end for the stories convenience.  Well, ""The Amazing Spiderman"" does this very quickly.  One example is the desire to explain his ability to climb walls.  The original film did this as well (the little hooks coming out of his fingers).  Unlike the original film though, peter parker climbs walls and hangs from ceilings while wearing athletic shoes.  It sounds nitpicky but that's the price of getting into the details.  Given the rules of the world that has been defined, there is no explanation for this.  In fact, everything about Spiderman's costume, technology, and abilities appears less plausible than in the original film.  No explanation whatsoever is given for how he acquired all the things he has (not all of his own invention I might add).  Perhaps the choice to treat this more seriously backfired?  Beyond technological nitpicking is the highly implausible turn of events near the end of the film that would require hours of planning by heroic construction workers, but occur within a matter of minutes.  Even worse than the impossibility of it all is the sheer corniness of the groan inducing attempt at depicting the heroic ""everyman"" coming to the aid of our hero; something pulled off brilliantly in the first two Spiderman films.SUCCEEDING ON ITS OWNFor the most part, I enjoyed this film until plausibility fell off a cliff near the end.  All those technological contradictions and omissions could be overlooked.  The action was pretty fun thanks to the new age of visual fix.  Many criticize the Lizard which is understandable, though it really didn't bother me.  The pacing was a bit slow but I never complain about good character development.  Next to the story, character development is most important in my mind.  These characters are well enough developed with the possible exception of Sally Field's Aunt May who seemed a lot like Sally Field to me.  Martin Sheen's ""Uncle Ben"" was great to me.  He made a great impression on Peter without spewing ""quote-able"" lines from the comics.  Denis Leary as the police chief was a great and likable character.  I enjoyed Peter's argument over dinner with him. Who is the better Peter Parker is strictly a matter of taste as both versions are fine.  If it seems like I'm stretching for compliments, your right.  Actually, my favorite thing about this movie was Stan Lee's obligatory cameo; the best ever!  That's not saying much.WITH GREAT BUDGET COMES GREAT ....No need to finish that line eh?  Clearly, my ultimate verdict is that this film didn't need to get made.  We have a perfectly awesome origin of Spiderman movie already.  Though not as true to the comics in story as this film, it does a better job of capturing the spirit of the comic.  I'd have rather seen an attempt at bringing another character to life than a re-hashing of something that wasn't broken.  If the goal was a more realistic and plausible story, then this film failed to deliver.  If the goal was to capture a more accurate telling of the original comic, then it has succeeded while missing the mark on entertainment value.  It seems like a lot of time, money, and effort for nothing.  How about another attempt at getting the Hulk right?  Well, maybe not.Acting........4 starsStory.........3 starsCharacter.....3.5 starsEntertainment...3 starsAverage....3.25 stars",3,By Web or Wall; Was This Trip Necessary?,1344988800,"08 15,

I'm guessing my primary beef with it is that we've no longer got Tobey Maguire as the lead. I became so attached to the cast from the other three films that I had a tough time accepting any other face behind the mask (not to mention, my heart sank when I discovered that John Malkovich would've had a central role in Spiderman 4). Now, I've been told that Andrew Garfield's take on Spidey was a lot more true to the awkward nature of comic-book Spiderman. In that regard, he nailed the Peter Parker personality dead-on. Unfortunately, mega-awkward Spidey just isn't all that likable. Garfield's Spiderman was a stuttery pretty boy who could barely speak, let alone conjure the illusion that there was any depth whatsoever to his personality. At times I was genuinely puzzled by how god-awful his acting was coming across. If not for the adorable charm of Emma Stone's Gwen Stacy, or the occasionally interesting antics of Dr. Connors, a one-star rating would probably be more fitting.

1417674,A27OBJA1YDQFZI,B004LWZWFQ,"E. M. Bristol ""bibliophile""","[6, 12]","The movie begins with a flashback of the very young Peter Parker playing hide-and-seek with his parents, who are soon whisked off on a mysterious scientific quest for reasons he isn't privy to, but are guaranteed to cause angst once he turns into a teenager, played by Andrew Garfield. Parker's mentor, Curt Connors, (Rhys Ifans) is a friend of Peter's dad, employee of Oscorp, who has been researching inter-species limb regeneration for years, and who winds up experimenting on himself (he's an amputee) using a formula Peter comes up with.  This transforms him into a cross between a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle and the Incredible Hulk.  He decides that humans are hopelessly flawed and goes to brood in the sewers of Gotham, where he twirls his mustache a lot and plots nefarious deeds, to be foiled by Spider Man, who feels guilt for helping create this monster.  Also, as his Uncle Ben (Martin Sheen) reminds him in slightly different words, ""With great power comes great responsibility.""Bearing a disconcerting resemblance to Hilary Duff, Emma Stone plays Peter's love interest, Gwen Stacy, daughter of head NYPD (Denis Leary), and fellow science devotee, around whom he's tongue-tied but does manage to share his big secret.  She helps save the world in knee-length boots and very short skirts, as her dad attempts to corral both Spider-Man and the Lizard.  Garfield (""The Social Network,"" ""Never Let Me Go"") is a little too handsome to convince as a high school outcast, but he is believable as both a shy guy who's ""passionate about science,"" and a cocky superhero enjoying his newfound powers.The special effects deliver, although I'm the type of viewer who keeps thinking of alternate ways the hero can defeat the villian a whole lot faster than he's currently doing on screen.  There are moments of genuine sweetness between the characters, but like with most action thrillers, they are few and far between. The new ""Spider-Man"" is noticeably different from the Tobey Maguire version, so don't go in expecting identical character names, characters or even trademark quotes.

As fans, everyone should know that there are many, many Spider-Man tales. Spider-Man Noir, Spider-Man 2099, Ultimate Spider-Man. Should I go on? This isn't an attempt to ignore the fun of the previous films. Instead, they are just using the opportunity to highlight different aspects of the characters, and the stories.Case in point - the most hotly debated item of the ""mystery"" of Peter Parker's family. Yeah, in the theatre it seemed a mis-step. But in the commentary (see, I bought the BD and watched it prior to the review. End rant) they actually come out and say certain plot points were meant to be fully addressed in a future film. Knowing this, I actually enjoyed the film much more through the second viewing.And speaking of the commentary, we actually get a few great nuggets of the thoughts behind the movie, the casting (apparently Emma Stone and Denis Leary were cast due to physical appearances, or at least it is joked about), the costuming, everything. And none of it is double-tapped in the extensive battery of behind-the-scenes on Disc Two. Remember when Special Editions of DVD had the second disc for all the extra material? Well, this BD release is a step back into that direction. We've got a tonne of treats on that 2nd BD, including like 18 different language tracks.

1417684,A3D3DJKKMLCRYZ,B004LWZWFQ,"Erin ""skyblueboy""","[2, 4]","The movie seemed fairly promising to start. It introduced a new element into the origin of Spiderman, diving into what happened to Peter's parents. But even this could have been done without having to re-explore the other parts of his origin. We already are versed on how he became Spiderman. Instead of retreading it, they could have found another way to introduce these new elements.But the retelling of the origin isn't the real problem with this movie. It's the interpretation of Spiderman and Peter Parker. I saw Andrew Garfield in The Imaginarium of Dr Parnassus and felt he was a decent actor who could play the part well. I was wrong.Don't misunderstand, he acts the part well. It's his characterization that I find reprehensible and I think a large part of it has to do with who he is personally transferring into his performance.It's been awhile since I've watched the Toby Maguire films, so I may not be remembering things exactly. But I recall that, even though he played the character as being a nerdy outcast, it was done so with a certain calm knowing. He knew he was different, but he was an outcast because he was something better than what was around him. He found joy in it.Here, Garfield is the typical whiny, dysfunctional loser who feels that way because it's ""hip"" to be that way, not necessarily due to life making him that way. Worse, at times he comes off glorifying the typical cocky thug gangster rap culture that so many people like, even though that's the cause of most of society's problems these days.It's as though Chris Brown donned Spidey's outfit and played at being something he can never be, a hero. Instead of rescuing the girl, he'd beat her near to death. Instead of facing great odds in battle, he would back down like a coward even if he had The Hulk and X-Men backing him up. We would see him as the villain he is, pretending to be a hero.Yo yo yo, Garfield, playah! I don't want to hear Spiderman talking like that. I don't want to hear YOU talking like that. Stop being a typical White nerd finding something good in a culture that is so awful.Even if you remove this portrayal from the role, there's still not much about the movie that's inspiring. Towards the end, Spiderman has to get to The Lizard (who looks like plastic) to save the day. The scene is set up to show how ordinary people will pull together to help Spidey achieve this, but it just comes out being laughable in a sad way.In fact, the movie has too many of those occurrences . There's one in particular that involves a rat that's so, pardon the pun... cheesy you have to wonder how they thought it would be anything but.There are parts that are great, such as Martin Sheen's portrayal as Uncle Ben. But he has a lot of experience playing the part of a father who has a self destructing son in real life that he's able to bring that to the role.But as a whole, this movie fails too often to make you want to see what the second one brings.

1417688,A36NMMVWY6BP1V,B004LWZWFQ,evani1997,"[0, 0]","Despite my slightly young age, I was one of the many who grew up watching the Raimi Spider-Man films. Despite the third getting mixed reception, the other two were very well received and could be considered modern classics. So naturally I was disappointed when I learned that they were rebooting the franchise. Marvel's second take, called The Amazing Spider-Man, is a darker incarnation of the beloved comics. So those who haven't seen the film are wondering: does this film do the old webhead justice?Well... you've probably already figured out what I think due to the rating I gave it. Still, I'm going to go into the film in detail to offer my pros and cons.Spider-Man's origin story, like Batman Begins and Man of Steel, is very much the same as that of the comics, with some slight alterations. Yes, he gets bit by a radioactive spider. Yes, Uncle Ben dies. Yes, there is great power and great responsibility (although this movie kind of paraphrases it). However, there are certain things that are different about it. I'm not going to say what to avoid spoilers. Just know that it is mostly the same origin. This is the only thing that I'm not too big a fan of. It seems like certain differences they have in the origin are only different because Marvel wants to avoid being too much like the Raimi films. However, the changes are outweighed by the extra depth put into the origins of how he became a superhero.The rest of the story, however, stands out magnificently. The villain, who in this film is the Lizard, actually plays a vital role in this film, as opposed to the Green Goblin who was just in because the film needed a villain. Don't get me wrong- I love the Willem Defoe Goblin. I'm just saying that the Lizard was key to his origin and the plot. This film also explores the story of Peter Parker's parents, which was ignored in the Raimi films. Unfortunately, this plot isn't resolved in this film. Hopefully, The Amazing Spider-Man 2 will clear things up more.The characters are excellent. Andrew Garfield is a near perfect Peter Parker and Spider-Man. This Spidey is actually a wisecraker, as opposed to the Tobey Maguire one. Rhys Ifans is a great Dr. Connors and much easier to see being the Lizard than the previous one. Emma Stone's Gwen Stacy is more interesting than Mary Jane and actually does important stuff in the film. Dennis Leary was a huge improvement over the last Captain Stacy, and this time, he's actually cool. The acting is very good. I think this one portrays teenagers more accurately than the Raimi ones. Oh, and I would just like to say that Martin Sheen is a super awesome (and funny) Uncle Ben.The action is also more interesting in this one, which is saying something since the Raimi films had some pretty great action. It gets very intense, and sometimes a little graphic. But this version also shows that Spider-Man doesn't start out perfect. As you watch the film, you see that Spider-Man's fighting style was rather sloppy, but by the end of it, he fights in his usual kung fu-like style. One thing I liked in particular was that Spider-Man does more things like a spider. He does things like crawl around the Lizard while entangling him in webs, which I have to say was really cool.When it comes down to it, I'd have to say that I liked The Amazing Spider-Man more than the Raimi Spider-Man. The story is more interesting, the acting and characters are better, and the action's great. However, please note that these are my opinions. I understand if you like the Raimi Spider-Man better.This film has gotten me excited for more, and I anticipate the next one coming out this year!Final Score: 9/10",5,Spidey's Back and Better than Ever!,1388620800,"01 2, 2014",2014,3649,"['slightly', 'young', 'age', 'was', 'one', 'many', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'watching', 'Raimi', 'Spider-Man', 'films', 'third', 'getting', 'mixed', 'reception', 'other', 'two', 'were', 'very', 'well', 'received', 'could', 'be', 'considered', 'modern', 'classics', 'naturally', 'was', 'disappointed', 'when', 'learned', 'were', 'rebooting', 'franchise', 'Marvel', 'second', 'take', 'called', 'Amazing', 'Spider-Man', 'darker', 'incarnation', 'beloved', 'comics', 'So', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'film', 'are', 'wondering', 'film', 'do', 'old', 'webhead', 'justice', 'Well', ""'ve"", 'probably', 'already', 'figured', 'out', 'what', 'think', 'due', 'rating', 'gave', 'Still', ""'m"", 'going', 'go', 'film', 'detail', 'offer', 'pros', 'cons.Spider-Man', 'origin', 'story', 'Batman', 'Begins', 'Man', 'Steel', 'very', 'much', 'same', 'comics', 'slight', 'alterations', 'Yes', 'bit', 'radioactive', 'spider', 'Yes', 'Uncle', 'Ben', 'Yes', 'great', 'power', 'great', 'responsibility', 'movie', 'kind', 'paraphrases', 'However', 'are', 'certain', 'things', 'are', 'different', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'say', 'what', 'avoid', 'spoilers', 'Just', 'know', 'mostly', 'same', 'origin', 'only', 'thing', ""'m"", 'not', 'too', 'big', 'fan', 'certain', 'differences', 'have', 'origin', 'are', 'only', 'different', 'Marvel', 'avoid', 'being', 'too', 'much', 'Raimi', 'films', 'However', 'changes', 'are', 'outweighed', 'extra', 'depth', 'put', 'origins', 'how', 'became', 'superhero.The', 'rest', 'story', 'however', 'out', 'magnificently', 'villain', 'who', 'film', 'Lizard', 'actually', 'vital', 'role', 'film', 'opposed', 'Green', 'Goblin', 'who', 'was', 'just', 'film', 'needed', 'villain', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong-', 'love', 'Willem', 'Defoe', 'Goblin', ""'m"", 'just', 'saying', 'Lizard', 'was', 'key', 'origin', 'plot', 'film', 'also', 'story', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'parents', 'was', 'ignored', 'Raimi', 'films', 'Unfortunately', 'plot', ""n't"", 'resolved', 'film', 'Hopefully', 'Amazing', 'Spider-Man', '2', 'will', 'clear', 'things', 'up', 'more.The', 'characters', 'are', 'excellent', 'Andrew', 'Garfield', 'near', 'perfect', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'Spider-Man', 'Spidey', 'actually', 'wisecraker', 'opposed', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'one', 'Rhys', 'Ifans', 'great', 'Dr.', 'Connors', 'much', 'easier', 'see', 'being', 'Lizard', 'previous', 'one', 'Emma', 'Stone', 'Gwen', 'Stacy', 'more', 'interesting', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'actually', 'important', 'stuff', 'film', 'Dennis', 'Leary', 'was', 'huge', 'improvement', 'last', 'Captain', 'Stacy', 'time', 'actually', 'cool', 'acting', 'very', 'good', 'think', 'one', 'teenagers', 'more', 'accurately', 'Raimi', 'ones', 'Oh', 'would', 'just', 'like', 'say', 'Martin', 'Sheen', 'super', 'awesome', 'funny', 'Uncle', 'Ben.The', 'action', 'also', 'more', 'interesting', 'one', 'saying', 'something', 'Raimi', 'films', 'had', 'pretty', 'great', 'action', 'very', 'intense', 'sometimes', 'little', 'graphic', 'version', 'also', 'Spider-Man', ""n't"", 'start', 'out', 'perfect', 'watch', 'film', 'see', 'Spider-Man', 'fighting', 'style', 'was', 'rather', 'sloppy', 'end', 'usual', 'kung', 'fu-like', 'style', 'One', 'thing', 'liked', 'particular', 'was', 'Spider-Man', 'more', 'things', 'spider', 'things', 'crawl', 'Lizard', 'entangling', 'webs', 'have', 'say', 'was', 'really', 'cool.When', 'down', ""'d"", 'have', 'say', 'liked', 'Amazing', 'Spider-Man', 'more', 'Raimi', 'Spider-Man', 'story', 'more', 'interesting', 'acting', 'characters', 'are', 'better', 'action', 'great', 'However', 'please', 'note', 'are', 'opinions', 'understand', 'like', 'Raimi', 'Spider-Man', 'better.This', 'film', 'gotten', 'excited', 'more', 'anticipate', 'next', 'one', 'coming', 'out', 'year', 'Final', 'Score', '9/10']",The Amazing Spider-Man

1417702,A1U6XPYATU9OPG,B004LWZWFQ,G. Denick,"[0, 0]","Sam Raimi's take on Spider-Man (released in 2001, I believe) is one of my very favorite comic book movies. The reason being, it's funny, and also, quite simply FUN. I was a bit apprehensive that any reboot could live up to the high standards established by that rather goofy movie, but this new Spider-Man does an admirable job. It is nowhere near as much fun, in my opinion, but it has found its own voice, one by which it holds its own ground and succeeds.Rather than try to emulate the feel-good vibe of Raimi's flick, ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" goes in the opposite direction, creating a more sophisticated, mature, and darker adaptation. I actually got the impression that the director and cinematographer must be avid students of ""Batman Begins"" (another great superhero flick), as I was constantly reminded of that bleaker imagery and emotional themes.I don't think that the actor Garfield holds a candle to Maguire's performance as the iconic hero, but I don't know that anybody could. To his credit, Garfield doesn't try to emulate Maguire, but rather to create his own, moodier Spider-Man (although it doesn't quite feel like the classic web-head, without the freewheeling insults and good humor). As for the Lizard, he is a fantastic villain, channeling the very best parts of the Banner/Hulk psyche, at once creating empathy for his character, and fear for his unfocused power and unraveling stability.Though ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" is not quite on par with Sam Raimi's masterful take on the web slinger, it's still a very good superhero movie. It's major fault, in my humble opinion, is that it takes itself a shade too seriously for a movie about a character who is so thoroughly in love with the concept of fun.",4,A worthy reboot of the legacy established by Sam Raimi and Tobey Maguire,1353888000,"11 26, 2012",2012,1725,"['Sam', 'Raimi', 'take', 'Spider-Man', 'released', '2001', 'believe', 'one', 'very', 'favorite', 'comic', 'book', 'movies', 'reason', 'being', 'funny', 'also', 'quite', 'simply', 'FUN', 'was', 'bit', 'apprehensive', 'reboot', 'could', 'live', 'up', 'high', 'standards', 'established', 'rather', 'goofy', 'movie', 'new', 'Spider-Man', 'admirable', 'job', 'nowhere', 'near', 'much', 'fun', 'opinion', 'found', 'own', 'voice', 'one', 'own', 'ground', 'succeeds.Rather', 'try', 'emulate', 'feel-good', 'vibe', 'Raimi', 'flick', 'Amazing', 'Spider-Man', 'opposite', 'direction', 'creating', 'more', 'sophisticated', 'mature', 'darker', 'adaptation', 'actually', 'got', 'impression', 'director', 'cinematographer', 'must', 'be', 'avid', 'students', 'Batman', 'Begins', 'great', 'superhero', 'flick', 'was', 'constantly', 'reminded', 'bleaker', 'imagery', 'emotional', 'themes.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'actor', 'Garfield', 'candle', 'Maguire', 'performance', 'iconic', 'hero', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'anybody', 'could', 'credit', 'Garfield', ""n't"", 'try', 'emulate', 'Maguire', 'rather', 'create', 'own', 'moodier', 'Spider-Man', ""n't"", 'quite', 'feel', 'classic', 'web-head', 'freewheeling', 'insults', 'good', 'humor', 'Lizard', 'fantastic', 'villain', 'channeling', 'very', 'best', 'parts', 'Banner/Hulk', 'psyche', 'once', 'creating', 'empathy', 'character', 'fear', 'unfocused', 'power', 'unraveling', 'stability.Though', 'Amazing', 'Spider-Man', 'not', 'quite', 'par', 'Sam', 'Raimi', 'masterful', 'take', 'web', 'slinger', 'still', 'very', 'good', 'superhero', 'movie', 'major', 'fault', 'humble', 'opinion', 'shade', 'too', 'seriously', 'movie', 'character', 'who', 'so', 'thoroughly', 'love', 'concept', 'fun']",The Amazing Spider-Man

Though, there is considerably more humor than what the trailers suggest and overall it does a pretty good job at characterization while delivering a world that is more realistic than the previous Spiderman movie.So, compared to the previous spiderman movie, I like this one more. Granted, I wasn't the biggest fan of the previous trilogy and only watched it once, barely remembering really what happened, but still, there's something about this one that's more real, and so more fantastic, than the previous spiderman.Of course, since this is a Hollywood movie, the end of the movie ends up being kind of stupid, with lots of guys jumping around and murdering each other.

In those 2 movies, I felt like I *was* Spider-man during the movie.  With this Garfield version, becauseof the lack of emotional connection, frankly I didn't care a whole lot what happened to the main character, so it it really killed any sense of suspense or excitement during the movie.Storyline was ok, but again I thought the Tobey Maguire Spider-man movie #1 was far superior in the way that it showed Spider-man coming into being.With the entire movie, it seemed like a fairly distant, dispassionate, disconnected treatment of Spider-man. And on this level, I thought it was an epic fail.

1417718,A328S9RN3U5M68,B004LWZWFQ,Grady Harp,"[1, 1]","Why we needed another Spiderman series after the recent (2002/2007) Tobey McGuire run is probably the same reason we keep getting remakes of foreign films (Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, etc): they make money.  And it looks like the public will never tire of Marvel Comic Book stories, so might as well settle in and give them a try. It is an evening's entertainment approaching 3 hours of visual shenanigans that are pretty entertaining.There are some differences between this Spiderman and the last - aside from cast: the stories are different although they both claim to show the origin of this magic transformation of a lonely confused young man trying to figure out who he is until he discovers some super secrets and the power to change into a humanoid spider-gifted hero. It all starts out well enough - Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) is shy and unable to relate to about everyone except his aunt and uncle (Sally Field and Martin Sheen do a fine job here). He fails at a run-in with the high school bully Flash (a hunky and promising Chris Zylka), is noticed by the perky Gwen (Emma Stone) who is involved in Peter's introduction to scientist Dr. Curt Connors (Rhys Ifans) who is an old friend of Peter's strangely disappeared father (Campbell Scott) and mother (Embeth Davidtz). Peter is smart, discovers a formula in his father's briefcase, and ultimately is able to transform himself into Spiderman - his nemesis being The Lizard who is actually Dr. Connors taking a potent experimental solution.  After a lot of flying around on buildings and throwing spider web tendrils at everything including The Lizard, Peter is hunted as a threat until Gwen's policeman father (Denis Leary) eventually bonds with the insecure Peter in a life saving situation. Then we are given footage of what is up for the sequel...The human  (read `credible') parts work the best - Garfield and Stone make a fine pair and Sheen and Field give fine cameos.  Once the transformation takes place the film becomes a lesson in special effects and that is fun enough to watch.  It just goes on far too long...and there is more to come.

Every character is a cardboard cut out placed in the wrong light, the lizard is just a compromise of goblin and doc oc.Just lame... earlier parker throws a football 70 yards and it bends the goal posts, but later when he throws his shoe at the lizard from about 20 feet the shoe bounces off as though a 3-4 year old child threw it, having absolutely no effect on the lizard.And like all superhero movies, the characters rather than having their own lives, are all subservient to some giant corporation, like oscorp or doom corp or weyland enterprises etc...Giant corporations are the evil of the day, hey just throw on your spidey mask on some stupid little kid and save the day. In the comic he designs his own web formula, in this he steals it and makes web shooters from an old watch to use it for his own purposes.I got sick of it and had to shut it off before the big climax or whatever happens at the end.

1417736,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B004LWZWFQ,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[4, 11]","And because not a lot of people clamored for it, here's THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN, director Marc Webb's sort of unnecessary reboot of Sam Raimi's wallcrawler film franchise. Sam Raimi's falling out with Sony left a lingering bad taste, and so, going in, I wasn't too keen about this one. Still, Spidey's my favorite superhero and I couldn't pass it up.First impressions, stepping out the theater: Director Marc Webb had big shoes to fill, and I think he successfully establishes a Spidey universe that is grittier and rougher 'round the edges and yet allows space for the occasional forays into humor. Much of this is personified in Garfield's Peter Parker. I had never heard of Garfield - apparently, he's half-Brit, half-Yankee - but his interpretation of Peter is more on point than Maguire's. Garfield's Peter sounds more like a chatty guy from Queens than Maguire's version ever did. And while he channels Maguire's angsty demeanor, Andrew Garfield injects bravado into his character, or you can call it moxie or even jackassery. It's New Yawk, baby.THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN is gratifying in several ways and, specifically, in three ways. Spidey's mechanical webshooters are back. This is cool on two fronts: 1) because Maguire's organic webs have always seemed creepy to me, and 2) Peter's inventing the webshooters accentuates his brilliant knack for science. It's only been five years since the awful third Spidey picture, but CG technology has advanced even further. Spider-Man today is uncanny in how he moves and fights and poses. There are several dynamic poses he strikes in mid-swing that mimic Todd McFarlane's covers. Lastly, this Spidey is a nonstop wiseacre, exactly like how he is in the comics, exactly NOT like Tobey Maguire played him. At times Spidey's one-liners come off like the sort of snark indulged by that annoying, anonymous punk heckler hiding in the back. You can see why Spidey's jokes persistently get under his opponent's skin. Garfield's delivery is perfect. I wouldn't have minded another half hour of his thrashing (and insulting) a series of petty carjackers.This reboot tweaks Spidey's mythology some. Instead of my telling you what the changes are, let me tell you what's not here. Spidey doesn't get to have that short-lived wrestling career, and, if you're down with Spidey's history, then you can figure out how that impacts his origin. There's no irradiated arachnid to bite our guy. No sighting of Mary Jane Watson or J. Jonah Jameson. And no one solemnly remarking: ""With great power must also come great responsibility."" Stan Lee is here, making his standard cameo.One of my concerns was that the film had promised to explore the mystery behind Peter's parents' deaths. And it's true that his parents, in a tangible way, point Peter towards his crimefighting path. But the focus on the 'rents isn't as pronounced as I'd feared. But, yeah, their absence is keenly felt by their orphaned son. Note that this Peter Parker, while still a bullied nerd, exudes plenty of attitude. He's got a pretty sizable chip on his shoulder.I love Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy, who in the comics is Peter's first true love (she preceded Mary Jane Watson). Already regarded as a hot up-and-comer, Stone's Gwen is no wilting damsel in distress. She's smart and supportive and contributes. I do wish that the film had better established how someone like Gwen could fall for a gawky, uneasy outcast like Peter. Stone and Garfield are so good in their scenes together that, at times, I forgot I was watching a superhero genre film; there are moments that feel like I'm in the middle of an indie romantic comedy. The awkward flirtation elicits big smiles. Gwen's hilarious hallway dialogue with her dad is priceless.While entertaining as hells, this film isn't perfect. The plot doesn't feel organic. It's plagued by too many coincidences (Gwen's interning at Oscorp, one of the more glaring ones). And while I understand the suits' wanting to ensure that the lead's face gets full exposure, It's kinda ridiculous that Spidey would get unmasked on several occasions (okay, one of those times he voluntarily takes the mask off himself). And you know that old saw about how a hero is only as good as his villain? This villain is uncompelling. I don't know how much my aversion towards the Lizard is due to my not once ever liking him in the comics. But while Rhys Ifans knocked me for a loop by submitting a low-keyed performance, the moment he transforms into the marauding 9-foot-tall Lizard, his predictable villain motivation sunk it for me. Alfred Molina did the tortured big bad already, and better. I just lauded the CG work done on Spidey, so imagine the sheepishness when I say that the shaky CG rendering of the Lizard consistently took me out of the story. I wish those labcoat tatters had stayed on him. Maybe I would've bought it more.Ultimately, this one's high on watchability but isn't as good as the first SPIDER-MAN movie or the superb SPIDER-MAN 2. But, if you're a Spidey fan, I think this reboot is very much worth a visit to your local movie theater (but skip the 3D). It's too bad that THE AVENGERS and THE DARK KNIGHT RISES are bogarting the spotlight. Else, THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN would be raking in even more green. As it is, it's viewed more as the spoiled meat in this summer's superhero cinematic sandwich. But see it anyway, for Garfield and Stone's performances and chemistry, and for Martin Sheen's turn as the wise and doomed Uncle Ben, and Denis Leary's no-nonsense take on NYPD Captain Stacy (who channels J. Jonah Jameson in labeling Spidey a menace). See this for a more dynamic Spidey and a more mouthy Spidey. It's nice to see the Queens come out of our friendly neighborhood webslinger.You can stick around for the mid-credits scene. It's as vague as it is uninformative.",4,"""Hey, watch out!

Collier ""Bill & Holly""","[1, 2]","Well as a golden age comic fan and growing up reading the original spider man comics as a boy I was happy to see the first spider man movie hit the screens but I had a couple problems with it but overall a great portrayal of the superhero Spider-Man and loved old Toby in them, even liked the third one even though it could have been better... Fast forward to The Amazing Spider-Man and its 2013 and I waited until now to finally watch it because I didn't see the need to go back to Spider-Man's beginning story and the first movie had a better portrayed uncle Bens death story.. But it wasn't too big a difference to lower my opinion of The Amazing Spider-Man but the one thing above all else they got right the Toby movies didn't was that Spider-Man did not hoot webs from within his arms and the who,e thing with the two fingered pressed into the palms thing had a reason which is that Peter Parker made web shooting gadgets that used capsules and a pressure plate under his gloves to activate the shooting of the webs and this movie definitely got that right and is more accurate to true Spider-Man origins and his powers so great job on that but I also love the way the web capsules were explained in the movie as several hundred yards could be contained in a small capsule and that was greatly explained in this movie as well... Now that I watched it I'm going too order the four disc set as it definitely has a place in our massive DVD/BluRay collection of over 1500 titles and I just ordered a brand new 3D LED/LCD TV in a 50&#34; inch size so the TV will be here the day before the 3D combo set gets here so ill get back to you on the 3D version and now I am hoping they do make a sequel to the Amazing Spider-Man and if there is we won't wait until later to buy and watch it because we very much enjoyed this reselling of a classic super hero character, we still love the original movies too and they are each great in their own right",5,Well I put off watching this for long enough,1362268800,"03 3, 2013",2013,1944,"['Well', 'golden', 'age', 'comic', 'fan', 'growing', 'up', 'reading', 'original', 'spider', 'man', 'comics', 'boy', 'was', 'happy', 'see', 'first', 'spider', 'man', 'movie', 'hit', 'screens', 'had', 'couple', 'problems', 'great', 'portrayal', 'superhero', 'Spider-Man', 'loved', 'old', 'Toby', 'even', 'liked', 'third', 'one', 'even', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'Fast', 'forward', 'Amazing', 'Spider-Man', '2013', 'waited', 'now', 'finally', 'watch', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'need', 'go', 'back', 'Spider-Man', 'beginning', 'story', 'first', 'movie', 'had', 'better', 'portrayed', 'uncle', 'Bens', 'death', 'story..', 'was', ""n't"", 'too', 'big', 'difference', 'lower', 'opinion', 'Amazing', 'Spider-Man', 'one', 'thing', 'else', 'got', 'right', 'Toby', 'movies', 'did', ""n't"", 'was', 'Spider-Man', 'did', 'not', 'hoot', 'webs', 'arms', 'who', 'thing', 'two', 'fingered', 'pressed', 'palms', 'thing', 'had', 'reason', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'made', 'web', 'shooting', 'gadgets', 'used', 'capsules', 'pressure', 'plate', 'gloves', 'activate', 'shooting', 'webs', 'movie', 'definitely', 'got', 'right', 'more', 'accurate', 'true', 'Spider-Man', 'origins', 'powers', 'so', 'great', 'job', 'also', 'love', 'way', 'web', 'capsules', 'were', 'explained', 'movie', 'several', 'hundred', 'yards', 'could', 'be', 'contained', 'small', 'capsule', 'was', 'greatly', 'explained', 'movie', 'as', 'well', 'Now', 'watched', ""'m"", 'going', 'too', 'order', 'four', 'disc', 'set', 'definitely', 'place', 'massive', 'DVD/BluRay', 'collection', '1500', 'titles', 'just', 'ordered', 'brand', 'new', '3D', 'LED/LCD', 'TV', '50', '34', 'inch', 'size', 'TV', 'will', 'be', 'here', 'day', '3D', 'combo', 'set', 'here', 'so', 'ill', 'get', 'back', '3D', 'version', 'now', 'am', 'hoping', 'do', 'make', 'sequel', 'Amazing', 'Spider-Man', 'wo', ""n't"", 'wait', 'later', 'buy', 'watch', 'very', 'much', 'enjoyed', 'reselling', 'classic', 'super', 'hero', 'character', 'still', 'love', 'original', 'movies', 'too', 'are', 'great', 'own', 'right']",The Amazing Spider-Man

Truthfully, in my own opinion, at least comparing the first Tobey Maguire film and then this film, I enjoyed them both probably about equally as well.  I favor this one maybe a small bit more considering that Marvel Studios was actually behind it and it was perhaps maybe a little bit more intuned with the comics, but beyond that I honestly enjoyed both renditions close to about as much.  We'll see what happens when they release another Amazing Spiderman film down the line, but as for now that's how I view it.  Andrew Garfield and Tobey Maguire both play nerd well and pulled off this role fantastically I thought, and the cast in both were great.  It was kind of refreshing to see Sally Field again, in her role as Aunt May...I don't remember having seen her in a good movie in a while, (I'm sure she's been in some stuff overtime, but just stuff maybe I hadn't seen), and I also rather enjoyed Martin Sheen as Uncle Ben, Emma Stone as Gwen Stacey, Dennis Leary as the police commisioner/Gwen Stacey's father, and Rhys Ifans as Dr. Connors.  Great performances all!  If you're a fan of Marvel, or comic book movies in general like myself...or you just like a good entertaining movie, then I highly recommend checking out The Amazing Spiderman!  It's great!

Great film making, great actors and more true to the comic-book storyline, it stepped up the Spider-man franchise. I'll admit that I was really annoyed when I saw the trailer because it was like, ""Wow... running out of ideas..."" But now that I've seen the movie, it's quite the excellent movie. Everyone put a lot of care into it.However, everything usually has Pros and Cons, so, here they are:PROS:-Excellent lighting, set design and directing.-Engaging characters and story.-Great acting!-The return of the more comic book-like Spider-man. Spidey's cheesy jokes have returned! I would say this Peter Parker balances his serious and his comedic side very well.CONS:-There was that part of the movie that was near literal dues ex machina. However, I'll admit it looked epic with Spider-man swinging across cranes...-The villain's motivation, although clear, didn't feel fully realized. The movie watcher hears him say, ""I can cure human-kind!"" but they never see the passion for the rest of the world before that statement, as he mainly has been working for himself and his own desire.-Also with the villain, it seemed odd that all of a sudden, he hears voices like Norman Osborne like in the other movies.

1417752,A3NMTMK5Z5VJDL,B004LWZWFQ,"H. Tague ""nerd""","[2, 4]","I'll keep it short and sweet. One could debate endlessly about having a reboot so soon after the last live-action Spidey series ran its course, but it happened and it really shouldn't matter.As far as the film itself, it's a good super hero film. Not as good as Ironman or Captain America (need one even mention The Avengers?), but it doesn't fall nearly as flat as other films have (Catwoman, Daredevil, etc...). It's well shot, the story and characters are interesting, and all of the roles are performed quite well. In fact, in terms of plot I would say that this film exceeds the original in terms of depth. Ma and Pa Parker are actually worked into the plot, connecting them to Kurt Connors and even Oscorp. And it even has some interesting threads to lead into future installments.Other matters are more variable based on preferrence. Half the film is about Gwen Stacy and her relationship to Peter Parker. If you aren't a fan of High School romance, you won't like that half of the film. Also, rather than being a nerd, this Peter Parker is a skater boy (straight out of Avril Lavine's song), which may be a turn-off. Also, the web-shooters make their return and are even functionally worked into the plot (showing how adaptable Peter must be when they are rendered inert).The only thing that was removed that I didn't care for personally was the famous line; ""with great power, comes great responsibility."" This phrase, typically uttered by Uncle Ben, is a corner stone for Peter's entire development as a character, and it is omitted from the film. Granted, Peter learns this lesson more or less on his own, but lacking the actual line, and the source from whence it comes, feels like a blow to the character. That could just be the fan-boy in me talking, but it's Spidey's slogan. It seemed like they were going to slip it in, in the end, but they didn't.All-in-all, a good film, and a good Spidey film. If nothing else, it does look to be building on something much bigger. In the long run, I have no doubt that the new series will outshine the original.",4,A simple review for the open-minded.,1373328000,"07 9, 2013",2013,2065,"[""'ll"", 'keep', 'short', 'sweet', 'One', 'could', 'debate', 'endlessly', 'having', 'reboot', 'so', 'soon', 'last', 'live-action', 'Spidey', 'series', 'ran', 'course', 'happened', 'really', 'should', ""n't"", 'matter.As', 'far', 'film', 'good', 'super', 'hero', 'film', 'Not', 'as', 'good', 'Ironman', 'Captain', 'America', 'need', 'one', 'even', 'mention', 'Avengers', ""n't"", 'fall', 'nearly', 'as', 'flat', 'other', 'films', 'have', 'Catwoman', 'Daredevil', 'etc', 'well', 'shot', 'story', 'characters', 'are', 'interesting', 'roles', 'are', 'performed', 'quite', 'well', 'fact', 'terms', 'plot', 'would', 'say', 'film', 'original', 'terms', 'depth', 'Ma', 'Pa', 'Parker', 'are', 'actually', 'worked', 'plot', 'connecting', 'Kurt', 'Connors', 'even', 'Oscorp', 'even', 'interesting', 'threads', 'lead', 'future', 'installments.Other', 'matters', 'are', 'more', 'variable', 'based', 'preferrence', 'film', 'Gwen', 'Stacy', 'relationship', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'are', ""n't"", 'fan', 'High', 'School', 'romance', 'wo', ""n't"", 'like', 'half', 'film', 'Also', 'rather', 'being', 'nerd', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'skater', 'boy', 'straight', 'Avril', 'Lavine', 'song', 'may', 'be', 'turn-off', 'Also', 'web-shooters', 'make', 'return', 'are', 'even', 'functionally', 'worked', 'plot', 'showing', 'how', 'adaptable', 'Peter', 'must', 'be', 'when', 'are', 'rendered', 'inert', 'only', 'thing', 'was', 'removed', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'personally', 'was', 'famous', 'line', 'great', 'power', 'great', 'responsibility', 'phrase', 'typically', 'uttered', 'Uncle', 'Ben', 'corner', 'stone', 'Peter', 'entire', 'development', 'character', 'omitted', 'film', 'Granted', 'Peter', 'lesson', 'more', 'less', 'own', 'lacking', 'actual', 'line', 'source', 'whence', 'feels', 'blow', 'character', 'could', 'just', 'be', 'fan-boy', 'talking', 'Spidey', 'slogan', 'seemed', 'were', 'going', 'slip', 'end', ""didn't.All-in-all"", 'good', 'film', 'good', 'Spidey', 'film', 'nothing', 'else', 'look', 'be', 'building', 'something', 'much', 'bigger', 'long', 'run', 'have', 'doubt', 'new', 'series', 'will', 'outshine', 'original']",The Amazing Spider-Man

1417755,A2ICW5OUWX2A2V,B004LWZWFQ,Ian,"[22, 38]","Why?That was the thought that hounded over me during the entire development of Sony's reboot of the live action trilogy that had grossed enough money to fill up Central Park several times over, and had been critically acclaimed as one of the best superhero film trilogies ever (though your millage may vary on the third film).  It seemed an insane idea to reboot such a juggernaut of a franchise, and start over from scratch, taking Peter back to high school, which has always worked out well before (cough cough One More Day cough cough).  So it was with that annoyed mindset that I waited to see how the Amazing Spider-Man would turn out, and whether we would have emo/anguished Peter swinging across New York while wailing that nobody loves him and that his parents are dead and the world sucks.And now, five years after Raimi's trilogy concluded, I finally got to see if Sony had indeed made a really stupid decision, or if they had been right to start fresh.  And as the credits rolled, I sat back in my seat, pondered, and came to the conclusion that....yeah, Sony had jumped the gun.In this telling of Spider-Man, young Peter Parker grows up with his Aunt May and Uncle Ben and...oh, you know how this goes.  High school, bullies, high tech lab, genetically altered spider-bite, super powers, suit, beat up bad guys, etc, etc, etc.  And in a way, this is ""Amazing""'s biggest fault: there's simply no reason to go over any of this.  We've seen Spider-Man's origins before.  We know how he became a hero.  We know Ben is going to die, and that Peter will put on the suit and go fight crime.  He did that back in 2002, and there was no need to do it again, especially when the first did it so well.  I can see people saying that this is Spider-Man for a new generation, much like how ""Batman Begins"" is different from the 1960's ""Batman"", but both those films have completely different tones, and feel like they take place in different worlds.  ""Amazing"" feels like it could easily take place in the world of Raimi's film, and doesn't do much of anything to differentiate the two, which only further adds to the feeling of ""Been there, done that.""But while this telling of Spider-Man's origins is similar to the original, there was a much hyped ""Untold Story"" that would explore different aspects of Peter that we haven't seen before, mainly focusing on his parents, who mysteriously went missing when he was a little boy.  That's a neat idea, and opens up new avenues for the film to pursue.  But nope, this untold story doesn't even get told.  It's said that Peter's dad was working on genetic experimenting, and that some parties don't want Peter to know about other aspects of his life, but that's pretty much it.  There's no secret revelation that Peter's parents were crime-fighting ninjas from the moon, or that Peter was grown in a test tube in Atlantis, or anything of the type.  By the time the film was half over, I had completely forgotten about the supposed secrets that we were promised, and by the end, none of it even matters.  Even Peter himself seems to completely forget that his parents ever existed, and never pursues their disappearance again.Every film so far has had great villains, but ""Amazing"" breaks the trend.  While the appearance of the Lizard (AKA Curt Conners) was hinted at in the previous two films, we finally get to see him here, and unfortunately, he looks like a goomba who wandered off the set of the Super Mario Brothers movie.  And while previous villains had compelling motivations, the Lizard is the weakest one yet, having only the goal of creating an entire race of lizard people.  While on some levels it's understandable (Conners talks about wanting to eliminate perfection in the human race), I thought it felt like an excuse to set up the big final fight.I also felt that, despite almost 5 years of advances in effects work, the CGI in ""Amazing"" felt obvious every time I saw it.  The Lizard himself is done well (especially when he looses body parts that subsequently grow back), but everything else felt fake to me, especially an underwater sequence that I didn't buy for even a second (it also doesn't help that all Peter's web-swinging scenes are at night, which leads to endless shots of colored windows swinging around the screen).  And while James Horner normally does great work, his music here feels unfocused, and at times feels like it should be in a different film altogether.Now, I may be coming down hard on ""Amazing,"" but it had huge shoes to fill (that had already been filled before).  It's simply unnecessary in almost every way.  It has no real reason to exist.  While the little details are different (Gwen instead of Mary Jane, Peter working with Conners instead of being a photographer, etc.), I feel that Raimi's films just did everything better.  Take Peter's motivation for becoming Spider-Man: in the original, Uncle Ben's famous advice on great power and great responsibility, along with Peter's guilt at not being able to save him, and using his powers selfishly, gives him a solid reason to become Spider-Man and fight crime.  In ""Amazing,"" Uncle Ben gives a weaker speech about responsibility and doing good, then dies.  Peter gets angry, creates the costume, and beats up bad guys while trying to find Ben's killer (whom he forgets about as well...does this Peter Parker have brain damage?).  Also, compare Peter's motivation to go after the bad guy.  In the original, Peter went after the Green Goblin, because he had tried to kill Aunt May, and was threatening to kill the love of his life.  Here, Peter goes after Conners because of guilt he has in that he helped create him...a guilt which I hadn't seen before.  It just feels subpar.In the end, I can't give ""Amazing"" a failing grade, because, for all it's faults, it's not a terrible movie.  It's competently put together, with good production values.  It's not terrible, just disappointing.  I felt that everything here has already been done, and done better.  Ben's death was handled better.  Peter's motivations were handled better.  The villains were handled better.  This was a tale that didn't need to be told, and I think it's the weakest Spider-Man film yet.  It's like a book that's been slightly re-written and given a new cover.  You might be fooled for a little bit, but you'll end up saying, ""I've already read this before.  A few things are different, but why would I want to read it again when I want something new?""",2,The Unneeded Arachnid,1341273600,"07 3, 2012",2012,6472,"['Why', 'was', 'thought', 'hounded',

1417772,A2BFIYZYNK54QX,B004LWZWFQ,"James Donnelly ""Ave Atque Vale""","[5, 14]","Columbia Pictures has three franchises to its name: James Bond, Men in Black, and Spider-Man. After the chilly reception that the last Bond film got and the underwhelming performance of MIB III, the next best thing was rebooting the Spider-Man franchise (after only 10 years since the first film) by going with completely new actors, a VERY new director and a new story idea of telling the ""untold"" story of Peter Parker.Sadly, aside from this film's extremely strong and fun first act, the film never regains that same sort of urgency and instead fabricates inorganic momentum in order to set up a finale that feels similarly inorganic and doesn't help to extend the mythology of Spider-Man that we're promised from the film's outset.Director Marc Webb, whose only previous film credit is the extremely quirky and hip anti-rom-com (500) DAYS OF SUMMER, and his extremely talented cast (Andrew Garfield as Peter Parker, Emma Stone sporting her natural blonde hair as Gwen Stacy, Rhys Ifans as Curt Connors, Denis Leary as Capt. George Stacy, Martin Sheen as Uncle Ben and Sally Field as Aunt May) should have more than enough charisma and gravitas to keep momentum going along during the film, but the problem lays not with the cast but with Webb and this film's writers. James Vanderbilt (THE RUNDOWN, ZODIAC), Oscar winner Alvin Sargent (ORDINARY PEOPLE, the last two of Sam Raimi's SPIDER-MAN trilogy), and Steve Kloves (every HARRY POTTER film except GOBLET OF FIRE) have taken what should be a rather long period of time for all of the major events that happen in this film and condense them all to the passage of weeks, not months or even longer. It gives the film and the characters no room to breathe and grow and therefore everything past that first act rings false and when it should pick up momentum again, you've been completely taken out of that exhuberance you were feeling and there's nothing that makes you really look forward to the inevitable final confrontation between Spider-Man and The Lizard, who is the villain of this film. These are all really excellent writers, too, which just makes this sadder.Although despite the clumsy forced dialogue, the extremely clunky second act, the poor Lizard effects (it just doesn't look good, particularly in the facial area), an extremely telegraphed finale (""Oh, look. I'm going to casually show you something as a throw-away in the first act and of course this is going to be the MacGuffin in the climax!""), and the incredibly forced romance between Peter and Gwen, there is something worse.The aesthetic of this film is FAR too dark. Spider-Man, classically, does a good deal of fighting and web-swinging in well-lit and sunny areas. He's a character that is about the light. He's not Batman. He's not a ""dark"" hero, no matter how badly this film wants him to be, because most of this film is set at night or in the dark. I hear the arguments and I get it; sewers are dark and when it's dark out, there's more crime, but this is not a real world. Marc Webb could have challenged himself to distinguish himself as a visual filmmaker as he did in (500) DAYS OF SUMMER rather than doing a very paint-by-numbers summer big-budget action extravaganza.There are other nit-picky things that are more fan-oriented (Where's the Daily Bugle? Where's J. Jonah Jameson? These are essential characters of Peter's formative hero years...) but as I stated, I understand that they're trying to tell a different story than Sam Raimi's first film, but while this film should stand on its own as a separate entity than Raimi's trilogy, it still has to beg comparison and controversy.But oddly enough, while trying to tell a very different story, they end up telling one that is almost virtually identical to Raimi's first chapter. This film hits almost the same exact story beats that Raimi's film did. It tries so hard to distinguish itself from that film that it morphs into almost the exact same film. And what's more upsetting is that while this is a much better cast on paper (both Maguire and Garfield are incredibly talented actors but Garfield is much more engaging rather than the overly emotional Maguire, and Emma Stone is far and away more charming and demands more immediate screen presence than Kirsten Dunst), Raimi was able to encapsulate almost all of the main elements of Peter Parker's life to a much more effective, if occasionally clumsy and stale, debut Spider-Man film.And there is a point in this film where I felt like saying, ""Okay, is there anyone in New York City who DOESN'T know Spider-Man's secret identity?"" I get it; we like to see our masked characters bleed and emote, but this was just too much mask removal.There's a scene at the very end where Peter is sitting in his high school English class, and the teacher is talking about historically there are only about ten different stories that can be told, but the truth is there is only one story that needs to be told... ""Who am I?"", which is an obvious attempt at justifying this film's existence and also a wannabe-clever dig at the people who are out there constantly griping about Hollywood's lack of originality. I thought that this moment was very telling because it is trying to side-step a good portion of its target audience, and also because it consciously knows that it's a blatant attempt to try and get the cash.My advice for the obvious sequel: New director who knows his way around a sizable budget, one or at the maximum two writers who are partners; and as King Claudius says, ""Give me some light!"", because there was something rotten in the state of New York, and Spider-Man should be there to save the DAY, and not take back the night.",2,The Dark Spider Rises.,1343692800,"07 31,

1417781,A1ZR8F86DJRVLX,B004LWZWFQ,Jason Bean,"[2, 3]","There's a lot to like about Marc Webb's reboot of the Spider-Man franchise. The directing is sharp, the action-scenes are well-staged and the cast couldn't be better chosen. Unfortunately The Amazing Spider-Man doesn't do a whole lot to separate itself from Sam Raimi's original trilogy, and despite it's many improvements the movie never feels as engaging as it should.The Amazing Spider-Man starts as a somewhat unnecessary re-telling of the Web-Slinger's origin, but it does have a few interesting twists: A young Peter Parker is left in the care of his Aunt May and Uncle Ben after his parents mysteriously vanish and later die in a plane crash. As a teenager, Peter investigates his father's work which leads him to Dr. Curt Connors (who becomes the villain The Lizard) and the accident which gives him his Spider-like powers. The action shifts between Peter's investigation, his high-school life with romantic interest Gwen Stacy and bully Flash Thompson, and his home-life with his caring Aunt and Uncle. The Amazing Spider-Man plays out in a much more grounded fashion then Raimi's films as we see Peter building his web-shooters and costume (first as just a mask to wear) and going on plain-clothed vigilante-runs before officially becoming Spider Man. I'm not sure if these differences make Webb's movie an improvement over Raimi's but those who thought the original trilogy was too silly should find these changes easier to swallow.As I said before, The Amazing Spider-Man is well cast and Andrew Garfield is a much smarter (and less campy) Peter Parker than Tobey Maguire; Using his web's vibration to track the Lizard through the sewers was a clever gimick and I was especially thrilled hearing Spider-Man taunt the crooks he's hunting down with sarcastic asides and motor-mouthed glibbing. Unfortunately he's not very likeable either and early parts of the film focus way too much on Peter's awkward social-quirks and temper-tantrums. I was a bit more vested once he became Spider Man though, and I especially liked a powerful scene which has Spider Man saving a little child by talking to him while the car they're in slowly falls into the ocean.Martin Sheen, Rhy Ifans and Denis Leary are equally good as Uncle Ben, Dr. Connors and Captain Stacy, a police officer trying to bring down Spider-Man's vigilante actions. Sadly the same can't be said for Sally Field, who's wasted as a one-note Aunt May and Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy; Stone and Garfield have zero chemistry and their unconvicing romance takes up a good chunk of the movie.Obviously my opinion of The Amazing Spider-Man is very mixed. The special-effects are terrific (as is this Hi-Def transfer) and the action-scenes are pretty exciting once the movie picks up (the final showdown with Spider-Man and The Lizard is a pretty cool climax). Overall, though? I really didn't feel one way or the other about this movie. If you thought Sam Raimi's movies were too campy or haven't seen the originals you might want to check out this more level-headed take on Spider Man. Unfortunately for me it was all by-the-numbers with only a good cast to keep me interested.",3,"A well-made, if ineffective reboot..",1356739200,"12 29, 2012",2012,3134,"['lot', 'like', 'Marc', 'Webb', 'reboot', 'Spider-Man', 'franchise', 'directing', 'sharp', 'action-scenes', 'are', 'well-staged', 'cast', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'better', 'chosen', 'Unfortunately', 'Amazing', 'Spider-Man', ""n't"", 'do', 'whole', 'lot', 'separate', 'Sam', 'Raimi', 'original', 'trilogy', 'many', 'improvements', 'movie', 'never', 'as', 'engaging', 'Amazing', 'Spider-Man', 'starts', 'somewhat', 'unnecessary', 're-telling', 'Web-Slinger', 'origin', 'have', 'few', 'interesting', 'twists', 'young', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'left', 'care', 'Aunt', 'May', 'Uncle', 'Ben', 'parents', 'mysteriously', 'vanish', 'later', 'die', 'plane', 'crash', 'teenager', 'Peter', 'father', 'work', 'Dr.', 'Curt', 'Connors', 'who', 'villain', 'Lizard', 'accident', 'Spider-like', 'powers', 'action', 'shifts', 'Peter', 'investigation', 'high-school', 'life', 'romantic', 'interest', 'Gwen', 'Stacy', 'bully', 'Flash', 'Thompson', 'home-life', 'caring', 'Aunt', 'Uncle', 'Amazing', 'Spider-Man', 'out', 'much', 'more', 'grounded', 'fashion', 'then', 'Raimi', 'films', 'see', 'Peter', 'building', 'web-shooters', 'costume', 'first', 'as', 'just', 'mask', 'wear', 'going', 'plain-clothed', 'vigilante-runs', 'officially', 'becoming', 'Spider', 'Man', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'differences', 'make', 'Webb', 'movie', 'improvement', 'Raimi', 'who', 'thought', 'original', 'trilogy', 'was', 'too', 'silly', 'should', 'find', 'changes', 'easier', 'swallow.As', 'said', 'Amazing', 'Spider-Man', 'well', 'cast', 'Andrew', 'Garfield', 'much', 'smarter', 'less', 'campy', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'Using', 'web', 'vibration', 'track', 'Lizard', 'sewers', 'was', 'clever', 'gimick', 'was', 'especially', 'thrilled', 'hearing', 'Spider-Man', 'taunt', 'crooks', 'hunting', 'down', 'sarcastic', 'asides', 'motor-mouthed', 'glibbing', 'Unfortunately', 'not', 'very', 'likeable', 'early', 'parts', 'film', 'focus', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'Peter', 'awkward', 'social-quirks', 'temper-tantrums', 'was', 'bit', 'more', 'vested', 'once', 'became', 'Spider', 'Man', 'especially', 'liked', 'powerful', 'scene', 'Spider', 'Man', 'saving', 'little', 'child', 'talking', 'car', ""'re"", 'slowly', 'ocean.Martin', 'Sheen', 'Rhy', 'Ifans', 'Denis', 'Leary', 'are', 'equally', 'good', 'Uncle', 'Ben', 'Dr.', 'Connors', 'Captain', 'Stacy', 'police', 'officer', 'trying', 'bring', 'down', 'Spider-Man', 'vigilante', 'actions', 'Sadly', 'same', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'said', 'Sally', 'Field', 'who', 'wasted', 'one-note', 'Aunt', 'May', 'Emma', 'Stone', 'Gwen', 'Stacy', 'Stone', 'Garfield', 'have', 'zero', 'chemistry', 'unconvicing', 'romance', 'up', 'good', 'chunk', 'movie.Obviously', 'opinion', 'Amazing', 'Spider-Man', 'very', 'mixed', 'special-effects', 'are', 'terrific', 'Hi-Def', 'transfer', 'action-scenes', 'are', 'pretty', 'exciting', 'once', 'movie', 'up', 'final', 'showdown', 'Spider-Man', 'Lizard', 'pretty', 'cool', 'climax', 'Overall', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'one', 'way', 'other', 'movie', 'thought', 'Sam', 'Raimi', 'movies', 'were', 'too', 'campy', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'originals', 'might', 'want', 'check', 'out', 'more', 'level-headed', 'take', 'Spider', 'Man', 'Unfortunately', 'was', 'by-the-numbers', 'only', 'good', 'cast', 'keep', 'interested']",The Amazing Spider-Man

I have only one minor quibble with this exciting, funny, satisfying, special-effects laden, and ultimately heart-wrenching, film. It should be called ""Spider-Boy: The Genesis"" because the most appealing elements are the scenes where our hero blunders into his spider-like abilities, learns how to use them, and then matures as he comes to grasp the heavy responsibilities that go with them.We see:* Andrew Garfield (""The Social Network"") is Peter Parker/Spider-Man, left by his parents with an aunt and uncle who must raise him when, for some mysterious reason, they never return. He wants to know why.* Emma Stone (""The Help"") is Gwen Stacy, a very bright classmate who intercedes when Peter is bullied. Turns out she is not only smart, she is also resourceful, brave and clearly likes him.* Rhys Ifans (""Anonymous"") is Dr. Curt Conners, a former partner who had worked with Peter's father on cross-species genetics research.* Denis Leary (""Rescue Me"") is Captain Stacy, Gwen's father, out to catch that oddly dressed vigilante who is complicating things on the streets for the police department.* Sally Field (""Brothers and Sisters"") is Aunt May, a practical soul who keeps the home fires burning, even when Peter forgets to buy eggs.* Martin Sheen (""The West Wing"") is Uncle Ben, who should write the book on child rearing. He is the right balance of strict, funny and loving. Peter Parker is a lucky boy.* C. Thomas Howell (""Southland"" remember him in ""E.T.""?) is Jack's Father who watches that oddly dressed vigilante rescue his son Jack from certain drowning. He starts the heart-warming bit. ...smile...This charming and involving PG-13 version has far more aerial battles than I like, but hey! It's ""Spider-Man!"" The final act would never work with an actor of lesser calibre than Garfield. As far as I'm concerned, he can sell anything.When the film ended, we hung back, knowing how Marvel likes to add teasers, and sure enough, there IS one. That means we can look forward to a second installment. I'll bet I end up with another trilogy from Amazon.

Parker is an outcast by choice and is oft pickedon by the jocks of his school, namely Flash Thompson.This Peter Parker mumbles and stutters alot. Peteris just fine with stealing a bottle of milk (hey, hetried to pay for it right?) or keeping quiet when aninnocent man is taken to jail. Morals? Peter Parker dontneed no stinking morals!He likes to take pictures also, but likely just as anexcuse to stalk the pretty girls of his school. Sure hewears glasses too. He puts on a pair of his fathersspectacles, not due to any eye stigma mind you. Nope,rather as the hipster emo this Peter Parker really is.3.) Flash Thompson - Chris ZylkaFlash is both jock and school bully. An over the topschool bully, prone to punching Parker and pushing otherstudents around. Where are the teachers during all theseincidents and why is this Flash not locked up some where?Oh well. This Flash picks on Parker seemingly with thehope that Parker will join his group of jocks. In onescene Flash gives Parker a big hug and tells him somethingalong the lines of ""You are coming along fine Parker, seeyou tomorrow so we can dunk the new kids head in atoilet."" Well something like that any way...4.) May Parker - Sally FieldThe flying nun is aunt May. Wait are they serious? Theycast Sally Field as Aunt May? So Peter Parker alwayscomes home with these large bruises all over his face andbody but our Aunt May never really questions why. Shejust sits there in utter disbelief. Our Parker does not seemto care much for Aunt May or ole Uncle Ben for thatmatter anyway.5.) Ben Parker - Martin SheenCharlie Sheens dad is Ben Parker. We all know how Charlieturned out so now we understand what went wrong with thisjerk Peter.6.) George Stacy - Denis LearyStacy is younger here. He is kinda clueless most of thetime and does not like Spider-Man at all. Leary is goodin spots but something is off. Leary didn't know muchabout Spider-Man stories to begin with and he kindaphones it in most scenes.7.) Lizard Doc Connors - Rhys IfansThe CGI lizard looks bad in most scenes. It looks too digitaland the movements are not at all natural. Dr Connorsfeels like a stand-in for the role. Just mostly a rushedcharacter and not too well defined.8.) Spider-Man - CGI & Andrew GarfieldThe POV scenes are awful. The CGI is TOO digital. ThisSpider-Man can duck bullets in one scene but has tooutrun a group of slow thugs in the next. Oh by the by, Spidey is ajerk too. He has to have cranes lined up at one point sohe can quickly get to a tower. Spidey is limited instrength as well. He gets hurt easily and is very weak.At the same time he lightly touches a door knob and itexplodes. Does his super power turn on and off at random?In some scenes his head is too big like..an alien.",1,The Un-Amazing Spider-Guy,1352592000,"11 11, 2012",2012,4221,"['What', 'Got', 'Right', '1', 'Gwen', 'Stacy', 'Emma', 'StonePerfect', 'casting', 'Gwen.She', 'smart', 'charismatic', 'times', 'rebellious', 'Forsome', 'reason', 'interested', 'elitist', 'emo', 'type', 'namedPeter', 'Parker', 'Go', 'figure.2', 'Bluebird', 'Sally', 'Avril', 'Kelsey', 'ChowKelsey', 'Chow', 'fresh', 'Disney', 'channel', 'big', 'screen.She', 'brief', 'appearance', 'here', 'one', 'theonly', 'characters', 'get', 'right', 'horrid', 'mess.She', 'gorgeous', 'not', 'interested', 'Peter', 'Withhow', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'do', ""n't"", 'blame', 'her.3', 'Parker', 'Builds', 'A', 'Web-Shooter', 'Web', 'Slinger', 'great', 'Too', 'bad', 'stole', 'webbing.4', 'Stan', 'LeeYup', 'Stan', 'Lee', 'cameo', 'Got', 'Wrong', '1', '3D', 'elements', 'Blu-ray', 'are', 'worstI', 'have', 'ever', 'encountered', 'Scenes', 'appear', 'first', 'tobe', 'suited', '3D', 'spectacle', 'fall', 'far', 'short', 'Most', 'ofthe', 'picture', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'flat', '2D', 'onlya', ""'few"", 'scenes', 'have', 'pop.2', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'Andrew', 'GarfieldPeter', 'Parker', 'self', 'serving', 'arrogant', 'hipster', 'witha', 'skateboard', 'feet', 'Ipod', 'always', 'hand.He', 'disobedient', 'authority', 'elitist', 'hesees', 'aka', 'teachers', 'nerdy', 'students', '.Peter', 'Parker', 'bad', 'boy', 'emo', 'type', 'once', 'allthis', 'catch', 'attention', 'two', 'girls', 'mainlyfellow', 'student', 'Gwen', 'Stacy', 'Peter', 'prone', 'lie', 'toothers', 'resent', 'aunt', 'May', 'Uncle', 'Ben.He', 'highly', 'intelligent', 'seemingly', 'snob', 'aresult', 'Parker', 'outcast', 'choice', 'oft', 'pickedon', 'jocks', 'school', 'namely', 'Flash', 'Thompson.This', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'mumbles', 'stutters', 'alot', 'Peteris', 'just', 'fine', 'stealing', 'bottle', 'milk', 'hey', 'hetried', 'pay', 'right', 'keeping', 'quiet', 'when', 'aninnocent', 'man', 'taken', 'jail', 'Morals', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'dontneed', 'stinking', 'morals', 'take', 'pictures', 'also', 'likely', 'just', 'as', 'anexcuse', 'stalk', 'pretty', 'girls', 'school', 'Sure', 'hewears', 'glasses', 'too', 'pair', 'fathersspectacles', 'not', 'due', 'eye', 'stigma', 'mind', 'Nope', 'rather', 'hipster', 'emo', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'really', 'is.3', 'Flash', 'Thompson', 'Chris', 'ZylkaFlash', 'jock', 'school', 'bully', 'topschool', 'bully', 'prone', 'punching', 'Parker', 'pushing', 'otherstudents', 'are', 'teachers', 'theseincidents', 'why', 'Flash', 'not', 'locked', 'up', 'where', 'Oh', 'well', 'Flash', 'Parker', 'seemingly', 'thehope', 'Parker', 'will', 'join', 'group', 'jocks', 'onescene', 'Flash', 'Parker', 'big', 'hug', 'somethingalong', 'lines', 'are', 'coming', 'along', 'fine', 'Parker', 'seeyou', 'tomorrow', 'can', 'dunk', 'new', 'kids', 'head', 'atoilet', 'Well', 'something', 'way', '4', 'May', 'Parker', 'Sally', 'FieldThe', 'flying', 'nun', 'aunt', 'May', 'Wait', 'are', 'serious', 'Theycast', 'Sally', 'Field', 'Aunt', 'May', 'So', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'home', 'large', 'bruises', 'face', 'andbody', 'Aunt', 'May', 'never', 'really', 'questions', 'why', 'Shejust', 'sits', 'there', 'utter', 'disbelief', 'Parker', 'not', 'seemto', 'care', 'much', 'Aunt', 'May', 'ole', 'Uncle', 'Ben', 'thatmatter', 'anyway.5', 'Ben', 'Parker', 'Martin', 'SheenCharlie', 'Sheens', 'dad', 'Ben', 'Parker', 'know', 'how', 'Charlieturned', 'out', 'so', 'now', 'understand', 'what', 'went', 'wrong', 'thisjerk', 'Peter.6', 'George', 'Stacy', 'Denis', 'LearyStacy', 'younger', 'here', 'kinda', 'clueless', 'most', 'thetime', 'not', 'like', 'Spider-Man', 'Leary', 'goodin', 'spots', 'something', 'off', 'Leary', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'muchabout', 'Spider-Man', 'stories', 'begin', 'most', 'scenes.7', 'Lizard', 'Doc', 'Connors', 'Rhys', 'IfansThe', 'CGI', 'lizard', 'bad', 'most', 'scenes', 'too', 'digitaland', 'movements', 'are', 'not', 'natural', 'Dr', 'Connorsfeels', 'stand-in', 'role', 'Just', 'mostly', 'rushedcharacter', 'not', 'too', 'well', 'defined.8', 'Spider-Man', 'CGI', 'Andrew', 'GarfieldThe', 'POV', 'scenes', 'are', 'awful', 'CGI', 'TOO', 'digital', 'ThisSpider-Man', 'can', 'duck', 'bullets', 'one', 'scene', 'tooutrun', 'group', 'slow', 'thugs', 'next', 'Oh', 'Spidey', 'ajerk', 'too', 'have', 'cranes', 'lined', 'up', 'one', 'point', 'sohe', 'can', 'quickly', 'get', 'tower', 'Spidey', 'limited', 'instrength', 'as', 'well', 'hurt', 'easily', 'very', 'weak.At', 'same', 'time', 'lightly', 'door', 'knob', 'itexplodes', 'super', 'power', 'turn', 'off', 'random', 'scenes', 'head', 'too', 'big', 'like..an', 'alien']",The Amazing Spider-Man

But for those of you like me who grew up with the real Amazing Spider-man and even the series on Fox, seeing this movie will less than amaze you.  Granted, it's better than Sam Raimi's Spiderman 3, but then again, what isn't??  The fact that Emma Stone and Andrew Garfield are an actual item off the screen doesn't help, since there are too many romantic scenes.  Spoiler: realistically, no girl would ever french a guy who spent his night swimming in doodie cookie water.  The story is too long, considering it takes a good hour and some change for Peter to finally dawn the costume.  And when he does, he stalks his suspects from atop gargoyles and rooftops.  It felt more like a Bruce Wayne on a budget hero than a ""oh wow, that was Spider!!"".  Honestly, he spends most of the movie twitchy and being angry than being the quick-witted sarcastic Spidey of the comics.The highly anticipated Lizard, fairly done.  He is grizzly and terrifying, but when you finally see him it's rather underwhelming.  Oh, and I should mention, for a Spider-man film, you would expect web-slinging since that is his trademark.  Yeah, not so much since that part of his character seems to have been written out.  Not too mention the yellow eyes threw me off a bit, but that's just me.

I had problems with the first Spider-man movie too, I found the Green Goblin to be very annoying for instance, but the origin story in Spiderman 1 with Toby Maguire was perfection! Sam Raimi's addition of biological based web spinners was an inspiration to the to the Spidey canon, so WHY go backwards and give the web-slinger mechanically based webs? How could a high school kid like Peter Parker afford super high tech web spinners, not to mention the refills! Why change the origin story from a nuclear irradiated spider that bites Peter Parker to a regular spider that may or may not have been genetically altered? Why make Peter Parker a jerk who, as soon as he acquires his powers becomes a bully who now bullies his former bully Flash, and then steals Flash's girlfriend. Don't worry, for some inexplicable reason, Flash forgives by the end of the movie.. Andrew Garfield isn't awful, Sally Field and Martin Sheen, all try their best with a terrible script. For instance, when Peter comes home late after being bitten by the spider, he's sweaty, sick looking and literally raids the fridge while his seemingly unconcerned Uncle Ben and Aunt May make jokes about her awful meatloaf... HELLO? Your nephew Peter looks like he's on DRUGS and you two are too oblivious to see it? The problem is the illogical script, but it's also bad direction, not to mention continuity errors.

1417794,A1QHW2L0RU54QQ,B004LWZWFQ,jeheist,"[1, 2]","Recently watched movie review:*The Amazing Spider-Man (2012)- 4.5/5The Amazing Spider-Man is a remake of Spider-Man that came out in 2002. I hardly remember the 2002 version, so I really can't compare the two movies, so I reviewed The Amazing Spider-Man on its own terms. I didn't want to see it, but I felt very satisfied afterward.The Amazing Spider-Man opens up with a young boy named Peter Parker who discovers that someone broke into his parents' house to steal important documents. His parents' drop Peter off at his Aunt May and Uncle Ben's house to live there for a while. Years later, Peter Parker, who's played by 'Andrew Garfield', is in high school and is a victim of bullying. Standing up to the bully, he meets Gwen Stacy, who's played by 'Emma Stone'.Peter finds his dads' secret papers and learns that his father worked with Scientist, Dr. Curt Connors, who's played by 'Rhys Ifans'. Peter finds out where Dr. Curt Connors works at, meets up with Gwen, and he sneaks into a lab where a biocable is being created from genetically modified spiders. Peter touches something in the lab that he shouldn't have touched and one of the modified spiders bites him. Peter now has spider-like abilities and then uses his new abilities to hunt criminals, while a giant lizard is on the loose.The Amazing Spider-Man does a lot of things right and only a few things wrong. For starters, it has a good cast, lots of detail in the plot, and just the right amount of action. Sure, The Amazing Spider-Man revisits many of the same plot points from the 2002 version, but the movie is done well enough that most viewers won't care about the same plot points. The movie takes about an hour before any action really happens; it seems many superhero movies have far too much CGI and not enough story and character development, so I like that the movie took its time.The Amazing Spider-Man has its moments of cheesy dialog, but I expected it to happen and forgave most of the 'rolling eyeball' lines. I don't want to give away too much, but there is plot in the movie where Spider-Man is looking for a certain criminal. The film spends roughly about 15 minutes where this is happening and after 15 minutes, nothing is to show for wasting my time. This irked me, thus resulting in a non-perfect movie score. If you have any interest in seeing the reboot version, I highly recommend that you give The Amazing Spider-Man a 'rent.'Edit/Delete Message",5,Recently watched movie review: The Amazing Spider-Man (2012),1353628800,"11 23, 2012",2012,2438,"['Recently', 'watched', 'movie', 'review', '*The', 'Amazing', 'Spider-Man', '2012', '4.5/5The', 'Amazing', 'Spider-Man', 'remake', 'Spider-Man', 'came', 'out', '2002', 'hardly', 'remember', '2002', 'version', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'compare', 'two', 'movies', 'reviewed', 'Amazing', 'Spider-Man', 'own', 'terms', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'see', 'felt', 'very', 'satisfied', 'afterward.The', 'Amazing', 'Spider-Man', 'up', 'young', 'boy', 'named', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'who', 'someone', 'broke', 'parents', 'house', 'steal', 'important', 'documents', 'parents', 'drop', 'Peter', 'off', 'Aunt', 'May', 'Uncle', 'Ben', 'house', 'live', 'there', 'while', 'Years', 'later', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'who', 'played', ""'Andrew"", 'Garfield', 'high', 'school', 'victim', 'bullying', 'Standing', 'up', 'bully', 'Gwen', 'Stacy', 'who', 'played', ""'Emma"", ""Stone'.Peter"", 'dads', 'secret', 'papers', 'father', 'worked', 'Scientist', 'Dr.', 'Curt', 'Connors', 'who', 'played', ""'Rhys"", 'Ifans', 'Peter', 'out', 'where', 'Dr.', 'Curt', 'Connors', 'up', 'Gwen', 'lab', 'where', 'biocable', 'being', 'created', 'genetically', 'modified', 'spiders', 'Peter', 'something', 'lab', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'touched', 'one', 'modified', 'spiders', 'Peter', 'now', 'spider-like', 'abilities', 'then', 'new', 'abilities', 'hunt', 'criminals', 'giant', 'lizard', 'loose.The', 'Amazing', 'Spider-Man', 'lot', 'things', 'right', 'only', 'few', 'things', 'wrong', 'starters', 'good', 'cast', 'lots', 'detail', 'plot', 'just', 'right', 'amount', 'action', 'Sure', 'Amazing', 'Spider-Man', 'many', 'same', 'plot', 'points', '2002', 'version', 'movie', 'done', 'well', 'enough', 'most', 'viewers', 'wo', ""n't"", 'care', 'same', 'plot', 'points', 'movie', 'hour', 'action', 'really', 'many', 'superhero', 'movies', 'have', 'far', 'too', 'much', 'CGI', 'not', 'enough', 'story', 'character', 'development', 'so', 'like', 'movie', 'took', 'time.The', 'Amazing', 'Spider-Man', 'moments', 'cheesy', 'dialog', 'expected', 'happen', 'forgave', 'most', ""'rolling"", 'eyeball', 'lines', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'away', 'too', 'much', 'plot', 'movie', 'where', 'Spider-Man', 'looking', 'certain', 'criminal', 'film', 'roughly', '15', 'minutes', 'where', 'happening', '15', 'minutes', 'nothing', 'show', 'wasting', 'time', 'irked', 'thus', 'resulting', 'non-perfect', 'movie', 'score', 'have', 'interest', 'seeing', 'reboot', 'version', 'highly', 'recommend', 'give', 'Amazing', 'Spider-Man', ""'rent"", ""'Edit/Delete"", 'Message']",The Amazing Spider-Man

1417800,A3KNGGHPT859N,B004LWZWFQ,"J. Gibson ""Movie Lover""","[0, 0]","I for one feel somewhat let down after watching the Amazing Spiderman... if I were to name it based on how it made me feel I would call it The Re-Marketed Spiderman... or maybe Spiderman .78... as in a passing grade.  Peter Parker and his girl friend (Emma Stone character Gwen Stacy) they seem in my opinion too old for their parts.  Their relationship seems too mature for even extremely bright college bound teenagers.  They are both probably in their early to mid twenties.  I found myself missing Tobey Maguire's sweet naivit&eacute; which helped him play the teenaged Spiderman.  When they show the two leads together in this adaption they jump right into serious from the start and the Peter Parker acts too hormone charged.  There is a gritty element that I'm not sure parents of younger children would want them to see.  It's not spoken as much as just darker, more need driven in the way Parker kisses Stacy.  And, with the Tobey Maguire version this was not an issue at all.  All this being said it is probably a film that most parents would allow their 12+ to see.  You know if your kids can handle it or if you have already shown this similar styles of super hero films.  There was no bad language issues other than scenes with dialogue concerning death.  I've recently seen Captain America and Thor recently and I felt they were fine for a  slightly younger aged child... say 8+ as long as the child has an interest and the parent is there with them while viewing them.So, all that being said now I'll just talk in regard to adults. The Dr. Connors villain is pretty standard fare.  His character is not very developed and there was probably more that could have been done to add more dimension to the Dr. Connors through more of a back-story. All we really know is that he knew Peter Parker's father and you can see that he is minus one arm and this seems to be a major part of his motivation in his lab work.  Dennis Leary plays Gwens father who is a Police Captain.I'm not sorry I purchased this movie and may watch it again.

Peter goes to Oscorp where his father's former colleague, Doc Connors (Rhys Ifans) works as a scientist. While there, he wanders into an experiment that has to do with...special spiders and of course he gets bit. Gets his special spidey powers, has a run in with Flash Thompson (Chris Zylka) and Uncle Ben (Martin Sheen) of course meets his maker...again.Despite all that I was never disappointed by the Amazing Spider-Man since not everything in this film was done in the Sam Raimi original. With Peter in the originals, we mostly just saw him raise his hand in class or people call him smart but here we finally get to see how smart he really is. He creates his web shooter and doesn't simply shoot webs out his wrists and also helps Doc Connors in his lab. While a small thing I love, is how Flash  is a bully to Peter but a fan of Spider-Man, like I've seen in recent Spider-Man shows, I got a kick out of that.We also get Emma Stone as a hot and adorable Gwen Stacy who has wonderful chemistry with Garfield. Dennis Leary as a better Captain Stacy than James Cromwell was in Spider-Man 3, mostly because we get to see his love for his daughter. While in Spider-Man 3 he just calmly stood there when she was hanging from a building and said ""Gwen? What is she doing up there? "" It's also nice to finally get the Lizard since Raimi was very slowly getting to that. Even before Spider-Man 4 was canceled, John Malkovich was cast as Vulture, so Raimi still wasn't getting to the Lizard.Andrew Garfield stands out less as Peter Parker than Tobey Maguire did, Garfield looks like any normal teenager of today. While Maguire was a bit of an over the top nerd, even when he should have been a badass with the black suit on in part 3. Garfield I think hams it up better with the suit on as he has a quick tongue and is the goofy wise-ass Spider-Man is meant to be. While Emma Stone is sweet as Gwen and less moody and self-centered as Kirsten Dunst's Mary Jane. So sue me, but I loved this movie and can't wait for more. I also hope the studios start realizing that Spider-Man and Batman movies deserve more than just 3 movies.",4,"Big Improvement Over Spider-Man 3 ""Some Spoilers""",1341532800,"07 6, 2012",2012,2242,"['Years', 'death', 'parents', 'teenager', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'Andrew', 'Garfield', 'answers', 'mysterious', 'death', 'Peter', 'Oscorp', 'where', 'father', 'former', 'colleague', 'Doc', 'Connors', 'Rhys', 'Ifans', 'scientist', 'there', 'experiment', 'do', 'special', 'spiders', 'course', 'bit', 'Gets', 'special', 'spidey', 'powers', 'run', 'Flash', 'Thompson', 'Chris', 'Zylka', 'Uncle', 'Ben', 'Martin', 'Sheen', 'course', 'meets', 'maker', 'again.Despite', 'was', 'never', 'disappointed', 'Amazing', 'Spider-Man', 'not', 'everything', 'film', 'was', 'done', 'Sam', 'Raimi', 'original', 'Peter', 'originals', 'mostly', 'just', 'saw', 'raise', 'hand', 'class', 'people', 'call', 'smart', 'here', 'finally', 'get', 'see', 'how', 'smart', 'really', 'web', 'shooter', ""n't"", 'simply', 'shoot', 'webs', 'wrists', 'also', 'Doc', 'Connors', 'lab', 'small', 'thing', 'love', 'how', 'Flash', 'bully', 'Peter', 'fan', 'Spider-Man', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'recent', 'Spider-Man', 'shows', 'got', 'kick', 'that.We', 'also', 'get', 'Emma', 'Stone', 'hot', 'adorable', 'Gwen', 'Stacy', 'who', 'wonderful', 'chemistry', 'Garfield', 'Dennis', 'Leary', 'better', 'Captain', 'Stacy', 'James', 'Cromwell', 'was', 'Spider-Man', '3', 'mostly', 'get', 'see', 'love', 'daughter', 'Spider-Man', '3', 'just', 'calmly', 'stood', 'when', 'was', 'hanging', 'building', 'said', 'Gwen', 'What', 'doing', 'up', 'there', 'also', 'nice', 'finally', 'get', 'Lizard', 'Raimi', 'was', 'very', 'slowly', 'getting', 'Even', 'Spider-Man', '4', 'was', 'canceled', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'was', 'cast', 'Vulture', 'so', 'Raimi', 'still', 'was', ""n't"", 'getting', 'Lizard.Andrew', 'Garfield', 'out', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'did', 'Garfield', 'normal', 'teenager', 'today', 'Maguire', 'was', 'bit', 'top', 'nerd', 'even', 'when', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'badass', 'black', 'suit', 'part', '3', 'Garfield', 'think', 'hams', 'up', 'better', 'suit', 'quick', 'tongue', 'goofy', 'wise-ass', 'Spider-Man', 'meant', 'be', 'Emma', 'Stone', 'sweet', 'Gwen', 'less', 'moody', 'self-centered', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'So', 'sue', 'loved', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'more', 'also', 'hope', 'studios', 'start', 'realizing', 'Spider-Man', 'Batman', 'movies', 'deserve', 'more', 'just', '3', 'movies']",The Amazing Spider-Man

He successfully saves the boy from further humiliation to only get beat up himself.He has a crush on Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone) and she notices him saving the boy.

While at the labs he is bitten by a mutant spider and his life changes forever...I didn't know what to expect from this remake of the original Spiderman series. What I found was that it really was not a remake but a rebirth of the Spiderman movies with a new cast, a slightly different story and great computer graphics animation. I enjoyed the story and the acting of Garfield and Stone was very good. The villain Dr. Curt Conners (really his alter ego) (played by Rhys Ifans) was a very good role and the actor did a great job portraying the good professor and the evil mutant.The special effects were well done in this movie and as the technology improves you would expect such an enhancement in this newer edition. I was glad that the movie was not just a remake of the original movie but it had some story changes including the new villain of the professor instead of the Green Goblin. I found the relationship between Peter Parker and Gwen Stacy to be interesting and Emma Stone did a marvelous job in the role. I wasn't sure of what to expect of her in the movie but I was impressed with her performance.The movie to me was good and it obviously is a set up for the next Spiderman movie to be made. They are going to dig gold in this franchise series until it is worn out. The movie is worth seeing and if you are a true Spiderman fan you will enjoy just seeing another well-made action movie about your hero. The movie is somewhere between a 4 and a 5 star rating but for some reason 4 stars seems for appropriate. If they continue making the movies that follow as well done as this one, then the directors and producers have justified remaking this series.

1417820,A356HRZZFCEGL1,B004LWZWFQ,"John Panagopoulos ""John Andrew Panagopoulos""","[1, 2]","The Amazing Peter Parker***This review may contain spoilers.***Initially, like many people, my knee-jerk response to &#8220;The Amazing Spiderman&#8221; (hereafter TAS) was &#8220;unnecessary and redundant&#8221;.  I felt that Tobey Maguire&#8217;s interpretation on the famed arachnoid (and Peter Parker) was thoroughly satisfying and complete.  Therefore, I didn&#8217;t bother seeing TAS at the Cineplex.  But recently on cable, Encore was periodically showing TAS and, eventually giving into my curiosity, sat down one Saturday morning to give TAS a chance.  Now I wish I had seen TAS in the movie theatre.  Although it covers the usual Spidey origin trajectory (nerdy but brainy loner, loving aunt/uncle, bite from genetically altered spider, subsequent infusion of powers and confidence, emergence of outlandish but deadly villain), I think TAS does a more touching, affecting, and dare I say it, grittily realistic depiction of Spiderman, and more importantly, Peter Parker.Too often, superheroes eclipse their alter egos and give us the often mistaken impression that without their powers, they are nobodies (&#8220;Hero to Zero&#8221;, you might say).  Many superhero movies seem to reflect that impression and somewhat rush the origin story so that we can get to the exciting hero as quickly as possible.  I think Sam Raimi&#8217;s &#8220;Spiderman&#8221; did that to some extent, acknowledging but accelerating Maguire&#8217;s Peter Parker angst, sorrow, and alienation so that people didn&#8217;t feel too down and could get to see their high-swinging, inspirational hero as soon as possible.  Director Mark Webb&#8217;s TAS takes more deliberate, measured time in revealing Spidey because I think he wants the audience to realize that Peter Parker is an amazing kid way before the fateful spider gets to him.So instead of rushing through the tense high school drama to get to college, as Maguire&#8217;s Parker did, Andrew Garfield&#8217;s Parker remains in high school and emotionally, uncomfortably, but convincingly reminds us how harrowing that environment can be, especially to a reserved, sometimes inarticulate loner and orphan.  And yet, Peter is far from pathetic.  In TAS, he is a skilled photographer and skateboarder.  He is also an accomplished science student, and he proves it when he deciphers his late parents&#8217; science papers, formulas, and algorithms, especially the missing formula that completes amputee Dr. Curtis Connor&#8217;s (Rhys Ifans&#8217;s) successful but horrifyingly reptilian tissue regeneration.  Of course, unlike Maguire&#8217;s Spidey&#8217;s organic webs, Garfield&#8217;s Parker devises the web fluid and dispensers himself.  Furthermore, Garfield&#8217;s Parker conducts extensive research to learn why, as a 4-year old (Max Charles), he was left with his uncle Ben (Martin Sheen) and Aunt May (Sally Field), and begins to uncover an intricate connection between his parents, Oscorp, and Dr. Connors (and a mysterious stranger).Garfield, however, is careful not to make Parker into a perfect goody-goody.  Perhaps because of his &#8220;abandonment&#8221; by his parents, Parker has rebellious, mischievous tendencies that would lure him into juvenile delinquency if not for his uncle/aunt and a potential love interest, Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone).  Parker can also be irresponsible, spiteful, and distracted, which leads to that life-altering, emotionally shattering family tragedy involving Uncle Ben.  Although basically polite and respectful, Parker manages to antagonize and disconcert Gwen&#8217;s father, Police Captain Stacy (Denis Leary) who (like Daily Bugle newspaper publisher J. Jonah Jameson in Raimi&#8217;s film), considers Spiderman a selfish, dangerous vigilante, despite Parker&#8217;s earnest protests.Nevertheless, I think Parker earns the audiences admiration as he begins to rise above his shortcomings and use his natural talents (with a little help with his spider powers) to balance, juggle, and reconcile his personal, romantic, and &#8220;professional&#8221; problems.  In fact, I believe that Parker is such an intriguing character on his own, the movie would still be involving and entertaining even if Parker tackled his problems without his powers.  As Uncle Ben&#8217;s posthumous voicemail on Parker&#8217;s cell phone mentions, Peter was always destined for great things.  The spider powers just make his life a little more interesting.P.S.:  Commenting upon the Lizard&#8217;s appearance in the movie, I personally had no complaints.  As a cross between a Komodo dragon and the Hulk, the Lizard sported a too-human face, according to some detractors.  I think that was essential to convey the Lizard&#8217;s/Dr. Connors latent, if somewhat misguided, humanity and his final, merciful treatment of Parker/Spiderman. If the Lizard had had to speak and show his feelings with a snout like, say, a Velociraptor, I think it would have less effective, and even a bit laughable.",5,The Amazing Peter Parker,1384387200,"11

1417825,AXYEW4EJR2BIA,B004LWZWFQ,"Jonathan ""cinematicaddiction&#8228;com""","[1, 3]","The Amazing Spider-Man is a reboot of the Spider-Man film series that essentially tells the same story with different characters. Peter Parker is a social outcast in high school, he's bitten by a radioactive spider, he gains superpowers, he gets the girl, and he fights the villain he's partly responsible for. (a basic summary of the movie, but it'll do). The Amazing Spider-Man is a surprisingly fun and thrilling reboot of the beloved franchise.As I previously mentioned, the story doesn't really trek into unfamiliar territory. Fortunately, I personally enjoy the Spider-Man origin story and didn't mind watching it again; it's a story that's fun and feels relatable, in my opinion. The action in this film is thrilling, from the actual fight scenes to the adrenaline-filled web swinging; there's also a bit of comedy and romance spread throughout the film, without losing focus. I also enjoyed the style in this film; the special effects felt unique/distinct and brought some variety to the superhero genre, whereas most recent superhero films seem to be leaning towards the dark and gritty tone (not a bad thing). The design of the Lizard was decent, but ultimately underwhelming. I was originally very skeptical over the reboot of this franchise, so my expectations were admittedly low; the film did impress and entertain me, though, and I can't deny that.Overall, I really enjoyed The Amazing Spider-Man- it's a truly amazing action film. The lack of innovation and the underwhelming villain design are the only reasons I gave this 4-stars instead of 5 (although I was close to doing so.) I recommend a purchase for fans of superhero and action films, a rental for those that oppose reboots/remakes or are a bit skeptical.The Amazing Spider-Man has some violence and blood.",4,A Surprisingly Fun and Thrilling Reboot...,1359244800,"01 27, 2013",2013,1781,"['Amazing', 'Spider-Man', 'reboot', 'Spider-Man', 'film', 'series', 'essentially', 'same', 'story', 'different', 'characters', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'social', 'outcast', 'high', 'school', 'bitten', 'radioactive', 'spider', 'gains', 'superpowers', 'girl', 'villain', 'partly', 'responsible', 'basic', 'summary', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'do', 'Amazing', 'Spider-Man', 'surprisingly', 'fun', 'thrilling', 'reboot', 'beloved', 'franchise.As', 'previously', 'mentioned', 'story', ""n't"", 'really', 'trek', 'unfamiliar', 'territory', 'Fortunately', 'personally', 'enjoy', 'Spider-Man', 'origin', 'story', 'did', ""n't"", 'mind', 'watching', 'again', 'story', 'fun', 'feels', 'relatable', 'opinion', 'action', 'film', 'thrilling', 'actual', 'fight', 'scenes', 'adrenaline-filled', 'web', 'swinging', 'also', 'bit', 'comedy', 'romance', 'spread', 'film', 'losing', 'focus', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'style', 'film', 'special', 'effects', 'felt', 'unique/distinct', 'brought', 'variety', 'superhero', 'genre', 'whereas', 'most', 'recent', 'superhero', 'films', 'seem', 'be', 'leaning', 'dark', 'gritty', 'tone', 'not', 'bad', 'thing', 'design', 'Lizard', 'was', 'decent', 'ultimately', 'underwhelming', 'was', 'originally', 'very', 'skeptical', 'reboot', 'franchise', 'expectations', 'were', 'admittedly', 'low', 'film', 'did', 'impress', 'entertain', 'though', 'ca', ""n't"", 'deny', 'that.Overall', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'Amazing', 'Spider-Man-', 'truly', 'amazing', 'action', 'film', 'lack', 'innovation', 'underwhelming', 'villain', 'design', 'are', 'only', 'reasons', 'gave', '4-stars', 'instead', '5', 'was', 'close', 'doing', 'so', 'recommend', 'purchase', 'fans', 'superhero', 'action', 'films', 'rental', 'oppose', 'reboots/remakes', 'are', 'bit', 'skeptical.The', 'Amazing', 'Spider-Man', 'violence', 'blood']",The Amazing Spider-Man

His dad in particular since he was a scientist working on a secret project, having no answers to this, there's one man who can provide some, his former partner Dr. Connors (Rhys Ifans, ""Notting Hill"") who has one arm and is researching a way to do cross species medical procedures that would take care of any ailment and regrow limbs.Of course he tries this procedure on himself and at first it works but then the side effects take place and he becomes a famous ""Spider-Man"" villain 'The Lizard'. Meanwhile Peter becomes bit by a spider in a lab and takes on spider like powers which are at first troubling but he finds that they can benefit him and after his uncle Ben (Martin Sheen, NBC's ""The West Wing"") is killed by a thug Peter goes on the hunt to find this criminal and also to take down this Lizard before he destroys the city and or turns the population into lizard creatures like himself.The movie itself feels very unnecessary as while Raimi's vision of Spider-Man was met with both praise and scorn from fans and movie-goers alike, this film isn't really all that interesting. Garfield as Peter is decent I guess, his love interest Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone, ""Zombieland"") isn't too good and their building romance feels very ""Twilight-esque"" and is pretty bland.The action also isn't all the spectacular either, it feels all too familiar, like the bridge sequence where Spidey has to save people in their cars from falling off the bridge due to the Lizard's rampage. There's not a lot of drama or interest in whether key people survive or not, it was way too early to do a reboot of this series in my opinion and even worse to do one that felt so pedestrian and by the book, with many cliches and the conclusion brings up the possibility of the eventual sequel. *1/2 out of 4 stars.",2,"More like ""The Somewhat Average Spider-Man""",1353196800,"11 18, 2012",2012,2228,"['Possible', 'Spoilers', 'Barely', '10', 'years', 'Sam', 'Raimi', 'directed', 'Spider-Man', 'trilogy', 'starring', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'web', 'shooting', 'superhero', 'have', 'relaunch', 'where', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'Andrew', 'Garfield', 'Social', 'Network', 'high', 'school', 'genius/outast', 'are', 'there', 'ever', 'other', 'kinds', 'movies', 'who', 'trying', 'piece', 'together', 'childhood', 'memories', 'discover', 'why', 'parents', 'put', 'aunt', 'uncle', 'when', 'was', 'young', 'dad', 'particular', 'was', 'scientist', 'working', 'secret', 'project', 'having', 'answers', 'one', 'man', 'who', 'can', 'provide', 'former', 'partner', 'Dr.', 'Connors', 'Rhys', 'Ifans', 'Notting', 'Hill', 'who', 'one', 'arm', 'researching', 'way', 'do', 'cross', 'species', 'medical', 'procedures', 'would', 'take', 'care', 'ailment', 'regrow', 'limbs.Of', 'course', 'procedure', 'first', 'then', 'side', 'effects', 'take', 'place', 'famous', 'Spider-Man', 'villain', 'Lizard', 'Meanwhile', 'Peter', 'becomes', 'bit', 'spider', 'lab', 'spider', 'powers', 'are', 'first', 'troubling', 'can', 'benefit', 'uncle', 'Ben', 'Martin', 'Sheen', 'NBC', 'West', 'Wing', 'killed', 'thug', 'Peter', 'hunt', 'find', 'criminal', 'also', 'take', 'down', 'Lizard', 'city', 'population', 'lizard', 'creatures', 'himself.The', 'movie', 'feels', 'very', 'unnecessary', 'Raimi', 'vision', 'Spider-Man', 'was', 'met', 'praise', 'scorn', 'fans', 'movie-goers', 'alike', 'film', ""n't"", 'really', 'all', 'interesting', 'Garfield', 'Peter', 'decent', 'guess', 'love', 'interest', 'Gwen', 'Stacy', 'Emma', 'Stone', 'Zombieland', ""n't"", 'too', 'good', 'building', 'romance', 'feels', 'very', 'Twilight-esque', 'pretty', 'bland.The', 'action', 'also', ""n't"", 'spectacular', 'too', 'familiar', 'bridge', 'sequence', 'where', 'Spidey', 'save', 'people', 'cars', 'falling', 'off', 'bridge', 'due', 'Lizard', 'rampage', 'not', 'lot', 'drama', 'interest', 'key', 'people', 'survive', 'not', 'was', 'way', 'too', 'early', 'do', 'reboot', 'series', 'opinion', 'even', 'worse', 'do', 'one', 'felt', 'so', 'pedestrian', 'book', 'many', 'cliches', 'conclusion', 'up', 'possibility', 'eventual', 'sequel', '*1/2', '4', 'stars']",The Amazing Spider-Man

1417834,A168KINQ59CZOZ,B004LWZWFQ,Josh B.,"[3, 5]","Spider-Man 3 sure left a bad taste in everyone's mouth, but I don't really think a full reboot was necessary only 5 years after Spider-Man 3's release. The studio had a script all set for Spider-Man 4 and they were set to start shooting it in February 2010 for a May 2011 release. Sam Raimi was set to direct again and Tobey Maguire would once again be brought back as the role of Peter Parker/Spider-Man. The whole thing started to fall apart weeks before shooting was going to take place. Sony, as they did in Spider-Man 3, was forcing their story and script onto Sam Raimi who wanted to go in a different direction than Sony. Ultimately Raimi decided to walk away from the project and Tobey and the rest of the cast followed suit. This is probably a good thing as I feel it would have been just as bad as a movie as Spider-Man 3. But, I would have liked to see Dylan Baker finally get to play the Lizard as Sony had promised him since day 1. Now, we'll never get to see his take on the character.Andrew Garfield was cast to play the new Peter Parker/Spider-Man and he does an excellent job with the story he was given. I think the story of The Amazing Spider-Man could have been a little better. But, this may come down to my own dislike of having to reboot the entire series. I think its pretty clear to me that I will always be a little upset about this. I just wish they could have waited at least 10 years in between the two series. While watching the movie I did say to myself a few times ""c'mon this feels just like Spider-Man 1 all over again"". But Garfield does a pretty good job with the character none the less.But I believe that Emma Stone steals this entire movie. She plays Peter's love interest Gwen Stacy. Emma is currently my favorite actress. Besides being extremely beautiful she is also an amazing actress. I expect her to win at least a couple of Academy Awards during her career. The character she plays is the character that Bryce Dallas Howard played in Spider-Man 3. They decided to not have Mary Jane Watson in this movie at all which is a pretty big departure from Spider-Man 1. I like this as this at least makes it feel less related to the other 3 movies.The Lizard/Dr. Curt Connors is the villain in this movie. I believe that they were planning to bring him into either Spider-Man 4 or 5 if they would have continued with those movies. He is played by Rhys Ifans who also does an excellent job with the character. I would have liked to see the Lizard look a little more 'lizard' like with a long snout but its okay. They did do some very nice C.G. effects with him anyways, so that was good.Other great additions were Martin Sheen and Sally Field who played Uncle Ben and Aunt May which they decided to make the characters a bit younger in this movie which I actually liked quite a bit. I know a lot of die-hard Spider-Man fans may not have liked this but I think it was an excellent choice.Also, Denis Leary plays Capt. Stacy in this movie. His character is a very serious character and Leary who is an excellent comedian does an excellent job here. I've seen him play some heavy roles before so I knew he could do it but luckily they did let the character have a little bit of humor to him which obviously Leary was great at.In this movie there is an absence of Harry and Norman Osbourn. Harry Osbourn is Pete's best friend and they decided not to bring him into this movie at all. This does make it feel quite a bit different than the other 3 movies as Harry is a pivotal role in them. Also, Norman Osbourn is not in this movie, he is only mentioned. He is the head of Oscorp which is the company that Dr. Connors works for. I'm assuming they will probably be introduced in the sequel. The more that they can change this series to differentiate it from the other, the better it will be for both series of films.Quite possibly my favorite new item added for this movie are Spider-Man's web shooters. They finally got this right. I could not stand this about the other films because it shows just how intelligent Peter has to be to be able to come up with a way to make his webbing. Any die-hard Spider-Man comic lover will tell you that the webbing does not just come out of his skin.The biggest dislike for me though had to be the amount of times Spider-Man takes his mask off. This was a huge problem for me in the previous series and it seems like they may be doing this all over again. I felt like shouting at the screen ""LEAVE YOUR MASK ON!!!!!!!!!"" I may be over exaggerating on this but at least they didn't make the character try to stop a train by putting his foot down in front of it (Spider-Man 2) because that was hilariously awful.The 3D in this movie was filmed with 3D cameras which means this is a native 3D film and not a converted 3D film. The 3D was pretty average throughout the movie especially in dialogue scenes. Scenes of Spider-Man swinging had better depth than the rest of the movie, especially the end during the crane swinging scene. There is a shot of Spider-Man which he comes swinging up out of the screen and then falls back into it. This is by far the coolest 3D shot in the film. This movie does not have a lot of pop outs unfortunately, but the 3D they do use gives the movie a more realistic sense of depth. But I would like to see more pop outs in the sequel.Overall I did like the movie, I suppose if I hadn't seen any of the other three I probably would have liked it a little more. There is still room for them to differentiate it from the other series and hopefully the sequels of this will do that well. There is also room for them to improve on in the story department and script as well. I felt this movie was a little teeny-bopper at times which hurt some of the scenes in my opinion.I had doubts about Garfield because I have never seen him in any movie before this but again I think he does a pretty good job. I have no problems with him returning for more Spider-Man films. I just hope that the studio gets it through their heads to LEAVE SPIDER-MAN'S MASK ON!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Other than that you should definitely check this movie out just for the visual effects alone because they are pretty Amazing (See what I did there? Amazing Spider-Man? Get it? Yeah I know its stupid.

Well like when they rebooted batman with the dark knight trilogy I was very skeptical. But like when I first saw batman begins, I wait to see how the movie is and what direction they take with the amazing spiderman. Well they keep a lot of the classic spiderman things they had in the original spiderman movies but had new things you have never seen in a spiderman movies. Like new villains like the classic Lizard which spiderman has some amazing fight scenes with. But the whole plot is building to a bigger plot not explore in the first set of movies. A more complex story line and greater villains. Having both greater emotion and a darker vibe but also having a updated vive but still having the classic spiderman vibe the first set of movies didn't have. The more I watch this movie the more I have grown to love it more than the first trilogy. Andrew is a awesome spiderman and more believable at times. I think its going to be a better set of movies than the first one day with now seeing the amazing spiderman 2 which I think was the best spiderman movie ever.

1417837,A2R1YK3THA0RB3,B004LWZWFQ,Josh,"[3, 4]","I want to start this review by acknowleging the fact that I did enjoy Sam Raimi's take on Spider-Man. I, like many was one of the fellow fans that expected a Spider Man 4 as a continiuation to the series. I like many was caught completely off guard when the announcement was made that the sereies was going to be rebooted; as a matter of fact, I was angry. I decided that nonetheless, I was going to see if Sony could make a better Spider-Man. I said, ""this is a movie I am either going to like or completely hate."" And after multiple viewings, plus a blu-ray purchase later, the consensus is: I hate that I like this movie so much.Starring Andrew Garfield as Peter Parker/Spider- Man, The amazing Spider-Man tells the origin story of how Peter Parker came to become the famed web-slinger. While this movie does NOT (spoiler) include Uncle Ben's infamous advice he gives to Peter about responsibility, the story (unlike Sam Raimi's films) revolves primarily around Peter's parents, specifically his father. Actually, the film starts out when Peter is still quite young. The story is not quite suspensful or thrilling, but it has a balanced even tone of humor; more notably the humorous side of Spider-Man is present in the movie.Another likable aspect in the movie is the chemistry between Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone (Gwen Stacy) in the movie. Peter is as we all know the guy that is easily bullied and unpopular, but has a particularly brilliant thinking mind when it comes to science, Gwen is easy on the eyes and the girl every guy admires and dreams about, and in The Amazing Spider Man its Peter's smarts (and his courage early on) that sets him apart from the rest. The chemistry between these two helps the movie in more ways than none.This movie is not without its cons, many of which I was able to overlook and forget about, but a few worth mentioning. Rhys Ifans stars as Dr. Connors. And for you familar Spider-Man fans, we all know what character Dr. Connors transforms into. Unfortunately his take on the villain he portrays is not as menacing or memorable as it should be and the CGI is well.....eh but oh well. Now as my headline said this Spider Man movie feels a lot darker compared to the prievious Spider Man movies. Among the common complaints from a few of my fellow colleagues that watched this movie, the most common one was that this movie copied the original Spider Man movie or that it felt too modernized. I do feel that some things were borrowed from the orginal, but I do not feel it is a big enough probblem to be worrried about. Flaws in The Amazing Spider-Man? Sure. Is it still a good movie? Yes it is.All that aside, The Amazing Spider-Man is creative; be it that it is also really exceptional (and I mean unconventionally Exceptional). It has its faults, but overall it holds its ground well as a start for the new series.3.5 starsSupporting Cast: Martin Sheen, Sally Field, Dennis Leary, Irrfan Khan",4,"A Reboot that offers a darker, more detailed look into the world of Peter Parker",1383609600,"11 5, 2013",2013,2939,"['want', 'start', 'review', 'acknowleging', 'fact', 'did', 'enjoy', 'Sam', 'Raimi', 'take', 'Spider-Man', 'many', 'was', 'one', 'fellow', 'fans', 'expected', 'Spider', 'Man', '4', 'continiuation', 'series', 'like', 'many', 'was', 'caught', 'completely', 'guard', 'when', 'announcement', 'was', 'made', 'sereies', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'rebooted', 'matter', 'fact', 'was', 'angry', 'decided', 'nonetheless', 'was', 'going', 'see', 'Sony', 'could', 'make', 'better', 'Spider-Man', 'said', 'movie', 'am', 'either', 'going', 'like', 'completely', 'hate', 'multiple', 'viewings', 'blu-ray', 'purchase', 'later', 'consensus', 'hate', 'like', 'movie', 'so', 'much.Starring', 'Andrew', 'Garfield', 'Peter', 'Parker/Spider-', 'Man', 'amazing', 'Spider-Man', 'origin', 'story', 'how', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'came', 'become', 'famed', 'web-slinger', 'movie', 'NOT', 'spoiler', 'include', 'Uncle', 'Ben', 'infamous', 'advice', 'Peter', 'responsibility', 'story', 'Sam', 'Raimi', 'films', 'primarily', 'Peter', 'parents', 'specifically', 'father', 'Actually', 'film', 'out', 'when', 'Peter', 'still', 'quite', 'young', 'story', 'not', 'quite', 'suspensful', 'thrilling', 'balanced', 'even', 'tone', 'humor', 'more', 'notably', 'humorous', 'side', 'Spider-Man', 'present', 'movie.Another', 'likable', 'aspect', 'movie', 'chemistry', 'Andrew', 'Garfield', 'Emma', 'Stone', 'Gwen', 'Stacy', 'movie', 'Peter', 'know', 'guy', 'easily', 'bullied', 'unpopular', 'particularly', 'brilliant', 'thinking', 'mind', 'when', 'science', 'Gwen', 'easy', 'eyes', 'girl', 'guy', 'admires', 'dreams', 'Amazing', 'Spider', 'Man', 'Peter', 'smarts', 'courage', 'early', 'apart', 'rest', 'chemistry', 'two', 'movie', 'more', 'ways', 'none.This', 'movie', 'not', 'cons', 'many', 'was', 'able', 'overlook', 'forget', 'about', 'few', 'worth', 'mentioning', 'Rhys', 'Ifans', 'Dr.', 'Connors', 'familar', 'Spider-Man', 'fans', 'know', 'what', 'character', 'Dr.', 'Connors', 'Unfortunately', 'take', 'villain', 'not', 'menacing', 'memorable', 'should', 'be', 'CGI', 'well', '..eh', 'oh', 'well', 'Now', 'headline', 'said', 'Spider', 'Man', 'movie', 'lot', 'darker', 'compared', 'prievious', 'Spider', 'Man', 'movies', 'common', 'complaints', 'few', 'fellow', 'colleagues', 'watched', 'movie', 'most', 'common', 'one', 'was', 'movie', 'copied', 'original', 'Spider', 'Man', 'movie', 'felt', 'too', 'modernized', 'do', 'feel', 'things', 'were', 'borrowed', 'orginal', 'do', 'not', 'feel', 'big', 'enough', 'probblem', 'be', 'worrried', 'Flaws', 'Amazing', 'Spider-Man', 'Sure', 'still', 'good', 'movie', 'Yes', 'aside', 'Amazing', 'Spider-Man', 'creative', 'be', 'also', 'really', 'exceptional', 'mean', 'unconventionally', 'Exceptional', 'faults', 'overall', 'ground', 'well', 'start', 'new', 'series.3.5', 'starsSupporting', 'Cast', 'Martin', 'Sheen', 'Sally', 'Field', 'Dennis', 'Leary', 'Irrfan', 'Khan']",The Amazing Spider-Man

1417839,A32IDF7JFAPXAG,B004LWZWFQ,"Joshua Glowzinski ""Gman""","[0, 0]","May be spoilers below.I saw the original Spider-Man in the Theater.  I really liked it.  I have the set of all three movies.  They are fun movies you can watch again and again.I had told people that this was just a remake and would never be as good as the original movie (insert foot in mouth.)  As shocked as I am, I actually liked this new version a lot more than the original.  I will explain why below.First, this movie is set at a much faster pace than the original.  You do not see him going to the fighting place and trying out his moves.  He just gets his powers and starts stopping the bad guys.  He does see what he can do.  But it is not as drug on in this new version.What he can do is available differently.  In the original, it was all from the spider.  In the new movie, why he does get his power from said spider, he seems to invent some of the stuff as well.  It makes it almost seem more like destiny than fate.  He just seems to fit in with his new power and have the ability and knowledge to make it better.The characters are different as well.  The Spider-Man character, I like this version better than the original.  He has that intelligent, quiet guy thing down.  He just seemed more like the guy that would turn into Spider-Man than the original guy did.  He does not have a job working for the paper.  He takes pictures for his school.  In this movie, instead of having his boss as a supporting character, the supporting character is the father of his girlfriend, who just so happens to be a police officer.  I believe he is the guy in charge.  Important things happen with this new character.  Something that he tells the boy towards the end and what the boy says at the very end, while arriving to class late, gave me such a cool, warm feeling.  It was incredible.His aunt and uncle seem different.  His uncle seems angrier than the original did.  But, you get the feeling that he really loved him.The girlfriend.  Well, in the original, she seemed somewhat lonely.  Her father was abusive, be in mentally or physically, I believe mentally.  But as I said, her father is a cop.  She seems like she has friends, but that she is smarter and more sophisticated than them.  She seems to be a good person who goes for what she wants.  The girl who played her, wow, she is one of the most beautiful humans I have ever seen.  She is incredible.The villain.  Now, I cannot really remember the villain from the original.  But, in this version, he is a man who has an injury.  He is looking for a way to help other with injuries or sickness.  Things happen.  He does not want to give the stuff to a man, because he does not think it is ready.  He tries it on himself.  It takes him over.  You really get the feeling that you understand the man.  He is trying to do good, but thanks to fate, things get out of hand and he looses control.I am not sure when Peters friend came into the original movies.  But, he really does not have a male friend in this movie.  The girl seems to be his real friend.As I said, I like the originals.  But I just feel this version is better.  It has a faster pace.  It seems to see the story in a different way.  While some of the same things happen, the way they happen is just better.  You really feel like the characters fit their roles.  This is a lot more action than the original.  It has been at least ten years since I have been so excited to see the next movie in a franchise.  I just pre ordered the special edition from Amazon for $99.99.  I cannot wait to see it.  I suggest you see both versions of the movie, but, what the originals first.  Once you see this new version, the old ones will probably move much to slow for you.I almost forgot, there seems to be a mystery about his parents going on.

1417844,AWOY8WPL84PIB,B004LWZWFQ,JP Fish,"[2, 11]","This note is a review of a review.  Review #1 needs a SPOILER ALERT!I have not seen this film. But as an original Merry Marvel Marcher I am pretty sure I will have a good time with it. The Rammi films have all been true enough to the character and concept that the series has been among the most enjoyable of the Marvel features. No surprise in that Spiderman is the most successful of the entire Marvel super hero pantheon.Hence,a top rating on an unseen film.This is WARNING to all readers about the over written, first review on this page. Probably too late, right? None the less,future writers, take this as literary advise on courtesy if nothing else.SPOILER ALERT!!!!  DO NOT BLINDLY READ THE OPENING REVIEW IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THE MOVIE.After the First paragraph, skip to the Last paragraph. Everything in between has very little to say other than to expound on all the major plot points of the movie. Granted, comic book movie stories lack the subtle twists and turns of a Hitchcock or an Agatha Christi. But giving a blow by blow account of every major act in the film is not a review. At best, it is only an expo on the story line. Nothing more.So, for better or worse, if all a writer can do is say "" I have seen this movie! This is what happened in it, start to finish. And this is what I think of each of these actions"", well, shut up! That is not a review in any sense. It is a Critique, something to be read AFTER seeing the film. Not Before!A good writer can address the qualities of a film without simply telling the story line. In fact, that is the real function of a review! To give insight into the merits of a given film. Not to retell the story.I will never forget the experience of having a ""friend"" who had read the book tell me that Darth Vader is Luke's father the day before the film's premier. I said nothing to the rest of my family. But for me, the dramatic impact was completely ruined by one inconsiderate person!So, a note to all you blabber mouths out there. Put a lid on it until some time after the DVD is released! Or post the label SPOILER ALERT at the heading of your review. Telling everything you have seen in a film is not smart,or clever. It is just lazy,arrogant,shallow,empty exposition. It is the kind of thing people write when they really don't have anything original to say. Do us all a favor. This is not some school assignment where you have pages to fill. If you cannot do any better than simply retelling the story,leave your keyboard alone! We want to SEE the movie for it's own sake. Not have the experience cluttered up with unwelcome information. How many people would watch a whole baseball game if they knew who won? Get my point yet?There are people who do NOT need their minds made up for them!'nuff said.

1417845,ADCC3WHSZNW1R,B004LWZWFQ,J. Richardson,"[1, 3]","Note: May contain spoilers. Proceed with caution.When doing reviews on reboots it's easy to just compare and contrast on the original film(s), but I will try my best to refrain from doing that too much. However there will be time where a comparison is necessary. With that being said, let's get started. The film was, for lack of a better word, amazing. I was so skeptical when I heard about the reboot, simply because I had become so comfortable with Tobey Maguire. Now he was never the perfect Peter Parker, but I still enjoyed the original trilogy. However just like the original trilogy, this film does have both it's strengths and weaknesses.Let's start with the Spider-Man costume and the Spider-Man character (not Peter) From the start I did not like the new costume. It looked really weird, and it did not properly portray how Spider-Man should look in my eyes. Sadly after seeing the film my opinion wasn't changed. One thing I did love about this new film is they implemented Spider-Man's web shooters. This is a very important component in the comics because during fights he would sometimes run out of web and he would have to strategically get himself out of a situation. Now they didn't go too in depth with the shooters, but I felt this was a step in the right direction. Then the use of his webbing is focused on a lot more in this film than it was in the original trilogy. He uses his web constantly during his fight sequences, which is another very important component to the Spider-Man character. Hopefully in the next film they can implement the humor he uses during his fights. In the comics he likes to taunt his opponents, but this still hasn't been explored in a Spider-Man film.I didn't really like Andrew Garfield's portrayal of Peter Parker. Peter is suppose to be this awkward kid who has no athletic skills at all, but in the film he was standing up for a kid getting beat up (before he got bit) and riding a skateboard. I don't know. It didn't ruin the film, but it did bug me a little. What bugged me more is how often he took his mask off as Spider-Man. There had to be like 10 people in the film who found out who he was, this irritated the hell out of me. In the comics he made it so important that no one ever knew who he was. That way when someone did find out, it was a big deal. Other than that I felt he did an amazing job, except in the scene with Uncle Ben. It seemed really awkward and forced, which kind of took me out of the moment.Emma Stone did an amazing job as Gwen Stacey. I was a little worried because I had never seen her in a film like this, but she didn't disappoint. I love the way the writers showed the relationship between Gwen and Peter. It was something that was never truly discussed in the original trilogy, but still a very important part of the comic books. The chemistry between Andrew and Emma was phenomenal, and I personally felt their best scenes where when they were together.Rhys Ifans played an amazing Curt Connors. I felt he looked more like Connors then Dylan Baker did in the original trilogy. The only thing that kind of bothered me was you constantly saw the stubble of his arm. I always imagined the character being self-conscious about it, making sure his shirt hung long enough to conceal it. It wasn't a big deal, just a minor gripe.Martin Sheen played a surprisingly amazing Uncle Ben. When I heard about his role I couldn't see him fitting the part, but he made it work. However I didn't enjoy Sally Field as Aunt May. I always envisioned her as an old frail woman, but she just didn't give me that feeling. Her best scene was her last scene. I felt that scene embodied everything that Aunt May was in Peter's life.I would've like to see Harry Osborn and Mary Jane in here. Harry was Peter's best friend in high school, but they completely left him out of the film. I understand they were trying to focus on Peter and Gwen's relationship, but May Jane was still his crush. The girl next door.Visually the film is amazing. I felt the Lizard looked great, and I understand what the director was going for by giving him more of a human face instead of that of a reptile. I saw one reviewer complain that they used too much CGI with him, well how the hell do you expect them not to use CGI for a huge Lizard? The only thing I can complain about visually is the point of view shots. Those seemed really weird and out of place, but again nothing that ruined the film.It was weird not hearing Danny Elfman doing the score, but I adjusted. I felt James Horner's wasn't as strong, but it did have it's strong points. The licensed music was done well, but there were very few songs in the film so I don't think a soundtrack is being released.Overall Score: 8.5/10 - This review came out longer than expected, but I thank you if you read it in its entirety. I loved the film and, in many ways, I felt it did a lot of things better than the originals. It was nice seeing a new take on the origin story instead of them rehashing the same idea. They did leave it open for a sequel and, if I remember correctly, it is planned for a 2014 release. Whether you're a fan of comics or just good movies, I recommend you go and see this.",4,8.5/10 - Great,1353715200,"11 24, 2012",2012,5199,"['Note', 'May', 'contain', 'spoilers', 'Proceed',

Recruiting Andrew Garfield as the star, the plot is more faithful to the source material; Spidey gets his trusty web shooters and his first girl Gwen Stacy (played by Emma Stone), and the script ties in the legacy of Peter Parker's parents with scientist Curt Conner's transformation into the Lizard in a attempt to regrow his right arm.  Biased publisher J. Jonah Jameson and his Daily Bugle newspaper aren't mentioned beyond a front-page headline.  But really, who needs J.J. when you've got Denis Leary as the police chief determined to squash the wall-crawler?  And what Marvel movie would be complete without ""The Man"" himself, Stan Lee, blessing it with a cameo.While Garfield's witty, yet awkward Peter fits the bill, Tobey Maguire didn't stutter nearly as much.  It is pleasing to see this Peter learning the whole ""power and responsibility"" bit without Uncle Ben spelling it out for him.  Everything else is bundled up in a nice bag of synthetic webbing.

High School is a far more chaotic hence difficult environment to develop the story of a lonely skate boarding nerd as the film rushed head long into the powers phase a bit too quickly.

""The Amazing Spiderman"" feels more satisfying in the way of character and plot. The characters feel fuller and more thought out and the plot more filled out.""The Amazing Spiderman"" covers some familiar territory, the origin story of Spiderman, from Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) high school science nerd, photographer and punching bag. This Spiderman ventures a bit into what happened to Peter's parents and why he's living with Uncle Ben (Martin Sheen) and Aunt May (Sally Field), at first the family history of Peter's father being a scientist studying spiders and secret formulas gave me a bad feeling, the 2003 Ang Lee, Eric Bana, ""The Hulk"" bad, but those fears soon melted away as it was apparent ""The Amazing Spiderman"" wasn't going to make those same mistakes. ""The Amazing Spiderman"" does stay close to the outline of the Spiderman origin story, Peter Parker while visiting the laboratory at Oscorp is bitten by a genetically altered spider (changed from the atomically enhanced spider of the 60's, splicing genes from species to species is the new bug-a-boo), in the course of discovering his powers inadvertently causes the death of Uncle Ben by failing to stop a criminal.Gone as the love interest is Peter's neighbor and unrequited love of MJ, replaced with Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone) who is as into Peter as he is into her, however awkward it may be. The relationship between Peter and Gwen feels a little more red blooded than Maquire's Peter and Kirsten Dunst's MJ, it may just be that Garfield/Stone have better chemistry than Maquire/Dunst, the relationship feels a little more natural.The learning curve for Peter discovering his powers seems a little steeper than in earlier ""Spiderman's"" it seems there's more trial and error in the accumulations of powers and like the original cartoon Spiderman, Peter has to fashion his own webbing from his chemistry set.Another carry over from other ""Spiderman's"" and other superhero movies in general, the superhero has a hand in creating his nemesis and Peter hands over a formula to Dr. Curt Connors (Rhys Ifans) that creates The Lizard. Also from past ""Spiderman's"" is the theme of responsibility that comes with having powers (called talents in this go round) and this Spiderman has consequences, Peter keeps going home to Aunt May all beat up and has to come up with reasons why he's so beat up. He takes it seriously that he has to stop Connors even when Spiderman's powers and abilities may be outmatched by The Lizard's brute strength.""The Amazing Spiderman"" is a darker Spiderman than we've seen before and that was another reason of concern, after all Batman was built for a dark Freudian tone while Spiderman isn't necessarily, look what happened when Spiderman went to the dark side in ""Spiderman 3"" it felt like unintended satire,  And to say nothing of ""Superman 3,"" maybe it's the third installment in a series that lends itself to going back to cartoon origins, that was the downfall of the Tim Burton's ""Batman"" movies, they relied more and more of the cartoon in tone.It was also good to see good actors and acting in the supporting cast, up front is Dennis Leary as Captain Stacy, Campbell Scott as Peter Parker's flashback father, and C.

I thought it was odd that there was another Spider-Man being made with another actor so soon, yet I couldn't help but enjoy watching this.  It's a little darker and more dramatic than the Tobey Maguire series.  This one takes a lot longer for Peter Parker to transition into Spider-Man, but I didn't mind the actual build of the story and getting to know who he is beforehand.  We actually get a glimpse of who is parents were.  His Aunt and Uncle who take him in are more realistic than the ones in the previous Spider-Man's.  This movie in general was more realistic in that it seemed to be focused on what would happen if someone really did turn into Spider-Man.  The two leads, Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone, are actually in their late 20's and yet they play High School teens, but hey it seems to work.  There is no Mary Jane, but there is a Gwen played by Emma Stone.  Gwen is much stronger and more hands on than Mary Jane who is more on the meeker, naive side waiting to be saved.  Gwen dives right in and does it herself and even helps Spider-Man in fighting the bad guy and in saving the world.  This update probably needed to be made to ad in our heavy use of cell phones these days.  This was better than Spider-Man 3 and maybe even Spider-Man 1, but Spider-Man 2 still holds the crown.

1417893,A3KTWY04ET3VRT,B004LWZWFQ,"K. Q. Jackson ""FallenMarvel""","[1, 2]","I felt this movie was a good contribution to the Spider-Man brand. It's not the best and not necessarily anything new, but otherwise I felt it was worth the price of admission. I'm gonna break this review down as much as possible with comparisions and improvements to the original trilogy. At the end of the day I would love it if Marvel Studios acquired the filming rights back for Spider-Man, but instead this is what we have so I'm going by my interpretation since Sony wants to hold onto their cash cow.Cast:First, I have to point out the casting was great. Andrew Garfield as Peter Parker was nothing short of genius. Martin Sheen as Ben Parker was handled well and we had enough time to really get to know him and what he meant to the other characters. Sally Field as Mae Parker was nice as well. I definitely commend Raimi for portraying her image exactly as in the comic, but I do have to say I don't really prefer the old and frail Aunt May so my kudos to Marc Webb. Dennis Leary as Captain Stacy was great as well. Emma Stone as Gwen did a good job and Rhys Ifans as Curt Connors was just fantastic. I really commend them for the casting this go round. Everyone seemed to fit into their roles pretty well.Story:As far as the plot goes, it's not something relatively new except for the back story of Peter's parents and an obvious link to Oscorp which I found interesting. So there's that element of a kid who is raised by his relatives, but longing for knowledge of his parents. The only link to information about his parents is Dr. Curt Connors (Lizard) who currently works for Oscorp. The way the plot played out to every action there was a plausible reaction. The way he got his powers made more sense and his transition from vigilante into his calling as a hero made more sense. Overall the story isn't some new style. It's a basic formula, but it has a better focus which doesn't jump all over the place. You should be able to follow it with no problem. My only problem is I felt his Peter's parents should have remained the focus since that was the primary focal point of the film to begin with. Not saying it wasn't important, but I felt it should have stayed a driving force to Peter's character on top of everything else.Action:In classic Spidey fashion, the action was great as you would expect. One difference I see is that they really utilized the stuntpeople as much as possible without heavily resorting to CGI through every scene (unless Lizard is involved). There was a sense of balance with stuntpeople and CGI which I felt was great. When it was necessary to use CGI it was and vice versa with stunt pros.Nerd Comparison:Now I'm not going to rant about how I hated Spider-Man 3. Been there, done that. This is just an overall comparison. Raimi's films set a standard and were great for what they were at the time. They were campy, fun and just different than what we were used to. I feel Webb just took the same formula and made some improvements (mainly with the character development and story focus). I have nothing against Toby Maguire. I think he's a good actor. Toby as Peter Parker was definitely a send up to the Amazing Fantasy comics of old which I can commend the production team for, but in this day and age he's not the type of person everyone can really relate to. We can't help, but see Toby as Peter Parker because he was the first in a major film to play the rold and no one else at the time could fill it. I do think he was good, but he wasn't great. I recently watched Spider-Man 2 again and I must say I didn't like how the characters were portrayed, except Jameson. Peter's personality was always dry, mostly depressed and he was constantly obsessed with Mary Jane to the point where it's comical. I felt Webb's portrayal of Peter was more involved. You really feel for him as things happens in his life. I'm glad they fully showcased Peter's genius level intellect to its full potential by watching him invent the web shooters and his ""think tank"" moments with Connors as well as on his own. We really got a chance to see how really smart he was in this movie which I feel the Raimi films lacked. He threw out a few big words here and there, but that was it. Also, I love having the wisecracking Spidey in this movie. It's something I felt vastly missing in the previous trilogy. In the original trilogy, Spidey had 3 to 5 wisecracks maximum which left it as just an over the top action scene. Garfield greatly portrayed an awkward teen trying to find his place in the world and his entire world didn't revolve around the love interest like the original trilogy. In Raimi's films whenever Peter and MJ were on screen it was always an awkward situation and felt forced. It just didn't meld well to me.Overall:I feel this movie was a good addition and I feel that it was a more stable installment for it to build into a stronger franchise. I know many don't feel that way, but I feel this is a gem waiting to be polished. The only drawback is that emphasis on Peter's parents seemed to be done more in the trailers than in the actual film. I felt that was misleading. Raimi's films set the bar for it's time and I don't think it took itself too seriously in the beginning. Although I do feel it's a shame to have to start over again after looking at the material I can see why it felt necessary. I feel The Amazing Spider-Man is as true to source material of today. It's entertaining, fun, and treated with respect.",4,Breakdown - Good & Possibly Necessary,1348099200,"09 20, 2012",2012,5463,"['felt', 'movie', 'was', 'good', 'contribution', 'Spider-Man', 'brand',

This is how the story goes: Peter Parker, an outcast high schooler who was abandoned by his parents as a boy, leaving him to be raised by his Uncle Ben and Aunt May. Like most teenagers, Peter is trying to figure out who he is and how he got to be the person he is today. Peter is also finding his way with his first high school crush, Gwen Stacy, and together, they struggle with love, commitment, and secrets. As Peter discovers a mysterious briefcase that belonged to his father, he begins a quest to understand his parents' disappearance -- leading him directly to Oscorp and the lab of Dr. Curt Connors, his father's former partner. As Spider-Man is set on a collision course with Connors' alter-ego, The Lizard, Peter will make life-altering choices to use his powers and shape his destiny to become a hero.The cast led by Andrew Garfield (as Peter Parker / Spider-Man), Emma Stone (as Gwen Stacy), Rhys Ifans (as Dr. Curt Connors / The Lizard), Denis Leary (as Captain Stacy), Martin Sheen (as Uncle Ben) & Sally Field (as Aunt May) is excellent.

1417903,A39675KXEV8UK8,B004LWZWFQ,Kyle Shultz,"[414, 504]","I read a lot of reviews for this movie before watching it myself. In the end, they all boiled down to a few basic criticisms, which I kept in mind as I made my own appraisal. Here are the major problems people seem to have had with Marc Webb's ""Amazing Spider-Man"", along with my responses.1. The reboot was too soon.This more or less depends on your point of view. True, the last Spidey movie was in 2007, a mere five years ago - more than long enough to warrant another Spider-Man film; not exactly long enough to call for a complete reboot. On the other hand, I think a lot of people would agree that it's been more like eight years since the last GOOD Spider-Man film. I loved Raimi's work with the character, though I do criticize him on some minor points. But in the end, he really dropped the ball with Spider-Man 3, running a lot of good characters into the ground and painting himself into a corner with two hours of very messy plotting. In the end, whether a reboot was necessary per se is a matter of personal preference. But even if you think it wasn't necessary, is it fair to write off the new movie completely as a result? I don't believe it is.2. We've heard it all before.Yes and no. This is another interpretation of Spider-Man's origin story. But it's very different from Raimi's first Spider-Man film. More importantly, it's a well-done interpretation. At the heart of this ""origin story"" is Peter Parker's development from a somewhat geeky, trouble-making teen into a true hero. This transition happened far more quickly in Raimi's first movie, mainly because Maguire's Peter had a more strongly-developed moral compass to begin with. Neither version is objectively inferior in my opinion, but I do have a personal preference for the deep character drama achieved by Webb. The point is, yes, this is the spider-bite story again, but it's a good spider-bite story.3. The hype about ""secrets being revealed"" was a big lie.Yes, it was. This is most definitely not ""the untold story"". Significant-sounding lines from the trailers such as ""Do you think what happened to you was an accident?"" and ""If you want the truth about your parents, Peter, then come and get it"" didn't even feature, which I'll admit kind of annoyed me. That amounts to false advertising in my opinion. I was very happy with what I got, but it wasn't what I was promised. The thing is, there is some big mystery going on in this movie with Peter's parents. However, their story doesn't feature very heavily in this first movie. The elements of it that do were given away in the trailers. So don't bother watching this solely to find out more about Richard and Mary Parker. Their story will have to wait until the sequel.4. The villain was weak.My main problem with this film's take on Dr. Curtis Connors was that it diverged so heavily from the comics. The Connors I remember was an intriguing villain because he was a father and a husband who transformed himself into a monster in a quest for healing. Billy Connors and his mom aren't around here. Instead there's a bachelor, British-accented Connors who frequently runs the risk of going boldly where so many villains have gone before. Fortunately, Rhys Ifans' performance is good enough to prevent this happening most of the time. Connors' motivation makes sense overall, though little time is given to truly flesh it out. Perhaps if his mysterious connections to Norman Osborn had been explored in greater detail, he would have been more memorable.5. The Lizard's design was flawed.Most people who didn't care for the Lizard's look seem to describe it as ""too human"". The face certainly is. It wasn't really that scary. I've seen alternate designs which the production team ultimately abandoned which I think would have been a lot better. So basically I would agree with this criticism, but for me it was a minor quibble.6. It had too much teenage angst and Twilight-esque drama.Actually, it had none. The teenage interactions were more mature than I'm used to seeing in film or TV, with even Flash Thompson evolving from a typical bully into a likable character over time. There are a few moments of stereotypical rebellion from Peter, but they lead rapidly into the tragic events that change him, so they're quickly forgotten. Despite the early publicity saying that this movie would be ""darker"", I don't think I'd describe it that way. It's a little less cheesy and a little more gritty in parts, but there are enough moments of clever humor to give the viewer a break from the gradually building tension.The Amazing Spider-Man does have flaws. But in my opinion, its good points are so good that they cancel out the missteps. Andrew Garfield brings the wisecracking, geeky, sometimes mischievous Peter Parker from the original comics to life better than anyone I've seen (or heard, in animation) thus far. He nails the sense of humor that was frequently lacking from Maguire's Spidey. I had my doubts about Emma Stone as Gwen, but her acting was superb as well. She and Garfield have great chemistry on screen, which bodes well for the future. Really all the main cast was terrific, but I must make a special mention of Dennis Leary's Captain Stacy. He truly did a fantastic job. The special effects in regard to Spider-Man's web-slinging and other stunts were breathtaking, and clever cinematography draws the audience into the action effortlessly. The music was forgettable for the most part, but served its purpose in the more dramatic scenes (much like the soundtrack to The Avengers).In short, watching this movie was a delight for me as a long-time Spider-Fan, even with the memory of Raimi's better efforts fresh in my mind, and I'm very much looking forward to the sequel (teased at the end of this movie by an intriguing mid-credits scene). Worth buying, worth watching, and worth re-watching. It's a fun, engaging superhero film, and deserves to be judged on its own merits, which are considerable. Please don't let the unfair amount of negativity surrounding this movie scare you away from it. If you give it a chance, you won't be sorry.",5,The Amazing Spider-Man - point by point,1352073600,"11 5, 2012",2012,6095,"['read', 'lot', 'reviews', 'movie', 'watching', 'end', 'boiled', 'down',

1417918,A2E58CS41V9KS6,B004LWZWFQ,"Little Known Blogger ""Conservative blogger.""","[0, 3]","There were some good points to this movie: I like that they minimized the traditional Hollywood ""trying to figure out his powers"" silliness.  I like that Parker developed his own web-slingers, as in the source material.  The action scenes were also quite good. However, there are some bad parts, too.One of the reasons that I watched this movie was an article I read in a sci-fi magazine, where it was mentioned that the director and actors were chosen specifically to show the more human side of the superhero.  They failed abysmally.  While the ""witty"" Spider-Man dialogue during the action scenes was passable, the dialogue of Peter Parker himself--especially with the female lead--was horrible, and slow to the point of being agonizing.  I could really, REALLY have done without the ""Spider-Man is the result of a SECRET CONSPIRACY his father was invovled in!!!"" nonsense.  Hollywood needs to just erase anything involving ""conspiracy"" from their production list for about 20 years.  A far more interesting angle to play would have been to spend more time examining the villain's drive to FORCIBLY IMPROVE the human race.  I think that could be used to say quite a bit about our current society.The supporting cast was badly-chosen; obviously they were there to put some name power in the production, rather than for their ability to portray the actual characters (this was one of the stronger features of the last series of Spider-Man movies).  Speaking of the last series, it's really not that old.  Another bit from the article I read mentioned that ""these stories can be told over and over again""--why not just tell it ONCE, and do it right?  Nobody is re-making Citizen Kane (yet...  don't even think about it, Hollywood).  I'd much prefer an ongoing series, where the character develops (as the Avengers project seems to be).  Perhaps someday Hollywood will remember how to write about heroes, and we can see the stories of mature characters who act like adults... rather than the constant jumble of anti-heroes and bungling newbies.All in all, I enjoyed watching it...

1417919,AX9C10JD538D9,B004LWZWFQ,Liviania,"[4, 7]","This year brought about a reboot of the Spider-Man cinematic universe.  The Amazing Spider-Man met with surprisingly good reviews, enough to convince me to see it. But I'm not totally in love with it.First, let's talk Tobey Maguire versus Andrew Garfield.  Everyone told me Garfield is so much more convincing as nerdy Peter Parker . . . but I don't see it.  The first time we see Garfield's Peter in school, he's got perfectly puffed hair, contacts, a skateboard, and a hoodie.  He stands tall.  He looks cool.  The first time we see Maguire's Peter, he's chasing after a bus and being laughed at because his clothes and glasses may not totally hide that Maguire is a movie star, but he's at least acting lame.Spider-man I'll give Garfield this: he got to dish out more of Peter's signature terrible humor.  But his delivery need work - the timing of the jokes felt rushed to me.  Meanwhile, Maguire trying to figure out how his webbing works is still a classic bit of physical comedy.The girls are pretty even.  Emma Stone is perfect for Gwen Stacy; Kirsten Dunst is a perfect Mary Jane Watson.  But the thin ponytail and thick bangs that are Stacy's expected look are terrible for Stone.  She looked best in the scenes where they let her hair be down and wavy - they should've just let her look nice instead of trying to conform to strongly to the comics look.And look, I love Sally Field and Martin Sheen.  But they were terrible as Aunt May and Uncle Ben.  Sheen's Ben was a scold and Field's May was a doormat.  And look, Aunt May might be old, but that woman is firm.  She's one of the best parents in any comic book universe, not a woman with no control over her household.I'm not even going to bring up direction.  Sam Raimi crushes Marc Webb.  Webb's scenes of Peter slinging through the city look like everything that's been done before.  Raimi's felt fun.As for mythology choices, I understand that The Amazing Spider-Man wanted to be different from Spider-Man.  People have complained for years about Peter's web-shooters being organic, so making them once more his invention could've been a good move.  But the organic webbing simplified the story in Spider-Man.  The large order of Oscorp webbing had to look suspicious.  And it just felt wrong without Uncle Ben saying, ""With great power comes great responsibility.""  Maybe they could've had him say the original ""With great power there must also come -- great responsibility!"" instead of dancing around it?Plot-wise, I liked that Peter was a little more free with his secret identity.  Keeping it super secret damaged his relationships in the original movie trilogy.  But there has to be a happy medium - I felt like almost every character knew who Spider-Man really was by the end of the film.  Saving Norman Osborn for a later movie was probably a good move - it helps differentiate the movies and allows for a bigger, more recognizable bad guy to come along in a later entry in the series.  But Rhys Ifans, who I usually find hilarious, wasn't the best fit for the villain.  Perhaps no one would be because the guy is just that grating.  Osborn at least has some charisma, and Willem Defoe did an amazing job of playing two personalities.

1417922,A2W00XKTTF1G0Z,B004LWZWFQ,"Lorenzo M. in the Hollywood CA Area ""Movie Wa...","[9, 17]","MOVIE REVIEW #42: "" The Amazing Spider-Man ""Wow...this is one reboot that's energized with a lot of action, suspense and feeling. Director Marc Webb (500 Days of Summer, Green Day Videos) did a great job in giving everyone in the audience a roller coaster ride of fun and energy. I didn't know what to expect - having the previous series of films ahead of this - but I think the franchise is in good hands.The most impressive cast member is British actor (although born in Los Angeles but grew up in England) was Andrew Garfield (The Social Network, Doctor Who). His emotional range and angst for his parents, Uncle and his sweetheart....in relation to the super-human activities happening around him made the whole movie real for me. Riveting and passionate was Garfield and he has the acting chops to stand up and hold his own against some great talent in the film.Now with cast like Sally Feld (Norma Ray, Brother & Sisters) as the compassionate and heartfelt Aunt May and Martin Sheen (Apocalypse Now, West Wing) as the very caring and father-figure-like Uncle Ben to the believable and driven performance of Dennis Leary (Rescue Me, Ice Age) and the Police Chief of New York who comes the realization the hard way the man in the red and blue spandex is not the enemy. Sally and Martin are amazing together and even more poignant when they're one-on-one with Garfield.Throw in a believable teen romance with the smart minded Emma Stone (The Help, Zombieland) and now drop in a dabble of a highly-motivated super villain played by Rhys Iris (Notting Hill, Anonymous) and you a great two-hour ride with an origin story that keeps you glued to the screen!Screen writers James Vanderbilt (Zodiac, The Losers), Alvin Sargent (Ordinary People, Spider-Man 2 &3) and Steve Kloves (All the Harry Potter films) did the most important thing any screenplay should do - they kept the characters at the forefront and the action/special effects are the trimmings. The performances stand out so very much that the fact I saw it in IMAX and 3D only added to the entire experience. Although just as good in the 2-D screen in this case the 3-D was used sparingly and in very effective places.The story stays true to the original comic and keeps the fans in check - this modern take on the this Spider-Man is inventive, filled with technology but again, character driven first and foremost. Also of note is the style and colors of the costume for Spidey done brilliantly by Kym Barrett (The Matrix, Speed Racer). It works on many levels and makes Garfields' performance that much more believable. Also, the costumes for Spidey were actually constructed by the creative geniuses of Cirque Du Soleil.Another thing that I noticed and thoroughly enjoyed was the score by James Horner (Star Trek II:TWOK & III:TSFS, Titanic) - the super-hero theme is back - and it's not in your face, but you knew the web slinger was at his best with the subtle but spot-on `hero theme' he had.The movie is suspenseful, has `high' action, incredible effects and stunts - flawless CGI effects and was a crowd pleaser all the way around.

1417927,A1R17YELPTSM5T,B004LWZWFQ,MacJunegrand,"[0, 0]","Ugh, this is such a hard movie to review.While I was watching this on a theater, I was loving it.  I was cheering and laughing, I was excited and inmersed.  But, after I left the theater, I felt empty.  I felt as if the movie didn't make an impact on me.  I didn't think it was a bad film, it just wasn't a memorable one.I really liked Raimi's films, even the third one (which I feel is unjustly treated), and, for better or worse, those movies were memorable.  There are scenes in them I always keep on my mind, and on my heart.  Sure, they were purposely cheesy, sometimes unnervingly, but they were lovable and entertaining and they felt true to the characters.  I was mad at them ending for a reboot made for the wrong reasons, but after a while I kept an open mind and accepted it.Now, let's talk about this film.  The actors are, for the most part, well chosen.  The obvious issue comes from Garfield.  He's a great actor, yes, but in some scenes you can really tell he's three decades old, which sort of kills the mood.  Emma Stone is as good and adorable as always as Gwen.  Martin Sheen plays the perfect uncle Ben.  He doesn't say ""With great power comes great responsibility"", but then again, neither did he in the original comic.  Rhys Ifans makes an OK Dr. Connors, but the script has problems he can't solve.  Sally Fields is wasted as Aunt May, she's almost an afterthought, since you barely see her.  Denis Leary as Captain Stacy is one of the highlights, as he has good character motives and he's quite the badass.The costume designs are hit and miss.  I'm not a fan of Spidey's costume for the same reason I wasn't a fan of the costume in Raimi's films: it's too pretty.  It's supposed to be handmade by a teenager, it shouldn't look that great.  But I suppose that's a matter of personal preference.  I'm not a fan of the silver lines either.  Alex Ross makes a fantastic rendition of the homemade costume in Marvels, and it makes Spidey look more heroic.  Anyway, The Lizard... well, that's a problem.  I understand the choice of not giving him a muzzle, as it goes well with his first appereance in the comics, but the eyes... they're too human.  I understand what they were going for, but there's no reason to humanize a monster that regularly turns back into a human.  That being said, the skin and its wrinkles are wonderfully designed.The special effects are great.  They're quite better than in the original trilogy, and while you can easily tell the Lizard is CGI, most of the time the CGI Spidey is unnoticeable from the real one, and the same goes for CGI objects.  I didn't care for the 3D in theaters and I didn't purchase the 3D Blu Ray, so I don't know how it looks on the disc, but I don't think it will look any better.  Not that I think it would improve the movie at all.The script is the real foe here.  The movie is too obvious, as if the writers thought the audience would be too stupid.  There's also the token guy who tries too hard to be hated by the audience, the lack of a good introduction for Spidey, the characters being too dumb to realize the obvious truth about the others, the lack of responsibility from Spidey's part (even though that's supposed to be his main theme), the fact that they take absolutely no advantage of the mechanical web-shooters (seriously, infinite webbing), the fact that Dr. Connors' family is nowhere to be seen (despite that being a very important part of his character) and he behaves too much like the Green Goblin, and all that about ""The untold story"" remaining untold throughout the entire film.  And then there's the scene with the cranes...  That is wrong for so many reasons.That being said, this movie does handle a couple of things better.  The character of Flash Thompson is very well handled and actually matures.  The relationship between Peter and Gwen is great.  Spidey actually jokes this time.  Weirdly enough, though, the opinions of Gwen and George Stacy about Spidey are inverted from the ones in the comics.  That's not a complaint, it's just... weird.  And this is probably the best Stan Lee cameo to date.Why the 4 stars review?  As I said before, I don't think it's a bad film.  It's entertaining and engaging, it just won't leave a mark on you.About the Blu Ray:  The quality is fantastic, both in video and audio.  I haven't seen all the extras yet, but the ones I've watched are quite interesting.  There are a bunch of conceptual art and models for Spider-Man and The Lizard.  Some deleted scenes, including one in which post-injection Dr. Connors talks to his son Billy (why was this deleted?) and some details about how some scenes were filmed, which will surprise you when they show you how some things you believed to be real were actually CGI.As an aside, this movie comes with a spanish (latin american) dub audio track, despite the fact that the Amazon page doesn't mention it.",4,The Unasuming Spider-Man?,1354060800,"11 28, 2012",2012,4889,"['Ugh', 'such', 'hard', 'movie', 'review.While', 'was', 'watching', 'theater', 'was', 'loving', 'was', 'cheering',

1417929,AIY4H4KWR2KWZ,B004LWZWFQ,MadMacs,"[8, 15]","What kind of mentality hires a guy with exactly one major film under his belt, a quiet study-your-belly-button arthouse flick no less, to deliver on such a large action stage? I'm truly stunned. And despite what the numbers say, it's just as important to look at the breakdown. BoxOfficeMojo has this reboot a big time winner, but look carefully. Out of the $743M total receipts on a reported budget of $230M, not including a massive advertising campaign, check out how much came from domestic sales. Pretty much dead even with the budget. Very, very telling.Not particularly surprised, but very disappointed this new creative team intentionally injecting vampire angst into this story. Done while simultaneously fumbling and sacrificing the action aspect. Why?Add to that let down: Twenty-eight year old Andrew Garfield's surprisingly unsympathetic characterization in a role that was perfectly crafted to appeal to the youth market. Seriously, what bullied kid didn't want to have super powers at least once as an outcast teenager? But this guy, wow, very nearly drained the fun out the character. Bordering very close to callow goth territory sans the white face paint and mascara.And were there three subplots because there were three writers - each having to have their say? Collaborative efforts without a stern arbiter usually ends poorly. This being a prime example. An inconsistent script filled with unfinished threads and underhanded fiscal motivations:Examples:- Unfinished. What happened to Peter's fervent desire to find the man with the tattoo? Guess Gwen sorta swept the young man off his feet. Really? He's that shallow that Uncle Ben becomes nothing more than a trivial side-story? The bitter memory of self-indulgence that made Peter such a great hero - to never again let his personal b.s. overcome his greater responsibility - is completely obliterated in this version of Spidey. Pathetic.And in comparison, how utterly bizarre was it that Peter was more emotionally devastated at the loss of his girlfriend's father - a man he barely knew? Truly unbelievable. &lt;shaking head in dismay>- Underhanded. The moment Peter celebrates the full extent of his powers is via skateboard. Good gravy. What marketing bleep-hole forced that onto the movie? Why not showcase all the X-Games skills with bottles of Mountain Dew strewn about and be done with it? Shoot, why not just skip all the pretense and have Peter winning the X-Games and save us all the trouble?There were a few moments, lost in amongst the uneven editing, where there were glimpses of something wonderful and grand; where the actors touched us, the audience, and delivered something beyond the script. But those scenes were too little to save this production from mediocrity.This production is much less a reboot and more a twisted hybrid of commercial desires leeching off a dependable workhorse like a parasitic remora. Having paid my fee - I slogged through to the routine violin-synched melodramatic finish.Sony is doing something I never conceived: Killing the Golden Goose in order to eat goose.It doesn't make for good movies, but it makes interesting spectacle. Viewing shortsighted greed overwhelm better, smarter products. Sort of the gastronomic equivalent of watching McDonald's make their hamburgers without hamburger meat while telling everyone how great their new burgers will be. How long before people catch on? Is there a chance to save the franchise? This new business model interests me and, sadly, was the biggest attraction in screening the flick.Movie Notes:- I was going to say I felt sorry for Denis Leary but realized - bleep it - he got paid. The man's laughing cause it's not his movie.- Liked the C. Thomas Howell cameo. Man keeps chugging along. Proof that character actors can make a decent living in the industry.- Interestingly, and without intent, I screened a pair ofRhys Ifans films less than a week apart. Talk about a diametric contrast.

1417938,A139ZF7CJVVTJU,B004LWZWFQ,"Mark Eremite ""This Is A Display Model Only""","[28, 46]","I teach 8th graders in South Korea. During an end-of-term party, we watchedRushmore. Many of the kids liked the film, but a lot of them complained about it. ""What didn't you like about it?"" I asked them. ""It's old,"" they responded. ""Old? How do you know how old it is?"" I asked. They replied, ""None of the kids have cell phones"" or, my favorite, ""It just FEELS old."" ""Trust me,"" I told them. ""If you still feel this way about old things in ten to twenty years, you're going to end up just like Herman Blume from the movie: hating yourself.""I only relate this story because it seems like that attitude -- if something is from ten to fifteen years old then it is automatically worthless -- was what prompted this absolutely unnecessary and inferior reboot of the Spiderman franchise.It is nearly impossible to review this film without also referring toRaimi's trilogyof 9-4 years ago. I'm not here to say Raimi's films were flawless, but in spite of their various problems, they were certainly iconic for awhile, and the second film arguably set the benchmark for superhero movies at the time. Even if you hated all three of them, it would be very hard to argue for the existence of this film, since it adds very little (if anything at all) to the Spiderman story or its telling. Actually, if you hated Raimi's films, you are very much not likely to enjoy this film, since it glistens and zips around with a lot of the same high-sheen verve that you could find in Raimi's films.But let's not compare, as tantalizing an option as that is. As is, does this film hold up?Not really. First of all, the movie tinkers with Spiderman's origins. I'm not some kind of purist who cares all that much about staying true to the source material, but the original story did have a readily identifiable moral structure and some pretty solid symbolic aspects that propelled the rest of Peter Parker's tale. In this case, Uncle Ben, rather than a mostly benign voice of reason and responsibility, is a thick-headed and annoying do-gooder. Originally, it is Parker's selfish carelessness that puts Uncle Ben in harms way. This time, Uncle Ben voluntarily puts himself in harms way in an act of do-goodery that is absolutely senseless and bound to fail. The film mutates its moral center from ""with great power comes great responsibility"" to ""crazy old men shouldn't wander around the streets picking fights with armed thugs.""Let's ignore that, though. It's only about ten minutes of the film. The rest of the flick follows Parker as he stumbles ludicrously into his powers. The chain of events that lead to this scene stretch credulity, since they seem to exist in a world where common sense is no longer common. Just as one example: Parker illegally gains access to a massive, top secret, and highly dangerous scientific facility by pretending to be an intern. When the real intern shows up, he is dragged kicking and screaming out of the door in a scene that hopes it is so funny that audiences will not wonder why no one in this highly classified building ever asks for I.D.There is so much more. Parker's classmate, Gwen, is played by the 23 year-old Emma Stone, who is a young cutie but nowhere near convincing as a high schooler, especially when she is leading tours in the aforementioned high-tech lab. Andrew Garfield is far more believable as our titular character, and although he's a lot nicer to look at and more fun to watch than Tobey Maguire ever was, his character is so inconsistent that it gets jarring. By the time he started ordering and making his very own wrist-strapped-web-slingers (this new Spiderman can't make his own webs), I wondered why he ever stayed in school with his amazing ability to craft unheard of machinery using unheard of chemicals. And how did he even get access to this stuff? Oh, wait. I forgot. This world never asks for I.D.It's silly. It's pointless. It's even kind of demeaning (more than once, the movie uses news report voice overs to remind the audience of what happened in the scene that they JUST watched). There are some fun moments when Spiderman is whipping around the city, and Parker gets a few amusing quips in here and there, but the whole thing is so schlocky and rote that it feels like the over-eager, under-talented younger brother of the first Raimi film. Perhaps if they'd decided to completely revamp the whole thing from top to bottom, including the origins, the setting, and the characters, there would be something here to talk about.

1417941,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B004LWZWFQ,Mark Turner,"[2, 3]","It may seem longer but it's only been 10 years since Spider-man first swung his way across the silver screen increasing the public interest in seeing major films spun from comic book titles. And yet Sony has decided that it needed something fresh, it needed a reboot to the series. This could be because the stars would now be seeking bigger bucks when it came to contract time. Or it could be that the success of the third film in that series didn't live up to their expectations. In any event, a reboot was released and now makes its way to DVD. Was it worth it?THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN ups the ante by not just picking up where the other films left off but starting from scratch. Instead of Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) automatically living with his Aunt May (Sally Field) and Uncle Ben (Martin Sheen), we get to see a glimpse of his parents, secretive scientists who whisk him away to the aunt and uncle when their home is broken into leaving behind only Peter and a briefcase that comes into play later on.Peter in this version isn't the stereotypical science nerd as depicted in the first film or in the comics. He comes off more as a brooding teen who still get picked on and who has yet decided to be a professional photographer. He has issues with his adoptive parents like any teen and seeking answers comes across the aforementioned briefcase with a hidden compartment containing a formula and a picture of his father alongside another scientist, Dr. Curt Conners (Rhys Ifans).Sneaking in with a group in intern wannabes Peter discovers Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone), the girl he worships from afar, works for him as Oscorp. During the tour he catches the attention of Connors and eventually reveals that he is the son of his old friend. It is also during this visit that Peter is bitten by a DNA enhances spider that provides him with the ever popular hero's super powers, those of a spider. He explores just what these will do and keeps his findings to himself.Connors and Peter begin working together on the formula that Peter found and apply it to a project Connors has been working on, combining interspecies DNA in the hopes of finding cures such as a reptiles ability to re-grow body parts. Connors has a personal interest in this as he lost an arm years ago.After forgetting to pick up his aunt one night, Peter and his uncle get into a fight with Peter running off as a result. When Ben goes to search for Peter, he is gunned down by a many Peter could have stopped who robbed a grocery store. Now the character turns dark and seeks vengeance on the man who killed his uncle, tracking down every punk criminal in a dark alley and getting the police involved in searching for a masked vigilante in the process.But here's the only problem I had with this movie. Connors won't rush the test results of his project through to satisfy Oscorp so they plan on canceling the project. That night he injects himself and not only does his arm grow back, he changes into a giant lizard as well. When he wreaks havoc on the city, Peter changes his plans and all thoughts about his uncle's killer disappear and combating the Lizard takes center stage. There isn't a smooth enough transition here and it makes the movie feel like two movies in one, neither of which is complete.Along the way to the inevitable final confrontation between good guy and bad, Peter continues to fall in love with Gwen and find that love returned, meets her father the police chief (Dennis Leary) who he argues with over the objectives of Spider-man and continues to have problems at home and school.One thing those at Marvel have almost always done right is hiring the perfect people to cast as their characters. There isn't a single actor here who doesn't get the part and perform it well. None of them take the performances of the previous actors and apply them here, instead making these characters their own. Garfield in particular doesn't give off the total nerd vibe that Tobey McGuire did so well, instead playing Peter as a teen filled with the usual angst and rebellious nature that he must learn to control as much as his powers.As should be expected the effects are amazing, pun intended, and the visual feel of the film goes the opposite of the original films. Everything here seems dark, from the colors used for Spider-man's costume to the settings. Most of the action takes place at night making the film at times seem more along the lines of the Batman films than Spider-man which was always a bright colored adventure in the comics.All that aside, I actually found that I liked this film. Perhaps not the first time I watched it, but on DVD certain things made more sense to me. The skateboarding that Peter does connected with the poses used by Spider-man as he leaps from building to building, web to web. As I said, with the exception of the seemingly split storyline, the film is really quite entertaining. Not only is this one a movie worth watching, its one worth adding to your collection as well.",4,QUICK REVAMP,1352764800,"11 13, 2012",2012,5000,"['may', 'seem', 'longer', 'only', 'been', '10',

In high school he is bullied while none of the onlookers offers help even after he helped someone weaker than him.  Fortunately he gets in touch with his instincts as symbolized by the spider bite and discovers his power/vitality.  He is now faced with the challenge of how to apply it.  He considers using it for revenge and is encouraged to do so by the bully.  He considers being indifferent to others but it costs him his uncle.  He recalls the words of his father and uncle, that the responsibility of power is to be used in an adult-like way, and with this saves the city and wins the girl.The Conners character also experienced a lot of loss.  The pain is so great that the ""lizard"" side of him co-opts his higher brain functions and is unable to see that his desire for ""a world without weakness"" comes from the harm he experienced.  He hasn't yet considered that he may be emotionally frozen in time, in a world, his childhood world, where he is, as all children are in the face of their parents, vulnerable and weak.  What he doesn't realize yet, is that in the present, a man with his weakness is his connection to himself.  His slogan could be also be code for ""I feel pain and I want it to go away because long ago I was vulnerable and I wish I hadn't been.  I was overwhelmed.  I need strength to deal with this.  My parents expected the world of me and I don't want to disappoint them.  I love them and I don't want to lose them.""  Peter offers to ""talk it out"" with him but since he is experiencing such high levels of cortisol and adrenaline in his system, isn't able to see the point.  He has also forgotten that he is more than his brain.  In the end, in the nick of time, an antidote was found and he reclaimed his humanity.For its entertainment value, I also think this is the best Spiderman movie made to date.  The Peter character was very humourous and his relationship with Gwen made for a very nice partnership/romance.  Since we are ""wired for story,"" I found this line from the movie fitting, ""I had a professor once who liked to tell his students that there are only ten different plots in all of fiction.  Well, I'm here to tell you that he was wrong.  There's only one.""  The answer offered is a classic paradox, something seemingly very simple yet very difficult at the same time.

I watched the Blu Ray and was pleasantly surprised at the picture quality and the movie itself. It does have a certain Twilight-esque feeling at times, but nowhere near as cheesy. I find this movie comparable to Batman Begins where we learn the character's emotional motivation. I don't want to spoil anything, but you can definitely tell from a few new changes from the previous Spiderman that this movie's core rationale was Nolan's Batman Trilogy. The Spiderman in this film seems to be more like the comics in that Spiderman is a bit more playful even if this film did stray in other areas. The villain really isn't that terrifying, but the villain is only one of the many obstacles Peter Parker has to face.

1417954,A1CDNTB7377YH2,B004LWZWFQ,Michael A. Newman,"[2, 3]","When I first knew that this franchise was being rebooted, I asked myself why? Then knowing that The Lizard would be the villian, I thought that this movie would be worse than the last mishmash that was Spiderman 3. The why was quickly answered from the first scene. We see a young Peter Parker with his parents, first playing hide and seek with his Dad, then later being brought to live with his Aunt and Uncle when something seems to have gone wrong with his father.Peter never sees his parents again, and Aunt May and Uncle Ben become his parents. He goes to high school and is set upon by the school bully, Flash Thompson. He has a crush on a girl from his class, Gwen Stacey who really doesn't notice him. He is only known for his photography skills.Later he finds a photo of his father with another man. He goes to his Uncle to ask who is the other man. His Uncle looks uncomfortable but says he doesn't know him. Later, his Uncle relents and lets Peter know that the man in the picture is Curt Connors and he was his father's partner. Peter learns that Connors works on Genetic Engineering for Oscorp and goes there to see what he may know about his father.While there, Peter wanders into a room where generic engineering is happening on spiders. Of course, one of them gets in his clothing and will later bite him beginning the legend. As Peter realizes his powers he still doesn't know what to do with himself. That all changes when he goes to a convenience store to buy milk but doesn't have enough money to pay for it. The clerk refuses to let him go and when a suspicious looking character comes in to rob the place, Peter gets even with the clerk by not stopping the thief. Unfortunately, this thief will then kill his Uncle Ben.Peter, learns from the police that his Uncle's murderer is the same thief he failed to stop. This sets him looking for bad guys to see if he can find his Uncle's murderer. To tell the rest would give spoilers but Gwen Stacey will later become his girlfriend and her father is the police chief who starts going after Spiderman for being a vigilante.Now the answer to my second point, this movie is a lot better than Spiderman 3. It may even be better than the first Spiderman film but not nearly as good as the Doc Ock film. The filmakers have changed a lot things from the original story. The actor that plays Peter is more of an outcast than the nerd that Peter was supposed to be. There is no real reason why one would believe that all of a sudden Gwen would start liking him. Sally Field, though well into her 60's looks a heck of a lot younger than the comic book Aunt May. Peter comes home all hours of the night, obviously having been in fights and she never questions him about what he was doing.Captain Stacey is a more believable Spiderman PR adversary than the comical J. Johnah Jameson portrayed in the earlier films. Overall this is a much better made film than the originals but there were several parts that tended to drag. It did have its one Stan Lee comic relief moment and Curt Connors makes a good villian. Don't miss the brief scene a little bit into the credits because it provides the setup for the next film.Overall, It was a good film and I do look forward to the next installment.

It was very good job and I don't understand the one star reviews for a A list movie of this caliber. My only complaints are the fact that the film should have been shot in 3d and not redone in 3d in post production.  It's a dark movie picture wise and the 3d version is even darker than the 2d version! ,and native 3d will always look far batter than movies shot in 2d and processed in 3d. It looks similar to ""John Carter'  in way the 3d looks. which is good but not the same as a native 3d film looks. That's a small gripe considering they did a fine job on this film in everything else. There's a lot of criticism about the way the lizard looks. He looks better in the comic books. Sure, but he looks good in this film too.  And did we need it to be rebooted? , probably not this early but it still worked for me. And it's a big budget film that makes it points well.  It was good to see spiderman back in high school and having to deal with flash tompson. IN the comics Flash becomes 'man wolf' and spiderman must battle him.  But that's another story.  The film hopefully will have a sequel someday and let's hope they shoot it in 3d! It makes a huge difference on how well the 3d film will look.  The blu ray comes with a whole disc of extras. And for those with 2d TV's the film looks just about the same , but with less depth. I would say"" if you love superhero films then this one is a very good one.  Few fans hated this as compared to 'the green hornet' , or 'green lantern' , both of which were decent but not great. With 'green hornet' being a part comedy at that.

1417961,A3PPXVR5J6U2JD,B004LWZWFQ,"Michael J. Tresca ""Talien""","[10, 25]","Was another Spider-Man film really necessary? ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" had to distinguish itself from the three Spider-Man films that went before, still in recent memory. The answer of course is to simply reboot the franchise, just as Christopher Nolan's Batman was a reboot of Tim Burton's whimsical take on the iconic character.Let's get a few things straight: Andrew Garfield makes for an excellent Peter Parker. He's moody, sarcastic, and acrobatic in a way that's believable - more skater punk than class nerd, but smart enough to make us believe he could create his own wristwatch web slingers. Martin Sheen is excellent as his crotchety but wise Uncle Ben. But Emma Stone's husky-voiced presence makes Gwen Stacey more sexy high school teacher than high school crush; Dennis Leary still echoes his role as a firefighter from Rescue Me; and Rhys Ifans blathers on unconvincingly as Dr. Curt Connors about trans-species DNA.And that's part of the problem. ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" wants the audience to take this incarnation more seriously as a grim version of the iconic hero, but regularly throws comic book logic at us and expects us to swallow it. The script goes to great lengths to justify Parker's access to his web slingers, going so far as inserting a flickering red special effect to remind us that its technology firing the sticky strands...until the artists forget to include it in every other scene. THE AMAZING SPOILER MAN: When a terrorist threatens to detonate a dirty bomb over the city, we're expected to believe that only the police and a few crane operators will step up to handle the crisis.The other problem is that the film lacks a sense of place. Those of us born in New York City know that much of this movie wasn't filmed there (it was mostly filmed in Los Angeles). Arch-henchman Dr. Rajit Ratha (Irrfan Khan) who drives Connors over the edge literally disappears with his own version of the mystery serum in his clutches, never to be mentioned again - not even after the credits. But perhaps the least forgivable is that Parker can swing from a dunk in sewage straight to his girlfriend's bedroom with nary a mention that he stinks.Even Uncle Ben's speech has been muddled and filtered so that he never issues his ""with great power comes great responsibility"" phrase. Instead Parker gets chastised about breaking a basketball backboard (""Feels good, doesn't it?"") and a lecture about apologizing to Aunt May.Spider-Man himself is perfectly executed onscreen -- never once is there a moment where he seems like a CGI-effect, a rare feat. But Spider Man's wisecracks are more sarcastic teenager snarks and this more realistic version is much less acrobatic. ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" goes to great lengths to demonstrate how powerful Spidey's hands can stick to an object, but then never explains if the power extends to his feet or how he can climb walls through clothing.Although it may be unfair, the best comparison for a reboot of this magnitude is ""Batman Begins."" ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" never quite achieves that level of greatness.

The third film had a lot to live up to with great hype, but while it made the money it failed to please a lot of fans (myself included). The way that movie ended it would seem hard to continue an entertaining enough story, and I doubt many would care to see where it. So, probably to hold onto the rights of this money making franchise, Sony Pictures decided to reboot Spider-Man and try again. Not a bad thing in my book.In a nutshell I liked this new movie more than the last, but I'm unsure if it was better than the original trilogies first two films. I feel there's a lot I liked and equally some things not so much.Peter Parker seems more like an actual ""today's nerd"" high school student genius (making webshooters) rather than a thirty-something year old pretending to be young (sorry Toby you'd be more the later years Spidey). I really liked that we get Gwen Stacy (played by the lovely Emma Stone) before MJ in Peters life. I also found using his parents an interesting sub-plot, and something worth exploring. Finally we get to see Doc Connors turn into The Lizard, and maybe that's worth the reboot right there.Whats not so hot is there's time I felt the story seemed rush or missing scenes--something, I don't know what! The musical score, I did not enjoy like how I do in other superhero films. In fact the score during the fight scene with The Lizard in the high school felt out of place, as if the music was meant for another scene. It took me out of the scene, a theatrical ""no no."" The Lizard looked more like Killer Croc from Batman than from Spider-Man. Not entirely a bad design, but too human perhaps in the face. Spidey, hang up that cell phone and leave your mask on! Studio's need to get a grip with superheroes and masks already. I actually think its the biggest downer of this film. Leave. Your. Mask. On!!! The CG that Sony studios use is kind of cartoon-ish compared to other films which use heavy CG in my book.I could probably go on with likes and dislikes, but its important to remember that overall I enjoyed it enough to buy the BD and curious what lies ahead in the sequels.Visually the blu-ray looks pretty stunning. I can't comment on the 3D quality since I missed out on the last sale of the combo that included it, and I guess that's fine by me. Surround sound is equally pleasing.

1417972,A1AFXJ8U72MD6L,B004LWZWFQ,"MISTER SJEM ""sonofhotpie""","[3, 5]","This reboot of Spidey came about when Raimi's directing of a potential SPIDERMAN 4 fell apart for various reasons. In this reboot Andrew Garfield plays a skinny Peter Parker which fits the recent comics artwork more so than Tobey's time in the trilogy (though I felt Tobey's Spidey tales was better until SPIDERMAN 3 and then it got somewhat stupid). His love interest is not Mary Jane but an actual character from Marvel Comics called Gwen Stacy (who was supposed to have been the first love of Peter Parker) who is played by Emma Stone (most people know her from GLEE).There is a great deal more teenage angst in this picture and while Tobey Maguire brought a steady coolness to his role Andrew Garfield tends to bring a frenetic energy to the role that made him feel more like an American teenager. Speaking of which there's a more impressive cast in this reboot which includes: Dennis Leary, Martin Sheen, Sally Field, Campbell Scott, Rhys Ifans and C. Thomas Howell.Peter Park is more of a science whiz kid in this picture and has a connection with Oscorps. There's also an actual scientific illustration of how Parker gains his powers in this film unlike the usual freak accident coming about. The Lizard opponent is big and tough but I felt they didn't milk the potential emotional tension. Woops.So how does it compare to the Tobey Maguire trilogy? I think the story was good but not as good as the previous trilogy. This current trilogy obviously has better special effects. Dawwwwwwhhhh. This trilogy has a more accurate take on a teenage superhero and I like that they're playing around with Gwen Stacy.Look for the usual Stan Lee cameo appearance. Themes of everybody missing something in their life is rampant.The budget for this film was a whopping $230M but it made over $752M at the Box Office. This film premiered in Tokyo, Japan.

1417973,AKJ9MEE93DG5O,B004LWZWFQ,mitchell5954,"[4, 8]","Amazing Spiderman is the unneeded reboot of the Spiderman movie franchise.  The very fact that this movie was even made annoys me.  Firstly, I think it was way too soon to reboot the franchise.  Amazing Spiderman came out in 2012, which is only five years after Spiderman 3 came out.  Originally Sam Raimi was working on Spiderman 4, but due to the bad reception of Spiderman 3 Sony decided to abandon that project in favor of this movie.  Honestly, I would rather have gotten Spiderman 4 than a reboot.  The fact that Sony decided to reboot everything because of one misstep annoys me.  The X-Men franchise has had multiple stinkers but they have yet to reboot everything.  The majority of the Transformers films are bad but they still continue to be made.  Despite the negative reception Spiderman 3 had the highest gross of all three Raimi movies.  As you can guess I did not like this film at all.  I just felt it was a very boring retread that was done better the first time with the Raimi films.  Say what you want about the other Spiderman films but I will take them any day (including Spiderman 3) over this film.There are a couple things I like about the film that they improved on from the original films.  Andrew Garfield, in my opinion, does a better job as Peter Parker, performance wise, than Tobey McGuire.  I like Tobey as Peter Parker/Spiderman.  I blame the writing for most of the issues I have with him.  However, there are times when his delivery felt very forced and/or corny.  Andrew Garfield has few of those moments, except one scene which felt very forced.  Plus he looks much more like Peter in the comics nowadays as opposed to Tobey McGuire who, like the Raimi films in general, is trying to capture the old school Spiderman from when he was first released in the 1960s.  Also, Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy does a great job and plays a much better main female character than Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane.  Kirsten is a fine actress but she did not capture the essence of the Mary Jane from the comics at all.  Not-to-mention she was just a token love interest/damsel in distress in all three Raimi films.  At least Gwen Stacy was able to defend herself and was not the damsel in distress here.  Plus Emma Stone does a better acting job.  Some of the action scenes are also fun to watch, but they are few and far between.  The action in the original movies is miles better.The biggest problem is the story.  This movie is basically a retread of the original from the origin to even the villain.  There are some changes but they are not even noteworthy.  First of all, why did you have to retell Spiderman&#8217;s origin?  Spiderman&#8217;s origin has already been done before (and done better I might add) in the very first film as well as various animated series that have come out over the years.  The majority of people, whether it&#8217;d be comic book fans or the general public, already know the origin.  There was no reason to go over it again, and there was definitely no reason for it to take up about half of the film.  The origin in Raimi&#8217;s film only took a half hour or a bit more while this took over fifty minutes.  There some alterations but they are pointless and, in my opinion, lame.  When I watched this film I was bored out of my mind in the first half.Unfortunately the second half did not do much for me either.  The villain is lame and boring.  He is basically a poor retread of Green Goblin (Norman Osborn) from the first film.  The Lizard (Dr. Connors) is basically Green Goblin but without the energy is his performance.  They were both scientists experimenting with unstable concoction that ends up giving them enhanced abilities and they end up becoming super villains.  They are also both green (though The Lizard is a mutation while Norman just wore a suit).  This film even ripped off the split personality thing that Norman had and had Connors exhibit it as well.  Can you not come up with anything new?  Unlike Green Goblin, the Lizard is just a bore.  Green Goblin at least had energy and you loved to hate him.  The only thing the Lizard had over Green Goblin is that his motivations are clearer.  Ultimately, his main goal is just a stereotypical comic book villain plot and nothing more, which would not be so bad if the villain was more interesting and more fun.  I have problems with the Green Goblin in the first film but he is a much more entertaining film and Willem Dafoe brings his A-game unlike the guy who plays the Lizard who was sleepwalking through his role.This film is also guilty of false advertising.  The trailers advertised that Peter&#8217;s parents would be in the movie and would play a big part in Spiderman&#8217;s origin.  This actually got me excited when I heard about it.  Peter&#8217;s parents had never been explore or even mentioned on screen before.  Even in the comics they are rarely touched upon.  I thought that this would be a great addition to Spiderman&#8217;s mythos and would help this film stand out from the others.  Instead this plot point was only teased to us in multiple parts of the film (mainly the beginning) and is left to be explained in the sequel.  No! That&#8217;s unacceptable.  You cannot advertise such a large plot element in the trailers but do nothing with it.  That&#8217;s called false advertising.Even though I like Andrew Garfield as Peter I do not like this Peter Parker.  People complain about Peter in the Raimi films being too whiny but this Peter is just as whiny.  He also comes off as a jerk to everyone a number of times throughout this movie especially to Aunt May and Gwen.  He is too downbeat is the problem.  Tobey McGuire was more upbeat than him.  Peter Parker/Spiderman is supposed to be a more upbeat character that uses his wit with villains to cope with his situation, which he barely does here.  All of the advertising that was released was promoting a wittier Spiderman and everyone constantly raves about how Spiderman is actually witty in this, but he&#8217;s not.  He tells like four jokes in the entire film.  Tobey McGuire used his wit just as much in the first film.  Tobey&#8217;s Spiderman did not use his wit nearly as much as he should have but it is not like he never used it.  I can think of three or four times in each of the three movies where he tries to be witty and funny, which is about as many times as Andrew Garfield did.  This is another case of false advertising.  Also, I do not like the new costume Spiderman has.  If there was one thing that the Raimi films got right 100% it was the costume.  The new costume does not look as cool and it is too dark, much like the film itself.I have the same problem with Peter as I do with the movie in general in that he is too dark.  Another major issue with the film is that it is too dark.  Amazing Spiderman feels very much like Batman Begins from the majority of the film focusing on origin to the overall look of the film to the very tone of the film which is too dark.  The film might as well be called Spiderman Begins rather than Amazing Spiderman.  Spiderman is not Batman.  They are two completely different characters.  Just because The Dark Knight Trilogy is popular does not mean you can use the same tone for every superhero.  Marvel Studios understands this so why can&#8217;t other studios understand it.  You can say that the other film (especially the first one) is too campy but they felt much more like Spiderman than this movie did.Peter, in this film, is not only too dark but he is also a moron.  He is supposed to be a genius but he does not come off as smart at all in this.  After he discovers his abilities there are several scenes where he shows he has powers in public places whether it&#8217;d be in a subway or his school.  There are also a couple scenes where he is web-slinging in the middle of the city without his costume where everyone can clearly see him.  Really Peter!?  How it that none of these people put it together that he is Spiderman?  There are scenes like that in the original film but they are done subtler than it is here.  He also puts his name on some of his personal belongings which is how The Lizard figures out he is Spiderman.  Both Gwen and her father bother find out his secret too.  He cannot keep his identity a secret to save his life.  I know he is supposedly a teenager but he is a complete idiot in this film.Some of the casting does not work for me either.  I like Martin Sheen as an actor his take on Uncle Ben did nothing for me and I did not care for Sally Field as Aunt may at all.  To me, Cliff Robertson and Rosemary Harris are the definitive Uncle Ben and Aunt May.On another note, the effects are subpar.  I cannot believe that this film cost more than the Avengers.  Some of the effects look pretty good but most of them are on par with the first film which came out a decade prior to this.  The effects of Spiderman 2 & 3 beat the crap out of the effects in this movie.  For example, the CGI for the Lizard himself is god-awful.  He looks almost as silly as the Green Goblin&#8217;s costume in the first movie.  The score is completely forgettable.  Say what you want about the score for the other three movies, but at least it is memorable.  I do not remember the music for Amazing Spiderman at all.Overall, I did not like this movie at all.  I know I am in the minority but I do not care.  Hopefully Amazing Spiderman 2 is actually good.  Say what you want about the original film, but that film is timeless, it has heart, and it is, above all, fun.  I like all of the Sam Raimi films better than this film.  Yes, I even prefer Spiderman 3 over this.  That film was, at least, entertaining.  This movie is boring, a retread of the first film, too dark, and is not that fun at all, in my opinion.",1,A Boring Retread,1399075200,"05 3, 2014",2014,9786,"['Amazing', 'Spiderman', 'unneeded',

1417974,A1845IJB63D5H7,B004LWZWFQ,"Mohamed F. El-Hewie ""Mohamed F. El-Hewie""","[14, 44]","The story of the movie appears to have been improvised on the go or after the shooting started. There is no coherent theme or clearly defined character that could inspire the actors to believe in their roles in the movie.Apparently, the moviemaker opted on the catchy title of Spiderman in order to drag kids into the movie theaters. The slow flow of narration and the confusion of the actors on what to do or show was further aggravated by the lengthy and irrelevant acrobatic shots which were done in haste and with the slightest appreciation of the viewers' right to see reasonable flow of motions.At the onset, some secretive and serious scientist disappeared after leaving his son with his aunt. The departure of the father and his wife was cold, irrational, and inexplicable. The orphaned boy now grows up and retraces his Dad's scientific work which took him to a colleague of his father working on crossing species to produce powerful humans.With such lousy scientific proposal, the son got bitten by an experimental spider which lent him the advantages of the crossing of Homo sapiens with the Arachnida class. Because the story was carved recklessly, there was no logical explanation on how such lousy draped human spider produces strings or overcome gravity.The role played by the scientist amputee was also confusing. Early in the movie, the scientist works in a private laboratory. Later, he works in underground bizarre lab. After being converted into a lizard by virtue of a drug he manufactured, he seems to change his mind and returns as human, back and forth.The most annoying aspect of the movie was the slow flow of dialogues with irrational transitions to irrelevant scenes. in a high school science class, all actors appeared in their thirties, the main female girlfriend, who claimed to be 17 appeared in her late thirties.As the story turns cold and boring, the NY Police department shows up only with sirens and amateur fighting skills in dealing with fictionally threatening scenario.Even if one assumes that the movie was intended to keep kids occupied during the summer, most of the scenes in the movie are no match to most electronic animations available free on the Internet. Compared toKick-Ass, The Amazing Spider-Man merely squandered the talents of its actors by the sloppy writing of the story and the sleazy short cut in graphic animations.Mohamed F.

First off the 3D is great, the only problem is there is not that much of it. The scenes that take place indoors are really flat, and so are some of the outdoor scenes. The scenes where Spider-Man is swinging or shooting his webs are where the 3D is, especially the first person pov! Since this movie is over 2 hours long, those few scenes, even though they are great, just are not worth it.Now onto the 2D version! This is a awesome looking movie. I don't understand all the complaining about the cgi, I think it looks great, especially the Lizard, the detail to him was spectacular, and so is Spider-Mans suit.I enjoyed this Spider-Man more than the previous 3 movies, and I think others would to if they just stop comparing this to the other ones, and let it be its own movie. It had some comedy, some great action scenes, and the actors were great.  I think Andrew is a hell of alot better as Spider-Man than Tobey was. His range of emotions were great, and totally believable! Emma Stone was great as usual and did a terrific job of playing Gwen! Same with Rhus as Dr.Conner/The Lizard. I also enjoyed Martin Sheen as Uncle Ben was really cool, even though his screen time was very limited. Last but not least is Sally Field as Aunt May! Sally just comes off as genuine loving and caring Aunt May, and she does such a terrific job.So in conclusion, I just have to say that my family and I really enjoyed watching this movie, and surprisingly at the end of it none of us wanted it to end (not even my wife who hated the other Spider-Man movies), which was surprising since this movie runs over 2 hours. We are all looking forward to the next installment.

I have watched the Spiderman trilogy that came out in the 2000s and thought they were pretty well done, but for some reason I enjoyed this Spiderman more.  For example, I found the character of Spiderman rather annoying in the trilogy whereas I could relate to his character better in this one.  I also like how this version had more background to the story as it started off with Peter Parker as a child living with his parents and touches a little bit upon his dad and how he was a very secretive man.  I also found the relationship between Peter Parker and Mary Jane really annoying in the Trilogy but the relationship he had with Gwen Stacy was more realistic and not over dramatized.  The fighting scenes were typical superhero style of fast paced and lots of smashing with the hero seeming to be the weaker out of the two but that is what is expected from these movies.  Of course there were many similarities played out differently in this movie when compared to the first of the older Trilogy.  For example, the spider bite, the fate of the uncle, Peter letting a thieve go due to his irritation with the person being robbed, the split personality of the villain, and so on.  They were just played out quite differently.  Peter Parker in this movie was also much funnier I thought; especially when he is dealing with the car thieve.  I found it to be an overall enjoyable movie and just about anyone who likes action will like it and my 6-year-old son really enjoyed it so it is a good movie for the younger generation.",5,I think this was better than the first of the Trilogy,1356739200,"12 29, 2012",2012,1734,"[""'m"", 'not', 'comic', 'reader', 'have', 'never', 'read', 'ones', 'Spiderman', ""'m"", 'more', 'movie', 'fan', 'so', 'are', 'looking', 'review', 'movie', 'comics', 'review', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'helpful', 'have', 'watched', 'Spiderman', 'trilogy', 'came', 'out', '2000s', 'thought', 'were', 'pretty', 'well', 'done', 'reason', 'enjoyed', 'Spiderman', 'more', 'example', 'found', 'character', 'Spiderman', 'rather', 'annoying', 'trilogy', 'whereas', 'could', 'relate', 'character', 'better', 'one', 'also', 'how', 'version', 'had', 'more', 'background', 'story', 'started', 'off', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'child', 'living', 'parents', 'little', 'bit', 'dad', 'how', 'was', 'very', 'secretive', 'man', 'also', 'found', 'relationship', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'really', 'annoying', 'Trilogy', 'relationship', 'had', 'Gwen', 'Stacy', 'was', 'more', 'realistic', 'not', 'dramatized', 'fighting', 'scenes', 'were', 'typical', 'superhero', 'style', 'fast', 'paced', 'lots', 'smashing', 'hero', 'seeming', 'be', 'weaker', 'two', 'what', 'expected', 'movies', 'course', 'were', 'many', 'similarities', 'played', 'out', 'differently', 'movie', 'when', 'compared', 'first', 'older', 'Trilogy', 'example', 'spider', 'bite', 'fate', 'uncle', 'Peter', 'letting', 'thieve', 'go', 'due', 'irritation', 'person', 'being', 'robbed', 'split', 'personality', 'villain', 'so', 'were', 'just', 'played', 'out', 'quite', 'differently', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'movie', 'was', 'also', 'much', 'funnier', 'thought', 'especially', 'when', 'dealing', 'car', 'thieve', 'found', 'be', 'overall', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'just', 'anyone', 'who', 'action', 'will', 'like', '6-year-old', 'son', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'good', 'movie', 'younger', 'generation']",The Amazing Spider-Man

The dialogue was quite good for an action movie; especially that between Peter and Dr. Connors.

The rest of the audience also seemed to enjoy this as well.While I did enjoy the Tobey McGuire spiderman movies - I was never a big fan.  They were somewhat cheesy and sappy and not ones I'd want to watch multiple times. But we were in the mood for seeing a movie and since this just came out - this was mostly all that was playing today, so this is what we saw.It is basically the same core story -- (he is raised by Aunt May/Uncle Ben, he still gets bit by a ""special"" spider to become spider man, Uncle Ben still dies, Peter blames himself, etc.) --  HOWEVER it is all done in a MUCH more hip/fresh and enjoyable way.  We really liked this cast and the new twists to the story.The evil guy in this character is done very well - great costume/makeup. [Speaking of makeup, Sally Field fans should be warned, she looks horrible in this movie].This movie ends with the suggestion there will be another movie with this cast, which will let us in on what happened to Peter's parents.  I am looking forward to it!Check out the trailers for a good idea if you'll like it or not.BOTTOM LINE:This movie was WELL DONE overall and VERY ENJOYABLE.

Richko ""tarkin""","[1, 2]","was re - watching the amazing spider man last night, and it dawned on me..that i never reveiwed this one... so here i am with my 2 cents on it..like everybody, i was excited for spider-man 4 with maguire and company  back for another adventure ..but when the news was announced that they scrapped the film and then a few months later a ""reboot""  ""untold story"" or whatever you want to call it..was announced..it left a bad taste to lots of fans..myself included...it was and STILL is  way too early to reboot the films..the only reason was probably to get a film into production fast to retain the rights to the character..or it would revert back to marvel.  personally, i was hoping the rights would have reverted  back to marvel ..can you imagine a spider-man film actually done by marvel studios?  that would be TRULY EPIC !!  but, i digress..the amazing spider-man was released, i saw it..kept an open mind..and ill say it has it moments.. but to me it was MISSING something...it didnt have that ""marvel feeling""  the sam raimi spider-man films were something special..you could feel it.. sure, a lot of people panned those films too...you cant have everything. with a beloved character like spider-man, everybody has an opinion .i always summed it up like this..the sam raimi film trilogy  was for the classic, die hard fans..where the new spidey film (or films,  since the second one is in production ) is geared to the ""ultimate"" marvel universe line..thats the 21st century take on the characters  for those who dont know.sometimes, a reboot works...sometimes it dosent.  mostly for a reboot your pandering to a particular  group of viewers etc  such as teens, or the people that never read comics...i myself have been a die hard fan and im an  avid comic collector, so when i first saw this i was comparing it to  spider-man 1..and im sure many people were also.sure, both directors  took some creative liberties with the property as with all films based on this genre..  its to be expected  but for the amazing spider-man they went a bit extreme..such as ""reworking"" the death of uncle ben..sure, the essence was still there  but to me it didnt gel right.. uncle ben still gets shot and everything but it wasnt the same...now, take look at the sam raimi film..he did it right..  plus there wasnt the famous line that became peter's mantra ""with great power..comes great responsibility"" how you forget something that important??  instead, they cobbled up some lame dialogue..that never really worked . for the origin..you stick with what works.speaking of the origin..if you read the ultimate spidey books  you know what im talking about there..peter was bitten by an altered spider blah  blah..which turns out to have been part of some  ""secret"" project run by oscorp and peter's parents were involved with that project also (hence the untold story angle) ..yep, we will see Norman osborn again at some point in the series..and you all know his alter ego will probably be back also:)  personally , i liked willem dafoes's norman osborn...but chris cooper is a great choice for the next film...you have to have a great actor for the villin..or it does not work.we see peter..come to grips with his newfound powers...  hes still a nerd, but they made him emo..which for me it didnt work.. plus parker rides a skateboard?  give me a break.  but, i liked how they finally included  peter building real  web shooters this time around..i would have liked to have seen them in the raimi films though. like i said this one is a mixed bag..the costume in this film, is hit or miss...some people like it some dont..i wasnt big on the new suit ..but after seeing it in action in this film it works..it looks homemade..and it fits with what they were trying to do...where in the other film it was more of a big budget looking suit that came out of nowhere...still, i prefer the raimi style suit..and the upcoming new film's suit from pics ive seen looks more like the raimi  style also..which is a huge plus.. it looks like they were actually paying attention this time around..sometimes, you dont mess with a classic !we finally get to see the lizard  (aka dr, curt connors)  in action.  for me this was the saving grace of this film  since we have been teased about the lizard since spidey 1.. and the lizard was always one of my favorite bad guys ..  they did a great job on the make up as well as the cg effects..sure people griped about it..again, you cant make everybody happy.also, no J Jonah jameson? wtf  that was a big mistake too..hopefully he will be in the next one..he has to be, because he was important in the early days of spideys crime fighting career with causing the whole spider-man hero or menace? theme with the daily bugle..plus he was peters first boss.. j.k. simmons needs to be called back to reprise the role..because NOBODY could do the character justice like he did !the cast here is a mixed bag..dennis leary as capt stacey didnt work for me(kept thinking of his ""lock and load"" comedy special the whole time:) ..somebody a bit older should have been cast in that role..emma stone was wonderful as gwen stacey.  martin sheen was a great uncle ben.. i liked his version better than cliff robertson's...sally field as aunt may..didnt work to me  she looked too young and dare i say hot.. and wasnt believeable in the role to me...rosemary harris did a excellent job as aunt may and  should have been asked to reprise the role..andrew garfield's spider-man/peter parker  was too twitchy at times...sure, he has his moments  but to me they really should have casted somebody  better...im not saying he was bad in the role..but he didnt scream parker to me.. you couldnt  relate with him.. tobey magure, on the hand nailed the role perfectly.. plus that hair on garfield needs to be cut..pronto! chop chop!  today!the darker tone to this film actually works on some levels and was welcomed .. you knew what they were going for in this one..and if u noticed  spidey only ventured out at night..they kept that urban vigilante vibe that worked well in the early books..and later in the film  he starts to gain some respect and  is on the way to becoming a true a hero..that uncle ben  would have been  proud of...all said and done..the amazing spider-man is a fun ride... but needs more heart..in the marvel style..",3,A mixed bag...  its  missing something..,1365724800,"04 12, 2013",2013,6336,"['was', 're', 'watching', 'amazing', 'spider', 'man', 'last',

1418028,A2GBMLJM53M0FZ,B004LWZWFQ,PJA,"[8, 13]","Any director taking on an iconic superhero has to walk a tightrope between slavish (boring) adherence to the character's traditions; and 're-imagining' the figure to excess, until it is either (1)a parody of itself (2)unrecognizable (3)something only the director's mother would love.Unfortunately, ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" ends up with a little of all 3 issues, in addition to a very weak script, (poor) video-game quality effects and the conversion of a legacy villain from classic to generic.First-off, the effects (which are a decade advanced from what Sam Raimi had to work with) are jumpy and clearly digital; with none of the organic feeling that you get watching the legendary 'El' battle between Spidey and Doc Ock in 'Spider-Man II'.On the plus-side, Andrew Garfield's interpretation of Peter Parker hits a lot of grace notes, early on. He captures the paradox of a smart kid with courage, who is also an intensely private and wounded individual. As such, he is definitely more of a 'today' high school student than Toby McGuire's interpretation. Sadly, once he turns into Spidey, his performance becomes more and more quirky, until it approaches self-parody.Emma Stone as Stacy, is luminous...and, is a very talented actress. Incredibly, despite this being a comic-book character with decades of history, the role is written with barely one-dimension; and the chemistry between the leads is so lacking that I still have trouble believing they are dating in real-life. It is never explained how she is simultaneously a mentor in high school (to vile...yet easily rehabilitated...bully Flash), a top student at the same school, the assistant of Dr. Curt Connors/The Lizard and still gets to spend a lot of time at home with her family. By the way, her dad is a NYC cop, who can afford an apartment comparable to Lois Lane's in the first 'Superman' movie. Internal Affairs will be investigating.Rhys Ifans brings a very British, almost Victorian and definitely plummy reading to the role of Dr. Curt Connors/The Lizard. His hooded glances, sotto voce remarks and grandeloquent statements are jarring in a modern, NYC setting. Worse, once in CGI 'costume' as The Lizard, he lets all restraint lose and bellows the bad lines that were written for him (possibly because they were so painful for a noted actor to read?). In the comics, Dr. Curt Connors was a loving family man and mentor to Peter Parker; who became a monster while trying to do scientific good. This duality created the frisson underlying the Spider-Man/Lizard conflict. In this movie, The Lizard has been so stripped of any back story and personality, that he reminds one of nothing so much as a rejected character from 'Galaxy Quest'.Dennis Leary, as Stone's cop-father does the best that he can with (yet another) under-written part. It starts promisingly with the stereo dislike he develops for 'vigilante' Spider-Man, and his daughter's mouthy new boyfriend...Peter Parker. But it doesn't go any further; and, in the end, he's just another example of the screenwriters' lack of talent for developing characters you can either care for, or happily 'boo'.To be fair to the screenwriters, director Marc Webb bears most of the responsibility for this underachievement. His talent for teen-bizarro behavior is evident in his earlier '500 Days Of Summer'; but, he is not a director of action flicks. Aside from the Halo-grade CGI, the pacing and staging of his Spidey/Lizard battles have no drama, no peril...and, therefore, no visceral excitement.This reboot is much better than Sam Raimi's 'Spider-Man III'; but, that is faint praise, indeed. whether considered as a filmed narrative, comic-book movie, or the visualization of a myth, it is...at best...mediocre. Stick with the excellent Raimi 'Spider-Man' and superb 'Spider-Man II' if you need a fix of your friendly neighborhood webslinger.That's it...I'm off the bloody soapbox.PJA",3,Did we really need an MTV version of Spider-Man?,1352419200,"11 9, 2012",2012,3907,"['director', 'taking', 'iconic', 'superhero', 'walk', 'tightrope', 'slavish', 'boring', 'adherence', 'character', 'traditions', ""'re-imagining"", 'figure', 'excess', '1', 'parody', '2', 'unrecognizable', '3', 'something', 'only', 'director', 'mother', 'would', 'love.Unfortunately', 'Amazing', 'Spider-Man', 'up', 'little', '3', 'issues', 'addition', 'very', 'weak', 'script', 'poor', 'video-game', 'quality', 'effects', 'conversion', 'legacy', 'villain', 'classic', 'generic.First-off', 'effects', 'are', 'decade', 'advanced', 'what', 'Sam', 'Raimi', 'had', 'work', 'are', 'jumpy', 'clearly', 'digital', 'none', 'organic', 'feeling', 'get', 'watching', 'legendary', 'battle', 'Spidey', 'Doc', 'Ock', ""'Spider-Man"", ""II'.On"", 'plus-side', 'Andrew', 'Garfield', 'interpretation', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'lot', 'grace', 'notes', 'early', 'paradox', 'smart', 'kid', 'courage', 'who', 'also', 'intensely', 'private', 'wounded', 'individual', 'such', 'definitely', 'more', ""'today"", 'high', 'school', 'student', 'Toby', 'McGuire', 'interpretation', 'Sadly', 'once', 'Spidey', 'performance', 'more', 'more', 'quirky', 'self-parody.Emma', 'Stone', 'Stacy', 'luminous', 'very', 'talented', 'actress', 'Incredibly', 'being', 'comic-book', 'character', 'decades', 'history', 'role', 'written', 'barely', 'one-dimension', 'chemistry', 'leads', 'so', 'lacking', 'still', 'have', 'trouble', 'believing', 'are', 'dating', 'real-life', 'never', 'explained', 'how', 'simultaneously', 'mentor', 'high', 'school', 'vile', 'yet', 'easily', 'rehabilitated', 'bully', 'Flash', 'top', 'student', 'same', 'school', 'assistant', 'Dr.', 'Curt', 'Connors/The', 'Lizard', 'still', 'spend', 'lot', 'time', 'home', 'family', 'way', 'dad', 'NYC', 'cop', 'who', 'can', 'afford', 'apartment', 'comparable', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'first', ""'Superman"", 'movie', 'Internal', 'Affairs', 'will', 'be', 'investigating.Rhys', 'Ifans', 'very', 'British', 'almost', 'Victorian', 'definitely', 'plummy', 'reading', 'role', 'Dr.', 'Curt', 'Connors/The', 'Lizard', 'hooded', 'glances', 'sotto', 'voce', 'remarks', 'grandeloquent', 'statements', 'are', 'jarring', 'modern', 'NYC', 'setting', 'Worse', 'once', 'CGI', ""'costume"", 'Lizard', 'restraint', 'lose', 'bad', 'lines', 'were', 'written', 'possibly', 'were', 'so', 'painful', 'noted', 'actor', 'read', 'comics', 'Dr.', 'Curt', 'Connors', 'was', 'loving', 'family', 'man', 'mentor', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'who', 'became', 'monster', 'trying', 'do', 'scientific', 'good', 'duality', 'created', 'frisson', 'underlying', 'Spider-Man/Lizard', 'conflict', 'movie', 'Lizard', 'been', 'so', 'stripped', 'back', 'story', 'personality', 'one', 'nothing', 'so', 'much', 'rejected', 'character', ""'Galaxy"", ""Quest'.Dennis"", 'Leary', 'Stone', 'cop-father', 'best', 'can', 'yet', 'under-written', 'part', 'promisingly', 'stereo', 'dislike', ""'vigilante"", 'Spider-Man', 'daughter', 'mouthy', 'new', 'boyfriend', 'Peter', 'Parker', ""n't"", 'go', 'further', 'end', 'just', 'example', 'screenwriters', 'lack', 'talent', 'developing', 'characters', 'can', 'care', 'happily', ""'boo'.To"", 'be', 'fair', 'screenwriters', 'director', 'Marc', 'Webb', 'most', 'responsibility', 'underachievement', 'talent', 'teen-bizarro', 'behavior', 'evident', 'earlier', ""'500"", 'Days', 'Summer', 'not', 'director', 'action', 'flicks', 'Aside', 'Halo-grade', 'CGI', 'pacing', 'staging', 'Spidey/Lizard', 'battles', 'have', 'drama', 'peril', 'therefore', 'visceral', 'excitement.This', 'reboot', 'much', 'better', 'Sam', 'Raimi', ""'Spider-Man"", 'III', 'faint', 'praise', 'indeed', 'considered', 'filmed', 'narrative', 'comic-book', 'movie', 'visualization', 'myth', 'best', 'mediocre', 'Stick', 'excellent', 'Raimi', ""'Spider-Man"", 'superb', ""'Spider-Man"", 'II', 'need', 'fix', 'friendly', 'neighborhood', 'webslinger.That', ""'m"", 'bloody', 'soapbox.PJA']",The Amazing Spider-Man

Film Critic, Raven Devanney's review:The Amazing Spider Man starring Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone definitely lives up to its title because it is truly amazing. I was excepting this film to be an add on to the most recent Spider Man series, but it was a completely different film that started at the beginning of Spider Man's journey. Of course, Peter Parker played by Andrew Garfield was bit by a genetically modified spider and transforms into Spider Man.  His uncle Ben dies and that's all the same in the past films about this spandex-sporting hero, but instead of falling for his typical love interest, MJ, Peter falls for Gwen Stacy played by Emma Stone. And there is no Green Goblin in this film, but instead a new villain for Spider Man to face.I loved this movie! The special effects were phenomenal, especially in 3D. I loved Andrew Garfield as the part of Peter Parker because he did a fantastic job portraying him and he and Emma Stone have such great chemistry which really showed in their characters. My favorite scene is when peter is transforming into Spider Man because his aunt and uncle have no idea what's wrong with him and it's so funny. In fact, this whole film is filled with comedy and action. My favorite character would have to be Gwen Stacy played by Emma stone because I really admire her and she did a wonderful job playing this role.I think something that is very different about this film is that it seems that the target audience is just teens, where as in the past Spider Man movies the main audience was teens and adults. Overall I give the Amazing Spider Man 5 out of 5 stars because it was amazing and I want to see it over and over again.

Emma Stone was cute. Rhys Ifans was ok, although I didn't connect with him that much as a compelling character. Now this is MY feeling about this movie in my heart so I'm being honest to myself. When I see a movie, good, bad or in between, I feel what that particular movie is. I just could not fall in love with this movie like I did Raimi's. Well, the first two. This was far better than the third. To me, this movie lacked the charm of the first two of this franchise. Yes, this had a few more serious moments to make it real, but not enough to separate it from the originals. Contrary to some reviews I've read, the originals had their serious moments too. But I think they had more balance. Once again, 3 notwithstanding. Another issue being that this felt too familiar. Even Connors came off like Norman Osborne in the first Spiderman, but I was into Norman's character more. Spiderman has always been my number two favorite superhero behind Batman and followed by Superman in third. I think mainly this reboot was just too soon for me. I still think of and love the first two. And part 3 wasn't Batman & Robin bad that it needed a speedy remake like Batman needed and Superman NEEDS. But now that it's here, maybe a sequel can separate itself and become truly special. This didn't dazzle me like The Avengers and The Dark Knight Rises would really have to suck(I don't see that it will) to rank this above that epic. The Amazing Spiderman is a good time. Judge for yourself. Personally, besides the obvious being The Avengers and TDKR, the only other superhero movie I'm excited about is next year's new Superman movie, Man of Steel.

We all agreed this was the best of all the Spiderman movies. At first look I didnt think Emma and certainly not Andrew could pull it off, but much to my suprise, they both did amazing and believable jobs in their roles. I particularly liked how Emma was allowed to be smart and have an active role, not just a victim to be saved, and Andrew WAS Spiderman. He was quirky and goofy and awkward, all very endearing qualities for someone who then transforms into a vigilante hero.  He was awfully cute in this role and looking like someone who could actually BE bullied made the role that much more believable. I also really liked the emotion by them both in the emotional scenes. Andrew was AMAZING in his emotional scenes. As to the giant lizard? He was cool. Some parts of the movie were kind of over the top but hey, this movie is for fun, not life or death. Its ENTERTAINMENT. I also really liked the end where the booms lined up... oh yeah, not going to spoil it, but to see the blue collar workers help out Spidey? yes, liked it very much.

1418044,AUDW8J8GH0IDO,B004LWZWFQ,"ReAgent 6 ""Mixed media: movies, music and wha...","[1, 2]","It's hard to review a movie based on such an iconic character like Spider-Man. Stan Lee and Steve Ditko created Spider-Man back in the early 1960s and I'm sure they had no idea that they would be creating a hero with such a wide and long-lasting appeal. And so, how you judge this movie may ultimately depend on where you stand and when you were born. Characters like Superman, Batman and The Hulk are so universal in concept, that we are only given translations and versions. That's the beauty and tragic hurdle for any franchise-player-based movie to deal with.My first (and definitive) Spider-Man is from the 1960s [ahem to the age nod] and I'm sure for many it is 1981 Saturday cartoon Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends. We were just given the triple-play from Sam Raimi starring Toby Maguire and Kirsten Dunst. This film will most likely serve as the main comparison point for any kind of modern following- especially since comic books are no longer the staple story-carrier for so many super-heroes.The previous series (Spider-Man 2002) slowly turned away from the Spider-Man character and focused more on the relationship between the alter-ego Peter Parker and the girl-next-door, Mary Jane [Watson]. Amazing follows the original comic book story a bit more closely by introducing classmate Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone) as Parker's love interest -and returning to the budding scientist aspect by making the web devices an invention as opposed to an evolved part of his mutated arachnid-abilities. The casting is well done as The Lizard (Rhys Ifans), the Police Captain (Denis Leary), Uncle Ben and Aunt May (Martin Sheen and Sally Field) all add star power and credibility to the new reboot without too much time developing their back stories. We have to take this move seriously. And that's part of the new tone. It's a much darker world for Peter Parker [not that the last trilogy wasn't bleak enough] where the kind of events that took tragic turns in previous movies (like the death of Ben) seem much more weighted in overall heaviness. Toby Macguire's Spider-Man struggled with the trappings of everyday life, this Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) is dealing with EVERYTHING. His parents, his guardians, his school and mostly his own identity- and that's before even being bit by the spider!The question of Who am I? has always been a central theme for super-hero stories. It's what gives purpose and drives the characters forward and gives meaning to the actions (and the sometimes violent encounters) we see unfolding before us. We need to empathize with the hero, hate and fear the villain- with a small amount left for understanding why he does evil. We need to want the girl or at least want to see them together by the end. We need to feel his triumph and overcome the low points with him. If you accomplish some of these, the move becomes a journey and The Amazing Spider-Man achieves this with only a few bumps along the way.I won't swing off on the choice to reboot the franchise. I certainly don't think spidey needed one or even this one so soon. As I understand, there were some crossed ideas over the direction of the series and Marvel just can't let its flagship character stay stuck. The writers James Vanderbilt, Steve Kloves [lots of Harry Potter film work] and Alvin Sargent [Spider-man 2 and 3] write a fast moving script that leans a little too much on coincidences. You can't help but think `plot-device much?' when you see the intertwining of important characters. We also have some bad slapstick moments, but at least the Spider-Man one-line-zingers are relatively funny and in the true spirit of the wise-cracking web slinger.Speaking of web slinging, we have some great choreography for both the fight scenes and the skyscraper Tarzan-like vinework. We even have a more spider-y Spider-Man (and Peter Parker) as arachnid movements and tendencies are molded into the characters. We have the classic touch of a newly bit Parker catching a fly and a scene where Spider-man actually waits in the center of his web for his prey to trip and trigger his web-net. Well done.We also have the ubiquitous New York head nod as the common folk of the city rally together to help spidey. I thought we saw enough of that in the recent trilogy, but I guess Spider-Man is such a New York staple, it bears revisiting again.The movie ends on a somber, yet promising note for the future. It's a perfect ending because that's my exact opinion of the movie. It was a good movie and goes beyond `worth watching' because we are seeing another version of one of our most beloved superheroes. The new Spider-Man is treading on familiar cobwebs and hoping to create a new strand to swing from. I will admit I'm not as thrilled with the reboot as I could be, but this movie has created a solid framework to build from. I'm not a movie critic; I'm just critiquing a movie.",3,Movie Review The Amazing Spider-Man (2012),1353715200,"11 24, 2012",2012,4874,"['hard', 'review', 'movie', 'based', 'such', 'iconic',

1418049,A39W3263A9HCMN,B004LWZWFQ,"Renfield ""Up the Irons""","[5, 12]","Warning, there's a few spoilers!I'll admit I was a tad skeptical about the movie. Not in a bad way, but I was unsure if the series really needed a reboot. Sure the third movie sucked, but to have seen a follow-up to it would have been a good idea. However, after seeing an advance screening of this movie in IMAX 3D tonight, I Rescind all my doubts.No, really. This movie is spectacular. Everything about it was just... Awesome. In fact, if anything, the Raimi movies don't really interest me anymore, no matter how much I loved SM2. I know that's a bold statement to make, but seriously, this film fixes everything wrong with the Raimi movies, and is definitely more than just an apology for Spider Man 3.For one, it all starts with the tone. From the opening scene where Peter gets ready for a game of Hide and Seek, there's shades of Nolan's Batman movies in it. Throughout the movie there is an air of neo-noir, in a similar fashion to ""Drive""- even the score hints to a bit of a film noir feel. It suits the film because if anything this is an origin story before a superhero movie. The dark and gritty tone still stays consistent throughout, even in the action scenes.The story might not be totally original but it all comes down to how they handle it, and they sure handle it well. How Peter finds the clues to an unfinished experiment in Uncle Ben's flooded basement, and how he manages to piece the algorithm together with Curtis Connors. They do a good job of balancing out the origin story and the action, I dare say! And the chemistry between Gwen and Peter was very believable too. They didn't devote too much time to the love story, which is always a good thing. The contrast between Peter and Curtis is fantastic as well, and if anything is one of the better hero/villain chemistry works in recent years.As for the action scenes? INCREDIBLE. I must say, I love how they kept them grounded and realistic,saving the epic sweep until the big finale. They scrapped the campy and over the top feel of the original movies and give us rough and brutal fights, just how we want it. Garfield handles the action well and you can tell he did a lot of his own stunts too. The fight scenes between Spider Man and Lizard were fantastic, especially the grand finale in the Oscorp tower at the end!And the acting. I must say the acting was fantastic. Garfield KNOCKED IT OUT OF THE PARK, here. MacGuire was too much of a metrosexual pansy for me to take him seriously. Garfield is a total nerd, and as a result, he gets the role right. He even looks nerdy, and it helps as well. The way he manages to hold back his British accent is extraordinary as well, and his humourous kick he adds to the character works too. Emma Stone is fantastic as Gwen Stacy and adds real depth to the character, in an almost unexpected way. Her and Peter Parker's chemistry works on every level. Ifans is a great villain, and he manages to add an air of sympathy to the villain, making his transformation into the Lizard very tragic and poignant. And Leary... Well, what can we say? Brilliant and funny as usual, he even ad libs a few lines, and you'll know which lines those are (""do I look like the mayor of Tokyo?!"").In short, Webb, Stone, Garfield and Ifans have knocked one out of the park. An absolutely stellar effort thanks to great talent and I can assure you that I  will be seeing the movie again. And I can also assure you that this is a must see, with tons of action, intrigue, humour and dark tone as well.

You know, a new story, new characters...stuff like that.What a shock then, to discover that ""The Amazing Spider Man"" is essentially a remake of the very first Spider Man installment. Peter Parker gets beaten up by bullies at school, he gets bitten by a spider, he realizes that stuff sticks to his body, he gets revenge on the bullies, he disappoints Uncle Ben and Aunt May, Uncle Ben gets shot, he goes around catching villains, particularly the one who shot uncle Ben, the New York Police issues a warrant for Spider Man's arrest....blah blah blah. Hasn't this been done ten years ago? Why, yes it has. And much, much better I might add.What would be the point of re-introducing Spider Man to movie audiences in 2012? It's a rhetorical question, of course, since the answer would be to make more money. Remake the first movie; slap a new poster on it since the kids of today wouldn't catch wind of it because they are so monumentally stupid, and start rebuilding a franchise. Money, money, money! The remake has become the new Hollywood cash machine, and nobody seems to notice or care. Hollywood is f&#*ing up the great classics with newer, insipid and mediocre versions.

J Rey,"[1, 1]","Director Marc Webb (500 Says of Summer) brings new life to Marvel Comics' wall-crawling hero in the fun-filled superhero adventure The Amazing Spider-Man. Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) is a nerdy high school student and social outcast who attempts to discover the truth behind his parents disappearance when he was young, but a strange twist of fate leads him to the life as New York City's friendly neighborhood Spider-Man. Parker will need all his special skills and courage to stop his father's former partner, research scientist Curt Connors (Rhys Ifans), who has developed a revolutionary regeneration serum that transforms him into a monstrous 9-foot tall reptile. As a reboot of the popular film franchise, The Amazing Spider-Man preserves many of the key elements of the previous Sam Raimi films, but Marc Webb adds some of his own creativity to the mix. Despite its darker tone, the film features some amusingly lighthearted and comedic moments, impressive visual effects and rousing excitement. The Amazing Spider-Man also stars Emma Stone, Denis Leary, Martin Sheen and Sally Field.The Blu-Ray release of The Amazing Spider-Man is certainly top-notch. The superhero adventure is presented in its theatrical 2.35:1 format. Its High Definition digital transfer is quite incredible with stunning detail y rich colors. Its 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio is also remarkable. The Blu-Ray features a feature-length audio commentary track with director Marc Webb and producers Avi Arad and Matt Tolmach, over 16 minutes of deleted scenes, storyboards, animated sequences, an interactive picture gallery, behind-the-scene footage, and the seven-part documentary Rite of Passage: The Amazing Spider-Man Reborn.

1418069,AHBNPMHDWZ7SB,B004LWZWFQ,RJ Smoove,"[0, 0]","As a huge fan of Raimi's trilogy, yes even the well hated third, I was cautious and skeptical about this reboot. That isn't to say that I wasn't excited about it though. I was very much looking forward to Mark Webb's take on the classic lore of such an awesome character. Off the bat, I preferred the casting and cinematography in this film to Raimi's, but I questioned if Webb (who gave us one of my all-time favorite romantic comedies in (500) Days of Summer) could deliver the action that a high-flying acrobatic hero like Spidey should bring. I'm happy to say he did.There are a good number of Spidey moments and poses that should excite any geek that has a history with the comics. And the web-shooters, yes! Finally non-organic web-shooters. The classic idea of Peter running out of his webbing when he was in the heat of battle was captured very nicely in this film. I've read the complaints about the teenage love between Gwen Stacy and Peter being too Twilight-esque, and to those people I ask, ""Have you ever read a Spider-Man comic?""The love stories between he and his different love interests (be it Gwen Stacy, or Mary Jane Watson) have always been prominent. And believe it, or not, teenage love did exist long before Twilight was ever conceived, and it will be around for many decades to come. So let's end the constant mentioning of Twilight every time teenagers in films have romantic relationships. Besides, I felt like Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone were so well casted and played so well off of each other, that I believed their characters.As for our villain, the Lizard was a villain that we had been waiting to see manifest ever since we first caught a glimpse of the one-armed Dylan Baker in Spider-Man 2, and I feel like Rhys Ifans take on the character was as good as I expected it to be. Sure, there is room for improvement (namely the physical design, and his speech -- I wanted to hear hisses when he spoke), but that's just my opinion. It didn't take away from my enjoyment of the film. The CG was very good, from his scales and wounds, all the way down to peeling skin and wrinkles. And at least Conners was a very well fleshed out character with his alter-ego having a sense of genuine purpose and presence, as opposed to being a hulking brute that only served as fight scene fodder, and best of all, he's still alive. So will we see more of him in the future?Maybe, maybe not, but he's still alive in that universe for possible future exploration. The connection we get to Peter's quest for self, and to his relationship with his birth parents and adopted parents are wonderful, in my opinion. I loved Martin Sheen, Sally Field, and Andrew Garfield's charisma and interaction. As for the Blu-ray treatment, it's a technically flawless presentation. There should be no questioning of the audio or picture quality. And thankfully, the extras are thorough! A great commentary and an in-depth Making-of documentary. Plus other little extras, like Deleted Scenes, etc. I highly recommend this one.

1418072,AO6L5RJILSLDX,B004LWZWFQ,"R. Long ""Tessie's Boy""","[4, 7]","Let me get this out of the way first: as a film, The Amazing Spider-Man is not on the same level of any of the films in Sam Raimi's Spider-Man trilogy; not even the much-maligned Spider-Man 3, which was released a scant five years ago.  Love them or hate them, Raimi's takes on everybody's favorite wallcrawler were heartfelt, quirky and idiosyncratic, a sensibility that meshed well with Marvel's quirkiest and most idiosyncratic superhero.  Tobey Maguire's Peter Parker wore his heart on his sleeve.  He was sensitive--maybe a little too sensitive, actually; he seemed to sling more tears than he did webs. But his performance was emblematic of the original Spider-Man trilogy as a whole: it had heart, to a fault.Like many others, I was not exactly enthusiastic about a reboot of Spider-Man so quickly after the first series ended.  (Although I was less than thrilled with Spider-Man 3, I was willing to cut Raimi and company some slack, as the corporate-mandated shoehorning of Venom into the plot threw off the balance of the entire movie.)  It just smacked of a cash grab and a well-publicized desperate move on Sony's part to stop the Spider-Man license from reverting to Marvel.  Compound that with the fact that it was stuffed in the summer between two bigger, better and more anticipated superhero films, The Avengers and The Dark Knight Rises, and this new Spider-Man was an easy miss for me.  When I finally did get an opportunity to see the new version, I learned that I was both right and wrong in dismissing The Amazing Spider-Man.  I was struck by two things: one, the cynical, blatant marketing calculation that went into constructing the story; two, how the character of Peter Parker/Spider-Man was portrayed.On the story: The Amazing Spider-Man is a summer blockbuster that is trying very hard to be THE Summer Blockbuster.  No clich&eacute; is left unused, no demographic left unappealed to in Sony's bid for box office dollars.  The villain in this piece, The Lizard (played without much depth by Rhys Ifans) is just big and scary enough to be a credible threat to our hero, but just bland and nondescript enough that parents won't leave the younger kids at home in favor of the preteens; after all, if they take away that demo, how will they sell the kids toys?  (For contrast, read the early issues of Todd MacFarlane's ""Spider-Man"" from 1991 to know what a terrifying character the Lizard can truly be.)  It also continues the trend of schmaltz in the Spider-Man cinematic universe, encapsulated here by the crane scene (no spoilers, when you see the film you will know what I'm referring to).  But the heightened sentimentality that felt earned in the Raimi trilogy--especially in the first film, which was released mere months after 9/11--only feels mawkish and insincere here.  Also, the Amazing Spider-Man, even more so than the Raimi trilogy, plays fast and loose with established continuity.  After a dozen years or so of big-budget Marvel comics adaptations, I fully recognize the fact that film is a different medium, and what works in the comics often will not work on the screens, and filmmakers have to have the freedom to adapt the material as they see fit, and so on and so forth.  But aside from the (re)telling of the origin story, the plot points in The Amazing Spider-Man are so jumbled as to smack of disrespect for the source material.In the middle of this mess of a movie stands the main reason why TASM is worth watching: the characters of Peter Parker/Spider-Man, Gwen Stacy, and Peter's Uncle Ben and Aunt May.  Whatever flaws the film itself has, I can say unreservedly that this is the first time I've ever felt truly satisfied with the portrayal of Spider-Man onscreen.  First of all, Andrew Garfield, unlike Tobey Maguire, physically looks like the Peter Parker of the comics.  This Peter Parker still has a big heart, but he is tougher (without being tough); he's gangly, gawky, and yet lithe and muscular enough that you could believe he could be a total science nerd or a buff superhero.  And speaking of the superheroics, the Raimi trilogy was never particularly convincing on that score; for all the CGI effects and for all the TALK of what Spider-Man could do, when the action was live, it didn't feel like Spider-Man.  It felt like an above-average athlete wearing a suit; watching Spider-Man move is supposed to feel, well, amazing!  Here, the webslinger in action moves like an arachnid on speed and wisecracks like nobody's business.  Yes, folks, this Spider-Man is actually funny, rectifying what I considered to be the cardinal sin of the previous three movies.The character of Gwen Stacy also fares well in comparison with Kirsten Dunst's Mary Jane Watson.  As played by Emma Stone, Gwen is spunky, very cute, and more than an intellectual match for Peter, where Dunst's Mary Jane was often more closed off and sometimes unsure of their relationship.  The chemistry between real-life couple Garfield and Stone is fun, spark-filled and very lively, yet shares the same basic sweetness with the more old-fashioned, almost courtly romance of Peter & Mary Jane from the Raimi films.  Martin Sheen and Sally Field also bring an earthiness and sense of humor to Uncle Ben and Aunt May that the impossibly moral figures of the Raimi films lacked.  Sheen, in particular, turns Uncle Ben from the near-saintly figure comic fans have heard about for fifty years now (!!I'm old!!) into a very human guy from Queens who still has a real moral authority, but is also prone to being short-tempered and a bit sarcastic.  Sally Field doesn't make quite the same impression (mainly because, I assume, the character will be explored a bit more in the inevitable sequels), but she too manages bring out the more relatable aspects of May's character.Taken on its own merits, The Amazing Spider-Man is perhaps the first of what will soon become a very weird niche in films, should Hollywood continue the way it's going: a reboot worse than the original, but with a better cast.  It's odd to think about.  Sam Raimi's trilogy was a superior series of films that captured the heart and the feel of the Spider-Man universe, but not the complete essence of the main character.  This new film (soon to be series) finally nails the character of Spider-Man himself, but manages to make the world around him feel false and contrived.  Maybe one day we will get a perfect meshing of character and universe onscreen, but for now, this still isn't it.",3,A Diamond In The Rough,1352332800,"11 8, 2012",2012,6483,"['Let', 'get', 'out',

Though I like Emma Stone as an actress, I didn't think she was right for Gwen, nor did I take to Andrew Garfield as Peter. I did like Denis Leary as Gwen's father. El Lizardo (the villain) was a disaster. The reason Sony made this film in the first place (too quicklly) was so the studio wouldn't lose the Spider-Man rights to Marvel Entertainment (and to rival studio, Disney). Surely, if Sony had wanted to make another Spider-Man they should have considered the feelings of the viewers, then write a GOOD script, and cast actors who fit their roles. 'The (not-so) Amazing Spider-Man' was boring and unspectacular (isn't there a comic book also called 'The Spectacular Spider-Man'???). Another film is in the works.

Spider-Man in my opinion is one of the very best super-heros and in many ways the ""Spider-Man"" series brought the Superhero genre to its peak.  Spider-Man, apart from his super-powers, is an ordinary guy with ordinary problems.  Peter Parker was a nerd before the word ""nerd"" was invented.  Fans of the comic book series loved this aspect of the story -- Peter was a regular guy who was about as screwed up as most of us were in our early and mid-teens.  Bookworms like me could relate to Peter and dislike popular, good looking, girl-getting, superior in all respect jocks like Flash Thompson, who was prominent in the early Spider-Man stories.  Further, the comic stories were unusually well-written for the comic book genre.The point of this film is that Peter Parker in this story is more true to life than in the original ""Spider-Man"" movies.  He is awkward and nerdish.  My main criticism of the story line is that Peter quickly wins over Gwen Stacy and cannot wait to blurt out his secret identity to her, and later her cop father.  In the original comic series Peter was fanatically secretive about his secret identity and never revealed it to anyone until much later when he gets married.  Here, he wins the girl straightaway (the lovely Gwen Stacy -- are those dresses hot or what?) and departs from the Peter Parker that old fans like myself knew and loved.For all that this is a pretty good film.  I liked the way that they modernized the plot in terms of how Peter got his super-powers, and how Connors becomes ""The Lizard.""  The Lizard episode in the comic strip was one of my very favorites, by the way.  Mostly it is done fairly well here, and the storyline does a very good job explaining it.Enjoyable, especially after watching it a second time with my son.

I felt Tobey did a great job as Spidey and a Spiderman movie without him is just not the same.  The other bad casting role was Sally Field.  I am sorry but she is not an Aunt May.  The previous actress was so much better as Aunt May and she even looked like her.  All other actors were phenominal in my opinion.This Spiderman was an OK movie.  I really did enjoy it but there were a lot of plot holes.  Where is Uncle Ben's killer?  No mention at the end about his continued search?  And the scene with the little lizards running around NYC?  Can someone show me a real living lizard in NY (besides the Bronx zoo)?  And how many times can I watch Uncle Ben get shot?Nothing beats the original movie with the Green Goblin.  As a New Yorker that lived through 9/11, I remember seeing the movie back in 2002 and something about it touched me in a deep way.  Watching Spidey save a baby from a burning building... swinging around and saving people on the streets of Manhattan.  It was a ground breaking movie (delivered at the right time) and the only movie in my life that I enjoyed watching more than once in the theater.  I felt like I was watching the same movie again just 10 years later with a different actor playing Spiderman that couldn't even act.Bottom line... this was a pretty good movie considering the garbage out there in the theaters.  I did enjoy it but there were things that really bothered me.  Unfortunately, I can't help but compare this to the original Rami movie which is part of the problem with this movie.  Did we really need a reboot or did we really want to see Spiderman 4?  All we needed was another ""Spiderman 2"" caliber type of movie directed by Rami and Toby as Spiderman featuring the Lizard as the one and only bad guy.  The movie studio would have made even more money if they did this right.However, I think there is a lot of potential in the sequels of this movie.  Hopefully Garfield will mature more as an actor and get away from this drugged up Peter Parker with a hood and backpack so he won't look like a criminal.  Only time will tell.",3,TWILIGHT MEETS SPIDEY,1342051200,"07 12, 2012",2012,2712,"['was', ""n't"", 'going', 'see', 'junk', 'kept', 'watching', 'trailers', 'figured', 'would', 'give', 'chance', 'more', 'curiousity', 'just', 'compare', 'Rami', 'version', '.This', 'movie', 'was', 'entertaining', 'enjoyed', 'had', 'cast', 'full', 'top', 'notch', 'actors', 'did', 'not', 'like', 'Garfield', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'was', 'nothing', 'personal', 'just', 'feel', 'can', 'not', 'act', 'performance', 'gave', 'was', 'typical', 'kid', 'today', 'prescription', 'drug', 'medications', 'Mumbled', 'speech', 'hood', 'constantly', 'head', 'dumb', 'backpack', 'why', 'say', 'movie', 'twilight', 'younger', 'generation', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'true', 'Spiderman', 'fans', 'felt', 'Tobey', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'Spidey', 'Spiderman', 'movie', 'just', 'not', 'same', 'other', 'bad', 'casting', 'role', 'was', 'Sally', 'Field', 'am', 'sorry', 'not', 'Aunt', 'May', 'previous', 'actress', 'was', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'Aunt', 'May', 'even', 'looked', 'other', 'actors', 'were', 'phenominal', 'opinion.This', 'Spiderman', 'was', 'OK', 'movie', 'really', 'did', 'enjoy', 'were', 'lot', 'plot', 'holes', 'Where', 'Uncle', 'Ben', 'killer', 'mention', 'end', 'continued', 'search', 'scene', 'little', 'lizards', 'running', 'around', 'NYC', 'Can', 'someone', 'show', 'real', 'living', 'lizard', 'NY', 'Bronx', 'zoo', 'how', 'many', 'times', 'can', 'watch', 'Uncle', 'Ben', 'get', 'shot', 'Nothing', 'original', 'movie', 'Green', 'Goblin', 'New', 'Yorker', 'lived', '9/11', 'remember', 'seeing', 'movie', 'back', '2002', 'something', 'touched', 'deep', 'way', 'Watching', 'Spidey', 'save', 'baby', 'burning', 'building', 'swinging', 'around', 'saving', 'people', 'streets', 'Manhattan', 'was', 'ground', 'breaking', 'movie', 'delivered', 'right', 'time', 'only', 'movie', 'life', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'more', 'once', 'theater', 'felt', 'was', 'watching', 'same', 'movie', 'again', 'just', '10', 'years', 'later', 'different', 'actor', 'playing', 'Spiderman', 'could', ""n't"", 'even', 'act.Bottom', 'line', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'movie', 'considering', 'garbage', 'there', 'theaters', 'did', 'enjoy', 'were', 'things', 'really', 'bothered', 'Unfortunately', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'compare', 'original', 'Rami', 'movie', 'part', 'problem', 'movie', 'Did', 'really', 'need', 'reboot', 'did', 'really', 'want', 'see', 'Spiderman', '4', 'needed', 'was', 'Spiderman', '2', 'caliber', 'type', 'movie', 'directed', 'Rami', 'Toby', 'Spiderman', 'featuring', 'Lizard', 'one', 'only', 'bad', 'guy', 'movie', 'studio', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'even', 'more', 'money', 'did', 'right.However', 'think', 'lot', 'potential', 'sequels', 'movie', 'Hopefully', 'Garfield', 'will', 'mature', 'more', 'actor', 'get', 'away', 'drugged', 'up', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'hood', 'backpack', 'so', 'wo', ""n't"", 'look', 'criminal', 'Only', 'time', 'will', 'tell']",The Amazing Spider-Man

1418111,A1C58YXM2A30CY,B004LWZWFQ,"Scotman's Film & Book Reviews ""Film & Book Re...","[8, 15]","Amazing SpidermanThe film is not ""better"" than Tobey MacGuire's version of Spiderman in the first film; in fact it is not really a ""remake.""  It's a reimagined version.What's best about this version?  The fact we return to the original Stan Lee(creator of the Spiderman mythos)/Steve Ditko (original artist) tale of a nerdy boy who falls for Gwen Stacy.  And like that original story, we have Captain Stacy, a kind Uncle Ben (played seriously by Martin Sheen) and a very sympathetic Aunt May (surprisingly well by Sally Field!).  We even get to see real web shooters!  (The organic shooters from the Ultimates never made sense to me - you'd run out of blood, right?  But I digress.)Themes:One theme is family.  The film starts with Richard and Mary Parker, Peter's real parents, and a mystery about their disappearance.  Did they really get killed in a crash?  Or is there something more?  It's fine that the film leaves me hanging, as it creates a mystery to see the next one, but man!Another theme is obsession.  Peter, obsessed with the murder of his uncle, wanting that burglar, whom he actually did nothing when he could have caught him.  What's interesting though is that unlike the Raimi version, we don't actually get a closure on the burglar.  Another mystery!And there is Curt Connors, who as the Lizard becomes obsessed with creating a race of lizard men (just like the comics - read it!).Characterization:  The realism is great, and the emphasis is not so much on action (though there is  plenty of that) but on family, responsibility and knowing that you have a gift that you need to use it to help others.  Peter has a gift and he wanted to help others but so did the Lizard, in his own demented way.Bottom Line:  I love a comics film that a general audience can understand without being familiar with the comics.  My philosophy has always been that a comics film has to appeal to a more general audience and not fan boys.  There were no Easter eggs for the fans in this film (but there was a fun scene with Stan Lee in a library), and I'm sure there will be Mary Jane fans wondering why she's not here.Ditko's vision lives in this film.Highly recommended.Also you may check:Spider-Man: The High Definition Trilogy (Spider-Man / Spider-Man 2 / Spider-Man 3) [Blu-ray]",4,Interesting Take on Lee/Ditko's Story!,1341360000,"07 4, 2012",2012,2281,"['Amazing', 'SpidermanThe', 'film', 'not', 'better', 'Tobey', 'MacGuire', 'version', 'Spiderman', 'first', 'film', 'fact', 'not', 'really', 'remake', 'reimagined', 'version.What', 'best', 'version', 'fact', 'return', 'original', 'Stan', 'Lee', 'creator', 'Spiderman', 'mythos', '/Steve', 'Ditko', 'original', 'artist', 'tale', 'nerdy', 'boy', 'who', 'Gwen', 'Stacy', 'original', 'story', 'have', 'Captain', 'Stacy', 'kind', 'Uncle', 'Ben', 'played', 'seriously', 'Martin', 'Sheen', 'very', 'sympathetic', 'Aunt', 'May', 'surprisingly', 'well', 'Sally', 'Field', 'even', 'get', 'see', 'real', 'web', 'shooters', 'organic', 'shooters', 'Ultimates', 'never', 'made', 'sense', ""'d"", 'run', 'out', 'blood', 'right', 'digress', 'Themes', 'One', 'theme', 'family', 'film', 'Richard', 'Mary', 'Parker', 'Peter', 'real', 'parents', 'mystery', 'disappearance', 'Did', 'really', 'get', 'killed', 'crash', 'there', 'something', 'more', 'fine', 'film', 'hanging', 'mystery', 'see', 'next', 'one', 'man', 'theme', 'obsession', 'Peter', 'obsessed', 'murder', 'uncle', 'wanting', 'burglar', 'whom', 'actually', 'did', 'nothing', 'when', 'could', 'have', 'caught', 'What', 'interesting', 'though', 'Raimi', 'version', 'do', ""n't"", 'actually', 'get', 'closure', 'burglar', 'mystery', 'Curt', 'Connors', 'who', 'Lizard', 'obsessed', 'creating', 'race', 'lizard', 'men', 'just', 'comics', 'read', '.Characterization', 'realism', 'great', 'emphasis', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'action', 'plenty', 'family', 'responsibility', 'knowing', 'have', 'gift', 'need', 'use', 'help', 'others', 'Peter', 'gift', 'wanted', 'help', 'others', 'so', 'did', 'Lizard', 'own', 'demented', 'way.Bottom', 'Line', 'love', 'comics', 'film', 'general', 'audience', 'can', 'understand', 'being', 'familiar', 'comics', 'philosophy', 'always', 'been', 'comics', 'film', 'appeal', 'more', 'general', 'audience', 'not', 'fan', 'boys', 'were', 'Easter', 'eggs', 'fans', 'film', 'was', 'fun', 'scene', 'Stan', 'Lee', 'library', ""'m"", 'sure', 'will', 'be', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'fans', 'wondering', 'why', 'not', 'here.Ditko', 'vision', 'film.Highly', 'recommended.Also', 'may', 'check', 'Spider-Man', 'High', 'Definition', 'Trilogy', 'Spider-Man', '/', 'Spider-Man', '2', '/', 'Spider-Man', '3', '[', 'Blu-ray', ']']",The Amazing Spider-Man

I didn't see this movie in the theater because I'm burnt out on origins and was excited for this, I should have seen it in the theaters.  Amazing Spider-man brings a huge plus to the franchise that has not yet been done (in my opinion) and that is believable emotion.The interaction between the characters and the acting from the actors feels like it makes sense and is something that is very real as opposed to cliche situations that are trying to mimic what happened in comic world.  I've read Lee and Ditko and I do not want to see that pulled directly onto the screen because it doesn't work as well.Parker's evolution is fantastic.  It's a transformation that felt genuine and made the moment when Peter embraces his responsibility so much more believable and therefore more meaningful and rewarding.The character work is fantastic and where the movie lacks in with larger set pieces.  Spider-man's action sequences use his powers and webbing creatively but lack and kinetic energy.  The fighting is more background noise rather exciting.

1418123,A1B9VX6MZ0MZ1T,B004LWZWFQ,Sesho,"[1, 2]","Has it really only been only five years since the last Tobey McGuire Spider-Man movie? And so with this new Spider-Man film, we're just supposed like that whole series didn't even happen? OK. Disney, could you please repeat this with the Star Wars prequels and give us the TRUE origin of Darth Vader?Yes, Sony thinks you are dumb. Half of The Amazing Spider-Man or more was just a rehash of the first McGuire movie. Don't get me wrong, Disney appears to know what it's doing when it comes to making Marvel movies. They are making a ton of money. They have sequel upon sequel coming out. They have The Avengers 2. Iron Man 3. Thor 2. Black Widow? Captain America 2. Just throw movies at the wall and see what sticks. But the thing about all these Marvel movies is that while you are watching them, they really are entertaining...but afterwards, when you really start thinking about the experience, you realize how dumb they really are. Is anyone going to care about any of these movies in 20 years? I doubt it. To me, I really could not tell a big difference between Sony and Disney's treatment of Marvel characters.But let's get back to Spider-Man. Peter Parker is a brilliant high school student played by the Hayden Christensen look alike Andrew Garfield who it appears has more acting chops than McGuire could ever dream of. In fact, he probably lays on the nerd schtick a little TOO thick. Apparently, his parents dumped him on the doorstep of his Uncle Ben and Aunt May's when he was a kid because their scientific research with radioactive spiders had put them in danger. Peter never saw them again. But when he finds an old briefcase containing his dad's research, he quickly links him to a geneticist named Curt Connors, who is currently working on cross species genetics. He even gives Dr. Connors a hand in moving his years long research to the next level, using lizard DNA to make 3 legged rats grow a new limb! Oh, and during the course of his visit, he also gets bitten by a radioactive spider AND plants the seeds for the movie's new villain, the Lizard!Am I the only person in the world who just expresses a yawn over all the new Marvel movies? These characters are so old and worn out. Disney (also old and worn out) seems to think that just because you give Peter a touseled hairdo and some cool Nikes that it updates the character of Spider-Man. Peter also seemed to rely a little heavily on the internet to do his crime solving. Again, a pretty lame attempt at updating this 50 year old story.Retreading the origin story again also was a little dull. But again, this movie was not for comic book fans. It was for the great unwashed masses who have never even touched a comic in their lives. Disney does not see Marvel comics as a money maker. Now, Marvel movies, that's a completely different proposition. They don't care about the dwindling numbers of readers of their overpriced books. They only see dollar signs in the movies that exploit the fans and the characters. Woe betide Star Wars. Sony, too, could care less about the comic franchise their movies are based on.Andrew Garfield does a pretty good job imitating that skinny dude that I hate from Scott Pilgrim and that other dorky dude from Zombie Land, (which also starred Emma Stone). And when called on to really act in this movie, he succeeds admirably. Emma Stone seems poorly miscast as the stockings skirted Gwen Stacy because she looks about 35 years old in this movie. Martin Sheen does a good imitation of the Martin Sheen that he's always been along with the chick from Smokey and the Bandit who fill in for kinda surrogate parents for Peter, but really have no emotional space to work in except to worry about Peter.I will say that this film was an improvement over the Sam Raimi films, but I don't know if that's saying much. I for sure did not miss the goofiness that is so inherent in all of Sam's movies.

1418127,A1DUT6O3BWXEJ,B004LWZWFQ,"Shawn Gordon ""gordy the ghoul""","[1, 2]","The one thing that will surprise many people about the new spider-man movie, finally titled the Amazing Spider-man, is how refreshing and original it actually is. After only a decade, the filmmakers have rebooted the franchise and started anew once again telling the origins of spidey, however, the ground covered is not as much of a rehashing as one might have expected from all too often creatively bankrupt Hollywood movie system.Once again telling how mild mannered, somewhat nerdy Peter Parker became the web slinger Spider-man. With a newly designed suit that looks great in 3-D, he no longer shoots webs organically, but uses a web shooter like in the old comic books. This will surely please fan boys and girls everywhere.Peter is still a high school student, but academics take a backseat when the greater responsibility of superhero arrives. Taking on the Lizard, a.k.a Dr.  Curt Connors (Rhys Ifans), his father's former partner turned kaju inspired CGI monster. Romancing Gwen Stacey (Emma Stone), Peter's first love from the comics, dodging her suspicious father, police Lt. George Stacey (Denis Leary). And looking out for dear old Aunt May (Sally Field), now that Uncle Ben (Martin Sheen) has been gunned down by a mugger. The story may seem familiar, but it's execution is welcome.Now played by Andrew Garfield, last seen as Eduardo Saverin in last year's excellent the Social Network, who brings a good amount of charisma to the role allowing us to easily forget the banal Tobey Maguire.  Emma Stone is a good choice for the role of Gwen Stacey, with her big eyes and (natural) blonde locks. Both actors are too old for the roles, however, I am reminded of the mileage that 21 Jump Street got earlier this year kidding casting of actors too old as high schoolers. British comedian Rhys Ifans, best known for playing Hugh Grant's slobbish flat mate in Notting Hill, is a surprising choice for the villainous role, but lately he's been leaving the shaggy hair-do at home and developing his skills to be a first rate character actor. Denis Leary, hot off his long running TV series ""Rescue Me"" and voicing the Ice Age movies, makes his big screen return after a decade. Making the role of George Stacey all his own, adding his usual and much loved comic shtick, but still finding the character within, this is one of Leary's best performances. Martin Sheen is an agreeable replacement for the late Cliff Robertson in the role of Uncle Ben. While Sally Field is an inspired choice for Aunt May, she's sweet and pleasant, not as gaudy and school mar mish as Rosemary Harris in earlier Spider-man movies.Directed by Marc Webb, a music video director with only one film to his name, the truly superb (500) Days of Summer, Webb may lack Sam Raimi's over all attention grabbing style, but he has a very good sense of storytelling and like Raimi puts a strong emphasis on character. Working from a first rate script by James Vanderbit, Alvin Sargent and Steve Kloves, the tone is lighter and more pleasant allowing the viewer to see just how overly serious and often pretentious the Raimi pictures could be.Well staged and greatly filmed action scenes highlight the movie, after seeing the rather ho-hum action involved in the Dark Knight Rises, this comes as a welcome alternative. The CGI is at times over dominating, and the Lizard is a little hard on the eyes for most of his screen time. Still, this is one of the most fun and easily endearing superhero movies of recent years. The spider-man movies still remain a high water mark for the ever increasingly crowded genre.Check out my reviews at moviezonemagazine.com",4,an amazing surprise,1359504000,"01 30, 2013",2013,3628,"['one', 'thing', 'will', 'surprise', 'many', 'people', 'new', 'spider-man', 'movie', 'finally', 'titled', 'Amazing', 'Spider-man', 'how', 'refreshing', 'original', 'actually', 'only', 'decade', 'filmmakers', 'have', 'rebooted', 'franchise', 'started', 'anew', 'once', 'again', 'telling', 'origins', 'spidey', 'however', 'ground', 'covered', 'not', 'as', 'much', 'rehashing', 'one', 'might', 'have', 'expected', 'too', 'often', 'creatively', 'bankrupt', 'Hollywood', 'movie', 'system.Once', 'again', 'telling', 'how', 'mild', 'mannered', 'somewhat', 'nerdy', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'became', 'web', 'slinger', 'Spider-man', 'newly', 'designed', 'suit', 'great', '3-D', 'no', 'longer', 'shoots', 'webs', 'organically', 'web', 'shooter', 'old', 'comic', 'books', 'will', 'surely', 'please', 'fan', 'boys', 'girls', 'everywhere.Peter', 'still', 'high', 'school', 'student', 'academics', 'take', 'backseat', 'when', 'greater', 'responsibility', 'superhero', 'arrives', 'Taking', 'Lizard', 'a.k.a', 'Dr.', 'Curt', 'Connors', 'Rhys', 'Ifans', 'father', 'former', 'partner', 'turned', 'kaju', 'inspired', 'CGI', 'monster', 'Romancing', 'Gwen', 'Stacey', 'Emma', 'Stone', 'Peter', 'first', 'love', 'comics', 'dodging', 'suspicious', 'father', 'police', 'Lt.', 'George', 'Stacey', 'Denis', 'Leary', 'looking', 'out', 'dear', 'old', 'Aunt', 'May', 'Sally', 'Field', 'now', 'Uncle', 'Ben', 'Martin', 'Sheen', 'been', 'gunned', 'down', 'mugger', 'story', 'may', 'seem', 'familiar', 'execution', 'welcome.Now', 'played', 'Andrew', 'Garfield', 'last', 'seen', 'Eduardo', 'Saverin', 'last', 'year', 'excellent', 'Social', 'Network', 'who', 'good', 'amount', 'charisma', 'role', 'allowing', 'easily', 'forget', 'banal', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'Emma', 'Stone', 'good', 'choice', 'role', 'Gwen', 'Stacey', 'big', 'eyes', 'natural', 'blonde', 'locks', 'actors', 'are', 'too', 'old', 'roles', 'however', 'am', 'reminded', 'mileage', '21', 'Jump', 'Street', 'got', 'earlier', 'year', 'kidding', 'casting', 'actors', 'too', 'old', 'high', 'schoolers', 'British', 'comedian', 'Rhys', 'Ifans', 'best', 'known', 'playing', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'slobbish', 'flat', 'mate', 'Notting', 'Hill', 'surprising', 'choice', 'villainous', 'role', 'lately', 'been', 'leaving', 'shaggy', 'hair-do', 'home', 'developing', 'skills', 'be', 'first', 'rate', 'character', 'actor', 'Denis', 'Leary', 'hot', 'off', 'long', 'running', 'TV', 'series', 'Rescue', 'Me', 'voicing', 'Ice', 'Age', 'movies', 'big', 'screen', 'return', 'decade', 'Making', 'role', 'George', 'Stacey', 'own', 'adding', 'usual', 'much', 'loved', 'comic', 'shtick', 'still', 'finding', 'character', 'one', 'Leary', 'best', 'performances', 'Martin', 'Sheen', 'agreeable', 'replacement', 'late', 'Cliff', 'Robertson', 'role', 'Uncle', 'Ben', 'Sally', 'Field', 'inspired', 'choice', 'Aunt', 'May', 'sweet', 'pleasant', 'not', 'gaudy', 'school', 'mar', 'mish', 'Rosemary', 'Harris', 'earlier', 'Spider-man', 'movies.Directed', 'Marc', 'Webb', 'music', 'video', 'director', 'only', 'one', 'film', 'name', 'truly', 'superb', '500', 'Days', 'Summer', 'Webb', 'may', 'lack', 'Sam', 'Raimi', 'attention', 'grabbing', 'style', 'very', 'good', 'sense', 'storytelling', 'Raimi', 'strong', 'emphasis', 'character', 'Working', 'first', 'rate', 'script', 'James', 'Vanderbit', 'Alvin', 'Sargent', 'Steve', 'Kloves', 'tone', 'lighter', 'more', 'pleasant', 'allowing', 'viewer', 'see', 'just', 'how', 'overly', 'serious', 'often', 'pretentious', 'Raimi', 'pictures', 'could', 'be.Well', 'staged', 'greatly', 'filmed', 'action', 'scenes', 'highlight', 'movie', 'seeing', 'rather', 'ho-hum', 'action', 'involved', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'Rises', 'welcome', 'alternative', 'CGI', 'times', 'dominating', 'Lizard', 'little', 'hard', 'eyes', 'most', 'screen', 'time', 'Still', 'one', 'most', 'fun', 'easily', 'endearing', 'superhero', 'movies', 'recent', 'years', 'spider-man', 'movies', 'still', 'remain', 'high', 'water', 'mark', 'ever', 'increasingly', 'crowded', 'genre.Check', 'reviews', 'moviezonemagazine.com']",The Amazing Spider-Man

The Amazing Spiderman is definitely a different story than the one told in Raimi's initial effort, and it wasn't a bad movie...it was a good movie actually. But did it come too soon on the heels of Raimi's trilogy?I for one didn't need a retelling of how Peter Parker became Spiderman so soon after the (relatively) recent Maguire Spiderman movie(s). I'd have much preferred a new Spiderman story that just picked up where Raimi left off, albeit with a different guy (Andrew Garfield) in the lead role and a new director. But I guess Webb wanted to make the franchise his, and he sold Marvel on the idea. So, we'll just have to get our brains around that. Perhaps as Webb's continuation of the telling of Spiderman's story continues into sequel (which has been confirmed), the feeling of a little boredom and redundancy that I felt while watching the retelling part of ""how Peter became Spidey"" will dissipate.But like I said earlier, The Amazing Spiderman was still a good movie. I was definitely entertained. It was well acted, well directed and fun to watch. However, adding to the redundancy dilemma was a lack of non-stop action in a movie that ran for over 2 hours. Even after the final battle in the movie there was like 10 or 15 minutes of further dialogue and character development. The retelling of the beginning of Spiderman could have been done in way less than two hours...especially so soon after ""the other"" Spiderman movie(s).Spiderman fans, superhero movie fans...you've got a new take on Spidey to check out here.

1418139,A38X3820MO0TAN,B004LWZWFQ,Sony XL,"[2, 3]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***No one involved with this movie cared about making a good movie. Because they don't need to. The Spiderman movies will make money no matter good or bad they are. But that doesn't mean they should not try to. Why did this movie get made? Simple, Sam Raimi wasn't given enough time to make a fourth spider-man film so he quit, and the fans wanted to see the lizard on screen. This movie wasn't made for any other reason.First off, Peter Parker doesn't have a goal in this movie. At first its to find out what happened to his parents, which isn't explained in this movie. After half an hour he now tries to control his new powers, in scenes that don't help the audience. In the original spider-man, Peter learned about his powers in a controlled environment, he didn't beat up innocent people on a subway train. It's nice to know no one on that train reported that a man beat up five people while climbing walls. But Peter learning his powers can't be an entire focus in the movie, so we kill Uncle Ben. This time it doesn't work because the only reason Peter let the criminal get away was because Peter couldn't get a chocolate milk. To get so upset that he couldn't afford a chocolate milk that he would let a robber get away with the stores money is a contrivance in every way. So for about ten minutes Peters new goal is to bring uncle Ben's murderer to justice, let the police can't link all these look alike criminals spider-man does capture with the man who did kill peters uncle. After a while he just stops doing this, with no reason! And there is still about an hour left, so what are we going to do now? How about introduce that main villain you've been promising us? The Lizard is horribly written in every scene he's in. Why does he go to so much trouble to knock cars off of a bridge just to tell one guy (who is never seen afterwords) that their vaccine isn't ready yet? Because we needed another action scene. After that they bring up that the daily bugle wants pictures of the lizard, a point that doesn't amount to anything, except the lizard finding out who spider-man is. For someone as smart as Peter Parker has been set up to be it was really stupid for him to put his name on the camera he was using to take pictures of the lizard.The climax doesn't work for 2 reasons. The first being this is the same climax we've seen in about four other superhero movies. The second one being there are no stakes. Only half of Manhattan would be infected 8 minutes after the lizard started his chemical missile, decreasing the people at risk greatly. Also THERE'S A CURE FOR THIS!! You know, the thing Gwen has been working on for the past 6 minutes? Whoever gets infected can just get the cure shot into them afterwords, and as of right now there are only 10 people infected, so why waster your time trying to put the cure into the missile that will stretch half of Manhattan and only effect 10 people?!Gwen Stacy's dad dies and tells Peter to leave Gwen out of this, and proceeds to still date Gwen. What a great way to respect someone who died protecting people! Don't watch this movie, don't waste your time with this movie, even Spiderman 3 was better than this, so just watch the Sam Raimi trilogy, at least those movies had effort put into them.",2,even Spiderman 3 was better than this,1398470400,"04 26, 2014",2014,3299,"['***', 'review', 'may', 'contain', 'spoilers', '***No', 'one', 'involved', 'movie', 'cared', 'making', 'good', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'Spiderman', 'movies', 'will', 'make', 'money', 'matter', 'good', 'bad', 'are', ""n't"", 'mean', 'should', 'not', 'try', 'Why', 'did', 'movie', 'get', 'made', 'Simple', 'Sam', 'Raimi', 'was', ""n't"", 'given', 'enough', 'time', 'make', 'fourth', 'spider-man', 'film', 'quit', 'fans', 'wanted', 'see', 'lizard', 'screen', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'made', 'other', 'reason.First', 'Peter', 'Parker', ""n't"", 'have', 'goal', 'movie', 'first', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'happened', 'parents', ""n't"", 'explained', 'movie', 'hour', 'now', 'control', 'new', 'powers', 'scenes', 'do', ""n't"", 'help', 'audience', 'original', 'spider-man', 'Peter', 'learned', 'powers', 'controlled', 'environment', 'did', ""n't"", 'beat', 'up', 'innocent', 'people', 'subway', 'train', 'nice', 'know', 'one', 'train', 'reported', 'man', 'beat', 'up', 'five', 'people', 'climbing', 'walls', 'Peter', 'learning', 'powers', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'entire', 'focus', 'movie', 'kill', 'Uncle', 'Ben', 'time', ""n't"", 'work', 'because', 'only', 'reason', 'Peter', 'let', 'criminal', 'get', 'away', 'was', 'Peter', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'chocolate', 'milk', 'get', 'so', 'upset', 'could', ""n't"", 'afford', 'chocolate', 'milk', 'would', 'let', 'robber', 'get', 'away', 'stores', 'money', 'contrivance', 'way', 'So', 'about', 'ten', 'minutes', 'Peters', 'new', 'goal', 'bring', 'uncle', 'Ben', 'murderer', 'justice', 'let', 'police', 'ca', ""n't"", 'link', 'look', 'alike', 'criminals', 'spider-man', 'capture', 'man', 'who', 'did', 'kill', 'peters', 'uncle', 'while', 'just', 'doing', 'reason', 'still', 'hour', 'left', 'what', 'are', 'going', 'do', 'now', 'How', 'introduce', 'main', 'villain', ""'ve"", 'been', 'promising', 'Lizard', 'horribly', 'written', 'scene', 'Why', 'go', 'so', 'much', 'trouble', 'knock', 'cars', 'bridge', 'just', 'tell', 'one', 'guy', 'who', 'never', 'seen', 'afterwords', 'vaccine', ""n't"", 'ready', 'yet', 'needed', 'action', 'scene', 'bring', 'up', 'daily', 'bugle', 'pictures', 'lizard', 'point', ""n't"", 'amount', 'anything', 'lizard', 'finding', 'out', 'who', 'spider-man', 'someone', 'as', 'smart', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'been', 'set', 'up', 'be', 'was', 'really', 'stupid', 'put', 'name', 'camera', 'was', 'using', 'take', 'pictures', 'lizard.The', 'climax', ""n't"", 'work', '2', 'reasons', 'first', 'being', 'same', 'climax', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'about', 'four', 'other', 'superhero', 'movies', 'second', 'one', 'being', 'are', 'stakes', 'Only', 'half', 'Manhattan', 'would', 'be', 'infected', '8', 'minutes', 'lizard', 'started', 'chemical', 'missile', 'decreasing', 'people', 'risk', 'greatly', 'Also', 'THERE', 'CURE', 'FOR', 'THIS', 'know', 'thing', 'Gwen', 'been', 'working', 'past', '6', 'minutes', 'Whoever', 'infected', 'can', 'just', 'get', 'cure', 'shot', 'afterwords', 'right', 'now', 'are', 'only', '10', 'people', 'infected', 'so', 'why', 'waster', 'time', 'trying', 'put', 'cure', 'missile', 'will', 'stretch', 'half', 'Manhattan', 'only', 'effect', '10', 'people', 'Gwen', 'Stacy', 'dad', 'dies', 'tells', 'Peter', 'leave', 'Gwen', 'proceeds', 'still', 'date', 'Gwen', 'What', 'great', 'way', 'respect', 'someone', 'who', 'died', 'protecting', 'people', 'Do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'waste', 'time', 'movie', 'even', 'Spiderman', '3', 'was', 'better', 'so', 'just', 'watch', 'Sam', 'Raimi', 'trilogy', 'least', 'movies', 'had', 'effort', 'put']",The Amazing Spider-Man

I think they pulled it off very well. Andrew Garfield added a bit of teen angst to the role of Peter Parker that was missing from Tobey Maguire.

1418144,A29BQ6B90Y1R5F,B004LWZWFQ,S. Rhodes,"[0, 0]","After Sam Raimi released Spider-Man 3 to some incredibly lukewarm reception, Columbia Pictures and Sony decided to go back and reboot the series.  In taking a lesson from Warner Bros., Columbia Pictures found a relatively unknown indie director and opted to tell much darker and grittier story.  What Columbia Pictures seemed to miss about Batman Begins, however, is that it took more than that to make Batman Begins work.  The Amazing Spider-Man can pretty much be lobbed into the category of movies that had a lot of potential but just didn't live up to it.  That being said, there's a lot to like about The Amazing Spider-Man.  A great deal, in fact.  On the other hand, when you really get down deep, the film is just not that Amazing in the long run.The advertising for this movie claims its the untold story.  And in some ways you might say so.  Peter's parents in this one were into some great experiments and they mysteriously go missing after dropping him off with Uncle Ben and Aunt May.  Years later, the disappearance is still a mystery and Peter is now a young high school student who has a crush on a girl named Gwen Stacey, and is totally interested in science.  When touring Oscorp (a tour by which he sneaks into) he is bitten by a radio active spider.  He also meets Doctor Conners, a man who is interested in gene splicing in hopes that he may one day be able to regrow his arm.  Unfortunately, his experiments go a little too far when he becomes a hulking lizard man.  And just his luck, a guy named Mr. Ratha has decided to stop funding him because he can't seem to find a cure for whatever ails Mr. Osbourne.  Parker has his own problems, of course.  Like a giant lizard terrorizing New York.The Amazing Spider-Man has a great ensemble cast that is filled to the brim with a lot of likeable people.  And they all give it their all and it's pretty convincing stuff to some degree.  Likewise, the special effects, the fight scenes and the visuals are certainly eye-popping.  If anything The Amazing Spider-Man is fun from the standpoint that so much of the action will keep you entertained for the duration.  Not to mention there are some funny moments as well.That being said, there's also a lot to nitpick at for those who are actually paying close attention to the story.  The movie is easy on the eyes with loads of action sequences, but a lot of the actual story feels very disjointed.  The problem with the action is that it feels disconnected from the rest of the story in a lot of ways.  And The Amazing Spider-Man seems to feel content at leaving plot threads hanging or just all out ignoring them.  It's not that the film doesn't provide closure on them, it's that they don't even bother to offer up ambiguity either.The first is perhaps the simplest one.  Uncle Ben.  When it comes to Spider-Man one of the things that is really important is the Uncle Ben stuff.  The fact that the line, ""With great power comes great responsibility,"" is no where to be found is a little jarring.  But more than that it's how Uncle Ben is handled from just a simple character standpoint.  This is pretty much the reason Parker decides to fight crime in the first place.  To use his abilities with some responsibility.  Here that's pretty much thrown out the window.  Ben isn't killed because Parker was irresponsible with his abilities but rather because of Teen Angst.  That being it happens because he's being rebellious and not necessarily because he was sneaking off using his new found abilities for personal gain.  But it's not exactly that which is strange, it's more the idea that after a while the Uncle Ben plot just sort of stops.  Parker sets out to find his Uncle's killer, but then for no real reason he just stops looking.  The film doesn't really give much reason why.  And while we're sort of given this idea that the search continues, it's mostly just the fact that it's a plot thread that goes no where and is pretty much forgotten.  If there's one plot point you probably don't want to just gloss over in a Spider-Man origin story, it's definitely Uncle Ben and ""With Great Power Comes Great Responsibility.""The second plot point that pretty much gets ignored is the Mr. Rafta thing.  When the Lizard first comes around and puts the guy in danger, Spidey comes in to save him... and then the movie just leaves this plot thread dangling (literally).  This is the guy who has shut Dr. Conners down.  When Conners becomes the lizard and goes after this man it's another plot point that pretty much stops.  The difference is that this one didn't seem like it was going very far in the first place.  But it's still a little odd that the movie clearly wants you to see this as something big.Another plot thread that stops midway through is the whole mystery surrounding Parker's parents.  Granted it's quite clear this isn't over yet (as there will be a sequel and they'll probably add more to the mystery there) but again, the movie glosses over it like it's nothing big and just sort of forgets about it and moves on.  You don't see Parker expressing too much interest in what happens to his parents or anything like that either.  He finds something out about his father, but it never brings about question to Parker himself as to what exactly happened to his father.  The fact that the movie plays this up but it doesn't really do enough to show us that even Peter Parker is that interested.  And if the main character isn't that interested... do we the audience really have reason to be interested?Which brings us to another thing that's really hard to look past.  The characters.  This isn't something that can really be blamed on the actors themselves, but more the writers.  The first and most painfully obvious is the Lizard Man.  Mostly because his motivations are paperthin.  It never becomes too clear as to why he actually wants to succeed in his ordeal at all.  More than that, it's also pretty sad because the movie does a little too much to bring about convenience for our hero and villain in this regard.  The only reason Peter as Spider-Man is able to find out what he's up to is because he happens across it on a computer that Conners as The Lizardman just so happens to leave open.  Not through any of his intelligence and skill, but rather because of convenient dumb luck in the plot.  Likewise, our villain only finds out that Peter Parker is Spider-Man because he just so conveniently left his camera in the bad guys hideout with a property of sticker on it.  There's no real dramatic tension through any this.  Remember in Raimi's Spider-Man the tension that was in that particular scene when it's clear that Harry Osbourne's father knows who Spider-Man is and happens to be sitting at the same table?  Parker isn't aware of this yet... but the audience is and we're sort of wondering how this will play out.  And it happens because Osbourne sees a cut on Parker... that he gave him.  This is what gives Parker away.  Not the villain conveniently seeing a piece of property labeled.  And that's just sort of takes away the tension in many respects.That's not to say that the movie is saved by the main character.  And this may be where The Amazing Spider-Man is hardest hit.  One of the things that Sam Raimi's Spider-Man 2 really helped establish is that there is a difference between the Peter Parker persona and the Spider-Man persona.  Peter Parker by himself is nothing more than a geeky, awkward teenager who manages to attract a few bullies and whatnot because of it.  That's generally how we've seen Parker in the past.  And I'm not really saying this in comparison to Raimi's film so much as it is that part of what makes the main character in most Super Hero movies stand out is that they ARE usually outcasts in some way, shape or form.  Here, Peter Parker doesn't have that.  Except for being awkward around ONE girl (Gwen Stacey) he is often not really that awkward or having a difficult time fitting in around school.  Sure he gets picked on by Flash, but Parker is already standing up to Flash before he gets his powers.  And once he gets them he sort of just uses them to be a jerk to Flash.  And while that much I'm okay with (however big a waste of time it is to see) it is the idea that once Parker gets his powers he never actually grows as a character by the end of the film.  And that's kind of a disappointing.  This mostly comes from the fact that Parker is kind of boring to begin with.  He's not exactly all that awkward.  He begins the film as a wise-cracking kind of guy.  He's not doing THAT behind a mask anymore.  There doesn't feel like much of a difference between the two personas anymore.  And while that's not quite as big to me, it does make him less interesting of a character.This may also be why the love story feels a little odd as well.  Gwen Stacey is interested in Parker from the beginning.  There's not much in trying to win Gwen Stacey over here.  It's mostly just her being somewhat interested and then eventually becoming fully interested.  It's not as though Parker just ""isn't being noticed,"" by a girl he likes or anything like that.  They don't even grow on one another.  It just so happens that at one point you just accept that they like each other and that they should fall in love... because that's what the trope dictates.  But they don't naturally progress to that point as characters.  And in some movies this can be kind of charming, but in The Amazing Spider-Man it only serves to pass up another moment in which the writers could've made Parker grow as a character.  Or, if anything, to sort of reiterate that with great power comes great responsibility.  But nothing of the sort happens here.  Peter Parker is the same character at the end of the movie that he was at the beginning.  The point is simple: Peter Parker lacks depth.  And it just doesn't make him as interesting of a character.There are a few other small gripes as well.  Perhaps the only other one worth mentioning is that the film's tone seems to clash at times.  There are funny moments in The Amazing Spider-Man but other times you feel like it's trying to be way too serious.  The movie will crack a joke and then it almost seems to clear its throat as if to say, ""But there's no time for joking; we're trying to be serious here!""  You almost get the sense they're trying really hard to make their reboot as glorifying as Batman Begins was in 2005.  But again, I'm not sure they understand that Batman Begins also had a pretty good story that had a main character who, above everything, actually grows.  Batman Begins also didn't leave quite as many dangling plot threads.  The movie wants to be taken seriously and be seen as ""darker"" while it also seems to try and be as goofy as the 2002 film was back in the day.  It's got some funny moments, but the movie tries to move on from them pretty quickly so that it can get back to be serious.  It's like that guy in the meeting who is trying to hold back a laugh at times.All this seems to encompass a movie that simply doesn't have that much focus.  It's certainly a lot of fun to watch the action moments, but each time when you're reminded that it's supposed to have a story it's hard to ignore the dangling plot threads and the fact that the main character never really grows... in a genre where you expect the main character to grow.  You might have some fun, but just the same here's to hoping the sequel isn't afraid to reach a little higher.",3,There's Great Power Here...

1418149,A3VQSFORKH8B7O,B004LWZWFQ,Steven Hancock,"[11, 21]","I'll be honest, I was not a big fan of the original trilogy. The first film was good, but lacked a good, strong story. The second one delved too much into the emotional angst, and this one proved why Tobey Maguire, a good actor, was miscast as Peter Parker. The third one, which could have moved past the emotional angst to tell a truly heroic tale, delved even further into emotional angst, and was without a doubt the worst superhero flick ever. So, even though the idea of a reboot of the franchise was questionable, the filmmakers here have gone back to the origin story, but have also crafted a strong, character-driven story that has some of the emotional complexities of Spider-man, but is also fun, exciting, and downright funny at times as well.Andrew Garfield proves himself every bit superior to Tobey Maquire as Peter Parker. His character is marred by tragedy, and he does have a hint of the tragic figure to him, but he also brings a good amount of strength and humor to the role, making his take on the character the definitive film version of Spidey. A strong supporting cast, including Martin Sheen and Sally Field as Uncle Ben and Aunt May, deliver solid, believable performances as well. Rhys Ifans proves to be a strong villain, and Emma Stone is both beautiful and talented as Gwen Stacy, Parker's love interest.The action and visual effects are brilliant. The story does come off as predictable from time to time, but the terrific performances and action scenes make up for some of the weaker points in the story. This is, without a doubt, the best Spider-man film so far, and bodes well for the future of the franchise.

1418156,APPG3AAIJLF1,B004LWZWFQ,Stokie Dave,"[1, 4]","I've been a mild fan of Spider-man since the 1970s.  That was when I read the British reprints of the classic 1963-67 Marvel originals.  The Lizard, Doc Octopus, the Kingpin, even The Living Brain all thrilled me when I was a kid.  This movie is a well-made and impeccably acted tribute to those originals, updated to a contemporary setting.  The dialogue, costuming, lighting, FX, sound are all fine.  The music knows its place in the movie, and it generally works well.  The one thing that did annoy me was... the main villain here just doesn't look right.  Ditko's original 1960s comic-book version of him is so memorable. Yet it's not as if the film-makers changed the villain to make him more scary.  Because he isn't that scary.  He's an unconvincing cobbled-together blend of the Hulk, Dragon-man from the Kirby's Fantastic Four, Gozilla, and a guy in a rubber suit.  As a super-villain his visual style simply lacks the all-important Marvel sense of _style_.  But I wonder if that change was deliberate?  The movie probably works really really well for the 12 year-old who is 'new to the whole Spider-man thing'.  If those people are the intended audience, then the film-makers probably didn't want to make the villain too scary - because that would risk all those over-protective moms freaking out and renting _Beverly Hills Chihuahua 3_ instead.  Apart from that fairly heavy central flaw (the other is that Spider-man does Web searches using Bing, and yet is supposed to be intelligent) the first two-thirds of the movie are interesting and generally great fun.  Even the 'luv interest' sections are watchable, mainly for the comedic teenage awkwardness.  But towards the end the movie gets very choppy, and the audience heads into the most predictable of formula finishes. But overall... _Amazing Spider-man_ is nicely made and worth seeing, and is certainly vastly more entertaining than the first reboot.",3,"Entertaining reboot, but the villain lacks visual style",1350777600,"10 21, 2012",2012,1918,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'mild', 'fan', 'Spider-man', '1970s', 'was', 'when', 'read', 'British', 'reprints', 'classic', '1963-67', 'Marvel', 'originals', 'Lizard', 'Doc', 'Octopus', 'Kingpin', 'even', 'Living', 'Brain', 'thrilled', 'when', 'was', 'kid', 'movie', 'well-made', 'impeccably', 'acted', 'tribute', 'originals', 'updated', 'contemporary', 'setting', 'dialogue', 'costuming', 'lighting', 'FX', 'sound', 'are', 'fine', 'music', 'place', 'movie', 'generally', 'well', 'one', 'thing', 'did', 'annoy', 'was', 'main', 'villain', 'here', 'just', ""n't"", 'look', 'right', 'Ditko', 'original', '1960s', 'comic-book', 'version', 'so', 'memorable', 'not', 'film-makers', 'changed', 'villain', 'make', 'more', 'scary', ""n't"", 'scary', 'unconvincing', 'cobbled-together', 'blend', 'Hulk', 'Dragon-man', 'Kirby', 'Fantastic', 'Four', 'Gozilla', 'guy', 'rubber', 'suit', 'super-villain', 'visual', 'style', 'simply', 'all-important', 'Marvel', 'sense', '_style_', 'wonder', 'change', 'was', 'deliberate', 'movie', 'probably', 'really', 'really', 'well', '12', 'year-old', 'who', ""'new"", 'whole', 'Spider-man', 'thing', 'people', 'are', 'intended', 'audience', 'then', 'film-makers', 'probably', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'make', 'villain', 'too', 'scary', 'would', 'risk', 'over-protective', 'moms', 'freaking', 'out', 'renting', '_Beverly', 'Hills', 'Chihuahua', '3_', 'instead', 'Apart', 'fairly', 'heavy', 'central', 'flaw', 'other', 'Spider-man', 'Web', 'searches', 'using', 'Bing', 'yet', 'supposed', 'be', 'intelligent', 'first', 'two-thirds', 'movie', 'are', 'interesting', 'generally', 'great', 'fun', 'Even', ""'luv"", 'interest', 'sections', 'are', 'watchable', 'mainly', 'comedic', 'teenage', 'awkwardness', 'end', 'movie', 'very', 'choppy', 'audience', 'heads', 'most', 'predictable', 'formula', 'finishes', 'overall', '_Amazing', 'Spider-man_', 'nicely', 'made', 'worth', 'seeing', 'certainly', 'vastly', 'more', 'entertaining', 'first', 'reboot']",The Amazing Spider-Man
1418157,A26MJME9IBNETY,B004LWZWFQ,StrangePegs,"[3, 4]","It's a good movie, and I loved (finally!) seeing The Lizard onscreen. I've been waiting for him to show up for, well, years, especially since Connors has been bouncing around in the background of the other Spider-Man films. However, it should have been Spider-Man 4, not a re-boot. In starting over, they failed to recapture the essence of what is Spider-Man, instead giving us some new version that gets (most of) the facts straight but doesn't give us the heart and soul that Raimi did. In short, they gave us a good movie but a poor adaptation.I walked out of the theater from a good movie completely unsatisfied.I hear people saying that this new one is better than the other one, but I don't think I believe that even just measuring them movie for movie. Sure, the special effects are slicker in this one. The movie is flashier. The Lizard looks great. But, beyond that, the movie is just formula. I think people are tricked into believing this one is better because it's darker and prettier, so to speak. But the characters, with the exception, maybe, of Gwen are less developed, so it's a story that's hard to get involved with.I didn't care when Ben died because we don't really see Peter care. We know, intellectually, that he cares, but we never feel it. And the way that he died felt pretty contrived. The whole movie is like that. We know how we're supposed to feel about various things, because we know the Spider-Man mythos. The producers or the director or writer or some combination of them know we know these things, and they rely on our pre-knowledge to give us access to the feelings that the movie ought to be evoking so that they can actually gloss over all of that stuff. In truth, I feel sort of gypped.Perhaps the movie's biggest failure, however, is the reduction of Peter's motivation to being Spider-Man to one of revenge (or &#34;getting even&#34; as Uncle Ben says) and guilt. This is the same thing that Nolan did with Batman in Batman Begins. It's as if there can be no other motivation for a super hero. This is where the heart of Spider-Man is lost in this new movie. Spider-Man is not about revenge. It's all about &#34;with great power comes great responsibility,&#34; and it's the absence of this one line from the movie that may be it's most egregious error.The reason for the success of the comic book was that it asked the question of what a normal kid would do if he got super powers and answered it in a realistic way. Peter's first motivation was to use his new power for fame and fortune. The introduction of tragedy into his life becomes not a motivation for revenge but a reason to look at himself, see where he failed, and become a better person. Spider-Man becomes a character that is motivated to do good because it is the right thing to do not because he's seeking revenge against criminals or wallowing in guilt. Sure, those things come up, but they are not the motivating factor. [Later, Marvel would decide to give us a character motivated by revenge, so they gave us the Punisher.]The new Webb movie (I know, ha ha, right?) reduces all of the complicated emotional trauma of being a teenager into one driving emotion, getting revenge against the people that have done Peter Parker wrong. Starting with Flash and moving through his vendetta against long-haired, blond criminals. He morphs that with guilt over the fact that Peter feels like he created The Lizard, and that whole thing about the heroes creating their villains is also something I'm rather tired of seeing used; it gave me flashbacks to Burton's Batman, &#34;You made me!&#34; So, yeah, I came away unimpressed.Which is not to say, again, that it's not a good movie. It's totally enjoyable and exciting. The Lizard looks awesome and the CG work is excellent. They use a number of iconic Spider-Man poses in the movie, which was nice to see. Denis Leary and Emma Stone are both great. Sally Field was out of place, although Martin Sheen was pretty good. There was nothing to distinguish Andrew Garfield other than his build, though. He did an adequate job, but he didn't really pull off the nerdy, awkward teenager thing. If you like exciting super hero movies, it's certainly worth seeing in the theater.But it's not my Spider-Man movie. Sam Raimi made that one 10 years ago, and Sony would have done better to just carry on with the new cast and director building off of what Raimi started rather than trying to start over.",4,Not My Spider-Man Movie,1399161600,"05 4, 2014",2014,4441,"['good', 'movie', 'loved', 'finally', 'seeing', 'Lizard', 'onscreen', ""'ve"", 'been', 'waiting', 'show', 'up', 'well', 'years', 'especially', 'Connors', 'been', 'bouncing', 'around', 'background', 'other', 'Spider-Man', 'films', 'However', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'Spider-Man', '4', 'not', 're-boot', 'starting', 'over', 'failed', 'recapture', 'essence', 'what', 'Spider-Man', 'instead', 'giving', 'new', 'version', 'most', 'facts', 'straight', ""n't"", 'give', 'heart', 'soul', 'Raimi', 'did', 'short', 'gave', 'good', 'movie', 'poor', 'adaptation.I', 'walked', 'theater', 'good', 'movie', 'completely', 'unsatisfied.I', 'hear', 'people', 'saying', 'new', 'one', 'better', 'other', 'one', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'believe', 'even', 'just', 'measuring', 'movie', 'movie', 'Sure', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'slicker', 'one', 'movie', 'flashier', 'Lizard', 'great', 'movie', 'just', 'formula', 'think', 'people', 'are', 'tricked', 'believing', 'one', 'better', 'darker', 'prettier', 'so', 'speak', 'characters', 'exception', 'maybe', 'Gwen', 'are', 'less', 'developed', 'story', 'hard', 'get', 'involved', 'with.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'when', 'Ben', 'died', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'see', 'Peter', 'care', 'know', 'intellectually', 'never', 'feel', 'way', 'died', 'felt', 'pretty', 'contrived', 'whole', 'movie', 'know', 'how', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'feel', 'about', 'various', 'things', 'know', 'Spider-Man', 'mythos', 'producers', 'director', 'writer', 'combination', 'know', 'know', 'things', 'rely', 'pre-knowledge', 'give', 'access', 'feelings', 'movie', 'ought', 'be', 'evoking', 'can', 'actually', 'gloss', 'stuff', 'truth', 'feel', 'sort', 'gypped.Perhaps', 'movie', 'biggest', 'failure', 'however', 'reduction', 'Peter', 'motivation', 'being', 'Spider-Man', 'one', 'revenge', '34', 'getting', 'even', '34', 'Uncle', 'Ben', 'guilt', 'same', 'thing', 'Nolan', 'did', 'Batman', 'Batman', 'Begins', 'can', 'be', 'other', 'motivation', 'super', 'hero', 'where', 'heart', 'Spider-Man', 'lost', 'new', 'movie', 'Spider-Man', 'not', 'revenge', '34', 'great', 'power', 'great', 'responsibility', '34', 'absence', 'one', 'line', 'movie', 'may', 'be', 'most', 'egregious', 'error.The', 'reason', 'success', 'comic', 'book', 'was', 'asked', 'question', 'what', 'normal', 'kid', 'would', 'do', 'got', 'super', 'powers', 'answered', 'realistic', 'way', 'Peter', 'first', 'motivation', 'was', 'use', 'new', 'power', 'fame', 'fortune', 'introduction', 'tragedy', 'life', 'not', 'motivation', 'revenge', 'reason', 'look', 'see', 'where', 'failed', 'become', 'better', 'person', 'Spider-Man', 'character', 'motivated', 'do', 'good', 'right', 'thing', 'do', 'not', 'seeking', 'revenge', 'criminals', 'wallowing', 'guilt', 'Sure', 'things', 'come', 'up', 'are', 'not', 'motivating', 'factor', '[', 'Later', 'Marvel', 'would', 'decide', 'give', 'character', 'motivated', 'revenge', 'gave', 'Punisher', ']', 'new', 'Webb', 'movie', 'know', 'ha', 'ha', 'right', 'complicated', 'emotional', 'trauma', 'being', 'teenager', 'one', 'driving', 'emotion', 'getting', 'revenge', 'people', 'have', 'done', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'wrong', 'Starting', 'Flash', 'moving', 'vendetta', 'long-haired', 'blond', 'criminals', 'morphs', 'guilt', 'fact', 'Peter', 'feels', 'created', 'Lizard', 'whole', 'thing', 'heroes', 'creating', 'villains', 'also', 'something', ""'m"", 'rather', 'tired', 'seeing', 'used', 'gave', 'Burton', 'Batman', '34', 'made', '34', 'So', 'yeah', 'came', 'away', 'unimpressed.Which', 'not', 'say', 'again', 'not', 'good', 'movie', 'totally', 'enjoyable', 'exciting', 'Lizard', 'awesome', 'CG', 'work', 'excellent', 'use', 'number', 'iconic', 'Spider-Man', 'poses', 'movie', 'was', 'nice', 'see', 'Denis', 'Leary', 'Emma', 'Stone', 'are', 'great', 'Sally', 'Field', 'was', 'place', 'Martin', 'Sheen', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'was', 'nothing', 'distinguish', 'Andrew', 'Garfield', 'other', 'build', 'though', 'did', 'adequate', 'job', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'pull', 'off', 'nerdy', 'awkward', 'teenager', 'thing', 'like', 'exciting', 'super', 'hero', 'movies', 'certainly', 'worth', 'seeing', 'theater.But', 'not', 'Spider-Man', 'movie', 'Sam', 'Raimi', 'made', 'one', '10', 'years', 'ago', 'Sony', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'better', 'just', 'carry', 'new', 'cast', 'director', 'building', 'what', 'Raimi', 'started', 'rather', 'trying', 'start', 'over']",The Amazing Spider-Man

Okay, so Tobet Maguire wasn't the most awesome Spider-man (it now seems like James Franco would have made a better bet, the way things have turned out... but at least he's not become as typecast as Maguire now is and lives to act again). This one tries different things - it doesn't make a big deal about Peter Parker being an outcast and a science geek, it just makes him a social outcast (the science geek is only hinted at). What it does differently is to allude to some story about Peter's parents, which was ignored for the first 40 years of Spider-man's history. It rushes right into ""someone close to Peter is told his secret identity"", again something that didn't happen ever. So it breaks a lot of taboos right off the bat. It also tells simple stories: Peter chases the Lizard, because it's some sort of game... he fights him, nearly dies, others do, no one is sure why... And why does the Lizard crave universal lizard-ness? We're never really convinced.The plot is awful. Andrew Garfield is a bit too twitchy to be Peter Parker, his head too small, his lips too bloody, his teeth too grey... ditto for Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy. Bad things will happen. And yet, the story is pleasant, perhaps due to the CG, which really works! I liked it, probably for the first time ever.The screenplay, for all of its limitations, also does its best to make the sequel self-evident - we need to meet Norman Osborn, we need to find out what happens to Uncle Ben's killer (does he, I don't know, become the possessor of the Cosmic Cube, or the recipient of the alien Spider-man suit/Venom/Carnage thingy?).We need to, I suppose, watch Gwen Stacy get thrown off the Brooklyn Bridge. And maybe we need to also meet another Mary Jane Watson.Let's see what happens.

He made a mess of a movie to cling unto the rights of that series. Dropped a few pennies or bucks, released it insanely briefly in ONE theater for a week (maybe less) that gave him the right for just a few more years. He finally gave up and sony grabbed it all up and must produce a movie in the next 1 or two years or it will lose the rights too. I have NO doubt this isn't gonna happen, because the mouse is Big and has dropped BILLIONS into ownership of marvel, so they'll pump out junk just to keep it.+Final though: the mouse's claws into pixar will be felt in the next two of three years when ALL movies made before it bought them has passed by.

For those who actually think that Andrew Garfield is a better Peter Parker than Toby McGuire, you better reread the original spiderman comic series; not the modern revamped photoshopped version, but the original Stan Lee/ Steve Ditko version! Peter Parker is a simple, innocent, nerdy, boring teenager trying to fit it, with his only vice is being one very smart bookworm. He's a bit of a Mama's boy. He isn't cute, nervous and quirky jerky like Garfield and doesn't ride a cool skateboard, nor does he flirt with the ladies with ease. Everything he does is a struggle, and just when he thinks things are going his way for once, shit happens. Garfield's version is the antithesis of what Peter Parker should be. On the other hand, Tobey's version, although not perfect, best captures the spirit of Peter Parker, who is wide eyed, innocent, smart and empathetic. There is more feeling, emotion and empathy in the opening school bus scene in spider man 1 than in the entire amazing spiderman movie. Overall, the new Spiderman movie is so disjointed and poorly written that you might as well string a bunch of YouTube clips and call that a movie. The director was obviously aiming for the Twilight crowd, as he created a cool, emo Peter Parker that is just frumpy and too cocky for his own good. Lots of plot holes and implausibilities that would give Prometheus a run for its money. In the day and age of modern prosthetics, why would the Lizard labor over regrowing a new arm? The direction by Marc Webb is simply piss poor; does he suffer from ADD, as the movie is choppy and uneven all throughout? Webb has no sense of sound sequential pacing and it shows. The scene showing how Peter Parker actually transformed into Spiderman is laughably bad and lacks even the smallest iota of plausibility. Sorry, Sally Field is not Aunt May and why did they get Martin Sheen as uncle Ben? Both were pedestrian at best. Worst of all, the business with Peter Parker's parents was as bad as Qui Gon explaining the force in midichlorian terms.

I also thought Marc Webb could of made Dr. Connors a more powerful foe than he was in this film also I couldnt understand in this spiderman movie how come spiderman had his mask off and it seem that he needed help. I'm getting alittle tired of puting dirt on this fantastic film now my favorite part is the soundtrack just amazing in my opinion along with romance to the battle scenes and Andrew Garefield put alot of justice into spider-man like with his unique poses and just his acting overall was just outstanding as the iconic web-slinger lisen all I got to say rent or buy it cause it's one the most entertaining film of this year for sure.",5,Spidey is going to take you on a epic journey.,1353801600,"11 25, 2012",2012,1501,"['movie', 'probably', 'one', 'most', 'epic', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'saw', 'year', 'are', 'minor', 'flaws', 'new', 'look', 'Spidey', 'really', 'grown', 'many', 'people', 'complained', 'new', 'look', 'didnt', 'lenses', 'was', 'most', 'awesome', 'part', 'read', 'comics', 'yes', 'movie', 'stayed', 'loyal', 'comic', 'way', 'way', ""'m"", 'just', 'going', 'explain', 'flaw', 'movie', 'was', 'directed', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'actor', 'performace', 'one', 'thing', ""could'nt"", 'understand', 'why', 'Marc', 'Webb', 'decided', 'make', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'skater', 'instead', 'nerdy', 'kid', 'not', 'skater', 'now', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'wasnt', 'interesting', 'would', 'perfer', 'see', 'peter', 'comics', 'Uncle', 'Ben', 'memorable', 'quote', 'Great', 'Power', 'Comes', 'Great', 'Responabilites', 'said', 'same', 'thing', 'different', 'way', 'bugged', 'also', 'thought', 'Marc', 'Webb', 'could', 'made', 'Dr.', 'Connors', 'more', 'powerful', 'foe', 'was', 'film', 'also', 'couldnt', 'understand', 'spiderman', 'movie', 'how', 'come', 'spiderman', 'had', 'mask', 'seem', 'needed', 'help', ""'m"", 'getting', 'alittle', 'tired', 'puting', 'dirt', 'fantastic', 'film', 'now', 'favorite', 'part', 'soundtrack', 'just', 'amazing', 'opinion', 'romance', 'battle', 'scenes', 'Andrew', 'Garefield', 'put', 'alot', 'justice', 'spider-man', 'unique', 'poses', 'just', 'acting', 'overall', 'was', 'just', 'outstanding', 'iconic', 'web-slinger', 'got', 'say', 'rent', 'buy', 'cause', 'one', 'most', 'entertaining', 'film', 'year', 'sure']",The Amazing Spider-Man

Sally Field is also great in the dramatic role of the concerned mother of Peter Parker.One criticism I had were the special effects / cinematography could have been improved.

1418194,A1QRXEM0WSLGT5,B004LWZWFQ,The Man With No Name,"[5, 11]","I have just watched 'The Amazing Spiderman' at the movie theater today and while it's still fresh in my mind I'll knock out this review.  I won't waste time explaining the premise and happenings of the film, that's already on Wikipedia AND Amazon. But I will give my personal opinions/feelings of the film.**Caution, some spoilers ahead**Is this better or worse that the Tobey Mcguire incarnation?  Well, overall it's better.  Andrew Garfield looks like the character more, has a better voice for the role and does A LOT of his own stunts.While it improves on the film franchise, this incarnation also lacks.  As Mark Eremite in his review on Amazon stated: the Uncle Ben death is messed up.  By now you probably know the story of how Peter could have stopped a robber but didn't and later on the robber kills Uncle Ben, probably for his car or money.  This guilt of inaction leads Peter to start giving of himself constantly as Spiderman.  This movie sort of screws that up premise though.  I personally thought that the previous Uncle Ben in the Mcguire 'Spiderman' movies did a stellar job.  Martin Sheen however does not.  Aside from not being the warm affectionate Uncle Ben we the fans are all familier with, he screws up BIG on the death scene.Don't get me wrong, when you see Peter listening to the last voicemail that Uncle Ben leaves him before dying you will feel sadness, Sheen is a decent actor, no doubt about that.  I just don't think he was right for this role.  I kept getting the feeling that he was just there to add STAR POWER to the film, nothing more.  Anyway...back to the death scene.  As the robber is running he runs into someone and falls and his gun slids out onto the ground.  Okay if I was there and saw that, I would just step back against the building and provide a clear path for the villian.  He would no doubt pick up his gun and run past me, leaving me ALIVE for leaving him alone.  The Uncle Ben in this film does not do this, he sees the gun and runs for it.  The robber and Ben get to the gun at the same time and begin to wrestle for it.  The gun goes off and Ben dies.  This pivotal death scene/event is kind of cheapened.  The death scene in Tobey's movie is much better and lays a blanket of guilt on Spiderman that will drive him for the rest of his life.FYI, to all you readers of this review, I know the death scene is the product of the writers and not Sheen's fault.  He was just doing the part they laid out for him.  Anyway...Also it's kind of comical seeing Emma Stone and Andrew Garfield playing 17 yr old high school students.  Emma Stone is 23 and does not look like she belongs in high school.  Although I will retract and say that Garfield, despite being 28, does do a pretty good job.  He kind of goes for an Emo-Peter Parker in this film, dark and quiet.Despite the flaws, the film does shine in the special effects department.  The Lizard looks fantastic and the scenes where you are watching the movie from Spidey's p.o.v., epic.  There is quite a bit of web slinging in this movie, something the Tobey Mcguire 'Spiderman 1' lacked.This film also showcases Peter's intelligence and ingenuity.  He designs his web shooters in this film, and does not simply rely on glands in his wrists.  He also designs his costume, sews it himself, screen-printed on the designs and completes the mask with lenses from his sunglasses.  Finally I know how Spiderman can cover his eyes and still see...The plot is nothing new to anyone.  Spiderman is raised by his aunt and uncle, uncle gets shot and dies, Peter Parker quits being selfish and becomes Spiderman, AND fights superpowered villians.  Is the plot fresh, NO.  Is it still fun and enjoyable to watch, ABSOLUTELY.  Plus the cast is quite good, Dennis Leary, Rhys Ifans, Sally Fields, and an appearance by the one and only C. Thomas Howell.Is this worth a watch at the theaters, YES.  Is this own-worthy?  OH YEAH!!!While this film is no where near 'The Avengers', it is number 2 for me this summer on my ratings board.IMPORTANT, watch the movie through the credits, there is another scene I have read about with Kurt Conners talking to a mysterious man in his prison cell.  I had to go to the bathroom and missed it!!!  Come on movie makers, enough with the post credits scenes, just put them in the regular movie!!!Well I've got to go, I am currently working on the 'Game of Thrones': Season 1 box set.

The film incorporates many of the original Spider-man ideas, people, and scenes, while maintaining a certain amount of originality. The plot of the film has already been compromised (40 year anniversary of first publication), so there is no need for me to dwell on it.3D holograms are used in the film, and of course Spider-man flies directly at your head. If you have the wallet and opportunity, I would suggest the 3D version.In all honesty I preferred Toby McGuire to Andrew Garfield as Spider-man. That is not to say Andrew did a bad job, he didn't. The part was written different. I am a big fan of Emma Stone (Gwen Stacy), who has been in High School going on 6 years now. She can play the hottie and the nerd both better than most actresses. But what this film didn't have was that one defining moment that will forever be played in movie pop culture history and that was ""The Kiss"" which drove women into the theater. Yes, Emma and Andrew swap spit, but it wasn't the same as that upside down, remove the mask, just rescued me moment.Denis Leary, who typically plays an angry comic, delivers in his role as Captain Stacy.

1418197,A2VUD4SPJO4V33,B004LWZWFQ,Theo,"[8, 12]","The Peter Parker we find in this film is grittier, more real than one in Sam Raimi's previous trilogy. He's kind of a spaz and he looks it. The kind of guy you could easily imagine geeking out with all his geeky friends, playing World of Warcraft between hits on a bong. Not that there's anything like that in this movie (where's Harry Osborn when you need him?), but you get the idea. It's this more ""real"" take on Peter Parker, not quite so perky and preppy as Toby McGuire's version, that's the thing I liked most about this movie.Other than that, there's not a huge amount to say. Emma Stone's Gwen Stacy is cute but utterly unremarkable, and so too for most of the other performances. Sally Field injects more than we are used to seeing into Aunt May, but that's about it. I'm not entirely sure that Martin Sheen was even trying. For long time spider fans, or even just those who've watched a handful of superhero summer blockbusters, this isn't a film with too many surprises. Or even, dare I say it, any surprises. It's an entertaining extravaganza, but it's not the kind of thing that very many people over the age of 15 will feel the need to see more than once. You may want to bear that in mind when making the decision whether to rent or buy.It is worth noting that this film is clearly designed to set up a sequel, and more than likely a trilogy. There are questions raised and themes presaged that are then just left hanging within the scope of this individual movie.The only thing I would say actively went wrong in this film was its attempt to have Spider-Man spout the kind of witty banter he uses when fighting his comic book battles. You may be able to get away with that kind of thing on the printed page. But in this medium the pace of the banter was totally out of sync with the blitzkrieg action of the fighting itself. For this reason it came across as completely forced, and to be frank, as a rather poor and awkward voice-over. Fortunately, although glaringly obvious, this flaw was rather minor and forgivable in the scope of the movie as a whole.Finally, I might as well make my own prejudices clear. I personally am quite sick of the endless reboots that plague the genre. I think things at least have the potential to get far more interesting when the universe is left running for longer periods. There is at least the chance for writers to move beyond endless recapitulation of the same basic storylines - a form of writing that once again I believe is a plague upon the genre. I know that Bruce Timm's work in the DC Animated Universe was far, far more interesting back when all the shows made up a definite continuity: a true universe with scope and depth and history and a future that the viewers and the writers got to explore together.What I personally would most love to see are productions that allow for real development and change. That don't require all the principles to be treated as such valuable pieces of intellectual property that they must be preserved forever in aspic. Or perhaps, to go with a more apt analogy, treated like action figures who must never be removed from their packaging because to do so would annihilate their value on the collectables market.A hopeless dream, I know.Theo.",4,Well Done For What It Was,1365465600,"04 9, 2013",2013,3239,"['Peter', 'Parker', 'find', 'film', 'grittier', 'more', 'real', 'one', 'Sam', 'Raimi', 'previous', 'trilogy', 'kind', 'spaz', 'kind', 'guy', 'could', 'easily', 'imagine', 'geeking', 'out', 'geeky', 'friends', 'playing', 'World', 'Warcraft', 'hits', 'bong', 'Not', 'anything', 'movie', 'where', 'Harry', 'Osborn', 'when', 'need', 'get', 'idea', 'more', 'real', 'take', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'not', 'quite', 'so', 'perky', 'preppy', 'Toby', 'McGuire', 'version', 'thing', 'liked', 'most', 'movie.Other', 'not', 'huge', 'amount', 'say', 'Emma', 'Stone', 'Gwen', 'Stacy', 'cute', 'utterly', 'unremarkable', 'so', 'too', 'most', 'other', 'performances', 'Sally', 'Field', 'more', 'are', 'used', 'seeing', 'Aunt', 'May', ""'m"", 'not', 'entirely', 'sure', 'Martin', 'Sheen', 'was', 'even', 'trying', 'long', 'time', 'spider', 'fans', 'even', 'just', 'who', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'handful', 'superhero', 'summer', 'blockbusters', ""n't"", 'film', 'too', 'many', 'surprises', 'even', 'dare', 'say', 'surprises', 'entertaining', 'extravaganza', 'not', 'kind', 'thing', 'very', 'many', 'people', 'age', '15', 'will', 'feel', 'need', 'see', 'more', 'once', 'may', 'want', 'bear', 'mind', 'when', 'making', 'decision', 'rent', 'buy.It', 'worth', 'noting', 'film', 'clearly', 'designed', 'set', 'up', 'sequel', 'more', 'likely', 'trilogy', 'are', 'questions', 'raised', 'themes', 'presaged', 'are', 'then', 'just', 'left', 'hanging', 'scope', 'individual', 'only', 'thing', 'would', 'say', 'actively', 'went', 'wrong', 'film', 'was', 'attempt', 'have', 'Spider-Man', 'kind', 'witty', 'banter', 'when', 'fighting', 'comic', 'book', 'battles', 'may', 'be', 'able', 'get', 'away', 'kind', 'thing', 'printed', 'page', 'medium', 'pace', 'banter', 'was', 'totally', 'sync', 'blitzkrieg', 'action', 'fighting', 'reason', 'came', 'completely', 'forced', 'be', 'frank', 'rather', 'poor', 'awkward', 'voice-over', 'Fortunately', 'glaringly', 'obvious', 'flaw', 'was', 'rather', 'minor', 'forgivable', 'scope', 'movie', 'whole.Finally', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'make', 'own', 'prejudices', 'clear', 'personally', 'am', 'quite', 'sick', 'endless', 'reboots', 'plague', 'genre', 'think', 'things', 'least', 'have', 'potential', 'get', 'far', 'more', 'interesting', 'when', 'universe', 'left', 'running', 'longer', 'periods', 'least', 'chance', 'writers', 'move', 'endless', 'recapitulation', 'same', 'basic', 'storylines', 'form', 'writing', 'once', 'again', 'believe', 'plague', 'genre', 'know', 'Bruce', 'Timm', 'work', 'DC', 'Animated', 'Universe', 'was', 'far', 'far', 'more', 'interesting', 'back', 'when', 'shows', 'made', 'up', 'definite', 'continuity', 'true', 'universe', 'scope', 'depth', 'history', 'future', 'viewers', 'writers', 'got', 'explore', 'personally', 'would', 'most', 'love', 'see', 'are', 'productions', 'allow', 'real', 'development', 'change', 'do', ""n't"", 'require', 'principles', 'be', 'treated', 'such', 'valuable', 'pieces', 'intellectual', 'property', 'must', 'be', 'preserved', 'forever', 'aspic', 'perhaps', 'go', 'more', 'apt', 'analogy', 'treated', 'action', 'figures', 'who', 'must', 'never', 'be', 'removed', 'packaging', 'do', 'so', 'would', 'annihilate', 'value', 'collectables', 'market.A', 'hopeless', 'dream', 'know.Theo']",The Amazing Spider-Man

I suspect that a more scientifically savvy audience appreciates an ever evolving origins story and I also enjoyed the initial dealing-with-new-superpowers interlude which was very amusing and again just seemed a much more realistic reaction from Peter Parker to his new abilities.  Exceptional performances for Peter and Gwen are what truly make this production stand out from every other action-packed big-budget flick out there, not to mention a truly scary and menacing super-villain causing some sequences to play a little like a horror film.  The tragic loss of his uncle is intensely emotional making the motivation for becoming a vigilante seem more credible, while the use of fantasy tech to supplement his powers added to this as well.  love Martin Sheen as uncle Ben, never been much of a Sally Fields fan but apparently the producers were looking for star power to offset the use of mostly unknowns in the starring roles (which I think was a stroke of brilliance by the way).The FX action sequences are seamless, gorgeous, captivating and again convincing (hitting on this alot I know but I think it's an essential factor).  It's the details that make the difference, like while on the job at dizzying heights getting a call on his cell from aunt May reminding him to pick up eggs on his way home.  The wise-cracking Spidey is not only back but actually funny with flawless comedic timing throughout and the gratuitous Stan Lee cameo was priceless.  This is a new Spider-man, a better one, one whom you will be emotionally invested in by the dramatic ending which brilliantly wraps up an all-around excellent, excellent film!  :o)",5,Fitting Reboot of a Comic Legend,1353888000,"11 26, 2012",2012,2240,"['watching', 'first', 'five', 'minutes', 'Amazing', 'Spiderman', 'knew', 'was', 'gon', 'first', 'hour', 'lot', 'exposition', 'being', 'tedious', 'actually', 'preferred', 'one', 'Raimi', 'versions', 'mainly', 'cuz', 'think', 'intensity', 'believability', 'previous', 'films', 'lacked.Marvel', 'be', 'producing', 'more', 'mature', 'rebooted', 'versions', 'super-hero', 'series', 'actually', 'prefer', 'variation', 'Spider', 'Man', 'story', 'as', 'well', 'especially', 'disappearance', 'pointless', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'obsession', 'always', 'made', 'respect', 'Spidey', 'little', 'less', 'suspect', 'more', 'scientifically', 'savvy', 'audience', 'ever', 'evolving', 'origins', 'story', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'initial', 'dealing-with-new-superpowers', 'interlude', 'was', 'very', 'amusing', 'again', 'just', 'seemed', 'much', 'more', 'realistic', 'reaction', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'new', 'abilities', 'Exceptional', 'performances', 'Peter', 'Gwen', 'are', 'what', 'truly', 'make', 'production', 'stand', 'out', 'other', 'action-packed', 'big-budget', 'flick', 'there', 'not', 'mention', 'truly', 'scary', 'menacing', 'super-villain', 'causing', 'sequences', 'play', 'little', 'horror', 'film', 'tragic', 'loss', 'uncle', 'intensely', 'emotional', 'making', 'motivation', 'becoming', 'vigilante', 'seem', 'more', 'credible', 'use', 'fantasy', 'tech', 'supplement', 'powers', 'added', 'as', 'well', 'love', 'Martin', 'Sheen', 'uncle', 'Ben', 'never', 'been', 'much', 'Sally', 'Fields', 'fan', 'apparently', 'producers', 'were', 'looking', 'star', 'power', 'offset', 'use', 'mostly', 'unknowns', 'starring', 'roles', 'think', 'was', 'stroke', 'brilliance', 'way', '.The', 'FX', 'action', 'sequences', 'are', 'seamless', 'gorgeous', 'captivating', 'again', 'convincing', 'hitting', 'alot', 'know', 'think', 'essential', 'factor', 'details', 'make', 'difference', 'job', 'dizzying', 'heights', 'getting', 'call', 'cell', 'aunt', 'May', 'reminding', 'pick', 'up', 'eggs', 'way', 'home', 'wise-cracking', 'Spidey', 'not', 'only', 'back', 'actually', 'funny', 'flawless', 'comedic', 'timing', 'gratuitous', 'Stan', 'Lee', 'cameo', 'was', 'priceless', 'new', 'Spider-man', 'better', 'one', 'one', 'whom', 'will', 'be', 'emotionally', 'invested', 'dramatic', 'ending', 'brilliantly', 'up', 'all-around', 'excellent', 'excellent', 'film', 'o']",The Amazing Spider-Man

I thought Tobey Maguire was one of the worst actors ever because he never changed expression and had a very dull personality in every single one of his movies, so I thought anything was better than him. The only real complaint I have about modern movies in general is the portrayal of high tech areas and labs and stuff, which this movie has a lot of. The way movies see to have this is the pull and push screen things, as if 3D rotational computer projects exist right now. All the keycard entry door panels have been replaced by ipods, seriously, that is what they are with a useless entry system that anyone can break. They even did the same thing with the fire alarm, a virtual fire alarm, that is freaking retarded and impractical. This issue is related to this movie, but Hollywood in general. The lesson is better story and less shiny, impractical crap that would never actually exist.As for the case, it was embarrassing to say the least... The blurays were in their holders like they should be along with the ultraviolet disc, but for those who have a DVD player, it was like a middle finger to them.

But as a standalone film it is quite good, very satisfying.  Andrew Garfield's Peter Parker is more a teenager and less a college freshman though he's also more competent and confident that we're maybe used to seeing him and that works just fine; after all, he is still a bit nebbishy.  The film draws out good performances from all parts and Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy was a coup of a casting choice--you just may forget Mary Jane!  And though the film sets us up for a mystery to unfold over a series of movies the real drawback to this movie is the villain; the Lizard is an iconic Spidey villain but flattening his face on film to make him a bit more anthropomorphized was a mistake and lessened his menace.Still, action fans will have a lot to love here and the film has heart.

I felt so snooty, having my own ""private screening""As for the movie, itself, a solid 2.5 out of 5 stars. The leads are good, Special Effects are nothing we haven't seen a million times by now, story is a rehash of the previous 3 movies. Hero loves girl, hero's mentor turns himself into psychopath, hero must save world from mentor.Minor spoilers below, so... you have been warned....Andrew Garfield's take on Peter Parker/Spider-Man is much less ""nerd"" (as Tobey Maguire was) as he is a ""social misfit"". While he is a genius-level intellect, he's extremely unskilled with personal interactions. As Spider-Man, he's far more relaxed than Maguire's Spidey.Emma Stone is Gwen Stacy, the love interest in the film. Unlike MJ (Kirsten Dunst) in the first three movies, Gwen is confident, charming, and not a ""damsel in distress"". She also is a bit of a social outcast, because she pretty, but also extremely smart, distancing her from both the ""in-crowd"" as well as the ""nerds"".Rhys Ifans is the ""villain"" of the pic, as Gwen and Peter's mentor, Doctor Conners/The Lizard. He also has a history with Peter's father. As a villain, he takes bits and pieces from the previous Spider-Villains. From Willem Dafoe's Green Gobin comes the ""talking to himself"" and the mysterious green gas that gives superpowers (in this case, lizard powers); from Alfred Molina's Doc Ock comes a sense of purpose to his behavior... he thinks he's going to rid the world of disease and minorities by making everyone the same; and finally, as The Lizard, he acts a lot like Spider-man 3's Venom... A lot of clawing, roaring, and leaping about.Dennis Leary, Martin Sheen, and Sally Field all have rather confusing turns as support characters who try to make the most of their scenes, but seem rather rushed. Martin Sheen's ""Uncle Ben"" is not nearly as endearing as Cliff Robertson's).  Sally Field as Aunt May looks to be on the border of a severe anxiety attack at any moment. She doesn't seem to be a ""pillar of strength"" that Aunt May was in the first 3 films.Dennis Leary play's the Police chief in charge of bringing in Spider-Man and The Lizard, and also happens to be Gwen's overprotective father. The most ""normal"" character in the film. His actions and motivation are very understandable.Special Effects were largely the same things seen in the past movies: skinny hero leaping and swinging from skyscrapers. There are some webspinning and wallcrawling shots that are done from the viewpoint of Spider-Man, which is kind of cool. Lizard effects were rather disappointing. The body was fine, but the face was weird. It didn't look like a lizard face, more like a Star Trek-ish alien face... Hard to explain...

1418214,A2YP1HYB6Q0JEQ,B004LWZWFQ,Todd7,"[1, 2]","It's pretty ridiculous these days when a movie series gets rebooted 5 years after the previous installment. How else can one sum up this premise, other than it's driven by greed? This is the Dark Knight mentality all over again; this time, it's Spider-Man. While this movie is for the most part good, I found myself somewhat bored, and asking myself, ""Is this a pointless movie, or what?"" This movie is basically the same as Spider-Man 2002 in terms of plot, characters, etc., only much worse. Tobey Mcguire did a spectacular job portraying Peter Parker in the 2002 movie, so why diminish and tarnish his efforts? And why does this reboot have a villain that isn't believable t all? A lizard? A CGI lizard? Andrew Garfield does a good job as Parker, but that's not enough to win me over to the reboot camp. I'm disturbed with what's going on in the movie industry these days; it's driven by greed, and fed off of an audience that demands something better than what came before (in this case, the 2002 movie was better). These reboots are dumbed-down to suit a generation of moviegoers who care less about plot and substance, and favor tons of action and eye candy.

1418215,A2U80IPZXN5V1U,B004LWZWFQ,Tommy Sixx Morais,"[188, 276]","There are only so many ways you can tell a superhero story, especially through a movie and you have the dodgy task of taking a popular superhero with the elements of his story try to breathe new life into it and adapt it to the big screen in a way that can reach a wide audience; families, kids, teenagers, adults and generations while at the same time making it appeal to the die hard superfans and collectors. This is the hard task that the 2012 reboot of the Spider-Man franchise The Amazing Spider-Man is attempting to achieve.Superhero films have received a revival in interest new since the first decade of the new millennium and throughout the 2000's to the current day. It's become a popular trend in Hollywood and already we've seen plenty of superheros head to the big screen; some with great mainstream success at the box office (X-Men, Spider-Man, Batman) and some poorly received (Daredevil, Superman Returns, Green Lantern). Spider-man is one of those superhero characters that caught on most as a movie franchise and was successful enough to spawn two sequels. The trilogy of Spidey films of the 00's was mostly well received but when attempts of re-singing actors for a fourth title failed there was only two options: 1) Give up on making more Spider-Man films in the near foreseeable future or 2) Get some fresh faces to replace the already established actors and come up with an alternate take on the story of one of the greatest Marvel characters and superheroes of all time. This reboot is a different Spider-man altogether and in this case it's actually a good thing. Garfield as Spider-Man was what was going to make or break this movie and his Peter Parker is a fresh one with slight twists that I think audiences will approve of. The retelling of the Spiderman story works here because they did an actual reboot, using the same characters and comic universe but it's a different take it's obviously not a remake yet it's not a re-imagining either being that this character has already plenty of history to chose from. If you watched any of the 3 previous ones you will be able to tell that the angle and tone they have here are very different. The back story already is quite different, they explain more about Peter Parker's parents, in this one his love interest is Gwen Stacy not Mary Jane Watson (and very different from the Gwen Stacy we saw in 2007's Spider-Man 3 too), the villain (Dr. Curtis ""Curt"" Conors/The Lizard), the way the events happen (how Peter gains his powers etc.) is not quite the same and the way its presented is unique which is all a plus in my book.A lot of us were wondering how Andrew Garfield (The Social Network) would fare as the lead role compared to Tobey McGuire (as if there weren't going to be any comparisons) and that it would directly make the biggest impact on the fate (and perhaps sequels) of this reboot. I must say I was impressed. MacGuire was cast for the trilogy of Spider-Man films from 2002-07 and I think most would say Tobey pulled off the job really well, came off as likeable and people tend to identify him in his role of the spandex web-slinger. Looking back McGuire was suitable and a good choice for the role but Garfield brings something else to the table, portrays the role different with more flair, more attitude. Not as shy and innocent as Macguire's portrayal of Spidey. Andrew Garfield's Spider-Man you can sense from the get-go is in ways better or improved on MacGuire's if comparisons must be made. He doesn't look as weak, is a bit more like the High-Schooler you would imagine, has the smart comments, is more aggressive and is taller and fills the suit better. Enough has been said, Garfied makes a rather convincing Peter Parker, student and Peter Parker as the masked hero. Those are both different Spider-Man overall, different takes on the same character and each have their positives but in the end I think I'd take Garfied over McGuire any day (no disrespect to Tobey intended I thought his take on the role was excellent and certainly put his stamp on the character). Emma Stone was very believable as Gwen Stacy and has that edge of the character she portrays and she looks the part, she has actual chemistry with Garfield and although we know her more for her comedy acting roles (Superbad, House Bunny, Easy A and others) she has no problem playing a more serious role and I could well see her do more of this type of acting. Uncle Ben (Martin Sheen) and Aunt May (Sally Fields) were nicely cast although I had grown very fond of the actors who played them in the trilogy of Spidey films and thought they were more effective than they are here. Rhys Ifanswas fantastic as Dr. Curt Conors/The Lizard and although there are lots of special effects for his transformation to being the Lizard I thought the human counterpart was played quite well and made his background story come through nicely. Also notable was Denis Leary as Captain George Stacy, Gwen's father.The fighting and action scenes are probably the greatest improvements over the first 3 titles. Not that it was bad in any of those films but the way they captured the action in this one was fantastic and simply superior and are bad-er and mean-er. Those sequences were well executed which is important in a superhero movie. The stunts came off looking somewhat less surreal yet amazing to watch. Instead of the hero shooting web from his wrists they go back to the original story with the artificial web-shooters which was a good idea. We even manage to feel something for the villain and the Lizard's backstory was always one of my favorites and the character looks fantastic on the big screen with details and texture; this is one cool looking villain, I cannot imagine Lizard being done better. I was very happy when they chose Kurt Conors as the villain and the result turned out fantastic, at least they didn't take one of the previously seen villains for this first chapter in the cinematic saga. Not that I'm against using a previous bad guy again but someone else was a good choice to begin. Something that I thought was particularly great is that we saw Peter Parker as a child a further glimpse at what made him who he is. In fact the first few minutes are of an ""origin of Peter Parker"" scene that gives the viewer more insight on the character. What they did with the story, the hero, the villain, the romance, the stunts is commendable, especially considering that this is taking an already successful movie franchise and trying to revive and do something different yet interesting with it that would keep fans an moviegoers excited about it.On a quick note I don't have much to say on the film's 3D probably because while it's not bad, it's not a big presence and the focus was mostly on the story and as a result there are very few times when the 3D stands out in any way.There are similarities between this film and the original Spider-Man but there is plenty of differences too (there's only so much you can change) and it doesn't come off as watching the same movie twice this series is moving forwards. Ultimately the fans will decide how this film will go down in movie history (and superhero movie history). All I have to say is I got my money and time's worth with The Amazing Spiderman, I was certainly not disappointed, I was pleasantly surprised and found it very enjoyable; definitely worthy of the ""Summer Blockbuster"" title. It think it's safe to say that the ""amazing"" in the title very well reflects the viewing experience as a whole and that this is one that fans and non-fans will enjoy.

I think my big problem with it is that it was so much like the other series that the movie didn't feel like it was needed at all. This isn't a fair comparison but the Chris Nolan ""Batman"" series was much, much different from the Tim Burton series that the re-boot felt fresh and original. This one just felt like...hey let's do ""Spider-Man"" again...OK. This may just be my opinion but there is nothing new and fresh in this movie compared to the others and to me that seems like a waste of a movie. This again though is a movie that people will watch regardless of any review written, but just so you don't get your hopes up don't really expect anything different or amazing.

1418218,A2UNMXBJSVIXFB,B004LWZWFQ,Tony Khamvongsouk,"[16, 28]","(Note: I will update this when I get the Blu-ray).So after a month, I finally made the time to go see this. Initially, I wasn't too excited by the teaser, but the full theatrical trailer really got me hyped when I saw what they did with the suit, how they choreographed some of the action, and how they produced the movie aesthetically. In fact, before going to see this, I refreshed myself on Sam Raimi's trilogy just for the sake of making a better comparison. That is to say, as a fan of the hit cartoon show from the '90s, Raimi nailed the style at the time, putting a very campy, over-the-top, and blatant ""comic book"" vibe to it. His trilogy was briskly-paced, vividly colorful, and at times, even a little silly for silly's sake (especially the third; in fact, I'd say it was a little too silly, even for Raimi), but that's pretty much been a staple of his ever since Army of Darkness. The first movie did a great job establishing the character of Peter Parker and his moral foundations, while the second took things to an even greater, more epic level by showing us the problems he would face wielding dual identities as both Peter and Spider-Man. But somewhere along the line, there was a falling out between Raimi and Sony Pictures, which is reflected a bit in the way Spider-Man 3 turned out. Eventually, they wanted to do a 4th film together, but Sony really pushed Venom, Raimi wanted to do Sandman, and the film ended up over-stuffed with villains, the writing got sloppy, Peter Parker turned emo, and here we are with a reboot just 5 years later.So how do things pan out for The Amazing Spider-Man? To start, I'm sad to say I've yet to see director Marc Webb's only other major motion picture, (500) Days of Summer. I hear it's a phenomenal romantic comedy that's highly regarded by many a movie-goer, and I'm sure a lot of what he achieved in that influenced the way the drama and romance are depicted in this new take on the Spider-Man franchise. That being said, even with this being the only exposure I've had to Webb as a film-maker, I was pleasantly surprised at the way things turned out.The story begins with a young Peter Parker playing hide and seek with his father. In looking for his father, Peter makes his way into the study only to see that it was burglarized by someone. Fearing for his son's safety, he takes him to his brother, Ben (Martin Sheen), to take care of him for the time being. Years pass until Peter (Andrew Garfield) is 18, and we're left with the mystery of what secret his father was hiding in the first place. Being the sort of scientific whiz kid that he is, Peter's curiosity eventually ends him up at the research facilities of one Dr. Curt Conners (Rhys Ifans), who worked with his father years ago to develop a kind of method for genetic splicing that would allow the combining of DNA between different species. But upon stumbling into a particular room filled with their genetically-enhanced spiders, Peter is bitten by one, only to discover a power that would change his life forever.First and foremost, my favorite aspect of the film is its art direction. After seeing the trailer, I thought this would have a slightly darker and more realistic/gritty feel to it, which it does. The color scheme isn't nearly as vibrant as what Raimi did, and is, instead, more bold with a lot of dark colors, a little more black, some dimmer lighting, and even takes into consideration the fact that as a high school student, Peter Parker (for the most part) only goes out as Spider-Man at night. Because of this, it definitely gives the whole ""masked vigilante"" persona a greater sense of intrigue, mystique, and even a kind of nocturnal elegance.Secondly, I love what they did with Spider-Man's costume. As I mentioned about Raimi's trilogy having more of a comic book feel, the spandex suit only made it seem even more campy. Here, they decide to opt for a mesh material that allows for more detail to be viewed in the weaving that, in my opinion, looks much more practical and stylish for the overall look of Spidey. I also like the eye pieces of the mask, as the practicality of those make even more sense when you see how he makes them in the movie itself. Color-wise, it appears to be slightly darker, but the material itself lends to a more shiny look for when he's out at night (which also makes it easier to see him). When the eventual special features on the Blu-ray come out and depending on how they explain the design of the costume and whether or not they CG'd certain sequences, I'll reserve a full analysis for then, but I'm happy with the way it turned out, for now.And speaking of CG, I was ecstatic with the way they handled the action. One of the things that really stuck out to me in the trailer was how Peter/Spidey did a lot of actual ground-based stunt work. Suffice it to say, a lot of the Spidey-action in the Raimi trilogy tends to be largely computer-generated. I can understand stuff like web-slinging across city streets from building to building or getting thrown 30 feet into a wall at high velocities, because why go through the trouble of rigging all that stuff up or getting someone hurt? It's the physical combat sequences that truly impress me. For any of you video game fans out there that have played any Capcom iteration of Spider-Man in any of their fighting franchises, it should go without question that Spidey's quick, agile, physical prowess is displayed to perfection. Aside from the obvious fights with The Lizard that would've been too difficult to stage physically, the parkour-esque running around on walls, the acrobatic flips and mid-air twists, and even the way he slinged his arms and shot his webbing felt a lot more in-tune with the character.As for the actual movie, it's definitely a change of pace. Raimi's trilogy was bright, fast, flashy, and exaggerated in his own quirky way, which I like. Webb's reboot, however, has more of a subtle, understated buildup to it. Written by James Vanderbilt (who did a marvelous job in David Fincher's Zodiac), the plot has a very methodical approach to the way things are revealed. In Raimi's first film, Peter got his powers and became Spider-Man in about 20-30 minutes. Here, Peter doesn't even think up the idea for a costume till almost 40-45 minutes. Instead, they use the preceding time to thoroughly develop a little bit of everyone, mainly: Peter, Gwen Stacy, and Dr. Conners. It also spends a good amount of time creating chemistry for Peter and Gwen as romantic interests, exposing Peter's knack for science, and, of course, showing us Uncle Ben with his words on the importance of responsibility. I've only seen Garfield in The Social Network, but he showed a lot of potential, and even more so as the new Peter Parker. His portrayal is considerably less peppy than Tobey McGuire's, but I feel he takes more initiative and has an even more pronounced screen presence when he's in the suit. Emma Stone as Gwen is just as charming as her other roles. Compared to the more lovey-dovey atmosphere that developed in the Raimi's franchise, I feel Stone's performance adds a different kind of sentiment that makes the whole relationship feel more natural, even cutesy at times. Rhys Ifans as Dr. Conners is good for what he's given, as is Martin Sheen. My biggest gripe, though, is Sally Fields as Aunt May. I've always liked Aunt May for what she stood for: Peter's moral authority and voice of guidance, but her character gets very little, if any, relevant moments to truly shine. I'm hoping they fix that in the sequels. Or if they opt not to focus on her wisdom, to at least give her as little screen time as possible, as I really don't want to see either the talent of Fields or the character of Aunt May go to waste.By the way, I saw this in 3D, and yes it is a native 3D film. In fact, it's the first-ever superhero movie to be entirely filmed in the format. Hooray for a non-conversion, finally. There's not a whole lot of 3D effect at first, as the beginning just doesn't lend itself to a whole lot of 3D immersion. Many of the shots either take place around a high school campus or in small housing sets. But boy, does it kick in after Peter becomes Spider-Man. Probably the most notable sequence of the 3D presentation is the first-person swing-views. When Peter is swinging across the city, it's absolutely breathtaking. It's as if you're right there being Spider-Man yourself running all over the place without any kind of boundary. Scenic shots over New York also look pretty outstanding, despite how dark it is. Because the buildings are so tall and everything on ground-level is so small in comparison, you really get a sense of scale for things. Field of depth is especially great in action sequences, with web shots and web traps taking the most precedence. My favorite scene is when Spider-Man is in the sewers laying web wires across all the drain tunnels to catch where The Lizard is hiding. Not only do the webs have an incredible amount of parallax for the 3D-pop effect, but the pose he strikes in waiting looks pretty cool, too. Definitely give this a 3D viewing if you can.Musically, as iconic as Danny Elfman's Spider-Man theme has been for pretty much the last decade, composer James Horner makes an excellent attempt at creating his own feel for this new adaptation. The score itself has a little bit of an Avatar feel to it, with a few inserts of a choral voice here and there, only minus the tribal vibe. It's a score that, much like the movie itself, is subtle and understated, but has the ability to really engage itself when the action picks up. Some of the more upbeat pieces derive a very faint resonance of the percussions Elfman used in his theme, but it's at a different enough tempo and composed with so many other motifs and instruments that it can definitely stand on its own. Much like any reboot, though, you just have to get used to it (though I had absolutely no problem when Batman transitioned from Elfman to Hans Zimmer; then again, it is Hans Zimmer). I will say, however, that as much as I love Elfman's main theme, I'd say the overall work by Horner for the rest of the film works slightly better to create more various moods. But again, both franchises have vastly different tones, as should be apparent by the visuals, storytelling, and what you hear in this score.Overall, I like this movie a lot. Some of the plot elements are similar between the two, but the general tone of each has their own ups and downs. The transition wasn't quite as dark and poetic as, say, Tim Burton's Batman films to Christopher Nolan's, but considering how disappointed I was with Raimi's 3rd film, this is a very welcome and refreshing entry to the Spider-Man mythos. One can only hope that the eventual trilogy for this iteration can keep up the good work, giving us a great balance of character development, empathy, and fast-paced action. I'm really looking forward to when this hits Blu-ray for all the special features.Rating: 4.5 / 5.0",5,The Amazing Spider-Man (3D) (Theatrical),1344384000,"08 8, 2012",2012,11019,"['Note', 'will',

1418219,AMF52GSX309V0,B004LWZWFQ,Tony S.,"[0, 1]","The Amazing Spider-Man is the reboot to the incredibly popular trilogy directed by Sam Raimi and starred Tobey Maguire as the web slinger.  It's only been 5 short years since Spider-Man 3, Raimi and Maguire's final crack at the superhero.  Sony decided to start a new, and here we are today.  Marc Webb became famous after 500 Days of Summer; he was tapped to direct this reboot.  Sony's decision had fans scratching their heads.  They doubted what the director of a romantic comedy could bring to the table of a big budget action film?  I'll get to that in a moment.  Then came the &#34;you can't win&#34; casting of Andrew Garfield.  I PERSONALLY was excited because I knew the calibur of actor that Garfield was.  Also cast was Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy, Peter Parker's love interest.  Rhys Ifans plays the villain in the movie, Dr. Curt Connors/The Lizard.  Denis Leary plays Gwen Stacy's father and the captain of the police department.  Rounding out the cast are Martin Sheen and Sally Field as Uncle Ben and Aunt May.  Let's go!What I liked about the film:Our New Spider-ManAndrew Garfield; I hate to say 'I told you so', but damn it I told you so.  The actor is terrific.  Physically, Garfield is more like the comic book hero than Maguire was (tall and skinny rather than short and ripped).  In my opinion, his take on the character was more grounded in reality than the previous trilogy.  Then again, everything in this movie was more grounded in reality than the previous trilogy, except maybe the villain.  Garfield gets to show off his acting chops in some great scenes with Emma Stone, Martin Sheen and Sally Field.  You believe the pain he feels about losing his parents and the mystery behind their leaving him.  Garfield's Peter Parker is not as big of a nerd as Maguire's, and that's a good thing.  Again, staying grounded in reality made for a better film I think.  Nice job.The Rest of the CastEmma Stone is one of my favorite young actresses today (and I have a bit of a crush on her too, don't tell anyone).  She plays the Gwen Stacy character pretty straight, with touches of vulnerability here and there.  The filmmakers used the Gwen character and not Mary Jane Watson, made famous by Kristin Dunst in the previous incarnation.  Gwen is equally as smart as Peter Parker, maybe even smarter.  And thank goodness they didn't take the damsel in distress act too far like ALL THREE of the previous Spider-Man films before it.  Dennis Leary didn't have much screen time but was really really good.  He has some awesome scenes in the movie I don't want to spoil here.  Martin Sheen and Sally Field made for great parental figures to our hero.  They were caring, loving and tough when they needed to be.  I liked how they were kept out of the action.  Unlike the time aunt May was swung around New York in previous films, come on!WritersJames Vanderbilt, Alvin Sargent and Steve Kloves wrote a superhero film within a love story.  That's what some of the best superhero films have been able to do.  Take for example Superman (1978); director Richard Donner has gone on record to say, if he could convince the audience that Superman and Lois Lane were in love, he could convince them an actor could fly.  Garfield and Stone's real life relationship shined on screen, their chemistry was undeniable.  The writers also chose to go the Batman Begins route, and focus on the man behind the mask.  And like Batman Begins, it's not until half way through the movie do we even see the character in spandex.  Like I've stated above, I liked how much the movie was grounded in reality and how it was about the people, not the action.The ScoreJames Horner (Avatar, Titanic) wrote a beautiful score.  Soft and caring when the movie was too, then grand and epic when it needed to be.  And also stealing from Batman Begins, Horner doesn't reveal Spider-Man's new theme until the climax of the film.  When scoring Batman Begins, Hans Zimmer stated that the character hadn't yet earned the theme, until the very end.  I thought that was an amazing way to use music to reflect the growth of a character.  Awesome.The Special Effects/ActionThe special effects and the action look different than any of the previous Spider-Man films.  The hero is acrobatic, and doens't rely on martial arts to defeat his attackers.  This is another way to stay grounded in reality.  Peter Parker is a nerdy kid, why would he know how to fight?  Instead he uses his speed and abilties to defeat his opponents.  Also important to note, Spider-Man's web shoots out of a device created by Parker, unlike the organic origin used by Maguire.  Another thing I enjoyed: the physics in the movie are accurate.  Spider-Man doesn't just magically swing from one building to the other without logical reason.  There's even a line in the movie explaining the physics.  Spider-Man has to swing forward while hooked to SOMETHING!  Sam Raimi ignored that tiny little fact.Marc WebbI was a doubter.  I doubted &#34;what the director of a romantic comedy could bring to the table of a big budget action film&#34;.  I was wrong.  His vision was the right one.  The one Sony should have used back in 2002 at the launch of the original franchise.  His new cast, the tone, the style and even his new camera use was awesome.  There are a few point of view shots that will have you wishing you were the hero.  He also opted to keep out the campy junk; like the wrestling, and the specifics of how Peter Parker created his costume.What I didn't like about the film:The VillainHold up, hold up, hold up.  Rhys Ifan did a wonderful job as Dr. Curt Connors.  The actor's turn to the dark side was great, he was very believable.  The motives for the change were my only gripe about the character.  Would the need to help millions push someone to do what the villain does in this movie?  Maybe not.  Is it a deal breaker?  Not at all.  The odds had to be great for our hero to be challenged, and the filmmakers did what they had to do to make it so.  The only other dislike is, I wish there was more of Martin Sheen as Uncle Ben!  I think the filmmakers could have treated the character with more care than they did.  Small price to pay for such a great film.The Verdict:I Finally Care About Spider-ManThank you Marc Webb for finally making me care what Spider-Man is up to.  As you can tell, I was never a fan of the original trilogy, much less the character himself.  Webb, Garfield and company have created a new world for the character to live in that far exceeds the previous.  This is a tough tough world we live in, and our movies need to reflect that; not the campy world Raimi projected through his films.  Even if you're not a comic book fan, you will very much appreciate this movie.  And lastly, The Amazing Spider-Man offers up the best Stan Lee cameo to date!",4,"The Amazing Spider-Man review, another worthy reboot",1356220800,"12 23, 2012",2012,6825,"['Amazing', 'Spider-Man',

Can you create something original using a character who was first introduced to the world in 1962?Peter Parker, age 4, (played by Max Charles) is playing hide and seek one night when he discovers someone has broken into his father's study. His father, Richard (played by Campbell Scott) sees this and takes some important papers, his wife Mary (played by Embeth Davidtz) and his son to the home of his Aunt May (played by Sally Field) and Uncle Ben (played by Martin Sheen). Peter is left in that home for his own safety and never sees his parents again. At least a decade later, Peter (played as a teenager by Andrew Garfield), is being bullied by an athlete named Flash Thompson (played by Chris Zylka) and has a crush on a student named Gwen Stacey (played by Emma Stone). When Peter returns home at the end of the day, bruised and beaten by Flash, he finds papers in his father's briefcase that show he once worked with a man named Dr. Curt Connors (played by Rhys Ifans). Connors works at a company named Oscorp, so Peter disguises himself as an intern to gain access to the lab and, hopefully, Connors. Little did he know, the tour for new interns was led by Gwen Stacey. She knows immediately that the ID badge that Peter's wearing belongs to someone else, but allows him to continue on the tour regardless. Peter sneaks away from the group and finds a lab filled with genetically-modified spiders that are producing biocable. As is often the case with people who bother animals for no reason, Peter gets bitten. Security eventually finds him and escorts him out of the building. While on the subway, he discovers that he gained far more than knowledge from his visit.Now, I saw the 2002 Spider-Man film starring Tobey Maguire and the 2004 sequel. I liked it initially, but over time, I grew tired of it. I thought 2004's Daredevil was a much better film, despite mixed reviews from moviegoers and critics. Not to mention, I believe Kirsten Dunst gave a less-than-stellar performance as Parker's love interest, Mary Jane Watson. Not to mention the irony of having blonde Kirsten Dunst dye her hair red to play Mary Jane Watson and then having redhead Emma Stone dye her hair blonde to play Gwen Stacey. Forgetting all that for a second, this was a much better film than the one we got from Sam Raimi. Director Marc Webb and company have created something with a much darker, more serious tone, a better story, and a solid conclusion.

1418226,A1FO24PIXHM3SG,B004LWZWFQ,T. RHEAULT,"[7, 14]","""The Amazing Spider-Man"" is a well-acted, well-produced, and well-directed origin story of the Wall Crawler.  It features an interesting villain and good special effects.After having just watched the movie, however, I cannot help but wonder about two things:1.  Why was this movie made when we had a very good Spider-Man origin movie just 10 years ago (a movie, I might add, that covered much of the same ground as this movie)?2.  What might have we gotten if Sony and Sam Raimi had put aside their creative differences (which date back to the third movie, when the producers essentially forced Raimi to include Venom in the film) and produced a fourth film in an amazingly (no pun intended) successful series of ""Spider-Man"" films?Point One: it is only a minor spoiler to say that ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" covers many of the plot points that Sam Raimi's 2002 film did- specifically, high school student Peter Parker getting bitten by a radioactive spider, learning to use his powers, learning a lesson about great power and great responsibility, and fighting a supervillain who threatens NYC.While I knew that this film would be a reboot, I hoped the writers would introduce some unexpected elements into the origin story.  This is not the case.  In fact, beyond being a reboot, ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" comes dangerously close to being a REMAKE of Raimi's 2002 original film in certain parts.  How?  Well, let's consider what the new film has in common with the 2002 original Spidey movie (minor spoilers):a.  Peter Parker in high school bullied by Flash Thompson?  Check.b. Peter bitten by the radioactive spider while on a science trip for his school?  Check.c. Peter selfishly letting a crook go, resulting in Uncle Ben being killed? Check.d. Spider-Man fighting a quasi-father figure supervillain (who even hears voices in his head after undergoing a transformation, a la Norman Osborn in the original film)?  Check.e. Peter tearfully deciding to let go of his love interest after a funeral at the end of the movie?  Quasi-check (see the movie to decide this one for yourself).The one twist that the movie attempts to introduce is that of Peter's parents, and what became of them when they left Peter with Ben and May Parker.  However, after devoting the first 10 minutes of the movie to Peter's parents, they are mostly forgotten and hardly mentioned the rest of the movie.It has been reported that Sony apparently had to make a Spider-Man movie or else risk losing the franchise to Disney/Marvel.  It is difficult to say for certain that this affected the production of the movie, but certain elements of the film do have a perfunctory feel to them- for example, the aftermath of Uncle Ben's murder (no funeral or discussion about the event by Peter and Aunt May), or the transformation of Dr. Connors into the Lizard.I take nothing away from the fine acting of Andrew Garfield (who makes a good Spider-Man) or Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy, or the directing by Marc Webb.  They put in solid work; it is just a shame that they were not- at least in this first movie- given the opportunity to add something new to the Spider-Man film universe.Point Two:  while promoting the movie, the producers have repeatedly said their first preference was to make a fourth movie with Raimi and Tobey Maguire, but that ""there was no story"" and that the ""trilogy had run its course.""Hogwash.Spider-Man 4 had script drafts commissioned by James Vanderbilt, David Lindsay-Abaire, Gary Ross, and- just as the film was cancelled- veteran Spidey writer Alvin Sargent.  Apparently Raimi and the producers had decided on the Vulture as the villain, and it was reported that discussions had begun with John Malkovich to play him.Sony: are you seriously telling us that, between all of the scripts that had been commissioned, with 50 years of comics for inspiration, with the creativity of a Sam Raimi as your director, that a good story/script couldn't have been cobbled together for a fourth movie?  Please.With an interesting villain in the Vulture, the continuing of the Peter Parker/Spider-Man story as he entered his early to mid 30's, and perhaps even finally marrying Mary Jane Watson (which had been hinted at in Spider-Man 3), a fourth Spider-Man movie would have likely been an interesting and unique addition to the overall Spider-Man story that had been carefully built up over the course of three movies.What we got instead was a perfectly decent (even good) movie, and yet a movie that was too......familiar.Still, I give this movie 4 out of 5 stars, but hope we get a new and different story in the next Spidey movie.",4,Good Yet Overly Familiar Spider-Man Movie,1341273600,"07 3, 2012",2012,4612,"['Amazing', 'Spider-Man', 'well-acted', 'well-produced', 'well-directed',

1418227,A3MG6ECEYK0KYM,B004LWZWFQ,TrueNerd,"[6, 12]","This movie is at best redundant and unnecessary and at worst a hollow mess. Doing the origin story again only ten years after we first saw it was stupid. Especially when you're hitting all the same beats and doing it worse. I don't think anything during the origin bits works as good here as it did in Rami's SPIDER-MAN. Everything is more contrived and feels like it's just hitting a checklist.I think worse than that are the things this movie tries to do that are new. It can't commit to anything. The whole secret about Peter's parents is abandoned almost as quickly as it's introduced. (I can't believe they're still marketing that stuff for the DVD release.) Same goes for the whole searching for Uncle Ben's killer plot line. The Lizard is also a terribly uninteresting villain whose motivations are not sympathetic at all. Connors just becomes a pure bad guy when he's changed. Also what happened to that SWAT team that got turned into lizard people? They're changed and never seen again. A nitpick, sure, but the movie is constantly pulling this stuff. It adds up.The love story stuff isn't good either. Yes, Stone and Garfield have good chemistry together but the relationship is written terribly. There's no conflict to it. They like each other right away and then they date and they never have any problems. It's boring. Also, what's the deal with the mumblecore exchanges between the two of them?However, the WORST thing about this movie is the very last line of the movie, in which Peter happily goes back on a pretty big promise he made another character a few scenes earlier. It's awful because it shows his character has had no growth. He starts the movie as a selfish douche and that's exactly how he ends it. This is especially weird because the montage directly before that last scene makes you think that Peter has finally learned what it means to be a hero and then no, no he hasn't.I would give this two stars cuz it is at least watchable, but I dunno why you would watch this instead of Raimi's trilogy, even the third one. You can call those movies campy, but they at least understand competent storytelling. Also only one star because it was stupid to do the origin story again.

1418230,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B004LWZWFQ,Tsuyoshi,"[12, 24]","It's been only ten years since we saw the first installment of the ""Spider-Man"" trilogy directed by Sam Raimi. My simple question is, do we really need another one now? The Hollywood studios seem to think so, but entertaining as it is, ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" almost made me think otherwise.The storyline is basically the same as that of the 2002 version. By saying ""the same"" I mean the same theme, not characters. ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" follows the process of how an ordinary high school student Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) gains superpowers and learns how to use them. There is a love interest, Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone), not Mary Jane Watson. One major difference is inclusion of Peter's parents and their mysterious disappearance.So far, so good. But somehow they chose the wrong director for the job, Marc Webb of ""(500) Days Of Summer"" fame. His direction is slick and each scene is done professionally, but as a whole the film seems inconsistent in tone and pacing. In short, what does Peter Parker want to do? Finding his parents? Finding the robber with a star tattoo on his wrist? In the second half of the film both storylines are forgotten, superseded by the third one.This time around, it is Dr. Curt Connors / the Lizard - a character played by Dylan Baker in the original ""Spider-Man 2"" and ""3"" - whom Spider-Man has to fight, or save. In the 2012 version the doctor the Oscorp Laboratories is played by understated Rhys Ifans. Though I think he did a very good job as tormented Dr. Connors, the effects of the Lizard are simply disappointing, and the fight sequences between the two are done without much creativity. In fact, the special effects of the entire film are decent, but not outstanding.The process of Peter finding his new abilities and creating the trademark costume looks contrived and is often rushed. To understand how to use his powers, Peter has to beat up the subway passengers (and they are no criminals) and do a Parkour-inspired chase in the street. In the new version the Spider-Man is certainly described as a more vulnerable hero, and that's not a bad idea, but the way it is shown to us needs improvement.As you know, Marvel is ready for a new string of films based on its superheroes, and as to Spider-Man a sequel will be coming sooner or later (don't miss the film's post-credit footage). I hope whoever writes the script next time will find a better story for Peter Parker or Spider-Man.",3,Amazing ...

When 'Spider-Man 3' came out however, I was looking for a bucket to puke in. So now, after many years and rumors we have...new director, new cast, new Spider-Man. I for one feel that this 'Amazing' Spider-Man...is not so amazing.Here is what works in this film, the acting. It is a great cast, Andrew Garfield, Emma Stone & Rhys Iffans did a wonderful job in their roles. The special effects, you can tell how far we have come even though the original's effects where truly ahead of the time. The story...no. Way too dark too many people crying every 15 seconds it just didn't work for me. People say that Spider-Man is a dark story, but darn it I don't see it. Every depiction of Spider-Man I have seen just has never been so gloomy. Even in the comics while there are very complex stories they are always a fun read. I didn't find 'The Amazing Spider-Man' fun. Now, of course there is no turning back which a sequel on the horizon again with a good cast and a new villain that has yet to make his big screen debut and will I see it...I may. I just wish that when you try it the first time you shouldn't ruin what you have. 'Spider-Man 3' should have been re-shot to actually be good and personally I felt Topher Grace got shafted.

These first movies are all set up.  Then the second movies fly high till the final 3rd act is climax.  Yep, that's my incredibly deep and original thought free of charge.  Anywho, this movie is great cause it isn't that first trilogy's take on Spider-Man.  Sam Raimi is great but whoa man did he screw up the Spider Man movie.  I spent the entire decade complaining bitterly about those movies cause the despair of the prequel trilogy by Lucas was too much for my heart to handle.Still though this is no 5 starrer.  And Ima gonna tell you why.  If they put me in charge of Spider Man flicks I'd keep Peter Parker in high school for at least the first 3 installments.  And I'd keep them movies cranking out 1x a year minimum.  And I'd hire a 14year old to play the role.  Asa Butterfield keep your phone nearby.  I'd have the kid play Peter Parker and then I'd have a stunt man in the Spider Man outfit.  Keep the production rolling fast.  Most of what we see of Spider Man is CGI anyways.  The preposterous conceit of having the actor in the outfit or even on set for the SpiderMan scenes is unnecessary nonsense.And those movies would have one main villian per movie with no silly over-arching dramatic arc.  The story of Peter Parker as Spider Man is the conflict of Peter Parker being Spider Man not fighting some villian.  It's why The Dark Knight trilogy works!  The final conflict in the movies happened after the villain died-not because the villian died.  So go ahead and plagiarize me you film majors-i want the truth out there more than the credit.And enough of this trilogy nonsense.  Bond doesn't need no trilogy.  Bond keeps movies cranking out on 2-3 year cycles (when the producers and studios aren't in the court room.)  So what if one installment is terrible if you know another is coming out the next year. There would always something to love about the Spider Man movies if they stuck true to the vision and heart inherent to the story if it came out yearly.  But it would all be dependent on the fan boys keeping with realistic expectations.  Every movie doesn't need to have one great incredible over the top better than the last one climax.  Some stories end huge, sure why not.  But other times the story is more of a slow burn or builds on the character.

1418248,A2ZFHK015YXP6U,B004LWZWFQ,Wild1138,"[23, 37]","Lets get something straight, you don't HAVE to choose which take on Spiderman you prefer. Know one says you can't like The Amazing Spiderman if you liked Raimis' trilogy. You can have BOTH. You don't HAVE to choose. Also, some people are saying ""THIS is the TRUE take on Spiderman"" or ""Sam Raimis Spiderman was the REAL Spiderman"" this is FALSE. One thing I love about the Spiderman character is that there are multiple takes you can spin on the character. Raimis' Spiderman trilogy was the more classic 60s cheasy Spiderman, while this movie is a little more modern for a take on Spiderman. There is no ""true"" take on the character, see? Personally (as a big Spiderman fan), I actually ended up enjoying this movie and the old trilogy EQUALLY.Now That THAT'S out of the way, The Amazing Spiderman pretty much started production once Spiderman 4 was cancelled. I was really looking forward to Spiderman 4 at the time, and when they decided to reboot the series, I was pretty ticked off. Don't get me wrong, if they had just made Spiderman 4 to give that series a conclusion, I would have been perfectly fine with a reboot. To me, a reboot just didn't seem necessary. In my opinion, the only purpose in rebooting a franchise is if the series had a strong ending, or if the latest entry was so terrible that it would be time to try something new. Looking back, Spiderman 3 did have a good ending to that trilogy overall, but this reboot still came out WAY to soon. 5 years, really? WAY to soon.Once the first trailer and marketing began for The Amazing Spiderman, I decided to finally accept that the trilogy is done, and this reboot is really happening. Now, after seeing the film, it's very good, and does a great job at separating itself from Raimi's trilogy. However, there is ALOT of hit and miss with this film.The plot is pretty simple. Peter Parker is a nerdy, geeky teen at high school. When he gets bitten by a radioactive spider however, he develops ""amazing"" spider-like powers. Laters, to avenge the death of a loved one, he becomes the superhero ""Spiderman"" with his new abilities. Along the way, he develops a romance with a crush, and later must come face to face with the villain ""the Lizard"" a powerful creature Spiderman is (ironically) responsible for.The POSITIVES:-Most of the cast was great. I loved almost each portrayel as I did with the cast in the old trilogy. Andrew Garfield did just as good a job as Tobey Maguire, while giving a very different take on the character.-The effects and action were very good. Not improved over the old trilogy by THAT much, but still very good.-MOST of the writing was really good. They did a great job at establishing this new world for future movies.-The dircting was great. The film was paced very well.-If there is one thing that was ""improved"" comparing this to the old trilogy, it's Gwen Stacy. I actually thought Gwen Stacy was both written and acted very well in Spiderman 3, but, Emma Stone stole the show whenever she was on screen. Also, the love story was very good in the old trilogy, but, it's REALLY good in this movie. Garfield and Stone did a great job together.The NEGATIVES:-The biggest problem with this film is how it never feels that ""necessary"". Say what you will about Spiderman 3, but it certainly wasn't TERRIBLE. The trilogy just didn't feel ""complete"" at the time. A reboot to compare this to is Batman Begins. Why did Batman Begins work as a reboot? It was a reboot that NEEDED to happen (considering the last Batman film we had before this was the horrible Batman and Robin). Also, Batman Begins was a VERY different film in comparison to ""Batman, 1989"". The Amazing Spiderman, however, is another origin story. Although Amazing Spiderman is very different from ""Spiderman, 2002"" there is still writing that is almost identical (with it being another origin story). If this came out BEFORE ""Spiderman, 2002"" this movie would have seemed much better. But, watching this, there are differences for the sake of it, so you can't help but think ""this scene is almost identical to the first film"" or ""that was changed ONLY to be different from the original"", so that can be a problem while viewing this movie.-In terms of casting, almost all the actors did a great job. However, the one character I thought was MUCH better in the old trilogy is Uncle Ben. The actor in this film is OK, but isn't nearly as good as the original actor.-Another big problem with this movie is the Lizard. For one thing, the character design isn't BAD, but it reminds me WAY to much of Killer croc from Batman: The animated series (just with a tail)The CGI was great, but I didn't care for the design at all. Some people are trying to defend this design beacause it's based off of the ""original"" Lizard character (because of him not having a snout) BUT, when you compare the designs, they are still VERY different. Also, I personally thought the Lizard character was written the weakest out of all the characters, which is a shame considering he is the main villain. They had a great build up and origin for the character, but once he was established, it seemed like they ran out of ideas. As a villain, I thought his character was written REALLY badly in the climax.-This film was promoted as ""the untold story"" but in reality, they don't give you much more information than what you got in the old trilogy. Specifically, they HEAVILY marketed a plot premise in this film, which is the fate of Peters parents. Unfortunately, everything you get in this movie about his parents is pretty much given to you in the trailers. There isn't any plot twist or ""reveal"" given at all, as the trailers promised.-And another thing I hated? MORE false advertising! In the trailers,there are a few lines of dialogue that aren't heard (or even hinted at) in the film: ""Did you actually think that what happend to you Peter, was an accident?"" and ""If you want the truth Peter, come and get it!"" I swear, there is NO WAY these lines were cut from the film without there being changes in the writing first, NOTHING like these lines were even hinted at in the film.-The 3D. I didn't HATE the 3D, but it is converted, which I was not aware of. There are 1 or 2 cool scenes in 3D, but that doesn't make up the ticket price. This movie just is NOT worth paying the 3D price, which is a shame considering Spiderman is a PERFECT concept for a 3D movie.Overall, the biggest things that weigh this movie down is the poor writing of the Lizard, and that you can't help but think of the old Spiderman trilogy in some scenes, which takes the fun out of the experiance. But hey, Spiderman is one of my favorite super heros, and I thought they did an excellent job in this new direction. Like I said, there is no ""true"" take on the character. Tobey Maguire did a great job with his performance, and Andrew Garfield gives a great performance to. Overall, The Amazing Spiderman isn't quite ""amazing"" but it is just as good as Spiderman 1 and 3 (just not nearly as good as Spiderman 2) So, if you didn't care for the ""classic 60s"" take on Raimis' Spiderman movies, you should have a good time with this one. A solid 4 out of 5 star superhero flick. :)",4,"Just as good as Raimis' Spiderman and a good reboot, but, not completely necessary.",1349913600,"10 11, 2012",2012,7179,"['Lets', 'get', 'something',

I enjoyed the first two installments of Raimi's trilogy, but Spider-man 3 went off the rails with two many villains and strange character choices. Andrew Garfield's portrayal of Peter Parker as a cocky teenager is more appealing than Maguire's nebbishy dork.

1418250,A3BOH0F7V12H7O,B004LWZWFQ,William Kendall,"[5, 13]","""With great power comes great responsibility. And emotional angst. And years of questioning your own decisions. And occasionally calling the whole superhero thing quits, only to reconsider that decision. Did I mention the angst?"" ~ Peter ParkerWell, a decade after the last Spider-Man trilogy of films by Sam Raimi began, and five years after the last of those films, along comes The Amazing Spider-Man, a reboot of the film franchise returning Peter Parker to the beginning again with a new cast, a new director, and all in 3D if you're not careful which screening you're walking into (don't go into the 3D screening, okay? Well, don't blame me if your stomach does that whole spinning in circles thing; I did warn you). It seems obvious that I'd go see this film, particularly because I'm a fan of the character. Before I get started though, I'd just like to get one thing out of the way.I want to track down the imbecile who coined the term reboot. I want them dead. Sleeping with the fish. Rubbed out, knocked off, encased in cement, congressionally investigated. Same goes for their family, their friends, their acquaintances. Their pets can go in peace; we can't hold the idiocy of humans against the pets, but seriously... I really, really, really, really hate the word reboot. Hate, hate, hate it. Did I mention I hate it?Okay. Got that out of my system. Shall we begin?The film by director Marc Webb retells the origin story of Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield), an outsider in high school. His parents leave him with his aunt May and Uncle Ben (Sally Field and Martin Sheen), vanishing when he's a child. He's a smart kid, trying to live up to the example of his aunt and uncle, who are, after all, inherently decent people (though younger than I'd picture the characters, in fact). Peter winds up at OsCorp labs one day, where his life is altered forever by the bite of a certain spider, which of course infects him and grants him the powers he'll soon be known by. He also crosses paths with Doctor Curt Connors (Rhys Ifans), a scientist working for the unseen Norman Osborn (a big bad in the comics universe who's otherwise known on a bad day as the Green Goblin). Osborn, it seems, is dying, and Connors (seen in the Raimi trilogy as one of Peter's professors, and played by Dylan Baker) is working on a cure.Peter gets used to his powers, making a mistake that inadvertantly leads to the death of his uncle, which as any comics fan will tell you becomes the central motivating factor for the rest of his life. He becomes Spider-Man as atonement, becoming involved with a classmate, Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone), meeting her father George, a police captain (Denis Leary). Connors meanwhile makes himself a test subject in his own work, and as usually happens in these things, it goes wrong. He becomes a human-reptilian hybrid monster otherwise known as the Lizard (one of the other big bads in the comics universe) and starts wrecking havoc. Out of this, of course, two opposing forces must collide.The new film works fairly well. Webb, whose previous work is really based on a character drama, 500 Days of Summer does his best work in terms of character dynamics in the film. Fortunately that's where the emphasis of the film is, and special effects are secondary. The action sequences and set pieces are hampered slightly- but only because we're reminded of the Raimi films. The CGI work from the first of those films was underdeveloped, so we were never really convinced that this was more than a CGI Spidey swinging through the streets at times- when the high wire work wasn't practical, that is- but that was rectified in time for the second film, which was the best of the trilogy, and featured the best action sequences. Comparing that one to this film, the action sequences here don't match up in quality, but it's a minor quibble. The CGI looks believable, which is required in a film like this, and the high wire style of work that Garfield takes part in blends in well with the CGI aspects. The look of Spidey is favourable; the costume is slightly modified from the Raimi films, which tend to be even closer to the comics version, but the modifications are small ones. And it's a wise decision that Peter designs artificial webshooters, a long time comics standard that was ignored in the Raimi trilogy in favour of organic webbing.Now to the cast. Garfield has more of a wisecracking sensibility about him than Tobey Maguire's take on the character in the previous films. He looks young enough to pass for the character (though they'd better move him up to college next time out). He plays the character properly, I think, someone on an emotional arc that revolves around the sense of responsibility that's so integral to the role. And he really looks the part. Emma Stone is a good Gwen Stacy, and it was right to go with this character instead. She's not the girl next door, but she's very appealing, and the two actors inhabit the roles well.Denis Leary dials down the usual snark (though I like the snark) for George Stacy, the policeman who's wary of the webbed vigilante. Ifans makes a decent villain; he's been known more for comedy, but he's not as good as Alfred Molina's Doctor Octopus, who was far and away the best villain of the Raimi films. And from the CGI side of things, I thought the look for the Lizard was, well, a bit off. And Sally Field and Martin Sheen convey the decency of the roles, the two guiding forces in Peter's life, with the grace and warmth you'd expect of these two characters.One big missing part of the film: no J. Jonah Jameson. In the Raimi films, J.K. Simmons played the part of the newspaper publisher and rabid loather of Spider-Man to absolute perfection. Peter in fact isn't working at a newspaper in this film, a situation I hope gets rectified in the sequel. I really, really missed the motormouth of Jolly Jonah, and it seems to me that Spider-Man needs this particular loudmouthed nemesis to bicker with. Just as much as the reverse is true.And so there will be sequels. The leads have a good chemistry together in this one, the screenwriters give us a story that's focused on character over roller coasters, and the director runs with it. If Webb returns for the sequel, he can polish up his pacing on the action sequences a bit, but he's done well this time out. I look forward to what's to come.",5,Along Came A Spider,1344384000,"08 8, 2012",2012,6367,"['great', 'power', 'great', 'responsibility', 'emotional', 'angst', 'years', 'questioning', 'own',

We watch this just to see Spidey, but we do not get a spectacular storyline with interesting villains or Marvel cameos, etc.  They could have done so much more.  What a shame.  This movie was like watching a rerun on a boring Sunday afternoon.",2,Spider Flop,1357948800,"01 12, 2013",2013,574,"['effects', 'are', 'excellent', 'acting', 'great', 'story', 'lame', 'did', 'not', 'need', 'origin', 'story', 'slow', 'ho-hum', 'interesting', 'places', 'have', 'already', 'been', 'characters', 'action', 'limited', 'Compare', 'movie', 'Iron', 'Man', 'films', 'Avengers', 'example', 'watch', 'just', 'see', 'Spidey', 'do', 'not', 'get', 'spectacular', 'storyline', 'interesting', 'villains', 'Marvel', 'cameos', 'etc', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'What', 'shame', 'movie', 'was', 'watching', 'rerun', 'boring', 'Sunday', 'afternoon']",The Amazing Spider-Man

The cockiness at the beginning when he got his powers was so believable it was so atypical way a teenager would have acted if he/she got powers and then the subtle way he got into the role of actually being a super hero. Gwen Stacy played by the amazing Emma Stone was perfectly cast yes she doesn't have any powers but she was not a whimpering screaming for help damsel she would fight with the best of them if she got the opportunity.For those of you who grew up on the comic would love this version of Spidey. Highly recommend.,5,This is Spiderman,1355356800,"12 13, 2012",2012,736,"['Not', 'say', 'previous', 'Spiderman', 'movies', 'were', ""n't"", 'good', 'just', 'never', 'got', 'Tobey', 'McGuire', 'Spiderman', 'definitely', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'Spiderman', 'grew', 'up', 'cockiness', 'beginning', 'when', 'got', 'powers', 'was', 'so', 'believable', 'was', 'so', 'atypical', 'way', 'teenager', 'would', 'have', 'acted', 'he/she', 'got', 'powers', 'then', 'subtle', 'way', 'got', 'role', 'actually', 'being', 'super', 'hero', 'Gwen', 'Stacy', 'played', 'amazing', 'Emma', 'Stone', 'was', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'yes', ""n't"", 'have', 'powers', 'was', 'not', 'whimpering', 'screaming', 'help', 'damsel', 'would', 'fight', 'best', 'got', 'opportunity.For', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'comic', 'would', 'love', 'version', 'Spidey', 'Highly', 'recommend']",The Amazing Spider-Man
