1515198,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B006GVMZNM,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[0, 0]","Former punk punk musician and Versace model Dito Montiel has come a long way in his life and career.  In 1989, Montiel and his band Gutterboy received notoriety when their band signed a $1 million record deal with Geffen Records and after cashing in with a big recording contract, the band was dropped by the label.The experience would lead Montiel to writing a best-selling book titled ""A Guide to Recognizing Your Saints"" and would follow with a film adaptation which he wrote and direct.In that film, Montiel worked with actor Channing Tatum (""G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra"", ""Dear John"", ""Step Up"") for the very first time and worked together in the 2009 film ""Fighting"".In 2011, Montiel would write and direct his third film ""The Son of No One"" and would reunite with Channing and the independent film would also feature talents Al Pacino (""The Godfather"", ""Scarface""), Ray Liotta (""Goodfellas"", ""Smokin' Aces""), Katie Holmes (""Batman Begins"", ""Go"", ""Dawson's Creek"") and Juliette Binoche (""The English Patient"", ""Blue"", ""Dan in Real Life"").The film was selected to close the 2011 Sundance Film Festival.VIDEO:""The Son of No One"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (widescreen 2:35:1).  The picture quality is fantastic as there is great clarity, detail and good use of cool and warm colors.  Black levels are deep, skin tones are natural and possibly the best part of this Blu-ray release is its visual presentation.Cinematographer Benoit Delhomme (""1408', ""The Boy in the Striped Pajamas"", ""The Proposition"") did a wonderful job and great choices on the film's lighting and Benoit's cinematography looks fantastic on Blu-ray!AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""The Son of No One"" is presented in English Dolby Digital 5.1 and Spanish Mono.  The film is primarily a dialogue-driven film but there are moments such as Jonathan's car being rammed or a scene with multiple gun shots that does utilize the surround channels.  But it's dialogue and surround environments and its ambiance that plays the biggest role in the lossless soundtrack.Subtitles are in Spanish.SPECIAL FEATURES""The Son of No One"" comes with the following special features:Audio Commentary - Featuring an in-depth audio commentary by writer/director Dito Montiel and executive producer/editor Jake Pushinsky.  Although this is one commentary that I wish was fluid, as there are some momentary gaps.Extended Scenes - (6:27) Featuring extended scenes from ""The Son of No One"".Trailer - (2:29) The original theatrical trailer for ""The Son of No One"".JUDGMENT CALL:If there is one major positive I can say about Dito Montiel films, it's the fact that he is able to bring together an impressive cast for his films.From his working relationship with Channing Tatum for three films, while ""A Guide to Recognizing Your Saints"" featured impressive casting, ""The Son of No One"" is quite intriguing that you have Al Pacino and Juliette Binoche starring in this indie crime thriller.With that being said, it's great to see Channing Tatum taking on a different type of role that he is cast in.  Usually, he is cast in younger roles or military roles but this time around, he's a family man with a wife and kid and one mysterious past.  It's a role that doesn't require too much emotion and if anything, the character role suits Tatum very well!As a cop, who along with a few others are keeping a secret that the main protagonist, Jonathan, murdered two junkies when he was young and living in the projects.  While the film had potential, the pacing was interrupted by constant flashbacks and uninspired acting.  And for a solid cast, you would think these talents would be better utilized.  Especially if you have Al Pacino in your film.I wish I could say that Al Pacino was magnificent but he was barely utilized in the film. Sure, his character plays a pivotal role but I wish his character had much more going on, than these few short scenes.Casting Tracy Morgan for a crime thriller, may seem a bit odd.  But Tracy Morgan was much easier to take-in as there are no in-your-face jokes or outrageous behavior.  If anything, he does a fine job of playing a restrained character who is emotionally messed up!  No wisecracking at all. This is probably the most serious role I have seen him star in and while he wasn't utilized all that much, during his scenes...he did a good job playing a serious role.Ray Liotta in a film is a giveaway.  If you seen his films, you know what kind of character he will be. And that's all I have to say about Liotta, without giving too much away.And last, we have Katie Holmes.  She plays the sweet, caring wife but there is unexplored areas that I found a bit frustrating because as a wife who is concerned about your husband, somehow her role was shut down after a major emotional scene.  It's unfortunate because her role could have been explored much more, but she seems to have disappeared during the last leg of the film's storyline.Once again, this is the problem I have with ""The Son of No One"".  Character utilization was poor, seemed rushed and while the plot had potential, this back-and-forth between present-time and flashbacks seem to hurt the pacing of the film.  If anything, would rather have less focus on the young actors, more focus on the major talents of this film.With that being said, ""The Son of No One"" is not a terribly bad film.  In fact, the film featured awesome cinematography from Benoit Delhomme and an intriguing crime thriller that kept you interested.  It's an intriguing film but when it comes down to it, the screenplay does feel as if it was rushed.  For a film with a strong cast, I also wish that there was better utilization of the characters during the present-time storyline.As for the Blu-ray release, the picture quality is fantastic and as for special features, the audio commentary was quite interesting, despite the momentary commentary gaps.Overall, ""The Son of No One"" may appeal to Channing Tatum fans or anyone that enjoys popcorn crime thriller.",3,"(2.5 stars) ""The Son of No One"" will appeal to Channing Tatum fans and those who enjoy popcorn crime thrillers.",1336176000,"05 5, 2012",2012,5976,"['Former', 'punk', 'punk',

1515200,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B006GVMZNM,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[3, 3]","THE SON OF NO ONE (Dir. Dito Montiel, 2011, 95 minutes) is an intense, chilling mystery that must have been written by one cop-hating individual! A further detail must be indicated: this was first released in Russia. Can someone PLEASE explain to me why I am seeing good American film, shot in America, American production and studio, American actors, opening in weird places like Russia, Bulgaria, the Caucasus Mountains?! Please?Officer Jonathan White (the ultra-hot and talented Channing Tatum) is a shell-shocked young cop, stuck in a weird precinct in New York where his deceased father once served. The year is 2002, the city is on high alert (for no reason as we now know) and Jonathan's childhood is coming back to haunt him horribly. This is no paranormal garbage - it is all too real, I suspect, for the poor masses huddled in gigantic, drug-plagued projects.Flashbacks to 1986: in the horrible gigantic projects, young Jonathan dwells with his elderly grandmother. Living in perpetual fear of the scumbags who plague the apartments, drug dealers and child molesters alike, young Jonathan mysteriously gets his hands on a gun. We are not told, but are able to guess, he wants protection. His father already killed in the line of duty, Jonathan has only his friend Vinnie (originally offered to Terence Howard but played by Tracy Morgan).A filthy, deranged drug pusher breaks into an apartment and Jonathan shoots him in the head, Pure reflex and a child's sad luck, but it is an expert bull's eye. He and Vinnie throw the man into the trash. Later, as Jonathan is fending off another drug dealer who is trying to extort him, Jonathan pushes him down some stairs and kills him also. Out of the gloom comes a mysterious police detective (Al Pacino, in a role originally offered to Robert De Niro) to reassure Jonathan about the whole thing.Thus the present, with which Officer Jonathan White has to live. He is an a hell-on-earth-precinct, unable to fathom why he has been transferred there. His captain (Ray Liotta) seems to have a love-hate relationship with him, and soon mysterious letters begin to arrive about the two unsolved murders from 1986. Jonathan cannot understand anything, nor is he able to honestly come to grips with his karma.I will not spoil the story, though ultimately it's a mystery about who is resurrecting the past murders, and why. The audience will solve that mystery fairly quickly, but the nepotism and buddy/buddy system in the force will certainly mystify anyone not intimate with it already.What I also want to know is this: with such a brilliant, creepy story, why was this so poorly shot and terribly directed? Why is most of the dialogue swallowed, mumbled or else shouted line-over-line? In other words, where is the pride American film should have in itself? I see none of that pride here. No wonder this opened in Russia. Like so many of these films, it cost over $15 million to make and grossed a laughable $28,000. To me, those numbers always mean something.Since I am an anthropologist even when watching film - in fact I created a new area of study known as cinemanthropology - I must address the color of Channing's eyes. Channing and I share a condition known as central/sectional heterochromia iridum. This means a person has more than one eye color in concentric rings. (When known as complete heterochromia, it means one eye is a solid color and the other eye is a different solid color.)Channing Tatum has eyes that are half amber in the inner ring and the outer ring is jade green. This is of interest because Tom Hanks among several others shares this condition. Hanks, as seen clearly inThe Da Vinci Code, has mostly amber eyes with an outer ring of bright jade green. While Hanks often wears blue contacts for whatever reason, as he does in CODE, Tatum does not usually wear contacts.Just so you know the kinds of details that excite me.You cannot afford to miss this flawed work of art. You may not like it, you may even hate it for its hateful attitude toward police. Much if not most of it rings too true for my taste, and I am also sick of these films trying to ride the coattails of post-9-11 events. Even worse when a film, like this one, tries to give you a documentary feel. That can be construed as shameless.",3,The movie of no one,1345852800,"08 25, 2012",2012,4279,"['SON', 'OF', 'NO', 'ONE', 'Dir', 'Dito', 'Montiel', '2011', '95', 'minutes', 'intense', 'chilling', 'mystery', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'written', 'one', 'cop-hating', 'individual', 'further', 'detail', 'must', 'be', 'indicated', 'was', 'first', 'released', 'Russia', 'Can', 'someone', 'PLEASE', 'explain', 'why', 'am', 'seeing', 'good', 'American', 'film', 'shot', 'America', 'American', 'production', 'studio', 'American', 'actors', 'opening', 'weird', 'places', 'Russia', 'Bulgaria', 'Caucasus', 'Mountains', 'Please', 'Officer', 'Jonathan', 'White', 'ultra-hot', 'talented', 'Channing', 'Tatum', 'shell-shocked', 'young', 'cop', 'stuck', 'weird', 'precinct', 'New', 'York', 'where', 'deceased', 'father', 'once', 'served', 'year', '2002', 'city', 'high', 'alert', 'reason', 'now', 'know', 'Jonathan', 'childhood', 'coming', 'back', 'haunt', 'horribly', 'paranormal', 'garbage', 'too', 'real', 'suspect', 'poor', 'masses', 'huddled', 'gigantic', 'drug-plagued', 'projects.Flashbacks', '1986', 'horrible', 'gigantic', 'projects', 'young', 'Jonathan', 'elderly', 'grandmother', 'Living', 'perpetual', 'fear', 'scumbags', 'who', 'plague', 'apartments', 'drug', 'dealers', 'child', 'molesters', 'alike', 'young', 'Jonathan', 'mysteriously', 'hands', 'gun', 'are', 'not', 'told', 'are', 'able', 'guess', 'protection', 'father', 'already', 'killed', 'line', 'duty', 'Jonathan', 'only', 'friend', 'Vinnie', 'originally', 'offered', 'Terence', 'Howard', 'played', 'Tracy', 'Morgan', '.A', 'filthy', 'deranged', 'drug', 'pusher', 'breaks', 'apartment', 'Jonathan', 'shoots', 'head', 'Pure', 'reflex', 'child', 'sad', 'luck', 'expert', 'bull', 'eye', 'Vinnie', 'throw', 'man', 'trash', 'Later', 'Jonathan', 'fending', 'off', 'drug', 'dealer', 'who', 'trying', 'extort', 'Jonathan', 'down', 'stairs', 'kills', 'also', 'gloom', 'mysterious', 'police', 'detective', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'role', 'originally', 'offered', 'Robert', 'De', 'Niro', 'reassure', 'Jonathan', 'whole', 'thing.Thus', 'present', 'Officer', 'Jonathan', 'White', 'live', 'hell-on-earth-precinct', 'unable', 'fathom', 'why', 'been', 'transferred', 'there', 'captain', 'Ray', 'Liotta', 'have', 'love-hate', 'relationship', 'soon', 'mysterious', 'letters', 'begin', 'arrive', 'two', 'unsolved', 'murders', '1986', 'Jonathan', 'can', 'not', 'understand', 'anything', 'able', 'honestly', 'come', 'grips', 'karma.I', 'will', 'not', 'spoil', 'story', 'ultimately', 'mystery', 'who', 'resurrecting', 'past', 'murders', 'why', 'audience', 'will', 'solve', 'mystery', 'fairly', 'quickly', 'nepotism', 'buddy/buddy', 'system', 'force', 'will', 'certainly', 'mystify', 'anyone', 'not', 'intimate', 'also', 'want', 'know', 'brilliant', 'creepy', 'story', 'why', 'was', 'so', 'poorly', 'shot', 'terribly', 'directed', 'Why', 'most', 'dialogue', 'swallowed', 'mumbled', 'else', 'shouted', 'line-over-line', 'other', 'words', 'where', 'pride', 'American', 'film', 'should', 'have', 'see', 'none', 'pride', 'here', 'wonder', 'opened', 'Russia', 'so', 'many', 'films', 'cost', '15', 'million', 'make', 'grossed', 'laughable', '28,000', 'numbers', 'always', 'mean', 'something.Since', 'am', 'anthropologist', 'even', 'when', 'watching', 'film', 'fact', 'created', 'new', 'area', 'study', 'known', 'cinemanthropology', 'must', 'address', 'color', 'Channing', 'eyes', 'Channing', 'share', 'condition', 'known', 'central/sectional', 'heterochromia', 'iridum', 'person', 'more', 'one', 'eye', 'color', 'concentric', 'rings', 'When', 'known', 'complete', 'heterochromia', 'one', 'eye', 'solid', 'color', 'other', 'eye', 'different', 'solid', 'color', 'Channing', 'Tatum', 'eyes', 'are', 'half', 'amber', 'inner', 'ring', 'outer', 'ring', 'jade', 'green', 'interest', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'several', 'others', 'shares', 'condition', 'Hanks', 'seen', 'clearly', 'inThe', 'Da', 'Vinci', 'Code', 'mostly', 'amber', 'eyes', 'outer', 'ring', 'bright', 'jade', 'green', 'Hanks', 'often', 'blue', 'contacts', 'reason', 'CODE', 'Tatum', 'not', 'usually', 'wear', 'contacts.Just', 'so', 'know', 'kinds', 'details', 'excite', 'me.You', 'can', 'not', 'afford', 'miss', 'flawed', 'work', 'art', 'may', 'not', 'like', 'may', 'even', 'hate', 'hateful', 'attitude', 'police', 'Much', 'not', 'most', 'too', 'true', 'taste', 'am', 'also', 'sick', 'films', 'trying', 'ride', 'coattails', 'post-9-11', 'events', 'Even', 'worse', 'when', 'film', 'one', 'give', 'documentary', 'feel', 'can', 'be', 'construed', 'shameless']",N/A

Despite the presence of a heady cast of high profile actors this story just never takes off.  Perhaps that is partially due to the fact that the lead actor role is given to Channing Tatum who though he does show some gradual improvement in learning his acting skills remains a one dimensional character on the screen.To keep it short, the plot can be condensed as follows: rookie cop Jonathan `Milk' White (Channing Tatum) is assigned to the 118 Precinct in the same district where he grew up. The Precinct Captain (Ray Liotta) starts receiving anonymous letters about two unsolved murders that happened many years ago in the housing projects when Jonathan was just a kid. A reporter (Juliette Binouce) sees the letters as evidence for an inside coverup of the two murders from Jonathan's childhood and a detective (Al Pacino) leads the `investigation' with the corroborated intent of coverup of police action.  There are scenes of flashback to when the murders occurred and the perpetrator is indeed Jonathan as a kid (Jake Cherry) whose only friend is young Vinnie (Brian Gilbert) - the victims were abusive junkies but Jonathan has never been able to forget the gruesome facts. We jump back and forth in time: Jonathan is happily married to Kerry (Katie Holmes) and they have a loving daughter with petit mal seizure disorder.  As the investigation proceeds Jonathan fears for his family's safety and for the safety of his old friend Vinnie (now Tracy Morgan). The ending is predictable and far too prolonged.Despite the presence of Binoche, Pacino, Liotta and Holmes (and a group of very talented youngsters who play the leads as children) the story is just too drawn out and predictable and filled with violence to make it work.

This makes sense though, not only does the movie move at rather slow pace, but the story and it's script are such worn out police procedural cliches that it is boring for all involved, the actor's wear it like a make-up effect. Without stars, a movie like this would never get a green light from financial backers, because it is clear that no one would much care to see a movie that's no better than a TV cop show from decades past.Written and directed by Dito Montiel, who previously worked with Tatum on his vastly superior first two moviesA Guide to Recognizing Your SaintsandFighting, the story structure here resembles the former, but without any of the interest or (real) human drama. A first rate cast is on hand mostly to do nothing, completely wasted here are Katie Holmes and Juliette Binoche playing the only women in the story, they get to be angry a lot of the time and yell dull dialogue at Tatum. Ray Liotta, playing a cop for about the millionth time, just when did his career get sidetracked into type casting as the authority type, I swear I saw him as a cop half a dozen times in the last year alone, Liotta gets his lines out and then leaves the movie as often as he can. Tracy Morgan, in a rare dramatic turn, comes off best mostly because he's not bad, he's far from good, but he's not bad. Montiel showed great potential with his earlier efforts, but here he shows signs of already burning out by repeating himself in themes and characters that seemed to have been already used up.Finally a plea to Al Pacino. Pacino, sadly, in recent years seems to have abandoned all dignity as an actor. Now 71 years of age, the Oscar winner and legendary actor, seems to take movies that could never have sounded promising even on the page, the duds are compiling like a string of dominoes, that when they fall I fear could take all or part of his legacy with them. One could never doubt thatThe Godfather Collection (The Coppola Restoration) [Blu-ray] orScarface (Limited Edition) [Blu-ray + Digital Copy] have been canonized as the contemporary masterpieces that they are, but similarly to the way cheapo horror films tarnished the good names of Ray Milland and Joan Crawford before him, films like ""88 Minutes"", ""Righteous Kill"", ""Jack & Jill"", and this one are already taking a huge dent out of his legacy, and younger generations may grow up knowing him only for this kind of drivel.Check out my reviews at [...]",2,No one goes nowhere,1334534400,"04 16, 2012",2012,2615,"['Perhaps', 'given', 'away', 'fact', 'Channing', 'Tatum', 'half', 'asleep', 'whole', 'duration', 'Son', 'No', 'One', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'glorified', 'cameo', 'also', 'tired', 'here', 'sense', 'not', 'only', 'movie', 'move', 'rather', 'slow', 'pace', 'story', 'script', 'are', 'such', 'out', 'police', 'procedural', 'cliches', 'boring', 'involved', 'actor', 'make-up', 'effect', 'stars', 'movie', 'would', 'never', 'get', 'green', 'light', 'financial', 'backers', 'clear', 'one', 'would', 'much', 'care', 'see', 'movie', 'better', 'TV', 'cop', 'show', 'decades', 'past.Written', 'directed', 'Dito', 'Montiel', 'who', 'previously', 'worked', 'Tatum', 'vastly', 'superior', 'first', 'two', 'moviesA', 'Guide', 'Recognizing', 'SaintsandFighting', 'story', 'structure', 'here', 'former', 'interest', 'real', 'human', 'drama', 'first', 'rate', 'cast', 'hand', 'mostly', 'do', 'nothing', 'completely', 'wasted', 'here', 'are', 'Katie', 'Holmes', 'Juliette', 'Binoche', 'playing', 'only', 'women', 'story', 'get', 'be', 'angry', 'lot', 'time', 'yell', 'dull', 'dialogue', 'Tatum', 'Ray', 'Liotta', 'playing', 'cop', 'millionth', 'time', 'just', 'when', 'did', 'career', 'get', 'sidetracked', 'type', 'casting', 'authority', 'type', 'swear', 'saw', 'cop', 'dozen', 'times', 'last', 'year', 'alone', 'Liotta', 'lines', 'out', 'then', 'movie', 'as', 'often', 'can', 'Tracy', 'Morgan', 'rare', 'dramatic', 'turn', 'off', 'best', 'mostly', 'not', 'bad', 'far', 'good', 'not', 'bad', 'Montiel', 'showed', 'great', 'potential', 'earlier', 'efforts', 'here', 'signs', 'already', 'burning', 'out', 'repeating', 'themes', 'characters', 'seemed', 'have', 'been', 'already', 'used', 'up.Finally', 'plea', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'Pacino', 'sadly', 'recent', 'years', 'have', 'abandoned', 'dignity', 'actor', 'Now', '71', 'years', 'age', 'Oscar', 'winner', 'legendary', 'actor', 'take', 'movies', 'could', 'never', 'have', 'sounded', 'promising', 'even', 'page', 'duds', 'are', 'compiling', 'string', 'dominoes', 'when', 'fall', 'fear', 'could', 'take', 'part', 'legacy', 'One', 'could', 'never', 'doubt', 'thatThe', 'Godfather', 'Collection', 'Coppola', 'Restoration', '[', 'Blu-ray', ']', 'orScarface', 'Limited', 'Edition', '[', 'Blu-ray', '+', 'Digital', 'Copy', ']', 'have', 'been', 'canonized', 'contemporary', 'masterpieces', 'are', 'similarly', 'way', 'cheapo', 'horror', 'films', 'tarnished', 'good', 'names', 'Ray', 'Milland', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'films', '88', 'Minutes', 'Righteous', 'Kill', 'Jack', 'Jill', 'one', 'are', 'already', 'taking', 'huge', 'dent', 'legacy', 'younger', 'generations', 'may', 'grow', 'up', 'knowing', 'only', 'kind', 'drivel.Check', 'reviews', '[', ']']",N/A

It is 2002, the aftermath of 9-11 is going on, and acts as a symbol of Jonathan's life. The movie flashes back to 1986 when Jonathan lived in the Queensboro projects with his grandmother. He was harassed by a thug, who he shot and killed.  The body was dumped in the garbage, the crime was never solved.  A lot of people knew ""Milk"" did it. The people in the projects hate the cops.Now in 2002, Jonathan lives with his wife Katie Holmes and a daughter with a medical condition. She is one of those adorable kids that make you want to run out and have a dozen or so.  There is a push to clean up the district, making it safe. There is an anonymous person who places articles about TWO unsolved murders from 1986, a reminder to Jonathan.  The projects is still an asylum and the cops have better things to do than to dig up a 16 year old case (the movie claims 14 years, but do the math.)Al Pacino plays Officer Charlie who was investigating the case in 1986. Ray Liotta plays Captain Marion Mathers , Jonathan's boss. Jonathan was the son of a police officer, one that was the partner of Officer Charlie.As the movie progresses we get more pieces of the puzzle and the harassment becomes more intense. We are drawn into it. We want to know, ""Who is the snitch?"" ""Why are they doing this?"" ""Who else knows?""  The snitch part is fairly easy to figure out.This isn't Pacino's finest film. This isn't the best cop drama around. The acting was decent, the script had a certain amount of predictability. Katie Holmes was great for the short time she was on the screen.

The plot had so many holes in it that it was a constant series of &#34;lets overlook this stupid part&#34; in the hope that the movie would become better. A young friend of Tatum's character is clearly so emotionally tormented (being in and out of mental hospitals) that no one in their right mind would care what he had to say concerning an alleged murder 16 years prior, EVEN IF he was the one writing letters. In the beginning we see the girl was in on the disaster, but it never occurs to anyone to ask her if she is writing these letters.I mean sending letters to a newspaper making unsubstantiated claims about a murder committed 16 years previously would go in the trash, not make headlines. The cops would be the first people to recognize this, but instead this poor piece of direction has police captains, etc. arranging murders through a kind of blackmail. There were other instances of sloppy direction, in which a woman assaults a guy and Tatum and his partner throw the two of them into the back seat of the cop car unhandcuffed.",1,Annoying,1388620800,"01 2, 2014",2014,1143,"['One', 'look', 'actors', 'had', 'rent', 'How', 'can', 'so', 'much', 'talent', 'be', 'wasted', 'question', 'plot', 'had', 'so', 'many', 'holes', 'was', 'constant', 'series', '34', 'lets', 'overlook', 'stupid', 'part', '34', 'hope', 'movie', 'would', 'become', 'better', 'young', 'friend', 'Tatum', 'character', 'clearly', 'so', 'emotionally', 'tormented', 'being', 'mental', 'hospitals', 'one', 'right', 'mind', 'would', 'care', 'what', 'had', 'say', 'concerning', 'alleged', 'murder', '16', 'years', 'prior', 'EVEN', 'IF', 'was', 'one', 'writing', 'letters', 'beginning', 'see', 'girl', 'was', 'disaster', 'never', 'anyone', 'ask', 'writing', 'letters.I', 'mean', 'sending', 'letters', 'newspaper', 'making', 'unsubstantiated', 'claims', 'murder', 'committed', '16', 'years', 'previously', 'would', 'go', 'trash', 'not', 'make', 'headlines', 'cops', 'would', 'be', 'first', 'people', 'recognize', 'instead', 'poor', 'piece', 'direction', 'police', 'captains', 'etc', 'arranging', 'murders', 'kind', 'blackmail', 'were', 'other', 'instances', 'sloppy', 'direction', 'woman', 'guy', 'Tatum', 'partner', 'throw', 'two', 'back', 'seat', 'cop', 'car', 'unhandcuffed']",N/A

When rookie officer Jonathan White (Tatum) is assigned to the precinct where he grew up letters start showing up that mention two unsolved murders. When the letters remind White of his past he is stuck between trying to uncover who is sending them and covering up his involvement. I am a huge Pacino fan and that is the reason I wanted to watch this. The trailer looked OK but anything with him I will watch. He was great in this. That about it. The movie was very slow and had a 5 minute idea that they kept repeating over and over until you either struggle through or end up finishing just to see the ending. I will admit that the last ten minutes makes it worth watching, but getting to that part is a real struggle. Any scene without Pacino or Liotta lacks emotion and you have a hard time caring for White at all. Tracy Morgan is actually not bad in a dramatic performance but overall this is one of the biggest disappointments of the year. I give it a C-.",2,"Pacino is the best part of this movie.  Writing, idea, story and overall movie are very disapointing.
