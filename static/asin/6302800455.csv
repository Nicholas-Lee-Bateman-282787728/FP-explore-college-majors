Webber,"[0, 0]",i chose five stars because this is a true story.i liked this movie because it was a bout a young girl in some type of care facility for special needs children who was encouraged to write to Elvis and whom Elvis took it upon himself to not only write back once but twice and also send her a huge Teddy Bear at Christmas.i would recommend this movie not only to people who loved and admired Elvis but to all those who are looking for a wonderful family movie to enjoy.,5,true story,1367107200,"04 28, 2013",2013,466,"['i', 'chose', 'five', 'stars', 'true', 'story.i', 'liked', 'movie', 'was', 'bout', 'young', 'girl', 'type', 'care', 'facility', 'special', 'needs', 'children', 'who', 'was', 'encouraged', 'write', 'Elvis', 'whom', 'Elvis', 'took', 'not', 'only', 'write', 'back', 'once', 'twice', 'also', 'send', 'huge', 'Teddy', 'Bear', 'Christmas.i', 'would', 'recommend', 'movie', 'not', 'only', 'people', 'who', 'loved', 'admired', 'Elvis', 'who', 'are', 'looking', 'wonderful', 'family', 'movie', 'enjoy']",N/A

With an amazing picturesque (Canada?) setting, a deeply moving story and stellar acting, you cannot go wrong wth this one. I love Diane Lane now, and she is terrific in this, portraying the main character of Karen, Cerebal Palsy sufferer. You don't need to be an Elvis fan to like this movie either, it was his caring and compassion towards her that moved me more than anything, and I just felt so angry to think that this wonderful, brave young lady had been so totally abandoned by her family (or so it is alluded to, at any rate). The movie has a wonderful, langorous feel about it, the way that movies used to be made - nice slow build-up, with good dialogue and sumptious, lingering photography (unlike the horrible fast camera work, special effects packed, oh so try hard movies of today). I love simple stories (wish Hollywood would go back to basics), and from start to finish this movie is absorbing and deeply satisfying, if sad. My four year old son just loved it too.Highly recommended.",4,THIS MOVIE TOUCHED ME!,1094083200,"09 2, 2004",2004,1103,"['Well', 'paying', 'only', 'four', 'dollars', 'movie', 'having', 'watched', 'know', 'what', 'bargain', 'got', 'amazing', 'picturesque', 'Canada', 'setting', 'deeply', 'moving', 'story', 'stellar', 'acting', 'can', 'not', 'go', 'wrong', 'wth', 'one', 'love', 'Diane', 'Lane', 'now', 'terrific', 'portraying', 'main', 'character', 'Karen', 'Cerebal', 'Palsy', 'sufferer', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'be', 'Elvis', 'fan', 'like', 'movie', 'either', 'was', 'caring', 'compassion', 'towards', 'moved', 'more', 'anything', 'just', 'felt', 'so', 'angry', 'think', 'wonderful', 'brave', 'young', 'lady', 'had', 'been', 'so', 'totally', 'abandoned', 'family', 'so', 'alluded', 'rate', 'movie', 'wonderful', 'langorous', 'feel', 'way', 'movies', 'used', 'be', 'made', 'nice', 'slow', 'build-up', 'good', 'dialogue', 'sumptious', 'lingering', 'photography', 'horrible', 'fast', 'camera', 'work', 'special', 'effects', 'packed', 'oh', 'so', 'try', 'hard', 'movies', 'today', 'love', 'simple', 'stories', 'wish', 'Hollywood', 'would', 'go', 'back', 'basics', 'start', 'finish', 'movie', 'absorbing', 'deeply', 'satisfying', 'sad', 'four', 'year', 'old', 'son', 'just', 'loved', 'too.Highly', 'recommended']",N/A
