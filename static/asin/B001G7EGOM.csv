1193524,A35XUI9HGMAJEX,B001G7EGOM,Carlisle Wheeling,"[0, 0]","I really enjoyed this hour-long documentary on the making of D2's Rio and the interviews with both most of the band members and several of their friends and colleagues.  The best part was watching the breakdown of the tracks behind the mixing board and hearing each individual part.  You really got a good idea how the creative process came about, and how the members fed off each other creatively.  There is also some history on how the band got started due to John and Nick's virtually life-long friendship, and there is plenty here about shooting those still outstanding videos that made them a household name.  This documentary only goes to prove how wrong critics and certain other people were in labeling them as lightweight contenders who would never be remembered 5 years down the road.  Well, Rio is now 30 years old, and even a new generation of fans is being born as we speak.  It appears to me that D2 has that staying power after all, and for good reason.  They had, and still have, plenty of talent, and Rio is simply a magical album that deserves its place in rock history along with anything their contemporaries and their classic influences have laid down.  It's long past time to give these guys their due, and they all seem to have grown up a lot since the petty things that drove them apart when they were younger.  Too bad Andy was not present for any of it.  I would have loved to get some input from him, but he's off doing his Tina Louise-like disassociating bit again.  His loss, I guess.  Well, let this be your gain.  This DVD is worth your time, and it will make you appreciate Rio even more than you did before.",5,Great Overview of D2's Best Known Album.,1328400000,"02 5, 2012",2012,1640,"['really', 'enjoyed', 'hour-long', 'documentary', 'making', 'D2', 'Rio', 'interviews', 'most', 'band', 'members', 'several', 'friends', 'colleagues', 'best', 'part', 'was', 'watching', 'breakdown', 'tracks', 'mixing', 'board', 'hearing', 'individual', 'part', 'really', 'got', 'good', 'idea', 'how', 'creative', 'process', 'came', 'about', 'how', 'members', 'fed', 'off', 'other', 'creatively', 'also', 'history', 'how', 'band', 'got', 'started', 'due', 'John', 'Nick', 'virtually', 'life-long', 'friendship', 'plenty', 'here', 'shooting', 'still', 'outstanding', 'videos', 'made', 'household', 'name', 'documentary', 'only', 'prove', 'how', 'wrong', 'critics', 'certain', 'other', 'people', 'were', 'labeling', 'lightweight', 'contenders', 'who', 'would', 'never', 'be', 'remembered', '5', 'years', 'road', 'Well', 'Rio', 'now', '30', 'years', 'old', 'even', 'new', 'generation', 'fans', 'being', 'born', 'speak', 'D2', 'staying', 'power', 'good', 'reason', 'had', 'still', 'have', 'plenty', 'talent', 'Rio', 'simply', 'magical', 'album', 'place', 'rock', 'history', 'anything', 'contemporaries', 'classic', 'influences', 'have', 'laid', 'down', 'long', 'past', 'time', 'give', 'guys', 'due', 'seem', 'have', 'grown', 'up', 'lot', 'petty', 'things', 'drove', 'apart', 'when', 'were', 'younger', 'Too', 'bad', 'Andy', 'was', 'not', 'present', 'would', 'have', 'loved', 'get', 'input', 'off', 'doing', 'Tina', 'Louise-like', 'disassociating', 'bit', 'again', 'loss', 'guess', 'Well', 'let', 'be', 'gain', 'DVD', 'time', 'will', 'make', 'appreciate', 'Rio', 'even', 'more', 'did', 'before']",N/A

It's got fantastic hits we all know (Rio, Hungry Like the Wolf, Save a Prayer) a few awesome album cuts that could have easily been hits (Hold Back the Rain, My Own Way, Last Chance on the Stairway) and some arty, darker songs that showed just how talented these guys were (the Chauffeur, New Religion). It might be too good-there was no way they'd ever top it.The extras are fantastic--the original U.S. releases are still my favorites, as I grew up with them, and prefer them to the UK versions. The b-sides are all great.The only downside is that it's the only reissue that didn't come with videos and live concert footage, but there's no shortage of that elsewhere. A wonderful album and package.
