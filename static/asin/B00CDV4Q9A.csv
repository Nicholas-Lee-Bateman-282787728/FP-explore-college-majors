1646124,AZAEJB1ECT9HC,B00CDV4Q9A,Gary P. Cohen,"[9, 10]","Dr, Kildare and Ben Casey both premiered the same year and were both smash hits. (They were cancelled the same year as well.)  I remember watching both series with my father and mother.  I always preferred Kildare.  Ben Casey was a neurosurgeon and a large percentage of his patients suffered from brain tumors and the like.  It could be a depressing show, as many of his patients wouldn't last the hour.  Kildare, on the other hand, had his share of successes.  Many of his patients came through fine.  (I do remember a tear-jerking episode whose title escapes me, that guest starred Martin Balsam as a dying man concerned about what would happen to his mentally retarded brother, (played by Sorrell Booke,)when he passes away.  Kildare gets involved and helps him.  I do not remember what season this episode was from but it is still very memorable to me.  I do remember that all of us watching at the time were in tears by the end of the show.)Anyway, Richard Chamberlain and Raymond Massey were both excellent as Kildare and his mentor, Dr. Gillespie.  I met Chamberlain at a movie memorabilia show a couple of years ago and asked him when Kildare would be coming out on DVD.  He didn't know then, but we all know now.

1646129,A3VB9QX45AIKQP,B00CDV4Q9A,Judith D. Crocker,"[27, 28]","Dr. Kildare was not simply my favorite movie from the sixties, but of ALL time. Many years ago, an elderly fan passed away, and I received her boxes of 6 mm films, that she had taped from the Dr. Kildare programs. The Richard Chamberlain fan club wanted to see Dr. Kildare, and we tried to find out if the series would ever be released, but at the time it seemed impossible. My daughter made some DVD's of the programs that weren't too fuzzy to watch, but no matter how hard we tried, most of the programs were not enjoyable because the film was so old. Nevertheless, they got an idea, of just how fabulous, Richard Chamberlain and Raymond Massey were as Dr. Kildare and his mentor, Dr. Gillespie. We all hoped that someday, the original programs would be released. My Dream Came True. I have been staying up late enjoying these wonderful, newly released packages. I just wanted to cry, when I saw how clear and beautiful the picture is, and the voice is equally clear and enjoyable. I felt like a teenager once more, as I went back in time, and entered the world of Dr. Kildare and the drama at Blair General Hospital. Richard Chamberlain is now 79 years old, and is still gorgeous. All men should age so well. I have had numerous letters from Richard Chamberlain over the years, and he is also, the world's nicest actor. I even got a phone call from him, when he was in Portland doing a television project several years ago. He is friendly, down to earth, and it was unbelievable to me, that he would take time to call. After all, I am ONLY his oldest, and most fervent fan. Lol! Dr. Kildare was sensational. Richard Chamberlain was perfect in that role. He had the diction, presence, and humility, to make the Kildare character believable and lovable. Kildare was a huge sensation in The United Kingdom also. The royals planned their Thursday evening schedules around Dr. Kildare. Princess Margaret had a crush on him, and invited him to a party once when he lived in England. The subject matter of Dr. Kildare transcends time. It amazingly relates to the issues we face today, and I learn valuable lessons and information from each program. I laugh out loud, when the old sixties ambulance comes wheeling into the Emergency lot. Like many of you, I wish the physicians of today, were as sensitive and caring as Dr. Kildare. It doesn't hurt that Richard Chamberlain is also a most beautiful man physically. I would love to know how he feels watching himself as a young, and relatively new actor. He can be very proud. Despite all his fears, and inexperience, he masterfully created a most beloved character, in Dr. James Kildare. This role catapulted him to fame. He spent some time in England, studying acting, and trying a variety of venues. When he decided to come home, we were all waiting with open arms. Some of his most beloved roles are Captain John Blackthorne (Angie San) in Shogun, and Father Ralph de Briccasart in The Thornbirds. I loved him in All The Winters That Have Been, and Murder By Phone. Murder was a bit far out as a film, but loved the character he portrayed of Dr. Nat Bridger, University Professor, turned sleuth. I thought the role of detective, suited him well, and wish he would have pursued such a character in a television series. If you have fond memories of Dr. Kildare from the sixties, you will not be disappointed in this First Season package. If you would like to experience a thrilling television program from the sixties ... you will love Dr. Kildare. I hope the Warner Archives will release the entire five years of Dr. Kildare.

Dr. Leonard Gillespie (Raymond Massey) was the senior doctor at the hospital, and who, Kildare tried to win the respect of.While Dr. Kildare was fantastic to watch, Kildare was your everyday intern who was naturally attracted to the opposite sex, where Ben Casey was a doctor's doctor, out-spoken and never suffered fools lightly.While learning his profession, Dr. Kildare had to deal with the mundane things of life, some irate and vicious patients, a doctor who wanted to be a missionary and mental patients among the many other people doctor's have to deal with.There is a young Peter Falk, who wore a doctor's uniform before he chose to wear a trench-coat, which is not very unusual as many great actors started their careers on shows like these. Even Bill Bixby, Paul Burke, Ken Berry, Suzanne Pleshette, Eileen Heckart and Carolyn Jones spent some time, as well as others, on the series.The best show of this series, I think, was ""Operation Lazarus"", where doctors Kildare and Gillespie were involved in a study to reabilitate mentally ill patients. It is a subject that many people don't like to talk about, but this story is sad in some respects and also moving at the end when the chosen patients were reunited with loved ones, all because of a new drug being tested.This first series has ten shows on 2 dvds and I recommend this show for anyone intrested in the old medical dramas, and hope you will not be disappointed.

The medical technology seems almost stone aged now. The people are not wooden they appear fully fleshed out just a bit over the time at times. I won't give spoilers here.  the quality of the transfer is generally very good.  Not much hiss and the video quality is good.  You can hear what each character is saying but you mighht have to turn the volume up.  Seems some of the episodes were recorded at a low volume.  Each volume contains a good number of episodes so you are getting your money's worth there.  So many people complain that they divide these old show seasons up into 2 volumes to make more money.  What some people do not know or do not care to remember is that in the olden days when I was young and these shows were new the TV season could have 60 episodes if it was a hit show.  Production values were not that high and money flowed like water since the big three networks were the only games it town back then.  The return on investment of a hit show was pretty much guranteed.Dr Kildare was a great show.
