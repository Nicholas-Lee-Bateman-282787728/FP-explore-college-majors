72505,A1DTCJV6KOMJOA,078401003X,A*,"[2, 3]","The Crying Game is one of those rare perfect films. From the begining the driving factor behind the plot is human behavior; refrences are made abundant, rather Whitaker's kidnapped character is talking to his kidnappers about the fact that he knows he has to die for their cause or when Rhea's character decides to fulfill Whitaker's character's dying wish and look after his girlfriend (Davidson). When all is said and done the plot takes u on so many twist and turns through; love, deceit, politics, hatred, racism and even murder. The Crying Game, leaves you breathless and wondering how a film with so many twists and turns never once drops the ball, confuses you or even disappoints in any of it's subplots!! This film has the privalage of being one of the only modern day flicks with a true sense of atmosphere! The lighting is always a notch toned down and the mood is sultry and full of such a thick air of lust that you can cut it with a knife! This film was robbed at the '92 oscar's and it's a shame. Rhea and Davidson deserved to walk away with the prizes for their roles a tortured and deconstructed couple. This is one of the best films ever made and it deserves to be in your collection any film that can get it's point across without tearing down your emotions with blatant symbolism is brilliant in its honesty and interpertaion of life and that is what The Crying Game is about!",5,One of The Best!,994550400,"07 8, 2001",2001,1396,"['Crying', 'Game', 'one', 'rare', 'perfect', 'films', 'begining', 'driving', 'factor', 'plot', 'human', 'behavior', 'refrences', 'are', 'made', 'abundant', 'rather', 'Whitaker', 'kidnapped', 'character', 'talking', 'kidnappers', 'fact', 'die', 'cause', 'when', 'Rhea', 'character', 'fulfill', 'Whitaker', 'character', 'dying', 'wish', 'look', 'girlfriend', 'Davidson', 'When', 'said', 'done', 'plot', 'u', 'so', 'many', 'twist', 'through', 'love', 'deceit', 'politics', 'hatred', 'racism', 'even', 'murder', 'Crying', 'Game', 'breathless', 'wondering', 'how', 'film', 'so', 'many', 'twists', 'never', 'once', 'ball', 'even', 'disappoints', 'subplots', 'film', 'privalage', 'being', 'one', 'only', 'modern', 'day', 'flicks', 'true', 'sense', 'atmosphere', 'lighting', 'always', 'notch', 'toned', 'down', 'mood', 'sultry', 'full', 'such', 'thick', 'air', 'lust', 'can', 'cut', 'knife', 'film', 'was', 'robbed', ""'92"", 'oscar', 'shame', 'Rhea', 'Davidson', 'deserved', 'walk', 'away', 'prizes', 'roles', 'tortured', 'deconstructed', 'couple', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'ever', 'made', 'be', 'collection', 'film', 'can', 'get', 'point', 'tearing', 'down', 'emotions', 'blatant', 'symbolism', 'brilliant', 'honesty', 'interpertaion', 'life', 'what', 'Crying', 'Game', 'about']",N/A
72506,A319Y83RT0MRVR,078401003X,AIROLF,"[0, 0]","It was sometime in the late '90s that I saw about 3 minutes of this movie. I turned my TV on and this notable film was on. I happened to turn off the TV the moment I saw the scene where one of the main characters throws out a bowl with two goldfish in it from the third-story window and the poor fish crash to their death. The scene has a very profound affect on me and I never wanted to actually watch the film until very recently. The Crying Game is such a staple of our culture, of the way transgender issues were introduced into Hollywood, that plenty of other movies evoke it (e.g., in one of my favorite movies of all time,Playing By Heart, one of the supporting characters says, ""I Don't want there to be a Crying Game confusion). After resisting this film for at least a decade, I had to finally see what the fuss was about. I can't say I'm disappointed or shocked, especially by ""the reveal."" I have found the introduction very powerful and Forrest Whittaker, while on screen for a sheer 20 minutes or so, is highly effective in his performance. His performance shadows and carries the poignancy of the rest of the movie. The scenes are shot beautifully and the storytelling is quite different from what you'll find in current cinema.",4,a monumental film that's hard to categorize,1272067200,"04 24, 2010",2010,1243,"['was', 'sometime', 'late', ""'90s"", 'saw', '3', 'minutes', 'movie', 'turned', 'TV', 'notable', 'film', 'was', 'happened', 'turn', 'off', 'TV', 'moment', 'saw', 'scene', 'where', 'one', 'main', 'characters', 'out', 'bowl', 'two', 'goldfish', 'third-story', 'window', 'poor', 'fish', 'crash', 'death', 'scene', 'very', 'profound', 'affect', 'never', 'wanted', 'actually', 'watch', 'film', 'very', 'recently', 'Crying', 'Game', 'such', 'staple', 'culture', 'way', 'transgender', 'issues', 'were', 'introduced', 'Hollywood', 'plenty', 'other', 'movies', 'evoke', 'e.g.', 'one', 'favorite', 'movies', 'time', 'Playing', 'Heart', 'one', 'supporting', 'characters', 'Do', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'Crying', 'Game', 'confusion', 'resisting', 'film', 'least', 'decade', 'had', 'finally', 'see', 'what', 'fuss', 'was', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', ""'m"", 'disappointed', 'shocked', 'especially', 'reveal', 'have', 'found', 'introduction', 'very', 'powerful', 'Forrest', 'Whittaker', 'screen', 'sheer', '20', 'minutes', 'so', 'highly', 'effective', 'performance', 'performance', 'shadows', 'poignancy', 'rest', 'movie', 'scenes', 'are', 'shot', 'beautifully', 'storytelling', 'quite', 'different', 'what', ""'ll"", 'find', 'current', 'cinema']",N/A

I was completely blindsided, and while I knew the big reveal because of internet spoilers, I must say that it adds a whole new dimension to the film when you see how it plays out.I don't really want to give too much away here, for the brilliance of this film comes in the mysterious way in which it all comes together.I'll try my hand at this.The film opens with a rather hurried and chaotic sequence that lands a British soldier named Jody in the custody of the Irish Republic.  They are holding him prisoner in ransom for one of their men, and they plan on killing him if their demands are not met.  Over the course of his imprisonment, he is cared after by Fergus, a man who is obviously struggling with his role in all of this.  The two men form a bond that is severed when Fergus is told to kill Jody.  What happens next proves to be an eye opening (and life altering) event for Fergus, moving him to seek out Jody's girlfriend, Dil, and attempt to, in a way, live his life for him.  When Fergus's partner in crime, Jude, finds herself back in Fergus's life though, things get even more complicated.What appears on the outset to be a thriller of sorts breaks itself down rather quickly into a character driven piece that rests solely on the shoulders of the incredible cast to create, and sustain, a connective tissue between these people.  The bond that forms between Jody and Fergus is remarkably grounded, even if it only lasts about thirty minutes tops.  The tension that arises between Fergus and Jude is so thick you could cut it with a knife, and the budding love between Fergus and Dil is remarkably believable, down to the last `awkward' detail.""Details baby, details.""And that is what this film is all about, subtle yet poignant details.  The actors understood that (can I get a round of applause for Forest Whitaker, Miranda Richardson, Stephen Rea and Jaye Davidson please) and so did Neal Jordon, who wrote and directed this surprising gem of a film.  The script is phenomenally crafted to be as genuine and as complex as possible without ever losing one to the other.  It is told in a straightforward motion, but it never loses the ambiguity needed to keep you holding your breath.I hope that this review doesn't give away too much (I was careful) but I hope that it moves you to see this movie.  This is a truly remarkable film, from start to finish, a film that exposes the secrets that lie within human nature and serves as one of the better character studies I've seen in a long time.",5,"""As the man said, it's in my nature.""",1279065600,"07 14, 2010",2010,2628,"['have', 'yet', 'see', 'Crying', 'Game', 'think', 'know', 'what', 'film', 'promise', 'do', ""n't"", 'was', 'completely', 'blindsided', 'knew', 'big', 'reveal', 'internet', 'spoilers', 'must', 'say', 'whole', 'new', 'dimension', 'film', 'when', 'see', 'how', 'out.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'want', 'give', 'too', 'much', 'away', 'here', 'brilliance', 'film', 'mysterious', 'way', 'together.I', ""'ll"", 'try', 'hand', 'this.The', 'film', 'rather', 'hurried', 'chaotic', 'sequence', 'British', 'soldier', 'named', 'Jody', 'custody', 'Irish', 'Republic', 'are', 'holding', 'prisoner', 'ransom', 'one', 'men', 'plan', 'killing', 'demands', 'are', 'not', 'met', 'course', 'imprisonment', 'cared', 'Fergus', 'man', 'who', 'obviously', 'struggling', 'role', 'two', 'men', 'form', 'bond', 'severed', 'when', 'Fergus', 'told', 'kill', 'Jody', 'What', 'next', 'proves', 'be', 'eye', 'opening', 'life', 'altering', 'event', 'Fergus', 'moving', 'seek', 'out', 'Jody', 'girlfriend', 'Dil', 'attempt', 'way', 'live', 'life', 'When', 'Fergus', 'partner', 'crime', 'Jude', 'back', 'Fergus', 'life', 'things', 'get', 'even', 'more', 'complicated.What', 'outset', 'be', 'thriller', 'sorts', 'breaks', 'down', 'rather', 'quickly', 'character', 'driven', 'piece', 'solely', 'shoulders', 'incredible', 'cast', 'create', 'sustain', 'connective', 'tissue', 'people', 'bond', 'Jody', 'Fergus', 'remarkably', 'grounded', 'even', 'only', 'thirty', 'minutes', 'tops', 'tension', 'Fergus', 'Jude', 'so', 'thick', 'could', 'cut', 'knife', 'budding', 'love', 'Fergus', 'Dil', 'remarkably', 'believable', 'down', 'last', 'awkward', 'detail', 'Details', 'baby', 'details', 'what', 'film', 'subtle', 'yet', 'poignant', 'details', 'actors', 'understood', 'can', 'get', 'round', 'applause', 'Forest', 'Whitaker', 'Miranda', 'Richardson', 'Stephen', 'Rea', 'Jaye', 'Davidson', 'please', 'so', 'did', 'Neal', 'Jordon', 'who', 'wrote', 'directed', 'surprising', 'gem', 'film', 'script', 'phenomenally', 'crafted', 'be', 'genuine', 'as', 'complex', 'possible', 'ever', 'losing', 'one', 'other', 'told', 'straightforward', 'motion', 'never', 'ambiguity', 'needed', 'keep', 'holding', 'breath.I', 'hope', 'review', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'too', 'much', 'was', 'careful', 'hope', 'see', 'movie', 'truly', 'remarkable', 'film', 'start', 'finish', 'film', 'secrets', 'lie', 'human', 'nature', 'one', 'better', 'character', 'studies', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'long', 'time']",N/A

The story end with the revolver kill of two escaped kidnapper(bad ones) by the victim's girlfriend whom use the weapon that is from the moderate bad guy. He was jailed for killing the woman whom the victim's girlfriend shot her to die and asked her to get way from the murder scene.

Then, the second half was a lot better with, unfortunately, some bad acting. Finally, the final third of the film reverted back to another boredom and maybe hopefully for a more quality viewing but failed at it. So, basically, The Crying Game has one thing going for per se, which is the delicious, awe-inspiring twist.

To be honest, just like his character Jimmy, I really didn't know the shocking secret until it was ""revealed.""  All I kept thinking up until then that Dil (Jaye Davidson) had an very strange low voice.For the few moments Forest Whitaker is in the film, his impact on the rest of the story is like the proverbial pebble ripple in a pond, and for that he should be commended for a job well done.  The problem with the story lies in the fact that not enough emphasis is put on the IRA and too much on a confusing love story, if it's a love story at all.  Once Jimmy finds out the truth about Dil, he seems contrastingly drawn to her and repulsed by her at turns.  Dil seems very manipulative to me, constantly tossing terms of endearment at him that he tosses back, yet he refuses to stay away from her.  Also, there was nothing original about the frog and scorpion story as I've heard that one for years, but the story itself is quite original.On the upside, this movie is quite suspenseful and will keep you riveted to the last.  The performances by the cast are very well done, but you end up asking more questions than the storyline answers.  I suppose this is really the point of it all, leading one to wonder if there's any point at all.  I will say that I felt like smacking Miranda Richardson's character a good one because she was a major bee-otch!  All in all, not a bad movie, but nothing to rave excessively about either.

However, (as much as I hate to say it) 'THE CRYING GAME', might well be one of my all time favorite movies. This movie relies on simply an awesome story, and acting, that will take ones breath away (in more ways than one). I believe this movie should be required viewing for any acting class, or any student of acting looking to broaden their skills, outside the contemporary norms. I truly believe the only reason JAYE DAVIDSON (who I would say played one of the most convincing and moving roles ive ever seen)didn't win the OSCAR was due to the fact that he embarassed the judges who pick the winners to this yearly Hollywood farce; in that he a virtual unknown, could come out of no where, and put on a performance that shook almost every person that watched the movie. Its funny, the hard part about talking about this movie is found in not wanting to give the ""SPOILER"" to those that havent seen it (thus I will wrap this up). The Collector's Edition is a gem, for in it we the many fans (and you know who you are) get to see the alternate ending we really wanted (well at least the one I wanted haha). Yet, after some consideration, I was left to understand (sadly) that Neil Jordan got it right the first time. So if you're like me and you've seen the 'GAME' more than once, or was left with a feeling of disappointment at the ending of the movie, check the COLLECTOR'S EDITION just to see what could have been. And to those who haven't seen it, if you are looking for a movie that will challenge everything you've ever believed in regards to love, sexuality, and the inner beauty of what makes us who and what we are, or simply want to see some of the most memorable acting that has ever graced the silver screen, make it a point to rent or buy this movie ASAP.",5,THE ENDING WE ALL WANTED!!!!,1107043200,"01 30, 2005",2005,2019,"['Let', 'start', 'saying', 'am', 'guy', 'action', 'horror', 'sci-fi', 'explosion', 'special', 'affect', 'mindless', 'rollercoaster', 'ride', 'types', 'movies', 'have', 'always', 'had', 'sexist', 'narrow', 'minded', 'ignorant', 'views', 'concerning', 'Romantic', 'Chick', 'Flicks', 'However', 'as', 'much', 'hate', 'say', 'CRYING', 'GAME', 'might', 'well', 'be', 'one', 'time', 'favorite', 'movies', 'movie', 'simply', 'awesome', 'story', 'acting', 'will', 'take', 'ones', 'breath', 'away', 'more', 'ways', 'one', 'believe', 'movie', 'should', 'be', 'required', 'viewing', 'acting', 'class', 'student', 'acting', 'looking', 'broaden', 'skills', 'contemporary', 'norms', 'truly', 'believe', 'only', 'reason', 'JAYE', 'DAVIDSON', 'who', 'would', 'say', 'played', 'one', 'most', 'convincing', 'moving', 'roles', 'ive', 'ever', 'seen', 'did', ""n't"", 'win', 'OSCAR', 'was', 'due', 'fact', 'embarassed', 'judges', 'who', 'pick', 'winners', 'yearly', 'Hollywood', 'farce', 'virtual', 'unknown', 'could', 'come', 'where', 'put', 'performance', 'shook', 'almost', 'person', 'watched', 'movie', 'funny', 'hard', 'part', 'talking', 'movie', 'found', 'not', 'wanting', 'give', 'SPOILER', 'havent', 'seen', 'thus', 'will', 'wrap', 'up', 'Collector', 'Edition', 'gem', 'many', 'fans', 'know', 'who', 'are', 'get', 'see', 'alternate', 'ending', 'really', 'wanted', 'well', 'least', 'one', 'wanted', 'haha', 'consideration', 'was', 'left', 'understand', 'sadly', 'Neil', 'Jordan', 'got', 'right', 'first', 'time', 'So', ""'re"", ""'ve"", 'seen', ""'GAME"", 'more', 'once', 'was', 'left', 'feeling', 'disappointment', 'ending', 'movie', 'check', 'COLLECTOR', 'EDITION', 'just', 'see', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'are', 'looking', 'movie', 'will', 'challenge', 'everything', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'believed', 'regards', 'love', 'sexuality', 'inner', 'beauty', 'what', 'who', 'what', 'are', 'simply', 'want', 'see', 'most', 'memorable', 'acting', 'ever', 'graced', 'silver', 'screen', 'make', 'point', 'rent', 'buy', 'movie', 'ASAP']",N/A

The viewer is unsure where it all steers at and the famous revelation of Dil's secret is only one point in the story, although it puts a lot of pepper in. Sometimes you will find that certain viewers tend to be disgusted by even a mention of that being possible, but it seems some of them were quite enchanted by the beautiful Dil until then.In general, the cast is doing a very good job and makes it easy to relate to the characters, what, in a story like that, is probably more difficult than it looks like.

Taylor ""GFT""","[1, 1]","Few films have so consistently defeated expectations, both on and off the screen, as Neil Jordan's 1992 THE CRYING GAME, a dark and darkly humorous tale of terrorism, guilt, revenge, and the vagracies of the human heart.  Producers disliked the script, which they considered both uncommercial and impossible to cast.  Filmed on a shoestring budget, it was expected to go nowhere fast--and then became the most talked-about film of its year, alternately fascinating and outrageing audiences and critics around the world, nominated for and winning numerous awards, and going on to become one of the top grossing films of its year.The film is extremely difficult to discuss because to do so undermines its power for a first-time viewer.  In a general sense, it concerns IRA terrorist Fergus (Stephen Rea), who is involved in the kidnapping of English solider Jody (Forrest Whittaker.)  Soon Fergus finds himself pursued by the English as well as the IRA, which feels he has betrayed them; he hides himself in the crowds of London, where he is attracted to Jody's girl--the elegant Dill (Jaye Davidson.)  But the more Fergus tries to avoid danger, the more it swells around him, threatening to engulf both Dill and himself.I first saw THE CRYING GAME in its theatrical release and came to the film knowing absolutely nothing about it.  It was a remarkable experience because each time I became convinced I knew what the film was about I was wrong: the story, the characters, the dialogue, the cinematography took an unexpected turn and proceeded down a completely unanticipated path.  Although I was impressed, I wondered if the film would be as effective on a second or third viewing--but although the movie is filled with a host of twists, it is not superficial; it does indeed hold up to repeated viewings, for each time one sees it one becomes aware of additional nuances that one missed before.So what, ultimately, is THE CRYING GAME about?  It is an extremely difficult film to define, but in the end I think it is about the nature of love.  We cannot predict who we will love, who will love us, or what the outcome of that love will be--but even though we may struggle for it or against it, love drives us with a powerful force into situations and conclusions that we may not have anticipated in our wildest dreams.  THE CRYING GAME is the labyrinth of the human heart in all its glories and follies and disconcerting effects.The collector's edition of the film comes with numerous bonuses ranging from an alternate ending to a documentary on Ireland's troubles to various ""making of"" features.  All are worth watching; most interesting, however, is director-writer Neil Jordan's commentary, which covers many aspects of both the film and his career in general.

72544,A9TG2NFA614S9,078401003X,John F. Rooney,"[0, 0]","The key to ""The Crying Game"" is the use of irony throughout the film. The irony works on various levels. It is ironic that the kidnapped black soldier (Forest Whitaker) in Northern Ireland is able to charm one of his keepers, (Fergus played by Stephen Rea), win him over. It is ironic that the soldier dies in the way he does. Irony enters into the picture more and more as it develops. Even the badinage between the girl (Dil played by Jaye Davidson) and the bartender (Col played by Jim Broadbent) is highly ironic. The movie's crisis and denouement depend upon irony.The movie relies on one of the devices of irony, the nave hero, to carry the story along. His obtuseness leads to serious consequences. The very last scene in the movie makes viewers wonder if they've been taken on a ride because the irony turns into a kind of strange brand of humor. Even though we've arrived at the very last scene after a lot of gore and numerous deaths, we find that we are faced with a somewhat comic situation because the girl has by word and facial expression maintained an ironic pitch throughout the movie, and she continues that tone in the last meeting. You get the feeling she thinks life in general is deeply ironic. She and the bartender know how ironic life really is.It's a very satisfying, well-acted, and well-directed movie that ensnares you even after frequent viewings.

72546,A2DSXA1E02C86D,078401003X,Joseph Haschka,"[15, 21]","THE CRYING GAME teaches the lesson that terrorists have relationship problems just as messy as other folks.Jody (Forrest Whitaker), a British soldier stationed in Northern Ireland, is ensnared in a honeytrap by Jude (Miranda Richardson), kidnapped, and held by Irish militants threatening his execution unless one of their own is released by the British authorities. One of Jody's captors is Fergus (Stephen Rea), who forms a sympathetic bond with his prisoner. At one point, Jody shares a photo of his significant other, Dil (Jaye Davidson), living in London, and exacts a promise from Fergus such that, in case he (Jody) is executed, Fergus will search out Dil and share drinks at the local pub. Jody fails to regain his freedom, but not for the obvious reason. In any case, Fergus ferries over to England and makes the acquaintance of Dil, a hairdresser, through the ruse of getting a haircut. An attraction develops between Fergus and Dil after the former helps the latter out of a tough spot with an overly aggressive male admirer.I feel a smidgen of guilt for awarding THE CRYING GAME four stars instead of five since the clever screenplay unfolds as a series of unexpected events. The first half of the film culminates when Fergus is privy to a stunning revelation. However, from then on, even after Fergus's IRA colleagues arrive in London and coerce him into another attack on the establishment, the pace of the film seemed relatively languorous as both Fergus and Dil come to grips with, um, issues. I was left marveling at the mess into which Fergus had gotten himself. The conclusion seemed positively anticlimactic, although justice was served and dues paid all around.Rea is effective as Fergus, though his perpetually sad, hangdog look wouldn't garner him the Charming Boyo of the Year award. The film's best acting job is by Davidson as the emotionally tormented Dil, and an Oscar should have arguably been won for that performance.If one believes that life is a comedy, then THE CRYING GAME is surely dark humor, though I suspect the film's makers didn't intend it to be. I guess it depends on one's sense of irony. The pleasure of the viewing experience is ultimately in traveling down paths completely hidden during the first thirty minutes of screen time.

However, it is all a set up and he is kidnapped by the Irish Republican Army (IRA) and has three days to live unless the IRA's demands are met.  During this time, one of the IRA soldiers, Fergus (Stephen Rea), befriends Jody and they tell each other personal stories.  As the third day approaches, they become aware of what the near future holds for Jody, since British troops have not answered the IRA's demands.  When Jody thinks of this he asks Fergus if he could go to London and tell his beloved Dil that he was thinking of her before he died.  Fergus does not want to think about it, but when everything goes wrong he finds that he must leave Ireland and cross the waters to England.  This presents a chance to fulfill Jody's last wish; however, will the truth be as in Jody's stories?

Herschend,"[1, 1]","I knew the plot twist before attempting this film, and I still felt impacted.Very genuine; very engrossing; very romantic (which, of course, is what is so surprising). Jaye Davidson is a very prepossessing and erotic human being...period. Staggering is the power with which he pulls in the audience. His character is so emotional and vulnerable. So lovely. And Stephen Rea's character charms and does honor to humanity's most noble qualities. A man of conscience, strength, and honesty. To see these two people interact and grow to care for one another, despite several rather formidable obstacles, encourages me about the future of mankind.I don't think much fuss can be made about the political context of the film. To be frank, I hardly noticed any pandering or chauvinism. One could argue the IRA is sullied by its portrayal as unnecessarily violent and cruel. However, given what little I know about IRA tactics during the Troubles, it's difficult to claim an unfair representation of that organization's...methodology.Even so, this flick is about people. It's about sexuality. It's about the barriers people in society erect regarding who can love who and under what circumstances. And The Crying Game makes a good try at eliminating pre-conceived notions. In other words, tough guys can love other guys (and that love may or may not be sexual). I realize that these days, with same-sex marriage at the forefront of political and cultural discourse, the film's message may seem a little trite. But the audience should consider 1992 and what it was like to be gay then. This movie had a lot to say about the subject when so few were willing to acknowledge it openly.

72556,A2NJO6YE954DBH,078401003X,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[2, 4]","Unfortunately by the time I got to the theater to see ""The Crying Game"" I already knew about the big surprise.  I had been avoiding seeing or hearing anything about the movie and was flipping channels when I paused on David Letterman long enough for him to give away the big surprise.  I was no more happy with his off-the cuff revealation than I was when Charles Schulz revealed the ending to ""Citizen Kane"" one Sunday in ""Peanuts.""  However, in the final analysis what makes Neil Jordan's 1992 film really memorable is not the big surprise, but rather that the writer-director comes up with a fourth act to take what has been set up in the previous three to a new level.[I will endeavor to write this review without giving away the big secret although in the wake of Jaye Davidson's Oscar nomination and Billy Crystal's memorable song about ""The Crying Game"" at the Academy Awards there cannot be too many people who are not in on the surprise at this point.]Act One has Jude (Miranda Richardson) enticing Jody (Forest Whitaker), a English soldier stationed in Northern Ireland, into an IRA trap.  Jody is taken to a secluded house in the forest where he is watched over by Fergus (Stephen Rea), who seems to have more of a conscience that the rest of the group.  Maguire (Adrian Dunbar), the leader of the group, plans on exchanging Jody for members of the IRA held by the British, but neither Jody nor Fergus think there is much chance of that happening.  The question is whether Fergus is going to be able to shoot Jody when the inevitable moment comes, and while this could be (and has been) the subject of an entire film, it is only Jordan's opening act.In Act Two we find that Fergus has changed his name to Jimmy and is doing construction work to hide out from both the British and the IRA.  Haunted by a photograph of Jody and his girlfriend, ""Jimmy"" visits the salon where she works and has Dil (Jaye Davidson) do his hair.  Jimmy is attracted to Dil, but his feelings include a mixture of guilt as well.  Clearly this relationship is headed for the inevitable moment when Dil finds out that Jimmy was involved with what happened to Jody.  Again, this is a storyline that has been the subject of entire movies, but the twist is that before Dil finds out Jimmy's big secret, Dil has a bigger surprise for Jimmy.As we get into Act Three the focus is clearly on what will happen to the relationship between Jimmy and Dil.  Jordan does a reasonable good job of playing it as being able to go either way, and although we have our suspicions given what we know about Jimmy, I think we are dealing with shades of gray rather than clearcut black & white.  It is at this point that Jordan earns his fifth star by coming up with a final act where what happened in the previous acts comes back with a vengeance.Ultimately, what makes this a very good film is the simple fact that you do not see how the end game is going to play out (including the final scene and the song selected for the fade to black).  There are certainly those who saw the big surprise coming from the start (I went to the movie with one of those people), but beyond the strong feeling that things are not going to work out well in the end the ending of ""The Crying Game"" is not at all predictable.  Besides, what matters is not what happens but what Jimmy is trying to do, against the mounting odds.The credit for the success of this film clearly goes to Jordan, as writer and director, which is amply evidences by the ""alternate ending"" provided on the DVD.  This was the ending first shot for the movie, at the dictate of the backers, but was jettisoned in favor of the ending originally written, which was then shot.  But ""The Crying Game"" also has the advantage of Rea's moving performance.  He makes what his character feels and does seem totally believable in the face of an entire series of truly bizarre situations, and whatever shortcomings there are in the first time performance of Davidson are more than counter-balanced by what Rae does in this film.",5,In the end the story matters more than the infamous surprise,1106697600,"01 26, 2005",2005,4036,"['Unfortunately', 'time', 'got', 'theater', 'see', 'Crying', 'Game', 'already', 'knew', 'big', 'surprise', 'had', 'been', 'avoiding', 'seeing', 'hearing', 'anything', 'movie', 'was', 'flipping', 'channels', 'when', 'paused', 'David', 'Letterman', 'long', 'enough', 'give', 'away', 'big', 'surprise', 'was', 'more', 'happy', 'off-the', 'cuff', 'revealation', 'was', 'when', 'Charles', 'Schulz', 'revealed', 'ending', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'one', 'Sunday', 'Peanuts', 'However', 'final', 'analysis', 'what', 'Neil', 'Jordan', '1992', 'film', 'really', 'memorable', 'not', 'big', 'surprise', 'rather', 'writer-director', 'up', 'fourth', 'act', 'take', 'what', 'been', 'set', 'up', 'previous', 'three', 'new', 'level', '[', 'will', 'endeavor', 'write', 'review', 'giving', 'away', 'big', 'secret', 'wake', 'Jaye', 'Davidson', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'Billy', 'Crystal', 'memorable', 'song', 'Crying', 'Game', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'too', 'many', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'surprise', 'point', 'Act', 'One', 'Jude', 'Miranda', 'Richardson', 'enticing', 'Jody', 'Forest', 'Whitaker', 'English', 'soldier', 'stationed', 'Northern', 'Ireland', 'IRA', 'trap', 'Jody', 'taken', 'secluded', 'house', 'forest', 'where', 'watched', 'Fergus', 'Stephen', 'Rea', 'who', 'have', 'more', 'conscience', 'rest', 'group', 'Maguire', 'Adrian', 'Dunbar', 'leader', 'group', 'exchanging', 'Jody', 'members', 'IRA', 'held', 'British', 'Jody', 'Fergus', 'think', 'much', 'chance', 'happening', 'question', 'Fergus', 'going', 'be', 'able', 'shoot', 'Jody', 'when', 'inevitable', 'moment', 'could', 'be', 'been', 'subject', 'entire', 'film', 'only', 'Jordan', 'opening', 'act.In', 'Act', 'Two', 'find', 'Fergus', 'changed', 'name', 'Jimmy', 'doing', 'construction', 'work', 'hide', 'out', 'British', 'IRA', 'Haunted', 'photograph', 'Jody', 'girlfriend', 'Jimmy', 'salon', 'where', 'Dil', 'Jaye', 'Davidson', 'do', 'hair', 'Jimmy', 'attracted', 'Dil', 'feelings', 'include', 'mixture', 'guilt', 'well', 'Clearly', 'relationship', 'headed', 'inevitable', 'moment', 'when', 'Dil', 'out', 'Jimmy', 'was', 'involved', 'what', 'happened', 'Jody', 'Again', 'storyline', 'been', 'subject', 'entire', 'movies', 'twist', 'Dil', 'out', 'Jimmy', 'big', 'secret', 'Dil', 'bigger', 'surprise', 'Jimmy.As', 'get', 'Act', 'Three', 'focus', 'clearly', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'relationship', 'Jimmy', 'Dil', 'Jordan', 'reasonable', 'good', 'job', 'playing', 'being', 'able', 'go', 'way', 'have', 'suspicions', 'given', 'what', 'know', 'Jimmy', 'think', 'are', 'dealing', 'shades', 'gray', 'rather', 'clearcut', 'black', 'white', 'point', 'Jordan', 'fifth', 'star', 'coming', 'up', 'final', 'act', 'where', 'what', 'happened', 'previous', 'acts', 'back', 'vengeance.Ultimately', 'what', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'simple', 'fact', 'do', 'not', 'see', 'how', 'end', 'game', 'going', 'play', 'out', 'including', 'final', 'scene', 'song', 'selected', 'fade', 'black', 'are', 'certainly', 'who', 'saw', 'big', 'surprise', 'coming', 'start', 'went', 'movie', 'one', 'people', 'strong', 'feeling', 'things', 'are', 'not', 'going', 'work', 'out', 'well', 'end', 'ending', 'Crying', 'Game', 'not', 'predictable', 'Besides', 'what', 'matters', 'not', 'what', 'what', 'Jimmy', 'trying', 'do', 'mounting', 'odds.The', 'credit', 'success', 'film', 'clearly', 'Jordan', 'writer', 'director', 'amply', 'evidences', 'alternate', 'ending', 'provided', 'DVD', 'was', 'ending', 'first', 'shot', 'movie', 'dictate', 'backers', 'was', 'jettisoned', 'favor', 'ending', 'originally', 'written', 'was', 'then', 'shot', 'Crying', 'Game', 'also', 'advantage', 'Rea', 'moving', 'performance', 'what', 'character', 'feels', 'seem', 'totally', 'believable', 'face', 'entire', 'series', 'truly', 'bizarre', 'situations', 'shortcomings', 'are', 'first', 'time', 'performance', 'Davidson', 'are', 'more', 'counter-balanced', 'what', 'Rae', 'film']",N/A

Forest Whitaker, Stephen Rea, and Jaye Davidson all give compelling and moving performances. Miranda Richardson also gives an absorbing performance as a hard nosed IRA terrorist.The movie begins with IRA terrorists capturing a British soldier named Jodi, affectingly played by Forest Whitaker. One of the erstwhile terrorists, Fergus, sensitively played by Stephen Rea, is on the fringes of the terrorist group and assigned to guard the hapless Jodi. As they spend time together, a curious bond begins to form. Jodi, knowing that he will ultimately be executed, shows Fergus a photograph of his girlfriend, Dil, and extracts a promise from Fergus that he would let Dil know that Jodi was thinking of her at the last. Fergus reluctantly agrees.When Fergus is finally ordered by his hard nosed IRA associates to shoot Jodi, he hesitates, and Jodi takes off running. Not wanting to shoot him in the back, Jodi manages to make it to a main roadway, where he is run over by a truck and killed. Fergus then deserts his terrorist buddies and goes to make good on his promise to Jodi.When Fergus finds Dil, poignantly played by Jaye Davidson, she is working in a club and singing &quot;The Crying Game&quot;. Fergus gives her a false name and insinuates himself into her graces, as there is a palpable attraction. They begin meeting, going out, and falling in love. Then, the moment of truth ultimately arrives, and Jodi is surely having the last laugh from the great beyondJust when the viewer thiks that things cannot get any stranger, Miranda Richardson turns up, demanding that Fergus perform another act of terrorism in order to redeem himself for having failed so badly during his last foray into terrorism. To ensure his compliance, Richardson implies that Dil may be a target, should he not cooperate with the new scheme.Fergus reluctantly agrees to participate in the IRA plot and commits himself to what is, in essence, a suicide mission. Dil, however, interferes with his plan at the eleventh hour, putting both herself and Fergus in danger of a retaliatory attack from Fergus' IRA buddies.After his plan goes awry, all hell breaks loose. Suffice to say, true love does seem to conquer all.

Although Forest Whitaker's character is only in the film for the first ten minutes you can feel his presence throughout.Of course the one memorable scene for most people is Dil's revelation, but there are other scenes that are more intimate. Jody telling Fergus the story of the Scorpion and the Frog is wonderful; but an even better scene is when Jody asks Fergus to tell him a story, and Fergus replies: ""When I was a child, I thought as a child.."" The acting, setting, mood and deliverance of these two scenes are pitch perfect.To me the most fascinating thing about the movie is Fergus' feelings for Dil. Even though he is disgusted with the revelation he is still drawn to her.

72572,AZ9JWGE1UGKZA,078401003X,R.A. McKenzie,"[7, 7]","THE CRYING GAME has been described as many things, and all of them probably true.  Even after 15 years after its initial release, it remains writer-director Neil Jordan's insurmountable masterpiece.  Not many casual moviegoers seem to know about this one, but serious film buffs hold this dramatic gem along the greatest cinematic landmarks.  This film hasn't changed the landscape of moviegoing as we know it, but it's impacted the souls of those who've embarked on its journey.And what a journey it is...one so intriguing and fascinating that longtime fans still refuse to give away its secrets.  When THE CRYING GAME was marketted back in 1992, Miramax and Jordan urged audiences to not reveal the plot twists.  That audiences respected their wishes is an unbelievable acheivement.  The acheivement was so remarkable that even though I didn't see this film until 2003, I instantly knew that my blabbering wouldn't ruin just a few cheap shocks.  No no no, to talk about THE CRYING GAME in too much detail is to deprive audiences of a legitimate emotional connection with the characters.Let's get the plot setup out the way; if I weren't to include it, I'd be talking to myself when I want others to share my experiences.  Several IRA operatives kidnap a British soldier, holding him for ransom.  As Jody (the British soldier) is held captive, an IRA volunteer named Fergus reluctantly befriends his target.  Basically, it's Stockholm Syndrome backwards --- rather than the victim embracing his/her captor, Fergus is eager to use the carrot rather than the stick.  As things develop poorly for Jody, Fergus ends up looking for Jody's lover, Dil.  From there, I will reveal no more...The word ""unpredictable"" is an understatement.  To call THE CRYING GAME a tale of love or loyalty does not do this film justice.  This masterpiece deserves to be known as a ""drama"" in the truest sense.  Webster's definiton is:""A COMPOSITION IN VERSE OR PROSE INTENDED TO PORTRAY LIFE OR CHARACTER OR TO TELL A STORY USUALLY INVOLVING CONFLICTS AND EMOTIONS THROUGH ACTION AND DIALOGUE AND TYPICALLY DESIGNED FOR THEATRICAL PERFORMANCE.""A story like THE CRYING GAME's might not be plausible in our physical world, but the triangle involving Fergus, Jody, and Dil is every bit as interesting as a romantic or spiritual connection can be.  When the definition refers to ""a composition in verse or"", I think Neil Jordan's film is constructed in acts very similar to PSYCHO.  Although we don't meet very many characters, Jordan seems to keep reinventing what they're about.  The central focus or narrative is in a constant growth, which is interesting considering Fergus is almost in every shot.Another interesting note about the verses: Jordan's selection of music is appropriate on a variety of levels.  He uses ""The Crying Game"" in several versions, each telling a different story.  Percy Sledge's ""When A Man Loves A Woman"" opens the movie, and takes on new meaning if you watch the film several times (aside from the obvious ""joke"").  Anne Dudley's score for the film is a jack-of-all-trades, using military drums for intensity, and classier & seductive instruments for reflection and discovery.  It's a rather wonderful music soundtrack.The verses and prose continue with unbelievable sequences of dialogue.  Just listening to these characters talk is an absolute joy.""I can't help it.  It's in my nature.""When a headbagged Jody tells his captor the fable of how a scorpion betrays a frog after being helped across a pond, we relate to Fergus.  We realize the visceral impact of the story, but not the cerebral effect.  We react, but do not understand.  THE CRYING GAME works as a tease, but each time delivers a payoff, and each payoff is an unexpected development.I think most of this movie's fans' favorite narrative tool is Col, Dil's preferred bartender.  In Dil's early scenes, instead of talking directly to Fergus across the bar, she thinks aloud to Col, which the drink-server relays Dil's comments to Fergus.DIL: ""Ask him if he likes his haircut.""COL: ""She wants to know, sir, do you like your hair?""FERGUS: ""Tell her I like it fine.""And to finally on comment on THE CRYING GAME's dramatic ""theatricality"", the pacing is tight with its 2-hour length.  The film works a variety of tones from comedy to violence, from love to hate, and from love and loss.  The presentation isn't corny like an American filmmaker would've treated this subject.  We believe in the story not only because of Jordan's sensibilities, but also because this story has yet to be replicated.  Few screenplays command such respect from future artists.I could go on and on about this work of genius.  Thankfully, I still haven't given away anything.  THE CRYING GAME's truest admirers haven't, either.  And once you've watched the film, you'll come up with clever ways to entice newcomers into the fold, while struggling to keep a tight lip.DVD EXTRAS---This Special Edition DVD includes a making-of documentary, which includes interviews from Stephen Rea, studio execs, Neil Jordan, and even two military officers from both sides of the Northern Ireland conflict.  Jaye Davison (who played Dil) is noticeably absent, but Davison has been long-removed from the spotlight, so that's not a surprise.  There's also an alternate ending that the studios insisted upon.  The Alternate ending isn't terrible, but Jordan's original ending is vastly superior.",5,True Love Is Half-Blind,1214870400,"07 1, 2008",2008,5416,"['CRYING', 'GAME', 'been', 'described', 'many',

There is a surprise twist in this movie but I will try not to give it away.The story, as I saw it, was the guilt of one man who felt himself responsible for the death of another man.  Whether or not the man is guilty as such is left up to the viewer.  His sense of guilt causes him to question his values.  As he begins to discard his values, his conscience leads him to embrace the dead man's values.  He, in essence, is sacrificing his life and attempting to recreate himself as the dead man.  The ""twist"" to this story is an essential part of this transistion because it forces the main character to discard more than he had imagined.  In accepting even this aspect of his new life, he has completed his metamorphasis.I saw this movie but once and I was stunned with its' message.

72581,A3RNP5X8ZGZIEI,078401003X,Stephanie De Pue,"[2, 3]","Neil Jordan's ""The Crying Game"" was the talk of the town when it opened in 1992, largely due to its surprise ending, of course.  But it won an Oscar for best original screenplay, and another 17 awards, and had 16 more award nominations.  It was a good movie.  Well, by now, the surprise ending isn't such a big surprise, the title song's still famous, and it's still a good movie.  It was written and directed by the Irish Neil Jordan; Nik Powell gets an executive producer credit.  It was well-cast, with the Oscar-winning Jim Broadbent, Adrian Dunbar, Stephen Rea, and Miranda Richardson in lead roles.  The American Forest Whitaker, despite his wavering London accent, turned in one of his best pre-Oscar performances.  And it introduced Jay Davidson in a stunning debut.The movie opens unforgettably, during the height of the Irish troubles, at a carnival somewhere near Belfast, Ireland.  Jude (Miranda Richardson) who plays a great bitch, seems intent on seducing Jody (Whitaker), a British soldier.  But we quickly learn that she's actually intent on having him taken hostage by her insurgent Irish Republican Army co-conspirators, and he is.  During Jody's captivity, he forms a relationship with one of his IRA keepers, Fergus (Rea), who's not the brightest in his unit; they tell each other the story of the frog and the scorpion, that will become famous folklore.  Jody believes he won't survive his captivity, and asks Fergus to look up his London girlfriend, Dil (Davidson.)  Fergus will be assigned to kill Jody; we'll never know if he could, as the author Jordan finds another, shocking way to set his story in motion.  So Fergus flees to London, where he can live the anonymous life of an Irish laborer. and does, indeed, look up Dil.This powerful opening sets the movie on its memorable, dreamlike course.  It's an IRA drama, a star-crossed lovers' romance, and a hostage drama.  The acting's first rate, particularly that of Stephen Rea, who holds the film together (he lost the Oscar to Al Pacino that year.)  Rea give us a Fergus who's a not too bright schnook, just trying to get through life while causing as little damage as possible.  Furthermore, he's another of Jordan's unfortunate heroes who can't help falling in love with the wrong female.  We know Dil will never be the woman Fergus thought she was.

It isn't the film's &quot;gimmick&quot; that sells me (and in fact it made the movie a bit of an acquired taste for me...I didn't like it the first time I saw it), and in fact I hardly think about it at all now when I think of why I adore this film. It's the beauty of human nature reflected in its very-human characters in difficult, human situations. I think that the movie was made by its acting, particularly Stephen Rea, Jaye Davidson, and Forrest Whitaker. Stephen Rea in particular is absolutely pivotal to this movie's deserved acclaim, and I think he was robbed for not winning an award for his best role ever (in my opinion)...he gave Feargus a life and humanity that I think probably surprised even Neil Jordan himself.The Crying Game is Neil Jordan's and Stephen Rea's best work ever and one of the best films I've ever seen. You owe it to yourself to at least view it once, although at the very reasonable price it's going for, my recommendation is to just go ahead and buy it. You could (and probably have, considering the DVD best-seller list here) do a lot worse.One negative with the DVD: it isn't mastered in Dolby 5.1 (just 2.0), and there are no real extras to speak of. The film deserves so much better.",5,Stephen Rea = incredible.,999907200,"09 8, 2001",2001,1902,"['saw', 'film', 'least', 'ten', 'times', 'back', 'release', 'days', 'VHS', 'held', 'off', 'buying', 'DVD', 'thinking', ""'d"", 'already', 'worn', 'out', 'viewings', 'would', 'just', 'be', 'sick', 'Well', 'fed', 'up', 'lackluster', 'DVDs', 'collection', 'was', 'rapidly', 'amassing', 'partially', 'basis', 'idiotic', 'word-of-mouth', 'hype', 'many', 'Amazon', 'reviews', 'finally', 'decided', 'go', 'something', 'knew', 'was', 'good', 'bought', 'Well', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'three', 'times', 'now', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'kind', 'movie', 'collection', 'such', 'wonderful', 'film', 'more', 'beautiful', 'side', 'human', 'emotion', 'nature', 'surfacing', 'circumstance', ""n't"", 'film', 'quot', 'quot', 'fact', 'made', 'movie', 'bit', 'acquired', 'taste', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'first', 'time', 'saw', 'fact', 'hardly', 'think', 'now', 'when', 'think', 'why', 'adore', 'film', 'beauty', 'human', 'nature', 'reflected', 'very-human', 'characters', 'difficult', 'human', 'situations', 'think', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'acting', 'particularly', 'Stephen', 'Rea', 'Jaye', 'Davidson', 'Forrest', 'Whitaker', 'Stephen', 'Rea', 'particular', 'absolutely', 'pivotal', 'movie', 'deserved', 'acclaim', 'think', 'was', 'robbed', 'not', 'winning', 'award', 'best', 'role', 'ever', 'opinion', 'gave', 'Feargus', 'life', 'humanity', 'think', 'probably', 'surprised', 'even', 'Neil', 'Jordan', 'himself.The', 'Crying', 'Game', 'Neil', 'Jordan', 'Stephen', 'Rea', 'best', 'work', 'ever', 'one', 'best', 'films', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'owe', 'yourself', 'least', 'view', 'once', 'very', 'reasonable', 'price', 'going', 'recommendation', 'just', 'go', 'ahead', 'buy', 'could', 'probably', 'have', 'considering', 'DVD', 'best-seller', 'list', 'here', 'do', 'lot', 'worse.One', 'negative', 'DVD', ""n't"", 'mastered', 'Dolby', '5.1', 'just', '2.0', 'are', 'real', 'extras', 'speak', 'film', 'so', 'much', 'better']",N/A

72590,AQP1VPK16SVWM,078401003X,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[32, 36]","Still an amazing film over a decade later, The Crying Game continues to resonate with power due to its themes of obsession and redemption. Jordan's film plays tricks with its twisting plot structure and change in tone similar to its inspiration Vertigo. Stephen Rea plays Fergus a gunman for the IRA who helps take a soldier named Jody (Forest Whittaker) hostage. They plan on trading him for a senior member of the IRA being taken by the British. Fergus later becomes obsessed with Jody's girlfriend Dil (Jay Davidson) a hairdresser by day who performs in a bar in the evenings lip synching her favorite songs. Fergus begins to fall in love with Dil. Is it guilt that drives him into her arms? He's not sure.  Suddenly, Fergus and Jude are thrust into the middle of the conflict between the IRA and the British. Fergus gets sucked into Jody's life and becomes obssessed with helping Dil and seeing more about the life of the man he kidnapped.The plot is far more complex than the synopsis I've given. If you haven't seen the film (or heard about it), do yourself a favor to read as little about the plot as possible. While the surprises in the plot don't define the film's quality, they do involve the viewer in the story. So keep it simple and just rent the movie (or buy it if you've seen it before). With strong performances from Rea as the world weary Fergus, Richardson as the aggressive and hateful Jude, Whitaker as Jody and Davidson as Dil, The Crying Game demonstrates Jordan's uncanny skills as a storyteller and film director. The fact that it wasn't recognized with only an Oscar for writing is a crime considering what was released the same year.With a crisp, clear image The Crying Game looks particularly good in this DVD transfer. The bright colors and grainy textures of the original film are well reproduced. Although the darker sequences of the film occasionally look a bit murky, the transfer looks exceptionally good overall. The 5.1 surround sound mix and 2.0 mix both have great presence.We get the originally shot ending of the film which differs substantially from the final version. The BBC's Channel 4 originally agreed to back the film but only if Jordan would write and shoot a different ending from the final version (the one that's seen in the film is the original version as written). This version is included from a VHS rough assembly of the film so doesn't have the best picture quality but does provide an idea of what the film might have looked like. Northern Troubles is a documentary looking at Ireland from two different view points; an Irish Catholic and Protestant Loyalist who drove the filmmakers around to interview people about the making of the film. Interestingly, it provides considerable insight into the current and past political troubles of this beautiful country. Images of violence and conflict appear everywhere throughout the landscape. The Making of The Crying Game bundles together a number of featurettes to produce a documentary that provides a comprehensive look at the film's production. Featuring Stephen Rea, Neil Jordan and many of the principle production members, it can be viewed in one sitting or watched as individual featurettes. Stephen Wooley the producer of the film discusses the nasty reception that the film received at Cannes by American distributors.There's also a discussion of Miramax's part in effectively marketing a very difficult film to an audience used to popcorn thrillers. Wooley discusses the press reception and how Miramax used this for a brilliant marketing campaign that captured the attention of audiences but also focusing encouraging viewers to not discuss the ""secret"" of the film. We also get the original trailer and a featurette on Madame Jojo's today.Neil Jordan provides a comprehensive commentary track focusing on the visual images that inspired the story including the places from his childhood that showed up in the film. Jordan also discusses the twists in the plot so, by all means, watch the film prior to listening to it with the commentary track.Lion's Gate has done a great job of updating and upgrading this terrific film for DVD. The previous version looked very good as well but the image quality in this anamorphic transfer gives it the edge. The inclusion of a commentary track, documentary and featurettes gives viewers an idea of the world that The Crying Game occurs in. The crisp, sharp image quality and overall transfer looks exceptionally good as well making this essential for fans of the movie.",5,"One of Jordan's best films along with ""Mona Lisa""",1107561600,"02 5, 2005",2005,4522,"['Still', 'amazing', 'film', 'decade', 'later', 'Crying', 'Game', 'resonate', 'power', 'due', 'themes', 'obsession', 'redemption', 'Jordan', 'film', 'tricks', 'twisting', 'plot', 'structure', 'change', 'tone', 'similar', 'inspiration', 'Vertigo', 'Stephen', 'Rea', 'Fergus', 'gunman', 'IRA', 'who', 'take', 'soldier', 'named', 'Jody', 'Forest', 'Whittaker', 'hostage', 'plan', 'trading', 'senior', 'member', 'IRA', 'being', 'taken', 'British', 'Fergus', 'later', 'obsessed', 'Jody', 'girlfriend', 'Dil', 'Jay', 'Davidson', 'hairdresser', 'day', 'who', 'bar', 'evenings', 'lip', 'synching', 'favorite', 'songs', 'Fergus', 'fall', 'love', 'Dil', 'arms', 'not', 'sure', 'Suddenly', 'Fergus', 'Jude', 'are', 'thrust', 'middle', 'conflict', 'IRA', 'British', 'Fergus', 'sucked', 'Jody', 'life', 'becomes', 'obssessed', 'helping', 'Dil', 'seeing', 'more', 'life', 'man', 'plot', 'far', 'more', 'complex', 'synopsis', ""'ve"", 'given', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'film', 'heard', 'do', 'favor', 'read', 'little', 'plot', 'possible', 'surprises', 'plot', 'do', ""n't"", 'define', 'film', 'quality', 'do', 'involve', 'viewer', 'story', 'So', 'keep', 'simple', 'just', 'rent', 'movie', 'buy', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'strong', 'performances', 'Rea', 'world', 'weary', 'Fergus', 'Richardson', 'aggressive', 'hateful', 'Jude', 'Whitaker', 'Jody', 'Davidson', 'Dil', 'Crying', 'Game', 'Jordan', 'uncanny', 'skills', 'storyteller', 'film', 'director', 'fact', 'was', ""n't"", 'recognized', 'only', 'Oscar', 'writing', 'crime', 'considering', 'what', 'was', 'released', 'same', 'year.With', 'crisp', 'clear', 'image', 'Crying', 'Game', 'particularly', 'good', 'DVD', 'transfer', 'bright', 'colors', 'grainy', 'textures', 'original', 'film', 'are', 'well', 'reproduced', 'darker', 'sequences', 'film', 'occasionally', 'look', 'bit', 'murky', 'transfer', 'exceptionally', 'good', 'overall', '5.1', 'surround', 'sound', 'mix', '2.0', 'mix', 'have', 'great', 'presence.We', 'get', 'originally', 'shot', 'ending', 'film', 'differs', 'substantially', 'final', 'version', 'BBC', 'Channel', '4', 'originally', 'agreed', 'back', 'film', 'only', 'Jordan', 'would', 'write', 'shoot', 'different', 'ending', 'final', 'version', 'one', 'seen', 'film', 'original', 'version', 'written', 'version', 'included', 'VHS', 'rough', 'assembly', 'film', 'so', ""n't"", 'have', 'best', 'picture', 'quality', 'provide', 'idea', 'what', 'film', 'might', 'have', 'looked', 'Northern', 'Troubles', 'documentary', 'looking', 'Ireland', 'two', 'different', 'view', 'points', 'Irish', 'Catholic', 'Protestant', 'Loyalist', 'who', 'drove', 'filmmakers', 'interview', 'people', 'making', 'film', 'Interestingly', 'considerable', 'insight', 'current', 'past', 'political', 'troubles', 'beautiful', 'country', 'Images', 'violence', 'conflict', 'appear', 'everywhere', 'landscape', 'Making', 'Crying', 'Game', 'together', 'number', 'featurettes', 'produce', 'documentary', 'comprehensive', 'look', 'film', 'production', 'Featuring', 'Stephen', 'Rea', 'Neil', 'Jordan', 'many', 'principle', 'production', 'members', 'can', 'be', 'viewed', 'one', 'sitting', 'watched', 'individual', 'featurettes', 'Stephen', 'Wooley', 'producer', 'film', 'nasty', 'reception', 'film', 'received', 'Cannes', 'American', 'also', 'discussion', 'Miramax', 'part', 'effectively', 'marketing', 'very', 'difficult', 'film', 'audience', 'used', 'popcorn', 'thrillers', 'Wooley', 'press', 'reception', 'how', 'Miramax', 'used', 'brilliant', 'marketing', 'campaign', 'captured', 'attention', 'audiences', 'also', 'focusing', 'encouraging', 'viewers', 'not', 'discuss', 'secret', 'film', 'also', 'get', 'original', 'trailer', 'featurette', 'Madame', 'Jojo', 'today.Neil', 'Jordan', 'comprehensive', 'commentary', 'track', 'focusing', 'visual', 'images', 'inspired', 'story', 'including', 'places', 'childhood', 'showed', 'up', 'film', 'Jordan', 'also', 'twists', 'plot', 'so', 'means', 'watch', 'film', 'prior', 'listening', 'commentary', 'track.Lion', 'Gate', 'done', 'great', 'job', 'updating', 'upgrading', 'terrific', 'film', 'DVD', 'previous', 'version', 'looked', 'very', 'good', 'well', 'image', 'quality', 'anamorphic', 'transfer', 'edge', 'inclusion', 'commentary', 'track', 'documentary', 'viewers', 'idea', 'world', 'Crying', 'Game', 'crisp', 'sharp', 'image', 'quality', 'overall', 'transfer', 'exceptionally', 'good', 'well', 'making', 'essential', 'fans', 'movie']",N/A

I adore the cinematography, which resembles the anamorphic films of the 70's and early 80's. The lenses utilized certainly have that look of vintage Panavision camerawork, a style I miss DEARLY. The acting is miraculous. Everyone, and I mean EVERYONE is PERFECT. I get so lost in the storytelling because everything is so well executed. And the ending. Oh, I just positively LOVE IT!!

It features great performances from Miranda Richardson, Stephen Rea, Forest Whitaker, Jim Broadbent, and the unforgetable Jaye Davidson! It's a very original supense thriller that deals with love, sex, and revenge. It's not for all audiences, and you  must watch it at your own risk, because I have heard that some people didn't make it pass halfway of this film, just like the shock that Fergus(Rea) had to go through.Jody(Whitaker) was seduced and abducted by the (Jude)Miranda Richardson and her fellow partner(Rea) in crimes. He was gunned down when he tried to escaped. Fergus went to find Jody's girlfriend at the Metro, there he met the sultry and beautiful Dill(Davidson), and later she gave him a haircut. Fergus didn't tell her that he was involved in the hostage of her dead boyfriend. He soon got romantically  involved with Dill, depite the fact that Richardson would inevitably mess things up. Fergus helped Dill get rid of her current money greedy bad boyfriend, who was abusive to her and constantly wanted her to ""perform"" for him. Yes, Dill is a great hairdresser by day, and a fabulous performer by night. Her best number is The Cryig Game. Just when Fergus was falling in love with Dill, she had an unexpected surprise for him.......Jim Broadbent is great, even though he has very little screen time. He plays a seen-it-all bartender, who was a good friend to Dill, and his favorite line was: ""Who knows the secret of the human heart.""Forest Whitaker only appeared in the early part of the film as well as in Fergus' imagination sequence. He was very good when he held hostage, and he conveyed all the fear of his character.Miranda Richardson gave a scene stealing performace. The accent, the mysterious and dangerous looks were perfect for her nasty [...].Stephen Rea got his best actor nomination for his character that was torn between good and bad, and vulnerability.Finally, this movie made Jaye Davidson a star, and it gave everyone something to talk about. I thought she should've gotten the Oscar, because she was incomparable. The stage performing scene was great, so was the love scene, and definitely the scene when she shot (Jude)Miranda Richardson to bits as she shouted at her'"" You killed my Jody, didn't you ******* bitch? You used your little **** and *** to seduced my Jody....""

It's actually quite difficult to pinpoint the brilliances of each actor since they all trumped eachother with moments of brilliance in their performances.  I of course love Jaye Davidson's character, I related to alot of her pain, and emotion.

Her character is so venomnous I want to bash her face in at some points during the movie.  I always knew Forest Whitacker would go on to do more great things.  Any actor that drools and spits out his mouth in almost every role is worthy of AN OSCAR!!!!!!  He deserves the praise and the reward.  Glad he won the oscar for ""Last King Of Scotland"".  This is a timeless movie I can still watch every blue moon.",5,A+++++ Acting,1196985600,"12 7, 2007",2007,964,"['wish', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'alot', 'dialogue', 'memorized', 'whenever', 'decide', 'rewatch', 'Crying', 'Game', 'only', 'drawnback', 'love', 'performances', 'best', 'are', 'classic', 'cinema', 'actually', 'quite', 'difficult', 'pinpoint', 'brilliances', 'actor', 'trumped', 'moments', 'brilliance', 'performances', 'course', 'love', 'Jaye', 'Davidson', 'character', 'related', 'alot', 'pain', 'emotion', 'Miranda', 'Richarson', 'was', 'most', 'intense', 'passionate', 'agruably', 'maybe', 'best', 'performance', 'had', 'choose', 'character', 'so', 'venomnous', 'want', 'bash', 'face', 'points', 'movie', 'always', 'knew', 'Forest', 'Whitacker', 'would', 'go', 'do', 'more', 'great', 'things', 'actor', 'out', 'mouth', 'almost', 'role', 'worthy', 'AN', 'OSCAR', 'praise', 'reward', 'Glad', 'won', 'oscar', 'Last', 'King', 'Scotland', 'timeless', 'movie', 'can', 'still', 'watch', 'blue', 'moon']",N/A
