983112,A3956O40ZZYFMY,B000F4RHQG,"Dennis ""barbarosa""","[0, 0]","First, about the movie. It is very well made and is basically a redux of the Shelly's old Frankenstein concept. The actors perform well and the movie as a whole is an excellent example of what probably was a direct to video vehicle.My major concern is on what basis does Amazon use to price its rentals? I saw this movie for free on another streaming channel close to two years ago if my memory serves me right and here Amazon is offering it for rent for $2.99. One again questions their Amazon Prime Membership when movies that are getting a bit long in the tooth since they were released are still costing Amazon Prime members $2.99 to rent. If any movie qualifies for free viewing for Prime members then surely this movie does.I just cannot find any rhyme nor reason concerning Amazons policy concerning which movies are available for free viewing for their Prime Members and which arent. ""Shooters"" is available for free viewing, was and remains much more popular and yet ""Subject 2"" carries with it a $2.99 premium. ""Shooters"" is also of more recent vintage than this movie. I simply don't understand.I have questioned by phone and email Amazons Customer Support about situations such as this and the seeming lack of new videos being made available for Amazon Prime Members. I would hope that someday word gets to the appropriate person and that a review of Amazons Prime Membership free viewing titles be made. As the situation now stands there is simply no rational explanation as to which movies are available for free viewing and which ones are not. And the long established lack of new movies made available for free viewing by Prime Members still exists. Will I continue to be a Prime Member when it comes time to renew again? That is a good question and is up to the decision makers at Amazon. The primer reason I am an Amazaon Prime Memeber is because it allows me access to both free and paid rentals and the occasional video purchase for streaming purposes. I am anything but happy with the current policy of the lack of new content of ""free"" movie rentals for my Prime Memebership dues.If you are considering becoming a Prime Member, do not expect anything approaching a great deal of new titles becoming made available for free viewing for your $79.99 annual fee. Unless you have a great need for second day delivery of a goodly portion of products ordered through Amazon you should consider whether or not the Prime Membership dues are worthwhile. Do not base your joining on the hopes of there being an abundance of new movies becoming available for free viewing for your Amazon Prime Membership, at least not as long as current policy exists.",3,I cannot figure out Amazons rental policy,1341100800,"07 1, 2012",2012,2662,"['First', 'movie', 'very', 'well', 'made', 'basically', 'redux', 'Shelly', 'old', 'Frankenstein', 'concept', 'actors', 'perform', 'well', 'movie', 'whole', 'excellent', 'example', 'what', 'probably', 'was', 'direct', 'video', 'vehicle.My', 'major', 'concern', 'what', 'basis', 'Amazon', 'use', 'price', 'rentals', 'saw', 'movie', 'free', 'streaming', 'channel', 'close', 'two', 'years', 'ago', 'memory', 'serves', 'right', 'here', 'Amazon', 'offering', 'rent', '2.99', 'One', 'again', 'questions', 'Amazon', 'Prime', 'Membership', 'when', 'movies', 'are', 'getting', 'bit', 'long', 'tooth', 'were', 'released', 'are', 'still', 'costing', 'Amazon', 'Prime', 'members', '2.99', 'rent', 'movie', 'qualifies', 'free', 'viewing', 'Prime', 'members', 'then', 'surely', 'movie', 'does.I', 'just', 'can', 'not', 'find', 'rhyme', 'reason', 'concerning', 'Amazons', 'policy', 'concerning', 'movies', 'are', 'available', 'free', 'viewing', 'Prime', 'Members', 'arent', 'Shooters', 'available', 'free', 'viewing', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'popular', 'yet', 'Subject', '2', '2.99', 'premium', 'Shooters', 'also', 'more', 'recent', 'vintage', 'movie', 'simply', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand.I', 'have', 'questioned', 'phone', 'email', 'Amazons', 'Customer', 'Support', 'situations', 'such', 'seeming', 'lack', 'new', 'videos', 'being', 'made', 'available', 'Amazon', 'Prime', 'Members', 'would', 'hope', 'someday', 'word', 'appropriate', 'person', 'review', 'Amazons', 'Prime', 'Membership', 'free', 'viewing', 'titles', 'be', 'made', 'situation', 'now', 'simply', 'rational', 'explanation', 'movies', 'are', 'available', 'free', 'viewing', 'ones', 'are', 'not', 'long', 'established', 'lack', 'new', 'movies', 'made', 'available', 'free', 'viewing', 'Prime', 'Members', 'still', 'Will', 'continue', 'be', 'Prime', 'Member', 'when', 'time', 'renew', 'again', 'good', 'question', 'up', 'decision', 'makers', 'Amazon', 'primer', 'reason', 'am', 'Amazaon', 'Prime', 'Memeber', 'access', 'free', 'paid', 'rentals', 'occasional', 'video', 'purchase', 'streaming', 'purposes', 'am', 'anything', 'happy', 'current', 'policy', 'lack', 'new', 'content', 'free', 'movie', 'rentals', 'Prime', 'Memebership', 'dues.If', 'are', 'considering', 'becoming', 'Prime', 'Member', 'do', 'not', 'expect', 'anything', 'approaching', 'great', 'deal', 'new', 'titles', 'becoming', 'made', 'available', 'free', 'viewing', '79.99', 'annual', 'fee', 'have', 'great', 'need', 'second', 'day', 'delivery', 'goodly', 'portion', 'products', 'ordered', 'Amazon', 'should', 'consider', 'not', 'Prime', 'Membership', 'dues', 'are', 'worthwhile', 'Do', 'not', 'base', 'joining', 'hopes', 'being', 'abundance', 'new', 'movies', 'becoming', 'available', 'free', 'viewing', 'Amazon', 'Prime', 'Membership', 'least', 'not', 'as', 'long', 'current', 'policy', 'exists']",Subject Two

983117,A3PPXVR5J6U2JD,B000F4RHQG,"Michael J. Tresca ""Talien""","[3, 3]","It took me awhile before I realized Subject Two was actually a modern remake of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein. The first hint is the name of the doctor, ""Franklyn Vick"" (Jack Nicholson clone Dean Stapleton), a take on Dr. Victor Frankenstein from the novel.  The second hint is the name of his patient, Adam (Christian Oliver) - the name Shelley gave the monster.In modern parlance, Frankenstein's monster was the first zombie.  That connection is made clear in Subject Two, where poor Adam is lured to Dr. Vick's cabin, brutally strangled, and then resuscitated...again and again and again.Subject Two takes place a snowy mountainous region is as much a character as doctor and patient. The place looks and feels isolated enough that we believe Vick can get away with murder.Subject Two is so sparse that it could easily be a stage play; there are only two additional characters, and both are intruders to the cozy world of master and servant, doctor and patient. The first is the monster's potential mate, Kate (all-American girl Courtney Mace).  Her presence is brief, but the promise of a date is a tantalizing reminder of our own mortality: love, marriage, children.  Dr. Vick takes it all away.The other character is a nameless hunter (Jurgen Jones) who accidentally stumbles on the odd couple's secret.  The outsider presence is an important test of Adam's faith in his creator. His fate is a pivotal turning point in Vick and Adam's relationship.Throughout, the experiment is a grim reminder of science at its worst. He feigns impartiality by talking into his recorder, then murders his creation as violently as possible.  Vick alternates between fretting over Adam's pain and causing it.  If there's a message in Subject Two, it's that life is pain - experiencing it is an important part of what makes life worth living. To avoid pain is to become inhuman.Subject Two could easily be a half hour shorter. There are long shots of people stumping around in the snow intercut with flashbacks and red blood cells.  But if you're patient, Subject Two is quite rewarding. The twist ending neatly ties up a scene early in the movie that starts, literally, with a bang.

There's a great deal of potential here (and I have a suspicion that had it been played more as a comedy, it might have come off a lot better), but it falls a bit short of the mark.The movie starts with headstrong medical student and blogger Adam (Speed Racer's Christian Oliver), on the verge of getting thrown out of school, responding to an email from a doctor who follows his blog and wants him to come out and be an assistant in his remote hideaway. Can you tell this is not going to end well? Once he gets there, he finds that Vick (Wildflower's Dean Stapleton), the doctor in question, is working on an offshoot of cryogenics. Problem is, what he needs is a test subject, and after Adam says he wants to help, Vick comes up behind Adam and slashes his throat. Vick then injects him with a serum designed to revive him, and... Adam wakes up. Not only that, but the migraines he's been suffering all his life have disappeared. Adam eagerly offers to help Vick perfect the serum. This involves Adam dying again and again as Vick tweaks the formula.The majority of the film is a two-person joint, which can be either brilliant or awful, depending on how it's handled. This one is much closer to brilliant, but not quite. It's quite well-paced, and the dialogue is good enough to keep the movie from becoming boring. But it seemed to me while I was watching that there was something missing. I'm not entirely sure what, but the tipoff was that the setup for the twist at the end seemed pretty obvious. I wasn't exactly sure my guess was right (it was), but I knew that something was coming. It's almost as if the script were missing a layer somehow.

You can't murder me and get away with it!I know I'm taking a horror film way too seriously but that's the problem I had with it.

These guys looked like fashion models portraying eccentric characters holed up in the rugged mountains? They seemed too far off to be playing these characters.

It has a small cast so no one stumbles over one another and you really get to know the characters.Enough people have commented on what the film is about so i'll just skip that. The reason why I didn't give it a whole five stars was because the cinematography was too nice for this kind of film and distracted me from the story somewhat. I noticed a lot of people commented on the cinematography. It is really nice. They capture some breathtaking scenes.
