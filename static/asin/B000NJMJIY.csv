Jonathan walks into a radio station with an idea for a radio show where listeners may confess their misdeeds. It leads to a caller confessing to a murder, but Jonathan's  own haunting demons and misdeeds also preoccupy him. As he gets involved in solving the mystery of the caller and the murder he falls deeper into the mire of the murder's psyche. His mystifying past lends an attraction to the suspenseful story.All of the actors fit well into their parts and do a credible job.
