Stewart plays a reporter who tells his old boss (Lionel Barrymore) that with his buddy Carny, played by Tracy who is a prisoner at Alcatraz, they can get rubber from the rubber plantations in Malaya, which is held by the Japanese Military.  Set adrift from an American submarine, with the storyline that their ship, under Irish registry was torpedoed by Americans, they escaped and landed on the beach in Malaya.  The plantation owners, save for one, are not anxious to sell or give to the Japanese and eagerly jump at the chance to join Tracy and Stewart and give their rubber to the American ship hiding at a nearby island-----for gold, of course.  Very strong acting by everyone, including Sydney Greenstreet as the &#34;Dutchman.&#34;  The Japanese colonel who is the main villian should have won an academy award because, you just hate him.  If you like the song, &#34;Blue Moon,&#34; Tracy's love interest sings a seductive version of it.  Great movie and overlooked to this day for action and drama.

355505,AIY4H4KWR2KWZ,6303091997,MadMacs,"[1, 2]","Three years after the indelible ""It's a Wonderful Life"" - comes this brief, but incredibly enjoyable reunion. Once again facing off each other - Lionel Barrymore and Jimmy Stewart.But this time, and I love this part, Jimmy plays a less-than-reputable character by the name of John Royer. Officially a newspaperman, unofficially an opportunist willing to do whatever it takes to make a buck. Quite a different dynamic than when he played good egg George Bailey - and I absolutely loved it. Even though he's in a supporting role in this film, this scene alone made it worth the purchase.It's January 1942, a month after Pearl Harbor, and the war effort is just gearing up.Interestingly, this is the first time I've screened a film which features the drive to obtain rubber during the war.All wartime critical materials were given up for our troops and several films discuss/mention sacrifices like metal, medicines, food, gas; families being given weekly ration scripts to survive on the barest necessities. But rubber - that's one that is rarely mentioned, even though it played a huge part of the homefront war effort. Before the advent of mass produceable synthetic rubber, the only way to obtain the extremely critical compound was via the rubber tree. And those trees don't grow in North America. In fact, almost the entire industry during the early part of the 20th century was found on the island nation of Malaya, what we know as Malaysia today. And in 1942, was completely overrun by invading Imperial Japanese forces.Spencer Tracy applies his usual fireplug energy as Carnahan, a smuggler and former friend to Royer. And it was Royer who misused the trust they shared in order to get a story published. The same story that eventually landed him in a cell on Alcatraz Island. As you can imagine - there's no love loss between the two.Unfortunately for Royer, who wants to repair his sullied reputation, he makes an offhanded comment to his editor-in-chief about rubber that's likely hidden in the country. And that remark quickly spirals into a top secret meeting with some of the most important people on the west coast. And they have a proposal.Royer is going to have to request, beg if need be, for Carnahan's assistance. Not only is he the only American who knows Malaya like the back of his hand, but most importantly, still has all his underground contacts. Their offer: Freedom, a clean slate, and a nice chunk of gold bullion if the pair can smuggle rubber out. Will Carnahan forgive the man who betrayed him? And if he does, how do they propose sneaking out tons of raw product from underneath the noses of the occupational enemy forces?These two men will change the course of the war, but for completely different reasons. Royer to make up for his past indiscretions, Carnahan to rescue the only woman he has ever loved.My only complaint was that despite Jimmy receiving co-star billing, this was actually Spence's movie. Not that that's necessarily a bad thing. But it seems somewhat of a bait-n-switch since I expected a more balanced story.That minor criticism aside, a decent post-war drama that still plays well today.Movie Notes:- Until doing some basic research on this production, I had no idea this was Sidney Greenstreet's final screen performance. Although, I have to admit I wasn't surprised, you could see he was struggling. Still, that devious impish presence, the Machiavellian aura - the man still had it. Really miss him. He broke the mold and I have yet to see another like his presence in the many years since his passing, though John Hurtin certain rolescomes close.- The age difference between Tracy and Stewart was not that off in real-life, but on screen quite noticeable. Spence was already a spry old curmudgeon in his late forties, while Jimmy was still very youthful despite having reached chronological middle age. Unintentionally, it seemed less a tale of two former buddies and more old man & the pup.",3,Interesting WW2 Action Flick With A Memorable Reunion,1337817600,"05 24, 2012",2012,3948,"['Three', 'years', 'indelible', 'Wonderful', 'Life', 'brief', 'incredibly', 'enjoyable', 'reunion', 'Once', 'again', 'facing', 'off', 'other', 'Lionel', 'Barrymore', 'Jimmy', 'Stewart.But', 'time', 'love', 'part', 'Jimmy', 'less-than-reputable', 'character', 'name', 'John', 'Royer', 'Officially', 'newspaperman', 'unofficially', 'opportunist', 'willing', 'do', 'whatever', 'make', 'buck', 'different', 'dynamic', 'when', 'played', 'good', 'egg', 'George', 'Bailey', 'absolutely', 'loved', 'Even', 'supporting', 'role', 'film', 'scene', 'alone', 'made', 'purchase.It', 'January', '1942', 'month', 'Pearl', 'Harbor', 'war', 'effort', 'just', 'gearing', 'up.Interestingly', 'first', 'time', ""'ve"", 'screened', 'film', 'drive', 'obtain', 'rubber', 'war.All', 'wartime', 'critical', 'materials', 'were', 'given', 'up', 'troops', 'several', 'films', 'discuss/mention', 'sacrifices', 'metal', 'medicines', 'food', 'gas', 'families', 'being', 'given', 'weekly', 'ration', 'scripts', 'survive', 'barest', 'necessities', 'rubber', 'one', 'rarely', 'mentioned', 'even', 'played', 'huge', 'part', 'homefront', 'war', 'effort', 'advent', 'mass', 'produceable', 'synthetic', 'rubber', 'only', 'way', 'obtain', 'extremely', 'critical', 'compound', 'was', 'rubber', 'tree', 'trees', 'do', ""n't"", 'grow', 'North', 'America', 'fact', 'almost', 'entire', 'industry', 'early', 'part', '20th', 'century', 'was', 'found', 'island', 'nation', 'Malaya', 'what', 'know', 'Malaysia', 'today', '1942', 'was', 'completely', 'overrun', 'invading', 'Imperial', 'Japanese', 'forces.Spencer', 'Tracy', 'usual', 'fireplug', 'energy', 'Carnahan', 'smuggler', 'former', 'friend', 'Royer', 'was', 'Royer', 'who', 'misused', 'trust', 'shared', 'order', 'get', 'story', 'published', 'same', 'story', 'eventually', 'landed', 'cell', 'Alcatraz', 'Island', 'can', 'imagine', 'love', 'loss', 'two.Unfortunately', 'Royer', 'who', 'repair', 'sullied', 'reputation', 'offhanded', 'comment', 'editor-in-chief', 'rubber', 'likely', 'hidden', 'country', 'remark', 'quickly', 'spirals', 'top', 'secret', 'meeting', 'most', 'important', 'people', 'west', 'coast', 'have', 'proposal.Royer', 'going', 'have', 'request', 'beg', 'need', 'be', 'Carnahan', 'assistance', 'Not', 'only', 'only', 'American', 'who', 'Malaya', 'back', 'hand', 'most', 'importantly', 'still', 'underground', 'contacts', 'offer', 'Freedom', 'clean', 'slate', 'nice', 'chunk', 'gold', 'bullion', 'pair', 'can', 'smuggle', 'rubber', 'out', 'Will', 'Carnahan', 'forgive', 'man', 'who', 'betrayed', 'how', 'do', 'propose', 'sneaking', 'out', 'tons', 'raw', 'product', 'noses', 'occupational', 'enemy', 'forces', 'two', 'men', 'will', 'change', 'course', 'war', 'completely', 'different', 'reasons', 'Royer', 'make', 'up', 'past', 'indiscretions', 'Carnahan', 'rescue', 'only', 'woman', 'ever', 'loved.My', 'only', 'complaint', 'was', 'Jimmy', 'receiving', 'co-star', 'billing', 'was', 'actually', 'Spence', 'movie', 'Not', 'necessarily', 'bad', 'thing', 'somewhat', 'bait-n-switch', 'expected', 'more', 'balanced', 'story.That', 'minor', 'criticism', 'aside', 'decent', 'post-war', 'drama', 'still', 'well', 'today.Movie', 'Notes', 'doing', 'basic', 'research', 'production', 'had', 'idea', 'was', 'Sidney', 'Greenstreet', 'final', 'screen', 'performance', 'have', 'admit', 'was', ""n't"", 'surprised', 'could', 'see', 'was', 'struggling', 'Still', 'devious', 'impish', 'presence', 'Machiavellian', 'aura', 'man', 'still', 'had', 'Really', 'miss', 'broke', 'mold', 'have', 'yet', 'see', 'presence', 'many', 'years', 'passing', 'John', 'Hurtin', 'certain', 'rolescomes', 'close.-', 'age', 'difference', 'Tracy', 'Stewart', 'was', 'not', 'off', 'real-life', 'screen', 'quite', 'noticeable', 'Spence', 'was', 'already', 'spry', 'old', 'curmudgeon', 'late', 'forties', 'Jimmy', 'was', 'still', 'very', 'youthful', 'having', 'reached', 'chronological', 'middle', 'age', 'Unintentionally', 'seemed', 'less', 'tale', 'two', 'former', 'buddies', 'more', 'old', 'man', 'pup']",Malaya VHS
355506,A1SVXJZ3386U2D,6303091997,Randy Keehn,"[15, 18]","With James Stewart and Spencer Tracy starring together, ""Malaya"" seemed a good bet to be a movie worth seeing.  It is a rather decent movie for its' time but there were some issues I had with its' factual content.  I mention that because the movie does a good job of dealing with an actual issue that existed during the war; the shortage of raw rubber.  If I'm not mistaken, the need for other habitats for the rubber plant (Brazil) and the development (out of necessity) for synthetic rubber, led to the eventual demise of the Southeast Asian rubber market.  However, that came later and, at the outset of WWII, Japanese control of the rubber producing area caused a critical shortage for the US and its' Allies.The objection I had with ""Malaya"" was the cosy relationship that existed in the Malayan setting between the Japanese, the Dutchman, and the Americans.  In case you missed any other clues that the US was already at war with Japan, Stewart's remark about his brother dying at Wake Island ought to have let you know that war was already underway.  The Dutchman, played with his usual excellence by Sidney Greenstreet, was just as much a target of the Japanese as the Americans.  The quick demise of The Netherlands in the initial days in Europe often obscures the role the Dutch soldiers played in the Pacific Theater of War.  So what?  Well, I had the feeling that ""Malaya"" was meant to be a cross between ""Casablanca"" and ""Across the Pacific"" with Sidney Greenstreet, rather than Humphrey Bogart, being the connection between the three movies.  However, this was not a neutral site to those involved and that kept me distracted throughout the bulk of the movie.Other than the probably overstated objection, the movie moves along well.  There's a lot of tough guys in this film including Gilbert Roland playing a person of Hispanic descent made up to look like a Frenchman.  (I guess that confused me as well).  Nonetheless, he did well in his schizophrenic role.Enjoy the movie and not the historical issues.  It's not one of Hollywood's classics by any means but it's still worth a look.",3,Casablanca in the Jungle,1156550400,"08 26, 2006",2006,2100,"['James', 'Stewart', 'Spencer', 'Tracy', 'starring', 'together', 'Malaya', 'seemed', 'good', 'bet', 'be', 'movie', 'seeing', 'rather', 'decent', 'movie', 'time', 'were', 'issues', 'had', 'factual', 'content', 'mention', 'movie', 'good', 'job', 'dealing', 'actual', 'issue', 'existed', 'war', 'shortage', 'raw', 'rubber', ""'m"", 'not', 'mistaken', 'need', 'other', 'habitats', 'rubber', 'plant', 'Brazil', 'development', 'necessity', 'synthetic', 'rubber', 'led', 'eventual', 'demise', 'Southeast', 'Asian', 'rubber', 'market', 'However', 'came', 'later', 'outset', 'WWII', 'Japanese', 'control', 'rubber', 'producing', 'area', 'caused', 'critical', 'shortage', 'US', 'Allies.The', 'objection', 'had', 'Malaya', 'was', 'cosy', 'relationship', 'existed', 'Malayan', 'setting', 'Japanese', 'Dutchman', 'Americans', 'case', 'missed', 'other', 'clues', 'US', 'was', 'already', 'war', 'Japan', 'Stewart', 'remark', 'brother', 'dying', 'Wake', 'Island', 'ought', 'have', 'let', 'know', 'war', 'was', 'already', 'underway', 'Dutchman', 'played', 'usual', 'excellence', 'Sidney', 'Greenstreet', 'was', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'target', 'Japanese', 'Americans', 'quick', 'demise', 'Netherlands', 'initial', 'days', 'Europe', 'often', 'role', 'Dutch', 'soldiers', 'played', 'Pacific', 'Theater', 'War', 'So', 'what', 'Well', 'had', 'feeling', 'Malaya', 'was', 'meant', 'be', 'cross', 'Casablanca', 'Pacific', 'Sidney', 'Greenstreet', 'rather', 'Humphrey', 'Bogart', 'being', 'connection', 'three', 'movies', 'However', 'was', 'not', 'neutral', 'site', 'involved', 'kept', 'distracted', 'bulk', 'movie.Other', 'probably', 'overstated', 'objection', 'movie', 'along', 'well', 'lot', 'tough', 'guys', 'film', 'including', 'Gilbert', 'Roland', 'playing', 'person', 'Hispanic', 'descent', 'made', 'up', 'look', 'Frenchman', 'guess', 'confused', 'well', 'Nonetheless', 'did', 'well', 'schizophrenic', 'role.Enjoy', 'movie', 'not', 'historical', 'issues', 'not', 'one', 'Hollywood', 'classics', 'means', 'still', 'worth', 'look']",Malaya VHS
