I bought and watched it and was very surprised: the movie is extremely, if not entirely accurate. The American media actors serve as a gateway to get the actual refuges to tell their story in a fluid manner, without getting the viewer detached from the movie. The movie takes a while to start, but once it does you might find yourself wanting it to stop. Remember though, it hasn't stopped in reality.The movie is brutal. The movie is genocide at its fullest. The few that go back to fight the Janjaweed serve as the American conscious: we want to kill the Janjaweed and save the people. The movie is more of a docudrama than anything in that it merely depicts a vicious attack of a town in Darfur, with some side notes about the AU's involvement and Al Bashir's involvement. Keep in mind that their are several rapes and several infanticides, but that is the state of things I am afraid.Good job Uwe Boll at telling the viewers what is going on in the world.

He goes from utterly abysmal video game adaptation fodder (House of the Dead, Alone in the Dark) to socially conscious shockers (Stoic, Rampage) in the blink of an eye.  Attack on Darfur, also known as simply Darfur (who knows why it was re-titled, or why the DVD cover makes it look like a lame action/thriller) follows a group of western journalists (among them Billy Zane, Kristanna Loken, Edward Furlong, David O'Hara, and Matt Frewer) on location in Darfur to document the atrocities and genocide taking place.  After witnessing it first hand, some decide to go back in an effort to help, and some don't.  Attack on Darfur is an uncompromising and unapologetic portrait of true horror, and it pulls no punches.

What this film depicts, how ever harsh and brutal it may be, is very much the truth. I have been an activist and involved in the Dardur conflict for awhile now and I can attest that much of that material presented in this film is far from fiction, it is reality has been happening for more than 7 years. The film presents a harsh and genuine depiction, and the work Boll has done while not perfect truly does tell an honest story about what happens in darfur every day. The Janjaweed rebels are even far more ruthless than this film really conveys. Its harsh and horrifying reality but sadly it is the truth. In this film two brave american journalists choose to give their lives in the name of what is the right thing to do in an attempt to save a small village of Sudanese blacks from being burned, mutliated and raped, and they gave their lives bravely in the process. Though there are minor weaknesses to this movie it really does tell the facts like they really are. And sad is it is to say, this movie is far easier to experience than what the reality of it is. Boll has certainly done his homework here because this movie is very accurate and realistic. Human beings are bombed, burned, dismembered and raped just like this every day in Darfur. I geuss the heroic attempts by these brave journalists is Bolls way of asking the question of what would happened if not just a few of us but perhaps thousands could do if we cared enough to give our lives to save the people of Darfur. The genocide in Darfur is truly the most serious issue in the world right now.

The movie is about a group of generic western journalists wanting to report on the genocide in Darfur.

The Arab Muslims known as the Janjaweed blame the West for the genocide because they (the West) want to give rights to black people.The journalists go into a village and interview the villagers so we get to know them. Then after they leave they espy the Janjaweed headed toward the village. Some of the reporters decide they need to go back and ""help.""

It is harrowing, but arguably a vital piece of cinema by virtue of the subject it is trying to bring to the Worlds attention, that is a civil war which has already cost 400,000 lives.The plot is quite basic in that a team of six journalists on a fact finding mission convince their African Union (AU) minders to let them visit a remote village in Janjaweed held territory. There they meet the villagers who tell them of the brutal realities of living in a country torn apart by conflict.They interview quite a few of the villagers and we get a glimpse into their lives and history as they tell real human stories that are easily relatable. One reporter comments that they seem almost proud of their historical inert tribal warfare.As they are leaving they spot a Janjaweed group racing toward the village, they feel if they return the threat of International journalists might convince the Janjaweed to move on and leave the village unharmed. Then they are faced with the reality of the brutal nature of these people who tell them to leave or they will be considered villagers.The Captain of the AU convinces them to make a hurried exit. However, the realization of what they are ignoring makes two of them return. The true horror of what the villagers had been telling them then unfolds.This is a gripping, brutal, explicitly violent (both physical and sexual) and harrowing film. It does not even pretend to pull its punches and has a clear message in that if we allow genocide to continue then we have not learnt from history. All of the actors are first rate (you really feel the children are mortified with fear) and the unsteady camera work gives it that urgency that one often gets from documentary.The Janjaweed storm around on horses and with four wheel drive flat bed trucks, a sort of marriage of the ancient and modern and as such sign posts the dichotomy that is modern Africa. They even try to explain the motivation of the Janjaweed in their callous hatred, but this film does not attempt to be balanced it is blatantly anti Janjaweed and does not attempt to deal with the question of where the causes of this conflict are except in pure racist terms, hence I have reposted this review and given 4 starts as to the previous 5 after a second viewing with friends.That said, whilst not for the faint hearted this film is a real must see.",4,Shocking and tragic,1306627200,"05 29, 2011",2011,2467,"['Someone', 'else', 'said', 'will', 'not', 'enjoy', 'film', 'entirely', 'concur', 'however', 'not', 'reason', 'avoid', 'harrowing', 'arguably', 'vital', 'piece', 'cinema', 'virtue', 'subject', 'trying', 'bring', 'Worlds', 'attention', 'civil', 'war', 'already', 'cost', '400,000', 'lives.The', 'plot', 'quite', 'basic', 'team', 'six', 'journalists', 'fact', 'finding', 'mission', 'convince', 'African', 'Union', 'AU', 'minders', 'let', 'visit', 'remote', 'village', 'Janjaweed', 'held', 'territory', 'meet', 'villagers', 'who', 'tell', 'brutal', 'realities', 'living', 'country', 'torn', 'apart', 'conflict.They', 'interview', 'quite', 'few', 'villagers', 'get', 'glimpse', 'lives', 'history', 'tell', 'real', 'human', 'stories', 'are', 'easily', 'relatable', 'One', 'reporter', 'comments', 'seem', 'almost', 'proud', 'historical', 'inert', 'tribal', 'warfare.As', 'are', 'leaving', 'spot', 'Janjaweed', 'group', 'racing', 'village', 'feel', 'return', 'threat', 'International', 'journalists', 'might', 'convince', 'Janjaweed', 'move', 'leave', 'village', 'unharmed', 'Then', 'are', 'faced', 'reality', 'brutal', 'nature', 'people', 'who', 'tell', 'leave', 'will', 'be', 'considered', 'villagers.The', 'Captain', 'AU', 'make', 'hurried', 'exit', 'However', 'realization', 'what', 'are', 'ignoring', 'two', 'return', 'true', 'horror', 'what', 'villagers', 'had', 'been', 'telling', 'then', 'gripping', 'brutal', 'explicitly', 'violent', 'physical', 'sexual', 'harrowing', 'film', 'not', 'even', 'pretend', 'pull', 'punches', 'clear', 'message', 'allow', 'genocide', 'continue', 'then', 'have', 'not', 'learnt', 'history', 'actors', 'are', 'first', 'rate', 'really', 'feel', 'children', 'are', 'mortified', 'fear', 'unsteady', 'camera', 'work', 'urgency', 'one', 'often', 'documentary.The', 'Janjaweed', 'storm', 'around', 'horses', 'four', 'wheel', 'drive', 'flat', 'bed', 'trucks', 'sort', 'marriage', 'ancient', 'modern', 'such', 'sign', 'dichotomy', 'modern', 'Africa', 'even', 'try', 'explain', 'motivation', 'Janjaweed', 'callous', 'hatred', 'film', 'not', 'attempt', 'be', 'balanced', 'blatantly', 'anti', 'Janjaweed', 'not', 'attempt', 'deal', 'question', 'where', 'causes', 'conflict', 'are', 'pure', 'racist', 'terms', 'hence', 'have', 'reposted', 'review', 'given', '4', 'starts', 'previous', '5', 'second', 'viewing', 'said', 'whilst', 'not', 'faint', 'hearted', 'film', 'real', 'must', 'see']",N/A
