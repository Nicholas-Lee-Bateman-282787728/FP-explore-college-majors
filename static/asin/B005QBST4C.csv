1497391,A13ECO05S0YUCY,B005QBST4C,1981bendover,"[4, 6]","Porkchop is a new slasher movie that pays homage to slasher classics like Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Friday the 13th. Unfortunately, despite some cool moments here and there and a few laughs, it is lacking. The killer in this one wears a pig mask, and he is an awesome killer. The trouble is that he really doesn't get that much screen time. There is some decent gore, but some of the deaths aren't that great. And I was expecting more humor than I got, being that this is supposed to be a satire. Don't expect the brilliant silliness of Caesar And Otto's Summer Camp Massacre. The movie does have some T & A, and even some brief male nudity for the ladies and gay men. Porkchop is okay, but it could have been so much more.",3,"Not As ""80's Style"" As It Thinks It Is",1323561600,"12 11, 2011",2011,725,"['Porkchop', 'new', 'slasher', 'movie', 'homage', 'slasher', 'classics', 'Texas', 'Chainsaw', 'Massacre', 'Friday', '13th', 'Unfortunately', 'cool', 'moments', 'here', 'there', 'few', 'laughs', 'lacking', 'killer', 'one', 'pig', 'mask', 'awesome', 'killer', 'trouble', 'really', ""n't"", 'get', 'that', 'much', 'screen', 'time', 'decent', 'gore', 'deaths', 'are', ""n't"", 'great', 'was', 'expecting', 'more', 'humor', 'got', 'being', 'supposed', 'be', 'satire', 'Do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'brilliant', 'silliness', 'Caesar', 'Otto', 'Summer', 'Camp', 'Massacre', 'movie', 'have', 'T', 'A', 'even', 'brief', 'male', 'nudity', 'ladies', 'gay', 'men', 'Porkchop', 'okay', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'much', 'more']",Porkchop

But  never in my day was there a cardboard robot dropping bad one liners, fake british guys who are just so annoying you pray for there death a stooped killer bad effects horrible acting and s***ty directing. This film is a waist of time and as a long time lover of slasher films, trust me ive seen them all and this is easily one of the worst. It makes ""Killer Workout"" seem like a piece of gold. I don't think the guy that made this film was old enough to really understand the 80s mind set. He basically took every stereo type and tossed it in a really stooped film. I guess in his mind the 80 was all day glow and synth pop shirtless girls woods that are .....just woods; i don't know how long i can keep reviewing this film it is making me think about it to much and that is stressing me out . Ok, so ill do a quick list as to why this film sucks.1."" The woods"". now if your setting a film, a horror film a SLASHER film in the woods you have to pick woods with personality, or at least dense enough to look creepy dark cluttered so its hard for the victims to run through not a pile of sticks that anyone can get out of or see what is coming.2.""The robot"" I understand that it seemed funny when smoking pot with your buds because there were quite a few robot films in the 80s but if your going to blend genres please do it well and make the robot look like a robot not cardboard. and rethink the one liners and the idea that a robot can have sex a feel pleasure please, your getting into dumb territory why you didn't see that i don't know.3. ""the Killer"" There is such a small back story as to why it kills that it doesn't even need to be there, something about a childhood in a slaughterhouse ""Texas Chainsaw"" A history of brutal killings ""every film ever made"". See wear i am going with this.4. "" the pig mask"" Motel Hell, if you know your 80s films like you say you do you would know that the pig head was used in motel hell and to iconic degrees. Things like a hockey mask come on man cant copy classic films with out real 80s fans calling you on it.5. ""Boobs"" ok ill give that one to ya there were allot of boobs and you can never go wrong with boobs in a slasher film.So basically i didn't even get to the horrible plot the bad fake british guy the annoying ""and not in a funny good way"" kids, the bad special effects bla bla bla , you get the point, it looks like it was shot on a cheep vhs camera which has a certain charm to it but this film production wise seems to take itself to seriously for that so there is no depth to the film rather it looks cold and cheep.Just avoid this crap and call it a day.",1,NOT MY 80s,1359244800,"01 27, 2013",2013,2799,"['play', 'up', 'whole', '80s', 'vibe', 'promotion', 'film', 'NOTHING', '80s', 'film', 'woods', 'woods', 'look', 'probably', 'backyard', 'never', 'day', 'was', 'there', 'cardboard', 'robot', 'dropping', 'bad', 'one', 'liners', 'fake', 'british', 'guys', 'who', 'are', 'just', 'so', 'annoying', 'pray', 'death', 'stooped', 'killer', 'bad', 'effects', 'horrible', 'acting', 's***ty', 'directing', 'film', 'waist', 'time', 'long', 'time', 'lover', 'slasher', 'films', 'trust', 'ive', 'seen', 'easily', 'one', 'worst', 'Killer', 'Workout', 'seem', 'piece', 'gold', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'guy', 'made', 'film', 'was', 'old', 'enough', 'really', 'understand', '80s', 'mind', 'set', 'basically', 'took', 'stereo', 'type', 'tossed', 'really', 'stooped', 'film', 'guess', 'mind', '80', 'was', 'day', 'glow', 'synth', 'pop', 'shirtless', 'girls', 'woods', 'are', '..just', 'woods', 'i', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'long', 'i', 'can', 'keep', 'reviewing', 'film', 'making', 'think', 'much', 'stressing', 'Ok', 'so', 'ill', 'do', 'quick', 'list', 'why', 'film', 'sucks.1', 'woods', 'now', 'setting', 'film', 'horror', 'film', 'SLASHER', 'film', 'woods', 'have', 'pick', 'woods', 'personality', 'least', 'dense', 'enough', 'look', 'creepy', 'dark', 'cluttered', 'so', 'hard', 'victims', 'run', 'not', 'pile', 'sticks', 'anyone', 'can', 'get', 'see', 'what', 'coming.2', 'robot', 'understand', 'seemed', 'funny', 'when', 'smoking', 'pot', 'buds', 'were', 'quite', 'few', 'robot', 'films', '80s', 'going', 'blend', 'genres', 'please', 'do', 'well', 'make', 'robot', 'look', 'robot', 'not', 'cardboard', 'rethink', 'one', 'liners', 'idea', 'robot', 'can', 'have', 'sex', 'feel', 'pleasure', 'please', 'getting', 'dumb', 'territory', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'i', 'do', ""n't"", 'know.3', 'Killer', 'such', 'small', 'back', 'story', 'why', ""n't"", 'even', 'need', 'be', 'there', 'something', 'childhood', 'slaughterhouse', 'Texas', 'Chainsaw', 'A', 'history', 'brutal', 'killings', 'film', 'ever', 'made', 'See', 'wear', 'i', 'am', 'going', 'this.4.', 'pig', 'mask', 'Motel', 'Hell', 'know', '80s', 'films', 'say', 'do', 'would', 'know', 'pig', 'head', 'was', 'used', 'motel', 'hell', 'iconic', 'degrees', 'Things', 'hockey', 'mask', 'come', 'man', 'cant', 'copy', 'classic', 'films', 'out', 'real', '80s', 'fans', 'calling', 'it.5', 'Boobs', 'ok', 'ill', 'give', 'one', 'ya', 'were', 'allot', 'boobs', 'can', 'never', 'go', 'wrong', 'boobs', 'slasher', 'film.So', 'basically', 'i', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'get', 'horrible', 'plot', 'bad', 'fake', 'british', 'guy', 'annoying', 'not', 'funny', 'good', 'way', 'kids', 'bad', 'special', 'effects', 'bla', 'bla', 'bla', 'get', 'point', 'was', 'shot', 'cheep', 'vhs', 'camera', 'certain', 'charm', 'film', 'production', 'wise', 'take', 'seriously', 'so', 'depth', 'film', 'rather', 'cold', 'cheep.Just', 'avoid', 'crap', 'call', 'day']",Porkchop
1497402,A1PLVSI37Y3YFM,B005QBST4C,William D Wolford,"[1, 2]","Well, I'd been kind of looking forward to seeing this movie, as it had a cool hand drawn cover of the title character and the tagline bragged of 80's style horror. I was really hoping that I'd have some fun with this film, so I decided to pop it in tonight and see what it was all about. Well, what it seemed to be all about was breaking the cardinal rule of low budget horror films: Do Not Be Boring!Porkchop is a no-budget movie shot on video, and it starts off terribly with an awful heavy metal tune titled ""Porkchop"" running over the opening credits of real footage of pigs being butchered in a slaughterhouse. As far as disturbing, or gross, this would be the highlight of the film.It's the classic tale of getting a group of buddies together to go on a camping trip out in the woods where a rural legend just happens to still be around. We have six ""buddies"", and one robot. You heard me right, a robot is among the cast for the entire movie, spouting off terrible one liners and being the most annoying of all of the annoying characters in the movie. That's another big no-no that this movie has in store for us. There is not one character to root for in the film. Not one of them would we miss if they ended up on the end of Porkchop's chainsaw. The only thing that seemed to matter to me was hoping that all of the female characters got topless at least once. That one wish was almost fulfilled, as our lead female character does not lose her clothes during the film.There were some characters that were so bad at acting that I wondered if there was even a script being used at some points. Some of the lines being read, or made up were so poorly acted that I wanted to hide my face in shame for them. I sure hope they got paid well, but somehow I doubt it. Taking a camera into the woods, and filming your friends trying to do scary things can be fun for the people doing it, but not always fun for the people that get to watch what you've made out of it.The film had no sense of urgency, no atmosphere, no tension, and worst of all, no action at all until the one hour mark. Any attempts among the characters to make any type of jokes or humor fall completely flat. The only interesting time I had was during the campfire scene when the legend of Porkchop was told. It seemed to be the only part of the movie that drew me in for a few minutes, and was quickly discarded as the characters reverted back to their boring nature after that one scene was completed. No matter how many times the actors referenced different 80's icons, it did not look or feel anything like an 80's film like it had been advertised as. And seeing female teenage (supposedly) characters with tattoos and tramp stamps didn't help create any 80's vibe either.Yes, this film was a disappointment for a lot of reasons. As little as I could let myself get into the film, I still saw mistakes that the filmmakers must have seen themselves and didn't want to, or couldn't afford to fix. A girl has no flashlight in one scene, then suddenly she has one in the next. Even so bad as to start a kill with a long handled buzz saw, and finish the scene with the killer holding a chainsaw. Inexcusable.
