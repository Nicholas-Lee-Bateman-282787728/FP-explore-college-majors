Rocky grabs this other teenager and slams him against the lockers replying, ""I'll take of my mask when you take off yours"" and that's one of the coolest lines I ever heard in a movie.If you have a narcissistic or low self-esteem person in your life or anybody that feels sorry for themself too much have them watch MASK (not THE MASK). The acting is great. Cher is Rocky's mother, Sam Elliot is Cher's biker boyfriend and Eric Stoltz is Rocky. Peter Bogdanovich directed.

204570,A4PTUEVFE13K6,6300184080,Allen Chapman,"[77, 85]","This new directors cut of ""Mask"" blows away the orginal DVD release. I'm not going to go on about how great the movie is, by now everyone already knows that. I will talk about this edition however. First of all the print is far clearer and more crisp than the original DVD issue. Next of course is the inclusion of the original Bruce Springsteen soundtrack which was recorded but never used in the theatrical and home video releases. In it's place was a Bob Seger soundtrack which was great, but not the original choice. The movie was shot with Springsteen in mind and in fact Rocky has a Springsteen poster hanging in his room. But Bruce is back and used to great effect. His music was used to set a timeline which was lost when the Seger songs were used.Also included are 8 mins of deleted scenes that have been edited back into the film. One of these scenes (which was sort of referred to in the theatrical version) is a song sung by Rusty (Cher) and Rocky (Eric Stoltz). The song is ""Little Egypt"" and the scene runs about 4 mins. The other scene is one where one of the bikers dies and his funeral, again this was never before seen.And finally, there is an easter egg of sorts, at the very end of credits, after a minute or two, Cher comes on screen and speaks about the craniofacial disease and how you can help.I've always loved the Seger music in the film, particularly ""Roll Me Away"" at the end. But the Springsteen music works very well too, and as I said, is used as a timeline.Director Peter Bogdonovich does a commentary as well as a 20 min interview about the movie.

204575,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6300184080,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","`Mask' is the type of film that moves you to tears.  It is genuinely sweet and sincere and heartbreaking as well as heartwarming.  It is true that the film can, at times, feel forced and manipulative, but who doesn't like having their feelings manipulated in this manner.  The true story of Rocky Dennis is inspirational and poignant and one that we all should take to heart; and `Mask' gives us the opportunity to do just that.The film recounts the final year of Rocky's life.  Growing up with a rare disease (craniodiaphyseal dysplasia) was not easy for Rocky, but with the support from his very strong and very loving mother Rusty, Rocky was able to make it through.  Teased by other kids and humiliated by teachers, Rocky learned at a young age to form a thick skin, and his mother's defensive and free-spirited attitude helped Rocky to realize that he was no different than anyone else and thus didn't deserve to be treated differently.  The film also portrays Rocky's relationship with his mother and his struggle to clean her up (she was heavy into drugs and this caused problems between her and Rocky).  He was a very strong boy, a very stable force in his mother's life and he made a huge impact on all who came in contact with him.Like I mentioned, the film is at times quite manipulative.  It is a dramatized account of the real Rocky Dennis's life, but that is to be expected.  It falls into the clich&eacute;d family/drama moments (the aggravated confrontation that leads to a regretful slapping of a child...the conveniently placed shelf of beer mugs prime for smashing in a fit of emotional rage) and while these moments are unnecessary, I'd be lying if I said they weren't effective.What is necessary and equally effective is the acting, which is, for the most part, outstanding.  Reportedly Cher was quite upset that her performance was not recognized by Oscar.  That in itself seems pretty presumptuous, since to expect you will be Oscar nominated is rather arrogant; but then I saw her performance and quite honestly, it was better than half the nominees.  As Rusty, Cher is above and beyond outstanding.  She emulates every raw and passionate emotion rolling through this woman's body.  She captures the love, the fear, the depression, the pride; everything this woman stood for is presented for us accurately.  Eric Stoltz has a tough job of acting through makeup, which means that he has to do a lot more with his eyes than under normal circumstances.  Many have praised him for his portrayal of Rocky, and I will not knock him, but in all honesty, to me, he was the weakest link here.  I was more moved by Cher's portrayal of his mother than I was of Stoltz performance; but that is just me.  Sam Elliott is strong as the father figure in his life; Gar, and Laura Dern has a beautifully sincere turn as Diana, the blind girl who falls in love with Rocky.The film is touching, as to be expected, and in all its `Ron Howardesque' ways it manages to choke out the cry-baby in all of us.  `Mask' is a very tender film that tells a very beautiful story of love and strength and the power to overcome all obstacles presented before us.  Rocky was born with a deficiency but he never allowed that to factor into his life.  He lived each and every day to the fullest, and that is an inspiration for all of us, especially those of us who tend to take life for granted.",4,A truly inspirational story...,1225929600,"11 6, 2008",2008,3382,"['Mask', 'type', 'film', 'tears', 'genuinely', 'sweet', 'sincere', 'heartbreaking', 'as', 'well', 'heartwarming', 'true', 'film', 'can', 'times', 'feel', 'forced', 'manipulative', 'who', ""n't"", 'like', 'having', 'feelings', 'manipulated', 'manner', 'true', 'story', 'Rocky', 'Dennis', 'inspirational', 'poignant', 'one', 'should', 'take', 'heart', 'Mask', 'opportunity', 'do', 'just', 'that.The', 'film', 'recounts', 'final', 'year', 'Rocky', 'life', 'Growing', 'up', 'rare', 'disease', 'craniodiaphyseal', 'dysplasia', 'was', 'not', 'easy', 'Rocky', 'support', 'very', 'strong', 'very', 'loving', 'mother', 'Rusty', 'Rocky', 'was', 'able', 'make', 'Teased', 'other', 'kids', 'humiliated', 'teachers', 'Rocky', 'learned', 'young', 'age', 'form', 'thick', 'skin', 'mother', 'defensive', 'free-spirited', 'attitude', 'helped', 'Rocky', 'realize', 'was', 'different', 'anyone', 'else', 'thus', 'did', ""n't"", 'deserve', 'be', 'treated', 'differently', 'film', 'also', 'Rocky', 'relationship', 'mother', 'struggle', 'clean', 'up', 'was', 'heavy', 'drugs', 'caused', 'problems', 'Rocky', 'was', 'very', 'strong', 'boy', 'very', 'stable', 'force', 'mother', 'life', 'made', 'huge', 'impact', 'who', 'came', 'contact', 'him.Like', 'mentioned', 'film', 'times', 'quite', 'manipulative', 'dramatized', 'account', 'real', 'Rocky', 'Dennis', 'life', 'be', 'expected', 'clich', 'eacute', 'family/drama', 'moments', 'aggravated', 'confrontation', 'regretful', 'slapping', 'child', 'conveniently', 'placed', 'shelf', 'beer', 'mugs', 'prime', 'smashing', 'fit', 'emotional', 'rage', 'moments', 'are', 'unnecessary', ""'d"", 'be', 'lying', 'said', 'were', ""n't"", 'effective.What', 'necessary', 'equally', 'effective', 'acting', 'most', 'part', 'outstanding', 'Reportedly', 'Cher', 'was', 'quite', 'upset', 'performance', 'was', 'not', 'recognized', 'Oscar', 'pretty', 'presumptuous', 'expect', 'will', 'be', 'Oscar', 'nominated', 'rather', 'arrogant', 'then', 'saw', 'performance', 'quite', 'honestly', 'was', 'better', 'nominees', 'Rusty', 'Cher', 'outstanding', 'raw', 'passionate', 'emotion', 'rolling', 'woman', 'body', 'love', 'fear', 'depression', 'pride', 'everything', 'woman', 'stood', 'presented', 'accurately', 'Eric', 'Stoltz', 'tough', 'job', 'acting', 'makeup', 'do', 'lot', 'more', 'eyes', 'normal', 'circumstances', 'Many', 'have', 'praised', 'portrayal', 'Rocky', 'will', 'not', 'knock', 'honesty', 'was', 'weakest', 'link', 'here', 'was', 'more', 'moved', 'Cher', 'portrayal', 'mother', 'was', 'Stoltz', 'performance', 'just', 'Sam', 'Elliott', 'strong', 'father', 'figure', 'life', 'Gar', 'Laura', 'Dern', 'beautifully', 'sincere', 'turn', 'Diana', 'blind', 'girl', 'who', 'love', 'Rocky.The', 'film', 'touching', 'be', 'expected', 'Ron', 'Howardesque', 'ways', 'choke', 'out', 'cry-baby', 'Mask', 'very', 'tender', 'film', 'very', 'beautiful', 'story', 'love', 'strength', 'power', 'overcome', 'obstacles', 'presented', 'Rocky', 'was', 'born', 'deficiency', 'never', 'allowed', 'factor', 'life', 'lived', 'day', 'fullest', 'inspiration', 'especially', 'who', 'tend', 'take', 'life', 'granted']",N/A

Mask is a beautiful, moving film with a surprise but somber ending. The performances by everybody are top-notch with the real winners in Cher and Eric Stoltz. Although Laura Dern did an excellent job playing the blind character, I just find it a bit insulting to see why they couldn't get somebody else who is actually blind to play the role. A couple of firsts for the film are as follows. This is the first film ever to win the Academy Award for Best Makeup. This was a richly deserved award because when you think about it, you would want the character with a deformed face to speak without the face crumbling apart, a first ever technique. Secondlly, Mask is the first film ever with Bruce Springsteen songs although they weren't used until twenty years later in a Director's Cut edition. All in all, Mask is an outstanding film.

E Jackson,"[0, 1]","What mainly makes Mask such a classic is the fact that the actor who plays the teenager in the film with the unusual Mask disease opened millions of peoples eyes on this very rare and devastating disease that's unfortunately very real.  Back in the mid 80's the disease only affected about 22 million people in the world, but who knows if that number has increased or decreased today.This story will touch you on many unexplainable levels because you begin to feel compassion for people who have to suffer with the disease while getting to know Eric Stoltz's character develop, and you will even begin to see that people who have to deal with the disease can be just like you and me, if you're willing to get over how they look and just accept them as normal people.In the case of Eric Stoltz's character with the Mask disease (based on a true story of someone who really had the disease and died in 1978) you will see how intelligent he was, how easy it was for people to fall in love with him because of his likeable personality, and you will even see how brave he is, and how he doesn't get annoyed or take it personally when someone makes fun of how he looks.  When you consider all these things, you begin to realize how most everyday people aren't able to measure up because most normal people (including me) sometimes tend to take unimportant things seriously that mean absolutely nothing in the grand scheme of things.  The person who suffered with the Mask disease was all about having fun, living life, and not letting a horrible disease get in the way of his dreams.So Mask is a terrific movie with an award-winning performance by Cher and Eric Stoltz.  It doesn't even matter if you don't care for Cher's music- it's her performance that really strikes you hard and makes you a fan of her acting abiliities.

Wonderfully moving true story of Rocky Dennis, a young man suffering from a disfiguring disease, and the immesurable courage he displayed. This film will make most of us, with our daily &quot;problems&quot;, feel like the superficial, shallow, self-pitying , contemptuous, overly image -conscious, ungrateful beings that some of us (I'm just as guilty) often are. Cher is miraculous in this film, playing the all too human, but ultimatley incredibly brave Rusty, Rocky's mother. She gives a performance that, in its' &quot;reality&quot;, is second to almost none of recent memory. Equally moving is Eric Stoltz as Rocky, the young man who does not let the cruelty that we humans sometimes inflict upon each other for being &quot;different&quot; get in the way of his experiencing the already elusive joys of life and love. His &quot;Rocky&quot; displays more courage, insight, and forgiveness than most of us could conjure up under the best of conditions. I truly feel the players were guided by the spirit of Rocky, and, in that, were dedicated in letting his incredible spirit and bravery  shine through, without them being overly self-absorbed about giving a great &quot;performance&quot;. And it shows, as here, they are all at their best.  Just a superb movie about a superb human being who wasn't here for long, but who's life taught many. I have actually popped in this film when feeling in need of an attitude adjustment after drowning in pools of self-pity. It always works. Try it the next time you're cursing the heavens for that zit on the end of your nose. Most movies are merely entertaining, at best.(Even that's becoming a rarity.) But it's not often that a movie is not only a flawlessly  crafted entertainment experience  but, also, a sometimes life altering lesson. &quot;Mask&quot; is such a film.

But instead of having a low sense of self, he is surrounded by people who love him. The day he enters into a new school, his mother and the gang accompany him. At first he is afraid, but the support he has from his mother (played by Cher)is more than enough to get him through. He is a bright kid who has street sense and a kind heart.You know what is going to happen and the morning Cher comes into his room to wake him for school, only the most coldhearted can hold back the tears. This movie is about the love of life and how powerful support from peers and family can be. But this kid's handicap can nowhere compare with that of black kids who are castigated and locked out simply becuase of skin color. As a teacher myself, I recommend this movie to middle school kids as part of their ""ethnic studies"" requirement.

And the tears ended up tripping me - this is another film that I can add to my &quot;Films I Cry At&quot; list. My mum grabbed it, as she loves true stories, and it's not a film I will ever watch again - I hate crying at films!!! It's only a story is what I keep getting told, but it doesn't work.

The Cher gave when she found Eric Stoltz had died in his sleep, was almost too realistic.Cher gives a great performance in this movie. It's one of the very rare movies where she isn't wooden - although she does advertise her plastic surgeon a lot. This is a movie to watch purely for Cher, to see her before she overdone the plastic surgery, and is does a farewell tour every couple of years.Eric Stoltz is unrecognisable in his role of Rocky.

they lack the understanding of the afflications and suffering of their fellow humans.Rocky Dennis was an individual to admire,love,and be inspired by.Eric Stolz is a stellar actor whom I feel put his heart and soul into the portrayal of Rocky.He is one of my favorites along with Sam Elliott and Cher.Sam Elliott,perfect in the role of Gar,is a excellent father figure and has never disappointed with his acting talent.I've loved every film he has done.It's hard to nail down which film is his best,but I think this film should definitely be considered for him receiving an oscar.Cher,whom I've loved since her days with the ""Sonny and Cher""show has definitely reached far beyond her talent into the acting realm ,and has not only achieved great fame as a singer and performer in concerts,but knocked fans out with her many great films.She is also a huge talent and success as a actress.This film,where she portrays Rocky Dennis mother,is very well done,she really gets into every role she takes on.Rusty Dennis had a big heart full of love and hope for her son Rocky.It was a moving experience because Cher played the role,and did it well.This film is definitely one of Cher's best.I hope that anyone who watches this film,isn't just entertained,but deeply moved and inspired as I have been.The music of Bob Seger and Bruce Springsteen makes the impact of the film even stronger.I,by the

204641,A2NX5UZ6WEZF0R,6300184080,Movie Fan,"[0, 0]","My 10th grade english teacher told his class a story about one of his students who was in a serious car accident leaving him clinging to life and when he did survive, leaving him severely disfigured. The main thing he wanted was to go back to school, to be with friends, and live his life again. It was a sad story that our teacher told us while he choked up because he was close to this student. The student died at only age 16. As we were told the story, we thought of this movie, called the mask. The difference was, the boy in mask had a rare, unpredictable, and incurable disease. Also a true story, mask is a moving and heart-wrenching tearjerker that is good for children to watch as well as adults. It's a life lesson to appreciate what you have, and to not discriminate against others because no one is perfect. Kids can be brutally cruel and it is hard enough being a teenager and dealing with everyday problems like peer pressure, acceptance, fitting in, meeting girls etc. But to also have an extremely noticeable disfigurement and to deal with teasing and staring, and laughing, it almost seems unbearable to endure. But this boy was stronger than most, and seemed used to people's ignorance, but of course not completely unphased. I.E. When he finally falls in love with a blind girl from a summer camp, and after they all go home his calls to her are ignored. He later finds out that her parents want her to have nothing to do with him. They too, were prejudice against him which is a bit baffling considering most parents of blind children are more compassionate because they raise their children to overcome obstacles and discrimination for their disability.

204642,A2XRZV63X79YSJ,6300184080,"Movie Mania ""DVD Collector""","[7, 9]","This is a review for the Director's Cut Widescreen EditionMask deals with the last two years of the life of Rocky Dennis.  Rocky was stricken with a disease that builds up calcium deposits on the skull, deforming the face.  While it has deformed his face, it has not changed anything else, including his spirit.The doctors are always doom and gloom but as Rusty puts it, if I started to dig a grave every time a doctor told me Rocky was going to die, I'd be eating chow mien right now!Rocky (Eric Stoltz) is about to start his last year in junior high school.  It is a new school and the principal does not want him there.  But mom, Rusty (Cher), already has that covered.  What the principal doesn't know is that Rocky is extremely bright and despite his disease, he makes friends easily.Rusty was a stereotypical biker babe of the 70's.  She was hard drinking and a drug addict.  Neither of these pleased Rocky.  In comes, old flame Gar (Sam Elliot).  Gar is definitely more centered than Rusty.  He understands what Rocky has been through and is there for him.Rusty graduates junior high school with honors and the principal arranges a scholarship at a summer camp for the blind.  At the camp he meets a beautiful blind girl, Anne (Laura Dern).  She knows that he is not normal but sees the perfect soul not the imperfect face.  The camp ends and Rusty meets the parents and of course, they are not pleased.  But when he is picked up by the crew, Rusty announces that she is clean and sober.Rocky starts High School with the usual complications.  But once again he overcomes them.  But his personal life has taken a turn for the worse.  His best friend is moving in with his father back east and is not going to Europe with Rocky.  Also, Anne's mother has prevented him from contacting her.  He finally tracks Anne down only to find out that she is being sent to a special school.With all things handed to Rocky he overcomes the disappointments.  But the doctor's predictions finally come true and Rocky succumbs to the disease.This is a film with a lot of heart and soul.  This is a film about the human spirit and the adversities that God gives us.  Cher won the Cannes Film Festival Best Actress Award.  She should have won an Oscar.  Both Stoltz and Elliott give well faceted and finely layered performances.  This is Bogdonovich's best film since The Last Picture Show.This is a director's cut and includes two scenes that the studio removed and restored the Springsteen songs that were removed before its opening.  This only makes a great film better.DVD EXTRAS:Commentary by Peter BogdonovichMask Revisited: A Conversation with Peter Bogdonovich - A 25 minute featurette where Bogdonovich talks about the making of the film from the origins to the final cut.",5,Brilliance with a Heart,1149984000,"06 11, 2006",2006,2768,"['review', 'Director', 'Cut', 'Widescreen', 'EditionMask', 'deals', 'last', 'two', 'years', 'life', 'Rocky', 'Dennis', 'Rocky', 'was', 'stricken', 'disease', 'up', 'calcium', 'deposits', 'skull', 'deforming', 'face', 'deformed', 'face', 'not', 'changed', 'anything', 'else', 'including', 'spirit.The', 'doctors', 'are', 'always', 'doom', 'gloom', 'Rusty', 'started', 'dig', 'grave', 'time', 'doctor', 'told', 'Rocky', 'was', 'going', 'die', ""'d"", 'be', 'eating', 'chow', 'mien', 'right', 'now', 'Rocky', 'Eric', 'Stoltz', 'start', 'last', 'year', 'junior', 'high', 'school', 'new', 'school', 'principal', 'not', 'want', 'there', 'mom', 'Rusty', 'Cher', 'already', 'covered', 'What', 'principal', ""n't"", 'know', 'Rocky', 'extremely', 'bright', 'disease', 'friends', 'easily.Rusty', 'was', 'stereotypical', 'biker', 'babe', '70', 'was', 'hard', 'drinking', 'drug', 'addict', 'pleased', 'Rocky', 'old', 'flame', 'Gar', 'Sam', 'Elliot', 'Gar', 'definitely', 'more', 'centered', 'Rusty', 'what', 'Rocky', 'been', 'there', 'him.Rusty', 'graduates', 'junior', 'high', 'school', 'honors', 'principal', 'scholarship', 'summer', 'camp', 'blind', 'camp', 'beautiful', 'blind', 'girl', 'Anne', 'Laura', 'Dern', 'not', 'normal', 'perfect', 'soul', 'not', 'imperfect', 'face', 'camp', 'Rusty', 'parents', 'course', 'are', 'not', 'pleased', 'when', 'picked', 'up', 'crew', 'Rusty', 'clean', 'sober.Rocky', 'starts', 'High', 'School', 'usual', 'complications', 'once', 'again', 'personal', 'life', 'taken', 'turn', 'worse', 'best', 'friend', 'moving', 'father', 'back', 'east', 'not', 'going', 'Europe', 'Rocky', 'Also', 'Anne', 'mother', 'prevented', 'contacting', 'finally', 'Anne', 'down', 'only', 'find', 'out', 'being', 'sent', 'special', 'school.With', 'things', 'handed', 'Rocky', 'disappointments', 'doctor', 'predictions', 'finally', 'come', 'true', 'Rocky', 'succumbs', 'disease.This', 'film', 'lot', 'heart', 'soul', 'film', 'human', 'spirit', 'adversities', 'God', 'Cher', 'won', 'Cannes', 'Film', 'Festival', 'Best', 'Actress', 'Award', 'should', 'have', 'won', 'Oscar', 'Stoltz', 'Elliott', 'give', 'well', 'faceted', 'finely', 'layered', 'performances', 'Bogdonovich', 'best', 'film', 'Last', 'Picture', 'Show.This', 'director', 'cut', 'two', 'scenes', 'studio', 'removed', 'restored', 'Springsteen', 'songs', 'were', 'removed', 'opening', 'only', 'great', 'film', 'better.DVD', 'EXTRAS', 'Commentary', 'Peter', 'BogdonovichMask', 'Revisited', 'Conversation', 'Peter', 'Bogdonovich', '25', 'minute', 'featurette', 'where', 'Bogdonovich', 'making', 'film', 'origins', 'final', 'cut']",N/A

It's a wonderfully subtle tale of coming-of-age and triumphing over adversity, and one that nobody should go without seeing, at least once.Rusty Dennis (Cher) and her son Rocky (Eric Stoltz) are not your average family: she's a drug-abusing biker mom, and he's living with a medical condition that has deformed his skull and, by all medical accounts, should have killed him during childhood. Ferociously defensive and protective of her son, and when her old boyfriend Gar (Sam Elliot) returns, Rusty must deal as best she can when a series of events happen that force her to examine both her own life and that of her son: his graduation from junior high school, his first girlfriend Diana (Laura Dern) and his continued desire to look 'normal': he's growing up.The central performances from Cher and Stoltz are flawless and believable: even with the now-questionable looking makeup effects, theirs is still a convincing and thought-provoking relationship that forces the viewer to examine the traditional parent-child bond: while not the most responsible adult, Rusty's still a great mom - how can this be? And how comfortable do we feel with Rocky's constant desire to look different, or his seemingly 'easier' relationship with a girl who happens to be blind? The issue of the Urban Family is examined, too: Rusty's parents may have alienated her at a young age, and Rocky's father may be out of the picture, but how can they seem so content with the beer-swilling, joint-smoking Gar and his violent, layabout biker buddies? While the plot seems fairly simplistic to begin with, as the movie progresses, we find ourselves more and more challenged by the seeming straightforwardness of the situations: the mark of great actors and a truly great script.Direction is excellent: Bogdanovich is a real talent, and his unpretentious, pared-back, almost-amateurish style of filmmaking is the ideal compliment for this great, multi-layered story.This Director's Cut DVD is a wonderful option: the restored print is crisp and clean, and the extra scenes are a nice touch. Extras are pretty perfunctory, but Audio/Video quality is better than it's ever been.But none of those features are the reason for owning 'Mask' on DVD. Own it on any format you choose: this is a wonderfully clever, touching and masterfully-crafted piece of film.

204665,A1KB06BCT5NXYD,6300184080,Tigerlily,"[1, 1]","This is movie is based on a true story, and centers around Rocky Dennis, a 16 year old boy who was born with severe facial deformities. Since he was a child, doctors had been telling his mother, Rusty (Cher), that Rocky would never make it through the next year of his life. However, 16 years later, he was still proving them wrong.Rocky's mother is very protective and very devoted to him, even though her personal life isn't stable. Rusty runs with a wild bunch, and parties every night, and usually spends the night with a different man. Plus, she is a drug user. This in itself is a source of tension between she and Rocky. Yet they still love one another very much and would do anything for the other. In fact, Rusty has helped Rocky immensely when he gets one of his terrible headaches, which are a result of his deformity. Rather than resorting to medicine to cure the pain, Rusty manages to literally talk Rocky through it.Gar(Sam Elliott), an old flame of Rusty's, returns to the picture, and after time, they resume their old relationship. Gar has been like a father to Rocky over the years, and is basically the only good guy that has been in Rusty and Rocky's life.The movie follows the ups and downs of their life together, as Rusty continues to battle her addictions and Rocky enters the 9th grade. He is in a new school, and has to deal with the taunts of his new set of classmates. To make things harder, he develops a crush on a girl, knowing that she will never return his feelings because of how he looks.Despite the adversity, Rocky is the smartest kid in his classes and ends up making friends by tutoring one of the popular boys. After that, he is accepted a little bit more, and ends up befriending a few others.In this version, there is a new soundtrack, using Bruce Springsteen's songs, the way it was supposed to have been released all those years ago. There is also a new scene with Rusty and Rocky, where they are hanging out with Rusty's friends at a bonfire and Rusty and Rocky sing a rendition of 'Little Egypt'. This scene is true to life, and is something the real Rusty and Rocky used to do.Another added scene is after Red, one of the oldest in the gang, dies. They have a genuine bikers funeral for him, where his motorcycle is buried alongside of him, and they fire off handguns in salute.Eric Stoltz is great as Rocky. I am not really a fan of Eric's but in this movie he delivers. Cher is great also, and is perfect in her portrayal of a troubled mother battling her addictions and inner demons. It's probably my favorite role of hers. Sam Elliott exudes sex appeal as Gar, and you can see why Rusty was so hung up on him.I could go on and on about this movie, but then I'd end up relaying the whole thing. Suffice it to say, this is a really wonderful, sad movie.

The Academy would later make up for overlooking her in this film by presenting her the Best Actress Oscar for ""Moonstruck."" But it is in ""Mask,""where Cher proves her acting mettle.Cher acts and even looks the part of Rusty, the mother of a severely disfigure child; but that is almost a side note. What gives the film its ability to relate to its audience is the tension between this beleaguered woman and her on-again/off- again boyfriend Gar (Sam Elliot, delivering a subtly cool performance); and Rusty and her staunchly old-fashioned parents. Cher takes advantage of the opportunities to flaunt her acting chops without being over the top. It is here where she proves that she can more than hold her own against any of Hollywood's so-called A-list actresses.Eric Stolz plays Rocky Dennis (upon whom the story was based), and the chemistry between he and his older co-star is unmistakable. Their relationship comes off as real, without any of the parents vs. teenager cliches. Both Rocky and Rusty feel things deeply and it is that trait that binds them. Rusty is a single mother struggling with drug addiction, but never lets it get in the way of loving her child.Interesting contrast between Rocky's world and the world of the ""typical teen,"" so much so that you don't put Rocky nor feel a need to root for him, but you enjoy him. You know that his puppy love will not end happily, but you know that Rocky will weather the storm.Moreover, her biker friends serve as an extended family to Rocky, who is played by Stolz as a kid who is all heart, and who sees himself not as one desperate to fit in, but who waits for the rest of the world to catch up to him.Wonderful performances by the actors who make up the biker gang of which Gar is a part of.  They are men of depth and compassion as they embrace Rocky as one of their own.The climax delivers one of the more emotionally charged scenes you'll ever see--comparable to ""Beaches"" and ""Imitation Of Life."" It is heart-wrenching without being sappy, showing the depth of a mother;'s love for her offspring.This is definitely one of my all-time favorite films and a must-see for those who love films that have the power to pluck an emotional chord. Good date flick because it has what it takes to touch men and women equally deeply without beating you over the head with sentimentalism.
