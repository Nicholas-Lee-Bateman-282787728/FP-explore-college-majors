1289943,A3NVN6RBBBQ0JQ,B002UJIY8O,Kevin Pazyck,"[1, 3]","This production is literally a companion piece to BBC'sJesus - The Complete Story. Featured are a Baptist pastor and and archeology specialist (accompanied by commentaries from other sources) who visit the Holy Land to investigate long standing Traditions of the Church. I do concede this production on the surface approaches the subject matter with a little more sensitivity than the BBC documentary. But a lot of the very questions they purport to solve are still invariably unanswered.For instance, using a random skull from that region and time, they digitally assume the face of Christ Jesus from that alone and conveniently say (non verbatim) ""This is what Jesus *may* have looked like"". Well. That did not help. Both videos attempted the same project and it just did not prove anything.Archeologically speaking, it is still nice to watch just to pick up a few morsels of scientific knowledge here and there. It did help flesh out what the Palestinian home land was like at that time.But it still cannot reveal the real truths we as Christians are to uphold with faith, hope and charity. And no scientism ever truly should, I guess.In my opinion, get this basically as entertainment, not as a resource to help hinge your faith on. And I underscore ""help"", because it can be used to further cement your own perspective on who Christ is, whether you are Catholic, Orthodox, Protestant or whatever you hold to believe.",3,maybe's and possibly's,1356998400,"01 1, 2013",2013,1421,"['production', 'literally', 'companion', 'piece', ""BBC'sJesus"", 'Complete', 'Story', 'Featured', 'are', 'Baptist', 'pastor', 'archeology', 'specialist', 'accompanied', 'commentaries', 'other', 'sources', 'who', 'visit', 'Holy', 'Land', 'investigate', 'long', 'standing', 'Traditions', 'Church', 'do', 'concede', 'production', 'surface', 'subject', 'matter', 'little', 'more', 'sensitivity', 'BBC', 'documentary', 'lot', 'very', 'questions', 'purport', 'solve', 'are', 'still', 'invariably', 'unanswered.For', 'instance', 'using', 'random', 'skull', 'region', 'time', 'digitally', 'assume', 'face', 'Christ', 'Jesus', 'alone', 'conveniently', 'say', 'non', 'verbatim', 'what', 'Jesus', '*may*', 'have', 'looked', 'Well', 'did', 'not', 'help', 'videos', 'attempted', 'same', 'project', 'just', 'did', 'not', 'prove', 'anything.Archeologically', 'speaking', 'still', 'nice', 'watch', 'just', 'pick', 'up', 'few', 'morsels', 'scientific', 'knowledge', 'here', 'there', 'did', 'help', 'flesh', 'out', 'what', 'Palestinian', 'home', 'land', 'was', 'time.But', 'still', 'can', 'not', 'reveal', 'real', 'truths', 'Christians', 'are', 'uphold', 'faith', 'hope', 'charity', 'scientism', 'ever', 'truly', 'should', 'guess.In', 'opinion', 'get', 'basically', 'entertainment', 'not', 'resource', 'help', 'hinge', 'faith', 'underscore', 'help', 'can', 'be', 'used', 'further', 'cement', 'own', 'perspective', 'who', 'Christ', 'are', 'Catholic', 'Orthodox', 'Protestant', 'hold', 'believe']",Who Was Jesus?

There are few such pieces that can tell me more than I know.  The Scholarly commentary was not sarcastic or caustic. It presented the subject matter with clarity, historically and politically.  I grew to understand the family background of Jesus in a light I had never seen before.  This added to my understanding of the time period, the political causation of events that happened in his life and and gave me insights that were lacking in my own beliefs.
