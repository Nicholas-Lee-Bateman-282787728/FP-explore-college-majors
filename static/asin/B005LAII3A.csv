The actors were good and acting was quite good as well. There is plenty of action, good story, it's not predictable but there is just still one problem with it that made me give it 4 out of 5 stars. The movie is not exciting. It is not boring, it's just okay. What I found quite cool, is the first scene where the main hero fights the authority squad. The angles for the camera were just great and it moved uniquely. The movie also has a three breasted woman like from original ''Total Recall'', however I did not find her as interesting as the original character. It just did not fit her. Not breasts, but the role, it wasn't for her. The movie is 2 hours long, has a big world to show us and generally very, very well done. I loved how they made robots and gave them life. The way they moved and acted, was just awesome to see. It's nothing like the original ''Total Recall'' and I can't say it's a remake. It possesses some elements from the original movie but also misses a lot of other elements. Therefore I can't consider it as a remake.

First, it's been a long time since I read the Phillip K. Dick story the movies are based on, so I can't comment on which movie is closer to the source material.This movie has a different feel from the Arnold version.  The backdrop of the resistance and terrorist attacks makes it feel more contemporary and less of ""just"" a chase story.  The effects and city backdrops are excellent.  The acting is great.  I'm a fan of Colin Farrel and Brian Cranston - both do an excellent job, as does the guy who plays Farrel's friend (can't remember his name).  Having Colin's ex-wife (Kate Beckinsdale, also excellent) chasing him throughout the movie works pretty well.Overall, this is a very different movie from the older Total Recall, though they share some basic elements.  Both are enjoyable for different reasons, but this shouldn't be tossed away as ""just a remake"" of the earlier film.

1480124,A1R8LZYZR3377O,B005LAII3A,ajsteele,"[2, 2]","First off. Amazons rating system of two stars, which I gave the film, means, ""I don't like it"", not ""I hated it."" The only reason I didn't hate it was because the set designs were very good and the surroundings in hi def were decent. But, put that aside and the movie is a tiring act of emptiness. I was expecting Colin Farrell to put a hard edge spin on the Douglas Quade character but he looked lost, straining to look fearful, surprised and angry. Very disappointing acting by Farrell and the rest of the cast. I had heard that the story would not take place on Mars as the original did and figured that would detract somewhat. Well, it detracted a ton, and left the filmmakers scrambling to replicate a Bladerunner environment that visual looked good but emptied the core of the story.The whole feel of Rekall (that's how they spelled it)was lost. In the original Quade really seemed innocent, and his secret agent desires fully contradicted his ""normal"" life."" This film loses the dual memory concept and that in turn plays down the ""fish out of water"" excitement that should have driven the film. Both Biel and Beckensale were uninteresting and gave off zero sex appeal. I felt this era of film making would have given us a serious chick fight but the usual chop/cut style crap was thrown at us again.Worst of all was the villian. So bad that I not only don't remember his name but I don't care. And how many grueling scenes did we sit through of Quade almost being killed except that the killer needed to give fill explanations of why before doing so. Films always give some of that but this became annoyingly full throttle. Lots of gun fire but did you really care who got hit? It's bad when you can almost envision the film cameras nearby and the director yelling ""go"" as the action plays out.Although I have seen the somewhat campy original several times, I think I will now seek it out on blu ray and watch a real interesting sci fi film that had a gripping quality to it. Total Recall 2012 as it relates to the acting and script is a boring failure.

Dick's novel &#34;WE CAN REMEMBER FOR YOU WHOLESALE&#34; so it will have some of the scenes in the first movie. But not all of them and Colin Farrell is great as Carl Quaid not Dennis as was AS. And with 2 very strong women co stars this movie kicks! Kate Beckensale is great as Quaid's wife and agent sent to keep an eye on him. And boy does she turn on the preformance taking the place of Michael Ironside's character and Sharon Stone rolling it into one. Jessica Biel is great as Melina and she is just as great as Kate Beckinsale. There is no other world plot, instead it stays on earth and follows the novel a bit more than the original movie. Although I've only recently seen a few of Colin Farrel's movies he is very verstital as an actor whether he is playing a ruthless vampire, helpless sexually harassed assistant or an agent that has no memory of who he. Very few actors have the ability to take such a variety of roles and be believeable. In this case, Farrell is very believable and his training comes back to him subconciously to keep him ahead of his pursuers. The action begins almost immediately and continues at a faster pace than AS's movie.

1480157,A294WLBCDQ90O7,B005LAII3A,Anonymity,"[0, 1]","The good:The special effects are top notch; however, in this era, any high-budget movie has excellent visual effects, and they are no longer a reason to watch in and of themselves.The bad:Colin Ferrel can simply not carry a movie; he has failed to do so before, and he fails to do so again. When Arnold Schwarzenegger's acting in the same role is of better quality, you know something has gone horribly wrong. Ferrel is flat, and simply not believable in the role of Douglas Quaid.The neutral:Movie makers have always recycled material from their predecessors, so the current wave of ""reboots"" is certainly nothing new. However, in the case of Total Recall, none of the logical reasons for a remake exists. The original is still a movie that does not feel completely dated and is fun to watch. The original audience of the Schwarzenegger version is still very much alive and kicking, and not letting enough time pass between the two versions puts a great deal of pressure on the remake to be much better than its earlier counterpart. It was 43 years between the first two versions of King Kong and 29 more years before the third version showed up. While 22 years may seem like a long time between Total Recall incarnations, the rate at which movie technology has moved during those two decades is much, much slower than at any time before, resulting in a complete lack of wow-factor in the new version.Verdict:Colin Ferrel's acting is absolutely horrid, and is a significant factor in the movie's failure. The rest of the film is not so horrible, but it stills ends up falling on the low end of mediocrity. The end result?

1480158,A1AYNQ4Q8AZ0X,B005LAII3A,anonymous,"[0, 0]","I would have given this product 4 stars, but the audio went out of sync with the video after the audio dropped out for a split second more than once.  I've got about 200 BD's, and I've never had that issue before.  I'm not alone with this problem as I just did a quick search on the Web and discovered others are having sync problems too, and it seems to be happening on a variety of players.  (I'm using a PS3 Slim.) I was able to get the audio back in sync with the video by re-starting a chapter.  Others said they did it by switching from Dolby TrueHD to PCM.  Consumers shouldn't have to find a fix to this problem because Sony Pictures shouldn't have released a product with this issue.  Shame on them.  They need to do the right thing and issue a TOTAL RECALL of this disc and send consumers a corrected replacement... like Universal did a few years back with the ""Jurassic Park"" DVD's.As for the film itself, I really like this film for what it is: a fun popcorn movie with outstanding visual effects and great (but somewhat flawed) surround sound.  Aside from the sync issue, the soundtrack is what you'd expect from an action/sci-fi/popcorn film: loud with lots of explosions and gunfire.  Thankfully, the rear surround channels aren't forgotten or under used as there's plenty of sound coming from them throughout the film.  The visual effects are jaw-dropping at times.  You know a lot of it is CG but most of the time it looks pretty darn convincing.  I wouldn't be surprised if it's nominated for an Oscar for its visual effects.  (If only this movie had been filmed in 3D.  It certainly looks like it was meant to be.  I hope we can look forward to a Blu-ray 3D release with an upgraded soundtrack to 7.1 channels down the road some day.)Not being a fan of the original film, I found this ""Total Recall"" to be a big improvement.  I know some feel exactly the opposite, and that's ok.  To each his own.  Personally, I'm not a fan of Arnold Schwarzenegger's acting in general (unless he's playing a cyborg), and I didn't care for the cheesy jokes sprinkled throughout the original film (lines like ""consider dat a divorce"").  And even back in the day, I thought some of the visual effects were really bad (like when Arnold's character, the woman and the bad guy are all exposed to the Martian atmosphere and their eyes bulge out of their heads).  That's not to say the new film is perfect.  It's not a deep movie, but it's highly entertaining eye candy, and it features a few cool ideas for future technology, such as a cell phone in the palm of your hand (literally) and turning any piece of glass into a computer screen with just the touch of your hand.  I don't know how plausible they are, but they're interesting nonetheless.  I think the Extended Version is the better film as it fills in some blanks.  It's a shame the extra footage wasn't seen in theaters, and it's a shame the director over did it with lens flare.  It's out of control in this movie!

Total Recall is a major sci-fi spectacle on a scale that needs a giant screen to be fully appreciated. The highly detailed special effects are phenomenal and seamless, creating a very believable future dystopia. The acting is great - Farrell pulled this off very well, lending an appropriate sense of gravitas to one whose reality was upended. Sexy Beckinsale and Biel are gorgeous and I love their elevator fight scene. The sophisticated plot only enhanced the killer action scenes.  Recall is in effect a chase flick with great twists.

BUT...It did not disappoint. Len Wiseman directed a good popcorn flick here, paying special attention to great chases and amazing effects in a ""Blade Runner"" (based on Dick's ""Do Androids Dream Of Electric Sheep?"") type future. The cast did a nice job, Farrell (Minority Report) played a good Quaid, and Beckinsale (Underworld) plays the crazed wife particularly well as Lori. Wish there was more of Bryan Cranston (who plays Cohagen.)There are a few great things in this movie, especially for those interested in DOP (Director of Photography.) The wide shot from left to right as Lori and Cole race along the rooftops, the mirrored elevator scene was well done. Cool weapons and technology; in fashion is the implanted hand phone, face holograms, and the awesome bullet cameras.I thought the idea of the elevator ""The Fall"" was a pretty cool idea, an immense shaft that travels through the earth and the anti-gravity scenes were nifty and well done.As a fan of sci-fi genre and Philip K.Dick (author) It's nice to see his works on the screen.

1480195,A6WZVL0SRQAPY,B005LAII3A,Brian Driver,"[0, 0]","THERE ARE NO SPOILERS WITHlN!First off, this is a HIGH 3-pointer&#8230;if Amazon had a 9- or 10-point system I&#8217;d have given it a 7.  It&#8217;s a good remake of the original, but doesn&#8217;t score high in any category but one (ish): special effects.  (More about them later.)My philosophy is the same for music covers as movie retreads: if you&#8217;re going to remake a classic, do something new with it.  Re-interpret it...make it distinctly your own.  And when it comes to movies, add an angle no one&#8217;s thought of.  Give the hero or bad guy different motives.  Set it in a different era.  Whatever: make it your own.  Why else remake it?But other than update the effects, &#8220;Total Recall&#8221; really refuses to go its own way.  In fact, I&#8217;d be more prone to knock a film that does so little to win a new audience, but as &#8220;Total Recall&#8221; pretty much lives or dies with its effects, this one thing has to be enough...and that is a possibility, especially if you haven't seen the original.  Let&#8217;s face it: if you&#8217;re reading this review, it&#8217;s probably the biggest reason you&#8217;re thinking of seeing this movie anyway.So let&#8217;s talk about those effects.  If you&#8217;re as old as me then you&#8217;ll remember how the original movie was noteworthy for the technical ground it broke. In fact, the Oscars honored it with a Special Achievement Award for Best Visual Effects in 1990..a recognition that it was THE film of the year in that category&#8212;no other film was even nominated.  Here, though, as accomplished as these effects are, they don&#8217;t deserve THAT kind of recognition.A large part of the original&#8217;s success was due to director Paul Verhoeven, who equally instilled &#8220;Robocop&#8221; and &#8220;Starship Troopers&#8221; with savvy and clever FX.  He had a way of using technology as a plot device, furthering the story rather than merely outfitting it in order to fill space and time.  For instance, the continual use of newscasts and advertisements in those movies imbued them with clever commentaries on the societies in which they were set.Here, the effects are certainly eye-opening, but only occasionally did they come close to the eye-popping &#8220;Gee Whiz!&#8221; of the original.  There is a scene in which their hovercar&#8217;s vertical control is switched off in order to release them from the flow of traffic, and the drop sequence is pretty stunning...especially the moment they regain control.  You can see the scene in the trailer: the cars beneath them are crushed by contact with the car&#8217;s airjets--not by the car itself.  In this scene, the FX create an intelligent surprise.Additionally, elevators fling their characters about, not only vertically, but sideways as well&#8212;all at top speed (I'd hate to be drinking coffee in this future.).  A nice touch was also supplied by the confusion the effects gave the characters themselves, as in a couple of scenes where 3D holography convinced Quaid that this or that was real when indeed it was no more than a projection...for HIM.So, yes, the effects are dazzling at times, but I felt they had the quality that mars a lot of CGI in movies--that is, it OVERDOES the technology.  If you&#8217;ve seen anything in the last decade, from &#8220;Star Wars&#8221; to &#8220;The Mummy&#8221; to &#8220;the Matrix&#8221; to &#8220;John Carter&#8221;&#8212;scenes are composed of MILLIONS of characters or other gewgaws that crowd the frame in order to overwhelm the audience.  Yet what is gained through gimmickry is ultimately lost through the audience&#8217;s overstimulation.For instance, the scenes outside their &#34;neighborhood&#34; are quite obviously meant to depict a society with out of control growth, with living quarter heaped on living quarter in a dismal, wet, overcrowded borough that, despite its technology, was still basically a slum.  But it's SO full of buildings and lights and stores and wires and vehicles and rain and sidewalks and canopies and people that it's impossible to take in.  Similarly, the very interesting scenes in the transport hubs are also beautifully visualized, but there is so much to take in that I couldn't really tell where characters were coming from or where they were heading.  There was just too much to see.In terms of acting, Colin Farrell is okay&#8230;he&#8217;s athletic enough and does a great job acting confused (it IS required of this role, at least).  In this category all he has to do is beat Schwarzenegger thespian skills--but oddly enough, The Arnold was perfect for a role like this.  He was certainly strong enough to fight off enemies, and his goofy comic book face and voice seemed to be the right fit for an over-the-top movie like &#34;Recall.&#34;Farrell is likable and good looking, but I didn't think he was a great asset to the film. Still, he's at least the kind of guy who might be married to or pursued by Kate Beckinsale and/or Jessica Biel, so give his face credit there.  And there are some good supporting cast members&#8212;including Bryan Cranston&#8212;but many are gone before you even notice them.  This was a sore point for me: Bill Nighy, for one, was wasted&#8230;blink, and he&#8217;s gone.And in this regard I return to the point I made about retreads: the plot really didn&#8217;t go anywhere new.  Granted, some of this is expected&#8212;I mean, you&#8217;d have felt cheated if the three-breasted woman didn&#8217;t make an appearance, wouldn&#8217;t you?&#8212;and the airport security scene is kind of repeated, as well as a couple of others that I wasn't disappointed to see made it back, but one thing the original version had going for it was that the labyrinthine plot kept you guessing: just who IS Douglas Quaid?  Who are these &#34;friends&#34; who seem to want to help him and, perhaps even more important, who are his enemies?  I felt the original did this a little better than the remake&#8230;or maybe that&#8217;s simply because I knew the plot already.  But see?  The new one should make a little more effort to CHANGE things and keep us guessing.This didn&#8217;t.But &#34;Recall&#34; is still fun to watch, especially if this is your first time around.  Maybe a little less TOTAL recall would have helped.",3,Maybe this adaptation is &#34;RECALL-ed&#34; too literally...,1356912000,"12 31, 2012",2012,6276,"['ARE', 'NO', 'SPOILERS', 'WITHlN', 'First',

This one didn't need to be made as it didn't improve the idea, which either way isn't true to the PKD short story in any event. The Mars angle of the first was much more compelling than a wasteland Earth that has only two inhabited areas, Britain and Australia aka The Colony.For some reason the chem warfare that devastated the rest of the planet spared those two locations (?), which can now only be reached via a through-the-center-of-the-earth hole (""keep digging Johnny, you'll hit China""). Flight is apparently RIGHT OUT for some unexplained reason. Also mystifying is the fact that a still chem-devastated area is only a short subway ride from unaffected downtown Britain, meaning weather has also been forestalled along with flight. But beyond those problems the worst part of the film is when the seventy-five year old leader of the Britain side kicks the crap out of our hero, twice.

Third - I am tired of British people dominating American cinema - I thought that there was a revolution in 1776?  Fourth - I don't like Collin Farrell as a leading man, I just don't like his look.  Last, if it ain't broke, don't try to remake it!This film tries to improve upon the original with new technology and fancy effects, but that is the only thing that improved with this lousy remake.  They took away the Mars theme and traded it with the UK and it's partner in crime, Australia being the only places left on earth!  I wonder if this is saying something about our future?  They took away Mathias being a little creature with a human host, which left him being no more mysterious or fascinating than one of the buildings in the film.  The robots were more interesting, if not Star Wars-like.The casting was horrible too!  As mentioned, I am sick and tired of the British always starring in American movies!!  They not only play all major super heroes, but now they are in everything in a way that they do not even explain why a British person would be in the US military or be in the US playing a role in which ever film!  Given the polarization in this country, I would not be surprised if they were behind it!  Why do we keep hearing about THEIR royal family as if they are ours?  We'd better wake up!  Anyway, the cast was bad because the two principle females looked too much alike!  In the original, you had the white, blond Sharon Stone contrasting with the cute, black/hispanic Rachel Ticotin.  You had Arnold and others characters who looked distinct!  This was bad.Hauser throughout most of the film did not trust, know or care about any of the other characters except way into the film when Mathias is killed.  Then he reacts as if he cared when he just met the guy like 5 minutes earlier!  Then after that, he all of a sudden cares about people!  This was bad.  Then at the end, he looks dead, but of course with Hollywood clich&eacute;s, you know that people never die and then the ending after that made it even worse because it looked like an added scene with no rhyme or reason.  This film had poor character development, and unlike the original, we at least liked Arnold, felt that the women were cute and sexy and the bad guys were bad.  We even had a feel as to why the people were oppressed and why the whole story existed.  Here, it was just polishing up in the looks department and that was it.  I swear, the people my age (40) who grew up with these films must be the writers and producers these days and the only thing they seem to know is to remake things or make films out of toys they loved back in the 80's.  If you need ideas, hire me!The remake artists in Hollywood need to know this, the original had appeal because of it's star in Arnold.  Even though the technology was limited then, the effects and look of the film had an appeal that made you want to see it.  The story as it was in the original made you care and want to see it through while with this one, I was hoping that everyone died in the end!  It looks like they set it up for a sequel - I hope not!  Since this flopped at the box office (good - the more people who stay away from remakes, the more they will abandon it), they should not do it again. I don't know why they would spend what they spent on this remake.  It was all looks and not story.

I went into it with the most open of minds and with no attachment to the original. If you're the kind've person that likes great special effects and that trumps a good solid story this movie might be for you. Unfortunately I'm not one of those guys. I really enjoy a good story and a well thought out script. With so much ""action"" and s*** blowing up every 5 seconds, I gotta be honest: the movie was kind've boring (at least to me).To keep this short: here are my pros and cons of the film.:Pros:- Interesting concept (a tunnel through the Earth, from England all the way through the Earth's core to Australia)- Special effects are amazing. Really out of this world (which is why I gave the film 2 stars)(I'm not trying to be a cock, there really aren't any other pros)Cons:- Generic acting. I don't think it's Colin Farrell or Jessica Biel's fault. In fact, I each of their performances in the movie were truthful. However the story and the characters they were given to play were GENERIC AT BEST, BORING AT WORST.- Slow story. It just dragged on and on.- S***ty Writing. There was nothing in this movie that stood out. I was completely uninteristed and uninvolved in the characters success or failure.

1480222,A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ,B005LAII3A,Chris Kennison,"[1, 4]","The original 1990 version of ""Total Recall"" was released at the height of Arnold Schwartzenegger's career and popularity. Despite its many flaws, the movie, loosely based on Philip K. Dick's ""We Can Remember it for You Wholesale"", was a smash hit and is still a respected action science fiction movie. For the most part, it was because of its storyline, but I would say that it is also because of the charisma of its star and the loosey-goosey have some fun direction of Paul Verhoeven.Verhoeven brought that same fun to other action science fiction movies like ""Robo Cop"", ""Starship Troopers"" and (not action sci-fi, but) ""Basic Instinct"". Bottom line, Verhoeven was a master at what audiences wanted to see. He wasn't particularly critically heralded, but audiences loved his violence, seediness and the personality he brought to the characters.In a way, ""Total Recall"" maybe deserved a remake. In 1990, the technology available was nowhere near what we have today. Most of the effects were silly and cheap looking. The new version of ""Total Recall"" has effects and action in spades. If there is one thing that director Len Wiseman is really good at, it's putting together amazing action sequences, and ""Recall"" 2012 maybe his best work to date, in that aspect. The synthetic humanoid army that marches through ""Recall"" 2012 put George Lucas' clone army to shame.Another thing to note is the outstanding performance by Wiseman's wife, Kate Beckinsale, who plays Lori Quaid, a part played by Sharon Stone in the original. She sinks her teeth into the sweet loving wife and ruthless assassin character with charisma and athletics. She is one of the most believable parts of the movie.Unfortunately though, that same charisma and fun that Schwartzenegger brought to the original are completely absent in the remake. Schwartzenegger has never been known as a great actor, but he never failed to bring personality to his characters. No matter what silly line he was uttering, you were with him in his ventures. Colin Farrell, who plays the part in the remake is completely void of anything other than, `look how good-looking and cool I look.'It is a hard pill to swallow, getting past the lack of any sort of deepness from Farrell. He basically wears the same reaction and emotion throughout the entire movie, despite changing characters twice and going through numerous life realizations. That aside, ""Total Recall"" 2012 has been giving a technology overhaul and may be one of Wiseman's best action movies yet. Unfortunately for him though, the movie will probably fall into ho-hum land due to lead actor who couldn't bring the audience to think anything about him one way or the other.",3,Farrell more concerned with looking good then being relatable,1344556800,"08 10, 2012",2012,2684,"['original', '1990', 'version', 'Total', 'Recall', 'was', 'released', 'height', 'Arnold', 'Schwartzenegger', 'career', 'popularity', 'many', 'flaws', 'movie', 'loosely', 'based', 'Philip', 'K.', 'Dick', 'Can', 'Remember', 'Wholesale', 'was', 'smash', 'hit', 'still', 'respected', 'action', 'science', 'fiction', 'movie', 'most', 'part', 'was', 'storyline', 'would', 'say', 'also', 'charisma', 'star', 'loosey-goosey', 'have', 'fun', 'direction', 'Paul', 'Verhoeven.Verhoeven', 'brought', 'same', 'fun', 'other', 'action', 'science', 'fiction', 'movies', 'Robo', 'Cop', 'Starship', 'Troopers', 'not', 'action', 'sci-fi', 'Basic', 'Instinct', 'Bottom', 'line', 'Verhoeven', 'was', 'master', 'what', 'audiences', 'wanted', 'see', 'was', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'critically', 'heralded', 'audiences', 'loved', 'violence', 'seediness', 'personality', 'brought', 'characters.In', 'way', 'Total', 'Recall', 'maybe', 'deserved', 'remake', '1990', 'technology', 'available', 'was', 'nowhere', 'what', 'have', 'today', 'Most', 'effects', 'were', 'silly', 'cheap', 'looking', 'new', 'version', 'Total', 'Recall', 'effects', 'action', 'spades', 'one', 'thing', 'director', 'Len', 'Wiseman', 'really', 'good', 'putting', 'together', 'amazing', 'action', 'sequences', 'Recall', '2012', 'maybe', 'best', 'work', 'date', 'aspect', 'synthetic', 'humanoid', 'army', 'Recall', '2012', 'put', 'George', 'Lucas', 'clone', 'army', 'shame.Another', 'thing', 'note', 'outstanding', 'performance', 'Wiseman', 'wife', 'Kate', 'Beckinsale', 'who', 'Lori', 'Quaid', 'part', 'played', 'Sharon', 'Stone', 'original', 'sinks', 'teeth', 'sweet', 'loving', 'wife', 'ruthless', 'assassin', 'character', 'charisma', 'athletics', 'one', 'most', 'believable', 'parts', 'movie.Unfortunately', 'same', 'charisma', 'fun', 'Schwartzenegger', 'brought', 'original', 'are', 'completely', 'absent', 'remake', 'Schwartzenegger', 'never', 'been', 'known', 'great', 'actor', 'never', 'failed', 'bring', 'personality', 'characters', 'matter', 'what', 'silly', 'line', 'was', 'uttering', 'were', 'ventures', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'who', 'part', 'remake', 'completely', 'void', 'anything', 'other', 'look', 'how', 'good-looking', 'cool', 'look', 'hard', 'pill', 'swallow', 'getting', 'lack', 'sort', 'deepness', 'Farrell', 'basically', 'same', 'reaction', 'emotion', 'entire', 'movie', 'changing', 'characters', 'twice', 'going', 'numerous', 'life', 'realizations', 'aside', 'Total', 'Recall', '2012', 'been', 'giving', 'technology', 'overhaul', 'may', 'be', 'one', 'Wiseman', 'best', 'action', 'movies', 'yet', 'Unfortunately', 'though', 'movie', 'will', 'probably', 'fall', 'ho-hum', 'land', 'due', 'lead', 'actor', 'who', 'could', ""n't"", 'bring', 'audience', 'think', 'anything', 'one', 'way', 'other']",N/A

1480232,A304GUEPCPYM3Z,B005LAII3A,"citan-uzuki ""citan-uzuki""","[0, 0]","Totally better than the original!  This is a very, very good movie.  This is a case of the remake being pretty much better than the original in just about every way.  I was surprised.  That was unexpected.  There have been remakes that are no better than the original, or not even as good.  Case in point is ""Clash of the Titans"".  The remake of that film is very good, but could not quite match Ray Harryhausen's original.  Sure, the special effects were better, but it's hard to match the original casts of Laurence Olivier, Maggie Smith, Harry Hamlin, and Burgess Meredith.  To me, the writing and the acting are mostly what makes a good movie.  The other stuff, the special effects, are just icing on the cake.  So, what makes this remake of ""Total Recall"" better than the original?  As I have stated above, the writing and the acting.Arnold Schwarzenneger has a more imposing physical presence than Colin Farell, but there is no doubt who the better actor is.  Colin's performance is a bit understated compared to Arnold's, but in my mind, that's for the better.  And you do not have to make excuses for Colin's acting abilities.  The standout performance here comes from Kate Beckinsale.  As I have said of her before in my previous movie reviews, she has established herself as one of the top female action stars in the business.  Not only that, she actually has the acting chops to pull off just about any role she's been in.  I actually cannot recall a movie in which she performed badly.  The Lori character has been expanded from the original role played by Sharon Stone.  And maybe that has to do with director Len Wiseman being Kate's real-life spouse, but it was a very good call on his part.  Or rather the writer's part.  I admit to being a fan of Beckinsale's, but she honestly is very good at her craft.  At this point in her career, she is one of the best all-around actresses in Hollywood.  Ofcourse, Jessica Biel is also one very good performer.  Jessica gets better and better every year.  And as she gets older, her sensuality and her sexiness also mature.  This Jessica Biel has a different screen presence than the one that played Abigail in ""Blade"".  Her acting has been solid ever since ""Easy Virtue"".  There is very good chemistry between the three leads in this film.  And credit goes to the leads' having lots of acting experience under each of their belts.  This movie has an all-star cast.Doug Quaid is an underpaid assembly line worker in a robot factory.  He lives in a dumpy apartment, and yet, has a very beautiful and quite obviously sophisticated wife.  He has been having strange dreams lately.  Bothered by those dreams, he decides to visit Rekall.  Rekall is a provider of recreational fantasy, delivered in the form of memory injections.  Basically, you can experience your chosen fantasy using memory implants to trick your brain.  Basically, Rekall takes you on a brain trip, and your brain cannot differentiate between those memories and reality while it's ""tripping"".  While at the Rekall recreation clinic, Doug experiences a complication.  The proprietor then tells us this is due to a conflict between the memory that Doug already has in his head and those they are trying to put in.  So, yeah, obviously Doug is more than just a production technician who assembles robots in a factory line.  The police SWAT team barges in and storms the clinic.It is hard to write a review without spoiling the plot.  In this case, I believe most of you will already have a good idea of the central plot.  Doug manages to elude the SWAT team and makes it back to his house.  As he tells Lori what happened at the clinic, he is further surprised when she tries to kill him.  A very entertaining fight breaks out.  Great choreography and stunt work, by the way.  Doug manages to escape and meets up with Melina.  She knows who he is, but it takes him quite some time to accept that his real name is Carl.  The story then diverges from that of the original, but I do not believe that is necessarily a bad thing.In any case, this is a very good movie.  Len Wiseman shows once again just how capable of a director he is.  I think this is his genre.  He is good with these action films.  Bokeem Woodbine, Bill Nighy, Bryan Cranston, and John Cho play very capable supporting roles.  All in all, a solid action movie.",4,Totally better than the original!,1355788800,"12 18, 2012",2012,4344,"['Totally', 'better', 'original', 'very', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'case', 'remake', 'being', 'pretty', 'much', 'better', 'original', 'just', 'way', 'was', 'surprised', 'was', 'unexpected', 'have', 'been', 'remakes', 'are', 'better', 'original', 'not', 'even', 'good', 'Case', 'point', 'Clash', 'Titans', 'remake', 'film', 'very', 'good', 'could', 'not', 'quite', 'match', 'Ray', 'Harryhausen', 'original', 'Sure', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'better', 'hard', 'match', 'original', 'casts', 'Laurence', 'Olivier', 'Maggie', 'Smith', 'Harry', 'Hamlin', 'Burgess', 'Meredith', 'writing', 'acting', 'are', 'mostly', 'what', 'good', 'movie', 'other', 'stuff', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'just', 'icing', 'cake', 'So', 'what', 'remake', 'Total', 'Recall', 'better', 'original', 'have', 'stated', 'writing', 'acting.Arnold', 'Schwarzenneger', 'more', 'imposing', 'physical', 'presence', 'Colin', 'Farell', 'doubt', 'who', 'better', 'actor', 'Colin', 'performance', 'bit', 'understated', 'compared', 'Arnold', 'mind', 'better', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'make', 'excuses', 'Colin', 'acting', 'abilities', 'standout', 'performance', 'here', 'Kate', 'Beckinsale', 'have', 'said', 'before', 'previous', 'movie', 'reviews', 'established', 'one', 'top', 'female', 'action', 'stars', 'business', 'Not', 'only', 'actually', 'acting', 'chops', 'pull', 'off', 'just', 'role', 'been', 'actually', 'can', 'not', 'recall', 'movie', 'performed', 'badly', 'Lori', 'character', 'been', 'expanded', 'original', 'role', 'played', 'Sharon', 'Stone', 'maybe', 'do', 'director', 'Len', 'Wiseman', 'being', 'Kate', 'real-life', 'spouse', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'call', 'part', 'rather', 'writer', 'part', 'admit', 'being', 'fan', 'Beckinsale', 'honestly', 'very', 'good', 'craft', 'point', 'career', 'one', 'best', 'all-around', 'actresses', 'Hollywood', 'Ofcourse', 'Jessica', 'Biel', 'also', 'one', 'very', 'good', 'performer', 'Jessica', 'better', 'better', 'year', 'older', 'sensuality', 'sexiness', 'also', 'mature', 'Jessica', 'Biel', 'different', 'screen', 'presence', 'one', 'played', 'Abigail', 'Blade', 'acting', 'been', 'solid', 'ever', 'Easy', 'Virtue', 'very', 'good', 'chemistry', 'three', 'leads', 'film', 'credit', 'leads', 'having', 'lots', 'acting', 'experience', 'belts', 'movie', 'all-star', 'cast.Doug', 'Quaid', 'underpaid', 'assembly', 'line', 'worker', 'robot', 'factory', 'dumpy', 'apartment', 'yet', 'very', 'beautiful', 'quite', 'obviously', 'sophisticated', 'wife', 'been', 'having', 'strange', 'dreams', 'lately', 'Bothered', 'dreams', 'visit', 'Rekall', 'Rekall', 'provider', 'recreational', 'fantasy', 'delivered', 'form', 'memory', 'injections', 'Basically', 'can', 'experience', 'chosen', 'fantasy', 'using', 'memory', 'implants', 'trick', 'brain', 'Basically', 'Rekall', 'brain', 'trip', 'brain', 'can', 'not', 'differentiate', 'memories', 'reality', 'tripping', 'Rekall', 'recreation', 'clinic', 'Doug', 'complication', 'proprietor', 'then', 'due', 'conflict', 'memory', 'Doug', 'already', 'head', 'are', 'trying', 'put', 'So', 'yeah', 'obviously', 'Doug', 'more', 'just', 'production', 'technician', 'who', 'robots', 'factory', 'line', 'police', 'SWAT', 'team', 'barges', 'storms', 'clinic.It', 'hard', 'write', 'review', 'spoiling', 'plot', 'case', 'believe', 'most', 'will', 'already', 'have', 'good', 'idea', 'central', 'plot', 'Doug', 'elude', 'SWAT', 'team', 'back', 'house', 'Lori', 'what', 'happened', 'clinic', 'further', 'surprised', 'when', 'kill', 'very', 'entertaining', 'fight', 'breaks', 'out', 'Great', 'choreography', 'stunt', 'work', 'way', 'Doug', 'escape', 'up', 'Melina', 'who', 'quite', 'time', 'accept', 'real', 'name', 'Carl', 'story', 'then', 'original', 'do', 'not', 'believe', 'necessarily', 'bad', 'thing.In', 'case', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'Len', 'Wiseman', 'once', 'again', 'just', 'how', 'capable', 'director', 'think', 'genre', 'good', 'action', 'films', 'Bokeem', 'Woodbine', 'Bill', 'Nighy', 'Bryan', 'Cranston', 'John', 'Cho', 'play', 'very', 'capable', 'supporting', 'roles', 'solid', 'action', 'movie']",N/A

What did the villain want? just to install an army of robots? Why erase Quaid's memory? They should have guessed where the resistance leader would be hiding, I did.

1480246,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B005LAII3A,C. Sawin,"[59, 84]","The original ""Total Recall"" still holds up despite being made back in 1990. The special effects are a little awkward at times, but overall it fits the overall tone of the film. It doesn't take itself too seriously, but isn't completely over the top which is perhaps why it still stands up today. Getting your ass to Mars, pulling tracking beacons out of your head through your nose, being hit in the crotch over and over again, and talking to a puppet attached to a guy's stomach only added to its early 90s goodness. So the people behind the remake decided to strip all of that away and throw in a bunch of ridiculous eye candy. It just doesn't feel the same.""Total Recall"" is now based entirely on Earth and we never even go to Mars. The movie makes it a point to bring up visiting Mars as a Rekall option and it only seems to rub salt in the wound. Colin Farrell is now Douglas Quaid/Hauser, Kate Beckinsale is Lori, Jessica Biel is Melina, and Bryan Cranston is Cohaagen. The action movie is so redundant though. Every fight scene seems to feature Kate Beckinsale sliding on her knees and/or running on the wall/ceiling and Colin Farrell taking cover behind something before jumping (usually in slow motion) to another platform.There was some hope that Bryan Cranston would at least make some part of this worthwhile since he's so extraordinary on ""Breaking Bad,"" but he's only around during the final act and his performance is mostly forgotten thanks to you being mesmerized by his Donald Trump hairstyle. Usually you can appreciate homage in film and be absorbed in the adventure currently being presented to you. With ""Total Recall,"" it's like it's trying so hard to be ""Star Trek,"" then switches gears and jumps to ""I, Robot,"" then ""Minority Report,"" then ""Blade Runner,"" then ""The Fifth Element,"" and the list just keeps piling up. Wearing your influences on your sleeve is one thing, but ""Total Recall"" seems to have too many ingredients in its watered down recipe.While the three breasted prostitute does appear with unclothed breasts (yes, all three of them), it isn't enough to save what is otherwise just a mess of a movie. There is so much unnecessary content thrown in just because it looks cool like the glowing neon tattoos or the gravity switching transportation that has a really lame payoff. When Hauser first meets Matthias (Bill Nighy), Nighy is talking like Hugo Weaving did as Agent Smith in ""The Matrix"" films. It probably doesn't help that he greeted Hauser by saying, ""Mister Hauser,"" and their conversation that followed felt awfully similar to Neo's conversation with The Architect in ""The Matrix Reloaded.""There was that ""South Park"" episode where they say the word ""s**t"" 162 times in the span of a half hour (episode title ""It Hits the Fan""). ""Total Recall"" rivals that as that word is said so much that it begins to lose its meaning. The original had a countless number of crotch shots and the remake is full of s**t.The final product is this really big, juicy piece of flashy, streamlined, anticlimactic, tiresome, candy coated garbage that is just boring. It's as if the movie borrows from not only the original ""Total Recall,"" but several beloved sci-fi films and it never really is able to establish its own entity. Every action sequence is nearly identical to the last while the excessive blockbuster is overflowing with unnecessary content. Kate Beckinsale and her donkey faced acting are around for entirely too long and Jessica Biel is utterly useless. ""Total Recall"" is like shoving streamers and sparklers in a huge pile of crap and trying to pass it off as a party; no matter what you do to it it's still crap.The Blu-ray for the Mind-Bending Edition of the original ""Total Recall"" is around $10-$12. Buy that, stay home, and be happy or go to the theater, see this, and shove your parking valet's face through the windshield of someone's brand new car because you're so enraged that nobody even had the desire to ""start the reactor.""",1,Violates your no-no zone without consent,1343952000,"08 3, 2012",2012,3980,"['original', 'Total', 'Recall', 'still', 'up', 'being', 'made', 'back', '1990', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'little', 'awkward', 'times', 'overall', 'overall', 'tone', 'film', ""n't"", 'take', 'too', 'seriously', ""n't"", 'completely', 'top', 'perhaps', 'why', 'still', 'up', 'today', 'Getting', 'ass', 'Mars', 'pulling', 'tracking', 'beacons', 'head', 'nose', 'being', 'hit', 'crotch', 'over', 'again', 'talking', 'puppet', 'attached', 'guy', 'stomach', 'only', 'added', 'early', '90s', 'goodness', 'people', 'remake', 'decided', 'strip', 'away', 'throw', 'bunch', 'ridiculous', 'eye', 'candy', 'just', ""n't"", 'feel', 'same', 'Total', 'Recall', 'now', 'based', 'entirely', 'Earth', 'never', 'even', 'go', 'Mars', 'movie', 'point', 'bring', 'up', 'visiting', 'Mars', 'Rekall', 'option', 'only', 'rub', 'salt', 'wound', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'now', 'Douglas', 'Quaid/Hauser', 'Kate', 'Beckinsale', 'Lori', 'Jessica', 'Biel', 'Melina', 'Bryan', 'Cranston', 'Cohaagen', 'action', 'movie', 'so', 'redundant', 'fight', 'scene', 'feature', 'Kate', 'Beckinsale', 'sliding', 'knees', 'and/or', 'running', 'wall/ceiling', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'taking', 'cover', 'something', 'jumping', 'usually', 'slow', 'motion', 'platform.There', 'was', 'hope', 'Bryan', 'Cranston', 'would', 'least', 'make', 'part', 'worthwhile', 'so', 'extraordinary', 'Breaking', 'Bad', 'only', 'around', 'final', 'act', 'performance', 'mostly', 'forgotten', 'thanks', 'being', 'mesmerized', 'Donald', 'Trump', 'hairstyle', 'Usually', 'can', 'appreciate', 'homage', 'film', 'be', 'absorbed', 'adventure', 'currently', 'being', 'presented', 'Total', 'Recall', 'trying', 'so', 'hard', 'be', 'Star', 'Trek', 'then', 'gears', 'jumps', 'Robot', 'then', 'Minority', 'Report', 'then', 'Blade', 'Runner', 'then', 'Fifth', 'Element', 'list', 'just', 'piling', 'up', 'Wearing', 'influences', 'sleeve', 'one', 'thing', 'Total', 'Recall', 'have', 'too', 'many', 'ingredients', 'watered', 'down', 'recipe.While', 'three', 'breasted', 'prostitute', 'appear', 'unclothed', 'breasts', 'yes', 'three', ""n't"", 'enough', 'save', 'what', 'otherwise', 'just', 'mess', 'movie', 'so', 'much', 'unnecessary', 'content', 'thrown', 'just', 'cool', 'glowing', 'neon', 'tattoos', 'gravity', 'switching', 'transportation', 'really', 'lame', 'payoff', 'When', 'Hauser', 'first', 'Matthias', 'Bill', 'Nighy', 'Nighy', 'talking', 'Hugo', 'Weaving', 'did', 'Agent', 'Smith', 'Matrix', 'films', 'probably', ""n't"", 'help', 'greeted', 'Hauser', 'saying', 'Mister', 'Hauser', 'conversation', 'followed', 'felt', 'awfully', 'similar', 'Neo', 'conversation', 'Architect', 'Matrix', 'Reloaded', 'was', 'South', 'Park', 'episode', 'where', 'say', 'word', 's**t', '162', 'times', 'span', 'half', 'hour', 'episode', 'title', 'Fan', 'Total', 'Recall', 'word', 'said', 'so', 'much', 'lose', 'meaning', 'original', 'had', 'countless', 'number', 'crotch', 'shots', 'remake', 'full', 's**t.The', 'final', 'product', 'really', 'big', 'juicy', 'piece', 'flashy', 'streamlined', 'anticlimactic', 'tiresome', 'candy', 'coated', 'garbage', 'just', 'boring', 'movie', 'not', 'only', 'original', 'Total', 'Recall', 'several', 'beloved', 'sci-fi', 'films', 'never', 'really', 'able', 'establish', 'own', 'entity', 'action', 'sequence', 'nearly', 'identical', 'last', 'excessive', 'blockbuster', 'overflowing', 'unnecessary', 'content', 'Kate', 'Beckinsale', 'donkey', 'faced', 'acting', 'are', 'entirely', 'too', 'long', 'Jessica', 'Biel', 'utterly', 'useless', 'Total', 'Recall', 'shoving', 'streamers', 'sparklers', 'huge', 'pile', 'crap', 'trying', 'pass', 'off', 'party', 'matter', 'what', 'do', 'still', 'crap.The', 'Blu-ray', 'Mind-Bending', 'Edition', 'original', 'Total', 'Recall', 'around', '10-', '12', 'Buy', 'stay', 'home', 'be', 'happy', 'go', 'theater', 'see', 'shove', 'parking', 'valet', 'face', 'windshield', 'someone', 'brand', 'new', 'car', ""'re"", 'so', 'enraged', 'nobody', 'even', 'had', 'desire', 'start', 'reactor']",N/A

Dick's classic ""We Can Remember It For You Wholesale.""  (Most Dick-to-film adaptations are incredibly loose...but I digress.)  The story is fairly simple, except that it isn't: Douglas Quaid is an everyman in the future, who has dreams of being a hero, fighting alongside a beautiful woman.  These dreams lead him to Rekall, where he's promised the adventure of a lifetime--totally simulated, of course.  Except things go wrong, and Quaid finds himself in a real-life espionage case...except, of course, it may all be the fictional programming.Okay.  Snicker all you want, those of you who've watched the film.  Paul Verhoeven's original actually left viewers a sense of doubt; while not the greatest sci-fi movie of all time, it was a great action vehicle that presented some surprisingly deep characterization, and prompted quite a bit of thought on the part of the viewer (it was and remains a very political film).  Len Wiseman's remake never leaves much to the imagination.  We know who to root for because he's good looking and charismatic and, well, his wife's just not a nice lady.  Wiseman gave us UNDERWORLD and LIVE FREE OR DIE HARD, so we shouldn't bee expecting much depth in the first place.  (And the script is by-the-numbers; great actors like Bryan Cranston and Colin Farrell chew their way through dialogue that is far beneath them; Cranston's entire purpose is to reiterate the plot, for those in the audience who weren't following along.)  Wiseman is keen on visuals, not characterization; and yes, this is a very visual movie, though not as awe-inspiring as the original still remains.  It's got a grittiness that one can't help but like, however, and the action sequences are well-choreographed (perhaps too well).The acting isn't that great; don't be surprised.  Farrell has proven he's got the charisma to be a lead actor in more independent films (IN BRUGES is a modern classic), and on TV's BREAKING BAD, Cranston has become the epitome of the villain everyone loves to hate.  But here, they've got two-dimensional parts.  It's nice to see Farrell getting a paycheck, but that's basically all this is.  As our femme fatales, Kate Beckinsale and Jessica Biel have big shoes to fill; Beckinsale proves she's up to the challenge (she's done this before), Biel not so much.  Billy Nighy drops by for a bit and does his brooding thing, and Bokeem Woodbine just oozes charm as Quaid's friend.  There's a nice (yet confusing) cameo in the unrated version; I won't spoil it.  And that's about all we get on the acting front.  It's all we can expect.

What's even more annoying is that the main ""bad guy"" is a depraved, Teflon-coated, wonder woman who can easily beat the stuffing out of our hero, despite the fact he also happens to be a professionally trained killer with muscles the size of bowling balls. Throughout the entire movie, this wonder woman just keeps coming back like a pesty stalker. Hardly getting a scratch until the very end. I was even waiting for her to start talking like Clint Eastwood! She also enjoyed explaining herself too much and I was really hoping she would get dispatched ASAP because her presence was undermining the entire story!I have to admit I cared about the good guys! I wanted them to win, but unlike the first Total Recall, I didn't care nearly as much. In the original film I desperately wanted the good guys to win! In the remake my feelings were muted. After all the remake has been dumbed-down, which makes it dull. Sure there's plenty of CGI eye candy and plenty of Clone Trooper-type guys in body armor getting miraculously mowed down at every corner. But the story is not edgy in the least! Unlike the original Total Recall, where you really didn't know if the good guys were going to win.And the remake has no message, unlike the original. The original was about mind-bogglingly oppressive corporate greed and as a result you felt a wide range of strong emotions! So much was a stake!I don't like it when a great story is reduced to so many campy cliches! There was great tension building in the first half of the film only to fall apart later! It's so obvious Hollywood focus-grouped the screenplay to death in order to pander to the teen and pre-teen boy segment of the movie going public! Too bad Philip K. Dick will be spinning in his grave tonight. Whoever owns the film rights to his stories should be ashamed of themselves and PLEASE make no more movies if this is the best you can do!

That version (of course) is still fun to watch, and has a lot of sci-fi, comedy, and action.  This one is more sci-fi, with some political drama (nothing aimed at real-life politics, thank God...) and a good amount of action, too.  There is not a lot of comedy, though there are some nods at the previous movie which made me smile (no need for me to list them here; you'll recognize them easily enough).The acting was good, the special effects excellent, and the plot is okay.  I say okay because one of the main characters has clear motivations, but we are not privy to them.  For the whole movie, I could not tell why they were doing those things.  C'est la vie.  Also, after the movie is resolved, if you have half a brain, you will sit there, thinking, &#34;Wait...  They still have the problem of...&#34; and it is not even hinted that there is so much as a plan to fix anything.  Then again, this is not that story.  It's the story of Colin Farrell's character, and it's a pretty good story, too!Last point, and I'm trying to keep this spoiler-free.  Some people are questioning whether the events in the movie actually happen, or if they are all just an implanted memory.  Here is the (spoiler=free) answer: they happened.  If the movie were only implanted memories, we would not get to see conversations that happen far away from him, and yet, we see plenty of those.  Many scenes do not have Farrell anywhere near them, nor watching them, nor listening in.  Thus, they cannot be said to be just memories implanted in him.

1480278,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B005LAII3A,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[2, 2]","From Len Wiseman (director of the ""Underworld"" films, ""Live Free or Die Hard"") comes a remake of the the 1990 film of the same name and based on the 1966 short story ""We Can Remember It For You Wholesale"" by Philip K.Dick.With the original 1990 film directed by Paul Verhoeven and starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, Sharon Stone and Rachel Ticotin becoming a box office success and receiving praise from film critics for its complexity as a sci-fi film, for its remake, the film was to be more of an adaptation of the original short story but instead became more of action film with beautiful, modern visual effects.The film made over $198 million in the box office during the summer of 2012 and now, will be released on Blu-ray which will include both the theatrical version and the extended director's cut.VIDEO:""Total Recall"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:40:1 aspect ratio) and while the film is primarily all visual effects and great use of green screen, on Blu-ray this film looks magnificent.  If anything, I guess the best word to describe the picture quality is ""perfect"".  Detail is amazing, the film looks natural, close-up shots are impressive and I'm just impressed of how awesome the environments look.  Black levels are nice and deep, no sign of banding, artifacts, aliasing or anything negative.  ""Total Recall"" looks magnificent in HD!AUDIO & SUBTITLES:And as one expects from a big budget film when it comes to picture quality, lossless audio doesn't disappoint at all.  Presented in English Dolby TrueHD 5.1, Spanish and French 5.1 Dolby Digital and an English Audio Description Track, the lossless soundtrack to ""Total Recall"" is immersive and an audiophile's dream.  With so much action featured in the film, directional audio of shootouts come from all over the soundscape and is truly immersive.  Ambiance of the city and crowds are also clear and the booms, crashes and bullets striking objects and the overall chaos that happens within the city, great LFE and great use of the surround channels!  Dialogue and music is crystal clear from the front and center channels and the film sounds absolutely dynamic.  ""Total Recall"" features a fantastic lossless soundtrack!  There is nothing negative about it!  Like the picture quality, the lossless soundtrack is perfect!Subtitles are in English SDH, French and Spanish.SPECIAL FEATURES:""Total Recall: Extended Director's Cut"" comes with the following special features on two Blu-ray discs:Total Recall with Insight - While watching the film you will get a split screen that shows how the film was made, behind-the-scenes featurettes, art concept sketches, trivia and more!  Only featured when watching the theatrical cut.Director's Commentary - Featuring  a very informative audio commentary by director Len Wiseman.  For those who want to learn more about Wiseman's mindset and challenges on making this film, will want to listen to this audio commentary.Gag Reel- (8:00) Outtakes from ""Total Recall"".Science Fiction vs. Science Fact - (9:28) Michio Kaku, a professor of Theoretical Physics and Author of ""Physics of the future"" talk about the future of robots, holograms, flying vehicles and the science of ""The Fall"".Designing the Fall - (2:55) A featurette on the film's set and visual scenes for ""The Fall"".Colin Farrell- (3:33) A featurette on the film's lead actor.The Tripping Den- (3:18) A short featurette on the making of one of the main action sequences in the film.Destroying Rekall - (2:24) The making of the scene of the destruction of the Rekall Lab.Kate Beckinsale - (9:42) A featurette about Kate Beckinsale and her character Lori.Lobby Escape - (1:22) A very short featurette on the making of the key action sequence.Jessica Biel - (3:38) A short featurette on actress Jessica Biel and her character Melina.Quaid vs. Cohaagen - (3:05) A featurette about the final fighting sequence featuring Colin Farrell and Bryan Cranston's characters.Stepping Into Recall: Pre-Visualization Sequences - Featuring five motion storyboards: Apartment Waterfront Chase (157), The Fall Fight (11:13), Flight and Tripping Den (4:46), Elevator chase (4:34) and Car Chase (3:27)EXTRAS:""Total Recall: Extended Director's Cut"" comes with an UltraViolet code which allows you to download the movie to your computer and select Apple and Android devices and stream to computers, tables or smartphones.  Also, included is a slipcover case and both extended and director's cut versions of the film with an extra Blu-ray disc containing the special features.  Also, a video game demo for ""God of War: Ascension"" for the Sony PS3 is included.I'm quite aware of the criticism ""Total Recall"" had received, especially when compared to the 1990 film version.  But in someway, I give credit to Len Wiseman for taking on a sci-fi film which the original has its own cult following.  The question was how was he going to make things different.Giving credit to the 1990 Paul Verhoeven film, it was during a time when people were craving something new and unique.  Top films of the year were ""Ghost"", ""Home Alone"", ""Pretty Woman"", ""Dances with Wolves"" and for sci-fi films, it was pretty much ""Total Recall"" and ""Back to the Future III"".  With ""Total Recall"", the film relied on plot, creativity and for its time, it was unique, humorous and imaginative.  People loved the originality with the film and for the 2012 film, aside from using modern visual effects, it's not going to be easy to create a better film, when the original film was so well-liked!My approach to this 2012 version was a film created for today's generation, using the latest in CG visual effects and creating a sci-fi world that would look even more fantastic and amazing than the original film.  And for the most part, I feel that Len Wiseman and crew did accomplish that.But one of the strong points of the original film was its plot and humor, this time around, ""Total Recall"" is more of a popcorn action film and it seems that for today's cinema, it's something that audiences continue to come out for and enjoy and move-on.  When I think about this film, the original 1990 film made you want to watch it again and over 20-years-later, I have watched the 1990 version of ""Total Recall"" on VHS, DVD and Blu-ray a good number of times.And with the original 1990 film, it maintained some semblance to the original short story that it takes place on Mars.  This new film, there is nothing about Mars at all, nor are their aliens.  The original was darker, bloodier but that's what makes the 1990 version a sci-fi classic.  The 2012 version doesn't try to be anything like the original, it doesn't want to be an exact remake and I like that.  I tend to dislike remakes of older films but if they can maintain some semblance to the original but yet be something different, I'm all for it.We have seen remakes or reboots with films such as ""Hulk"", ""Spider-Man"",  ""Superman"", ""Karate Kid"" and the list goes on and on.But with ""Total Recall"", the original was a sci-fi film was dark comedy elements, this 2012 version is a visual effects-driven, popcorn action sci-fi film.  In my opinion, two different types of films.And for those who feel that the 2012 version was dumbed down to be too action-driven, well, if you followed Len Wiseman's films, as a director or producer, the ""Underworld"" films have been like that and even his earlier film ""Live Free or Die Hard"" has been like that.  The fact is that Wiseman is a director who was hired to take on this film because of his experience in action-films.  And for today's audiences who are exposed to video games that tend to be more eye candy and short on plot, a lot of action films seem to be that way and today's audiences are digging it.Personally, with director Len Wiseman and the casting of Colin Farrell, Jessica Biel and Kate Beckinsale, I pretty much expected an action film and nothing to deep or thought-provoking.  So, I came out watching this film with no negative feelings, whatsoever.  I got what I expected and maybe even more with the stunning beautiful visual effects and the outstanding picture quality and lossless audio on Blu-ray.What I enjoyed about this 2012 Blu-ray release is that you get both the theatrical and extended director's cut edition.  And for those who really want to get into the mindset of the challenges that Len Wiseman faced as a director, the audio commentary included with this Blu-ray release is worth listening to!  In fact, there are a good number of special features included on this Blu-ray release, although a good number of them are quite short.Regardless, there's nothing to be angry or spiteful to this film because the original 1990 version is out on Blu-ray.  I look at this as a film tailored to today's audiences who want more action, more visual effects. And that's what the audience is getting.  So, if you enjoyed the original, there is a Blu-ray release for the Paul Verhoeven film available.Overall, ""Total Recall: Extended Director's Cut"" is one of the most beautiful looking sci-fi films on Blu-ray in 2012, looks great, sounds magnificent and a good number of special features are included.  But for anyone looking for something deep or thought-provoking, this is not that type of film.  This is a film for those who love popcorn action films and beautiful sci-fi visual effects.  And if you are that type of viewer, then ""Total Recall: Extended Director's Cut"" is a Blu-ray release that I can easily recommend to you!",4,"Blu-ray: While the 2012 film was average, the Blu-ray

He is a passable actor, looks ok.....just something about the guy guarantees that whatever he is in loses more money than anyone could ever imagine!Incredible....I can't really figure it out. Yes, the movie was a very poor remake but still, it should have at LEAST broken even at the box office just from viewer curiosity over a remake of Arnolds GREAT original version....but true to form....Colin does it again. Colin Farrell truly is a ""one of a kind"" actor the likes of which I have never seen before!The guy must have sex tapes hidden away featuring every movie companies CEO and their mistress.....how he keeps working in the film industry is a mystery beyond comprehension. When on earth are the financers of films going to realize that Farrell ALWAYS guarantees a vast loss of money?? The guy should be driving a taxi, not acting...anything but acting!!The movie itself is poorly done, listlessly acted, poorly shot....just an incredibly lame remake of a truly great movie.

Sadly, the remake version of ""Total Recall"" isn't nearly as good as the original -- a giant chunk of the plot has been jettisoned (goodbye, Mars! Farewell, mutants!) and so has most of the humor and character development. Taken on its own merits, it's a decent enough sci-fi thriller, with some outstanding special effects and a solid (if underdeveloped) performance by Colin Farrell.On impulse, Douglas Quaid (Colin Farrell) decides to go to Rekall, a company that implants false memories for entertainment. But things instantly go very wrong -- a SWAT team bursts in and kills the Rekall employees, and on instinct Quaid kills all of them. When he runs home in a blind panic, his wife Lori (Kate Beckinsale) also tries to kill him, and reveals that she isn't even really his wife.Quaid goes on the run, with only a few cryptic messages and a mysterious safe-deposit box to guide him. But as Lori and the police chase him through the Colony (Australia) and the the United Federation of Britain, he meets a woman (Jessica Biel) who knows him from the past he can't remember -- and might help him bring about a new future.Anyone expecting a straight remake of ""Total Recall"" will be disappointed -- no Mars, no Bennie, no Kuato, no mysterious terraforming engines, and a good chunk of the plot twists have been removed. Oh, and no mutants... well, except for the famous three-breasted woman, whose third breast is never explained because we never see another mutant of any kind.No, this movie is grimly determined to be dark, gritty and ""realistic,"" depicting a  future where the world has been devastated into near-unlivability, and only Australia and a portion of Europe are still semi-normal. It's an intriguing idea, and it is handled in a fairly plausible way... well, except for the giant gravity elevator zipping through the Earth's mantle. That seems far-fetched.Len Wiseman is at his best with the action scenes -- big explosive battles involving magnetic cars, killer robots and bombs, as well as a lot of people shooting at each other. And the future societies are intriguingly-depicted -- either they're grimy, murky cyberpunk mazes (think ""Blade Runner, but less pretty) or cold sterile technohaunts. In fact, the movie could really use some moments of humor or warmth, but neither ever appears.Also... what is with the lens flare? Barely a scene goes by without a lens flare trying to blind me! Was Wiseman possessed by the spirit of JJ Abrams?Colin Farrell gives a typically excellent performance as Doug Quaid/Carl Hauser -- he starts off as a nice ordinary guy, becomes a terrified, confused fugitive, and becomes stronger and more intense as he finds out about his past.

Dick, this 2012 version and the 1990 version starring Arnold Schwarzenegger are rather incomparable, even though every one does. The films have different cinematic qualities in every sense.The earlier Schwarzenegger Total Recall was an entertaining hokey joke. Watching it again reminds that Paul Verhoeven tried too hard to cover too many bases in constructing a sci-fi action flick that can hardly take itself seriously. This jumble looks and feels dated, even as it retains its charms.The Collin Ferrell version is a tightly-spun action thriller: Jason Bourne in the land of Blade Runner post-apocalypse. The cameo nods to the earlier version are a quaint touch, but this movie stands on its own as outstanding. The acting, cinematography and directing are all expertly done.In time, the 2012 Total Recall is likely to be more highly considered than it is now.

Dick's little short story ""We Can Remember It for You Wholesale"". As entertainment this film works well for those who like clever constructs of apocalyptic destruction and robotic culture and the idea behind Dicks story is fascinating to a point. But to make this noisy jumble of fighting and falling and tension last over two hours is begging indulgence.The summary with the product tells it well enough: `Welcome to Rekall, the company that can turn your dreams into real memories. For a factory worker named Douglas Quaid (Colin Farrell), even though he's got a beautiful wife (Kate Beckinsale) who he loves, the mind-trip sounds like the perfect vacation from his frustrating life - real memories of life as a super-spy might be just what he needs. But when the procedure goes horribly wrong, Quaid becomes a hunted man. Finding himself on the run from the police - controlled by Chancellor Cohaagen (Bryan Cranston), the leader of the free world - Quaid teams up with a rebel fighter (Jessica Biel) to find the head of the underground resistance (Bill Nighy) and stop Cohaagen. The line between fantasy and reality gets blurred and the fate of his world hangs in the balance as Quaid discovers his true identity, his true love, and his true fate.There is some fine dialogue that gives the film an uplift: Matthias (Bill Nighy) `It is each man's quest to find out who he truly is but the answer to that lies in the present, not in the past. As it is for all of us.' Doug Quaid (Colin Farrell) 'But the past tells us who we've become.' Matthias: The past is a construct of the mind. It blinds us. It fools us into believing it. But the heart wants to live in the present, look there. You'll find your answer.' The actors cope with this concept well - Collin Farrell is more buff than ever and handles his impossible role well, and Kate Beckinsale, Jessica Biel, Bryan Cranston, Bokeem Woodbine, and Bill Nighy (in a momentary role) all offer interesting moments.If you love sci-fi and clever visual tricks then this is a film for you.

While watching the new TOTAL RECALL, I couldn't help but compare it to the Schwarzenegger film. And if you put nostalgia aside, this 2012 version doesn't really pale in comparison. Two main shifts particularly strike me. The first, obviously, is that Colin Farrell's ""Douglas Quaid"" isn't as imposing or, frankly, as charismatic a presence as Schwarzenegger's. Actually, with Farrell's Quaid, there's a more palpable sense of personal jeopardy. Second, there is no interstellar flight to Mars. All the action takes place on a post-apocalyptic earth. But there is a fun nod to Schwarzenegger's misadventure thru the space port checkpoint.If only them crusading environmentalists could use these dystopian sci-fi movies to legitimately get their point across, we may all be sustainability conscious by now. TOTAL RECALL presents another cautionary tale, evokes one more dark vision of the future. At the close of the 21st century, global chemical warfare has rendered most of the planet uninhabitable. Living space has become the most valuable resource. Two territories remain: the impoverished Colony and the powerful United Federation of Britain.In a world of soulless synthetic police and corporate corruption, Douglas Quaid is a factory worker on an assembly line who dwells in the hard-up Colony. Quaid must every day commute halfway around the world to the UFB by way of the Fall, the sole means of transportation between the two territories. On the day he gets passed over for a promotion, a distraught Quaid visits Rekall, a revolutionary company that can turn fantasies into ""real"" memories. Perhaps inspired by recurring weird dreams, Quaid selects the secret agent package for his fantasy of choice. He gets strapped in.If you haven't seen the original or read the source material - Phillip K. D!ck's 1966 short story, ""We Can Remember It for You Wholesale"" - then you're in for a sweet puzzle. TOTAL RECALL blurs the line between fantasy and reality, and I remember the surging anxiety I felt back in 1990 when Quaid is confronted with the possibility that he may be trapped in a dream state. So, I was saying, one paragraph back: He gets strapped in. But then the memory implant procedure is interrupted when the police busts into Rekall and begins to shoot the place up. Quaid springs into action and is shocked by how effortlessly he takes out the entire police squad. Douglas Quaid is now a man on the run.How does Quaid fit into the Resistance the UFB chancellor (Bryan Cranston) is so desperate to stamp down? Why can he suddenly play the piano? Is he really suffering from a paranoid disassociative break? There are fun homages to the Schwarzenegger picture (three-breasted prostitutes, anyone?). But there's enough of a divergence from the 1990 plot that you can enjoy it as a separate narrative. Okay, there's the occasional plot point obfuscation, but the screenplay has enough smarts, even if it's not as grand in scale, and I love that the set designs exude a dark and dingy Bladerunner vibe. Kate Beckinsale really sells the badass Sharon Stone part, and Kate may well be today's best action female star, she's so effortless and dynamic in her physicality. The film's best action sequence has to be the frenetic extended chase sequence with Beckinsale and Farrell, early on. Jessica Biel is also very good, although she doesn't get to exert herself as much as Beckinsale in the asskickery department. Colin Farrell presents a more believable character than Schwarzenegger's because he cuts a more average figure, which means that we relate to him better. I do feel, though, that Farrell gets a bit lost in the middle of all the big sci-fi goings-on. I wish his dial went past ""stoic."" Maybe his character should've picked a more extroverted part, like a kindergarten cop or Danny DeVito's twin.Lastly, I'll say that the bead of sweat, and not the drop of tear, was more convincing.The DVD's bonus stuff:- ""Inside Mode"" - an option to watch the movie with the occasional video insets that deliver specific behind-the-scenes insights from the filmmakers- ""Science Fiction vs. Science Fact"" - Professor of Theoretical Physics Michio Kaku examines the real-world application of the film's future tech (00:09:26 minutes)- ""Designing the Fall"" - going into the concept and design work that went into the colossal elevator device that travels to the Earth's core (00:02:55)- Gag Reel (00:08:00)",4,"""Tell us your fantasy.

1480356,A28MM46KI4EQB2,B005LAII3A,HeavyMetalSushi,"[1, 3]","Being a big fan of the original Total Recall, I was skeptical at best when hearing about this remake.  I was worried that they were going to stray too far from the path of the original.  However, I was also really excited about it because it looked like it was going to be good...with some great action & special affects, and the cast overall caught my fancy.  I thought maybe there was someone better they could have maybe cast instead of Colin Farrell for the role, but he was actually pretty good.My dad and I were going to go and see this in the theater together because we both enjoy science fiction movies but in the end we never were successful in making it out to catch it.  I had heard good things from a couple of people I know and read enough good reviews here on Amazon so I wound up just buying it on Blu-Ray after it came out, and I wound up scoring a free demo of the upcoming God of War Ascension with it for my Ps3 as well, so that was pretty cool.I was told by someone when going into the movie not to compare it too closely to the original but instead just enjoy the movie for what it is.  It is very much the same as far as concept and it follows the same kind of idea & storyline, but at the same time it's very much it's own movie, and brilliantly so too.  The acting is well done, the action & special affects were outstanding, and movie is just all around a great sci-fi action film!I do not wish to say too much about the plot, the only thing I will say is that it takes place on a post nuclear Earth as opposed to on Mars and there's no alien type stuff or anything.  If you have seen the original film the plot is very similar though in many ways(there's even homage to the 3 boobed chick in it) but I will say this for all of you...don't compare it too closely to the original though.  While it follows the same plot and concept, it does stray to it's own means with a lot of it.  Try to just have an open mind though and enjoy the movie for what it is...a very stylish, updated, thrilling reimagining.  For all sci-fi lovers that have never actually seen the original, definitely see this movie.  I would recommend checking out the original too...just be forewarned of a few cheesy 80s type bits in it but it's an overall worthwhile experience too.",5,Refreshingly Different From Original,1355961600,"12 20, 2012",2012,2277,"['Being', 'big', 'fan', 'original', 'Total', 'Recall', 'was', 'skeptical', 'best', 'when', 'hearing', 'remake', 'was', 'worried', 'were', 'going', 'stray', 'too', 'far', 'path', 'original', 'However', 'was', 'also', 'really', 'excited', 'looked', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'good', 'great', 'action', 'special', 'affects', 'cast', 'overall', 'caught', 'fancy', 'thought', 'maybe', 'was', 'someone', 'better', 'could', 'have', 'maybe', 'cast', 'instead', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'role', 'was', 'actually', 'pretty', 'good.My', 'dad', 'were', 'going', 'go', 'see', 'theater', 'together', 'enjoy', 'science', 'fiction', 'movies', 'end', 'never', 'were', 'successful', 'making', 'catch', 'had', 'heard', 'good', 'things', 'couple', 'people', 'know', 'read', 'enough', 'good', 'reviews', 'here', 'Amazon', 'wound', 'up', 'just', 'buying', 'Blu-Ray', 'came', 'out', 'wound', 'up', 'scoring', 'free', 'demo', 'upcoming', 'God', 'War', 'Ascension', 'Ps3', 'as', 'well', 'was', 'pretty', 'cool.I', 'was', 'told', 'someone', 'when', 'going', 'movie', 'not', 'compare', 'too', 'closely', 'original', 'instead', 'just', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'what', 'very', 'much', 'same', 'as', 'far', 'concept', 'same', 'kind', 'idea', 'storyline', 'same', 'time', 'very', 'much', 'own', 'movie', 'brilliantly', 'so', 'too', 'acting', 'well', 'done', 'action', 'special', 'affects', 'were', 'outstanding', 'movie', 'just', 'great', 'sci-fi', 'action', 'film', 'do', 'not', 'wish', 'say', 'too', 'much', 'plot', 'only', 'thing', 'will', 'say', 'place', 'post', 'nuclear', 'Earth', 'opposed', 'Mars', 'alien', 'type', 'stuff', 'anything', 'have', 'seen', 'original', 'film', 'plot', 'very', 'similar', 'many', 'ways', 'even', 'homage', '3', 'boobed', 'chick', 'will', 'say', 'do', ""n't"", 'compare', 'too', 'closely', 'original', 'though', 'same', 'plot', 'concept', 'stray', 'own', 'means', 'lot', 'Try', 'just', 'have', 'open', 'mind', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'what', 'very', 'stylish', 'updated', 'thrilling', 'reimagining', 'sci-fi', 'lovers', 'have', 'never', 'actually', 'seen', 'original', 'definitely', 'see', 'movie', 'would', 'recommend', 'checking', 'original', 'too', 'just', 'be', 'forewarned', 'few', 'cheesy', '80s', 'type', 'bits', 'overall', 'worthwhile', 'experience', 'too']",N/A

If you thought the Star Trek reboot was bad, you haven't seen anything yet. Lens flares when there isn't even a light in the scene. Even at night, on a darkened street. Len Wiseman apparently is a huge fan of J.J. Abrams, or they studied under the same lens flare techniques professor at college. I'm a die hard sci-fi fan, and pretty forgiving of a movie's shortcomings, like bad acting, poor script, even lame special effects. Remove the lens flares extravaganza, give it a working TrueHD audio, and I'd rate this movie/blu-ray 5 stars, even with the mediocre acting from Colin Farrell and Jessica Biel, even with the so so script. The really good CGI, Bladerunner type scenery, and the good acting by Kate Beckinsale are the saving graces. Katie acted out her best performance yet, maybe due to not wanting to disapoint her hubby director. The blu-ray is quite good, demo quality video, perfect for showing your friends what exactly a lens flare is. The Dolby TrueHD audio is questionable. Drop out every few minutes, and a period of lip sync problem led me to start flipping through my home theater system menu to seek remedy. I can't tell you what exactly I hit upon (PCM?), but I did manage to retrieve working 5.1 HD audio. Why you should have to downgrade your audio setting just to watch this blu-ray is beyond me. Seeking your input on the audio situation.Update 06/26/13: It's now been 7 months since this blu-ray released. Talked with Sony Home Entertainment again! to see if there has been a replacement disc produced with a working TrueHD audio. The short answer....NO. Sony c.s. now advises consumers to run the hdmi cable from the Blu-ray player direct to the tv, not to a home theater receiver. There is some chat in the forums about 'Cinavia' being the culprit. Cinavia is an anti-piracy audio copyright protection software signal embedded within the TrueHD 5.1/7.1, back in 2012 it was apparently new, being tried out. This Blu-ray may have been an early test trial. Sony had no comment about the use of Cinavia. Sony Home Entertainment 1-800-860-2878 or 1-800-421-1404. Call. Complain.

1480364,A2ICW5OUWX2A2V,B005LAII3A,Ian,"[1, 2]","Remaking a classic film (even if it's only a cult classic) can be a strange business: if it isn't broke, why fix it?  That's the logic that applies to the newest iteration of Arnold Schwarzenegger's sci-fi classic, ""Total Recall.""During the twenty second century in the aftermath of a devastating chemical war, the two remaining nations on earth exist in an uneasy state of underground warfare and terrorism.  Among it all, factory worker Douglas Quaid seeks to find meaning in his boring, tedious life.  Desiring to obtain some artificial memories of a more exciting life, Quaid quickly finds himself thrust into a world of war, intrigue, and where nothing is as it seems.What really sets this modern ""Recall"" apart from the original is that it features a more serious, gritty approach to the nearly-identical storyline (which means no witty one liners, trips to Mars, or mutated belly-aliens).  And yet, that's not a bad thing, as it makes for a unique telling of the story, complete with a few welcome changes (Quaid's wife gets a much bigger role, and I found the idea of two continents connected by a massive elevator very interesting).  The production design is also fantastic, combining the visual look of Minority report, the Fifth Element, and Blade Runner, with lots of futuristic tech filling the screen, and delighting the eyes.Still, for all its visual powers, ""Recall"" doesn't feel like it has much weight to it: it's mainly an action movie, with the fascinating ""Who am I?"" plot playing second fiddle.  Most of the film is devoted to seemingly endless chase scenes among futuristic grey buildings and streets, with almost no humor or moments of levity, which gives the impression that the film takes itself a little too seriously.In the end, ""Total Recall"" is a good example of a middle of the road remake.  It does distinguish itself from what came before with a more serious tone, superb visuals, and a very creative climax.

They've tried to update the story line and in the process lost much of what worked the first time around.There are numerous nods to the Arnie classic which make no sense if you haven't seen the original (the triply-endowed woman is thrown in for no reason whatsoever). They combine the characters of Quaid's wife and Richter, which is a real shame, and lose all references to Mars and mutants so this is a really sanitized rethink that looks more like a sequel to iRobot. Kuato is missing, Johnny Cab is long gone and strangely the glitching mask scene is handled really badly compared with the first time around.The special effects are good and the production design owes a huge debt to Blade Runner's Asian influences. I was impressed with how the fight sequences use the vertical space in the sets which was exciting to see despite some over the top camera moves. Kate Beckinsdale isn't really a good replacement for Michael Ironside and Colin Farrell can't really compare to the uber persona of early 90s Arnie.This remake wasn't the cataclysm I expected but by replacing the campy mutants and inter-planetary intrigue with bland CG and robot soldiers, it feels very neutral and sedated.

1480379,A2BFIYZYNK54QX,B005LAII3A,"James Donnelly ""Ave Atque Vale""","[23, 33]","The stories and novels of sci-fi futurist Philip K. Dick have been grist for the movie mill for quite some time since BLADE RUNNER hit the big screen in 1982, but it took until 1990 to get a new story of his onto the screen, based on the short story ""We Can Remember It For You Wholesale"", and that film then became Paul Verhoeven's over-the-top violent sci-fi extravaganza TOTAL RECALL, starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, Sharon Stone, Ronny Cox and Rachel Ticotin. Aside from it totally ignoring most of Dick's story, it's an incredibly fun, campy and action-packed romp.With remakes usually equaling big money for the studios (especially if they can also squeeze out some 3D post-conversions or IMAX formatting), and the technical advances made over the last 22 years, director Len Wiseman (the first two UNDERWORLD films, LIVE FREE OR DIE HARD) took the reins of a not-totally-a-remake and not-totally-a-reimagining of TOTAL RECALL. As is Wiseman's forte, he makes it slick and gorgeous with some great effects and well-choreographed action sequences. Sadly, he also forgot to add any fun to this tale and he didn't allow any of the actors, such as Colin Farrell, Kate Beckinsale, Bryan Cranston and Jessica Biel, to develop any chemistry with each other.Much of the original story's elements are still gone, but Wiseman and screenwriters Kurt Wimmer (also the writer/director of the great EQUILIBRIUM) and Mark Bomback (who also wrote LIVE FREE OR DIE HARD as well as... RACE TO WITCH MOUNTAIN...) as well as master production designer Patrick Tatopolous (who, along with working with Wiseman on UNDERWORLD: EVOLUTION and LIVE FREE OR DIE HARD, directed the third UNDERWORLD installment, subtitled RISE OF THE LYCANS) have firmly planted this film in a much grittier world of the future than was seen in the original film. It's the late 21st century, and much of the world has been made uninhabitable by chemical warfare, so all of the remaining humanity is now divided into two places in the world to live: the more well-to-do live in The United Federation of Britian and the more disenfranchised live on the other side of the world in the remains of Austrailia, now simply known as The Colony, and the only travel from one side to the other is via a massive gravity elevator called The Fall. We follow the humdrum life of Douglas Quaid (Farrell, playing it totally straight) who is a skilled laborer and his wife Lori (played with relish by Beckinsale). They live together in The Colony, which is a hybrid of the poorest parts of many different countries, with the two main influences being Rio de Janeiro and BLADE RUNNER's Los Angeles (the stacked-level apartments; brightly colored and seedy areas). He dreams of a life he never had and looks for some escapism, and this leads him to Rekall, a memory-implantation parlor where it gives you memories that feel like the real thing, and because his actual dreams are that of a tough-guy black-ops type spy, he selects to get implanted with their ""Secret Agent"" package. Although, this touches off a brutal assault on the parlor itself by a number of Federal Police, who Quaid suddenly finds that he is able to calmly disarm and kill all of them. He heads back home to Lori, who initially plays the loving wife and then turns murderous (and British) as she tries to kill him. After disarming her, she tells him that he is not Douglas Quaid; he's got false memories implanted in his head. This catalyst sets off a chain of events where Quaid becomes involved with the mysterious ""girl of his dreams"" Melina (Biel, again, totally straight), the corrupt Chancellor Cohaagen (Bryan Cranston, in a pretty physical performance) and the resistance fighting against Cohaagen's plans to take over the world, led my Matthias (Bill Nighy, not British for some reason). Also, just in case you didn't know, this could still just be a dream.If you've seen the original, you literally have no reason to see this film, because although the film does change the plot of going to Mars and the mutants and the big ""Blue Sky on Mars"" mission, this film plays out very much in the same way. The only moments of ""humor"" to be found in this film are little nudge-nudge wink-winks to the original (the inexplicable appearence of a three-breasted woman, the fat red-headed woman going through security saying ""Two weeks"", etc.). Aside from that, the only fun to be found in this film are the masterfully-created action sequences that take place somewhat early on in the film, such as the fight between Doug and Lori, the magnetic car chase and the super-duper elevator shaft sequence are all incredibly well done and look about as polished as anything in modern film. Unfortunately, the cast (with the exception of Beckinsale) play these moments with deadly seriousness, and it's a real detriment to the enjoyment of the film. This is a SUMMER ACTION FILM REMAKE OF A SUMMER ACTION FILM. Why everyone decided that this should be played in the most serious tone possible was a major misstep for everyone involved. I'm certainly not in favor of all the summer films being without substance or story and should only be these magical one-liner machines, but not only is this film bereft of any real substance, it also just seems like everyone's going through the motions of making futuristic sci-fi. The only one that seems like they're enjoying themselves is Beckinsale, but of course being the director's wife does have its perks. And to be fair to Beckinsale, she is really good.Also other unfortunate side-effects of this remake/reimagining is the distinct lack of two things that were so essential to the success of the first film: First is the violence. This is an exceedingly sterile film. Most of the enemies that appear are these synthetic drone robots which, while being interesting, are by definition soulless automatons. They decided very early on that this was going to be somewhat family-friendly (MUCH more so than the original at least), and made it as bloodless and antiseptic as possible, and the ultra-futuristic setting of the film (people using canoes to navigate flooded streets, elevators that spring up and down and left and right like a bizarre level of a video game, and the deus ex machina of The Fall) is all slicker and polished than it should be. Second, and much more importantly, is the distinction between fantasy and reality, which is a major theme not only of this film, but of Dick's body of work in general. Oddly enough, this was something that was taken much more seriously and more efficiently dealt with in the original film, and it's something that this version tries to do justice, but aside from a few moments in a overly dramatic scene with Farrell, Biel, and Farrell's work buddy Harry (played by Bokeem Woodbine), it doesn't quite connect.As far as performances other than Beckinsale's, whose virtues are dubious but evident, Cranston decides that rather than play a more deliciously ""evil"" villain as Cox did so brilliantly in the original, he plays it straight which is to his strengths as we are aware of him currenly as the brilliant actor that gives Walter White such vivid life, but also have forgotten about the time he spent as the bizarre father on MALCOLM IN THE MIDDLE. This is an actor who is not only dramatic but incredibly comic and both strengths could have been played to. Farrell, who has shown incredible range in his roles over the years, plays this very sullen. There is none of the glint in his eye that he showed in pretty much all of his other roles and none of the charm that one needs to carry a big action film. Jessica Biel is still as bland as she has ever been. I've really tried to find roles she's had over the years that can convince me that she has something to bring to the table other than just a sexy body, and it still hasn't happened, and that's also a big reason that there is zero chemistry between the two leads. Bill Nighy is just wasted here.I know that this is a film that should exist on its own merits, rather than being compared to the original, but that's part of the territory when it comes to a remake; it's either better, worse or on the same level, and despite the lack of anything close to subtlety in Verhoeven's original, that film is eminently watchable and still very lovable for all of its action cliches. Wiseman's version of TOTAL RECALL is only remarkable for its outstanding visual design (which would have worked much better in any other futuristic action film) and its well-orchestrated set pieces, but sadly lacks the spectacle, heart or fun that a big-budget actioner should have.2/5 Stars",2,"Totally eye-popping, and Totally joyless.",1347235200,"09 10, 2012",2012,8627,"['stories', 'novels',

I want to write this so if someone else who may want to avoid immoral content, can be warned. There are supposedly two versions. The original theatric and the director's cut. I read another review to find out the differences in scenes. The one I just watched did NOT say it was the extended directors cut yet it had some (not all though) of the unedited scenes. The only one (from the list I read of another reviewer)that I saw in there was, unfortunately for me, the most mind tainting. I wish I could get rid of the image. I am someone that was expecting a PG13 movie but I was shocked to see full frontal (disturbing)nudity. The original theatrical, she was supposed to be covered by a brassiere. Nope not here. Yet it didn't have some of the other directors cut scenes (like the F-bomb instead of ""Never!""). So was this a mix of the original theatric and director's cut? I don't know. But I just wanted to warn some of you. There are also a ridiculous amount of S#@% words. Which in my opinion (take it or leave it) is unnecessary and shows a lack of creativity in dialogue. But lots of you won't care about that and that is fine, I just wanted to warn those that DO care.I came in fresh and unbiased because I have not seen the original so that I could not compare the two. I really liked it. But from the other reviews it sounds like if you are attached to the original you will not like this. Would I own it? No. Did it keep me enthralled? Yes! So I would recommend renting this (maybe from redbox instead where it is cheaper and may not have the nudity)for an enjoyable, and different kind of movie. I also love the three main characters and think they are awesome actors which really made it. You can't go wrong with Colin Farrell, Kate Beckinsale and Jessica Biel.

1480408,A16Q7QH2XIU11M,B005LAII3A,Jerrod Balzer,"[1, 2]","I finally got around to watching the latest Total Recall movie, and I loved it! I'd heard the moaning and groaning about the movie prior to watching it, and it's one of the reasons I took my time. I've really got to stop letting that stuff get to me! This film was one wild ride!Now, the original film came out in my teens, so I was at just the right age to be completely hooked on it, along with other Verhoeven films such as RoboCop and Starship Troopers. When I heard they were doing a remake of Total Recall, my first reaction was like when I heard about the upcoming RoboCop remake... why? The first was so awesome and still holds up.Then I heard the hate over the news that in the remake, Quaid doesn't go to Mars. This seemed blasphemous to fans but it doesn't bother me one bit. Consider the source material: in Philip K. Dick's short story, ""We Can Remember It for You Wholesale,"" Quail (his name in the story) does not go to Mars. The character had already been to Mars, hence his longing to go after his memory was wiped, but we never see the character leave Earth.Normally, when remakes are done, I'm fine with them so long as they're well-made and they're not carbon copies of the original. The Psycho remake was pointless, in my opinion, as was The Hitcher clone (though the sequel was a hoot). If you're going to tell the story again, do your own thing while paying tribute.The latest Total Recall pulls this off, and it does so beautifully. On most occasions, I prefer the version that can be closest to the source material, like John Carpenter's The Thing - it was much closer to ""Who Goes There?"" than the old The Thing from Another World. However, the short story for Total Recall was actually more of a comedy. Outside of the initial visit to the clinic, it's good that both films do their own thing, and because of the originality we see in both, we have two great, action-packed sci-fi films that stem from the same idea, and the remake does make some great nods to the original which makes it all the more fun.",5,Stands on its own.

1480411,A2AWDN78GY6WNM,B005LAII3A,Jerry Larson,"[0, 2]","Some review of this film that I read said various good things, various bad things, and ultimately concluded that the remake was ""unnecessary"".Well, that's pretty much true of remakes in general, isn't it?  In Hollywood, you can't come up with anything new very often, or can't sell it anyway, so many of the movies are either standard genre productions, sequels (Rocky XXXX.....), or sometimes a remake.  For instance, ""Cape Fear"" with DeNiro was actually pretty good, perhaps better than the original in some ways, maybe not as good in others, but it wasn't really necessary.  Take those actors and that director, give them a good original script, and they could also have done a pretty good film.Rarely does anyone make a remake of a film that didn't work the first time.  One case was the remake of ""The Shining""; the Jack Nicholas version was brilliant, a classic, or an over-the-top nightmare according to who you ask, and I guess somebody thought they could do better.  They were wrong.  You know what I'd like to see remade?  GWTW!  A modern take on those events would be very interesting.The Scwarzenegger ""Total Recall"" was terrific.  It's pretty far from Philip Dick's story ""We can remember it for you wholesale"", but makes good use of the basic idea, and personally I think it's brilliant.  It's a lot of fun, and very watchable.  It's some kind of minor cult classic in any case.  Did these people think they could do better, or were they just cashing in by rehashing?  Well, the new  film is somewhat watchable, somewhat entertaining, has some good stuff in it, so that's why it's worth two stars.  The acting and direction are acceptable, the effects are pretty good, but it does go on way too long.  On the other hand, it has a lot wrong with it, which is what I want to talk about, and really it doesn't add anything.  I haven't seen the director's cut, but this version is already too long, so I wouldn't be very interested in dragging it out even more.First of all, the ""worldwide use of chemical weapons"" has put ""living space at a premium"" and there are ""only two places left""-- Britain, and ""The Colony"", which is Australia.  Workers commute every day from Britain to Australia by this thing called the ""Fall"", which seems to be a giant skyscraper that travels through the earth, through the core, to get to the other side.  (btw, everyone in Britain and Australia seems to have an American accent for some reason.  All the main characters are white too, even more so than the original.  I remember at least there was that black taxi driver).Where to start on the problems with this idea?  Well, it's cumbersome, far-fetched, unnecessary, ridiculous and stupid, but let's not focus on that.There are a couple of technical points I want to bring up, though.One, Britain and Australia are NOT directly opposite each other on the globe.  The antipodal point for Australia is in the North Atlantic.  The one for Britain is near Antarctica.  So the point is, a tunnel from one to the other would not go through the core.Two, these commuters going to the Colony every day, assuming it is directly antipodal, are commuting 8000 miles one way.  At 1000 mph, the trip would take 8 hours, adding up to a 16 hour round-trip commute.  Might just as well live on the Fall, or live where you work, better yet.  In fact, the trip appears to take only a few minutes.  If you make it a one-hour trip, which gives you a fairly arduous but quite do-able two hours every day commuting, the thing must be going 8000 mph.  If you can go that fast, you can travel to other planets.In fact, three, if you had the technology to build a subway straight through the planet, you could do all sort of things, such as, for example, a regular tunnel in which a high-speed train goes a long way at a high speed WITHOUT going through the molten core of the planet!  Or you could re-terraform the planet, or build  space colonies or huge underground cities, or anything besides this cockamamie idea.Other than that, it's basically the same plot as the original Total Recall, except dragged out to the point of stupor.  And perhaps the biggest flaw is, you know absolutely nothing about the Colony, don't meet any of its inhabitants, so why should you care?  In the original, you met a lot of mutants, and they were interesting and sympathetic.  You don't want to see them die of anoxia.There are a few touches that are maybe nice, such as the ""two weeks"" scene or the ""drop of sweat"" scene (or maybe they're not so great, maybe the original was better; in any case, they depend on you having seen the original.)  The three-breasted woman makes no sense at all without the other mutants.  In fact, if you just leave the plot the way it is, Mars, mutants and all, it makes much more sense and works much better.  There are also a lot of things that happen that, if you had time to notice, don't make sense-- why, when the hero is trying to take the Recall trip, do a dozen armed storm troopers instantly show up?  Why lots of little things like that?Above all, why does this damned thing go on so long?In the original, Sharon Stone was blond, and the other girlfriend was dark-haired, so you could tell them apart in the fight scene.  Here, the two of them are both dark-haired, look quite a bit alike, and they have MULTIPLE fight scenes; I could never tell which was which.  Not that I cared.  In the original, you could care about the mutants.  Free Mars!  But here, you don't know a damned thing about the Colony, or Britain either for that matter, and there's no reason to care.  It might make a good video game.  As a film, I can't see what it adds to the original.  In fact, the original is much, much better, and I'd stick with that.",2,Pretty much pointless,1368662400,"05 16, 2013",2013,5727,"['review', 'film', 'read', 'said', 'various', 'good', 'things',

This actor seems to carry a bad luck curse in whatever movie he is in. He starred in another remake of a favorite, Fright Night. IT's flop was so disastrous it went to DVD in just a month or two after its theatrical debut.In this one, he has one expression: a bug-eyed look that makes him look like he's in constant shock/surprise. Or, he resembles someone with the OMG expression of staring into a pair of headlights.The rest of the movie is just a total hurricane of blasting sound effects, constant battles with the she monster. I'm trying to find out the name of the next movie Colin Ferrel will be in so I can be sure to avoid it.I read that this botched remake cost nearly $100 million.

Let's begin with this movie's biggest flaw; it doesn't know whether it wants to be a remake of Arnold's movie, or if it wants to take the original concept and make it it's own. On both accounts this movie fails as it fatally reworks key plot devices that made the original movie great. Nor does it really give much thought to the book's, &#34;Is this a dream or not?&#34; premise. The driving force behind this movie is action which is standard movie schlock for the most part. Only the car chase scene is remotely clever and that is disappointing; you'd think that given the opportunity to have Beckinsale and Beil fight, something better should have been produced for their scene if nothing else. Speaking of the star power, there is very little chemistry between any of the players. Cranston, for example, as the villainous Cohaagen was reminiscent of what happens to soda when you leave the cap off too long and Nighy's Matthias hardly figures into the plot at all.

Director Len Wiseman crafts some decent action scenes and the CGI is top notch. He also adds references to Philip K. Dick's short story We Can Remember It for You Wholesale and the 1990 version of Total Recall. This is the Total Recall movie that you can watch if you're babysitting.Wiseman toned down the sex and violence, but there are plenty of ""S Bombs"". The Director's Cut adds more swearing and restores deleted footage. The only problem I have with the film is that it takes place in an anglophilic world where people can live only in England or Australia. I guess Africa, France, Norway, Sweden, Germany, the Czech Republic, the USA, Mexico, Brazil, China, Russia, South America, and other countries did not survive after World War III! The screenwriters leave out Mars and the mutants from this version. The fat woman with red hair and the call girl with three breasts do show up. Colin Farrell was quite good as Douglas Quaid/Hauser. Jessica Biel was very sexy as Melina. Lori and Richter have been combined into one character. Bryan Cranston from Malcolm in the Middle plays Cohaagen. John Cho is good as a Rekall guy who sells fake memories.The film shows us some forms of technology that could exist.

1480448,A3Q2TXSKKKN60B,B005LAII3A,joseph sacca,"[1, 1]","Fond memories of Paul Verhoeven's ""Total Recall"" kept coming back while watching this remake. Arnold Schwarzenegger's screen presence was also an added plus in the 1990 film, as well as the one-liners, Mars and of course heaps of bloody violence. If you've seen the original, then you know how it goes.Len Wiseman's remake of the same name replaces Arnold with Colin Farrell, in his first lead action role in years, while eliminating Mars as the backdrop of the action and replacing it with an overpopulated Earth where transportation from one corner to another occurs, literally, straight through the center of the earth. The rugged subterranean mazes of the red planet is replaced with dizzying skyscrapers and lots of sleek, flying cars, not unlike Philip K. Dick's own ""Blade Runner"" and ""Minority Report"".Farrell can act and is definitely a strong action lead and it shows here, as per the beautiful ladies Kate Beckinsale and Jessica Biel who both show off brawn over beauty here. Alas, everything is taken way too seriously in this version. I have fonder memories of the Verhoeven/Arnold version where one-liners come post-Arnie-kill. Gone. Certain characters are trimmed or even cut completely from the original. Bryan Cranston's Cohaagen makes me miss Ronny Cox even more, and Bill Nighy's resistance leader doesn't stand out compared to the 1990 film. The best thing the screenwriters did is to combine Sharon Stone's and Michael Ironside's characters from the 1990 film into one, and as portrayed by Kate Beckinsale, she kicks serious ass here.The script is a near complete rehash of the original, save for the setting and the final act of the film. The scene where Bokeem Woodbine's character tries to convince Quaid (Farrell) where he's still in a dream is certainly a standout scene which was very well done. Alas, the majority of the movie is laced with action sequences and sensational special effects (seriously, this is CGI porn) that may get this film a nomination for Best Visual Effects this year. No kidding. While the editing is fast-paced and the cinematography sleek (with a little too much lens flare ala J. J. Abrams), the music score by Harry Gregson- Williams was kind of bland in my opinion. It was just there, does its job, and I didn't care. Where's Marco Beltrami; or even for that matter his legendary mentor, the late, great Jerry Goldsmith when you need them?Director Wiseman has a knack for action sequences (""Underworld"", ""Die Hard 4"") and it shows aplenty here. Sadly the script could've been a whole lot better, but then again, if they had set it on Mars it would've been a shot-for-shot remake with better characters, but still I would've loved to see action on the Red planet once again. The PG-13 rating is justified, and there are indeed little homages to the original, but overall this remake is nothing more than a fast-paced, popcorn munching good waste of time, with some really nice CGI to chew on.However, I'd rather watch the old one again. Arnie has a much stronger screen presence than Farrell and it is much more ambitious and has more heart than this sleeker, newer one.",3,They need to try Again  Poor remake !,1355961600,"12 20, 2012",2012,3125,"['Fond', 'memories', 'Paul', 'Verhoeven', 'Total', 'Recall', 'kept', 'coming', 'back', 'watching', 'remake', 'Arnold', 'Schwarzenegger', 'screen', 'presence', 'was', 'also', 'added', 'plus', '1990', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'one-liners', 'Mars', 'course', 'heaps', 'bloody', 'violence', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'original', 'then', 'know', 'how', 'Wiseman', 'remake', 'same', 'name', 'replaces', 'Arnold', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'first', 'lead', 'action', 'role', 'years', 'eliminating', 'Mars', 'backdrop', 'action', 'replacing', 'overpopulated', 'Earth', 'where', 'transportation', 'one', 'corner', 'occurs', 'literally', 'straight', 'center', 'earth', 'rugged', 'subterranean', 'mazes', 'red', 'planet', 'replaced', 'dizzying', 'skyscrapers', 'lots', 'sleek', 'flying', 'cars', 'not', 'Philip', 'K.', 'Dick', 'own', 'Blade', 'Runner', 'Minority', 'Report', '.Farrell', 'can', 'act', 'definitely', 'strong', 'action', 'lead', 'here', 'beautiful', 'ladies', 'Kate', 'Beckinsale', 'Jessica', 'Biel', 'who', 'show', 'off', 'brawn', 'beauty', 'here', 'Alas', 'everything', 'taken', 'way', 'too', 'seriously', 'version', 'have', 'fonder', 'memories', 'Verhoeven/Arnold', 'version', 'where', 'one-liners', 'come', 'post-Arnie-kill', 'Gone', 'Certain', 'characters', 'are', 'trimmed', 'even', 'cut', 'completely', 'original', 'Bryan', 'Cranston', 'Cohaagen', 'miss', 'Ronny', 'Cox', 'even', 'more', 'Bill', 'Nighy', 'resistance', 'leader', ""n't"", 'stand', 'out', 'compared', '1990', 'film', 'best', 'thing', 'screenwriters', 'did', 'combine', 'Sharon', 'Stone', 'Michael', 'Ironside', 'characters', '1990', 'film', 'one', 'portrayed', 'Kate', 'Beckinsale', 'serious', 'ass', 'here.The', 'script', 'near', 'complete', 'rehash', 'original', 'save', 'setting', 'final', 'act', 'film', 'scene', 'where', 'Bokeem', 'Woodbine', 'character', 'tries', 'convince', 'Quaid', 'Farrell', 'where', 'still', 'dream', 'certainly', 'standout', 'scene', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'Alas', 'majority', 'movie', 'laced', 'action', 'sequences', 'sensational', 'special', 'effects', 'seriously', 'CGI', 'porn', 'may', 'get', 'film', 'nomination', 'Best', 'Visual', 'year', 'kidding', 'editing', 'fast-paced', 'cinematography', 'sleek', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'lens', 'flare', 'ala', 'J.', 'J.', 'Abrams', 'music', 'score', 'Harry', 'Gregson-', 'Williams', 'was', 'kind', 'bland', 'opinion', 'was', 'just', 'there', 'job', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'Where', 'Marco', 'Beltrami', 'even', 'matter', 'legendary', 'mentor', 'late', 'great', 'Jerry', 'Goldsmith', 'when', 'need', 'Director', 'Wiseman', 'knack', 'action', 'sequences', 'Underworld', 'Die', 'Hard', '4', 'aplenty', 'here', 'Sadly', 'script', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'whole', 'lot', 'better', 'then', 'again', 'had', 'set', 'Mars', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'shot-for-shot', 'remake', 'better', 'characters', 'still', 'would', ""'ve"", 'loved', 'see', 'action', 'Red', 'planet', 'once', 'again', 'PG-13', 'rating', 'justified', 'are', 'indeed', 'little', 'homages', 'original', 'remake', 'nothing', 'more', 'fast-paced', 'popcorn', 'munching', 'good', 'waste', 'time', 'really', 'nice', 'CGI', 'chew', 'on.However', ""'d"", 'rather', 'watch', 'old', 'one', 'again', 'Arnie', 'much', 'stronger', 'screen', 'presence', 'Farrell', 'much', 'more', 'ambitious', 'more', 'heart', 'sleeker', 'newer', 'one']",N/A

Some of the criticism is just, but then again, there are movies that are supposed to have deeper meaning, then there are REMAKES. Let me start my review by saying this: A REMAKE is not at all meant to be the original, though a remake may have direct connection and influence from the original a REMAKE is just what it says; the same thing just done in a different way or form. That said, you can call me crazy, but in my opinion Total Recall is a good movie. Is it perfect or award worthy? Absolutely not, but then again its not meant to be. Total Recall knows exactly what it is: A Fast paced Science fiction action flick. It DOES have the action, the intensity, and style that a movie like this needs. Colin Farrell did a good enough job as Doug Quaid or (Carl Hauser if you prefer). Then we have Jessica Biel as Melina and Kate Beckingsale as Lori( I liked her character). Ethan Hawke  makes a surprise cameo; it is brief, but nice to see him in this movie. The story line is what it is: Fast, Suspensful, and unfortunately at times predictable.

1480453,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B005LAII3A,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[9, 13]","I have not seen the Total Recall from 1990, nor have I read the Philip K. Dick short story We Can Remember It for You Wholesale that inspired that film and this one. I intended to watch the original soon after this one, but now I need a few days to cleanse my palette.  I can say without a doubt that this version has better special effects and more elaborate set design, but Total Recall feels like any generic science-fiction movie, re-worked to share elements with the story and slapped with the title to make more money. It's wonderful to look at and boasts the occasionally impressive sequence, but with Len Wiseman's humorless direction and a formulaic script, its little more than forgettable tripe. If Total Recall went by another name it would share the same fate as any other big-budget, predictable sci-fi movie from any given year; quickly disappearing from the public consciousness and ending up in the bargain bin at Wal-Mart. Despite reservations I had about the director (I've had issues with his films before) I was fond of the trailer and excited for the finished product. The trailer is the best thing about this movie.It's the end of the 21st century and due to the devastation caused by global chemical warfare, Earth has become almost uninhabitable and is now divided into two superpowers; the United Federation of Britain and The Colony. Citizens commute between the two via The Fall, a gravity elevator that travels through the Earth's core. Enter factory worker Douglas Quaid (Colin Farrell), happily married for seven years to Lori (Kate Beckinsale) but growing tired of his recurring nightmares and monotonous lifestyle. One night Quaid decides to visit Rekall, a company that implants allows you to experience an imagined adventure. Things go awry when a SWAT team bursts in and Quaid instinctively takes them out. Arriving home, Lori reveals she's not his wife and is actually a UFB agent. Soon he's on the run from her and the entire police force. As he starts to piece together his real identity, he encounters Melina (Jessica Biel), a fixture of his recurring dreams. Bryan Cranston and Bill Nighy co-star as Cohaagen, the president of the UFB and Matthias Lair, the leader of the Colony's rebellion.Total Recall takes inspiration from an earlier film and a short story, but the plot and visual aesthetic recall the Bourne movies, Blade Runner, Minority Report, and any run-of-the-mill science-fiction movie of the last ten years. There isn't an original idea here, but Wiseman's talent lies in visual exposition and he gives the material a fair presentation. If only he'd apply these talents to a better script. With non-stop action, Total Recall only grows dull in the tired way the story plays out. There are layers of mystery and intrigue in the plot, yet the film never builds suspense and many scenes are prolonged beyond necessary. It's bloated, predictable conclusion doesn't help nor does the silly way it attempts to engage the audience a final time in the last couple minutes.The film is somber and humorless, as are the soulless performances. Farrell, Beckinsale, Biel, and Cranston are all charismatic people, yet they bring no charisma to their roles and share no chemistry with each other. Farrell brings likability, Cranston brings his usual intensity, and Beckinsale and Biel bring beauty; but this comes from their own natural persona. Wiseman knows how to create a dystopian world and stage large action sequences, but his grasp on character interaction leaves something to be desired.The elaborate, murky set design makes the film great to look at and the stylized action sequences keep your attention, although there appears to be CGI in scenes of hand-to-hand combat. The futuristic car chase is one of the film's most thrilling scenes, but it's also derivative. A minor, biased complaint; why is there dubstep in this movie? Dubstep is this decade's disco. Is this really something we're going to hear at the end of this century?Total Recall is not a colossal failure, nor is it frustratingly bad. It's just a mediocre, forgettable movie that goes through the motions of its genre.

1480462,A3BRHTAUBZUGK8,B005LAII3A,"Jym Cherry ""Writing Under The Influence of Ro...","[31, 45]","""Total Recall"" with Colin Farrell is more a remake of the 1990 Arnold Schwarnegger version than the Philip K. Dick short story, ""We Can Remember it for you Wholesale,"" and from there, there are a mixture of influences, the world in this ""Recall"" is clearly the ""Blade Runner"" world of Ridley Scott and weirdly enough there seem to be influences of ""Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith.""This Recall focuses more on action, which has a scene in which Farrell and Beckinsale jump several floors of space, crash through numerous windows and land on what looks like very hard concrete slabs all without breaking any arms, legs or ribs. There are also car chases and elevator chases (the Star Wars influence as well as the very disposable synthetic police force).Both movies share with the story ""We Can Remember it for you Wholesale"" what they share with the story is that disgruntled factory worker drudge Douglas Quade longs for a more meaningful, adventure laden life and he is offered the chance to live out his dreams at Total Rekall, a sort of travel agency that will let you live out those fantasies and you will experience them as real and happening to you. After Quade is hooked up to the dream machine something goes drastically wrong when it's discovered Quade really was a spy, that's about where Philip K. Dick left it, from there on in the Schwarzenegger version takes over and everybody is trying to kill Quade, who as time goes on is remembering more about who he was and who he is. Both movies mess with your head with challenging Quade's sense of reality and what is really real and depending on who you believe in the movie(s) Quade is either a spy that was turned to the rebel's cause, or it was all an elaborate plan to let the resistance think Quade had turned in able to track down the resistance leader Matthias and expose and kill him.It's good to see Colin Farrell seeming to make a full revival of his career after the brief part in ""Crazy Heart"" in 2009 he seems back in full strength in ""Total Recall"" as Quade, he's easily a better actor than Schwarzenegger and in the few scenes where he acts (as opposed to being chased or shot at) they are very satisfying moments and you believe his angst at not knowing who he really is. Kate Beckinsale plays Quade's wife, Lori, and is a lot more predatory and persistent than Sharon Stone was in the same role in the 1990 version. Bryan Cranston as Cohaagen is good at channeling his dark side playing a ruthless politician manipulating everyone, especially the public in order to justify an invasion. And Jessica Biel as Melina, Quade's true love that showed him the truth of the resistance, doesn't seem to generate any real heat or chemistry in her relationship with Quade.The 1990 version of ""Total Recall"" messes with your head more, while this version the special effects far outshine what was possible in 1990. Which did I like better? It's a coin flip but I lean more towards the 1990 version, but still if you want to have a pleasant evening of watching the movie on DVD or Blu-Ray you'll enjoy it and maybe they'll put some cool behind the scenes features on the DVD/Blu-Ray version.

The twisted identity juggling in TOTALLY in now if I RECALL correctly (Sorry)... A guy goes for some SPY memory implants and has them already, but THEY'RE REAL, or so he thinks... Then again maybe not. This is more of a remake of the 90's film than the original PKD story ""We can remember it for you Wholesale."" This time with Collin Farrell in Arnold's role, as Doug Quaid a.k.a Carl Hauser, a factory Joe who's  suffering from action-hero night terrors. Other great gets include: Bryan Cranston as Cohaagen evil Chancellor of the UFB , another Underworld Veteran Bill Nighy is Matthias. Kate Beckinsale is amazing as kick-a$$ 'Lori Quaid UFB agent ( I expect Sharron Stone is writing her hate-mail as I write this), this time the lovely Jessica Biel as Melina, a member of the Resistance. Overall its a good film but I thought Biel and Beckonsale's look and body types were so similar (confusingly so at times in action edits) that i'd hoped some more deliberate twist end would come up to make this decision make sense.

1480475,A2EP52TE6GH8OB,B005LAII3A,Kevin Millward,"[0, 0]","There are a few things I really enjoyed about this film.  I liked how it was fast-paced.  There were some solid action sequences and well choreographed fight scenes.  I think Colin Farrell was an okay cast.  I even enjoyed the set design in this film.  The first half of the film was even very enjoyable, but after that, this turned into a Michael Bay-style film.I could make several comparisons between this film and The Island.  This felt like the same kind of style; the pacing, action, and characters were almost parallel.  Colin Farrell's performance was good, but almost every negative thing about the film made it hard for me to care what happened to his character. Another issue I had was the redundant action scenes.  Chase scene after chase scene...they were all the same, nothing to set one apart from the other.I can get over that stuff.  What I cannot get over is more of a technical issue: the lens flares.  I noticed tons of lens flares in the trailer, which meant I knew I'd see even more in the film.  Not only does this look tacky, it is cliche and unnecessary...not only in this film, but in the majority of other films that utilize this effect.  It became annoying and distracting and I found myself mentally deducting stars from this film just based on that reason.  That's how bad it was.In conclusion, Total Recall is a watchable Sci-Fi film that is unnecessary but mildly enjoyable because of how fast of a watch it is.

This is how the story goes: Welcome to Rekall, the company that can turn your dreams into real memories. For a factory worker named Douglas Quaid, even though he's got a beautiful wife who he loves, the mind-trip sounds like the perfect vacation from his frustrating life - real memories of life as a super-spy might be just what he needs. But when the procedure goes horribly wrong, Quaid becomes a hunted man. Finding himself on the run from the police -controlled by Chancellor Cohaagen, the leader of the free world, Quaid teams up with a rebel fighter to find the head of the underground resistance and stop Cohaagen. The line between fantasy and reality gets blurred and the fate of his world hangs in the balance as Quaid discovers his true identity, his true love, and his true fate.The cast led by Colin Farrell (as Douglas Quaid), Kate Beckinsale (as Lori), Jessica Biel (as Melina) & Bryan Cranston (as Cohaagen) is pretty good. The directing by Len Wiseman is pretty good. The screen story (inspired on or based on the short story ""We Can Remember It for You Wholesale"" by Philip K. Dick) by Ronald Shusett, Dan O'Bannon, Jon Povill & Kurt Wimmer & screenplay (inspired on or based on the short story ""We Can Remember It for You Wholesale"") by Wimmer & Mark Bomback is pretty good.The music by Harry Gregson-Williams is pretty good. The cinematography by Paul Cameron is pretty good. The film editing by Christian Wagner is pretty good. The casting by Debra Zane is pretty good. The production design by Patrick Tatopoulos is pretty good. The art direction by Patrick Banister, Oana Bogdan & Brandt Gordon is pretty good.

1480492,A27IYQIZZPAI1P,B005LAII3A,Leonardo Esmero,"[1, 2]","Total Recall 2012 is a remake of the Total Recall 1990 movie. By establishing the plot on Earth instead of Mars, this remake attempts to make a more realistic world for the story to take place. But it could have been more plausible to establish a colony on Mars as in the original 1990 movie, than it would have to make a tunnel that runs through the very center of the Earth as in this remake. Otherwise it made believable through special effects and conceptualization, the environments and technology. It has that well adapted `Blade Runner' dystopian feel.The plot revolves around the question of what reality is. The original movie relied heavily on surreal interpretations of technology, and absurd fantastic moments, which further muddled the line of reality that messed with the viewer's mind. This to me is what was lost in this remake.In this movie many mourn the replacement of the charismatic but aptly ridiculous Arnold Schwazenegger with Colin Farrell. But as the remake goes for the more `realistic' approach I think Colin Farrell a good replacement. Kate Beckinsale is fantastic as she hams up a nasty villain, she wears something tight and this doesn't hurt the eyes at all. I miss her when she is not on the screen.I have no regrets at this buying remake, it is a fun special effects movie.

I am not usually a big fan of movie remakes or re-boots, but this version of the Arnold classic put a twist of the original script to make it new again.  This is not an Arnold remake, rather a fresh new look at how the original story could have gone.  Colin Farrell is great as Quaid, and the sexy Kate Bekinsale and Jessica Biel fill in the movie with good action and eye candy.  Those who may complain about it not being as good as the original, you need to stop comparing them because they are not the same movie.The only problem I had was with the Dolby TrueHD soundtrack.  It constantly kept dropping out.  I exchanged the movie for a replacement and it did the exact same thing at the exact same points in the film.  Amazon gave me a phone number for Sony to call about the issue (Which proves they know there IS an issue).  Sony said to go into the menu of my BluRay player and change the digital audio output to PCM, and that should fix it.  Well, I did what they said and it did fix the drop-outs.  But it was no longer a Dolby TrueHD soundtrack.  It was a standard PCM 2 channel stereo track which played through my system in the old outdated Dolby Pro Logic from the 1980's surround technology.  For me, this defeated the whole idea of having a nice 7.1 home theater system.  So I returned the second disc for a refund until they can fix the soundtrack.  I may try to buy it locally in a store, but if it does the same thing, Sony should hang their heads in shame for not fixing this.Sony should RECALL (no pun intended)the BluRay discs of this movie, and reissue new discs with a Dolby TreuHD soundtrack that works.",4,"Good film, BAD Dolby TrueHD Soundtrack",1372291200,"06 27, 2013",2013,1721,"['reviewer', 'said', 'perfectly', 'Different', 'enough', 'original', 'be', 'entertaining', 'am', 'not', 'usually', 'big', 'fan', 'movie', 'remakes', 're-boots', 'version', 'Arnold', 'classic', 'put', 'twist', 'original', 'script', 'make', 'new', 'again', 'not', 'Arnold', 'remake', 'rather', 'fresh', 'new', 'look', 'how', 'original', 'story', 'could', 'have', 'gone', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'great', 'Quaid', 'sexy', 'Kate', 'Bekinsale', 'Jessica', 'Biel', 'fill', 'movie', 'good', 'action', 'eye', 'candy', 'who', 'may', 'complain', 'not', 'being', 'as', 'good', 'original', 'need', 'stop', 'comparing', 'are', 'not', 'same', 'movie.The', 'only', 'problem', 'had', 'was', 'Dolby', 'TrueHD', 'soundtrack', 'constantly', 'kept', 'dropping', 'out', 'exchanged', 'movie', 'replacement', 'did', 'exact', 'same', 'thing', 'exact', 'same', 'points', 'film', 'Amazon', 'gave', 'phone', 'number', 'Sony', 'call', 'issue', 'Which', 'know', 'IS', 'issue', 'Sony', 'said', 'go', 'menu', 'BluRay', 'player', 'change', 'digital', 'audio', 'output', 'PCM', 'should', 'fix', 'Well', 'did', 'what', 'said', 'did', 'fix', 'drop-outs', 'was', 'no', 'longer', 'Dolby', 'TrueHD', 'soundtrack', 'was', 'standard', 'PCM', '2', 'channel', 'stereo', 'track', 'played', 'system', 'old', 'outdated', 'Dolby', 'Pro', 'Logic', '1980', 'surround', 'technology', 'defeated', 'whole', 'idea', 'having', 'nice', '7.1', 'home', 'theater', 'system', 'So', 'returned', 'second', 'disc', 'refund', 'can', 'fix', 'soundtrack', 'may', 'try', 'buy', 'locally', 'store', 'same', 'thing', 'Sony', 'should', 'hang', 'heads', 'shame', 'not', 'fixing', 'this.Sony', 'should', 'RECALL', 'pun', 'intended', 'BluRay', 'discs', 'movie', 'reissue', 'new', 'discs', 'Dolby', 'TreuHD', 'soundtrack']",N/A

Taken originally from the Philip K. Dick short story ""We Can Remember It for You Wholesale,"" screenwriters Kurt Wimmer (Salt, Street King) and Mark Bombeck (Race to Witch Mountain, Deception) successfully made a new twist on this remake by making it completely earthbound.The original film directed by Paul Verheovem of the same name (1990) is considered a cult classic and they chose to keep the premise on Mars and have the ulterior motive be a corporation taking control of the Earth through deception.This film takes the current political climate of corporations creating a society of automotons that will rule in a police state manner and only the affluent will benefit entirely and be in charge of society while suppressing the poor and weak. The underlying message to everyone using the fantasy service known as Recall is - they will never know themselves again.What shines in this film is the character of Douglass Quaid/Howser who is played extremely passionately by Colin Farrill (Phone Booth, Alexander). His awareness and unawareness is what drives this film. Identity confused and almost not sure who he should believe - including himself - Colin gives an intense performance.The two ladies in this film are also amazing. His ""wife"" played by Kate Beckinsale (Aviator, Pearl Harbor) does a great job in being a determined baddie with a mission to stop Colin's character. And Jessica Biel (The Illusionist, New Year's Eve) plays a person who literally saves him from jeopardy several times, confuses him on his very own identity, and eventually makes her way into his heart.Bryan Cranston (Breaking Bad, Argo) plays an excellent heavy who leads the plot against the suppression of society that no one wants to deal with. On the other side is the short but stunning performance which came from Bill Nighy (Pirates of the Caribbean, Harry Potter) as the leader of the resistance who I felt came to his demise much too soon.Some other notable but stand-out performances come from Colin's best friend played by Bookeem Woodbine (The Rock, Ray) and a small but humorous genius administrator at the Recall facility played by John Cho (Star Trek 2009, Harold & Kumar).Harry Gregson-Williams (Shrek, Cowboys & Aliens) composed an amazing heart pound score for the extremely entertaining action sequences throughout the film.The action sequences involving a very detail magnetic car chase were engaging to the eye. The most amazing feats of stunts and action driven fighting sequences came from an concept where elevators move in all directions at the same time. Making for an amazing chase sequences with fighting, explosions, robots and tons of near misses and hits!Overall the film is fun and filled with action. The story is fairly simple and yet there is enough there to make you root for the good guys and cheer when the baddies are lost. Great visual effects, visually dark in nature and stunning city views of the future make it all candy-for-the-eye, including a `lift' that travels through the Earth's crust itself!Fun for the whole family with mild language and lots of great action -although not as good as the original film for me - this remake is still really worth seeing.",4,Technology Supreme In Fast Action Total Recall!,1345852800,"08 25, 2012",2012,3346,"['are', 'interesting', 'visually', 'stimulating', 'choices', 'director', 'Lein', 'Wiseman', 'Underworld', 'Live', 'Free', 'Die', 'Hard', 'made', 'action', 'adventure', 'Sci-Fi', 'film', 'Taken', 'originally', 'Philip', 'K.', 'Dick', 'short', 'story', 'Can', 'Remember', 'Wholesale', 'screenwriters', 'Kurt', 'Wimmer', 'Salt', 'Street', 'King', 'Mark', 'Bombeck', 'Race', 'Witch', 'Mountain', 'Deception', 'successfully', 'made', 'new', 'twist', 'remake', 'making', 'completely', 'earthbound.The', 'original', 'film', 'directed', 'Paul', 'Verheovem', 'same', 'name', '1990', 'considered', 'cult', 'classic', 'chose', 'keep', 'premise', 'Mars', 'have', 'ulterior', 'motive', 'be', 'corporation', 'taking', 'control', 'Earth', 'deception.This', 'film', 'current', 'political', 'climate', 'corporations', 'creating', 'society', 'automotons', 'will', 'rule', 'police', 'state', 'manner', 'only', 'affluent', 'will', 'benefit', 'entirely', 'be', 'charge', 'society', 'suppressing', 'poor', 'weak', 'underlying', 'message', 'everyone', 'using', 'fantasy', 'service', 'known', 'Recall', 'will', 'never', 'know', 'shines', 'film', 'character', 'Douglass', 'Quaid/Howser', 'who', 'played', 'extremely', 'passionately', 'Colin', 'Farrill', 'Phone', 'Booth', 'Alexander', 'awareness', 'unawareness', 'what', 'film', 'Identity', 'confused', 'almost', 'not', 'sure', 'who', 'should', 'believe', 'including', 'Colin', 'intense', 'performance.The', 'two', 'ladies', 'film', 'are', 'also', 'amazing', 'wife', 'played', 'Kate', 'Beckinsale', 'Aviator', 'Pearl', 'Harbor', 'great', 'job', 'being', 'determined', 'baddie', 'mission', 'stop', 'Colin', 'character', 'Jessica', 'Biel', 'Illusionist', 'New', 'Year', 'Eve', 'person', 'who', 'literally', 'jeopardy', 'several', 'times', 'very', 'own', 'identity', 'eventually', 'way', 'heart.Bryan', 'Cranston', 'Breaking', 'Bad', 'Argo', 'excellent', 'heavy', 'who', 'plot', 'suppression', 'society', 'one', 'deal', 'other', 'side', 'short', 'stunning', 'performance', 'came', 'Bill', 'Nighy', 'Pirates', 'Caribbean', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'leader', 'resistance', 'who', 'felt', 'came', 'demise', 'much', 'too', 'soon.Some', 'other', 'notable', 'stand-out', 'performances', 'come', 'Colin', 'best', 'friend', 'played', 'Bookeem', 'Woodbine', 'Rock', 'Ray', 'small', 'humorous', 'genius', 'administrator', 'Recall', 'facility', 'played', 'John', 'Cho', 'Star', 'Trek', '2009', 'Harold', 'Kumar', '.Harry', 'Gregson-Williams', 'Shrek', 'Cowboys', 'Aliens', 'composed', 'amazing', 'heart', 'pound', 'score', 'extremely', 'entertaining', 'action', 'sequences', 'film.The', 'action', 'sequences', 'involving', 'very', 'detail', 'magnetic', 'car', 'chase', 'were', 'engaging', 'eye', 'most', 'amazing', 'feats', 'stunts', 'action', 'driven', 'fighting', 'sequences', 'came', 'concept', 'where', 'elevators', 'move', 'directions', 'same', 'time', 'Making', 'amazing', 'chase', 'sequences', 'fighting', 'explosions', 'robots', 'tons', 'near', 'misses', 'hits', 'film', 'fun', 'filled', 'action', 'story', 'fairly', 'simple', 'yet', 'enough', 'there', 'make', 'root', 'good', 'guys', 'cheer', 'when', 'baddies', 'are', 'lost', 'Great', 'visual', 'effects', 'visually', 'dark', 'nature', 'stunning', 'city', 'views', 'future', 'make', 'candy-for-the-eye', 'including', 'lift', 'Earth', 'crust', 'Fun', 'whole', 'family', 'mild', 'language', 'lots', 'great', 'action', '-although', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'original', 'film', 'remake', 'still', 'really', 'worth', 'seeing']",N/A

I'm not sure how he ended up in Total Recall and Fright Night because neither film gave him much to work with in terms of dialogue or story. Total Recall is about a guy who discovers his identity has been tampered with. The original story was very creative but this version is watered down despite the larger budget. It seems they didn't put as much into sets, creativity or plot in favor of action and special-effects. What's the problem? This film has none of the fun or ultra-violence of Arnold Schwarzenegger's 1990 version. This is dark, depressing and redundant at times. It recycles sets from Blade Runner, Judge Dredd and other films which looks cool but ultimately feels paper-thin because the story is eschewed for computer effects. The effects do look good but are not totally convincing because of how overdone they are. It's somewhat of a chore to sit through at times because it seems like Farrell and his lovely co-stars are setting something up but they never get off the ground. They had great source material in ""We Can Remember it for You, Wholesale"" by Philip K. Dick but that doesn't seem to be a source of inspiration here. Total Recall managed to gross only half its budget in the US; it bombed in theaters. The worst part? They don't go to Mars! The story is about ""The Fall"" (which is some kind of underground elevator) and how it will save us all. Don't ask. Amazingly this movie gets a 2-disc release with special features.

Had placed too much hope in the film, the letdown ended up far greater had I just gone in without any expectations.What truly bothered me was this wasn't a reboot or fresh interpretation ofthe source Philip K. Dick short story. Ultimately, it was a straight forward duped copy of the1990 movie. For a solid sixty-to-seventy percent of the flick, it was a virtual scene-by-scene total rip of the original. They didn't even change the script. Oh, they altered the 'Free Mars' aspect and turned it inward, sure. And the dense CGI cityscapes were very impressive. But making a xerox copy isn't creating art or even entertainment. (Before anyone says it, which would you rather have - the copy or the real thing? I know which I'd choose)More so given that I thought Colin Farrell and Jessica Biel skillfully executed their roles, providing excellent performances to the production. And, as it happens, I like both actors. But even their energetic and sincere efforts couldn't, and wouldn't, salvage this inferior imitation. There just wasn't enough meat on the bone; not enough for the audience to feel empathy toward or engage as their characters. And most disappointingly, the one aspect I expected to play a huge aspect in the film - Rekall's false memories - didn't play a significant part in the plot at all. Wow.Sadly, this production is utterly soulless, lacking even the dark comedic touches of the original. I don't think I laughed once during the entire film. Where was the brassy repartee? The twisted joys of Venusville? The snarky one-liners? If they were going to do a rip-off, why neuter the better parts?It seemed everyone took themselves, especially the director, so seriously.Reboots are best when filmmakers are inspired by the original, revitalizing the old school with a new school vibe. Giving a fresh coat and a new addition to a well-loved home. Same thing with cover songs. If you're going to do a version - make it *your* version - not do a singalong with a karaoke machine.Director Len Wiseman didn't create anything - all he did was consume the original and regurgitate. Made more stunning given his incredibly enjoyable work on 'Live Free or Die Hard'.Another Michael Cimino? I really hope not.For comparison's sake, a great example of a proper reboot: The J.J. Abrams version of 'Star Trek'. An incredible, brilliantly creative and completely fresh take of a story that we all know so well. But despite our familiarity, showcasing the characters by placing them in a brand new perspective; like falling in love with your significant other all over again. And as a side benefit, wholly revitalizing a franchise that was, let's be honest, getting kind of stale. The new Trek is the benchmark for filmmakers who are going to mine the past for content.Very disappointed in this cold and derivative paint-by-numbers rehash.",2,Disappointing Paint-By-Numbers Regurgitation,1346544000,"09 2, 2012",2012,2921,"['Was', 'really', 'looking', 'forward', 'flick', 'explaining', 'why', ""'m"", 'so', 'disappointed', 'Had', 'placed', 'too', 'much', 'hope', 'film', 'letdown', 'ended', 'up', 'far', 'greater', 'had', 'just', 'gone', 'truly', 'bothered', 'was', 'was', ""n't"", 'reboot', 'fresh', 'interpretation', 'ofthe', 'source', 'Philip', 'K.', 'Dick', 'short', 'story', 'Ultimately', 'was', 'straight', 'forward', 'duped', 'copy', 'the1990', 'movie', 'solid', 'sixty-to-seventy', 'percent', 'flick', 'was', 'virtual', 'scene-by-scene', 'total', 'rip', 'original', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'change', 'script', 'Oh', 'altered', ""'Free"", 'Mars', 'aspect', 'turned', 'inward', 'sure', 'dense', 'CGI', 'cityscapes', 'were', 'very', 'impressive', 'making', 'xerox', 'copy', ""n't"", 'creating', 'art', 'even', 'entertainment', 'anyone', 'would', 'rather', 'have', 'copy', 'real', 'thing', 'know', ""'d"", 'choose', 'More', 'so', 'given', 'thought', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'Jessica', 'Biel', 'skillfully', 'executed', 'roles', 'providing', 'excellent', 'performances', 'production', 'like', 'actors', 'even', 'energetic', 'sincere', 'efforts', 'could', ""n't"", 'would', ""n't"", 'salvage', 'inferior', 'imitation', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'meat', 'bone', 'not', 'enough', 'audience', 'feel', 'empathy', 'engage', 'characters', 'most', 'disappointingly', 'one', 'aspect', 'expected', 'play', 'huge', 'aspect', 'film', 'Rekall', 'false', 'memories', 'did', ""n't"", 'play', 'significant', 'part', 'plot', 'Wow.Sadly', 'production', 'utterly', 'soulless', 'lacking', 'even', 'dark', 'comedic', 'touches', 'original', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'laughed', 'once', 'entire', 'film', 'Where', 'was', 'brassy', 'repartee', 'twisted', 'joys', 'Venusville', 'snarky', 'one-liners', 'were', 'going', 'do', 'rip-off', 'why', 'neuter', 'better', 'parts', 'seemed', 'everyone', 'took', 'especially', 'director', 'seriously.Reboots', 'are', 'best', 'when', 'filmmakers', 'are', 'inspired', 'original', 'revitalizing', 'old', 'school', 'new', 'school', 'vibe', 'Giving', 'fresh', 'coat', 'new', 'addition', 'well-loved', 'home', 'Same', 'thing', 'cover', 'songs', ""'re"", 'going', 'do', 'version', 'make', '*your*', 'version', 'not', 'do', 'singalong', 'karaoke', 'machine.Director', 'Len', 'Wiseman', 'did', ""n't"", 'create', 'anything', 'did', 'was', 'consume', 'original', 'regurgitate', 'Made', 'more', 'stunning', 'given', 'incredibly', 'enjoyable', 'work', ""'Live"", 'Free', 'Die', ""Hard'.Another"", 'Michael', 'Cimino', 'really', 'hope', 'not.For', 'comparison', 'sake', 'great', 'example', 'proper', 'reboot', 'J.J.', 'Abrams', 'version', ""'Star"", 'Trek', 'incredible', 'brilliantly', 'creative', 'completely', 'fresh', 'take', 'story', 'know', 'so', 'well', 'familiarity', 'showcasing', 'characters', 'placing', 'brand', 'new', 'perspective', 'falling', 'love', 'significant', 'other', 'over', 'again', 'side', 'benefit', 'wholly', 'revitalizing', 'franchise', 'was', 'let', 'be', 'honest', 'getting', 'kind', 'stale', 'new', 'Trek', 'benchmark', 'filmmakers', 'who', 'are', 'going', 'mine', 'past', 'content.Very', 'disappointed', 'cold', 'derivative', 'paint-by-numbers', 'rehash']",N/A

It was a great science fiction film filled with plenty of action, top notch special effects and of course the use of cute quips by Arnold. It's still a good movie to watch and enjoyed. So count me among the surprised to find that I actually enjoyed the remake that comes out this week on DVD as much as if not more than the original.For those who don't know here's the story: The Earth is overrun with people and only two areas that are now able to support life, one in what we know of as England run by Cohaggen and another in what was once Australia. To get from one point to the other you board ""The Fall"", a skyscraper size ship that passes through a tunnel from one area to the other. The folks at the Aussie end are protesting their abuse at the hands of the others and use ""The Fall"" as a symbol of their life of servitude. Matthius (Bill Nighy) is their rebel leader, demanding a release by the people in the English area.Douglas Quaid (Colin Farrell) works in a factory that builds robot security troops for Cohaggen. He continues to have nightmares about a escaping the police with a woman he doesn't recognize (Jessica Biel). He wakes each night beside his wife Lori (Kate Beckinsale) unable to explain his dream other than to say it felt so real. Feeling as if something is missing in his life, he sees an ad for a company called Rekall.Going to Rekall, Doug learns that it's a vacation that takes place in the brain. Rekall injects you with drugs and implants memories into your brain that make you feel as if you've experienced the travel dream of your choice, as long as you've never actually been involved in your choice in real life. Doug chooses the life of a spy but as he begins to go through the process the machines alerts the officials that he actually was a spy. Before he can argue the point the door burst in and a security team sweeps in killing the Rekall members and attempting to capture Doug. Except that his natural instincts kick in and he takes out the entire team and escapes.Unaware of what is going on, Doug continues to try and escape the police and get home. Once there he is comforted by Lori who suddenly turns on him and tries to kill him. While they fight she lets him know this is not the happy home he though, that they were never married and that she was sent to watch him in case he remembered anything other than the implants the government placed in his brain. Doug escapes Lori and the chase is on. With little to go on and secretive clues that he apparently left himself, Doug is trying to find out first what is going on and second where he fits into the whole scheme of things.So what makes this version different from the original? First off the amount of action involved. This film is an adrenaline rush from start to finish. At the same time it offers enough story to carry it along as well rather than opt for non-stop gunplay and running.  Most intriguing is the fact that you wonder till very near the end if this is all really happening or if it's all a part of the Rekall experience that Doug asked for. Is he really Doug or a double agent? And what about the girl in his dreams, where does she fit in to all of what is going on? If you've seen the original you know the answer, if not then you'll keep wondering until all is revealed.Perhaps the biggest change from this movie to the original is the setting and motivation for the action being seen. It no longer takes place on Mars and doesn't revolve around generators that create an atmosphere there. Instead it sticks to this planet and problems between two areas that represent what is left of Earth. For me that didn't ruin the film at all. And perhaps that's why it didn't feel like so much of a complete remake and more like a re-imagining instead.Ferrell does much better in this remake than last years FRIGHT NIGHT which missed completely. He does a great job as the confused Quaid. Beckinsale and Biel do tremendous as well moving from love interests to action stars in the blink of an eye. Having done so before my guess is both will continue to do so in the future and do it well.It's been 20 years since the original film was released so I'm certain that there is a generation out there that's never seen that film who will enjoy this one on its own merits. Fans of the original, if they allow themselves to forget that film, will find this one entertaining as well. For me its one that I know I will have no problem pulling it out and watching again; it's that good.",4,REMAKE OF RECALL,1357776000,"01 10, 2013",2013,4601,"['Let', 'be', 'known', 'was', 'fan', 'movie', 'TOTAL', 'RECALL', 'starred', 'Arnold', 'Schwarzenegger', 'back', '1990', 'was', 'great', 'science', 'fiction', 'film', 'filled', 'plenty', 'action', 'top', 'notch', 'special', 'effects', 'course', 'use', 'cute', 'quips', 'Arnold', 'still', 'good', 'movie', 'watch', 'enjoyed', 'So', 'count', 'surprised', 'find', 'actually', 'enjoyed', 'remake', 'out', 'week', 'DVD', 'as', 'much', 'not', 'more', 'original.For', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'here', 'story', 'Earth', 'overrun', 'people', 'only', 'two', 'areas', 'are', 'now', 'able', 'support', 'life', 'one', 'what', 'know', 'England', 'run', 'Cohaggen', 'what', 'was', 'once', 'Australia', 'get', 'one', 'point', 'other', 'board', 'Fall', 'skyscraper', 'size', 'ship', 'tunnel', 'one', 'area', 'other', 'folks', 'Aussie', 'end', 'are', 'protesting', 'abuse', 'hands', 'others', 'use', 'Fall', 'symbol', 'life', 'servitude', 'Matthius', 'Bill', 'Nighy', 'rebel', 'leader', 'demanding', 'release', 'people', 'English', 'area.Douglas', 'Quaid', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'factory', 'robot', 'security', 'troops', 'Cohaggen', 'have', 'nightmares', 'escaping', 'police', 'woman', ""n't"", 'recognize', 'Jessica', 'Biel', 'night', 'wife', 'Lori', 'Kate', 'Beckinsale', 'unable', 'explain', 'dream', 'other', 'say', 'felt', 'so', 'real', 'Feeling', 'something', 'missing', 'life', 'ad', 'company', 'called', 'Rekall.Going', 'Rekall', 'Doug', 'vacation', 'place', 'brain', 'Rekall', 'injects', 'drugs', 'implants', 'memories', 'brain', 'make', 'feel', ""'ve"", 'experienced', 'travel', 'dream', 'choice', 'as', 'long', ""'ve"", 'never', 'actually', 'been', 'involved', 'choice', 'real', 'life', 'Doug', 'life', 'spy', 'go', 'process', 'machines', 'officials', 'actually', 'was', 'spy', 'can', 'argue', 'point', 'door', 'burst', 'security', 'team', 'sweeps', 'killing', 'Rekall', 'members', 'attempting', 'capture', 'Doug', 'natural', 'instincts', 'kick', 'out', 'entire', 'team', 'escapes.Unaware', 'what', 'going', 'Doug', 'try', 'escape', 'police', 'get', 'home', 'Once', 'comforted', 'Lori', 'who', 'suddenly', 'tries', 'kill', 'fight', 'know', 'not', 'happy', 'home', 'were', 'never', 'married', 'was', 'sent', 'watch', 'case', 'remembered', 'anything', 'other', 'implants', 'government', 'placed', 'brain', 'Doug', 'Lori', 'chase', 'little', 'go', 'secretive', 'clues', 'apparently', 'left', 'Doug', 'trying', 'find', 'out', 'first', 'what', 'going', 'second', 'where', 'whole', 'scheme', 'things.So', 'what', 'version', 'different', 'original', 'First', 'amount', 'action', 'involved', 'film', 'adrenaline', 'rush', 'start', 'finish', 'same', 'time', 'enough', 'story', 'carry', 'along', 'as', 'well', 'rather', 'opt', 'non-stop', 'gunplay', 'running', 'Most', 'intriguing', 'fact', 'wonder', 'till', 'very', 'end', 'really', 'happening', 'part', 'Rekall', 'experience', 'Doug', 'asked', 'really', 'Doug', 'double', 'agent', 'what', 'girl', 'dreams', 'where', 'fit', 'what', 'going', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'original', 'know', 'answer', 'not', 'then', ""'ll"", 'keep', 'wondering', 'revealed.Perhaps', 'biggest', 'change', 'movie', 'original', 'setting', 'motivation', 'action', 'being', 'seen', 'no', 'longer', 'place', 'Mars', ""n't"", 'revolve', 'around', 'generators', 'create', 'atmosphere', 'there', 'Instead', 'planet', 'problems', 'two', 'areas', 'represent', 'what', 'left', 'Earth', 'did', ""n't"", 'ruin', 'film', 'perhaps', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'so', 'much', 'complete', 'remake', 'more', 're-imagining', 'instead.Ferrell', 'much', 'better', 'remake', 'last', 'years', 'FRIGHT', 'NIGHT', 'missed', 'completely', 'great', 'job', 'confused', 'Quaid', 'Beckinsale', 'Biel', 'do', 'tremendous', 'well', 'moving', 'love', 'interests', 'action', 'stars', 'blink', 'eye', 'Having', 'done', 'so', 'guess', 'will', 'continue', 'do', 'so', 'future', 'do', 'well.It', 'been', '20', 'years', 'original', 'film', 'was', 'released', 'so', ""'m"", 'certain', 'generation', 'there', 'never', 'seen', 'film', 'who', 'will', 'enjoy', 'one', 'own', 'merits', 'Fans', 'original', 'allow', 'forget', 'film', 'will', 'find', 'one', 'entertaining', 'as', 'well', 'one', 'know', 'will', 'have', 'problem', 'pulling', 'watching', 'again', 'good']",N/A

Furthermore (being a typical Sony disk) it has about 3x more FBI warnings and the like that you also can't skip, almost all of which in language you don't speak.  If you want to watch this movie, you should use Amazon instant video or a similar service, not the disk.The actual movie is kinda of ""flat"". There is a lot of good action but it lost the connection with the viewer and feels disconnected.There is a very serious problem here with acting. You can think about Kate Bekinsale what you want, her acting ability is very good compared to the standards of this movie.  The male lead has none, and that turns Kate Bekinsale's performance into a problem.  Jessica Biel does what she can, and I think she constantly improves, but she can't undo this mess between the two leads.  Kate Bekinsale's character is also a bit too furious given what the story looks like in the final edit, some of it is really not well explained, so she ends up looking overplayed.They changed details of story development in this version of the story that have to count as dumbing down.*POSSIBLE SPOILER AHEAD*Namely, there is a key scene where the bad guys want to convince the good guy he is in a dream. The way that he figures out the truth in this movie is a typically hollywood move to make it more emotional but makes no sense whatsoever as proof wrt dream or not.  Likewise, the final escape when everything seems lost seems to have lost logic bits in editing and it is unclear what is happening.Don't laugh but I'm bothered by Kate Bekinsale's hair which is a huge mane in perfect shape at all times, no matter whether she's waking up or just had a gunfight. No fighter in the word would wear hair like that. Apart from never being able to see anything it's also way too easy to grab on to.  This is out of character for the furious flavor they gave this character here.All things considered this movie looks like they edited with spoken text off.

Otherwise, you will always be competing with the memory of the original film.""That's a basic canon of Hollywood moviemakers that seems to be increasingly ignored these days.  Remakes of SABRINA, 3:10 TO YUMA and THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL are just three relatively recent examples that prove the viability of that rule.Arnold Schwarzenegger starred in the original 1990 version of TOTAL RECALL, directed by Paul Verhoeven, and which is, in this writer's opinion, one of the best science-fiction movies ever made.  (A small caveat: I am not a big fan of science-fiction movies.  There are a very few that I like.)Now, TOTAL RECALL has been remade, this time starring Colin Farrell with Len Wiseman directing.Though the original is a better film overall, this new action-thriller will certainly entertain viewers, particularly those who have not seen the 1990 film.  It does, however, make some essentially cosmetic changes to the storyline of Verhoeven picture, including combining two key characters into one.Set near the end of this century when most of Earth in uninhabitable, this version of the Philip K. Dick short story (""We Can Remember It For You Wholesale"") has Farrell playing Douglas Quaid, a factory worker who visits Rekall, a company that can turn his superspy fantasies into real memories.  But, when the procedure goes terribly wrong, the line between fantasy and reality blurs.  Quaid discovers that his life is an illusion.  He becomes a man on the run; the only person alive who can save the lives of half the planet.Where this 2012 picture betters the original version of TOTAL RECALL is in its masterful use of CGI special effects, which were not available when the 1990 film was made.  Indeed. Wiseman and his crew have created a marvelous futuristic world that evokes and even betters memories of movies like BLADE RUNNER and MINORITY REPORT.  The action sequences are exciting and the performances from the talented cast (Kate Beckinsale, Jessica Biel,  Bryan Cranston and Bill Nighy) are first rate.Unfortunately, Wiseman has allowed the action sequences and superb visual effects to overshadow story and characterization, which results in his film being less compelling than its predecessor.As previously stated, if you haven't seen the Schwarzenegger version of TOTAL RECALL, you will definitely enjoy this unnecessary remake much more than I did.Sony Pictures Home Entertainment has made TOTAL RECALL available in 3 and 2 Disc Blu-Ray/DVD combo packs, as well as a single disc DVD edition.

1480548,A35VJC424AGADX,B005LAII3A,"MikeB ""Metalhead""","[0, 0]","Being a big fan of the original Total Recall, I wasn't sure how I felt about them making an updated version, especially because the original is now on Blu-ray and looks amazing. I decided to check this out and see how it fared.THE GOODThe visuals in this movie are great. I really like the world they created, and the digital effects are very convincing. The set design, costumes and make-up are all first rate, and I have to give props to the designers for creating an imaginative and convincing future. The director also has an eye for interesting composition, and frames the movie well. This movie was fantastic to look at. Comparing this to other Blu-rays on the market, the clarity and fidelity are superb. The action sequences are pretty intense, so if you like lots of firefights and explosions, this shouldn't disappoint. The music and sound effects are fitting, and the audio quality is what you've come to expect from a Blu-ray disc. I don't have 5.1 surround, just stereo, so I can't comment on surround sound, but in stereo is sounded fine.THE MEHThe acting is not bad. Nothing stood out, but there weren't any particularly bad actors that distracted from the film. I am a big fan of Breaking Bad, so I especially enjoyed seeing Bryan Cranston as the villain, but he wasn't given enough screen time to stretch is acting chops beyond, ""Hi, I'm the bad guy"". I have no opinion of Colin Farrell one way or the other, but in this movie he did a decent job. As the lead, he held his own, but just barely. Everyone else was forgettable.Another area that could have used some work is the pacing. The film seems to be in 5th gear the whole time, and refuses to let up even at the end. The problem this creates is that it becomes a predictable pattern. Characters give a little bit of uninteresting exposition, then a 20 minute chase ensues, replete with gunfire and explosions, then they have a 2 minute breather with more exposition, then another 20 minute chase, then exposition, then chase, and so on. Without proper pacing, the ""big revelation"" of who Douglas Quaid really is, followed by another ""big revelation"", has no impact on the audience because the actors seem too exhausted from the last 20 minute chase to really give a darn.THE BADThis script is seriously lacking. There are no memorable lines, with the exception of lines borrowed from the 1990 film, and there's even a few scenes that makes small nods to the original film, which only serve to remind you of how much this version is lacking. There are three big problems with the script. First, it focuses way to heavily on the action sequences, and barely leaves room for story and character development. Second, the dialogue is really boring. Characters don't have anything particularly interesting to say, and don't have a clever or engaging way of saying it. I felt more like the characters were reading a synopsis off the back of the box rather than having natural conversations. Third, the story is too thin. This is really apparent when you compare it to the original. So much happened in that movie, so many twists and turns, so many interesting locations, so many characters, and they all seemed to have personality and purpose. The new Total Recall strips away the layers of depth from the original and all we're left with is a skeleton of a plot, a 2 hour movie with 6 minutes of story and 114 minutes of gunfire.One final gripe, and this is more personal preference than anything else, but the characters seem invincible. Throughout the movie, dozens of trained police officers with semi-automatic weapons fire at the protagonists, miss every shot, then the protagonists will fire a couple shots and hit their mark flawlessly every time. Some of these police officers are robots, and even they miss. You'd think if they can build robots in the future, they could program some competent auto-aim software as well. It got pretty ridiculous in one scene where Quaid is surrounded by nearly 100 police officers in a building lobby, all of them aiming assault weapons at him and his partner. Logically the two protagonists surrender, since fleeing would be suicide. But then after a brief conversation, the two flee anyway and escape without a scratch. 100 cops, that have them completely surrounded and have been aiming at them for the last five minutes, are unable to hit two people standing in the middle of an open lobby in broad daylight!? WHAT?OVERALLIf you like seeing special effects in High Definition, rent this movie. It looks pretty, but it's not very memorable.

And here's what I think.Pro:1)the graphic and technology taken in this movie is the only thing that you can say it surpass the first, but what do you expect after 25 years? Computer generated objects are pretty much flawless. And some angles at some scene are breath taken. But it really took down by the other facts.2) The actors are more handsome, you can arguably say Colin Farrell, Kate Beckinsale are better at presence than Arnald and Sharon Stone respectively, forgive me but I would say the first one's acting seem more natural to me.Con:1) first off, no Mars?? this really pissed me off when I watched it, the Mars Myth was the key plot to the whole story, instead they have the splited colonies when it play absolutely no part in the story, this is a BIG BIG thumb down, way down way way down to bottom of the sewer.They took it out because Mars colony isn't reality ( that no matter how hard scientist try it won't happen ever). But thats the first mistake they made that they can't distingulish the fake reality and possible future. In science fiction nobody argue what's possible in the future, when it isn't happening yet, just doesn't mean it won't. And that's what we used to like the first movie, introduce what it could be but not it gonna be.2) no humor, this is another one I found hard to take it down, when I saw the first movie I was both impressed by how the plot was breath taken and how some scene was hilarious - like that when you see Arnald shot his ex wife and say ""consider that a divorce"". Instead they have everybody tighten their vein and read something out of the script.. it's uninspiring at the best.3) no mutants, *sigh, they missed out all the goodies4) no world change at the end, the ending of original was one of the most reflesh memory experience I had on movies, the world changed about 180 degrees at the last 5 minutes. And the movie lovely throw you a question to its reality just before blackout end credit roll up. This movie practically got nothing..I used to call the first movie ""total retard"" for humor, but this, I don't bother to have another minute engage to it.-[...]",2,Total Recall should NOT be redo,1372291200,"06 27, 2013",2013,2311,"['Redo', 'movie', 'plain', 'wrong', 'begin', 'change', 'made', 'was', 'lousy', 'one', 'even', 'less', 'entertaining', 'comparing', 'Arnold.I', ""'m"", 'really', 'being', 'fair', 'movie', 'tried', 'like', 'here', 'what', 'think.Pro:1', 'graphic', 'technology', 'taken', 'movie', 'only', 'thing', 'can', 'say', 'surpass', 'first', 'what', 'do', 'expect', '25', 'years', 'Computer', 'generated', 'objects', 'are', 'pretty', 'much', 'flawless', 'angles', 'scene', 'are', 'breath', 'taken', 'really', 'took', 'down', 'other', 'facts.2', 'actors', 'are', 'more', 'handsome', 'can', 'arguably', 'say', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'Kate', 'Beckinsale', 'are', 'better', 'presence', 'Arnald', 'Sharon', 'Stone', 'respectively', 'forgive', 'would', 'say', 'first', 'one', 'acting', 'seem', 'more', 'natural', 'me.Con:1', 'first', 'Mars', 'really', 'pissed', 'when', 'watched', 'Mars', 'Myth', 'was', 'key', 'plot', 'whole', 'story', 'instead', 'have', 'splited', 'colonies', 'when', 'play', 'absolutely', 'part', 'story', 'BIG', 'BIG', 'thumb', 'down', 'way', 'down', 'way', 'way', 'bottom', 'sewer.They', 'took', 'out', 'Mars', 'colony', ""n't"", 'reality', 'matter', 'how', 'hard', 'scientist', 'try', 'wo', ""n't"", 'happen', 'ever', 'first', 'mistake', 'made', 'ca', ""n't"", 'distingulish', 'fake', 'reality', 'possible', 'future', 'science', 'fiction', 'nobody', 'argue', 'what', 'possible', 'future', 'when', ""n't"", 'happening', 'yet', 'just', ""n't"", 'mean', 'wo', ""n't"", 'what', 'used', 'like', 'first', 'movie', 'introduce', 'what', 'could', 'be', 'not', 'be.2', 'humor', 'one', 'found', 'hard', 'take', 'down', 'when', 'saw', 'first', 'movie', 'was', 'impressed', 'how', 'plot', 'was', 'breath', 'taken', 'how', 'scene', 'was', 'hilarious', 'when', 'see', 'Arnald', 'shot', 'ex', 'wife', 'say', 'consider', 'divorce', 'Instead', 'have', 'everybody', 'tighten', 'vein', 'read', 'something', 'script..', 'uninspiring', 'best.3', 'mutants', '*sigh', 'missed', 'out', 'goodies4', 'world', 'change', 'end', 'ending', 'original', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'reflesh', 'memory', 'experience', 'had', 'movies', 'world', 'changed', '180', 'degrees', 'last', '5', 'minutes', 'movie', 'lovely', 'throw', 'question', 'reality', 'just', 'before', 'blackout', 'end', 'credit', 'roll', 'up', 'movie', 'practically', 'got', 'nothing..I', 'used', 'call', 'first', 'movie', 'total', 'retard', 'humor', 'do', ""n't"", 'bother', 'have', 'minute', 'engage', 'it.-', '[', ']']",N/A

1480563,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,B005LAII3A,M. Oleson,"[3, 6]","I almost went back to take another look at the 1990's version, but I'm glad I didn't.  There are a couple things that are big distinctions between the two.  First, this new iteration eschews the going to Mars thing and relies more on the Phillip K. Dick short story, ""We Can Remember It for You Wholesale.""  Second, the main character of Douglas Quaid is played by a real actor (Colin Farrell) vs. the original played by body builder/investor/politician Arnold Schwarzenegger.  Without getting into too many comparisons between the two films, certainly the Arnold version had wit along with the campy feel.  This new version lacks both and to some extent, to its detriment.In this dystopian world of the late 21st century, Earth is left with 2 inhabitable civilizations.  Based on a map briefly displayed in the film the world's one-percenters live in an area known as the United Federation of Britain comprised of the U. K. and parts of northern Europe.  Everyone else lives in the Colony (the former Australia).  One of the nice things about the movie is the visualization of this world, straight out of Ridley Scott's masterpiece ""Blade Runner"" which of course was also written by Dick.  It is here where much of the action takes place.  And action there is.Quaid is a worker on an assembly line making robots at the UFB and commutes daily via The Fall which appears to be a giant subway that gets from the Colony to UFB in a matter of minutes by short cutting through the middle of the planet.  Cool.  Midway on this ride, the transport does some kind of back-flip which causes a zero gravity state.  That comes into play late in the film.  Also cool.  Quaid's wife is played by everyone's favorite-in-black-leather, Kate Beckinsale (also director Len Wiseman's wife).  She stays around much longer than poor Sharon Stone did with Arnie in the original.Out of boredom, Quaid decides to take a shot at a mind altering memory process called Rekall (not a typo).  This interupted experiment brings him to a conscious state where he now has the fighting ability of a trained military agent.  He also now is being hunted by the bad guys headed by Cohaagen (Bryan Cranston), the head of UFB.  Cohaagen is close to unleashing an army of robotic soldiers to cleanse the Colony of the unwashed.  Quaid is assisted by Melina (Jessica Biel), his one time lover.  Unfortunately he doesn't remember her.  Melina and Kate get it on, uh...fighting scenes, a couple times which is... meh.In addition to the lack of humor, ""Total Recall"" (2012) also lacks the chemistry between the characters to give it much depth.  In the aforementioned ""Blade Runner,"" the main characters are given time to connect and build an understanding even between enemies.  Here, there is no attempt.  Instead that time is given to 2 or 3 excellent, if too long, chase sequences.  In short this is a visually excellent sci-fi thriller with plenty of cool toys (love the built-in hand phone) and lots of action.  And if you're wondering about the 3-breasted prostitute in the original, she shows up here too with a fleeting peek-a-boob in keeping with the PG-13 rating.",3,3 1/2 stars for an imperfect action filled sci-fi reboot,1344038400,"08 4, 2012",2012,3132,"['almost', 'went', 'back', 'take', 'look', '1990', 'version', ""'m"", 'glad', 'did', ""n't"", 'are', 'couple', 'things', 'are', 'big', 'distinctions', 'two', 'First', 'new', 'iteration', 'going', 'Mars', 'thing', 'more', 'Phillip', 'K.', 'Dick', 'short', 'story', 'Can', 'Remember', 'Wholesale', 'Second', 'main', 'character', 'Douglas', 'Quaid', 'played', 'real', 'actor', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'original', 'played', 'body', 'builder/investor/politician', 'Arnold', 'Schwarzenegger', 'getting', 'too', 'many', 'comparisons', 'two', 'films', 'certainly', 'Arnold', 'version', 'had', 'wit', 'campy', 'feel', 'new', 'version', 'extent', 'detriment.In', 'dystopian', 'world', 'late', '21st', 'century', 'Earth', 'left', '2', 'inhabitable', 'civilizations', 'Based', 'map', 'briefly', 'displayed', 'film', 'world', 'one-percenters', 'live', 'area', 'known', 'United', 'Federation', 'Britain', 'comprised', 'U.', 'K.', 'parts', 'northern', 'Europe', 'Everyone', 'else', 'Colony', 'former', 'Australia', 'One', 'nice', 'things', 'movie', 'visualization', 'world', 'straight', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'masterpiece', 'Blade', 'Runner', 'course', 'was', 'also', 'written', 'Dick', 'here', 'where', 'much', 'action', 'place', 'action', 'there', 'is.Quaid', 'worker', 'assembly', 'line', 'making', 'robots', 'UFB', 'commutes', 'daily', 'Fall', 'be', 'giant', 'subway', 'Colony', 'UFB', 'matter', 'minutes', 'short', 'cutting', 'middle', 'planet', 'Cool', 'Midway', 'ride', 'transport', 'kind', 'back-flip', 'zero', 'gravity', 'state', 'play', 'late', 'film', 'Also', 'cool', 'Quaid', 'wife', 'played', 'everyone', 'favorite-in-black-leather', 'Kate', 'Beckinsale', 'also', 'director', 'Len', 'Wiseman', 'wife', 'around', 'much', 'longer', 'poor', 'Sharon', 'Stone', 'did', 'Arnie', 'original.Out', 'boredom', 'Quaid', 'take', 'shot', 'mind', 'altering', 'memory', 'process', 'called', 'Rekall', 'not', 'typo', 'interupted', 'experiment', 'conscious', 'state', 'where', 'now', 'fighting', 'ability', 'trained', 'military', 'agent', 'also', 'now', 'being', 'hunted', 'bad', 'guys', 'headed', 'Cohaagen', 'Bryan', 'Cranston', 'head', 'UFB', 'Cohaagen', 'close', 'unleashing', 'army', 'robotic', 'soldiers', 'cleanse', 'Colony', 'unwashed', 'Quaid', 'assisted', 'Melina', 'Jessica', 'Biel', 'one', 'time', 'lover', 'Unfortunately', ""n't"", 'remember', 'Melina', 'Kate', 'get', 'uh', 'fighting', 'scenes', 'couple', 'times', 'meh.In', 'addition', 'lack', 'humor', 'Total', 'Recall', '2012', 'also', 'chemistry', 'characters', 'give', 'much', 'depth', 'aforementioned', 'Blade', 'Runner', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'given', 'time', 'connect', 'build', 'understanding', 'even', 'enemies', 'Here', 'attempt', 'Instead', 'time', 'given', '2', '3', 'excellent', 'too', 'long', 'chase', 'sequences', 'short', 'visually', 'excellent', 'sci-fi', 'thriller', 'plenty', 'cool', 'toys', 'love', 'built-in', 'hand', 'phone', 'lots', 'action', ""'re"", 'wondering', '3-breasted', 'prostitute', 'original', 'up', 'here', 'too', 'fleeting', 'peek-a-boob', 'keeping', 'PG-13', 'rating']",N/A

I watched the extended version (which I love) and felt the video looked decent enough (maybe because of the lower bit rate?) but the colors just didn't pop out like they should for a 2013 blu ray. Good enough, I guess. I took the chance on getting this ""newer"" version transferred from 4K source (down to 1080p for standard blu ray) and was blown away after seeing this newer version. The colors really shine on this version and the detail is amazing! Most reviewers in high end web sites have stated they couldn't see or hear the difference. I know I sure can!! The 4K version is at much higher bit rate (maxing out at 42mbps or higher!) whereas the two versions on the first edition are crammed (with some special features)onto disc one. First offering they should have put each version on separate discs to maximize the bit rate. This is not just a typical drama/comedy here. This is eye-candy deluxe! The wonderful looking sets look immaculate on the 4K version and looking less so on the first edition.The sound seems to be amped up too in the surrounds on this 4K version. Disappointed they didn't take advantage and upgrade the soundtrack to 7.1 instead of typical Dolby True HD 5.1. The soundtrack is still only 48kz and not the higher 96/24 which would make it sound more alive and real. Hopefully with red ray 2160p in the horizon, Sony will up the ante on their so-so soundtracks.It is sad that Sony makes us higher end fans double dip so soon with this new release. Why did they not just release this one mastered from 4K source in the first place? Hope all new releases will be from 4K source from Sony in the future.If you are a fan of home theater, do yourself a favor and get this 4K version of Total Recall. Too bad its only the theatrical cut. But it sure looks and sound amazing.By the way, this region free disc has NO special features whatsoever. Really shows off with the higher bit rate.

There are enough differences between the two to enjoy both. I'm not against remakes in general, but I think they work better when they take a good idea from a movie or tv show that didn't quite work, rather than remake a largely successful film. That said, this one does pretty well.Colin Farrell replaces Arnold Schwarzenegger as Douglas Quaid, and his wife is now played by Kate Beckinsale. Colin is much more of the everyman than Arnold was in the role. The movie follows the same basic plot, with some small and large differences. There's no more mars, no more mutants vs. humans.

1480567,A3H6C20HUI178U,B005LAII3A,Mournblade14,"[2, 2]","A very tightly woven action flick. To fluff, no padding, pretty much non-stop action from start to finish. Comparisons to the Arnie version make the same mistake as with True Grit - neither are remakes but adaptations on the same original novel/short-story. Philip K Dick, who's amazing imagination sparked so many sic-fi movies, wrote this tale, this is a movie adaptation of it. THIS adaptation is closer to P.K.D's story than the previous version. It borrows from other movies but does so obviously in a respectful homage kind of way: we have Blade Runner (also Philip K.

This movie has dark broodish scenes that serve no purpose. The action and fighting scenes were mediocre to any other action movie today. The Original movie contained IN YOUR FACE action and true special effects, there were no dark night(cant see a thing) scenes.

It wasn't a great movie, but it was fun and had plenty of action and sci-fi goodness. I really didn't think it was due for a re-make, yet, and I really wasn't optimistic about the prospect of it being good. Why? Well, Colin Farrell isn't one of my favorite actors and re-makes are not often known to be much better than their predecessors. Still, it had my curiosity up and Redbox is so cheap it's hard to go wrong with a rental, so I gave it a try.I'm happy to report that this movie was far better than I expected it to be. The acting was good, the action was superb, the storyline was neat (though completely far-fetched), and the production and special effects were some of the best I've ever seen. In fact, it was the fictional world that was created for the story that totally sold me on the movie. So much time and attention to detail were put into creating this fictional living, breathing, functional futuristic world that IT, alone, is enough to grab your attention. The high-tech concepts that were brought to life through the magic of cinematic special effects and computer animation were really incredible. No matter how implausible the concepts were, you can't help but have fun with the movie because they were produced with such high quality and professionalism.Sci-Fi is always escapist in nature, and the production crew that brought this world to life deserve the utmost praise for how well they did their job. Much likeAvatar, the visuals in the movie upstaged the quality of the storyline. Yes, there was action aplenty and it was all thrilling. Yes, there are two beautiful women set in opposing roles that are sure to get the attention of many guys.

This was a GOOD/EXCITING sci-fi action movie.[DON'T watch the original before you go see this remake. It could spoil it.]In the future there only 2 places left to live on Earth: The United Federation of Britain (UFOB), and The Colony (the rest was destroyed by chemical warfare).  Story begins with Colin as a factory worker, married to Beckinsale who is like special military for the UFOB.Colin has a reoccurring disturbing nightmare where he knows he is part of something big (with Biel) and he gets captured and that's where he always wakes up.  He decides to go to ""Rekall"" to get a good memory so maybe he can stop having this nightmare, and there they discover he's a spy/agent. Immediately, all heck breaks loose and from there the action is pretty much non-stop.Colin makes it back to his wife and starts to tell her what happened - and discovers she was only pretending to be his wife, (what he thought was his life is a lie) and and now she is trying to kill him.  Beckinsale is awesome as a total unrelenting ""B"" on her ""A-game"" trying to kill him (even though she was ordered to take him alive).  Colin is trying to figure out who he is and what the heck is going on while attempting to stay alive (with some awesome fighting skill of his own), and he runs into Biel and together they fight/run and try to figure things out...  telling you more would probably ruin it, so I won't.Not an original STORY plot, but it was VERY GOOD ENTERTAINMENT.I saw this with my 22-yr old nephew and he gives it 4 stars.

So now this review is really a 2-fer and both are recommending it as entertaining.**NOTE TO PARENTS**There is 1 scene where a hooker tries to solicit Collin by showing her bare breasts (all 3 of them) but that's it for sexual content (unless you count seeing Biel in bikini underpants). The rest is action/violence.  No ""gore"" and very little blood in this - basically just scrapes/cuts - no big deal).Hope this review helped you.

Really?! The original was better? Even so, THAT DOESN'T MEAN THIS MOVIE WAS A ONE STAR PRODUCTION YOU IMBECILES!The problem with this movie is that the demographic they were trying to market to seem to have this irrational grudge against the new Total Recall. I believe this movie is NOT a remake. This movie is a RE-IMAGINING. One LARGE piece of evidence that supports my claim is that the story is TOTALLY different from the original. So you can't really call it a remake. It's a re-imagining. Sure, it's the same basic premise, but the two movies are so different you can't compare them which is what many of the bad reviewers seem to be doing.In all the reviews giving this movie below 3 stars are all whining about the same thing: ""the original was better."" That's the fatal flaw in their review. They set themselves up for failure when watching this movie if they were expecting a 1990's Total Recall with better graphics.There is NO WAY in hell this movie deserves ONE star. I mean just LOOK at it. This is NOT a one star film. It's AT LEAST a 3 star film. It's a clean production. Good graphics, gripping story, good acting, nice twist =! one star. Sure, the plot is a little shallow but that doesn't make the movie one star.Anyone that gives this movie one star is just a butthurt idiot that is oblivious to their hipster jealousy by saying ""the original was better"".

1480599,A16C1J5AW2CDRE,B005LAII3A,O Shepard,"[0, 0]","'Total Recall' does have great (if confusing) CGI, interesting art work, and a competent hard working cast. In all other aspects, the film is a failure.The 1990 version of 'Total Recall' starring Arnold Schwarzenegger and directed by Paul Verhoeven and the 2012 version starrng Colin Farrell and directed by Len Wiseman both claim to be based on the Philip K. Dick short story 'We Can Remember it for You Wholesale'. Readers of Philip K. Dick will understand that the films are actually very  meagerly based on the original story. Of the two versions, the 1990 film tried to present the essense of Philip K. Dick's philosophy and thinking.  Verhoeven was interested in Philip K. Dick and used humor and absurdities to make the viewer question the reality of the story presented. He incorporated Dick's political views (libertarianism, anti-corporate culture, and the evils of big government) as well as Dick's metaphysical and religous views. He prompts the filmviewer to ask if Quaid's adventure is real or is it all imaginary as part of his altered memory? Did it actually happen or was it all an hallucination?The nature of reality was a major theme in much of Philip K. Dick's works: What is reality? Verhoeven constructed his film to force the viewer to consider this question. Dick incorporated his personal drug-induced hallucinations into his stories and was even diagnosed as schizophrenic at one time. Verhoeven directed his film to include how Philip K. Dick saw the world. Verhoeven concluded his film without answering the big question of whether or not the story was real or imaginary. However he does indicate in the film's ending  that perhaps it does not really matter.So on to the 2012 version.The 2012 version does not even try to reflect the original intent of the short story or the 1990 film. It is a rewrite filled with intense action sequences, lots of CGI, and little plot. Philip K. Dick's literary imprint is all but gone although a case can be made that the dystopian background story was extracted from a number of other works by the author. We are given fast edits and  impossible fight scenes. The action scenes are so quickly cut that the viewer is confused about what is actually happening.  The background art that depicts a generally decaying urban cutlure is also so busy in interesting detail that it contributes to the distraction to what should be the center of attention - the story.  The two female leads, Jessica Biel and Kate Beckingsale, look so much alike, with similar hair style, hair color, body builld and form fitting black outfits, that is is difficult to tell them apart. And lastly, the use of constant CGI lens flare, as used in the Star Trek re-boot, is often inappropriate and distracts from what you see on the screen.Perhaps the best piece of video on the entire DVD is one of the extras - Michio Kaku's featurette called 'Science Fiction vs Science Fact', which not only is fascinating by itself, but also give us a clue to understand why the film fails in the end. The film is not a Philip K. Dick exploration of reality but a vision of a dystopian science fiction future.Not recommended.",2,Not an Update of the Original Film,1360886400,"02 15, 2013",2013,3148,"[""'Total"", 'Recall', 'have', 'great', 'confusing', 'CGI', 'interesting', 'art', 'work', 'competent', 'hard', 'working', 'cast', 'other', 'aspects', 'film', 'failure.The', '1990', 'version', ""'Total"", 'Recall', 'starring', 'Arnold', 'Schwarzenegger', 'directed', 'Paul', 'Verhoeven', '2012', 'version', 'starrng', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'directed', 'Len', 'Wiseman', 'claim', 'be', 'based', 'Philip', 'K.', 'Dick', 'short', 'story', 'Can', 'Remember', 'Wholesale', 'Readers', 'Philip', 'K.', 'Dick', 'will', 'understand', 'films', 'are', 'actually', 'very', 'meagerly', 'based', 'original', 'story', 'two', 'versions', '1990', 'film', 'tried', 'present', 'essense', 'Philip', 'K.', 'Dick', 'philosophy', 'thinking', 'Verhoeven', 'was', 'interested', 'Philip', 'K.', 'Dick', 'used', 'humor', 'absurdities', 'make', 'viewer', 'question', 'reality', 'story', 'presented', 'incorporated', 'Dick', 'political', 'views', 'libertarianism', 'anti-corporate', 'culture', 'evils', 'big', 'government', 'as', 'well', 'Dick', 'metaphysical', 'religous', 'views', 'filmviewer', 'ask', 'Quaid', 'adventure', 'real', 'imaginary', 'part', 'altered', 'memory', 'actually', 'happen', 'was', 'hallucination', 'nature', 'reality', 'was', 'major', 'theme', 'much', 'Philip', 'K.', 'Dick', 'works', 'What', 'reality', 'Verhoeven', 'constructed', 'film', 'force', 'viewer', 'consider', 'question', 'Dick', 'incorporated', 'personal', 'drug-induced', 'hallucinations', 'stories', 'was', 'even', 'diagnosed', 'schizophrenic', 'one', 'time', 'Verhoeven', 'directed', 'film', 'include', 'how', 'Philip', 'K.', 'Dick', 'saw', 'world', 'Verhoeven', 'concluded', 'film', 'answering', 'big', 'question', 'not', 'story', 'was', 'real', 'imaginary', 'However', 'indicate', 'film', 'ending', 'perhaps', 'not', 'really', 'matter.So', '2012', 'version.The', '2012', 'version', 'not', 'even', 'try', 'reflect', 'original', 'intent', 'short', 'story', '1990', 'film', 'rewrite', 'filled', 'intense', 'action', 'sequences', 'lots', 'CGI', 'little', 'plot', 'Philip', 'K.', 'Dick', 'literary', 'imprint', 'gone', 'case', 'can', 'be', 'made', 'dystopian', 'background', 'story', 'was', 'extracted', 'number', 'other', 'works', 'author', 'are', 'given', 'fast', 'edits', 'impossible', 'fight', 'scenes', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'so', 'quickly', 'cut', 'viewer', 'confused', 'what', 'actually', 'happening', 'background', 'art', 'generally', 'decaying', 'urban', 'cutlure', 'also', 'so', 'busy', 'interesting', 'detail', 'distraction', 'what', 'should', 'be', 'center', 'attention', 'story', 'two', 'female', 'leads', 'Jessica', 'Biel', 'Kate', 'Beckingsale', 'look', 'so', 'much', 'alike', 'similar', 'hair', 'style', 'hair', 'color', 'body', 'builld', 'form', 'fitting', 'black', 'outfits', 'difficult', 'tell', 'apart', 'lastly', 'use', 'constant', 'CGI', 'flare', 'used', 'Star', 'Trek', 're-boot', 'often', 'inappropriate', 'distracts', 'what', 'see', 'screen.Perhaps', 'best', 'piece', 'video', 'entire', 'DVD', 'one', 'extras', 'Michio', 'Kaku', 'featurette', 'called', 'Fiction', 'vs', 'Science', 'Fact', 'not', 'only', 'fascinating', 'also', 'give', 'clue', 'understand', 'why', 'film', 'end', 'film', 'not', 'Philip', 'K.', 'Dick', 'exploration', 'reality', 'vision', 'dystopian', 'science', 'fiction', 'future.Not', 'recommended']",N/A

The main focus is the visual special effects and the intense action and stunts.The PQ is very good, the only downside is the style and filter used for the bright lights streak across the screen, sort of like the trademark of director J.J. Abrams. It is very distracting and I almost thought something was wrong with my TV. The audio is Dolby TrueHD and for the most part it is nice and clean and crisp. It seemed to lack depth and dimension at times with the loud action scenes and gun fire, however over-all it sounds better than most and it was consistent throughout. The dialog was a little cheesy at times, but over-all wrapped up a fun movie.It could have used a little more humor and a slightly better story build up and character development, but for the most part Total Recall is hugely entertaining and a visual masterpiece.Very much deserves multiple viewings and a great action sci-fi popcorn flick.",4,"Visualy Stunning, Great Sci-fi Popcorn Flick",1355961600,"12 20, 2012",2012,1236,"['only', 'heard', 'bad', 'things', 're-imagining', 'Total', 'Recall', 'was', 'quite', 'hesitant', 'buy', 'however', 'due', 'fact', 'new', 'God', 'War', 'demo', 'came', 'blind', 'bought', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised.First', 'thing', 'not', 'same', 'story', 'original', 'Total', 'Recall', 'really', 'story', 'little', 'lacking', 'main', 'focus', 'visual', 'special', 'effects', 'intense', 'action', 'stunts.The', 'PQ', 'very', 'good', 'only', 'downside', 'style', 'filter', 'used', 'bright', 'lights', 'streak', 'screen', 'sort', 'trademark', 'director', 'J.J.', 'Abrams', 'very', 'distracting', 'almost', 'thought', 'something', 'was', 'wrong', 'TV', 'audio', 'Dolby', 'TrueHD', 'most', 'part', 'nice', 'clean', 'crisp', 'seemed', 'lack', 'depth', 'dimension', 'times', 'loud', 'action', 'scenes', 'gun', 'fire', 'however', 'over-all', 'better', 'most', 'was', 'consistent', 'dialog', 'was', 'little', 'cheesy', 'times', 'over-all', 'wrapped', 'up', 'fun', 'movie.It', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'little', 'more', 'humor', 'slightly', 'better', 'story', 'build', 'up', 'character', 'development', 'most', 'part', 'Total', 'Recall', 'hugely', 'entertaining', 'visual', 'masterpiece.Very', 'much', 'multiple', 'viewings', 'great', 'action', 'sci-fi', 'popcorn', 'flick']",N/A

The world of this Total Recall might not be Mars but it's a mesmerizing dystopian display. The Fall was very cool.The bad: the premise wasn't entirely believable, perhaps because it wasn't fully developed, while viewers may find they have little emotional connection to the characters. A big part of this was because Farrell was sort of like Rambo; I never really feared for his life. It always amazes me in how these types of movies the good guys can be fired at 1,000 times but most of the bullets miss, and the ones that hit often knick a shoulder blade, hand, or foot.The ugly: Um, who's idea was it to have a tri-breasted woman?

Len Wiseman also has far better taste in production design, costumes, and women than Paul Verhoeven.  That doesn't hurt.  The obvious visual influences did not bother me.  And I liked the concrete.  I'll admit, I did not get they were traveling through the center of the Earth with those ""The Fall"" transport machines.  I'm not sure I would have bought that if I'd caught onto it while watching.At about the half-way point, I started being not as entirely engaged in the characters as I could have been.  I'm not certain why that was.  My first hunch is that the opening scene convinced me the protagonist was already a super-spy and was a miscalculation in editing... or perhaps just the wrong scene to have used.  But that should have affected the first half, right?  Was it the robots?  I had a similar disconnect in I-Robot, too.  Hmm...  I still enjoyed this, but somewhere it lost me a little even when it held onto my attention.Looked amazing.  Action sequences I found to be very lucid and not overly frenetic.  And there are a few useful homages to the original film, including a neat little misdirect.  The score was good, too, but I heard hints of something better in there in the melodic layers and atmosphere that wasn't fully realized.  I felt the music had another level it could have achieved.  I was hearing the beginnings of a great score that just didn't quite pull off in the final pieces.Maybe the robots, combined with the less soaring musical moments, combined with a lack of really key beats in the actors' performances... a sort of lack of space and connecting that kept this film from being great.  Perhaps the characters just lacked depth that the subject matter & look of the film called for?  Come to think of it, both the female characters are rather 2D.  And I'm not sure the protagonist's vulnerability was fully fleshed out.  Just a thought.I went in looking for a deep sci-fi experience and all I got was a well-executed, visually-breathtaking action movie.  Not bad, but I felt it could have been something more.

That adds to the cool factor.  We have miss triple C. When Quaid passes through security, the lady in front of him is almost a twin to Arnold's disguise. The arm being chopped off in the elevator. Miss three boob. There's more, but I want to avoid spoilers.There are a LOT of continuity errors (watch the elevator chase scene carefully). One of the worst is the final scene on the drop ship.  How did their hardware (helicopters, etc.) change sides?!? Or not get totaled (clamps like the Green Hornet car used?) Also, lost of ""duh"" moments. Why would the ""colony"" evacuate to ""nozone shelters"" - the entire premise is that the nozone is uninhabitable and they don't have protection. If this society has antigravity and more highly advanced technology, why not expand the cities and clean up the polluted areas? How is it that the city is right next to and surrounded by a toxic environment - but the environment stays out? No dome. No technology. It just stays out. Drill THROUGH the earth? Because it's the ""only way"" to travel?!?OK, so let's ignore all that. It's an entertaining movie with fantastic special effects and original fight scenes. Plenty of chases, a close-quarters cat-fight, running gun battles, maglev car chase - you name it.  The first 20 minutes or so leading up to the Rekall visit are ""eh"" - pretty boring. After that, it's a rapid build up to almost non-stop action. This is a movie I'll definitely buy on BluRay - just to frame through the cityscape during the car chase. The amount of thought that went into urban design with access to anti-gravity is mind-blowing. The DETAILS throughout the movie - wow. Watch it once. Then watch it again with your finger on the pause button. Easter eggs galore. Lots of cool tech (including the touch-screen faced fridge.)It's not Arnold's Total Recall. In many way's it's better - it's decades later, so SFX have improved exponentially. In many ways it does not measure up.

Well, this is true; it is a vast viisual landscape with all the special effects you's expect (I watched the director's cut). The first half of the movie is fascinating and follows the original movie's plot nicely, with a few modificatons. For example, there is no Mars colony; the plot revolves around what's left of England, it's dominant corporation's antisocial personality, and his effort to take over territiory in Australia (connected by a completely bizarre and impossible &#34;fall&#34; through the earth transport in a giant tube). There are some interesting little homages to the original: the woman who precedes the hero through the scanner at the entry gate looks a lot like the woman who Quaid becomes to diguise himself at the Mars gate, for example. Little placements of liberal symbols make it into the movie, such as Obama's face on a stack of paper money in the safe depoit box.But half way through everything gets far too prodictible and the special effects wear thin. There are so many narrow escapes and knock-down drag out fights and explosions (without anyone getting a scratch) and impossible falls and jumps that the plot gets left behind. I began to predict the ending dynamics easily three fourths of the way through. There is the epic battle between hero and villan and the last ditch try by his non-wife to kill him. Ho-hum.

Jensen,"[0, 0]","I haven't seen the original, but I my whole reason for buying this and viewing it, was because I wanted to see a fun sci-fi movie with stuff blowing up. I got exactly that. I ended up really enjoying the film.The world really interested me, the special effects were spectacular, I loved the tone of the movie and how it kept changing from calmness to desperation and mysterious was great to me. The actors all did great playing their roles. Colin Farrell really impressed me as Quaid and I felt for the character. Kate Beckinsale felt pretty vicious and evil and Jessica Biel did great as a symphaetic character. The plot, although nothing special, really interested me and I felt the twists, although random, were appropreite.Now on the flip side, dispite enjoying the movie there are some problems with it. One is character development is weak one example being Colin Farrell and Jessica Biel's relationship. There isn't much to it, it's just there. While I do feel sympatheic towards Biel sometimes her emotions feel bland, but I'm not totally complaining as I was still engaged to what was happening. The final fight is another one of those fights where it feels like the producers wanted to include one more just for kicks. Finally the twists are random and kind of confusing as to who was fooled and what was the purpose of Quaid in the first place.So while I did enjoy it, the movie remains what I expected it to be...

Bottom line,sad to say,it couldn't ""convince"" me.Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:40:1 and is clear and crisp.Extras include about three featurettes,commentary and a gag reel.All in all a disappointing remake of the original starring Colin Farrell.Farrell just does not have the acting chops to compete with Ahh-nold from the original,nor make us forget the original and focus on HIS efforts.Biel and others he spends most of his on screen time with,are also tepid.Beckinsale is the exception and Nighy does a good but short turn as the resistance leader,but it is all for

This 2012 remake of the original ""Total Recall"" is a good example of this.  There is so much action in this flick that the viewer rarely has time to catch his or her breath and reflect on what the story is trying to tell us, i.e. what is reality and who, really, is our protagonist.  The original version is not exactly short on action but it does give the viewer a chance to reflect on what is going on.The film also takes idiotic liberties with the original Phillip K. Dick (""We Can Remember It for You Wholesale"") short story upon which this film is (supposedly) based.  In the original story and original film the protagonist had a yearning to go to Mars.  Here, there is no Mars; just some ambiguous political setup between something called ""The United Federation of Britain"" and ""the Colony.""  My son's reaction summed it up pretty well: ""who cares?""  I get it that the makers of this film felt a need to differentiate it from the original version.  In my opinion this change to the storyline was a distinct failure.The characterizations in this film left plenty to be desired as well.  The actresses are all skinny, dirty, good-looking (did I say skinny?) women who look so much the same that I had trouble telling them apart. Evidently in the future they will not be taking showers or even washing their hands.  There is no chemistry between anyone.  By the last 30 minutes I was more than ready for this film to end, which it (mercifully) finally did.This is a remake that should never have been made.  My son and I watched this New Year's Day and we both agreed that our time would have been better spent watching the original version.

First, the original was a landmark film for Computer Graphic special effects.  (It may have won the Academy award?)  This version is better because of the update effects throughout.  The first film looks a aged and boxy by comparison (technology).  The second reason I like this film better is Kate Beckinsale. (sic)  If movie villains make a movie then she deserves much of the credit for any success this movie enjoys.  As good as Sharon Stone was in the original, Beckinsale out does her in every category.  Who knew the Predator and the Terminator characters could be re-done, combined in a size 2!!I didn't give it four stars because the lead (Colin Farrell) played the Arnold (Shwartzeneggar) sic. role without ever trying to make anything of it.

1480686,A3EFSLEMHNPP6A,B005LAII3A,Senor Zoidbergo,"[132, 147]","I'm primarily interested in the storyline differences between the Director's Cut and its theatrical counterparts, so here are the differences between the two (NOTE: SPOILERS FOLLOW).The Director's Cut runs about 12 minutes longer than the theatrical cut.  No additional gore has been added although additional F-bombs have been added.  Ethan Hawke makes a surprise appearance in a scene that was cut from the theatrical movie.(1) Extra scene of Quaid meeting with a Human Resources Management representative from the Cohaagen administration who requests that he sign a non-disclosure agreement given that he works at a sensitive defense production factory.  (I can see why this was cut as it didn't add much to the overall storyline.)(2) Extra scene of scantily clad women in Rekall neighborhood.  (The three mammary gland-ed lady still makes the same appearance with topless nudity.)(3) In the scene where Quaid finds the hidden holographic piano recording in his apartment, it has been altered to show Ethan Hawke as the old Quaid, revealing that Cohaagen also gave Quaid facial reconstructive surgery. (This was an interesting twist which I wished they had left in.  It explains why no one was able to recognize him.)(4) When Quaid and Melina escape from Lori in the elevator action sequence, there is a re-inserted shot of the destroyed elevator plunging onto the roadway below and destroying a hover car.  (Pretty neat CGI!)(5) During the UFB assault on Matthias's base, there is an extra shot of a white combat synth gunning down some hapless Resistance members.(6) Melina is revealed to be Matthias's daughter.  Cohaagen also refers to Melina as Matthias's daughter, rather than lieutenant.(7) Cohaagen talks a little more about his plan to use Quaid to lead to Matthias, revealing that it was Quaid's idea to have his memory wiped in order to feign allegiance to Matthias.(8) When Cohaagen has Quaid strapped to the chair, Quaid instead yells an F-word laced expletive at Cohaagen.(9) When Cohaagen ponders what to do with Melina, she spits in his face and screams the F-word, whereas in the theatrical cut she says ""Never!""(10) The climactic final fight is slightly longer, showing an additional shot of UFB black-clad special forces troops getting gunned down by Melina and the fight between Cohaagen's black painted super-synth bodyguard and Quaid is slightly longer.And that's it.  The biggest addition is Ethan Hawke's reinserted scene.I enjoyed the Total Recall re-make, even if it lacked some of the campy humor and ridiculous gore of Paul Verhoeven's original.  I give it five stars for completely shallow reasons- Kate Beckinsale!  Hello.  Heck if I were Quaid and married to Kate Beckinsale I'd forget about Rekall.  Jessica Biel is easy on the eyes too.  The re-make is darker and more serious, akin to Minority Report meets Total Recall.  It seems to combine elements from both the Arnold film and Philip Dick's ""We Can Remember It For You Wholesale"".In a nod to the Verhoeven film, Harry and Quaid talk about going to Mars, a synthetic thug loses his arm, a similar looking ""two weeks"" woman walks by customs, Quaid uses holograms, Federal police engage in a zero-G gunbattle with Quaid, and the iconic three breasted woman makes an appearance.  Missing of course are the memorable Johnny Cab, Benny, the poor sap who gets perforated on the escalator, and Kuato.The action scenes are well staged even if TDI Vector sporting Federal police are mowed down like stormtroopers.  The technology is fascinating, especially ""The Fall"" and hand insertable phones.  The Colony's populace has a distinct Asian overtone and is more Blade Runner-esque.  The UFB is probably situated in England to make Beckinsale's native accent more convenient.I only wish they had made a hard R-version rather than pander to the PG-13 desires of studio executives.",5,Differences between the Director's Cut and the Theatrical Cut,1354752000,"12 6, 2012",2012,3858,"[""'m"", 'primarily', 'interested', 'storyline', 'differences', 'Director', 'Cut', 'theatrical', 'counterparts', 'so', 'here', 'are', 'differences', 'two', 'NOTE', 'SPOILERS', 'FOLLOW', '.The', 'Director', 'Cut', '12', 'minutes', 'longer', 'theatrical', 'cut', 'additional', 'gore', 'been', 'added', 'additional', 'F-bombs', 'have', 'been', 'added', 'Ethan', 'Hawke', 'surprise', 'appearance', 'scene', 'was', 'cut', 'theatrical', 'movie', '1', 'Extra', 'scene', 'Quaid', 'meeting', 'Human', 'Resources', 'Management', 'representative', 'Cohaagen', 'administration', 'who', 'sign', 'non-disclosure', 'agreement', 'given', 'sensitive', 'defense', 'production', 'factory', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'was', 'cut', 'did', ""n't"", 'add', 'much', 'overall', 'storyline', '2', 'Extra', 'scene', 'scantily', 'clad', 'women', 'Rekall', 'neighborhood', 'three', 'mammary', 'gland-ed', 'lady', 'still', 'same', 'appearance', 'topless', 'nudity', '3', 'scene', 'where', 'Quaid', 'hidden', 'holographic', 'piano', 'recording', 'apartment', 'been', 'altered', 'show', 'Ethan', 'Hawke', 'old', 'Quaid', 'revealing', 'Cohaagen', 'also', 'gave', 'Quaid', 'facial', 'reconstructive', 'surgery', 'was', 'interesting', 'twist', 'wished', 'had', 'left', 'why', 'one', 'was', 'able', 'recognize', '4', 'When', 'Quaid', 'Melina', 'escape', 'Lori', 'elevator', 'action', 'sequence', 're-inserted', 'shot', 'destroyed', 'elevator', 'plunging', 'roadway', 'destroying', 'hover', 'car', 'Pretty', 'neat', 'CGI', '5', 'UFB', 'assault', 'Matthias', 'base', 'extra', 'shot', 'white', 'combat', 'synth', 'gunning', 'down', 'hapless', 'Resistance', 'members', '6', 'Melina', 'revealed', 'be', 'Matthias', 'daughter', 'Cohaagen', 'also', 'Melina', 'Matthias', 'daughter', 'rather', 'lieutenant', '7', 'Cohaagen', 'talks', 'little', 'more', 'plan', 'use', 'Quaid', 'lead', 'Matthias', 'revealing', 'was', 'Quaid', 'idea', 'have', 'memory', 'wiped', 'order', 'feign', 'allegiance', 'Matthias', '8', 'When', 'Cohaagen', 'Quaid', 'strapped', 'chair', 'Quaid', 'instead', 'F-word', 'laced', 'expletive', 'Cohaagen', '9', 'When', 'Cohaagen', 'what', 'do', 'Melina', 'face', 'screams', 'F-word', 'whereas', 'theatrical', 'cut', 'Never', '10', 'climactic', 'final', 'fight', 'slightly', 'longer', 'showing', 'additional', 'shot', 'UFB', 'black-clad', 'special', 'forces', 'troops', 'getting', 'gunned', 'down', 'Melina', 'fight', 'Cohaagen', 'black', 'painted', 'super-synth', 'bodyguard', 'Quaid', 'slightly', 'longer.And', 'biggest', 'addition', 'Ethan', 'Hawke', 'reinserted', 'scene.I', 'enjoyed', 'Total', 'Recall', 're-make', 'even', 'lacked', 'campy', 'humor', 'ridiculous', 'gore', 'Paul', 'Verhoeven', 'original', 'give', 'five', 'stars', 'completely', 'shallow', 'reasons-', 'Kate', 'Beckinsale', 'Hello', 'Heck', 'were', 'Quaid', 'married', 'Kate', 'Beckinsale', ""'d"", 'forget', 'Rekall', 'Jessica', 'Biel', 'easy', 'eyes', 'too', 're-make', 'darker', 'more', 'serious', 'akin', 'Minority', 'Report', 'Total', 'Recall', 'combine', 'elements', 'Arnold', 'film', 'Philip', 'Dick', 'Can', 'Remember', 'Wholesale', 'nod', 'Verhoeven', 'film', 'Harry', 'Quaid', 'talk', 'going', 'Mars', 'synthetic', 'thug', 'arm', 'similar', 'looking', 'two', 'weeks', 'woman', 'walks', 'customs', 'Quaid', 'holograms', 'Federal', 'police', 'engage', 'zero-G', 'gunbattle', 'Quaid', 'iconic', 'three', 'breasted', 'woman', 'appearance', 'Missing', 'course', 'are', 'memorable', 'Johnny', 'Cab', 'Benny', 'poor', 'sap', 'who', 'perforated', 'escalator', 'Kuato.The', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'well', 'staged', 'even', 'TDI', 'Vector', 'sporting', 'Federal', 'police', 'are', 'mowed', 'stormtroopers', 'technology', 'fascinating', 'especially', 'Fall', 'hand', 'insertable', 'phones', 'Colony', 'populace', 'distinct', 'Asian', 'overtone', 'more', 'Blade', 'Runner-esque', 'UFB', 'probably', 'situated', 'England', 'make', 'Beckinsale', 'native', 'accent', 'more', 'convenient.I', 'only', 'wish', 'had', 'made', 'hard', 'R-version', 'rather', 'pander', 'PG-13', 'desires', 'studio', 'executives']",N/A

Of course the special effects were much better than the original film, but I have to admit that Arnold has such a presence that it makes it very hard to compete against him. Especially when you are playing the part he played so well in the original. However, Colin Farrel does do a good job playing the role of Douglas Quaid, or is it Hauser. I'm not really sure and that is the point of the movie. The cast is rounded out with Bryan Cranston fromBreaking Bad: The Complete First Seasonfame reprising the role originally played by veteran actor Ronny Cox and Jessica Biel as Hauser's love interest Melina played by Rachel Ticotin in the original film, and Bokeem Woodbine as Quaid's friend Harry.Now there are some obvious differences between the two films and without giving away in major spoilers, I am going to share a few of them with you here. So don't continue reading if you don't want to know some key plot elements in this new film.1. Sharon Stone's role from the original film is played devilishly and deliciously by Kate Beckinsale of theUnderworld: The Legacy Collectionfilms and plays her character all the way through the entire film up until the very end. Her character in this film is actually a combination of two characters from the original film. Of course as I already stated Sharon Stone's original role, but also the role of Michael Ironside as Richter in the original film. I thought this was a nicely added touch and I am sure you will as well. Beckinsale really gives her role some real viciousness as it seems only a female can.2. There is no relevance with the planet Mars in this version. All the events take place in what was once known as Europe and Australia.3. There are no ""mutants"" of any kind really shown or implied in the film.

1480704,A38VQ2TIPPBKNN,B005LAII3A,"Sir Charles Panther ""Life is hard.  It's hard...","[1, 2]","I figured it was going to be hard to get away fromVerhooven's original 1990 Total Recalland its cheezy, over-the-top charm, with the mutant prostitutes, comical asphyxiating robot faces, Arnold's wacky dramatic vocalizations and that dramatic instant terraforming of Mars.  This remake, with its non-Martian, non-mutant storyline departed from the original immediately and effectively, with occasional fun nods to the original, a nice ""two weeks"" take being just one.But unfortunately, in the end, literally, the ridiculous story devices and completely impossible physics ruined most of what it had going for it.  It's a fun diversion, but that's about it.The visual world is very cool, with some outstanding CGI.  A lot of the future tech is very good, quite imaginative, like embedded communication devices that project interactive interfaces onto any glass surface and a police gadget that penetrates a room and disperses uplinked mini video cameras to a man-portable router/screen.  Cool stuff.The maglev cars, featured in the Big Car Chase (BCC), just don't pass the common sense test.  Just like that horrible, horrible, audience-insulting device inStar Wars: Episode 1of fixing a submerged broken vehicle by tweaking a couple of wires in the center console, we get the same here, with the very nerve center of the sophisticated maglev car being right there in the center.  Awful.The BCC is all mag-levy, and is cool enough, but then Hauser dirves off the grid, literally falls away and gets away.  Why can't the bad guys do the same?  He falls down, so can't they just see him?  Or fall down, too?  Where are the flying units?  There are no ground units?  Radios?  And his lady is out cold in the passenger seat, with gawking locals all around him, and yet he somehow manages to get her up and out of the vehicle and away and into his apartment without any noticing where he's going?  Awful.In the end it's physics and logic that doom this film.  How is it that this ""Fall"" thingy passes through the Earth's core?  That's the diameter of the Earth, something like 7900 miles.  And in this movie the trip takes about 15 minutes.  Okay, kids, that's an average speed of . . . wait for it . . . 31,608 mph.  That's roughly Mach 45.  What kind of physical structure can travel at Mach 45, through a tunnel?  The physics of aerodynamics and atmospheric displacement make this impossible.  Imagine the heat generated by the air friction; the whole stupid thing would burst into flames at half that speed.  And then through the Earth's core, at 13,000 degrees F?  How is it the Earth's molten core doesn't just shoot out of the hole?  Wouldn't this make it difficult for our heroes to climb on the outside of the vehicle to escape the bad guys?And if I were a clever little Resistance fighter, and apparently Bill Nighy's miniscule role of Matthias is a smart rebel, I'd note that the only real threat to my domain is the vehicle that comes up through the hole, so why not bomb or disable or otherwise plug up the hole?  Hauser manages to do that all by himself with a few nicely placed explosives in the space of less than 15 minutes--why can't the rebels toss a huge bomb down the hole, drop a car or a truck or a rock or a piano or a good ol' fashioned Acme(tm) anvil down the hole?  At a closing speed better than 30,000 mph, any of those would do some damage, at least enough to take away the threat that is the basis for the entire story.And then there's the whole frantic elevator-shaft chase/fight thing.  As if people would design all of this without the slightest consideration of auto-stop systems in the event of obstructions in the pathways.  Awful, again.I like Brian Cranston, more hisMalcolm in the Middledad thanBreaking Badmethlord, so looked forward to this.  Cranston's got a lot to live up to in Ronny Cox's original Cohaagen, and he didn't get there.  The ridiculous big blond wig was the first indication; if you're going to guss up your character like that, then the character is going to have to be one seriously over the top bad guy (think Wez inThe Road Warrior).  But Cranston didn't make it, not even close.  Hauser is lauded throughout the film as the baddest of the badasses, yet when it comes down to the Big Final Fight, the two dudes mano-a-mano, somehow Cranston's over-coiffed bureaucrat is besting the ""greatest intelligence agent in the world?""  It was pathetic and ridiculous, a fight that ended completely predictably, but should have been over after the first swing.And in the water?  Water, on the top of a vehicle that just traveled at more than 31,000 mph right through the Earth's core?  Wouldn't it be a bit hot for water?  And how did it even get there?  It's just another lame movie gimmick to make lame slo-mo action look more than it really is.And am I the only who got a seriousBlade Runnervibe?  Farrell goes out to the balcony, cup in hand, just like Decker, to survey the nocturnal metropolis, only Colin is sans shirt and a lot more buff.  And the distinctly Asian feel in all of the street scenes, most of which are dark, and rainy, with Chinese and Japanese characters in neon in the background.  And a couple of times, I swear I was hearing what sounded like the ""Voight Kampf"" track from theVangelis BR soundtrack.  I guess it's imitative flattery, but it also comes across as unimaginative and derivative.Bottom line: this is perfectly fine escapist fare, attractive actors in cool action bits, with a still-intriguing story line, enhanced by some imaginative tech and good CGI.  But fundamental flaws in physics and tried-n-true Hollywood gimmicks spin it into the dustbin of future history.",3,Middling Recall,1368489600,"05 14, 2013",2013,5652,"['figured', 'was', 'going',

So this will be my first quality review of a blu ray DVD for which I never saw the film.  I received it as a holiday gift and watched it last night for the first time as the extended version.  Yes, there are many similarities between this remake and the original, which I have seen many times and still love, but I took this as a wholly different film.Enough folk here have discussed the differences and similarities of the film and voiced their opinions on the plot, acting and relevance so I only will provide a view of the quality of the Blu Ray film for both audio and video.The audio is the big star of this film as its True HD 5.1 fully utilizes the entire front and back sound stages and completely envelopes you in the action with excellent and appropriate use of the LFE sub channel and discreet directionality for all the surround channels. Actually, the audio may sometimes envelop you too much during some of the strongest action scenes, at least, that is what I felt.  The audio level is set higher than most so if you have a standard volume set that you usually use, you might need to notch it down but, either way, you won't find any complaints from me regarding this uncompressed audio.The video is very good and is signified by a cool color grading very similar to that used in iRobot.  There is excellent details in the dark and shadow areas as there should be since so much of this film was CGI, but there was no grain, artifacts or aliasing that I could see.  While you may have complaints about the film itself, you will not have complaints regarding either the audio or video.There are a ton of extras though I haven't watched them all as yet so no comment that would make a difference.All my movie reviews are of this nature and focus only on the quality of the transfer to BluRay so check them and see if they are of help as well.Hopefully, this review has been of some help to you in determining your purchase, hope I am on the correct path with a review of the transfer quality as opposed to providing plot summaries.Thanks",4,Total Recall (Three Discs: Blu-ray / DVD + UltraViolet Digital Copy),1356652800,"12 28, 2012",2012,2239,"['never', 'buy', 'disc', 'have', 'already', 'seen', 'liked', 'movie', 'already', 'have', 'Standard', 'Def', 'DVD', 'checked', 'see', 'upgrade', 'blu', 'ray', 'significant', 'improvement', 'will', 'be', 'first', 'quality', 'review', 'blu', 'ray', 'DVD', 'never', 'saw', 'film', 'received', 'holiday', 'gift', 'watched', 'last', 'night', 'first', 'time', 'extended', 'version', 'Yes', 'are', 'many', 'similarities', 'remake', 'original', 'have', 'seen', 'many', 'times', 'still', 'love', 'took', 'wholly', 'different', 'film.Enough', 'folk', 'here', 'have', 'discussed', 'differences', 'similarities', 'film', 'voiced', 'opinions', 'plot', 'acting', 'relevance', 'so', 'only', 'will', 'provide', 'view', 'quality', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'film', 'audio', 'video.The', 'audio', 'big', 'star', 'film', 'True', 'HD', '5.1', 'fully', 'entire', 'front', 'back', 'sound', 'stages', 'completely', 'envelopes', 'action', 'excellent', 'appropriate', 'use', 'LFE', 'sub', 'channel', 'discreet', 'directionality', 'surround', 'channels', 'Actually', 'audio', 'may', 'sometimes', 'envelop', 'too', 'much', 'strongest', 'action', 'scenes', 'least', 'what', 'felt', 'audio', 'level', 'set', 'higher', 'most', 'so', 'have', 'standard', 'volume', 'set', 'usually', 'use', 'might', 'need', 'notch', 'down', 'way', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'complaints', 'regarding', 'uncompressed', 'audio.The', 'video', 'very', 'good', 'signified', 'cool', 'color', 'grading', 'very', 'similar', 'used', 'iRobot', 'excellent', 'details', 'dark', 'shadow', 'areas', 'should', 'be', 'so', 'much', 'film', 'was', 'CGI', 'was', 'grain', 'aliasing', 'could', 'see', 'may', 'have', 'complaints', 'film', 'will', 'not', 'have', 'complaints', 'regarding', 'audio', 'are', 'ton', 'extras', 'have', ""n't"", 'watched', 'yet', 'comment', 'would', 'make', 'difference.All', 'movie', 'reviews', 'are', 'nature', 'focus', 'only', 'quality', 'transfer', 'BluRay', 'so', 'check', 'see', 'are', 'help', 'well.Hopefully', 'review', 'been', 'help', 'determining', 'purchase', 'hope', 'am', 'correct', 'path', 'review', 'transfer', 'quality', 'opposed', 'providing', 'plot', 'summaries.Thanks']",N/A

The story is still there, virtually unchanged (thank you for the hooker with 3 tits and the woman at customs who says 'two weeks' from the original!) I thought the acting was great, not that there was a whole lot of it, too busy shooting at each other! In fact, most of the story/character development took place mid-combat, but it was still there. Kate Beckinsale dogged Colin Farrell almost two solid hours in one long chase scene that managed to never get boring (10 points for originality in the zero-G gunfight). Another reviewer complains about Kate throwing Colin around like a rag-doll when he is supposed to be a better trained agent of twice her size and strength...yea there's two reasons for that: 1 - People want to see it. 2 - He is hesitant to kill her because the last thing he knew, she was his beloved wife! He is much more defending himself than really trying to take her down. Yes he shoots at her but its much easier (emotionally and physically) to shoot someone than to kill them with your bare hands, even if you know how. I saw this as part of his character development.

To put it simply: Arnold was better than Colin Farrell. Kate Beckinsale in the expanded role is better than Sharon Stone, and I really love them both. Jessica Biel is better than anyone, if you don't believe me, ask her. What I really liked about this film is the updated special effects, down to the electronic notes on the refrigerator door. I love attention to detail.The action was fast paced. The future looks similar to ""The Fifth Element"" but with more computer gizmos. If you have seen the original version, then you can miss the first few minutes of this one and be able to pick it up.For some reason they eliminated all the fun aspects of going to Mars. That is why we watched the first film. Instead we get a film where we simply root for the terrorists. The terrorists are revolting against the Chancellor who wants to replace workers with synthetics, although this theme was poorly developed.One of the aspects of both productions that I didn't like was the initial dream sequence. Had they eliminated that from both films, then the genius of the script would have been the ambiguity of reality vs. the recall machine.The film included 3D holograms, Star Wars stormtroopers, Bill Nighy for a brief moment, and an inadvertent mention of an old film ""Hauser's Memory.""What I didn't like about this film was all the action. It didn't have drama scenes outside of the beginning. No colorful characters. No time for a Biel/ Farrell love scene. It was like watching someone play a video game. Seriously, where was the writing? The clever lines? The complex character? The relationship?

1480746,A1KMG1AIUS00DC,B005LAII3A,"The Movie Man ""tenebre89""","[1, 1]","""Total Recall"" is a remake of the 1990 sci-fi film that starred Arnold Schwarzenegger.  Because of its success, Hollywood decided to dust it off, reboot it, make a few changes, and present it as a summer action alternative to ""The Dark Knight Rises.""Based on the Philip K. Dick novel ""We Can Remember It For You Wholesale,"" the current ""Total Recall"" is set in a future world comprised of two superstates, the United Federation of Britain and The Colony.  The Colony's inhabitants must travel from their bleak, overcrowded neighborhoods to their factory jobs in the wealthy Federation via the Earth's only remaining means of long-distance travel -- the Fall, a huge elevator/tram that drops through the core of the Earth and deposits its passengers on the other side. The entire journey takes a mere 17 minutes, far better than a daily commute across the GW Bridge in 2012.Because life is dull, a company called Rekall offers to provide customers with vivid memories of pleasurable experiences. Colony-dweller Doug Quaid (Colin Farrell), dreaming of a more exciting and glamorous life, ignores the warnings of a co-worker and visits Rekall, where he pays for a chemical implant that will give him an artificially induced memory of an exciting past. In the midst of the treatment, however, all hell breaks loose when armed robot police break in and start shooting the place up.  Miraculously, and for reasons unknown to him, Doug manages to destroy a pile of these deadly adversaries in breakneck time.  How can he do this?  Where did he learn the skills?  Is this reality?  A memory?  A combination?So goes the rest of the movie, an above-average action flick with more than its share of twists and turns.  As you watch, you'll notice borrowings from other sci-fi films. The sunless, rain-soaked landscapes are right out of ""Blade Runner;"" the white-clad robot police are clones of the ""Star Wars"" stormtroopers; a gravity-less sequence is reminiscent of the hotel corridor sequence in ""Inception;"" images of the Colony's occupier, Cohagen (Brian Cranston), appear on giant screens everywhere, in clear homage to ""1984;"" and the daily drudgery of the workers comes right from Fritz Lang's ""Metropolis.""Farrell plays Quaid as a nondescript Everyman. Farrell's cinematic stature does not yet match that of brighter lights Tom Cruise or Harrison Ford, and that helps us accept Doug as the poor schlub next door who gets himself into a pretty complicated fix.  Hitchcock never did science fiction, but he'd likely enjoy the plot -- an innocent gets involved in an immensely sticky lethal mess and must work his way out of it. The story draws us in and holds us, and director Len Wiseman keeps the pace brisk and lively with enough action for two pictures.The standout performance in ""Total Recall"" is from Kate Beckinsale as Doug's wife, who has an agenda all her own. The role has many intriguing facets, which will not be revealed here.  Ms. Beckinsale does so much running, fighting, chasing, and shooting that she resembles a computer-generated video game avatar, but gets to convey enough human emotion to keep her character reasonably grounded.The dialogue in Kurt Wimmer and Mark Bomback's script is frequently pedestrian and ordinary.  The 1990 version had humor, even campiness tossed in, making it a unique experience.  The present ""Total Recall"" takes itself far more seriously, with tremendous effort (and money) devoted to elaborate action sequences.  When it comes to an award for cleverness or sparkle, the scriptwriters might as well stay home.The production design by Patrick Tatopoulos is striking.  The Fall, in particular, is impressive and includes lots of interesting details that make such a contraption plausible. The intercutting of live action and real sets with the CGI imagery is smooth, and when the computer-generated shots are shown, there is always a slightly panning camera movement to make them appear more authentic.Rated PG-13 for violence and language, ""Total Recall"" is a journey of the mind set in a futuristic time.  When compared with other sci-fi movies, it doesn't rank with the best.  As an action film, however, it offers a two-hour thrill ride.Bonus extras on the two-disc Blu-ray edition include several behind-the-scenes featurettes, digital copy, and gag reel.  There are also single-disc and three-disc Blu-ray editions. The latter contains all the extras on the two-disc edition as well as a DVD version.",3,Trusting one's memory can be lethal,1355961600,"12 20, 2012",2012,4451,"['Total', 'Recall', 'remake', '1990', 'sci-fi', 'film', 'starred', 'Arnold', 'Schwarzenegger', 'success', 'Hollywood', 'decided', 'dust', 'off', 'reboot', 'make', 'few', 'changes', 'present', 'summer', 'action', 'alternative', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'Rises', 'Based', 'Philip', 'K.', 'Dick', 'novel', 'Can', 'Remember', 'Wholesale', 'current', 'Total', 'Recall', 'set', 'future', 'world', 'comprised', 'two', 'superstates', 'United', 'Federation', 'Britain', 'Colony', 'Colony', 'inhabitants', 'must', 'travel', 'bleak', 'overcrowded', 'neighborhoods', 'factory', 'jobs', 'wealthy', 'Federation', 'Earth', 'only', 'remaining', 'means', 'long-distance', 'travel', 'Fall', 'huge', 'elevator/tram', 'core', 'Earth', 'passengers', 'other', 'side', 'entire', 'journey', 'mere', '17', 'minutes', 'far', 'better', 'daily', 'commute', 'GW', 'Bridge', '2012.Because', 'life', 'dull', 'company', 'called', 'Rekall', 'provide', 'customers', 'vivid', 'memories', 'pleasurable', 'experiences', 'Colony-dweller', 'Doug', 'Quaid', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'dreaming', 'more', 'exciting', 'glamorous', 'life', 'warnings', 'co-worker', 'visits', 'Rekall', 'where', 'chemical', 'implant', 'will', 'give', 'artificially', 'induced', 'memory', 'exciting', 'past', 'midst', 'treatment', 'however', 'hell', 'breaks', 'loose', 'when', 'armed', 'robot', 'police', 'break', 'start', 'shooting', 'place', 'up', 'Miraculously', 'reasons', 'unknown', 'Doug', 'destroy', 'pile', 'deadly', 'adversaries', 'breakneck', 'time', 'How', 'can', 'do', 'Where', 'did', 'learn', 'skills', 'reality', 'memory', 'combination', 'So', 'rest', 'movie', 'above-average', 'action', 'flick', 'more', 'share', 'twists', 'turns', 'watch', ""'ll"", 'notice', 'borrowings', 'other', 'sci-fi', 'films', 'sunless', 'rain-soaked', 'landscapes', 'are', 'right', 'Blade', 'Runner', 'white-clad', 'robot', 'police', 'are', 'clones', 'Star', 'Wars', 'stormtroopers', 'gravity-less', 'sequence', 'reminiscent', 'hotel', 'corridor', 'sequence', 'Inception', 'images', 'Colony', 'occupier', 'Cohagen', 'Brian', 'Cranston', 'appear', 'giant', 'screens', 'everywhere', 'clear', 'homage', '1984', 'daily', 'drudgery', 'workers', 'right', 'Fritz', 'Lang', 'Metropolis', 'Farrell', 'Quaid', 'nondescript', 'Everyman', 'Farrell', 'cinematic', 'stature', 'not', 'yet', 'match', 'brighter', 'lights', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'accept', 'Doug', 'poor', 'schlub', 'next', 'door', 'who', 'pretty', 'complicated', 'fix', 'Hitchcock', 'never', 'did', 'science', 'fiction', ""'d"", 'likely', 'enjoy', 'plot', 'innocent', 'involved', 'immensely', 'sticky', 'lethal', 'mess', 'must', 'work', 'way', 'story', 'director', 'Len', 'Wiseman', 'pace', 'brisk', 'lively', 'enough', 'action', 'two', 'pictures.The', 'standout', 'performance', 'Total', 'Recall', 'Kate', 'Beckinsale', 'Doug', 'wife', 'who', 'agenda', 'own', 'role', 'many', 'intriguing', 'facets', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'revealed', 'here', 'Ms.', 'Beckinsale', 'so', 'much', 'running', 'fighting', 'chasing', 'shooting', 'computer-generated', 'video', 'game', 'avatar', 'convey', 'enough', 'human', 'emotion', 'keep', 'character', 'reasonably', 'grounded.The', 'dialogue', 'Kurt', 'Wimmer', 'Mark', 'Bomback', 'script', 'frequently', 'pedestrian', 'ordinary', '1990', 'version', 'had', 'humor', 'even', 'campiness', 'tossed', 'making', 'unique', 'experience', 'present', 'Total', 'Recall', 'far', 'more', 'seriously', 'tremendous', 'effort', 'money', 'devoted', 'elaborate', 'action', 'sequences', 'When', 'award', 'cleverness', 'sparkle', 'scriptwriters', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'stay', 'home.The', 'production', 'design', 'Patrick', 'Tatopoulos', 'striking', 'Fall', 'particular', 'impressive', 'lots', 'interesting', 'details', 'make', 'contraption', 'plausible', 'intercutting', 'live', 'action', 'real', 'sets', 'CGI', 'imagery', 'smooth', 'when', 'computer-generated', 'shots', 'are', 'shown', 'always', 'slightly', 'panning', 'camera', 'movement', 'make', 'appear', 'more', 'authentic.Rated', 'PG-13', 'violence', 'language', 'Total', 'Recall', 'journey', 'mind', 'set', 'futuristic', 'time', 'When', 'compared', 'other', 'sci-fi', 'movies', ""n't"", 'rank', 'best', 'action', 'film', 'however', 'two-hour', 'thrill', 'extras', 'two-disc', 'Blu-ray', 'edition', 'include', 'several', 'behind-the-scenes', 'featurettes', 'digital', 'copy', 'gag', 'reel', 'are', 'also', 'single-disc', 'three-disc', 'Blu-ray', 'editions', 'latter', 'extras', 'two-disc', 'edition', 'as', 'well', 'DVD', 'version']",N/A

Sipos,"[3, 5]","This remake demonstrates how to make a REALLY BAD action film -- and there are a lot of them out there!The main problem is that this film is missing the HUMAN ELEMENT. There are no CHARACTERS we can love, hate, admire, or care about in any way. They're all one-dimensional stick figures. And if you don't care about the characters, you can't be engaged in their struggle.The script is so SIMPLISTIC, in a typically bad action movie way. The evil (dictatorship, corporation, empire, military, whatever) is entirely evil. The good guys (rebels, resistance, revolutionaries, whatever) are entirely noble. No nuances, moral dilemmas, etc. Compare that toThe Dark Knight, in which Batman's moral role as a vigilante was questioned, the Joker observing that Batman was seen as a freak by the very people he was defending.Even worse, in this TOTAL RECALL remake (and in a typically bad action film sort of way), no good guy is AT RISK. It's one of those films where hundreds of (storm troopers, soldiers, gangsters, whatever) shoot a bajillion zillion bullets the Good Guy, and not one of them strikes. And because you KNOW that not a single bullet will hit the Good Guy, there's ZERO SUSPENSE. This film was just one long, extended, two-hour chase sequence/gun battle, yet despite that, I was BORED.Any ONE slasher in a horror film racks up a higher body count that the literally hundreds of evil robots shooting a bajillion bullets in this TOTAL RECALL remake. Isn't it sad, when a low-budget slasher film is actually more suspenseful and exciting than this ($100 million plus?) studio effort?Compare this TOTAL RECALL remake to one of the best action films ever:The Rock. There you had not two sides, but five ""sides"" -- most of them complex and morally ambiguous. A film full of twists and surprises. There was the 1. Terrorist/Military Hero, who had noble motives and whose intent turned out to be decent, 2. the Establishment Cops who were fighting the terrorist, yet through immoral means, 3. the Hero Cop, Nicolas Cage, who betrayed his cop bosses, 4, the Prisoner, Sean Connery, a villain who was charged with rescuing the day from the terrorist, and 5. the Terrorist Rebels, who suddenly betrayed their leader, for even more immoral reasons and intent.The fewer chases and pyrotechnics inThe Rockwere more exciting, because I cared about its morally complex characters/sides, and was constantly surprised by unexpected plot twists.Whereas this TOTAL RECALL remake was one long, paint-by-number, predictable snoozefest. While watching the incessant chases, I was actually wondering about the CGI budget, and various other things, instead of being emotionally involved with the events onscreen.",1,BORING -- how NOT to do an action film,1380672000,"10 2, 2013",2013,2695,"['remake', 'how', 'make', 'REALLY', 'BAD', 'action', 'film', 'are', 'lot', 'there', 'main', 'problem', 'film', 'missing', 'HUMAN', 'ELEMENT', 'are', 'CHARACTERS', 'can', 'love', 'hate', 'admire', 'care', 'way', ""'re"", 'one-dimensional', 'stick', 'figures', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'characters', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'engaged', 'struggle.The', 'script', 'so', 'SIMPLISTIC', 'typically', 'bad', 'action', 'movie', 'way', 'evil', 'dictatorship', 'corporation', 'empire', 'military', 'entirely', 'evil', 'good', 'guys', 'rebels', 'resistance', 'revolutionaries', 'are', 'entirely', 'noble', 'nuances', 'moral', 'dilemmas', 'etc', 'Compare', 'toThe', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'Batman', 'moral', 'role', 'vigilante', 'was', 'questioned', 'Joker', 'observing', 'Batman', 'was', 'seen', 'freak', 'very', 'people', 'was', 'defending.Even', 'worse', 'TOTAL', 'RECALL', 'remake', 'typically', 'bad', 'action', 'film', 'sort', 'way', 'good', 'guy', 'AT', 'RISK', 'one', 'films', 'where', 'hundreds', 'storm', 'troopers', 'soldiers', 'gangsters', 'shoot', 'bajillion', 'zillion', 'Good', 'Guy', 'not', 'one', 'strikes', 'KNOW', 'not', 'single', 'bullet', 'will', 'hit', 'Good', 'Guy', 'ZERO', 'SUSPENSE', 'film', 'was', 'just', 'one', 'long', 'extended', 'two-hour', 'chase', 'sequence/gun', 'battle', 'was', 'BORED.Any', 'ONE', 'slasher', 'horror', 'film', 'up', 'higher', 'body', 'count', 'literally', 'hundreds', 'evil', 'robots', 'shooting', 'bajillion', 'TOTAL', 'RECALL', 'remake', ""n't"", 'sad', 'when', 'low-budget', 'slasher', 'film', 'actually', 'more', 'suspenseful', 'exciting', '100', 'million', 'studio', 'effort', 'Compare', 'TOTAL', 'RECALL', 'remake', 'one', 'best', 'action', 'films', 'ever', 'Rock', 'had', 'not', 'two', 'sides', 'five', 'sides', 'most', 'complex', 'morally', 'ambiguous', 'film', 'full', 'twists', 'surprises', 'was', '1', 'Terrorist/Military', 'Hero', 'who', 'had', 'noble', 'motives', 'intent', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'decent', '2.', 'Establishment', 'Cops', 'who', 'were', 'fighting', 'terrorist', 'immoral', 'means', '3.', 'Hero', 'Cop', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'who', 'betrayed', 'cop', 'bosses', '4', 'Prisoner', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'villain', 'who', 'was', 'charged', 'rescuing', 'day', 'terrorist', '5.', 'Terrorist', 'Rebels', 'who', 'suddenly', 'betrayed', 'leader', 'even', 'more', 'immoral', 'reasons', 'intent.The', 'fewer', 'chases', 'pyrotechnics', 'inThe', 'Rockwere', 'more', 'exciting', 'cared', 'morally', 'complex', 'characters/sides', 'was', 'constantly', 'surprised', 'unexpected', 'plot', 'TOTAL', 'RECALL', 'remake', 'was', 'one', 'long', 'paint-by-number', 'predictable', 'snoozefest', 'watching', 'incessant', 'was', 'actually', 'wondering', 'CGI', 'budget', 'various', 'other', 'things', 'instead', 'being', 'emotionally', 'involved', 'events', 'onscreen']",N/A

1480754,A3DZCNEU21MB6L,B005LAII3A,"THowerton ""SHowT""","[0, 2]","First off, ignore the 1 star reviews.  That just smacks of misguided and disappointed expectation and isn't a fair critique of this film.  Secondly, for folks who enjoyed movies such as ""Blade Runner"", ""Minority Report"", ""Equilibrium"", and even ""I, Robot"" you're in the same ballpark here and should enjoy this film (and, no, of course it isn't nearly as good as ""Blade Runner"" but there isn't much that is).While the original Recall was a gonzo Ahunuld vehicle full of mean-spirited violence, neon trash character riff raff, and brilliant flip-you-on-your-head storytelling (yes, I think the 1990 Recall is a more enjoyable movie than this one--5 stars on it) this new Farrell, Beckinsale, and Biel vehicle is a more straightforward and grounded dystopian future action flick.  It doesn't want to be a rehash of the original and it's not trying to quite be an updated photocopy either but it does give some nice nods to the 1990 version (the tri-breasted woman makes an appearance; a hologram scrambler doesn't quite help get Quaid past transport security) while maintaining a similar storyline and it also has some nice touches of its own (like early in the film when we see Quaid reading a copy of Ian Fleming's ""The Spy Who Loved Me"" not yet knowing that he himself is a double-agent or that his wife too is an agent).The beginning of the film gives us an all-too-brief history lesson bringing us up to the dismal present and then the film starts us off proper by by reorienting our disoriented perspective when we see Farrell's Quaid in close-up appearing to be in a buried alive situation only to have the camera rotate over and pull back to show us a frantic Quaid laying belly down on the floor.  I'm going to leave it there and not spoil more but I will admit that there are a few little details that the film slyly highlights well enough to allow the intelligent adult viewer to fairly easily follow the narrative and get the plot the first time through without any real hangups (I don't recall the original movie letting us get away with that).  Also, even as Hollywood so often does in making use of cheap ploys by throwing us macguffins and red herrings that are there merely to confuse and disorient us, I appreciate that this movie remains constrained.  It allows the initial plot point of a submerged double identity coming back to the fore to be the real and honest disorientation, which is enough for us to experience without the extra contrivances that could have been pulled in just to leave us dazed and confused and going ""whoa...uh, what?""  Thankfully this movie doesn't bend us in that direction.As for the actors, Farrell's Quaid/ Hauser is a muted and quiet hero here.  He is full of physical action but he isn't overimposing.  Beckinsale, on the other hand, is hotcha!!!  Yowza!!!  She is a treat to watch and an extremely awesome action actress.  She is really great as a determined bad/ good guy in this film.  This movie is at its best when she and Farrell share the screen.  Our other significant female lead, Jessica Biel, plays Melina who is one of the resistance's leads.  Biel, who is herself strikingly beautiful, has her stunning attractiveness dirtied out (sorry, guys).  Bill Nighy makes a rather inconsequential appearance as the resistance's leader, Bokeem Woodbine plays Farrell's undercover co-worker, and Bryan Cranston rounds out the cast as the power-mad Cohaagen (Cransten, a superb actor, has his talents wasted here).  One of the film's most glaring failings is that we are not given any real substance as to why Cohaagen wants to take over and essentially dispose of a certain population area other than a generic ""it's class warfare"" explanation that really doesn't fit in the scheme of this film given what's going on with the earth.Still, it was an enjoyable ride.

As to the differences between two versions, I only say that there is much less humor in the new version than in Paul Verhoeven's sci-fi classic. You will see no Johnny Cab, one of the most memorable taxi drivers in the movie history. What you get instead is a more straightforward sci-fi action directed by Len Wiseman.The plotline itself is basically the same. Colin Farrell is a factory worker Douglas Quaid, living with his beautiful wife Lori (Kate Beckinsale). Fed up with the monotonous life, Doug visits a memory implanting company ""Rekall,"" where he discovers a few unsettling secrets about himself.I hate it when a film begins with a long, expository pre-credit text like ""In the year 2525,"" especially when it is unconvincing and boring. The 2012 ""Total Recall"" opens with such a text explaining that by the end of this century, the only habitable places for humans are the ""United Federation of Britain"" and ""The Colony"" (today's Australia). The two areas are connected by a massive elevator called ""The Fall."" So, humans can build a gravity elevator traveling through the Earth's core, but cannot cleanse the contaminated soil.Len Wiseman's new ""Total Recall"" may look great with the cutting-edge visual effects, but its ideas are badly assorted. The story is dull with a few lapses in logic and Colin Farrell's uninteresting protagonist Douglas Quaid. Villains lack charisma. Each action set-piece is slick, but short on imagination. Hovercars may look real, but the action and the city always remind us of other sci-fi films like ""Blade Runner"" and ""Minority Report"" (both based on P. K. Dick stories).""Total Recall"" is a serviceable action film, but is much tamer and less unique than you might want it to be.",3,Action-Packed and Reasonably Entertaining But Short on Humor and Imagination,1344556800,"08 10, 2012",2012,1895,"['Total', 'Recall', '2012', 'reasonably', 'entertaining', 'forgettable', 'remake', '1990', 'film', 'destined', 'be', 'compared', 'predecessor', 'starring', 'Arnold', 'Schwarzenegger', 'differences', 'two', 'versions', 'only', 'say', 'much', 'less', 'humor', 'new', 'version', 'Paul', 'Verhoeven', 'sci-fi', 'classic', 'will', 'see', 'Johnny', 'Cab', 'one', 'most', 'memorable', 'taxi', 'drivers', 'movie', 'history', 'What', 'get', 'instead', 'more', 'straightforward', 'sci-fi', 'action', 'directed', 'Len', 'Wiseman.The', 'plotline', 'basically', 'same', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'factory', 'worker', 'Douglas', 'Quaid', 'living', 'beautiful', 'wife', 'Lori', 'Kate', 'Beckinsale', 'Fed', 'up', 'monotonous', 'life', 'Doug', 'memory', 'implanting', 'company', 'Rekall', 'where', 'few', 'unsettling', 'secrets', 'himself.I', 'hate', 'when', 'film', 'long', 'expository', 'pre-credit', 'text', 'year', '2525', 'especially', 'when', 'unconvincing', 'boring', '2012', 'Total', 'Recall', 'text', 'explaining', 'end', 'century', 'only', 'habitable', 'places', 'humans', 'are', 'United', 'Federation', 'Britain', 'Colony', 'today', 'Australia', 'two', 'areas', 'are', 'connected', 'massive', 'elevator', 'called', 'Fall', 'So', 'humans', 'can', 'build', 'gravity', 'elevator', 'traveling', 'Earth', 'core', 'can', 'not', 'cleanse', 'contaminated', 'soil.Len', 'Wiseman', 'new', 'Total', 'Recall', 'may', 'look', 'great', 'cutting-edge', 'visual', 'effects', 'ideas', 'are', 'badly', 'assorted', 'story', 'dull', 'few', 'lapses', 'logic', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'uninteresting', 'protagonist', 'Douglas', 'Quaid', 'Villains', 'lack', 'charisma', 'action', 'set-piece', 'slick', 'short', 'imagination', 'Hovercars', 'may', 'look', 'real', 'action', 'city', 'always', 'remind', 'other', 'sci-fi', 'films', 'Blade', 'Runner', 'Minority', 'Report', 'based', 'P.', 'K.', 'Dick', 'stories', 'Total', 'Recall', 'serviceable', 'action', 'film', 'much', 'tamer', 'less', 'unique', 'might', 'want', 'be']",N/A

Dick short story ""We Can Remember It For You Wholesale"" is a much more faithful adaptation of the tale than the Arnold version. It's clear the director was also a fan of Blade Runner, another film based off of Dick's work, because it has the same gloomy atmosphere about it. This depiction of the future is dark and the film heads into noir territory, a complete turn from the lighthearted action film Arnold made in the 90's.Colin Farrell has been having dreams of visiting Mars, and he feels an urge to experience these dreams. But he's not a rich guy, just a regular worker, so a vacation to Mars is too expensive for him. Enter Total Recall, a company that specializes in implanting false meories inside a client's head to make him/her have memories of a trip they did in actuality not make.Farrell goes to the business, gets strapped in a chair and decides he wants to go to Mars as a double agent. After he's injected, things go very wrong.This is a great take on Dick's short story and is filled with a gritty, seedy atmosphere. It has nice action, the acting is good, and the film is way underrated, no doubt due to fans of Arnold's Total Recall.A huge letdown for the original Total Recall fans is the fact that Douglas Quaid (Farrell) doesn't go to Mars in the 2012 remake.Don't expect a remake of the Arnold Schwarzenegger version, and you should really enjoy this movie.",5,Really Surprised By This Movie,1349740800,"10 9, 2012",2012,1409,"['take', 'Philip', 'K.', 'Dick', 'short', 'story', 'Can', 'Remember', 'Wholesale', 'much', 'more', 'faithful', 'adaptation', 'tale', 'Arnold', 'version', 'clear', 'director', 'was', 'also', 'fan', 'Blade', 'Runner', 'film', 'based', 'Dick', 'work', 'same', 'gloomy', 'atmosphere', 'depiction', 'future', 'dark', 'film', 'heads', 'noir', 'territory', 'complete', 'turn', 'lighthearted', 'action', 'film', 'Arnold', 'made', ""90's.Colin"", 'Farrell', 'been', 'having', 'dreams', 'visiting', 'Mars', 'urge', 'experience', 'dreams', 'not', 'rich', 'guy', 'just', 'regular', 'worker', 'vacation', 'Mars', 'too', 'expensive', 'Enter', 'Total', 'Recall', 'company', 'implanting', 'false', 'meories', 'client', 'head', 'make', 'him/her', 'have', 'memories', 'trip', 'did', 'actuality', 'not', 'make.Farrell', 'business', 'strapped', 'chair', 'go', 'Mars', 'double', 'agent', 'injected', 'things', 'go', 'very', 'wrong.This', 'great', 'take', 'Dick', 'short', 'story', 'filled', 'gritty', 'seedy', 'atmosphere', 'nice', 'action', 'acting', 'good', 'film', 'way', 'underrated', 'doubt', 'due', 'fans', 'Arnold', 'Total', 'Recall.A', 'huge', 'letdown', 'original', 'Total', 'Recall', 'fans', 'fact', 'Douglas', 'Quaid', 'Farrell', ""n't"", 'go', 'Mars', '2012', 'remake.Do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'remake', 'Arnold', 'Schwarzenegger', 'version', 'should', 'really', 'enjoy', 'movie']",N/A
