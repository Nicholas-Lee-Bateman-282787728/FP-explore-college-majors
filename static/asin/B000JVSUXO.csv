I can't compare this movie to legendary Chinese movies from the past because I haven't seen any.  What I can say is that his movie is beautiful!!!  the story is whimsical and very imaginative, it's hard to follow at times but then everything settles into place and some things are left cloudy but you can still enjoy the movie thoroughly.  I recommend this movie to anyone that enjoys beautiful cinematic Chinese martial arts films.  the CG has some parts that are hard to believe but they're bearable.  I loved it and you might too.  I haven't seen crouching tiger or house of flying daggers in years so I can't compare them to this, so I would recommend you not comparing them as well, each movie can stand on its own and it's not fair to compare movies like these.  rent it and you'll like it.",4,TRULY AVOID THE IMDB OPINIONS,1167868800,"01 4, 2007",2007,948,"['need', 'realize', 'movie', 'lot', 'Chinese', 'movies', 'apparently', 'are', 'far', 'better', 'IMDB', 'crowd', 'apparently', 'so', 'least', 'ca', ""n't"", 'compare', 'movie', 'legendary', 'Chinese', 'movies', 'past', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'What', 'can', 'say', 'movie', 'beautiful', 'story', 'whimsical', 'very', 'imaginative', 'hard', 'follow', 'times', 'then', 'everything', 'settles', 'place', 'things', 'are', 'left', 'cloudy', 'can', 'still', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'thoroughly', 'recommend', 'movie', 'anyone', 'beautiful', 'cinematic', 'Chinese', 'martial', 'arts', 'films', 'CG', 'parts', 'are', 'hard', 'believe', ""'re"", 'bearable', 'loved', 'might', 'too', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'crouching', 'tiger', 'house', 'flying', 'daggers', 'years', 'so', 'ca', ""n't"", 'compare', 'would', 'recommend', 'not', 'comparing', 'as', 'well', 'movie', 'can', 'stand', 'own', 'not', 'fair', 'compare', 'movies', 'rent', ""'ll"", 'like']",The Promise

What's the point?), so I can't comment on what might be left out in the shorter version.  Personally, I thought ""The Promise"" was a brilliant film, worthy of multiple viewings.  The cinematography is breathtaking, and I didn't feel that any of the CGI effects came off as cheesy.However, this film is definately not for everyone.  If you have a problem with wuxia films, then you are definately not going to like this.  To appreciate the genre, one must accept that the characters are endowed with supernatural abilities.  I've spoke to many people who don't like wuxia because they think they're unrealistic.  Curiously, these same people have no problem with ""The Matrix"" and ""Star Wars"", which are equally unrealistic. And if you're just looking for eye candy and cool fight scenes, you may be equally disappointed.  While ""The Promise"" has both eye candy and action in spades, it also contains a very complex plot.  You really have to pay close attention, or you're going to get lost very quickly.  I would reccomend you watch ""Fearless"" instead. That's a film that's not only great, but also quite easy to follow.But if I had to choose between the two, I'd choose this one.  I like films that really push the envelope and strive to succeed on every level. ""The Promise"" delivers.

1029758,A3K1JFYC9KOVV5,B000JVSUXO,CB,"[6, 7]","Having seen ""Hero"" and ""House of the Flying Daggers,"" I expected a great deal out of ""The Promise."" The story combines a number of interesting folk tale-esque elements - a princess who, at an early age, chose to be beautiful but, in return, is cursed at love; a brash and boastful warrior-virtuoso and his servant, who can run faster than the wind; and their opposite numbers, a cruel villain who seeks a secret only the brash warrior's servant can reveal. As the plot unfolds, a love triangle and cases of mistaken identity ensue, leading to a fairly emotional climax. The story, however well-conceived, ultimately falls flat and fails to deliver on its early promise. The film's production design and special effects also leave a great deal to be desired, making the daring-do of the heroes frequently appear laughable. Indeed, for an action film, there are also very few battle scenes to break up the monotony.

1029760,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000JVSUXO,Grady Harp,"[2, 3]","In WU JI (`THE PROMISE') Kaige Chen has attempted to surpass the major Chinese epics of recent years with mixed results: there are moments of stunningly beautiful color and a story that is more human than the grand films by others, but the end product is too tampered with crude computer graphics and cheesy scenes to sustain the belief in fantasy that these films require.The opening scene where Qingcheng (uncredited as a child actress) is confronted by the Goddess Manchen (Hong Chen) in the middle of an aqueous atmosphere and the 'promise' is contracted is as sensuously lovely as anything on film. But from there we plough through a story of fighting between barbarians and royalty, of love affairs between Princess Qingcheng (Cecilia Cheung as the adult version) and the General Guangming (Hiroyuki Sanada) with the addition of love interest from the General's slave Kunlun (Dong-Kun Jang), and of confrontations with mythic figures such as the Snow Wolf (Ye Liu) and the evil Wuhuan (Nicholas Tse), and the stories collide and ultimately get lost in the special effects.Much can be said for the cinematic beauty of this film: equal disappointment can be voiced for the crude computer graphics and tacky mass scenes with weapons that look plastic Tonka toys. In the end it feels as though the director/writer was more interested in the competing ingredients of his colorful soup than in the work as a whole. Another problem with the DVD is the superimposed English dubbing that is completely out of sync with the story AND subtitles that conflict with the language of the film: to see this unfortunate mismanagement of effects, turn on the English dubbing simultaneously with the English subtitles and see how even the numbers being spoken aren't even close to being the same!

1029763,A3BC8YL69NOCUP,B000JVSUXO,jmpg,"[11, 15]","I happened to catch this movie shortly after it was released in China, meaning this review is on the original uncut theatrical version. I'll tell you right now, it doesn't matter which version you're watching because it is still nonsense either way. Especially if you're from China, you probably already know how incredibly bad this movie was received. This is supposed to be a fantasy, and you're not really supposed to question what happens in fantasies. But many of the things in this movie were so illogical and unbelievable it makes me wonder if Chen Kaige even watched it himself. It seems like he was so excited with all the ideas he came up with that he had no idea how to organize anything. This movie was a critical failure and a national joke in China, and it's easy to see why.Read any summary of The Promise and you'll most likely come across something along the lines of this: a cursed princess who's the center of attraction of three different men and the fates that await them. Sounds engaging, right? Unfortunately, the movie hardly ever explores this idea any further than what I've just said. It plods along through a series of flying colors, generic action sequences, ridiculously awful dialogue (especially if you know Mandarin), overdone yet bland special effects, and a story almost completely devoid of logic and all things reasonable. The fact this movie in its current form is the final product is absolutely unbelievable. Asian directors nowadays think they can just thrust famous actors into a colorful world and expect Hollywood to be impressed.I won't give away spoilers, but the story itself is too disjointed to say anything and virtually every scene is so sensationalized that you could care less what is happening to the people in them. In fact, the cast are not even people to really care about, but rather just an assembly of characters and nothing more. There is no meaningful connection to them because the movie never makes up its mind what it wants to talk about. New situations arise, expect you to be concerned, only to end up undeveloped or forgotten. Scenes make no sense in relation to the ones that preceded them and so forth. It's difficult to provide examples without explaining exact details from the movie, but a lot of the characters' actions were just so utterly mind-boggling, flip-flopping feelings and emotions were unconvincingly bad and laughable.A lot of people raved at how ""beautiful"" the movie was, even though a majority of it looked like it was done on someone's home computer. There are video games, television shows and commercials that produced far better results than this. When nobody was trying to kill each other with plastic toys as weapons, they were being modeled in blatantly horrendous CGI fakery. The musical score was far too bombastic for its own good in an attempt to somehow generate a response from viewers but was totally out of place. Some scenes were displayed only to show off special effects or action (like what was that giant circular cage doing in the middle of nowhere?). Also, the Mandarin spoken in this movie was absolutely dreadful. This is what happens when you take any of Asia's hottest stars, dress them up in costumes and try to pass it off as a new movie.I can't believe how much money was spent on this garbage, and it's hard to believe the number of people who gave this their approval. Apparently, you're supposed to let yourself go because it's a fairy tale. Sorry, but even fairy tales are supposed to make sense. In this movie, Chen Kaige made the characters do things that would have made little sense in anyone's culture or language.

1029766,A1IWWRZJOXOSYP,B000JVSUXO,Lee Armstrong,"[3, 4]","Chen Kaige acted in ""The Last Emperor"" and directed ""Farewell, My Concubine"" that was nominated for the Best Foreign Language Film in 1993.  My understanding is that this film made a lot of money in China; but for me it translates less well into our Western mindset.  I enjoyed the fantasy part with the goddess giving Quingcheng a magic pact that she would be wealthy, but not have true love.  Cecilia Cheung won Best Actress from the Hong Kong Film Awards for this film.  She does a credible job as the woman who wants the one thing she cannot have, love.  I saw Jang Dong-gun in the Korean film ""The Coast Guard.""  As the slave Kunlun, he has giant puppy dog eyes for the lovely Quingcheng.  His ability to run at the speed of lightning that comes from his childhood citizenship in the Land of Snow reminded me of watching an old Road Runner cartoon.  After the death of his master, he agrees to be the slave of General Guangming.  Hiroyuki Sanada who plays the general was in ""The Last Samurai"" that starred Tom Cruise.  I couldn't quite guess what the attraction was that drew Quingcheng to him, but he fills the bravado of the character with excellence.  I saw Nicholas Tse in a DVD that may no longer be available called ""Gen X-Cops.""  While that wasn't the best of films, as the evil nemesis Wuhuan, he does a great job.  Costumes and scene design are excellent and give the film an amazing look.  Hollywood has been slow to adopt the emphasis on the visual that is now frequently seen in Asian cinema.  The Golden Globes nominated this film as Best Foreign Language Film in 2005.  For me, it didn't play quite as well.  It was certainly an epic journey filled with action and romance, but by the end of the film I wasn't all that connected to the characters.  I think I most enjoyed Nicholas Tse's nefarious Wuhuan; so you know a film didn't work when you're rooting for the bad guy.  It is still worth seeing given that expectations are not too high.

I decided to go into it with an open mind since there seems to be a lot of people that don't like movies like 'House of Flying Daggers' and even 'Fearless' if you can believe that!.  Well unlike those masterpieces, director Chen Kaige will let you know right away not to take the movie seriously.The story is about a slave who can literally run faster than the wind becomes a great General's slave and when the General is injured he gives his slave his famed Crimson Armor so that he can greet the king in his place.  Now I wish I could go over every way that this movie fails but I will just gve a couple examples from the beginning.  How the general could think that a slave could visit the King and actually fool him is beyond me.  Then when he does show up to see the King, the villian is busy killing the King.  Then the slave shows up, kills the King, saves a girl, and is off.  So of course the General is in big trouble.  Now the chemistry between all of the characters was fine but the script and the directing job are just horrible.  I didn't feel any emotions AT ALL.

Like the fantasy tales of `Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' `Hero' and `House of the Flying Daggers,' you can say the film belongs to the film genre usually called `wusha,' but what is impressive about 'Wu Ji' (or `The Promise' with international title) is its cast and crew gathered for the production. But about that, later.[STORY: LITTLE GIRL] The film opens with a memorable shot, in which an orphaned girl wanders among the dead bodies of warriors in the battlefield. The starving girl meets a beautiful but haughty deity Manshen, the Sorceress (Chen Hong, also co-producer and Chen Kaige's wife), who promises the little girl Quingcheng everything - easy life, status, etc. - on one condition. That is, Quingcheng can never get true love from anyone. And the goddess says: `Once you have accepted your destiny, nothing can alter it unless rivers flow uphill, time runs backwards, and the dead come back to life.' She accepts it, not knowing what the pact really means.[GENERAL AND SLAVE] Years later, the film introduces us to another battlefied, a ravine where Guanming, The Mighty General (Hiroyuki Sanada `The Last Samurai') is waiting for the next battle. The army of the General is outnumbered by the enemy soldiers, but the General, overconfident and very arrogant, is saved by the miraculous work by one slave Kunlun (Jang Dong-Gun, 'The Brotherhood of War'). Greatly impressed by the superhuman power of Kunlun (who can ""run"" with lightning speed even on four limb), the General takes Kunlun under his wing, and continues his battles.The plot thickens when grown-up Quingcheng, now the Princess (Cecilia Cheung), is kidnapped by Kunlun who disguises himself wearing the armor of the General. While Kunlun is enchanted by the beauty of the Princess/Quingcheng, she is also in love with this brave man in gorgeous armor, thinking that he is the General, not the slave.[TWO MEMORABLE SUPPORTS] The three principal players Hiroyuki Sanada, Jang Dong-Gun and Cecilia Cheung are all good, but probably Nicholas Tse as ruthless Wuhuan and Liu Yeh as assassin Snow Wolf will linger in your memory much longer  with their long fight sequence (with clever use flying fans). Nicholas Tse succeeds in making the role of the `villain' surprisingly three-dimensional, and Liu Yeh gives a credible portrait as a killer, or a doomed man who must accept the fact he cannot escape from the inevitable fate.As is seen in `House of the Flying Daggers' the story of `Wu Ji' is generally melodramatic, but that didn't bother me. What is regrettable is that for all the good acting from these actors, the director fails to explore the romantic side of the story. The film's pace is often too slow, sometimes digressing into a sub-plot, and the film's tone is sometimes ineptly chosen. (With not-so-great CGI, some part of the film looks unintentionally comical).[WELL, THE SPECIAL EFFECTS ARE ... er ... UNIQUE] What should I say? I am trying not to use the standard of Hollywood (which is not perfect, you know), but even so, the effects of `Wu Ji' look awfully misguided, or at least far from sophisticated. `Bad' is not the right word, for several effects are actually beautifully done. Still, in this epic fantasy, handsome and talented Jang Dong-Gun must run madly on four limbs, among the stampede of the wild bulls ... and he wins the race! Cecilia Cheung's Princess is literally kept in a cage (and herself in a while bird-like costume), and she actually `flies.' There is nothing subtle about Chen Kaige's use of CGI, and some of them may make the audiences giggle at the most serious moment.The fantastic photography is by Peter Pau (`Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon') and the beautiful costume by Kimiya Masago and Tin Yip. Well, I don't know why Chen Kaige insisted on the use of these special effects when he can liberally use their excellent works. The music is by Klaus Badelt (`Time Machine' and others).It is reported that `Wu Ji' is the most expensive film ever made in China, and looking at the picture, you can easily see where all these money went. It is regrettable that more refined storytelling and more restrained CGI images would be much effective and desirable in this epic romance film.",3,"Chen Kaige's Martial Arts Fantasy Tale: Beautiful, But Uneven and Often Looks Silly",1146700800,"05 4, 2006",2006,4419,"['[', 'following', 'review', 'refers', '124', 'minute', 'version', 'released', 'Feb', '2006', 'Japan', ']', 'Wu', 'Ji', 'meaning', 'Limitation', 'epic-scale', 'romance', 'directed', 'renowned', 'Chen', 'Kaige', 'Farewell', 'My', 'Concubine', ""'Together"", 'fantasy', 'tales', 'Crouching', 'Tiger', 'Hidden', 'Dragon', 'Hero', 'House', 'Flying', 'Daggers', 'can', 'say', 'film', 'belongs', 'film', 'genre', 'usually', 'called', 'wusha', 'what', 'impressive', 'Ji', 'Promise', 'international', 'title', 'cast', 'crew', 'gathered', 'production', 'later', '[', 'STORY', 'LITTLE', 'GIRL', ']', 'film', 'memorable', 'shot', 'orphaned', 'girl', 'wanders', 'dead', 'bodies', 'warriors', 'battlefield', 'starving', 'girl', 'meets', 'beautiful', 'haughty', 'deity', 'Manshen', 'Sorceress', 'Chen', 'Hong', 'also', 'co-producer', 'Chen', 'Kaige', 'wife', 'who', 'little', 'girl', 'Quingcheng', 'everything', 'easy', 'life', 'status', 'etc', 'one', 'condition', 'Quingcheng', 'can', 'never', 'get', 'true', 'love', 'anyone', 'goddess', 'Once', 'have', 'accepted', 'destiny', 'nothing', 'can', 'alter', 'rivers', 'flow', 'uphill', 'time', 'runs', 'backwards', 'dead', 'come', 'back', 'life', 'not', 'knowing', 'what', 'pact', 'really', '[', 'GENERAL', 'AND', 'SLAVE', ']', 'Years', 'later', 'film', 'battlefied', 'ravine', 'where', 'Guanming', 'Mighty', 'General', 'Hiroyuki', 'Sanada', 'Last', 'Samurai', 'waiting', 'next', 'battle', 'army', 'General', 'outnumbered', 'enemy', 'soldiers', 'General', 'overconfident', 'very', 'arrogant', 'saved', 'miraculous', 'work', 'one', 'slave', 'Kunlun', 'Jang', 'Dong-Gun', ""'The"", 'Brotherhood', 'War', 'Greatly', 'impressed', 'superhuman', 'power', 'Kunlun', 'who', 'can', 'run', 'lightning', 'speed', 'even', 'four', 'limb', 'General', 'Kunlun', 'wing', 'battles.The', 'plot', 'thickens', 'when', 'grown-up', 'Quingcheng', 'now', 'Princess', 'Cecilia', 'Cheung', 'kidnapped', 'Kunlun', 'who', 'wearing', 'armor', 'General', 'Kunlun', 'enchanted', 'beauty', 'Princess/Quingcheng', 'also', 'love', 'brave', 'man', 'gorgeous', 'armor', 'thinking', 'General', 'not', 'slave', 'TWO', 'MEMORABLE', 'SUPPORTS', ']', 'three', 'principal', 'players', 'Hiroyuki', 'Sanada', 'Jang', 'Dong-Gun', 'Cecilia', 'Cheung', 'are', 'good', 'probably', 'Nicholas', 'Tse', 'ruthless', 'Wuhuan', 'Liu', 'Yeh', 'assassin', 'Snow', 'Wolf', 'will', 'linger', 'memory', 'much', 'longer', 'long', 'fight', 'sequence', 'clever', 'use', 'flying', 'fans', 'Tse', 'making', 'role', 'villain', 'surprisingly', 'three-dimensional', 'Liu', 'Yeh', 'credible', 'portrait', 'killer', 'doomed', 'man', 'who', 'must', 'accept', 'fact', 'can', 'not', 'escape', 'inevitable', 'fate.As', 'seen', 'House', 'Flying', 'Daggers', 'story', 'Wu', 'Ji', 'generally', 'melodramatic', 'did', ""n't"", 'bother', 'What', 'regrettable', 'good', 'acting', 'actors', 'director', 'explore', 'romantic', 'side', 'story', 'film', 'pace', 'often', 'too', 'slow', 'sometimes', 'digressing', 'sub-plot', 'film', 'tone', 'sometimes', 'ineptly', 'chosen', 'not-so-great', 'CGI', 'part', 'film', 'unintentionally', 'comical', '[', 'WELL', 'THE', 'SPECIAL', 'EFFECTS', 'ARE', 'er', 'UNIQUE', ']', 'What', 'should', 'say', 'am', 'trying', 'not', 'use', 'standard', 'Hollywood', 'not', 'perfect', 'know', 'even', 'so', 'effects', 'Wu', 'Ji', 'look', 'awfully', 'misguided', 'least', 'far', 'sophisticated', 'Bad', 'not', 'right', 'word', 'several', 'effects', 'are', 'actually', 'beautifully', 'done', 'Still', 'epic', 'fantasy', 'handsome', 'talented', 'Jang', 'Dong-Gun', 'must', 'run', 'madly', 'four', 'limbs', 'stampede', 'wild', 'bulls', 'race', 'Cecilia', 'Cheung', 'Princess', 'literally', 'kept', 'cage', 'while', 'bird-like', 'costume', 'actually', 'flies', 'nothing', 'subtle', 'Chen', 'Kaige', 'use', 'CGI', 'may', 'make', 'audiences', 'giggle', 'most', 'serious', 'moment.The', 'fantastic', 'photography', 'Peter', 'Pau', 'Crouching', 'Tiger', 'Hidden', 'Dragon', 'beautiful', 'costume', 'Kimiya', 'Masago', 'Tin', 'Yip', 'Well', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'Chen', 'Kaige', 'insisted', 'use', 'special', 'effects', 'when', 'can', 'liberally', 'use', 'excellent', 'works', 'music', 'Klaus', 'Badelt', 'Time', 'Machine', 'others', '.It', 'reported', 'Wu', 'Ji', 'most', 'expensive', 'film', 'ever', 'made', 'China', 'looking', 'picture', 'can', 'easily', 'see', 'where', 'money', 'went', 'regrettable', 'more', 'refined', 'storytelling', 'more', 'restrained', 'CGI', 'images', 'would', 'be', 'much', 'effective', 'desirable', 'epic', 'romance', 'film']",The Promise

I agree, some of the CGI is not up to snuff, but it's a visually gorgeous film nonetheless: opulent, vibrant, and vivid. If this was made with a good deal less money than Yimou's films, then we have more reason to praise it, not less. The story is engaging and interesting from start to finish, with plenty of surprises along the way. The film begins with an almost campy comedic tone and ends with high-styled Shakespearian pathos.

1029780,A1SPB225CVTRUU,B000JVSUXO,"Wing Lee ""filmfan""","[4, 9]","Chen Kaige is one of the greatest directors in China and his film Farewell My Concubine(Gong Li, Leslie Cheung). That was a decade ago at least when he had a different approach and style. With the current trend and demand for lavish period kungfu movies, it was inevitable that even Chen would want to have a blockbuster like Hero and Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. He does have the budget to make The Promise to be that kind of film, and the final product looks obsolutely stunning in an artistic aspect.The film stars an all-star international cast including HK's ""It Girl"" Cecilia as the love interest of the emperor, Nicolas Tsai as the rebellious prince, Korea's Jang Dong Jun as the super-fast runner, and the director's wife plays a powerful Goddess. The story is a combination of fair tale and romantic war movie set in ancient China. The individual fight scenes were pretty good, but the huge army battles looked very cartoonish because the CGI's were not realistic.What's very impressive is the production design, wardrobe, and even music score. The actors weren't very well directed and their performances seemed unconvincing and emotionally unaffecting. Nothing like Leslie Cheung and Gong Li's memorable performances. There was an unintentional funny scene when Cecilia was about to be attack by hundreds of soldiers. She was standing on the roof and proceeded to use her beauty and sex appeal to discourage them from killing her. It really looked comical and hideous, because she thought every men on earth would find her attractive and irresistable. I find that she's either too young or too modern looking to play such period beauty, and she just didn't have the kind of look and impact made by Joey Wong in A Chinese Ghost Story (1,2,3).",3,"Visually Sumptuous, but lack emotional connection.",1169856000,"01 27, 2007",2007,1755,"['Chen', 'Kaige', 'one', 'greatest', 'directors', 'China', 'film', 'Farewell', 'My', 'Concubine', 'Gong', 'Li', 'Leslie', 'Cheung', 'was', 'decade', 'ago', 'least', 'when', 'had', 'different', 'approach', 'style', 'current', 'trend', 'demand', 'lavish', 'period', 'kungfu', 'movies', 'was', 'inevitable', 'even', 'Chen', 'would', 'want', 'have', 'blockbuster', 'Hero', 'Crouching', 'Tiger', 'Hidden', 'Dragon', 'have', 'budget', 'make', 'Promise', 'be', 'kind', 'film', 'final', 'product', 'obsolutely', 'stunning', 'artistic', 'aspect.The', 'film', 'all-star', 'international', 'cast', 'including', 'HK', 'Girl', 'Cecilia', 'love', 'interest', 'emperor', 'Nicolas', 'Tsai', 'rebellious', 'prince', 'Korea', 'Jang', 'Dong', 'Jun', 'super-fast', 'runner', 'director', 'wife', 'powerful', 'Goddess', 'story', 'combination', 'fair', 'tale', 'romantic', 'war', 'movie', 'set', 'ancient', 'China', 'individual', 'fight', 'scenes', 'were', 'pretty', 'good', 'huge', 'army', 'battles', 'looked', 'very', 'cartoonish', 'CGI', 'were', 'not', 'realistic.What', 'very', 'impressive', 'production', 'design', 'wardrobe', 'even', 'music', 'score', 'actors', 'were', ""n't"", 'very', 'well', 'directed', 'performances', 'seemed', 'unconvincing', 'emotionally', 'unaffecting', 'Nothing', 'Leslie', 'Cheung', 'Gong', 'Li', 'memorable', 'performances', 'was', 'unintentional', 'funny', 'scene', 'when', 'Cecilia', 'was', 'be', 'attack', 'hundreds', 'soldiers', 'was', 'standing', 'roof', 'proceeded', 'use', 'beauty', 'sex', 'appeal', 'discourage', 'killing', 'really', 'looked', 'comical', 'hideous', 'thought', 'men', 'earth', 'would', 'find', 'attractive', 'irresistable', 'find', 'too', 'young', 'too', 'modern', 'looking', 'play', 'such', 'period', 'beauty', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'kind', 'look', 'impact', 'made', 'Joey', 'Wong', 'A', 'Chinese', 'Ghost', 'Story', '1,2,3']",The Promise

I will not go into the story description as it has been covered. It is full of the virtues that I like so much in Asian films. Honor, sacrafice, and death.The DVD I watched was the shorter version. It includes the deleted scenes which I watched and do not feel they added or subtracted a whole lot from the story. The fact that the Asian release included them makes me wonder why they were cut out. The bothersome issue with this DVD is the film defaults to the awful english over dubs. You have to manually go into the menu and choose Chinese (Mandarin), and then designate english sub titles.I love Crouching Tiger, Hero and House of Flying Daggers. This movie is none of those. While it has some beautiful moments it does seem 'synthethic'. If it were the directors intent to create an abstract feel he suceeded.The CGI is deplorable. I have no problem with the fantasy aspect but this looked almost animated. Maybe Lord of the Rings ruined it for all but if this was supposed to be the most expensive movie ever made in China they could have done better. An example: the over view of the palace is a model. Absolutely obvious. The flying fights made so famous on other films of the genre are not at all fluid here, but jerky and clumsy.All in all I watched with intrest. I had no desire to turn it off.
