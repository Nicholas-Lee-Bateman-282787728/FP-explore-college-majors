Burrese ""Author, Speaker, Mediator, ...","[6, 6]","My first impression while watching ""2012 Prophecy: Change, Apocalypse and The End Of The World"" a film by Shaahin Cheyene for Victory Films, Inc.,  was how beautifully it was filmed.  There are many striking scenes of beauty throughout the film.  My second impression was that this film had much thought put into it, and it has achieve a goal of presenting a documentary about 2012 that cuts through the hype and provides some interesting and enlightening interviews that explain a culture that many know nothing about, and this includes an interview with renowned Aztec Medicine Man Miktlan Ehekateotl Kuahtlinxan, who identifies himself as a ""Keeper of the Tradition.""  And he is not preaching the end of the world, in fact, his message is just the opposite.  I wish everyone would listen to the message of this wise man, especially when he says ""respect everything.""  Because I believe what he says is true, when you respect everything, you will be respected too.This is not a doom and gloom film, but an enlightening film filled with positivity and hope.  There is a message of doing good and loving more.  It's a journey toward the ancient, to find solutions for the present, which includes a message of kindness.  I saw similarities with the ancient Asian cultures that I have studied, and it reinforced my belief that there is so much to learn from the past, if we would only listen.I don't care if you are a die hard believer that the world will end in 2012, or if you think all the hype is crazy lunacy, this film is worth watching.  (Although if you do believe the world will end, this film may illustrate why it won't.)  There is a good message about life here, and I hope the 2012 title doesn't keep people from watching.This film is a bit different from the kinds of books and DVDs that I normally review.  But when  Shaahin Cheyene asked me if I'd provide some feedback on his new film, I thought it sounded interesting.  I am very glad I was introduced to this project, because for forty-nine minutes, I was engrossed in a beautifully filmed project with an uplifting message.  Considering what many people, myself included, spend time watching, this short less than one hour film is definitely worth watching, and maybe even more than once.  I truly hope people watch, learn, and act upon the messages found within Cheyene's great documentary film.Reviewed by Alain Burrese, J.D., author of the upcoming Tough Guy Wisdom series.",5,"Not Doom and Gloom, But An Enlightening Film Filled With Positivity and Hope",1305936000,"05 21, 2011",2011,2444,"['first', 'impression', 'watching', '2012', 'Prophecy', 'Change', 'Apocalypse', 'End', 'World', 'film', 'Shaahin', 'Cheyene', 'Victory', 'Films', 'Inc.', 'was', 'how', 'beautifully', 'was', 'filmed', 'are', 'many', 'striking', 'scenes', 'beauty', 'film', 'second', 'impression', 'was', 'film', 'had', 'much', 'thought', 'put', 'achieve', 'goal', 'presenting', 'documentary', '2012', 'hype', 'interesting', 'enlightening', 'interviews', 'explain', 'culture', 'many', 'know', 'nothing', 'interview', 'renowned', 'Aztec', 'Medicine', 'Man', 'Miktlan', 'Ehekateotl', 'Kuahtlinxan', 'who', 'Keeper', 'Tradition', 'not', 'preaching', 'end', 'world', 'fact', 'message', 'just', 'opposite', 'wish', 'everyone', 'would', 'listen', 'message', 'wise', 'man', 'especially', 'when', 'respect', 'everything', 'believe', 'what', 'true', 'when', 'respect', 'everything', 'will', 'be', 'respected', 'too.This', 'not', 'doom', 'gloom', 'film', 'enlightening', 'film', 'filled', 'positivity', 'hope', 'message', 'doing', 'good', 'loving', 'more', 'journey', 'ancient', 'find', 'solutions', 'present', 'message', 'kindness', 'saw', 'similarities', 'ancient', 'Asian', 'cultures', 'have', 'studied', 'reinforced', 'belief', 'so', 'much', 'learn', 'past', 'would', 'only', 'listen.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'are', 'die', 'hard', 'believer', 'world', 'will', 'end', '2012', 'think', 'hype', 'crazy', 'lunacy', 'film', 'worth', 'watching', 'do', 'believe', 'world', 'will', 'end', 'film', 'may', 'illustrate', 'why', 'wo', ""n't"", 'good', 'message', 'life', 'here', 'hope', '2012', 'title', ""n't"", 'keep', 'people', 'watching.This', 'film', 'bit', 'different', 'kinds', 'books', 'DVDs', 'normally', 'review', 'when', 'Shaahin', 'Cheyene', 'asked', ""'d"", 'provide', 'feedback', 'new', 'film', 'thought', 'sounded', 'interesting', 'am', 'very', 'glad', 'was', 'introduced', 'project', 'forty-nine', 'minutes', 'was', 'engrossed', 'beautifully', 'filmed', 'project', 'uplifting', 'message', 'Considering', 'what', 'many', 'people', 'included', 'spend', 'time', 'watching', 'short', 'less', 'one', 'hour', 'film', 'definitely', 'worth', 'watching', 'maybe', 'even', 'more', 'once', 'truly', 'hope', 'people', 'watch', 'learn', 'act', 'messages', 'found', 'Cheyene', 'great', 'documentary', 'film.Reviewed', 'Alain', 'Burrese', 'J.D.', 'author', 'upcoming', 'Tough', 'Guy', 'Wisdom', 'series']","2012 Prophecy Change,Apocalypse And The End Of The World -SALE! $9.99"
1425938,A141HP4LYPWMSR,B004QP8B6K,Brian E. Erland,"[0, 2]","Is the world on the brink of destruction? Does the Mayan calendar indicate that the life will come to an end on 12/21/12? Are we living in the end times and is Biblical prophecy being fulfilled before our very eyes? Are we hovering on the brink of Armageddon? Whether you're a believer in any of the doomsday scenarios being bantered about or not one thing is certain, there is an ever increasing amount of uncertainty and fear being generated unlike anything I've previously experienced in my lifetime. As negativity multiples at quantum speed accompanied by social unrest, political upheaval and natural disasters some type of change or transformation appears to be on the not too distant horizon. The only question is exactly what is it that lies ahead?Shaahin Cheyene's new documentary film `2012 Prophecy Change, Apocalypse And The End Of The World' approaches the 2012 angst from a positive perspective through the lens of a rather unique spiritual tradition. The spiritual tradition is that of the Aztec and its spokesperson is Miktlan Ehekateotl Kuauhtlinxan, a self described shaman or medicine man. Miktlan shares in the narration along with Shaahin Cheyene who also happens to be the writer, producer, and director of this film. Both will share what 12/21/12 may portend for the future and our continued existence on planet Earth. To survive we must change and that change is holistic in nature involving not only what we do and how we live, but how we think and who we are as well.We are told that modern society has gone astray from the ancient wisdom that now resides primarily in the beliefs and practices of indigenous cultures. While they have lived in harmony with the environment for millennia we have exploited the Earth's resources in ways that cannot continue if we are to continue on. Much of what is presented here isn't new. But then truth is as old as time so simply because we have heard something before doesn't mean we don't need to hear it again. The ultimate message is we must be open to a transformation or we will cease to exist.The presentation is not high tech by any means but I see that as a good thing. A film such as this is about delivering a substantive message, not provide entertaining escapism. There has been much too much of that for far too long. The passionate belief of Miktlan and Shaahin comes across as sincere and heartfelt in my opinion, providing a very personal, intimate atmosphere to the film that I found quite immensely appealing.Whether all the discussion and apprehension over 12/21/21 is legitimate or nothing more than a lot of emotional hype who really knows? We'll just have to wait until then and see what happens. In the meantime the moment to re-evaluate who we are and how we live is always now. I thank Shaahin Cheyene and Miktlan for keeping me thinking and wondering about the meaning of life here in the present moment. Isn't that what it's all about?",5,"""I Bring A Message From The Past"" ~ Crossing The Portal To A New Age",1303603200,"04 24, 2011",2011,2926,"['world', 'brink', 'destruction', 'Mayan', 'calendar', 'indicate', 'life', 'will', 'come', 'end', '12/21/12', 'Are', 'living', 'end', 'times', 'Biblical', 'prophecy', 'being', 'fulfilled', 'very', 'eyes', 'Are', 'hovering', 'brink', 'Armageddon', 'Whether', ""'re"", 'believer', 'doomsday', 'scenarios', 'being', 'bantered', 'not', 'one', 'thing', 'certain', 'ever', 'increasing', 'amount', 'uncertainty', 'fear', 'being', 'generated', 'anything', ""'ve"", 'previously', 'experienced', 'lifetime', 'negativity', 'multiples', 'quantum', 'speed', 'accompanied', 'social', 'unrest', 'political', 'upheaval', 'natural', 'disasters', 'type', 'change', 'transformation', 'be', 'not', 'too', 'distant', 'horizon', 'only', 'question', 'exactly', 'what', 'ahead', 'Shaahin', 'Cheyene', 'new', 'documentary', 'film', '2012', 'Prophecy', 'Change', 'Apocalypse', 'End', 'World', 'approaches', '2012', 'angst', 'positive', 'perspective', 'lens', 'rather', 'unique', 'spiritual', 'tradition', 'spiritual', 'tradition', 'Aztec', 'spokesperson', 'Miktlan', 'Ehekateotl', 'Kuauhtlinxan', 'self', 'described', 'shaman', 'medicine', 'man', 'Miktlan', 'shares', 'narration', 'Shaahin', 'Cheyene', 'who', 'also', 'be', 'writer', 'producer', 'director', 'film', 'will', 'share', 'what', '12/21/12', 'may', 'portend', 'future', 'continued', 'existence', 'planet', 'Earth', 'survive', 'must', 'change', 'change', 'holistic', 'nature', 'involving', 'not', 'only', 'what', 'do', 'how', 'live', 'how', 'think', 'who', 'are', 'well.We', 'are', 'told', 'modern', 'society', 'gone', 'astray', 'ancient', 'wisdom', 'now', 'primarily', 'beliefs', 'practices', 'indigenous', 'cultures', 'have', 'lived', 'harmony', 'environment', 'millennia', 'have', 'exploited', 'Earth', 'resources', 'ways', 'can', 'not', 'continue', 'are', 'continue', 'Much', 'what', 'presented', 'here', ""n't"", 'new', 'then', 'truth', 'as', 'old', 'time', 'so', 'simply', 'have', 'heard', 'something', 'before', ""n't"", 'mean', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'hear', 'again', 'ultimate', 'message', 'must', 'be', 'open', 'transformation', 'will', 'cease', 'exist.The', 'presentation', 'not', 'high', 'tech', 'means', 'see', 'good', 'thing', 'film', 'such', 'delivering', 'substantive', 'message', 'not', 'provide', 'entertaining', 'escapism', 'been', 'much', 'too', 'much', 'far', 'too', 'long', 'passionate', 'belief', 'Miktlan', 'Shaahin', 'sincere', 'heartfelt', 'opinion', 'providing', 'very', 'personal', 'intimate', 'atmosphere', 'film', 'found', 'quite', 'immensely', 'discussion', 'apprehension', '12/21/21', 'legitimate', 'nothing', 'more', 'lot', 'emotional', 'hype', 'who', 'really', ""'ll"", 'just', 'have', 'wait', 'then', 'see', 'what', 'meantime', 'moment', 're-evaluate', 'who', 'are', 'how', 'live', 'always', 'now', 'thank', 'Shaahin', 'Cheyene', 'Miktlan', 'keeping', 'thinking', 'wondering', 'meaning', 'life', 'here', 'present', 'moment', ""n't"", 'what']","2012 Prophecy Change,Apocalypse And The End Of The World -SALE! $9.99"
1425939,A11OTLEDSW8ZXD,B004QP8B6K,CGScammell,"[0, 2]","When I first watched this documentary I was surprised at how much artistry was in this production.  I was expecting to see rough cuts of indigenous peoples from various backgrounds discussing why this 2012 is all nothing more than New Age hype.  The cinematography is beautiful, the fluty soundtrack pleasing to the ear and there are many good quotes from a spiritual point of view.There are many shots of Shaahin Cheyenne talking straight into the camera, other times you hear his soothing voice while a red  loincloth-wearing young man silently twirls a batan in slo motion.  I am not sure what this man is to represent, and there are many posed shots of red-painted people smiling, walking or just staring into the camera.  This was the part I didn't care so much for, but this artistic aspect apparently is a Cheyenne trademark.An English-speaking Aztecan medicine man, Miktlan Ehekateotl Kuahtlinxan, is the first person introduced, and he appears repeatedly throughout this production.  He is one of 11 people  in this short 45-minute documentary to tell the audience that 2012 is not the end of the world, but the beginning of a new one.  No one needs to panic.His words are repeated in different form by the others interviewed.  One professor says there is no indication that 2012 is the end of the world, it's all New-Age hype, because he hasn't come across any such prophecies in Mayan hieroglyphics.  Author  David Pinchbeck says this prediction is based on a Mayan belief that a major astronomical event will take place fomenting great change.  However, toward the end of the interviews the angle seems to lean more toward ""Kindness, Compassion Love"" and ""spiritual goodness"" and other more feel-good statements stressing communication, relationships and understanding the ways of our ancestors.  Some people may be turned off by this.Cheyenne stresses that not one person he spoke to talked about a worldly demise or great destruction for 2012.  He does state, however,  ""... what we anticipate to see in 2012 is a lot of social change, a lot of cultural change,  a lot of economic change.  Those who are there to embrace this change will really be in a position to flourish.  However, those who don't embrace the change that may come in 2012 will unfortunately not survive.""  (14:32) I stress the ""may come"" part here; we have been experiencing global change for several years now.For those wanting a straight-forward, scientific proof that the world will not come to an end, these anticlimactic comments are lost in all the artistry.  I have to admit that despite the beautiful photography and music, I was at first taken back by how much this production comes off as more of a poetic, artistic- spiritual production than  a scientific documentary.  The more I watched it, the more I liked it though as  the real message that Cheyenne is telling us is that we need to listen to our indigenous people, we need to understand their ancient practices and their current culture.  In the end he closes with the conclusion  ""Why do they want people to be scared?  Because when people are scared, they are more easily manipulated.""So, in conclusion, yes, this is a very good production but I hesitate to call this a documentary.  If you are looking for dramatic, scientific proof that the world is not coming to an end in 2012, look elsewhere.  If, however, you are looking for deeper meaning to why there is such hype about 2012, this is very well done and will make you reflect on contemporary society.",4,An artistic-spiritual presentation,1303344000,"04 21, 2011",2011,3511,"['When', 'first', 'watched', 'documentary', 'was', 'surprised', 'how', 'much', 'artistry', 'was', 'production', 'was', 'expecting', 'see', 'rough', 'cuts', 'indigenous', 'peoples', 'various', 'backgrounds', 'discussing', 'why', '2012', 'nothing', 'more', 'New', 'Age', 'hype', 'cinematography', 'beautiful', 'fluty', 'soundtrack', 'pleasing', 'ear', 'are', 'many', 'good', 'quotes', 'spiritual', 'point', 'view.There', 'are', 'many', 'shots', 'Shaahin', 'Cheyenne', 'talking', 'straight', 'camera', 'other', 'times', 'hear', 'soothing', 'voice', 'red', 'loincloth-wearing', 'young', 'man', 'silently', 'batan', 'slo', 'motion', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'man', 'represent', 'are', 'many', 'posed', 'shots', 'red-painted', 'people', 'smiling', 'walking', 'just', 'staring', 'camera', 'was', 'part', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'so', 'much', 'artistic', 'aspect', 'apparently', 'Cheyenne', 'trademark.An', 'English-speaking', 'Aztecan', 'medicine', 'man', 'Miktlan', 'Ehekateotl', 'Kuahtlinxan', 'first', 'person', 'introduced', 'repeatedly', 'production', 'one', '11', 'people', 'short', '45-minute', 'documentary', 'tell', 'audience', '2012', 'not', 'end', 'world', 'beginning', 'new', 'one', 'one', 'panic.His', 'words', 'are', 'repeated', 'different', 'form', 'others', 'interviewed', 'One', 'professor', 'indication', '2012', 'end', 'world', 'New-Age', 'hype', ""n't"", 'come', 'such', 'prophecies', 'Mayan', 'hieroglyphics', 'Author', 'David', 'Pinchbeck', 'prediction', 'based', 'Mayan', 'belief', 'major', 'astronomical', 'event', 'will', 'take', 'place', 'fomenting', 'great', 'change', 'However', 'end', 'interviews', 'angle', 'lean', 'more', 'Kindness', 'Compassion', 'Love', 'spiritual', 'goodness', 'other', 'more', 'feel-good', 'statements', 'stressing', 'communication', 'relationships', 'understanding', 'ways', 'ancestors', 'people', 'may', 'be', 'turned', 'off', 'this.Cheyenne', 'stresses', 'not', 'one', 'person', 'spoke', 'talked', 'worldly', 'demise', 'great', 'destruction', '2012', 'state', 'however', 'what', 'anticipate', 'see', '2012', 'lot', 'social', 'change', 'lot', 'cultural', 'change', 'lot', 'economic', 'change', 'who', 'are', 'there', 'embrace', 'change', 'will', 'really', 'be', 'position', 'flourish', 'However', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'embrace', 'change', 'may', 'come', '2012', 'will', 'unfortunately', 'not', 'survive', '14:32', 'stress', 'may', 'come', 'part', 'here', 'have', 'been', 'experiencing', 'global', 'change', 'several', 'years', 'now.For', 'wanting', 'straight-forward', 'scientific', 'proof', 'world', 'will', 'not', 'come', 'end', 'anticlimactic', 'comments', 'are', 'lost', 'artistry', 'have', 'admit', 'beautiful', 'photography', 'music', 'was', 'first', 'taken', 'back', 'how', 'much', 'production', 'off', 'more', 'poetic', 'artistic-', 'spiritual', 'production', 'scientific', 'documentary', 'more', 'watched', 'more', 'liked', 'real', 'message', 'Cheyenne', 'telling', 'need', 'listen', 'indigenous', 'people', 'need', 'understand', 'ancient', 'practices', 'current', 'culture', 'end', 'conclusion', 'Why', 'do', 'want', 'people', 'be', 'scared', 'when', 'people', 'are', 'scared', 'are', 'more', 'easily', 'manipulated', 'So', 'conclusion', 'yes', 'very', 'good', 'production', 'hesitate', 'call', 'documentary', 'are', 'looking', 'dramatic', 'scientific', 'proof', 'world', 'not', 'coming', 'end', '2012', 'look', 'elsewhere', 'however', 'are', 'looking', 'deeper', 'meaning', 'why', 'such', 'hype', '2012', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'will', 'make', 'reflect', 'contemporary', 'society']","2012 Prophecy Change,Apocalypse And The End Of The World -SALE! $9.99"

Central to this film are comments made by medicine man Miktlan Ehekateotl Kuahtlinxan, who reassures us that the Tetzkatlipoka view 2012 as a beginning, not as an end. Without many specifics regarding exactly what we might expect to see during this long-prophesized turning of a 5,215 year calendar cycle, this film leads the audience to view modern society and ways of life through eyes of ancient indigenous wisdom.I love the way 2012 Prophecy points out the importance of love and compassion and kindness as the way forward. 2012 Prophecy includes wonderful footage of modern day Aztecs living in modern times, while retaining the core values central to humanity that humans appreciate most in all cultures around the world.

Buxman ""A Seeker of Truth""","[3, 7]","I'm generally a pretty conservative guy and I don't necessarily go for a lot of New Age hype, so when I read some of the other reviews, I was prepared to be underwhelmed.  In viewing this film with an open mind, however, I was pleasantly surprised at both the message and the presentation.  To me, the central theme of this film was the need to divorce ourselves from the fear and hyperbole associated with 2012 and examine our world in terms of what our times are likely to produce and how we can respond and adapt to the changes that are coming.  This is a film about the need for personal transformation at a time when the foundations of our current world order are being shaken.  From an objective standpoint, I honestly haven't seen any solid scientfic evidence that 2012 is going to usher in a global catastrophe.  Having said this, I think anyone who is in tune with current political, social and economic events can see that we are on the cusp of significant changes.  I appreciated the exploration of the Aztec and Mayan historical perspectives about the times we live in and I found the film-maker's message to be a positive one.  I also thought the editing and production values were excellent.If you are looking at the next several months from a position of fear, I think you will benefit from this film.

I was given a secret password via email that allowed me to view this movie for free and to write a good top review for it. Only top reviewers like me were allowed to view and then review this movie for absolutely free, a $19.99 value. But, wait, there's more.Here is what I saw. There is this guy who is almost naked so you keep your kids away and he looks like the father of the dancers in Lady Gaga's Alejandro video. He looks agitated from time to time but at other times he interacts with children and with the environment. All the time they play this strange music that I believe it's called 'trance music' and they show other people wearing props.The idea is that the Mayans or the Aztecs predicted that something major is about to take place but it's going to be okay so maybe world hunger or world peace or something that is a two-word thing where the first word is always 'world' is going to be addressed properly and it's not world's end.

Towards the beginning I recall a part where there was nothing but music and a mix of images and scenes that, although in keeping with the Aztec theme, didn't really add to the main subject of 2012.Another scene that could have been left out was where the medicine man makes a statement along the lines of ""before the Europeans came, Mexico had the cleanest air in the world"". I'm sure if you talked to some Pacific islanders from way back when they'd probably tell you the exact same thing.As mentioned before, one of the primary sources for this video is an Aztec medicine man, but I would have liked to hear more about why they chose that particular one. Was it because he was the only one they could find who could speak English? The medicine man himself stated that there are others like him scattered throughout. If so, why not interview more than just one? It's like using a GPS. If you only have 1 satellite, you aren't going to be very accurate, if you use 3, that's a little better. Use 5 and your GPS is much more likely to reflect where you actually are. Interviewing a couple more medicine men would have made this documentary far more convincing.I personally have never had much interest or fear about the whole 2012 thing, but for those that are still on the fence or lack any sort of opinion on the matter, I still recommend this short film as I'm convinced it does comes across as more clear-headed than many of the other voices on this subject.",3,PUTTING THE HUSH ON HYPE,1303257600,"04 20, 2011",2011,1935,"['go', 'bookstore', ""'re"", 'likely', 'see', 'lots', 'books', '2012', 'New', 'Age/Occult/Spiritual', 'section.Of', 'course', 'easy', 'see', 'why', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'books', 'topic', '2012', 'being', 'only', 'year', 'away.With', 'documentary', 'interviewing', 'actual', 'Aztec', 'medicine', 'man', 'other', 'scholars', 'revealed', '2012', 'more', 'do', 'natural', 'change', 'utter', 'chaos.Although', 'film', 'only', 'about', '50', 'minutes', 'long', 'felt', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'even', 'shorter', 'beginning', 'recall', 'part', 'where', 'was', 'nothing', 'music', 'mix', 'images', 'scenes', 'keeping', 'Aztec', 'theme', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'add', 'main', 'subject', '2012.Another', 'scene', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'left', 'out', 'was', 'where', 'medicine', 'man', 'statement', 'lines', 'Europeans', 'came', 'Mexico', 'had', 'cleanest', 'air', 'world', ""'m"", 'sure', 'talked', 'Pacific', 'islanders', 'way', 'back', 'when', ""'d"", 'probably', 'tell', 'exact', 'same', 'thing.As', 'mentioned', 'one', 'primary', 'sources', 'video', 'Aztec', 'medicine', 'man', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'hear', 'more', 'why', 'chose', 'particular', 'one', 'Was', 'was', 'only', 'one', 'could', 'find', 'who', 'could', 'speak', 'English', 'medicine', 'man', 'stated', 'are', 'others', 'scattered', 'so', 'why', 'not', 'interview', 'more', 'just', 'one', 'using', 'GPS', 'only', 'have', '1', 'satellite', 'are', ""n't"", 'going', 'be', 'very', 'accurate', 'use', '3', 'little', 'better', 'Use', '5', 'GPS', 'much', 'more', 'likely', 'reflect', 'where', 'actually', 'are', 'Interviewing', 'couple', 'more', 'medicine', 'men', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'documentary', 'far', 'more', 'convincing.I', 'personally', 'have', 'never', 'had', 'much', 'interest', 'fear', 'whole', '2012', 'thing', 'are', 'still', 'fence', 'lack', 'sort', 'opinion', 'matter', 'still', 'recommend', 'short', 'film', ""'m"", 'convinced', 'more', 'clear-headed', 'many', 'other', 'voices', 'subject']","2012 Prophecy Change,Apocalypse And The End Of The World -SALE! $9.99"
1425944,A328S9RN3U5M68,B004QP8B6K,Grady Harp,"[1, 4]","Shaahin Cheyene has written, produced and directed this reassuring and illuminating film that is a very quiet and simple manner shares the wisdom of the Mayans, the Aztecs and all indigenous peoples about the secret of the year 2012. In this beautifully photographed homage to humanity he has gathered several great minds, including renowned Aztec medicine man Ehekateotl, to offer a different connotation to the year and the day the world at large feels is the apocalypse.  What this sublimely spiritual film shares is the secret of the Mayan calendar date not as a time to fear  but instead as a time for change.  2012 is the end of a cycle, a cycle that has been poisoned with greed, the 'hunter' mentality, conquest, economic evils, and disturbing of the ecological balance.The Mayans  or Aztecs view humanity as a single organism and as such foster kindness, compassion, and love - caring for each other, providing food and shelter in the most basic manner in harmony with the universe.  Instead of the date in December of 2012 as a time of apocalypse, the indigenous peoples see it as a cycle of darkness - darkness not as a fearful concept but as a time to shed the trappings of destruction imposed on the planet by the civilization now existing and a time for change.  Those who can accept change will survive and return to our roots celebrating the beautiful darkness that accompanies our entry and our exit form this life cycle and those who cannot accept change will perish.Through a series of interviews not only with Ehekateotl but with others as well - including Shaahin Cheyene - coupled with images of nature, of indigenous peoples dancing and healing with holistic methods and inspiring ceremonies, birds in flights, plants and skies, the film gently encourages the viewer to stop dreading 2012 as the end of the world and instead to anticipate CHANGE into a world in harmony, both by finding the harmony within ourselves and by extending that harmony to every living thing.  'Surrender what we are to what we can become.' This is a film that would appeal to everyone and one that should be purchased and then shared with family and friends, preparing for this new cycle.

This film, which is eye-opening, thought-provoking, and made with striking and interesting images, offers the teachings of the ancient Aztecs and Mayans on the doom of civilization through a ""keeper of the ancient tradition,"" an Aztec Medicine Man. The Medicine Man agrees that December 21, 2012 is a significant date, but not because it is the day the world will end. His people, he explains, understood that the world develops in cycles. December 21, 2012 is the end of one cycle and the beginning of another. It is a time of change, a time of opportunity for improving one's self and the world, if only people would accept the science of his people.The Aztecs and Mayans, he states, foresaw that Europeans would invade their land, destroy their culture and their harmony with nature, and obliterate their civilization and environment. Mexico, which was once a verdant paradise, has been polluted. Mexico City today, he says, is the most polluted city in the world. Having foreseen the upheaval, the ancients made sure that certain wise men would go underground, and pass on and retain their culture. Now after 468 years, the Medicine Man has disclosed who he is and wants to share his people's science. People need to realize, he says, that 2012 is a time of change in physical, human, and social conditions. Those who understand this and who can change will prosper and grow. Those who cannot adjust will suffer. People must respect everything on earth for everything on earth is part of a single organism; harm done to one part, hurts everything else. People must learn more about themselves and the earth, develop themselves, and use the earth properly. They must rid themselves of fear, a cancer in today's societies, for the person who fears can be easily manipulated. The primary lesson is love, love for everything; for the one who loves the most is the one who wins.",5,"An interesting and somewhat unique view about 2012 being the ""end""",1303344000,"04 21, 2011",2011,1984,"['Are', 'people', 'who', 'cite', 'Book', 'Revelation', 'claim', '2012', 'year', 'world', 'will', 'end', 'correct', 'film', 'eye-opening', 'thought-provoking', 'made', 'striking', 'interesting', 'images', 'teachings', 'ancient', 'Aztecs', 'Mayans', 'doom', 'civilization', 'keeper', 'ancient', 'tradition', 'Aztec', 'Medicine', 'Man', 'Medicine', 'Man', 'December', '21', '2012', 'significant', 'date', 'not', 'day', 'world', 'will', 'end', 'people', 'understood', 'world', 'cycles', 'December', '21', '2012', 'end', 'one', 'cycle', 'beginning', 'time', 'change', 'time', 'opportunity', 'improving', 'one', 'self', 'world', 'only', 'people', 'would', 'accept', 'science', 'people.The', 'Aztecs', 'Mayans', 'foresaw', 'Europeans', 'would', 'invade', 'land', 'destroy', 'culture', 'harmony', 'nature', 'obliterate', 'civilization', 'environment', 'Mexico', 'was', 'once', 'verdant', 'paradise', 'been', 'polluted', 'Mexico', 'City', 'today', 'most', 'polluted', 'city', 'world', 'Having', 'foreseen', 'upheaval', 'ancients', 'made', 'sure', 'certain', 'wise', 'men', 'would', 'go', 'underground', 'pass', 'retain', 'culture', 'Now', '468', 'years', 'Medicine', 'Man', 'disclosed', 'who', 'share', 'people', 'science', 'People', 'need', 'realize', '2012', 'time', 'change', 'physical', 'human', 'social', 'conditions', 'who', 'understand', 'who', 'can', 'change', 'will', 'prosper', 'grow', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'adjust', 'will', 'suffer', 'People', 'must', 'respect', 'everything', 'earth', 'everything', 'earth', 'part', 'single', 'organism', 'harm', 'done', 'one', 'part', 'everything', 'else', 'People', 'must', 'learn', 'more', 'earth', 'develop', 'use', 'earth', 'properly', 'must', 'rid', 'fear', 'cancer', 'today', 'societies', 'person', 'who', 'can', 'be', 'easily', 'manipulated', 'primary', 'lesson', 'love', 'love', 'everything', 'one', 'who', 'most', 'one', 'who']","2012 Prophecy Change,Apocalypse And The End Of The World -SALE! $9.99"

But being in my 6th decade, I have to confess that I have heard much of the message of ""2012 Prophecy: Change, Apocalypse and The End Of The World?"" before. A new age is about to dawn where human beings will be at peace, regaining lost knowledge that brings healing and allows them to live in harmony with the universe. Utopia, this time around, comes not from the hippy mantra ""Sex, drugs and rock and roll' but from understanding that 2012 is not an Aztec prediction of the end of time, but the beginning of an era time of transformation.The film's main character is a self-styled medicine man who claim to ""bring a message from the past."" There are many shots of him praying, chatting amiably with women, hugging children, and the like. I have no way of telling whether his message (that 2012 will not be the end of history) is worth listening to, or is just the embodiment of a self-serving prophet looking to cash in on the worries of some gullible Norde Americanos. Not to mention that the Aztecs are an odd choice for the new peace-loving race of healers. They were a warrior people who conquered those around them and demanded tribute. They also practiced large-scale human sacrifice as part of their religious observances.The film's production values were generally good, with shots of loin-cloth-clad natives re-enactors in facepaint, a soundtrack drench in of flutes and drums, and shots of beaches, sunsets and mountains. But some edges were showing. One interview, with a Greek Orthodox priest (not the kind of person prone to New Age chatter) seems to have been edited to support the film's theme. Another interview suffers from allowing the green screen to show. And the film's 50-minute length and lack of content made it seem like an extended infomercial.Thanks for the free movie, but I can't really recommend ""2012"" to anyone.

After 468 years of hiding they have returned and are sharing what their culture always taught, that 2012 is merely the end of a cycle and the time of transition.  But many would like us to live in fear, because we become easier to control and conquer.  Many film clips provide reminders of past destructive elements. Ehekateotl also tells us the Mayans never said that 2012 would be the end of the world either.The theme of the movie is to preserve, respect, and restore what we have--to live in love and gratitude--to let go of fear--to connect your heart, mind, and soul.The slightly less than one hour time period is adequate for the subject.  The music is good, the sound and picture quality are good, and the messages the film conveys parallel my own beliefs.Note that many believe 2012 is the end.  I even heard a friend's children say it.

1425950,A33PLZ7SD5MCG0,B004QP8B6K,Patty Kaye,"[0, 0]","I will begin by telling you what the documentary 2012 Prophecy Change, Apocalypse and the End of the World is not. It is not an end-of-the-world disaster movie. Nor is it an in-depth study of the Mayan calendar and how it relates to the upcoming, long-awaited, sometimes dreaded date of December 21, 2012. For this reason, I feel the name of the film is somewhat misleading and perhaps was used in order to take advantage of the current hype surrounding the predictions for next year.That said, the message Iranian-born filmmaker Shaahin Cheyene seems to be trying to share is that modern man has been progressively destroying the planet on which he lives. This is not a new thought, nor is it a wrong one. How this applies to the title of the film is what leaves me perplexed. Spiritual goodness, love, a strong emphasis on building relationships rather than war are the main topics.Finding ""god"" within yourself is another. Most of us would agree with many of the comments that are stated here, but this is certainly not a new concept. I would describe it as a remake of the late 60s and early 70s ""love and peace"" movement; a slightly different approach but basically the same message.At some point the topic of holistic medicine is interjected, most likely because Shaahin Cheyene is an herbalist and is the creator of Herbal Ecstasy products. Again, I could not understand the connection between herbal medicine and the end of the world, so it motivated me to Google Mr. Cheyene's name. You can do the same and perhaps draw your own conclusions as to why he would include it in this documentary.Going back to the film, it is stated that it is the ""white man's"" interpretation that 2012 will mark the end of times, that it is a New Age concept, and it is being hyped by mainstream media. I don't disagree entirely with that. Mainstream media will certainly make the big bucks these next few months, playing on our superstitions, curiosity, and fears. But I would have to include Shaahin Cheyene in that group since he has drawn us into his film with a title that would suggest that we are going to learn something new about what to expect on December 21, 2012. We do not.I will give the film credit for great cinematography and a nice selection of music. Somebody put a great deal of effort into that. We see artistic and candid clips of current day people and animals, the setting most often in Mexico City where it is suggested that some people are descendants of the ancient Aztecs. We also see clips of what the indigenous people (Aztecs) would have looked like. However, knowing what we do from history of the violent and ungodly nature of the Aztecs, I found myself wondering how Mr. Cheyene could use them as an example of wise and spiritual people.And so what DOES this documentary say about 2012? Mr. Cheyene presents us at the beginning of the film with a man named Miktlan Ehekateotl Kwauhtlinxan who claims to be the last of a long line of ""healers"" or medicine men and who is the carrier of the ancient tradition. This man brings a ""message"" from his people and the ""truth"" about 2012. He is a main focal point of the film. At the film's conclusion, this medicine man finally gives us his prediction; 2012 will not signal the end of the world, but rather a period of change, the end of a cycle, a transformation.At the very end of the film (after the credits and perhaps where some viewers will have already turned off the film), a clip is shown of a white man, obviously a believer in Christ evidenced by his T-shirt, carrying a sign and warning us that the book of Revelation in the Bible foretells the apocalypse and that he believes it will occur in 2012. Considering the entire content of Mr. Cheyene's documentary which totally disagrees with this thought, I can only assume that the filmmaker intended for this clip to poke fun at the ""white man's"" foolishness. I would have to say, however, that the book of Revelation is a more in-depth study of history and prophecy than what has been pulled together for this film, which seems more a study in spiritual mysticism than presentation of facts.In conclusion, I would say this film is worth watching for its beautiful cinematography and music. It is a ""peaceful"" piece of art. It is thought provoking. And as long as you don't expect anything profound or prophetic regarding 2012, you might enjoy it.",3,It is not an end-of-the-world disaster movie,1305590400,"05 17, 2011",2011,4373,"['will', 'begin', 'telling', 'what', 'documentary', '2012', 'Prophecy', 'Change', 'Apocalypse', 'End', 'World', 'not', 'not', 'end-of-the-world', 'disaster', 'movie', 'in-depth', 'study', 'Mayan', 'calendar', 'how', 'upcoming', 'long-awaited', 'sometimes', 'dreaded', 'date', 'December', '21', '2012', 'reason', 'feel', 'name', 'film', 'somewhat', 'misleading', 'perhaps', 'was', 'used', 'order', 'take', 'advantage', 'current', 'hype', 'surrounding', 'predictions', 'next', 'year.That', 'said', 'message', 'Iranian-born', 'filmmaker', 'Shaahin', 'Cheyene', 'be', 'trying', 'share', 'modern', 'man', 'been', 'progressively', 'destroying', 'planet', 'not', 'new', 'thought', 'wrong', 'one', 'How', 'title', 'film', 'what', 'perplexed', 'Spiritual', 'goodness', 'love', 'strong', 'emphasis', 'building', 'relationships', 'rather', 'war', 'are', 'main', 'topics.Finding', 'god', 'Most', 'would', 'agree', 'many', 'comments', 'are', 'stated', 'here', 'certainly', 'not', 'new', 'concept', 'would', 'describe', 'remake', 'late', '60s', 'early', '70s', 'love', 'peace', 'movement', 'slightly', 'different', 'approach', 'basically', 'same', 'message.At', 'point', 'topic', 'holistic', 'medicine', 'interjected', 'most', 'likely', 'Shaahin', 'Cheyene', 'herbalist', 'creator', 'Herbal', 'Ecstasy', 'products', 'Again', 'could', 'not', 'understand', 'connection', 'herbal', 'medicine', 'end', 'world', 'motivated', 'Google', 'Mr.', 'Cheyene', 'name', 'can', 'do', 'same', 'perhaps', 'draw', 'own', 'conclusions', 'why', 'would', 'include', 'documentary.Going', 'back', 'film', 'stated', 'white', 'man', 'interpretation', '2012', 'will', 'mark', 'end', 'times', 'New', 'Age', 'concept', 'being', 'hyped', 'mainstream', 'media', 'do', ""n't"", 'disagree', 'entirely', 'Mainstream', 'media', 'will', 'certainly', 'make', 'big', 'bucks', 'next', 'few', 'months', 'playing', 'superstitions', 'curiosity', 'fears', 'would', 'have', 'include', 'Shaahin', 'Cheyene', 'group', 'drawn', 'film', 'title', 'would', 'suggest', 'are', 'going', 'learn', 'something', 'new', 'what', 'expect', 'December', '21', '2012', 'do', 'not.I', 'will', 'give', 'film', 'credit', 'great', 'cinematography', 'nice', 'selection', 'music', 'Somebody', 'put', 'great', 'deal', 'effort', 'see', 'artistic', 'candid', 'clips', 'current', 'day', 'people', 'animals', 'setting', 'most', 'often', 'Mexico', 'City', 'where', 'suggested', 'people', 'are', 'descendants', 'ancient', 'Aztecs', 'also', 'see', 'clips', 'what', 'indigenous', 'people', 'Aztecs', 'would', 'have', 'looked', 'However', 'knowing', 'what', 'do', 'history', 'violent', 'ungodly', 'nature', 'Aztecs', 'found', 'wondering', 'how', 'Mr.', 'Cheyene', 'could', 'use', 'example', 'wise', 'spiritual', 'people.And', 'so', 'what', 'documentary', 'say', '2012', 'Mr.', 'Cheyene', 'beginning', 'film', 'man', 'named', 'Miktlan', 'Ehekateotl', 'Kwauhtlinxan', 'who', 'be', 'last', 'long', 'line', 'healers', 'medicine', 'men', 'who', 'carrier', 'ancient', 'tradition', 'man', 'message', 'people', 'truth', '2012', 'main', 'focal', 'point', 'film', 'film', 'conclusion', 'medicine', 'man', 'finally', 'prediction', '2012', 'will', 'not', 'signal', 'end', 'world', 'rather', 'period', 'change', 'end', 'cycle', 'transformation.At', 'very', 'end', 'film', 'credits', 'perhaps', 'where', 'viewers', 'will', 'have', 'already', 'turned', 'off', 'film', 'clip', 'shown', 'white', 'man', 'obviously', 'believer', 'Christ', 'evidenced', 'T-shirt', 'carrying', 'sign', 'warning', 'book', 'Revelation', 'Bible', 'apocalypse', 'will', 'occur', '2012', 'Considering', 'entire', 'content', 'Mr.', 'Cheyene', 'documentary', 'totally', 'thought', 'can', 'only', 'assume', 'filmmaker', 'intended', 'clip', 'poke', 'fun', 'white', 'man', 'foolishness', 'would', 'have', 'say', 'however', 'book', 'Revelation', 'more', 'in-depth', 'study', 'history', 'prophecy', 'what', 'been', 'pulled', 'together', 'film', 'more', 'study', 'spiritual', 'mysticism', 'presentation', 'facts.In', 'conclusion', 'would', 'say', 'film', 'worth', 'watching', 'beautiful', 'cinematography', 'music', 'peaceful', 'piece', 'art', 'thought', 'provoking', 'as', 'long', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'anything', 'profound', 'prophetic', 'regarding', '2012', 'might', 'enjoy']","2012 Prophecy Change,Apocalypse And The End Of The World -SALE! $9.99"

It was well done, interesting, and a whole lot more hopeful than anything else coming out about 2012.  After hearing what an Aztec elder had to say about the date, I couldn't help but imagine how the indigenous people must chuckle at our over-the-top reactions to what is only a turning of the page of their ancient calendar.As 2012 Prophecy Change,Apocalypse And The End Of The World, explains, the world moves in and out of cycles just as we move through the seasons every year.  For whatever reasons, the Aztecs and the Mayans, and probably other native peoples, could see the long cycles coming and going.  Apparently we are leaving the current cycle and maybe that's not such a bad thing.  As the film explains, our western civilization see things in 'my' mode, rather than a 'we' mode which is how natures sees things.  Since we are going against nature, our way of life is not sustainable.  Maybe we should be looking towards the indigenous people for answers to our society's ills.  They've been around for thousands of years, raising their families and keeping the earth is pristine condition, so it wouldn't hurt to give them a listen.Shaahin Cheyene, the director narrates the film and does a great job of it.  He's calm, intelligent, and sincere and speaks well on his subject.  The scenery is powerful, but it's the Aztec elder who lends weight to this film.  The screen lights up every time you see him.  One of the facts that I didn't know was that during the time of the conquistadors, many of the knowledgeable Aztecs were sent away to preserve their knowledge, coming back to their people when it was safe.One of my favorite parts of the film was the music.  It was obviously native music, flutes and such, and it fit the film wonderfully.  Another part of the film that stood out, was a young native dancer who embodied both grace and power as he danced with two sticks throughout the film.  Cheyene made a film that honored the native people, giving us hope as the clock ticks down to the dreaded date of December 21, 2012.Even if this date weren't looming in our lives, this film should be shown in schools to show our youth that there is an alternative to the survival of the fittest mentality that we are currently living.",4,Good news about 2012,1303430400,"04 22, 2011",2011,2350,"['was', 'asked', 'review', 'film', 'given', 'free', 'copy', 'do', 'so', 'said', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'was', 'well', 'done', 'interesting', 'whole', 'lot', 'more', 'hopeful', 'anything', 'else', 'coming', 'out', '2012', 'hearing', 'what', 'Aztec', 'elder', 'had', 'say', 'date', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'imagine', 'how', 'indigenous', 'people', 'must', 'chuckle', 'over-the-top', 'reactions', 'what', 'only', 'turning', 'page', 'ancient', 'calendar.As', '2012', 'Prophecy', 'Change', 'Apocalypse', 'End', 'World', 'world', 'cycles', 'just', 'move', 'seasons', 'year', 'reasons', 'Aztecs', 'Mayans', 'probably', 'other', 'native', 'peoples', 'could', 'see', 'long', 'cycles', 'coming', 'going', 'Apparently', 'are', 'leaving', 'current', 'cycle', 'maybe', 'not', 'such', 'bad', 'thing', 'film', 'western', 'civilization', 'see', 'things', ""'my"", 'mode', 'rather', ""'we"", 'mode', 'how', 'natures', 'things', 'are', 'going', 'nature', 'way', 'life', 'not', 'sustainable', 'Maybe', 'should', 'be', 'looking', 'indigenous', 'people', 'answers', 'society', 'ills', ""'ve"", 'been', 'thousands', 'years', 'raising', 'families', 'keeping', 'earth', 'pristine', 'condition', 'would', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'give', 'listen.Shaahin', 'Cheyene', 'director', 'film', 'great', 'job', 'calm', 'intelligent', 'sincere', 'speaks', 'well', 'subject', 'scenery', 'powerful', 'Aztec', 'elder', 'who', 'weight', 'film', 'screen', 'up', 'time', 'see', 'One', 'facts', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'was', 'time', 'conquistadors', 'many', 'knowledgeable', 'Aztecs', 'were', 'sent', 'away', 'preserve', 'knowledge', 'coming', 'back', 'people', 'when', 'was', 'safe.One', 'favorite', 'parts', 'film', 'was', 'music', 'was', 'obviously', 'native', 'music', 'flutes', 'such', 'fit', 'film', 'wonderfully', 'part', 'film', 'stood', 'out', 'was', 'young', 'native', 'dancer', 'who', 'embodied', 'grace', 'power', 'danced', 'two', 'sticks', 'film', 'Cheyene', 'made', 'film', 'honored', 'native', 'people', 'giving', 'hope', 'clock', 'down', 'dreaded', 'date', 'December', '21', '2012.Even', 'date', 'were', ""n't"", 'looming', 'lives', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'shown', 'schools', 'show', 'youth', 'alternative', 'survival', 'fittest', 'mentality', 'are', 'currently', 'living']","2012 Prophecy Change,Apocalypse And The End Of The World -SALE! $9.99"

These films are not as far-removed from each other as you might think. Both are jeremiads, the former being decidedly more-restrained and less pessimistic.There have been several TV documentaries on the supposed apocalypse (which, by the way, means an uncovering or unfolding, not destruction) awaiting us at the ""end"" of the Mayan calendar in 2012. A few have been sober analyses; most have been irresponsible ""info porn"", designed to titillate the viewer.This is one of the sober ones. It repeatedly states that the Mayan calendar marks the end of a ""sun"" (era), and that a new and different era will follow. The principal narrator (Shaahin Cheyene) emphasizes that change and disaster are common to all eras, and the current one is no different.The film then becomes a promotion for its producers' world view -- that Western civilization is excessively exploitative and destructive; that personal relationships are more important than material possessions; that most of the world's problems stem from bad or misdirected values. Unless you're Bernie Madoff, it's hard to disagree with this.Most of the people interviewed /do/ feel the Mayan calender is tuned into some ""cosmic vibration"", and the change in ""suns"" will include signficant (and generally favorable) alterations in society, economics, and human thought -- but not Roland-Emerich mass destruction.Some viewers will see this film as no more than the blather of modern hippies. Most of the interviewees seemed, to me, to be sober, serious folk trying to encourage people to reconsider their lives.""2012 Prophecy"" touched on a number of things I've been thinking about recently, and kicked me (a bit) to consider where my life is headed.
