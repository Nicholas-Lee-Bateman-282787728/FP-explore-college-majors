The first two thirds of the film is actually a disturbingly realistic portrayal of the complete victimization of a person. Michelle is a shy, smart, attractive and poor girl who is sent to school in an affluent area in order to receive the educational benefits. She prefers reading alone to trying to compete with her rich, shallow classmates, until a charming athlete convinces her to go to a house party with the cool kids. By the end of the night Michelle is drugged, gang-raped, degraded and humiliated. Following the ordeal, everyone in her life, including her own mother, blames her for everything, and her reputation is destroyed.There is nothing melodramatic about the way the film depicts Michelle's transformation from devastated victim to avenging assassin. And although the film ceases to be realistic when Michelle begins murdering both the boys who raped her and the girls who turned on her, it's satisfying.",4,Satisfying,1187049600,"08 14, 2007",2007,1041,"['Talk', 'false', 'advertising', 'cover', 'DVD', 'look', 'cheesy', 'exploitation', 'revenge', 'movie', 'not', 'first', 'two', 'thirds', 'film', 'actually', 'disturbingly', 'realistic', 'portrayal', 'complete', 'victimization', 'person', 'Michelle', 'shy', 'smart', 'attractive', 'poor', 'girl', 'who', 'sent', 'school', 'affluent', 'area', 'order', 'receive', 'educational', 'benefits', 'reading', 'alone', 'trying', 'compete', 'rich', 'shallow', 'classmates', 'charming', 'athlete', 'convinces', 'go', 'house', 'party', 'cool', 'kids', 'end', 'night', 'Michelle', 'drugged', 'gang-raped', 'degraded', 'humiliated', 'Following', 'ordeal', 'everyone', 'life', 'including', 'own', 'mother', 'everything', 'reputation', 'destroyed.There', 'nothing', 'melodramatic', 'way', 'film', 'Michelle', 'transformation', 'devastated', 'victim', 'avenging', 'assassin', 'film', 'be', 'realistic', 'when', 'Michelle', 'murdering', 'boys', 'who', 'raped', 'girls', 'who', 'turned', 'satisfying']",Bad Reputation
1081393,A8NAERR5LGFI3,B000RFWYNO,iluv2befit,"[1, 1]",I really enjoyed this movie even though it is very low budget. It goes to show you that with the right direction a movie can be a lot of fun without being big budget. The main character does a really good job in this movie and you really do feel for her.  So when she goes on her rampage you love it. I was also impressed that a lot of the characters in this movie can act pretty well and could easily act in bigger budget movies which isn't always the case with B horror.  This is worth a watch- a fun way to spend an hour and half. 4/5,4,One of the better b horror movies out there,1272672000,"05 1, 2010",2010,537,"['really', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'even', 'very', 'low', 'budget', 'show', 'right', 'direction', 'movie', 'can', 'be', 'lot', 'fun', 'being', 'big', 'budget', 'main', 'character', 'really', 'good', 'job', 'movie', 'really', 'do', 'feel', 'So', 'when', 'rampage', 'love', 'was', 'also', 'impressed', 'lot', 'characters', 'movie', 'can', 'act', 'pretty', 'well', 'could', 'easily', 'act', 'bigger', 'budget', 'movies', ""n't"", 'always', 'case', 'B', 'horror', 'watch-', 'fun', 'way', 'spend', 'hour', 'half', '4/5']",Bad Reputation

Yes yet another revenge film in the realms of I Spit on Your Grave.  So pack up your troubles and count your blessings this is Bad Reputation.Arrrgh there be SPOILERS in these here waters...Our story opens with the school outcast Michelle.  An attractive but shy girl that just wants to fit in with the cool kids and as luck would have it out of the blue star football player walks over and is above and beyond friendly with her.  He invites her to a huge party and tells her she would be missing out otherwise in a typical aloof manner.  Naturally she accepts and goes home to tell Mom who I swear was channeled from Carrie.  Still she was a bit calmer than Piper Laurie but that is like comparing getting hit in the head with a rock rather than ball bat. Mom gets told off and Michelle puts on her tart outfit and gets ready for a night of fun.  The first of the possible many rites of passage in teenage years when shock and gasp when she gets roofied and jocko offers her sweet words in private and looks to be a night of romance until...bum bum bum... yeah he and his two buddies start using her for the night.  Another gasp of pure disbelief that afterwards Jocko claims she came on to them and she loved every minute of it.  Quicker than you can say, ""What the hell?"" she is branded a slut by the school and the rumor mill starts kicking in.  Duct taped to a tree and labeled slut on her forehead I am sure Michelle was flashing back where the last couple of days all went wrong.  No sooner has the former Miss Goody Two Shoes tossed them and the kid gloves in one sitting...well maybe Carrie... or I Spit on Your Grave... or just about every other rape/revenge flick I have ever encountered.  Last House on the Left of course does not get that same billing.  Watch it if you have no clue what I am referring to.Writer/Director Jim Hemphill first time at bat and on a meager budget attempts to pay homage to Carrie and I Spit on Your Grave at the same time.  The writing is solid, the dialogue is pretty dead on and frankly the story is bigger than the shoestring budget he had to work on.  Production managed very well we little to know twirly cam routine of the current horror movie caliber.  Channel the inner Roger Corman, Hemphill.  Keep the budget down.  You know, that is until you get the soulless producer that seems to create gold coins from his butt.This was not actually a bad film.  Granted in no way, shape or form was an original plot line but hell Hemphill tried to make it his own.  I feel with a bit more budget and little more stunt coordination this would have been a bit more realistic.  Obviously in this teen angst/revenge genre you have to suspend disbelief to a degree like gossip about a murder and who do you think would even have a reason to be responsible for such a horrific act of revenge.  Again you really cannot ask a slasher movie to be grounded in logic because people would never behave the way they do in horror movies of this sub-genre.  So for a first attempt I say well done Hemphill, I know now to avoid timid and demure little blondes that make have a savage streak in them.",4,Bad Reputation,1337817600,"05 24, 2012",2012,3267,"['title', 'alone', 'will', 'conjure', 'Joan', 'Jett', 'song', 'all', 'own', 'course', 'reviewer', 'did', 'not', 'go', 'film', 'eyes', 'shut', 'thankfully', 'Yes', 'yet', 'revenge', 'film', 'realms', 'Spit', 'Grave', 'So', 'pack', 'up', 'troubles', 'count', 'blessings', 'Bad', 'Reputation.Arrrgh', 'be', 'SPOILERS', 'here', 'waters', 'story', 'school', 'outcast', 'Michelle', 'attractive', 'shy', 'girl', 'just', 'fit', 'cool', 'kids', 'luck', 'would', 'have', 'blue', 'star', 'football', 'player', 'walks', 'above', 'friendly', 'huge', 'party', 'would', 'be', 'missing', 'out', 'otherwise', 'typical', 'aloof', 'manner', 'Naturally', 'home', 'tell', 'Mom', 'who', 'swear', 'was', 'channeled', 'Carrie', 'Still', 'was', 'bit', 'calmer', 'Piper', 'Laurie', 'comparing', 'getting', 'hit', 'head', 'rock', 'rather', 'ball', 'bat', 'Mom', 'told', 'off', 'Michelle', 'tart', 'outfit', 'ready', 'night', 'fun', 'first', 'possible', 'many', 'rites', 'passage', 'teenage', 'years', 'when', 'shock', 'gasp', 'when', 'roofied', 'jocko', 'offers', 'sweet', 'words', 'private', 'be', 'night', 'romance', 'bum', 'bum', 'bum', 'two', 'buddies', 'start', 'using', 'night', 'gasp', 'pure', 'disbelief', 'afterwards', 'Jocko', 'came', 'loved', 'minute', 'Quicker', 'can', 'say', 'What', 'hell', 'branded', 'slut', 'school', 'rumor', 'mill', 'kicking', 'Duct', 'taped', 'tree', 'labeled', 'slut', 'forehead', 'am', 'sure', 'Michelle', 'was', 'flashing', 'back', 'where', 'last', 'couple', 'days', 'went', 'wrong', 'sooner', 'former', 'Miss', 'Goody', 'Two', 'Shoes', 'tossed', 'kid', 'one', 'sitting', 'well', 'maybe', 'Carrie', 'Spit', 'Your', 'Grave', 'just', 'other', 'rape/revenge', 'flick', 'have', 'ever', 'encountered', 'Last', 'House', 'Left', 'course', 'not', 'get', 'same', 'billing', 'Watch', 'have', 'clue', 'what', 'am', 'referring', 'to.Writer/Director', 'Jim', 'Hemphill', 'first', 'time', 'bat', 'meager', 'budget', 'attempts', 'pay', 'homage', 'Carrie', 'Spit', 'Your', 'Grave', 'same', 'time', 'writing', 'solid', 'dialogue', 'pretty', 'dead', 'frankly', 'story', 'bigger', 'shoestring', 'budget', 'had', 'work', 'Production', 'managed', 'very', 'well', 'little', 'know', 'twirly', 'cam', 'routine', 'current', 'horror', 'movie', 'caliber', 'Channel', 'inner', 'Roger', 'Corman', 'Hemphill', 'Keep', 'budget', 'down', 'know', 'get', 'soulless', 'producer', 'create', 'gold', 'coins', 'butt.This', 'was', 'not', 'actually', 'bad', 'film', 'Granted', 'way', 'shape', 'form', 'was', 'original', 'plot', 'line', 'hell', 'Hemphill', 'tried', 'make', 'own', 'feel', 'bit', 'more', 'budget', 'little', 'more', 'stunt', 'coordination', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'bit', 'more', 'realistic', 'Obviously', 'teen', 'angst/revenge', 'genre', 'have', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'degree', 'gossip', 'murder', 'who', 'do', 'think', 'would', 'even', 'have', 'reason', 'be', 'responsible', 'such', 'horrific', 'act', 'revenge', 'Again', 'really', 'can', 'not', 'ask', 'slasher', 'movie', 'be', 'grounded', 'logic', 'people', 'would', 'never', 'behave', 'way', 'do', 'horror', 'movies', 'sub-genre', 'So', 'first', 'attempt', 'say', 'well', 'done', 'Hemphill', 'know', 'now', 'avoid', 'timid', 'demure', 'little', 'blondes', 'make', 'have', 'savage', 'streak']",Bad Reputation
