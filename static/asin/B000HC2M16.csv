1012084,A2EEUQ81DTY7G3,B000HC2M16,A Customer,"[11, 11]","Here it is again - every gay stereotype imaginable. But that doesn't mean that The Mostly Unfabulous Social Life of Ethan Green isn't watchable, or even entertaining. The film is habitually bright and fast paced - even if it does stall a little bit in the second act - and has a lot of zingy gay humor, mostly in the form of a lot of acerbic one-liners.However, to the film's detriment it's production values make it look like a low budget cable TV sitcom than a fully-fledged motion picture and the although George Bamber's direction is lissome, the film is sort of all over the place. Still, Ethan Green is buoyed along by the screen charisma and the ineffable cuteness of the 26-year-old title character played with much panache by Daniel Letterle.The plot is pretty much de rigor, following the tried and true path of gay romantic comedy. Ethan Green (Letterle) is unlucky in love and is constantly on the hunt for Mr. Right. His choices however are somewhat questionable. Although he's great sex, the hunky, out-of-the-closet professional baseball player Kyle Underhill (Diego Serrano) isn't exactly giving him the emotional fulfillment he needs.While Ethan tells his best friend Charlotte (Shanola Hampton) that Kyle's still married and a bit of a basket case, but this doesn't bother Ethan nearly as much as his impending eviction from the house he and Charlotte rent from Ethan's ex-boyfriend Leo (David Monahan). Determined to stall the sale, Ethan employs the prissy - and terribly promiscuous - young real estate agent (Dean Shelton) who's helping get the house sold as slowly as possible.Amidst all the antics and all the young faces, Meredith Baxter makes an appearance as Ethan's trendy mum who is not only more than comfortable with her son's sexuality, but even arranges same-sex weddings! Ethan's two best friends pop up in the form of character actors Joel Brooks and Richard Riehle as ""The Hat Sisters,"" a longtime couple with a flair for eye-catching millinery.There aren't any huge surprises in The Social Life of Ethan Green and the film isn't trying to make any great statements. And the boy that Ethan eventually ends up with doesn't come as any great shock - most viewers will realize pretty early on that Ethan was meant to be with him.The film is also sane and fun and comparatively innocent, even though there's a matter-of-fact, often explicit treatment of gay sex which may shock some of the more prudish viewers. Some may also find the irresolute, narcissistic and somewhat egocentric title character more irritating than appealing - I loved him! Yet overall, the film an appealingly modest, light-hearted and unpretentious charmer that can be forgiven for its shortcomings and for its penchant towards school play amateurism.

1012087,A3DVS9Y4Z1HIDJ,B000HC2M16,"Bob Lind ""camelwest""","[4, 4]","""The Mostly Unfabulous Social Life of Ethan Green"" (2005) is a very light romantic comedy which does a commendable job in capturing the whimsical nature of Ethan Orner's syndicated comic strip on which it is loosely based. Ethan is the twentysomething gay everyman, always stumbling into new relationships that he quickly abandons because he feels something is missing.  His living situation is also up in the air, as his lesbian roommate and he have to find a new place, since Leo (his ex-boyfriend) is selling the house, which he owns.  His mother (played by Meridith Bazter) is a gay wedding planner, who lives with another one of Ethan's ex-boyfriends.  Most of his friends all joke about his bad luck with men.  Then there are the ""Hat Sisters"" ... two older gay men (Veteran character actors Joel Brooks and Richard Riehle, in scene steeling roles)who dress in drag and carry out daring political activism.When we join Ethan, he meets a hunky baseball player, Diego, who he has a whirlwind romance with ... for a while.  Looking at an old video when he moved into their current house, Ethan rekindles a spark with Leo, and tries to win him back, but finds that he is planning a commitment ceremony with someone else.  Ethan gets sidetracked into a casual relationship with a 19 year old twink real estate agent, who helps him hatch a plot to delay the sale of the house.  The film is generally an amusing, heartfelt piece, with the exception of some forced slapstick scenes that just don't work.  Daniel Letterle (""Camp"") is great in the title role.DVD extras include alternate opening scene (which features Reichen, Lance Bass' new boyfriend), director commentary and a brief featurette about the original cartoon strip.  Originally produced for Here!TV, and rated R (simulated sex scenes, but no nudity).",4,Breezy comedy based on gay comic strip,1160697600,"10 13, 2006",2006,1812,"['Mostly', 'Unfabulous', 'Social', 'Life', 'Ethan', 'Green', '2005', 'very', 'light', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'commendable', 'job', 'capturing', 'whimsical', 'nature', 'Ethan', 'Orner', 'syndicated', 'comic', 'strip', 'loosely', 'based', 'Ethan', 'twentysomething', 'gay', 'everyman', 'always', 'stumbling', 'new', 'relationships', 'quickly', 'abandons', 'something', 'missing', 'living', 'situation', 'also', 'up', 'air', 'lesbian', 'roommate', 'have', 'find', 'new', 'place', 'Leo', 'ex-boyfriend', 'selling', 'house', 'mother', 'played', 'Meridith', 'Bazter', 'gay', 'wedding', 'planner', 'who', 'one', 'Ethan', 'ex-boyfriends', 'Most', 'friends', 'joke', 'bad', 'luck', 'men', 'Then', 'are', 'Hat', 'Sisters', 'two', 'older', 'gay', 'men', 'Veteran', 'character', 'actors', 'Joel', 'Brooks', 'Richard', 'Riehle', 'scene', 'steeling', 'roles', 'who', 'dress', 'drag', 'carry', 'out', 'daring', 'political', 'activism.When', 'join', 'Ethan', 'hunky', 'baseball', 'player', 'Diego', 'who', 'whirlwind', 'romance', 'while', 'Looking', 'old', 'video', 'when', 'moved', 'current', 'house', 'Ethan', 'spark', 'Leo', 'tries', 'win', 'back', 'planning', 'commitment', 'ceremony', 'someone', 'else', 'Ethan', 'sidetracked', 'casual', 'relationship', '19', 'year', 'old', 'twink', 'real', 'estate', 'agent', 'who', 'hatch', 'plot', 'delay', 'sale', 'house', 'film', 'generally', 'amusing', 'heartfelt', 'piece', 'exception', 'forced', 'slapstick', 'scenes', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'work', 'Daniel', 'Letterle', 'Camp', 'great', 'title', 'role.DVD', 'extras', 'include', 'alternate', 'opening', 'scene', 'Reichen', 'Lance', 'Bass', 'new', 'boyfriend', 'director', 'commentary', 'brief', 'featurette', 'original', 'cartoon', 'strip', 'Originally', 'produced', 'Here', 'TV', 'rated', 'R', 'simulated', 'sex', 'scenes', 'nudity']",The Mostly Unfabulous Social Life of Ethan Green

My favorite character (from an acting standpoint) was most likely Punch, the young 19-year old junior executive type guy.When it was funny (the hat ladies), it was good, when it wasn't, it was just so-so.

Even if I had, this wouldn't have been the movie I came up with.Moving the action from Boston to LA doesn't affect things much, so I settled down to watch. Almost exactly twenty minutes into the movie, the character of Ethan makes an incredibly stupid move (an inconsistent move with his behavior and attitude in the PREVIOUS SCENE) and the film started to lose me.  The movie has a lot of problems with the storytelling and pace but the main problem is the casting.Daniel Letterle is completely miscast as Ethan; he isn't able to carry the movie or make Ethan especially real. Letterle is also unable to muster up any chemistry with any of his co-stars, especially the equally miscast Dean Shelton as Punch.  Punch is supposed to be so cute that he's irresistible, but the character lacks the charisma necessary for the role as well as any sense of decent comic timing.  Every line Punch tosses off feels forced (when you can understand him) and from certain angles, he bears a startling resemblance to Hard Candy's Ellen Page.  Other characters remain underdeveloped and exist at the perimeter until they're needed.The movie tries all kinds of wacky situations that don't come off well and even resorts to the old cliche of the person marrying somebody whom they don't love.  True, the twist this time is it's a same-sex ceremony but it still feels as tired as ever.It's always nice to see Meredith Baxter doing something more than Lifetime movies, and Joel Brooks is perfect as one of the Hat Sisters but they alone aren't enough to redeem this movie.",1,1.5 stars,1168041600,"01 6, 2007",2007,1684,"['loved', 'Ethan', 'Green', 'comic', 'strip', 'early', '90s', 'never', 'really', 'thought', 'what', 'would', 'be', 'were', 'movie', 'Even', 'had', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'movie', 'came', 'up', 'with.Moving', 'action', 'Boston', 'LA', ""n't"", 'affect', 'things', 'much', 'settled', 'down', 'watch', 'Almost', 'exactly', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'movie', 'character', 'Ethan', 'incredibly', 'stupid', 'move', 'inconsistent', 'move', 'behavior', 'attitude', 'PREVIOUS', 'SCENE', 'film', 'started', 'lose', 'movie', 'lot', 'problems', 'storytelling', 'pace', 'main', 'problem', 'casting.Daniel', 'Letterle', 'completely', 'miscast', 'Ethan', ""n't"", 'able', 'carry', 'movie', 'make', 'Ethan', 'especially', 'real', 'Letterle', 'also', 'unable', 'muster', 'up', 'chemistry', 'co-stars', 'especially', 'equally', 'miscast', 'Dean', 'Shelton', 'Punch', 'Punch', 'supposed', 'be', 'so', 'cute', 'irresistible', 'character', 'charisma', 'necessary', 'role', 'as', 'well', 'sense', 'decent', 'comic', 'timing', 'line', 'Punch', 'feels', 'forced', 'when', 'can', 'understand', 'certain', 'angles', 'startling', 'resemblance', 'Hard', 'Candy', 'Ellen', 'Page', 'Other', 'characters', 'remain', 'underdeveloped', 'exist', 'perimeter', ""'re"", 'needed.The', 'movie', 'kinds', 'wacky', 'situations', 'do', ""n't"", 'come', 'off', 'well', 'even', 'resorts', 'old', 'cliche', 'person', 'marrying', 'somebody', 'whom', 'do', ""n't"", 'love', 'True', 'twist', 'time', 'same-sex', 'ceremony', 'still', 'as', 'tired', 'ever.It', 'always', 'nice', 'see', 'Meredith', 'Baxter', 'doing', 'something', 'more', 'Lifetime', 'movies', 'Joel', 'Brooks', 'perfect', 'one', 'Hat', 'Sisters', 'alone', 'are', ""n't"", 'enough', 'redeem', 'movie']",The Mostly Unfabulous Social Life of Ethan Green

George Bamber takes on his first directing role and uses a comic strip (Eric Orner) translated for the screen by David Vernon and populates his movie with an attractive cast of men (and women) and ably manages to make the individual frames of a comic strip almost become a smooth storyline.Ethan Green (the talented Daniel Letterle) has problems with relationships: he has been in many from Juarez (Ramon De Ocampo) who still lives with Ethan's gay boy loving mother Harper (Meredith Baxter), to previously closeted baseball player Leo (Diego Serrano), to Kyle (David Monahan) to the very young Punch (Dean Shelton).  The crux of the story revolves around the difficulty of selling Leo's house and the ways in which the various ex-lovers interact provides the somewhat frustrating line of dialogue.Comic relief is supplied by two elderly gentlemen known as the Hat Sisters (Joel Brooks and Richard Riehle) as well as the shenanigans of the real estate people.  Of course we know from the beginning who will end up with whom, but the getting there is fairly fun. The cast obviously has such a good time with the film that they forget to enunciate and so much of the dialogue is swallowed.  But they are all fun  to watch so it matters little that the superficial aspects of the story remain sub rosa. Grady Harp, October 06",3,'A Bit of Pate?'

Although it took a lot of choices to create an eighty-eight minute movie out of sixteen years of comic strips, the result does capture the social whirl, the promise, and the despair of Ethan Green's life.Ethan Green (Daniel Letterle) is a 26-year old gay man who has joined with lesbian Charlotte (Shanola Hampton) to rent a house from Ethan's old heart-throb Leo (David Monahan).  Ethan has just started a fling with a married, just-out-of-the-closet baseball player, Kyle (Diego Sorrano).  When Leo decides to sell the house, Ethan gets a suggestion from cute 19-year old Punch (Dean Shelton) to use the services of depressed Sunny Deal (Rebecca Lowman) to delay any sale.  Ethan and others get advice from Ethan's mom (Meredith Baxter) and the two Hat Sisters (Richard Riehle and Joel Brooks).  Meanwhile Leo may have developed an interest in a Log Cabin Republican, and Kyle may like Jason Chang.  Ethan's tendency to push people away if they get too close sets yo-yo relationships into action.  It all resolves happily enough, although Ethan has the opportunity to spoil things enough to generate a sequel.Since this is a lower-budget production, there was little opportunity to illustrate the science-fiction sorts of themes that were in the strip.  To offset this, Eric Ormer was able to create an animated cartoon sequence illuminating one character.The acting was pretty good overall.  I thought the Hat Sisters and Ethan's mother were exactly as they were in the comics.  Ethan here is nicer and more passive than in the comics.  He is cruised but doesn't cruise, he can resist having sex even when his angel allows it, and he relies on advice to initiate action.  In the strip, Ethan is frequently depressed or hostile; in the film Ethan slows down some to consider matters but doesn't get into a funk, other than one scene with Charlotte where he repeatedly calls his own behavior self-destructive.  The movie is happy with a dash of farce.  It's not a problem or unprecedented, just a choice.Skin shots are plentiful.  Ethan has the most, but Kyle, Punch, Leo, and Juarez (Ramon de Ocampo), an ex of Ethan living with his mother, get to show off too.The extras are a commentary track by the director, screenwriter, and executive producer, an alternative opening scene with optional commentary, the trailer, a short featurette by Eric Orner giving the history of the comic strip, and some other trailers.  You might check out Orner's Ethan Green comic books in the book section too.The film is able to link many of the traditional brief strips together into a coherent story arc.  Fans of the comic strip need not hesitate.  People not familiar with the strip will not be disadvantaged.

That we are able to make fun movies that exist for no other reason than to entertain is a departure from the heavy, highly sociopolitical dramas that have dominated for much of the genre's history (i.e. Longtime Companion, And the Band Played On, Angels in America, etc).

I know many people who are very much like the characters in this movie, and I think the somewhat sugar-coated point of the movie - that relationships are not easy but they do require tolerance, patience and ultimately two people who are very much self-aware and honest about who and what they are - was easy to digest.Watch it with friends as an alternative to hitting the bars one night.",4,Fun and Enjoyable,1162339200,"11 1, 2006",2006,1318,"['refreshing', 'see', 'lighthearted', 'gay', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'what', 'fun', 'story', 'cute', 'characters', 'plenty', 'light', 'comedy.Casting', 'was', 'done', 'perfectly', 'none', 'characters', 'requird', 'Oscar-worthy', 'performances', 'cast', 'members', 'were', 'well-suited', 'roles.I', 'think', 'seeing', 'more', 'movies', 'indication', 'where', 'gay', 'cinema', 'gay', 'community', 'currently', 'are', 'able', 'make', 'fun', 'movies', 'exist', 'other', 'reason', 'entertain', 'departure', 'heavy', 'highly', 'sociopolitical', 'dramas', 'have', 'dominated', 'much', 'genre', 'history', 'i.e', 'Longtime', 'Companion', 'Band', 'Played', 'Angels', 'America', 'etc', 'movies', 'are', 'brilliant', 'important', 'nice', 'have', 'fun.The', 'plot', 'already', 'been', 'summarized', 'will', 'point', 'out', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'characters', 'overly-stereotypical', 'especially', 'not', 'derogatory', 'sense', 'know', 'many', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'very', 'much', 'characters', 'movie', 'think', 'somewhat', 'sugar-coated', 'point', 'movie', 'relationships', 'are', 'not', 'easy', 'do', 'require', 'tolerance', 'patience', 'ultimately', 'two', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'very', 'much', 'self-aware', 'honest', 'who', 'what', 'are', 'was', 'easy', 'digest.Watch', 'friends', 'alternative', 'hitting', 'bars', 'one', 'night']",The Mostly Unfabulous Social Life of Ethan Green

We have a twink teenager, hunky ex-boyfriends (including a recently married baseball player played by Diego Serrano), a Log Cabin Republican and of course, the Hat Sisters (hilariously portrayed by Joel Brooks and Richard Riehle) who are based on real people in Massachusetts.The stereotypes come in many ways, but mostly in the round-robin relationships shown by the gay men in their 20s (or in the case of Punch, almost 20s), but most stereotypes are borne in truth, so it does ring genuine in that respect.  What seems more wishful than real is the super-over-supportive mother played by Meredith Baxter.  She's an awesome actress, but the character is more gay-friendly than Debbie on Queer as Folk.In listening to the commentary by the Director, Screenwriter and Exec Producer, you learn a lot about how they made this film on such a low budget and with the help of their friends.  At one point, the commentators actually wonder if anyone was still listening to their commentary - I was and it was very insightful - worth listening to if you have the time.All in all, a fun film... a good way to spend an hour and a half.  A good deal of the cast is straight, which is a testament to their acting ability.  Letterle and Serrano specifically do very well in their parts which is not always the case when a straight actor plays gay.",4,A low budget fun time...,1182124800,"06 18, 2007",2007,2269,"[""'m"", 'not', 'familiar', 'comic', 'strip', 'movie', 'based', 'did', 'watch', 'special', 'feature', 'author', 'Eric', 'Orner', 'happy', 'transition', 'pen', 'ink', 'live', 'action', 'film', 'then', ""'d"", 'suggest', 'was', 'success', 'who', ""'d"", 'know', 'better', 'overall', 'story', 'Ethan', 'Green', '26', 'year-old', 'guy', 'who', 'continually', 'fail', 'relationships.I', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'film', 'twice', 'course', 'week', 'was', 'really', 'intrigued', 'stereotypes', 'exhibited', 'movie', 'Ethan', 'played', 'quite', 'talentedly', 'Daniel', 'Letterle', 'characterized', 'serial', 'monogamist', 'monagamy', 'might', 'only', 'last', 'day', 'two', 'case', 'fling', 'Punch', 'Epstein', 'played', 'Dean', 'Shelton', 'Next', 'have', 'lesbian', 'roomate', 'strongly', 'delivered', 'Shanola', 'Hampton', 'who', 'former', 'girlfriend', 'pictures', 'replacing', 'picture', 'cat', 'have', 'twink', 'teenager', 'hunky', 'ex-boyfriends', 'including', 'recently', 'married', 'baseball', 'player', 'played', 'Diego', 'Serrano', 'Log', 'Cabin', 'Republican', 'course', 'Hat', 'Sisters', 'hilariously', 'portrayed', 'Joel', 'Brooks', 'Richard', 'Riehle', 'who', 'are', 'based', 'real', 'people', 'Massachusetts.The', 'stereotypes', 'come', 'many', 'ways', 'mostly', 'round-robin', 'relationships', 'shown', 'gay', 'men', '20s', 'case', 'Punch', 'almost', '20s', 'most', 'stereotypes', 'are', 'borne', 'truth', 'ring', 'genuine', 'respect', 'What', 'more', 'wishful', 'real', 'super-over-supportive', 'mother', 'played', 'Meredith', 'Baxter', 'awesome', 'actress', 'character', 'more', 'gay-friendly', 'Debbie', 'Queer', 'Folk.In', 'listening', 'commentary', 'Director', 'Screenwriter', 'Exec', 'Producer', 'learn', 'lot', 'how', 'made', 'film', 'low', 'budget', 'help', 'friends', 'one', 'point', 'commentators', 'actually', 'wonder', 'anyone', 'was', 'still', 'listening', 'commentary', 'was', 'was', 'very', 'insightful', 'worth', 'listening', 'have', 'time.All', 'fun', 'film', 'good', 'way', 'spend', 'hour', 'half', 'good', 'deal', 'cast', 'straight', 'testament', 'acting', 'ability', 'Letterle', 'Serrano', 'specifically', 'do', 'very', 'well', 'parts', 'not', 'always', 'case', 'when', 'straight', 'actor', 'plays', 'gay']",The Mostly Unfabulous Social Life of Ethan Green
