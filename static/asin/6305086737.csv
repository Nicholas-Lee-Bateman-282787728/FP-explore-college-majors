447969,AIMR915K4YCN,6305086737,"Bindy Sue Frnknschtein ""bigfootsalienbaby""","[0, 0]","After a horrific childhood flash-back sequence, involving a group of young schoolgirls and a murderous boy in a yellow raincoat, we are introduced to the adult Claire Mullins (Jennifer Jostyn). She takes a teaching job in her old elementary school. Claire soon begins to see a boy in a yellow raincoat lurking about! Has he somehow returned to torment her? This would be quite odd since we learn that MILO drowned years earlier! Oh no! Claire's childhood friends start dying in horrible, bloody ways! Yep, it appears that MILO is back from the grave, intent on killing those who were there all those years ago! MILO is a somewhat macabre, yet ultimately silly movie. I'm not sure if the filmmakers were going for a DON'T LOOK NOW / THE BROOD thing w/ the raincoat, but it comes off as more humorous than frightening. MILO just isn't all that intimidating! It doesn't help that his voice sounds like Bugs Bunny on helium! Claire's increasing neurosis is rather comical as well. She comes across as delirious from the beginning. Antonio Fargas co-stars as the world's most unlucky janitor. His death at the tiny hands of MILO is brilliant in its absurdity! The head-bashing, utterly bananas, Claire vs. MILO finale (almost) makes up for the rest of the movie. It's hard to top a woman in half a wedding dress swinging a baseball bat at a mutant child armed w/ a scalpel! This movie misses being an all-out laugh riot due to its abortion-gone-mad subplot, and overall tedium.

447970,A22IK3I6U76GX0,6305086737,Calle,"[5, 7]","A young boy, Milo, kills a girl and stabs her friends. Sixteen years later, one of the girls, Claire, returns to the town to attend her friend's wedding. But when she arrives she learns the friend died in a car accident the day before. Claire takes over the friend's teaching job and soon she starts to see a boy who looks just like Milo.This is the standard slasher movie plot but the movie is somewhat different. First of all, it has less main characters than most slashers, which makes you care more for them, and especially the heroine, Claire. On the other hand, less characters mean less opportunities to kill them. The result is a horror movie that is more of a mystery than a gory slasher.The movie is director Pascal Franchot's first, and so far only moviem and some scenes could have been better made, but overall this is a good debut.In my opinion, this is better than the standard slasher because the plot is more interesting and the characters are better than in many slashers and easier to care for. The last fifteen or twenty minutes aren't quite as good as the rest of the movie, but still not bad. If you're looking for a mystery-horror movie, give this a try! If you want a slahser with as many killings as possible, there are other movies that would be better.",3,Underrated mystery-horror.,1048377600,"03 23, 2003",2003,1279,"['young', 'boy', 'Milo', 'girl', 'stabs', 'friends', 'Sixteen', 'years', 'later', 'one', 'girls', 'Claire', 'town', 'attend', 'friend', 'wedding', 'when', 'friend', 'died', 'car', 'accident', 'day', 'Claire', 'friend', 'teaching', 'job', 'soon', 'see', 'boy', 'who', 'just', 'Milo.This', 'standard', 'slasher', 'movie', 'plot', 'movie', 'somewhat', 'different', 'First', 'all', 'less', 'main', 'characters', 'most', 'slashers', 'care', 'more', 'especially', 'heroine', 'Claire', 'other', 'hand', 'less', 'characters', 'mean', 'less', 'opportunities', 'kill', 'result', 'horror', 'movie', 'more', 'mystery', 'gory', 'slasher.The', 'movie', 'director', 'Pascal', 'Franchot', 'first', 'so', 'far', 'only', 'moviem', 'scenes', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'made', 'overall', 'good', 'debut.In', 'opinion', 'better', 'standard', 'slasher', 'plot', 'more', 'interesting', 'characters', 'are', 'better', 'many', 'slashers', 'easier', 'care', 'last', 'fifteen', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'are', ""n't"", 'quite', 'as', 'good', 'rest', 'movie', 'still', 'not', 'bad', ""'re"", 'looking', 'mystery-horror', 'movie', 'give', 'try', 'want', 'slahser', 'many', 'killings', 'possible', 'are', 'other', 'movies', 'would', 'be', 'better']",Milo

It's plot is stupid, it is very pretictable, the acting sucks, and the ending is the worst ending for a movie I've seen in years.

This movie isn't even good enough to rent, even for free.  Spend your money on something else, don't go near this movie.  Please, please don't tell me they'll make a sequel, that will make this movie look even worse, cause I doubt they could make a sequel that was better than this horrible movie.
