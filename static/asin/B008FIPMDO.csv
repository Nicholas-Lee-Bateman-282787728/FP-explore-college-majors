I don't mind Strawberry Shortcake and friends, because it has good values and the dolls/cartoons are not over-sexualized.  This DVD has about four or five episodes--and it has auto-play as well, which is nice if you watch in the car.  (We bought it for a 4 hour drive.)  The first episode introduces you to Cherry Jam whose ""real-life"" persona is quite different from the one her PR time projects to the world.  Cherry just wants to be treated like a normal girl, not a superstar.  Another episode features Raspberry (Ra-Ra-Raspberry) being ""discovered"" and being offered a chance to be a big time fashion designer in Berry Big City.  I can't remember the other episodes, but they're all good.My daughter (and even her brothers) love this DVD.  I don't mind having it on in the background either.
