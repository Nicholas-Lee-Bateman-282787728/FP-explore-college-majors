984466,A2JHYW5V7UFIQ2,B000F7CMPE,,"[3, 3]","The pity of this series is that it was short-lived.  Still, 27 episodes isn't a bad run.The Adventures of Brisco County Jr. is a western series with a lot of humor, bizarre characters, and several bits of science fiction.  If this mix sounds familiar, think ""Wild, Wild West"".  However, this isn't just an imitation.Brisco County Jr. is the son of Brisco County Sr., one of the great bounty hunters of the western territories toward the end of the 19th Century.  Sr. is killed by the Bly Gang and Jr. (also an accomplished bounty hunter) swears revenge.  (Sr. later shows up later, at least once, as a ghost.)  Aside from the Bly gang, Brisco has a number of shoot-ups with the Swill brothers (Will, Phil, Bill, Gil, and Ed) - not to mention the Swill sister (Lil) - and of course the Swill mother (Ma).  His companion through all this (first a rival bounty hunter and later a partner) is Lord Bowler.  On occasion there are encounters with yet another bounty hunter, Dixie Cousins.  There are also regular appearances by Briso's main contact with his employers (some western robber barons), Socrates Poole.  Special mechanical needs in several episodes are met by Professor Albert Wickwire.  And then of course there's Comet the Wonder Horse.One of the reasons this series works is its casting.  Brisco is played by the veteran actor Bruce Campbell.  Campbell, who is vastly underrated (perhaps because he doesn't get asked to do Shakespeare or Scorsese), has before the age of 50 appeared in 92 films and TV series, produced 16, directed 7, written 3, and done just about everything else in film except sell the tickets.  He brings to his role here a professional and keenly calculated sense of timing and of humor - not to mention very athletic performances.Brisco's partner, Lord Bowler, is played by the accomplished Julius Carry.  Barely over 50, Carry has appeared in 58 films and TV series (mostly the latter).  His performance here is characterized by athleticism, bluster, humor, and authority.  In addition to Carry's star turn, the producers of the series have regularly cast black actors in roles not tailored to nor requiring African-American actors.  For a long time after black actors began to appear in mainstream films, they only got roles specifically race-oriented.  It's Hollywood's great strength that they have done a lot toward moving away from that sort of pseudo Jim Crowism.Third in the series' trilogy of stars, playing Socrates Poole, is the delightful and talented Christian Clemenson.  Not yet 50, Clemenson has appeared in 60 films and TV series.  He's currently doing a bang-up job in ""Boston Legal"" as the socially handicapped Jerry Espenson.  As Poole, he's an Eastern tinhorn who's not doing a bad job of adapting to the rough-and-tumble of the Old West.Other actors in smaller roles are talented and believable.  As Professor Wickwire is the fabulous John Astin, whose 140 acting credits include various stints as Gomez Addams and Professor Gangreen (you know, the Killer Tomato movies).  All of the people appearing here are a pleasure to watch; not a dud in the bunch.  Billy Drago is outstanding as the crazed John Bly and manages to look every inch the psychopath Bly is.  Drago is a well-represented film veteran, with 90 films (including some TV work) to his credit.The various episodes are well plotted, full of action and humor, witty lines, good character byplay, and the Orb.  The Orb (of which there are 3, although 1 is destroyed early in the series and another vanishes into the future) is an extraterrestrial spherical device consisting of a number of blue rods each with a gold end.  The Orb has a number of interesting powers and can also confer powers and abilities.  The attempts by Bly to get an Orb for himself and the efforts of Brisco to prevent this form the backdrop of many episodes.The production values of this series are very high.  Scenery, sets, costumes, livestock ... everything is exactly as it should be.  Photography is clear and colorful.  Most episodes are about 44 minutes; the pilot is 2 hours.  The last 2 episodes constitute a 2-part series cap.  The scripts display a good deal of originality, if one credits the amount the series owes to its predecessors.  I'm not a big fan of westerns in general because of their predictability.  ""Wild, Wild West"" (the series and the film) is of course an exception, and so is the Brisco County Jr. series.  I highly, highly recommend you get this set.  It's 22  hours of pure entertainment.",5,A single word:  Wow!,1206057600,"03 21, 2008",2008,4507,"['pity', 'series', 'was', 'short-lived', 'Still', '27', 'episodes', ""n't"", 'bad', 'run.The', 'Adventures', 'Brisco', 'County', 'Jr.', 'western', 'series', 'lot', 'humor', 'bizarre', 'characters', 'several', 'bits', 'science', 'fiction', 'mix', 'familiar', 'think', 'Wild', 'Wild', 'West', 'However', ""n't"", 'just', 'imitation.Brisco', 'County', 'Jr.', 'son', 'Brisco', 'County', 'Sr.', 'one', 'great', 'bounty', 'hunters', 'western', 'territories', 'end', '19th', 'Century', 'Sr.', 'killed', 'Bly', 'Gang', 'Jr.', 'also', 'accomplished', 'bounty', 'hunter', 'revenge', 'Sr.', 'later', 'up', 'later', 'least', 'once', 'ghost', 'Aside', 'Bly', 'gang', 'Brisco', 'number', 'shoot-ups', 'Swill', 'brothers', 'Will', 'Phil', 'Bill', 'Gil', 'Ed', 'not', 'mention', 'Swill', 'sister', 'Lil', 'course', 'Swill', 'mother', 'Ma', 'companion', 'first', 'rival', 'bounty', 'hunter', 'later', 'partner', 'Lord', 'Bowler', 'occasion', 'are', 'encounters', 'yet', 'bounty', 'hunter', 'Dixie', 'Cousins', 'are', 'also', 'regular', 'appearances', 'Briso', 'main', 'contact', 'employers', 'western', 'robber', 'barons', 'Socrates', 'Poole', 'Special', 'mechanical', 'needs', 'several', 'episodes', 'are', 'met', 'Professor', 'Albert', 'Wickwire', 'then', 'course', 'Comet', 'Wonder', 'Horse.One', 'reasons', 'series', 'casting', 'Brisco', 'played', 'veteran', 'actor', 'Bruce', 'Campbell', 'Campbell', 'who', 'vastly', 'underrated', 'perhaps', ""n't"", 'get', 'asked', 'do', 'Shakespeare', 'Scorsese', 'age', '50', 'appeared', '92', 'films', 'TV', 'series', 'produced', '16', 'directed', '7', 'written', '3', 'done', 'just', 'everything', 'else', 'film', 'sell', 'tickets', 'role', 'here', 'professional', 'keenly', 'calculated', 'sense', 'timing', 'humor', 'not', 'mention', 'very', 'athletic', 'performances.Brisco', 'partner', 'Lord', 'Bowler', 'played', 'accomplished', 'Julius', 'Carry', 'Barely', '50', 'Carry', 'appeared', '58', 'films', 'TV', 'series', 'mostly', 'latter', 'performance', 'here', 'characterized', 'athleticism', 'bluster', 'humor', 'authority', 'addition', 'Carry', 'star', 'turn', 'producers', 'series', 'have', 'regularly', 'cast', 'black', 'actors', 'roles', 'not', 'tailored', 'requiring', 'African-American', 'actors', 'long', 'time', 'black', 'actors', 'began', 'appear', 'mainstream', 'films', 'only', 'got', 'roles', 'specifically', 'race-oriented', 'Hollywood', 'great', 'strength', 'have', 'done', 'lot', 'moving', 'away', 'sort', 'pseudo', 'Jim', 'Crowism.Third', 'series', 'trilogy', 'stars', 'playing', 'Socrates', 'Poole', 'delightful', 'talented', 'Christian', 'Clemenson', 'Not', 'yet', '50', 'Clemenson', 'appeared', '60', 'films', 'TV', 'series', 'currently', 'doing', 'bang-up', 'job', 'Boston', 'Legal', 'socially', 'handicapped', 'Jerry', 'Espenson', 'Poole', 'Eastern', 'tinhorn', 'who', 'not', 'doing', 'bad', 'job', 'adapting', 'rough-and-tumble', 'Old', 'West.Other', 'actors', 'smaller', 'roles', 'are', 'talented', 'believable', 'Professor', 'Wickwire', 'fabulous', 'John', 'Astin', '140', 'acting', 'credits', 'include', 'various', 'stints', 'Gomez', 'Addams', 'Professor', 'Gangreen', 'know', 'Killer', 'Tomato', 'movies', 'people', 'appearing', 'here', 'are', 'pleasure', 'watch', 'not', 'dud', 'bunch', 'Billy', 'Drago', 'outstanding', 'crazed', 'John', 'Bly', 'look', 'inch', 'psychopath', 'Bly', 'Drago', 'well-represented', 'film', 'veteran', '90', 'films', 'including', 'TV', 'work', 'credit.The', 'various', 'episodes', 'are', 'well', 'plotted', 'full', 'action', 'humor', 'witty', 'lines', 'good', 'character', 'byplay', 'Orb', 'Orb', 'are', '3', '1', 'destroyed', 'early', 'series', 'vanishes', 'future', 'extraterrestrial', 'spherical', 'device', 'consisting', 'number', 'blue', 'rods', 'gold', 'end', 'Orb', 'number', 'interesting', 'powers', 'can', 'also', 'confer', 'powers', 'abilities', 'attempts', 'Bly', 'get', 'Orb', 'efforts', 'Brisco', 'prevent', 'form', 'backdrop', 'many', 'episodes.The', 'production', 'values', 'series', 'are', 'very', 'high', 'Scenery', 'sets', 'costumes', 'livestock', 'everything', 'exactly', 'should', 'be', 'Photography', 'clear', 'colorful', 'Most', 'episodes', 'are', '44', 'minutes', 'pilot', '2', 'hours', 'last', '2', 'episodes', 'constitute', '2-part', 'series', 'cap', 'scripts', 'display', 'good', 'deal', 'originality', 'one', 'amount', 'series', 'predecessors', ""'m"", 'not', 'big', 'fan', 'westerns', 'general', 'predictability', 'Wild', 'Wild', 'West', 'series', 'film', 'course', 'exception', 'so', 'Brisco', 'County', 'Jr.', 'series', 'highly', 'highly', 'recommend', 'get', 'set', '22', 'hours', 'pure', 'entertainment']",N/A

All of the characters really are Characters with a capital ""C"". I'm especially a sucker for shows which defy genre limits. Yes, it's a western, but it's also great science fiction and a marvelous comedy. There are more puns and anachronisms per minute of airtime than just about any other show ever made. It recalls the earlier ""Wild Wild West"" but takes itself less seriously, which actually helps the viewer suspend disbelief to the extent needed to enjoy the show.The cast is great. Bruce Campbell (Briscoe) is in a class by himself in creating cult heroes. Julius Carry (Lord Bowler) is superb as his anti-sidekick. Billy Drago (John Bly) is a suitably malevolent arch villain. Kelley Rutherford (Dixie) is Briscoe's erstwhile love interest - a bad girl with a heart of gold. Ms. Rutherford plays Dixie as Mae West and nails it. John Pyper-Ferguson (Pete) is hilarious as the OCD member of Bly's gang. Christian Clemenson and John Astin are also regulars who wear their eccentric roles like their own skin.

Throughout the arc, there is a mysterious object called the Orb which has what appear to be magical powers.

Although the show only lasted a season, it left an indelible mark in the memories of its fans. In a way, the overall story arc could easily remind you of some of the more ""out there"" episodes of ""The Wild, Wild West"".Briscoe seeks the man who murdered his father, a famous Western lawman. He is helped in his adventures by a very large bounty hunter (Lord Bowler), a wimpy lawyer, and an eccentric inventor and the inventor's daughter. We get a fond look at John Astin in the role of the inventor. Of course no cowboy hero is complete without a brilliant steed, and Briscoe is not left out in the cold in that regard either! LOLThere are myriad comic moments, some very high brow, as when two villainous henchmen have an existential discussion about art while painting a picture of a train tunnel on a boulder blocking the tracks. LOLBilly Drago plays the main villain being chased by Briscoe with a smarmy evil charm that is unforgettable. (Many may actually know this actor's son better ... Ed on Northern Exposure).Briscoe himself is played by the ever entertaining Bruce Campbell. Bruce was at the height of his popularity when he starred in this series. Handsome, heroic, and witty, he was as charming in this role as all his others. Gary Hudson appeared in three episodes as a character we fondly called ""The Elvis Sheriff"".There may have been only one season, but it comprised 27 shows, and thankfully wrapped up its season long story arc at the end. So don't think of it as a short TV series, think of it instead as a VERY long mini-series.

It's a good, clean (mostly) action-adventure show with some great comedy and great characters. And it's for most ages - like an old-time cowboy serial.The story follows Brisco County Jr. (Campbell), a lawyer who turns bounty hunter when his father, a famed lawman, is gunned down in cold blood by the criminal gang of the infamous John Bly. Aided by his friends, the grumpy scout and tracker Lord Bowler (Julius Carry), cowardly Socrates Poole (Christian Celmenson), and Prof. Wiskwire (John Astin, who you may remember as Gomez Addams from the original Addams Family), Brisco is hired by a group of tycoons to bring Bly ot justice. In the process, Brisco becomes embroiled in the search for the mysterious and mystical Orb, an object of enormous occult power coveted by Bly. Along they way, Brisco has run-ins with the seductive chanteuse Dixie Cousins (Kelly Rutherford) and Bly's wacky henchmen.What marks this show is its sense of fun. There are crazy inventions, weird villains (including a prairie pirate named - I kid you not - Blackbeard LeCut), cliffhangers, and everything else that makes adventure shows a great time. The jokes and puns come hard and fast, and the characters are nothing if not lovable - even Comet, Brisco's ""talking"" horse. Now, the whole science fiction element that is woven throughout the show is a little off-putting - it just doesn't seem to quite fit - but it doesn't detract too much from the program over all.

Hornaday,"[347, 354]","Few DVD releases will generate the excitement among fans that this boxed set will, and for good reason: The Adventures of Brisco County, Jr., is arguably one of the best TV shows of ANY genre to have been produced in the past 20 years. (As its tag line promised, ""Smile. You're about to meet your new hero."")Not only does this box set include pristine transfers of the entire series (comprised of 27 episodes which aired on Fox from Aug. 27, 1993-May 20, 1994), it also boasts an in-depth feature interview with star and cultural icon Bruce (Army of Darkness) Campbell, who supported this DVD release in every way.In addition, the studio has announced these great ""extras"" include Brisco's Book of Coming Things; A Brisco County Writer's Room, a write-em cowboy reunion; History of Brisco County Documentary; A Reading from the Book of Bruce; and Tools of the Trade, an interactive gadets gallery.Kudos to Fox Studios for getting it right! (Note: while the individual episodes have been available for sometime on VHS, this is the first time the series has been released on DVD, and the first time the show has been released in a single boxed set in any format.)While the series is clearly a western, it truly defies classification because it incorporates many different and unexpected elements including science fiction, time travel, ghosts, the supernatural, comedy, amazing gadgetry and core morality issues that make it a truly unique and unforgettable viewing experience.In the pilot, the saga begins simply enough when, ""one of the greatest lawmen the West has ever known,"" U.S. Marshal Brisco County, Sr., (played by R. Lee Ermey) is on a train with other lawmen transporting outlaw John Bly and his evil Gang of 12, whom he had captured, to face justice. But, the tables are abruptly turned when the prisoners are freed and the Marshal is killed by Bly.The Marshal's son, Brisco County, Jr., a Harvard graduate who earned a law degree, is hired as an unlikely bounty hunter by the members of San Francisco's Westerfield Club to track the outlaws down. Brisco straps on his father's gunbelt with its famed ivory-handled six-shooter, which he handles better than a western trick star, and never looks back.Brisco, ably assisted by Comet the Wonder Horse (who has more intelligence than most people), meets a variety of friends and foes as he pursues his goal and also stumbles onto an incredible legend: the tale of a supernatural golden glowing orb that bestows unimaginable powers on the person who possesses it. Brisco soon realizes that Bly will stop at nothing to obtain the orb and wield it for his own diabolical purpose.Campbell, who is perfectly cast, brought a warm, human depth to the character along with an inside wink to the audience underscoring life's absurdities. He also gave deadpan deliveries of puns laced with sexual and non-sexual overtones.The primary cast includes Julius J. Carry III as James ""Lord Bowler"" Lonefeather, a rival bounty hunter packing a sawed-off shotgun strapped to his back who eventually became Brisco's best friend and ""side-kick""; Christian Clemnson as Socrates Poole, the straight-laced Westerfield Club attorney befriended by Brisco and Bowler; Kelly Rutherford as Dixie Cousins, dance hall singer and Brisco's love interest; John Pyper-Ferguson as bungling outlaw Pete Hutter, in love with his six-shooter; John (Addams Family) Astin as brilliant, eccentric inventor Professor Albert Wickwire; and Billy Drago as the infamous Bly. There are also great and unexpected guest stars throughout including Terry Bradshaw, Sheena Easton, and Timothy Leary.In addition to the two-hour pilot, episodes are: The Orb Scholar; No Man's Land; Brisco in Jalisco; Socrates' Sister; Riverboat; Pirates; Senior Spirit; Brisco for the Defense; Showdown; Deep in the Heart of Dixie; Crystal Hawkes; Steel Horses; Mail Order Brides; A.K.A. Kansas; Bounty Hunter's Convention; Fountain of Youth; Hard Rock; Brooklyn Dodgers; 'Bye Bly; Ned Zed; Stagecoach; Wild Card; And Baby Makes Three; Bad Luck Betty; High Treason Part I; and High

Scuttlebut had it that BCJ got shelved in the Friday night slot (the 'death slot'-when people go out and don't watch TV)and was just a victim of later lame ratings; but the truth is that the show was way ahead of its time both for producers and audiences alike, and they didn't realize what they had! The odd thing about television and movie productions is that the studio, producers, director, crew and cast don't know if they have a winner until 'it's in the can' and been through a test audience. Considering it takes close to two hundred humans to make a film, the odds of any one thing not working and taking the whole production down with it are extreme! Present TV shows are excellent  examples of 'what doesn't work!' The magic word is 'formula.' Every show needs a formula and this either works or it doesn't. BCJ had not only a working formula, but a terrific formula. The show had humor, romance, drama, comedy, western skills, new inventions and a touch of sci-fi. Not bad for a western, which could have been mundane. This show had terrific writers, professional direction,outstanding casting and terrific acting! Each show was written as a serial, with a cliff-hanger at the end; as early serials were  written in the 30's and 40's. And each script covered a different subject, so that audiences were never bored. This is a terrific set on 8 DVDs and provides hours of entertainment and has a special features disc, which explains a lot. It also goes to show you that production companies rarely make the right decisions as to what the public wants to watch.

My few clear memories of the show include Brisco, Bowler, quicksand, trains and motorcycles.  After the show disappeared from the Fox network, I sorely missed it, though I occasionally caught it on a cable TV station in later years every once and a while, it wasn't long before I would forget about the show (and even its name) until only a few years ago.Around the age of 15, I became a HUGE horror movie fan.  Now naturally, I stumbled upon The Evil Dead Trilogy and the King of B Movies, Bruce Campbell.  After a visit to the man's website to see what else he had been a part of, I saw a picture of Bowler and Brisco.  My eyes skimmed across the picture and then did a double take.  ""Is that?  It is!!  He was in that show!?!?  He was BRISCO?!""  I was astonished.  Childhood memories flooded back to my mind of me sitting around the TV with my family and watching Bruce Campbell fight the bad guys.  Brisco's face had faded from my memory, which was why I didn't recognize Bruce Campbell when I watched the Evil Dead films.It was only a few months after my rediscovery of the show that I heard it was going to be released on DVD and I immediately found myself jumping with joy.  To me, Brisco wasn't just any ordinary TV show.  This was part of my childhood.  This was the opportunity to take a trip back to when things were simple.  This was personal.  I needed to see this show again.  And now knowing that Bruce Campbell (the star of movies like the Evil Dead Trilogy and Bubba Ho-Tep) made me even more eager to see this show again.Finally around the holidays, I got my hands on a copy of the show due to the price dropping from holiday sales.  The show was as every bit as entertaining as I remembered it to be.  For those who haven't seen Brisco before, it's well, Chessy!  But it's cheesy in a good way.  The Bruce Campbell way!  If you're a Bruce Campbell fan, you'll love it no matter what so just go get a copy.  For those who are new to the guy, check out his other works like Evil Dead and Bubba Ho-Tep and then come back here.  You'll enjoy it more in the long run!As for the packaging, it's good.  Though I'm surprised that Warner Brothers couldn't fit the show on less than EIGHT discs resulting in a rather expensive DVD set.  However, with a set like this, there are bound to be a few copies with loose discs.  If you decide to buy this at a store (in which case it will probably be more expensive) give the box a shake to make sure there are not any loose discs (which result in scratches).  Mine from Amazon arrived in perfect condition but when ordering online, there is the risk that a disc or two could be busted loose as well, but that is the risk that you have to take sometimes.  Other than the fact that the show is EIGHT discs and that the consumer can run the risk of getting a scratched disc(s), the packaging is nicely done.Once a Bruce Campbell fan, always a Bruce Campbell fan.  You fall in love with the man's style once you are integrated into the world of B Movies, no one else can replicate it.  It's truly unique and that's why horror fans and B movie lovers will always place Bruce Campbell amongst the throne of them all.",5,I Was A Bruce Campbell Fan Before I Even Knew It!,1184198400,"07 12, 2007",2007,3443,"['grandmother', 'watched', 'Dr.', 'Quinn', 'Medicine', 'Woman', 'My', 'family', 'would', 'occasionally', 'watch', 'Adventures', 'Brisco', 'Country', 'Jr', 'years', 'shows', 'airing', '94', 'was', 'only', 'age', '5', '6', 'so', 'naturally', 'memory', 'show', 'blur', 'quite', 'tad', 'fuzzy', 'few', 'clear', 'memories', 'show', 'include', 'Brisco', 'Bowler', 'quicksand', 'trains', 'motorcycles', 'show', 'disappeared', 'Fox', 'network', 'sorely', 'missed', 'occasionally', 'caught', 'cable', 'TV', 'station', 'later', 'years', 'once', 'while', 'was', ""n't"", 'long', 'would', 'forget', 'show', 'even', 'name', 'only', 'few', 'years', 'age', '15', 'became', 'HUGE', 'horror', 'movie', 'fan', 'Now', 'naturally', 'stumbled', 'Evil', 'Dead', 'Trilogy', 'King', 'B', 'Movies', 'Bruce', 'Campbell', 'visit', 'man', 'website', 'see', 'what', 'else', 'had', 'been', 'part', 'saw', 'picture', 'Bowler', 'Brisco', 'eyes', 'skimmed', 'picture', 'then', 'did', 'double', 'take', 'was', 'show', 'was', 'BRISCO', 'was', 'astonished', 'Childhood', 'memories', 'flooded', 'back', 'mind', 'sitting', 'TV', 'family', 'watching', 'Bruce', 'Campbell', 'fight', 'bad', 'guys', 'Brisco', 'face', 'had', 'faded', 'memory', 'was', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'recognize', 'Bruce', 'Campbell', 'when', 'watched', 'Evil', 'Dead', 'films.It', 'was', 'only', 'few', 'months', 'rediscovery', 'show', 'heard', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'released', 'DVD', 'immediately', 'found', 'jumping', 'joy', 'Brisco', 'was', ""n't"", 'just', 'ordinary', 'TV', 'show', 'was', 'part', 'childhood', 'was', 'opportunity', 'take', 'trip', 'back', 'when', 'things', 'were', 'simple', 'was', 'personal', 'needed', 'see', 'show', 'again', 'now', 'knowing', 'Bruce', 'Campbell', 'star', 'movies', 'Evil', 'Dead', 'Trilogy', 'Bubba', 'Ho-Tep', 'made', 'even', 'more', 'eager', 'see', 'show', 'again.Finally', 'holidays', 'got', 'hands', 'copy', 'show', 'due', 'price', 'dropping', 'holiday', 'sales', 'show', 'was', 'bit', 'as', 'entertaining', 'remembered', 'be', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Brisco', 'well', 'Chessy', 'cheesy', 'good', 'way', 'Bruce', 'Campbell', 'way', ""'re"", 'Bruce', 'Campbell', 'fan', ""'ll"", 'love', 'matter', 'what', 'so', 'just', 'go', 'get', 'copy', 'who', 'are', 'new', 'guy', 'check', 'out', 'other', 'works', 'Evil', 'Dead', 'Bubba', 'Ho-Tep', 'then', 'come', 'back', 'here', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'more', 'long', 'run', 'packaging', 'good', ""'m"", 'surprised', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'could', ""n't"", 'fit', 'show', 'less', 'EIGHT', 'discs', 'resulting', 'rather', 'expensive', 'DVD', 'set', 'However', 'set', 'are', 'bound', 'be', 'few', 'copies', 'loose', 'discs', 'decide', 'buy', 'store', 'case', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'more', 'expensive', 'give', 'box', 'shake', 'make', 'sure', 'are', 'not', 'loose', 'discs', 'result', 'scratches', 'Mine', 'Amazon', 'arrived', 'perfect', 'condition', 'when', 'ordering', 'online', 'risk', 'disc', 'two', 'could', 'be', 'busted', 'loose', 'as', 'well', 'risk', 'have', 'take', 'sometimes', 'Other', 'fact', 'show', 'EIGHT', 'discs', 'consumer', 'can', 'run', 'risk', 'getting', 'scratched', 'disc', 's', 'packaging', 'nicely', 'done.Once', 'Bruce', 'Campbell', 'fan', 'always', 'Bruce', 'Campbell', 'fan', 'fall', 'love', 'man', 'style', 'are', 'integrated', 'world', 'B', 'Movies', 'one', 'else', 'can', 'replicate', 'truly', 'unique', 'why', 'horror', 'fans', 'B', 'movie', 'lovers', 'will', 'always', 'place', 'Bruce', 'Campbell', 'throne']",N/A

Cripe ""cooncat3""","[2, 3]","No need to reiterate all the praise this series has gotten -- but I heartily agree with all the superlatives.I never saw this series on TV but heard a lot about it, and after reading many of the reviews here and talking to friends, I took a chance and bought it. No regrets whatever! I had seen Bruce Campbell as Autolycus in Hercules and in several other things and I have concluded that the reason he is not a ""big star"" by industry standards is that the quality of his work is too far above the mediocrity of most TV and movies. He has it all, particularly intelligence as well as acting ability and good looks.This is also a great ensemble show, with some of the weirdest and most wondeful heros and villains you'll ever see, all over the place. Lord Bowler is much more than just a sidekick and is a standout in the ensemble. Dixie Cousins makes the inevitable procession of guest blondes look pretty sick. Pete Hutter is simply hilarious -- please don't part him from his ""piece""! John Bly is one of the spookiest villains ever. And while we're at it, let's give a couple of bushels of green apples to Comet, who doesn't know he's a horse and is smarter than most of today's TV icons.I personally think the orb is something Dr. Who lost out of the Tardis -- pretty cool of him to send a naked time traveler to fetch it. On the other hand, maybe the Vorlons sent it.For all those people complaining about the cost of the set -- do your arithmetic. Have you been to a movie theater lately? How much did you spend for movie tickets and concessions for something you watched only once, probably in a scruffy theater which hadn't been cleaned since last year (if then), and surrounded by rude people talking out loud and stomping back and forth over your feet (which were probably stuck to the crud on the floor)? For the price of the Brisco set I get to watch 8 DVDs (lots of hours) as many times as I want to, from the comfort of my living room couch (with cats and a pint of Ben & Jerry's).Finally, this is one of the few DVD sets where the ""extras"" are actually worth having because they are interesting and fun -- so many DVD extras are mushy filler or stupid interviews.",5,Wow!

984540,A27P0MW8TE1JQP,B000F7CMPE,Kevin J. Loria,"[75, 79]","The Adventures of Brisco County was one of the most creative productions on television. Each week, Brisco and his friends, the Mae West-like old flame Dixie Cousins (Kelly Rutherford), lawyer/ administrator Socrates Pool, the loyal and mad Prof. Wickwire (the brillant John ""Gomez"" Astin) and others take on the villains the ""Old West"" while keeping an eye on the future.  The Harvard-educated bounty hunter teams up with his rival Lord Bowler (Julius Carry, Sho `Nuff for THE LAST DRAGON) to capture the Bly gang responsible for his father's death and much more. It is this clever combination of classic action, a touch of sci-fi, and a good dose of humor that make the series unique (example: bad guys who paint tunnels on rocks like a train-robbing coyote). So, take a minute or two and slip back into the wild & weird days of the old west - where riding, shooting, and fighting was the measure of a man - that and a square jaw, a talking wonder horse and outlaws from the future. The series was also loaded the Bruce Campbell's quirky humor and full of great anachronistic goofs on ""coming things"" loads of modern ideas and concepts quickly dismissed by the cast as impossibly unrealistic for the future (like Drive Thru-dining or hamburgers a.k.a ""Cowpies"") The series was groundbreaking in a relatively unique TV genre, the ""Western-Indiana Jones-style-action-sci-fi-spoof"" (there was ""Best of the West"" an 80's sit-com western and ""The Wild, Wild West"").Here's the complete series episode breakdown, with some highlights:1.)The PILOTWhen U.S. Marshal Brisco County, Sr. is murdered by John Bly and his gang, the robber barons of San Francisco's Westerfield Club hire Brisco County, Jr. as a bounty hunter to round them up. Brisco meets a line-up unusual people along the way, including rival bounty hunter Lord Bowler, and the Westerfield Club's stuffy lawyer, Socrates Poole also Prof. Wickwire. He also learns of a mysterious ORB which John Bly (Billy Drago, reoccurring on Charmed) would do anything to possess, for the supernatural power it can give him.2.) The ORB SCHOLAROn X-Files, whic happen to run after Brisco, they had Mythos episodes that continue the continuity of the alien-cover-up storyline. In Brisco, episodes would spring up exploring the mystery of the ORB so desired by the murderer of Brisco County Sr. Here we learn more about the ORB, and of Brisco's destiny with it. Very good for such an early episode.3.) NO MAN'S LANDThis one has little ORB continuity, but it does have a town propulated only by women, the Schwenke Sisters, and Professor Wickwire.4.) BRISCO in JaliscoBrisco and Socrates head to Mexico to recover some stolen guns. Brisco is in for a shock when Pete Hutter turns up as the thief, trying to sell them to a crooked General.5.) SOCRATES' SISTER`Nuff said. Prof. Wickwire  invents his Amazing Innerspace Suit (a diver's suit) too.6.) RIVERBOATYep, you guessed it a gambling sting on riverboat. The invention of jeans, too.7.) PIRATES!Brisco & Bowler try to capture crazy land-pirate Blackbeard LaCutte, a wanted member of the Bly gang, who has stolen all of a town's supplies, including the medicine needed to save a sick boy (awe-say it ain't so).8.) SENIOR SPIRITMore Prof. Wickwire and the ghost of Brisco County Sr.9.) BRISCO FOR THE DEFENSEBrisco uses those lawyering skills we've heard so little about, to defend an old collage buddy.10.)ShowdownBrisco & Bowler head to Brisco's hometown, to help an old girlfriend and her sheriff father stop a town takeover.11.) DEEP in the HEART of DIXIEDixie and Brisco are on the run from a hitman and his gang. The superb David Warner makes a guest appearance.12.) CRYSTAL HAWKSEvery bounty hunter in the West is out for Brisco for a crime he didn't commit, lead by lady bounty hunter Crystal Hawks played by Sheena Easton. Bly is in this one too.13.) STEEL HORSESBrisco & Bowler try to capture Bly gang member Juno Dawkins, and recover the prototype motorcycles he's stolen to use to intercept a government wagon transporting the mysterious ORB.14.) MAIL ORDER BRIDESThe disturbing Swill Bros. have stolen the dowry of 3 mail order  brides.15.) A.K.A. KansasBrisco uses the alias of Kansas Wily Stafford, to infiltrate the ranks of an ex-Bly gang member and ex-husband of Dixie, with Dixie's help, ofcourse.16.) BOUNTY HUNTER's CONVENTIONThis is a take off of Agatha Christie's THE TEN LITTLE INDIANS. Its a mystery who-done-it in the classic sense, complete with an old hotel, thunderstorms, and secret passages.17.) FOUNTAIN OF YOUTHBrisco vs. the Best-looking gang he's ever seen, while we learn Bly's true origin and purpose.18.) HARD ROCKA great episode! We get to meet Sheriff Aaron Viva (one of the best characters in the series), an Elvis knock off (get it Aaron Viva) that can eat as well as he can ""use his stuff"" in hand to hand action, this is one of hundreds of pop culture and rock references. Whip Morgan also shows up for the first time.19.) The Brooklyn DODGERSBrisco and Bowler help kids get to San Francisco and fight off the Johnnies.20.) BYE BLYA woman from the future helps Brisco in his final confrontation with Bly and the origin of the ORBs. Sets of the future of the series giving Brisco and Bowler a mission from the President himself.21.) NED ZEDA run of the mill story is taking to another level by presenting the episode as a father and son reading a dime novel about Brisco and Bowler! Super!

The packaging is very well done also. The 10 discs are packaged in a connected 6 section fold-out package with two discs per section and a section with a pocket that holds a booklet with episode decsriptions including air dates; this entire package slips into an outer cardboard sleeve. The booklet is printed on hard stock paper and colorfully decorated with scenes of the characters and shots from the episodes, each disc also has a colorful scene printed on it as a background.I thoroughly enjoyed this series when it was on TV and was pleased to catch the few reruns when they we oh-so sporadically broadcast. Sure, it is a bit outlandish with the mysterious qualities of the ""Orb"" and a there are some fairly far-fetched basis' for some of the episodes such as the ""mobile battle wagon"" in the episode ""No Man's Land"", it's a 19th century version of an Army tank. And the inventions by John Astin's character are always a hoot. But, hey, that's what the whole series was about, wasn't it. Enough good action, the Good Guys win, some laughs and a few winks and none of the nudity or profanity which seems to be a requirement and mainstay of today's produced programs. It's great to make a bowl of popcorn and enjoy them with my grand kids without worrying about any inappropriate scenes or language popping up.One small criticism though, the sequence of the discs is just a tad out of order. The set has Episode #2 as ""Socrates' Sister"" - the ""Socrates' Sister"" episode is actually #5 in the sequence. But this is a minor, minor glitch in the overall quality of this set. Wikipedia has some good info on the series that I printed out as an extra for myself.

There was a definite and oddly not out of place sci-fi twist to it, with Brisco perpetually in search of ""the coming thing"", his unspecific term for the new technology that he believes will come with the advent of the 20th century. The sub-plot revolving around ""the orb"", a semi-mad Professor Wickwire whose invention skills are questionable, zeppelins, pirates, and lots of little nods to future inventions/intentional anachronisms all made for a series that was sort of lightly steampunk, well before the sub-genre gained any semblance of popularity. Indeed, Brisco was in many ways ahead of his time.Actual plot and the unusually clever deadpan humor aside, this was a character driven series, and what an interesting lot they were. Brisco, the son of a lawman gunned down during a train robbery, is enlisted by the government (represented by one Socrates Poole, who becomes the lovable side kick) to track down the gang who murdered him. This leads us to John Bly, whose gang is possibly the most inept in the west, but Billy Drago plays the part of sinister lurking evil to perfection, without taking it over the top. Dixie Cousins, the almost-but-not-quite love interest was equal parts wit and girl next door who happens to occasionally work in a dubious profession.There is Comet the wonder horse, who is engaged in an unspoken dispute with Brisco's rival, Lord Bowler, an antagonist who eventually warms up to Brisco but whose loyalties are still debatable. And possibly the most colorful of the cast is Professor Wickwire, an inventor who would be ahead of his time if only most of his gadgets would function properly.Action, adventure, sci-fi and a touch of droll comedy all come together perfectly to make this a lighthearted, witty series appropriate for the entire family. It is good (mostly) clean fun that actually entertains. Brisco County Jr. was one of a kind twenty years ago, and now that the intelligence of television has taken a permanent downhill tumble, I doubt there ever will be anything like it again.",5,When The Wild West Meets Sci-Fi...

It is extremely rare to find a series, where almost every episode is a five, but this one does it!Besides the large number of high ratings given this series, another tipoff that this is a great series, is found in one of the special features, when the actress, who plays the curvaceous and seductive Dixie Cousins, says, ""Just brilliant!  You read the scripts, and go: 'Oh! My! God!' ... I can't wait to do this! ... I can't wait to say that line!""  ( Once before, I have come across a similar compliment given by actor Jack Klugman when talking about Rod Serling's scripts for the great ""Twilight Zone"" series; that should tell you something about the quality of ""The Adventures of Brisco County, Jr."")This series is memorable; after you have watched it, you probably will not forget ""The Orbs.""  They appear in only eight of the episodes, but the mystery surrounding them will stay with you.  Why?  Although the story of the orbs appears to end in the episode ""Bye Bly"", the background story for the orbs is far from complete.The orbs have many capabilities, one of which is time travel, however it is not the only means of time travel.  One night a beautiful lady arrives in Brisco's room sans time machine and sans clothing!

984558,ATP9LYGM6D3RO,B000F7CMPE,"McGillicutty ""DVD Fan""","[1, 1]","""The Adventures of Brisco County, Jr."" was one of the most entertaining and unusual shows to ever air on Fox or any other network for that matter. Led by the always affable Bruce Campbell, ""The Adventures of Brisco County, Jr."" was a highly entertaining western-adventure-comedy-sci fi series that borrowed elements from many different sources, such as 1930's serials with cliffhangers, ""Mavarick"", ""Gunsmoke"", ""The Wild Wild West"", and science fiction elements as well that focus mostly on the mysterious ""Orb"" which was introduced in the pilot episode.Another unusual element was that the show only lasted one season, yet had a large 27 episode order which meant that at some point Fox, the network where the show aired had a great deal of faith in it, yet that disappeared at some point since they rather quickly renewed another show from that time, ""The X Files"". Why ""Brisco"" was cancelled is not very well explained, even in the DVD extras although I would have to figure that the sheer cost of producing a period television show in Hollywood played a role with the ratings not being very good.As for us, we are left with 27 highly entertaining episodes that feature a wide range of characters, situations, action and adventure along with some good comedic moments as well. The focus of the season was Brisco tracking down the Bly Gang who killed his father (played ably by R. Lee Ermey). Brisco is hired by a group of wealthy men to find the gang and many of the episodes center on his bringing to justice each gang member. However, there are also other run-ins that Brisco has along the way.Bruce Campbell is simply perfect as Brisco County, Jr., bringing with him his sharp wit, good looks and dry sense of humor. He is ably supported in the series by Christian Clemenson as Socrates Poole, Brisco's go-between with the wealthy group, Julius Carry who plays Lord Bowler, a rival bounty hunter who rather quickly becomes Brisco's friend and partner, and Kelly Rutherford as Dixie Cousins, Brisco's would-be love that manages to heat up the screen quite easily and has a wonderful rapport with Campbell.Others worthy of mention are Billy Drago who plays Bly, the leader of the gang,  John Astin, as crazy as ever playing Dr. Wickwire who invents all sorts of contraptions, John Pyper-Ferguson as Pete, a notorious outlaw whose piece you do not touch and Comet, Brisco's horse who is arguably the smartest character in the series.Virtually all the episodes are excellently produced, well-written and wonderfully entertaining so much so that it is difficult to choose the ""better"" ones, although the pilot episode is very good. ""No Man's Land"" which introduces us to the unforgettable Swill Brothers and the Schwenke Sisters, ""Riverboat"" which feels like an old episode of ""Maverick"", and the two-part finale ""High Treason"" with Terry Bradshaw (yes, that Terry Bradshaw) playing the bad guy.If I had a bone to pick, it would be about the sci-fi elements surrounding the ""Orb"" a mysterious object that may or may not be from the future which seemed to have powers of whatever was required from the script that week. However, the show did manage to effectively tweek many of the conventions of today with sly references that are very funny and helped keep the series fresh. If I have a single favorite scene, it would be the freeing of Brisco and others from a large safe by...well, let's just say he's even smarter than you might think...and Campbell's line just after they discover who their benefactor is after their release is one for the ages.The DVD package itself is really nice, although one of the disc holders had lost a few of the holding pieces which means it slides around inside. Still, this series does come with plenty of good extras including the following;- A booklet with episode recaps written by none other than Bruce Campbell himself- ""Brisco's Book of Coming Things"" which shows off all the ""futuristic"" inventions of the series- ""The History of Brisco County"" with interviews of Campbell, series creator Carlton Cuse, Clemenson, Rutherford and the now sadly departed Julius Carry.- ""Tools of the Trade"" which is a short featurette gallery.- ""A Reading from the Book of Bruce"" This is Bruce Campbell reading from the chapter from his book, ""If Chins Could Kill: Confessions of a B Movie Actor"" that recounts his experiences on Brisco. A really nice extra in the DVD.- ""A Brisco County Writer's Room"" This features all the writing staff along with Cuse discussing their time on Brisco County.All of the extras help make this a wonderful DVD package and one of the better ones on the market today. All of the episodes are wonderfully produced and still hold up very well.As I was watching the episodes with a couple of friends, they could not believe that such an entertaining show was cancelled. I would have to agree, ""The Adventures of Brisco County, Jr."" remains one of the absolute best television series to never make it past a single season.

Now I can relive this classic show starring the one and only Bruce Campbell.The show tells the story of Brisco County Jr. (Campbell), a Harvard lawyer-turned-bounty hunter, who is tasked with by a group of robber barons with finding and apprehending the outlaw gang of John Bly (Billy Drago). Along the way, County goes about this task with Lord Bowler (Julius Carry), a rival bounty hunter who becomes his friend, Socrates Poole (Christian Clemonson), a legal councilor and liason between County and the robber barons, Dixie Cousins (Kelly Rutherford), a saloon singer and femme fatale, and Prof. Wickwire (John Astin), an inventor extraordinaire. The search for Bly becomes personal for County as Bly murdered his father, a U.S. Marshall, during the escape. Meanwhile, both County and Bly find themselves searching for the Orb, a mystical artifact of great power.What can be said about this show? It was more than a western. It had comedy, action and sci-fi as well. It also never took itself too seriously and was appropriate for the whole family.In addition, I recieved a used copy of this, but found out it was scratched up at certain points. So I contacted the seller and they sent me another one that works great. So it was great service on thier end.I highly recommend this series to anyone.

The cult favorite show that was once a Friday night lead-in for the X-Files was yet another show that was untimely pulled by the geniuses at Fox (a list that also includes Firefly, Harsh Realm, The Lone Gunmen, Space: Above & Beyond, I could go on), but unlike those shows, the Adventures of Brisco County Jr. actually lasted for longer than a season, an provided for much entertainment and engaging stories.  Bruce ""Evil Dead"" Campbell stars as the son of the legendary lawman, who was murdered by the evil Bly (Billy Drago) who has some big agendas.  Brisco is teamed up with his trusty, and incredibly intelligent, horse named Comet, and finds a reluctant ally with bounty hunter Lord Bowler (Julius Carry) in his long pursuit of Bly.  Campbell's instantly likeable charm makes Brisco County an enjoyable hero to watch, but it's the storytelling that makes the show something special as it takes an unpredictable turn as Bly's intentions and origin are revealed.  The series comes to an end when Brisco and Bowler are accused of high treason (and chased by Terry Bradshaw) and are on the run, but everything is wrapped up nicely.  It's fantastic to see that this much loved show is finally making it's way to DVD with actual extras, but the list price may be too steep for some.  Despite that though, this beloved series will delight old fans and newcomers alike, and besides, how often do you see something with Bruce Campbell that a Raimi isn't involved in?",5,"Finally, Brisco is on DVD!!!",1149033600,"05 31, 2006",2006,1507,"['Brisco', 'County', 'Jr.', 'finally', 'coming', 'DVD', 'cult', 'favorite', 'show', 'was', 'once', 'Friday', 'night', 'lead-in', 'X-Files', 'was', 'yet', 'show', 'was', 'untimely', 'pulled', 'geniuses', 'Fox', 'list', 'also', 'Firefly', 'Harsh', 'Realm', 'Lone', 'Gunmen', 'Space', 'Above', 'Beyond', 'could', 'go', 'shows', 'Adventures', 'Brisco', 'County', 'Jr.', 'actually', 'lasted', 'longer', 'season', 'provided', 'much', 'entertainment', 'engaging', 'stories', 'Bruce', 'Evil', 'Dead', 'Campbell', 'son', 'legendary', 'lawman', 'who', 'was', 'murdered', 'evil', 'Bly', 'Billy', 'Drago', 'who', 'big', 'agendas', 'Brisco', 'teamed', 'up', 'trusty', 'incredibly', 'intelligent', 'horse', 'named', 'Comet', 'reluctant', 'ally', 'bounty', 'hunter', 'Lord', 'Bowler', 'Julius', 'Carry', 'long', 'pursuit', 'Bly', 'Campbell', 'instantly', 'likeable', 'charm', 'Brisco', 'County', 'enjoyable', 'hero', 'watch', 'storytelling', 'show', 'something', 'special', 'unpredictable', 'turn', 'Bly', 'intentions', 'origin', 'are', 'revealed', 'series', 'end', 'when', 'Brisco', 'Bowler', 'are', 'accused', 'high', 'treason', 'chased', 'Terry', 'Bradshaw', 'are', 'run', 'everything', 'wrapped', 'up', 'nicely', 'fantastic', 'see', 'much', 'loved', 'show', 'finally', 'making', 'way', 'DVD', 'actual', 'extras', 'list', 'price', 'may', 'be', 'too', 'steep', 'though', 'beloved', 'series', 'will', 'delight', 'old', 'fans', 'newcomers', 'alike', 'besides', 'how', 'often', 'do', 'see', 'something', 'Bruce', 'Campbell', 'Raimi', ""n't"", 'involved']",N/A

This is the DVD release of the year and it gets SIX Stars!!! 27 episodes on 10 DVDs with tons of extras, this is the MOTHERLODE DVD set for this cult classic TV show. Not really a western, although it was cleverly disguised as one, it finally became in the end an incredible ""SciFi Western"" (really!) with some of the funniest and most adventurous writing and acting of the 90s. A relentless sheriff, a different kind of bounty hunter, a government emissary with a pipeline to the upper reaches of the government, and one really smart horse.Just when you thought they had run out of ideas, they'd come up with a wild character like the sexy Miss Dixie Cousins (the incredibly beautiful Kelly Rutherford), the amazing Whip Morgan, the Professor (John Astin), Crystal Hawks (Sheena Easton), or a naked female time-traveler (really, no kidding!!) to send the series spinning off in a new direction. And hanging over the entire series was a supremely nasty bad guy named Bly played wonderfully by Billy Drago and a funny metallic object  (sorry, this is a spoiler), a wonderfully funny but smart wonder horse named Comet, and always... ""The Coming Thing"". The adventurous theme music of this show went on to become one of the themes of an Olympic Games telecast. SIX HUGE Stars for this amazing TV series.(Notes:* Trivia: Executive producer Carlton Cuse played Owen in the pilot.*When the greedy Fox TV Network decided they wanted better ratings than Brisco was delivering (which were very decent), they unwittingly created the ""Black Hole of Friday Night TV"", show after show (and millions of dollars) disappeared into the 'Brisco County Jr Black Hole': remember M.A.N.T.I.S? VR.5? Brimstone? Millennium (moved it to save it)? Strange Luck? John Doe (moved it to save it)? Sliders (3 Fox Seasons, jumping the shark twice)? And more recently in the 21 Century:  Doll House and Sarah Connor Chronicles. Yes, that's a good example of shows that crashed and burned usually within a year or two. Over a decade later, they finally replaced Brisco with another SciFi winner called ""FireFly"", which promptly got the same disgusting treatment from Fox TV and disappeared in less than a complete year, only to re-appear as a successful multi-million dollar theatrical movie called ""Serenity"" and a 500,000 unit selling ""Firefly"" DVD set and, thankfully, Fox got not a dime since they stupidly gave the complete rights to Joss Whedon. As of this review, a rerun of ""24"" occupies the old Brisco time slot.*Is there any chance Bruce and Co could make a movie of ""The Adventures of Brisco County, Jr""? Who's up for it?

This is probably why it was canceled.  I hadn't seen these shows since they were on tv, and I was curious as to how they would hold up years later.  Not only did they hold up, but I found myself enjoying them more than I had originally.  Over the course of only one season you start to look at these characters like old buddies.  Bruce Campbell is perfect(as usual), as is John Astin and Julius Carry.  And of course who can forget the immortal Billy Drago as the show's main villain, John Bly?  Not only was it a cool western, but there's a sci-fi element thrown in for a good half of the show, and it actually works.  All the outrageousness works coz the characters are so well drawn out.  However, watching this show is a bit depressing coz A) It only lasted one season, and B) it makes you realize just how awful television has got in the years since.  I mean, 1993 wasn't THAT long ago, and look how far it's all sunk.  The only shows you'll find on tv now are reality shows, lousy sitcoms and eight billion CSI/Law and Order clones.  Where the hell did all the good adventure shows go?  There just aren't any good serial-type adventures anymore.  You think a western series would get made or shown now?(Deadwood doesn't count, and even that got cut down in it's prime)  This was an excellent show that really got the green weenie, but now we can finally see it again after all these years.

This deluxe DVD set from Warner Brothers has all 27 episodes and a whole lot of very cool extras included. 13 years after it went off the air we have Brisco, Lord Bowler(Julius Carry), Dixie, Professor Wickwire and the evil John Bly back in circulation. Combining sci-fi with a western and comedy is unusual but it works on this marvelous show. The DVDs look and sound terrific overall.Brisco (Campbell)sets out to round up the 13 criminals his father was after before he was killed including the notorious John Bly. Bly is after the Orb a sphere with seemingly supernatural power. Meanwhile Brisco has to contend with a rival bounty hunter named Lord Bowler in his pursuit of Bly and runs into some remarkable inventions at the turn of the century. Fox does have the episodes out of order on disc one they present the fifth episode as the third but that's a minor quibble.This is a great set. I've seen some complaints about the price of the set but you're getting what you pay for here. It's a pity that Fox cancelled the show--it had a lot of potential but evidently the network felt that they could do better with other shows (that were less expensive and that Fox owned)in that time slot (they never did--every show AFTER Brisco had lower ratings and the quality of those shows continued to dip even further).The pilot episode features a very occasionally witty and infromative commentary track by star Campbell and co-producer/co-creator Carlton Cuse. Campbell discusses how much he enjoyed the show but also how much he missed working with the other actors. The show was not renewed in the off season so the cast never got a chance to say goodbye to each other. Cuse discusses the origin of the show how Fox approached him to put together a Indiana Jones-like serial TV show. He noticed that a lot of the serials were westerns and some were science fiction. He decided to combine the two. He and co-creator the late Jeffrey Boam (""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade"" and ""The Phantom"")went for a feel that Campbell discribes as ""just under over-the-top"".The bulk of the rest of the special features are on the last disc. We get a video representation of ""Brisco's Book of Coming Things"" where Brisco would often write down and illustrate items that he thought would have a large impact in the future. It's narrated by Bruce Campbell. ""The History of Brisco County"" features the stars of the show discussing their experience making the series along with Cuse (the other producer/creator on the show Jeffrey Boam died several years ago at the young age of 51. His creativity is sorely missed. Boam wrote ""Indiana Jones and The Last Crusade"", ""Lethal Weapon 3"", ""The Lost Boys"", ""The Dead Zone"" and ""Straight Time""). ""A Reading from the Book of Bruce"" features Campbell reading an amusing story from his book If Chins Could Kill. ""A Brisco County Writer's Room"" features the staff writers discussing the challenge of doing the show, what they learned in creating one of the most underappreciated hours on television and how the series has impacted their careers. ""Tools of the Trade"" is a clever section that includes info on what we would have been in season 2, stunts and riding.  Finally we get a booklet with notes by the star himself (no, not his horse Comet) Mr. Chin- Bruce Campbell.It took forever to arrive on a horse drawn carriage but the wait for ""Brisco"" was worth it. Packed with special features, 27 episodes and a nice transfer ""Brisco"" is silly, funny and serious adventure all wrapped up in one. In many respects ""Brisco"" is a descendant of shows like ""The Wild Wild West"" but with enough unique character to make it stand out. It's a pity that Fox cancelled the series as I'm sure if given the chance the show probably would have caught on just not coupled with ""The X-Files"".Highly recommended!",5,Saddle up partner!
