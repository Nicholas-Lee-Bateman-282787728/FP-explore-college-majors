1046159,A2MJHH2UJGNJOT,B000MGBLV4,Brandon,"[1, 1]","MadeinUSA is a very interesting concept, a small religious town goes to the extreme with the execution of its mythology. They hold that, to this day, from the time when jesus was crucified until his resurection on Easter: God is dead. During this time there is no one to impart morals onto the world, so there is no sin and there is no guilt. This amnesty makes everyone in the town indulge their dark, lascivious side: including a stranger from Lima who stirs a young girl from the blind devotion to the tradition that harms her. This could be used as the premise for all sorts of gore and exploitation, but luckily MadeinUSA doesn't go that route. It explores what is left after the superego leaves a supressed society. At times the film feels a bit too voyeuristic, but it is saved by the overwhelming feeling that such moral atrocities can only happen when the forboding fesivtal-cum-funeral march is reverberating through the town. At its heart, it is a scinitilating critique of a relience on society to dictate our behavior, when really we should be thinking for ourselves.",5,Indulge your dark side in a land with no sin,1271376000,"04 16, 2010",2010,1080,"['MadeinUSA', 'very', 'interesting', 'concept', 'small', 'religious', 'town', 'extreme', 'execution', 'mythology', 'hold', 'day', 'time', 'when', 'jesus', 'was', 'crucified', 'resurection', 'Easter', 'God', 'dead', 'time', 'one', 'impart', 'morals', 'world', 'sin', 'guilt', 'amnesty', 'everyone', 'town', 'indulge', 'dark', 'lascivious', 'side', 'including', 'stranger', 'Lima', 'who', 'young', 'girl', 'blind', 'devotion', 'tradition', 'could', 'be', 'used', 'premise', 'sorts', 'gore', 'exploitation', 'luckily', 'MadeinUSA', ""n't"", 'go', 'route', 'what', 'left', 'superego', 'supressed', 'society', 'times', 'film', 'bit', 'too', 'voyeuristic', 'saved', 'overwhelming', 'feeling', 'such', 'moral', 'atrocities', 'can', 'only', 'happen', 'when', 'forboding', 'fesivtal-cum-funeral', 'march', 'reverberating', 'town', 'heart', 'scinitilating', 'critique', 'relience', 'society', 'dictate', 'behavior', 'when', 'really', 'should', 'be', 'thinking', 'ourselves']",Madeinusa

Don Cayo, the town's mayor, locks him away so he won't interfere with the upcoming Holy Time. Holy Time occurs between Good Friday and Easter Sunday. The people of Manayaycuna believe that on these days God is dead and all sins are permitted. Salvador escapes from his locked pen and befriends Cayo's daughter Madeinusa. Salvador and Madeinusa plot to leave together for Lima. But, in the end, a disturbing twist changes the plan.Thi is a highly symbolic film aiming to be ""high art"". But I personally was left confused and unsatisfied. I believe that movies, and other creative forms, that are so vague in meaning as to become indecipherable are neither artistically successful nor pleasurable to watch. Some may like this film for it's lofty intentions.

1046161,AB6HEXPVLXFSO,B000MGBLV4,George W. Lynn,"[9, 11]","A fairly macabre story that would be something more at home on the Twilight Zone or in a painting by Brueghel. A Spanish stranger from Lima wanders into an Indian village during the Holy Time, the period of time between Good Friday and Easter, when by village tradition God is dead and cannot see the sins on the villagers. They don't want him there, he's a foreigner to them, and they don't want him to witness their actions during this special time. The local mayor locks him up to protect him, but he breaks out and wanders into a world he didn't know existed and can't begin to understand, even if parts of it look familiar. Madeinusa is the name of the young woman on the cover, chosen by her father the mayor to play the role of Mary during Holy Time. She dreams of escape into the modern world of Lima, away from her brutal father who has been waiting for Holy Time for his own perverted reasons. It's a fascinating decent into Hell and takes a number of interesting twists and turns. The actors are all strong in their roles and make film all too real. The cinematography is particluarly beautiful with the Andes in the background. Well worth seeing and a very unique effort.",4,A surprising effort,1236384000,"03 7, 2009",2009,1183,"['fairly', 'macabre', 'story', 'would', 'be', 'something', 'more', 'home', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'painting', 'Brueghel', 'Spanish', 'stranger', 'Lima', 'wanders', 'Indian', 'village', 'Holy', 'Time', 'period', 'time', 'Good', 'Friday', 'Easter', 'when', 'village', 'tradition', 'God', 'dead', 'can', 'not', 'see', 'sins', 'villagers', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'there', 'foreigner', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'witness', 'actions', 'special', 'time', 'local', 'mayor', 'locks', 'up', 'protect', 'out', 'wanders', 'world', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'existed', 'ca', ""n't"", 'begin', 'understand', 'even', 'parts', 'look', 'familiar', 'Madeinusa', 'name', 'young', 'woman', 'cover', 'chosen', 'father', 'mayor', 'play', 'role', 'Mary', 'Holy', 'Time', 'escape', 'modern', 'world', 'Lima', 'away', 'brutal', 'father', 'who', 'been', 'waiting', 'Holy', 'Time', 'own', 'perverted', 'reasons', 'fascinating', 'decent', 'Hell', 'number', 'interesting', 'twists', 'turns', 'actors', 'are', 'strong', 'roles', 'make', 'film', 'too', 'real', 'cinematography', 'particluarly', 'beautiful', 'Andes', 'background', 'Well', 'seeing', 'very', 'unique', 'effort']",Madeinusa

1046163,AOL6BG6SAFGQF,B000MGBLV4,Rufus Quail,"[4, 4]","Madeinusa is a 14-year-old girl who lives with her father and sister in a stone dwelling with a dirt floor. It's more substantial than a hut but too primitive to be called a house. There is no electricity. The kitchen faucet emits just a trickle of water.The family live in a remote village in the mountains of Peru. The nearest telephone is miles away. ""Made"" and her sister take turns spreading rat poison around the perimeter of the dwelling. Dead rats bring good luck. In just a few hours Made's father will have one of his fondest wishes realized. He'll have sex with his daughter. Made sings sad songs.The movie opens with the start of the Easter festival. The village's dozen or so young virgins, lavishly costumed, go on parade. Made is selected as the year's most beautiful. We learn that Made's dad is the town's mayor, a man highly esteemed in the region. The selection of his daughter makes his upcoming conquest all the more exciting!This festival has a twist.  The villagers have made it a tradition that God is dead from Good Friday to Easter Sunday.  He can't see their transgressions. Sin does not exist. A man can have sex with his daughter and it won't matter. Made has known for a long time that this day would come.  Incest is a natural part of life, something the village daughters stoically accept. Anyone suggesting there's something wrong with the arrangement might be stoned by these primitives. It's a fate that could be in store for any outsider who stumbles upon the warped festival.The film takes a detached view of the bizarre happenings. The wild party, called Holy Time, includes many beautifully-photographed scenes of pageantry and debauchery (although there are no graphic depictions of sex).  There's no attempt to manipulate the viewer's emotions, no effort to demonize or glorify any character.Made has the honor of kicking off Holy Time. In a solemn ceremony, the crucified Jesus is taken down from his perch and blindfolded.  This Jesus is a  comical mannequin, with moveable arms and eyes. Made kisses him reverently on the mouth.Although the villagers are free to do as they please, no one seems to have much fun. They act as if the festival is a religious observance in which they must dutifully participate. The merriment is robotic, not joyful.The movie is packed with astonishing imagery.  The musical score is hauntingly beautiful. Made's songs are incredibly touching.  It's one of the most moving and amazing movies I have seen. It's Claudia Llosa's first film.
