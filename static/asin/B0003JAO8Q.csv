Byrne ""Music Connaseur and Singer""","[6, 6]","Being a resident of Fairfield, it's a small enough world that I actually ended up working with one of the Tom kids!  The now adult Margaret is still extremely headstrong independent and amazing.  She has a strong work ethic and a zest for life unlike some people I've seen in our town.  The film only briefly shows her and at the same time, she is absolutely touching...her struggles with ""not doing enough"" and all must have been hell for her.  I respected her before I viewed to picture and now even more I respect her for staying strong in such a huge family.  Meeting all the kids is an amazing experience too!  Their mom is very humble, and even at my comment of ""I just have to say you are AWESOME"" she quietly said Thanks, and i brought them their food.  She really is remarkable...The family is remarkable, such honest special people.The film is nicely shot in digital video.  The family unit is shown and while dysfuntional is very much an all american family, with issues and hard times.  It is a definite break from the normal ""hollywood"" family. You don't see everyone smiling and acting like lifes just a breeze.  It's a beautiful emotional film with a heart and a great entertaining learned feel to it.  It is even better if you meet these remarkable individuals.  They really are beautiful people.",5,Moving and definately hits home,1120867200,"07 9, 2005",2005,1312,"['Being', 'resident', 'Fairfield', 'small', 'enough', 'world', 'actually', 'ended', 'up', 'working', 'one', 'Tom', 'kids', 'now', 'adult', 'Margaret', 'still', 'extremely', 'headstrong', 'independent', 'amazing', 'strong', 'work', 'ethic', 'zest', 'life', 'people', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'town', 'film', 'only', 'briefly', 'same', 'time', 'absolutely', 'touching', 'struggles', 'not', 'doing', 'enough', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'hell', 'respected', 'viewed', 'picture', 'now', 'even', 'more', 'respect', 'staying', 'strong', 'such', 'huge', 'family', 'Meeting', 'kids', 'amazing', 'experience', 'too', 'mom', 'very', 'humble', 'even', 'comment', 'just', 'have', 'say', 'are', 'AWESOME', 'quietly', 'said', 'Thanks', 'i', 'brought', 'food', 'really', 'remarkable', 'family', 'remarkable', 'such', 'honest', 'special', 'people.The', 'film', 'nicely', 'shot', 'digital', 'video', 'family', 'unit', 'shown', 'dysfuntional', 'very', 'much', 'all', 'american', 'family', 'issues', 'hard', 'times', 'definite', 'break', 'normal', 'hollywood', 'family', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'everyone', 'smiling', 'acting', 'lifes', 'just', 'breeze', 'beautiful', 'emotional', 'film', 'heart', 'great', 'entertaining', 'learned', 'feel', 'even', 'better', 'meet', 'remarkable', 'individuals', 'really', 'are', 'beautiful', 'people']",My Flesh and Blood
854816,ACXHNOC6L8LUO,B0003JAO8Q,Artist & Author,"[1, 1]","How does one review a movie he or she saw through misty eyes?  The handicaps these children have, to me, seem unimaginable.  Yes, it hurts anyone who loves kids to see a single one suffering, but that isn't what gives one the misty eyes in this movie.  In spite of their horrific injuries, birth defects or diseases, you see them here clearly as children.  They have the same innocence, the same hopes for life and for love, and they are able to care about the other children who seem to suffer more than them.  Wow!One cannot forget the selflessness of these kid's adoptive mother and her older birth daughter.  They have to be a team of saints.For me, this isn't a documentary to look at and say, ""Well, that's nice of them.  I feel sorry for the children.""  I think this is a movie that parents can, and should, show their school-age children as long as they can give their children any assurances they need.  [""Yes, you could get burnt like the little girl in this movie, but you'd be more likely to get hit by a car on the way to school and you do that every day without worry.""]Children are likely, however, to run into a schoolmate with some similar physical problem.  By watching this movie with them, parents have a wonderful opportunity to point out how lovingly the mother and sister treated these kids and to discuss with their children how they could be loving to handicapped or scarred kids they might meet.  This would be a safe way to help kids determine to overlook the deformities to look into the hearts of sick, scared or handicapped kids.  Could your child look at a little eight-year-old girl, burned beyond belief as a helpless baby, and also see her as the pretty girl she looks forward to becoming?

This is a story about many kids, including Joe, a young boy trapped in his anger who takes the world down with him -  - it is the story of two beautiful smart girls without legs and their struggle to find acceptance among their peers -  - This is a story about a young boy whose skin becomes unglued from his body and about a very special young girl (burn injury) named Faith and their valiant quest for love and life  - It is the story of their adoptee mother - who isn't perfect though she takes on a task few people would dare - This is a shining testimony to the strength and resolve within some people to conquer and rise above their challenges. It is a story about young Joe, who, unfortunately, dies trying. It's about children who don't mope and whine but buckle in and fight life to its fullest.  Highly recommended!

This emotionally intense documentary film is not about a smiley Brady Bunch, but about a raucous household of children with serious and severe problems--mental, physical, emotional and medical. Faith was horribly disfigured in a fire as an infant. Xenia was born with no legs. Teenager Joe is a deeply angry and explosive child who threatens to kill Xenia; he eventually dies from Cystic Fibrosis. Others are mentally retarded. Susan describes herself as ""fat but interesting."" Both adjectives understate the case. She does not work outside the home, but instead supports everyone, and her $600 a week grocery bill, from SSI income. Margaret, age 18, is unwillingly conscripted to help make it all work, and breaks down in screams to get her mother's attention.

Or is this the story of a very dysfunctional family, including one very disturbed child, one who  simply can not be saved? Or would he have been better off in a different family?This movie was both riveting and painful to watch and it was hard NOT to judge the adults in the movie: parents who abandoned their children, showing up for sporadic visits which only caused more pain to their children, emotional ups and downs, tensions and outright breakdowns. And yet, through it all, there was a spirit of resiliance, of hope and of getting a rare glimpse into a real family, with all its flaws and chipped edges.",4,I watched this one with mixed emotions,1114128000,"04 22, 2005",2005,752,"['too', 'might', 'be', 'wondering', 'did', 'story', 'dedicated', 'woman', 'open', 'heart', 'who', 'children', 'one', 'else', 'will', 'consider', 'story', 'very', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'including', 'one', 'very', 'disturbed', 'child', 'one', 'who', 'simply', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'saved', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'off', 'different', 'family', 'movie', 'was', 'riveting', 'painful', 'watch', 'was', 'hard', 'NOT', 'judge', 'adults', 'movie', 'parents', 'who', 'abandoned', 'children', 'showing', 'up', 'sporadic', 'visits', 'only', 'caused', 'more', 'pain', 'children', 'emotional', 'ups', 'downs', 'tensions', 'outright', 'breakdowns', 'yet', 'was', 'spirit', 'resiliance', 'hope', 'getting', 'rare', 'glimpse', 'real', 'family', 'flaws', 'chipped', 'edges']",My Flesh and Blood
854823,A2R6RA8FRBS608,B0003JAO8Q,Matthew G. Sherwin,"[4, 4]","My Flesh And Blood is an outstanding documentary that showcases one year in the lives of a woman and her adopted disabled children. Their life stories are told to varying degrees while the focus remains on the events that naturally occur over twelve months. We witness great suffering, hope, pain, joy, happiness, creativity, love and a deep drive on the part of everyone to keep on living, even if it's only one day at a time, in order to stay alive and enjoy the best quality of life possible while they're here on this Earth.The household is essentially run by a woman who has a heart of gold, Susan Tom. Despite the fact that her marriage didn't work out she adopted one more child after another until she had about eleven adopted kids in her home with varying degrees of different types of disabilities. Unlike some other reviewers, my heart went out the most to Joe Tom, who suffers from both cystic fibrosis and emotional problems. Joe lashes out verbally at other kids in the home because he was never loved the right way to begin with; and his birth mother isn't much of a help even when she thinks she is being helpful.  Joe threatens to hurt or even kill other kids in the household but he stops (at least) at verbal abuse; I have the feeling that if he had been treated with the proper therapist a lot of his emotional problems could have been greatly improved. In addition, I also felt a great deal of admiration for a young girl who has no legs; we see her happily enjoying life, swimming and even doing her own form of jumping rope using sneakers on her hands for balance! There's also the very touching and emotional portrait of a young man who has a rare genetic disorder that makes the skin less adhesive to the body; I couldn't believe how brave he was! Susan Tom lovingly gives him a bath four times each week--and that takes roughly three hours each time because his skin condition is so bad that she must go very slowly with the bath so as not to hurt him too badly. Wow!We also see Susan as a human being--with flaws as well as her strengths. Naturally, she is an inspiration to us all in that she has the patience to deal with all these children and she cares for them really rather well overall. That is, overall. We see how eventually Susan's own daughter breaks down in tears because Susan is so busy taking care of the adopted children that she doesn't have time for her own daughter! I thought Susan could have handled this better; she essentially tells her daughter that they'll schedule a time to talk about it the following morning. Susan just doesn't have the time to go into it right now. Gee, if Susan doesn't have time for her own daughter, can she truly sleep well at night? I suppose the answer is that she can; Susan believes that she IS doing the best that she can do under the circumstances; and there's certainly truth to that.The DVD comes with deleted scenes, follow-up interviews, and an interview with Susan's eldest sons in addition to other bonus features.My Flesh And Blood tells the remarkable story of a woman who loves children and taking care of others so much that she goes well beyond the call of duty to help as many disabled children as best she can regardless of the problems they have. I highly recommend this documentary, while Susan Tom isn't perfect (she's human, after all), she  cares the way we all should care; and that's what makes this film an important example of just how much love can do to improve the lives of those of us who are less fortunate.",5,one hundred percent engaging,1245369600,"06 19, 2009",2009,3518,"['Flesh', 'Blood', 'outstanding', 'documentary', 'one', 'year', 'lives', 'woman', 'adopted', 'disabled', 'children', 'life', 'stories', 'are', 'told', 'varying', 'degrees', 'focus', 'events', 'naturally', 'occur', 'twelve', 'months', 'witness', 'great', 'suffering', 'hope', 'pain', 'joy', 'happiness', 'creativity', 'love', 'deep', 'drive', 'part', 'everyone', 'keep', 'living', 'even', 'only', 'one', 'day', 'time', 'order', 'stay', 'alive', 'enjoy', 'best', 'quality', 'life', 'possible', ""'re"", 'here', 'Earth.The', 'household', 'essentially', 'run', 'woman', 'who', 'heart', 'gold', 'Susan', 'Tom', 'fact', 'marriage', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'out', 'adopted', 'one', 'more', 'child', 'had', 'eleven', 'adopted', 'kids', 'home', 'varying', 'degrees', 'different', 'types', 'disabilities', 'other', 'reviewers', 'heart', 'went', 'most', 'Joe', 'Tom', 'who', 'cystic', 'fibrosis', 'emotional', 'problems', 'Joe', 'out', 'verbally', 'other', 'kids', 'home', 'was', 'never', 'loved', 'right', 'way', 'begin', 'birth', 'mother', ""n't"", 'much', 'help', 'even', 'when', 'being', 'helpful', 'Joe', 'hurt', 'even', 'kill', 'other', 'kids', 'household', 'least', 'verbal', 'abuse', 'have', 'feeling', 'had', 'been', 'treated', 'proper', 'therapist', 'lot', 'emotional', 'problems', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'greatly', 'improved', 'addition', 'also', 'felt', 'great', 'deal', 'admiration', 'young', 'girl', 'who', 'legs', 'see', 'happily', 'enjoying', 'life', 'swimming', 'even', 'doing', 'own', 'form', 'jumping', 'rope', 'using', 'sneakers', 'hands', 'balance', 'also', 'very', 'touching', 'emotional', 'portrait', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'rare', 'genetic', 'disorder', 'skin', 'less', 'adhesive', 'body', 'could', ""n't"", 'believe', 'how', 'brave', 'was', 'Susan', 'Tom', 'lovingly', 'bath', 'four', 'times', 'week', 'roughly', 'three', 'hours', 'time', 'skin', 'condition', 'so', 'bad', 'must', 'go', 'very', 'slowly', 'bath', 'so', 'not', 'hurt', 'too', 'badly', 'Wow', 'also', 'see', 'Susan', 'human', 'being', 'flaws', 'as', 'well', 'strengths', 'Naturally', 'inspiration', 'patience', 'deal', 'children', 'really', 'rather', 'well', 'overall', 'overall', 'see', 'how', 'eventually', 'Susan', 'own', 'daughter', 'breaks', 'down', 'tears', 'Susan', 'so', 'busy', 'taking', 'care', 'adopted', 'children', ""n't"", 'have', 'time', 'own', 'daughter', 'thought', 'Susan', 'could', 'have', 'handled', 'better', 'essentially', 'daughter', ""'ll"", 'schedule', 'time', 'talk', 'following', 'morning', 'Susan', 'just', ""n't"", 'have', 'time', 'go', 'right', 'now', 'Gee', 'Susan', ""n't"", 'have', 'time', 'own', 'daughter', 'can', 'truly', 'sleep', 'well', 'night', 'suppose', 'answer', 'can', 'Susan', 'doing', 'best', 'can', 'do', 'circumstances', 'certainly', 'truth', 'that.The', 'DVD', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'follow-up', 'interviews', 'interview', 'Susan', 'eldest', 'sons', 'addition', 'other', 'bonus', 'features.My', 'Flesh', 'Blood', 'remarkable', 'story', 'woman', 'who', 'children', 'taking', 'care', 'others', 'so', 'much', 'well', 'call', 'duty', 'help', 'many', 'disabled', 'children', 'best', 'can', 'regardless', 'problems', 'have', 'highly', 'recommend', 'documentary', 'Susan', 'Tom', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'human', 'way', 'should', 'care', 'what', 'film', 'important', 'example', 'just', 'how', 'much', 'love', 'can', 'do', 'improve', 'lives', 'who', 'are', 'less', 'fortunate']",My Flesh and Blood

The film asks the question: At what point does giving become a need that reaches a point of no return. For example, the mother's biological daughter cries in anguish when she realizes her life is about helping her mother care for the adopted children while her own needs are left ignored. The film offers no easy answers. Nor does the film paint the mother in a simple light. She is a complex woman full of complex motivations for adopting more than a dozen children. The filmaker is sympathetic and offers no judgments. He simply allows us to struggle with making our own conclusions. The children are presented in a noncondescending light. They are loveable survivors. One twelve-year-old boy however is severely angry, largely in part because his biological mother abandoned him when his health problems became too difficult, and he shows that he is a danger to the other children. He talks freely about wanting to kill them.

It's almost hard to know where to begin.At first, you get the impression that Sue Tom (The Mom and ""a woman of a certain weight""), is so desperate for companionship that she creates her own brood by adopting special needs children. But not 15 minutes into the documentary you realize, this woman was *born* to be a Mom and is a gifted, patient, hyper-intelligent and compassionate soul.Then you realize how blessed these children are to have found someone willing and able to not only be their mom, but to love them unconditionally and raise them to be happy, mentally-healthy and perspicacious adults.And then there's the issue of the children. The first time I saw ""Faith"" (the little girl who was so badly burned) appear on screen, I had to close my eyes. Her physical appearance was very severe. But before the movie was half over, I found myself falling in love with this precious and precocious little girl. She's got a sweet nature and a wisdom that belies her age. Close your eyes and listen to her voice and you'll hear an angelic voice laced with a tenderness and thoughtfulness that is soul-stirring.And the ending is stunning. I'm still thinking about the ending.This documentary has changed the way I view the world and view others and think about myself. If I were queen of the world I'd sit everyone down one Sunday night and make them all (all six billion of us small-minded earthlings) watch this movie.",5,Too much to say; too good to miss!,1132185600,"11 17, 2005",2005,1480,"['are', 'so', 'many', 'good', 'things', 'could', 'say', 'movie', 'almost', 'hard', 'know', 'where', 'begin.At', 'first', 'get', 'impression', 'Sue', 'Tom', 'Mom', 'woman', 'certain', 'weight', 'so', 'desperate', 'companionship', 'own', 'brood', 'adopting', 'special', 'needs', 'children', 'not', '15', 'minutes', 'documentary', 'realize', 'woman', 'was', '*born*', 'be', 'Mom', 'gifted', 'patient', 'hyper-intelligent', 'compassionate', 'soul.Then', 'realize', 'how', 'blessed', 'children', 'are', 'have', 'found', 'someone', 'willing', 'able', 'not', 'only', 'be', 'mom', 'love', 'unconditionally', 'raise', 'be', 'happy', 'mentally-healthy', 'perspicacious', 'adults.And', 'then', 'issue', 'children', 'first', 'time', 'saw', 'Faith', 'little', 'girl', 'who', 'was', 'so', 'badly', 'burned', 'appear', 'screen', 'had', 'close', 'eyes', 'physical', 'appearance', 'was', 'very', 'severe', 'movie', 'was', 'half', 'found', 'falling', 'love', 'precious', 'precocious', 'little', 'girl', 'got', 'sweet', 'nature', 'wisdom', 'age', 'Close', 'eyes', 'listen', 'voice', ""'ll"", 'hear', 'angelic', 'voice', 'laced', 'tenderness', 'thoughtfulness', 'soul-stirring.And', 'ending', 'stunning', ""'m"", 'still', 'thinking', 'ending.This', 'documentary', 'changed', 'way', 'view', 'world', 'view', 'others', 'think', 'were', 'queen', 'world', ""'d"", 'sit', 'everyone', 'down', 'one', 'Sunday', 'night', 'make', 'six', 'billion', 'small-minded', 'earthlings', 'watch', 'movie']",My Flesh and Blood
