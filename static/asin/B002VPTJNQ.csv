Page is such a real and technical actress, without her - this movie would seem rather fluffy and shallow. Drew Barrymore directed and co-stars in this film, I was quite impressed with Barrymore's style of direction - I just didn't care for the character she portrays in this film.

1295872,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B002VPTJNQ,Andrew Ellington,"[3, 3]","Much more fun than I was expecting, `Whip It' is the equivalent of girl power personified by the coming of age inevitableness of life.  With a sharp and witty directorial debut by Drew Barrymore (who doesn't just LOVE her?), and a great cast (seriously, this ensemble is better than nearly every ensemble SAG chose to nominate), `Whip It' is a whole lot of fun; period.The film revolves around a young and awkward teenager named Bliss.  Her mother is controlling and her father avoids confrontation at all costs.  Bliss is a social outcast (as is made clear in the opening scene, she only has one friend) who is longing for something that makes her even slightly happy.  That is when a stroke of odd luck places her in the right place at the right time.  She catches a glimpse of happiness in the form of roller derby chicks.  After attending her first match, and officially declaring the roller clad females her new heroes, Bliss is persuaded to try-out for the team.  She smudges her age and lies to her parents and soon becomes the new `it' girl on the roller derby circuit.Bliss Cavendar by day, Babe Ruthless by night.I really like Ellen Page.  I really think that she is headed places.  Between her Oscar nominated turn in `Juno', her stunning (and quite different) turn in the previous years `Hard Candy' and now her memorable and touching performance here she has really proven she has range and is not just a one-trick pony (as some tried to make claim to after her `Smart People' performance proved to be very similar to her `Juno' one).  She finds a real soul in Bliss, exploiting (in a good way) everything that makes her, and her alter-ego, so special.Really, it is the acting (and Drew's brisk direction) that makes this film a must see.Mrs. Harden is always in top form for me and I really enjoy watching her act, so she was a delight for me.  She breathes life into a clich&eacute;d character (very clich&eacute;d when you think about it) and makes her feel fresh and new.  Alia Shawkat is splendid as Bliss's best friend Pash, and the nerdy Carlo Alban is effective, even if the film isn't really interested in him.  Landon Pigg is a stock boyfriend, but he has this boyish charm to him that makes him endearing even if he is rather unattractive.  Jimmy Fallon and Andrew Wilson really make the most of their characters (Fallon is especially funny) and Daniel Stern is sweet and tender as Bliss's father (the scene in the van in particular is a subtle yet heart tugging moment of paternal affection).And then you have all the roller derby ladies!Kristen Wiig, Eve, Drew Barrymore, Zoe Bell and especially Juliette Lewis are all in top form.  Wiig delivers her lines with a soft and affectionate tone that makes her feel like a real person (and that mother/daughter talk in the car was especially effective, endearing without every coming over sappy and out of place for the films humorous direction).  Barrymore demoted herself to slapstick sidekick, but she is HILARIOUS!  Lewis takes the cake for me with her ferocious take on Iron Mavon, Babe Ruthless's arch nemesis.  She appears like a stock villain in the beginning, with a little extra kick to make her pop out at you, but as the film progresses and she has her confrontation with Bliss you really see the other side to this woman, and remarkably Lewis was able to evoke a real sense of painful anger in her voice.Like I said, this ensemble is stellar.There are some plot holes.  It strikes me as rather ridiculous to conclude that Bliss could attend all those games without her very strict mother ever catching on.  Sure, she lied and had some alibis in the beginning, but she was out a lot and late at night, so it didn't really make sense.  The general plot point of Bliss alienating herself after finding something `new' seemed a little `been there done that', as did her conflicts with her mother, but they are forgivable.  The love interest side plot was a little predictable and kind of silly, but I like the directorial flourishes (the love scene in the pool, while `strange', was engaging and interesting to watch) found within it.In the end I was very satisfied with this film.  I give it a very high B (B+ even) and strongly recommend it for any fan of the genre or the cast.  It is sweet, funky, witty and ultimately full of enough to win you over completely.",4,The most fun on wheels I've had all year...,1265241600,"02 4, 2010",2010,4345,"['Much', 'more', 'fun', 'was', 'expecting', 'Whip', 'equivalent', 'girl', 'power', 'personified', 'coming', 'age', 'inevitableness', 'life', 'sharp', 'witty', 'directorial', 'debut', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'who', ""n't"", 'just', 'LOVE', 'great', 'cast', 'seriously', 'ensemble', 'better', 'nearly', 'ensemble', 'SAG', 'chose', 'nominate', 'Whip', 'whole', 'lot', 'fun', 'film', 'revolves', 'young', 'awkward', 'teenager', 'named', 'Bliss', 'mother', 'controlling', 'father', 'avoids', 'confrontation', 'costs', 'Bliss', 'social', 'outcast', 'made', 'clear', 'opening', 'scene', 'only', 'one', 'friend', 'who', 'longing', 'something', 'even', 'slightly', 'happy', 'when', 'stroke', 'odd', 'luck', 'right', 'place', 'right', 'time', 'glimpse', 'happiness', 'form', 'roller', 'derby', 'chicks', 'attending', 'first', 'match', 'officially', 'declaring', 'roller', 'clad', 'new', 'heroes', 'Bliss', 'persuaded', 'try-out', 'team', 'age', 'parents', 'soon', 'new', 'girl', 'roller', 'derby', 'circuit.Bliss', 'Cavendar', 'day', 'Babe', 'Ruthless', 'night.I', 'really', 'Ellen', 'Page', 'really', 'think', 'headed', 'places', 'Oscar', 'nominated', 'turn', 'Juno', 'stunning', 'quite', 'different', 'turn', 'previous', 'years', 'Hard', 'Candy', 'now', 'memorable', 'touching', 'performance', 'here', 'really', 'proven', 'range', 'not', 'just', 'one-trick', 'pony', 'tried', 'make', 'claim', 'Smart', 'People', 'performance', 'proved', 'be', 'very', 'similar', 'Juno', 'one', 'real', 'soul', 'Bliss', 'exploiting', 'good', 'way', 'everything', 'alter-ego', 'so', 'special.Really', 'acting', 'Drew', 'brisk', 'direction', 'film', 'must', 'see.Mrs', 'Harden', 'always', 'top', 'form', 'really', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'act', 'was', 'delight', 'life', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'character', 'very', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'when', 'think', 'feel', 'fresh', 'new', 'Alia', 'Shawkat', 'splendid', 'Bliss', 'best', 'friend', 'Pash', 'nerdy', 'Carlo', 'Alban', 'effective', 'even', 'film', ""n't"", 'really', 'interested', 'Landon', 'Pigg', 'stock', 'boyfriend', 'boyish', 'charm', 'endearing', 'even', 'rather', 'unattractive', 'Jimmy', 'Fallon', 'Andrew', 'Wilson', 'really', 'make', 'most', 'characters', 'Fallon', 'especially', 'funny', 'Daniel', 'Stern', 'sweet', 'tender', 'Bliss', 'father', 'scene', 'van', 'particular', 'subtle', 'yet', 'heart', 'tugging', 'moment', 'paternal', 'affection', 'then', 'have', 'roller', 'derby', 'ladies', 'Kristen', 'Wiig', 'Eve', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'Zoe', 'Bell', 'especially', 'Juliette', 'Lewis', 'are', 'top', 'form', 'Wiig', 'delivers', 'lines', 'soft', 'affectionate', 'tone', 'feel', 'real', 'person', 'mother/daughter', 'talk', 'car', 'was', 'especially', 'effective', 'endearing', 'coming', 'sappy', 'place', 'films', 'humorous', 'direction', 'Barrymore', 'demoted', 'slapstick', 'sidekick', 'HILARIOUS', 'Lewis', 'cake', 'ferocious', 'take', 'Iron', 'Mavon', 'Babe', 'Ruthless', 'arch', 'nemesis', 'stock', 'villain', 'beginning', 'little', 'extra', 'kick', 'make', 'pop', 'out', 'film', 'progresses', 'confrontation', 'Bliss', 'really', 'see', 'other', 'side', 'woman', 'remarkably', 'Lewis', 'was', 'able', 'evoke', 'real', 'sense', 'painful', 'anger', 'voice.Like', 'said', 'ensemble', 'are', 'plot', 'holes', 'rather', 'ridiculous', 'conclude', 'Bliss', 'could', 'attend', 'games', 'very', 'strict', 'mother', 'ever', 'catching', 'Sure', 'lied', 'had', 'alibis', 'beginning', 'was', 'out', 'lot', 'late', 'night', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'make', 'sense', 'general', 'plot', 'point', 'Bliss', 'alienating', 'finding', 'something', 'new', 'seemed', 'little', 'been', 'there', 'done', 'did', 'conflicts', 'mother', 'are', 'forgivable', 'love', 'interest', 'side', 'plot', 'was', 'little', 'predictable', 'kind', 'silly', 'like', 'directorial', 'flourishes', 'love', 'scene', 'pool', 'strange', 'was', 'engaging', 'interesting', 'watch', 'found', 'it.In', 'end', 'was', 'very', 'satisfied', 'film', 'give', 'very', 'high', 'B', 'B+', 'even', 'strongly', 'recommend', 'fan', 'genre', 'cast', 'sweet', 'funky', 'witty', 'ultimately', 'full', 'enough', 'win', 'over', 'completely']",Whip It

1295880,A2AN5WDTIQSLWU,B002VPTJNQ,Blue Leaf,"[1, 1]","I was disappointed in this film. Ellen Page plays Bliss Cavendar, a small-town teenager living in Texas. She is an outcast, working in a small diner and being influenced by her mother, (Marcia Gay Harden) to be in beauty pagents. One day while shopping Bliss sees a group of roller derby gals come skating into the store. She is intrigued and persuades her best friend Pash, (Alia Stewart) to go with her and see what ""roller-derbying"" is all about. As soon as she sees a real roller derby match she is hooked. She soon, unbelievably soon, becomes a member of an eccentric team of misfits and is dubbed ""Babe Ruthless"". The cast selection was great. I looked forward to seeing Ellen Page, Drew Barrymore, Juliette Lewis, and others but unfortunetly it was a waste of talent. Ellen Page's character was much too similar to her role in Juno. It seemed at first that she was working to avoid being typecast as Juno but then as the movie progressed she rapidly morphed into her old Juno character. This film could have been funnier if there had been a great script and I am sorry to say I was unimpressed by Ms. Barrymore's role as director. The film was really choppy and unformed. There were so many possibilities for this to be really campy but she and the screenwriters really came up short. It wasn't funny, it wasn't poignant, it wasn't original, it was just boring and I had seen it all before. It is a shame because I looked forward to being entertained and by the end I was almost alseep. I will give HATS OFF to two superb performances; Juliette Lewis as ""Iron Maiden"", the hardened superstar of the opposing team, and Kristen Wiig as ""Maggie Mayhem"", the sweet fellow teammate who acts as mother and guide to Bliss. They both were perfect in their roles. I will also mention a wonderful soundtrack that is original, creative and, as Drew tells us, is ""her present to her audience"".

The movie is full of fun characters and great lessons.  It features Ellen Page as a waitress in a small town who is basically bored and in need of something, she is just not sure what.  Then she hears about a Roller Derby event in a nearby town and decides to check it out.  After watching the Roller Derby skaters, she falls in love with the sport and with some motivation she tries out and makes it.  Now of course she does lie about her age and to her parents about what she is actually doing when skating, but the movie emphasizes to live in the moment and try out new things.  Ellen's character also shows off how you have to practice and how great it is to be part of a team.I really like this movie and think it would be cute for any ages.  It is not just a teen movie, although it does include teen romance, but it also has some great actors and actresses like Jimmy Fallon and Juliette Lewis.  I couldn't get my husband to watch this movie with me, because he thought it was all about girl power, but I do think he would have liked it because of the humor and action.

It really shouldn't come as a surprise that the world of roller derby gets their own entry as well.The movie follows Bliss, a young girl who constantly lives in the shadow of everyone around her. Whether its her overbearing, yet well meaning mother or her mocking classmates, Bliss usually puts up with everything. It is only when she discovers the world of roller derby that she begins to gain the self confidence that she so desperately needs.This was a cute film. It just wasn't a great film. While the plot has just about everything it needs to appeal to a general audience, I can't help but feel like there was something missing from the film. Part of me couldn't really understand how Bliss caught on to everything & became such a great derby player almost overnight, which was the only real problem I had with the film. I loved seeing how Bliss dealt with the issues surrounding her, especially towards the end. The acting is pretty good & I liked seeing that Bliss has some true love for her family- even when they don't see eye to eye. And I loved the guy who played Razor- he was just awesome as the coach.I just felt like this film needed a little bit more ""oomph"" to it in the non-derby scenes. When the derby scenes are on, the film really does come alive & it sparkles with energy. Unfortunately the non-derby scenes just needed a little extra something.But for what's Barrymore's first film, it's pretty darn good. It shows that she has promise as a director & I can expect her future films to just get better. Plus the soundtrack was just awesome.

It's also an entertaining spectacle, which is relief for me since I've never given much thought to women's Roller Derby (or even sports in general, but that's a topic for another day). Drew Barrymore has done well to hype it as her directorial debut; she proves that she not only has the technical skills, but also the ability to move a story along through dialogue, pacing, and emotion. Having practically grown up in front of the camera, I think it's safe to assume she knows a thing or two about what a film needs in order for it to work. The first thing she did right was cast Ellen Page, who has repeatedly demonstrated just how versatile an actress she is.She's no exception here. She plays seventeen-year-old Bliss Cavendar, who was raised in a middle-of-nowhere Texas town and gets by as a diner waitress. Her overbearing mother, Brooke (Marcia Gay Harden), a product of a very different set of standards, pressures Bliss into competing in beauty pageants, believing you have to make do with what you've got when you're young and attractive. When Bliss is made aware of a Roller Derby match in nearby Austin, she decides to go and see what all the fuss is about. Lo and behold, she likes what she sees. She then meets Maggie Mayhem (Kristen Wiig), a teammate for the Hurl Scouts, and is encouraged to try out for the team. Maggie is one of several teammates that has adopted a clever nickname; some of the other Hurl Scouts are Smashley Simpson (Drew Barrymore), Rosa Sparks (Eve), and the Manson Sisters (Kristen Adolfi and Rachel Piplica).Under the guise of taking an SAT studies class, Bliss sneaks away to Austin every week for practice. Conflict abounds: Not only have the Hurl Scouts never won a single game, Bliss' teammates are also unaware that she's underage (you have to be twenty-one in order to be considered for Roller Derby). By the time she starts participating in matches, she develops a rivalry with Iron Maven (Juliette Lewis), the confrontational leader of undefeated champions of Roller Derby, the Holy Rollers. Nevertheless, Bliss has never felt more alive. At long last, she has found something she loves to do, and she does it with people she enjoys being around. Eventually, she will have to find and maintain that delicate balance between her passion, her family, and her life back home, a process that isn't as easy as it might seem.One could see this film just for the satisfaction of watching an uplifting, inspirational sports film, as has been done so many times before. For me, what made this movie so enjoyable were the characters, most so interesting and well developed that they seemed authentic. Bliss, for example, is willful and determined, yet not so haughty that she only seems like a spoiled brat. There's a remarkably tender side to her, and yes, some of it is reserved for her mother. It would have been easy to write Brooke as a controlling, spiteful stereotype, but all of that is avoided--despite having unrealistic expectations and a dated ideal of successful womanhood, she genuinely cares about her daughter, and we sense that all throughout. The only character who poses a bit of a problem is Bliss' father, Earl (Daniel Stern), seemingly included just for the sake of physically and morally clashing with his wife.Other characters function as quirky interludes, like Bliss' supportive best friend, Pash (Alia Shawkat), the Hurl Scouts' eccentric coach, Razor (Andrew Wilson), and the boisterous Roller Derby announcer, ""Hot Tub"" Johnny Rocket (Jimmy Fallon). The screenplay even has room for a teen romance between Bliss and a guitarist named Oliver (Landon Pigg), who eventually swaps his coat for Bliss' Stryper tee shirt (which she claims is the only cool thing her mother ever gave her). Most of these characters, the last one especially, are expected, as is the inevitable final match between the Hurl Scouts and the Holy Rollers. And yet, it all comes together smoothly, making for a fun and endearing film that you'll want to see through to the end.The game sequences are quite effective on their own, not only because of the well choreographed skating maneuvers, but also because of the camerawork; every shot exploits the spectacle that is Roller Derby, gliding in time with the actors as they zoom over and around each other on an inclined track. Other shots reveal the grungy feel of a Roller Derby event, from the makeshift arena to the ramshackle benches to the screaming fans, most of whom look no older than twenty. This is interesting in and of itself, given the fact that, save for Bliss, all the teammates are in their early to late thirties; one of them even has a young son. Knowing these women are mostly in it for the love of the game, one wonders how long Bliss can keep playing right alongside them. But if there is a message attached to ""Whip It,"" it has nothing to do with what the future may or may not bring; this movie is all about living in the now and loving every minute of it.",4,Rolling

1295898,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B002VPTJNQ,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[20, 22]","Roller Derby.  I can easily remember turning on the television and watching the Los Angeles T-Birds. Personally, I didn't know if this was a true sport or if it was like wrestling and it was just sports entertainment.  But I was hooked.  Not sure if it was the blonde women with poofy hair throwing other women out of the rink or that one person who didn't look should be on the rink, actually kicking butt.  Needless to say, that roller derby has had its following for decades and now here we are with a film based on a character who takes part in roller derby competitions.""Whip It"" marks the directorial debut by actress Drew Barrymore (""E.T."", ""50 First Dates"", ""The Wedding Singer"", ""Charlie's Angels"" films) and is an adaptation of the novel ""Derby Girl"" by Shauna Cross, a fictionalized book of skating with the TXRD Lonestar Rollergirls.The independent film was released in theaters during the fall of 2009 and now makes its Blu-ray and DVD debut.  The Blu-ray edition comes with a second disc which contains a digital copy of the film.VIDEO & AUDIO:""Whip It"" is presented in 1080 High Definition (Widescreen 2:40:1), AVC @ 36 MBPS.  The film sports vibrant colors with the Hurl Scouts green outfits, while amber lights shine on the roller derby rink.  You can see details in the surroundings, especially injuries ala bloody noses to bruises.  Even the tattoos on Kristen Wiig are seen much clearly on HD.  Skin tones are natural and blacks are nice and deep.  Everything is visible from the freckles of Pash, to the sweat and tears of Bliss and the other girls during competition or the more emotional scenes of the film.  I will say that at first, I thought this was a period film shot in the '80s but you realize that the film focuses on Bliss living in a very small town.There is a fine amount of grain in the film and I didn't notice any compression artifacts, banding or any sign of DNR.  A solid Blu-ray release in terms of PQ from Fox.As for the audio, ""Whip It"" is featured in English 5.1 DTS-HD MA and Spanish, French 5.1 Dolby Digital.  The film is front and center channel driven.  Dialogue and music are both crystal clear but there is minimal use of surrounds.  You can hear crowd ambiance and the women racing on the rink and hitting the side rails and hearing the skates but its not immersive as I would have hoped but still, the film is not all about the roller derby and there are plenty of dialogue scenes and music-driven scenes that are very clear, with some songs having a nice kick of bass.  A pretty interesting soundtrack as well from '80s 38 Special's ""Caught Up in You"" to music from the Ramones and the Breeders.Subtitles are in English SDH and Spanish.SPECIAL FEATURES:""Whip It"" comes with a digital copy of the film and comes with a few special features:* Deleted Scenes - (16:14) Included is an alternate opening and eight deleted scenes.* Fox Movie Channel Presents Writer's Draft: Shauna Cross of ""Whip It"" - (3:04) A short featurette with an interview with novel and screenwriter Shauna Cross about ""Whip It"".* Whip It Soundtrack Spot - (:32) A promotional for the ""Whip It"" soundtrack.JUDGMENT CALL:""Whip It"" may seem like a film about roller derby and the antics that go behind-the-scenes of the sport but truthfully, the film has many layers.  From a coming-of-age film, a relationship movie and a girl power film, there are a good number of things going on in this film that there is far much more to enjoy than expected.I have to admit that Drew Barrymore's directorial debut definitely shows promise.  The actress has starred in so many films since she was a child and has worked with a good number of quality director's, I had no doubt that she would do a pretty solid job.Part of the challenge of ""Whip It"" is bringing together this wild bunch of characters that the character Bliss associates with and then bringing this other side of her life as a teenager from a small town, having an overbearing pageant mother and working at a fast food restaurant while trying to maintain her friendship with her high school friends and then finding love.  Definitely not an easy task for Barrymore but one thing she does have is the original author Shauna Cross involved with the screenplay and she has a talented actress in Ellen Page in the main role.At first glance, I didn't know if Page can pull of such a role but as she did with ""Juno"" she manages to pull of Bliss very well for ""Whip It"".As for the other supporting characters, personally I don't if roller derby lifestyles are similar to what is depicted in the movie.  As much as I do enjoy Barrymore's directorial debut, her role as Smashley Simpson is a bit too much while I do feel Kristen Wiig manages to pull off another solid supporting role like she has done in ""Extract"" and Juliette Lewis still does a great job in portraying the bad girl.  Marcia Gay Harden and Daniel Stern (who plays Bliss's father) also do a good job as the parents of Bliss.As for the Blu-ray, the picture quality for the film was very good and the lossless audio was satisfactory but it would have been great to have it a bit more immersive via use of the surround channels.  And it would have been great to have audio commentary by Barrymore and Shauna Cross or even a featurette on how the talent prepared for the film or even  Behind-the-scenes footage.  I felt the special features were a bit short for this Blu-ray release.  But as for the film, ""Whip It"" is an entertaining, humorous and a solid coming-of-age, feel-good style of film.  And again, although roller derby does play a big part in this film, ""Whip It"" is not an all out sports movie.  The film has many layers to it and fortunately, the solid performances definitely made this film enjoyable.Overall, ""Whip It"" is a solid directorial debut from Drew Barrymore and fine performances by Ellen Page and its supporting cast makes this film better than expected.",3,"Blu-ray: Enjoyed it more than I expected.

1295903,A28S3F43F76HSH,B002VPTJNQ,"D. Sorel ""book lovah""","[1, 1]","Last week I rented Whip It because I love Ellen Page and think that she is hilarious. Though I was a bit disappointed, I thought that the movie was not without a certain amount of charm. The plot is simple, Ellen Page (Sarah Habel) is caught between her dreams and those of her mother (played by Marcia Gay Harden). While her mother enrolls Sarah in various beauty pageants, Sarah is drawn to roller derbies and its subculture. Though she does not want to disappoint her mother, she knows that she must follow her dreams.The plot appears extremely simple and cliched but Barrymore and Page are able to make a jaded storyline more appealing than other films in the genre. Perhaps the reason for this is because Sarah's dream does not include increasing her popularity and dating the hunky guy at school. Instead it involves a sport and culture that is often considered part of the underbelly of the sports scene (that's when it's even acknowledged at all!). Things seem to get a bit hackneyed when Sarah falls for a band member in a local grunge band. However, that storyline is fleeting and the focus is placed once more on Sarah's conflicting feelings and subsequent personal growth. The movie could have been more interesting if there was a greater focus on roller derbies and less on Sarah's own inner turmoil. Yet, the movie was not intended to be solely about roller derbies and therefore the balance between the two was handled nicely. Overall, it's a story about girl power in the least irritating and most convincing way. As Drew Barrymore's directorial debut, this film shows that she has great potential as a director in this genre.

1295909,AUUH6Z8MSGGF,B002VPTJNQ,Haunted Flower,"[2, 2]","""Whip It"" was directed by Drew Barrymore and the screenplay and novel were both written by Shauna Cross. It stars Ellen Page as Bliss Cavendar, a young girl struggling to get out of her small town life constantly trying to please her mother by entering beauty pageants she doesn't like until she discovers a roller derby league in Austin, TX.This was a very fun story to tell. Ellen Page fits right in as the misfit who has clever things to say and is brave enough to secretly rebel against her mom. I think her performance in Juno was much stronger but I still enjoyed her journey. Bliss's mother, Brooke is played by Marcia Gay Harden who floored me with how scary she could be in ""The Mist"" and played just the right amount of hardness with occasional softness towards her daughter. She played a pageant mom hook, line, and sinker. Absolutely perfect casting.Bliss's best friend, Pash is played by Alia Shawkat whom you'd remember as Maybe from Arrested Development. What I love about this actress - she's quick, she knows her comedy, and she's a real girl looking at her. Her freckles are adorable and their relationship made me wish I had a best friend growing up I could depend on like that.The roller derby girls are played by Kristen Wiig, Zoe Bell, Eve, Drew Barrymore, and a very fun performance by Juliette Lewis as Iron Maven, Bliss's rival from another team. She managed to be VERY intimidating for such a small girl. If I could change something, I would stop her from wearing those low-cut v-neck shirts because her pecs make her look a little manish and that was weird. Her acting was fun to watch as she sized up the new peanut and tried not to show how much it bothered her. The girls on Bliss's team all did well with the physicality and all were distinctly different from each other. Sometimes I felt Drew Barrymore's character was a little too stupid, but it's her movie I guess.There's a subplot of a romantic relationship with a boy named Oliver played by Landon Pigg as part of her process of coming out of her shell and giving her extra stress in her relationship with her mother, but it felt pretty unnecessary. It would have been a better girl power movie without it. And I'm getting tired of the cliche of two young people being brought together over a love of vinyl records which automatically makes them deep.Not a bad first time around directing for Drew. At first I had a hard time seeing what was going on at the derby in the first few action shots but it got better over time. I also appreciated the rules segment to explain to the audience how this game was played.My biggest complaint and the worst casting was Jimmy Fallon. He was terrible. Not funny, really scrubby, I just wanted him off the screen. I'm very disappointed in him. And to think I used to have a crush on him when he was on SNL. I don't think he's as talented as people thought then.All in all, a very fun movie. I loved the intensity of the roller derby, Marcia Gay Harden's acting was the best of the film, loved seeing Maybe, and Daniel Stern (Marv from ""Home Alone"") was a wonderful surprise as Bliss's father. For exercise in the summer, all I do is roller skate so this movie really made me want to break my skates out of their winter hibernation....",4,Whip It Movie Review,1269129600,"03 21, 2010",2010,3258,"['Whip', 'was', 'directed', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'screenplay', 'novel', 'were', 'written', 'Shauna', 'Cross', 'Ellen', 'Page', 'Bliss', 'Cavendar', 'young', 'girl', 'struggling', 'get', 'small', 'town', 'life', 'constantly', 'trying', 'please', 'mother', 'entering', 'beauty', 'pageants', ""n't"", 'like', 'roller', 'derby', 'league', 'Austin', 'TX.This', 'was', 'very', 'fun', 'story', 'tell', 'Ellen', 'Page', 'right', 'misfit', 'who', 'clever', 'things', 'say', 'brave', 'enough', 'secretly', 'rebel', 'mom', 'think', 'performance', 'Juno', 'was', 'much', 'stronger', 'still', 'enjoyed', 'journey', 'Bliss', 'mother', 'Brooke', 'played', 'Marcia', 'Gay', 'Harden', 'who', 'floored', 'how', 'scary', 'could', 'be', 'Mist', 'played', 'just', 'right', 'amount', 'hardness', 'occasional', 'softness', 'daughter', 'played', 'pageant', 'mom', 'hook', 'line', 'sinker', 'Absolutely', 'perfect', 'casting.Bliss', 'best', 'friend', 'Pash', 'played', 'Alia', 'Shawkat', 'whom', ""'d"", 'remember', 'Maybe', 'Arrested', 'Development', 'What', 'love', 'actress', 'quick', 'comedy', 'real', 'girl', 'looking', 'freckles', 'are', 'adorable', 'relationship', 'made', 'wish', 'had', 'best', 'friend', 'growing', 'up', 'could', 'depend', 'that.The', 'roller', 'derby', 'girls', 'are', 'played', 'Kristen', 'Wiig', 'Zoe', 'Bell', 'Eve', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'very', 'fun', 'performance', 'Juliette', 'Lewis', 'Iron', 'Maven', 'Bliss', 'rival', 'team', 'managed', 'be', 'VERY', 'intimidating', 'small', 'girl', 'could', 'change', 'something', 'would', 'stop', 'wearing', 'low-cut', 'v-neck', 'shirts', 'pecs', 'make', 'look', 'little', 'manish', 'was', 'weird', 'acting', 'was', 'fun', 'watch', 'sized', 'up', 'new', 'peanut', 'tried', 'not', 'show', 'how', 'much', 'bothered', 'girls', 'Bliss', 'team', 'all', 'did', 'well', 'physicality', 'were', 'distinctly', 'different', 'other', 'Sometimes', 'felt', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'character', 'was', 'little', 'too', 'stupid', 'movie', 'guess.There', 'subplot', 'romantic', 'relationship', 'boy', 'named', 'Oliver', 'played', 'Landon', 'Pigg', 'part', 'process', 'coming', 'shell', 'giving', 'extra', 'stress', 'relationship', 'mother', 'felt', 'pretty', 'unnecessary', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'girl', 'power', 'movie', ""'m"", 'getting', 'tired', 'cliche', 'two', 'young', 'people', 'being', 'brought', 'together', 'love', 'vinyl', 'records', 'automatically', 'deep.Not', 'bad', 'first', 'time', 'around', 'directing', 'Drew', 'first', 'had', 'hard', 'time', 'seeing', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'derby', 'first', 'few', 'action', 'shots', 'got', 'better', 'time', 'also', 'appreciated', 'rules', 'segment', 'explain', 'audience', 'how', 'game', 'was', 'played.My', 'biggest', 'complaint', 'worst', 'casting', 'was', 'Jimmy', 'Fallon', 'was', 'terrible', 'Not', 'funny', 'really', 'scrubby', 'just', 'wanted', 'off', 'screen', ""'m"", 'very', 'disappointed', 'think', 'used', 'have', 'crush', 'when', 'was', 'SNL', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'as', 'talented', 'people', 'thought', 'then.All', 'very', 'fun', 'movie', 'loved', 'intensity', 'roller', 'derby', 'Marcia', 'Gay', 'Harden', 'acting', 'was', 'best', 'film', 'loved', 'seeing', 'Maybe', 'Daniel', 'Stern', 'Marv', 'Home', 'Alone', 'was', 'wonderful', 'surprise', 'Bliss', 'father', 'exercise', 'summer', 'do', 'roller', 'skate', 'movie', 'really', 'made', 'want', 'break', 'skates', 'winter', 'hibernation']",Whip It

The story is predictable but as I said it is all so much fun. Ellen's bra in her love scenes is very pretty, but all the love scenes are romantic rather than erotic. Ellen Page absolutely throws herself into every role she has had. She can be a horrifying, vengeful 14 year old (Hard Candy), an unhappy conservative young student (Smart People)or of course Juno, the lovable pregnant 16 year old, and other characters. Each she does convincingly. If Ellen Page is in a movie, there is at least one reason to see it.I shouldn't neglect the others. The supporting actors are all great. Barrymore has a small supporting role but is a riot. The other skaters hold their own in delivering fun and support. The skating scenes are full of action but are not graphically gory.

If you mix water, corn syrup, high fructose corn syrup, hydrogenated coconut oil, hydrogenated palm kernel oil, some flavors, gums, and glues, and freeze it, you get something that looks like whipped cream but bears no other resemblance.This film aspires to be whipped cream, but is tepid whip at best. Start with every teenager-as-protagonist cliche: overbearing, obsessive mother, browbeaten father, cute-as-a-button-little sister, no-one-understands me teen. Add quirky best friend. Stir in newly-met sexy person of opposite sex who looks trustworthy, but, oh well. Mix in a bunch of wild and crazy supporting characters (and make sure one of them drives a cool 60's car, MG if possible, but Karmann Ghia will do in a pinch.) Seen this film a hundred times before?After the viewer is thoroughly bored, pour in a healthy dose of plodding action. Now, I've been to lots of roller derby bouts. They can be very exciting. But those I've attended looked nothing like the action shown here. These were both too fast, as our little inexperienced skater scooted through huge crowds effortlessly, and too slow, as the camera tried to create action where there was none. The failure of the roller derby scenes would not doom the film. Heck, this could be a stage play with some Equus-style skating. But since they went to the effort to try to create it, it did not work.OK, so by now you've got a cliche-riddled tepid mixture of overcooked and bland ingredients. But then, just to show your culinary skills, drop in the most silly and outlandish ""Lose your virginity"" scene ever filmed. Toss in the requisite ""parents coming to the teen's point of view"" conclusion, and you have created Bland Whip.

My husband and I watched this with our 12  year old daughter, and we all liked this movie very much.  With little gore and mild sex that is more referred to than shown, WHIP IT is definitely refreshing and fun.WHIP IT is the story of Bliss, a seventeen-year-old diner waitress in a backwater town near Austin, Texas. Bliss is basically a good girl, doing everything her overbearing mother asks, including competing in (and often winning) beauty pageants.  But Bliss really wants to make more of her life, and to find her own path.  When she finds a flyer advertising a Roller Derby match in Austin, she and her best friend sneak out to the big city and have an adventure.  Something about the Roller Derby and the women who compete strike a chord in Bliss, and one of the teams invites her to try out.  Before she quite knows what is happening, Bliss makes the team and becomes a Hurl Scout.  Bliss then has many life decisions to make, each of which has significant consequences.  Can Bliss find the path that will make her truly happy?Ellen Page is delightful and dead on as Bliss.  I really like the heart and soul that Ellen puts into her characters.  The rest of the cast is excellent and equally talented (including director Drew Barrymore, Marcia Gay Harden, and Kristen Wiig), but Ellen Page truly carries this film.  WHIP IT is well paced, slow and thoughtful where appropriate, yet full of excitement and great action at the Roller Derby.  And I always like the messages from Ms. Barrymore's films...girls can do anything.  Something I definitely want to instill in my 12  year old.WHIP IT is a unique combination of sports action, teen coming of age, and family genres that works and works really well.

In this movie, you will see Jimmy Fallon, Drew Barrymore, Andrew Wilson (Owen Wilson's brother) as the coach, Drew Barrymore, the very talented Kirsten Wiig of SNL, Academy Award winner Marcia Gay Harden plays the mother, also features Juliette Lewis as her archrival and this is the first movie Drew Barrymore has directed, and she does a tremendous job.  An excellent cast that elevates this movie somewhat above the ordinary.Most young women I feel sure will relate to this heroine story. I don't think there are enough inspiring movies for female teens these days.I hope you find this helpful.

1295930,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B002VPTJNQ,Mark Turner,"[5, 5]","Not all movies are made to be Oscar contenders. Many are made to simply fill theater seats and offer solid entertainment and an enjoyable time. More often than not, these films offer a chance to see heroes made or characters that get the opportunity to follow their dreams. Such is the case with WHIP IT, the directorial debut of Drew Barrymore.Bliss Cavender (Ellen Page) is an unenthusiastic beauty queen contestant. Fulfilling the dreams of her mother Brooke (Marcia Gay Harden) more than herself, Bliss does as she is told between school and working at the local BBQ restaurant. Bliss feels nothing more than trapped in small town Bowdeen, Texas.While clothes shopping with her mother in Austin, Bliss happens to see a group of girls on skates come into the store they're in. Leaving behind a stack of flyers, Bliss picks one up to see that these are roller derby competitors trying to promote their next match.Sneaking off with best friend Pash (Alia Shawkat), Bliss is totally taken in by the whole scene. The match takes place in a converted warehouse where emcee Johnny Rocket (Jimmy Fallon) announces the girls as they make their way to the track. With names like Iron Maven, Smashly Simpson and Maggie Mayhem you can tell this is no skate in the park. The girls come out rocking and knocking, making an impression on young Bliss. When she tells Maggie afterwards that she is her new hero, Maggie suggests she come to practice and try out.Once home, Bliss begins skating once more in her Barbie skates, remnants of times gone by. She progresses from just being able to stand to skating through town. The day comes and she sneaks off again for Austin just in time to try out. With more speed than most of the rest trying out, Bliss gets her chance. Now all she has to do is sneak off to the matches.The girls welcome Bliss in as one of the Hurl Scouts, a losing team that has resolved to stay in last place. But with the speed Bliss shows them and the ribbing they take from the other squads, the team slowly gels into a force to be reckoned with. It also makes Bliss a target for Iron Maven (Juliette Lewis), an aging star who wants to retain her position.Along the way Bliss also picks up a new boyfriend. Oliver (Landon Pigg) is a member of a band that played at one of the house parties thrown by the team. The pair seems to connect but an upcoming tour tosses them into the possibility of a break up.As Bliss, now known as Babe Ruthless, moves into the world of roller derby, she begins to distance herself from her friends. And when her parents find out about her lies (as does her team when it's revealed she's too young to skate without her parent's permission), Bliss finds herself alone.The team now has a chance at the finals. The only thing stopping this from happening is Bliss' family. Resigned to beauty pageants once more, Bliss heads out to a new contest, her mother's favorite, the same night as the big contest. Is there a chance of her making it? Come on, this is a movie folks!Is this movie believable? No way. First off no league would put themselves in the position of being shut down due to a teenager not being old enough. And the chances of walking in off the street and being better than anyone else? Slim to none. But it doesn't matter. What matters is feeling a sense of hope for Bliss as she has that opportunity to move beyond a life she hates into one she loves, finding that one thing in life that makes her feel more than she has ever before.The acting in the film is solid, especially by Ellen Page. Changing from the shy Bliss who enters contests at her mothers request to becoming the young woman who makes her own decisions is fleshed out in her performance. Page has done such a great job with various roles in films like JUNO, HARD CANDY and even X-MEN that I'm beginning to think she's one of the best actresses around these days.The supporting cast also does a great job. Barrymore takes on a small part as one of the derby girls as does singer Eve and stuntwoman Zoe Bell. But the one who stood out for me was Kristen Wiig as Maggie Mayhem. Wiig is one of the series regulars on SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE these days and what I've seen of her there is far too over the top. But like Robin Williams when given the right director, she comes through with a great performance as a single mom skater who acts as surrogate mom to Bliss.Barrymore's first outing as director shows that she can put together a well made film. It's entertaining, fun and delivers everything the previews said it would. As I said, this isn't Oscar material but it is a fun film. Predictable at times but its less about the end result and more about the path taken to get there that makes movies like these work or fail. In this case, the movie works. So take a couple turns around the track and give this one a look.",4,ROLLER DERBY QUEEN,1265068800,"02 2, 2010",2010,4832,"['Not', 'movies', 'are', 'made', 'be', 'Oscar', 'contenders', 'Many', 'are', 'made', 'simply', 'fill', 'theater', 'seats', 'offer', 'solid', 'entertainment', 'enjoyable', 'time', 'More', 'often', 'not', 'films', 'offer', 'chance', 'see', 'heroes', 'made', 'characters', 'get', 'opportunity', 'follow', 'dreams', 'Such', 'case', 'WHIP', 'IT', 'directorial', 'debut', 'Drew', 'Barrymore.Bliss', 'Cavender', 'Ellen', 'Page', 'unenthusiastic', 'beauty', 'queen', 'contestant', 'Fulfilling', 'dreams', 'mother', 'Brooke', 'Marcia', 'Gay', 'Harden', 'more', 'Bliss', 'told', 'school', 'working', 'local', 'BBQ', 'restaurant', 'Bliss', 'nothing', 'more', 'trapped', 'small', 'town', 'Bowdeen', 'Texas.While', 'shopping', 'mother', 'Austin', 'Bliss', 'see', 'group', 'girls', 'skates', 'come', 'store', ""'re"", 'Leaving', 'stack', 'flyers', 'Bliss', 'one', 'up', 'see', 'are', 'roller', 'derby', 'competitors', 'trying', 'promote', 'next', 'match.Sneaking', 'off', 'best', 'friend', 'Pash', 'Alia', 'Shawkat', 'Bliss', 'totally', 'taken', 'whole', 'scene', 'match', 'place', 'converted', 'warehouse', 'where', 'emcee', 'Johnny', 'Rocket', 'Jimmy', 'Fallon', 'girls', 'make', 'way', 'track', 'names', 'Iron', 'Maven', 'Smashly', 'Simpson', 'Maggie', 'Mayhem', 'can', 'tell', 'skate', 'park', 'girls', 'come', 'out', 'rocking', 'knocking', 'making', 'impression', 'young', 'Bliss', 'When', 'Maggie', 'afterwards', 'new', 'hero', 'Maggie', 'come', 'practice', 'try', 'out.Once', 'home', 'Bliss', 'skating', 'once', 'more', 'Barbie', 'remnants', 'times', 'gone', 'just', 'being', 'able', 'stand', 'skating', 'town', 'day', 'sneaks', 'off', 'again', 'Austin', 'just', 'time', 'try', 'out', 'more', 'speed', 'most', 'rest', 'trying', 'out', 'Bliss', 'chance', 'Now', 'do', 'sneak', 'matches.The', 'girls', 'welcome', 'Bliss', 'one', 'Hurl', 'Scouts', 'losing', 'team', 'resolved', 'stay', 'last', 'place', 'speed', 'Bliss', 'ribbing', 'take', 'other', 'squads', 'team', 'slowly', 'gels', 'force', 'be', 'reckoned', 'also', 'Bliss', 'target', 'Iron', 'Maven', 'Juliette', 'Lewis', 'aging', 'star', 'who', 'retain', 'way', 'Bliss', 'also', 'up', 'new', 'boyfriend', 'Oliver', 'Landon', 'Pigg', 'member', 'band', 'played', 'one', 'house', 'parties', 'thrown', 'team', 'pair', 'connect', 'upcoming', 'tour', 'possibility', 'break', 'up.As', 'Bliss', 'now', 'known', 'Babe', 'Ruthless', 'world', 'roller', 'derby', 'distance', 'friends', 'when', 'parents', 'find', 'out', 'lies', 'team', 'when', 'revealed', 'too', 'young', 'skate', 'parent', 'permission', 'Bliss', 'alone.The', 'team', 'now', 'chance', 'finals', 'only', 'thing', 'stopping', 'happening', 'Bliss', 'family', 'Resigned', 'beauty', 'pageants', 'once', 'more', 'Bliss', 'out', 'new', 'contest', 'mother', 'favorite', 'same', 'night', 'big', 'contest', 'there', 'chance', 'making', 'Come', 'movie', 'folks', 'movie', 'believable', 'way', 'First', 'league', 'would', 'put', 'position', 'being', 'shut', 'down', 'due', 'teenager', 'not', 'being', 'old', 'enough', 'chances', 'walking', 'street', 'being', 'better', 'anyone', 'else', 'Slim', 'none', ""n't"", 'matter', 'What', 'feeling', 'sense', 'hope', 'Bliss', 'opportunity', 'move', 'life', 'one', 'finding', 'one', 'thing', 'life', 'feel', 'more', 'ever', 'before.The', 'acting', 'film', 'solid', 'especially', 'Ellen', 'Page', 'Changing', 'shy', 'Bliss', 'who', 'contests', 'mothers', 'request', 'becoming', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'own', 'decisions', 'fleshed', 'out', 'performance', 'Page', 'done', 'great', 'job', 'various', 'roles', 'films', 'JUNO', 'HARD', 'CANDY', 'even', 'X-MEN', ""'m"", 'beginning', 'think', 'one', 'best', 'actresses', 'days.The', 'supporting', 'cast', 'also', 'great', 'job', 'Barrymore', 'small', 'part', 'one', 'derby', 'girls', 'singer', 'Eve', 'stuntwoman', 'Zoe', 'Bell', 'one', 'who', 'stood', 'out', 'was', 'Kristen', 'Wiig', 'Maggie', 'Mayhem', 'Wiig', 'one', 'series', 'SATURDAY', 'NIGHT', 'LIVE', 'days', 'what', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'far', 'too', 'top', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'when', 'given', 'right', 'director', 'great', 'performance', 'single', 'mom', 'skater', 'who', 'surrogate', 'mom', 'Bliss.Barrymore', 'first', 'outing', 'director', 'can', 'put', 'together', 'well', 'made', 'film', 'entertaining', 'fun', 'delivers', 'everything', 'previews', 'said', 'would', 'said', ""n't"", 'Oscar', 'material', 'fun', 'film', 'Predictable', 'times', 'less', 'end', 'result', 'more', 'path', 'taken', 'get', 'there', 'movies', 'work', 'fail', 'case', 'movie', 'So', 'take', 'couple', 'track', 'give', 'one', 'look']",Whip It

DelParto ""Rose2""","[1, 2]","Whip It is a coming of age film that resonates nostalgia for those who remember watching the Roller Derby on television on any given Saturday depicting that knock em sock em attitude of raunchy women's sports on wheels, that is roller skates.  Although this is not a period film, the sight and sounds of yesteryear lurk in the background and foreground.  From the sounds of the Ramones to the style and dress of mix and match costumes that blares the late 1970s and early 1980s, especially with the characters in the film, roller derby announcer ""Hot Tub"" Johnny Rocket (Jimmy Fallon) and Girl Scout coach Razor (Andrew Wilson).  Drew Barrymore directs and plays Smashley Simpson of the fictitious roller derby team the Girl Scouts in this enticing film that focuses on the ups and downs of adolescent life through the eyes of Bliss Cavendar (Ellen Page).Bliss experiences the demands and growing pains of a 17 year-old who has too much on her plate.  She attends high school and works a part-time job as a waitress at the local Oink Joint BBQ diner by day and plays a 22 year-old fellow roller derby Girl Scout ""Babe Ruthless"" by night, and makes the excuse to her parents that she is taking a prep session for the SAT.  The film follows two premises, the fast paced and high rolling skate ramp scenes and camaraderie between teammates and Bliss's relationship with her overprotective and conservative parents Brooke and Earl Cavendar played by Marcia Gay Harden and Daniel Stern.  With the overbearing expectations at home, Bliss attempts to provide a buffer within her life between the various beauty pageants, such as the Blue Bonnet Pageant, and school and work by participating in her roller derby endeavors.  And to top that off, a budding romance quickly evolves between Bliss and Oliver, the leader of a band called Turbo Fruits, that becomes serious to the extent of the two trading shirts, Bliss's Stryper t-shirt for Oliver's green army jacket, to express their loyalty towards one another; one may say it is one of those ""aw shucks"" type of moments in the film.Overall, Whip It is a fun and exciting and spells ""pop culture"" throughout the film.

In Bliss Cavendar's (Ellen Page of ""Juno"") those wheels are a pair of roller skates.When we first see young Bliss, she's competing in the Bluebonnet Pageant at the direction of her Mom (Marcia Gay Harden). Bliss has got some pretty big shoes to fill since Mom won and her little sister seems to be destined to go all the way in pageantland.But, tiaras and talent contests aren't really what Bliss is about.  A shopping trip to Austin, TX changes her life when she meets a bunch of roller derby girls.  She's invited to try out and lies about her age (she has to be 21) to do so.  Even on her old Barbie skates, she's fast enough to make it.And Babe Ruthless is born.  Timid at first, Bliss gradually gets in the groove.  Big surprise, her team The Hurl Scouts is no longer settling for losing the game.  There's a lot of humor and heart in this story and many of us are seeing a sport that we don't often encounter in a way that changes a lot of perspectives on it and the young women who engage in it.Shauna Cross's YA novel bearing the same name translated really well into a great young adult film capable of following in ""Juno's"" very large shoes.

1295944,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B002VPTJNQ,RMurray847,"[3, 4]","WHIP IT is a great example of how perfect casting and an infectious enthusiasm can overcome a many problems in a film.  In the case of Drew Barrymore's directorial debut, those problems are primarily an exceedingly predictable plot and occasional sketchy characterizations.The star of the show is Ellen Page as a highschooler nearing graduation with no idea what she wants to do to get out of her depressing Texas small-town.  For years, her mother (Marcia Gay Harden) has dragged her through the beauty pageant circuit, but it's clear that Page takes NO joy in it.  She works at a diner with her best friend (""Arrested Development's"" Alia Shawkat...and is mostly  just shuffling through life.  One day, she finds a flyer advertising a roller derby taking place in the city...and she decides to go.  Clearly, something has struck her interest...and when she sees what the game is all about, a fire is lit within her.  She tries out for the team, makes it, and naturally, becomes a bit of a sensation.  Will her team rise from last place to a season-ending confrontation with their bitter rivals?  Will her mother eventually discover her secret and be deeply hurt by it?  Will there be some romance, some laughter and some tears?What do you think?But director Barrymore has been blessed with a stellar cast.  First of all, she has cast herself in a minor role as a roller girl.  Barrymore herself is one of the more charming and infectious performers around.  She is not so much a great ACTOR as she is an engaging person to spend two hours with.  It would seem that her own personality infused everyone in the film.  Her filming of the action sequences is hardly earth-shattering, and sometimes the pacing of the story flags a little bitEllen Page, playing sassy, wry but not nearly as smart as JUNO...seems somewhat liberated by this crazy role, which allows her to skate a lot, kick some butt and essentially play a hero that's right in her comfort zone.  She is a wonderful actor, and while WHIP IT is a film of modest ambition...she still manages to elevate it by her very presence.But almost everyone else is strong as well.  Marcia Gay Harden works well, because her character is the one that seems sapped of energy and excitement.  She is the mother who clearly had bigger dreams for herself than what her life delivered (another clich&eacute;) and she lives vicariously through the accomplishments of her daughters (another clich&eacute;).  Harden has always been good at this kind of attitude...although it's rare to see her in a lower-middle-class role...but she keeps it simple and believable.  Daniel Stern plays her husband...it feels like years since I've seen him in anything, and I really liked him as the ""good-ole-boy"" father...a man who doesn't really understand the women in his life, but isn't afraid to let them know he loves them unconditionally, and that he's there for them when the going gets tough.Shawkat is loads of fun as Page's best friend.  And the roller derby team itself is filled with wacky characters...but Kristen Wiig (who, on ""Saturday Night Live"" can play some deeply unlikable and disturbing characters) shines as a relatively normal single-mom who offers some words of wisdom to Page at a key moment (another clich&eacute;).  She gives a grounded, generous performance.  I've really come to like her in movies...where frequently on SNL she is simply off-putting.  Zo Bell (the great stuntwoman from Tarantino's DEATH PROOF) simply bursts with energy.  And the frightening looking Juliette Lewis plays the ""villain"" of the other team...but even she finds a few new things to bring to an essentially cardboard character.So we've got lots of cookie-cutter characters doing many predictable things.  Yet it all works remarkably well because the cast if fully invested in making WHIP IT a blast.  I went in hoping to have a good time, and I left not the least disappointed.  It put a smile on my face almost immediately, and it mostly stayed there all evening.  That, quite frankly, is a very welcome accomplishment for Barrymore and company.",4,Great cast and energy overcome a pile of cliches,1255478400,"10 14, 2009",2009,4080,"['IT', 'great', 'example', 'how', 'perfect', 'casting', 'infectious', 'enthusiasm', 'can', 'overcome', 'many', 'problems', 'film', 'case', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'directorial', 'debut', 'problems', 'are', 'primarily', 'exceedingly', 'predictable', 'plot', 'occasional', 'sketchy', 'characterizations.The', 'star', 'show', 'Ellen', 'Page', 'highschooler', 'nearing', 'graduation', 'idea', 'what', 'do', 'get', 'depressing', 'Texas', 'small-town', 'years', 'mother', 'Marcia', 'Gay', 'Harden', 'dragged', 'beauty', 'pageant', 'circuit', 'clear', 'Page', 'NO', 'joy', 'diner', 'best', 'friend', 'Arrested', 'Development', 'Alia', 'Shawkat', 'mostly', 'just', 'shuffling', 'life', 'One', 'day', 'flyer', 'advertising', 'roller', 'derby', 'taking', 'place', 'city', 'go', 'Clearly', 'something', 'struck', 'interest', 'when', 'what', 'game', 'about', 'fire', 'lit', 'out', 'team', 'naturally', 'bit', 'sensation', 'Will', 'team', 'rise', 'last', 'place', 'season-ending', 'confrontation', 'bitter', 'rivals', 'Will', 'mother', 'eventually', 'secret', 'be', 'deeply', 'hurt', 'Will', 'there', 'be', 'romance', 'laughter', 'tears', 'What', 'do', 'think', 'director', 'Barrymore', 'been', 'blessed', 'stellar', 'cast', 'First', 'all', 'cast', 'minor', 'role', 'roller', 'girl', 'one', 'more', 'charming', 'infectious', 'performers', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'great', 'ACTOR', 'engaging', 'person', 'spend', 'two', 'hours', 'would', 'seem', 'own', 'personality', 'infused', 'everyone', 'film', 'filming', 'action', 'sequences', 'hardly', 'earth-shattering', 'sometimes', 'pacing', 'story', 'little', 'bitEllen', 'Page', 'playing', 'sassy', 'wry', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'smart', 'JUNO', 'somewhat', 'liberated', 'crazy', 'role', 'skate', 'lot', 'kick', 'butt', 'essentially', 'play', 'hero', 'right', 'comfort', 'zone', 'wonderful', 'actor', 'WHIP', 'IT', 'film', 'modest', 'ambition', 'still', 'elevate', 'very', 'presence.But', 'almost', 'everyone', 'else', 'strong', 'as', 'well', 'Marcia', 'Gay', 'Harden', 'well', 'character', 'one', 'sapped', 'energy', 'excitement', 'mother', 'who', 'clearly', 'had', 'bigger', 'dreams', 'herself', 'what', 'life', 'delivered', 'clich', 'eacute', 'vicariously', 'accomplishments', 'daughters', 'clich', 'eacute', 'Harden', 'always', 'been', 'good', 'kind', 'attitude', 'rare', 'see', 'lower-middle-class', 'role', 'simple', 'believable', 'Daniel', 'Stern', 'husband', 'years', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'anything', 'really', 'liked', 'good-ole-boy', 'father', 'man', 'who', ""n't"", 'really', 'understand', 'women', 'life', ""n't"", 'afraid', 'let', 'know', 'unconditionally', 'there', 'when', 'going', 'tough.Shawkat', 'loads', 'fun', 'Page', 'best', 'friend', 'roller', 'derby', 'team', 'filled', 'wacky', 'characters', 'Kristen', 'Wiig', 'who', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Live', 'can', 'play', 'deeply', 'unlikable', 'disturbing', 'characters', 'shines', 'relatively', 'normal', 'single-mom', 'who', 'words', 'wisdom', 'Page', 'key', 'moment', 'clich', 'eacute', 'grounded', 'generous', 'performance', ""'ve"", 'really', 'come', 'movies', 'where', 'frequently', 'SNL', 'simply', 'off-putting', 'Zo', 'Bell', 'great', 'stuntwoman', 'Tarantino', 'DEATH', 'PROOF', 'simply', 'energy', 'frightening', 'looking', 'Juliette', 'Lewis', 'villain', 'other', 'team', 'even', 'few', 'new', 'things', 'bring', 'essentially', 'cardboard', 'character.So', ""'ve"", 'got', 'lots', 'cookie-cutter', 'characters', 'doing', 'many', 'predictable', 'things', 'remarkably', 'well', 'cast', 'fully', 'invested', 'making', 'WHIP', 'IT', 'blast', 'went', 'hoping', 'have', 'good', 'time', 'left', 'not', 'least', 'disappointed', 'put', 'smile', 'face', 'almost', 'immediately', 'mostly', 'stayed', 'evening', 'quite', 'frankly', 'very', 'welcome', 'accomplishment', 'Barrymore', 'company']",Whip It

Then everything gets turned upside down when she finds and joins a roller derby team and a love interest in the guise of a guitarist in a local band. Before long she is breaking out of her shell, as well as breaking some heads as she whips her way round the derby ring. She finds an alternative, outlandish family in her team mates and has to balance her mums aspirations for her and her own dreams in life.Ellen Page is excellent as Bliss and all of her team mates are superb as alternative, fun loving girls with heart. Barrymore is hilarious in the side role she plays, as is the feisty Juliette Lewis and all of the `stage names' the girls take on will crack you up.

1295959,A268EEWUXYCA8Q,B002VPTJNQ,Terry Mesnard,"[5, 6]","Based on a the novel Derby Girl by Shauna Cross (who also wrote the screenplay), Whip It is a funny little film about a little known sport called roller derby.  I remember the first time I saw a roller derby match and was stunned at both how physical the sport was and how mesmerizing it could be; it is as exhilerating and thrilling as any other mainstream sport.  Whip It does a good job of capturing the same thrill and feeling of a roller derby match by spinning a mostly cliched coming-of-age story to wrap it together.Bliss Cavendar (Ellen Page) is a rebellious teen living in a too-small-for-her town of Bodeen, Texas.  Her overbearing but very loving mother wants nothing but to have her daughter be a beauty pageant queen like she was in her younger years.  Of course, the blue-haired Bliss wants nothing to do with it.  When, on a trip to Austin, she discovers a pamphlet about a roller derby match, decides to check it out and inadvertently tries out for and is selected to be on a losing roller derby team.  With the help from her teammates, including the awesome Kristen Wiig as Maggie Mayhem (who shares a name with the writer's roller derby name), Bliss learns to ""become her own hero,"" and basically grow up into the person she wants to be.Mostly, the story in Whip It is the same as any other coming-of-age story, where the young adult ends up learning about theirselves, their family and life in general.  Add into it a love interest and some ""life lessons,"" and you basically have every other growing up story in Hollywood.  The biggest difference here is both the writing which is usually very funny and good and some great performances.  Whip It, Drew Barrymore's first directorial effort, has a great supporting cast (Marcia Gay Harden, Daniel Stern, Juliette Lewis, Zoe Bell and an almost unrecognizable-except-for-his-smile Jimmy Fallon) who really fill out the characters.  It's also nice to see a strong, mostly female cast that has a good message and isn't stereotypically catty.  It's easy to overlook the sometimes cliched plot because Whip It really does a great job in breaking down stereotypes by painting a pretty accurate and heartfelt portrayal of the sport and the strong women who play it.",4,"Very funny, if sometimes cliched, coming-of-age story",1254182400,"09 29, 2009",2009,2226,"['Based', 'novel', 'Derby', 'Girl', 'Shauna', 'Cross', 'who', 'also', 'wrote', 'screenplay', 'Whip', 'funny', 'little', 'film', 'little', 'known', 'sport', 'called', 'roller', 'derby', 'remember', 'first', 'time', 'saw', 'roller', 'derby', 'match', 'was', 'stunned', 'how', 'physical', 'sport', 'was', 'how', 'mesmerizing', 'could', 'be', 'exhilerating', 'thrilling', 'other', 'mainstream', 'sport', 'good', 'job', 'capturing', 'same', 'thrill', 'feeling', 'roller', 'derby', 'match', 'spinning', 'mostly', 'cliched', 'coming-of-age', 'story', 'wrap', 'together.Bliss', 'Cavendar', 'Ellen', 'Page', 'rebellious', 'teen', 'living', 'too-small-for-her', 'town', 'Bodeen', 'Texas', 'overbearing', 'very', 'loving', 'mother', 'nothing', 'have', 'daughter', 'be', 'beauty', 'pageant', 'queen', 'was', 'younger', 'years', 'course', 'blue-haired', 'Bliss', 'nothing', 'do', 'When', 'trip', 'Austin', 'pamphlet', 'roller', 'derby', 'match', 'check', 'out', 'inadvertently', 'out', 'selected', 'be', 'losing', 'roller', 'derby', 'team', 'help', 'teammates', 'including', 'awesome', 'Kristen', 'Wiig', 'Maggie', 'Mayhem', 'who', 'shares', 'name', 'writer', 'roller', 'derby', 'name', 'Bliss', 'become', 'own', 'hero', 'basically', 'grow', 'up', 'person', 'be.Mostly', 'story', 'Whip', 'same', 'other', 'coming-of-age', 'story', 'where', 'young', 'adult', 'up', 'learning', 'theirselves', 'family', 'life', 'general', 'Add', 'love', 'interest', 'life', 'lessons', 'basically', 'have', 'other', 'growing', 'up', 'story', 'Hollywood', 'biggest', 'difference', 'here', 'writing', 'usually', 'very', 'funny', 'good', 'great', 'performances', 'Whip', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'first', 'directorial', 'effort', 'great', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Marcia', 'Gay', 'Harden', 'Daniel', 'Stern', 'Juliette', 'Lewis', 'Zoe', 'Bell', 'almost', 'unrecognizable-except-for-his-smile', 'Jimmy', 'Fallon', 'who', 'really', 'fill', 'out', 'characters', 'also', 'nice', 'see', 'strong', 'mostly', 'female', 'cast', 'good', 'message', ""n't"", 'stereotypically', 'catty', 'easy', 'overlook', 'sometimes', 'cliched', 'plot', 'Whip', 'really', 'great', 'job', 'breaking', 'down', 'stereotypes', 'painting', 'pretty', 'accurate', 'heartfelt', 'portrayal', 'sport', 'strong', 'women', 'who', 'play']",Whip It

The plot of the movie is very typical: girl's life is planned by parent/parents; girl rebels and finds own path; conflict with parent ensues; compromise occurs and then happy ending for everyone.  The execution of this plot, however, and its handling of character development, is what really makes the movie enjoyable.  In fact, I would say that in a few years it will probably be considered a cult classic.Ellen Page is a very capable young actress.  And although she is in danger of being typecast for her snarky attitude, her character in Whip It is not nearly as sardonic and cynical as it was in Juno, which is a pleasant change.The rest of the characters are well-cast, too, but her rollerball team is largely comprised of charicature performances, since the movie isn't really long enough to let each girl have her own fully fleshed out character and story.The first ten to fifteen minutes of the movie are a bit slow, but once it gets going it's a fun ride.  The roller derby scenes are exciting and hilarious, and it's one of the only ""sports"" movies where I actually care about the character who is trying to win.This is a rare movie that succeeds as a comedy, as a drama, and as a sports movie.

The tattooed derby girl answers, ""Come to the tryout - be your own hero."" And she does.The rest follows an inspiring and hilarious season of sneaking around the parents, doing her part to bring the last-place team to the championship. As you might expect, the poo hits the fan when pageant-panicked Mom finds out that her little beauty queen has another life as Babe Ruthless. I found the parent/teen flareups somewhat milder than realistic, but then the rapprochement was unconvincingly minor, too.But, if that tension had been much tenser, a lot of the movie's core fun would have been hidden. Barrymore, in her debut role as director, clearly had fun making this and the fun comes through in the final product. The girl-power, be-who-you-are messages come through without shrillness, and Page's navigation of teen heartbreak leaves her character convincingly in the lead. One scene near the very end, her father with hammer in hand (wait for it) was a bit predictable, but satisfying none the less. As was the whole movie. I don't always want a movie that takes itself too seriously. When you want a fun bit of fluff with plenty of physical comedy, give this one a shot. It's well worth the time spent seeing it.-- wiredweird",4,Whip it good!,1329436800,"02 17, 2012",2012,1850,"['official', 'further', 'notice', 'will', 'happily', 'see', 'movie', 'featuring', 'Ellen', 'Page', 'previous', 'movies', 'Page', 'outstanding', 'job', 'bringing', 'angsty', 'teenage', 'character', 'life', 'time', 'slightly', 'lost', 'seventeen', 'year', 'old', 'being', 'herded', 'pageant-passionate', 'mother', 'first', 'glimmering', 'might', 'have', 'goals', 'own', 'when', 'roller', 'derby', 'girls', 'dropping', 'off', 'flyers', 'upcoming', 'event', 'course', 'out', 'see', 'using', 'pretext', 'transparent', 'everyone', 'parents', 'transfixed', 'show', 'one', 'skaters', 'guys', 'are', 'heroes', 'tattooed', 'derby', 'girl', 'answers', 'Come', 'tryout', 'be', 'own', 'hero', 'rest', 'inspiring', 'hilarious', 'season', 'sneaking', 'parents', 'doing', 'part', 'bring', 'last-place', 'team', 'championship', 'might', 'expect', 'poo', 'fan', 'when', 'pageant-panicked', 'Mom', 'out', 'little', 'beauty', 'queen', 'life', 'Babe', 'Ruthless', 'found', 'parent/teen', 'flareups', 'somewhat', 'milder', 'realistic', 'then', 'rapprochement', 'was', 'unconvincingly', 'minor', 'too.But', 'tension', 'had', 'been', 'much', 'tenser', 'lot', 'movie', 'core', 'fun', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'hidden', 'Barrymore', 'debut', 'role', 'director', 'clearly', 'had', 'fun', 'making', 'fun', 'final', 'product', 'girl-power', 'be-who-you-are', 'messages', 'come', 'shrillness', 'Page', 'navigation', 'teen', 'heartbreak', 'character', 'convincingly', 'lead', 'One', 'scene', 'very', 'end', 'father', 'hammer', 'hand', 'wait', 'was', 'bit', 'predictable', 'satisfying', 'none', 'less', 'was', 'whole', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'always', 'want', 'movie', 'too', 'seriously', 'When', 'want', 'fun', 'bit', 'fluff', 'plenty', 'physical', 'comedy', 'give', 'one', 'shot', 'well', 'time', 'spent', 'seeing', 'it.', 'wiredweird']",Whip It
1295969,A3O536E2YOKK4Y,B002VPTJNQ,Wuchak,"[1, 1]","Released in 2009, ""Whip It"" was Drew Barrymore's first and (so far) only full-length film in the director's chair. Drew also co-stars, but she's a side character and non-essential to the plot.The story revolves around 17 year-old Bliss Cavendar (Ellen Page), her parents (Daniel Stern & Marcia Gay Harden) and her best friend, Pash (Alia Shawkat). Bliss is involved in the world of beauty pageants due to her mother's obsession, but becomes fascinated by a group of roller derby girls while visiting nearby Austin, TX. She decides to try-out for the the Hurl Scouts.""Whip It"" starts out slow and only mildly interesting but it ultimately won me over. This is basically a coming-of-age drama using the roller derby as a backdrop and stage. Since Ellen Page takes center focus, and does a great job, ""Whip It"" should appeal to fans of Page. I'm not a fan; I can take her or leave her. Thankfully, there's enough good here to draw in other folks.I especially like the roller derby girls and their camaraderie & competition. The girls include Juliette Lewis, Kristen Wiig, Eve, Zoe Bell, Ari Graynor, Eli Bleiler and Sydney Bennett. What I love about these women is that they have womanly curves and aren't walking sticks with big breasts. Take, for instance, the so-called Manson Sisters, played by Kristen Adolfi & Rachel Piplica; both are just jaw-droppingly gorgeous throughout the film and worth the price of admission -- stunning examples of womanhood.There's a subplot about Bliss falling for a guy in a rock band (Landon Pigg) and there are other characters, like the coach, the derby announcer and the Hispanic manager of the restaurant Bliss & Pash work at (Andrew Wilson, Jimmy Fallon and Carlo Alban respectively), but this is mainly about Bliss, her family, Pash and the derby girls.FINAL SAY: The drama in this coming-of-age flick is a mixed bag; I found the love story kind of tedious but enjoyed Pash and the family dynamics of the Cavendar household. The best part, of course, is the derby action and the ravishing derby babes in all their glory.The film runs 111 minutes and was mostly filmed in Michigan with some shots of Austin, TX.GRADE: B",4,Coming of age with the roller derby girls,1376352000,"08 13, 2013",2013,2157,"['Released', '2009', 'Whip', 'was', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'first', 'so', 'far', 'only', 'full-length', 'film', 'director', 'chair', 'Drew', 'also', 'co-stars', 'side', 'character', 'non-essential', 'plot.The', 'story', 'revolves', '17', 'year-old', 'Bliss', 'Cavendar', 'Ellen', 'Page', 'parents', 'Daniel', 'Stern', 'Marcia', 'Gay', 'Harden', 'best', 'friend', 'Pash', 'Alia', 'Shawkat', 'Bliss', 'involved', 'world', 'beauty', 'pageants', 'due', 'mother', 'obsession', 'becomes', 'fascinated', 'group', 'roller', 'derby', 'girls', 'visiting', 'nearby', 'Austin', 'TX', 'try-out', 'Hurl', 'Scouts', 'Whip', 'out', 'slow', 'only', 'mildly', 'interesting', 'ultimately', 'won', 'over', 'basically', 'coming-of-age', 'drama', 'using', 'roller', 'derby', 'backdrop', 'stage', 'Ellen', 'Page', 'center', 'focus', 'great', 'job', 'Whip', 'should', 'appeal', 'fans', 'Page', ""'m"", 'not', 'fan', 'can', 'take', 'leave', 'Thankfully', 'enough', 'good', 'here', 'draw', 'other', 'folks.I', 'especially', 'roller', 'derby', 'girls', 'camaraderie', 'competition', 'girls', 'include', 'Juliette', 'Lewis', 'Kristen', 'Wiig', 'Eve', 'Zoe', 'Bell', 'Ari', 'Graynor', 'Eli', 'Bleiler', 'Sydney', 'Bennett', 'What', 'love', 'women', 'have', 'womanly', 'curves', 'are', ""n't"", 'walking', 'sticks', 'big', 'breasts', 'Take', 'instance', 'so-called', 'Manson', 'Sisters', 'played', 'Kristen', 'Adolfi', 'Rachel', 'Piplica', 'are', 'just', 'jaw-droppingly', 'gorgeous', 'film', 'price', 'admission', 'stunning', 'examples', 'subplot', 'Bliss', 'falling', 'guy', 'rock', 'band', 'Landon', 'Pigg', 'are', 'other', 'characters', 'coach', 'derby', 'announcer', 'Hispanic', 'manager', 'restaurant', 'Bliss', 'Pash', 'work', 'Andrew', 'Wilson', 'Jimmy', 'Fallon', 'Carlo', 'Alban', 'respectively', 'mainly', 'Bliss', 'family', 'Pash', 'derby', 'girls.FINAL', 'SAY', 'drama', 'coming-of-age', 'flick', 'mixed', 'bag', 'found', 'love', 'story', 'kind', 'tedious', 'enjoyed', 'Pash', 'family', 'dynamics', 'Cavendar', 'household', 'best', 'part', 'course', 'derby', 'action', 'ravishing', 'derby', 'babes', 'glory.The', 'film', '111', 'minutes', 'was', 'mostly', 'filmed', 'Michigan', 'shots', 'Austin', 'TX.GRADE', 'B']",Whip It
