942869,A36JO8IHKYBMMJ,B000BITUX4,Bart Motes,"[0, 0]","From an ugly palette of ghetto life--pimping, dealing, and violence--writer-director Craig Brewer, star Terrence Dashon Howard, and the talented supporting cast have created a compelling and often beautiful portrait of desperation and hope. The product is not a film that glorifies pimping, that degrades women, or even that glamorizes rap music. Instead, it is an archetypal story of trying to make it against all odds. This has led to critics sneering at Hustle & Flow's cliched storyline, but the sneers are too quick and misguided. The story arc may be conventional, but it's the boldness of the vision as a whole--capturing the truth of Memphis and DJay's life--and plotting it out with the necessary commercial compromises to make it happen. The film deserves more than knee-jerk dismissal on grounds of being a retread, portraying blacks poorly, or being evil towards women. These criticisms can be briefly addressed. Quick name all the movies that deal with a sensitive pimp trying to get out of poverty. As far as the portrayal of blacks, there are a number of very positive portrayals, from the character of the producer Keith, to the choir singer who inspires DJay, even the bar owner who encourages DJay. And ultimately, it's a movie about a pimp. It's hard to have a strong female character in a movie about a pimp. But note that Shug provides the hook for DJay's song and Nola is crucial too.This dirty-beautiful movie should not be prejudged, it should be savored. It has something to say to anyone who has a dream and is trying to make it. Very compelling and far too short.Quick facts:--Craig Brewer's wife worked as a stripper for two years.--Terrence Howard says he doesn't like rap music because it is violent and he doesn't listen to it or allow his children to listen to it.--The executive producer of the film is a woman.",5,Dirty-beautiful,1123545600,"08 9, 2005",2005,1844,"['ugly', 'palette', 'ghetto', 'life', 'pimping', 'dealing', 'violence', 'writer-director', 'Craig', 'Brewer', 'star', 'Terrence', 'Dashon', 'Howard', 'talented', 'supporting', 'cast', 'have', 'created', 'compelling', 'often', 'beautiful', 'portrait', 'desperation', 'hope', 'product', 'not', 'film', 'pimping', 'women', 'even', 'rap', 'music', 'Instead', 'archetypal', 'story', 'trying', 'make', 'odds', 'led', 'critics', 'sneering', 'Hustle', 'Flow', 'cliched', 'storyline', 'sneers', 'are', 'too', 'quick', 'misguided', 'story', 'arc', 'may', 'be', 'conventional', 'boldness', 'vision', 'whole', 'capturing', 'truth', 'Memphis', 'DJay', 'life', 'plotting', 'necessary', 'commercial', 'compromises', 'make', 'happen', 'film', 'more', 'knee-jerk', 'dismissal', 'grounds', 'being', 'retread', 'portraying', 'blacks', 'poorly', 'being', 'evil', 'towards', 'women', 'criticisms', 'can', 'be', 'briefly', 'addressed', 'Quick', 'name', 'movies', 'deal', 'sensitive', 'pimp', 'trying', 'get', 'poverty', 'As', 'far', 'portrayal', 'blacks', 'are', 'number', 'very', 'positive', 'portrayals', 'character', 'producer', 'Keith', 'choir', 'singer', 'who', 'DJay', 'even', 'bar', 'owner', 'who', 'DJay', 'ultimately', 'movie', 'pimp', 'hard', 'have', 'strong', 'female', 'character', 'movie', 'pimp', 'note', 'Shug', 'hook', 'DJay', 'song', 'Nola', 'crucial', 'too.This', 'dirty-beautiful', 'movie', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'prejudged', 'should', 'be', 'savored', 'something', 'say', 'anyone', 'who', 'dream', 'trying', 'make', 'Very', 'compelling', 'far', 'too', 'short.Quick', 'facts', 'Craig', 'Brewer', 'wife', 'worked', 'stripper', 'two', 'years.', 'Terrence', 'Howard', ""n't"", 'like', 'rap', 'music', 'violent', ""n't"", 'listen', 'allow', 'children', 'listen', 'it.', 'executive', 'producer', 'film', 'woman']",Hustle & Flow

Terrence Howard is terrific as DJay, a Memphis pimp with a dream of recording a rap demo. The supporting cast is really strong. The movie has one of the best screenplays I've seen in a while, too.

942871,A3BEF4IHWI0VC,B000BITUX4,Chris Luallen,"[7, 9]","This movie does several things really well. First of all, the acting is excellent, especially Terence Howard. Also the film has a raw and gritty quality in its portrait of Memphis street life. Finally, the story moves along at rapid pace. I was not bored by this movie.However, where the movie goes wrong is in its attempt to turn DJay into some sort of ""up from the gutter"" hero along the lines of the ""Rocky"" movies. DJay does have some good qualities. But the bottom line is that he is a pimp, a man he makes his living off the abuse and exploitation of women. In another incident, DJay throws his toddler-age son out of the house after having an argument with the mother - an unforgivable action. Finally, in the movie's climax, DJ pistol whips and possibly kills Skinny B, a more famous rapper that DJay was hoping would help him out, for throwing his tape in the toilet while in a drunken stupor. DJay does have his dream of becoming a rap star. But where the movie becomes absurd is in its depiction of DJay finding meaning in his life through the discovery of his ""artistic voice."" So-called ""gangster rap"" was at least new and provocative, though still sexist and violent, when NWA and others first came out around 15 years ago. But this music genre has been done to death and DJay is adding nothing new with songs like ""Whup That Trick"". He's only looking to become rich and famous rather than having to find a real job like the rest of us.I am all for ""keeping it real"" and if this movie was intended only as an accurate depiction of the life of a Memphis street hustler wanna-be rapper then I would say it was successful. But instead they try to show DJay as a heroic charcter struggling to achieve his dream. DJay is actually a tragedy rather than a hero and for that reason the movie fails.But what bothered me more than the movie itself was reading a review by the famous critic Roger Ebert. Ebert goes on at great length about how DJay is a victim of his circumstances who in another life might be running for Congress. To me this shows a huge disrespect to all the people out there, African-American and otherwise, who have come up from a difficult background. But still manage to be decent and responsible citizens who work hard and support their families. My wife grew up with 13 siblings in the country of Ecuador, living in worse poverty than most Americans can even imagine. But she choose to do something better with her life than become a criminal. DJay lives like he does not because he is a ""victim."" But because he has made wrong decisions in his life. There is nothing cool or heroic about being a pimp. But this movie, along with other aspects of popular culture, continue to glorify it as an exciting alternative to the real world. We have to do better!",2,DJay is not a hero,1122249600,"07 25, 2005",2005,2783,"['movie', 'several', 'things', 'really', 'well', 'First', 'all', 'acting', 'excellent', 'especially', 'Terence', 'Howard', 'Also', 'film', 'raw', 'gritty', 'quality', 'portrait', 'Memphis', 'street', 'life', 'Finally', 'story', 'along', 'rapid', 'pace', 'was', 'not', 'bored', 'movie.However', 'where', 'movie', 'wrong', 'attempt', 'turn', 'DJay', 'sort', 'gutter', 'hero', 'lines', 'Rocky', 'movies', 'DJay', 'have', 'good', 'qualities', 'bottom', 'line', 'pimp', 'man', 'living', 'off', 'abuse', 'exploitation', 'women', 'incident', 'DJay', 'toddler-age', 'son', 'house', 'having', 'argument', 'mother', 'unforgivable', 'action', 'Finally', 'movie', 'climax', 'DJ', 'whips', 'possibly', 'kills', 'Skinny', 'B', 'more', 'famous', 'rapper', 'DJay', 'was', 'hoping', 'would', 'help', 'out', 'throwing', 'tape', 'toilet', 'drunken', 'stupor', 'DJay', 'have', 'dream', 'becoming', 'rap', 'star', 'where', 'movie', 'absurd', 'depiction', 'DJay', 'finding', 'meaning', 'life', 'discovery', 'artistic', 'voice', 'So-called', 'gangster', 'rap', 'was', 'least', 'new', 'provocative', 'still', 'sexist', 'violent', 'when', 'NWA', 'others', 'first', 'came', 'out', '15', 'years', 'ago', 'music', 'genre', 'been', 'done', 'death', 'DJay', 'adding', 'nothing', 'new', 'songs', 'Whup', 'Trick', 'only', 'looking', 'become', 'rich', 'famous', 'rather', 'having', 'find', 'real', 'job', 'rest', 'us.I', 'am', 'keeping', 'real', 'movie', 'was', 'intended', 'only', 'accurate', 'depiction', 'life', 'Memphis', 'street', 'hustler', 'wanna-be', 'rapper', 'then', 'would', 'say', 'was', 'successful', 'instead', 'try', 'show', 'DJay', 'heroic', 'charcter', 'struggling', 'achieve', 'dream', 'DJay', 'actually', 'tragedy', 'rather', 'hero', 'reason', 'movie', 'what', 'bothered', 'more', 'movie', 'was', 'reading', 'review', 'famous', 'critic', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'Ebert', 'great', 'length', 'how', 'DJay', 'victim', 'circumstances', 'who', 'life', 'might', 'be', 'running', 'Congress', 'huge', 'disrespect', 'people', 'there', 'African-American', 'otherwise', 'who', 'have', 'come', 'up', 'difficult', 'background', 'still', 'manage', 'be', 'decent', 'responsible', 'citizens', 'who', 'work', 'hard', 'support', 'families', 'wife', 'grew', 'up', '13', 'siblings', 'country', 'Ecuador', 'living', 'worse', 'poverty', 'most', 'Americans', 'can', 'even', 'imagine', 'choose', 'do', 'something', 'better', 'life', 'become', 'criminal', 'DJay', 'not', 'victim', 'made', 'wrong', 'decisions', 'life', 'nothing', 'cool', 'heroic', 'being', 'pimp', 'movie', 'other', 'aspects', 'popular', 'culture', 'continue', 'glorify', 'exciting', 'alternative', 'real', 'world', 'have', 'do', 'better']",Hustle & Flow

The film is gritty and in your face but very well directed, acted and filmed. The entire cast gives great performances although the movie ultimately belongs to Howard who is in practically every frame. He is sure to be nominated for an Oscar for best actor.Filmed in Memphis, the movie does not have one dishonest frame. While it may not be for the squeamish, the rest of us are glad we saw it. Oh, near the beginning of the film soprano Jennifer Byneum does a wonderful rendition of the spiritual ""Changed Mah Name.""

942874,AZ5WK99NSFNRV,B000BITUX4,"Justin Maldonado ""JM""","[3, 3]","Every dog has his day. So is true with most actors. Hustle & Flow is Terrence Howard's day.He plays DJay, a pimp going through a mid-life crisis. He's 35, and has nothing to show for his life. He lives in a house with no air conditioning along with a pregnant Shug (Taraji P. Henson), skinny white Nola (Taryn Manning), and ungrateful Lexus (Paula Jai Parker). He runs into an old school pal Clyde (a surprisingly good Anthony Anderson), and convinces him to help him record some tracks for a demo he's hoping to hand over to Skinny Black (Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges), a former school mate who is now a platinum rapper. By handing Skinny over the tape, DJay hopes he can make it big and finally leave behind his life of failure.Howard give an Oscar-nomination worthy performance in a role that requires a certain machismo yet a soul of pain and depth. He commands the screen with a power rarely seen.First time writer/director Craig Brewer gives us a story of inspiration, hope, persistence, courage, and passion.

942875,A6ADO7B6FUVN,B000BITUX4,"Kim Anehall ""www.cinematica.org""","[39, 52]","Memphis, Tennessee, is a location like any other where poverty and human struggle exist on any level.  Some, unfortunately, where born in rough situations while others might have been born with a gold spoon in their mouth.  Together with poverty ventures an undesirable travel companion known as criminality that spreads further dismay among the poor.  It does not necessarily mean that the poor are criminals, but through criminal activities youth often discover their chance to accomplish their materialistic dreams often induced from television.  The director Craig Brewer discloses his vision of a struggling pimp and drug dealer trying to find direction in his life while continue to hustle his business on others in Hustle & Flow.A lengthy introduction of the main character DJay (Terrence Dashon Howard) and his background opens Hustle & Flow, which intriguingly gives the audience an understanding for his situation.  It is obvious that DJay is a street smart and intelligent young man, as he in the initial scene gives an existential exposition on the nature of mankind related to his situation.  In the light of his philosophical notions one could understand why he is where he is in life, pimping and selling drugs in his neighborhood.  In addition, DJay does not get the feeling of satisfaction from his job, but it must be done as he seems to feel some form of responsibility to the women who work for him.  Instead DJay dreams of making music and rapping his lyrics, but has never taken the opportunity to try.DJay understands the simple functions of society, as people wish to themselves away from the poverty and never having to return to a life of poverty on any level whether it is a physical visit or through reminiscence.  The mindset of avoiding poverty sadly allows for very few, if ever any opportunities for the poor to get out of poverty.  However, an opportunity begins with a dream, which must be executed.  When DJay meets an old high school friend, Key (Anthony Anderson), he sees an opportunity, but Key is hesitant for the same reason many others are in regards to people in poverty.  Key gives DJay a lecture in walking the walk instead of talking the talk through which he wants DJay to understand to accomplish a dream requires much hard work.  DJay finds a way to convince Key that he intends to work hard in order to achieve his dream.Together DJay and Key begin to create a temporary home studio where they can record the music that they both love so much.  Key also brings in Shelby (DJ Qualls), a skinny guy from the church, who helps out creating a great sound to DJay's lyrics.  Much of the second act of the film revolves Key, Shelby, and DJay sitting in the studio trying to find the right sound and the right words to make a hit song.  In between rehearsals and musical exploration DJay finds himself pimping and selling drugs to raise the money to make his songs, but it is hard as he cannot raise much money.  Setbacks begin to affect DJay, and he must face his own demons through his insecurities and the fear of failing.  All aspects of DJay's life begin to affect his music making, but he must remain persistent, or he will fail.Hustle & Flow offers a truly terrific cinematic experience which deals with the notion of having dreams and hopes about the future.  Brewer takes this notion even one step further, as he explores the idea of fulfilling the dreams which requires a large amount of hard work.  Terrence Dashon Howard turns out to be the perfect actor for the part, as everything he does only makes the film better.  To understand the quality of talent that Howard possess, one should understand the vast number of characters that he has performed.  Recently, he was in Crash (2004) where he was a wonderful television producer and now comes across as a genuine pimp and drug dealer who has desires to becomes something else.",4,Everyone Has to Have Dreams...,1122163200,"07 24, 2005",2005,3883,"['Memphis', 'Tennessee', 'location', 'other', 'where', 'poverty', 'human', 'struggle', 'exist', 'level', 'unfortunately', 'where', 'born', 'rough', 'situations', 'others', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'born', 'gold', 'spoon', 'mouth', 'Together', 'poverty', 'ventures', 'undesirable', 'travel', 'companion', 'known', 'criminality', 'further', 'dismay', 'poor', 'not', 'necessarily', 'mean', 'poor', 'are', 'criminals', 'criminal', 'activities', 'youth', 'often', 'discover', 'chance', 'accomplish', 'materialistic', 'dreams', 'often', 'induced', 'television', 'director', 'Craig', 'Brewer', 'vision', 'struggling', 'pimp', 'drug', 'dealer', 'trying', 'find', 'direction', 'life', 'continue', 'hustle', 'business', 'others', 'Hustle', 'Flow.A', 'lengthy', 'introduction', 'main', 'character', 'DJay', 'Terrence', 'Dashon', 'Howard', 'background', 'Hustle', 'Flow', 'intriguingly', 'audience', 'understanding', 'situation', 'obvious', 'DJay', 'street', 'smart', 'intelligent', 'young', 'man', 'initial', 'scene', 'existential', 'exposition', 'nature', 'mankind', 'related', 'situation', 'light', 'philosophical', 'notions', 'one', 'could', 'understand', 'why', 'where', 'life', 'pimping', 'selling', 'drugs', 'neighborhood', 'addition', 'DJay', 'not', 'get', 'feeling', 'satisfaction', 'job', 'must', 'be', 'done', 'feel', 'form', 'responsibility', 'women', 'who', 'work', 'Instead', 'DJay', 'dreams', 'making', 'music', 'rapping', 'lyrics', 'never', 'taken', 'opportunity', 'try.DJay', 'understands', 'simple', 'functions', 'society', 'people', 'wish', 'away', 'poverty', 'never', 'having', 'return', 'life', 'poverty', 'level', 'physical', 'visit', 'reminiscence', 'mindset', 'avoiding', 'poverty', 'sadly', 'very', 'few', 'ever', 'opportunities', 'poor', 'get', 'poverty', 'However', 'opportunity', 'dream', 'must', 'be', 'executed', 'When', 'DJay', 'old', 'high', 'school', 'friend', 'Key', 'Anthony', 'Anderson', 'opportunity', 'Key', 'hesitant', 'same', 'reason', 'many', 'others', 'are', 'regards', 'people', 'poverty', 'Key', 'DJay', 'lecture', 'walking', 'walk', 'instead', 'talking', 'talk', 'DJay', 'understand', 'accomplish', 'dream', 'much', 'hard', 'work', 'DJay', 'way', 'convince', 'Key', 'work', 'hard', 'order', 'achieve', 'dream.Together', 'DJay', 'Key', 'begin', 'create', 'temporary', 'home', 'studio', 'where', 'can', 'record', 'music', 'love', 'so', 'much', 'Key', 'also', 'Shelby', 'DJ', 'Qualls', 'skinny', 'guy', 'church', 'who', 'out', 'creating', 'great', 'sound', 'DJay', 'lyrics', 'Much', 'second', 'act', 'film', 'Key', 'Shelby', 'DJay', 'sitting', 'studio', 'trying', 'find', 'right', 'sound', 'right', 'words', 'make', 'hit', 'song', 'rehearsals', 'musical', 'exploration', 'DJay', 'pimping', 'selling', 'drugs', 'raise', 'money', 'make', 'songs', 'hard', 'can', 'not', 'raise', 'much', 'money', 'Setbacks', 'begin', 'affect', 'DJay', 'must', 'face', 'own', 'demons', 'insecurities', 'fear', 'failing', 'aspects', 'DJay', 'life', 'begin', 'affect', 'music', 'making', 'must', 'remain', 'persistent', 'will', 'fail.Hustle', 'Flow', 'truly', 'terrific', 'cinematic', 'experience', 'notion', 'having', 'dreams', 'future', 'Brewer', 'notion', 'even', 'one', 'step', 'further', 'idea', 'fulfilling', 'dreams', 'large', 'amount', 'hard', 'work', 'Terrence', 'Dashon', 'Howard', 'out', 'be', 'perfect', 'actor', 'part', 'everything', 'only', 'film', 'better', 'understand', 'quality', 'talent', 'Howard', 'possess', 'one', 'should', 'understand', 'vast', 'number', 'characters', 'performed', 'Recently', 'was', 'Crash', '2004', 'where', 'was', 'wonderful', 'television', 'producer', 'now', 'across', 'genuine', 'pimp', 'drug', 'dealer', 'who', 'desires', 'becomes', 'something', 'else']",Hustle & Flow

I had no idea whether I'd like it or not because there was such an abundance of stereotypes, I didn't really think Terrance could pull off the accent, and the pimp lifestyle does not excite me.

He meets up with an old friend to produce tracks for him to later give to the rapper.  The viewers also meet his stable of women (a very entertaining and dramatically different bunch--an airhead, a down-for-the-cause, and a straight hood one--sometimes personalities switched) and the very amped and down to earth white beatmaker.  I'm mad I was bobbing my head to the song regardless of how female unfriendly it was, but hey, the beat was RIDICULOUS and Terrence blew me when he actually pulled off the accent and really looked like a legitimate rapper.

Indeed the viewer may initially feel antipathy towards Djay who employs head-games mixed with occasional threats of violence to motivate his ladies to hit ""the track"".  However, slowly over the course of the film we identify with DJay, the prostitutes and the other characters.  Like most of us, they were thrown into a certain set of life circumstances, a bad one in this case, and are doing their best to get on with it.Djay is suffering from a mid-life crisis (a term he uses) and dreams of becoming a rap artist.  To pursue this, he teams up with an old friend Key and an aquaintance of this latter, Shelby.These characters are also familiar to us.  Key does sound recording, albeit of a variety of venues, such as school board meetings. He has managed, with his store-clerk wife, to create a decent lower middle-class life for himself.  However, his work leaves him empty and he dreams of producing music.  Shelby-the lone white guy of the trio-is a keyboardist and mixer.  However, his day-time job consists of stocking vending machines.  So all of the group suffer from the same ennui as most of us in the industrialized world vis a' vis our work.  Djay's ""hoz"" suffer from the same and communicate the need to be recognized as worthy human beings.Together the three accompanied by one of Djay's women put together some great music, which is a boon on top of the great storyline.  A famous rapper ""Skinny Black"" is coming back to his old 'hood in Memphis to celebrate the 4th of July at a local bar.  Djay seizes this opportunity  to have Skinny listen to the groups recordings, in the hopes that the rapper will get some exposure for the music.  My synopsis stops there so as not to give away the movie.If ""American Beauty"" was the middle-class tale of post-modern disenchantment with the American Dream, then this movie is the ethnic/southern working class analog.

942882,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B000BITUX4,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[8, 11]","Admittedly, I am not the ideal demographic for ""Hustle and Flow"", the new film about a Memphis pimp who dreams of becoming a rap singer. But because of the good reviews I have read, I decided to give the film a try.""Hustle and Flow"" written and directed by Craig Brewer, contains many good things. D Jay (Terrence Howard, ""Crash""), is a low level pimp who doesn't seem to have his heart in it. He basically has two women, one who works the streets, Nola (Taryn Manning), a Caucasian woman with long extensions in her hair who is also getting tired of the life, and Lexus (Paula Jai Parker), who works nights at a strip club. All of these people live together in a small house with Shug (Taraji P. Henson) and Lexus's baby son. One day, D Jay runs into an old classmate, Key (Anthony Anderson) who makes a living recording church singers and  court depositions. They get together and convert a room in D Jay's house into a makeshift recording studio. D Jay learns that Skinny Black (Ludacris), a former Memphis resident who is now a famous rapper, will be returning home to hold an annual Fourth of July party. D Jay decides that he wants to get his demo into Skinny Black's hands, so the famous rapper can help an old friend.`Hustle and Flow"" is filled with clich&eacute;s (gangsta rappers with gold teeth, hookers with a heart of gold, etc.) and I don't know how much emotion anyone can invest in the story of a pimp who wants to become a famous rapper. But the film is very good due in large part to the performance by Terrence Howard. The role of D Jay is the polar opposite of the role he played in ""Crash"", an affluent Television director living in the San Fernando Valley. With these two performances, Howard has demonstrated that he has great ability, perhaps even untapped ability to portray a wide range of characters and become a great actor. He throws himself into the role, fully living the part. His dialect changes, his demeanor, his outlook. Howard conveys the depth and breadth of the characters knowledge and also his crisis with his current life. When he starts to lay down tracks in his make-shift studio, D Jay becomes slightly desperate and Howard conveys this in an emotional, believable way. D Jay is the central character and he is on screen in almost every scene. Howard's performance forces you to pay attention, to watch him.But I have a hard time being empathetic towards a pimp who wants to become a rapper. The film really wants you to feel empathy towards him, to feel for his journey and the troubles in his life. But he's a PIMP! Why should we feel anything for him? Strangely, because of Howard's performance, I did begin to see his character was someone whom I might meet and actually become friends with. But he's a PIMP!The supporting cast is good. Perhaps the strongest member of this group is Shug, played by Taraji P. Henson. Henson's character goes through an entire life's worth of emotions during the course of the film. Normally, I would find this a bit showy and overdramatic, however Henson pulls it off. Early on, we learn that the pregnant Shug takes care of Lexus' son when the stripper is out working and therefore she has an attachment to the child. Later events make this more poignant. Late in the film, Shug does something which causes D Jay to respond in a surprising, natural way. This moment over all others in the film provides the biggest emotional impact in my opinion.Anthony Anderson and DJ Qualls round out the supporting cast and their work is good if unexceptional. For Anderson, it is a very subdued performance and perhaps one of the most natural I have seen him in. Qualls has a good scene with Nola (Manning) which does a great job of making both characters human. They simply talk in the background, sharing a few laughs, finding out how much they have in common.The film's final moments present some twists and turns allowing the film to become more memorable. These twists impact D Jay's life in a way that I didn't expect. They gave his character's life more resonance and interest.""Hustle and Flow"" is a good film with a great performance.",4,A Strong Performance Lifts the Film,1122249600,"07 25, 2005",2005,4113,"['Admittedly', 'am', 'not', 'ideal', 'demographic', 'Hustle', 'Flow', 'new', 'film', 'Memphis', 'pimp', 'who', 'becoming', 'rap', 'singer', 'good', 'reviews', 'have', 'read', 'decided', 'give', 'film', 'try', 'Hustle', 'Flow', 'written', 'directed', 'Craig', 'Brewer', 'many', 'good', 'things', 'D', 'Jay', 'Terrence', 'Howard', 'Crash', 'low', 'level', 'pimp', 'who', ""n't"", 'seem', 'have', 'heart', 'basically', 'two', 'women', 'one', 'who', 'streets', 'Nola', 'Taryn', 'Manning', 'Caucasian', 'woman', 'long', 'extensions', 'hair', 'who', 'also', 'getting', 'tired', 'life', 'Lexus', 'Paula', 'Jai', 'Parker', 'who', 'nights', 'strip', 'club', 'people', 'live', 'together', 'small', 'house', 'Shug', 'Taraji', 'P.', 'Henson', 'Lexus', 'baby', 'son', 'One', 'day', 'D', 'Jay', 'old', 'classmate', 'Key', 'Anthony', 'Anderson', 'who', 'living', 'recording', 'church', 'singers', 'court', 'depositions', 'get', 'together', 'convert', 'room', 'D', 'Jay', 'house', 'makeshift', 'recording', 'studio', 'D', 'Jay', 'Skinny', 'Black', 'Ludacris', 'former', 'Memphis', 'resident', 'who', 'now', 'famous', 'rapper', 'will', 'be', 'returning', 'home', 'hold', 'annual', 'Fourth', 'July', 'party', 'D', 'Jay', 'get', 'demo', 'Skinny', 'Black', 'hands', 'famous', 'rapper', 'can', 'help', 'old', 'friend.', 'Hustle', 'Flow', 'filled', 'clich', 'eacute', 'gangsta', 'rappers', 'gold', 'teeth', 'hookers', 'heart', 'gold', 'etc', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'much', 'emotion', 'anyone', 'can', 'invest', 'story', 'pimp', 'who', 'become', 'famous', 'rapper', 'film', 'very', 'good', 'due', 'large', 'part', 'performance', 'Terrence', 'Howard', 'role', 'D', 'Jay', 'polar', 'opposite', 'role', 'played', 'Crash', 'affluent', 'Television', 'director', 'living', 'San', 'Fernando', 'Valley', 'two', 'performances', 'Howard', 'demonstrated', 'great', 'ability', 'perhaps', 'even', 'untapped', 'ability', 'portray', 'wide', 'range', 'characters', 'become', 'great', 'actor', 'role', 'fully', 'living', 'part', 'dialect', 'changes', 'demeanor', 'outlook', 'Howard', 'conveys', 'depth', 'breadth', 'characters', 'knowledge', 'also', 'crisis', 'current', 'life', 'When', 'lay', 'down', 'tracks', 'make-shift', 'studio', 'D', 'Jay', 'slightly', 'desperate', 'Howard', 'conveys', 'emotional', 'believable', 'way', 'D', 'Jay', 'central', 'character', 'screen', 'almost', 'scene', 'Howard', 'performance', 'forces', 'pay', 'attention', 'watch', 'him.But', 'have', 'hard', 'time', 'being', 'empathetic', 'towards', 'pimp', 'who', 'become', 'rapper', 'film', 'really', 'feel', 'empathy', 'towards', 'feel', 'journey', 'troubles', 'life', 'PIMP', 'Why', 'should', 'feel', 'anything', 'Strangely', 'Howard', 'performance', 'did', 'begin', 'see', 'character', 'was', 'someone', 'whom', 'might', 'meet', 'actually', 'become', 'friends', 'PIMP', 'supporting', 'cast', 'good', 'Perhaps', 'strongest', 'member', 'group', 'Shug', 'played', 'Taraji', 'P.', 'Henson', 'Henson', 'character', 'entire', 'life', 'worth', 'emotions', 'course', 'film', 'Normally', 'would', 'find', 'bit', 'showy', 'overdramatic', 'however', 'Henson', 'off', 'Early', 'learn', 'pregnant', 'Shug', 'care', 'Lexus', 'son', 'when', 'stripper', 'out', 'working', 'therefore', 'attachment', 'child', 'Later', 'events', 'make', 'more', 'poignant', 'Late', 'film', 'Shug', 'something', 'D', 'Jay', 'respond', 'surprising', 'natural', 'way', 'moment', 'others', 'film', 'biggest', 'emotional', 'impact', 'opinion.Anthony', 'Anderson', 'DJ', 'Qualls', 'round', 'out', 'supporting', 'cast', 'work', 'good', 'unexceptional', 'Anderson', 'very', 'subdued', 'performance', 'perhaps', 'one', 'most', 'natural', 'have', 'seen', 'Qualls', 'good', 'scene', 'Nola', 'Manning', 'great', 'job', 'making', 'characters', 'human', 'simply', 'talk', 'background', 'sharing', 'few', 'laughs', 'finding', 'out', 'how', 'much', 'have', 'common.The', 'film', 'final', 'moments', 'present', 'twists', 'allowing', 'film', 'become', 'more', 'memorable', 'twists', 'impact', 'D', 'Jay', 'life', 'way', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'gave', 'character', 'life', 'more', 'resonance', 'interest', 'Hustle', 'Flow', 'good', 'film', 'great', 'performance']",Hustle & Flow

That is if you take its story for its face value.But I can see what the movie was reaching for...like a crossroads blues music, southern music thing. Like a performer selling his soul to the devil to play blues guitar better than Robert Johnson. Like going to Memphis to hear the dirtiest blues on Beale Street.So if you're thinking that its simply a story about a pimp who wants to become a rapper, you're missing over half the story.The movie explores Memphis and it's southern music scene. One that channels the Stax sound--hell, the movie even has Isaac Hayes playing a bar owner--you can hear the Memphis soul in the instrumentals in the soundtrack. It explores melting pot music from folks who have little or no money: the deep gospel vocals, the dirt road blues, the humid, muddy Mississippi, catfish crawling R and Bee. The dutty crunkadelic. Memphis horn sections served with fried chicken and blunt smoke. (Note: The little man who sells the Casio to DJay and the choir in the church are very significant to the story. Also the great Beale Street area is implied, but never shown in the movie.)So while we get the great Terrence Howard as the reforming pimp character (a great performance, by the way) you also see how the MUSIC, real as it can get, is made. A collaborative from the souls who no longer have nothing to lose. Real people music. Raw music. Just like the blues at it's best. But it is represented by the crunking street tunes you hear.
