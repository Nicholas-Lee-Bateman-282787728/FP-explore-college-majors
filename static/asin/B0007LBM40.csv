If you enjoy a good drama you should at least rent this one. An Amish girl, expertly played by Alison Pill, is accused of murdering her baby when they find a dead infant near her parents farm house. She shows signs of giving birth, but she claims she never had the baby. A friend of the family tries to assist them by asking her friend to defend the girl. Mariska Hargatay of ""Law and Order"" plays her attorney deftly. The judge makes her the girls custodian.

I have to say that I tend to avoid the Lifetime channel as a rule, but this particular night I came across the beginning of this movie and it looked interesting. So I gave it a chance. Wow, what a surprise! This turned out to be quite an enjoyable movie with tons more depth and intrigue than a typical Lifetime made-for-television movie will offer. In fact I would even rate it among the top movies I've seen recently.Alison Pill plays a young Amish girl who is arrested on suspicion of killing her newborn child. Normally, the ""girl gets arrested for killing her baby"" wouldn't make for a very worthwhile movie plot since this topic is nothing new, but having an Amish girl be in the center of it all adds an unusual twist to the movie, one of the things it has going for it. And Alison Pill nails this role; I'm shocked that she has not been in more well-known movies. Her acting talent is obvious from the beginning, not to mention being quite attractive. Equally as good is Mariska Hargitay as the lawyer who represents her in court. And she isn't too hard on the eyes either. I don't mean to harp on about the attractiveness of the 2 women in the lead roles, but hey, it certainly doesn't hurt to have that as a bonus.But getting back to the merits of the movie, don't let the word ""Lifetime"" discourage you. Believe me, I've done my fair share of cringing from the painfully-bad movies that Lifetime tends to show. But I can assure you that ""Plain Truth"" is a welcome change, with some great plot twists (you won't see the final one coming a mile away).

882026,AUUH6Z8MSGGF,B0007LBM40,Haunted Flower,"[2, 2]","Plain Truth1 Disc Widescreen, released July 13, 2010""Plain Truth"" was a Lifetime movie from 2004 directed by Paul Shapiro based on the novel by Jodi Picoult. Mariska Hargitay plays Ellie Harrison, a criminal lawyer who takes on the case of a dead baby in an Amish community and the 18-year-old mother, Katie played by Alison Pill who denies she was ever pregnant though medical tests would prove otherwise.Picture the Harrison Ford movie ""Witness"" and switch the male detective to a female defense attorney and a different mystery. That's the feel here. There are lots of comments on the Amish culture's plainness, anti-violent stance, and firm embrace of tradition.Ellie needed a vacation from her profession after feeling guilty about winning her last case when her client probably deserved jail time. As a favor to a friend she takes on this case and in requesting bail, the judge makes the unusual demand that Ellie have to stay in the Amish community till the trial ends to make sure the girl doesn't flee. Mariska Hargitay (from ""Law and Order: SVU) is very convincing in the courtroom and plays the Lifetime level of all-around wonderful leading woman to the fullest.The story takes us down all sorts of paths with what could have happened since Katie keeps lying about the circumstances and giving different versions. The result is frustratingly simple, but at least they didn't go the really obvious route. Alison Pill (whom you might remember from the fantastic ""Dan in Real Life"" movie with Steve Carrell in 2007) was well-cast here since she looks so natural in the plain Amish setting and does well in an understated emotional performance. It was easy to believe her simple logic and thought process, yet she was able to remain a mystery for most of the movie.Since it is a Lifetime movie, our main two leads are women who have to control their own fate with weighty decisions and they threw in a slight romance with a doctor interviewing Katie in a temporary insanity defense tactic. Completely unnecessary, but she called on a man in her time of need even though she's an independent woman who can stand on her own, la la la.This was the best of the three Lifetime movies I reviewed this week because in spite of the cliche, the Amish people are a fascinating people and courtroom dramas appeal to me greatly.Bonus Features: None",3,"One of the better Lifetime movies, but go watch Harrison Ford in ""Witness"" instead",1283817600,"09 7, 2010",2010,2344,"['Plain', 'Truth1', 'Disc', 'Widescreen', 'released', 'July', '13', '2010', 'Plain', 'Truth', 'was', 'Lifetime', 'movie', '2004', 'directed', 'Paul', 'Shapiro', 'based', 'novel', 'Jodi', 'Picoult', 'Mariska', 'Hargitay', 'Ellie', 'Harrison', 'criminal', 'lawyer', 'who', 'case', 'dead', 'baby', 'Amish', 'community', '18-year-old', 'mother', 'Katie', 'played', 'Alison', 'Pill', 'who', 'was', 'ever', 'pregnant', 'medical', 'tests', 'would', 'prove', 'otherwise.Picture', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'movie', 'Witness', 'switch', 'male', 'detective', 'female', 'defense', 'attorney', 'different', 'mystery', 'feel', 'here', 'are', 'lots', 'comments', 'Amish', 'culture', 'plainness', 'anti-violent', 'stance', 'firm', 'embrace', 'tradition.Ellie', 'needed', 'vacation', 'profession', 'feeling', 'guilty', 'winning', 'last', 'case', 'when', 'client', 'probably', 'deserved', 'jail', 'time', 'favor', 'friend', 'case', 'requesting', 'bail', 'judge', 'unusual', 'demand', 'Ellie', 'have', 'stay', 'Amish', 'community', 'till', 'trial', 'make', 'sure', 'girl', ""n't"", 'flee', 'Mariska', 'Hargitay', 'Law', 'Order', 'SVU', 'very', 'convincing', 'courtroom', 'Lifetime', 'level', 'all-around', 'wonderful', 'leading', 'woman', 'fullest.The', 'story', 'down', 'sorts', 'paths', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'happened', 'Katie', 'lying', 'circumstances', 'giving', 'different', 'versions', 'result', 'frustratingly', 'simple', 'least', 'did', ""n't"", 'go', 'really', 'obvious', 'route', 'Alison', 'Pill', 'whom', 'might', 'remember', 'fantastic', 'Dan', 'Real', 'Life', 'movie', 'Steve', 'Carrell', '2007', 'was', 'well-cast', 'here', 'so', 'natural', 'plain', 'Amish', 'setting', 'well', 'understated', 'emotional', 'performance', 'was', 'easy', 'believe', 'simple', 'logic', 'thought', 'process', 'yet', 'was', 'able', 'remain', 'mystery', 'most', 'movie.Since', 'Lifetime', 'movie', 'main', 'two', 'leads', 'are', 'women', 'who', 'have', 'control', 'own', 'fate', 'weighty', 'decisions', 'threw', 'slight', 'romance', 'doctor', 'interviewing', 'Katie', 'temporary', 'insanity', 'defense', 'tactic', 'Completely', 'unnecessary', 'called', 'man', 'time', 'need', 'even', 'independent', 'woman', 'who', 'can', 'stand', 'own', 'la', 'la', 'la.This', 'was', 'best', 'three', 'Lifetime', 'movies', 'reviewed', 'week', 'spite', 'cliche', 'Amish', 'people', 'are', 'fascinating', 'people', 'courtroom', 'dramas', 'appeal', 'greatly.Bonus', 'Features', 'None']",Plain Truth

Expecting huge amounts of melodrama with such a sensational subject matter, I appreciated that the plot remained focused on the investigation, the facts of the case, and the impact on and responsibility of the Amish community.  Of course, any TV production would be lucky to have the presence of Mariska Hargitay.  I could have lived without the simpler lessons doled out to this professional woman (city life and success is always looked on with such disdain in these types of stories), but Hargitay is such a terrific actress that she grounds every role.

Lifetime TV is supposed to be impartial, REALITY-BASED television designed to entertain and educate women and their families.  This movie, while excellently filmed and directed, is a travesty of truth and a blatant case of prejudice, not just against the Amish people but against old-world lifestyles, teachings, and values in general.  I agree that there are definitely some serious mistakes in the old-fashioned ways of living (such as mandatory male dominance and the use of physical discipline), but that is no reason or excuse to say that ALL of the old world is flawed.  Nor should we disregard and condemn rigid moral values, or pretend that such rules would be likely to cause a girl to behave as she does in the movie.  Besides, from what I know, the Amish people do NOT really live or act the way they are portrayed in this movie --- they are not chilly narrow-minded individuals, as the actors in this movie characterize them.  And I speak from experience --- I happen to know some Amish and Mennonite people quite well, and while I wholeheartedly agree that they could certainly stand to ease up a little on a few of their strict rules and on their heavily religion-based lifestyle, they are definitely NOT like the bitter hypocritical people portrayed here.  They are actually very gentle kindly people who care deeply about each other and have strong family values.  They do not banish or disown someone just because, as in the case of this girl's brother, he chooses to depart from some of the ways he was originally taught, especially if the difference in philosophy involves a harmless and relatively minor issue like this (it's not as if the young man decided to live an irresponsible life of debauchery or crime --- all he wanted to do was get a college education).  In fact, as I understand it, the Amish actually have a long-standing policy of always giving each of their offspring a CHOICE of how he desires to live --- once a child reaches a certain age, he is asked whether he wants to continue living under the values and practices of his community, or if he wishes to leave the community and live in a manner of his own personal choosing.  And if he decides to leave, his decision is accepted peaceably and amicably by all.  The young person is permitted to go off and live his (or her) own life without stigma or resentment, either from his family or the community in general.  And he is still loved and cared about by his fellow Amish, and he is completely welcome to come back and visit anytime he pleases.I also took strong exception to the movie's apparent implied assertion that the Amish people are careless or unaware about proper hygiene.  As a matter of fact, the Amish homes and farms I visited appeared remarkably clean and fresh-smelling, and the people were almost all trim and fit and calmly cheerful.  So it is obvious that the Amish lifestyle apparently actually promotes GOOD health, and from what I know, their incidents of infant mortality and irresponsible behavior are actually very low.  Virtually all the Amish children I have seen have been unusually healthy and well-behaved, and the adults live a very long time, too.So in conclusion, I feel that this movie is a despicable portrayal of one of the most harmless and sensible sectors of our population.  As the lawyer in the movie herself stated, Amish people simply do not do things like this (not usually, anyway), so why make a movie claiming that they do?
