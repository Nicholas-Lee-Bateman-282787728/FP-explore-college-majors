It almost seems as if he has repented of his evil ways -- and good for him -- but he hasn't written a hit movie since. A case could be made that his best movies are pure evil, so trashy and manipulative that you can't believe the audacity of the man. Showgirls and Basic Instinct come to mind. So bad they're good? Could be.Sliver and Jade, however, are so bad they are just bad. As for An Alan Smithee Film: Burn Hollywood Burn, it may have been his revenge on Hollywood. At any rate, if you are going to leave Hollywood, it is better to go out in a blaze of glory. Haven't seen An Alan Smithee Film: Burn Hollywood Burn, but I am nevertheless intrigued because Alan Smithee is the name that studios use when the director refuses to even let them use his name -- when a project is THAT bad. Given the Eszterhas track record, who better to bring that story to the silver screen?Joe E. claims he will make a comeback, that he can write a hit movie without having to compromise his religious principles. Maybe he can do something for Mel Gibson?In his heyday, he operated on the principle that Hollywood is driven by greed, and that they would pay a lot of money for a good script, no matter how trashy and hackneyed, and no matter what a jerk the writer was; IF they thought it would make them a lot of MONEY. Here is a man who demanded AND received millions of dollars for ideas he scribbled on napkins over lunch. Sometimes the gamble paid off, and sometimes it went down in flames.Jagged Edge is actually a pretty good film, with great performances by Glenn Close, Jeff Bridges, Peter Coyote, and Robert Loggia, as Sam Ransom, the hard boiled private dick with a potty mouth that just won't quit.Glenn Close plays former Assistant District Attroney Teddy Barnes. She has worked with Krasny (Peter Coyote), the D.A. before. She used to work for the prosecution, but now she plays defense. She knows that Krasny doesn't play fair, and she feels guilty that they have convicted innocents in their zeal for Mean Justice.Glenn comes close to perhaps her best performance (the one she did in Fatal Attraction), and Jeff bridges the gap between a cold blooded killer, and a charming guy falsely accused of a crime he didn't commit. You are never sure which it is, and I wouldn't spoil it for ya.Peter Coyote as the D.A., an over zealous prosecutor who will stop at nothing to get a conviction, really rang true for me. The ends justify the means, but then you end up with Mean Justice* (*good title for a book, hint, hint, hint).What you have in Jagged Ed ge is a competent thriller with a very professional cast. They all put in very polished performances -- which is why the movie is such a big disappointment.

16518,A20NJAPECFGIR9,0767821742,,"[4, 6]","I won't say Jagged Edge isn't good or entertaining because it is a very good film. The problem starts with loopholes within a terribly predictable plot. By the middle of the film, even the smart defense tactics of Teddy Barnes ( Glenn Close ) can't help the film's demise.  There was no question that Jack Forrester ( Jeff Bridges ) committed the murders. The problem is the director can't keep this a secret for very long.There is no difference between this and a million other courtroom dramas. You have the smart, fiesty female lawyer who swears to everyone she won't fall for the charms of the handsome rich defendent but, of course she falls for his charms and into his bed. From that point Teddy Barnes lost all credibility of claiming she's a smart lawyer. The plot doesn't stay true to the characters. Teddy's a smart woman yet she plays the dumb victim at every turn. She misses signs anyone in their first year of law school should spot. Jack is painted as suave and brilliant yet he leaves the typewriter ( the item that brings it all together ) in his closet for Teddy to find. Jagged Edge has a lot of supposedly smart folks doing dumb things and it makes no sense.  The film started out as an intelligent thriller but switched to a cheap serial killer flick with a tacky and very stupid ending.On the flipside, this is a very good movie IF you watch it for entertainment only. If you watch it for knowledge or to see a good thriller you are wasting your time. The plot can be figured out by a five year-old in ten minutes and this film is NOTHING unique. Close's and Bridges' chemistry keeps you interested no matter how shabby the film ends up. But the true  winners are Robert Loggia and Peter Coyote who steal the show easily with their vibrant, exciting performances. Loggia brought some comedy relief to the drabby scenes and Coyote sparked things up when Close got boring. Jeff Bridges appeared quite dry and I didn't buy him as someone with the brains of masterminding a so-called great plan.  Glenn Close played Teddy the way she should have been played. The problem is the character was written with too much heart and not enough brain.  That's not too good for a lead character that everyone keeps claiming is such a great lawyer.

16519,A356TJCTCLDN89,0767821742,,"[4, 8]","Jagged Edge hasn't aged that well. The courtroom scenes look silly now. Jeff Bridges' character is on trial for the murder of his wife and her maid. We never hear the maid's name, we never see even a brief shot of her relatives. If found not guilty of his wife's murder apparently the court will toss out the maid's case as a freebie. Later Glen Close's character looks up and sees a tired and  sad looking black woman sitting in the back of the court and she's dressed like it's 1962. I thought that was particularly lame. The minority characters are just symbols in this movie.Ignoring the court room scenes for a moment I have to say that Peter Coyote gives a stand out performance. I also liked the old cop played by Robert Loggia.  Glen Close is playing a smart woman who does two really dumb things: You don't get romantic with your client and you don't let your emotions concerning a past case ruin your understanding of the case you're working on now.Nevertheless, Glen falls hard for her client and the scene where she looks in the linen closet and realizes that  hot dangit, she's got a  sadistic rapist and murderer for a lover is the best in the movie. The final scene is quite good as well. When the glass in Glen's front door is smashed it's gasp and jump in your seat time.  Jagged Edge is an okay but not especially memorable movie.

And also, I believe that dissecting the murder scene is part of the court case. Yet that didn't happen. Anyway, I like Jagged Edge for entirely different reasons because it's a quite thrilling who-dun-it mystery. The ending is credulous, but Teddy Barnes' blindness to the truth is rather incredulous. I am pretty sure everybody but her saw this coming. I admit that, I was really back and forth on my guesses. My favorite performance of the film is Robert Loggia's (who was deservedly nominated for the Oscar). His final line of the film is the greatest, and he is still the man. Score one for Joe Eszterhas too for his writing. As always, his work has invariably produced pictures to be interesting and compelling to watch no matter how implausible they can be, and Jagged Edge is no exception to this.

The plot centers on a wealthy (and handsome) San Francisco publisher (Jeff Bridges) who is accused of murdering his wife. He is defended by a beautiful, divorced and principled lawyer (Glenn Close). In her earlier career, Close's character had been a public prosecutor and has bad blood with the DA prosecuting her current client.Bridges and Close become involved-which is of course highly unethical-during the pretrial research phase. Most of the movie then  takes place in court as the mighty Close battles for her client despite a number of twists and turns. The ending and the ultimate twist to that ending come as no huge surprise. However, it is fun watching them get to that point. Plus, you get lots of beautiful San Francisco and Bay ARea scenery.I would recommend this movie to those who enjoy courtroom dramas, Glenn Close and Jeff Bridges films of the 80's (the film is not overly dated but clearly of that era), and mysteries.

Then again, what can you expect from Joe Eszterhas, the writer of ""Flashdance,"" ""Basic Instinct,"" and most dubiously ""Showgirls."" The story is about Jack Forrester (Bridges), a good looking and charming man accused of killing his wife, heiress Paige Forrester. Attorney Teddy Barnes (Close) comes out of retirement from criminal cases to defend him; the prosecutor for the case is Thomas Krasny (Peter Coyote), who is the reason Teddy left criminal law for corporate law. Plenty of bad blood between the two. Naturally (?!?), legal eagle Teddy falls for Jack and crosses the professional line, even though her sidekick, the phlegmy foul mouthed Sam Ransom (Robert Loggia) believes Jack is really guilty. I really found very little suspense and few shocking plot twists...in fact much of the plot is extremely contrived. The ending is almost laughable; without giving away the plot, let's just say it is hard to believe that one of the main characters could be so brilliant and so stupid at the same time. Close's monologue in court at the end is also hard to sit through; it is so out of character for this sharp attorney to drone on unprofessionally about a colleague to the media. Too many ""bows"" are tied together at the end for this movie to really be plausible. The saddest part is that with some good editing and a better writer, this film could have been fantastic, considering the talented cast.The picture is decent with good color, but definitely not a super-sharp transfer.

Performances by Jeff Bridges as the man on trial and Glen Close as the lawyer defending(who falls in love with him) are very good.Well worth a look,5,Jagged Edge,1295222400,"01 17, 2011",2011,403,"['One', 'time', 'favourite', 'films', 'great', 'courtroom', 'thriller', 'masked', 'killer', 'entering', 'home', 'lady', 'kill', 'her.It', 'great', 'twist', 'end', 'do', ""n't"", 'find', 'out', 'who', 'killer', 'end', 'film', 'Performances', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'man', 'trial', 'Glen', 'Close', 'lawyer', 'defending', 'who', 'love', 'are', 'very', 'good.Well', 'look']",N/A

Most of the violence is suggested, and the main of the movie is a tight legal drama. Glenn Close plays a divorced attorney who gave up criminal cases but ends up defending a wealthy client (played by Jeff Bridges) who is accused of murdering his wife.  The characters are not always believable, but that's part of the fun.  Watching this movie had me changing my mind every ten minutes as to whether he did it or not, not really finding out the answer until the final minutes of the film.  This movie really built suspense.  Some might call it unbelievable, but what does that matter when the movie is so entertaining and keeping you guessing until the very end.",5,Great flick for fans of Basic Instinct,1020124800,"04 30, 2002",2002,764,"['movie', 'pure', 'Eszterhas', 'combination', 'salacious', 'sex', 'violence', 'being', 'overly', 'gory', 'Most', 'violence', 'suggested', 'main', 'movie', 'tight', 'legal', 'drama', 'Glenn', 'Close', 'divorced', 'attorney', 'who', 'gave', 'up', 'criminal', 'cases', 'up', 'defending', 'wealthy', 'client', 'played', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'who', 'accused', 'murdering', 'wife', 'characters', 'are', 'not', 'always', 'believable', 'part', 'fun', 'Watching', 'movie', 'had', 'changing', 'mind', 'ten', 'minutes', 'did', 'not', 'not', 'really', 'finding', 'out', 'answer', 'final', 'minutes', 'film', 'movie', 'really', 'built', 'suspense', 'might', 'call', 'unbelievable', 'what', 'matter', 'when', 'movie', 'so', 'entertaining', 'keeping', 'guessing', 'very', 'end']",N/A
16531,A2C7WAXG5OHTZ7,0767821742,Matthew Rocca,"[27, 30]","&quot;JAGGED EDGE&quot; begins on a stormy night at a beach home. A killer walks through the halls with a jagged hunting knife in his hands. After he has killed a rich woman and her maid, and written the &quot;B&quot; word on the wall with her blood, Jack Forrester, the victim's husband, is arrested. Glenn Close plays his lawyer who falls in love with him. The two have a forbidden affair. Did he do it? Or didn't he? There's plenty of evidence on both sides. Is Glenn Close's character defending him because she honestly believes in her mind he is innocent, or is &quot;another part of her anatomy&quot; doing the thinking? Suspense and mystery are so well done in this film, and it is never boring. What an exquisite movie, with marvelous performances from Glenn Close and Jeff Bridges. The beginning is very eerie and frightening, but it would have been even more frightening had it not been on a &quot;mysterious stormy night&quot; like most thrillers, and it was just a nice, serene night, and suddenly he comes in and kills her. Still, it was very well done. The ending could have included more detail, but really, I loved the movie so much, I don't care. WHAT A MYSTERY! WHAT TWISTS! WHAT A THRILLING RIDE! FOR FANS OF MYSTERY AND COURTROOM DRAMA I DEFINELY RECOMMEND THIS SPECTACULAR FILM!!! P.S. The music perfectly fit the moods of the movie too.",5,Did he do it or didn't he?

Played by Jeff Bridges, the publisher is, shall we say, duplicitous and perhaps not entirely to be trusted - or believed.

The cast is absolutely superb, with Bridges as a mysterious and charming defendant who seduces his lawyer, Close.  The lawyer has many issues she is struggling with:  a divorcee single mother, career choices that haunt her with guilt, and a case that saps her flagging energy.  Thus, it is supposed to be a thriller with realistic people, and it succeeds at it.  Unfortunately, it leaves an unsatisfying feeling at the end, which is a deus ex machina non-surprise.
