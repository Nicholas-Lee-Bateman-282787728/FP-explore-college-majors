The movie is set during a day and age where there was no help for the abused. My mom had bought this movie off of Amazon and shown it to me. Its worth every star and more. You start to feel deeply for the children and their mother who suffer great abuse at the hands of their father/husband. This movie is full of vivid horrendous scenes that feel very real. You start to feel immense hatred towards the husband, his parents, and her mother. How can they sit back and do nothing when their son is beating on his wife infront of his children?! How can her own mother tell her to go back to her husband, that no matter what, her place is by his side?! The Burning Bed made me feel a lot of things, including happiness when the husband died, I felt he deserved it for all the pain he inflicted on others.

380465,AP0DQSDFSLP4P,6303581307,"Christopher M. MacNeil ""Chris M""","[58, 59]","The prelude to this 1984 NBC-TV movie was a massive media blitz about Farrah Fawcett's chances of proving her acting worthiness. It was, and still is to some extent, unfortunate because it detracted from the purpose of the film: to bring the then-generally hushed family secret of domestic violence into the light and elevate it as a matter of public policy. Fawcett, of course, proved beyond anyone's doubt her acting prowess, and watching her as a deglamorized, demoralized and traumatized physically battered wife was a shock of extremities at the time. Before ""Burning Bed,"" who saw Fawcett as anything other than a giggly sex kitten? The film opens with a clearly beaten Fawcett nearly roboticized in the mechanics of carrying a container of gas into the bedroom where her drunken husband has passed out after what we learn later is his latest (and last) in countless wife-beating episodes that lasted for nearly a decade. It is no consolation watching Fawcett's character of Francine douse her husband and then ignite him and his bed with a match. What follows is the obligatory murder trial where, in mostly flashbacks by way of interviews with her court-appointed attorney (unflappably played by Richard Masur) and trial testimony, Francine and corraborating witnesses recount the years of spousal violence. Through it all, at a time when domestic violence shamefully was pretty much still in the closet as one of those family embarrassments that no one discussed, director Robert Greenwald hits us with a painful and disarming portrait of the results of family violence. But Fawcett is shattering! She manages to project her character not only as someone to be pitied and as someone truly desperate but who, somewhere in all the demoralizing inflicted over 10 years, finds some courage within to end her vicitimization, even at the risk of a death sentence. And Fawcett's acting when her character takes the stand in her own defense is nothing less than riveting! Fawcett's truly beaten-down character makes it very easy to hope the worst for her victimizer (Paul Le Mat as the bullying wife-beater) and his nauseating supportive mother (character actress Grace Zabriskie in a magnificent portrayal). In the wake of ""Burning Bed,"" Fawcett herself appeared in public service announcements empowering battered women not to endure anymore, and the subject of domestic violence gained a status in the national diaglogue that it hadn't before. The film's message is still relevent and important today, unfortunately. But now, unlike the days when the real Francine faced her legal judgement, victims have more choices than the only one open to Francine. If for no other reason, though, Fawcett's performance is a must-see, and she'll numb you. It remains perhaps her greatest acting achievement!",4,"Still relevant, the human faces of domestic violence",1046044800,"02 24, 2003",2003,2799,"['prelude', '1984', 'NBC-TV', 'movie', 'was', 'massive', 'media', 'blitz', 'Farrah', 'Fawcett', 'chances', 'proving', 'acting', 'worthiness', 'was', 'still', 'extent', 'unfortunate', 'detracted', 'purpose', 'film', 'bring', 'then-generally', 'hushed', 'family', 'secret', 'domestic', 'violence', 'light', 'elevate', 'matter', 'public', 'policy', 'Fawcett', 'course', 'proved', 'anyone', 'doubt', 'acting', 'prowess', 'watching', 'deglamorized', 'demoralized', 'traumatized', 'physically', 'battered', 'wife', 'was', 'shock', 'extremities', 'time', 'Burning', 'Bed', 'who', 'saw', 'Fawcett', 'anything', 'other', 'giggly', 'sex', 'kitten', 'film', 'clearly', 'beaten', 'Fawcett', 'nearly', 'roboticized', 'mechanics', 'carrying', 'container', 'gas', 'bedroom', 'where', 'drunken', 'husband', 'passed', 'out', 'what', 'learn', 'later', 'latest', 'last', 'countless', 'wife-beating', 'episodes', 'lasted', 'nearly', 'decade', 'consolation', 'watching', 'Fawcett', 'character', 'Francine', 'husband', 'then', 'ignite', 'bed', 'match', 'What', 'obligatory', 'murder', 'trial', 'where', 'mostly', 'flashbacks', 'way', 'interviews', 'court-appointed', 'attorney', 'unflappably', 'played', 'Richard', 'Masur', 'trial', 'testimony', 'Francine', 'corraborating', 'witnesses', 'recount', 'years', 'spousal', 'violence', 'time', 'when', 'domestic', 'violence', 'shamefully', 'was', 'pretty', 'much', 'still', 'closet', 'one', 'family', 'embarrassments', 'one', 'discussed', 'director', 'Robert', 'Greenwald', 'painful', 'disarming', 'portrait', 'results', 'family', 'violence', 'Fawcett', 'shattering', 'project', 'character', 'not', 'only', 'someone', 'be', 'pitied', 'someone', 'truly', 'desperate', 'who', 'somewhere', 'demoralizing', 'inflicted', '10', 'years', 'courage', 'end', 'vicitimization', 'even', 'risk', 'death', 'sentence', 'Fawcett', 'acting', 'when', 'character', 'stand', 'own', 'defense', 'nothing', 'less', 'riveting', 'Fawcett', 'truly', 'beaten-down', 'character', 'very', 'easy', 'hope', 'worst', 'victimizer', 'Paul', 'Le', 'Mat', 'bullying', 'wife-beater', 'nauseating', 'supportive', 'mother', 'character', 'actress', 'Grace', 'Zabriskie', 'magnificent', 'portrayal', 'wake', 'Burning', 'Bed', 'Fawcett', 'appeared', 'public', 'service', 'announcements', 'empowering', 'battered', 'women', 'not', 'endure', 'anymore', 'subject', 'domestic', 'violence', 'gained', 'status', 'national', 'diaglogue', 'had', ""n't"", 'before', 'film', 'message', 'still', 'relevent', 'important', 'today', 'unfortunately', 'now', 'days', 'when', 'real', 'Francine', 'faced', 'legal', 'judgement', 'victims', 'have', 'more', 'choices', 'only', 'one', 'open', 'Francine', 'other', 'reason', 'though', 'Fawcett', 'performance', 'must-see', ""'ll"", 'numb', 'perhaps', 'greatest', 'acting', 'achievement']",Burning Bed VHS

It's still one of the most disturbing tv movies, and I still find it more disturbing than ""Amelia"" the movie with Ted Danson who plays a father who molests his daughter Amellia. I saw the actual beatings that Francine would experience in this movie where the actual seducing of Amellia was non-existent. I feel bad for Francine through this movie as she's feeling trapped at times, but there are also moments where she shows that people enjoy stomping on a heart that's good. I had watched another movie called ""Intimate Strangers"" with Dennis Weaver and Sally Struthers only 2 months earlier. There's a difference in the 2 movies. in Intimate Weaver's character admits he was physically abused by his father here there may have been some abuse that happened to Francine's husband, but it's not really disclosed. He does have a drinking problem, but there's one element that's explained here, and that's there's no excuse needed for a person to start abusing another person only the will and desire to do so. Francine's husband had the will and desire to do harm to her; it was well-veilled in the beginning, but then it only took for the husband's family to barge in on them shortly after returning from the honeymoon. It appears that the husband resented having his family show up unannounced, and probably uninvited, and he dind't handle it too well which leads me to believe that he would've abused Francine regardless that day. Who knows? However, once it started it grew more and more disturbing with every time it happened, but the last time was the worst because it showed that he was probably getting off from hitting her, and this was after she complied with burning her school books, but this was to foreware her if she ever did it again. I applaud what she did as she felt there was no other recourse. I say this because I did exhibit abuse behavior towards my wife. Not necessarily striking her physically, but slamming doors, pounding my fist, the terrifying glare, and alot of put-downs and painful words. I do need help with this as it makes me an abuser. I know alot of my family would think that I'm too drastic with my reasoning, but let's face it I needed to keep the upper hand on things to keep me from slamming myself down, or feel like others were. I need help with this before getting involved with another woman.

Callahan (""Charles in Charge"") plays Farrah's father-in-law, and Grace Zabriskie plays mother-in-law Flossie, a backwards-thinking Southern woman who lies on the witness stand to protect her son. She gives a chilling portrayal and was only six years older than Farrah in real life!The final beating showcases Fawcett's acting chops as she conveys sheer terror with only her eyes, and the climactic courtroom scene is also a standout when she tries to hold it all together.The best TV role of Farrah's career came at the end of the '80s in ""Small Sacrifices"", but this one is a great runner-up!The DVD itself is a bare-bones release, but TV movies are rarely released in the format, so it's no big deal.",4,"Farrah's Breakthrough as a ""Serious"" Actress",1286150400,"10 4, 2010",2010,1712,"['who', 'only', 'remember', 'Farrah', 'Fawcett', 'Charlie', 'Angels', 'only', 'need', 'watch', 'Burning', 'Bed', 'discover', 'Farrah', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'just', 'dazzling', 'smile', 'tousled', 'blonde', 'mane.This', 'TV-movie', 'one', 'really', 'put', 'Farrah', 'map', 'serious', 'dramatic', 'actress', 'when', 'originally', 'aired', 'great', 'acclaim', 'back', '1984.The', 'sad', 'thing', 'subject', 'matter', 'still', 'relevant', 'today', 'film', 'way', 'dated.It', 'years', '1963-77', 'Fawcett', 'Francine', 'Hughes', 'who', 'eventually', 'slightly', 'older', 'Mickey', 'Hughes', 'played', 'Paul', 'Le', 'Mat.Though', 'Mickey', 'early', 'signs', 'abuse', 'Francine', 'apologetic', 'nature', 'following', 'incident', 'fact', 'trouble', 'finding', 'work', 'stressed', 'having', 'couple', 'living', 'parents.Speaking', 'parents', 'found', 'be', 'much', 'scarier', 'Mickey', 'way', 'turned', 'blind', 'eye', 'refused', 'help', 'sided', 'son', 'violent', 'nature.James', 'T.', 'Callahan', 'Charles', 'Charge', 'Farrah', 'father-in-law', 'Grace', 'Zabriskie', 'mother-in-law', 'Flossie', 'backwards-thinking', 'Southern', 'woman', 'who', 'witness', 'stand', 'protect', 'son', 'chilling', 'portrayal', 'was', 'only', 'six', 'years', 'older', 'Farrah', 'real', 'life', 'final', 'beating', 'Fawcett', 'acting', 'chops', 'sheer', 'terror', 'only', 'eyes', 'climactic', 'courtroom', 'scene', 'also', 'standout', 'when', 'hold', 'together.The', 'best', 'TV', 'role', 'Farrah', 'career', 'came', 'end', ""'80s"", 'Small', 'Sacrifices', 'one', 'great', 'runner-up', 'DVD', 'bare-bones', 'release', 'TV', 'movies', 'are', 'rarely', 'released', 'format', 'big', 'deal']",Burning Bed VHS

On top of this, social services seems all too willing to look the other way.Francine tries to make the best of her situation, she finds herself drawn back to him, and even after she manages to obtain a divorce, Mickey is still able to insinuate himself into her life, insisting that they need to be a family. No matter how many times she leaves him, or attempts to escape, he is always right on her heels, and uses their children as leverage in order to coerce her into reconciling with him. Even when law enforcement intervenes, it does not deter him. Mickey blames his behavior on his drinking, inability to hold down a job, and on Francine, and, like many abusive spouses, does everything and anything he can to rob her of her independence and sense of self-worth. He feels threatened when she even looks at other men, wears revealing clothing, and attempts to further her education. When he is severely injured in an auto accident, he is not above manipulating the situation to his advantage. Finally, Francine snaps. She douses the bedroom with gasoline as he lies in a drunken sleep, and lights a match, fleeing in her automobile with her offspring.It then must be determined if she committed premeditated murder, or if she was temporarily unhinged.The jury's verdict is in favor of the defense, and as people file out of the courtroom, Francine cuddles her children around her . . . . . .People who have not experienced domestic violence themselves or studied this crime may not be sympathetic or understanding toward what these victims experience. There is indeed a string of victims, not just the abused partner in question but also the children. Ignorant individuals sometimes blame or second-guess the victims, typical questions, ""Why didn't she leave earlier?"", ""Why didn't she call the cops?"", or, ""Why does she keep going back to him?"" This film should be aired frequently, and has recently been released on DVD. Kudos to the cast for their realistic and heartbreaking portrayals in this true life story.

I remember vividly when this movie made its debut on NBC in the fall of 1984. The network spent thousands promoting the film both in print and on the airwaves as the film became a must see event. ""The Burning Bed"" was based on a nonfiction novel written by Faith McNulty about a Michigan housewife and mother who is battered both physically and mentally by her husband for years. Finally one night after having too many beatings she sends her children to the car and sets her husband ablaze while he is sleeping. She eventually goes to the police and confesses what she did. The film is heartbreaking, well-acted, emotional, and most of all extremely graphic in its depiction of family violence. Farrah Fawcett actually suffered bruises from filming the physical abuse scenes. Paul LeMat plays the husband superbly and as a viewer you want his character to pay for the harm he has inflicted upon his wife. ""The Burning Bed"" went on to enjoy the highest ratings for any TV movie of the 1980's and is widely used in college classrooms as a tool in educating students on domestic abuse. Farrah Fawcett also recieved an Emmy Award nomination for Best Actress in a movie made for TV, but unfortunately lost.",5,"""Outstanding Film""",1262736000,"01 6, 2010",2010,1379,"['One', 'greatest', 'TV', 'movies', 'ever', 'made', 'Farrah', 'Fawcett', 'proved', 'was', 'excellent', 'actress', 'could', 'do', 'more', 'just', 'be', 'pretty', 'face', 'days', 'Charlie', 'Anegels', 'remember', 'vividly', 'when', 'movie', 'made', 'debut', 'NBC', 'fall', '1984', 'network', 'spent', 'thousands', 'promoting', 'film', 'print', 'airwaves', 'film', 'became', 'must', 'see', 'event', 'Burning', 'Bed', 'was', 'based', 'nonfiction', 'novel', 'written', 'Faith', 'McNulty', 'Michigan', 'housewife', 'mother', 'who', 'battered', 'physically', 'mentally', 'husband', 'years', 'Finally', 'one', 'night', 'having', 'too', 'many', 'beatings', 'children', 'car', 'husband', 'ablaze', 'sleeping', 'eventually', 'police', 'what', 'did', 'film', 'heartbreaking', 'well-acted', 'emotional', 'most', 'extremely', 'graphic', 'depiction', 'family', 'violence', 'Farrah', 'Fawcett', 'actually', 'suffered', 'bruises', 'filming', 'physical', 'abuse', 'scenes', 'Paul', 'LeMat', 'husband', 'superbly', 'viewer', 'want', 'character', 'pay', 'harm', 'inflicted', 'wife', 'Burning', 'Bed', 'went', 'enjoy', 'highest', 'ratings', 'TV', 'movie', '1980', 'widely', 'used', 'college', 'classrooms', 'tool', 'educating', 'students', 'domestic', 'abuse', 'Farrah', 'Fawcett', 'also', 'recieved', 'Emmy', 'Award', 'nomination', 'Best', 'Actress', 'movie', 'made', 'TV', 'unfortunately', 'lost']",Burning Bed VHS
