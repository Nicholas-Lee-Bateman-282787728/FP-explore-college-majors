892295,AVT9Q9PTUCDMR,B0007WFUN8,Brian Maitland,"[0, 0]","Basically, all this DVD is is the History Channel's ""Modern Marvels"" episode of Baseball Parks. That's it. No extras at all.You'd think with a juicy topic as this you'd get inside tours of ballparks, maybe some interviews with architects (hey, how about a whole featurette on HOK Sports which designed most of the retro ballparks of today?) even some photo galleries of ballparks.The show takes you up to the point where the San Francisco's Pac Bell (AT&T; or whatever they call it now) Park is in the building stages so it's not really all that up to date.A very poor release that adds zero to the original TV show broadcast.",1,superficial in DVD form,1322524800,"11 29, 2011",2011,626,"['Basically', 'DVD', 'History', 'Channel', 'Modern', 'Marvels', 'episode', 'Baseball', 'Parks', 'extras', 'all.You', ""'d"", 'think', 'juicy', 'topic', ""'d"", 'get', 'inside', 'tours', 'ballparks', 'maybe', 'interviews', 'architects', 'hey', 'how', 'whole', 'featurette', 'HOK', 'Sports', 'designed', 'most', 'retro', 'ballparks', 'today', 'even', 'photo', 'galleries', 'ballparks.The', 'show', 'point', 'where', 'San', 'Francisco', 'Pac', 'Bell', 'AT', 'T', 'call', 'now', 'Park', 'building', 'stages', 'not', 'really', 'up', 'date.A', 'very', 'poor', 'release', 'zero', 'original', 'TV', 'show', 'broadcast']",Modern Marvels: Baseball Parks - History Channel

It is, however, not what contents in this film. The main theme is the evolution of the ball parks from 19th century to the present. Of course, it is good to know why a ball park shapes like that, why is it situated at the outskirt of the city, and why it moves back to the heart of the city. Through the film, I just feel it misses something, perhaps many. For example, memorable moments, HOFers or teams with that park are worthy of mentioning.Like many DVD's of the THC, I always feel the running time is too short and I just grab the surface. This film is no exception. Every time when I begin to feel interested in what they mention, it just finishes and jumps to another. I'd like to see this topic addressed again in another DVD.",3,"Not bad, just not so satisfying",1169596800,"01 24, 2007",2007,855,"['series', 'Modern', 'Marvels', 'expect', 'beginning', 'see', 'technology', 'building', 'ball', 'parks', 'however', 'not', 'what', 'film', 'main', 'theme', 'evolution', 'ball', 'parks', '19th', 'century', 'present', 'course', 'good', 'know', 'why', 'ball', 'park', 'shapes', 'why', 'situated', 'outskirt', 'city', 'why', 'back', 'heart', 'city', 'film', 'just', 'feel', 'something', 'perhaps', 'many', 'example', 'memorable', 'moments', 'HOFers', 'teams', 'park', 'are', 'worthy', 'mentioning.Like', 'many', 'DVD', 'THC', 'always', 'feel', 'running', 'time', 'too', 'short', 'just', 'grab', 'surface', 'film', 'exception', 'time', 'when', 'begin', 'feel', 'interested', 'what', 'mention', 'just', 'finishes', 'jumps', ""'d"", 'like', 'see', 'topic', 'addressed', 'again', 'DVD']",Modern Marvels: Baseball Parks - History Channel

Although it is well-organized, it needs more depth. Ken Burns' ""Baseball: The Tenth Inning"", has a fascinating section with a Fenway Park tour guide. ""Ballparks"" could have benefited from that kind of approach, as well as more memorable photos, as in the ""Take Me Out To The Ballpark"" wall calendar. I also wanted to know more about HOK Sports and memorable moments in the various parks. It needed more.
