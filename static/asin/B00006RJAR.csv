Buford's doctor says he should consider resigning because of his injuries. But Buford won't rest until he catches those who shot him up and killed his wife Pauline. His enemies get together to conspire. Pinky Dobson is told to finish the job this time or he'll be put out of the whiskey business. They will make it look like an accident this time. Buford will run again, he is a hero to the people. Stock car racing is a popular spectator sport. Can it be fixed by creating an accident? A dollar of corn and sugar creates a $6 bottle of moonshine, a better return than growing crops. A call about ""drunk and disorderly"" brings the Sheriff. Can he handle it alone? [Is this a set up?]""Steamer"" resists arrest, there is a gunshot. Buford calls for help and they quickly arrive. Back home he sees strangers. Who are they? Buford recognizes a man in a photo, he is from Boston. He orders a new and unmarked car. They get a search warrant for another distillery to raid. They are dressed in camouflage. One man does something stupid. This still is destroyed, and their vehicles. Witter plans a car accident for Buford. Could someone tamper with his car's wheel nuts? Buford sees a car following him, then speeding past him. A whiskey runner? Can rough dirt roads cause an accident? Another set up? Witter has a plan to trap Buford. Buford wants that blue car stopped. He learns that driver is in town buying Black Angus cattle. The search warrant allows a search of this car. There is collateral damage during the search. They find a bottle of rye whiskey for evidence. ""You're my kind of Sheriff"" says a Deputy. A friendly woman doing research meets Buford.Moonshiners are caught. Who is paying them? One prisoner tells of another place, it is raided. Will the men talk? Buford needs to get to the man at the top. Two hunters see another still and report it. Can that woman get information? Buford gets a telephone call. But first he checks his engine and sees a problem [No dogs to warn about strangers?] A tripwire warns of the approaching Deputies. Later a truck with wooden planks is stopped and searched ""Who's your boss?"" A deal is made for information. A Deputy borrows Buford's car. On the road it goes out of control and crashes! It was sabotaged. Can the neighboring Sheriff chase Pardee into McNairy county?Buford ran a background check on that Graduate Student. Can she lead him on? Buford isn't fooled and sends her away. Witter gives his associates one last chance, or else. The neighboring county Sheriff calls Buford so he can setup a roadblock to stop that car, but it goes off the road. Can they set up a roadblock on a river? The Sheriff raids another still. Boss Dodson drives his speedboat along the river until he hits a log. Margaret visits Dobson in the hospital. Can he escape? A Federal official is investigating Dobson now. There are shots and another car chase. [This pads out the film.] Margaret talks. Buford sends word to cover that boarding house. Ray Henry is trapped. But he gets off a shot before going down. Buford rides in an ambulance again. Later we see what happend. Did they make it look like an accident?This is based on a true story, but changed for dramatic effect. Many rural people only work par-time (seasonal) and look for other jobs to scrape by. Some can be tempted to work at an illegal activity. This story educates you about organized crime outside the big cities. Ever wonder why they don't make movies about organized crime in the big cities like they did in the 1930s?",4,The Rest of the Story,1381968000,"10 17, 2013",2013,3655,"['Walking', 'Tall', 'Part', 'II', '1975', 'filmIn', 'McNairy', 'county', 'citizens', 'are', 'destroying', 'gambling', 'equipment', 'furnishings', 'Lucky', 'Spot', 'Buford', 'doctor', 'should', 'consider', 'resigning', 'injuries', 'Buford', 'wo', ""n't"", 'rest', 'who', 'shot', 'up', 'killed', 'wife', 'Pauline', 'enemies', 'get', 'together', 'conspire', 'Pinky', 'Dobson', 'told', 'finish', 'job', 'time', ""'ll"", 'be', 'put', 'whiskey', 'business', 'will', 'make', 'look', 'accident', 'time', 'Buford', 'will', 'run', 'again', 'hero', 'people', 'Stock', 'car', 'racing', 'popular', 'spectator', 'sport', 'Can', 'be', 'fixed', 'creating', 'accident', 'dollar', 'corn', 'sugar', '6', 'bottle', 'moonshine', 'better', 'return', 'growing', 'crops', 'call', 'drunk', 'disorderly', 'Sheriff', 'Can', 'handle', 'alone', '[', 'set', 'up', ']', 'Steamer', 'arrest', 'gunshot', 'Buford', 'help', 'quickly', 'arrive', 'Back', 'home', 'strangers', 'Who', 'are', 'Buford', 'man', 'photo', 'Boston', 'orders', 'new', 'unmarked', 'car', 'get', 'search', 'warrant', 'distillery', 'raid', 'are', 'dressed', 'camouflage', 'One', 'man', 'something', 'stupid', 'still', 'destroyed', 'vehicles', 'Witter', 'car', 'accident', 'Buford', 'Could', 'someone', 'tamper', 'car', 'wheel', 'nuts', 'Buford', 'car', 'following', 'then', 'speeding', 'whiskey', 'runner', 'Can', 'rough', 'dirt', 'roads', 'cause', 'accident', 'set', 'up', 'Witter', 'plan', 'trap', 'Buford', 'Buford', 'blue', 'car', 'stopped', 'driver', 'town', 'buying', 'Black', 'Angus', 'cattle', 'search', 'warrant', 'search', 'car', 'collateral', 'damage', 'search', 'find', 'bottle', 'rye', 'whiskey', 'evidence', ""'re"", 'kind', 'Sheriff', 'Deputy', 'A', 'friendly', 'woman', 'doing', 'research', 'meets', 'Buford.Moonshiners', 'are', 'caught', 'Who', 'paying', 'One', 'prisoner', 'tells', 'place', 'raided', 'Will', 'men', 'talk', 'Buford', 'get', 'man', 'top', 'Two', 'hunters', 'see', 'still', 'report', 'Can', 'woman', 'get', 'information', 'Buford', 'telephone', 'call', 'first', 'engine', 'problem', 'dogs', 'warn', 'strangers', ']', 'A', 'tripwire', 'warns', 'approaching', 'Deputies', 'Later', 'truck', 'wooden', 'planks', 'stopped', 'searched', 'Who', 'boss', 'deal', 'made', 'information', 'Deputy', 'Buford', 'car', 'road', 'control', 'crashes', 'was', 'sabotaged', 'Can', 'neighboring', 'Sheriff', 'chase', 'Pardee', 'McNairy', 'county', 'Buford', 'ran', 'background', 'check', 'Graduate', 'Student', 'Can', 'lead', 'Buford', ""n't"", 'fooled', 'away', 'Witter', 'associates', 'one', 'last', 'chance', 'else', 'neighboring', 'county', 'Sheriff', 'Buford', 'can', 'setup', 'roadblock', 'stop', 'car', 'road', 'Can', 'set', 'up', 'roadblock', 'river', 'Sheriff', 'still', 'Boss', 'Dodson', 'speedboat', 'river', 'log', 'Margaret', 'Dobson', 'hospital', 'Can', 'escape', 'Federal', 'official', 'investigating', 'Dobson', 'now', 'are', 'shots', 'car', 'chase', '[', 'out', 'film', ']', 'Margaret', 'talks', 'Buford', 'word', 'cover', 'boarding', 'house', 'Ray', 'Henry', 'trapped', 'off', 'shot', 'going', 'down', 'Buford', 'ambulance', 'again', 'Later', 'see', 'what', 'happend', 'Did', 'make', 'look', 'accident', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'changed', 'dramatic', 'effect', 'Many', 'rural', 'people', 'only', 'work', 'par-time', 'seasonal', 'look', 'other', 'jobs', 'scrape', 'can', 'be', 'tempted', 'work', 'illegal', 'activity', 'story', 'organized', 'crime', 'big', 'cities', 'Ever', 'wonder', 'why', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'movies', 'organized', 'crime', 'big', 'cities', 'did', '1930s']",N/A

722649,AT57B36BHDQ00,B00006RJAR,Big Mike,"[0, 0]","Apparently Joe Don Baker wanted to do other things, so Bo Svenson replaced him in this follow-up to Walking Tall. Originally, the real Buford Pusser was actually signed to portray himself in this film but died in a car crash within 24-hours of signing the contract. The film was originally to be called ""Buford"". Bo Svenson is a better and more versatile actor than Joe Don Baker, although Baker became a friend of Buford Pusser and his family. Today, Buford's daughter Dwana is still in contact with him. According to her book ""Walking On"", Dwana got her feelings hurt by Bo Svenson the first time they met when he told that she ""should go on a diet"". She said the producers forced him to apologize to her. I had the honor of meeting Mrs. Helen Pusser (Buford's mother) in June 1979 and she told me that she didn't care for Bo Svenson after he told the family to call him ""MR. Svenson"". Maybe this film was not as successful as the original because it was pretty well ""sanitized"" of the graphic violence and nudity that Walking Tall became so well-known for. This film was rated ""PG"" when it was first released in 1975 but would probably get a ""PG-13"" today.

We know what he is going to do and what is going to happen before it is even hinted at on the screen. Then the pleasure comes only from the way the various tricks happen and the succession of them. We know there will be dynamite in the car, that he will lose a wheel, that the car will have a crash, just to speak of the car. And that is what happens. Now the details and the particulars are for you to discover them in the film. That he may be baited by some dumb woman is obvious and has to come but we know that he has already seen through her and that he knows he is being dragged into a trap. Now, how is he going to get out of it? That's what you must discover by yourself. And don't worry he will get the main trafficker but how is another story. A speed boat is no match to our busy beaver on the river. We also know when he is going to be wounded. They did not know what bullet-proof jackets were in those days. It's true recently it was discovered that some GIs did not have that kind of equipment in Iraq. But what is the meaning of such a film? This insistence on hunting the traffickers and this blindness that does not see that it is the prohibition that creates the problem. But the film is a constant and perfect illustration that there is no value what so ever that can stand in the way of this moralistic crusade against the forces of evil. Why not simply legalize these goods so that they can be properly observed and under surveillance? When something is not illegal or pushed out of the way it is all the less fun to use them, to do them.

He is so effective that the mob is desperate to get him and hires a variety of hit men to do the job.

The movie Bo Svenson walked into (for an up and coming actor) was no where near the opportunity that Joe Don Baker had. We hope to see the bigger more imposing Svenson on a rampage to club, beat and shoot those responsible for his wife's death, but we don't because they are out of his reach. He hardly even gets to yell at anyone in this. Bo Svenson's best role as Buford Pusser is not W.T. part 2 or 3, it is the walking tall t.v. series with more action and drama providing Bo a chance to show he could do the part as good as Joe don Baker. Pusser gets out of the hospital and faces all kinds of attempts on his life while trying to catch moonshiners. I still like this film because it is based on fact, and somehow it is very believable. Luke Askew, Richard jaekel do a good job as bad guys.
