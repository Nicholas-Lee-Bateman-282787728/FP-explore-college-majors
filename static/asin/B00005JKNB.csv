589797,AO3JW5VHT2GQ,B00005JKNB,A Customer,"[1, 1]","I liked this film.Synopsis:Jim Carrey plays Peter Appleton, a Hollywood film writer who is accused of Communist affiliations.  He knows the accusation is going to ruin his career as a writer.  In coping with this realization he gets drunk, goes for a drive, gets in an accident, and hits his head.  The knock to the head results in temporary amnesia.  When he is found, he is taken to the town of Lawson, CA where it just so happens that the town has lost 50-60 young men in World War II and one of them, Luke Trimble, just happens to be a spitting image of Jim Carey's character.  The father of Luke Trimble, Harry Trimble (played by Martin Landau), happens to see Peter (though Peter has forgotten his name and his past life) and believes that his son whose body was never found in the war has returned home.Harry owns The Majestic, a now defunct movie theater that doubles as their home.  Well, Luke's return to Lawson creates something of an uproar as all of his old friends and his old flame, Adelle, played by Laurie Holden, all renew their relationships with him.  Luke helps get The Majestic running again only to have one of the movies that he wrote play in the theater.  When it does, his memory finally comes back.What I haven't mentioned is the counter-plot that is running throughout the whole movie.  The Communist Activities Committee (that isn't the actual name, I forget it now) is trying to find Peter Appleton for being a Communist sympathizer.  Well, it just so happens that Harry dies the night that Luke/Peter realizes who he is.  The day they bury Harry is the day Peter reveals himself to Adelle and the Communist Activities Committee finally finds him.  When they find him it is a big social event and the entire town of Lawson is disillusioned by it.Peter has to testify before the committee.  Adelle tries to convince him to deny the charges but when they separate Peter seems to be willing to read a statement saying he has severed his ties with the communists and then rat out several other Hollywood figures.  Well, Adelle gives him a gift as he leaves, a copy of the U.S. Constitution and a letter from Luke.  This affects Peter and he ends up denying the charges and facing down the committee.  When he faces down the committee he is raised back up to a hero in the eyes of Lawson and Adelle.  He ends up returning to Lawson, running The Majestic, and marrying Adelle.My Comments:I liked the film because it had some memorable characters and made normal people the focus of the film rather than larger than life individuals.  The Usher for the Majestic, Emmitt Smith played by Gerry Black was one such character.  He was simple yet profound.  I like characters like that.  Also, Harry Trimble, played by Martin Landau, was also a simple and profound character.When the focus of the movie was on Lawson and the feelings of a town that has suffered so much, the movie made a great statement on the consequences of war and the importance of relationships in our lives.When the movie switched back to the obvious political statement of Jim Carey's character before the investigating committee, the movie lost some of its glow.  Movies that have to tell you what they are trying to say often miss the point.Overall, the movie was fun to watch.  The tension that floated in the background from the individuals looking for Peter Appleton kept the movie moving even though it wasn't integrated as much as it could have been.",3,Entertaining but with political overtones,1042329600,"01 12, 2003",2003,3448,"['liked', 'film.Synopsis', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'Peter', 'Appleton', 'Hollywood', 'film', 'writer', 'who', 'accused', 'Communist', 'affiliations', 'accusation', 'going', 'ruin', 'career', 'writer', 'coping', 'realization', 'drunk', 'drive', 'accident', 'head', 'knock', 'head', 'results', 'temporary', 'amnesia', 'When', 'found', 'taken', 'town', 'Lawson', 'CA', 'where', 'just', 'so', 'town', 'lost', '50-60', 'young', 'men', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'one', 'Luke', 'Trimble', 'just', 'be', 'spitting', 'image', 'Jim', 'Carey', 'character', 'father', 'Luke', 'Trimble', 'Harry', 'Trimble', 'played', 'Martin', 'Landau', 'see', 'Peter', 'Peter', 'forgotten', 'name', 'past', 'life', 'son', 'body', 'was', 'never', 'found', 'war', 'returned', 'home.Harry', 'Majestic', 'now', 'defunct', 'movie', 'theater', 'home', 'Well', 'Luke', 'return', 'Lawson', 'something', 'uproar', 'old', 'friends', 'old', 'flame', 'Adelle', 'played', 'Laurie', 'Holden', 'renew', 'relationships', 'Luke', 'get', 'Majestic', 'running', 'again', 'only', 'have', 'one', 'movies', 'wrote', 'play', 'theater', 'When', 'memory', 'finally', 'have', ""n't"", 'mentioned', 'counter-plot', 'running', 'whole', 'movie', 'Communist', 'Activities', 'Committee', ""n't"", 'actual', 'name', 'forget', 'now', 'trying', 'find', 'Peter', 'Appleton', 'being', 'Communist', 'sympathizer', 'Well', 'just', 'so', 'Harry', 'night', 'Luke/Peter', 'who', 'day', 'bury', 'Harry', 'day', 'Peter', 'Adelle', 'Communist', 'Activities', 'Committee', 'finally', 'When', 'find', 'big', 'social', 'event', 'entire', 'town', 'Lawson', 'disillusioned', 'it.Peter', 'testify', 'committee', 'Adelle', 'convince', 'deny', 'charges', 'when', 'separate', 'Peter', 'be', 'willing', 'read', 'statement', 'saying', 'severed', 'ties', 'communists', 'then', 'rat', 'out', 'several', 'other', 'Hollywood', 'figures', 'Well', 'Adelle', 'gift', 'copy', 'U.S.', 'Constitution', 'letter', 'Luke', 'Peter', 'up', 'denying', 'charges', 'facing', 'down', 'committee', 'When', 'down', 'committee', 'raised', 'back', 'hero', 'eyes', 'Lawson', 'Adelle', 'up', 'returning', 'Lawson', 'running', 'Majestic', 'marrying', 'Adelle.My', 'Comments', 'liked', 'film', 'had', 'memorable', 'characters', 'made', 'normal', 'people', 'focus', 'film', 'rather', 'larger', 'life', 'individuals', 'Usher', 'Majestic', 'Emmitt', 'Smith', 'played', 'Gerry', 'Black', 'was', 'one', 'such', 'character', 'was', 'simple', 'yet', 'like', 'characters', 'Also', 'Harry', 'Trimble', 'played', 'Martin', 'Landau', 'was', 'also', 'simple', 'profound', 'character.When', 'focus', 'movie', 'was', 'Lawson', 'feelings', 'town', 'suffered', 'so', 'much', 'movie', 'made', 'great', 'statement', 'consequences', 'war', 'importance', 'relationships', 'lives.When', 'movie', 'switched', 'back', 'obvious', 'political', 'statement', 'Jim', 'Carey', 'character', 'investigating', 'committee', 'movie', 'lost', 'glow', 'Movies', 'have', 'tell', 'what', 'are', 'trying', 'say', 'often', 'point.Overall', 'movie', 'was', 'fun', 'watch', 'tension', 'floated', 'background', 'individuals', 'looking', 'Peter', 'Appleton', 'kept', 'movie', 'moving', 'even', 'was', ""n't"", 'integrated', 'as', 'much', 'could', 'have', 'been']",N/A

A period piece that looks and feels authentic to its core, The Majestic is a touching story about lives affected by World War 2 as well as the McCarthy Era when witch-hunting for Communists hurt many innocent folks.  Jim Carrey is spot-on in his two roles.  In the beginning of the film, we are introduced to Peter Appleton who is a good-time guy/Hollywood screenwriter.  After a car-accident induces amnesia, he surfaces in a small town and becomes recognized as WW2 hero Luke Trimble.  Appleton unknowingly assumes Trimble's life.  It's a story of big city America and small town USA, a tale of redemption and belief in American ideals and values and what we hold most dear.  Most of all it's a story about heroism that is epic as well as small everyday acts that serve to make our lives better.  I cannot imagine anyone more skilled and talented than Jim Carrey to play these roles.  I believe this film may very well be his greatest role as an actor, for he makes us laugh and cry, sometimes simultaneously.

589800,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B00005JKNB,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[0, 17]","While most will argue that The Majestic was an opportunity for famed director Frank Darabont to pay homage to the infamous films of Frank Capra, this critic felt it was more an opportunity for Darabont to successfully clich&eacute; every recycled element in Hollywood cinema with the sole purpose of making us feel sympathetic to an unimaginative character.  The Majestic tried too hard to keep the audience's attention.  The Majestic tried to hard to give us a fictional town where realism was taken from the same page as Pleasantville.  The Majestic attempted to give Jim Carrey the opportunity to win an Oscar, but as we learn from Jack Nicholson, one sometimes cannot just calm the face to fully embrace a dramatic role.  My point is that The Majestic tried too hard, thus forcing the film to transform from a sentimental piece of nostalgia, to just sheer rubbish.  While Darabont tried to capture the spirit of 1950s Hollywood in this film, what in fact occurred was simple one dimensional characters that we cared nothing for, events that took place that seemed misplaced from reality, and emotions that escaped honesty forcing us to sit through two plus hours of pure, 100% uncut, Darabont drivel.Take a brief moment and go through the internet to watch the trailer to this film.  Just as I write this review, I find myself looking at what I thought this film was going to center around to suddenly realizing what Darabont actually gave me.  To be utterly frank, this is not a film about a theater.  Sure, one would assume from both the poster as well as the trailer that it may be about a man suffering from amnesia goes to a small town to rejuvenate an independent theater.  As a man who dreams of similar ideas (sans the amnesia), I was ready to enjoy this feature.  I was even willing to give Carrey a chance because he had proven to me over time that he could handle a meatier roll.  Alas, when the final credits finally did run for this film, I did not see The Majestic as the film that was promised to me.  I was expecting an American version of Cinema Paradiso, but instead found myself with more recycled Hollywood mumbo-jumbo that I could wave a stick at.  The story was profoundly old, with Carrey doing nothing to re-establish his character.  As I look back at his performance, he didn't grab anything by the horns, he didn't push his character to the limit, what he attempted to do was gain audience support by being less comic/zany and more ""human"", but for me you could see right though his performance.  In a year worth of decent performers making their mark in Hollywood, Carrey's performance of Peter Appleton was about as transparent as a ghost and will not remain relevant through the test of time.As I sit here and nitpick this film, I begin to realize that The Majestic was not the best that Darabont has to offer.  I would argue that The Shawshank Redemption was a pure moment of cinematic intelligence, and that perhaps when Darabont joins forces with Stephen King, the work is pure film magic, but when it comes to creating other work, it just seems to fall into the pan of lest resistance.  My major issue with this film was the surfacing of smaller issues like Carrey's nonchalant performance, the ridiculous nature of the town of Lawson (and the clich&eacute; characters that seemed to inhabit the streets), and the over-played ending speech which seemed like a cut-and-paste of nearly ever other ""courtroom"" drama ever produced.  It just felt uncreative from beginning to end.  There were hardly any surprises or moments that had you gripping your seat with anticipation.  Darabont played it safe, but the final result ended up being a jumbled mess of already used clich&eacute;s.  I wish I could list them all for you, but as a man who has seen his fair share of movies, I could count the beats with my eyes closed in this film.  I knew when he was going to crash, I knew there was going to be a love interest, I knew Carrey would be faced with emotion, and I knew that eventually he would have to defend himself to everyone that we found our eyes surrounding.  I knew these events were going to happen, and I am sure that anyone that has seen more than two films in their lifetime would see the same.  Creativity, imagination, and energy are three core elements needed to make a film go from average to cult-remembering ... but The Majestic had none of these traits, so it falls into the wayside of being found in a dollar bin within the year.As I read my lines for this review, a name seems to resonate deeply within these words that utterly describe why this feature failed.  I use the word ""fail"", because it was not a memorable to any extent.  The acting was laughable and the story was as generic as Grade-A cheese, and while others may blame Carrey or the writer for such errors, this critic blames Frank Darabont.  I see that he was trying to redefine an era of cinema, but why, as a man who loves movies from the 1940s, is this film so terrible to view?  I do not believe that Darabont was able to capture the raw nature of the period.  I don't believe that Mayberry is on every corner and that every film made in the 50s represented this fake life.  He over dramatized the smaller events while completely missing his mark on the bigger moments.  This film could have benefited from a small war scene, or possibly from a visitation from Luke himself near the end.  I just needed something to spark my interest more than what was presented here.  I felt cheated from this film because it gave up midway through and did not push the limits of filmmaking.  While I don't expect that with every movie Hollywood releases, there is a level of expectation with a Darabont film which wasn't included here.  Mediocrity is what paid the Darabont bill in this feature.Overall, I wasn't impressed with this film in any way.  The cinematography wasn't even worth mentioning because it was so far below the level of mediocrity I found myself deeply sleeping instead of enjoying the clich&eacute; moments that Darabont had to offer.  Again, I cannot state that if you have seen two films ever in your life, you have already seen at least 8/9ths of this film.  That is about the level of creativity and excitement provided.  If you are a die-hard Carrey fan, I still don't think that you will find any excitement or enjoyment from this feature.  Carrey doesn't go crazy, but maybe he should have for the audience members that were nearly asleep.  What a poor, sad excuse for a film!Grade: ** out of *****",2,I thought this was a democracy.,1161129600,"10 18, 2006",2006,6534,"['most', 'will', 'argue', 'Majestic', 'was', 'opportunity', 'famed',

His character is sober, thoughtful, a refreshing change for viewers and clear evidence that Mr. Carrey is far more than the rubber-faced buffoon he's been typecast into.SYNOPSIS--In a story set in 1951, Peter Appleton (Carrey) is a screenwriter whose second film has been shelved by the studio when he's wrongly accused of being a Communist sympathizer. After a drunken wallow in self-pity and a long drive to nowhere in particular, Peter's late model convertible slides off a slick wooden bridge and into the river. He barely escapes drowning but sustains a concussion that we soon learn has caused severe amnesia. Peter is found on shore in a semi-conscious state by Stan Keller (Whitmore) and is brought into the small town of Lawson.Sheriff Coleman (Briscoe) mistakes the bewildered accident survivor for Lucas Trimble, a WWII hero who's been missing since shortly after D-Day, when he heroically saved 8 men from his platoon. Lucas's dad, Harry Trimble (Landau) is certain his son has returned from the dead. So is the war hero's girlfriend Adele (Stanton), plus just about everyone in town.Try as he may, ""Lucas"" can't remember anybody, but he entertains the idea that all these strangers are correct about him. Harry and Lucas refurbish the family business, an Art Deco-era movie palace called The Majestic, and they re-open with Gene Kelly'sAN AMERICAN IN PARIS(1951) as the first feature. Meanwhile, men from Lucas/Peter's past slowly unravel the mystery of the screenwriter's disppearance.When Peter's first film, ""Sands of the Sahara"" plays the Majestic, it triggers deep memories in Lucas, who's able to recite dialogue he's supposedly never heard before.

589808,ALR35EFI69S5R,B00005JKNB,"Barron Laycock ""Labradorman""","[9, 12]","I found this rather light-hearted romantic comedy quite entertaining, and one of the aspects I enjoyed most about it was the unusual dramatic direction in which comedian Jim Carrey seems to be going with such efforts as this one and his recent triumphant portrayal of the title character in ""Truman"". Once again Carrey neatly uses his considerable talents in more subtle ways than when chasing laughs in such slapstick efforts as ""Ace Ventura, Pet Detective"" or ""Dumb and Dumber"", and the result here is a very pleasing, and much more mellow movie.Of course, Carrey is supported in all this with a whimsical story and a strong supporting cast, including veteran character actor Martin Landau as the father so desperate to find his lost son he is left clutching at the straw Carrey's character represents. ALso terrific are Bob Balaban and Hal Holbrook. Also noteworthy here is the lovely Laurie Holden, who delivers a wonderful and fairly complex performance as a no-nonsense woman whose heart slowly finds itself surrendering to Carrey's lost boy charm. Expect to hear much more from her in the near term future, as she has absolutely everything it will take to be a major leading lady.Of course, this is a 1940s type movie, much like the feel-good stuff Hollywood once seemed to discharge with impish regularity from noted directors like Frank Capra and many others as well. And the use of the Hollywood blacklist here adds strength and purpose to the character's amnesia and recovery that it otherwise wouldn't have. After all, the fact that he was running away from something is a critically important aspect of the story, so using the blacklisting of artists so common in the early fifties is an interesting sidebar to the events transpiring on the screen.However, I found the Washington hearing sequences to be out of place and much too shrill to be included with the movie. I believe the issue could have been handled in another way and not detract from the main story line being developed and grown before us. This ends up being a bittersweet statement on life, and how one can make it be what one wants and needs it to be, if only one has the strength, courage, and imagination to live it at the edge, taking the risks needed to make it work. I found myself smiling as the final credits came up, and glad to have witnessed Carrey's growth into a much more substantial actor and artist than I had thought he was capable of being. Hopefully he will continue along these lines, taking the risks he needs to take to fulfill his beckoning promise as a dramatic artist.",5,Wonderful and Whimsical Film!,1032220800,"09 17, 2002",2002,2572,"['found', 'rather', 'light-hearted', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'quite', 'entertaining', 'one', 'aspects', 'enjoyed', 'most', 'was', 'unusual', 'dramatic', 'direction', 'comedian', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'be', 'going', 'such', 'efforts', 'one', 'recent', 'triumphant', 'portrayal', 'title', 'character', 'Truman', 'Once', 'again', 'Carrey', 'neatly', 'considerable', 'talents', 'more', 'subtle', 'ways', 'when', 'chasing', 'laughs', 'such', 'slapstick', 'efforts', 'Ace', 'Ventura', 'Pet', 'Detective', 'Dumb', 'Dumber', 'result', 'here', 'very', 'pleasing', 'much', 'more', 'mellow', 'movie.Of', 'course', 'Carrey', 'supported', 'whimsical', 'story', 'strong', 'supporting', 'cast', 'including', 'veteran', 'character', 'actor', 'Martin', 'Landau', 'father', 'so', 'desperate', 'find', 'lost', 'son', 'left', 'clutching', 'straw', 'Carrey', 'character', 'ALso', 'terrific', 'are', 'Bob', 'Balaban', 'Hal', 'Holbrook', 'Also', 'noteworthy', 'here', 'lovely', 'Laurie', 'Holden', 'who', 'wonderful', 'fairly', 'complex', 'performance', 'no-nonsense', 'woman', 'heart', 'slowly', 'surrendering', 'Carrey', 'lost', 'boy', 'charm', 'Expect', 'hear', 'much', 'more', 'near', 'term', 'future', 'absolutely', 'everything', 'will', 'take', 'be', 'major', 'leading', 'lady.Of', 'course', '1940s', 'type', 'movie', 'much', 'feel-good', 'stuff', 'Hollywood', 'once', 'seemed', 'discharge', 'impish', 'regularity', 'noted', 'directors', 'Frank', 'Capra', 'many', 'others', 'as', 'well', 'use', 'Hollywood', 'blacklist', 'here', 'strength', 'purpose', 'character', 'amnesia', 'recovery', 'otherwise', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'fact', 'was', 'running', 'away', 'something', 'critically', 'important', 'aspect', 'story', 'using', 'blacklisting', 'artists', 'so', 'common', 'early', 'fifties', 'interesting', 'sidebar', 'events', 'transpiring', 'screen.However', 'found', 'Washington', 'hearing', 'sequences', 'be', 'place', 'much', 'too', 'shrill', 'be', 'included', 'movie', 'believe', 'issue', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'handled', 'way', 'not', 'detract', 'main', 'story', 'line', 'being', 'developed', 'grown', 'up', 'being', 'bittersweet', 'statement', 'life', 'how', 'one', 'can', 'make', 'be', 'what', 'one', 'be', 'only', 'one', 'strength', 'courage', 'imagination', 'live', 'edge', 'taking', 'risks', 'needed', 'make', 'work', 'found', 'smiling', 'final', 'credits', 'came', 'up', 'glad', 'have', 'witnessed', 'Carrey', 'growth', 'much', 'more', 'substantial', 'actor', 'artist', 'had', 'thought', 'was', 'capable', 'being', 'Hopefully', 'will', 'continue', 'lines', 'taking', 'risks', 'take', 'fulfill', 'beckoning', 'promise', 'dramatic', 'artist']",N/A

First the overrated, whimsical slop that was THE TRUMAN SHOW and then the above average biopic MAN ON THE MOON in which nobody learns anything, because nobody knew much about Andy Kaufman to begin with. THE MAJESTIC is Jim's third shot at mainstream respectability, and though it wants to be a Capra homage, despite Carrey's good performance the movie is sloppy, tiresome, poorly constructed and has enough sticky sweet sentiment to have diabetics upchucking for a week.Carrey plays Peter Appleton, a Hollywood screenwriter in the 50s who finds himself blacklisted just as his career is starting to take off. Not surprisingly Pete is none too pleased about this so he decides a spot of drink driving is called for. He soon crashes his car off a bridge, escapes virtually unscathed and ends up in a small town called Lawson with a severe case of memory loss. Here an old man (Martin Landau) mistakes him for his son, Luke Trimble; a missing WW2 hero. This miracle inspires the town to reopen the town's long defunct Majestic movie theatre and rediscover the joy in their lives. Give me a break!Director/ producer Frank Darabont must have spent many days umming and ahhing over this project, but then somebody probably pointed out to him that he still needs to work until Stephen King writes another novel set in a prison.

589815,A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV,B00005JKNB,Bobby Underwood,"[2, 2]","Frank Darabont created this very undervalued and wonderful film, and if you listen carefully to this nostalgic piece of filmmaking, you can hear the faint echos of Frank Capra's voice. The lush cinematography with its colorful hues help create and enhance a very special movie that will leave you wondering why films like this don't get made anymore. Perhaps it's because they don't get the credit they deserve.Jim Carrey completely loses himself in a quiet and underplayed performance in a role which might easily have garnered him an Oscar if anyone had been watching. This is an old-style film and Carrey gives an old-style performance as Peter Appleton. After an horrific car accident, he loses his memory and is at first mistaken, then embraced, by an entire town, as Luke. Luke is the  long-missing and beloved son of both the town and Martin Landau, who gives a wonderful performance opposite Carrey.Adele Stanton is amazing as Laurie Holden. She is Luke's girlfriend and touchstone for all that is good about smalltown America in the 1950's. James Whitmore and David Ogden Stiers are just two of the many faces you will recognize in this magnificent film. The entire town comes together to help restore its once great movie theatre, ""The Majestic"", where magic once occurred every time the lights went dim. Like any Frank Capra film, Darabont's movie takes its time unfolding. The basic story is surrounded by small insights into ourselves and how we live. Does what people expect of us make us better? If we become better than who we were, where do we belong then? Peter will have to answer these questions when he remembers who he is, because he has grown to love Laurie and his father, Martin Landau. He may, in fact, no longer be Peter, at least not the old Peter.The town who feels betrayed by their favorite son is not the only problem Peter/Luke must deal with. Political markers of the era are a minor distraction for the viewer, as Peter returns to face a senate committee. Who he is now, rather than who he was before, may change how he answers their questions. Once he figures out where he belongs, he must find out if he can live a life of his own choosing. This long and beautiful film is truly special. The last ten minutes of this old-style masterpiece reminds us of all that is good about the movies.

The story has been recapped many times, so I won't do that here.The story keeps you wondering what is really going on, and how they can possibly resolve it. With the tendency of many screen writers to paint themselves into a corner in recent years, and come up with really stupid ways out, it is to the credit of these writers that their ending both makes sense and is quite satisfying.The acting is honest and quite moving. If you don't get choked up at least a time or two while viewing the movie, you'd have to be made of stone. In my mind this may be Jim Carrey's best acting performance. This is one of the few movies that I will watch every time it happens to come to my attention when it airs, despite the fact that I own the DVD.Sadly, the DVD itself could be better. The specs above claim that it is presented in 1.85:1, but I don't think that is correct. True 1.85:1 should show a bit of letterbox effect even on a wide-screen television, and this presentation does not. The ""Deleted Scenes"" are in letterbox ... it would have been nice if the entire movie was presented that way.As far as special features, they are few but enjoyable. If you greatly enjoyed the movie as we did, then the Deleted Scenes will fill in a couple of gaps, but you can easily see why they were left out of a movie that already ran to 2 and 1/2 hours.There is also an extended clip of the ""movie within the movie"", Sand Pirates of the Sahara, which we thought was delightful.There are no commentaries. This is the same lackluster DVD product that WB was infamous for back during the years in which they produced this one. For some reason it took WB a while to really ""get"" the DVD movie customer. They seemed to think that packaging a DVD product much as they'd package a syndicated movie to a TV station was good enough, and it wasn't.Still, some of those movies are worth owning and watching despite the poor job done by WB, and there aren't any other options available to get them.

I also really like Jim Carrey, Martin Landau, and the beautiful Laurie Holden.  On top of that, I saw The Majestic with friends at a free screening at the nicest theater I've ever been in.Given the same conditions, I enjoyed seeing A Knight's Tale (free screening, great theater, friends, some funny parts), even though it's a silly movie I would never rent.  These conditions couldn't save The Majestic.With a great director and great performances, what made The Majestic horrible?  It has to be the story.  The Majestic was written by Michael Sloane, whose only other writing credit is co-writing Hollywood Boulevard II.  Ever heard of it?  I hadn't, but reviews say it's bad and monotonous, like The Majestic.The Majestic is a 152-minute flim with a 90-minute story.  After Jim Carrey gets amnesia, nothing happens for a full hour.  I remember seeing the camera pan across the town and appreciating the cinematography for a split-second, but wishing I was tired enough to fall asleep until things picked up.  Eventually we flash back to the evil UAAC people who are looking for Mr. Carrey, and there is hope that something may happen soon, but we immediately go back to the small town with nothing going on for about another half hour.Finally, we get to the courtroom scene, and I'm praying that the movie will redeem itself.  It was ridiculous.  Jim Carrey keeps talking and talking, continually interrupting the judge who is banging away with his gavel, telling him to be quiet, telling him he's out of order, threatening him, etc.  Is he removed?  No!  The banging just goes on and on to the point of utter absurdity.  I eventually expected Jim Carrey to return with, ""I'm out of order?

It tapped into our collective memories of two men who met those goals, Jimmy Stewart acting in any of the numerous films he did for director Frank Capra. Jim Carrey has done a lot of excellent work, most of it comedic.  He is on more uncertain territory when he tries leading man romantic and/or dramatic roles as he does here.  This film often goes over the edge into downright corny.  Capra and Stewart always played dangerously close to the edge themselves on the corny aspect but managed to just pull their films off anyway. The plot is that Carrey loses his memory after an auto crash.  He has just lost his job as a Hollywood screenwriter (1950s) because he's (almost laughably) a suspected Communist. He finds himself in a small town north of Hollywood where the citizens all &quot;recongize&quot; him as a local boy lost in World War II who has returned home.  Not having any other memory, Carrey believes it too and begins to lead a halcyon existence in a town that is too good to be true.

It just goes on and on and on, an Energizer Bunny of a movie that finally feels as if it's never going to end.Jim Carrey gives one of his solid, non-mugging engaging performances when the audience can actually care about his character, rather than marveling over the remarkable fashion in which he can contort his features. The stand-out performance is given by Martin Landau as the father who believes his war-hero son has returned in the form of amnesiac Carrey.The movie is a paean to good old-fashioned American virtues, complete with a climactic scene where Carrey gets to give a rah-rah speech before the House Committee on UnAmerican Activities about true values--as close to mom's apple pie as you can get. While it's intended to be a reminder of a time (the 50s) that was supposedly kinder and gentler, the net effect is to make the viewer grateful for the present. As well, there is an extended scene when the town of Lawson celebrates Carrey's return with a great big outdoor party. Carrey and his former fiancee are invited to lead off the dancing to Acker Bilk's &quot;Stranger on the Shore&quot; -- a song that wasn't written until 1962.

I can sort of understand the myriad of cynical comments from some of you- because it's fashionable to dislike anything that's too sentimental these days (though I'm not amongst those who do), but I also think the story has a certain root of nasty, ugly 'reality' which gives the film a balance. Remember, Jim Carrey's screenwriter is thrown into a rather spectacular series of events which end up with him taking an adventure in an almost latter-day Wonderland. A credit to his dramatic acting ability, he has a kind of wary disconnection throughout the whole film. (Even as he lives amongst all the virtue, idealism and patriotism of the Lawson citizens he does not seem to entirely believe it.) But every Oz must have its Kansas, and even Carrey 'wakes up' towards the end of the film to deal with the ugliness of the HUAC witch-hunt. But my favorite performer- and indeed the best thing in the movie- is Martin Landau. His patriarch who wears his heart on his sleeve is absolutely stunning throughout, and he gives the story a lot of earnestness and optimism (especially when he talks about the magic of movies- which I admit I kind of agree with).

His life starts to fall apart-but the audience (and those around him in the movie) sees what a good and standup character he really is.  Time comes to face his accusers.  In a fit of indignation and outrage our man sets the whole thing right making everyone come to terms with their higher principles and bring shame to those who tried to bring him low.The problem with this storyline is that it tries to say two contradictory things at once.  On the one hand, ""how dare you accuse him (me or them) of harboring such nefarious and dark sentiments"".  On the other hand, ""well, even if I were a communist, what harm is there in that.  I am an American and I am entitled to think and say what I want.  Maybe I'm a better American for doing just that!""Well, which is it?  Either one is saying that being an ""enemy of liberty"" is such a serious charge that no one should be accused carelessly or lightly or one is saying that the only ""enemies of liberty"" are those who suspect there are subversives among us.It always amuses me that Hollywood on this score doesn't have the courage of its convictions.  The main character is always someone unfairly accused of being a communist-never someone who is an actual communist himself.  Many believe there is nothing inherently unpatriotic or un-American in being a communist.  This belief is not uncommon and many Americans honorably believe it.  If that is so, why not make the point even clearer by making the main character a young idealistic communist who simply wants justice for even the least of us?The dirty secret is that as much as we may profess freedom of thought and pluralism in the land of liberty we instinctively know that some are beyond the pale.  Instead of a communist, make the main character a nazi and you will see the storyline all falls apart.  Any one is perfectly free in this land of freedom to believe that Adolph Hitler was on to something.  But by any definition of what it means to believe in America, such a belief in Hitler is corrosive and reprehensible.  It may be wise to barely tolerate Nazis among us instead of outlawing them; but we cannot hide from the fact that as such Nazism is and has been dangerous and lethal.When it comes to communism and communists in America, for all their sufferings--both real and imagined--, those who were actual communists, those who flirted with communism, those who were sympathetic and those who were just along for the ride have yet to be called to account.  For all their high idealism and good intentions, what they actually advocated, brought and defended was a system which crushed the defenseless, imprisoned many, starved more, and denied liberties to all in its reach.  Tens of millions were killed and untold human misery was unleashed all in the name of a more perfect society.Undoubtedly, many good people were communists and all in all they should have been left alone.  But it should be remembered that as these ""good people"" basked in their ""good intentions"" evil was committed in their names.  The term is  ""witch-hunt"" frequently used in talking about the 1950's.  Among the many things the use of the term implies is that ""of course, there are no such things as witches"".  The trouble is that any fair observation of those times would admit that there were such ""witches"".  It is a lie to suggest there weren't.",2,SEEN IT ALL BEFORE,1057017600,"07 1, 2003",2003,3436,"['have', 'seen', 'movie', 'before', 'gem', 'guy', 'unjustly', 'accused', 'un-Americanism', 'life', 'fall', 'apart-but', 'audience', 'movie', 'what', 'good', 'standup', 'character', 'really', 'Time', 'face', 'accusers', 'fit', 'indignation', 'outrage', 'man', 'whole', 'thing', 'right', 'making', 'everyone', 'come', 'terms', 'higher', 'principles', 'bring', 'shame', 'who', 'tried', 'bring', 'low.The', 'problem', 'storyline', 'say', 'two', 'contradictory', 'things', 'once', 'one', 'hand', 'how', 'dare', 'accuse', 'harboring', 'such', 'nefarious', 'dark', 'sentiments', 'other', 'hand', 'well', 'even', 'were', 'communist', 'what', 'harm', 'there', 'am', 'American', 'am', 'entitled', 'think', 'say', 'what', 'want', 'Maybe', ""'m"", 'better', 'American', 'doing', 'just', 'Well', 'one', 'saying', 'being', 'enemy', 'liberty', 'serious', 'charge', 'one', 'should', 'be', 'accused', 'carelessly', 'lightly', 'one', 'saying', 'only', 'enemies', 'liberty', 'are', 'who', 'suspect', 'are', 'subversives', 'us.It', 'always', 'Hollywood', 'score', ""n't"", 'have', 'courage', 'convictions', 'main', 'character', 'always', 'someone', 'unfairly', 'accused', 'being', 'communist-never', 'someone', 'who', 'actual', 'communist', 'Many', 'believe', 'nothing', 'inherently', 'unpatriotic', 'un-American', 'being', 'communist', 'belief', 'not', 'uncommon', 'many', 'Americans', 'honorably', 'believe', 'so', 'why', 'not', 'make', 'point', 'even', 'clearer', 'making', 'main', 'character', 'young', 'idealistic', 'communist', 'who', 'simply', 'justice', 'even', 'least', 'dirty', 'secret', 'as', 'much', 'may', 'profess', 'freedom', 'thought', 'pluralism', 'land', 'liberty', 'instinctively', 'know', 'are', 'pale', 'Instead', 'communist', 'make', 'main', 'character', 'nazi', 'will', 'see', 'storyline', 'apart', 'one', 'perfectly', 'free', 'land', 'freedom', 'believe', 'Adolph', 'Hitler', 'was', 'something', 'definition', 'what', 'believe', 'America', 'such', 'belief', 'Hitler', 'corrosive', 'reprehensible', 'may', 'be', 'wise', 'barely', 'tolerate', 'Nazis', 'instead', 'outlawing', 'can', 'not', 'hide', 'fact', 'such', 'Nazism', 'been', 'dangerous', 'communism', 'communists', 'America', 'sufferings', 'real', 'imagined', 'who', 'were', 'actual', 'communists', 'who', 'flirted', 'communism', 'who', 'were', 'sympathetic', 'who', 'were', 'just', 'along', 'ride', 'have', 'yet', 'be', 'called', 'account', 'high', 'idealism', 'good', 'intentions', 'what', 'actually', 'advocated', 'brought', 'defended', 'was', 'system', 'crushed', 'defenseless', 'imprisoned', 'many', 'starved', 'more', 'denied', 'liberties', 'reach', 'Tens', 'millions', 'were', 'killed', 'untold', 'human', 'misery', 'was', 'unleashed', 'name', 'more', 'perfect', 'society.Undoubtedly', 'many', 'good', 'people', 'were', 'communists', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'left', 'alone', 'should', 'be', 'remembered', 'good', 'people', 'basked', 'good', 'intentions', 'evil', 'was', 'committed', 'names', 'term', 'witch-hunt', 'frequently', 'used', 'talking', '1950', 'many', 'things', 'use', 'term', 'implies', 'course', 'are', 'such', 'things', 'witches', 'trouble', 'fair', 'observation', 'times', 'would', 'admit', 'were', 'such', 'witches', 'lie', 'suggest', 'were', ""n't""]",N/A

He is all too well known as a wacky comedian, but it's about time people get the chance to see that he is a good actor and can do more than just stupid comedy. I was very impressed with his dramatic abilities. The visual re-creation used in this film is top quality. A very welcomed site in this era of hustle and bustle we live in. Very good production with a few errors to satisfy those who just live for finding mistakes in movies. Most of us realize that no production is perfect. I loved the plot in this film. Many of Carrey's other films lack this quality in a major way. A very human performance by someone we often see as a classic goof. A nice trip down memory lane. I highly recommend ""The Majestic"".

The film tackles alot of heavy themes(Post-war trauma, McCarthyism, etc.) that it seemed like it was straight-jacketed by it's lofty goals.  It would also help if director Frank Darabont would learn how to tighten up his stories.  This film and ""The Green Mile"" are good films but they're not ""War and Peace"".  Just as I was about to write this film off as a noble failure it rebounds with a strong last third.  The ending is Capra-esque but, hey, imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.  The film contains many nice moments but it's the little touches that resonated with me; the pictures of the town's young men lost in the great war, the unveiling of the statue commemorating the war casualties.  Jim Carrey, in an understated performance, hit's all the right notes as Peter Appleton, disgraced screenwriter mistaken for someone else.  Martin Landau was exceptional as Harry, the grieving father who want's to believe that Carrey is his son returning from war.

Shamelessly hard...and I don't know if anyone has seen any Capra...but he is famous for a reason...He is fairly simplistic (which makes it seem like it would be easy to replicate) but he is impossible to be..  In some ways, Frank Darabont seems like a good possibility to be Frank Capra, even more than the fact that they both have the same first name.  Darabont is unafraid of emotion, Darabont's films, especially The Shawshank Redemption, have always had that clear deliniation between good and evil.  This is very Capra...I give This film credit for trying .  It has some lovely performances.  Martin Landau is one of our greatest treasures.  Watch this and then watch Ed Wood and tell me it is the same guy.  Darabont loads the film with great faces...and a few wonderful characters.  This was certainly to be another of Carrey's adventures into serious acting...and he's good.  For me, and I know a little about watching actors, I think the journey for Jim Carrey has come too late.  I found myself waiting for the schtick...and since the films The Majestic is based on are filled with quirkiness I felt like Carrey was misplaced.  I actually think Carrey, in his shameless search for an oscar should do the Cruise/Williams approach and attach himself to an amazing character role, dare I say supporting actor...The Majestic ultimately falls short but is a marvelous time passer.  What Darabont and the script seem to forget is that Capra movies are about more than conquering the bad guy.  The film tries a little bit to give us people to care about, but it seems to be form over content.  In it's a wonderful Life,there is a shot of the building and loan book keeper totalling the money.  He is quirky, he is hilarious, and in that one shot,you care.  It is because for Capra, the exploration of the human condition was not an excercise or a star vehicle, it was the way he thought....the way he felt.So why four stars....???  Because for me, falling short of one of the world's most revered film makers seems ok.  You do have a film that was savaged by critics, but has some lovely atmosphere and joy to it.

In fact, ten (mentioned in the movie) did plead First not Fifth Amendment Rights, the Federal Courts denied that protection, all went to prison and, perhaps even more painful, were barred from the incomes they had had, some selling scripts using front men, who took most of the money and all the glory, some using pseudonyms, and, though formerly top writers in Hollywood, now took beggars wages, some saw their marriages destroyed, their families disrupted, their friends deserting them; it was, in fact, Hell. Some played the game and were shunned by former friends for the rest of their lives while being barred from any important Hollywood connection. Just watch the hearings of someone appointed to the Supreme Court whom the majority seriously want to prevent sitting on that Court.

589844,A3CWH6VKCTJAD,B00005JKNB,"""flickjunkie""","[1, 2]","This is a pleasant film that is more important for what it isn't than what it is.  There have been many comparisons between this film and the work of legendary director Frank Capra.  That is easy to do because it is a very human story set in the 1940's and it ends with a congressional hearing that is reminiscent of ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington"".  However, Capra was always very black and white when it came to good and evil, with his heroes almost saintly and his villains dastardly and despicable.  This film has more gray overtones and flawed characters.  This is not necessarily a bad thing, but it does take it out of the realm of being truly Capraesque.Even more importantly, this film isn't another lowbrow gross out flick by Jim Carrey.  Carrey gives a likeable performance reminiscent of ""The Truman Show"", with not a hint of the repugnant and boorish behavior that made him famous.  I can only pray that despite the poor box office of this film, Carrey will attempt to build on this and move in the direction that Robin Williams went, toward more substantial screenplays and real acting.  His next project, ""The Children of the Dust Bowl"" is a true story of a professor who set up a school for kids in the Oklahoma dust bowl in the 1930's, so he seems to have changed his script selection criteria.  That would be a blessing as he is far too talented to be wasting his life on body fluid humor.The film itself is schmaltzy and nostalgic, but it gets a little strident at the end as it tries too hard to repudiate the blacklisting and red paranoia of the 1940's and 1950's. The blacklist storyline is discordant with the rest of the film and really adds nothing to the story.  Otherwise, it is an easy story to enjoy, although it is hard for the viewer to believe that anyone in this town could possibly have thought Peter Appleton (Carrey) was really Luke Trimble.  It is as if everyone really knew the truth, but they wanted to deceive themselves.Director Frank Darabont (""The Green Mile"", ""The Shawshank Redemption"") does a nice job on the period renderings (except not enough men in hats; hats were the rule for men during that period) with costumes and props that bring the times to life.The acting is very good.  I like Jim Carrey much better as a dramatic actor or a bittersweet comic than as a fatuous chuff.  Carrey is extremely affable as Peter, and plays the romantic parts with Laurie Holden well.  However, he is tentative in the Washington scenes, unable to summon up the resolute defiance necessary for the situation.  Martin Landau is terrific as Luke's father, bringing the character an almost delusional enthusiasm that is simultaneously charming and pathetic.  Laurie Holden also does a nice job of portraying Adele, taking a grounded character and slowly melting her emotionally as she falls in love with Luke/Peter.This is not a great film, but other than the political drum beating it is an agreeable (though improbable) feel good flick.  I rated it a 7/10.

589845,A2ZB8B7VQONZA6,B00005JKNB,"fmwaalex ""fmwaalex""","[2, 3]","THE MAJESTICOne of Jim Carrey's best films ever and one of his best performances takes place in this film set in 1950's Hollywood when filmmakers were getting blacklisted for supposed communist involvement. Now I am absolutely sure that some were but others were unjustly accused, a lot of people lost everything because of this. Of course whatever you believe you do have the right to do so whether right or wrong as long as no laws are broken. But that does not stop the powers that be from blacklisting Carrey's character in this film. This film is not only a showcase of that period in time but is also speaking to things that are happening now.Peter Appleton [Carrey] is on his way to becoming a very successful screenwriter with a new film called Ashes to Ashes. Add in that he is dating the lovely star of the film and things could not be looking better. But his bubble is busted when he learns that is time in the biz may be up, he has been blacklisted. Of course he is not a communist but that means nothing to the government, he once accidently sat in a communist meeting in college just to hang out with a girl. That one mistake that he made as a youth has come back to ruin his career and his life. Of course like anybody would do he gets drunk and tries to forget the pain, what a coincidence, he literally does.After getting into his car and having a few drinks he crashes on a bridge and tumbles into the water. It is here that he cracks his head and wakes up to a dog licking him. He has no idea where he is, how he got there, or even who he is. But the town he makes his way into seem to have an idea of who he is, and it is not a Hollywood writer. It is one of the town's lost sons Luke Trimble, this brings the town to life. But not everyone is happy to see Luke home and some just can't believe it. But Luke's father is convinced his war hero son is back and wants to reopen the family biz, a movie theater called The Majestic. As the town celebrates and Peter or Luke settles in his memory starts to creep back as the Government get closer to finding him.This has got to be one of Carrey's best performances without a doubt especially because no one at the time thought he could pull off a more serious role. Carrey shines without a doubt in what most critics bashed, goes to show what the so called professionals know. To be honest this should have at least won some Golden Globes, it is not the best movie ever but it is much better than what people give it credit for. Every person that appeared in this did a marvelous job from the people who played his father, girlfriend in the town, to all of the towns people they all did great. I should note that the movie wrote that he watches at the premiere stars none other than the great Bruce Campbell. Of Course Bruce is my all time favorite actor, one of the best ever.Directed by Frank Darabont who has made so many good movies does not disappoint in this wonderful film written by Michael Sloane. Sloane needs to write some more films because he did an excellent job with this film. If you have not seen this then you are cheating yourself out of a good film.

As such it is a masterpiece. We flash back to the McCarthy era when some politicians were obssessed and pbnubilated by a communist plot against America that never existed but in their warped minds. One film author is named by someone as a communist and he has to clear himself by naming some more people. He knows it is wrong by principle. He knows the names are those of people who have nothing to do with the accusation and who were at the most, like him maybe naive and certainly moved by the show of misery, suffering and war in the world. They were humane and nothing else and they used their plain constitutional rights to do something about it. The trick of this film is to make that person have an accident at the time of the accusation, lose his memory and assume the identity of a real war hero who was lost in action. The people of the little town of Lawson want him to assume that identity to give them their dream back, the dream of the America that has fought for the freedom of the human race in the world for three odd centuries. He is led into this situation by his loss of memory, though he recovers it at the very moment when the FBI and others catch up on him. As his real self he has no courage and is ready to play the game of the politicians to get his life back. As his assumed self he should fight for the Bill of Rights and the First Amendment even if he has to go to jail for it. The dense ending of the film is romantic about this situation and makes him make the good ethical choice, but that turns him into an untouchable hero. The film forgets that thousand of people suffered because of this short period of anticommunist bigotry in the head of a fundamentalist senator. Yet the film goes farther with a punchline at the very end, after he has recovered his job at the studio and his life, or nearly so. He realizes that filmmakers and film artists have another way of yielding : to produce some pitiful and pathetic stuff that loses human depth and replaces it with melodramatic images, and images are nothing but virtual emotions, no real deep-felt feelings and sentiments. You can imagine the return of the hero back to Lawson. If you can't do watch the film. Maybe you will come to the idea that our world would be a lot better if the powerful - and power is transient - stopped crucifying innocent victims. But fighting against victimization is a good good good thing to do : it provides you with a clear and shiny conscience.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",5,The Bill of Rights is the law of the heart,1103846400,"12 24, 2004",2004,2578,"['film', 'parabole', 'Bill', 'Rights', 'First', 'Amendment', 'US', 'Constitution', 'such', 'masterpiece', 'flash', 'back', 'McCarthy', 'era', 'when', 'politicians', 'were', 'obssessed', 'pbnubilated', 'communist', 'plot', 'America', 'never', 'existed', 'warped', 'minds', 'One', 'film', 'author', 'named', 'someone', 'communist', 'clear', 'naming', 'more', 'people', 'wrong', 'principle', 'names', 'are', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'nothing', 'do', 'accusation', 'who', 'were', 'most', 'maybe', 'naive', 'certainly', 'moved', 'show', 'misery', 'suffering', 'war', 'world', 'were', 'humane', 'nothing', 'else', 'used', 'plain', 'constitutional', 'rights', 'do', 'something', 'trick', 'film', 'make', 'person', 'have', 'accident', 'time', 'accusation', 'lose', 'memory', 'assume', 'identity', 'real', 'war', 'hero', 'who', 'was', 'lost', 'action', 'people', 'little', 'town', 'Lawson', 'want', 'assume', 'identity', 'give', 'dream', 'back', 'dream', 'America', 'fought', 'freedom', 'human', 'race', 'world', 'three', 'odd', 'centuries', 'led', 'situation', 'loss', 'memory', 'very', 'moment', 'when', 'FBI', 'others', 'catch', 'up', 'real', 'self', 'courage', 'ready', 'play', 'game', 'politicians', 'get', 'life', 'back', 'assumed', 'self', 'should', 'fight', 'Bill', 'Rights', 'First', 'Amendment', 'even', 'go', 'jail', 'dense', 'ending', 'film', 'romantic', 'situation', 'make', 'good', 'ethical', 'choice', 'untouchable', 'hero', 'film', 'thousand', 'people', 'suffered', 'short', 'period', 'anticommunist', 'bigotry', 'head', 'fundamentalist', 'senator', 'film', 'farther', 'punchline', 'very', 'end', 'recovered', 'job', 'studio', 'life', 'nearly', 'so', 'filmmakers', 'film', 'artists', 'have', 'way', 'yielding', 'produce', 'pitiful', 'pathetic', 'stuff', 'human', 'depth', 'replaces', 'melodramatic', 'images', 'images', 'are', 'nothing', 'virtual', 'emotions', 'real', 'deep-felt', 'feelings', 'sentiments', 'can', 'imagine', 'return', 'hero', 'back', 'Lawson', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'watch', 'film', 'Maybe', 'will', 'come', 'idea', 'world', 'would', 'be', 'lot', 'better', 'powerful', 'power', 'transient', 'stopped', 'crucifying', 'innocent', 'victims', 'fighting', 'victimization', 'good', 'good', 'good', 'thing', 'do', 'clear', 'shiny', 'conscience.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU']",N/A

The setting is the post-WW2 McCarthy Era, and Carrey is a young film writer who's about to be indicted for Communist activities even though he's only guilty of attending a ""food-not-war"" party while pursuing a girl during his college years. Distraught over what he knows will be the death of his burgeoning career, he drives up the California coast while contemplating his unfair fate, and is involved in an accident which leaves him with amnesia, embraced by the people in a small town that lost many of its young men to the war.  Carrey resembles a local war hero, who's been MIA for nine years; or perhaps the townspeople just want to believe he's survived, and adopt this stranger into their lives and hearts.  The long gone son of the man who owned the now-closed  Majestic cinema also comes with a gorgeous girlfriend with whom Carrey becomes involved, but it's all sweet, never perverse. Carrey never really believes he's who the locals think he is, but he goes along with it because he brings such joy to everyone around him.  The rebuilding of the theater is pure Capra and somehow manages not to be corny, as does the ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington"" ending.  Maybe it's because I'm a film buff and fascinated by the heroism of WW2, but I love this movie, can't recommend it enough.

We get to see Truman Burbank in the sequal to the Truman Show.....oh wait, this isn't the Truman Show Part Duex? Sorry for the mistake.In all fairness, the film isn't THAT bad. It's just that it isn't as good as we were all made to believe by the selective raving reviews by the press. In it, we have Peter Appleton(a splendid pre-sixties American name don't ya think?), played solidly by Jim Carrey. He has forgotten his memory and ended up in a town where everyone thinks he's their fabled war hero, a man who hasn't been seen in years.As it turns out, Appleton's new identity brings a new hope to the town, a revitalized attempt to open the old theatre, and one gorgeous blonde hottie. This particular blondie not only possesses a great smile and sense of humor, but also the make-out drive of a pre-sixties(the time period when the film was set) porn star, thus making Petey a very, very happy disillusioned young man.This is where the film needed a huge make-over. It's right before Petey boy dicovers that his ""girl friend"" is a complete hottie. I think the director should have taken a twisted turn here, rather deciding to go with a monsterous mule of a woman as the mystery girl. Wouldn't it be fun to have Peter Appleton discover that his old ""girlfriend"" is actually Betty The Hefty Horse Woman, a woman with three teeth missing, a lazy eye, and enough arm hair to fill a tanker truck? How fun it would have been for Betty to bring Peter home to meet his forgotten offspring at the carnival, Joey the Jugglin Boy and MaGee, the ""Twisted Tater Tot"" girl who gets her thrills form eating peanut butter naked under the pale moon light. But wait, don't stop there, we'd also have to include, for the seriousness of the film, the one-eyed demented sister of Betty, Abbey the Goat Girl, the one they keep locked in the basement for the safety of the townsfolk. Now that, my friends, would have been a great plot line. A film that would no doubt counter its nemesis, Memento, in an epic battle for the most honest movie of the memory loss genre.But, that's not how the direction of the film went. Instead, we get to see Peter Appleton end up in Leave-it-to-Beaver-land USA, practically engaged to a beautiful woman and the son of the sweetest old man since The Shawshank Redemption's Brooks, the book keeper. One can only wonder how the blonde woman has stayed single for so long. Folks, we're talking years here, not months.To top it all off, we get to hear Jim Carrey do a modern rendition of Bill Pullman's Independence Day ""We Will Not Go Quietly In The Night"" speech.

Directed by Frank Darabont ( The Shawshank Redemption ) and starring Jim Carrey, the movie had very high expectations and it did not quite meet those expectations. The movie was dismissed as not much more than sentimental pap with just about as much depth.Those claims have merit, but they are a bit cynical. Not all movies should be expected to be stoic and serious and have great intellectual depth. The Majestic is not supposed to be that. It is the story of a screenwriter who is in a car accident and awakens on a strange beach without any memory of who he was. The townsfolk who discover him believe Carrey to be Luke, a man who was presumed dead in World War II (the film is set in the early 1950's, around the time of the House Un-American Activities Committee). Peter (Carrey) begins to believe that he is, in fact, Luke and tries to rebuild his life in the town, along with rebuilding Luke's father's movie theater, the Majestic. There is not much conflict since the audience knows that Peter is not really Luke and we know that it is only a matter of time until Peter, and the town, find this out.This is a nice movie that shows the development of Peter's character as he learns who he really is and who he wants to be, and is a nice change of pace from the sex and vulgarity that is so much a part of Hollywood movies today.

A lost memory, a lost direction and a lost purpose. As if everyone alive today has a form of amnesia of what it was like to be an ""American"", where trust and a sense of real humanity, of caring individuals in a small town America concerned not with money and ambition but rather a sense of family are reflected in the experiences of Jim Carrey as he re-creates ""Random Harvest"".The only inaccurate historical aspect is the complete lack of ""religion"" in any of the characters and not a church or pastor/priest to be seen anywhere. I believe this was intentional on behalf of the director because he probably realized that any viewer seeing this film about the past in modern times would not believe how religious some people were or how much influence local religious communities had in small towns such as Lawson, California circa 1951.There IS a sense of patriotism and the period was wisely chosen, reflecting the ""Red Scare"" era of insanity just post WW 2.This movie is well done. It will test the patience of a modern audience because like the time period that it covers, things moved a lot slower. There is a plot and character development, which takes time to give for an adequate revelation of facts. It is well written, lacking any sexual inuendo, there is no character cursing up the screen and no explosions and car chases.

He is following in Robin William's footsteps in being a comedia who has the passion and sense to be a serious actor.  I have no quarrel with his abilities.  In fact, all of the extras added to the feel that Lawston, CA was somehow the essence of every Norman Rockwell painting.Moreover, I was impressed with the supporting actors.  David Ogden Stires (Winchester on M*A*S*H), plays the town doctor so well, the actor becomes invisible in his part.  Walter Landay, too, has evolved beyond his ""Space: 1999"" and ""Misssion: Impossible"" days.  He is a late bloomer, but he evokes so many emotions.  He played Luke's father perfectly.  In fact, the congressional inquisitor Elvin Clyde, played by Bob Balaban (Dr. Chandra ""2010"") stokes the emotions of righteous indigation, despite having a minor role.  The details are perfect.Other technical aspects of the film, such as the cinematography, the costuming, and even the old 1940's rumblefish automobiles were spice to the eyes.  It was a well prodcuced film, and the shots of The Majestic theater evoked fond memories of the Oakland Paramount or the old Alameda 3 art deco film palaces that I attended as a lad.  I flet young again as I wastched this film.I think where the film breaks down was in the the sub-plot realing to the communist hearings.  I really did not relate to Jim Carrey's plight.  In fact, it seemed out of place in the over-all story of an amnesiac making a difference in a small town.  I think it would have been better to start the film with the hero waking up on the beach as an amnesiac (which is a classic birth image of water and forgetfulness), and leave it more ambigousous.  Think about the tension as Carrey plays the piano and the ticket-take say ""Yes, I taught him boogie-woogie,"""" and then have the congressional inquisitors come to town!Or another possible ending could have had Appleton REALLY be Luke Trimble.  It would make the film layered and complex, and also be more emotionally satifying.  As the film stands, it seems a mishmash of iron and clay.  If they wanted a feel-good movie, then make it a feel good movie; if you want to make a staement against the communist witch-hunts, then make a statement.  The two cannot be reconciled in the same movie.There are three things to look for.  First, in the black-and-white film ""Sand Pirates of the Saharah,"" if you look closely and quickly, the idol that The Evil But Handsome Prince Khalid holds is the same idol from the beginning sequence of ""Raiders of the Lost Ark.""  Second, the electrical cables in the daytime outside sequence when the turn on the Majestic's lights for the first time are the same one used in ""Back to the Future.""  Third, the town's main strip is the same one used in ""Signs.""  If you hate the movie, at least you can keep your eyes peeled for this.The DVD has one hilarious extra.  They include the entire sequence of the black-and-white film ""Sand Pirates of the Sahar"" that you see in the movie.  I grew up seeing 1940's reruns every Saturday on the UHF, and found this small segemt to ge a great tribute and parody of the old Errol Flynn films.

589870,A2BDJOIXPR2AYU,B00005JKNB,King of Controversy,"[0, 1]","This is a very beautiful and slow movie. The point seems to be comparing the beauty present in the film to the ugliness of our own time. This is some kind of conservative, pro-McCarthy film. I make my outragous claims on here but this time I provide evidence. Googling filmaker Frank Capra it turns out Capra was active in the anti-communist movement (so many people are noting that The Majestic was done in the style of Frank Capra). At one point in the movie Jim Carrey's girlfriend says, ""It's not illegal to be a communists"". This is what those few who support McCarthy often say (I guess to minimize their guilt). If only more of those on the political Left felt (rightly) guilty, the world would not be such an ugly place? I don't doubt the majority of those commenting draw the opposite conclusion, seeing this film as further damnation of the McCarthy era. Do they really feel that way? I suppose some do. Fear is a powerful force if it can alter perception itself.America's critic, Roger Ebert, liked this film. Mr. Ebert seems to support what the film is saying, or he goes along what the director is trying to say, despite it being 'conservative'. He gives this a sort of back handed, facetious, endorsement. He commented on one of the characters, the head communist witch hunter, saying there is a weak, snively character like this in every movie. I guess in the directors previous movie, The Green Mile, it was the rookie guard who was eager to participate in an execution. When the weak, whinny, communist hunter comes on-screen in this movie, I felt sorry for him. Just seeing him - with this movie comparing our time to the past - I suppose - I felt sorry for him. It turns out, he's the one who 'understands the communists' and is opposed to them. Guess he knew what he was talking about.There are a lot of 'speeches' made in this film, something that old movies often had I believe. Some of these are almost anti-speeches however. At one point Jim Carrey's character says, (while they're standing beside a graveyard) ""people who stand up get mowed down"". There's another where Martin Landau says something like, ""sitting at home, watching a small box, that's not entertainment"". This movie makes a statement about community. It didn't fully work for me. This movie takes place in California, where it's warm. Where I'm from it's cold enough you want to stay indoors, and there's not much to do but work inside a factory. Also, for me I think, community is a bunch of people who don't like me. I don't really understand 'community'. Just commenting. . . I think our technology will eventually bring us closer together. If it becomes advanced enough, we can be in our own house yet be right-there with our loved ones, and others, at the same time.In the film, Jim Carrey's character stands up to the government and the anti-communists. Then in an almost amusing turn, he stands up to his Hollywood bosses as well. For the most part, tho, this seemed a very honest movie.While a simple movie, the feelings it explored were very complex. Remembering it, I'm not sure I fully understood it. Not sure I fully understood the ending or the parts near the end (that the film may have been building up to or exposed earlier) - at least I'm having problems putting it into words. It seemed to be saying, as human beings, we're not good enough to live up to our own ideology; whether it be left or right, Marxist, capitalist, or fascist. That even the best intentions and the noblest ideals on the part of us as individuals can lead to negative outcomes. I don't think it was a negative movie, however.

589871,AQ4NJ2T9PVI3L,B00005JKNB,"Kitten With a Whip ""kittenwithawhip""","[6, 19]","NOTE: are you the type that gets all bent out of shape when you read a review of a movie that you loved that completely slams it? I respectfully advise you to quit reading now.Straight up, I rented this movie to see Bruce Campbell. I was hoping this would be an interesting Frank Darabont movie to see in the theater. Then I was warned away from it by TONS of reviewers and friends I trust. I have a friend who idolizes Campbell and will see any movie he's even rumored to have a cameo in in the theater. My friend REFUSED to see this movie (again, bad word-of-mouth, he had a friend that wouldn't touch it with a thousand foot pole). That's how bad it is.So anyway, I read that the DVD special features had footage of Bruce Campbell left on the cutting room floor, so.... I could have just watched the extra footage, but I figured hey, I don't have much planned till tonight, why not watch the whole movie, even though it's 2 and a half hours long? It was directed by Darabont, wasn't it? It couldn't be that bad! Famous last words.The premise is that Jim Carrey (please, Academy, just mail him some sort of honorary Oscar so he goes back to making silly movies again) plays a screenwriter in the 50's during the time of the Hollywood blacklist. You'll never guess what happens next. He ends up on the blacklist! Couldn't see that coming, huh? All he did was go to a meeting to try to impress a girl in college, but too bad--all in the space of one day, he's not going to get his contract renewed at the studio, his girlfriend dumps him off screen, no-one wants to associate with him, etc. He gets hammered at a bar with a cool name like `The Congo Bonga Room', then drives off a bridge (accidentally), hits his head, and winds up with amnesia. Here's where they lost my suspension of disbelief. He's completely hammered, almost drowns, then is washed downstream where he hits his head very hard on a large rock. OK, so he somehow floated, unconscious, but with his head sticking out of the water for about a mile so he didn't drown? Anyway, he wakes up on Plot Device Beach on the coast, with no ID (it got washed away) and no  memory of his former life, even his name. OK, now right there was when I got a bad feeling reading the plot description, but it gets worse. The townspeople think he's Luke someone-or-other, the son who went off to war and never came back, MIA. I'm not going to go into it more than that, because you've probably already fallen asleep simply from reading my plot description.I knew this movie was long, but I swear to God, I would be POSITIVE they were winding it up, and it was the last dramatic scene/event, then there'd be still more. This is how dumb I am: I kept watching in case BC showed up again, even though I KNEW his part was through. That's like deliberately putting your hand back in hot water after you've just burned it, or something.To give you an idea of my high sappiness tolerance,  I cried my eyes off during most of the Green Mile (which many of my friends thought was to sappy, but I went through about 19 kleenex) and in Shawshank--I still get teary when I watch them. .But this movie got so sugary and cliched and warm and fuzzy that I talked back to the screen. This is an interesting testament to how badly this movie failed: a couple months ago I went to a seminar given by a successful writer who said, quite correctly, that the two easiest ways to make a reader/audience cry are goodbye scenes and reunion scenes. The Majestic was overflowing with goodbye/welcome back scenes, but all they made me do was wince and wonder if there was any way this movie could have worked and been entertaining. Jim Carrey has now proved he's a fine dramatic actor, so ENOUGH. We get the picture, Jim. He's miscast (though Carrey doesn't think so, you can tell by watching him) but his performance just seems like he's trying too hard as a result.It's clear that the moviemakers planned (but failed, thank God) to completely sweep the Academy Awards with this one; a ton of scenes might have well as ""For Your Oscar (TM) Consideration"" teletyped along the bottom... but it just didn't work.  The plot line is just something that never should have been greenlighted; it almost seems like a vanity production. Martin Landau, looking worse than he did in Ed Wood as Lugosi (I hope this was intentional) is great , as always; the lead actress was acceptable but forgettable, but it was instead one of the dullest and hardest movies to sit through since...uh....help me out, here....Campbell fans, if you must rent this, rent the DVD. The special features include the entire 5 minute finale of ""Sand Pirates of the Sahara""--which, now that I think of it, seems very out-of-date for the mid fifties, it looks more like a swashbuckling black and white flick of the 40's--a movie that Carrey's character has his first writing credit on. Do NOT sit through the whole movie like dumb me (unless it's just for a moment to see the hilarious poster with him on it). His backstory, which they should have included, was that he plays a over-the-hill matinee idol and corny actor with a serious drinking problem who is hanging onto his career by his fingernails (cough*Errol Flynn*cough) He's looked better, but is hilarious deadpanning lines like ""You thought wrong!""  Diehard Bruce Campbell fans only- rent the movie, watch his part on the special features,saving you the pain I endured of having to sit through the actual movie. Recommended only for hardcore BC fans or people with insomnia or maybe for screenwriters who want to see examples of how NOT to surprise or entertain the audience. Others, RUN!The only positive things I can say about the DVD are that it includes the aforementioned film and also a feature where you can read the history of the Hollywood blacklist, which more people, IMHO, should be educated about. Sorry, Mr. Darabont...there's gotta be another Stephen King-depression era-prison flick you can work on next.",1,The movie that WOULD NOT END!!,1031875200,"09 13, 2002",2002,5965,"['NOTE', 'are',

Holder ""The Review's the Thing""","[5, 7]","What must it have been like to have been in a position of power and responsibility in The United States, when a single person and a cadre of political thugs were able to investigate anyone they pleased in the name of seeking out supposed Communist spies?  By contrast, small town America still lived in relative innocence, believing their government could do no wrong, believing in the values that we have always associated with The United States.  This dichotomy of situations is well-contrasted and exploited in one of Jim Carrey's best movies.Peter Appleton (Jim Carrey) is a Hollywood writer accused of being a member of the Communist party, just as his career seems ready to take off.  Peter goes for a long drive after having too much to drink, at the end of a long day.  His drive ends with his car over an embankment.Peter wakes up to discover that he no longer remembers who he is, and is now in the town of Lawson, California.  The setting is critical to understanding this movie.  Small-town America is as different from large-city America as the moon is compared to the Earth.  Every small town has its claim to fame.  In Lawson's case, it was The Majestic Theater before World War II.  However, the war killed or maimed most of the town's young men, and took the energy of the town with it.  Peter bears a strong resemblance to Lucas Trimble, a town hero, and son of Harry Trimble (Martin Landau), the owner of The Majestic, and soon the town takes Peter for Lucas, convincing Peter in the process.Unfortunately, the Committee on Un-American Activities eventually catches up with Peter just as he remembers who he was.  Peter goes off to face the music with Hal Holbrook as Congressman Doyle.This success of this movie hinges on the ability to understand small towns, and the feeling those towns have for their landmarks and their history.  The loss of the boys during the war was symbolized by the deterioration of The Majestic, which further symbolized the despair and loss of the town of Lawson.  The return of Luke Trimble restored hope, symbolized by the repair of The Majestic.We find that Peter Appleton is all too mercenary, and has few personal values.  However, he finds values in Lawson, and his redemption ultimately becomes redemption for Lawson.  The two are inextricably intertwined.It's easy to criticize this movie for being too larger than life.  Obviously there were exaggerations.  However, the feel of small-town America is correct.  Was the movie predictable, as others have suggested?  I thought that the movie's outcome was one of several.  Ultimately, this movie is family friendly and is a favorite among our small-town family.  Five stars because I liked it after having seen it twice.",5,Good Movie Enhanced by an Accurate Portrayal of a Small Town,1053993600,"05 27, 2003",2003,2725,"['What', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'have', 'been', 'position', 'power', 'responsibility', 'United', 'States', 'when', 'single', 'person', 'cadre', 'political', 'thugs', 'were', 'able', 'investigate', 'anyone', 'pleased', 'name', 'seeking', 'out', 'supposed', 'Communist', 'spies', 'contrast', 'small', 'town', 'America', 'still', 'lived', 'relative', 'innocence', 'believing', 'government', 'could', 'do', 'wrong', 'believing', 'values', 'have', 'always', 'associated', 'United', 'States', 'dichotomy', 'situations', 'well-contrasted', 'exploited', 'one', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'best', 'movies.Peter', 'Appleton', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'Hollywood', 'writer', 'accused', 'being', 'member', 'Communist', 'party', 'just', 'career', 'ready', 'take', 'off', 'Peter', 'long', 'drive', 'having', 'too', 'much', 'drink', 'end', 'long', 'day', 'drive', 'ends', 'car', 'embankment.Peter', 'up', 'discover', 'no', 'longer', 'remembers', 'who', 'now', 'town', 'Lawson', 'California', 'setting', 'critical', 'understanding', 'movie', 'Small-town', 'America', 'different', 'large-city', 'America', 'moon', 'compared', 'Earth', 'Every', 'small', 'town', 'claim', 'fame', 'Lawson', 'case', 'was', 'Majestic', 'Theater', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'However', 'war', 'killed', 'maimed', 'most', 'town', 'young', 'men', 'took', 'energy', 'town', 'Peter', 'strong', 'resemblance', 'Lucas', 'Trimble', 'town', 'hero', 'son', 'Harry', 'Trimble', 'Martin', 'Landau', 'owner', 'Majestic', 'soon', 'town', 'Peter', 'Lucas', 'convincing', 'Peter', 'process.Unfortunately', 'Committee', 'Un-American', 'Activities', 'eventually', 'up', 'Peter', 'just', 'who', 'was', 'Peter', 'face', 'music', 'Hal', 'Holbrook', 'Congressman', 'Doyle.This', 'success', 'movie', 'ability', 'understand', 'small', 'towns', 'feeling', 'towns', 'have', 'landmarks', 'history', 'loss', 'boys', 'war', 'was', 'symbolized', 'deterioration', 'Majestic', 'further', 'symbolized', 'despair', 'loss', 'town', 'Lawson', 'return', 'Luke', 'Trimble', 'restored', 'hope', 'symbolized', 'repair', 'Majestic.We', 'find', 'Peter', 'Appleton', 'too', 'mercenary', 'few', 'personal', 'values', 'However', 'values', 'Lawson', 'redemption', 'ultimately', 'redemption', 'Lawson', 'two', 'are', 'inextricably', 'intertwined.It', 'easy', 'criticize', 'movie', 'being', 'too', 'larger', 'life', 'Obviously', 'were', 'exaggerations', 'However', 'feel', 'small-town', 'America', 'correct', 'Was', 'movie', 'predictable', 'others', 'have', 'suggested', 'thought', 'movie', 'outcome', 'was', 'one', 'several', 'Ultimately', 'movie', 'family', 'friendly', 'favorite', 'small-town', 'family', 'Five', 'stars', 'liked', 'having', 'seen', 'twice']",N/A

Fernandez ""Bookiewookie""","[4, 16]","A good movie is one that captures my attention from the beginning scene, irrespective of my mood, ambience/lighting/noise level of the room, or whether I am multitasking or trying to stay focused.  Nothing, nothing in this movie from the start captured my interest--and I was completely focused on the screen and had an open mind.  The beginning was trite, to say the least.  The movie dragged on and on, and the music was unbearable.  Even the scene of the accident on the bridge was too contrived.  The director was trying hard to draw the viewer's sympathy toward each character long before that was ever any chance for developing this character.  Sappy music prevailed over every scene.  Jim Carrey's character did not have the same  level of intrigue as Truman in ""The Truman Show"" or the other mellow/somber character in ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"".  I don't blame it on Carrey's acting.  It was all because the director lacked creativity or vision in making the character interesting from the beginning.When I decided to give up on the movie (after the father brings Luke home), I fast-forwarded to subsequent chapters.  I found the scenes extremely contrived.  Somehow the director was trying very hard to make this another ""Pleasantville"" (which, by the way, was an outstanding movie).  I thought I was watching the worst of Barry Levinson or Rob Reiner or Penny Marshall!  Clint Eastwood could have pulled this movie off much better!If you are looking for portrayals of a highly sanitized, glossed over, extremely idealistic, and completely UNrealistic 50s life, and if you want a movie that tries hard to touch every sentimental neuron and synapse in your brain, then look no further.

And who gives a rapper's curse that ""Stranger on the Shore"" was written in 1962.  I can always find faults in most films that makes this one less than trivial.  This kind of reviewing is for petty people.No - I will tell you, I am college educated, been around the world and had all my ideals shattered at one time or another.  But this film had my wife and I in tears of joy and sorrow.  This film takes us back to some very needed basics with a classic set up.  It starts off almost as if it was another Carey comedy, but soon turns into something else.  You are too hardened to care that a guy gets stuck on a bridge, in a rain storm?  You don't care that he goes over?  Have you ever met someone who can't recall their past?  It's very sad.  Hey, that black man alone in the film is representative of possibly scores of similar situations that existed back then. (A lot like the black woman my uncle took in and saved from a miserable slow death on the street as a destitute old woman.  He founded a home for homeless recoverng alcholics in the early '60s based on that gesture.  What a cornball he was!)If this film cannot move you, you are likely hopelessly lost in a post modern anarchy of the heart, needing another cinematic action/shock fix to keep you interested in life.  The scene of Carey's character facing up to the devils in the place of civil servants is supreme, even if it is merely an update.  Only a great actor could play that as well as Carey did, right down to the shakey hand and fearfull eyes.  And Jim Carey deserves some recognition as an actor.We happen to know Ferndale, California, where this film was made and visited just as the set was closing.  Mr. Carey left a swath of love and friendship in his wake.  What a supreme guy.  Someday, I hope he gets to shake off his stereotype and gets a part that will win him the recognition he deserves.

What Darabont has done was to capture the spirit of an age that never truly existed on the American scene.

This mixing is not a bad thing either. It takes guts and skill for any director to make two movies in one, and there will always be critics who repudiate any such attempt. But there is no inherent flaw within the attempt. Judging such a movie is no more difficult than judging any movie. Did it combine the disparate parts in such a way as to make the attempt pleasing? This movie stands as a model for future directors to emulate should they decide something similar.Jim Carrey plays Peter Appleton, a successful movie lover and script writer who, in his college days, had the misfortune to join a club to impress a girl, only to find out years later that some communists joined as well. When his membership becomes known, he is blacklisted from working again. At this point, the movie is on target to address the issues that other and similar films as Woody Allen's THE FRONT did. These issues dealt with whether it was morally and legally justifiable to condemn people based only on their alleged membership in organizations that may or may not have included communists. In the real world, the reputations and lives of hundreds of innocent Americans were ripped apart based only the the rabid accusations of the then politically correct witch hunters who saw communists at all levels of American society. THE MAJESTIC could have focused tightly on that but director Darabont placed Carrey in a car accident which robbed him of his memory so that he had to seek a new life in a small town. Darabont's vision of small town American life was taken not from real life but from other movies about small towns. Carrey's adopted town, called Lawson, was full of kind people only too willing to help a stranger. Of course, there is the inevitable romantic complication between a girl and the man that she and the rest of the town assume is the same man who went off to war ten years ago only to die. Carrey returns as that man. I had only a little trouble accepting that the resemblance between Peter Appleton and the dead war hero Luke Trimble was so close as to fool nearly everyone. When Appleton enters town as an amnesiac, the movie changes focus, not the abrupt about turn of suddenly reversing direction on a one way street, but rather that of merely changing lanes on a three lane highway. It is interesting that Carrey plays Appleton-Luke as one who really might be the revived hero. As Luke, Carrey restores not only the dilapidated Majestic theater to its former glory, but also the shattered collective soul of the town that now can welcome back the return of one of its lost sons to the war. Of course, his former identity is revealed by the slimy representatives of the film industry who want to send Appleton's pinko rear end to jail. As Appleton goes on national television while being forced to read a prepared statement implicating himself as a communist, director Darabont borrows from Frank Capra to allow Appleton to clear his good name by quoting from the Bill of Rights. Other critics of this movie find a great deal of fault with such obvious use of other directors' works, but the problem does not lie in the genesis of Appleton's impassioned speech defending the constitution, but rather in assessing its impact on the film, and by implication, on the audience. Do all the various parts to an admittedly many sided movie work? Frankly not all, but most do. I had a more difficult time accepting the abrupt about face of the town in cheering en masse their hero at the end when just before they abandoned him. But perhaps this collective about face is the point of the movie. If Jimmy Stewart or Jim Carrey can argue passionately about the rights of all Americans to speak their minds, then maybe those who did not think so at the beginning of the film, will change their mind at the end.",4,The Majestic: A Movie About Movies,1025913600,"07 6, 2002",2002,4270,"['Not', 'many', 'period', 'movies', 'can', 'successfully', 'capture', 'spirit', 'flavor', 'age', 'Director', 'Frank', 'Darabont', 'done', 'so', 'THE', 'MAJESTIC', 'What', 'Darabont', 'done', 'was', 'capture', 'spirit', 'age', 'never', 'truly', 'existed', 'American', 'scene', 'slice', 'life', 'odd', 'mixing', 'innocence', 'small', 'town', 'life', 'LEAVE', 'IT', 'TO', 'BEAVER', 'more', 'gritty', 'politicizing', 'country', 'torn', 'unfounded', 'accusations', 'House', 'UnAmerican', 'Activities', 'Committee', 'mixing', 'not', 'bad', 'thing', 'guts', 'skill', 'director', 'make', 'two', 'movies', 'one', 'there', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'critics', 'who', 'repudiate', 'such', 'attempt', 'inherent', 'flaw', 'attempt', 'Judging', 'such', 'movie', 'more', 'difficult', 'judging', 'movie', 'Did', 'combine', 'disparate', 'parts', 'way', 'make', 'attempt', 'pleasing', 'movie', 'model', 'future', 'directors', 'emulate', 'should', 'decide', 'something', 'similar.Jim', 'Carrey', 'plays', 'Peter', 'Appleton', 'successful', 'movie', 'lover', 'script', 'writer', 'who', 'college', 'days', 'had', 'misfortune', 'join', 'club', 'impress', 'girl', 'only', 'find', 'out', 'years', 'later', 'communists', 'joined', 'as', 'well', 'When', 'membership', 'known', 'blacklisted', 'working', 'again', 'point', 'movie', 'target', 'address', 'issues', 'other', 'similar', 'films', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'THE', 'FRONT', 'did', 'issues', 'dealt', 'was', 'morally', 'legally', 'justifiable', 'condemn', 'people', 'based', 'only', 'alleged', 'membership', 'organizations', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'included', 'communists', 'real', 'world', 'reputations', 'lives', 'hundreds', 'innocent', 'Americans', 'were', 'ripped', 'apart', 'based', 'only', 'rabid', 'accusations', 'then', 'politically', 'correct', 'witch', 'hunters', 'who', 'saw', 'communists', 'levels', 'American', 'society', 'THE', 'MAJESTIC', 'could', 'have', 'focused', 'tightly', 'director', 'Darabont', 'placed', 'Carrey', 'car', 'accident', 'robbed', 'memory', 'so', 'had', 'seek', 'new', 'life', 'small', 'town', 'Darabont', 'vision', 'small', 'town', 'American', 'life', 'was', 'taken', 'not', 'real', 'life', 'other', 'movies', 'small', 'towns', 'Carrey', 'adopted', 'town', 'called', 'Lawson', 'was', 'full', 'kind', 'people', 'only', 'too', 'willing', 'help', 'stranger', 'course', 'inevitable', 'romantic', 'complication', 'girl', 'man', 'rest', 'town', 'assume', 'same', 'man', 'who', 'went', 'war', 'ten', 'years', 'ago', 'only', 'die', 'Carrey', 'man', 'had', 'only', 'little', 'trouble', 'accepting', 'resemblance', 'Peter', 'Appleton', 'dead', 'war', 'hero', 'Luke', 'Trimble', 'was', 'so', 'close', 'fool', 'nearly', 'everyone', 'When', 'Appleton', 'town', 'amnesiac', 'movie', 'changes', 'focus', 'not', 'abrupt', 'turn', 'suddenly', 'reversing', 'direction', 'one', 'way', 'street', 'rather', 'merely', 'changing', 'lanes', 'three', 'lane', 'highway', 'interesting', 'Carrey', 'Appleton-Luke', 'one', 'who', 'really', 'might', 'be', 'revived', 'hero', 'Luke', 'Carrey', 'not', 'only', 'dilapidated', 'Majestic', 'theater', 'former', 'glory', 'also', 'shattered', 'collective', 'soul', 'town', 'now', 'can', 'welcome', 'back', 'return', 'one', 'lost', 'sons', 'war', 'course', 'former', 'identity', 'revealed', 'slimy', 'representatives', 'film', 'industry', 'who', 'want', 'send', 'Appleton', 'pinko', 'rear', 'end', 'jail', 'Appleton', 'national', 'television', 'being', 'forced', 'read', 'prepared', 'statement', 'implicating', 'communist', 'director', 'Darabont', 'Frank', 'Capra', 'allow', 'Appleton', 'clear', 'good', 'name', 'quoting', 'Bill', 'Rights', 'Other', 'critics', 'movie', 'find', 'great', 'deal', 'fault', 'such', 'obvious', 'use', 'other', 'directors', 'works', 'problem', 'not', 'lie', 'genesis', 'Appleton', 'impassioned', 'speech', 'defending', 'constitution', 'rather', 'assessing', 'impact', 'film', 'implication', 'audience', 'Do', 'various', 'parts', 'admittedly', 'many', 'sided', 'movie', 'work', 'Frankly', 'not', 'all', 'most', 'do', 'had', 'more', 'difficult', 'time', 'accepting', 'abrupt', 'face', 'town', 'cheering', 'en', 'masse', 'hero', 'end', 'when', 'just', 'abandoned', 'perhaps', 'collective', 'face', 'point', 'movie', 'Jimmy', 'Stewart', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'can', 'argue', 'passionately', 'rights', 'Americans', 'speak', 'minds', 'then', 'maybe', 'who', 'did', 'not', 'think', 'so', 'beginning', 'film', 'will', 'change', 'mind', 'end']",N/A
589884,A152C8GYY25HAH,B00005JKNB,Matthew Horner,"[6, 8]","When I was as a kid, one of my favorite movies was an epic Western called ""Little Big Man"". In one scene, an old Indian chief tells Dustin Hoffman's character that it's a good day to die. They go up to the sacred mountain, and the chief lays down to die. After a few hours, it's obvious that he isn't going to pass on, so he gets up. Dustin asks him why he didn't die, and the chief shrugs his shoulders and replies, ""Sometimes the magic works, and sometimes it doesn't."" I have always remembered that line and applied it to many situations in life.Movie magic doesn't work in ""The Majestic"". Though it's well intentioned and aims to be uplifting, I found it laborious to sit through it. It isn't just that it's long, although some judicious editing might have helped. It's that the story, the style and the feel are totally bogus. It looks back longingly at an America that never existed. The movie recalls the 1940s Hollywood version of the small town life, not the real thing. The result is an oddity, sort of a fiction based on a fiction.Peter Appleton [Jim Carrey] is an up and coming screenwriter in post-W.W.II Hollywood. Senator Joe McCarthy's infamous House Committee on Un-American Activities is in the midst of a witch hunt in Hollywood, looking for Communist conspirators. [This much of the movie is true.] Peter, who attended a few Communist party meeting in college because he was chasing some girl, is caught up in all this. Thinking his career is now ruined, he gets very drunk one night. He decides to go for a drive and winds up crashing his car into a river near a small California town. He is saved but has amnesia. The town lost a large number of sons to the war, and Peter looks so much like one of them that even the missing man's father thinks he is his son miraculously returned. Peter suspects he isn't the guy, but, since he has no memory, plays along. He helps the man reopen his old movie theater and generally helps the town's citizens rediscovery joy and hope. Meanwhile, the Feds are looking for Peter to make him testify before the Committee.I do like Jim Carrey, whose performance is excellent. If his fans can not accept him in a serious role, that does nothing to lessen the fact that he is a fine dramatic actor as well as a great comedian. His turn in ""The Truman Show"" was one of the acting highlights of 1999.The movie has been compared to the works of Frank Capra and Preston Sturges, two great directors from the 1930s and 1940s. I suggest that those making the comparisons go back and watch some of these old movies again. Capra often used a sentimental approach, but this was back in the days when addressing social injustices was a trickier matter than it is today. His movies were born of a sweet naivete. ""The Majestic"" seems simply manipulative. Sturges had an acerbic wit. His characters were smart and quick-witted. He made his best social commentaries through laughter. ""The Majestic"" is none of these things.Ironically, the movies that post-WWII Hollywood is most famous for are not the happy, warm ones, but the ones that were gritty, realistic and/or full of dark overtones. Post 9/11, it's proving to be much the same.

It is an excellent movie, and one well worth the price of admission to the Majestic.As I watched this film, I was struck with nostalgia. Those years following World War II were a more innocent time. They were a time when certain values, lost to us now, were in full flower. Romantic and touching, the film centers on Peter Appleton who has turned up on the beach of a small town after an accident has left him with amnesia. He is mistaken for Luke Trimble, a local hero and the son of a local man named Harry, beautifully played by Martin Landau. He meets a beautiful gal, and they embark upon an effort to rebuild the Majestic theatre. However, the McCarthy era is in full swing, and all the power of the federal government is arrayed against him.No, you will not find much violence, foul language, or scandals boiling beneath the surface. This is just a simple, pure, unsullied entertainment. I believe this is the finest effort by Jim Carrey to date. He plays it straight, and though it has humor, it is the humor of a typical human being caught in the middle of a time when blacklisting was in vogue, defending himself from unfounded charges amid one of history's most virulent witch hunts.My opinion is that this is a wonderful movie.

Once again, he plays a straight-faced character (The Truman Show and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind) and leaves the comic shtick aside for this 2001 sleeper.  Carrey plays Peter Appleton a Hollywood screenwriter who happens to be blacklisted during the 1950s Communist Scare McCarthy-era and who's life takes an enormous turn while making an evening drive, he attempts to avoid running over a possum.  It is after that event that the film emerges into something out of a Frank Capra film a la ""It's a Wonderful Life"" with its subtle tint of patriotism and mega dose of nostalgia.With that element in mind, there are interesting aspects within the storyline that highlight the film.  Carrey's character loses his memory and the people of the small town of Lawson takes him in as their own, especially Martin Landau's character, Harry Trimble, who thinks as well as the rest of the townspeople that Peter is his son Luke, the hometown boy who has been missing for nine years possibly during the War in the Pacific.  Also, Adele Stanton played by Laurie Stanton, the girl he left behind has still left the light on for Luke, so to speak, which adds a bit of romance within the movie.  But most importantly, the human condition that has been displayed in most Capra films.Overall, ""The Majestic"" was an enlightening film to watch despite it running a little over two hours.

The Majestic is about a man named Peter, played by Jim Carey, who gets into an accident and gets amnesia.  A man, played by James Whitmore (Brooks from Shawshank), finds Peter on the beach.  He then takes him to town, where Peter is identified as Luke.  Luke is a man who could do no wrong.  The towns rememberance of Luke is that of a God, and Peter/Luke must try to get his memory back, while the town believes he's Luke, Peter is not so sure.Although this story is a little far fetched, basically all of Darabont's movies are, it is a wonderful story that at times becomes a bit predictable.  It doesn't have the &quot;BANG&quot; of an ending like Shawshank, but still contains a story that is definitely worth watching.The acting is superb, Carey is outstanding, along with a very strong support from everyone is the movie.

589899,A1J2931UBBJPXM,B00005JKNB,Reviewer,"[0, 0]","In the early `50s, a trip from Los Angeles to Bakersfield would take about eight hours; then they built the Interstate, and now you can make the same trip in two hours.  The experience of the journey is basically the same, as you're covering the same ground, only quicker.  The main difference is that once you reach your destination now, you can actually appreciate it more because you're not so worn out from the trip itself.  Interestingly enough, ""The Majestic,"" directed by Frank Darabont, is set in the early `50s, and uses the pre-Interstate route to take you to the final destination.  The thing is, had Darabont opted for the two hour route (which was available), he would have taken his audience to the same place and it would have been entirely more effective.  Especially since, once you finally arrive, you realize that you've been there before, anyway.  Even so, like visiting an historic landmark, it's worth a look.  But be prepared; the journey is long, and it may wear you down a bit.Peter Appleton (Jim Carrey) is a ""B"" movie Hollywood screenwriter, but he's working on a project now that just may take him to the ""A"" list.  This is his big chance, and he's going to make the most of it; this is the one that's going to take him to the top.  Right in the middle of it, however, there's a glitch-- and it's a big one:  The McCarthy hearings are in full swing, Peter's name has been given to the committee, and he's been called to testify.  And his movie-- along with his future-- has been put on hold.Shocked and dismayed at having the rug pulled out from under him, Peter gets in his car that night and hits the highway, driving just to drive, to get away, letting the road take him where it may until the sun comes up or he runs out of gas, whichever comes first.  Neither of which happens, though, as fate intervenes; he has an accident, and when he comes to he's lying on a beach somewhere, with no idea who he is or why he's there.  But there's still some luck left in the hand he's holding, and his name is Stan Keller (James Whitmore), who is out for his morning stroll when he finds Peter, befriends him and takes him into town.  And it's there that Peter's life really begins to change, when a man named Harry Trimble (Martin Landau) spots him and mistakes him for his son, Luke-- gone some nine years and thought lost at war.  For Harry-- and for the whole town-- it's like a miracle; as if they've all been given a second chance.  Because Luke-- thought gone forever-- has come back.Darabont has crafted and delivered a film that initially (for the first forty-five minutes or so) is alive in a Bradburyesque way that is filled with hope and the stuff that dreams are made of.  It's the story of a man wronged who not only gets a second chance, but a chance at something seemingly better than what he had before.  Something cleaner, somehow; pure.  But once Darabont has established the magic, he enters a holding pattern.  Peter may not know who he is, but we do, and we know it's only a matter of time before his true identity is revealed.  In the meantime, the magic slowly begins to dissipate in the realization that Peter's story is really nothing more than a smoke-and-mirrors act, behind which lies the true purpose of Darabont's film.  What we begin to understand is that the Peter Appleton character is nothing more than a vehicle through which a statement can be made about McCarthyism and the injustice it wrought upon the lives of a number of innocent people.""The Majestic"" then, is a cinematic hybrid; the offspring of a union between ""Something Wicked This Way Comes"" and ""Guilty by Suspicion.""  An interesting concept, to be sure, and fairly well executed by Darabont.  But you leave home for a specific destination, only to find you're elsewhere once you arrive.  And Darabont takes you there via the scenic route; better had he taken the alternate route, as there is nothing along his route that makes the beginning or the end any more significant, entertaining or noteworthy in any way.The saving grace of the project is Jim Carry, who leaves his rubber face behind this time and gives a performance that is truly ""majestic.""  The most significant aspect of this film, in fact, is that it demonstrates what a gifted, talented actor Carrey is.  His portrayal of Peter Appleton is quite natural and unaffected, he exhibits an unusual (for him) amount of restraint while using an introspective approach to the character, and there is a decided lack of pretentiousness in his presentation that makes him entirely real and convincing.  It's a performance that should prove to his detractors, once and for all, that there is more to Jim Carrey than ""Ace Ventura"" or ""Lloyd Christmas.""As the man who gets the ball rolling by mistaking Peter for his own son, Martin Landau gives an affecting performance, although he could've taken a cue from Carrey in the restraint department, as he tends a bit too much toward melodrama at times.  Still, it's an engaging portrayal and does, indeed, effect the desired results.The supporting cast includes Laurie Holden (Adele), Allen Garfield (Leo), Amanda Detmer (Sandra), Bob Balaban (Elvin Clyde), Brent Briscoe (Sheriff Coleman), Jeffrey DeMunn (Ernie), Hal Holbrook (Congressman Doyle), Ron Rifkin (Kevin), David Ogden Stiers (Doc Stanton) and Karl Bury (Bob).  ""The Majestic"" then, is something of a mixed bag; it's an engaging film, but Darabont allows the emotional involvement to waver somewhat during the journey, before successfully reestablishing it at the end.  And the outer shell masks the fact that there's also a nut inside, along with the milk chocolate.  In the final analysis, however, it's still the magic that is the movies.",3,A &quot;Majestic&quot; Performance by Jim Carrey,1024617600,"06 21, 2002",2002,5722,"['early', '50s', 'trip', 'Los',

When he takes a drive up the coast, has an accident and loses his memory he is embraced by a small town as its long lost war hero. He inherits a beautiful fiance and a loving father.Complications ensue when his memory and true identity return about the time he is found, fingered and branded by the House Un-American Activities Committee as a commie on the lam.  Carrey is terrific as the archetypal, 1950s movie-loving American who is drifting along with undeserved good fortune but is forced to either discover his true, moral self or take the easy way out.  Martin Landau is touching as the man who thinks Carrey is his son.  And Sandra Sinclair is just right as the wanting to believe but not quite convinced girlfriend.This beautiful, involving and surprisingly intimate movie is much better on the home screen than in the theater. Unfortunately, this supremely well-crafted production so strongly evokes ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington,"" ""It's a Wonderful Life"" and ""Sullivan's Travels"" that there is a palpable patina of deja vu that greatly detracts from what should be total absorption in this otherwise heartwarming tale.

The film revolves around a b-movie writer played by Jim Carrey who is blacklisted. However, on a drunken binge, he has an accident and washes ashore with amnesia in a small town mourning the loss of their young boys from World War II. They mistake Carrey as Luke, one of the most beloved, and adopt him.This sort of kitschy, heartwarming story is good, but loses some of its effect because of the cheesy, inspirational music, warm family moment, and exaggerated political morals.The film is framed by Carrey looking off into space listening to the Hollywood moguls change his film to be more glamorous. The scenes serve as competent bookends that play very effectively and display the changes in the character.There is a scene with gorgeous yet obviously fake sunset background. It looks like a beautiful painting.Historically, the film is somewhat flawed in several ways. Almost every movie that attempts to create a film, a Hollywood name, or anything involving old Hollywood fails miserably. The B-movie Sand Pirates of the Sahara is no exception. The acting is fake and exaggerated and lends itself to the misconception that classic films are overly stagy and elaborate. However, the music is accurate. The McCarthy Trials themselves are somewhat misrepresented. Those involved were incredibly vicious to those being questioned, especially if they did not cooperate in the implicated way, and this movie depicts the leaders as being lenient. Not so at all. Many careers were completely ruined because of suspected communist sympathies.This film displays tinges of a genuine love for old films and the theaters that housed them. The old man who runs the theater openly argues his distaste for television. The impact that films have, even small parts of films, is utilized. This film also effectively uses a clip from The Big Parade, a famous silent film about war. This clip shows that even films without sound have relevance in times in which most films do have it.The great thing about this movie is that it captures the atmosphere and attitudes of the time period, or at least the ideal of the time. The people in the town are friendly and willing to help each other. There is even one man who is more suspicious and unlike the others, but his character is common in classic films. The story itself is even old fashioned and one could picture Joel McCrea or Jimmy Stewart in the role that Carrey plays. The drawback is that even though the set-up is right for emulating a classic film, it is much too long. The scenes are long and drawn out instead of brief but poignant. They lose some of their strength this way. The scenes could have been more effective if they were cut off sooner because one always seems to be able to predict what will happen next since the scenario is not too strange or original.Jim Carrey does a great job at playing various emotions; perhaps the film did not do well upon release because audiences were so unaccustomed to thinking of Carrey as a dramatic star. He is and proves that he is a great actor. Laurie Holdon holds her own and has very cute scenes; she even hiccups believably.Overall, this film is good, although it could have been better.",4,Carrey in a Straight Part,1128470400,"10 5, 2005",2005,3265,"['Majestic', 'place', 'McCarthy', 'Trials', 'witch', 'hunts', '1950s', 'film', 'around', 'b-movie', 'writer', 'played', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'who', 'blacklisted', 'However', 'drunken', 'binge', 'accident', 'washes', 'ashore', 'amnesia', 'small', 'town', 'mourning', 'loss', 'young', 'boys', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'mistake', 'Carrey', 'Luke', 'one', 'most', 'beloved', 'adopt', 'him.This', 'sort', 'kitschy', 'heartwarming', 'story', 'good', 'effect', 'cheesy', 'inspirational', 'music', 'warm', 'family', 'moment', 'exaggerated', 'political', 'morals.The', 'film', 'framed', 'Carrey', 'looking', 'off', 'space', 'listening', 'Hollywood', 'moguls', 'change', 'film', 'be', 'more', 'glamorous', 'scenes', 'serve', 'competent', 'play', 'very', 'effectively', 'display', 'changes', 'character.There', 'scene', 'gorgeous', 'yet', 'obviously', 'fake', 'sunset', 'background', 'beautiful', 'painting.Historically', 'film', 'somewhat', 'flawed', 'several', 'ways', 'movie', 'create', 'film', 'Hollywood', 'name', 'anything', 'involving', 'old', 'Hollywood', 'miserably', 'B-movie', 'Sand', 'Pirates', 'Sahara', 'exception', 'acting', 'fake', 'exaggerated', 'misconception', 'classic', 'films', 'are', 'overly', 'stagy', 'elaborate', 'However', 'music', 'accurate', 'McCarthy', 'Trials', 'are', 'somewhat', 'misrepresented', 'involved', 'were', 'incredibly', 'vicious', 'being', 'questioned', 'especially', 'did', 'not', 'cooperate', 'implicated', 'way', 'movie', 'leaders', 'being', 'lenient', 'Not', 'so', 'Many', 'careers', 'were', 'completely', 'ruined', 'suspected', 'communist', 'sympathies.This', 'film', 'displays', 'tinges', 'genuine', 'love', 'old', 'films', 'theaters', 'housed', 'old', 'man', 'who', 'theater', 'openly', 'distaste', 'television', 'impact', 'films', 'have', 'even', 'small', 'parts', 'films', 'utilized', 'film', 'also', 'effectively', 'clip', 'Big', 'Parade', 'famous', 'silent', 'film', 'war', 'clip', 'even', 'films', 'sound', 'have', 'relevance', 'times', 'most', 'films', 'do', 'have', 'it.The', 'great', 'thing', 'movie', 'atmosphere', 'attitudes', 'time', 'period', 'least', 'ideal', 'time', 'people', 'town', 'are', 'friendly', 'willing', 'help', 'other', 'even', 'one', 'man', 'who', 'more', 'suspicious', 'others', 'character', 'common', 'classic', 'films', 'story', 'even', 'old', 'fashioned', 'one', 'could', 'picture', 'Joel', 'McCrea', 'Jimmy', 'Stewart', 'role', 'Carrey', 'drawback', 'even', 'set-up', 'right', 'emulating', 'classic', 'film', 'much', 'too', 'long', 'scenes', 'are', 'long', 'drawn', 'out', 'instead', 'brief', 'poignant', 'lose', 'strength', 'way', 'scenes', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'effective', 'were', 'cut', 'off', 'sooner', 'one', 'always', 'be', 'able', 'predict', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'next', 'scenario', 'not', 'too', 'strange', 'original.Jim', 'Carrey', 'great', 'job', 'playing', 'various', 'emotions', 'perhaps', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'do', 'well', 'release', 'audiences', 'were', 'so', 'unaccustomed', 'thinking', 'Carrey', 'dramatic', 'star', 'great', 'actor', 'Laurie', 'Holdon', 'own', 'very', 'cute', 'scenes', 'even', 'hiccups', 'believably.Overall', 'film', 'good', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better']",N/A

Another misfortune that precluded critical acclaim for this movie is that few people are willing to see beyond Jim Carrey's astonishing talent for crude physical comedy, at which he is an unparalleled genius.  But he is also one of the best dramatic actors film makers have ever had the good luck to discover, and his performance by itself would make this one of the best movies hollywood has ever created, and yet there's more.  Each person in this movie is giving what is probably the best performance of their own career, and the movie itself is without doubt one of the best written and best filmed movies ever made.",5,Film historians of the late twenty-first century will wonder how so many people could have overlooked this movie.,1288828800,"11 4, 2010",2010,1046,"[""'m"", 'sure', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'well-received', 'had', 'been', 'released', 'six', 'months', 'earlier', 'was', 'three', 'months', 'destruction', 'World', 'Trade', 'Center', 'America', 'was', 'mood', 'consider', 'justness', 'war', 'question', 'infallibility', 'Government', 'course', 'events', 'years', 'following', 'release', 'have', 'shown', 'Majestic', 'be', 'far', 'more', 'timely', 'anyone', 'could', 'have', 'guessed', 'misfortune', 'precluded', 'critical', 'acclaim', 'movie', 'few', 'people', 'are', 'willing', 'see', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'astonishing', 'talent', 'crude', 'physical', 'comedy', 'unparalleled', 'genius', 'also', 'one', 'best', 'dramatic', 'actors', 'film', 'makers', 'have', 'ever', 'had', 'good', 'luck', 'discover', 'performance', 'would', 'make', 'one', 'best', 'movies', 'hollywood', 'ever', 'created', 'yet', 'more', 'person', 'movie', 'giving', 'what', 'probably', 'best', 'performance', 'own', 'career', 'movie', 'doubt', 'one', 'best', 'written', 'best', 'filmed', 'movies', 'ever', 'made']",N/A

But if you are a Jim Carrey fan, you may love this movie, but the movie runs about 2 and a half hours. And I feel that this is one of the movies, books, music, etc that doesn't dervse 5 stars but 4 stars. But if you like to watch movies about 2 hours and 30 mintues, I also reccomend Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. As the movie opens, Peter Appleton (Jim Carrey) is a movie writer. Until he gets into a car crash, and doesn't remember anything when he wakes up. He goes to a town, and is mistaken for Luke Trimble, who has been missing for a long time. Of course if mistaken is the right word. Matt Damon (in an uncredited role) voices Luke Trimble only once in this movie. There are two things I feel that are important to know before you wach a movie (for the first time). One is to know how long the movie runs. And two, know what the movie is rated. This movie got a PG rating. So I will leave it up to you if you want to let your kids/teenagers watching this.

Just as in ""The Green Mile"", Darabont gives us way too much time to think about what might happen, and given it's such an old-fashioned story you can easily work it out.  Of course, movies aren't always about twists and surprises, but when you find yourself predicting it shot for shot and anticipating dialogue line for line by the end of the first half hour, there's something seriously amiss.  It isn't helped by Mark Isham's insistently saccharine score washing over every scene, relentlessly reminding you that every second moment is meant to be ""achingly emotional.""  It's almost as if they don't trust the actors or the script.  Ironically, the musical safety net just forces us out: we're never allowed to fall into the story, to forget for a moment that it's a movie we're watching and feel things out for ourselves.  Quite simply, it never gets real.  The result is film which feels artificial, an academically interesting, intertextual, introspective Capra homage at best.  And as much as we love Capra, there's a reason they stopped making films like his: cinema has moved on.  It doesn't mean audiences are any more or less sophisticated these days.  It just means they have been taught to have different expectations.  And while filmmakers shouldn't pander to those, they ignore them at their peril.  It's a shame this film isn't better, because there's a really good story here - an important story about patriotism, freedom, American democracy, and the kind of state-sanctioned lunacy inflicted in their name.  But as presented, ""The Majestic"" makes them seem like antiquated heirlooms of a fondly remembered age - notions we can take out, dust off, briefly smile at, then just as quickly forget.",3,Sabotaged by its own style,1041465600,"01 2, 2003",2003,1904,"['surprisingly', 'good', 'performance', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'heart-warming', 'story', 'Michael', 'Sloane', 'beautiful', 'direction', 'Frank', 'Darabont', 'are', 'undermined', 'here', 'fatally', 'languorous', 'pacing', 'Just', 'Green', 'Mile', 'Darabont', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'think', 'what', 'might', 'happen', 'given', 'such', 'old-fashioned', 'story', 'can', 'easily', 'work', 'out', 'course', 'movies', 'are', ""n't"", 'always', 'twists', 'surprises', 'when', 'find', 'predicting', 'shot', 'shot', 'anticipating', 'dialogue', 'line', 'line', 'end', 'first', 'half', 'hour', 'something', 'seriously', 'amiss', ""n't"", 'helped', 'Mark', 'Isham', 'insistently', 'saccharine', 'score', 'washing', 'scene', 'relentlessly', 'reminding', 'second', 'moment', 'meant', 'be', 'achingly', 'emotional', 'almost', 'do', ""n't"", 'trust', 'actors', 'script', 'Ironically', 'musical', 'safety', 'net', 'just', 'forces', ""'re"", 'never', 'allowed', 'fall', 'story', 'forget', 'moment', 'movie', ""'re"", 'watching', 'feel', 'things', 'out', 'ourselves', 'Quite', 'simply', 'never', 'real', 'result', 'film', 'artificial', 'academically', 'interesting', 'intertextual', 'introspective', 'Capra', 'homage', 'best', 'as', 'much', 'love', 'Capra', 'reason', 'stopped', 'making', 'films', 'cinema', 'moved', ""n't"", 'mean', 'audiences', 'are', 'more', 'less', 'sophisticated', 'days', 'just', 'have', 'been', 'taught', 'have', 'different', 'expectations', 'filmmakers', 'should', ""n't"", 'pander', 'ignore', 'peril', 'shame', 'film', ""n't"", 'better', 'really', 'good', 'story', 'here', 'important', 'story', 'patriotism', 'freedom', 'American', 'democracy', 'kind', 'state-sanctioned', 'lunacy', 'inflicted', 'name', 'presented', 'Majestic', 'seem', 'antiquated', 'heirlooms', 'fondly', 'remembered', 'age', 'notions', 'can', 'take', 'out', 'dust', 'off', 'briefly', 'smile', 'then', 'just', 'quickly', 'forget']",N/A

In each beautifully acted scene, you are waiting for the Lerner and Lowe music to appear, but you still love the film.  Well, in this movie you are waiting for the comedy to appear, a la Hail the Conquering Hero and it doesn't appear.  So now you are stuck with a fantasy/drama about the blacklist.  But there's already a good documentary &quot;Hollywood and the Blacklist&quot; and there's &quot;The Front,&quot; with Woody Allen and Zero Mostel.  Then you are hoping that Frank Darabont's follow-up to the superb Shawshank Redemption and the watchable if over-symbolic Green Mile will be a humdinger.  The movie theater is beautiful, the subject still draws us in, but Jim Carrey's final speech is inspiring but too late.  Instead you purchase the following adjectives from the movie mistake candy counter:Snail-paced: the greatness of Jim Carrey is his unpredictably mad but sharp timing.  The great movies of the 40's and 50's relied on timing.  Are you telling me that most audiences from that era would have stayed around for this potboiler?  I'll take a Howard Hawks screwball comedy any day.Corny-As my father, a movie lover since the 20's, and another reviewer have exclaimed.  Here's three examples.  First, you know you are in trouble when you have Jim Carrey, drunk, spill his life to a stuffed smiling monkey.  And it's our misfortune that the monkey artistically reappears at the end of the movie.  (You know, &quot;Monkeybone&quot; is not that bad a movie.  Brendan Fraser is funny and has a great goofy smile and the monkey talks back and torments, as a monkey should.)  Second, based upon the theater renovation montage, I was expecting Judy Garland and Mickey Rooney to show up and give their all.  And, third, what book does the lawyer girlfriend leave for Carrey before he meets with the HUAC?  My wife predicted Plato's Republic.  Hah-I won-it was the Constitution!  Thank goodness it wasn't The Prophet.Scene-chewing: Martin Landau is a master, but you shouldn't resort to ravenous comsumption when the dialogue doesn't inspire.  No, Mr. Darabont, tell Martin to pull it in, we get it!  He looks daffy instead of dignified.Implausible: Are you telling me a father couldn't tell his son from an imposter.  C'mon, any good enough parent lovingly knows the contours and quirks of his or her child's body.  And as my wife pointed out, where are all the smokers in this little town?  In normal life, more citizens than not had a ciggy dangling from the lips.  And don't tell me that this is just a fantasy of a small town and life in the 40's and early '50's.  Note the flashback scene of WWII soldiers writing playing cards and writing home to their honeys.  Almost EVERYONE is smoking in that short scene, unfiltered!  The movie structure unsuccessfully swings both ways trying to be fantasy and real life.Stiff: When Carrey's character leaves the sody-shop with his supposed long-lost love, the whole town follows the two of them down the street.  That's the director pushing the blocking to create &quot;charm.&quot;Trite: The movie collapses under the weight of it's script when it descends in a &quot;movie of the week&quot; scene: the elderly black man, who opens up the theater on time is given a watch(why is there only man of color in the town, and how could he stand it?).  It's the glances and sentiment that are makes one squirm.Why do Frank Capra's films shine when this this one doesn't.  A sense of humor, enough believability to overcome sentiment and corniness, great writing that complements great acting and not the opposite.  These are intangibles.

It tries too hard to invoke the images of Jimmy Stewart in his prime... it makes one wonder if the scene in this movie where the studio execs are talking about bastardizing an existing movie script, by adding hackneed sentimentality in order to pull at the heart strings of the audience was something secretly taped when the producers initially pitched ""The Majestic"" to the studio brass.This movie is, in many ways, a throwback to those old black and white movies that your parents, or grandparents liked.

589922,APRZ2IVM8JTLV,B00005JKNB,The Mysterious Traveler,"[4, 19]","THE MAJESTIC(2001) Produced and Directed by Comrade Frank Darabont.Starring Jim Carrey, Bob Balaban, Laurie Holden, Martin Landau, Hal Holbrook, Ron Rifkin, David Ogden Stiers, James Whitmore, Gary Marshall, Paul Mazursky, Carl Reiner, Rob Reiner, Sydney Pollack, Matt Damon and Bruce Campbell.It is 1954 and ""apolitical"" scriptwriter Carrey is about to be supoenaed before HUAC because, in 1946, he went to a meeting of a Communist Front group because he wanted to bed an attractive girl there. Intent on cooperating to save his career, Carrey first gets into an auto accident that robs him of his memory and washes him up on the beach of the town of Lawson(named after the Commisar of Hollywood John Howard Lawson) where he is mistaken for a long lost World War Two hero. While sexually repressed posssibly homosexual Nazi like members of HUAC search for him, Carrey reopens a defunct movie theater, romances the dead hero's girlfriend and, upon recovering his memory and finally getting the supoena--in a ludicrous scene--HUAC arrives in a phalanx of cars and motoycycles lacking only armor and air support--is given the choice of testifying as a friendly witness and getting his career back or getting to bed the hottie back at Larson.The film---TWO HOURS AND 32 MINUTES LONG--is basically another retread of CRADLE WILL ROCK and effectively over at the thirteen minutes running time. Endlessly didactic, the film, besides the repetitive commie prop, is utterly dishonest and fake on every possible level there is to be dishonest and fake at. The film is a historical crime. Though set in 1954, the characters go on and on about World War Two and yet the Korean War apparently never happened. The film all but says that the Rosenbergs were innocent. To make its fraudulent historical points, the film shows a newsreel yet it is a newsreel specifically created for the film since to do otherwise might let some truth creep in. The newsreel refers to the Hollywood Ten as being ""writers"" which would have surprised the comrades who were producers and directors among them but the film wants us to think that Anti-communists are ""anti-intellectual"".The film is incredibly snobbish and hateful towards Golden Age Hollywood especially the B picture YET to ""prove"" that Golden Age films were dross---except for the Commie prop ones---they have to create a fake B film featuring Bruce Campbell that is so lame and hamfisted that it would not have passed muster at Monogram. What? They could not have shown a clip from a Jeff Chandler or Tony Curtis picture? Or would actually showing a real film from that period ruin things?? The fake film is also in Black and White(EVIL Black and White!!!) when the type of adventure B films being made at that period where ALL in color. The townspeople at Larson are those fake cutsey tootsie types that modern filmmakers think are aping Frank Capra but are actually merely Red pod people with no lives of their own, no sense of reality and certainly utterly unconvincing as people living in 1954.The film goes on and on about the Constitution yet the people making the film do not give a damn about the Constitution. The film goes on and on about the soldiers who fought in World War Two yet the same people making this film think American soldiers are drooling subhuman Nazi rapists and baby killers.As all of these films are, it is ultimately about hate. Hatred for the viewer. Hatred for the country. Hatred for its history. Hatred for the American film before 1970. Hatred of all that does not think like them and obey them at all times. And finally hate for the sake of hate.The film tanked at the box office but not to worry. Hollywood will keeping making them until you think the way they want you to. You WILL learn to love Big Brother.A truly loathsome film in every respect.

Unfortunately I believe that he waited too long in his career to take on a non comedic role such as this one.  I personally liked the movie and the performance by Carrey.

589928,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00005JKNB,Tsuyoshi,"[1, 5]","Frank Darabont loves old Hollywood films, and that's apparent from his works.  In &quot;Shawshank Redemption&quot; we saw Rita Hayworth film &quot;Gilda&quot; and in &quot;The Green Miles&quot; musical classic &quot;Top Hat.&quot;  As if he wants to say Hollywood is no longer what it should be, he again took Jimmy Stewart material in &quot;The Majestic&quot; in which Jim Carrey plays a role of Peter, a screenwriter in the McCarthy period, with a lot of references to old Hollywood movies again.Peter is tired of his hackeyed work (as described in  Fitzgerald's funny &quot;Pat Hobby&quot; stories), and of stupid ideas of studio bosses.  But he is suddenly given another life when he meets an car accident, loses his memories, and gets stranded on the shore of a small town.  And the people of the town recognize him as Luke, a war hero supposed to be dead, but now coming back there as a symbol of hope.  He starts a new life as Luke, falls in love with a girl, and finally re-opens a theater &quot;The Majestic.&quot;  Everything is all right until he, as well as FBI, remember his lost identity, which is in fact blacklisted on UnAmerican Activity Subcommittee.The rest of the story should not be told, but it is not a hard task for anyone to imagine that.  And that moment surely has power, sincerity, and good performance from Carrey playing Peter wavering between two ways of life to choose, but the problem is that it takes too long time to reach there.  As is often the case with Darabont's films, the film spends nearly 1 hour in the opening part to set up its situation.  Though helped by Carrey in a serious vein, and Martin Landau as his &quot;father,&quot; the film is sometime undeniably self-indulgent.  (Actually, I slept for a while.  Sorry, but it's true.)But to me, more fundamental problem is that we have much superior film that realizes the value &quot;The Majestic&quot; champions, that is, &quot;The Front&quot; starring Woody Allen (but directed by Martin Ritt).  Just take a look at that, and you know what I mean.  And though I admit the film &quot;The Majestic&quot; goes rather  like a fable than a realistic story, its meaning is too obvious, its way of expressing it too far-fetched.  It is a worthy attempt for Hollywood to look back this dark age, but you don't have to use this roundabout fashion, which includes incredible co-incidences (such as one character experiences two key incidents of life at the same time; or, small townspeople all believing Peter as Luke when he is about to summoned to the committee, etc.)Finally, what I disagree with the film most is its very easy, or naive conclusion about the proceedings at the Committee.  What happened to Chaplin, who had to live in Europe after leaving America?  Or what did scriptwriter Dalton Trumbo do when he was blacklisted (he used a &quot;front&quot; in his work, &quot;Roman Holiday&quot;)?  If you know these historical things, you never appreciate the finale as Darabont wanted you to.  I don't deny his good-intention and value of film's allegorical meanings, but the film is too long, too thin, and most of all, misguiding in thinking about this important age in the history of modern America.",2,"For All Its Intention, Too Long, And Too Good to Be True",1027900800,"07 29, 2002",2002,3198,"['Frank', 'Darabont', 'old', 'Hollywood', 'films', 'apparent', 'works', 'quot', 'Shawshank', 'Redemption', 'quot', 'saw', 'Rita', 'Hayworth', 'film', 'quot', 'Gilda', 'quot', 'quot', 'Green', 'Miles', 'quot', 'musical', 'classic', 'quot', 'Top', 'Hat.', 'quot', 'say', 'Hollywood', 'no', 'longer', 'what', 'should', 'be', 'again', 'took', 'Jimmy', 'Stewart', 'material', 'quot', 'Majestic', 'quot', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'role', 'Peter', 'screenwriter', 'McCarthy', 'period', 'lot', 'references', 'old', 'Hollywood', 'movies', 'again.Peter', 'tired', 'hackeyed', 'work', 'described', 'Fitzgerald', 'funny', 'quot', 'Pat', 'Hobby', 'quot', 'stories', 'stupid', 'ideas', 'studio', 'bosses', 'suddenly', 'given', 'life', 'when', 'car', 'accident', 'memories', 'stranded', 'shore', 'small', 'town', 'people', 'town', 'recognize', 'Luke', 'war', 'hero', 'supposed', 'be', 'dead', 'now', 'coming', 'back', 'there', 'symbol', 'hope', 'new', 'life', 'Luke', 'love', 'girl', 'finally', 're-opens', 'theater', 'quot', 'Majestic.', 'quot', 'Everything', 'all', 'right', 'as', 'well', 'FBI', 'remember', 'lost', 'identity', 'fact', 'blacklisted', 'UnAmerican', 'Activity', 'Subcommittee.The', 'rest', 'story', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'told', 'not', 'hard', 'task', 'anyone', 'imagine', 'moment', 'surely', 'power', 'sincerity', 'good', 'performance', 'Carrey', 'playing', 'Peter', 'wavering', 'two', 'ways', 'life', 'choose', 'problem', 'too', 'long', 'time', 'reach', 'there', 'often', 'case', 'Darabont', 'films', 'film', 'nearly', '1', 'hour', 'opening', 'part', 'set', 'up', 'situation', 'helped', 'Carrey', 'serious', 'vein', 'Martin', 'Landau', 'quot', 'quot', 'film', 'sometime', 'undeniably', 'self-indulgent', 'Actually', 'slept', 'while', 'Sorry', 'true', 'more', 'fundamental', 'problem', 'have', 'much', 'superior', 'film', 'value', 'quot', 'Majestic', 'quot', 'champions', 'quot', 'Front', 'quot', 'starring', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'directed', 'Martin', 'Ritt', 'Just', 'take', 'look', 'know', 'what', 'mean', 'admit', 'film', 'quot', 'Majestic', 'quot', 'rather', 'fable', 'realistic', 'story', 'meaning', 'too', 'obvious', 'way', 'expressing', 'too', 'far-fetched', 'worthy', 'attempt', 'Hollywood', 'look', 'back', 'dark', 'age', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'use', 'roundabout', 'fashion', 'incredible', 'co-incidences', 'such', 'one', 'character', 'two', 'key', 'incidents', 'life', 'same', 'time', 'small', 'townspeople', 'believing', 'Peter', 'Luke', 'when', 'summoned', 'committee', 'etc', 'Finally', 'what', 'disagree', 'film', 'most', 'very', 'easy', 'naive', 'conclusion', 'proceedings', 'Committee', 'What', 'happened', 'Chaplin', 'who', 'had', 'live', 'Europe', 'leaving', 'America', 'what', 'did', 'scriptwriter', 'Dalton', 'Trumbo', 'do', 'when', 'was', 'blacklisted', 'used', 'quot', 'quot', 'work', 'quot', 'Roman', 'Holiday', 'quot', 'know', 'historical', 'things', 'never', 'appreciate', 'finale', 'Darabont', 'wanted', 'do', ""n't"", 'deny', 'good-intention', 'value', 'film', 'allegorical', 'meanings', 'film', 'too', 'long', 'too', 'thin', 'most', 'misguiding', 'thinking', 'important', 'age', 'history', 'modern', 'America']",N/A

He's one of the best directors in the business and he has created another gem with the delightful film, THE MAJESTIC.The film takes place in the late 1950's. A cynical screenwriter, Peter Appleton (Jim Carrey) discovers that he is being investigated by Congress for ""un-American activities."" Peter is blacklisted, gets drunk, goes for a drive, and ends up falling off a bridge into a river. He is awakened on a beach by a dog and discovers he has amnesia. Peter ""looks familiar"" to everyone he meets and is eventually mistaken for someone else, a guy named Luke.Jim Carrey is wonderful. He's a great actor with a Jimmy Stewart/Tom Hanks everyman persona. His portrayal of Peter/Luke has all the charm of Stewart's George Bailey.Darabont has said he has always wanted to make a Frank Capra-type film. He has succeeded with THE MAJESTIC. It contains the classic Capra formula: lovable everyman rises to defend all that is good and wholesome about America, becomes a hero, and wins the girl. Darabont tweeks the formula a little, but remains true to the Capra system.Several scenes are taken directly from Capra pictures. When Peter falls off the bridge and awakens in a new life, it reminded me of George Bailey in IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE. When Peter testifies before a Congressional hearing, images of Jimmy Stewart as Mr. Smith in MR. SMITH GOES TO WASHINGTON kept coming to mind.THE MAJESTIC is Capraesque in another significant way. Capra elevated the ordinary man in his films to illustrate the nobility in all and uphold all that is good in America. THE MAJESTIC does this, but it upholds one particular aspect of American life: it reveres the movies. It illuminates them and speaks of them as they were meant to be. People have always love movies, but movies have lost much of the luster that once made them grand. THE MAJESTIC seeks to reclaim the glory of times past by instilling the lesson of why movies are good.Several critics have panned THE MAJESTIC for being too sentimental. Critics said the same thing about Capra and IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE.

But important values are brought out and it is a fine, wholesome, sentimental, romantic story.",5,Fantastic movie that deserves more stars,1266364800,"02 17, 2010",2010,896,"['enjoy', 'time', 'period', 'movie', 'focus', 'love', 'freedom', 'family', 'friendship', 'appreciation', 'military', 'touching', 'love', 'story', 'interesting', 'twist', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'not', 'favorite', 'actor', 'may', 'be', 'best', 'movie', 'role', 'played', 'part', 'exceptionally', 'well', 'other', 'actors', 'did', 'fine', 'job', 'as', 'well', 'especially', 'love', 'interest', 'Laurie', 'Holden', 'enjoy', 'romance', 'dramas', 'one', 'best', 'are', 'going', 'find', 'Frankly', 'compared', 'lot', 'junk', 'awards', 'movie', 'much', 'better', 'should', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'overlooked', 'rare', 'hidden', 'gem', 'answer', 'harsh', 'critical', 'reviews', 'course', 'artistic', 'license', 'used', 'here', 'elements', 'are', 'unrealistic', 'hollywood', 'movie', 'crying', 'out', 'loud', 'important', 'values', 'are', 'brought', 'out', 'fine', 'wholesome', 'sentimental', 'romantic', 'story']",N/A

They seem to imply that the sentiments are phoney and that it should have been a Capra type satire......A small town that lost 60 of its sons in the war.  Exceptionally bad luck for such a small place... like what happened to the community of Deer Island, Maine during the Civil War.  The impact of that can tear the heart out of a community... especially after the war when it turns out that all evil has *not* been vanquished in the world... Growing up in the 1950s, I knew many families that had lost sons, fathers, brothers in WWII... ""Gold Star"" flags still showed in windows... the number of stars represented the number of sons lost (blue stars showed sons serving)...The apparent return of the most distinguished of the boys thought to be dead... nine years later... gives the town a shot of hope and enthusiasm... The HUAC plot is disposable compared to the unfolding of the story in the community.  Martin Landau is splendid... and his ""son's"" return in his waning days justifies any incorrect identification.",5,An underrated film...,1356825600,"12 30, 2012",2012,1129,"['Jim', 'Carrey', 'real', 'talent', 'welcome', 'serious', 'role', 'reviews', 'have', 'read', 'seem', 'imply', 'sentiments', 'are', 'phoney', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'Capra', 'type', 'satire', 'small', 'town', 'lost', '60', 'sons', 'war', 'Exceptionally', 'bad', 'luck', 'such', 'small', 'place', 'what', 'happened', 'community', 'Deer', 'Island', 'Maine', 'Civil', 'War', 'impact', 'can', 'tear', 'heart', 'community', 'especially', 'war', 'when', 'out', 'evil', '*not*', 'been', 'vanquished', 'world', 'Growing', 'up', '1950s', 'knew', 'many', 'families', 'had', 'lost', 'sons', 'fathers', 'brothers', 'WWII', 'Gold', 'Star', 'flags', 'still', 'showed', 'windows', 'number', 'stars', 'represented', 'number', 'sons', 'lost', 'blue', 'stars', 'showed', 'sons', 'serving', 'apparent', 'return', 'most', 'distinguished', 'boys', 'thought', 'be', 'dead', 'nine', 'years', 'later', 'town', 'shot', 'hope', 'enthusiasm', 'HUAC', 'plot', 'disposable', 'compared', 'unfolding', 'story', 'community', 'Martin', 'Landau', 'splendid', 'son', 'return', 'waning', 'days', 'incorrect', 'identification']",N/A
589934,AP3B615GM191G,B00005JKNB,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[1, 2]","In this film, Jim Carrey makes his transition from rubber-faced funnyman to straight-laced dramatic.  The result is a decent enough movie that will entertain (though not outright enthrall) audiences for the duration.For a basic plot summary, ""The Majestic"" tells the story of Peter Appleton (Carrey), a Hollywood writer run out of town by Red Scare McCarthyism.  After an automobile accident, Peter finds himself without his memory and being identified in another town as a long-lost WW2 MIA soldier.  The quest to determine his real identity ensues.If you are a fan of sappy, dripping-with-emotion, folksy period pieces, this will be a 5-star effort in your book.  That sounds like a scathing criticism, but the intent is not malicious here.  What ""The Majestic"" sets out to do well, it generally accomplishes.  The soundtrack evokes strong emotion, the characters are very likable, and some moments may see the eyes welling up.However, at the same time, ""The Majestic"" fails to fall anywhere near truly great.  It utilizes too many genres (mystery, romance, drama, politics, etc.) and doesn't mesh them well enough, it is utterly predictable, and never really challenges the viewer in any meaningful way.  We are just ""along for the ride"".Thus, though by no means a classic film, ""The Majestic"" will likely entertain all and captivate some.  It is a great simple, family-safe film that might just warm your heart a bit too.",3,A Decent Period Piece,1312848000,"08 9, 2011",2011,1425,"['film', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'transition', 'rubber-faced', 'funnyman', 'straight-laced', 'dramatic', 'result', 'decent', 'enough', 'movie', 'will', 'entertain', 'not', 'outright', 'enthrall', 'audiences', 'duration.For', 'basic', 'plot', 'summary', 'Majestic', 'story', 'Peter', 'Appleton', 'Carrey', 'Hollywood', 'writer', 'run', 'town', 'Red', 'Scare', 'McCarthyism', 'automobile', 'accident', 'Peter', 'memory', 'being', 'identified', 'town', 'long-lost', 'WW2', 'MIA', 'soldier', 'quest', 'determine', 'real', 'identity', 'ensues.If', 'are', 'fan', 'sappy', 'dripping-with-emotion', 'folksy', 'period', 'pieces', 'will', 'be', '5-star', 'effort', 'book', 'scathing', 'criticism', 'intent', 'not', 'malicious', 'here', 'What', 'Majestic', 'out', 'do', 'well', 'generally', 'soundtrack', 'strong', 'emotion', 'characters', 'are', 'very', 'likable', 'moments', 'may', 'see', 'eyes', 'welling', 'up.However', 'same', 'time', 'Majestic', 'fall', 'anywhere', 'truly', 'great', 'too', 'many', 'genres', 'mystery', 'romance', 'drama', 'politics', 'etc', ""n't"", 'mesh', 'well', 'enough', 'utterly', 'predictable', 'never', 'really', 'viewer', 'meaningful', 'way', 'are', 'just', 'along', 'ride', '.Thus', 'means', 'classic', 'film', 'Majestic', 'will', 'likely', 'entertain', 'captivate', 'great', 'simple', 'family-safe', 'film', 'might', 'just', 'warm', 'heart', 'bit', 'too']",N/A
