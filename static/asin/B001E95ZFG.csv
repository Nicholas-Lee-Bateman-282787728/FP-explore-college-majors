The actors work very well together and do fine justice to a robustly-dialogued and smart script.There are numerous symbols that are well-placed in the scenes of the film. These are the ""secondary actors"" in Elegy, and their buttressing and enhancing of the dialogue will merit a second viewing for filmgoers who concentrate on the acting. The redemptive power of art is also an undercurrent - especially when an ideal, Goya's ""Maja"" painting so beloved by the Kingsley character, becomes ironically enfleshed in the present to summon and claim his love at the movie's end.This film is not for the lower middlebrow and the special effects/action crowd. And while thoughtful, it can deliver strong emotional scenes such as when Kingsley's once-worldly academic colleague tearfully reaches to both his wife - and then Kingsley! - and tearfully kisses both of them from his sickbed.

You also have the friend who dies, the main character who gets sick, the son who can't relate to his father, and so the list goes on. The acting from Kingsley, Hopper and Cruz is superb, as usual, and I suppose some people might relate to this kind of an attempt to delve into human relations.

Patricia Clarkson is his part time lover and Dennis Hopper plays his confidante and friend. The film's main theme is about the decisions we make and confronting aging and death.

I enjoyed it but by the end of the film thought that, somehow, I'd been short changed.David Kepesh (Ben Kingsley) is a New York based arts professor who has a simple life that involves having sex but avoiding any consequences especially attachment to a partner.  All is fine until he beds Consuela Castillo (Penelope Cruz) who is some thirty years his junior and a student in one of his classes.  Kepesh finds himself strangely falling for this Cuban beauty and his life becomes unbalanced.  But the attraction is double sided.  Consuela is also attracted to Kepesh.However, the relationship collapses when the professor is unable to bring himself to attend a graduation party thrown by Consuela's parents.  Consuela is distraught and does not even call Kepesh again until some years later when she learns that she has cancer.  It is here that the relationship is rekindled but on a different basis.By and large, ""Elegy"" is a study of human relations.  The plot is thin but the personalities are very believable.  Who hasn't put him or herself in some position at some time that is at least partly covered by the film?  All of us have feet of clay.

1184824,A2QHM5HBSIXRL4,B001E95ZFG,Andy Orrock,"[20, 21]","The first 30 minutes or so of Elegy were a bit uncomfortable...the idea and sight of Ben Kingsley's 60-ish character trying to seduce (well, ""woo"" as he jokingly tells his professor pal played by Dennis Hopper) a playing-24-year-old Penelope Cruz will do that.  But that uncomfortableness slowly lessens as you see the maturity that Cruz's character possesses...and the immaturity displayed by Kingsley's David Kepesh.  As Hopper's character pointedly tells Kepesh, ""You need to grow old...and grow up.""  It's a spot-on piece of advice.This serious, small movie ends up being a real pleasure for fans of intelligent movie-making.  This one has it all: the pedigree of a Philip Roth novel; adapted for the screen by Nicholas Meyer; superbly directed by Isabel Coixet; and a first-rate cast of Kingsley, Cruz, Hopper, Patricia Clarkson, and Peter Sarsgaard. Moreover, there's the Easter Egg-like treat of a performance by Deborah Harry, almost unrecognizable out of her erstwhile Blondie persona.Of special note are the one-on-one scenes between Kingsley and Hopper.  You can tell they had a lot of fun together.  There's a deep respect for each others' talents that plays out on the screen.  The DVD's featurette confirms this:  Kingsley speaks of ""Dennis' rhythm as an actor"" (that's a great observation), while Hopper speaks glowingly of ""working with Sir Ben.""Cruz continues to be a revelation.  When trying to break into English-speaking roles, she made a string of stinkers.  Now, withVolver,Vicky Cristina Barcelonaand Elegy, she's entered a pantheon of actresses inhabited by very few.  Not many women of her stature could pull off what she does in Elegy: age 33+ in the filming, she's a 24-year-old graduate student in this film.  From the moment she walks into Kingsley's class, you believe it.  She's stunning, classy and youthful.  Now, juxtapose that vs. the world-weariness she needed to exhibit to pull off what she did inVolver.

Think about whether you really want to spend an hour and fifty-two minutes with the man who said it.It is an hour and fifty-two minutes, because neither Kepesh, Consuela Castillo (Pen&eacute;lope Cruz) nor even any of the minor characters grow during this film at all. They get slapped about by life, love and their own weaknesses, but they finish just as shallow and empty as they begin, having learned nothing at all. Even that would be alright if ""Elegy"" made us feel their pain, but it doesn't.I haven't read the Phillip Roth novella, ""The Dying Animal,"" on which ""Elegy"" is based, but I can guess that it carries a current of bitterness and rage that was omitted from the film in a misguided attempt to make it more palatable. What's left is a lifeless picture about hollow characters. Why is David so attracted to Consuela? Presumably sex was the initial motivator, but even that is portrayed so blandly that it's hard to imagine this man-of-the-world is particularly excited about it. Why is Consuela attracted to David? His worldly sophistication would be the most plausible reason, but we never see him do anything much to broaden her world.Late in the film, Consuela comes to David in a time of crisis. She is not an idiot, so she cannot be coming to him for support. (If you have already seen the film, recall the question she asks: whether he would still want something if a certain thing happened. Notice that he can't answer, and lacks even the good grace to fake it. She appears a bit disappointed, but, reasonably considering their history, not surprised.)I believe this is meant to be a focal point of the story, but while I think I can piece together what I was supposed to feel, I didn't feel it while watching the movie. Consuela asks David to do something for her that she says she can ask only of him, and the product of this can be seen as the ""Elegy"" of the title, at least from her point of view. In his review of the film, Roger Ebert remarks that the fulfilling of this request is something he thinks ""we might be better off hearing about, instead of seeing."" I think the opposite is true. The scene is played so flatly and politely that we have to think about it later to understand how Consuela must have felt. We should have been made to feel it ourselves --- Consuela's pride and desperation, humiliation and rage, probably the first thing she ever really shared with David, the real reason he was the only one to whom she could come --- but this movie lacks the nerve to go there.""Elegy"" is a well-acted love story between two people who are not particularly lovable, who have no motivations we can see or feel to love one another, and who experience no insights or growth that would make them interesting. I suspect it was originally an ugly story; somewhere between the screenwriting and the direction it was softened, and that left behind a tale that has no real reason to be told.",3,What's wrong with this picture?,1245628800,"06 22, 2009",2009,3131,"['one', 'point', 'narration', 'Elegy', 'Professor', 'David', 'Kepesh', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'When', 'make', 'love', 'woman', 'get', 'revenge', 'things', 'defeated', 'life', 'Think', 'moment', 'Think', 'really', 'want', 'spend', 'hour', 'fifty-two', 'minutes', 'man', 'who', 'said', 'it.It', 'hour', 'fifty-two', 'minutes', 'Kepesh', 'Consuela', 'Castillo', 'Pen', 'eacute', 'Cruz', 'even', 'minor', 'characters', 'grow', 'film', 'get', 'slapped', 'life', 'love', 'own', 'weaknesses', 'finish', 'just', 'shallow', 'empty', 'begin', 'having', 'learned', 'nothing', 'Even', 'would', 'be', 'alright', 'Elegy', 'made', 'feel', 'pain', ""doesn't.I"", 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'Phillip', 'Roth', 'novella', 'Dying', 'Animal', 'Elegy', 'based', 'can', 'guess', 'current', 'bitterness', 'rage', 'was', 'omitted', 'film', 'misguided', 'attempt', 'make', 'more', 'palatable', 'What', 'left', 'lifeless', 'picture', 'hollow', 'characters', 'Why', 'David', 'so', 'attracted', 'Consuela', 'Presumably', 'sex', 'was', 'initial', 'motivator', 'even', 'portrayed', 'so', 'blandly', 'hard', 'imagine', 'man-of-the-world', 'particularly', 'excited', 'Why', 'Consuela', 'attracted', 'David', 'worldly', 'sophistication', 'would', 'be', 'most', 'plausible', 'reason', 'never', 'see', 'do', 'anything', 'much', 'broaden', 'world.Late', 'film', 'Consuela', 'David', 'time', 'crisis', 'not', 'idiot', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'coming', 'support', 'have', 'already', 'seen', 'film', 'recall', 'question', 'would', 'still', 'want', 'something', 'certain', 'thing', 'happened', 'Notice', 'ca', ""n't"", 'answer', 'lacks', 'even', 'good', 'grace', 'fake', 'bit', 'disappointed', 'reasonably', 'considering', 'history', 'not', 'surprised', 'believe', 'meant', 'be', 'focal', 'point', 'story', 'think', 'can', 'piece', 'together', 'what', 'was', 'supposed', 'feel', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'watching', 'movie', 'Consuela', 'David', 'do', 'something', 'can', 'ask', 'only', 'product', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'Elegy', 'title', 'least', 'point', 'view', 'review', 'film', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'remarks', 'fulfilling', 'request', 'something', 'might', 'be', 'better', 'off', 'hearing', 'instead', 'seeing', 'think', 'opposite', 'true', 'scene', 'played', 'so', 'flatly', 'politely', 'have', 'think', 'later', 'understand', 'how', 'Consuela', 'must', 'have', 'felt', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'feel', 'Consuela', 'pride', 'desperation', 'humiliation', 'rage', 'probably', 'first', 'thing', 'ever', 'really', 'shared', 'David', 'real', 'reason', 'was', 'only', 'one', 'whom', 'could', 'come', 'movie', 'nerve', 'go', 'there', 'Elegy', 'well-acted', 'love', 'story', 'two', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'particularly', 'lovable', 'who', 'have', 'motivations', 'can', 'see', 'feel', 'love', 'one', 'who', 'experience', 'insights', 'growth', 'would', 'make', 'interesting', 'suspect', 'was', 'originally', 'ugly', 'story', 'somewhere', 'screenwriting', 'direction', 'was', 'softened', 'left', 'tale', 'real', 'reason', 'be', 'told']",N/A
1184831,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B001E95ZFG,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[1, 3]","A touching film featuring a wonderful performance by Ben Kingsley!""Elegy"" is based on a novel titled ""The Dying Animal"" by Philip Roth, known for several novels he has written since the 1960's which include ""The Human Stain"" (1984) and ""Goodbye Columbus"" (1969), the film's screenplay is by Nicholas Meyer who wrote the screenplay for Roth's novel ""The Human Stain"" in 2003 and directed by well-known French writer and director Isabel Coixet (""Invisibles"", ""Paris, Je t'aime"", etc.).Ben Kingsley plays the role of David Kepesh, a well-respected cultural critic, author, radio host and college professor and has lived in a state of ""emancipated manhood"".Known for his romantic conquests (especially with his college students), Kingsley and his best friend George O'Hearn (Dennis Hopper) often discuss their lives of being middle-age and marriage or divorce and how to stay happy.  Especially sexually with your wife or as you grow older.David is not the type of man who commits to a woman, he continues to have a sexual relationship (for over two decades) with a former student Carolyn (Patricia Clarkson), who visits Kepesh everytime she's in town.  His relationship with his estranged son Kenneth (Peter Sarsgaard) is as cold as ice despite the two trying to find ways to have a relationship. But for David, he learned from his last marriage that he's not the marrying or committing type.But life changes for David one day as his student Consuela Castillo (Penelop Cruz) catches his attention.  Adoring her body as a work of art, the two develop an erotic relationship in which in one instance, he knows that she's the best he's had sexually and even on a personal level.  But the fact that he is 30-years-older than her, he feels that with the evolution of life, with her being so young, she will eventually find a young man and move on.  He is so interested in her but he feels that he needs to distance himself from her and not get too close.But that's not the case for Consuela.Despite having relationships and dating other men, she is passionately in love with David and to her, age has no boundaries and she tries her best to have him love her.  Not just for the sex or her body but to love her completely.Thus, David Kepesh is in a situation he has never been in before.  His thoughts on growing old and not wanting to commit to anyone is being tested by this young woman who wants to be loved and he knows he has deep feelings for her but will he allow himself to be in love?VIDEO & AUDIO:""Elegy"" is featured in 1:85:1 anamorphic widescreen.  Picture quality is pretty good and a nice contrast of brightness from outdoor scenes to the darker tones when David Kepesh is alone in his room.Audio is in Dolby Digital 5.1 but the film is primarily a dialogue-based film.  Front channel audio, easy to understand and quite clear.SPECIAL FEATURES:There are two special features on the ""Elegy"" DVD.  Included are:* Audio Commentary - This commentary features optional audio commentary with Screenwriter Nicholas Meyer.  There are quite a bit of pauses but Meyer does provide insight on scenes that he changed from the novel to the screenplay.  For example, why Kenneth Kepesh is a doctor and why he used silence in certain parts of the film.* ""The Poetry of Elegy"" Featurette - A short 5-minute featurette featuring interviews with director Isabel Coixet, Ben Kingsley, Penelope Cruz and Dennis Hopper.  Showing behind-the-scenes footage and interviews with the talent in regards to working with each other and being a part of this film.JUDGMENT CALL:""Elegy"" is a film about men who grow older, enjoyed their sexual past but want to continue that even as they grow older.  But it's when they start to discover whether or not they can still be happy being with that one person forever.There are simply many layers to the character of David Kepesh but the film works with it's supporting characters.  Dennis Hopper and Patricia Clarkson do a wonderful job in providing another perspective of two individuals who handle things differently as they grow older but it's just the inner turmoil of Kepesh that keeps the film interesting.  As for Penelope Cruz, she does a very good job as Consuela and as she begins as a student and then eventually when she enters her late 20's or early 30's.I will say that the film goes at a slow pace but it's a pacing necessary to show Kepesh's strength and weaknesses as a man, despite accomplishing so much in his professional life, his personal life is a bit different.  And to see his relationship with Consuela become so passionate and erotic but then developing into more than that and he becomes conflicted with his emotions.In a way, I'm not sure if younger viewers can appreciate the film on a level of those who have grown older and have similar feelings and emotions as these characters.  I've read reviews from those who were older and felt the film was spectacular and those who were younger and felt the film was too slow and boring for them.Personally, for me, I definitely can understand the perspective of both Kepesh and O'Hearn's characters.  I don't know how many times I've had conversations with men and women, of similar age, that one would remember how things were when they were young and how things change when they got older.  But depending on one's perspective in life and how they live their lives and how they can make the best out of it.""Elegy"" is a film that I really enjoyed.  It may not be for everyone but nevertheless, I was truly entertained.",4,"A touching film about love, age and sex!

For an American film to be so sensitive and have good dialogue is a rarity these days--but this one scored for me!  Ben Kingsley turns in perhaps his best performance thus far and Penelope Cruz delivers in a finely shaded portrait of the Cuban student that the jaded professor (Kingsley) ultimately falls for but is at first unable to commit.  Dennis Hopper also turns in a fine, subtle (for him that's surprising) performance as Kingsley best friend, a hedonistic poetry teacher.  The rest of the cast is also superb with Patricia Clarkson as Kingsley's regular sex partner and Peter Saarsguard as his estranged son.  The film drew me in because of Roth's message in that we should pay attention to our hearts--if we don't we miss an opportunity for happiness.  This film should've been one that Penelope Cruz should've won rather than ""Vicky, Christina, Barcelona"" yet this is in many ways--her year!!  I will probably check this one out again on video--it's much better than the translation of ""The Human Stain"" which is similiar in the May-December romance of an older man and a younger woman.",4,a surprising gem which has Ben Kingsley's best performance so far,1242172800,"05 13, 2009",2009,1223,"['had', 'seen', 'film', 'directed', 'Spanish', 'director', 'Isabel', 'Coixtel', 'theater', 'was', 'mildly', 'surprised', 'would', 'like', 'American', 'film', 'be', 'so', 'sensitive', 'have', 'good', 'dialogue', 'rarity', 'days', 'one', 'scored', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'perhaps', 'best', 'performance', 'thus', 'far', 'Penelope', 'Cruz', 'delivers', 'finely', 'shaded', 'portrait', 'Cuban', 'student', 'jaded', 'professor', 'Kingsley', 'ultimately', 'first', 'unable', 'commit', 'Dennis', 'Hopper', 'also', 'fine', 'subtle', 'surprising', 'performance', 'Kingsley', 'best', 'friend', 'hedonistic', 'poetry', 'teacher', 'rest', 'cast', 'also', 'superb', 'Patricia', 'Clarkson', 'Kingsley', 'regular', 'sex', 'partner', 'Peter', 'Saarsguard', 'estranged', 'son', 'film', 'drew', 'Roth', 'message', 'should', 'pay', 'attention', 'hearts', 'do', ""n't"", 'miss', 'opportunity', 'happiness', 'film', 'should', ""'ve"", 'been', 'one', 'Penelope', 'Cruz', 'should', ""'ve"", 'won', 'rather', 'Vicky', 'Christina', 'Barcelona', 'yet', 'many', 'ways', 'year', 'will', 'probably', 'check', 'one', 'out', 'again', 'video', 'much', 'better', 'translation', 'Human', 'Stain', 'similiar', 'May-December', 'romance', 'older', 'man', 'younger', 'woman']",N/A
1184833,A293HA28PN3VO4,B001E95ZFG,":::DIGITAL BABE::: "":::DIGITAL BABE:::""","[0, 0]","This review is for the Blu-Ray. I viewed this film on a 42"" Panasonic Plasma & BD35 Player. This is a very sad film about the perpetual chase of youth that humanity engages in, as it gets older. David and Consuela find themselves on an unlikely path of love, with a 30 year age difference, and different ideas of what love is.Consuela's yearning to have David in her life as a ""real"" entity clashes violently with David's fear of losing her to a youth that he feels, he no longer possesses. She defines herself with her beauty, and sadly it seems that when she has her operation, due to breast cancer, she no longer believes she is lovable. David's character is also not clear on what exactly about Consuela appeals to him-he is overwhelmed by her beauty and intellect, but afraid that he cannot possibly be what she needs in her young life. Thus both live behind an insurmountable barrier, tainted in part by David's perceptions of commitment (marriage is a prison).The scenes where David lies and tells Consuela that he is broken down on a bridge and therefore cannot attend her graduation, her asking him to photograph her before her operation, to, in a sense preserve her beauty, and David's tears when she tells him that she has breast cancer, were the most effective scenes for me, in this film.The film is sad, but also encourages perspective. It also seems to communicate the genuineness that eminates from people, when faced with life, death and age. The relationship between David and his friend, is almost like a marriage.When his friend dies, and he kisses him on the mouth, it creates the type of mystery and confusion,that, though a little surprising (I didn't see any signs that there was a sexual attraction all along), but it creates a reevaluation of what constitutes intimacy.It's one of those that causes a refocus, and to appreciate what is in the hear and now, and to cherish true love, or at least to believe in it. Visually it's beautiful, and the colors in the Blu-Ray are very rich. There was some noise in lighter scenes,but overall, there is a beautiful clarity and detail. Performances by Kingsley, Hopper and Cruz are engaging, subtle, and effective.

This is a superb chick flick, filled to overflowing with love, passion, tenderness, and an ending that will have you sighing ... after crying!  I bought this, on impulse, the moment I saw it and am thrilled - it truly is a great film.  It portrays a unique, moving passion between two people very much in love despite age and generational differences.Sir Ben Kingsley and Penelope Cruz truly deliver in this movie.  Kingsley plays David Kepesh, a published intellectual critic and professor who has a strong aversion to both love and commitment.  Ironically, the only sustaining relationships he has at the beginning of the movie are his best friend, George, and Caroline - a woman he has shared a twenty year noncommital, no-strings-attached sexual affair.  His grown son hates him for walking out on a marriage David describes as a prison.  But he is content with his love-free, complication-free life.Enter Consuela (Penelope Cruz), a beautiful dark-haired Cuban-American student.  She exudes intelligence, maturity, and sophistication.  Her beauty immediately captures David's eye, but he holds back until she is no longer his student (to avoid any claims of sexual harassment).  It's her personality that draws him in ... tempting him to get to know her, to woo her, instead of merely seducing her.Their courtship is romantic ... they truly love each other.  And David is now in a strange situation in his life ... he's experiencing his first bouts of jealousy and obsession, fearing the day when Consuela is seduced away from him by a younger man.  David fears the 30+ year age difference, though Consuela doesn't care about it at all.  When David's friend George convinces him it is time to end the relationship, David can't bring himself to do it... instead he suggests they go away to Europe together.  Despite the happiness they share, he gives into his fear of a broken heart and breaks it off.David and Consuela go their separate ways, for a couple of years.  Just when David thinks he has finally gotten over that powerful love, he receives a call from Consuela indicating that it's urgent they meet.  Consuela's news is shocking ... and leaves David with a very important choice.What I loved about this movie is the chemistry between Sir Ben Kingsley and Penelope Cruz.  Both actors play David and Consuela's relationship with tenderness and maturity, making the viewer aware that this is NOT a mere fling.

1184835,A280GY5UVUS2QH,B001E95ZFG,Doug Anderson,"[1, 2]","Elegy begins with renowned New York author/celebrity/cultural critic David Kepesh (Ben Kinglsey) fielding questions about his new book from Charlie Rose. The new book is about an early American sect of pleasure worshippers who were shut down by the dominant Puritan culture, and so we are led to presume that David is one of those aging hipsters who still mourns that other moment in American life, the 1960's, when Eden seemed more than just a myth. This presumption is further supported by the fact that David's best friend, George O'Hearn, is played by none other than aging hipster Dennis Hopper.But first impressions are not always accurate, and the more we get to know both David and George the more we begin to realize that neither of these New York literary bigwigs is really what they appear to be. They chat every afternoon in a coffee shop but neither of them really seems able to open up to the other and though close one senses that both men have intimacy issues not just with women but with people in general. In many ways these conversations are the most interesting part of the film for it is in these apparently casual conversations between friends that each man attempts to make sense of himself and it becomes clear that neither has a handle on exactly what kind of person he (or his friend) is.David is one of those New York intellectuals who does a bit of everything: he's a theatre critic, a university lecturer, a photographer, a pianist, a regular on the PBS talk & radio show circuit and he presents himself as a fiercely independent and restless loner. Even though he has been carrying on an affair with the same woman for twenty years, he is convinced that he is not the marrying type. But just what ""type"" he is is unclear until the very end (and, perhaps, remains unclear even then). What seems clear early on is that he is the type who sets his sights on sexy grad students when his lover is out of town. He seems to be a tenured and prudent lothario, one who is careful not to get involved with his sexy grad students before the term is over, but once grades have been posted he throws end-of-term cocktail parties at his apartment and it is there that he does what elder professers with or without a certain amount of celebrity often do: he seduces grad students. When he sets his sights on Consuela (Penelope Cruz) and chats her up all night he is at least honest enough to admit to himself what he really wants. But as the days go by and Consuela and he spend more and more time together David starts to question just what he really does want. George tells him to enjoy it for what it is but David is never certain just exactly what ""it"" is.What complicates matters is that David seems confused by his own emotions. Being the in-demand scholar/celebrity/cultural critic that he is, he is used to getting his way and being in control. But with Consuela he no longer has that sense of control over his life, and he doesn't know how to handle the fact that someone has such power over him. David is used to being around beauty in the form of painting and photography and music and theatre but not used to being around real live in the flesh beauty and he is simply bewildered in Consuela's presence. This newfound vulnerability makes him more likable as a human being, but it also scares him.Friend George, and his own conscience, tell him the affair is bound to end, but he doesn't want it to and despite his avowed sense of independence he finds that he simply cannot function without her. At a crucial moment, however, he hesitates...and he lets her slip away.Although the premise is inviting and engaging enough, the romantic element is subdued and, yes, elegiac. David's inability to connect with other human beings is profoundly sad and moving and Kingsely does a brilliant job with the role but the character's ambivalence about all forms of human connectivity (along with his utter lack of humor) makes this character, and, ultimately this film, a difficult one to cozy up to. Penelope Cruz is always alluring but here she plays a quiet doe-eyed cipher who looks at her accomplished professor like a child looking up at its father. Beyond her surface beauty we are never certain just what David is connecting to and neither does David and that is what is intriguing but also frustrating about the film.Ultimately, David finds that George (despite his status as one of New York's most important poets) has not been honest with any of the people in his life. And this makes David question whether he too has been honest with the people in his.Its difficult to judge a film like this. It is not a particularly romantic film, and, one suspects, that the central character's solipsism is more suited to literary than cinematic art, but it is an interesting and moody meditation on one man's late-life transformation.",4,Intriguing but also frustrating,1237248000,"03 17, 2009",2009,4850,"['Elegy', 'renowned', 'New', 'York', 'author/celebrity/cultural', 'critic', 'David', 'Kepesh', 'Ben', 'Kinglsey', 'fielding', 'questions', 'new', 'book', 'Charlie', 'Rose', 'new', 'book', 'early', 'American', 'sect', 'pleasure', 'worshippers', 'who', 'were', 'shut', 'down', 'dominant', 'Puritan', 'culture', 'so', 'are', 'led', 'presume', 'David', 'one', 'aging', 'hipsters', 'who', 'still', 'other', 'moment', 'American', 'life', '1960', 'when', 'Eden', 'seemed', 'more', 'just', 'myth', 'presumption', 'further', 'supported', 'fact', 'David', 'best', 'friend', 'George', ""O'Hearn"", 'played', 'none', 'other', 'aging', 'hipster', 'Dennis', 'Hopper.But', 'first', 'impressions', 'are', 'not', 'always', 'accurate', 'more', 'get', 'know', 'David', 'George', 'more', 'begin', 'realize', 'New', 'York', 'literary', 'bigwigs', 'really', 'what', 'appear', 'be', 'chat', 'afternoon', 'coffee', 'shop', 'really', 'able', 'open', 'up', 'other', 'close', 'one', 'men', 'have', 'intimacy', 'issues', 'not', 'just', 'women', 'people', 'general', 'many', 'ways', 'conversations', 'are', 'most', 'interesting', 'part', 'film', 'apparently', 'casual', 'conversations', 'friends', 'man', 'make', 'sense', 'clear', 'handle', 'exactly', 'what', 'kind', 'person', 'friend', 'is.David', 'one', 'New', 'York', 'intellectuals', 'who', 'bit', 'everything', 'theatre', 'critic', 'university', 'lecturer', 'photographer', 'pianist', 'regular', 'PBS', 'talk', 'radio', 'show', 'circuit', 'fiercely', 'independent', 'restless', 'loner', 'Even', 'been', 'carrying', 'affair', 'same', 'woman', 'twenty', 'years', 'convinced', 'not', 'marrying', 'type', 'just', 'what', 'type', 'unclear', 'very', 'end', 'perhaps', 'unclear', 'even', 'then', 'What', 'clear', 'early', 'type', 'who', 'sights', 'sexy', 'grad', 'students', 'when', 'lover', 'town', 'be', 'tenured', 'prudent', 'lothario', 'one', 'who', 'careful', 'not', 'get', 'involved', 'sexy', 'grad', 'students', 'term', 'once', 'grades', 'have', 'been', 'posted', 'end-of-term', 'cocktail', 'parties', 'apartment', 'there', 'what', 'elder', 'professers', 'certain', 'amount', 'celebrity', 'often', 'do', 'grad', 'students', 'When', 'sights', 'Consuela', 'Penelope', 'Cruz', 'up', 'night', 'least', 'honest', 'enough', 'admit', 'what', 'really', 'days', 'go', 'Consuela', 'spend', 'more', 'more', 'time', 'together', 'David', 'question', 'just', 'what', 'really', 'want', 'George', 'enjoy', 'what', 'David', 'never', 'certain', 'just', 'exactly', 'what', 'is.What', 'matters', 'David', 'confused', 'own', 'emotions', 'Being', 'in-demand', 'scholar/celebrity/cultural', 'critic', 'used', 'getting', 'way', 'being', 'control', 'Consuela', 'no', 'longer', 'sense', 'control', 'life', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'handle', 'fact', 'someone', 'such', 'power', 'David', 'used', 'being', 'around', 'beauty', 'form', 'painting', 'photography', 'music', 'theatre', 'not', 'used', 'being', 'around', 'real', 'live', 'flesh', 'beauty', 'simply', 'bewildered', 'Consuela', 'presence', 'newfound', 'vulnerability', 'more', 'likable', 'human', 'being', 'also', 'him.Friend', 'George', 'own', 'conscience', 'tell', 'affair', 'bound', 'end', ""n't"", 'want', 'avowed', 'sense', 'independence', 'simply', 'can', 'not', 'function', 'crucial', 'moment', 'however', 'slip', 'premise', 'inviting', 'engaging', 'enough', 'romantic', 'element', 'subdued', 'yes', 'elegiac', 'David', 'inability', 'connect', 'other', 'human', 'beings', 'profoundly', 'sad', 'moving', 'Kingsely', 'brilliant', 'job', 'role', 'character', 'ambivalence', 'forms', 'human', 'connectivity', 'utter', 'lack', 'humor', 'character', 'ultimately', 'film', 'difficult', 'one', 'cozy', 'up', 'Penelope', 'Cruz', 'always', 'alluring', 'here', 'quiet', 'doe-eyed', 'cipher', 'who', 'accomplished', 'professor', 'child', 'looking', 'up', 'father', 'surface', 'beauty', 'are', 'never', 'certain', 'just', 'what', 'David', 'connecting', 'neither', 'David', 'what', 'intriguing', 'also', 'frustrating', 'film.Ultimately', 'David', 'George', 'status', 'one', 'New', 'York', 'most', 'important', 'poets', 'not', 'been', 'honest', 'people', 'life', 'David', 'question', 'too', 'been', 'honest', 'people', 'his.Its', 'difficult', 'judge', 'film', 'not', 'particularly', 'romantic', 'film', 'one', 'suspects', 'central', 'character', 'solipsism', 'more', 'suited', 'literary', 'cinematic', 'art', 'interesting', 'moody', 'meditation', 'one', 'man', 'late-life', 'transformation']",N/A

I started to get bored during the middle portions and almost quit watching. Yet, there is a quietly compelling quality to this film that caused me to stay with it. While there's not much in the way of reversals or dramatic action, ELEGY is about real people confronting common dilemmas regarding beauty, aging, and mortality. The dialogue is elegant and meaningful; nevertheless, it's nothing larger-than-life: Just about anyone will be able to relate to the obsessions, suspicions, and tender moments that haunt this romance. The cover and title make it look awfully sad but, while it's no comedy per se, it's often funny and generally far less melancholy than it could have been. There's also some sex, but ELEGY's nothing that many people would want to sit through just for a cheap thrill.On the down-side, the relationship between Castillo and Kepesh is hard to buy in places, and it all seems to happen just a bit too quickly and easily. The fact that he's much older than her is obviously a crucial part of the story, but what she really sees in him is never made entirely clear.

Isabel Coixnet has managed to guide her gifted set of actors through this story as though it were a ballet. The result is one of the more beautiful 'love stories' ever filmed.David Kepesh (Ben Kingsley, in a performance of tremendous power and sensitivity) is an aging author, teacher and art critic, a man who has not learned the secret of lasting relationships but who retains his animal sex drive despite his passing years: he survives time's passing by a patterned assignation with Carolyn (Patricia Clarkson), an aging successful traveling business woman who drops in for sensual gratification when in town. David's closest friend is Pulitzer prize winning poet George O'Hearn (Dennis Hopper) who serves as his alter ego and as his confidant in David's problematic life.Into David's classroom comes Consuela Castillo (the ravishingly beautiful and gifted Pen&eacute;lope Cruz) who gains David's focus not only for her radiant beauty but also for her intelligence. Struggling with his advanced years (David is over thirty years older than Consuela), a courtship dance begins and it is the emergence of this romance that forms the story. How Consuela alters David's behavior and his discovery of the need for connection outside of the bedroom is related as a journey through David's mind. The manner in which the transformation changes every member of the story is what makes this film so very memorable.Kingsley is brilliant in this probing examination of the aging man's psyche, Cruz SHOULD have received her Oscar for this performance rather than the film that honored her, Clarkson continues to be one of our best actresses on the screen, Peter Sarsgaard makes a brief but important appearance, and David Hopper manages to step out of his predictable past roles and offer a character of true compassion and finesse. The film is magnificently photographed (Jean-Claude Larrieu) and the music score thankfully is almost completely devoted to the works of Erik Satie (Gnossiennes), Beethoven (Diabelli Variations), Vivaldi (cantatas with Phillipe Jaroussky) -all edited by the director Isabel Coixnet. It all works well. This is one of the finer films of 2008 and deserves a wide audience of people who love quality filmmaking.

Divorced, his affective relation with his son is a real mess. And his two only tie with the real world are -on one hand-  a sensitive poet (Dennis Hopper), who is an epitome of his own shadow; he questions him but reflects many of his convictions when he was young ; the other bound is an old pupil (Patrice Clarkson). His house is an extension of himself (as it must be)a museum in miniature. Memories, antiques treasures, invaluable books and  His powerful intelligence has not grown old, but his youth is missed.Among this universe of contradictions, he meets a warm relationship with an alluring young student (Penelope Cruz). And so, the normal admiration she feels for him and the ardent passion for being loved are blended. The chosen music might not better appropriate. The initial encounter is supported by the meditative variation which belongs to the ""Diabelli variations"". And the erotic sequences are beautifully leaned by the incorporeal lyricism of the Gymnopedies of Eric Satie ( So, Isabel Croixent paid her personal tribute to the famous film ""The immortal story"" with Orson Welles and Jeanne Moreau, from 1968).On the other hand, one cannot forget the visible traces of ""The blue Angel"" (starred by Emil Jennings and Marlene Dietrich and directed by Joseph von Sternberg).

1184843,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B001E95ZFG,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[3, 4]","Elegy is based on the novelThe Dying Animal (Movie Tie-In Edition) (Vintage International)by Philip Roth. The novel is very well written and filled with such a rich vocabulary, you feel like an intellectual reading it. It's not the obvious choice for a film, yet here we have one. If Elegy had finished as well as it began, I would say it was one of the best films of 2008.Ben Kingsley plays David Kepesh, an author and college professor who fears old age creeping up on him. He's divorced, has a middle-aged son who hates him, and his best friend George (Dennis Hopper) is an aging poet who frequently and unapologetically cheats on his wife. Being an older college professor, David enjoys seducing college girls and does so frequently. Than, he spots Consuela (Penelope Cruz), who stands out to David because there is ""a sophistication that sets her apart"" and ""she knows she's beautiful but she's not yet sure what to do with her beauty."" After successfully seducing Consuela, she ceases to be ""just another student"" and Kepesh ends up discovering something more than he expected.Kingsley completely embodies Kepesh. It really feels like Roth's character walked right off the page. He captures both the self-assured, charm and desperate yearning of the character. Cruz does not resemble her literary counterpart, but her performance as Consuela is heartbreaking and perfect. The Academy picked the wrong film to give her an Oscar for.Hopper turns in some strong supporting work, as does Peter Sarsgaard as David's son. Patricia Clarkson gives a stand-out performance as Caroline, who drops in on David for casual sex from time to time.The performances alone make the film worth watching.At the heart of Elegy is a love story. What sets this one apart from most others is the idea of beauty and what's left when it's all gone?The film is much more accessible than the novel but many will be bored anyway. Elegy definitely requires patience. The first 50-odd minutes are hypnotic and unfold gracefully, like poetry. The latter part isn't as mesmerizing or leisurely paced unfortunately. The beauty of both the story of David & Consuela and the wonderful dialogue contained in the film make it worth your time alone.Elegy does possess a lovely ending that leaves the audience much more optimistic than the book did. Despite this and how wonderful much of Elegy is, it's not a masterpiece. I do recommend it however, because for all its faults. You have great performances, memorable dialogue, a spellbinding first act, and a subtle ending. There is poetry in it and that alone warrants your viewing.B+",4,Comes Close to Being a Masterpiece,1238284800,"03 29, 2009",2009,2601,"['Elegy', 'based', 'novelThe', 'Dying', 'Animal', 'Movie', 'Tie-In', 'Edition', 'Vintage', 'International', 'Philip', 'Roth', 'novel', 'very', 'well', 'written', 'filled', 'rich', 'vocabulary', 'feel', 'intellectual', 'reading', 'not', 'obvious', 'choice', 'film', 'yet', 'here', 'have', 'one', 'Elegy', 'had', 'finished', 'as', 'well', 'began', 'would', 'say', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'films', '2008.Ben', 'Kingsley', 'plays', 'David', 'Kepesh', 'author', 'college', 'professor', 'who', 'old', 'age', 'creeping', 'up', 'divorced', 'middle-aged', 'son', 'who', 'best', 'friend', 'George', 'Dennis', 'Hopper', 'aging', 'poet', 'who', 'frequently', 'unapologetically', 'cheats', 'wife', 'Being', 'older', 'college', 'professor', 'David', 'seducing', 'college', 'girls', 'so', 'frequently', 'Than', 'Consuela', 'Penelope', 'Cruz', 'who', 'out', 'David', 'sophistication', 'apart', 'beautiful', 'not', 'yet', 'sure', 'what', 'do', 'beauty', 'successfully', 'seducing', 'Consuela', 'be', 'just', 'student', 'Kepesh', 'up', 'discovering', 'something', 'more', 'completely', 'embodies', 'Kepesh', 'really', 'Roth', 'character', 'walked', 'right', 'page', 'self-assured', 'charm', 'desperate', 'yearning', 'character', 'Cruz', 'not', 'resemble', 'literary', 'counterpart', 'performance', 'Consuela', 'heartbreaking', 'perfect', 'Academy', 'picked', 'wrong', 'film', 'give', 'Oscar', 'for.Hopper', 'strong', 'supporting', 'work', 'Peter', 'Sarsgaard', 'David', 'son', 'Patricia', 'Clarkson', 'stand-out', 'performance', 'Caroline', 'who', 'David', 'casual', 'sex', 'time', 'time.The', 'performances', 'alone', 'make', 'film', 'worth', 'watching.At', 'heart', 'Elegy', 'love', 'story', 'What', 'one', 'apart', 'most', 'others', 'idea', 'beauty', 'what', 'left', 'when', 'gone', 'film', 'much', 'more', 'accessible', 'novel', 'many', 'will', 'be', 'bored', 'anyway', 'Elegy', 'definitely', 'patience', 'first', '50-odd', 'minutes', 'are', 'hypnotic', 'unfold', 'gracefully', 'poetry', 'latter', 'part', ""n't"", 'mesmerizing', 'leisurely', 'paced', 'unfortunately', 'beauty', 'story', 'David', 'Consuela', 'wonderful', 'dialogue', 'contained', 'film', 'make', 'time', 'alone.Elegy', 'possess', 'lovely', 'ending', 'audience', 'much', 'more', 'optimistic', 'book', 'did', 'how', 'wonderful', 'much', 'Elegy', 'not', 'masterpiece', 'do', 'recommend', 'however', 'faults', 'have', 'great', 'performances', 'memorable', 'dialogue', 'spellbinding', 'first', 'act', 'subtle', 'ending', 'poetry', 'alone', 'warrants', 'viewing.B+']",N/A

Eventually that selfishness overcomes his feelings of love for the woman and she disappears from his life although the aftermath of their breakup dogs him as he struggles to come to terms with that and the implications of it.In a conclusion which is not as the plot has carefully laid out, the couple are reunited through a tragic event which allows their feelings to be exposed.This is a tender, slow drama which goes to a great extent to establish the network of relationships between a few people in order to bring forth an analysis of how modern life in a post-industrial society has resulted in fragmentary relations involving sex without love or care and where real relationships are the exception rather than the rule.Each of the actors involved have gone to considerable trouble to avoid extreme positions to create very real and reasonable people who have considerable credibility.

He finds one of his students, a 24-year old beauty named Consuela (Penelope Cruz) to be especially alluring and breaks a rule to go out with her; they fall in love.An elegy is a nostalgic or melancholy musical piece or poem lamenting death, and that sums up the theme of this movie.  Based on a novel by Phillip Roth, it explores a man's many regrets, failings, and losses.  The film starts out quite nicely with the couple's initial attraction, but the second half falls apart with a shallow story and boring dialogue delivered at a snail's pace.  (It's at least half an hour too long.)  The idea of an older man and younger woman being attracted to each other isn't noteworthy these days and there isn't a lot going on here.Kingsley gives an excellent performance as the refined and horny professor and Cruz is very appealing as a strong, sensual young woman, but the script fails them.

When my parents divorced at age 5, I was given such a wound that was demonstrated as a ""shyness"". Society easily gives us that wound, particularly to a woman: ""am I beautiful? Am I beautiful with one breast?""I too initially found my self worth in numerous relationships: they told me I was good enough. And then, if one is unfortunate enough to build a ""super Ego"" as in the case of Kingsley's character, one can sorta continuously keep artificially ""filling this wound"" with ongoing relationships with ""beautiful"" women. Unfortunately the only thing that will truly fill that wound is Love, and sometimes we don't figure out what love is until everything else is gone.Those points described above actually are not well portrayed in the movie, except the part about finding love when all else is gone.

He really has no idea of how to handle it, no idea of what true love is until the end of the movie.How many of us go home alone, and live out a life with no intimacy? And we  do it because we don't know what true love is.And we do it because we are wounded and afraid we aren't good enough. Love is everything good, it is friendship based on knowledge (that we are good enough), understanding(that we aren't perfect; we will screw up), forgiveness and responsibility(to learn from our mistakes, to apologize for our mistakes). It is a commitment, not a feeling. And, as I write this, it is compassion for so many that do not know.",5,The Wound we never see,1325980800,"01 8, 2012",2012,1740,"['Most', 'acquire', 'wound', 'early', 'life', 'are', ""n't"", 'good', 'enough', 'When', 'parents', 'divorced', 'age', '5', 'was', 'given', 'wound', 'was', 'demonstrated', 'shyness', 'Society', 'easily', 'wound', 'particularly', 'woman', 'am', 'beautiful', 'Am', 'beautiful', 'one', 'breast', 'too', 'initially', 'found', 'self', 'worth', 'numerous', 'relationships', 'told', 'was', 'good', 'enough', 'then', 'one', 'unfortunate', 'enough', 'build', 'super', 'Ego', 'case', 'Kingsley', 'character', 'one', 'can', 'sorta', 'continuously', 'keep', 'artificially', 'filling', 'wound', 'ongoing', 'relationships', 'beautiful', 'women', 'Unfortunately', 'only', 'thing', 'will', 'truly', 'fill', 'wound', 'Love', 'sometimes', 'do', ""n't"", 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'love', 'everything', 'else', 'gone.Those', 'points', 'described', 'actually', 'are', 'not', 'well', 'portrayed', 'movie', 'part', 'finding', 'love', 'when', 'else', 'gone', 'point', 'alone', 'movie', 'Kingsley', 'getting', 'old', 'other', 'only', 'sorta', 'friend', 'shares', 'womanizing', 'essentially', 'nothing', 'value', 'life', 'when', 'given', 'beautiful', 'flower', 'behold', 'really', 'idea', 'how', 'handle', 'idea', 'what', 'true', 'love', 'end', 'movie.How', 'many', 'go', 'home', 'alone', 'live', 'out', 'life', 'intimacy', 'do', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'true', 'love', 'is.And', 'do', 'are', 'wounded', 'are', ""n't"", 'good', 'enough', 'Love', 'everything', 'good', 'friendship', 'based', 'knowledge', 'are', 'good', 'enough', 'understanding', 'are', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'will', 'screw', 'up', 'forgiveness', 'responsibility', 'learn', 'mistakes', 'apologize', 'mistakes', 'commitment', 'not', 'feeling', 'write', 'compassion', 'so', 'many', 'do', 'not', 'know']",N/A

Then suddenly, it captured me, and I was entranced.  I realized that this film was a cerebral gift---one that would take me on a journey, opening doors,  that many of us may face one day, during our own life reviews, particularly as WE become 'seniors.'  The issues may be different, but we all share imprefections. No, this was not a shoot-'em-up, car chasing, violent film.  It was a thoughtful, insightful and poignant one.ELEGY left me with many thoughts to ponder, regarding the human psyche: Our often poor choices; how many times we sabotage our happiness; the extensive boundaries we often draw around ourselves; our frequent inability to really see others beyond the surface, and perhaps, even ourselves. How we may snap one day and realize we've lived a life of self-fulfilling, superficiality, while never fully engaging, and that it is suddenly time to pay the consequences. Yes, ELEGY stares these emotions and conflicts (and many more), straight in the eye. And if you don't have tears coming out of yours by the last scenes, as our characters face these demons, you're stronger than I.ELEGY does justice to Philip Roth's erotic novel, THE DYING ANIMAL, which explores sexual indulgence, challenged by aging, and facing the grim-reaper. David Kepsch (Ben Kingsley) is an aging, college professor, and somewhat of a celebrity, who left his wife and son during the 'free sex' era to indulge in serial womanizing and self-absorption. Sadly, it is an era that he never wanted to give up and he begrudges growing old, or becoming that, 'Dying Animal.'  He'd prefer living the, Peter Pan dream, forever, with his now-and-then, sex partner played by Patricia Clarkson and any sexy, young thing, he can lure into his lair, use up, and discard. But in his golden years, they are becoming fewer, and farther, between.In steps the young, Grad student; the gorgeous, erotic, Cuban---Consuelo Castillo (Penelope Cruz).  The chase ensues, but Kepsh begins to suffer severe, narcissistic injury, as his obsession grows and he has to face their 30 year age difference.  Consuelo appears equally infatuated and appears to care less about the age difference. But, instead of embracing his good fortune, Kepsh becomes filled with self doubt, fueled by his best friend (Dennis Hopper). He repeatedly offers terrible advice, except for: 'Don't grow OLD, grow-up,' which was most fitting, although he didn't mean it in the literal terms he should have, being a naughty little enabler, himself.The ending of this movie shows many lessons learned, particularly how the things that worry us most, aren't always the way life plays out; how fleeting and fickle life can be; how true love can re-route our destiny, for the bitter, and, the sweet.This film will not be for everyone.  First off, it is fairly erotic and carries a PG17 rating. And, as previously stated, it is not an action, or mystery film, but a deep character study.  I suspect the younger crowd would not be too interested in the aging protagonist, Kepsh, or much of the theme, although they might like to see the sultry Penelope, sans clothing. That said, it definitely targets a more mature audience.",5,"'Don't grow OLD, grow-up.'",1238457600,"03 31, 2009",2009,3242,"['half', 'hour', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'impressed', 'thought', 'was', 'little', 'slow', 'Then', 'suddenly', 'captured', 'was', 'entranced', 'realized', 'film', 'was', 'cerebral', 'gift', '-one', 'would', 'take', 'journey', 'opening', 'doors', 'many', 'may', 'face', 'one', 'day', 'own', 'life', 'reviews', 'particularly', 'WE', 'become', ""'seniors"", 'issues', 'may', 'be', 'different', 'share', 'imprefections', 'No', 'was', 'not', ""shoot-'em-up"", 'car', 'chasing', 'violent', 'film', 'was', 'thoughtful', 'insightful', 'poignant', 'one.ELEGY', 'left', 'many', 'thoughts', 'ponder', 'regarding', 'human', 'psyche', 'often', 'poor', 'choices', 'how', 'many', 'times', 'sabotage', 'happiness', 'extensive', 'boundaries', 'often', 'draw', 'around', 'ourselves', 'frequent', 'inability', 'really', 'see', 'others', 'surface', 'perhaps', 'even', 'How', 'may', 'snap', 'one', 'day', 'realize', ""'ve"", 'lived', 'life', 'self-fulfilling', 'superficiality', 'never', 'fully', 'engaging', 'suddenly', 'time', 'pay', 'consequences', 'Yes', 'ELEGY', 'emotions', 'conflicts', 'many', 'more', 'straight', 'eye', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'tears', 'coming', 'yours', 'last', 'scenes', 'characters', 'face', 'demons', ""'re"", 'stronger', 'I.ELEGY', 'justice', 'Philip', 'Roth', 'erotic', 'novel', 'THE', 'DYING', 'ANIMAL', 'sexual', 'indulgence', 'challenged', 'aging', 'facing', 'grim-reaper', 'David', 'Kepsch', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'aging', 'college', 'professor', 'somewhat', 'celebrity', 'who', 'left', 'wife', 'son', ""'free"", 'sex', 'era', 'indulge', 'serial', 'womanizing', 'self-absorption', 'Sadly', 'era', 'never', 'wanted', 'give', 'up', 'growing', 'old', 'becoming', ""'Dying"", 'Animal', ""'d"", 'prefer', 'living', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'dream', 'forever', 'now-and-then', 'sex', 'partner', 'played', 'Patricia', 'Clarkson', 'sexy', 'young', 'thing', 'can', 'lure', 'lair', 'use', 'up', 'discard', 'golden', 'years', 'are', 'becoming', 'fewer', 'farther', 'between.In', 'steps', 'young', 'Grad', 'student', 'gorgeous', 'erotic', 'Cuban', '-Consuelo', 'Castillo', 'Penelope', 'Cruz', 'chase', 'Kepsh', 'suffer', 'severe', 'narcissistic', 'injury', 'obsession', 'grows', 'face', '30', 'year', 'age', 'difference', 'Consuelo', 'equally', 'infatuated', 'care', 'less', 'age', 'difference', 'instead', 'embracing', 'good', 'fortune', 'Kepsh', 'filled', 'self', 'doubt', 'fueled', 'best', 'friend', 'Dennis', 'Hopper', 'repeatedly', 'terrible', 'advice', ""'Do"", ""n't"", 'grow', 'OLD', 'grow-up', 'was', 'most', 'fitting', 'did', ""n't"", 'mean', 'literal', 'terms', 'should', 'have', 'being', 'naughty', 'little', 'enabler', 'himself.The', 'ending', 'movie', 'many', 'lessons', 'learned', 'particularly', 'how', 'things', 'worry', 'most', 'are', ""n't"", 'always', 'way', 'life', 'out', 'how', 'fleeting', 'fickle', 'life', 'can', 'be', 'how', 'true', 'love', 'can', 're-route', 'destiny', 'bitter', 'sweet.This', 'film', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'everyone', 'First', 'fairly', 'erotic', 'PG17', 'rating', 'previously', 'stated', 'not', 'action', 'mystery', 'film', 'deep', 'character', 'study', 'suspect', 'younger', 'crowd', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'too', 'interested', 'aging', 'protagonist', 'Kepsh', 'much', 'theme', 'might', 'like', 'see', 'sultry', 'Penelope', 'clothing', 'said', 'definitely', 'more', 'mature', 'audience']",N/A

Kingsley discusses his affair with his best friend George O'Hearn (Dennis Hopper). David continues his relationship with Consuelo for a year, until Consuelo asks him to come to her graduation party. Unable to face her parents, David is a no-show. Consuelo ends the relationship. David misses her. She calls him two years later to say she has breast cancer and is dying.There are some sad truths in this film. As you get older, the people you love die. It makes you feel very mortal. When a lover dies, a version of you goes with them. You face a death of yourself along with the person you loved. Further, when you're dying you think about all the people you used to love and how much you're going to miss them. You'll even miss whatever sad circumstances they brought into your life.Penelope Cruz is stunning and wonderful in the role of Consuelo. I've loved Penelope from way back in the day, when she was playing roles in Pedro Almodovar films likeAll About My Mother. And Ben Kingsley suits his role so well you forget he's acting. My only criticism of the film is that I don't always feel Kepesh's regret. It may be that Kingsley isn't arrogant enough in this role. Besides not being able to face Consuelo's parents and attend her party, he's pretty good to her. He makes plans to take her to Europe. They go everywhere together. He seems to put her through a lot less than a man her age would. If I were dating a woman 30 years younger than me, I'd be scare to meet her parents too. Kepesh doesn't come off as cruel or indifferent to her in the relationship as I think he needed to be. In fact, he seems to really love her. Yes, he has one casual entanglement, but what 60 year old lover isn't going to have some baggage?Roth loves to explore relationships of the older man with the slightly inappropriate younger woman as he did inThe Human Stain: A Novel. But Elegy is much more than a May/December romance. It's a touching tribute to a lover that is missed.

This superb production is as close to perfection as a film can get.  The editing, cinematography, and scriptwriting all exhibit supreme levels of excellence, but it is the acting of Penelope Cruz, Sir Ben Kingsley and Dennis Hopper under the guidance of Spanish director, Isabel Coixet, that ensure the enduring importance of this film. It begins with Sir Ben's character, David Kepesh, a celebrity social historian, being interviewed by the acclaimed Charlie Rose about the trumping of sexual freedom in the early days of the American colony.  That tells us right off the bat where his interests lie.  He is a man deeply committed to the aesthetic, who has made a habit of seducing beautiful young coeds when the opportunity presents itself, and falling back on his rainy day woman, played by Patricia Clarkson.  It is, he confesses later, a form of arrested development, where he and the character played by Denis Hopper lived the whole of their lives as teenagers, incapable of receiving real love when it presented itself.  Then enter Penelope Cruz in the guise of Cuban student, Consuela Castillo, a beautiful, exotic, and intelligent woman 30 years his junior, who falls for him.  It's the real thing for him, too, but his inability to commit, exacerbated by his fear of aging and an expectation that she will eventually drop him for a handsome, potent young man of her vintage just about wrecks it for him.  The d&eacute;nouement is very moving.  I won't spoil it, but make sure you have a box of tissues at the ready.  The pace and intelligence of this film reminded me of Canadian director Denys Arcand's work (""Invasion of the Barbarians"").  This must surely be Penelope Cruz's greatest film performance, and Sir Ben?  Well, what can one say that hasn't been said about this extraordinary actor?  The intimate moments between he and Penelope Cruz are truly memorable.

1184864,A91YY4W9MB3R9,B001E95ZFG,"T. Rosa ""celluloid526""","[2, 3]","There is so much to be said about this film.  What comes immediately to mind is how much it says with so little dialogue.  ""Arguably"" this can be attributed to the great direction, cinematography, writing and acting all found within the 112 or so minutes of the film. An elegy is a poem that is written for someone who is dead and yet the only person who dies in this movie never really dies.  Perhaps the elegy is for the lifeless person within David Kepesh that has to die so that he can finally live. I guess the title Elegy beats Dying Animals, the title of the book the story is adapted from, written by Philip Roth.Sir Ben Kingsley is one of my favorite actors.  In his role as Professor David Kepesh he delivers a truly believable character as the older intellect that has spent a great deal of his post-divorced life avoiding the permanence of ""relationships"" and all of its nasty and complicated ""entanglements"".  As a consequence he has also lost the best that love and all of its complications can often bring to a life. Kepesh crosses paths with a young student Consuela Castillo... translated her name literally means ""consolation"" which could very well be what her role is in Kepesh's life...what he thinks will be an easy conquest for him to accomplish ends up being something totally different and unexpected. Ah, life!As a fairly attractive and interesting professor, Kepesh seduces his way through women with his intellect and suave explanation of the literature, art and music he surrounds himself with. He is arrogant and believes that when the tryst between them is over he will have left them more cultured in exchange for their new understanding of what it is like to be with an older man. For such a ""cultured"" man he is rather uncultured.Early in the movie, he makes a very profound statement about books. Paraphrased...he basically states that if you read it [a book] today it will mean one thing but if you go back and read the same book years later it will mean something different because a book is relevant to the moment it is being read and is just a book until someone reads it and defines what it means. It can change over and over again. I think the same is true for people.  We are just who we are until someone comes along and affects, inspires, motivates, forces, and compels us into who we become...for that time in our lives. We can change over and over again.Ben Kingsley is great but you need someone or something to bring out that intensity; in this ""someone"", came my greatest surprise and pleasure. Enter Consuela Castillo; a student and an object of desire for the professor.  Much like the professor, I didn't expect to fall in love with the character Consuela Castillo, beautifully and believably performed by Penelope Cruz. [Ms. Cruz is getting so much better at leaving her desire to speak English without an accent and is now just delivering the goods. I am a fan.]I appreciate the way Cruz uses her eyes to speak and her facial expressions and body language say so much for Consulea with so few words. You feel what she is feeling whether it is annoyance for the professor's possessiveness or the look of true desire that we can read with the flair of her nostril and the arching of her back in response to his overtures.  You've seen her in other movies where she is very capable of delivering the intent of the character and the moment. She does so in this film with great tenderness and is deliberate in just how much she holds back, leaving you, the audience wanting more of her. So who is the real seducer? What makes her different from all the rest and how did she manage to change the paradigm so drastically? You tell me.Any way the story is about the alchemy of these two elements. Even when they are lying they are honest. Each of the characters in this story all have much needed and essential roles to play. They hang like a perfectly hinged door opening and closing letting you go in and out of what is happening in the story and feeling it all quite easily without having to give it much thought.  There is nothing gratuitous about this story or any of the characters we get to see and meet.  What I get from this movie is that life is what happens whether or not you are awake.  Living is what you do to make the moments matter. The discoveries along the way are the difference between living and just merely existing. In this story we get to see the continuum disturbed and what would appear to be a stable life, get rattled to its core.  That is life. It's all quite beautiful.There is so much more.

1184865,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B001E95ZFG,Turfseer,"[5, 9]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***Why won't they learn? I'll say it over and over: sad sacks do not make for good drama. And Ben Kingsley's David Kepesh is the ultimate sad sack. Virtually everything about him is negative: his terrible relationship with his son stemming from his decision to leave his wife years ago; a 20 year old relationship with a woman that he routinely has sex with but can't get intimate with; a penchant for lying; low esteem and worst of all--inability to commit.We're first introduced to Kepesh as he's interviewed by Charlie Rose. We find out that he's a older professor whose had some success as a cultural critic. There's some literary talk sprinkled throughout the film that at first seduces the film-goer into believing that this might be some kind of brooding intellectual psychodrama a la Ingmar Bergman. Alas it is not! What it's really about is a character whom we can care little about--precisely because he's such a wuss.Kepesh's wussiness is manifested in his obsession with Penelope Cruz's Consuela Castillo. Her character, by the way, is even less developed then the aging, self-absorbed professor. Basically, she's Kepesh's love object; anything distinctive about her personality does not appear to be reflected in the Elegy screenplay. What's worse is her motivation for falling for creepy Kepesh. Is it simply because he's an older guy? Given his constant dour mood, I fail to see why she would be attracted to Kepesh. All kinds of red flags would have went up for Consula the second Kepesh shows up at the club, obviously jealous and trying to spy on her. And he lies to her about why he showed up to boot. That's the sign of a loser--a blatant wuss, so where was Consuela's wuss detector'?--obviously turned off until she ultimately sees the light. But would a normal woman cut a guy like Kepesh so much slack, and for so long? I think not!I found it painful to watch the scenes where Kepesh and his oncologist son go toe to toe. The son is as much as a sad sack as the father--he's positively guilt ridden over his own infidelity. Why are virtually all the characters in the film so full of angst? How about a character who actually enjoys the affair he's having? You'll notice there's absolutely no humor in this film whatsoever--a sign that the director and her creative team takes themselves a little too seriously.After plodding along for so long, we come to the manipulative plot twist at the climax. Wouldn't you know it but our nondescript Consuela now has cancer! Where are all those wonderful family members who showed up at her graduation party?--the one that Kepesh bailed out on. Now only the cowardly Kepesh is there for her.But you see we soon learn that Kepesh isn't such an emotional basket case as we were led to believe after all! He actually cries when he finds out Counsela is ill and does everything he can to comfort her during her last days on this earth. In my view, Kepesh's 'redemption' comes a little too late in the game. By the time he cradles the dying Consuela, I've already written him off as a die-hard misanthrope!Elegy is not without a few bright spots. The late Dennis Hopper does well as Kepesh's former Pulitzer Prize winning buddy, George O'Hearn, who correctly predicts that his relationship with Counsela is going nowhere. And Patricia Clarkson as Carolyn, Kepesh's long-term mistress, manages to convey some world-weary wisdom.Kudos to director Isabel Coixet for the excellent cinematography--one of the DVD bonus features reveals that Coixet shot many scenes herself in conjunction with her director of photography. There are also interviews with the principal actors who sing the praises of the film to high heaven. Despite the beautiful look to the film, I lose faith every time I see a film where the actors truly believe they're creating something profound but in reality are peddling nothing more than abject pretentiousness masquerading as an aesthetic masterpiece.",2,Misanthropic Professor's 'redemption' comes a little too late in the game,1283472000,"09 3, 2010",2010,3967,"['***', 'review', 'may', 'contain', 'spoilers', '***Why', 'wo', ""n't"", 'learn', ""'ll"", 'say', 'over', 'sad', 'sacks', 'do', 'not', 'make', 'good', 'drama', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'David', 'Kepesh', 'ultimate', 'sad', 'sack', 'Virtually', 'everything', 'negative', 'terrible', 'relationship', 'son', 'stemming', 'decision', 'leave', 'wife', 'years', 'ago', '20', 'year', 'old', 'relationship', 'woman', 'routinely', 'sex', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'intimate', 'penchant', 'lying', 'low', 'esteem', 'worst', 'inability', 'commit.We', ""'re"", 'first', 'introduced', 'Kepesh', 'interviewed', 'Charlie', 'Rose', 'find', 'out', 'older', 'professor', 'had', 'success', 'cultural', 'critic', 'literary', 'talk', 'sprinkled', 'film', 'first', 'seduces', 'film-goer', 'believing', 'might', 'be', 'kind', 'brooding', 'intellectual', 'psychodrama', 'la', 'Ingmar', 'Bergman', 'Alas', 'not', 'What', 'really', 'about', 'character', 'whom', 'can', 'care', 'little', 'precisely', 'such', 'wuss.Kepesh', 'wussiness', 'manifested', 'obsession', 'Penelope', 'Cruz', 'Consuela', 'Castillo', 'character', 'way', 'even', 'less', 'developed', 'then', 'aging', 'self-absorbed', 'professor', 'Basically', 'Kepesh', 'love', 'object', 'anything', 'distinctive', 'personality', 'not', 'appear', 'be', 'reflected', 'Elegy', 'screenplay', 'What', 'worse', 'motivation', 'falling', 'creepy', 'Kepesh', 'simply', 'older', 'guy', 'Given', 'constant', 'dour', 'mood', 'fail', 'see', 'why', 'would', 'be', 'attracted', 'Kepesh', 'kinds', 'red', 'flags', 'would', 'have', 'went', 'up', 'Consula', 'second', 'Kepesh', 'up', 'club', 'obviously', 'jealous', 'trying', 'spy', 'about', 'why', 'showed', 'up', 'boot', 'sign', 'loser', 'blatant', 'wuss', 'so', 'where', 'was', 'Consuela', 'wuss', 'detector', 'obviously', 'turned', 'off', 'ultimately', 'light', 'would', 'normal', 'woman', 'cut', 'guy', 'Kepesh', 'so', 'much', 'slack', 'so', 'long', 'think', 'not', 'found', 'painful', 'watch', 'scenes', 'where', 'Kepesh', 'oncologist', 'son', 'go', 'toe', 'toe', 'son', 'as', 'much', 'sad', 'sack', 'father', 'positively', 'guilt', 'ridden', 'own', 'infidelity', 'Why', 'are', 'virtually', 'characters', 'film', 'so', 'full', 'angst', 'How', 'character', 'who', 'actually', 'affair', 'having', ""'ll"", 'notice', 'absolutely', 'humor', 'film', 'whatsoever', 'sign', 'director', 'creative', 'team', 'little', 'too', 'seriously.After', 'plodding', 'along', 'so', 'long', 'come', 'manipulative', 'plot', 'twist', 'climax', 'Would', ""n't"", 'know', 'nondescript', 'Consuela', 'now', 'cancer', 'Where', 'are', 'wonderful', 'family', 'members', 'who', 'showed', 'up', 'graduation', 'party', 'one', 'Kepesh', 'bailed', 'out', 'Now', 'only', 'cowardly', 'Kepesh', 'there', 'her.But', 'see', 'soon', 'learn', 'Kepesh', ""n't"", 'such', 'emotional', 'basket', 'case', 'were', 'led', 'believe', 'actually', 'when', 'out', 'Counsela', 'ill', 'everything', 'can', 'comfort', 'last', 'days', 'earth', 'view', 'Kepesh', ""'redemption"", 'little', 'too', 'late', 'game', 'time', 'dying', 'Consuela', ""'ve"", 'already', 'written', 'off', 'die-hard', 'misanthrope', 'Elegy', 'not', 'few', 'bright', 'spots', 'late', 'Dennis', 'Hopper', 'well', 'Kepesh', 'former', 'Pulitzer', 'Prize', 'winning', 'buddy', 'George', ""O'Hearn"", 'who', 'correctly', 'relationship', 'Counsela', 'going', 'nowhere', 'Patricia', 'Clarkson', 'Carolyn', 'Kepesh', 'long-term', 'mistress', 'convey', 'world-weary', 'wisdom.Kudos', 'director', 'Isabel', 'Coixet', 'excellent', 'cinematography', 'one', 'DVD', 'bonus', 'features', 'reveals', 'Coixet', 'shot', 'many', 'scenes', 'conjunction', 'director', 'photography', 'are', 'also', 'interviews', 'principal', 'actors', 'who', 'sing', 'praises', 'film', 'high', 'heaven', 'beautiful', 'look', 'film', 'lose', 'faith', 'time', 'see', 'film', 'where', 'actors', 'truly', 'believe', ""'re"", 'creating', 'something', 'profound', 'reality', 'are', 'peddling', 'nothing', 'more', 'abject', 'pretentiousness', 'masquerading', 'aesthetic', 'masterpiece']",N/A
1184866,A26PXKLBB29GH1,B001E95ZFG,victrola,"[0, 0]","I first saw parts of this film on HBO one night when I was traveling on business.I admire Ben Kingsley's acting (for the most part) and Penelope Cruz is so lovely I was curious and decided to give it a try and ended up purchasing the DVD online.As several other reviewers have mentioned here, Ben Kingsley plays a sort of intellectual cad praying on his young students for sexual satisfaction to feed his ego.  This time he hits the jackpot and has Penelope Cruz by day and Patricia Clarkson as the older business woman every third week for a sleepover. I don't  know, his obsession with her breasts and her looks just made me uncomfortable and to feel for her character. You get the feeling he would tire of her once she got older and start having the affiars with his students again.He never intends to fall in love with Cruz's character, (but he does) and then his lack of maturity hastens the end of their affair.Several years later he receives a call from her (New Year's Eve) and she comes over to his apartment to tell him she has breast cancer. This is where I lost interest because the film became to depressing, and was depressing to begin with.Still I must say I watch this film over again when I want to be depressed.",4,Bittersweet Romance,1344211200,"08 6, 2012",2012,1229,"['first', 'saw', 'parts', 'film', 'HBO', 'one', 'night', 'when', 'was', 'traveling', 'business.I', 'admire', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'acting', 'most', 'part', 'Penelope', 'Cruz', 'so', 'lovely', 'was', 'curious', 'decided', 'give', 'try', 'ended', 'up', 'purchasing', 'DVD', 'online.As', 'several', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'mentioned', 'here', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'sort', 'intellectual', 'cad', 'praying', 'young', 'students', 'sexual', 'satisfaction', 'feed', 'ego', 'time', 'jackpot', 'Penelope', 'Cruz', 'day', 'Patricia', 'Clarkson', 'older', 'business', 'woman', 'third', 'week', 'sleepover', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'obsession', 'breasts', 'looks', 'just', 'made', 'uncomfortable', 'feel', 'character', 'get', 'feeling', 'would', 'tire', 'once', 'got', 'older', 'start', 'having', 'affiars', 'students', 'again.He', 'never', 'fall', 'love', 'Cruz', 'character', 'then', 'lack', 'maturity', 'end', 'affair.Several', 'years', 'later', 'call', 'New', 'Year', 'Eve', 'apartment', 'tell', 'breast', 'cancer', 'where', 'lost', 'interest', 'film', 'became', 'depressing', 'was', 'depressing', 'begin', 'with.Still', 'must', 'say', 'watch', 'film', 'over', 'again', 'when', 'want', 'be', 'depressed']",N/A
