1265891,A2E1EFNIZL2FVA,B002EZLQ0W,&#9899;   RIZZO   &#9899;,"[4, 6]","Director and Writer So Yong Kim has drawn from some of her memories growing up in Korea.  The 2008 Korean film tells the story of two little girls, 4 and 6, who with resilence and tenacity manage abandonment and without understanding how traumatic abandonment and a mother's betrayal can be.The film is not told, but it is a a view through the eyes and soul of two young girls who are left by their mother who told the girls she needed to find their father.  They are pushed off on an uncaring alcoholic aunt and then shuttled again.What is important about this film is that it isn't the experience of adults, as the role of adults is minimal.  The experience is raw and directly from the young girls, what they see, what they hear, what they feel, and their determination to get back with their mother.What you see is images of children, making their way in an adult world.  The film takes place in the congested streets of Seoul to the rural countryside.  One of the most poignant scenes is where they stand tall trying to get a glimpse of their mother as she boards a bus, not to come back for them.  Many people will identify with these two girls, shuffled around, abandoned.  The film may appear to move slow at times, but it is critical to the pace of their desertion.  .....Rizzo",5,Betrayal and abandonment,1253404800,"09 20, 2009",2009,1286,"['Director', 'Writer', 'So', 'Yong', 'Kim', 'drawn', 'memories', 'growing', 'up', 'Korea', '2008', 'Korean', 'film', 'story', 'two', 'little', 'girls', '4', '6', 'who', 'resilence', 'tenacity', 'manage', 'abandonment', 'understanding', 'how', 'traumatic', 'abandonment', 'mother', 'betrayal', 'can', 'be.The', 'film', 'not', 'told', 'view', 'eyes', 'soul', 'two', 'young', 'girls', 'who', 'are', 'left', 'mother', 'who', 'told', 'girls', 'needed', 'find', 'father', 'are', 'pushed', 'off', 'uncaring', 'alcoholic', 'aunt', 'then', 'shuttled', 'important', 'film', ""n't"", 'experience', 'adults', 'role', 'adults', 'minimal', 'experience', 'raw', 'directly', 'young', 'girls', 'what', 'see', 'what', 'hear', 'what', 'feel', 'determination', 'get', 'back', 'mother.What', 'see', 'images', 'children', 'making', 'way', 'adult', 'world', 'film', 'place', 'congested', 'streets', 'Seoul', 'rural', 'countryside', 'One', 'most', 'poignant', 'scenes', 'where', 'stand', 'tall', 'trying', 'get', 'glimpse', 'mother', 'bus', 'not', 'come', 'back', 'Many', 'people', 'will', 'identify', 'two', 'girls', 'shuffled', 'abandoned', 'film', 'may', 'appear', 'move', 'slow', 'times', 'critical', 'pace', 'desertion', '..Rizzo']",N/A
1265892,A3BOGELRQJK8OE,B002EZLQ0W,a gentle sound,"[1, 1]","One of the few Korean words I know is Halmoni, from a story I read with third graders when I taught it. (totally off topic I am transferring back to 3rd, looking forward to the story once again)Interestingly I learned a few more Korean words from this film I caught today on Sundance.Bin and Jin are very like two children that I might be teaching, caught in financial collapse as their mother drops them on her sister, Big Aunt, an alcoholic who goes on and fails them as well. Mom is caught in a deceit telling them she'll be back when they fill a small piggy bank.  The film really introduces us into this time of crisis for these kids.  They are so darling- they do amazingly filling their bank to try to get Mom home through utter ingenuity. Coin exchanging, as well as solid entrepreneurial creativity. But in doing so, they learn she is ""a liar."" (Things trigger memories, this reminded me of one of my own-a promise unkept about the taking of a family to San Diego for a vacation for which I saved for years-but a divorce was really what I got when the bank had the amount I was required to save from money I never used for shoes and clothing.) In the movies near end in a key scene the older sister takes the bank to her grandmother as she has realized her grandmother has awful shoes, after asking her for winter shoes for them both-and then understanding Halmoni has terrible shoes. I saw this as the child gaining empathy capacity. And in that moment I felt the film suggested that from our struggles comes our capacity to see and care for others-the real genius in the work.....Along the way in quiet scenes we glimpse the world from the child's space. It is poetic. Just scenes like a long shot on a cloud are embedded with implication, feeling.  Big Aunt takes them to their grandparents who live in a very rural, simplistic, yet oddly comforting and real way. I found that the happy ending actually, that they found a way to family, support, care.I started to think about why I kept watching. The children were beautiful. They played like children play, they related like children relate. The wordlessness and the feelings of children in events such as this was conveyed. I teach 6 year olds. One child had a crisis, he took a lollipop from another. But in unwinding this this child one of 5 siblings in a broken family in troubled times, with different absent fathers told his mother to call me that afternoon and she did.  Slowly and in such a puzzle piece kind of way of communication I learned she was a week in a hospital, still there, about to lose her baby, with 107 fever, had been iced, so on. He was dealing with all of this in a wordless vacuum. All I saw was a stolen pop and a boy that looked unfeeling. But surely is not. He's actually deeply wanting to do well. Understand, communicate his meanings. I think the movie conveys something of this child-iverse a place where things just happen, and you are wrapped in the realities in the moment. And aren't able to formulate a verbal narrative. In this way, how it was shot, the piece is brilliant.It's a very moving film but it ends in a way that left me feeling I'd still like to go along with the girls watching time pass.Teach them a song or two, be their teacher. I know we would enjoy our time together.",5,"Roots, Leaves, Branches, Trunk, Families",1303603200,"04 24, 2011",2011,3287,"['One', 'few', 'Korean', 'words', 'know', 'Halmoni', 'story', 'read', 'third', 'graders', 'when', 'taught', 'totally', 'topic', 'am', 'transferring', 'back', '3rd', 'looking', 'forward', 'story', 'once', 'again', 'Interestingly', 'learned', 'few', 'more', 'Korean', 'words', 'film', 'caught', 'today', 'Sundance.Bin', 'Jin', 'are', 'very', 'two', 'children', 'might', 'be', 'teaching', 'caught', 'financial', 'collapse', 'mother', 'sister', 'Big', 'Aunt', 'alcoholic', 'who', 'fails', 'as', 'well', 'Mom', 'caught', 'deceit', 'telling', ""'ll"", 'be', 'back', 'when', 'fill', 'small', 'piggy', 'bank', 'film', 'really', 'time', 'crisis', 'kids', 'are', 'so', 'darling-', 'do', 'amazingly', 'filling', 'bank', 'try', 'get', 'Mom', 'home', 'utter', 'ingenuity', 'Coin', 'exchanging', 'as', 'well', 'solid', 'entrepreneurial', 'creativity', 'doing', 'so', 'learn', 'liar', 'Things', 'trigger', 'memories', 'reminded', 'one', 'own-a', 'promise', 'unkept', 'taking', 'family', 'San', 'Diego', 'vacation', 'saved', 'years-but', 'divorce', 'was', 'really', 'what', 'got', 'when', 'bank', 'had', 'amount', 'was', 'required', 'save', 'money', 'never', 'used', 'shoes', 'clothing', 'movies', 'end', 'key', 'scene', 'older', 'sister', 'bank', 'grandmother', 'realized', 'grandmother', 'awful', 'shoes', 'asking', 'winter', 'shoes', 'both-and', 'then', 'understanding', 'Halmoni', 'terrible', 'shoes', 'saw', 'child', 'gaining', 'empathy', 'capacity', 'moment', 'felt', 'film', 'suggested', 'struggles', 'capacity', 'see', 'care', 'others-the', 'real', 'genius', 'work', '..Along', 'way', 'quiet', 'scenes', 'glimpse', 'world', 'child', 'space', 'poetic', 'Just', 'scenes', 'long', 'shot', 'cloud', 'are', 'embedded', 'implication', 'feeling', 'Big', 'Aunt', 'grandparents', 'who', 'live', 'very', 'rural', 'simplistic', 'yet', 'oddly', 'comforting', 'real', 'way', 'found', 'happy', 'ending', 'actually', 'found', 'way', 'family', 'support', 'care.I', 'started', 'think', 'why', 'kept', 'watching', 'children', 'were', 'beautiful', 'played', 'children', 'play', 'related', 'children', 'relate', 'wordlessness', 'feelings', 'children', 'events', 'such', 'was', 'conveyed', 'teach', '6', 'year', 'olds', 'One', 'child', 'had', 'crisis', 'took', 'lollipop', 'unwinding', 'one', '5', 'siblings', 'broken', 'family', 'troubled', 'times', 'different', 'absent', 'fathers', 'told', 'mother', 'call', 'afternoon', 'did', 'Slowly', 'such', 'puzzle', 'piece', 'kind', 'way', 'communication', 'learned', 'was', 'week', 'hospital', 'still', 'there', 'lose', 'baby', '107', 'fever', 'had', 'been', 'iced', 'so', 'was', 'dealing', 'wordless', 'vacuum', 'saw', 'was', 'stolen', 'pop', 'boy', 'looked', 'unfeeling', 'surely', 'not', 'actually', 'deeply', 'wanting', 'do', 'well', 'Understand', 'communicate', 'meanings', 'think', 'movie', 'conveys', 'something', 'child-iverse', 'place', 'where', 'things', 'just', 'happen', 'are', 'wrapped', 'realities', 'moment', 'are', ""n't"", 'able', 'formulate', 'verbal', 'narrative', 'way', 'how', 'was', 'shot', 'piece', 'brilliant.It', 'very', 'moving', 'film', 'way', 'left', 'feeling', ""'d"", 'still', 'like', 'go', 'along', 'girls', 'watching', 'time', 'pass.Teach', 'song', 'two', 'be', 'teacher', 'know', 'would', 'enjoy', 'time', 'together']",N/A

1265897,A3MNJL4ROH6LRW,B002EZLQ0W,Don R. Holloway,"[1, 1]","""Treeless Mountain"" is a beautiful and emotionally affecting film. In the film, two young girls are left in the care of an uncaring aunt so that the mother can supposedly go look for her estranged husband. She tells the girls she will return before too long, but it soon becomes clear (through a letter to the aunt) that she simply is unable to care for the children any more. So the aunt, on the advice of the mother, takes the children to their grandparents farm to stay. The children develop a close bond to the kind grandmother and they start to feel comfortable in their surroundings.The two children, who had never acted before, gave incredibly beautiful performances. Six-year-old Hee Yeon Kim played the role of Jin while four-year-old Song Hee Kim played her younger sister Bin. I found it so easy to fall in love with these two beautiful children. They performed with such a naturalness and softness that they seemed like real sisters. The chemistry was so strong between them. And So Young Kim did a remarkable job as writer and director of the film. Her style of direction put all the focus on the two girls and their circumstances. And even though times were sometimes difficult for the girls, there is such a soft and delicate air about the film. I think ""Treeless Mountain"" is one of the best films about childhood ever made. And it does such a good job of showing the resilience that children have in adapting to difficult situations. I would give this film more than 5 stars if I could; it's really that good. And I would certainly recommend it to anyone.",5,The Resilience of Children,1330819200,"03 4, 2012",2012,1572,"['Treeless', 'Mountain', 'beautiful', 'emotionally', 'affecting', 'film', 'film', 'two', 'young', 'girls', 'are', 'left', 'care', 'uncaring', 'aunt', 'so', 'mother', 'can', 'supposedly', 'go', 'look', 'estranged', 'husband', 'girls', 'will', 'return', 'too', 'long', 'soon', 'clear', 'letter', 'aunt', 'simply', 'unable', 'care', 'children', 'more', 'aunt', 'advice', 'mother', 'children', 'grandparents', 'farm', 'stay', 'children', 'develop', 'close', 'bond', 'kind', 'grandmother', 'start', 'feel', 'comfortable', 'surroundings.The', 'two', 'children', 'who', 'had', 'never', 'acted', 'gave', 'incredibly', 'beautiful', 'performances', 'Six-year-old', 'Hee', 'Yeon', 'Kim', 'played', 'role', 'Jin', 'four-year-old', 'Song', 'Hee', 'Kim', 'played', 'younger', 'sister', 'Bin', 'found', 'so', 'easy', 'fall', 'love', 'two', 'beautiful', 'children', 'performed', 'naturalness', 'softness', 'seemed', 'real', 'sisters', 'chemistry', 'was', 'so', 'strong', 'So', 'Young', 'Kim', 'did', 'remarkable', 'job', 'writer', 'director', 'film', 'style', 'direction', 'put', 'focus', 'two', 'girls', 'circumstances', 'even', 'times', 'were', 'sometimes', 'difficult', 'girls', 'such', 'soft', 'delicate', 'air', 'film', 'think', 'Treeless', 'Mountain', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'childhood', 'ever', 'made', 'good', 'job', 'showing', 'resilience', 'children', 'have', 'adapting', 'difficult', 'situations', 'would', 'give', 'film', 'more', '5', 'stars', 'could', 'really', 'good', 'would', 'certainly', 'recommend', 'anyone']",N/A
1265898,A1RMWCN45F0PF9,B002EZLQ0W,"J. A. Eyon ""Little Raven""","[2, 2]","Disney would have turned a movie of this premise into an adventure. Writer/director Kim So Yong wanted something more realistic. The result isn't a film for everyone. It's not for people who need dramatic arcs to propel them thru a film. This one tries to avoid anything formulaic like a plot. (It doesn't quite succeed at that. There are moments that feel like dramatic construction.) But it avoids paroxysms and moves at naturalistic pace. Overall, it feels like a series of glimpses of real life.The film focuses on the bewilderment of two children and that no doubt springs from the Kim So Yong's own experience of being left in the care of her grandparents on a farm as her divorced mother went to the US to build a life for her and her children. (Kim So Yong would emigrate to the US at age 12.) In the movie, the mother instead hunts for her husband. Her motive is only implied - it is clear that she needs financial help to care for her two daughters - and perhaps more.The film strives for and achieves a constant oppressive mood of abandonment. This is enforced by the use of muted lighting and color and the use of mostly hand-held closeups of the girls. The closeups give the movie a strongly personal tone, as if seeing and feeling the children's innermost thoughts. But it's also claustrophobic and the few establishing shots feel like respites.The child actresses are a delight and -- while not quite natural in front of the camera -- So Yong keeps them convincing enuf. The two trained actresses who play the mother and the aunt are very good. But it's the appeal of the two girls (the youngest in a princess gown) that carries the film.A lot of credit must also go to Anne Misawa's carmerawork and the ability to make visuals that seem artless altho they really are finely crafted. The now-iconic scene of the two girls standing atop a mound of dirt (the treeless mountain?) is just one example to be found in the movie.I don't know if it was deliberate, but there seems to be a message here about city life versus rural life in the nurturing of children. I'd be surprised if it was deliberate. I think Kim So Yong was more interested in the idea of parents abandoning children for however long and whatever reason -- and to say ""don't do that"". And the best way to do say that was to bring out the reality of the situation -- rather than using the Disney approach.",4,Don't expect Disney,1277856000,"06 30, 2010",2010,2382,"['Disney', 'would', 'have', 'turned', 'movie', 'premise', 'adventure', 'Writer/director', 'Kim', 'So', 'Yong', 'wanted', 'something', 'more', 'realistic', 'result', ""n't"", 'film', 'everyone', 'not', 'people', 'who', 'need', 'dramatic', 'arcs', 'propel', 'thru', 'film', 'one', 'avoid', 'anything', 'formulaic', 'plot', ""n't"", 'quite', 'succeed', 'are', 'moments', 'feel', 'dramatic', 'construction', 'paroxysms', 'moves', 'naturalistic', 'pace', 'Overall', 'series', 'glimpses', 'real', 'life.The', 'film', 'bewilderment', 'two', 'children', 'doubt', 'springs', 'Kim', 'So', 'Yong', 'own', 'experience', 'being', 'left', 'care', 'grandparents', 'farm', 'divorced', 'mother', 'went', 'US', 'build', 'life', 'children', 'Kim', 'So', 'Yong', 'would', 'emigrate', 'US', 'age', '12', 'movie', 'mother', 'instead', 'hunts', 'husband', 'motive', 'only', 'implied', 'clear', 'financial', 'help', 'care', 'two', 'daughters', 'perhaps', 'more.The', 'film', 'strives', 'constant', 'oppressive', 'mood', 'abandonment', 'enforced', 'use', 'muted', 'lighting', 'color', 'use', 'mostly', 'hand-held', 'closeups', 'girls', 'closeups', 'give', 'movie', 'strongly', 'personal', 'tone', 'seeing', 'feeling', 'children', 'innermost', 'thoughts', 'also', 'claustrophobic', 'few', 'establishing', 'shots', 'feel', 'respites.The', 'child', 'actresses', 'are', 'delight', 'not', 'quite', 'natural', 'front', 'camera', 'So', 'Yong', 'keeps', 'convincing', 'enuf', 'two', 'trained', 'actresses', 'who', 'play', 'mother', 'aunt', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'appeal', 'two', 'girls', 'youngest', 'princess', 'gown', 'film.A', 'lot', 'credit', 'must', 'also', 'go', 'Anne', 'Misawa', 'carmerawork', 'ability', 'make', 'visuals', 'seem', 'artless', 'really', 'are', 'finely', 'crafted', 'now-iconic', 'scene', 'two', 'girls', 'standing', 'mound', 'dirt', 'treeless', 'mountain', 'just', 'one', 'example', 'be', 'found', 'movie.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'was', 'deliberate', 'there', 'be', 'message', 'here', 'city', 'life', 'rural', 'life', 'nurturing', 'children', ""'d"", 'be', 'surprised', 'was', 'deliberate', 'think', 'Kim', 'So', 'Yong', 'was', 'more', 'interested', 'idea', 'parents', 'abandoning', 'children', 'however', 'long', 'reason', 'say', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'best', 'way', 'do', 'say', 'was', 'bring', 'out', 'reality', 'situation', 'rather', 'using', 'Disney', 'approach']",N/A
1265899,AFHYEO3Y1IIDD,B002EZLQ0W,maximum verbosity,"[2, 2]","Treeless Mountain loosely reflects the personal experiences of writer-director So Yong Kim who grew up in South Korea and immigrated to the U.S. when she was twelve years old. It is a meticulously observed portrait of two Korean girls, ages 5 and 7, coping with the terrors of having to rely mostly on their own resources when their mother leaves to search for their estranged father. Like Kelly Reichardt's minimalist Wendy and Lucy, not much happens in the way of plot but the film is less about what happens externally than internally - in the character's tentative groping toward maturity.Kim's camera is always close to the girls' faces, allowing us to see the world through their eyes. It is still an innocent world but one that is becoming more knowing and, unfortunately, more acclimatized to the lies of adults. When seven-year-old Jin (Hee Yeon Kim) and her younger sister Bin (Song Hee Kim) are left by their mother (Soo Ah Lee) in the care of an alcoholic aunt (Mi Hyang Kim), she gives them a piggy bank and tells them that each time they listen to ""Big Aunt"", a coin will be deposited in their bank. When it is filled, she will return. Big Aunt is cold and cranky and clearly cannot handle the responsibility of caring for the young girls but is more annoying than abusive, calling them a ""pain"" to be around and berating young Bin for bed wetting.In one scene, Jin, the oldest girl wakes up to find she has wet the bed.  When questioned, Jin tells Big Aunt that her little sister, Bin, wet the bed.  Big Aunt becomes very angry and punishes the girls by giving Bin a bowl and making her wear a bamboo cape and tells them to beg the neighbors for salt.  This is an old-school Korean form of punishment designed to humiliate and shame a bedwetter (maybe not practiced in big cities but in small villages and rural areas). In another, she demands money from a neighbor for a minor scratch Bin suffers when playing with her son. Bin and Jin manage to find friendship, however, with a little handicapped boy and pass the time by capturing and roasting grasshoppers to sell on the streets to help fill their piggy bank. When they discover that they can exchange one large coin for many small ones, they are one step closer to what they believe will be their mother's return. When the bank is filled, the girls wait for their mother at the bus stop, losing faith with each bus that comes and goes without their mother. It is a heartbreaking scene that brings back memories of classic neorealist films of the past.Optimism and inner strength surface again, however, when, after receiving a letter from the girls' mother, Big Aunt delivers them to their grandparents farm in the countryside. In their return to nature, they can at last breathe free and open themselves to the caring they so desperately need. Recruited through the director's observations of children at local Korean schools rather than through talent agencies, the performances of Hee Yeon Kim and Song Hee Kim are models of authenticity.There is never any sense that they are simply acting or going through the motions, these little girls are AMAZING and the story of how those little actors were chosen is a story in itself.

Promised by their mother that if they were good their aunt would give them coins and that she would come back when their piggy bank was full, the children improvise ways to earn small change and fill up the bank, hoping to hasten their mother's return.So Yong Kim's follow up to the wonderful and understatedIn Between Daysis a revelation of a film.  Shot in a style that captures simple nuances of childhood without artifice, the film is also a formal masterpiece.  Every shot is framed with care and precision, captures subtleties of gesture and emotion that feel utterly authentic, or captures settings and light and other natural elements to give a haiku-like accent to the mood of surrounding scenes.  To say that this film is shot documentary-style is technically true, but may give the false impression of a amateur home-movie style video or shaky cameras and this film is nothing like that.  In its formal precision that captures the essence of the reality it depicts rather than the raw subject matter the film is closer to work by the Dardenne Brothers or to that of Robert Bresson, than to the more ad hoc and improvised ""documentary-style"" cinematography of the Office television series or of something like Cloverfield or even District 9.A delicate and lovely film about the fragility and resilience of childhood.

1265901,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B002EZLQ0W,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[0, 2]","&lt;strong>Treeless Mountain&lt;/strong> (So-yong Kim, 2008)Not long ago I reviewed a failed-potential coming-of-age film called &lt;em>Trees Grow Tall and Then They Fall&lt;/em> (q.v.). It has a number of thing in common with &lt;em>Treeless Mountain&lt;/em> beyond the titles making reference to trees. In many places where the former film gets things wrong, &lt;em>Treeless Mountain&lt;/em> gets things right, and yet for the most part it still left me kind of cold; it is possible that there's simply a failing in the attempt to translate the &lt;em>bildungsroman&lt;/em> to film, or that neither of these directors, both of whom seemed to be going for a kind of gritty-realism-combined-with-fantasy-escapism, weren;t quite sure how to do what they wanted to do without the fantasy-escapism bit going over into the blatantly-unrealistic realms of, say, &lt;em>The Passion of Darkly Noon&lt;/em> (or, more contemporarily, Guillermo del Toro's wonderful coming-of-age fantasies &lt;em>El Espinazo del Diablo&lt;/em> and &lt;em>El Laberinto del Fauno&lt;/em>), which neither director wanted to do. The end result: two oddly unsatisfying movies, though in every way that matters, &lt;em>Treeless Mountain&lt;/em> is the superior of the two.Plot: Two young girls, Jin and Bin (non-actors Hee-yeon and Song-hee Kim, respectively; Hee-yeon has never acted before, Song-hee is on her second screen appearance here), are left by their cosmopolitan mother (Soo-ah Lee, also in her first screen appearance) with their hard-drinking, working-class aunt, known in the film only as Big Aunt (&lt;em>Jesus Hospital&lt;/em>'s Mi-hyang Kim in her feature debut), while she goes off looking for their father after receiving a mysterious letter. Or so she says, anyway; as time goes on and she does not return, her motives become suspect. Ultimately, however, they are irrelevant, as the story focuses on the two girls, who try to make their way in their new, hardscrabble society, returning each day to a barren hillock, the treeless mountain of the title, that overlooks the bus stop where they expect their mother to return.There is a general problem with movies like this, and there is a problem more specific to this one. The general one is that nothing much really happens in such movies, and so the movie is by definition driven by characters, not plot. The choice of non-actors for most of the roles here was a bold one, but I'm not sure it was the right one given the story. To say this is not, I hope, to take anything away from those actors; they all do a very good job with what they have here, but had they had more experience under their collective belt, I think they could have turned it into a bigger, wider whole than it is. The more specific problem has to do with where Kim, who also wrote the screenplay, ends the story. I can't go into a great amount of detail without spoilers, but I think this movie woud have worked better had it ended either ten minutes before it did (before, without being spoilery, Big Aunt makes the decision that drives the last sequences of the film) or ten minutes after (in which we would have had more time to explore the ramifications of the event in question).None of this is meant to convey that I didn't like the film. I did, and I do recommend it; just be aware that what you're getting may not exactly be what you think you're getting. (A warning for the animal lovers: there is a sequence in the middle of the film that involves the roasting and eating of grasshoppers a number of times.) ***",3,"Exquisitely shot, though ultimately unfulfilling.",1347235200,"09 10, 2012",2012,3534,"['lt', 'strong', '>', 'Treeless', 'Mountain', 'lt', '>', 'So-yong', 'Kim', '2008', 'Not', 'long', 'ago', 'reviewed', 'failed-potential', 'coming-of-age', 'film', 'called', 'lt', '>', 'Trees', 'Grow', 'Tall', 'Then', 'Fall', 'lt', '>', 'q.v.', 'number', 'thing', 'common', 'lt', '>', 'Treeless', 'Mountain', 'lt', '>', 'titles', 'making', 'reference', 'trees', 'many', 'places', 'where', 'former', 'film', 'things', 'wrong', 'lt', '>', 'Treeless', 'Mountain', 'lt', '>', 'things', 'right', 'yet', 'most', 'part', 'still', 'left', 'kind', 'cold', 'possible', 'simply', 'failing', 'attempt', 'translate', 'lt', '>', 'bildungsroman', 'lt', '>', 'film', 'directors', 'whom', 'seemed', 'be', 'going', 'kind', 'gritty-realism-combined-with-fantasy-escapism', 'weren', 'quite', 'sure', 'how', 'do', 'what', 'wanted', 'do', 'fantasy-escapism', 'bit', 'going', 'blatantly-unrealistic', 'realms', 'say', 'lt', '>', 'Passion', 'Darkly', 'Noon', 'lt', '>', 'more', 'contemporarily', 'Guillermo', 'del', 'Toro', 'wonderful', 'coming-of-age', 'fantasies', 'lt', '>', 'El', 'Espinazo', 'del', 'Diablo', 'lt', '>', 'lt', '>', 'El', 'Laberinto', 'del', 'Fauno', 'lt', '/em', '>', 'director', 'wanted', 'do', 'end', 'result', 'two', 'oddly', 'unsatisfying', 'movies', 'though', 'way', 'matters', 'lt', '>', 'Treeless', 'Mountain', 'lt', '>', 'superior', 'two.Plot', 'Two', 'young', 'girls', 'Jin', 'Bin', 'non-actors', 'Hee-yeon', 'Song-hee', 'Kim', 'respectively', 'Hee-yeon', 'never', 'acted', 'Song-hee', 'second', 'screen', 'appearance', 'here', 'are', 'left', 'cosmopolitan', 'mother', 'Soo-ah', 'Lee', 'also', 'first', 'screen', 'appearance', 'hard-drinking', 'working-class', 'aunt', 'known', 'film', 'only', 'as', 'Big', 'Aunt', 'lt', '>', 'Jesus', 'Hospital', 'lt', '/em', '>', 'Mi-hyang', 'Kim', 'feature', 'debut', 'looking', 'father', 'receiving', 'mysterious', 'letter', 'so', 'anyway', 'time', 'not', 'return', 'become', 'suspect', 'Ultimately', 'however', 'are', 'irrelevant', 'story', 'two', 'girls', 'who', 'try', 'make', 'way', 'new', 'hardscrabble', 'society', 'returning', 'day', 'barren', 'hillock', 'treeless', 'mountain', 'title', 'bus', 'stop', 'where', 'expect', 'mother', 'return.There', 'general', 'problem', 'movies', 'problem', 'more', 'specific', 'one', 'general', 'one', 'nothing', 'much', 'really', 'such', 'movies', 'so', 'movie', 'definition', 'driven', 'characters', 'not', 'plot', 'choice', 'non-actors', 'most', 'roles', 'here', 'was', 'bold', 'one', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'was', 'right', 'one', 'given', 'story', 'say', 'not', 'hope', 'take', 'anything', 'away', 'actors', 'do', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'what', 'have', 'here', 'had', 'had', 'more', 'experience', 'collective', 'belt', 'think', 'could', 'have', 'turned', 'bigger', 'wider', 'whole', 'more', 'specific', 'problem', 'do', 'where', 'Kim', 'who', 'also', 'wrote', 'screenplay', 'story', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'great', 'amount', 'detail', 'spoilers', 'think', 'movie', 'woud', 'have', 'worked', 'better', 'had', 'ended', 'either', 'ten', 'minutes', 'did', 'being', 'spoilery', 'Big', 'Aunt', 'decision', 'last', 'sequences', 'film', 'ten', 'minutes', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'more', 'time', 'explore', 'ramifications', 'event', 'question', '.None', 'meant', 'convey', 'did', ""n't"", 'film', 'did', 'do', 'recommend', 'just', 'be', 'aware', 'what', ""'re"", 'getting', 'may', 'not', 'exactly', 'be', 'what', 'think', ""'re"", 'getting', 'warning', 'animal', 'lovers', 'sequence', 'middle', 'film', 'roasting', 'eating', 'grasshoppers', 'number', 'times', '***']",N/A

Behind the touching story of young, six-year-old Jin and her little sister Bin and their quest for a place in this tumultuous world, lies a parable about the devastating effects of globalism.The first half of the movie shows a continuous plight of deprivation, uncertainty and more than a little heartbreak as Jin and Bin are forced to fend largely for themselves in a world of Western culture-influenced, big city life in Seoul, South Korea. Likewise, the harsh economic realities of this life serves to reek havoc on the lives of their mother, father and ""Big Aunt"", depriving the young girls of the stability and care that is so essential to children in their formative years.After their ""Big Aunt"" can (or is unwilling to) no longer take care of them, the girls are dropped off at their grandparent's home in the country. While seemingly even more impoverished than their mother and aunt, it is their grandmother who teaches the young girls how to live in a happy, fulfilling, healthy, albeit modest manner. Trully, not since Christ taught on the earth has there been so clear an example set for how mankind ought to live. Should the lifestyle found at the end of this film be meshed with true, Biblical Christianity (as opposed to the kind you see and hear for the most part on the radio and TV), one would know how it is to live according to the will of God.

As I watched these young children (5 & 7) make their way through their Korean world, I thought of similarly aged children here in the U.S. and how sheltered and spoiled they are comparatively. How relative is hardship?That issue aside, Treeless Mountain is a lovely, albeit slow, and often sad movie that underscores the strength of children and the flexibility of family and community. Despite being bandied about from a mother who can't support them to an aunt who doesn't wish to care for them, they press on with strikingly strong survival skills and a deep love for each other. Their innocence, trust, and purity of heart are tested by a world that takes little note of them as they wait hopefully for their mother to return. Eventually, the two girls end up in the sympathetic and loving care of their grandmother, whose genuine tenderness and concern bring joy and song back into their lives.The director uses shots of the sky as segues from one scene to another. One memorable and poignant transition shows the sun enveloped by a dark and sinister looking cloud. Just as the shot ends, the sun breaks free on the other side of the cloud's mandible-like grasp.
