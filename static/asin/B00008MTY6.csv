It's very much a John Wayne movie, with the Duke being literally Duke (his character's name) and yeoman performances by the supporting cast. Patricia Neal, just beginning to develop her emotional range, was preoccupied with her off-screen affair with Gary Cooper. The chemistry she and Wayne would have in In Harms Way 15 years later is absent in this film. One interesting moment is when the crew watches Destination Tokyo with Cary Grant and makes snide remarks about Hollywood submariners. The heavy-handed piety and phoney man-talk are typical of the time but are derisable now.",3,Good For Its Genre,1090972800,"07 28, 2004",2004,648,"['genre', 'sub', 'movies', 'good', 'hardly', 'best', 'very', 'much', 'John', 'Wayne', 'movie', 'Duke', 'being', 'literally', 'Duke', 'character', 'name', 'yeoman', 'performances', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Patricia', 'Neal', 'just', 'beginning', 'develop', 'emotional', 'range', 'was', 'preoccupied', 'off-screen', 'affair', 'Gary', 'Cooper', 'chemistry', 'Wayne', 'would', 'have', 'Harms', 'Way', '15', 'years', 'later', 'absent', 'film', 'One', 'interesting', 'moment', 'when', 'crew', 'Destination', 'Tokyo', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'snide', 'remarks', 'Hollywood', 'submariners', 'heavy-handed', 'piety', 'phoney', 'man-talk', 'are', 'typical', 'time', 'are', 'derisable', 'now']",N/A

There are cute vignettes with a band of rescued orphans and a soldier from Alabama.  However, when all is said and done it is a war movie.  For fans of this genre this movie is probably excellent.  For those of us not so inclined, it gets to be rather dull once the orphans are placed in safe hands.  While John Wayne was an American icon during his time, nowadays his fame is somewhat mystifying.  As he is a rather stiff bloke and speaks in a very cracky monotone.  My apologies to fans of his in saying that, but that is how he comes across to me.  As far as special effects are concerned and filming, it does appear of be of high quality.

Wayne is Duke Gifford, executive officer of the Thunderfish for Ward Bond's Commander ""Pop"" Perry, during the dark days of the Pacific war when the U.S. Navy submarine force was trying to carry the war to the enemy.Director George Waggner packs a lot of plot into the movie.  The Thunderfish will be dogged by Japanese destroyers, problems with dud torpedoes, and rivalries at sea and on shore.  The sets on and off the submarine look authentic.  One of the better plot points is the competition between Gifford and another officer for the affections of a tough-minded Navy nurse (Patricia Neal), who happens to be Gifford's ex-wife.  Martin Milner has a terrific cameo as a fresh-faced Ensign who learns something about the realities of war.

745336,A36VM510YNVLFP,B00008MTY6,E. R. Christensen,"[0, 0]","I've got to say this is not one of the Duke's better movies.  A submarine rescue of a group of nuns and children starts the movie off.  That's tolerable.  The torpedoes don't work and Duke decides to avoid reassignment to the states by sticking around to fix the problem.  Not a problem.  But two scenes really made me lose credibility with the film.  First, no torpedoes, so they go topside and take on a Japanese ship with their small arms coming out the winner while greatly outgunned.  Captain Duke picks up the machine gun of a downed crewman and goes right to work - submariners who look more like Marines.  Too much for me to take.  The second scene I just couldn't tolerate is when his estranged wife tells him off (with good reason) then another nurse who'd overheard the conversation tells her how wrong she is, so she goes crawling back - no way, never happen in real life, but hey, it's the DUKE.  With the torpedoes finally working, they end up in the middle of the entire Japanese fleet.  No, it's not Midway, and I won't give it away.  I like most John Wayne movies, I have a large collection of them, but this one's headed for a garage sale.  As for the dvd, it's b & w, with no special features to speak of - abridged cast bios, subtitles, and trailer.  Bottom line, it's over the top, moreso than usual.  Directed by George Waggner, who never really did anything beyond B movies - this fits the bill.  If one looks at any list of John Wayne's best movies, you'll see they're mostly westerns, a fantasy world.  His WWII films are generally no where near as good - he'd have won a Medal of Honor in any one of them (but then Audie Murphy did win a M of H, while the Duke managed to avoid military service).  If you're a Wayne fan, it's worth a look, but don't be spending much for that look. I debated between a 2 and a 3 rating and went with the 2 because there's no shortage of John Wayne movies out there that are so much better.  It's not on the level of ""The Conquerer"" or ""The Green Berets"", but neither is it anywhere near as good as ""Stagecoach"", ""The Shootist"", ""She Wore a Yellow Ribbon"" and so many more.  But I would add, I believe it's much closer to the former group than the later and I sure don't think you'll find it on anybody's list of best submarine movies.",2,"Damn the torpedoes, full speed ahead.",1346371200,"08 31, 2012",2012,2293,"[""'ve"", 'got', 'say', 'not', 'one', 'Duke', 'better', 'movies', 'submarine', 'rescue', 'group', 'nuns', 'children', 'movie', 'off', 'tolerable', 'torpedoes', 'do', ""n't"", 'work', 'Duke', 'avoid', 'reassignment', 'states', 'sticking', 'around', 'fix', 'problem', 'Not', 'problem', 'two', 'scenes', 'really', 'made', 'lose', 'credibility', 'film', 'First', 'torpedoes', 'go', 'topside', 'take', 'Japanese', 'ship', 'small', 'arms', 'coming', 'out', 'winner', 'greatly', 'outgunned', 'Captain', 'Duke', 'up', 'machine', 'gun', 'downed', 'crewman', 'right', 'work', 'submariners', 'who', 'look', 'more', 'like', 'Marines', 'Too', 'much', 'take', 'second', 'scene', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'tolerate', 'when', 'estranged', 'wife', 'tells', 'off', 'good', 'reason', 'then', 'nurse', 'who', 'overheard', 'conversation', 'how', 'wrong', 'crawling', 'back', 'way', 'never', 'happen', 'real', 'life', 'hey', 'DUKE', 'torpedoes', 'finally', 'working', 'end', 'up', 'middle', 'entire', 'Japanese', 'fleet', 'No', 'not', 'Midway', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'like', 'most', 'John', 'Wayne', 'movies', 'have', 'large', 'collection', 'one', 'headed', 'garage', 'sale', 'dvd', 'b', 'w', 'special', 'features', 'speak', 'abridged', 'cast', 'bios', 'subtitles', 'trailer', 'Bottom', 'line', 'top', 'moreso', 'usual', 'Directed', 'George', 'Waggner', 'who', 'never', 'really', 'did', 'anything', 'B', 'movies', 'bill', 'one', 'list', 'John', 'Wayne', 'best', 'movies', ""'ll"", 'see', ""'re"", 'mostly', 'westerns', 'fantasy', 'world', 'WWII', 'films', 'are', 'generally', 'where', 'near', 'good', ""'d"", 'have', 'won', 'Medal', 'Honor', 'one', 'then', 'Audie', 'Murphy', 'did', 'win', 'M', 'H', 'Duke', 'managed', 'avoid', 'military', 'service', ""'re"", 'Wayne', 'fan', 'look', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'spending', 'much', 'look', 'debated', '2', '3', 'rating', 'went', '2', 'shortage', 'John', 'Wayne', 'movies', 'out', 'there', 'are', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'not', 'level', 'Conquerer', 'Green', 'Berets', 'anywhere', 'as', 'good', 'Stagecoach', 'Shootist', 'Wore', 'Yellow', 'Ribbon', 'so', 'many', 'more', 'would', 'add', 'believe', 'much', 'closer', 'former', 'group', 'later', 'sure', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', ""'ll"", 'find', 'anybody', 'list', 'best', 'submarine', 'movies']",N/A

I DVR'd it and watched it, as I have done a number of times in the past.Like most movies of the era, it seriously sanitizes war. Very little in the movie is really believable, although supposedly several details in the movie were based on incidents that actually happened.The movie starts out with John Wayne playing the XO of a sub who is sent off on a commando mission with a few of the other crew of his sub to rescue some children, a baby, and a few nuns from a Japanese held island. At one point it is stated that the nuns had to walk 40 miles through the jungle with the children to make it to the sub. It implied John Wayne's character walked there first and then back with the nuns and their charges. Not real likely, but the kind of heart warming thing you see in movies of the era.The captain is killed in action and John Wayne gets command. It is a fairly typical vehicle for the Duke. If you appreciate this kind of movie you will like this one.Patricia Neal plays his ex-wife and current love interest.back then things were a lot simpler, at least in the movies.

745341,A4SY5RCGC5CH9,B00008MTY6,"Maciej ""Darth Maciek""","[0, 0]","Made in 1951 when United States were in the middle of Korea War, this is more a propaganda film than a war movie and therefore has all the charm and limitations of this kind of productions. Below, more of my impressions, with some SPOILERS.The tribute character of this film is immediately established by the opening statement, which deserves to be cited in its integrality: ""When the Pacific Fleet was destroyed by the Japanese sneak attack on Pearl Harbor, it remained for the submarines to carry the war to the enemy. In the four years that followed, our undersea craft sank six million tons of Japanese shipping including some of the proudest ships of the Imperial Navy. Fifty-two of our submarines and thirty-five hundred officers and men were lost. It is to these men and the entire silent service that this picture is humbly dedicated.""This film describes the adventures and misfortunes of a fictitious submarine, USS ""Thunderfish"" (no ship of that name ever served in US Navy), during Pacific War. The main here of the film is the executive officer (n2), Lieutenant Commander Duke Gifford (John Wayne), a competent and courageous officer who just suffered a heartbreaking divorce. Other important characters on board of the sub are the commanding officer, Commander John T. Perry (Ward Bond), a junior officer, Lieutenant Larry (Scott Forbes) and Chief Petty Officer, known to all as simply ""Chief"" (Jack Pennick).Now, this film is slightly hurt by the all present pathos and ultra-patriotic tone, but it would not be an issue if the rest of it was good. Sadly, it is not the case. The great problem with this film is that it seems all the time to hesitate between being a document and a war movie - and ultimately it doesn't succeed entirely in neither. To say things plainly, even if I am a military history freak and a great fan of John Wayne, I found large parts of this film BORING and poorly organised!There is too much time devoted to Gifford's efforts to re-conquer his ex-wife Mary (Patricia Neal), the supposed love triangle between Gifford, Mary and Bob Perry (son of Commander Perry) is really so artificial that it is ridiculous and there is DEFINITELY too much time devoted to the evacuation of civilians (nuns and orphans) from a Japanese occupied island. Action scenes are really not that great, there is very little humour and dialogs are pretty lame. Last but not least, the great torpedo crisis which so horribly affected US Navy between 1941 and 1943 is shown here in a way which carefully avoids all the numerous ugly and ridiculous aspects of this enormous scandal - instead it served to us sugar-coated and on a pink plate...A precision here concering (ATTENTION SPOILER HERE!) the scenes with a Japanese Q-Ship in action - in fact during the World War II the Imperial Navy deployed only one such unit, the ""Delhi Maru"", but her mission was a total fiasco as she was sunk by a three torpedo salvo by USS ""Swordfish"" in January 1944 without ever being able to use her guns...That being said, the film has also some redeeming qualities. Action scenes are inspired by real events, especially the dramatic fight which took place on 7 February 1943 between USS ""Growler"" and an armed Japanese Navy auxilliary (supplies transport) ""Hayasaki"" as well as the even more famous submarine attack against Japanese cruisers in Palawan Passage on 23 October 1944. The few lighter scenes are quite good, especially one in which the crew of the USS ""Thunderfish"" watches with some incredulity another famous submarine movie, ""Destination Tokyo"" (see my review of this one).

Mary Stuart (Neal), a Navy nurse in Honolulu.  The first few scenes between Gifford, Neal, Pop and his younger brother Bob (Philip Carey) are really nicely handled; director George Waggner seems to have a good touch with romantic and seriocomic scenes, and he does a good job in building the tension in Gifford as he recognizes that he has a rival in Bob for his ex-wife's affections.  But there are a couple of later scenes, after the death of Pop, that seem misguided, in particular a confrontation between Gifford and Bob that leads into a scene between Gifford and Mary that just doesn't come off convincingly.  Wayne is quite solid in the film overall but this scene in which he gets blamed for his friend's death and then has to basically tell Mary that the ship is the most important thing to him finds him at sea, as it were - it feels underehearsed and awkward.  There are a couple of other problematic sequences like this, including one where his CO tells him that he's got to stay in the dock rather than go back out to sea, and this combined with a general mediocrity in the production outside of the submarine scenes leads me to wonder if perhaps the budget wasn't all that terrific here, and there wasn't enough time or money to put together some of these dramatic scenes adequately.I'm also not all that impressed with Patricia Neal here; she can come off as kind of superior and bitchy at times even when it's not called for and I feel a little of that in this performance.  Bond on the other hand is great and most of the other seamen are very credible.  John Pennick as the Chief has a memorable face that many viewers of this film will recognize from his work in John Ford films - in fact the whole film often has the feel of low-rent Ford, with a scene where Gifford bails out his men for fighting with a bunch of Hawaiians in particular being very reminiscent of some of the ""character"" scenes in Ford's war films and westerns.This is probably the least-impressive John Wayne war film I've seen so far, one that I'd recommend mostly to serious fans of the actor or of submarine films; I watched it along with a group of his other WWII stuff and in comparison with a masterpiece likeThey Were Expendableit looks a bit weak.  And certainly there are plenty of better submarine films out there.

The submarine here, the U.S.S. Thunderfish, returns to Pearl Harbor in mid-mission because its torpedoes have begun misfiring. The episode mimics a real event during the war, in which many sub crews were experiencing the same problem. It required a desperate effort to find the source of the misfires, because without their torpedoes subs were virtually defenseless.

But Operation Pacific with John Wayne is not often mentioned or known as a quality WWII submarine war movie, which is too bad because it's a more than solid movie.  Returning from a mission that required the crew to rescue two nuns and a group of little kids off a Japanese-held island, the USS Thunderfish returns to Pearl Harbor.  Back in port, Lt. Commander Duke Gifford hopes to get back together with his divorced wife, Mary Stuart, and rekindle the love they had four years before.  But before he can win her back, the Thunderfish is sent back out on patrol, and with torpedoes that don't blow on impact.  The rest of the movie involves the effort to fix the firing pins along with the Thunderfish's involvement at the battle of Leyte Gulf.  The sub footage is excellent here as the Thunderfish goes up against everything the Japanese Navy has to offer and more.  And unlike a lot of movies with forced love stories, the relationship between Duke and Mary is believable and doesn't detract from the movie overall.  A good blend of action, drama and some laughs, Operation Pacific isn't a well-known WWII sub movie, but it's definitely worth a look.John Wayne had it easy here, starring as a character with his own nickname, Lt. Cmdr. Duke Gifford.  Gifford is the first officer on the Thunderfish who while trying to win his ex-wife back has to deal with some unexpected problems that arise.  Patricia Neal is a good sparring partner for Wayne as Mary Stuart, his ex-wife and a nurse at Pearl Harbor.  Wayne and Neal's scenes together keep the movie going instead of grinding it to a halt.  Ward Bond is perfect as Cmdr. ""Pop"" Perry, the commander of the Thunderfish and Gifford's best friend.  Wayne and Bond together were always perfect together, and here is no different.  Phillip Carey plays Lt. Perry, Pop's kid brother who is trying to marry Mary which doesn't go over well for Gifford.  The crew of the sub includes Scott Forbes, Martin Milner, Paul Picerni in a funny role, William Campbell, Vincent Fotre, Sam Edwards, and in maybe his meatiest part, and his best, Jack Pennick as the Chief.The DVD is a good deal with a clean B&W; standard presentation that looks pretty smooth throughout although it's fairly obvious when war footage is inserted in.  Only special features here are a trailer and some brief filmographies of the cast, Wayne, Neal, and Bond.  But overall, fans of submarine movies won't be disappointed here, especially with Wayne and Bond together again.

I recommend this movie-it is very entertaining.",4,The Duke Wins the War,1359590400,"01 31, 2013",2013,389,"['John', 'Wayne', 'defeated', 'Japanese', 'Empire', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'least', 'what', 'movie', 'show', 'kidding', 'aside', 'good', 'movie', 'Duke', 'commander', 'submarine', 'starting', 'when', 'Japs', 'murder', 'first', 'commander', 'sub', 'plenty', 'action', 'good', 'romantic', 'subplot', 'excellant', 'plotline', 'recommend', 'movie-it', 'very', 'entertaining']",N/A
