Burns quit his previous job after his partner was shot and killed, and Burns feels responsible. The two most eligible females in Lunacy, Charleen Galligan (Rosanna Arquette) and her daughter Meg (LeAnne Rimes), are both romantically interested in him. Charleen's husband disappeared a decade earlier and the family assumed he'd just upped and left. But now two young climbers find his body with an ice-pick in his chest, so the search is on for his killer. Several of the townsfolk are resentful at Burns because they thought someone from the town should have got the job, not an outsider. Now, although the state police want to take over the case, Burns insists on handling it because he believes the killer is still in town.

1264262,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B002DU39J4,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[0, 0]","I don't much read Nora Roberts, so I can't speak to the faithfulness of this made-for-TV adaptation to its source material. What I know is that even though Northern Lights is fairly by-the-numbers, it still held my attention. Partly, it's the curiosity factor. I wanted to see how well LeAnn Rimes can transition to acting. She does fine.It's a 2009 Lifetime Channel movie that taps into a familiar premise: that of a newcomer to Alaska falling for a spirited bush pilot. It's not as successful in channeling Northern Exposure's appealing central staple, which is its quirkiness. Northern Lights introduces burnt-out ex-Baltimore homicide detective Nate Burns (Eddie Cibrian), come to the fictional town of Lunacy, Alaska to outrun pangs of guilt and remorse. Nate has had enough of big city crime. As Lunacy's new police chief, he's looking forward to negotiating the more sedatechallenges posed by a remote, sleepy town. And to add even more incentive, Nate catches a glimpse of local bush pilot Meg Galligan (Rimes) and is instantly beguiled. They formally meet on New Year's Eve, an auspicious date that is not at all flushed with romance.But here's that clich&eacute; rearing its ugly  head, the one about small towns, big secrets. Nate hasn't even had time to settle in before he turns up a 15-year-old murder, one that holds special ties to his favorite bush pilot. It takes a minute to worm oneself into the good graces of a closed-in community like Lunacy's. Ingratiation is specially hampered when one starts digging up nasty secrets. Can the new police chief hold down his job long enough to solve a murder or two? Certain citizens are grumbling about the decision to hire an outsider like Nate. After all, Lunacy's window of tourism doesn't extend past summer. Who needs an all-seasons police chief, and an outsider at that?LeAnn Rimes and Eddie Cibrian happen to be married in real life, and there's a bit of that synergy captured on camera, a certain comfort level. Cibrian, with his affability and his exasperating matinee idol looks, is likable. But I tuned in for LeAnn Rimes, and it seems to me that she lights up the screen. Rimes infuses spunk and vitality into her character. Meg Galligan is someone who asserts herself and who is comfortable in her own skin. In one scene, she even saves the new police chief's bacon. Chalk that one up to a lesson learned about the vagaries of moose meat bait.Northern Lights is a rote murder mystery, made all the more routine by our sleuth's underwhelming ""eureka"" moment. How Nate arrives at the killer's identity smacks of dipping into that barrel of standard TV mystery investigative tropes.Thank goodness the potential for a Cibrian-Rosanna Arquette romance was nipped in the bud early on. In light of Arquette's character's relationship with Rimes, that would've been pretty icky. Still, it's nice to see such a well-preserved Rosanna Arquette. She plays the promiscuous innkeeper (with a, yes, heart of gold).I love the gruff-looking dog. What breed is he? Seems like a mix of American bulldog and awesome.Mt. No Name is a cool name for a mountain.With an aggressive name like Deputy Otto Gruber, I expected him to be more prominent in the film. After a while he just fades into the background. Bit disappointing. I wanted him and his new boss to clash more.3.5 out of 5 stars for this one. The showdown with the murderer goes down ridiculously. Nate actually made a solid call in his strategy for catching the guy. Too bad other folks took the play out of his hand. But it's one more thing that cheapens the movie. The fictional town of Lunacy was founded in 1805, much like the mystery elements here. If you watch this and end up enjoying it, I've no doubt it's because of what LeAnn Rimes brings to the table. I hear she can sing, too.",4,"""Words of advice, Chief, in Lunacy, things that seem one way usually aren't.""",1397952000,"04 20, 2014",2014,3802,"['do', ""n't"", 'much', 'read', 'Nora', 'Roberts', 'ca', ""n't"", 'speak', 'faithfulness', 'made-for-TV', 'adaptation', 'source', 'material', 'What', 'know', 'even', 'Northern', 'Lights', 'fairly', 'by-the-numbers', 'still', 'held', 'attention', 'Partly', 'curiosity', 'factor', 'wanted', 'see', 'how', 'well', 'LeAnn', 'Rimes', 'can', 'transition', 'acting', 'fine.It', '2009', 'Lifetime', 'Channel', 'movie', 'familiar', 'premise', 'newcomer', 'Alaska', 'falling', 'spirited', 'bush', 'pilot', 'not', 'as', 'successful', 'channeling', 'Northern', 'Exposure', 'appealing', 'central', 'staple', 'quirkiness', 'Northern', 'Lights', 'burnt-out', 'ex-Baltimore', 'homicide', 'detective', 'Nate', 'Burns', 'Eddie', 'Cibrian', 'come', 'fictional', 'town', 'Lunacy', 'Alaska', 'outrun', 'pangs', 'guilt', 'remorse', 'Nate', 'had', 'enough', 'big', 'city', 'crime', 'Lunacy', 'new', 'police', 'chief', 'looking', 'forward', 'negotiating', 'more', 'sedatechallenges', 'posed', 'remote', 'sleepy', 'town', 'add', 'even', 'more', 'incentive', 'Nate', 'glimpse', 'local', 'bush', 'pilot', 'Meg', 'Galligan', 'Rimes', 'instantly', 'beguiled', 'formally', 'meet', 'New', 'Year', 'Eve', 'auspicious', 'date', 'not', 'flushed', 'romance.But', 'here', 'clich', 'eacute', 'rearing', 'ugly', 'head', 'one', 'small', 'towns', 'big', 'secrets', 'Nate', ""n't"", 'even', 'had', 'time', 'settle', 'up', '15-year-old', 'murder', 'one', 'special', 'ties', 'favorite', 'bush', 'pilot', 'minute', 'worm', 'good', 'graces', 'closed-in', 'community', 'Lunacy', 'Ingratiation', 'specially', 'hampered', 'when', 'one', 'digging', 'up', 'nasty', 'secrets', 'Can', 'new', 'police', 'chief', 'hold', 'down', 'job', 'long', 'enough', 'solve', 'murder', 'two', 'Certain', 'citizens', 'are', 'grumbling', 'decision', 'hire', 'outsider', 'Nate', 'Lunacy', 'window', 'tourism', ""n't"", 'extend', 'past', 'summer', 'Who', 'all-seasons', 'police', 'chief', 'outsider', 'LeAnn', 'Rimes', 'Eddie', 'Cibrian', 'happen', 'be', 'married', 'real', 'life', 'bit', 'synergy', 'captured', 'camera', 'certain', 'comfort', 'level', 'Cibrian', 'affability', 'exasperating', 'matinee', 'idol', 'looks', 'likable', 'tuned', 'LeAnn', 'Rimes', 'screen', 'spunk', 'vitality', 'character', 'Meg', 'Galligan', 'someone', 'who', 'herself', 'who', 'comfortable', 'own', 'skin', 'one', 'scene', 'even', 'new', 'police', 'chief', 'bacon', 'Chalk', 'one', 'up', 'lesson', 'learned', 'vagaries', 'moose', 'meat', 'bait.Northern', 'Lights', 'rote', 'murder', 'mystery', 'made', 'more', 'routine', 'sleuth', 'underwhelming', 'eureka', 'moment', 'How', 'Nate', 'arrives', 'killer', 'identity', 'smacks', 'dipping', 'barrel', 'standard', 'TV', 'mystery', 'investigative', 'tropes.Thank', 'goodness', 'potential', 'Cibrian-Rosanna', 'Arquette', 'romance', 'was', 'nipped', 'bud', 'early', 'light', 'Arquette', 'character', 'relationship', 'Rimes', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'pretty', 'icky', 'Still', 'nice', 'see', 'such', 'well-preserved', 'Rosanna', 'Arquette', 'promiscuous', 'innkeeper', 'yes', 'heart', 'gold', 'love', 'gruff-looking', 'dog', 'What', 'breed', 'mix', 'American', 'bulldog', 'awesome.Mt', 'Name', 'cool', 'name', 'mountain.With', 'aggressive', 'name', 'Deputy', 'Otto', 'Gruber', 'expected', 'be', 'more', 'prominent', 'film', 'while', 'just', 'background', 'Bit', 'disappointing', 'wanted', 'new', 'boss', 'clash', 'more.3.5', '5', 'stars', 'one', 'showdown', 'murderer', 'down', 'ridiculously', 'Nate', 'actually', 'made', 'solid', 'call', 'strategy', 'catching', 'guy', 'Too', 'bad', 'other', 'folks', 'took', 'play', 'hand', 'one', 'more', 'thing', 'movie', 'fictional', 'town', 'Lunacy', 'was', 'founded', '1805', 'much', 'mystery', 'here', 'watch', 'end', 'up', 'enjoying', ""'ve"", 'doubt', 'what', 'LeAnn', 'Rimes', 'table', 'hear', 'can', 'sing', 'too']",Northern Lights

What fascinated me about it was the writer's ability to create vividly a small Alaska town in mid-winter, when it is dark for all or most of the day and snow lies piled deep.  The plot was OK, a newly-hired cop meets an abrasive female bush pilot and gets mixed up in an old murder in the nearby mountains.  The characters were a trifle shallow, but the ambience made up for the slack.Now comes the movie, wherein the producers chose to ignore Ms Roberts well crafted atmosphere.  The town isn't right.  There's not nearly enough snow.  And, worst, on New Year's Eve the sun is high overhead in the afternoon.  Did they think that readers of the book and intelligent viewers wouldn't notice?In addition, the actors were completely unconvincing, particularly Ms Rimes, who is a country singer out of her milieu.  I was reminded of an anecdote regarding Dolly Parton in her movie acting debut.  A frustrated director stopped a scene and asked Parton, ""Can't you act at all?""  ""No,"" she answered, ""and your job is to make it look as if I can.""  In that case, the director succeeded, but the director of Ms Rimes failed completely.In short, the movie is a slapdash failure, not worth the time of anyone who enjoyed the book, and a time waster for those who didn't.",1,Ruined,1253059200,"09 16, 2009",2009,1339,"['novel', 'movie', 'based', 'was', 'first', 'Nora', 'Roberts', 'book', 'read', 'What', 'fascinated', 'was', 'writer', 'ability', 'create', 'vividly', 'small', 'Alaska', 'town', 'mid-winter', 'when', 'dark', 'most', 'day', 'snow', 'piled', 'deep', 'plot', 'was', 'OK', 'newly-hired', 'cop', 'meets', 'abrasive', 'female', 'bush', 'pilot', 'mixed', 'up', 'old', 'murder', 'nearby', 'mountains', 'characters', 'were', 'trifle', 'shallow', 'ambience', 'made', 'up', 'slack.Now', 'movie', 'wherein', 'producers', 'chose', 'ignore', 'Ms', 'Roberts', 'well', 'crafted', 'atmosphere', 'town', ""n't"", 'right', 'not', 'nearly', 'enough', 'snow', 'worst', 'New', 'Year', 'Eve', 'sun', 'high', 'overhead', 'afternoon', 'Did', 'think', 'readers', 'book', 'intelligent', 'viewers', 'would', ""n't"", 'notice', 'addition', 'actors', 'were', 'completely', 'unconvincing', 'particularly', 'Ms', 'Rimes', 'who', 'country', 'singer', 'milieu', 'was', 'reminded', 'anecdote', 'regarding', 'Dolly', 'Parton', 'movie', 'acting', 'debut', 'A', 'frustrated', 'director', 'stopped', 'scene', 'asked', 'Parton', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'act', 'No', 'answered', 'job', 'make', 'look', 'can', 'case', 'director', 'succeeded', 'director', 'Ms', 'Rimes', 'failed', 'completely.In', 'short', 'movie', 'slapdash', 'failure', 'not', 'time', 'anyone', 'who', 'enjoyed', 'book', 'time', 'waster', 'who', 'did', ""n't""]",Northern Lights

Particularly surprising was LeAnn Rimes acting, which was first rate.  It makes me wonder if she is changing careers or just adding a second one.  I enjoy her music, I think she is an much better actress than singer.I think that this was her first movie, but I am not certain about that.  If it is her first movie she hit a real home run with her initial performance.While not a great movie it is a very entertaining movie and well worth the purchase price.",4,Surprisingly Good,1340409600,"06 23, 2012",2012,536,"['Northern', 'Lights', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'who-done-it', 'movie', 'acted', 'out', 'Alaska', 'Particularly', 'surprising', 'was', 'LeAnn', 'Rimes', 'acting', 'was', 'first', 'rate', 'wonder', 'changing', 'careers', 'just', 'adding', 'second', 'one', 'enjoy', 'music', 'think', 'much', 'better', 'actress', 'singer.I', 'think', 'was', 'first', 'movie', 'am', 'not', 'certain', 'first', 'movie', 'hit', 'real', 'home', 'run', 'initial', 'performance.While', 'not', 'great', 'movie', 'very', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'well', 'purchase', 'price']",Northern Lights
