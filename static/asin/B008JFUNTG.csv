1557249,APZAJ6LGXH02F,B008JFUNTG,Ace Reader,"[7, 11]","I have not read any of the Percy Jackson"" books. I am coming to this films story without any foreknowledge of it's story line. I loved the first film ""Percy Jackson & the Olympians: The Lightning Thief"", (2010).I enjoyed ""Percy Jackson: Sea of Monsters"". It is entertaining, but where were the sea of monsters? I was expecting a lot of sea monsters! I got one. Also this film confused me in several ways.1. Percy Jackson (played by expertly by Logan Lerman), lacked confidence in himself throughout the entire film.2. He let a girl (Clarisse (played by Leven Rambin), god of wars daughter) steal his glory at every turn.I haven't seen the first installment for a while now so I may have forgotten a few points. These problems will be worse for anyone who has never watched the first film.3. And why is Clarisse so mean to Percy and he just takes it? There is no background story in this film to explain her massive aggression towards his character. This was strange, confusing, and I for one did not understand it or like it.This second installment of ""Percy Jackson"", based on the book written by author Rick Riordan was not as good as this first film by a long shot. The screenplay is written by Marc Guggenheim and it's missing the heart and excitement that the first one had in spades. It was slow going in parts and Percy's character was not allowed to be the hero I had expected and wanted him to be in this film. His character IS allowed to save the day. But then the credit for it is given up (without a fight) to an undeserving character that bugged me a lot. I read up about this characters personality traits and found that Percy Jackson's character is the hero in the books. He is the brave, spirited, confident leader of Camp Half-blood. He's also a rebel and dislikes being manipulated or forced to obey others. His fatal flaw is excessive loyalty: he would risk the world and even his own life to save a loved one or even a stranger according to Athena. He's respected by ALL the Olympians. He should not have any doubts about his abilities or his path. At least that was what I had expected. And sadly never once in this film do we get to see any of the Olympian gods that made the first film so great!""Percy Jackson: Sea of Monsters"" is enjoyable, but a miss for me. It will be an enjoyable film for parents to take their kids to, but don't expect the story quality to be like the first film. Recommended with reservations.

In many ways I prefer Percy Jackson because it is less pretentious and has a lot more action. Do make sure you catch the first Percy Jackson film before seeing this one! I haven't read the books, but I presume we are seeing Percy growing towards becoming a true hero and leader; so this is a story of personal development. As such I applaud the good intentions but it was just slightly over-played. In the end I found Percy just a bit too self-effacing for his own good. The plot line is okay, the special effects excellent, and the acting all it was required to be. A good film leaves you thinking and emotionally involved in the characters. Unfortunately I wasn't.

When my oldest was in junior high and had stated playing football games that we would have to travel to, my other three were bored. I decided that my daughter who at the time would not pick up a book if her life depended on it, that the three of them would benefit from me reading out loud to them. I started with the first in the series and trust me they were not happy, but about half way into the book they were hooked. Not only did I read to them whole traveling to games but they also put down the game controller, yes I said they put down the game controllers and came and got in my bed with me and I spent an hour or two reading to them.

The result, as you may expect, is that he's devouring Percy Jackson content like crazy.  My daughter, almost 3, has a crush on Percy Jackson as well so for better or worse I'm usually stuck watching one of these movies at least a few times a week.  We cut the cord with cable/satellite so it's streaming movies only for our household, but that's another story.Back to the film.  While the first movie was good the second has improved on that formula and put out a sequel that is even more entertaining.  The biggest strike against this film is the re-casting of Pierce Bronson's character.  No idea why that happened (availability, cost, creative differences), but all things being equal, a single character re-cast as a gripe isn't that bad I suppose.  Lots of action in this sequel and the special effects are very good.I've not read the books, but it seems that anyone who is a huge fan of any written series may well be disappointed by a film adaptation.  It's just not possible to incorporate EVERY aspect of the book into a movie.  If you divorce the two, and view them as separate entities you are better off.  My understanding is that this movie is much truer to the book, but my son hasn't complained about either, but if you are a purist you will probably enjoy this more than the first.It's a good teenage romp following a group of demi-gods on their quest to find the golden fleece and stop the impending resurrection of the original titan, Kronos.

It was inventive in the way it used the mythological source material, and I enjoyed it without feeling like I was far outside its target demographic.  I can't imagine anyone past their teens really liking the sequel, and even then, I doubt it will ever be anybody's favorite.A big problem here is that the franchise's best ideas all seem to be tied up with explaining how the whole demigod thing works, and they already did that in the last movie.  It should be that once the origin story is out of the way, you can focus on exciting adventures, but even the quest plot in this one seems way less interesting than the first movie's.  The protagonists have to find the golden fleece, and they already know pretty much where it is, so they go there and find it.  They have to fight a few people and monsters along the way, but none of it feels very dangerous.  When a problem comes up that can't be solved with punching, the movie just gives Percy a new magic power or a convenient item to deal with it.  Even the villain seems bored with the proceedings.  It's the same guy as the last movie, and the closest we get to an explanation of his plot or motivation is basically, &#8220;I'm gonna try to blow up Olympus again, for... whatever reason I said last time.&#8221;The major novel element in this movie is a new character, whose personality throughout boils down to &#8220;very enthusiastic and also dumb.&#8221;  Not, like, comically so &#8211; just higher-than-average enthusiasm and lower-than-average intelligence.  I began to feel sorry for the actor playing him, because most of the stuff they gave him to do is like watching someone's vacation videos: &#8220;I'm really glad I'm on this trip with you guys.  This is fun!  Whoops, I dropped that thing I was supposed to hold onto!&#8221;On the whole, this movie felt like it was trying too hard to appeal to angsty teenagers without offending their parents.  Percy whinges constantly about being worried that he's not good enough, and the big epiphany at the end is some claptrap about making your own destiny (which barely even makes sense, because Percy just did one out of the two options he was prophesied to fulfill).  The villains are teasingly sympathetic because they've concluded that parents and teachers don't have all the answers, but the right path turns out to be for the heroes to do what they've been told and trust in the value of teamwork.  If you're 11, this all may work just fine for you.

I have not read the books behind the films so I am not able to judge how faithful the adaptation is, but the new Percy Jackson: Sea of Monsters is entertaining and a lot of fun to watch.** Spoilers below**Percy has quite a few challenges in this film, chief of which is an identity crisis. Having completed a quest successfully in the first film (Percy Jackson and the Lightening Thief) he is finding himself inadequate in competing with other half-bloods, particularly Clarisse, who enjoys taunting him. Along with Percy's self-doubt, he discovers he has a half-brother named Tyson, who is a Cyclops.  Annabeth also has a loathing of Cyclopes', in general, because one killed a half-blood named Thalia, a daughter of Zeus no less. Zeus transformed his daughter into a tree that provides a barrier for Camp Halfblood. However, the tree is poisoned, so a quest is proposed to take the Golden Fleece as it alone can cure Thalia. Percy is not chosen to join the quest (Clarisse wins again) and so sets out with Annabeth, Grover and Tyson (who is reluctantly accepted) to prove that he is not a flash-in-the-plan hero. The quest has many pitfalls and ultimately Percy proves himself, discovers his true abilities and learns much about accepting people for themselves, faults and all.**End Spoilers**There are some very funny moments in the film with mythological characters. The cab ride with the Stygian Witches behind the wheel was great fun as was seeing Stanley Tucci playing Dionysus, who is being punished by Zeus by turning his wine into water. Hermes (played by Nathan Fillion) has his own package delivery business.  The one bizarre element in the film was a group of Confederate soldier zombies that are helping Clarisse. The scene where Percy consults the Oracle of Apollo was effectively spooky. The film is a great adventure for the family, appealing to both adults and children.

1557340,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B008JFUNTG,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[1, 2]","PERCY JACKSON: SEA OF MONSTERS (Dir. Thor Freudenthal, hilarious name and sounds satirical, doesn't it, Prod. Chris Columbus, 2013, 106 minutes) is the much-dreaded (by me, anyway) sequel toPercy Jackson & The Olympians: The Lightning Thief(see my review) ~This has still less charm than the original film and being taken from a series of novels, I suspect we'll be in for at least two more films. Torture.Percy Jackson (Logan Lerman, a/k/a Lehrman, whose star seems not to be rising fast enough yet still cute as a button) runs off on a quest for the Golden Fleece to heal a tree that has a surprise at its roots. Sadly, the blonde creep from the original film (Jake Abel as Luke) is back and also wants the Fleece to resurrect Kronos (a/k/a Chronos)--a very bad idea.Instead of paying any real attention to the actors, my review, like this film, will basically ignore them and move right to the bad stuff. In the first place, I can hardly fathom how a director can be so awful that NO ONE in the film matters at all. The hyperkinetic scenes are not badly done, but they are shoddy and quickly abandoned. In fact, everything in this film is shoddy and quickly abandoned.This whole film was obviously rushed in spite of flawless CGI. What with popular demand, studio pressure and schedules, I can't actually think of who to blame except the studio. When you begin to watch a film only for one thing (in my case it was for the scenes with Douglas Smith as the cyclops Tyson) or else totally look away and are content to half-listen to it, it has to be bad. The worst part of it is that the movie need not have been so awful.Shame on the people who did this, in the same way they ruined Sam Worthington's turn as Perseus with a sequel--this film deserves my least favorite label, ""NYQUEL"" (a rotten sequel that puts you to sleep, my term, don't steal it). Aside from exactly two scenes that show a sophisticated humor and some glimmer of a promise of what this might have been, umm, forget it.... and did I mention the worst thing about the JACKSON series (oh, Lord, I dreaded the day would come) is that it completely/shamelessly rips off the HARRY POTTER films? Well, it does.Now for a few words about the one individual in a bad film that I particularly love to hate, the director. Freudenthal is best known forDiary Of A Wimpy Kidwhich I didn't see. He is a short-film director and it shows big time in JACKSON. Why Columbus did not direct it or persuade Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n to do so is beyond me.Now for my personal likes: the return of Grover the satyr (the equally beautiful Brandon Jackson) plus the addition of Percy's cyclops half-brother Tyson (a cute Douglas Smith whom at first I thought was Lerman in a double role). Canadian actor Smith you may recognize from 2008'sCitizen Duane(2008) Douglas Smith; Devon Bostick; Jane McGregor, a Canadian sleeper favorite of mine--or you may know him from TV.Two stars--one for the effort and one for the effects--is all I am willing to give this stinkfest.Stanley Tucci as Dionysus (which incidentally was my great-grandfather's name) as he pours wine and it changes to water: ""You know, the Christians' god can do this in reverse ... now THERE'S a GOD!""",2,"Percy Jackson and the Sea of Jollywood's ""Nyquel"" Monsters",1390953600,"01 29, 2014",2014,3207,"['PERCY', 'JACKSON', 'SEA', 'MONSTERS', 'Dir', 'Thor', 'Freudenthal', 'hilarious', 'name', 'satirical', ""n't"", 'Prod', 'Chris', 'Columbus', '2013', '106', 'minutes', 'much-dreaded', 'anyway', 'sequel', 'toPercy', 'Jackson', 'Olympians', 'Lightning', 'Thief', 'see', 'review', '~This', 'still', 'less', 'charm', 'original', 'film', 'being', 'taken', 'series', 'novels', 'suspect', ""'ll"", 'be', 'least', 'two', 'more', 'films', 'Torture.Percy', 'Jackson', 'Logan', 'Lerman', 'a/k/a', 'Lehrman', 'star', 'not', 'be', 'rising', 'fast', 'enough', 'yet', 'still', 'cute', 'button', 'off', 'quest', 'Golden', 'Fleece', 'heal', 'tree', 'surprise', 'roots', 'Sadly', 'blonde', 'creep', 'original', 'film', 'Jake', 'Abel', 'Luke', 'back', 'also', 'Fleece', 'resurrect', 'Kronos', 'a/k/a', 'Chronos', 'very', 'bad', 'idea.Instead', 'paying', 'real', 'attention', 'actors', 'review', 'film', 'will', 'basically', 'ignore', 'move', 'right', 'bad', 'stuff', 'first', 'place', 'can', 'hardly', 'fathom', 'how', 'director', 'can', 'be', 'so', 'awful', 'ONE', 'film', 'matters', 'hyperkinetic', 'scenes', 'are', 'not', 'badly', 'done', 'are', 'shoddy', 'quickly', 'abandoned', 'fact', 'everything', 'film', 'shoddy', 'quickly', 'abandoned.This', 'whole', 'film', 'was', 'obviously', 'rushed', 'spite', 'flawless', 'CGI', 'What', 'popular', 'demand', 'studio', 'pressure', 'schedules', 'ca', ""n't"", 'actually', 'think', 'who', 'blame', 'studio', 'When', 'begin', 'watch', 'film', 'only', 'one', 'thing', 'case', 'was', 'scenes', 'Douglas', 'Smith', 'cyclops', 'Tyson', 'else', 'totally', 'look', 'away', 'are', 'content', 'half-listen', 'be', 'bad', 'worst', 'part', 'movie', 'need', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'awful.Shame', 'people', 'who', 'did', 'same', 'way', 'ruined', 'Sam', 'Worthington', 'turn', 'Perseus', 'sequel', 'film', 'least', 'favorite', 'label', 'NYQUEL', 'rotten', 'sequel', 'sleep', 'term', 'do', ""n't"", 'steal', 'Aside', 'exactly', 'two', 'scenes', 'show', 'sophisticated', 'humor', 'glimmer', 'promise', 'what', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'umm', 'forget', 'did', 'mention', 'worst', 'thing', 'JACKSON', 'series', 'oh', 'Lord', 'dreaded', 'day', 'would', 'come', 'completely/shamelessly', 'HARRY', 'POTTER', 'films', 'Well', 'few', 'words', 'one', 'individual', 'bad', 'film', 'particularly', 'love', 'hate', 'director', 'Freudenthal', 'best', 'known', 'forDiary', 'A', 'Wimpy', 'Kidwhich', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'short-film', 'director', 'big', 'time', 'JACKSON', 'Why', 'Columbus', 'did', 'not', 'direct', 'persuade', 'Alfonso', 'Cuar', 'oacute', 'do', 'so', 'me.Now', 'personal', 'likes', 'return', 'Grover', 'satyr', 'equally', 'beautiful', 'Brandon', 'Jackson', 'addition', 'Percy', 'cyclops', 'half-brother', 'Tyson', 'cute', 'Douglas', 'Smith', 'whom', 'first', 'thought', 'was', 'Lerman', 'double', 'role', 'Canadian', 'actor', 'Smith', 'may', 'recognize', ""2008'sCitizen"", 'Duane', '2008', 'Douglas', 'Smith', 'Devon', 'Bostick', 'Jane', 'McGregor', 'Canadian', 'sleeper', 'favorite', 'mine', 'may', 'know', 'TV.Two', 'stars', 'one', 'effort', 'one', 'effects', 'am', 'willing', 'give', 'stinkfest.Stanley', 'Tucci', 'Dionysus', 'incidentally', 'was', 'great-grandfather', 'name', 'wine', 'water', 'know', 'Christians', 'god', 'can', 'do', 'reverse', 'now', 'THERE', 'GOD']",N/A

This genre of film has gotten so ridiculously predictable that if you've seen Harry Potter, you've essentially already seen the Twilight films and so on and so forth.  Seriously, how many different stories can possibly be told about the ""chosen one?""  Each and every one of these films, including a beloved franchise like Star Wars, recycles the same old story about prophecy and destiny to the point that you'd think these authors and filmmakers would be tired of making stories about the same old thing.  Come to think of it, it's no wonder authors, like J.K. Rowling, Stephanie Meyer, and Rick Riordan, have all been named in plagiarism lawsuits in recent years.  When everyone's stories look alike, sound alike, and end alike - what did they expect to happen?  And, speaking of recycled stories - Percy Jackson is back with the film series' second installment, Percy Jackson: Sea of Monsters.Based on the novel of the same name (by Rick Riordan), Percy Jackson: Sea of Monsters is directed by Thor Freudenthal (Diary of a Wimpy Kid) and stars Logan Lerman as Percy Jackson - the demigod son of Poseidon.  An attack penetrates the walls of Camp Half-Blood, forcing Percy, his newfound Cyclops half-brother, Tyson (Douglas Smith), and his friends, Grover (Brandon T. Jackson) and Annabeth (Alexandra Daddario), to leave the camp on a mission to retrieve the Golden Fleece to restore the mystical barrier.  Meanwhile, Percy's former friend and current nemesis, Luke (Jake Abel), has his own plans as he and his followers are also on a mission to secure the fleece.  Leven Rambin, Stanley Tucci, Nathan Fillion, and Anthony Head also star in supporting roles.In all honesty, Percy Jackson & the Olympians: The Lightning Thief provided a great deal of entertainment - incorporating the gods of Greek mythology into present day.  While the first Percy Jackson film greatly resembled the events of the early Harry Potter films, the Percy Jackson character still had a great deal to offer regardless of the easy comparisons.  Like Potter, Jackson struggled with the idea that the world was full of mythical beings, along with the weight of being the ""chosen one.""  Also like Potter, he relied heavily on his friends to help guide him through his journey and to help him become this potentially great leader of ""destiny.""  Unfortunately, the main problems with Percy Jackson is he's not as popular as Harry Potter, doesn't have the drive or ambition of Frodo, and his sword isn't as cool as a lightsaber.  And frankly, his sidekicks - Grover and Annabeth - are not nearly as loveable as Ron and Hermione.On paper, Percy Jackson: Sea of Monsters provides a solid, well thought out storyline.  The idea of Percy Jackson being challenged again after the showdown in New York is an inevitable occurrence, but the problem with the sequel is that he was challenged too much in the first film and not challenged enough in the sequel.  In the first film, there's a massively threatening potential from the Greek gods to go to war with one another.  Let's be honest, the second film's plot relies solely on the journey to acquire a blanket.  That's right - the majority of this film follows these powerful characters as they travel across the United States to find a blanket, which happens to be resting on the shoulder of a giant, grumpy Cyclops - who lives in an amusement park.  The last film had lightning, gods, and a trip to Hades, while this sequel has absurd, blind taxi drivers, followed by an eventual trip to the oceanic version of the Pit of Sarlacc (from Return of the Jedi for those that don't know).  Sadly, there's no Boba Fett - or Amelia Earhart, in the belly of this water-based beast.Most (not all) bad movies at least have a few positives to admire.  Although admiration probably isn't the right word to use, but in any event, this film does have an early visit from a pretty sweet Transformer-like bull that shoots fire and does some major damage to Camp Half-Blood.  When Michael Bay gets a look at this thing, he'll probably wish he would have thought of it first - possibly having it transform from a Red Bull delivery truck (after all, product placement and transformers go hand-in-hand).  Aside from the bull, this sequel is also paid a visit from not one, but two Buffy: The Vampire Slayer alums.  Anthony Head takes over for the inexplicably absent Pierce Brosnan in the role of Chiron and Nathan Fillion plays the role of Hermes, the messenger of the gods who poses amusingly as a glorified UPS clerk.  Regardless, it would appear someone in the casting department has some deep admiration for Joss Whedon.It's clear the Percy Jackson novels have a substantial fan base, and 99 percent of the time, a film is unable to fully grasp the emotion of a novel.  The knock on this film has nothing to do with the novels, which have attained their own praise and devotion.  Still, it's painfully obvious this film sequel bumbles around from beginning to end, feeling unorganized and at times - just downright fake.  The CGI in the film is nothing to write home about, and while the cast is moderately entertaining (due largely to the addition of the mean-spirited character work of Leven Rambin), they still cannot make up for the poorly adapted script and bad direction.  Thor Freudenthal takes over for the Harry Potter alum, Chris Columbus - and it shows.Unfortunately for the Percy Jackson film franchise, this sequel loses any kind of ""mojo"" that was built in the first film, inevitably leading to this this dreadful and at times unbearable sequel.  The addition of a female lead, a bunch of zombies, and a golden blanket are simply not enough to maintain the average level of entertainment provided in the series' predecessor.  Still, the readers of Percy Jackson are ages 10 and up, so kids will easily find more entertainment in this film than adults.  The absence of the gods, Hollywood star power - not to mention an actual sea of monsters, is detrimental to the outcome of this film.  If you haven't yet invested in this film franchise, do yourself a favor and keep it that way.  But, if you're looking to acquaint yourself with Percy Jackson - hit the books.GRADE: DFNDNreview.com",1,'Percy Jackson' sequel sinks to the bottom of the sea,1375833600,"08 7, 2013",2013,6584,"['As',

The character seemed annoyed with having to do anything, and the actor's delivery almost seemed like he was just trying to get through his lines without yawning. The first film really allowed all 3 of the main characters to be independent and shine in their own respective talents. This time round it seemed like the director was making Percy the Brain that told his limbs (his companions) what to do. Without him directing they just seemed to stand there and wait. Not the actors' fault, but there was some good talent being wasted. It was still entertaining, just as the first one was, but if they decide to do a third, they need to have Percy's character get over his whining of &#34;why me?&#34; attitude, and bring back the sense of fellowship and dependence on each other that made the first movie enjoyable.

1557366,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B008JFUNTG,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[0, 0]","Maybe I need to pick up Rick Riordan's Percy Jackson stories again, give 'em another shot. When I first started reading the series years ago, in my eyes, it suffered from the ""Well, it's no Harry Potter"" syndrome. Annabeth Chase seemed like a straight-up clone of Hermione Granger. But this movie - Percy Jackson: Sea of Monsters - won't be the decider for me. It's fairly blas&eacute; about some of its departures from the source material.In this surprising sequel - surprising, because I didn't think there'd be a sequel - Percy (Logan Lerman) is in the midst of a funk, second-guessing his demigod street cred as a hero, wondering if he was only good for one quest. Doesn't help that his dad, the Greek god Poseidon, seems to have abandoned him and that his chief rival at Camp Half-Blood, Ares's boastful offspring Clarisse (Leven Rambin), is on his case 24/7. But when the enchanted tree that safeguards Camp Half-Blood is poisoned, a quest is proposed to obtain the one remedy, the fabled Golden Fleece, a quest that can only be undertaken by Camp Half-Blood's finest heroes. So off goes Perc- wait... what?... Oh, bummer. Okay, so off goes Clarisse on her monumental mission, making her way to the terrifying Sea of Monsters (the Bermuda Triangle, to you and me).Good for Percy, he doesn't spend too much time sulking. Concern for Clarisse and her mission compels him to embark on his own expedition for the Golden Fleece, and, of course, Annabeth (Alexandra Daddario) is with him and their cautious satyr pal Grover (Brandon T. Jackson). They're unexpectedly joined by Percy's newly discovered, hobo-like half-brother Tyson (Douglas Smith). Tyson is a cyclops, a sweet oaf, and is probably my favorite character here. He exudes this appealing childlike sense of wonder, and I like the refreshing twist of Tyson's not having any emotional baggage against Percy. He genuinely appreciates having him for a brother. Conversely, it takes Percy a minute longer to appreciate Tyson.One character who doesn't give a fig about family drama is the treacherous Luke Castellan (Jake Abel). He's back and he nurses his own plans for the Golden Fleece. Note that Luke is no tree hugger.This is a 3 out of 5 star flick for me. It's enjoyable on a surface level. Seems to me that the narrative is there mostly to service the special effects. The CG stuff is mostly solid and, in spots, even imaginative. I said ""mostly"" because I did find the mechanical Colchis Bull at the start not so convincing, the Kronos rendering pretty laughable, and the goofy Chariot of Damnation - resembling a slovenly New York taxi cab - recalls the Knight Bus from Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. The young cast turns in dedicated performances; I don't really blame them (Okay, Grover is pretty grating). It's too bad they're given crap dialogue to read:- Annabeth, held captive: ""You used to be one of us!""- Luke: ""And then I woke up.""Pros:- awesome Nathan Fillion cameo- the mythical tape and the thermos of wind (Greek mythology's answer to those 007 spy gadgets)- zombie sailors- no tired sibling rivalry between Percy and Tyson- and, as always, Percy's pen that transforms into a magic swordCons:- contrived character beats- by-the-numbers plot- done-to-death themes (the quest, the prophesy, the hero of destiny, etc.)- Annabeth and Grover are pretty useless in this one- I mentioned Tyson's sense of wonder, but the film itself eschews a sense of wonder and instead oozes this sense of commercialism- lack of continuity in that Anthony Stewart Head has replaced Pierce Brosnan as Chiron and Stanley Tucci has replaced Luke Camilleri as the hedonistic Dionysus- the running gag of Dionysus' futile attempts to down the wine before it turns to water got old really fast- uber-lame climax- ""Thor Freudenthal"" should've been the name of a berserker character in the film; instead, it's the name of the directorThe DVD's bonus stuff:- Back to Camp Half-Blood - cast speaks about reuniting for the sequel (00:02:40 minutes)- It's All in the Eye - creating Tyson, Percy's cyclops half-brother (00:05:00 minutes)- 2 theatrical trailers",3,"""It wasn't easy to find.

Is this how we want our young girls to grow up: to believe they have to take care of some man's emotions and otherwise be dependent upon him for meeting their physical needs?  And the &#34;bad&#34; girl is shown as less likable because she demonstrates characteristics that would be totally acceptable in a male: she's confident, capable, and success oriented.  But instead of being shown as a strong young woman, she's masculinized, displaying the unlikable traits of a man: a swaggering, conceited jock.

There are obvious influences of other movies. If I had not seen so many trailers showing main scenes (as is the case with many movie trailers these days) it would have been better.

1557378,AYC2ROPQPNPF4,B008JFUNTG,Jaime G.,"[1, 2]","I refused to watch the Lighting Thief when it came out in theaters because I knew they had changed so much stuff from the book.  It was the same with Sea of Monsters.  However, my father, who has never read the books, wanted to see both of them and so I ended up renting them for him to watch.  I get the fact that due to time constraints, things may need to be cut or slightly altered when making a book into a movie.  But, and this is a really big but, you don't rewrite 3000 years of Greek mythology just because you don't feel like properly following the plot of the book that you are making into a movie.  And that is just the beginning of the atrocities.When the author of the highly popular, best selling, series offers to assist you on the script for the movie based on his book (as Riordan did with the Lighting Thief, he learned his lesson and did not offer again), you don't blow him off thinking that you know better.  These books have a built in fan base and altering the stories so much so you can sex things up (ahem, yes, I'm talking about Percy and Annabeth) and Hollywoodize the crap out of them to try and turn a profit, things are going to back fire.  Fans aren't stupid.  They know when things have been changed for the sake of earning a buck and it's a pretty poor buck you're trying to get them to spend.If you haven't read the books, maybe you'll be fooled into liking this.  Even my father thought this one was a bit too over the top so I doubt I'll have to succumb to renting the next one (if this even did well enough overseas to warrant a third one) and I can save myself the torture of watching Hollywood rip apart one of my favorite series.All I can say is the cursed blade isn't Percy's sword as Hollywood would have you believe.

He can (sometimes) control the seas...* Alexandra Daddario (""Percy Jackson: Lightening Thief""), Annabeth is determined to retrieve the Golden Fleece. She is sort of a Hogwarts Hermione: she READS!* Nathan Fillian (""Much Ado About Nothing"") surprises us as a UPS guy/Hermes. His son Luke is mad at him...

Music by Andrew Lockington, Cinematography by Shelly Johnson.Storyline: Camp Half-Blood is a little township where the children of Gods live in peace and harmony. This is where Percy Jackson (son of Poseidon-Greek God of the Sea) and his friends Annabeth, Grover, Luke and Tyson (Percy&#8217;s half brother) live. Long ago, a girl called Thalia, daughter of the eldest God, Zeus, sacrifices her life to protect Annabeth, Luke and Grover against a monster attack. Her death leaves her to be transformed into a pine tree and form a protection layer to the Camp. One day Luke, the great grandson of the evil Titan God Kronos, tries to revive him from his coffin through the Golden Fleece, and seeks Percy&#8217;s help, since he believes that Percy is the only living child of the eldest Gods, as per a legend of the Oracle. Percy turns down Luke&#8217;s proposal. Luke in protest, poisons Thalia&#8217;s tree and disappears. The Camp elders now know that the tree can be saved only through the Golden Fleece, which has magical powers to heal and raise the dead. Percy and his friends set out to obtain the Fleece from Polyphemus Lair in an island in the middle of the Sea of Monsters. Percy adventures to get the Fleece from the monster man and while returning is confronted by Luke. The Golden Fleece is used to raise the Kronos from his coffin, by Luke. But Percy valiantly kills the Kronos with his Riptide, a cursed blade gifted by his father. Percy and his team bring back the Golden Fleece to the Camp Half-Blood and revive the dying Thalia tree and restores the protection layer. In the process, Thalia also comes back to life due to the magical power of the Golden Fleece only to reveal her true identity and surprise everyone.Positives: An visual treat for all age groups. Though the story line is a little confusing for those who haven&#8217;t seen the first part in Percy Jackson series, one gets to enjoy the extensive graphics used and great screenplay assisted by beautiful cinematography. The visual effects are so rich and colourful that the audience is virtually carried into a different world, when watched on big screen.Negatives: The story line is confusing for those who haven&#8217;t watched the previous Percy Jackson movie &#8220;The Lightning Thief&#8221;.My rating is 4 out of 5",4,A Different World of Graphics and Entertainment,1390003200,"01 18, 2014",2014,2518,"['Directed', 'Thor', 'Freudenthal', 'Produced', 'Michael', 'Barnathan/Karen', 'Rosenfelt', 'Starring', 'Logan', 'Lerman', 'Percy', 'Jackson', 'Brandon', 'Jackson', 'Grover', 'Alexandra', 'Daddario', 'Annabeth', 'Douglas', 'Smith', 'Tyson', 'Jake', 'Abel', 'Luke', 'Music', 'Andrew', 'Lockington', 'Cinematography', 'Shelly', 'Johnson.Storyline', 'Camp', 'Half-Blood', 'little', 'township', 'where', 'children', 'Gods', 'live', 'peace', 'harmony', 'where', 'Percy', 'Jackson', 'son', 'Poseidon-Greek', 'God', 'Sea', 'friends', 'Annabeth', 'Grover', 'Luke', 'Tyson', 'Percy', '8217', 'half', 'brother', 'live', 'Long', 'ago', 'girl', 'called', 'Thalia', 'daughter', 'eldest', 'God', 'Zeus', 'life', 'protect', 'Annabeth', 'Luke', 'Grover', 'monster', 'attack', 'death', 'be', 'transformed', 'pine', 'tree', 'form', 'protection', 'layer', 'Camp', 'One', 'day', 'Luke', 'great', 'grandson', 'evil', 'Titan', 'God', 'Kronos', 'revive', 'coffin', 'Golden', 'Fleece', 'Percy', '8217', 'help', 'Percy', 'only', 'living', 'child', 'eldest', 'Gods', 'legend', 'Oracle', 'Percy', 'down', 'Luke', '8217', 's', 'proposal', 'Luke', 'protest', 'poisons', 'Thalia', '8217', 'tree', 'disappears', 'Camp', 'elders', 'now', 'know', 'tree', 'can', 'be', 'saved', 'only', 'Golden', 'Fleece', 'magical', 'powers', 'heal', 'raise', 'dead', 'Percy', 'friends', 'set', 'out', 'obtain', 'Fleece', 'Polyphemus', 'Lair', 'island', 'middle', 'Sea', 'Monsters', 'Percy', 'get', 'Fleece', 'monster', 'man', 'returning', 'confronted', 'Luke', 'Golden', 'Fleece', 'used', 'raise', 'Kronos', 'coffin', 'Luke', 'Percy', 'valiantly', 'Kronos', 'Riptide', 'cursed', 'blade', 'gifted', 'father', 'Percy', 'team', 'bring', 'back', 'Golden', 'Fleece', 'Camp', 'Half-Blood', 'revive', 'dying', 'Thalia', 'tree', 'protection', 'layer', 'process', 'Thalia', 'also', 'back', 'life', 'due', 'magical', 'power', 'Golden', 'Fleece', 'only', 'reveal', 'true', 'identity', 'surprise', 'everyone.Positives', 'visual', 'treat', 'age', 'groups', 'story', 'line', 'little', 'confusing', 'who', 'haven', '8217', 'seen', 'first', 'part', 'Percy', 'Jackson', 'series', 'one', 'enjoy', 'extensive', 'graphics', 'used', 'great', 'screenplay', 'assisted', 'beautiful', 'cinematography', 'visual', 'effects', 'are', 'so', 'rich', 'colourful', 'audience', 'virtually', 'carried', 'different', 'world', 'when', 'watched', 'big', 'screen.Negatives', 'story', 'line', 'confusing', 'who', 'haven', '8217', 'watched', 'previous', 'Percy', 'Jackson', 'movie', '8220', 'Lightning', 'Thief', '8221', 'rating', '4', '5']",N/A

""Percy Jackson"" had the chance to be close to a Harry Potter series, moviewise.  For those who read the books, they have a great broad theme (the saving of the West as personified by Ancient Greek Ideals)  the idea of the noble hero, and the same theme as the Potter books in that true friendship can overcome impossible odds in saving that which is really important.  With creative writing and a love of Greek mythology Riordan created intricate, fascinating books.  So what did the film makers do?  Jettison every good concept, storyline and character to create a Disneyfied, shallow movie that kept none of these concepts.  I could get it if they had improved some things, but no, it's a train wreck.  How could they have destroyed the character of Tyson?  ""Hey, we'll change Tyson from a homeless slow of speech fine artisan who is taken in by Percy's Mom, to a cool, goodlooking guy who's really clumsy!  And what is all this, ""Make your own destiny!"" garbage?  Annabeth would NEVER say that.  They whole idea of ancient Greek stories is that everyone has a destiny they are bound to, like the ""Fates""! (Oops, they left out all that too!)They lost all the charm of the books, in order to create just another action/kids movie.  They could have made an entire series of all five books, and they could have been epic, like the Harry Potter ones, with heart and inspiration.  But instead they hacked and slashed their way through an great story and destroyed it, leaving out what intrigued so many people.  It's more than leaving out this scene or that.  It's losing every interesting concept that made the books special and unique.  I was so disappointed after seeing this.  Didn't they learn anything with the Narnia movies?  When you have a book with a cult following,  don't rewrite it.  Because the book is wonderful as it is and the fans just get mad.  They won't come to see any sequel.  I won't.

Marc Guggenheim (Green Lantern, Arrow) took the original novel from the very popular book series and written by Rick Riordan and did very a nice job at capturing the spirit and the heart of the story that is ""Percy Jackson - Sea of Monsters"".Logan Lerman (Stuck In Love, The Three Musketeers) reprises his role as Percy and this time his adventure is far more personal than he could have ever imagined. Percy finds out that he also has a half-brother named Tyson who happens to be a Cyclops and is wonderfully portrayed by Douglas Smith (Antiviral, The Boy Who Smells Like Fish). The two seem at odds, but Tyson innocence and sincerity really warm the hearts of everyone in the team and the audience.The team is back and it consists of the other half-humans/half-Gods like Alexandra Daddario (Texas Chainsaw 3D, Parenthood) as feisty Annabeth, Brandon T. Jackson (Thunderstruck, Raising Hope) as Grover who is a real Satyr himself and Leven Rambim (The Hunger Games, One Tree Hill) as Clarisse the over-the-top female bully of the bunch.One of the most interesting performances comes from Stanley Tucci (The Hunger Games, The Devil Wears Prada) playing Mr. D. who is the somewhat despondent caretaker of the fortress where all the Half-Gods are protected by a special tree that was made at the cost of the life of one of their own.One of the best and funniest performances comes from Nathan Fillion (Castle, Firefly) who plays Hermes, one of the original three God's first created by the Titans - the Messenger of the bunch. Nathan is obviously having way too much fun with his character in speaking about himself and his abilities and the fact that he himself has a now estranged and wayward son named Luke, another Half-God.Luke is basically the bad guy in this film, trying to assemble the original Titan who created all Gods and is played quite nasty by Jake Abel (The Host, I Am Number 4). All the kids are back with a few new ones added in the mix too.  The entire plot centers around saving the dying tree that protects the fort and stopping Luke from assembling the original Titan named Polyphemus (who is voiced by Ron Perlman (Beauty and the Beats, Hellboy)) who is pure evil and wants to destroy all the Half-Gods and the entire world and every human on it. How? He east them. Yum!There are wonderful effects including riding a wave on the ocean, a gigantic digestive system of a sea Monster as well as the creation and destruction of Polyphemus. They absolutely leave the ending open for a sequel but this film franchise has a smart heart, big story and wonderfully cast all the way around.

I have not read the books.I was very disappointed with this movie. The first movie was about his discovery that he was the son of Poseidon, and was all about his character development where predictably at the end of the movie he came into his full power to defeat the anti-hero and save the day.  Predictable, yet somewhat original with great special effects and likable characters.This movie however, contained many elements torn directly from the Illiad (The Odessy). The four winds contained in a thermos instead of a wine-bladder, yet used for the exact same purpose, to propel a ship (which would not have been necessary since there were not 1 but 2 sons of Poseidon on said boat, both with power over water).  This movie was riddled with face-palm moments where I think &#34;What's his problem, he's surrounded by water!!!&#34;.  And when he does use the water to his advantage, it seems he uses it in the most ineffective, pointless manner possible.I felt like this movie had taken all of the character development back to even before the first movie. It was all about his insecurity, where by the end of the first movie he had developed a total self-confidence and self-control. Annabel also seemed to take a backseat from the over-confident, dominant, stubborn warrior princess to Hermione from Hogwarts.

As far as the movie, I have fading memory of the first film in this series (""The Lightning Thief) of a few years ago.  I liked the premise of Greek gods coupling with humans, and in one case here with a nymph cyclops.  The offspring are known as half-bloods.Returning to the series is Logan Lerman as Percy Jackson, Brandon T. Jackson as satyr Grover and Alexandra Daddario as Annabeth.  The half-bloods live in a village protected by an invisible barrier.  The barrier is penetrated by a mechanical bull under the control of a once friend, Luke (Jake Abel) who has some idea of resurrecting the late, great god, Kronos (Robert Knepper).  In order to repair the barrier, our trio and Peter's new half-brother cyclops Tyson (Douglas Smith) and queen bee in training, Clarisse (Leven Rambin) head off in search for the Golden Fleece.A series of monsters, not to mention Luke and his gang get in their way of course.  It's been a couple days since I've seen this movie and much of the detail is beginning to fade.  So, while this is an entertaining film, it will probably be most appreciated for the younger crowd.  The thing I remember most is seeing Ms. Daddario for the first time since her role on HBO's ""True Detective"" as the no-holds-barred paramour of Woody Harrelson's character.As noted earlier, the Blu ray disc is a visual and audio delight.  With a 1080p transfer and a 2.35:1 aspect ratio, the film is quite bold with the use of color.  The CGI aspects, of which there are plenty, are a tad soft, but certainly not offensive.  The audio is where the film really shines.  The disc has a DTS HD Master Audio 7.1 audio track.  It provides a thunderous LFE channel and an aggressive surround mix.  Terrific stuff.

And I was right.&#34;Percy Jackson: Sea of Monsters&#34; is a fun and mythical adventureeveryone would love!I still did not expect so many surprises in this movie and greatlyenjoyed it! The story continues as if it was a day or a week after thefirst movie which was a good perk as well. Something else that's verycool is the fact that movie is super close to the actual book! Theadventure begins when Percy (Logan Lerman) is still at camp with hisfriends, Grover (Brandon T. Jackson) and Annabeth (Alexandra Daddario).Everything is more or less the same. There is a new girl whose name isClarisse. (Leven Rambin) She is the daughter of a human and the god ofwar. This girl is beating the heck out of Percy and she's very mean aswell. One day there's a bionic monster outside of the camp, thanks toone of the gods though, there is a shield reflecting the bionicnightmare, when the shield is broken they destroy the machine and Percydiscovers that Luke, a villain that tried to over throw the gods, isalive! Annabeth discovers that the tree producing the shield is dyingand appears to be poisoned. Annabeth, Percy, and not a very happyGrover all go on a quest to receive an artifact that can bring anythingdying to life &#8211; Golden Flees! Do you believe they can restore theshield and save their camp? You would have to watch the movie!There is so much to love about this film and maybe only one or twothings to dislike. It has comedy, action, adventure, mythical placesand items, and so much more! The maybe one thing I thought wasinteresting is that Annabeth turns into a blonde in this movie. What isinteresting than in both books Annabeth is a blond, but in the firstmovie she's not a blond, but a brunet! That was really the only thingthat confused me. The director, Thor Freudenthal did a fantastic joband so did the cast. I would have to say my favorite moment in thisfilm is when the gang calls a &#34;taxi&#34; to get them to Florida. The gangis extremely scared of the three drivers wicked driving, and it turnsout that the kids don't have enough money to get to Florida! Uh oh!I would have to recommend this film to ages 10 to 18. There is verylittle language or any adult material at all. It may be a little scaryfor younger ages though. I give this film 5 out of 5 stars because itwas simply brilliant.

Jackson,Alexandra Daddario,  Douglas Smith, Leven Rambin, Jake Abel, Stanley Tucci and Nathan Fillion.I was very pleased to see the entire production,after the first one,on a much better footing as it ended up being far better.The story finds us pretty much starting where the last one left off.If you recall, three out of four 1/2 Gods made it into the training camp alive.The one who died saving the rest was the daughter of Zeus,Thalia.What we didn't see is Thalia morphing into a living tree which in turn produced a barrier around the camp which no ordinary  enemy could penetrate.One day a young cyclops arrives to join the camp,and it turns out to be Percy's half brother(a cyclops)Tyson.Percy's girlfriend isn't too thrilled as her close friend Thalia died by a cyclops' hand.A huge brass,mechanical bull arrives to wreak havoc in the camp,penetrating the supposedly impenetrable barrier.After taking it down Luke,Hermes half son,arrives.Luke has poisoned the tree,which explains the bulls arrival.Luke tries to persuade Percy to come to his side,and mentions a quest,before he is rebuked and disappears.Percy afterwards confronts the camp leader about the quest,who sends him to the office attic.There Percy learns that it will be he that leads a group on a special quest.Back outside the camp learns the only thing that will save Thalia is the Golden Fleece.It resides on an island in the Sea of Monsters,located in the Bermuda Triangle,ruled over by the cyclops that killed Thalia,Polyphemus.To get them to Florida fast,Percy's girlfriend hails the Chariot of Damnation,piloted by the three Stygian Witches.When they profess to having not enough Drachmas to pay the ever increasing cab fare,the witches drop them off in Washington,DC. While there they look up Hermes,who is running a delivery  service,OPS(Olympus Parcel Service).He gives them a couple of items that later come in handy to them on their journey.He also asks Percy to ask his son Luke to not be so angry with the world.Leaving here they make their way to the ocean and hail a Hippocampus,a brightly coloured animal who is a cross between a sea horse and a luck dragon.The creature takes them to the yacht Luke and his posse are using to get to the island.The all get briefly captured, but thanks to  the tools Hermes gave Percy,they escape.However,the group get captured in Charybdis's whirlpool(in mythology sometimes just a whirlpool,but here a living creature)along the way,and end up in its huge stomach.While there, the group come upon the daughter of Ares,Clarisse,who was also was trying to get to the fleece,but now leads a motley crew of zombies,piloting a Vietnam era gun ship.They hop aboard and with Percy's help ,manage to free themselves from the monsters stomach.They sail away and find the island with the fleece.They enter caves there and find the fleece,guarded by the cyclops Polyphemus.They manage to wrestle the fleece away and trap the cyclops at the same time.Above ground Luke arrives and fires an arrow at Percy,which is taken by Tyson,who falls away into the water far below.While the despondent group assesses their loss,Luke uses the fleece to revive the bones of Kronos,the father of Poseidan,Ares and Zeus.Luke hopes to control Kronos,but Luke,it turns out,is the first to be eaten by Kronos.The group now must not only deal with Luke's men,but Kronos also.It is a pitched battle but in the end Percy and his friends prevail.Tyson even has come back from the&#34;dead&#34;,having been healed by the waters below.The only glitch is Percy's girlfriend,who was struck down and had to be brought back by the power of the fleece.Back at the camp they cover some of the roots of Thalia's tree with the fleece.Next day the camp is astonished to see that the fleece has not only cured the tree,but brought Thalia herself back from the dead.The film ends as we see Kronos's remains glowing inside the sarcophagus they came in.This film moves along extremely well and its special effects work for the film brilliantly.There are some wonderful moments,but two humourous ones stand out. First is the cab ride with the Stygian Witches.It's a New York yellow cab,and when it first arrives I thought Buster Poindexter from &#34;Scrooged&#34; was going to stick his face out of the window.Between the three of them,they argue and nit pick while driving with alarming speed on their journey, scaring the bejeesus out of their passengers;all the while either looking with one eye or no eye.The second instance is Nathan Fillion's portrayal as Hermes.His time on screen isn't terribly long but it is very memorable.One of the items he gives the group to assist them in their quest he says is from a favourite show of his that was&#34;cancelled&#34;.An obvious in-joke referring to his own classic &#34;Firefly&#34;.This film is obviously geared towards a teen demographic,but I found this time around,compared to the first,it doesn't shut out the older crowd as much.It can be enjoyed on many levels by a larger demo.Technically speaking the movie is in its original w/s a/r of 2:40:1 and is clear and crisp.There are no extras on this disc.Another example of the indiscriminate &#34;push&#34; to buy Blu Ray over  plain DVD.Reminding one of the change over from VHS to DVD.Do you feel like you have a ring in your nose,and you're being led around a ring by the entertainment industry?All in all this latest installment in the Percy Jackson franchise(there WILL be more),is a winner from beginning to the end.The script is well written and the  acting is top notch.It is far and away a big improvement over the first one,and one can only hope the producers are able to keep up this

Guess how that works out.The film opens with a slight monologue to reintroduce the characters. Like the Potter series, the main character's acting in the low point. This film also has that hidden world within our own world aspect. The scenes boasts wonderful special effects. The individual scenes are more overpowering than the general plot designed to appeal to the pop culture youth. Leven Rambin was made up to look like Jennifer Lawrence running around with a bow. One can't help but draw to mind the block buster films of ""Hunger Games"" and ""Potter.""This series seems designed for those slightly younger than the Potter crowd.

My review of &#8220;Percy Jackson: Sea of Monsters,&#8221; sequel to a 2010 fantasy adventure film &#8220;Percy Jackson & the Olympians: The Lightning Thief&#34; is strictly that of an avid filmgoer.As a film &#8220;Sea of Monsters&#8221; is not really that bad. The sequel has a good amount of action sequences and first-rate special effects (Colchis Bulls is pretty impressive). The film is about the new adventure of young demigod students of Camp Half-Blood, who are forced to find the legendary Golden Fleece, to revitalize the dying Thalia's tree.Logan Lerman comes back as a demigod Percy Jackson, a slightly laid-back hero with a sense of humor, who takes us through the story at a brisk pace. Brandon T. Jackson and Alexandra Daddario are okay as his friends Grover Underwood and Annabeth Chase, although I think the film could have given them more to do in the story. The same can be said about the fiercely competitive character Clarisse La Rue (Leven Rambin), demigod daughter of Ares, who could have been more interesting with a well-written backstory. Perhaps I should have read the books.Adult supporting actors include Stanley Tucci as &#8220;Mr. D&#8221; or Dionysus, and Nathan Fillion as Hermes. They are very effective comic relief, but even these talents can do little in a story that may be predictable for the fans of the genre. Director Thor Freudenthal (&#8220;Hotel for Dogs&#8221; &#8220;Diary of a Wimpy Kid&#8221;), who replaced Chris Columbus (who served as a producer here), did a serviceable job in continuing Percy Jackson&#8217;s story that somewhat starts to look familiar, but still entertaining.After all the sequel is fairly good, even though it has little to add to the popular genre of fantasy movies.",3,Familiar But Enjoyable,1385164800,"11 23, 2013",2013,1845,"['First', 'must', 'confess', 'haven', '8217', 'read', 'original', 'series', 'written', 'Rick', 'Riordan', 'My', 'review', '8220', 'Percy', 'Jackson', 'Sea', 'Monsters', '8221', 'sequel', '2010', 'fantasy', 'adventure', 'film', '8220', 'Percy', 'Jackson', 'Olympians', 'Lightning', 'Thief', '34', 'strictly', 'avid', 'filmgoer.As', 'film', '8220', 'Sea', 'Monsters', '8221', 'not', 'really', 'bad', 'sequel', 'good', 'amount', 'action', 'sequences', 'first-rate', 'special', 'effects', 'Colchis', 'Bulls', 'pretty', 'impressive', 'film', 'new', 'adventure', 'young', 'demigod', 'students', 'Camp', 'Half-Blood', 'who', 'are', 'forced', 'find', 'legendary', 'Golden', 'Fleece', 'revitalize', 'dying', 'Thalia', 'tree.Logan', 'Lerman', 'back', 'demigod', 'Percy', 'Jackson', 'slightly', 'laid-back', 'hero', 'sense', 'humor', 'who', 'story', 'brisk', 'pace', 'Brandon', 'T.', 'Jackson', 'Alexandra', 'Daddario', 'are', 'okay', 'friends', 'Grover', 'Underwood', 'Annabeth', 'Chase', 'think', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'given', 'more', 'do', 'story', 'same', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'fiercely', 'competitive', 'character', 'Clarisse', 'La', 'Rue', 'Leven', 'Rambin', 'demigod', 'daughter', 'Ares', 'who', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'interesting', 'well-written', 'backstory', 'Perhaps', 'should', 'have', 'read', 'books.Adult', 'supporting', 'actors', 'include', 'Stanley', 'Tucci', '8220', 'Mr.', 'D', '8221', 'Dionysus', 'Nathan', 'Fillion', 'Hermes', 'are', 'very', 'effective', 'comic', 'relief', 'even', 'talents', 'can', 'do', 'little', 'story', 'may', 'be', 'predictable', 'fans', 'genre', 'Director', 'Thor', 'Freudenthal', '8220', 'Hotel', 'Dogs', '8221', '8220', 'Diary', 'Wimpy', 'Kid', '8221', 'who', 'replaced', 'Chris', 'Columbus', 'who', 'served', 'producer', 'here', 'did', 'serviceable', 'job', 'continuing', 'Percy', 'Jackson', '8217', 'story', 'somewhat', 'look', 'familiar', 'still', 'entertaining.After', 'sequel', 'fairly', 'good', 'even', 'little', 'add', 'popular', 'genre', 'fantasy', 'movies']",N/A

I am a great fan of the Percy Jackson series due to the exciting and often amusing writing and also due to the mythological aspects of the stories.  I also like Logan Lerman a lot (who is really much too old for Percy).I was prepared to go see 'Sea of Monsters' several times, but after the first 45 minutes, I was sorry to sit through the rest of it.  The movie storyline departed from the book significantly in favor of a slam-bang ending that made no sense.  Moreover, Percy is supposed to be a HERO.  Here he was a wimp moaning about his failures - give me a break!  In addition, Logan Lerman seemed to phone his acting in - and based on his interviews which showed that he spent little time working on this film, that's exactly what he did.Lastly the production values weren't particularly good.  If they would spend even half the amount they've spent on the Potter or Hunger Games films, they might have had a hit on their hands.  As it is, I seriously hope these producers won't do another Jackson film.  Stick to the books is my advice.",2,Poor & Disappointing,1388448000,"12 31, 2013",2013,1188,"['hate', 'disagree', 'others', 'here', 'thought', 'was', 'poorly', 'done', 'sequel', 'first', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'great', 'am', 'great', 'fan', 'Percy', 'Jackson', 'series', 'due', 'exciting', 'often', 'amusing', 'writing', 'also', 'due', 'mythological', 'aspects', 'stories', 'also', 'like', 'Logan', 'Lerman', 'lot', 'who', 'really', 'much', 'too', 'old', 'Percy', '.I', 'was', 'prepared', 'go', 'see', ""'Sea"", 'Monsters', 'several', 'times', 'first', '45', 'minutes', 'was', 'sorry', 'sit', 'rest', 'movie', 'storyline', 'departed', 'book', 'significantly', 'favor', 'slam-bang', 'ending', 'made', 'sense', 'Moreover', 'Percy', 'supposed', 'be', 'HERO', 'Here', 'was', 'wimp', 'moaning', 'failures', 'give', 'break', 'addition', 'Logan', 'Lerman', 'seemed', 'phone', 'acting', 'based', 'interviews', 'showed', 'spent', 'little', 'time', 'working', 'film', 'exactly', 'what', 'did.Lastly', 'production', 'values', 'were', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'good', 'would', 'spend', 'even', 'amount', ""'ve"", 'spent', 'Potter', 'Hunger', 'Games', 'films', 'might', 'have', 'had', 'hit', 'hands', 'seriously', 'hope', 'producers', 'wo', ""n't"", 'do', 'Jackson', 'film', 'Stick', 'books', 'advice']",N/A
