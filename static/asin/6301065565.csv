Sonia Braga (STREETS OF LAREDO) stars as a mechanic in the farmer's New Mexico pueblo who supports the farmer and joins the ""war"" against the real estate developer who cares about nothing but himself and his profits. Ultimately the townspeople and the developers square off.  You'll love the ""hombre angel"" that keeps popping up.Enchantingly written THE MILAGRO BEANFIELD WAR is a wonderful film.  Frankly, I'm surprised that it doesn't have a stronger following. A great cast includes Ruben Blades as the sheriff and Christopher Walken as a corrupt state police officer.

This movie touched my heart in many ways not the least of which it's fictional town Milagro was filmed around the area of Truchas New Mexico which is not far from where I was born in Santa Fe New Mexico.  The story is a story that can be happening in the littlest of towns in New Mexico to the littlest towns anywhere.  It tells of over development and all horrors that come with it under the guise improvement.  The big guns in all these ""improvements"" in any areas are only concerned about themselves and how much money they are going to make they are not worried about the smaller man.  This is a delightful story with humorous insights into real small town life.  I can't think of one character that did not add something to this movie even Amarante's pig Lopita (except in the book it was Pacheco's pig).  This book and movie is not an old movie in the sense of a classic movie but it should be put in that category of a classic.  The tale is just as pertinent today as when it was written.

244509,A3UKT2ERYBGOWL,6301065565,D. GORR,"[8, 8]","Since the medium was first introduced, I've been waiting (were it applicable for me, I'd say praying, on bended knee) for Milagro to appear on DVD. This movie easily ranks among the top entries in my ""desert island"" must-haves. To be honest, I never held out much hope that it would ever happen. The release of this title on DVD is one of the most pleasant surprises in recent memory, almost  enough to make me religious -- ""Thank you God for granting me another day!""Nichol's work, after his successful novel ""The Sterile Cuckoo"" (made into a movie starring a very young Lisa Minelli) and his subsequent move to northern New Mexico, took a turn that was politically anathema to some (increasingly leftist), but his passion for the land and for the people transcends the realm of the political and becomes something spiritual -- hence, the name, Milagro, which means miracle. Even if you can't identify politically, this is one of the most beautiful cinematic presentations I've seen, and it's drenched in humanity.Prior to Redford's movie interpretation, I was already a total Nichols fan. His New Mexico Trilogy -- The Milagro Beanfield War (1974), The Magic Journey (1978), and The Nirvana Blues (1981) -- was a heartfelt take on the northern New Mexico socioscape of indigenous people suffering in the wake of encroaching money and development from major American population centers. Rich people, searching for escapes, retreats, and vacation homes in the gorgeous Western hinterland, have been displacing the long-time residents of those hinterlands for decades. Nichol's books take on the viewpoint of the people dispossessed and disenfranchised. The theme still resonates today wherever the powerless are pushed aside for new development, vacation estates/ranchettes, or a new golf course. The last paragraph of ""Nirvana Blues"" confirms Nichol's digust with America's disregard for the powerless. His main character dreams of going to a better place, a place where people are respected, honest work is respected, and wealth doesn't rule absolutely -- in Nichol's 1981 vision, this means Cuba: ""Yet Joe remained intact, and continued falling toward the green hills and succulent valleys of a Communist country.""Today, of course, it wouldn't be politic to make such a statement. As a political entity, communism has been pronounced a failure (Ronnie Reagan, early to mid 80s), and, by extension, ANY and ALL social concepts like the rights of each and every member of a given society have fallen into disrepute. After all, we live in George Bush's America ... now that I think about it, the message of the New Mexico Trilogy is more relevant today than it has been at any time since 1981. Ultimately, Nichol's work is about protecting the rights of the common man in the face of political and monied interests. I ain't no rich man's son, and I can identify. If you've ever experienced a feeling of creeping social vulnerability, of being overrun by irresistable forces, of being dispassionately cast aside, check out this movie, and better yet, read the three books in Nichol's New Mexico Trilogy. They're all about people, the land, and real compassion.They're also very rich reads, produced by a highly skilled wordsmith.I don't know how involved you were in the production of this DVD, but thank you VERY MUCH Robert Redford for making the release of this movie to DVD a reality.Oh, I forgot to mention that the soundtrack is magical. My wife and I have been hoping that it would make it to CD at some point, but that's probably WAY too much to hope for. (Hey, Mr. Redford, what are the chances? Maybe just make the tracks downloadable on iTunes?)",5,It's a Milagro,1127001600,"09 18, 2005",2005,3655,"['medium', 'was', 'first', 'introduced', ""'ve"", 'been', 'waiting', 'were', 'applicable', ""'d"", 'say', 'praying', 'bended', 'knee', 'Milagro', 'appear', 'DVD', 'movie', 'easily', 'top', 'entries', 'desert', 'island', 'must-haves', 'be', 'honest', 'never', 'held', 'out', 'much', 'hope', 'would', 'ever', 'happen', 'release', 'title', 'DVD', 'one', 'most', 'pleasant', 'surprises', 'recent', 'memory', 'almost', 'enough', 'make', 'religious', 'God', 'granting', 'day', 'Nichol', 'work', 'successful', 'novel', 'Sterile', 'Cuckoo', 'made', 'movie', 'starring', 'very', 'young', 'Lisa', 'Minelli', 'subsequent', 'move', 'northern', 'New', 'Mexico', 'took', 'turn', 'was', 'politically', 'anathema', 'increasingly', 'leftist', 'passion', 'land', 'people', 'realm', 'political', 'something', 'spiritual', 'hence', 'name', 'Milagro', 'miracle', 'Even', 'ca', ""n't"", 'identify', 'politically', 'one', 'most', 'beautiful', 'cinematic', 'presentations', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'drenched', 'humanity.Prior', 'Redford', 'movie', 'interpretation', 'was', 'already', 'total', 'Nichols', 'fan', 'New', 'Mexico', 'Trilogy', 'Milagro', 'Beanfield', 'War', '1974', 'Magic', 'Journey', '1978', 'Nirvana', 'Blues', '1981', 'was', 'heartfelt', 'take', 'northern', 'New', 'Mexico', 'socioscape', 'indigenous', 'people', 'suffering', 'wake', 'encroaching', 'money', 'development', 'major', 'American', 'population', 'centers', 'Rich', 'people', 'searching', 'escapes', 'retreats', 'vacation', 'homes', 'gorgeous', 'Western', 'hinterland', 'have', 'been', 'displacing', 'long-time', 'residents', 'hinterlands', 'decades', 'Nichol', 'books', 'take', 'viewpoint', 'people', 'dispossessed', 'disenfranchised', 'theme', 'still', 'today', 'powerless', 'are', 'pushed', 'aside', 'new', 'development', 'vacation', 'estates/ranchettes', 'new', 'golf', 'course', 'last', 'paragraph', 'Nirvana', 'Blues', 'Nichol', 'digust', 'America', 'disregard', 'powerless', 'main', 'character', 'dreams', 'going', 'better', 'place', 'place', 'where', 'people', 'are', 'respected', 'honest', 'work', 'respected', 'wealth', ""n't"", 'rule', 'absolutely', 'Nichol', '1981', 'vision', 'Cuba', 'Joe', 'remained', 'intact', 'continued', 'falling', 'green', 'hills', 'succulent', 'valleys', 'Communist', 'country', 'Today', 'course', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'politic', 'make', 'such', 'statement', 'political', 'entity', 'communism', 'been', 'pronounced', 'failure', 'Ronnie', 'Reagan', 'early', 'mid', '80s', 'extension', 'ANY', 'ALL', 'social', 'concepts', 'rights', 'member', 'given', 'society', 'have', 'fallen', 'disrepute', 'live', 'George', 'Bush', 'America', 'now', 'think', 'message', 'New', 'Mexico', 'Trilogy', 'more', 'relevant', 'today', 'been', 'time', '1981', 'Ultimately', 'Nichol', 'work', 'protecting', 'rights', 'common', 'man', 'face', 'political', 'monied', 'interests', 'ai', ""n't"", 'rich', 'man', 'son', 'can', 'identify', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'experienced', 'feeling', 'creeping', 'social', 'vulnerability', 'being', 'overrun', 'irresistable', 'forces', 'being', 'dispassionately', 'cast', 'aside', 'check', 'out', 'movie', 'better', 'yet', 'read', 'three', 'books', 'Nichol', 'New', 'Mexico', 'Trilogy', ""'re"", 'people', 'land', 'real', 'compassion.They', ""'re"", 'also', 'very', 'rich', 'reads', 'produced', 'highly', 'skilled', 'wordsmith.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'involved', 'were', 'production', 'DVD', 'VERY', 'MUCH', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'making', 'release', 'movie', 'DVD', 'reality.Oh', 'forgot', 'mention', 'soundtrack', 'magical', 'wife', 'have', 'been', 'hoping', 'would', 'make', 'CD', 'point', 'probably', 'WAY', 'too', 'much', 'hope', 'Hey', 'Mr.', 'Redford', 'are', 'chances', 'Maybe', 'just', 'make', 'tracks', 'downloadable', 'iTunes']",Milagro Beanfield War VHS
244510,ADS5APY1NKTL4,6301065565,"D. Pawl ""Dani""","[6, 6]","THE MILAGRO BEANFIELD WAR was a wonderfully orchestrated, directed and overlooked film by Robert Redford.  It truly showcases magical realism, a style of storytelling often depicted in Latin American tales, LIKE WATER FOR CHOCOLATE, a novel written by Laura Esquivel and brought to the screen by Alfonso Arau, being another great example. Essentially, magical realism is an artistic genre in which magical elements appear in an otherwise realistic setting. When done well in film, the viewer transported to another space and time where there nothing is impossible.This great story take place in a small New Mexican town (I am not exaggerating when I say ""small,"" either.  The population is 500 and many of the residents acquire their livelihood from the land, in the beanfields, to be specific).  All of that is about to be challenged by stealthy land developers who want to destroy the rich and pliable earth, to construct golf courses and other more Yuppified, upper-middle class attractions.  There is one man who plans to stand his ground in the face of developers (and even bulldozers).  That man is Joe Mondragon (Chick Vennera).  What's more, Amarante, the elder of the town (Carlos Riquelme), who has been written off as crazy, speaks to the angels (people who knew and lived in the town long before the developers were even a glimmer in their parent's eyes).  This also co-stars Christopher Walken, as the token ""bad guy"" (a typecast he has become all to well-known for), Sonia Braga, Ruben Blades and Daniel Stern.Magical realism comes into play in many respects.  For example, Amarante's dialogue with the angels is very real and common place for the elderly man, but a form of insanity to his neighbors.  Also, the line between incident and fate gets progressively blurred, after an accident occurs.  I don't want to ruin it for you, so, you'll just have to see it for yourself.  This film is humorous, intelligent and very well-done.  I think you'll enjoy it, too.",5,such a great and memorable film......,1181692800,"06 13, 2007",2007,1977,"['MILAGRO', 'BEANFIELD', 'WAR', 'was', 'wonderfully', 'orchestrated', 'directed', 'overlooked', 'film', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'truly', 'magical', 'realism', 'style', 'storytelling', 'often', 'depicted', 'Latin', 'American', 'tales', 'LIKE', 'WATER', 'FOR', 'CHOCOLATE', 'novel', 'written', 'Laura', 'Esquivel', 'brought', 'screen', 'Alfonso', 'Arau', 'being', 'great', 'example', 'Essentially', 'magical', 'realism', 'artistic', 'genre', 'magical', 'elements', 'appear', 'otherwise', 'realistic', 'setting', 'When', 'done', 'well', 'film', 'viewer', 'transported', 'space', 'time', 'where', 'there', 'nothing', 'impossible.This', 'great', 'story', 'take', 'place', 'small', 'New', 'Mexican', 'town', 'am', 'not', 'exaggerating', 'when', 'say', 'small', 'population', '500', 'many', 'residents', 'acquire', 'livelihood', 'land', 'beanfields', 'be', 'specific', 'be', 'challenged', 'stealthy', 'land', 'developers', 'who', 'want', 'destroy', 'rich', 'pliable', 'earth', 'construct', 'golf', 'courses', 'other', 'more', 'Yuppified', 'upper-middle', 'class', 'attractions', 'one', 'man', 'who', 'stand', 'ground', 'face', 'developers', 'even', 'bulldozers', 'man', 'Joe', 'Mondragon', 'Chick', 'Vennera', 'What', 'more', 'Amarante', 'elder', 'town', 'Carlos', 'Riquelme', 'who', 'been', 'written', 'off', 'crazy', 'angels', 'people', 'who', 'knew', 'lived', 'town', 'long', 'developers', 'were', 'even', 'glimmer', 'parent', 'eyes', 'also', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'token', 'bad', 'guy', 'typecast', 'become', 'well-known', 'Sonia', 'Braga', 'Ruben', 'Blades', 'Daniel', 'Stern.Magical', 'realism', 'play', 'many', 'respects', 'example', 'Amarante', 'dialogue', 'angels', 'very', 'real', 'common', 'place', 'elderly', 'man', 'form', 'insanity', 'neighbors', 'Also', 'line', 'incident', 'fate', 'progressively', 'blurred', 'accident', 'occurs', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'ruin', 'so', ""'ll"", 'just', 'have', 'see', 'film', 'humorous', 'intelligent', 'very', 'well-done', 'think', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'too']",Milagro Beanfield War VHS

244529,A36EW68H08UOCS,6301065565,"Mark J. Fowler ""Let's Play Two!""","[2, 2]","Robert Redford's 2nd film is a noble effort.  ""The Milagro Beanfield War"" is adapted from John Treadwell Nichols novel, which I must admit I have not read.  In the accompanying documentary Redford tells us that the book was more sprawling with more characters and subplots.  His film is just about right.While watching I was reminded of the writings of Gabriel Garcia Marquez, full of passion and the supernatural in a way that seems perfectly natural.  For example, the film opens showing us a Mexican dancing through the community of Milagro during sunrise.  This old man then has a conversation with Amarante, the oldest citizen of Milagro.  It wasn't until some time later that I picked up on the fact that the old Mexican is an Angel. Amarante is the only one who can see and carry on conversations with him.  In a ""Hollywood"" movie this might be the entire plot - man ""sees"" an Angel no one else can see.  But in this story the ""Angel"" subplot is just one of many colorful textures added to a rich storyline.The story is one of ""rich vs poor"".  The Milagro residents have lived there for centuries, and though they were never wealthy they made do in their community.  Wealthy developers are coming to build a community of luxury for those who can pay, and will want a golf course where bean fields now stand.Characters are not black and white in this story - much like real-life - and the story is enriched by added subtle shades to many complex characters.  Chick Vennera portrays Joe Mondragon, a Mexican whose father left him one of the proudest bean fields of Milagro, now dried up due to lack of irrigation.  The water has been diverted by the rich developers - who have the means to MAKE water flow to their development.  The irrigation ditch runs right beside the bean field and one day out of frustration at lack of work Joe kicks a valve that diverts part of the water to his father's bean field.  Everyone in Milagro immediately senses the significance of the water.  The water ""belongs"" to Mr. Devine and his developers.  But the water is also all the is keeping Milagro from it's former agricultural glory.Ruby, played by Sonia Braga, runs an auto body shop, where honest work is done.  But she knows that her mechanics don't have the expertise to work on the new Mercedes and Jaguars that will be coming into town if the rich developers have their way.  John Heard has a great understated role as Charlie Bloom, a lawyer who was once a political activist, but who is now in Milagro.  It seems he came there to avoid waves.  Now he runs a paper that only comes out every couple of days.  Ruby pressures Charlie into joining the cause against the developers, and the sequence around a town meeting that Ruby calls is one of the highlights of the movie.  Ruby first invites reluctant Charlie to the meeting to cover it for his paper.  But once the group is assembled she calls him up as a lawyer expert to explain to the people WHY it's important that Milagro not be turned into high-priced real estate.  The scene is masterful story-telling and some of the most clever exposition of any film.  Charlie explains plainly that once the rich folks move in they'll demand better schools, better public works and finally the families that have lived in Milagro for 500 years won't be able to afford the taxes of their own community.Ruben Blades is great as Sheriff Montoya, perhaps the coolest head in Milagro.  Several times during the story there is a standoff with folks aiming guns at one another, only to have the Sheriff calm the situation down.  The great character actor James Gannon portrays Shorty, who is employed by the developers, but is also sympathetic to the natives as well.Daniel Stern portrays a college boy and Christopher Walken is a menacing lawman in effective performances.The magic in Milagro comes from Redford's willingness to let the story unfold, painting the town and the unique characters in warm strokes that are believable and engaging.",4,Robert Redford's Magical Tale of the Land,1121040000,"07 11, 2005",2005,3980,"['Robert', 'Redford', '2nd', 'film', 'noble', 'effort', 'Milagro', 'Beanfield', 'War', 'adapted', 'John', 'Treadwell', 'Nichols', 'novel', 'must', 'admit', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'accompanying', 'documentary', 'Redford', 'book', 'was', 'more', 'sprawling', 'more', 'characters', 'subplots', 'film', 'just', 'about', 'right.While', 'watching', 'was', 'reminded', 'writings', 'Gabriel', 'Garcia', 'Marquez', 'full', 'passion', 'supernatural', 'way', 'perfectly', 'natural', 'example', 'film', 'showing', 'Mexican', 'dancing', 'community', 'Milagro', 'sunrise', 'old', 'man', 'then', 'conversation', 'Amarante', 'oldest', 'citizen', 'Milagro', 'was', ""n't"", 'time', 'later', 'picked', 'up', 'fact', 'old', 'Mexican', 'Angel', 'Amarante', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'can', 'see', 'carry', 'conversations', 'Hollywood', 'movie', 'might', 'be', 'entire', 'plot', 'man', 'sees', 'Angel', 'one', 'else', 'can', 'see', 'story', 'Angel', 'subplot', 'just', 'one', 'many', 'colorful', 'textures', 'added', 'rich', 'storyline.The', 'story', 'one', 'rich', 'vs', 'poor', 'Milagro', 'residents', 'have', 'lived', 'centuries', 'were', 'never', 'wealthy', 'made', 'do', 'community', 'Wealthy', 'developers', 'are', 'coming', 'build', 'community', 'luxury', 'who', 'can', 'pay', 'will', 'want', 'golf', 'course', 'where', 'bean', 'fields', 'now', 'stand.Characters', 'are', 'not', 'black', 'white', 'story', 'much', 'real-life', 'story', 'enriched', 'added', 'subtle', 'shades', 'many', 'complex', 'characters', 'Chick', 'Vennera', 'Joe', 'Mondragon', 'Mexican', 'father', 'left', 'one', 'proudest', 'bean', 'fields', 'Milagro', 'now', 'up', 'due', 'lack', 'irrigation', 'water', 'been', 'diverted', 'rich', 'developers', 'who', 'have', 'means', 'MAKE', 'water', 'flow', 'development', 'irrigation', 'ditch', 'right', 'bean', 'field', 'one', 'day', 'frustration', 'lack', 'work', 'Joe', 'valve', 'part', 'water', 'father', 'bean', 'field', 'Everyone', 'Milagro', 'immediately', 'significance', 'water', 'water', 'belongs', 'Mr.', 'Devine', 'developers', 'water', 'also', 'keeping', 'Milagro', 'former', 'agricultural', 'glory.Ruby', 'played', 'Sonia', 'Braga', 'auto', 'body', 'shop', 'where', 'honest', 'work', 'done', 'mechanics', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'expertise', 'work', 'new', 'Mercedes', 'Jaguars', 'will', 'be', 'coming', 'town', 'rich', 'developers', 'have', 'way', 'John', 'Heard', 'great', 'understated', 'role', 'Charlie', 'Bloom', 'lawyer', 'who', 'was', 'once', 'political', 'activist', 'who', 'now', 'Milagro', 'came', 'there', 'avoid', 'waves', 'Now', 'paper', 'only', 'out', 'couple', 'days', 'Ruby', 'pressures', 'Charlie', 'joining', 'cause', 'developers', 'sequence', 'town', 'meeting', 'Ruby', 'one', 'highlights', 'movie', 'Ruby', 'first', 'reluctant', 'Charlie', 'meeting', 'cover', 'paper', 'once', 'group', 'assembled', 'up', 'lawyer', 'expert', 'explain', 'people', 'WHY', 'important', 'Milagro', 'not', 'be', 'turned', 'high-priced', 'real', 'estate', 'scene', 'masterful', 'story-telling', 'most', 'clever', 'exposition', 'film', 'Charlie', 'plainly', 'once', 'rich', 'folks', 'move', ""'ll"", 'demand', 'better', 'schools', 'better', 'public', 'works', 'finally', 'families', 'have', 'lived', 'Milagro', '500', 'years', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'able', 'afford', 'taxes', 'own', 'community.Ruben', 'Blades', 'great', 'Sheriff', 'Montoya', 'perhaps', 'coolest', 'head', 'Milagro', 'Several', 'times', 'story', 'standoff', 'folks', 'aiming', 'guns', 'one', 'only', 'have', 'Sheriff', 'calm', 'situation', 'down', 'great', 'character', 'actor', 'James', 'Gannon', 'Shorty', 'who', 'employed', 'developers', 'also', 'sympathetic', 'natives', 'well.Daniel', 'Stern', 'college', 'boy', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'menacing', 'lawman', 'effective', 'performances.The', 'magic', 'Milagro', 'Redford', 'willingness', 'let', 'story', 'unfold', 'painting', 'town', 'unique', 'characters', 'warm', 'strokes', 'are', 'believable', 'engaging']",Milagro Beanfield War VHS

More than passable acting (a bit over-acted on Sonia Bragga's part, but not as bad as in ""Moon Over Parador"").  Redford is also a good director and this is better than his newer, more pretentious films.  If you can choke down yet another good-people-of-the-land-versus-greedy-developers plot, this isn't a bad film.This film is fairly true-to-life, too: Milagro in reality is Truchas, NM, a very old hardscrabble farm village between Chimayo and Penasco (that's in the real high country north of Santa Fe).

244534,A1KG5KFO32ALHP,6301065565,Randy Gibson,"[5, 5]","Others have summarized the plot below so I will try to add a few relevant thoughts.  First of all, the story is basically a skim off the John Nichols novel.  Like all his books, it is so deep in back story that no movie can contain more than a tithe of the actual narrative.  This screenplay actually does it justice, though.  The strength of the work is not the plot but the characters.  In Nichols' novel, each character has such richness and depth, they become very much alive and real.  Sadly, no movie can ever capture all of that, but I think Redford's efforts here managed to pick up enough of it to make the film work because the most important character in the film is the town of Milagro itself.  By getting even a glimpse of such venerable old-timers as Amarante Cordova, Onofre Martinez, and Nick Rael's crazy mother, we understand much more of Milagro's personality.Within the movie we get some very nice depth added to other characters, as well.  Reuben Blades as Sheriff Bernabe Montoya, for example, is tripping over his feet jumping a ditch in one scene and using cunning wisdom to disarm a firefight in the next.  Sonia Braga's passive-aggressive manipulation of John Heard's lawyer-activist is brilliantly played by both of them.  James Gammon as Horsethief Shorty, the one Anglo who may love Milagro as much as the local Hispanics, is perfectly played, as well.The film is beautifully photographed and Redford's love of the American Southwest is visually documented here with a very nice touch.  The soundtrack also adds a lot of character to the piece and is very well placed.  Finally, two small roles that I thought added a lot to the movie were Julie Carmen as Nancy Mondragon, Joe's wife, and also Freddy Fender as Milagro's mayor, Sammy Cantu.Overall, this is one of those movies that isn't so much about what happens in the film as it is about how the director and the actors portray it, which in this case is done beautifully.",5,Overlooked for far too long,1112659200,"04 5, 2005",2005,1954,"['Others', 'have', 'summarized', 'plot', 'so', 'will', 'try', 'add', 'few', 'relevant', 'thoughts', 'First', 'all', 'story', 'basically', 'skim', 'John', 'Nichols', 'novel', 'books', 'so', 'deep', 'back', 'story', 'movie', 'can', 'contain', 'more', 'tithe', 'actual', 'narrative', 'screenplay', 'actually', 'justice', 'though', 'strength', 'work', 'not', 'plot', 'characters', 'Nichols', 'novel', 'character', 'such', 'richness', 'depth', 'become', 'very', 'much', 'alive', 'real', 'Sadly', 'movie', 'can', 'ever', 'capture', 'think', 'Redford', 'efforts', 'here', 'managed', 'pick', 'up', 'enough', 'make', 'film', 'work', 'most', 'important', 'character', 'film', 'town', 'Milagro', 'getting', 'even', 'glimpse', 'such', 'venerable', 'old-timers', 'Amarante', 'Cordova', 'Onofre', 'Martinez', 'Nick', 'Rael', 'crazy', 'mother', 'understand', 'much', 'more', 'Milagro', 'personality.Within', 'movie', 'get', 'very', 'nice', 'depth', 'added', 'other', 'characters', 'as', 'well', 'Reuben', 'Blades', 'Sheriff', 'Bernabe', 'Montoya', 'example', 'tripping', 'feet', 'jumping', 'ditch', 'one', 'scene', 'using', 'cunning', 'wisdom', 'disarm', 'firefight', 'next', 'Sonia', 'Braga', 'passive-aggressive', 'manipulation', 'John', 'Heard', 'lawyer-activist', 'brilliantly', 'played', 'James', 'Gammon', 'Horsethief', 'Shorty', 'one', 'Anglo', 'who', 'may', 'love', 'Milagro', 'as', 'much', 'local', 'Hispanics', 'perfectly', 'played', 'well.The', 'film', 'beautifully', 'photographed', 'Redford', 'love', 'American', 'Southwest', 'visually', 'documented', 'here', 'very', 'nice', 'touch', 'soundtrack', 'also', 'lot', 'character', 'piece', 'very', 'well', 'placed', 'Finally', 'two', 'small', 'roles', 'thought', 'added', 'lot', 'movie', 'were', 'Julie', 'Carmen', 'Nancy', 'Mondragon', 'Joe', 'wife', 'also', 'Freddy', 'Fender', 'Milagro', 'mayor', 'Sammy', 'Cantu.Overall', 'one', 'movies', ""n't"", 'so', 'much', 'what', 'film', 'how', 'director', 'actors', 'portray', 'case', 'done', 'beautifully']",Milagro Beanfield War VHS

244537,A1NVIEXCA20W7N,6301065565,Reliable Reviews Too,"[0, 0]","It is worth watching this film for the beautiful instrumental music alone at the beginning and end of the film.Some subtle humor. A story about poor folks coming together. A story about the government-union partnering with the rich to sell-out the poor.A rich developer has stolen the water-rights of a small village in New Mexico through political and legal corruption. The people have no water to farm for themselves. The selfish, greedy, developer also plans to force the folks out by raising their taxes through public projects for his development, which the poor townsfolk cannot afford.A poor man's house is the last hold-out right in the middle of the developer's planned golf-course. This poor man takes a positive step out of the gloom by re-planting his father's small bean-field on his own land, but using the water which flows along the edge of his land; water which is ""owned"" by the developer. The poor man will not make any significant money from this small garden, and is only doing it to boost his own morale. However, the developer and the petty government officials in his pocket are outraged at this affront to their power.This movie realistically portrays the mentality of many within the self-serving, government-employees-union.The developer has bought-up the land of families, who were able to move. Only old people living on the outskirts of the development are left. This gloomy scenario gives the film an unappealing appearance on the surface, so I thought I would not like it, but I did. There is a lot you come to understand as the movie goes along. At first I thought they were in Mexico instead of the U.S., New Mexico.Late in the film Ruby goes to the local store; in the background a woman shopper picks up a bottle of 'Newman's Own Salad Dressing""; the clerk says, ""That's no good."" Producer Robert Redford taking a jab at his friend Paul Newman.The old man with the sombrero who plays the accordian and talks to the old man with the pet pig is his guardian-angel. In the middle of the film; he is sitting with the old-man; but when another person arrives his chair is shown empty from the stranger's point of view, while the old man continues to talk to him.",5,The poor fight corrupt government-union officials.,1361836800,"02 26, 2013",2013,2193,"['worth', 'watching', 'film', 'beautiful', 'instrumental', 'music', 'alone', 'beginning', 'end', 'film.Some', 'subtle', 'humor', 'story', 'poor', 'folks', 'coming', 'together', 'A', 'story', 'government-union', 'partnering', 'rich', 'sell-out', 'poor.A', 'rich', 'developer', 'stolen', 'water-rights', 'small', 'village', 'New', 'Mexico', 'political', 'legal', 'corruption', 'people', 'have', 'water', 'farm', 'selfish', 'greedy', 'developer', 'also', 'force', 'folks', 'out', 'raising', 'taxes', 'public', 'projects', 'development', 'poor', 'townsfolk', 'can', 'not', 'afford.A', 'poor', 'man', 'house', 'last', 'hold-out', 'right', 'middle', 'developer', 'planned', 'golf-course', 'poor', 'man', 'positive', 'step', 'gloom', 're-planting', 'father', 'small', 'bean-field', 'own', 'land', 'using', 'water', 'edge', 'land', 'water', 'owned', 'developer', 'poor', 'man', 'will', 'not', 'make', 'significant', 'money', 'small', 'garden', 'only', 'doing', 'boost', 'own', 'morale', 'However', 'developer', 'petty', 'government', 'officials', 'pocket', 'are', 'outraged', 'affront', 'power.This', 'movie', 'realistically', 'mentality', 'many', 'self-serving', 'government-employees-union.The', 'developer', 'bought-up', 'land', 'families', 'who', 'were', 'able', 'move', 'Only', 'old', 'people', 'living', 'outskirts', 'development', 'are', 'left', 'gloomy', 'scenario', 'film', 'unappealing', 'appearance', 'surface', 'thought', 'would', 'not', 'like', 'did', 'lot', 'come', 'understand', 'movie', 'along', 'first', 'thought', 'were', 'Mexico', 'instead', 'U.S.', 'New', 'Mexico.Late', 'film', 'Ruby', 'local', 'store', 'background', 'woman', 'shopper', 'up', 'bottle', ""'Newman"", 'Own', 'Salad', 'Dressing', 'clerk', 'good', 'Producer', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'taking', 'jab', 'friend', 'Paul', 'Newman.The', 'old', 'man', 'sombrero', 'who', 'accordian', 'talks', 'old', 'man', 'pet', 'pig', 'guardian-angel', 'middle', 'film', 'sitting', 'old-man', 'when', 'person', 'chair', 'shown', 'empty', 'stranger', 'point', 'view', 'old', 'man', 'talk']",Milagro Beanfield War VHS
244538,A12X2J7AVZ04IQ,6301065565,"R. Gawlitta ""Coolmoan""","[58, 61]","Only Robert Redford's 2nd directorial effort, this film is purely from the heart. This is a true ensemble piece, worthy of Altman, and Redford's love of the land is quite appropriate. I was most impressed with the fact that this film is about  Mexican/Native American types, and found no need for sex, drugs, blood or real violence (that stuff seems to prevail when regarding cultural differences). How refreshing. Foremost is the fact that this has a whimsical element of fantasy, and a quasi David/Goliath subtext. I was especially amused when the old man was playing chess with the Angel (a bit of Bergman, perhaps?). Aside from the gorgeous vistas of New Mexico, beautifully photographed, it is Dave Grusin's Oscar-winning score that is most intriguing (it's ONLY Oscar nomination). The lovely guitar of Angel Romero is prevalent throughout, adding to Grusin's 5/8 time with endless modulations, suggesting that this is a land that will go on forever. The acting is wonderful, without exception. The previous reviewers have all failed to mention how strong Chick Vennera was in the lead role. So very handsome, and so un-self-conscious. A wonderful performance. If there would be a second lead, it would have to be Carlos Riquelme as the old geezer that everyone thinks is nuts, but actually talks to Angels. Sonia Braga, John Heard, Daniel Stern, Nancy Mandragon, and especially, James Gammon, were all solid. I love this film a lot, because it really makes me feel good. And that music...it stays with you. Quite haunting.
