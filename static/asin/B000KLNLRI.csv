Dravis ""BETTY DRAVIS, author/reviewer""","[19, 27]","I may be slow in seeing TV shows, but I spend all my time writing my own novels, reading and reviewing books, and watching and reviewing more mainstream movies, so I suppose that excuses me.I hate to admit I have never seen even ONE episode of South Park on TV, but I've heard others raving about it, so I decided to order one from Netflix.  But first I asked my granddaughter if it was ""nasty"" or simply raunchy.  When she said ""clever, hilarious, AND raunchy,"" I liked the sound of that, so ordered this Ninth Season.I just finished watching it and must admit I laughed all the way through.  The creators of this hilarious, up-to-date, animated comedy are ""spot on"" in covering riotous aspects of the ""human condition"" and making it appeal to the masses.My favorite episode is the controversial ""Trapped in the Closet,"" a satirical look at Scientology and Tom Cruise's.  I admire Tom Cruise's acting ability (and dislike his ties to Scientology), but would never put him down--except in the spirit of fun--which is what SOUTH PARK is all about, IMO.SOUTH PARK is not for the sensitive soul or those who lack a sense of humor, but it's perfect for the rest of us.  As I said, I laughed all the way through each episode, and since ""laughter is the best medicine,"" I recommend it highly.I agree with the reviewer who said, ""It's about as good as animated comedy can get.""",5,"NOT for the sensitive soul, but perfect for the rest of us!",1183939200,"07 9, 2007",2007,1370,"['may', 'be', 'slow', 'seeing', 'TV', 'shows', 'spend', 'time', 'writing', 'own', 'novels', 'reading', 'reviewing', 'books', 'watching', 'reviewing', 'more', 'mainstream', 'movies', 'suppose', 'me.I', 'hate', 'admit', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'even', 'ONE', 'episode', 'South', 'Park', 'TV', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'others', 'raving', 'decided', 'order', 'one', 'Netflix', 'first', 'asked', 'granddaughter', 'was', 'nasty', 'simply', 'raunchy', 'When', 'said', 'clever', 'hilarious', 'AND', 'raunchy', 'liked', 'sound', 'so', 'ordered', 'Ninth', 'Season.I', 'just', 'finished', 'watching', 'must', 'admit', 'laughed', 'way', 'creators', 'hilarious', 'up-to-date', 'animated', 'comedy', 'are', 'spot', 'covering', 'riotous', 'aspects', 'human', 'condition', 'making', 'appeal', 'masses.My', 'favorite', 'episode', 'controversial', 'Trapped', 'Closet', 'satirical', 'look', 'Scientology', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'admire', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'acting', 'ability', 'dislike', 'ties', 'Scientology', 'would', 'never', 'put', 'down', 'spirit', 'fun', 'what', 'SOUTH', 'PARK', 'IMO.SOUTH', 'PARK', 'not', 'sensitive', 'soul', 'who', 'lack', 'sense', 'humor', 'perfect', 'rest', 'said', 'laughed', 'way', 'episode', 'laughter', 'best', 'medicine', 'recommend', 'agree', 'reviewer', 'who', 'said', 'as', 'good', 'animated', 'comedy', 'can', 'get']",N/A

1034884,A2E3F04ZK7FG66,B000KLNLRI,calvinnme,"[7, 12]","Season nine is as good a season of South Park as any. Of course the stand out is ""Trapped in the Closet"". That's the episode that saw Isaac Hayes, the voice of Chef, draw the line at making sport of other people. The ""other people"" in this case were Scientologists, and Hayes, of course, is a Scientologist himself. It's funny how Hayes went nine years making fun of everything from Mormons to the mentally handicapped without a peep of disapproval, but the episode on Scientology was somehow the final straw. The beloved Chef is given a proper exit in season ten by splicing together past pieces of dialogue from the character, and once again Matt and Trey manage to make sport of Scientology. But I digress. Episode one of season nine sees a big change for Mr. Garrison. However, once he becomes a woman, the most amazing thing happens - Mr. Garrison becomes a social conservative. Since he no longer needs the protection of social tolerance, he quickly abandons it himself. ""The Losing Edge"" talks about a hard fact most people don't want to discuss - baseball is just plain boring to many youngsters of today. In this episode the South Park team continues to advance through the Little League play-offs because they just can't seem to pull off being as bad as the other teams, who are also trying to lose so as not to forfeit their summer vacation. Matt and Trey continue to make statements in episodes that parallel well known events this season, such as in ""Best Friends Forever"" where Kenny is in a vegetative state after being hit by a truck. Stan and Kyle get into a battle with Cartman over keeping Kenny's feeding tube inserted which ends up involving and lampooning every national group that usually gets involved in these cases. Of course, Cartman's motivation in this whole thing is that Kenny left him his Sony PSP game in his will, and Kenny has to die for Cartman to actually take possession of it.It's really amazing that South Park is still with us and still funny after all of these years. When it first came on the air in 1997, I thought it would be a real shooting star of comedy. I predicted that this primitively animated show featuring four foul-mouthed little boys and their misadventures that are actually adult entertainment would be a hilarious joke that would get old fast. Instead Matt and Trey have managed to keep it fresh. I felt the show faltered a bit around season four when they relied too much on having the show focus on current events and got away from the boys and their childhood adventures, but I think over the last few seasons they've found a nice balance between the two. Highly recommended.",5,Still funny after all of these years,1172880000,"03 3, 2007",2007,2638,"['Season', 'nine', 'as', 'good', 'season', 'South', 'Park', 'course', 'stand', 'out', 'Trapped', 'Closet', 'episode', 'saw', 'Isaac', 'Hayes', 'voice', 'Chef', 'line', 'making', 'sport', 'other', 'people', 'other', 'people', 'case', 'were', 'Scientologists', 'Hayes', 'course', 'Scientologist', 'funny', 'how', 'Hayes', 'went', 'nine', 'years', 'making', 'fun', 'everything', 'Mormons', 'mentally', 'handicapped', 'peep', 'disapproval', 'episode', 'Scientology', 'was', 'somehow', 'final', 'straw', 'beloved', 'Chef', 'given', 'proper', 'exit', 'season', 'ten', 'splicing', 'together', 'past', 'pieces', 'dialogue', 'character', 'once', 'again', 'Matt', 'Trey', 'manage', 'make', 'sport', 'Scientology', 'digress', 'Episode', 'one', 'season', 'nine', 'big', 'change', 'Mr.', 'Garrison', 'However', 'once', 'woman', 'most', 'amazing', 'thing', 'Mr.', 'Garrison', 'social', 'conservative', 'no', 'longer', 'protection', 'social', 'tolerance', 'quickly', 'Losing', 'Edge', 'talks', 'hard', 'fact', 'most', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'discuss', 'baseball', 'just', 'plain', 'boring', 'many', 'youngsters', 'today', 'episode', 'South', 'Park', 'team', 'advance', 'Little', 'League', 'play-offs', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'pull', 'off', 'being', 'as', 'bad', 'other', 'teams', 'who', 'are', 'also', 'trying', 'lose', 'so', 'not', 'forfeit', 'summer', 'vacation', 'Matt', 'Trey', 'continue', 'make', 'statements', 'episodes', 'parallel', 'well', 'known', 'events', 'season', 'such', 'Best', 'Friends', 'Forever', 'where', 'Kenny', 'vegetative', 'state', 'being', 'hit', 'truck', 'Stan', 'Kyle', 'get', 'battle', 'Cartman', 'keeping', 'Kenny', 'feeding', 'tube', 'inserted', 'up', 'involving', 'lampooning', 'national', 'group', 'usually', 'involved', 'cases', 'course', 'Cartman', 'motivation', 'whole', 'thing', 'Kenny', 'left', 'Sony', 'PSP', 'game', 'will', 'Kenny', 'die', 'Cartman', 'actually', 'take', 'possession', 'it.It', 'really', 'amazing', 'South', 'Park', 'still', 'still', 'funny', 'years', 'When', 'first', 'came', 'air', '1997', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'real', 'shooting', 'star', 'comedy', 'predicted', 'primitively', 'animated', 'show', 'featuring', 'four', 'foul-mouthed', 'little', 'boys', 'misadventures', 'are', 'actually', 'adult', 'entertainment', 'would', 'be', 'hilarious', 'joke', 'would', 'get', 'old', 'fast', 'Instead', 'Matt', 'Trey', 'have', 'managed', 'keep', 'fresh', 'felt', 'show', 'faltered', 'bit', 'season', 'four', 'when', 'relied', 'too', 'much', 'having', 'show', 'focus', 'current', 'events', 'got', 'away', 'boys', 'childhood', 'adventures', 'think', 'last', 'few', 'seasons', ""'ve"", 'found', 'nice', 'balance', 'two', 'Highly', 'recommended']",N/A

I look at that global warming episode and think ""geez, where's the humor, guys?""  They start out with a fairly outrageous premise and turn it into their agenda to keep the world complacent!Of course the show is at its best when Cartman is given his comeuppance.  My favorite is the one in which the kids, fed up with Cartman's greed after he eats all the tastier portions of their fried chicken takeout while the others help Stan's mom in with the groceries, decide to teach him a lesson by not speaking to him.  Eric convinces himself, as coincidences collide, that he is deadand, when Butters (who is unaware of the other kids' refusal to speak to Cartman) *DOES* speak to him, that this naive boy is the only one who can see him!!  Like one other reviewer had said, the show is at its best when it features kids being kids!!  When the duo get on their soap box about some issue, it becomes boring.  Perhaps any of those types of episodes are funnier when they air since it does seem as if they respond to the week's news headlines during that very same week, but how much impact are such story lines going to have when the incident in question is long forgotten about?",3,Wag That Dog's Finger,1178323200,"05 5, 2007",2007,1384,"['Well', 'here', 'are', 'ninth', 'season', 'still', 'interesting', 'show', 'far', 'too', 'much', 'attitude', 'humor', 'season', 'guys', 'are', 'somehow', 'believing', 'word', 'gospel', 'look', 'global', 'warming', 'episode', 'think', 'geez', 'where', 'humor', 'guys', 'start', 'out', 'fairly', 'outrageous', 'premise', 'turn', 'agenda', 'keep', 'world', 'complacent', 'course', 'show', 'best', 'when', 'Cartman', 'given', 'comeuppance', 'favorite', 'one', 'kids', 'fed', 'up', 'Cartman', 'greed', 'tastier', 'portions', 'fried', 'chicken', 'takeout', 'others', 'help', 'Stan', 'mom', 'groceries', 'decide', 'teach', 'lesson', 'not', 'speaking', 'Eric', 'coincidences', 'collide', 'deadand', 'when', 'Butters', 'who', 'unaware', 'other', 'kids', 'refusal', 'speak', 'Cartman', 'speak', 'naive', 'boy', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'can', 'see', 'one', 'other', 'reviewer', 'had', 'said', 'show', 'best', 'when', 'kids', 'being', 'kids', 'When', 'duo', 'get', 'soap', 'box', 'issue', 'boring', 'Perhaps', 'types', 'episodes', 'are', 'funnier', 'when', 'air', 'seem', 'respond', 'week', 'news', 'headlines', 'very', 'same', 'week', 'how', 'much', 'impact', 'are', 'such', 'story', 'lines', 'going', 'have', 'when', 'incident', 'question', 'long', 'forgotten']",N/A

""Die Hippie Die"",""Ginger Kids"" and ""The Losing Edge"" are probably my three favorites (at this moment anyway). I love how ""Two Days Before the Day after Tomorrow"" shows how society overreacts and the TV news blows everything out of proportion. Of course in the infamous ""Trapped in the Closet"" episode Stan finds the Church of Scientology (""but it's not a religion, how about those Broncos?"") and they dub him the reincarnation of L. Ron Hubbard which brings some famous folk to South Park. The boys then travel to Hollywood in ""Wing"" after they start the Super Awesome Talent Agency and their clients keeping getting stolen. In ""Follow that Egg"" Mr. Garrison assigns Kyle and Stan to look after an egg in a sad attempt to prove gay marriages don't work after he finds out Mr Slave is about to be married to Big Gay Al, but the egg even survives an assasination attempt(!).

Or ,'too preachy to be funny'. But lets face it, despite the fact that the creators have added more layers to their stories and gone for more socially relevant themes, it is still damned funny in its own right. And lets face it, these guys are having a tough time coming up with new show ideas. They produce the show the week it airs, for gods sake!! Lets see you meet a deadline like that. And as for season 9 itself, well, it had its moments like 'Best Friends Forever', 'Free Willzyx', 'The Losing Edge', 'Follow that Egg', and 'Marjorine'. My least faves here were 'Mr Garrisons Fancy New Vagina' and 'Erection Day'. Two of the worst episodes I have ever seen. Worse than that 'Pip' episode in season 4. The crowning achievement of this season was the 'Trapped in the Closet', a scathing look at Scientology that not only caused huge controversy but had the distinction of being the only episode to be pulled from the rotation because of a celebrity being upset over the shows portrayal of him. And, once the scientologists came at them, the catholics saw their opportunity with 'Bloody Mary'. Consequently, these DVD's are the only way anyone can ever see these episodes at all.

The trend almost continued with Season 9 but I don't think it is quite as solid as Season 8, but close.  Still there are several slam-dunk episodes in this set:  ""Mr. Garrison's Fancy New V---,"" ""The Losing Edge,"" ""The Death of Eric Cartman,"" ""Follow That Egg,"" and ""Bloody Mary.""  Either ""Mr. Garrison's...,"" ""Follow That Egg,"" or ""Bloody Mary"" is my favorite, it's difficult to choose.  There are other excellent eps as well like ""Best Friends Forever"" (which won an Emmy), ""Erection Day,"" ""Two Days Before...,"" and ""Marjorine.""  This set also has the controversial episode ""Trapped in the Closet"" about Tom Cruise and Scientology that caused the ""Chef"" Isaac Hayes falling out. Jam-packed with quality SP humor taking current events and issues waaaay over-the-top, here's what you get:Disc 1:""Mr. Garrison's Fancy New V..."" Kyle is depressed that Jew's can't play basketball.  Inspired by Mr. Garrison's recent sex change, Kyle undergoes a ""Negroplasty"" (opposite of the ""Caucasianplasty that Michael Jackson had).  What he does not realize is that the procedure is only for cosmetic purposes.""Die Hippie, Die"":  This is one of my least favorites of this season.  Cartman detects signs of a Hippie Music Jam Festival forming in South Park, but is put in jail for locking them in the basement.  When the town sees the hippies taking over, they seek Cartman's help.  Cartman's plan: take out the hippies with Slayer.""Wing"": After Token wins a singing contest, the boys start a talent agency to try to cash in on Token's potential royalties.  When another agent steals him away, the boys sign a new talent: The City Wok guy's wife who has a penchant for singing ABBA songs and has ties with the Asian Mafia.""Best Friends Forever"":  Emmy award-winner.  Did any fan of the early days of South Park see that coming?  Kenny is so good at playing ""Heaven v. Hell"" on PSP that heaven has him killed so he can leave earth and command their armies.  Before the big showdown, doctors on earth revive him to a ""tomato"" state where the big debate ensues.  Interesting take on the ""pull the plug"" issue.""The Losing Edge"":  The boys hate Little League and try to lose to end their season and Stan's dad's dreams...of beating up a father of the opposing team during the state championships.  The Bat Dad: ""You're about to be bat dadded!""  Hilarious!Disc 2:""The Death of Eric Cartman"":  Cartman has done many bad things, but eating the skin off the Colonel's chicken is the last straw.  His friends all ignore him to the point where Cartman believes he is dead.  He recruits the help of an ignorant Butters to try to give his soul peace to reach the other side.""Erection Day"":  Jimmy is psyched to win the school's talent show but is having puberty issues.  He goes on a quest to relieve his problem before his act, meeting Nut Gobbler.  The Goth kids at the talent show play an anti-talent show song and then one of them says, ""I hope we win.""""Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow"":  Stan and Cartman drive a boat into a giant beaver dam flooding the nearby town of Beaverton.  While Stan is burdened down by guilt about the Beaverton residents stranded on their rooftops, the folks of South Park blame the event on global warming and barricade themselves from impending doom.""Marjorine"":  Cartman convinces Butters to fake his own death and come back as the new girl in town so as to get invited to the girls' slumber party and steal their mysterious fortune-telling device.""Follow That Egg"":  Excellent episode addressing the gay marriage issue as only SP can.  ""Mrs."" Garrison's class is paired up with eggs to learn about parenting (Token's team is given a brown egg).  After Mr. Slave gets engaged to Big Gay Al, Mrs. Garrison goes on a campaign against gay marriage and conducts an experiment in his class.Disc 3:""Ginger Kids"":  Cartman starts vicious rumors about kids with red hair and freckles and they begin to be discriminated against.  To teach Cartman a lesson, Stan, Kyle and Kenny sneak into Cartman's room, knock him out, and give him a ginger makeover. Cartman then starts the Ginger Separatist Movement.  Cartman sees no irony in this.""Trapped in the Closet"":  The Church of Scientology believes Stan is the reincarnation of L. Ron Hubbard.  When Stan doesn't praise his acting skills, Hubbard-worshipper Tom Cruise hides away in Stan's closet.  Meanwhile, Stan learns some disturbing things about scientology.  Isaac Hayes fall-out episode.""Free Willzyx"":  A performing Orca whale at the sea park can communicate with the boys who believe he must return to his native planet, the moon, or he will die.  That composite sketch of the kids is great (especially Cartman and Kyle--although Kyle's mother doesn't think it is a good likeness).""Bloody Mary"":  Stan's dad is busted for DUI and believes he has no power over his alcoholism disease.  He needs a miracle.  Good news!  A statue of the Virgin Mary is bleeding out her...uh...posterior.

1034901,AJKWF4W7QD4NS,B000KLNLRI,"N. Durham ""Big Evil""","[21, 36]","Nine seasons of South Park and the brainchild of Matt Stone and Trey Parker is still going strong.  The animated show of bawdy lunacy continues to push forward in it's ninth season, however, we kind of get off to a rocky start.  In the season premiere, ""Mr. Garrison's Fancy New Vagina"", Mr. Garrison gets a sex-change operation, and Kyle attempts to undergo a procedure to turn into an African American to make the basketball team.  While this episode has it's moments, for the most part it's not as funny as one would hope or think.  The next few episodes, including ""Wing"", ""Erection Day"", and ""Ginger Kids"" follow this same path, but thankfully the good outweighs the bad here.  ""Best Friends Forever"" finds Kenny obsessed with his new PSP; so much so that it ends up getting him killed and helping Heaven beat Hell in an apocalyptic battle.  ""The Losing Edge"", ""Marjorine"", ""Follow That Egg"", and ""Free Willyx"" are when the season hits it's stride thanks to the same formula that helped the show become such a smash: it's at it's best when it's kids being kids.  This season also had a heaping of controversey, most notably from Tom Cruise thanks to ""Trapped in the Closet"" which saw a look at Scientology, and the aforementioned celebrity's refusal to leave a certain part of Stan's room.  ""Bloody Mary"" also saw an outcry from the Catholics involving a bleeding statue of the Virgin Mary, and that's as far as I'll go from there.  Despite it's rocky beginning, the ninth season of South Park is what you'd come to expect from the long running series in terms of laughs and gags, but one has to wonder if the creators are losing their touch a bit now that the show has reached the ten year mark (and quite a few episodes from the first run of the tenth season are sadly among the worst of the series), which would be a crying shame to say the least.  All in all though, the ninth season of South Park is almost as good as animated comedy can get, and you can do far, far worse to boot.",4,"Great stuff, although there are a few misses...",1169424000,"01 22, 2007",2007,1991,"['Nine', 'seasons', 'South', 'Park', 'brainchild', 'Matt', 'Stone', 'Trey', 'Parker', 'still', 'going', 'strong', 'animated', 'show', 'bawdy', 'lunacy', 'push', 'forward', 'ninth', 'season', 'however', 'kind', 'get', 'rocky', 'start', 'season', 'premiere', 'Mr.', 'Garrison', 'Fancy', 'New', 'Vagina', 'Mr.', 'Garrison', 'sex-change', 'operation', 'Kyle', 'attempts', 'undergo', 'procedure', 'turn', 'African', 'American', 'make', 'basketball', 'team', 'episode', 'moments', 'most', 'part', 'not', 'as', 'funny', 'one', 'would', 'hope', 'think', 'next', 'few', 'episodes', 'including', 'Wing', 'Erection', 'Day', 'Ginger', 'Kids', 'follow', 'same', 'path', 'thankfully', 'good', 'bad', 'here', 'Best', 'Friends', 'Forever', 'Kenny', 'obsessed', 'new', 'PSP', 'so', 'much', 'up', 'getting', 'killed', 'helping', 'Heaven', 'beat', 'Hell', 'apocalyptic', 'battle', 'Losing', 'Edge', 'Marjorine', 'Follow', 'Egg', 'Free', 'Willyx', 'are', 'when', 'season', 'stride', 'thanks', 'same', 'formula', 'helped', 'show', 'become', 'such', 'smash', 'best', 'when', 'kids', 'being', 'kids', 'season', 'also', 'had', 'heaping', 'controversey', 'most', 'notably', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'thanks', 'Trapped', 'Closet', 'saw', 'look', 'Scientology', 'aforementioned', 'celebrity', 'refusal', 'leave', 'certain', 'part', 'Stan', 'room', 'Bloody', 'Mary', 'also', 'saw', 'outcry', 'Catholics', 'involving', 'bleeding', 'statue', 'Virgin', 'Mary', 'as', 'far', ""'ll"", 'go', 'there', 'rocky', 'beginning', 'ninth', 'season', 'South', 'Park', 'what', ""'d"", 'come', 'expect', 'long', 'running', 'series', 'terms', 'laughs', 'gags', 'one', 'wonder', 'creators', 'are', 'losing', 'touch', 'bit', 'now', 'show', 'reached', 'ten', 'year', 'mark', 'quite', 'few', 'episodes', 'first', 'run', 'tenth', 'season', 'are', 'sadly', 'worst', 'series', 'would', 'be', 'crying', 'shame', 'say', 'least', 'ninth', 'season', 'South', 'Park', 'almost', 'as', 'good', 'animated', 'comedy', 'can', 'get', 'can', 'do', 'far', 'far', 'worse', 'boot']",N/A

1034903,A3GGD7ZWVWIKOU,B000KLNLRI,"Peter P. Fuchs ""&#34;The Meta-Reviewer&#34;""","[1, 1]","It's amazing how many times I have thought of South Park episodes and just started to laugh. Comic genius barely even sums up the cleverness of the show of course. Prescience is surely one of the other virtues of the show. But I was reflecting recently that perhaps not prescience as many, particularly the creators, might like to think. ""Trapped in the Closet"" is certainly one of the funniest and prescient of all the episodes, and unsubtle commentary on the world-view of sofa-bouncing movie stars hardly could be more pointed. Yet my reflections recently lead me to conclusion that the South Park take on things, super- clever though it is, is also a sort of prologue to a new closeted way-of-being for the younger generation. For my generation of gay people  coming out of the closet meant essentially interjecting the reality of our lives and loves into a world that acted as if they didn't exist. And by the way, blinkered portrayals and crazy claims are a form of absence. If the other person in life is different from you one way to maintain a sense of unreality about that person is by creating zany mistruths about them. This is the dark side of human interaction. It is only when someone is real enough in a society to get rights that -- miraculously -- the mistruths start vanishing as well. So when my generation came out you really had to assert your own reality in a way, plain and simple. Many of us were lucky to be able to do so in lives filled with love and fun, but clearly not always. How different the world is now for people coming out. I reflect that people ""trapped in closet"" today have a perhaps more tangled time of it, in strange irony. For now ""being gay"" is not something undiscussed...hardly! It seems all that the media seem to discuss! But how is that that could possibly make it harder to come out in a way?? I think it goes something like this. Before, if a kid was gay, he kept it to himself. Since no one wanted to discuss it anywhere, he naturally sought out his own life away from other people's existential equations. In a way that was a liberating set-up. Of course in other  ways it was terrible. But how otherwise it must be in the family scene today. Even in a family where the parents are against open acceptance of gay -sexuality, there is naturally still a vastly more freed-up sense of discussion about it. For the simple reasons that it is now everywhere discussed. So I can well imagine that parent who don't like gay sexuality in fact may quiz their children now much more if they don't see them doing predictable heterosexual things at certain ages. And since, concomitantly, psychological rhetoric has entered society much more, I can well imagine that some  parents feel free-up to be armchair gay reparative psychologists for their children. It might go something like this: ""Ricky are you have gay feelings??"" After Ricky answers yes hesitantly, the parents begin a compassionate yet still conservatively religious ramble about how they love the kid, but they are going to work with him to address the complex issues both psychological and religious that touch on the matter. Because the kid loves his parents, he is drawn into more and more talk about the matter. Thus in the end, to come out the closet he would have to overcome the original strictures of the religion, but also be willing to let his parents feel like failures in theirrecent attempts at ""discussing"" the matter in a modern and hip way!! Coming out then means that you question the parents idea of themselves as modern and hip as well. Because we all know that reactionary types, no matter how prejudicial, always also consider themselves very with-it, and modern and hip. This would be a lot harder. The South Park ethos is hilarious, but it is already a bit old fashioned. It belongs to the pie-in-you-face interjection of reality that characterized the old way of being. Coming out now means not only coming to terms yourselves, but helping your pseudo-hip parents understand that their reactionary views are not hip are just the worst kind of dirty, skeezy old bubba thinking dressed up in fancy clothes. Not how people want to see themselves. And that is a lot to ask of a kid. Where South Park was a great cultural success is in proving that you could laugh at the whole complicated matter of ""coming out""  thoroughly. It is only sad, upon reflection, that despite society's ability to laugh,  it seems to have become more complicated, whereas one would think the opposite.",5,Prologue to the New Closet,1293148800,"12 24, 2010",2010,4506,"['amazing', 'how', 'many', 'times', 'have', 'thought', 'South', 'Park', 'episodes', 'just', 'started', 'laugh', 'Comic', 'genius', 'barely', 'even', 'sums', 'up', 'cleverness', 'show', 'course', 'Prescience', 'surely', 'one', 'other', 'virtues', 'show', 'was', 'reflecting', 'recently', 'perhaps', 'not', 'prescience', 'many', 'particularly', 'creators', 'might', 'like', 'think', 'Trapped', 'Closet', 'certainly', 'one', 'funniest', 'prescient', 'episodes', 'unsubtle', 'commentary', 'world-view', 'sofa-bouncing', 'movie', 'stars', 'hardly', 'could', 'be', 'more', 'pointed', 'reflections', 'recently', 'lead', 'conclusion', 'South', 'Park', 'take', 'things', 'super-', 'clever', 'also', 'sort', 'prologue', 'new', 'closeted', 'way-of-being', 'younger', 'generation', 'generation', 'gay', 'people', 'coming', 'closet', 'meant', 'essentially', 'interjecting', 'reality', 'lives', 'world', 'acted', 'did', ""n't"", 'exist', 'way', 'blinkered', 'portrayals', 'crazy', 'claims', 'are', 'form', 'absence', 'other', 'person', 'life', 'different', 'one', 'way', 'maintain', 'sense', 'unreality', 'person', 'creating', 'zany', 'mistruths', 'dark', 'side', 'human', 'interaction', 'only', 'when', 'someone', 'real', 'enough', 'society', 'get', 'rights', 'miraculously', 'mistruths', 'start', 'vanishing', 'as', 'well', 'So', 'when', 'generation', 'came', 'out', 'really', 'had', 'assert', 'own', 'reality', 'way', 'plain', 'simple', 'Many', 'were', 'lucky', 'be', 'able', 'do', 'so', 'lives', 'filled', 'love', 'fun', 'clearly', 'not', 'always', 'How', 'different', 'world', 'now', 'people', 'coming', 'out', 'reflect', 'people', 'trapped', 'closet', 'today', 'have', 'perhaps', 'more', 'tangled', 'time', 'strange', 'irony', 'now', 'being', 'gay', 'not', 'something', 'undiscussed', 'hardly', 'media', 'seem', 'discuss', 'how', 'could', 'possibly', 'make', 'harder', 'come', 'out', 'way', 'think', 'something', 'kid', 'was', 'gay', 'kept', 'one', 'wanted', 'discuss', 'anywhere', 'naturally', 'sought', 'out', 'own', 'life', 'away', 'other', 'people', 'existential', 'equations', 'way', 'was', 'liberating', 'set-up', 'course', 'other', 'ways', 'was', 'terrible', 'how', 'otherwise', 'must', 'be', 'family', 'scene', 'today', 'Even', 'family', 'where', 'parents', 'are', 'open', 'acceptance', 'gay', '-sexuality', 'naturally', 'still', 'vastly', 'more', 'freed-up', 'sense', 'discussion', 'simple', 'reasons', 'now', 'everywhere', 'discussed', 'can', 'well', 'imagine', 'parent', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'gay', 'sexuality', 'fact', 'may', 'quiz', 'children', 'now', 'much', 'more', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'doing', 'predictable', 'heterosexual', 'things', 'certain', 'ages', 'concomitantly', 'psychological', 'rhetoric', 'entered', 'society', 'much', 'more', 'can', 'well', 'imagine', 'parents', 'feel', 'free-up', 'be', 'armchair', 'gay', 'reparative', 'psychologists', 'children', 'might', 'go', 'something', 'Ricky', 'are', 'have', 'gay', 'feelings', 'Ricky', 'answers', 'yes', 'hesitantly', 'parents', 'begin', 'compassionate', 'yet', 'still', 'conservatively', 'religious', 'ramble', 'how', 'love', 'kid', 'are', 'going', 'work', 'address', 'complex', 'issues', 'psychological', 'religious', 'touch', 'matter', 'kid', 'parents', 'drawn', 'more', 'more', 'talk', 'matter', 'Thus', 'end', 'come', 'out', 'closet', 'would', 'have', 'overcome', 'original', 'strictures', 'religion', 'also', 'be', 'willing', 'let', 'parents', 'feel', 'failures', 'theirrecent', 'attempts', 'discussing', 'matter', 'modern', 'hip', 'way', 'Coming', 'out', 'then', 'question', 'parents', 'idea', 'modern', 'hip', 'as', 'well', 'know', 'reactionary', 'types', 'matter', 'how', 'prejudicial', 'always', 'also', 'consider', 'very', 'with-it', 'modern', 'hip', 'would', 'be', 'lot', 'harder', 'South', 'Park', 'ethos', 'hilarious', 'already', 'bit', 'old', 'fashioned', 'pie-in-you-face', 'interjection', 'reality', 'characterized', 'old', 'way', 'being', 'Coming', 'out', 'now', 'not', 'only', 'coming', 'terms', 'yourselves', 'helping', 'pseudo-hip', 'parents', 'understand', 'reactionary', 'views', 'are', 'not', 'hip', 'are', 'just', 'worst', 'kind', 'dirty', 'skeezy', 'old', 'bubba', 'thinking', 'dressed', 'up', 'fancy', 'clothes', 'Not', 'how', 'people', 'want', 'see', 'lot', 'ask', 'kid', 'Where', 'South', 'Park', 'was', 'great', 'cultural', 'success', 'proving', 'could', 'laugh', 'whole', 'complicated', 'matter', 'coming', 'out', 'thoroughly', 'only', 'sad', 'upon', 'reflection', 'society', 'ability', 'laugh', 'have', 'become', 'more', 'complicated', 'whereas', 'one', 'would', 'think', 'opposite']",N/A

1034905,ASFY0ZEHPGPEQ,B000KLNLRI,Ryan Nay,"[0, 0]","This season marked the twilight of South Park's golden age, which I usually consider seasons 5-10, when the show was really on a roll.  Like many of the later seasons, season 9 can be a bit hit-or-miss, there are a couple turds here, but when they get a hit this season... they hit it clear out of the park.  The season started out slow...  ""Mrs. Garrison's Fancy New Vagina"" marked Mr. Garrison's transition into a post-op transsexual, and also marked a new low point in the show in terms of poor taste.  They tried really hard to make the show funny through shock value, which sometimes works, but in this case it didn't.  A few funny moments come in the form of sheer absurdity as Kyle's father is turned into a jewphin and Kyle gets a negroplasty.  ""Die Hippy, Die"" and ""Wing"" were similarly fairly weak- though each had funny moments.  The season picked up steam finally with ""Best Friends Forever,"" a poignant, timely, and hilarious examination of the Terry Schiavo case which aired just hours before she died in real life.  This episode was the one chosen that won South Park its very first, long overdue, emmy for best animated program.  Aside from ""The Death of Eric Cartman,"" which was also hilarious, the rest of the season was a bit ""meh"" until almost near the end when it really started gaining momentum again.  The last 3 episodes of the season are all classics and include one of the best endings in the show's history in ""Free Willzyx,"" what was up to that point the most controversial episode in the show's history in the form of ""Bloody Mary,"" and also the infamous Scientology/Tom Cruise episode ""Trapped in the Closet.""  Another one of the best endings in South Park history can be found in the episode ""Marjorine,"" though up until the ending that particular episode was pretty weak.",5,Some big hits and a few misses.,1272326400,"04 27, 2010",2010,1803,"['season', 'marked', 'twilight', 'South', 'Park', 'golden', 'age', 'usually', 'consider', 'seasons', '5-10', 'when', 'show', 'was', 'really', 'roll', 'many', 'later', 'seasons', 'season', '9', 'can', 'be', 'bit', 'hit-or-miss', 'are', 'couple', 'turds', 'here', 'when', 'get', 'hit', 'season', 'hit', 'clear', 'park', 'season', 'started', 'out', 'slow', 'Mrs.', 'Garrison', 'Fancy', 'New', 'Vagina', 'marked', 'Mr.', 'Garrison', 'transition', 'post-op', 'transsexual', 'also', 'marked', 'new', 'low', 'point', 'show', 'terms', 'poor', 'taste', 'tried', 'really', 'hard', 'make', 'show', 'shock', 'value', 'sometimes', 'case', 'did', ""n't"", 'A', 'few', 'funny', 'moments', 'come', 'form', 'sheer', 'absurdity', 'Kyle', 'father', 'turned', 'jewphin', 'Kyle', 'negroplasty', 'Die', 'Hippy', 'Die', 'Wing', 'were', 'similarly', 'fairly', 'weak-', 'had', 'funny', 'moments', 'season', 'picked', 'up', 'steam', 'finally', 'Best', 'Friends', 'Forever', 'poignant', 'timely', 'hilarious', 'examination', 'Terry', 'Schiavo', 'case', 'aired', 'just', 'hours', 'died', 'real', 'life', 'episode', 'was', 'one', 'chosen', 'won', 'South', 'Park', 'very', 'first', 'long', 'overdue', 'emmy', 'best', 'animated', 'program', 'Aside', 'Death', 'Eric', 'Cartman', 'was', 'also', 'hilarious', 'rest', 'season', 'was', 'bit', 'meh', 'almost', 'end', 'when', 'really', 'started', 'gaining', 'momentum', 'again', 'last', '3', 'episodes', 'season', 'are', 'classics', 'include', 'one', 'best', 'endings', 'show', 'history', 'Free', 'Willzyx', 'was', 'up', 'point', 'most', 'controversial', 'episode', 'show', 'history', 'form', 'Bloody', 'Mary', 'also', 'infamous', 'Scientology/Tom', 'Cruise', 'episode', 'Trapped', 'Closet', 'one', 'best', 'endings', 'South', 'Park', 'history', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'episode', 'Marjorine', 'up', 'ending', 'particular', 'episode', 'was', 'pretty', 'weak']",N/A
