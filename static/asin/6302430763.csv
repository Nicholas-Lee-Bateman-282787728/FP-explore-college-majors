During Manning's lifetime there were plans for some of her novels to be filmed but that did not transpire until 1987, several years after her death. At that time the BBC produced a brilliant mini-series called The Fortunes of War. Emma Thompson and Kenneth Branagh (who were later to marry and still later divorce) portrayed the characters of Harriet and Guy Pringle to such an effect that the viewer can feel these actors are indeed the Pringles (and by extension Manning and her husband).

The screenplay dragged the story out unnecessarily with inconsequential details and scenes while failing to provide essential details that would have helped understand some of the events. Although we wanted to see how the story ended, we couldn't wait for it to end. A voice over (from the author's viewpoint) would have helped.For all their famed talent, Emma Thompson and Kenneth Branagh disappointed also. Several other actors provided more interesting and effective performances. Thompson performed as if she suffered somnabulism in all but a handful of scenes. She seemed bored with the whole thing. It was hard to believe that her character could be so detached as the German army approached and invaded each of the cities where they resided. Branagh's performance was acting, not natural, until the scene near the end in which he breaks down in the hospital. Perhaps the person he portrayed was just that artificial, but it's hard to believe that he was. Branagh's method of acting is much more suited to a quasi-comedic role, like that of Gilderoy in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.We like to be drawn into a story, so that we care what happens to the characters.

They didn't know each other, but they both knew Guy Pringle.&quot; However, his portrayal becomes a bit shaky once the unflappable Brit Lit professor is finally forced to face the prospect of his greatest conceivable loss.Thompson is simply excellent as the more reserved Harriet, who finds to her dismay that her husband not only preaches socialism and the love of mankind but also lives it, with the result that he has little time or attention left over for her. He assures her when confronted that he loves her, but it appears to Harriet and the audience that what he loves is her unflagging willingness to understand and accomodate him. Happily, by the end we all appreciate Harriet's other qualities: her humor, spirit, courage, and compassion.Rupert Graves also stands out as the eager young soldier living in the shadow of his elder brother.

312480,A2BDZAU0Y4J6NB,6302430763,F. S. L'hoir,"[140, 141]","I was so pleased when ""Fortunes of War"" was released on DVD! When I first saw this splendid BBC television series, I rushed to the nearest bookstore (in Rome at the time) and bought Olivia Manning's mammoth Balkan and Levant trilogies, which I have since devoured at least three times (so much so that the paperback editions are falling apart). Reading, however, in no way lessens, but, instead, enhances one's enjoyment of ""Fortunes of War,"" which preserves the essence of Manning's novels. Visually stunning, the film recreates Bucharest and Athens on the brink of World War II, and then Cairo and Alexandria, as well as Damascus and Jerusalem, the outposts of the British Empire in the Levant. One step ahead of the advancing Nazi armies, Guy and Harriet Pringle, the film's central characters, are constantly uprooted and forced to be on the move.Guy, acted with affable understatement by Kenneth Brannagh, epitomizes the type of academic who constantly puts the wants of his students first. Friend to all the world, Guy Pringle remains totally oblivious to the needs of his newly-married bride. Harriet, played with a dry and subtle irony by Emma Thompson, must cope with setting up house, first, in a city that is about to fall to the juggernaut of the Third Reich; next, in a series of hotel rooms, each more seedy than the last; and finally, sharing digs in Cairo with an odd assortment of British expatriates (and their even odder friends and acquaintances who continually drift in and out of the premises). Guy simply cannot understand that Harriet might be miffed at his heedlessness. For example, after Guy offers her the female title role in Shakespeare's ""Troilus and Cressida,"" she suddenly discovers that he has taken the part away without telling her and has given it to Sophie, a Rumanian professional student and troublemaker who resents Harriet's presence, both in Bucharest and in Guy's life. It is not that Guy Pringle does not love his ""little monkey's paws,"" Harriet; he simply takes her for granted.Among the outstanding ensemble cast, two performances are memorable: those of Ronald Pickup and Alan Bennett.Pickup plays the incorrigible Prince Yakimov, a displaced Anglo-Russian aristocrat, long-since fallen on hard times. Pickup's performance is so poignantly nuanced that  the viewer is moved from loathing, to laughing--first at him and then with him--and finally to loving him. ""Poor Yaki"" resembles a spoiled but irrepressibly sweet and helpless child. Not even the much-imposed-upon Harriet can remain angry at a man who appears before her wearing one brown and one black shoe and then explains that he has another pair just like them at home.Alan Bennett plays the insufferably fussy Cambridge don, Professor Lord Pinkrose, who is always on the verge of giving his renowned lecture on Byron but who, for one reason or another, is always prevented from doing so. Bennett's performance does not make one love Pinkrose (nor should it); it does, however, make one recognize him (He often sits on dissertation committees!). With his smarmy herd of acolytes (including the odious Toby Lush and the insidious Dubidat), Pinkrose, who always darts a baneful glance in Harriet's direction, causes Guy so much trouble that the viewer is tempted to cheer when the Lord Professor finally gets his just desserts. Every film ought to have a character that one loves to hate, and Alan Bennett plays this one to perfection.The viewer seeking the wartime thrills of dogfighting Messerschmidts, exploding bombs, and action packed battle sequences should go watch ""Saving Private Ryan"" or a John Wayne movie. Even though the conflict in ""Fortunes of War"" is omnipresent, it is always just over the horizon. It nevertheless exerts a profound impact on the characters, both major and minor. It exerts an equally profound impact on the audience.  For the discerning viewer, who appreciates exceptional acting and remarkable characterization, ""Fortunes of War"" represents the epitome of cinematic storytelling.For Kenneth Brannagh and Emma Thompson, who acted together for the first time, this film represented ""the start of a beautiful friendship,"" both on film and in real life. Unfortunately, it was not to last, but ""Fortunes of War"" at least allows us to glimpse the brilliant start, and to be glad that their joint venture in film lasted as long as it did!",5,The Start of a Beautiful Friendship!,1134864000,"12 18, 2005",2005,4372,"['was', 'so', 'pleased', 'when', 'Fortunes', 'War', 'was', 'released', 'DVD', 'When', 'first', 'saw', 'splendid', 'BBC', 'television', 'series', 'rushed', 'nearest', 'bookstore', 'Rome', 'time', 'bought', 'Olivia', 'Manning', 'mammoth', 'Balkan', 'Levant', 'trilogies', 'have', 'devoured', 'least', 'three', 'times', 'so', 'much', 'paperback', 'editions', 'are', 'falling', 'apart', 'Reading', 'however', 'way', 'instead', 'one', 'enjoyment', 'Fortunes', 'War', 'essence', 'Manning', 'novels', 'Visually', 'stunning', 'film', 'Bucharest', 'Athens', 'brink', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'then', 'Cairo', 'Alexandria', 'as', 'well', 'Damascus', 'Jerusalem', 'outposts', 'British', 'Empire', 'Levant', 'One', 'step', 'ahead', 'advancing', 'Nazi', 'armies', 'Guy', 'Harriet', 'Pringle', 'film', 'central', 'characters', 'are', 'constantly', 'uprooted', 'forced', 'be', 'move.Guy', 'acted', 'affable', 'understatement', 'Kenneth', 'Brannagh', 'type', 'academic', 'who', 'constantly', 'students', 'first', 'Friend', 'world', 'Guy', 'Pringle', 'totally', 'oblivious', 'needs', 'newly-married', 'bride', 'Harriet', 'played', 'dry', 'subtle', 'irony', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'must', 'cope', 'setting', 'up', 'house', 'first', 'city', 'fall', 'juggernaut', 'Third', 'Reich', 'next', 'series', 'hotel', 'rooms', 'more', 'seedy', 'last', 'finally', 'sharing', 'digs', 'Cairo', 'odd', 'assortment', 'British', 'expatriates', 'even', 'odder', 'friends', 'acquaintances', 'who', 'continually', 'drift', 'premises', 'Guy', 'simply', 'can', 'not', 'understand', 'Harriet', 'might', 'be', 'miffed', 'heedlessness', 'example', 'Guy', 'female', 'title', 'role', 'Shakespeare', 'Troilus', 'Cressida', 'suddenly', 'discovers', 'taken', 'part', 'away', 'telling', 'given', 'Sophie', 'Rumanian', 'professional', 'student', 'troublemaker', 'who', 'Harriet', 'presence', 'Bucharest', 'Guy', 'life', 'not', 'Guy', 'Pringle', 'not', 'love', 'little', 'monkey', 'paws', 'Harriet', 'simply', 'granted.Among', 'outstanding', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'two', 'performances', 'are', 'memorable', 'Ronald', 'Pickup', 'Alan', 'Bennett.Pickup', 'incorrigible', 'Prince', 'Yakimov', 'displaced', 'Anglo-Russian', 'aristocrat', 'long-since', 'fallen', 'hard', 'times', 'Pickup', 'performance', 'so', 'poignantly', 'nuanced', 'viewer', 'moved', 'loathing', 'laughing', 'first', 'then', 'finally', 'loving', 'Poor', 'Yaki', 'spoiled', 'irrepressibly', 'sweet', 'helpless', 'child', 'Not', 'even', 'much-imposed-upon', 'Harriet', 'can', 'remain', 'angry', 'man', 'who', 'wearing', 'one', 'brown', 'one', 'black', 'shoe', 'then', 'pair', 'just', 'home.Alan', 'Bennett', 'insufferably', 'fussy', 'Cambridge', 'don', 'Professor', 'Lord', 'Pinkrose', 'who', 'always', 'verge', 'giving', 'renowned', 'lecture', 'Byron', 'who', 'one', 'reason', 'always', 'prevented', 'doing', 'so', 'Bennett', 'performance', 'not', 'make', 'one', 'love', 'Pinkrose', 'should', 'however', 'make', 'one', 'recognize', 'often', 'dissertation', 'committees', 'smarmy', 'herd', 'acolytes', 'including', 'odious', 'Toby', 'Lush', 'insidious', 'Dubidat', 'Pinkrose', 'who', 'always', 'baneful', 'glance', 'Harriet', 'direction', 'Guy', 'so', 'much', 'trouble', 'viewer', 'tempted', 'cheer', 'when', 'Lord', 'Professor', 'finally', 'just', 'desserts', 'Every', 'film', 'ought', 'have', 'character', 'one', 'hate', 'Alan', 'Bennett', 'one', 'perfection.The', 'viewer', 'seeking', 'wartime', 'thrills', 'dogfighting', 'Messerschmidts', 'exploding', 'bombs', 'action', 'packed', 'battle', 'sequences', 'should', 'go', 'watch', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'John', 'Wayne', 'movie', 'Even', 'conflict', 'Fortunes', 'War', 'omnipresent', 'always', 'just', 'horizon', 'nevertheless', 'profound', 'impact', 'characters', 'major', 'minor', 'equally', 'profound', 'impact', 'audience', 'discerning', 'viewer', 'who', 'exceptional', 'acting', 'remarkable', 'characterization', 'Fortunes', 'War', 'epitome', 'cinematic', 'storytelling.For', 'Kenneth', 'Brannagh', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'who', 'acted', 'together', 'first', 'time', 'film', 'represented', 'start', 'beautiful', 'friendship', 'film', 'real', 'life', 'Unfortunately', 'was', 'not', 'last', 'Fortunes', 'War', 'least', 'allows', 'glimpse', 'brilliant', 'start', 'be', 'glad', 'joint', 'venture', 'film', 'lasted', 'as', 'long', 'did']",N/A

312483,A106016KSI0YQ,6302430763,Jay Dickson,"[4, 4]","The BBC's 1987 seven-part miniseries based on Olivia Manning's BALKAN TRILOGY and LEVANT TRILOGY were the first pairing of Kenneth Branagh and Emma Thompson (who would soon wed and become each very famous internationally in his and her own right), and they've never been better as Guy and Harriet Pringle, an academic couple trapped ""on the wrong side of Europe"" during the early years of World War II. In Bucharest, for Guy's first job teaching English as a married man, the Pringles find themselves increasingly isolated, first by the movements of the Rumanian fascists in league with Hitler (the Iron Guard), and then by the invading German army; they become transplanted first to Athens and then to Cairo as the war continues, along with a changing group of other involuntary English exiles. The miniseries, like the books it is base on, is tremendously episodic, and sometimes you lose track of who's who in Guy's and Harriet's circle given the enormous cast of characters. Whereas the Manning novels (like that other great extensive roman a clef that covers the same period, Anthony Powell's DANCE TO THE MUSIC OF TIME) allow the characters to be joined by the sense of the ebb and flow of the author's strong prose style, here many of the episodes seem highly disjointed. Yet many of the moments within have been unforgettable to me for more than twenty years: the Pringles finding to their horror at a performance at the Bucharest Opera that the German influence has replaced ""Rigoletto"" with ""Tannhauser""; the final result in Cairo of Professor Lord Pinkrose's long-deferred lecture on Byron; the consequences when the likable but impossible sponger Prince Yakimov (Ronald Pickup, in a classic performance) indulges in a cigarette during an Athens air-raid; the strained humiliated goodbye of a Syrian who has shown Harriet the sights in Damascus when she leaves him to run off with her countrymen.The effect of the production is helped tremendously not only by the expensive sets and costumes (the BCC wanted to compete with the success of Granada Television's recent expensive miniseries adaptations of BRIDESHEAD REVISITED and THE JEWEL IN THE CROWN, and spared little) and by the terrific acting. Branagh has never been more charming as the irrepressible and platonically promiscuous Guy, a Marxist English teacher who makes everyone feel as if he's the most important person in the room, and Thompson has one of her signature roles as the lonely, long-suffering Harriet. One can genuinely fault the series for presenting World War II mostly as a bothersome nuisance to bourgeois, well-educated Englishmen; yet as so many novelists and filmmakers of the twentieth century were aware, few things have more appeal to audiences than young people in love separated and displaced by war.",4,"""The fortunes of war flow this way and that""",1256515200,"10 26, 2009",2009,2795,"['BBC', '1987', 'seven-part', 'miniseries', 'based', 'Olivia', 'Manning', 'BALKAN', 'TRILOGY', 'LEVANT', 'TRILOGY', 'were', 'first', 'pairing', 'Kenneth', 'Branagh', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'who', 'would', 'soon', 'wed', 'become', 'very', 'famous', 'internationally', 'own', 'right', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'better', 'Guy', 'Harriet', 'Pringle', 'academic', 'couple', 'trapped', 'wrong', 'side', 'Europe', 'early', 'years', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'Bucharest', 'Guy', 'first', 'job', 'teaching', 'English', 'married', 'man', 'Pringles', 'find', 'increasingly', 'isolated', 'first', 'movements', 'Rumanian', 'fascists', 'league', 'Hitler', 'Iron', 'Guard', 'then', 'invading', 'German', 'army', 'become', 'transplanted', 'first', 'Athens', 'then', 'Cairo', 'war', 'changing', 'group', 'other', 'involuntary', 'English', 'exiles', 'miniseries', 'books', 'base', 'tremendously', 'episodic', 'sometimes', 'lose', 'track', 'who', 'who', 'Guy', 'Harriet', 'circle', 'given', 'enormous', 'cast', 'characters', 'Manning', 'novels', 'other', 'great', 'extensive', 'roman', 'clef', 'same', 'period', 'Anthony', 'Powell', 'DANCE', 'TO', 'THE', 'MUSIC', 'OF', 'TIME', 'allow', 'characters', 'be', 'joined', 'sense', 'ebb', 'flow', 'author', 'strong', 'prose', 'style', 'here', 'many', 'episodes', 'seem', 'highly', 'disjointed', 'many', 'moments', 'have', 'been', 'unforgettable', 'more', 'twenty', 'years', 'Pringles', 'finding', 'horror', 'performance', 'Bucharest', 'Opera', 'German', 'influence', 'replaced', 'Rigoletto', 'Tannhauser', 'final', 'result', 'Cairo', 'Professor', 'Lord', 'Pinkrose', 'long-deferred', 'lecture', 'Byron', 'consequences', 'when', 'likable', 'impossible', 'sponger', 'Prince', 'Yakimov', 'Ronald', 'Pickup', 'classic', 'performance', 'cigarette', 'Athens', 'air-raid', 'strained', 'humiliated', 'goodbye', 'Syrian', 'who', 'shown', 'Harriet', 'sights', 'Damascus', 'when', 'run', 'off', 'countrymen.The', 'effect', 'production', 'helped', 'tremendously', 'not', 'only', 'expensive', 'sets', 'costumes', 'BCC', 'wanted', 'compete', 'success', 'Granada', 'Television', 'recent', 'expensive', 'miniseries', 'adaptations', 'BRIDESHEAD', 'REVISITED', 'THE', 'JEWEL', 'IN', 'THE', 'CROWN', 'spared', 'little', 'terrific', 'acting', 'Branagh', 'never', 'been', 'more', 'charming', 'irrepressible', 'platonically', 'promiscuous', 'Guy', 'Marxist', 'English', 'teacher', 'who', 'everyone', 'feel', 'most', 'important', 'person', 'room', 'Thompson', 'one', 'signature', 'lonely', 'long-suffering', 'Harriet', 'One', 'can', 'genuinely', 'fault', 'series', 'presenting', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'mostly', 'bothersome', 'nuisance', 'bourgeois', 'well-educated', 'Englishmen', 'yet', 'so', 'many', 'novelists', 'filmmakers', 'twentieth', 'century', 'were', 'aware', 'few', 'things', 'have', 'more', 'appeal', 'audiences', 'young', 'people', 'love', 'separated', 'displaced', 'war']",N/A

I don't like giving one star reviews.  Unfortunately, one star is all that this weak melodrama deserves.The point of the series (assuming the very best) is to provide the audience with a view of the sociological elements in the Balkans (specifically Romania) and the Levant (mostly Egypt) just prior to and during World War II.  To keep the series centered and provide a thread of interest, there is the precarious romance of the newly wed Guy and Harriet Pringle.The single ongoing source of tension for the Pringles is Guy's (as played by Kenneth Branaugh) relentless interest in teaching English and producing plays versus Harriet's (Emma Thompson) desire to understand the culture and occasionally be of some use to the people in whose lives she is immersed as well as to have a husband less emotionally distant.Swirling around all this are various characters whose main role is to represent different attitudes and positions of the times, caricatures for the most part, but occasionally interesting.Okay, I've tried to make this as interesting as possible.It doesn't work.  The romantic tensions of the Pringles are one dimensional and boring.  Over the course of an hour, perhaps even 90 minutes, the preposterous story might be sufficient.  But dragged out over the 8 years (plus or minus) of this seven hours series, it becomes as flat as week-old champagne.Branaugh is as his most dispassionate.  Supposedly this is the start of his shiny career, but the passion with which he infuses his later roles is virtually absent here.  A character so indifferent to the needs of his wife must be shown to have some other driving need to keep us interested.  Both characters must equally attract the sympathies of the viewer.  Here, Branaugh fails to accomplish this.  We seldom (never?) find ourselves rooting for his character.  Often, we just wish that Thompson in her role would just have one of the numerous affairs available to her.  And leave this uncaring jerk and get on with her life.And speaking of affairs, each of her potential affairs, at the penultimate moment of having one (but never closer - that won't do), is thwarted by an act of fate, a coincidence so bold and unlikely as to be laughable.  All the tension and potential emotional distress is erased in the absurdity of these authored contrivances.As a history lesson, the presentation is actually weakened by the melodrama entwined in the series.  The tragedy of Romania, the desperate decisions of politicians knowing there is little to do, the confusion of a populace divided among themselves as to the value of fascism, the attraction of socialism, the possibility of democracy -- all this is glossed over.  The position of Egypt with its bitter history with the British and its seduction by the Nazis -- this too becomes nothing more than one-liners and stereotypes.I have read that the books on which the series are based are excellent.  I am not commenting on them; I have not read them.It is the TV series that has failed, failed miserable.  I think only those who have the books would enjoy the series, because they would bring to their viewing an expansion of the story based on what they have read, and thus get more out of it.

312492,A39IY0JU5JI69G,6302430763,"Promise ""promise""","[0, 0]","There's so much to love in this series.  First, that it is a series; it needs time to convey the scope of the story.  The story, itself, is simple but rings true.  A young, idealistic British lit professor who has a deep hatred of Fascism returns to his teaching job in Bucharest with his new bride.  This is a man who sincerely attempts to walk his talk.  In an opening scene we see him give money to an elderly man, probably Jewish, who has been removed from his train compartment.We learn that he loves everyone, including, of course, his wife Harriet.  He takes in stray people the way she takes in a stray kitten, endangering himself in the process.  Harriet has a somewhat different view of life--less optimistic and more practical.  She comes to resent the fact that Guy's love for others takes away from his attention to her. When he isn't busy saving the world from the enemy, he has his bespectacled nose in a book, even in bed.  The poor woman feels neglected.The film is set in Bucharest, Athens, and Egypt and there are stunning shots of all locations.  Visually it's a total feast.Besides the principles, Guy and Harriet Pringle, there is a wonderfully colorful group of Brits who surround them.  We come to know and feel great affection for them, even with their faults and foibles, as they are shunted from place to place, always one jump ahead of the Nazis.  The most memorable is the Anglo-Russian Prince Yakimof, brilliantly played by Ronald Pickup.  The whole cast is first-rate, as we have come to expect from a BBC production.Reviewers who have read the novels from which this series was adapted complain that the character of Guy isn't faithful to the one in the book and state that the casting of Branagh in the part was a mistake.  Since I didn't read the book, I can't comment on that. To my eyes Branagh was truly brilliant, combining the qualities of the socially gregarious guy who knew and loved everyone with the sensitive academic who read John Donne aloud even as they were being transported on a rusty old freighter from one destination to another.  My only complaint was that his cluelessness regarding his wife was maybe somewhat overplayed, as we see him, night after night, with his nose in his book, even as his wife is languishing by his side in bed.The only disappointment for me, was the appearance of Emma Thompson as Harriet, whose story is the basis of the film.  I've loved and marvelled at her performances in everything else I've seen her in, so this was a let-down.  The script mentions her beauty and ""light"" in many places and wherever she went, men were attracted to her; however Thompson played down that aspect of the character.

It follows the lives of a British Literature Professor and his wife during their sojourn out of England during World War II.  The cinematography is stunning and clearly the series was filmed on location in Hungary, Greece, Egypt and Syria.  It is worth watching just for the spectacular scenery, but it has much more to offer.The professor and his wife are played by two of England's most distinguished actors, Kenneth Branagh and Emma Thompson, and both give sterling performances.  Branagh's character is complex, a contrast of selfishness and generosity, introvert and extravert, thoughtfulness and absent-mindedness.  His wife, steady, outgoing, generous and thoughtful, has a difficult time coping because most of the time he simply neglects her.The War rages all around them killing friends and threatening their own safety.  Forced to evacuate one war zone after another, they flee to different countries and seek to re-establish their lives.  One can only marvel at their tenacity to stay in such places, given the ever-present danger.Watching this is one of those experiences that when it ends, you wish there was one more episode.

The seven parts of the mini-series (6 plus hours in all of viewing) follow the fortunes of a young British Council English teacher, Guy Pringle, and his new wife, Harriet, through World War II.  The couple is living in Romania at the beginning of the war and flees to Greece and then Egypt to escape the Nazis.This is not a tale of fighting men on the front lines, but rather a domestic drama about civilians bearing up through the momentous events of war and the loss of friends and homes.  The miniseries takes its time; you may find parts one and two slow moving, but part three and four are edge-of-the-seat tense. Throughout are atmospheric touches and scenic photography -- not least of which are the wonderful eyes of Emma Thompson (Harriet). The series is readily believable: no hyperbole here, phony heroism, or false notes. The novels were auto-biographical and one can believe in the reality of the series.In the books Guy Pringle is an exasperating, generous, ebullient, near-sighted, Soviet-loving fool of a man. Kenneth Branagh's rendering of him is too restrained. Emma Thompson, however, is superb as his sensible lonely wife who finds marriage exhilarating at times but more often frustrating.  The greatest character of the series is the drunken spendthrift Prince Yakimov, wonderfully played by Ronald Pickup.  He's a Micawberish-character worthy of Dickens.It's a good series, not quite great because of the so-so portrayal of Guy Pringle by Branagh, but well worth viewing for a unique look at World War II.Smallchief",5,"The War in Romania, Greece, and Egypt",1149292800,"06 3, 2006",2006,1651,"['Fortunes', 'War', 'dramatization', 'six', 'Olivia', 'Manning', 'novels', 'Balkan', 'Trilogy', 'Levant', 'Trilogy', 'seven', 'parts', 'mini-series', '6', 'hours', 'viewing', 'follow', 'fortunes', 'young', 'British', 'Council', 'English', 'teacher', 'Guy', 'Pringle', 'new', 'wife', 'Harriet', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'couple', 'living', 'Romania', 'beginning', 'war', 'flees', 'Greece', 'then', 'Egypt', 'escape', 'Nazis.This', 'not', 'tale', 'fighting', 'men', 'front', 'lines', 'rather', 'domestic', 'drama', 'civilians', 'bearing', 'up', 'momentous', 'events', 'war', 'loss', 'friends', 'homes', 'miniseries', 'time', 'may', 'find', 'parts', 'one', 'two', 'slow', 'moving', 'part', 'three', 'four', 'are', 'edge-of-the-seat', 'tense', 'Throughout', 'are', 'atmospheric', 'touches', 'scenic', 'photography', 'not', 'least', 'are', 'wonderful', 'eyes', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'Harriet', 'series', 'readily', 'believable', 'hyperbole', 'here', 'phony', 'heroism', 'false', 'notes', 'novels', 'were', 'auto-biographical', 'one', 'can', 'believe', 'reality', 'series.In', 'books', 'Guy', 'Pringle', 'exasperating', 'generous', 'ebullient', 'near-sighted', 'Soviet-loving', 'fool', 'man', 'Kenneth', 'Branagh', 'rendering', 'too', 'restrained', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'however', 'superb', 'sensible', 'lonely', 'wife', 'who', 'marriage', 'exhilarating', 'times', 'more', 'often', 'frustrating', 'greatest', 'character', 'series', 'drunken', 'spendthrift', 'Prince', 'Yakimov', 'wonderfully', 'played', 'Ronald', 'Pickup', 'Micawberish-character', 'worthy', 'Dickens.It', 'good', 'series', 'not', 'quite', 'great', 'so-so', 'portrayal', 'Guy', 'Pringle', 'Branagh', 'well', 'worth', 'viewing', 'unique', 'look', 'World', 'War', 'II.Smallchief']",N/A
