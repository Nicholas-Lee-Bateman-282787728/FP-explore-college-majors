909566,A3GKU0NILLHDWQ,B0009OL894,A. Hickman,"[1, 1]","I was really looking forward to seeing this movie but was, frankly, disappointed.  I didn't object to the subject matter, and I didn't mind the way the producers shied away from a frank depiction of what the two brothers might get up to in bed.  I enjoyed the performances, especially those of Cole Williams (as Amos Lassen mentioned--he is Paul Williams' son, and more or less a ringer for him) and Bryce Johnson (who is paired again with Tom Gilroy and director Munch, this time as editor, in ""The Bluetooth Virgin""), and it was good to see Rain Phoenix in a rather substantive role, although she did seem a bit old for either brother.  No, I was disappointed because the film is by Christopher Munch, the director of ""Sleepy Time Gal"" and, most importantly, ""The Hours and Times,"" one of the best films ever to deal with the themes of sex ('60s style), celebrity, and the Beatles.  That film also dealt with a road trip, as well as with two young men discovering new aspects of their sexuality, but in that case the characters were based on two real-life celebrities: John Lennon and Brian Epstein.  I'm not sure why Munch chose to portray Harry and Max as teen idols; perhaps in a homage to his earlier film.  But it's a buzzkill here.  It's hard to care what happens to two characters who are more reminiscent of the Hanson brothers (for those of you who are too young to remember, Hanson was a pop group from Tulsa that fluttered teenage hearts in a series of videos in the 1990s) than of the Beatles.  One minute Max is putting the moves on Harry, the next it's Harry putting the moves on Max.  They have apparently connected sometime in the past, but their relationship is going nowhere now, and neither is this film.  Too bad, because the actors are obviously game.  I did like the tent scenes at the beginning, and I thought we might be in for a variation on ""Brokeback Mountain"" (which was not released until the following year), but Munch never lets his audience into the tent, so to speak, and we are left with a puzzle of a relationship that, frankly, isn't worth the unraveling.",3,Twenty-four Hours from Tulsa,1212624000,"06 5, 2008",2008,2093,"['was', 'really', 'looking', 'forward', 'seeing', 'movie', 'was', 'frankly', 'disappointed', 'did', ""n't"", 'object', 'subject', 'matter', 'did', ""n't"", 'mind', 'way', 'producers', 'shied', 'away', 'frank', 'depiction', 'what', 'two', 'brothers', 'might', 'get', 'up', 'bed', 'enjoyed', 'performances', 'especially', 'Cole', 'Williams', 'Amos', 'Lassen', 'mentioned', 'Paul', 'Williams', 'son', 'more', 'less', 'ringer', 'Bryce', 'Johnson', 'who', 'paired', 'again', 'Tom', 'Gilroy', 'director', 'Munch', 'time', 'editor', 'Bluetooth', 'Virgin', 'was', 'good', 'see', 'Rain', 'Phoenix', 'rather', 'substantive', 'role', 'did', 'seem', 'bit', 'old', 'brother', 'No', 'was', 'disappointed', 'film', 'Christopher', 'Munch', 'director', 'Sleepy', 'Time', 'Gal', 'most', 'importantly', 'Hours', 'Times', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'ever', 'deal', 'themes', 'sex', ""'60s"", 'style', 'celebrity', 'Beatles', 'film', 'also', 'road', 'trip', 'as', 'well', 'two', 'young', 'men', 'discovering', 'new', 'aspects', 'sexuality', 'case', 'characters', 'were', 'based', 'two', 'real-life', 'celebrities', 'John', 'Lennon', 'Brian', 'Epstein', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'why', 'Munch', 'chose', 'portray', 'Harry', 'Max', 'teen', 'idols', 'perhaps', 'homage', 'earlier', 'film', 'buzzkill', 'here', 'hard', 'care', 'what', 'two', 'characters', 'who', 'are', 'more', 'reminiscent', 'Hanson', 'brothers', 'who', 'are', 'too', 'young', 'remember', 'Hanson', 'was', 'pop', 'group', 'Tulsa', 'fluttered', 'teenage', 'hearts', 'series', 'videos', '1990s', 'Beatles', 'One', 'minute', 'Max', 'putting', 'moves', 'Harry', 'next', 'Harry', 'putting', 'moves', 'Max', 'have', 'apparently', 'connected', 'sometime', 'past', 'relationship', 'going', 'nowhere', 'now', 'film', 'Too', 'bad', 'actors', 'are', 'obviously', 'game', 'did', 'tent', 'scenes', 'beginning', 'thought', 'might', 'be', 'variation', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'was', 'not', 'released', 'following', 'year', 'Munch', 'never', 'audience', 'tent', 'so', 'speak', 'are', 'left', 'puzzle', 'relationship', 'frankly', ""n't"", 'worth', 'unraveling']",N/A
909567,A9Y947FCJZPVL,B0009OL894,Arcadio Bolaos,"[1, 2]","""Harry + Max"" is a story about two brothers: their lives, their childhood memories and also the seemingly incestuous nature of their relationship.But what is incest and why is it important to clarify the term? There is a basic incest, universally known as the Oedipus complex, the carnal union between mother and son, which is considered in many cultures the ultimate taboo. Basic incest, as Claude Levi-Strauss explains it, is only a way to resolve the impasse between the autochthony of man and sexual union. Autochthonous man means a man that is born from the Earth itself, and most cultures explain the origin of men and women in a similar way: a sacred plant or fruit gives birth to the first man, or man comes directly from a sacred land, a river or a lake. This mythical origin of man collides with the certainty that man is the product of a sexual union, and thus the Oedipus complex pretends to resolve this impasse.But there is another incest, a non-basic one, which focuses on forbidden relationships between members of the same family (brothers, sisters). And this incest certainly does not respond to an archetypical or mythical structure. It's only something that defies social boundaries. It's also a violation of law, a law that comes (like all primitive laws) from a consuetudinary norm. The law is indeed the consolidation of habits and costumes from any given people, and as they are mere practices they are neither right nor wrong.But before consuetudinary norm can thoroughly transform into law there are cracks. And it is between one of such cracks that Max, the younger brother, defies established limitations. He has always admired his older brother, but as adolescence strikes him he finds out that admiration soon turns into sexual desire. At the beginning of the film Harry doesn't live in the house anymore. He's a boy band star, he has had successful songs and he's famous. And Max is also immersed in the pop industry. They are both good looking and young, but nobody knows what their secret is. They seem to wander, at moments, in an in-between area of sexual ambiguity. As boy band stars they are the protagonists of young girls fantasies but are forever condemned by males as an effeminate product created to please a certain audience. It doesn't come as a shock to see that most girls enjoy these boy bands whereas guys are into different musical genres altogether. The movie elicits the possibility of Max engaging in heterosexual activity at the same time that his brother Harry tampers with the option of having sexual intercourse with an older man.Christopher Munch explores fissures in social structures and provides us with a tale of brotherly and non-platonic love, self-discovery and ambiguity. Whether or not these subjects are appropriately depicted by Munch is up to the spectator... But what can never be denied is Munch's courageous effort of swimming upstream with a story of a most peculiar incest: brother on brother.",3,Story of two brothers,1320537600,"11 6, 2011",2011,2967,"['Harry', '+', 'Max', 'story', 'two', 'brothers', 'lives', 'childhood', 'memories', 'also', 'seemingly', 'incestuous', 'nature', 'relationship.But', 'what', 'incest', 'why', 'important', 'clarify', 'term', 'basic', 'incest', 'universally', 'known', 'Oedipus', 'complex', 'carnal', 'union', 'mother', 'son', 'considered', 'many', 'cultures', 'ultimate', 'taboo', 'Basic', 'incest', 'Claude', 'Levi-Strauss', 'only', 'way', 'resolve', 'impasse', 'autochthony', 'man', 'sexual', 'union', 'Autochthonous', 'man', 'man', 'born', 'Earth', 'most', 'cultures', 'explain', 'origin', 'men', 'women', 'similar', 'way', 'sacred', 'plant', 'fruit', 'birth', 'first', 'man', 'man', 'directly', 'sacred', 'land', 'river', 'lake', 'mythical', 'origin', 'man', 'collides', 'certainty', 'man', 'product', 'sexual', 'union', 'thus', 'Oedipus', 'complex', 'pretends', 'resolve', 'impasse.But', 'incest', 'non-basic', 'one', 'forbidden', 'relationships', 'members', 'same', 'family', 'brothers', 'sisters', 'incest', 'certainly', 'not', 'respond', 'archetypical', 'mythical', 'structure', 'only', 'something', 'social', 'boundaries', 'also', 'violation', 'law', 'law', 'primitive', 'laws', 'consuetudinary', 'norm', 'law', 'indeed', 'consolidation', 'habits', 'costumes', 'given', 'people', 'are', 'mere', 'practices', 'are', 'neither', 'right', 'wrong.But', 'consuetudinary', 'norm', 'can', 'thoroughly', 'transform', 'law', 'are', 'cracks', 'one', 'such', 'cracks', 'Max', 'younger', 'brother', 'defies', 'established', 'limitations', 'always', 'admired', 'older', 'brother', 'adolescence', 'strikes', 'out', 'admiration', 'soon', 'sexual', 'desire', 'beginning', 'film', 'Harry', ""n't"", 'live', 'house', 'anymore', 'boy', 'band', 'star', 'had', 'successful', 'songs', 'famous', 'Max', 'also', 'immersed', 'pop', 'industry', 'are', 'good', 'looking', 'young', 'nobody', 'what', 'secret', 'seem', 'wander', 'moments', 'in-between', 'area', 'sexual', 'ambiguity', 'boy', 'band', 'stars', 'are', 'protagonists', 'young', 'girls', 'fantasies', 'are', 'forever', 'condemned', 'males', 'effeminate', 'product', 'created', 'please', 'certain', 'audience', ""n't"", 'come', 'shock', 'see', 'most', 'girls', 'enjoy', 'boy', 'bands', 'whereas', 'guys', 'are', 'different', 'musical', 'genres', 'altogether', 'movie', 'possibility', 'Max', 'engaging', 'heterosexual', 'activity', 'same', 'time', 'brother', 'Harry', 'tampers', 'option', 'having', 'sexual', 'intercourse', 'older', 'man.Christopher', 'Munch', 'fissures', 'social', 'structures', 'tale', 'brotherly', 'non-platonic', 'love', 'self-discovery', 'ambiguity', 'not', 'subjects', 'are', 'appropriately', 'depicted', 'Munch', 'spectator', 'what', 'can', 'never', 'be', 'denied', 'Munch', 'courageous', 'effort', 'swimming', 'upstream', 'story', 'most', 'peculiar', 'incest', 'brother', 'brother']",N/A

Not your run-of-the-mill gay movie, for sure.In ""Harry and Max"" (2004), Max is a blomde 16 year old singer featured in all of the teen heartthrob magazines, and is managed by his controlling materialistic mother.  What's more, Max is closeted gay, and has a longtime crush on his 23 year old brother Harry, a former teen heartthrob making the transition from a boyband to a solo artist.  Harry has his ""issues"" too ... latent homosexuality (with a heavy dose of denial), an expert at destroying relationships he should be preserving, is very immature for his age, and he's an alcoholic.  After a couple of years devoting time to their separate careers, Harrry and Max get a chance to bond over a weekend camping trip, and update each other on their lives and loves which, for Max, includes a recently ended affair with a 40 year old teacher.  They argue, more than usual even for brothers, but their deep feelings for each other remain the centerpiece of the film expertly directed by Christopher M&uuml;nch, who also wrote it.Newcomers Bryce Johnson (whom we'll see this fall in the cop drama TV series ""Still Life"") and Cole Williams (""8 Rules"") play Harry and Max, respectively.  Interesting casting includes Rain Phoenix as Harry's former girlfriend, now a collaborator for Max, as well as Michelle Phillips (of the Mamas & the Papas) as Harry and Max's controlling mom.  Rated R for subject matter only.  Available on DVD, and might make an appearance on pay cable at some point.

Both boys are in the music business, although that aspect of the movie is barely touched upon.The 2 meet up, the viewer assumes after several years apart, and take off for a camping trip in the mountains.  Quickly out from the cold and into a tent they go.  Max quickly and clearly makes his love for his older brother Harry known.  The 2 discuss their first encounter about 2 years earlier, in I believe the Bahamas, or Bermuda.  It doesn't matter where, but we hear about it a few times.Over 60 minutes later, and we have met a few friends, an older lover / friend Max once had, and their mother.  Other then Harry and Max, all the other parts are minor ones.  The focus in the movie is 2 guys dealing with sexual feelings for each other, both sort of afraid of coming out completely.  And needless to say, the ""taboo"" of being brothers in love.  If the story was really captivating, then we might be inclined to strike up a conversation on that topic.  In comparison, also watch ""L.I.E."" or ""Eban and Charley"" if you want some controversy.  Harry and Max is a bit too clean-cut, and kind of boring.With but 10 minutes left in the film, we jump several calendar years, and several light years in the story ahead.  The end is so disconnected from the first hour of the film, one is left going ""huh, where the heck did this come from?""All that said, the characters are good, the filming and sound are excellent for what appears to be a low-budget film.  But I've seen many a low-budget film, and this one lacked the story line to keep me involved.  The acting and direction just missed the mark.  I couldn't connect with the characters on a deeper level.  Certainly the angst Max feels about being gay is very real for a 16 year old coming of age, and in the spotlight, although, once again, we never really saw either of them in the spotlight.  I found Max's character the strongest in the film, for the most part.  Harry was a bit out there at times.I reiterrate, it wasn't a bad film, and I would never say ""don't see it""; just don't expect to feel moved by emotion, happy or sad.  I laughed a few times, but I don't think that was intended in the movie.On a plus note, the DVD has a nice behind-the-scenes film, which makes me (the reviewer) feel bad about not being able to give the film a better rating.

Not while the steaming pile that is the American version of ""Godzilla"" (aka: ""101 Ways to Not Make a Good Movie"") is still polluting the world.This movie, as you know by now, is about a pair of male teen idol pop stars. One of them, Max, is clearly basically gay and knows it, the other is probably gay and still figuring it out. The brothers are both in love with each other to a great extent, and have on occasion had sex with one other.Needless to say, complications arise from this.The acting by both the leads is quite good, particularly Cole Williams, who looks quite tasty as a blond (especially when making out with Bryce Johnson and especially with his shirt gone). The dialogue is a little stilted, and in some ways felt more like a play than a movie. Also, I could have done without the awkward threesome attempt towards the end of the movie, though the final coda was good.What keeps this movie from better than three stars? Well, it was short (74 minutes), the diaglogue was, as mentioned, a little stilted, and then there's the coda. Plus the price I paid was a little steep for such a short film, though the extras are alright.Beyond that... something seemed to be faintly off with the film. I'm not sure what. It seemed like it couldn't decide if it wanted to be a comedy or a drama or both. Admitedly, there are those who say it's hard to play sibling incest for laughs, but I say they just haven't tried.Still, despite the flaws, the movie was good and worth watching.

909572,A15Q9YEG1XPEJN,B0009OL894,Get What We Give,"[11, 12]","Harry and Max is an odd little film. It's a film that, quite frankly, I'm surprised any American director/producer/film company/actor would tackle. It's a film that has brotherly incest as an active thread running through it. The trouble is, the incest angle really isn't reason enough for the film - there needs to be another, stronger plot around which to build the film.Bryce Johnson as Harry and Cole Williams (singer/songwriter/sometimes actor Paul Williams' son) as Max are not only engaging and believable as brothers, but downright talented actors. You can see the wheels turning in Max's head as he mulls things over and over. Harry, a burgeoning alcoholic, seems sufficiently numbed to reality.There is no deficiency when it comes to the acting ability of this cast of quite surprisingly fine actors. Rain Phoenix (River and Joachin's little sister) is believable as the boys' friend/lover and Michelle Phillips does a believable job as the pushy/b*t*hy stage mom.What is on the screen is thoughtful and thought provoking. My problem with the film stems from what ISN'T on the screen.The film is about 23 year old Harry (a boy band pop idol with a waning popularity) and 16 year old Max (an up and coming boy band pop idol). Harry lives in New York and Max lives at home with their mother - a woman with whom Harry does not get along. Where Dad is, is anyone's guess.Max freely acknowledges that he is gay. Further, to Harry, he freely acknowledges that he loves his brother Harry, but in a romantic sense as well as a brotherly sense. We can tell that Harry feels the same, but on some level knows that it is wrong. (He allows Max to have oral sex with him, but doesn't encourage it) Max is so young that he doesn't really care. Max wants Harry and he's fairly blatant about that. Harry wants Max (he masturbates looking at publicity pictures of Max in a teen magazine), but can't bring himself to commit - instead he seduces the 40 year old former yoga instructor who slept with Max several years earlier. It would seem Harry wants to learn how this older man managed to create a ""connection"" with Max that he, himself, seems unable to develop...or is it simply that he doesn't want to be one upped by his little brother and he wants to know just what it was that Max experienced with this man?Max tries the straight side and sleeps with Nikki (Rain Phoenix), Harry's former girlfriend. After this happens, for some reason, Harry feels the need to divulge to Nikki that he and Max have previously been lovers.Why? To what end? Max is able to move on with his life, but Harry seems destined to pine after his little brother and drift further and further into alcoholism.What's the message of the movie? Is there supposed to be a message? Frankly, it doesn't need a message, but since the script is somewhat fragmented, it seems to be trying to provide us with a message.Now, don't get me wrong, I liked the movie just fine. However, it irritated the devil out of me, because the very realistic conversations between Harry and Max never fully delivered the complete message to me, the viewer. While realistic, in that the two of them reference incidents in their past, we, the audience are never privy to those incidents. They are only vaguely referred to - as two people who share the same past would quite believably do. However, WE don't know what happened. There should have been a flashback sequence (however brief) of the often alluded to incident in Bermuda where the boys initially consumated their incestuous relationship.What's the background situation with Harry and Roxanne, his New York girlfriend? A couple more lines of dialogue could have cleared this up.Why did Harry dump Nikki? A couple more lines of dialogue could have cleared this up too. We just know it ended.In the beginning, we have no reason or reference to understand that Harry and Max are in the music industry. They do not feel compelled to sing or play music. If Harry is as driven as Max says, and Harry is writing his own music, then wouldn't he have at least dragged along a guitar on their weekend camping trip?In the last scene of the film, we are to believe that Max has not only moved on with his life in the music industry, but he has found a male lover with whom he is completely satisfied. From a psychological standpoint, this out of character. He initiated the relationship with his brother and pushed for it to go further, time and again. Harry also wanted the relationship, but just didn't know how to allow himself to ""be there"". Harry is now the one pining for Max and now Max is completely rebuffing him and confidently so.

909573,A328S9RN3U5M68,B0009OL894,Grady Harp,"[3, 4]","HARRY AND MAX goes where films have dared (at least American films): consensual incestuous relationships between two brothers.  Writer/director Christopher M&uuml;nch ('The Sleepy Time Gal', 'The Hours and Times', 'Color of a Brisk and Leaping Day') has previously proved that he is unafraid to take on tough subject matter and make it poetically beautiful.  In HARRY AND MAX he has created an intelligent reverie about hopes, dreams, expectations, disappointments,  and filial love that is as fascinating as it is unique.Max (Cole Williams) is a 16-year-old teen idol whose career is managed by his mother (Michelle Phillips).  His 23-year-old brother Harry (Bryce Johnson) began the family trend toward teen band idols and now is living on his past glories in music trips to the still-adoring masses in Japan while he sinks into alcoholism.  Max longs for companionship and more with Harry  and as the film opens we find them on a long-awaited camping trip in California's San Gabriel mountains, exploring the old Mt Lowe Railway. Their similarities and differences unfold in natural, unforced conversation and when night falls and they retire to their tent, Max makes physical overtures to Harry, overtures Harry does not resist.  It is clear through occult references to a family outing in Bermuda that the two have had intimate relations but the details are intentionally left foggy. For the remainder of the weekend trip the two brothers confide their family problems (Harry never felt as accepted as Max and left home early on), Max's gay affair with 40-year-old Josiah (Tom Gilroy), Harry's current affair with Roxanne (Roni Deitz) and his mishandled affair with Nikki (Rain Phoenix), a girl who subsequently married and divorced and is now a close friend with Max.Once the inherent tensions are blocked out, the two brothers explore the current paramours of the other: Harry seduces Josiah, Max attempts to seduce Nikki, and the secret of the brothers' incestuous relationship becomes open knowledge.  Harry truly loves Max and Max returns that love but feels Harry must find his own life without leaning on Max's new idol popularity. The final solutions are unveiled in a time jump two years later when Harry and Max and Max's lover Jordan (Justin Zachary) meet in a conversation that more fully explains the differences and similarities between the two brothers.Christopher M&uuml;nch keeps the story rolling with casual precision, using effective sun-drenched flashbacks to illuminate the boys' childhood.  He has garnered fine performances from his cast: Cole Williams and Bryce Johnson are superb and cameo roles by Michelle Phillips, Justin Zachary, and Tom Gilroy are first rate.  The only weak link is Rain Phoenix who mimes her way through the pivotal role of Nikki, reducing the tension when it should be building.  The sexual scenes are handled with utmost sophistication, sensual without being graphic.  In all, this is a terrific little film, small in budget and technique but enormous in thought and impact.  Highly recommended.

909577,A8QG61LYK0XO1,B0009OL894,JUST A REVIEWER2,"[8, 11]","(PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS REVIEW IS BASED ON MORE THAN ONE VIEWING OF THE FILM)(1)  While 'good attempt' is an acceptable way in which to describe this film, there are most definitely three words which better describe it:  HONEST.........FOOLISH............BRAVE.  All three adjectives apply to the producers/director, but most certainly they apply to the two male leads (their futures in film likely are not now as assured as they might otherwise have been prior to undertaking these particular roles.....despite relatively accomplished performances).  Also, it's important to say of this work that, while instances of incest have occurred in earlier films of various genres, this reviewer is unaware of any mainline film script which has been as open or blatant in picturing such an ancient taboo  (however, see paragraph 3, below).(2)  Much of the reaction to this film will, undoubtedly, be one of abhorrence.  Yet can there be any question that the type of sibling love and sexual behavior exhibited here has occurred countless times throughout human history  (whether there are those who like thinking so, or not).  And whether that's been brother to brother, or sister to sister, it is behavior which has occurred, sometimes as a one-time or an infrequent event, other times most certainly for life.  (At least it's not a behavior which can be claimed to ""muddy the gene pool"", such as a brother/sister relationship might).  But (and here's a vital point) in incest, as in most homosexual events, at the end we are left with the question of who will admit to it.  Surely we must all see that, throughout time, those who've railed the loudest, and behaved the most indignantly regarding homosexual behavior, very often were and are those who earlier on in their lives either took part in such behavior or possessed such feelings.  Strong societal ""norms"", of course, force these individuals to, later on, express repellent feelings when confronted with such sexual behavior.  Possibly, but perhaps in a much lesser number of instances, this might be just as true of incest behavior.(3)  To be completely objective about this film, there is, indeed, a fourth word which needs be applied to the work:  FUDGED.  Viewers will note that on several occasions the scriptwriters/director have ""pulled back"" from showing more complete scenes of the physical love that could have been expected to be taking place between these two brothers (how often did you, the viewer, see one or other pull back from physically responding when you knew that, in real life, there likely would have been no hesitation?).  In other words, while it wouldn't have been necessary to go into porn mode, there were a number of instances of ""talking the talk"" but very little in the way of ""walking the walk.""  In fact it might be said that there was more ""directness"" of physical behavior in the much more secondary relationship scene, involving Harry and a former Yoga instructor of Max's, than there was between the two leads.  Too bad, for Harry and Max were really who this movie was supposed to be all about.(NOTE that, in the Director/Leading Performers Commentary track for this film on DVD, the issue of there not being more sexual follow-through is 'spoken at' but never actually 'addressed' ---although actor, Cole Williams, does express his surprise that there had always seemed to be a ""pulling back"" from these activities, once they'd started)(4)  In the end and at the very least, however, this film has to be recognized as a ""start"" at being more open in showing and describing a behavior that is as old as man and woman.",3,Behavior as old as man and woman............,1122508800,"07 28, 2005",2005,3608,"['PLEASE', 'NOTE', 'THIS', 'REVIEW', 'IS', 'BASED', 'ON', 'MORE', 'THAN', 'ONE', 'VIEWING', 'THE', 'FILM', '1', 'attempt', 'acceptable', 'way', 'describe', 'film', 'are', 'most', 'definitely', 'three', 'words', 'better', 'describe', 'HONEST', 'FOOLISH', 'BRAVE', 'three', 'adjectives', 'apply', 'producers/director', 'most', 'certainly', 'apply', 'two', 'male', 'leads', 'futures', 'film', 'likely', 'are', 'not', 'now', 'as', 'assured', 'might', 'otherwise', 'have', 'been', 'prior', 'undertaking', 'particular', 'roles', '..despite', 'relatively', 'accomplished', 'performances', 'Also', 'important', 'say', 'work', 'instances', 'incest', 'have', 'occurred', 'earlier', 'films', 'various', 'genres', 'reviewer', 'unaware', 'mainline', 'film', 'script', 'been', 'open', 'blatant', 'picturing', 'such', 'ancient', 'taboo', 'however', 'see', 'paragraph', '3', '2', 'Much', 'reaction', 'film', 'will', 'undoubtedly', 'be', 'one', 'abhorrence', 'can', 'there', 'be', 'question', 'type', 'sibling', 'love', 'sexual', 'behavior', 'exhibited', 'here', 'occurred', 'countless', 'times', 'human', 'history', 'are', 'who', 'like', 'thinking', 'so', 'not', 'been', 'brother', 'brother', 'sister', 'sister', 'behavior', 'occurred', 'sometimes', 'one-time', 'infrequent', 'event', 'other', 'times', 'most', 'certainly', 'life', 'least', 'not', 'behavior', 'can', 'be', 'claimed', 'muddy', 'gene', 'pool', 'such', 'brother/sister', 'relationship', 'might', 'here', 'vital', 'point', 'incest', 'most', 'homosexual', 'events', 'end', 'are', 'left', 'question', 'who', 'will', 'admit', 'Surely', 'must', 'see', 'time', 'who', ""'ve"", 'railed', 'loudest', 'behaved', 'most', 'indignantly', 'regarding', 'homosexual', 'behavior', 'very', 'often', 'were', 'are', 'who', 'earlier', 'lives', 'took', 'part', 'such', 'behavior', 'possessed', 'such', 'feelings', 'Strong', 'societal', 'norms', 'course', 'force', 'individuals', 'later', 'express', 'repellent', 'feelings', 'when', 'confronted', 'such', 'sexual', 'behavior', 'Possibly', 'perhaps', 'much', 'lesser', 'number', 'instances', 'might', 'be', 'just', 'true', 'incest', 'behavior', '3', 'be', 'completely', 'objective', 'film', 'indeed', 'fourth', 'word', 'be', 'applied', 'work', 'FUDGED', 'Viewers', 'will', 'note', 'several', 'occasions', 'scriptwriters/director', 'have', 'pulled', 'back', 'showing', 'more', 'complete', 'scenes', 'physical', 'love', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'expected', 'be', 'taking', 'place', 'two', 'brothers', 'how', 'often', 'did', 'viewer', 'see', 'one', 'other', 'pull', 'back', 'physically', 'responding', 'when', 'knew', 'real', 'life', 'likely', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'hesitation', 'other', 'words', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'necessary', 'go', 'porn', 'mode', 'were', 'number', 'instances', 'talking', 'talk', 'very', 'little', 'way', 'walking', 'walk', 'fact', 'might', 'be', 'said', 'was', 'more', 'directness', 'physical', 'behavior', 'much', 'more', 'secondary', 'relationship', 'scene', 'involving', 'Harry', 'former', 'Yoga', 'instructor', 'Max', 'was', 'two', 'leads', 'Too', 'bad', 'Harry', 'Max', 'were', 'really', 'who', 'movie', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'NOTE', 'Director/Leading', 'Performers', 'Commentary', 'track', 'film', 'DVD', 'issue', 'there', 'not', 'being', 'more', 'sexual', 'follow-through', ""'spoken"", 'never', 'actually', ""'addressed"", 'actor', 'Cole', 'Williams', 'express', 'surprise', 'had', 'always', 'seemed', 'be', 'pulling', 'back', 'activities', 'once', ""'d"", 'started', '4', 'end', 'very', 'least', 'however', 'film', 'be', 'recognized', 'start', 'being', 'more', 'open', 'showing', 'describing', 'behavior', 'as', 'old', 'man', 'woman']",N/A

Wiersma ""ksmichael""","[13, 13]","This is an interesting and thought-provoking look at love and affection in a form most people would be uncomfortable with.  The subject of love and sex between two brothers is a compelling and convincingly-portrayed premise for this film which sounds and looks like every other gay film except for this detail.In fact, the story plays out like many other gay love stories where the two lovers fight and bicker, fool around with other people (partly out of need and partly just to get even closer to the true object of affection.)So, it seems there are a few too many unexplored and uninteresting characters in the way of the real story and it seems like everyone wants to have sex with everyone else...except the two brothers really just want each other, sexually and emotionally.Why this occurs is not really well explored or supported, except that their parents are presumed to be unfeeling and cold and perhaps they were each other's only real comfort.The leads' acting is generally good and the chemistry between them seems real.  There are some problems with the continuity of the film and the extent to which it depends on narration to move the film along and explain the story.  The fact that you need narration to know what is going on is symptomatic of the screenwriting and direction deficiencies. Also, the sequence at the end will satisfy few and the film ends with a quiet and somewhat humiliating thud.So, while the story and the study in affection are compelling and relatively well-crafted, the sum of the parts is frustrating and as much an excercise in self-destruction as in love.I recommend this film for it's unique story and the generally gentle handling of the subject-matter, but there are some big holes in this film that leave it only partly intact.",3,Compelling but unpolished,1124496000,"08 20, 2005",2005,1775,"['interesting', 'thought-provoking', 'look', 'love', 'affection', 'form', 'most', 'people', 'would', 'be', 'uncomfortable', 'subject', 'love', 'sex', 'two', 'brothers', 'compelling', 'convincingly-portrayed', 'premise', 'film', 'other', 'gay', 'film', 'detail.In', 'fact', 'story', 'out', 'many', 'other', 'gay', 'stories', 'where', 'two', 'lovers', 'fight', 'bicker', 'fool', 'other', 'people', 'partly', 'need', 'partly', 'just', 'get', 'even', 'closer', 'true', 'object', 'affection', 'So', 'are', 'few', 'too', 'many', 'unexplored', 'uninteresting', 'characters', 'way', 'real', 'story', 'everyone', 'have', 'sex', 'everyone', 'else', 'two', 'brothers', 'really', 'just', 'want', 'other', 'sexually', 'emotionally.Why', 'occurs', 'not', 'really', 'well', 'explored', 'supported', 'parents', 'are', 'presumed', 'be', 'unfeeling', 'cold', 'perhaps', 'were', 'other', 'only', 'real', 'comfort.The', 'leads', 'acting', 'generally', 'good', 'chemistry', 'real', 'are', 'problems', 'continuity', 'film', 'extent', 'narration', 'move', 'film', 'explain', 'story', 'fact', 'need', 'narration', 'know', 'what', 'going', 'symptomatic', 'screenwriting', 'direction', 'deficiencies', 'Also', 'sequence', 'end', 'will', 'satisfy', 'few', 'film', 'quiet', 'somewhat', 'humiliating', 'thud.So', 'story', 'study', 'affection', 'are', 'compelling', 'relatively', 'well-crafted', 'sum', 'parts', 'frustrating', 'as', 'much', 'excercise', 'self-destruction', 'love.I', 'recommend', 'film', 'unique', 'story', 'generally', 'gentle', 'handling', 'subject-matter', 'are', 'big', 'holes', 'film', 'leave', 'only', 'partly', 'intact']",N/A

So this movie was different. I felt the acting was pretty good. There are some very long dialog scenes that are very difficult to do. Most movies have a lot of cuts so the actors don't really have to learn their lines. But there are very few cuts in this movie and LOTS of talking so the actors had to do a lot of studying. The dialog is also the movie's down side. The two characters in this movie can get really annoying. You wanna yell at the screen for them to just SHUT UP and stop whining. That's all they ever do is complain. They fight like real brothers do so in that way it's realistic. But annoying. The other downside is the ending. It kinda just drops off. The older brother stops seeing his younger brother. That's kind of a bummer. I would have liked to see them on good terms in the end.But anyway, it's not the best movie I've ever seen but I enjoyed it.",4,"""You have to sheath your teeth""",1126656000,"09 14, 2005",2005,997,"['give', 'props', 'movie', 'being', 'something', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'before', 'are', ""n't"", 'too', 'many', 'sibling', 'incest', 'movies', 'out', 'there', 'movie', 'was', 'different', 'felt', 'acting', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'are', 'very', 'long', 'dialog', 'scenes', 'are', 'very', 'difficult', 'do', 'Most', 'movies', 'have', 'lot', 'cuts', 'actors', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'have', 'learn', 'lines', 'are', 'very', 'few', 'cuts', 'movie', 'LOTS', 'talking', 'actors', 'had', 'do', 'lot', 'studying', 'dialog', 'also', 'movie', 'down', 'side', 'two', 'characters', 'movie', 'can', 'get', 'really', 'annoying', 'wan', 'na', 'yell', 'screen', 'just', 'SHUT', 'UP', 'stop', 'whining', 'ever', 'do', 'complain', 'fight', 'real', 'brothers', 'do', 'so', 'way', 'realistic', 'annoying', 'other', 'downside', 'ending', 'kinda', 'just', 'drops', 'off', 'older', 'brother', 'stops', 'seeing', 'younger', 'brother', 'kind', 'bummer', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'see', 'good', 'terms', 'end.But', 'anyway', 'not', 'best', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'enjoyed']",N/A

Technically, there is some incest in the film, but isn't it really just about sexuality??Two young guys who are in the music industry are not going to be normal people.  Their lives are so different from everyone else.  Their sexuality is different as well.  Overall, both Harry and Max are lost souls looking to grab onto to something or someone good.And when your life is as strange as theirs is, I guess you might consider grabbing onto the one person--the only person--you think you truly know and trust--your brother.",5,It really isn't about incest,1127865600,"09 28, 2005",2005,575,"['Everyone', 'think', 'movie', 'incest', 'Technically', 'incest', 'film', ""n't"", 'really', 'just', 'sexuality', 'Two', 'young', 'guys', 'who', 'are', 'music', 'industry', 'are', 'not', 'going', 'be', 'normal', 'people', 'lives', 'are', 'so', 'different', 'everyone', 'else', 'sexuality', 'different', 'as', 'well', 'Overall', 'Harry', 'Max', 'are', 'lost', 'souls', 'looking', 'grab', 'something', 'someone', 'good.And', 'when', 'life', 'as', 'strange', 'theirs', 'guess', 'might', 'consider', 'grabbing', 'one', 'person', 'only', 'person', 'think', 'truly', 'know', 'trust', 'brother']",N/A
