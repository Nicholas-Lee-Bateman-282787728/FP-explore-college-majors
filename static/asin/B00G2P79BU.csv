1676203,A3DBUN9EMFMUV1,B00G2P79BU,"Elias B. ""The Atlanta Fried Critic""","[7, 11]","It was last year when I went with my family to go see the reboot of &#34;The Three Stooges.&#34; For the entire 5-10 minute car trip home, I could not stop laughing, to the point where I had to make myself focus on my breathing so I wouldn't choke. The point being, that was the last time I remember a movie making me laugh so riotously, and I thought it would take years for me to find another. Low and behold, Johnny Knoxville and the rest of the &#34;Jackass&#34; crew nearly made me pass out from laughter with their latest masterpiece of raunch.&#34;Bad Grandpa&#34; follows Irving, a crotchety old man who has recently been widowed, much to his delight. His aspirations of sleeping with everything living, breathing and female are cut short, however, by his daughter being sent to prison (again.) This wouldn't be a problem if she didn't have a son whose deadbeat father was across the country, but much to the grandfather's chagrin, that's precisely the case. And so begins a cross-country journey with Irving and eight year-old Billy, who can never quite seem to go anywhere without getting in some sort ridiculous antics. Whether it being trying to move Irving's dead wife from his trunk to a hotel room, or putting Billy in drag to win money in a child beauty pageant, the hijinks in this movie are among the best in a modern comedy.What makes these moments even more special is that, for the most part, Knoxville and company made the very wise decision to stage this in a &#34;Borat&#34;-like fashion. This means that all of the shocked, bewildered, and offended reactions you see on camera were not staged, which is surprising when taking into consideration some of the things that they get away with here. A funeral is crashed in the most heinously inappropriate way possible, a kiddie ride goes haywire and crashes through a store window, and a farting competition in a restaurant results in explosive wall defecation. Just when you think this movie can't get any more over the top, it winks at you and laughs, then does something completely unexpected and out of the blue. It keeps upping its own ante, which is exactly what makes these kinds of flicks work.Even more of a delight is the fact that there is, believe it or not, a soul to this movie. The cross-country road trip with Irving and Billy is refreshingly touching at times, showing some of the signature heart that Knoxville typically displays in his non-&#34;Jackass&#34; outings. The writers wisely stayed away from making fun of the mother and father's situation too much, probably realizing that this is a very real reality for many children. Instead, we get to see an old geezer and a reckless little boy duke it out, then realize over time that they actually are very fond of each other. It's pretty touching at times, and while it certainly isn't anything groundbreaking, it's still a sort of feel-good movie.That isn't to say everything here is great. Some gags get overused a bit too much, such as Billy trying to pick up women for his grandfather, and the continuous usage of the dead grandmother prop. There are also occasionally jokes that just don't work that well, like Knoxville wrangling a fish that has a massive human penis. Also, it feels like the movie could have perhaps benefited from a slightly shorter running time, by about 10 minutes or so. Still, these are very minor complaints for a movie that is, by and large, one of the funniest I've seen.When I saw this film, I was laughing harder than anybody in the entire theater. There were tears streaking down my face during some of the more outrageous gags, and even some of the not-so-funny stuff managed to elicit some strong chuckles. And at the end of the whole experience, right through the hilarious outtakes, none of it really made me feel bad for any of the bystanders involved (you'll get to see why during the credits), and I felt happy at the ultimate outcome for these two likable oafs of characters.&#34;Bad Grandpa&#34; is not going to win any awards, but it is going to make you bust a gut and care about the characters, which is more than I can say for most comedies these days.Grade: B",4,"Bad Grandpa, Good Times",1383350400,"11 2, 2013",2013,4151,"['was', 'last', 'year', 'when', 'went', 'family', 'go', 'see', 'reboot', '34', 'Three', 'Stooges.', '34', 'entire', '5-10', 'minute', 'car', 'trip', 'home', 'could', 'not', 'stop', 'laughing', 'point', 'where', 'had', 'make', 'focus', 'breathing', 'would', ""n't"", 'choke', 'point', 'being', 'was', 'last', 'time', 'remember', 'movie', 'making', 'so', 'riotously', 'thought', 'would', 'take', 'years', 'find', 'Low', 'behold', 'Johnny', 'Knoxville', 'rest', '34', 'Jackass', '34', 'crew', 'nearly', 'made', 'pass', 'out', 'laughter', 'latest', 'masterpiece', 'raunch.', '34', 'Bad', 'Grandpa', '34', 'Irving', 'crotchety', 'old', 'man', 'who', 'recently', 'been', 'widowed', 'much', 'delight', 'aspirations', 'sleeping', 'everything', 'living', 'breathing', 'female', 'are', 'cut', 'short', 'however', 'daughter', 'being', 'sent', 'prison', 'again', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'problem', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'son', 'deadbeat', 'father', 'was', 'country', 'much', 'grandfather', 'chagrin', 'precisely', 'case', 'so', 'cross-country', 'journey', 'Irving', 'eight', 'year-old', 'Billy', 'who', 'can', 'never', 'quite', 'seem', 'go', 'anywhere', 'getting', 'sort', 'ridiculous', 'antics', 'being', 'trying', 'move', 'Irving', 'dead', 'wife', 'trunk', 'hotel', 'room', 'putting', 'Billy', 'drag', 'win', 'money', 'child', 'beauty', 'pageant', 'hijinks', 'movie', 'are', 'best', 'modern', 'comedy.What', 'moments', 'even', 'more', 'special', 'most', 'part', 'Knoxville', 'company', 'made', 'very', 'wise', 'decision', 'stage', '34', 'Borat', '34', '-like', 'fashion', 'shocked', 'bewildered', 'offended', 'reactions', 'see', 'camera', 'were', 'not', 'staged', 'surprising', 'when', 'taking', 'consideration', 'things', 'get', 'away', 'here', 'funeral', 'crashed', 'most', 'heinously', 'inappropriate', 'way', 'possible', 'kiddie', 'ride', 'haywire', 'crashes', 'store', 'window', 'farting', 'competition', 'restaurant', 'results', 'explosive', 'wall', 'defecation', 'Just', 'when', 'think', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'more', 'top', 'laughs', 'then', 'something', 'completely', 'unexpected', 'blue', 'upping', 'own', 'ante', 'exactly', 'what', 'kinds', 'flicks', 'work.Even', 'more', 'delight', 'fact', 'believe', 'not', 'soul', 'movie', 'cross-country', 'road', 'trip', 'Irving', 'Billy', 'refreshingly', 'touching', 'times', 'showing', 'signature', 'heart', 'Knoxville', 'typically', 'non-', '34', 'Jackass', '34', 'outings', 'writers', 'wisely', 'stayed', 'away', 'making', 'fun', 'mother', 'father', 'situation', 'too', 'much', 'probably', 'realizing', 'very', 'real', 'reality', 'many', 'children', 'Instead', 'get', 'see', 'old', 'geezer', 'reckless', 'little', 'boy', 'duke', 'out', 'then', 'realize', 'time', 'actually', 'are', 'very', 'fond', 'other', 'pretty', 'touching', 'times', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'anything', 'groundbreaking', 'still', 'sort', 'feel-good', 'movie.That', ""n't"", 'say', 'everything', 'here', 'great', 'gags', 'get', 'overused', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'such', 'Billy', 'trying', 'pick', 'up', 'women', 'grandfather', 'continuous', 'usage', 'dead', 'grandmother', 'prop', 'are', 'also', 'occasionally', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'work', 'well', 'Knoxville', 'wrangling', 'fish', 'massive', 'human', 'penis', 'Also', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'perhaps', 'benefited', 'slightly', 'shorter', 'running', 'time', '10', 'minutes', 'so', 'Still', 'are', 'very', 'minor', 'complaints', 'movie', 'large', 'one', 'funniest', ""'ve"", 'seen.When', 'saw', 'film', 'was', 'laughing', 'harder', 'anybody', 'entire', 'theater', 'were', 'tears', 'streaking', 'down', 'face', 'more', 'outrageous', 'gags', 'even', 'not-so-funny', 'stuff', 'managed', 'elicit', 'strong', 'chuckles', 'end', 'whole', 'experience', 'right', 'hilarious', 'outtakes', 'none', 'really', 'made', 'feel', 'bad', 'bystanders', 'involved', ""'ll"", 'get', 'see', 'why', 'credits', 'felt', 'happy', 'ultimate', 'outcome', 'two', 'likable', 'oafs', 'characters.', '34', 'Bad', 'Grandpa', '34', 'not', 'going', 'win', 'awards', 'going', 'make', 'bust', 'gut', 'care', 'characters', 'more', 'can', 'say', 'most', 'comedies', 'days.Grade', 'B']",N/A

If, on the other hand, you are open-minded and seek a different flavor of comedy then you&#8217;re in luck.As many know, the MTV show &#8220;Jackass&#8221; celebrated outrageously bad behavior wrapped in the guise of mind-numbing stupid, and many times dangerous, stunts.  The bent mind behind that, of course, was one Johnny Knoxville.  That show was best consumed in small servings as it tested the bounds of taste.  The show ran its course, but Knoxville didn&#8217;t fade into the night.  It&#8217;s been a while since the show and the &#8220;cash-in&#8221; movie.  So, the time could be right for a revival of sorts.While jumping off of Jackass, Bad Grandpa is a very different animal.  It&#8217;s a fictitious story even as it intersperses some almost stunt-like vignettes as the story unfolds.  The bad taste is wholly intact.  The question of just how much the, supposedly uninformed, normal people appearing really know looms large.

I can watch TruTV&#8217;s World Dumbest&#8230; series for an inhumanly long amount of time. As a connoisseur of stupidity gone public I had high expectations for Bad Grandpa. I wasn&#8217;t disappointed.A typical Jackass movie is just one stunt after another. I actually liked Bad Grandpa better because the film weaved the stunts in such a way that it told a story. The loose plot was this: a guy&#8217;s wife dies, so he needs to get his grandson away from the child&#8217;s no-good mother (his daughter) and into the hands of his no-good father.As you can see, there&#8217;s plenty of room here for playing pranks on unsuspecting folks (the funeral for Bad Grandpa&#8217;s wife, the behavior of his daughter at the funeral, the video conference in a coffee shop with the son-in-law, and many more.)Along the way, the usual happens, but it&#8217;s always unpredictable: Grandpa does and says outrageous things and innocent people who witness it are left shaking their heads or gasping in horror. Bad Grandpa&#8217;s grandson was hilarious, too. He even got in on the act with the stunt at the climax. Like the best pranks, there was also a bit of a statement, but I&#8217;ll say no more so I don&#8217;t spoil it.I generally avoid comedies because they are too often some ex-SNL cast member performing excruciatingly long versions of their already done-to-death skits. The Jackass crew and Johnny Knoxville are not so tone-deaf, so I hope to see more like movies this.A micro-mini spoiler follows: During the credits, you get to see the reactions of the people once they are told that they are part of a film.

1676302,A3V5O5G3I1T2NX,B00G2P79BU,Mike,"[38, 41]","Synopsis:  Irving Zisman (played by Johnny Knoxville) is a recent widower who finds out he must also take care of his 8-year-old grandson Billy (Jackson Nicoll) after finding out his daughter has to go back to prison for a parole violation.  Intending to celebrate his newfound bachelorhood by living a life of total debauchery, Irving makes the plan to drive from Nebraska to North Carolina in an effort to leave Billy with his deadbeat dad Chuck (Greg Harris), who agrees to take Billy in solely because he'll get child support from the state for doing so (Irving also plans on disposing of his dead wife along the way, so her body accompanies them in the trunk for the entire drive.)  Though Irving sees Billy to be a nuisance, they both manage to form a bond with each other as they get into a myriad of antics along the way.  Will Irving leave Billy with his deadbeat dad, or will have have a change of heart?  And what in the world will happen to Irving's dead wife?When I saw the previews for the film, I figured it was going to be weak because what was advertized on TV wasn't that laugh out loud funny.  Upon seeing the film, however, it was clear most of it couldn't be shown because it was too hot for TV. I laughed hard and often throughout seeing this movie.  Just when I thought they couldn't have topped it further, they took it up to a whole other level.  Jackson Nicholl was the perfect counterpart to Johnny Knoxville in this case, as he was as up to task on conducting pranks as any of the veteran Jackass crew would have been.  Kudos to everyone who got pranked yet weren't too stuck on themselves to appear in the film; the credits were long because everyone who agreed to allow their likeness to be used on camera received an actor credit as themselves.  Though the movie was wrought with bad manners, there were also elements that showed how real people still do good in the world on a day-to-day basis (such as a church group who was willing to grieve with a lone widower, or a biker group who stood up for children.)Though people with more prudent tastes may be turned off by some of the vulgarity, fans of Jackass or Borat will undoubtedly love this film.

Oleson,"[0, 0]","There may be spoilers.Writer, star and original jackass Johnny Knoxville eschews his normal companions and their plot-less hijinks for a boy and a journey.  The story is simple.  Irving Zisman (Knoxville), an 86 year old recently widowed (co-writer Spike Jonze) grandfather.  At the funeral, Irving's daughter (Georgina Cates) drops off her 8 year old son, Billy (a game Jackson Nicoll) on her way to prison where she'll spend the next 6 months.  Irving is going to deliver Billy to the boy's bumpkin dad (Greg Harris) several hundred miles away in South Carolina.  The trip is a hoot.Along the way Irving and Billy engage a bar filled with black male strippers, a couple of FedEx/UPS type clerks unwilling to ship Billy in a carton, funeral home mourners and sympathetic bikers in a bar.  All this while transporting his wife's body (Jonze) in the trunk of a Lincoln coupe.  It's a Lincoln even if the steering wheel said Ford.  Perhaps the funniest, if unoriginal, scene comes when Irving enters Billy in one of those repulsive beauty pageants designed for young girls.It would appear that throughout the movie, only a few actors were in on the shenanigans and the real fun comes as the bystanders react.  It's priceless.  This couldn't have been pulled off without the Oscar nominated (not kidding) make up work of Stephen Prouty and some great comedic performances by Knoxville and young Nicoll.  The Jeff Tremaine directed movie isn't for everyone as there are plenty of jokes involving bodily functions and the nether regions but I was laughing throughout the picture.The Blu ray disc comes in 1080P with a 1.78:1 aspect ratio.  Don't expect eye popping HD here as many of the scenes are shot with well hidden small cameras.  Still it's all watchable and as good as to be expected.  Much like the video, the DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track is about as good as it can be.  Hidden mics, some distant, occasionally have a difficult time picking up nuances.  I have no complaints.  Subtitles are available in English SDH, French, Spanish and Portuguese.  Extras include several behind-the-scene shorts, alternative takes, deleted scenes, a DVD and a digital copy.  Several outtakes and the reaction of the unknowing participants, after being told what was going on, run during the closing credits.",4,(BLU RAY REVIEW) 3 1/2 stars for this Oscar nominated comedy.

Johnny Knoxville (actually, this is the first time I watched his movie) is very believable, entertaining and engaging as the 86 year old Irving.Throughout the movie he pulls of many funny gags. I definitely did get quite a few laughs and would rate this 5 out of 10 and would give it the two and a half star option if Amazon made it available to me.I can't imagine I could give it more because the whole movie smacks of amateurishness and some poor acting by supporting cast, particularly the 'penguin' incident. That guy threatens to bash him or whatever, but he's facing away from the camera, and it's clear why, because he can't keep a straight face.Many of the gags are very telegraphed, and occasionally it feels like the people being pranked are onto it before the audience can get a truly hilarious reaction of 'outrage'.Some of the pranks are poorly executed, particularly the post office episode, which takes some of the fun out.That said, there are also times when people are fully serious and it will definitely make you laugh.Bad Grandpa is okay as a modern gross-comedy.

As the two share a prank fueled road trip, they find an unexpected bond through a series of wildly funny pranks on a clueless public.REVIEW: At one point in the latest prank fueled hijinks adventure from Johnny Knoxville there is a real sense of danger. It involves an actor playing an abusively hateful dad who displays his lack of tolerance in front of the wrong crowd. It is such an unnerving scene that I found it hard to believe the prank wasn't completely staged. Certainly it isn't a first to wonder how on earth something doesn't go horribly wrong in prankster cinema, yet this was particularly tense. This awe-inspired insanity helps make BAD GRANDPA a shockingly funny ninety minutes that will have you shaking your head at the unbelievably bold humor which plays out. Even still you may find yourself rooting for the films odd couple leading men, Irving Zisman (Knoxville) and his grandson Billy (Jackson Nicoll).With the previous JACKASS films - as well as the MTV series - the comedy relied simply on the pranks or stunts. What sets BAD GRANDPA aside is the inclusion of a narrative. The story revolves around a young boy named Billy whose mother is going to prison. Thankfully Grandpa steps in in order to bring him to his father. The parents are the epitome of white trash and of course Gramps is far from the greatest role model. As the two travel cross country, they get into a number of strange and oftentimes hilarious adventures. As outrageous as Knoxville may be, this entire experiment would not have worked nearly this well if it wasn't for Nicoll. The young actor - who had previously appeared in FUN SIZE with Knoxville - connects almost too well with the ""86 year old"" whom he takes this journey with. And yes, the kid steals the show.The many exploits include a rigged kiddie ride, a wedding disrupted and a funeral gone wrong. As well there are a number of scenes not in the trailer that are utterly hilarious, moments that I won't give away. However, if you have watched the trailer, one of the highlights is most definitely a children's beauty pageant... you will never think of ""Cherry Pie"" by Warrant the same again. Nicoll takes on this challenge without abandon and it works. Yet it is the reaction of the parents who parade their young girls out in real life which is what makes it all the more uncomfortable. At one point, one of the contestants and her mother describe it being a little weird that a grandfather is bringing his ""daughter."" This entire sequence is one of the most insanely riotous moments ever created by the good folks behind JACKASS.As we get to know both Billy and Grandpa, there are a number of scenes of the two together in a car usually getting on each other's nerves. This is the only time where the film sometimes doesn't live up to its potential. The two actors work extremely well together, yet these bits of dialogue lack genuine heart and occasionally feel like filler. We get early on that Gramps is a jerk of an old man who begins to really truly love his grandkid so there is nothing all that surprising or impactful here. In fact, the moments when they are not annoying each other and suddenly become a ""team"" of sorts, it worked far better. Even still, what we really want to see is a series of outrageous antics that will have us laughing in the aisles and thankfully there is enough of that.This year there have been a handful of really terrific comedies including THE WORLD'S END as well as THIS IS THE END. And while BAD GRANDPA may not be my favorite of the three I have to say if you are in the mood to just laugh, this is simply the funniest movie of the year. Knoxville is of course terrific as Zisman - a character he has taken on a number of times in the past - but it is young Jackson Nicoll's fearless performance that really steals the show. It is also exciting to see Knoxville and company expand the idea behind JACKASS and create a story that mostly works. In the end, Irving Zisman and Billy make for a uniquely entertaining modern day ""Odd Couple"" with tons of the trashy stuff that JACKASS fans have come to expect.[...] by JimmyO",5,Bad Grandpa,1382745600,"10 26, 2013",2013,4246,"['PLOT', 'When', 'young', 'boy', 'mother', 'sentenced', 'prison', 'good', 'old', 'Grandpa', 'bring', 'child', 'good', 'father', 'two', 'share', 'prank', 'fueled', 'road', 'trip', 'find', 'unexpected', 'bond', 'series', 'wildly', 'funny', 'pranks', 'clueless', 'public.REVIEW', 'one', 'point', 'latest', 'prank', 'fueled', 'hijinks', 'adventure', 'Johnny', 'Knoxville', 'real', 'sense', 'danger', 'actor', 'playing', 'abusively', 'hateful', 'dad', 'who', 'lack', 'tolerance', 'front', 'wrong', 'crowd', 'such', 'unnerving', 'scene', 'found', 'hard', 'believe', 'prank', 'was', ""n't"", 'completely', 'staged', 'Certainly', ""n't"", 'first', 'wonder', 'how', 'earth', 'something', ""n't"", 'go', 'horribly', 'wrong', 'prankster', 'cinema', 'yet', 'was', 'particularly', 'tense', 'awe-inspired', 'insanity', 'make', 'BAD', 'GRANDPA', 'shockingly', 'funny', 'ninety', 'minutes', 'will', 'have', 'shaking', 'head', 'unbelievably', 'bold', 'humor', 'out', 'Even', 'still', 'may', 'find', 'rooting', 'films', 'odd', 'couple', 'leading', 'men', 'Irving', 'Zisman', 'Knoxville', 'grandson', 'Billy', 'Jackson', 'Nicoll', '.With', 'previous', 'JACKASS', 'films', 'as', 'well', 'MTV', 'series', 'comedy', 'relied', 'simply', 'pranks', 'stunts', 'What', 'BAD', 'GRANDPA', 'aside', 'inclusion', 'narrative', 'story', 'around', 'young', 'boy', 'named', 'Billy', 'mother', 'going', 'prison', 'Thankfully', 'Grandpa', 'steps', 'order', 'bring', 'father', 'parents', 'are', 'epitome', 'white', 'trash', 'course', 'Gramps', 'far', 'greatest', 'role', 'model', 'two', 'travel', 'cross', 'country', 'get', 'number', 'strange', 'hilarious', 'adventures', 'As', 'outrageous', 'Knoxville', 'may', 'be', 'entire', 'experiment', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'worked', 'nearly', 'well', 'was', ""n't"", 'Nicoll', 'young', 'actor', 'who', 'had', 'previously', 'appeared', 'FUN', 'SIZE', 'Knoxville', 'almost', 'too', 'well', '86', 'year', 'old', 'whom', 'journey', 'yes', 'kid', 'show.The', 'many', 'exploits', 'include', 'rigged', 'kiddie', 'ride', 'wedding', 'disrupted', 'funeral', 'gone', 'wrong', 'As', 'well', 'are', 'number', 'scenes', 'not', 'trailer', 'are', 'utterly', 'hilarious', 'moments', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'However', 'have', 'watched', 'trailer', 'one', 'highlights', 'most', 'definitely', 'children', 'beauty', 'pageant', 'will', 'never', 'think', 'Cherry', 'Pie', 'Warrant', 'same', 'again', 'Nicoll', 'challenge', 'abandon', 'reaction', 'parents', 'who', 'parade', 'young', 'girls', 'out', 'real', 'life', 'what', 'more', 'uncomfortable', 'one', 'point', 'one', 'contestants', 'mother', 'describe', 'being', 'little', 'weird', 'grandfather', 'bringing', 'daughter', 'entire', 'sequence', 'one', 'most', 'insanely', 'riotous', 'moments', 'ever', 'created', 'good', 'folks', 'JACKASS.As', 'get', 'know', 'Billy', 'Grandpa', 'are', 'number', 'scenes', 'two', 'together', 'car', 'usually', 'getting', 'other', 'nerves', 'only', 'time', 'where', 'film', 'sometimes', ""n't"", 'live', 'up', 'potential', 'two', 'actors', 'work', 'extremely', 'well', 'together', 'yet', 'bits', 'dialogue', 'lack', 'genuine', 'heart', 'occasionally', 'feel', 'filler', 'get', 'early', 'Gramps', 'jerk', 'old', 'man', 'who', 'really', 'truly', 'love', 'grandkid', 'so', 'nothing', 'surprising', 'impactful', 'here', 'fact', 'moments', 'when', 'are', 'not', 'annoying', 'other', 'suddenly', 'become', 'team', 'sorts', 'worked', 'far', 'better', 'Even', 'still', 'what', 'really', 'want', 'see', 'series', 'outrageous', 'antics', 'will', 'have', 'laughing', 'aisles', 'thankfully', 'enough', 'that.This', 'year', 'there', 'have', 'been', 'handful', 'really', 'terrific', 'comedies', 'including', 'THE', 'WORLD', 'END', 'as', 'well', 'THIS', 'END', 'BAD', 'GRANDPA', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'favorite', 'three', 'have', 'say', 'are', 'mood', 'just', 'laugh', 'simply', 'funniest', 'movie', 'year', 'Knoxville', 'course', 'terrific', 'Zisman', 'character', 'taken', 'number', 'times', 'past', 'young', 'Jackson', 'Nicoll', 'fearless', 'performance', 'really', 'show', 'also', 'exciting', 'see', 'Knoxville', 'company', 'expand', 'idea', 'JACKASS', 'create', 'story', 'mostly', 'end', 'Irving', 'Zisman', 'Billy', 'make', 'uniquely', 'entertaining', 'modern', 'day', 'Odd', 'Couple', 'tons', 'trashy', 'stuff', 'JACKASS', 'fans', 'have', 'come', 'expect.', '[', ']', 'JimmyO']",N/A
