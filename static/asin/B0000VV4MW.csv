And while &quot;retarded&quot; doesn't really seem like a word efficent enough to describe a film, I feel that there is no other way. The cast of actors are so bad, that I found myself cringe-laughing through the entire film. Maybe the dialogue is partly to blame, I mean, how bad does a film have to be, if some of the longest conversations go something like this.( Girl:&quot;What are you listening to; sounds like pretty regualar music.It doesn't sounds special at all&quot;.Boy:&quot;Sometimes it's nice not to be special&quot;. Girl:&quot;Jump off the roof&quot;.) And that's just me telling you; I can't decide whats worse, the lines themselves, or the absolutely atrocious manner in which the actors deliver their lines. I mean,most of the film isn't meant to be funny; and yet, I was literally wetting my pants during some of the &quot;serious&quot; moments.I seriously cannot stress enough how cringingly bad this film is. When I read the reviews that were raving on about this film in a serious manner, I thought that the whole web had decided to play a personal joke on me; see that's why I give it three stars. If there was ever a movie that was so,so,so,so, And I mean sosososos bad that it was actually good in a way, then Camp is that movie.The acting is so bad, the dialogue is so cheesy, and well...bad, that you cannot help but laugh at the ridiculousness of it all. And the ending? My gosh, the expression on the main character's face is priceless.I seriously cannot put into any words how unbelievably stupid this film was.Now I'm going to pretend I never saw all those glowing reviews taking this film seriously.And to all you decent people-you cannot miss this film.I laughed harder than I have ever laughed in my life simply because it was so bad.Talk about an unintentional comedy.I still keep telling myself that the whole movie was a joke.",3,I HAVE NO WORDS,1084838400,"05 18, 2004",2004,2026,"['film', 'cast', 'have', 'fantastic', 'vocal', 'talent', 'song', 'selections', 'were', 'great', 'film', 'number', 'one', 'most', 'retarded', 'film', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'quot', 'retarded', 'quot', ""n't"", 'really', 'seem', 'word', 'efficent', 'enough', 'describe', 'film', 'feel', 'other', 'way', 'cast', 'actors', 'are', 'so', 'bad', 'found', 'cringe-laughing', 'entire', 'film', 'Maybe', 'dialogue', 'partly', 'blame', 'mean', 'how', 'bad', 'film', 'have', 'be', 'longest', 'conversations', 'go', 'something', 'Girl', 'quot', 'What', 'are', 'listening', 'sounds', 'pretty', 'regualar', 'music.It', ""n't"", 'sounds', 'special', 'quot', 'quot', 'nice', 'not', 'be', 'special', 'quot', 'Girl', 'quot', 'Jump', 'roof', 'quot', 'just', 'telling', 'ca', ""n't"", 'decide', 'whats', 'worse', 'lines', 'absolutely', 'atrocious', 'manner', 'actors', 'deliver', 'lines', 'mean', 'most', 'film', ""n't"", 'meant', 'be', 'funny', 'yet', 'was', 'literally', 'wetting', 'pants', 'quot', 'serious', 'quot', 'seriously', 'can', 'not', 'stress', 'enough', 'how', 'cringingly', 'bad', 'film', 'When', 'read', 'reviews', 'were', 'raving', 'film', 'serious', 'manner', 'thought', 'whole', 'web', 'had', 'decided', 'play', 'personal', 'joke', 'see', 'why', 'give', 'three', 'stars', 'was', 'ever', 'movie', 'was', 'so', 'so', 'so', 'so', 'mean', 'sosososos', 'bad', 'was', 'actually', 'good', 'way', 'then', 'Camp', 'movie.The', 'acting', 'so', 'bad', 'dialogue', 'so', 'cheesy', 'well', 'bad', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'laugh', 'ridiculousness', 'ending', 'My', 'gosh', 'expression', 'main', 'character', 'face', 'priceless.I', 'seriously', 'can', 'not', 'put', 'words', 'how', 'unbelievably', 'stupid', 'film', 'was.Now', ""'m"", 'going', 'pretend', 'never', 'saw', 'glowing', 'reviews', 'taking', 'film', 'seriously.And', 'decent', 'people-you', 'can', 'not', 'miss', 'film.I', 'laughed', 'harder', 'have', 'ever', 'laughed', 'life', 'simply', 'was', 'so', 'bad.Talk', 'unintentional', 'comedy.I', 'still', 'keep', 'telling', 'whole', 'movie', 'was', 'joke']",Camp

The cast is made of aspiring actors playing aspiring actors.....what could be more appropriate?  Granted their acting skills aren't polished.  But they are portraying actors in musical theater.....their voices are what matters.  And I have to say everyone in the film had fantastic singing voices.  I am glad Camp wasn't cast with young pop stars turned actors (Britney Spears, Justin Timberlake, the Olsen Twins, Bow Wow). This cast, imperfections and all, was truer to the form.Even if you don't appreciate musical theater, the theme of kids growing up and trying to find their place in the world is a key part of this movie.What I appreciate most about Camp is how it portrays teens as having aspirations and goals in life.  It's not one of those teen-exploitation films where teenagers are portrayed as being pot smoking, sex-obsessed, and souless (i.e. American Pie).  We need more films that challenge teens, without being ridiculousely wholesome.

Yet, I'm going to recommend this film to you.  Why?  The singing performances of these young actors are quite astonishingly breathtaking.Most notably there's the opener, ""How Shall I See You Through My Tears,"" recorded (you find out in the extras) in the late, late evening in some bonechilling cold.  The DVD also contains a version of the song done by the cast at the premiere.  No lip-synching here.  These are real performers.Also good are ""Here's Where I Stand"" (very emotional and well-staged...you see the performer and the reaction of her hard-to-please Dad in the audience) and the rousing cast ensemble piece ""Want of a Nail.""There's also a short piece from 'Dreamgirls' that is too funny to describe here.

787472,A342YAXL116N5A,B0000VV4MW,Dennis!,"[14, 23]","Let's be clear from the very beginning:  The only redeeming feature to this movie was the incredible music and stage scenes.  According to the DVD extras, the cast really did its own singing for the show (they went into their recording studios then later lip-synched to their own voices), so for that alone, the talent is amazing and worth a watch.The acting, however, is dull and listless; the plot, thin, trite, and insanely weak.  Sure, the movie is supposed to be about the whole ""accept people for who they are"" theme, but the plot unfolds in such a formulaic manner, leading to its own forced and therefore incredible conclusion, that feeling any joy or sympathy for these characters is difficult.The movie focuses a majority of its attention on Vlad, a cute boy whom the entire camp (boys and girls) develops an instant collective crush on.  Vlad makes clear from the very beginning that he's straight, pretty much by bedding a girl early on (it's not entirely clear whether they actually have sex or just engage in some heavy third base action), then dating another girl, Ellen, pretty much out of pity.  In the meantime, he can't stop flirting with Michael, the gay boy who bears all the psychological scars of being beaten and otherwise mistreated at school for his homosexuality.  I don't know if this is supposed to be considered charming, or cute, or funny, or the essense of coming of age, but it made my skin crawl.  This kid was a boy-slut, and his charm and good looks couldn't make him look like an angel after all the stuff he pulled.(By the way, it's interesting to note that the movie makes clear that Vlad is the only straight boy at the camp that summer... but then all the gay boys except Michael float off into the background after that.  Where did the other gay boys go?  Did they not have other compelling story lines?)The subplot involving a super-talented girl whose parents can't stop calling her fat is wildly transparent and could be predicted from miles away.  From the moment we meet her -- she's greeted at the bus drop-off point by a friend from the previous summer who says, ""So glad you could make it!  I thought your parents were sending you to Weight Watchers camp!"" -- we can tell where it's all headed.  Of course, we also find out that her parents have wired her jaw shut to help her to lose weight.  Apart from being just plain cruel and borderline child abuse, what the heck is a girl supposed to do at a camp for the dramatic arts when she can't open her mouth to speak?!?And then there are the other, stranger subplots which seem to have no purpose at all:  Jill, the bitchy diva-in-training who not only has no friends save for the sycophantish Fritzi (and what was up with that strange idol worship?), but appears not to even want them, finally pushes the aforementioned Fritzi to the edge, resuling in some well-deserved comeuppance.  And there's that cute little kid with the thick glasses who, by all rights, can't really perform at the same calibre as the other kids, who's marginalized most of the summer until his big brother steps up the plate, demands that the kid get something worthwhile, and the kid hits it out of the park.  And then there's the drunk, washed-up has-been screenwriter who finds his latest work pilfered and performed by Vlad so that he suddenly has a change of heart and renewed career prospects.All in all, the plot line was weak.  But the song and dance numbers were excellent, and there's definitely some raw vocal talent in this ensemble.  I wouldn't say not to rent it, but don't expect a cinematic masterpiece, or even a touching, tender film.

O'Neill ""Brunt, FCC""","[1, 2]","Written and directed by actor Todd Graff (most people will remember him as the rat toting rig worker in James Cameron's The Abyss), Camp is a delightful light gem of a film. It's Fame: The Next Generation, but it works because the cast is actually very talented. The late Jason Raize (who recently took his own life at the age of 28 in February 2004) -older Simba in the Broadway production of The Lion King -once said of that the role was a triple threat, for you had to beable to sing, dance and act. Here in this film, the cast has to do the same. Daniel Letterle shines as Vlad, the lone straight boy in Camp Ovation (handsome and talented, as he can sing). He's more than a pretty face, even though in reality, he was hired because he is handsome and has a body to die for. Shasha Allen as Dee and Tiffany Taylor as Joanna are brilliant finds, with voices of angels. Their preformances with chill you. Robin DeJesus displays a rare talent as a proud gay teen Michael who's only real dream is acceptence from his parents. The story is a bit cliched -even feeling at times like an old episode of Fame - and I wished almost that this could become a TV series as there are many story potentials. Things that disracted me was Don Dixon's Bert, a man who finds it difficult living in his own shadow and the Bud Miller sports director character that vanishes for no reason what so ever. I liked the film for many reasons, but mostlt for protraying gay teens in a very positive light. Even Vlad, while trying to understand Michael, seems to accept him with no issues. But over all, a fine debut for Graff and some star making performances from Allen and Taylor.",4,Camp is great fun...,1079740800,"03 20, 2004",2004,1658,"['Written', 'directed', 'actor', 'Todd', 'Graff', 'most', 'people', 'will', 'remember', 'rat', 'toting', 'rig', 'worker', 'James', 'Cameron', 'Abyss', 'Camp', 'delightful', 'light', 'gem', 'film', 'Fame', 'Next', 'Generation', 'cast', 'actually', 'very', 'talented', 'late', 'Jason', 'Raize', 'who', 'recently', 'took', 'own', 'life', 'age', '28', 'February', '2004', '-older', 'Simba', 'Broadway', 'production', 'Lion', 'King', '-once', 'said', 'role', 'was', 'triple', 'threat', 'had', 'beable', 'sing', 'dance', 'act', 'Here', 'film', 'cast', 'do', 'same', 'Daniel', 'Letterle', 'shines', 'Vlad', 'lone', 'straight', 'boy', 'Camp', 'Ovation', 'handsome', 'talented', 'can', 'sing', 'more', 'pretty', 'face', 'even', 'reality', 'was', 'hired', 'handsome', 'body', 'die', 'Shasha', 'Allen', 'Dee', 'Tiffany', 'Taylor', 'Joanna', 'are', 'brilliant', 'finds', 'voices', 'angels', 'preformances', 'chill', 'Robin', 'DeJesus', 'rare', 'talent', 'proud', 'gay', 'teen', 'Michael', 'who', 'only', 'real', 'dream', 'acceptence', 'parents', 'story', 'bit', 'cliched', '-even', 'feeling', 'times', 'old', 'episode', 'Fame', 'wished', 'almost', 'could', 'become', 'TV', 'series', 'are', 'many', 'story', 'potentials', 'Things', 'disracted', 'was', 'Don', 'Dixon', 'Bert', 'man', 'who', 'difficult', 'living', 'own', 'shadow', 'Bud', 'Miller', 'sports', 'director', 'character', 'reason', 'what', 'so', 'ever', 'liked', 'film', 'many', 'reasons', 'mostlt', 'protraying', 'gay', 'teens', 'very', 'positive', 'light', 'Even', 'Vlad', 'trying', 'understand', 'Michael', 'accept', 'issues', 'fine', 'debut', 'Graff', 'star', 'making', 'performances', 'Allen', 'Taylor']",Camp

787476,A33TRNCQK4IUO7,B0000VV4MW,guillermoj,"[3, 4]","I've always been a sucker for movies that take place during the summer season. It probably has to do with the romanticized notion that anything is possible during this limited seasonal window and that many of the stories told have to do with characters coming of age in one way or another. Some of my favorite ""summer"" movies include well-known crowd pleasers like ""The Flamingo Kid"" and ""Dirty Dancing,""  little seen gems like ""The Man In The Moon,"" and guilty pleasures like ""Summer Lovers"" and ""Little Darlings."" While I did not see ""Camp"" when it first came out, it received generally good buzz so when the DVD came out I decided to give it a shot.While by no means a perfect movie, ""Camp"" is hard to resist. Its strengths lie in a certain earnestness that is missing from most movies involving teens. As fun as movies like ""Heathers"" can be, there is a certainly a place for movies that may not be as dark or witty as the aforementioned but go in a different direction. Although I hate to give too much away in most of my reviews, it's not too much to say that the movie takes place in a musical camp that attracts kids who don't quite fit in with whatever ""normal"" is. I don't know if it was due to its marketing campaign or the movie's title, but many seemed to expecting this movie to be a send up of sorts of life at an unusual camp. So if you are looking for something ""campy,"" this is not that movie.The Good:The casting people chose to go with unknown singers over ""actors"" and it pays off beautifully as the movie has some killer songs performed with passion and it makes a strong case for following your bliss, no matter how geeky it may seem to others;There are many funny moments that are well-earned and there are not too many cheap shots at the expense of the characters;It tackles sexual, aesthetic, racial differences and phobias in a way that is not too heavy-handed;The best thing that this movie has going for it is spirit. In spite of many wrong turns, the director has established a ""plucky"" ambiance in which you are rooting for most of these kids no matter what.The extras: There is a ""making of"" segment that to me shows that this movie could have been an even better experience had it been made as a documentary. The writer/director attended the school that serves as the backdrop for the story, and he possesses an energy and likeability that may be stronger than anything captured in the film.The Bad:The script is weak and has structural challenges. We are introduced to many characters yet the film focuses on a charismatic character who, while vital to the story, acts in ways that make little sense because they are story-driven rather than character-driven. The script also fails to empower or even follow some of the kids that we are introduced to so only through song or dance do we get a minor glimpse into something that feels real;There are some heavy handed storylines, one involving a teacher and alcohol, and the other involving sexual orientation that don't belong in this movie. Also, while the movie has a running joke/truism about there not being any straight guys at acting camp, it fails to depict gays as anything other than guys who want to dress like women. Even a throwaway line saying that such is the case would have made a difference, as both the questions and expositions focus on why a guy would want to dress like a girl and never on the real issue for most. Shows like ""My So Called Life"" have tackled both of these issues in a funnier and more realistic manner;Although it's an ensemble piece, the story does not really allow the characters to gel collectively to show one of the reasons as to why these kids are drawn to the camp. There is a mean-spirited exchange that puts down a talented albeit overweight character, yet the writer director fails to even show her again or possibly show that she's no freakier than anyone else at camp;There is a deleted scene involving a softball game in the DVD extras that shows the root of where this movie fails to deliver. While it is very strong in introducing us to characters and showing them performing with all of their might, the writer/director seems to want to tackle several ""serious"" issues, and those scenes just don't fit into the story and take away what is working. The movie would have been much better had it focused on what it feels like to be at camp and the little/big things that can happen between the performances it chronicles.In a nutshell, I think that is this a movie that has enough merits to recommend it. Many of the musical performances in and of themselves are worth seeing it and would serve to remind some of how truly awful those kids from ""American Idol"" are. Nothing against those chosen for said show, but it seems to me that the decision makers are not looking in the right places. But I digress....In a time when most movies involve things exploding and people being killed, it's nice to see a little movie that reminds us that there was a time when we had a full season to think and play without worrying about grades, jobs, interest rates and an increasingly unsafe world. This movie easily earns 3 stars if you keep expectations light.",3,Great singing saves this movie from a poorly written story,1085616000,"05 27, 2004",2004,5182,"[""'ve"", 'always', 'been', 'sucker',

If you find that scene, then the entire movie works for you. Such is true about the wonderfully charming movie, &quot;Camp&quot;.The scene for this movie is early on, in the school bus that's transporting the various drama wannabees to Camp Ovation for the summer. The kdis are singing a dramatic, compelling showstopper song as we pan down the center aisle of the bus. The camera stops on a young blond boy singing his heart out, sitting next to a man, who turns to the boy and says, &quot;Bud Miller: Sports Counselor&quot;. The boy looks at the man incredulously and says, &quot;We have a SPORTS COUNSELOR?&quot;.Thus, this movie is made. Camp is a deliriously delightful romp with a bunch of multi-talents kids all spending their summer learning about the craft of acting, and the craft of life. Expected to perform a new show every two weeks, with a benefit at the end of the season seems ludicrous, but the kids pull it off, with great success.This film has many hearts to it, mainly in the characters of Ellen, Vlad, and Michael. As they interact with each other, each character avoids the strereotypical traps many teenager films fall into, and lets these characters live and breathe. There's not a candy coated kids in this film, and thanks to an excellent script, and equally excellent acting from the kids, it all becomes believable.The music is an intergral part to this movie, and somehow both propels the plot and supports it. I bought the CD the day after seeing the movie, and it still hasn't left my small collection of CDs I carry with me. I near tire of hearing some of the wonderful songs from the movie, including &quot;Century Plant&quot; and &quot;How Shall I See You Through My Tears&quot;.My boyfriend regularly puts me in his book reviews, so now I'll do the same. We both saw this movie together, twice, in a small theater just off Dupont Circle in Washington DC. I now cannot watch this impressive film without thinking of him.

787480,A8QYINCRYLLG9,B0000VV4MW,Josh Aterovis,"[4, 5]","When a movie has names like Oscar-winning composer Michael Gore (Fame), Tony Award-winning lyricist Lynn Ahrens (Ragtime), Choreographer Jerry Mitchell (Hairspray), Musical supervisor Tim Weil (Rent), and the granddaddy of them all, &Uuml;ber-producer Steven Sondheim associated with it-well, you know it must be something special. All these ""big names"" of the musical world practically donated their time and talent to writer/director Todd Graff's labor of love, Camp. The results turn out to be a modern, gayer version of ""Fame"". (Yes, apparently, Fame could get gayer.)The story follows the campers as they spend their summer at Camp Ovation, a performing arts camp based on Graff's real-life childhood experiences at just such a camp. There's plenty of drama (and not just on the stage), and the kids are learning more about themselves than performing. Michael, who is openly gay and the recent victim of a gay-bashing, is struggling with his family's rejection and self-image. Ellen has such low-self esteem that she begs her brother to take her to prom. Dee is terrified of being a fag-hag for the rest of her life. Fritz is so obsessed with being friends with Jill (the popular girl) that she is losing her own identity. Even the seemingly perfect Vlad, the boy no one can believe is really straight, has his own demons to fight.The story and writing is strong, the characterizations are even stronger. Each of the kids at the heart of the story is amazingly well-developed. I would have loved to have seen more development with some of the secondary characters, but you can only do so much in 114 minutes. The most impressive part of the whole movie is the kids themselves though. They're not all the best actors in the world, although they all portray their characters quite convincingly. Not a single one of them had ever been in a movie before Camp. What's so impressive is their musical talent. These kids have pipes! I'm sure we haven't seen the last of this cast.One of the ways I judge a movie is how it affects me emotionally. Camp hit me hard on several levels. I found myself laughing out loud quite often. (My favorite line is when Spitzer turns to Jill after a particularly bitchy moment and says, ""I think I know your step-sister. Cinderella?"") I was moved to tears almost as often.

787483,A30TK6U7DNS82R,B0000VV4MW,Kevin Killian,"[3, 4]","CAMP is a curious mixture of the good and the bad.  And when I say bad I mean thunderously awful.  The editing of some of the scenes, and the transitions between one scene and the next, are God awful.  We saw CAMP over the last few days and I'm still puzzled by some of the director's decisions.  I remember seeing his previous movie IN THE BEDROOM with Sissy Spacek and thinking wow, this is pretentious, and I'm glad to see he lightened up a bit with CAMP.  How serious could you be with that title anyhow?  The strange ""camp"" aspect of the movie was the plot in which little Fritzie, with her little eyes and bush of brown hair like the girl in WELCOME TO THE DOLLHOUSE, tries making herself invaluable to the popular Britney type girl Jill.  Fritzie's pretty creepy and after awhile, I started feeling sorry for Jill, even though she's unpleasant and unbelievably cruel, self centered, and sort of a big girl.  Plus, Jill proved herself talented enough to shine in the Bacharach-David number IT'S TURKEY LURKEY TIME, if I remember right the song that made Donna McKechnie a star.By the way it does make you wonder why PROMISES, PROMISES had never been made into a movie!  I can't be the only PROMISES fan whose appetite is even more whetted than before after seeing the big office Christmas party scene on film.Most of all, CAMP is great when Daniel Letterle is on the screen.  I didn't want to like him, but I wound up in awe of his talent, his stomach, his acting, even the way that he must be kind of short in real life but in CAMP he walks tall.  You can see why all the boys and girls at Camp Ovation love Vlad, even though (as his name suggests) he's rather an emotional vampire.  When he and the CAMP gang launch into Victoria Williams' CENTURY PLANT, it's corny all right, but thrilling at the same time, like when Tony struggles up out of his wheelchair to join Neely at the asylum rec room when she sings his great hit, ""Come Live With Me,"" in VALLEY OF THE DOLLS.  CAMP isn't a great movie by any means, and in many ways a retread of FAME, but it has a heart and nowadays that's saying quite a bit.  And it has a star, some great voices, some cute songs and kids singing ""Losing My Mind.""",4,Stardust,1132876800,"11 25, 2005",2005,2203,"['CAMP', 'curious', 'mixture', 'good', 'bad', 'when', 'say', 'bad', 'mean', 'thunderously', 'awful', 'editing', 'scenes', 'transitions', 'one', 'scene', 'next', 'are', 'God', 'awful', 'saw', 'CAMP', 'last', 'few', 'days', ""'m"", 'still', 'puzzled', 'director', 'decisions', 'remember', 'seeing', 'previous', 'movie', 'IN', 'THE', 'BEDROOM', 'Sissy', 'Spacek', 'thinking', 'wow', 'pretentious', ""'m"", 'glad', 'see', 'lightened', 'up', 'bit', 'CAMP', 'How', 'serious', 'could', 'be', 'title', 'anyhow', 'strange', 'camp', 'aspect', 'movie', 'was', 'plot', 'little', 'Fritzie', 'little', 'eyes', 'bush', 'brown', 'hair', 'girl', 'WELCOME', 'TO', 'THE', 'DOLLHOUSE', 'making', 'invaluable', 'popular', 'Britney', 'type', 'girl', 'Jill', 'Fritzie', 'pretty', 'creepy', 'awhile', 'started', 'feeling', 'sorry', 'Jill', 'even', 'unpleasant', 'unbelievably', 'cruel', 'self', 'centered', 'sort', 'big', 'girl', 'Jill', 'proved', 'talented', 'enough', 'shine', 'Bacharach-David', 'number', 'IT', 'TURKEY', 'LURKEY', 'TIME', 'remember', 'right', 'song', 'made', 'Donna', 'McKechnie', 'star.By', 'way', 'make', 'wonder', 'why', 'PROMISES', 'PROMISES', 'had', 'never', 'been', 'made', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'only', 'PROMISES', 'fan', 'appetite', 'even', 'more', 'whetted', 'before', 'seeing', 'big', 'office', 'Christmas', 'party', 'scene', 'film.Most', 'CAMP', 'great', 'when', 'Daniel', 'Letterle', 'screen', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'like', 'wound', 'up', 'awe', 'talent', 'stomach', 'acting', 'even', 'way', 'must', 'be', 'kind', 'short', 'real', 'life', 'CAMP', 'tall', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'boys', 'girls', 'Camp', 'Ovation', 'love', 'Vlad', 'even', 'though', 'name', 'rather', 'emotional', 'vampire', 'When', 'CAMP', 'gang', 'launch', 'Victoria', 'Williams', 'CENTURY', 'PLANT', 'corny', 'all', 'right', 'thrilling', 'same', 'time', 'when', 'Tony', 'up', 'wheelchair', 'join', 'Neely', 'asylum', 'rec', 'room', 'when', 'sings', 'great', 'hit', 'Come', 'Live', 'Me', 'VALLEY', 'THE', 'DOLLS', 'CAMP', ""n't"", 'great', 'movie', 'means', 'many', 'ways', 'retread', 'FAME', 'heart', 'saying', 'quite', 'bit', 'star', 'great', 'voices', 'cute', 'songs', 'kids', 'singing', 'Losing', 'Mind']",Camp

787486,A1DZKOOMMJM1MI,B0000VV4MW,"Mark Twain ""Sam""","[36, 42]","It's movies like &#65533;Camp&#65533; that remind me what I love most about movies. It doesn&#65533;t preach an agenda and doesn&#65533;t make me feel like a fool for feeling sentimental. It has a little bit of cynicism but a lot of great music. There are no drugs, no guns, no car chases and no fake breasts. What &#65533;Camp&#65533; does, and does very well, is tell a story. Simply and completely. &#65533;Camp&#65533; took me into a world I was both familiar and stranger to, and made me feel better for taking the journey. While there will be little chance the film will find the same kind of mainstream hit &#65533;Chicago&#65533; or &#65533;Moulin Rouge&#65533; became, &#65533;Camp&#65533; should become a favorite with discerning movie musical fans and help re-usher in this dormant too long genre.While summer camp often means nature trips, cookouts and wacky hijinks to most young people, Camp Ovation in upstate New York caters to those who are more artistically inclined. Over the two months campers attend, they will put on a new show every other week, be it drama, musical or something more avant-garde, going through the process of auditioning, creating their own sets and costumes, rehearsing and presenting a new show for an audience, then beginning anew the next day. Many of the kids at Camp Ovation are outsiders within their own worlds. Ellen (Joanna Chilcoat) is reduced to begging her older brother in order to have a date to her junior prom, while Michael (Robin DeJesus) gets beaten up at his prom for daring to arrive in drag. Fritzi (Anna Kendrick) is so starved for any attention, she spends her entire year waiting for camp so she can be the &#65533;assistant&#65533; to Ovation&#65533;s number one drama diva, Jill (Alana Allen). Our first clue things will be different this summer arrives in the form of Vlad (Daniel Letterle). He&#65533;s cute, talented and seemingly the only straight male in the entire teenage camp populace. Ellen, Michael and Jill will all fall for Vlad, even if he has no idea who Stephen Sondheim is. Each year, Camp Ovation has one artist in residence to help run the shows and inspire the nascent talent. This year&#65533;s guest director is Bert Hanley (Don Dixon), a once promising writer who had been the toast of Broadway with his first musical, but never delivered a follow-up show. The story follows these kids as they deal with each other over the course of the summer. Hearts are broken, lifelong friendships are created, and there&#65533;s that one ambitious actress who makes Eve Harrington look undemonstrative.From the opening credits, in which the company performs the rousing, gospel-esque &#65533;How Shall I See You Through My Tears&#65533; to the end, when they dance through their own rendition of &#65533;The Want of a Nail,&#65533; it is this group of talented youngsters who make the movie come alive. For while most of the cast are cinema neophytes, they have a warmth and energy which make them feel familiar and comfortable. The film feels almost like a documentary, for what little over-acting does appear is saved for the sequences of the stage performances. And it is these stage performances that are the best part of ""Camp."" These kids are simply amazing, their voices powerful and seductive!Residing somewhere between &#65533;Meatballs&#65533; and &#65533;Fame,&#65533; &#65533;Camp&#65533; is the brainchild of actor turned writer Todd Graff, who based the story on his own experiences at the Stagedoor Manor camp (where the film was shot) as a youngster in the 1970s, where he was a camper and later a counselor during his teen years.Making his directorial debut here, Graff has assembled a first rate team around him, ensuring the film&#65533;s success as a work of art.

And yet, it has an undeniable charm that makes it absolutely irresistible, even as it is very clumsy in execution.I was very excited about this film because I am a huge fan of musical theater, particularly Sondheim (who makes a cameo in the film!).  In terms of the musical performances, I was extremely impressed--all of them are good and some of them are truly stunning.  My major disappointment is that nothing was included from Follies, which would have been absolutely fabulous.It is the energy of the performers that makes this movie.  The acting, particularly by Letterle, is pretty commonplace.  The script is OK, but predictable.  There are some touching scenes though, particularly those involving the perpetually hung-over composer.  The other character that steals the show is that short blond boy with the spiked hair who has this infectious smile (and, of course, the line &quot;We have a SPORTS COUNSELOR?!?&quot;) But, basically, there's very little outside the musical numbers to rave about.But what spectacular musical numbers they are!  Watching &quot;The Ladies Who Lunch&quot; (particularly Kendrick) is spectacularly entertaining.  And at its sentimental best, the movie cranks out &quot;Here's Where I Stand&quot;, boasting yet another great performance by a young performer.  This emotion is almost achieved during &quot;Century Plant,&quot; but Letterle's bland acting half-ruins the emotion of the song.Clearly, the director/writer has true empathy for these misfit characters at Camp Ovation.  By the end of this film, I'm not sure what the director was trying to say, or if there was any particular message.  But I do know that, having viewed this movie, I, just like the director, love these misfit kids, who will leave Camp Ovation to return to &quot;normal&quot; society where it is Eminem, not Stephen Sondheim, who reigns over the music world.

But for those who remember adolescence, everything is angsty and melodramatic - it's a time of operatic emotions and overblown reactions. It's a time when you think that no one has ever loved as you have, when tripping over your feet in the lunchroom is an embarrassment that surpasses that being arrested for prostitution, and a single zit on your forehead makes you want to take to bed for a week.In Camp, Todd Graff captures those emotions perfectly. The actor are up to the task, with Robin de Jesus giving an Oscar-worthy performance as the drag-loving Michael. I'm serious. Compare his gutsy, accomplished performance with the tentative underacting of Jaye Davidson in The Crying Game, and I think you'll agree that it was de Jesus who should have walking the red carpet with his acceptance speech folded in the pocket of his tuxedo - or his evening gown.But all the kids are terrific performers.

You rarely see the performance of an entire song.  Even when you get more than a few lines, other visuals are interspersed.  I guess the realization is that most of the songs are so boring and unmemorable that more than a few lines of them is going to make the viewer lose attention.And, this leads to another problem with the movie which is that, even though it's a musical, the musical numbers are just OK.  Nothing sticks out.  I can't remember the tune or words of a single one.I do think the acting was adequate, and some of the kids are excellent singers and good performers.  But, it's hard to act when the writing is so weak.  The characters are given a jumble of character traits that just don't exist in any one person, their motivation is impossible to divine, and when the plot requires it they have an instant change to someone else.  Michael for example:  what is he ""confused"" about?  Is he questioning whether he is gay?  Is he a transexual?  Is he a transvestite?  Did he dress as a woman for his prom because he was making a statement about being gay?  Transgendered?  It doesn't make sense the way it was present.  And Vlad, how can he be so genuinely concerned about the needs of others, an extreme narcisssist and suffer from OCD at the same time?  Is he some kind of psychiatric miracle?  There are other characters as well whose motivations and shifts are very jarring.I watched it all the way through because the musical numbers, and the overall feel of the piece was enjoyable enough.  Overall, it was just OK.",3,If you can suspend disbelief - a lot,1117929600,"06 5, 2005",2005,2000,"['really', 'have', 'approach', 'movie', 'frivolous', 'musical', 'where', 'plot', 'excuse', 'hang', 'bunch', 'musical', 'numbers.This', 'one', 'teen', 'movie', 'stories', 'where', 'adults', 'do', ""n't"", 'exist', 'very', 'much', 'extent', 'do', 'are', 'useless', 'idiots', 'skulking', 'background', 'One', 'adult', 'prominently', 'featured', 'need', 'teens', 'teach', 'how', 'live', 'Yawn.Unfortunately', 'movie', 'also', 'follow', 'annoying', 'trend', 'recent', 'musicals', 'rarely', 'see', 'performance', 'entire', 'song', 'Even', 'when', 'get', 'more', 'few', 'lines', 'other', 'visuals', 'are', 'interspersed', 'guess', 'realization', 'most', 'songs', 'are', 'so', 'boring', 'unmemorable', 'more', 'few', 'lines', 'going', 'make', 'viewer', 'lose', 'attention.And', 'problem', 'movie', 'even', 'musical', 'musical', 'numbers', 'are', 'just', 'OK', 'Nothing', 'out', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'tune', 'words', 'single', 'one.I', 'do', 'think', 'acting', 'was', 'adequate', 'kids', 'are', 'excellent', 'singers', 'good', 'performers', 'hard', 'act', 'when', 'writing', 'so', 'weak', 'characters', 'are', 'given', 'jumble', 'character', 'traits', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'exist', 'one', 'person', 'motivation', 'impossible', 'divine', 'when', 'plot', 'have', 'instant', 'change', 'someone', 'else', 'Michael', 'example', 'what', 'confused', 'questioning', 'gay', 'transexual', 'transvestite', 'Did', 'dress', 'woman', 'prom', 'was', 'making', 'statement', 'being', 'gay', 'Transgendered', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'way', 'was', 'present', 'Vlad', 'how', 'can', 'be', 'so', 'genuinely', 'concerned', 'needs', 'others', 'extreme', 'narcisssist', 'suffer', 'OCD', 'same', 'time', 'kind', 'psychiatric', 'miracle', 'are', 'other', 'characters', 'well', 'motivations', 'shifts', 'are', 'very', 'jarring.I', 'watched', 'way', 'musical', 'numbers', 'overall', 'feel', 'piece', 'was', 'enjoyable', 'enough', 'Overall', 'was', 'just', 'OK']",Camp
