Yeah, you have to mill through two tons of dirt to find one itty-bitty gem, but half the fun is the search, right?I gave this film a chance finding it on a compilation disc, and having seen (and being greatly disappointed in) ""The Legend of Bloody Mary"", I was curious to what kind of view another group of filmmakers might have.Well, here's to more dirt:(Whereas the acting in this movie wasn't AWFUL, it left a lot to be desired, but I could live with that.  As another reviewer pointed out, I was put off by the lackadaisical portrayal of the mental hospital policies, or perhaps I should say the LACK of them...but I could live with THAT.  There was both male and female nudity, both of which lingered longer than was really necessary for the advancement of the plot, but I could live with THAT. The plot wasn't terribly original, but it DID have ambition, and under different circumstances could quite likely have had potential.However...What killed this film for me, without giving it all away, are the gaping holes in the story that the filmmakers either simply forgot about, thought they did a good enough job of leaving clues for the viewer to deduce the answers (they did NOT), or simply thought it would be clever to have the ambiance of a lot of ""unknowns"".None of the above were acceptable in my opinion.Spoiler free, I'll just say there are three GLARING plot points that absolutely no explanation or revelations are given for.  It's as though we're supposed to already know what's going on...whereas I suppose the argument can be made that it gives the movie 'mystique', in this instance it simply leaves you wondering what the hell you've just watched.Oh, and the scene where you hear the gun fire but there's no flash, no smoke, no slide, and no spent shell casings...what, blanks were too expensive?I wouldn't bother with this one, fans.  Maybe someday, someone will give us an intelligent and scary Bloody Mary film, but for now, we wait.",2,What exactly just happened??,1285804800,"09 30, 2010",2010,1990,"[""'m"", 'huge', 'fan', 'indie', 'horror', 'Yeah', 'have', 'mill', 'two', 'tons', 'dirt', 'find', 'one', 'itty-bitty', 'gem', 'fun', 'search', 'right', 'gave', 'film', 'chance', 'finding', 'compilation', 'disc', 'having', 'seen', 'being', 'greatly', 'disappointed', 'Legend', 'Bloody', 'Mary', 'was', 'curious', 'what', 'kind', 'view', 'group', 'filmmakers', 'might', 'have.Well', 'here', 'more', 'dirt', 'acting', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'AWFUL', 'left', 'lot', 'be', 'desired', 'could', 'live', 'reviewer', 'pointed', 'out', 'was', 'put', 'off', 'lackadaisical', 'portrayal', 'mental', 'hospital', 'policies', 'perhaps', 'should', 'say', 'LACK', 'could', 'live', 'was', 'male', 'female', 'nudity', 'lingered', 'longer', 'was', 'really', 'necessary', 'advancement', 'plot', 'could', 'live', 'plot', 'was', ""n't"", 'terribly', 'original', 'DID', 'have', 'ambition', 'different', 'circumstances', 'could', 'quite', 'likely', 'have', 'had', 'potential.However', 'What', 'killed', 'film', 'giving', 'away', 'are', 'gaping', 'holes', 'story', 'filmmakers', 'simply', 'forgot', 'thought', 'did', 'good', 'enough', 'job', 'leaving', 'clues', 'viewer', 'deduce', 'answers', 'did', 'NOT', 'simply', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'clever', 'have', 'ambiance', 'lot', 'unknowns', '.None', 'above', 'were', 'acceptable', 'opinion.Spoiler', 'free', ""'ll"", 'just', 'say', 'are', 'three', 'GLARING', 'plot', 'points', 'absolutely', 'explanation', 'revelations', 'are', 'given', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'already', 'know', 'what', 'going', 'whereas', 'suppose', 'argument', 'can', 'be', 'made', 'movie', ""'mystique"", 'instance', 'simply', 'wondering', 'what', 'hell', ""'ve"", 'just', 'watched.Oh', 'scene', 'where', 'hear', 'gun', 'fire', 'flash', 'smoke', 'slide', 'spent', 'shell', 'casings', 'what', 'blanks', 'were', 'too', 'expensive', 'would', ""n't"", 'bother', 'one', 'fans', 'Maybe', 'someday', 'someone', 'will', 'give', 'intelligent', 'scary', 'Bloody', 'Mary', 'film', 'now', 'wait']",Bloody Mary

This movie tries to be cute by making the plot difficult to follow, but the problem is that the story sucks, and the plot has gaping holes in it and the movie never makes any sense.  Some movies are difficult to follow leaving the viewer to make some conclusions on his own like Dario Argento's great ""Suspiria"", but this movie just does not make any sense.  The acting in this movie is atrocious, the movie doesn't flow well, the script is terrible and there is no atmosphere whatsoever.

1035697,A3PWPNZVMNX3PA,B000KWZ1S4,rareoopdvds,"[5, 11]","I read the reviews here and was intrigued by this film, so I gave it a chance. With minimal budget, I think the film was really well done. Some of the scripting and acting is amateurish, but it at least remains consistent. I might be knit-picking a bit here, but the part that really irked me the most were the scenes in the mental hospital. Mostly the doctors, who obviously have never worked in a hospital, or know any of the rules that govern such an institute. First, the main character, Natalie (Kim Tyler) is able to walk on the property and visit patients who have no relationship to her. This is definately against policy in that they need consent from the patient. Next she brings in a gift (a teddy bear) which is also not allowed to give gifts unless inspected and approved by the hospital. She ends up giving it to some other patient. Natalie would probably not be allowed back to that hospital because of that. Most of the patients are typical ""crazies"" who are free to walk around, which would not be the case either. Not to mention they walk freely around Natalie with no observation from the mental health workers. The conversation with the two head doctors and Natalie would never have happened, and even if it did, they would not have had that conversation revealing so much about a patient. Although the head doctor mentions ""patient confidentiality"", he continues at length discussing the patient who has no relevance to Natalie's life (save for her detective work, but thats only for the stories sake). He also says they dont know whats wrong with her and it would be too early to make any kind of diagnosis. This is what really threw me. If they had no diagnosis, the patient would not be in the hospital. With health care insurance knee deep in hospital policy, a diagnosis is mandated before any insurance can be given, thus any treatment. So, in sum, the hospital setting is that of a pre-war era with some knowledge of the modern hospital routine, so it comes off as ignorant.Otherwise the film, as a horror movie does its job with some decent scares, good gore, lots of attractive girls running around, nude at times, which makes for a relatively solid horror film.",3,Overall a decent horror film,1176854400,"04 18, 2007",2007,2192,"['read', 'reviews', 'here', 'was', 'intrigued', 'film', 'gave', 'chance', 'minimal', 'budget', 'think', 'film', 'was', 'really', 'well', 'done', 'scripting', 'acting', 'amateurish', 'least', 'remains', 'consistent', 'might', 'be', 'knit-picking', 'bit', 'here', 'part', 'really', 'irked', 'most', 'were', 'scenes', 'mental', 'hospital', 'Mostly', 'doctors', 'who', 'obviously', 'have', 'never', 'worked', 'hospital', 'know', 'rules', 'govern', 'institute', 'First', 'main', 'character', 'Natalie', 'Kim', 'Tyler', 'able', 'walk', 'property', 'visit', 'patients', 'who', 'have', 'relationship', 'definately', 'policy', 'need', 'consent', 'patient', 'Next', 'gift', 'teddy', 'bear', 'also', 'not', 'allowed', 'give', 'gifts', 'inspected', 'approved', 'hospital', 'up', 'giving', 'other', 'patient', 'Natalie', 'would', 'probably', 'not', 'be', 'allowed', 'back', 'hospital', 'Most', 'patients', 'are', 'typical', 'crazies', 'who', 'are', 'free', 'walk', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'case', 'Not', 'mention', 'walk', 'freely', 'Natalie', 'observation', 'mental', 'health', 'workers', 'conversation', 'two', 'head', 'doctors', 'Natalie', 'would', 'never', 'have', 'happened', 'even', 'did', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'had', 'conversation', 'revealing', 'so', 'much', 'patient', 'head', 'doctor', 'mentions', 'patient', 'confidentiality', 'length', 'discussing', 'patient', 'who', 'relevance', 'Natalie', 'life', 'save', 'detective', 'work', 'only', 'stories', 'sake', 'also', 'dont', 'know', 'whats', 'wrong', 'would', 'be', 'too', 'early', 'make', 'kind', 'diagnosis', 'what', 'really', 'threw', 'had', 'diagnosis', 'patient', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'hospital', 'health', 'care', 'insurance', 'knee', 'deep', 'hospital', 'policy', 'diagnosis', 'mandated', 'insurance', 'can', 'be', 'given', 'thus', 'treatment', 'So', 'sum', 'hospital', 'setting', 'pre-war', 'era', 'knowledge', 'modern', 'hospital', 'routine', 'off', 'ignorant.Otherwise', 'film', 'horror', 'movie', 'job', 'decent', 'scares', 'good', 'gore', 'lots', 'attractive', 'girls', 'running', 'around', 'nude', 'times', 'relatively', 'solid', 'horror', 'film']",Bloody Mary
