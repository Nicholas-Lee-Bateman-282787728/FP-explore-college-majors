I only wished that they had teamed up for more than just Fire and Ice.  The additional Disc with the Frazetta story adds a new insight to an artist that I have admired for a long time.  Ralph Bakshi has made movies in his own unique style.  The two together make a good team.The storyline progresses rapidly from the action packed start till the very end.

918938,A1GQ7AFCN7OZMK,B000A2LV4W,amster,"[8, 9]","After over twenty years I finally got to see this movie.  When it came out, it got terrible reviews, and only stayed in theatres for a couple of weeks before being pulled.  Although I initially wanted to see it, I assumed that it did so poorly because it sucked, and I quickly forgot all about it.  Well, all I can say is that I wished that I had took the time to go see it then, because this is by far my favorite Bakshi film.I won't go into the plot, because 1) other reviewers already have and will, and 2) I hate spoilers.  It basically has the ""Star Wars/Pirates of the Caribbean"" trio of main characters; the gallant but slightly green youth, the jaded rogue with the heart of gold, and the damsal in distress who can hold her own. There's nothing extraordianary or original about it.  Its basically a hero's journey/revenge/boy meets girl story.But if you're a fan of Frank Frazetta, you have to see this movie.  Many of his most famous images are brought to life.  The princess is right out of the paintings of Dejah Thoris/Cat Girl/Egyptian Queen.  For a cartoon, she's extremely hot and ridiculously curvy.  She also wears an ""A cup"" bra over a pair of double Ds (very Frazetta!).  The hero is obviously modeled after the guy who fought the giant snake on the cover of the old paperback ""Wolfshead"".  The evil queen is right out of the painting ""Sea Witch"", and the thugs are Franzetta's neanderthals.  The bad guy Necron looks like Elric of Melnibone, although I don't recall Frazetta ever painting that character.  Strange.The audio and video quality is extremely good.  The plot moves at a brisk pace, and the action scenes are exciting and extremely well choriographed.  The rotoscoping is much improved over Bakshi's ""Lord of the Rings"", which looked cheesy and ""fake"" to me in some of the scenes.I'm glad I finally got to see this movie, and in my opinion it is worthy of future viewings.  Let's face it, if you like Sword and Sorcery films, there are very few quality titles out there.  Hopefully, with the success of ""Lord of the Rings"", and the advent of CGI, this will be rectified in the future.  In the meantime, its good that titles such as this are finally available.

The plot, is pretty straightforward. For those familiar with Conan the Barbarian, this is something similar. Nekron, the Mage lord and Master of Ice Keep uses his powers to push his glacial kingdom southward in order to take over and destroy all who oppose him. He does have a problem. The only king to stand against him is Jerol, the Ruler of FireKeep. Nekron's plan is to subjugate FireKeep by kidnapping his daughter, Teegra. However,plans do go slightly awry as Teegra manages to escape and encounters Larn, a youth from a village destroyed by Nekron's ice. When they encounter a monstrous water beast Larn is injured and Teegra recaptured by Nekron's ""Dogs"" the subhuman people who serve him. Larn encounters DarkWolf,a mysterious warrior who also seeks revenge on Nekron and is helped by him. Teegra again escapes but is found by Roliel, a beautiful witch who lives in the forest.Roliel attempts to bargain with the Dog soldiers, but she and her son are killed and Teegra is taken at last to Ice Keep, where she is offered as a bride to Nekron. Spurned by Nekron, she is literally tossed aside where she discovers later to her horror, that her brother and his small entourage are dead and tossed in with her. Larn attempts to find Teegra but is captured and imprisoned by Nekron and it is Teegra who finds him and he manages to escape, but loses Teegra in the process. He and DarkWolf meet up and head to FireKeep to warn Jerol that Nekron is coming. Mounted on Dragonhawks, DarkWolf and Larn return to lead an attack on IceKeep and while Larn finally finds Teegrs, DarkWolf attacks Nekron to exact his own vengeance.Because the glacier is so close to FireKeep, Jerol releases the lava.Do Larn and DarkWolf escape? Does Teegra get back home? If you can find this movie, then you'll know. I still like animation before computers took over, and while CGI can be pretty impressive,old school hand drawn had its charms and rotoscoping was as close as one could get to real life, unless it was stop motion film work, because it took from real life. Stunt people did the action which was laboriously transferred to screen and what we see is taken from the work that everyone did.Bakshi was an innovator at a time when animated films were ""Family pictures"" only and Disney had a stranglehold on the G-rated realm.Films like ""Fritz the Cat"" ""Heavy Metal"" and ""Fire and Ice"" were not meant at all for children, and therefore had fewer constraints. Now, they might seem somewhat tame,but for many, these midnight movies, still hold the appeal they once did because they broke the mold and proved that animation could be more than just a place for the kiddies to go and play.

918943,A1STJE8KFRWK3S,B000A2LV4W,Brian Glass,"[6, 6]","I saw this for the first time in 1987.  I don't know how it escaped my attention when it first came out.  I was a huge Frazetta fan back then and this would be a dream come true.  I watched it over and over on a taped copy I made from Cinemax.  It was a bad tape but I loved it.  Now almost twenty years later it's not as great as I remember but it also hasn't aged as badly as I was expecting.  The thing that struck me most was the heavy lines on the characters.  The characters almost looked like a Hanna Barbara cartoon.  They reminded me of the Superfriends or Space Ghost.  There is an odd mix of poor quality drawings and some pretty compelling art.  The rotoscoping is a neat technique and it makes for some good action scenes.  And some of the background art is spectacular.The plot is paper thin but no worse then some live action films I've seen.  The voice acting reminded me a lot of the first Heavy Metal movie.Fire and Ice is an interesting movie if you're a fan of Frank Frazetta or into fantasy and animation.The thing that makes this DVD worth the purchase is the documentary ""Painting with Fire"" about Frank Frazetta.  When I was younger I had a few books of his works that I would memorize.  His art meant a lot to me and his life is fascinating.  I never realized how tough his early years were.  You just assume a giant talent like this was getting rich right off the bat.  It turns out he was struggling and some lucky breaks helped to launch his career.  He's been through a lot of adversity but bares it with an upbeat optimism.  After six strokes he had to learn to paint using his left hand.It means a lot when the comic greats like Bernie Wrightson, John Buscema, Dave Stevens, Neal Adams are gushing fanboys.  Everyone interviewed has nothing but good things to say about him.  He's apparently a good friend and great father.The inclusion of the documentary is a valuable bonus that makes the Fire and Ice DVD worth buying.",4,Odd Mix But Satisfying Enough,1137888000,"01 22, 2006",2006,1952,"['saw', 'first', 'time', '1987', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'escaped', 'attention', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'was', 'huge', 'Frazetta', 'fan', 'back', 'then', 'would', 'be', 'dream', 'come', 'true', 'watched', 'taped', 'copy', 'made', 'Cinemax', 'was', 'bad', 'tape', 'loved', 'Now', 'almost', 'twenty', 'years', 'later', 'not', 'as', 'great', 'remember', 'also', ""n't"", 'aged', 'as', 'badly', 'was', 'expecting', 'thing', 'struck', 'most', 'was', 'heavy', 'lines', 'characters', 'characters', 'almost', 'looked', 'Hanna', 'Barbara', 'cartoon', 'reminded', 'Superfriends', 'Space', 'Ghost', 'odd', 'mix', 'poor', 'quality', 'drawings', 'pretty', 'compelling', 'art', 'rotoscoping', 'neat', 'technique', 'good', 'action', 'scenes', 'background', 'art', 'spectacular.The', 'plot', 'paper', 'thin', 'worse', 'then', 'live', 'action', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'voice', 'acting', 'reminded', 'lot', 'first', 'Heavy', 'Metal', 'movie.Fire', 'Ice', 'interesting', 'movie', ""'re"", 'fan', 'Frank', 'Frazetta', 'fantasy', 'animation.The', 'thing', 'DVD', 'purchase', 'documentary', 'Painting', 'Fire', 'Frank', 'Frazetta', 'When', 'was', 'younger', 'had', 'few', 'books', 'works', 'would', 'memorize', 'art', 'meant', 'lot', 'life', 'fascinating', 'never', 'realized', 'how', 'tough', 'early', 'years', 'were', 'just', 'assume', 'giant', 'talent', 'was', 'getting', 'rich', 'right', 'bat', 'out', 'was', 'struggling', 'lucky', 'breaks', 'helped', 'launch', 'career', 'been', 'lot', 'adversity', 'upbeat', 'optimism', 'six', 'strokes', 'had', 'learn', 'paint', 'using', 'left', 'hand.It', 'lot', 'when', 'comic', 'greats', 'Bernie', 'Wrightson', 'John', 'Buscema', 'Dave', 'Stevens', 'Neal', 'Adams', 'are', 'gushing', 'fanboys', 'Everyone', 'interviewed', 'nothing', 'good', 'things', 'say', 'apparently', 'good', 'friend', 'great', 'father.The', 'inclusion', 'documentary', 'valuable', 'bonus', 'Fire', 'Ice', 'DVD', 'buying']",N/A

A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[9, 21]","There was a certain time in the 1980s when barbarian fantasy movies were the movie trend du jour, which is presumably how Ralph Bakshi and artist Frank Frazetta got the go-ahead for ""Fire and Ice."" It's basically a gauzy wisp of a plot that is filled with hilariously cheezy dialogue, semi-nude damsels and other fun things dredged from the imagination of a 13-year-old swords-and-sorcery geek.After the Ice Age, evil queen Julianna and her son Nekron (?!?!?!) decided to conquer the world with his giant telekinetically-controlled iceberg. The only place they haven't squished or conquered is Firekeep, so they kidnap King Jarol's almost-naked daughter Teegra -- but she escapes, and ends up encountering Larn, a strapping young barbarian whose village was wrecked by Nekron. They fight, she runs away, and two minutes later they're prepped for the horizontal mambo.But after a Random Monster Attack knocks Larn out, our inept hero wakes to find that Teegra has been taken by Juliana's subhuman minions. So he joins forces with a mysterious hooded man named Dark Wolf, who apparently is POed at Julianna for reasons never explored in-story, and wants to kill Nekron (again, for reasons never explored in-story). Together they plan to take back Teegra and save the world, blah blah blah.""Fire And Ice"" is is basically your run-of-the-mill barbarian fantasy story, so it doesn't have much of a plot beyond Save The Shapely Damsel And Defeat The Threat Against The World. Blatant sexism (""Waa, nobody takes me seriously, so I'll roll around in a string bikini!""), hinted racism, a designated Evil Gay Villain, and a seemingly endless list of plot holes (Teegra is unable to escape an OVERHAND KNOT?) and inconsistencies (why can subhumans scale a cliff but not a TREE?).And the whole thing is CHEESY. The dialogue is cheesy (""You may have caught me, but you'll never give me to Nekron!""), the monsters are cheesy (pirouetting kraken attack!), and the cheesiness of the climax could make enough grilled sandwiches to feed the entire world for a year. And it's pretty funny at times in its earnestness, with dialogue filled with unintentionally hilarious moments (""Give me your love,"" Teegra's dad says to his almost-naked daughter) and action scenes (two guys in speedos whacking each other with swords! Hello Freudian symbolism!).And the whole thing is done with mind-blowing seriousness. Well, except for a few scenes of sexual symbolism that just have to be tongue-in-cheek -- like Nekron writhing and screaming as his magically upthrusting pillars of ice explode in sprays of liquid. That can't possibly be serious.The reigning character here is Dark Wolf, a butt-kicking and level-headed guy who wears a cat-eared executioner's mask and STILL looks tough. He also sneezes more brain cells than our hero ever did -- despite being The Designated Hero, Larn never actually succeeds in anything he does. And Teegra is basically there to scamper around the woods in a child's string bikini and writhe around suggestively to get male attention, like a pornographic Snow White.""Fire and Ice"" runs neither hot nor cold -- it's just a vast oozing mass of cheese, with lots of naked women and vaguely offensive undertones.

Often his films tend to look cheap and the plots are kind of rambling. Not so with Fire and Ice. It's VERY straight forward and the art is amazing.Our journey begins with a guys face being contorted as if he's being sucked off. This is transposed with shots of a glacier that apears to be growing and changing. We soon discover that the guy is Nekron and he is a dark wizard that can control the ice. He destroys a village with it and there is only one survivor, Larn.The glacier moves on towards ""Firekeep"", with which the wizard is at war. He sends envoys to demand unconditional surrender and when the King refuses, they kidnap his daughter. And OH what a daughter! She's only just barely contained in her string bikini.She escapes her captors and meets up with Larn. Eventually we meet Darkwolf, a drifting barbarian with legendary fighting skill. This guy is essentially Conan.The art in this film is spectacular. The backdrops are very basic, but beautiful nonetheless. The action is great and there are plenty of new elements that keep popping up. At 80 minutes it's a bit brisk and I wanted it to go on for another three hours.It should be noted that the image is amazing. The bit rate stays in the high 8's and even breaches the high 9's, so it's superbly crisp and surprisingly clean. It's even got a DTS-ES mix so the sound is fantastic too.There are plenty of extras including footage of the original shoot with actors and the whole process of animation. The best is on disc 2. It's a 93 minute documentary on the life of Frank Frazzeta. If you don't know who that is, he's pretty much the modern equivelant of Michelangelo. he just so happens to work in genre pieces and they sell in the 1/4 of a million dollar range. He worked side by side with Bakshi on this film for over a year and has a tremendous impact on the art world in general. The man is so damn talented it's freaky! He's even kind of weirded out about it! He suffered several strokes a few years ago and get this, since he can't use his right hand anymore he's started drawing and painting with his left!

That's how I felt watching this old favorite from my teen years.The cliche-ridden story, written by Roy Thomas and Gerry Conway (the guys who are best known for giving us the Conan the Barbarian comic books, and who, along with Frank Frazetta, helped revitalize interest in Robert E. Howard's famed barbarian back in the '70's), is as bad as a plate of week old chinese food that's been left out in the sun. Not a lot of plot, other than the usual: There's a cranky, momma's boy-evil wizard out to dominate the world, and his domineering mother, who - mistakenly - believes that her - uh - gay, purple-skinned son is somehow in need of a consort, goes and kidnaps a buxom, medievally bikini-clad babe for him (Although they admittedly look fantastic, I've never quite understood why bikini's are the favored jungle wardrobe staple of the buxom-babe/damsel in distress, but there you go). The evil wizard, obviously not the least bit interested, imprisons the hottie in his dastardly mountain lair while he pursues his real passion for total jungle domination. Eventually, the wizard is satisfyingly vanquished by a pair of lusty, muscle-bound savages, and the gorgeous babe is rescued (bikini relatively intact - this is a PG-rated sword & sorcery epic, after all).Stretching the cheesiness factor is the crummy, saturday-morning cartoonish rotoscoping animation from Director Ralph Bakshi; a cheap, time-saving technology that was panned as cheating even back in the early '80's, and which, incredibly, even manages to overwhelm and deaden the character designs from the great Frank Frazetta.As for the extras, there's some cool stuff. With the amazing, full-length Frazetta documentary 'Painting With Fire' (also available as a separate, stand-alone DVD) included on the second disk, the extra's are almost enough to justify the $30 expense, even if the actual film hasn't aged so well. The commentary track with Bakshi - who I really do like - is fun, and the old guy still seems frisky and as interested in filmmaking as he was twenty and thirty years ago. The making of documentary is pretty typical stuff, as is the behind-the-scenes still gallery, and the Diary Notes from voice-actor Sean Hannon is a throwaway addition to the package.The film transfer for the Limited Edition is fine.

It's not a very professional film -- the sound is garbled at times and the color often flat -- but it's loving without being reverent, and a lot of fun. Not worth $20 (what I paid for the 2 DVD set), but watch for it in used bins.===================Mercy but this is an awesomely bad buy. I haven't watched the Frazetta bio on the second DVD, but I don't know how it could be good enough to balance the sheer awfulness of Fire and Ice. Setting aside the really ugly politics of the film (it manages to be racist, sexist, and homophobic with the gusto of a gang of guys in soiled T-shirts drinking beer in a poorly lit bar), it is incoherent and visually pedestrian. How the wick do you make Frazetta visually pedestrian? Bakshi should get a special award... and a defamation suit from the Frazetta family.The storyline makes an adolescent D&D; game seem like Tolkien. The kingdom of fire (run by an elderly Hulk Hogan clone) is fighting the evil kingdom of ice (run by a stereotypically gay Elric of Melnibone clone) and losing. But at all costs, they must not use lava!! Except at the end, they do. Uh, what? One character swims underwater to a place that is apparently hundreds of miles from where she went into the water to escape a gang of ice guys, but the ice guys find her again anyway. A major character, finally identified in the credits as ""Dark Wolf"" and the only non-Aryan in the film who isn't a grunting moron, turns up whenever needed to rescue the hero (say what?) and heroine. He's the ultimate deus ex machina. At one point, he shows up on an island the rest of them took a ship journey to reach.... The heroine spends most of her time jiggling, and without chiaroscuro, it's about as reminiscent of Frazetta's delightful bimbos as a drawing above a latrine. The denouement begins with the heroine, who has spent the entire movie, including days in a fortress of ice, wearing a sheer bikini with enough fabric, total, to make a square of toilet paper (She does mention at one point that it's cold), exhorting the pale lavender villain to ""take her hand in peace."" Oh yeah, Right. And the ice king has unlimited magic powers, but chooses to fight the hero with a sword. Oh, and not to give anything away, when they are inconvenient to finishing the plot, his powers are suddenly NOT unlimited except nobody explains how or how come.The movie is accompanied by a sweaty ""Making of"" film in which Ralph Bakshi guffaws about keeping pictures of the ""200"" women who stripped for him to audition for the heroine, compares Frazetta to Rembrandt (""I mean,"" he concludes, ""thing kabowdit! I got to work wit' frickin' REMbrandt!!"" Yeah right. And lots of footage about the revolutionary cartooning technique (Rotoscoping, which did wonderful things for Betty Boop before I -- or Bakshi -- was born) that results in realistic body movement superimposed on landscapes and scenery flat as a Saturday morning He-Man cartoon.Now, I was not expecting Tolkien (though I shudder to think what the Bakshi aesthetic made of Lord of the Rings), but this film was both inane and revolting. Which is quite a hat trick. For all its hommages to Frazetta's art (""Dark Wolf"" is ""The Death Dealer,"" as Bakshi reminds us repeatedly, and one or two scenes are effectively plagiarized from Conan covers), what Bakshi has preserved here is not the glorious fantasy artist, but Frazetta's crude and occasionally charming doodles.

Tucker ""Tucker at large""","[14, 17]","As a fond admirer of the artwork of Frank Frazetta, and a guy who appreciates even cheesy movies and a sap for Ralph Bakshi's films my hopes for this film were pretty high. Too high? Perhaps, but in comparison to other animated films this one falls pretty short of decent (check out truly great animated films like ""Princess Mononoke"", ""The Secret of Nimh"" and ""The Iron Giant"" to see what I mean). The rotoscoping technique bothered me not one wit. The background stills paintings provided by Thomas Kinkade (""Painter of Light"") and James (""Dinotopia"") Gurney are gorgeous for the most part. The character designs are good enough. The story is, well, horrid. Thomas and Conway present the worst cliches in this tale that is so simple it's hard to believe even a first year grad student could mess it up. Then there are the animaters who, apparently decided to rachet up the oomph factor for Tigra. It's bad enough that she's realized as a flighty, air-head of a princess with no redeemable value but then her over-endowed body in some shots are just outrageous(trying to draw like Frazetta is a lost cause; animators, note his thick wrists and compact builds, please, it ain't easy imitating a lifetime of established skills). The hero, Lar, is a pretty tough character but he also is victim to awkward dialogue and ridiculous escapes. And why is everyone in the frozen ""Ice Keep"" dressed for a day at the beach, a hot day at the beach to boot? The only characters worth their credits are Steve Sandor as Darkwolf (Frazetta's Death Dealer, slumming perhaps?) and Leo Gordon as King Jerol (sp?). The rest of the cast have their moments but they are all too brief. There are some great fight scenes. There are times when the action is nothing short of breathtaking. Then the characters start speaking again and it's ""ARGH..!!"" time all over again.This animated film pretty much proves to me that the true dream projects are not the ones I anticpate, but instead are the ones I haplessly discover. I wished after all these years of not seeing it I would rediscover a scratched but worthy gem. I come away thinking instead, how could they have screwed this up? Another potentially wonderful film deserving the discount bin treatment.The second disc ""Painting with Fire"" is the real reason to own this disc set. This, well thought out and beautifully flawed attempt to put Frank Frazetta's life into perspective is inspired and enjoyable.

More often, I wonder what I was thinking when I was enthralled with them. In this case, though, I don't need to do either--when Fire and Ice came out, I was fourteen years old, male, and not terribly experienced with the opposite sex--in other words, I was Ralph Bakshi's exact target audience. Now I'm thirty-eight, married, and have a more encyclopedic knowledge of eighties and nineties exploitation cinema (read: porn) than I'm sure anyone in my family would like to acknowledge; rewatching Fire and Ice these days, I look back and grieve that my fourteen-year-old self had such bad taste. (But then, in 1983, my all-time favorite movie was Deathsport. No, I can't explain it either.)Fire and Ice, which All-Movie Guide calls ""Bakshi's last stab at epic fantasy"", concerns two kingdoms, the established human kingdom ruled by fire, and the upstart kingdom of outcasts and half-breeds, the kingdom of Ice. Needless to say, one is wise and good, and the other is twisted and evil. Interestingly, there are a few places in the script where denizens of either kingdom could waver from their one-dimensionality and suddenly bring depth and richness to the script; we're dangling there waiting for Bakshi to drop the apple into our mouths, but of course it's snatched away as quickly as it's offered. Cruel, I tell you. But then, no one's supposed to be paying attention to the script; we're supposed to be too busy, erm, ""watching"" Tigre (voice of Cynthia Leake), who starts the movie wearing something that looks as if it's supposed to be a diaphanous lavender negligee over a couple of pieces of filmy stuff that pass as underwear. But only for the first third of the movie, after which the negligee-thing goes away. Draw some luscious, and entirely unrealistic, curves, and the audience's collective brain will be interested in nothing else; at least, this seems to have been the thinking behind this production. (Add in a cameo from Batman--and I swear, the character looks like the ancestor of the animated version of Batman from the seventies--and you'll kill off the last few collective brain cells still struggling to recover from the onslaught of Tigre-flesh.)But the worst part is that, after realizing all this, I still sat through the entire eighty-one minutes this weekend.

There's the Sinbad classics and everyone knows about Conan. You could add Willow, the Neverending Story and maybe the Dark Crystal, maybe also Krull, and of course the Lord of the Rings trilogy. I think this one's up there with those. Yes it's chock full of just about every fantasy cliche, but that's exactly part of what makes it so great for any fantasy fan. All that cliche makes it perfect. All the elements of sword n sorcery fantasy are here. Some people complain about roto scoping animation, but I think it looks awesome, even by todays standards.

What you have here is swords and sorcery cel-animated movie with all the style of Schwarzenegger's Conan the Barbarian. Bakshi collaborated with famed fantasy artist Frank Frazetta in making the imagery of this movie and it shows. There is an intelligence to this movie that stands out above just about all of the barbarian movies made even up to now (with the original Conan being the only exception).They use a rotoscoping technique that gives the animation a lifelike fluidity found in some of the classic Disney movies like Sleeping Beauty, but keep in mind this is by no means a Disney movie. In other words: THIS MOVIE IS NOT FOR CHILDREN. There is a heck of a lot of violence and scantily clad people on this picture. While it is rated PG I think by today's standards it's more PG-13.The DVD transfer is nice and clean. The making of featurette is actually quite interesting as you get to see how much they put into the material they rotoscope. They used real actors and stuntpeople, in costume, to actually perform all the stuff you see animated. No wonder that the movie has a high level of subtle detail after seeing this featurette. I haven't seen the Frazetta documentary yet, but I keep hearing it's really good. As a hack and slash, barbarian warrior kind of movie this is great.

918977,A7OBFVHNJGI2A,B000A2LV4W,Timothy Hulsey,"[7, 12]","Possibly the least ambitious film of Ralph Bakshi's career, ""Fire and Ice"" is a middling sword-and-sorcery epic with one-dimensional characters, a hackneyed story, crummy acting and awful dialogue.  But what would be laughable or simply unwatchable in live action proves passably entertaining in animation.Renowned fantasy illustrator Frank Frazetta is listed as a co-producer, but his influence seems more apparent in the garish background work (much of it painted by Thomas Kinkade) than in the flat character designs.  Still, ""Fire and Ice"" features several nicely staged action sequences, and William Kraft's melodramatic score makes the story seem more consequential than it is.  Even Bakshi's rotoscope work, with its clumsy mimicry of live-action cinematography, has an unexpected primitive charm.Alas, ""Fire and Ice"" is as racist, sexist and homophobic as movies get, which may explain why 20th Century Fox buried the flick in 1983.  Since then, Bakshi fans have had to make do with cheap pan-and-scan VHS tapes or homemade dubs from late-night TV.  For them, this 2-disc DVD edition, which finally presents ""Fire and Ice"" in its proper widescreen ratio, will be well worth the steep purchase price.  For nonfans, this modest effort will demonstrate what can be done by a handful of talented and ambitious personnel with a shoestring budget, but otherwise doesn't merit so much as a passing glance.",3,Fantasy on the cheap,1147046400,"05 8, 2006",2006,1406,"['Possibly', 'least', 'ambitious', 'film', 'Ralph', 'Bakshi', 'career', 'Fire', 'Ice', 'middling', 'sword-and-sorcery', 'epic', 'one-dimensional', 'characters', 'hackneyed', 'story', 'crummy', 'acting', 'awful', 'dialogue', 'what', 'would', 'be', 'laughable', 'simply', 'unwatchable', 'live', 'action', 'passably', 'entertaining', 'animation.Renowned', 'fantasy', 'illustrator', 'Frank', 'Frazetta', 'listed', 'co-producer', 'influence', 'more', 'apparent', 'garish', 'background', 'work', 'much', 'painted', 'Thomas', 'Kinkade', 'flat', 'character', 'designs', 'Still', 'Fire', 'Ice', 'several', 'nicely', 'staged', 'action', 'sequences', 'William', 'Kraft', 'melodramatic', 'score', 'story', 'seem', 'more', 'consequential', 'Even', 'Bakshi', 'rotoscope', 'work', 'clumsy', 'mimicry', 'live-action', 'cinematography', 'unexpected', 'primitive', 'charm.Alas', 'Fire', 'Ice', 'racist', 'sexist', 'homophobic', 'movies', 'get', 'may', 'explain', 'why', '20th', 'Century', 'Fox', 'buried', 'flick', '1983', 'then', 'Bakshi', 'fans', 'have', 'had', 'make', 'do', 'cheap', 'pan-and-scan', 'VHS', 'tapes', 'homemade', 'dubs', 'late-night', 'TV', '2-disc', 'DVD', 'edition', 'finally', 'Fire', 'Ice', 'proper', 'widescreen', 'ratio', 'will', 'be', 'well', 'steep', 'purchase', 'price', 'nonfans', 'modest', 'effort', 'will', 'demonstrate', 'what', 'can', 'be', 'done', 'handful', 'talented', 'ambitious', 'personnel', 'shoestring', 'budget', 'otherwise', ""n't"", 'merit', 'so', 'much', 'passing', 'glance']",N/A

As in Bakshi's other best movies, it's rotoscoped cel animation over painted backgrounds, a combination I like a lot. That gives completely natural movement to the animated figures, and great atmosphere from the backgrounds.There were a few negatives in this DVD. First was transfer quality. There's a visible amount of ""snow"" in many places, enough to notice, but not enough to get in the way of the movie. Then there's the inherently loose relationship between the cel animation and the backgrounds - a few scenes seemed to have the characters skating across the surroundings. Excessive reality can also be a drawback. Teegra, the female lead, spent a lot of time running from the bad guys. Unfortunately, she tended to ""run like a girl"" (and I don't mean Jackie Joyner Kersee) - she rarely conveyed the athletic or panicked sense I would have expected of a woman running for her life.The positives far outweigh the problems, though. Frazetta's characters are richly drawn: lush womanly figures, mighty males, grunting hench-beings, and the Death Dealer. The story holds together, and the rotoscoped actors did great jobs. And the DVD extras - wow. I normally ignore them. These aren't just a few stills and a trailer, there are interviews with Bakshi, diary notes from one of the actors, and a whole second disc dedicated to Frazetta and his work (""Painting with Fire""). I haven't gone through all of the extras yet, but they earned that fifth star for this set.It's not as ""adult"" as Fritz the Cat and other of Bakshi's work, but it's certainly not for the kiddies, either. But then, not all animation has to be.
