The interviews were superb & enlightning to this great man. I am perplexed as how when he picked a prima ballerina, he seemed to fall in love with their dancing & not so much the woman. He also took it very hard when they chose to move on. I think there is a lot more about this great man that needs to be explored. This is a must see for Balanchine lovers. Of course, the great woman are just as entertaing to watch & listen to.

You must have a deep devotion to dance].  You can't ask for more dedication than that from the ballerinas who participated in this epic DVD.  Their insights, experiences, the little things and the big ones - all completely fascinating.  I will watch this one again and again.  I enjoyed every one's story. They all brought something very special to this homage to Mr. B, but I found Melissa Hayden's the most enjoyable.  She was so articulate and funny.  MG!

Yet I love the ballet as a means to escape the mundane, and celebrate the human physique. The dancers are athletes, only more graceful, careening on stage in an organized disarray. Displaying power and control, they hold back seeming chaos and defy gravity. But it is the choreographer that ultimately pulls their strings, and Mr. Balanchine (Mr. B) was among the best. This documentary covers his life with the New York City Ballet which he basically founded and nourished. In it six of their more famous female artists give brief experiences of their relationship to Mr.B, and this is intersperced with clips of excellent performances. This DVD is a great introduction into the spirit of ballet as well as a great resource of ballet artists.

""Dan""","[47, 49]","I first saw this on PBS - an anthology of interviews with six of the premiere Balachine ballerinas spanning a period of time from the late 40s up until Balachine's retirement and death.  Each lady relates their experiences dancing ""for Mr. B"", with Maria Tallchief's interview being particularly illuminating as she was for a time his wife.  The women have praise and admiration (and very little criticism) for their mentor and choreographer, and their work to keep his choreography alive for future generations.  Sadly Melissa Hayden has passed on since this was made.  Far more than the six represented here could have been part of this documentary (LeClerq, Kirkland, Watts, Farrell, McBride) and it would have been interesting to hear the male dancer's opinion (Martins, Mitchell, d'Amboise, Villella) but that would have required a series.",5,FASCINATING DOCUMENTARY WORTH SEEING AGAIN,1219276800,"08 21, 2008",2008,844,"['first', 'saw', 'PBS', 'anthology', 'interviews', 'six', 'premiere', 'Balachine', 'ballerinas', 'spanning', 'period', 'time', 'late', '40s', 'up', 'Balachine', 'retirement', 'death', 'lady', 'experiences', 'dancing', 'Mr.', 'B', 'Maria', 'Tallchief', 'interview', 'being', 'particularly', 'illuminating', 'was', 'time', 'wife', 'women', 'have', 'praise', 'admiration', 'very', 'little', 'criticism', 'mentor', 'choreographer', 'work', 'keep', 'choreography', 'alive', 'future', 'generations', 'Sadly', 'Melissa', 'Hayden', 'passed', 'was', 'made', 'Far', 'more', 'six', 'represented', 'here', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'part', 'documentary', 'LeClerq', 'Kirkland', 'Watts', 'Farrell', 'McBride', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'interesting', 'hear', 'male', 'dancer', 'opinion', 'Martins', 'Mitchell', ""d'Amboise"", 'Villella', 'would', 'have', 'required', 'series']",Dancing for Mr B: 6 Balanchine Ballerinas VHS
