I like all but two of the movies in the Blood Bath collection. Solid scripts, solid acting. Exceptional for B movies which are often so bad they are laughable.This collection is also a cut above in picture quality, compared to most Mill Creek packs. 11 of the 12 movies were originally released from 2004 to 2008.

1367551,A37M1C40G34OJA,B003VOVW22,Brian,"[0, 0]","Yes, yet another review of a Mill Creek Entertainment product.  This one differs in the simple fact that while these are &#34;Low Budget&#34;, they are sveral steps up from the usual low budget fare that Mill Creek Entertainment puts out in their Multi-Packs & most of these low budget Gems are from accross the pond and were made in England/Europe.I love these more than most, & not just because they are of the &#34;Horror&#34; genre.  The feel & style of these films is far better than most.  And while some don't take themselves that &#34;Seriously&#34;, there still is a good quality about them.  Like &#34;Angst&#34;, while the content is a bit sophomoric, it is really morbidly funny.  Or &#34;Demonic&#34; with Tom Savini, about a goup of Succubi (That is the plural of Succubus).  Plus the film prints are far better than most.If you would like a little something different & better, Blood Bath from Mill Creek Entertainment is it",5,Overseas Low Budget from Mill Creek,1405123200,"07 12, 2014",2014,939,"['Yes', 'yet', 'review', 'Mill', 'Creek', 'Entertainment', 'product', 'one', 'differs', 'simple', 'fact', 'are', '34', 'Low', 'Budget', '34', 'are', 'sveral', 'steps', 'up', 'usual', 'low', 'budget', 'fare', 'Mill', 'Creek', 'Entertainment', 'out', 'Multi-Packs', 'most', 'low', 'budget', 'Gems', 'are', 'pond', 'were', 'made', 'England/Europe.I', 'love', 'more', 'most', 'not', 'just', 'are', '34', 'Horror', '34', 'genre', 'feel', 'style', 'films', 'far', 'better', 'most', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', '34', 'Seriously', '34', 'still', 'good', 'quality', '34', 'Angst', '34', 'content', 'bit', 'sophomoric', 'really', 'morbidly', 'funny', '34', 'Demonic', '34', 'Tom', 'Savini', 'goup', 'Succubi', 'plural', 'Succubus', 'film', 'prints', 'are', 'far', 'better', 'most.If', 'would', 'like', 'little', 'something', 'different', 'better', 'Blood', 'Bath', 'Mill', 'Creek', 'Entertainment']",N/A

For 6.00 you can't go wrong at all. In fact, I was pleasantly surprised by how fun the movies are. I have bought collection like this one before and was pretty disappointed but I have been having fun with these movies. Most are very enjoyable. The effects do come off as kind of cheap in some of the movies but one thing going for them is that they hold your attention from beginning to end and they don't really drag with a few exceptions. The Chambermaid is a lot of fun, but I really enjoyed all of them and plan on watching them again soon. What a great deal by Mill Creek for what you get. I hope they keep releasing these types of movies. Don't let the negative reviews scare you away. You could always rent it or buy it used and if you hate it, you can always sell it back on amazon but you will want to keep it!",5,Movies are NOT that bad!!
