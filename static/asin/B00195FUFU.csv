1161559,A2D7B5I7ZQ51XL,B00195FUFU,Anthony Pittore,"[5, 7]","A family looking for some old roadside attractions to include in the father's coffee-table book come across an ancient, decrepit old freak show run by an eccentric one-eyed man. When their family van breaks down upon leaving the sideshow, they're forced to stay at a nearly abandoned fishing camp that was the site of a prison break decades prior.There have been many films in the 'freak' subgenre of horror, ranging from Tod Browning's beloved 'Freaks' (1932) to Alex Winter's hilarious 'Freaked' (1993). Those are both classics (or soon-to-be with 'Freaked'). 'Side Sho,' however, never will be. And if it ever does reach classic status. . . well, it will be an obvious clue to the sad state of our genre. From the ridiculously bad opening song to the 17-year-old daughter that's obviously older than her natural mother, this film did not have much going for it. The writing was subpar, but not completely awful. . . just boring. The direction was poor, and the rare freak effects were pretty horrendous and unbelievable. The acting was abysmal and the casting was even worse. Anyone who would believe the ages of these two camp-age teenagers must not have met a teenager in a long, long time. There was far from enough gore & violence to make up for the lack of any other quality. . . and when there was a bit of violence, it was not well done at all. And, I can't forget to mention the ending fight scenes which were, with all honesty, some of the worst I've ever, ever seen in a film. Overall, this is an easily forgettable and poorly made horror film that deserves to be left alone at the bottom of the dollar bin.Final verdict: 2.5/10.",1,The other reviewers worked on the film - An UNBIASED review!,1217376000,"07 30, 2008",2008,1642,"['family', 'looking', 'old', 'roadside', 'attractions', 'include', 'father', 'coffee-table', 'book', 'come', 'ancient', 'decrepit', 'old', 'freak', 'show', 'run', 'eccentric', 'one-eyed', 'man', 'When', 'family', 'van', 'breaks', 'down', 'leaving', 'sideshow', ""'re"", 'forced', 'stay', 'nearly', 'abandoned', 'fishing', 'camp', 'was', 'site', 'prison', 'break', 'decades', 'prior.There', 'have', 'been', 'many', 'films', ""'freak"", 'subgenre', 'horror', 'ranging', 'Tod', 'Browning', 'beloved', ""'Freaks"", '1932', 'Alex', 'Winter', 'hilarious', ""'Freaked"", '1993', 'are', 'classics', 'soon-to-be', ""'Freaked"", 'Sho', 'however', 'never', 'will', 'be', 'ever', 'reach', 'classic', 'status', 'well', 'will', 'be', 'obvious', 'clue', 'sad', 'state', 'genre', 'ridiculously', 'bad', 'opening', 'song', '17-year-old', 'daughter', 'obviously', 'older', 'natural', 'mother', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'much', 'going', 'writing', 'was', 'subpar', 'not', 'completely', 'awful', 'just', 'boring', 'direction', 'was', 'poor', 'rare', 'freak', 'effects', 'were', 'pretty', 'horrendous', 'unbelievable', 'acting', 'was', 'abysmal', 'casting', 'was', 'even', 'worse', 'Anyone', 'who', 'would', 'believe', 'ages', 'two', 'camp-age', 'teenagers', 'must', 'not', 'have', 'met', 'teenager', 'long', 'long', 'time', 'was', 'far', 'enough', 'gore', 'violence', 'make', 'up', 'lack', 'other', 'quality', 'when', 'was', 'bit', 'violence', 'was', 'not', 'well', 'done', 'ca', ""n't"", 'forget', 'mention', 'ending', 'fight', 'scenes', 'were', 'honesty', 'worst', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'ever', 'seen', 'film', 'Overall', 'easily', 'forgettable', 'poorly', 'made', 'horror', 'film', 'be', 'left', 'alone', 'bottom', 'dollar', 'bin.Final', 'verdict', '2.5/10']",Side Sho aka Side Show

Mom and son play along to keep dad happy. They all find out it's a lot more than just a harmless attraction. FREAKY PEOPLE HANG OUT THERE!!!This ain't a bad movie. It's called Side Sho, minus the ""w"", because the Side Show sign is missing the last letter at the first of the film. The letter has either fallen off or faded out.I swear, during the first half of the movie, all I could think about is how much the overall look of the family reminded me of just about any family in an old ABC ""After School Special"". I'm pretty sure that's the look they were going for. If that's not the look they were going for, it's the look they ended up having.The second half of the movie really gets going with some pretty good fight scenes. I was suprised by the characters that were killed off and the ending is ironic.The dude that played the ""Dog Thing"" is one of the greatest physical actors of all time. This alone is worth getting the movie for. A lot of people can bark or make a noise like a dog. This guy opened up and revealed his inner dog. He's more dog than man.
