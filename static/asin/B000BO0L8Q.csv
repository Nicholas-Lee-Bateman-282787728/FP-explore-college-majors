946091,A3JTBJC5WSEZ7Q,B000BO0L8Q,Thomas M. Sipos,"[0, 0]","An alien crash-lands in the Canadian woods. He's not too bright, enjoys getting drunk, is fearful, and entertains his new Earth friends by levitating objects. Meanwhile, the US military wants to capture or kill him.I don't know where all these 5 star reviews are coming from. PHIL THE ALIEN is a low-budget Canadian TV movie (it's credited to Canadian Telefilm). Most of the story is set at the Canadian Tavern. The characters later visit the Canadian Motel.I think those names are supposed to satirize the Canadian government's heavy-handed pressure to fill Canadian-funded productions with ""Canadian content."" That was the satirical target of the brilliant SCTV's ""Great White North"" skits.But PHIL THE ALIEN is no SCTV. Its satirical targets are very old and/or very politically correct: drunks, Christians, gun-toting rednecks, bickering garage bands, evil American military/intelligence operatives.PHIL THE ALIEN is not a horrible film, it's just not very good. I smiled a few times, but no laugh-out-loud moments. The actors feel as if they're just going through the motions. One-dimensional performances with no emotional depth.I bought PHIL THE ALIEN on Amazon, a brand new copy for one penny. I guess that was a fair price.",2,bland Canadian TV movie,1333584000,"04 5, 2012",2012,1232,"['alien', 'crash-lands', 'Canadian', 'woods', 'not', 'too', 'bright', 'getting', 'drunk', 'fearful', 'new', 'Earth', 'friends', 'levitating', 'objects', 'Meanwhile', 'US', 'military', 'capture', 'kill', 'him.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'where', '5', 'star', 'reviews', 'are', 'coming', 'PHIL', 'ALIEN', 'low-budget', 'Canadian', 'TV', 'movie', 'credited', 'Canadian', 'Telefilm', 'Most', 'story', 'set', 'Canadian', 'Tavern', 'characters', 'later', 'visit', 'Canadian', 'Motel.I', 'think', 'names', 'are', 'supposed', 'satirize', 'Canadian', 'government', 'heavy-handed', 'pressure', 'fill', 'Canadian-funded', 'productions', 'Canadian', 'content', 'was', 'satirical', 'target', 'brilliant', 'SCTV', 'Great', 'White', 'North', 'skits.But', 'PHIL', 'THE', 'ALIEN', 'SCTV', 'satirical', 'targets', 'are', 'very', 'old', 'and/or', 'very', 'politically', 'correct', 'drunks', 'Christians', 'gun-toting', 'rednecks', 'bickering', 'garage', 'bands', 'evil', 'American', 'military/intelligence', 'operatives.PHIL', 'THE', 'ALIEN', 'not', 'horrible', 'film', 'just', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'smiled', 'few', 'times', 'laugh-out-loud', 'moments', 'actors', 'feel', ""'re"", 'just', 'going', 'motions', 'One-dimensional', 'performances', 'emotional', 'depth.I', 'bought', 'PHIL', 'THE', 'ALIEN', 'Amazon', 'brand', 'new', 'copy', 'one', 'penny', 'guess', 'was', 'fair', 'price']",Phil the Alien
