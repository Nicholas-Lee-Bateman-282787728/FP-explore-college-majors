The acting was professional (the kids did a great job. And Sam Elliot - what a good looking older man!), the scenery beautiful and the concept behind the movie - moving the holidays forward a month - a novel one. The story was not built around inducing the viewers tears with deathbed scenes, but the life of a sick little girl and a neighbor with a big heart. Yes, I will admit the ending may have gotten a bit carried away and there were certain characters we're left hanging on (the teenage girl working on her children's book?) but other than that, this is truly a heart-warming film with a terrific cast! (Not that I'd ever pay $30 (asking price) for this movie! Good grief.
