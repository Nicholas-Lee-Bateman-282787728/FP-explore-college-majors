Cassie is having some income issues though, and has made the decision to open up Greyhouse as a bed and breakfast.

The town plans a bicentennial celebration to take place at her garden.  To make ends meet, she takes in a lodger, making her gorgeous home a B&B.;  The handsome but creepily, smug lodger along with the mayor's wife plot other devices to spoil the good witch's peaceful existence.There exist five stories going on: Cassie and the sheriff's romance and potential engagement; the loss of Grey House; the sheriff's son falling into bad company, the sheriff's daughter encounter with a disturbed classmate, and fifth, grandpa's love life.  All of these play into Cassie's benevolent hands one way or another.I'd rate the movie PG for mild thematic elements, but the whole family can watch.  Our elementary aged children like these tales.  They really enjoy her cat and the sense that she can perform magic and will save the day.  Co-producer and star Catherine Bell is perfect in the role: elegant but simple, mystical but loving and kind, and with a great knowing look like her cat.  Chris Potter returns as the sensible, practical, at times befuddled, lawman boyfriend.More tales to come, and they keep you wondering if she really is what the kids think she is.",4,Is She or Isn't She?,1399852800,"05 12, 2014",2014,1370,"['Finally', 'release', 'next', 'installment', 'Hallmark', 'Good', 'Witch', 'series', 'retruning', 'Middleton', 'Grey', 'House', 'beautifully', 'mysterious', 'Cassie.This', 'time', 'see', 'Cassie', 'fantastic', 'not', 'magical', 'garden', 'town', 'bicentennial', 'celebration', 'take', 'place', 'garden', 'make', 'ends', 'meet', 'lodger', 'making', 'gorgeous', 'home', 'B', 'B', 'handsome', 'creepily', 'smug', 'lodger', 'mayor', 'wife', 'plot', 'other', 'devices', 'spoil', 'good', 'witch', 'peaceful', 'existence.There', 'exist', 'five', 'stories', 'going', 'Cassie', 'sheriff', 'romance', 'potential', 'engagement', 'loss', 'Grey', 'House', 'sheriff', 'son', 'falling', 'bad', 'company', 'sheriff', 'daughter', 'encounter', 'disturbed', 'classmate', 'fifth', 'grandpa', 'love', 'life', 'play', 'Cassie', 'benevolent', 'one', 'way', 'another.I', ""'d"", 'rate', 'movie', 'PG', 'mild', 'thematic', 'elements', 'whole', 'family', 'can', 'watch', 'elementary', 'aged', 'children', 'tales', 'really', 'enjoy', 'cat', 'sense', 'can', 'perform', 'magic', 'will', 'save', 'day', 'Co-producer', 'star', 'Catherine', 'Bell', 'perfect', 'role', 'elegant', 'simple', 'mystical', 'loving', 'kind', 'great', 'knowing', 'look', 'cat', 'Chris', 'Potter', 'sensible', 'practical', 'times', 'befuddled', 'lawman', 'boyfriend.More', 'tales', 'come', 'keep', 'wondering', 'really', 'what', 'kids', 'think']",Good Witch's Garden (Hallmark)
