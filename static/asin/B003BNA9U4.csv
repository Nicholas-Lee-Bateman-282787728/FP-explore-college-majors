She is very fugly when you look at her upclose without hair.  She's definitely an airhead.  I've never heard her say a word other than love, passion and heart.  Listen especially to her speech at that Asian press conference where she was asked to talk about ""power.""  haha Having said that, I enjoyed it because I like some of her songs and watching her ride in her little plane with an oxygen mask on.  My favorite songs are It's All Coming Back and To Love You More.  I had tickets to one of the Vegas shows that she cancelled after the audience was sitting in their seats for an hour.  No medical breakthoughs when you see a crew of doctors shoving cameras in her mouth, she just likes the attention.  Her oxygen mask is a placebo.  This disc is the full 3 hour documentary.  The version in theatres was a 2 hour edit.  I like how the netflix description said she did all this while raising a child at the same time because we know she did all the work there!  haha.  I like it when she beats her chest and her fingers go spastic then she salutes!  Overall, it's a funny little flick and it actually shows a lot of full song performances from the tour.

While all that is true, what can be learned through watching this is just what drives Celine to continue her strenuous career. The most interesting part of the documentary is when Celine begins having vocal problems. She cancels some shows which lets down many of her fans. She recovers but the vocal problems return. Before one concert is about to begin, she tells her crew that she is having a hard time speaking. She is reluctant to go on with the show but does anyway. She manages to make it through but her voice sounds strained as she belts out ""All By Myself."" After the show, someone says to her ""Well, it's over"" and Celine replies ""Yes but at what cost?"" knowing that straining her voice in this manner could permanently damage her voice. Moments later you find out just why she went on with the show. She's confronted with a fan who says she was in ICU and thinking of Celine helped her want to live. It is moments like this that you see just how connected Celine is with her fans. And looking out in the audience during any of her concerts, you will see just how connected they are to her. Critics can say what they want, but Celine has touched the lives of millions of people around the world and this film shows the obligation she feels towards them to not let them down.At the end of the movie, when the tour is over Celine is asked how long until she is performing again. She says a year and a half. I really wish she would reconsider that. She needs way more rest than that. Her fans are loyal and will wait however many years it takes. But Celine really needs to take an long break from performing these grueling schedules. Barbra Streisand's voice didn't start to fade until she was in her 60's. Celine's voice is already starting to weaken and she's only in her 40's. She really need to take care of it if she wants to have a career as long as Barbra's.Celine really is one of the hardest working women in show business and she is one hell of a performer. Her concerts are high energy and women (and men) love watching her on stage. You would think her concerts would be filled with mostly women but looking at the footage in this documentary shows it's pretty evenly split among genders of who is a fan. And I really doubt all the guys are gay.I also gotta say this documentary looks fantastic on BluRay.",5,Surprisingly touching film,1273881600,"05 15, 2010",2010,2494,"['did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'learn', 'anything', 'Celine', 'Dion', 'watching', 'movie', 'other', 'extremely', 'rich', 'nice', 'people', 'child', 'personality', 'true', 'what', 'can', 'be', 'learned', 'watching', 'just', 'what', 'Celine', 'continue', 'strenuous', 'career', 'most', 'interesting', 'part', 'documentary', 'when', 'Celine', 'having', 'vocal', 'problems', 'shows', 'lets', 'down', 'many', 'fans', 'vocal', 'problems', 'return', 'one', 'concert', 'begin', 'crew', 'having', 'hard', 'time', 'speaking', 'reluctant', 'go', 'show', 'anyway', 'make', 'voice', 'sounds', 'strained', 'Myself', 'show', 'someone', 'Well', 'Celine', 'Yes', 'what', 'cost', 'knowing', 'straining', 'voice', 'manner', 'could', 'permanently', 'damage', 'voice', 'Moments', 'later', 'find', 'out', 'just', 'why', 'went', 'show', 'confronted', 'fan', 'who', 'was', 'ICU', 'thinking', 'Celine', 'helped', 'want', 'live', 'moments', 'see', 'just', 'how', 'connected', 'Celine', 'fans', 'looking', 'out', 'audience', 'concerts', 'will', 'see', 'just', 'how', 'connected', 'are', 'Critics', 'can', 'say', 'what', 'want', 'Celine', 'touched', 'lives', 'millions', 'people', 'world', 'film', 'obligation', 'towards', 'not', 'let', 'down.At', 'end', 'movie', 'when', 'tour', 'Celine', 'asked', 'how', 'long', 'performing', 'again', 'year', 'half', 'really', 'wish', 'would', 'reconsider', 'way', 'more', 'rest', 'fans', 'are', 'loyal', 'will', 'wait', 'however', 'many', 'years', 'Celine', 'really', 'take', 'long', 'break', 'performing', 'grueling', 'schedules', 'Barbra', 'Streisand', 'voice', 'did', ""n't"", 'start', 'fade', 'was', '60', 'Celine', 'voice', 'already', 'starting', 'weaken', 'only', '40', 'really', 'need', 'take', 'care', 'have', 'career', 'as', 'long', ""Barbra's.Celine"", 'really', 'one', 'hardest', 'working', 'women', 'show', 'business', 'one', 'hell', 'performer', 'concerts', 'are', 'high', 'energy', 'women', 'men', 'love', 'watching', 'stage', 'would', 'think', 'concerts', 'would', 'be', 'filled', 'mostly', 'women', 'looking', 'footage', 'documentary', 'pretty', 'evenly', 'split', 'genders', 'who', 'fan', 'really', 'doubt', 'guys', 'are', 'gay.I', 'also', 'got', 'ta', 'say', 'documentary', 'fantastic', 'BluRay']",N/A

Perez ""rperez_01""","[123, 128]","If you are expecting to see Celine Dion perform her hits on this film, then DO NOT buy it: IT IS A BACKSTAGE/TOUR DOCUMENTARY, NOT A CONCERT (That is why theTaking Chances World Tour: The Concert (DVD/CD)is being released on the same day.) This doc follows Celine, husband, child, and other relatives on the family journey that turned out to be the Taking Chances World Tour, officially the 2nd highest grossing tour of all time by a female artist . We see Celine prepping to go onstage, her and her family sightseeing at each tour stop (visiting Nelson Mandela's cell; going on a safari), and her receiving the 'L&eacute;gion d'honneur' Medal from French President Nicolas Sarkozy. Through film, one experiences the REAL Celine, which is the same Celine we see onstage: true, kind, and sensitive. We see her laugh, and at certain moments, cry, such as when she was forced to postpone several tour dates due to a throat infection, and again when her son, RC, thinks he has lost a childhood toy, which later turns up at a hotel. On instances, we do see Celine performing some songs, but only snippets; most of the song is used as background/transition music from scene to scene. The DVD has an extra hour of added footage- maybe there'll be more music during it, but the main film hasn't too much.This film is a MUST for every Celine fan.

Who doesn't know the extremely ubiquitous Titanic theme song? Celine has been the hardest-working woman in show business for the past 30 years, and now we get a sneak peek at her life on the road during her blockbuster Taking Chances World Tour, and boy, is it every Celine fan's dream. Concert performances are intermingled with backstage footage, downtime with family, birthday parties, doctor visits, the whole works.""Through The Eyes Of The World"" offers viewers a glimpse at Celine - unscripted. Her warmth and genuine affection for others shines through, as does the fact that the woman is quite goofy and crazy at times - in a very good way, one that allows viewers to relate to her.This is not a film for those who absolutely detest Celine - it won't change your mind about her as a person or as a vocalist/performer. If you're neutral or lukewarm, it might be worth a look. But mostly, it's for those of us who are die-hard fans and want to see more of Celine. This film is even heavy on concert performances for us big time fans who love seeing Celine do what she does best.The DVD has no extras - none are necessary, especially since the home video release of the film is roughly an hour longer than the theatrically released version. It's presented in 16:9 anamorphic widescreen and the picture is flawless, as expected for a recent production shot in high definition. The audio is presented in Dolby Digital 2.0 and 5.1 and does the job splendidly. My only miff, despite not having a Blu-Ray player, is that this has a Blu-Ray disc while the concert does not. Why is that? Did Sony not think folks would want the full concert in hi-def too?""Celine: Through The Eyes Of The World"" is worth every cent if you're a Celine fan. Pristine picture and sound, which definitely becomes important during the concert performances, and plenty of reminders of why us die-hard Celine fans love her. Yes, the chart stats, sales numbers, awards, ticket sales, etc. are impressive, but the film shows Celine's personality, work ethic, and fantastic talent - the real reason that she remains a beloved entertainer three decades after her first single in Quebec.
