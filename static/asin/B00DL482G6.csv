With a piqued interest, the other turkeys wanted to know what that was. The turkey opened the gate and lead the other turkeys to an open field where he taught them to fly.Over the barn, across the field, by the duck pond and soaring far above the small town the turkeys went with their thrilling newfound ability.Finally, the day had drawn to a close and the turkeys returned to the spot where they first learned to fly. After relating the day's events, they then walked home and shut the gate behind them.As a flaming homosexual, liberal, democrat, self-moderate drinker, and well-respected public figure, it is important for me to impose my correct thoughts, actions and overall matra upon people. Most particularly, children need to be brought into acceptance and enacting these principles through their daily living. In turn others can and should be influenced to do the same things.Obtaining an early release of this movie for home use, I take advantage of every opportunity I can be afforded to have children over to watch in in my home theather. The aforementioned intentions have delivered mixed results after they have viewed this movie. Many times, I see the children leave my home with their Republican parents in large enviromentally harmful SUVs and going to McDonald's for a vile juicy cheeseburger.Not since the ""Lorax"" came out has a movie attempted to break the norm by indoctrinating guilt concepts that can reform young minds. This movie should get a five-star rating for effort for its bold message, but since the kids are still slow to learn after seeing it, I can only give it one as the results are not to my liking.However, I am tempted to give it another star just for the sexual tension between the two male turkeys in the movie.",1,Kids eat pizza instead of turkey at the end of the movie,1389052800,"01 7, 2014",2014,1957,"['One', 'morning', 'was', 'turkey', 'who', 'rushed', 'up', 'other', 'turkey', 'friends', 'farm', 'great', 'enthusiasm', 'saying', 'guys', 'guys', 'just', 'got', 'back', 'hanging', 'out', 'eagles', 'learned', 'fly', 'piqued', 'interest', 'other', 'turkeys', 'wanted', 'know', 'what', 'was', 'turkey', 'opened', 'gate', 'lead', 'other', 'turkeys', 'open', 'field', 'where', 'taught', 'fly.Over', 'barn', 'field', 'duck', 'pond', 'soaring', 'far', 'small', 'town', 'turkeys', 'went', 'thrilling', 'ability.Finally', 'day', 'had', 'drawn', 'close', 'turkeys', 'returned', 'spot', 'where', 'first', 'learned', 'fly', 'relating', 'day', 'events', 'then', 'walked', 'home', 'shut', 'gate', 'them.As', 'flaming', 'homosexual', 'liberal', 'democrat', 'self-moderate', 'drinker', 'well-respected', 'public', 'figure', 'important', 'impose', 'correct', 'thoughts', 'actions', 'overall', 'matra', 'people', 'Most', 'particularly', 'children', 'need', 'be', 'brought', 'acceptance', 'enacting', 'principles', 'daily', 'living', 'turn', 'others', 'can', 'should', 'be', 'influenced', 'do', 'same', 'things.Obtaining', 'early', 'release', 'movie', 'home', 'use', 'take', 'advantage', 'opportunity', 'can', 'be', 'afforded', 'have', 'children', 'watch', 'home', 'theather', 'aforementioned', 'intentions', 'have', 'delivered', 'mixed', 'results', 'have', 'viewed', 'movie', 'Many', 'times', 'see', 'children', 'leave', 'home', 'Republican', 'parents', 'large', 'enviromentally', 'harmful', 'SUVs', 'going', 'McDonald', 'vile', 'juicy', 'cheeseburger.Not', 'Lorax', 'came', 'out', 'movie', 'attempted', 'break', 'norm', 'indoctrinating', 'guilt', 'concepts', 'can', 'reform', 'young', 'minds', 'movie', 'should', 'get', 'five-star', 'rating', 'effort', 'bold', 'message', 'kids', 'are', 'still', 'slow', 'learn', 'seeing', 'can', 'only', 'give', 'one', 'results', 'are', 'not', 'liking.However', 'am', 'tempted', 'give', 'star', 'just', 'sexual', 'tension', 'two', 'male', 'turkeys', 'movie']",N/A

1658602,A11YV8Y3CIA8L7,B00DL482G6,"Edward Rubinstein ""Edward Rubinstein""","[9, 21]","This is a humorous children's film featuring the voice of Woody Harrelson, who is one of my favorite actors.I've noticed some negative reviews about this film, some of which were written by right-wing Republicans. I respect everyone's views and hope to create a pathway of compassion and understanding for both sides, conservative or liberal. I don't personally belong to either political party.I must first point out that just because someone is a vegan does not mean they are liberal, just as someone who eats meat is not necessarily a conservative.Woody Harrelson is not only a vegan, raw foodist and health enthusiast, but he is also a patriot and Constitutionalist. Harrelson is neither liberal nor conservative and has made it a point to expose the false left-right paradigm created to distract the general public. Like George Washington, Harrelson opposes the destructive concept of political parties.The main reason why Woody Harrelson is weary of meats is because a large percentage of meats sold in America have been genetically modified and/or contain traces of growth hormones and antibiotics. The other problem is that many chickens and cows are fed GMO grains. GMO (Genetically modified foods) surfaced in the late 1990s and are used by many of the large manufacturers as an attempt to cut costs. The problem is that GMOs were created by scientists in labs and are toxic to humans and animals. Before drawing a conclusion, I encourage everyone to read about GMOs.A true conservative and patriotic American would want to be eating meats and grains made and sold by local farmers here in America. Sadly, many people are eating low-quality meats processed outside of the United States. Monsanto is the largest producer of corn and soybean in North America. Sadly, Monsanto are putting the small family farms out of business through dishonest practices. Read about Monsanto if you have any doubts.Harrelson is hardly a bleeding-heart liberal for opposing the unconstitutional, nondefensive wars in Iraq and Afghanistan which did not benefit America or its people. Think about the irresponsible deficit spending, which many Republicans in Congress currently oppose. Our economy certainly did not benefit and we gained no oil after both wars.

This is a wonderful animated comedy, packed with lots of action and adventure.  Two turkeys team up to travel back in time to try to take turkey off the Thanksgiving menu for good.  If this doesn't sound funny enough, these two turkeys have nothing in common with each other, argue constantly, and run into some hilarious situations when they travel back to pilgrim days.In order to change the course of history, the turkeys, Reggie (Owen Wilson) and Jake (Woody Harrelson), must first learn to get along and put aside their differences.  Reggie is a smart, although a rather lazy and weak turkey, while Jake is a strong and brave turkey, but very dumb.  This duo makes for some great comedy!  Then a female turkey that Reggie has a crush on makes it even funnier!  This role of Jenny is voiced by the very funny Amy Poehler, which could not have been cast any better. The director, Jimmy Hayward, also directed &#34;Horton Hears a Who!&#34;  He is also known for his work on &#34;Finding Nemo,&#34; &#34;Toy Story,&#34; &#34;Monsters Inc.,&#34; and many more great animated hits.  The soundtrack for &#34;Free Birds&#34; is also great. My favorite scene in this movie is when Jake rescues a bunch of baby turkeys, chicks, from a blazing fire.  These adorable, tiny puffballs are clinging to his feathers, and looking up at this massive hero with huge eyes.  It is just too cute!  &#34;Free Birds&#34; is a family movie that is great for all ages.  I give this movie 5 out of 5 stars.  So don't miss out!

Some of the press reviewers seem to have thought the plot too convoluted.  But I understood it all just fine first time around. For its target audience of 7-11 year olds, this is a very fine entertainment. The script is sharp, the diction is clear, and there's a lot of kid style humour.  At the start I thought we were destined for a humdrum turkeys-against-farmer re-run of the forgettable Chicken Run.  But the movie soon takes off, quite literally, in what has got to be the most beautifully art-directed time-machine sequences ever put on screen.  Admittedly some small parts of the animation could be better, especially the hunting dogs which feel like they've escaped from a cheap 1980s Saturday morning cartoon.  The music is nothing to write home about.  But such minor quibbles are petty, when you consider how much else was done well by Reel FX on a low budget.  In exchange we get none of the tedious Shrek-style clowning that's supposed to make animation ""appeal to adults"", just good well-paced storytelling.  There are even some interesting ideas.  Though this isn't the nutty animal rights manifesto that I had feared, and is unlikely to have kids refusing to eat their turkey fritters on Thanksgiving. More interesting is that it shares ideas with the movie Cloud Atlas, oddly: such as the intelligent egg-like Orison; the connections across time; the importance of personal testimony about experience, in terms of changing the future and the past; the creation of new religions and the importance of belief.  But most kids won't see that.

The new wife wanted to make her husband a nice meal and decided to prepare ham. She cuts the nob off the end of the ham tosses it in the trash and puts the rest in a pan to cook it. The husband (confused) asked why she did that because they could eat that. The wife said that's something she saw her mother do when she was a girl.So the couple asked the wife's mother why she cut the end of the ham off and threw it away. The mother told them that it was something she saw her mother do and never knew why. So the couple asked the wife's grandmother why she did that and the grandmother replied that was something she saw her mother do and never knew why. Fortunately the wife's great grandmother was still alive and they asked her why she cut the end of the ham off and tossed in the trash. The great grandmother told them that the pan she had was too small and the ham wouldn't fit so she had to cut the end off so it could fit.There are more to traditions than you think. Just because its always been done a certain way doesn't mean it should always be done a certain way.---------------------------------------------------------End-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------",4,Definately worth watching.,1391817600,"02 8, 2014",2014,2298,"['great', 'movie', 'children', 'ages', 'as', 'well', 'adults', 'begging', 'movie', 'stated', 'very', 'clearly', 'events', 'are', ""n't"", 'accurate', 'history', 'writing', 'team', 'far', 'was', 'can', 'tell', 'have', ""n't"", 'inserted', 'secret', 'message', 'not', 'eat', 'turkey', 'story', 'centered', 'turkey', 'writing', 'did', 'however', 'have', 'lot', 'random', 'bits', 'action', 'was', 'simply', 'hilarious', 'fun', 'watch', 'do', 'get', 'carried', 'away', 'silliness', 'times.Once', 'again', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'attempt', 'include', 'super', 'secret', 'message', 'not', 'eat', 'Turkey', 'thanksgiving', 'other', 'holiday', 'matter', 'simply', 'fun', 'movie', '..most', 'people', 'enjoy.End', 'review', 'Subject', 'Tradition', 'Now', 'wanting', 'go', 'warpath', 'child', 'movie', 'character', ""n't"", 'want', 'people', 'killed', 'let', 'tell', 'story', 'tradition.Once', 'time', 'was', 'young', 'newly', 'wed', 'couple', 'enjoying', 'conversation', 'kitchen', 'new', 'wife', 'wanted', 'make', 'husband', 'nice', 'meal', 'decided', 'prepare', 'ham', 'nob', 'end', 'ham', 'trash', 'rest', 'pan', 'cook', 'husband', 'confused', 'asked', 'why', 'did', 'could', 'eat', 'wife', 'said', 'something', 'saw', 'mother', 'do', 'when', 'was', 'girl.So', 'couple', 'asked', 'wife', 'mother', 'why', 'cut', 'end', 'ham', 'threw', 'away', 'mother', 'told', 'was', 'something', 'saw', 'mother', 'do', 'never', 'knew', 'why', 'couple', 'asked', 'wife', 'grandmother', 'why', 'did', 'grandmother', 'replied', 'was', 'something', 'saw', 'mother', 'do', 'never', 'knew', 'why', 'Fortunately', 'wife', 'great', 'grandmother', 'was', 'still', 'alive', 'asked', 'why', 'cut', 'end', 'ham', 'tossed', 'trash', 'great', 'grandmother', 'told', 'pan', 'had', 'was', 'too', 'small', 'ham', 'would', ""n't"", 'fit', 'so', 'had', 'cut', 'end', 'could', 'fit.There', 'are', 'more', 'traditions', 'think', 'Just', 'always', 'been', 'done', 'certain', 'way', ""n't"", 'mean', 'should', 'always', 'be', 'done', 'certain', 'way.', '-End']",N/A

I have to say I agree with one who says that this movie is not more ""animal-rights-friendly"" than ""Charlotte's Web"" or ""Babe"" or ""Chicken Run"" or any others.I understand that eating Turkey for Thanksgiving is a huge tradition, but I think it's fair and even healthy for our kids to know that there are other options and that you don't HAVE TO eat turkey to have a good holiday.Turkeys fighting for their rights and not wanting to be eaten is pretty natural, if you ask me. Everyone knows the animals they eat did not want to be eaten. It's not new or a secret for kids... or is it? If it hurts to be reminded of it, then maybe people should re-think their eating habits a little!
