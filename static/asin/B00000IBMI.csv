502434,A2NYK9KWFMJV4Y,B00000IBMI,"Mike Tarrani ""Jazz Drummer""","[0, 0]","The complaints regarding coherency and sequencing of this video as a documentary are valid, and if you are expecting a slick, professional biopic you will be disappointed.On the other hand, if you want to take a circuitous journey through Mingus' life and achievements, gleaning invaluable insights along the way, this video is not only a treasure, but a tribute to one of America's greatest composers.Do be warned that there is strong language throughout. Get past that and you will get who Mr. Mingus is in his own words, and the words of his friends, widow and ex wife, and fellow musicians. This is where the video is invaluable to those of us who are touched by his music.In my case I will admit that for decades I did not care for his music and pretty much ignored him. When I did start listening I discovered that his work is an acquired taste, and once acquired, is an addiction. That addiction is what inspired me to watch this movie repeatedly, and the path that I took getting here should warn you, the reader of this review, to take that into consideration if I get too enthusiastic in my opinions. That said, if you have an interest in jazz and how it evolved from the 1950s through to the end of the 1960s, then Charles Mingus is a key to understand that.  This film, in its disjointed, almost stream of conscious way, provides clues and informed opinions, but will not spoon feed you so-called facts the way, say, a Ken Burns documentary will.There was a single unifying theme that I picked up from this video and that was Sue Mingus' continuing and abiding love for Charles, and her tireless efforts to ensure that he receive the recognition as a composer that he richly deserves. That, however, is subjective. A more objective lesson I learned from the film was just how close Mingus and his drummer, the late, great Dannie Richmond were. As a drummer that was of considerable interest, and the film placed a lot of emphasis on that relationship, inspiring me to relisten to my favorite Mingus albums with a more critical ear directed to the rhythm section. I then spent hours listening and compared and contrasted the Mingus-Richmond unity to Mingus with Max Roach onMoney Jungle, something I may not have been inspired to do had I not watched this movie. The effort revealed just how connected Mingus and Richmond were musically, which, in turn, has caused me to expand my ideas on tempo, time and the subtle ways the rhythm section can add to the music.If you are a musician; specifically, a jazz musician, then you may get something from this movie in the way of inspiration or even an approach to the music itself. If you are a strong Charles Mingus fan, this is an essential biography that may be rough around the edges, but does expose Mingus as man and musical genius. Personally, I treasure my copy and watch it probably more than I should.

I always like the way people ignore the fact that some musical geniuses were plain out of their skulls. Through the years, a lot of jazz musicians (professional and non) paid (and continue to pay) homage to this guy, but would never be able to work for such a schizoid  personality.People let it slide all the weird things he did, and the way he treated other musicians in a sort of ""blind faith"" following. From what I've read in many books from musicians who've worked for him, and watching this video, it's almost as if they'd bow to him and lick his boots because they got notoriety from playing in his band (i.e. he may be abusive and obtuse, but man, I can make some money and be famous working for him).Then you get the snooty ""know-it-all's"" who worship him and look beyond his crass idiosyncrasies because they want to be part of the ""In Crowd"" in-the-know about this musical genius. But would never for a moment, want to possess his psychological profile, nor would they even consider socializing with this ""fruitcake"" if it were not for his music alone.He was an Underdog in his own mind, and brought upon his own paranoia due to his radical viewpoint towards life. Yeah, I like some of his music.

502436,A2FSHOTV0RNW7Q,B00000IBMI,"Steven Sprague ""Eklecticmovies.com""","[4, 5]","This documentary unapologetically has a mission: to elevate Charles Mingus' status to  ""great"" composer. Whether he is or is not can be argued, but when compared with the likes of Duke Ellington who was unquestionably a great composer, he might move down just a notch. A ""great"" bass player? Unquestionably. Herein lies my complaint: not enough focus on Mingus the bass player. That being said, this documentary makes it clear that Mingus and music are one. The most introspective moments come in the form of home movies of Mingus sitting at the piano composing. One scene in particular has him playing ""Goodbye Pork Pie Hat"" on an old upright to his daughter. Clearly this documentary was a work of love put together by those who revere his music and want to keep it alive.
