665189,A1YB29BIDULEYE,B00005MEP7,"Bradley Headstone ""Sean ARES Hirsch""","[0, 0]","If you follow my reviews, you know that I really liked ""Zombie Island"" and ""Witch's Ghost"" and ""Pirates Ahoy."" I felt ""Aloha Scooby Doo"" and ""Where's My Mummy"" were strong runner ups. I have some respect for ""Loch Ness Monster."" ""Alien Invasion"" and ""Monster of Mexico"" had their moments. Of all Scooby's movies, I like this one the least.Moving on, Scooby and the gang go to meet a friend at the university. After a somewhat tense moment with an uptight security guard, they meet their friend Eric, his friend Bill, and their professor. Eric and his friends at the school explain the existence of a phantom virus (that we already met). And we are told that someone must have created it. Many sparks of Scooby's former days are gone, and even the appetites of Scooby and Shaggy don't bring the laughs they once did.Well, Scooby and the gang get zapped into Eric's video game. While this may work for some, it doesn't work for me. (Perhaps I am too old school Scooby.) To be sure ""Zombie Island"" crossed the bounds of plausibility, but the difference is ZI, but the major difference is that ZI kept the story as plausible as possible for some time, and then gradually introduced the non plausible elements. It is often a challenge, but it can be done. (It just isn't in this 4th chapter.)On the plus side however, this enables the gang to go through a series of different adventures while we wonder who zapped them in. Sadly, another mistake is that it is SO OBVIOUS who zapped them in even on the 1st adventure. Call me a perfectionist, but they could have at least waited until the 2nd or 3rd level before they gave any clues. (Let alone an obvious one.) If we are willing to overlook this, we may find it interesting to see the gang go to the moon, Ancient Rome, etc.Eventually, they meet their cyber doubles (who look pretty much like their characters from the original episodes). They learn that they must defeat the phantom virus to exit the video game. I'll admit that it was nice to see some monsters from the past (including the Creeper and the Tar Monster). As we approach the end, it is somewhat anti climactic as even a fool would have known who created the virus.As I said, this movie is acceptable, but not great. Young children will probably like it, but the cutoff age may be surprisingly young. Thank goodness for better later efforts like ""Legend of the Vampire,"" ""Where's My Mummy?"" and ""Pirates Ahoy.""",3,"Acceptable, But Not Great",1152489600,"07 10, 2006",2006,2420,"['follow', 'reviews', 'know', 'really', 'liked', 'Zombie', 'Island', 'Witch', 'Ghost', 'Pirates', 'Ahoy', 'felt', 'Aloha', 'Scooby', 'Doo', 'Where', 'My', 'Mummy', 'were', 'strong', 'runner', 'ups', 'have', 'respect', 'Loch', 'Ness', 'Monster', 'Alien', 'Invasion', 'Monster', 'Mexico', 'had', 'moments', 'Scooby', 'movies', 'like', 'one', 'least.Moving', 'Scooby', 'gang', 'go', 'meet', 'friend', 'university', 'somewhat', 'tense', 'moment', 'uptight', 'security', 'guard', 'meet', 'friend', 'Eric', 'friend', 'Bill', 'professor', 'Eric', 'friends', 'school', 'explain', 'existence', 'phantom', 'virus', 'already', 'met', 'are', 'told', 'someone', 'must', 'have', 'created', 'Many', 'sparks', 'Scooby', 'former', 'days', 'are', 'gone', 'even', 'appetites', 'Scooby', 'Shaggy', 'do', ""n't"", 'bring', 'laughs', 'once', 'did.Well', 'Scooby', 'gang', 'get', 'zapped', 'Eric', 'video', 'game', 'may', 'work', ""n't"", 'work', 'Perhaps', 'am', 'too', 'old', 'school', 'Scooby', 'be', 'sure', 'Zombie', 'Island', 'crossed', 'bounds', 'plausibility', 'difference', 'ZI', 'major', 'difference', 'ZI', 'kept', 'story', 'as', 'plausible', 'possible', 'time', 'then', 'gradually', 'introduced', 'non', 'plausible', 'elements', 'often', 'challenge', 'can', 'be', 'done', 'just', ""n't"", '4th', 'chapter', 'plus', 'side', 'however', 'gang', 'go', 'series', 'different', 'adventures', 'wonder', 'who', 'zapped', 'Sadly', 'mistake', 'SO', 'OBVIOUS', 'who', 'zapped', 'even', '1st', 'adventure', 'Call', 'perfectionist', 'could', 'have', 'least', 'waited', '2nd', '3rd', 'level', 'gave', 'clues', 'Let', 'alone', 'obvious', 'one', 'are', 'willing', 'overlook', 'may', 'find', 'interesting', 'see', 'gang', 'go', 'moon', 'Ancient', 'Rome', 'etc.Eventually', 'meet', 'cyber', 'doubles', 'who', 'look', 'pretty', 'much', 'characters', 'original', 'episodes', 'learn', 'must', 'defeat', 'phantom', 'virus', 'exit', 'video', 'game', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'was', 'nice', 'see', 'monsters', 'past', 'including', 'Creeper', 'Tar', 'Monster', 'approach', 'end', 'somewhat', 'anti', 'climactic', 'even', 'fool', 'would', 'have', 'known', 'who', 'created', 'virus.As', 'said', 'movie', 'acceptable', 'not', 'great', 'Young', 'children', 'will', 'probably', 'cutoff', 'age', 'may', 'be', 'surprisingly', 'young', 'Thank', 'goodness', 'better', 'later', 'efforts', 'Legend', 'Vampire', 'Where', 'My', 'Mummy', 'Pirates', 'Ahoy']",N/A

The film is about Scooby and the gang going to visit a friend of there's that is creating a game based after their mysteries. After arriving there they find that a cyber ghost called the Phantom Virus is terrorizing the place so naturally they decide to try and catch him. The thing is, they get zapped into the computer game which some how can transfer real things in and out of it by using a gun looking thing. Once in the game they have to travel threw ten levels seeking Scooby snacks in each to go to the next. To be honest the idea is great but it was executed poorly, if it would have been done correctly it could have been as good as the Scooby shows I watched growing up. They even brought back some villains from the old classic episodes like the Creeper, so the potential was there.

It was really funny to see the characters more modernized in this, and what the retro counterparts looked like. The kids love it; they had asked to watch it twice this week. They can never get enough of Scooby, most of the DVDs related to this famous dog are close to being worn out.While this was a fun movie, the only complaint that I had about it was Shaggy's voice. I know it's not Casey Kasem, and it's too obvious. But once you get past that, it's not a problem. The other characters are voiced decently (they have had plenty of people voicing Velma and Daphne, but if they replaced Fred's voice, it would be a gaping hole--Frank Welker's voice is very key to the character). It's nice to know that some things don't change (like Fred being ""all-ego""). But the idea of seeing him sans-ascot was pretty gutsy (that ridiculous red ascot MADE Fred in the original series!). Scooby-Doo sounded the same, and he was just as love-able as ever (I never liked the cartoon much until I was the live-action film, but I ALWAYS loved Scooby!!!). Velma, however, is still my favorite character--she's smart, and sometimes has great one-liners. Daphne, for once, isn't the damsel-in-distress---she's resourceful and smarter than her cyber-counterpart. Fred was pretty cool, and Shaggy, as always, is a scene-stealer, but he's Shaggy--he doesn't need a reason.Other than that this was a decent film--plenty of laughs, and lots of adventure. If you like vintage Scooby-Doo, then this movie might peak your interest. The animation is great-and just as colorful as the original!

By now, anyone who knows a bit about this lovable hound and his mystery-solving human companions knows that they've faced many bad guys disguised as countless legendary ghosts, monsters, and ghouls, all while encountering the occasional real super-natural creature.  Though some might argue otherwise, this film perfectly combines both of these elements when someone creates a villainous computer virus that becomes a real-life threat to the gang.  On top of that, this flick was a nice tribute to the past, bringing back some classic Scooby-Doo enemies such as The Creeper.  But the best by far was when Scooby and the gang met Scooby and the gang.  That has to go down as one of the greatest moments in Scooby-Doo history!  Seriously, is there anything better than Scooby and Shaggy and Scooby and Shaggy chowing down together?  The only thing I wasn't a big fan of was when the film would cut back to the gang's friend, the other scientists, and the security guard watching the gang's progress in the cyber world and commenting on it.  It was as if they were simply saying ""We're still here, by the way.""  Also, the one scientist's comment about how the perpitrator behind the whole thing could very well be someone among them was so contrived.  It's obviously someone we've seen interacting with the gang already...that's how it works.  But for these minor faults, this is certainly my favorite of any Scooby-Doo films.

They also offered good misleads and made us nervous around the innocent characters, and made us completely relaxed (until the right time) around the characters who really were up to something. The clever humor in &quot;Scooby Doo Meets the Boo Brothers&quot; was non stop and the story did show some well thought out writing. Sadly, I can not say &quot;Scooby Doo and the Cyber Chase&quot; is one of Scooby's better movies. This movie gvae me the impression that it was simply made to make money. It really does not have the strong writing, chilling surprises, memorable soundtrack, or horror of &quot;Zombie Island&quot; or &quot;The Witch's Ghost.&quot; Nor does it offer the non stop laughs of the &quot;Boo Brothers.&quot; The whole situation is simply too implausible which immediately removes much potential horror. (Now to be sure &quot;Zombie Island&quot; and &quot;The Witch's Ghost&quot; passed the line of plausibility at times. But they had enough elements of reality for us to accept the events past plausibility.) With &quot;Zombie Island&quot; and &quot;The Witch's Ghost,&quot; I really thought Scooby Doo was jumping to new levels of excitement and terror. Now, it seems that he is regressing back to previous levels. But then &quot;Scooby Doo and the Cyber Chase&quot; is not all bad either. It may be somewhat of a drawn out episode, but it does have its good points. Some animation is well done; there are some interesting moments in their dangerous game; and the final round of their  game does have some memorable moments. It is also interesting to see how the members of the Scooby Gang would react to themselves. (Some originality is offered here. Alright.) This is certainly not a bad movie.
