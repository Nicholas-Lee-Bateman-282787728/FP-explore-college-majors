849131,A3TY1B54GNRM1B,B0002XL20C,"B. Newby ""spikescreed""","[1, 1]","Normally I sit on a product I plan to review, give it time to sink in so I can assess it fairly. In this case, I just hit stop on the DVD and now I need to vent my frustrations.This movie promised an interesting approach to the history of Vlad Dracula (not Dracul as most people say, Dracul was his father). I bought it (mercifully for pennies) on that promise, the presence of Brad Douriff and Billy Zane, and some fair reviews I had read about it. Sadly, it failed on every count. Feeling very much like the slew of nonsense that presently exudes from the once-great Full Moon Pictures (but without any of the campiness that keeps FMP mildly interesting), this movie is a cumbersome hodge-podge of dreadful acting, dreadfully trite dialogue that probably sounded poetic in the writer's head, and a plot so confusing and plodding that I was barely able to keep my attention on this movie.First of all, this movie starts off with a fairly accurate (albeit brief) account of Dracula's rise to power, and sets this story up in a very &#34;DaVinci Code&#34; sort of way. There is a secret order looking for an artifact of Dracula's and some student has it and they try to keep track of her to get it back. Only there seems to be warring factions, or perhaps a whole other secret group, also looking for the relic and they have a couple pointless battles with a less-than-enthusiastic Billy Zane. Douriff tries to approach his 3 minutes of screen time as the stately overseer of the good guys, but comes across as someone trying to get through his scenes so he can collect the $50 they promised him for this cameo.Then, the relic, an amulet, turns out to have magic powers that, at first, only cause nightmares and historically accurate flashbacks for the main characters (whoever they were...soooo forgetable), but then it inexplicably can open a portal through space and time but only for a random blonde chick and Dracula himself. Later, some priest shows up (from where, I have no clue) and he exhibits magical powers for about 5 seconds (why, I don't know) and then Dracula offs him and we move on. As you can tell, this film completely lost me by the end.Dracula himself might have been an okay b-film character if the writer could have picked a version to stick with. Is he an historical figure? Is he a vampire? Is he someone who just travelled through time but somehow is now a living corpse with super-powers and a randomly shape-shifting face? I couldn't tell you. It made no sense how the time portal brought the blonde girl through time without changing her at all, but Dracula (supposedly a regular person from history) is now described as having &#34;elastic, cold skin&#34; or something like that and he is a monster. Are they saying Dracula was really a monster? This brings up another problem I had which is that one of the 4 main characters is supposedly a Transylvanian local but is perfectly fine with the whole Dracula-is-a-vampire thing, which goes against everything about Romanian culture. They don't actually buy into the vampire stuff, though they will sell it to tourists (and bad filmmakers, clearly).Too many things were attempted with this movie and none of them worked. The characters react to the sudden appearance of monsters and time travelers as if these were totally acceptable changes to their lives. They have an initial look of shock and then they just continue on as if nothing weird just happened. I suppose we, the viewers, are supposed to have the same tacit acceptance of this plot. Personally, I can't do that. My willing suspension of disbelief only goes so far.Finally, a couple notes about the DVD itself. It looks great on the outside, but the menus are clearly bottom-budget templates. The aspect ratio claims to be widescreen, but it only fills a widescreen tv if you zoom into it. Otherwise, the picture has black bars on all four sides of the frame. I found that unacceptable. Zooming makes the picture blurry and dull, even on an upscaling player and HD display.I have never done this before, but I threw my copy in the trash the second I pulled it from my player. I'll consider the financial loss a stupidity tax for my blind purchase of such a dreadul movie.",1,A complete waste of time,1371427200,"06 17, 2013",2013,4211,"['Normally', 'sit', 'product', 'plan', 'review', 'give', 'time', 'sink', 'so', 'can', 'assess', 'fairly', 'case', 'just', 'hit', 'stop', 'DVD', 'now', 'need', 'vent', 'frustrations.This', 'movie', 'promised', 'interesting', 'approach', 'history', 'Vlad', 'Dracula', 'not', 'Dracul', 'most', 'people', 'say', 'Dracul', 'was', 'father', 'bought', 'mercifully', 'pennies', 'promise', 'presence', 'Brad', 'Douriff', 'Billy', 'Zane', 'fair', 'reviews', 'had', 'read', 'Sadly', 'failed', 'count', 'Feeling', 'very', 'much', 'slew', 'nonsense', 'presently', 'once-great', 'Full', 'Moon', 'Pictures', 'campiness', 'FMP', 'mildly', 'interesting', 'movie', 'cumbersome', 'hodge-podge', 'dreadful', 'acting', 'dreadfully', 'trite', 'dialogue', 'probably', 'sounded', 'poetic', 'writer', 'head', 'plot', 'confusing', 'plodding', 'was', 'barely', 'able', 'keep', 'attention', 'movie.First', 'movie', 'fairly', 'accurate', 'brief', 'account', 'Dracula', 'rise', 'power', 'story', 'up', 'very', '34', 'DaVinci', 'Code', '34', 'sort', 'way', 'secret', 'order', 'looking', 'artifact', 'Dracula', 'student', 'try', 'keep', 'track', 'get', 'back', 'Only', 'there', 'be', 'warring', 'factions', 'perhaps', 'whole', 'other', 'secret', 'group', 'also', 'looking', 'relic', 'have', 'couple', 'pointless', 'battles', 'less-than-enthusiastic', 'Billy', 'Zane', 'Douriff', 'approach', '3', 'minutes', 'screen', 'time', 'stately', 'overseer', 'good', 'guys', 'across', 'someone', 'trying', 'get', 'scenes', 'can', 'collect', '50', 'promised', 'cameo.Then', 'relic', 'amulet', 'out', 'have', 'magic', 'powers', 'first', 'only', 'cause', 'nightmares', 'historically', 'accurate', 'flashbacks', 'main', 'characters', 'were', 'soooo', 'forgetable', 'then', 'inexplicably', 'can', 'open', 'portal', 'space', 'time', 'only', 'random', 'blonde', 'chick', 'Dracula', 'Later', 'priest', 'up', 'where', 'have', 'clue', 'magical', 'powers', 'about', '5', 'seconds', 'why', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'then', 'Dracula', 'move', 'can', 'tell', 'film', 'completely', 'lost', 'end.Dracula', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'okay', 'b-film', 'character', 'writer', 'could', 'have', 'picked', 'version', 'stick', 'historical', 'figure', 'vampire', 'someone', 'who', 'just', 'travelled', 'time', 'somehow', 'now', 'living', 'corpse', 'super-powers', 'randomly', 'shape-shifting', 'face', 'could', ""n't"", 'tell', 'made', 'sense', 'how', 'time', 'portal', 'brought', 'blonde', 'girl', 'time', 'changing', 'Dracula', 'supposedly', 'regular', 'person', 'history', 'now', 'described', 'having', '34', 'elastic', 'cold', 'skin', '34', 'something', 'monster', 'Are', 'saying', 'Dracula', 'was', 'really', 'monster', 'up', 'problem', 'had', 'one', '4', 'main', 'characters', 'supposedly', 'Transylvanian', 'local', 'perfectly', 'fine', 'whole', 'Dracula-is-a-vampire', 'thing', 'everything', 'Romanian', 'culture', 'do', ""n't"", 'actually', 'buy', 'vampire', 'stuff', 'will', 'sell', 'tourists', 'bad', 'filmmakers', 'clearly', '.Too', 'many', 'things', 'were', 'attempted', 'movie', 'none', 'worked', 'characters', 'react', 'sudden', 'appearance', 'monsters', 'time', 'travelers', 'were', 'totally', 'acceptable', 'changes', 'lives', 'have', 'initial', 'look', 'shock', 'then', 'just', 'continue', 'nothing', 'weird', 'just', 'happened', 'suppose', 'viewers', 'are', 'supposed', 'have', 'same', 'tacit', 'acceptance', 'plot', 'Personally', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'willing', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'only', 'so', 'far.Finally', 'couple', 'DVD', 'great', 'outside', 'menus', 'are', 'clearly', 'bottom-budget', 'templates', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'claims', 'be', 'widescreen', 'only', 'widescreen', 'tv', 'zoom', 'Otherwise', 'picture', 'black', 'bars', 'four', 'sides', 'frame', 'found', 'unacceptable', 'Zooming', 'picture', 'blurry', 'dull', 'even', 'upscaling', 'player', 'HD', 'display.I', 'have', 'never', 'done', 'threw', 'copy', 'trash', 'second', 'pulled', 'player', ""'ll"", 'consider', 'financial', 'loss', 'stupidity', 'tax', 'blind', 'purchase', 'dreadul', 'movie']",Vlad

It is a necklace, and for some obscure and inexplicable reason it needs to be dipped into the bottom of a tiny bubbling waterfall that - again - for some obscure and inexplicable reason is in the tomb itself. Though you're in Dracula's tomb, he's not dead. Well, of course he is dead, but not ""dead-dead"". He's quite animate, and he's in the tomb with you, trying to keep you from dipping the necklace in the bubbling pond and then placing it on a rock. Yes - that's right. Dip the necklace in the pond and place it on a rock. That's what you need to do to kill him.Absurd enough, correct?Now imagine that the necklace is knocked out of your hands, and while your friends are keeping Dracula at bay (actually, just your boyfriend, everyone else is kind of looking around) you scramble for the necklace. One of your friends, who has been tainted by Dracula, jumps on you to keep you from getting to the necklace. Another friend, who - inexplicably - has been brought forward from the past into this period (and who performs no particular function whatsoever, other than perhaps to illustrate a rather foolish time concept - which is simply that time is nothing...uh, duh?), jumps on the tainted one and pulls her off. You grab the necklace, and while you're doing this, the tainted one, instead of continuing to assail you, holds on to the forward-in-time friend and watches you with the silly look that vampires have. The tongue lolling, wide-eyed mien that says to all: ""I'm a blood thirsty fool without a brain of my own. Without my leader, I would be lost."" What a sorry lot vampires are.So now you have the necklace! This is magnificent! Now you can dip the necklace in the bubbly water, lay it on the stone, and kill Dracula!But wait! Dracula is still in the room. If the tainted one won't help him, surely he will help himself?Given what I've said already, I think that's a question with an easy answer.While I'm leaving out the very end of the film, a sequence that should have caused tender emotion but instead caused me to laugh, this is the climax.

I'd only suggest renting this film to see Zane's performance....other than that, I think most people will be disappointed in the overall film.",2,Vlad.....,1141603200,"03 6, 2006",2006,493,"['OK', 'almost', 'give', '2', 'star', 'rating', 'BILLY', 'ZANE', 'movie', 'Zane', 'Great', 'performance', 'film', 'great', 'job', 'Romanian', 'accent', 'reason', '2', 'star', 'rating', 'Zane', 'was', 'only', 'reason', 'have', 'movie', 'Otherwise', 'moving', 'rather', 'boring', 'dracula', 'want', 'be', 'flick', 'Not', 'true', 'vampire', 'movie', ""'d"", 'only', 'suggest', 'renting', 'film', 'see', 'Zane', 'performance', '.other', 'think', 'most', 'people', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed', 'overall', 'film']",Vlad

The beginning, in Romanian with English subtitles is especially good.  Has a good cast of well-knowns...Billy Zane, Brad Dourif, etc.  The second film I've seen Francisco Quinn in and am wondering now why there haven't more.  An entertaining and slightly off-beat tale of the man who became Dracula.",4,More Historical Detail,1308787200,"06 23, 2011",2011,437,"['was', 'DVD', ""'d"", 'seen', 'before', 'wanted', 'own', 'copy', 'bit', 'different', 'story', 'Vlad', 'Impaler', 'more', 'historical', 'detail', 'beginning', 'Romanian', 'English', 'subtitles', 'especially', 'good', 'good', 'cast', 'well-knowns', 'Billy', 'Zane', 'Brad', 'Dourif', 'etc', 'second', 'film', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Francisco', 'Quinn', 'am', 'wondering', 'now', 'why', 'have', ""n't"", 'more', 'entertaining', 'slightly', 'off-beat', 'tale', 'man', 'who', 'became', 'Dracula']",Vlad
849144,A38QEATH3NODFM,B0002XL20C,Wiseguy 945,"[9, 9]","This was a very interesting movie about Vlad Dracula, not especially about vampires.  It tried to tell a bit of history about Vlad and his origin and rise to power, and it wasn't just a cheaply made movie to show off a bunch of women getting naked and getting their necks bitten. It's actually about 4 exchange student ""chosen"" to come to Romania to study the history of the country by traveling to the Carpatian mountains to research the home Territory of Vlad the Impailer.  But, one of them has a secret, an necklace that was worn by Vlad himself, taken off of him in his grave.  Now, the movie gets strange because it is not based around getting the necklace back, but about getting this midevil English girl that has been brought through time just before Vlad was going to Kill her (or marry her, not really sure).  She was warped through time by the power of the amulet.  After she comes back, so Follows Vlad because she reminds him of his dead wife.  The rest of the movie is the students trying to get this necklace back to the tomb so VLad will rest in peace.I could explain more, but Its difficult.  I found myself at many points wonder, why doesn't Vlad just take the dang english girl and leave, he wanders into the castle right by her (followed her scent) and attacks all the friend, and yet doesn't just walk up, take the girl and leave?.  Or, if he's mad about the Necklace, why doesn't he just take it from the guy?  I am not sure. Finally, as one of the other astute reviewer notes, at the end scene, One of the female student who is controlled by Vlad, attacks the friend attempting to put the necklace in the stream and back on the stone, then turns her attention to english girl who jumps on her back.  Finally, this Vlad controlled student gets the upper hand on the English chick, and calmly stand by in awe as the first friend completes the task of replaceing the necklace.  Why doesn't she snap the english gals neck and stop the gal with the necklace, or why doesn't vlad turn and stop her? Instead he is just merely swinging his sword attempting to kill the friend without the amulet?  Just really confusing. The movie was entertaining enough, but could have been so much more.  It just Kinda flaked out at the end.  Again, at times i think they did throw in some nudity scenes just to capture male viewership. Their was a dream scene in the bathtub, could have been done in bed or any other time just as well, but eh, that's what B movies do. Also, they had to throw in a steaming animalistic love scene, again, B movie nescessity?  So, worth seeing, just try and ignore the few script errors, and it really could have been a big film if it had been funded better.",3,"Not the worst Vampire movie, but Different",1154044800,"07 28, 2006",2006,2692,"['was', 'very', 'interesting', 'movie', 'Vlad', 'Dracula', 'not', 'especially', 'vampires', 'tried', 'tell', 'bit', 'history', 'Vlad', 'origin', 'rise', 'power', 'was', ""n't"", 'just', 'cheaply', 'made', 'movie', 'show', 'off', 'bunch', 'women', 'getting', 'naked', 'getting', 'necks', 'bitten', 'actually', '4', 'exchange', 'student', 'chosen', 'come', 'Romania', 'study', 'history', 'country', 'traveling', 'Carpatian', 'mountains', 'research', 'home', 'Territory', 'Vlad', 'Impailer', 'one', 'secret', 'necklace', 'was', 'worn', 'Vlad', 'taken', 'grave', 'Now', 'movie', 'strange', 'not', 'based', 'getting', 'necklace', 'back', 'getting', 'midevil', 'English', 'girl', 'been', 'brought', 'time', 'just', 'before', 'Vlad', 'was', 'going', 'Kill', 'marry', 'not', 'really', 'sure', 'was', 'warped', 'time', 'power', 'amulet', 'back', 'Follows', 'Vlad', 'dead', 'wife', 'rest', 'movie', 'students', 'trying', 'get', 'necklace', 'back', 'tomb', 'so', 'VLad', 'will', 'rest', 'peace.I', 'could', 'explain', 'more', 'difficult', 'found', 'many', 'points', 'wonder', 'why', ""n't"", 'Vlad', 'just', 'take', 'dang', 'english', 'girl', 'leave', 'castle', 'right', 'followed', 'scent', 'friend', 'yet', ""n't"", 'just', 'walk', 'up', 'take', 'girl', 'leave', 'mad', 'Necklace', 'why', ""n't"", 'just', 'take', 'guy', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'Finally', 'one', 'other', 'astute', 'reviewer', 'notes', 'end', 'scene', 'One', 'female', 'student', 'who', 'controlled', 'Vlad', 'friend', 'attempting', 'put', 'necklace', 'stream', 'back', 'stone', 'then', 'attention', 'english', 'girl', 'who', 'back', 'Finally', 'Vlad', 'controlled', 'student', 'upper', 'hand', 'English', 'chick', 'calmly', 'stand', 'awe', 'first', 'friend', 'task', 'replaceing', 'necklace', 'Why', ""n't"", 'snap', 'english', 'gals', 'neck', 'stop', 'gal', 'necklace', 'why', ""n't"", 'vlad', 'turn', 'stop', 'Instead', 'just', 'merely', 'swinging', 'sword', 'attempting', 'kill', 'friend', 'amulet', 'Just', 'really', 'confusing', 'movie', 'was', 'entertaining', 'enough', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'just', 'Kinda', 'flaked', 'out', 'end', 'Again', 'times', 'i', 'think', 'did', 'throw', 'nudity', 'scenes', 'just', 'capture', 'male', 'viewership', 'Their', 'was', 'dream', 'scene', 'bathtub', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'bed', 'other', 'time', 'just', 'as', 'well', 'eh', 'what', 'B', 'movies', 'do', 'Also', 'had', 'throw', 'steaming', 'animalistic', 'love', 'scene', 'again', 'B', 'movie', 'nescessity', 'So', 'worth', 'seeing', 'just', 'try', 'ignore', 'few', 'script', 'errors', 'really', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'big', 'film', 'had', 'been', 'funded', 'better']",Vlad
