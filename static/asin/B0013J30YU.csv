In addition to this if he's succesful he'll be featured on Oprah and become the next Deepak Chopra, his rival from guru school.Mike is actually pretty funny.

1142658,AKT39LK1YS658,B0013J30YU,A. marrero,"[1, 2]","First of all let me begin by saying that if I were a fan of Comedies I would have given this a four, but comedies because of their lack of realism are not my forte.That being said, after viewing the average that this movie has (on Amazon) I was afraid to watch. I watched it however, because the cast seemed stellar enough.After having watched the film I can honestly say that it was ammusing. There were parts that were meant to be funny and didn't do the trick and the unrealism found in most comedies was rampant but it was done in a very silly manner and the writing was sharp- atleast the way dialoque was used in order to get a smile (sorry not big on comedies) out of people. The acting was also quite good and some of the characters are flatline enough to be believable.However, I don't think that this film is appropriate for a 13 year old. It is rated PG13 but I wouldn't show it to anyone under 15 and I think it would actually be appropriate for 16+. Some of the jokes have a tad too much perversion and I think that it will take an older crowd to understand them and more importantly understand the gist of it which is to ammuse and possibly shock but not to represent anything in particular.All in all I would say that it was an hour in a half well spent.Also, after reading some of the reviews it seems that most people are not impressed by it because of what they expect from Mike Myers. I honestly, don't expect anything in particular from him as I don't, as already mentioned, really have an interest in comedy or comedians. All I can say is that I would spend the time and the couple of dollars to watch a movie like this again.

I'm writing my review in honor of the many Razzies that the film was recently nominated for.Mike Myers has been a part of some great comedies over the last two decades from Waynes World, to Austin Powers to Shrek. Mike Myers can't be funny playing himself, or at least hasn't really tried to in film. He is great, however, at creating characters. At least until the Love Guru came along.The Guru Pitka is a horrible character that is horribly played by Mike Myers. First, the Guru is a satire on Deepok Chopra I guess. Deepok Chopra is an extremely obscure pop culture reference to make an entire movie about. Second, as I watched the film, I could easily pick out the parts that were supposed to be funny or inspired, but the were instead painful and sad. Myers looks pathetic as the Guru Pitka, and it is even more saddening to watch the joy and zest with which he gave the character. Myers for some reason thought America would enjoy this character.If you do decide to watch this movie, you will wonder what movie executive thought this film should be released in the summer. This movie is historically bad. The only good part about the movie is the supporting cast with Romany Malco, Verne Troyer, Jessica Alba, Justin Timberlake and Ben Kingsley.Avoid the temptation to watch this movie.

1142668,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B0013J30YU,Chris Pandolfi,"[11, 16]","Forget about Mike Myers for a minute. Let's begin with Ben Kingsley, the Oscar winning actor who actually appears in ""The Love Guru""; he plays a cross-eyed spiritual advisor from India, and his name is not a double entendre so much as it's a blatant sexual reference smushed into a single word. The sight of this man is hilarious, and yet I didn't want to laugh because I know that Kingsley has made so many better choices than this film. What possessed him to act in a film this unashamedly juvenile? Did he find the idea of nonstop [...] gags appealing? I might as well be asking myself the same questions, because in all honesty, ""The Love Guru"" often had me giggling like a six-year-old who heard his first dirty joke. But to call this movie a comedic masterpiece would be an insult to the very concept of comedy.The plot focuses on Pitka (Myers), an American-born, Indian-raised guru who was taught by Kingsley's character to become an expert in matters of love. How, I'm not entirely sure; he was forced to put on a metal chastity belt at the age of twelve, and there it would stay until he learned how to love himself above all others. Be that as it may, he's now a world-renowned spiritual advisor, guiding hundreds of followers with his bits of wisdom. He even attracts celebrities like Mariska Hargitay, and that's really interesting because her name doubles as his blessing for peace, love, and tranquility. But for all his fame and fortune, Pitka feels empty inside because he's only the second most famous guru. The first, of course, is Deepak Chopra. There is, however, a way for Pitka to increase his popularity: he must heal a troubled relationship between a Hockey player and his wife, who left him for another Hockey player. If Pitka can help them, he will be secured a guest spot on Oprah's show.This opportunity arises because of Jane Bullard (Jessica Alba), owner of the Toronto Maple Leafs; the team's star player, Darren Roanoke (Romany Malco), broke up with his wife, Prudence (Meagan Good), and as a result, his Hockey skills have been waning. This shouldn't be a problem for Pitka, who's always ready with a slew of sayings hidden within acronyms. Examples: GURU is short for Gee, You Are You, and BIBLE is short for Basic Instructions Before Leaving Earth. He also has published a number of self-help books with such inspiring titles as ""If You're Happy and You Know It, Think Again,"" and ""Does it Hurt When You Do That? Don't Do That."" He introduces himself to Darren by rolling in on a motorized pillow and telling him that his wife has forgiven him. Low and behold, Darren's practice shots improve dramatically; Pitka then understands that the key to Darren's success is about distraction, not merely about reconciling a feuding couple.Thus begins a strict regiment of spiritual guidance. Darren's first big obstacle is his wife's new boyfriend, a French-Canadian Hockey player named Jacque Grande (Justin Timberlake). His talent is huge, much like his ... well, let's just say that there's a reason this man is so fond of roosters. Darren's second obstacle is his mother (Telma Hopkins), whose loveable face hides an incredibly overbearing personality. If Pitka can convince him to face her, he might be able to overcome years of emotional scarring. This, in turn, will bring him one step closer to patching things up with Prudence.Intertwined with all of this is the relationship between Pitka and Jane, which steadily grows. Jane feels inadequate because of what she calls the Bullard Curse; the long and short of it is that everyone in the city blames her for the Maple Leafs' losing streak. As a result, men stay as far away from her as possible. I have a feeling the audience won't care about this subplot one bit--all anyone will notice are the film's back-to-back sexual innuendoes related to male genitalia. There are also a fair number of gags featuring the Maple Leafs' coach, an angry, foulmouthed dwarf played by Verne Troyer. You remember Verne Troyer as Mini Me from the ""Austin Powers"" sequels, don't you? The dwarf jokes in those films wore thin after a while. The same can be said in the case of ""The Love Guru."" Truth be told, every joke wears thin at a certain point.But I can't deny the fact that I laughed every now and then. Consider cameo appearances by Stephen Colbert and Jim Gaffigan as sports announcers--they add nothing meaningful to the story, yet their one-liners are so outlandish that I found myself smiling. I'm not exactly proud of myself for that. I know that there are much better comedies out there, ones that don't begin and end with musical numbers and feature two elephants having sex in a Hockey rink. Again, I turn my attention back to Ben Kingsley, who chose to play a cross-eyed Indian despite his accomplished career: Did that same guilty laughter haunt him as he read the script? Was he actually tempted by the idea of telling masturbation jokes to audiences of immature teenagers? Maybe so, because goodness knows I wasn't strong enough to completely resist it.

That's pretty much his schtick, because...what else does he have?  He's an aged hound relying on the same old tricks: speaking to the audience and winking from ""Wayne's World"", silly acronyms that spell out a vulgar word from ""Cat In The Hat"", midget jokes from ""Austin Powers"", men gettin' their testies smashed also from ""Austin Powers"", and sing-a-longs from popular hits...""Austin Powers"" as well; in fact, this movie is a step-backward regarding sing-a-longs since Myers only mockingly sang by lyrics instead of adding his own words.  ""Austin Powers"" also did the whole 'love' puns, but the movie was never funny for that; it was funny for Dr. Evil's crazy antics.  Reattempting familiar gags for this movie doesn't make them funny, they're just old.It's just as unfortunate, since the main character, Guru Pitka, has to carry the humor for the whole movie.  He's the exact opposite of a spiritual adviser, being a narcissistic and materialistic fool.  Despicable in obvious ways, and his childish teachings for so-called 'wisdom' is actually creepy, almost as creepy as the scenes where Myers's head in digitally-inserted in a child's body.  The side characters are a letdown; I didn't expect much from Jessica Alba who's role is metaphorically spreading her legs for the entire movie or Justin Timberlake existing for a schlong joke and a phony accent, but I'm disappointed in Romany Malco.  Malco has been a funny guy in ""40-Year-Old Virgin"" and the first few seasons of ""Weeds"", but he has no stellar material for his role.  His Canadian 'Tiger Woods of Hockey' character is a straight-forward object for Pitka to interact for screen-hogging gags.  Not even Stephen Colbert as a sadistic sports announcer could bring in the laughs; I was begging for him to make anyPhil Ken Sebbenquote.""The Love Guru"" is all about taking the easy way approach to comedy, and it felt flat on its Mukh.

While I like many of Mike Myers comedy instincts, I'm not keen on his saccharine observations on relationships and I just didn't think he could pull of a whole movie with ""Love"" as its explicit subject. I knew that the movie had bombed and that even many of his fans had panned this effort -- this both confirmed my thoughts that I wouldn't like the movie while strangely making me want to see what was bad enough to turn off fans and critics alike.What I didn't know, having not been interested enough to read any of the movie reviews, was that the major plot line of the movie had as one of its two backgrounds the game of hockey. While incidental to the theme of the movie, Myers and the production team lovingly recreated the game with just the right mix of reverence and irreverence. That is to say, both the grace and the not so graceful aspects of the sport are presented with equal fervor and humor. Contrast this with the one-sided adoration of musicians versus the cartoon bad guys in ""Wayne's World"" and I would argue that Myers writing skills have improved or were at least better inspired here.Similarly, while making fun of devotees of eastern inspired religions, the non-stop clever acronyms, double-entendres and sayings have enough truth and heart in them that you can appreciate the spirit in which they were created even while laughing at the silliness.Finally, the slapstick elements of the movie were (with the exception of the nose jokes, for whatever reason, I just don't go for pure gross-out jokes) often laugh out loud, or at least snicker worthy. The magic carpet, the smoke bombs, the barroom brawl ending up the macho contestants laughing at objects they were impaled with, ""mini-me"" as a hard boiled NHL coach who is at one point of the movie fired into the goal thereby waking up the scoring booth lamp lighter who had fallen asleep during an interminable break in the action, a ""bollywood"" dance number at the end... Nice subtle and not-so-subtle touches throughout.So what about the ""Love""? Did the Love Guru learn to love himself thereby freeing him to truly love others by the end of the movie? I found myself thankfully not caring about this, there was enough goodhearted intent to remove my usual skepticism regarding Myers' musings on relationships. Indeed, the overall goodnatured attitude of this movie was undoubtedly what attracted several major celebrities to participate. And if you're a fan of Stephen Colbert, you'll want to see his numerous scenes rambling on as a color commentator for the hockey TV broadcasts.In the end I'm really not sure why so many of Mike Myers fans reacted with such disappointment to this movie: maybe the background props involving hockey and eastern religion for so many of the jokes were not as popular as those in previous efforts? Certainly more people could relate to music jokes and parodies of James Bond cinema.... So I'm thinking if you have an interest in hockey AND eastern religions AND are a Mike Myers fan, check this movie out and you might be pleasantly surprised.",3,"The Love Story didn't matter, and that's a good thing",1246147200,"06 28, 2009",2009,3152,"['fully', 'expected', 'dislike', 'movie', 'case', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'bothered', 'write', 'like', 'many', 'Mike', 'Myers', 'comedy', 'instincts', ""'m"", 'not', 'keen', 'saccharine', 'observations', 'relationships', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'could', 'pull', 'whole', 'movie', 'Love', 'explicit', 'subject', 'knew', 'movie', 'had', 'bombed', 'even', 'many', 'fans', 'had', 'panned', 'effort', 'confirmed', 'thoughts', 'would', ""n't"", 'like', 'movie', 'strangely', 'making', 'want', 'see', 'what', 'was', 'bad', 'enough', 'turn', 'off', 'fans', 'critics', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'having', 'not', 'been', 'interested', 'enough', 'read', 'movie', 'reviews', 'was', 'major', 'plot', 'line', 'movie', 'had', 'one', 'two', 'game', 'hockey', 'incidental', 'theme', 'movie', 'Myers', 'production', 'team', 'lovingly', 'recreated', 'game', 'just', 'right', 'mix', 'reverence', 'irreverence', 'say', 'grace', 'not', 'so', 'graceful', 'aspects', 'sport', 'are', 'presented', 'equal', 'fervor', 'humor', 'Contrast', 'one-sided', 'adoration', 'musicians', 'versus', 'cartoon', 'bad', 'guys', 'Wayne', 'World', 'would', 'argue', 'Myers', 'writing', 'skills', 'have', 'improved', 'were', 'least', 'better', 'inspired', 'here.Similarly', 'making', 'fun', 'devotees', 'eastern', 'inspired', 'religions', 'non-stop', 'clever', 'acronyms', 'double-entendres', 'sayings', 'have', 'enough', 'truth', 'heart', 'can', 'appreciate', 'spirit', 'were', 'created', 'even', 'laughing', 'silliness.Finally', 'slapstick', 'elements', 'movie', 'were', 'exception', 'nose', 'jokes', 'reason', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'pure', 'gross-out', 'jokes', 'often', 'out', 'loud', 'least', 'snicker', 'worthy', 'magic', 'carpet', 'smoke', 'bombs', 'barroom', 'brawl', 'ending', 'up', 'macho', 'contestants', 'laughing', 'objects', 'were', 'impaled', 'mini-me', 'hard', 'boiled', 'NHL', 'coach', 'who', 'one', 'point', 'movie', 'fired', 'goal', 'thereby', 'waking', 'up', 'scoring', 'booth', 'lamp', 'lighter', 'who', 'had', 'fallen', 'asleep', 'interminable', 'break', 'action', 'bollywood', 'dance', 'number', 'end', 'Nice', 'subtle', 'not-so-subtle', 'touches', 'throughout.So', 'what', 'Love', 'Did', 'Love', 'Guru', 'learn', 'love', 'thereby', 'freeing', 'truly', 'love', 'others', 'end', 'movie', 'found', 'thankfully', 'not', 'caring', 'was', 'enough', 'goodhearted', 'intent', 'remove', 'usual', 'skepticism', 'regarding', 'Myers', 'musings', 'relationships', 'Indeed', 'overall', 'goodnatured', 'attitude', 'movie', 'was', 'undoubtedly', 'what', 'attracted', 'several', 'major', 'celebrities', 'participate', ""'re"", 'fan', 'Stephen', 'Colbert', ""'ll"", 'want', 'see', 'numerous', 'scenes', 'rambling', 'color', 'commentator', 'hockey', 'TV', 'broadcasts.In', 'end', ""'m"", 'really', 'not', 'sure', 'why', 'so', 'many', 'Mike', 'Myers', 'fans', 'reacted', 'such', 'disappointment', 'movie', 'maybe', 'background', 'involving', 'hockey', 'eastern', 'religion', 'so', 'many', 'jokes', 'were', 'not', 'as', 'popular', 'previous', 'efforts', 'Certainly', 'more', 'people', 'could', 'relate', 'music', 'jokes', 'parodies', 'James', 'Bond', 'cinema', ""'m"", 'thinking', 'have', 'interest', 'hockey', 'eastern', 'religions', 'are', 'Mike', 'Myers', 'fan', 'check', 'movie', 'might', 'be', 'pleasantly', 'surprised']",The Love Guru

Unfortunately, first-time director Marco Schnabel simply lets the star and the rest of the lackluster cast flounder without lending a perspective that could have balanced the lowbrow shenanigans with the highbrow aspirations. As unsatisfying as the film is, I wonder if Judd Apatow could have saved this material.The overextended plot revolves around self-help guru Maurice Pitka, who was born in America but raised in India. With his long hair and beard and traditional Hindu garb, Pitka is known as a second-rate Chopra, but he is aggressively looking for an opportunity to change that and get on the Oprah Winfrey Show. Enter Darren Roanoke, star player for the Toronto Maple Leafs, who goes into a scoring slump just as the team makes the Stanley Cup playoffs. Team owner Jane Bullard and coach Punch Cherkov seek out Pitka to help Roanoke reconcile with his wife Prudence, who has caused his beleaguered lack of self-esteem. She has decided to leave him for the conjugal joys to be had with Jacques ""Le Coq"" Grande, the goalie for the opposing Los Angeles Kings known for his elephantine endowment. Pitka espouses his radical ""DRAMA"" method of enlightenment to alleviate Roanoke's stress and lead him on a journey toward self-love. Apparently that's the only chance that the Maple Leafs have in winning the Cup. At the same time, Pitka realizes his goal to usurp Chopak is a hollow one when he becomes romantically drawn to the comely Bullard.Myers may have gone to the well one too many times with his smarmy, overly self-aware performance as Pitka. What goodwill he generated as Wayne Campbell and Austin Powers has almost evaporated here. As Bullard, Jessica Alba is a pretty but unavoidably wooden foil to Myers, and her character's attraction to Pitka remains one of the film's bigger mysteries. Somewhat better is Romany Malco as Roanoke and Justin Timberlake as Grande, though neither is imposing enough to be particularly believable as professional hockey players. As a more verbal version of Mini-Me, Verne Troyer plays Cherkov in constant foul-mouthed agitation. The most embarrassing performance, however, belongs to a cross-eyed Ben Kingsley as Pitka's spiritual mentor, Guru Tugginmypudha. I doubt if any other Oscar winner has taken quite as discreet a fall from grace. On the other hand, I have to admit I liked the sitar revamp of Dolly Parton's ""9 to 5"" as the irrelevant opening theme, as well as Stephen Colbert's funny bits with Jim Gaffigan as the play-by-play commentators. But that's about it.The extras are abundant on the 2008 DVD if you care to view them. First, there is a standard making-of featurette, ""Mike Myers and The Love Guru - An Inside Look"" that runs ten minutes with comments from Myers, Alba, Troyer, and Schnabel. There is a six-minute short, ""One Helluva Elephant"", showing how special effects specialist Ron Stefaniuk built an animatronic elephant and ostrich for the movie. More interesting is ""Hockey Training for Actors"" which has sports coordinator Mark Ellis explaining how the actors learned to play hockey. Rounding out the extras are eleven deleted/extended scenes, a four-minute blooper reel, a separate five-minute compilation of deleted takes with Colbert and Gaffigan (the best of the extras and even better than the movie), ten minutes more of general outtakes, and the original theatrical trailer.",2,Myers Flails as a Chopak Wannabe in a Comic Misfire,1224633600,"10 22, 2008",2008,4050,"['Star', 'co-writer', 'Mike', 'Myers', 'far', 'too', 'clever', 'be', 'dismissed', 'entirely', 'film', 'burdened', 'kitchen-sink', 'approach', 'comedy', 'However', '2008', 'film', 'closest', 'making', 'downright', 'intolerable', 'smattering', 'smart', 'one-liners', 'barely', 'save', 'landing', 'junk', 'bin', 'concept', 'would', 'seem', 'ripe', 'possibilities', 'film', 'commercial', 'intentions', 'self-help', 'gurus', 'Deepak', 'Chopra', 'Myers', 'writing', 'partner', 'Graham', 'Gordy', 'appear', 'more', 'interested', 'bodily', 'functions', 'gross-out', 'humor', 'repetitive', 'gags', 'Mariska', 'Hargitay', 'Canadian', 'in-jokes', 'celebrity', 'walk-ons', 'rather', 'keep', 'satirical', 'aspects', 'focused', 'enough', 'make', 'point', 'Unfortunately', 'first-time', 'director', 'Marco', 'Schnabel', 'simply', 'star', 'rest', 'lackluster', 'cast', 'flounder', 'lending', 'perspective', 'could', 'have', 'balanced', 'lowbrow', 'highbrow', 'aspirations', 'As', 'unsatisfying', 'film', 'wonder', 'Judd', 'Apatow', 'could', 'have', 'saved', 'material.The', 'overextended', 'plot', 'revolves', 'self-help', 'guru', 'Maurice', 'Pitka', 'who', 'was', 'born', 'America', 'raised', 'India', 'long', 'hair', 'beard', 'traditional', 'Hindu', 'garb', 'Pitka', 'known', 'second-rate', 'Chopra', 'aggressively', 'looking', 'opportunity', 'change', 'get', 'Oprah', 'Winfrey', 'Show', 'Enter', 'Darren', 'Roanoke', 'star', 'player', 'Toronto', 'Maple', 'Leafs', 'who', 'scoring', 'slump', 'just', 'team', 'Stanley', 'Cup', 'playoffs', 'Team', 'owner', 'Jane', 'Bullard', 'coach', 'Punch', 'Cherkov', 'seek', 'out', 'Pitka', 'help', 'Roanoke', 'reconcile', 'wife', 'Prudence', 'who', 'caused', 'beleaguered', 'lack', 'self-esteem', 'decided', 'leave', 'conjugal', 'joys', 'be', 'had', 'Jacques', 'Le', 'Coq', 'Grande', 'goalie', 'opposing', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'Kings', 'known', 'elephantine', 'endowment', 'Pitka', 'radical', 'DRAMA', 'method', 'enlightenment', 'alleviate', 'Roanoke', 'stress', 'lead', 'journey', 'self-love', 'Apparently', 'only', 'chance', 'Maple', 'Leafs', 'have', 'winning', 'Cup', 'same', 'time', 'Pitka', 'goal', 'usurp', 'Chopak', 'hollow', 'one', 'when', 'romantically', 'drawn', 'comely', 'Bullard.Myers', 'may', 'have', 'gone', 'well', 'one', 'too', 'many', 'times', 'smarmy', 'overly', 'self-aware', 'performance', 'Pitka', 'What', 'goodwill', 'generated', 'Wayne', 'Campbell', 'Austin', 'Powers', 'almost', 'evaporated', 'here', 'Bullard', 'Jessica', 'Alba', 'pretty', 'unavoidably', 'wooden', 'foil', 'Myers', 'character', 'attraction', 'Pitka', 'one', 'film', 'bigger', 'mysteries', 'Somewhat', 'better', 'Romany', 'Malco', 'Roanoke', 'Justin', 'Timberlake', 'Grande', 'imposing', 'enough', 'be', 'particularly', 'believable', 'professional', 'hockey', 'players', 'more', 'verbal', 'version', 'Mini-Me', 'Verne', 'Troyer', 'Cherkov', 'constant', 'foul-mouthed', 'agitation', 'most', 'embarrassing', 'performance', 'however', 'cross-eyed', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'Pitka', 'spiritual', 'mentor', 'Guru', 'Tugginmypudha', 'doubt', 'other', 'Oscar', 'winner', 'taken', 'quite', 'discreet', 'fall', 'grace', 'other', 'hand', 'have', 'admit', 'liked', 'sitar', 'revamp', 'Dolly', 'Parton', '9', '5', 'irrelevant', 'opening', 'theme', 'as', 'well', 'Stephen', 'Colbert', 'funny', 'bits', 'Jim', 'Gaffigan', 'play-by-play', 'commentators', 'it.The', 'extras', 'are', 'abundant', '2008', 'DVD', 'care', 'view', 'First', 'standard', 'making-of', 'featurette', 'Mike', 'Myers', 'Love', 'Guru', 'Inside', 'Look', 'ten', 'minutes', 'comments', 'Myers', 'Alba', 'Troyer', 'Schnabel', 'six-minute', 'short', 'One', 'Helluva', 'Elephant', 'showing', 'how', 'special', 'effects', 'specialist', 'Ron', 'Stefaniuk', 'built', 'animatronic', 'elephant', 'ostrich', 'movie', 'More', 'interesting', 'Hockey', 'Training', 'Actors', 'sports', 'coordinator', 'Mark', 'Ellis', 'explaining', 'how', 'actors', 'learned', 'play', 'hockey', 'Rounding', 'out', 'extras', 'are', 'eleven', 'deleted/extended', 'scenes', 'four-minute', 'blooper', 'reel', 'separate', 'five-minute', 'compilation', 'deleted', 'Colbert', 'Gaffigan', 'best', 'extras', 'even', 'better', 'movie', 'ten', 'minutes', 'more', 'general', 'outtakes', 'original', 'theatrical', 'trailer']",The Love Guru

1142681,A2BQBLCKJHP65G,B0013J30YU,"Eric Ericson ""RedSabbath""","[2, 4]","Poor Mike Myers. The guy has a talent for creating clueless catchy characters that all basically run on a fuel of catch-phrases, sight-gags, and pokes at then current points of pop-culture. And usually it works. Works well. From teenage Metal fans Wayne's World, to a stranger in a strange land Austin Powers, when it comes to original creations, Mike Myers really has done well for himself. But how far can you use the exact same template, just changing it's color each time before the format grows stale?Six years seems about right.Because it's been six years since the last Austin Powers film Goldmember, and now Myers is back with a brand new character Guru Pitka, a self-help spiritual advisor who's second only to real-life equivalent Deepak Chopra. When Pitka gets an offer to help the Tiger Woods of Hockey Darren Roanoke (the Chris Rock-lite Romany Malco) get out of his romantic funk after losing the love of his life, he himself finds the same in the team's owner, played curiously by Jessica Alba, who I figure she thought she was originally appearing in Austin Powers IV. Along the way, you get a variety of secondary cast members by the likes of Justin Timberlake (who steals the show as a Canadian well-endowed goalie who stole Roanoke's love), Stephen Colbert (doing his Report as if it was Sportscenter), Ben Kingsley (who has offically flushed his credibly down the toliet here as Pitka's crossed-eyed mentor), and ""please give me a job"" Verne Troyer.But what is painfully obvious literally minutes into this film is that all it really is, is a reworking of those Austin Powers movies. Instead of big glasses & funky teeth, it's a beard and big nose. Instead of an exaggerated British accent, it's an over-the-top Indian one. He even stoops to a few musical parodies in this too, sound painfully familiar? And when Powers had tons of humorous innunendo borderline-risque sight-gags, Guru follows suit, but feeling extremely forced and stale this time around. There are tons of word-play style jokes here that just scream ""Yeah, Baby!"" that will have your eyes rolling back into your head faster than you can say Linda Blair. And 80% of them you will see coming. This was just too expected of Myers to do after patenting that style of humor he's known for from way back in his SNL days. Granted, about 3/4 into the film the character might grow on you a little more, but even with a second viewing you'll still think half these jokes would have worked better out of the mouth of say Dr. Evil.The disc isn't too bad for extras with a documentary, outakes, deleted scenes, and a blooper reel (which looks like nobody on-set was really laughing all that hard to begin with), but this film won't sit next to Wayne's World or Austin Powers on your shelf without hiding behind it's fakey beard. Too much like a rehash of former greatness to be considered good on it's own, Mike Myers needs to find himself a writer that can present him in a whole new light without the crutch of body-part jokes and funny plastic faces to only carry him through.(RedSabbath Rating:6.0/10)",2,"Well, At Least The Elephants Were Funny....",1223251200,"10 6, 2008",2008,3082,"['Poor', 'Mike', 'Myers', 'guy', 'talent', 'creating', 'clueless', 'catchy', 'characters', 'basically', 'run', 'fuel', 'catch-phrases', 'sight-gags', 'pokes', 'then', 'current', 'points', 'pop-culture', 'usually', 'Works', 'well', 'teenage', 'Metal', 'fans', 'Wayne', 'World', 'stranger', 'strange', 'land', 'Austin', 'Powers', 'when', 'original', 'creations', 'Mike', 'Myers', 'really', 'done', 'well', 'how', 'far', 'can', 'use', 'exact', 'same', 'template', 'just', 'changing', 'color', 'time', 'format', 'stale', 'Six', 'years', 'right.Because', 'been', 'six', 'years', 'last', 'Austin', 'Powers', 'film', 'Goldmember', 'now', 'Myers', 'back', 'brand', 'new', 'character', 'Guru', 'Pitka', 'self-help', 'spiritual', 'advisor', 'who', 'second', 'only', 'real-life', 'equivalent', 'Deepak', 'Chopra', 'When', 'Pitka', 'offer', 'help', 'Tiger', 'Woods', 'Hockey', 'Darren', 'Roanoke', 'Chris', 'Rock-lite', 'Romany', 'Malco', 'get', 'romantic', 'funk', 'losing', 'love', 'life', 'same', 'team', 'owner', 'played', 'curiously', 'Jessica', 'Alba', 'who', 'figure', 'thought', 'was', 'originally', 'appearing', 'Austin', 'Powers', 'IV', 'way', 'get', 'variety', 'secondary', 'cast', 'members', 'likes', 'Justin', 'Timberlake', 'who', 'show', 'Canadian', 'well-endowed', 'goalie', 'who', 'stole', 'Roanoke', 'love', 'Stephen', 'Colbert', 'doing', 'Report', 'was', 'Sportscenter', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'who', 'offically', 'flushed', 'credibly', 'down', 'toliet', 'here', 'Pitka', 'crossed-eyed', 'mentor', 'please', 'give', 'job', 'Verne', 'Troyer.But', 'what', 'painfully', 'obvious', 'literally', 'minutes', 'film', 'really', 'reworking', 'Austin', 'Powers', 'movies', 'Instead', 'big', 'glasses', 'funky', 'teeth', 'beard', 'big', 'nose', 'Instead', 'exaggerated', 'British', 'accent', 'over-the-top', 'Indian', 'one', 'even', 'few', 'musical', 'parodies', 'too', 'sound', 'painfully', 'familiar', 'when', 'Powers', 'had', 'tons', 'humorous', 'innunendo', 'borderline-risque', 'sight-gags', 'Guru', 'suit', 'feeling', 'extremely', 'forced', 'stale', 'time', 'around', 'are', 'tons', 'word-play', 'style', 'jokes', 'here', 'just', 'scream', 'Yeah', 'Baby', 'will', 'have', 'eyes', 'rolling', 'back', 'head', 'faster', 'can', 'say', 'Linda', 'Blair', '80', '%', 'will', 'see', 'coming', 'was', 'just', 'too', 'expected', 'Myers', 'do', 'patenting', 'style', 'humor', 'known', 'way', 'back', 'SNL', 'days', 'Granted', 'about', '3/4', 'film', 'character', 'might', 'grow', 'little', 'more', 'even', 'second', 'viewing', ""'ll"", 'still', 'think', 'jokes', 'would', 'have', 'worked', 'better', 'mouth', 'say', 'Dr.', 'Evil.The', 'disc', ""n't"", 'too', 'bad', 'extras', 'documentary', 'outakes', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'blooper', 'reel', 'nobody', 'on-set', 'was', 'really', 'laughing', 'hard', 'begin', 'film', 'wo', ""n't"", 'sit', 'next', 'Wayne', 'World', 'Austin', 'Powers', 'shelf', 'hiding', 'fakey', 'beard', 'Too', 'much', 'rehash', 'former', 'greatness', 'be', 'considered', 'good', 'own', 'Mike', 'Myers', 'find', 'writer', 'can', 'present', 'whole', 'new', 'light', 'crutch', 'body-part', 'jokes', 'funny', 'plastic', 'only', 'carry', 'RedSabbath', 'Rating:6.0/10']",The Love Guru

But then, we'll come back to this a little later.He has nightmares about being the second-best Guru in the business, always behind the eponymous Deepak Chopra. To become numero uno, he must prove he is good enough by re-uniting an estranged hockey player with his wife, which would win him an invitation from Oprah, which, in turn, would make him No. 1.The plot is not funny, and largely, neither is the cast. But I have to admit I couldn't keep from laughing my a** off on more than one ocassion. Myers' speciality is to shock you and force you to break into a laughter, a stunt which the Guru Pitka also pulls many times during the movie, and succeeds quite often in.The sillyness index is quite high, but if you have time on your hand and have a chance to see this flick, you might actually give it a second thought.Cameo appearances by Jessica Simpson, Val Kilmer, Mariska Hargitay (Det. Olivia Benson on Law & Order: SVU), and Deepak Chopra fill the gaps in the movie.Uh, and yes, about that remark ""love yourself, above all else"" makes sense when Chopra meets Guru P. and says ""You are free"", to which the GP replies, ""I'm no longer the next Deepak Chopra, I'm the first Guru Pitka"".Peppered by such quips intermittently, and a laugh here-and-there, the movie was enough to make me watch it full and not discard it simply because so many people did.Not bad, I'd say.",3,"Not a Guru, but not entirely trash either!",1217030400,"07 26, 2008",2008,2152,"['onset', 'let', 'agree', 'whole-heartedly', 'Mike', 'Meyers', 'done', 'much', 'better', 'work', 'past', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'counted', 'best.But', 'not', 'as', 'bad', 'everyone', 'apt', 'point', 'out.Agreed', 'humor', 'mostly', 'bad', 'full', 'genitalia', 'jokes', 'really', 'bad', 'taste', 'sequences', 'look', 'out', 'mop-fight', 'would', ""n't"", 'just', 'trash', 'movie', 'yet.Myers', 'plays', 'Indian', 'Love', 'Guru', 'anyone', 'said', 'Peter', 'Sellers', 'Party', 'named', 'Guru', 'Pitka', 'taught', 'squint-eyed', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'why', 'more', 'importantly', 'how', 'spread', 'message', 'peace', 'love', 'world', 'bound', 'vow', 'read', 'chastity', 'belt', 'such', 'time', 'love', 'last', 'part', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'yes', 'even', 'more', 'other', 'stuff', 'then', ""'ll"", 'come', 'back', 'little', 'later.He', 'nightmares', 'being', 'second-best', 'Guru', 'business', 'always', 'eponymous', 'Deepak', 'Chopra', 'become', 'numero', 'uno', 'must', 'prove', 'good', 'enough', 're-uniting', 'estranged', 'hockey', 'player', 'wife', 'would', 'win', 'invitation', 'Oprah', 'turn', 'would', 'make', 'No', '1.The', 'plot', 'not', 'funny', 'largely', 'cast', 'have', 'admit', 'could', ""n't"", 'keep', 'laughing', 'a**', 'more', 'one', 'ocassion', 'Myers', 'speciality', 'shock', 'force', 'break', 'laughter', 'stunt', 'Guru', 'Pitka', 'also', 'many', 'times', 'movie', 'quite', 'often', 'in.The', 'sillyness', 'index', 'quite', 'high', 'have', 'time', 'hand', 'have', 'chance', 'see', 'flick', 'might', 'actually', 'give', 'second', 'thought.Cameo', 'appearances', 'Jessica', 'Simpson', 'Val', 'Kilmer', 'Mariska', 'Hargitay', 'Det', 'Olivia', 'Benson', 'Law', 'Order', 'SVU', 'Deepak', 'Chopra', 'fill', 'gaps', 'movie.Uh', 'yes', 'remark', 'love', 'else', 'sense', 'when', 'Chopra', 'Guru', 'P.', 'are', 'free', 'GP', 'replies', ""'m"", 'no', 'longer', 'next', 'Deepak', 'Chopra', ""'m"", 'first', 'Guru', 'Pitka', '.Peppered', 'such', 'quips', 'intermittently', 'laugh', 'here-and-there', 'movie', 'was', 'enough', 'make', 'watch', 'full', 'not', 'discard', 'simply', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'did.Not', 'bad', ""'d"", 'say']",The Love Guru

All the bad press it received made me nervous.Maybe it was that my expectations were pretty low then, but I loved The Love Guru! I don't know why it got slammed. Watching the movie, it didn't feel like a flop to me. If you liked hisAustin Powersmovies, you would like this one as well. It is not quite up to the level he hit withThe Spy Who Shagged Me, but is better thanGoldmember.I honestly don't understand the complaints of juvenile humor. Of course it is juvenile. So wereAnchorman,The Naked Gun,Step BrothersandSuperbad. Juvenile humor is what America loves and it was done well here.I also liked the slams of self help gurus and the way that it shows just how empty and useless a lot of their advice is. (Guru Pitka endlessly self promotes books with names like 'I know you are, but what am I?' and has goofy sayings like 'I speak of Intimacy, or Into-Me-I-See, TM."")

I like smart comedy, stuff that makes me laugh at more than seeing two elephants, um, copulating.In recent years I've read all sorts of reviews that try to find more depth in a movie than it, on the surface, even proclaims to offer.The Love Guru, for as silly as it is, had me laughing through about 90%.  Admittedly I'm biased toward all things Indian (and this didn't quite stand up to 2003 The Guru), but it showed the writer's paid due attention to the things they were parodying.  Plus, the issues they addressed (infidelity, self-help, work stress, etc.) are ones that can speak to a wide swath of people.  Sometimes reaching the widest target audience with politically driven comedies misses the mark (in my mind I refer to You Don't Mess With the Zohan).Sure this movie has had a luke-warm response by many (the trusted Week magazine shamefully gave it a one-star..blech), but I think anyone who watches this film and expects any more than a good time with some fun Mike Myers past references, is bound to be disappointed.Heck, I had to watch Dumb and Dumber 6 times before it made me laugh.  It's all about letting your mind open up.As for The Love Guru cast, all had their high points:Mike Meyers: Funny and goofy as ever.  I laughed most when he got the bathroom scribbling joke and when he sang More Than Words...the latter due primarily to his get-up.Justin Timberlake: Why do people scoff so? I don't know much about the Qu&eacute;b&eacute;cois, but I imagine that Timberlake portrayed a fine parody of one.Jessica Alba: Her character fit the least well, but she stood on her own.  A good sport for doing things Bollywood style.Ben Kingsley: from Gandhi to Guru Tugginmypudha, what more shall I say?Verne Troyer:  Not that this man wasn't funny before, but I really liked his bad-a** attitude as the Coach.Overall, the names were silly (if you don't catch their meaning phonetically, then read them some where), the jokes were constant, the meaning was superficial, but it was all around a very good time.",4,"Jai Guru Pitka, Om...Thanks for the laughs",1214784000,"06 30, 2008",2008,2077,"[""'m"", 'usually', 'quite', 'tepid', 'comedy', 'films', 'kind', 'smart', 'comedy', 'stuff', 'laugh', 'more', 'seeing', 'two', 'elephants', 'um', 'copulating.In', 'recent', 'years', ""'ve"", 'read', 'sorts', 'reviews', 'try', 'find', 'more', 'depth', 'movie', 'surface', 'even', 'offer.The', 'Love', 'Guru', 'as', 'silly', 'had', 'laughing', 'about', '90', '%', 'Admittedly', ""'m"", 'biased', 'things', 'Indian', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'stand', 'up', '2003', 'Guru', 'showed', 'writer', 'paid', 'due', 'attention', 'things', 'were', 'parodying', 'issues', 'addressed', 'infidelity', 'self-help', 'work', 'stress', 'etc', 'are', 'ones', 'can', 'speak', 'wide', 'swath', 'people', 'Sometimes', 'reaching', 'widest', 'target', 'audience', 'politically', 'driven', 'comedies', 'mark', 'mind', 'refer', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Mess', 'Zohan', '.Sure', 'movie', 'had', 'luke-warm', 'response', 'many', 'trusted', 'Week', 'magazine', 'shamefully', 'gave', 'one-star..blech', 'think', 'anyone', 'who', 'film', 'more', 'good', 'time', 'fun', 'Mike', 'Myers', 'past', 'references', 'bound', 'be', 'disappointed.Heck', 'had', 'watch', 'Dumb', 'Dumber', '6', 'times', 'made', 'letting', 'mind', 'open', 'up.As', 'Love', 'Guru', 'cast', 'had', 'high', 'points', 'Mike', 'Meyers', 'Funny', 'goofy', 'ever', 'laughed', 'most', 'when', 'got', 'bathroom', 'scribbling', 'joke', 'when', 'sang', 'More', 'Than', 'Words', 'latter', 'due', 'primarily', 'get-up.Justin', 'Timberlake', 'Why', 'do', 'people', 'scoff', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'much', 'Qu', 'eacute', 'eacute', 'cois', 'imagine', 'Timberlake', 'portrayed', 'fine', 'parody', 'one.Jessica', 'Alba', 'character', 'fit', 'least', 'well', 'stood', 'own', 'good', 'sport', 'doing', 'things', 'Bollywood', 'style.Ben', 'Kingsley', 'Gandhi', 'Guru', 'Tugginmypudha', 'what', 'more', 'shall', 'say', 'Verne', 'Troyer', 'Not', 'man', 'was', ""n't"", 'funny', 'before', 'really', 'liked', 'bad-a**', 'attitude', 'Coach.Overall', 'names', 'were', 'silly', 'do', ""n't"", 'catch', 'meaning', 'phonetically', 'then', 'read', 'where', 'jokes', 'were', 'constant', 'meaning', 'was', 'superficial', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'time']",The Love Guru
1142689,A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ,B0013J30YU,Jason,"[6, 8]","The problem with this movie is that it's one of the least funny comedies ever created.  Ever.  Not only did I stop watching Love Guru half-way through the movie - something I have NEVER done before - but during that time, the unthinkable happened: I looked down upon Jessica Alba.  In all seriousness, Alba's next movie could be a 90-minute monstrosity with her kicking house-pets, burning down soup kitchens, and feeding toddlers to hyenas, and I'd still probably look favorably upon her performance.  So why is this so bad?Well, it's not me.  Into-Me-I-See.  I laughed hard at Super Troopers, Old School, Superbad, and Talladega Nights, so I'm a big fan of juvenile humor.  I quote daily from the three Austin Powers movies, as well as Wayne's World, so it's not Mike Myers.  I compared the Feast series to the Godfather series, and Johnny Knoxville consistently makes me laugh, so it has nothing to do with vulgarity.  I love Jessica Alba and midgets, so it's not Jessica Alba or Verne Troyer.  I even enjoy B-movies, so it's not the fact that this is a B-movie.As far as the ""plot"" goes, Guru Pitka (Myers) is an American self help guru who learned his skills in India from cross-eyed Guru Tugginmypudha (Ben Kingsley) (ba-dum-cha!).  Pitka is hired by a Jane Bullard (Alba), to help her emotionally dysfunctional hockey team (ba-dum-cha!).  Full of idiotic catch phrases and acronyms, Pitka hopes to dethrone Deepak Chopra as one of the resident mumbo-jumbo experts on the Oprah Show (ba-dum-cha!).  Midget joke here (ba-dum-cha!), genitalia joke there (ba-dum-cha!).Make no mistake; it looks big budget.  The cast, crew, and everyone involved: top notch.  There are even big name cameos like Val Kilmer.  The problem is it's just not funny.  Just look at the name of Kingsley's character again to see how bad the comedy is.

1142691,A3C6CZC2JP67VK,B0013J30YU,"Jenny J.J.I. ""A New Yorker""","[6, 8]","I thought this film was alright. Most of the story, at least what there is of one, is obviously from the mind of Myers. He is fantastic at creating strange characters and bringing them to life. The thing here is the titular character is better suited to a recurring skit instead of a full length film. The initial joke wears off long before the closing credits and much of the humor is just a variation of the same theme.Basically Myers plays Guru Maurice Pitka, the second most famous guru, after Deepak Chopra. When the star player of the Toronto Maple Leafs, Darren Roanoke (Romany Malco) begins to falter just before the Stanley Cup the owner of the team, Jane Bullard (Jessica Alba) hires Pitka to get his game back. This plot line also demonstrates a love that Myers has for Hockey, a natural for a native born Canadian. The screenplay is full of jokes that push right up to the limits of good taste and boldly goes over that line. Most of the jokes are repetitive and while funny at first soon become increasingly annoying. Okay, the one concerning the name of Mariska Hargitay has a bit more staying power and is accentuated by a cameo by the actress. In fact this movie seems to have an inordinate number of well known guest appearances. Many of the jokes are on the level of grade school humor. One example concerns an Uncle Jack being helped off an elephant. I don't have to be explicit here; if you think back to sixth grade you've heard the joke before. It appears here that Myers was channeling his inner child while writing this script.Director Schnabel manages to get the most out of a cast that deserves better than this. How they got an actor like Sir Ben Kensley to play a cross eyed mentor is beyond belief but as the consummate actor he is Sir Ben gives it his all. Justin Timberlake also gives a surprisingly good performance here. As a pop music sensation he is wisely going for smaller off beat roles instead of prematurely trying to carry a whole film on his own. Alba is a beautiful young woman and she actually has a great scene of comic timing but here her looks are what is showcased.Paramount does do a great job of presenting the film to DVD. The audio and video are excellent and there are even a good number of extras. There are 11 deleted scenes if you really need to see things that were not considered good enough to make the final cut. I do have to admit I laughed at the blooper reel. It does seem that the cast had a great deal of fun making the flick. There are three featurettes that detail ever aspect of the production for those that really have to know.",3,2.5--This film seems so out of place in Mike Myers career.,1222041600,"09 22, 2008",2008,2597,"['thought', 'film', 'was', 'alright', 'Most', 'story', 'least', 'what', 'one', 'obviously', 'mind', 'Myers', 'fantastic', 'creating', 'strange', 'characters', 'bringing', 'life', 'thing', 'here', 'titular', 'character', 'better', 'suited', 'recurring', 'skit', 'instead', 'full', 'length', 'film', 'initial', 'joke', 'wears', 'off', 'long', 'closing', 'credits', 'much', 'humor', 'just', 'variation', 'same', 'theme.Basically', 'Myers', 'Guru', 'Maurice', 'Pitka', 'second', 'most', 'famous', 'guru', 'Deepak', 'Chopra', 'When', 'star', 'player', 'Toronto', 'Maple', 'Leafs', 'Darren', 'Roanoke', 'Romany', 'Malco', 'falter', 'just', 'Stanley', 'Cup', 'owner', 'team', 'Jane', 'Bullard', 'Jessica', 'Alba', 'Pitka', 'get', 'game', 'back', 'plot', 'line', 'also', 'love', 'Myers', 'Hockey', 'natural', 'native', 'born', 'Canadian', 'screenplay', 'full', 'jokes', 'push', 'right', 'up', 'limits', 'good', 'taste', 'boldly', 'line', 'Most', 'jokes', 'are', 'repetitive', 'funny', 'first', 'soon', 'become', 'increasingly', 'annoying', 'Okay', 'one', 'concerning', 'name', 'Mariska', 'Hargitay', 'bit', 'more', 'staying', 'power', 'accentuated', 'cameo', 'actress', 'fact', 'movie', 'have', 'inordinate', 'number', 'well', 'known', 'guest', 'appearances', 'Many', 'jokes', 'are', 'level', 'grade', 'school', 'humor', 'One', 'example', 'concerns', 'Uncle', 'Jack', 'being', 'helped', 'off', 'elephant', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'explicit', 'here', 'think', 'back', 'sixth', 'grade', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'joke', 'here', 'Myers', 'was', 'channeling', 'inner', 'child', 'writing', 'script.Director', 'Schnabel', 'get', 'most', 'cast', 'better', 'How', 'got', 'actor', 'Sir', 'Ben', 'Kensley', 'play', 'cross', 'eyed', 'mentor', 'belief', 'consummate', 'actor', 'Sir', 'Ben', 'Justin', 'Timberlake', 'also', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'performance', 'here', 'pop', 'music', 'sensation', 'wisely', 'going', 'smaller', 'off', 'beat', 'roles', 'instead', 'prematurely', 'trying', 'carry', 'whole', 'film', 'own', 'Alba', 'beautiful', 'young', 'woman', 'actually', 'great', 'scene', 'comic', 'timing', 'here', 'looks', 'are', 'what', 'showcased.Paramount', 'do', 'great', 'job', 'presenting', 'film', 'DVD', 'audio', 'video', 'are', 'excellent', 'are', 'even', 'good', 'number', 'extras', 'are', '11', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'really', 'need', 'see', 'things', 'were', 'not', 'considered', 'good', 'enough', 'make', 'final', 'cut', 'do', 'have', 'admit', 'laughed', 'blooper', 'reel', 'seem', 'cast', 'had', 'great', 'deal', 'fun', 'making', 'flick', 'are', 'three', 'featurettes', 'detail', 'ever', 'aspect', 'production', 'really', 'have', 'know']",The Love Guru

1142701,A1554784OZLZFO,B0013J30YU,K. Mcleod,"[5, 9]","After viewing this film...I was left wondering where the funny Mike Myers was.  The film is about a guru who is a guide to a young hockey player's love life, but has never been in love himself.  It is the job of the guru to help the hockey player (played by  Malco) with his love life as well as his professional life.  I found the humor to be recycled jokes and puns that could have been better presented.  The humor from the Guru (books with long titles, telling people intimacy means 'into me I see', and making jokes about jacking off to an elephant) just didn't cut it for me.  I spent over an hour waiting to crack a smile.The same goes for Vern Troy's parts.  I suppose I was expecting the duo to do the same magic they did in Austin Powers.  He played the Maple Leafs manager and had a micro office that four other characters tried to squeeze into.  That scene was funny. Troyer's part had a number of short jokes (him being offered shrimp during dinner, and being called a gnome when 'name' was meant)and stunts, but again, not much to laugh about.Jessica Alba played the owner of the T.O Maple Leafs and towards the end her indian dance moves reminded me of what I saw in 'The Guru'. It was lovely and colorful choreograpy. Not much can be said about her character; a nice woman who's team was cursed until the guru came along.Justin Timberlake played a not-so-funny french hockey player who was known as Le coq (for his large penis).  I understood some of the french humor and curse words used, but again was not impressed. Particularly with the fight scene between he and the guru.As for Romany Malco it was great to see him in a more interesting role where he's not swearing constantly.  I remember him from 'The Chateau' and never thought I'd see him again.  He played a broken-hearted hockey player who was afraid to contront his mother (played by Thelma Hopkins).The critics were correct.

My husband said in order to really get the humor in a lot of the movie, you have to watch it more than once because you hear and see things you didn't focus in on before or just didn't understand exactly what he was implying. As you watch it again, and even yet again, you become more comfortable with the characters and then start to really understand more of the humor and references because it doesn't pass by so quickly. I don't like parts of comedies going by without knowing most of what they're referencing, so I googled a bunch of names, words, and references from the movie that I didn't quite understand... and I gotta tell ya, this movie was genius and hilarious!! I can even say that I LOVE it so much that it's right up there with Jim Carrey's best! After seeing this movie over and over again, I'm still interpreting different parts in different ways and I find it just as comical as before!

Some things you feel are a bit stale as you have seen Mike Myers do them before, but there is a lot of gags and jokes that just make you burst out laughing during the movie.It wont win any prizes for greatest character or plot, or any best film awards, but who cares, it's just a feel good comedy with typical Mike Myers humor all through it.If you can't walk away saying this was at least an OK movie, or you did not laugh through the movie, you really need to have the stick removed from your ###something I found great was I hate Justin Timberlake, but during his scenes, I didn't even know it was him till I watched a bonus feature.

You know, I think Mike Myers is a funny guy, and given the fact that I'm a huge hockey fan, I should really be into this movie...... right?Anywho, let's take a quick look at the film.  The plot:  Guru Pitka (Myers), while on a quest to become the next Deepak Chopra, is hired by Toronto Maple Leafs GM Jane Bullard (Jessica Alba) to help Leafs star Darren Roanoke (Romany Malco) win his estranged wife (Meagan Goode) back from Los Angeles Kings goaltender/crazy Celine Dion fan Jacques Grande (Justin Timberlake), who's known for his large... you get the picture.  In helping out Roanoke, Pitka must put away his fears towards relationships himself, as well as determine whether fame or fortune are as important as living up to the standards he preaches.  Will he sell out or will he do the right thing?(I'm not going to spoil it for you, but it shouldn't take a rocket scientist to answer that question because there are no surprises in this film.)So how did it do?  The movie was as asinine as suggesting that the Kings or Leafs will be Cup contenders in the near future.  Unlike the Austin Powers movies, it's becoming harder to pretend that all of Mike Myers' characters are anyone else other than, well, Mike Myers.  The weak and redundant plot attempts to use a barrage of toilet jokes to keep it afloat, but largely fails after 20 minutes or so.  Had the style of humor been used less frequently, it would have elicited a better response.  Yet the use of the constant gags to keep the story line afloat should have given way to the notion that the move was less of an artistic endeavor and more of a vehicle for Myers to showcase his love of hockey and his celebrity buddies.However, there were a few things that saved this movie.  For starters, despite limited screen time, Timberlake was oddly funny as his French-Canadian counterpart.  Further, Stephen Colbert was hilarious as the HNIC announcer and had great chemistry with the other co-announcer Jim Gaffigan.  Finally, in an oddly prophetic move, the two teams that L.A. and Toronto are shown having their way with en route to the Stanley Cup Finals were Detroit and Pittsburgh, who actually contended for the Cup.All and all though, if you're able to rent this for a buck or for free at your local library, you may find enough humor to get your money's worth.

Kellner ""PAK""","[2, 4]","""The Love Guru"", directed by Marco Schnabel and written by Mike MyersDarren Roanoke (Romany Malco) is the star player of the Toronto Maple Leafs hockey team. Unfortunately Darren is having problems with his marriage and the stress has caused his game to fall off and the result has been a losing streak for the Maple Leafs. Jane Bullard (Jessica Alba) the owner of the team is determined to get them back to their winning ways and prove to herself and the fans that the poor performances of the Maple Leafs is not her fault. To do this she enlist the help of Guru Maurice Pitka (Mike Myers) in hopes of reconciling the relationship between Darren and his wife Prudence who is now involved in a passionate relationship with Jacques Grande (Justin Timberlake) who is a goalie for the Maple Leaf's Rival. Guru Pitka, motivated by the possibility that he may overtake Deepak Chopra as the number 1 Guru agrees to take the job and hilarity ensues...I have been a fan of a lot of Mike Myers' work including ""Austin Powers - International Man of Mystery (New Line Platinum Series)"" and ""Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me (New Line Platinum Series)"" but since those it seem like his efforts have been on the decline. I didn't love ""Austin Powers in Goldmember"", heard terrible things about ""Dr. Seuss' The Cat in the Hat (Full Screen Edition)"" and now this debacle. I was skeptical going in as I wasn't the least bit impressed with the trailer but since I felt Myers had the talent to write good movies and carry them with his acting that I would give it a shot. Unfortunately my initial impression was the correct one and the movie was very disappointing.The Good: It is always nice to see Jesica Alba on screen even when her performance feels half hearted as it did in this. I had no problems with the look and sound of the movie. As much as I hate to admit it, Justin Timberlake gave a decent performance or as good of one as could be giver for his character.The Bad: It is always bad when the comedy in a comedy falls flat and doesn't work as is the case in ""The Love Guru"". The vast majority of the humor just doesn't work and feels forced. Myers also need to stop creating work for Verne Troyer or at least pull it way back to minor roles as that bit has run it's course as far as getting laughs. The story overall is ludicrous which is typical of Myers' movies and would have been fine had the comedy been strong enough to carry the movie but since it fell flat you as a viewer are left to pick apart everything else.Overall: ""The Love Guru"" just felt like Mike Myers was trying to cash in on the last bit of buzz his name has to offer.

I know it sounds like a recipe for a bad sports movie, but it isn't. The movie really has little to do with hockey at all. The focus is on Mike Myers's schtick and Justin Timberlake delivering comedy gold (as Le Coq).The movie had a few hilarious scenes, but was just decent overall. I know it has not been well-reviewed by anyone, but I think most people's expectations were way too high. This is Mike Myers rehashing a few of the old bits that have brought him success in the Austin Powers franchise. His interaction with Vern Troyer (more affectionately known as Mini Me) is silly and for some people it is past its prime.

One for Worst Movie, another for Worst Screenplay, and yet another for Worst Actor, Mike Myers. It was also a certified Box Office Bomb. Now, it's things like that which usually grab my interest.I can remember years ago reading the reviews in the papers for Mike Myers' Austin Powers movies, and the critics would almost always trash these films. When I would eventually see the movies for myself, I would enjoy them immensely. It turned out that most times a reviewer would tear apart a movie, most times I turned out to really like those movies. And this is another example of one of those movies hated by critics, but loved by me.Mike Myers plays the character, Guru Pitka, who is a spiritual self-help Guru who longs to be the #1 Guru in the world. He is a rather silly, crude, rude, and bumbling fella who manages to get into all kinds of zany situations. Sound familiar?Yes, Pitka is similar in a lot of respects to Myers' other famous character, Austin Powers. Myers plays the character much like he did Austin, with a sly grin, a knowing wink, and a nod to the audience, and basically hams it up for laughs all the while milking every joke for what it's worth. And ham it up he does. Which is why I love this movie.The jokes aren't the funniest and they're nothing we haven't seen before a dozen times already, but, to see the way Mike and the rest of the cast mugs it up in their roles throughout the movie makes it all worthwhile. I found myself chuckling and giggling quite a bit at their antics.

His once legendary skills have begun to diminish, due to his recent breakup with longtime girlfriend Prudence (played by Meagan Good).  As a result of the rapid decline of the team's record, Guru Maurice Pitka (Mike Myers) is called in by the owner of the Maple Leafs (Jessica Alba) to try to help Darren get his game and his girl back.Guru Pitka is considered to be the second greatest ""love guru"" in the world.  He has written several books on the subject matter, and his ultimate goal is to appear on the Oprah show and become the number one love guru in the world.  His best shot of achieving this goal is to help Darren and the Maple Leafs reestablish themselves as a highly skilled team.  The story can be lackluster, at times, but the jokes can be quite invigorating.  Through a series of offbeat jokes and major laughs produced by not only Mike Myers, Jessica Alba, Justin Timberlake, Verne Troyer, and Romany Malco, but also by the wisecracking announcer played by Stephen Colbert, the laughs are consistent and frequent.Everyone in the movie seems to have something to prove, not only to themselves, but to someone else as well.  For Darren, it's proving he's more of a man than his mom thought; for Jane it's showing the fans of the Leafs that she is a competent owner; and for Guru Pitka it's much more than what he initially intended.  Many of the jokes come off as ""childish"" and immature, seeming more like jokes that junior high students would find funny, while others are actually quite good.  Mike Myers does a great job at playing the second most famous love Guru, and his humorous acronyms and abbreviations are quite unique.  Jessica Alba, as usual, is beautiful, but looks aside, she does a great job at producing a few laughs of her own.  This seemingly all-star cast did a great job despite the somewhat lacking storyline.  The blooper reel is a great special feature worth checking out as well.  All in all, I would say to check this film out if you're a fan of Mike Myers' comedy films.",4,"Decent Film, I Enjoyed My Viewing Time",1263859200,"01 19, 2010",2010,2626,"['bunch', 'wisecracking', 'comedians', 'gather', 'hockey', 'rink', 'order', 'assist', 'star', 'player', 'Toronto', 'Maple', 'Leafs', 'come', 'back', 'prior', 'level', 'skills', 'Why', 'have', 'skills', 'diminished', 'recently', 'lost', 'girlfriend', 'rival', 'hockey', 'player', 'name', 'Jacque', 'Grande', 'played', 'Justin', 'Timberlake', 'Wait', 'did', 'actually', 'watch', 'film', 'Justin', 'Timberlake', 'Yes', 'surprisingly', 'was', 'very', 'good.The', 'story', 'around', 'just', 'Darren', 'played', 'Romany', 'Malco', 'once', 'all-star', 'caliber', 'hockey', 'player', 'star', 'player', 'Maple', 'Leafs', 'begun', 'lose', 'touch', 'rink', 'once', 'legendary', 'skills', 'have', 'begun', 'diminish', 'due', 'recent', 'breakup', 'longtime', 'girlfriend', 'Prudence', 'played', 'Meagan', 'Good', 'result', 'rapid', 'decline', 'team', 'record', 'Guru', 'Maurice', 'Pitka', 'Mike', 'Myers', 'called', 'owner', 'Maple', 'Leafs', 'Jessica', 'Alba', 'try', 'help', 'Darren', 'get', 'game', 'girl', 'back.Guru', 'Pitka', 'considered', 'be', 'second', 'greatest', 'love', 'guru', 'world', 'written', 'several', 'books', 'subject', 'matter', 'ultimate', 'goal', 'appear', 'Oprah', 'show', 'become', 'number', 'one', 'love', 'guru', 'world', 'best', 'shot', 'achieving', 'goal', 'help', 'Darren', 'Maple', 'Leafs', 'reestablish', 'highly', 'skilled', 'team', 'story', 'can', 'be', 'lackluster', 'times', 'jokes', 'can', 'be', 'quite', 'invigorating', 'series', 'offbeat', 'jokes', 'major', 'laughs', 'produced', 'not', 'only', 'Mike', 'Myers', 'Jessica', 'Alba', 'Justin', 'Timberlake', 'Verne', 'Troyer', 'Romany', 'Malco', 'also', 'wisecracking', 'announcer', 'played', 'Stephen', 'Colbert', 'laughs', 'are', 'consistent', 'frequent.Everyone', 'movie', 'have', 'something', 'prove', 'not', 'only', 'someone', 'else', 'as', 'well', 'Darren', 'proving', 'more', 'man', 'mom', 'thought', 'Jane', 'showing', 'fans', 'Leafs', 'competent', 'owner', 'Guru', 'Pitka', 'much', 'more', 'what', 'initially', 'intended', 'Many', 'jokes', 'come', 'off', 'childish', 'immature', 'seeming', 'more', 'like', 'jokes', 'junior', 'high', 'students', 'would', 'find', 'funny', 'others', 'are', 'actually', 'quite', 'good', 'Mike', 'Myers', 'great', 'job', 'playing', 'second', 'most', 'famous', 'love', 'Guru', 'humorous', 'acronyms', 'abbreviations', 'are', 'quite', 'unique', 'Jessica', 'Alba', 'usual', 'beautiful', 'aside', 'great', 'job', 'producing', 'few', 'laughs', 'own', 'seemingly', 'all-star', 'cast', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'somewhat', 'lacking', 'storyline', 'blooper', 'reel', 'great', 'special', 'feature', 'checking', 'out', 'as', 'well', 'would', 'say', 'check', 'film', 'out', ""'re"", 'fan', 'Mike', 'Myers', 'comedy', 'films']",The Love Guru
1142726,A38VQ2TIPPBKNN,B0013J30YU,"Sir Charles Panther ""Life is hard.  It's hard...","[18, 26]","I remember the negative rumblings when this film was in production.  The advance screening reviews did not treat it well, and most reviews once it opened also were not good, some of them downright brutal.  Then it was in and out of my local megaplexes in less than a month.  Now it's on DVD, right after the end of the summer, not even waiting for the holiday market, not even tying into some kind of wacky Halloween marketing-thing.Through all of these increasingly negative omens I kept faith, figuring, ""Hey, it's Mike Myers, the man who brought us ""Sprockets"" onSaturday Night Live, theWayne's Worldguy, theAustin Powersguy.""  I like to watchSo I Married an Axe Murdererwhen it's on cable; I even know most of that crazy ""O, Harriett"" beat poem.  I knew that while this particular film might not be his best, that it could be Mike Myers'Blame It On Rio, that I'd still find it overall funny and entertaining.Not so.  This film is absolute junk, right from the beginning.  It was so awful, I turned it off after 40 minutes.Yes, it really is that bad.  In Amazon.com reviews I have savaged--given them what they're due, actually--that ridiculous CGI-permeated gunkVan Helsingand that vapid HollywoodThe Stepford Wives (Special Collector's Edition)garbage, and I recently letI Am Legendhave it as well, each for their own failings.  But I sat through each of those stinkers, right through to the end titles.  This one didn't even earn that level of interest and respect.  By forty minutes, I had had enough of the idiotic humor, the flat jokes, the bad characters, Myers wallowing in his own grossly overinflated sense of comedic creativity and personal hip-itude, and I had no interest at all in seeing how it would all turn out.Myers plays a wacky Indian guru, a holy man specializing in love and relationships, but he has neither love nor a relationship of his own, and a clanking elephant-head chastity belt to boot.  The guru comes across as self-centered, money-grubbing, commercially prostituted, demented, capricious, manipulative and foul.  There is no serenity, no grace, not the slightest indication of any kind of scholarly depth, just a rapid-fire stream of idiotic caca-doody and genital jokes.  It's all urine and feces, phallic goofs, simulated pain inflicted on male sexual parts, the kind of stuff I found trite once I matured into 7th grade.  Now, I love theJackassmovies, so I know from funny in slapstick agony, genitals and excretory humor.  But this film was just mindless, moronic junk, a collection of Myers' jokes and stupid puns, the stuff that didn't make the cut for the second Austin Powers sequel, run together with a contrived, meandering, patchwork, pathetically predictable story.If you've seen the film, you'll know that Myers' Guru Pitka would say that this film is pure Comprehensive Radical Adjustment Participation.I mean, in the scene in which Myer's guru and his destined love have their first big date, he has arranged a very special meal which looks exactly like human testicles.  Both he and Jessica Alba bray their way through the endless stupid jokes, it all ending with the hilariously beaten and mutilated edible having to be discarded.  We've already been beaten over the head that the guru wants Alba as THE love of his incongruously empty life, and so this is the way he, The Love Guru, the man who has so much depth and experience in love and relationships, creates his first impression for his one-and-only?  Absolute garbage.Myers' Indian guru character offended even me, and I'm about as white-bread as they come.  His bad Indian accent drifted in between the Saturday Night Live/""So I Married an Axe Murderer"" Scottish Dad, Fat Bastard and Shrek.  I mean, he couldn't even take the time to get his Indian accent down, so busy was he working on these complex, meaningful, mutually reinforcing gags about elephant dung and fighting with mops dripping with the fresh urine of his deeply honored guru-master.Vern Troyer is reduced to spewing profanities, being the butt of increasingly vicious little-person jokes and a series of demeaning, ugly sight gags in which he is always the victim of physical violence.Ben Kingsley--the guy who played freeking Gandhi, and won the Oscar for it--is reduced to playing a cross-eyed clown.  Sad.Jessica Alba is stunning, predictably, but still just can't act, even in this shallow story.And then there was the endless parade of celebs who want to be in a Mike Myers film, from Val Kilmer to Oprah, bad and forced cameos all, the kind of overblown star-packing formula that made me puke in ""Goldmember.""The only good part I encountered lasted all of 20 seconds, a wonderfully done, detailed spin on the typical Bollywood boy-girl musical number, with Myers and Alba.  It was great, right down to the disorienting camera zooms, the impossible physical backdrops, the music and lyrics, the nauseatingly deep, warbling color and a jittery box with understated yet funny subtitles.  This was what this film should have been.Bottom line: Avoid this film; there is nothing redeeming in it.  For a more entertaining South Asian romantic comedy experience, watchThe Guruinstead.",1,"Miserably, Wretchedly Awful",1224028800,"10 15, 2008",2008,5161,"['remember', 'negative', 'rumblings', 'when',

Dis is my day of lucky!"" and his acting leaves me a little impressed.(surprise, surprise) I even find myself wishing he acted more.Oh! I also enjoyed comedian Daniel Tosh in his minute-long role as 'cowboy hat' I think that in a film so, so terrible he was a shining star. Stephen Colbert and Jim Gaffigan were also nice as the hockey announcers.Other then that, the Guru Pitka(Mike Myers) is an unfunny and annoying Guru from India(with Catch phrases and everything!) who's trying to triumph over his rival Deepak Chopra and go on the Oprah show. And of course, the only way this is all possible is for Pitka to succeed in reuniting hockey player Darren Roanoke(Romany Malco)and his wife Prudence(Meagan Good).Any more into the summary and so-called plot is just a waste, save your money and your time and opt for a Myer's classic like Wayne's World instead.",1,"His Karma is Huge?

When it comes to Hollywood movies, things were most certainly better when the movie business didn't release so many movies or beat successful horses until every last original thought or joke devolves into boring and fatuous formula. Welcome to the career of Mike Myers.Maybe if the bulk of Myer's resume wasn't bullet-pointed with sequels and he hadn't showed us all the goodies in his comedy tool box; e.g., an entertaining mix of sophomoric innuendo, spot-on satire of genres, cheeky names, and the always-popular jokes regarding genitalia or bowel movements, he wouldn't have exhausted his repertoire and we wouldn't have to suffer through The Love Guru. This newest offering is as predictable as the jokes you see coming a mile away. Making it worse is that the premise isn't even that interesting. Like so many comedy movies released of late, there is a thread of a plot wrapped around ninety minutes of extremely tired jokes. The actors do their best and there are some smiles and mild chuckles, but most of it is just groan-inducing and expected.I really like Mike Myers and want to believe that he has some great movies left in him, but to take several years to come up with this yawn-fest makes me question my beliefs.

1142733,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B0013J30YU,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[4, 6]","From the moment I first heard Mike Meyer's new film ""The Love Guru"" and Steve Carell's new film ""Get Smart"" would be released on the same day, I was surprised. Common practice in Hollywood dictates you don't release two such similar films on the same day. At best, you are going to split the audience, and both films could suffer. This seems to have been born out by the box office, with ""The Love Guru"" suffering.Because both films were released on the same day, I decided to see both, back to back. And I am going to write about both, back to back.The Love Guru ***Get Smart *I really get the sense Mike Meyer's is trying to channel the spirit of Peter Sellers. Consciously or not, he has created two characters with more than a few similarities to some of Sellers' most famous creations. Austin Powers has more than a few things in common with Inspector Clouseau and now the Guru Pitka has more than a few things in common with Harundai V. Bakshi, Sellers character in the less well-known Blake Edward's film ""The Party"". Meyers is a talented guy, a funny guy, who seems to obsess over every detail in his films. Sellers was, reportedly, the same way. While Sellers' characters will continue to endure the test of time, we don't know if the more modern Meyer's work will have the same outcome. It's too early to tell.Meyer's ""The Love Guru"" is a silly film. From the moment I first saw the trailer, I laughed, a lot. Filled with silly, ""Austin Powers""-esque comedy, there were a lot of jokes packed in that trailer and the movie delivers more of the same.The movie is very silly and packed with jokes, many of which work and many of which don't. The jokes fly fast and furious, and Meyers certainly tries very hard to get the audience to laugh. I half expected someone to throw a cream pie at Meyers. But there is also the smack of familiarity to many of the jokes. They could easily have been trans planted into ""Austin Powers 4"" and provided the same laughs. It also seems odd that Verne Troyer is also in the new film, playing a different character, but his presence makes the comparisons to Austin Powers all the more prevalent. And many of the jokes concerning his character revolve around the same humor Mini-Me elicited in the Powers films.If anything is to be learned from Meyer's comedy, he loves midgets and fart jokes, both providing equal opportunity for laughs.Meyers has done a lot of interviews and in many he has mentioned the profound impact the death of his father had on his life. This led him to meet Depak Chopra, the very famous guru and self-help coach who has apparently provided Meyers with a lot of guidance. ""The Love Guru"" tells the story of Guru Pitka, the Number Two guru in the United States, behind Deepak Chopra. Pitka desperately wants to become Number One and the Toronto Maple Leafs provide him with an opportunity, their star goalie Darren Roanoake (Romany Malco, ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"") has broken up with his wife Prudence (Meagan Good) and is not playing well. With the Stanley Cup around the corner, the team's owner, Jane Bullard (Jessica Alba), hires Pitka to bring Roanoke and Prudence back together. Naturally, there are complications. Pitka finds himself attracted to Jane and Prudence is dating the star goalie for the Los Angeles Kings, a Celine Dion-loving Canadian, Jacques ""The Cock"" Grande (Justin Timberlake).Meyers lets the jokes fly fast and furious; from the opening frames when we hear narration by Morgan Freeman, to the Guru Pitka's constant use of bad trademarked sayings, the film has a lot of laughs. But Meyers is also dependent on scatological humor and there are a lot of jokes involving farts, bowel movements, accidents and more, jokes too silly for even this film.""The Love Guru"" suffers from a number of small problems. The first is the humor throughout the film is so juvenile; it is extremely hit and miss. Everyone can only take so many fart jokes or jokes about 'messing your pants'. The other thing I found odd about the film is that at a couple of key moments, they don't go far enough with the ideas. Early on, Pitka remembers a key moment in his life and we watch it much like a Bollywood film, complete with scratches and film burn. This is a great idea and only reinforces the wackiness of the story and the idea, but it only lasts a few moments. At the end of the film, Pitka claims ""I want to dance"" and a Bollywood musical number begins in a small seaside village. Jessica Alba dances out, his assistant becomes a part of the entourage, even Verne Troyer takes part. This is a moment, much like the end of ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"", when you would expect all of the characters to join in and start dancing in a highly synchronized way to an American rock song, in this case ""The Rocker"". But the dance number only involves the few characters mentioned and only lasts a few seconds. It seems like they ran out of money and simply had to get what they could.Also, I have seen a number of films recently in which well-known comedians play Sports Commentators (most of these star Will Farell as he seems to have the lock on this franchise, ""Semi-Pro"", ""Blades of Glory""). In ""The Love Guru"", Stephen Colbert and Jim Gaffigan play hockey commentators and they suffer from the same fate as the others; they simply aren't funny. Each of these characters is decidedly ""wacky"", and says ""off-color"" things, and tries to act like they are weird and funny. But in each of these films, the characters look like they are trying to act weird and funny and this does little than to slow down the rest of the story.It is amusing that Meyers is making fun of something so ripe for parody. But he also takes aim at the very type of thing Chopra has risen above, making his character a more desperate version of someone like Chopra. It works, but not all the time.",3,Meyers Throws in Everything Including the Kitchen Sink,1215388800,"07 7, 2008",2008,5831,"['moment', 'first', 'heard', 'Mike', 'Meyer', 'new', 'film', 'Love',

1142734,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B0013J30YU,Tsuyoshi,"[3, 5]","""The Love Guru"" stars Mike Myers who gave us two successful films years ago, ""Austin Powers"" and ""Shrek."" Both films, witty and hugely entertaining, featured characters you can identify with, had lots of funny jokes and clever parodies of a certain film genre. Then in 2003 he made awful ""The Cat in the Hat."" We waited for five years since then and what we get is ""The Love Guru,"" another disappointing film from Mike Myers.""The Love Guru"" has none of the style that made ""Austin Powers"" such a success. Mike Myers plays Guru Pitka, an American-born self help guru raised in India. Without letting us know how and why he was raised in India and became a guru, the film proceeds to tell us that Guru Pitka is hired by a hockey team owner played by Jessica Alba because her team's star player, she believes, really needs the help of the spiritual leader. But why a hockey player?I know comedy is a subjective thing. Not everybody is going to laugh at the same thing. Don't get me wrong. I like silly jokes. I like sex jokes. But something is definitely wrong with the comedy when the actors start to look like desperate standup comic or clown waiting for laughs that will never come, trying to make us laugh with whatever gags he thinks of - cross-eyed Ben Kingsley's mentor, repetitious ""Mariska Hargitay"" mantra and of course, elephants.Perhaps ""The Love Guru,"" Mike Myers's Razzie-winning comedy, does not deserve the award given to the year's worst film. Compare it with any films directed by Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer and their ""spoofs,"" and maybe Myers's latest effort will look slightly better.
