Although I loved the show from episode 1, it definitely got better once Heather Locklear came into it.  I'm so glad she remained with the show until the end.

I have seen the whole six years of Melrose Place and was really thrilled. The show had everything; romance, deceit, and enough going on that you (me) couldn't wait to put in the next tape.I now see why Heather Locklear got her big break - she was terrific (and I never particularly liked her or had seen her in anything before Melrose). The story takes place in a LA apartment building  and the residents are where the various storylines come in. Lots of love and lots of good looking guys and gals.  Many of the actors I recognize from other shows. Heather plays a high powered big wig at an advertisement company. She is not the most pleasant person but here and there you see her vulnerbility. There are lots of lies, lots of loving going on in this apartment. The set is really neat with the apartment laid out on two floors and a swimming pool in the middle. Everybody can see everybody and everyone knows everyone's business. I don't want to give anything away but this is not to be passed up; I don't know why I never watched it but I am really glad that I finally did!",5,A BIG SURPRISE,1354752000,"12 6, 2012",2012,1231,"['had', 'heard', 'Melrose', 'Place', 'did', ""n't"", 'watch', 'it-', '90210', 'was', 'radar', 'went', 'air', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'interested', '..boy', 'was', 'stupid', 'have', 'seen', 'whole', 'six', 'years', 'Melrose', 'Place', 'was', 'really', 'thrilled', 'show', 'had', 'everything', 'romance', 'deceit', 'enough', 'going', 'could', ""n't"", 'wait', 'put', 'next', 'tape.I', 'now', 'see', 'why', 'Heather', 'Locklear', 'got', 'big', 'break', 'was', 'terrific', 'never', 'particularly', 'liked', 'had', 'seen', 'anything', 'Melrose', 'story', 'place', 'LA', 'apartment', 'building', 'residents', 'are', 'where', 'various', 'storylines', 'come', 'Lots', 'love', 'lots', 'good', 'looking', 'guys', 'gals', 'Many', 'actors', 'recognize', 'other', 'shows', 'Heather', 'high', 'powered', 'big', 'wig', 'advertisement', 'company', 'not', 'most', 'pleasant', 'person', 'here', 'there', 'see', 'vulnerbility', 'are', 'lots', 'lies', 'lots', 'loving', 'going', 'apartment', 'set', 'really', 'neat', 'apartment', 'laid', 'out', 'two', 'floors', 'swimming', 'pool', 'middle', 'Everybody', 'can', 'see', 'everybody', 'everyone', 'everyone', 'business', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'anything', 'away', 'not', 'be', 'passed', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'never', 'watched', 'am', 'really', 'glad', 'finally', 'did']",Melrose Place: Season 6 - Volume 1 & 2
