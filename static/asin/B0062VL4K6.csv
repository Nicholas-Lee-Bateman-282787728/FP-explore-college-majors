1508840,A2RVCF21L2NPU5,B0062VL4K6,"Cherise Kachelmuss ""Mom and More""","[3, 3]","My boys are huge Chuck & Friends fans and this DVD is perfect for them.  With 10 episodes there is a lot of Chuck and Friends to enjoy.  I love that now only are the trucks fun and colorful they are also wholesome.  The episodes teach such great lessons such as working together, helping out friends in need, making decisions and accepting responsibility.  My boys love that there is a good variety of trucks, which is especially important since one of my boys is a construction truck lover and the other is a monster truck fan!  This DVD is perfect for any child and there isn't a show like Chuck & Friends!  My 5 year old actually just got a Chuck & Friends stunt playset for his birthday and he thinks its hilarious to play with it and watch this DVD!
