It was fun seeing the Scooby Gang riding by famous landmarks in our city.  The plot is set around an Opera House that is not real, but it's fun that the Scooby Gang came to the real city of Chicago and had an adventure.  The movie has a lot of twists and turns in the plot so that it was a very difficult mystery to solve.  Few kids' movies keep adults guessing like this.It was also a nice commentary on the American Idol phenomenon without it being too instantly-dated.  There was nothing in this that would lock the movie into the year 2013, so it should be great viewing in the future for many decades.  But at the same time it was fresh and current enough that watching it you get the pop culture references.  This is NOT like watching Aladdin and having all the jokes feel stale because Robin Williams made them about life in the early 1990s...the jokes made in this Scooby movie are very timeless.The animation looked great...as good as the recent Scooby TV show Mystery Inc...but it had a more positive vibe to it than Mystery Inc (which, to me, was hard to watch sometimes because of the odd ""planetary disk"" plot).
