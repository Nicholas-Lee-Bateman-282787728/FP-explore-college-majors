In that movie Richard Harris is John Morgan, an Englsih baron captured by the Yellow Hand Sioux in the early 1800s and raised by them; being a great fighter he was given his freedom and returned to England in 1821.Now, three years later, Harris is bored in England and decides to return to America. When he does he finds the Yellow Hand have been driven off their lands or enslaved by white traders. He leads them in a fight to regain their lands.The movie is shot almost totally from the Indians' perspective, and great care has been taken to get it right and to treat the Indians and their ways honestly. There is a lengthy self-mutilation ceremony that is quite gory (but authentic); it was cut from some earlier prints as being too graphic, but it's essential as to why the tribe decides to fight for their land (they must purge themselves of the evil spirit first). The really memorable thing about the movie is the photography: the Dakota landscape is spectacular.",4,The Sioux fight for their lands,1133740800,"12 5, 2005",2005,1019,"['sequel', '1970', 'A', 'MAN', 'CALLED', 'HORSE', 'movie', 'Richard', 'Harris', 'John', 'Morgan', 'Englsih', 'baron', 'captured', 'Yellow', 'Hand', 'Sioux', 'early', '1800s', 'raised', 'being', 'great', 'fighter', 'was', 'given', 'freedom', 'returned', 'England', '1821.Now', 'three', 'years', 'later', 'Harris', 'bored', 'England', 'return', 'America', 'When', 'Yellow', 'Hand', 'have', 'been', 'driven', 'off', 'lands', 'enslaved', 'white', 'traders', 'fight', 'regain', 'lands.The', 'movie', 'shot', 'almost', 'totally', 'Indians', 'perspective', 'great', 'care', 'been', 'taken', 'get', 'right', 'treat', 'Indians', 'ways', 'honestly', 'lengthy', 'self-mutilation', 'ceremony', 'quite', 'gory', 'authentic', 'was', 'cut', 'earlier', 'prints', 'being', 'too', 'graphic', 'essential', 'why', 'tribe', 'fight', 'land', 'must', 'purge', 'evil', 'spirit', 'first', 'really', 'memorable', 'thing', 'movie', 'photography', 'Dakota', 'landscape', 'spectacular']",N/A

Its sequel ""The Return of a Man Called Horse"" (1976) wasn't so good, nevertheless is quite enjoyable.It tells the story of Lord John Morgan's return to the plains around 1840. He was languishing at his states in England when suddenly he feels the urge to return to America.He discovers that the Yellow Hands has been expelled from their sacred lands, her women enslaved and the rest of the tribe condemned to a miserable life due to the ""in force"" invasion of some fur traders.The trader gang has constructed a stronghold including cannons and settling allied native around the fort.Lord Morgan or Horse as he is known to his Sioux kin starts a new epic experience. Self imposing extreme hardships, first to attain a ""vision"", then he strengths very young tribesmen thru sacred rites, next he trains women to fight and finally devices a plan to expel the usurpers.The final combat is film's culmination and a very good action piece.Harris performs again with deep conviction even if the script is not as good as the original one he extract the maximum from his character.This time Sioux warriors are fleshed by Mexican actors and actresses instead of the multinational cast of the first film, without lose.Even with its flaws this film moves the spectator to admire and respect Native American culture.Give this film a try, you won't be disappointed!Reviewed by Max Yofre.",4,"Rescuing ""Yellow Hands""",1153699200,"07 24, 2006",2006,1659,"[""'m"", 'always', 'fascinated', 'books', 'movies', 'deal', 'interaction', 'subjects', 'different', 'cultures', 'such', 'Shogun', 'Lawrence', 'Arabia', 'Dances', 'Wolves', 'Broken', 'Arrow', '.The', 'original', 'film', 'Man', 'Called', 'Horse', '1970', 'had', 'very', 'special', 'place', 'memory', 'heart', 'sequel', 'Return', 'Man', 'Called', 'Horse', '1976', 'was', ""n't"", 'so', 'good', 'nevertheless', 'quite', 'enjoyable.It', 'story', 'Lord', 'John', 'Morgan', 'return', 'plains', '1840', 'was', 'languishing', 'states', 'England', 'when', 'suddenly', 'urge', 'return', 'America.He', 'discovers', 'Yellow', 'Hands', 'been', 'expelled', 'sacred', 'lands', 'women', 'enslaved', 'rest', 'tribe', 'condemned', 'miserable', 'life', 'due', 'force', 'invasion', 'fur', 'traders.The', 'trader', 'gang', 'constructed', 'stronghold', 'including', 'cannons', 'settling', 'allied', 'native', 'fort.Lord', 'Morgan', 'Horse', 'known', 'Sioux', 'kin', 'new', 'epic', 'experience', 'Self', 'imposing', 'extreme', 'hardships', 'first', 'attain', 'vision', 'then', 'very', 'young', 'tribesmen', 'thru', 'sacred', 'rites', 'women', 'fight', 'finally', 'devices', 'plan', 'expel', 'usurpers.The', 'final', 'combat', 'film', 'culmination', 'very', 'good', 'action', 'piece.Harris', 'performs', 'again', 'deep', 'conviction', 'even', 'script', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'original', 'one', 'maximum', 'character.This', 'time', 'Sioux', 'warriors', 'are', 'fleshed', 'Mexican', 'actors', 'actresses', 'instead', 'multinational', 'cast', 'first', 'film', 'lose.Even', 'flaws', 'film', 'spectator', 'admire', 'respect', 'Native', 'American', 'culture.Give', 'film', 'try', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed', 'Reviewed', 'Max', 'Yofre']",N/A
