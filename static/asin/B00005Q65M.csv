673978,A1AR8HYZ17T5H7,B00005Q65M,"""arxane""","[6, 14]","When I first saw the beginning of the movie, I could already tell that it wasn't going to be a classic of any kind. What else could I realize when the movies shows the main female character gratuitously (although mildly) nude for a minute or two? But this scene couldn't foreshadow how bad this movie would really be. After watching this film, it's easy to see why Masamune Shirow - the film's director and creator of the manga this film was based upon - decided not to direct later projects based upon his works like &quot;Appleseed&quot; (which is even worse).The premise of the film is promising, but the way everything is executed makes the movie fall flat. The coloring in the film is too varied and contrasting, and movements sometimes appear choppy and unnatural. But it's not the animation that ultimately brings this film down. Rather, it's a combination of a unbelievable plot, flat characters, and squirmish voice acting.The plot of &quot;Black Magic M-66&quot; is silly, to say the least. The idea that a reporter can save someone from a destruction-programed robot when the military can't isn't exactly believable. And then there's the question of why the robot wants to destroy the creator's granddaughter. They say it was programmed in the robot to begin with, but why choose the creator's granddaughter? It just doesn't make sense.And the characters themselves aren't fleshed out at all. The anti-hero heroine of the film doesn't create that feeling where we question her personality yet we appreciate what she's doing. She acts like a witch with a capital B. The other characters are equally bland, and this can be attributed to the voice acting. It's not the worst voice acting out there, but it's not that good, either. The way the characters speak sounds as if they memerized scripts sometime in their lives and they finally found the opportunity to say them.All in all, &quot;Black Magic M-66&quot; is a poor choice for anime fans. If you liked the manga this film was based on, you might consider looking into it. To everyone else, however, be very wary about this film.",2,A promising premise destroyed by poor execution.,1008115200,"12 12, 2001",2001,2092,"['When', 'first', 'saw', 'beginning', 'movie', 'could', 'already', 'tell', 'was', ""n't"", 'going', 'be', 'classic', 'kind', 'What', 'else', 'could', 'realize', 'when', 'movies', 'main', 'female', 'character', 'gratuitously', 'mildly', 'nude', 'minute', 'two', 'scene', 'could', ""n't"", 'foreshadow', 'how', 'bad', 'movie', 'would', 'really', 'be', 'watching', 'film', 'easy', 'see', 'why', 'Masamune', 'Shirow', 'film', 'director', 'creator', 'manga', 'film', 'was', 'based', 'decided', 'not', 'direct', 'later', 'projects', 'based', 'works', 'quot', 'Appleseed', 'quot', 'even', 'worse', '.The', 'premise', 'film', 'promising', 'way', 'everything', 'executed', 'movie', 'fall', 'flat', 'coloring', 'film', 'too', 'varied', 'contrasting', 'movements', 'sometimes', 'appear', 'choppy', 'unnatural', 'not', 'animation', 'ultimately', 'film', 'down', 'Rather', 'combination', 'unbelievable', 'plot', 'flat', 'characters', 'squirmish', 'voice', 'acting.The', 'plot', 'quot', 'Black', 'Magic', 'M-66', 'quot', 'silly', 'say', 'least', 'idea', 'reporter', 'can', 'save', 'someone', 'destruction-programed', 'robot', 'when', 'military', 'ca', ""n't"", ""n't"", 'exactly', 'believable', 'then', 'question', 'why', 'robot', 'destroy', 'creator', 'granddaughter', 'say', 'was', 'programmed', 'robot', 'begin', 'why', 'choose', 'creator', 'granddaughter', 'just', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense.And', 'characters', 'are', ""n't"", 'fleshed', 'out', 'anti-hero', 'heroine', 'film', ""n't"", 'create', 'feeling', 'where', 'question', 'personality', 'yet', 'appreciate', 'what', 'doing', 'witch', 'capital', 'B', 'other', 'characters', 'are', 'equally', 'bland', 'can', 'be', 'attributed', 'voice', 'acting', 'not', 'worst', 'voice', 'acting', 'there', 'not', 'good', 'either', 'way', 'characters', 'speak', 'memerized', 'scripts', 'sometime', 'lives', 'finally', 'found', 'opportunity', 'say', 'them.All', 'quot', 'Black', 'Magic', 'M-66', 'quot', 'poor', 'choice', 'anime', 'fans', 'liked', 'manga', 'film', 'was', 'based', 'might', 'consider', 'looking', 'everyone', 'else', 'however', 'be', 'very', 'wary', 'film']",N/A

It's not the best transfer or the deepest story, but it's got action and a cool robot that destroys things.  It's a bit short, but that's okay.  If it were longer, it would probably need a better story to justify sitting through the whole thing.

Both robots were being shipped by secret plane, but a thunderstorm causes the plane to crash land. Both robots escape the wreckage undamaged, except that they are malfunctioning, they want to kill all humans. They end up wiping out a military platoon and killing more innocent people, until a news reporter gets involved to help stop the two robots. The character design are pudgy faced and a bit ugly, so are the robots, but the action sequences are very exciting. My biggest disappointment was the fact that BMM66 is way too short.  The whole movie was so exciting that I wanted it to be longer. It is rumored that American director  James Cameron, got the idea for his, Terminator movie from this anime. You too will notice the similarities when you see this anime. Violence and blood at mild levels, but nothing extreme- for teenagers and adults.

Amith (kndy),"[1, 2]","I remember reading Masamune Shirow's manga &quot;ORION&quot; many, many years ago and I just had to find any anime based on his work.Well, the first video I watched by Shirow was &quot;Black Magic M66&quot; and now it's released on DVD.Watching this anime brought back a lot of memories because it is the first Shirow anime to be on DVD.  The plot is almost like the movie &quot;Terminator&quot; in a way but it's simple.  Military going after two killer robots who have been implanted with the wrong chip by the scientists to go after the head scientist's daughter.  Have no fear, Sybel - the non-fearing reporter and her partner is there.The anime is definitely 80's and somehow you think of &quot;Dirty Pair&quot; or other anime popular during that time.As for the DVD, the original anime I purchased was from US Renditions and now with Manga Entertainment you get a chance to watch it in English via Digital 5.1.  During the anime, I kept backtracking to compare the original Japanese 2.0 sound to the Digital 5.1.  You will hear some engine revs but not as much explosive sounds that I would expect via 5.1.  Sometimes at some areas I felt that the 2.0 sound was almost similar to the 5.1.Also, Manga Entertainment has been known for their good English dub work.  But this time, the dub work sounds similar to the dub work of other anime companies during that time...cheesy.As for special features, there is a character bio and cool promotions for Manga Entertainment and other cool DVD's from Palm Entertainment.There is no series after &quot;Black Magic M66&quot;, it's only a one-episode anime OAV.  You really have to be a big fan of Masamune Shirow to buy this anime.  At 48 minutes, this OAV may be too short for some and too expensive for some.All in all, a good anime to pass over time.

This disc has so many things mounting against it, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. Black Magic M-66 is really for those who are a fan of the old school anime, stuff that came out of the 80s. This title is animated in that style, and was produced in 1987.The movie itself isn't very long, only about 45 minutes. The plot is basically just this: army chases renegade robots, journalist chases army while chasing after a story. Everyone is running in all sorts of directions, and after watching it, you really wonder why you wasted an hour of your life. Basically if you are into slight nudity, lots of explosions and violence you may enjoy this film for the sheer cheese.Now on to the video. It's supposedly remastered. Remastered? Does sharpening something so much that immobile objects and people's clothes look like they are jumping off the characters classify as remastered? Colors are bright but they are way oversaturated, and depending on your setup they may bleed.And for the love of a higher power, stay away from the English dub. It is absolutely horrible. The actors made me cringe in their efforts at being army men, and all the women had very squeaky voices. The supposed 5.1 English track is just louder conversations, and louder background noises.
