The movie has a moral undertone that is subtle and ironic and is spiced with occasional sparks of humor and philosophy.

People either love him or hate him, both with good reason.No Such Thing closely follows the rythm and pacing of Hartley's Amateur, itself an almost perfect film in my opinion. You will not find traditional Hollywood motifs in this movie (or his others). The setups and payoffs are subtle. The emotions are often conveyed through a word or a glance, as opposed to a bullhorn directed at the audience. Subtlety over brute force is his preferred approach.No Such Thing contains many levels of myth, fable and parable. From the obvious references to such classics as The Little Mermaid and Beauty and the Beast (NOT the Disney versions), to more esoteric nods, this film delivers in ways that most others simple could not. Watching Hellen Mirren's character transform before us in the blink of an eye in such a believeable way was breathtaking. There was no rousing score directing the viewer towards the appropriate emotional conclusion. There was no arrogant buildup of camera work, no amazingly contrived series of scenes leading the viewer like crumbs of bread. Some people enjoy being led along and enjoy being rewarded for picking up on the &quot;subtle&quot; clues left in typical movies. They will starve here.Although I am a huge fan of Hartley's work, I'll be the first to admit that he's not for everyone. It's no surprise at all to me that the critics didn't love the movie, it's very difficult to compartmentalize it in a neat and orderly fashion when you have to sit through five movies a day and regurgitate one-line reviews. And it's no surprise that a lot of viewers didn't like it. Where's the special effects? Where's the machine-gun chattering dialogue? Where's the over-the-top violence and cmaera work of today's Hollywood blockbusters? All are absent, and if that's what you like you'll be sorely disappointed with this. There are a mind-numbingly huge number of movies out there that follow the mould, people shouldn't have trouble finding something they like, but there are prescious few films out there like Hartley's. Maybe that's a good thing, they are all the more appreciated by those who enjoy them.If you found Twin Peaks to be unfathomably boring and The Spanish Prisoner to be rudely unintelligible, stay away from Hartley.

701800,A2ATWKOFJXRRR1,B000066JBR,"B. Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[46, 53]","I can't remember how this film ended up in my hands (maybe a friend recommended it), but I won't ever let it go now. There is endless speculation here at Amazon.com about ""what this films meanings are"", and after viewing it several times, I might (and that's an awfully big ""MIGHT"") be able to add my two cents. But first, let me tell you briefly what this sucker's all about:Beatrice (Sarah Polley), a nobody reporter for an obscure media magnate, is sent to Iceland to speak with the natives of a distant village about their belief that an ancient monster lives in an abandoned missile silo somewhere near their dwellings. On her way to Iceland many strange things happen to Beatrice: her purse gets stolen by a dark and sinister looking female drug addict, shadows lurk around corners, and Beatrice begins to feel that evil is not too far away from her. And she's right. Her plane crashes into the Atlantic Ocean and she is the only survivor. After many, many months of therapy (and going through an oddball spinal operation that involves excruciating pain that causes her to black out), she's finally able to make it to the Icelandic village ...and soon discovers that the monster is REAL!Robert John Burke (Robo Cop 3 and Tombstone) plays the monster who's been around since ""humans crawled out of the primordial ooze."" He's a sarcastic, burned out monster who's only hope is that he'll die one of these millennia and be put out of his misery of watching the human race devour itself. He's an excellent character who you just love listening to, his voice a slow cadence contained within a body who's personality swings from depression to wrath in the blink of an eye. And when Beatrice offers to help him end his life of suffering, he reluctantly agrees to go along with her (nothing has worked up until this point, so the monster has serious doubts that anyone can kill him).When Beatrice brings him back to civilization, a media frenzy ensues. A REAL monster! Newspapers, TV, radio, they're eating it up! But the monster doesn't want any of that. He wants to be away from these gnats of humanity. But even more sinister things are afoot. The military wants to examine him to find out why he's so indestructible. The media wants to make a ""Beauty and the Beast"" story out of him and Beatrice. And terrible people are using their fear of him to do awful things to the monster (like beating him up and peeing on him).Finally, Beatrice finds a scientist who proposes his method of ending the monsters existence. And a rush to end his life before anyone can stop them takes place. Can science really kill our monsters? What happens if you kill off the last monster in the world? Can we live without them?The amazing thing about this film is that it makes you think, laugh, cry, and shiver, often in the same scene. Incredible scripting.So what about my two cents? I think this films main focus is on the monsters in our lives and how we perceive them, and what would happen if we killed them all off. It would change the very fabric of who we are. Could you imagine a world without Dracula? Or Frankenstein? Or that little furry monster that lived under you bed when you were eight years old?  What would happen to us if they never existed in our thoughts and imaginations? Is THAT a more terrible fate than actually having a real one living in an abandoned missile silo?As crazy as this concept may sound, the movie gives implicit meaning to it by showing us Beatrice's encounter with the drugged-out purse stealer, her plane crash, her suffering through horrific pain during spinal surgery, and her eventual understanding of how important some demons are in our lives.A fantastic film.

701801,A141HP4LYPWMSR,B000066JBR,Brian E. Erland,"[6, 7]","According to Plutarch (CE 45-125) the great Goat-God ""Pan is Dead,"" dying just as the Christian faith was taking hold in the Mediterranean world, a classic case of out with the old and in with the new. However what if Plutarch was wrong, what if Pan hadn't died but lived on through the centuries. What if this primal, rural deity remained in the shadows of history quietly observing the advancement of mankind through the ages. What would he think of seeing his beloved wilderness landscape slowly devoured and replaced by large, congested urban centers. Would he be forced into a nomadic existence forever looking for a place of solitude away from the ever curious world of men. If he was seen on occasion would he be revered as in old as a God, or despised and perceived as a monster? What if Pan really did exist?Interesting premise don't you think? Well this is the situation and just some of the questions dealt with in Hal Hartley's amazing dark comedy `No Such Thing' (`01). OK, I admit the film doesn't actually refer to this horned and hairy monster as the legendary Pan but the resemblance is strong and there are definitely subtle implications in the script supporting this view. Anyway, a satyr-like creature is discovered alive and hiding out in a remote region of Iceland. He is isolated, depressed, alcoholic and suicidal. The monster laments, ""I see extinction in everything around me."" He's convinced that only dying can solve his problem. But he can't, he's immortal. This disenfranchised pagan deity now spends his time drinking and terrorizing a nearby village whenever his anger at mankind becomes too much to bear. All seems hopeless until Beatrice a young American journalist convinces him to accompany her back to the U.S.A., giving her the story of the century and providing him with his one and only chance for extinction.`No Such Thing' is one of the most original, off-beat and quirky films you'll ever come across. Hartley's dialogue ranges from inventive to absurd, but always meaningful and layered. Robert John Burke is brilliant as the potty-mouthed Satyr and Sarah Polley is a perfect choice for the clueless Beatrice.

Hartley,"[3, 4]","Director Hal Hartley's subtly arch, deadpan observations on the Human Condition either completely grab you or leave you cold, and ""No Such Thing"" is no exception. Pretty TV news intern Sarah Polley gets her Big Break when she is sent to Iceland to get the ""exclusive"" on a Real Live Monster (Hartley stalwart Robert Burke) an immortal nihilist who kills the boredom by drinking heavily and terrorizing whoever's handy. After her plane goes down en route, her cynical boss (played with relish by Hellen Mirren) smells an even bigger story when Polley winds up as the ""miracle survivor"" of the tragedy. The Monster agrees to come back to N.Y.C. if Polley helps him track down the one scientist in the world who can be his Dr. Kevorkian and put him out of his misery. The pacing in the first half is leisurely yet compelling, with the Monster's morose, raving monologues set against the stark, moody Icelandic backdrop (I was reminded of David Thewliss in ""Naked""). Once the movie heads for New York, however, the story steers closer to satirical camp (a la ""Pecker"") where the couple quickly become celebrities ""du jour"" with the trendy Downtown crowd. The second half feels somewhat rushed, as if Hartley were suddenly forced to edit for time. Puzzlingly, several reviewers see this dip into Mythology as something ""different"" for Hartley, perhaps they've forgotten his ""Book Of Life"", which featured Jesus and Mary wandering around modern-day Manhattan.

She is thrown as a sacrifice into the hands of a horrific monster (Robert John Burke looking a bit like the devil in LEGEND). He turns out to be a wise-cracking, foul-mouthed lout who has been around since the beginning of the planet. He's tired and wants to die.Before the reporter gets to this scenario, however, she has terrifying back surgery to contend with and I cannot fathom why this was tossed into the film. I guess because it is reflected near the end in a scene I will not spoil. This modern take on ""Beauty and the Beast"" is all in all rather silly, but I got a kick out of the walk-on by Helen Mirren as the reporter's nasty NYC boss.Also astonishing is the goofy Dr. Artaud, the genius who is the only one who knows how to destroy the seemingly indestructible nameless monster. Artaud is played by Icelandic writer/director Baltasar Korm&aacute;kur, famed for his excellent JAR CITY (see my review). He reminded me of the real-life mathematician Paul Erdos.On any road, this thing could have been so much more. Even Wallywood in its mainstream could have done better...the story sags, the arc is obvious and rip-offs are tiresome anyway (Beauty and the Beast only gets a story to a limited point). Still, it has its philosophical points of interest and the characters are certainly fun, albeit a bit sketched-in loosely.It may be the release date that is the worry. Released in 2001, I guess not many people got the chance to see or enjoy this, and now only on cable can you sometimes glimpse it. Perhaps there is a message in this film after all, if viewed with post-9-11 eyes.I say it is up to the viewer.

701808,A2BPDFR58H9575,B000066JBR,Galina,"[2, 2]","No Such Thing (2002) was my first Hal Hartley's movie. Checking its site on Netflix when I ordered the DVD, I was intrigued by the viewers' reviews on the very first page that differ from one star to four, and by the Top 10 Lists of the viewers who had seen the film already. The lists included ""Independent does not mean good"", ""Don't Waste Your Stamp"", and the most sincere ""What the heck am I watching?""  I knew that I was going to see a different, controversial, and interesting movie. After I saw it, I was very impressed. I know that I will look for more Hartley's works.As far as the story goes, like many directors before and after him Hal Hartley re-tells the old but immortal legend of Beauty and the Beast which is set in the modern, post 9/11 (even though the movie was made before September 11, 2001)  world. The film is worth watching for many reasons. First, it is visually beautiful and poetic especially the scenes shot in Iceland, mysterious far-away country. It did not surprise me that the monster made the remote Iceland his residence. Second, the music score that Hartley wrote himself was appropriately gripping and disturbing. Third (and very important for me), any movie that would place in one scene two of the greatest actresses of older generation, Helen Mirren and Julie Christie, and young but enormously talented and charismatic Sarah Polley and  let them do the magic of acting together, is a remarkable movie in my book. And the last one, it is the interesting and compelling, satiric and biting retelling of Beauty and the Beast dropped against the frenzy of the modern media hunger for sensations at the time when terrorism is omnipresent.  The film explores the nature of the beast in original, ironic, and clever manner. I guess I can call it a Hartley way.  The bitter, cruel, deadly tired from eternal insomnia and scornful (quite often for good reasons) to human race monster as played by Robert John Burke, is sarcastic, scary, observant  and strangely sympathetic. I would recommend the film and I am sure in case of No Such Thing, independent does mean good.",4,"The nature of the beast: ""I can't go out there and be expected not to kill anybody.""",1337126400,"05 16, 2012",2012,2101,"['Such', 'Thing', '2002', 'was', 'first', 'Hal', 'Hartley', 'movie', 'Checking', 'site', 'Netflix', 'when', 'ordered', 'DVD', 'was', 'intrigued', 'viewers', 'reviews', 'very', 'first', 'page', 'differ', 'one', 'star', 'four', 'Top', '10', 'Lists', 'viewers', 'who', 'had', 'seen', 'film', 'already', 'lists', 'included', 'Independent', 'not', 'mean', 'good', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Waste', 'Stamp', 'most', 'sincere', 'What', 'heck', 'am', 'watching', 'knew', 'was', 'going', 'see', 'different', 'controversial', 'interesting', 'movie', 'saw', 'was', 'very', 'impressed', 'know', 'will', 'look', 'more', 'Hartley', 'works.As', 'far', 'story', 'many', 'directors', 'Hal', 'Hartley', 'old', 'immortal', 'legend', 'Beauty', 'Beast', 'set', 'modern', 'post', '9/11', 'even', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'September', '11', '2001', 'world', 'film', 'worth', 'watching', 'many', 'reasons', 'First', 'visually', 'beautiful', 'poetic', 'especially', 'scenes', 'shot', 'Iceland', 'mysterious', 'far-away', 'country', 'did', 'not', 'surprise', 'monster', 'made', 'remote', 'Iceland', 'residence', 'Second', 'music', 'score', 'Hartley', 'wrote', 'was', 'appropriately', 'gripping', 'disturbing', 'Third', 'very', 'important', 'movie', 'would', 'place', 'one', 'scene', 'two', 'greatest', 'actresses', 'older', 'generation', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'Julie', 'Christie', 'young', 'enormously', 'talented', 'charismatic', 'Sarah', 'Polley', 'let', 'do', 'magic', 'acting', 'together', 'remarkable', 'movie', 'book', 'last', 'one', 'interesting', 'compelling', 'satiric', 'biting', 'retelling', 'Beauty', 'Beast', 'dropped', 'frenzy', 'modern', 'media', 'hunger', 'sensations', 'time', 'when', 'terrorism', 'omnipresent', 'film', 'nature', 'beast', 'original', 'ironic', 'clever', 'manner', 'guess', 'can', 'call', 'Hartley', 'way', 'bitter', 'cruel', 'deadly', 'tired', 'eternal', 'insomnia', 'scornful', 'quite', 'often', 'good', 'reasons', 'human', 'race', 'monster', 'played', 'Robert', 'John', 'Burke', 'sarcastic', 'scary', 'observant', 'strangely', 'sympathetic', 'would', 'recommend', 'film', 'am', 'sure', 'case', 'No', 'Such', 'Thing', 'independent', 'mean', 'good']",No Such Thing

However, ""No Such Thing"" is more cinematic schizophrenia rather than a beauty & the beast fairytale.  There are so many things happening in this film, the sad truth is that they just don't hang together.  Take the lead in the film, Sarah Polley who plays Beatrice.  She is delightfully innocent and gives heart to what otherwise seems a heartless world.  Yet when she returns to New York with the Monster, she parties all night, has casual sex with Carlo, a boy stud, and then gets put in a leather strap dress straight out of a sado-masochistic fantasy.  Why?  She must be schizophrenic.  The wonderful Julie Christie as Dr. Anna works on Beatrice after she is the lone survivor of an airplane crash.  (What the airplane crash and the extensive surgery had to do with the rest of the film, I never understood.)  Then she leaves her surgical practice to go on holiday to the remote part of Iceland with Beatrice.  After going so far, she says goodbye and turns around and leaves.  Why?  Schizophrenia.  The also always marvelous Helen Mirren plays a great cold-blooded news hound boss always looking for an angle to make news.  She barely notices when an entire news crew is murdered and disappears in remote Iceland, but flies the Atlantic to check on Beatrice who she has no clue how long has worked for her.  Why?  Schizophrenia.  Baltasar Kormakur as Dr. Artaud was delightful with his thick little glasses and gives a nice moral at the end about monsters, but the movie as a whole has so many mixed signals that it doesn't work.  The Icelandic scenery was beautiful.  I did also enjoy Robert John Burke's acid-tongued Monster.  All in all, this film is a waste of time and talent.

While all his films have disparate elements that he brings together based on his character's psyches, pulling them into converging situations, here the convergence is much too contrived.The focus is lost because of the presence of too many reasons to make the film--media satire, the stupidity of man as revealed by history, Beauty and the Beast, man's place in the universe, meaningless intellectuals and scientists, et cetera, et cetera.When a young woman reporter (Sarah Polley) finds out her fiance Jim was killed in Iceland, she travels there to find out what happened and encounters a foul-mouthed creature who admits to killing Jim and his colleagues.  The monster speaks perfect English and rants and raves to the reporter about killing a lot of stupid human beings--either that or wanting to die himself.  She convinces him to come with her to New York where he becomes a media darling for a day or two, then is subjected to intense scientific research.  The monster is impervious to bullets and tells the reporter only one man can kill him...This is really Hartley doing a comic book version of his own type of movie.  Too bad, because there are some interesting elements here.  For example, a pre-credit sequence reveals the monster immediately and has him spouting his typical vitriol; this works very well.Aside from the plethora of themes tossed out willy-nilly, there are too many cliches in the film to really make it work.  The dialogue thrown off by Helen Mirren's media boss is much too trite to contribute any real substance and while she's always an excellent actress, she tries hard to make this work and just can't do it.  Similarly, Damian Young's research scientist spews lines that hark back to the dopiest 50s science fiction films.  And the entire sequence when girl and monster first come to NY City is total cliche.Additionally, the reporter was the sole survivor of a jumbo jet crash.  The only reason to include this was to, ostensibly, establish more of a link between her and the monster--i.e., she's a media star for a short time based on freakish events, and he too shares the same brief spotlight because of his freakish appearance.  But this link is much too tenuous; the reporter's survival of the accident really does not add anything to the film at all.For the best Hartley film, see Henry Fool where his control is perfect.

As the opening credits roll, we see the Monster dictating a bitter, cynical, morose message to the world. Afterward, we watch as a pretty, sweet young thing named Beatrice receives the taped monologue. Sarah Polley playing the blond-braided, dewy-eyed ingenue seems like Central Casting's idea of the perfect innocent heroine. I had high hopes for her in her ill-fitting dress and oversize coat bordering on being a cloak. I know Hal Hartley's other movies, and though I would never term them as family-friendly or fairy-tale-like, he does have a penchant for language, symbolism, and allegorical elements. Suitable style for a fairy tale, yes? Unfortunately, the answer is a resounding no.The film tries to tackle the evils of a media-conscious society, the price people put on fame, the corruption of government research, and--cliched as it is--man's inhumanity toward man.Why this diatribe had to be set in Iceland revolving around a girl and a Monster/Beast is beyond me. It's not a modern, hip take on ""Beauty and the Beast."" Robert John Burke who plays the Monster under layers of makeup and special effects does elicit laughs. His take on this creature is to present him as a mad, articulate drunkard who is still verbal enough to goad a bartender into pouring him another drink, even though he's about to get behind the wheel of a Corvette. Imagine Campbell Scott's portrayal of Roger Dodger, but have him morphing physically into Frankenstein. Burke is moderately mencacing, but his Monster is really much more like a pro athlete past his prime who can't retire. The Monster realizes he's obsolete and he's hanging on to his existence.Sarah Polley's characterization begins well. She does seem pristine and brave, virginal and determined. However, with no narrative explanation, she begins to wear leather bondage-style dresses and totally loses connection with her original spirited young lady. Think Ariel the Little Mermaid meets Pamela Anderson Lee. It's a strange transition.For a modern, refreshing, ultimately satisfying fairy tale, rent the DVD of ""Freeway,"" where Reese Witherspoon and Kiefer Sutherland effortlessly and chillingly enact Red Riding Hood and the Big Bad Wolf.

The first scenes with the monster are funny, clever and make you sit up and start hoping for the same level of dialog and scarcasm for the rest of the film.  No such luck.  The girl, Beatrice is one of the most inconsistant and poorly developed characters I have seen.  One scene she is a simplistic young girl who converses with the monster in a very naive manner that disarms the monster's wrath.  The next scene she is moving around hotels in New York like a tramp on holiday.  Very unlikely.

Then throw in a little ""Mighty Joe Young"" banter, ""Beauty and the Beast fashions"", and ""The Song of Bernadette"" for good measure.The film is a stylistic masterpiece and the banter between the beast and Beatrice (Sarah Polley) is surreal comedy at its best. If you enjoy quirky and subtly off-kilter films then the superficial story of ""No Such Thing"" will be a real pleasure in itself. Don't let frustration over the underlying meaning ruin the fun during the first viewing-just go with it.The DVD does not contain a director's commentary so the viewer is left to speculate on just what this thing is really about; what themes Hartley is serious about and to what degree the obvious themes are just there for parody and laughs.My retrospective take is that it is about the interplay of evolution and intelligent design, with the monster an artifact left over from creation. God created the monster, knowing that humankind needs fear for motivation.  He expected us to have evolved beyond fear and hate of each other long before now, creating a need for the monster as a tangible fear factor.  But this did not happen, making the monster irrelevant and God disillusioned with humankind.  Both he and the monster are bored with the stupidity they see.God decides to intervene so the monster can go away and be put out of it's misery. He chooses Beatrice for this mission and she goes through a miracle survival experience to heighten her appreciation for life and to give her a distanced perspective free of fear and hate. Sarah Polley is perfectly cast as Beatrice; her Beatrice is somehow both detached and expressive. If you enjoy Polley you will love this character.Then again, what do I know?

701824,A1J2931UBBJPXM,B000066JBR,Reviewer,"[4, 4]","As individuals, or collectively as a society, what is it, exactly, that we are afraid of?  Since the beginning of time, what has really been behind all those knee-jerk reactions that have brought us to where we are today?  These are the questions posed (and answered) by writer/director Hal Hartley in ""No Such Thing,"" an often biting satire of the news media, the all-to-prevalent-in-our-society tabloid-type mentality and our response to the unknown, be it tangible or imaginary; a film that brings us face to face with fear and confronts it with humor, pathos and Hartley's own insightful and inimitable take on the human condition.Some time after a three-man television news team disappears after being sent to Iceland to investigate reports of a ""monster"" living on a rock island just off the coast, the station receives a tape recording from someone claiming to be the monster himself, describing in graphic detail what he did with those dispatched to find and film him.  ""The Boss (Helen Mirren)"" of the news department, in her quest to give the public the ""worst news"" possible, agrees to send another employee, Beatrice (Sarah Polley), to Iceland to follow up on it, since Beatrice was engaged to the cameraman of the crew gone missing.After a temporary delay due to circumstances beyond her control, Beatrice finally makes it to Iceland, where she has to trek to a remote village on the coast (the final leg of which she has to walk, as even horses can't make it through).  Once there, the locals tell their tales of the ""monster,"" who has apparently always been with them, and point out to her the rock upon which he is purported to live.  And Beatrice finds herself at the point of no return; she has come this far, and now it's just a matter of getting some help from the villagers to get her across the channel to the rock-- and her encounter with this monster who is ""changeless and eternal.""As no one else can, Hal Hartley has crafted and delivered a film that is part ""Beauty and the Beast,"" part ""Frankenstein,"" part ""Forbidden Planet,"" and ALL Hartley.  Unlike most films featuring a ""monster,"" Hartley does not keep his audience in suspense, but reveals his ""man/beast"" at the very beginning, as we see him making the tape he subsequently sends to the T.V. station.  And he's an ugly spud (credit goes to Mark Rappaport for special effects makeup), unique among all of the monsters in cinematic history.  Hartley's creation affects a John Wayne countenance, drinks too much and speaks perfect English (how this can be so is ultimately revealed).  Hartley then layers one unexpected event upon another, using black comedy to present a scathing social commentary, incisively composed through his keen insights into human nature.  The allegory of the tale is concealed in who this monster really is, and what he wants, and it brings to mind Dr. Morbius and the secrets of the Krell.Absent in this film is the trademark cadence Hartley generally has his actors employ through a very deliberate delivery of their lines, and it is missed, as it is one of the elements that makes his films so engaging, creating as it does a fairly hypnotic effect (similar to the method employed by David Mamet in his films).  Still, the Hartley magic is alive and well, and by keeping his volatile monster front and center throughout the film, rather than as a mysterious entity hidden in the shadows to whom he merely alludes, he succeeds in keeping his audience totally involved.  Hartley is also a master of ""thinking outside the box,"" which enables him to offer entirely unique perspectives on the human condition and this thing we call ""life""; you never know where he's going to take you, which is another reason why his films are so engaging (as this one certainly is).  He knows how to make that all-important connection with his audience, but he chooses to do it indirectly, offering thought-provoking scenarios in a way that gives his viewer the option of coming on board or standing by while the ship sails; a kind of ""you can lead a horse to water,"" proposition that most filmmakers would not have the courage to employ.  Keep in mind, though, that once you hit the deck with Hartley, the rewards are many and great.Working with Hartley for the first time, Sarah Polley proves to be a quick study in all things Hartley; in creating Beatrice, she demonstrates an innate grasp of his methods, and most importantly, what it is he is attempting to accomplish through his characters.  And this has to be a challenge to any actor; just as not every actor can work with Woody Allen because of his approach, it would seemingly be difficult with Hartley because of his unique perspectives.  Whatever the case may be, Polley succeeds splendidly, presenting a convincing character who is decidedly all ""Hartley.""Helen Mirren, too, demonstrates her versatility and consummate professionalism by falling into Hartley's rhythms with apparent facility.  The role of ""The Boss"" is something of a departure for Mirren, but she immerses herself in the character with gusto and makes The Boss believable.  And she seems to be enjoying herself immensely in doing so.  A terrific actor, she's a joy to watch in this one.As the monster, Hartley regular Robert John Burke steals the show by creating a monster that is so stunningly atypical; this beast has a fearless swagger and the wisdom of millennia to back it up.  Burke readily conveys his disdain for human beings with terms and a tone that fairly drips with cynicism, and it is in his portrayal that we find both the real humor and the pathos of the film.The supporting cast includes Baltasar Kormakur (Artaud), Julie Christie (Dr. Anna) and Stacy Dawson (Mugger).

This movie seems to want to make this point, but it does so in such an obvious and annoying way that I can't help but see dead horses and big sticks.Sarah Polley and Robert John Burke deliver quality performances.  However, the charactes they play are so contrived and two-dimensional that it's hard to take them seriously.  Add this to the costume designer being held responsible for the changes they go through in New York (she in a Gaultieresque nightmare that would end any stylist's career, and he somehow fitting into an Armani suit and Prada shoes) with no apparent character work to back it up, and we're left with a train wreck of contradictory images that are impossible to justify.I know this is supposed to be a modern fairy tale, but, as with  most fairy tales, the reality of the characters' conflict has to be real.  It is that connection to real life that sustains a fairy tale, and it just isn't there in this film.There are some nice moments in the movie and some amazingly witty lines.

701827,A3DZCNEU21MB6L,B000066JBR,"THowerton ""SHowT""","[2, 2]","What is Hal Hartley's ""No Such Thing""?  A wonderfully weird, subdued, funny and surrealistic modern day fable.  The movie as such involves our protagonist/ heroine Beatrice (played almost blankly by Sarah Polley) who is beset by a variety of odd life situations.  She begins as the woman who has seemingly lost her fiancee to his death at the hands of some Shakespearian monster.  Despite being employed by a facilic news magazine she manages to convince her boss to send her out to find out the story behind her fiancee's disappearance.  On her quest her flight is downed over the ocean and all survivors are deemed lost.  But Beatrice by some miracle survives and is hauled out of the water.  She is broken and bruised and may never be able to walk again until surgeons come in and say that a procedure, one that would require her to be awake during the operation and that itself could kill her, could help her walk again with a successful surgery.  Without poring over it much Beatrice agrees and goes through the painful experience; she blacks out during it.  However, she survives and within a year she has made remarkable progress and can walk again.  At this time she has been abandoned by her employer and so, in continuing her journey, continues it through the kindness of strangers (in Iceland no less).  She ends up at the village in this far off land where a handful of people live in vigilance and fear of the monster and they tell her tales and they...get her drunk...and they then essentially offer her as a sacrifice to the beast.  This is roughly the first half of the movie.  The latter half finds Beatrice getting to know the beast (masterfully played by Robert John Burke, probably best known as Bart Bass in the TV series ""Gossip Girl""), a mythologic creature who suffers insomnia and wild, damning headaches and who if he is to be believed has been around almost since the beginning of the world.  The beast is beastly: he terrorizes people; he's generally a grouch; he kills people; he's a drunk; he's a loner; and he's contemptuous of humanity.  Oh, and he's immortal.  This immortality is the bane of his existence as he wishes to die.  Though he can't die he has found one man, a scientist who is also a bit of a lunatic, who knows how to kill him.  So Beatrice, having sympathy for this poor soul, suffers his rages and promises him that she will help him find the scientist so that he can be put out of his misery.  Death with dignity and all that.  The two then go on their quest and overcome their obstacles, including the beast being duped and becoming the subject of military experiments that cause him excruciating agony and from which he cannot die, until they abscond with the lunatic scientist who does his thing and sets the beast up to die.  Beatrice kisses him just prior to his execution.  And, as the execution commences, the screen goes dark and so ends this movie that will make many people scream and rip their hair out at this point.Wonderfully filmed and acted (some of the actors chew their scenery as if they are characters out of a comic strip while others, such as Julie Christie's Dr. Anna, are warm and calm and even understated) this movie is not about spelling anything out for you.  It is a story with a variety of elements thrown in and it lets you determine what it all means.  After watching it (I enjoyed it and found it thought provoking while my wife said that she wished she could get that two hours of her life back) one of the things that puzzled me was why half of the movie was devoted to Beatrice's journey and the oddities thereof.  This has led me to my conclusions about what I think this film is about.  Read on if you want to know!The name of Beatrice means something to the effect of ""voyager through life"".  That our heroine certainly was: a voyager or traveler.  She didn't present with a sense of knowing her destination and the story gave us essentially nothing in regards to her origin.  For all intents and purposes she ""is"".  And she is also our ""everyman"" and perhaps the epitome of humanity at or near its humanistically proposed apex: a being of conscience, care, and concern who holds no misplaced malice or serviceable judgment against that which is different or even ought not to be, or for that which is artifice.  Beatrice is the angelic version of humanity, gilded with a divinity in and of itself, and not a divinity that is transferred onto it by that which is not or is unreal (such as God).  [Mind you, these are my thoughts about what I think the movie is getting at.  I am not saying that I believe this hogwash.]  The purpose of the first half of the movie is to establish a couple of things: (1) the person of Beatrice, a woman who is open to the world and life's journey and is not interested in controlling it but is also sympathetic to the needs of what amounts to stark difference, to that which can not be (otherwise known as ""the beast""), and to not hold it in contempt but to value it enough that she is able to let it pass on under its own authority and need to do so and (2) having Beatrice go through so many odd, coincidental, horrific, and even disillusioning events and yet still come out unchanged in spirit and undaunted in current purpose (seeking to find out what happened to her betrothed--someone whom we never feel she felt especially warm or attached to) may be a metaphor for humankind going through its lifespan and surviving wild, cataclysmic events and yet still coming out of them essentially unchanged in spirit and undaunted in current purpose (for the humanist that would be in humankind's ever-upward-evolution toward our fulfillment in magnanimousness).  Beatrice's journey, fraught with wild peril and helped in unparralleled fashion, was extremely important to show in that it gave a sense of mankind's internal divinity and ability to survive and overcome.  (As I said, this is a modern day fable.)The character of ""the beast"", this immortal and mythological creature who has watched us ""climb up out of the primordial ooze"" and who has terrorized and ultimately grown tired of us throughout the ages, seems to characterize man's artificial attempts to create meaning and purposes for our lives.  This would include the summation of the world's religions and philosophies under its umbrella of erroneous beliefs.  These beliefs, then, are not to be judged or to be rejected.  No.  And Beatrice does not judge the beast (who killed her fiancee and friends) and she does not reject him (she won't run away from him and attempts to soothe and understand him and she listens to his rants).  But what of these beliefs, these affronts to the humanistic idea of the insular divinity of man?  Well, mankind at its apex is magnanimous and so will allow these beliefs to be/ remain if they should choose or to die if they should recognize their inadequacy, their obsolescence, their non-reality.  And what do we find Beatrice, that angelic virtue of humanism, do with the beast who is pained more and more by the ever-increasing noise of ""information"" and who cannot die, who cannot kill himself?  She helps him find the one (I would underline that one if I could) answer, the one thing that can kill him, the one salvation: science (in the form of the lunatic scientist who spouses metaphysical mumbo jumbo).  Yes!  Science!  That bastion of all things that are real!  That noble endeavor that mankind can turn to and find ultimate answers and ultimate truth in (as long as you include a healthy does of humanism too)!  Science can kill off that which is not real nor ever was (religion and a variety of other philosophies).  And it can do so, under the guidance of humanism, without disdain.  (As I mentioned before it's a mercy killing really.)And, finally, why does the film end in the fashion it does (without it showing us the actual successful annihilation of the beast or without it showing us what becomes of Beatrice)?  It is because it is for us to decide.  Humanistically speaking, humanism isn't going to force itself on anyone.  We can keep the beast alive (and along with it all of our religious and philosophical beliefs and prejudices) or we can believe that he has died.  We can learn from Beatrice, and show mercy, compassion, and love to even the hideous and non-real or we can choose to believe that she went back to work for her gossip magazine.  It is up to us.  That's one thing this movie gets right.  A great movie for its ingenious presentation of some very thought provoking subject matter in a modern fable that still keeps us entertained along the way.  This is probably one of Joseph Campbell's favorite movies of all time.  I wonder what he thinks it's about?P.S.  If you read all of this?
