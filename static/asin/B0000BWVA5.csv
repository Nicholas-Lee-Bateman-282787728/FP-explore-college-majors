770984,A19RAJY6R7USN0,B0000BWVA5,"Lee Neville ""emotionboy""","[12, 12]","Hosted by the two moose from BROTHER BEAR, Disney's Sing Along Songs On My Way has jokes and songs galore- some of which I actually found quite funny.One reason people buy Sing Along Songs is to see and hear songs from the newest Disney animated feature that they can't yet buy. In this case, this DVD was released when BROTHER BEAR was in movie theaters, and it features the two best songs ""On My Way"" (very catchy!) and ""Welcome.""Other songs include ""Try Again"" (101 DALMATIONS II), ""Following The Leader"" (PETER PAN)- previously released on other Disney's Sing Along Songs DVDs and videos ""Go The Distance"" (HERCULES), I'm Still Here (TREASURE PLANET), ""Digga Tunnah"" (THE LION KING 1/2), ""On The Open Road"" (A GOOFY MOVIE) - previously released on other Disney's Sing Along Songs DVDs and videos, and Aloha E Komo Mai from STITCH! THE MOVIE.Bonuses include dance tracks, word games, karaoke tracks to really test your voices, and an opportunity to hear new jokes from the original voices of the BROTHER BEAR moose.This is actually one of my favorite Sing Along Songs despite the pacing being a little slow with the moose on some occasions. I suggest if you just wanna sing the songs, after hearing the moose once, skip them.",4,Jokes And Songs Galore,1123632000,"08 10, 2005",2005,1228,"['Hosted', 'two', 'moose', 'BROTHER', 'BEAR', 'Disney', 'Sing', 'Along', 'Songs', 'My', 'Way', 'jokes', 'songs', 'galore-', 'actually', 'found', 'quite', 'funny.One', 'reason', 'people', 'buy', 'Sing', 'Along', 'Songs', 'see', 'hear', 'songs', 'newest', 'Disney', 'animated', 'feature', 'ca', ""n't"", 'yet', 'buy', 'case', 'DVD', 'was', 'released', 'when', 'BROTHER', 'BEAR', 'was', 'movie', 'theaters', 'two', 'best', 'songs', 'Way', 'very', 'catchy', 'Welcome', 'Other', 'songs', 'include', 'Try', 'Again', '101', 'DALMATIONS', 'II', 'Following', 'Leader', 'PETER', 'PAN', 'previously', 'released', 'other', 'Disney', 'Sing', 'Along', 'Songs', 'DVDs', 'videos', 'Go', 'Distance', 'HERCULES', ""'m"", 'Still', 'Here', 'TREASURE', 'PLANET', 'Digga', 'Tunnah', 'LION', 'KING', '1/2', 'Open', 'Road', 'GOOFY', 'MOVIE', 'previously', 'released', 'other', 'Disney', 'Sing', 'Along', 'Songs', 'DVDs', 'videos', 'Aloha', 'E', 'Komo', 'Mai', 'STITCH', 'THE', 'MOVIE.Bonuses', 'include', 'dance', 'tracks', 'word', 'games', 'karaoke', 'tracks', 'really', 'test', 'voices', 'opportunity', 'hear', 'new', 'jokes', 'original', 'voices', 'BROTHER', 'BEAR', 'moose.This', 'actually', 'one', 'favorite', 'Sing', 'Along', 'Songs', 'pacing', 'being', 'little', 'slow', 'moose', 'occasions', 'suggest', 'just', 'wan', 'na', 'sing', 'songs', 'hearing', 'moose', 'once', 'skip']",N/A
