970749,A2DOHZDAHOCQ06,B000E97HUS,"Amazon Customer ""s_l_c""","[0, 0]","It is more common to get a movie with good technical execution but with no story.  In New York Doll, we get a great and wonderful story about nastalgia intermixed with personal change.Arthur, interestingly clings to his early years when he was a member of the New York Dolls.  Even though he is over 50 years old he still longs to get back to those days when he was playing music in the band.Having watched the movie, I realize that we all long for something nastalgic.  We want to live in simpler or happier times.  We tend to remember the ""best of"" our early lives.At one point in the film, Authur mentions that he is just there to make other people happy.  It never really was about him.  He is portrayed in this film as a happy gentle man who get what he was wishing for.The editing is at times choppy and perhaps a little disconnected, but the story holds it all together.  To be fair, it's really hard to judge the editing because we don't really know what footage was available to the director.  For example, he mentioned that one of the first calls he got was that Arthur (the subject of the story,) was going to the pawn shop to get his guitar.  The director (and apparently cameraman) said, ""Do you mind if I come along and shoot this.""  Given that context, it's hard to find fault because you wouldn't have a separate angle to edit in, no formal audio equipment.  Given those constraints, the editing is probably really good.",5,Excellent story.

970753,A2NX99GVAX4TRP,B000E97HUS,"Christopher J. Jarmick ""Word  Lover""","[24, 24]","Glam,punk rockers The New York Dolls became more popular and influential after their two studio albums and break-up in 1975--then when they were in their prime.They inspired a varied group of musicians -- some of whom (Chrissy Hynde, Iggy Pop, Morrissey, Bob Geldorf appear on camera here).The most famous band member is musician/actor David Johansen who became better known as Buster Poindexter for many years.This documentary is about another original member, Charles 'Killer' Kane- the base player who faded into neary poverty, drug and alcohol addiction and obscurity shortly after the band broke up.Greg Whiteley, a devout Mormon and aspiring film-maker began making ""New York Doll"" a couple of years after he met one of his Mormon brothers, Arthur Kane who quickly explained he was once known as `Killer' Kane the bassist for the legendary punk rock band, New York Dolls. In a truth-is-stranger-than-fiction development, Kane got wind of a rumor that what he had prayed for nearly 30 years to happen----The New York Dolls were going to re-unite.Wait a minute 'Killer Kane' wound up an LDS member?  Yep.When several of Kane's congregational members raised $300 dollars and gave it to him to get his old bass guitars out of hock at the pawn-shop, Greg Whiteley decided to grab a camera and start filming what was going on. At the very least Arthur Kane was a unique interesting individual that would make a good subject for a documentary even if the re-union of the Dolls did not happen.Whitely was absolutely right, his documentary New York Doll, an intimate portrait of Arthur Kane and a brief history of the New York Dolls, does indeed make a fascinating, surprisingly touching and moving documentary.""Killer' Kane, the statuesque tall bassist for the outrageous New York Dolls a quiet, humble born-again religious librarian?It's hard to believe that the soft spoken, white shirt and tie wearing, Arthur Kane who we meet riding a series of busses to get to work was once a punk glam boy. It's hard to believe that Morrissey invited the Dolls to re-unite for his 2004 Meltdown Festival in London. We learn that Morrissey was an avid fan and almost an all out groupie of the New York Dolls when he was 13 years old.It's also hard to believe that the three surviving members of the Dolls mostly in their early 50s would get back together again and be able to create music truly worth listening to without completely embarrassing themselves.We get a concise history of the Dolls and learn about their influence from Chrissie Hynde, Bob Geldoff, Mick Jones (of the Clash) and Morrissey. The Dolls (and Bowie's Ziggy Stardust band) broke through the formulaic heavy metal (with their ten minute drum solos) and dull progressive rock bands (with their ten minute synthesizer solos). They created some excellent songs (sounding like something Green Day would release today) while wearing platform heels, tight leather pants, huge hair, mascara, lipstick and swatches of material that transformed them into disheveled transvestite hookers.So did Arthur Kane's dream of a reuniting with David Johansen and Sylvain Sylvain actually happen? Was it a huge success, a pleasant bit of nostalgia or an utter embarrassment? Did Arthur say prayers before going on stage? Did he patch up the feud and bitter feelings he had about David?This is the bitter-sweet story about what happened. Since it is about one of the most outrageous punk rock bands from the 70s, trying to explain this is a `bittersweet' story is an ironic challenge.This is not a VH1 Behind the Music kind of profile. It is much more than that. It is a tender but honest portrait of an extremely fragile human being--Arthur Kane. Sure I wish we would have heard and seen a bit more music than we do in the movie, but you can buy the albums for that.The film will touch you. The story is sad, but strangely uplifting.The film is very short (only 78 minutes) and the DVD has a few extras--like an 8 minute interview with the producer/director and a long interview (part of which is used in the film) with Morrisey. Unfortunately we don't get to see any full length performances of the Dolls--but don't let that stop you for a moment from watching this stranger than fiction documentary.It is rated PG-13 because of some strong language.",5,Short Touching Musician Bio-Pic,1148860800,"05 29, 2006",2006,4290,"['Glam', 'punk', 'rockers', 'New', 'York', 'Dolls', 'became', 'more', 'popular', 'influential', 'two', 'studio', 'albums', 'break-up', '1975', 'then', 'when', 'were', 'prime.They', 'inspired', 'varied', 'group', 'musicians', 'whom', 'Chrissy', 'Hynde', 'Iggy', 'Pop', 'Morrissey', 'Bob', 'Geldorf', 'appear', 'camera', 'here', '.The', 'most', 'famous', 'band', 'member', 'musician/actor', 'David', 'Johansen', 'who', 'became', 'better', 'known', 'Buster', 'Poindexter', 'many', 'years.This', 'documentary', 'original', 'member', 'Charles', ""'Killer"", 'Kane-', 'base', 'player', 'who', 'faded', 'neary', 'poverty', 'drug', 'alcohol', 'addiction', 'obscurity', 'shortly', 'band', 'broke', 'up.Greg', 'Whiteley', 'devout', 'Mormon', 'aspiring', 'film-maker', 'began', 'making', 'New', 'York', 'Doll', 'couple', 'years', 'met', 'one', 'Mormon', 'brothers', 'Arthur', 'Kane', 'who', 'quickly', 'explained', 'was', 'once', 'known', 'Killer', 'Kane', 'bassist', 'legendary', 'punk', 'rock', 'band', 'New', 'York', 'Dolls', 'truth-is-stranger-than-fiction', 'development', 'Kane', 'got', 'wind', 'rumor', 'what', 'had', 'prayed', 'nearly', '30', 'years', 'happen', 'New', 'York', 'Dolls', 'were', 'going', 're-unite.Wait', 'minute', 'Kane', 'wound', 'LDS', 'member', 'Yep.When', 'several', 'Kane', 'congregational', 'members', 'raised', '300', 'dollars', 'gave', 'get', 'old', 'bass', 'hock', 'pawn-shop', 'Greg', 'Whiteley', 'decided', 'grab', 'camera', 'start', 'filming', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'very', 'least', 'Arthur', 'Kane', 'was', 'unique', 'interesting', 'individual', 'would', 'make', 'good', 'subject', 'documentary', 'even', 're-union', 'Dolls', 'did', 'not', 'happen.Whitely', 'was', 'absolutely', 'right', 'documentary', 'New', 'York', 'Doll', 'intimate', 'portrait', 'Arthur', 'Kane', 'brief', 'history', 'New', 'York', 'Dolls', 'indeed', 'make', 'fascinating', 'surprisingly', 'touching', 'moving', 'documentary', 'Killer', 'Kane', 'statuesque', 'tall', 'bassist', 'outrageous', 'New', 'York', 'Dolls', 'quiet', 'humble', 'born-again', 'religious', 'librarian', 'hard', 'believe', 'soft', 'spoken', 'white', 'shirt', 'tie', 'wearing', 'Arthur', 'Kane', 'who', 'meet', 'riding', 'series', 'busses', 'get', 'work', 'was', 'once', 'punk', 'glam', 'boy', 'hard', 'believe', 'Morrissey', 'invited', 'Dolls', 're-unite', '2004', 'Meltdown', 'Festival', 'London', 'learn', 'Morrissey', 'was', 'avid', 'fan', 'almost', 'out', 'groupie', 'New', 'York', 'Dolls', 'when', 'was', '13', 'years', 'old.It', 'also', 'hard', 'believe', 'three', 'surviving', 'members', 'Dolls', 'mostly', 'early', '50s', 'would', 'get', 'back', 'together', 'again', 'be', 'able', 'create', 'music', 'truly', 'worth', 'listening', 'completely', 'embarrassing', 'themselves.We', 'get', 'concise', 'history', 'Dolls', 'learn', 'influence', 'Chrissie', 'Hynde', 'Bob', 'Geldoff', 'Mick', 'Jones', 'Clash', 'Morrissey', 'Dolls', 'Bowie', 'Ziggy', 'Stardust', 'band', 'broke', 'formulaic', 'heavy', 'metal', 'ten', 'minute', 'drum', 'solos', 'dull', 'progressive', 'rock', 'bands', 'ten', 'minute', 'synthesizer', 'solos', 'created', 'excellent', 'songs', 'sounding', 'something', 'Green', 'Day', 'would', 'release', 'today', 'wearing', 'platform', 'heels', 'tight', 'leather', 'pants', 'huge', 'hair', 'mascara', 'lipstick', 'swatches', 'material', 'transformed', 'disheveled', 'transvestite', 'hookers.So', 'did', 'Arthur', 'Kane', 'dream', 'reuniting', 'David', 'Johansen', 'Sylvain', 'Sylvain', 'actually', 'happen', 'Was', 'huge', 'success', 'pleasant', 'bit', 'nostalgia', 'utter', 'embarrassment', 'Did', 'Arthur', 'say', 'prayers', 'going', 'stage', 'Did', 'patch', 'up', 'feud', 'bitter', 'feelings', 'had', 'David', 'bitter-sweet', 'story', 'what', 'happened', 'one', 'most', 'outrageous', 'punk', 'rock', 'bands', '70s', 'trying', 'explain', 'bittersweet', 'story', 'ironic', 'challenge.This', 'not', 'VH1', 'Music', 'kind', 'profile', 'much', 'more', 'tender', 'honest', 'portrait', 'extremely', 'fragile', 'human', 'being', 'Arthur', 'Kane', 'Sure', 'wish', 'would', 'have', 'heard', 'seen', 'bit', 'more', 'music', 'do', 'movie', 'can', 'buy', 'albums', 'that.The', 'film', 'will', 'touch', 'story', 'sad', 'strangely', 'uplifting.The', 'film', 'very', 'short', 'only', '78', 'minutes', 'DVD', 'few', 'extras', '8', 'minute', 'interview', 'producer/director', 'long', 'interview', 'part', 'used', 'film', 'Morrisey', 'Unfortunately', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'see', 'full', 'length', 'performances', 'Dolls', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'stop', 'moment', 'watching', 'stranger', 'fiction', 'documentary.It', 'rated', 'PG-13', 'strong', 'language']",New York Doll
970754,A3J5UO5QMTFSWB,B000E97HUS,"Connoisseur Rat ""armchair experientialist""","[4, 4]","As the opening scenes of ""New York Doll"" unfold, we hear the Johnny Thunders-penned classic ""You Can't Put Your Arms Around A Memory,"" in which the lyric cautions: ""You can't put your arms around a memory, so don't try.""  Well, I for one am sure glad the filmmakers didn't give in to that particular notion, because this brisk and uplifting film lovingly puts its arms around the remnants of a once-great band and firmly pulls them into the present, where they are rendered just as glorious as ever (if not moreso).The film picks up the story of the washed up ex-legend Arthur ""Killer"" Kane, nearly 30 years removed from his rock n roll glory days.  He's seen and survived all kinds of abuse (self-inflicted and otherwise) but now has achieved a modicum of peace as a Mormon Church librarian.  But when he receives word that his old band will be reforming for a huge show at London's Royal Albert Hall at rock star Morrissey's bequest, we are able to follow him as he embarks upon a once-in-a-lifetime journey of closure and compassion, living a dream long unfulfilled.This movie works both as a ""rockumentary"" for New York Dolls fans (with great archival footage, as grainy as the beer-soaked memories themselves) and as a beautiful (and often funny) human drama of reconciliation and redemption.For extras, the DVD features a 6-minute interview with the film's likeable director Greg Whiteley (also a Mormon, who met Kane at church), in which he reveals, ""What we didn't want to do was make a VH1 Behind the Music...a rockumentary...because we just felt like something else happened here.""  Mission accomplished, I would say.Also bonus-featured is an interesting, expanded 18-minute interview with Morrissey, who's always good for a quote or three.  He talks about being neighbors with Arthur long before the film was even conceived and having heart to hearts with the man about his sad and embittered life experiences and the ""unlucky, blighted and cursed"" legacy of the New York Dolls.  In addition, he recounts how he was able to convince and cajole both David Johansen (a long-reluctant holdout) and Arthur himself to reunite the New York Dolls for Morrissey's Meltdown festival.Finally, we get a nice, little two-minute hymn where Johansen (accompanied by Brian Koonin on acoustic guitar) sings ""Come, Come Ye Saints"" and sounds like a latter day Tom Waits.All in all, a wonderful DVD.

970756,AL9HZLZT4X1KL,B000E97HUS,CV Rick,"[12, 12]","There is a reason that this movie is getting high praise.  It's not the camera work, which is amateurish at best.  It's not the careful planning, because if there ever was a case of a filmmaker stumbling on a perfect story, this is it.  What makes this film so good is absolute honesty framing a near perfect story.When I first started this dvd I was leery.  It started with this guy, Arthur Kane, a stuttering former musician with a mostly failed life.  He had achieved a level of acceptance as a convert to the Mormon Church which led to a simple life.  As an employee of the Church at the Family History Center, he was leading a quiet life, a friendly life with people around him who accepted him for being Arthur and had no idea that he'd been the bass guitarist for the New York Dolls, the original glam-rock band.  In his music days he was a hard-drinking wild dressing rock star with a penchant for excitement and a taste for the illicit.As I said, I was leery.  As a former Mormon, I was immediately suspect as the filmmaker included interviews with church authorities and Arthur's home teachers (as it turns out, the filmmaker himself was one of Arthur's home teachers, which explains his ""right place at the right time"" success in making a powerful documentary).  Arthur stuttered through his explanations of his previous life and his conversion.  He seemed unsure about everything in his life, an unlikely hero in any story much less his own.But that changed with the revelation that Arthur was to go to a reunion concert in London being organized by Morrisey (formerly of the Smiths, now solo).  Then we see Arthur revealing his history and discussing his anxiousness at being reunited with former bandmate and estranged friend David Johansen.  Interviews proceed throughout by friends from the seventies, musicians who admired the Dolls and Arthur, and even his ex-wife whom he had beaten with cat furniture in a drunken rage before attempting suicide.I admit that I got wrapped up in the movie and forgot all my trepidations, left behind with my own anxiety for Arthur ""Killer"" Kane.  He hadn't played guitar in years and even had to borrow money to get his instruments out of perpetual hock at a local pawn shop.  Would he be able to get into form, would he still ""have it,"" would the tensions of reuniting be the major story, and would they actually get onto stage in London?  All these questions became foremost in my mind, with Arthur's faith and the film making itself forgotten, just part of the scenery as it should be.I can't really tell you any more, because it'll give away too much of a powerful story.

It was a case of life imitating art with bassist Arthur Kane struggling with the pressures of rock 'n' roll mostly through alcohol.  After many years of wandering in relative obscurity Kane found inner peace through his membership in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints.  Kane found as much personal satisfaction schlepping on a L.A. bus to his job at the Mormon library than he did pounding the stage with a high profile glam-rock band.  Kane never lost the desire to reunite with his former bandmates and entertain the masses.  Throughout the history of rock there have many examples of performers attempting to reconcile the profound with the seemingly profane, Elvis and Bob Dylan coming to mind.  I can't recall it captured more poignantly or succinctly as in ""New York Doll"".  The events captured in the film would seemingly be the result of divine intervention.  Is it mere coincidence that Morrissey happened to be in L.A., where Kane lived in relative obscurity, at the same time both were trying to facilitate a Dolls reunion?  I was also touched by the reserved Kane making peace with the extroverted lead singer David Johansen whom he had previously had an uneasy relationship.  The tribute to Kane by Johansen and guitarist Sylvain Sylvain over the closing credits was also moving.

Kane, now a Mormon working at a local library, having given up on music, is barely making ends meet. One day he's confronted by Morrissey, who asks him to come to London to perform with David and Sylvain, the only other survivors of the band New York Dolls. He somewhat hesitantly agrees. He's obviously haunted by his musical past.The second half of this documentary focuses on Kane meeting up with the Dolls who now have a replacement drummer and lead guitarist (Johnny and Jerry were both sadly deceased by this point). As they practice for the upcoming reunion gig, Kane gets nervous but he still has that spark that makes him a legendary bass guitarist.Then comes the show itself. Fans cheer as the band comes out and plays Jet Boy while scenes of the band in 1973 flash on the screen. This part almost had me in tears. After the show, fans approach Kane and give him their thanks and compliments.Then as Kane debates whether or not to renew his musical career, the worst possible thing happens. Kane develops leukemia, and dies shortly after.While the Dolls went on after Kane's death, he'll never be forgotten. He was a vital part of the Dolls that can't be replaced.

Throughout this film, he comes across as a gentle, kind, wryly funny man who'd achieved some peace and tranquility in his life. Save for one unfinished piece of business - making amends with David Johansen and playing on stage with the N.Y. Dolls one more time. That Morrissey managed to reunite the band, and give Arthur the chance to live his unfulfilled dream, is very moving. Arthur sitting in a hotel room in England, marveling at the furniture and the comfort of the room, shows a man who had come to inhabit a state of gratitude. That he returned from that triumphant gig and passed on two weeks later is not nearly as sad as you might think. You can truly say he died a happy man, at peace with himself and the world.

The Mormon faith helped him overcome his troubles (bad home life, alcohol, etc.) but he still clung to the past, hoping against hope that somehow he could reunite with the Dolls.  Morissey plays a strange role in this, helping him reunite with the surviving Dolls and in fact, getting them back together.This is a story about hope, about overcoming hardships, finding your passions, and resolution of the past.

970765,AGVWTYW0ULXHT,B000E97HUS,"Nathan Andersen ""Gadget lover and author of S...","[14, 16]","This film is definitely worth watching for its remarkable story that ties together two American phenomena that are seemingly unreconcilable: Mormonism and New York glam/rock/punk.  Arthur ""Killer"" Kane of the New York Dolls joined the Mormon Church sometime after the band broke up (upon the death of two of its members).  He gets the chance to go back, and performs in a remarkable reunion concert organized by Morrissey (of the Smiths, a big fan of the Dolls).  Somebody had the foresight to capture this comeback on film, and to document this intriguing life from the perspective both of the fans and friends of the band and from the perspective of the Mormon community he had joined.What makes the film less stellar than it might be is the amateurish cinematography (nobody told the cameraman that overuse of the ""zoom"" function tends to be annoying, and mostly dropped out even from the ""rockumentary"" genre in the 70's), and the ponderous editing.  The recording of the few hours before the concert, which should have been filled with tension, excitement and reflection, was a bit ponderous and boring due to the filmmakers' awkward efforts at building an artificial tension -- every 10 minutes it would say ""40 minutes before the concert ... 30 minutes before on stage ..."" and he would ask Arthur something like ""are you nervous"" and Arthur would say something like ""Not really .."" -- the tension and excitement in Arthur that was apparent came out in spite of all this.  The unnecessarily prolonged (not because awkward moments should be avoided at all costs but because the filmmakers don't appear to have given careful enough thought to what they wanted to achieve and how best to tell the story they wanted) moments like these tended to undercut the power of a few really interesting scenes like the prayer that Arthur said right before the concert and the reactions of the various crew and band members.  While their access to subjects for interviews was remarkable, the filmmakers tended to ask questions that didn't strike me as the most relevant -- and that also betrayed their inexperience with the punk rock/glam rock scene to which the New York Dolls belonged, and suggested they were much more clearly at home in and understanding of the Mormon community.  An exceptional scene of the band playing and singing a classic Mormon hymn was saved for halfway through the credits, when it could have instead leant extraordinary impact to the closing moments of the film.  These and similar moments betray the inexperience of the filmmakers in ways that detracted from the story for me.Having said that, I am grateful to the filmmakers for having captured on film a very intriguing story that is well worth telling and that I enjoyed watching.  I would rather see an amateurish documentary like this with an intriguing subject than the loads of professionally polished but uninspiring cinema that gets dumped on the cineplexes every week.",3,"Exceptional story and subject, great access, marred by so-so cinematography and editing",1147305600,"05 11, 2006",2006,2951,"['film', 'definitely', 'worth', 'watching', 'remarkable', 'story', 'together', 'two', 'American', 'phenomena', 'are', 'seemingly', 'unreconcilable', 'Mormonism', 'New', 'York', 'glam/rock/punk', 'Arthur', 'Killer', 'Kane', 'New', 'York', 'Dolls', 'joined', 'Mormon', 'Church', 'sometime', 'band', 'broke', 'up', 'death', 'two', 'members', 'chance', 'go', 'back', 'performs', 'remarkable', 'reunion', 'concert', 'organized', 'Morrissey', 'Smiths', 'big', 'fan', 'Dolls', 'Somebody', 'had', 'foresight', 'capture', 'comeback', 'film', 'document', 'intriguing', 'life', 'perspective', 'fans', 'friends', 'band', 'perspective', 'Mormon', 'community', 'had', 'joined.What', 'film', 'less', 'stellar', 'might', 'be', 'amateurish', 'cinematography', 'nobody', 'told', 'cameraman', 'overuse', 'zoom', 'function', 'be', 'annoying', 'mostly', 'dropped', 'out', 'even', 'rockumentary', 'genre', '70', 'ponderous', 'editing', 'recording', 'few', 'hours', 'concert', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'filled', 'tension', 'excitement', 'reflection', 'was', 'bit', 'ponderous', 'boring', 'due', 'filmmakers', 'awkward', 'efforts', 'building', 'artificial', 'tension', '10', 'minutes', 'would', 'say', '40', 'minutes', 'concert', '30', 'minutes', 'stage', 'would', 'ask', 'Arthur', 'something', 'are', 'nervous', 'Arthur', 'would', 'say', 'something', 'Not', 'really', '..', 'tension', 'excitement', 'Arthur', 'was', 'apparent', 'came', 'out', 'spite', 'unnecessarily', 'prolonged', 'not', 'awkward', 'moments', 'should', 'be', 'avoided', 'costs', 'filmmakers', 'do', ""n't"", 'appear', 'have', 'given', 'careful', 'enough', 'thought', 'what', 'wanted', 'achieve', 'how', 'best', 'tell', 'story', 'wanted', 'moments', 'tended', 'undercut', 'power', 'few', 'really', 'interesting', 'scenes', 'prayer', 'Arthur', 'said', 'right', 'concert', 'reactions', 'various', 'crew', 'band', 'members', 'access', 'subjects', 'interviews', 'was', 'remarkable', 'filmmakers', 'tended', 'ask', 'questions', 'did', ""n't"", 'strike', 'most', 'relevant', 'also', 'betrayed', 'inexperience', 'punk', 'rock/glam', 'rock', 'scene', 'New', 'York', 'Dolls', 'belonged', 'suggested', 'were', 'much', 'more', 'clearly', 'home', 'understanding', 'Mormon', 'community', 'exceptional', 'scene', 'band', 'playing', 'singing', 'classic', 'Mormon', 'hymn', 'was', 'saved', 'halfway', 'credits', 'when', 'could', 'have', 'instead', 'leant', 'extraordinary', 'impact', 'closing', 'moments', 'film', 'similar', 'moments', 'inexperience', 'filmmakers', 'ways', 'detracted', 'story', 'me.Having', 'said', 'am', 'grateful', 'filmmakers', 'having', 'captured', 'film', 'very', 'intriguing', 'story', 'well', 'worth', 'telling', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'would', 'rather', 'see', 'amateurish', 'documentary', 'intriguing', 'subject', 'loads', 'professionally', 'polished', 'uninspiring', 'cinema', 'dumped', 'cineplexes', 'week']",New York Doll

If you are reading this then you probably already know about the story of Arthur Kane.The film is wonderfully done. Music, personality, religion and pathos are all juxtaposed in a very entertaining manner. Arthur Kane is depicted as a sad but very humble and open person.When the New York Dolls finally play in their reunion show, the film ""ping pongs"" between an old performance and new performance making you see how the members, especialy Kane, have changed.The film allows the viewer to learn so much about Kane and develop a caring about him as a person ( as opposed to rock and roll star) that the revelation of his untimely death creates a lot of emotion in the viewer.
