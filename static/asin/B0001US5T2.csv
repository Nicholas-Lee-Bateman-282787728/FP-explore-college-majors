I was finally able to get my hands on a copy and let me tell you it was well worth the wait and buy. This movie was done different then the B.I.G. movie in more of a documentary form rather than a movie form. They did not have someone play Tupac the character but they had people talking throughout the movie and highlights of his life. One thing that I really liked was they touched on his mother a lot and how she was a part of the Blank Panther movement. I liked this because it went outside of his story and brought his family into it. They touched on numerous times in this movie how inspirational his mother was. Tupac pointed out if it wasn't for his mother he would not be the same person he turned out to be. I thought they covered his life pretty good in this movie. Going all the way back to the days of him just starting rapping. It's funny and I never realized this once he never got in trouble until he became a rapper. He said he tried dealing drugs for a couple weeks but then got out of that game. They did a good job covering all of the controversy in his life and I have to say I was pleased with how they saw both sides of the story. I really wish I could have been old enough to watch this stuff growing up because some of his interviews are priceless. I always will respect that Tupac said what he had to say no matter how controversial it was. He did not try to build himself up as someone he wasn't if he had something to say he was going to say it. I liked how they covered all of his fans from around the world. It showed the impact that he had on our world as a whole. No matter if you where black, white, Asian, Mexican it didn't matter he had fans from all over. Overall I am going to give this movie a 5/5 rating and if you get a chance you have to buy it. I believe I got it for $6.00 or $7.00.

812903,AYPCUQS6ARWFH,B0001US5T2,"Andre M. ""brnn64""","[5, 6]","I saw Tupac Shakur perform early in his career with the Digital Underground in 1990. I respected some of his work and his apparently sincere concern for the segment of poor Black America that was either ignored, shunned, or exploited.In spite of that, I do not consider myself a fan, despised much of his later antics, and am not in favor of holding him up as an icon. In spite of all that, I loved this DVD.This DVD makes no attempt to either glorify him or demonize him. It shows you as he was-period. You see his heartfelt concerns about the ghettoes of America, his family, and of poor and disfranchised people in general, as well as his more intelligent statements and lyrics. On the other hand, you see the foolishness and self-destructive behavior, especially the unecessary, deadly feud with Biggie Smalls (which, to Biggie's credit, he tried not ot respond in kind), foolishly linking up with criminals like Suge Knight (it should be noted that Tupac never had an arrest record until after he appeared on phonograph records), etc.Some really intriguing moments include a couple of speeches in front of civil rights groups. He is filled with wild profanity (""They say they want me to watch my language-F___ THAT!""), but he really makes some good points about how the civil rights establishment then (and now) does not relate to the poor black youth of the present and has nothing but scorn for them. At first, you respond with a ""this is so embrarrassing"" squirm, but as you really listen to him past the wild cursing, you see that he is being heartfelt and honest about what he is saying (""Don't get mad at us! The only mfers who taught us anything were the pimps and the dope dealers!"").In essence, you get both sides of the shakur story. Revolutionary? Truth teller? or Glorified jackass?

812905,A3OMULJI0PSEF9,B0001US5T2,Brad Lee,"[1, 1]","After watching ""Tupac Resurrection,"" I found myself with a much greater appreciation for 2Pac's music.  I was also amazed how 2Pac's many interviews and recordings were seemlessly pieced together to make it sound as if Tupac himself was narrating his own documentary.  Although it is a bit eerie at first listening to a dead man narrate his own life (and death), it is a much more involving and incredible experience with 2Pac's narration.Tupac lived an amazing life, even if it was tragically cut short.  Tupac Resurrection, then, is a movie that can be appreciated even by people who are not fans of Tupac or rap in general.  I watched this movie with my brother, who is absolutely not a fan of rap at all, and even he enjoyed the movie.  It is just that 2Pac was such a charismatic, intelligent, and poetic man that he is just fascinating to listen to.  And, this movie is doubly fascinating listening to a man narrate his entire life, from birth to death.If you are a fan of 2Pac, this is a must-have.  As I said before, after watching ""Tupac Resurrection"" I gained an even greater appreiciation of his music.  Even for those that aren't fans of Tupac or even rap in general, I highly recommend this movie because it is simply an intense story about a man that is birthed into this world with nothing, becomes rich from an intense dedication to his artistic medium, and then dies a tragic, early death.The only thing I have left to do is quote Roger Ebert's review, because I really believe he hits the nail right on the head when he says, ""Let's assume you are a person who never intends to see a doc about rap music, but might have it in you to see one. This is the one.""  I highly recommend this movie to everyone.  Rap fans or not.

Now, you may seem a bit confused to as why, nearly 10 years after the rap legend's death, that they would just be releasing a film on it. It is a tribute to Tupac, a martyr and legend to the rap community. Tupac Ressurection features real footage of Tupac in his younger days all the way up until his brutal shooting, and I am very excited for the whole thing to come out in theaters. This seems like the thing that should be on Biography, not in the movie theater, but whatever the case is, I am finally glad that someone is recognizing this great person for everyting that he has done. For any 50 Cent, Eminem, or Snoop Dogg fans out there, Tupac is the man that gave them inspiration. He practically invented the gangsta rap genre along with the legendary producer Dr. Dre, producer of such albums as The Marshall Mathers LP and Get Rich or Die Tryin'. Not many people in the world have an appreciation for this man, but people like me do, and I hope the rest of the world will open their eyes to Tupac's story. Go see this film!

However, after viewing this documentary on Tupac, I became very interested in this gifted, talented young man whose life was cut much too short.  The world has lost a truly promising and magnetic artist/activist.  I was genuinely surprised to see that Tupac was a very intelligent and articulate young man.  His writing, his poetry, his acting ability and his political savvy, all were far beyond his young age.  If he had lived and matured, he could (and would, I believe)) have become one of America's leaders.  It is so sad that he is gone.

812908,A5DIAZ5GT3MC,B0001US5T2,Crazy Jim,"[95, 97]","While I am a very big fan of Tupac Shakur, I will present this review based on the movie itself and not ""what an AWESOME rapper"" I think he is or print my own half-baked theories on how he is really alive. I have noticed that pretty much every review has offered very little detail on the film. With the countless amount of DVD's and other product floating around, is there really a need for another movie based on the life of Tupac Shakur? Well, this movie does offer something that none of the others have before and that is narration by Shakur himself.Courtesy of old audio interviews and soundbytes, Tupac tells the story of his life in a way that few others could. From his birth as the son of a Black Panther to his final days in Vegas, Pac goes into detail on it all. Though commentary on his fatal shooting is clearly actually that of his first shooting at a New York recording studio, there are still some very eerie moments here. He talks about his days on Death Row Records in the past tense even though he was there until the day he died, he predicts his own downfall many times, and speaks candidly on a number of subjects that will really surprise you. The inclusion of Shakur's music is another thing that helps seperate this from a lot of the other documentaries on his life. To be able to hear the man himself speak on some of his best and most controversial recordings while they play in the background makes a huge difference.""Resurrection"" really plays like a companion piece to one of Pac's albums. It provides all of the visuals to go with the stories that Pac tells in his complex rhymes. It isn't just a story about rap music though. We're not spending exhausting moments of time in the studio or on concert. This isn't about Tupac the rapper. This movie much like the artist it depicts is bigger than just its contributions to the world of rap music. The film spends most of its time examining the man himself. Going into depth about the controversy surrounding him. It gives him the microphone and allows him to fire back at the hypocritical politicians and Black leaders who try to dismiss his music as ""gangsta rap"" without even attempting to listen to the message behind it. It allows him to speak in great detail about the real horrors of the ghetto. He talks about his experience in prison and how it nearly destroyed him inside. He give us his side of the story on his sexual assault conviction, his NY studio shooting, and the beef with Notorious B.I.G. and Puffy.At times, ""Resurrection"" makes the mistake of pointing us away from things that don't show Shakur in the best of light. Well, it isn't exactly a ""fluff piece"" but there were some details that seem conviently absent. There is a moment where Pac talks proudly about being happy to work with Dr. Dre on Death Row but the movie never makes any mention of their falling out after Dre's departure from Death Row. Pac's feud with Biggie is the only one that actually gets covered while there were several others that at least deserved an honorable mention.For those Pac fans who are still pondering whether this film is worth the price of admission given that you probably have seen or heard every interview and own every DVD, it is. Granted there were a handful of times where I recognized the source of the audio in his narration, it didn't ruin the film at all for me. Seeing this one movie makes all of those other Pac documentaries seem like a waste of money. Pac's story finally gets the respect and attention that it deserves.""Resurrection"" is a very unique film that really educates the average fan on the history of its subject. This film would honestly be best suited for those who no little to nothing on Shakur but continue to dismiss him as some ""loud-mouthed thug"". Sadly, it is that very ignorance that will keep them from ever even giving the movie a chance. With this film, I think Afeni Shakur has done something that I feel she was never able to accomplish in releasing all those posthomous recordings and that is to paint a portrait of Pac that really fits him well. I don't like taking quotes from other reviews, I think Roger Ebert summed it up pretty well when he said ""Even if you don't intend to ever see a rap documentary but might have in it you to see one. This is it."" This film might not convert you into a Tupac Shakur loyalist but if nothing else, it will give you a better understanding of who he was and why so many young people of all races view him as such an important figure.",4,Review of TUPAC RESURRECTION,1069200000,"11 19, 2003",2003,4503,"['am', 'very', 'big', 'fan', 'Tupac', 'Shakur', 'will', 'present', 'review', 'based', 'movie', 'not', 'what', 'AWESOME', 'rapper', 'think', 'print', 'own', 'half-baked', 'theories', 'how', 'really', 'alive', 'have', 'noticed', 'pretty', 'much', 'review', 'offered', 'very', 'little', 'detail', 'film', 'countless', 'amount', 'DVD', 'other', 'product', 'floating', 'around', 'there', 'really', 'need', 'movie', 'based', 'life', 'Tupac', 'Shakur', 'Well', 'movie', 'offer', 'something', 'none', 'others', 'have', 'before', 'narration', 'Shakur', 'himself.Courtesy', 'old', 'audio', 'interviews', 'soundbytes', 'Tupac', 'story', 'life', 'way', 'few', 'others', 'could', 'birth', 'son', 'Black', 'Panther', 'final', 'days', 'Vegas', 'Pac', 'detail', 'Though', 'commentary', 'fatal', 'shooting', 'clearly', 'actually', 'first', 'shooting', 'New', 'York', 'recording', 'studio', 'are', 'still', 'very', 'eerie', 'moments', 'here', 'days', 'Death', 'Row', 'Records', 'past', 'tense', 'even', 'was', 'there', 'day', 'died', 'own', 'downfall', 'many', 'times', 'candidly', 'number', 'subjects', 'will', 'really', 'surprise', 'inclusion', 'Shakur', 'music', 'thing', 'seperate', 'lot', 'other', 'documentaries', 'life', 'be', 'able', 'hear', 'man', 'speak', 'best', 'most', 'controversial', 'recordings', 'play', 'background', 'huge', 'difference', 'Resurrection', 'really', 'companion', 'piece', 'one', 'Pac', 'albums', 'visuals', 'go', 'stories', 'Pac', 'complex', 'rhymes', ""n't"", 'just', 'story', 'rap', 'music', ""'re"", 'not', 'spending', 'exhausting', 'moments', 'time', 'studio', 'concert', ""n't"", 'about', 'Tupac', 'rapper', 'movie', 'much', 'artist', 'bigger', 'just', 'contributions', 'world', 'rap', 'music', 'film', 'most', 'time', 'examining', 'man', 'Going', 'depth', 'controversy', 'surrounding', 'microphone', 'fire', 'back', 'hypocritical', 'politicians', 'Black', 'leaders', 'who', 'try', 'dismiss', 'music', 'gangsta', 'rap', 'even', 'attempting', 'listen', 'message', 'speak', 'great', 'detail', 'real', 'horrors', 'ghetto', 'experience', 'prison', 'how', 'nearly', 'destroyed', 'inside', 'give', 'side', 'story', 'sexual', 'assault', 'conviction', 'NY', 'studio', 'shooting', 'beef', 'Notorious', 'B.I.G', 'Puffy.At', 'times', 'Resurrection', 'mistake', 'pointing', 'away', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'show', 'Shakur', 'best', 'light', 'Well', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'fluff', 'piece', 'were', 'details', 'seem', 'conviently', 'absent', 'moment', 'where', 'Pac', 'talks', 'proudly', 'being', 'happy', 'work', 'Dr.', 'Dre', 'Death', 'Row', 'movie', 'never', 'mention', 'falling', 'out', 'Dre', 'departure', 'Death', 'Row', 'Pac', 'feud', 'Biggie', 'only', 'one', 'actually', 'covered', 'were', 'several', 'others', 'least', 'deserved', 'honorable', 'mention.For', 'Pac', 'fans', 'who', 'are', 'still', 'pondering', 'film', 'price', 'admission', 'given', 'probably', 'have', 'seen', 'heard', 'interview', 'own', 'DVD', 'Granted', 'were', 'handful', 'times', 'where', 'recognized', 'source', 'audio', 'narration', 'did', ""n't"", 'ruin', 'film', 'Seeing', 'one', 'movie', 'other', 'Pac', 'documentaries', 'seem', 'waste', 'money', 'Pac', 'story', 'finally', 'respect', 'attention', 'Resurrection', 'very', 'unique', 'film', 'really', 'average', 'fan', 'history', 'subject', 'film', 'would', 'honestly', 'be', 'best', 'suited', 'who', 'little', 'nothing', 'Shakur', 'continue', 'dismiss', 'loud-mouthed', 'thug', 'Sadly', 'very', 'ignorance', 'will', 'keep', 'ever', 'even', 'giving', 'movie', 'chance', 'film', 'think', 'Afeni', 'Shakur', 'done', 'something', 'feel', 'was', 'never', 'able', 'accomplish', 'releasing', 'posthomous', 'recordings', 'paint', 'portrait', 'Pac', 'really', 'well', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'taking', 'quotes', 'other', 'reviews', 'think', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'summed', 'up', 'pretty', 'well', 'when', 'said', 'Even', 'do', ""n't"", 'intend', 'ever', 'see', 'rap', 'documentary', 'might', 'have', 'see', 'one', 'film', 'might', 'not', 'convert', 'Tupac', 'Shakur', 'loyalist', 'nothing', 'else', 'will', 'give', 'better', 'understanding', 'who', 'was', 'why', 'so', 'many', 'young', 'people', 'races', 'view', 'important', 'figure']",Tupac - Resurrection

It's always tragic when an artist with so much talent dies far too soon, and as intended Tupac's senseless murder casts a shadow over the entirety of Resurrection.

Clendenin,"[2, 3]","In this documentary Tupac Shakur--gangsta rapper, movie star, rape convict, and murder victim--narrates the story of his own life and work. And what a work, with 36 million albums sold (most of them since his death in 1996 at the age of 25), and 150 songs still unrecorded. As I watched this film I moved through successive waves of fascination, even admiration, empathy, and then anger and revulsion. Born to a crack-addicted mom who was in prison when she was pregnant with Tupac, with no father around, Tupac insisted that he spoke for the many hopeless people he grew up with who were trapped in chronic unemployment, police brutality, hunger, poverty and racism. Just as the news media shocked viewers into the horrors of Vietnam with their gruesome images, so, Tupac insisted, he was only chronicling the ghetto ""war zone"" most Americans would otherwise never see: ""All my songs deal with the pain I experienced in childhood."" But you know you have big problems when your own community censures you, including the likes of Jesse Jackson, Al Sharpton and Dionne Warwick. With his trash-talking vulgarity, misogynist lyrics, and rage, Tupac made himself an easy target. In his better moments he admitted he was ""young and dumb."" In the end, you can only lament the self-destructive life and tragic death of an immensely talented artist.",4,"immense talent, wasted life",1169596800,"01 24, 2007",2007,1340,"['documentary', 'Tupac', 'Shakur', 'gangsta', 'rapper', 'movie', 'star', 'rape', 'convict', 'murder', 'victim', 'story', 'own', 'life', 'work', 'what', 'work', '36', 'million', 'albums', 'sold', 'most', 'death', '1996', 'age', '25', '150', 'songs', 'still', 'unrecorded', 'watched', 'film', 'moved', 'through', 'successive', 'waves', 'fascination', 'even', 'admiration', 'empathy', 'then', 'anger', 'revulsion', 'Born', 'crack-addicted', 'mom', 'who', 'was', 'prison', 'when', 'was', 'pregnant', 'Tupac', 'father', 'around', 'Tupac', 'insisted', 'spoke', 'many', 'hopeless', 'people', 'grew', 'up', 'who', 'were', 'trapped', 'chronic', 'unemployment', 'police', 'brutality', 'hunger', 'poverty', 'racism', 'Just', 'news', 'media', 'shocked', 'viewers', 'horrors', 'Vietnam', 'gruesome', 'images', 'so', 'Tupac', 'insisted', 'was', 'only', 'chronicling', 'ghetto', 'war', 'zone', 'most', 'Americans', 'would', 'otherwise', 'never', 'see', 'songs', 'deal', 'pain', 'experienced', 'childhood', 'know', 'have', 'big', 'problems', 'when', 'own', 'community', 'censures', 'including', 'likes', 'Jesse', 'Jackson', 'Al', 'Sharpton', 'Dionne', 'Warwick', 'trash-talking', 'vulgarity', 'misogynist', 'lyrics', 'rage', 'Tupac', 'made', 'easy', 'target', 'better', 'moments', 'admitted', 'was', 'young', 'dumb', 'end', 'can', 'only', 'lament', 'self-destructive', 'life', 'tragic', 'death', 'immensely', 'talented', 'artist']",Tupac - Resurrection
812911,A3GKOMCQTTWPUI,B0001US5T2,"David Foskin ""SneakyGoblin on XBL""","[1, 1]","This mesmerizing documentary about the late rap star Tupac Shakur makes clear what a talented performer and vibrant presence he was, even for audiences who don't listen to rap music and aren't quite sure which rap star/convicted felon/murder victim he was.But it does more than that. It tells a deeply moving story of a gifted, thoughtful, and intelligent young man who has to cope with the challenges of poverty and then has to manage the even more complex challenges of success. And it deals forthrightly with the problems of race and class in America, from racism and police brutality to black on black crime, absent fathers, and the uneasy relationship between showbiz ""thug life"" and the real thing. At one point, he says, ""I really did believe that no black person would ever shoot me.""The movie was produced by Shakur's mother and MTV, which provided access to broadcast footage, interviews, and outakes. That allows Shakur, eerily, to tell the story himself, even predicting his own violent death. He warns us that this will be a story of ""violence, redemption, and love,"" and that proves to be true.Shakur's mother was one of the few women leaders of the Black Panthers. She went to prison when she was pregnant with him. He was deeply aware that he served time in prison before he was born. He also respected his mother's activism but felt that he did not get enough of her attention. ""I always felt she cared more about 'the people' than her people."" He missed having a strong male role model. ""You need a man to teach you to be a man.""He cared for his community but hated being poor. He briefly dealt drugs, but even the local dealers urged him to follow his dream. He loved performing and was accepted at a school for the arts. By the time he was a teenager, he was working professionally. By the time he was 20, he was a successful recording artist.He understood the irony when it was only after he became famous that he was picked up by the cops. A citation for jaywalking led to a confrontation that became a beating.Meanwhile, he is stunned and humbled to find that his visibility has young people looking to him for leadership. He takes it seriously, and gives a lot of thought to what he wants to tell them. He helps develop a code of behavior for ""thugs"" that covers things like keeping civilians out of the line of fire in gang warfare and taking responsibility for children.Shakur is clearly and refreshingly as free from any form of prejudice as it is possible to be, at least in his own relationships. He uses racist and sexist language in the songs he writes, but also writes about respecting women. He has enormous charm but is also a thoughtful young man who wants to understand the world better and he wants to make an important contribution. He admits his mistakes freely and he learns from them and moves on. Anyone who watches this movie will feel his loss and want to carry forward his dreams.Parents should know that this movie includes a great deal of very bad language, including racist terms (with some discussion of when they are and are not racist). Characters use drugs, drink, and smoke, and the ravages of drug addiction are frankly described. Characters engage in violent behavior and sexual abuse, including assault and shooting, and some go to jail. Shakur and other characters are shot and murdered. There are candid discussions of police brutality and racism. All of these issues and the consequences are presented in a realistic way that parents may find more suitable for teenagers than the usual shoot-out and explosion movie.",5,The best account around!,1132444800,"11 20, 2005",2005,3575,"['mesmerizing', 'documentary', 'late', 'rap', 'star', 'Tupac', 'Shakur', 'clear', 'what', 'talented', 'performer', 'vibrant', 'presence', 'was', 'even', 'audiences', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'listen', 'rap', 'music', 'are', ""n't"", 'quite', 'sure', 'rap', 'star/convicted', 'felon/murder', 'victim', 'was.But', 'more', 'deeply', 'moving', 'story', 'gifted', 'thoughtful', 'intelligent', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'cope', 'challenges', 'poverty', 'then', 'manage', 'even', 'more', 'complex', 'challenges', 'success', 'forthrightly', 'problems', 'race', 'class', 'America', 'racism', 'police', 'brutality', 'black', 'black', 'crime', 'absent', 'fathers', 'uneasy', 'relationship', 'showbiz', 'thug', 'life', 'real', 'thing', 'one', 'point', 'really', 'did', 'believe', 'black', 'person', 'would', 'ever', 'shoot', 'movie', 'was', 'produced', 'Shakur', 'mother', 'MTV', 'provided', 'access', 'broadcast', 'footage', 'interviews', 'outakes', 'Shakur', 'eerily', 'tell', 'story', 'even', 'predicting', 'own', 'violent', 'death', 'will', 'be', 'story', 'violence', 'redemption', 'love', 'be', 'mother', 'was', 'one', 'few', 'women', 'leaders', 'Black', 'Panthers', 'went', 'prison', 'when', 'was', 'pregnant', 'was', 'deeply', 'aware', 'served', 'time', 'prison', 'was', 'born', 'also', 'respected', 'mother', 'activism', 'felt', 'did', 'not', 'get', 'enough', 'attention', 'always', 'felt', 'cared', 'more', ""'the"", 'people', 'people', 'missed', 'having', 'strong', 'male', 'role', 'model', 'need', 'man', 'teach', 'be', 'man', 'cared', 'community', 'hated', 'being', 'poor', 'dealt', 'drugs', 'even', 'local', 'dealers', 'urged', 'follow', 'dream', 'loved', 'performing', 'was', 'accepted', 'school', 'arts', 'time', 'was', 'teenager', 'was', 'working', 'professionally', 'time', 'was', '20', 'was', 'successful', 'recording', 'artist.He', 'understood', 'irony', 'when', 'was', 'only', 'became', 'famous', 'was', 'picked', 'up', 'cops', 'citation', 'jaywalking', 'led', 'confrontation', 'became', 'beating.Meanwhile', 'stunned', 'humbled', 'find', 'visibility', 'young', 'people', 'looking', 'leadership', 'seriously', 'lot', 'thought', 'what', 'tell', 'develop', 'code', 'behavior', 'thugs', 'things', 'keeping', 'civilians', 'line', 'fire', 'gang', 'warfare', 'taking', 'responsibility', 'children.Shakur', 'clearly', 'refreshingly', 'free', 'form', 'prejudice', 'possible', 'be', 'least', 'own', 'relationships', 'racist', 'sexist', 'language', 'songs', 'also', 'respecting', 'women', 'enormous', 'charm', 'also', 'thoughtful', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'understand', 'world', 'better', 'make', 'important', 'contribution', 'mistakes', 'freely', 'moves', 'Anyone', 'who', 'movie', 'will', 'feel', 'loss', 'want', 'carry', 'forward', 'dreams.Parents', 'should', 'know', 'movie', 'great', 'deal', 'very', 'bad', 'language', 'including', 'racist', 'terms', 'discussion', 'when', 'are', 'are', 'not', 'racist', 'Characters', 'use', 'drugs', 'drink', 'smoke', 'ravages', 'drug', 'addiction', 'are', 'frankly', 'described', 'Characters', 'engage', 'violent', 'behavior', 'sexual', 'abuse', 'including', 'assault', 'shooting', 'go', 'jail', 'Shakur', 'other', 'characters', 'are', 'shot', 'murdered', 'are', 'candid', 'discussions', 'police', 'brutality', 'racism', 'issues', 'consequences', 'are', 'presented', 'realistic', 'way', 'parents', 'may', 'find', 'more', 'suitable', 'teenagers', 'usual', 'shoot-out', 'explosion', 'movie']",Tupac - Resurrection

If all you know of Tupac Shakur is his time at Death Row Records, his sexual abuse case and his death under the specator of the East Coast/West Coast thing, then you need to peep this.A lot of people don't know that was actually a trained actor from a very prestigious arts school in Baltimore, MD and not just some thug who got a part in a film because he was a rapper. Don't believe me? Then watch the film as he's shown with classmates such as Jada Pinkett-Smith (that's right, Will Smith's wife) and other stars that are big now. They also show him with established stars such as Jasmine Guy (Whitley Gilbert from A Different World), Mickie Rourke and even Madonna in her younger days.Admittedly, I wasn't a huge 2PAC fan as I felt he was a bit overrated as a rapper (though he was FAR better than the crowd that we got now, especially Kanye West)! He was, however, an intelligent and (when he wanted to be) very articulate man. Not a bad actor either. That makes this even more tragic.Just my opinion but he, in part, brought about his own death. While I have no doubt he was set up, a lot of choices he made towards the end of his life contributed to his early demise in my view.Anyway, its probably the most comprehensive look at this guy that you will ever see in my opinion.

He seemed to be a talented creative man with the ability to throw rhymes and put him emotions into making art. Negative thoughts or images can also be made into art and I think some of that was accomplished by him. Not to say that his thoughts were all negative. He made some valid points. I liked how he said that were are all America and he wanted acceptance for himself not just about the race, but about what he believed surrounded his people, poverty, unfair and unequal treatment, drug addicts, gangsters, etc. I believe that too, I believe that we all need to be accepted because we all make up this country, no matter if what we do is positive or negative or both. Some of the stuff he said seemed hypocritical. So I took some stuff and threw some stuff away. What stood out was this enigmatic character, who had a whole lot of energy. He wanted alot of attention and maybe some of the need for attention may have turned into addiction. I think this strivng to be heard and respected could have caused problems for him. Whether he ticked the wrong people off or was murdered as a marketing strategy, your guess is as good as mine. It seems like whenever a black man gets to vocal he seems to get taken out. I could be wrong it just seems like that. Who does it or who is behind it may be different in each case or it may not be. It is just sad. I think as Tupac evolved he could have really been a force in the black community as a whole, not just for the ghetto but even more than that. The movie basically tells the story of Tupac, which has been pieced together brilliantly, in his own words. That is what really hits home. It really seems like he is talking from the other side.

We get to know about his childhood, his relationship with his mother (a Black panther, and one of the producers of this documentary), and his beginnings as an artist. We are also allowed to hear his point of view about many issues, the kind of things he did to help his community, and the mistakes he made. Most importantly, we can hear his songs, the controversial music in which he expressed what he felt and who he was.On the whole, I think that this documentary is outstanding. Notwithstanding the fact that it is subjective, it manages to entertain and inform at the same time. And even though you must not expect to know the whole truth about Tupac after watching ""Tupac: resurrection"", I'm confident you will have a pretty good idea of why we is remembered by so many even now.

812923,AT393OR1JTYNR,B0001US5T2,Miami Nights,"[2, 5]","""Tupac -- Resurrection"" takes a page from the ""Peter Tosh -- Stepping Razor/Red X"" documentary ""book"" by basically having Tupac Shakur tell his own story by weaving together snippets of interviews with the rapper himself.The documentary of reggae legend Tosh did it to better effect, namely because the ""Red X"" tapes were made by Tosh with the intent to turn them into his own story, spoken in his own voice. And both interesting and sad, Tupac's life and death somewhat mirrors the life of the Jamaican legend who still is put in the shadows of Bob Marley's iconic worship. Tosh also lived by the gun and died by the gun. His gun was his fiery vocals and lyrics, and it was his relentless, don't-back-down stances that made him a target of the government and police who would mark all his government papers with a red ""X."" And he was beaten by the police on numerous occassions, one time almost being beaten to death. And it was his unflinching demand for equal rights that lead to his death at his home in 1987.And so, in many ways Tupac is like an American Tosh. He was similarly relentless, and uttered truths in an in-your-face, unabridged manner.Whereas Tosh's documentary is governed by a sadness stemming from a childhood in which he was abandoned by his father (and had no fatherly presence in his life) and was taunted and teased for being ""dark-skinned"" -- ultimately all he wanted was love, not just for himself, but for the poor and struggling, and he was seeking the always-elusive truth to bring it to the people (both friend and foe alike), a lonely man always seeking happiness and love, but yet he never truly found it.In contrast, while Tupac fought for much of the same and had a semi-similar upbringing (lacking a father), he had more support around him (going to the Baltimore arts school), and he was a living, walking contradiction as many who fall under the Gemini sign are, living in many extremes (feminist--misogynist, lover--firebrand, sensitive--hateful). For Tosh, he didn't fly between such opposites -- he was who he was, didn't pander to anyone or anything, but what he believed to be the truth.So while Tosh's documentary is driven by an underlying sadness of unrequited love, Tupac's movie carries with it a sort of ghostly creepiness, as it begins with him seemingly speaking about his own murder. It may be somewhat light and superficial as many documentaries for fallen icons are, but it doesn't entirely shy away from showing his faults. It may not answer new questions, but it's still worth picking up for any Tupac fan, if only because you have Tupac, like Tosh, telling his own story -- which is arguably the best way to hear his story.Who knew it?

812924,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B0001US5T2,mirasreviews,"[21, 21]","""Tupac Resurrection"" is a documentary celebrating the life of Grammy-nominated rapper Tupac Shakur. Tupac's mother, Afeni Shakur, serves as executive producer on the film, so this is really a loving tribute to her son, made for his many fans. Because MTV produced ""Tupac Resurrection"", director Lauren Lazin was able to include material from MTV's archives, which would otherwise not be available. Lauren Lazin has done a good job of presenting a coherent portrait of Tupac Shakur's music, message, and personality, from his childhood in Harlem to his death in Las Vegas in 1996, at the age of 25. ""Tupac Resurrection"" isn't going to convert anyone who doesn't already like Tupac Shakur's music or share his political convictions. His detractors will find their justification in the film, and his fans will find theirs. Perhaps ironically, that is the film's  strength. ""Tupac Resurrection"" uses a lot of interview audio, as well as the interviews, themselves, to present Tupac's life in his own words. He speaks for himself here. Afeni Shakur and director Lauren Lazin are to be commended for including the less admirable aspects of Tupac's personality, including coverage of his 1994 trial for sexual abuse which resulted in Shakur serving eleven months in prison. Tupac Shakur once said that his life is a story of ""ambition, violence, redemption, and love"". Love him or hate him, this is a very good documentary about a man who not only cultivated the image of constant conflict, but also the reality.The DVD: This is a very good package of bonus features for Tupac Shakur fans. In ""Interviews"", you will find a never-before-seen interview from 1992, recorded by MTV while Shakur was recording ""A Very Special Christmas, Vol. 2"" and an interview with Tupac and Snoop Dogg that was taped after the 1996 Music Video Awards. The ""Malcolm X Dinner Speech"" is a speech Tupac gave in 1992 at a dinner banquet given by the Malcolm X Grassroots Movement. ""Deposition"" is a video taped deposition that Tupac gave in 1995 while in the Clinton Correctional Facility concerning a lawsuit. ""About the Resurrection Soundtrack"" features three songs from the movie accompanied by interviews with the artists: 2 songs by Eminem and one by 50 Cent. There are two videos in ""Music Videos"". In ""Remembering Tupac"" ten actors and musicians and nine family members talk about what Tupac Shakur meant to them in mostly separate interviews. The celebrities include Jada Pinkett Smith, Snoop Dogg, Treach, Mary Jo Blige, and 50 Cent. ""Mutulu Shakur Interview"" is with Tupac's stepfather. In ""Tupac Amaru Shakur Center for the Arts"", Afeni Shakur talks about the performing arts center that bears her son's name. ""Bootleg This!"" is a short statement concerning lawsuits against Tupac Shakur's estate. Also included are some deleted scenes and an audio commentary featuring director Lauren Lazin, Tupac's mother and executive producer Afeni Shakur, and some surprise guests. I wouldn't recommend the bonus features if you're simply interested in learning about Tupac Shakur, but are not especially a fan. It really doesn't provide any additional insight.

812926,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B0001US5T2,Roland E. Zwick,"[6, 9]","***1/2 Gangsta' Rap artist Tupac Shakur was gunned down on the streets of Las Vegas in 1996, the end result of the life he led and the people he knew.  He was 25.  The documentary ""Tupac: Resurrection"" takes an unusual and interesting approach to its subject, allowing the deceased singer to speak to us, as it were, directly from the grave.  The film begins with him commenting on his own murder, then tracing back over the events of his life as a means of both setting the record straight and trying to make some sense out of all that happened to him in his very brief time here on earth.The film, directed by Lauren Lazin, relies primarily on interviews Tupac gave throughout his short career, supplemented with some additional commentary from those who knew him best.  Though he became a lightning rod of controversy due to both his criminal activities and his provocative (i.e. violent, sexist) lyrics, Tupac saw himself more as a ""voice of the people,"" using his music as a vehicle for reaching out to and connecting with the downtrodden, impoverished blacks living in the kinds of ghettoes from which he himself sprang.  However, even many well-known black leaders and spokespersons had trouble accepting Tupac's rather rose-colored definition of himself.  What's most interesting about ""Tupac: Resurrection"" is the dichotomy it establishes between the violence, drug use and criminal activities which played so prominent a part in Tupac's life, and the genial, reflective, almost apologetic tone of so much of what we hear him saying.  It's hard to know just how much of what has found its way into this film is really raw truth and how much is sugarcoated revisionism designed to ""resurrect"" and burnish a man's posthumous image and reputation.  His views on women come out particularly incoherent and unresolved.  Yet, ""Tupac: Resurrection"" is an intriguing documentary because it gives us a glimpse not only into a strangely conflicted individual but also into the even more bizarre world of corporate thuggery he inhabited.  Like many artists who have attempted to speak for the ""little people,"" Tupac became a victim of his own success and celebrity, living the kind of pampered lifestyle that most of the people he was singing about would clearly never know.  It's a conflict as old as art itself, and it is one that Tupac, for understandable reasons, was never able to resolve in his own life.  Interestingly, however, his brutal death at the hands of murderous rivals, demonstrated that he never made it quite so far from his roots as his lavish lifestyle might otherwise have suggested.As a document, the film traces Tupac from his early years as the child of two Black Panther members ( a pedigree that, he believes, set him on the path to social crusader early on), through his youth in poverty, his exposure to literature and drama at a performing arts high school in Baltimore, his early attempts at performing, his meteoric rise in the music industry, his years as a controversial celebrity, his burgeoning film career, his continuing battles with police, the first attempt on his life, his conviction for rape, his time in prison, and, finally, to the rivalry between his own West Coast label, Death Row Records, and the East Coast label, Bad Boy Records, which ultimately led to his untimely death.  For that little bit of history alone, the film is worth watching.As someone who knew very little about the life of Tupac - and even less about his music - before watching the movie, I found him to be both appealing and repellant, frightening and charismatic.  The film leaves the audience feeling as conflicted as the subject - which is what a truly successful documentary should do after all.",3,compelling view of a man's life,1095465600,"09 18, 2004",2004,3717,"['***1/2', 'Gangsta', 'Rap', 'artist', 'Tupac', 'Shakur', 'was', 'gunned', 'down', 'streets', 'Las', 'Vegas', '1996', 'end', 'result', 'life', 'led', 'people', 'knew', 'was', '25', 'documentary', 'Tupac', 'Resurrection', 'unusual', 'interesting', 'approach', 'subject', 'allowing', 'deceased', 'singer', 'speak', 'were', 'directly', 'grave', 'film', 'commenting', 'own', 'murder', 'then', 'tracing', 'back', 'events', 'life', 'means', 'setting', 'record', 'straight', 'trying', 'make', 'sense', 'happened', 'very', 'brief', 'time', 'here', 'earth.The', 'film', 'directed', 'Lauren', 'Lazin', 'primarily', 'interviews', 'Tupac', 'gave', 'short', 'career', 'supplemented', 'additional', 'commentary', 'who', 'knew', 'best', 'became', 'lightning', 'rod', 'controversy', 'due', 'criminal', 'activities', 'provocative', 'i.e', 'violent', 'sexist', 'lyrics', 'Tupac', 'saw', 'more', 'voice', 'people', 'using', 'music', 'vehicle', 'reaching', 'out', 'connecting', 'downtrodden', 'impoverished', 'blacks', 'living', 'kinds', 'ghettoes', 'sprang', 'However', 'even', 'many', 'well-known', 'black', 'leaders', 'spokespersons', 'had', 'trouble', 'accepting', 'Tupac', 'rather', 'rose-colored', 'definition', 'What', 'most', 'interesting', 'Tupac', 'Resurrection', 'dichotomy', 'violence', 'drug', 'use', 'criminal', 'activities', 'played', 'so', 'prominent', 'part', 'Tupac', 'life', 'genial', 'reflective', 'almost', 'apologetic', 'tone', 'so', 'much', 'what', 'hear', 'saying', 'hard', 'know', 'just', 'how', 'much', 'what', 'found', 'way', 'film', 'really', 'raw', 'truth', 'how', 'much', 'sugarcoated', 'revisionism', 'designed', 'resurrect', 'burnish', 'man', 'posthumous', 'image', 'reputation', 'views', 'women', 'come', 'out', 'particularly', 'incoherent', 'unresolved', 'Tupac', 'Resurrection', 'intriguing', 'documentary', 'glimpse', 'not', 'only', 'strangely', 'conflicted', 'individual', 'also', 'even', 'more', 'bizarre', 'world', 'corporate', 'thuggery', 'inhabited', 'many', 'artists', 'who', 'have', 'attempted', 'speak', 'little', 'people', 'Tupac', 'became', 'victim', 'own', 'success', 'celebrity', 'living', 'kind', 'pampered', 'lifestyle', 'most', 'people', 'was', 'singing', 'about', 'would', 'clearly', 'never', 'know', 'conflict', 'as', 'old', 'art', 'one', 'Tupac', 'understandable', 'reasons', 'was', 'never', 'able', 'resolve', 'own', 'life', 'Interestingly', 'however', 'brutal', 'death', 'hands', 'murderous', 'rivals', 'demonstrated', 'never', 'made', 'quite', 'so', 'far', 'roots', 'lavish', 'lifestyle', 'might', 'otherwise', 'have', 'suggested.As', 'document', 'film', 'traces', 'Tupac', 'early', 'years', 'child', 'two', 'Black', 'Panther', 'members', 'pedigree', 'set', 'path', 'social', 'crusader', 'early', 'youth', 'poverty', 'exposure', 'literature', 'drama', 'performing', 'arts', 'high', 'school', 'Baltimore', 'early', 'attempts', 'performing', 'meteoric', 'rise', 'music', 'industry', 'years', 'controversial', 'celebrity', 'burgeoning', 'film', 'career', 'continuing', 'battles', 'police', 'first', 'attempt', 'life', 'conviction', 'rape', 'time', 'prison', 'finally', 'rivalry', 'own', 'West', 'Coast', 'label', 'Death', 'Row', 'Records', 'East', 'Coast', 'label', 'Bad', 'Boy', 'Records', 'ultimately', 'led', 'untimely', 'death', 'little', 'bit', 'history', 'alone', 'film', 'worth', 'watching.As', 'someone', 'who', 'knew', 'very', 'little', 'life', 'Tupac', 'even', 'less', 'music', 'watching', 'movie', 'found', 'be', 'appealing', 'repellant', 'frightening', 'charismatic', 'film', 'audience', 'feeling', 'as', 'conflicted', 'subject', 'what', 'truly', 'successful', 'documentary', 'should', 'do']",Tupac - Resurrection

My dad had a hard life like Tupac. He was a black poor man living with his mom, ten brothers, and two sisters. My grandmother didn't work. She stayed home making baby's with different man in her life. I don't remember when I started listening to Tupac's music. But I like his music and I have a lot of respect for him.I just finished watching Tupac Resurrection. I am very proud to say I own this dvd. I haven't seen any other documentary movies about his life. But I think this movie is great. It tells me a lot about him.I remember when I went to watch Tupac Resurrection at the movie theaters a girl who sat behind me and my friends was goofing around. As soon as the screen showed the words Tupac Resurrection she laughed hard and loud. My friend turned around and told her SHOW SOME RESPECT. Everyone who was there to see Tupac Resurrection clapped.

If you dont know anything about Pac or you dont know much about him this is the dvd you want to learn more about and the type of life that he lead .  He had almost different faces of him some people knew him as a gangster, some knew him as a poet, some thought he was to violen, some thought that he was no good , others saw him as a kind gentle caring man.  Whatever side you choose to belive in him is up to you you will see his many sides in this dvd. Me personally I believe that he had a little bit of everyone of these sides but was more good than evil.  This is a must and would probably be his best dvd to date.Tupac 4 Ever""God Bless The Dead""R.I.P.

812933,A9C375HSNCY9,B0001US5T2,Trevor Cotton,"[3, 3]","If you are looking for a Tupac DVD, this is where you should start, Resurrection is the most comprehensive look at all of Pac's life, from his childhood, until his fatal shooting.  Unlike other documentaries, this looks at his entire life and it is also endorsed by Afeni Shakur, which could be good or bad depending on how you look at it.  It is also entirely narrated by Tupac, splicing together interviews and bits of speech to create the voiceover.  I know some people object to this, however when you watch it the majority of the speech comes from about four or five seperate interviews, which they show large sections of, so he did say most of what is on here.As you would expect with his mother on the project, it gives a fair and balanced account of Pac's life, concentrating perhaps a little more on his caring side rather than his thug persona.  Including interviews with childhood friends like Jada Pinkett, some of the main players at Death Row, and also footage from the infamous incident at the MGM, hours before his death, there is little left unturned.For a quality overview of Pac's life, this is the DVD to get, my only minor complaint is the lack of music video extras, only Brenda's Got A Baby and Trapped are included as extras.  They could have included more, although perhaps Suge Knight had a say on his Death Row material.  Regardless, this is highly reccomended.",5,The Best Tupac DVD,1133827200,"12 6, 2005",2005,1388,"['are', 'looking', 'Tupac', 'DVD', 'where', 'should', 'start', 'Resurrection', 'most', 'comprehensive', 'look', 'Pac', 'life', 'childhood', 'fatal', 'shooting', 'other', 'documentaries', 'entire', 'life', 'also', 'endorsed', 'Afeni', 'Shakur', 'could', 'be', 'good', 'bad', 'depending', 'how', 'look', 'also', 'entirely', 'narrated', 'Tupac', 'splicing', 'together', 'interviews', 'bits', 'speech', 'create', 'voiceover', 'know', 'people', 'object', 'however', 'when', 'watch', 'majority', 'speech', 'four', 'five', 'seperate', 'interviews', 'show', 'large', 'sections', 'did', 'say', 'most', 'what', 'here.As', 'would', 'expect', 'mother', 'project', 'fair', 'balanced', 'account', 'Pac', 'life', 'concentrating', 'perhaps', 'little', 'more', 'caring', 'side', 'rather', 'thug', 'persona', 'Including', 'interviews', 'childhood', 'friends', 'Jada', 'Pinkett', 'main', 'players', 'Death', 'Row', 'also', 'footage', 'infamous', 'incident', 'MGM', 'hours', 'death', 'little', 'left', 'unturned.For', 'quality', 'overview', 'Pac', 'life', 'DVD', 'get', 'only', 'minor', 'complaint', 'lack', 'music', 'video', 'extras', 'only', 'Brenda', 'Got', 'A', 'Baby', 'Trapped', 'are', 'included', 'extras', 'could', 'have', 'included', 'more', 'perhaps', 'Suge', 'Knight', 'had', 'say', 'Death', 'Row', 'material', 'Regardless', 'highly', 'reccomended']",Tupac - Resurrection
