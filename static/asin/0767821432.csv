As  such, when this film first appeard I went to see it and as usual was not  disappointed.It still amazes me that so much attention was lavished on  ""Lone Star"" when every other John Sayles movie is worthy of  mention.Disregard any review which proclaims this to be Thelma and  Louise meets... this is not what the film is about. An intelligent, well  scripted, well-acted film, Passion Fish just happens to focus more on female characters and especially the friendship that develops between two women.

15890,A3R2YB0WTTB0IJ,0767821432,,"[3, 3]","Author-director John Sayles is one of (if not) the most important american flmmakers of the last twenty years. Furiously independent, he works with the same actors over the years and has produced, apart of PASSION FISH,  such magistral movies as LONE STAR and THE SECRET OF ROAN INISH. When he  doesn't direct, he writes or re-writes, credited or uncredited, such  screenplays as APOLLO XIII, THE QUICK AND THE DEAD or THE HOWLING. If  Hollywood doesn't completely fall apart, one has to thank men like John  Sayles. The true spirit of the pioneers of cinema still live in those  independent ones.PASSION FISH is a movie about women. The four or five  male characters of the movie are anecdotal. They are considered as pure  procreators (do you remember the exact number of Sugar and Rennie's  children ?) or intruders like Chantelle's ex-husband or May-Alice's uncle.  And the action takes place in Louisiana, a feminine state by  excellence.May-Alice cannot walk anymore but has a lot to say while  Chantelle keeps the secret of her past in the dancehall's nights. PASSION  FISH explains how these two women will finally appreciate each other's  presence. Their reunion on a small boat is a magistral idea of John Sayles  : May-Alice still can't walk but she moves. She's back in the  world.PASSION FISH is the ideal movie for multiple viewings.

15892,AZ4Q3VAK6CIJS,0767821432,,"[4, 11]","I love John Sayles's movies--and he's an excellent short story writer, too. I hadn't gotten around to watching PASSION FISH, though, until very recently. It's everything I'd come to expect in a Sayles film: compelling dialogue, fascinating characters (all of them, even the bit-players who were only in one or two scenes), great soundtrack, smart casting, and wise, subtle humor.The story is basically about two guarded, emotionally damaged women who find strength in each other as their friendship evolves.However, there were a few little errors that irritated me, particularly since I had it on good authority that Sayles's understanding of rural Louisiana was dead-on.  Apparently Sayles hadn't hired any Chicago fact-checkers, although one major, and a few minor, characters were from Chicago.The sticking points were:1. Two characters are discussing their Chicago origins and mention the high schools they attended. The Angela Bassett character says she graduated from Cooley High. Unfortunately, there's no such place. Maybe Sayles was giving a nod to the iconic movie of the same name, so we'll let him pass on this one.2. The other character, Chantelle, supposedly graduated from DuSable High. At one point there was, indeed, a high school with that name. But she calls it ""Du SAY ble High"", while any Chicagoan would know the pronunciation is ""Du SAH ble."" This is as bad as if Sayles had a Kentuckian refer to LouISSville. Sheesh.3. A passing reference is  made to a ""joke"" about Chicago having been burned, in relation to the race riots of the late 1960's. Sayles has evidently never visited the West Side, which, 40 years later, still hasn't recovered from the initial arson fest and the subsequent abandonment and decay of that part of Chicago. Despite the occasional stab at gentrification, the area remains impoverished and desolate. That's no joke to the people who are still stuck there.I recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a good character-driven tale--and I recommend ""The Encyclopedia of Chicago"" to Sayles's production team, just in case.",3,Sayles Bait,1181001600,"06 5, 2007",2007,2066,"['love', 'John', 'Sayles', 'movies', 'excellent', 'short', 'story', 'writer', 'too', 'had', ""n't"", 'gotten', 'watching', 'PASSION', 'FISH', 'though', 'very', 'recently', 'everything', ""'d"", 'come', 'expect', 'Sayles', 'film', 'compelling', 'dialogue', 'fascinating', 'characters', 'even', 'bit-players', 'who', 'were', 'only', 'one', 'two', 'scenes', 'great', 'soundtrack', 'smart', 'casting', 'wise', 'subtle', 'humor.The', 'story', 'basically', 'about', 'two', 'guarded', 'emotionally', 'damaged', 'women', 'who', 'find', 'strength', 'other', 'friendship', 'evolves.However', 'were', 'few', 'little', 'errors', 'irritated', 'particularly', 'had', 'good', 'authority', 'Sayles', 'understanding', 'rural', 'Louisiana', 'was', 'dead-on', 'Apparently', 'Sayles', 'had', ""n't"", 'hired', 'Chicago', 'fact-checkers', 'one', 'major', 'few', 'minor', 'characters', 'were', 'Chicago.The', 'sticking', 'points', 'were:1', 'Two', 'characters', 'are', 'discussing', 'Chicago', 'origins', 'mention', 'high', 'schools', 'attended', 'Angela', 'Bassett', 'character', 'graduated', 'Cooley', 'High', 'Unfortunately', 'such', 'place', 'Maybe', 'Sayles', 'was', 'giving', 'nod', 'iconic', 'movie', 'same', 'name', ""'ll"", 'let', 'pass', 'one.2', 'other', 'character', 'Chantelle', 'supposedly', 'graduated', 'DuSable', 'High', 'one', 'point', 'was', 'indeed', 'high', 'school', 'name', 'Du', 'SAY', 'ble', 'High', 'Chicagoan', 'would', 'know', 'pronunciation', 'Du', 'SAH', 'ble', 'as', 'bad', 'Sayles', 'had', 'Kentuckian', 'refer', 'LouISSville', 'Sheesh.3', 'A', 'passing', 'reference', 'made', 'joke', 'Chicago', 'having', 'been', 'burned', 'relation', 'race', 'riots', 'late', '1960', 'Sayles', 'evidently', 'never', 'visited', 'West', 'Side', '40', 'years', 'later', 'still', ""n't"", 'recovered', 'initial', 'arson', 'fest', 'subsequent', 'abandonment', 'decay', 'part', 'Chicago', 'occasional', 'stab', 'gentrification', 'area', 'impoverished', 'desolate', 'joke', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'still', 'stuck', 'there.I', 'recommend', 'movie', 'anyone', 'who', 'good', 'character-driven', 'tale', 'recommend', 'Encyclopedia', 'Chicago', 'Sayles', 'production', 'team', 'just', 'case']",N/A

I decided to give it a try the night--very late in the night, I should say--before it was due, and boy was I ever wrong.  This is one of the most moving and evocative movies that I've watched in a while, and could not help but watch it through to the end despite the late hour.  This is one of the few times when I can say that I feel that a movie was perfectly cast.  The acting, the character development is superb, and a nice tight story and excellent script.  I most enjoyed the scene on the Bayou to the song Le Danse de Mardi Gras, it was just so beautifully done and the song really evokes the ""fecund""--as one minor whimsically puts it when trying to decribe Louisiana--of the region.

15901,AP9RVNCXHB3OB,0767821432,Thayer,"[5, 5]","It's nice to see two lead characters in a movie that are flawed and talk, act, and react like normal people. Even though the movie clocks in more than 2 hours, it didn't feel long. As a viewer I looked forward to the next scene not because I was anticipating a big revelation in the plot but because I was so taken by the story I want to know why they act the way they did.The movie opens with Mary Mcdonell, who played a soap opera diva, in a hospital oblivious to the fact that she had a surgery due to a car accident that would make her unable to walk. She was assisted by numerous nurses but all of them quit because of her not so pleasant attitude. Then came Alfre Woodard, a spunky nurse who has a problem of her own. She was the only one who was able to handle Mary Mcdonnel. The relationship between the two women, who were living lives they never imagined to be living, is the heart and soul of the movie.What I like about the movie is that it didn't resort to melodrama in order to tell the story in full punch. The ending did not resort to a quick resolution where both of the ladies' problems go away and the two leads suddenly become the best of friends. They would probably still face the same problems and they would still probably fight occasionally, but now they have a better perspective in looking at things and more important, they now acknowledge how each affect and help each other in the obvious ways and the not so obvious ways. It's a low key but beautiful ending as the movie ended with the two ladies in the boat facing each other in the sunset.Grade: A-",5,A Passionate Movie,1126051200,"09 7, 2005",2005,1581,"['nice', 'see', 'two', 'lead', 'characters', 'movie', 'are', 'flawed', 'talk', 'act', 'react', 'normal', 'people', 'Even', 'movie', 'clocks', 'more', '2', 'hours', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'long', 'viewer', 'looked', 'forward', 'next', 'scene', 'not', 'was', 'anticipating', 'big', 'revelation', 'plot', 'was', 'so', 'taken', 'story', 'want', 'know', 'why', 'act', 'way', 'did.The', 'movie', 'Mary', 'Mcdonell', 'who', 'played', 'soap', 'opera', 'diva', 'hospital', 'oblivious', 'fact', 'had', 'surgery', 'due', 'car', 'accident', 'would', 'make', 'unable', 'walk', 'was', 'assisted', 'numerous', 'nurses', 'quit', 'not', 'so', 'pleasant', 'attitude', 'Then', 'came', 'Alfre', 'Woodard', 'spunky', 'nurse', 'who', 'problem', 'own', 'was', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'was', 'able', 'handle', 'Mary', 'Mcdonnel', 'relationship', 'two', 'women', 'who', 'were', 'living', 'lives', 'never', 'imagined', 'be', 'living', 'heart', 'soul', 'movie.What', 'like', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'resort', 'melodrama', 'order', 'tell', 'story', 'full', 'punch', 'ending', 'did', 'not', 'resort', 'quick', 'resolution', 'where', 'ladies', 'problems', 'go', 'away', 'two', 'suddenly', 'become', 'best', 'friends', 'would', 'probably', 'still', 'face', 'same', 'problems', 'would', 'still', 'probably', 'fight', 'occasionally', 'now', 'have', 'better', 'perspective', 'looking', 'things', 'more', 'important', 'now', 'acknowledge', 'how', 'affect', 'help', 'other', 'obvious', 'ways', 'not', 'so', 'obvious', 'ways', 'low', 'key', 'beautiful', 'ending', 'movie', 'ended', 'two', 'ladies', 'boat', 'facing', 'other', 'sunset.Grade', 'A-']",N/A
