1110080,A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL,B000WLYDNM,"&#34;Rocky Raccoon&#34; ""Hey, Doc, It's Only ...","[67, 70]","Recent Best Foreign Oscar Film nominee `Mongol' is an impressive epic.  Telling the first installment of the life and times of Ghengis Khan, we get more than a history lesson, but a personal account of a fraternal feud for power.  Filmed with breathtaking cinematography and a sound that should have garnered a separate nomination, the movie is a sweeping drama, complete with battles that make similar `300' scenes obvious digitalized formula.Although the film goes ahead (mostly in chronological order) with several ""One Year Later"" and other useful captions, we lose ourselves in a story of one man's struggle for survival among his Khan and the love interests that shape, bind and beget tribal rivalries and aspirations.  We follow the coming-of-age footsteps of Temujin (Tadanobu Asano) and his older rival Targutai (Amandu Mamadakov) who both strive for power and read the oracles of gods like Tengri, whom they beckon for help.Some of the battles are Trojan-like in thrust.  Temujin will spare no one for Borte (Khulan Chuluun), his lifelong love interest.  Between his patient endurance and his love, Temujin becomes a leader who can match wills with any Mongol tribe.  Going from tribal feuds to a far-reaching dynasty, the film chronicles the real human faces that made history happen.Before becoming Khan, he must master the elements.  Between the harshness of tundra to humiliation and hunger, the sharp edge of life known for bitterly cold winters, make or break the existence of people who rely on their armies, shelter, and horses to survive.It cannot be emphasized enough how the lingering beauty of each frame is arresting enough to justify viewing this two hour and five minute film.  Furthermore, the haunting audio accentuating tribal customs and battle scenes resonate with mesmerizing grandeur.  Although being reserved is perhaps a cultural trait, I felt some of the scenes could have added a bit more zest to the acting, but much of the intensity is non-verbal and convincing indeed.  Writer-director, Sergei Bodrov, deserves heaping praises for building such a tightly built drama and some truly exquisitely shot scenes.Although released last year and up for 2007's Oscar jury, both the cinema and DVD releases came about this year, so it's not too late to hold 'Mongol' as one of the truly worthy epics and one of the best movies to come out all year.A J.P.'s Pick 4.5*'s =Very Good-Exceptional HIGHLY RECOMMENDED",4,"""Do Not Scorn a Weak Cub...""",1224201600,"10 17, 2008",2008,2439,"['Recent', 'Best', 'Foreign', 'Oscar', 'Film', 'nominee', 'Mongol', 'impressive', 'epic', 'Telling', 'first', 'installment', 'life', 'times', 'Ghengis', 'Khan', 'get', 'more', 'history', 'lesson', 'personal', 'account', 'fraternal', 'feud', 'power', 'Filmed', 'breathtaking', 'cinematography', 'sound', 'should', 'have', 'garnered', 'separate', 'nomination', 'movie', 'sweeping', 'drama', 'complete', 'battles', 'make', 'similar', '300', 'scenes', 'obvious', 'digitalized', 'film', 'ahead', 'mostly', 'chronological', 'order', 'several', 'One', 'Year', 'Later', 'other', 'useful', 'captions', 'lose', 'story', 'one', 'man', 'struggle', 'survival', 'Khan', 'love', 'interests', 'shape', 'bind', 'beget', 'tribal', 'rivalries', 'aspirations', 'follow', 'coming-of-age', 'footsteps', 'Temujin', 'Tadanobu', 'Asano', 'older', 'rival', 'Targutai', 'Amandu', 'Mamadakov', 'who', 'strive', 'power', 'read', 'oracles', 'gods', 'Tengri', 'whom', 'beckon', 'help.Some', 'battles', 'are', 'Trojan-like', 'thrust', 'Temujin', 'will', 'spare', 'one', 'Borte', 'Khulan', 'Chuluun', 'lifelong', 'love', 'interest', 'Between', 'patient', 'endurance', 'love', 'Temujin', 'leader', 'who', 'can', 'match', 'wills', 'Mongol', 'tribe', 'Going', 'tribal', 'feuds', 'far-reaching', 'dynasty', 'film', 'real', 'human', 'made', 'history', 'happen.Before', 'becoming', 'Khan', 'must', 'master', 'elements', 'harshness', 'tundra', 'humiliation', 'hunger', 'sharp', 'edge', 'life', 'known', 'bitterly', 'cold', 'winters', 'make', 'break', 'existence', 'people', 'who', 'rely', 'armies', 'shelter', 'horses', 'survive.It', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'emphasized', 'enough', 'how', 'lingering', 'beauty', 'frame', 'arresting', 'enough', 'justify', 'viewing', 'two', 'hour', 'five', 'minute', 'film', 'Furthermore', 'haunting', 'audio', 'accentuating', 'tribal', 'customs', 'battle', 'scenes', 'resonate', 'mesmerizing', 'grandeur', 'being', 'reserved', 'perhaps', 'cultural', 'trait', 'felt', 'scenes', 'could', 'have', 'added', 'bit', 'more', 'zest', 'acting', 'much', 'intensity', 'non-verbal', 'convincing', 'indeed', 'Writer-director', 'Sergei', 'Bodrov', 'heaping', 'praises', 'building', 'tightly', 'built', 'drama', 'truly', 'exquisitely', 'shot', 'scenes.Although', 'released', 'last', 'year', 'up', '2007', 'Oscar', 'jury', 'cinema', 'DVD', 'releases', 'came', 'year', 'not', 'too', 'late', 'hold', ""'Mongol"", 'one', 'truly', 'worthy', 'epics', 'one', 'best', 'movies', 'come', 'out', 'year.A', 'J.P.', 'Pick', '4.5*', '=Very', 'Good-Exceptional', 'HIGHLY', 'RECOMMENDED']",Mongol: The Early Years of Genghis Khan

Therefore, I am reviewing it as entertainment and not an attempt at historical re-creation. I mention this because many people have commented about historical errors in the movie which I find ridiculous because even the foremost expert on Genghis Khan doesn't know precisely how his life unfolded and, once again, this is not a documentary. So, we will move past that altogether.I like movies such as Braveheart, Gladiator, Troy, and Kingdom of Heaven. All big-time movies with big-time actors and budgets. I feel that Mongol fits well into the genre and I enjoyed it as much as any of the aforementioned movies. To echo what others have said, it is as well shot, has as equally impressive costuming, and production values as any of the movies mentioned earlier.

1110085,AQUVTQFFXP4AC,B000WLYDNM,"Andariel Halo ""Disillusioned Smark""","[131, 136]","...but considering the minimal budget (20 million dollars American) and the genuine Mongolian (some areas so isolated that new roads had to be built to get the film crews there) locations filmed, this was a fantastic movie that was well-paced for an introduction to the life of Temudjin, who would become the Genghis Khan.Despite the low budget, nothing in the movie looks cheaply filmed; everything looks like that of a big budget film six times more expensive, from costumes to makeup (and the craggly dirt buildup on Temudjin during his time in captivity).  I don't speak Mongolian, so I can't tell whether the accents spoken are accurately Mongolian, but for an American audience, it was great for authenticity (rather than having them speak Russian or Kazakh).The movie excels in two particular aspects which really make this one more than just a casual ancient-world flick; the battles and the people.While Genghis Khan is demonized in the West as a barbarous conqueror, he is seen like a hero in the East, and this movie serves to show him as both and neither, making him more than just black or white, but a fully fleshed out person with ambitions to uniting all the Mongol tribes as one beneath him.  He is utterly believable as a human being, fallible, and seemingly very much driven by his love for his wife and children, whom he nevertheless must leave constantly to fulfill his dream.There is also Jamukha, who manages to be both a piggish, slothy figure, and a noble, loyal friend to Temudjin, when their dreams conflict and they become enemies, with a very painful and realistic portrayal of just why Jamukha would betray Temudjin, and his lack of joy in facing his opponent on a field of battle.Then there's the battles.  As any Ancient/Medieval war movie to be expected, it is bloody.  My only annoyances in a puritanic-historian way were the suits of armor, which seemed not to be made of much metal as they would have been in Mongolian times.Another minor thing that becomes a little excessive, and arguably rather like a recurring joke is shots of blood, showing them being spilled in thousands of thick drops rather than in fountains or bursts of liquid.The final battle sequence manages to both utilize the Mongolian expertise in archery and cavalry and innovate with something both insanely risky and never before seen in Medieval battle depictions.  Likely seen in the trailer, as Jamukha sends the bulk of his cavalry force at Temudjin's center, he unleashes a very small number of thickly armored cavalry, armed with double curves swords, which then rush through the enemy cavalry, using the swords to slash at the enemy's sides like Scythed Chariots.The armored cavalry is a kamikaze force, as after brutalizing the enemy cavalry, Temudjin has his archers unleash a flood of arrows on the force, killing the cavalry on both sides down to a man.Overall a great movie, which doesn't sacrifice the macro-story of Genghis Khan and his dream of a Mongol empire for the micro-story of Temudjin's love life.

After surviving a number of adventures and occasional setbacks, the young Temudjin positions himself as the future ruler of more than half of Eurasia (the largest empire ever, in terms of its area), Genghis Khan probably comes out as a guy that is a lot nicer than he probably was, and his wife's influence on him appears as improbable in a medieval Asian society (the early scene where as a child he chooses as his bride from a lesser clan, against the wishes of his father, is one of the movie's best).

1110095,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B000WLYDNM,Chris Pandolfi,"[3, 3]","There's a fine line between depictions of war and needless graphic violence, and thankfully, ""Mongol"" doesn't cross it. Yes, moments of this film are brutal and bloody, but they don't overcrowd the film. More than enough room is left for a compelling human drama, a story of love, commitment, and strength in twelfth-century Mongolia. The ads imply that ""Mongol"" is the story of Genghis Khan, but that isn't really the case; this is the story of Temudjin, the boy who would grow up to become Genghis Khan and conquer half the known world. It's about the person, not the myth, and that above all made this a worthwhile experience. Filmed in 2007 but just now getting an American theatrical release, Sergei Bodrov's film is sweeping in its visual and emotional beauty, with cinematography that borders on the sublime and a simple yet significant story.It's the year 1172 at the start of the story proper, and at that point, Temudjin is just nine years old (Odnyam Odsuren). He and his father, a Khan named Esugei (Ba Sen), are traveling from the Steppes of Mongolia to a distant clan because the time has come for Temudjin to choose a wife. When they stop and meet with a different clan, Temudjin meets a ten-year-old girl named Borte (Bayertsetseg Erdenebat); they immediately take a liking to each other, so much so that, by the time he leaves, he chooses her to be his wife. The plan is for Temudjin to return in five years time, at which point the union can be made official. But things take a tragic turn--a rival clan poisons Esugei, and Temudjin and his clan are left at the mercy of a treacherous lieutenant named Targutai (Amadu Mamadakov). Now enslaved and with his father's property forcefully taken, Temudjin vows to someday avenge his father and murder Tergutai.At around this time, a young boy named Jamukha (Amarbold Tuvshinbayar) rescues Temudjin from the desolate cold of the mountains. The two decide to become blood brothers, and right away you can sense the inherent tension in such a union; the cutting of flesh and the spilling of blood is a painful yet deep commitment to someone. Watching the boys drink bowls of milk laced with each other's blood, I sensed something more sinister was lurking on the horizon. You can tell this is true when Jamukha says that someday he'll be Khan and Temudjin will be his Second in Command. Even at a young age, Jamukha sees this union not in terms of loyalty and respect, but in terms of power. What's really interesting is that Temudjin was most likely seduced by the same lust, considering his transformation into Genghis Khan. Consider the moment he goes to the Sacred Mountain to pray to Tengri, the God of the Blue Sky: a lone gray wolf appears, symbolic not only of Tengri, but also of destructive power.The story eventually flashes forward to the year 1186, at which point a grown Temudjin (Tadanobu Asano) escapes enslavement and reunites with Borte (Khulan Chuluun), who has been longing for his return ever since the day they met. Despite the fact that they love each other deeply, they're constantly driven apart by battle--sometimes Borte is kidnapped while at other times Temudjin is forced to leave her so that he can fight. The theme of loyalty comes into its own at this stage of the story: while Temudjin and Borte remain devoted to each other, Temudjin and Jamukha (Honglei Sun) have now divided themselves. The idea of friends becoming enemies is certainly not new, especially in stories of civil war and bloodshed. There is, however, a subtlety to their downfall that I greatly appreciated, a slow and steady unraveling that made it all the more believable. I won't delve too deeply into this, but I will say that Temudjin's belief that generous leaders gain a larger following is a wise one. This is something Jamukha doesn't seem to understand.Some viewers might be disappointed that Temudjin doesn't actually become Genghis Khan by the end of this movie; it's not about his reign, but about his rise to power. There's a reason for this: ""Mongol"" is the first part of an epic trilogy. There's really no way of knowing how accurate this story is, seeing as Genghis Khan has generally been remembered as a ruthless warrior. ""His history was written by his enemies,"" Sergei Bodrov said when interviewed, and I have no doubt that this is true. Many elements of the screenplay seemed to come straight out of a fable: a man who comes from nothing but gains everything; a woman who often finds herself in distress; a friendship that turns into a rivalry. It's hard to imagine something so formulaic being drawn from the pages of history.This isn't to say that ""Mongol"" ever goes in the wrong direction. You watch this movie feeling utterly captivated by the story, the characters, and the look, all of which mutually benefit each other. Even the bloodstained battle scenes have a beauty of their own, albeit not in the conventional sense; slow motion shots of swords flying and blood spurting are expertly captured, pretty much to the point of seeming graceful. But at its core, ""Mongol"" is about the characters and how they love, hate, honor, and betray one another. As bland as that sounds, it actually helps a great deal because it allows today's audiences to relate to it, to understand why certain things happen. It's a shame virtually no one in the United States got to see this film a year ago, before it nominated for Best Foreign Language Film. It would have been wonderful to praise it along with the Academy.",5,The Wrath of Khan,1214179200,"06 23, 2008",2008,5491,"['fine', 'line', 'depictions', 'war', 'needless', 'graphic', 'violence',

1110096,A3E0IFPCA7KKP9,B000WLYDNM,Christopher J. Martin,"[1, 1]","This movie was as good as I'd heard it was supposed to be when it was in limited release in theaters. It traces the beginning of the rise of Genghis Khan, whose real name was Temudgin. I cannot vouch for all of the historical accuracy, but it really seems like the film makers attempted to be as accurate as possible to whatever is historically known about Temudgin's early life. The scenes on the Mongolian steppe are simply amazing.There are gaps in the story which sometimes are confusing, which also leads me to believe that those gaps were intentionally left there, because we just don't know what happened during certain periods of Temudgin's early life. For example, in one scene he leaves his wife and children to unite the Mongols. He is seen on the scared mountain praying and asking his god for help to unite the people under basic laws. In the next scene he has an army of hundreds, if not thousands, of men and ready to face off in a final showdown against his blood brother, whom he met years earlier as a child. Unfortunately the movie doesn't explain how he got this large army.One thing that the movie does extremely well is to explain Genghis Khan wasn't just a mythic warrior figure who laid waste to everything he came across. He was a man, and part of the reason for his success is that he cared for his people. In one early scene, his army wins a battle. Instead of taking all of the plunder for himself, he only takes 1/10th of a share and tells his army to divide the rest amongst themselves, but not to forget the families of those who died in battle. This, it seems, is the real secret to his success. He was not simply a warrior, he was an early politician that knew the secret of his success came from having the support of his people.This is an extremely well done movie. I appreciated the fact the film makers used an all Mongolian cast and did not simply use American or Japanese actors who might have ""looked Mongolian."" The use of subtitles also did not take away one bit from the movie.I really hope that the planned two more movies to complete the story of Genghis Khan's life are done as well as this one.",5,Excellent Movie...I hope there's more!,1241308800,"05 3, 2009",2009,2141,"['movie', 'was', 'as', 'good', ""'d"", 'heard', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'when', 'was', 'limited', 'release', 'theaters', 'beginning', 'rise', 'Genghis', 'Khan', 'real', 'name', 'was', 'Temudgin', 'can', 'not', 'vouch', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'really', 'film', 'makers', 'attempted', 'be', 'as', 'accurate', 'possible', 'historically', 'known', 'Temudgin', 'early', 'life', 'scenes', 'Mongolian', 'steppe', 'are', 'simply', 'amazing.There', 'are', 'gaps', 'story', 'sometimes', 'are', 'confusing', 'also', 'believe', 'gaps', 'were', 'intentionally', 'left', 'there', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'happened', 'certain', 'periods', 'Temudgin', 'early', 'life', 'example', 'one', 'scene', 'wife', 'children', 'unite', 'Mongols', 'seen', 'scared', 'mountain', 'praying', 'asking', 'god', 'help', 'unite', 'people', 'basic', 'laws', 'next', 'scene', 'army', 'hundreds', 'not', 'thousands', 'men', 'ready', 'face', 'off', 'final', 'showdown', 'blood', 'brother', 'whom', 'met', 'years', 'earlier', 'child', 'Unfortunately', 'movie', ""n't"", 'explain', 'how', 'got', 'large', 'army.One', 'thing', 'movie', 'extremely', 'well', 'explain', 'Genghis', 'Khan', 'was', ""n't"", 'just', 'mythic', 'warrior', 'figure', 'who', 'laid', 'waste', 'everything', 'came', 'across', 'was', 'man', 'part', 'reason', 'success', 'cared', 'people', 'one', 'early', 'scene', 'army', 'battle', 'Instead', 'taking', 'plunder', 'only', '1/10th', 'share', 'army', 'divide', 'rest', 'amongst', 'not', 'forget', 'families', 'who', 'died', 'battle', 'real', 'secret', 'success', 'was', 'not', 'simply', 'warrior', 'was', 'early', 'politician', 'knew', 'secret', 'success', 'came', 'having', 'support', 'people.This', 'extremely', 'well', 'done', 'movie', 'appreciated', 'fact', 'film', 'makers', 'used', 'Mongolian', 'cast', 'did', 'not', 'simply', 'use', 'American', 'Japanese', 'actors', 'who', 'might', 'have', 'looked', 'Mongolian', 'use', 'subtitles', 'also', 'did', 'not', 'take', 'away', 'one', 'bit', 'movie.I', 'really', 'hope', 'planned', 'two', 'more', 'movies', 'complete', 'story', 'Genghis', 'Khan', 'life', 'are', 'done', 'as', 'well', 'one']",Mongol: The Early Years of Genghis Khan
1110097,A3SFO2GSP5CVSM,B000WLYDNM,"Cosmoetica ""cosmoeticadotcom""","[1, 4]","This film was somehow nominated for Best Foreign Film at the 2007 Academy Awards, and one has to believe it's only because of its subject matter and the fact of its provenance, because its artistic quality is simply not high. In many ways, it's a B film masquerading as an A film, and one need merely to compare it to earlier epics like Ben-Hur, Spartacus, and El Cid, to see where this film went wrong, in terms of acting, writing, and the eschewing of realism for video game level special effects (the final battle scene between Jamukha's and Temjin's forces, replete with darkening skies) is especially silly.The DVD, put out by New Line Cinema, is utterly bare bones. Yet, this is the sort of DVD that screams for needing a commentary and/or a making of featurette, and a documentary on the historical Genghis Khan. Not that such could have justified the film's failings, but they could have at least shed light onto why certain things in the film were portrayed a certain way. While a film historian's commentary would be nice, even more elucidating would have been a scholar of the Mongol Empire and/or the Ancient Orient to discuss the schism between the film's reality and that history bears. As it is, Mongol: The Rise Of Genghis Khan, is a mess of a film- intriguing enough in its pros and historical import, to get a mild recommendation for viewing, but too Hollywood in its screenplay deficiencies and logic to recommend with much fervor.

1110098,A39CX0EE4BZCZC,B000WLYDNM,Craig Connell,"[17, 20]","The most pleasing part of this film, I thought, was the excellent cinematography. Kudos to Roger Stoffers and Sergei Trofimov for an outstanding job photographing this movie, making the most bleak of landscapes look stunning many times and adding some wonderful closeup shots of objects and faces.It's not a bad story, either, although not one that will keep you riveted to the screen for the full two hours. However, I wasn't bored, either, although some of the action scenes looked too repetitive with very hokey-looking special-effects concerning blood splashing out of people in the battle scenes. It did not look real, but as if it were drawn. It's ironic in that the production values seem to be so high with a such a nicely-filmed effort, yet the action scenes are staged like a B-movie.In a nutshell, this is the story of how ""Genghis Kahn,"" who is ""Temudjin"" throughout the movie, spent his tough early life and how he became the famous warrior. We just see how many hardships the man endured to become who he was later in life. He was never referred to as Genghis Kahn which, I learned hear, is a title more than a name. That must have come later, after he had control of all the Mongol armies, which is where the film ends.Many times, it's a not a pleasant existence for ""Temudjin,"" who was marked man from the age of nine. We see him spend many lonely hours held captive in different places. The looks on his face are memorable. Odnyam Odsuren ad the young ""Temudjin"" and Tadanobu Asano as the adult ""Temudjin"" both had extraordinarily photographic faces.One of the few problems I had with the movie were understanding ""the rest of the story"" as certain scenes ended abruptly leaving me (and I assume other viewers) wondering ""what happened?"" His friends, though, were fun to watch and his bride was a beautiful, kind and strong woman, as pictured in this movie. Actually, I found this just as much of a love story as a war epic, and the romance angle was far more dramatic. The devotion the lead male and female had to each other, and the faithfulness and loyalty were inspiring, to say the least.",3,Memorable Photography Highlights Story Of 'Temudjin',1231977600,"01 15, 2009",2009,2110,"['most', 'pleasing', 'part', 'film', 'thought', 'was', 'excellent', 'cinematography', 'Kudos', 'Roger', 'Stoffers', 'Sergei', 'Trofimov', 'outstanding', 'job', 'photographing', 'movie', 'making', 'most', 'bleak', 'landscapes', 'look', 'stunning', 'many', 'times', 'adding', 'wonderful', 'closeup', 'shots', 'objects', 'faces.It', 'not', 'bad', 'story', 'either', 'not', 'one', 'will', 'keep', 'riveted', 'screen', 'full', 'two', 'hours', 'However', 'was', ""n't"", 'bored', 'either', 'action', 'scenes', 'looked', 'too', 'repetitive', 'very', 'hokey-looking', 'special-effects', 'concerning', 'blood', 'splashing', 'people', 'battle', 'scenes', 'did', 'not', 'look', 'real', 'were', 'drawn', 'ironic', 'production', 'values', 'seem', 'be', 'so', 'high', 'such', 'nicely-filmed', 'effort', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'staged', 'B-movie.In', 'nutshell', 'story', 'how', 'Genghis', 'Kahn', 'who', 'Temudjin', 'movie', 'spent', 'tough', 'early', 'life', 'how', 'became', 'famous', 'warrior', 'just', 'see', 'how', 'many', 'hardships', 'man', 'endured', 'become', 'who', 'was', 'later', 'life', 'was', 'never', 'referred', 'Genghis', 'Kahn', 'learned', 'hear', 'title', 'more', 'name', 'must', 'have', 'come', 'later', 'had', 'control', 'Mongol', 'armies', 'where', 'film', 'ends.Many', 'times', 'not', 'pleasant', 'existence', 'Temudjin', 'who', 'was', 'marked', 'man', 'age', 'nine', 'see', 'spend', 'many', 'lonely', 'hours', 'held', 'captive', 'different', 'places', 'looks', 'face', 'are', 'memorable', 'Odnyam', 'Odsuren', 'ad', 'young', 'Temudjin', 'Tadanobu', 'Asano', 'adult', 'Temudjin', 'had', 'extraordinarily', 'photographic', 'faces.One', 'few', 'problems', 'had', 'movie', 'were', 'understanding', 'rest', 'story', 'certain', 'scenes', 'ended', 'abruptly', 'leaving', 'assume', 'other', 'viewers', 'wondering', 'what', 'happened', 'friends', 'though', 'were', 'fun', 'watch', 'bride', 'was', 'beautiful', 'kind', 'strong', 'woman', 'pictured', 'movie', 'Actually', 'found', 'just', 'much', 'love', 'story', 'war', 'epic', 'romance', 'angle', 'was', 'far', 'more', 'dramatic', 'devotion', 'lead', 'male', 'female', 'had', 'other', 'faithfulness', 'loyalty', 'were', 'inspiring', 'say', 'least']",Mongol: The Early Years of Genghis Khan

At the age of nine, Temudjin's father(Esugei), the khan at the time, shows him how to pick a wife. After doing so, the plan is for them to get married in five years. After Esugei is poisoned however, he dies and the Mongols he was travelling with take matters into their own hands. Pillaging and doing whatever they see fit. Temudjin becomes a slave and sets out to find his brother, Jamukha, who he feels is the only one who can help him. A few years pass. Temudjin, now a man, sets off to claim his wife. He winds up going through a lot of hardships in the process, but what doesn't kill you will only make you stronger. It is said that all Mongols are afraid of thunder, but what if they don't have a place to hide? They become one of the greatest Mongols in history and greatness comes to those who take it.This movie is shot beautifully. Every shot is filled with vibrant colors and seems to be shot in a unique way. There are quite a few first person perspectives during battle sequences that are quite stunning. Seeing the blood splatter all over the camera is always a plus, in my eyes. The battle scenes are where the film truly shines. The way they're shot make you feel like you're in the middle of it all. The perspective on a lot of the angles during not only the battle sequences, but in the movie as a whole, are impressive in their own right. The music also lends a helping hand in making this movie incredible. While some of it wasn't to my liking, the majority of it fit the film like a glove and only enhanced what was going on in the film and what the characters were going through.The main reason I checked out this movie was because of Tadanobu Asano. I've mentioned my admiration of his acting in the past, but I had heard that this was possibly the most physical role he ever had. That peaked my interest. Well that and the fact that he was headlining the film. He definitely doesn't disappoint in this and he only seems to impress me more with each film I see that he's involved with.Mongol may not be as action packed as the trailer leads you to believe. There are a handful of really impressive action scenes, but there's a lot of character development in this as well. The acting is top notch and as I mentioned, the visuals will have your eyes glued to the screen the entire time. I think the last twenty minutes or so make this film worth seeing alone. While it isn't action packed for two hours straight, I like to think that if you're a fan of movies like 300 then you'll probably enjoy this.

There is an interesting parallel in this film to Gladiator as both heroes seek to return and avenge their loss but as in gladiator, in a broader sense to restore order in governing. In the case of Genghis, a centralized Mongolian empire with a unifying code of conduct centered on Genghis' fair treatment of soldiers and for those that suffer his conquest.  Tadanobu Asano, Genghis,  is considered by some as the Japanese Johnny Depp as he is an excellent actor and has a presence that requires no verbalization. The only negative in the film is that it fast forwards from Genghis' return from prison with no one but himself to the climatic scene showing him suddenly with an established army. Showing how warriors rallied to him, would have been a plus. The movie is in subtitles but that actually adds to the film since dubbing would have ruined the film.

The story is too fragmentary and too historically dubious/wrong to warrant any consideration (what is there comes across as bad soap opera).The problems with the (fortunately brief) battle scenes were apparent to everyone, causing complaints to be hurled as the screen.  Since nonsensical battle scenes are so routine in movies, this reaction suggests that people expected better (higher standards) from this movie.What would be major problems in other movies are trivial transient annoyances, and even that disappeared when I treated the biographic scenes as simply slice-of-life.  With that, those scenes became satisfying, contributing to the overall movie.  That is, treat the title of the movie as just ""Mongol"", with no mention of Genghis Khan.  However, you probably won't want to completely ignore the subtitles, so keep your remote handy to rewind after reading them so that you can appreciate the visuals.Unlike many DVDs, this one needs to be treated as if you are in a theater: settle in to a comfortable seat and prepare to be immersed (Oh, and turn off your cell phone :-) ).",5,"Spectacular Cinematography, bad script irrelevant",1230076800,"12 24, 2008",2008,1320,"['watched', 'friends', 'wide', 'range', 'tastes', 'universal', 'reaction', 'was', 'Wow', 'end', 'assessment', 'was', 'should', 'let', 'visuals', 'wash', 'not', 'try', 'make', 'sense', 'narrative', 'story', 'too', 'fragmentary', 'too', 'historically', 'dubious/wrong', 'warrant', 'consideration', 'what', 'there', 'across', 'bad', 'soap', 'opera', 'problems', 'fortunately', 'brief', 'battle', 'scenes', 'were', 'apparent', 'everyone', 'causing', 'complaints', 'be', 'hurled', 'screen', 'nonsensical', 'battle', 'scenes', 'are', 'so', 'routine', 'movies', 'reaction', 'people', 'expected', 'better', 'higher', 'standards', 'would', 'be', 'major', 'problems', 'other', 'movies', 'are', 'trivial', 'transient', 'annoyances', 'even', 'disappeared', 'when', 'treated', 'biographic', 'scenes', 'simply', 'slice-of-life', 'scenes', 'became', 'satisfying', 'contributing', 'overall', 'movie', 'treat', 'title', 'movie', 'just', 'Mongol', 'mention', 'Genghis', 'Khan', 'However', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'want', 'completely', 'ignore', 'subtitles', 'so', 'keep', 'remote', 'handy', 'rewind', 'reading', 'so', 'can', 'appreciate', 'visuals.Unlike', 'many', 'DVDs', 'one', 'be', 'treated', 'are', 'theater', 'settle', 'comfortable', 'seat', 'prepare', 'be', 'immersed', 'Oh', 'turn', 'off', 'cell', 'phone']",Mongol: The Early Years of Genghis Khan

We are not likely to get on a tour bus to visit these remote places, so the Blu-ray is next best for the foreseeable future.  At 9.99 for the ""Mongol"" Blu-ray at the date of this review, and 14.99 for the dvd, there is something weird about the pricing.This movie looks fictional to a large degree.  I can believe the dates.  Even with a modern almanac, the animal cycles allows one to extrapolate backwards to the exact year.  No need for the ""circa"" when the exact year can be calculated accurately.1196 AD: the year of the politically correct Blu-ray.  The Khan's wife chooses the man and saves him from death more than a couple of times.  Without his wife running the show, Genghis Khan is just another dead mongol.Like ""Alexander"", this movie is short on the tactics of battle.  It does not explain clearly how an numerically inferior force repeatedly defeated a superior force.  I remain curious.  ""300"", ""Midway"" and ""Patton"" clearly illustrate the tactics used.There are sufficient battle scenes, but not enough for me.  In ""Braveheart"", Mel Gibson's captain remarked: we did not get dressed up for nothing.  In ""Mongol"", the hordes are dressed up and assembled.  Battle scenes could have been extended and made more dramatic.  What a waste of good cavalry.""Nomad: the warrior"" (Jay Hernandez) would be an apt companion to ""Mongol"" when released on BD.  ""Nomad"" is produced with the full co-operation of the Khazakhstan government.  ""Nomad"" goes a long way to restore our respect for Khazak culture after ""Borat"" defamed Khazakhstan.  It goes to show that a movie can do a lot more for public perception than 3 page advertisements in the New York Times taken out by the Khazak government.  ""Mongol"" likewise changed perception of Genghis Khan.  ""Nomad"" is more entertaining than the pseudo-historical ""Mongol"", but ""Mongol"" was there first on Blu-ray.All things considered, ""Mongol"" is a worthwhile addition to a BD collection.

1110105,A1E6JS6C205VZD,B000WLYDNM,Dr. Laurence Raw,"[0, 0]","Some reviewers have referred to the fact that MONGOL: THE RISE OF GENGHIS KHAN is a low-budget epic, as compared to its Hollywood equivalents.  What makes this film so outstanding is its un-likeness to the Hollywood product; rather than focusing on special effects, Sergey Bodrov's film centers on Temudjin (Tadanobu Asano) and the way in which he develops the kind of iron will that transforms him into a great leader.  Although repeatedly captured by his enemies, including arch-bad guy Jamukha (Honglei Sun), he always finds a way out to return to his wife Borte (Khulan Chuluun), with a combination of brute force and low cunning.  Structurally speaking, MONGOL: THE RISE OF GENGHIS KHAN is structured around a series of conflicts between various factions in twelfth century Mongolia, each vying for power.  The prestige attached to being called &#34;Khan&#34; is so great that it attracts rival leader Targutai (Amadu Mamadakov) - although he repeatedly describes Temudjin as his brother, we know that this is a term of convenience.  Bodrov's film contains some stunning landscape shots: filmed in the wilds of Mongolia, as well as Kazakhstan, this is a visual feast, making us aware of how insignificant human beings can be when set against the world they inhabit.

""Mongol"" tells how the young Temujin rose to become the greatest Khan of the Mongol Empire. It has the epic feel of ""Lawrence of Arabia"" and the brutal warfare of ""Braveheart"". It's also ponderous in a way that you get to see and feel the magnificent scenery. It's a beautiful film, and it certainly deserved the oscar nomination for Best Foreign Film. The only complaint I have with this DVD is that it has no special features whatsoever (no deleted scenes, no commentary, no nothing).

It has absolutely no intellectual content and precious little plausibility, unless you happen to believe in soothsayers and Gods of Lightning. It's one of those ""River Platte"" films, three miles wide and three inches deep. Most of the rave reviews focus on the cinematography, especially of the Mongolian landscape. Even the visual beauty of the film is nothing worth five stars; it doesn't compare with any number of Japanese, Swedish, Italian, or even American films, the old classic ""Shane"" for instance, which was shot in the Grand Tetons region. The camera work is grand but unimaginative. For a contrast, I'd suggest the films of another Russian director: Sergei Paradjanov! His budgets were infinitesimal in comparison to ""Mongol"" but his cinematography was a hundred times more creative.The acting is remarkably supple and convincing, given the banality of the script. Let me reassure you that Japanese actor Asano Tabanobu is way more plausible as Genghis Khan than American actor John Wayne ever was. But you'll have to indulge in some ""willing suspension"" of cultural incredulity in order to relish the mythic impassivity and imperturbality of the Mongols as portrayed here.The battle scenes are comic book stuff. They're about as realistic as the semi-animated film ""300"" portraying the Battle of Thermopylae. It's hard to imagine that anybody really enjoys such silly showers of simulated gore. In the old-time cowboy-and-cattle-rustler films, a bullet would kill a man instantly, without a speck of blood or a twitch on the ground; this film, which is just an ethnographic ""western"" at heart, reduces death to the opposite absurdity. Men get slashed in half, despite their armor, and fake blood erupts in fountains.

1110112,A1RMWCN45F0PF9,B000WLYDNM,"J. A. Eyon ""Little Raven""","[9, 15]","Not a film for viewers expecting lotsa violent battles. Not a film for those expecting an objective biography.This film, by Russian writer/director Sergei Bodrov, is a ponderous biography of Temujin (spelled 'Temudgin' in the movie) before he became the great Genghis Khan.Despite my rating, I sat almost transfixed cuz I've long been interested in Genghis Khan. Here, Bodrov and his team gave an authentic look and feel to the people and the place -- in the midst of the most breathtaking Mongolian landscapes.The look and feel is helped by the apparent use of legitimate Mongols in the cast who are probably making their first and only appearance in a movie. The young woman playing Temujin's wife, Khulan Chuluun, does a decent job. Japanese actor Tadanobu Asano as the mature Temujin is appropriately inscrutable and looks like the iconic images of the man. Then there's the full-blooded presence of Chinese actor Honglei Sun who steals the film as Temujin's blood brother Jamulke.But I found myself bothered by several elements.There's large dose of revisionism here. It's as if Bodrov wants to say: Genghis Khan wasn't all that bad -- his actions can be explained by his suffering at the hands of his enemies -- and he brought a code of justice to his people (however flimsy) -- and, most important of all, he loved and was loved by his main wife. That's how the story was shaped. Of course, it's easier to sympathize with Temujin the Victim than with Genghis Khan the Savage Conquerer, which we don't get to see.The story as presented here differs in large chunks from the versions I'm familiar with (the insightful story of Temujin's murder of his half-brother is missing -- and Temujin a prisoner of the Chinese?!). But I can't call it unfaithful to history since details of Genghis Khan's early life is pretty much lost to history except for a somewhat unreliable narrative produced by the Mongols sometime after his death (""Secret History of the Mongols""). So writers can embellish all they want.There's a touch of the supernatural which in a honest biography wouldn't be included. In this mixed-bag of a movie, it fits.The clich&eacute;d battle scenes are stolen from many recent bravado films set in the past. Except, the CGI is less convincing than usual (I don't think I've ever seen more fakey blood spattering).Still I managed to be engrossed -- but you might not be.

1110113,A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ,B000WLYDNM,Jason,"[2, 2]","From scale to score, from acting to cinematography, from plotline to quality, Mongol is every bit as amazing and epic asBraveheart.  It's truly remarkable how closely the two movies resemble one another.  In my opinion, Braveheart is one of the best movies of the past twenty years, and no higher praise can be given.As a young boy Temudgin (played brilliantly in adult years by Tadanobu Asano) learns from his father, the khan.  Bowing to his god Tengri, all of the customs of Mongol culture are passed down.  His father believes that finding a bride is one of the measures of a man, and as a nine year old, Temudgin takes Borte (Khulan Chuluun) as his own.  But when his father is killed by deceitful enemy offering a false peace offering, Temudgin must fend for himself at an early age.  After his father's death, he soon bonds with a loyal friend in early childhood - a relationship that both saves and curses him later in life.  As the years progress, he transforms from vulnerable young Mongol boy into a vibrant, unmatched warrior who causes equal parts fear and envy in all those view him.  His dream of a united Mongolian force is yet another threat which may separate clans.Visually speaking, I have never seen a more beautiful movie.  Bountiful green valleys, oxbows snaking back and forth, barren grasslands so lifeless that their appearance alone kills wildlife, exploding mountain ranges climbing over one another, massive white snow banks that extend to the horizon and beyond into blindness; enough credit cannot be given.  At time the wide sweeping scenes are reminiscent ofThe Lord Of The Rings, and at others the use of lighting and landscape rivals any picture captured on screen.  For the cinematography and artistic quality alone, this movie is worth a viewing.One part warring clans of Braveheart, one part suffering slave trade ofApocalypto, this movie is every bit a tour de force that is nearly incomparable except to other visual masterpieces that take a few hours to watch but several months to forget.  With blades so sharp a single swipe cuts to the bone, the battles between Mongol armies are a spectacle on par with300.  While not as awe-inspiring as the film work, the battles provide enough to entice the most hardcore, bloodthirsty warfare zealot.I'm not sure how accurate the history is, but if Genghis Khan were alive and able approve of his biography, I'm sure he'd be pleased with the results.",5,As good as Braveheart,1240790400,"04 27, 2009",2009,2432,"['scale', 'score', 'acting', 'cinematography', 'plotline', 'quality', 'Mongol', 'bit', 'amazing', 'epic', 'asBraveheart', 'truly', 'remarkable', 'how', 'closely', 'two', 'movies', 'resemble', 'one', 'opinion', 'Braveheart', 'one', 'best', 'movies', 'past', 'twenty', 'years', 'higher', 'praise', 'can', 'be', 'given.As', 'young', 'boy', 'Temudgin', 'played', 'brilliantly', 'adult', 'years', 'Tadanobu', 'Asano', 'father', 'khan', 'Bowing', 'god', 'Tengri', 'customs', 'Mongol', 'culture', 'are', 'passed', 'down', 'father', 'finding', 'bride', 'one', 'measures', 'man', 'nine', 'year', 'old', 'Temudgin', 'Borte', 'Khulan', 'Chuluun', 'own', 'when', 'father', 'killed', 'deceitful', 'enemy', 'offering', 'false', 'peace', 'offering', 'Temudgin', 'must', 'fend', 'early', 'age', 'father', 'death', 'soon', 'bonds', 'loyal', 'friend', 'early', 'childhood', 'relationship', 'saves', 'later', 'life', 'years', 'progress', 'vulnerable', 'young', 'Mongol', 'boy', 'vibrant', 'unmatched', 'warrior', 'who', 'equal', 'parts', 'fear', 'envy', 'view', 'dream', 'united', 'Mongolian', 'force', 'yet', 'threat', 'may', 'separate', 'clans.Visually', 'speaking', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'more', 'beautiful', 'movie', 'Bountiful', 'green', 'valleys', 'snaking', 'back', 'forth', 'barren', 'grasslands', 'so', 'lifeless', 'appearance', 'alone', 'wildlife', 'exploding', 'mountain', 'ranges', 'climbing', 'one', 'massive', 'white', 'snow', 'banks', 'extend', 'horizon', 'blindness', 'enough', 'credit', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'given', 'time', 'wide', 'sweeping', 'scenes', 'are', 'reminiscent', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'others', 'use', 'lighting', 'landscape', 'rivals', 'picture', 'captured', 'screen', 'cinematography', 'artistic', 'quality', 'alone', 'movie', 'viewing.One', 'part', 'warring', 'clans', 'Braveheart', 'one', 'part', 'suffering', 'slave', 'trade', 'ofApocalypto', 'movie', 'bit', 'tour', 'de', 'force', 'nearly', 'incomparable', 'other', 'visual', 'masterpieces', 'take', 'few', 'hours', 'watch', 'several', 'months', 'forget', 'blades', 'so', 'sharp', 'single', 'swipe', 'cuts', 'bone', 'battles', 'Mongol', 'armies', 'are', 'spectacle', 'par', 'with300', 'not', 'as', 'awe-inspiring', 'film', 'work', 'battles', 'provide', 'enough', 'entice', 'most', 'hardcore', 'bloodthirsty', 'warfare', 'zealot.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'accurate', 'history', 'Genghis', 'Khan', 'were', 'alive', 'able', 'approve', 'biography', ""'m"", 'sure', ""'d"", 'be', 'pleased', 'results']",Mongol: The Early Years of Genghis Khan

There were other parts I really liked, finding my imagination captured, even distantly recalling scenes from ""Conan The Barbarian"" (father & son scene discussing their god).Also, please note, I want to clarify that I'm sensitive to the notion that Asian actors might be perceived by someone like me (a caucasian American) as lacking in range of emotion and facial expressions, and perhaps that's a better alternative to over acting. But with Temudjin's grown-up ""Brother""/turned-enemy showcasing a livelier character, I was left wishing for more from Temudjin himself. Also, the transition of Temudjin from childhood to suddenly +40 year old actor was a filmmaker's faux pas.A movie true to the tale, or in need of a script revision? I am undecided. Lastly, in some spots I felt the fight scenes were not up to the standard of story telling quality as the rest of the film, especially when he tosses the spear into a victim who suddenly springs backwards, and the computer animated blood effects seemed a little off in color. I'm probably being way too picky, but as much as I tried to embrace this movie, I found myself yawning and picking up on the little details.",2,"A Good Time Piece, I suppose",1232496000,"01 21, 2009",2009,1439,"['Mongol', 'movie', 'reviewOne', 'part', 'violence', 'one', 'part', 'authentic', 'stunning', 'visual', 'cinematography', 'unfortunately', 'one', 'part', 'boring', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'overly', 'critical', 'found', 'managing', 'parts', 'movie', 'seemed', 'sleepy', 'unengaging', 'oddly', 'repetitive', 'were', 'other', 'parts', 'really', 'liked', 'finding', 'imagination', 'captured', 'even', 'distantly', 'recalling', 'scenes', 'Conan', 'Barbarian', 'son', 'scene', 'discussing', 'god', '.Also', 'please', 'note', 'want', 'clarify', ""'m"", 'sensitive', 'notion', 'Asian', 'actors', 'might', 'be', 'perceived', 'someone', 'caucasian', 'American', 'lacking', 'range', 'emotion', 'facial', 'expressions', 'perhaps', 'better', 'alternative', 'acting', 'Temudjin', 'grown-up', 'Brother', '/turned-enemy', 'showcasing', 'livelier', 'character', 'was', 'left', 'wishing', 'more', 'Temudjin', 'Also', 'transition', 'Temudjin', 'childhood', 'suddenly', '+40', 'year', 'old', 'actor', 'was', 'filmmaker', 'faux', 'pas.A', 'movie', 'true', 'tale', 'need', 'script', 'revision', 'am', 'undecided', 'Lastly', 'spots', 'felt', 'fight', 'scenes', 'were', 'not', 'up', 'standard', 'story', 'telling', 'quality', 'rest', 'film', 'especially', 'when', 'spear', 'victim', 'who', 'suddenly', 'backwards', 'computer', 'animated', 'blood', 'effects', 'seemed', 'little', 'off', 'color', ""'m"", 'probably', 'being', 'way', 'too', 'picky', 'as', 'much', 'tried', 'embrace', 'movie', 'found', 'yawning', 'picking', 'up', 'little', 'details']",Mongol: The Early Years of Genghis Khan

Polhemus ""Book Collector""","[1, 3]","Everything about an epic is done on grand scale: It is a work of art that crosses a great expanse of land, involves several generations, and focuses on the life of a great hero and including magic and great feats. ""Mongol"" certainly meets this definition. Temudjin is not yet a hero, but by the end of the film, the viewer sees this man rise from year after year of personal defeat to becoming Mongolia's greatest leader, indeed, one of history's greatest leaders.Add to the basic story line taken directly from the mists of history when little was recorded of this particular hero is a cast and crew of epic proportions. Sergei Bodrov, the director, is Russian; Tadanobu Asamo, who plays Temudjin, is Japanese, and Khulan Chuluun, or Borte, Temudjin's hand-picked wife, was picked by the director from the streets of a city in Mongolia. Sun Honglei, who plays Jamukha, the blood brother, is Chinese.The story follows history accurately, as best is known. As another reviewer did, I also want to compare this film with ""Genghis Khan: To the End of the Earth and Sea,"" directed by Shinichiro Sawai, a Japanese, with Takashi Sorimachi, a Japanese actor in the title role. ""Mongol"" may have been nominated for an Academy Award for Best Foreign Film, but I tip my hat to ""Genghis Khan"" for a more detailed story and a better understanding of characters across the board: Temujin, Borte, the mother, the blood brother.The major difference between the two films is the story of the man and wife. As young children, she picked him as husband, convincing him to pick her. Against his father's wishes, he does so. His father the Khan was in the process of arranging a marriage with an enemy clan to heal enmity. Years later once they are wed, she is stolen from him by an enemy clan. In a most unusual battle in a most unusual place, Temudjin rescues his bride, binding them forever. An incident breaches the trust issue of the two blood brothers, which is never healed (two of Jamukha's best warriors go with Temudjin. According to this film, Temudjin first starts making up Mongol rules at this point. He tells Jamukha that ""Mongols are free to choose their leader.""When he is captured, Borte moves mountain and stream to free him. Well, not exactly, but close to it. At one point when he leaves her to go start Mongolia, he tells her he will always come back. And he does.""Mongol"" is more a minimalist film to reflect the minimalist setting in which the story is placed--wide open vistas, huge panoramas with mountainous scenery always in the distance. Any time Temudjun appears on the open plains, he runs (if he doesn't have a horse--A Mongol always rides his horse), as if to say, one cannot get anywhere if he doesn't run.Even though ""Genghis Khan"" is filmed in similar territory, there is a greater sense of detail--in clothing, habitat, and story. At the end the Disney figure of Mulan appears in the story as a lead soldier in Genghis's army.If you liked ""Mongol,"" seeGenghis Khan: To the Ends of the Earth and Seafor a little different version of the same story.

Directed by Russian director Sergei Bodrav, it was co-produced by companies in Kazakhstan and Mongolia and  is the first part of a planned three-part series.Mongol is about the early years of the famed Genghis Khan. During his lifetime (from 1162 to 1227) his Mongol Empire eventually occupied most of Asia.  Later, his descendants went on to stretch the Mongol Empire across most of Eurasia, including all of modern China as well as substantial portions of Russia, Southern Asia, Eastern Europe and the Middle East.The story starts when the young Genghis Khan (then called Tomudgen) was nine years old.  He and his father and a small group of warriors felt it was time for him to find a bride.  They traveled to a neighboring nomadic camp and here he met ten-year-old Botte.  In spite of the fact that his father wanted him to choose his bride from a different tribe, Tomudgen insisted on Botte.  They were betrothed and plans were made for Tomudgen to return in five years to claim her.However, on the way back home, his father was poisoned by enemies and young Tomudgen was taken prisoner and received harsh treatment.  He escaped however and was befriended by another boy who later grew up to first be his friend and later his enemy.The film is comprised of almost non-stop violence.  There's a huge cast of warriors for the many battle scenes.  Blood flows, and after a while it does get boring.  But there is also a fair share of torture to break the monotony.  Eventually, Botte and Tomudgen marry but she is captured by a warlord, and it takes him two years to rescue her.  They are separated again later and this time it is she who rescues him.  Most of the time this story held my interest but I would have preferred the battle scenes to be shorter.  There is just so much spurting blood I can take.This is in no way a great film.  There is so much violence that is soon becomes meaningless.  And there are a few parts that stretch the imagination just too much, such as the time that the young Tomudgen falls though the ice in the middle of winter and miraculously survives and another time that he fights off a pack of wild dogs after years of being kept captive as a slave.  Certainly, this is not a film for everyone and I can only give it a very mild recommended.However, I must say that I am looking forward to the sequel.",3,"Blood flows, and after a while it gets a little boring.",1215820800,"07 12, 2008",2008,2513,"['2007', 'film', 'nominated', 'Best', 'Foreign', 'Film', 'Academy', 'Award', 'one', 'epic', 'bloodbaths', 'find', 'pure', 'escapism', 'especially', 'hot', 'summer', 'day', 'wide', 'screen', 'Directed', 'Russian', 'director', 'Sergei', 'Bodrav', 'was', 'co-produced', 'companies', 'Kazakhstan', 'Mongolia', 'first', 'part', 'planned', 'three-part', 'series.Mongol', 'early', 'years', 'famed', 'Genghis', 'Khan', 'lifetime', '1162', '1227', 'Mongol', 'Empire', 'eventually', 'occupied', 'most', 'Asia', 'Later', 'descendants', 'went', 'stretch', 'Mongol', 'Empire', 'most', 'Eurasia', 'including', 'modern', 'China', 'as', 'well', 'substantial', 'portions', 'Russia', 'Southern', 'Asia', 'Eastern', 'Europe', 'Middle', 'East.The', 'story', 'when', 'young', 'Genghis', 'Khan', 'then', 'called', 'Tomudgen', 'was', 'nine', 'years', 'old', 'father', 'small', 'group', 'warriors', 'felt', 'was', 'time', 'find', 'bride', 'traveled', 'neighboring', 'nomadic', 'camp', 'here', 'met', 'ten-year-old', 'Botte', 'spite', 'fact', 'father', 'wanted', 'choose', 'bride', 'different', 'tribe', 'Tomudgen', 'insisted', 'Botte', 'were', 'betrothed', 'plans', 'were', 'made', 'Tomudgen', 'return', 'five', 'years', 'claim', 'her.However', 'way', 'back', 'home', 'father', 'was', 'poisoned', 'enemies', 'young', 'Tomudgen', 'was', 'taken', 'prisoner', 'received', 'harsh', 'treatment', 'escaped', 'however', 'was', 'befriended', 'boy', 'who', 'later', 'grew', 'up', 'first', 'be', 'friend', 'later', 'enemy.The', 'film', 'comprised', 'almost', 'non-stop', 'violence', 'huge', 'cast', 'warriors', 'many', 'battle', 'scenes', 'Blood', 'flows', 'while', 'get', 'boring', 'also', 'fair', 'share', 'torture', 'break', 'monotony', 'Eventually', 'Botte', 'Tomudgen', 'marry', 'captured', 'warlord', 'two', 'years', 'rescue', 'are', 'separated', 'again', 'later', 'time', 'who', 'Most', 'time', 'story', 'held', 'interest', 'would', 'have', 'preferred', 'battle', 'scenes', 'be', 'shorter', 'just', 'so', 'much', 'spurting', 'blood', 'can', 'take.This', 'way', 'great', 'film', 'so', 'much', 'violence', 'soon', 'becomes', 'meaningless', 'are', 'few', 'parts', 'stretch', 'imagination', 'just', 'too', 'much', 'such', 'time', 'young', 'Tomudgen', 'ice', 'middle', 'winter', 'miraculously', 'survives', 'time', 'pack', 'wild', 'dogs', 'years', 'being', 'kept', 'captive', 'slave', 'Certainly', 'not', 'film', 'everyone', 'can', 'only', 'give', 'very', 'mild', 'recommended.However', 'must', 'say', 'am', 'looking', 'forward', 'sequel']",Mongol: The Early Years of Genghis Khan

1110129,AAW58LG72PG7I,B000WLYDNM,"Martin Asiner ""Adjunct College Instructor""","[1, 1]","In MONGOL, director Sergei Bobrov presents more than a movie biography of one of the world's most ruthless conquerors.  MONGOL is the first in a proposed trilogy that will span the life and times of the man history calls Genghis Khan. Many reviewers have commented on what they saw as excessive gore reducing the dramatic thrust purporting to show the slow growth of one man with a Vision to unite all Mongols.  There is plenty of bloodletting and extended battle scenes but such glimpses into history and the Mongol psyche are needed to show how that one man could make the transition from the humblest of slaves to the Great Khan of all Mongols.  MONGOL is a traditional film of the life of a ruler that director Bobrov sees more as George Washington than Adolf Hitler.  The historical Temudgin was one of the most ruthless genocidal despots of all times.  The film hints at the Mongol practice of taking the children of beaten enemies and measuring them against the height of a wagon wheel.  All those that exceeded that height were killed on the spot.  Temudgin continued this practice for his entire reign.  When a city surrendured to him, Temudgin spared it and its inhabitants.  If it resisted, he reduced the buildings to rubble and put the residents to the sword--men, women, children.  That Temudgin is nowhere to be found here.  This Temudgin is a gentler more compassionate soul, who can even find it in his heart to forgive his bloodbrother who enslaved him and took away his family and possessions.  This Temudgin can reward a beaten army by accepting its helpless soldiers into his own forces.MONGOL begins with a ten year old Temudgin, who is told by his father to choose a wife.  This Temudgin does but is told that he must wait five years to claim her.  His father is assassinated while his uncle claims the Khanate.  The boy grows up in solitude.  Eventualy, he reclaims his wife, Borte, only to lose her to kidnappers in the employ of his uncle.  Temudgin is captured and sold into slavery, where Borte aids in his escape.  The film moves forward in gripping scenes, all of which point toward Temudgin as uniting all Mongols under his banner.  He even posits a sort of Mongol Ten Commandments by which he swears before heaven that all Mongols must obey, even if he must slay half of them to convince the other half.  Temudgin comes across as basically a good sort, one whose traits of leadership are so apparent that he has no problem raising an army.  The actors speak in Mongol with English subtitles but simply watching facial and body language usually suffices to maintain viewer interest and knowledge.  The only major flaw is that the film merely presents as a given Temudgin's heavenly inspired traits of leadership.  Still, MONGOL is a major accomplishment that suggests that the gap between history and Hollywood may not be as insurmountable as is often the case.",5,Temudgin as Mongol Patriot,1252022400,"09 4, 2009",2009,2892,"['MONGOL', 'director', 'Sergei', 'Bobrov', 'more', 'movie', 'biography', 'one', 'world', 'most', 'ruthless', 'conquerors', 'MONGOL', 'first', 'proposed', 'trilogy', 'will', 'span', 'life', 'times', 'man', 'history', 'Genghis', 'Khan', 'Many', 'reviewers', 'have', 'commented', 'what', 'saw', 'excessive', 'gore', 'reducing', 'dramatic', 'thrust', 'purporting', 'show', 'slow', 'growth', 'one', 'man', 'Vision', 'unite', 'Mongols', 'plenty', 'bloodletting', 'extended', 'battle', 'scenes', 'such', 'glimpses', 'history', 'Mongol', 'psyche', 'are', 'needed', 'show', 'how', 'one', 'man', 'could', 'make', 'transition', 'humblest', 'slaves', 'Great', 'Khan', 'Mongols', 'MONGOL', 'traditional', 'film', 'life', 'ruler', 'director', 'Bobrov', 'more', 'George', 'Washington', 'Adolf', 'Hitler', 'historical', 'Temudgin', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'ruthless', 'genocidal', 'despots', 'times', 'film', 'hints', 'Mongol', 'practice', 'taking', 'children', 'beaten', 'enemies', 'measuring', 'height', 'wagon', 'wheel', 'exceeded', 'height', 'were', 'killed', 'spot', 'Temudgin', 'continued', 'practice', 'entire', 'reign', 'When', 'city', 'surrendured', 'Temudgin', 'spared', 'inhabitants', 'resisted', 'reduced', 'buildings', 'rubble', 'put', 'residents', 'sword', 'men', 'women', 'children', 'Temudgin', 'nowhere', 'be', 'found', 'here', 'Temudgin', 'gentler', 'more', 'compassionate', 'soul', 'who', 'can', 'even', 'find', 'heart', 'forgive', 'bloodbrother', 'who', 'enslaved', 'took', 'away', 'family', 'possessions', 'Temudgin', 'can', 'reward', 'beaten', 'army', 'accepting', 'helpless', 'soldiers', 'own', 'forces.MONGOL', 'ten', 'year', 'old', 'Temudgin', 'who', 'told', 'father', 'choose', 'wife', 'Temudgin', 'told', 'must', 'wait', 'five', 'years', 'claim', 'father', 'assassinated', 'uncle', 'Khanate', 'boy', 'up', 'solitude', 'Eventualy', 'wife', 'Borte', 'only', 'lose', 'kidnappers', 'employ', 'uncle', 'Temudgin', 'captured', 'sold', 'slavery', 'where', 'Borte', 'aids', 'escape', 'film', 'forward', 'gripping', 'scenes', 'point', 'Temudgin', 'uniting', 'Mongols', 'banner', 'even', 'sort', 'Mongol', 'Ten', 'Commandments', 'heaven', 'Mongols', 'must', 'obey', 'even', 'must', 'slay', 'half', 'convince', 'other', 'half', 'Temudgin', 'basically', 'good', 'sort', 'one', 'traits', 'leadership', 'are', 'so', 'apparent', 'problem', 'raising', 'army', 'actors', 'speak', 'Mongol', 'English', 'subtitles', 'simply', 'watching', 'facial', 'body', 'language', 'usually', 'maintain', 'viewer', 'interest', 'knowledge', 'only', 'major', 'flaw', 'film', 'merely', 'given', 'Temudgin', 'heavenly', 'inspired', 'traits', 'leadership', 'Still', 'MONGOL', 'major', 'accomplishment', 'gap', 'history', 'Hollywood', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'as', 'insurmountable', 'often', 'case']",Mongol: The Early Years of Genghis Khan
1110130,A1DUWRMZVLRKAJ,B000WLYDNM,maskedgamer,"[5, 9]","I go into every movie I watch with an open mind. Some movies you sit down not knowing what to expect and find yourself being amazed. Some movies you sit down and watch knowing what you should expect but only find yourself being disappointed. That is exactly the way I felt about this film.The acting was fine but the story... it just doesn't seem to have been presented properly in this film. There so much they skip over and there's parts that they lengthen that really should have been over and done with in the first part of the film. Instead of a story about Genghis khan a fierce Mongolian leader I get a story about a man and his love for his wife and that's really all this movie really is.Genghis and his wife get separated some events happen and they unite again they get separated again some events happen they get united again end movie. The entire length of the film Genghis is either locked up or running away. The only impression that you get is that he is weak and a coward and can't get anything done without someone helping him. Does that depict the picture of one of histories greatest warlords?Watching this film you get no sense of what made Genghis decide to unite Mongolians or take on rivaling nations. Most documentaries try to create a story that at least give you an idea of what makes the mind of a great man tick...this movie doesn't. I was more or less curious why he chose to stay with such a promiscuous wife who had children that were fathered by other men at the time she was married to Genghis. Why didn't she fight back? If she was raped she never showed it. The only idea the movie gives you in regards to her promiscuity is that she doesn't know how to keep her legs closed...and Genghis is a man who is head over heels in love with a woman that he barely knows (but other men know her very well).It may sound like I'm pulling away from the movie but that is what this film is mostly about. The story of Ghengis's childhood, and his rise to power only seem like a minor subplot. It felt like everything that the movie should be showing you they skipped over and  replaced with a title screen explaining a date and what happened and then going back into the mundane story.The highlights of the film are when Genghis clashes against another Khan whom he befriended once. This is what scored big on the movie with me as this story line is great... But there's too little of it. Things like this should be what the movie is about... not 20 minutes total of it.I rated this movie 2 stars because honestly the 2 hours I spent watching this should have been condensed down to half an hour. The story about a leader and his wife might be great for a movie about Mary Antoinette. But this is a movie about Genghis Khan. His wife didn't unite Mongolia he did and that's what this movie should be focusing on. What horrors did Genghis see and experience that made him want to unite his people so much. What made him want to wage war against other nations?  That is what this movie should had been about.Take the 10 Commandments for example. You see Moses care free, then you see Moses realize the cruelty around him, then you watch him change, then you watch him want to do something about it, then you watch him find a way to do something about it, then you see him return with his solution, then you see him put this to action,then you see why the people choose to follow him, and how he became such a great leader. It's that simple!After watching this film I know nothing more about Genghis Khan than I did before it. The only impression I have of him now is that his wife wasn't very faithful.The reason I give this movie 2 stars is because you don't turn a movie that should be about a Warlord into a love story. This movie could have and should have been done better. I don't know what the director was going for... but this... this isn't acceptable.  I only hope that one day someone can make the Genghis Khan movie that deserves to be watched.Overall- Interesting movie, good actors, nice story...but applied to the wrong Historical figure!",2,A bland film that could have been done much better.,1282780800,"08 26, 2010",2010,4074,"['go', 'movie', 'watch', 'open', 'mind', 'movies', 'sit', 'down', 'not', 'knowing', 'what', 'expect', 'find', 'being', 'amazed', 'movies', 'sit', 'down', 'watch', 'knowing', 'what', 'should', 'expect', 'only', 'find', 'being', 'disappointed', 'exactly', 'way', 'felt', 'film.The', 'acting', 'was', 'fine', 'story', 'just', ""n't"", 'seem', 'have', 'been', 'presented', 'properly', 'film', 'so', 'much', 'skip', 'parts', 'lengthen', 'really', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'first', 'part', 'film', 'Instead', 'story', 'Genghis', 'khan', 'fierce', 'Mongolian', 'leader', 'get', 'story', 'man', 'love', 'wife', 'really', 'movie', 'really', 'is.Genghis', 'wife', 'get', 'separated', 'events', 'happen', 'unite', 'again', 'get', 'separated', 'again', 'events', 'happen', 'get', 'united', 'again', 'end', 'movie', 'entire', 'length', 'film', 'Genghis', 'either', 'locked', 'up', 'running', 'away', 'only', 'impression', 'get', 'weak', 'coward', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'anything', 'done', 'someone', 'helping', 'depict', 'picture', 'one', 'histories', 'greatest', 'warlords', 'Watching', 'film', 'get', 'sense', 'what', 'made', 'Genghis', 'decide', 'unite', 'Mongolians', 'take', 'rivaling', 'nations', 'Most', 'documentaries', 'try', 'create', 'story', 'least', 'give', 'idea', 'what', 'mind', 'great', 'man', 'tick', 'movie', ""n't"", 'was', 'more', 'less', 'curious', 'why', 'chose', 'stay', 'promiscuous', 'wife', 'who', 'had', 'children', 'were', 'fathered', 'other', 'men', 'time', 'was', 'married', 'Genghis', 'Why', 'did', ""n't"", 'fight', 'back', 'was', 'raped', 'never', 'showed', 'only', 'idea', 'movie', 'regards', 'promiscuity', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'keep', 'legs', 'closed', 'Genghis', 'man', 'who', 'head', 'heels', 'love', 'woman', 'barely', 'other', 'men', 'know', 'very', 'well', '.It', 'may', 'sound', ""'m"", 'pulling', 'away', 'movie', 'what', 'film', 'mostly', 'about', 'story', 'Ghengis', 'childhood', 'rise', 'power', 'only', 'seem', 'minor', 'subplot', 'felt', 'everything', 'movie', 'should', 'be', 'showing', 'skipped', 'replaced', 'title', 'screen', 'explaining', 'date', 'what', 'happened', 'then', 'going', 'back', 'mundane', 'story.The', 'highlights', 'film', 'are', 'when', 'Genghis', 'Khan', 'whom', 'befriended', 'once', 'what', 'scored', 'big', 'movie', 'story', 'line', 'great', 'too', 'little', 'Things', 'should', 'be', 'what', 'movie', 'not', '20', 'minutes', 'total', 'it.I', 'rated', 'movie', '2', 'stars', 'because', 'honestly', '2', 'hours', 'spent', 'watching', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'condensed', 'down', 'hour', 'story', 'leader', 'wife', 'might', 'be', 'great', 'movie', 'Mary', 'Antoinette', 'movie', 'Genghis', 'Khan', 'wife', 'did', ""n't"", 'unite', 'Mongolia', 'did', 'what', 'movie', 'should', 'be', 'focusing', 'What', 'horrors', 'did', 'Genghis', 'see', 'experience', 'made', 'want', 'unite', 'people', 'so', 'much', 'What', 'made', 'want', 'wage', 'war', 'other', 'nations', 'what', 'movie', 'should', 'had', 'been', 'about.Take', '10', 'Commandments', 'example', 'see', 'Moses', 'care', 'free', 'then', 'see', 'Moses', 'realize', 'cruelty', 'then', 'watch', 'change', 'then', 'watch', 'want', 'do', 'something', 'then', 'watch', 'find', 'way', 'do', 'something', 'then', 'see', 'return', 'solution', 'then', 'see', 'put', 'action', 'then', 'see', 'why', 'people', 'choose', 'follow', 'how', 'became', 'such', 'great', 'leader', 'simple', 'watching', 'film', 'know', 'nothing', 'more', 'Genghis', 'Khan', 'did', 'only', 'impression', 'have', 'now', 'wife', 'was', ""n't"", 'very', 'faithful.The', 'reason', 'give', 'movie', '2', 'stars', 'do', ""n't"", 'turn', 'movie', 'should', 'be', 'Warlord', 'love', 'story', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'better', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'director', 'was', 'going', ""n't"", 'acceptable', 'only', 'hope', 'one', 'day', 'someone', 'can', 'make', 'Genghis', 'Khan', 'movie', 'be', 'watched.Overall-', 'Interesting', 'movie', 'good', 'actors', 'nice', 'story', 'applied', 'wrong', 'Historical', 'figure']",Mongol: The Early Years of Genghis Khan

However the main part of this movie to me is the love story between Gengis and borte.  He goes through alot and is the best of men toward her, he raises the children she has after she is raped and must sleep with other men to help free him.That's a great story in any culture. I hope that much of the khans life is true because the rest is one of the most bloody and terrible in history. Khan is still in the top five mass killers in history! Chairman Mao is number one but he had a modern machinery of death at his disposal. (stalin, hitler, lenin, fill out the top five with khan) Mao undoubtably looked up to Khan to.  This blu ray looks gorgeous and the story is engaging. If Gengis career had ended with him unifying his savage people (this story is matched in all civilizations and races  as warlike tribal people come under a more central authority) then he'd be remembered by the world as a great leader only and not a cruel mass slaughterer of whole civilizations. alexander the great also had bad moments too though.  but in history Khan was  The worst since attila the hun in fact.  However unlike the Huns who left only ruins his decendants were the cupholders of civilization and unification. And khan didn't destroy unless you resisted him, the huns did it for plunder only with no idea of creating a empire. That places khan as more than just a mass exterminator like attila.This movie is fast paced enough but like all movies you most wonder how much of this happened beyond the basic facts but who cares when you get a decent story like this.  The movie is subtitled and the print looks fine. It's a good flick and blu ray is only way  to go.

1110136,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B000WLYDNM,mirasreviews,"[2, 2]","""Mongol"" is a sweeping epic of the life of Mongolian conqueror Genghis Khan, intended as the first installment in a trilogy. This first chapter brings us the legendary childhood and youth of the great military leader, up to the point when he unites Mongolia under one rule. A spare voiceover narration takes us back to the fateful day when 9-year-old Temudjin (Odnyam Odsurem) chose his young bride and lost his father, Khan Esugei (Ba Sen). Temudjin (Asano Tadanobu) then spends nearly 20 years as a fugitive from his father's successor Targutai (Amadu Mamadakov) and his clan's traditional enemies, the Merkits. Enslaved repeatedly and always intent on reuniting with his wife Borte (Khulan Chuluun), Temudjin dreams of a more peaceful and unified Mongolia. When he finally gains his freedom it is only his equally ambitious ""blood brother"" Jamukha (Honglei Sun) who stands in his way.The earliest source of information about Genghis Khan's youth is a poem entitled ""A Secret History of the Mongols"" that was written after his death. It may be fanciful, and there is a 10-year gap in information, in any case. But ""Mongol""'s Russian director and co-writer Sergei Bodrov has used the poem as inspiration to construct his tale of Genghis Khan's origins. Temudjin is also presented in such a way as to appeal to more modern values: a man who believes in the greatness of his country, but also generosity to his warriors, loyalty to family, and rule of law. Bodrov doesn't attempt to disguise the legendary nature of his subject. He presents Temudjin as enjoying the favor of his pan-god Tengri and coming to power through destiny as much as through perseverance.This is an action movie with bloody battles as well as a quasi-mythic biography, and I found the CGI heavy-handed in the final battle. But ""Mongol"" is a Hollywood-style epic amazingly made for only $20 million. Filmed amid stunning landscapes in remote Mongolia, China, and Kazakhstan, it and looks like it cost three times that. This is a majestic recreation of Genghis Khan's rise to power, but it's not entirely lacking in humor. Borte is a shrewd and loyal wife who ironically tends to bear children by other men, much to the audience's amusement, if not Temudjin's. Sergei Bodrov embraces the recent trend to cast actors who must learn their lines phonetically. Asano Tadanobu is Japanese, and Honglei Sun is Chinese. Both men have an imposing presence, but the film is in Mongolian with optional English, English SDH, and Spanish subtitles.

It didn't play anywhere near where I live, so I was more than happy to see that it became available to rent this week.First off, the good stuff. The filming locations are spectacular and the lead performance by Tadanobu Asano as Genghis Khan was very well done. I also thought the music fit this flick like a glove.Now the not so good stuff. I know this is suppose to be part one of a trilogy, but they barely scratched the surface here. I did a huge paper in college on Genghis Khan and the Mongol Empire and when this film ended I was left wanting so much more. They better finish his life story in the future or this will be a wasted piece of cinema. The movie also flows at a weird pace and seems longer than two hours. The battle scenes were okay, but they didn't have the epic quality of say Braveheart or Kingdom of Heaven.I really wanted to love the movie, but it left me cold most of the time. It's still worth a rental if you like partial history and entertainment mashed together. Just don't expect the masterpiece this film could have been.

1110142,A3R1WFO4KIUQXZ,B000WLYDNM,PhotoGraphics,"[0, 0]","This is a movie on the scale of what Hollywood was once capable of. It isn't and doesn't have to be historically perfect in every detail of accuracy. There are so many movies based loosely on historical legend that succeed in weaving history with story-telling why single this one out as not being ""historically accurate"". Will the first person who saw the movie who actually witnessed life in the 12th century please step forward and tell us all exactly what went on every day in the life of Genghis Khan? Yet some reviews lean toward criticizing the film's accuracy based on other movies they have seen or books they have read. Bottom line ... this is a movie, not a history book.I am no more qualified than anyone to  discuss how accurately this movie portrays the life story of Genghis Khan, though as a descendent of Mongols and having traveled extensively in the footsteps of Tem&uuml;jin by way of foot, camel and jeep I can say that much of what I saw such as the sharing of milk, the blessing over it, the drunken parties, the relationships of the Mongolians with their families and with each other, and the background scenery of much of this movie is dead-on accurate. I've been there ... the movie, in a sometimes idealized way, often shows us exactly what Tem&uuml;jin himself saw 900 years ago.Taken as a movie, not a history book, the cinematography is excellent. The music is eerily accurate as a popularized version of exactly what camel herders and local entertainers performed for me and have performed for others for centuries. The costumes were romanticized, of course, in most cases. There were times it was hard to focus that we are talking about the 12th century and the movie's costuming simply jumped all over time and space.I am extremely happy that the dialogue of the Mongolian actors was in their native dialect (while the Chinese actors spoke Mandarin and some of the other characters spoke in a Turkic dialect). With my limited knowledge of the Mongolian language I recognized what the people I lived with in Mongolia spoke to me. The sub-titles were well done. To dub the dialogue into the local language of the movie's viewer would have utterly destroyed the movie.I'm not sure what I expected from this movie before seeing it, maybe a preachy documentary or something featuring Tom Cruise and Kim Kardashian in the lead roles to sell at the box office, unfortunately if Hollywood made this movie that may actually have been the case. It was easy to ease into the more casual and less hammy acting of the actors who were chosen. There were no miscasts, although Honglei Sun as Jamukha might be just a little over the top with his backaches and neckaches.Watch the movie with an open and relaxed mind and tune in on the many subtleties used to help us understand the conditions and circumstances that formed one of the most memorable people in all of history. Take time to dissect the battle scenes to see how Tem&uuml;jin progressed from being the underdog to becoming Genghis Khan, perhaps the most brilliant military strategians of all time. And do read the subtitles, there aren't that many of them.I highly recommend this movie.",5,Detailed review of a superb movie,1404345600,"07 3, 2014",2014,3165,"['movie', 'scale', 'what', 'Hollywood', 'was', 'once', 'capable', ""n't"", ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'historically', 'perfect', 'detail', 'accuracy', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'movies', 'based', 'loosely', 'historical', 'legend', 'succeed', 'weaving', 'history', 'story-telling', 'why', 'single', 'one', 'out', 'not', 'being', 'historically', 'accurate', 'Will', 'first', 'person', 'who', 'saw', 'movie', 'who', 'actually', 'witnessed', 'life', '12th', 'century', 'please', 'step', 'forward', 'tell', 'exactly', 'what', 'went', 'day', 'life', 'Genghis', 'Khan', 'reviews', 'lean', 'criticizing', 'film', 'accuracy', 'based', 'other', 'movies', 'have', 'seen', 'books', 'have', 'read', 'Bottom', 'line', 'movie', 'not', 'history', 'book.I', 'am', 'more', 'qualified', 'anyone', 'discuss', 'how', 'accurately', 'movie', 'life', 'story', 'Genghis', 'Khan', 'though', 'descendent', 'Mongols', 'having', 'traveled', 'extensively', 'footsteps', 'Tem', 'uuml', 'jin', 'way', 'foot', 'camel', 'jeep', 'can', 'say', 'much', 'what', 'saw', 'such', 'sharing', 'milk', 'blessing', 'drunken', 'parties', 'relationships', 'Mongolians', 'families', 'other', 'background', 'scenery', 'much', 'movie', 'dead-on', 'accurate', ""'ve"", 'been', 'movie', 'sometimes', 'idealized', 'way', 'often', 'exactly', 'what', 'Tem', 'uuml', 'saw', '900', 'years', 'ago.Taken', 'movie', 'not', 'history', 'book', 'cinematography', 'excellent', 'music', 'eerily', 'accurate', 'popularized', 'version', 'exactly', 'what', 'camel', 'herders', 'local', 'entertainers', 'performed', 'have', 'performed', 'others', 'centuries', 'costumes', 'were', 'romanticized', 'course', 'most', 'cases', 'were', 'times', 'was', 'hard', 'focus', 'are', 'talking', '12th', 'century', 'movie', 'costuming', 'simply', 'jumped', 'time', 'space.I', 'am', 'extremely', 'happy', 'dialogue', 'Mongolian', 'actors', 'was', 'native', 'dialect', 'Chinese', 'actors', 'spoke', 'Mandarin', 'other', 'characters', 'spoke', 'Turkic', 'dialect', 'limited', 'knowledge', 'Mongolian', 'language', 'recognized', 'what', 'people', 'lived', 'Mongolia', 'spoke', 'sub-titles', 'were', 'well', 'done', 'dub', 'dialogue', 'local', 'language', 'movie', 'viewer', 'would', 'have', 'utterly', 'destroyed', 'movie.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'expected', 'movie', 'seeing', 'maybe', 'preachy', 'documentary', 'something', 'featuring', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'Kim', 'Kardashian', 'lead', 'sell', 'box', 'office', 'unfortunately', 'Hollywood', 'made', 'movie', 'may', 'actually', 'have', 'been', 'case', 'was', 'easy', 'ease', 'more', 'casual', 'less', 'hammy', 'acting', 'actors', 'who', 'were', 'chosen', 'were', 'miscasts', 'Honglei', 'Sun', 'Jamukha', 'might', 'be', 'just', 'little', 'top', 'backaches', 'neckaches.Watch', 'movie', 'open', 'relaxed', 'mind', 'tune', 'many', 'subtleties', 'used', 'help', 'understand', 'conditions', 'circumstances', 'formed', 'one', 'most', 'memorable', 'people', 'history', 'Take', 'time', 'dissect', 'battle', 'scenes', 'see', 'how', 'Tem', 'uuml', 'jin', 'progressed', 'being', 'underdog', 'becoming', 'Genghis', 'Khan', 'perhaps', 'most', 'brilliant', 'military', 'strategians', 'time', 'do', 'read', 'subtitles', 'are', ""n't"", 'many', 'them.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'movie']",Mongol: The Early Years of Genghis Khan

Ryan ""The Ryan Identity""","[0, 0]","Although this compelling film is about the life of the infamous Ghengis Khan, he was not given that name until after the time period covered here. His birth name was Temudjin, and the film follows him from a nine year old boy, until approximately his early thirties when he unites the numerous Mongol tribes under his banner. As one would expect, life on the Mongolian steppe in the 12th century is harsh; constant tribal warfare, being kidnapped and sold into slavery, having your bride stolen by a rival tribe, seeing your father poisoned to death; this is the environment that molded the young Temudjin into a hardened killer. The film is very violent, but it is also beautiful in its own way. Even in such a harsh atmosphere, there is room for love, loyalty, brotherhood, and honor. I can't speak for the historical accuracy, but the film does seem to paint a relatively benign picture of Temudjin, his betrayal of his blood brother Jamukha notwithstanding. Considering that the guy was essentially a mass murderer, I can definitely see how some would call this a whitewash. From a technical perspective, the film is nearly flawless; breathtaking cinematography, great acting, amazing score, fight choreography, costumes, etc. The film is put together very well.

1110146,AFJFXN42RZ3G2,B000WLYDNM,"R. DelParto ""Rose2""","[2, 3]","MONGOL:  CHINGISHAN is an epic film.  Director Sergei Bodrov captures the first installment of a trilogy of the life of one of history's most larger than life figures, the early life of Mongolian ruler Genghis Khan from 1186-1206.  From the age of ten years old up to his rise as Khan ruler, viewers will see Genghis Khan's perilous journey that involved friends and foes, but one that also centered on the god, Tengri, from whom he soughtt continuous guidance.Bodrov portrays the human side of Temudgin (Asano Tadanobu), the name he was born with.  First, as a boy choosing his young wife, Borte (Bayetsetserg Erdenbat), and later as a ruler and family man of two children, who has countless misses with his wife (Khulan Chuluun) where he loses and regains her through unusual circumstances; also, there is the blood brother relationship between he and Jamukha (Honglei Sun), who is the warrior-like character in the film who adds a little humor in between war scenes; it is a relationship that is both brotherly and friendly despite the debacles that occur.Indeed, the cinematography and the soundtrack make the film.  The spacious mountainous and grassy landscapes, which was shot in China and Kazakhstan is absolutely beautiful and captures the essence of the film.  MONGOL surpasses all other versions of films that have depicted the life of Genghis Khan; this version has a foreign film quality with subtitles and is superbly done.  Bodrov shows the warrior-tribal and nomadic aspect of the Mongolian people.  The film has an old Hollywood western-like quality similar to the Cowboys chasing the Indians, bow and arrows being shot, and tee-pee-like settlements are displayed; one can say that this film was made the old way without the pyrotechnics, digital effects, and chanting and thumping soundtracks that have coveted most epic films in recent times a la LORD OF THE RINGS.Overall, MONGOL may interest the history buff or foreign film aficionado.  But be forewarned, the film shows a tremendous amount of graphic and brutal violence.

This is supposed to be the first of a trilogy, and I look forward to subsequent films. The early life of the great Temudgin is slow and precise; the performance of Tadanobu Asano is understated at best, to show a man of simple compassion. Excellent performances from Khulan Chuluun (Borte, his wife) and Sun Honglei as Jamukha (his blood brother) add to the narrative at large. Without blabbing away more (as other reviewers), this is a part of history that can only be told from tales, adding a bit of supernatural to the proceedings (the lore of Tengri). Editing & costumes are great, and the exquisite cinematography captures so much of the landscapes, the land that Temudgen so much wanted to unite. It was actually filmed in Mongolia, and I was impressed. The landscape was as powerful as the story being told, a character unto itself. The DVD I watched had no extras, which disappointed me a lot.

1110150,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B000WLYDNM,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[0, 0]","Mongol (Sergei Bodrov, 2007)Despite the fact that Tadanobu Asano is a superstar across the Pacific, I never thought I'd get the chance to see an Asano movie on the big screen here in America. So before I do anything else, I have to thank-- profusely-- Picturehouse, Mongol's American distributor, and say that I hope against hope that this is the beginning of a beautiful partnership. America needs more Asano on the big screen. I am even happier to say that, while this isn't Asano's best work, the movie itself is quite strong, and there are a lot of other actors who turn in performances almost as, or just as, good as Asano's to make this into a quite enjoyable moviegoing experience.Asano plays Temudjin (as an adult), the man who became Genghis Khan. The movie opens with us seeing Asano's face, crusted with grime, staring out through the bars of a cage. What in the world...?, you may ask. I mean, this is the guy who conquered the entire known world, right? Well, it does eventually make sense. Much of the movie is told in flashback, and much of it centers around Temudjin's relationship with his wife Borte (Khulan Chuluun), whom he first meets at the age of nine, and who sticks with him from that point despite that fact that, well, he's not really around much, since he's off conquering and warring and all that stuff. And yes, there's a good deal of that to be found here, despite that fact that this deals with the years before Temudjin became Genghis Khan; before he united them, the Mongols liked to fight amongst themselves a great deal, and Temudjin himself was often the spoils over which the wars were being fought. (Explaining why would take too long; trust me, he spends a lot of time as a prisoner for a while there.) Eventually, he makes friends with another young chap named Jamukha (played as an adult by Honglei Sun), and the two of them together start the long, tedious grind of fight, assimilate, fight, assimilate--  except that something goes horribly wrong. And now we're well into spoiler territory, so I'll stop there.Make no mistake, Mongol is an action movie, but in saying that, I should also say that structurally, it reminds me more of epic westerns than it does conventional action pictures-- movies like The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly or Tombstone where there are relatively few moments of action punctuating a tale that's more intrigue than blood flow. Movies like this have a propensity to fall on their faces if the intrigue isn't properly paced. Mongol, which was nominated for the Best Foreign Film Academy Award (losing to Stefan Ruzowitzky-- no shame there) and which swept six Nika Awards (Russia's version of the Oscars), every category in which it was nominated, is pretty obviously one of those movies that doesn't fall on its face in this regard. Bodrov (Nomad) has quite a head for this sort of thing, it would seem.It should also be noted that some of the history is fudged, and a great deal is oversimplified, but you have to expect that. It is a movie, after all.Even if you're not an obsessive Tadanobu Asano fan, I strongly suggest catching this one on the big screen while you still have the time; it's the kind of cast-of-thousands epic that can't help but lose something in translation.

Crawford,"[1, 1]","Having just read a bio of Genghis Khan and the Empire his sons expanded and then squandered by in-fighting, I found this film utterly riveting and reasonably accurate historically.  The acting is also superb, with an entirely non-caucasian cast, in the Mongol language rather than dubbed.  It is a kind of character study of a political and military genius, with the personal choices he makes that reinforce his leadership, in particular the tough wife, Borte.The film version shoehorns his life into a coherent narrative.  Born into a small unit of families, of which his father was a leader, Genghis (then ""Temeugen"") was comfortable and learned the ways of the Steppe.  This was a time of warring petty tribes that stole brides and pillaged the goods of others via constant attacks.  They had some customs, but not many.  Everything changed when his father was poisoned:  his family was ruined by a turncoat, he was enslaved after becoming a blood brother with a leader who would become his rival, and he rose to lead his own band.  Eventually, after many reversals and horrible ordeals, coupled to his military prowess, he creates a series of laws that enable him to become the Khan of all Mongols, eliminating all enemies and ending the incessant warfare, in the process creating one of the greatest fighting forces of all time.This is a simplified version that is fairly accurate.  He was enslaved as a child, did find a great life partner in his wife, and was an inspired leader of men.  But the ""narrative"" sets up a bunch of set pieces that over-simplify things or add details that can never be known.  While he did have a blood brother he later unseated because only one of them could be leader, he did not seek personal vengeance against the many stereotypical enemies or rival kingdoms that the film highlights.  His wife also did not rescue him from a second captivity.  Nor did he preserve those who were decent to him during the many periods of struggle as a slave.  But that is the stuff of good fiction, an indulgence I can accept.The film does romanticize him a bit too much, which is my only criticism.  The actor makes him extremely sympathetic:  you understand what he suffered and rejoice in the justice he created in his system of laws.  What you don't see is that his army continued to pillage and inflict suffering on its enemies with a brutality that was organized into larger military units.  Essentially, he turned the energies of the small tribes outward, with the same ruthless methods.I would recommend this film as a wonderful evocation of history, but would suggest that viewers look beyond the narrative.",4,excellent evocation of a leader of genius,1288310400,"10 29, 2010",2010,2638,"['Having', 'just', 'read', 'bio', 'Genghis', 'Khan', 'Empire', 'sons', 'expanded', 'then', 'squandered', 'in-fighting', 'found', 'film', 'utterly', 'riveting', 'reasonably', 'accurate', 'historically', 'acting', 'also', 'superb', 'entirely', 'non-caucasian', 'cast', 'Mongol', 'language', 'rather', 'dubbed', 'kind', 'character', 'study', 'political', 'military', 'genius', 'personal', 'choices', 'reinforce', 'leadership', 'particular', 'tough', 'wife', 'Borte.The', 'film', 'version', 'life', 'coherent', 'narrative', 'Born', 'small', 'unit', 'families', 'father', 'was', 'leader', 'Genghis', 'then', 'Temeugen', 'was', 'comfortable', 'learned', 'ways', 'Steppe', 'was', 'time', 'warring', 'petty', 'tribes', 'stole', 'brides', 'pillaged', 'goods', 'others', 'constant', 'attacks', 'had', 'customs', 'not', 'many', 'Everything', 'changed', 'when', 'father', 'was', 'poisoned', 'family', 'was', 'ruined', 'turncoat', 'was', 'enslaved', 'becoming', 'blood', 'brother', 'leader', 'who', 'would', 'become', 'rival', 'rose', 'lead', 'own', 'band', 'Eventually', 'many', 'reversals', 'horrible', 'ordeals', 'coupled', 'military', 'prowess', 'series', 'laws', 'enable', 'become', 'Khan', 'Mongols', 'eliminating', 'enemies', 'ending', 'incessant', 'warfare', 'process', 'creating', 'one', 'greatest', 'fighting', 'forces', 'time.This', 'simplified', 'version', 'fairly', 'accurate', 'was', 'enslaved', 'child', 'did', 'find', 'great', 'life', 'partner', 'wife', 'was', 'inspired', 'leader', 'men', 'narrative', 'up', 'bunch', 'set', 'pieces', 'over-simplify', 'things', 'add', 'details', 'can', 'never', 'be', 'known', 'did', 'have', 'blood', 'brother', 'later', 'unseated', 'only', 'one', 'could', 'be', 'leader', 'did', 'not', 'seek', 'personal', 'vengeance', 'many', 'stereotypical', 'enemies', 'rival', 'kingdoms', 'film', 'highlights', 'wife', 'also', 'did', 'not', 'rescue', 'second', 'captivity', 'did', 'preserve', 'who', 'were', 'decent', 'many', 'periods', 'struggle', 'slave', 'stuff', 'good', 'fiction', 'indulgence', 'can', 'accept.The', 'film', 'romanticize', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'only', 'criticism', 'actor', 'extremely', 'sympathetic', 'understand', 'what', 'suffered', 'rejoice', 'justice', 'created', 'system', 'laws', 'What', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'army', 'continued', 'pillage', 'inflict', 'suffering', 'enemies', 'brutality', 'was', 'organized', 'larger', 'military', 'units', 'Essentially', 'turned', 'energies', 'small', 'tribes', 'outward', 'same', 'ruthless', 'methods.I', 'would', 'recommend', 'film', 'wonderful', 'evocation', 'history', 'would', 'suggest', 'viewers', 'look', 'narrative']",Mongol: The Early Years of Genghis Khan

Tsujimura,"[3, 3]","I viewed this movie in the theaters and was totally impressed, so impressed I was moved to seek out another movie about Genghis Khan produced for the Japanese market, ""Genghis Khan to the Ends of the Earth"", and the book, "" Genghis Khan and the Making of the Modern World.""  Based upon the latter, the Japanese produced DVD seems more accurate, as the story lines in both while similar diverge at times.  The Japanese production is focused on Genghis Khan's [more appropriately Temujin, his name before he became Khan] mother and her voice narrates, whereas this DVD focuses on Temujin's relationship with his wife Boorte.  The defining difference is that this movie is in Mongol where the Japanese is in Japanese.

As epic as the film feels though, it leaves you with the desire for more - both in the jumps in the Khan's ascent to ruler and in his reshaping of a kingdom once such power is attained.While many have heard of the historic conquests of Genghis Khan, few probably know the story of his rise to power. In fact, no one probably knows the real story, as historical records of his early life are scarce and often conflicting. But here a grand tale is told, with enough embellishments and creative liberties to portray an honorable leader and the events that shaped his eventual quest to unite a people. Whether any of it is true or not, the hardships, betrayals, vengeance, and warring that Mongol inflicts upon Temudjin makes for entertaining storytelling. The culture and customs of the Mongolian people remain genuine, and such traditions and presentation create the authenticity required to believe in the noble leader and his perilous undertaking.Though marketed primarily as an action epic, Mongol focuses heavily on the love story that envelopes much of Temudjin's young adulthood and the tumultuous relationships with other Khans that lead to many of the major conflicts he faces. Continually separated from each other, Temudjin and his wife Borte must alternatingly rescue each other from dire situations, and the film suggests that his wife's strong character played an important role in the Khan's decisions. Temudjin's mission to rescue Borte brings him in contact with Jamukha and through ensuing misunderstandings and backstabbing tactics they eventually become bitter enemies. Though their warring again leaves him apart from Borte, their love transcends anything that might distance them. Revenge and betrayal also play heavily into Temudjin's tortured childhood and his numerous enemies constantly seek to destroy all that he has accomplished.While bloody warfare and intense battles are certainly a highlight, the film's strongest feature lies in exceptional acting by a diverse group of talent. Tadanobu Asano gives a solemn, commanding performance as the Khan plagued by ever more harrowing obstacles and creates a heroic character both intriguing and compelling. His unfaltering wife Borte is played with compassion and power by the understated Khulan Chuluun, and the scene-stealing Honglei Sun provides a villain with intelligence, malevolence, and bouts of crazed lunacy.Reminiscent of the progression of Kingdom of Heaven, Mongol depicts the wondrous events that lead up to an even more monumental feat, and we're left with only our preconceived notions and a brief written epilogue that informs us that this is only the beginning. The early life of Genghis Khan that Bodrov has envisioned is fascinating enough that we want to see what happens next, and we might as rumors of a trilogy surface, but for now an epic beginning will have to suffice.- The Massie Twins",4,Mongol Movie Review,1207440000,"04 6, 2008",2008,3072,"['intricate', 'examination', 'life', 'Temudjin', 'journey', 'becoming', 'Genghis', 'Khan', 'Sergei', 'Bodrov', 'Mongol', 'awes', 'gorgeous', 'imagery', 'visceral', 'battles', 'powerful', 'storytelling', 'As', 'epic', 'film', 'feels', 'desire', 'more', 'jumps', 'Khan', 'ascent', 'ruler', 'reshaping', 'kingdom', 'once', 'such', 'power', 'attained.While', 'many', 'have', 'heard', 'historic', 'conquests', 'Genghis', 'Khan', 'few', 'probably', 'know', 'story', 'rise', 'power', 'fact', 'one', 'probably', 'real', 'story', 'historical', 'records', 'early', 'life', 'are', 'scarce', 'often', 'conflicting', 'here', 'grand', 'tale', 'told', 'enough', 'embellishments', 'creative', 'liberties', 'portray', 'honorable', 'leader', 'events', 'shaped', 'eventual', 'quest', 'unite', 'people', 'Whether', 'true', 'not', 'hardships', 'betrayals', 'vengeance', 'warring', 'Mongol', 'Temudjin', 'entertaining', 'storytelling', 'culture', 'customs', 'Mongolian', 'people', 'remain', 'genuine', 'such', 'traditions', 'presentation', 'create', 'authenticity', 'required', 'believe', 'noble', 'leader', 'perilous', 'undertaking.Though', 'marketed', 'primarily', 'action', 'epic', 'Mongol', 'heavily', 'love', 'story', 'much', 'Temudjin', 'young', 'adulthood', 'tumultuous', 'relationships', 'other', 'Khans', 'lead', 'many', 'major', 'conflicts', 'Continually', 'separated', 'other', 'Temudjin', 'wife', 'Borte', 'must', 'alternatingly', 'rescue', 'other', 'dire', 'situations', 'film', 'wife', 'strong', 'character', 'played', 'important', 'role', 'Khan', 'decisions', 'Temudjin', 'mission', 'rescue', 'Borte', 'contact', 'Jamukha', 'ensuing', 'misunderstandings', 'backstabbing', 'tactics', 'eventually', 'become', 'bitter', 'enemies', 'warring', 'again', 'apart', 'Borte', 'love', 'anything', 'might', 'distance', 'Revenge', 'betrayal', 'also', 'play', 'heavily', 'Temudjin', 'tortured', 'childhood', 'numerous', 'enemies', 'constantly', 'seek', 'destroy', 'accomplished.While', 'bloody', 'warfare', 'intense', 'battles', 'are', 'certainly', 'highlight', 'film', 'strongest', 'feature', 'exceptional', 'acting', 'diverse', 'group', 'talent', 'Tadanobu', 'Asano', 'solemn', 'commanding', 'performance', 'Khan', 'plagued', 'ever', 'more', 'harrowing', 'obstacles', 'heroic', 'character', 'intriguing', 'compelling', 'unfaltering', 'wife', 'Borte', 'played', 'compassion', 'power', 'understated', 'Khulan', 'Chuluun', 'scene-stealing', 'Honglei', 'Sun', 'villain', 'intelligence', 'malevolence', 'bouts', 'crazed', 'lunacy.Reminiscent', 'progression', 'Kingdom', 'Heaven', 'Mongol', 'wondrous', 'events', 'lead', 'up', 'even', 'more', 'monumental', 'feat', ""'re"", 'left', 'only', 'preconceived', 'notions', 'brief', 'written', 'epilogue', 'only', 'beginning', 'early', 'life', 'Genghis', 'Khan', 'Bodrov', 'envisioned', 'fascinating', 'enough', 'want', 'see', 'what', 'next', 'might', 'rumors', 'trilogy', 'surface', 'now', 'epic', 'beginning', 'will', 'have', 'suffice.-', 'Massie', 'Twins']",Mongol: The Early Years of Genghis Khan

But this is no Hollywood biopic (qv, ""The Conqueror""). Both the acting and direction are understated, and there are only a few Scenes Of Great Portent. Some questions are left unanswered -- such as how the wolf releases Temudgin's slave shackles and how he repeatedly escapes from his captors. But the story of Ghengis Khan is as much legend as fact, so it's not /that/ important. The film ends as Temudgin is made khan of all the Mongols, leaving room for a sequel. (""The Wrath of Khan""?)The cinematography is outstanding, with lots of wide shots of magnificent landscapes, dotted with tiny human figures.

1110164,A2UUP58XPQW3GF,B000WLYDNM,"Woopak ""The THRILL""","[8, 11]","There has been many attempts to bring the life of Genghis Khan to the big screen. MONGOL (2007) is another attempt by director Sergei Bodrow, and has earned itself an academy award nomination. This film isn't a retelling of Khan's life in his height of power but rather, a biopic about his ascendance to becoming the ""Khan"" of all Mongols from such humble beginnings. The film's premise is very similar to the Japanese produced film, Genghis Khan: to the Ends of the Earth and Sea. This film is the first part of an intended trilogy about the life of Khan.The story begins when we see a young Temudjin (Tadanobu Asano) looking for a bride. He chooses a young girl named Borte to be his wife in five years. After his father`s death, young Temudjin, is forced to flee when his father's second in command decides to take over. The film delves into the life of Temudjin through his journey that will lead him to become one of the greatest conquerors the world has ever known.I am well aware that it is impossible to compress the life of a man as colorful as Genghis Khan in a measly two hours plus. It all depended on the filmmaker's approach on how and what needed to be put into bear in the film's running time. Just where does fact and fiction begin and end? The film certainly does feel rather a bit rushed to cover as much ground as possible that it jumps around in timeline. The film does have the usual themes of brotherhood, loyalty, family and commitment. The characters may feel a little underdeveloped and some knowledge in Khan's history would be an advantage in order to appreciate the film. It was a little curious as to some scenes seemed a little irrelevant but I do think that the filmmakers wanted to focus on Temudjin's relationship and devotion to his wife Borte.Borte (played by Khulan Chuluun) is no mere wife to Temudjin. This character is almost as stubborn and strong-willed as her husband. She has her own story to tell, she exhibits her devotion and undying love to Temudjin in ways that would seem almost unbelievable. The phrase; ""stand by your man"" can be the film's major selling point. Borte would do anything to save and preserve her relationship to Temudjin; to the point of even selling her body. Tadanobu Asano's performance is definitely one for the record books, and the actor carries most of the film's burden along with Chuluun. Asano plays the grim, brooding conqueror very convincingly. The man is such a chameleon, he can adapt to almost any role from ""Party 7"" to ""A Taste Of Tea"" to ""Mongol"". The film portrays Khan as an inspiration and a man of destiny, which is a change from other portrayals of the Mongol conqueror (other depictions show him to be a heartless, ruthless ruler). His intimidating figure has been downplayed a little to show the humanity inside, and this could be a double-edged sword.The film is so far from perfect. Aside from the script feeling a bit rushed, the film does have its share of obvious fictional elements. There are touches of mysticism in the film; Temudjin relationship with the Mongol God of the Sky Tengri seemed rather too heavy-handed. The scene with the Chinese monk does do a great job in setting up the film's final act but it felt too convenient, (luckily this played out well in the film's end). It would also have been extremely helpful if they fleshed out Temudjin's character as to how he developed into such a skilled general. The emphasis on the ""man of destiny"" formula did rather overstay its welcome somewhat.Of course, with a film about Genghis Khan, you can expect some battle scenes. There are actually two major sequences of bloodshed; the raid on a Merkit camp and the final battle between Temudjin and his ""blood brother"" Jamukha (Sung Hong Ley). The two sequences are quite decent although lacking in intense spectacle as we're used to other grand epics such as ""LOTR"" and ""Braveheart"". The final result of the climactic battle also does feel rather silly and failed to be impressive. (even if its resolution was backed by historical records)Much to the film's credit, the film's cinematography and camerawork are quite impressive. The film definitely looks quite nifty. The costumes and set designs does provide the proper atmosphere for a historical epic, despite the sometimes lackluster execution. The cast is also mostly made up of actual Mongols and the dialogue is in Mongol which does give the film a lot of ambition in regards for an epic feel. Sung Hong Ley almost steals the spotlight as Jamukha, clearly director Bodrov picked the right actor to play Temudjin's rival.Complaints aside, ""Mongol"" is actually a good film. The film is entertaining enough despite its uneven and heavy-handed elements. The great performances and the film's pace does provide an entertaining experience. It does lack a bit in the action sequences, so folks who are looking for a bloody film may be disappointed. Just keep in mind that this is the first installment in an intended trilogy; the bloodiest and most exciting aspects of Khan's life may still be forthcoming.Recommended!

1110165,A3O536E2YOKK4Y,B000WLYDNM,Wuchak,"[0, 0]","As a boy, I had somewhat of a fascination with Genghis Khan (the Great King) and even drew a picture of him titled, naturally, ""Temujin,"" his actual name. I don't know what it was that attracted me; likely his cool-sounding title and world-conquering exploits.  With the exception of Iron Maiden's great instrumental, ""Genghis Khan,"" that ended my flirtation with this historical figure. That is, until I saw the Russian-made ""Mongol: The Rise of Genghis Khan"" (2007) yesterday.As the title would suggest, the film explores Temujin's origins and what led to him becoming the great king of the Mongols and world-terrorizer. Despite being a foreign film with subtitles the movie successfully pulled me into its world and characters. The Mongols on the vast Asian steppes lived similar to American plains Indians. I've seen numerous photos of Mongols living on the steppes with their yurts, etc. over the years, but I could never relate to them as people. Just as, say, ""Dances with Wolves (Full Screen Theatrical Edition)"" made American Natives come alive to the viewer so this film does with Mongols.""Mongol"" eschews the American ""blockbuster"" syndrome and simply tells the story of Temujin from his early boyhood to his crowning as the great Khan. Although there's a steady amount of action throughout, there are a lot of quiet lulls with Temujin calmly waiting-out his various imprisonments and seeking Tengri, the god of the blue skies. Regardless, I found myself drawn into the characters and simple story.I liked the fact that a monk was able to ""see"" Temujin's greatness and future world-conquering potential even though he was only a lowly slave, which others understandably couldn't see. I also liked the low-key commentary on people choosing their leaders and forsaking the less worthy, and the resulting strife, as well as the focus on Temujin's many quiet times in the wilderness seeking the Divine for wisdom and power to walk in his greatness and fulfill his dream, not that I'm suggesting Genghis Khan was God-ordained, of course. The lead actors are all great, especially Honglei Sun as Jamukha, Temujin's ""brother"" and then greatest enemy in Mongolia. Despite all this, people who require constant roll-your-eyes action and explosions will likely find ""Mongol"" boring.Speaking of ""constant roll-your-eyes action,"" this was the very thing that ruined the recent ""Conan the Barbarian"" with Jason Momoa, who was excellent in the role. That film needed more downtime, realism and depth, similar to the original 1982 version (not that that version didn't have its share of cartoony-ness), the filmmakers instead pushed for overkill action and minimal weight. The result? A mediocre Conan flick that looked great but was ultimately too shallow and goofy, in the ""action-packed blockbuster"" sense. Interestingly, ""Mongol"" reminded me of John Milius' version of ""Conan the Barbarian"" and of Robert E. Howard's Conan in general, albeit without the sorcery. I believe if the 2011 remake of ""Conan"" shot for the realism and seriousness of ""Mongol,"" as REH himself portrayed the character and the Hyborian Age, it would have been a more worthy Conan film. It goes without saying, if you like REH and Conan you'll probably appreciate ""Mongol.""The locations are gorgeous, shot on the remote and godly landscapes of Inner Mongolia, China, and Kazakhstan.The soundtrack is simple but effective, often just an eerie-sounding violin/cello. I found it interesting that when the credits hit a great epic metal riff kicked in for a few bars before morphing into the expected Eastern-styled credits soundtrack. It was a pleasant surprise.GRADE: A- or B+",5,The origins of the great mongol khan,1331078400,"03 7, 2012",2012,3646,"['boy', 'had', 'somewhat', 'fascination', 'Genghis', 'Khan', 'Great', 'King', 'even', 'drew', 'picture', 'titled', 'naturally', 'Temujin', 'actual', 'name', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'was', 'attracted', 'likely', 'cool-sounding', 'title', 'world-conquering', 'exploits', 'exception', 'Iron', 'Maiden', 'great', 'instrumental', 'Genghis', 'Khan', 'ended', 'flirtation', 'historical', 'figure', 'saw', 'Russian-made', 'Mongol', 'Rise', 'Genghis', 'Khan', '2007', 'title', 'would', 'suggest', 'film', 'Temujin', 'origins', 'led', 'becoming', 'great', 'king', 'Mongols', 'world-terrorizer', 'being', 'foreign', 'film', 'subtitles', 'movie', 'successfully', 'pulled', 'world', 'characters', 'Mongols', 'vast', 'Asian', 'steppes', 'lived', 'similar', 'American', 'plains', 'Indians', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'numerous', 'photos', 'Mongols', 'living', 'steppes', 'yurts', 'etc', 'years', 'could', 'never', 'relate', 'people', 'Just', 'say', 'Dances', 'Wolves', 'Full', 'Screen', 'Theatrical', 'Edition', 'made', 'American', 'Natives', 'come', 'alive', 'viewer', 'film', 'Mongols', 'Mongol', 'American', 'blockbuster', 'syndrome', 'simply', 'tells', 'story', 'Temujin', 'early', 'boyhood', 'crowning', 'great', 'Khan', 'steady', 'amount', 'action', 'are', 'lot', 'quiet', 'lulls', 'Temujin', 'calmly', 'various', 'imprisonments', 'seeking', 'Tengri', 'god', 'blue', 'skies', 'Regardless', 'found', 'drawn', 'characters', 'simple', 'story.I', 'liked', 'fact', 'monk', 'was', 'able', 'see', 'Temujin', 'greatness', 'future', 'world-conquering', 'potential', 'even', 'was', 'only', 'lowly', 'slave', 'others', 'understandably', 'could', ""n't"", 'see', 'also', 'liked', 'low-key', 'commentary', 'people', 'choosing', 'leaders', 'forsaking', 'less', 'worthy', 'resulting', 'strife', 'as', 'well', 'focus', 'Temujin', 'many', 'quiet', 'times', 'wilderness', 'seeking', 'Divine', 'wisdom', 'power', 'walk', 'greatness', 'fulfill', 'dream', 'not', ""'m"", 'suggesting', 'Genghis', 'Khan', 'was', 'God-ordained', 'course', 'lead', 'actors', 'are', 'great', 'especially', 'Honglei', 'Sun', 'Jamukha', 'Temujin', 'brother', 'then', 'greatest', 'enemy', 'Mongolia', 'people', 'who', 'require', 'constant', 'roll-your-eyes', 'action', 'explosions', 'will', 'likely', 'find', 'Mongol', 'boring.Speaking', 'constant', 'roll-your-eyes', 'action', 'was', 'very', 'thing', 'ruined', 'recent', 'Conan', 'Barbarian', 'Jason', 'Momoa', 'who', 'was', 'excellent', 'role', 'film', 'needed', 'more', 'downtime', 'realism', 'depth', 'similar', 'original', '1982', 'version', 'not', 'version', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'share', 'cartoony-ness', 'filmmakers', 'instead', 'pushed', 'overkill', 'action', 'minimal', 'weight', 'result', 'mediocre', 'Conan', 'flick', 'looked', 'great', 'was', 'ultimately', 'too', 'shallow', 'goofy', 'action-packed', 'blockbuster', 'sense', 'Interestingly', 'Mongol', 'reminded', 'John', 'Milius', 'version', 'Conan', 'Barbarian', 'Robert', 'E.', 'Howard', 'Conan', 'general', 'sorcery', 'believe', '2011', 'remake', 'Conan', 'shot', 'realism', 'seriousness', 'Mongol', 'REH', 'portrayed', 'character', 'Hyborian', 'Age', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'worthy', 'Conan', 'film', 'saying', 'like', 'REH', 'Conan', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'appreciate', 'Mongol', 'locations', 'are', 'gorgeous', 'shot', 'remote', 'godly', 'landscapes', 'Inner', 'Mongolia', 'China', 'Kazakhstan.The', 'soundtrack', 'simple', 'effective', 'often', 'just', 'eerie-sounding', 'violin/cello', 'found', 'interesting', 'when', 'credits', 'hit', 'great', 'epic', 'metal', 'riff', 'kicked', 'few', 'bars', 'morphing', 'expected', 'Eastern-styled', 'credits', 'soundtrack', 'was', 'pleasant', 'surprise.GRADE', 'A-', 'B+']",Mongol: The Early Years of Genghis Khan
