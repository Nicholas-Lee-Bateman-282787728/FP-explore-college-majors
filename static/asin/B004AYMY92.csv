The storyline is about the love between two women in southern Italy sometime in the late 19th century. But the movie should not be watched for the lesbian story, rather - here is the twist - for the duplicity of all characters.The duplicity of the main character is the life she is forced to live to be able to be with the woman she loves. I do believe, however, that this is the excuse for the narrative to delve on the duplicity of life at large, something that most of us have to endure in life. Maybe this duplicity is sexual orientation, maybe it is an illicit affair, or maybe it is painful guilt &#8230; the main point of the movie IMHO is precisely to tell several stories of duplicity and how that affects our social interactions, our families, our lives.The movie is in italian, but, as a note for those looking for italian spoken movies, it is strongly regional italian, precisely sicilian.",4,interesting twist,1390089600,"01 19, 2014",2014,1215,"['good', 'movie', 'story', 'bit', 'farcical', 'hardly', 'believable', 'realize', 'now', 'lesbian', 'story', 'not', 'main', 'point', 'movie', 'rather', 'duplicity', 'character', 'movie', 'duplicate', 'self', 'parallel', 'self', 'out', 'movie', 'sometimes', 'pathos', 'sometimes', 'not', 'storyline', 'love', 'two', 'women', 'southern', 'Italy', 'sometime', 'late', '19th', 'century', 'movie', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'watched', 'lesbian', 'story', 'rather', 'here', 'twist', 'duplicity', 'characters.The', 'duplicity', 'main', 'character', 'life', 'forced', 'live', 'be', 'able', 'be', 'woman', 'do', 'believe', 'however', 'excuse', 'narrative', 'delve', 'duplicity', 'life', 'large', 'something', 'most', 'have', 'endure', 'life', 'Maybe', 'duplicity', 'sexual', 'orientation', 'maybe', 'illicit', 'affair', 'maybe', 'painful', 'guilt', '8230', 'main', 'point', 'movie', 'IMHO', 'precisely', 'tell', 'several', 'stories', 'duplicity', 'how', 'social', 'interactions', 'families', 'lives.The', 'movie', 'italian', 'note', 'looking', 'italian', 'spoken', 'movies', 'strongly', 'regional', 'italian', 'precisely', 'sicilian']",Purple Sea

When Angela falls in love with best friend Sara (Isabella Ragonese), she wants to be with no one but her. Angela's father attempts to force her into marriage are useless; she states that she will only marry Sara. When her father's violence forces her into a basement dungeon, she chooses death rather than marry the man her father has chosen for her.Angela's mother Lucia comes up with an ingenious solution, which involves Angela becoming the son her father had always wanted. As Lucia has information that the local priest would prefer not come to light, she blackmails him into changing Angela's sex on the birth register. Once Angela is officially Angelo, she cuts her hair, dons men's clothing, and marries her sweetheart, Sara. Life seems idyllic for the women living as husband and wife; however, there are rumblings beneath the surface of the small community.Based on the novel Minchia di Re by Giacomo Pilati, Donatella Maiorca brings to the screen a wonderful period piece of young love and strong female characters that challenge societal norms in order to be together. The weather beaten Sicilian coast is a breathtaking backdrop for the women's growing passion and intense love scenes. This expertly woven drama is based on a true story.The incredibly talented leads Valeria Solarino and Isabella Ragonese are both stunning. The chemistry between the women is so genuine that their ardent loves scenes appear incredibly real.

It touches much broader aspects of life, the transcendence of love, the female archetype, societal roles, the conflict that can arise when following one's heart and it does it in a beautiful way.  It is about two women who are very much in love. One, so very sure about love and its expressions, bearing the weight and cost of that (societal) naivete. It takes a few minutes for the other to catch up which seems natural when one is offered a possibility they didn't know existed. Sex is truly an expression of their love. It doesn't hurt they take off their clothes because it hits the societal role issues head on. It's also aesthetically beautiful and took my breath away.

Taking place in 19th century Sicily.  It covers a timeline of two young girls  from childhood to adult hood where they discover they love eachother.  Angela's Father is  a tyrant, her Mother cowers at the  sight of him.  Angela;s Father arranges for her to marry one of the men that work for him ,it is at this point Angela rebels  telling her Father she loves Sara. and will not marry the man he has chosen.  He beats her and throws her into an underground  bunker  . It is his plan to leave her threre until she changes her ways,  after a very long time her Mother  finally comes to her rescue  and takes things into her own hands  takes  Angela from the bunker.  Angela's Mother convinces her Father  that  they can tell people Angel was wrongly  identified as a girl at birth  and that he could finally have the son he wanted. Now she is Angelo and takesover her Fathers work at the quarry.  While it is difficult  portraying  a man Angela does what she has to in order to have Sara.  There is much more to this movie but I don't want to spoil it  if you decide to watch it. This is a touching love story  between two women during a time when  if you were gay or lesbian you were  a monster and banished from the family .  I found it to be a well done movie.",5,Well done.,1375401600,"08 2, 2013",2013,1387,"['have', 'ROKU', 'Amazon', 'Prime', 'Instant', 'Video', '.First', 'will', 'warn', 'sexually', 'explicit', 'movie.This', 'well', 'done', 'film', 'Taking', 'place', '19th', 'century', 'Sicily', 'timeline', 'two', 'young', 'girls', 'childhood', 'adult', 'hood', 'where', 'discover', 'love', 'eachother', 'Angela', 'Father', 'tyrant', 'Mother', 'cowers', 'sight', 'Angela', 'Father', 'arranges', 'marry', 'one', 'men', 'work', 'point', 'Angela', 'rebels', 'telling', 'Father', 'Sara', 'will', 'not', 'marry', 'man', 'chosen', 'underground', 'bunker', 'plan', 'leave', 'threre', 'ways', 'very', 'long', 'time', 'Mother', 'finally', 'rescue', 'things', 'own', 'hands', 'Angela', 'bunker', 'Angela', 'Mother', 'Father', 'can', 'tell', 'people', 'Angel', 'was', 'wrongly', 'identified', 'girl', 'birth', 'could', 'finally', 'have', 'son', 'wanted', 'Now', 'Angelo', 'takesover', 'Fathers', 'work', 'quarry', 'difficult', 'portraying', 'man', 'Angela', 'what', 'order', 'have', 'Sara', 'much', 'more', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'spoil', 'decide', 'watch', 'touching', 'love', 'story', 'two', 'women', 'time', 'when', 'were', 'gay', 'lesbian', 'were', 'monster', 'banished', 'family', 'found', 'be', 'well', 'done', 'movie']",Purple Sea

1394105,A1WM5FNKKVRAQ2,B004AYMY92,YAC,"[1, 1]","In a word - wonderful.  This is now my equal favorite with Elena Undone.  I agree with one of the reviewers - too bad I can't read the book, supposedly based on a true story.  It might explain/clarify one or two of the puzzling scenes and characters (the father and the Baroness).  But must say that this film is very, very well done and that the actresses were terrific in conveying overwhelming love, tenderness and genuine passion.  I wish I understood Italian, since a couple of sub titles did not match what was really said (I understand Spanish and a little of school book Italian), so I wonder what might I have missed throughout.  These are legit actors in this film.  In fact, Maria Grazia, a top Italian actress is also - if I read the credits correctly - a producer as well as playing Agnes. The lovely music flows well with the movie and both the men and a few women were eye-candy, especially Valeria Solarino.  Quite a brave pair these two given the time period it takes place in.  In this particular case, love does conquer all.  You can't help being caught up in it and I plan to buy it.  I'm positive this film is not for everybody, but for those romantic, quixotic souls out there - yes indeed it is!  The end left me wanting to know more - does Angela/Angelo revert to her true nature as a proud woman or remain disguised as a man as she was forced to in order to obtain her Sara?  It begs an answer..............",5,I think I'm in love..............,1392940800,"02 21, 2014",2014,1432,"['word', 'wonderful', 'now', 'equal', 'favorite', 'Elena', 'Undone', 'agree', 'one', 'reviewers', 'too', 'bad', 'ca', ""n't"", 'read', 'book', 'supposedly', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'might', 'explain/clarify', 'one', 'two', 'puzzling', 'scenes', 'characters', 'father', 'Baroness', 'must', 'say', 'film', 'very', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'actresses', 'were', 'terrific', 'conveying', 'overwhelming', 'love', 'tenderness', 'genuine', 'passion', 'wish', 'understood', 'Italian', 'couple', 'sub', 'titles', 'did', 'not', 'match', 'what', 'was', 'really', 'said', 'understand', 'Spanish', 'little', 'school', 'book', 'Italian', 'so', 'wonder', 'what', 'might', 'have', 'missed', 'are', 'legit', 'actors', 'film', 'fact', 'Maria', 'Grazia', 'top', 'Italian', 'actress', 'also', 'read', 'credits', 'correctly', 'producer', 'as', 'well', 'playing', 'Agnes', 'lovely', 'music', 'well', 'movie', 'men', 'few', 'women', 'were', 'eye-candy', 'especially', 'Valeria', 'Solarino', 'brave', 'pair', 'two', 'given', 'time', 'period', 'place', 'particular', 'case', 'love', 'conquer', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'being', 'caught', 'up', 'plan', 'buy', ""'m"", 'positive', 'film', 'not', 'everybody', 'romantic', 'quixotic', 'souls', 'there', 'yes', 'indeed', 'end', 'left', 'wanting', 'know', 'more', 'Angela/Angelo', 'revert', 'true', 'nature', 'proud', 'woman', 'remain', 'disguised', 'man', 'was', 'forced', 'order', 'obtain', 'Sara', 'answer', '..']",Purple Sea
