How could anyone except a twisted maniac take a film as wonderful as the Neverending Story and produce a pile of rubbish like THIS as a sequel?I had read the negative reviews on here, and thought, could it really be that bad, or are reviewers just giving it the same treatment they did Part 2 because it has a few minor differences that can be overlooked with relative ease.Well, I'm afraid I have to fall in with the majority of reviewers in my opinions.  I found a copy at my local library where I checked it out for free, and MAN did it blow!  There was yet another kid playing Bastian, who apparently got tired of the dye job and is back to brunette.  Again kid's tastes change on a near daily basis at that age, so that much can be easily overlooked.  But then we get to the story.

413230,AAEP8YFERQ8FC,6304291361,General Breadbasket,"[12, 14]","I remember watching ""The NeverEnding Story III"" in the cinema as a kid. It was probably the first time I ever felt disappointed in a piece of entertainment. The sets and effects were all of the same standard as the first two, yeah, but everything else was a bit of a mess. I hoped it would be a little better, watching it on DVD. It ended up being just as messy, actually.Bastian (Jason James Richter in this film) has moved to a new school, and he's finding it hard to fit in, having trouble with a group of bullies called the Nasties (their leader played by a younger Jack Black). Bastian's also finding it hard to fit into his new family. His father has remarried, and Bastian now has a cynical step sister and a nervous new stepmother. Still, there's a familiar face at the school library, the antique bookseller from the first two films: Mr Koreander. He has brought the books from his store too, placing them on the library shelves. Among these is the NeverEnding Story, which Bastian takes once more, wishing himself into the pages. Now abandoned, the bullies take hold of the book, and by their reading of it, begin to reshape not only the world of Fantasia, but the real world too (as it's part of Bastian's story). Will Bastian be able to save both worlds from this nastiness?It starts off promising enough, sweeping fantasy landscapes during the title sequence, but that all quickly gives way to a lot of cheesiness. Rockbiter has a wife in hair curlers, watches a TV in Fantasia, and gets to sing ""Born to Be Wild"". His son Junior now has a ridiculous voice, as does Falcor the Luck Dragon, who has gone from being a noble, encouraging creature to being accident prone and reluctant to face danger. The Childlike Empress, usually such a pure character, wishes that she should go clothes shopping, while the two Gnomes spend most of the movie looking for a toilet. The dialogue is a bit cheesy at times too. Regarding Bastian, Engywook (a Fantasia Gnome) says ""He's no Arnold Schwartznegger in the muscle department"". If he's a fantasy character, how does he know about action movies? Barky, the tree man, also spouts a lot of cheesy cultural references, probably more than anyone else. These is a lot of very 1990s pop music in the background, which by itself wouldn't be so bad, but in the midst of all the mess seems to heighten the cheesiness.I was disappointed as a kid with this film, yeah, but now I kind of watch it in a ""so bad it's good"" kind of way. I was laughing so hard watching the scenes with Junior Rockbiter and Falcor, just at their voices, the dialogue, and the silliness of the scene they were in. It would be hard to purposely make a film this so far from the first two films and the original book. Even though it is ridiculous, it's still pretty engaging too. I certainly wasn't bored watching the film. I was a lot of other things, but I definitely wasn't bored.Though I prefer the first two films (the first most of all), this one is worth a look, just to see how unusual it turned out. It definitely makes for something to talk about.",3,How to End a NeverEnding Story?,1161907200,"10 27, 2006",2006,3071,"['remember', 'watching', 'NeverEnding', 'Story', 'III', 'cinema', 'kid', 'was', 'probably', 'first', 'time', 'ever', 'felt', 'disappointed', 'piece', 'entertainment', 'sets', 'effects', 'were', 'same', 'standard', 'first', 'two', 'yeah', 'everything', 'else', 'was', 'bit', 'mess', 'hoped', 'would', 'be', 'little', 'better', 'watching', 'DVD', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'just', 'messy', 'actually.Bastian', 'Jason', 'James', 'Richter', 'film', 'moved', 'new', 'school', 'finding', 'hard', 'fit', 'having', 'trouble', 'group', 'bullies', 'called', 'Nasties', 'leader', 'played', 'younger', 'Jack', 'Black', 'Bastian', 'also', 'finding', 'hard', 'fit', 'new', 'family', 'father', 'remarried', 'Bastian', 'now', 'cynical', 'step', 'sister', 'nervous', 'new', 'stepmother', 'Still', 'familiar', 'face', 'school', 'library', 'antique', 'bookseller', 'first', 'two', 'films', 'Mr', 'Koreander', 'brought', 'books', 'store', 'too', 'placing', 'library', 'shelves', 'NeverEnding', 'Story', 'Bastian', 'once', 'more', 'wishing', 'pages', 'Now', 'abandoned', 'bullies', 'take', 'hold', 'book', 'reading', 'begin', 'reshape', 'not', 'only', 'world', 'Fantasia', 'real', 'world', 'too', 'part', 'Bastian', 'story', 'Will', 'Bastian', 'be', 'able', 'save', 'worlds', 'nastiness', 'promising', 'enough', 'sweeping', 'fantasy', 'landscapes', 'title', 'sequence', 'quickly', 'way', 'lot', 'cheesiness', 'Rockbiter', 'wife', 'hair', 'curlers', 'TV', 'Fantasia', 'sing', 'Born', 'Be', 'Wild', 'son', 'Junior', 'now', 'ridiculous', 'voice', 'Falcor', 'Luck', 'Dragon', 'who', 'gone', 'being', 'noble', 'encouraging', 'creature', 'being', 'accident', 'prone', 'reluctant', 'face', 'danger', 'Childlike', 'Empress', 'usually', 'such', 'pure', 'character', 'should', 'go', 'clothes', 'shopping', 'two', 'Gnomes', 'spend', 'most', 'movie', 'looking', 'toilet', 'dialogue', 'bit', 'cheesy', 'times', 'too', 'Regarding', 'Bastian', 'Engywook', 'Fantasia', 'Gnome', 'Arnold', 'Schwartznegger', 'muscle', 'department', 'fantasy', 'character', 'how', 'know', 'action', 'movies', 'Barky', 'tree', 'man', 'also', 'lot', 'cheesy', 'cultural', 'references', 'probably', 'more', 'anyone', 'else', 'lot', 'very', '1990s', 'pop', 'music', 'background', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'so', 'bad', 'midst', 'mess', 'heighten', 'cheesiness.I', 'was', 'disappointed', 'kid', 'film', 'yeah', 'now', 'kind', 'watch', 'so', 'bad', 'good', 'kind', 'way', 'was', 'laughing', 'so', 'hard', 'watching', 'scenes', 'Junior', 'Rockbiter', 'Falcor', 'just', 'voices', 'dialogue', 'silliness', 'scene', 'were', 'would', 'be', 'hard', 'purposely', 'make', 'film', 'so', 'far', 'first', 'two', 'films', 'original', 'book', 'Even', 'ridiculous', 'still', 'pretty', 'engaging', 'too', 'certainly', 'was', ""n't"", 'bored', 'watching', 'film', 'was', 'lot', 'other', 'things', 'definitely', 'was', ""n't"", 'bored.Though', 'prefer', 'first', 'two', 'films', 'first', 'most', 'one', 'look', 'just', 'see', 'how', 'unusual', 'turned', 'out', 'definitely', 'something', 'talk']",The NeverEnding Story III - Escape From Fantasia VHS

I consider it a major mistake to take the story into the human realm instead of leaving it totally in Fantasia as was done in 1 and 2.  The plot is supposed to be a fantasy storyline instigated by Bastian's imagination. A child's fantasy cannot change or control what happens in his/her real world, as it did in Neverending Story 3. Although the ending was nice, it is not logical that a child's fantasy can change people as it did with members of the gang.  And it is not likely that the human realm would be able to control what happens in the fantasy world, except in a child's imagination.Also, Bastian's dad did not seem to have a clue about Fantasia and the book. This broke the consistency in the trilogy in that his dad was definitely a part of Story 2.In my mind, the story was essentially a tale of a boy moving to a new school, adjusting to a melded family, and dealing with bullies at school. It is not a story line that I would choose to watch. I was hoping that the story would evolve to concentrating more on Fantasia, but it was minorly about Fantasia.Basically, mixing Bastian's fantasy/imaginary world with the real world and taking characters out of Fantasia and placing them in the real world did not work for me.

When I saw the second movie in the theater when I was 11 years old, I was very disappointed to say the least (after just having read the book by Michael Ende), so I can't say I had high hopes watching the third one at the age of 26, but what I did have was quickly crushed. I had to give it a shot because the plot of the book has only barely begun when the first movie ends, so I was curious to see if it did a better job of continuing the book than the second movie. But it was in fact as much beneath the second as the second was beneath the first and having even less to do with the book, in a comparison like a planet to a tennis ball to an atom. Simply put, it was an insult on the original and to the book. No longer is there the dark, serious atmosphere to Fantasia (Fantastica in the book) of the first movie, the land of myths, legends, heroes and monsters, with hidden surprises and amusing novelties, but now (I don't know how better to describe it) it is a place that doesn't take itself seriously. It was no longer a world on its own, it was a forgery. A footnote to the 'real' world, with moronic consequences. MM Power Rangers sort of moronic. Yeah, that moronic. But it was when the characters established in the first movie came out that it just went so wrong. I was more than a little dismayed when the miserly Engywook suddenly had been changed in a couple noticible and detrimental ways, but I could tolerate no more when they introduced Falkor, the luck dragon. They totally ruined the character. I couldn't stand to watch any more. I was so disgusted I decided to go out of my way to put it in a review to warn people about this insult of a movie, and here you are, reading it. Not only was Alan Oppenheimer, perhaps better known as the voice of Cringer (and Battlecat), Skeletor and Man-at-Arms from the infamous He-Man cartoon, no longer the voice and replaced with something that wasn't even close and totally wrong in every way, but he was all dopey, clumsy and dumb as a sack of doorknobs instead of suave, charismatic and mysterious as he ought to have been.

Yes.. Jack Black is in it.. but it is nothing like the original movie..and is so far away from the norm' it is like they made the whole movie A JOKE. The story of ""The Neverending Story"" is a fantastical fantasy tale w/ good acting and very nice special effects and animation.. They took the Rockbiter who is a big as a mountain and has a deep sensitive voice and turned it into a goofy bad night at Comedy Central character about the size of an adult. Instead of a tale survived by a boy and his Father.. ( which each movie somehow has  a new different boy and a different parent..)..THIS one is about a boy and his Mother.. ( who had died in the Neverending Story 1). It is like watching a comedy spoof of a good movie and they absolutely RUINED IT !!  I wanted the complete set but I definately could have lived w/out this version. SAD ..very SAD..the Fantasia characters throw one liners out like they know all about the Human World and the innocent sweet princess is a joke as well. It is poorly acted and Falcor looks like a muppet version of a dog. He does not look real and fantastical like he does in 1.

Two days ago I saw the III in ToysRus for $4.99.  This has nothing to do with the original books.  However, I have to give the credit to the screen play to try to make it something educating for the new family formed by the previously divorced family.  Children are hurting from their past experience and the void of the last parent is hard to make up for.  The story move more out of fantasia to the human world and Holloween theme fell into it nicely. I think the director is trying to tell people not to be so nasty toward each other.  This is very good because the next generation kid's attitude toward us senior are very rude.  I wish the film could be more fun like the original Never Ending Story.

The first two series of Neverending story are based on Michael Ende's masterpiece juvenile literature. This one is purely original story using the theme and characters from this book. The first movie was so successful that the very concept of the original story is left neglected. Second and third series tried to get things right only in vain. Fantasia is a creation of human mind so when we changes the story changes that is what neverending story is. Auryn is as second series nicely put it, not a magic stick. Third series is no exception. Bastian's new sister used Auryn to buy what she wanted then the side effect was their newly-wed parents are in danger of divorce. This story's not a fantasy story at all. It is more real than you imagine. It is too bad a time to make neverending story movie at all during dark 90s. Maybe this time will be more acceptable to have another series.
