Claar ""they call me Groo""","[0, 0]","I'll be honest, I only watched this because I was tired, it was free (Prime membership rocks!), and I wanted to see some ""candy"".  I thought I'd watch for a bit and then switch to something more worthwhile after I got my fix.  But the movie was really funny, and the acting was good.  The situations weren't over played, and mostly non-cliche, which was the most surprising.  I've never seen Carmen in a movie before, and while she's no Hepburn, I really liked her in this.  Now that I've seen this, I think I'll stop avoiding films with her in them (sorry about that Carmen).  Anyway, to sum it up, instead of getting my ""candy"" fix, I got my ""really good comedy"" fix instead.  Very worth watching.",4,"Surprisingly funny, well written, and acted (sorry guys...)",1311638400,"07 26, 2011",2011,699,"[""'ll"", 'be', 'honest', 'only', 'watched', 'was', 'tired', 'was', 'free', 'Prime', 'membership', 'rocks', 'wanted', 'see', 'candy', 'thought', ""'d"", 'watch', 'bit', 'then', 'switch', 'something', 'more', 'worthwhile', 'got', 'fix', 'movie', 'was', 'really', 'funny', 'acting', 'was', 'good', 'situations', 'were', ""n't"", 'played', 'mostly', 'non-cliche', 'was', 'most', 'surprising', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'Carmen', 'movie', 'Hepburn', 'really', 'liked', 'Now', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'think', ""'ll"", 'stop', 'avoiding', 'films', 'sorry', 'Carmen', 'Anyway', 'sum', 'up', 'instead', 'getting', 'candy', 'fix', 'got', 'really', 'good', 'comedy', 'fix', 'instead', 'Very', 'worth', 'watching']",I Want Candy

Every turn in the script was totally unbelievable, and it was not very funny.Maybe some will like it.

1170749,A22Q3DG4CHS4JA,B001B7CNWO,"Jelly Jar ""Granny""","[36, 41]","Okay, I love Carmen Electra...she has a figure to die for, however, the concept of the movie and the DVD cover are EXTREMELY deceptive. There isn't a whole lot of Carmen at all in this flick. The character she plays is supposed to be a porn star, so you would think that she would show some skin when she does appear, right?WRONG! There is more nudity in a Gremlins movie than in this cheeseball!You can get a good look at her from behind about...oh, let's see...once, and she's only in lingerie throughout the entire flick, which is about all she wears on a day to day basis anyway.So don't get your hopes up if you think you're going to see Carmen's fabulous figure in any more than her normal everyday pictures that are strewn out by the millions all over the internet.ENOUGH ABOUT THAT...ON TO THE MOVIE:A one star stinker!The acting is ridiculously bad, the plot premise is way too far-fetched to take itself seriously (even for a comedy)! Who are these people anyway? I haven't heard of a single one of them being in any other notable movies!

He plays quite a brat, producer, smooth dick to Tom Burke's sulking wannabe director. They, driven by the absolute need to make a movie, any movie, find themselves making soft porn with Candy Fiveways (Carmen Electra). Yeay.Ensues lots of porn/cooking gags. Some good, some not so great. Something lacks in this movie, something about heart... or maybe it's too long... or the actors fail to convince.Maybe it's a case of them having far too good a time making the damn thing, leaving us with the crumbs.
