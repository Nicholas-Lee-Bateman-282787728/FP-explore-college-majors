1531227,A14Y2BFP2PTJP2,B007I6T9MY,"Endora Aphrattos ""Endora Aphrattos""","[1, 2]","Shirley Temple Was the iconic child of millions.  Tragically we did not get to see much from her in latter years apart from her husband related news.  They tried to keep her a child for far too long and not allow her to grow-up.  When finally they knew it was a hopeless battle and did allow it, they tried to follow the same, olde pattern and that is what ruined her career.  These films are the beloved of many.  These are not the best of her movies, but, surely amongst them.  Each collection has a mix of popular and less popular films.  Well worth the price.  I love them for the most part.  However anyone not familiar with her work should remember one thing.  This is filmed in a different era... 80 years ago or so if not more.  Their problems as a culture were often depicted and in some cases may seem odd.  If you are a fan of family cinema (because they are built around a child but not children's films) then these are must have.",5,Incomperable,1373500800,"07 11, 2013",2013,942,"['Shirley', 'Temple', 'Was', 'iconic', 'child', 'millions', 'Tragically', 'did', 'not', 'get', 'see', 'much', 'latter', 'years', 'apart', 'husband', 'related', 'news', 'tried', 'keep', 'child', 'far', 'too', 'long', 'not', 'allow', 'grow-up', 'When', 'finally', 'knew', 'was', 'hopeless', 'battle', 'did', 'allow', 'tried', 'follow', 'same', 'olde', 'pattern', 'what', 'ruined', 'career', 'films', 'are', 'beloved', 'many', 'are', 'not', 'best', 'movies', 'surely', 'collection', 'mix', 'popular', 'less', 'popular', 'films', 'Well', 'price', 'love', 'most', 'part', 'However', 'anyone', 'not', 'familiar', 'work', 'should', 'remember', 'one', 'thing', 'filmed', 'different', 'era', '80', 'years', 'ago', 'so', 'not', 'more', 'problems', 'culture', 'were', 'often', 'depicted', 'cases', 'may', 'seem', 'odd', 'are', 'fan', 'family', 'cinema', 'are', 'built', 'child', 'not', 'children', 'films', 'then', 'are', 'must', 'have']","Shirley Temple Collection, The Volume 3"
