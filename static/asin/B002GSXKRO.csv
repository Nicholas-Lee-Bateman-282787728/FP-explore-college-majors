And with Xavier, what you have is a show not for the masses at all -- and certainly not for the typical Adult Swim set. This is a total work of GENIUS, and I don't throw that word around very often.Surreal, bizarre, seemingly-100% nonsensical at times... but so, SO unbelievably consistently hilarious, intelligent, and clever. Have you seen a television show lately that you could describe as ""mindblowing""? Probably not. Well, this is your show. It's probably way too intelligent for the average Adult Swim viewer... hell, it's probably way too intelligent even for the people who enjoy the show!  There's ALWAYS some new line to pick up on.  I've watched some episodes 10 times and still catch new things. It's hard to describe in detail how absolutely INSANE this show is!But if you're the typical Adult Swim fan, you may want to pass on this one... however, if you're into the films of Lynch, Giuseppe Andrews, Jodorowsky, etc. or the music of The Residents, Harry Partch, Captain Beefheart... you know, the truly bizarre and ""outside"" part of the entertainment world... you will most likely love this exploration of existentialism and absurdity. This show is probably the most insanely and violently brilliant thing on television. Ever. So unbelievably packed with sight gags and clever quips, an 11 minute episode has more energy and ideas than entire seasons of pretty much every other show you can think of.Never have I seen an animated series explore these themes. It attempts so much with what little it has.  It's not random at all... one little line has layers and layers of depth. I'll admit it's probably a bit hard to take at first (as any truly groundbreaking art is), but remember that it's just a show that makes fun of the dangers of spirituality. With that in mind, you should be able to see the beauty.  Personally, I think this is without question the most brilliant thing I've seen in forever, and I've fallen so hard in love for it that it's ridiculous.  I've actually TURNED ON MY TELEVISION lately, just to watch this show. Will most people like it? Probably not.

1268293,AMZCQIDUWDHLC,B002GSXKRO,John. N,"[1, 3]","Like most people, I have a love/hate relationship with Cartoon Network's Adult Swim. From shows that aggravatingly live on despite the fact they are terrible (Children's Hospital) to shows that deserve way more credit than they receive (Garth Marenghi's Darkplace) the revolving door and endless parade of programs makes one wonder how many times a network can try to recreate the success of Aqua Teen Hunger Force.I wasn't always a fan of ATHF. In the early going I thought a show with such an aimless plot was below me. But considering some of the trash TV I watch (Two and Half Men) I was merely fooling myself, the show eventually wearing down my defenses. I can't say I enjoy every episode, but I have to give credit where credit is due, that Aqua Teen Hunger Force pretty much forged the Adult Swim brand as we know it. So what does ATHF have to with Xavier: Renegade Angel? As one would expect given the audience it was created for, Xavier is an extension of the irreverent brand of Aqua Teen humor. The same could be about a show like Squidbillies; but where Squidbillies is nothing more than a carbon copy of a successful idea, the same can't be said of Renegade Angel.Xavier: Renegade Angel opens with the wayward Xavier (a humanoid creature whose body is composed from the parts of a handful of different creatures) wandering through the desert. More often than not, this setting is just an illusion, a metaphor for a wanderer that makes his way from town to town. Not soon after arriving at a given location, a problem presents itself to Xavier who tries to solve it with his inadvertently warped philosophy and self-serving delusions of grandeur. Noble intentions aside, Xavier's ""solutions"" usually backfire, doing more harm than good to the people around him. Blissfully unaware of the damage he's caused, he then rambles on to the next town where a similar yet altogether different series of events will play out once again.Oblivious as Xavier is about such consequences, there's more to his quest than enlightenment. Early on we learn that Xavier is looking for the person responsible for his father's murder. While it's obvious to the viewer who's to blame from the very first episode, the truth eludes Xavier until the spectacular season one finale. With this mystery ""solved,"" the plot shifts towards the peculiar relationship Xavier had with his mother. It's here where series becomes divided upon itself, as the streamlined focus of the first season disappears in favor of a free-for-all, anything goes approach. In doing this, the second season overloads what was a simple yet effective premise and leaves behind a mass of confusion. The show's greatest sin is when it tries to be more than TV show, a higher form of art and expression. Painful as this is to watch, such a scheme fails and the line between art and entertainment is eventually restored.The mess that is season two aside, I can't stay mad at Xavier. While the second disc of this set rarely meets the tray of my DVD player, the first season is unbelievable with it's crafty wordplay and is more than enough to make up for it. That said, for those who have yet to develop a taste for Adult Swim's type of humor, it's doubtful that Xavier: Renegade Angel will change their minds. For those into odd, off-beat shows however, Xavier may prove to be just the ticket.",4,A Tale of Two Xaviers,1312070400,"07 31, 2011",2011,3349,"['most', 'people', 'have', 'love/hate', 'relationship', 'Cartoon', 'Network', 'Adult', 'Swim', 'From', 'aggravatingly', 'live', 'fact', 'are', 'terrible', 'Children', 'Hospital', 'shows', 'deserve', 'way', 'more', 'credit', 'receive', 'Garth', 'Marenghi', 'Darkplace', 'revolving', 'door', 'endless', 'parade', 'programs', 'one', 'wonder', 'how', 'many', 'times', 'network', 'can', 'try', 'recreate', 'success', 'Aqua', 'Teen', 'Hunger', 'Force.I', 'was', ""n't"", 'always', 'fan', 'ATHF', 'early', 'going', 'thought', 'show', 'aimless', 'plot', 'was', 'considering', 'trash', 'TV', 'watch', 'Two', 'Half', 'Men', 'was', 'merely', 'fooling', 'show', 'eventually', 'wearing', 'down', 'defenses', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'enjoy', 'episode', 'have', 'give', 'credit', 'where', 'credit', 'due', 'Aqua', 'Teen', 'Hunger', 'Force', 'pretty', 'much', 'forged', 'Adult', 'Swim', 'brand', 'know', 'So', 'what', 'ATHF', 'have', 'Xavier', 'Renegade', 'Angel', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'given', 'audience', 'was', 'created', 'Xavier', 'extension', 'irreverent', 'brand', 'Aqua', 'Teen', 'humor', 'same', 'could', 'be', 'show', 'Squidbillies', 'where', 'Squidbillies', 'nothing', 'more', 'carbon', 'copy', 'successful', 'idea', 'same', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'said', 'Renegade', 'Angel.Xavier', 'Renegade', 'Angel', 'wayward', 'Xavier', 'humanoid', 'creature', 'body', 'composed', 'parts', 'handful', 'different', 'creatures', 'wandering', 'desert', 'More', 'often', 'not', 'setting', 'just', 'illusion', 'metaphor', 'wanderer', 'way', 'town', 'town', 'Not', 'soon', 'arriving', 'given', 'location', 'problem', 'Xavier', 'who', 'solve', 'inadvertently', 'warped', 'philosophy', 'self-serving', 'delusions', 'grandeur', 'Noble', 'intentions', 'aside', 'Xavier', 'solutions', 'usually', 'backfire', 'doing', 'more', 'harm', 'good', 'people', 'Blissfully', 'unaware', 'damage', 'caused', 'then', 'next', 'town', 'where', 'similar', 'yet', 'altogether', 'different', 'series', 'events', 'will', 'play', 'out', 'once', 'again.Oblivious', 'Xavier', 'such', 'consequences', 'more', 'quest', 'enlightenment', 'Early', 'learn', 'Xavier', 'looking', 'person', 'responsible', 'father', 'murder', 'obvious', 'viewer', 'who', 'blame', 'very', 'first', 'episode', 'truth', 'Xavier', 'spectacular', 'season', 'one', 'finale', 'mystery', 'solved', 'plot', 'shifts', 'peculiar', 'relationship', 'Xavier', 'had', 'mother', 'here', 'where', 'series', 'divided', 'streamlined', 'focus', 'first', 'season', 'disappears', 'favor', 'free-for-all', 'anything', 'approach', 'doing', 'second', 'season', 'overloads', 'what', 'was', 'simple', 'yet', 'effective', 'premise', 'mass', 'confusion', 'show', 'greatest', 'sin', 'when', 'be', 'more', 'TV', 'show', 'higher', 'form', 'art', 'expression', 'Painful', 'watch', 'scheme', 'line', 'art', 'entertainment', 'eventually', 'restored.The', 'mess', 'season', 'two', 'aside', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stay', 'mad', 'Xavier', 'second', 'disc', 'set', 'rarely', 'tray', 'DVD', 'player', 'first', 'season', 'unbelievable', 'crafty', 'wordplay', 'more', 'enough', 'make', 'up', 'said', 'who', 'have', 'yet', 'develop', 'taste', 'Adult', 'Swim', 'type', 'humor', 'doubtful', 'Xavier', 'Renegade', 'Angel', 'will', 'change', 'minds', 'odd', 'off-beat', 'shows', 'however', 'Xavier', 'may', 'prove', 'be', 'just', 'ticket']",N/A
1268294,A29HVOSR9VLFKP,B002GSXKRO,Mike  Silverman,"[1, 2]","Be careful.  Xavier ( Renegade Angel ) is definitely NOT for you if you have an easily offended sensibility. It is rife with sexual innuendo and off color language as well as some overtly violent moments. Xavier is a series about the wanderings ( from town to town ) of an oddly mutated man who appears to be made up of various animal parts. He is the acolyte of an Indian shaman and much of his world view appears to have been shaped in lessons learned from that man.  Not quite an ""anti-hero"" and not quite a hero either , Xavier is a supremely confused and misguided being who sees himself as the protector of the weak , and while sometimes he does manage to help people..., ""most"" of the time he causes more trouble by trying to help, than if he had simply left things alone.  He rambles.., truly rambles..., incessantly, on all manner of topics that he perceives as relevant to the situations he is in, but generally his thought process leads nowhere.  If you recall the great old television series Kung-Fu where David Carradine wandered through the old west as a Shaolin Priest seeking his brother,  Xavier is essentially a satire of that old TV show, and if you keep it in that context , Xavier is a very effective spoof of that old series.
