1444948,A3O6IY4UKCMQHG,B0057O6IIC,Hippolytos,"[0, 0]","SUMMARY: Elementary school teacher Anna Marchant survives an attack by a local serial killer, only to awake in the hospital, unable to recognize anyone's face, including her own. Diagnosed with prosopagnosia, or face blindness, she has to adapt to her condition, all while being targeted by person responsible for it.WHY YOU'LL LIKE IT: Jovovich is a good, though underrated, actress. She manages to impart Anna's confusion, frustration, terror, and helplessness to the audience with great skill. The storyline itself is very interesting. The serial killer angle aside, how would you cope when you're no longer able to recognize your closest friends and family?WHY YOU WON'T: Sloppy writing. From Anna's perfect life at the start of the movie, to the hackneyed, cliched ending, the film never seems to get off the ground, let alone live up to its premise. Anna's friends are caricatures, rather than actual characters. Anna's boyfriend treats her with little sympathy or compassion after her ordeal, which is clearly a plot device. The overuse of many actors performing a single character is ingenious at first, helping to communicate to the audience the pathos Anna is experiencing, but quickly becomes annoying, and even stupid, once the actors no longer bear resemblance to the characters' originators. Even more inexplicable is Anna's total inability to recognize VOICES, especially as it's fairly obvious that, though characters might be portrayed by many actors, a single voice is used. Julian McMahon is almost unrecognizable as the paunchy, gruff cop who is written so one-dimensionally that it's offensive. The identity of the culprit is apparent long before it's revealed. These are just the highlights. There are many other problems with the film.BOTTOM LINE: I really don't imagine this will appeal to those who are not highly enamored of Jovovich; there's not much else going for it.

1444955,A3S0IVFM83ZSE7,B0057O6IIC,P. Hardy,"[4, 4]","YOU EVER WATCH A MOVIE and expect to get a better bargain than your're usually dealt? I have and this is exactly what Faces in the Crowd encompasses. On the surface, the concept of using ""Face Blindness"" (an actual medical condition with a wholly narrative name) or Prosopagnosia as its officially dubbed, is very, very interesting and for the most part the movie does a fairly interesting job with its depiction.Story-line for the movie is simple as this:Milla Jovovich's character, Anna Merchant, is living the good life; she's got a loving boyfriend, stock quirky best friends who think about sex 99.9% of their time together (one of them is portrayed byPrison Break's Sarah Wayne Callies, who is, deliciously awkward in her devil-may-care position as a sour woman who's inability to catch a date is tied to her bitterness toward men for passing her over for her friend) and a great gig as a elementary school teacher (or pre-school teacher, I dunno). However, one single night manages to ruin all of this when she accidently catches a serial killer, dubbed ""Jearterk"", in the act of raping one of his victims. In an attempt to escape, she's tossed over a railing of a bridge by the killer and suffers serious head trauma. The accident, at first, seems to have just left her winded and concussed. However, when she takes a moment to took at loved ones around her, she realizes the accident has done far more damage than originally thought. Ana begins to suffer from a rare condition dubbed ""Face Blindness"" and the worse part of it is that she wouldn't be able to recognize the killer if he were right in front of her.For all the snark through Jovovich's way for being just a ""pretty face"" and a ""action girl"", Milla performs well in this movie. It's not a excellent performance (see:No Good Deed,.45orStonefor something special like that), but she gets the turmoil and anxiety of Anna's situation across perfectly; one particular scene literally had me worried she'd rip her own face off because of the frustration toward not being able to recognize herself in the mirror. The gimmick employed to empathize just how serious her condition is --- hiring actors that share some type of resemblance to Callies, SGI's Michael Shanks, and Valentina Vargas --- is pretty neat. It had me fooled for about a split second before I realized something was different about certain characters. However, as time goes, the shifting faces start to look less and less like the original counterpart and more like a completely different person. And the worst part of that is, when they decide to use it in the climax, it comes off like a really bad ""Who's the real Bob? Bob #1 or Bob #2?"" scene from a television show. I couldn't help but roll my eyes. Maybe that was the point, but it just smacked of laziness to me. There's also the question why she couldn't recognize anyone by their voices or their gestures unless she's that unfamiliar with her friends and family.Other performances were decent for the most part, nothing special, but nothing awful either. Julian McMahon as the tough-as-nails cop that eventually falls of Milla's character is neigh unrecognizable as a overweight cop with a goatee. It took the entirety of the movie for me to finally acknowledge the idea that it was him and not some random guy because I kept looking for a ""suave"" guy in a slick suit and a receding hairline. The chemistry between McMahon and Jovovich is non-existent, I never thought for a second that these two could fall in love with each other and as one of the glaring flaws in this movie, it just came off as a cop taking advantage of an emotionally compromised woman. The way they decide to use the fact that McMahon's character's face is the only one that never changes, via inserting a hackneyed reason to create a basis for a relationship, is just a bad cover up for the actual one (he's second highest paid actor in the movie next to Mllla and thus isn't about to get his screentime cut down by a character actor). Everything about their relationship smacked of a screenwriter running out of ideas for his/her characters and worse, working under the belief that its the required thing to do because, oh gosh, she can't recognize her boyfriend anymore! Guess that means they weren't so love in the first place, despite the fact that everything prior to her incident implied otherwise.Another incredibly laughable device used in the movie is the British Neurologist. She comes off as condescending to Anna's character, who goes to her for help for her condition, and worse becomes the apart of the Deus ex machina of the entire plot as it begins to unravel in its final act.To its credit, Faces works its audience with the gimmick of unrecognizable faces and changing characters to its very limits. However, the thing that kills is are the obvious tells that manifest in the form of Horoscopes, flashbacks through hypnotic suggestion, lingering shots on distorted/ruined children's drawing and characters simply staring at their reflections. If a particular character is intended to die, the original actor that portrayed them will appear in a reflection.The mere and constant implication that the serial killer is ""interested"" in Anna simply because she survived his attack literally gives away how the movie will end. They employ the presence of Julian McMahon in the same wayFlightplanused Sean Bean; you expect him to be the bad guy, but as the movie boils down, you steadily realize (if you didn't two scenes ago) it isn't him, the obvious perp is named and the killer you barely know anything about becomes a ranting, weeping, monologuing nut-case that's killed as a result of his own (or script induced) stupidity. And he spent the biggest chunk of the movie being the calm and composed best pal to the secondary protagonist, pretending to help a boy, the son of one of the serial rapists' victims.The biggest insult, in my opinion, is how the movie ends. Its a Lifetime ending born of confection sugar and a voice over that just makes the already stifled dialog that much worse. Overall, while Faces in the Crowd is not a horrible movie, it is by no means a good one either. The first half hour is watchable if only for its concept, but its ending is really what kills whatever hopes it had for being ""special"". Its an average thriller at best.

1444956,A387BD735MI50R,B0057O6IIC,R. Schultz,"[1, 1]","This is an average suspense story with some above-average medical insights. ""Faces in the Crowd"" illustrates what it feels like to be unable to remember faces, in the same way that the generally better movie ""Memento"" illustrated what it might feel like to have to cope with a complete loss of short-term memory.I was especially attracted to this DVD because it coincidentally tied in with my current reading of Oliver Sacks and V. S. Ramachandran. These authors delve into puzzling neurological problems that people develop after suffering head injury. One of the most unusual of these syndromes is ""prosopagnosia,"" the inability to recognize faces. This is the dangerous problem that the heroine of ""Faces"" has after she is attacked by a serial killer.Even though I'd read a lot of references to this condition, I had never before considered what having it would actually feel like, or what it would amount to in the daily life of a patient. Here it's shown as existence in a perpetual world of strangers whose faces subtly shape-shift every time the victim's attention is diverted.As a viewer, this often left me as disoriented as the movie's victim. Also, I was at first inclined to disagree with this interpretation of prosopagnosia. I had always just assumed that the condition would manifest itself as an inability to attach the persona, the role, of ""mother,"" ""father,"" or ""husband"" to the appropriate face in front of you. But as I got further involved with the movie, I realized I was thinking of another, possibly related, neurological condition known as ""Capgras' Syndrome,"" or, more popularly, as ""The Invasion of the Body Snatchers Syndrome."" With this condition, the sufferer experiences a continuity of identity of the people in her life, but maintains these people are imposters. ""That's not really my mother. That's only a clever simulacrum. She's so cold towards me, like a robot."" This condition though is deemed to be caused by some failure in the sufferer's centers of affect, rather than of memory. So that's another movie.I came to realize that this movie had probably gotten the feel of prosopagnosia right after all. The condition would have to involve a perception of even someone close to you, like a lover, as a series of digitally discrete and somewhat different faces.As clinically accurate as it might be, the movie does suffer from some logical lapses in its plot though. Wouldn't the heroine have been able to distinguish her boyfriend's voice from the killer's, even if their faces remained shifting enigmas? Why would her boyfriend have gotten so angry when he learned she didn't uniquely recognize him, and was using cues such as the color of his tie to recognize him moment-by-moment? It doesn't seem plausible that even the most cloddish of lovers would take that attitude. But the writers had to contrive the boyfriend's abandonment of his fianc&eacute; in order to leave her vulnerable to the approach of the killer.In general though, this movie is worth a watch. If you're looking for some suspense, if you can stand yet one more serial killer with an exotic signature, if you want to catch a view of the city of Winnipeg, and most of all, if you enjoy contemplating the workings of the human mind/brain - this is a film for you. I only wish there had been a commentary included. I'd like to have heard how the writer and director researched this very strange, revealing form of amnesia.",3,The Woman Who Mistook a Serial Killer for Her Boyfriend - or Vice Versa,1321056000,"11 12, 2011",2011,3429,"['average', 'suspense', 'story', 'above-average', 'medical', 'insights', 'Faces', 'Crowd', 'what', 'be', 'unable', 'remember', 'same', 'way', 'generally', 'better', 'movie', 'Memento', 'illustrated', 'what', 'might', 'feel', 'have', 'cope', 'complete', 'loss', 'short-term', 'memory.I', 'was', 'especially', 'attracted', 'DVD', 'coincidentally', 'tied', 'current', 'reading', 'Oliver', 'Sacks', 'V.', 'S.', 'Ramachandran', 'authors', 'delve', 'puzzling', 'neurological', 'problems', 'people', 'develop', 'suffering', 'head', 'injury', 'One', 'most', 'unusual', 'syndromes', 'prosopagnosia', 'inability', 'recognize', 'dangerous', 'problem', 'heroine', 'Faces', 'attacked', 'serial', 'killer.Even', ""'d"", 'read', 'lot', 'references', 'condition', 'had', 'never', 'before', 'considered', 'what', 'having', 'would', 'actually', 'feel', 'what', 'would', 'amount', 'daily', 'life', 'patient', 'Here', 'shown', 'existence', 'perpetual', 'world', 'strangers', 'subtly', 'shape-shift', 'time', 'victim', 'attention', 'diverted.As', 'viewer', 'often', 'as', 'disoriented', 'movie', 'victim', 'Also', 'was', 'first', 'inclined', 'disagree', 'interpretation', 'prosopagnosia', 'had', 'always', 'just', 'assumed', 'condition', 'would', 'manifest', 'inability', 'attach', 'persona', 'role', 'mother', 'father', 'husband', 'appropriate', 'face', 'front', 'got', 'further', 'involved', 'movie', 'realized', 'was', 'thinking', 'possibly', 'related', 'neurological', 'condition', 'known', 'Capgras', 'Syndrome', 'more', 'popularly', 'Invasion', 'Body', 'Snatchers', 'Syndrome', 'condition', 'sufferer', 'continuity', 'identity', 'people', 'life', 'people', 'are', 'imposters', 'not', 'really', 'mother', 'only', 'clever', 'simulacrum', 'so', 'cold', 'towards', 'robot', 'condition', 'deemed', 'be', 'caused', 'failure', 'sufferer', 'centers', 'affect', 'rather', 'memory', 'movie.I', 'came', 'realize', 'movie', 'had', 'probably', 'gotten', 'feel', 'prosopagnosia', 'right', 'condition', 'would', 'have', 'involve', 'perception', 'even', 'someone', 'close', 'lover', 'series', 'digitally', 'discrete', 'somewhat', 'different', 'faces.As', 'clinically', 'accurate', 'might', 'be', 'movie', 'suffer', 'logical', 'lapses', 'plot', 'Would', ""n't"", 'heroine', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'distinguish', 'boyfriend', 'voice', 'killer', 'even', 'remained', 'shifting', 'enigmas', 'Why', 'would', 'boyfriend', 'have', 'gotten', 'so', 'angry', 'when', 'learned', 'did', ""n't"", 'uniquely', 'recognize', 'was', 'using', 'cues', 'such', 'color', 'tie', 'recognize', 'moment-by-moment', ""n't"", 'seem', 'plausible', 'even', 'most', 'cloddish', 'lovers', 'would', 'take', 'attitude', 'writers', 'had', 'contrive', 'boyfriend', 'abandonment', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'order', 'leave', 'vulnerable', 'approach', 'killer.In', 'general', 'movie', 'watch', ""'re"", 'looking', 'suspense', 'can', 'stand', 'yet', 'one', 'more', 'serial', 'killer', 'exotic', 'signature', 'want', 'catch', 'view', 'city', 'Winnipeg', 'most', 'enjoy', 'contemplating', 'workings', 'human', 'mind/brain', 'film', 'only', 'wish', 'had', 'been', 'commentary', 'included', ""'d"", 'like', 'have', 'heard', 'how', 'writer', 'director', 'researched', 'very', 'strange', 'revealing', 'form', 'amnesia']",N/A

She teaches kindergarten, lives with Bryce, a man who is near popping the question, and hangs out with a crowd of women not much different than ""The Sex in the City"" gang. Her horoscope claims she will meet a mysterious stranger. Her kids draw pictures of faces- all omens of things to come. The background noise is about a serial killer and rapist (in that order). Milla bumps into the killer one night and manages to escape by falling off a bridge. The killer has her purse etc. and knows where she lives. The twist to this tale is that Milla has a nasty bump on the head and can't recognize faces, even those of her friends and family. Simple things such as waking up next to Byrce (12 different faces), looking at her Facebook, and teaching kindergarten become nightmares from hell. The police detective investigating the case is depicted as a street smart New Yorker, sometimes harsh in his mannerisms.Now to make things interesting, if not confusing, the film uses different actors (faces) for the same people to try to make us feel Milla's confusion. During this movie we get to learn that Marianne Faithfull is still alive and has been eating well.The film is a slow developing thriller. The confusion aspect makes the film a bit weird, but not more enjoyable. Milla does a good job in the role and demonstrates she is not a one-sided character. The script is unconvincing, and through all the twists and turns seems to lack the depth that is required to make it enjoyable.

Milla Jovovich plays an elementary school teacher Anna Marchant, who suddenly loses ability to recognize faces including her own. This means she has to rely on some other specific items to identify people around her. What is really terrifying is that she has just developed face blindness after witnessing a murder of a serial killer.There are thrillers with visually impaired heroines such as Audrey Hepburn's ""Wait Until Dark"" and more recently, ""Blink"" starring Madeleine Stowe. Unlike these films, ""Faces in the Crowd"" centers on a heroine who can see, but cannot recognize, faces including that of the murderer.It is an original idea, to be sure, but its execution needs much improvement. Writer / director Julien Magnat (""Bloody Mallory"") spends so much time trying to let viewers share the unsettling experience of the heroine with prosopagnosia.
