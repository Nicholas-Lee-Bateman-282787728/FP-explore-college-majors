Things don't go well and he winds-up drunk with a noose around his neck listening to loud music; before you can say ""clich&eacute;"" his mother opens the door to ask him to turn the music down . . . and accidentally kills him; but she knows where to find a hidden volume of occult lore in the basement of the local church . . .This is where the movie finally takes-off. Our protagonist doesn't know that he is a zombie and manages to fight off the urge to ""eat people"" for most of the movie. However, he winds-up accidentally taking a ""bite out of"" and contaminating the school bully who shows ""much"" less self-control. From there, the ""disease"" spreads across most of the student body and into the local town.All of our tired, clich&eacute;d, and overused high school stereotypes (dumb blonde, jock, mean girl, etc.) get turned into zombies and go on to attack others. The zombies in this movie are not your stereotypical ""Romero"" zombies. They are a little smarter, a lot stronger, and much faster than the zombie norm.

Unlike most other teen zombie flicks, this entry offers a dark and somber mood that refrains from falling in to self-parody.

It is a movie about zombies after all.  Its great how they are all mixed together at key times during the movies with the characters in peril or about to being eaten.  The comedy comes in and relieves the tension.  Its basically about a guy that witnesses what he believes his best friend (Samantha Mumba) out on the town with another guy.  Its a big deal for him because he sees what he believes is her ""helping"" the guy out in the car...even though that isnt what happens.So he goes and tries to hang himself in desparation while doing so his mom comes in and knocks something over thereby killing him.  It didnt look like he was actually going to go through with it.  But anyways his mom finds a voodoo book that has things about reanimation.  She steals it of course without knowing that something is missing in the book.  He wakes up and suddenly has no feeling, an insatiable thrist and of course a hunger for human flesh.  He bites the school's resident jerk while on football field after he seems him with his ""girl"".  I only say that way because she seems to not have a problem getting down with just about anyone.All hell breaks loose after that i could go on and everything.  But its better to witness the rest of the mayhem that ensues on your own.  Its worthy of nothing else at least a rent and after that i believe.

What VAMPIRES SUCK did for vampires, this movie does for zombies - only far better and with many more laughs and gore.The ""hero"" of the movie (played by David Leon, CLAPHAM JUNCTION, etc.) gets accidentally hanged by his mother opening his bedroom door while DL was standing on a chair and playing with a rope that originally was used to hang a stuffed animal in his room. The young man was depressed over what he thought was the sight of his girlfriend engaging in some sexual activity in the front seat of a fellow classmate's car (she was just being given a ride during a sudden downpour). The grieving mom -who works in a church and is aware of a particular spell book - brings her son back to life without telling him what she did. Shortly afterwards, the school bully attacks him and DL fights back by taking a bite out of his cheek. From then on, one bite leads to another; and before you can say ""zombie"" nearly everyone in the school has been ""turned"" and on a rampage (it almost looks like a microscopic version of WORLD WAR Z).DL somehow is able to hold off a final turn while the ever expanding zombie population attacks everyone it can. At the 11th hour, DL's girlfriend (portrayed by the exquisite and hip Samantha Mumba) climbs into a tree & shrub cutting vehicle and mows down 99% of the zombies faster than you can say ""zombie"". This is the highlight of the film that is both hilarious and gory in the extreme.Blood is even used as windshield wiping material. The cartoonish aspects tone down the gore so that it hardly fits into the same category as SAW or CHAINSAW MASSACRE. And, after all, this movie is meant to be a parody.In the meantime, DL's mother is able to find a way to reverse what she did - and a surprise ""double type"" of ending (no spoilers here) leads to a satisfying conclusion. This DVD is highly recommended for those willing to accept it for what it is and meet it on its own terms.

First, the type of zombie: the first zombie is a voodoo zombie but, that soon turns into infected-by-bite zombies.Plot: Boy likes girl, boy mistakenly thinks girl is hooking up with another boy and boy becomes all frustrated and dies by a freak kind-of-death. Mom revives boy in voodoo ritual and boy becomes a zombie. But, this guy still has his mental faculties intact; a new kind of zombie indeed. Can he resist enough to not eat the girl he likes? The movie is good because it is entertaining. Plus, it has lots of top grade impressive gore (involving heavy machinery!) and has a decent storyline.

His mum proceeds to bring him back from the dead via voodoo magic, and it isn't long before Nathan starts craving human flesh, and zombies run amok (literally, these are the running variety here).

1108927,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B000WEVGGQ,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[1, 1]","Boy Eats Girl (Stephen Bradley, 2005)I have watched a lot of unconscionably bad horror movies over the past week, and that may have something to do with why I was so taken with Boy Eats Girl, a silly, fun Irish zombedy from screenwriter Derek Landy, who's currently working on bringing the mega-popular Skullduggery Pleasant books to the silver screen. Sure, it has its flaws, but compared to some of the junk I had the misfortune of seeing this week, it's Oscar material. It put me in mind of such classics of stupidity as Night of the Creeps and Beware! The Blob, and I say that with all the affection it sounds like.Nathan (RocknRolla's David Leon) is an Irish schoolboy with a mad crush on his childhood friend Jessica (Irish pop sensation Samantha Mumba). The night he plans to declare his love for her, egged on by his two lunkheaded friends, a series of badly-interpreted encounters leads Nathan to kill himself instead. Nathan's mother, who's been working on the renovation of a local church, happened to discover an ancient book in the crypt with the power to bring the dead back to life, and so Nathan wakes up the next day very thirsty and with an odd paleness to his skin. Other than that, though, life in high school is no different. Until, that is, the school bully angers Nathan, who ends up not only throwing him halfway across a football field, but chowing down on his insides...We should probably state right off that Boy Eats Girl is not a horror film, in case you didn't pick that up from the title. This is a high school angst comedy that happens to feature zombies. (The more recent American equivalent, Dance of the Dead, was one of the best American films of 2008.) And that's what makes Boy Eats Girl such an enjoyable excursion; it never really tries to be a horror movie. It knows its limitatons, and it plays to them. Think of it as 10 Things I Hate About You with a dead Patrick. Oh, wait, that's tasteless.

Unfortunately, the cover is the only interesting thing about Boy Eats Girl. This was a low budget, independent film, made in Ireland, and boy does it show. The story centers around teenage Nathan, played by a much older guy, who is having girl problems. Nathan is all worried about his female trouble, when he has a fatal accident, or at least one that should be fatal. His mom, not wanting to let go of her son, uses an ancient book on voodoo to bring her son back. The story was very typical for this kind of film, however the budget was so low that parts of it looked like an episode of Goosebumps. Technical I suppose the movie is still considered rated R because of gore, even when the blood looks like V8 juice, but this film is anything but scary.

I enjoyed this one a lot. Along with ""Night of the Living Dorks,"" teen angst & zombies seem to go along pretty good.1) The actors could act. Other than a few of the actors who little a little long in the tooth to be playing high school kids, everything was fine.2) It was nice to see a zombie infestation resulting from a voodoo incident, instead of from outer space or some chemical or viral infection.3) The plot was good, and didn't stray hardly at all with sub-plots involving secondary characters, unless it tied into the main storyline. Grace is working at a catholic church, cleaning and rehabbing much of the insides and catacombs in the basement levels. She finds the book by accident, and then later when she needs it, she sneaks it out of the church.4) The blood and gore was plentiful. People are getting killed & eaten left and right on screen for all your gratuitous pleasure. During the blood drenched finale, a character ends up driving what I will call a ""tree / wood chipper on wheels"" and to fight off the attacking zombie mob, she drives right into it. Many a leg and arm are sent flying as the zombies are pretty much ""chewed up and spit out.""5) The zombies in this flick are ""Snyder Runners."" They don't stalk or shamble, they just run to attack their next victim.6) The cure, the cure, the cure. There really aren't a lot of zombie flicks where a zombie can be cured after turning. Nathan, the zombie / hero lead whose well-intentioned mom brought back from the dead, is cured of his condition. A few times in the movie, he gave in to his carnal urges and killed and ate a few people. I would've thought after that, there would be no turning back, but I guess not. When his mom returns the book to the church, she is attacked in the crypt by the (now turned) zombie priest. After a brief struggle, she grabs a snake that was in the crypt and has it bite the attacking priest. As the poison enters the priest's bloodstream, the priest is no longer a zombie. So mom goes off with snake in hand, to find Nathan. Will she find Nathan in time? Or will she get attacked by the zombies?Overall, this was a good fun flick. Nothing really new, other than the snake bite, is brought to the genre. This movie was described as ""Shaun of the Dead"" meets ""American Pie."" I think that is a pretty good description of this flick. There was hardly anything to really complain about other than the shortness of the movie (77 minutes), and I would recommend this movie for all to see.RATING: 4 out of 5",4,A review from Zombiefans!,1193961600,"11 2, 2007",2007,2624,"['typical', 'teen', 'boy', 'meets', 'girl', 'boy', 'girl', 'boy', 'girl', 'back', 'movie', 'nice', 'mix', 'zombie', 'fun', 'thrown', 'enjoyed', 'one', 'lot', 'Night', 'Living', 'Dorks', 'teen', 'angst', 'zombies', 'seem', 'go', 'along', 'pretty', 'good.1', 'actors', 'could', 'act', 'Other', 'few', 'actors', 'who', 'little', 'little', 'long', 'tooth', 'be', 'playing', 'high', 'school', 'kids', 'everything', 'was', 'fine.2', 'was', 'nice', 'see', 'zombie', 'infestation', 'resulting', 'voodoo', 'incident', 'instead', 'outer', 'space', 'chemical', 'viral', 'infection.3', 'plot', 'was', 'good', 'did', ""n't"", 'stray', 'hardly', 'sub-plots', 'involving', 'secondary', 'characters', 'tied', 'main', 'storyline', 'Grace', 'working', 'catholic', 'church', 'cleaning', 'rehabbing', 'much', 'insides', 'catacombs', 'basement', 'levels', 'book', 'accident', 'then', 'later', 'when', 'sneaks', 'church.4', 'blood', 'gore', 'was', 'plentiful', 'People', 'are', 'getting', 'killed', 'eaten', 'left', 'right', 'screen', 'gratuitous', 'pleasure', 'blood', 'drenched', 'finale', 'character', 'up', 'driving', 'what', 'will', 'call', 'tree', '/', 'wood', 'chipper', 'wheels', 'fight', 'off', 'attacking', 'zombie', 'mob', 'right', 'leg', 'arm', 'are', 'sent', 'flying', 'zombies', 'are', 'pretty', 'much', 'chewed', 'up', 'spit', 'out', '5', 'zombies', 'flick', 'are', 'Snyder', 'Runners', 'do', ""n't"", 'stalk', 'shamble', 'just', 'run', 'attack', 'next', 'victim.6', 'cure', 'cure', 'cure', 'really', 'are', ""n't"", 'lot', 'zombie', 'flicks', 'where', 'zombie', 'can', 'be', 'cured', 'turning', 'Nathan', 'zombie', '/', 'hero', 'lead', 'well-intentioned', 'mom', 'brought', 'back', 'dead', 'cured', 'condition', 'few', 'times', 'movie', 'gave', 'carnal', 'urges', 'killed', 'ate', 'few', 'people', 'would', ""'ve"", 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'turning', 'back', 'guess', 'not', 'When', 'mom', 'book', 'church', 'attacked', 'crypt', 'now', 'turned', 'zombie', 'priest', 'brief', 'struggle', 'grabs', 'snake', 'was', 'crypt', 'bite', 'attacking', 'priest', 'poison', 'priest', 'bloodstream', 'priest', 'no', 'longer', 'zombie', 'So', 'mom', 'snake', 'hand', 'find', 'Nathan', 'Will', 'find', 'Nathan', 'time', 'will', 'get', 'attacked', 'zombies', 'Overall', 'was', 'good', 'fun', 'flick', 'Nothing', 'really', 'new', 'other', 'snake', 'bite', 'brought', 'genre', 'movie', 'was', 'described', 'Shaun', 'Dead', 'American', 'Pie', 'think', 'pretty', 'good', 'description', 'flick', 'was', 'hardly', 'anything', 'really', 'complain', 'other', 'shortness', 'movie', '77', 'minutes', 'would', 'recommend', 'movie', 'see.RATING', '4', '5']",N/A
