There is a nice cross section of characters.  The first couple of episodes included workers with fake names (in my day, &#34;Frenchy&#34; was the popular one we joked about which gave it some credibility.  It is at times suspenseful (will the act be cut--can they do those catches?) to keep it from being mundane.",4,Circus reality,1400284800,"05 17, 2014",2014,412,"['interesting', 'look', 'small', 'wholesome', 'circus', 'Not', 'interesting', 'enough', 'binge', 'watch', 'nice', 'cross', 'section', 'characters', 'first', 'couple', 'episodes', 'included', 'workers', 'fake', 'names', 'day', '34', 'Frenchy', '34', 'was', 'popular', 'one', 'joked', 'gave', 'credibility', 'times', 'suspenseful', 'will', 'act', 'be', 'cut', 'can', 'do', 'catches', 'keep', 'being', 'mundane']",Circus

Too bad they don't let the show run a couple of years.  They let the clown (dancing in the rain) and the clown who led the orchestra with children go. I hope they have found other jobs. Grandma is still there, and (s)he's a staple of The Big Apple Circus.  So much fun and talent!  I was interested to see how the people behind the scenes live, too.  The workers have a pitiful life that they make for themselves.  The show gives them lodging and food and a small salary.  Two of the women struck me as being very intelligent except in their choice of men.

This program devotes almost equal time to the crew and creative team as it does to the performers, and the program is that much more well-rounded and informative because of it.This program examines circus life both for its glamour and for its warts.  It truly is a unique lifestyle for everyone involved and it makes them a VERY tight-knit family.  Most of us should be so lucky as to have a family like this.Highly recommended program.  I watched all six episodes (running a total of just over 5.5 hours) in one sitting.

1366743,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B003V6L8U6,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[1, 1]","Produced and televised originally on PBS stations, ""Circus"" is an all-encompassing six part documentary that takes you behind the scenes of the famed ""Big Apple Circus."" From rehearsals to the end of the season, this exhaustive documentary really puts you into the hearts and minds of the individuals dedicating their lives to the show. While I can't say that I'm a huge circus fan, I did find ""Circus"" to be a highly entertaining piece. More concerned with the personalities that populate the circus community, ""Circus"" is far more interested in exposing the drama ""in the life"" than ""under the big top."" In other words, while you do see plenty of awesome acts, most of the film takes place outside of the staged performances.The film starts in training and rehearsals, and the first two episodes are arguably its strongest. Introducing the acts and the backstage personnel, we get an intimate look at both the creative and practical challenges that face such a huge endeavor. The colorful cast includes a struggling first year clown, estranged identical twin brother jugglers, a trapeze act that may not make it, a roadie taken off for creating a bomb scare, a high wire artiste whose act may be too urbane, a circus institution battling cancer, and a new guest creative director. We also meet the founders and see the stewardship of the circus transfer hands. There are lots of stories going on--unexpected firings, romance in laborer ranks, injuries and insecurities. ""Circus"" makes an interesting microcosm of society on the fringes and works well making the viewers understand and care about its inhabitants.Ultimately, I feel the momentum does wane a bit in the final three episodes. There is less inherent drama once the circus is established and on the road. But I did like the humanizing touches, especially as the season winds down leaving the fate of many of the performers open ended. Perhaps the most successful element at the end is to see one circus kid graduate the trailer school with his high school diploma to set out for college. The circus life is messy and often times you are born to it--in fact, those choosing it are often seen as outsiders by those whose families have been in the act for generations. I was entertained by ""Circus"" and enjoyed it immensely. If you have an interest in the circus, this recommendation is a no-brainer. But I'd say this is good stuff for anyone that likes real human interest material as well.
