1014690,AE5A9FB765HMF,B000HEZETQ,gex144,"[0, 0]","I first watched this series when G4 was known as G4 Tech Tv, and had an anime section, and wasn't lame.  The show seemed pretty cool, even though I didn't understand everything.I watch the whole series again a 2nd time through a couple years later.  Pretty much had the same reaction, except that I understood it a little more.Recently, I decided to give the Boogiepop Phantom DVD Thinpak Collection (2000) a purchase.  I chose that version of the DVD collection for 2 reasons.  1, it has a live action movie that is a prequel to the series, so I figured it would fill me in on details that are tough or impossible to catch in the anime.  2, English commentary on the episodes.But then I decided to go a step further.  I purchased 2 of the light novels.  Boogiepop and Others (the first light novel written I believe, and is the novel that the movie is based on [obviously, since it has the same title]), and Boogiepop at Dawn.  I read both of those novels first before re-watching the series (starting with Boogiepop and Others), and I have to say, both of them are mandatory.  They give you background on so much stuff in the anime.  In fact, while watching the series again, I realized that the anime kind of assumes the viewer has already read these novels.  They're worth a read, and they won't take long to finish.  They are ""light"" novels after all.So after all that, I first tried to watch the live action adaptation of Boogiepop and Others.  In a nutshell, it's bad.  I couldn't bring myself to watch the whole thing after seeing how much they butcher the novel (okay, they didn't exactly butcher it, but they could've done a hell of a lot better, even with the low budget).There were only 2 things I liked about what I managed to watch from the movie.  1, the Warning label that comes up at the beginning of every movie, that says you will be sued up the @$$ and imprisoned if you make copies of the video and put it online.  What they do with this is so freaking brilliant and hilarious, I wonder why no slasher movies have done the same thing.  They have the warning copyright notice as usual, but instead of a blank background screen, they show 3 dead students in the background.  It took me a moment to consider the implications of this [don't make bootlegs, or this will be your fate], and once that moment passed, I was laughing for 5 minutes straight .  Anyway, the 2nd thing I liked was the Manticore (or just a regular schoolgirl since they couldn't afford make-up effects, not that they would need much for this) at the beginning of the film.  She is sitting over a dead(?) girl, and licks her eyeball while her eyelids are open.  Since this movie is low budget to the point of being unable to afford decent makeup effects or costumes (the Boogiepop outfit is a joke; seriously, it made me laugh), I'm pretty sure this wasn't a prop.  These were two real actresses in the scene, one of them having nerves of steel to keep her eye open, and the other not managing to gag while licking her eyeball.  That sequence is gag-worthy, unsettling, a little creepy, and great.  Props to the one who got her eye licked.  I don't know how she was able to keep her eye open and not flinch during that whole sequence, but she did it.And that's it, those are the only 2 reasons to watch the first 10-15 minutes of the live action film.  It gets too boring to bear watching the rest, so I fast-forwarded to the finale sequence, and it's just as irritating as the rest of the film, seeing what they changed.  They didn't exactly change anything that affects the plot in a major way, but if you see it after reading the light novel, you will be asking ""Why?"" the whole time you're watching the movie.As for the anime, it got a whole lot better having knowledge gained from the 2 light novels.  This show doesn't hold your hand.  It expects the viewers to be of decent intelligence, and expects their full attention and focus while watching each episode, like Serial Experiments Lain except that this show rewards your dedication and gets better with each viewing.The first two episodes let you know exactly what you're getting into, and will immediately let you know if this is the show for you, or not.  The strange blurred style, the unique music, the mystery, the fact that you will come to know other characters that you only catch a glimpse of in previous episodes, and the supernatural things that happen.  I would recommend watching the first 2 episodes, and if it seems interesting to you at all in anyway, and you want to watch the rest of the series, read the 2 light novels first, then watch the series.  Trust me, you will be glad you did.  That said, so long as you really pay attention, you can enjoy the series for what it is without reading the novels.People have compared this show to Lain.  I'll admit, the comparisons aren't without warrant.  Both are weird in their own way, and both demand your attention and thinking caps.  But I would also compare this show to The Wire.  I only make that comparison with the knowledge gained from the 2 novels.  Here's why.  By the end of the series, in the final moments of the final episode, it gets pretty emotional.  Why?  Because it's like the last page of a big novel has just been turned, and it's over.  It's the end of it all.  It's bittersweet, not everyone gets what they wanted, some turn out better than others.  But in the end, it's goodbye.  It's the end of an important time in the lives of the characters we come to know from the novels and at points in the anime.  They all know this is the end of their youth, and they have to say goodbye to each other, and to the lives they had.  It's a feeling you can only get if you've come to know the characters through the novels, which increases the emotional impact of the final moments of the last episode by ten-fold.  Let me put it this way, without reading the novels, it's like watching Kingdom of Heaven.  With the novels, it's Kingdom of Heaven The Director's Cut.Oh yeah, and the commentary.  Man, these English guys who worked on getting this anime stateside, we couldn't have gotten it from a better group.  These guys are passionate about this anime.  Just listening to the commentary on some of the episodes, seeing their notes on the Bonus Feature on the final dvd disc.  Whichever version of the anime set you get, make sure it has the English Producers commentary on it.  The only thing that would make the set any more perfect is if it came with the 2 light novels (especially if they replace the live-action movie).I recommend this series, big time.",5,How to properly

The animation is decent and for the series fitting as the show is very dark and supernatural but there is a little graininess in some scenes, also while the Japanese cast did great with their roles sadly with the exception of about four voice actors/actresses the English dub cast were terrible, saying their lines with so little emotional feelings you wonder why they tried for these roles in the first place if they were just going to do a atrocious job of it.  The live action movie is pretty decent to but they didn't do any dubbing for the live action movie and I truly appreciate that especially if they were going to use the same actors and actresses from the series.

1014693,A2A8PN3Q5QVNR6,B000HEZETQ,Suzanne,"[35, 36]","OVERVIEW:What is contained in this Thinpak set is the entire series of Boogiepop Phantom (BP) - 12 episodes on 4 DVDs - and the live-action film ""Boogiepop and Others / Boogiepop Doesn't Smile"" (BaO). In Japan, Boogiepop was spawned as a series of young adult novels. BaO was the first novel released in the Boogiepop series, and the film is an adaptation of it. Therefor it is a prequel to BP. I originally watched the series first, but the 2nd time I watched the film then series. Watching BaO first is likely preferable, as it details the events that the BP is centered around. To watch BP with no knowledge of BaO can be even more confusing than it already is.BOOGIEPOP AND OTHERS / BOOGIEPOP DOESN'T SMILE7 / 10The film, like the series, tells multiple stories that intertwine concerning a central theme. Specifically, there's 4 stories that revolve around the appearance of a monster known as the manticore, a strange man known as Echoes, and Boogiepop herself. Boogiepop is a Shinigami, or the Japanese equivalent of Death. Boogiepop manifests as an alternate personality to an individual when dangers appear that threaten our world.This film is relatively low budget. You could call it the equivalent of a B-Movie. The special effects and action scenes are more laughable than anything, and the sound and music has a very un-professional feel. That said, it's surprisingly enjoyable. The cheesiness is kept to a minimum as the focus remains on the characters. Don't go into this expecting Hitchcock-like film mastery and it shouldn't be too hard to enjoy. The young cast is the highlight. I especially liked Boogiepop herself and Nagi Kirima. The vision it paints of Japan is actually a nice one, especially the shots of Boogiepop on top of the buildings at sunset. I also find the pacing here well done. Each story has its own flow, but at the same time It feels like a steady progression towards the conclusion. Many animes could actually learn a lesson about pace, rhythm, and timing from this flash-less film.The extras are nice and really extensive. They are perhaps better than the film itself (which can be taken as a good or bad thing). I especially enjoyed the ""making of"" featurette, as it appears the entire cast had a blast making the film. They include:*History of Boogiepop*Director's Commentary*Storyboards*Boogiepop in Yubari*Premier Featurette*Making of Boogiepop Featurette*Cast and Staff Bios*TrailersOverall, this is a quality adaptation of the novel if one doesn't judge it on too harsh of standards. I'm happy it's included as it's really helpful in understanding the Boogiepop universe before venturing into the difficult BP.BOOGIEPOP PHANTOM8 / 10This series centers around the events at the end of B&O;, and its lingering effects. The ""pillar of light"" that was seen in that night's sky gives multiple people strange abilities. With it came a rainbow-like haze that lingers over the city. An evil creature is lurking among the population and teenagers are disappearing. Boogiepop appears out of the form of Toka Miyashita to hunt down the unleashed evil along with Nagi Kirima. Even more mysterious is the appearance of Phantoms - echoes of beings that already exist. One such is a Phantom of Boogiepop. Rumors swirl of an organization behind the creation of beings known as composite humans. Memories of haunted pasts plague the people of the city, including a serial killer that stalked the city 5 years ago. What does all of this mean for the students of two local schools including Shinyo Academy?This is as bizarre an anime as there is. It has a Lain-like feel with its dark, mysterious tone. While Lain is more abstract and psychedelic, BP more direct and tangible - but don't confuse this with simplicity. BP's narrative is one of the most complex you'll see in anime. Like the film, it tells multiple stories in a fractured narrative - that never relies on linearity - that revolves around a central idea. These stories intertwine with others so you'll see glimpses of one within another from different points of views. Due to the wealth of stories, the cast is extremely large. It can be very confusing to keep up with characters, which makes remembering those who appear more than once difficult. However, BP is able to keep the focus on (a) central character(s) at a time, which prevents it from becoming an incomprehensible mess. The most difficult aspect is determining where in the chronological context each story and scene fits, but that's also part of the fun.To say the animation in BP is ""unique"" is an understatement. The entire series (save one episode) is told with a vignette effect - a black circle around its edges. Along with it, is a drab and incredibly limited color palette. You'll mostly see shades of brown, black, and white. This presentation is done on purpose, partly to create a hazy dream world and a stark contrast with the finale. Where Lain relied on dark/light themes with bright colors to create a psychedelic, disconnected tone, BP uses its own brand of minimalism to create a similar one. A blurry haze is common throughout and some scenes are so dark as to make it nearly impossible to tell what's happening. Viewers will either love or hate this style. While I really don't care for it, it is completely unique and quite effective. Such minimal animation and color means that there isn't much beauty to be found in the visuals. But the trade-off is the superb atmosphere it creates.The music is perhaps a weak point as there's very little of it. However, I really enjoy both the opening (especially) and ending themes. The sound, however, is the focus. Multiple effects are used to create eerie sounds which work extremely well within the context of the visuals. The acting is well done (in the sub), if perhaps unspectacular. The dialogue can get a bit windy at times, and some of the themes are trite and shallow - ""Why am I alive? We all just die anyway."" for example. But it's the stories, tone, and narrative that sucks you in. There's something extremely hypnotic about BP that I can't quite put my finger on. It's not so much that I enjoy the series itself as I enjoy being involved in the dream it creates. It's been called a ""horror"", but it's not scary or frightening in the traditional sense. I really think BP defies genre tags as I'm not sure what to label it at all.This is a series like Lain that viewers will likely either love or hate. Much like Lain I found it as equally frustrating as it was intriguing. The complex narrative and atmosphere the series creates is undoubtedly the highlights. I feel that BP resolves itself a bit better than Lain did, with superior pacing and narrative design. However, I preferred Lain's animation and depth of themes that it weaved into the story. I think I'd put the two on about equal ground, and which you prefer would be entirely personal. I think I slightly prefer Boogiepop Phantom as I found myself understanding it better on the 2nd viewing, where much of Lain seems opaque for the sake of being obfuscatory.The extras are minimal. There is director's commentary and some music videos. But the best is the Production and Character notes on Disc 4. This details the many characters in BP and even provides a bit of an aid for those who don't know about the Boogiepop universe.Overall, this is one of the truly unique works in the world of Anime. Its originality alone is a quality making it worth your time. In a world where most of anime has become stagnant, I thoroughly appreciate works like this that break the mold and stand out from all the banal imitations.",4,The City of Haunted
