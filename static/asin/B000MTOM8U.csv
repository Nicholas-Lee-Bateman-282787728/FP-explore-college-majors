Fans of the show will be pleased with the DVD release of the first season.  The season one DVD includes the first 13 episodes of the show.  The downside is that season one aired so long ago these episodes seem like light years ago.  It would have been good if they would have released the first and second season together on DVD.The first season chronicles Jude's semi rise to stardom. After winning the Instant Star competition she receives a record contract with G Major Records.  Her producer is ""Little Tommy Q,"" who used to be in a boy band named Boyz Attack.  Tommy is all grown up now and he is her producer who she has a crush on it seems.  Adding to the story is her close relationship with her male childhood best friend Jamie.  At this time in the series, Jude is still in high school and living with her parents who are still married.  Her sister Sadie is a little older than her but they attend the same school.The first season is primarily about her recording songs for G Major and dealing with various unexpected trappings of sudden fame. First she has conflict with a fellow recording artist named Eden.  Then she finds love with a rapper named Shay.  Things really heat up when her and her producer Tommy share an unexpected kiss on Jude's 16th birthday.  It's all not a smooth ride as she also has to deal with her parents crumbling marriage.Instant Star is a television series packed with drama. It's a series that teens and adults will find intriguing and it was created by the same people who created the series Degrassi The Next Generation.  Bonus features includes deleted scenes, bloopers, cast auditions, music performances and more.",5,Great DVD Release,1185667200,"07 29, 2007",2007,1726,"['Instant', 'Star', 'been', 'popular', 'teen', 'past', 'few', 'seasons', 'Fans', 'show', 'will', 'be', 'pleased', 'DVD', 'release', 'first', 'season', 'season', 'one', 'DVD', 'first', '13', 'episodes', 'show', 'downside', 'season', 'one', 'aired', 'so', 'long', 'episodes', 'seem', 'light', 'years', 'ago', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'good', 'would', 'have', 'released', 'first', 'second', 'season', 'together', 'DVD.The', 'first', 'season', 'chronicles', 'Jude', 'semi', 'rise', 'stardom', 'winning', 'Instant', 'Star', 'competition', 'record', 'contract', 'G', 'Major', 'Records', 'producer', 'Little', 'Tommy', 'Q', 'who', 'used', 'be', 'boy', 'band', 'named', 'Boyz', 'Attack', 'Tommy', 'grown', 'up', 'now', 'producer', 'who', 'crush', 'Adding', 'story', 'close', 'relationship', 'male', 'childhood', 'best', 'friend', 'Jamie', 'time', 'series', 'Jude', 'still', 'high', 'school', 'living', 'parents', 'who', 'are', 'still', 'married', 'sister', 'Sadie', 'little', 'older', 'attend', 'same', 'school.The', 'first', 'season', 'primarily', 'recording', 'songs', 'G', 'Major', 'dealing', 'various', 'unexpected', 'trappings', 'sudden', 'fame', 'First', 'conflict', 'fellow', 'recording', 'artist', 'named', 'Eden', 'Then', 'love', 'rapper', 'named', 'Shay', 'Things', 'really', 'heat', 'up', 'when', 'producer', 'Tommy', 'share', 'unexpected', 'kiss', 'Jude', '16th', 'birthday', 'not', 'smooth', 'ride', 'also', 'deal', 'parents', 'crumbling', 'marriage.Instant', 'Star', 'television', 'series', 'packed', 'drama', 'series', 'adults', 'will', 'find', 'intriguing', 'was', 'created', 'same', 'people', 'who', 'created', 'series', 'Degrassi', 'Next', 'Generation', 'Bonus', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'bloopers', 'cast', 'auditions', 'music', 'performances', 'more']",Instant Star: Season 1

If you haven't seen it, it is about a girl who wins an american idol like talent contest and has to learn to deal with the pit falls of fame. The extra's include deleted scenes, bloopers, some of the musical performances from the season, and the auditions of the actors who play Tommy, Jamie, and our leading lady Jude.

I love the Instant Star soundtracks! Alexz Johnson has such a great voice! Hopefully the rest of the seasons will follow this one to DVD.
