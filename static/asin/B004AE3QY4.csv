1393299,A1ZOF747O5EB6R,B004AE3QY4,Andrew Desmond,"[1, 1]","""Rabbit Hole"" is an excellent film.  It covers the lives of Becca and Howie (Nicole Kidman and Aaron Eckhart) and how they deal with the tragic loss of their four year old son who was killed in a tragic accident.  The little boy was chasing his dog into the street when he was struck down by car.  Every parent's nightmare.The film is searingly emotional at times.  What film about such a topic could be otherwise?  The marriage of Becca and Howie is straining to its limits.  They simply cannot come to grips with a world without their son.  They briefly try group therapy but Becca is cynical and only becomes more so when people invoke God and his supposed plan.  Another couple explain their loss as ""God needed another angel.""  Becca snaps back: ""Then why wouldn't he have just made another angel? He's God, after all. Why not just make another angel?""  Becca leaves the group and doesn't return.As the film progresses, it seems that couple are bound to separate.  Yet, somehow, they draw back from the precipice.  Perhaps they peer of the edge and don't like what they see?  In the end, they begin the road to a renewed existence.Yet, this is not a film with an obvious happy ending.

1393300,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B004AE3QY4,Andrew Ellington,"[8, 8]","Talk about a film that guts me (emotionally) like a fish; `Rabbit Hole' is a brutally honest look at loss and grief and the constant struggle to find a sense of normalcy once life isn't normal anymore.  Watching the film once is surely enough (very few films are this depressing), but watching it once is a definite must.  There are few films that really understand such a complex subject as well as `Rabbit Hole'.  While I've never lost a child, I have two of them and so I understand deeply a parents love for that small being you want so much to protect from everything and everyone.But you can't always do that.`Rabbit Hole' picks up eight months after the death of four-year-old Danny.  His parents, Becca and Howie, are struggling to pick up the broken pieces of their lives.  Becca became reclusive and self-absorbed, cutting off everyone around her in an attempt to internalize her pain.  Howie tries to carry on with his life, acting as if nothing is bothering him and yet he sections himself off late at night and watches the same video on his phone over and over.  Becca tries to rid herself of her son's memory; from his clothes to his toys to the fingerprint smudges on the door hinges.  Howie wants to strengthen that memory; going as far as to keep his son's car-seat in his car as a way of holding onto what he's lost.  Becca resents the advice and comforts from others, especially her mother, because comforts and advice cannot replace the hole in her heart.  Howie thrives off other's experiences, finding a doorway to `answers' that help make his grief more tolerable.In other words; Becca and Howie are grieving in drastically different ways.`Rabbit Hole' gives us a snapshot of the lives of Becca and Howie and uncovers how they cope and eventually come to terms and move on, while learning once again how to rely on one another.  When tragedy strikes it is easy to take things out on those closest to you, and when you are both hurting so severely it becomes a bigger struggle because we expect so much out of the other person.  Howie knows that he has to be this rock of encouragement and yet who is he supposed to cry on?  The same can be said for Becca, who feels as though she has had her world ripped out from under her and yet she still has to contend with the needs of her husband, not to mention her mother and newly pregnant sister.  Life goes on, even when we want it to stop, and that is a hard lesson to learn.Nicole Kidman is sensational here.  She layers Becca effortlessly, truly sinking herself into this character.  This is such a complex character because you need to be able to convey more than pain and suffering in order to make the character feel real and invested and relatable and she sells every moment, lacing her pain with a sense of wanting; and the scenes with Miles Teller are truly remarkable.  Speaking of Miles Teller, he is just beautifully sincere here.  Those tears running down his cheek kill me.  Aaron Eckhart takes a backseat to Nicole Kidman, but he doesn't phone anything in or rely on her to carry to film.  He doesn't have the showiest performance in the film, but he knows how to elicit genuine emotions that complement the approach Nicole was taking.  Dianne Wiest is always a welcomed force, and she proves once again that she is far more than just a sublime comedic actress; she is also a sublime dramatic one.Aside from the acting, this film soars on a technical level as well; boasting a beautifully controlled score and some richly intriguing framing choices that elevated the film and gave it such an otherworldly feel, capturing the emotional purgatory of the key characters.`Rabbit Hole' is unapologetically depressing.  Thank god for that pot smoking scene, which helped cut the film's thickly layered grief with a short-lived yet much needed comedic moment.  That said; there really is no other way to tell this kind of story, so bravo on all involved for `going there'.  The film ends with a glimmer of hope, proof that you can get back on track no matter how difficult it is to do so.Without doubt, one of the best films of 2010!",5,Head first...,1304985600,"05 10, 2011",2011,4109,"['Talk', 'film', 'emotionally', 'fish', 'Rabbit', 'Hole', 'brutally', 'honest', 'look', 'loss', 'grief', 'constant', 'struggle', 'find', 'sense', 'normalcy', 'life', ""n't"", 'normal', 'anymore', 'Watching', 'film', 'once', 'surely', 'enough', 'very', 'few', 'films', 'are', 'depressing', 'watching', 'once', 'definite', 'must', 'are', 'few', 'films', 'really', 'understand', 'complex', 'subject', 'as', 'well', 'Rabbit', 'Hole', ""'ve"", 'never', 'lost', 'child', 'have', 'two', 'so', 'understand', 'deeply', 'parents', 'love', 'small', 'being', 'want', 'so', 'much', 'protect', 'everything', 'everyone.But', 'ca', ""n't"", 'always', 'do', 'that.', 'Rabbit', 'Hole', 'picks', 'eight', 'months', 'death', 'four-year-old', 'Danny', 'parents', 'Becca', 'Howie', 'are', 'struggling', 'pick', 'up', 'broken', 'pieces', 'lives', 'Becca', 'became', 'reclusive', 'self-absorbed', 'cutting', 'off', 'everyone', 'attempt', 'internalize', 'pain', 'Howie', 'carry', 'life', 'acting', 'nothing', 'bothering', 'yet', 'off', 'late', 'night', 'same', 'video', 'phone', 'over', 'Becca', 'rid', 'herself', 'son', 'memory', 'clothes', 'toys', 'fingerprint', 'smudges', 'door', 'hinges', 'Howie', 'strengthen', 'memory', 'going', 'as', 'far', 'keep', 'son', 'car-seat', 'car', 'way', 'holding', 'what', 'lost', 'Becca', 'advice', 'comforts', 'others', 'especially', 'mother', 'comforts', 'advice', 'can', 'not', 'replace', 'hole', 'heart', 'Howie', 'other', 'experiences', 'finding', 'doorway', 'answers', 'help', 'make', 'grief', 'more', 'tolerable.In', 'other', 'words', 'Becca', 'Howie', 'are', 'grieving', 'drastically', 'different', 'ways.', 'Rabbit', 'Hole', 'snapshot', 'lives', 'Becca', 'Howie', 'uncovers', 'how', 'cope', 'eventually', 'come', 'terms', 'move', 'learning', 'once', 'again', 'how', 'rely', 'one', 'When', 'tragedy', 'strikes', 'easy', 'take', 'things', 'out', 'closest', 'when', 'are', 'hurting', 'so', 'severely', 'bigger', 'struggle', 'expect', 'so', 'much', 'other', 'person', 'Howie', 'be', 'rock', 'encouragement', 'yet', 'who', 'supposed', 'cry', 'same', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'Becca', 'who', 'had', 'world', 'ripped', 'out', 'yet', 'still', 'contend', 'needs', 'husband', 'not', 'mention', 'mother', 'newly', 'pregnant', 'sister', 'Life', 'even', 'when', 'want', 'stop', 'hard', 'lesson', 'learn.Nicole', 'Kidman', 'sensational', 'here', 'Becca', 'effortlessly', 'truly', 'sinking', 'character', 'such', 'complex', 'character', 'need', 'be', 'able', 'convey', 'more', 'pain', 'suffering', 'order', 'make', 'character', 'feel', 'real', 'invested', 'relatable', 'moment', 'lacing', 'pain', 'sense', 'wanting', 'scenes', 'Miles', 'Teller', 'are', 'truly', 'remarkable', 'Speaking', 'Miles', 'Teller', 'just', 'beautifully', 'sincere', 'here', 'tears', 'running', 'down', 'cheek', 'kill', 'Aaron', 'Eckhart', 'backseat', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', ""n't"", 'phone', 'anything', 'rely', 'carry', 'film', ""n't"", 'have', 'showiest', 'performance', 'film', 'how', 'elicit', 'genuine', 'emotions', 'complement', 'approach', 'Nicole', 'was', 'taking', 'Dianne', 'Wiest', 'always', 'welcomed', 'force', 'once', 'again', 'far', 'more', 'just', 'sublime', 'comedic', 'actress', 'also', 'sublime', 'dramatic', 'one.Aside', 'acting', 'film', 'technical', 'level', 'as', 'well', 'boasting', 'beautifully', 'controlled', 'score', 'richly', 'intriguing', 'framing', 'choices', 'elevated', 'film', 'gave', 'such', 'otherworldly', 'feel', 'capturing', 'emotional', 'purgatory', 'key', 'characters.', 'Rabbit', 'Hole', 'unapologetically', 'depressing', 'Thank', 'god', 'pot', 'smoking', 'scene', 'helped', 'cut', 'film', 'thickly', 'layered', 'grief', 'short-lived', 'yet', 'much', 'needed', 'comedic', 'moment', 'said', 'really', 'other', 'way', 'tell', 'kind', 'story', 'so', 'bravo', 'involved', 'going', 'there', 'film', 'glimmer', 'hope', 'proof', 'can', 'get', 'back', 'track', 'matter', 'how', 'difficult', 'do', 'so.Without', 'doubt', 'one', 'best', 'films', '2010']",Rabbit Hole
1393301,A1RLJ55YIKMQQW,B004AE3QY4,"Ashley C, ""Apu Nahasapeemapetilon""","[3, 7]","*Spoiler Alert*This is the story (for those who don't already know) of a married couple, Howie and Becca, living in a New York suburb about eight months after their four year old son, Danny, chased his dog into the street and was killed by a passing car driven by a teenage boy, Jason.Suffering the loss of a child is something that most people don't go through. For those reading this gearing an angry response, I know that it does happen to some, and my heart goes out to them. My point is that a lot of people might not understand this movie (possibly not even myself, not having children at all) or the reactions of Howie and Becca, which I will elaborate on in a sec.Nicole Kidman's character, Becca, is trying desperately to move on and simultaneously keep it all together. At one point, she tries to give her son's old clothing to her newly pregnant sister. Her sister rejects that offer, saying that it would be ""too weird"" to see her baby running around in Danny's clothes. Becca is completely crushed but somehow holds it all together long enough to take all of her son's clothing to a Goodwill drop box. And that example really describes the whole movie, a lot of scenes of reserved emotion, punctuated by huge explosions of emotion which seem insurmountable for this couple. I'm really sad that Nicole Kidman is getting all of the credit for this movie, because Aaron Eckhart really earns his stripes as Howie, Becca's husband who also quietly grieves and struggles to do the right things to keep his marriage together.So, all that being said, with my previous point in mind, I have to say that through the entire movie, I was completely repulsed by Becca. Her behavior was really disgusting, especially towards her husband. She obviously feels a lot of anger towards herself AND Howie for the accident (they both blame themselves for leaving the gate to their yard open, although Becca does truly believe that it is no one's fault - more on this later). Howie consoles himself by watching and old iPhone video of Danny and going to a support group, which he tries to get Becca to join. Becca deals by basically purging the house of all memory of their son - pictures he made from the fridge, throwing out all of his old clothes. I don't necessarily think that her actions are all bad - she is trying to move on, after all - but she does all of these things without dealing emotionally, so she's really just a huge basket case. She eventually does go to group therapy with Howie one night, only to cruelly interrupt another couple who is trying to cope with the loss of their own child (the scene from the trailer, which looks funny, is actually very cold as the other parents are crushed by her words).The other salient point is the relationship that Becca builds with Jason, the teenage driver of the car that killed her son. She accidentally sees him on a bus and ends up following him home, eventually running into him at a library and starting a strange (completely platonic) relationship with him - she forgives him for the accident completely, but also sees him (I think) as a projection of her son, had he lived. She (of course) doesn't tell her husband about any of this, so when Jason comes to the house to show Becca a comic book he drew, Howie freaks out, obviously not having accepted Jason's actions as accidental (even though they were). Becca responds by calling Howie an (rhymes with basshole) and storming out. Again, I can't relate to Becca at all on this. She doesn't tell her husband about seeing Jason, so when the kid unexpectedly shows up at their house and he has a negative reaction, HER negative reaction seems so overblown, especially since he is so patient with her throughout the whole movie. Towards the end, Becca further traumatizes this poor kid by showing up outside his house and completely breaking down in her car while watching him leave for prom. Of course, Jason sees her, and his confusion and anguish is apparent, but he can't do anything for Becca as he is in a car full of his friends already driving away. I understand that I'm supposed to be moved by Becca's catharsis, but I can't stop thinking of the horror on Jason's face when he sees her.So really, the review is that the acting is a amazing (look out for the newcomer who played Jason, and Dianne Wiest is amazing as always), but I found Becca's character so difficult to relate to that it ruined a lot of the movie for me. I would say that it's... worth seeing if you think you can put aside a difficult character to see the other stars shine.",3,"Fantastic acting, but a horrible lead character",1304985600,"05 10, 2011",2011,4559,"['*Spoiler', 'Alert*This', 'story', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'already', 'know', 'married', 'couple', 'Howie', 'Becca', 'living', 'New', 'York', 'suburb', 'eight', 'months', 'four', 'year', 'old', 'son', 'Danny', 'chased', 'dog', 'street', 'was', 'killed', 'passing', 'car', 'driven', 'teenage', 'boy', 'Jason.Suffering', 'loss', 'child', 'something', 'most', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'reading', 'gearing', 'angry', 'response', 'know', 'happen', 'heart', 'out', 'point', 'lot', 'people', 'might', 'not', 'understand', 'movie', 'possibly', 'not', 'even', 'not', 'having', 'children', 'reactions', 'Howie', 'Becca', 'will', 'elaborate', 'sec.Nicole', 'Kidman', 'character', 'Becca', 'trying', 'desperately', 'move', 'simultaneously', 'keep', 'together', 'one', 'point', 'give', 'son', 'old', 'clothing', 'newly', 'pregnant', 'sister', 'sister', 'rejects', 'offer', 'saying', 'would', 'be', 'too', 'weird', 'see', 'baby', 'running', 'around', 'Danny', 'clothes', 'Becca', 'completely', 'crushed', 'somehow', 'together', 'long', 'enough', 'take', 'son', 'clothing', 'Goodwill', 'drop', 'box', 'example', 'really', 'whole', 'movie', 'lot', 'scenes', 'reserved', 'emotion', 'punctuated', 'huge', 'explosions', 'emotion', 'seem', 'insurmountable', 'couple', ""'m"", 'really', 'sad', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'getting', 'credit', 'movie', 'Aaron', 'Eckhart', 'really', 'stripes', 'Howie', 'Becca', 'husband', 'who', 'also', 'quietly', 'grieves', 'struggles', 'do', 'right', 'things', 'keep', 'marriage', 'together.So', 'being', 'said', 'previous', 'point', 'mind', 'have', 'say', 'entire', 'movie', 'was', 'completely', 'repulsed', 'Becca', 'behavior', 'was', 'really', 'disgusting', 'especially', 'husband', 'obviously', 'lot', 'anger', 'towards', 'AND', 'Howie', 'accident', 'blame', 'leaving', 'gate', 'yard', 'open', 'Becca', 'truly', 'believe', 'one', 'fault', 'more', 'later', 'Howie', 'watching', 'old', 'iPhone', 'video', 'Danny', 'going', 'support', 'group', 'get', 'Becca', 'join', 'Becca', 'deals', 'basically', 'purging', 'house', 'memory', 'son', 'pictures', 'made', 'fridge', 'throwing', 'out', 'old', 'clothes', 'do', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'think', 'actions', 'are', 'bad', 'trying', 'move', 'things', 'dealing', 'emotionally', 'really', 'just', 'huge', 'basket', 'case', 'eventually', 'go', 'group', 'therapy', 'Howie', 'one', 'night', 'only', 'cruelly', 'interrupt', 'couple', 'who', 'trying', 'cope', 'loss', 'own', 'child', 'scene', 'trailer', 'funny', 'actually', 'very', 'cold', 'other', 'parents', 'are', 'crushed', 'words', '.The', 'other', 'salient', 'point', 'relationship', 'Becca', 'Jason', 'teenage', 'driver', 'car', 'killed', 'son', 'accidentally', 'bus', 'up', 'following', 'home', 'eventually', 'running', 'library', 'starting', 'strange', 'completely', 'platonic', 'relationship', 'accident', 'completely', 'also', 'think', 'projection', 'son', 'had', 'lived', 'course', ""n't"", 'tell', 'husband', 'so', 'when', 'Jason', 'house', 'show', 'Becca', 'comic', 'book', 'drew', 'Howie', 'out', 'obviously', 'not', 'having', 'accepted', 'Jason', 'actions', 'accidental', 'even', 'were', 'Becca', 'calling', 'Howie', 'rhymes', 'basshole', 'storming', 'out', 'Again', 'ca', ""n't"", 'relate', 'Becca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'husband', 'seeing', 'Jason', 'so', 'when', 'kid', 'unexpectedly', 'up', 'house', 'negative', 'reaction', 'HER', 'negative', 'reaction', 'so', 'overblown', 'especially', 'so', 'patient', 'whole', 'movie', 'end', 'Becca', 'further', 'poor', 'kid', 'showing', 'up', 'house', 'completely', 'breaking', 'down', 'car', 'watching', 'leave', 'prom', 'course', 'Jason', 'confusion', 'anguish', 'apparent', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'anything', 'Becca', 'car', 'full', 'friends', 'already', 'driving', 'away', 'understand', ""'m"", 'supposed', 'be', 'moved', 'Becca', 'catharsis', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stop', 'thinking', 'horror', 'Jason', 'face', 'when', 'her.So', 'really', 'review', 'acting', 'amazing', 'look', 'out', 'newcomer', 'who', 'played', 'Jason', 'Dianne', 'Wiest', 'amazing', 'always', 'found', 'Becca', 'character', 'so', 'difficult', 'relate', 'ruined', 'lot', 'movie', 'would', 'say', 'worth', 'seeing', 'think', 'can', 'put', 'aside', 'difficult', 'character', 'see', 'other', 'stars', 'shine']",Rabbit Hole
1393302,A30TQET02FLSUX,B004AE3QY4,BLACKBOXBLUE,"[3, 5]","One of the more serious dramatic movies I've seen from 2010 is Rabbit Hole (2010), starring Nicole Kidman, Aaron Eckhart, Dianne Wiest, and Sandra Oh. It's had a very limited release in theaters, where I was lucky to see it, but you'll definitely want to check it out on Blu-ray or DVD when it comes out if you can't still find it in a theater near you. Like the tagline on it's poster, the only way out of the dark emotional content of Rabbit Hole is through watching it. Rabbit Hole is ultimately a movie about grieving: the process it takes to get through it, how it changes us (or doesn't change us), and what we ultimately come to terms with. If you're having second thoughts about watching this movie, I encourage you to put those thoughts aside and watch the film anyway. I was surprised that I liked it as much as I did.What makes this film very good (3.5 stars out of 5) is the incredible writing, acting, and visual storytelling led by director John Cameron Mitchell. While Mitchell seemed an unusual choice for directing this story, I was very impressed with how he handled it. I haven't seen his first two movies, Hedwig and the Angry Inch (2001) and Shortbus (2006), which both have reputations for being VERY unique, controversial, and ""out there"" movies. Rabbit Hole is certainly not in those categories. It's a mainstream look at a story of two parents losing their young son to a tragic accidental death and how they deal with it.I think what surprised me the most with Rabbit Hole was how easily I got into the story of married couple Becca and Howie, played perfectly by Kidman and Eckhart. Their on screen marriage is very believable and well written. It's interesting that Becca and Howie deal with grieving over their young son's death opposite to the stereotypical gender-specific way that we would expect. Becca deals with the death more like a guy would, and Howie more like a woman. I think this twist helped make the story more interesting since stories similar to this one have been told before on TV and in the movies. With our changing gender roles in our current 21st century culture, men and women don't fit all nice and tidy into the boxes they used to. And Rabbit Hole isn't afraid to look at that along with death at the same time.I didn't really know much about the story going into see the film, and that was probably to my benefit as a viewer. It's not the story itself that makes Rabbit Hole better than most adult-oriented dramatic feature films, but all the elements that make up the movie. The cinematography is great from director of photography Frank G. DeMarco, along with excellent production design by Kalina Ivanov. Written by David Lindsay-Abaire, the script and the play on which this film is based, are realistic, current, and fresh in dialogue and emotional subtext. Director Mitchell brought what I assume is a bit of his taste to the film, but it didn't call attention to itself, which was good for this story.With a glut of superhero/action movies, comic book tales, and animated feature films filling our theaters every week, it's nice to have something else to see in the theater.

1393305,AW3VZ5O895LRK,B004AE3QY4,"carol irvin ""carol irvin""","[2, 3]","Nicole Kidman sure doesn't take the easy roles.  I'm sure it couldn't have even gotten made without her producing it as most viewers will have to motivate themselves to watch something this sad. The story involves a mother and father, Kidman and Eckart, who lost their four year old son eight months ago in a freak auto accident.  This is their trying to make some kind of life eight months after the fact.There is a very able supporting cast at work too, with Miles Teller as the teen driver of the car which killed their son.  He did nothing wrong.  He was doing the speed limit and the boy ran out into the street after his dog who was chasing a squirrel.  Dianne Wiest plays Kidman's mother who has never wholly recovered from the death of Kidman's brother (to heroin overdose).There are some really poignant scenes, such as when they are selling the house and the buyers ask about the son's room since everything in the room is as it was.  The buyers become like deer caught in the headlights as Eckart explains his son's death--you can just see their interest in the house end at that moment. Then Kidman starts meeting with the young boy driver.  They take some kind of strange comfort out of being with one another.  Then there is Kidman's sister, pregnant herself, which makes everyone in the family tense. This sister finds herself caught in one horrendous scene after another in what is supposed to be a relatively happy time for her.Probably the most awful experience though is trying to sit through group therapy with others who have lost their kids.  I can see why one might think this would be helpful.  I did until I watched them in it and then, like Kidman, I wanted to leave.So although I cannot call this ""enjoyable"" (there is way too much pain in this work), the acting is so excellent that it makes it worth watching.Keep an eye on Miles Teller.  I think we will be seeing him in a lot.  He shows a lot of promise here.In 2011, it is hard to believe that Nicole Kidman was forced to be in Tom Cruise's shadow for ten years of her acting career.  She is so talented that it is a shame she had to spend time in anyone's shadow.  Fortunately, she seems to be making her own creative decisions and living in no one's shadow even though she is remarried today.",4,Acting Is Great But Story is Very Sad,1301097600,"03 26, 2011",2011,2276,"['Nicole', 'Kidman', 'sure', ""n't"", 'take', 'easy', 'roles', ""'m"", 'sure', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'even', 'gotten', 'made', 'producing', 'most', 'viewers', 'will', 'have', 'motivate', 'watch', 'something', 'sad', 'story', 'mother', 'father', 'Kidman', 'Eckart', 'who', 'lost', 'four', 'year', 'old', 'son', 'eight', 'months', 'ago', 'freak', 'auto', 'accident', 'trying', 'make', 'kind', 'life', 'eight', 'months', 'fact.There', 'very', 'able', 'supporting', 'cast', 'work', 'too', 'Miles', 'Teller', 'teen', 'driver', 'car', 'killed', 'son', 'did', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'was', 'doing', 'speed', 'limit', 'boy', 'ran', 'out', 'street', 'dog', 'who', 'was', 'chasing', 'squirrel', 'Dianne', 'Wiest', 'Kidman', 'mother', 'who', 'never', 'wholly', 'recovered', 'death', 'Kidman', 'brother', 'heroin', 'overdose', 'are', 'really', 'poignant', 'scenes', 'such', 'when', 'are', 'selling', 'house', 'buyers', 'ask', 'son', 'room', 'everything', 'room', 'was', 'buyers', 'become', 'deer', 'caught', 'headlights', 'Eckart', 'son', 'death', 'can', 'just', 'see', 'interest', 'house', 'end', 'moment', 'Then', 'Kidman', 'meeting', 'young', 'boy', 'driver', 'take', 'kind', 'strange', 'comfort', 'being', 'one', 'Then', 'Kidman', 'sister', 'pregnant', 'herself', 'everyone', 'family', 'tense', 'sister', 'caught', 'one', 'horrendous', 'scene', 'what', 'supposed', 'be', 'relatively', 'happy', 'time', 'her.Probably', 'most', 'awful', 'experience', 'though', 'trying', 'sit', 'group', 'therapy', 'others', 'who', 'have', 'lost', 'kids', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'one', 'might', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'helpful', 'did', 'watched', 'then', 'Kidman', 'wanted', 'leave.So', 'can', 'not', 'call', 'enjoyable', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'pain', 'work', 'acting', 'so', 'excellent', 'worth', 'eye', 'Miles', 'Teller', 'think', 'will', 'be', 'seeing', 'lot', 'lot', 'promise', 'here.In', '2011', 'hard', 'believe', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'was', 'forced', 'be', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'shadow', 'ten', 'years', 'acting', 'career', 'so', 'talented', 'shame', 'had', 'spend', 'time', 'anyone', 'shadow', 'Fortunately', 'be', 'making', 'own', 'creative', 'decisions', 'living', 'one', 'shadow', 'even', 'remarried', 'today']",Rabbit Hole

1393309,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B004AE3QY4,Chris Pandolfi,"[2, 3]","Grief is an individual process. There is no one way experience it. It's not a scheduled allotment of time; it could begin directly after a tragedy, but then again, it could begin five years later, or ten, and it's going to last for as long as it's going to last. Some people have the coping skills to move on. Others remain in despair for the rest of their lives. Is the former the right way to go about it? I don't know. Coping skills could refer to anything. If one person finds solace in friends, family, or faith, another person invariably takes comfort in an emotional vacuum of his or her own creation. They may plunge into work or distract themselves endlessly with personal projects. They may even abandon their lives altogether and then delude themselves into believing that nothing bad ever happened.""Rabbit Hole,"" an adaptation of David Lindsay-Abaire's Pulitzer Prize winning play, is about the different ways people experience grief. It doesn't coerce the audience into accepting a preconceived notion of loss and mourning. It presents the characters as they are, and never once are judgments made about them. Rather than address the audience in conventional absolutes of misery or hope, it instead sends the message that, regardless of what hand you've been dealt, life comes with no guarantees. It's all about living one day at a time; it's pointless to dwell on what might happen tomorrow or the next day or a decade from now. It's not the best solution, but it's the only solution there is. It's reality.The film centers on Becca (Nicole Kidman) and Howie (Aaron Eckhart), whose four-year-old son, Danny, was killed after being struck by a car. A lesser film would have opened on a note of unremitting bliss, mom and dad happily caring for their young son in their suburban New York neighborhood; we would then have to endure the soppy melodrama of both the accident and the funeral, which would no doubt be held on a rainy day and feature lots of close-ups of Becca's tear-stained face. But this isn't a lesser film. The story begins eight months after the accident. There's no graveyard. There's no memorial site. It's just Becca and Howie, who have since settled into a functioning but incredibly strained routine.They're not on the same page when it comes to their son's death. Becca, while seemingly sensible and conscientious, is not allowing herself to feel and is subconsciously trying to erase all physical evidence that her son existed. That isn't easy in the house of a four-year-old; there are dozens of school paintings, a closet full of clothes, a completely furnished room stuffed with toys, and fingerprints on cabinets and doors. Even the family dog was too much for her to handle, for it played a part in her son's death. Howie is not the kind of person who wants his son's life erased. He's especially fond of a video stored on his cell phone - presumably the last footage of him ever shot. Howie is ready to rekindle a physical relationship. Becca is not. Howie takes Becca to group therapy sessions with other parents who have lost children. Becca is not at all interested in what they have to say and sees no point in participating.Becca's sister, the irresponsible Izzy (Tammy Blanchard), is pregnant and often the target of Becca's resentment. Their mother, Nat (Dianne Wiest), tries to be the voice of reason but fails to understand why her daughter refuses to let anyone comfort her. She too has been down that long, dark road of grief, but every time she tries to explain where she's coming from, Becca refuses to listen, believing that the comparison is cruel and unfair.Howie seeks out a kindred spirit and finds one in Gabby (Sandra Oh), who has been attending the group therapy sessions for the past eight years. Becca, in turn, forms a very unlikely friendship with Jason (Miles Teller), a high school student who was driving the car that killed her son. He's far from a sadistic monster. He's consumed with guilt. His coping mechanism is a comic book he's writing and illustrating on his own, one in which multiple universes and time/space portals called rabbit holes advance the plot.Of all the films I've seen this year, none have been as believable, as powerful, or as resonant as ""Rabbit Hole."" It's brilliant in that it never tries to tell us what to think or how to feel. It doesn't make assertions about who's right and who's wrong. It presents people as they actually are in a grieving state; whichever side we choose - and naturally, we will choose - is dependent not on the filmmaker's motives, but solely on what we personally bring to the film. The performances are amongst the most compelling of any recently given. A movie this good deserves more than a place on a critic's top ten list. It also deserves special attention from audiences, for as of now, they're unlikely to come across one with a better understanding of human nature. This is one of the year's best films.",5,The Reality of Grief,1292544000,"12 17, 2010",2010,4936,"['Grief', 'individual', 'process', 'one', 'way', 'experience', 'not', 'scheduled', 'allotment', 'time', 'could', 'begin', 'directly', 'tragedy', 'then', 'again', 'could', 'begin', 'five', 'years', 'later', 'ten', 'going', 'last', 'as', 'long', 'going', 'last', 'people', 'have', 'coping', 'skills', 'move', 'Others', 'remain', 'despair', 'rest', 'lives', 'former', 'right', 'way', 'go', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Coping', 'skills', 'could', 'refer', 'anything', 'one', 'person', 'solace', 'friends', 'family', 'faith', 'person', 'invariably', 'comfort', 'emotional', 'vacuum', 'own', 'creation', 'may', 'plunge', 'work', 'distract', 'endlessly', 'personal', 'projects', 'may', 'even', 'abandon', 'lives', 'altogether', 'then', 'delude', 'believing', 'nothing', 'bad', 'ever', 'happened', 'Rabbit', 'Hole', 'adaptation', 'David', 'Lindsay-Abaire', 'Pulitzer', 'Prize', 'winning', 'play', 'different', 'ways', 'people', 'experience', 'grief', ""n't"", 'coerce', 'audience', 'accepting', 'preconceived', 'notion', 'loss', 'mourning', 'characters', 'are', 'never', 'once', 'are', 'judgments', 'made', 'Rather', 'address', 'audience', 'conventional', 'absolutes', 'misery', 'hope', 'instead', 'message', 'regardless', 'what', 'hand', ""'ve"", 'been', 'dealt', 'life', 'guarantees', 'living', 'one', 'day', 'time', 'pointless', 'dwell', 'might', 'happen', 'tomorrow', 'next', 'day', 'decade', 'now', 'not', 'best', 'solution', 'only', 'solution', 'reality.The', 'film', 'centers', 'Becca', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'Howie', 'Aaron', 'Eckhart', 'four-year-old', 'son', 'Danny', 'was', 'killed', 'being', 'struck', 'car', 'lesser', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'opened', 'note', 'unremitting', 'bliss', 'mom', 'dad', 'happily', 'caring', 'young', 'son', 'suburban', 'New', 'York', 'neighborhood', 'would', 'then', 'have', 'endure', 'soppy', 'melodrama', 'accident', 'funeral', 'would', 'doubt', 'be', 'held', 'rainy', 'day', 'feature', 'lots', 'close-ups', 'Becca', 'tear-stained', 'face', ""n't"", 'lesser', 'film', 'story', 'eight', 'months', 'accident', 'graveyard', 'memorial', 'site', 'just', 'Becca', 'Howie', 'who', 'have', 'settled', 'functioning', 'incredibly', 'strained', 'routine.They', ""'re"", 'not', 'same', 'page', 'when', 'son', 'death', 'Becca', 'seemingly', 'sensible', 'conscientious', 'not', 'allowing', 'feel', 'subconsciously', 'trying', 'erase', 'physical', 'evidence', 'son', 'existed', ""n't"", 'easy', 'house', 'four-year-old', 'are', 'dozens', 'school', 'paintings', 'closet', 'full', 'clothes', 'completely', 'furnished', 'room', 'stuffed', 'toys', 'fingerprints', 'cabinets', 'doors', 'Even', 'family', 'dog', 'was', 'too', 'much', 'handle', 'played', 'part', 'son', 'death', 'Howie', 'not', 'kind', 'person', 'who', 'son', 'life', 'erased', 'especially', 'fond', 'video', 'stored', 'cell', 'phone', 'presumably', 'last', 'footage', 'ever', 'shot', 'Howie', 'ready', 'rekindle', 'physical', 'relationship', 'Becca', 'not', 'Howie', 'Becca', 'group', 'therapy', 'sessions', 'other', 'parents', 'who', 'have', 'lost', 'children', 'Becca', 'not', 'interested', 'what', 'have', 'say', 'point', 'participating.Becca', 'sister', 'irresponsible', 'Izzy', 'Tammy', 'Blanchard', 'pregnant', 'often', 'target', 'Becca', 'resentment', 'mother', 'Nat', 'Dianne', 'Wiest', 'be', 'voice', 'reason', 'understand', 'why', 'daughter', 'let', 'anyone', 'comfort', 'too', 'been', 'down', 'long', 'dark', 'road', 'grief', 'time', 'explain', 'where', 'coming', 'Becca', 'listen', 'believing', 'comparison', 'cruel', 'unfair.Howie', 'out', 'kindred', 'spirit', 'one', 'Gabby', 'Sandra', 'Oh', 'who', 'been', 'attending', 'group', 'therapy', 'sessions', 'past', 'eight', 'years', 'Becca', 'turn', 'very', 'unlikely', 'friendship', 'Jason', 'Miles', 'Teller', 'high', 'school', 'student', 'who', 'was', 'driving', 'car', 'killed', 'son', 'far', 'sadistic', 'monster', 'consumed', 'guilt', 'coping', 'mechanism', 'comic', 'book', 'writing', 'illustrating', 'own', 'one', 'multiple', 'universes', 'time/space', 'portals', 'called', 'rabbit', 'holes', 'advance', 'plot.Of', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'year', 'none', 'have', 'been', 'believable', 'powerful', 'as', 'resonant', 'Rabbit', 'Hole', 'brilliant', 'never', 'tell', 'think', 'how', 'feel', ""n't"", 'make', 'assertions', 'who', 'right', 'who', 'wrong', 'people', 'actually', 'are', 'grieving', 'state', 'choose', 'naturally', 'will', 'choose', 'dependent', 'not', 'filmmaker', 'motives', 'solely', 'what', 'personally', 'bring', 'film', 'performances', 'are', 'amongst', 'most', 'compelling', 'recently', 'given', 'movie', 'good', 'more', 'place', 'critic', 'top', 'ten', 'list', 'also', 'special', 'attention', 'audiences', 'now', ""'re"", 'unlikely', 'come', 'one', 'better', 'understanding', 'human', 'nature', 'one', 'year', 'best', 'films']",Rabbit Hole

While I wasn't depressed when I sat down to watch it and still enjoyed it, I'm a rare exception as I'm obsessed with cinema and see movies like this primarily for the acting, directing style, and cinematography. The average Joe, may find it emotionally exhausting. There's a reason this film was released in a limited circuit and right at Oscar Season.The attention is on Nicole Kidman in her performance that's granted her with her third Academy Award nomination, and it's more than a worthy nomination indeed. If like me you're a fan of her work, you won't be disappointed.There is very little commercial cinematic value to this film, and that is both what I loved about it, and what will cripple its chance for any wide acclaim from its viewers. It's about life, it's realistic, and it's a downer from start to finish. It's a story about loss and not how the characters circled in it overcome that loss, but how they adjust to it and somehow manage to move on with their lives.Eight months ago Becca and Howie (Kidman and Aaron Eckhart), lost their 4-year-old son when he ran after the family dog in the street and was killed by a vehicle that swerved to miss the dog, not seeing the child until it was too late. Now Becca and Howie attend a couples group for grieving parents who have lost their children.Well, they do until Becca has had enough of the religious views being offered up as explanations for the early deaths of the children. Finding more comfort in the group, Howie continues to go without her and soon engages in an inappropriate friendship with a single mother from the group (Sandra Oh). I won't tell you with whom or why, but Becca initiates her own little private meetings with someone she can talk to as well.This is what I found most fascinating about this story; how we see these two characters deal with their grief in their own ways. Sex is no longer an option; Becca has made that perfectly clear. Howie doesn't blame the dog and wants him around but Becca does not. Howie holds resentment against the driver of the car and Becca does not. Howie holds onto sentimental things like videos of their son, and his fingerprints left around the house; Becca disregards these and wants to sell the house.Despite their lack of a sex life, and the distance in their marriage overall, we believe that Becca and Howie will somehow get through this. They love each other, but they are both human beings, effected by deep emotions and it will be quite a while before they are at peace. Heavy as all that is, there is surprisingly a good bit of comedy we can all relate too as well; and don't worry it fits nicely amidst the flow of intense sequences.Nicole Kidman is a seriously gifted actress and she plays Becca with such a unique grace. For most of the film she appears as though everything is fine. But every now and then things strike a chord in her that makes the pain explode out of her. Whether it be her mother (Diane Wiest) comparing the death of Becca's 4-year-old with an adult son of her own who died of a drug overdose; or a stranger in a supermarket who says something hurtful - Kidman displays her talents through Becca in the rawest of forms, and it's as good as magic.And whilst on the subject of good acting, grab a pen and jot down this name: Miles Teller. He has a small part in the film as a teenager named Jason; but you won't forget him (plus the title centers on his character). He was miraculous and will no doubt go on to do big things in his career. Maybe he picked up a thing or two from Kidman.",4,Rabbit Hole Review,1297123200,"02 8, 2011",2011,4014,"['RABBIT', 'HOLESTARRING', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'Aaron', 'Eckhart', 'Sandra', 'Oh', 'Diane', 'Wiest', 'Miles', 'Teller', 'Tammy', 'Blanchard', 'Giancarlo', 'EspositoWRITTEN', 'BY', 'David', 'Lindsay-Abaire', 'based', 'playDIRECTED', 'BY', 'John', 'Cameron', 'MitchellRated', 'PG', '13Genre', 'DramaRelease', 'Date', '17', 'December', '2010Review', 'Date', '03', 'February', '2011Rabbit', 'Hole', 'good', 'movie', 'kind', 'movie', 'need', 'be', 'right', 'mindset', 'mood', 'watch', 'What', 'mood', 'appropriate', 'ask', 'Well', 'depressed', 'would', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'was', ""n't"", 'depressed', 'when', 'sat', 'down', 'watch', 'still', 'enjoyed', ""'m"", 'rare', 'exception', ""'m"", 'obsessed', 'cinema', 'see', 'movies', 'primarily', 'acting', 'directing', 'style', 'cinematography', 'average', 'Joe', 'may', 'find', 'emotionally', 'exhausting', 'reason', 'film', 'was', 'released', 'limited', 'circuit', 'right', 'Oscar', 'Season.The', 'attention', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'performance', 'granted', 'third', 'Academy', 'Award', 'nomination', 'more', 'worthy', 'nomination', 'indeed', ""'re"", 'fan', 'work', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed.There', 'very', 'little', 'commercial', 'cinematic', 'value', 'film', 'what', 'loved', 'what', 'will', 'cripple', 'chance', 'wide', 'acclaim', 'viewers', 'life', 'realistic', 'downer', 'start', 'finish', 'story', 'loss', 'not', 'how', 'characters', 'circled', 'overcome', 'loss', 'how', 'adjust', 'somehow', 'manage', 'move', 'lives.Eight', 'months', 'Becca', 'Howie', 'Kidman', 'Aaron', 'Eckhart', 'lost', '4-year-old', 'son', 'when', 'ran', 'family', 'dog', 'street', 'was', 'killed', 'vehicle', 'swerved', 'miss', 'dog', 'not', 'seeing', 'child', 'was', 'too', 'late', 'Now', 'Becca', 'Howie', 'attend', 'couples', 'group', 'grieving', 'parents', 'who', 'have', 'lost', 'children.Well', 'do', 'Becca', 'had', 'religious', 'views', 'being', 'offered', 'up', 'explanations', 'early', 'deaths', 'children', 'Finding', 'more', 'comfort', 'group', 'Howie', 'go', 'soon', 'engages', 'inappropriate', 'friendship', 'single', 'mother', 'group', 'Sandra', 'Oh', 'wo', ""n't"", 'tell', 'whom', 'why', 'Becca', 'own', 'little', 'private', 'meetings', 'someone', 'can', 'talk', 'well.This', 'what', 'found', 'most', 'fascinating', 'story', 'how', 'see', 'two', 'characters', 'deal', 'grief', 'own', 'ways', 'Sex', 'no', 'longer', 'option', 'Becca', 'made', 'perfectly', 'clear', 'Howie', ""n't"", 'blame', 'dog', 'around', 'Becca', 'not', 'Howie', 'resentment', 'driver', 'car', 'Becca', 'not', 'Howie', 'sentimental', 'things', 'videos', 'son', 'fingerprints', 'left', 'house', 'Becca', 'sell', 'lack', 'sex', 'life', 'distance', 'marriage', 'overall', 'believe', 'Becca', 'Howie', 'will', 'somehow', 'get', 'love', 'other', 'are', 'human', 'beings', 'effected', 'deep', 'emotions', 'will', 'be', 'quite', 'while', 'are', 'peace', 'Heavy', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'bit', 'comedy', 'can', 'relate', 'too', 'as', 'well', 'do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'nicely', 'amidst', 'flow', 'intense', 'sequences.Nicole', 'Kidman', 'seriously', 'gifted', 'actress', 'Becca', 'unique', 'grace', 'most', 'film', 'everything', 'fine', 'now', 'then', 'things', 'strike', 'chord', 'pain', 'explode', 'Whether', 'be', 'mother', 'Diane', 'Wiest', 'comparing', 'death', 'Becca', '4-year-old', 'adult', 'son', 'own', 'who', 'died', 'drug', 'overdose', 'stranger', 'supermarket', 'who', 'something', 'hurtful', 'Kidman', 'talents', 'Becca', 'rawest', 'forms', 'as', 'good', 'magic.And', 'whilst', 'subject', 'good', 'acting', 'grab', 'pen', 'jot', 'down', 'name', 'Miles', 'Teller', 'small', 'part', 'film', 'teenager', 'named', 'Jason', 'wo', ""n't"", 'forget', 'title', 'centers', 'character', 'was', 'miraculous', 'will', 'doubt', 'go', 'do', 'big', 'things', 'career', 'Maybe', 'picked', 'up', 'thing', 'two', 'Kidman']",Rabbit Hole

In this case it's the loss of a couple's only son (a 4 year old hit by a car). To make it stand above the fray you need good writing, acting and a unique approach. This movie has all three.Nicole Kidman and Aaron Eckhart play the grieving parents. Both, for the most part, do a fine job. I'm glad Nicole is finding life after Tom Cruise. She IS good and she shows it here. Eckhart is always good and, with the exception of one scene, doesn't disappoint here. The writing is generally good. I liked the way the story unfolded. They didn't heap things on you all at once. The viewer is gradually introduced to the various facets of the story. Kidman is generally set up as the bad guy. She's the more unyielding of the two when it comes to 'moving on.' Aaron is trying but is discovered to be just as unyielding when it comes to one important aspect of the situation.The directing, set design and all the things that make a good movie good are all at a professional level here. As good as the writing is, it does take some bad turns in the third act. There are some clunky scenes and one in particular where Eckhart overacts considerably. In another Dianne Wiest spouts wisdom beyond her character. But overall this is a good movie. There were some good insights and they didn't try to tie things up at the end. Life is messy and things don't always work out.

John Cameron Mitchell directs a cast that could not be better.  This is a stunning, quiet elegy about grief and its effects on those left behind.Becca (Nicole Kidman) and Howie (Aaron Eckhart) are attempting to paste together their lives since the loss 8 months ago of their only child Danny in a freak automobile accident: Danny was chasing his dog into the street and was hit and killed by  teenage driver Jason (Miles Teller). Becca and Howie have become recluses, unable to rise out of their grief.  Becca's mother Nat (Dianne Wiest) attempts to comfort Becca: Nat lost her son (Becca's brother) at age 30 to a heroin overdose and Nat's attempts to compare the two losses irritates Becca.  Becca's young flighty sister Izzy (Tammy Blanchard) becomes pregnant by her best friend's husband Auggie (Giancarlo Esposito) and the newly pregnant couple moves in with Nat.  Izzy's pregnancy is difficult for Beeca to watch for all the memories it raises.  Becca and Howie join a group therapy for couples who have lost children and there they meet Gaby (Sandra Oh) and her husband; their marriage is falling apart even after 8 years following the loss of their child.  Becca cannot tolerate the religious aspects of the group and leaves the group (Howie stays), but she is driven to speak Jason, the high school senior who accidentally hit Danny causing his death.  Howie continues in group therapy, bonding with Gaby while Becca bonds with Jason, a bright sensitive lad who is desperately sorry about the accident and shares his graphic novel concerning Parallel Universes with Becca.  The story ends leaving  the audience to figure out just how things will resolve.There is some very beautiful writing in this film.  A conversation between Becca and her mother about living with grief is a passage that should be available to anyone who has stumbled across loss of a loved one.  The conversations between Becca and Jason are luminous in their profound simplicity.  Each of the actors in the film give bravura performances - Kidman and Eckhart and Weist are particularly memorable  This is a fine film that has the courage to delve into a subject that is universal  yet too infrequently discussed.

Howie (the stunningly handsome Aaron Eckhart) is dealing with his grief by attending Group Therapy while Becca (Nicole Kidman) deals with it by cooking and gardening. Complicating matters are Becca's pregnant sister, chatty mother (Diane Weist - excellent as always), and a fellow group member with a crush on Howie (Sandra Oh in a wonderful, sympathetic role). ""Rabbit Hole"" turns creepy when Becca seeks out the teen who was involved in her son's accident and they begin an odd, uncomfortable friendship. The story is what it is but the performances are mixed. Eckhart is outstanding - the grief comes through his handsome face effortlessly and Weist and Oh are great in their supporting roles, but Kidman is less successful. Careful not to channel Mary Tyler Moore in ""Ordinary People"" or Sissy Spacek from ""In the Bedroom,"" Kidman instead plays Becca like Bree from ""Desperate Housewives"" without a speck of vunerability that Marcia Cross brings to that role.

Corbin ""Foster Corbin""","[49, 53]","""Rabbit Hole,"" based on the play with the same name by David Lindsay-Abaire and directed by John Mitchell Cameron, is an almost two hour insightful commentary on grief, more specifically the grief of two parents who have lost their four-year-old child because of an accident. He chased his dog into the street and ran in front of a car. The film opens eight months after the accident. Howie (Aaron Eckhart) and Becca (Nicole Kidman) are the parents consumed with their loss. They try practically everything-- going to a support group for parents who have lost children, getting rid of their son's clothes, letting a relative (at first) keep the dog, putting their house on the market for sale-- in an effort to get through what has to be the tragedy of all tragedies for parents, the loss of a child. Of course the question on every viewer's mind is whether Howie and Becca's marriage-- they obviously love each other very much-- will survive the horror they find themselves in.The film progresses from one intense deeply moving scene to another, but two stood out for me: (1) Howie and Becca attend the support group and are listening to one grieving father explain that God took his child because he needed another angel. Becca responds that she doesn't understand. Since he is God, why couldn't he just make another angel without bothering with the man's child. (2) Becca asks her mother (Dianne Wiest) does one ever get over the death of a child. (Becca's brother, a drug addict, has died as a fairly young man and is the cause of much conflict between her mother and her when her mother compares the two deaths.) Her mother responds that one never gets over the death of a child, but that the pain becomes different and something one can bear.Both Eckhart and Kidman give superlative performances as do the secondary characters as well. While the film is sad beyond measure, in a strange way it is comforting. Death and loss are universal, and most of us, if we live very long, will come eventually face to face with the loss of someone we love. You leave the theatre feeling that you have seen a movie that makes an honest statement about these sometimes awful, unspeakable situations we as humans find ourselves in.Highly recommended.",5,Sorrow Beyond Measure,1293840000,"01 1, 2011",2011,2241,"['Rabbit', 'Hole', 'based', 'play', 'same', 'name', 'David', 'Lindsay-Abaire', 'directed', 'John', 'Mitchell', 'Cameron', 'almost', 'two', 'hour', 'insightful', 'commentary', 'grief', 'more', 'specifically', 'grief', 'two', 'parents', 'who', 'have', 'lost', 'four-year-old', 'child', 'accident', 'chased', 'dog', 'street', 'ran', 'front', 'car', 'film', 'eight', 'months', 'accident', 'Howie', 'Aaron', 'Eckhart', 'Becca', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'are', 'parents', 'consumed', 'loss', 'try', 'practically', 'everything', 'going', 'support', 'group', 'parents', 'who', 'have', 'lost', 'children', 'getting', 'rid', 'son', 'clothes', 'letting', 'relative', 'first', 'keep', 'dog', 'putting', 'house', 'market', 'sale', 'effort', 'get', 'be', 'tragedy', 'tragedies', 'parents', 'loss', 'child', 'course', 'question', 'viewer', 'mind', 'Howie', 'Becca', 'marriage', 'obviously', 'love', 'other', 'very', 'much', 'will', 'survive', 'horror', 'find', 'in.The', 'film', 'progresses', 'one', 'intense', 'deeply', 'moving', 'scene', 'two', 'stood', 'out', '1', 'Howie', 'Becca', 'attend', 'support', 'group', 'are', 'listening', 'one', 'grieving', 'father', 'explain', 'God', 'took', 'child', 'needed', 'angel', 'Becca', ""n't"", 'understand', 'God', 'why', 'could', ""n't"", 'just', 'make', 'angel', 'bothering', 'man', 'child', '2', 'Becca', 'mother', 'Dianne', 'Wiest', 'one', 'ever', 'get', 'death', 'child', 'Becca', 'brother', 'drug', 'addict', 'died', 'fairly', 'young', 'man', 'cause', 'much', 'conflict', 'mother', 'when', 'mother', 'two', 'deaths', 'mother', 'one', 'never', 'death', 'child', 'pain', 'different', 'something', 'one', 'can', 'bear.Both', 'Eckhart', 'Kidman', 'give', 'superlative', 'performances', 'do', 'secondary', 'characters', 'as', 'well', 'film', 'sad', 'measure', 'strange', 'way', 'comforting', 'Death', 'loss', 'are', 'universal', 'most', 'live', 'very', 'long', 'will', 'come', 'eventually', 'face', 'face', 'loss', 'someone', 'love', 'leave', 'theatre', 'feeling', 'have', 'seen', 'movie', 'honest', 'statement', 'sometimes', 'awful', 'unspeakable', 'situations', 'humans', 'find', 'in.Highly', 'recommended']",Rabbit Hole

1393327,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B004AE3QY4,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[1, 1]","John Cameron Mitchell makes a radical departure from his two previous films with the drama Rabbit Hole, based on the off-Broadway play by David Lindsay-Abaire who also wrote the screen adaptation. Nicole Kidman (also a co-producer) and Aaron Eckhart star as Becca and Howie, a married couple still coping with the death of their young son nearly a year earlier. This story is not new, but the way the material is handled makes it stand out.The death of their four-year-old son Danny has put a strain on Becca and Howie's marriage, with both their sex life and social life suffering as a result. While Howie continues working, Becca stays at home surrounded by reminders of her son. After trying to cope with his death together by attending a support group, the two look for ways to come to grips with their situation separately. While Howie befriends a pot-smoking member of the support group named Gaby (Sandra Oh), Becca initiates contact with Jason (Miles Teller), the teenager who accidentally ran over her son. Dianne Wiest co-stars as Nat, Becca's mother alongside Tammy Blanchard as Izzy, Becca's newly pregnant sister.The supporting cast adds a lot of depth to the film that has gone widely unmentioned. Sandra Oh brings humor, as well as dramatic poignancy to the film while Teller perfectly captures the sadness of his young, guilt-ridden character. The real stand-out among the supporting cast is Wiest, a two-time Oscar winning actress whom I haven't seen too often lately. Why isn't she in higher demand? She proved decades ago that she's a terrific actress and shows here that she hasn't lost any of her ability. While the rest of the cast (particularly the leads) crank up the emotional level to 11, Wiest opts for a much quieter, but no less moving performance.Kidman and Eckhart deliver career-best performances and make this film the powerful drama that it is. Kidman (in an Oscar-nominated role) plays the contemptuously bitter Becca with great warmth and humor. She's a marvelous, underappreciated actress who taps into some dark corners of the heart here making her a very deserving recipient of her Oscar nod. While much praise has been given to Kidman, it is Eckhart who gives the most emotional, Oscar-worthy performance despite being overlooked by both critics and audiences. There's a lot of raw power in both performances and I cite two scenes to emphasize this; (1) when Becca slaps a woman in the supermarket and (2) a scene mid-way through the film where Becca and Howie get into an explosive argument. The emotion and sincerity that Eckhart projects in the latter scene is heartbreaking. Considering this scene and another in which Howie unexpectedly confronts with Jason, it is unfathomable how Eckhart didn't get nominated for his performance. It's a tragedy he hasn't at least gotten more recognition for his stunning work.Writer Lindsay-Abaire handles this subject matter with great sensitivity while wisely avoiding sentimentality. The film's frank, direct dialogue and complicated emotional structure make Rabbit Hole a much more poignant, gripping film than the usual melodramatic fare that spawns from this type of story. Linday-Abaire doesn't avoid opportunities for humor while telling this story and it's used to great effect. The scene where Eckhart and Oh attend group stoned is hilarious within the context of the film.Meanwhile, Mitchell demonstrates substantial range as a director. While his previous two films were preoccupied with the sexual element of relationships, here he displays a perceptive talent for capturing the emotional element as well. He does great justice to this material in the way he handles it too. An example of what I mean is that we never see or hear the son's death, only the expressions on the faces of Becca and Jason. It's a powerful scene that uses only the body language of the actors and the graceful cinematography to illustrate this pivotal event. By shooting the scene in this manner, rather than showing the boy's death, it is much more affective.The film concludes nicely, neither ending with sappy optimism or bleak misery. It wraps up on a poignant, hopeful note but not a predictable one. I have seen this film twice and I believe it's one of the best films of 2010. It's an acting piece that gives under-appreciated actors to really showcase their talent, but it's backed by a deeply felt script and sensitive direction. While it lacks the gritty, emotional realism of a film like Blue Valentine it loses none of its original impact on a second viewing. With that said, despite a glimmer of hope for the characters, the film is a bit of a downer and I can't imagine watching it again. Don't let that dissuade you from seeing it though, as it's one of the most powerful and emotionally effective dramas I've seen recently.GRADE: A-",5,A Little-Seen Gem from 2010,1296000000,"01 26, 2011",2011,4819,"['John', 'Cameron', 'Mitchell', 'radical', 'departure', 'two', 'previous', 'films', 'drama', 'Rabbit', 'Hole', 'based', 'off-Broadway', 'play', 'David', 'Lindsay-Abaire', 'who', 'also', 'wrote', 'screen', 'adaptation', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'also', 'co-producer', 'Aaron', 'Eckhart', 'star', 'Becca', 'Howie', 'married', 'couple', 'still', 'coping', 'death', 'young', 'son', 'nearly', 'year', 'earlier', 'story', 'not', 'new', 'way', 'material', 'handled', 'stand', 'out.The', 'death', 'four-year-old', 'son', 'Danny', 'put', 'strain', 'Becca', 'Howie', 'marriage', 'sex', 'life', 'social', 'life', 'suffering', 'result', 'Howie', 'working', 'Becca', 'home', 'surrounded', 'reminders', 'son', 'trying', 'cope', 'death', 'together', 'attending', 'support', 'group', 'two', 'look', 'ways', 'come', 'grips', 'situation', 'separately', 'Howie', 'pot-smoking', 'member', 'support', 'group', 'named', 'Gaby', 'Sandra', 'Oh', 'Becca', 'contact', 'Jason', 'Miles', 'Teller', 'teenager', 'who', 'accidentally', 'ran', 'son', 'Dianne', 'Wiest', 'co-stars', 'Nat', 'Becca', 'mother', 'alongside', 'Tammy', 'Blanchard', 'Izzy', 'Becca', 'newly', 'pregnant', 'sister.The', 'supporting', 'cast', 'lot', 'depth', 'film', 'gone', 'widely', 'unmentioned', 'Sandra', 'Oh', 'humor', 'as', 'well', 'dramatic', 'poignancy', 'film', 'Teller', 'perfectly', 'sadness', 'young', 'guilt-ridden', 'character', 'real', 'stand-out', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Wiest', 'two-time', 'Oscar', 'winning', 'actress', 'whom', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'too', 'often', 'lately', 'Why', ""n't"", 'higher', 'demand', 'proved', 'decades', 'terrific', 'actress', 'here', ""n't"", 'lost', 'ability', 'rest', 'cast', 'particularly', 'leads', 'crank', 'up', 'emotional', 'level', '11', 'Wiest', 'much', 'quieter', 'less', 'moving', 'performance.Kidman', 'Eckhart', 'deliver', 'career-best', 'performances', 'make', 'film', 'powerful', 'drama', 'Kidman', 'Oscar-nominated', 'role', 'contemptuously', 'bitter', 'Becca', 'great', 'warmth', 'humor', 'marvelous', 'underappreciated', 'actress', 'who', 'dark', 'corners', 'heart', 'here', 'making', 'very', 'deserving', 'recipient', 'Oscar', 'nod', 'much', 'praise', 'been', 'given', 'Kidman', 'Eckhart', 'who', 'most', 'emotional', 'Oscar-worthy', 'performance', 'being', 'overlooked', 'critics', 'audiences', 'lot', 'raw', 'power', 'performances', 'cite', 'two', 'scenes', 'emphasize', '1', 'when', 'Becca', 'woman', 'supermarket', '2', 'scene', 'mid-way', 'film', 'where', 'Becca', 'Howie', 'get', 'explosive', 'argument', 'emotion', 'sincerity', 'Eckhart', 'projects', 'latter', 'scene', 'heartbreaking', 'Considering', 'scene', 'Howie', 'unexpectedly', 'Jason', 'unfathomable', 'how', 'Eckhart', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'nominated', 'performance', 'tragedy', ""n't"", 'least', 'gotten', 'more', 'recognition', 'stunning', 'work.Writer', 'Lindsay-Abaire', 'subject', 'matter', 'great', 'sensitivity', 'wisely', 'avoiding', 'sentimentality', 'film', 'frank', 'direct', 'dialogue', 'complicated', 'emotional', 'structure', 'make', 'Rabbit', 'Hole', 'much', 'more', 'poignant', 'gripping', 'film', 'usual', 'melodramatic', 'fare', 'type', 'story', 'Linday-Abaire', ""n't"", 'avoid', 'opportunities', 'humor', 'telling', 'story', 'used', 'great', 'effect', 'scene', 'where', 'Eckhart', 'Oh', 'attend', 'group', 'stoned', 'hilarious', 'context', 'film.Meanwhile', 'Mitchell', 'substantial', 'range', 'director', 'previous', 'two', 'films', 'were', 'preoccupied', 'sexual', 'element', 'relationships', 'here', 'perceptive', 'talent', 'capturing', 'emotional', 'element', 'as', 'well', 'great', 'justice', 'material', 'way', 'too', 'example', 'what', 'mean', 'never', 'see', 'hear', 'son', 'death', 'only', 'expressions', 'Becca', 'Jason', 'powerful', 'scene', 'only', 'body', 'language', 'actors', 'graceful', 'cinematography', 'illustrate', 'pivotal', 'event', 'shooting', 'scene', 'manner', 'rather', 'showing', 'boy', 'death', 'much', 'more', 'affective.The', 'film', 'concludes', 'nicely', 'ending', 'sappy', 'optimism', 'bleak', 'misery', 'up', 'poignant', 'hopeful', 'note', 'not', 'predictable', 'one', 'have', 'seen', 'film', 'twice', 'believe', 'one', 'best', 'films', '2010', 'acting', 'piece', 'under-appreciated', 'actors', 'really', 'showcase', 'talent', 'backed', 'deeply', 'felt', 'script', 'sensitive', 'direction', 'gritty', 'emotional', 'realism', 'film', 'Blue', 'Valentine', 'none', 'original', 'impact', 'second', 'viewing', 'said', 'glimmer', 'hope', 'characters', 'film', 'bit', 'downer', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'watching', 'again', 'Do', ""n't"", 'let', 'dissuade', 'seeing', 'though', 'one', 'most', 'powerful', 'emotionally', 'effective', 'dramas', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'recently.GRADE', 'A-']",Rabbit Hole

It centers on how two parents cope with the grief of loosing their 4 y/o son in a tragic car accident. Nicole Kidman is wonderful as the grieving mother who tries to deal with her sons death by erasing his presence. Aaron Eckhart is outstanding as the father who wants to remember his son and move on with his life. Young actor Miles Teller holds his own with two veteran actors as the driver of the car that killed their young son.

1393330,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B004AE3QY4,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[114, 120]","When I heard that John Cameron Mitchell, the mad genius behind the explosive ""Hedwig and the Angry Inch,"" (which he wrote, directed and starred in) was taking the directing chores on an upscale adaptation of a Pulitzer Prize winning play--I thought to myself, this could be interesting. Mitchell, however, shows incredible restraint with ""Rabbit Hole""--a searing drama about loss and survival. While opening up the play with this film version, he really didn't have to stray too far from the exquisitely moving source material. Playwright David Lindsay-Abaire was on hand to bring his own words to the big screen, and Mitchell puts his trust in those words! But beyond that, a cast led by Nicole Kidman and Aaron Eckhart lend this piece a real life urgency and poignancy. Although infused with sadness, ""Rabbit Hole"" achieves its quiet power in depicting our choice to live--even when all our instincts tell us otherwise.In short, ""Rabbit Hole"" is a survivor's story. Set eight months after a tragic accident that claimed the life of their son, the film introduces us to Kidman and Eckhart as the coping parents. Still reeling, and remaining somewhat isolated, they exist on a day to day basis. Each, in their own way, is ready to move on--but they just need the catalyst to do so. Neither, however, can truly fulfill the needs of their partner. While understanding the nature of the accident, each still battles with their personal guilt in what happened and it has put an undeniable strain on their marriage. Kidman forges an uneasy relationship with the teenager who actually ran over their son, while Eckhart has a tentative flirtation and easy camaraderie with another member of a grief counseling support group. They are seeking an outlet that they can't or won't get from one another.""Rabbit Hole"" has painfully vivid and impassioned segments. And yet, its truth lies in all the quiet moments in the search for meaning, understanding, and connection. The picture is incredibly well-balanced and is every bit as much about life as it is about death. There's wisdom, wonderment, and even humor in this delicate and precise screenplay. Nicole Kidman is absolutely superb and every emotion can be seen behind her eyes. Eckhart (generally underrated in my opinion) matches her intensity more outwardly, but no less effectively. Great support is provided by the supporting cast--Dianne Wiest, in particular, as Kidman's mother has a kooky dignity. But Sandra Oh (from the support group), Tammy Blanchard (Kidman's sister) and Miles Teller (the guilty teenager) all provide stellar moments.""Rabbit Hole"" is not above asking the difficult questions and making Kidman and Eckhart unique in the pursuit of their own truths. The screenplay never asks us to love this couple--only to understand them. Presenting them, flaws and all, is what makes ""Rabbit Hole"" such a compassionate piece--one in which it's easy to identify with their pain, conflicts, guilt and resiliency. I loved the simplicity, earnestness, and even the unexpected humor in this film. Great truthful words brought out by a top notch cast--""Rabbit Hole"" is a terrific film.

This isn't the case for John Cameron Mitchell's Rabbit Hole, however.Nicole Kidman and Aaron Eckhart play Becca and Howie, a couple who lost their four year old son, who was killed in a car accident eight months prior to when the film takes place. Becca is an ex-executive who became a stay-at-home mom, and Howie still goes to work. They learn to grieve in different ways, including making small-talk with the driver of the car that killed their son, smoking weed before group grief meetings, engaging in questionable behaviour, and doing anything they can to move forward in their lives.The one special thing about this film, is that it always knows what it is, and it saves itself from unbearable sentimentality, sap, and melodrama. However, thanks to its tough, yet sensitive script and direction, and impeccable performances, and much-needed moments of black comedy, it saves itself from drowning. You feel, as the viewer, as if you've known these characters for years. They give you a sense of familiarity that makes the experience better than it would be otherwise.This film, is in no way speaking, a documentary, however, it is so real, honest, and emotionally gritty, to make even the most cynical viewer feel the emotions that the characters are going through. The direction, nailed by John Cameron Mitchell, is sensitive enough, however doesn't allow the picture to indulge in moments of extended melodrama.Rabbit Hole is based on the play, of the same name, which won Tony Awards and the Pulitzer Prize, back in 2005, by David Lindsay-Abaire, and it would be surprising, to me, if this adaptation doesn't receive the same recognition. Lindsay-Abaire, having written the screenplay, gives the film viewer the feeling that they're watching the stage production. It has the same vague staginess that 2008's Doubt had, however, like Doubt, it manages to not become obnoxious, nor pretentious.However, the real prize here, comes from the film's impeccable cast. Nicole Kidman does her best work in years. She gives a lived-in performance that makes you forget that she's Nicole Kidman. She's Becca. During a scene, where she breaks down in her car, you feel her pain, and you break down and sob with her. Kidman manages to remind the audience why she is thought of as a fabulous actress. She makes you believe that nobody else could have played this character. She is extraordinary.Aaron Eckhart is also award-caliber in this film. He doesn't have as much screen time as Kidman, however, he provides the persona of the grieving, quiet, emotionally distraught husband, quietly drifting away from the life that he once had. Dianne Wiest is a shoo-in for best supporting actress this year, playing Becca's mother. She, and fellow cast member, Sandra Oh, bring comic relief when the film needs it the most, and, like the other cast members, you are lead to believe that no other actor could have played them.In short, Rabbit Hole is surely one of the best films I've seen in 2010. Its depressing premise isn't all it sounds to be. It is a film that is filled with hope, black comedy, reality and perception.

1393346,A2WFBIPVZFYDL5,B004AE3QY4,"Randal Rauser ""The Tentative Apologist""","[0, 0]","The other day somebody advised me to watch the film &#8220;Courageous&#8221;. I took their advice. Partially.We started to watch the film. But then forty-five minutes into it we realized that Jon Stewart&#8217;s &#8220;The Daily Show&#8221; was about to begin. So&#8230;In other words, the film suffered from the most devastating of cinematic crimes: mediocrity. It wasn&#8217;t good enough to draw our minds into its world and away from the nightly TV listings, and it wasn&#8217;t bad enough to keep us hooked with its sheer awfulness. Rather, its script and acting felt like it was about the level of an average sitcom without the laugh track (and, save, one scene, without the laughs as well).And that is not all. &#8220;Courageous&#8221; is a Christian film. And &#8220;Christian film&#8221; is typically code for &#8220;overtly didactic&#8221;. This was no exception. In the portion I saw characters in the film repeatedly stressed the need for fathers to be good fathers to their children. The script-writing was so ham-fisted I half expected the actors to look directly into the camera as they were delivering their hortatory lines. In fact, the film felt like an elaborate Campus Crusade for Christ skit on fatherhood. Subtlety is definitely not the strong suit of evangelicals.The central event in the portion of the film I watched is the untimely death of a beloved daughter in a car accident and the father learning to deal with his grief. As I mused about how poorly this was presented I was led to reflect on another film which covers some of the same ground. &#8220;Rabbit Hole&#8221; came out two years ago. It is a fantastic film, but along with &#8220;Buried&#8221; and &#8220;United 93&#8243; it is one of the heaviest films I have watched in the last five years. The sense of desperate grief is stifling.The film stars Nicole Kidman as Becca Corbett in an Oscar nominated performance. Becca&#8217;s husband (played by Aaron Eckhart) is desperate to reach out to her and save their marriage. But daily both bereaved parents are being water-boarded by their own guilt, and their seething rage at the other. This family is gripped by so much pain that even now I find a sense of anxiety settling in just to recall it. In &#8220;Courageous&#8221; God is the sometimes-hard-to-understand-but-always-quietly-abiding-benevolent-presence. In &#8220;Rabbit Hole&#8221; he is a cause of skepticism and unvarnished outrage. Not surprisingly I resonate better with the theology of &#8220;Courageous&#8221; but in terms of a depiction of agonizing loss, &#8220;Rabbit Hole&#8221; is the truer film by light years.As I pushed stop on the control I mused over the fact that &#8220;Courageous&#8221; received an outstanding A+ Cinemascore from its audience. I must say that didn&#8217;t impress me. After all, if you survey people who had just purchased &#8220;two buck Chuck&#8221; (Charles Shaw Winery&#8217;s fabled two dollar bottle of wine) I guarantee you&#8217;d get a disproportionately high grade. Not surprisingly that is widely reflective of the expectations and demands of the customer base. Charles Shaw markets to an audience that is satisfied with a two dollar bottle of wine. And &#8220;Courageous&#8221; is marketed to an audience that is satisfied with a two hour Campus Crusade for Christ skit. Fair enough. It is a free country.What bothers me is not that people pour themselves a glass of two buck chuck. Rather, it is that they think they aren&#8217;t missing something when they bypass the (still very reasonably priced) Penley Estate Cabernet Sauvignon. By the same token, it doesn&#8217;t bother me that some people like watching films like &#8220;Courageous.&#8221; And if that spurs them on to be better parents then all the better. But if they choose it instead of a film like &#8220;Rabbit Hole&#8221; they do so at their own loss.randalrauser.com",5,A true portrait of grief and loss,1389052800,"01 7, 2014",2014,3880,"['other', 'day', 'somebody', 'advised', 'watch', 'film', '8220', 'Courageous', '8221', 'took', 'advice', 'Partially.We', 'started', 'watch', 'film', 'then', 'forty-five', 'minutes', 'realized', 'Jon', 'Stewart', '8217', '8220', 'Daily', 'Show', '8221', 'was', 'begin', 'So', '8230', 'other', 'words', 'film', 'suffered', 'most', 'devastating', 'cinematic', 'crimes', 'mediocrity', 'wasn', '8217', 'good', 'enough', 'draw', 'minds', 'world', 'away', 'nightly', 'TV', 'listings', 'wasn', '8217', 'bad', 'enough', 'keep', 'hooked', 'sheer', 'awfulness', 'Rather', 'script', 'acting', 'felt', 'was', 'level', 'average', 'sitcom', 'laugh', 'track', 'save', 'one', 'scene', 'laughs', 'as', 'well', '.And', 'not', '8220', 'Courageous', '8221', 'Christian', 'film', '8220', 'Christian', 'film', '8221', 'typically', 'code', '8220', 'overtly', 'didactic', '8221', 'was', 'exception', 'portion', 'saw', 'characters', 'film', 'repeatedly', 'stressed', 'need', 'fathers', 'be', 'good', 'fathers', 'children', 'script-writing', 'was', 'so', 'ham-fisted', 'half', 'expected', 'actors', 'look', 'directly', 'camera', 'were', 'delivering', 'hortatory', 'lines', 'fact', 'film', 'felt', 'elaborate', 'Campus', 'Crusade', 'Christ', 'skit', 'fatherhood', 'Subtlety', 'definitely', 'not', 'strong', 'suit', 'evangelicals.The', 'central', 'event', 'portion', 'film', 'watched', 'untimely', 'death', 'beloved', 'daughter', 'car', 'accident', 'father', 'learning', 'deal', 'grief', 'mused', 'how', 'poorly', 'was', 'presented', 'was', 'led', 'reflect', 'film', 'same', 'ground', '8220', 'Rabbit', 'Hole', '8221', 'came', 'out', 'two', 'years', 'ago', 'fantastic', 'film', '8220', 'Buried', '8221', '8220', 'United', '93', '8243', 'one', 'heaviest', 'films', 'have', 'watched', 'last', 'five', 'years', 'sense', 'desperate', 'grief', 'stifling.The', 'film', 'stars', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'Becca', 'Corbett', 'Oscar', 'nominated', 'performance', 'Becca', '8217', 's', 'husband', 'played', 'Aaron', 'Eckhart', 'desperate', 'reach', 'out', 'save', 'marriage', 'daily', 'bereaved', 'parents', 'are', 'being', 'water-boarded', 'own', 'guilt', 'seething', 'rage', 'other', 'family', 'gripped', 'so', 'much', 'pain', 'even', 'now', 'find', 'sense', 'anxiety', 'settling', 'just', 'recall', '8220', 'Courageous', '8221', 'God', 'sometimes-hard-to-understand-but-always-quietly-abiding-benevolent-presence', '8220', 'Rabbit', 'Hole', '8221', 'cause', 'skepticism', 'unvarnished', 'outrage', 'Not', 'surprisingly', 'resonate', 'better', 'theology', '8220', 'Courageous', '8221', 'terms', 'depiction', 'agonizing', 'loss', '8220', 'Rabbit', 'Hole', '8221', 'truer', 'film', 'light', 'years.As', 'pushed', 'stop', 'control', 'mused', 'fact', '8220', 'Courageous', '8221', 'received', 'outstanding', 'A+', 'Cinemascore', 'audience', 'must', 'say', 'didn', '8217', 'impress', 'survey', 'people', 'who', 'had', 'just', 'purchased', '8220', 'two', 'Chuck', '8221', 'Charles', 'Shaw', 'Winery', '8217', 'fabled', 'two', 'dollar', 'bottle', 'wine', 'guarantee', '8217', 'd', 'get', 'disproportionately', 'high', 'grade', 'Not', 'surprisingly', 'widely', 'reflective', 'expectations', 'demands', 'customer', 'base', 'Charles', 'Shaw', 'markets', 'audience', 'satisfied', 'two', 'dollar', 'bottle', 'wine', '8220', 'Courageous', '8221', 'marketed', 'audience', 'satisfied', 'two', 'hour', 'Campus', 'Crusade', 'Christ', 'skit', 'Fair', 'enough', 'free', 'country.What', 'bothers', 'not', 'people', 'pour', 'glass', 'two', 'buck', 'chuck', 'Rather', 'think', 'aren', '8217', 'missing', 'something', 'when', 'bypass', 'still', 'very', 'reasonably', 'priced', 'Penley', 'Estate', 'Cabernet', 'Sauvignon', 'same', 'token', '8217', 'bother', 'people', 'watching', 'films', '8220', 'Courageous.', '8221', 'be', 'better', 'parents', 'then', 'better', 'choose', 'instead', 'film', '8220', 'Rabbit', 'Hole', '8221', 'do', 'so', 'own', 'loss.randalrauser.com']",Rabbit Hole

In any case it was a powerful play that left significant impression on me.  I was skeptical how such complex exploration of parental grief can have the same impact on the audiences when presented as a film.  However, the cast in this movie is wonderfully selected and they manage to bring internal and external conflicts that characters experience into a memorable and heart wrenching movie.Recently, I have been interested in exploring grief as emotion, because I firmly believe that unless experienced on a deep, personal level, it is sort of emotion that is not possible to describe.  It is also a stigma to talk about it and sharing it with others brings a little or no consolation.  At one point is this movie, I truly enjoyed it when actress Diane Wiest explains it that grief is like a brick.  ""You carry it in a pocket and you know it is there because it weights so much.  And it never relly goes away, it only changes it forms"".For every person, experience and dealings with grief are different although equally powerful.

I was expecting an all-out tearjerker, but what I found was a well-rounded, necessary story that just takes you to the edge of despair without sending you over.The plot, of course, concerns a couple, Becca and Howie, dealing with the loss of their perfect, innocent four-year-old son. It explores the anguish, grief, and blame that the main characters and several peripheral characters deal with when confronted with the loss of a child. The most interesting point of view, in my opinion, is that of the teenager who accidentally killed the boy. His interaction with Becca is deeply affecting. He is of course dealing with his own feelings of self-blame, but at the same time, in some way offers Becca consolation. He is both the cause of her current torturous state, but, ironically, also the source of her inner comfort.Other interesting parallels are drawn between Becca and her own mother, who lost an adult child years past but in a less innocent way, and the parallel between Becca and her sister, Izzy, who lives what may be deemed an iresponsible lifestyle and who ironically becomes pregnant.

Are you one of the few who bothered to go and see it? If not, is it worth checking out on Blu-ray?The subject matter is the likely reason for the film being largely ignored. The title doesn't give away much either. This is not another live action version of Alice in Wonderland. Rabbit Hole is about one of the worst things that could happen to parents; it deals with the loss of a child. That doesn't sound like a fun watch, does it?The film completely surprised me and I thought it was superbly done.We aren't told at the outset that Becca (Kidman) and Howie (Eckhart) have suffered a loss. The writing respects the audience and lets us observe their actions. Becca turns down a dinner invitation from a neighbor and doesn't seem too happy when she discovers her sister is pregnant. Howie views a video of a child on his phone and we soon find out that their 4-year-old boy died eight months previously.Becca is reminded of her loss everywhere she looks. Some of Danny's pictures are still on the fridge; his room looks like it hasn't been touched and she can see his fingerprints around the house. His clothes are still in the wardrobe so she decides to give them away. After removing the pictures, she informs Howie that she thinks they should sell the house as it's another constant reminder.We learn that Danny was run over by a car when chasing his dog into the street. The unfortunate dog is sent to live with Becca's mother (Wiest).Becca rejects all of Howie's romantic advances because she presumably fears that it could result in another child that she might also lose. When she sits in the park or goes to the store, there are happy children everywhere. Imagine having to deal with that. She virtually shuts down her life so that she doesn't have to face any situations in which she'll be reminded of her dead son.The couple regularly visits a support group made up of other parents who are dealing with a similar loss. Becca can't stand facing that and soon decides to quit. She follows a school bus one day and almost crashes while trying to keep up with it. She watches a boy get off the bus and go into his house. Who is he and why was she so intent on seeing him, but not talking to him? He has an important part to play in the story and is responsible for the film's title, but I won't reveal why here.Despite the sad subject matter, there are plenty of moments of light relief. One involves Howie visiting the support group while he's high and one of the group starts to talk about rage. I guess some things can seem hilarious when you're in that state.The story is about whether Becca and Howie will find a way to deal with their grief and move on with their lives. It seems as if they are always arguing about seemingly insignificant things as they take out their anger on one another. Each has ways of temporarily escaping the situation and it's not clear whether their relationship will survive. That question is eventually answered and the whole story tackles the subject of losing one's child in a delicate and authentic way.I haven't seen all of Kidman's roles, but it's hard to imagine her better than she is here. Eckhart also does a good job and Wiest is outstanding as Becca's mother. We get to see the characters and their relationships develop and change by the end of the film and the resolution is somehow uplifting. It's a shame that so few people saw it in the theater.Video Quality 4.5/5Due to the low budget, director John Cameron Mitchell shot Rabbit Hole digitally, but the end result looks fantastic. Detail is strong throughout and the digital image looks bright and clear. There are a few soft scenes, but there's very little to complain about. I felt very involved with the events on the screen at all times.Audio Quality 5/5The DTS-HD Master Audio 7.1 track isn't something you would choose to show off your home theater system, but it's flawless. This is a quiet film driven by dialogue. The characters reflect on their lives and there are no loud explosions or gunshots. Ambient sounds are evident during scenes in the city and in the park and there are no problems of any kind. Dialogue was crisp and clear throughout.Special Features 2.5/5Anyone wanting to know more about the film will have to listen to the commentary track. There's really not much more to indulge in if you're a fan.Commentary with director John Cameron Mitchell, screenwriter David Lindsay-Abaire, and director of photography Frank G. DeMarco.Deleted Scenes (3:07)TrailerRabbit Hole was a complete surprise to me. I expected it to be almost too sad to watch, but it's actually a well-balanced film. The story seemed very truthful, the performances are strong and the Blu-ray presentation is excellent. If you like character-driven drama that's heavy on dialogue, it's definitely worth checking out. Although I haven't revealed how things turn out, I had a sense of optimism when the credits started to roll. Don't be put off by the strong subject matter.Overall score 4.5/5",5,Rabbit Hole: An uplifting film about death,1308268800,"06 17, 2011",2011,5474,"['Rabbit', 'Hole', 'drama', 'Directed', 'John',

1393356,A10C2SBALDLKU9,B004AE3QY4,Steven Carrier,"[5, 5]","""Rabbit Hole"" is really outstanding. Here is a film that portrays grief in the most natural way possible. (Hello,Antichrist (The Criterion Collection), are you listening!?) The film never, once, falls into genre convention, melodrama or cliche. Everything feels real. Becca and Howie feel like real people. This is in large part to the excellent writing and direction, and especially from the emotionally daring and available performances from Nicole Kidman and Aaron Eckhart. Even side characters feel exactly right (Dianne Wiest, Sandra Oh, Tammy Blanchard, Miles Teller are all excellent). For as straightforward as ""Rabbit Hole"" is, it always seems risky. Maybe it's because the filmmakers let the story speak for itself. They let the characters breathe and you are gently shown their deepest, darkest feelings, letting you embrace them without judgment. ""Rabbit Hole"" really is something rare and special.I should also note that this is in fact a film by John Cameron Mitchell, the director behind such high energy films asHedwig and the Angry Inch (New Line Platinum Series)andShortbus (Unrated Edition). It's really quite something to see Mitchell create something so vastly different from his pervious work.

At first glance it appears the atheist Kidman is having more trouble coping with the loss as each parent copes with the loss in their own way, but they are on different time schedules. Early in the film Kidman's sister calls her in the middle of the night to pick her up at the police station. She was in a bar room fight with another girl. As it turns out, she is pregnant by a musician and the girl she fought with was his ex-gf, which he was still living with. At times the movie is a dark comedy.At some point it becomes time to pack the memories away and get on with your life. Kidman reaches that point before Eckhart. She leaves group therapy and does her own therapy by talking to the teenage boy who accidentally killed her son. As it turns out it is good therapy for him, as he too must learn to cope with grief. Another awkward aspect of the grief situation is how relatives and neighbors respond to the grievers. As the movie points out there are no good ways, or at least it is a fine line few people can walk as some people try too hard to be there while others don't try enough.In the movie ""The Rabbit Hole"" is the title of a comic book the teenage boy is creating. It becomes a metaphor for coping with grief as people create substitutes for their lost loved one, by visiting alternate realities in parallel universes, but they can never really go back because their love one is dead.In addition to the comic book, Kidman gets advice from her mother. She tells her that you never get over the loss, but your feelings do change. It is like carrying a brick around in your pocket. You carry it around for so long, sometimes you forget it is there. Then you reach into your pocket for something, and suddenly there it is.",5,AND THEN WHAT?,1306108800,"05 23, 2011",2011,1836,"['Kidman', 'Eckhart', 'lost', 'son', 'Danny', '8', 'months', 'ago', 'ran', 'street', 'got', 'hit', 'car', 'first', 'glance', 'atheist', 'Kidman', 'having', 'more', 'trouble', 'coping', 'loss', 'parent', 'loss', 'own', 'way', 'are', 'different', 'time', 'schedules', 'Early', 'film', 'Kidman', 'sister', 'middle', 'night', 'pick', 'up', 'police', 'station', 'was', 'bar', 'room', 'fight', 'girl', 'out', 'pregnant', 'musician', 'girl', 'fought', 'was', 'ex-gf', 'was', 'still', 'living', 'times', 'movie', 'dark', 'comedy.At', 'point', 'time', 'pack', 'memories', 'away', 'get', 'life', 'Kidman', 'point', 'Eckhart', 'group', 'therapy', 'own', 'therapy', 'talking', 'teenage', 'boy', 'who', 'accidentally', 'killed', 'son', 'out', 'good', 'therapy', 'too', 'must', 'learn', 'cope', 'grief', 'awkward', 'aspect', 'grief', 'situation', 'how', 'relatives', 'neighbors', 'respond', 'grievers', 'movie', 'out', 'are', 'good', 'ways', 'least', 'fine', 'line', 'few', 'people', 'can', 'walk', 'people', 'try', 'too', 'hard', 'be', 'there', 'others', 'do', ""n't"", 'try', 'enough.In', 'movie', 'Rabbit', 'Hole', 'title', 'comic', 'book', 'teenage', 'boy', 'creating', 'metaphor', 'coping', 'grief', 'people', 'create', 'substitutes', 'lost', 'loved', 'one', 'visiting', 'alternate', 'realities', 'parallel', 'universes', 'can', 'never', 'really', 'go', 'back', 'love', 'one', 'dead.In', 'addition', 'comic', 'book', 'Kidman', 'advice', 'mother', 'never', 'get', 'loss', 'feelings', 'do', 'change', 'carrying', 'brick', 'around', 'pocket', 'carry', 'so', 'long', 'sometimes', 'forget', 'there', 'Then', 'reach', 'pocket', 'something', 'suddenly']",Rabbit Hole

Rather, the antagonist is abstract--you could even describe it as a 'force' which the grieving parents must fight against. A force, which threatens to consume the protagonists--not in their grief, but in an overwhelming anger toward one another.Both Nicole Kidman's character 'Becca' and her husband 'Howie' (Aaron Eckhart) agree in theory that eight months after the accident, they both must 'move on'. But it's Becca who recognizes that Howie is still too angry about what happened and is unable to grieve. That's why she refuses to participate in support-group meetings, which she regards as a form of denial--the couples who participate in the groups, are merely going through the motions and are not in touch with their true feelings. Becca goes further and insists that she and Howie give up their dream house in the suburbs--that way Howie will not be able to obsess over their lost child if he's not in proximity to all those objects that remind him of their shattering loss. But Howie cannot give up those objects--at the film's midpoint, the relationship between the couple is severely tested after Becca accidentally erases a short video of their deceased son on Howie's cell phone. We can see that Howie's anger is driving Becca away from him and she resorts to doing things for herself that may bring an end to her inner turmoil (Becca, who truly wants to move on, finds Howie's anger is causing her to become angry too!).So Becca decides to test herself by approaching the 'inmost cave' of her greatest fear. That would be of course having to meet up with Jason, the teenage boy, who was driving the car that killed their son. Becca tests herself to see whether she will be consumed by her own irrational anger (after all, the boy was not actually responsible at all for the accident). As it turns out, Becca bonds with the boy, and their relationship connotes that she has moved further along than Howie, on the complex spectrum of mourning and grief. Jason's imaginative Rabbit Hole comic book, a tale of a parallel universe where this tragedy hasn't happened, brings great comfort to Becca. In a powerful scene, she's also now able to weep, as she sits in her car and watches Jason drive off with friends (in slow motion), after his high school graduation.Rabbit Hole's subplots, whether it be Becca's relationship with her mother (who also suffered a loss of a child), Becca's jealousy toward her sister now pregnant and Howie's flirtation with the now separated Gaby from the support group, only seem to be distractions in comparison with the principal dramatic moment of the film--the confrontation between Howie and Jason. How a grown man can yell at a practically defenseless teenager underscores the horrific effect the accident had on Howie's psyche. Fortunately, the blowup is cathartic, and although Howie is not willing to meet with Jason and apologize, he asks Becca to act as an intermediary--she will go to the boy and reassure him that Howie's crazy outburst was a temporary aberration and he really didn't mean what he said.So 'Rabbit Hole' must be admired for keeping one's interest despite the lack of a tangible, visible antagonist. Nonetheless, I urge everyone to read A.O. Scott's excellent review of 'Rabbit Hole' in the New York Times who recognizes that Becca and Howie are not ""grounded in any recognizable social world"". Rabbit Hole is a story of obsession (in this case, a working out of grief). Since they are so obsessed (and we as the audience are made to focus so much on this obsession), we find out little about the details of the characters' lives outside this focused conflict. Hence the portraits of the principal characters should be viewed as somewhat limited.Despite the characters' limitations, one cannot ignore the excellent performances of Ms. Kidman and Mr. Eckhardt. In the end, the performers leave us on a note of hope--the simple act of holding hands suggests that Howie is now ready to put his anger behind and move forward with Becca, toward a lasting recovery.",3,Microscopic exploration of grieving process proves illuminating despite narrow characterizations,1297296000,"02 10, 2011",2011,4414,"['***', 'review', 'may', 'contain', 'spoilers', 'outset', 'one', 'must', 'recognize', 'writing', 'film', 'couples', 'grief', 'four', 'year', 'old', 'hit', 'car', 'killed', 'quite', 'difficult', 'what', 'Hole', 'originally', 'stage', 'play', 'David', 'Lindsay-Abaire', 'attempts', 'do', 'difficult', 'precisely', 'visible', 'antagonist', 'audience', 'can', 'identify', 'Rather', 'antagonist', 'abstract', 'could', 'even', 'describe', ""'force"", 'grieving', 'parents', 'must', 'fight', 'force', 'consume', 'protagonists', 'not', 'grief', 'overwhelming', 'anger', 'one', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'character', 'husband', ""'Howie"", 'Aaron', 'Eckhart', 'agree', 'theory', 'eight', 'months', 'accident', 'must', ""'move"", 'Becca', 'who', 'Howie', 'still', 'too', 'angry', 'what', 'happened', 'unable', 'grieve', 'why', 'participate', 'support-group', 'meetings', 'form', 'denial', 'couples', 'who', 'participate', 'groups', 'are', 'merely', 'going', 'motions', 'are', 'not', 'touch', 'true', 'feelings', 'Becca', 'further', 'Howie', 'give', 'up', 'dream', 'house', 'suburbs', 'way', 'Howie', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'able', 'obsess', 'over', 'lost', 'child', 'not', 'proximity', 'objects', 'remind', 'shattering', 'loss', 'Howie', 'can', 'not', 'give', 'up', 'objects', 'film', 'midpoint', 'relationship', 'couple', 'severely', 'tested', 'Becca', 'accidentally', 'short', 'video', 'deceased', 'son', 'Howie', 'cell', 'phone', 'can', 'see', 'Howie', 'anger', 'driving', 'Becca', 'away', 'doing', 'things', 'may', 'bring', 'end', 'inner', 'turmoil', 'Becca', 'who', 'truly', 'move', 'Howie', 'anger', 'causing', 'become', 'angry', 'too', '.So', 'Becca', 'test', 'herself', 'approaching', ""'inmost"", 'cave', ""'"", 'greatest', 'fear', 'would', 'be', 'course', 'having', 'meet', 'up', 'Jason', 'teenage', 'boy', 'who', 'was', 'driving', 'car', 'killed', 'son', 'Becca', 'see', 'will', 'be', 'consumed', 'own', 'irrational', 'anger', 'boy', 'was', 'not', 'actually', 'responsible', 'accident', 'out', 'Becca', 'bonds', 'boy', 'relationship', 'moved', 'further', 'along', 'Howie', 'complex', 'spectrum', 'mourning', 'grief', 'Jason', 'imaginative', 'Rabbit', 'Hole', 'comic', 'book', 'tale', 'parallel', 'universe', 'where', 'tragedy', ""n't"", 'happened', 'great', 'comfort', 'Becca', 'powerful', 'scene', 'also', 'now', 'able', 'weep', 'car', 'watches', 'Jason', 'drive', 'off', 'friends', 'slow', 'motion', 'high', 'school', 'graduation.Rabbit', 'Hole', 'subplots', 'be', 'Becca', 'relationship', 'mother', 'who', 'also', 'suffered', 'loss', 'child', 'Becca', 'jealousy', 'sister', 'now', 'pregnant', 'Howie', 'flirtation', 'now', 'separated', 'Gaby', 'support', 'group', 'only', 'seem', 'be', 'distractions', 'comparison', 'principal', 'dramatic', 'moment', 'film', 'confrontation', 'Howie', 'Jason', 'How', 'grown', 'man', 'can', 'yell', 'practically', 'defenseless', 'teenager', 'horrific', 'effect', 'accident', 'had', 'Howie', 'psyche', 'Fortunately', 'blowup', 'cathartic', 'Howie', 'not', 'willing', 'meet', 'Jason', 'apologize', 'Becca', 'act', 'intermediary', 'will', 'go', 'boy', 'reassure', 'Howie', 'crazy', 'outburst', 'was', 'temporary', 'aberration', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'mean', 'what', 'said.So', 'Hole', 'must', 'be', 'admired', 'keeping', 'one', 'interest', 'lack', 'tangible', 'visible', 'antagonist', 'Nonetheless', 'urge', 'everyone', 'read', 'A.O', 'Scott', 'excellent', 'review', ""'Rabbit"", 'Hole', 'New', 'York', 'Times', 'who', 'Becca', 'Howie', 'are', 'not', 'grounded', 'recognizable', 'social', 'world', 'Rabbit', 'Hole', 'story', 'obsession', 'case', 'working', 'grief', 'are', 'so', 'obsessed', 'audience', 'are', 'made', 'focus', 'so', 'much', 'obsession', 'find', 'out', 'little', 'details', 'characters', 'lives', 'focused', 'conflict', 'Hence', 'portraits', 'principal', 'characters', 'should', 'be', 'viewed', 'somewhat', 'characters', 'limitations', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'ignore', 'excellent', 'performances', 'Ms.', 'Kidman', 'Mr.', 'Eckhardt', 'end', 'performers', 'leave', 'note', 'hope', 'simple', 'act', 'holding', 'hands', 'Howie', 'now', 'ready', 'put', 'anger', 'move', 'forward', 'Becca', 'lasting', 'recovery']",Rabbit Hole
1393364,A3QMJMTLJC34QC,B004AE3QY4,"Vincent E. Martin ""Darkbard""","[2, 3]","Bottom-Line:  ""Rabbit Hole"" is a smartly written, superbly acted and well worth the discovery.  Now this is Oscar material!Life has few rules it is honored bound to adhere to.  I have heard it said over and over again we--parents--should not survive our children.  Why?  Where is it written? Who said?  Who, or what degreed it so; certainly not life?  But when it happens, when our children die before us, how then do we--the parents, the adults--deal with the empty hole, the grief, the sorrow, the guilt left in deaths' wake?Such question s and many more are posed, but never fully answered in ""Rabbit Hole"" (2010) staring Nicole Kidman (Moulin Rouge, The Hours, Eyes Wide Shut) and Aaron Eckhart (The Dark Knight, Battle: Los Angeles, Towelhead) as Becca and Howie the grieving parent of a four-year-old boy killed after his dog runs into street and struck by a car driven by Jason (Miles Teller).The StoryDirected by John Cameron Mitchell (Hedwig and the Angry Inch, Shortbus, Girl 6), Rabbit Hole, which is based on a play by David Lindsay-Abaire, opens on the couple eight months after the death of their child.  They are not coping well; each is trying to figure out how to cope with the loss.  They have joined a support group and befriend Gaby (Sandra Oh ~ Grey's Anatomy, Sideways, Hard Candy) and Rick (Jon Tenney ~ The Closer, Beverly Hills Cop II).  But Becca soon tires of the group and stops going, and Rick leaves Gaby, leaving Howie and Gaby to form a closer relationship.Meanwhile Becca's sister Izzy (Tammy Blanchard ~ The Good Shepherd, Bella) turns up pregnant by her musician boyfriend Auggie (Giacarlo Esposito ~ The Usual Suspects, Smoke, Do The Right Thing).  And Gaby and her mother Nat (Dianne Wiest ~ I Am Sam, Edward Scissorhands, The Lost Boys) are continually at odds...My ThoughtsThere is a telling scene in ""Rabbit Hole,"" wherein the couple is at a grief support group and another member quips that the reason her children was taken is so that God could create another Angel.  Kidman's character's Becca take exception to that and asks why God would need to take her son in order to make an Angel; isn't he God after all, and couldn't he create all of the Angel's he needed without taking her son and causing her co much grief?The scene is central and that is point out there is no playbook when It comes to handling grief, there is not playbook, we all handle it in our own way, some successfully, some not so successfully.Rabbit Hole, which is vivid, emotionally powerful, but ultimately hopeful--at least I found it hopeful--may prove too depressing for some, while other may find it cathartic.  Both Kidman and Eckhart do a masterful job of relating the pain and sort of life-in-limbo spell a premature death can give birth to.  Both characters gingerly and painfully step towards some sense of normalcy throughout the film.Becca seeks to come to grips with her loss by connecting with the teenager whose hit her son with his car, befriending him as a way to make sense of it all, while Howie is deeply angry but has not viable place to direct it.  Although they share the same sphere of sorrow, they are disconnected from each other, intimacy is missing as is love-making, but they still love one another enough to stay together and try to put their lives back together again.Rabbit Hole does not attempt to cover ground already well-trod; instead we are given a glimpse of two lives ripped apart by grief, rage and unimagined sorrow, but instead of trying to fix what is wrong with the couple, we are taken inside their lives as they struggle to move past their loss onto the next part of their lives.  Neither quite knows how to get there and Rabbit Hole does attempt to tell us how, because there is no magic formula, no shinny pill, no life plan that will fix it.Regrettably Rabbit Hole has an all too short run at the box office; too bad, because this is the sort of adult film that is sorely missing from the American cinematic landscape.  Rabbit Hole is a smartly written, superbly acted and well worth the discovery.

1393367,AP1WE2DB14IL1,B004AE3QY4,"Whitt Patrick Pond ""Whitt""","[36, 41]","Rabbit Hole is not the sort of movie that people generally pick as something to watch as it deals, in fairly unflinching terms, with an issue most people hope they'll never face: what happens to people after the loss of a child. It is, I think, a good thing then that Rabbit Hole has some big-name actors - Nicole Kidman, Aaron Eckhart, Dianne Wiest - who may attract people's attention to the film, because it is very much worth seeing.Becca (Kidman) and Howie (Eckhart) Corbett are a married couple in pain due to the loss of their only child, Danny, who died eight months ago when he ran out into the street and got hit by a car. They're attempting to cope but not doing very well at it, and in fact their attempts to cope are driving them apart. Becca's way of coping is in trying to escape from her grief and from the memories, avoiding anything that reminds her of Danny, while Howie clings to his grief and to everything that does remind him of Danny. And if these strains were not enough, there are the additional strains of dealing with family and friends. Becca's mother, Nat (Wiest), trying to be helpful by sharing her own experience of loss of a son ends up alienating Becca who deeply resents the comparison. Becca's sister Izzy (Tammy Blanchard), who's rather immature and involved with a married man, reveals that she's pregnant, provoking more resentment from Becca. And Becca's best friend is avoiding her, simply because she has no idea what to say and Becca resents this and refuses to reach out.Even when trying to work through their loss by attending a support group, Becca and Howie's difference still pull them apart. Becca can't stand the group and gets to the point where she lashes out at another couple's attempting to find solace in religion, while Howie feels that sharing the grief makes it better. A foreshadowing of the dangers of their differences is in another couple in the group, Kevin (Stephen Mailer) and Gabby (Sandra Oh), who've been coming to the group for eight years but who end up splitting up because Kevin wants to move on and Gaby, like Howie, can't let go.One particularly interesting development in the film comes when Becca sees a high school student on a bus and ends up following the bus to see where he gets off. Why? Does he bear some resemblance to her son, does she see in him the young man he might have grown up to be? But as the film progresses, we learn that the student, Jason (Miles Teller) was the driver of the car that hit her son when he ran into the street. Becca ends up meeting with him and talking in the park, looking for what even she doesn't seem to know. But it ultimately leads her to a cathartic moment when she sees him going to his senior prom and breaks down in tears in her car, finally giving in to, and coming to terms with, her grief.And Howie too comes to his cathartic moments, though more in stages. One blackly comic one is when he and Gaby (after her husband has left her) get stoned in her car before going in to the support group and end up giggling hysterically when another member of the group is trying to share. Another heart-breaking one comes when Becca and Howie put the house up for sale and Howie makes the ghastly mistake of trying to show a young couple the house, including his son's room, where he ends up having to tell them what happened to his son, immediately ruining any chance of their buying the house. But the final one comes where Howie is on the edge of beginning an affair with Gaby, but finds that, no matter what, he cannot bring himself to give up on Becca.The performances by the actors are all excellent, but two in particular stand out.  Nicole Kidman and Dianne Wiest both richly deserve Oscar nominations for their performances, showing how hard it is to deal with that kind of loss while at the same time showing how it is possible (though the film never makes it easy or simplistic) to find a way, and that there is no one-way-fits-all solution; that each individual has to find what works for them and that you have to accept that others have to find their own way.  One of the best scenes, where Wiest truly shines, is where Becca and Nat finally make a connection on shared loss:Becca: ""Does it ever go away? ""Nat: ""No, I don't think it does. Not for me, it hasn't - has gone on for eleven years. But it changes though.""Becca: ""How?""Nat: ""I don't know... the weight of it, I guess. At some point, it becomes bearable. It turns into something that you can crawl out from under and... carry around like a brick in your pocket. And you... you even forget it, for a while. But then you reach in for whatever reason and - there it is. Oh right, that. Which could be awful - not all the time.
