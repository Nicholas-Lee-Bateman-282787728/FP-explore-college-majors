16006,ATDE9JYCPI0L1,0767821505,Alyssa A. Lappen,"[5, 7]","This is an unimpressive film about an unimpressive character who draws prodigiously and has unaccountably grown famous enough to create New Yorker covers.The documentary probably gives an accurate assessment of Robert Crumb's life. But until Crumb graduated to New Yorker covers---a period not discussed here---neither his life nor his ""art"" were much to write home about.As a former editor of Mother Jones put it, Crumb lives in an ""arrested juvenile state,"" with an ""arrested juvenile vision,"" as represented for example by his comic, Joe Blow, an ""over the line satire,"" about a ""1950s American family in denial,"" but simultaneously a ""self indulgent fantasy,"" a descent into pornography, in which the imagined father commands his daughter to perform oral sex, while his wife dresses in a sadomasochistic costume, and whose ""Leave it to Beaver"" son tells Mom off. The deadbeat Dad ends up saying ""we should spend more time with kids.""The film includes some real-people scenes of questionable taste; In one, Crumb joins a semi-naked lady in lewd positions. Then there are camera shots of Crumb's pornographic comics. How titillating (not).Additionally, you've got the off-color comments of porno magazine editor Dian Hanson, on Crumb's personal sexual activity. How, pray tell, is this relevant to his art?Crumb may have graduated to New Yorker covers.

On one end, Crumb comes off as an amusing and likeable eccentric (you almost want to break out in laughter at his appearance when he first comes onscreen, but he kind of grows on you as the film proceeds). Much has been said about his family in this film and I have nothing new to add to that. But as we get into the outrageously crude racism of Crumb's work (I for one have never been fond of his depiction of Blacks) and the outlandish sexism of his work and personality, he begins to turn you off. One can only wonder how his wife Aline (who comes across as rather appealing) tolerated the scenes where he cavorts with the Leg Show models. We also get a bit TOO MUCH INFORMATION in regards to he and his brohters' sex fantasies.

16010,A1PASRZ81DY9C,0767821505,Austin Somlo,"[1, 1]","Viewed: 8/06Rate: 98/06: Crumb is a very good original documentary about eccentric people. Of course, they are normal, in a sense of a way, but extremely abnormal to most people. Crumb gives the most intelligent speaking picture I have seen in a long time because not very many films match the level of English spoken by the Crumbs brothers, and interestingly, at the same time, the whole thing was unscripted. Surely, one might find Crumb a pointless picture about dweebs while being envious about the obvious parts of the picture, but I saw Crumb a wisdom-thinking picture because actually what the philosophical meanings came out from, it's all true and pertinent of how the world is shaped. Meanwhile, it was fascinating to see the comics that Robert Crumb plus what his two brothers have done in the past, and it's a very integral portion of the picture. At times, it is filled with humor, but it's mostly straight-forward stuff. Never boring, Crumb is a great picture to watch because it's absolutely lucid and permeable. I wouldn't hold Robert Crumb as a martyr in any way, but instead, I think of him as a man who made use of his abilities and did the best to fulfill his life. Something like that is a good way of showing the others that they can do the same as well despite the obvious parts not up to standards.

So... they aren't that underground anymore.This movie is not what I expected. I watched it before American Splendor, but the people who assume just because they both made comics together 'theez movie$ r teh awesome, about undergrnd comix-orz, both da same!!!!1!' and every one had some stupid listmania thing with these two and ghost world. However, this is nothing like either of these movies.If you liked Capturing the Friedmans, or the dynamic between the family in Royal Tenenbaums, Crumb will fascinate.You might just become fascinated by all the strange happenings in his life. He isn't normal or sane. His family is disturbing. He cheats on his wife, and when asked how she deals with his fooling around with other women, she says 'I fool around with other men.' No one who knows him is safe from insanity.This guy has always amazed me. His comics are funny, seemingly harsh, but secretly, in my mind, some of his sick desires are appealing to me. His family dynamic is as twisted as his comics, and though he is an introverted bookish man, his oldest brother is a narcissistic maniac who you can't help but feel sorry for him, His Younger brother is a seemingly slow witted man, but is actually living the life of a monk or yogi, meditating and begging, and living in poverty.The movie covers Crumbs life and career, and his current situation (at least, current in 99). It explains how he had taken some 'LSD', although he assumes thats not what it was, because it has permantly affected his perceptionary skills. He talks about his love life, his ex-wife, and his own problems and perversions.There are no special features, just a trailer.The audio quality was decent, although when the filmographers talk to Rob or Charles, you can hardly hear them. The film is grainy, and obviously shot on super 8, or beta. It does make the movie looks like it was shot in the seventies, but because it wasn't... it makes it hard to take, especially when we are seeing lots of detailed pictures, and artwork.A weird movie, about a weird guy.Overall the movie gets 2 1/2 stars, would have gotten another star if they had edited it better, and included maybe a little bit of director interviews, or anything.

16013,A34PAZQ73SL163,0767821505,"Bernard Chapin ""Ora Et Labora!""","[9, 11]","Although with this statement I am not referring to the principal subject of the documentary. Robert Crumb is a man who exhibits the ability to work and love so one would have to say, despite his prevalent eccentricities, he is a functional adult. The same cannot be said about his two brothers who are extensively interviewed here. They would not seem to have been an obvious choice as Crumb does not have a great deal to do with his family anymore. Both of his brothers are deeply depressed and mentally ill. They are a sad sight to see. Crumb's mother is also in bad shape and it is implied that she doesn't like to leave the house for any reason. Hyper-sexuality seems to be a trait running through their family as one brother fantasized about molesting boys while the other was actually arrested for molesting women. The Crumb family is at times repulsive but do offer up exceptional insight into the ways of the imbalanced.As for Robert, here is a portrait of the artist emotionally stunted and disdainful of humanity in general. In fact, before leaving for France, he admitted that he was not going to miss anyone. Even his son says that he does not have much in the way of affection with which to share. That his son is able to maintain a relationship with the father is much to his own credit. His wife and he appear to have an open relationship which seems to work, but Crumb's true love is his art which is not aesthetically pleasing in the conventional sense. Yet, he is absolutely devoted to his craft and the drawings are rich with the ambiguities of his personality. I believe that the exploring of Crumb's personality within the context of his art is the principal reason why this film is so excellent.

16015,A95SF04RX9G8,0767821505,"Christopher Moyer ""moyer.privatjokr.com""","[9, 12]","Robert Crumb was the reluctant face of underground comic books between the late 1960s to the late 1980s. His comics were often controversial, mostly provocative, and always far off the beaten path, and for some reason, people identified with this, and he became rich and famous. Terry Zwigoff's documentary Crumb chooses to paint a portrait of R. Crumb the person, instead of R. Crumb the successful artist, and tries to offer some insight into the mind of a man who created some truly unique and oddball art.R. Crumb is a very strange man, so strange in fact that when he first met his wife's family, they weren't quite sure whether or not he was mentally handicapped. He is relatively reclusive and distanced a bit from reality, and this allows him to draw some really absurd and bizarre things. Throughout the film, different personalities try to offer their explanations for his work, and oftentimes they come back to his obsessions: fear of women coupled with a love of sexuality. His work also often reveals his distant nature, as he paints himself as an outsider.The heart of the film lies within Crumb's interactions with the various members of his family, most especially his brothers Maxon and Charles, who, by comparison, make Robert seem like a gregarious extrovert. Max is pretty far off the deep end, spending most of his days painting surreal art, sitting on a self-constructed bed of nails, and swallowing a long line of cloth to clean his intestines. Charles still lives with their mother, hasn't had a job in 30 years, and spends his days reading and scribbling gibberish in notebook after notebook.Crumb, the film, is stark and honest in its portrayal of the lives of these societal outcasts. Robert lives right on the edge of sanity, but his brothers have clearly dove right off of that cliff, and it's only possible to fully understand where Robert is coming from when you witness and listen to Max and Charles. They seem to have a repressed hatred for their father, who couldn't seem to accept them for who they were. All in all, it's a very good unconventional documentary that does so much more than simply speaking facts about a famous artist; it makes us sympathize with people who we'd ordinarily write off as looneys.[...]",4,"Compelling, unconventional documentary of a strange man",1110153600,"03 7, 2005",2005,2250,"['Robert', 'Crumb', 'was', 'reluctant', 'face', 'underground', 'comic', 'books', 'late', '1960s', 'late', '1980s', 'comics', 'were', 'often', 'controversial', 'mostly', 'provocative', 'always', 'far', 'beaten', 'path', 'reason', 'people', 'identified', 'became', 'rich', 'famous', 'Terry', 'Zwigoff', 'documentary', 'Crumb', 'paint', 'portrait', 'R.', 'Crumb', 'person', 'instead', 'R.', 'Crumb', 'successful', 'artist', 'tries', 'offer', 'insight', 'mind', 'man', 'who', 'created', 'truly', 'unique', 'oddball', 'art.R', 'Crumb', 'very', 'strange', 'man', 'so', 'strange', 'fact', 'when', 'first', 'met', 'wife', 'family', 'were', ""n't"", 'quite', 'sure', 'not', 'was', 'mentally', 'handicapped', 'relatively', 'reclusive', 'distanced', 'bit', 'reality', 'draw', 'really', 'absurd', 'bizarre', 'things', 'film', 'different', 'personalities', 'try', 'offer', 'explanations', 'work', 'come', 'back', 'obsessions', 'fear', 'women', 'coupled', 'love', 'sexuality', 'work', 'also', 'often', 'distant', 'nature', 'outsider.The', 'heart', 'film', 'Crumb', 'interactions', 'various', 'members', 'family', 'most', 'especially', 'brothers', 'Maxon', 'Charles', 'who', 'comparison', 'make', 'Robert', 'seem', 'gregarious', 'extrovert', 'Max', 'pretty', 'far', 'deep', 'end', 'spending', 'most', 'days', 'painting', 'surreal', 'art', 'sitting', 'self-constructed', 'bed', 'nails', 'swallowing', 'long', 'line', 'cloth', 'clean', 'intestines', 'Charles', 'still', 'mother', ""n't"", 'had', 'job', '30', 'years', 'days', 'reading', 'scribbling', 'gibberish', 'notebook', 'notebook.Crumb', 'film', 'stark', 'honest', 'portrayal', 'lives', 'societal', 'outcasts', 'Robert', 'right', 'edge', 'sanity', 'brothers', 'have', 'clearly', 'dove', 'right', 'cliff', 'only', 'possible', 'fully', 'understand', 'where', 'Robert', 'coming', 'when', 'witness', 'listen', 'Max', 'Charles', 'seem', 'have', 'repressed', 'hatred', 'father', 'who', 'could', ""n't"", 'seem', 'accept', 'who', 'were', 'very', 'good', 'unconventional', 'documentary', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'simply', 'speaking', 'facts', 'famous', 'artist', 'sympathize', 'people', 'who', ""'d"", 'ordinarily', 'write', 'off', 'looneys.', '[', ']']",N/A

DeRiemer,"[0, 1]","After all the political eye gouging this year, I felt the need for the peace and quiet of the Sixties so I put on Crumb, the documentary by Terry Zwigoff of the life of R. Crumb. Crumb is a fascinating look at a talented, amazingly off-center artist who probably epitomizes much of the Sixties counter culture. If you're old enough to remember Fritz the Cat, Mr. Natural, ""keep on truckin'"" and any number of large-bottomed women, you're remembering R. Crumb. If you remember walking into tacky head shops, past the displays of pipes, cigarette paper and psychedelic posters, to pick up a copy of Yellow Dog or Fritz the Cat, you're remembering at least part of the Sixties.He grew up in a terribly dysfunctional family, with a disconnected mother and a bully of a father. Of his siblings, his two brothers agreed to be interviewed and they appear to have grown up as strange as he. He and a brother began drawing comic books as an escape. We're all sexual creatures, but Crumb is the only kid I ever heard of who got aroused thinking of Bugs Bunny. His cartoons and comic books show what the Sixties youth revolution was all about. They were in-your-face, sexual, anti-establishmernt, ironic, funny. They were also often violent and anti-female (or at least demeaning to women). Crumb moved to France years ago with a second wife and a daughter.

16017,A3SFO2GSP5CVSM,0767821505,"Cosmoetica ""cosmoeticadotcom""","[12, 42]","Upon rewatching the film, the first thing that stands out about it is how poorly it has held up as a filmic `portrait of an artist'. In the intervening years, documentaries such as The Kid Stays In The Picture, American Splendor, and Mayor Of The Sunset Strip have used narrative and filmic techniques that make Crumb seem downright quaint and formulaic, by comparison. From the technique of highlighting the bizarre and uninteresting people that inhabit mumbling cartoonist Robert Crumb's life, to having statically placed talking head experts- such as Femininazi journalist Peggy Orenstein and Deirdre English, a former editor of Mother Jones magazine, who decry Crumb's alleged misogyny and racism, to egghead elitists like Time magazine art critic Robert Hughes who ridiculously masturbate over the most inane and puerile of Crumb's work, to ending the film with a text-laden write-up of what happened after the cameras stopped rolling, Crumb seems to be a relic from another age; which is ironic since many in the film seem to already- by then, associate him with the bygone psychedelia of the 1960s. But that's what it is- a pre-Internet ideal of the classic Junior High School approach to its subject matter. Its only deviance from formula is the deviance of its subject.... The actual film is not bad, merely adequate, which given its hype, is quite disappointing. In rewatching the film, too, there just seemed to be many moments where things were staged for effect, such as when Crumb is confronted in a coffee shop by a young female who objects to his work, and weakly defends himself by stating, `not everything is for everyone,' or when Orenstein and English pontificate against Crumb, only demonstrating their stolidity, while Hughes bloviates in his defense over minutia that Crumb does not even buy.That anyone with an intellect can take such lowbrow and transitory work with such seriousness says far more about the decline in art and critical thought than anything satirical or lampooning from Crumb's pen. Robert Crumb may be a great comic book illustrator, but he is not a great artist, for technically his work never rises to a visual sense that moves nor provokes the deepest and highest ideas and ideals, and there is no profound message, nor joy, to his work. In short, it and this film are not nearly as great as its hagiographers claim- which seems about right, for that is just like the man himself.",2,More could have been done,1221004800,"09 10, 2008",2008,2426,"['rewatching', 'film', 'first', 'thing', 'out', 'how', 'poorly', 'held', 'up', 'filmic', 'portrait', 'artist', 'intervening', 'years', 'documentaries', 'such', 'Kid', 'Stays', 'Picture', 'American', 'Splendor', 'Mayor', 'Sunset', 'Strip', 'have', 'used', 'narrative', 'filmic', 'techniques', 'make', 'Crumb', 'seem', 'downright', 'quaint', 'formulaic', 'comparison', 'technique', 'highlighting', 'bizarre', 'uninteresting', 'people', 'inhabit', 'mumbling', 'cartoonist', 'Robert', 'Crumb', 'life', 'having', 'statically', 'placed', 'talking', 'head', 'experts-', 'such', 'Femininazi', 'journalist', 'Peggy', 'Orenstein', 'Deirdre', 'English', 'former', 'editor', 'Mother', 'Jones', 'magazine', 'who', 'decry', 'Crumb', 'alleged', 'misogyny', 'racism', 'egghead', 'elitists', 'Time', 'magazine', 'art', 'critic', 'Robert', 'Hughes', 'who', 'ridiculously', 'masturbate', 'most', 'inane', 'puerile', 'Crumb', 'work', 'ending', 'film', 'text-laden', 'write-up', 'what', 'happened', 'cameras', 'stopped', 'rolling', 'Crumb', 'be', 'relic', 'age', 'ironic', 'many', 'film', 'seem', 'already-', 'then', 'associate', 'bygone', 'psychedelia', '1960s', 'what', 'pre-Internet', 'ideal', 'classic', 'Junior', 'High', 'School', 'approach', 'subject', 'matter', 'only', 'deviance', 'formula', 'deviance', 'subject', 'actual', 'film', 'not', 'bad', 'merely', 'adequate', 'given', 'hype', 'quite', 'disappointing', 'rewatching', 'film', 'too', 'just', 'seemed', 'be', 'many', 'moments', 'where', 'things', 'were', 'staged', 'effect', 'such', 'when', 'Crumb', 'confronted', 'coffee', 'shop', 'young', 'female', 'who', 'work', 'weakly', 'defends', 'stating', 'not', 'everything', 'everyone', 'when', 'Orenstein', 'English', 'pontificate', 'Crumb', 'only', 'demonstrating', 'stolidity', 'Hughes', 'defense', 'minutia', 'Crumb', 'not', 'even', 'anyone', 'intellect', 'can', 'take', 'such', 'lowbrow', 'transitory', 'work', 'such', 'seriousness', 'far', 'more', 'decline', 'art', 'critical', 'thought', 'anything', 'satirical', 'lampooning', 'Crumb', 'pen', 'Robert', 'Crumb', 'may', 'be', 'great', 'comic', 'book', 'illustrator', 'not', 'great', 'artist', 'technically', 'work', 'never', 'visual', 'sense', 'deepest', 'highest', 'ideas', 'ideals', 'profound', 'message', 'joy', 'work', 'short', 'film', 'are', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'great', 'hagiographers', 'claim-', 'right', 'just', 'man']",N/A

16019,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,0767821505,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[8, 8]","I really don't know what to make of this film.  When you first start watching Crumb, you wonder why anyone would ever want to watch something this odd, but after about twenty minutes you realize that you couldn't stop watching it if you wanted to - and you don't want to.  The world of Robert Crumb, a pioneer in the world of underground comics, is as disturbing as it is fascinating - and that is exactly what Crumb is, a documentary about the life of this man and his family.  It gives you a disarmingly honest look inside the man's mind, and I'm not sure anyone can really describe what we discover.  In all honesty, I had never heard of Robert Crumb nor seen any of his work (although Fritz the Cat does ring a bell) before - that work is eye-opening to say the least, and you get to see a lot of it during the documentary.  Much of it is misogynistic and arguably racist, so I'm sure Crumb fans and anti-fans alike will be most interested in this artist's direct insight into his work.  Crumb is a compulsive artist who draws almost constantly, and one gets the sense that it is the only thing keeping him from crossing a line into madness.This is a really strange man, basically a recluse who never seems comfortable with himself or anyone else - it's quite amazing he would allow a film crew in to follow him around for such a significant amount of time.  He's not shy about discussing any part of his life or his work, however, taking us all the way back to his childhood.  The man's artistic talents, even as a child, are undoubtedly extraordinary and certainly unique in terms of the exaggerated way he tends to draw things, especially people.  Critics on both sides discuss the demeaning, borderline sadistic manner in which he has depicted women at different times in his career, and Crumb readily admits that he has some inward hostility toward women (although he has married twice and is the father of two children).  On some issues, though, particularly when it comes to charges of racism, he tends to dance around the questions, passing some of the criticism off as an effect of his drug use in the 1960s.The most poignant aspect of the film, however, is the story of Crumb's family.  In many ways, this is a descent into mental illness - and it's poignantly tragic.  Crumb and his siblings obviously grew up in a dysfunctional family with a particularly puritan, abusive father.  His two sisters chose not to be interviewed for this film, but we do meet brothers Charles and Maxon along with Crumb's mother.  Charles still lives at home, never leaves the house, and has been dependent on medications for many years (his problems apparently include depression, suicidal tendencies, and homicidal thoughts), while Maxon (who has a record of molesting women) seems to be far too disturbed to live on his own as he does.  The interviews with Crumb and his brothers are the centerpiece of this documentary, if you ask me, and it's just a terribly sad thing to watch.Just as Crumb's comics are what they are, Crumb is who he is, as seems clear from the details of this documentary.  In some ways, he is incomprehensible and rather repulsive, yet you can't really dismiss or dislike him too much just because he's so darn fascinating and different from the rest of mankind.  I think those with an interest in psychology will actually get more out of this film than most of Crumb's fans and critics.",5,"Disturbing, tragic, depressing -- and singularly fascinating",1160352000,"10 9, 2006",2006,3408,"['really', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'make', 'film', 'When', 'first', 'start', 'watching', 'Crumb', 'wonder', 'why', 'anyone', 'would', 'ever', 'want', 'watch', 'something', 'odd', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'realize', 'could', ""n't"", 'stop', 'watching', 'wanted', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'world', 'Robert', 'Crumb', 'pioneer', 'world', 'underground', 'comics', 'as', 'disturbing', 'fascinating', 'exactly', 'what', 'Crumb', 'documentary', 'life', 'man', 'family', 'disarmingly', 'honest', 'look', 'man', 'mind', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'anyone', 'can', 'really', 'describe', 'what', 'discover', 'honesty', 'had', 'never', 'heard', 'Robert', 'Crumb', 'seen', 'work', 'Fritz', 'Cat', 'ring', 'bell', 'work', 'eye-opening', 'say', 'least', 'get', 'see', 'lot', 'documentary', 'Much', 'misogynistic', 'arguably', 'racist', ""'m"", 'sure', 'Crumb', 'fans', 'anti-fans', 'alike', 'will', 'be', 'most', 'interested', 'artist', 'direct', 'insight', 'work', 'Crumb', 'compulsive', 'artist', 'who', 'almost', 'constantly', 'one', 'sense', 'only', 'thing', 'keeping', 'crossing', 'line', 'madness.This', 'really', 'strange', 'man', 'basically', 'recluse', 'who', 'never', 'comfortable', 'anyone', 'else', 'quite', 'amazing', 'would', 'allow', 'film', 'crew', 'follow', 'around', 'such', 'significant', 'amount', 'time', 'not', 'shy', 'discussing', 'part', 'life', 'work', 'however', 'taking', 'way', 'back', 'childhood', 'man', 'artistic', 'talents', 'even', 'child', 'are', 'undoubtedly', 'extraordinary', 'certainly', 'unique', 'terms', 'exaggerated', 'way', 'draw', 'things', 'especially', 'people', 'Critics', 'sides', 'discuss', 'demeaning', 'borderline', 'sadistic', 'manner', 'depicted', 'women', 'different', 'times', 'career', 'Crumb', 'readily', 'inward', 'hostility', 'women', 'married', 'twice', 'father', 'two', 'children', 'issues', 'though', 'particularly', 'when', 'charges', 'racism', 'dance', 'questions', 'passing', 'criticism', 'off', 'effect', 'drug', 'use', '1960s.The', 'most', 'poignant', 'aspect', 'film', 'however', 'story', 'Crumb', 'family', 'many', 'ways', 'descent', 'mental', 'illness', 'poignantly', 'tragic', 'Crumb', 'siblings', 'obviously', 'grew', 'up', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'particularly', 'puritan', 'abusive', 'father', 'two', 'sisters', 'chose', 'not', 'be', 'interviewed', 'film', 'do', 'meet', 'brothers', 'Charles', 'Maxon', 'Crumb', 'mother', 'Charles', 'still', 'home', 'never', 'house', 'been', 'dependent', 'medications', 'many', 'years', 'problems', 'apparently', 'include', 'depression', 'suicidal', 'tendencies', 'homicidal', 'thoughts', 'Maxon', 'who', 'record', 'molesting', 'women', 'be', 'far', 'too', 'disturbed', 'live', 'own', 'interviews', 'Crumb', 'brothers', 'are', 'centerpiece', 'documentary', 'ask', 'just', 'terribly', 'sad', 'thing', 'watch.Just', 'Crumb', 'comics', 'are', 'what', 'are', 'Crumb', 'who', 'clear', 'details', 'documentary', 'ways', 'incomprehensible', 'rather', 'repulsive', 'yet', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'dismiss', 'dislike', 'too', 'much', 'just', 'so', 'darn', 'fascinating', 'different', 'rest', 'mankind', 'think', 'interest', 'psychology', 'will', 'actually', 'get', 'more', 'film', 'most', 'Crumb', 'fans', 'critics']",N/A

It would be difficult to have any awareness of American pop culture without being aware of his images.  Terry Zwigoff's powerful documentary chronicles Crumb's life, his work, and his family and friends with an honesty that is frequently shocking.  One may revile Crumb's work as pornographic and misogynistic (a charge that he would not dispute) or appreciate it as a fearless, honest revelation of  psychic baggage that most of us keep deeply and safely hidden, or a combination of the two, but it quickly becomes clear that such judgments are mostly irrelevant: Crumb creates what he does because he has no choice.  At a couple points in the film, he questions whether he should have committed certain images and themes to paper.  He is compelled by his own inner demons and neuroses; his art is what has saved him from falling into madness.  Interviews with his brothers, Charles and Max, show just how high the stakes were for him; Charles in particular, though highly intelligent, was extremely maladjusted and suicidal and spent much of his life in one room.

16023,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,0767821505,Dennis Littrell,"[7, 10]","Will comic book artist Robert Crumb--best known as ""R.Crumb"" of ""Keep on trucking"" fame--someday be recognized as a great American artist of the 20th century?  Will future generations speak of him in the same breath as Picasso and Michelangelo?  Is he really that good?  Is the comic book a legitimate art form?  Or is he just an ephemeral phenomenon of the American popular culture, to be placed somewhere between Andy Warhol and Tiny Tim, Thomas Kinkade and Paris Hilton?Director Terry Zwigoff in this documentary about Crumb's life and work makes a strong affirmative case.  He works hard at showing us an iconoclastic genius who, because of his own demons, was able to expose our own.  And if genius is, as somebody once said, an infinite capacity for taking pains, then R.Crumb clearly is a candidate.  Zwigoff reveals him as a man who draws and observes with an incredibly practiced (left) hand and a most penetrating eye.  His big-bottomed women with their legs of knotted muscle that so obsessed him, his black-faced jungle bunnies, like something out of a degenerate southern racist's mind, his demented tales of childish lust for sex and blood--the entire oeuvre of his work seems to cry out to us: Save me. I am sick. Stop me before I draw again.I am reminded in a sense of the bitter work of George Grosz who so effectively depicted the sleazy, gluttonous degeneration of the German middle class between the world wars.  There is the same almost juvenile need to shock and smear the bourgeoisie, to rub our faces in our animal nature, and to test the limits of what the burghers will tolerate.  Grosz wisely fled Nazi Germany and Robert Crumb has fled the United States.I wonder, could it be for similar reasons?  There is a point in Zwigoff's film where he shows us a particular comic book created by Crumb in which the story is of pornographic incest involving children.  If such a comic book were published today it would be seized by the FBI, and the artist and publishers thrown in jail.  Could it be that Crumb was ADVISED to leave the US?  I also wonder if Zwigoff is in any danger himself, having produced this documentary which shows part of the verboten action.  Will the morality police go after the film maker?  What is the statute of limitations on child pornography?On the other hand, would they dare?  The Supreme Court has defined actionable expression as being utterly without redeeming social value.  There can be little doubt that the work of Crumb and Zwigoff is of estimable value to us as a society in that it puts a mirror up to our faces so that we can see our darker, seamier side, an animalistic side that we hide with our clothes and our vehicles or sheltered behind our Venetian blinds and closed doors.  A function of the artist is to tell us what nobody else in the society will tell us.  Art is not propaganda extolling the virtues of the state or a medium to foster social cohesion or to make us feel good about ourselves.  On the contrary, art must penetrate the facade of respectability and reveal us as we really are, perversions and all.Crumb does this.  He is compelled to do this.  He takes the infinite pains to exaggerate what we look like so that we can see what we really are.  Of course society as seen through the lens of the artist is always to some extent a distortion filtered through the psyche of the artist.  In Crumb's case we can see, thanks to Zwigoff's fine work, that a dysfunctional family life, combined with a difficult experience as a child and teen, sowed the bitter seeds that would spring up in the sunshine of his accomplished adulthood.  This is why Zwigoff needed to set up his camera in the Crumb household, to show us Charles in his messiness at home still living with his mother, taking his meds and staying indoors with his rotting teeth.  And that is why we needed to see his talented brother Maxon, pathetically upon his bed of nails prior to his suicide.  And that is also why Robert Crumb's sisters declined to participate in the filming.  They knew what it would reveal.  And that is also why R.Crumb himself is reported to have hated this documentary and why he had to be dragged along to get it finished.  He was torn.  The artist in his soul wanted to see the truth of his life expressed.  The everyday Robert Crumb knew that he would regret the exposure.One thing though that I think has to be a positive for Crumb is that the film makes it clear that he is anything but a sick soul, that he is not only a wizard with his pen, but he is nobody's fool.  He comes across as geeky but intelligent and worldly wise with an ability to laugh good-naturedly at humanity's foibles.Nonetheless we hear Crumb claim that he never loved anybody--lusted after some babes, his two wives, some girlfriends, but he never loved them--until, that is, he fell in love with his daughter.  But Zwigoff gives us a hint of what that relationship is like when his camera catches Crumb bestowing a kiss upon his daughter's cheek, a kiss that she immediately wipes off as something annoying.  I think that this scene, perhaps more than any, is what R.Crumb regrets about this all too-telling documentary.My opinion: R.Crumb will indeed be recognized by future generations as a great artist.  They will look back at our times and remark how accurately Crumb captured our hypocrisy, and how he was able to project the crimes and misdemeanors of our hidden hearts onto the comic book page with a skill and originality and a brutal honesty only possible from the mind of an artist.",5,A degenerate genius?,1135036800,"12 20, 2005",2005,5541,"['Will', 'comic', 'book', 'artist', 'Robert', 'Crumb',

16024,A32YKRX63YZTDG,0767821505,Disgrunted Film Critic,"[3, 3]","Crumb takes a deeply personal look at 60's counterculture artist Robert Crumb. The film focuses upon three decades of Crumb's artwork to reconstruct his unhappy childhood, days with Zap Comix in the late 60's, `dark side' period and recent life. Interviews with him, his wife Aline, family and friends reveal the motives behind his astounding creativity. Crumb is sometimes hilarious, often depressing and always entertaining - a rare combination in a documentary film.During childhood, Crumb and his brothers Charles and Maxon found solace from their tyrannical father in comic books and drawing cartoons. Crumb escaped the mental illness that ended both his brother's careers as artists (Charles was equally as talented), but otherwise had a perfectly miserable childhood and adolescence. Socially awkward, bullied at school and rejected by women, he decided in 1962 (at age 17) to take revenge upon society `by becoming a famous artist'.In 1966, his chemically inspired `revelations of some seamy side of America's subconscious' caught the eye of a Haight Street publisher in San Francisco and Zap Comix was born. Zap was an outlet for his creative energy, which was rooted in his social difficulties. He was uninterested in money and once turned down a $100,000 contract - a huge sum of money in those days. Although identified with the hippie crowd, he could not relate to their culture: `My main motivation [for drawing] was to get some of that free love action'.After a few years of fame, he retired from Zap to express the darker side of his nature. His later work frequently contained sadistic and violent themes and was sometimes labeled as pornography by friends and critics alike. Even Crumb isn't sure of his intent: `Maybe I should be locked up and my pencils taken away from me'.Critic Robert Hughes says that in Crumb's world there are no heroes and `even the victims are comic' - ideas that don't jive with traditional American culture. But Crumb has always considered himself to be an outsider and enjoys the feeling of `being very removed or extremely separated from the rest of humanity and the world in general'. `Words fail me, pictures aren't much better' to describe his disgust with American consumerism. He now lives in France because its culture is `slightly less evil than the United States'.The film is embarrassingly candid about unhappy details of Crumb's life, such as his brothers' mental illness, experiments with drugs and ambivalent attitudes towards women. Yet it is apparent that there is no misery or violence in this man - it's all on paper.",4,candid,1205107200,"03 10, 2008",2008,2581,"['Crumb', 'deeply', 'personal', 'look', '60', 'counterculture', 'artist', 'Robert', 'Crumb', 'film', 'three', 'decades', 'Crumb', 'artwork', 'reconstruct', 'unhappy', 'childhood', 'days', 'Zap', 'Comix', 'late', '60', 'dark', 'side', 'period', 'recent', 'life', 'Interviews', 'wife', 'Aline', 'family', 'friends', 'reveal', 'motives', 'astounding', 'creativity', 'Crumb', 'sometimes', 'hilarious', 'often', 'depressing', 'always', 'entertaining', 'rare', 'combination', 'documentary', 'film.During', 'childhood', 'Crumb', 'brothers', 'Charles', 'Maxon', 'found', 'solace', 'tyrannical', 'father', 'comic', 'books', 'drawing', 'cartoons', 'Crumb', 'escaped', 'mental', 'illness', 'ended', 'brother', 'careers', 'artists', 'Charles', 'was', 'equally', 'talented', 'otherwise', 'had', 'perfectly', 'miserable', 'childhood', 'adolescence', 'Socially', 'awkward', 'bullied', 'school', 'rejected', 'women', 'decided', '1962', 'age', '17', 'take', 'revenge', 'society', 'becoming', 'famous', ""artist'.In"", '1966', 'chemically', 'inspired', 'revelations', 'seamy', 'side', 'America', 'subconscious', 'caught', 'eye', 'Haight', 'Street', 'publisher', 'San', 'Francisco', 'Zap', 'Comix', 'was', 'born', 'Zap', 'was', 'outlet', 'creative', 'energy', 'was', 'rooted', 'social', 'difficulties', 'was', 'uninterested', 'money', 'once', 'turned', 'down', '100,000', 'contract', 'huge', 'sum', 'money', 'days', 'identified', 'hippie', 'crowd', 'could', 'not', 'relate', 'culture', 'main', 'motivation', '[', 'drawing', ']', 'was', 'get', 'free', 'love', ""action'.After"", 'few', 'years', 'fame', 'retired', 'Zap', 'express', 'darker', 'side', 'nature', 'later', 'work', 'frequently', 'contained', 'sadistic', 'violent', 'themes', 'was', 'sometimes', 'labeled', 'pornography', 'friends', 'critics', 'alike', 'Even', 'Crumb', ""n't"", 'sure', 'intent', 'Maybe', 'should', 'be', 'locked', 'up', 'pencils', 'taken', 'away', ""me'.Critic"", 'Robert', 'Hughes', 'Crumb', 'world', 'are', 'heroes', 'even', 'victims', 'are', 'comic', 'ideas', 'do', ""n't"", 'jive', 'traditional', 'American', 'culture', 'Crumb', 'always', 'considered', 'be', 'outsider', 'feeling', 'being', 'very', 'removed', 'extremely', 'separated', 'rest', 'humanity', 'world', 'general', 'Words', 'fail', 'pictures', 'are', ""n't"", 'much', 'better', 'describe', 'disgust', 'American', 'consumerism', 'now', 'France', 'culture', 'slightly', 'less', 'evil', 'United', ""States'.The"", 'film', 'embarrassingly', 'candid', 'unhappy', 'details', 'Crumb', 'life', 'such', 'brothers', 'mental', 'illness', 'experiments', 'drugs', 'ambivalent', 'attitudes', 'towards', 'women', 'apparent', 'misery', 'violence', 'man', 'paper']",N/A

16026,ADL6AMKXSXILM,0767821505,Dr. Geek,"[0, 0]","For the 1995 documentary Crumb, famed underground comic artist Robert Crumb gave then unknown director Terry Zwigoff unrestricted and intimate access into his personal life. What resulted is an awkwardly funny yet sad portrait of an artist, a documentary hailed by critics upon its release - most notably Roger Ebert - yet ignored by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences during award season. As with most biographical documentaries where the subject is present at filming, Crumb familiarizes the viewer with the comic artist. Zwigoff films Crumb at a lecture as he presents the art for which he is most recognized: the ""Keep On Truckin'"" comic panel, his Fritz the Cat comic book, and his cover artwork for the Big Brother and the Holding Company album Cheap Thrills. Zwigoff, with Crumb as his guide, gives a quick rundown of his career as a comic artist, one whose work is instantly recognized even though the man behind it is not. This is all presented in a straightforward manner. But just as the film veers close to becoming flat, Zwigoff introduces Crumb's family. Zwigoff's introduction of brother Maxon and Charles, along with their mother Beatrice, adds an extra dimension to the film. Here, the documentary becomes a character study of sorts, presenting three siblings who dealt with the same traumatic childhood in different manners. With a controlling and abusive father and a mother harboring an amphetamine addiction at home and bullying at school, the three Crumb boys found an escape through fantasy-adventure films and comic books. Their outlet became their art, each Crumb brother becoming proficient in his own right. Yet that internal emotional suffering affected each brother differently. Charles, perhaps the most talented of the three, developed a fascination with child actor Bobby Driscoll that is suggested is pedophilic in nature. Unable to cope with personal demons, Charles stopped his art, becoming instead a depressive recluse straddled to medication allowing him to get by each day. Maxon developed seizures, moving out when he reached adulthood, half his days spent as a transient. And, of course, Crumb used his art as an outlet for his frustrations and fears, avoiding the sad life that engulfed his other brothers. In presenting their outcomes, Zwigoff subtly parallels each man's sexual proclivities to his art. Charles lost his sexual drive around the same time he stopped drawing. Maxon admits to molesting adult women, following them around and groping or removing their articles of clothing. That behavior is sporadic, much like his painting. Crumb's exaggeratedly sexual comics served as an outlet for his desires. These behaviors, Zwigoff suggests, surfaced during the childhood. The question of whether the boys experienced a healthy sexual upbringing hangs on the precipice of the documentary, never directly answered.Crumb's conclusion is unsatisfactory. It isn't that Zwigoff provides the viewer with some sort of closure; he does. Rather, the film raises more questions about the Crumb family than it can answer. With Robert Crumb's comics, each turned page results in a shock or giggle, demanding more of his art to better understand the artist. Zwigoff's fascinating yet slightly depressing film works much the same way",4,"Spoliers, if they can be called that when refering to a documentary, below:",1306454400,"05 27, 2011",2011,3280,"['1995', 'documentary', 'Crumb', 'famed', 'underground', 'comic', 'artist', 'Robert', 'Crumb', 'gave', 'then', 'unknown', 'director', 'Terry', 'Zwigoff', 'unrestricted', 'intimate', 'access', 'personal', 'life', 'What', 'resulted', 'awkwardly', 'funny', 'yet', 'sad', 'portrait', 'artist', 'documentary', 'hailed', 'critics', 'release', 'most', 'notably', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'yet', 'ignored', 'Academy', 'Motion', 'Picture', 'Arts', 'Sciences', 'award', 'season', 'most', 'biographical', 'documentaries', 'where', 'subject', 'present', 'filming', 'Crumb', 'viewer', 'comic', 'artist', 'Zwigoff', 'films', 'Crumb', 'lecture', 'art', 'most', 'recognized', 'Keep', 'Truckin', 'comic', 'panel', 'Fritz', 'Cat', 'comic', 'book', 'cover', 'artwork', 'Big', 'Brother', 'Holding', 'Company', 'Cheap', 'Thrills', 'Zwigoff', 'Crumb', 'guide', 'quick', 'rundown', 'career', 'comic', 'artist', 'one', 'work', 'instantly', 'recognized', 'even', 'man', 'not', 'presented', 'straightforward', 'manner', 'just', 'film', 'veers', 'close', 'becoming', 'flat', 'Zwigoff', 'Crumb', 'family', 'Zwigoff', 'introduction', 'brother', 'Maxon', 'Charles', 'mother', 'Beatrice', 'extra', 'dimension', 'film', 'Here', 'documentary', 'character', 'study', 'sorts', 'presenting', 'three', 'siblings', 'who', 'dealt', 'same', 'traumatic', 'childhood', 'different', 'manners', 'controlling', 'abusive', 'father', 'mother', 'harboring', 'amphetamine', 'addiction', 'home', 'bullying', 'school', 'three', 'Crumb', 'found', 'escape', 'fantasy-adventure', 'films', 'comic', 'books', 'outlet', 'became', 'art', 'Crumb', 'brother', 'becoming', 'proficient', 'own', 'right', 'internal', 'emotional', 'suffering', 'affected', 'brother', 'differently', 'Charles', 'perhaps', 'most', 'talented', 'three', 'developed', 'fascination', 'child', 'actor', 'Bobby', 'Driscoll', 'suggested', 'pedophilic', 'nature', 'Unable', 'cope', 'personal', 'demons', 'Charles', 'stopped', 'art', 'becoming', 'instead', 'depressive', 'recluse', 'straddled', 'medication', 'allowing', 'get', 'day', 'Maxon', 'developed', 'seizures', 'moving', 'out', 'when', 'reached', 'adulthood', 'days', 'spent', 'transient', 'course', 'Crumb', 'used', 'art', 'outlet', 'frustrations', 'fears', 'avoiding', 'sad', 'life', 'engulfed', 'other', 'brothers', 'presenting', 'outcomes', 'Zwigoff', 'subtly', 'man', 'sexual', 'proclivities', 'art', 'Charles', 'lost', 'sexual', 'drive', 'same', 'time', 'stopped', 'drawing', 'Maxon', 'molesting', 'adult', 'women', 'following', 'around', 'groping', 'removing', 'articles', 'clothing', 'behavior', 'sporadic', 'much', 'painting', 'Crumb', 'exaggeratedly', 'sexual', 'comics', 'served', 'outlet', 'desires', 'behaviors', 'Zwigoff', 'surfaced', 'childhood', 'question', 'boys', 'experienced', 'healthy', 'sexual', 'upbringing', 'hangs', 'precipice', 'documentary', 'never', 'directly', 'answered.Crumb', 'conclusion', 'unsatisfactory', ""n't"", 'Zwigoff', 'viewer', 'sort', 'closure', 'Rather', 'film', 'more', 'questions', 'Crumb', 'family', 'can', 'answer', 'Robert', 'Crumb', 'comics', 'turned', 'page', 'results', 'shock', 'giggle', 'demanding', 'more', 'art', 'better', 'understand', 'artist', 'Zwigoff', 'fascinating', 'yet', 'slightly', 'depressing', 'film', 'works', 'much', 'same', 'way']",N/A

Gentile,"[31, 31]","Robert Crumb is SO anti-social, that you almost want not to praise him or the film, as it would most likely elicit only contempt and disgust from him  at your pathetic interests. But he's such a talented, not to mention twisted (I mean that as a compliment)  artist, that you have to admire him. While his style, and his hysterical, irreverent characters, are not for everyone, his honesty pervades all his work. He's famous, but deplores the celebrity, phoniness, and notoriety that fame brings. While not exactly surly, he begrudgingly acknowledges that some people like his work, the work being created for basically his own amusement. That the work pays for his treasured relative anonymity and elusive privacy is a bitter irony. I love good documentaries, though there's not that many, and this is one of my favorites. It's just a very intrusive but irresistable visit into Crumbs little world, where his art and beloved records of the 1920's and 30's are his obsessions (along with sex),  the materialistic, vulgar society that he's forced to co-exist with of little interest to him. You also get to meet his bizarre family  who probably isn't really any more bizarre than many others. I especially get a kick out of his refusing to sign autographs in the movie, as I have a treasured copy of his ""Zap"" comix, which he inscribed to me. This is a must see film for anyone who's a fan of the creator of ""Fritz The Cat"", ""Zap Comix"", Janis Joplins ""Cheap Thrills"" famous album cover, etc... His ""R.

16034,A2BPDFR58H9575,0767821505,Galina,"[3, 3]","Robert Crumb has already been identified in the counterculture of the late 1960s and early 1970s as a creator of the cartoon characters Fritz the Cat (that was turned in a first X-rated feature animated film which Crumb passionately hates) and Mr. Natural and for cover art for Big Brother and the Holding Company's Cheap Thrills. Terry Zwigoff's documentary examines a man behind his works, his tastes, hobbies, and phobias and the forces that have contributed to producing a very original and controversial art.Director Terry Zwigoff spent six years in making the portrait of an Artist as seen by Crumb himself, his spouses, ex-girlfriends, his son Jesse, various artists and art critics, and the members of his family. Speaking of the strange and dysfunctional families, Grumb clan could definitely take a prize. Of three brothers, only Robert Crumb was able to come through his upbringing with his sanity, talent, and ability to create and to communicate still intact but at the same time, he is a man with many inner demons, sexual and psychological that he reveals and fights through his art. His two brothers, Maxon who is a confessed sex-offender and Charles who had lived all his life in his mother's house and would commit suicide one year after he gave the interviews for the film, were both gifted artists themselves but they could not leave their childhood memories of a father, an ""overbearing tyrant"" and ""sadistic bully"", and a mother who became an amphetamine addict behind them and to move on with their lives. The interviews with Charles and Maxon are devastating, shocking, and very sad. It would be interesting to listen to their two sisters but they refused to talk in front of camera for the film.The most fascinating aspect of the film is the fact that a viewer does not have to be a comic book fan or have knowledge of the counterculture or the specific cartoon characters to appreciate and admire it. I am not a comic books expert or fan. I've heard of Crumb before but only in regards to the films that also have impressed me a lot, ""Ghost World"" and ""American Splendor"". It did not stop me from realizing that the documentary about Robert Crumb, his life, his works, his struggle, his anger, his obsession with sex, his non-conformism, non-sentimentality, his rejection to do mainstream even it means saying ""No"" to making a lot of money, and his ability to look at the circumstances and deal with them with a dry humor is an amazing document which provides a thought-provoking character study and the deep psychological insight in the creative mind of an artist.",5,A powerful documentary,1182988800,"06 28, 2007",2007,2591,"['Robert', 'Crumb', 'already', 'been', 'identified', 'counterculture', 'late', '1960s', 'early', '1970s', 'creator', 'cartoon', 'characters', 'Fritz', 'Cat', 'was', 'turned', 'first', 'X-rated', 'feature', 'animated', 'film', 'Crumb', 'passionately', 'Mr.', 'Natural', 'cover', 'art', 'Big', 'Brother', 'Holding', 'Company', 'Cheap', 'Thrills', 'Terry', 'Zwigoff', 'documentary', 'examines', 'man', 'works', 'tastes', 'hobbies', 'phobias', 'forces', 'have', 'contributed', 'producing', 'very', 'original', 'controversial', 'art.Director', 'Terry', 'Zwigoff', 'spent', 'six', 'years', 'making', 'portrait', 'Artist', 'seen', 'Crumb', 'spouses', 'ex-girlfriends', 'son', 'Jesse', 'various', 'artists', 'art', 'critics', 'members', 'family', 'Speaking', 'strange', 'dysfunctional', 'families', 'Grumb', 'clan', 'could', 'definitely', 'take', 'prize', 'three', 'brothers', 'only', 'Robert', 'Crumb', 'was', 'able', 'come', 'upbringing', 'sanity', 'talent', 'ability', 'create', 'communicate', 'still', 'intact', 'same', 'time', 'man', 'many', 'inner', 'demons', 'sexual', 'psychological', 'fights', 'art', 'two', 'brothers', 'Maxon', 'who', 'confessed', 'sex-offender', 'Charles', 'who', 'had', 'lived', 'life', 'mother', 'house', 'would', 'commit', 'suicide', 'one', 'year', 'gave', 'interviews', 'film', 'were', 'gifted', 'artists', 'could', 'not', 'leave', 'childhood', 'memories', 'father', 'overbearing', 'tyrant', 'sadistic', 'bully', 'mother', 'who', 'became', 'amphetamine', 'addict', 'move', 'lives', 'interviews', 'Charles', 'Maxon', 'are', 'devastating', 'shocking', 'very', 'sad', 'would', 'be', 'interesting', 'listen', 'two', 'sisters', 'refused', 'talk', 'front', 'camera', 'film.The', 'most', 'fascinating', 'aspect', 'film', 'fact', 'viewer', 'not', 'have', 'be', 'comic', 'book', 'fan', 'have', 'knowledge', 'counterculture', 'specific', 'cartoon', 'characters', 'appreciate', 'admire', 'am', 'not', 'comic', 'books', 'expert', 'fan', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'Crumb', 'only', 'regards', 'films', 'also', 'have', 'impressed', 'lot', 'Ghost', 'World', 'American', 'Splendor', 'did', 'not', 'stop', 'realizing', 'documentary', 'Robert', 'Crumb', 'life', 'works', 'struggle', 'anger', 'obsession', 'sex', 'non-conformism', 'non-sentimentality', 'rejection', 'do', 'mainstream', 'even', 'saying', 'No', 'making', 'lot', 'money', 'ability', 'look', 'circumstances', 'deal', 'dry', 'humor', 'amazing', 'document', 'thought-provoking', 'character', 'study', 'deep', 'psychological', 'insight', 'creative', 'mind', 'artist']",N/A

Such an aura of sadness looms over the life and family of comic artist Robert Crumb.  It's only all the more depressing that this is all real.For the uninitiated Crumb is a biographical documentary on comic artist Robert Crumb.  The film covers the controversy of his art and the state that his family members live in.  His older brother Charles is a manic depressant anti-social who still lives with their mother.  He never leaves the house yet everyone in the family, including his mother, are content and fine with it.  Robert's younger brother, Max, lives his life his life out in an almost monk-like fashion including meditating on a bed of nails for hours every day.  Then there's Robert Crumb himself who has made a living on underground comics and has drawn controversy over his depictions of blacks, women, and sex.Drawing is the only thing that has kept Crumb sane.  As he says at the beginning of the film, when he is not drawing he gets ""depressed and suicidal"".  All of the Crumb brothers had awful high school experiences and that is why all three of them are the way they are.  Charles being the only one who never found a way to cope with it.What makes this documentary great is the way director Terry Zwigoff shows us Crumb.  He doesn't form an opinion on Crumb that he forces us to believe.  He just shows us the man and lets you figure out your own feelings.  This is helped by the fact that he features interactions with both people who think his art is genius and with those who think that he's a racist, misogynist, pervert.More than anything, what makes this such a striking film is the people.  There is an air of disbelief while watching it early on, seeing the behavior of these people.  Seeing a grown man piggy backing on random women is the type of thing you would only expect to see on staged reality TV.  But after a while they grow as people and you begin to care for their problems.  Then the last thirty minutes occur.  I put all of the pieces together in my head.  I now knew the people and had a good idea of who they are and why they are that way.  Then the film went from an interesting showcase of the eccentric and strange life of Robert Crumb and his family to one of extreme sadness.Crumb does something that few documentaries manage to do.  It gets you to care about what it's about.  Those are the documentaries that give you the most.  If you don't care about the topic you won't learn or get anything from it.

He was part of the underground comics movement in the late 60s and became really well known for his artwork.  This documentary takes you through his childhood, his family amd his &#34;relationships&#34; with women as he prepares for his move to Paris.  This documentary almost felt like it had two spotlights: 1) on the artist & 2) on mental health in families.I like documentaries but I found this one to be so dour, conceited and ugly.  This artist is the way he is due to his family.  The family looks like they came out of the horror film, THE HILLS HAVE EYES.  They are a complete mess and all suffer from mental illnesses due to an overbearing father and drugged up mother.  Seeing them talk about accosting innocent women in public and declaring that one brother wanted to the other was not entertaining in any way.  Seeing this family explains why the artist so f***ed in the head.  He loves and mocks the female form in his artwork and with the women he's been with.  People want to get on Hugh Hefner's case need to watch this documentary to see what a true sexist is.The only people I can recommend this to is hipsters and grunge artists.  That's the only group I can see liking this.  I'm sure that there are others but Hipsters and Grunge Artists will be his main audience.

I have read much of his material, but the few photographs I have seen don't give a sense of the man. R. Crumb is an intensely introspective man with tastes that are out of synch with he age. He loves listening to selections from his extensive collection of 1920-era blues and jazz records. And considering the sex- and drug-sodden content of his work, he is remarkably old-timey as well. His characters show their angst via a halo of sweat drops and show their abashment by hoping out of the frame, time-honored and even clich&eacute;d techniques. Crumb's dress is also out of the mainstream. He wears straw boaters or too-small fedoras with droopy suit jackets -- the same outfit he draws on his nebbishy alter-ego in his strips. If the movie shows anything, it's that the real-life Crumb is hardly different than this comic persona. That's the appeal and the repulsion of his work -- Crumb channels he twists and turns his own life and transfers them directly to the page.A surprisingly large section of the film focuses on Crumb's siblings and mother. Brother Charles is on meds for his depression and still lives in the family home, reading paperbacks over and over. Brother Maxon lives in a crumbling tenement in San Francisco and sits on a homemade bed of nails. In spite of being enormously articulate and intelligent, both are odd to the point of madness and make Robert seem utterly sane by comparison. Crumb's family life is captured at the time that he and wife Aline are packing up to move to France. Crumb's ex-wife and several girlfriends all testify to his great talent and also to his chronic weirdness. There's something delightful, hilarious and simultaneously off-putting about seeing a grown man jump on a grown woman's back for a piggy-back ride. Interviews with critic Robert Hughes, Bill Griffith (Zippy) and oher comic artists cover both Crumb's genius and misogyny.""Crumb"" does only a fair job of introducing Crumb's art, but it is wonderful in showing us Crumb the man, husband, brother and dad.

Growing up I was fascinated by the comics of the 40's and 50's. Our's was the era of Dick Tracy,L'il Abner,Pogo,Little Orphan Annie,Joe Paloka,Superman,Crime Comics,and on and on .In those days everyone,young and old,followed the daily comics or as we called them ""The Funnies"" However;they were not always funny,as a matter of fact,they were downright serious;and if the truth were really known,we probably learned more about life from the comics that from anything else,including school..Oh yeah,then there was the Pool Hall;but that was totally different educational institution. That was where you learned to take responsibility for your actions.There one learned; ""The Lesson you paid for,the Experience was free.""So,why would an old duffer like me watch and enjoy this Video so much?Well,although I'm an engineer ,I really enjoy many forms of art.I prefer Realism,Graphics,Illustration,Nature Art,and particularly the art intergal to cartoons and especially Comics.I am a big fan of Doonesbury and find Trudeau's art very interesting.Again ,so why Crumb? My interest in ""recent""  comics has fairly well waned since my local paper carries only  Doonesbury which is of interest to me. I am fascinated with the artwork we see in Fantasy and Sci Fi but I don't follow or read that.I am also fascinated with some of the illustration that the young people are doing.It is extremely good but the storyline is a disconnect with me.Don't take me wrong,I realize each new generation's taste changes.I have picked up some of Crum's books and was really taken with his artwork;and have often wondered what sort of mind would produce this sort of thing.This Video does an excellent job of showing the personality of Crum and what and why he drew the comics he did. We are given an in depth view into Crum's mind and those of the rest of the family.To say they are unusual is a great understatement.So often, we see that great artists walk to a different drummer.We also get a great insight into the enviroment where Crum lived.It is only through such a different lifestyle that provides a fertile imagination to develop.Could anyone ever believe that Crum grew up and lived in a conventional neighborhood?I was really taken by watching Crum actually drawing.The way he handles a pen and transfers ideas from his mind into images on paper ;it is simply magical.For a very personal insight into the mind of a one-of-a-kind artist;you would be hard pressed to find anything better.",5,The artist can see where others only look.,1171411200,"02 14, 2007",2007,2733,"['am', '71', 'year', 'old', 'retired', 'engineer', 'Celtic', 'background', 'Irish', 'Scotch', 'living', 'up', 'here', 'Great', 'White', 'North', '.I', 'am', 'far', 'conventional', 'spectrum', 'Crumb', 'non-conventional.I', 'have', 'been', 'fan', 'sorts', 'comics', 'kid', 'Growing', 'up', 'was', 'fascinated', 'comics', '40', '50', 'was', 'era', 'Dick', 'Tracy', ""L'il"", 'Abner', 'Pogo', 'Little', 'Orphan', 'Annie', 'Joe', 'Paloka', 'Superman', 'Crime', 'Comics', '.In', 'days', 'everyone', 'young', 'old', 'followed', 'daily', 'comics', 'called', 'Funnies', 'However', 'were', 'not', 'always', 'funny', 'matter', 'fact', 'were', 'downright', 'serious', 'truth', 'were', 'really', 'known', 'probably', 'learned', 'more', 'life', 'comics', 'anything', 'else', 'including', 'school..Oh', 'yeah', 'then', 'was', 'Pool', 'Hall', 'was', 'totally', 'different', 'educational', 'institution', 'was', 'where', 'learned', 'take', 'responsibility', 'actions.There', 'one', 'learned', 'Lesson', 'paid', 'Experience', 'was', 'free', 'So', 'why', 'would', 'old', 'duffer', 'watch', 'enjoy', 'Video', 'so', 'much', 'Well', ""'m"", 'engineer', 'really', 'enjoy', 'many', 'forms', 'art.I', 'prefer', 'Realism', 'Graphics', 'Illustration', 'Nature', 'Art', 'particularly', 'art', 'intergal', 'cartoons', 'especially', 'Comics.I', 'am', 'big', 'fan', 'Doonesbury', 'find', 'Trudeau', 'art', 'very', 'interesting.Again', 'so', 'why', 'Crumb', 'interest', 'recent', 'comics', 'fairly', 'well', 'waned', 'local', 'paper', 'only', 'Doonesbury', 'interest', 'am', 'fascinated', 'artwork', 'see', 'Fantasy', 'Sci', 'Fi', 'do', ""n't"", 'follow', 'read', 'that.I', 'am', 'also', 'fascinated', 'illustration', 'young', 'people', 'are', 'doing.It', 'extremely', 'good', 'storyline', 'disconnect', 'me.Do', ""n't"", 'take', 'wrong', 'realize', 'new', 'generation', 'taste', 'changes.I', 'have', 'picked', 'up', 'Crum', 'books', 'was', 'really', 'taken', 'artwork', 'have', 'often', 'wondered', 'what', 'sort', 'mind', 'would', 'produce', 'sort', 'thing.This', 'Video', 'excellent', 'job', 'showing', 'personality', 'Crum', 'what', 'why', 'drew', 'comics', 'did', 'are', 'given', 'depth', 'view', 'Crum', 'mind', 'rest', 'family.To', 'say', 'are', 'unusual', 'great', 'understatement.So', 'often', 'see', 'great', 'artists', 'walk', 'different', 'drummer.We', 'also', 'get', 'great', 'insight', 'enviroment', 'where', 'Crum', 'lived.It', 'only', 'such', 'different', 'lifestyle', 'fertile', 'imagination', 'develop.Could', 'anyone', 'ever', 'believe', 'Crum', 'grew', 'up', 'lived', 'conventional', 'neighborhood', 'was', 'really', 'taken', 'watching', 'Crum', 'actually', 'way', 'pen', 'transfers', 'ideas', 'mind', 'images', 'paper', 'simply', 'magical.For', 'very', 'personal', 'insight', 'mind', 'one-of-a-kind', 'artist', 'would', 'be', 'hard', 'pressed', 'find', 'anything', 'better']",N/A

Where alot of these kinds of documentaries I see tend to be filled with truly stupid surface people, Robert Crumb is not only disturbingly funny like alot of the forementioned characters, but also down to earth and intelligent. He doesn't laugh out of unawareness of how the world observes him, but he realizes it and laughs uncomfortably because he is honest about everything.  This definately presents real, complex human-relationships (or lack there-of) in a way you would think would be more usual than not. The Crumbs definately don't have a problem with talking opennly about their sexuality to say the least. However, in their unusual honesty, they're essentially more human than most of us would admit. They are wierd, but they never try to hide it; they put it out there as if we would be the wierd ones to lift an eyebrow. They've already hated themselves and accepted themselves, and they don't seem to be concerned that all their actions were on footage.  We learn that Robert's sexuallity is based largely on his comics, and that his brother Charle's sexuallity was destroyed by the little boy who starred in ""Treasure Island"". Why cover it up? I was a little shocked by the events folowing the footage, although it probably shouldn't have come as such to me. This is what most of us (if we all were perverts) would have wanted to keep secrets.

16047,A2EKSIM53L1SP5,0767821505,Jonathan Walters,"[8, 10]","As a graphic designer and sometimes-comic artist, I have always been drawn to R. Crumb's work. Although many find R's art for the most part obscene or bigoted, I am quite drawn to his work and try to look at some of his more controversial pieces in the context of social, political and personal conditions. This documentary has certainly helped to further my understanding of 'R' the person, and should not be missed by those wanting to learn more about the man behind the art.In terms of technical quality, the film is second or third rate and doesn't exude the quality of other current documentaries or quasi-documentaries such as the American Splendor film. It is obvious that the film was shot on a very low budget, but once the story gets rolling this becomes a very minor factor next to the study of Crumb himself. It does an excellent job of prying into the life of so private a man, and although by no means authoritive in scope it does give viewers a decent view into Crumb's inner workings. For the most part the film does not pass judgement, as several individuals offer their opinions of his work and on him as a person throughout the film, but the ultimate verdict (if any) is left for the viewer to decide.Some of the most insightful moments come during interviews with Crumb, his mother and his brothers, helping to flesh out a picture of Crumb's childhood and early influences. The film paints a disfunctional picture of the family, but through them Crumb's work can be better understood. Also interesting are Crumb's thoughts on the state of American culture, which are explored via several specific scenes in the film and through the process of watching 'R' and his family prepare for their move to France.Overall, this is a film not to be missed for those interested in either Crumb the man or Crumb the artist.

16048,AYCJSA9HR7TKO,0767821505,Kerry Walters,"[3, 3]","My son, who's much more attuned to the relationship between art and rebellion than I am, turned me onto this powerful film.  Of course I remember Robert Crumb's artwork--especially ""Mr. Natural""--from the late 60s and early 70s, but I knew absolutely nothing about his life.  Watching this incredible documentary not only helps me better appreciate Crumb's message.  It also makes me want to go back and re-examine as much of his oeuvres as I can get my hands on.If there's one clear message from ""Crumb,"" it's that R. Crumb is one of the most thorough-going outsiders American culture has ever produced.  Time, place, upbringing, biology, and talent all contribute to his rebelliousness.  The family in which he was raised gives new meaning to the term ""dysfunctional"":  a speed-queen for a mother (diet pills), an aloof, judgmental father, two brothers who are incredibly broken (one a manic-depressive who commits suicide a year after the film was completed, another a jittery, genuinely creepy sexual predator).  The time and place, the 60s in San Francisco, encouraged rebellion against the ""incredibly boring"" (as Crumb describes it) and spiritually dead white middle-class ethos of the 50s.  And the talent for drawing, which Crumb shares with his two whacked-out brothers, and which has been inherited by Crumb's two children, gave him an outlet for expressing his rage at what he saw (and still sees) as the hypocrisy and shallowness of American culture.But Crumb's status as an outsider goes way beyond his satiric savaging of a ""Leave It to Beaver"" 50s ethos on the one hand and the contemporary yuppie/Starbuck's one on the other.  Crumb's art also rebels against some of the sacred cows of the liberal/progressive/bohemian set.  His sexual art gestures at a rawness--and self-confessed hostility to women--that has such a shocking in-your-face honesty that it's often (mistakenly, in my view) rejected as misogynistic.  Similarly, his artwork that focuses on the black experience in this country take the ""Sambo"" stereotypes to such an extreme, presumably under the presumption that racism is so engrained in his white readers that subtlety just won't work, that many reject them (again, mistakenly) as exemplifying the very racism Crumb is lampooning.Finally, it's worth pointing out that Crumb's embrace of the outsider identity has an integrity not seen since, perhaps, Thoreau.  As the film documents, Crumb has had several opportunities to go mainstream--doing the cover of ""Rolling Stone,"" collaborating in Hollywoodish cinema animation, appearances on ""Saturday Night Live,"" and so on--all of which would've brought him big bucks and respectability.  But he turned them all down, well recognizing the cost of accepting them.  Moreover, his ultimate act of rebellion against the American ethos was becoming an expatriot in the mid-90s.  He and his family moved to the south of France, where they still live.  It takes a great deal of courage, and an equal amount of integrity, to walk the talk.  Crumb's done it all his life.",5,The archetypal outsider,1203811200,"02 24, 2008",2008,3044,"['son', 'who', 'much', 'more', 'attuned', 'relationship', 'art', 'rebellion', 'am', 'turned', 'powerful', 'film', 'course', 'remember', 'Robert', 'Crumb', 'artwork', 'especially', 'Mr.', 'Natural', 'late', '60s', 'early', '70s', 'knew', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'life', 'Watching', 'incredible', 'documentary', 'not', 'only', 'better', 'appreciate', 'Crumb', 'message', 'also', 'want', 'go', 'back', 're-examine', 'much', 'oeuvres', 'can', 'get', 'hands', 'on.If', 'one', 'clear', 'message', 'Crumb', 'R.', 'Crumb', 'one', 'most', 'thorough-going', 'outsiders', 'American', 'culture', 'ever', 'produced', 'Time', 'place', 'upbringing', 'biology', 'talent', 'contribute', 'rebelliousness', 'family', 'was', 'raised', 'new', 'meaning', 'term', 'dysfunctional', 'speed-queen', 'mother', 'diet', 'pills', 'aloof', 'judgmental', 'father', 'two', 'brothers', 'who', 'are', 'incredibly', 'broken', 'one', 'manic-depressive', 'who', 'suicide', 'year', 'film', 'was', 'completed', 'jittery', 'genuinely', 'creepy', 'sexual', 'predator', 'time', 'place', '60s', 'San', 'Francisco', 'encouraged', 'rebellion', 'incredibly', 'boring', 'Crumb', 'spiritually', 'dead', 'white', 'middle-class', 'ethos', '50s', 'talent', 'drawing', 'Crumb', 'shares', 'two', 'whacked-out', 'brothers', 'been', 'inherited', 'Crumb', 'two', 'children', 'gave', 'outlet', 'expressing', 'rage', 'what', 'saw', 'still', 'sees', 'hypocrisy', 'shallowness', 'American', 'culture.But', 'Crumb', 'status', 'outsider', 'way', 'satiric', 'savaging', 'Leave', 'Beaver', '50s', 'ethos', 'one', 'hand', 'contemporary', 'yuppie/Starbuck', 'one', 'other', 'Crumb', 'art', 'also', 'sacred', 'cows', 'liberal/progressive/bohemian', 'set', 'sexual', 'art', 'gestures', 'rawness', 'self-confessed', 'hostility', 'women', 'shocking', 'in-your-face', 'honesty', 'often', 'mistakenly', 'view', 'rejected', 'misogynistic', 'Similarly', 'artwork', 'black', 'experience', 'country', 'take', 'Sambo', 'such', 'extreme', 'presumably', 'presumption', 'racism', 'so', 'engrained', 'white', 'readers', 'subtlety', 'just', 'wo', ""n't"", 'work', 'many', 'reject', 'again', 'mistakenly', 'exemplifying', 'very', 'racism', 'Crumb', 'lampooning.Finally', 'worth', 'pointing', 'out', 'Crumb', 'embrace', 'outsider', 'identity', 'integrity', 'not', 'seen', 'perhaps', 'Thoreau', 'film', 'documents', 'Crumb', 'had', 'several', 'opportunities', 'go', 'mainstream', 'doing', 'cover', 'Rolling', 'Stone', 'collaborating', 'Hollywoodish', 'cinema', 'animation', 'appearances', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Live', 'so', 'would', ""'ve"", 'brought', 'big', 'bucks', 'respectability', 'turned', 'down', 'well', 'recognizing', 'cost', 'accepting', 'Moreover', 'ultimate', 'act', 'rebellion', 'American', 'ethos', 'was', 'becoming', 'expatriot', 'mid-90s', 'family', 'moved', 'south', 'France', 'where', 'still', 'live', 'great', 'deal', 'courage', 'equal', 'amount', 'integrity', 'walk', 'talk', 'Crumb', 'done', 'life']",N/A

16051,A1ODZ7SDUPEGNK,0767821505,"Kurt Harding ""bon vivant""","[7, 7]","When I was a teenager growing up in San Diego, R Crumb's comic books were available in every head shop. It was a lot hipper to have a stack of Crumb's work stashed away in your room than it was to have a Playboy or a Penthouse. Crumb's work was misogynistic, sexist, racist, and about as politically incorrect in every way that it could be yet it was the toast of the counterculture.I was visiting friends in Las Vegas when Crumb was first released and saw it while I was there. It made such an impression that I put it on my list of DVDs to own and finally got around to getting my copy this year.Robert Crumb is nothing if not bizarre. On watching the interviews with him, some of his family members, his friends and others around him I got the feeling that his perverted talents developed because of his dysfunctional upbringing rather than despite it. The raw talent was always there, it is just a twist of fate and mind that propelled him to fame as the foremost cartoonist of his generation.Think what you will of his subject matter, his work is undoubtedly great. Crumb taps into a vein of humor that springs from the darkest corners of his imagination and brings it to life in such a way that we can laugh while simultaneously being repelled. Nothing is taboo to Crumb, in fact he seems to revel in the most degenerate imagery. And to think that he is the most normal of the family members who were interviewed for this documentary! Incredibly, both of his brothers proved weirder than he, the one who still lived at home reminds the viewer of Goober from the Andy Griffith Show only stranger. David Lynch could hardly imagine an odder lot for one of his odder movies. (Crumb's sisters declined to be interviewed for the film, probably out of embarassment).Since I enjoy Crumb's work, I found it interesting to discover the things that made him the kind of guy he is. His awkward relations with women undoubtedly color the way he depicts them and its funny that while some of the women interviewed are appalled, others are more philosophical. The film didn't touch on his relations with blacks although his cartoons feature black characters in the crudest caricature imaginable.

Crumb, whose disturbing but funny work I'd enjoyed as a young man.A couple of weeks ago, I viewed the film again after a friend asked me to watch it with her (she'd never seen it). After this second viewing, my estimation of the movie has risen: I now believe this to be one of the best documentaries I've ever seen.Crumb is a man out of step with modern society, but he's out of step in a way that seems to work for him. His art has always stood out, and frankly, even though I like it, some of his characters border on being repellent. I think one of the great things about him is he can draw something that has you grimacing one moment and laughing your ass off the next.This movie is not without genuine pathos. Crumb's brother Charles is interviewed extensively for the film; he suffered from anxiety and depression, and while some of the things he says here are very funny, he truly was tormented, and committed suicide about a year after filming was complete. The movie is dedicated to him. Robert Crumb's other brother, Maxon, seems more spiritually grounded, but here's a warning: The scenes involving his bed of nails and a yogic purification ritual that involves swallowing a length of thin cloth will be disturbing to some.Robert Crumb's work was a significant element of 1960s and early 1970s counterculture (whatever THAT means now), and he remains a popular and influential artist.

Crumb and his family, but the man himself remains an enigma - an entertaining and fascinating enigma, but an enigma nonetheless. Still, Zwigoff's probing camera gets behind the man and his art, his fans and detractors, and delivers a wonderful portrait of the man and a great appreciation of his work - even his most off-putting, misogynistic work.But it's when Zwigoff talks to Robert's family that we see the true effects of a horrible, and horror-filled, childhood. Both of his brothers are intelligent and considerably talented, but they were unable to find a healthy outlet to escape a tyrannical father (his abuse is only hinted at in the movie), and their stories are deeply affecting - and difficult to watch.So &quot;Crumb&quot; is either life-affirming or terribly depressing.

He's fascinating.Director Terry Zwigoff gets a lot of mileage out of Crumb's reactions to situations.  Whether it's the confused and perplexed look he gets from watching the parade of shallow consumers he sees on the streets, or his half-sincere/half-uncomfortable bursts of laughter following bizarre tales from his youth, Crumb's expressive face says more than his mouth ever could.  This, combined with his wonderfully laid-back voice (at once sarcastic and self-deprecating and tinged with regret) makes me wonder why it's taken so long for this man to get some camera time.  Self-imposed exile, I suppose.  He's definitely a star.The opening sequence over the credits is the lone contrived moment in an otherwise truthful film.  It begins by showing a series of porcelain sculptures modeled on Crumb's most recognizable characters, followed by a shadowy shot of Robert, sitting in a near-fetal position, listening to one of his many old time blues records.  It is the only moment in the film that feels fake, and threatens to ruin the film's credibility right from the starting gate.  Thankfully, director Zwigoff has a perfect game the rest of the way.And there is only one moment that puts objectivity aside and allows for a bit of commentary on the part of the filmmakers.  It concerns an interview with Deirdre English, a former editor of the magazine 'Mother Jones'.  She gives her opinion (along with shown examples) of Crumb's supposed racism.  Zwigoff precedes this with footage of Crumb complaining that the only people who found these comics offensive were white liberals, e.g. Ms. English herself.  Otherwise, Zwigoff uses an even hand in his portrayals.Other than the legacy Crumb will leave with his innovative work, the film focuses heavily on his family life (or lives).What the heck was in the water at the Crumb house?  Besides Robert and his well-known proclivities, his lesser known siblings have serious problems of their own.  Older brother Charles, still living at home with his overbearing mother at the time the film was shot, admits to a severe reliance on tranquilizers, and baths biannually.  Younger brother Maxon (whose role in the Crumb boys' childhood comics company was &quot;supply boy&quot;), lives alone in a dive hotel and spends his days cleansing his colon with a long strip of cloth while sitting on a bed of nails (two sisters declined to be interviewed).  Upon seeing the devastating dysfunction of the apples that fell from the Crumb family tree, one begins to wonder not how odd Robert turned out, but rather how normal.  It's the film's most startling revelation.Some of the most touching moments are those of Crumb with his own kids.  Young daughter Sophie, the only woman Crumb's ever loved, receives her fathers gentle affection willingly.  Son Jesse sports the costume of the hippies that Crumb so despised (long hair and dirty beard), but his artistic talent more than makes up for this transgression in his father's eyes.  One moment has the two men competing in a contest to best reproduce a photo of an ugly insane woman.  Contrast the unsettling subject matter of the photo, with Robert's sincere artistic advice to his son on how to draw out its interesting elements, and you get a wonderful scene of iconoclastic domesticity.&quot;Crumb&quot;, the film, like Crumb, the artist, manages to combine humour and tragic sadness in a cohesive whole.  It is at once repellent and mesmerizing, encompassing nearly every aspect of humanity.  From the perverse to the pleasant, it all seems somewhat, well, Natural.

16058,AGTFW4TAC7W2H,0767821505,"M. McClellan ""marksakissfan""","[9, 11]","""Crumb"" is a movie where you must learn to read beneath the lines as to who this artist is. Nothing about this man is as what it seems initially. But if you study this movie (as it is a film to be studied) you will realize the malice R.Crumb puts into his artwork is directed solely at the attitudes of society. And that includes every aspect and every class of people. It doesn't seem to matter who they are. He is an artist that details everything he sees with frightening clarity and no regard for diplomacy. It's an ability not confined to gender or color. His comics read like an illustrated passage of a diary. As you dig more into his backround (the film is NOT the last word on him) you realize that no one is exempt from his wrath. Not men, not women, not ethnics. After reading several reviews and chats about what they observed in this film, it's obvious that many viewers took what they saw at face value.Looking at his artwork you realize R.Crumb combined the look of innocent comic strips of the early 20th century with more explicit content common today. No one else at the time had thought of drawing this way. The comic book industry in the 60's was becoming increasingly progressive. The old look of comics, Lil Abner or Little Orphan Annie for example, were considered passe.The inspiration for R.Crumb's art comes from a deeply dysfunctional family. It wasn't an overly violent family but it was a morbidly depressing one. You learn that the problems Robert and his siblings had stemmed from the fact that their house was dominated by a father who saw manhood in only one way  and was not lenient in his views to accomodate any of his sons' artistic potential. As Robert pointed out, when his father came home from work any blip of a happy man dissapeared as soon as he entered the door. When it came to encouragement or artistic development all five children had only each other and were left to their own devices. Robert became the success perhaps because he, unlike Charles for instance, saw his talent as a way to define himself and not simply as a means of profit. He chose the format (comics) he knew best to make his point.The bulk of his material consists of two main topics:his family and women. His attitudes on women are far more complicated. His unpopularity with girls as a teen is due to a result of his inability to fashion himself into something they wanted visually. And he was equally frustrated at THEIR apparent inability to ignore those instincts and see him for the good person he felt he was. It has led to lifelong love/hate relationship with the opposite sex. One that is defined by pure lust and no real affection for females for who they are except in the case of his daughter Sophie.His views on blacks and the never ending debate as to whether or not he is racist is not given nearly as much screentime.He denounces the critism he has garnered by saying ""it all came from white liberals."" That's not exactly an ideal way of defending yourself in a largely white liberal society. Neither he, nor Terry Zwigoff (who made this movie), give a straight answer to the charge and leave other artists to answer for Crumb. But if you take into account Crumb's true love of black music (specifically, delta blues of 30's) it becomes harder to pin the ""racist"" label on him.

With its mix of psychedelics and graphic sex, it was an instant hit with all of my friends and as we entered adolescence, we got the whole lot of underground comics.  The writing and images were of such high quality that we spent many many hours pouring over them as if they were literature.This documentary convinced me that indeed they represent great art.  The most important character in this is of course Crumb himself, with his immediate and wider family as well as his cultural milieu.  It was absolutely fascinating to see the strains of mental illness in his family, from his amphetamine-addicted mother and volatile brutish father to his unfortunate brothers.  It is not just the stereotype of ""outsider as artistic observer"", but a much deeper and shockingly open glimpse into Crumb's makeup as a bitter outcast in a yuppified society, with the strangest sexual obsessions.  He likes big women and has bizarre tastes, which go straight into his art; he despises mainstream consumerism and even the American dream of making it big.  He also lived out his fantasies and many of his ex's are in the film.  Fortunately, while often sad, the family is full of humor, ironic self-awareness, and fun.  It is a very rounded portrait.On another level, there is a lot about his method of working and creating.  This was perhaps the most interesting to me, as you witness, in the most unpretentious fashion, a great artist pursuing his craft and own direction.  I loved to hear how he just free associates and doesn't care what it means, how he constantly draws, how he instructs his son to ""cheat"" for the right effect, how he critiques images in minute detail, where he gets his source material.  The background on his training - he wrote comics as a kid under the direction of his older brother and didn't go to art school - is also fascinating.Finally, with art critic Robert Hughes and some feminist journalists, you get a serious discussion of the art's worth.  I agree that Crumb is like a modern-day Breugel or (perhaps better) Daumier:  he exemplifies a certain kind of angst and rebellion, displaying his obsessions with undeniably great talent.  Then there are those who think he is subversive and indulges in pornography, perhaps even a danger to society.  It is serious food for thought.REcommended with the greatest enthusiasm.

There seems to be no order of events here, the camera really does just follow him around.As kids, Robert, his brothers and sisters, had a somewhat normal childhood. We see photos - the smiling happy kids, who all look ""normal."" (what went wrong?) The brothers discuss how they used to draw things from school and life, as kids. The had a club, and eventually a comic book. Each had their contributions.Robert went on to fame and fortune. The two sisters refused to be part of this documentary (humm..)

They sit in Charles' filthy bedroom, he admits to not showering for a month. (ick) They show tons of early work and photographs, which was fascinating.Not for young kids. Ooodles of nudity, swearing, vulgar talk, and vulgar art. We watched this for my dear Norman, a huge fan of Mr. Natural. All this time, I thought Mr. Natural was a friend of the Grateful Dead, and now I learned - nope.One thing I admired about Robert, other than his genius talent, is that he refused to sell out. He got offers to do album covers or shows or books, that he could have got tons of money for, but, if he wasn't interested, he just wasn't interested.

It's a film to see, but not to own, at least not for cinematic reasons.R. Crumb himself comes off as a Howard Stern with talent minus any conspicuous desire for fame or even tendencies toward exhibitionism.  The documentary, like its main character, is usually described as a candid picture of a dirty-minded artist who freely explores and exposes our own illicit, if repressed, fantasies and desires.  But the film is more than a look at a pop artist who serves up controversial crudeness. Rather it allows us to feel an undertone of discomfort about his family which gradually builds to a realization of horror, as we finally see the degree to which Crumb's once normal-enough siblings and parents veered into corridors of total dysfunctionality.For some viewers, there will undoubtedly be comfort in knowing their own families are nothing like R. Crumb's.  Many of us, on the other hand, will no doubt recognize in ""Crumb"" the failure of parents and children, of genes and dreams. The film speaks to the tragedy of lost potential--and in the end any fame or commercial success R. Crumb achieves seems to have been purchased at a high price.",4,Substance over style.,1011571200,"01 21, 2002",2002,1603,"['Perhaps', 'initial', 'rejection', 'documentary', 'Academy', 'numerous', 'critics', 'jumped', 'Crumb', 'bandwagon', 'proclaiming', 'film', 'best', 'nineties', 'most', 'significant', 'cinematic', 'event', 'recent', 'years', 'definitive', 'portrait', 'countercultural', 'pop', 'artist', 'etc', 'Get', 'off', 'it.Crumb', 'good', 'documentary', 'be', 'relatively', 'invisible', 'making', 'fascinating', 'subject', 'exclusive', 'focus', 'two', 'engaging', 'hours', 'film', 'see', 'not', 'own', 'least', 'not', 'cinematic', 'reasons.R', 'Crumb', 'off', 'Howard', 'Stern', 'talent', 'minus', 'conspicuous', 'desire', 'fame', 'even', 'tendencies', 'exhibitionism', 'documentary', 'main', 'character', 'usually', 'described', 'candid', 'picture', 'dirty-minded', 'artist', 'who', 'freely', 'own', 'illicit', 'repressed', 'fantasies', 'desires', 'film', 'more', 'look', 'pop', 'artist', 'who', 'up', 'controversial', 'crudeness', 'feel', 'undertone', 'discomfort', 'family', 'gradually', 'realization', 'horror', 'finally', 'see', 'degree', 'Crumb', 'once', 'normal-enough', 'siblings', 'parents', 'veered', 'corridors', 'total', 'dysfunctionality.For', 'viewers', 'will', 'undoubtedly', 'be', 'comfort', 'knowing', 'own', 'families', 'are', 'nothing', 'R.', 'Crumb', 'Many', 'other', 'hand', 'will', 'doubt', 'recognize', 'Crumb', 'failure', 'parents', 'children', 'genes', 'dreams', 'film', 'tragedy', 'lost', 'potential', 'end', 'fame', 'commercial', 'success', 'R.', 'Crumb', 'have', 'been', 'purchased', 'high', 'price']",N/A
16071,A1TK6WNUIAEQRU,0767821505,stoic,"[0, 1]","Crumb is a fascinating documentary on the life and work of Zap Comix artist Robert Crumb.Zap Comix became something of an icon in the 1960s. As the primary artist behind Zap, Crumb gained a measure of fame. Crumb's comics were subversive comments on the failures and limitations of American society. Zap also reflected Crumb's sexual obsessions and many of the comics are sexist. In the film Crumb offers no real defense of his more-questionable work.The best aspect of Crumb is its focus on Robert Crumb's family life. Crumb grew up in a grossly-dysfunctional family in Philadelphia; his father was in the Marine Corps and his mother was an amphetamine addict. Crumb's older brother Charles influenced Robert's art, but suffers from mental illness and was never able to move away from home. Crumb's younger brother Maxon lives in a dingy San Francisco hotel room where he also creates art. The coverage of Crumb's family life is moving and it provides some idea of the forces that shaped Robert's art. (Unfortunately, Crumb's two sisters chose not to appear in the film; his father was deceased; his mother, meanwhile, offers no real insights).Some viewers may find it difficult to separate Crumb the movie from Robert Crumb, the person. While Crumb is remarkable, he is also limited in many respects. Crumb cannot interact with people in a mature manner; instead, he attempts to compensate with a grating laugh when confronted with anything that is uncomfortable.Crumb also makes a lot of comments on the banality of contemporary U.S. culture. While I tend to agree with his remarks, Crumb has little original to say. His comments, therefore, do little for the film.At the end of the film it is difficult to say whether Crumb's life or his art is more disturbing; the film makes the point, however, that one cannot separate the two. This is a great film that offers its viewers no easy answers.",5,One of a Kind,1262304000,"01 1, 2010",2010,1896,"['Crumb', 'fascinating', 'documentary', 'life', 'work', 'Zap', 'Comix', 'artist', 'Robert', 'Crumb.Zap', 'Comix', 'became', 'something', 'icon', '1960s', 'primary', 'artist', 'Zap', 'Crumb', 'gained', 'measure', 'fame', 'Crumb', 'comics', 'were', 'subversive', 'comments', 'failures', 'limitations', 'American', 'society', 'Zap', 'also', 'reflected', 'Crumb', 'sexual', 'obsessions', 'many', 'comics', 'are', 'sexist', 'film', 'Crumb', 'real', 'defense', 'more-questionable', 'work.The', 'best', 'aspect', 'Crumb', 'focus', 'Robert', 'Crumb', 'family', 'life', 'Crumb', 'grew', 'up', 'grossly-dysfunctional', 'family', 'Philadelphia', 'father', 'was', 'Marine', 'Corps', 'mother', 'was', 'amphetamine', 'addict', 'Crumb', 'older', 'brother', 'Charles', 'influenced', 'Robert', 'art', 'suffers', 'mental', 'illness', 'was', 'never', 'able', 'move', 'away', 'home', 'Crumb', 'younger', 'brother', 'Maxon', 'dingy', 'San', 'Francisco', 'hotel', 'room', 'where', 'also', 'art', 'coverage', 'Crumb', 'family', 'life', 'moving', 'idea', 'forces', 'shaped', 'Robert', 'art', 'Unfortunately', 'Crumb', 'two', 'sisters', 'chose', 'not', 'appear', 'film', 'father', 'was', 'deceased', 'mother', 'meanwhile', 'real', 'insights', '.Some', 'viewers', 'may', 'find', 'difficult', 'separate', 'Crumb', 'movie', 'Robert', 'Crumb', 'person', 'Crumb', 'remarkable', 'also', 'limited', 'many', 'respects', 'Crumb', 'can', 'not', 'interact', 'people', 'mature', 'manner', 'instead', 'compensate', 'grating', 'laugh', 'when', 'confronted', 'anything', 'uncomfortable.Crumb', 'also', 'lot', 'comments', 'banality', 'contemporary', 'U.S.', 'culture', 'tend', 'agree', 'remarks', 'Crumb', 'little', 'original', 'say', 'comments', 'therefore', 'do', 'little', 'film.At', 'end', 'film', 'difficult', 'say', 'Crumb', 'life', 'art', 'more', 'disturbing', 'film', 'point', 'however', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'separate', 'two', 'great', 'film', 'viewers', 'easy', 'answers']",N/A

His mother and brothers are shown as very eccentric and he is the most normal of the three. The film also has interviews with colleagues and others who enjoy his work. The artist is controversial due to many of his comics being pornographic and some of which contain material which depicts racial stereotypes.I found the film interesting because I live less than two miles from the house where his mother and brother used to live. Only the interior of the house is shown in the film but I was able to figure out which one it was.The DVD contains two audio commentaries.

It tells the story of Robert Crumb, a famous underground cartoonist who began his career in the San Francisco area in the 60s.  We learn about his youth, the history of his work, and get to meet his family, including his wife, ex-wife, and children  (with the exception of his sisters, but who could blame them for not partaking in this).And what a family it is.  Wow.  As odd as he is (and that's ODD!), his family takes the cake.  One brother is probably near genius intelligence, reads voraciously, doesn't shower, doesn't leave the house, is suicidal and psychopathic, tells about his homicidal thoughts, is on medication, and lives in a house with their mother and at least one cat.  I could almost smell the funk that must have been that house.  I wonder how the crew did it.  The other lives alone in an apartment in San Francisco, has obvious high intelligence also, paints, practices yoga, sits and meditates on a bed of nails (in public), has a history of uncontrollable lewd behavior (he describes for a about once de-skirting a woman in public), and doesn't seem to have any other friends either.  Watching Crumb visit with these people is one of the oddest things I have ever seen.  He understands them and is willing to talk to them about anything in front of the camera.  During their conversations he often looks at us almost disbelievingly and with a smirk, as if to say, I may be nuts, but not THIS nuts!  Like he's in on the joke with us.  But strangley enough, so are his brothers; they KNOW they're screwed up.There are abundant shots of his cartoons here, and they are definitely for a select audience.  He's not a children's cartoonist.  Mysogynistic is too subtle to describe his work.  We get to see him working and he takes us through and explains some of his previous work.  It's fascinating.By the end, we have had an incredible view into the life of Robert Crumb and, love him or hate him, one has to be in awe.  Compared to his family, this is a men who has done very well for himself and has used his talent as a cartoonist to assuage the demons that may have overcome him like they did his brothers.This is a high recommendation.
