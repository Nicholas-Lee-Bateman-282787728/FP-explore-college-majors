It takes very little for me to become a rabid fan of film.  I really wanted this to fall w/in that category, but it doesn't. On one hand, the production values are surprisingly good - good camera work, obviously high quality camera, good lighting, good(ish) sets, decent cast, etc.  So all of that made the movie certainly watchable, but it was the plot that left much to be desired.  The movie mostly meandered through without any real or cohesive direction.  There was this killer bit, but then there was also this ghostly influence bit.  The two were not harmonized in any meaningful manner, and made it feel empty, as if someone was just shooting random scenes and later splicing them together to fill a disc.  So again, it was watchable because of the production quality and cast, but the lack of a good story line keeps this from achieving 3 or more stars.  And the kid from terminator got fat.",2,"Good production, ultra weak story",1241827200,"05 9, 2009",2009,1026,"['Horror', 'especially', 'B', 'horror', 'ultimate', 'favorite', 'being', 'case', 'standards', 'get', 'very', 'relaxed', 'genre', 'very', 'little', 'become', 'rabid', 'fan', 'film', 'really', 'wanted', 'fall', 'w/in', 'category', ""n't"", 'one', 'hand', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'good', 'camera', 'work', 'obviously', 'high', 'quality', 'camera', 'good', 'lighting', 'good', 'ish', 'sets', 'decent', 'cast', 'etc', 'made', 'movie', 'certainly', 'watchable', 'was', 'plot', 'left', 'much', 'be', 'desired', 'movie', 'mostly', 'meandered', 'real', 'cohesive', 'direction', 'was', 'killer', 'bit', 'then', 'was', 'also', 'ghostly', 'influence', 'bit', 'two', 'were', 'not', 'harmonized', 'meaningful', 'manner', 'made', 'feel', 'empty', 'someone', 'was', 'just', 'shooting', 'random', 'scenes', 'later', 'splicing', 'together', 'fill', 'disc', 'So', 'again', 'was', 'watchable', 'production', 'quality', 'cast', 'lack', 'good', 'story', 'line', 'achieving', '3', 'more', 'stars', 'kid', 'terminator', 'got', 'fat']",Dark Reel

After all Edward Furlong, the teeny star of Terminator 2, was in it, and I have never seen a movie that he was in that wasn't good.  Well, sorry to say, but this time my luck with good ole Eddie would finally run out.  And its not his fault that this wanna be Horror flickt is so aweful...THe biggest problem is that there is basically no real plot here, just a jumbled together kind of story that any 6 year old could come up with in no time.  Honestly, its that bad- something about a woman that gets killed by a vicious guy and then comes back to haunt people as a ghost, whenever a certain part in a movie is played, but its only 1-2 people that can actually see her in that movie part!  No exaggeration, its just that bad, and that's the plot, except that a killer is apparently taking revenge for her, oh man, spare me.The acting. all execpt for Furlong, is terrible; it feels as if the actors are all amateurs (although they're not).The bottom line is: THis isn't even a B movie, as others have written its more like an F movie and that stands for failure!

1221676,A2SRP2HP75CUVD,B001O3M37K,Horror-Fanatics.com,"[6, 7]","I always urge people not to judge movies by their covers (and in some cases, trailers). Even with this notion, you still can't help but take interest because it's the cover that gives the first impression. Typically direct-to-video flicks will have a good cover. That doesn't necessarily mean that the movie is going to be as good. There's a reason why most of these things never make it into the theatres any. Some studios put cleavage or graphic violence on the cover to lure you in. I guess where I'm going with this statement is that the cover for Dark Reel looks just as typical as any other straight to DVD horror cover. It's horrible, and doesn't really do it justice. If you were to judge it, you would think that it's nothing more then a low budget mess. That's actually what I thought Dark Reel would be like. Surprisingly, Dark Reel is not all that bad. Yes it is low budget, but it sure doesn't look that way.In the movie we follow Adam Waltz's unsure journey as he wins a contest for a walk on part in an upcoming pirate b-movie called ""Pirate Wench."" There he meets his favorite actress Cassie Blue (Tiffany Shepis). Later in production, Adam meets the rest of the cast and crew and begins to rehearse his ""one"" line. In the meantime, there's a serial killer running loose on set, killing off some of the cast members. The lead investigator on the case is Shields (Tony Todd), and along with his partner they question the crew as to who might be the one responsible. When one of the pirate wenches turns up dead on set, the studio calls for re-writes and decides to give Adam a much bigger part, complete with more dialog. The story later ties in with the real unpublicized murder of actress Scarlett May, who was killed in 1958.The ""Scarlett May"" side of things is a nice touch and really sets the tone during the opening credits. The problem is that I couldn't piece it together with the plot involving Edward Furlong's character. For awhile it just made no sense to me. The movie really didn't need the backstory or supernatural elements. It just feels like a recycled homage to Wes Craven's ""Scream."" There is a killer loose on set going after the actresses, but the death scenes are so few and far in between. After the first hour I forgot that I was even watching a horror movie. The opening credits display severed body parts and an ounce of blood, but it just takes way too long for the killer to appear later on screen with the mask that's displayed on the DVD cover. The pacing is way off and if you're expecting to see a ""blood and guts"" kind of movie, you will be very disappointed. There's hardly any horror in this horror story. Perhaps that's the most horrific thing about it.The movie needed some trimming here and there, because it drags on a little too much for a slasher flick. It does focus a great deal on the characters and that's always a good thing. The problem with that is it's too much. Maybe I should have expected a character study. The main focus of the plot is the relationship between Furlong and Shepis' characters. They build a friendship which eventually leads to romance, and then love. Now, I love both Furlong and Shepis, but their on screen relationship is hard to believe. Well, maybe just in parts because I actually thought the love plot worked. Seeing Adam and Cassie together was kind of cute. Love comes in all shapes and sizes, and some decent acting can make it better. Tiffany Shepis continues to impress me with her work and her talent just gets better with every film. I say the same thing about Furlong, though I still want him to go for the much larger roles. He's too good for this kind of job.",3,Lance Henriksen and Tony Todd are wonderful together!,1236816000,"03 12, 2009",2009,3661,"['always', 'urge', 'people', 'not', 'judge', 'movies', 'covers', 'cases', 'trailers', 'Even', 'notion', 'still', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'take', 'interest', 'cover', 'first', 'impression', 'Typically', 'direct-to-video', 'flicks', 'will', 'have', 'good', 'cover', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'mean', 'movie', 'going', 'be', 'as', 'good', 'reason', 'why', 'most', 'things', 'never', 'make', 'theatres', 'studios', 'put', 'cleavage', 'graphic', 'violence', 'cover', 'lure', 'guess', 'where', ""'m"", 'going', 'statement', 'cover', 'Dark', 'Reel', 'just', 'as', 'typical', 'other', 'straight', 'DVD', 'horror', 'cover', 'horrible', ""n't"", 'really', 'do', 'justice', 'were', 'judge', 'would', 'think', 'nothing', 'more', 'then', 'low', 'budget', 'mess', 'actually', 'what', 'thought', 'Dark', 'Reel', 'would', 'be', 'Surprisingly', 'Dark', 'Reel', 'not', 'bad', 'Yes', 'low', 'budget', 'sure', ""n't"", 'look', 'movie', 'follow', 'Adam', 'Waltz', 'unsure', 'journey', 'contest', 'walk', 'part', 'upcoming', 'pirate', 'b-movie', 'called', 'Pirate', 'Wench', 'favorite', 'actress', 'Cassie', 'Blue', 'Tiffany', 'Shepis', 'Later', 'production', 'Adam', 'rest', 'cast', 'crew', 'rehearse', 'one', 'line', 'meantime', 'serial', 'killer', 'running', 'loose', 'set', 'killing', 'off', 'cast', 'members', 'lead', 'investigator', 'case', 'Shields', 'Tony', 'Todd', 'partner', 'question', 'crew', 'who', 'might', 'be', 'one', 'responsible', 'When', 'one', 'pirate', 'wenches', 'up', 'dead', 'set', 'studio', 're-writes', 'decides', 'give', 'Adam', 'much', 'bigger', 'part', 'complete', 'more', 'dialog', 'story', 'later', 'ties', 'real', 'unpublicized', 'murder', 'actress', 'Scarlett', 'May', 'who', 'was', 'killed', '1958.The', 'Scarlett', 'May', 'side', 'things', 'nice', 'touch', 'really', 'tone', 'opening', 'credits', 'problem', 'could', ""n't"", 'piece', 'together', 'plot', 'involving', 'Edward', 'Furlong', 'character', 'just', 'made', 'sense', 'movie', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'backstory', 'supernatural', 'elements', 'just', 'feels', 'recycled', 'homage', 'Wes', 'Craven', 'Scream', 'killer', 'loose', 'set', 'going', 'actresses', 'death', 'scenes', 'are', 'so', 'few', 'far', 'first', 'hour', 'forgot', 'was', 'even', 'watching', 'horror', 'movie', 'opening', 'credits', 'display', 'severed', 'body', 'parts', 'ounce', 'blood', 'just', 'way', 'too', 'long', 'killer', 'appear', 'later', 'screen', 'mask', 'displayed', 'DVD', 'cover', 'pacing', 'way', ""'re"", 'expecting', 'see', 'blood', 'guts', 'kind', 'movie', 'will', 'be', 'very', 'disappointed', 'hardly', 'horror', 'horror', 'story', 'Perhaps', 'most', 'horrific', 'thing', 'it.The', 'movie', 'needed', 'trimming', 'here', 'there', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'slasher', 'flick', 'focus', 'great', 'deal', 'characters', 'always', 'good', 'thing', 'problem', 'too', 'much', 'Maybe', 'should', 'have', 'expected', 'character', 'study', 'main', 'focus', 'plot', 'relationship', 'Furlong', 'Shepis', 'characters', 'build', 'friendship', 'eventually', 'romance', 'then', 'love', 'Now', 'love', 'Furlong', 'Shepis', 'screen', 'relationship', 'hard', 'believe', 'Well', 'maybe', 'just', 'parts', 'actually', 'thought', 'love', 'plot', 'worked', 'Seeing', 'Adam', 'Cassie', 'together', 'was', 'kind', 'cute', 'Love', 'shapes', 'sizes', 'decent', 'acting', 'can', 'make', 'better', 'Tiffany', 'Shepis', 'impress', 'work', 'talent', 'just', 'better', 'film', 'say', 'same', 'thing', 'Furlong', 'still', 'want', 'go', 'much', 'larger', 'roles', 'too', 'good', 'kind', 'job']",Dark Reel

1221678,ANAYSRE3LX8GZ,B001O3M37K,Micheal Hunt,"[1, 3]","The movie starts off with a killing back in the 50's, where an inspiring actress is lured for an audition and finds herself part of what probably would have made more sense had it been a snuff film... then it kicks to 30 years later or so and John Connor fills in a entry form to win a walk in roll on a film with his favorite actress in a stupid pirate movie.After his win, he meets the cast and and some fictional leading lady celebrity takes a shining to him, but at the end of the night one of the cast members is killed by who they think is Scarlet Something, the chick who got killed in the 50's.Whats-his-face from T2 ends up being presented a larger role then his walk on one now that the other princess has been killed. And is also under suspicion of murder by some dumb blonde cop and her partner the Candyman.Another murder takes place, but things start to get strange when the cast is watching the dailies, that Pet Cemetery star see's the ghost of Scarlet on the screen, but no one else can. He also receives strange phone calls that he comes to terms with being Scarlet trying to communicate from the dead of who killed her.Overall, the plot does not sound too bad at all. it's the pay off that lets this movie down. The end of the movie seemed to have a panic attack and just call it a day. It went everywhere and if it had have had a decent ending, it might have been worthy of watching again.

Durham ""Big Evil""","[3, 4]","Dark Reel starts out promisingly enough, with the ghastly murder of Scarlett May (Alexandra Holden) being committed years earlier, leading us to meeting an uber-fan named Adam (Edward Furlong) who has won a contest to be an extra in the latest film starring his favorite B-movie actress Cassie Blue (Tiffany Shepis).  Not long after that, more murders start occuring, and Adam starts seeing apparitions of Scarlett.  There is much potential in Dark Reel that sadly gets wasted due to the fact that the film is poorly paced, and overall pretty boring as well.  The gore effects, when they do occur, are pretty well done, but the various in-jokes and a sleepwalking performance from Furlong don't help matters any.  Genre stalwarts Lance Henriksen and Tony Todd are here as well, and chew up as much scenery as they can manage to do.
