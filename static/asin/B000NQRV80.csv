This is about two brother's that have a dad that's an alchemist, and then there mother always smiled at edward because he reminded her of there dad, then edward and elric's mother died so edward and elric went and got one of there dad's book to try to bring there mother back but an accident happend, edward lost one of his arm and leg and elric's soul got transported into a armor, edward saw something that was disgusting and that was'nt there mom. Edward was wondering were his brother went then when elric spoke edward was shocked and upset, elric took edward to that old lady's house to get help then edward recovered and then recived a metal arm and a metal leg. Edward's arm has alchemy that can make thing's appear like his sword, a wall, and make the ground colapse when targeting enemys and fix thing's, the use of edward's alchemy don't need a circle to summon his weapons' or to fixable use. His brother recived alchemy as well but he has to draw a circle in order to use his alchemy, edward he just put his hand's together and face them on the floor or the wall, and what ever he summon's will appear, that's cool.

1060211,A3LIWTQDSQ5UOO,B000NQRV80,"Jonathan Oyama ""Welcome to die!""","[3, 4]","I've had mixed feelings about this series until I reached episode 22. Then I was certain that this was a keeper. Fullmetal Alchemist is a heart-wrenching, exciting action anime that struggles with the heart-wrenching issues of genocide and destruction.The two main characters, Edward and Alphonse Elric, are seeking the Philosopher's Stone to bring back their missing body parts. They tried to ressurect their mother with the magic of alchemy, but instead, Alphonse lost his body and Edward lost an arm and a leg. And while their mother did come back from the dead, she definitely wasn't human.Although this box covers the only the first 16 episodes, this is a decent starter set to pique people's interest in the series. The first episodes cover Ed and Al's journey to become state alchemists to gain access to alchemy books. Ed and Al also discover the liquid material responsible for making a philosopher's stone.These aren't the most important episodes--those episodes were saved for the second part of season one. However, I can tell you that this is the best anime ever made--questioning whether the ends justify the means--whether people should sacrifice millions of lives for the things they desire.Finally, I love this more than Evangelion, which is far more controversial for its ending, which drops the characters into really long existential speeches. I don't like to write about Evangelion--either people love it or they hate it. Fortunately, anyone can fall in love with this series, as long as they can bear with some bloody violence.",5,Fullmetal excellent,1192320000,"10 14, 2007",2007,1549,"[""'ve"", 'had', 'mixed', 'feelings', 'series', 'reached', 'episode', '22', 'Then', 'was', 'certain', 'was', 'keeper', 'Fullmetal', 'Alchemist', 'heart-wrenching', 'exciting', 'action', 'anime', 'heart-wrenching', 'issues', 'genocide', 'destruction.The', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'Edward', 'Alphonse', 'Elric', 'are', 'seeking', 'Philosopher', 'Stone', 'bring', 'back', 'missing', 'body', 'parts', 'tried', 'ressurect', 'mother', 'magic', 'alchemy', 'instead', 'Alphonse', 'lost', 'body', 'Edward', 'lost', 'arm', 'leg', 'mother', 'did', 'come', 'back', 'dead', 'definitely', 'was', ""n't"", 'human.Although', 'box', 'only', 'first', '16', 'episodes', 'decent', 'starter', 'set', 'pique', 'people', 'interest', 'series', 'first', 'cover', 'Ed', 'Al', 'journey', 'become', 'state', 'alchemists', 'gain', 'access', 'alchemy', 'books', 'Ed', 'Al', 'also', 'liquid', 'material', 'responsible', 'making', 'philosopher', 'stone.These', 'are', ""n't"", 'most', 'important', 'episodes', 'episodes', 'were', 'saved', 'second', 'part', 'season', 'one', 'However', 'can', 'tell', 'best', 'anime', 'ever', 'made', 'questioning', 'ends', 'justify', 'means', 'people', 'should', 'sacrifice', 'millions', 'lives', 'things', 'desire.Finally', 'love', 'more', 'Evangelion', 'far', 'more', 'controversial', 'ending', 'characters', 'really', 'long', 'existential', 'speeches', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'write', 'Evangelion', 'people', 'love', 'hate', 'Fortunately', 'anyone', 'can', 'fall', 'love', 'series', 'as', 'long', 'can', 'bear', 'bloody', 'violence']","Fullmetal Alchemist: Season 1, Part 1"
1060212,AMYSV3PZLNDCS,B000NQRV80,Just some old guy.,"[0, 0]","This is a story of Alchemy and the consequences of using such power. Two brothers..Edward and Alphonse break the rules of Alchemy and try to bring back their dead mother. What they bring back is not their mother and it cost them more than they ever thought. Thus begins the story of the Fullmetal Alchemist and his brother who are trying to right a wrong and just get their lives back to normal.The story is 51 episodes and the movie ""The Conquerer of Shambala"". This series has so many characters and it does lag at times but it is necessary in order for character development. That is the only way you can understand the motives behind so many of those characters actions.This is something I have watched a few times..it has great replay value. It is one of my top 3 along with Trinity Blood & Death Note. I highly recommend this.The only draw back for me is that sometimes when they get hit in the head they have swirling lines where their eyes should be.

""Fantasy and Romance Author""","[3, 4]","One of the best anime series to come along in recent years, Fullmetal Alchemist is an action-adventure series set in an alternate Earth, where alchemy rather than physics is the rule of the universe. Two young boys, both geniuses, try to bring their mother back from the dead, with horrific consequences that echo down the run of the series, and finally come full-circle in the final story arc. Engrossing, well-characterized storytelling.Though I normally prefer the original Japanese voice actors to English dubs, the voice casting and directing on the English soundtrack is excellent.Now for my nitpick, which has to do with how Funimation chose to package their DVDs. One of my pet peeves are previews/advertisements on DVDs that you cannot fast-forward through or skip. Funimation has put a long advertisement for Dragonball Z at the beginning of each and every disc in this boxed set, and you cannot fast-forward or skip it. Argh!

As their journey progresses they come across different life altering situations capable of molding their young minds into a darker distortion of their innocence.  From making friends with a young girl to seeing that young girl alchemically molded into a monstrosaty by her own father, the Elric brothers realize that they are living in a world as ugly and wretched as any nightmare that could have plagued their troubled minds.

Although I have a childhood affinity with Dragonball and its 300+ episode glory, stuff like that, orNaruto, just isn't what you want to see too much of in anime.Not to mention they usually have terrible english dubs. Full Metal Alchemist (FMA) on the other hand, deserves its fanbase. The box itself is nicely designed including the inside booklets from each of the volumes before it's Boxed Release (I think but not first handedly sure). Sliding it out, I knew it was the right choice I bought this after having watched it before on another source. I think only the best can be watched, already and Then bought for principles sake. The foil on the inside sleeve of the box reflects that glistening in my eyes as I begin to watch this great series once again!Well, it has memorable characters, mostly because of a lot of development in them from the first few episodes on. You can sympathise with Ed and Al, the two young brother protagonists of the series. Hopefully you rent put off by Ed's not so cool look, as he is, as referenced frequently as a joke in the anime ""pint sized"", his character and dark past make up for his non macho or pretty boy look. The sense of morality, brotherhood, questions on the world parallel to one similar to our own involving War and Religion are some of the passing topics of this series.But this first box, creates the topics I listed, set up for the brothers and their allies to confront in the later boxes.But most importantly, I need to tell you this. The English Dub, us Great!It somehow makes Ed alot more mature and cooler than the japanese dub. And subtitles, you get the choice of the English Dubtitle, or English subtitle translation of the japanese voice acting. Which is nice to know the original meaning and dialogue as well as to get some of the japanese thinking or nominclature.But the only problems I had is with the unskippable Advert at the start of each of the discs. Although, to be honest I saw some interest in the movies that I meant to have picked up on DVD. But Funimation should have made them skippable, like the Disney Ads CAN be skipped or we can use it to fill up the popcorn bowl or pour some drinks...Cmon friends, fellow humans, Give FMA a watch.

What would you be prepared to pay to bring it back from the dead?Using an art that balances on the Principle of Equivalent Exchange, two brothers attempt to bring back their mother, and lose themselves. This is the story of their journey to find themselves again.Suitable for both children and adults, this story explores the relationships of the characters, as they struggle to gain back that which they have lost. Full of adventure, fast-paced action and deep emotion, it will keep you fascinated until the very end.I recommend watching the subtitled version.
