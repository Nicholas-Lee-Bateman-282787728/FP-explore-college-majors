If the Warner Archive series had SUBTITLES I would buy a lot of them. but without that, I only bought a few DVD's which I already regret because they are difficult to follow without subtitles. I will definitely buy no more now. For the price Warner is asking for those DVD's they could well have subtitled them and made a lot of people happy.Ad de Koning, Almere, Holland",1,No Subtitles,1316217600,"09 17, 2011",2011,440,"['completely', 'agree', 'review', 'Toni', 'Riess', 'Switzerland', 'Warner', 'Archive', 'series', 'had', 'SUBTITLES', 'would', 'buy', 'lot', 'only', 'bought', 'few', 'DVD', 'already', 'regret', 'are', 'difficult', 'follow', 'subtitles', 'will', 'definitely', 'buy', 'more', 'now', 'price', 'Warner', 'asking', 'DVD', 'could', 'well', 'have', 'subtitled', 'made', 'lot', 'people', 'happy.Ad', 'Koning', 'Almere', 'Holland']",N/A

Maybe not the best musical like ""Seven Brides for seven Brothers"" or ""Hit the Deck"" and ""Kismet"" (where Howard Keel and Ann Blyth stars again together).Nice this time: its remastered and contains a unusued musical scene with Bert Lahr and Marjorie Maine as bonus.the Picture-Format is 2.55:1 and looks great. The picture Quality is almost perfect and also the sound is in stereo. Of course, it could be better.My biggest problem I have with Warner Archive: NOT RESTORED and NO SUBTITLES (for foreign speaking people or DEAF /hard-of-hearing people).So I give only 3 Stars.P.S. I hope they will do a better job for a Blu-Ray release.",3,"Movie gets 4 1/2 stars, DVD-Product only 3",1304726400,"05 7, 2011",2011,847,"['Well', 'nice', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'bring', 'out', 'classic', 'MGM', 'movies', 'DVD', 'Warner', 'Archive', 'Collection.The', 'movie', 'filmed', 'bright', 'Cinemascope', 'lot', 'location', 'glorious', 'Technicolor', 'great', 'Maybe', 'not', 'best', 'musical', 'Seven', 'Brides', 'seven', 'Brothers', 'Hit', 'Deck', 'Kismet', 'where', 'Howard', 'Keel', 'Ann', 'Blyth', 'stars', 'again', 'together', '.Nice', 'time', 'remastered', 'unusued', 'musical', 'scene', 'Bert', 'Lahr', 'Marjorie', 'Maine', 'bonus.the', 'Picture-Format', '2.55:1', 'great', 'picture', 'Quality', 'almost', 'perfect', 'also', 'sound', 'stereo', 'course', 'could', 'be', 'better.My', 'biggest', 'problem', 'have', 'Warner', 'Archive', 'NOT', 'RESTORED', 'NO', 'SUBTITLES', 'foreign', 'speaking', 'people', 'DEAF', '/hard-of-hearing', 'people', '.So', 'give', 'only', '3', 'Stars.P.S', 'hope', 'will', 'do', 'better', 'job', 'Blu-Ray', 'release']",N/A
1431497,A3N8RZSXKN1OR2,B004X63SFG,Chrijeff,"[1, 1]","In the beautiful Canadian Rockies in the late Victorian era, rugged Sgt. Mike Malone (Howard Keel) of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police is on a mission: to find Rose Marie Lemaitre, the daughter of a trapper who took sick and died at his post the previous fall and asked his commanding officer to assume her care.  He finds her, too--a buckskin-clad little wildcat (Ann Blyth) who begs him to leave her where she is (""I live in this country all my life, I love it here!""), and tries first to knife him and then to bite him when he insists that he ""has his orders"" and that a Mountie ""always gets his man--or woman.""  At first their relationship is rocky, but when Mike teaches her to ride, she comes to like him, and before long she's the company's mascot and mounted drummer, complete with full uniform.  Then their Inspector (Ray Collins) discovers she's female, and over her protests packs her off to Maple Rock to live with his cousin, ""Lady Jane"" Dunstock (Marjorie Main) and ""learn to be [a] woman.""  Again Rose Marie balks at first, but a meeting with trapper Jim Duval (Ricardo Montalban, and, yes, he does his own singing--his accent is unmistakeable) and the gradual realization that Mike is falling in love with her keep her in place.  Soon she finds herself caught between her feelings for the two men.  Then Jim is accused of murdering an Indian chief (Chief Yowlachie) with whom he had quarrelled over some tribal land he wanted to buy.  What will Rose Marie do, and who will she choose?Besides the wonderful voices (Blyth, like Keel, was a trained singer) and Rudolf Friml music, the movie's high points include the splendid location scenery and somewhat more of a story than many musicals have.  Comic relief is provided by Cons. Barney McCorkle (Bert Lahr), ""the Mountie who never got his man"" (if you acquire a copy of the full soundtrackRose Marie (1954 Original Motion Picture Soundtrack), you'll discover that a large piece was edited out, showing that he and Lady Jane were supposed to provide the secondary love story common in the genre).  I did find that my copy had a tendency to brighten and darken without warning and needed its volume turned up high, but as this series is made on demand, yours may not.  In any case, if you like musicals, this is one you should definitely have in your collection.",5,Beautiful songs and beautiful scenery,1360195200,"02 7, 2013",2013,2327,"['beautiful', 'Canadian', 'Rockies', 'late', 'Victorian', 'era', 'rugged', 'Sgt', 'Mike', 'Malone', 'Howard', 'Keel', 'Royal', 'Canadian', 'Mounted', 'Police', 'mission', 'find', 'Rose', 'Marie', 'Lemaitre', 'daughter', 'trapper', 'who', 'took', 'sick', 'died', 'post', 'previous', 'fall', 'asked', 'commanding', 'officer', 'assume', 'care', 'too', 'buckskin-clad', 'little', 'wildcat', 'Ann', 'Blyth', 'who', 'leave', 'where', 'live', 'country', 'life', 'love', 'here', 'tries', 'first', 'knife', 'then', 'bite', 'when', 'orders', 'Mountie', 'always', 'man', 'woman', 'first', 'relationship', 'rocky', 'when', 'Mike', 'ride', 'like', 'long', 'company', 'mascot', 'mounted', 'drummer', 'complete', 'full', 'uniform', 'Then', 'Inspector', 'Ray', 'Collins', 'female', 'protests', 'off', 'Maple', 'Rock', 'live', 'cousin', 'Lady', 'Jane', 'Dunstock', 'Marjorie', 'Main', 'learn', 'be', ']', 'woman', 'Again', 'Rose', 'Marie', 'balks', 'first', 'meeting', 'trapper', 'Jim', 'Duval', 'Ricardo', 'Montalban', 'yes', 'own', 'singing', 'accent', 'unmistakeable', 'gradual', 'realization', 'Mike', 'falling', 'love', 'keep', 'place', 'Soon', 'caught', 'feelings', 'two', 'men', 'Then', 'Jim', 'accused', 'murdering', 'Indian', 'chief', 'Chief', 'Yowlachie', 'whom', 'had', 'quarrelled', 'over', 'tribal', 'land', 'wanted', 'buy', 'What', 'will', 'Rose', 'Marie', 'do', 'who', 'will', 'choose', 'wonderful', 'voices', 'Blyth', 'Keel', 'was', 'trained', 'singer', 'Rudolf', 'Friml', 'music', 'movie', 'high', 'points', 'include', 'splendid', 'location', 'scenery', 'somewhat', 'more', 'story', 'many', 'musicals', 'have', 'Comic', 'relief', 'provided', 'Cons', 'Barney', 'McCorkle', 'Bert', 'Lahr', 'Mountie', 'who', 'never', 'got', 'man', 'acquire', 'copy', 'full', 'soundtrackRose', 'Marie', '1954', 'Original', 'Motion', 'Picture', 'Soundtrack', ""'ll"", 'discover', 'large', 'piece', 'was', 'edited', 'out', 'showing', 'Lady', 'Jane', 'were', 'supposed', 'provide', 'secondary', 'love', 'story', 'common', 'genre', 'did', 'find', 'copy', 'had', 'tendency', 'brighten', 'darken', 'warning', 'needed', 'volume', 'turned', 'up', 'high', 'series', 'made', 'demand', 'yours', 'may', 'not', 'case', 'like', 'musicals', 'one', 'should', 'definitely', 'have', 'collection']",N/A
1431498,A2BD0G4SRK0WMV,B004X63SFG,CodeMaster Talon,"[3, 3]","Having grown up watching the immortal Nelson Eddy/Jeanette MacDonald version of ""Rose Marie"", I admit to complete ignorance that a gorgeous, more faithful 1954 version existed. But lo and behold, this lovely musical has been unceremoniously dumped on DVD, and if you are a fan of golden-age MGM, you might want to pick up a copy.Based on a 1924 Broadway musical with music by Rudolf Friml, ""Rose Marie"" has been filmed three times, once in 1928 (with Joan Crawford!), the famous 1936 MacDonald/Eddy version, and lastly this film. Starring a perfectly cast Howard Keel and the also perfectly cast Canadian Rockies, the film is lush, tuneful, romantic and fun.Keel is Mike Malone, Canadian Mountie, lone wolf, and man's man. Ann Blyth is Rose Marie, orphan and wild woman living alone out in the deep woods after the death of her trapper father. Keel brings her back kicking and screaming to his Mountie outpost, where he proceeds to raise her as his own personal mini-me. This works out fine for a while, until his superiors notice he's got a woman dressed up as a mountie and good grief what will people say? So he packs her off to town ""to learn to be a lady"" and deposits her with Saloon Gal Lady Jane Dunstock, played by a barely used Majorie Main. Enter Fernando Lamas.Lamas is sultry French Canadian James Duval; shifty character, devil with the women, and secretly soulful. He and Rose Marie hit it off as friends the moment they meet, but it is during a robbery gone wrong that they connect as something more, in the film's best scene and one of my favorite scenes in any movie. Lamas goes to rob the saloon, spots Rose Marie in a beautiful dress making her debut as a lady, hijacks a dance with her, realizes he's essentially robbing her, and in a quietly desperate gesture gives her everything he has and everything he's dreamed of. It's just plain great screenwriting, beautifully acted. The rest of the movie veers along melodramatically until reaching a fairly satisfying conclusion, although how happy with it you'll be depends on whether you are for Keel or Lamas to get the girl.Stunning location scenery, classic music (yes, ""Indian Love Call"" is here), and a compelling story. I knock off a star for the wretched Native American ""dance"" (which manages to be worse than the 1936 version) and because the Eddy/MacDonald film is a little more close to perfect.Still reaching the stars and warranting:GRADE: B+",4,"""When you love someone, you know about them.""",1330992000,"03 6, 2012",2012,2423,"['Having', 'grown', 'up', 'watching', 'immortal', 'Nelson', 'Eddy/Jeanette', 'MacDonald', 'version', 'Rose', 'Marie', 'admit', 'complete', 'ignorance', 'gorgeous', 'more', 'faithful', '1954', 'version', 'existed', 'lo', 'behold', 'lovely', 'musical', 'been', 'unceremoniously', 'dumped', 'DVD', 'are', 'fan', 'golden-age', 'MGM', 'might', 'want', 'pick', 'up', 'copy.Based', '1924', 'Broadway', 'musical', 'music', 'Rudolf', 'Friml', 'Rose', 'Marie', 'been', 'filmed', 'three', 'times', 'once', '1928', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'famous', '1936', 'MacDonald/Eddy', 'version', 'lastly', 'film', 'Starring', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'Howard', 'Keel', 'also', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'Canadian', 'Rockies', 'film', 'lush', 'tuneful', 'romantic', 'fun.Keel', 'Mike', 'Malone', 'Canadian', 'Mountie', 'lone', 'wolf', 'man', 'man', 'Ann', 'Blyth', 'Rose', 'Marie', 'orphan', 'wild', 'woman', 'living', 'alone', 'out', 'deep', 'woods', 'death', 'trapper', 'father', 'Keel', 'back', 'kicking', 'screaming', 'Mountie', 'outpost', 'where', 'raise', 'own', 'personal', 'mini-me', 'out', 'fine', 'while', 'superiors', 'notice', 'got', 'woman', 'dressed', 'up', 'mountie', 'good', 'grief', 'what', 'will', 'people', 'say', 'So', 'off', 'town', 'learn', 'be', 'lady', 'Saloon', 'Gal', 'Lady', 'Jane', 'Dunstock', 'played', 'barely', 'used', 'Majorie', 'Main', 'Enter', 'Fernando', 'Lamas.Lamas', 'sultry', 'French', 'Canadian', 'James', 'Duval', 'shifty', 'character', 'devil', 'women', 'secretly', 'soulful', 'Rose', 'Marie', 'hit', 'off', 'friends', 'moment', 'meet', 'robbery', 'gone', 'wrong', 'connect', 'something', 'more', 'film', 'best', 'scene', 'one', 'favorite', 'scenes', 'movie', 'Lamas', 'rob', 'saloon', 'spots', 'Rose', 'Marie', 'beautiful', 'dress', 'making', 'debut', 'lady', 'dance', 'essentially', 'robbing', 'quietly', 'desperate', 'gesture', 'everything', 'everything', 'dreamed', 'just', 'plain', 'great', 'screenwriting', 'beautifully', 'acted', 'rest', 'movie', 'veers', 'melodramatically', 'reaching', 'fairly', 'satisfying', 'conclusion', 'how', 'happy', ""'ll"", 'be', 'depends', 'are', 'Keel', 'Lamas', 'get', 'girl.Stunning', 'location', 'scenery', 'classic', 'music', 'yes', 'Indian', 'Love', 'Call', 'here', 'compelling', 'story', 'knock', 'off', 'star', 'wretched', 'Native', 'American', 'dance', 'be', 'worse', '1936', 'version', 'Eddy/MacDonald', 'film', 'little', 'more', 'close', 'perfect.Still', 'reaching', 'stars', 'warranting', 'GRADE', 'B+']",N/A

We had very fond memories of it, but in spite of excellent re-mastering, the content was very flat and wooden. Ann Blyth, who we generally like very much, was hopelessly miscast, and the rest of the cast, including the great Howard Keel, found very little to get excited about in their roles.  Musically, apart from a couple of famous numbers, it had very little to offer.
