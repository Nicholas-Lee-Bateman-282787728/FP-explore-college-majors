But hey, this is a DIO recording, so I should be a bit screwed up to be watching/reviewing this.The good:  The video is excellent.  From the time period and since it's metal, not pop, to have a 16:9 video is awesome.  I don't think it was originally 4:3 and changed because it's not stretched or chopped at the top. I wish they could have had a better angle on the drummer, but that's probably more to do with the stage setup than anything else.  Way too much keyboard player which was annoying.The bad:  The DTS-HD surround track is awful.  No bass and no band in the surrounds.  Unacceptable.  Iron Maiden's recordings from the decade have more surround.  Listen to the LPCM track rather.  Has more bass and doesn't have the disconnected sound the DTS-HD does.For an historical piece it's worth the buy.  I love the back stage cut that has everyone passing a doob and cracking jokes. Awesome.  It seems like a bit of cash grab.  If Ronnie as still alive, a no brainer purchase.  To fund the lifestyle of his ancestors.....  well....",4,Good purchase for the price.

1645087,A3AA9B9U3PE3VQ,B00CA4S04C,Dave Peterson,"[1, 13]",I always found Dio to be corney.  Through his career he has made some great music but to me its a limited great.  Most of his best stuff is here minus some Sabbath greats.  So to me Dio will never get higher than a 3 on any album or video.  It's just my opinion.  Reading the credits on song writing is a joke.  Like I need a percentage of who get credit on songwriting.  I highly doubt the accuracy.

The show is excellent, the music selection is great and the band at the peak of their performances. Forget about those annoying cel phones and flashlights in the audience, this is the 80s and everyone is focused on enjoying the show ....period. The bluray transfer is great although there are some grainy parts, but not a big deal.  One CON I did find, and understandable, is the abuse of keyboards. Of course, this is 1986 and found them great back then, but not anymore.  DIO's vocals are amazing, this is a top notch performance for him and his vocals stood proud and got immortalized in this concert.  This is a masterpiece, nothing short of that can be said.
