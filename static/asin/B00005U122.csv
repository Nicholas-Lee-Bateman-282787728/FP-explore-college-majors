682705,A1BJOEQSRX2IBM,B00005U122,"Bertin Ramirez ""justareviewer""","[4, 7]","In The Flesh is a world tour Roger Waters will be finishing this June, and while he was visiting the states, he releases a double cd and a DVD.Both are divided in an all Floyd half, and the other one is a half-floyd, half solo career and a new song.Here are the pros and cons of In The Flesh DVD:Pros:- I actually found the DVD at a cheaper price than the cds.- The Band (Snowy White, Doyle Braham II, Fairweather Low, The 3 singing chicks....) are awesome throughout.- The sound on the DVD and on the tour is tremendous, and I was glad that acute attention was paid to every little sound effect from the albums.- Once you 'get over' the fact that there's no dave (guitar and vocals), no Rick and no Nick, you can really appreciate what these talented group of musicians are doing.- The concert starts off with a bang with 'In The Flesh'. A song which I always thought would be the best concert opener. Followed by a tight rendition of 'Happiest Days Of Our Lives' and 'Another Brick In The Wall Part 2'. This section along with 'Mother' almost made me cry. 'Happiest Days' is great and Waters adds even the slightest sound effects from the original songs (Hey you, stand still laddy). ABITW 2 is different, hearing the 3 women sing we don't need no education was a shock.But once you get into Waters gimmick of having them as back-up vocals so as his voice wont sound as weak, you find they actually add to a lot to the songs.- Next is a mellow and heartfelt perfomance of 'Mother'. Roger actually plays the guitar in this one. Dave's lyrics (mother) are done by the three singing chicks, this actually feels at home since mother is a female character. Roger sings with a lot of emotion IMO on this track, beautiful end to 'The Wall' Section. In my opinion, adding 'Mother; was a very good choice.- Next off are 2 songs from 'The Final Cut': 'Get Your Filthy Hands off my desert' and 'Southhampton Dock'. Both are played and delivered beautifully but very short. 'Southhampton Dock' is particularly beauitiful. But all in all, a short section.- This is followed by 2 songs from 'Animals': 'Pigs on the wing Part 1' and 'Dogs'. 'Pigs on the wing 1' is short and sweet, followed by 'Dogs', now THAT was a gutsy move by Roger. 'Dogs' is cut down to size and some of the notes are changed, and Dave's lyrics are sung by the keybordist/guitarist (a very talented guy with a good voice), I can't remeber his name as of now, and he does a good job, but still, one can't help miss Dave's voice. Roger ends with his section of the lyrics. All in all, this was a tight and stupendous number, I was really glad he added this one on his tour.- This is followed by three songs from 'Wish You Were Here': 'Welcome To The Machine' was another very, very gutsy move on Roger's part. He sings it nicely, and they play it beautifully, again I was VERY happy he added this one along with Dogs, two songs I would have loved to see on PULSE.- Wish You Were Here is sung by Waters. I'm actually glad he chose to sing it himself, it's different but it still feels heartfelt. Next is 'Shine On You Crazy Diamond' which is all over the place, the sections are shifted but still, it IS a great song and feartures IMO Snowy White's best guitar work.- To top the first section off we have 'Set the controls for the heart of the sun'. This old floyd classic gets a welcome R&B; groove and a very bluesy sax solo (yes, sax solo) in the middle. I think this actually improves on the original, even though I still miss the original bass lines and taken as individuals, they both seem like 2 different songs. I still like the original though.- The second section starts off with a bang: 3 songs from Dark Side. 'Breathe' is surprisingly waterless bocally, so is 'Money'. But it was very brave of him to sing the first part of 'Time', when I heard 'Ticking away, the moments...' delivered by Waters, it sent shivers up my spine. This section is actually pretty tight and well played, Breathe is ok, Time is very well played (or immitated if you wish), but Money gets into this very welcome jamming section that gets the audience more interested and Waters' bass is better than in the rest of the concert.- This introduces us to 5 selections from Waters solo years. First off is 'Every Strangers Eyes' from 'Pros and Cons of Hitchhiking', it is sung very emotionally and the lyrics are so beautiful, it perfectly goes into 'Perfect Sense 1 & 2'.- Next off are 4 selections from Waters amazing 'Amused to Death' solo album. First off is 'Perfect Sense 1&2' that song seemed perfect for a live gig, and man oh man does it work. It really gets the crowd going and it's a real energy-charged section because it is followed with 'The Bravery of being out of Range' a real heavy song that is played and sung with a lot of energy.- This adrenaline infused section prepares the audience to withstand two mellow but beautiful songs. First off is 'It's a Miracle', if it didn't have such beautiful lyrics and Roger's emotion-driven voice, it would have ruined the tempo of the concert so far, but it doesn't. Next off is 'Amused to death' a gem from that album that is sung flawlessly by Waters and the female backup vocalists. Beautiful.- This is closely followed by the orgasmic section of Dark Side: 'Brain Damage'/'Eclipse'. This really builds in energy and explodes. By this point you can see the band is really into it and so is the audience.- This leads to 'Comfortably Numb'. David's part (Pink) is sung by Doyle Braham II. He does a good job but still... Waters' part (Doctor) is delivered perfectly and with amazing energy and precision. The solos of course don't compare and that's good because these guys don't seem to want to immitate Dave, but do their own stuff with the notes. Even though they needed two guitars to complete Dave's sound.* Doesn't compare to the CN on PULSE, but again we 'SHOULDN'T' compare.- To top it all off is a new song called 'Each Small Candle'. The first verse is a poem written by a torture victim. Really heartfelt lyrics delivered beautifully by Waters. Really is a ray of hope in contrast to Water's other gloomy lyrics. I'm glad he introduces us to this song on this tour.- By the end you get the sense that Waters isn't such a [jerk] after all. By watching the concert and him closely as well as the 20+ min. documentary you really get the idea that if Dave, Rick and Nick would get off their [rears] and propose something theyre might be a remote chace (2 or maybe 3/10 of a chance) that they might do something together.- Great image quality and the 20+ min. doc. is a welcome special feature, so are the stills and the band biographies. Did I mention the sound is awesome.Cons:- Why those two short songs in representation of 'The Final Cut'. Why not two of those 3+ min. masterpieces like 'Fletcher Memorial', 'The Final Cut', 'One of the Few', 'The Gunners Dream' or 'Not Now John' (now that would have been something!).- Why in the hell not play 'Pigs on the wing' extended 8-track version. I mean he had Snowy White, he was right there!!!The extended version is actually parts 1 & 2 united by a bridge solo played by snowy white, all in all a fuller song, that just aches to be played live.- Why only 'Every Strangers Eyes' from 'Pros & Cons', that album had so many good songs on it. Would have preffered 'Pros & Cons of Hitchhinking', 'Go Fishing', 'Sexual Revolution' among others.- No Radio KAOS??- Roger doesn't sing as much as we want him to, we know that he's got a weak voice by now, but still...- Guitar notes and bass lines are changed here and there, I don't really know if this is a con, but there's gonna be the usual guy that says ""hey he missed some notes on 'Dogs'"". Be open-minded, we don't want the same song, that's why we have the original album. Changes for live performances are 'almost always' welcome.All in all...Well worth owning. Is it as good as PULSE (the video, images withstanding)? Well no, not as, but pretty close.",5,"GREAT DVD, Great concert, Great Quality, Legendary Music!!!",1020556800,"05 5, 2002",2002,7959,"['Flesh', 'world', 'tour', 'Roger', 'Waters', 'will', 'be',

The video production of the concert is also excellent with lots of close-ups of the individual players - for example, of Doyle and Snowy when they're playing their solos.  Although I have a lot of respect for David Gilmour, his writing and playing, these two guys do some excellent jamming that fits in perfectly with the particular song they're playing at the time, especially on some of the old favorites like Money, Another Brick ... and Comfortably Numb.  Roger Waters put together a first-class group of musicians for this tour and they do a great job on all the Floyd songs. If you like Pink Floyd music, this is a DVD that you'll want to put on, crank up the volume and watch from beginning to end. Every cut is a winner.

And the abundance of five-star reviews I see on Scamazon causes my sphincter to wretch.  There are far too many people out there suffering from Paula Abdul's syndrome.  But this DVD is staggering in its brilliance.As a stoner youth, I ultimately shelved Pink Floyd for heavier stuff.  No particular reason.  But now in my later years, as a reformed Christian no less, I have begun to reacquire the catalog on CD and DVD (having previously owned only vinyl... and without a turntable for fifteen years).  One could dismiss my praise as fragile nostalgia... but this show is astoundingly rich.  There are so many great tracks here.  The metal-head in me loves the doom and the heaviness.  Worst of all - and I'm no fruit - I think I have a man-crush on Roger Waters.  What a handsome, talented bloke he is, up there in that spotlight with his bass, how cool!  I've never met a genius and I wouldn't use that description lightly.  But Waters is a genius.  I admire him greatly.  And his work - this piece in particular - brings me great joy.  So that's my perspective.

Fifteen of the 24 songs were from those albums.  The rest were from Ummagumma, The Final Cut, and Roger Waters' solo career.  It was good to see and hear Waters sing my old favorites.Overall I thought this was a pretty good DVD.  The video quality was good, but not great.  The audio quality was superb.  I enjoyed watching it and will watch it again.On the downside, I didn't like some of the renditions.  Welcome to the Machine was particularly jarring.  Sure, Waters was singing it, but the song sounded different.  Maybe it is just the difference between live and studio, but I did not like it.  Your mileage may vary.The visuals were OK, but not stunning.  They mostly consisted of slides playing on a large screen behind the performers.  There was not much of a stage show.Doyle Bramhall II played Gilmour's part.  Although he seemed to be a fine musician and singer, he was no Gilmour.  I think this was one of the hardest things for me to accept.  Comfortably Numb was just not the same.  Snowy White made an appearance during the guitar solo, which saved that track for me.  Norbert Stachel on sax was another noteworthy player.Overall, I did enjoy this DVD and am glad I bought it.

682727,A17D77DFID0GZG,B00005U122,"dsrussell ""greyhater""","[3, 3]","I must say that I thoroughly enjoyed this concert video.  Between this and Pink Floyd's PULSE, I couldn't be happier...Seeing and listening to IN THE FLESH brought back wonderful memories.  It was interesting to hear how different the arrangements were on a few Pink Floyd standards.  While I may prefer Gilmour's guitar playing (who wouldn't?) and Pink Floyd's arrangements of several of these numbers, Roger still made them interesting enough for me to sit up and take notice.  And let's face it.  Roger's material is pretty strong stuff.  Granted, he seems to be in a 60s/70s rut of sorts (still bashing the establishment, still ranting about war), but it doesn't make it any less powerful.My favorite part of the entire concert was when Roger played music from AMUSED TO DEATH.  His mixing of old material and his ""newer"" stuff was spot on and his backup musicians and singers were, for the most part, excellent (I immediately noticed Jon Carin -- a wee bit older looking from the 1994 PULSE concert).  It is very evident from this dvd that Roger Waters (like David Gilmour and Pink Floyd) knows how to put on a concert...So if you are thinking about purchasing this dvd, do NOT hesitate.

Pink Floyd's only DVD release to date (and probably ever) is Pompeii, like it or not. Pulse and Thunder is what is left off Pink Floyd since Waters left. They were nice enough, I have them both on VHS, and I watched them from time to time.But this is something else entirely. The post-Waters era Floyd is a very good band but not a groundbreaking band. They made The Division Bell, a great album by today standards, but they no longer make cult records. Waters, on the other hand, made Amused to Death, maybe his greatest achivement ever, maybe greater than The Wall or Dark Side.And this DVD is the testament to his present status. Of course, you already read a thousand reviews praising the sound quality as well as the cristal clear picture. Of couse you did! It is even better than they say, and I can only add that you must experience this video, reading is no more than a mere prologue to it.I might add that the visual direction is incredible, maybe one of the best ever. And the set list is a knock out. Now, some people complained about some changes in the performances (an electric guitar on Wish You Were Here, Waters singing Time, band members singing Money, Dogs, and etc). You know what? It actually makes it better! You already have those versions on the albums! Why make a copy when you don't have the original elements. Gilmour is not here, so you have to play and sing his parts somehow. So Waters reinvented them, and they work! They are just different ways to approach the songs.Also, the songs from his solo albums are beautifully executed, specially the one from Pros And Cons, since it is also very different and much more emotional.Truth be told, when you watch Pulse, you can feel something missing. It is good, mostly because of the show and the musicianship, and a fine rendition. But something quintessencial is absent. Of course, you guess it's Waters. But when you watch this DVD, you don't feel that. You will find it compelling the first time, and by the third, you won't even think of Gilmour and company. This is Roger Waters, this is his show and he is in peak condition. Everything is flawless from start to finish, and nothing ever felt truer to the real Pink Floyd live of the late seventies.My advide is, if you love classic PF, and that means Animals, WYWH, Dark Side, The Wall among others, this DVD is for you, if you can handle the fact that PF no longer exists. But Waters is out there, writing great songs and brilliant lyrics still. And now he proves that he is a great live performer as well.Words can't do this one justice.

Roger Waters and his ensemble stunned witnesses to his ""In The Flesh"" concert tour across America and this DVD enhances that experience with revealing camera work of the performers and considerable attention to the super-wide Waters-like images that backed the stage. At the center of the stage Waters looked humble, as if unaware of the devotion and and gratitude the fans offer him, acknowledging them with a shy but commanding stage presence as if he was doing nothing more than offering them a beer. He and his ensemble became a dynamic collective force blasting out a unity heralding Water's solo career with each member becoming an integral component to the astounding musical package. Andy Fairweather Low's blazing guitar solo during ""Money"", Jon Carin's letter perfect vocal rendition on ""Dogs"", Doyle Bramhall II's constant virtuosity in interpreting Pink Floyd and David Gilmour's lead guitar work; all these performances and the rest of the musical cast brilliantly recreated Water's and Pink Floyd's music. I was reminded while watching this how much alt-music fans have to be thankful for in Roger Waters. His is a humane and intelligent delving into the psyche, questioning where we came from and fearing where we might go but always with a respect for the weakest human condition. He has remained consistent, alternative, stimulating, and challenging at a time when most contemporaries will abandon their past for the lure of a hit record. At the outdoor venue where I saw this show live, to the dismay of thousands of concert-goers, dark rain clouds threatened the sky just prior to the scheduled time, and as if on cue, to the cheers of the crowd a sudden rainbow dissipated the grey clouds like a Pink Floyd album cover just before Waters made his entrance.

This DVD displays Waters' mastery of the visualization which give purchase to his poignant, intelligent lyrics and melodies.

Well, once the DVD was released I popped it in my player not really knowing what to expect musically or visualy, now all I can say is...WOW!!! This is an EXCEPTIONAL concert DVD with detailed, crystal-clear audio (perhaps the best I've ever heard), excellent stage visuals, creative direction and camera work, and of course, an EXCELLENT band of musicians that really breathe new life into Waters/Floyd's music! Snowy White, Doyle Bramhall II, and Andy Fairweather Low make for a fine guitar trio, more than covering for the absence of the David Gilmore's, Eric Clapton's, and Jeff Beck's who played on the original versions of these songs. The keyboard work of Andy Wallace and Jon Carin captures all of those little details and ""nuances"" from the old Pink Floyd recordings. Graham Broad is a strong, dynamic drummer (superior to Pink Floyd's Nick Mason in my opionion), and the three female backing vocalist really help to beef-up the arrangements on several occassions - in fact, the Floyd classic ""Mother"" seems all the more appropriate with a woman's voice singing the chorus! As the master of ceremonies, Roger Waters mans his bass guitar for most of the show (occassionaly strumming rhythm guitar while Fairwheather Low handles bass duties), and his dark, unique voice (although some may criticize it's lack of range) bristles with real emotion and energy here...it's obvious that Roger FEELS the words as he sings them! Being a fan and follower of Waters solo career, I was quite happy to see several songs from his excellent ""Amused To Death"" album included here (""Perfect Sense"", ""The Bravery of Being Out of Range"", ""It's A Miracle"", and the title track), these songs are probably the highlight of the show for me - and the strong anti-war messages of the ""Amused To Death"" songs seem all the more relevent and thought-provoking when listened to in post-September 11th America! (Although sometimes seen as a ""ranting radical"", Waters is probably one of the most wise and brave voices in music today; using his art to promote peaceful solutions to the world's ills...instead of the mindless jingo-ism of, say, Paul McCartney's popular pro-war jingle ""Freedom""!) Of the extensive Pink Floyd material covered here one big highlight was the emotion-packed full-length version of ""Dogs"" - this version even includes the atmospheric keyboard/drum duet in the middle, and surpasses the excellence of the original studio version in my opinion! I also felt that ""Set Control For the Heart of the Sun"" sounded more bright and vital here than I've ever heard it before. Some other Floyd highlights (for me at least) would have to include ""Shine On You Crazy Diamond"", ""Time"", ""Southhampton Dock"", and ""Mother""...I only wish that ""The Final Cut"" would have been included right after ""Southhampton"", like it is on the original album! For an encore we are treated to a new Waters song, titled ""Each Small Candle"". The lyrics of ""Candle"" are a thoughtfully-crafted call to wage mercy instead of fear, and peace instead of war; and the darkly-colored music adds intensity to the message, and grows stronger with repeated listens. Do I have any criticisms of this DVD? Well, I would have liked to have heard MORE of Waters solo material (nothing is featured here from ""Radio KAOS"", and only one track is featured from ""Pros and Cons of Hitchhiking""), since there seems to be a very uneven balance between Floyd and solo tracks here (around 90 minutues of Floyd, but only 45 minutes or so of Roger's solo work.) There are already several high-quality official live recordings of MOST of these Floyd classics - but Roger's live solo work is much more of rariety, isn't it? However, any small disappointment aside; this is an EXCELLENT concert DVD, and should NOT be missed by any Roger Waters fan!

The treatments of venerable classics like ""Shine on you Crazy Diamond"" and ""Money"" are livelier and bluesier than David Gilmour's more formal, true-to-the-studio versions.  The three female vocalists are stunning:  I never liked ""Mother"" that much until I heard the soloist perform here, proving once again that it's the singer, not the song.  The guitar heroics are absolutely spectacular and there's real chemistry among the band members.I know nothing about the bitter feud between Roger Waters and his former band, and it hardly matters to me, but if playing well is the best revenge, Waters triumphs here.

682752,A3QWNQ2WA7QZYJ,B00005U122,kireviewer,"[17, 19]","This is a DVD from Roger Waters 2000 concert tour.  The music itself is about 2 and a half hours long.  It has the exact same track listing as the 2 CD set of the same name.  For special features, there is a very short biography on each member of the band, a gallery of still pictures and a 15 minute video of the group preparing for the tour.  The video isn't very insightful, except that it shows how well scripted the concert is.  Even the ""thank yous"" between songs are planned in advance.The is a very good DVD, but it isn't the best concert DVD I have seen.  For instance, King Crimson's Deja Vroom is better technically, artistically and has better features.  In The Flesh does come in stereo or Dolby 5.1.  The sound quality is excellent.  The picture is high resolution, but the camera work isn't that spectacular. It doesn't give you that feeling of being immersed in the concert.  It is more like you are sitting in the back row. The camera focuses on the wrong parts of the groups and the wrong time.  Someone will be doing a solo, while someone else is featured in the video.But, the important thing on a concert video is how good is the music.  This is the second best live album put out by any members of Pink Floyd.  It is better than Pulse or The Delicate Sound of Thunder, and on a par with Ummagumma.  The best Pink Floyd live album is ""Is There Anybody Out There"".The unfornate thing is that none of the best Pink Floyd live material is available anywhere.  They were simply amazing and creative during the seventies.  They were constantly experiementing with the material.  Dark Side of the Moon was originally played as a suite called ""Eclipsed"".  Later, the group did a 60 minute version of Dark Side of the Moon, where they really strectched out the material in amazing ways (not like the lame version on Pulse).  Animals and Wish You Were Here were first played in concert before turning up on record.Roger Waters has done a better job playing many of these songs on his earlier tours in 1982 (with Eric Clapton) and in 1987. David Gilmore's solo tours were better than his tours with Pink Floyd in the eighties and nineties.There are some very good tracks on this DVD.  The real stand out is Set The Controls For the Heart of the Sun.  Then there are tracks that aren't that spectacular.  The studio versions of the songs from Amused To Death are much better.In 1999, Waters got up the courage to tour again. He was worried about touring again because his 1987 tour was a moderate flop, only half filling arenas. But it was different in 1987. He had just released the horrible ""Radio KAOS"", which turned off many fans. Plus, Pink Floyd was touring at the same time. It turned out that Waters played more real Pink Floyd songs, and did them better, for the most part.Now it is 1999. He just released ""Amused to Death"", which was the best Pink Floyd album since ""The Wall"". He had no competition from Pink Floyd, which hadn't toured in 5 years, and the word of mouth got out on how good his 1987 tour was. Waters rapidly sold out the small concert halls and had to switch to medium sized arenas.In 1999, his show was around 2 and half hours (slightly longer than 2 CD's). In 2000, Waters modified his set list. He dropped some songs and added a few others and ordered everything so it would now fit nicely on two CD's. The change was for the better. He dropped some unnecessary songs like the Powers That Be, but some good ones like Another Brick in the Wall Part 1 and What God Wants. But he made up for it with adding Set Your Controls For the Heart of Sun (the best thing on the CD) and the new song Each Small Candle (which is about 8 minutes long).For this tour, Waters has a good supporting band, of a guitar onslaught (three guitartists), keyboards, saxophone and backup singers. Some people complain because the guitarists don't sound like David Gilmore. Well, that is good. It adds new dimensions to the songs. When I buy a live CD, I don't want to hear a duplication of the studio song. When I want to hear David Gilmore, I will listen to the real thing.Waters does a nice job of playing the Pink Floyd classics, but he has done it better before. In 1987 he combined Another Brick in Wall Parts 1 and 2. Here he just does Part 2 by itself, leaving off the fantastic guitar intro from Part 1. His 1987 version of Welcome to the Machine was the best I have ever heard, with a very powerful machine driven beat. Alot of reviewers praise the version of Dogs, but I found it to be too close to the studio version to be anything special.There are a number of winners on this CD. Shine on You Crazy Diamond is especially good. I like that he plays it as a complete piece, as Pink Floyd first did in 1975. The version ofMoney is refreshingly different.In summary, this is a very good live DVD, but it could have been better. Too much of the material is too close to the studio version. Waters and Pink Floyd have played some of these songs much better in the past. The real treat would be getting Pink Floyd live material from the seventies. Before releasing Dark Side of the Moon, they had an experimental version called Eclipsed. After Dark Side of the Moon was released, they stretched it out to an hour in concert and played experimental versions of Sheep and Dogs called Raving and Drooling and You've Got To Be Crazy and were evolving Shine On You Crazy Diamond, with soaring keyboard solos.",4,Second best live Pink Floyd album,1030579200,"08 29, 2002",2002,5423,"['DVD', 'Roger', 'Waters', '2000', 'concert', 'tour',

This gives you a great performance of all the songs. I have only seen the video once but I agree with those who have comment on the good video and sound quality.Its hard to listen to the Pink Floyd tracks without comparing them to the original recordings or the most recent live recordings like Pulse. In this case, Water versions have a different light as he makes more emphasis on the vocals and less on copying the original feel or music note by note. Also, the band is made up of three guitarist that take turns in the solos and add their own personal feel to them.Overall you get the complete ""In the Flesh"" concert as it was presented live and recorded on the CD. As Roger Waters was a key figure in the Pink Floyd concept you are getting both an antology of Floyd material through his interpretations of songs like Dogs, Set the controls for the heart of the sun, Eclipse, Brain Damage and many other obscure tracks.

And I was (and still am) glad they went on without him. But I've got to say that after watching this DVD it becomes clear that Waters was the one with the creative vision for the band. This concert has a certain vitality that seems to be lacking in the glossier Thunder and Pulse videos. I even liked the concert's emphasis on the music rather than the light show. And the cuts from his post Floyd era come across surprisingly well. I say this as someone who never cared much for Roger Waters' solo efforts. However, in light of recent world events, his post Floyd songs seem especially relevant today. Of course it's always been apparent that Pink Floyd never had the same lyrical depth after Roger left the band.

Main reason I'm giving this 24 song concert DVD a four-and-a-half star rating instead of a five star one is simply because a Roger Waters live performance may just be impossible to capture on film. 'In The Flesh - Live' was recorded in Portland in July, 2000 - about year after I saw him play. Some commented that his show was merely an elaborate slide show just trying to ca$h in on the Pink Floyd name. I, for one really enjoyed (being able to add) the Floyd founder / former bassist to my concert roster. Although I've never gotten too much into his solo material, I felt that Waters had more than the right to get out there on the road to play to eager fans wanting to catch him on tour. Tunes I liked best were ""Another Brick In The Wall, Part 2"", the memorable ""Dogs"", ""Welcome To The Machine"", the Floyd gem ""Set The Controls For The Heart Of The Sun"" (alright - off Floyd's 2nd lp), the mesmerizing ""Breathe (In The Air)"", ""Brain Damage"" and the FM radio staple ""Comfortably Numb"". Recommended.Footnote: I saw Roger Waters this last fall out on tour - performing the entire set of 'The Wall' with his touring twelve-piece band. I sat in front row. Since he's 68 now, I don't know when (or if) I'll get to see him play live again. Would really love to catch him for a third time playing live. Don't you just dig these retrospect tours?

From Brmahall III on guitar, to Graham Broad on the drums, and of course the keeper of the Floyd sound John Carin is amazing. Roger choses a fantastic song selection, much better then seen on Pulse. His voice has aged, no doubt, but he still delivers a solid and inspired performance.All other directors should take note of this DVD. The camera does not jump every two seconds. You get to really take in everything that you are seeing. You really feel like you are in the front of the audience viewing this show live. I recently saw Waters on his current Dark Side of the Moon Tour and this really does capture what the live experience is like.If you are a fan of Floyd you need to get this DVD.

The sound on this is incredible, the songs are a mix of those I remember from back in the days of Pink Floyd but served in a new manner filled with excellent vocals and instrumentals from artists who were not a part of Pink Floyd. Roger Waters, one of the front men for Pink Floyd, stands strong on his own with the talents of these artists. The background visuals were stunning.I first saw this at a party and immediately asked the host for the name of the DVD, knowing that it was one I had to add to my collection. Well worth the money, it is a DVD I enjoy frequently. Roger Waters still has the voice and musical ability that leaves the viewer appreciative of his unique talents.

682769,A3TBM91S4SP0MS,B00005U122,Paulo Andre,"[12, 12]","Some love Waters and hate Gilmour. Others do it the other way around. I say love them both, because honestly together they've done some of the best music ever. In ""In The Flesh (Live)"" we get a great taste of the Floyd legacy, performed by incredible musicians who make this DVD as indispensable as they come.Starting out with the unavoidable ""In The Flesh"" and naturally flowing into more ""The Wall"" material (including what is probably the most heartfelt rendition of ""Mother"" I've ever seen), I think this show really starts to shine with ""Dogs"". You can't really tell this is a 17-minute epic, because it just flies by. What really struck me was Jon Carin's voice, the keyboard/guitar/lap steel player who just sits up there quietly doing his thing until this point and here unleashes a powerful, forceful tone. The musicians are all top notch, from the incredible stand-ins of Doyle Bramhall II (this guy is just spot on) and the classy Snowy White, to a brief appearance of Norbert Statchel on sax for ""Money"" and ""Set the Controls For the Heart of the Sun"", well... the list goes on. The background singers are beautiful and sing just lovely. The perfect backdrop for all that's going on around them.The solo Waters songs also get appropriate treatment, with highlights for me being ""Amused to Death"", ""Perfect Sense"" and ""Each Small Candle"". Finally, many probably agree that the highest moment of this show is undoubtedly ""Comfortably Numb"" with Bramhall and Snowy White trading back and forth parts of one of the best guitar solos ever laid on track.Technically, the image quality is excellent, and the soundtrack is crystal clear. I have absolutely no objections to the technical merit of this release. My only complain is the lack of extra material, which includes only an 18 minute documentary about this tour plus some stills and biographies of each band member. I'm still giving this 5 stars based on the sheer brilliance of the show itself, though.This is an absolutely must-have DVD.

682770,A23MZ9TBR8ZGQW,B00005U122,Peter H. Kistemaker,"[5, 5]","On stage Roger was joined by Doyle Barmhall II (guitar & vocals), Graham Broad (drums), Jon Carin (keyboards, lap steel, programming, guitar & vocals), Andy Fairweather Low (guitar, bass & vocals), Katie Kissoon (vocals), Susannah Melvoin (vocals), P.P. Arnold (vocals), Andy Wallace (Hammond, keyboards) and Snowy White (guitar). The saxophone solos on the tracks are played, in each town, by different people, because they couldn't/wouldn't afford a saxophone player for the whole tour just for one performance.  The DVD starts with In The Flesh , Happiest Days of Out Lives, Another Brick in the Wall (part 2) and Mother (brought tears into my eyes!), all taken from The Wall.The Final Cut album is represented by the lovely acoustic medley of Get Your Filthy Hands of My Desert and Southampton Dock.The Animals album is the next to be visited. It's a shame that Pigs on the Wing (part 1) is not played with the guitar bridge and flowing into Pigs on the Wing (part 2). It seemed appropriate to play it that way with Snowy on stage, but unfortunately only the regular first half is played. What comes next easily makes up for this minor letdown; a full version of Dogs, amazingly well played and with great guest vocals by Jon Carin. A highlight of the album! Next up is a selection from Wish You Were Here. After a fine version of Welcome To The Machine, featuring massive backing vocals, we get the re-arranged version of the title track Wish You Were Here as Waters also used to play it live during the eighties, again with lots of backing vocals. A nice, fresh version of a beautiful song.The version of Shine On You Crazy Diamond which follows is rather strange. Its starts with part 1 and 2, followed by 4 and continuing with part 6 and 7 to finally return part 5 and to the opening section of part 1. A good version nevertheless. The next is a Floyd classic, Set The Control for the Heart of the Sun. A great rendition complete with saxophone solo and a freaky middle section. Then follows Breathe, including the Speak to Me opening of Dark Side of the Moon. Both this song and the next one, Time feature Doyle Bramhall II on guest vocals, although surprisingly enough Waters has chosen to do Gilmour's vocals on Time himself, instead of the less powerful vocals that were originally done by Richard Wright. Although not mentioned on the DVD, Time does end with Breathe Reprise. Bramhall continues guest vocals on Money. The nice thing about Waters' versions of the songs is the even more extensive use of (female) backing vocals on various tracks. Not only do they compensate for a certain lack of volume in Roger's voice, they also add to the power of the performances. And then we get to Roger's solo material. First we are treated to Every Strangers Eyes. Without a doubt, Roger's vocals are no longer strong enough to reach these notes and volumes. We continue with a large chuck of Roger's masterpiece Amused to Death: Perfect Sense (part 1 and 2) ,The Bravery of Being Out Of Range, It's a Miracle and the title track Amused to Death. All songs are played very tight. The encores of the set list were Brain Damage/Eclipse and Comfortably Numb.The DVD closes with a new track, Each Small Candle. The song starts with the backing vocalists and a guitar solo by Snowy White. The song has the same feel as The Tide is Turning and the lyrics, of which the first verse was written by a South American who'd been a victim of torture, are very emotional. Later on the song gets heavier, owning to a more bombastic melody. All in all, this is a very nice package with an interesting mixture of classic Floyd tracks and great solo compositions. The sound is great and very dynamic and performances are of high quality as well.",5,Pefect Show Captured on DVD,1020038400,"04 29, 2002",2002,3733,"['stage', 'Roger', 'was', 'joined', 'Doyle', 'Barmhall', 'II', 'guitar', 'vocals', 'Graham', 'Broad', 'drums', 'Jon', 'Carin', 'keyboards', 'lap', 'steel', 'programming', 'guitar', 'vocals', 'Andy', 'Fairweather', 'Low', 'guitar', 'bass', 'vocals', 'Katie', 'Kissoon', 'vocals', 'Susannah', 'Melvoin', 'vocals', 'P.P', 'Arnold', 'vocals', 'Andy', 'Wallace', 'Hammond', 'keyboards', 'Snowy', 'White', 'guitar', 'saxophone', 'solos', 'tracks', 'are', 'played', 'town', 'different', 'people', ""couldn't/would"", ""n't"", 'afford', 'saxophone', 'player', 'whole', 'tour', 'just', 'one', 'performance', 'DVD', 'Flesh', 'Happiest', 'Days', 'Out', 'Lives', 'Brick', 'Wall', 'part', '2', 'Mother', 'brought', 'tears', 'eyes', 'taken', 'Wall.The', 'Final', 'Cut', 'album', 'represented', 'lovely', 'acoustic', 'medley', 'Get', 'Your', 'Filthy', 'Hands', 'My', 'Desert', 'Southampton', 'Dock.The', 'Animals', 'album', 'next', 'be', 'visited', 'shame', 'Pigs', 'Wing', 'part', '1', 'not', 'played', 'guitar', 'bridge', 'flowing', 'Pigs', 'Wing', 'part', '2', 'seemed', 'appropriate', 'play', 'way', 'Snowy', 'stage', 'unfortunately', 'only', 'regular', 'first', 'half', 'played', 'What', 'next', 'easily', 'up', 'minor', 'letdown', 'full', 'version', 'Dogs', 'amazingly', 'well', 'played', 'great', 'guest', 'vocals', 'Jon', 'Carin', 'A', 'highlight', 'album', 'Next', 'up', 'selection', 'Wish', 'Were', 'Here', 'fine', 'version', 'Welcome', 'Machine', 'featuring', 'massive', 'backing', 'vocals', 'get', 're-arranged', 'version', 'title', 'track', 'Wish', 'Were', 'Here', 'Waters', 'also', 'used', 'play', 'live', 'eighties', 'again', 'lots', 'backing', 'vocals', 'nice', 'fresh', 'version', 'beautiful', 'song.The', 'version', 'Shine', 'Crazy', 'Diamond', 'rather', 'strange', 'starts', 'part', '1', '2', 'followed', '4', 'continuing', 'part', '6', '7', 'finally', 'return', 'part', '5', 'opening', 'section', 'part', '1', 'good', 'version', 'nevertheless', 'next', 'Floyd', 'classic', 'Set', 'Control', 'Heart', 'Sun', 'A', 'great', 'rendition', 'complete', 'saxophone', 'solo', 'freaky', 'middle', 'section', 'Then', 'Breathe', 'including', 'Speak', 'Me', 'opening', 'Dark', 'Side', 'Moon', 'song', 'next', 'one', 'Time', 'feature', 'Doyle', 'Bramhall', 'II', 'guest', 'vocals', 'surprisingly', 'enough', 'Waters', 'chosen', 'do', 'Gilmour', 'vocals', 'Time', 'instead', 'less', 'powerful', 'vocals', 'were', 'originally', 'done', 'Richard', 'Wright', 'not', 'mentioned', 'DVD', 'Time', 'end', 'Breathe', 'Reprise', 'Bramhall', 'guest', 'vocals', 'Money', 'nice', 'thing', 'Waters', 'versions', 'songs', 'even', 'more', 'extensive', 'use', 'female', 'backing', 'vocals', 'various', 'tracks', 'Not', 'only', 'do', 'compensate', 'certain', 'lack', 'volume', 'Roger', 'voice', 'also', 'add', 'power', 'performances', 'then', 'get', 'Roger', 'solo', 'material', 'First', 'are', 'treated', 'Every', 'Strangers', 'Eyes', 'doubt', 'Roger', 'vocals', 'are', 'no', 'longer', 'strong', 'enough', 'reach', 'notes', 'volumes', 'continue', 'large', 'chuck', 'Roger', 'masterpiece', 'Amused', 'Death', 'Perfect', 'Sense', 'part', '1', '2', 'Bravery', 'Being', 'Out', 'Range', 'Miracle', 'title', 'track', 'Amused', 'Death', 'songs', 'are', 'played', 'very', 'tight', 'encores', 'set', 'list', 'were', 'Brain', 'Damage/Eclipse', 'Comfortably', 'Numb.The', 'DVD', 'new', 'track', 'Small', 'Candle', 'song', 'backing', 'vocalists', 'guitar', 'solo', 'Snowy', 'White', 'song', 'same', 'feel', 'Tide', 'Turning', 'lyrics', 'first', 'verse', 'was', 'written', 'South', 'American', 'who', ""'d"", 'been', 'victim', 'torture', 'are', 'very', 'emotional', 'Later', 'song', 'heavier', 'owning', 'more', 'bombastic', 'melody', 'very', 'nice', 'package', 'interesting', 'mixture', 'classic', 'Floyd', 'tracks', 'great', 'solo', 'compositions', 'sound', 'great', 'very', 'dynamic', 'performances', 'are', 'high', 'quality', 'as', 'well']",N/A

However in some parts, as in the awesome 'Dogs', I miss Gilmour very much (in the legendary 1977 bootleg, Pink Floyd plays an amazing live version of this song). But of course that is thing of the past and Gilmour is not an easy treat to imitate, it is very good to see this guys solo playing Floyd backed by very good musicians, is better than nothing; also, Waters' solo songs are excellent here, I recommend this DVD to any serious rock fan.Anyway let me tell you, I saw Waters live this year playing Dark Side of the Moon along with some songs of this In The Flesh set, and it was so much better than this DVD, in every aspect, specially sound and lighting with flying pig wandering over the city skies!

Of note is the Synth player/Acoustic Guitar/Steel Guitar Jon Carin, He does an excellent number from Animals. The Organ/Synth player is also good and of course RW on Bass.Of course RW's later songs kind of drag, they are just missing a kind of focus.I think DG, RW and NM did so much for his music, more than he realizes or gives them credit for.It's a shame he didn't perform Grantchester Meadows which I personally think was one of his best numbers.However of note:-Excellent Set Your Controls..., and some of my favourite of RW's numbers are the one's from Animals, Welcome to the Machine is also a highlight.Overall a good performance as RW pays attention to detail.",4,Good Quality Performance,1352937600,"11 15, 2012",2012,964,"['Roger', 'try', 'continue', 'Floyd', 'story', 'own', 'are', 'excellent', 'reproductions', 'favourite', 'PF', 'numbers', 'Animals', 'Roger', 'good', 'backup', 'band', 'Dual', 'guitarists', 'Snowy', 'White', 'Doyle', 'do', 'well', 'are', 'excellent', 'guitarists', 'own', 'right', 'imitating', 'DG', 'rifts', 'note', 'Synth', 'player/Acoustic', 'Guitar/Steel', 'Guitar', 'Jon', 'Carin', 'excellent', 'number', 'Animals', 'Organ/Synth', 'player', 'also', 'good', 'course', 'RW', 'Bass.Of', 'course', 'RW', 'later', 'songs', 'kind', 'drag', 'are', 'just', 'missing', 'kind', 'focus.I', 'think', 'DG', 'RW', 'NM', 'did', 'so', 'much', 'music', 'more', 'credit', 'for.It', 'shame', 'did', ""n't"", 'perform', 'Grantchester', 'Meadows', 'personally', 'think', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'numbers.However', 'note', '-Excellent', 'Set', 'Your', 'Controls', 'favourite', 'RW', 'numbers', 'are', 'one', 'Animals', 'Welcome', 'Machine', 'also', 'highlight.Overall', 'good', 'performance', 'RW', 'attention', 'detail']",N/A

Reardon ""Classic rock and old sch...","[1, 1]","In 1999, former Pink Floyd bass player/singer/lyricist Roger Waters went on his first US tour in 12 years and didn't know how well he would be received. Surprisingly, Roger did very well on that tour as his ex-bandmates were not touring that year. At the time, Roger was going to record his first proper live album but there was a clause in Roger's deal with EMI in Pink Floyd that he couldn't re-record his OWN songs after he switched to Sony worldwide.After Roger got the rights reversed, he set off on a second US tour based on the success of the 1999 leg and recorded and filmed the In the Flesh album/DVD, released in December, 2000 and December, 2001 respectively.Personally, I think he performed better on the second North American leg than the 1999 leg but in retrospect, the final show in Providence should have been recorded but you can wish in one hand and pour out the other.However, the performance is from Oregon on the DVD is good as it was that July night in 2000 I saw Roger.Roger has a competent band of musicians like drummer Graham Broad and guitarist Andy Fairweather Low but also guitarists Snowy White (whom worked with Floyd in 1977 and 1980) and Texan Doyle Brahmall II (sounds like Stevie Ray Vaughan IMHO) and keyboardist Jon Carin whom ironically played with the post-Waters Floyd in 1987 to 1990 and 1994 and has toured with Waters again in 2006 and 2007 and in David Gilmour's solo tour in 2006.The renditions of the numbers on In the Flesh don't sound too different than their studio versions (In the Flesh, The Happiest Days of Our Lives, Another Brick in the Wall(pt. 2), Mother, Welcome to the Machine, Wish You Were Here, Breathe, Time, Money, Brain Damage, Eclipse and Comfortably Numb) but some of the songs are slightly different than the way Waters' ex-colleagues played them (Shine On You Crazy Diamond and Set the Controls For the Heart of the Sun).Floyd fans are pleased to know that Roger included material from Animals (Pigs on the Wing(pt. 1) and a spirited Dogs) and The Final Cut (Get Your Filthy Hands/Southampton medley) which Roger's ex-bandmates don't play live (Animals is too venomous while The Final Cut is despised by Floyd members David Gilmour and Rick Wright).The bass player's solo efforts are represented as well, with spirited versions of Every Strangers Eyes, Perfect Sense (pts. 1 and 2), The Bravery of Being Out of Range, It's a Miracle and Amused to Death. He did The Powers That Be on the 1999 tour but dropped it in 2000.The DVD closes with the new track Each Small Candle which is a worthy song and sounds like an outtake from The Final Cut or Animals.On the DVD are a couple of documentaries and the picture quality is stunning!This DVD and its off-shoot CD is highly recommended.",5,Best Roger Waters DVD of the two out there,1198454400,"12 24, 2007",2007,2750,"['1999', 'former', 'Pink', 'Floyd', 'bass', 'player/singer/lyricist', 'Roger', 'Waters', 'went', 'first', 'US', 'tour', '12', 'years', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'well', 'would', 'be', 'received', 'Surprisingly', 'Roger', 'did', 'very', 'well', 'tour', 'ex-bandmates', 'were', 'not', 'touring', 'year', 'time', 'Roger', 'was', 'going', 'record', 'first', 'proper', 'live', 'album', 'was', 'clause', 'Roger', 'deal', 'EMI', 'Pink', 'Floyd', 'could', ""n't"", 're-record', 'OWN', 'songs', 'switched', 'Sony', 'worldwide.After', 'Roger', 'got', 'rights', 'reversed', 'set', 'off', 'second', 'US', 'tour', 'based', 'success', '1999', 'leg', 'recorded', 'filmed', 'Flesh', 'album/DVD', 'released', 'December', '2000', 'December', '2001', 'respectively.Personally', 'think', 'performed', 'better', 'second', 'North', 'American', 'leg', '1999', 'leg', 'retrospect', 'final', 'show', 'Providence', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'recorded', 'can', 'wish', 'one', 'hand', 'pour', 'other.However', 'performance', 'Oregon', 'DVD', 'good', 'was', 'July', 'night', '2000', 'saw', 'Roger.Roger', 'competent', 'band', 'musicians', 'drummer', 'Graham', 'Broad', 'guitarist', 'Andy', 'Fairweather', 'Low', 'also', 'Snowy', 'White', 'whom', 'worked', 'Floyd', '1977', '1980', 'Texan', 'Doyle', 'Brahmall', 'II', 'sounds', 'Stevie', 'Ray', 'Vaughan', 'IMHO', 'keyboardist', 'Jon', 'Carin', 'whom', 'ironically', 'played', 'post-Waters', 'Floyd', '1987', '1990', '1994', 'toured', 'Waters', 'again', '2006', '2007', 'David', 'Gilmour', 'solo', 'tour', '2006.The', 'renditions', 'numbers', 'Flesh', 'do', ""n't"", 'sound', 'too', 'different', 'studio', 'versions', 'Flesh', 'Happiest', 'Days', 'Lives', 'Brick', 'Wall', 'pt', '2', 'Mother', 'Welcome', 'Machine', 'Wish', 'Were', 'Here', 'Breathe', 'Time', 'Money', 'Brain', 'Damage', 'Eclipse', 'Comfortably', 'Numb', 'songs', 'are', 'slightly', 'different', 'way', 'Waters', 'ex-colleagues', 'played', 'Shine', 'Crazy', 'Diamond', 'Set', 'Controls', 'Heart', 'Sun', '.Floyd', 'fans', 'are', 'pleased', 'know', 'Roger', 'included', 'material', 'Animals', 'Pigs', 'Wing', 'pt', '1', 'spirited', 'Dogs', 'Final', 'Cut', 'Get', 'Your', 'Filthy', 'Hands/Southampton', 'medley', 'Roger', 'ex-bandmates', 'do', ""n't"", 'play', 'live', 'Animals', 'too', 'venomous', 'Final', 'Cut', 'despised', 'Floyd', 'members', 'David', 'Gilmour', 'Rick', 'Wright', '.The', 'bass', 'player', 'solo', 'efforts', 'are', 'represented', 'well', 'spirited', 'versions', 'Every', 'Strangers', 'Eyes', 'Perfect', 'Sense', 'pts', '1', '2', 'Bravery', 'Being', 'Out', 'Range', 'Miracle', 'Amused', 'Death', 'did', 'Powers', 'Be', '1999', 'tour', 'dropped', '2000.The', 'DVD', 'closes', 'new', 'track', 'Small', 'Candle', 'worthy', 'song', 'outtake', 'Final', 'Cut', 'Animals.On', 'DVD', 'are', 'couple', 'documentaries', 'picture', 'quality', 'stunning', 'DVD', 'off-shoot', 'CD', 'highly', 'recommended']",N/A

Simply if you are a Pink Floyd fan then you are also a Roger Waters fan whether you know it or not. I had the great honor of seeing Mr. Waters' first show at The Garden in NY. This DVD is a must for any fan. Since Pink Floyd has released two live recordings over the last twelve years, sadly sans Roger, it's only right and proper that Mr. Waters release a live recording of HIS music backed by a great band. I have been a big fan since '72 high school. This DVD is a true representation of the show I saw. They perform these pieces as well as his former band members did, I saw Pink Floyd in '88 and '94. Also some great work from ""Pro & Cons"" and ""Amused to Death"" etc. Thank you very much for this DVD Mr. Waters, your show was breath taking as is this DVD. Listen to the samples folks! One important thing is the way this show was filmed, no jerky jumping around that is common in todays videos. The camera focuses at the right time on each band member for a proper amount of time. Ms. Kissoon sent chills down my spine on ""Mother"". As mentioned by everyone else the band is just fantastic that is really what I think, oh by the way Rog is Pink.
