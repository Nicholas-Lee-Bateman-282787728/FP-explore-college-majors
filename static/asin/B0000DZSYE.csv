It is a wonderfully simple program; a sort of Andy Griffith Show foundation enlivened by modernity. We see an attractive barkeep who has vague qualms with the religion into which she was born begin to respect the new priest in town as he jockeys with his older generational priest-supervisor. Through this prism we can see what we want of Ireland's more recent development. The program encourages us to take sides between the traditionalist (sometimes selfish) church of the past, and a more lively (but less absolute) version of it, as evinced by this young priest from afar who stirs up this town a bit. It's not at all a religious program, mind you; just an overly unrepresentitive portrayal of idyllic Ireland in which you cannot fail to include religion. Full disclosure: I like this show, but I also have Irish blood. I say this because this really is a program which appeals to a particular sort of individual; to one who either has Irish blood and/or for those whom Ireland has some draw. Ireland has an inherent appeal to many such people from around the world. Even if you have never visited it, can you not right now visualize vast green fields and rolling hills bordered by stone walls, snugly cozy pubs filled with glasses of Guiness raised, and smiling faces? Of course, i'm exaggerating here, but you must grant that Ireland is a far more attractive place than many others, at least in a theorhetical quality-of-life sort of way. It's thought of as the sort of place where stress is not as prevalent as where one finds oneself; having a bygone character to it (notwithstanding this not to be as true in actuality, but like in many other things, imagination often persists over reality). If I am making any sense to you with this, Ballykissangel may be to your liking. If you are familiar with Garrison Keillor's pubic radio show, &quot;A Prairie Home Companion&quot; (saturdays 6pm across the USA), Ballykissangel is to Ireland what the fictional town of &quot;Lake Woebegone&quot; is to the American heartland. I recommend both. Both evince what a part of us long for (if you are a nostalgic sort of person, regardless of your age--even a 25 year old can long for previous eras) and even though such may not suit us, it does make us inclined to enjoy programs like &quot;A Prarie Home Companion&quot; and &quot;Ballykissangel&quot;. I hope this review of sorts was of use to you. Cheers!  P.S. If you do give this program a try and find it to your liking I'd like to let you know that the &quot;set&quot; of Ballykissangel isn't one at all; but rather is an one-street town (called Avoca) that was occassionally commandeered for filming so that you can actually travel to it! To have a drink in its pub, visit its church (as I have) and so on is a somewhat surreal experience; as you walk into &quot;the program&quot;, so to speak, that you have enjoyably watched from afar.

780400,A1FY6ETS4ZPCUE,B0000DZSYE,Mr. Mambo,"[0, 1]","And if you're an Irish family, all the better! I watched Series 1 last week and could not wait to get into the 2nd series. Our local library has copies and so we can rent them, but the series is so good you would be well-advised to purchase your own copies.The picturesque village and it's environs are enchanting and alluring, and the pace of life would be very attractive to some of us who've about had it with the rat race. Do not expect to hear any foul language or witness acts of gratuitous violence; more likely, you will find gentle jibes, imaginative pranks, plenty of self-deprecation, and loads of good, clean fun.Each episode has plenty of humor but you will also find pathos, bathos (not sure what the difference is between those two, but what the hey), angst, anger and conflict. In other words, just like life. We all have our foibles and frailties and all of them are on exhibition here. The young priest, Father Clifford, is such a straight shooter that he almost immediately makes a positive impact on the citizens of the town, many of whom are NOT devout churchgoers, but who regularly and enthusiastically partake of the ""sacraments"" served up by the local pub.The series does not duck away from controversy and tough subjects. One of the simmering undercurrents in the early episodes is the undeniable attraction between the boyish and clean-cut Father Clifford and the vixenish pub owner Asumpta Fitzgerald; she's no fan of the church and what it stands for, but she finds herself to be more and more interested in the young priest. You get the idea that it's Father Clifford who is in control; if he wanted to renounce his commitment to celibacy--even temporarily--and fall in love with Asumpta, she would not resist.You will grow to know and love the fascinating characters. If you can appreciate people with quirks and odd mannerisms and expressions, and you have a slightly dry and/or wicked sense of humor, you will enjoy ""BallyK"". A couple of similar series or films: the seemingly never-ending, gentle-humored British series The Last of the Summer Wine, James Herriot's All Creatures Great and Small, Monarch of the Glen, and finally, the wonderful Bill Forsythe film Local Hero, very similar, but with a Scottish setting, and chock full of interesting characters who do what they want to do and don't worry about what the neighbors will think. The sad thing is that all of these series are completely unlike anything you've ever seen on American television. Apparently the networks--for good reason--are convinced that American audiences will only watch sex, violence and inane reality programming. Can anyone ever recall a popular and long-running American TV series which did not contain any of those sensational elements? If we've ever had one, it did not last beyond the first season, due to low ratings, poor promotion, and consequently, lack of funds and good stories.If you cannot actually move to BallyK, you will at least want to visit Avoca to see for yourself the beauty of this part of Ireland.
