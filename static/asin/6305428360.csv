I stopped watching after 90 minutes, and it only went on that long because I was too exhausted to find the remote.Bernardo Bertolucci won an Oscar for directing THE LAST EMPEROR, and I don't know anyone who'd deny he deserved it. I won't. That was a fine film in many ways. But let me focus on just two ways. They're minor, but bear with me. Set design and educational value.Now let us move on to LITTLE BUDDHA. When a Tibetan lama dies, they search for the person into which he was reincarnated and give him the lama job. Okay. I've got nothing against the Buddhists, so let's pretend they're right.We have a little boy in Seattle who is the reincarnation of Lama Dodje. Well, I saw two other candidates, but there's no suspense in this. The cover has that little blonde boy amongst a bunch of shaved-head monk boys, all in robes. Plus, he gets way too much airtime. I stopped at 90 minutes, but I know he's the guy. There is no suspense.The parents in Seattle. If I didn't have the dialogue to guide me, I'd never know what emotions they're showing us. They cannot act. But to be fair, in this film, who could? They're an engine to drive the plot, and if there were any way the author could've made the boy an orphan who just appeared in Bhutan one day with no life prior to that, he would've done it. They're that irrelevant.The story, such as it is, alternates. The boy is obsessed with reading the book these monks gave him. About Siddharta, who we assume he's gonna try to emulate. We see the story, we see his lame life, we see the story, we see his lame life, etc. Finally, at last, eventually, after much stalling, he's in Bhutan. Yay!The sets were gorgeous. Same as THE LAST EMPEROR. And I assume the director/author (same guy) was trying to teach me something about Tibetan Buddhism which I already know. I studied world religions a long time ago. But, what is he trying to tell me? I don't know. He's barking with all he's got, but I don't know that Timmy fell in the well again. I came away from this knowing it's a ""message movie"" but with no idea what the message was.So, we have a movie with no character development, no witty dialogue, no plot, no entertainment value. And I don't get its message, which I assume is its reason for existence. Thus, I can see no reason to watch it. Instead, dig up your battered old copy of THE LAST EMPEROR and watch it again.

He looks bland whether he's enjoying pleasure or suffering pain. He already embodies Buddhist indifference before he attains nirvana.

I watched this movie when I was a teenager with English as my second language.  Maybe it was my age back then, maybe it was the fact I was not fluent in English ... Maybe I was not brought up as learning the teachings of Buddhism.  I was attracted to the movie but couldn't get much out of it.  I think what was truly missing back then for me was that I did not have a spiritual teacher to guide me through the background of Buddhism.Now, as a grown-up, as I continue learning and expanding my interest and knowledge about spirituality (including Buddhism), I found this movie's storyline is beautifully weaved to allow the Western World see the ancient wisdom the Tibet Buddhism is trying to tell us.  This movie is an extremely brief introduction of the whole new spiritual world.Although I have to admit Keanu Reeves has the facial feature of Siddhartha compare to other Hollywood stars, I was a little disappointed at Keanu Reeves' acting in this movie.  I couldn't really feel Siddhartha's spirit in this actor.  Siddhartha was in a mission to learn about suffering and helping us see the illusions we create in the world .... In search of the truth about the Universe.  But personally, I couldn't really see it in the eyes of this particular actor.  But I guess Siddhartha's life is probably one of the hardest to act on ... For, one has to have a deep understanding about Siddhartha's quest to free human beings from suffering ... which not many of us can truly understand that with our hearts.Buddhism is certainly not the only road to Enlightenment ... (Well, why are we on the road by the way if the teachings are about being fully in the present moment anyway, learning about the laws of impermanence and non-judgment?) But this movie certainly opened an alternative door for each of us learning about compassion and love to ourselves, others and the Universe.  This movie is brief ... If your heart is intrigued to learn more about this religion, go with your heart.  The United States is very much dominated by Christianity ... Yet, I hold the belief that Christianity is not the only truth.  It is the 21st century now.  Let us move forward and open our minds to different spiritual teachings before we shut any doors down ... Don't let judgment and prejudice impair our full ability to learn and value religious differences.  Let our hearts decide which belief system we choose to adopt as an adult.Thank you for reading.",5,Beautifully Weaved Story Between Ancient Wisdom and the Modern World,1147737600,"05 16, 2006",2006,2637,"['storyline', 'excellent', 'switching', 'ancient', 'story', 'Siddhartha', 'story', 'modern', 'world', 'struggle', 'opening', 'mind', 'hearts', 'alternative', 'spiritual', 'teaching', 'flawlessly', 'watched', 'movie', 'when', 'was', 'teenager', 'English', 'second', 'language', 'Maybe', 'was', 'age', 'back', 'then', 'maybe', 'was', 'fact', 'was', 'not', 'fluent', 'English', 'Maybe', 'was', 'not', 'brought', 'up', 'learning', 'teachings', 'Buddhism', 'was', 'attracted', 'movie', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'much', 'think', 'what', 'was', 'truly', 'missing', 'back', 'then', 'was', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'spiritual', 'teacher', 'guide', 'background', 'Buddhism.Now', 'grown-up', 'continue', 'learning', 'expanding', 'interest', 'knowledge', 'spirituality', 'including', 'Buddhism', 'found', 'movie', 'storyline', 'beautifully', 'weaved', 'allow', 'Western', 'World', 'see', 'ancient', 'wisdom', 'Tibet', 'Buddhism', 'trying', 'tell', 'movie', 'extremely', 'brief', 'introduction', 'whole', 'new', 'spiritual', 'world.Although', 'have', 'admit', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'facial', 'feature', 'Siddhartha', 'compare', 'other', 'Hollywood', 'stars', 'was', 'little', 'disappointed', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'acting', 'movie', 'could', ""n't"", 'really', 'feel', 'Siddhartha', 'spirit', 'actor', 'Siddhartha', 'was', 'mission', 'learn', 'suffering', 'helping', 'see', 'illusions', 'create', 'world', 'search', 'truth', 'Universe', 'personally', 'could', ""n't"", 'really', 'see', 'eyes', 'particular', 'actor', 'guess', 'Siddhartha', 'life', 'probably', 'one', 'hardest', 'act', 'one', 'have', 'deep', 'understanding', 'Siddhartha', 'quest', 'free', 'human', 'beings', 'suffering', 'not', 'many', 'can', 'truly', 'understand', 'hearts.Buddhism', 'certainly', 'not', 'only', 'road', 'Enlightenment', 'Well', 'why', 'are', 'road', 'way', 'teachings', 'are', 'being', 'fully', 'present', 'moment', 'anyway', 'learning', 'laws', 'impermanence', 'non-judgment', 'movie', 'certainly', 'opened', 'alternative', 'door', 'learning', 'compassion', 'love', 'ourselves', 'others', 'Universe', 'movie', 'brief', 'heart', 'intrigued', 'learn', 'more', 'religion', 'go', 'heart', 'United', 'States', 'very', 'much', 'dominated', 'Christianity', 'Yet', 'hold', 'belief', 'Christianity', 'not', 'only', 'truth', '21st', 'century', 'now', 'Let', 'move', 'forward', 'open', 'minds', 'different', 'spiritual', 'teachings', 'shut', 'doors', 'down', 'Do', ""n't"", 'let', 'judgment', 'prejudice', 'impair', 'full', 'ability', 'learn', 'value', 'religious', 'differences', 'Let', 'hearts', 'decide', 'belief', 'system', 'choose', 'adopt', 'adult.Thank', 'reading']",N/A
464686,A1PASRZ81DY9C,6305428360,Austin Somlo,"[0, 1]","Viewed: 5/13Rate: 55/13: I am not sure why I have not heard of Little Buddha before until I came across it on a queue from Netflix. Seeing how it failed box office-wise, I thought it was the kind of a film that would do well regardless. Most reviewers gave the film a poor rating because of Keanu Reeves. That has been the easiest pinata to attack upon whenever a reason needs to be found. In reality, as many films as I have seen Keanu Reeves star in, he is an exceptional actor who has given credible performances. But he is not the reason why Little Buddha doesn't work. In fact, he only has a minimal amount of screen time. On the other hand, Bernardo Bertolucci means excellence in film. It is true when watching Little Buddha but only on the surface. He recycles the same techniques from The Last Emperor. But in Little Buddha, Bernardo gets overambitious and loses control of the film when it becomes clear that the story is about the chosen three spoiled, undeserving kids. It becomes comical when one of them is a white American kid (will never happen in the history of Buddhism). Once the retelling of the story about Siddhartha begins to fade away, there goes the film. The only reason why I decided on a `5' for Little Buddha is because of the wonderful cinematography. Like I write that Bernardo Bertolucci means excellence in film, it also means visionary genius. There are many shots in Little Buddha that are amazing and unconventional. I haven't seen a film being photographed the way it was in Little Buddha except for The Last Emperor. While I highly praise the cinematography of the film, the truth is that the story had so little substance that I was yearning for the film to end. It left me wanting more out of the religion, the story, and the characters. What is the film telling the audience? Why is there no sign of transformation in the white boy? What does the trip to Nepal do for the father? What is that all about with Evan? I think the mother should have went instead of him because she looks more interested. Anyway, as bad as Bridget Fonda is as an actress, it is amusing for me to see her to hold up with the grand scheme of things by allowing her glasses to act as a life preserver. All in all, the overly ambitious Little Buddha is worth watching mainly for its cinematography.",3,Too Ambitious.,1367798400,"05 6, 2013",2013,2313,"['Viewed', '5/13Rate', '55/13', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'why', 'have', 'not', 'heard', 'Little', 'Buddha', 'came', 'queue', 'Netflix', 'Seeing', 'how', 'failed', 'box', 'office-wise', 'thought', 'was', 'kind', 'film', 'would', 'do', 'well', 'regardless', 'Most', 'reviewers', 'gave', 'film', 'poor', 'rating', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'been', 'easiest', 'pinata', 'attack', 'whenever', 'reason', 'be', 'found', 'reality', 'many', 'films', 'have', 'seen', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'star', 'exceptional', 'actor', 'who', 'given', 'credible', 'performances', 'not', 'reason', 'why', 'Little', 'Buddha', ""n't"", 'work', 'fact', 'only', 'minimal', 'amount', 'screen', 'time', 'other', 'hand', 'Bernardo', 'Bertolucci', 'excellence', 'film', 'true', 'when', 'watching', 'Little', 'Buddha', 'only', 'surface', 'same', 'techniques', 'Last', 'Emperor', 'Little', 'Buddha', 'Bernardo', 'overambitious', 'control', 'film', 'when', 'clear', 'story', 'chosen', 'three', 'spoiled', 'undeserving', 'kids', 'comical', 'when', 'one', 'white', 'American', 'kid', 'will', 'never', 'happen', 'history', 'Buddhism', 'retelling', 'story', 'Siddhartha', 'fade', 'away', 'film', 'only', 'reason', 'why', 'decided', '5', 'Little', 'Buddha', 'wonderful', 'cinematography', 'write', 'Bernardo', 'Bertolucci', 'excellence', 'film', 'also', 'visionary', 'genius', 'are', 'many', 'shots', 'Little', 'Buddha', 'are', 'amazing', 'unconventional', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'film', 'being', 'photographed', 'way', 'was', 'Little', 'Buddha', 'Last', 'Emperor', 'highly', 'praise', 'cinematography', 'film', 'truth', 'story', 'had', 'so', 'little', 'substance', 'was', 'yearning', 'film', 'end', 'left', 'wanting', 'more', 'religion', 'story', 'characters', 'What', 'film', 'telling', 'audience', 'Why', 'there', 'sign', 'transformation', 'white', 'boy', 'What', 'trip', 'Nepal', 'do', 'father', 'What', 'Evan', 'think', 'mother', 'should', 'have', 'went', 'instead', 'more', 'interested', 'Anyway', 'as', 'bad', 'Bridget', 'Fonda', 'actress', 'amusing', 'see', 'hold', 'up', 'grand', 'scheme', 'things', 'allowing', 'glasses', 'act', 'life', 'preserver', 'overly', 'ambitious', 'Little', 'Buddha', 'worth', 'watching', 'mainly', 'cinematography']",N/A

The story is used not only for the individual incident but as an allegory for today's Tibetan (there are many other types) Buddhist way of thought.These are not two parallel stories in contrast.

This is the question that must ultimately be answered by a young American family when a group of crimson robed Tibetan monks unexpectedly appear on the front porch of their upper-class Seattle residence. Dean and Lisa Conrad (Chris Isaak and Bridget Fonda), the parents of a bright, inquistive boy named Jesse (Alex Wiesendanger) are faced with the possibility that their son may be the reincarnated soul of a revered Tibetan Lama. At least that's what they've been told by this group of monks recently relocated to downtown Seattle.Just before leaving Lama Norbu (Ying Ruocheng) presents Jesse with a gift, a book on the life of Siddhartha. In the days following this initial encounter with the religious leader of the Tibetan community Jesse begins to read about the life and deeds of the young Prince who would one day become the Buddha.From that point on the film shifts back and forth between the interaction of the Tibetan monks with the Conrad family in modern day America and the retelling of Siddhartha's (Keanu Reeves) life and journey to enlightenment in ancient India. This movement is flawlessly done by director Bernardo Bertolucci, adding depth and meaning to the rapidly changing events taking place in the life of little Jesse Conrad.An excellent movie on every level.

464692,A3VIOCJZ22JZXT,6305428360,C. B Collins Jr.,"[4, 4]","Some reviewers have come away from this film with the impression that it is an instructional film, letting English speaking audiences become aware of the basic story of the enlightenment of Prince Siddharta. Other reviewers have focused on the Seattle family which is transported out of their previous existance and culture into the possibility that their young son is a reincarnation of a holy LLama. Whereas I think this film does both of these story lines justice, I think there is a third story line in the film which is just as strong. This story is the quest by Llama Norbu for the reincarnation(s) of his teacher, then the death of Llama Norbu after his mission is accomplished, and finally the very moving spritual ceremonies at the end of the film where the monks mourn for Llama Norbu and the three children spread the ashes of Llama Norbu in Bhutan, India, and Seattle Washington.Bartolucci gives us first a story line that Western audiences can accept; a white upper class American family is moved from their everyday existance to another culture and belief system by a group of gentle Tibetian monks. Within this story line is a child's version of the story of Prince Siddharta, played by Keanu Reeves, relating the origins of the Buddha. However, cleverly hidden amongst these parts is the quest of Llama Norbu, played to perfection by the wonderful Ying Ruocheng.This is a beautiful film, which transports the viewer gradually and gently toward a exposure to the Buddhist faith.",4,A story within a story within a story,1168473600,"01 11, 2007",2007,1493,"['reviewers', 'have', 'come', 'away', 'film', 'impression', 'instructional', 'film', 'letting', 'English', 'speaking', 'audiences', 'become', 'aware', 'basic', 'story', 'enlightenment', 'Prince', 'Siddharta', 'Other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'focused', 'Seattle', 'family', 'transported', 'previous', 'existance', 'culture', 'possibility', 'young', 'son', 'reincarnation', 'holy', 'LLama', 'Whereas', 'think', 'film', 'story', 'lines', 'justice', 'think', 'third', 'story', 'line', 'film', 'just', 'strong', 'story', 'quest', 'Llama', 'Norbu', 'reincarnation', 's', 'teacher', 'then', 'death', 'Llama', 'Norbu', 'mission', 'accomplished', 'finally', 'very', 'moving', 'spritual', 'ceremonies', 'end', 'film', 'where', 'monks', 'mourn', 'Llama', 'Norbu', 'three', 'children', 'spread', 'ashes', 'Llama', 'Norbu', 'Bhutan', 'India', 'Seattle', 'Washington.Bartolucci', 'first', 'story', 'line', 'Western', 'audiences', 'can', 'accept', 'white', 'upper', 'class', 'American', 'family', 'moved', 'everyday', 'existance', 'culture', 'belief', 'system', 'group', 'gentle', 'Tibetian', 'monks', 'story', 'line', 'child', 'version', 'story', 'Prince', 'Siddharta', 'played', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'relating', 'origins', 'Buddha', 'However', 'cleverly', 'hidden', 'parts', 'quest', 'Llama', 'Norbu', 'played', 'perfection', 'wonderful', 'Ying', 'Ruocheng.This', 'beautiful', 'film', 'viewer', 'gradually', 'gently', 'exposure', 'Buddhist', 'faith']",N/A

On my first viewing, I would have agreed with other reviewers, that Chris Isaak seemed very ""Detached"" and it at first put me off. On further viewings however, I actually could see the subtle metamorphosis of his character.He is an engineer who is not only skeptical about the whole idea of his son being a possible reincarnation of a Tibetan Lama, but is also struggling with intense personal stress due to the bankruptcy and then death of his business partner. Looked at in that light I thought he portrayed the character believably.What's important to note is that as the movie moves on he warms up considerably to and has a deepening connection with Lama Norbu (whose character,is the central Tibetan Monk in the story, he is the one who is searching for his deceased teacher's reincarnation).He (Issak's Character) most definitely appears to start to appreciate the Tibetan Buddhist ideas as well. In fact in a subtle way he seems to start to heal from all the recent turmoil in his own life from his interactions with Lama Norbu and the other Tibetan Buddhist monks.I give this story five stars on many accounts. First, I love the story and the courage the director had to make a major film about something like this. Second, I thought the cinematography was beautifully done. Third, I personally thought that overall the acting was well done and that Keanu Reeves did a good job overall as the Buddha. In addition all the other actors, both the adults and children, came across very naturally in their roles.The actor, Ruocheng Ying, who plays Lama Norbu in Particular was outstanding as well as all the Tibetan actors, many who I believe are real monks (Sogyal Rinpoche for certain is not only a real Tibetan Monk but the author of ""The Tibetan Book Of Living and Dying"".Anyway, if this topic interests you, if you like movies like Kundun or Seven Years in Tibet, you will most likely enjoy this. If you are someone who has no exposure to Buddhism this is an enjoyable way to get a very basic idea of some of it's beliefs. Of course the Buddha's ""life story"" as portrayed in this movie definitely isn't meant to be a literal historical portrayal (particularly about his birth, with him walking and talking as a newborn).Still, concerning the Buddha, his teachings are what matters and not the ""cult of personality"". The Buddha tried very hard to instill in his disciples that his teaching was key and that he was not to be the focus of their practice, he was an example of how to live and practice, not someone to be prayed to.Namaste",5,Inspiring Story With Beautiful Cinematography,1103932800,"12 25, 2004",2004,2943,"['have', 'seen', 'movie', 'several', 'times', 'list', 'DVD', 'purchase', 'collection.I', 'thought', 'interweaving', 'story', '3', 'children', 'who', 'are', 'candidates', 'reincarnation', 'Tibetan', 'Lama', 'Lama', 'Dorje', 'Story', 'Life', 'Buddha', 'was', 'interesting', 'approach', 'thought', 'was', 'executed', 'successfully.I', 'also', 'thought', 'acting', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'overall', 'first', 'viewing', 'would', 'have', 'agreed', 'other', 'reviewers', 'Chris', 'Isaak', 'seemed', 'very', 'Detached', 'first', 'put', 'off', 'further', 'viewings', 'however', 'actually', 'could', 'see', 'subtle', 'metamorphosis', 'character.He', 'engineer', 'who', 'not', 'only', 'skeptical', 'whole', 'idea', 'son', 'being', 'possible', 'reincarnation', 'Tibetan', 'Lama', 'also', 'struggling', 'intense', 'personal', 'stress', 'due', 'bankruptcy', 'then', 'death', 'business', 'partner', 'Looked', 'light', 'thought', 'portrayed', 'character', 'believably.What', 'important', 'note', 'movie', 'up', 'considerably', 'deepening', 'connection', 'Lama', 'Norbu', 'character', 'central', 'Tibetan', 'Monk', 'story', 'one', 'who', 'searching', 'deceased', 'teacher', 'reincarnation', '.He', 'Issak', 'Character', 'most', 'definitely', 'start', 'appreciate', 'Tibetan', 'Buddhist', 'ideas', 'as', 'well', 'fact', 'subtle', 'way', 'start', 'heal', 'recent', 'turmoil', 'own', 'life', 'interactions', 'Lama', 'Norbu', 'other', 'Tibetan', 'Buddhist', 'monks.I', 'give', 'story', 'five', 'stars', 'many', 'accounts', 'First', 'love', 'story', 'courage', 'director', 'had', 'make', 'major', 'film', 'something', 'Second', 'thought', 'cinematography', 'was', 'beautifully', 'done', 'Third', 'personally', 'thought', 'overall', 'acting', 'was', 'well', 'done', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'overall', 'Buddha', 'addition', 'other', 'actors', 'adults', 'children', 'came', 'very', 'naturally', 'roles.The', 'actor', 'Ruocheng', 'Ying', 'who', 'Lama', 'Norbu', 'Particular', 'was', 'outstanding', 'as', 'well', 'Tibetan', 'actors', 'many', 'who', 'believe', 'are', 'real', 'monks', 'Sogyal', 'Rinpoche', 'certain', 'not', 'only', 'real', 'Tibetan', 'Monk', 'author', 'Tibetan', 'Book', 'Living', 'Dying', '.Anyway', 'topic', 'interests', 'like', 'movies', 'Kundun', 'Seven', 'Years', 'Tibet', 'will', 'most', 'likely', 'enjoy', 'are', 'someone', 'who', 'exposure', 'Buddhism', 'enjoyable', 'way', 'get', 'very', 'basic', 'idea', 'beliefs', 'course', 'Buddha', 'life', 'story', 'portrayed', 'movie', 'definitely', ""n't"", 'meant', 'be', 'literal', 'historical', 'portrayal', 'particularly', 'birth', 'walking', 'talking', 'newborn', '.Still', 'concerning', 'Buddha', 'teachings', 'are', 'what', 'matters', 'not', 'cult', 'personality', 'Buddha', 'tried', 'very', 'hard', 'instill', 'disciples', 'teaching', 'was', 'key', 'was', 'not', 'be', 'focus', 'practice', 'was', 'example', 'how', 'live', 'practice', 'not', 'someone', 'be', 'prayed', 'to.Namaste']",N/A

While the sets, costumes and cinematography of the period scenes are beautiful, the story is hopelessly muddled and sentimental, the Sunday-school version of the life of the Buddha preposterous.  Is anyone likely to believe that this effete Siddartha never saw an old or sick or dead person in his 28 years?  And that even if he hadn't, that such a person would, upon seeing such things, throw away a pampered existence to live in the forest with naked, starving, infested ascetics?The modern tale with which it is paired, the search for a reincarnated lama, is equally unconvincing.  At a suburban American playground a young mother retrieving her son is chatted up by a Tibetan monk in burgundy robes.  Uninvited the monk is on her doorstep the next day, in the company of another monk, and both are asked in for tea, as if they were old friends just popping by to say hello.  If you didn't know any better, you might get the idea from this film that Americans are by nature so unsuspecting as to invite stalkers into their homes.  Later on, though the parents admit to some suspicion about the monk's motives, and though neither one expresses any interest in Buddhism, they drop their child off to be baby-sat with the monks at the local Buddhist center.And when it isn't incredulous, the script is sometimes incomprehensible - the dialog leaves you to wonder if something hadn't been edited out.  The acting is stiffer than wood and the main characters simply annoying.  They're nothing like real people, just little puppets set up to keep the story moving.  The message of the film?  Have compassion for all living beings.  How can the average person achieve this?  Why is this a good thing?  Director Bernardo Bertolucci never gets around to it.It didn't help that I watched this film in the same week that I finisheda wonderful bookwith a nuanced depiction of the Buddha and his age.

The film is an extremely emotional film about the great spirituality Buddhism is. But it remains rather folkloric about Buddha's life and the middle way is an English translation that does not mean what the original words meant. Today in English it means the refusal to choose either one way or another and the fact that we are lacking the courage we need to face and assume both life and death because life is great and death is just as great, and life is bad and death is just as bad. Life leads to death through decay and pain. But life is also the promise of rebirth through karma and death. Death is bad because it is the result of decay and pain. But death is good too because it is the door to rebirth through karma and death itself. That's what the middle way means, not neither nor, but  both one and the other. There is some attachment, tanha in Pali, that has to be severed, to the middle way seen as an in-between and a non-commitment. You have to accept both sides of nature, the universe, existence, the beginning birth, the growing and decaying life, the ending death, and then if you believe in it the beyond of a new beginning in rebirth. The film is also by far too Tibetan. I am for the little chariot, the southern Asian Buddhism, not for the northern Asian Buddhism, and particularly not for Tibetan Buddhism. This last variety has replaced the non-commitment of Buddha to the existence of God, to the existence of a soul in man, a divine presence in that soul, and his commitment to the absolute absence of any permanence with a fetishized eternal not life but survival from one life to another. In other words nirvana does not exist anymore since for Buddha nirvana is the possibility to step out of the cycle birth-life-death-rebirth and the possibility to merge with the vast principle of universal existence. Nirvana has been emptied of its meaning and replaced by some kind of sainthood that peregrinates from one being to another. What's more the film insists too much on the rites and not on the social dimension of Buddhism. And this shows a social dimension that I had not found in the Buddhist temple I have visited and worked for. They do not teach to monks only but they have a teaching mission for everyone. They do not take care of the health of monks only but they heal and cure everyone. They do not help the members of the monastic community only, closed onto themselves as they appeared to be, but they help everyone in the community at large of which they are full members. In other words this film does not really give an image of the deep spirituality of Buddhism, the search not for one self because the self cannot exist since it is impermanent like anything else, but for the light that is hidden in the very middle of things. That's the best part of Buddhism, the meditation that enables you, through a slow and long learning process in which you have to be both guided and free, to dominate your feelings, your passions, your sentiments, your cravings too, without rejecting anything but by finding the just equilibrium that will enable you to enjoy beauty as much as not to be the slave of that beauty, for one example. Yes a Buddhist can enjoy music or flowers but a Buddhist will not become attached to these and forget that he has many responsibilities to himself, to his direct community, family or other, to the social community beyond and even to the world and the universe. The Buddhists I know are able to love other people and to feel and express deep feelings and yet to remain detached enough to be able to help the friend they love with the distantiation they and he or she need to find pleasure and control pain. That is the middle way too: enjoy the pleasure that will not bring pain and control the pain that may destroy the pleasure. To control does not mean to get rid of because it is impossible, to be indifferent because it is uncompassionate, inhuman, but to keep within some limits that will enable you to remain the main agent of your own life in symbiosis with those of your living companions.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine & University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne",5,Liberate Nirvana from unescapable reincarnation,1181174400,"06 7, 2007",2007,4312,"['film', 'monument', 'respect', 'owe', 'life', 'death', 'compassion', 'living', 'who', 'are', 'also', 'dying', 'respect', 'death', 'life', 'film', 'extremely', 'emotional', 'film', 'great', 'spirituality', 'Buddhism', 'rather', 'folkloric', 'Buddha', 'life', 'middle', 'way', 'English', 'translation', 'not', 'mean', 'what', 'original', 'words', 'meant', 'Today', 'English', 'refusal', 'choose', 'one', 'way', 'fact', 'are', 'lacking', 'courage', 'need', 'face', 'assume', 'life', 'death', 'life', 'great', 'death', 'just', 'as', 'great', 'life', 'bad', 'death', 'just', 'bad', 'Life', 'death', 'decay', 'pain', 'life', 'also', 'promise', 'rebirth', 'karma', 'death', 'Death', 'bad', 'result', 'decay', 'pain', 'death', 'good', 'too', 'door', 'rebirth', 'karma', 'death', 'what', 'middle', 'way', 'means', 'not', 'one', 'other', 'attachment', 'tanha', 'Pali', 'be', 'severed', 'middle', 'way', 'seen', 'in-between', 'non-commitment', 'have', 'accept', 'sides', 'nature', 'universe', 'existence', 'beginning', 'birth', 'growing', 'decaying', 'life', 'ending', 'death', 'then', 'believe', 'new', 'beginning', 'rebirth', 'film', 'also', 'far', 'too', 'Tibetan', 'am', 'little', 'chariot', 'southern', 'Asian', 'Buddhism', 'not', 'northern', 'Asian', 'Buddhism', 'particularly', 'not', 'Tibetan', 'Buddhism', 'last', 'variety', 'replaced', 'non-commitment', 'Buddha', 'existence', 'God', 'existence', 'soul', 'man', 'divine', 'presence', 'soul', 'commitment', 'absolute', 'absence', 'permanence', 'fetishized', 'eternal', 'not', 'life', 'survival', 'one', 'life', 'other', 'words', 'nirvana', 'not', 'exist', 'anymore', 'Buddha', 'nirvana', 'possibility', 'step', 'out', 'cycle', 'birth-life-death-rebirth', 'possibility', 'merge', 'vast', 'principle', 'universal', 'existence', 'Nirvana', 'been', 'emptied', 'meaning', 'replaced', 'kind', 'sainthood', 'one', 'being', 'What', 'more', 'film', 'too', 'much', 'rites', 'not', 'social', 'dimension', 'Buddhism', 'social', 'dimension', 'had', 'not', 'found', 'Buddhist', 'temple', 'have', 'visited', 'worked', 'do', 'not', 'teach', 'monks', 'only', 'have', 'teaching', 'mission', 'everyone', 'do', 'not', 'take', 'care', 'health', 'monks', 'only', 'heal', 'cure', 'everyone', 'do', 'not', 'help', 'members', 'monastic', 'community', 'only', 'closed', 'onto', 'appeared', 'be', 'help', 'everyone', 'community', 'large', 'are', 'full', 'members', 'other', 'words', 'film', 'not', 'really', 'give', 'image', 'deep', 'spirituality', 'Buddhism', 'search', 'not', 'one', 'self', 'self', 'can', 'not', 'exist', 'impermanent', 'anything', 'else', 'light', 'hidden', 'very', 'middle', 'things', 'best', 'part', 'Buddhism', 'meditation', 'slow', 'long', 'learning', 'process', 'have', 'be', 'guided', 'free', 'dominate', 'feelings', 'passions', 'sentiments', 'cravings', 'too', 'rejecting', 'anything', 'finding', 'just', 'equilibrium', 'will', 'enable', 'enjoy', 'beauty', 'as', 'much', 'not', 'be', 'slave', 'beauty', 'one', 'example', 'Yes', 'Buddhist', 'can', 'enjoy', 'music', 'flowers', 'Buddhist', 'will', 'not', 'become', 'attached', 'forget', 'many', 'responsibilities', 'direct', 'community', 'family', 'other', 'social', 'community', 'even', 'world', 'universe', 'Buddhists', 'know', 'are', 'able', 'love', 'other', 'people', 'feel', 'express', 'deep', 'feelings', 'yet', 'remain', 'detached', 'enough', 'be', 'able', 'help', 'friend', 'love', 'distantiation', 'need', 'find', 'pleasure', 'control', 'pain', 'middle', 'way', 'too', 'enjoy', 'pleasure', 'will', 'not', 'bring', 'pain', 'control', 'pain', 'may', 'destroy', 'pleasure', 'control', 'not', 'mean', 'get', 'rid', 'impossible', 'be', 'indifferent', 'uncompassionate', 'inhuman', 'keep', 'limits', 'will', 'enable', 'remain', 'main', 'agent', 'own', 'life', 'symbiosis', 'living', 'companions.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU', 'University', 'Paris', 'Dauphine', 'University', 'Paris', '1', 'Pantheon', 'Sorbonne']",N/A

And I absolutely understand why someone might completely adore this movie. But I think there is a real validity to some of the criticism made by other reviewers in regards to this film. I don't think these individuals are somehow phony Buddhists... and it would be rather hypocritical to take a 'Holier than Thou' approach, isn't it? (Or should I say, 'More Buddhist than Thou'?).What I mean to say is that criticisms of this film are valid, thought provoking, and allow viewers to enjoy/understand the implications of this film on an entirely new level. Here are some additional quotes, of people that said things much better than I could. I don't necessarily hold steadfast to all these views, but they are utterly thought provoking, and completely relevant:""The promise of film has been transformed into an astheticized folklore of phanatasmagorized exchange""-Anita Hill""Such tales are the architectonic machinery of the culture industry and have transcended their subject matter. They have fallen into the fetishistic apparatus of representation""-J.

In this context, certain notions of ?diversity?...are viewed favourable, both at home in Canada and globally""The film 'Little Buddha' offers us a fantastic opportunity to think about this commodification of culture, identity and religion, as well as its simultaneous exoticization. There's nothing inherently wrong about our tendency of consuming the exotic. There's nothing inherently wrong about this film either. As others and I have said, it?s just a movie. But I think what's important is the absence of alternative to the exoticized pageantry ""Little Buddha"" offers.And a comment about the film itself: I think what disappointed me about this film is that it felt hollow and a little two dimensional for my tastes. It left me wanting more; more story (outside the Lord Budda narrative), more depth, and stronger characters that I would have time to develop an attachment for.

I liked it, and  - since I saw it on television first - got through about half the movie before I recognized Keanu Reeves.  I saw it first on television in Malaysia.  To give you a thumbnail of the values system in a moderate Muslim country: Deep Blue, the shark movie, was run ""full blooded"" on television marked as ""suitable for all family members.""  This movie was run with a ""Parental guidance - some ideas may be unsuitable for some family members."" disclaimer.
