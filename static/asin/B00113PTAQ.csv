1129567,A1K5DUV1L52MUD,B00113PTAQ,"Bonnie Sayers ""autismfamily""","[9, 9]","This was developed specifically for children on the autism spectrum by parents and experts in Speech and Music Therapy.  It starts off with a nice jingle.The tunes are really catchy, the video is lively with many musical instruments being played by professionals. The setting is a club house where there is a schedule board with a large picture card indicating what is taking place and they have a circle time. Kibble is the stuffed dog that talks and has his own section after each lesson on the DVD. This is known as Kibbles world.The forty minutes goes by quickly.  There are professional musicians playing a variety of instruments like the violin, flute, cello and drums.  The best segment is an outdoor one where they sing about being calm, all dressed in white admiring colorful flowers in a field.  Very serene like and uplifting with the music playing.There are four kids portrayed in the movie representing all age groups and gender.  They have a schedule board they follow which utilizes big picture cards.  There are colored rugs, snack time and circle time.It is perfectly suited for the recommended target age group of 3-7.  The skills taught are reinforced with kibbles world, which is interactive having kids choose the corresponding picture or phrase that has to do with the lesson just taught.A fun engaging and motivating DVD plus the CD is great for listening at the computer or in the car.  Both are hits with my nonverbal son on the autism spectrum.",5,Expressing Yourself DVD/CD,1219968000,"08 29, 2008",2008,1470,"['was', 'developed', 'specifically', 'children', 'autism', 'spectrum', 'parents', 'experts', 'Speech', 'Music', 'Therapy', 'nice', 'jingle.The', 'tunes', 'are', 'really', 'catchy', 'video', 'lively', 'many', 'musical', 'instruments', 'being', 'played', 'professionals', 'setting', 'club', 'house', 'where', 'schedule', 'board', 'large', 'picture', 'card', 'indicating', 'what', 'taking', 'place', 'have', 'circle', 'time', 'Kibble', 'stuffed', 'dog', 'talks', 'own', 'section', 'lesson', 'DVD', 'known', 'Kibbles', 'world.The', 'forty', 'minutes', 'quickly', 'are', 'professional', 'musicians', 'playing', 'variety', 'instruments', 'violin', 'flute', 'cello', 'drums', 'best', 'segment', 'outdoor', 'one', 'where', 'sing', 'being', 'calm', 'dressed', 'white', 'admiring', 'colorful', 'flowers', 'field', 'Very', 'serene', 'uplifting', 'music', 'are', 'four', 'kids', 'portrayed', 'movie', 'representing', 'age', 'groups', 'gender', 'have', 'schedule', 'board', 'follow', 'big', 'picture', 'cards', 'are', 'colored', 'rugs', 'snack', 'time', 'circle', 'time.It', 'perfectly', 'suited', 'recommended', 'target', 'age', 'group', '3-7', 'skills', 'taught', 'are', 'reinforced', 'kibbles', 'world', 'interactive', 'having', 'kids', 'choose', 'corresponding', 'picture', 'phrase', 'do', 'lesson', 'just', 'taught.A', 'fun', 'engaging', 'motivating', 'DVD', 'CD', 'great', 'listening', 'computer', 'car', 'are', 'hits', 'nonverbal', 'son', 'autism', 'spectrum']",Kibbles Rockin' Clubhouse vol. 1 Expressing Yourself
1129568,AB43UAL8F1XR1,B00113PTAQ,Cynthia,"[0, 0]","This is a good dvd for children on the spectrum.  I find that it took my children a while to enjoy it and that the skills taught are aimed for higher functioning or older children because the teaching method is oral and not very visual.  The great thing about this video is that it comes with a cd so that I played it in the car and got my kids acquainted with the songs and that helped them to be curious about the video.  Though I found Angela a little stiff in the video, her choice of topics and her lyric/musical writing are very pertinent and catchy.  There are some very good moments, and Jareb is a natural. There is also helpful resource information for parents.  This is one of our faves so far!  At least download the songs!  Looking for more songs from Angela!",4,My kids love it,1288828800,"11 4, 2010",2010,772,"['good', 'dvd', 'children', 'spectrum', 'find', 'took', 'children', 'while', 'enjoy', 'skills', 'taught', 'are', 'aimed', 'higher', 'functioning', 'older', 'children', 'teaching', 'method', 'oral', 'not', 'very', 'visual', 'great', 'thing', 'video', 'cd', 'played', 'car', 'got', 'kids', 'acquainted', 'songs', 'helped', 'be', 'curious', 'video', 'found', 'Angela', 'little', 'stiff', 'video', 'choice', 'topics', 'lyric/musical', 'writing', 'are', 'very', 'pertinent', 'catchy', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'moments', 'Jareb', 'natural', 'also', 'helpful', 'resource', 'information', 'parents', 'one', 'faves', 'so', 'far', 'least', 'download', 'songs', 'Looking', 'more', 'songs', 'Angela']",Kibbles Rockin' Clubhouse vol. 1 Expressing Yourself
1129569,A3GX9QEY37BE1Q,B00113PTAQ,F. Johnson,"[0, 0]",I bought this video for my grandson who was diagnosed when he was two years old with slight to moderate autism. He is now three. His sister is four years old. Both of them love this video. It has helped the 3 year old mimic responses and try to use them on his own. He is saying Hi now. He was not before the video. His sister really can not get enough of the video. This video is  appropriate for pre-schoolers without autism. Both of my grandchildren love the songs in the video. They sing along with the children in the video. The calm down song really does put both of my grandchildren in a calmer mode. The lesson planning for this video is excellent. I actually enjoy it and especially the songs. They are simple and appropriate for the activity that the children are engaging in. The lesson planning and the music was well thought out. I like this video. I highly recommend this video. I cannot wait for the next volume to be released.,5,Kibbles Rocking Clubhouse (Volume I),1223164800,"10 5, 2008",2008,942,"['bought', 'video', 'grandson', 'who', 'was', 'diagnosed', 'when', 'was', 'two', 'years', 'old', 'slight', 'moderate', 'autism', 'now', 'three', 'sister', 'four', 'years', 'old', 'love', 'video', 'helped', '3', 'year', 'old', 'mimic', 'responses', 'try', 'use', 'own', 'saying', 'Hi', 'now', 'was', 'not', 'video', 'sister', 'really', 'can', 'not', 'get', 'enough', 'video', 'video', 'appropriate', 'pre-schoolers', 'autism', 'grandchildren', 'love', 'songs', 'video', 'sing', 'children', 'video', 'calm', 'down', 'song', 'really', 'put', 'grandchildren', 'calmer', 'mode', 'lesson', 'planning', 'video', 'excellent', 'actually', 'enjoy', 'especially', 'songs', 'are', 'simple', 'appropriate', 'activity', 'children', 'are', 'engaging', 'lesson', 'planning', 'music', 'was', 'well', 'thought', 'out', 'video', 'highly', 'recommend', 'video', 'can', 'not', 'wait', 'next', 'volume', 'be', 'released']",Kibbles Rockin' Clubhouse vol. 1 Expressing Yourself

It is so well done and is perfect for any young child (wouldn't need to be on the spectrum).  We own about 30 educational dvd's and this is one of the very best... hope they make more soon.,5,Please make more!,1222732800,"09 30, 2008",2008,271,"['2', '1/2', 'year', 'old', 'daughter', 'was', 'love', 'DVD', 'moment', 'started', 'so', 'well', 'done', 'perfect', 'young', 'child', 'would', ""n't"", 'need', 'be', 'spectrum', 'own', '30', 'educational', 'dvd', 'one', 'very', 'best', 'hope', 'make', 'more', 'soon']",Kibbles Rockin' Clubhouse vol. 1 Expressing Yourself
