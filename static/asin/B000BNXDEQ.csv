This performance is now some 11 years old and finds the band touring in support of the as yet released ""The Bends"". Being a long time fan of the band myself I found this disc to be like a breath of fresh air- a reminder of why the band is so talented and so original. While later works have become experimental it is  easy to see here on this DVD that when they choose to offer staight forward rock, Radiohead is head and shoulders above those who have tried to follow (Coldplay). I highly recommend this release for any Radiohead fan.",5,Radiohead in fine format the Astoria,1135555200,"12 26, 2005",2005,643,"['Radiohead', 'live', 'Astoria', 'mindblowing', 'moment', 'time', 'caught', 'world-wide', 'fame', 'found', 'band', 'performance', 'now', '11', 'years', 'old', 'band', 'touring', 'support', 'yet', 'released', 'Bends', 'Being', 'long', 'time', 'fan', 'band', 'found', 'disc', 'be', 'breath', 'fresh', 'air-', 'reminder', 'why', 'band', 'so', 'talented', 'so', 'original', 'later', 'works', 'have', 'become', 'experimental', 'easy', 'see', 'here', 'DVD', 'when', 'choose', 'offer', 'staight', 'forward', 'rock', 'Radiohead', 'head', 'shoulders', 'who', 'have', 'tried', 'follow', 'Coldplay', 'highly', 'recommend', 'release', 'Radiohead', 'fan']",Radiohead: The Astoria London Live

I then picked up The Bends and realized what a bunch of talented guys they were. The live concert is Radiohead at their beginning before the rise to super stardom. The energy they deliver in each song represents a band that is really working hard to prove themselves. I doubt you would see that kind of intensity from them these days. I would like to point out an aspect of this concert that most people would ignore and that is the lighting. I'm not joking. When lighting is done right, it adds to the experience of a show. The quick cuts didn't bother me that much, in fact I think it added to the excitement of the performance but the lighting was actually done by people that knew the music and knew how to emphasize each mood change perfectly. The music is performed with almost flawless precision. Fake Plastic Trees and Blow Out were standouts for me. I would recommend this DVD not only to fans of Radiohead but to anyone who enjoys modern alternative music.

Not only is it a fantastic show, it is just before The Bends is released and it is just wild to see and hear these songs played prior to release when the crowd in attendance had never heard them.  I watched knowing that when the album was released Radiohead was going to come of age and anyone in that crowd was going to be blown away.  The crowd reactions are great and Thom is introducing songs from The Bends as NEW.  The energy is just incredible.  The guitar playing is phenomenal. The talent is unbelievable.Also, seeing this live gave new life to some of the songs off of Pablo Honey that had never caught me before, expecially Prove Yourself.I agree that they should have let the camera linger a little longer, especially on Johnny.  But still, this deserves 5 stars.I am also hoping that they are releasing this on DVD now so that we fans get it now and have plenty of cash saved for all of the great material (in various formats) that they are going to release in 2006!!!dmh",5,CREEP,1132704000,"11 23, 2005",2005,1011,"['surreal', 'watch', 'Not', 'only', 'fantastic', 'show', 'just', 'Bends', 'released', 'just', 'wild', 'see', 'hear', 'songs', 'played', 'prior', 'release', 'when', 'crowd', 'attendance', 'had', 'never', 'heard', 'watched', 'knowing', 'when', 'album', 'was', 'released', 'Radiohead', 'was', 'going', 'come', 'age', 'anyone', 'crowd', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'blown', 'away', 'crowd', 'reactions', 'are', 'great', 'Thom', 'introducing', 'songs', 'Bends', 'NEW', 'energy', 'just', 'incredible', 'guitar', 'playing', 'phenomenal', 'talent', 'unbelievable.Also', 'seeing', 'live', 'gave', 'new', 'life', 'songs', 'Pablo', 'Honey', 'had', 'never', 'caught', 'expecially', 'Prove', 'Yourself.I', 'agree', 'should', 'have', 'let', 'camera', 'little', 'longer', 'especially', 'Johnny', 'still', '5', 'stars.I', 'am', 'also', 'hoping', 'are', 'releasing', 'DVD', 'now', 'so', 'fans', 'get', 'now', 'have', 'plenty', 'cash', 'saved', 'great', 'material', 'various', 'formats', 'are', 'going', 'release', '2006', 'dmh']",Radiohead: The Astoria London Live

This includes Pablo Honey and The Bends material along with some other odds and ends. It is so mind blowing guitar driven it will give you chills and then Thom York's wonderful vocals will captivate you totally and completely. I honestly believe as they progressed after The Bends, their material became totally unlistenable. There's some amazing stuff post Bends but that is their Sgt. Pepper in my opinion. They definitely chilled out after The Bends. The one downfall of this DVD is that it's only in PCM stereo. That's really stupid but does sound great. I have no clue why they couldn't spring for 2.0 at a minimum but it's so damn awesome.",5,One of the best LIVE shows EVER!!!,1133568000,"12 3, 2005",2005,745,"['Now', 'know', 'will', 'be', 'rage', 'what', ""'ll"", 'say', 'when', 'RADIOHEAD', 'were', 'best', 'Pablo', 'Honey', 'Bends', 'material', 'other', 'odds', 'ends', 'so', 'mind', 'blowing', 'guitar', 'driven', 'will', 'give', 'chills', 'then', 'Thom', 'York', 'wonderful', 'vocals', 'will', 'captivate', 'totally', 'completely', 'honestly', 'believe', 'progressed', 'Bends', 'material', 'became', 'totally', 'unlistenable', 'amazing', 'stuff', 'post', 'Bends', 'Sgt', 'Pepper', 'opinion', 'definitely', 'chilled', 'out', 'Bends', 'one', 'downfall', 'DVD', 'only', 'PCM', 'stereo', 'really', 'stupid', 'sound', 'great', 'have', 'clue', 'why', 'could', ""n't"", 'spring', '2.0', 'minimum', 'so', 'damn', 'awesome']",Radiohead: The Astoria London Live
946025,AENRHAKDM5GMP,B000BNXDEQ,"J. Lockridge ""jllx""","[1, 2]","Radiohead is a victim of their own creativity. They continue thinking that they must ""push the envelope"" into Electronica, when they are, at heart, a guitar-based, melodic, rock and roll band. THIS is, alas, the only ""professional"" video we have of live play of their first two albums when they were ""just a simple guitar band"", and it's saddening to the point of depression. After all, anyone can take electronic loops and make crap like they and a million other ""bands"" and individuals are doing now, but only geniuses can take 4-6 guys and make their instruments really work together and sing together like Radiohead was doing in the 90's. I'm not a nostalgic guy, but I have to say this period up through ""OK, Computer"" were their best live era...everything since has gone downhill, regardless of what the ""critics"" say and what Thom Yorke thinks...They may have felt trapped, but tell me a song like ""High and Dry"", or ""Bones"", or ""Anyone can Play Guitar"", or ""Black Star"", or ""Fake Plastic Trees"" aren't better than anything else they've done since ""Computer"". You'd be lying to yourself if you said there was anything better than those. An ""art fart"", if you will...So, don't miss this concert/DVD. There is no better stamp of this band's energy and greatness. Their melodic lines were never better and they never performed better than this.I took off a star for the (lack of) production.

Your not gonna see any of the electronic infused tunes of the oh so great 'Kid A', your getting straight hard rock from Radiohead here instead. Personally I just adore 'Kid A' and really love 'Amnesiac' and 'Hail to the Thief', but this is a great early peek at 'Radiohead' and am very happy with my purchase.
