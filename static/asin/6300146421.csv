However it does have a few good things going for it. It's kind of like an Anthropophagous (1980), Friday the 13th Part 2 (1981), hybrid. We'll begin with the plot...Some friends are out on a boat & find a man stranded, they bring him aboard. He tells them, that nearby is an island, inhabited by an old recluse woman, and her dogs. One of our characters (Nick) goes nuts, threatens his fellow friends/family members (and saved man) with a gun; and sails the boat right over some jagged rocks. They come ashore on the island, and find a horrifying secret. They all begin to fall prey to HUMONGOUS!Good: The film has great atmosphere and foreboding mood. The acting ranges from bad to okay. The effects aren't stellar, but are passable. One minor nitpick I have, for a hulking cannibal, our antagonist sure doesn't seem to have much of an appetite, as we never see him eat anybody. That aside everything else is fine. I like the dark tones of the sky, which adds to the atmosphere. As we see the day in the beginning go from bright & sunny, to dark and haunting.Humongous is a fun flick, that should be waded into with low expectations.

196610,A29TKSIWA3JKF3,6300146421,Einsatz,"[1, 1]","I bought this DVD for purely sentimental reasons.  I first saw this movie back when I was working towards a degree in photography.  What impressed me most were the carefully composed scenes, especially once the characters got to the lodge on Dog Island.  I hadn't seen many slasher-type horror movies up to that time so I had nothing to compare this movie to; as a standard horror movie, it was okay.  As plots go, this is the usual clich&eacute; of stranding teens in a place where they are picked off one at a time (most of the slaughter is done off screen).  In this film, you have to count yourself lucky that you even get to see the results.  Most things are hinted at, teased through shadow and light, movement, sound.  In that regard, most of the heavy lifting is done by the music score, which is very effect, all things considered.  Yes, most of the action takes place at night.  The `villain' is never seen in his entirety.  The cast consists of two brothers, one a gun toting nut, the other a jock, a bespectacled nerd-girl for comic relief, a bad girl, and a model.  They add another body, I mean stranger, to their small number later in the movie.  Except for the opening salvo, a harrowing rape sequence, most of the action comes much later in the game.I like this movie not because it is especially well done, but because it struck a chord in me of unrelenting sadness, right up to the final image.To this day, I still don't get the title: Humongous.  Who would name their kid that?  As for being descriptive of anything in this movie, I can't say they focused on anything long enough to get its dimensions.I'm keeping it as being representative of a bygone era.

196613,AVJZQ6YNFUK92,6300146421,Grindhouse and Horror,"[4, 4]","A woman is raped in 1946 by an ex-boyfriend; the guy is then mauled to death by her pet guard dogs.  It then cuts to the 80s were a group of people go on a boat trip with a lunatic called Nick who seems to hate his brother.  They stop the boat at night, and he gets annoyed by the sounds of howling dogs at a nearby island.  He overtakes the boat and says stuff like ""you're not the only one who can do things"" and ""I've got as much right as you.""  He crashes the boat and they wash ashore on the island with the dogs.  The baby of the rapist is now a deformed super strong freak that's still on the island.Some people will love this film and others won't.  It depends on your taste, but I've seen it numerous times.  It also doesn't get into the background of what's going on with this Nick character.  If you're a huge fan of 80s horror you'll probably like it because the entire thing has an 80s type feel to it. The director (Paul Lynch) was the director of the original PROM NIGHT. Like that film, there isn't a lot of gore here. The goriest scene is the scene in the beginning when the guy is mauled by the dogs; this scene and the rape scene are the only parts that were cut for the R rating. The rest of the film has very little gore, but some of the violence does have some impact. The killer (a deformed freak with superhuman strength) doesn't use weapons like in other 80s slasher films; he uses his brute strength to kill. He was wandering the island and eating dogs for food, but now his food supply is almost gone. Apparently, he is now eating people. This film has some good atmosphere, and the island location provides nice scenery. It's well directed with a good amount of suspense, but you don't really care about the characters; you can tell that the film was trying to concentrate at times on character development, but I thought it definitely fails. There's some topless nudity, as well as a little full frontal during the rape scene in the beginning. Most of this movie is also very well scored. I thought the music during the opening and closing credits was pretty lousy and out of place for this type of film, but some of the other soundtracks are very well done and fit the film perfectly. Of particular mention is a scene towards the end when the freak is chasing a woman through the forest; the soundtrack was well done. The movie is slow at times and might bore some people, but I thought it is a great film that gets better with repeated viewings.The DVD is mastered from a VHS master. There is grain, but it's sharp with decent color and contrast. It doesn't look fantastic, but this is the best quality that I've seen it in. Considering they used a VHS master, it looks better than what many would expect. Overall, I thought the transfer was good. They might have used a full screen master and converted it to widescreen with anamorphic enhancement, so it may not be a real widescreen film; but the quality is still good, and I'm glad it's on DVD.",5,Definetly feels like it was made in the 80s.,1323129600,"12 6, 2011",2011,2978,"['woman', 'raped', '1946', 'ex-boyfriend', 'guy', 'then', 'mauled', 'death', 'pet', 'guard', 'dogs', 'then', '80s', 'were', 'group', 'people', 'go', 'boat', 'trip', 'lunatic', 'called', 'Nick', 'who', 'hate', 'brother', 'stop', 'boat', 'night', 'annoyed', 'sounds', 'howling', 'dogs', 'nearby', 'island', 'boat', 'stuff', ""'re"", 'not', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'can', 'do', 'things', ""'ve"", 'got', 'much', 'right', 'boat', 'wash', 'ashore', 'island', 'dogs', 'baby', 'rapist', 'now', 'deformed', 'super', 'strong', 'freak', 'still', 'island.Some', 'people', 'will', 'love', 'film', 'others', 'wo', ""n't"", 'taste', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'numerous', 'times', 'also', ""n't"", 'get', 'background', 'what', 'going', 'Nick', 'character', ""'re"", 'huge', 'fan', '80s', 'horror', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'entire', 'thing', '80s', 'type', 'feel', 'director', 'Paul', 'Lynch', 'was', 'director', 'original', 'PROM', 'NIGHT', 'film', ""n't"", 'lot', 'gore', 'here', 'goriest', 'scene', 'scene', 'beginning', 'when', 'guy', 'mauled', 'dogs', 'scene', 'rape', 'scene', 'are', 'only', 'parts', 'were', 'cut', 'R', 'rating', 'rest', 'film', 'very', 'little', 'gore', 'violence', 'have', 'impact', 'killer', 'deformed', 'freak', 'superhuman', 'strength', ""n't"", 'use', 'weapons', 'other', '80s', 'slasher', 'films', 'brute', 'strength', 'kill', 'was', 'wandering', 'island', 'eating', 'dogs', 'food', 'now', 'food', 'supply', 'almost', 'gone', 'Apparently', 'now', 'eating', 'people', 'film', 'good', 'atmosphere', 'island', 'location', 'nice', 'scenery', 'well', 'directed', 'good', 'amount', 'suspense', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'care', 'characters', 'can', 'tell', 'film', 'was', 'trying', 'concentrate', 'times', 'character', 'development', 'thought', 'definitely', 'topless', 'nudity', 'as', 'well', 'little', 'full', 'frontal', 'rape', 'scene', 'beginning', 'Most', 'movie', 'also', 'very', 'well', 'scored', 'thought', 'music', 'opening', 'closing', 'credits', 'was', 'pretty', 'lousy', 'place', 'type', 'film', 'other', 'soundtracks', 'are', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'fit', 'film', 'perfectly', 'particular', 'mention', 'scene', 'end', 'when', 'freak', 'chasing', 'woman', 'forest', 'soundtrack', 'was', 'well', 'done', 'movie', 'slow', 'times', 'might', 'bore', 'people', 'thought', 'great', 'film', 'better', 'repeated', 'viewings.The', 'DVD', 'mastered', 'VHS', 'master', 'grain', 'sharp', 'decent', 'color', 'contrast', ""n't"", 'look', 'fantastic', 'best', 'quality', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Considering', 'used', 'VHS', 'master', 'better', 'what', 'many', 'would', 'expect', 'Overall', 'thought', 'transfer', 'was', 'good', 'might', 'have', 'used', 'full', 'screen', 'master', 'converted', 'widescreen', 'anamorphic', 'enhancement', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'real', 'widescreen', 'film', 'quality', 'still', 'good', ""'m"", 'glad', 'DVD']",Humongous VHS
196614,A1EM1PEMH6OYDU,6300146421,"J. Cook ""Scabboy""","[10, 13]","[brief plot synopsis]In 1948 a teenage girl is raped by her boyfriend, and in revenge is killed for the act. Years later after she gave birth to his bastard retarded son, she secludes herself on a desolate island to raise him. After she died he is left to defend for himself, not knowing how to take care of himself he preys on the islands animals and his own guard dogs for food. Late one Summer evening, a group of teens out for a summer boating ride breaks down aside the island, looking for help they stumble onto his territory, and just in time-- he is hungry and hunts the teens like they were wild animals for food.[good things]First off, the movie's first kill was the bloodiest, a dog attack and pretty well done, in my opinion. I liked the setting. Of course, it being an 80's slasher flick it took a lot from movies like Friday The 13th. The movie was set in the middle of nowhere, it had a potentially menacing villain, beautiful heroine to be, a nice backstory, and a nice body count. I also liked the stalking nature of the killer, very similar to the P.O.V. shots in Friday The 13th. The movie was set over the course of a few days, and seemed to have nods to movies like Friday The 13th, Psycho and even Texas Chainsaw Massacre. The movie's killer was Garry Robbins, who played Saw Tooth on Wrong Turn.[the bad]The movie was old, and I had a DVDr sourced from VHS. The movie was too dark at times to see anything. The killer went unseen because of this, the lighting in the movie also sucked. Directing was lack lustre' and the movie in general was very anti-climatic. So much could have been done with the ending, and it completely fell limp. The movie I saw lacked blood, the kills seemed to be cut out all together. The teens would see the killer, and it would cut to another scene and later on they would be found mutilated. That was one of my biggest complaints with the movie.[final thoughts]In certain areas the movie was tense, it had a couple good scares, but all in all the movie was flat. The killer could have been so much meaner, and there could have been more blood. Some of the kills were pretty brutal, but let's thank the MPAA for the cuts. The movie seemed to have a lot taken from Friday The 13th Part 2. first off the concept for the killer; no father, retarded/deformed, killing people in mourning of his dead mother. Second, the killer had his dead mother displayed in his home for a memorial and third, in one scene one of the girls stumbles onto the memorial and acts like his mother to try and get away from him. There were a lot of other similarities, but these were the ones that seemed almost blatant to me.Finally, this movie is a good addition to any slasher collection, the movie stands neck to neck with slasher movies like Madman and The Final Terror, but lacks blood and it lacks the scares that movies like Friday The 13th, Texas Chainsaw Massacre and The Burning gave us.",2,Anti-climatic...,1136246400,"01 3, 2006",2006,2923,"['[', 'brief', 'plot', 'synopsis', ']', '1948', 'teenage', 'girl', 'raped', 'boyfriend', 'revenge', 'killed', 'act', 'Years', 'later', 'gave', 'birth', 'bastard', 'retarded', 'son', 'desolate', 'island', 'raise', 'died', 'left', 'defend', 'not', 'knowing', 'how', 'take', 'care', 'islands', 'animals', 'own', 'guard', 'dogs', 'food', 'Late', 'one', 'Summer', 'evening', 'group', 'teens', 'out', 'summer', 'boating', 'ride', 'breaks', 'down', 'aside', 'island', 'looking', 'help', 'stumble', 'territory', 'just', 'time', 'hungry', 'teens', 'were', 'wild', 'animals', 'food', '[', 'good', 'things', ']', 'First', 'off', 'movie', 'first', 'kill', 'was', 'bloodiest', 'dog', 'attack', 'pretty', 'well', 'done', 'opinion', 'liked', 'setting', 'course', 'being', '80', 'slasher', 'flick', 'took', 'lot', 'movies', 'Friday', '13th', 'movie', 'was', 'set', 'middle', 'nowhere', 'had', 'potentially', 'menacing', 'villain', 'beautiful', 'heroine', 'be', 'nice', 'backstory', 'nice', 'body', 'count', 'also', 'liked', 'stalking', 'nature', 'killer', 'very', 'similar', 'P.O.V', 'shots', 'Friday', '13th', 'movie', 'was', 'set', 'over', 'course', 'few', 'days', 'seemed', 'have', 'nods', 'movies', 'Friday', '13th', 'Psycho', 'even', 'Texas', 'Chainsaw', 'Massacre', 'movie', 'killer', 'was', 'Garry', 'Robbins', 'who', 'played', 'Saw', 'Tooth', 'Wrong', 'Turn', '[', 'bad', 'movie', 'was', 'old', 'had', 'DVDr', 'sourced', 'VHS', 'movie', 'was', 'too', 'dark', 'times', 'see', 'anything', 'killer', 'went', 'unseen', 'lighting', 'movie', 'also', 'sucked', 'Directing', 'was', 'lack', 'lustre', 'movie', 'general', 'was', 'very', 'anti-climatic', 'So', 'much', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'ending', 'completely', 'fell', 'limp', 'movie', 'saw', 'lacked', 'blood', 'kills', 'seemed', 'be', 'cut', 'out', 'together', 'teens', 'would', 'see', 'killer', 'would', 'cut', 'scene', 'later', 'would', 'be', 'found', 'mutilated', 'was', 'one', 'biggest', 'complaints', 'movie', '[', 'final', 'thoughts', ']', 'certain', 'areas', 'movie', 'was', 'tense', 'had', 'couple', 'good', 'scares', 'movie', 'was', 'flat', 'killer', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'much', 'meaner', 'there', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'blood', 'kills', 'were', 'pretty', 'brutal', 'let', 'thank', 'MPAA', 'cuts', 'movie', 'seemed', 'have', 'lot', 'taken', 'Friday', '13th', 'Part', '2.', 'first', 'concept', 'killer', 'father', 'retarded/deformed', 'killing', 'people', 'mourning', 'dead', 'mother', 'Second', 'killer', 'had', 'dead', 'mother', 'displayed', 'home', 'memorial', 'third', 'one', 'scene', 'one', 'girls', 'stumbles', 'memorial', 'acts', 'mother', 'try', 'get', 'away', 'were', 'lot', 'other', 'similarities', 'were', 'ones', 'seemed', 'almost', 'blatant', 'me.Finally', 'movie', 'good', 'addition', 'slasher', 'collection', 'movie', 'neck', 'neck', 'slasher', 'movies', 'Madman', 'Final', 'Terror', 'blood', 'scares', 'movies', 'Friday', '13th', 'Texas', 'Chainsaw', 'Massacre', 'Burning', 'gave']",Humongous VHS
