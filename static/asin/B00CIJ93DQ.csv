However, I was very disappointed in this Blu Ray disk because it did not come with surround sound.  I bought my first surround sound system and HD TV just to watch and listen to The Eagles - Hell Freezes Over DVD in DTS surround. Since then I have upgraded my system several times and own over 100 music/concert DVDs and Blu Rays and I play them every night. I was stunned to discover that this Blu Ray is stereo only. I spent 30 minutes trying to get to play in surround.  It did not say that on the Amazon site and does not say that on the package. Virtually every other music/concert DVD I have has the option of being played in one or more surround sound formats. I love the music, but would have just bought the CD if I had known this was only in stereo.

He's too fluid and tuned in to his audience to let a list keep him from connecting with his fans. As a life-long fan, I don't measure the quality of his performance by what he choose not to do, I think it's more sensible to comment on what he presented to the audience. This concert was an hour and forty-five minutes of what I consider some of my favorite Jackson Browne tunes. Truth is, he didn't have enough ""Top 40 hits"" to play for an hour and a half. But his best stuff has always been the songs you never heard on radio. And this concert is loaded with his best stuff!It's almost an acoustic performance, but he has enough solid backing here to do some of the things he hasn't done in a while, and do them well. If you're a true JB fan, you'll love it. If you're more of Top 40 person, try FM radio and get the same stale, dated tunes you apparently crave.I purchased the Blu-ray, and the sound and picture are both superb.

Huber ""Michael  Huber""","[3, 4]","I've followed JB since his first LP ""Saturate Before Using"" and have seen him in concert 4 times, absolutely phenomenal live. This BD is no exception on concert performance, probably better now than ever, not to take any thing away from his old band mates. The picture quality is excellent too, crisp, clear, and focused from my OPPO BDP-105. Every thing about this BD is perfect and right on the money, EXCEPT the audio, it is stereo 2.0 only! The sound quality of the 2.0 is very clean and detailed but lacks the .1 for the sub. This is most notable when he plays the piano and is a little thin on the bottom, as well as the rest of the bass.  A concert Blu-ray with 2.0 sound ONLY is like having a Ferrari that is governed at 55 mph, lots of show but no go! It seems to me that JB is not a big fan of making concert recordings as this is the only official all concert recording he has out. His ""Going Home"" DVD is just short concert clips and has no complete song on the whole disc! What's that! This would be a truly amazing recording but falls short of providing that concert experience at home. I understand the whole purest stereo concept, but also the surround benefits, especially on concert recordings. It's a shame that who ever made this decision made it with no or little regard for those who like surround sound, and to not even give an option? Must be a soundbar owner or have a poor audio system. I will say again that the audio that IS there is very clean and detailed so it's better than a lot of crappie 5.1 DD concerts out there. It's worth owning and is a great concert regardless. Read my comment to a reply.I wish Amazon had a 3 Criteria rating system, that would make for a quicker and more accurate rating of Cd's DVD's and Blu-ray's.1. Performance: *****2. Quality of Audio: ***** (subtract 1 for audio options): ****3. Quality of Video (for DVD's and Blu-ray's): *****Bands that wish to have there performances recognized and recorded should be held to a standard. Poor audio, no matter how good the performance, is still a bad product. Those who would still purchase sub-standard audio quality recordings and rank that product highly are not doing the industry, the band or others justice.

1647447,A1QVFHPY8418HC,B00CIJ93DQ,monkuboy,"[5, 5]","I've been a fan of Jackson Browne's from the time of his first album. For a frame of reference, Late For the Sky is my favorite album of his with The Pretender as the runner up.Regarding song selection, some reviews were critical because it was not a ""greatest hits"" collection. Well, I think the song selection is just fine; with so many excellent works, there will always be disagreement as to which songs should have made it to the disc. So it doesn't have ""Somebody's Baby.""  Well, too bad, eh?  I am happy that there is Blu Ray concert available for Mr. Browne and that it's a solid performance.Video-wise, the picture is fine. I buy concert Blu Rays more for the audio and not the video so I'll just say that I didn't detect anything that doesn't look right.  It's tastefully done and the picture quality is good.Audio-wise, the sound is excellent. It is recorded in Dolby TrueHD 2.0 96K.  Some have lamented the fact that there is no surround soundtrack, only two channel and while I would have liked to have had the option of surround, I didn't really miss it since the stereo track is so good. Instruments are well-placed and defined in the mix and everything is clear. I found I had to turn up the volume higher than normal but perhaps that is because it is 2 versus 5 channels.Performance-wise, Mr. Browne is very much at ease with the audience and looks totally comfortable during the show. So does his backup band. His age shows more in his face than his voice. He's still able to hit the higher notes like he did on the originals and doesn't have to sing alternate ones instead, and his voice is still unmistakably that of Jackson Browne.  If you are a fan of his, then I highly recommend this disc.",5,well worth it - buy it!,1372896000,"07 4, 2013",2013,1713,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'fan', 'Jackson', 'Browne', 'time', 'first', 'album', 'frame', 'reference', 'Late', 'Sky', 'favorite', 'album', 'Pretender', 'runner', 'up.Regarding', 'song', 'selection', 'reviews', 'were', 'critical', 'was', 'not', 'greatest', 'hits', 'collection', 'Well', 'think', 'song', 'selection', 'just', 'fine', 'so', 'many', 'excellent', 'works', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'disagreement', 'songs', 'should', 'have', 'made', 'disc', ""n't"", 'have', 'Somebody', 'Baby', 'Well', 'too', 'bad', 'eh', 'am', 'happy', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'concert', 'available', 'Mr.', 'Browne', 'solid', 'performance.Video-wise', 'picture', 'fine', 'buy', 'concert', 'Blu', 'Rays', 'more', 'audio', 'not', 'video', 'so', ""'ll"", 'just', 'say', 'did', ""n't"", 'detect', 'anything', ""n't"", 'look', 'right', 'tastefully', 'done', 'picture', 'quality', 'good.Audio-wise', 'sound', 'excellent', 'recorded', 'Dolby', 'TrueHD', '2.0', '96K', 'have', 'lamented', 'fact', 'surround', 'soundtrack', 'only', 'two', 'channel', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'have', 'had', 'option', 'surround', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'miss', 'stereo', 'track', 'so', 'good', 'Instruments', 'are', 'well-placed', 'defined', 'mix', 'everything', 'clear', 'found', 'had', 'turn', 'up', 'volume', 'higher', 'normal', 'perhaps', '2', 'versus', '5', 'channels.Performance-wise', 'Mr.', 'Browne', 'very', 'much', 'ease', 'audience', 'totally', 'comfortable', 'show', 'So', 'backup', 'band', 'age', 'more', 'face', 'voice', 'still', 'able', 'hit', 'higher', 'notes', 'did', 'originals', ""n't"", 'have', 'sing', 'alternate', 'ones', 'instead', 'voice', 'still', 'unmistakably', 'Jackson', 'Browne', 'are', 'fan', 'then', 'highly', 'recommend', 'disc']",I'll Do Anything: Live In Concert

Angel ""newangel9""","[4, 4]","This review is for the Blu Ray format which also plays on Region B players.The negative reviews are interesting and fall into two areas being NOT ENOUGH HITS and NO SURROUND SOUND.Well I was curious to see what songs he performed at this concert actually made it onto his  double best of album `The Very Best Of Jackson Browne'  released in 2004. Of the sixteen original songs performed on this Blu Ray nine songs were on the previously mentioned  `Best of' so I consider that a very generous selection from someone who really only gets `Running on Empty' and `Somebody's Baby' played on the radio these days.Jackson is still writing ,recording and performing wonderful music as this concert shows,it's just that radio doesn't play it and hasn't done since the 1980's so how can it become popular if nobody but the real fans who buy his stuff ever get to hear it.What you get here is a fine selection of songs covering his entire career.It starts off quite low key so be patient as it builds in intensity especially when Sara and Sean Watkins join him about five songs in.As for the lack of 5.1 surround I was surprised that a new release blu ray would only be in stereo.But right from the start I honestly did not miss the extra channels.The vocals were right in the centre in the mix and the clarity of each instrument is excellent.A nice deep ,warm bass coming through the subwoofer.Do not put off buying this blu ray for this reason.The clarity of the image is also very good for a concert with quite a lot of blue lighting on stage.What's not to like here.A great artist still at the top of his game.Also check out the documentary `Going Home'.",5,It's all good,1372723200,"07 2, 2013",2013,1649,"['review', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'format', 'also', 'Region', 'B', 'players.The', 'negative', 'reviews', 'are', 'interesting', 'fall', 'two', 'areas', 'being', 'NOT', 'ENOUGH', 'HITS', 'NO', 'SURROUND', 'SOUND.Well', 'was', 'curious', 'see', 'what', 'performed', 'concert', 'actually', 'made', 'double', 'best', 'album', 'Very', 'Best', 'Jackson', 'Browne', 'released', '2004', 'sixteen', 'original', 'songs', 'performed', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'nine', 'songs', 'were', 'previously', 'mentioned', 'Best', 'consider', 'very', 'generous', 'selection', 'someone', 'who', 'really', 'only', 'Running', 'Empty', 'Somebody', 'Baby', 'played', 'radio', 'days.Jackson', 'still', 'writing', 'recording', 'performing', 'wonderful', 'music', 'concert', 'just', 'radio', ""n't"", 'play', ""n't"", 'done', '1980', 'how', 'can', 'become', 'popular', 'nobody', 'real', 'fans', 'who', 'buy', 'stuff', 'ever', 'get', 'hear', 'get', 'here', 'fine', 'selection', 'songs', 'covering', 'entire', 'career.It', 'quite', 'low', 'key', 'so', 'be', 'patient', 'intensity', 'especially', 'when', 'Sara', 'Sean', 'Watkins', 'join', 'about', 'five', 'songs', 'in.As', 'lack', '5.1', 'surround', 'was', 'surprised', 'new', 'release', 'blu', 'ray', 'would', 'only', 'be', 'stereo.But', 'right', 'start', 'honestly', 'did', 'not', 'miss', 'extra', 'channels.The', 'vocals', 'were', 'right', 'centre', 'mix', 'clarity', 'instrument', 'excellent.A', 'nice', 'deep', 'warm', 'bass', 'coming', 'subwoofer.Do', 'not', 'put', 'off', 'buying', 'blu', 'ray', 'reason.The', 'clarity', 'image', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'concert', 'lot', 'blue', 'lighting', 'stage.What', 'not', 'like', 'here.A', 'great', 'artist', 'still', 'top', 'game.Also', 'check', 'documentary', 'Going', 'Home']",I'll Do Anything: Live In Concert

1647453,A10PC6OX6CEHZV,B00CIJ93DQ,Steve W.,"[13, 13]","I hate to sound like everyone else when I say I've seen Jackson Browne in concert many times over the past 35 plus years.  I was lucky to catch on at the time his second record (For Everyman) was current, and so for many years have enjoyed his talent.  Late For The Sky is surely one of the most important records of the historic era of stereo records/rock and roll/FM radio.  By purchasing and listening to his records, I can confirm that there are many great songs in his catalog.  But saying so, I'm no more qualified to rate this dvd concert than any other fan.I ordered it a couple days ago, it arrived yesterday, I watched it last night.  I last saw him in concert a couple years ago when he was touring solo/acoustic/small venues.  This concert is more recent, with a complimenting group of younger musicians backing him up.  Like many older fans probably feel, there's no substitute for David Lindley in my opinion for the violin/pedal steel flavor of the early Jackson Browne records.  In this dvd, these younger back-up players allow the older songs to be re-visited with a familiar, yet fresh, presentation.  There's a violin player, an electric guitar soloist, and a acoustic guitarist that each provide a partial tribute to David Lindley's original contributions.  They're not the same, but it works pretty well.As a particular example, ""A Child In These Hills"" is a song from the 1972 debut Jackson Browne album.  If you are truly a fan, then you know the record, and you know this cut is not one of his radio hits.  This dvd concert includes this song, with a slightly different rhythm and presentation as compared to the album version.  It's a highlight of the dvd.  It's great, and if it had sounded like this 40 years ago, it would have rivaled Doctor My Eyes or Rock Me On The Water as a radio hit.  I had the same sensation with the dvd version of ""Naked Ride Home"".  While only slightly different in rhythm, I much prefer it to the original album version.Jackson Browne is known for, and greatly admired by many for, his melancholy lyrics.  This dvd concert represents that characteristic of his catalog.  But there's upbeat feeling as well.  ""Running On Empty"" is well done here.  Really, it's all very well done.  I can't see anyone complaining about the selection of songs included in this particular evening concert.  This man is a music talent phenomenon.  This dvd entertainment is well worth the dollar expense.  His earlier dvd title, ""Going Home"" is also very good.  I've never been disappointed in any investment of time or expense in Jackson Browne.  If he happens to ever read this review, I'd like to say how sincerely grateful I am to him for the contribution he made to my happiness and understanding in life.",5,it's great.....,1372204800,"06 26, 2013",2013,2745,"['hate', 'sound', 'everyone', 'else', 'when', 'say', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Jackson', 'Browne', 'concert', 'many', 'times', 'past', '35', 'years', 'was', 'lucky', 'catch', 'time', 'second', 'record', 'Everyman', 'was', 'current', 'so', 'many', 'years', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'talent', 'Late', 'Sky', 'surely', 'one', 'most', 'important', 'records', 'historic', 'era', 'stereo', 'records/rock', 'roll/FM', 'radio', 'purchasing', 'listening', 'records', 'can', 'confirm', 'are', 'many', 'great', 'songs', 'catalog', 'saying', 'so', ""'m"", 'more', 'qualified', 'rate', 'dvd', 'concert', 'other', 'fan.I', 'ordered', 'couple', 'days', 'ago', 'arrived', 'yesterday', 'watched', 'last', 'night', 'last', 'saw', 'concert', 'couple', 'years', 'ago', 'when', 'was', 'touring', 'solo/acoustic/small', 'venues', 'concert', 'more', 'recent', 'complimenting', 'group', 'younger', 'musicians', 'backing', 'up', 'many', 'older', 'fans', 'probably', 'feel', 'substitute', 'David', 'Lindley', 'opinion', 'violin/pedal', 'steel', 'flavor', 'early', 'Jackson', 'Browne', 'records', 'dvd', 'younger', 'back-up', 'players', 'allow', 'older', 'songs', 'be', 're-visited', 'familiar', 'yet', 'fresh', 'presentation', 'violin', 'player', 'electric', 'guitar', 'soloist', 'acoustic', 'guitarist', 'provide', 'partial', 'tribute', 'David', 'Lindley', 'original', 'contributions', ""'re"", 'not', 'same', 'pretty', 'well.As', 'particular', 'example', 'Child', 'Hills', 'song', '1972', 'debut', 'Jackson', 'Browne', 'album', 'are', 'truly', 'fan', 'then', 'know', 'record', 'know', 'cut', 'not', 'one', 'radio', 'hits', 'dvd', 'concert', 'song', 'slightly', 'different', 'rhythm', 'presentation', 'compared', 'album', 'version', 'highlight', 'dvd', 'great', 'had', 'sounded', '40', 'years', 'ago', 'would', 'have', 'rivaled', 'Doctor', 'My', 'Eyes', 'Rock', 'Me', 'Water', 'radio', 'hit', 'had', 'same', 'sensation', 'dvd', 'version', 'Naked', 'Ride', 'Home', 'only', 'slightly', 'different', 'rhythm', 'much', 'prefer', 'original', 'album', 'version.Jackson', 'Browne', 'known', 'greatly', 'admired', 'many', 'melancholy', 'lyrics', 'dvd', 'concert', 'characteristic', 'catalog', 'upbeat', 'feeling', 'as', 'well', 'Running', 'Empty', 'well', 'done', 'here', 'Really', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'anyone', 'complaining', 'selection', 'songs', 'included', 'particular', 'evening', 'concert', 'man', 'music', 'talent', 'phenomenon', 'dvd', 'entertainment', 'well', 'worth', 'dollar', 'expense', 'earlier', 'dvd', 'title', 'Going', 'Home', 'also', 'very', 'good', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'disappointed', 'investment', 'time', 'expense', 'Jackson', 'Browne', 'ever', 'read', 'review', ""'d"", 'like', 'say', 'how', 'sincerely', 'grateful', 'am', 'contribution', 'made', 'happiness', 'understanding', 'life']",I'll Do Anything: Live In Concert

Don't waste your money, unless you like hearing the same melody, sung mournfully and slow.  Even his best song ""I'll Do Anything"" was super, slooooooow and sounded like all the rest. Sorry I bought this as I am a fan of Jackson Browne.
