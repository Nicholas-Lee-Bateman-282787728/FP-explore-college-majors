One of the few I have enjoyed with Nicholas Cage apart from Moonstruck. A couple of teen romances with The Sure Thing a stand out due to it's leads and Rob Reiners direction.

1072319,A9UH6I9GVQZU2,B000PMFS00,"Low-Ranking Reviewer ""tell it like it is""","[18, 18]","I bought this awhile back when a certain retail store(let's call them 'ircuit ity') had this double feature on a special sale for $6!  I bought it mainly for The Sure Thing, but Valley Girl isn't bad either.  For me to go into the plotlines, ""opposites attract"" themes, or point out the 80's vibe of both films would be insulting to those reading this.  Besides, the reviews for the individual films are plentiful and more helpful than what i could possibly write.I'll just comment on the dvd itself.  Each film is on a separate 2-sided disc.  Widescreen versions for both, though fullscreen options are available(side two of Valley Girl for sure, can't remember if fullscreen is included for The Sure Thing as i'm a widescreen-person all the way).  Each film has a commentary track by its director(Reiner and Coolidge respectively) and an in-movie text commentary of sorts by way of pop-ups as bonus features.  This is the 'trivia track' extra listed on the back(honestly, i thought this would be a trivia game about the 80's or about the movies).  Also, it doesn't list it on the back of the box, but The Sure Thing has a fairly extensive making of featurettes on side two(including participation by most of the main talent in the original film).  Not sure why this is not emphasized on the back as an extra as well, as it would've been a selling point to me along time ago.  I'm just glad it was included, a nice bonus surprise nonetheless.  Also, there's a few mini-extras all featuring the Sure Thing herself.",4,Pretty good deal,1189036800,"09 6, 2007",2007,1514,"['bought', 'awhile', 'back', 'when', 'certain', 'retail', 'store', 'let', 'call', 'ity', 'had', 'double', 'feature', 'special', 'sale', '6', 'bought', 'mainly', 'Sure', 'Thing', 'Valley', 'Girl', ""n't"", 'bad', 'either', 'go', 'plotlines', 'attract', 'themes', 'point', 'out', '80', 'vibe', 'films', 'would', 'be', 'insulting', 'reading', 'Besides', 'reviews', 'individual', 'films', 'are', 'plentiful', 'more', 'helpful', 'what', 'i', 'could', 'possibly', 'write.I', ""'ll"", 'just', 'comment', 'dvd', 'film', 'separate', '2-sided', 'disc', 'Widescreen', 'versions', 'fullscreen', 'options', 'are', 'available', 'side', 'two', 'Valley', 'Girl', 'sure', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'fullscreen', 'included', 'Sure', 'Thing', 'i', ""'m"", 'widescreen-person', 'way', 'film', 'commentary', 'track', 'director', 'Reiner', 'Coolidge', 'respectively', 'in-movie', 'text', 'commentary', 'sorts', 'way', 'pop-ups', 'bonus', 'features', ""'trivia"", 'track', 'extra', 'listed', 'back', 'honestly', 'i', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'trivia', 'game', '80', 'movies', 'Also', ""n't"", 'list', 'back', 'box', 'Sure', 'Thing', 'fairly', 'extensive', 'making', 'featurettes', 'side', 'two', 'including', 'participation', 'most', 'main', 'talent', 'original', 'film', 'Not', 'sure', 'why', 'not', 'emphasized', 'back', 'extra', 'as', 'well', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'selling', 'point', 'time', ""'m"", 'just', 'glad', 'was', 'included', 'nice', 'bonus', 'surprise', 'nonetheless', 'Also', 'few', 'mini-extras', 'featuring', 'Sure', 'Thing']",Totally Awesome 80s: (The Sure Thing / Valley Girl)
