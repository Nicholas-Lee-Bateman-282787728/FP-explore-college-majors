1281123,AO1Z0TQWCRGL4,B002OLV3SG,"Harold Wolf ""Doc""","[30, 30]","I'm no doctor or cardiologist, but I have had 2 heart attacks.  This Sansone Walk Away the Pounds for Your Week DVD is just what the doctor told me to do for my health.  And the walking and exercises are the same as what the leaders in the cardio-rehab were having me do for recovery, rehabilitation, and finding my limits after my last episode.  So this is a perfect DVD for my continued walking need, strength training, and a way to keep up the workouts when the weather will not allow outside walking.I can't afford expensive workout equipment but this DVD takes it's place at a very affordable price.  Better yet, my wife has been doing Sansone walking to tapes and DVDs for years, so now we do it together.  We encourage each other.  We're both over 60, so it is a program for almost any age, we're proving that.Always consult your doctor, but I'd guess almost all heart patients could use Leslie Sansone DVDs for their needed healthy exercise to go along with the healthy diet.It's great to be alive--willing--and able.",5,Workout's most heart patients can do,1261872000,"12 27, 2009",2009,1025,"[""'m"", 'doctor', 'cardiologist', 'have', 'had', '2', 'heart', 'attacks', 'Sansone', 'Walk', 'Away', 'Pounds', 'Week', 'DVD', 'just', 'what', 'doctor', 'told', 'do', 'health', 'walking', 'exercises', 'are', 'same', 'what', 'leaders', 'cardio-rehab', 'were', 'having', 'do', 'recovery', 'rehabilitation', 'finding', 'limits', 'last', 'episode', 'perfect', 'DVD', 'continued', 'walking', 'need', 'strength', 'training', 'way', 'keep', 'up', 'workouts', 'when', 'weather', 'will', 'not', 'allow', 'walking.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'afford', 'expensive', 'workout', 'equipment', 'DVD', 'place', 'very', 'affordable', 'price', 'Better', 'yet', 'wife', 'been', 'doing', 'Sansone', 'walking', 'tapes', 'DVDs', 'years', 'so', 'now', 'do', 'together', 'encourage', 'other', ""'re"", '60', 'program', 'almost', 'age', ""'re"", 'proving', 'that.Always', 'consult', 'doctor', ""'d"", 'guess', 'almost', 'heart', 'patients', 'could', 'use', 'Leslie', 'Sansone', 'DVDs', 'needed', 'healthy', 'exercise', 'go', 'along', 'healthy', 'diet.It', 'great', 'be', 'alive', 'willing', 'able']",N/A

Muscle Mile One and Walk Diet One Mile are perfect when you're short on time. The 30 Minute Walk is brisk. The Pilates workout is a good, basic introduction. Leslie's instructions are easy to follow, and the pace is slow enough for a beginner. My DVD has the Walk Strong Express on it, so the DVD producer corrected their earlier labeling error.

The little twinkle lights in the background and horrible painted pillars.  It truly put me to sleep.  It wasn't exciting at all.  I didn't want to do any of it and I feel ripped off that these were from prior releases (those of which I guess I don't own)  I own 5 other DVD's and none of these miles were in any of them.  Just going off what a user posted before me.Don't buy this DVD if it's your first one (or at any other time).  Buy her 3 mile to start or the 5 mile.  My favorite is her 2 very fast miles.You won't be sorry you purchased any of her other DVD's.",1,Horrible Leslie Sansone DVD :(,1266883200,"02 23, 2010",2010,792,"['am', 'HUGE', 'fan', 'videos', 'one.If', 'had', 'been', 'first', 'DVD', 'Leslie', 'Sansone', 'Walk', 'Home', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'distractions', 'was', 'very', 'calm', 'not', 'motivating', 'DVD', 'little', 'twinkle', 'lights', 'background', 'horrible', 'painted', 'pillars', 'truly', 'put', 'sleep', 'was', ""n't"", 'exciting', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'do', 'feel', 'ripped', 'off', 'were', 'prior', 'releases', 'guess', 'do', ""n't"", 'own', 'own', '5', 'other', 'DVD', 'none', 'miles', 'were', 'Just', 'going', 'off', 'what', 'user', 'posted', 'me.Do', ""n't"", 'buy', 'DVD', 'first', 'one', 'other', 'time', 'Buy', '3', 'mile', 'start', '5', 'mile', 'favorite', '2', 'very', 'fast', 'miles.You', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'sorry', 'purchased', 'other', 'DVD']",N/A
