He gets this expression on his face when he's excited and it's like everything else in the world melts away. This is how he looked while watching Madeline. It was a whole new experience. He loves to read too, so now I'm going to have to get him the books.",5,Bridget's Review,1271116800,"04 13, 2010",2010,294,"['nephew', 'loved', 'movie', 'expression', 'face', 'when', 'excited', 'everything', 'else', 'world', 'away', 'how', 'looked', 'watching', 'Madeline', 'was', 'whole', 'new', 'experience', 'read', 'too', 'so', 'now', ""'m"", 'going', 'have', 'get', 'books']",Madeline: Lost in Paris VHS
502156,AXPQ8N6JVUWBD,B00000IBKK,Emily Baudelaire,"[7, 7]","As a young child, I used to love Madeline. The kindergarten teachers would read us the books at story-time, and I'd watch the cartoon at home. But this movie isn't so happy-go-lucky, in fact, I really don't think parents should let their children 6 and under watch it. It has a very dark theme. It's about how Madeline gets kidnapped, and is forced to work as a slave without pay. They work in a basement with no light, often the children go blind or get sick. You also see little children running about the city by themselves, and you see threats, inappropriate language, you even see someone's pants rip open! I was absolutely shocked when I saw this as a ten-year-old, and I kept thinking to myself, is THIS the type of film parents want to watch with their children? On the plus side, the music is very delightful, and the soundtrack is wonderful to own. But believe me, if you want to introduce a child to orphans and child labour, I suggest you have them see such films as ""A Little Princess"", ""The Secret Garden"", and Disney's ""Annie"". Or if you're a Madeline fan who needs something more childlike and friendly, check out the live-action Madeline movie starring Hatty Jones-that one's worth it.",3,Not your typical family film,1029283200,"08 14, 2002",2002,1202,"['young', 'child', 'used', 'love', 'Madeline', 'kindergarten', 'teachers', 'would', 'read', 'books', 'story-time', ""'d"", 'watch', 'cartoon', 'home', 'movie', ""n't"", 'so', 'happy-go-lucky', 'fact', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'parents', 'should', 'let', 'children', '6', 'watch', 'very', 'dark', 'theme', 'how', 'Madeline', 'kidnapped', 'forced', 'work', 'slave', 'pay', 'work', 'basement', 'light', 'often', 'children', 'go', 'blind', 'get', 'sick', 'also', 'see', 'little', 'children', 'running', 'city', 'see', 'threats', 'inappropriate', 'language', 'even', 'see', 'someone', 'pants', 'rip', 'open', 'was', 'absolutely', 'shocked', 'when', 'saw', 'ten-year-old', 'kept', 'thinking', 'myself', 'THIS', 'type', 'film', 'parents', 'want', 'watch', 'children', 'plus', 'side', 'music', 'very', 'delightful', 'soundtrack', 'wonderful', 'own', 'believe', 'want', 'introduce', 'child', 'orphans', 'child', 'labour', 'suggest', 'have', 'see', 'such', 'films', 'A', 'Little', 'Princess', 'Secret', 'Garden', 'Disney', 'Annie', ""'re"", 'Madeline', 'fan', 'who', 'something', 'more', 'childlike', 'friendly', 'check', 'out', 'live-action', 'Madeline', 'movie', 'starring', 'Hatty', 'Jones-that', 'one', 'worth']",Madeline: Lost in Paris VHS
502157,A3LC2I812OWCKB,B00000IBKK,"""gotstuff""","[6, 7]","My daughter received this video for her sixth birthday, and she LOVES it!!!  The animation is great, the songs and catchy (with lots of music video style animation to go with them!) the plot is engaging enough to hold her interest, and the message throughout is wonderful:  There's nothing better than true friendship!  As a parent, I find the movie entertaining, myself, as we feel ourselves &quot;pulling&quot; for our heroine Madeline, who is adorable and has a heart of gold, as usual!  In the story, Madeline is &quot;tricked&quot; by a man pretending to be her uncle, but who in fact wants her to go to work for her in a lace factory that's run by a very evil woman (in the style of Cruella DaVille)!  Kids my daughter's age seem to really get into this theme of the evil villan or villaneous trying to capture the &quot;good guy&quot; - and then the &quot;good guy&quot; getting away.  Maybe this movie wouldn't be appropriate for a three year old (I don't think it was made for three year olds!) but for girls age 5 and up, it's a SUREFIRE WINNER.

Notice, that most of the bad reviews are written by parents with biological children, and not by parents with adopted children. Just so you know, I was seven when I watched this movie and was not scared by it, because of that I feel like an alien. I am 16 now and can notice the movie's theme, and why the reviews are bad.
