Every life has many connections and this explores the relationships between old friends, fathers and sons, fathers and daughters, mothers and daughters, brothers, and those who have no one at all.

Gary Sinise was outstanding.  The film is about a very successful attorney in L.A., named Terry who 30 years ago, after graduation, left his home of Maine because of a falling out with his cold-hearted dad.  He returns home after he gets a phone call saying his dad is very ill and in the hospital.  When he returns home, he learns his dad has died.  He returns to the house where he grew up, only planning to stay long enough to clean and settle the cottage estate.  There, he is reunited with a childhood acquaintance, Katherine (played by Joley Richardson) a woman with whom, as a child, he was in a car accident together that killed a mother and child.  The driver of the fatal accident was her dad who, grief-stricken from the accident, walks away from the accident, never to be seen again and is presumed dead.  Fast forward 30 years to the present and we find the young girl now a grown woman planning to spend Christmas at the cottage with her adopted daughter, Olivia (Jordy Benattar).  Katherine has no conscious recollection of Terry.  He ends up staying longer than expected and his life is changed forever as he falls in love with her and begins the task of putting the pieces together surrounding the truth of the accident and her dad's disappearance.  Now he finds himself struggling with how and when to reveal the truth about her dad and his (Terry's) connection to her who was also involved in the accident.

Those claims absolutely cannot be made about ""Fallen Angel"".The movie opens with a defining sequence about the relationship between our main character and his father, and includes a traumatic incident which impacts the later story.The meat of the movie has Gary Sinise returning to his home town to wrap up loose ends upon the death of his father. Only one part of the story from that point on is in any way predictable.

As the movie opens you see a young boy, Terry McQuinn, eager for his father's attention and approval. But his father is so focused on his work as a caretaker for the vacation homes of the wealthy that he has little time to realize how much his motherless son needs care-taking. One of the families for whom he works is coming to their vacation home, Serenity Cottage, for the Christmas holiday and Terry's father has reluctantly allowed him to come along as he prepares the home for their arrival. The Wentworth family shows up while Terry and his father are still at the home--a happy little girl named Katherine, her adoring father, and her seemingly cynical, unhappy mother. The father has a tradition of taking gifts to children in a hospital at Christmas and he invites Terry to go along with him and his daughter to the nearby hospital. It is a very snowy evening and there is an accident which takes a life. Mr. Wentworth blames himself and wanders off, never returning home. Mrs. Wentworth takes her daughter, gets a divorce, and never returns to the vacation home.As time passes and Terry has grown to be a teenager, the tension between his father and himself has also grown. The final straw is when Mr. McQuinn fails to come to his son's graduation because he is doing some work for one of the wealthy families. He and Terry have bitter words between them and Terry takes off.Flash forward many years. Terry is a successful attorney in L.A. His father, from whom he is still estranged, dies and Terry returns home to settle his affairs. While there he sees a note his father had made about the current owner wanting Serenity Cottage opened for the holidays. He calls and explains that his father has died, he is just there to tie up the loose ends and will be leaving soon so he can't help them, but will find someone who can. After he learns that the owner is the daughter of the former owner, the little girl that he had known, he stays on and is there to meet Katherine and her very unique daughter. She has forgotten that one visit she made as a child and has no memory of ever having known Terry. He does not tell her otherwise.  The story takes some interesting turns from there.Throughout the movie it deals with some serious issues--dysfunctional families, grief, homelessness, adoption, disabilities, and deception. Of course, there is romance in the air--and also intrigue, as you learn the fate of Katharine's father. The storyline holds your interest and the characters are not one dimensional. The acting is good and the movie is well worth the viewing. I highly recommend it, but if you have young children it might be a little deep for them.At the time of this writing the price of this movie through the marketplace sellers started around $35. If that doesn't drop you should be able to get it at a Hallmark store for around $20 or from their website for an additional $7 in shipping.",5,Excellent holiday drama,1283212800,"08 31, 2010",2010,3023,"['movie', 'reach', 'when', 'want', 'heart-warming', 'holiday', 'theme', 'more', 'meat', 'fluff', 'movie', 'see', 'young', 'boy', 'Terry', 'McQuinn', 'eager', 'father', 'attention', 'approval', 'father', 'so', 'focused', 'work', 'caretaker', 'vacation', 'homes', 'wealthy', 'little', 'time', 'realize', 'how', 'much', 'motherless', 'son', 'care-taking', 'One', 'families', 'whom', 'coming', 'vacation', 'home', 'Serenity', 'Cottage', 'Christmas', 'holiday', 'Terry', 'father', 'reluctantly', 'allowed', 'come', 'along', 'home', 'arrival', 'Wentworth', 'family', 'up', 'Terry', 'father', 'are', 'still', 'home', 'happy', 'little', 'girl', 'named', 'Katherine', 'adoring', 'father', 'seemingly', 'cynical', 'unhappy', 'mother', 'father', 'tradition', 'taking', 'gifts', 'children', 'hospital', 'Christmas', 'Terry', 'go', 'along', 'daughter', 'nearby', 'hospital', 'very', 'snowy', 'evening', 'accident', 'life', 'Mr.', 'Wentworth', 'wanders', 'off', 'never', 'returning', 'home', 'Mrs.', 'Wentworth', 'daughter', 'divorce', 'never', 'returns', 'vacation', 'home.As', 'time', 'passes', 'Terry', 'grown', 'be', 'teenager', 'tension', 'father', 'also', 'grown', 'final', 'straw', 'when', 'Mr.', 'McQuinn', 'come', 'son', 'graduation', 'doing', 'work', 'one', 'wealthy', 'families', 'Terry', 'have', 'bitter', 'words', 'Terry', 'off.Flash', 'forward', 'many', 'years', 'Terry', 'successful', 'attorney', 'L.A.', 'father', 'whom', 'still', 'estranged', 'dies', 'Terry', 'home', 'settle', 'affairs', 'note', 'father', 'had', 'made', 'current', 'owner', 'wanting', 'Serenity', 'Cottage', 'opened', 'holidays', 'father', 'died', 'just', 'there', 'tie', 'up', 'loose', 'ends', 'will', 'be', 'leaving', 'soon', 'so', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'will', 'find', 'someone', 'who', 'can', 'owner', 'daughter', 'former', 'owner', 'little', 'girl', 'had', 'known', 'there', 'meet', 'Katherine', 'very', 'unique', 'daughter', 'forgotten', 'one', 'visit', 'made', 'child', 'memory', 'ever', 'having', 'known', 'Terry', 'not', 'tell', 'otherwise', 'story', 'interesting', 'turns', 'movie', 'serious', 'issues', 'dysfunctional', 'families', 'grief', 'homelessness', 'adoption', 'disabilities', 'deception', 'course', 'romance', 'air', 'also', 'intrigue', 'learn', 'fate', 'Katharine', 'father', 'storyline', 'interest', 'characters', 'are', 'not', 'one', 'dimensional', 'acting', 'good', 'movie', 'well', 'viewing', 'highly', 'recommend', 'have', 'young', 'children', 'might', 'be', 'little', 'deep', 'time', 'writing', 'price', 'movie', 'marketplace', 'sellers', 'started', '35', ""n't"", 'drop', 'should', 'be', 'able', 'get', 'Hallmark', 'store', '20', 'website', 'additional', '7', 'shipping']",N/A
