Jensen,"[0, 0]","I saw these movies many times when I was younger and preceded to watch them to death, checked them out recently (after five years of not viewing them) and fell in love with them again. Surprisingly I appreciate these films even more now, as when I was younger all I watched them for was the comedy aspect. But now, I find these just as entertaining as all the story archs between family members and life lessons displayed in these, mean a lot more to me now (having expereinced a couple of them myself).There are a few nitpicks I have with them (check my reviews on them) but this easily gets 5/5 as these are trully well done movies that can be enjoyed by adults and children alike.",5,Good combo pack,1394928000,"03 16, 2014",2014,683,"['saw', 'movies', 'many', 'times', 'when', 'was', 'younger', 'preceded', 'watch', 'death', 'checked', 'out', 'recently', 'five', 'years', 'not', 'viewing', 'fell', 'love', 'again', 'Surprisingly', 'appreciate', 'films', 'even', 'more', 'now', 'when', 'was', 'younger', 'watched', 'was', 'comedy', 'aspect', 'now', 'find', 'just', 'as', 'entertaining', 'story', 'archs', 'family', 'members', 'life', 'lessons', 'displayed', 'mean', 'lot', 'more', 'now', 'having', 'expereinced', 'couple', 'are', 'few', 'nitpicks', 'have', 'check', 'reviews', 'easily', '5/5', 'are', 'trully', 'well', 'done', 'movies', 'can', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'adults', 'children', 'alike']",Cheaper by the Dozen - 2 Movie Giftset

988349,A2S3ALXAUNH9FJ,B000FDEV4S,Treker,"[1, 1]","This is a family movie all the way.  It's totally hilarious and funny (I personally think that the average middle aged person today doesn't know what funny is cause they've grown up with a very ""sick"" type of humor).  This is clean, funny and I watch it over and over and never get tired of it.  I look forward to having my grandchildren watch it someday with me and I know they'll love it too.  It's nice that there is humor around that doesn't have to be sexual in nature (altho they try to use sexual humor with the one woman in it....you'll know who when you see her).
