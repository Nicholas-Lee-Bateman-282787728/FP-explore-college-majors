So we went, expecting only to enjoy seeing his credit line.But surprise, surprise, the film was a delightful way to spend a summer afternoon with the teenage kids, and while the film does have a large dose of crude sex jokes and a tad of nudity, all of us came out very happy to have seen it.En route to work one morning via subway, Matt Saunders (Luke Wilson) is repeatedly urged by his best friend Vaughn Haige (Rainn Wilson) to introduce himself to Jenny (Uma Thurman), a mousy gallery worker who secretly doubles as the superhero, G-Girl. The introduction goes nowhere, until a mugger grabs Jenny's purse and runs out of the open subway doors, up the stairs and through the streets of New York.Saunders immediately takes off after him, gets the purse and is about to get away. But the thief hears Saunders' epithet and pursues him. Very impressed by Matt's chivalry, ""Jenny"" follows the thief and his pursuer, and unbeknown to Matt, actually rescues him, rather than the other way around. Thus the hysterical romance between simple human and mega female hero begins.Within a relatively short time, Jenny takes Matt home and tells him her truth--in fact, she shows him. She tells him about her high school friend Barry, now a shady character known by the public as Professor Bedlam (Eddie Izzard). One night when Barry and Jenny were out for a date, a meteorite hit earth nearby, she ran to see it, touched the burning stone, and acquired her powers, leaving Barry to pine for her.Matt, very impressed, likes Jenny well enough and is having a good time. So he continues a relationship he started with the intention of having a fling, nothing more. Unfortunately, G-Girl Jenny falls in love with Matt, who in turn is overwhelmed by her jealousy, especially in combination with her hyper-powers, and many apparent neuroses.Bad enough to ensure the wrath of a woman scorned, but Matt faces the brunt of this wrath from an overcharged super-hero.Meanwhile, at work, Matt is friendly with Hannah (Anna Faris), who is dating a male bimbo and is unavailable --- until she finds out that the hunk cheated on her, and calls Matt for solace. That's when the real trouble starts.It all works out in the end, with great laughs and fun along the way. Our whole family loved the film --- not only my husband's credit line.Maybe there's something to that old clich&eacute;, one enjoys things most when expecting the least.--Alyssa A.

I find her extremely captivating as an actress.  She is oddly attractive, but it is in her flaws that she shines as a greatly effecting actress.  Her career is a conundrum to me though.  How can someone so talented become to ridiculously underused?  She appears in trashy films that are so far beneath her talent it is appalling.  This one is kind of in that category.  It isn't really worth a lot, but thankfully Thurman is interesting enough to make this film palatable.The film basically follows a very boring man named Matt (I have never understood the idea that Luke Wilson is a good choice for leading man...he has NO charm) who is dating this very needy and high-strung woman named Jenny who also happens to be a superhero.  Once he puts two and two together, he decides to dump her (as politely as possible) so that he can pursue his feelings for a colleague.  That, obviously, doesn't go over too well.Thank you Uma for giving this everything you've got, even if it doesn't deserve you.When all is said and done, you will laugh and you may actually enjoy yourself.  Sadly, this premise could have done a major facelift and could have actually been something very, very enjoyable.

1024995,A1NSMQIF1C2VCE,B000J4QW8Q,Beau Yarbrough,"[1, 1]","Given the low cost and high power of computer generated special effects, superhero movies are all the rage in Hollywood, from the revival of the Batman and Superman franchises, the continuing success of the Spider-Man franchise, the spectacle of Tim Allen as a superhero, and so on. So it's not a surprise that someone would take CGI firepower and use it in a comedy, My Super Ex-Girlfriend, and with Uma Thurman as the titular superhero ex-girlfriend, they have someone who could credibly pull it off.But what certainly seems like a clever Saturday Night Live bit never really does more than could be done in about four minutes on a Saturday night. The movie is padded with meeting the characters, seeing the relationship blossom, giving a reason for them to break up, THEN finally getting the break-up before having a somewhat forced resolution, ending the best part of the movie for the sake of it being a conventional film.The best stuff that you've certainly seen in the commercials -- G-Girl twisting a butcher knife with her bare hands during the break-up, flying off and busting through her now ex-boyfriend's roof, flinging a live killer shark through a window -- that's all from the sequence in the middle, when she's in deranged ex-girlfriend mode. The other stuff that's added on, including a tiresome Lex Luthor-like nemesis, is what drags this film down. (And with all the padding, we never get the only interesting backstory: What G-Girl means, other than a blink-and-you-miss-it suggestion in a deleted scene that it might be a g-spot joke, which doesn't make sense for the characters at all.)It's not the fault of the supporting cast that they're underfoot. Rainn Wilson is good, as is Anna Faris, although Wanda Sykes is criminally wasted in this film. Eddie Izzard doesn't really get the chance to shine that he deserves: His archvillainous Professor Bedlam is, frankly, kind of a wuss and clearly no match for G-Girl in any sense.This isn't a bad way to spend an evening for a superhero fan: The good stuff is pretty good, the special effects are neat (G-Girl's flight and high-speed motion has a nice visual), there's a number of DC Comics references (G-Girl spinning like a top to suck the oxygen away from a fire, super-breath and fire-vision, a creepy tryst a half-mile above Manhattan set to dopey Superman I romantic music that terrifies Luke Wilson's non-flying character) and the performers do a good job with very ordinary material.But it's a rental for all but the most obsessive Uma Thurman or Luke Wilson fans.",3,A skit-size joke stretched to movie length,1167868800,"01 4, 2007",2007,2542,"['Given', 'low', 'cost', 'high', 'power', 'computer', 'generated', 'special', 'effects', 'superhero', 'movies', 'are', 'rage', 'Hollywood', 'revival', 'Batman', 'Superman', 'continuing', 'success', 'Spider-Man', 'franchise', 'spectacle', 'Tim', 'Allen', 'superhero', 'so', 'not', 'surprise', 'someone', 'would', 'take', 'CGI', 'firepower', 'use', 'comedy', 'My', 'Super', 'Ex-Girlfriend', 'Uma', 'Thurman', 'titular', 'superhero', 'ex-girlfriend', 'have', 'someone', 'who', 'could', 'credibly', 'pull', 'off.But', 'what', 'certainly', 'clever', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Live', 'bit', 'never', 'really', 'more', 'could', 'be', 'done', 'four', 'minutes', 'Saturday', 'night', 'movie', 'padded', 'meeting', 'characters', 'seeing', 'relationship', 'blossom', 'giving', 'reason', 'break', 'up', 'THEN', 'finally', 'getting', 'break-up', 'having', 'somewhat', 'forced', 'resolution', 'ending', 'best', 'part', 'movie', 'sake', 'being', 'conventional', 'film.The', 'best', 'stuff', ""'ve"", 'certainly', 'seen', 'commercials', 'G-Girl', 'twisting', 'butcher', 'knife', 'bare', 'break-up', 'flying', 'off', 'busting', 'now', 'ex-boyfriend', 'roof', 'flinging', 'live', 'killer', 'shark', 'window', 'sequence', 'middle', 'when', 'deranged', 'ex-girlfriend', 'mode', 'other', 'stuff', 'added', 'including', 'tiresome', 'Lex', 'Luthor-like', 'nemesis', 'what', 'film', 'down', 'padding', 'never', 'get', 'only', 'interesting', 'backstory', 'What', 'G-Girl', 'other', 'blink-and-you-miss-it', 'suggestion', 'deleted', 'scene', 'might', 'be', 'g-spot', 'joke', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'characters', 'not', 'fault', 'supporting', 'cast', ""'re"", 'underfoot', 'Rainn', 'Wilson', 'good', 'Anna', 'Faris', 'Wanda', 'Sykes', 'criminally', 'wasted', 'film', 'Eddie', 'Izzard', ""n't"", 'really', 'get', 'chance', 'shine', 'archvillainous', 'Professor', 'Bedlam', 'frankly', 'kind', 'wuss', 'clearly', 'match', 'G-Girl', 'sense.This', ""n't"", 'bad', 'way', 'spend', 'evening', 'superhero', 'fan', 'good', 'stuff', 'pretty', 'good', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'neat', 'G-Girl', 'flight', 'high-speed', 'motion', 'nice', 'visual', 'number', 'DC', 'Comics', 'references', 'G-Girl', 'spinning', 'top', 'suck', 'oxygen', 'away', 'fire', 'super-breath', 'fire-vision', 'creepy', 'tryst', 'half-mile', 'Manhattan', 'set', 'dopey', 'Superman', 'romantic', 'music', 'Luke', 'Wilson', 'non-flying', 'character', 'performers', 'do', 'good', 'job', 'very', 'ordinary', 'material.But', 'rental', 'most', 'obsessive', 'Uma', 'Thurman', 'Luke', 'Wilson', 'fans']",N/A

Etnyre ""roguemissive""","[3, 3]","I tend to be a little picky about which movies I watch, especially for those rare theaters visits, but to some degree for my rentals pick as well.  The factor I most often use to influence my decisions are the films' trailers.  Usually they are a decently reliable indicator of whether I will like a film, although once in a while it proves to be inaccurate.  Unfortunately, this was one of those times.We thought the trailers were funny and as a result, we figured that the movie would be as well.  Though there were some humorous moments, the bulk of the movie tended to bog down in its attempt at a quirky romantic comedy and its clumsy effort at still also being a slapstick comedy, with the resulting awkward moments and slow pacing.  The sappy and insipidly convenient ending is remarkably anti-climactic and so banal that people in the theater actually groaned aloud.Luke Wilson played his usual (invariably unchanging) character of the meek and whiney guy who is the Anglo-fied version of the traditional film nebbish who never gets a break or seems to have any particular strengths, but ultimately ends up on top.  Uma Thurman was funny in her role, but ultimately could not overcome the weak script and disappointing movie.  Anna Faris is likable and cute as always, but like Uma, she was in a weak film that she couldn't save.  Rainn Wilson, who does such an effective job as Dwight in NBC's ""The Office"", isn't as effectively cast in this role, though he does what he can.

Ivan Reitman (a big name director) directs My Super Ex-Girlfriend. The movie has its moments but fails miserably for the movie it could have been and was supposed to be (released as a summer blockbuster).G-Girl, played by Uma Thurman, is a super hero with Superman-like powers. When she's not out saving the world, she's a nerdy girl working at an art studio, and almost desperate for a boyfriend. Luke Wilson's character, Saunders, meets her and the hit it off on the first date. But after the 1st date, it is all down hill. G-Girl is CRAZY. That's the concept of a movie. How would your life be if your ex-girlfriend had super powers and used them to make your life miserable.The cast is pretty good. Rainn Wilson from the office is the quirky ladies man. Anna Farris is Saunder's best friend at work, and very pretty. Uma Thurman plays crazy perfectly. Wilson is his usual solid and dependable self. I liked the cast, and there were a few good one liners. The effects were realistic enough on my 32-inch TV. So, check this movie out, I guess.

Not creed, sex, across cultures, or, in this case, via superheroes.Relationships are tough enough without the added stress of super-secrets. You know, the type that forces one into the realm of isolationism so that they can keep their ""special gifts"" from the world. This is the life of G-Girl (Uma Thurman), an indestructible superwoman who flies the skies and saves humanity from disasters on a daily basis. Whether it's a rogue rocket or a burning building, G-Girl is there.But with this comes the fact that a relationship is impossible. Or so it seems. Matt Sanders (Luke Wilson) is on the subway one morning and spots G-Girl in her mild mannered disguise as Jenny Johnson, your everyday art store worker. Matt is immediately taken with Jenny, and when a thug steals G-Girl's purse, Matt chases after him and sort of retrieves it (with a smidgin of unwitnessed help from G-Girl). G-Girl/Jenny is smitten with Matt for his bravery and the two quickly start dating. With the dating scene comes the juxtaposed problems that infuse G-Girl's life. She has no interpersonal skills with laymen yet desires to be close to someone. Anyone! Her near neurotic behavior quickly surfaces, and by the second date, sex is on the evening's ending menu. When she breaks Matt's bed (and nearly his manhood), he begins to wonder what the hell is going on. Knowing that she can't keep her identity secret from Matt, G-Girl confides in him, to Matt's great excitement (""I laid G-Girl!"") But the excitement vanishes as Matt learns how deeply disturbed his new superlover is. When he breaks up with her, the threat is physically real. She punches holes in his apartment roof as she launches herself into flight, steal his car and puts it in orbit, lazer burns the four letter word for a man's sexual organ onto Matt's forehead with her supervision, and even throws a great white shark at him and his new girlfriend (Hannah Lewis played by Anna Faris). How do you break up with a superhero? Especially one that's completely crazy?!Coming off the heals of the KILL BILL films, one couldn't picture a more perfect part for Uma Thurman. Her demented behavior was excellent, and she mixed it well with her brand of physical acting. The biggest worry might be Luke Wilson. His choice of questionable film roles (IDIOCRACY, etc.) could steer movie watchers away from this flick; that and some of the more flaming reviews. But these detractors should not be heeded. This is a pretty funny film that'll have folks laughing at the ridiculous and unexpected relationship turns that await the main characters.Also a nod is deserved for the hilarious antics of Luke's friend Vaughn played by Rainn Wilson and the dastardly Professor Bedlam played by Eddie Izzard who happens to be secretly in love with G-Girl and is equally as emasculated as Luke in the end.",4,Superhero = Super-Neurosis,1168905600,"01 16, 2007",2007,2853,"['Neurosis', 'bounds', 'Not', 'creed', 'sex', 'cultures', 'case', 'superheroes.Relationships', 'are', 'tough', 'enough', 'added', 'stress', 'super-secrets', 'know', 'type', 'one', 'realm', 'isolationism', 'can', 'keep', 'special', 'gifts', 'world', 'life', 'G-Girl', 'Uma', 'Thurman', 'indestructible', 'superwoman', 'who', 'skies', 'saves', 'humanity', 'disasters', 'daily', 'basis', 'rogue', 'rocket', 'burning', 'building', 'G-Girl', 'there.But', 'fact', 'relationship', 'impossible', 'Matt', 'Sanders', 'Luke', 'Wilson', 'subway', 'one', 'morning', 'spots', 'G-Girl', 'mild', 'mannered', 'disguise', 'Jenny', 'Johnson', 'everyday', 'art', 'store', 'worker', 'Matt', 'immediately', 'taken', 'Jenny', 'when', 'thug', 'G-Girl', 'purse', 'Matt', 'sort', 'retrieves', 'smidgin', 'unwitnessed', 'help', 'G-Girl', 'G-Girl/Jenny', 'smitten', 'Matt', 'bravery', 'two', 'quickly', 'start', 'dating', 'dating', 'scene', 'juxtaposed', 'problems', 'infuse', 'G-Girl', 'life', 'interpersonal', 'skills', 'laymen', 'yet', 'be', 'close', 'someone', 'Anyone', 'near', 'neurotic', 'behavior', 'quickly', 'surfaces', 'second', 'date', 'sex', 'evening', 'ending', 'menu', 'When', 'Matt', 'bed', 'nearly', 'manhood', 'wonder', 'what', 'hell', 'going', 'Knowing', 'ca', ""n't"", 'keep', 'identity', 'secret', 'Matt', 'G-Girl', 'confides', 'Matt', 'great', 'excitement', 'laid', 'G-Girl', 'excitement', 'vanishes', 'Matt', 'how', 'deeply', 'disturbed', 'new', 'superlover', 'When', 'up', 'threat', 'physically', 'real', 'holes', 'apartment', 'roof', 'flight', 'steal', 'car', 'orbit', 'lazer', 'four', 'letter', 'word', 'man', 'sexual', 'organ', 'Matt', 'forehead', 'supervision', 'even', 'great', 'white', 'shark', 'new', 'girlfriend', 'Hannah', 'Lewis', 'played', 'Anna', 'Faris', 'How', 'do', 'break', 'up', 'superhero', 'Especially', 'one', 'completely', 'crazy', 'Coming', 'off', 'heals', 'KILL', 'BILL', 'films', 'one', 'could', ""n't"", 'picture', 'more', 'perfect', 'part', 'Uma', 'Thurman', 'demented', 'behavior', 'was', 'excellent', 'mixed', 'well', 'brand', 'physical', 'acting', 'biggest', 'worry', 'might', 'be', 'Luke', 'Wilson', 'choice', 'questionable', 'film', 'roles', 'IDIOCRACY', 'etc', 'could', 'steer', 'movie', 'watchers', 'away', 'flick', 'more', 'flaming', 'reviews', 'detractors', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'heeded', 'pretty', 'funny', 'film', ""'ll"", 'have', 'folks', 'laughing', 'ridiculous', 'unexpected', 'relationship', 'await', 'main', 'characters.Also', 'nod', 'deserved', 'hilarious', 'antics', 'Luke', 'friend', 'Vaughn', 'played', 'Rainn', 'Wilson', 'dastardly', 'Professor', 'Bedlam', 'played', 'Eddie', 'Izzard', 'who', 'be', 'secretly', 'love', 'G-Girl', 'equally', 'as', 'emasculated', 'Luke', 'end']",N/A
1025002,AYC3Y4QX7GATV,B000J4QW8Q,"Bob Dog ""My Thoughts""","[10, 11]","This movie combined two of my favorites - Ivan Reitman and Uma Thurman.  It did not hit my sky high expectations, but I enjoyed it anyway because of these two amazing and talented people.  There were plenty of great scenes - I laughed the loudest when I saw the car in orbit with ""you suck"" written on it.Fundamentally, this movie tries to be funny and to a lesser extent, serious at the same time, a tightrope that's just too narrow to walk.  I think if the studio guys had just left well enough alone, and let Ivan HAVE AS MUCH FUN AS HE WANTED, this could have been another classic.  I like the story idea, but we should have left the ""seriousness"" to spider and batman.  More gags, pranks, one-liners, sexual humor (the bed smashing through the wall was fun), w/no physical injuries would have been fabulous.  G-Girl should have been allowed to torment her boyfriend without anyone getting hurt.  That would have been fun.  The villian was under developed.  He could have been more..., and the script didn't allow Uma to do as much as she could have.Also, the animated ""shark"" scene seemed out of place.  It didn't belong in the movie, not just because of the animation, but because it was too threatening - G-Girls revenge should have remained mostly funny (like the car in orbit, etc.).""G-Girl"" introduced me to Anna Faris.  She was very sweet and funny.  She has done alot of slapstick type films, but I think she'd be worthy in a drama.Like I said in an earlier review, I'd enjoy watching Uma solve a rubix cube, but I'd have to add to that any other boring activity that would come alive with Uma's participation, such as taking a driving test, mowing the lawn, or washing dishes, etc.,  she is fantastic just being in existance, just being alive.  As for Ivan, I'm going to blame his subdued handling of this film as constraint from the studio.

She could fly over the city with you, whip up a gourmet meal in seconds with heat vision, get you anywhere you needed to be on time, and even step in to protect you if Lex Luthor finally took over the city. What comic fanboy hasn't at some time imagined being able to tell his friends, ""Yeah, well my girlfriend can pick up Manhattan Island!""But what if she had a jealous streak? And what if she was just plain unstable?That's the premise of ""My Super Ex-Girlfriend"". Luke Wilson stars as Matt Saunders, a guy with a history of dating crazy women. On a subway, he notices quiet and unassuming Jenny Johnson (played by Uma Thurman) and they don't hit it off at all--until a Matt tries to stop a purse snatcher. Jenny, who's always saving other people as G-Girl, is smitten by this man who finally tried to save her, and they start dating. There are a few suspicious moments for Matt at the beginning of the relationship, but when Jenny finally reveals her secret to him, it all makes sense. It seems like the perfect relationship and any guy's dream: a superhero for a girlfriend.Then Matt notices a side of Jenny he hadn't paid attention to before. She's jealous, controlling, and manipulative. Bad enough to face that in a normal person, but when she has super powers it's worse. When Matt tries to break things off with her, he suddenly finds himself the target of a superhero's anger (never a good thing).MSEG looks at both sides of the coin in a relationship with a super hero. First, there's all the fun you can have. But then you see just how dangerous it could be (ever had a live shark thrown at you?). Thurman does a good job as the slightly psychotic G-Girl (no one knows what the ""G"" stands for, by the way). Her Amazonian physique makes her a natural for the super-hero scene. Wilson is hilarious. His facial expressions alone get him further than most of his lines do. Anna Faris plays Hannah, Matt's co-worker that he secretly has a crush on. It's funny to watch her in this movie because she got to play the psychotic girlfriend in last year's ""Best Friends"", while this time she's the normal one.And what's a superhero without an arch-villain? Eddie Izzard plays Professor Bedlam, the mad scientist supervillain out to destroy G-Girl. Why would he want to do such a thing? That little back story adds to the magic of the tale, and it really makes sense.The special effects in this movie aren't the best, but they're good. It seems like Wilson and Thurman mostly just ham it up for the camera when they're supposed to be flying, which adds to the comedy. It's almost like they're telling the audience, ""Yeah, we know this doesn't look real, but let's just have fun with it.""My Super Ex-Girlfriend touches on themes from a lot of hero myths and rolls them into a pretty funny movie. I can just see Superman taking Lois Lane to see this, turning to her after it's over and saying, ""Might want to keep all that in mind.""Dating a superhero isn't necessarily all it's cracked up to be.",4,No fury like a woman scorned--especially if she can throw a building at you!,1153526400,"07 22, 2006",2006,3082,"['Ever', 'wonder', 'what', 'would', 'be', 'date', 'Super-Girl', 'mean', 'look', 'fun', 'could', 'fly', 'city', 'whip', 'up', 'gourmet', 'meal', 'seconds', 'heat', 'vision', 'get', 'anywhere', 'needed', 'be', 'time', 'even', 'step', 'protect', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'finally', 'took', 'over', 'city', 'What', 'comic', 'fanboy', ""n't"", 'time', 'imagined', 'being', 'able', 'tell', 'friends', 'Yeah', 'well', 'girlfriend', 'can', 'pick', 'up', 'Manhattan', 'Island', 'what', 'had', 'jealous', 'streak', 'what', 'was', 'just', 'plain', 'unstable', 'premise', 'Super', 'Ex-Girlfriend', 'Luke', 'Wilson', 'Matt', 'Saunders', 'guy', 'history', 'dating', 'crazy', 'women', 'subway', 'quiet', 'unassuming', 'Jenny', 'Johnson', 'played', 'Uma', 'Thurman', 'do', ""n't"", 'hit', 'off', 'Matt', 'tries', 'stop', 'purse', 'snatcher', 'Jenny', 'who', 'always', 'saving', 'other', 'people', 'G-Girl', 'smitten', 'man', 'who', 'finally', 'tried', 'save', 'start', 'dating', 'are', 'few', 'suspicious', 'moments', 'Matt', 'beginning', 'relationship', 'when', 'Jenny', 'finally', 'secret', 'sense', 'perfect', 'relationship', 'guy', 'dream', 'superhero', 'girlfriend.Then', 'Matt', 'side', 'Jenny', 'had', ""n't"", 'paid', 'attention', 'jealous', 'controlling', 'manipulative', 'Bad', 'enough', 'face', 'normal', 'person', 'when', 'super', 'powers', 'worse', 'When', 'Matt', 'break', 'things', 'suddenly', 'target', 'superhero', 'anger', 'never', 'good', 'thing', '.MSEG', 'sides', 'coin', 'relationship', 'super', 'hero', 'First', 'fun', 'can', 'have', 'then', 'see', 'just', 'how', 'dangerous', 'could', 'be', 'ever', 'had', 'live', 'shark', 'thrown', 'Thurman', 'good', 'job', 'slightly', 'psychotic', 'G-Girl', 'one', 'what', 'G', 'way', 'Amazonian', 'physique', 'natural', 'super-hero', 'scene', 'Wilson', 'hilarious', 'facial', 'expressions', 'alone', 'get', 'further', 'most', 'lines', 'do', 'Anna', 'Faris', 'Hannah', 'Matt', 'co-worker', 'secretly', 'crush', 'funny', 'watch', 'movie', 'got', 'play', 'psychotic', 'girlfriend', 'last', 'year', 'Best', 'Friends', 'time', 'normal', 'one.And', 'what', 'superhero', 'arch-villain', 'Eddie', 'Izzard', 'Professor', 'Bedlam', 'mad', 'scientist', 'supervillain', 'destroy', 'G-Girl', 'Why', 'would', 'want', 'do', 'thing', 'little', 'back', 'story', 'magic', 'tale', 'really', 'sense.The', 'special', 'effects', 'movie', 'are', ""n't"", 'best', ""'re"", 'good', 'Wilson', 'Thurman', 'mostly', 'just', 'ham', 'up', 'camera', 'when', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'be', 'flying', 'comedy', 'almost', ""'re"", 'telling', 'audience', 'Yeah', 'know', ""n't"", 'look', 'real', 'let', 'just', 'have', 'fun', 'Super', 'Ex-Girlfriend', 'touches', 'themes', 'lot', 'hero', 'myths', 'rolls', 'pretty', 'funny', 'movie', 'can', 'just', 'see', 'Superman', 'taking', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'see', 'turning', 'saying', 'Might', 'want', 'keep', 'mind', 'Dating', 'superhero', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'all', 'cracked', 'up', 'be']",N/A

Er...perhaps not.""My Super Ex-Girlfriend"" manages to deliver a few laughs, but unfortunately falls a little short in it's ambitious attempt to bring the very separate worlds of comic book super-heroes and romantic comedies together. While this combination certainly has a lot of promise, it doesn't translate well onto film.QUICK SYNOPSIS: Matt Saunders is a New York architect who's had more than his share of bad luck with women. After he manages to score a date with a beautiful woman he meets on the subway, Matt begins to feel his luck may finally be turning around...or so he thought. As it turns out, his taste in women is just as bad as ever. He soon discovers that his new neurotic and jealous girlfriend is really G-Girl, New York City's very own super-hero. But when Matt tries to break it off with his psychotic girlfriend in pursuit of another woman he thinks he might be in love with, Matt quickly discovers the terrible wrath of a super-hero scorned.As I said before, there are certainly some funny moments in this film, but not enough to really redeem itself. The high-flying techniques of G-Girl look a lot like bad wire-work, and it's very noticable throughout the film. While Luke Wilson's comedic turn as Matt Saunders is relateable in a stereotypical way, his character is not endearing enough to be truly likeable. SPOILER ALERT: One thing that bothered me about Luke Wilson's character was his inherent selfishness in the end. While things turned out okay (I won't give anything away there) Matt Saunders was only looking out for himself, and he was only concerned with his personal comfort. While I'm sure it's no picnic having a jealous super-hero terrorizing your life, at the same time why did it not occur to him that by trying to take away her super-powers he was depriving the world of a super-hero who, at the end of the day, truly saves lives?Uma Thurman, on the other hand, plays the obsessive super-hero very well. Although I prefer her turn as a vengeful bride in the ""Kill Bills"", I found that she still managed to bring a certain softness and vulnerability to a character thats meant to be mostly unlikeable. I saw in her an insecure female with the weight of the world on her shoulders, who's just trying to learn how to have a romantic relationship with someone while still trying to be the super-hero she's meant to be. I'm sure that would be pretty difficult, so I'm not sure she should be faulted too much for her neuroticism.The ending is a bit contrived, but thats not saying much in a film where the viewer has to suspend a huge chunk of reality just to watch it (as we all must do with any super-hero movie). Bad wire stunts aside, this film is moderately entertaining, even if it's not a masterpiece. I'm a personal believer in the idea that a film doesn't have to be in contention for an Academy Award to be entertaining, and this movie certainly falls in that category.",3,"Heroic attempt, but gets lost in translation",1166140800,"12 15, 2006",2006,3028,"['psychotic', 'neurotic', 'jealous', 'manipulative', 'super-hero', 'man', 'idea', 'perfect', 'girlfriend', 'right', 'Er', 'perhaps', 'not', 'Super', 'Ex-Girlfriend', 'manages', 'deliver', 'few', 'laughs', 'unfortunately', 'little', 'short', 'ambitious', 'attempt', 'bring', 'very', 'separate', 'worlds', 'comic', 'book', 'super-heroes', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'together', 'combination', 'certainly', 'lot', 'promise', ""n't"", 'translate', 'well', 'film.QUICK', 'SYNOPSIS', 'Matt', 'Saunders', 'New', 'York', 'architect', 'who', 'had', 'more', 'share', 'bad', 'luck', 'women', 'score', 'date', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'subway', 'Matt', 'feel', 'luck', 'may', 'finally', 'be', 'turning', 'around', 'so', 'thought', 'out', 'taste', 'women', 'just', 'as', 'bad', 'ever', 'soon', 'new', 'neurotic', 'jealous', 'girlfriend', 'really', 'G-Girl', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'very', 'own', 'super-hero', 'when', 'Matt', 'break', 'off', 'psychotic', 'girlfriend', 'pursuit', 'woman', 'might', 'be', 'love', 'Matt', 'quickly', 'terrible', 'wrath', 'super-hero', 'scorned.As', 'said', 'are', 'certainly', 'funny', 'moments', 'film', 'not', 'enough', 'really', 'redeem', 'high-flying', 'techniques', 'G-Girl', 'look', 'lot', 'bad', 'wire-work', 'very', 'noticable', 'film', 'Luke', 'Wilson', 'comedic', 'turn', 'Matt', 'Saunders', 'relateable', 'stereotypical', 'way', 'character', 'not', 'endearing', 'enough', 'be', 'truly', 'likeable', 'SPOILER', 'ALERT', 'One', 'thing', 'bothered', 'Luke', 'Wilson', 'character', 'was', 'inherent', 'selfishness', 'end', 'things', 'turned', 'out', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'anything', 'away', 'Matt', 'Saunders', 'was', 'only', 'looking', 'out', 'was', 'only', 'concerned', 'personal', 'comfort', ""'m"", 'sure', 'picnic', 'having', 'jealous', 'super-hero', 'terrorizing', 'life', 'same', 'time', 'why', 'did', 'not', 'occur', 'trying', 'take', 'away', 'super-powers', 'was', 'depriving', 'world', 'super-hero', 'who', 'end', 'day', 'truly', 'lives', 'Uma', 'Thurman', 'other', 'hand', 'obsessive', 'super-hero', 'very', 'well', 'prefer', 'turn', 'vengeful', 'bride', 'Kill', 'Bills', 'found', 'still', 'managed', 'bring', 'certain', 'softness', 'vulnerability', 'character', 'thats', 'meant', 'be', 'mostly', 'unlikeable', 'saw', 'insecure', 'female', 'weight', 'world', 'shoulders', 'who', 'just', 'trying', 'learn', 'how', 'have', 'romantic', 'relationship', 'someone', 'still', 'trying', 'be', 'super-hero', 'meant', 'be', ""'m"", 'sure', 'would', 'be', 'pretty', 'difficult', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'should', 'be', 'faulted', 'too', 'much', 'neuroticism.The', 'ending', 'bit', 'contrived', 'not', 'saying', 'much', 'film', 'where', 'viewer', 'suspend', 'huge', 'chunk', 'reality', 'just', 'watch', 'must', 'do', 'super-hero', 'movie', 'Bad', 'wire', 'stunts', 'aside', 'film', 'moderately', 'entertaining', 'even', 'not', 'masterpiece', ""'m"", 'personal', 'believer', 'idea', 'film', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'contention', 'Academy', 'Award', 'be', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'certainly', 'category']",N/A

And that's where things start to get complicated.However the hole on the plotline often goes that with G-Girl's superhearing powers ( a thing often mentioned even in the movie), how come the characters were able to cook up something behind G-Girl's back. Something that'd went unexplained.On another note, Anna Farris plays Hannah Lewis, who did her part very well in the movie as Matt's colleague that happens to be taken by Matt herself, but has a model guy for a boyfriend. In the middle of the flick I can't hardly believe that she kinda looked somewhat like a digitalized resemblance of Britney Spears that I suspected she was, until I read the credits. And of course she looked a lot damn prettier than the then-child STAR SEARCH contestant turned you-know-what. And I also nearly mistook Izzard for Mark Hammill, maybe when the Luke Skywalker actor ages some more, he'd definitely look a lot like Eddie Izzard. Uhrmp, just a side note though...And as for the ever foxy Uma Thurman - she's one of the best hottest chicks who've ever came up from the planet of Hollywood , and still is. She got me captivated since one of her first earliest roles from Terry Gilliam's BARRY MUNCHOUSEN flick.And what a role she played that was. Lordy... (sighs)Actually, Thurman played a blind character before as a behounded gal on Jennifer 8, kinda like simialr to the roles played before by Mia Farrow, and Audrey Hepburn on one of the most excellent crime-schlock flicks -- WAIT UNTIL DARK.Say howzabout another duel with Daryl Hannah as the blind swords-woman, for KILL BILL Part Three! that'll be an interestingly nice concept for another sequel to the Kill Bill movies isn't it? hearken, kudos to me I guess.Moreover, all ends well that ends well for our heroine in this flick - but of course, we ain't just gonna spill.RATE: 7 out 0f 1O notches",3,The Story of a Super JENNY,1155772800,"08 17, 2006",2006,3195,"['Got', 'late', 'time', 'be', 'shown', 'lokal', 'dilapidated', 'shores', 'when', 'only', 'opened', 'yesterday', 'Manila', 'just', 'got', 'back', 'watching', 'movie', 'DOLBY', 'Digital', 'only', 'got', 'little', 'too', 'close', 'screen', 'doing', 'little', 'troubleshooting', 'sorts', 'pc', ""'m"", 'using', 'post', 'little', 'review', 'thought', 'just', 'crashed', '.This', 'flick', 'directed', 'GHOSTBUSTER', 'filmmaker', 'Ivan', 'Reitman', 'together', 'SIMPSONS', 'writer', 'Don', 'Payne', 'collaborated', 'did', 'splendid', 'job', 'making', 'great', 'spin', 'whole', 'super-hero', 'ine', 'storyline', 'thing', 'where', 'Uma', 'Thurman', 'Jenny', 'Johnson', 'geek', 'who', 'inherited', 'superpowers', 'similar', 'DC', 'Superman', 'meteor', 'earth', 'one', 'night', 'making', 'out', 'high', 'school', 'boyfriend', 'Barry', 'played', 'good', 'comedian', 'who', 'turned', 'straight', 'Eddie', 'Izzard', 'became', 'G-Girl', 'Uma', 'Thurman', 'super-heroine', 'alter', 'ego', 'arch-nemensis', 'adult', 'life', 'named', 'Bedlam.The', 'story', 'ran', 'when', 'bachelor', 'named', 'Matt', 'Saunders', 'played', 'Luke', 'Wilson', 'due', 'advice', 'ever-horny', 'friend', 'Rainn', 'Wilson', 'approach', 'Jenny', 'went', 'Matt', 'found', 'girlfriend', 'events', 'turn', 'out', 'when', 'found', 'out', 'Jenny', 'be', 'G-Girl', 'dump', 'felt', 'not', 'that', 'trying', 'break', 'up', 'woman', 'who', 'super-powers', 'where', 'things', 'start', 'get', 'complicated.However', 'hole', 'plotline', 'often', 'G-Girl', 'superhearing', 'powers', 'thing', 'often', 'mentioned', 'even', 'movie', 'how', 'come', 'characters', 'were', 'able', 'cook', 'up', 'something', 'G-Girl', 'back', 'Something', ""'d"", 'went', 'unexplained.On', 'note', 'Anna', 'Farris', 'Hannah', 'Lewis', 'who', 'did', 'part', 'very', 'well', 'movie', 'Matt', 'colleague', 'be', 'taken', 'Matt', 'model', 'guy', 'boyfriend', 'middle', 'flick', 'ca', ""n't"", 'hardly', 'believe', 'kinda', 'looked', 'somewhat', 'digitalized', 'resemblance', 'Britney', 'Spears', 'suspected', 'was', 'read', 'credits', 'course', 'looked', 'lot', 'damn', 'prettier', 'then-child', 'STAR', 'SEARCH', 'contestant', 'turned', 'you-know-what', 'also', 'nearly', 'mistook', 'Izzard', 'Mark', 'Hammill', 'maybe', 'when', 'Luke', 'Skywalker', 'actor', 'more', ""'d"", 'definitely', 'look', 'lot', 'Eddie', 'Izzard', 'Uhrmp', 'just', 'side', 'note', 'ever', 'foxy', 'Uma', 'Thurman', 'one', 'best', 'hottest', 'chicks', 'who', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'came', 'up', 'planet', 'Hollywood', 'still', 'got', 'captivated', 'one', 'first', 'earliest', 'roles', 'Terry', 'Gilliam', 'BARRY', 'MUNCHOUSEN', 'flick.And', 'what', 'role', 'played', 'was', 'Lordy', 'sighs', 'Actually', 'Thurman', 'played', 'blind', 'character', 'behounded', 'gal', 'Jennifer', '8', 'kinda', 'simialr', 'roles', 'played', 'Mia', 'Farrow', 'Audrey', 'Hepburn', 'one', 'most', 'excellent', 'crime-schlock', 'flicks', 'WAIT', 'UNTIL', 'DARK.Say', 'duel', 'Daryl', 'Hannah', 'blind', 'swords-woman', 'KILL', 'BILL', 'Part', 'Three', ""'ll"", 'be', 'interestingly', 'nice', 'concept', 'sequel', 'Kill', 'Bill', 'movies', ""n't"", 'hearken', 'kudos', 'guess.Moreover', 'ends', 'well', 'well', 'heroine', 'flick', 'course', 'ai', ""n't"", 'just', 'gon', 'spill.RATE', '7', '0f', '1O', 'notches']",N/A

If used sparingly it can be affective, but it is so overused that it looks like what it is, phony, fake, and unbelievable.The shark tossing scene in this movie looked horrible fake, like a cheap cartoon.

1025015,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B000J4QW8Q,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[1, 1]","Even though this film's oddly different premise had potential, My Secret Ex-Girlfriend had several things going against it: the presence of not one but two Wilsons, an obviously silly plot, the inclusion of a super villain named Professor Bedlam, and the fact that the writers couldn't come up with a better name for Uma Thurman's superhero character than G-Girl.  I mean, come on, G-Girl?  And they never even tell us what the G stands for.  Clearly, it's not a truncation of Good-Girl because G-Girl doesn't really live up to the good girl superhero standards.  Oh, she's fine at first, saving people's lives, stomping out crime in the big city, etc.  Get her in a relationship, though, and she transforms into a psycho hose beast of jealousy, instability, and possessiveness.  Poor Matt Saunders (Luke Wilson) didn't know what he was getting into when he asked a sort of mousey girl by the name of Jenny Johnson (Uma Thurman) out.  Admittedly, she was a little bit off from the start and tended to take an excessive number of bathroom breaks on any given date, but they really hit it off.  Even after she revealed her top secret identity to him, there was still magic in the air.  It wouldn't last.Jenny soon grows suspicious of Matt's hot co-worker Hannah Lewis (Anna Faris).  As an aside, I just have to say that I didn't even realize this was Anna Faris until the closing credits rolled.  She's adorable and seems to have a really hot Drew Barrymore kind of thing going for her here.  Around these parts, we'd say the girl has done growed up good.  Anyway, getting back to the story, things go downhill fast as Matt's attempts to ease himself out of the relationship get him nothing but vows of revenge.  Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned, and Jenny is no ordinary woman.  Your ordinary woman, no matter how mad she gets, isn't very likely to throw a live shark through the window of your high-rise apartment, for example.  If you're Matt, how the heck do you respond to something like that?I actually enjoyed this movie more than I expected to, as it does deliver a steady diet of laughs throughout.  Owen Wilson is the only Wilson brother I've grown to enjoy watching, but old Luke was pretty good here; he has just the right timing and facial expressions to make each scene work well.

1025021,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B000J4QW8Q,Ed Uyeshima,"[1, 1]","Uma Thurman is on quite a comedy roll with her May-September turn in ""Prime"", her elaborate variety act as Ulla in ""The Producers"" and now in the title role of this revenge-minded concoction from stalwart comedy director Ivan Reitman. Evolving into a crack comedienne, Thurman is ideally cast in the dual role of the almost-invincible blonde Amazon, G-Girl, and her alter ego, the uptight, bespectacled Jenny Johnson. Written with a deft but rather superficial hand by ""Simpsons"" veteran Don Payne, it's actually a terrific idea to reformat the extremities of ""Fatal Attraction"" within the superhero action genre, and the film definitely has its inspired moments. However, something feels strangely amiss in the execution of this overlong cartoon of a movie, as the film's absurdist humor never seems to bring the silly, action-packed situation to a level of humanity that resonates.The plot really focuses on the object of G-Girl's attention, Matt Saunders, a design firm project manager and regular Joe. By happenstance, he picks up an initially resistant Jenny on the subway. Through an act of unintentional heroism involving a purse-snatching, she decides to date him, and they immediately embark on a nightmare of a relationship. Isolated by the constraints of her dual identity, she turns out to be understandably neurotic, needy and obsessive. Meanwhile, Matt finds himself drawn to his work colleague, Hannah Lewis, who is otherwise taken but starts to reciprocate Matt's attraction. The moment of truth comes when Matt decides to dump Jenny, even though he knows she is G-Girl, and the rest of the story is inevitable.There are some hilarious sequences, one in particular, involving Jenny's petulant, self-absorbed delay in responding to an errant missile about to destroy New York City. There is also a funny take-off of the requisite superhero flashback when the geeky, teenaged Jenny finds her G-Girl superpowers in a glowing meteor. The rest of the movie simply does not hold up as well. With her outsized features and Nordic beauty, Thurman is easily commanding as G-Girl, and she seems to have fun playing up her character's mousy and vindictive sides as the story requires. But Luke Wilson, despite his innate likeability, is mostly a blank slate as Matt. He is certainly the requisite normal guy called for in the script, but his dilemma never feels palpable. Because Hannah is not nearly as interesting, an unusually sympathetic Anna Faris barely registers, and the dynamic of the romantic triangle sags.A decade too old for his part, the normally flamboyant Eddie Izzard is surprisingly stilted as the villainous Professor Bedlam, though his character's motivation for destroying G-Girl does bring a touch of welcome whimsy to the plot. The always sassy Wanda Sykes is wasted in the small role of Matt's obstreperous boss, and Rainn Wilson of ""The Office"" is an irritating presence as Matt's pal Vaughan. I was also disappointed at how visually dull the movie is, especially with the strenuous CGI images applied, when Reitman is obviously trying to emulate the current crop of superhero epics.

1025026,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B000J4QW8Q,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[3, 5]","When you get right down to it, there's really nothing much to say about this film (although I'll spend 5 paragraphs or so saying it). SPOILERS alert now. The plot, basically, involves romantically down-and-out architect Matt Saunders (Luke Wilson) - who seems to frustratingly attract crazy women -once again gaining an unstable girlfriend in Jenny Johnson (Uma Thurman), only to find out that her alter ego is the all-powerful superheroine G-Girl. Their romance goes well for a nano-second, but then Jenny's neurotic tendencies begin to surface and bug Matt, to the point where he shortly wants to end the relationship. Plus, he's been kind of in love with his co-worker, the cute and wholesome Hannah (Anna Faris).However, as Matt feared, Jenny doesn't take the break-up too kindly and, well, we all know the saying about the woman scorned...and when the woman in question has super powers, oboy! Pretty soon, Matt is tending to holes in his ceilings, his car orbiting the planet, peril for his fish, embarassing disturbances at the job, and sharks in the bedroom. And, with G-Girl's nemesis, the dastardly but besotten Professor Bedlam (Eddie Izzard), lurking somewhere, this can't possibly end well, can it?So, this concept is intriguing as the film tries to spin something different in the superhero genre. Or, put another way, this movie is more a relationship movie dressed up in comic book trappings. It does offer a certain limited insight on the sense of isolation superheroes feel as they go about doing their good deeds and how, sometimes, an act of kindness will engender from them feelings of surprise...and more. Jenny is first attracted to Matt because he helped her out in her civilian guise, something she's not used to as she's the one normally doing the saving. However, while it does have some modestly nifty special effects and trivial action sequences, MY SUPER EX-GIRLFRIEND is, as befitting the movie title, predominantly a romantic comedy - but, alas, a bland one. Luke Wilson playing the regular dude part is affable enough, though not as likable or as charmingly laid back as his cooler brother Owen. Anna Faris is cute enough and huggable. Eddie Izzard is reserved here compared to his stand up comedy acts (check out his DRESSED TO KILL dvd, it's hilarious), and Rainn Wilson and Wanda Sykes are just annoying. It's lead actress Uma Thurman who's burdened with the most challenging role. Uma has to play Jenny/G-Girl as loony and dangerously and pettily spiteful yet still maintain a modicum of likability so the audience could be sympathetic enough to buy into the predictable resolution. I'm still not certain she pulled it off.I'm not sure exactly what ingredients are missing here. The film certainly is energetic enough and there is ample humor. But it's definitely lacking something. Maybe it's that it's too predictable as the viewer, fairly early on, can see which way this story is heading. It might be the lack of chemistry between Luke Wilson and Uma Thurman, although Luke and Anna did emanate a certain burn. Maybe that was on purpose since we all can pretty much guess who Luke's character ends up with. If the filmmakers had cared to, they could've made this film as dark and vindictive as, say,THE WAR OF THE ROSES, instead of selling out with the easy ending. As a guy, I found MY SUPER EX-GIRLFRIEND to be mildly entertaining, certainly worth seeing once. I do get the feeling that femaledom might find it more to their liking as their break-up revenge fantasies are so ably embodied in G-Girl. Three stars and a mild recommendation.And this movie does offer a brief seminar on kissing and tongue-licking.By the way, there's isn't really much to the Bonus Features section: five deleted scenes, an extended shark sequence, and Molly McQueen's music video ""No Sleep 2 Nite.""

Or it could be just that the reviewer loved it. In this case, it means I believe the movie makers succeeded in creating a movie the target audience would approve of.This movie has crude humor and the concept of monogamous marriage didn't seem to register in the minds of the makers. While I see why it got a PG-13, I don't believe teens should see this movie, in my opinion, because it does promote promiscuity.Also, even though this movie seems to have a feminist leaning with the girl having super powers, I consider this film chauvinistic, aimed for a male audience. Why? Because the male lead is the protagonist and a decent guy, and the female lead moves from being a hero to a villain.I've pointed out my problems with this movie. However, the acting isn't.

Michael,"[1, 1]","This movie had a funny premise- imagine if your emotionally disturbed, paranoid, violent, neurotic basket-case of an ex-girlfriend also has super powers- and I think it was pulled off tolerably well. Mind you, a lot of it was definitely uncreative assembly-line humor so typical of Hollywood comedy, but I actually laughed out loud at some of the lines, as well as at the sheer unabashed silliness of the movie.

But then her purse is snatched and he runs after the thief to return it.  This act endears him to her and they start a relationship.  Little does he know that she is really the superhero known as G-Girl and that he was the first person to ever help her.  Bus soon he learns the truth and finds himself a target of her arch-nemesis.  This soon becomes too much to bear as G-Girl is rather neurotic so he tries to end the relationship.Ending a relationship with a woman of superhuman abilities is not so easy.  G-Girl begins a campaign against him and any woman he seems to like.  In one scene she throws a shark into his 30th-floor apartment.  Finally he teams up with her arch nemesis to try and restore order by removing her powers before she becomes too much of a danger.  Although the plan seems good at first, there are problems and new complications.  These are handled in new and original ways that help keep this film from being trite or tired.  Cartoon versions of the characters continue the story during the ending credits.No great cinema here, just a new take on a typical romantic comedy.  Many classic elements are here including the sleezeball sidekick.  But the final scenes and the plot resolutions do not follow the typical romantic comedy ideas.  In my opinion the ending actually saves and strengthens the earlier film.  Earlier parts of the film go through standard romantic comedy paces flavored with Uma Thurman's superhero abilities, and a lot of quick and cheap gags.  Unlike many superhero movies we don't get the two-part feeling that is typically done with an origin story followed by an adventure.  Here the origin story is done in the middle and works better that way.  If you are looking for something light, reasonably funny, and fairly original then this one might be for you.

1025039,A34792YZU3EH56,B000J4QW8Q,J. Swagman,"[4, 4]","This movie just came out last week on DVD in Japan. I rented it because it looked like a fun light hearted comedy that I wouldn't require any thinking. And that's pretty much what I got.Anyone who's seen the previews should be familiar with the premise. Luke Wilson plays an ordinary guy who, through accidents of circumstances, eventually finds himself dating a super hero. And then breaking up with her. And it turns out she doesn't handle break ups well.Although us comic book geek guys know that romances and subsequent break-ups are frequent story fodder and standard fare for comic books (which are pretty much soap operas for men), the idea of playing it for comedy is an original one.Unfortunately it's just a one note gag. Once you get the joke about the obsessive ex-girlfriend with super powers, the film doesn't have a lot else to offer.To his credit, the director seemed to have realized this in advance, and kept the timing pretty good. In this day and age of epic films that go on to long, this movie is trimmed down to a very watchable 90 minutes. Just when you're beginning to get bored with it, the film is over.There are a number of very funny people employed on this film (Luke Wilson, Eddie Izzard, Rainn Wilson, Wanda Sykes) but none of them are given any good material to work with. (With the possible exception of Rainn Wilson, who does a pretty good job playing as the jerk best friend character).I've been an Eddie Izzard fan every since college when a friend of mine came back from a semester abroad in England raving about this wonderful British comedian he discovered over there. Afterwards I looked up a lot of Eddie Izzard's stuff on the internet, and caught a few of his specials on cable, and generally enjoyed it.....I've since noticed Eddie Izzard has bit parts in a number of Hollywood movies, but he never really seems very funny in any of them. I guess no matter how good the comedian is, you're only really as funny as the material the writers give you.",3,"Essientially a one joke movie, but good sense of timing",1187740800,"08 22, 2007",2007,1992,"['movie', 'just', 'came', 'out', 'last', 'week', 'DVD', 'Japan', 'rented', 'looked', 'fun', 'light', 'hearted', 'comedy', 'would', ""n't"", 'require', 'thinking', 'pretty', 'much', 'what', 'got.Anyone', 'who', 'seen', 'previews', 'should', 'be', 'familiar', 'premise', 'Luke', 'Wilson', 'ordinary', 'guy', 'who', 'accidents', 'circumstances', 'eventually', 'dating', 'super', 'hero', 'then', 'breaking', 'up', 'out', ""n't"", 'handle', 'break', 'ups', 'comic', 'book', 'geek', 'guys', 'know', 'romances', 'subsequent', 'break-ups', 'are', 'frequent', 'story', 'fodder', 'standard', 'fare', 'comic', 'books', 'are', 'pretty', 'much', 'soap', 'operas', 'men', 'idea', 'playing', 'comedy', 'original', 'one.Unfortunately', 'just', 'one', 'note', 'gag', 'Once', 'get', 'joke', 'obsessive', 'ex-girlfriend', 'super', 'powers', 'film', ""n't"", 'have', 'lot', 'else', 'offer.To', 'credit', 'director', 'seemed', 'have', 'realized', 'advance', 'kept', 'timing', 'pretty', 'good', 'day', 'age', 'epic', 'films', 'go', 'long', 'movie', 'trimmed', 'down', 'very', 'watchable', '90', 'minutes', 'Just', 'when', ""'re"", 'beginning', 'get', 'bored', 'film', 'over.There', 'are', 'number', 'very', 'funny', 'people', 'employed', 'film', 'Luke', 'Wilson', 'Eddie', 'Izzard', 'Rainn', 'Wilson', 'Wanda', 'Sykes', 'none', 'are', 'given', 'good', 'material', 'work', 'possible', 'exception', 'Rainn', 'Wilson', 'who', 'pretty', 'good', 'job', 'playing', 'jerk', 'best', 'friend', 'character', ""'ve"", 'been', 'Eddie', 'Izzard', 'fan', 'college', 'when', 'friend', 'mine', 'came', 'back', 'semester', 'abroad', 'England', 'raving', 'wonderful', 'British', 'comedian', 'discovered', 'there', 'Afterwards', 'looked', 'up', 'lot', 'Eddie', 'Izzard', 'stuff', 'internet', 'caught', 'few', 'specials', 'cable', 'generally', 'enjoyed', ""'ve"", 'noticed', 'Eddie', 'Izzard', 'bit', 'parts', 'number', 'Hollywood', 'movies', 'never', 'really', 'very', 'funny', 'guess', 'matter', 'how', 'good', 'comedian', ""'re"", 'only', 'really', 'as', 'funny', 'material', 'writers', 'give']",N/A
1025040,A28GCEHD00JFZG,B000J4QW8Q,Julian Kennedy,"[3, 4]","My Super Ex-Girlfriend: 7 out of 10: Director Ivan Reitman hasn't had a great film since Ghostbusters. In fact for such a big name in Hollywood he has had only two great films (Ghostbusters and Stripes both over twenty years ago), one decent film (Dave), some quite mediocre films (Legal Eagle, Six Days Seven Nights, Junior, Kindergarten Cop, and Evolution) and some very serious flops(Fathers Day, Ghostbusters 2).So needless to say with that track record I expected a high concept comedy such as My Super Ex-Girlfriend to be mediocre at best. Instead it hung in tight at decent.The film had two personal aces in its corner with me. I like Uma Thurman and I just saw Superman Returns.The fact I had recently sat through two and a half hours of Superman stalking Lois Lane admittedly greatly added to the humor of this film. The main character actually seems to enjoy her super powers and this movie ironically is one of the more realistic demonstrations of how a mortal given superpowers would act. (Compare to the whining Jessica Alba lays on in Fantastic Four or the angst the X-men feel about not fitting in. If I could fly and shoot fireballs I assure you I would fit in. Hell I would be the center of bloody attention.)Some superheroes are designed to be dour types (Batman and the Punisher come to mind) but most come across like whining athletes. Thurman is clearly enjoying herself. Uma Thurman fits the role to a tee. In fact all the actors do a great job with special kudos to Anna Faris as the other woman.Sure some of the gags are juvenile and the movie really could have used an R-rating but when I get to see a super heroine throw a great white shark into the apartment of her rival I feel nothing but pure joy.It certainly beats some male model in a superman cape moping out side of Lois's house spying with his x-ray vision pretending to be Jesus.",4,My Super Ex-Girlfriend...

1025041,ALLJT7S5QOFFZ,B000J4QW8Q,kaduzy,"[4, 6]","When I heard about this movie, I thought the concept was fantastic.  It sounded like it would be a hilarious look at what it's like dating a person who turns out to be a superhero.  After all, you can't exactly have a normal relationship with someone who has to dash off to save the world can you?  This is an idea that has been done before in every superhero movie, but never mined for its full comic potential, and never with one important twist:The superhero is a girl!So what went wrong here?  This movie gets some well-deserved laughs in a few places, but for the most part it's just dead in the water.  There are so many chunks that just aren't funny at ALL and that are so badly written, it puzzles me how they made it past the first draft of the screenplay.  And as the movie goes on, those un-funny parts just get longer, and harder to sit through.For one thing, the casting is way off.  I don't know why Anna Farris keeps getting cast in movies, because she's a terrible actress and she isn't remotely attractive.  Luke Wilson is usually funny, but he lacks the charisma needed to pull off playing the male lead in this kind of movie.  There's no real chemistry between him and either of the two women he's supposed to be so into.  And don't get me started on the futility of Wanda Sykes.Uma Thurman, Eddie Izzard and Rainn Wilson are the only ones cast well in their parts, but they are given lines so terrible that there's not much they can do to rise above the material.  Izzard, in particular, is completely wasted.  If this movie had been better written and better directed, it would have been something really special.  As it is, it barely manages to be mediocre, and the closing credits are so horrendous that I raced out of the theater without even waiting to see if there was a tag.  It's too bad, really.

Matt (Luke Wilson) has a crush on Hanna (Anna Faris), but she has boyfriend.  Matt, at the suggestion of his friend Vaughn (Rain Wilson) asks out Jenny (Uma Thurman).  Jenny turns out to be two things; crazy, and a super heroine named G-Girl who possesses super strength, super speed, the ability to fly and she is nearly impervious to all forms of physical harm.  Well, she basically has Superman's powers.  She gained these from a meteor that blew up in front of her and her now jealous friend Barry, the super villain Professor Bedlam (Eddie Izzard).  Matt breaks up with Jenny and now has a chance to be with Hanna.  Jenny is crazy of course, so she gets jealous.  Traditionally, one may go down and file a restraining order but Jenny is capable of easily taking out an entire police force.  Uma Thurman is great as Jenny and as G-Girl.  She has a surprising knack for comedy here and it was a very good performance.Now lets go over the bad things about My Super Ex-Girlfriend. The film succeeds to some degree as a spoof of super hero movies but because it is merely capitalizing on the success of those films when the stories have existed for years, it didn't work for me and clearly seemed rushed.  My first complaint is that a lot of the jokes were also just not funny and there is nothing worse then when you know something is supposed to be funny but it isn't.  My second complaint is the main character Matt, played by Luke Wilson.  It isn't Luke's fault but the character is a gutless coward.  If this is the ""every-man"" in our culture then we must take a good look at the direction we're going in.  My third complaint has to do with the rating.  This film had about five sex scenes and it got a PG-13 rating.  People have a lot of sex in this movie but somehow they do this without removing any clothing, which was convenient because I'm sure the producers wanted to access that 12+ age demographic rather than limit the audience.  The reason this troubles me is that if there was just one comedic sex scene and it happened to show a nipple for a second we would have seen an R rating and that is ridiculous.  My fourth and final complaint about My Super Ex-Girlfriend was the soundtrack.  It was awful.  It was bad enough that I hated every song in the movie, but the songs also just didn't jibe with the scenes they were in and that was annoying.  I hate the song ""Jessie's Girl"" but it was used very wisely in Boogie Nights.Anyway, I almost hated this movie overall but there were some moments I can appreciate.  Especially Uma Thurman's G-Girl, she looked great and her action scenes were both comical and exciting. However, we probably won't see much like My Super Ex-Girlfriend for some time though as it didn't translate well at the box office.

When he meets Jenny Johnson (Uma Thurman) on the subway her mousy, plain exterior makes him think she's just what he needs to get back into the swing of things. At first she tries to blow him off, but when a purse snatcher runs away with her handbag, and Matt goes through the trouble of chasing him down, Jenny decides to give him a chance. Pretty soon after they start dating, Matt realizes that beneath her uptight facade, Jenny is more than a little neurotic. She's distant, has a volatile temper, and seems to disappear and come back somewhat worse for the wear. Finally, she confesses to Matt that she's really G Girl, the New York superhero who has saved their town from villainy more than once. Since she helps people every day and never gets helped in return, she couldn't help but fall for Matt when he chased her purse snatcher. After her secret is in the open, Jenny assumes that she and Matt will live happily ever after. Except, she's still a little neurotic only now Matt knows the reason. As her temper erupts more often and she becomes progressively more jealous, Matt decides to break things off. Only he didn't realize that you can't exactly break up with a superhero the way you could a normal girl...My Super Ex-Girlfriend has funny moments, but as a whole it's just an okay comedy. Luke Wilson and Uma Thurman never had the sort of chemistry that would make me believe she'd really lose it if he dumped her, even if the break up provided for some of the funnier scenes.

One, this film features a generic superhero, who isn't from Marvel or DC comics.  Comic fanatics are gonna want someone familiar.  G-Girl is like a modern version of Superman.Matt Saunders has trouble finding a new girl since his breakup 6 months ago.  His friend, Vaughn has spotted a ""librarian"" sitting in the Metro.  He encourages Matt to meet up with the gal.  The gal is Jenny.  Unknown to anyone, Jenny is G-Girl.The Jenny persona is somewhat opposite from the G-Girl persona.  Jenny isn't confident in herself and is quite a talker.  Anyways, Matt and Jenny go out on a date.  In the middle of the date, Jenny overhears a crime in action.  After providing an excuse, she takes off for the rescue.They date again.  However, they're being spied by a villian, Dr. Bedlam.  Bedlam is a childhood friend of Jenny, who once and still has a crush on her.  Bedlam is determined to steal her powers.Not long after they've started dating, Matt realizes that Jenny isn't for him.  He breaks the news to Jenny, which she does not take well.  Jenny, as G-Girl, uses her powers to make things hellish for Matt.Just what will it take for Jenny to stop?  That's for you to watch and find out.Overall, this film was ok.  There were just a couple of things that deemed the movie kinda cheesy.  For example, G-Girl arrives, by flight, outside of an apartment and tosses in a Great White shark.  I thought that was just stupid.Another thing, none of G-Girl's powers were unique.  Flight, just about every other hero has this ability.  Moving at the speed of light...Superman and the Flash.  Spinning, to douse or reduce,...Superman does that.  Blowing out cold air or sucking something back...another one of Superman's ability.  Laser beams shot out of eyes...gee, Superman does that too.Anyways, if you happen to watch this film, just to expect to be impressed.",3,just stick with Spider-Man if you want a rom-com...,1170115200,"01 30, 2007",2007,1937,"['*My', 'Super', 'Ex-Girlfriend*', 'was', 'not', 'bad', 'However', 'would', ""n't"", 'rave', 'movie', 'anyone', 'One', 'film', 'generic', 'superhero', 'who', ""n't"", 'Marvel', 'DC', 'comics', 'Comic', 'fanatics', 'are', 'gon', 'want', 'someone', 'familiar', 'G-Girl', 'modern', 'version', 'Superman.Matt', 'Saunders', 'trouble', 'finding', 'new', 'girl', 'breakup', '6', 'months', 'ago', 'friend', 'Vaughn', 'spotted', 'librarian', 'sitting', 'Metro', 'Matt', 'meet', 'up', 'gal', 'gal', 'Jenny', 'Unknown', 'anyone', 'Jenny', 'G-Girl.The', 'Jenny', 'persona', 'somewhat', 'opposite', 'G-Girl', 'persona', 'Jenny', ""n't"", 'confident', 'herself', 'quite', 'talker', 'Anyways', 'Matt', 'Jenny', 'go', 'out', 'date', 'middle', 'date', 'Jenny', 'crime', 'action', 'providing', 'excuse', 'rescue.They', 'date', 'again', 'However', ""'re"", 'being', 'spied', 'villian', 'Dr.', 'Bedlam', 'Bedlam', 'childhood', 'friend', 'Jenny', 'who', 'once', 'still', 'crush', 'Bedlam', 'determined', 'steal', 'powers.Not', 'long', ""'ve"", 'started', 'dating', 'Matt', 'Jenny', ""n't"", 'news', 'Jenny', 'not', 'take', 'well', 'Jenny', 'G-Girl', 'powers', 'make', 'things', 'hellish', 'Matt.Just', 'what', 'will', 'take', 'Jenny', 'stop', 'watch', 'find', 'out.Overall', 'film', 'was', 'ok', 'were', 'just', 'couple', 'things', 'deemed', 'movie', 'kinda', 'cheesy', 'example', 'G-Girl', 'arrives', 'flight', 'apartment', 'tosses', 'Great', 'White', 'shark', 'thought', 'was', 'just', 'stupid.Another', 'thing', 'none', 'G-Girl', 'powers', 'were', 'unique', 'Flight', 'just', 'other', 'hero', 'ability', 'Moving', 'speed', 'light', 'Superman', 'Flash', 'Spinning', 'douse', 'reduce', 'Superman', 'Blowing', 'out', 'cold', 'air', 'sucking', 'something', 'back', 'one', 'Superman', 'ability', 'Laser', 'beams', 'shot', 'eyes', 'gee', 'Superman', 'too.Anyways', 'happen', 'watch', 'film', 'just', 'expect', 'be', 'impressed']",N/A

However, this film is for adults rather than kids. A few scenes were a bit embarrassing or silly but most of the time I was falling about laughing.At the start of the film Matt Saunders (Luke Wilson) is a frustrated nerd looking for romance: ironically there is a colleage, Hannah (played by Anna Faris) in his office who he really likes and who is equally fond of him, but it would never occur to him to do anything about it because she already has a boyfriend.Then he meets and starts to date Jenny (Uma Thurman) - who appears from the outside to be a quiet mouselike art curator. But what the viewer knows, and Matt initially doesn't, is that Jenny is really ""G-girl"" - a superhero who is faster than a speeding bullet, more powerful than a locomotive, etc, etc.Being a superhero has had dire effects on Jenny's love life. The film manages a difficult balance extremely well in that you can both sympathise with Jenny and understand why she is the way she is, but also understand why Matt soon begins to find her impossible to cope with. But when he breaks up with her, she vows revenge - and becomes the super ex from hell. By comparison with G-Girl's idea of revenge, putting paint stripper on a guy's car or cutting up his shirts is nothing.Uma Thurman hasn't done many comic roles, but if this film is anything to go by, perhaps she should do a few more. Luke Wilson does a good job as the well-meaning but nerdish and very ordinary central character. Other good performances include Eddie Izzard who is superb as supervillain ""Professor Bedlam"" who is G-girl's arch enemy, and Anna Faris, who is excellent as the cute and innocent girl at Matt's office. The most disappointing part of the film is Wanda Sykes who plays Matt's boss. She has the role of being the worst possible person for all the most terribly embarrassing things to happen in front of (so of course they do). Most comedies have such a character, usually a senior manager, potential important customer, or a parent or grandparent of the heroine, but it isn't usually considered necessary to make that person quite as obnoxious as this character was: to such an extent that at one or two points when I should have been laughing I was getting annoyed with Matt's boss.But overall I can recommend this film and am glad I bought it.",4,Slapstick superhero comedy for adults - very funny,1165622400,"12 9, 2006",2006,2608,"['superhero', 'comedy', 'dating', 'breaking-up', 'what', 'Incredibles', 'did', 'family', 'other', 'words', 'lot', 'laughs', 'incongruity', 'imagining', 'how', 'difficulties', 'come', 'ordinary', 'human', 'life', 'would', 'be', 'even', 'worse', 'one', 'more', 'participants', 'superhuman', 'powers', 'However', 'film', 'adults', 'rather', 'kids', 'few', 'scenes', 'were', 'bit', 'embarrassing', 'silly', 'most', 'time', 'was', 'falling', 'start', 'film', 'Matt', 'Saunders', 'Luke', 'Wilson', 'frustrated', 'nerd', 'looking', 'romance', 'ironically', 'colleage', 'Hannah', 'played', 'Anna', 'Faris', 'office', 'who', 'really', 'who', 'equally', 'fond', 'would', 'never', 'occur', 'do', 'anything', 'already', 'boyfriend.Then', 'date', 'Jenny', 'Uma', 'Thurman', 'who', 'outside', 'be', 'quiet', 'mouselike', 'art', 'curator', 'what', 'viewer', 'Matt', 'initially', ""n't"", 'Jenny', 'really', 'G-girl', 'superhero', 'who', 'faster', 'speeding', 'bullet', 'more', 'powerful', 'locomotive', 'etc', 'etc.Being', 'superhero', 'had', 'dire', 'effects', 'Jenny', 'love', 'life', 'film', 'difficult', 'balance', 'extremely', 'well', 'can', 'both', 'sympathise', 'Jenny', 'understand', 'why', 'way', 'also', 'understand', 'why', 'Matt', 'soon', 'find', 'impossible', 'cope', 'when', 'up', 'revenge', 'super', 'ex', 'hell', 'comparison', 'G-Girl', 'idea', 'revenge', 'putting', 'paint', 'stripper', 'guy', 'car', 'cutting', 'up', 'shirts', 'nothing.Uma', 'Thurman', ""n't"", 'done', 'many', 'comic', 'roles', 'film', 'anything', 'go', 'perhaps', 'should', 'do', 'few', 'more', 'Luke', 'Wilson', 'good', 'job', 'well-meaning', 'nerdish', 'very', 'ordinary', 'central', 'character', 'Other', 'good', 'performances', 'include', 'Eddie', 'Izzard', 'who', 'superb', 'supervillain', 'Professor', 'Bedlam', 'who', 'G-girl', 'arch', 'enemy', 'Anna', 'Faris', 'who', 'excellent', 'cute', 'innocent', 'girl', 'Matt', 'office', 'most', 'disappointing', 'part', 'film', 'Wanda', 'Sykes', 'who', 'Matt', 'boss', 'role', 'being', 'worst', 'possible', 'person', 'most', 'terribly', 'embarrassing', 'things', 'happen', 'front', 'course', 'do', 'Most', 'comedies', 'have', 'character', 'usually', 'senior', 'manager', 'potential', 'important', 'customer', 'parent', 'grandparent', 'heroine', ""n't"", 'usually', 'considered', 'necessary', 'make', 'person', 'quite', 'as', 'obnoxious', 'character', 'was', 'extent', 'one', 'two', 'points', 'when', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'laughing', 'was', 'getting', 'annoyed', 'Matt', 'boss.But', 'overall', 'can', 'recommend', 'film', 'am', 'glad', 'bought']",N/A

1025057,A1SCD2NYTIAQTY,B000J4QW8Q,Mouldy Pilgrim,"[3, 3]","Although I have become a little worried about the number of romantic comedies I have seen recently, I have to say in my defence that ""My Super Ex-Girlfriend"" was about the best choice on a recent flight. Not that anyone would believe me, anyway.Having already put the in-flight vomit bag in a handy place, (just in case), I braced myself in the recommended position for the disaster that I was expecting in this movie. Even the bag was empty at the end, which came as a bit of a surprise.Basically the plot follows the usual romantic comedy twists and turns, with some added novelties, such as one of the amorous pair having super powers that would enable her to take on Superman and probably come off on top. Those same powers do add some comic elements to the movie, and were pretty much the largest contributor to the funny side of the movie.Luke Wilson plays the main male interest in his usual soft-spoken, normal, almost sappy way. Wilson seems to almost take a cookie cutter to the roles he plays, as they are all remarkably similar people. If you liked Wilson in any other movie he has done, you will probably like him in this one. Uma Thurman makes a good transition to comedy in her over-the-top way, (good preparation for the over-the-top revenge freak was probably had as Poison Ivy opposite the Bat).I laughed through the movie, so I have to confess it was not as bad as I thought it was.

One day she meets Matt Saunders, an everyday sort of a guy who asks her out, and the two start dating. Alas, he worries about her neuroses, and leaves her for his real love, the girl at work played by Anna Faris (Scary Movie 3 and 4, and Brokeback Mountain). This unleashes the neuroses, and now they are all directed at him. Think it's bad dealing with a crazy ex-girlfriend?

Director Ivan Reitman has never been known for subtle or clever humour (Evolution, Kindergarten Cop, Ghostbusters) but knows how to handle high concept.

It's funnier in the first half and winds down as the `excitement' notches up.

1025061,A2VK365XEVCYC8,B000J4QW8Q,One More Option,"[5, 6]","This movie is a fun romp, with light faire, and some pleasantly surprising intelligence.  The teaser poster for this movie shows Uma Thurman (G-Girl) holding her ex-boyfriend, Owen Wilson, upside down by one leg high over the edge of a building.  The poster reads ""If You Love Somebody, Set Them Free.""And the movie suggests that sometimes ""letting go"" of someone you love doesn't mean you drop them, stop communicating with them, or stop caring for them.  This movie suggests that sometimes to set someone free, you help them deal with the things that may be holding them back or making them angry.  And in the end, after G-Girl has saved her boyfriend many times, he maybe finds a way to return the love.There is a very fun and FUNNY soundtrack.  Ranging from ""Oye Como Va"" to ""She F*#kin' Hates Me"" to ""She Drives Me Crazy.""  There is one great song that runs during the end credits, ""Rescue Me"" by Rachel Robinson, that I enjoyed so much that it became iPod-worthy.The movie makes smart plot choices where it could have made dumb ones.  First, in the beginning of the movie, we see that G-Girl is bright, considerate, and very funny.  On the subway, at their first dinner, and their 2nd date - she is clever, self-protective, and charming.  But we learn her history and discover that her constant unselfish work to provide assistance to so many crisis regularly happening around her has taken a toll on her psyche.  Her frustration is amplified because she has not surrounded herself with allies who help her interpret things more positively.  Her neurotic environment does not help her channel potential conflict into humor instead of anger.  G-Girl, without Owen, tends to get very mad and doesn't laugh nearly as much.  It's so important to surround yourself with people who can disable your worries and make you laugh.If you've ever had a super terrific ex-boyfriend or ex-girlfriend who was neurotic with ""anger"" issues, you might know what I mean.  And watching this movie, you may unexpectedly find yourself laughing louder than anyone else in the room.Another key plot choice I liked was the ending.  Owen has realized that G-Girl is not the best match for him.  And after trying other means of ""getting rid of her,"" his final resolution is bright.  He does not become jaded, hateful, or a smart alec.  He doesn't belittle G-Girls gifts and kind intent.  He doesn't coyly say, ""I think we're done here.""  Instead, he shows her the love that has existed toward her from people she perceived as enemies.  And he suggests that reconciliation may be more fun and funny than the other more detached and cold war solutions G-Girl has been relying on.On a related superhero movie note, comic writer Peter David critiqued ""Superman Returns"" saying that Superman wouldn't disappear for 6 years without telling the people who cared about him where he was going or how long he would be gone.  The ""S"" on his chest doesn't stand for ""selfish.""  The ""S"" on Superman, and the ""G"" on G-Girl stand for good.  They stand for being considerate and helpful to others.  They stand for being resilient long after everyone else has given up.  They stand for love.As ""Ex-Girlfriend's"" song ""Resuce Me"" says, ""The only superpower here that makes us strong that kills the fear is love.""",4,The Only Superpower Here Is Love,1155168000,"08 10, 2006",2006,3273,"['movie', 'fun', 'romp', 'light', 'faire', 'pleasantly', 'surprising', 'intelligence', 'teaser', 'poster', 'movie', 'Uma', 'Thurman', 'G-Girl', 'holding', 'ex-boyfriend', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'upside', 'down', 'one', 'leg', 'high', 'edge', 'building', 'poster', 'Love', 'Somebody', 'Set', 'Them', 'Free', 'movie', 'sometimes', 'letting', 'go', 'someone', 'love', ""n't"", 'mean', 'drop', 'stop', 'communicating', 'stop', 'caring', 'movie', 'sometimes', 'set', 'someone', 'free', 'help', 'deal', 'things', 'may', 'be', 'holding', 'back', 'making', 'angry', 'end', 'G-Girl', 'saved', 'boyfriend', 'many', 'times', 'maybe', 'way', 'return', 'love.There', 'very', 'fun', 'FUNNY', 'soundtrack', 'Ranging', 'Oye', 'Como', 'Va', 'F*', 'kin', 'Hates', 'Me', 'Me', 'Crazy', 'one', 'great', 'song', 'end', 'Rescue', 'Me', 'Rachel', 'Robinson', 'enjoyed', 'so', 'much', 'became', 'iPod-worthy.The', 'movie', 'smart', 'plot', 'choices', 'where', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'dumb', 'ones', 'First', 'beginning', 'movie', 'see', 'G-Girl', 'bright', 'considerate', 'very', 'funny', 'subway', 'first', 'dinner', '2nd', 'date', 'clever', 'self-protective', 'charming', 'learn', 'history', 'discover', 'constant', 'unselfish', 'work', 'provide', 'assistance', 'so', 'many', 'crisis', 'regularly', 'happening', 'taken', 'toll', 'psyche', 'frustration', 'amplified', 'not', 'surrounded', 'allies', 'who', 'help', 'interpret', 'things', 'more', 'positively', 'neurotic', 'environment', 'not', 'help', 'channel', 'potential', 'conflict', 'humor', 'instead', 'anger', 'G-Girl', 'Owen', 'get', 'very', 'mad', ""n't"", 'laugh', 'nearly', 'as', 'much', 'so', 'important', 'surround', 'people', 'who', 'can', 'disable', 'worries', 'make', 'laugh.If', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'had', 'super', 'terrific', 'ex-boyfriend', 'ex-girlfriend', 'who', 'was', 'neurotic', 'anger', 'issues', 'might', 'know', 'what', 'mean', 'watching', 'movie', 'may', 'unexpectedly', 'find', 'laughing', 'louder', 'anyone', 'else', 'room.Another', 'key', 'plot', 'choice', 'liked', 'was', 'ending', 'Owen', 'realized', 'G-Girl', 'not', 'best', 'match', 'trying', 'other', 'means', 'getting', 'rid', 'final', 'resolution', 'bright', 'not', 'become', 'jaded', 'hateful', 'smart', 'alec', ""n't"", 'belittle', 'G-Girls', 'gifts', 'kind', 'intent', ""n't"", 'coyly', 'say', 'think', ""'re"", 'done', 'here', 'Instead', 'love', 'existed', 'people', 'perceived', 'enemies', 'reconciliation', 'may', 'be', 'more', 'fun', 'funny', 'other', 'more', 'detached', 'cold', 'war', 'solutions', 'G-Girl', 'been', 'relying', 'related', 'superhero', 'movie', 'note', 'comic', 'writer', 'Peter', 'David', 'critiqued', 'Superman', 'Returns', 'saying', 'Superman', 'would', ""n't"", 'disappear', '6', 'years', 'telling', 'people', 'who', 'cared', 'where', 'was', 'going', 'how', 'long', 'would', 'be', 'gone', 'S', 'chest', ""n't"", 'stand', 'selfish', 'S', 'Superman', 'G', 'G-Girl', 'stand', 'good', 'stand', 'being', 'considerate', 'helpful', 'others', 'stand', 'being', 'resilient', 'long', 'everyone', 'else', 'given', 'up', 'stand', 'love.As', 'Ex-Girlfriend', 'song', 'Resuce', 'Me', 'only', 'superpower', 'here', 'strong', 'fear', 'love']",N/A

1025070,A16QODENBJVUI1,B000J4QW8Q,Robert Moore,"[3, 7]","Despite Uma Thurman, who usually manages to enliven even a weak film, this is a disappointing film with an interesting premise.  Uma plays G-Girl, a super hero who emotionally is needy, clingy, jealous, and petty.  Now, the idea of an emotionally stunted super hero is a great one, but unfortunately the execution is simply not very good.  There are some good individual moments to go along with some amazing bad ones -- for instance, a rather dumb joke involving moving a bed several feet constantly during sex -- but in the end the bad decidedly outweighs the bad. The bad, in fad, outweighs the good by a considerable margin.Part of the problem is that the movie does very little work in trying to establish Jenny Johnson, G-Girl's alter ego, as an interesting character before having her and Luke Wilson's Matt Saunders in a relationship.  Yes, she is physically beautiful, but so obviously neurotic that no guy could or at least should find her attractive.  The film doesn't even do a very good job of establishing Matt as a compelling character.  And if you are among those who find Rainn Wilson's Dwight Schrute an irritating character on THE OFFICE, his role as Matt's buddy won't count as one of the film's attractions.  To top things off, the CGI is simply terrible.  There aren't many scenes where G-Girl looks very convincing in action.  Anyone doubting me should watch SUPERMAN RETURNS and MY SUPER EX-GIRLFRIEND back to back, like I did (an unplanned super double-bill).  The weakest scene may have been one where G-Girl throws a shark through a window at Matt and his girl.  Sharks, of course, out of water for any length of time, are utterly immobile.  Yet this one manages to fling itself around the apartment as if it were a land mammal.Still, the film isn't quite a bad as this could make it sound.  There are some good moments, though not enough of them.  Luke Wilson is always likable, even in a weaker film like this.

I love Uma Thurman and I love Luke Wilson, but apparently they are two great tastes that do not taste great together. I am curious as to what it was about the script that attracted them.Uma Thurman plays Jenny Johnson, a single, lonely artist, and her alter ego -- the super hero G-Girl. Jenny begins dating Matt (Luke Wilson), revealing her alter ego over the course of their relationship, and after her insane, neurotic, girl-jealousy prods him to break up with her, she uses her super powers to make him really, really regret dumping her. There was nothing at all interesting about either character.Luke Wilson's Matt was stereotypical Luke Wilson. An adorable, average sort of guy totally lacking the gentle likability of Legally Blonde's Emmett or the naughty charm of The Family Stone's Ben. Thurman's G-Girl/Jenny was uncharmingly neurotic. She was that girl who wants to be in a relationship, but who really doesn't know how until she meets the guy who shows her how much fun and how easy it is. Only in those kinds of movies they hit a snag and get back together and live happily ever after, she after having been rescued by this pseudo knight in shining armor. In My Super Ex-Girlfriend, the girl turns out to be a crazy super hero with a taste for vengeance.I didn't like that G-Girl was really such a bad guy. Sure she does good deeds and saves lives and all that, but she's incredibly petty. I know that, in part, that's the point -- she's an average person who just happens to have super powers (unlike the ideal caricatured super hero who fights for truth, justice and the American way) -- but what they seem to have done is exchange one caricature (superhero a la Superman) for another (petty, needy and vindictive female).Eddie Izzard takes a turn as the super villain, only he's in love with G-Girl and plagues her because of some mishmashed desire for her and an old high school inspired grudge against her for ignoring him once she became a super hero. Eddie Izzard is adorable no matter what, and he plays Professor Bedlam with tongue suitably planted in cheek, but even he wasn't enough to save this film.The super girl smackdown at the end was boring and trite. I don't find girls fighting over guys even remotely interesting, the fact that they had super powers didn't improve the situation at all.So, yeah, definitely a big fat no.",1,i wish g-girl that thrown a shark AT ME,1222214400,"09 24, 2008",2008,2412,"['Sadly', 'enough', 'was', 'largely', 'unfunny', 'uninteresting', 'love', 'Uma', 'Thurman', 'love', 'Luke', 'Wilson', 'apparently', 'are', 'two', 'great', 'tastes', 'do', 'not', 'taste', 'great', 'together', 'am', 'curious', 'what', 'was', 'script', 'attracted', 'them.Uma', 'Thurman', 'Jenny', 'Johnson', 'single', 'lonely', 'artist', 'alter', 'ego', 'super', 'hero', 'G-Girl', 'Jenny', 'dating', 'Matt', 'Luke', 'Wilson', 'revealing', 'alter', 'ego', 'course', 'relationship', 'insane', 'neurotic', 'girl-jealousy', 'prods', 'break', 'up', 'super', 'powers', 'make', 'really', 'really', 'regret', 'dumping', 'was', 'nothing', 'interesting', 'character.Luke', 'Wilson', 'Matt', 'was', 'stereotypical', 'Luke', 'Wilson', 'adorable', 'average', 'sort', 'guy', 'totally', 'lacking', 'gentle', 'likability', 'Legally', 'Blonde', 'Emmett', 'naughty', 'charm', 'Family', 'Stone', 'Ben', 'Thurman', 'G-Girl/Jenny', 'was', 'uncharmingly', 'neurotic', 'was', 'girl', 'who', 'be', 'relationship', 'who', 'really', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'guy', 'who', 'how', 'much', 'fun', 'how', 'easy', 'Only', 'kinds', 'movies', 'hit', 'snag', 'get', 'back', 'together', 'live', 'happily', 'ever', 'having', 'been', 'rescued', 'pseudo', 'knight', 'shining', 'armor', 'My', 'Super', 'Ex-Girlfriend', 'girl', 'out', 'be', 'crazy', 'super', 'hero', 'taste', 'vengeance.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'G-Girl', 'was', 'really', 'such', 'bad', 'guy', 'Sure', 'good', 'deeds', 'lives', 'incredibly', 'petty', 'know', 'part', 'point', 'average', 'person', 'who', 'just', 'have', 'super', 'powers', 'ideal', 'caricatured', 'super', 'hero', 'who', 'truth', 'justice', 'American', 'way', 'what', 'seem', 'have', 'done', 'exchange', 'one', 'caricature', 'superhero', 'la', 'Superman', 'petty', 'needy', 'vindictive', 'female', 'Izzard', 'turn', 'super', 'villain', 'only', 'love', 'G-Girl', 'because', 'mishmashed', 'desire', 'old', 'high', 'school', 'inspired', 'grudge', 'ignoring', 'once', 'became', 'super', 'hero', 'Eddie', 'Izzard', 'adorable', 'matter', 'what', 'Professor', 'Bedlam', 'tongue', 'suitably', 'planted', 'cheek', 'even', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'save', 'film.The', 'super', 'girl', 'smackdown', 'end', 'was', 'boring', 'trite', 'do', ""n't"", 'find', 'girls', 'fighting', 'guys', 'even', 'remotely', 'interesting', 'fact', 'had', 'super', 'powers', 'did', ""n't"", 'improve', 'situation', 'all.So', 'yeah', 'definitely', 'big', 'fat']",N/A

1025080,A29BQ6B90Y1R5F,B000J4QW8Q,S. Rhodes,"[2, 4]","Upon my first look at My Super Ex-Girlfriend, the premise really seemed interesting...  The movie is not a spoof of your average superhero movie, but it's not a movie that was really suited for the theater in some ways.  The movie is neither bad nor good.  There are some moments when you'll laugh, but these moments are often few and far between.The city of New York has a protector.  Her name is G-Girl (Uma Thurman).  When not saving the world she is your average girl by the name of Jenny Johnson.  At least she tries to be average.  While on the subway one day, Jenny is approached by a man named Matt Saunders (Luke Wilson) who is interested in asking her out.  Shortly after she rejects him, a man steals her purse and he gives chase to get it back for her.  When Jenny sees that Matt isn't such a bad guy afterall, she agrees to date him.  At first things seem just peachy between them.  Until Matt discovers that he may not be in love with Jenny/G-Girl after all.  Instead he may be in love with a fellow co-worker named Hannah (played by Anna Faris).  So what does he do?  Dumps Jenny/G-Girl.  Matt is about to learn that you don't dump a superhero.  Especially one that once portrayed The Bride in Kill Bill.  G-Girl decides to make Matt's life a living hell.The movie from that point on becomes one revenge ploy after another, including a scene in which she throws a shark into Matt's apartment.  That's the big laugh out loud moment in the entire flick, however.  The other moments are really worth just a chuckle or a giggle.It does, at least, manage to poke fun at the Superhero genre in general.  The main antagonist happens to be an evil genius professor (surprise, surprise) who has found a way to rob G-Girl of her powers.  Except he's made it into a business, more or less (villiany has to be a business when you've got business cards and a website).The entire plot in the end however, turns into one cliche after another.  From learning how G-Girl got her powers to why our villians wants to rob her of them.  Even though this is by no means meant to be a superhero movie, it certainly acts like one at some parts.  Our main protagonists, Matt, is even talked into this evil plot.  The movie quickly becomes tiring and predictable outside of G-Girl's tactics to make Matt's life a living hell.Even worse, when it comes to the moments when G-Girl has to save New York from such dangerous disasters like a missle hurdling towards New York (without any explanation as to where it came from or who launched it, mind you), they seem like they're just thrown in for good measure.  As in, we have to know what G-Girl can do.  What?  Seeing her use her powers to exact revenge on Matt isn't enough?  These moments when she ""saves"" New York feel like space fillers than actual development of the story.My Super Ex-Girlfriend has it's moments, however.  They're few and far between, but they at least come.  It's not worth seeing in the theater.

For the most part, I found this film to be rather tiresome and boring.  The jokes were rather lame, ill-conceived, and forced.  Some may love this kind of thing for whatever reason I won't pretend to understand, but I just didn't get it.  It was certainly a clever concept and even well cast, but it was poorly executed.The only bright spots in this film were Uma Thurman, who is always fun to watch with her exotic looks and quirky acting style, and Rainn Wilson from American TV's ""The Office"" fame who steals every scene he's in.  Anna Faris is pretty to look at, but not much else, and Luke Wilson is generally appealing in this role, but several other actors could have done this role better (Ben Stiller or Steven Carell).I also found the marketing of this film to be in poor taste.  It came on as a coming attraction during a kid's film I had taken my family to see and although PG-13 rated, it looked like something we could all enjoy.  My kids are 10 and 14, so I realize this wasn't a Disneyesque-like film, but with effects and a superhero (who had played a villain in a Batman movie), I thought it might be okay for all of us.  My kids are rather mature for their ages anyhow.  None of the coming attractions indicated anything overtly sexual; it just looked like a funny superhero with issues kind of film (which it is, but more).  I'm glad I read the reasons behind the PG-13 rating and ended up NOT taking my kids as there was toilet humor and quite a bit of sexual stuff.  I'm no prude here and I actually found a number of these scenes funny, but it didn't belong in a film that appeared to be marketed to older kids and parents.",2,My Super Isn't So Super,1167955200,"01 5, 2007",2007,1732,"['wish', 'could', 'explain', 'found', 'wrong', 'film', 'could', 'take', 'awhile', 'most', 'part', 'found', 'film', 'be', 'rather', 'tiresome', 'boring', 'jokes', 'were', 'rather', 'lame', 'ill-conceived', 'forced', 'may', 'love', 'kind', 'thing', 'reason', 'wo', ""n't"", 'pretend', 'understand', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'was', 'certainly', 'clever', 'concept', 'even', 'well', 'cast', 'was', 'poorly', 'executed.The', 'only', 'bright', 'spots', 'film', 'were', 'Uma', 'Thurman', 'who', 'always', 'fun', 'watch', 'exotic', 'looks', 'quirky', 'acting', 'style', 'Rainn', 'Wilson', 'American', 'TV', 'Office', 'fame', 'who', 'scene', 'Anna', 'Faris', 'pretty', 'look', 'not', 'much', 'else', 'Luke', 'Wilson', 'generally', 'appealing', 'role', 'several', 'other', 'actors', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'role', 'better', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'Steven', 'Carell', '.I', 'also', 'found', 'marketing', 'film', 'be', 'poor', 'taste', 'came', 'coming', 'attraction', 'kid', 'film', 'had', 'taken', 'family', 'see', 'PG-13', 'rated', 'looked', 'something', 'could', 'enjoy', 'kids', 'are', '10', '14', 'so', 'realize', 'was', ""n't"", 'Disneyesque-like', 'film', 'effects', 'superhero', 'who', 'had', 'played', 'villain', 'Batman', 'movie', 'thought', 'might', 'be', 'okay', 'kids', 'are', 'rather', 'mature', 'ages', 'anyhow', 'None', 'coming', 'attractions', 'indicated', 'anything', 'overtly', 'sexual', 'just', 'looked', 'funny', 'superhero', 'issues', 'kind', 'film', 'more', ""'m"", 'glad', 'read', 'reasons', 'PG-13', 'rating', 'ended', 'up', 'NOT', 'taking', 'kids', 'was', 'toilet', 'humor', 'quite', 'bit', 'sexual', 'stuff', ""'m"", 'prude', 'here', 'actually', 'found', 'number', 'scenes', 'funny', 'did', ""n't"", 'belong', 'film', 'appeared', 'be', 'marketed', 'older', 'kids', 'parents']",N/A

1025085,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B000J4QW8Q,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[2, 4]","When I first saw the trailer for ""My Super Ex-Girlfriend"", starring Uma Thurman and Luke Wilson, I was pretty sure the film would be a stinker. Yet another example of the preview revealing any and all good jokes.But I went anyway, purchasing my bargain matinee ticket. Why? For you, devoted reader. For you.I was surprised to find a fairly large crowd in the theater.I was more surprised to find myself laughing.Jenny Johnson (Uma Thurman), assistant curator at an art gallery, is also superhero G-Girl. Rushing off to put out a fire, or to stop a jewelry store robbery, she tries to lead a normal life through her alter ego. One day, she meets Matt Saunders (Luke Wilson), an architect who is taking the break-up with his ex-girlfriend badly. Vaughn (Rainn Wilson, TV's ""The Office"") urges him to get back into the game and introduce himself to a pretty woman they spot on the subway. Initially, Jenny isn't interested, but she soon relents. Although Matt enjoys the intensity of the relationship, Jenny soon proves to be a bit of a psycho and he breaks it off with her because he finds himself attracted to Hanna (Anna Faris, ""Scary Movie"", ""Just Friends""), a co-worker in his office. As soon as Jenny gets wind of the new relationship, she begins to make things very difficult leading Matt to seek help from G-Girl's nemesis, Professor Bedlam (Eddie Izzard).""My Super Ex-Girlfriend"", directed by Ivan Reitman (""Ghostbusters"", ""Dave"") is a very funny film. It is difficult to make a good comedy, as anyone who has made the mistake of watching ""You, Me and Dupree"" can testify. It is even more difficult to make a great comedy. ""Wedding Crashers"", good. ""40 Year Old Virgin"", great. Good comedies make you laugh for a while and then fall victim to the story; they have to resolve the story they have set-up, so the laughs falter a bit. Great comedies make you laugh for a long time, consistently throughout the film. ""Ex-Girlfriend"" is really funny for about an hour and then the story kicks in and the laughs become more infrequent.A lot of the humor in ""Ex-Girlfriend"" is derived from the relationship between Jenny/ G-Girl and Matt. On the one hand, Matt is a little turned on by Jenny's forceful nature. He is even more turned on when she reveals she is the super hero. But because we spend a lot of time with Matt and his co-worker Vaughn, as they discuss dating, women and other aspects of being single, these moments take on a more heightened aspect. Vaughn is a pig and has very primitive views on dating, providing a nice counterpoint to Matt's more acceptable character. Yet, Matt is still a guy, so he listens to Vaughn and becomes excited when Jenny takes control of the situation.There is a truly hilarious scene during the second date between the two. But to describe it would ruin the impact. I won't do that.Then, as the relationship turns sour, much of the laughs are derived from the normal situations which arise from any failed relationship. The girlfriend is too clingy, reading more into every gesture. The boyfriend likes certain aspects of the relationship, but doesn't really love her. Now, imagine the ex-girlfriend is a super hero who can bend butcher's knives, throw killer sharks through apartment windows and throw your car into orbit and you begin to get an idea of the unusual nature of their relationship.During one of their dates, Jenny explains the origins of G-Girl to Matt. During high school, she and her best friend, Barry, the two nerds in the school, are out on a first date, after being friends for years, when a meteor hit. Jenny reaches out to touch it just as it explodes sending powers throughout Jenny's body. Changing her, the powers also make her braces disappear and her breasts get bigger, making her suddenly very popular in school, leaving her best friend, Barry, to while away the rest of his years alone. As an adult, Barry (Eddie Izzard), takes on the super villain mantra of Professor Bedlam and becomes obsessed with taking G-Girl's powers.There are a lot of nice touches throughout ""Ex-Girlfriend"". Uma Thurman is very funny dealing with the pressures of being a superhero as she tries to maintain her relationship with Matt. I think it would be difficult for anyone to unexpectedly leave a date to have to deal with a major crisis. In one scene, Jenny doesn't want to leave Matt alone with Hannah even as a runaway missile bears down on New York City. Matt gives her a few nudges, trying to get her to transform into G-Girl and save the city. Finally, she reluctantly agrees, sulking off to become G-Girl and save the city. When she becomes the jilted ex, her anger provides a lot of amusing situations.Luke Wilson is also very good as nice guy Matt. Yet, because he is a guy, he isn't beyond thinking about Jenny in a typical guy fashion; he is turned on when she takes charge in bed, he likes that his girlfriend is a super hero.Rainn Wilson is very funny as the co-worker who always disgusts any woman he comes in contact with. There are many funny bits showing him trying to pick up other women. One bartender tells him repeatedly ""Don't ever talk to me again.""As Professor Bedlam, Eddie Izzard is also very amusing. He brings a very understated quality to the performance. Naturally, a bad guy is going to have a diabolical plan, but the plan is rooted in very human feelings; he doesn't want to blow up the world, he merely wants to get even with the girl who jilted him in high school.Throughout, there are little visual touches which add a lot to the humor. When Bedlam first abducts Matt, his bodyguard constantly slaps Matt in the face, provoking irritation more than anything. When Bedlam reveals the secret of his plan, the item is stored in a refrigerator in his study, sitting next to a ham; a take out menu affixed to the front with a magnet proudly proclaims a lunch special for $4.25.A lot of the humor is also based on sex and relationships. Because this was unexpected, it provides another level top the film, taking it beyond the normal pre-fab studio comedy. Matt and Vaughn talk about sex and relationships, causing us to laugh at Vaughn's warped views and Matt's eagerness to listen. As Jenny and Matt begin their relationship, we laugh at their reactions to one another. When Matt breaks-up with her, his attempts to start a new relationship with Hannah while realizing she might be in danger, and need protection, provide yet another level of humor. All of this is funny because it is based in reality. Yes, the events are exaggerated, but we have all experienced something similar. The fact that one of the characters is a superhero adds a nice wrinkle to the mix.But the film slows down a bit as the story mechanics start to take hold. After the initial delight with all of the unusual characters and their relationships, the jokes slow down as the writer begins to walks the various people through the story, to get to the inevitable climax. This is fairly predictable; most comedies run into this problem, so it isn't a major drawback. As this happens, there are some amusing jokes and laughs, but they just aren't as consistent. It is hard not to notice such a thing when you have been laughing consistently for an hour and all of a sudden, you're watching a story develop. Great comedies maintain the laughter throughout.""My Super Ex-Girlfriend"" was a surprise. It is the rare comedy which doesn't show everything in the trailers, providing a lot of laughs, a unique idea and interesting execution.I was surprised.

1025088,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B000J4QW8Q,Tsuyoshi,"[2, 3]","The only moral of ""My Super Ex-Girlfriend"" is, once you start dating with a Supergirl, you cannot leave her without making your life very miserable. No breaking-up is possible for she will return to you, and literally wreck your life by doing whatever she can do, like throwing a live shark into your new girlfriend's room. The premise of Ivan Reitman's new comedy ""My Super Ex-Girlfriend"" is so silly (with so much sexual nuance) that it may either hugely entertain you or utterly irritates you.I happened to love this film because of its silliness and its cast including gorgeous Uma Thurman as the titular ""Super Ex-Girlfriend,"" usually referred to as ""G-Girl"" in this film. Luke Wilson plays a nice, slightly timid businessman Matt, whose new girlfriend is the Supergirl. At first he thinks he is the luckiest guy in the world. Later he learns that G-Girl has another side of her characters, very manipulative and mentally unstable.The main cast of Uma Thurman and Luke Wilson deliver the goods, giving us some hilarious moments with credible characters. Supports include Anna Faris as Hannah, Matt's co-worker, an underwritten character who could be much more interesting with Ms. Faris's considerable comic talent, and always reliable Eddie Izzard as Professor Bedlum, nerdy Super-Villain, who is funny to see with his deadpan humor.The film is given a clever twist on the Superhero/heroin theme, but probably other directors might have exploited the theme more and parodied the romantic comedy or super heroine genre thoroughly. You might spot some scenes where you would feel ""This should be funnier with a different approach"" and perhaps you're right. This might not be the best comedy of the year, but it is funny all the same, and Uma Thurman's fantastic performance as Super Ex-Girlfriend should not be missed.",4,"Uma Thurman Is My Super Ex-Girlfiend: A Bit Slack, But Funny and Sexy",1171152000,"02 11, 2007",2007,1822,"['only', 'moral', 'Super', 'Ex-Girlfriend', 'once', 'start', 'dating', 'Supergirl', 'can', 'not', 'leave', 'making', 'life', 'very', 'miserable', 'breaking-up', 'possible', 'will', 'return', 'literally', 'wreck', 'life', 'doing', 'can', 'do', 'like', 'throwing', 'live', 'shark', 'new', 'girlfriend', 'room', 'premise', 'Ivan', 'Reitman', 'new', 'comedy', 'Super', 'Ex-Girlfriend', 'so', 'silly', 'so', 'much', 'sexual', 'nuance', 'may', 'either', 'hugely', 'entertain', 'utterly', 'irritates', 'you.I', 'happened', 'love', 'film', 'silliness', 'cast', 'including', 'gorgeous', 'Uma', 'Thurman', 'titular', 'Super', 'Ex-Girlfriend', 'usually', 'referred', 'G-Girl', 'film', 'Luke', 'Wilson', 'nice', 'slightly', 'timid', 'businessman', 'Matt', 'new', 'girlfriend', 'Supergirl', 'first', 'luckiest', 'guy', 'world', 'Later', 'G-Girl', 'side', 'characters', 'very', 'manipulative', 'mentally', 'unstable.The', 'main', 'cast', 'Uma', 'Thurman', 'Luke', 'Wilson', 'deliver', 'goods', 'giving', 'hilarious', 'moments', 'credible', 'characters', 'Supports', 'include', 'Anna', 'Faris', 'Hannah', 'Matt', 'co-worker', 'underwritten', 'character', 'who', 'could', 'be', 'much', 'more', 'interesting', 'Ms.', 'Faris', 'considerable', 'comic', 'talent', 'always', 'reliable', 'Eddie', 'Izzard', 'Professor', 'Bedlum', 'nerdy', 'Super-Villain', 'who', 'funny', 'see', 'deadpan', 'humor.The', 'film', 'given', 'clever', 'twist', 'Superhero/heroin', 'theme', 'probably', 'other', 'directors', 'might', 'have', 'exploited', 'theme', 'more', 'parodied', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'super', 'heroine', 'genre', 'thoroughly', 'might', 'spot', 'scenes', 'where', 'would', 'feel', 'should', 'be', 'funnier', 'different', 'approach', 'perhaps', ""'re"", 'right', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'best', 'comedy', 'year', 'funny', 'same', 'Uma', 'Thurman', 'fantastic', 'performance', 'Super', 'Ex-Girlfriend', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'missed']",N/A

It's G-Girl super-hero with, as near as I can tell, an endorsement contract with Victoria's Secret. Mild-mannered art history major by day ---- it's been a long time since she's been on a date. In fact, that whole super-thing hit her suddenly in high school, sort of like all the worst of puberty compressed into one afternoon. It left her just a bit, well, needy. Super-needy, so the first guy that takes her out to dinner finds her clinging like a bad case of the barnacles. When this poor un-super slob tries to scrape her off, all that stuff about ""a woman scorned"" gets rewritten with ""a super-woman scorned."" In absolute desperation, he's driven into an unholy alliance with the arch-villain Professor Bedlam, and his evil plan to drain her of her powers with ... Well, with something, and calling it Kryptonite would be a trademark infringement.But, just as Superman always got over his case of the Kryptonite(TM), G-Girl gets all better, too. And, since this is your basic, everyday kind of light, romantic, super-hero-girl comedy, everyone gets a nice smoochy ending. Then, when G-Girl goes off to save the next pack of ninnies who need saving, Mr. Super is left holding her purse.If you are threatened by the evil shadow of a boring evening, My Super Ex-Girlfriend will bring it to justice.

It made me question, are superheros lonely becuause they are busy all the time saving the world, or are they lonely because they have personality flaws and are crazy?  Well, its something most people don't ever think about.  Luke wilson plays a man that happens to start dating a girl he met on the subway saving her purse from a mugger. Little does he know what is in store for him...he's dating G-girl (uma thurman), a super hero.  Well, as with many early relationships, this one just is not working out...she's a bit needy/possessive and he's in love with someone else, but how do you break it off with a superwoman.  Well, this movie will answer that question, and its actually has some funny moments.  Yes, its not an acadamy award winner, but its entertaining.
