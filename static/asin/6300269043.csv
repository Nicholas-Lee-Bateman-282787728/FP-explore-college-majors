233456,A3TNM3C9ENUCFW,6300269043,"A.M.Boughey ""Poetmaster""","[7, 7]","Some 16 years before the Oscar laden and equally brilliant &quot;Unforgiven&quot;, this movie is seen by many as one of Clint Eastwoods finest movies, particularly in the Western genre. Playing the title role himself, we meet Josey Wales, a quiet farmer, abruptly thrown into the civil war after his land and family are attacked by Union soldiers,  who joins up with the confederate fight in an almost guerilla / mercenary way. The civil War aspect of the story is little more than an opening skirmish however, as it is the subsequent fugitive aspect of the character that moves us through most of the picture. I have to disagree with those that think this is just a revenge movie, or that a single viewing is all one can manage, as the story unfolds in a multi faceted way with each succesive viewing, despite the viewer knowing the ending. Wales comes to be the guiding scout and protector to an unlikely and very mixed bag of characters (all played with sound realism)as he is continually and almost reluctantly hounded by his former ally Fletcher. Charged with hunting him down, Fletcher (played with a salty almost poetic grace by John Vernon) must accompany a band of &quot;red leg&quot; Union soldiers, with more than questionable morality, to the border and this long pursuit helps the picture move at an even pace. Add some interesting subplots, commancheros, some imaginative and lively characters (with many of Eastwoods regular screen stars in various roles)and the overall effect is just right, without trying to be moralistic. Often brutal in it's depiction of the &quot;wild&quot; west, and at times graphically violent keeps the deserved R rating, but some moments of comedy and pathos bring an unmistakable Eastwood handprint of direction, without overtaking the excellent story or script. Already widely received as a classic piece of filmaking, it has stood the test of time extremely well, and has become one of the movies that have benchmarked the genre since it's release almost thirty years ago.

Nathaniel Wallace, Jr. ""Nosidino""","[0, 0]","Despite this movie having come from the book written by the warped mind of Asa Carter, the KKK supporter, I truly enjoyed this movie. Eastwood plays a peaceful man driven to war by the murder of his family by Red Leg Union soldiers.Missouri was a boundary state in American Civil War. Men like the Earp brothers went to fight for the Union while men like Josey Wales went to fight for the Confederacy. Yet Wales was no slave-owner. He was a peaceful man and would probably have remained neutral had it not been for the murder of his family. But did the Red Legs make the biggest mistake of their lives! Wales showed no mercy to them and ended up slaughtering them all.But while Wales might slaughter his enemies (See What He Did To The Hapless Commancheros) Wales was also a negotiator. He was able to negotiate a fair accord with the Comanche chief that enabled the family of Sondra Locke to live on their land in peace. That was very shrewd of Josey Wales.I don't have the DVD but I recently saw this on a tape I made from cable 20 years ago. I highly recommend this movie. See it for the Colt 1849 pocket and 1860 army revolvers used ubiquitously in this film! If you are a gun enthusiast you will like this film.

This film is just filled with too many cliches and some slightly bad acting. The plot wasn't all that wonderful and interesting. I just wished Clint Eastwood could have used the style from Sudden Impact and A Fistful of Dollars and incorporated them into a Western film starring himself, but I don't think it had happened at all.

Scribe ""trekviewer""","[4, 4]","At a time when doing a Western was a definite financial misstep for a movie studio, Eastwood took on this unique project believing in it's potential for success.  Westerns had become increasingly cardboard and clich&eacute; ridden by the mid-seventies and Eastwood single-handedly pumped new life into that tired genre with this inspired treatment of a rare and then unknown novel.  As a result the character of Josey Wales is now etched into the folklore of Western films along with many other luminary figures of the silver screen.  Not only did the film do well at the box office it also gathered a great amount of critical praise and has since received the distinction of being selected to the National Film Registry.  Though it only received a lone Academy Award nomination for its music score 'The Outlaw Josey Wales' has won infinite admiration of generations of film fans since its release in 1976.During the early months of the Civil War simple and carefree Missouri farmer Wales' wife and son are slaughtered and himself left for dead by a renegade gang known as the Red Legs.  Josey happens to meet a band of Southerners seeking vengeance against that group and quite naturally joins them.  Over four years pass and the Southerners' leader announces that he has worked out a truce with the Union for their peaceful surrender.  Rather than continue fighting the men agree to the truce and are double-crossed by the Union; Wales had decided against surrender, preferring to pursue the vengeance he still felt he was owed.  Seeing the double-cross the men are caught in he takes action, resulting in the deaths of many Union soldiers - which leads to an unjust bounty being placed on his head.  Wales begins his run from the still bloodthirsty Union marauders and along the way has to do battle with a variety of Westerners who want to collect the reward for bringing him in.  He also rediscovers the man he was meant to be, meeting homeless Indians and hopeful Texas settlers, acquiring a family of sorts.Based on the book &quot;Gone To Texas&quot; by Forrest Carter, who claimed to be half-Cherokee, 'The Outlaw Josey Wales' ranks among the best films in the Western canon.  Director Eastwood keeps the movie both unromanticized and unglamorous, maintaining authentic period flavor and portraying the Native Americans with all too rare compassion and sensitivity.  The inclusion of anti-sentiment between the North and the South after the Civil War adds immeasurably to the effectiveness of the story.  The lead character is brought to vibrant life by the capable and superlative Eastwood who perfectly conveys the different states of conflict Wales goes through, reticent to change but proving vulnerable to the best qualities in people.  The rest of the cast is equally superior in bringing conviction to their roles as well, with Chief Dan George as Lone Watie a standout and Paula Trueman as Grandma Sarah most memorable.  Along with 'A Fistful Of Dollars' and 'Unforgiven', 'The Outlaw Josey Wales' stands as the best of Eastwood's Westerns - with a nod to 'Pale Rider'.The only major misstep: the name-dropping of &quot;Bloody Bill&quot; Anderson who is never dealt with beyond the introduction he supplies to Wales near the beginning.  While he is a genuine historical figure the mentioning of him is completely unnecessary and seems to be added to give the impression that Josey Wales is as &quot;factual&quot;.",4,Distinguished epic western that revitalized the genre,1039392000,"12 9, 2002",2002,3429,"['time', 'when', 'doing', 'Western', 'was', 'definite', 'financial', 'misstep', 'movie', 'studio', 'Eastwood', 'took', 'unique', 'project', 'believing', 'potential', 'success', 'Westerns', 'had', 'become', 'increasingly', 'cardboard', 'clich', 'eacute', 'ridden', 'mid-seventies', 'Eastwood', 'single-handedly', 'pumped', 'new', 'life', 'tired', 'genre', 'inspired', 'treatment', 'rare', 'then', 'unknown', 'novel', 'result', 'character', 'Josey', 'Wales', 'now', 'etched', 'folklore', 'Western', 'films', 'many', 'other', 'luminary', 'figures', 'silver', 'screen', 'Not', 'only', 'did', 'film', 'do', 'well', 'box', 'office', 'also', 'gathered', 'great', 'amount', 'critical', 'praise', 'received', 'distinction', 'being', 'selected', 'National', 'Film', 'Registry', 'only', 'received', 'lone', 'Academy', 'Award', 'nomination', 'music', 'score', 'Outlaw', 'Josey', 'Wales', 'won', 'infinite', 'admiration', 'generations', 'film', 'fans', 'release', '1976.During', 'early', 'months', 'Civil', 'War', 'simple', 'carefree', 'Missouri', 'farmer', 'Wales', 'wife', 'son', 'are', 'slaughtered', 'left', 'dead', 'renegade', 'gang', 'known', 'Red', 'Legs', 'Josey', 'meet', 'band', 'Southerners', 'seeking', 'vengeance', 'group', 'quite', 'naturally', 'four', 'years', 'pass', 'Southerners', 'leader', 'announces', 'worked', 'out', 'truce', 'Union', 'peaceful', 'surrender', 'Rather', 'continue', 'fighting', 'men', 'agree', 'truce', 'are', 'double-crossed', 'Union', 'Wales', 'had', 'decided', 'surrender', 'preferring', 'pursue', 'vengeance', 'still', 'felt', 'was', 'owed', 'Seeing', 'double-cross', 'men', 'are', 'caught', 'action', 'resulting', 'deaths', 'many', 'Union', 'soldiers', 'unjust', 'bounty', 'being', 'placed', 'head', 'run', 'still', 'bloodthirsty', 'Union', 'marauders', 'way', 'do', 'battle', 'variety', 'Westerners', 'who', 'want', 'collect', 'reward', 'bringing', 'also', 'man', 'was', 'meant', 'be', 'meeting', 'homeless', 'Indians', 'hopeful', 'Texas', 'settlers', 'acquiring', 'family', 'sorts.Based', 'book', 'quot', 'Gone', 'Texas', 'quot', 'Forrest', 'Carter', 'who', 'claimed', 'be', 'half-Cherokee', ""'The"", 'Outlaw', 'Josey', 'Wales', 'ranks', 'best', 'films', 'Western', 'canon', 'Director', 'Eastwood', 'movie', 'unromanticized', 'unglamorous', 'maintaining', 'authentic', 'period', 'flavor', 'portraying', 'Native', 'Americans', 'too', 'rare', 'compassion', 'sensitivity', 'inclusion', 'anti-sentiment', 'North', 'South', 'Civil', 'War', 'immeasurably', 'effectiveness', 'story', 'lead', 'character', 'brought', 'vibrant', 'life', 'capable', 'superlative', 'Eastwood', 'who', 'perfectly', 'conveys', 'different', 'states', 'conflict', 'Wales', 'reticent', 'change', 'proving', 'vulnerable', 'best', 'qualities', 'people', 'rest', 'cast', 'equally', 'superior', 'bringing', 'conviction', 'roles', 'as', 'well', 'Chief', 'Dan', 'George', 'Lone', 'Watie', 'standout', 'Paula', 'Trueman', 'Grandma', 'Sarah', 'most', 'memorable', 'Fistful', 'Dollars', ""'Unforgiven"", 'Outlaw', 'Josey', 'Wales', 'stands', 'best', 'Eastwood', 'Westerns', 'nod', ""'Pale"", ""Rider'.The"", 'only', 'major', 'misstep', 'name-dropping', 'quot', 'Bloody', 'Bill', 'quot', 'Anderson', 'who', 'never', 'dealt', 'introduction', 'Wales', 'beginning', 'genuine', 'historical', 'figure', 'mentioning', 'completely', 'unnecessary', 'be', 'added', 'give', 'impression', 'Josey', 'Wales', 'quot', 'factual', 'quot']",N/A

He joins up with a Southern guerrilla unit and fights in the Civil War. He refuses to surrender at the end of the war, however, and heads west with a large band of Union soldiers and bounty hunters on his tail. Along the way he picks up a small group of travellers, including an old Indian chief (played by Chief Dan George, who steals the picture), a squaw, and a widow and her family. (The connection - and symbolism- of these people is obvious.) Wales has the chance to kill about a thousand men by the time they reach Texas. What's the point of all this? Eastwood, because he's enraptured with the ""silent hero"" myth, never reveals an answer. Is it just revenge for what happened to his family? Is he just trying to escape into his own world? Eastwood has always been fascinated with the idea of the hero stepping out of the workings (often perceived as being unfair and nasty) of the real world into a world of his own making (perceived as being ""corrective"" and brutal), which often appears to be jumping out of the frying pan and into the fire.

Fairbanks""","[1, 1]","In recent years, Clint Eastwood's &quot;The Outlaw Josey Wales&quot; has been elevated to a higher plain than it occupied when released in summer 1976. Praised by a handful of critics, the film did well at the box-office but really acquired a following through no less than six highly rated airings on NBC, ABC, and CBS. Now it's often considered Eastwood's finest hour as director and star, even surpassing his Oscar winning &quot;Unforgiven&quot; in some eyes. Among its fans was the late Orson Welles who praised it as one of the finest Westerns ever made, and praised Eastwood as a director worthy of notice long before it was fashionable to do so. In 1996, Eastwood's fifth film as a director was even recognized by the Library of Congress when it was added to the National Film Registry, that collection of films deemed historically, artistically, and/or sociologically important and deserving of protection from tampering by anyone but the original director.At first glance, I found it overlong and meandering, enlivened only occasionally by some trademark Eastwood gunplay. But if it's a little short on the action for which Eastwood made his name, repeated viewings make it clear that there is much more happening beneath the surface. The Outlaw Josey Wales is very much a film about community and trying to find a place in one. Josey Wales is an outlaw only because he avenged the death of his family at the hands of murderous Union soldiers. Now a hunted man, this peaceful farmer is an Angel of Death wandering the west in search of vengeance but also a place to call home. Its scope is much bigger than the revenge tale at its center, and the film represents an important step in Eastwood's maturation as a director.Beautifully photographed, splendidly acted (especially by John Vernon), and capably directed, &quot;The Outlaw Josey Wales&quot; is one of Eastwood's finest hours (although &quot;Unforgiven&quot; is superior in my book), and one of the finest hours for the western, as well.",5,"Classic Eastwood, Classic Western, Classic Movie",1067644800,"11 1, 2003",2003,2003,"['recent', 'years', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'quot', 'Outlaw', 'Josey', 'Wales', 'quot', 'been', 'elevated', 'higher', 'plain', 'occupied', 'when', 'released', 'summer', '1976', 'Praised', 'handful', 'critics', 'film', 'did', 'well', 'box-office', 'really', 'acquired', 'following', 'less', 'six', 'highly', 'rated', 'airings', 'NBC', 'ABC', 'CBS', 'Now', 'often', 'considered', 'Eastwood', 'finest', 'hour', 'director', 'star', 'even', 'surpassing', 'Oscar', 'winning', 'quot', 'Unforgiven', 'quot', 'eyes', 'fans', 'was', 'late', 'Orson', 'Welles', 'who', 'praised', 'one', 'finest', 'Westerns', 'ever', 'made', 'praised', 'Eastwood', 'director', 'worthy', 'notice', 'long', 'was', 'fashionable', 'do', 'so', '1996', 'Eastwood', 'fifth', 'film', 'director', 'was', 'even', 'recognized', 'Library', 'Congress', 'when', 'was', 'added', 'National', 'Film', 'Registry', 'collection', 'films', 'deemed', 'historically', 'artistically', 'sociologically', 'important', 'deserving', 'protection', 'tampering', 'anyone', 'original', 'director.At', 'first', 'glance', 'found', 'overlong', 'meandering', 'enlivened', 'only', 'occasionally', 'trademark', 'Eastwood', 'gunplay', 'little', 'short', 'action', 'Eastwood', 'made', 'name', 'repeated', 'viewings', 'make', 'clear', 'much', 'more', 'happening', 'surface', 'Outlaw', 'Josey', 'Wales', 'very', 'much', 'film', 'community', 'trying', 'find', 'place', 'one', 'Josey', 'Wales', 'outlaw', 'only', 'avenged', 'death', 'family', 'hands', 'murderous', 'Union', 'soldiers', 'Now', 'hunted', 'man', 'peaceful', 'farmer', 'Angel', 'Death', 'wandering', 'west', 'search', 'vengeance', 'also', 'place', 'call', 'home', 'scope', 'much', 'bigger', 'revenge', 'tale', 'center', 'film', 'important', 'step', 'Eastwood', 'maturation', 'director.Beautifully', 'photographed', 'splendidly', 'acted', 'especially', 'John', 'Vernon', 'capably', 'directed', 'quot', 'Outlaw', 'Josey', 'Wales', 'quot', 'one', 'Eastwood', 'finest', 'hours', 'quot', 'Unforgiven', 'quot', 'superior', 'book', 'one', 'finest', 'hours', 'western', 'as', 'well']",N/A

His spaghetti westerns changed the way Westerns where made, and his one liners in his police movies where imitated by many but never surpassed. This to me is his best movie, not just because of his excellent acting, but the great supporting cast, sets, and music. It really gives you a feel for what it was like after the Civil War for those struggling to survive the transition from a country torn apart to uniting and making a community in the old West. No matter if you enjoy westerns or not you will probably enjoy this film. It strikes me as being more like Jeremiah Johnson style than the other Westerns he made. It paints a much broader picture of life and has good character development. Even though I had it on VHS I couldn't wait to get it on DVD.I have been a huge fan of most of Clint Eastwood's movies, except those with Sandra Locke. In this particular movie, even she does a fine job. This is probably the best Western Eastwood has ever done, including ""Unforgiven"". I loved the Spaghetti Westerns, but this takes that hard ghostlike man and makes him human and the other characterizations of the Native American and the townspeople is so relistic you will find yourself immeresed and empathetic to their plight. I think Eastwood directing this made it the film it is today, afterall he had come of age in Westerns from ""Rawhide"" to ""High Plains Drifter"", and he truly understood how to make the people of that period come to life.

There is a ton of pseudo-history implied with the Kansas Redlegs and the nature of the insurgency in Missouri during the American Civil War.  It is clear from some of the reviews that the author of the original book, perhaps, had some agenda to advance on this issue.  Regardless of how one feels about these things, it still is an exciting Western to watch.But the best part of the movie is how Clint Eastwood goes from being a simple and happy farmer to being a cold blooded killer back to a decent human being again.  Actors are at their best when they portray those going through personal transformations.

This isn't a negative review of Clint, it's a negative review of a terrible movie.------------Orignal Review below:Based on all the positive feedback and what seems to be an interesting storyline I finally got around to seeing this movie and wow was I disappointed. First it looks more like a made for TV movie from the mid-70s than a full fledged movie, there is nothing epic or big about this movie. Second, with the exception of Eastwood and maybe a couple of others the acting is awful. Third by the end of the movie I find myself hoping the Indians come in an slaughter everyone, that's how little I cared for an how much I disliked the characters surrounding Eastwood.

233491,A32IWIJ6UI3YYF,6300269043,coachtim,"[1, 1]","""The Outlaw Josie Wales"" is a terrific western directed by Clint Eastwood.  Eastwood, as Wales, is at his laconic best as a farmer-turned-vigilante who spends the majority of the movie seeking vengeance against ""Redleggers"" who kill his wife, son, and later his friends.  As with all of Eastwood's movies, he lets his co-stars share the screen with him which makes all of his movies so intriguing, memorable, and character-driven.  Sondra Locke shines in her first major role - that of a young daughter moving to a better life with her mother.  Chief Dan George practically steals the show as Josie Wales' Indian companion and has some of the best and most humorous lines in the film.  Bill McKinney, John Quade, John Mitchum, and a number of familiar faces from other Eastwood films are present in ""TOJW"".  John Vernon (Of ""Animal House"" fame and all those great voice-overs) plays a former Wales com padre turned traitor.  Also look for veteran character actor, Richard Farnsworth (""The Natural"", et. al.) as a Comanchero in an uncredited role.The body count is as high as anything Sam Peckinpaugh directed and the movie contains a graphic rape scene, so this film is not for the family or the faint-hearted.All in all, this film ranks with any of Eastwood's best, including ""Unforgiven"", ""Pale Rider"", and the ""Dirty Harry"" series.

He gets choice roles playing likable guys, and  his ""Lone Watie"" character here is no exception. Eastwood, as "" Josey Wales,"" reverts successfully back to his ""Man with no name"" persona: you know, the strong silent and somewhat mean type. He's a lot like the characters John Wayne played late in his career.

233495,AUHG8KSHI529U,6300269043,Craig Matteson,"[2, 2]","This is a widely admired Clint Eastwood Western that he also directed.  Josey Wales (Eastwood) was a Missouri farmer whose wife and son were killed and his farm burned by the Red Leg raiders from the Union Army sent to burn out the Confederates.  Wales joins up with some Confederates who fight against the Union for the remainder of the Civil War.  The crux of the film begins when the war ends and all but Josey surrender and take an oath of loyalty to the Union and are all gunned down.  Josey tries to rescue who he can and ends up on the run from the Red Legs and his former Confederate commander, Fletcher (John Vernon).  Sam Bottoms gets a nice turn as Jamie who admires Josey and wanted to follow him, but was forced to surrender against his better judgement.The rest of the film is about Wales confronting a variety of bounty hunters, opportunists, and soldiers who want to take him out.  He also makes friends with another range of well meaning folks including Indians including a character played by Chief Dan George, Geraldine Keams as Little Moonlight, and Will Sampson as Ten Bears.  Sondra Locke gets a role as Laura Lee and Paula Truman in a memorable turn as Grandma Sarah (see if her delivery doesn't remind you a bit of Hyman Roth in the Godfather - but without the venom).  There are a lot of other memorable actors in fine performances in a very fine Western that has an interesting core underneath its series of violent confrontations.There is one particularly violent scene of intended rape of Laura Lee that is only stopped by Josey killing those who intended to rape her.  While there is a lot of killing in the movie, and it is clear that Josey's wife was raped, it is this scene that especially graphic for 1976 and still shocking today.That aside, I think this is a worthwhile movie.Reviewed by Craig Matteson, Ann Arbor, MI",5,"A very fine, if violent, Western",1198540800,"12 25, 2007",2007,1852,"['widely', 'admired', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'Western', 'also', 'directed', 'Josey', 'Wales', 'Eastwood', 'was', 'Missouri', 'farmer', 'wife', 'son', 'were', 'killed', 'farm', 'burned', 'Red', 'Leg', 'raiders', 'Union', 'Army', 'sent', 'burn', 'out', 'Confederates', 'Wales', 'up', 'Confederates', 'who', 'fight', 'Union', 'remainder', 'Civil', 'War', 'crux', 'film', 'when', 'war', 'ends', 'Josey', 'surrender', 'take', 'oath', 'loyalty', 'Union', 'are', 'gunned', 'down', 'Josey', 'rescue', 'who', 'can', 'up', 'run', 'Red', 'Legs', 'former', 'Confederate', 'commander', 'Fletcher', 'John', 'Vernon', 'Sam', 'Bottoms', 'nice', 'turn', 'Jamie', 'who', 'Josey', 'wanted', 'follow', 'was', 'forced', 'surrender', 'better', 'judgement.The', 'rest', 'film', 'Wales', 'confronting', 'variety', 'bounty', 'hunters', 'opportunists', 'soldiers', 'who', 'want', 'take', 'out', 'also', 'friends', 'range', 'well', 'meaning', 'folks', 'including', 'Indians', 'including', 'character', 'played', 'Chief', 'Dan', 'George', 'Geraldine', 'Keams', 'Little', 'Moonlight', 'Will', 'Sampson', 'Ten', 'Bears', 'Sondra', 'Locke', 'role', 'Laura', 'Lee', 'Paula', 'Truman', 'memorable', 'turn', 'Grandma', 'Sarah', 'see', 'delivery', ""n't"", 'remind', 'bit', 'Hyman', 'Roth', 'Godfather', 'venom', 'are', 'lot', 'other', 'memorable', 'actors', 'fine', 'performances', 'very', 'fine', 'Western', 'interesting', 'core', 'underneath', 'series', 'violent', 'confrontations.There', 'one', 'particularly', 'violent', 'scene', 'intended', 'rape', 'Laura', 'Lee', 'only', 'stopped', 'Josey', 'killing', 'who', 'intended', 'rape', 'lot', 'killing', 'movie', 'clear', 'Josey', 'wife', 'was', 'raped', 'scene', 'especially', 'graphic', '1976', 'still', 'shocking', 'aside', 'think', 'worthwhile', 'movie.Reviewed', 'Craig', 'Matteson', 'Ann', 'Arbor', 'MI']",N/A
233496,A1Z3LU078VNOA6,6300269043,C. Wynes,"[6, 6]","This film meets and surpasses all expectations.  If you are a fan of westerns, or of Clint Eastwood in particular, this film is a must-own.Eastwood plays a man whose family is brutally murdered by the Redlegs, a band of guerilla warriors who fought for Kansas under the leadership of the dastardly Jennison and his ""Jayhawkers"" during the Civil War.  They were the foil of William Clarke Quantrill and his followers who fought for Missouri during the war.  (For more on this conflict, albeit with an unfortunate Jayhawk-slant, see the recent film ""Ride with the Devil"".)As for its treatment of the Civil War, this film follows ""The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly"" in the sense that it does not explicitly take a side.  It does, however, present characters that are much more aware of a war going on and who are much more partisan about it than were the bit-players in that last of the Leone trilogy.Yet Eastwood's film here abandons the partisanship that so embodies even a contemporary discussion of the war in the American South.  Despite his family being brutally murdered by Kansans, Josey Wales ultimately rises above the conflict in his attempt to get what he wants out of life.  Josey is rightfully distrustful of the Union, but he doesn't translate that into a political vendetta.  The conflict does not destroy him, even when the prejudices of anti-Confederate Kansans are poised to strike him down.The story finds Josey making unlikely friendships with those he encounters along his way, and provides many good-natured comic moments in those encounters.  Josey Wales is the quintessential Western character, an average farmer who is dragged into conflicts larger than his own by the circumstances around him, forced to play a role that he never is fully willing to embrace.Eastwood, despite being new to directing, delivers on the potential of this film in full.  The cinematography is consistently engaging, the soundtrack is interesting, and the performances are stellar.  This is definitely a 70's style western, and Eastwood practically defines the era with this picture.If you are a fan of the Leone trilogy wondering whether Eastwood was ever as good apart from those films, then this is the one to see.  If you are an Eastwood fan from his recent films, then this is a great introduction to the skills he would consistently display as a director in the future.  If you are looking at this film from the viewpoint of a typical western-genre fan, you will not be disappointed by this film's excellent story and great performances.

Eastwood skillfully plays a sympathetic character whose wife and child are killed during the Civil War near Kansas by the Union ""Redlegs"" who are virtually roguing military. Seeking revenge for his loss, he joins a Bloody Bill Anderson's guerrilla unit that strikes unmercifully against the union forces. As the war ends, the majority of the unit comes in to surrender except for Josey and they are slaughtered by the Redlegs who seek retaliation. And there is your story; Josey becomes the hunted as he and one escaping companion are hunted virtually to eternity. Eastwood plays the character perfectly as he carries multiple pistols and weapons as Confederate cavalry did to even fire power, even with loaded cylinders that he can interchange with his pistols. Comical at times, as Eastwood seems to pick up lost souls from Indian Dan George (Little Bigman), to an abused female Indian, a cranky granny and her attractive yet pensive daughter (Locke) and even a red boned cur dog who suffers the indignity of Josey's spiteful but accurate tobacco spit (but the dog follows anyways). George has several lines that work as commentary on  the plight of the 'Civilized Tribes' and the Cherokees choice of backing the south. He also invokes great humor with lines like, ""I didn't surrender, but they took my horse. He surrendered"". The movie is a thrill a minute as Josey frequently has to shoot his way out of traps, accidental discoveries, the rescue of one of his lost souls and the climatic ending where he finally finds a peaceful place until he is found again not only by his old enemies but the Indians in his adopted home. In each circumstance where he finds himself confronted with danger and as always outnumbered, he always seeks an edge to give him some advantage, and when he spits, there is going to be some shooting. And there is a sub-climatic moment where Josey meets with his Indian counterpoint, recognizing that they have recently lived parallel lives, each being hunted and perhaps abused, making a statement that each deserves a better life.

Rather than just another minor Western, Eastwood turned the genre around by focusing more on character than just action and earned an accolade from one of the greatest filmmakers ever, Orson Welles. In an interview with Dick Cavett, Welles stated that this film ranks with some of the best Westerns that John Ford ever made and is one of the best American films ever made. To further state this point, Welles even sent a letter to Clint expressing his delight in viewing this film. Like Ford, this film has some interesting characters from Chief Dan George's wayward Indian to Granny to the characters in the saloon(Royal Dano, Sheb Wooley, etc). Phil Kaufman, the original director, differed in view from Clint about the conception of this film since Clint wanted it to be more of an epic rather than a small western--so Kaufman was fired and Clint took the reins.

Mikels ""It's always Happy Hour here""","[7, 7]","Okay, I'll admit it:  this film has some goofy quirks, uneven moments, and scenes where Clint mumbles his lines as if he were a ventriloquist, yet THE OUTLAW JOSEY WALES remains one of my very favorite westerns.  I saw this movie when it first came out in 1976, watched it every time I could find it on cable, then purchased the VHS tape when it first became available.  After all these years--after countless viewings--this film remains as entertaining and as enjoyable as the night I first saw it on the big screen.The story is compelling:  Josey Wales, a quiet, peaceful Missouri farmer, joins a band of Confederate soldiers to avenge the brutal murders of his wife and son (played by Eastwood's son, Kyle), then refuses to surrender at the end of the war.  He becomes an outlaw, hunted relentlessly by the very Union soldiers who killed his family, a manhunt that sends Wales and an ever-growing group of stragglers deep into Texas.  ""Sometimes trouble just follows a man,"" Wales laments prophetically.  And sometimes a character--like Josey Wales--portrays such a rich depth of anger, anguish, and an overwhelming desire to live in peace, that the viewer is mesmerized by the injustice of it all.Clint Eastwood directed this movie, his very first to direct, and gave notice to Hollywood that he was also a force to be reckoned with behind the camera.  The cast is uneven, but Chief Dan George, Will Sampson, and John Vernon stand out and give impressive performances.

233515,A2D8CUJPOSRPNA,6300269043,Erik North,"[9, 9]","Aside from his multi-Oscar-winning 1992 film UNFORGIVEN, THE OUTLAW JOSIE WALES, released in the summer of 1976, may very well be the pinnacle of Clint Eastwood's career both in front of and behind the camera.  This is an epic western where Eastwood leaves behind the Man With No Name persona he had cultivated in the spaghetti westerns of director Sergio Leone in the 1960s.  For here, he is a man with a name...and a conscience to go along with it.Eastwood's Josie Wales is a Missouri farmer making out a quiet life for himself amidst the turbulent end of the Civil War who must watch in horror as marauding Union men tear up his land and kill his family.  Joining up with a group of Confederate rebels to ""set things right"", Eastwood soon finds himself on the run from a Union detachment, led by his former commander (John Vernon) and a ruthless soldier (Bill McKinney, who portrayed one of the evil mountain men in DELIVERANCE).  In his travails through the Southwest, he makes friends with a wise old Comanche (Chief Dan George) and makes an effort to find peace.  But when the Union men close in on him, then he is forced to resort to violence.A fairly long film, at 135 minutes, and riddled with scenes of occasional violent gunplay and sex scenes, THE OUTLAW JOSIE WALES nevertheless shows a more human side to Eastwood's persona than the more modern-day Dirty Harry films.  This is in large part due to the complexity of the character as laid out in the screenplay by Phil Kaufman (who was the original director, but was replaced by Eastwood after the two men clashed) and Sonia Chernus, from Forrest Carter's book ""Gone To Texas.""  It also gives Eastwood a chance to stretch himself as an actor with some memorable one-liners, particularly in a scene involving a bounty hunter (John Davis Chandler):BOUNTY HUNTER: ""You're wanted, Wales.""WALES: ""Reckon I'm right popular.  You a bounty hunter?""BOUNTY HUNTER: ""A man's gotta do somethin' for a livin' these days.""WALES: ""Dyin' ain't much of a livin', boy.""As is commonplace with Eastwood as a director, he gives some of his favorite fellow actors prime supporting roles for their talents, George in particular, but also Vernon, whose role as a sympathetic heavy is as rich in complexities as Eastwood's Josie Wales.  John Quade, John Mitchum, Royal Dano, Sondra Locke (soon to be Eastwood's beau), Matt Clark, and Paula Trueman are among the other actors that give good support to Eastwood.Filmed in various parts of California, Utah, Arizona, and Nevada and complete with a superb score by Jerry Fielding, who was nominated for an Oscar here (as he had been on THE WILD BUNCH and STRAW DOGS), THE OUTLAW JOSIE WALES proved not only the magnitude of Eastwood's talents, but also the durability of the western genre in the morally complex world of post-Vietnam America.

It was a movie that was set in the time immediately following the Civil War and Eastwood was cast as one of a rag-tag group of leftovers from the war. It opened with a touching scene of Eastwood having his wife and son killed and their house burned down by on outlaw gang of bluecoats. One just doesn't do that to Eastwood, of course. The rest of the movie had to do with Eastwood tracking down the perpetrators and he himself became the object of an intensive manhunt. Supposedly all this happened from Missouri, across Kansas and Oklahoma (Indian Territory) and down into Texas (Mexico), but I could see from the scenery that it was filmed in Colorado, Arizona and Utah. That's fine, the scenery was beautiful.It was an engaging and touching tale. Interesting time period, too. The movie seemed long and somewhat drawn out and slow in action for an Eastwood western. Still, there were a lot of gunfights and associated violence that one has come to expect with an Eastwood western. It was well done and an excellent movie, but I would not rank it with one of his best westerns, On the other hand, I'd give it a few bonus points for it's interesting historical perspective.Gary Peterson",5,Interesting Historical Perspective.,1281484800,"08 11, 2010",2010,1311,"['wife', 'have', 'greatly', 'enjoyed', 'western', 'movies', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'last', 'night', 'watched', 'Outlaw', 'Josey', 'Wales', 'was', 'movie', 'was', 'set', 'time', 'immediately', 'following', 'Civil', 'War', 'Eastwood', 'was', 'cast', 'one', 'rag-tag', 'group', 'leftovers', 'war', 'opened', 'touching', 'scene', 'Eastwood', 'having', 'wife', 'son', 'killed', 'house', 'burned', 'down', 'outlaw', 'gang', 'bluecoats', 'One', 'just', ""n't"", 'do', 'Eastwood', 'course', 'rest', 'movie', 'had', 'do', 'Eastwood', 'tracking', 'down', 'perpetrators', 'became', 'object', 'intensive', 'manhunt', 'Supposedly', 'happened', 'Missouri', 'Kansas', 'Oklahoma', 'Indian', 'Territory', 'down', 'Texas', 'Mexico', 'could', 'see', 'scenery', 'was', 'filmed', 'Colorado', 'Arizona', 'Utah', 'fine', 'scenery', 'was', 'beautiful.It', 'was', 'engaging', 'touching', 'tale', 'Interesting', 'time', 'period', 'too', 'movie', 'seemed', 'long', 'somewhat', 'drawn', 'out', 'slow', 'action', 'Eastwood', 'western', 'Still', 'were', 'lot', 'gunfights', 'associated', 'violence', 'one', 'come', 'expect', 'Eastwood', 'western', 'was', 'well', 'done', 'excellent', 'movie', 'would', 'not', 'rank', 'one', 'best', 'westerns', 'other', 'hand', ""'d"", 'give', 'few', 'bonus', 'points', 'interesting', 'historical', 'perspective.Gary', 'Peterson']",N/A

233529,A3A4WQL80WOTMH,6300269043,Green Manalishi,"[4, 31]","This movie is ok but not fantastic compared to the Sergio Leone classics.  Even Pale Rider, also directed by Eastwood, was a much better movie with a more fulfilling and beleivable character and story. The characters in this film are kind of wooden and less than realistic.  Never mind that the blood on Josey's face just after his family is killed in the beginning looks like it was dabbed on with Halloween vampire blood - his transition from wronged gentle farmer to mythic gunfighter Josie Wales happens within the first ten minutes - so quick, it's like - what?  Nothing leads us through the transition except we see he's suddenly joined a band of men, ""outlaws"" who are really the good guys, and within a matter of minutes he's a heroic gun-fighter.At least with his ""Man with no name"" characters, we accept that as basis of the movie style.  Here the movie makes some claim toward telling the story of a historic figure. OK, I get it, we're here for entertainment, but I found much of its total lack of realism less than entertaining or credible especially with the above mentioned claim in mind.  I don't find it realistic that he was speaking perfect English with the Commanche chief when he goes to settle things with the chief (who played ""Chief"" in One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest).  It's doubtful that Native Americans still practicing their traditional way of life in a secluded part of the American frontier (i.e., not living on a reservation or in much contact with white men) would speak and understand the kind of fluent and colloquial English that Wales (Eastwood) speaks, however noble the sentiment.  For a realistic depiction of what that would be like see Redford's exchange with the chief in Jeremiah Johnson.Another thing right at the beginning of the movie that bugged and gave me inclination as to what to expect later on was when his friend gets shot and later ends up riding with him - he's been seriously shot yet you'd swear he was ready for a day at the beach..  And frankly speaking, I got a little tired of old Josie's constant spitting - which was occasionally humorous - like when he kept nailing his poor dog.  I mostly got a hick 70s vibe from this film rather than 'end of the civil war'.  I generally like 70s movies, and Clint Eastwood movies for sure, but this one lasted too long - sometimes I'd fast forward slow enough to read the dialogue but skip another dragged out wooden dialogue.After the director's comment in the beginning of the movie where Clint himself says it's one of his favorites, I was expecting a little more.  Maybe because he was directing it or because of the content - hard to beleive out of all the great movies he's done this would be his favorite. Yes, it touches on some of the maurading elements that existed amidst the chaos at the end of the civil war, but nothing really educated us on this issue (if indeed he felt this was important).

233532,A2UYAFQ40U2PHS,6300269043,"Grigory's Girl ""GR""","[1, 2]","I initially saw this film when I was in high school.  It was OK, but I've recently revisited it (seeing it in a widescreen, digital transfer on DVD over the pan and scan crap on VHS does wonders for it), and it's one of Clint Eastwood's greatest achievements as director and as actor.  It was only his fifth film as director, and it shows a deep maturity and intelligence that usually wasn't seen in Westerns (or Hollywood, for that matter).  It's a great film, a work of art, a true epic, and a poetic, complex, and profound depiction of the West, the Civil War (and war itself), history, and America.There are so many thing to admire and love about this film.  One is its depiction of southern rebels in the Civil War.  Too often the press and Hollywood always make the Civil War to be about slavery, when the reasons for war were far more complex and convoluted than an easy, misleading Holllywood history lesson would show.  The Confederate soldiers are portrayed with much more complexity and empathy than usual, and the Union soldiers are depicted as cruel and as unforgiving as soldiers (especially in times of war) can be.  There are many great scenes in the film.  There's an early shootout in the film where many Confederate soldiers, who have finally surrendered, are mowed down viciously and thoughtlessly.  It's a searing indictment of the ""kind"" victors in war.  The scene where Josey Wales and Little Bear (the leader of the local Commanche tribe) make peace is one of the most powerful and moving scenes in the film, and one of the greatest scenes in Western history.  The film is beautifully shot by Bruce Surtees, an early Clint favorite and one of Hollywood's greatest cinematographers.  Clint wasn't the original director on this film.  The co-screenwriter, Philip Kaufman (who went on to direct great films like Henry and June and The Right Stuff), actually directed the film for about a week, but then Clint fired him and took over the direction himself, as Clint felt Philip was going too slow.  Clint ended up coming in with the film 8 days ahead of schedule, despite the change in directors.  Even though Kaufman's career and ego were deeply hurt, he eventually recovered and went onto his own distinguished career.  Eastwood was really the only choice to direct this film.The performances here are some of the best in any of Eastwood's work.  John Vernon as Josey Wales's mentor Fletcher gives a real towering performance.  Sam Bottoms is fine as the young sidekick of Josey.  Chief Dan George is wonderful as an old Native American that tags along, and Will Sampson is wonderful and moving as Chief Little Bear.  Even Sondra Locke, who is often criticised by just about everybody, is very good here.The film has some great dialogue, with two of the most memorable lines in Western history.  ""Dyin' ain't much of a livin', boy"" and ""don't piss on my back and tell me it's raining"" are forever in Western folklore.The DVD is excellent too, with 2 documentaries, one made during filming, and a recent one made a few years back.  Both are excellent, and shed some fascinating light on this film, which grows in depth and meaning during repeated viewings.  It's one of Eastwood's finest films, and one of the greatest Westerns ever made.",5,One of Clint Eastwood's finest achievements....,1219104000,"08 19, 2008",2008,3259,"['initially', 'saw', 'film', 'when', 'was', 'high', 'school', 'was', 'OK', ""'ve"", 'recently', 'revisited', 'seeing', 'widescreen', 'digital', 'transfer', 'DVD', 'pan', 'scan', 'crap', 'VHS', 'wonders', 'one', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'greatest', 'achievements', 'director', 'actor', 'was', 'only', 'fifth', 'film', 'director', 'deep', 'maturity', 'intelligence', 'usually', 'was', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Westerns', 'Hollywood', 'matter', 'great', 'film', 'work', 'art', 'true', 'epic', 'poetic', 'complex', 'profound', 'depiction', 'West', 'Civil', 'War', 'war', 'history', 'America.There', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'thing', 'admire', 'love', 'film', 'One', 'depiction', 'southern', 'rebels', 'Civil', 'War', 'Too', 'often', 'press', 'Hollywood', 'always', 'make', 'Civil', 'War', 'be', 'about', 'slavery', 'when', 'reasons', 'war', 'were', 'far', 'more', 'complex', 'convoluted', 'easy', 'misleading', 'Holllywood', 'history', 'lesson', 'would', 'show', 'Confederate', 'soldiers', 'are', 'portrayed', 'much', 'more', 'complexity', 'empathy', 'usual', 'Union', 'soldiers', 'are', 'depicted', 'cruel', 'as', 'unforgiving', 'soldiers', 'especially', 'times', 'war', 'can', 'be', 'are', 'many', 'great', 'scenes', 'film', 'early', 'shootout', 'film', 'where', 'many', 'Confederate', 'soldiers', 'who', 'have', 'finally', 'surrendered', 'are', 'mowed', 'viciously', 'thoughtlessly', 'searing', 'indictment', 'kind', 'victors', 'war', 'scene', 'where', 'Josey', 'Wales', 'Little', 'Bear', 'leader', 'local', 'Commanche', 'tribe', 'make', 'peace', 'one', 'most', 'powerful', 'moving', 'scenes', 'film', 'one', 'greatest', 'scenes', 'Western', 'history', 'film', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'Bruce', 'Surtees', 'early', 'Clint', 'favorite', 'one', 'Hollywood', 'greatest', 'cinematographers', 'Clint', 'was', ""n't"", 'original', 'director', 'film', 'co-screenwriter', 'Philip', 'Kaufman', 'who', 'went', 'direct', 'great', 'films', 'Henry', 'June', 'Right', 'Stuff', 'actually', 'directed', 'film', 'week', 'then', 'Clint', 'fired', 'took', 'over', 'direction', 'Clint', 'felt', 'Philip', 'was', 'going', 'too', 'slow', 'Clint', 'ended', 'up', 'coming', 'film', '8', 'days', 'ahead', 'schedule', 'change', 'directors', 'Even', 'Kaufman', 'career', 'ego', 'were', 'deeply', 'hurt', 'eventually', 'recovered', 'went', 'own', 'distinguished', 'career', 'Eastwood', 'was', 'really', 'only', 'choice', 'direct', 'film.The', 'performances', 'here', 'are', 'best', 'Eastwood', 'work', 'John', 'Vernon', 'Josey', 'Wales', 'mentor', 'Fletcher', 'real', 'towering', 'performance', 'Sam', 'Bottoms', 'fine', 'young', 'sidekick', 'Josey', 'Chief', 'Dan', 'George', 'wonderful', 'old', 'Native', 'American', 'along', 'Will', 'Sampson', 'wonderful', 'moving', 'as', 'Chief', 'Little', 'Bear', 'Even', 'Sondra', 'Locke', 'who', 'often', 'criticised', 'just', 'everybody', 'very', 'good', 'here.The', 'film', 'great', 'dialogue', 'two', 'most', 'memorable', 'lines', 'Western', 'history', 'Dyin', 'ai', ""n't"", 'much', 'livin', 'boy', 'do', ""n't"", 'piss', 'back', 'tell', 'raining', 'are', 'forever', 'Western', 'folklore.The', 'DVD', 'excellent', 'too', '2', 'documentaries', 'one', 'made', 'filming', 'recent', 'one', 'made', 'few', 'years', 'back', 'are', 'excellent', 'shed', 'fascinating', 'light', 'film', 'depth', 'meaning', 'repeated', 'viewings', 'one', 'Eastwood', 'finest', 'films', 'one', 'greatest', 'Westerns', 'ever', 'made']",N/A

233548,A2K9IVPCTJUQHN,6300269043,Jeff Cordell,"[5, 5]","I first saw this movie when I was ten in 1978. I thought all the gunfights were real cool. Well I was ten years old. I then saw the movie ten years later but I was twenty and had been raised on a steady diet of Stallone,  Schwartzenager, and Bruce Willis movies. I found the movie to be slow  without enough explosions, machine-gun fire or supercharged heroics. I was  also very much into my brand new career as a soldier in the U.S. Army and a  super patriot. Well I just saw this movie a few weeks ago. I'm thirty-two  now, a husband and father of two. I am no longer in love with the Army and  not so enamored with the Federal goverment or flag waving. Perhaps that's  unfortunate but true. Now I see this movie with a different eye. Here you  have a story about a man who probably never wanted anything to do with  either side in the Civil War. If left alone he would have been content to  farm his fields and spend his life with his familiy. But they're wiped out  by forces loyal to the Union and he embarks on his only course of action as  he sees fit. He becomes one of Quantrills gurellias and wades into the  bloodbath of Missouri and Kansas. But the many years of fighting neither  satisfy his desire for revenge nor give him peace. He becomes an outlaw  because he simply will not surrender to the Federals even though his side  has lost. In many ways he becomes a man with a pointless exsistence, but he  won't give up or quit. It's all he has left. Gradually he finds himself  with a family even though initially he dosen't want it. He is still a good  man inside and can't and won't turn his back on people who are in trouble.  This movie isn't a homage to revenge - Josie Wales isn't even seeking  revenge - but his old enemy comes after him. Wales really dosen't intend to  carry on the war he merely wants to go his own way, undefeated and defiant.  All in all this is a very good movie. Yes one can argue there is an  unrealistic amount of violence, but the years immediately preceeding the  war were chaotic. Embittered Confederate veterans were wandering the  countryside and Carbetbaggers were doing everything in their power to get  rich at the expense of the locals. Federal troops were occupying most of  the South - to include Texas and emotions were running high. Violence  happened frequently. Don't forget Frank and Jesse James were also veterans  of Quantrills force. This movie has aged extremely well and in my opinion  is better then most of the recent westerns - perhaps even better than  Unforgiven, but that's up to the individual to decide.",4,One of Eastwoods best,954547200,"04 1, 2000",2000,2577,"['first', 'saw', 'movie', 'when', 'was', 'ten', '1978', 'thought', 'gunfights', 'were', 'real', 'cool', 'Well', 'was', 'ten', 'years', 'old', 'then', 'saw', 'movie', 'ten', 'years', 'later', 'was', 'twenty', 'had', 'been', 'raised', 'steady', 'diet', 'Stallone', 'Schwartzenager', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'movies', 'found', 'movie', 'be', 'slow', 'enough', 'explosions', 'machine-gun', 'fire', 'supercharged', 'heroics', 'was', 'also', 'very', 'much', 'brand', 'new', 'career', 'soldier', 'U.S.', 'Army', 'super', 'patriot', 'Well', 'just', 'saw', 'movie', 'few', 'weeks', 'ago', ""'m"", 'thirty-two', 'now', 'husband', 'father', 'two', 'am', 'no', 'longer', 'love', 'Army', 'not', 'so', 'enamored', 'Federal', 'goverment', 'flag', 'waving', 'Perhaps', 'unfortunate', 'true', 'Now', 'see', 'movie', 'different', 'eye', 'Here', 'have', 'story', 'man', 'who', 'probably', 'never', 'wanted', 'anything', 'do', 'side', 'Civil', 'War', 'left', 'alone', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'content', 'farm', 'fields', 'spend', 'life', 'familiy', ""'re"", 'wiped', 'out', 'forces', 'loyal', 'Union', 'only', 'course', 'action', 'fit', 'one', 'Quantrills', 'gurellias', 'wades', 'bloodbath', 'Missouri', 'Kansas', 'many', 'years', 'fighting', 'satisfy', 'desire', 'revenge', 'give', 'peace', 'outlaw', 'simply', 'will', 'not', 'surrender', 'Federals', 'even', 'side', 'lost', 'many', 'ways', 'man', 'pointless', 'exsistence', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'up', 'quit', 'left', 'Gradually', 'family', 'even', 'initially', 'dose', ""n't"", 'want', 'still', 'good', 'man', 'inside', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wo', ""n't"", 'turn', 'back', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'trouble', 'movie', ""n't"", 'homage', 'revenge', 'Josie', 'Wales', ""n't"", 'even', 'seeking', 'revenge', 'old', 'enemy', 'Wales', 'really', 'dose', ""n't"", 'intend', 'carry', 'war', 'merely', 'go', 'own', 'way', 'undefeated', 'defiant', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'Yes', 'one', 'can', 'argue', 'unrealistic', 'amount', 'violence', 'years', 'immediately', 'preceeding', 'war', 'were', 'chaotic', 'Embittered', 'Confederate', 'veterans', 'were', 'wandering', 'countryside', 'Carbetbaggers', 'were', 'doing', 'everything', 'power', 'get', 'rich', 'expense', 'locals', 'Federal', 'troops', 'were', 'occupying', 'most', 'South', 'include', 'Texas', 'emotions', 'were', 'running', 'high', 'Violence', 'happened', 'frequently', 'Do', ""n't"", 'forget', 'Frank', 'Jesse', 'James', 'were', 'also', 'veterans', 'Quantrills', 'force', 'movie', 'aged', 'extremely', 'well', 'opinion', 'better', 'then', 'most', 'recent', 'westerns', 'perhaps', 'even', 'better', 'Unforgiven', 'up', 'individual', 'decide']",N/A

Just some quick thoughts on this Clint Eastwood classic western...While Amazon is fantasizing about having drones deliver the goods you ordered right to your door (which is laughable), I'm busy watching movies that were made when movies were still good and America was still believable and still a great nation.  The Outlaw Josey Wales (1976) stars Clint Eastwood, John Vernon, Chief Dan George, Sondra Locke, and Bill McKinney and is one of the great westerns ever made.  This movie has a little of everything western in it and is highly entertaining.  The picture quality is great.  The scenery, color, cinematography, camera angles, acting, action...all spectacular.  Clint Eastwood wears multiple hats, as he also directed this movie.  In my opinion, the best Clint Eastwood western is Unforgiven (1992), but The Outlaw Josey Wales is right up there in second place, not far behind.  Other great Eastwood westerns are High Plains Drifter (1973) and The Good, The Bad, And The Ugly (1966).If you want to see a great western from a bygone era, then I highly recommend seeing The Outlaw Josey Wales.

233570,A1QFM9CFEUXZK5,6300269043,Kendra,"[10, 12]","The Outlaw Josey Wales is considered by some to be the greatest western. I agree.A great western should have a collection of strong key elements, and Josey Wales has them all. The setting is the savage Civil War in Missouri and Kansas where atrocities and outrages were perpetrated by irregulars of both sides. Folks at the time called these criminals and guerrillas ""bushwackers"". The fighting in this theater of the Civil War is not commonly known and was particularly ugly and violent. Most actions were small unit affairs, with people who were well known to one another before the war fighting under opposing flags. Violence and crimes against civilians was common as both legitimate armies used irregulars to terrorize the civilian population. The massacre at Centralia, Missouri, September 27, 1864 was perpetrated by Bloody Bill Anderson and his men. There is no mention of this event in the film, of course, as there could be no sympathy for anyone who had had a part in that abomination.Josey Wales captures the ugliness and horror of those times and provides a motivator to the title character when his family is murdered by Kansas Union irregulars. Wales is enraged and joins Bloody Bill Anderson's Confederate guerrilla outfit. When the War ends, they are one of the last organized Confederate units to surrender (at least according to the film). Wales' comrades surrender themselves at a Union camp, but Josey refuses. But everything is not as it seems and as the men surrender their arms and take the Oath of Allegiance to the Union, they are viciously murdered in cold blood. It turns out that the same unit that has just killed his fellow Confederates is the very same that had killed his family several years before. And so the chase begins... Wales is now the ""Outlaw Josey Wales"" running from bounty hunters and every male in the territory with a gun not to mention the Union army.Josey Wales is played by Clint Eastwood in one his best performances. The character is very much like the ""Man with no name"" from his Spaghetti Western days. Closer to ""Blondie"" in The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly than the silent gunslinger of ""Pale Rider"", Wales is essentially a good man driven to revenge and violence by circumstances. He is the everyman of the Civil War dragged into the maelstrom of events. As he runs from his pursuers he picks up a ragtag crew of fascinating characters who ride with him, eventually heading for southern Texas. Along the way there are gunfights, suspense, and lots of action.A great western should have certain components including:* beautiful desert scenery* a good story line* small ramshackle frontier towns* a hero or anti-hero with strong and understandable motivations* guns, ideally pistols* cool hats* indians* lots of horses* rotten villainsOutlaw Josey Wales was directed by Eastwood, too. Sandra Locke, Chief Dan George, and John Vernon co-star.Wales is an avenger as he rides across deserts and through broken down frontier towns. He has no options, but to find a place to hide, or just keep on riding forever. Every shooting that involve him is self-defense or in the defense of others who cannot defend themselves. He is a hero, an unsurrendered Confederate partisan, haunted by the senseless murder of his family.Josey Wales has beautiful scenery, lots of horses and pistols, rotten villains who deserve to get shot (and generally do), suffering innocents who need protection, and one of the coolest hats in American cinema history.Josey Wales' hat is stained with sweat, it's a deep Confederate Gray with a wide and slightly upturned brim. Eastwood hides his eyes under the brim of this hat, and when he slightly lifts his head to look at someone - they know quickly that Wales is not a man to be trifled with. He has a sense of honor and obligation to others, but has no compunction in shooting those who are hunting him or are fixin' to hurt his friends.There is a touching moment after Eastwood and his friends have arrived at their Texas destination. Sondra Locke, dressed in a fine white dress, talks about how beautiful the clouds look. She represents the stability, and happiness of his pre-war life and the look of sadness and dissociation that Eastwood delivers is a fine and sad one. After all of his war-fighting, his losses, and the personal toll that the War has taken, Josey Wales must try very hard to find a place for himself in a peaceful and stable post-war environment. Killing is easy now for him; it's living without violence that will be so challenging. One of the more powerful aspects of his character is that he so wants to try.",5,Greatest Western of All Time!,1206662400,"03 28, 2008",2008,4609,"['Outlaw', 'Josey', 'Wales', 'considered', 'be', 'greatest', 'western', 'agree.A', 'great', 'western', 'should', 'have', 'collection', 'strong', 'key', 'elements', 'Josey', 'Wales', 'setting', 'savage', 'Civil', 'War', 'Missouri', 'Kansas', 'where', 'atrocities', 'outrages', 'were', 'perpetrated', 'irregulars', 'sides', 'Folks', 'time', 'called', 'criminals', 'guerrillas', 'bushwackers', 'fighting', 'theater', 'Civil', 'War', 'not', 'commonly', 'known', 'was', 'particularly', 'ugly', 'violent', 'Most', 'actions', 'were', 'small', 'unit', 'affairs', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'well', 'known', 'one', 'war', 'fighting', 'opposing', 'flags', 'Violence', 'crimes', 'civilians', 'was', 'common', 'legitimate', 'armies', 'used', 'irregulars', 'terrorize', 'civilian', 'population', 'massacre', 'Centralia', 'Missouri', 'September', '27', '1864', 'was', 'perpetrated', 'Bloody', 'Bill', 'Anderson', 'men', 'mention', 'event', 'film', 'course', 'could', 'be', 'sympathy', 'anyone', 'who', 'had', 'had', 'part', 'abomination.Josey', 'Wales', 'ugliness', 'horror', 'times', 'motivator', 'title', 'character', 'when', 'family', 'murdered', 'Kansas', 'Union', 'irregulars', 'Wales', 'enraged', 'Bloody', 'Bill', 'Anderson', 'Confederate', 'guerrilla', 'outfit', 'When', 'War', 'ends', 'are', 'one', 'last', 'organized', 'Confederate', 'units', 'surrender', 'least', 'according', 'film', 'Wales', 'comrades', 'surrender', 'Union', 'camp', 'Josey', 'everything', 'not', 'men', 'surrender', 'arms', 'take', 'Oath', 'Allegiance', 'Union', 'are', 'viciously', 'murdered', 'cold', 'blood', 'out', 'same', 'unit', 'just', 'killed', 'fellow', 'Confederates', 'very', 'same', 'had', 'killed', 'family', 'several', 'years', 'so', 'chase', 'Wales', 'now', 'Outlaw', 'Josey', 'Wales', 'running', 'bounty', 'hunters', 'male', 'territory', 'gun', 'not', 'mention', 'Union', 'army.Josey', 'Wales', 'played', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'character', 'very', 'much', 'Man', 'name', 'Spaghetti', 'Western', 'days', 'Closer', 'Blondie', 'Good', 'Bad', 'Ugly', 'silent', 'gunslinger', 'Pale', 'Rider', 'Wales', 'essentially', 'good', 'man', 'driven', 'revenge', 'violence', 'circumstances', 'everyman', 'Civil', 'War', 'dragged', 'maelstrom', 'events', 'pursuers', 'up', 'ragtag', 'crew', 'fascinating', 'characters', 'who', 'ride', 'eventually', 'heading', 'southern', 'Texas', 'way', 'are', 'gunfights', 'suspense', 'lots', 'action.A', 'great', 'western', 'should', 'have', 'certain', 'components', 'including', '*', 'beautiful', 'desert', 'scenery*', 'good', 'story', 'small', 'ramshackle', 'frontier', 'towns*', 'hero', 'anti-hero', 'strong', 'understandable', 'motivations*', 'guns', 'ideally', 'pistols*', 'cool', 'hats*', 'indians*', 'lots', 'horses*', 'rotten', 'villainsOutlaw', 'Josey', 'Wales', 'was', 'directed', 'Eastwood', 'too', 'Sandra', 'Locke', 'Chief', 'Dan', 'George', 'John', 'Vernon', 'co-star.Wales', 'avenger', 'deserts', 'broken', 'down', 'frontier', 'towns', 'options', 'find', 'place', 'hide', 'just', 'keep', 'riding', 'forever', 'Every', 'shooting', 'involve', 'self-defense', 'defense', 'others', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'defend', 'hero', 'unsurrendered', 'Confederate', 'partisan', 'haunted', 'senseless', 'murder', 'family.Josey', 'Wales', 'beautiful', 'scenery', 'lots', 'horses', 'pistols', 'rotten', 'villains', 'who', 'deserve', 'get', 'shot', 'generally', 'do', 'suffering', 'innocents', 'who', 'need', 'protection', 'one', 'coolest', 'hats', 'American', 'cinema', 'history.Josey', 'Wales', 'hat', 'stained', 'sweat', 'deep', 'Confederate', 'Gray', 'wide', 'slightly', 'upturned', 'brim', 'Eastwood', 'eyes', 'brim', 'hat', 'when', 'slightly', 'head', 'look', 'someone', 'know', 'quickly', 'Wales', 'not', 'man', 'be', 'trifled', 'sense', 'honor', 'obligation', 'others', 'compunction', 'shooting', 'who', 'are', 'hunting', 'are', 'fixin', 'hurt', 'friends.There', 'touching', 'moment', 'Eastwood', 'friends', 'have', 'arrived', 'Texas', 'destination', 'Sondra', 'Locke', 'dressed', 'fine', 'white', 'dress', 'talks', 'how', 'beautiful', 'clouds', 'look', 'stability', 'happiness', 'pre-war', 'life', 'look', 'sadness', 'dissociation', 'Eastwood', 'delivers', 'fine', 'sad', 'one', 'war-fighting', 'losses', 'personal', 'toll', 'War', 'taken', 'Josey', 'Wales', 'must', 'try', 'very', 'hard', 'find', 'place', 'peaceful', 'stable', 'post-war', 'environment', 'Killing', 'easy', 'now', 'living', 'violence', 'will', 'be', 'so', 'challenging', 'One', 'more', 'powerful', 'aspects', 'character', 'so', 'try']",N/A

233573,ABLOQZIL42W7I,6300269043,"kone ""kone""","[38, 43]","While he was still a star and hero on the long-running TV western Wagon Train, Clint Eastwood emerged on the Hollywood scene in western-theme movies, specifically his trio of ""spaghetti westerns"" with director Sergi Leone, the best being ""The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly"".After establishing another remarkable character in Dirty Harry, Clint returns to his western ""roots"" as the vengeful Josie Wales, in ""The Outlaw Josie Wales"".  This is Clint's 31st film and his fifth as a director.  Actually, the film was started with a different director, Philip Kaufman of ""The Right Stuff"" fame.  After numerous and intractable arguments over the interpretation of the film, Clint fired his director a week into shooting and took over directorship himself.  We will never know what sort of film Mr. Kaufman would have produced, but Eastwood's final product is a true gem in western filmmaking.In Eastwood's western trilogy he was known only as ""the man with no name"", a loner who generously dispensed his form of western justice at the barrel of a gun (or two).  There was not much character development.  We don't learn what drives the man or what he feels inside.  With Josie Wales, Clint plows new ground, as he plumbs the emotions of the vengeful Wales.  He builds insights into the character and feelings of Wales, a man with a name AND feelings.  This makes the movie more than a mere ""shoot 'em up"", and adds depth and meaning to the film.  Eastwood does much the same and more, with his 1990 blockbuster (and his last western) ""Unforgiven"", with Oscar results.Josie Wales can be viewed with interest and pleasure on several different levels.  There is of course the ""vengeful man"" theme that is the movie's backbone.  Then there is the multi-cultural theme, where instead of going it alone, one man against many, Wales has a collection of ""family"" that collects as the movie progresses: an old Indian Chief, a talkative Indian ""Squaw"", a grandmother and her granddaughter (Sandra Locke, whom Clint would have an affair with that would end his marriage to his wife Maggie), and finally a collection of townies from a dying silver mining town.  Finally, there is the ""healing"" theme, namely, how does a man who suffers the violent loss of his wife, son, and home, deal with his vengeful anger, emotional loss, and begin to heal.Mere trivia, but interesting: Clint Eastwood never once shoots and kills a Native American Indian in any of his western films.  Instead of battling indians as do most of the other western film stars, Eastwood's charcters build alliances with the Natives, learning to live in peaceful co-existance rather than a state of perpetual war.Clearly, this is Eastwood's best western up to this point in his career.  It is definately worth a ""look"" and my guess is that it will become one of your favorite westerns.Jim ""Konedog"" Koenig",5,One of Clint's Top Westerns,1126396800,"09 11, 2005",2005,2852,"['was', 'still', 'star', 'hero', 'long-running', 'TV', 'western', 'Wagon', 'Train', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'emerged', 'Hollywood', 'scene', 'western-theme', 'movies', 'specifically', 'trio', 'spaghetti', 'westerns', 'director', 'Sergi', 'Leone', 'best', 'being', 'Good', 'Bad', 'Ugly', '.After', 'establishing', 'remarkable', 'character', 'Dirty', 'Harry', 'Clint', 'western', 'roots', 'vengeful', 'Josie', 'Wales', 'Outlaw', 'Josie', 'Wales', 'Clint', '31st', 'film', 'fifth', 'director', 'Actually', 'film', 'was', 'started', 'different', 'director', 'Philip', 'Kaufman', 'Right', 'Stuff', 'fame', 'numerous', 'intractable', 'arguments', 'interpretation', 'film', 'Clint', 'fired', 'director', 'week', 'shooting', 'took', 'over', 'directorship', 'will', 'never', 'know', 'what', 'sort', 'film', 'Mr.', 'Kaufman', 'would', 'have', 'produced', 'Eastwood', 'final', 'product', 'true', 'gem', 'western', 'filmmaking.In', 'Eastwood', 'western', 'trilogy', 'was', 'known', 'only', 'man', 'name', 'loner', 'who', 'generously', 'dispensed', 'form', 'western', 'justice', 'barrel', 'gun', 'two', 'was', 'not', 'much', 'character', 'development', 'do', ""n't"", 'learn', 'what', 'man', 'what', 'inside', 'Josie', 'Wales', 'Clint', 'new', 'ground', 'emotions', 'vengeful', 'Wales', 'insights', 'character', 'feelings', 'Wales', 'man', 'name', 'AND', 'feelings', 'movie', 'more', 'mere', 'shoot', 'up', 'depth', 'meaning', 'film', 'Eastwood', 'much', 'same', 'more', '1990', 'blockbuster', 'last', 'western', 'Unforgiven', 'Oscar', 'results.Josie', 'Wales', 'can', 'be', 'viewed', 'interest', 'pleasure', 'several', 'different', 'levels', 'course', 'vengeful', 'man', 'theme', 'movie', 'backbone', 'Then', 'multi-cultural', 'theme', 'where', 'instead', 'going', 'alone', 'one', 'man', 'many', 'Wales', 'collection', 'family', 'movie', 'old', 'Indian', 'Chief', 'talkative', 'Indian', 'Squaw', 'grandmother', 'granddaughter', 'Sandra', 'Locke', 'whom', 'Clint', 'would', 'have', 'affair', 'would', 'end', 'marriage', 'wife', 'Maggie', 'finally', 'collection', 'townies', 'dying', 'silver', 'mining', 'town', 'Finally', 'healing', 'theme', 'namely', 'how', 'man', 'who', 'violent', 'loss', 'wife', 'son', 'home', 'deal', 'vengeful', 'anger', 'emotional', 'loss', 'begin', 'heal.Mere', 'trivia', 'interesting', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'never', 'once', 'shoots', 'Native', 'American', 'Indian', 'western', 'films', 'Instead', 'battling', 'indians', 'do', 'most', 'other', 'western', 'film', 'stars', 'Eastwood', 'charcters', 'build', 'alliances', 'Natives', 'learning', 'live', 'peaceful', 'co-existance', 'rather', 'state', 'perpetual', 'war.Clearly', 'Eastwood', 'best', 'western', 'up', 'point', 'career', 'definately', 'worth', 'look', 'guess', 'will', 'become', 'one', 'favorite', 'westerns.Jim', 'Konedog', 'Koenig']",N/A
233574,AGKPTMTR3UX1R,6300269043,"Konrei ""Everything I need is right here""","[0, 0]","SPOILERS INCLUDEDAs both Director and Actor, Clint Eastwood transcended his colorful persona as a hero of Spaghetti Westerns in this 1976 classic, deemed a ""culturally significant"" entry into the National Film Registry of the Library of Congress. Intelligent, taking itself seriously, though never grim, and with flashes of warmth and humor, this film is a must-see experience.THE OUTLAW JOSEY WALES opens at some time during the ""Border War"" Era of 1854 and 1861, when Pro-Slavery Missourians and Kansas Free-Soilers did battle over the eventual ""Slave or Free?"" fate of the Kansas Territory. This pre-Civil War Civil War was bitter, bloody, and intensely personal, all the more so for being telescoped into a small geographic area. Both Missouri and Kansas maintained rival governments. Internal strife was common (Lawrence Kansas was burned by Pro-Slavery elements from Lecompton the ""other"" capital), and cross-border raids consumed innocent lives.And so we are introduced to Josey Wales, a Missouri farmer who is working his land alone in happy domesticity with his pretty wife and young son. There is no evidence that Wales is a slaveowner (and in fact, the film's only real flaw is that African-Americans do not figure in the story at all).Interestingly, the ""real"" Josey Wales was a Missouri man named Wilson, the alias Wales uses at one point in the film, though whether this is coincidental is never addressed.One bright afternoon, Josey Wales returns from his fields to discover a gang of Kansas raiders, the Redlegs, burning his farmstead. They rape his wife before his eyes and kill his son. He is struck down by Terrell, the leader of the raiding party, who slashes him with a sword, leaving him for dead.Burying his family the next day, he is found by a group of Missourians led by Fletcher (John Vernon), who promise him vengeance for his family. Wales rides with them. A montage of raids progresses into a montage of Civil War battles, ending with Fletcher's calling his men together to announce that Lee has surrendered at Appomattox, and that they have been offered amnesty. What no one realizes is that Fletcher has been bribed to bring his men in. What Fletcher does not realize is that he will be surrendering to now- Captain Terrell of the Union Army. Josey Wales refuses to surrender. When the others do, they are shot down by Terrell, leaving only Fletcher alive. This scene begs the question of whether such occurrences were frequent, but that they occurred at all is certainly possible.Josey Wales rides off with a price on his head. pursued by Terrell's men and Fletcher, who is trying to save him. Although Wales wishes to be left in isolation he quickly picks up traveling companions---first, a fellow Confederate who dies of his wounds, then Chief Lone Watie (Chief Dan George), a Cherokee Indian who tells Wales, ""I didn't surrender neither, but they captured my horse and made him surrender."" Shortly thereafter, they rescue a Navajo girl, Moonlight, from being raped. The three are joined by a mangy dog.As they all head south toward Mexico, they hear growing rumors of Wales' fearsomeness---he has killed twenty men, then sixty---and is being sought  throughout the region not only by Terrell and Fletcher, but by Union soldiers and bounty hunters. For his part, Josey Wales just wishes to meet his fate alone, but at heart a decent man, he cannot bring himself to abandon his ragtag ""family."" This ""family"" soon grows again, as he makes the acquaintance of Lorelei (Sondra Locke, with whom Eastwood was to have a very long relationship starting during this picture) and her crabby old grandmother, whom he rescues from a gang of thieves. Although overly opinionated Grandma is a Jayhawker whose deceased son fought with the Redlegs, she invites Josey and his company to share in the good life awaiting them at her son's now-abandoned Crooked River Ranch.Unfortunately, Wales cannot outride his past. Although he makes peace with the Comanche war chief Ten Bears, he is found by Terrell and Fletcher, and must settle old scores---and heal old scars.At 2 1/2 hours THE OUTLAW JOSEY WALES is an epic. Violent, but never gratuitous, the film paints a realistic portrait of an era of confusion and dislocation. The movie's sympathetic portrayal of differing groups overcoming that which divides them to work together, and it's innate message of tolerance, is powerful and comes straight out of the bookGone to Texas, written by Forrest Carter (Carter was a Klansman who was drummed out of that organization for decency---Eastwood claims not to have known this while making the movie).All in all, the message is that we can change, grow and live happily together, if not forever after then at least for as long as we are given.",5,"""I owe him that.""",1280102400,"07 26, 2010",2010,4757,"['SPOILERS',

Wyatt ""ssintrepid""","[29, 33]","As stated above, ""The Outlaw Josey Wales"" is one of the genres finest films to ever grace the silver screen and the home theater!  This Western masterpiece deserved a great DVD with as much on it as was possible to have and that goal was achieved!  I wanted the DVD but also more or less had to replace the VHS copy I had due to the fact that this fine film is quite well worth repeated viewings and the good old VHS tape just didn't hold up!  Off additional note with this DVD is the widescreen format.  Obviously I've watched this classic many times, but with this DVD I was highly impressed seeing it for the first time in this format.  It ""almost"" gives one the impression of seeing it for the first time.Not only is this film blessed with Clint Eastwood in the lead role, due to differences in opinion with the original director, it is directed by him as well.  Clint Eastwood, who is inarguably one of the best in the genre, fills both roles flawlessly!  Along for the ride and to counterbalance Clint Eastwood's role as the gruff gunslinger is Chief Dan George.  His character brought comedic relief and a more realistic portrayal of a Native American, which wasn't done often in films produced at the time this one was.  One thing is for certain when viewing a Clint Eastwood western, you the viewer are always in for a great ride!The premise:Clint Eastwood plays Josey Wales, a poor Missouri farmer who is trying to make a living and take care of his family while the Civil War rages on.  Unfortunately for his character the war comes to his front door when Kansas irregulars known as the ""Red Legs"" brutally attack and kill his wife and child as he bears witness.  Not long after burying his wife and child he meets up with other southerners who form a guerilla group.  They immediately head off to start guerilla type attacks against northern troops.  Of course the south loses the war and these groups are ordered to turn themselves in.  Josey Wales chooses not to turn himself in and his fear of doing so bears out.  What follows from this point is, as stated above, one of the finest westerns to ever grace the silver screen.Special Features:Of all of the special features available on this DVD there are a couple that are quite worthy of extra mention.  The 1976 Documentary ""Eastwood in Action"" and the 1999 Documentary ""Hell Hath No Fury:  The Making of The Outlaw Josey Wales"".  Both are quite well done and highly informative.I highly recommend this film to all who are into this genre or those who are looking for something different and quite genuine!

It was an engrossing and entertaining movie, and, unlike others in this genre, it is an intelligent and well thought out film.The film tells the story of a Missouri farmer who, towards the end of the Civil War, finds his home overrun by renegade union soldiers who set fire to his homestead, kill his wife and son, and leave him for dead. After burying his family, he joins a group of confederate guerillas who have suffered similar tragedies. Ultimately, the war ends and their leader brings them in for surrender, except for Josey Wales, who watches their surrender from afar. Good thing he did not join them, as their surrender turns into an execution by the very same men who had pillaged his home and killed his family.Wales escapes only to be relentlessly hunted down by the very men who had wronged him, as well as by bounty hunters who want that five thousand dollar reward offered for his capture. Wales rides on to escape them, and along his travels acquires a motley entourage whom he befriends and who befriend him. What happens on his journey is classic Eastwood.Clint Eastwood plays his role as a stoic man of few words, while Chief Dan George is an absolute delight as part of Wales' entourage. The rest of the cast is uniformly excellent. Of course, Sandra Locke, as Eastwood's real life main squeeze at the time, got star billing, even though her role was one of the smaller ones and her performance the least impressive of the supporting cast.This remains one of the more entertaining films in this genre.

233585,A2EOCDPEG6K1WQ,6300269043,Mark Lahren,"[8, 8]","First off, since Amazon appears to have grouped the reviews for two different DVD editions of this movie together, the one I am reviewing here has the brown cover with a picture of a very angry Eastwood wielding two pistols. It also has ""CLINT EASTWOOD COLLECTION"" printed across the top.Others here have reviewed this top-notch movie better than I could, so I'll just give my impressions of the quality of this release.I don't know how many different DVD versions of this movie were ever released, but as far as I'm concerned, this is the best one, with remastered audio and video. The sound quality is simply superb--I have many DVD movies, and this one is by far the best, both in terms of audio and video quality. Considering it comes in the flimsier fold-out cardboard flap over plastic case, I was surprised at how good the quality of the actual disk is. The picture quality is simply stunning; I don't know how else to adequately describe it. It's the widescreen ""letterbox"" format, which gives you the entire theater screen including the left and right sides that fullscreen releases chop off in order to fill up the whole screen. Letterbox is the only way to go if you want to see the entire wide picture you get at the theater. Most of you already know this; I only mention it because I know there are still some who do not. This release is dual-layer format and is enhanced for widescreen TVs. The movie itself runs 2 hours and 15 minutes. Special features: Soundtrack remastered in Dolby Digital 5.1. 1976 Documentary ""Eastwood In Action"" (approx. 8 minutes). 1999 Documentary ""Hell Hath No Fury: The Making Of The Outlaw Josey Wales"" (approx. 30 minutes and a fascinating look behind the scenes including documentary footage from the making of the movie showing Eastwood in the act of directing). A very brief introduction to the movie itself by Clint Eastwood (approx. 1 minute). Subtitles in English, French, and Spanish. Languages in English and French. Production notes. Theatrical trailer. Scene Access.Again, I cannot stress how good this edition looks and sounds. Even the darkest scenes are vivid and clear. Image throughout the film is extremely crisp. A very slight pause midway as the player switches layers, but that's normal with the Dual-Layer format, and it was hardly noticeable.

All his characters possess an inner strength that rings true whether he impersonates a Cop (Dirty Harry, 1971), a Boxing trainer (Million Dollar Baby 2004) or an Outlaw as in this film.The film ""The Outlaw Josey Wales"" (1976) tells the story of Josey, a farmer in the late years of the Civil War that has his farm burnt and his family massacred by Northern irregulars.They thought him dead and went away. Big mistake! Josey will turn himself into a sharpshooter and join Southern guerilla until war's end.His party is talked into surrender by a well-meaning Southerner. They are betrayed and put to death by the same evil-doers of the past encounter.From here on Josey is in permanent flight with no respite. In his way to Texas he collects an odd bunch of followers: an old Indian chief, a squaw, a tiny old lady and her daughter. Bounty hunters and the stubborn ex-guerrilla changed into ""lawful enforcers"" are after his trail and won't give up till the bitter end.It amaze me how similar environments, as USA Southwest and Argentinean pampas (flatlands) produce similar characters: shrewd, not given to useless talk, with a deep sense of justice, endurance and single-mindedness. These entire traits are present in Josey as in our most famous literary outlaw: the Gaucho Martin Fierro.Eastwood as film director has incorporated the best traits of Sergio Leone's spaghetti-western and spin them to higher level of credibility and compromise.As an actor he gives here a very solid acting piece.  Chief Dan George as Lone Watie and Paula Trueman as Grandma Sarah are great and expressive in a very different, but effective way.The rest of the cast is supportive with no low points.It is an excellent movie that will be enjoyed by westerner's fan and general audience.Reviewed by Max Yofre.",5,Spit in your Enemy's Eye!,1113609600,"04 16, 2005",2005,1867,"[""'m"", 'always', 'fascinated', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'roles', 'director', 'actor', 'characters', 'possess', 'inner', 'strength', 'true', 'Cop', 'Dirty', 'Harry', '1971', 'Boxing', 'trainer', 'Million', 'Dollar', 'Baby', '2004', 'Outlaw', 'film.The', 'film', 'Outlaw', 'Josey', 'Wales', '1976', 'story', 'Josey', 'farmer', 'late', 'years', 'Civil', 'War', 'farm', 'burnt', 'family', 'massacred', 'Northern', 'irregulars.They', 'thought', 'dead', 'went', 'away', 'Big', 'mistake', 'Josey', 'will', 'turn', 'sharpshooter', 'join', 'Southern', 'guerilla', 'war', 'end.His', 'party', 'talked', 'surrender', 'well-meaning', 'Southerner', 'are', 'betrayed', 'put', 'death', 'same', 'evil-doers', 'past', 'encounter.From', 'here', 'Josey', 'permanent', 'flight', 'respite', 'way', 'Texas', 'odd', 'bunch', 'followers', 'old', 'Indian', 'chief', 'squaw', 'tiny', 'old', 'lady', 'daughter', 'Bounty', 'hunters', 'stubborn', 'ex-guerrilla', 'changed', 'lawful', 'enforcers', 'are', 'trail', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'up', 'till', 'bitter', 'end.It', 'how', 'similar', 'environments', 'USA', 'Southwest', 'Argentinean', 'pampas', 'flatlands', 'produce', 'similar', 'characters', 'shrewd', 'not', 'given', 'useless', 'talk', 'deep', 'sense', 'justice', 'endurance', 'single-mindedness', 'entire', 'traits', 'are', 'present', 'Josey', 'most', 'famous', 'literary', 'outlaw', 'Gaucho', 'Martin', 'Fierro.Eastwood', 'film', 'director', 'incorporated', 'best', 'traits', 'Sergio', 'Leone', 'spaghetti-western', 'spin', 'higher', 'level', 'credibility', 'compromise.As', 'actor', 'here', 'very', 'solid', 'acting', 'piece', 'Chief', 'Dan', 'George', 'Lone', 'Watie', 'Paula', 'Trueman', 'Grandma', 'Sarah', 'are', 'great', 'expressive', 'very', 'different', 'effective', 'way.The', 'rest', 'cast', 'supportive', 'low', 'points.It', 'excellent', 'movie', 'will', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'westerner', 'fan', 'general', 'audience.Reviewed', 'Max', 'Yofre']",N/A

Not having seen or remembered much about the film, I decided to take another look.  In a brief introduction, director and star Clint Eastwood says he believes this to be perhaps his best film.  I might have to agree.A decade removed from his ""Man With No Name"" trilogy, Eastwood stars as a Missouri rebel at the end of the Civil War.  Marauding Northern troops, kill his wife and child in the opening scene setting the stage for Josey Wales revenge and it won't be pretty.  Wales signs on with a rag tag group of Southerners who are promised amnesty if the will swear allegiance to the United States.  Josey refuses to go along, eventually witnessing the slaughter of his former gang.  Now as an outlaw he escapes heading south toward Texas, closely followed by his former leader, Fletcher (John Vernon) and the Union leader, ""Red Legged"" Terrill (Bill McKinney), the man who murdered his family.Rather than going it alone as his characters have done in the past, Eastwood's Wales picks up some unlikely companions along the way.  Most importantly is Lone Watie, a onetime Indian chief played with vigor and great humor by Chief Dan George.  Another is Little Moonlight (Geraldine Kearns), a young Indian woman saved from rape by Wales.  In west Texas, the trio rescue a family of Kansans, headed to a small town settled by another family member.  Among this group is Laura Lee played by Sandra Locke.As a footnote, this is where the Locke-Eastwood romance began.  It lasted through several more movies together until their bitter separation in 1989.  Another surprise is the PG rating.  The movie has much violence, none of which is terribly graphic.  What is however, is the near gang rape of a stripped Laura Lee.  There's also the near fully clothed rape of Little Moonlight by 2 hulking trappers and a little one-on-one consenting sex between the aforementioned Moonlight and Lone Watie.In addition to a fine performance by Eastwood, his direction is spot on.  An excellent script by Phillip Kaufman and Sonia Chernus comes from Forrest Carter's book, ""Gone To Texas.""  A character unto itself is the western filming locations in mostly Utah and Arizona, beautifully shot by the great Bruce Surtees.  Finally, a wonderful score by Jerry Fielding rounds out one of the best Westerns of the modern era.",5,Perhaps Clint Eastwood's best film,1370908800,"06 11, 2013",2013,2448,"['Director', 'James', 'Mangold', 'who', 'helmed', 'upcoming', 'Marvel', 'release', 'Wolverine', 'Outlaw', 'Josie', 'Wales', 'primary', 'inspiration', 'Not', 'having', 'seen', 'remembered', 'much', 'film', 'decided', 'take', 'look', 'brief', 'introduction', 'director', 'star', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'be', 'perhaps', 'best', 'film', 'might', 'have', 'agree.A', 'decade', 'removed', 'Man', 'Name', 'trilogy', 'Eastwood', 'Missouri', 'rebel', 'end', 'Civil', 'War', 'Marauding', 'Northern', 'troops', 'kill', 'wife', 'child', 'opening', 'scene', 'setting', 'stage', 'Josey', 'Wales', 'revenge', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'pretty', 'Wales', 'signs', 'rag', 'tag', 'group', 'Southerners', 'who', 'are', 'promised', 'amnesty', 'will', 'swear', 'allegiance', 'United', 'States', 'Josey', 'go', 'along', 'eventually', 'witnessing', 'slaughter', 'former', 'gang', 'Now', 'outlaw', 'heading', 'south', 'Texas', 'closely', 'followed', 'former', 'leader', 'Fletcher', 'John', 'Vernon', 'Union', 'leader', 'Red', 'Legged', 'Terrill', 'Bill', 'McKinney', 'man', 'who', 'murdered', 'family.Rather', 'going', 'alone', 'characters', 'have', 'done', 'past', 'Eastwood', 'Wales', 'up', 'unlikely', 'companions', 'way', 'Most', 'importantly', 'Lone', 'Watie', 'onetime', 'Indian', 'chief', 'played', 'vigor', 'great', 'humor', 'Chief', 'Dan', 'George', 'Little', 'Moonlight', 'Geraldine', 'Kearns', 'young', 'Indian', 'woman', 'saved', 'rape', 'Wales', 'west', 'Texas', 'trio', 'family', 'Kansans', 'headed', 'small', 'town', 'settled', 'family', 'member', 'group', 'Laura', 'Lee', 'played', 'Sandra', 'Locke.As', 'footnote', 'where', 'Locke-Eastwood', 'romance', 'began', 'lasted', 'several', 'more', 'movies', 'together', 'bitter', 'separation', '1989', 'surprise', 'PG', 'rating', 'movie', 'much', 'violence', 'none', 'terribly', 'graphic', 'What', 'however', 'near', 'gang', 'rape', 'stripped', 'Laura', 'Lee', 'also', 'near', 'fully', 'clothed', 'rape', 'Little', 'Moonlight', '2', 'hulking', 'trappers', 'little', 'one-on-one', 'consenting', 'sex', 'aforementioned', 'Moonlight', 'Lone', 'Watie.In', 'addition', 'fine', 'performance', 'Eastwood', 'direction', 'spot', 'excellent', 'script', 'Phillip', 'Kaufman', 'Sonia', 'Chernus', 'Forrest', 'Carter', 'book', 'Gone', 'Texas', 'character', 'western', 'filming', 'locations', 'mostly', 'Utah', 'Arizona', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'great', 'Bruce', 'Surtees', 'Finally', 'wonderful', 'score', 'Jerry', 'Fielding', 'out', 'one', 'best', 'Westerns', 'modern', 'era']",N/A

233606,A18SDN3HYFVH2L,6300269043,Muzzlehatch,"[8, 8]","When I first saw ""The Outlaw Josey Wales"", probably the first couple of times, I saw it the way I'd expect that a lot of young people in the 1980s, the first ""video"" generation, saw it - a great funny action movie that could provide a larger number of potential drinking games than just about any film you could think of: take a drink whenever Josie (Clint Eastwood) spits tobacco; take a drink whenever Josey kills someone; take a drink whenever anybody utters the words ""Josey Wales"", whenever Josey says ""I reckon"" or ""reckon so"", etc. And it's absolutely possible and acceptable to me to watch the movie with that sort of fun-movie mentality. Philip Kaufman's screenplay, from Forrest Carter's novel, takes full advantage of the opportunities for fun and Eastwood doesn't shy away from the broad comedy and ""cool"" lines.But gradually over the years I've come to see this Civil War revenge and redemption story as something a lot more than just a movie full of quotable lines and great action sequences - it's the film that first signalled that Eastwood was potentially a master, and one interested in more than just mindless violence and coolness. ""Josey Wales"" begins with a scene of pastoral, homey tranquility - a Missouri farmer with his young son plowing the ground under a beautiful autumn sun (the opening shot is one of the nicest in Eastwood's filmography), his angelic wife appearing dream-like in a dappled glade, telling the son to come wash up - and then tragedy strikes. In minutes, Josey's dreams and whole life are shattered, and he becomes a man bent on vengeance against the ""redlegs"" (Union-sympathizing raiders) who have killed his family and burned his home. He learns to shoot, and he joins up with a band of marauders headed by Fletcher (John Vernon).All of this happens in the pre-credits sequence. During that montage as the screen goes to a blue-tinted, unsaturated look the exploits of Fletcher's guerilla warriors are shown; by the time it ends and we get to the film proper, they're over as is the war. We also hear for the first time Jerry Fielding's magnificent score, one of the greatest in American film history, in its wonderful drum-and-fife mode redolent of old Civil War marching tunes. Josey has grown a beard to partially cover the scar he suffered being attacked by the redlegs, and he has clearly become a fearsome gunfighter, and Fletcher has decided, as leader of the last band of holdouts, hungry and on the run and hopeless, to surrender. His men follow suit.But Josey won't surrender, which turns out to be a good call on his part as his comrades are butchered by what turn out to be more redlegs under the command of Terrill (Bill McKinney), the same man who had commanded the raid on Josey's farm. Josey rides into the camp as the massacre is beginning and manages to kill a large number of the soldiers with a commandeered Gatling gun but his group are all dead except for the seriously wounded young Jamie (Sam Bottoms) and Fletcher, who has been pressed into Union service after unwittingly betraying his men. Josie rescues Jamie, swears vengeance on Fletcher and Terrill, and rides away, planning first to head to Indian Territory where he thinks he can get help for Jamie.And the rest of the film becomes an event-filled journey towards Texas or Mexico (it's often not clear what, if any, final destination Josey has in mind) as Josey finds and loses companions, becoming bound up in a gradual community of similarly lost souls with him as the restless, never-named leader. Jamie doesn't make it very far but Josey soon gains an old Cheyenne, Lone Watie (the absolutely amazing Chief Dan George) as his most faithful companion and it's soon apparent that his actual vengeance will keep taking a back seat as he takes care of and fights for the growing surrogate family of misfits that eventually come to make a home on a deserted ranch in Texas. Finally in the last third of the movie, after making peace with the Comanche chief, Ten Bears (Will Sampson), it seems that Josie and his little community will have peace, and Josie himself seems on the verge of losing his desire to keep up the fight, but the redlegs have pursued and there must be one last showdown...As I mentioned in the first paragraph, this is one of those great mixtures of comedy, action and drama that one can easily appreciate on a very simple level - there are very few westerns with more memorable dialogue -- but that for me at least keeps growing in depth and feeling. Josey doesn't say too much, most of the time, but his interactions with Lone Watie are always amusing and sometimes hilarious; he inverts the typical convention of the stoic Indian here by having his two main native characters (the other, Little Moonlisht, a young woman who Josey rescues from being enslaved by two trappers at a trading post) talkative and expressive while the white hero is taciturn and sullen much of the time. And Josey's way with guns is always impressive and also frequently engenders humor, as when he explains the order of shooting to Lone Watie after a gunfight in a small town where Josie was surprised by four Union soldiers (a bit of dialogue referenced to darker effect in ""Unforgiven""). The story that's being told, though, belies the lighter tone of much of the early part of the film, and this is what sticks with me the most after a half-dozen viewings.Much is said of Eastwood's two primary and obvious influences, particularly on the western and action elements in his career - Sergio Leone and Don Siegel - but here the presiding spirit is clearly John Ford, and amazingly enough in only his second western and fifth film as director, Clint manages to make something that approaches the best of that master's work. The Ford themes of the individual struggling to be both part of the new west of community and family and the lone frontiersman, and the ambivalent relations between races in ""The Searchers"" are reflected in ""Josey Wales""; there's a shot of Josey in the bright doorway of the dark trading post that seems like a direct homage, and Josey's inability to give up his vengeful anger despite having a home, a community, and even a love interest are certainly reminiscent of Ethan Edwards' inner turmoil. And Eastwood and cinematographer Bruce Surtees' feeling for the land and the light are impeccable and have a ""classic"", unforced beauty that might be unbeaten in the director's work. I already mentioned the score, which at various times evokes Copland (the sequence where Josey and company first wander into a town sounds strikingly like the ""Hoedown"" section of Rodeo though it's the Josey Wales theme reiterated again) and at others the kinds of old Gospel and popular tunes that populate Ford's work.But I don't mean to make it sound as if the film is particularly derivative, either; certainly the level of violence in the film is very much 1970s; the cynical and nihilistic attitude of Josey himself is at a remove from Wayne's Ethan Edwards, or any Ford character I can think of; and the dusty and decrepit western towns and the dark interior lighting certainly are more ""modern"", not at all ""classic Hollywood"" and would become themselves Eastwood trademarks. And the travelogue feeling and the unhurried pacing are also typical of the director's style; few western directors are as willing to allow their main ""action"" storyline take a back seat so often, and so willing to build to a climax in which the outcome really does remain uncertain up to the very end. Josey may be an extraordinary gunfighter but he's not the Man With No Name - he is a widower, a Missourian, a troubled and flawed man, and at the end we can't be certain in fact whether he will live to see the happiness which, finally, he seems willing to allow himself.There are some small faults - the oft-derided Sondra Locke isn't in my opinion terrible, but she certainly doesn't bring anything to the film that any number of better actresses wouldn't have - thankfully her role is fairly small; and though I like the resolution more all the time, still I think the pacing in the last act is a little too unhurried even for a lover of films that take their own sweet time. But these are minor issues in a remarkable film that gathers all kinds of disparate influences and emotional elements - from Mark Twain, to Ford, to Siegel, Civil War to frontier, from broad comedy to Leone-esque stylized violence and finally to a deserved sentimentality and feeling that few of Eastwood's contemporaries can carry off without getting maudlin or trying for an unneeded transcendence.",5,Eastwood's first masterpiece as director and the finest western of the 1970s,1252886400,"09 14, 2009",2009,8600,"['When', 'first', 'saw', 'Outlaw', 'Josey', 'Wales', 'probably',

233607,A1QQPIUXWD4G0Z,6300269043,Octavius,"[5, 6]","This moving western was directed by Clint Eastwood and is one of the best westerns ever made. Clint Eastwood himself considers this film to be one of his personal favorites: one of the crowning achievements of his career.  The film is well balanced in every aspect: it has a great script, good direction, excellent cinematography, and strong acting.The film follows the life of Josey Wales, a simple farmer in the South during the Civil War whose family is brutally murdered by the pillaging Redlegs: irregular Union cavalry contingents who terrorized Confederate civilians and carried out rear actions against the Confederate army.  Vowing revenge, Wales joins the Confederate cavalry to hunt down the Redlegs.  Refusing to surrender at the end of the war, Wales becomes a fugitive and heads west. Still hunting for his persecutors, Josey draws an old Cherokee Chief (Chief Dan George), a squaw, and a scrawny dog as odd companions on his journeys.  He eventually tries to settle down with a new love (Sandra Locke) but his past comes back to find him for a final showdown.This western explores various themes.  It's primarily a deep character study about what someone has to do when they've been wronged with the worst injustices.  How the just are often branded as outlaws by criminals who assume the cloak of justice. The film also touches on socio-political themes particular to American history and the West; the travesty of the Civil War and how the Union was as much a monster as the Confederacy (i.e. the red legs, reconstruction, carpetbaggers and opportunists.) Chief Dan George delivers a particularly memorable and moving performance as the sneaky and philosophical Cherokee who tags along with Josey Wales.One of the finest westerns that has a lot of insight and warmth.

When the soldiers exhaust and decide to pledge their adherence to the Union, Joey Wales stays behind, and sees that the Redlegs have set them up. As each of the men are being shot down, Josey rides in a kills off many Redlegs and flees. With a price on his head, he rides in the direction of Texas, fighting off anyone who stands in his way.Also directed by Clint Eastwood, ""The Outlaw Josey Wales"" is a lengthy and often tedious post-civil war western. It contains exciting (yet brutal) shootouts and situations, and is supported with a very likeable performance by Chief Dan George, who plays an introspective indigenous fellow and Sondra Locke.

In another scene, a scumbag corners Wales inside a trading post and grunts with pleasure, ""Five-thousand gold simoleons walked right in, right to us.""  Clint Eastwood, who portrays Wales, guns them all down.  Eastwood has made a career of meting out justice on his own terms, and as movie-goers we love it.  Don't mess with Clint.Post Civil War America as portrayed in ""The Outlaw Josey Wales"" is particularly brutal and brutalized, made callous by the carnage of a long and gruesome war.  Wales, a southerner, sees his family killed by ""Red Legs"" (Yankee vigilantes) and joins a group of Rebel vigilantes to exact revenge.  The war ends but the carnage continues.  The Rebel vigilantes are tricked into surrendering and are gunned down, while Wales escapes and becomes a hunted man.  Everywhere he travels he encounters mindless brutality.  Eastwood, who directed the movie, sees to it that the brutalizers are deliciously low and mean-spirited, so that when Wales guns them down we rejoice.As the movie builds to a showdown with the Red-Legs thugs, Wales gathers around him a circle of survivors who replace the family he lost in the war: an old Cherokee who wears a stovepipe hat like Abraham Lincoln, a Navajo squaw who is not as helpless as we first believe, an old woman from Kansas and her granddaughter (who becomes Wales' love interest), and a hapless red hound on which Wales spits tobacco juice (not to discriminate, Wales spits on his victims as well).Inside Wales' adopted family, all is harmony and mutual respect.  Outside Wales' circle, the world is callous and life is cheap.  It seems everybody is out to steal what isn't nailed down, rape the weak, and kill at the drop of a hat.  The indian squaw is saved from gang-rape when Wales happens along.  The old woman and her granddaughter are captured by a gang of unsavory characters who sell whiskey to the indians, and who think nothing of killing the menfolk and selling the women into white slavery.  Wales guns down the unsavory characters in a scene that is as amusing as it is violent.Wales and his companions settle down on a ranch near Santa Rio, Texas, where they are menaced first by Comanches and finally by the Red-Legs thugs.  Wales makes peace with the Comanches, who are shown to be honorable people who have been hoodwinked once too often by the duplicitous U.S. Army.  There's no dealing with the determined Red-Legs devils, however.  With help from his extended family, Wales guns them down.

Rottentomatoes.com has a perfect 100% score on the critics ""Tomatometer"" with Roger Ebert stating, "" Eastwood is such a taciturn and action-oriented performer that it's easy to overlook the fact that he directs many of his movies -- and many of the best, most intelligent ones. Here, with the moody, gloomily beautiful photography of Bruce Surtees, he creates a magnificent Western feeling.""  It was also one of the few Western movies to receive critical and commercial success in the 70's at a time when the Western was thought to be dying as a major genre in Hollywood.  Orson Welles while on Merv Griffin and Johnny Carson proclaimed Josey Wales the best Western ever made and admitted to seeing it over 4 times!!!  Jerry Fielding was nominated for an Oscar in the best motion picture score category.  In 1996, this film was placed in the United States Library of Congress and selected for preservation in their National Film Registry.

(Five years earlier, he launched his career as a director with Play Misty for Me in which he also starred.) This is one of my favorites among Eastwood's several dozen films because it combines very effectively so many elements of a great story: historical significance, a crisp but unpredictable plot, generally excellent acting, a substantial element of humor, all manner of conflicts and tensions, magnificent scenery, and lots of action. By then (1976), Eastwood had also developed his skill at creating moments of intimacy and tenderness between and among the actors he directed (his interaction with Chief Dan George is especially effective) and is in top form near the end of the film when he finally avenges the deaths of his family members and Confederate comrades, only to be confronted with the possibility of being arrested to stand trial, be convicted, and then imprisoned, if not hanged. The scene in the barren barroom is brief but indelible. I agree with others who are critical of Sondra Locke's acting, not only in this film but in several others. She plays a skittish, jittery, self-conscious young woman named Laura Lee. Fortunately, she has no greater significance in the narrative than do the furniture in the cabin and the wagon that hauled it. What Eastwood accomplishes in Unforgiven (1992) probably would not have been possible had he not developed his skills as a director in this film and in Pale Rider (1985). In my opinion, the best of Eastwood's work as a director of westerns is the equal of Ford and Hawks in their prime.",5,A Western Classic,1056412800,"06 24, 2003",2003,1692,"['Unhappy', 'director', 'Eastwood', 'replaced', 'while', 'continuing', 'lead', 'what', 'proven', 'be', 'one', 'most', 'entertaining', 'films', 'Five', 'years', 'earlier', 'launched', 'career', 'director', 'Play', 'Misty', 'Me', 'also', 'starred', 'one', 'favorites', 'Eastwood', 'several', 'dozen', 'films', 'very', 'effectively', 'so', 'many', 'elements', 'great', 'story', 'historical', 'significance', 'crisp', 'unpredictable', 'plot', 'generally', 'excellent', 'acting', 'substantial', 'element', 'humor', 'manner', 'conflicts', 'tensions', 'magnificent', 'scenery', 'lots', 'action', 'then', '1976', 'Eastwood', 'had', 'also', 'developed', 'skill', 'creating', 'moments', 'intimacy', 'tenderness', 'actors', 'directed', 'interaction', 'Chief', 'Dan', 'George', 'especially', 'effective', 'top', 'form', 'end', 'film', 'when', 'finally', 'deaths', 'family', 'members', 'Confederate', 'comrades', 'only', 'be', 'confronted', 'possibility', 'being', 'arrested', 'stand', 'trial', 'be', 'convicted', 'then', 'imprisoned', 'not', 'hanged', 'scene', 'barren', 'barroom', 'brief', 'indelible', 'agree', 'others', 'who', 'are', 'critical', 'Sondra', 'Locke', 'acting', 'not', 'only', 'film', 'several', 'others', 'skittish', 'jittery', 'self-conscious', 'young', 'woman', 'named', 'Laura', 'Lee', 'Fortunately', 'greater', 'significance', 'narrative', 'do', 'furniture', 'cabin', 'wagon', 'hauled', 'What', 'Eastwood', 'accomplishes', 'Unforgiven', '1992', 'probably', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'possible', 'had', 'not', 'developed', 'skills', 'director', 'film', 'Pale', 'Rider', '1985', 'opinion', 'best', 'Eastwood', 'work', 'director', 'westerns', 'equal', 'Ford', 'Hawks', 'prime']",N/A
233633,AGZVS6M8XJGN6,6300269043,"Roberto Frangie ""Robert""","[3, 3]","Eastwood's film had all the necessary elements to make a classic... There are in his movie a lot of thoughts about war and the victims of war... The film has the magical combination of historical fact and cowboy fantasy...The fantasy, as ever, is Eastwood... Josey Wales switches from a simple peasant farmer to stone-cold killer... His shooting becomes as precise as his tobacco spitting... Whether he is merely taking a split second to reverse the two guns he is pretending to hand over to some bounty hunters and concede some bullets instead, or whether he is decently shooting countless 'Blue Coats' with a captured machine gun, or appearing out of the sun to terrify a band of Indians into thinking he is an 'army of one,' or pulling the triggers of his empty guns over and over again, he remains superhuman and invincible... It is Eastwood's screen presence as something unique, direct and strong, the essential Eastwood persona that is a powerful attraction to the public and an enigma to the critics...Josey Wales has no desire to become an outlaw... At the beginning of the film he is a peaceable Missouri farmer whose wife and child are murdered by Unionist vigilantes, the 'Kansas Red Legs.' The film opens in 1858 when the semi-discipline of the Civil War has been reduced to the chaos of marauding private armies... Wales joins a bunch of desperate Confederate fighters led by Commander Fletcher (John Vernon), and for the next seven years intensifies a multiple revenge on the Unionists, killing them without political cause or pity...At the end of formal hostilities a price is placed on his head so he makes a picaresque journey into the Indian nation... On the way he picks up different companions: Jamie (Sam Bottoms), a young soldier he saves and who repays the favor only to die from his wounds; Lone Watie (Chief Dan George) who instructs him in the ways and thoughts of the Cherokees; Little Moonlight (Geraldine Keams), the Navajo girl who suffers injustice from the white man's civilization; Grandma Sarah (Paula Trueman), the old woman who knows how to shoot marauders, and Laura Lee (Sondra Locke), whom he rescues from a rape...After surviving the dangers of their journey under the protective wing of Josey, the group settles on a farm formerly owned by Sarah's son who has died in the war... Wales tries to pass his self-sufficient qualities onto them so that they can if necessary survive without him... He shows them how to use guns and protect the farm against invaders, and negotiates a peace with the blue-painted Navajo Chief, Ten Bears (Will Sampson).Eastwood plays a solitary figure who is not simply an avenger, or a fugitive with a gun... He is a man who at the same time defends women and children and the weak... His love affair with Laura is triggered off by such wistful sentiments as 'clouds are dreams floating across the sky of your mind,' but it rings true that a man blinkered by revenge and hardened by the sheer need to survive could be drawn to an innocent girl, able to escape from the terrors of her environment into the poetry of her reveries... This was the first of six films that Eastwood would make with Sondra Locke who has already won an Oscar nomination in her film debut 'The Heat Is a Lonely Hunter.'Chief Dan George, who received an Oscar nomination, for playing Old Lodge Skins in Arthur Penn's 'Little Big Man,' is terrific as the aging Indian warrior Lone Watie... He calls himself a civilized Indian - ""We're civilized because white men can sneak up on us.' He struck up a perfect partnership with Eastwood, sensitively timing the soft humor in their relationship... When Josey casually outdraws and kills four men, the Old Indian asks with genuine interest, 'How did you know which one to kill first?'",4,A personal tour de force for Eastwood!,1162857600,"11 7, 2006",2006,3770,"['Eastwood', 'film', 'had', 'necessary', 'elements', 'make', 'classic', 'are', 'movie', 'lot', 'thoughts', 'war', 'victims', 'war', 'film', 'magical', 'combination', 'historical', 'fact', 'cowboy', 'fantasy', 'fantasy', 'ever', 'Eastwood', 'Josey', 'Wales', 'simple', 'peasant', 'farmer', 'stone-cold', 'killer', 'shooting', 'becomes', 'as', 'precise', 'tobacco', 'spitting', 'merely', 'taking', 'split', 'second', 'reverse', 'two', 'guns', 'pretending', 'hand', 'over', 'bounty', 'hunters', 'concede', 'bullets', 'instead', 'decently', 'shooting', 'countless', ""'Blue"", 'Coats', 'captured', 'machine', 'gun', 'appearing', 'sun', 'terrify', 'band', 'Indians', 'thinking', ""'army"", 'one', 'pulling', 'triggers', 'empty', 'guns', 'over', 'again', 'superhuman', 'invincible', 'Eastwood', 'screen', 'presence', 'something', 'unique', 'direct', 'strong', 'essential', 'Eastwood', 'persona', 'powerful', 'attraction', 'public', 'enigma', 'critics', 'Josey', 'Wales', 'desire', 'become', 'outlaw', 'beginning', 'film', 'peaceable', 'Missouri', 'farmer', 'wife', 'child', 'are', 'murdered', 'Unionist', 'vigilantes', ""'Kansas"", 'Red', 'Legs', 'film', '1858', 'when', 'semi-discipline', 'Civil', 'War', 'been', 'reduced', 'chaos', 'marauding', 'private', 'armies', 'Wales', 'bunch', 'desperate', 'Confederate', 'fighters', 'led', 'Commander', 'Fletcher', 'John', 'Vernon', 'next', 'seven', 'years', 'multiple', 'revenge', 'Unionists', 'killing', 'political', 'cause', 'pity', 'end', 'formal', 'hostilities', 'price', 'placed', 'head', 'picaresque', 'journey', 'Indian', 'nation', 'way', 'up', 'different', 'companions', 'Jamie', 'Sam', 'Bottoms', 'young', 'soldier', 'who', 'repays', 'favor', 'only', 'die', 'wounds', 'Lone', 'Watie', 'Chief', 'Dan', 'George', 'who', 'ways', 'thoughts', 'Cherokees', 'Little', 'Moonlight', 'Geraldine', 'Keams', 'Navajo', 'girl', 'who', 'injustice', 'white', 'man', 'civilization', 'Grandma', 'Sarah', 'Paula', 'Trueman', 'old', 'woman', 'who', 'how', 'shoot', 'marauders', 'Laura', 'Lee', 'Sondra', 'Locke', 'whom', 'rape', 'surviving', 'dangers', 'journey', 'protective', 'wing', 'Josey', 'group', 'farm', 'formerly', 'owned', 'Sarah', 'son', 'who', 'died', 'war', 'Wales', 'pass', 'self-sufficient', 'qualities', 'so', 'can', 'necessary', 'survive', 'how', 'use', 'guns', 'protect', 'farm', 'invaders', 'peace', 'blue-painted', 'Navajo', 'Chief', 'Ten', 'Bears', 'Will', 'Sampson', '.Eastwood', 'solitary', 'figure', 'who', 'not', 'simply', 'avenger', 'fugitive', 'gun', 'man', 'who', 'same', 'time', 'women', 'children', 'weak', 'love', 'affair', 'Laura', 'triggered', 'off', 'such', 'wistful', 'sentiments', ""'clouds"", 'are', 'dreams', 'floating', 'sky', 'mind', 'true', 'man', 'blinkered', 'revenge', 'hardened', 'sheer', 'need', 'survive', 'could', 'be', 'drawn', 'innocent', 'girl', 'able', 'escape', 'terrors', 'environment', 'poetry', 'reveries', 'was', 'first', 'six', 'films', 'Eastwood', 'would', 'make', 'Sondra', 'Locke', 'who', 'already', 'won', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'film', 'debut', 'Heat', 'Lonely', 'Hunter', 'Dan', 'George', 'who', 'received', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'playing', 'Old', 'Lodge', 'Skins', 'Arthur', 'Penn', ""'Little"", 'Big', 'Man', 'terrific', 'aging', 'Indian', 'warrior', 'Lone', 'Watie', 'civilized', 'Indian', ""'re"", 'civilized', 'white', 'men', 'can', 'sneak', 'up', 'struck', 'up', 'perfect', 'partnership', 'Eastwood', 'sensitively', 'timing', 'soft', 'humor', 'relationship', 'When', 'Josey', 'casually', 'kills', 'four', 'men', 'Old', 'Indian', 'genuine', 'interest', 'did', 'know', 'one', 'kill', 'first']",N/A

233638,A2RH7ARWQSUVQV,6300269043,"Ron Braithwaite ""Hummingbird God""","[1, 3]","This film had every chance of being a great movie but lost its course somewhere along the way.  The movie, especially the last half of the movie, should have been tightened up plenty.  Because it wasn't, the movie is too long.The first part of film is excellent.  Clint Eastwood, as the poor farmer, Josie Wales, is attacked by the Yankee Red Legs who have swept in from Missouri.  He is sabered, his child killed and his wife raped and murdered. The grief-ridden Wales, buries his family, recovers his revolver from the burned-out wreckage of his home, and starts to practice.  At his low point, he is visited by Confederate guerillas under the famous ""Bloody Bill Anderson"", a man who has also lost his entire family to the Yankees.Wales is happy to join up and fights in multiple battles against the hated Federals.  As we know, however, the southern fighters are eventually driven to their knees.  Wales' small group is one of the last to consider surrender.  Most--but not the vengeful Wales--decide to accept Federal amnesty.  It is a mistake.  They are mowed down by the deceitful Union troops.With a Yankee company hot on his heels he retreats towards Texas, taking revenge on Federal troops every time he can.  By this time, of course, Wales has become one of the best and those who stand against him, die.  He meets an old Cherokee man, Lone Watie, who himself hates the Federal Government.  Together, they make an dangerous pair.  Wales rescues a Navajo woman from the hands of criminals.  She becomes a devoted, if somewhat unlikely member, of Wales new anti-Yankee band.The movie probably should have ended here with some kind of terrific climax--maybe Wales and his two comrades fighting their enemies in some kind of last-ditch stand.Unfortunately the movie doesn't end here.  Eastwood's old girlfriend and nemesis, Sandra Locke [along with her miscast mother] are introduced.  They are rebel-hating Yankees and, therefore, present the opportunity for redemption for both Wales and the women.  Artistically, it just doesn't work.  It's almost like Eastwood added an extra hour to his film just to make room for his girlfriend.  It might not be what happened but that's what it looks like.  Really a terrible shame.By the way, the old Cherokee, Lone Watie, is taken from an actual historical character.  Most members of the ""Seven Civilized Tribes"" of the Cherokee supported the Confederacy and many fought and died for the South.  Chief Stand Watie was the last Confederate general to surrender, not surrendering until 1866.People who think that Southern Secession and the Civil War were primarily about slavery must consider several things brought out by this film.  First, Missouri had relatively few slaves and slave-owning families fought for both the Union and Confederacy.  Nevertheless, Missori was one of the most violence-torn states during the War.  People fought--no quarter--against people they opposed politically, culturally and personally.  Finally, as we see with Wales, the violence became self-perpetuating.  Enough people had been injured that they fought desperaely for motives of pure revenge.Also, why is it that the vast majority of Native Americans who fought, side with the Confederacy?  Few, indeed, were slaveholders.  In my opinion, these American natives simply felt more sympatico with the laid-back, hunting, fishing Southerners.Ron Braithwaite author of novels--""Skull Rack"" and ""Hummingbird God""--on the Spanish Conquest of Mexico",5,disintegration of Missouri,1213488000,"06 15, 2008",2008,3478,"['film', 'had', 'chance', 'being', 'great', 'movie', 'lost', 'course', 'somewhere', 'way', 'movie', 'especially', 'last', 'half', 'movie', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'tightened', 'up', 'plenty', 'was', ""n't"", 'movie', 'too', 'long.The', 'first', 'part', 'film', 'excellent', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'poor', 'farmer', 'Josie', 'Wales', 'attacked', 'Yankee', 'Red', 'Legs', 'who', 'have', 'swept', 'Missouri', 'sabered', 'child', 'killed', 'wife', 'raped', 'murdered', 'grief-ridden', 'Wales', 'family', 'revolver', 'burned-out', 'wreckage', 'home', 'practice', 'low', 'point', 'visited', 'Confederate', 'guerillas', 'famous', 'Bloody', 'Bill', 'Anderson', 'man', 'who', 'also', 'lost', 'entire', 'family', 'Yankees.Wales', 'happy', 'join', 'up', 'fights', 'multiple', 'battles', 'hated', 'Federals', 'know', 'however', 'southern', 'fighters', 'are', 'eventually', 'driven', 'knees', 'Wales', 'small', 'group', 'one', 'last', 'consider', 'surrender', 'Most', 'not', 'vengeful', 'Wales', 'decide', 'accept', 'Federal', 'amnesty', 'mistake', 'are', 'mowed', 'down', 'deceitful', 'Union', 'troops.With', 'Yankee', 'company', 'hot', 'heels', 'towards', 'Texas', 'taking', 'revenge', 'Federal', 'troops', 'time', 'can', 'time', 'course', 'Wales', 'become', 'one', 'best', 'who', 'stand', 'die', 'old', 'Cherokee', 'man', 'Lone', 'Watie', 'who', 'Federal', 'Government', 'Together', 'make', 'dangerous', 'pair', 'Wales', 'Navajo', 'woman', 'hands', 'criminals', 'devoted', 'somewhat', 'unlikely', 'member', 'Wales', 'new', 'anti-Yankee', 'band.The', 'movie', 'probably', 'should', 'have', 'ended', 'here', 'kind', 'terrific', 'climax', 'maybe', 'Wales', 'two', 'comrades', 'fighting', 'enemies', 'kind', 'last-ditch', 'stand.Unfortunately', 'movie', ""n't"", 'end', 'here', 'Eastwood', 'old', 'girlfriend', 'nemesis', 'Sandra', 'Locke', '[', 'miscast', 'mother', ']', 'are', 'introduced', 'are', 'rebel-hating', 'Yankees', 'therefore', 'present', 'opportunity', 'redemption', 'Wales', 'women', 'Artistically', 'just', ""n't"", 'work', 'almost', 'like', 'Eastwood', 'added', 'extra', 'hour', 'film', 'just', 'make', 'room', 'girlfriend', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'what', 'happened', 'what', 'Really', 'terrible', 'shame.By', 'way', 'old', 'Cherokee', 'Lone', 'Watie', 'taken', 'actual', 'historical', 'character', 'Most', 'members', 'Seven', 'Civilized', 'Tribes', 'Cherokee', 'supported', 'Confederacy', 'many', 'fought', 'died', 'South', 'Chief', 'Stand', 'Watie', 'was', 'last', 'Confederate', 'general', 'surrender', 'not', 'surrendering', '1866.People', 'who', 'think', 'Southern', 'Secession', 'Civil', 'War', 'were', 'primarily', 'slavery', 'must', 'consider', 'several', 'things', 'brought', 'out', 'film', 'First', 'Missouri', 'had', 'relatively', 'few', 'slaves', 'slave-owning', 'families', 'fought', 'Union', 'Confederacy', 'Nevertheless', 'Missori', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'violence-torn', 'states', 'War', 'People', 'fought', 'quarter', 'people', 'opposed', 'politically', 'culturally', 'personally', 'Finally', 'see', 'Wales', 'violence', 'became', 'self-perpetuating', 'Enough', 'people', 'had', 'been', 'injured', 'fought', 'desperaely', 'motives', 'pure', 'revenge.Also', 'why', 'vast', 'majority', 'Native', 'Americans', 'who', 'fought', 'side', 'Confederacy', 'Few', 'indeed', 'were', 'slaveholders', 'opinion', 'American', 'natives', 'simply', 'felt', 'more', 'sympatico', 'laid-back', 'hunting', 'fishing', 'Southerners.Ron', 'Braithwaite', 'author', 'novels', 'Skull', 'Rack', 'Hummingbird', 'God', 'Spanish', 'Conquest', 'Mexico']",N/A

You a Bounty Hunter?""BH - ""A man's got to do something for a living these days""JW - ""Dyin' ain't much of a livin' boy""The difference with this film (over say the spagetti westerns) is that Eastwoods character gradually becomes part of a family like gang of people.

233651,A3B7TR8OU3NZBE,6300269043,SK,"[2, 4]","Clint Eastwood's movie, The Outlaw Josey Wales, is a classic in the Western genre. This movie is one of the best Western movies that I have ever seen.The story of the movie goes like this. Josey Wales(Clint Eastwood) is a peaceful farmer in Missouri with a family in the middle of the Civil War. One day some Union Soldiers burn down his house (with his son in it) and kidnap his wife. Angry and Furious, Josey Wales joins some confederate guerillas and fights hard. When Confederacy surrenders, Josey Wales refuses and heads west. He travels to Texas and along the way picks up odd group: couple of Native Americans, an Old Grandmother, a beautiful woman and two servants. At the same time they are chased by Union soldiers.I will not reveal the story further. However, what makes this movie a classic is the depth and dimension to the characters and superb action.The character of Josey Wales is really complex. He turns from a peaceful farmer to a tobacco chewing, hell raising, gunslinger. However his humane side is seen through his hard attitude at times. He saves a native american girl from couple of scoundrels. He also saves travelers from another group of bandits. At the same time, he is a tobacco spitting hard man. Josey Wales spits on everything, from a scorpio to a union officer. The other characters are not as intensely developed, which is understandable since Josey Wales is the primary focus of the movie.The action in the movie is just amazing. I will summarize three great scenes which will make you, the reader, want to just watch the movie. In first scene Josey Wales is carrying food and confronted by four soldiers... In another one Josey Wales(and his six-shooter) all by himself is up against 10-15 bandits...In the last one, Josey Wales and his Six-shooter, go toe-to-toe against tens of horse-riding soldiers...I will leave the action for you to watch.Also this movie is directed by Eastwood himself.

233654,A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM,6300269043,Stanley Crowe,"[0, 0]","Isn't it strange how the conventions of the Western put us at a distance from the reactions that would usually accompany violence to an extent that ""realistic"" crime drama does not.  Eastwood's ""Dirty Harry"" movies troubled people -- but something like ""Josey Wales"" or ""The Unforgiven"" presents characters who are at least as morally questionable, and we're entertained by them in a  relatively uncomplicated way.  Josey Wales, in this movie, has been driven to become something of a monster, a killing machine -- and I know that's not the whole story about him but it's big part of it, and it's what Eastwood brilliantly suggests in the footage that we see while the credits at the beginning are rolling.  And yes, he has suffered . . . horribly.  But not everyone who suffers thus takes on the avenger role with the kind of frightening lack of affect that Josey displays.  It's like Macbeth, psychologically -- he has supped full of horrors above and beyond the loss of his family in Civil War engagements, and he seems almost beyond feeling.  The story of the movie is of his return to something closer to humanity, but since he's a wanted man, he will never be able to shake the killer in him totally.Josey is a loner -- but, as is not the case in all such films, we have seen how he becomes one, and here we have Eastwood's gift at work -- the gift of adjusting the conventions of the Western genre to give it psychological and even spiritual interest.  Here, the interest is in Josey re-acquiring a kind of ""family"" that he comes to care about, without really intending to, and there's a considerable humor in that.  A lot of it centers on his relation to the old Indian played by Chief Dan George, who constantly reminds Josey of the fact of aging and the fact that there are other ways of thinking about the world than those Josey takes for granted.  It can get a bit cute -- but Eastwood clearly loved working with George (near 80 when the movie was filmed) and it's as if he just lets him riff when he wants to.  So the new ""family"" is multi-ethnic, and includes old, young, and middle-aged.  And Josey cares about them and protects them without ever articulating much about this strange quasi-domestic situation that he, a wanted man, is in.  The fact of his reticence is clear throughout -- he makes more points by spitting than talking. With that in mind, one of the strongest scenes of the movie doesn't quite ring true -- the scene of his parley with Ten Bear (Will Sampson), the Comanche chief who seems to be readying his warriors for an attack on the ""family.""  Josey makes an eloquent case for peace and shared living that convinces Ten Bear, and they swear blood brotherhood.  It's a marvellously shot and paced scene -- and the eloquence has power . . . but is it Josey?That scene led to one of my expectations not being fulfilled.  I thought that when Fletcher and the Bounty-hunters tracked Josey down, the Comanches would sweep down from the bluffs and help the ""family"" take care of business.  They don't -- the family does pretty well on its own, and at the end, Josey, wounded, rides off, with Fletcher, once his Civil War commander and now his pursuer, giving him a head start.  Fletcher remains a bit of a mystery -- in a sense he taught Josey to become what he became, but it seems as if he connives at the Union soldiers' slaughter of his troop when they come in to claim the promised amnesty early in the movie.

233656,A1FNES0QEBJZD1,6300269043,Steve Douglas,"[6, 6]","To be honest, I wasn't expecting much in the way of quality when I bought this movie on Blu Ray.  Many of Eastwoods films have suffered from poor video transfer quality and lossy audio codecs.  Happy to say I lucked out on this release.  Since everyone else has already provided their summaries of the storyline, their opinions on the acting and everything else, I will, as I always do, only focus upon the quality of the transfer of this film to Blu Ray.VIDEO....Other than some early, and mild, light film grain, the video transfer to Blu Ray is as clean as you can hope for.  Colors all looked vibrant and restored, not popping as you might see in some Sci Fi films, but proper and lifelike.  Much of the early part of the film is color graded with a very cool appearing bluish cast but once the film establishes both the characters and acting there is a warmth of color to the rest of the film.  While I saw no artifacting or un-natural DNR it does appear that they have crushed the blacks a touch so that some detail is lost in the darker or shadow scenes.  However, this does not detract from the  transfer to a significant degree.  Contrast is really very good and much better than I expected this older film to be.  Mbps rate averages in the low to mid twenties.  The video quality is a significant step up from the standard definition dvd release.AUDIO....Many of Eastwood's films, even on Blu Ray, come with a lossy audio.  The Outlaw Josey Wales brings a lossless DTS HD MA 5.1 audio that surprised me with its very good use of the front stage left and right surrounds for directionality and panning of the audio.  Even the rears are used intermittently when necessary.  Audio levels are set properly between foley effects and soundtrack so once you set your volume you shouldn't have to go back to it.  For the most part, the rears and LFE channel are used for ambience but never the less, the audio for this movie is heads and tails above many of the Eastwood releases.Extras...A very interesting documentary on Eastwood's origins in the Western genre beginning with the Rawhide TV show I used to watch as a kid.  There is also the typical commentary by Richard Schickel and two other featurettes called 'Eastwood in Action' and 'Hell Hath No Fury'  as well as a 'making of' and trailer.  No deleted scenes, but no advertisements for other movies either.If you already have the Standard Def on DVD release, it is my suggestion that buying the blu ray version will be an excellent upgrade.All my reviews focus solely on the quality of the transfers to Blu Ray of both video and audio and I do hope that this review has been of some help to you in deciding upon your purchase decisions and that I am on the correct path with this type of review.Thanks for reading.",5,The Outlaw Josey Wales on Blu Ray,1374969600,"07 28, 2013",2013,2775,"['be', 'honest', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'much', 'way', 'quality', 'when', 'bought', 'movie', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'Many', 'Eastwoods', 'films', 'have', 'suffered', 'poor', 'video', 'transfer', 'quality', 'lossy', 'audio', 'codecs', 'Happy', 'say', 'lucked', 'out', 'release', 'everyone', 'else', 'already', 'provided', 'summaries', 'storyline', 'opinions', 'acting', 'everything', 'else', 'will', 'always', 'do', 'only', 'quality', 'transfer', 'film', 'Blu', 'Ray.VIDEO', '.Other', 'early', 'mild', 'light', 'film', 'grain', 'video', 'transfer', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'as', 'clean', 'can', 'hope', 'Colors', 'looked', 'vibrant', 'restored', 'not', 'popping', 'might', 'see', 'Sci', 'Fi', 'films', 'proper', 'lifelike', 'Much', 'early', 'part', 'film', 'color', 'graded', 'very', 'cool', 'appearing', 'bluish', 'cast', 'once', 'film', 'characters', 'acting', 'warmth', 'color', 'rest', 'film', 'saw', 'artifacting', 'un-natural', 'DNR', 'appear', 'have', 'crushed', 'blacks', 'touch', 'detail', 'lost', 'darker', 'shadow', 'scenes', 'However', 'not', 'detract', 'transfer', 'significant', 'degree', 'Contrast', 'really', 'very', 'good', 'much', 'better', 'expected', 'older', 'film', 'be', 'Mbps', 'rate', 'averages', 'low', 'mid', 'twenties', 'video', 'quality', 'significant', 'step', 'up', 'standard', 'definition', 'dvd', 'release.AUDIO', '.Many', 'Eastwood', 'films', 'even', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'come', 'lossy', 'audio', 'Outlaw', 'Josey', 'Wales', 'lossless', 'DTS', 'HD', 'MA', '5.1', 'audio', 'surprised', 'very', 'good', 'use', 'front', 'stage', 'left', 'right', 'surrounds', 'directionality', 'panning', 'audio', 'Even', 'rears', 'are', 'used', 'intermittently', 'when', 'necessary', 'Audio', 'levels', 'are', 'set', 'properly', 'foley', 'effects', 'soundtrack', 'so', 'once', 'set', 'volume', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'go', 'back', 'most', 'part', 'rears', 'LFE', 'channel', 'are', 'used', 'ambience', 'never', 'less', 'audio', 'movie', 'heads', 'tails', 'many', 'Eastwood', 'releases.Extras', 'very', 'interesting', 'documentary', 'Eastwood', 'origins', 'Western', 'genre', 'beginning', 'Rawhide', 'TV', 'show', 'used', 'watch', 'kid', 'also', 'typical', 'commentary', 'Richard', 'Schickel', 'two', 'other', 'featurettes', 'called', ""'Eastwood"", 'Action', ""'Hell"", 'Hath', 'No', 'Fury', 'as', 'well', ""'making"", 'trailer', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'advertisements', 'other', 'movies', 'either.If', 'already', 'have', 'Standard', 'Def', 'DVD', 'release', 'suggestion', 'buying', 'blu', 'ray', 'version', 'will', 'be', 'excellent', 'upgrade.All', 'reviews', 'focus', 'solely', 'quality', 'transfers', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'video', 'audio', 'do', 'hope', 'review', 'been', 'help', 'deciding', 'purchase', 'decisions', 'am', 'correct', 'path', 'type', 'review.Thanks', 'reading']",N/A

Included on almost every important ""Best of"" list for 1976, Eastwood's amazing cinematic masterpiece was all but snubbed by the Academy. That he was finally recognized for the much-inferior ""Unforgiven"" is a shameful irony. The western genre was in decline by the 1970s and had largely devolved into cliche or cartoonish parody. The genius of Eastwood's vision was to take traditional western stereotypes and turn them on their heads, demythologize the rigidly black/white good-vs-evil Saturday matinee morality, and show us characters with real depth, real motivations and real inner conflicts; not always ""good"" or always ""bad"" but sometimes walking a fine line, driven to one side or the other by circumstances beyond one man's control. The look of the film is gorgeous, showing us a smokey, autumnal by-gone world, sometimes crude, often gritty. It's not clear we'd want to live in such a time or place, but we are drawn in nonetheless. Wonderful acting, and a whole passel of great character actors, including the inimitable Chief Dan George, bring the story to vibrant life. There's plenty of action to keep the adrenaline flowing, and the story draws to a logical, satisfying, if artfully understated, conclusion.

Otherwise this is an excellent movie.  My favorite  scene is when Josey Wales confronts Ten Bears and delivers a great  libertarian message &quot;Governments don't live together, people live  together.  With governments you don't always get a fair word or a fair  fight&quot; and Ten Bears replies &quot;It is sad that governments are  chiefed by the double tongues&quot;.  The whole movie in fact has a  libertarian theme, being about ordinary people who just want to live on a  plot of land of their own and just be left alone.  Also good is the closing  scene with Fletcher, his former comrade in arms.  For those who like gun  battles, Outlaw has perhaps one of the highest body counts in any Western.

233668,A2Q13PHEXGR48Q,6300269043,T O'Brien,"[3, 3]","In his second western as a director and star, Clint Eastwood made a classic with his 1976 western The Outlaw Josey Wales.  Early in the Civil War, Missouri farmer Josey Wales sees his family murdered and farm burned down.  Looking for revenge, he joins a guerilla outfit of Confederate cavalry, wreaking havoc on Union forces.  But late in the war, the rest of the outfit is massacred when trying to surrender, with Josey and one other man escaping the bloodbath.  The duo head west into the Indian Nations and then Texas with a bloodthirsty major on his trail.  Making the chase worse, a $5,000 bounty has been placed on Josey's head causing anyone who can handle a gun to be on the lookout for him.  By 1976, Eastwood was a western icon, and he puts it all together here as director and star.  It's a great story, plenty of action, some humor and great one-liners, and a great supporting cast.  Eastwood's best American western right there with Unforgiven, give Josey Wales a shot if you've missed it!Playing one of his more complicated characters, Eastwood is Josey Wales, the outlaw on the run.  Wales is both a killer and a protector as people begin to join him on the trail.  Eastwood is great in the part as a more humane but still deadly gunfighter.  Chief Dan George is perfectly cast as Lone Watie, an old Cherokee man who travels with Wales.  A friendship develops between the men who share more in common than you might think.  Sondra Locke plays Laura Lee, a young woman Josey rescues from a gang of Comancheros and starts to have feelings for him.  John Vernon and Bill McKinney are the two very different villains, Fletcher, a man who saw his men massacred and is forced to hunt down Wales, and Terrill, a bloodthirsty major looking to finish off the outlaw. Paula Treuman, Sam Bottoms, and Geraldine Kearns also have good parts as some of Josey's traveling companions.  And check out these small supporting parts that include Woodrow Parfrey, Joyce Jameson, Royal Dano, Will Sampson, Matt Clark, John Russell, Charles Tyner, John Davis Chandler, John Quade, and Sheb Wooley.The DVD is a steal with a widescreen presentation that looks great and a handful of special features.  The best is a 30-minute making of documentary, ""Hell Hath No Fury,"" but there's also an 8-minute featurette made during filming, a trailer, and three or four menus with cast and crew and background on the movie.

""Wales"" was a sign post of Eastwood's final western the dark and, well, unforgiving ""The Unforgiven"" and, although not quite as dark as that film, ""Wales"" is certainly as dark as his previous film (which also paved the way for ""Wales"") the spooky ""High Plains Drifter"".After Wales family is slaughtered he joins Confederate fighters led by Captain Fletcher (the always marvelous character actor John Vernon). At the conclusion of the war Fletcher convinces his men except for Josie to surrender to the Union all of them unaware that there are plans to execute Fletcher's men as part of an arrangement to save Fletcher's neck. Josie escapes with Jaime (Sam Bottoms) unaware that they are being pursued by Fletcher and the Union soldiers. Josie attracts a ragtag band of fellow travelers along the way.The transfer: ""Wales"" has never looked this good on home video which highlights the flaws of mid-70's film stock as well as the look of the film itself. Grain is consistent throughout the presentation and looks quite nice adding to unique look. The colors are bolder than previous home video versions and the skin tones are just right for the look of this gritty film.The film continues to show the influence of Eastwood's mentor Don Siegel (""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"", ""Dirty Harry"")and Leone (""The Good, The Bad and The Ugly"")but also demonstrates Eastwood's growth as a director.""Wales"" was a problematic production; writer-director Philip Kaufman (""The Right Stuff"", ""The Warriors"", ""The Unbareable Lightness of Being"" and who co-wrote the script for ""Wales"" from the book by Forrest Carter) was fired during the shoot early on (after repeatedly butting heads with Eastwood over co-star Sandra Locke; it seems both wanted to woo her.) and Eastwood reluctantly took on the reins as director which forced Eastwood to push through the shoot without the usual prepartion he would have done as director. Luckily, Kaufman's excellent script survives largely intact and Eastwood compliments the script; it's hard to imagine what Kaufman might have done differently from Eastwood and while it is sad that he was robbed of the chance to complete the project himself, at least his vision somewhat survives.THe film sports a nice 5.1 DTS lossless soundtrack that nicely captures the environment depicted in the film.The special features are surprisingly good for this film. Unlike some companies that have been releasing catalog titles (even those with big stars or that have a following)lately, the extras here aren't just recycled from the previous version of the film.The 30 minute punningly titled ""Eastwood's West"" gathers the usual suspects from co-stars to critics discussing a variety of Eastwood's films from the 1970's (although the focus is, not surprisingly, on ""Wales""). It's an excellent short documentary.""Hell Hath No Fury"" the excellent featurette on the production of the film IS carried over from the previous DVD special edtion.Kaufman is, not surprisingly, absent from the proceedings and that's too bad; it would have been fascinating to hear his take on what occurred 34 years later with the perspective of time. The chance in director isn't addressed really.We also get the original vintage promotional featurette (although it doesn't provide much in the way of insight into the production of the film being PC). We also get the original trailer for the film.A classic dark, brooding western ""The Outlaw Josey Wales"" has retained many of the qualities that made it so memorable in 1976 and the raw violence is still somewhat startling.Warner has done a really good job of restoring the film for Blu-ray.

233675,A26HCZQ03ZQQ5O,6300269043,Wilson Pupps,"[11, 12]","There is something about Clint Eastwood that allows him the luxury of delivering a cheesey macho line without looking like an ass. In a movie full of such lines, Eastwood really shines in this epic western. I have always wondered why the critics never gave this western its due, while normal every day joes continue to give it the thumbs up. I believe the answer lies in the sympathic portrayal of the Confederate outlaw who is Josey Wales. How dare anyone cast anything wearing a Confederate uniform in anything less than an evil light? Moreover, How dare anyone portray Union Soldiers as a bunch of marauding murderers who looted and pillaged their way through a defeated South? These are the type of thoughts likely dancing through the heads of liberal wine drinking cheese eating newspaper types while sitting down to disparage what is Eastwood's best movie.If this is really what troubles the crtics, then the everyday joes are left ot wonder why. After all, this is one of the first westerns to positively portray the Native American. Gone are the the usual ""Indian"" stereotypes of broken English, firewater references, and raids on helpless pioneers. In their place, stand references to the Trail of Tears and good hearted attempts to conform with the ""white man's world"". Furthermore, Josey Wales was never a slave owner but a man seeking vengeance on a rogue group of Union cavalrymen who murdered his family. Taken in its proper context, the war supplies merely a backdrop that allows Josey Wales to develop as a character.Amidst all the seriousness of vengeance and social commentary regarding the treatment of Native Americans lies several instances of black comedy which keeps the movie from becoming too bitter and preachy. Sure Josey Wales blows away several men with his pistols, but he always makes us laugh by splattering their dead foreheads with tobacco juice, or uttering another of those macho cheesey lines. His elderly side kick supplies a few laughs along the way by bedding a young woman and shoving horny toads in the sleeping face of Josey Wales.As many times as the Outlaw Josey Wales has been replayed on cable, I guess is the same amount of times I have seen a negative review placed next to its title in the newspaper television guide. With such unfavorable reviews, it's a continued wonder that people continue to discover this film.

233676,AP3B615GM191G,6300269043,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[0, 1]","After recently watching Unforgiven and being completely blown-away by it once again, I decided (on the advice of others) to try out The Outlaw Josey Wales, which I had not seen since I was probably about 12 years old.  Though I didn't hate it, it never really gripped me like Unforgiven or my other top-shelf westerns.For a basic plot summary, The Outlaw Josey Wales tells the story of Josey Wales (Clint Eastwood), a man who witnesses his home and family destroyed by a group of Union soldiers.  After witnessing this terrible event, Josey first hooks up with a Confederate troupe on the verge of surrender.  When he refuses to officially lay down arms, he is soon hunted by the very people who destroyed his entire life.There are two overwhelmingly positive things I have to say about this movie:1. Eastwood is solid-as-usual as his typical &#34;man with no name&#34; character.2. I really liked the supporting cast, including Chief Dan George, Sondra Locke, and John Vernon, among others.  What this film lacked in direction/plot for me it often made up for in witty or emotional character interactions.On the flip side, though, I also have two scathing critiques of the film (i.e. the reasons why it is a three-star experience to me):1. Unlike Unforgiven, which gives a bit more background on its Eastwood-played protagonist, Josey Wales failed to make a mark on me in that regard.  Besides the very quick family-establishing scene in the beginning, very little is revealed about Josey's family life.  To me, then, the film didn't do a good enough job of establishing just why exactly we should care about the plight of Mr. Wales.2. This movie was made in 1976, or at the tail end of John Wayne's popularity.  Wayne, of course, made a much different kind of western than did Eastwood, and I think sometimes Outlaw Josey Wales goes a bit too far in trying to illustrate those differences.  Whereas Unforgiven (I know I reference this film a lot...but it is truly one of my all-time favorites) gets that balance just right, this one seems to revel a bit too much in its gritty approach to the West.  Very little backstory is given to any character, and one scene in particular (the Sondra Locke rape scene) is very out-of-context from the rest of the film.Thus, when I look at The Outlaw Josey Wales, I see Clint Eastwood in the beginning stages of honing his own Western on-screen mentality.  He hadn't quite found the perfect formula yet, but all the elements were beginning to come into place.",3,"Clint Still Honing His ""Modern Western"" Craft",1395705600,"03 25, 2014",2014,2498,"['recently', 'watching', 'Unforgiven', 'being', 'completely', 'blown-away', 'once', 'again', 'decided', 'advice', 'others', 'try', 'out', 'Outlaw', 'Josey', 'Wales', 'had', 'not', 'seen', 'was', 'probably', '12', 'years', 'old', 'did', ""n't"", 'hate', 'never', 'really', 'gripped', 'Unforgiven', 'other', 'top-shelf', 'westerns.For', 'basic', 'plot', 'summary', 'Outlaw', 'Josey', 'Wales', 'story', 'Josey', 'Wales', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'man', 'who', 'home', 'family', 'destroyed', 'group', 'Union', 'soldiers', 'witnessing', 'terrible', 'event', 'Josey', 'first', 'up', 'Confederate', 'troupe', 'verge', 'surrender', 'When', 'officially', 'lay', 'down', 'arms', 'soon', 'hunted', 'very', 'people', 'who', 'destroyed', 'entire', 'are', 'two', 'overwhelmingly', 'positive', 'things', 'have', 'say', 'movie:1', 'Eastwood', 'solid-as-usual', 'typical', '34', 'man', 'name', '34', 'character.2', 'really', 'liked', 'supporting', 'cast', 'including', 'Chief', 'Dan', 'George', 'Sondra', 'Locke', 'John', 'Vernon', 'others', 'What', 'film', 'lacked', 'direction/plot', 'often', 'made', 'up', 'witty', 'emotional', 'character', 'interactions.On', 'flip', 'side', 'also', 'have', 'two', 'scathing', 'critiques', 'film', 'i.e', 'reasons', 'why', 'three-star', 'experience', ':1', 'Unforgiven', 'bit', 'more', 'background', 'Eastwood-played', 'protagonist', 'Josey', 'Wales', 'failed', 'make', 'mark', 'regard', 'very', 'quick', 'family-establishing', 'scene', 'beginning', 'very', 'little', 'revealed', 'Josey', 'family', 'life', 'then', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'good', 'enough', 'job', 'establishing', 'just', 'why', 'exactly', 'should', 'care', 'plight', 'Mr.', 'Wales.2', 'movie', 'was', 'made', '1976', 'tail', 'end', 'John', 'Wayne', 'popularity', 'Wayne', 'course', 'made', 'much', 'different', 'kind', 'western', 'did', 'Eastwood', 'think', 'sometimes', 'Outlaw', 'Josey', 'Wales', 'bit', 'too', 'far', 'trying', 'illustrate', 'differences', 'Whereas', 'Unforgiven', 'know', 'reference', 'film', 'lot', 'truly', 'one', 'all-time', 'favorites', 'balance', 'just', 'right', 'one', 'revel', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'gritty', 'approach', 'West', 'Very', 'little', 'backstory', 'given', 'character', 'one', 'scene', 'particular', 'Sondra', 'Locke', 'rape', 'scene', 'very', 'out-of-context', 'rest', 'film.Thus', 'when', 'look', 'Outlaw', 'Josey', 'Wales', 'see', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'beginning', 'stages', 'honing', 'own', 'Western', 'on-screen', 'mentality', 'had', ""n't"", 'quite', 'found', 'perfect', 'formula', 'yet', 'elements', 'were', 'beginning', 'come', 'place']",N/A
