My family loved it so much that I decided to buy the first season and we are very satisfied. This show is entertaining to a younger crowed but very funny for adults too. This season comes with 2 disks just like season 2. There is an interactive activity on this set of disks that my kids love. It's called shaving the sheep. The kids love it. It's very funny because it changes each time the barn door closes. If you or your kids enjoy Shaun the sheep, then this is a must. It's a cute show without annoying characters. The price of this season is very good too. You can't beat that price anywhere.",5,This is great,1361664000,"02 24, 2013",2013,666,"['Well', 'did', 'backwards', 'First', 'bought', 'Shun', 'sheep', 'season', '2', 'family', 'loved', 'so', 'much', 'decided', 'buy', 'first', 'season', 'are', 'very', 'satisfied', 'show', 'entertaining', 'younger', 'crowed', 'very', 'funny', 'adults', 'too', 'season', '2', 'disks', 'just', 'season', '2', 'interactive', 'activity', 'set', 'disks', 'kids', 'love', 'called', 'shaving', 'sheep', 'kids', 'love', 'very', 'funny', 'time', 'barn', 'door', 'closes', 'kids', 'enjoy', 'Shaun', 'sheep', 'then', 'must', 'cute', 'show', 'annoying', 'characters', 'price', 'season', 'very', 'good', 'too', 'ca', ""n't"", 'beat', 'price', 'anywhere']",Shaun the Sheep - Complete Series 1

Then when I saw that Shaun the Sheep had his own spin-off show I have to admit that I was non-plussed, and didn't give these offerings a look...until now.It was my 12-yr old daughter who suggested that we give them a try, so we did.  We found them to be occasionally laugh-out-loud funny!  Every episode includes three short segments, none of which is directly linked to any other one as far as I can tell, except that the more you watch, the better you get to know the characters.  That takes a little doing, since none of them talk - ever!  I mean, the farmer does vocalize a sort of non-descript series of grunts and sounds, but there is never any real question about what he's saying.  Blitzer the sheep dog loves to kick back, listening to music on his headphones and sipping tea or having a snack, while Shaun is clearly the brains of the whole gaggle of creatures - much like Bugs Bunny was the brains of his set of characters.Oh, I love the pigs too.  They can't stand the sheep, and the sheep live in fear of them.  That's the farm yard...oh, there's a bull too.  Watch out!The claymation is great, but is a half a level or a full level below that of Wallace and Gromit.  Still, I enjoy watching these with my daughter.  We usually watch one episode per night.

I wish they were Widescreen instead of Fullscreen, but the sharpness is excellent. I just wanted to say I agree with other customers that it is a wonderful series. For years I have kept my eye out for what may entertain the extended families, children, and grandchildren. That was how I discovered Thomas years ago and it was a big hit. I am now passing the word on this TV series from the UK. Although recommended for ages 5-7, younger children will enjoy it as well, and probably most ages will find something to like about this funny comedy about the adventures of a group of sheep on a farm. These are available to rent if you want to check them out first, but most families will want to own them to take them while travelling. I can't wait to see this in original format, and Blu-ray would be nice.
