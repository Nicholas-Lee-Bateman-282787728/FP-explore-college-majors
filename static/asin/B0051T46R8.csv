1437356,A1EA7VXIUZBYIK,B0051T46R8,"Jason Brown ""Dark-edged Apologist""","[1, 2]","If this is how most Christian movies are meant to be, it's a good thing I go more for Affirm Films. This is the first film I got from Pure|Flix and, from the start, I could tell it was likely going to be predictable. Sadly, it was. I found myself, often, thinking the package cover had a better look than most of the movie. The award for Truly Moving Picture? It has its moments, I'll admit. Main reason I decided to get it was because the back cover described it as ""edgy, thought-provoking"", and, to certain degrees, it is. It's G rated, though there are a couple scenes dealing with breaking and entering and being a thief, while another scene has someone calling another person a drug addict, questioning why they're in that life. Not to mention a scene involving crushed beer cans. All that in a Christian G-rated movie? Seems borderline PG. The story itself has a nice element dealing with horses that, unlike Disney's Secretariat, is enjoyable. And it's a nice plot device for learning to trust those you normally wouldn't and having a desire different from what you normally would. Sadly, there's the main character's boyfriend who, like in literally ANY given Disney flick, you can tell is not good, a flat-out, cardboard cut-out stereotype of a bad person. Selfish, trying to push someone to be bad, and apparently, in some Christians' minds, someone who dresses in some kind of edgy way can't be a good person (while the young woman is becoming a better person, she does get influenced to change her hair and get a different wardrobe- and I saw nothing wrong with how she looked before, it was modest, just different from conventional, is that a bad thing?). I guess since he doesn't change his looks, he can't change his attitude nor perspective. Not to mention, when the girl decides to be a Christian, she's pretty typical (""I've been thinking of when Jesus died for my sins."" Why does no one ever have a character who farther into theology and ask what that means, especially the way society is today where things don't always make sense all the time?). Beforehand, she doesn't seem like she'd ever give a second thought about the word ""sin"", let alone what it means, then suddenly gets heartfelt? Doesn't feel realistic enough. And theologically, I've yet to see a movie that actually has a shocking revelation from the Bible itself- Jesus had never told a person to PRAY for their sin, just to confess and ask.Still, with all the stereotypes given and plot predictability, it does have some good, Biblically-driven themes of changing you life around and becoming different, learning to trust (mentioned before), has some nice scenery here and there (and the horses are a plus), and some of the backstories behind the characters are decent.

1437365,ABC8FXLD7W528,B0051T46R8,"Penny Zeller, Christian Author and Speaker","[12, 13]","Ashley is a troubled teen who is sent to live with her Aunt Diane after being released from treatment. Ashley adamantly pushes her aunt out of her life. When she discovers a neglected horse, Ashley seeks Diane's assistance in helping the horse (whom she names Winston) to recover. In doing so, Ashley sees that there is more to life than her own problems. She also sees for the first time that Winston isn't the only one who is broken.One of my favorite parts about this movie is the example Ashley's Aunt Diane sets for her. Diane is a strong Christian who, while not perfect, seeks to live her life for Christ. Diane never preaches at Ashley, but instead shows her what it means to be a Christ follower through her own actions. Diane's patience, kindness, and compassion do not go unnoticed by Ashley. We also see at the beginning of the movie that Diane is praying for Ashley. It's a fair assumption that Diane continues to pray for her young niece throughout the entire movie and never gives up on Ashley, even though Ashley stumbles and, at times, yields to temptation.There are some great discussion points in this movie. Ashley struggles with drug abuse. While on probation, she is instructed to have no contact with her boyfriend. Yet, she makes the mistake of disobeying that order. It is a good example of why the choices we make are so important. They not only affect us, but also affect others. While there is some deep subject matter, I found this movie to be appropriate for those ages nine and up.Saving Winston is slow at times, but the end result is worth it. This movie has heart and shows how, no matter how broken we are, Jesus still loves us and yearns for us to find salvation and peace through Him.I have added Saving Winston to my mom-approved movie listing on my wordpress blog.Reviewed by Penny Zeller, Author of 77 Ways Your Family Can Make a Difference: Ideas and Activities for Serving Others",5,A movie with a lot of heart...,1330905600,"03 5, 2012",2012,1921,"['Ashley', 'troubled', 'teen', 'who', 'sent', 'live', 'Aunt', 'Diane', 'being', 'released', 'treatment', 'Ashley', 'adamantly', 'aunt', 'life', 'When', 'neglected', 'horse', 'Ashley', 'Diane', 'assistance', 'helping', 'horse', 'whom', 'Winston', 'recover', 'doing', 'so', 'Ashley', 'more', 'life', 'own', 'problems', 'also', 'first', 'time', 'Winston', ""n't"", 'only', 'one', 'who', 'broken.One', 'favorite', 'parts', 'movie', 'example', 'Ashley', 'Aunt', 'Diane', 'sets', 'Diane', 'strong', 'Christian', 'who', 'not', 'perfect', 'live', 'life', 'Christ', 'Diane', 'never', 'Ashley', 'instead', 'what', 'be', 'Christ', 'follower', 'own', 'actions', 'Diane', 'patience', 'kindness', 'compassion', 'do', 'not', 'go', 'unnoticed', 'Ashley', 'also', 'see', 'beginning', 'movie', 'Diane', 'praying', 'Ashley', 'fair', 'assumption', 'Diane', 'pray', 'young', 'niece', 'entire', 'movie', 'never', 'up', 'Ashley', 'even', 'Ashley', 'stumbles', 'times', 'yields', 'are', 'great', 'discussion', 'points', 'movie', 'Ashley', 'drug', 'abuse', 'probation', 'instructed', 'have', 'contact', 'boyfriend', 'mistake', 'disobeying', 'order', 'good', 'example', 'why', 'choices', 'make', 'are', 'so', 'important', 'not', 'only', 'affect', 'also', 'affect', 'others', 'deep', 'subject', 'matter', 'found', 'movie', 'be', 'appropriate', 'ages', 'nine', 'up.Saving', 'Winston', 'slow', 'times', 'end', 'result', 'movie', 'heart', 'how', 'matter', 'how', 'are', 'Jesus', 'still', 'yearns', 'find', 'salvation', 'peace', 'Him.I', 'have', 'added', 'Saving', 'Winston', 'mom-approved', 'movie', 'listing', 'wordpress', 'blog.Reviewed', 'Penny', 'Zeller', 'Author', '77', 'Ways', 'Family', 'Can', 'Make', 'Difference', 'Ideas', 'Activities', 'Serving', 'Others']",Saving Winston
