It seemed some movie about a man becoming one with the apes.  It most certainly was not that type of movie at all.I should have known, Anthony Hopkins and Cuba Gooding Jr. have yet to dissappoint me.The story is about an anthropologist that has been charged with when considered missing, killing several park rangers.  He is sent back to the states and imprisoned.  They assume he is insane.  It appears he was missing because he was living with the apes for 2 years.A young up and coming psychiatrist in training, chomps at the bit to find out what makes this man tick.  Of course he rocks the boat in the daily grind of a prison system.  The tricks and compromises of a established prison system dealing with deranged prisoners is medieval in the eyes of a newcomer.This young psychiatrist is charged with finding &quot;What happened?&quot; to this noted professor.  Why did he kill those rangers, what was he doing with the apes?  Things progess a bit more rapidly than reality would probably dictate, but you get the answers Cuba Gooding Jr.'s character is looking for.  They might not be what you expected.I thought the acting was magnificent.  They are a wonderful counterpoint to one another: Anthony Hopkin's intensity and Cuba Gooding Jr.'s exhuberance.As Anthony Hopkin's character is a fairly learned man, his examination of the problem is a global one.  His own person solution is to say unique.Thought provoking and entertaining movie.",5,"It's great, not at all what  I expected",970185600,"09 29, 2000",2000,1540,"['Based', 'previews', 'had', 'seen', 'had', 'decided', 'was', 'not', 'movie', 'was', 'interested', 'seemed', 'movie', 'man', 'becoming', 'one', 'apes', 'most', 'certainly', 'was', 'not', 'type', 'movie', 'all.I', 'should', 'have', 'known', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'Cuba', 'Gooding', 'Jr.', 'have', 'yet', 'dissappoint', 'me.The', 'story', 'anthropologist', 'been', 'charged', 'when', 'considered', 'missing', 'killing', 'several', 'park', 'rangers', 'sent', 'back', 'states', 'imprisoned', 'assume', 'insane', 'was', 'missing', 'was', 'living', 'apes', '2', 'years.A', 'young', 'up', 'coming', 'psychiatrist', 'training', 'chomps', 'bit', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'man', 'tick', 'course', 'boat', 'daily', 'grind', 'prison', 'system', 'tricks', 'compromises', 'established', 'prison', 'system', 'dealing', 'deranged', 'prisoners', 'medieval', 'eyes', 'newcomer.This', 'young', 'psychiatrist', 'charged', 'finding', 'quot', 'What', 'happened', 'quot', 'noted', 'professor', 'Why', 'did', 'kill', 'rangers', 'what', 'was', 'doing', 'apes', 'Things', 'progess', 'bit', 'more', 'rapidly', 'reality', 'would', 'probably', 'dictate', 'get', 'answers', 'Cuba', 'Gooding', 'Jr.', 'character', 'looking', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'what', 'expected.I', 'thought', 'acting', 'was', 'magnificent', 'are', 'wonderful', 'counterpoint', 'one', 'Anthony', 'Hopkin', 'intensity', 'Cuba', 'Gooding', 'Jr.', 'exhuberance.As', 'Anthony', 'Hopkin', 'character', 'fairly', 'learned', 'man', 'examination', 'problem', 'global', 'one', 'own', 'person', 'solution', 'say', 'unique.Thought', 'provoking', 'entertaining', 'movie']",Instinct VHS

470544,ANGH6401L9Y0T,6305608253,"Barbara Frederick ""auntb93""","[0, 0]","Dr. Ethan Powell (Anthony Hopkins) spent two years living with a band of gorillas in Africa. Nobody knew where he was until a group of hunters and game wardens came upon him in the jungle and he killed two of them and injured several more. He was tried by the Rwanda courts and sentenced, but the U.S. State Department got him back to the US. In the airport, he assaulted a group of security guards, and I think he killed a couple of them.He has not spoken since the day he was arrested back in Rwanda, never participated in his defense, and is now in need of a psychiatric evaluation before the US decides what to do with him. He's in a maximum security prison, in the psychotic section.Dr. Ben Hillard (Donald Southerland) assigns his best assistant, Dr. Theo Calder (Cuba Gooding, Jr.), to do the evaluation. Amazingly, Calder gets Powell to talk. He's very violent, but he's also so fascinating that Dr. Calder expects to write a book about him. In fact, Dr. Hillard assumes that's the main reason he wanted to do the evaluation.So Calder goes to this snake pit of a prison every day and meets with Powell. He's also been conned into being on the staff of the psychiatric ward, and has to evaluate the other patients as well. You may see some scenes that put you in mind of ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,"" but it's far more gritty. It becomes clear that the warden and his favorite guard are both sadistic bastards who use any excuse to brutalize the prisoners/patients. Since they put Dr. Calder on the staff, he feels obliged to fight back.Another significant element to the story is Lynn Powell, Dr. Powell's daughter. Her side of it is much too complex to try to summarize here, but since you just have to see this film, you'll figure her out eventually.It's a powerful statement about prisons, mental hospitals, man's relationship to the natural world, and a few other significant things.BTW, Cuba Gooding, Jr., looked so familiar that I looked him up on Wikipedia. Turns out he played an angel-like character in ""What Dreams May Come"" with Robin Williams. The man is definitely eye candy, but he's also a very good actor. I predict big things for him.

470545,ALR35EFI69S5R,6305608253,"Barron Laycock ""Labradorman""","[10, 15]","This is an intriguing film, not so much because of its improbable story line, but because of its intelligent and provocative interest in ideas that are hardly mainstream. Those of us involved with the environmental movement are often exasperated by the unknowing and unfeeling arrogant presumption of natural superiority many human leaders seem to have regarding use and disposition of the world's resources, both natural and otherwise. In this thoughtful film Sir Anthony Hopkins brings his prestige to bear on such heady issues, and forwards an undeniable argument regarding those presumptions.The format of the movie is such that it is necessary to piece together this message, and this is the service that Cuba Gooding provides here as the bearer of logic and modern thought, presuming to examine Hopkins character for mental defect due to the extreme nature of Hopkins outside the mental hospital he is now ensconced in.  Yet the evolving dialogue and plot as it slowly builds is really the uncovering of the ways in which such arrogance and presumptive claims for natural stewardship over the natural order are laid bare for what they are, groundless and silly.Of course, the fact that such ideas are expressed in a movie made for popular consumption is rare enough, but to do so with a message that is clearly enunciated and not overlaid with the weight of its own dramatic detritus is very powerful indeed.  The director is clearly warning us that our misuse and rape of the environment has terrible consequences, but unfortunately not just for us or for humankind, but rather for the whole ecological superstructure on which life on this planet depends.  The idea that we are false ""Gods' and false prophets is made chillingly clear by some of Hopkins monologues.The plot is unusual but not all that plausible; it is unlikely anyone who found his way back to nature would return under any circumstances. Indeed, one of the more profound undercurrents of the classic Edgar Rice Burroughs series of Tarzan novels was the way in which he (Burroughs) constantly counter-posed the rather Victorian idea of the superiority and infallibility of Human progress and civilization on the one hand with the predictably calamitous results of that civilization on the other. Hopkins does much the same thing here, but with much more articulate and even profound use of language and story. This is a very interesting and worthwhile movie, and one I highly recommend.

470546,A1NSMQIF1C2VCE,6305608253,Beau Yarbrough,"[11, 22]","I knew I was in trouble when the opening credits of the film said it was based on the book &quot;Ishmael&quot; by Daniel Quinn, which is a new age guide to living in fiction form about a talking ape imparting the wisdom of the world to the protagonist. (No, really! Look it up in the book section here at Amazon.)How does this relate to a movie about a psychologist helping prisoners and a biologist accused of murder after he apparently spends too much time with great apes? Good question.If I had to guess, I'd theorize that the screenwriter who originally sold this script had a probably very good script about a prison psychologist that he couldn't get sold -- those segments of the film, in fact, are what make it barely watchable. But after getting it turned down, time and again, he must have encountered someone who was a fan of the &quot;Ishmael&quot; book and perversely decided to rework his script into a very, very, very loose adaptation of that work in order to get his prison story on screen.But this film is a train wreck. The prison scenes float in isolation, surrounded by ridiculous acting by characters we can't identify as being remotely human, given how underwritten they are. Gooding's character's eventual reaction to the lessons he learns from Hopkins' character seems to come out of nowhere, unless you know that the book actually had a lot more being imparted. Otherwise &quot;it's bad to kill mother gorillas&quot; is hardly a profound conclusion.Don't even bother renting this turkey. This is something to watch, briefly, when it's on TV for free.

470547,A2F3SXHT6RBV81,6305608253,"Betty Burks ""Betty  Burks""","[0, 1]","This account of a wild and wooly Anthony Hopkins as a killer par excellence who was rescued from his prison in a jungle somewhere and then confined illegally in the U. S.  He had long white hair, strength of an ape (mountain gorillas), and look like Hemingway in 1954.  Like the animals he studied so dilligently, he had the instinct to fight for his survival.  Dr. Calvin writes about the marvelous ability of humans to think and choose to make decisions, solve problems, forecast the future and even create ethics, all using this mental Darwinism.In the confinement in America, he refused to speak or socialize with the other prisoners, all of whom had mental problems.  The jail was full of psychotics and other mental criminals, caged like an animal and abused by the guards.  The cruelty in the guards' behavior caused a riot.  Ethan kept remembering base camp and what happened there, and reflected on his success and failure to protect the apes.  When he decided to trust the doctor, he asked him ""Are you free?""  He apparently he trusted him because he looked like the apes in the jungle.  He needed someone to listen about the murders.  ""I used to be you; see what I have become.""What have you lost when someone else takes over control?  It takes a lot of confidence.  Now he has an opportunity to better himself by appearing in court.  Was it a Good Conviction like Lewis Weinstein's account in the book of the same name?  He had to hold on to show where the violence came from, killing the apes. and acted like a mad man.  Violence can be provoked.  Funny how things can change overnight.  Loving, petting, kissing, holding hands -- you put trust in a person who was not in control.  All was lost, taken away by force.

Nonetheless, I was very impressed and moved by this movie right around the point of the film where Anthony Hopkins starts speaking to Cuba Gooding Jr.  I will jump right to the main points of interest and themes this movie represented beautifully.  Personally speaking I feel the main theme of this movie was driven home when Powell (Hopkins) made it a point to invoke Theo Caulder (Cuba Gooding) the concept of control as an illusion.  That point was further driven home involving the scene where Hopkins coins and incorporates the word ""takers"" into his speaking throughout the movie.  Another interesting part was the scene where Powell was sketching an illustration of the history of the universe in his jail cell pointing out hunter-gatherers, ""takers"", and explaining that takers feel the word dominion is the answer.  Aside from these philosophical blips you see a slow progression of peace and harmony represented in the gymnasium versus the discord and favoritism thwarted by the correctional officers in the beginning of the movie.  In essence Hopkins grew an appreciation, admiration, and awareness of life being inundated with gorillas versus humans.  The gorillas essentially gave him an understanding of peace and harmony existing in our universe, and everyone in humanity has an opportunity to see it if they stopped getting caught up in constant illusions (dominion, greed, panic, fear, ambition, etc).",4,An uplifting eye opening film,1199750400,"01 8, 2008",2008,1578,"['finally', 'got', 'opportunity', 'see', 'movie', '10', 'years', 'renting', 'local', 'blockbuster', 'never', 'getting', 'around', 'sticking', 'DVD', 'player', 'Nonetheless', 'was', 'very', 'impressed', 'moved', 'movie', 'right', 'point', 'film', 'where', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'speaking', 'Cuba', 'Gooding', 'Jr', 'will', 'jump', 'right', 'main', 'points', 'interest', 'themes', 'movie', 'represented', 'beautifully', 'Personally', 'speaking', 'feel', 'main', 'theme', 'movie', 'was', 'driven', 'home', 'when', 'Powell', 'Hopkins', 'made', 'point', 'invoke', 'Theo', 'Caulder', 'Cuba', 'Gooding', 'concept', 'control', 'illusion', 'point', 'was', 'further', 'driven', 'home', 'involving', 'scene', 'where', 'Hopkins', 'coins', 'word', 'takers', 'speaking', 'movie', 'interesting', 'part', 'was', 'scene', 'where', 'Powell', 'was', 'sketching', 'illustration', 'history', 'universe', 'jail', 'cell', 'pointing', 'out', 'hunter-gatherers', 'takers', 'explaining', 'takers', 'feel', 'word', 'dominion', 'answer', 'Aside', 'philosophical', 'blips', 'see', 'slow', 'progression', 'peace', 'harmony', 'represented', 'gymnasium', 'discord', 'favoritism', 'thwarted', 'correctional', 'officers', 'beginning', 'movie', 'essence', 'Hopkins', 'grew', 'appreciation', 'admiration', 'awareness', 'life', 'being', 'inundated', 'gorillas', 'versus', 'humans', 'gorillas', 'essentially', 'gave', 'understanding', 'peace', 'harmony', 'existing', 'universe', 'everyone', 'humanity', 'opportunity', 'see', 'stopped', 'getting', 'caught', 'up', 'constant', 'illusions', 'dominion', 'greed', 'panic', 'fear', 'ambition', 'etc']",Instinct VHS

470567,A2NJO6YE954DBH,6305608253,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[2, 5]","As is more and more often the case the trailer for &quot;Instinct&quot; provides what you need to know about this movie.  Noted anthropologist Ethan Powell (Anthony Hopkins) was reported missing in the jungles of Africa and lost for almost two years.  It was said that he was walking amongst the gorillas that he was studying.  Then he murdered a couple of game wardens with a wooden club.  Now he has been returned to the United States and placed in the mental ward of a prison where he refuses to speak.  The case is discussed by a pair of shrinks: Dr. Ben Hillard (Donald Sutherland), who is old and wise, and Dr. Theo Caulder (Cuba Gooding, Jr.), who is young and smart.  Hillard engages briefly in deep thought and then muses: &quot;He lives with the animals, takes on their behavior, and becomes one.  How does that happen?&quot;Of course that is what the movie is about, and young Dr. Caulder is going to go have a series of confrontational sessions with Dr. Powell in prison, get him to talk, and eventually find out the answers to the big question.  But as soon as Hillard articulated the big question I had my hand up because I was pretty sure I knew the answer.  I mean I saw &quot;Gorillas in the Midst&quot; but even without that big clue common sense would pretty much tell you why somebody studying primates in the jungle would favor the apes and side with them against human beings.  There might be some surprises in terms of the details, but certainly the general idea here is clear even before we actually &quot;learn&quot; the answer.  However, to be fair, this film gets credit for not having a sexual relationship develop between young Dr. Caulder and Powell's daughter Lyn (Maura Tierney),Will Anthony Hopkins staring at an inquisitor in a prison setting it is hard not to see parallels between &quot;Instinct&quot; and &quot;Silence of the Lambs.&quot;  Caulder admits at one point that he has become a student as well as a therapist and this 1999 film is one where the patient may well do more for the doctor than the other way around.  Added to this film are your standard roster of prison goons, apathetic doctors, and eccentric prisoner-patients in a simplistic combining of &quot;The Shawshank Redemption&quot; and &quot;One Flew Over the Cukoo's Nest.&quot;  Consequently Caulder not only has to bring Powell back to sanity and his family, but has to fight to reform the corrupt system that he finds.The extras on this DVD consist of the trailer for &quot;Instinct,&quot; as a reminder that it was a lot better than the actual movies, and then pictures of other movies you could have watched instead of this one.  Apparently someone in a decision-making capacity recognized that most people watching this movie were probably to hit the eject button as soon as the credits, so why waste time and money adding extras nobody was going to want to see?",3,You do not need to watch this movie to figure it out,1079049600,"03 12, 2004",2004,2876,"['more', 'more', 'often', 'case', 'trailer', 'quot', 'Instinct', 'quot', 'what', 'need', 'know', 'movie', 'Noted', 'anthropologist', 'Ethan', 'Powell', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'was', 'reported', 'missing', 'jungles', 'Africa', 'lost', 'almost', 'two', 'years', 'was', 'said', 'was', 'walking', 'amongst', 'gorillas', 'was', 'studying', 'Then', 'murdered', 'couple', 'game', 'wardens', 'wooden', 'club', 'Now', 'been', 'returned', 'United', 'States', 'placed', 'mental', 'ward', 'prison', 'where', 'speak', 'case', 'discussed', 'pair', 'shrinks', 'Dr.', 'Ben', 'Hillard', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'who', 'old', 'wise', 'Dr.', 'Theo', 'Caulder', 'Cuba', 'Gooding', 'Jr.', 'who', 'young', 'smart', 'Hillard', 'briefly', 'deep', 'thought', 'then', 'muses', 'quot', 'animals', 'behavior', 'one', 'How', 'happen', 'quot', 'course', 'what', 'movie', 'young', 'Dr.', 'Caulder', 'going', 'go', 'have', 'series', 'confrontational', 'sessions', 'Dr.', 'Powell', 'prison', 'get', 'talk', 'eventually', 'find', 'out', 'answers', 'big', 'question', 'as', 'soon', 'Hillard', 'articulated', 'big', 'question', 'had', 'hand', 'up', 'was', 'pretty', 'sure', 'knew', 'answer', 'mean', 'saw', 'quot', 'Gorillas', 'Midst', 'quot', 'even', 'big', 'clue', 'common', 'sense', 'would', 'pretty', 'much', 'tell', 'why', 'somebody', 'studying', 'primates', 'jungle', 'would', 'favor', 'apes', 'side', 'human', 'beings', 'might', 'be', 'surprises', 'terms', 'details', 'certainly', 'general', 'idea', 'here', 'clear', 'even', 'actually', 'quot', 'quot', 'answer', 'However', 'be', 'fair', 'film', 'credit', 'not', 'having', 'sexual', 'relationship', 'develop', 'young', 'Dr.', 'Caulder', 'Powell', 'daughter', 'Lyn', 'Maura', 'Tierney', 'Will', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'staring', 'inquisitor', 'prison', 'setting', 'hard', 'not', 'see', 'parallels', 'quot', 'Instinct', 'quot', 'quot', 'Silence', 'Lambs.', 'quot', 'Caulder', 'one', 'point', 'become', 'student', 'as', 'well', 'therapist', '1999', 'film', 'one', 'where', 'patient', 'may', 'well', 'do', 'more', 'doctor', 'other', 'way', 'Added', 'film', 'are', 'standard', 'roster', 'prison', 'goons', 'apathetic', 'doctors', 'eccentric', 'prisoner-patients', 'simplistic', 'combining', 'quot', 'Shawshank', 'Redemption', 'quot', 'quot', 'One', 'Flew', 'Cukoo', 'Nest.', 'quot', 'Consequently', 'Caulder', 'not', 'only', 'bring', 'Powell', 'back', 'sanity', 'family', 'fight', 'reform', 'corrupt', 'system', 'extras', 'DVD', 'consist', 'trailer', 'quot', 'Instinct', 'quot', 'reminder', 'was', 'lot', 'better', 'actual', 'movies', 'then', 'pictures', 'other', 'movies', 'could', 'have', 'watched', 'instead', 'one', 'Apparently', 'someone', 'decision-making', 'capacity', 'recognized', 'most', 'people', 'watching', 'movie', 'were', 'probably', 'hit', 'eject', 'button', 'as', 'soon', 'credits', 'so', 'why', 'waste', 'time', 'money', 'adding', 'extras', 'nobody', 'was', 'going', 'want', 'see']",Instinct VHS

The credential for &quot;Instinct&quot;  is almost flawless but after sitting thru the movie for 2 hours, I was  feeling indifferent despite there were good moments in the movie.

However, the intensity that were expected between Anthony Hopkins  &amp; Cuba Gooding Jr never percipitated.

Subsequently, I couldn't help noticing that the movie  failed to focus onto one issue but trying to be a bit of everything.

While he's  making nicey-nice with the gorillas, a band of hunters attacks the camp,  killing most of their number, a crime for which he is returned to the  states in a strange state of self-imposed silence. Gooding jr. plays the  crack psychiatrist assigned to work with this violently deranged man and  attempt to draw the truth from him about what really happened in the deep  dark jungles of Africa.Any movie that begins with the cerebral Hopkins  singlehandedly demolishing an entire airport terminal, while scores of  armed guards struggle to subdue him, is not destined to register high on  the credibility meter. The screenplay, in fact, degenerates into a  snail-paced series of increasingly ludicrous confrontations between the  deranged killer and the doctor, wherein the psychiatrist, predictably, is  set straight on some eternal verities by the psychotic truth teller. How  often must we be subjected to this idiotic notion that all therapists are  really only trying to work out their own redemptions and that the deeply  emotionally disturbed patients somehow possess the requisite wisdom we mere  rational mortals do not to help them achieve this? The film trods this  tried-and-true path right up to a thoroughly wretched final scene that  defies all credibility and lapses completely into the absurd. At one point,  to achieve his redemption, Gooding Jr. rallies the psychotic prisoners to  band together and stand up against the tyrranical prison forces arrayed  against them - in a scene filled with the kind of phony emotional uplift  that is always backed up by a swelling, sobbing orchestral composition and  endless shots of characters looking meaningfully upward in teary-eyed pride  and determination. If only Jack Nicholson had had such an advocate!Cuba  Gooding Jr., though he certainly tries hard, lacks the gravitas necessary  to carry off a leading role of this magnitude, and Hopkins provides his  customary grating mannerisms as he lectures us about the virtues of  uncivilized, primitive Man. &quot;Instinct&quot; is thoroughly derivative  yet it does have the chutzpah to make momentary fun of itself by including  Sigourney Weaver as the butt of a one-liner. It is the one moment of  cleverness, honesty and courage in an otherwise dull, incredible and  utterly uninteresting film.",1,absurd psychodrama,964742400,"07 28, 2000",2000,2886,"['bottom', 'pop-psychology', 'barrel', 'scraped', 'quot', 'Instinct', 'quot', 'bizarre', 'pointless', 'amalgam', 'quot', 'Silence', 'Lambs', 'quot', 'quot', 'Gorillas', 'Mist', 'quot', 'quot', 'One', 'Flew', 'Cuckoo', 'Nest', 'quot', 'major', 'stumble', 'careers', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'Cuba', 'Gooding', 'Jr.Hopkins', 'research', 'anthropologist', 'who', 'family', 'home', 'eventually', 'sanity', 'take', 'up', 'residence', 'Sigourney', 'Weaver-style', 'family', 'apes', 'course', 'just', 'welcome', 'fully', 'ersatz', 'anthropoid', 'family', 'unit', 'making', 'nicey-nice', 'gorillas', 'band', 'hunters', 'attacks', 'camp', 'killing', 'most', 'number', 'crime', 'returned', 'states', 'strange', 'state', 'self-imposed', 'silence', 'Gooding', 'jr.', 'crack', 'psychiatrist', 'assigned', 'work', 'violently', 'deranged', 'man', 'attempt', 'draw', 'truth', 'what', 'really', 'happened', 'deep', 'dark', 'jungles', 'Africa.Any', 'movie', 'cerebral', 'Hopkins', 'singlehandedly', 'demolishing', 'entire', 'airport', 'terminal', 'scores', 'armed', 'guards', 'struggle', 'subdue', 'not', 'destined', 'register', 'high', 'credibility', 'meter', 'screenplay', 'fact', 'snail-paced', 'series', 'increasingly', 'ludicrous', 'confrontations', 'deranged', 'killer', 'doctor', 'wherein', 'psychiatrist', 'predictably', 'set', 'straight', 'eternal', 'verities', 'psychotic', 'truth', 'teller', 'How', 'often', 'must', 'be', 'subjected', 'idiotic', 'notion', 'therapists', 'are', 'really', 'only', 'trying', 'work', 'out', 'own', 'redemptions', 'deeply', 'emotionally', 'disturbed', 'patients', 'somehow', 'requisite', 'wisdom', 'mere', 'rational', 'mortals', 'do', 'not', 'help', 'achieve', 'film', 'trods', 'tried-and-true', 'path', 'right', 'up', 'thoroughly', 'wretched', 'final', 'scene', 'credibility', 'completely', 'absurd', 'one', 'point', 'achieve', 'redemption', 'Gooding', 'Jr.', 'psychotic', 'prisoners', 'band', 'together', 'stand', 'up', 'tyrranical', 'prison', 'forces', 'arrayed', 'scene', 'filled', 'kind', 'phony', 'emotional', 'uplift', 'always', 'backed', 'up', 'swelling', 'sobbing', 'orchestral', 'composition', 'endless', 'shots', 'characters', 'looking', 'meaningfully', 'upward', 'teary-eyed', 'pride', 'determination', 'only', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'had', 'had', 'advocate', 'Cuba', 'Gooding', 'Jr.', 'certainly', 'hard', 'gravitas', 'necessary', 'carry', 'off', 'leading', 'role', 'magnitude', 'Hopkins', 'customary', 'grating', 'mannerisms', 'virtues', 'uncivilized', 'primitive', 'Man', 'quot', 'Instinct', 'quot', 'thoroughly', 'derivative', 'yet', 'have', 'chutzpah', 'make', 'momentary', 'fun', 'including', 'Sigourney', 'Weaver', 'butt', 'one-liner', 'one', 'moment', 'cleverness', 'honesty', 'courage', 'otherwise', 'dull', 'incredible', 'utterly', 'uninteresting', 'film']",Instinct VHS

INSTINCT gives the viewer bite-sized, puzzle pieces which can be interpreted different ways. The viewer can think and also absorb the information given but can't predict the outcome. INSTINCT ties the story together beautifully with many twists and turns and an interesting, unexpected ending. I personally enjoy a movie which doesn't end sappy but instead, ends with Hope.Kudos to who casted this movie! Dr. Theo Caulder's Desire and Drive so amply played by Cuba Gooding, Jr. is skillfully contrasted with Dr. Ethan Powell's (Hopkins) deep, dark secrets. What a duo they make--they have Chemistry--the magic so rarely seen on the screen. I was thinking near the beginning of the movie that there was no way that Hopkins could top his performance in THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS but he did. He's one of my favorite actors of all time. He makes his characters real and him playing Dr. Ethan Powell is no exception. I've never seen a movie with him in it that I didn't like. And what can I say? Cuba Gooding, Jr. nailed his part.  I can't think of anyone who was more suitable to play Theo. Casting is so important! Donald Sutherland plays the mentor/boss of Theo (Gooding, Jr.); I'm so impressed with every word he spoke and how he said it--he's a seasoned, polished actor. Maura Tierney, who plays the daughter of Dr. Ethan Powell (Hopkins) portrayed both longing and love as well as strength, patience and acceptance.BOTTOM LINE: INSTINCT is a tantalizing, thought-provoking film with much to offer the viewer. If you are a fan of Hopkins, Gooding or Sutherland and/or like psychological thrillers with powerful, emotional intensity and a lesson to learn, buy this.

Dr. Powell, who has been with a group of gorillas during all that time, is not talking at all and seems to be living in a dreamworld. Very slowly, Dr. Calder manages to reach Ethan Powell and starts finding out why Ethan killed two of the poachers. Yet Theo's case is not just about why the murders have happened, but also about how Dr. Powell became the being he is in the first place. With Ethan's silence broken, Theo is introduced into a world beyond common human comprehension: The true nature of being. He learns that mankind's control of everything is a mere illusion and that the true values of existence can't be found so easily. Ethan changes Theo's view of things forever. The strengths in this movie are numerous but it starts with the performances. Hopkins is quietly brilliant as the emotionally traumatized and scarred former anthropologist.

It was a very good movie and Anthony Hopkins is wonderfully persuasive but all the suggestion from ""Ishmael"" there seems to be is just that living in nature is better than living in civilization. There was nothing that indicated the precariousness of civilization - ""takers"" are mentioned but it comes across more as you just don't know what you are missing by being one - not that all of nature has had it. Heck, the movie makers would be shooting their own business in the foot if they were really to try and convince us to head back to the trees. But of course that was the main point of ""Ishmael"".

Gotta see this one, at least once, for experiencing a truly under-rated masterpiece.  My main reason for writing is the inane comments here and fear with reality that pervades our society.  Those who can't, don't or won't appreciate (at least) the marvelous, insightful messages here are possibly the very ones that assure nothing will ever change much .  Scary to shed light on bare essence of humanity's inhumanity and its inability to rise above the systematic base obsessions of power, control and coveting; whether rationalized with all the reasons that endorse continuing to man's lower instincts or from fear of looking beyond the security of ignorance.  It is amazing that the natural order of things may be better balanced and have a wisdom beyond anything man may attain, as he seeks to control nature and fellow man while failing miserably at controlling himself, even with all his knowledge and tech, to a point equal or beyond the inherent natural wisdom of (so called)lower species.Have some fun and enjoy this movie.  It is powerful and as perfect as it gets in addressing very intriguing human societal conundrums while offering quality performances from a great cast on numerous levels.  As a species, we have come so far and grown so little!

470596,A3O536E2YOKK4Y,6305608253,Wuchak,"[0, 0]","What is the main purpose of a movie? To entertain and amuse in one way or another, right? In other words, captivate your attention for the span of the movie's runtime. Great movies do this and something else - they inspire you and make you think; maybe even enlighten. That's the power of the art of film. My wife and I just watched 1999's ""Instinct"" and it does this, which explains my high rating.THE PLOT: Anthropologist Ethan Powell (Anthony Hopkins) goes missing in Africa for a couple of years; when he is found living with gorillas he kills a couple of rangers and injures others. After a year in prison in Africa, where he refuses to speak, he is extradited to a Florida prison and put in the mental ward. A young psychiatrist, Theo Caulder (Cuba Gooding Jr.), is assigned his case to see if he can get him to speak and learn what really happened in Africa. Meanwhile Powell's daughter (Maura Tierney) anticipates reconciling with her father, IF Theo can get through to him.There are some peripheral characters, but that's the gist of the story. Some people criticize it as a mix of ""Gorillas in the Mist"" and ""One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest,"" which is only valid on a surface level. I've seen the latter film (a great film) and ""Instinct"" stands on its own; in fact, it's quite unique, which is a sign of greatness. The movie stands or falls on Hopkins and Cuba Jr making the characters and their story come alive and seem real to the viewer. They succeeded for my wife and me. Within 20 minutes we found ourselves absorbed into the story and the characters.Some people, like Roger Ebert, criticized that the film takes on too many topics or messages, but I never got this impression, nor did my wife. There are the main themes--the limitations of freedom in conventional society and the abuse of controllers (or ""takers"")--and there are a few subthemes, like the flaws of our prisons and mental institutions. The film never confused us or gave the impression that it cut off more than it could chew. If you appreciate films like ""Grand Canyon"" and ""One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest"" you'll probably value ""instinct.""Some criticized one aspect of the climax, but it happens. There are documented examples in the USA and all over the world. Also, keep in mind that Powell was imprisoned in the mental ward of the prison, not the maximum security area.Is the story contrived to some degree? Of course it is; all movies are. Filmmakers have to tell a story and make their points within a limited time frame -- usually around two hours -- and so there are always contrived elements, coincidences, etc. The trick is to pull it off without seeming too phony or forced, which is sometimes hard to do and it takes good actors. Thankfully, ""Instinct"" does a respectable job on this front, perhaps mainly because it has a few great actors, although some viewers may roll their eyes at how the ""ace of diamonds"" subplot is wrapped up. Regardless, it's in the area of ideas that ""Instinct"" towers above most movies.BOTTOM LINE: ""Instinct"" is a psychological drama/thriller that entertains but also makes you think and ponder: How free are we really in society? Are you a giver or a taker? A blesser or an abuser? A liberator or a controller? How can you be freer? How can you escape the manipulations and shackles of others, of society, of ""government""? How can you walk free of ""the game""? And so much more, like the ""doctor"" learning from the patient and the humility it takes to learn from someone who's ""under"" you.The film runs 126 minutes and was shot in central Florida, Uganda and Jamaica.GRADE: A",5,How free are you really?
