Bronco and Sugarfoot.I got this disc because I became a fan of Walker, from seeingsome of the movies he made after his show ended. Even some of his made for tv movies from the 70's were pretty decent!But my complaints about the release of this disc is, that it was so limited. Only three episodes. Why not six, or a complete season.The only other episodes of Cheyenne that I know to exsist, areon vhs. One is titled ""Iron Horse"". The other is ""the White Warior.(featuring a very young Michael Landon.)So If you are a fan of Clint Walker, and would like to see more of the Cheyenne episodes released?Then write to Warner Bros. corperate headquarters, and ask themto release all of the series episodes.

918080,A25QRJQWIAUICD,B000A0GXH4,Luiz A. Sampaio,"[14, 14]","A great release on DVD. Cheyenne was, and still is for those who watched the series back in the 50s and 60s, one of the best and most popular westerns in television history. Big Clint Walker was perfect as Cheyenne Bodie. The show was Warner Brothers first venture into television and the first of a succesfull series of westerns produced by the studio: Maverick (also released on DVD), Sugarfoot, Bronco, Lawman, Colt .45. For this DVD Warner picked up 3 episodes from different seasons (1st, 2nd and 6th). A good choice. We can watch 2 episodes from 1956 and 1 from 1961 and see that the series kept the quality from the beginning to the end of the 7-season running show. Cheyenne remains a classic of the genre. But now, a big complaint! Warner Bros. is celebrating 50 years in television productions, yet the only DVDs released to preserve the memory of Warner's first years on TV were a mere sample of 3 episodes each of Cheyenne and Maverick. This is an extremely poor commemoration of an important event for Warner Brothers. DVDs featuring complete seasons of both Cheyenne and Maverick should be the real and right celebration and an opportunity for the studio to restore the good shows of past years to the new audience.Hey, Clint is still around and some commentary by him on the series would be an excellent extra for the DVD.The ""Disappointed Fan"" review by R. Waddingham was not fair to Warner Bros., neither to the Cheyenne DVD. Mr. Waddingham stated that all three episodes on the DVD have about 15 minutes chopped out. This is not correct. The first episode, The Storm Riders, has a running time of 43 minutes, which is the correct time for all (or most) Cheyenne episodes of the 1st. season, when Warner used some 10 minutes after the show for a ""behind-the-scenes"", promoting the studio movies. The other two episodes are 49 and 50 minutes each. This is the original running time. Nothing was cut. And Ty Hardin was not supposed to star in The Young Fugitives episode. For the 1961-62 season Cheyenne and Bronco alternated as part of The Cheyenne Show, so the ""starring Ty Hardin as Bronco"" in the logo didn't mean at all that Hardin was in the Cheyenne episode.However, the loud question remains unanswered: Why not full seasons for Cheyenne, one the best classic westerns in television history?",5,Cheyenne Bodie Rides Again!,1127779200,"09 27, 2005",2005,2314,"['great', 'release', 'DVD', 'Cheyenne', 'was', 'still', 'who', 'watched', 'series', 'back', '50s', '60s', 'one', 'best', 'most', 'popular', 'westerns', 'television', 'history', 'Big', 'Clint', 'Walker', 'was', 'perfect', 'Cheyenne', 'Bodie', 'show', 'was', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'first', 'venture', 'television', 'first', 'succesfull', 'series', 'westerns', 'produced', 'studio', 'Maverick', 'also', 'released', 'DVD', 'Sugarfoot', 'Bronco', 'Lawman', 'Colt', '.45', 'DVD', 'Warner', 'picked', 'up', '3', 'episodes', 'different', 'seasons', '1st', '2nd', '6th', 'good', 'choice', 'can', 'watch', '2', 'episodes', '1956', '1', '1961', 'see', 'series', 'kept', 'quality', 'beginning', 'end', '7-season', 'running', 'show', 'Cheyenne', 'classic', 'genre', 'now', 'big', 'complaint', 'Warner', 'Bros.', 'celebrating', '50', 'years', 'television', 'productions', 'yet', 'only', 'DVDs', 'released', 'preserve', 'memory', 'Warner', 'first', 'years', 'TV', 'were', 'mere', 'sample', '3', 'episodes', 'Cheyenne', 'Maverick', 'extremely', 'poor', 'commemoration', 'important', 'event', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'DVDs', 'featuring', 'complete', 'seasons', 'Cheyenne', 'Maverick', 'should', 'be', 'real', 'right', 'celebration', 'opportunity', 'studio', 'restore', 'good', 'shows', 'past', 'years', 'new', 'audience.Hey', 'Clint', 'still', 'commentary', 'series', 'would', 'be', 'excellent', 'extra', 'DVD.The', 'Disappointed', 'Fan', 'review', 'R.', 'Waddingham', 'was', 'not', 'fair', 'Warner', 'Bros.', 'neither', 'Cheyenne', 'DVD', 'Mr.', 'Waddingham', 'stated', 'three', 'episodes', 'DVD', 'have', '15', 'minutes', 'chopped', 'out', 'not', 'correct', 'first', 'episode', 'Storm', 'Riders', 'running', 'time', '43', 'minutes', 'correct', 'time', 'most', 'Cheyenne', 'episodes', '1st', 'season', 'when', 'Warner', 'used', '10', 'minutes', 'show', 'behind-the-scenes', 'promoting', 'studio', 'movies', 'other', 'two', 'episodes', 'are', '49', '50', 'minutes', 'original', 'running', 'time', 'Nothing', 'was', 'cut', 'Ty', 'Hardin', 'was', 'not', 'supposed', 'star', 'Young', 'Fugitives', 'episode', '1961-62', 'season', 'Cheyenne', 'Bronco', 'alternated', 'part', 'Cheyenne', 'Show', 'starring', 'Ty', 'Hardin', 'Bronco', 'logo', 'did', ""n't"", 'mean', 'Hardin', 'was', 'Cheyenne', 'episode.However', 'loud', 'question', 'unanswered', 'Why', 'not', 'full', 'seasons', 'Cheyenne', 'one', 'best', 'classic', 'westerns', 'television', 'history']",Cheyenne

One can only hope that this DVD (and the 3-episode ""Maverick"" DVD) sell well enough that more episodes might be made available.  Clint Walker, ""The Big Guy Himself,"" is excellent in this series and some episode commentaries and/or interviews with Mr. Walker would be welcome and important additions for any future DVD releases of ""Cheyenne.""  In this regard, Warner Home Video should have borrowed a page from its subsidiary Rhino Home Video, which released ""The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp"" on the same day as this and included interview material with the star of that series, Hugh O'Brian, along with a more substantial 26 episodes on four DVDs.

It was nice to see at least one season again but these were disappointing in a number of ways and it may very well not be the fault of the current copyright owner. And that is they are all around 40 minutes in length and the theme was different than I had ever heard before, not that shows were beyond changing their theme. The old reliable theme which I was most familiar with was not there and at the very least there should have been some sort of explanation. There wasn't even an explanation that this show alternated with others and therefore was NOT on each week for some 6-8 months of the year for every week. Now, let's see the next few seasons along with the best of them all Maverick which warner has to know is a real gold-mine.
