1530106,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B007EQR0D8,C. Sawin,"[2, 3]","There are times when you can tell quite a bit of thought went into naming a movie i.e. Inception, Super 8, and 50/50. They're titles that perfectly describe the film you're about to see, but have a bit more meaning after seeing them. While other movies jump straight to the point with their titles, which certainly isn't always a bad thing; look at Drive, Moon, and The Crow. All three movies are better known for the acclaim they've received (from both fans and critics) rather than the amount of money they made at the box office. The title of a movie can go a long way, but in certain circumstances it can sum up an entire movie in a handful of words. Man on a Ledge is a prime example of delivering exactly what you're expecting.Nick Cassidy (Sam Worthington) is an ex-con who is trying to convince the world that he's an innocent man, but that's a bit difficult when you break out of prison after serving two years on a thirty year sentence. Instead of talking to a lawyer or taking the advice of his former police comrades, Nick steps out onto the ledge of a building. He wants the world to believe he is innocent or else he's going to paint the asphalt with his insides. Little do they know that Nick's suicide attraction is nothing more than a distraction. Across the street, Nick's brother Joey (Jamie Bell) and his girlfriend Angie (Genesis Rodriguez) are breaking in to steal the $40 million dollar diamond Nick was convicted of stealing. But time is running out and Nick can only stall for so long as Joey and Angie run into some unexpected surprises that weren't a part of the plan.Man on a Ledge just becomes more and more awkward as it drags on. It's as if the movie can't decide what type of story it wants to tell. We follow Nick around for a bit in the present day seeing how the first part of the day panned out before he stepped out onto that ledge, but then we jump back three years to understand why he went to prison. The nonlinear sense of storytelling is fine, but it feels a bit out of place when it's used so early on in a film without ever really returning to that format again. Then the pacing becomes a huge issue. Man on a Ledge is very go-go-go the entire movie and it never really gives you enough time to properly process everything or let you really care about these characters. You're aware of the situation, the heist going on next door, the apparent corruption in the police force, and the fact that time is running out right from the start, but it just doesn't really matter. There's no character development as everybody feels so paper thin. Even Sam Worthington can't keep his American accent going the entire movie as his Australian accent seems much more apparent in the second half. It just comes off as a complete mess.The other problem this crime thriller has is the fact you never really know who to pull for. You've got three people trying to pull off a heist claiming it's to prove one of them is innocent of a crime they went to prison for while an unsolved investigation concerning the police force comes up during Nick's suicide attempt to let them know that somebody on the force has been working for David Englander (played by Ed Harris and who was the main reason Nick went to prison) the entire time. Without much depth to the characters, you never really want to see either side succeed. Through all of Nick's pleading with negotiator Lydia Mercer (Elizabeth Banks), the wire he's wearing in his ear becomes blatantly obvious. So her shock and surprise to its reveal later on seems more sarcastic than anything. To make matters worse, things stay this way nearly the entire time until the closing moments where every question you have is answered in the last five minutes. Man on a Ledge has some of the worst pacing to ever make it to the screen.The only real redeemable factor of the movie is Ed Harris, but it's more of his character being so bad and cheesy that he's good. The scene where his character is introduced where he's given a watch by a colleague is hilarious for all of the wrong reasons.Man on a Ledge is a combination of many movies you've seen before and it feels that way. It's a mishmash of ideas taken from movies like Die Hard, 16 Blocks, and Hostage. Oh wait; maybe it just borrows ideas from Bruce Willis movies. With its ridiculous pacing and even more incongruous ending, Man on a Ledge will invoke you with the urge to use some of that nonlinear storytelling to go back to the beginning of the movie and push Nick off that building yourself to help prevent you from seeing such buffoonery.",2,Beating around the bush,1327536000,"01 26, 2012",2012,4573,"['are', 'times', 'when', 'can', 'tell', 'quite', 'bit', 'thought', 'went', 'naming', 'movie', 'i.e', 'Inception', 'Super', '8', '50/50', ""'re"", 'titles', 'perfectly', 'film', ""'re"", 'see', 'have', 'bit', 'more', 'meaning', 'seeing', 'other', 'movies', 'jump', 'straight', 'point', 'titles', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'always', 'bad', 'thing', 'Drive', 'Moon', 'Crow', 'three', 'movies', 'are', 'better', 'known', 'acclaim', ""'ve"", 'received', 'fans', 'critics', 'rather', 'amount', 'money', 'made', 'box', 'office', 'title', 'movie', 'can', 'go', 'long', 'way', 'certain', 'circumstances', 'can', 'sum', 'up', 'entire', 'movie', 'handful', 'words', 'Man', 'Ledge', 'prime', 'example', 'delivering', 'exactly', 'what', ""'re"", 'expecting.Nick', 'Cassidy', 'Sam', 'Worthington', 'ex-con', 'who', 'trying', 'convince', 'world', 'innocent', 'man', 'bit', 'difficult', 'when', 'break', 'prison', 'serving', 'two', 'years', 'thirty', 'year', 'sentence', 'Instead', 'talking', 'lawyer', 'taking', 'advice', 'former', 'police', 'comrades', 'Nick', 'out', 'ledge', 'building', 'world', 'believe', 'innocent', 'else', 'going', 'paint', 'asphalt', 'insides', 'Little', 'do', 'know', 'Nick', 'suicide', 'attraction', 'nothing', 'more', 'distraction', 'street', 'Nick', 'brother', 'Joey', 'Jamie', 'Bell', 'girlfriend', 'Angie', 'Genesis', 'Rodriguez', 'are', 'breaking', 'steal', '40', 'million', 'dollar', 'diamond', 'Nick', 'was', 'convicted', 'stealing', 'time', 'running', 'out', 'Nick', 'can', 'only', 'stall', 'so', 'long', 'Joey', 'Angie', 'run', 'unexpected', 'surprises', 'were', ""n't"", 'part', 'plan.Man', 'Ledge', 'just', 'more', 'more', 'awkward', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'decide', 'what', 'type', 'story', 'tell', 'follow', 'Nick', 'bit', 'present', 'day', 'seeing', 'how', 'first', 'part', 'day', 'panned', 'out', 'stepped', 'out', 'ledge', 'then', 'jump', 'back', 'three', 'years', 'understand', 'why', 'went', 'prison', 'nonlinear', 'sense', 'storytelling', 'fine', 'bit', 'place', 'when', 'used', 'so', 'early', 'film', 'ever', 'really', 'returning', 'format', 'again', 'Then', 'pacing', 'huge', 'issue', 'Man', 'Ledge', 'very', 'go-go-go', 'entire', 'movie', 'never', 'really', 'enough', 'time', 'properly', 'process', 'everything', 'let', 'really', 'care', 'characters', ""'re"", 'aware', 'situation', 'heist', 'going', 'next', 'door', 'apparent', 'corruption', 'police', 'force', 'fact', 'time', 'running', 'out', 'right', 'start', 'just', ""n't"", 'really', 'matter', 'character', 'development', 'everybody', 'feels', 'so', 'paper', 'thin', 'Even', 'Sam', 'Worthington', 'ca', ""n't"", 'keep', 'American', 'accent', 'going', 'entire', 'movie', 'Australian', 'accent', 'much', 'more', 'apparent', 'second', 'half', 'just', 'off', 'complete', 'mess.The', 'other', 'problem', 'crime', 'thriller', 'fact', 'never', 'really', 'know', 'who', 'pull', ""'ve"", 'got', 'three', 'people', 'trying', 'pull', 'off', 'heist', 'claiming', 'prove', 'one', 'innocent', 'crime', 'went', 'prison', 'unsolved', 'investigation', 'concerning', 'police', 'force', 'up', 'Nick', 'suicide', 'attempt', 'let', 'know', 'somebody', 'force', 'been', 'working', 'David', 'Englander', 'played', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'who', 'was', 'main', 'reason', 'Nick', 'went', 'prison', 'entire', 'time', 'much', 'depth', 'characters', 'never', 'really', 'want', 'see', 'side', 'succeed', 'Nick', 'pleading', 'negotiator', 'Lydia', 'Mercer', 'Elizabeth', 'Banks', 'wire', 'wearing', 'ear', 'becomes', 'blatantly', 'obvious', 'shock', 'surprise', 'reveal', 'later', 'more', 'sarcastic', 'anything', 'make', 'matters', 'worse', 'things', 'stay', 'way', 'nearly', 'entire', 'time', 'closing', 'moments', 'where', 'question', 'have', 'answered', 'last', 'five', 'minutes', 'Man', 'Ledge', 'worst', 'pacing', 'ever', 'make', 'screen.The', 'only', 'real', 'redeemable', 'factor', 'movie', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'more', 'character', 'being', 'so', 'bad', 'cheesy', 'good', 'scene', 'where', 'character', 'introduced', 'where', 'given', 'watch', 'colleague', 'hilarious', 'wrong', 'reasons.Man', 'Ledge', 'combination', 'many', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'way', 'mishmash', 'ideas', 'taken', 'movies', 'Die', 'Hard', '16', 'Blocks', 'Hostage', 'Oh', 'wait', 'just', 'ideas', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'movies', 'ridiculous', 'pacing', 'even', 'more', 'incongruous', 'ending', 'Man', 'Ledge', 'will', 'invoke', 'urge', 'use', 'nonlinear', 'storytelling', 'go', 'back', 'beginning', 'movie', 'push', 'Nick', 'off', 'building', 'help', 'prevent', 'seeing', 'such', 'buffoonery']",N/A

After an expensive dinner and champagne, he writes a note... and climbs out the window onto a narrow stone ledge.Welcome to the scenario that opens ""Man on a Ledge,"" which is literally about a man sitting on a ledge to try to prove his innocence. The idea isn't half bad, but the casting of the eternally blank-faced Sam Worthington pretty much deflates the intensity -- the rest of the cast is quite good, but when the plot hinges around a person sitting on a ledge, they better be good.Two years ago, Nick Cassidy (Sam Worthington) was accused of stealing a massive diamond from wealthy businessman David Englander (Ed Harris), and was sentenced to 25 years. When he's allowed a day out for his father's funeral, Nick escapes from his guards, picks up a cache of money and other supplies, and checks into the hotel. See above description of what happens.Expecting a suicidal jumper, a massive crowd forms below, while the police try to figure out who Cassidy is and why he's up there. He refuses to talk to anyone except depressed negotiator Lydia Mercer (Elizabeth Banks). But unknown to the cops, Nick's younger brother Joey (Jamie Bell) and Joey's girlfriend Angie (G&eacute;nesis Rodr&iacute;guez) are infiltrating a nearby building, where they plan to prove his innocence -- by stealing the missing diamond.""Man on a Ledge"" is another one of those movies that might have been simply sublime... if Alfred Hitchcock weren't dead. It has an intriguing idea, and a challenge that most Hollywood movies won't set up for themselves -- what if the hero of the piece barely ever moved from the ledge he's standing on, holding himself hostage in front of all of New York City?So how does this movie fail? That would be Sam Worthington. This man has the acting ability of a tortoise who just smoked a giant bag of weed -- he never registers any emotions like fear, anxiety, rage or depression. Actually, he barely registers any emotions, period. It's like watching a lifelike robot trying to imitate humans, and failing.A role like this one needs Christian Bale, Jeremy Renner, (de-aged) Liam Neeson, Colin Farrell or Matt Damon, all of whom could pull off a disgraced cop going to desperate lengths to restore his life. But with Worthington up on the ledge, all feeling of tension is just sucked out of the central storyline. He's not even sweating!Director Asger Leth actually does a lot better when he's focusing on anything other than the titular man on a ledge -- the infiltration into the vault is a genuinely tense sequence, with some clever twists along the way. However, I found myself a little baffled by the depiction of the people watching Cassidy. For some reason, the crowd of rubberneckers suddenly turns Cassidy into a hero for the common man... even though they don't really know much about what's going on. It feels awkward and is never really explained.The rest of the actors are pretty decent -- Jamie Bell and Elizabeth Bell give excellent smaller performances, especially since Bell is playing a woman haunted by a failure to talk down a suicidal cop. Ed Harris is something of a cardboard villain though, and Kyra Sedgwick is utterly wasted as an annoying TV reporter who... reports.The man on a ledge is the weakest point in ""Man on a Ledge"" -- which is a shame, because a strong, talented actor in that role could have made this a wonderfully memorable movie. As it is, it just reminds me of what happens when tortoises get stoned.",2,"""We got a man on a ledge""",1364774400,"04 1, 2013",2013,3511,"['man', 'luxury', 'hotel', 'name', 'Walker', 'expensive', 'dinner', 'champagne', 'note', 'climbs', 'out', 'window', 'narrow', 'stone', 'ledge.Welcome', 'scenario', 'Man', 'Ledge', 'literally', 'man', 'sitting', 'ledge', 'try', 'prove', 'innocence', 'idea', ""n't"", 'half', 'bad', 'casting', 'eternally', 'blank-faced', 'Sam', 'Worthington', 'pretty', 'much', 'intensity', 'rest', 'cast', 'quite', 'good', 'when', 'plot', 'person', 'sitting', 'ledge', 'better', 'be', 'good.Two', 'years', 'ago', 'Nick', 'Cassidy', 'Sam', 'Worthington', 'was', 'accused', 'stealing', 'massive', 'diamond', 'wealthy', 'businessman', 'David', 'Englander', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'was', 'sentenced', '25', 'years', 'When', 'allowed', 'day', 'out', 'father', 'funeral', 'Nick', 'guards', 'up', 'cache', 'money', 'other', 'supplies', 'checks', 'hotel', 'See', 'description', 'what', 'happens.Expecting', 'suicidal', 'jumper', 'massive', 'crowd', 'forms', 'police', 'try', 'figure', 'out', 'who', 'Cassidy', 'why', 'up', 'there', 'talk', 'anyone', 'depressed', 'negotiator', 'Lydia', 'Mercer', 'Elizabeth', 'Banks', 'unknown', 'cops', 'Nick', 'younger', 'brother', 'Joey', 'Jamie', 'Bell', 'Joey', 'girlfriend', 'Angie', 'G', 'eacute', 'Rodr', 'iacute', 'guez', 'are', 'infiltrating', 'nearby', 'building', 'where', 'plan', 'prove', 'innocence', 'stealing', 'missing', 'diamond', 'Man', 'Ledge', 'one', 'movies', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'simply', 'sublime', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'were', ""n't"", 'dead', 'intriguing', 'idea', 'challenge', 'most', 'Hollywood', 'movies', 'wo', ""n't"", 'set', 'up', 'what', 'hero', 'piece', 'barely', 'ever', 'moved', 'ledge', 'standing', 'holding', 'hostage', 'front', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'So', 'how', 'movie', 'fail', 'would', 'be', 'Sam', 'Worthington', 'man', 'acting', 'ability', 'tortoise', 'who', 'just', 'smoked', 'giant', 'bag', 'weed', 'never', 'emotions', 'fear', 'anxiety', 'rage', 'depression', 'Actually', 'barely', 'emotions', 'period', 'watching', 'lifelike', 'robot', 'trying', 'imitate', 'humans', 'failing.A', 'role', 'one', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'Jeremy', 'Renner', 'de-aged', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'whom', 'could', 'pull', 'off', 'disgraced', 'cop', 'going', 'desperate', 'lengths', 'restore', 'life', 'Worthington', 'up', 'ledge', 'feeling', 'tension', 'just', 'sucked', 'central', 'storyline', 'not', 'even', 'sweating', 'Director', 'Asger', 'Leth', 'actually', 'lot', 'better', 'when', 'focusing', 'anything', 'other', 'titular', 'man', 'ledge', 'infiltration', 'vault', 'genuinely', 'tense', 'sequence', 'clever', 'twists', 'way', 'However', 'found', 'little', 'baffled', 'depiction', 'people', 'watching', 'Cassidy', 'reason', 'crowd', 'rubberneckers', 'suddenly', 'Cassidy', 'hero', 'common', 'man', 'even', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'know', 'much', 'what', 'going', 'awkward', 'never', 'really', 'explained.The', 'rest', 'actors', 'are', 'pretty', 'decent', 'Jamie', 'Bell', 'Elizabeth', 'Bell', 'give', 'excellent', 'smaller', 'performances', 'especially', 'Bell', 'playing', 'woman', 'haunted', 'failure', 'talk', 'down', 'suicidal', 'cop', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'something', 'cardboard', 'villain', 'Kyra', 'Sedgwick', 'utterly', 'wasted', 'annoying', 'TV', 'reporter', 'who', 'reports.The', 'man', 'ledge', 'weakest', 'point', 'Man', 'Ledge', 'shame', 'strong', 'talented', 'actor', 'role', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'wonderfully', 'memorable', 'movie', 'just', 'what', 'when', 'tortoises', 'get', 'stoned']",N/A

In addition, he requests who he wishes to speak to about the crime he was accused of. The woman he requested has a reputation of not being the perfect detective, or a good negotiator. However, it's as good as it gets when Ms. Banks steps in to save the day. A clever game begins with the NYPD, and the accused.

1530129,A328S9RN3U5M68,B007EQR0D8,Grady Harp,"[1, 2]","Starting with a tightly woven story and screenplay by Pablo F. Fenjves and directed with an eye and an ear on tension by Asger Leth MAN ON A LEDGE provides on of the best suspense/caper heist/intrigue/good cop-bad cop movies to come out in a long time. The pacing of this remarkable story is such that it speeds by so quickly that the audience feels like the movie is very short - and that is even with the fact that there is a history of the main character shared in flashbacks, and an upfront suspenseful tale out in the open with a simultaneous heist going sub rosa.  No one is who they seem to be on the surface and as the story unwinds we are able to discover a very deeply embedded history of a man on a ledge.Nick Cassidy (Sam Worthington at his best) checks into the Roosevelt Hotel in New York City, orders a champagne breakfast and then steps out on the very high ledge to begin the tale. A screaming woman from the street spies him and police surround the hotel, providing a trampoline for the victim to jump to safety. But Nick demands from the cop assigned (Edward Burns) that a particular negotiator be assigned to talk with him - that negotiator is boozily disgraced Lydia Mercer (Elizabeth Banks). Mercer takes charge, identifies with Cassidy's plight and forces her fellow policemen to leave the situation to her.  Meanwhile we discover Cassidy's brother Joey (Jamie Bell) and his girlfriend Angie (Genesis Rodriguez) are in the building across the street, breaking in and performing an incredible heist for a 40 carat diamond owned by criminally minded David Englander (Ed Harris): flashbacks reveal that Cassidy had been imprisoned as a bad cop who allegedly stole that diamond and has escaped form prison to prove his innocence. The action goes back and forth between Cassidy and Mercer in their talks and Joey and Angie and their progress and Englander and the dirty cops assisting him, Gradually the true colors of all the people are revealed in a fine, startling way.The cast is exceptionally fine, with smaller roles being ably played by Anthony Mackie, Kyra Sedgwick, Pooja Kumar, William Sadler, Titus Welliver and others. For once a film is a true suspense story that keeps the audience riveted to their seats. The top notch cinematography is by Paul Cameron an the musical score is by Henry Jackman.

Teslovich,"[10, 15]","First alert to a clich&eacute; written movie is the use of a prolonged opening scene of a helicopter overhead view of cars and buildings below (unless it's in the country then it's trees and a winding road). Clich&eacute; continues with another crime thriller that has lots of stereotypes and portrayals that lack believability. Bad guy businessman looks like bad guy - mafia style (Shouldn't they really just look like ordinary bankers and financial advisors?); cops look and talk like Hollywood cops including the obligatory attractive female cop and African-American cop as a counterpoint to dumb partners. Poorly written and fragmented storyline of a double crossed cop looking to prove his innocence. The unbelievable parts come in droves of scenes starting with that cop and his highly unlikely planned escape from prison during a funeral then, despite not wearing a seat belt, the car he escapes in is demolished by a train and he just runs away with no marks, not even on his clothing. His co-conspirators who could have spent their lives as department store sales people end up having an arsenal of special ops equipment which allows them to break into a bank like professional cat buglers and steal a $40 million dollar diamond. The usual disarming of security cameras and motion sensors; manipulating codes; accessing electrical circuits and crawling through ceiling access spaces. How repetitively redundant, if not stolen, from countless other movies with the same hooks. The escaped cop makes himself a suicide decoy to the heist that is taking place next door and then somehow escapes from the dozen cops that surround him.

Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[1, 1]","""Living life too close to the edgeHoping that I know the ledge..."" - Rakim(There, I've always wanted to quote the best rapper who ever smoked a mic. So that's one off the bucket list.)A man on a ledge frequently lacks conviction. A man on a ledge seeks attention, maybe wants a hug. If he were gonna jump, he already would've. Nick Cassidy (Sam Worthington), ex-cop and current convict at large, is banking on someone deploying the fuzz and the NYPD negotiator to try to talk him off the ledge. Nick's scheme absolutely hinges on it.A month ago he was serving out his 25-year sentence at the Sing Sing Correctional Facility. Today, on the corner of 45th & Madison, perched precariously on the narrow ledge off the Roosevelt Hotel's 21st floor, Nick is working on a bit of misdirection. Sent up the river for the theft of a $40 million diamond, he's eyeing the malevolent corporate baron (Ed Harris) what done him wrong, what set him up. Should I mention that this baron's sanctum sanctorum stands within spitting distance of the Roosevelt Hotel? Nick way up there soon collects a massive crowd way down there. Traffic halts, ruckus is raised, fingers point, the vapid news reporter pounces, cell phones record for YouTube posterity. The fuzz rolls up. So does the frazzled negotiator (Elizabeth Banks). The film gets off to a promising start. Up to that point I was all in.MAN ON A LEDGE delivers an effective sense of vertigo and some nice suspenseful moments. It's better than TOWER HEIST, the most recent I'd seen from this genre. I guess how much you like this film depends on how convincingly it sells you on the series of farfetched events that must fall in place for Nick's plan to work, the first step of which involves his being allowed to attend his father's funeral and from there making a getaway. Most of the film has Nick on that ledge, stalling and stalling and stalling. Eventually, the negotiator and the other fuzz glom on to Nick's delaying tactics. But, by that time, a sort of inertia had already set in.Nick's scenes would've come across better had the parallel plot thread been more interesting or, more importantly, if the script had been tighter. The second storyline tracks a break-in of a nearby building. Except that the two characters in that narrative seem trapped in a loop of unanticipated mishaps. After a while, it felt like stalling, too. I do like bickering couple Jamie Bell and Genesis Rodriguez. As a bonus, the feisty Rodriguez crawls around in ventilation shafts in a catsuit. I must say that I find the women characters in this film more interesting than their male counterparts. It doesn't hurt that both Banks and Rodriguez are smoking hot. Meanwhile, Sam Worthington's Australian accent slips in occasionally, which is jarring. But give him props for this: That's him on location, out on that ledge high up at the Roosevelt Hotel. Not bad for a guy who goes thru bouts of acrophobia. Overall, I rate MAN ON A LEDGE 3.5 out of 5 stars. It's a perfectly serviceable caper thriller, with some taut nerve-janglers and one final twist at the end. But does Nick Cassidy ever sort out his frame-up about that diamond? I dunno. Maybe he does. Mostly, what's running thru my mind are images of a tough-talking but fragile police psychologist and an amateur break-in artist slinking along in that catsuit. Oh, and Ed Harris is real good as the big bad.The DVD's bonus stuff:- ""The Ledge"" featurette (00:15:17 minutes)- Trailer with commentary by Elizabeth Banks",4,...this hotel offers a really good view...,1354924800,"12 8, 2012",2012,3496,"['Living', 'life', 'too', 'close', 'edgeHoping', 'know', 'ledge', 'Rakim', ""'ve"", 'always', 'wanted', 'quote', 'best', 'rapper', 'who', 'ever', 'smoked', 'mic', 'one', 'bucket', 'list', 'man', 'ledge', 'frequently', 'conviction', 'man', 'ledge', 'seeks', 'attention', 'maybe', 'hug', 'were', 'gon', 'jump', 'already', 'would', ""'ve"", 'Nick', 'Cassidy', 'Sam', 'Worthington', 'ex-cop', 'current', 'convict', 'large', 'banking', 'someone', 'deploying', 'fuzz', 'NYPD', 'negotiator', 'try', 'talk', 'off', 'ledge', 'Nick', 'scheme', 'absolutely', 'it.A', 'month', 'was', 'serving', 'out', '25-year', 'sentence', 'Sing', 'Sing', 'Correctional', 'Facility', 'Today', 'corner', '45th', 'Madison', 'perched', 'precariously', 'narrow', 'ledge', 'Roosevelt', 'Hotel', '21st', 'floor', 'Nick', 'working', 'bit', 'misdirection', 'Sent', 'up', 'river', 'theft', '40', 'million', 'diamond', 'eyeing', 'malevolent', 'corporate', 'baron', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'what', 'done', 'wrong', 'what', 'set', 'up', 'Should', 'mention', 'baron', 'sanctum', 'sanctorum', 'spitting', 'distance', 'Roosevelt', 'Hotel', 'Nick', 'way', 'there', 'soon', 'massive', 'crowd', 'way', 'there', 'Traffic', 'halts', 'ruckus', 'raised', 'fingers', 'point', 'vapid', 'news', 'reporter', 'pounces', 'cell', 'phones', 'record', 'YouTube', 'posterity', 'fuzz', 'up', 'So', 'frazzled', 'negotiator', 'Elizabeth', 'Banks', 'film', 'off', 'promising', 'start', 'Up', 'point', 'was', 'in.MAN', 'LEDGE', 'delivers', 'effective', 'sense', 'vertigo', 'nice', 'suspenseful', 'moments', 'better', 'TOWER', 'HEIST', 'most', 'recent', ""'d"", 'seen', 'genre', 'guess', 'how', 'much', 'film', 'how', 'convincingly', 'series', 'farfetched', 'events', 'must', 'fall', 'place', 'Nick', 'plan', 'work', 'first', 'step', 'being', 'allowed', 'attend', 'father', 'funeral', 'making', 'getaway', 'Most', 'film', 'Nick', 'ledge', 'stalling', 'stalling', 'stalling', 'Eventually', 'negotiator', 'other', 'fuzz', 'glom', 'Nick', 'delaying', 'tactics', 'time', 'sort', 'inertia', 'had', 'already', 'set', 'in.Nick', 'scenes', 'would', ""'ve"", 'come', 'better', 'had', 'parallel', 'plot', 'thread', 'been', 'more', 'interesting', 'more', 'importantly', 'script', 'had', 'been', 'tighter', 'second', 'storyline', 'break-in', 'nearby', 'building', 'two', 'characters', 'narrative', 'seem', 'trapped', 'loop', 'unanticipated', 'mishaps', 'while', 'felt', 'stalling', 'too', 'do', 'bickering', 'couple', 'Jamie', 'Bell', 'Genesis', 'Rodriguez', 'bonus', 'feisty', 'Rodriguez', 'crawls', 'around', 'ventilation', 'shafts', 'catsuit', 'must', 'say', 'find', 'women', 'characters', 'film', 'more', 'interesting', 'male', 'counterparts', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'Banks', 'Rodriguez', 'are', 'smoking', 'hot', 'Meanwhile', 'Sam', 'Worthington', 'Australian', 'accent', 'slips', 'occasionally', 'jarring', 'give', 'props', 'location', 'ledge', 'high', 'up', 'Roosevelt', 'Hotel', 'Not', 'bad', 'guy', 'who', 'thru', 'bouts', 'acrophobia', 'Overall', 'rate', 'MAN', 'ON', 'A', 'LEDGE', '3.5', '5', 'stars', 'perfectly', 'serviceable', 'caper', 'thriller', 'taut', 'nerve-janglers', 'one', 'final', 'twist', 'end', 'Nick', 'Cassidy', 'ever', 'sort', 'out', 'frame-up', 'diamond', 'dunno', 'Maybe', 'Mostly', 'what', 'running', 'thru', 'mind', 'are', 'images', 'tough-talking', 'fragile', 'police', 'psychologist', 'amateur', 'break-in', 'artist', 'slinking', 'along', 'catsuit', 'Oh', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'real', 'good', 'big', 'bad.The', 'DVD', 'bonus', 'stuff', 'Ledge', 'featurette', '00:15:17', 'minutes', 'Trailer', 'commentary', 'Elizabeth', 'Banks']",N/A

Proceed with caution.Man On A Ledge starts with Nick Cassidy, played by Sam Worthington, checking into a hotel and walking out onto the ledge of his room's window. I thought this was a very odd way to start the movie, I felt like they just jumped to something I thought was going to be a major scene, but as the movie went on it was clear this was the best place to put this scene. After he gets on the ledge there's a flashback of his father's funeral, and his escape from prison. So we learn he's an escaped convict, but we don't know why he was convicted. As the movie goes on we learn he's trying to prove that not only is he innocent, but he was set up.As the movie progressed the writing seemed to go back and forth between good and stale. There were some really well written scenes, but then you had some that were really unbelievable. The dialogue, for the most part, I felt was well written and, at some parts, very clever. Especially when he was having to talk to Joey (Jamie Bell) and Angela (G&eacute;nesis Rodr&iacute;guez) at the same time he was talking to Lydia (Elizabeth Banks) I felt that whole scene was extremely well done.Going into the movie I had no real idea what the story was about. Obviously you had a man on the ledge, and from the trailer it looked like a man trying to prove his innocence, but that's all you really know. Which is why I was so surprised at how much I actually enjoyed it. Sometimes knowing as little as possible while going into a movie makes it that much better. The same thing happened when I watched ""Safe House"" recently. I had no idea what it was about, and I loved it.Finally, I don't know who G&eacute;nesis Rodr&iacute;guez is, but oh my god is she sexy. She has a scene where she's changing and you see her standing in her undergarments and she has a body that will make your jaw drop. I'll definitely be on the lookout for more of her in the future.Overall Score: 7/10 - What we have here is a good movie with some good acting.

Elizabeth Banks, Ed Harris, Ed Burns...all excellent.  I was also excited to see Sam Worthington, who I found excellent in Avatar and Terminator Salvation.The story follows Nick Cassidy (Worthington), who is an ex-cop convicted of stealing a very precious stone from a rich developer (Harris).  Cassidy attempts to clear his name by climbing out onto the ledge of a hotel in New York in the middle of the day.  This, however, is just a distraction so that his brother (played by the ever-adorable Jamie Bell, aka ""Billy Elliot"") can break into the developer's vault to find the missing stone.  The negotiator (Banks) tries to talk Cassidy off the ledge but soon realizes that something else is going on.I thought this was a fun movie but it was missing something.  Worthington just isn't the dynamic lead man that I expected.

Released to go to his dad's funeral, he manages to escape with the help of his brother (Jamie Bell) and brother's girlfriend (Genesis Rodriguez).With the intricately orchestrated precision of a Navy Seal team, Nick traverses the ledge of a New York skyscraper, threatening to jump while Joey (Bell) and Angie (Rodriguez) break into a nearby building that contains the offices of Englander (Harris).

There are only 4 cops prominent in the film so you have a 50/50 chance of figuring out who the dirty ones are even if you're not paying attention.The movie boils down to a pretty standard heist movie without the humor.  Elizabeth Banks tries to liven things up as the cop who tries to talk Nick off the ledge and with their byplay it's pretty easy to see where that relationship will ultimately end up.

1530181,A1F93NA8HQ47IU,B007EQR0D8,"Reconnecting To My Childhood ""Time Won't Let ...","[1, 2]","It has a great start but then it starts to wobble and whether or not you will ultimately enjoy it depends on you and your expectations. This film can be considered standard January fare, a nice concept but not grand or high concept enough for a blockbuster. It aims more to entertain than to be a real standout film. I suspected all this going in. Understanding this I was still slightly disappointed that a film that starts out with a consistent, though heightened, reality eventually starts jumping all over the place tonally to facilitate plot twists.What is good? The directing may not be great as the film has an increasingly unsteady pacing as it goes on, something a director could have controlled, but I fully compliment the cinematography. The shots on the confined ledge feel genuine and fun, they appropriately make the viewer feel slightly uneasy even though you know it's all fine (there is a scene where Worthington fakes the motion of jumping to rile of the crowd, very well done). The heist scenes are suspenseful and well timed. The one shot I didn't enjoy was one where a poorly computer generated camera move goes from the ledge twirling down to the street in an attempt to simulate what a fall might be like, it just looked like outdated CGI of the buildings twirling, not sure why they didn't try and do it practically.I would also argue that the film is well cast overall:Sam Worthington is the newer leading man on the scene lately, he is enjoyable if not perfect for the role of a previous New York Police Officer. I enjoyed his acting but his accent shifted between his attempt at an American, to what I sensed as an awkward attempt at a New Yawker, back to his natural Aussie most of the time. Despite the accent issues always in the back of my mind, I enjoyed his performance and he seems to be having fun in the part.Elizabeth Banks has always been a favorite of mine, I just wish she would get offered some better roles and better lines to deliver. The real flaw with her character is that what starts out as an interestingly developed character with some history and obstacles to overcome suddenly gets lost in a woman who has to immediately jump on board with some crazy ideas losing all the skepticism she had less than a minute before, and with little to no justification.Jamie Bell is almost always enjoyable and does his best making this part real fun, even if the character is the most underdeveloped. We learn almost nothing about him other than that he is playing Worthington's brother. There is no history, no explanation of how he pulls off the feats he does, no explanation of what compelled him to get involved or why he involved his girlfriend, apparently he does these things just because it's his brother. It is nevertheless fun to watch him play out the situation. Bell and the very attractive, relative newcomer, Genesis Rodriguezhis, who plays his girlfriend, are fun to watch, especially as a team. They actually act somewhat like people who aren't professionals would. They stumble, they drop things, they look anxious and scared. It's a heightened reality for sure but even their out of place lovers quarrels felt fun and in the universe of the film (until the film abandons the universe it established about halfway through).Another good point is the film is having fun all the way through. Right from the start the film establishes this is a heightened reality where the audience can laugh, so I had no problem at many jokes placed directly in the climax of the film. Early on the crowd make comments that essentially poke fun at the situation and how a desensitized population would deal with it. I laughed aloud when a homeless man started trying to get the crowd to shout Attica! Attica! (an obvious reference to Al Pacino's ad lib in Dog Day Afternoon) but this time no one cheered along and the cops silenced him, hahaha. Still the humor doesn't help when the film starts making unjustified turns too quickly.What is Bad? I've sort of already said above, the plot builds on what seems to be an interesting premise set in a realistic sort of reality. It then suddenly abandons much of that in order to throw on some unneeded twists and it starts requiring characters to do things that they would never be able to justify, even in the heightened reality established at the beginning of the film. It's like they thought, ""we explained how the characters do things in the beginning, now we can just show the results"". This is in part due to a script that could've used a few more rewrites and some more steady throughlines. It's too bad but I still didn't mind watching it, even though I'd never feel compelled to watch the second half again, I would probably rewatch the beginning and the heist scenes if I scrolled past them on the movie channel. Oh, I don't want to spoil anything for those who might see it for fun, but there is one plot twist regarding a hotel worker that I suspected but hoped against-- unfortunately the hope was in vein. The twist came and was only granted a reveal in the last minute of the film with no actual explanation, which made me wonder why they decided to add it.Ultimately I really wanted to love this as a January film, I hoped I might even want to buy it as I love the actors and New York. I also had hope for the familiar yet differently approached premise. However the film sort of goes too far out of its own way, becoming more of a parody of the type of thriller it starts out as. I liked the film but it never went past that once the established universe was betrayed. The fun acting and decent cinematography are enough for me to recommend it to those who just want a fun escapism experience (say if you enjoyed Law Abiding Citizen, Tower Heist, etc. this may be one you'll like or even love). I also recommend it to those who like the actors enough to just want to see them having fun, outside of that though I would say don't expect a serious story or any form of consistent tone in the second half. Those who like tonally consistent but heightened films like Dog Day Afternoon, Die Hard or even Panic Room, you will likely be unhappy with this.I leave it up to each individual, if this doesn't sound like it's for you then there are plenty of other more consistent films in theaters. If it sounds fun to you, give it a chance, it's worth the one viewing at least.4 stars (really 3.5 leaning closer to 4) from me because I liked watching it, I just wish I could've liked the movie

I remember seeing the trailer to this movie in another bomb, The Darkest Hour. I thought to myself, ""Wow, what a stupid title. Hollywood has really gone down, but it does actually look like a pretty good movie."" So anyways I went to see it the first weekend. Surprisingly this stupid titled movie, was very entertaining. Sam worthington is very good and convincing as a man that will do anything to prove his innocence, after he was convicted of robbing Ed Harris of his prized diamond. What we get in return is an action packed roller coaster ride of false accusations, stealth attacks, and happy family reunions. Now you can obviously predict that there are a lot of plot holes. Like when Sam worthington escapes from prison, he is not exactly immediately chased, but is just kind of slowly followed. But anyway, this is a stellar movie, that you probably don't remember because it was really only out in theatres for what seemed liked two weeks. That's of course just an exaggeration, but no one saw this movie. Probably a little bit more thinking could've gone into the title to make it a little more appealing, but what this title really doesn't tell you is that this an exciting action movie, not just a movie about a loners attempt at suicide.

1530208,A1KMG1AIUS00DC,B007EQR0D8,"The Movie Man ""tenebre89""","[40, 48]","""Man on a Ledge"" is a movie in which a man contemplates jumping to his death.  Who is he?  Why is this his chosen method of suicide?  And why  is he so insistent on dealing with a particular police negotiator?Nick Cassidy (Sam Worthington) is an escaped, convicted diamond thief with an elaborate plan to clear his name.  After checking into an upper-floor room at Manhattan's Roosevelt Hotel, he orders a hefty meal, then exits the window and positions himself on a ledge.  People below notice him and soon the police are called in.  When a cop attempts to talk him in, Nick asks to speak with a different negotiator, Lydia Mercer (Elizabeth Banks).Mercer has been ostracized by her peers recently because she lost a previous jumper.  Her self-assurance has been tarnished, and she is perplexed as to why this potential suicide has requested her.  The cops dust for fingerprints to identify the would-be jumper, but the room is clean.  So Nick's identity remains unknown to them for quite some time.Ms. Banks never convinces us that she has risen to the rank of detective and been entrusted to such sensitive work as negotiator.  She has fashion model looks, and doesn't have the command the role requires.  A better casting choice would have been someone like Frances McDormand, Debra Monk, or Stockard Channing -- older women who could convey a harder edge than Ms. Banks.Much of the plot involves a scheme Nick has engineered, and we gradually see it unfold.  It is convoluted, depends on split-second timing, and is the kind of plan that could work only in a screenwriter's imagination.Worthington (""Avatar"") is adequate as the enigmatic man on the ledge, though he fails to bring any distinction to the role.  His Nick is determined to call the shots, and it soon becomes obvious that his threat to jump is masking a far more clandestine plan.The supporting cast is impressive.  Jamie Bell plays Nick's brother, Joey; Anthony Mackie is Nick's former co-worker; stone-faced Titus Welliver plays the cop in charge of the operation to get Nick off the ledge; and Edward Burns plays Det. Dougherty, the negotiator Lydia replaces.As a thriller, ""Man on a Ledge"" works reasonably well.  A large part of the movie involves an intricate caper that occurs as Nick teeters 25 floors above the street.  The mystery unfolds as the police, Nick's family, a wealthy businessman (Ed Harris), dirty cops, and Nick himself converge in the film's denouement.Rated PG-13, ""Man on a Ledge"" is not a bad movie, just a so-so one.  There's a sense that we've seen the film before and the screenwriter has cobbled together scenes from previous movies.  For a theatrical film, it has a decidedly TV-movie feel, although the crowd scenes and New York filming are impressive.  Asger Leth is a competent director, not an inspired one.  He has a good sense of pace and the movie never bogs down.",3,Perilous Plan to Clear One's Name,1333324800,"04 2, 2012",2012,2872,"['Man', 'Ledge', 'movie', 'man', 'jumping', 'death', 'Who', 'Why', 'chosen', 'method', 'suicide', 'why', 'so', 'insistent', 'dealing', 'particular', 'police', 'negotiator', 'Nick', 'Cassidy', 'Sam', 'Worthington', 'escaped', 'convicted', 'diamond', 'thief', 'elaborate', 'plan', 'clear', 'name', 'checking', 'upper-floor', 'room', 'Manhattan', 'Roosevelt', 'Hotel', 'orders', 'hefty', 'meal', 'then', 'window', 'positions', 'ledge', 'People', 'soon', 'police', 'are', 'called', 'When', 'cop', 'talk', 'Nick', 'speak', 'different', 'negotiator', 'Lydia', 'Mercer', 'Elizabeth', 'Banks', '.Mercer', 'been', 'ostracized', 'peers', 'recently', 'lost', 'previous', 'jumper', 'self-assurance', 'been', 'tarnished', 'perplexed', 'why', 'potential', 'suicide', 'requested', 'cops', 'dust', 'fingerprints', 'identify', 'would-be', 'jumper', 'room', 'clean', 'So', 'Nick', 'identity', 'unknown', 'quite', 'time.Ms', 'Banks', 'never', 'convinces', 'risen', 'rank', 'detective', 'been', 'entrusted', 'such', 'sensitive', 'work', 'negotiator', 'fashion', 'model', ""n't"", 'have', 'command', 'role', 'better', 'casting', 'choice', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'someone', 'Frances', 'McDormand', 'Debra', 'Monk', 'Stockard', 'Channing', 'older', 'women', 'who', 'could', 'convey', 'harder', 'edge', 'Ms.', 'Banks.Much', 'plot', 'scheme', 'Nick', 'engineered', 'gradually', 'see', 'unfold', 'convoluted', 'split-second', 'timing', 'kind', 'plan', 'could', 'work', 'only', 'screenwriter', 'imagination.Worthington', 'Avatar', 'adequate', 'enigmatic', 'man', 'ledge', 'bring', 'distinction', 'role', 'Nick', 'determined', 'call', 'shots', 'soon', 'obvious', 'threat', 'jump', 'masking', 'far', 'more', 'clandestine', 'plan.The', 'supporting', 'cast', 'impressive', 'Jamie', 'Bell', 'Nick', 'brother', 'Joey', 'Anthony', 'Mackie', 'Nick', 'former', 'co-worker', 'stone-faced', 'Titus', 'Welliver', 'cop', 'charge', 'operation', 'get', 'Nick', 'off', 'ledge', 'Edward', 'Burns', 'Det', 'Dougherty', 'negotiator', 'Lydia', 'thriller', 'Man', 'Ledge', 'reasonably', 'well', 'large', 'part', 'movie', 'intricate', 'caper', 'Nick', 'teeters', '25', 'floors', 'street', 'mystery', 'police', 'Nick', 'family', 'wealthy', 'businessman', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'dirty', 'cops', 'Nick', 'converge', 'film', 'denouement.Rated', 'PG-13', 'Man', 'Ledge', 'not', 'bad', 'movie', 'just', 'so-so', 'one', 'sense', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'film', 'screenwriter', 'cobbled', 'together', 'scenes', 'previous', 'movies', 'theatrical', 'film', 'decidedly', 'TV-movie', 'feel', 'crowd', 'scenes', 'New', 'York', 'filming', 'are', 'impressive', 'Asger', 'Leth', 'competent', 'director', 'not', 'inspired', 'one', 'good', 'sense', 'pace', 'movie', 'never', 'bogs', 'down']",N/A

Unfortunately, this film couldn't have been more ridiculous. Action movies are by nature unrealistic, but most of the time, at least some of the story is believable and makes sense. Man On A Ledge is a film that is all over the place, filled with scenes of unbelievable stupidity. The combination of corruption, theft, ridiculous moves, and lines that sound like their out of a comic book make this movie close to unwatchable. The man on the ledge has an agenda and asks for a beautiful negotiator to talk him down. Even she can see that he's stalling for time, but to what end? It leads to a totally unbelievable story with a horrible ending. I watched this film because I thought it would be different and I love both Elizabeth Banks and Jamie Bell. The cast was talented and the previews were good, but this movie is not. Man On A Ledge is just one of those movies that makes you question how stupid s*** like this even gets made in the first place.",2,The Ultimate Movie Review! -[...]- @tss5078,1361491200,"02 22, 2013",2013,1066,"['Anyone', 'who', 'ever', 'seen', 'movie', 'had', 'know', 'going', 'movie', 'was', 'about', 'more', 'just', 'man', 'ledge', 'Unfortunately', 'film', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'more', 'ridiculous', 'Action', 'movies', 'are', 'nature', 'unrealistic', 'most', 'time', 'least', 'story', 'believable', 'sense', 'Man', 'Ledge', 'film', 'place', 'filled', 'scenes', 'unbelievable', 'stupidity', 'combination', 'corruption', 'theft', 'ridiculous', 'moves', 'lines', 'sound', 'out', 'comic', 'book', 'make', 'movie', 'close', 'unwatchable', 'man', 'ledge', 'agenda', 'beautiful', 'negotiator', 'talk', 'down', 'Even', 'can', 'see', 'stalling', 'time', 'what', 'end', 'totally', 'unbelievable', 'story', 'horrible', 'ending', 'watched', 'film', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'different', 'love', 'Elizabeth', 'Banks', 'Jamie', 'Bell', 'cast', 'was', 'talented', 'previews', 'were', 'good', 'movie', 'not', 'Man', 'Ledge', 'just', 'one', 'movies', 'question', 'how', 'stupid', 's***', 'even', 'made', 'first', 'place']",N/A
1530214,A1XT8AJB7S9JJG,B007EQR0D8,Tony Heck,"[30, 33]","""Today's the day that everything changes, one way or another."" After Nick Cassidy (Worthington), a convict doing 25 years for theft, escapes from custody he ends up in a hotel. After his planning is complete he climbs out on a ledge in order to prove his innocence. This is an exciting movie that is very tense almost from the beginning and doesn't let up till the end. Not only are you on the edge of your seat wondering what Nick will do, but there is also a diamond heist going on at the same time that keeps you holding your breath. For this type of movie the cast isn't really all that amazing, but this is an exception. The cast is super in this and that actually adds to the enjoyment and gives the movie a more serious feel. This is a movie that keeps you guessing all the way through and is full of excitement. There were a few over-the-top scenes that made me laugh, but the movie was good enough to overcome those parts. I highly recommend this one. A really fun ""popcorn"" movie. Overall, very entertaining and fun to watch. I liked it. I give it a B+.",4,"Very exciting, tense and entertaining.

1530215,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B007EQR0D8,Tsuyoshi,"[1, 2]","Not to spoil the film's rather convoluted storyline, let me just tell you that ""Man on a Ledge"" is a light-hearted action thriller. Sam Worthington (""Avatar"") is Nick Cassidy, a ""Man on a Ledge"" of Roosevelt Hotel, New York City, threatening to end his life. A former police detective and escaped convict, Nick insists that he will only talk to a police negotiator Lydia Mercer (Elizabeth Banks).In the opening flashback scene it is also shown that Nick, arrested for stealing a 40 million-dollar diamond, has a younger brother Joey (Jamie Bell). Genesis Rodriguez plays Angie, Joey's girlfriend; Anthony Mackie is Mike, a police officer who once worked with Nick; Ed Burns is a cynical police officer Jack; and Ed Harris is the hotel owner David Englander. Kyra Sedgwick and William Sadler also appear as a TV reporter and a valet respectively.Despite the decent production design of the hotel building, ""Man on a Ledge"" just fails to interest us, revealing its hand too early. The film lacks the tension of ""The Negotiator,"" in which Samuel L. Jackson's character looked really serious about what he is doing. ""Man on a Ledge"" also suffers from an unfocused narrative. For the most part the film's actions take place in more than one place, but none of them is really interesting, due to director Asger Leth's (his feature debut) ineffectively employed cross-cutting storytelling.""Man on a Ledge"" is a mildly entertaining but forgettable action thriller.",3,(2.5 STARS) Mildly Entertaining,1342915200,"07 22, 2012",2012,1456,"['Not', 'spoil', 'film', 'rather', 'convoluted', 'storyline', 'let', 'just', 'tell', 'Man', 'Ledge', 'light-hearted', 'action', 'thriller', 'Sam', 'Worthington', 'Avatar', 'Nick', 'Cassidy', 'Man', 'Ledge', 'Roosevelt', 'Hotel', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'threatening', 'end', 'life', 'former', 'police', 'detective', 'escaped', 'convict', 'Nick', 'will', 'only', 'talk', 'police', 'negotiator', 'Lydia', 'Mercer', 'Elizabeth', 'Banks', '.In', 'opening', 'flashback', 'scene', 'also', 'shown', 'Nick', 'arrested', 'stealing', '40', 'million-dollar', 'diamond', 'younger', 'brother', 'Joey', 'Jamie', 'Bell', 'Genesis', 'Rodriguez', 'Angie', 'Joey', 'girlfriend', 'Anthony', 'Mackie', 'Mike', 'police', 'officer', 'who', 'once', 'worked', 'Nick', 'Ed', 'Burns', 'cynical', 'police', 'officer', 'Jack', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'hotel', 'owner', 'David', 'Englander', 'Kyra', 'Sedgwick', 'William', 'Sadler', 'also', 'appear', 'TV', 'reporter', 'valet', 'respectively.Despite', 'decent', 'production', 'design', 'hotel', 'building', 'Man', 'Ledge', 'just', 'interest', 'revealing', 'hand', 'too', 'early', 'film', 'tension', 'Negotiator', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'character', 'looked', 'really', 'serious', 'what', 'doing', 'Man', 'Ledge', 'also', 'unfocused', 'narrative', 'most', 'part', 'film', 'actions', 'take', 'place', 'more', 'one', 'place', 'none', 'really', 'interesting', 'due', 'director', 'Asger', 'Leth', 'feature', 'debut', 'ineffectively', 'employed', 'cross-cutting', 'storytelling', 'Man', 'Ledge', 'mildly', 'entertaining', 'forgettable', 'action', 'thriller']",N/A
