Now we just need something with Viserion. Too bad that, at this point, I believe most GoT fans that wanted to buy the BD boxes already own them, so this one's appeal is mainly the Funko figures. Gotta find a better way to market these things, HBO.",5,Rhaegal is getting some love!,1374019200,"07 17, 2013",2013,384,"['putting', 'Drogon', 'front', 'center', 'scene', 'Dany', 'dragons', ""'m"", 'glad', 'see', 'one', 'getting', 'spotlight', 'too', 'Now', 'just', 'need', 'something', 'Viserion', 'Too', 'bad', 'point', 'believe', 'most', 'GoT', 'fans', 'wanted', 'buy', 'BD', 'boxes', 'already', 'own', 'so', 'one', 'appeal', 'mainly', 'Funko', 'figures', 'Got', 'ta', 'find', 'better', 'way', 'market', 'things', 'HBO']",N/A

I collect the Funko Pop characters in a number of other series. For some reason these just do not live up to the quality I have come to expect from Funko. It is almost like they made these &#34;exclusives&#34; from damaged ones they could not sell elsewhere. So, if you don't need the heads, I would recommend just buying the blu ray seperately. You do pay more for the Funko. No issues whatsoever with the discs.",4,Blu Ray was excellent,1393286400,"02 25, 2014",2014,517,"['However', 'funko', 'pop', 'vinyls', 'had', 'serious', 'issues', 'was', 'left', 'little', 'disappointed', 'quality', 'collect', 'Funko', 'Pop', 'characters', 'number', 'other', 'series', 'reason', 'just', 'do', 'not', 'live', 'up', 'quality', 'have', 'come', 'expect', 'Funko', 'almost', 'made', '34', 'exclusives', '34', 'damaged', 'ones', 'could', 'not', 'sell', 'elsewhere', 'So', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'heads', 'would', 'recommend', 'just', 'buying', 'blu', 'ray', 'seperately', 'do', 'pay', 'more', 'Funko', 'No', 'issues', 'whatsoever', 'discs']",N/A

1662514,AJ0LVMSVJ0CN1,B00DY9GRAQ,Joan Burton,"[1, 4]","My son wanted me to buy the GOT series.  We binged watched during the holidays.  It's a great show but the over the top gratuitous sex/nude scenes are getting ridiculous.  All the actors are great but Peter Dinklage steals the show.  The only reason I wanted to watch this series is because of Peter Dinklage.  They also need to hire more American actors.  American TV has no problem hiring British actors.  There are many American actors who can pull off the British accent.I have to say that I can't believe that people have compared this to Lord of the Rings.  GRR Martin doesn't come close to Tolkien. I am entertained by the series and I am looking forward to season 3 but sometimes I roll my eyes at what he's doing with the writing.  Sometimes I think he's trying too hard.  The thing that everyone loved about Breaking Bad is that every single scene had meaning and was well thought out and not gratuitous.  With GOT, I find myself asking what was the purpose of that scene or that scene should have been cut short or cut out altogether.  I never once felt that way with Breaking Bad and I can't wait to binge watch the series.When I purchased this set, I had no idea what these Funko Pop Vinyls were and hoped my son would like them.  He was very happy with the whole package especially those Funko Pop Vinyls.",4,Great show but...,1390262400,"01 21, 2014",2014,1319,"['son', 'wanted', 'buy', 'GOT', 'series', 'binged', 'watched', 'holidays', 'great', 'show', 'top', 'gratuitous', 'sex/nude', 'scenes', 'are', 'getting', 'ridiculous', 'actors', 'are', 'great', 'Peter', 'Dinklage', 'show', 'only', 'reason', 'wanted', 'watch', 'series', 'Peter', 'Dinklage', 'also', 'need', 'hire', 'more', 'American', 'actors', 'American', 'TV', 'problem', 'hiring', 'British', 'actors', 'are', 'many', 'American', 'actors', 'who', 'can', 'pull', 'off', 'British', 'accent.I', 'have', 'say', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'people', 'have', 'compared', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'GRR', 'Martin', ""n't"", 'come', 'close', 'Tolkien', 'am', 'entertained', 'series', 'am', 'looking', 'forward', 'season', '3', 'sometimes', 'roll', 'eyes', 'what', 'doing', 'writing', 'Sometimes', 'think', 'trying', 'too', 'hard', 'thing', 'everyone', 'loved', 'Breaking', 'Bad', 'single', 'scene', 'had', 'meaning', 'was', 'well', 'thought', 'out', 'not', 'gratuitous', 'GOT', 'find', 'asking', 'what', 'was', 'purpose', 'scene', 'scene', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'cut', 'short', 'cut', 'out', 'altogether', 'never', 'once', 'felt', 'way', 'Breaking', 'Bad', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'binge', 'watch', 'series.When', 'purchased', 'set', 'had', 'idea', 'what', 'Funko', 'Pop', 'Vinyls', 'were', 'hoped', 'son', 'would', 'like', 'was', 'very', 'happy', 'whole', 'package', 'especially', 'Funko', 'Pop', 'Vinyls']",N/A
