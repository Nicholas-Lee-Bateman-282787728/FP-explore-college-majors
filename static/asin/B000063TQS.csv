Despite the fact that this show began 6 years ago, it's still as fresh, smart, and hilariously funny now as it was then. In fact, it's only gotten better. Without a doubt, Sarah Jessica's natural charm is the show's greatest asset. But, Kristin Davis (Charlotte), Cynthia Nixon (Miranda), and the incomparable Kim Catrall (Samantha) each bring something unique and special to every single episode. They're all very different from eachother, but the chemistry is unbelievable. It just works! As the seasons have progressed, each character is becoming emotionally deeper (even Samantha!). It's not just about sex. With each episode, we see more and more true colors shining through with all 4 girls. That's what keeps the show fresh and interesting.

The writing is sharp and intelligent as well as thought provoking, while the story lines are titillating and downright sexy. They have created the perfect package and by the multiple awards that the show and its artists have won, it is apparent that the powers that be are watching, and they like what they see.After watching all three seasons, I have to say that each season is getting better. The storylines are more interesting with guest appearances that include a trip to the playboy mansion to meet Hugh Hefner, and a chat with Sarah Michelle Gellar on a trip to LA. The writing is cutting edge, and the relationship dilemmas come across as real. The sex is fun for the armchair voyeur who dreams that his or her life could be so exciting.

All the characters come from the same drag queen with multiple personality disorder (Samantha in particular, though delicious, is all fantasy), and Carrie as a character is SO jewish, in terms of her bookishness and always processing everyone ELSE's opinions, it is odd that they claim she came from ""somewhere upstate"", never mentions a mother and finally, had a father that abandoned her at a young age and is no particular religion.  Very thrown-together.  Doesn't make sense, never has.But my real beef is the packaging.  At first I thought the plastic cover style (which has remained consistent through the seasons)was cool.  Until I cut my hand open on it.  Then on eBay I noticed many people selling the DVDs used mention the cover had come off (so either they got cut, too or the packaging wasn't designed for longevity).I'd love LOTS more info on behind the scenes, outtakes, and they really skimped all of that away.

So was getting the Third season to add to my First and Second collections.Being a native of New York City, and having worked, dated, and socialized in the one of a kind, glorious, non-stop party that IS life for those lucky enough to live it here, I can honestly say that ""Sex.."" captures the mood, spririt, and attitude of all the attractive, successful and confident New York women, and those like them elsewhere.  While you watch, you really feel like you know Carrie, Samantha, Charlotte and Miranda.  You are at once, sympathetic to their plight, and happy when they're happy.  The characters remain as distinct in season three, as they have been through the past two seasons.  However. in season three, I think they even go deeper into what really makes each character so fascinating.There are some very ""BIG"" plots this time around, as Carrie's on again/off again. Mr. Big, (Chris Noth) goes way off and marries the much younger Natasha.  I was as angry about this as Carrie!  Of course, after he's committed, he wants Carrie more than ever.  She simultaneously tries to juggle two men after meeting a very significant other, a sculptor named Aidan.  Despite his complete difference from Big, and his solemn aversion to smoking, Carrie gets herself involved.  This becomes the perfect fodder for Big's jealousy after a chance meeting with Carrie and Aidan at a furniture show he's attending with his WIFE.Meanwhile, Charlotte meets Trey (Kyle McLachlan) a doctor who seems to be Mr. Right.  A whirlwind romance leads to a proposal when Charlotte pops the suggestion and Trey says ""Allrightie"" much to her chagrin.  Her steadfast resolve in saving ""it"" for the wedding, may lead to her overlooking a very important piece of the marriage puzzle.As Miranda takes up living with the irritating, but simple and sweet Steve, and Samantha is, well, still Samantha, the four friends have more fun than ever.  The season culminates in a foray to the west coast, where well known faces like Vince Vaughn, Hugh Hefner and Sarah Michelle Gellar pop in, are glitzy glamorous fun.

695910,A34CVPZ30BA4GD,B000063TQS,James Robert Dator,"[0, 1]","The first and second seasons of the HBO hit 'Sex and the city' experienced great success on the DVD market and this is attributed to a number of reasons.It is fabulous to see a show that deals with the taboo, the untalked about world of sex and how this world is personified by a number of lovable protagonists. Yes, in order to completely enjoy the show a certain degree of belief must be suspended. I mean these girls have sex every night, talk about it all day and Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker) is able to afford an enormous shoe library despite the fact she is a writer; It is here though that the show creates a lot of it's charm. 'Sex and the city' deals with the extensions of the world of sex. The rude, shocking, embarrassing and often things that are left behind closed doors. And the audience is allowed to laugh at it... why? BECAUSE IT'S NOT US! Thank god we needn't worry about the things Carrie and the gang has to, if it were not in fact fictitious the show would seem quite odd!The third season was the exemplification of the issues brought to the forefront in the first 2 seasons. It can be seen that more risks were taken in the 3rd series. Each and every year 'Sex and the city' pushes the boundaries of what is socially acceptable, or allowed to be talked about. There are also some fantastic guest star roles in the 3rd season that include Sarah Michelle Geller and Vince Vaughan to name a few.The DVD transfer of the first two seasons was faultless. It's great to see a show you love unedited, without ad breaks and no waiting 'til next week. The features included are also fabulous. So buy the third season, sit back, relax and enjoy the wildness and political incorrectness that the wonderfully crafted 'Sex and the city' bring to the forefront.",4,Great series of a great show.,1016409600,"03 18, 2002",2002,1770,"['first', 'second', 'seasons', 'HBO', 'hit', ""'Sex"", 'city', 'experienced', 'great', 'success', 'DVD', 'market', 'attributed', 'number', 'reasons.It', 'fabulous', 'see', 'show', 'deals', 'taboo', 'untalked', 'world', 'sex', 'how', 'world', 'personified', 'number', 'lovable', 'protagonists', 'Yes', 'order', 'completely', 'enjoy', 'show', 'certain', 'degree', 'belief', 'must', 'be', 'suspended', 'mean', 'girls', 'have', 'sex', 'night', 'talk', 'day', 'Carrie', 'Sarah', 'Jessica', 'Parker', 'able', 'afford', 'enormous', 'shoe', 'library', 'fact', 'writer', 'here', 'show', 'lot', 'charm', ""'Sex"", 'city', 'deals', 'extensions', 'world', 'sex', 'rude', 'shocking', 'embarrassing', 'often', 'things', 'are', 'left', 'closed', 'doors', 'audience', 'allowed', 'laugh', 'why', 'IT', 'NOT', 'US', 'Thank', 'god', 'need', ""n't"", 'worry', 'things', 'Carrie', 'gang', 'were', 'not', 'fact', 'fictitious', 'show', 'would', 'seem', 'quite', 'odd', 'third', 'season', 'was', 'exemplification', 'issues', 'brought', 'forefront', 'first', '2', 'seasons', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'more', 'risks', 'were', 'taken', '3rd', 'series', 'year', 'city', 'pushes', 'boundaries', 'what', 'socially', 'acceptable', 'allowed', 'be', 'talked', 'are', 'also', 'fantastic', 'guest', 'star', 'roles', '3rd', 'season', 'include', 'Sarah', 'Michelle', 'Geller', 'Vince', 'Vaughan', 'name', 'few.The', 'DVD', 'transfer', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'was', 'faultless', 'great', 'see', 'show', 'love', 'unedited', 'ad', 'breaks', 'waiting', 'next', 'week', 'features', 'included', 'are', 'also', 'fabulous', 'So', 'buy', 'third', 'season', 'sit', 'back', 'relax', 'enjoy', 'wildness', 'political', 'incorrectness', 'wonderfully', 'crafted', ""'Sex"", 'city', 'bring', 'forefront']",Sex and the City: Season 3

I enjoyed that added attention to the inner life of the core cast.  I also enjoyed- mild, broad spoiler here- how the season closed on a subtle grace note, with each of the girls facing a new, uncertain road before them, a road fraught with a little scariness (as they all seem to think to themselves, ""what's in store for me?"") but also laced with a little hope.",4,"The girls get some action, but also a little wisdom",1217894400,"08 5, 2008",2008,879,"['Containing', 'eighteen', 'solid', 'episodes', 'laughs', 'bawdy', 'doings', 'occasional', 'seriousness', 'Sex', 'City', 'Complete', 'Third', 'Season', 'whip-smart', 'fun', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'enriching', 'pot', 'additional', 'flavors', 'nuances', 'do', 'follow', 'progress', 'Charlotte', 'new', 'marriage', 'season', 'slightly', 'more', 'tilted', 'girls', 'themselves-', 'feelings', 'discoveries', 'importance', 'mutual', 'friendship-', 'who', ""'re"", 'seeing', 'romantically', 'enjoyed', 'added', 'attention', 'inner', 'life', 'core', 'cast', 'also', 'enjoyed-', 'mild', 'broad', 'spoiler', 'here-', 'how', 'season', 'closed', 'subtle', 'grace', 'note', 'girls', 'facing', 'new', 'uncertain', 'road', 'road', 'fraught', 'little', 'scariness', 'seem', 'think', 'what', 'store', 'also', 'laced', 'little', 'hope']",Sex and the City: Season 3

And maybe that's the point--these are men and women you laugh at, not with.  That the humor of this show is derisive and cynical, showing how superficial many lives really are--and how empty and materialistic our culture has become.  If that's the point, I get it.  If that isn't the point (as many of the positive reviewers suggest), then be afraid.  Be very afraid.  If this is ""real life"" for many people, then things are far worse than I ever imagined.The main characters do a good job of mimicking the most shallow, self-absorbed, vain, and misdirected women I know.  They are obsessed with sex talk and sex, have perilously low self-esteem, have little or no intellectual depth, and, in the end, are leading absolutely meaningless lives.  Do they discuss significant ideas?  No.  Do they care more about clothing and money than emotional depth?  Yes.  They make the empty-headed ""Friends"" seem complex in comparison.  At least they can manage childish relationships with equally empty-headed men blended together with low-brow stupidity.I know this isn't meant to be Shakespeare, but there is only so much of it that you can watch.  There is enough of this ""humor"" in real life.  (It is quite sad, really, to see the number of female reviewers who claim that this show comes close to describing their ""urban"" lives.)They should have a reunion show when these women are in their early sixties.  Health problems beginning to mount.  Age taking its toll.  A few lost jobs.  No real relationships in sight.  Angst, alienation, and anomie setting in? (Forget it.  These folks wouldn't get it if it hit them over the head with a two-by-four.)  Endless plastic surgery.  Money running out.  Now, might that be worth a chuckle?  No, not really.In a culture where the highest rated television shows are Friends and Survivor, the popularity of this show is hardly surprising.

I now watch it regularly on HBO, never, ever miss it.This show is not about sex so much as it's about a group of four friends and their journeys through love, loss, and questioning what's really important.  The main character, Carrie (played so well by Sarah Jessica Parker), writes a newspaper column where she muses on the meanings of relationships and love.  The story revolves around her friendships with the other three characters: Samantha -- a very loose woman who deep down longs for a lasting relationship but goes through lots of sexual escapades; Charlotte -- an uptight, but sweet upper-crust rich girl who loves and loses terribly; and Miranda -- a type A lawyer who can't seem to reconcile sharing her life and her personal space even if she's in love.  The characters are very well developed and the actors portray them so well that you completely believe they are who they play.The greatest pleasure of all is that this show is available on DVD.

695927,A2000DWMMYNIYB,B000063TQS,Peter Lorenzi,"[3, 5]","You don't have to worship restaurants, martinis, or expensive shoes to enjoy the addictive indulgence called ""Sex and the City"". It is a pleasant, if amoral diversion. There are no real lessons to be learned, just a few smiles and glimpses of the high life in New York City. In this third season, our heroine, sex columnist Carrie Bradshaw, finds and loses and new boy friend, rediscovers and loses an old boyfriend, and another friend finds, loses, rediscovers and once more loses a husband. Along the way, ""Sex"" offers us dream-like visions of New York as the singles capital of the world. In one episode, Bradshaw teaches a class on the subject. She does a poor job; perhaps she hasn't really learned her own lessons.Setting aside the fact that time, money and work seem to be irrelevant to these four women, this Seinfeld-like quartet offers four versions of the consummate thirty-something (and perhaps then some) single Manhattan female. The weather is unerringly beautiful. Money flows out faster than the alcohol pours in. Men slip through their fingers faster than the feisty foursome can find them. Carrie is oh-so-petite, easy on the eye (despite the unruly mess of roots and tones that constitute her hair color) and hard on the heart and the wallet.  She is indecisive and inconsistent. Her brief `philosophical' reflections that center her column and the title of each episode disguise a life otherwise void of reflection. Samantha, the public relations executive, is sexually obsessed and without qualms and, apparently, traditional morals. Meeting an equally active thirteen-year-old girl only sets her back for a brief moment. Sam feels merely old, not chastened. `Safe sex' and any STD seem to have eluded her as she cuts a very wide sexual swath through the city. Miranda, now a partner in her law firm, has her own outlandish red hair and a cloying bartender boy friend who allows her to manifest her own multiple insecurities, be they in her career or in her brief encounter with orthodontic braces. She is the `serious' one of the group, the professional woman climbing the corporate ladder at great social expense. And Charlotte, the classically beautiful and `innocent' member of the foursome, is intent on following some self-imposed social-climbing order. She succeeds and quickly fails in each step. She may not have the stamina to keep up with the other three, only the nerve to try.This series is certainly not for the prudish. The language is blunt, direct, and colorful, with some funny, crude lines. This is bathroom - or locker room -- talk around the coffee shop table. The Legion of Decency would ban it outright. There is no real morally redeeming value. The language is unencumbered but more colorful than crude. The sexual nudity is common (mostly Samantha) but usually `tasteful', that is, not graphically pornographic. These four women are less role models than they are caricatures that provide comic relief and fantasies for people who think that New York singles' life is easy and glamorous. For those who think the single, rich life in Manhattan is an idyllic existence; this show is the storyboard for that life. Enjoy the scenery, look a little harder beneath the surface, tune out the language and nudity, and you find a pretty harsh, unappealing existence, and perhaps some useful life lessons.",4,Guilty pleasure,1057536000,"07 7, 2003",2003,3342,"['do', ""n't"", 'have', 'worship', 'restaurants', 'martinis', 'expensive', 'shoes', 'enjoy', 'addictive', 'indulgence', 'called', 'Sex', 'City', 'pleasant', 'amoral', 'diversion', 'are', 'real', 'lessons', 'be', 'learned', 'just', 'few', 'smiles', 'glimpses', 'high', 'life', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'third', 'season', 'heroine', 'sex', 'columnist', 'Carrie', 'Bradshaw', 'new', 'boy', 'friend', 'rediscovers', 'old', 'boyfriend', 'friend', 'rediscovers', 'once', 'more', 'husband', 'way', 'Sex', 'dream-like', 'visions', 'New', 'York', 'singles', 'capital', 'world', 'one', 'episode', 'Bradshaw', 'class', 'subject', 'poor', 'job', 'perhaps', ""n't"", 'really', 'learned', 'own', 'lessons.Setting', 'fact', 'time', 'money', 'work', 'seem', 'be', 'irrelevant', 'four', 'women', 'Seinfeld-like', 'quartet', 'four', 'versions', 'consummate', 'thirty-something', 'perhaps', 'then', 'single', 'Manhattan', 'female', 'weather', 'unerringly', 'beautiful', 'Money', 'out', 'faster', 'alcohol', 'pours', 'Men', 'slip', 'fingers', 'faster', 'feisty', 'foursome', 'can', 'find', 'Carrie', 'oh-so-petite', 'easy', 'eye', 'unruly', 'mess', 'roots', 'tones', 'constitute', 'hair', 'color', 'hard', 'heart', 'wallet', 'indecisive', 'inconsistent', 'brief', 'philosophical', 'reflections', 'center', 'column', 'title', 'episode', 'disguise', 'life', 'otherwise', 'void', 'reflection', 'Samantha', 'public', 'relations', 'executive', 'sexually', 'obsessed', 'qualms', 'apparently', 'traditional', 'morals', 'Meeting', 'equally', 'active', 'thirteen-year-old', 'girl', 'only', 'back', 'brief', 'moment', 'Sam', 'merely', 'old', 'not', 'chastened', 'Safe', 'sex', 'STD', 'seem', 'have', 'eluded', 'very', 'wide', 'sexual', 'swath', 'city', 'Miranda', 'now', 'partner', 'law', 'firm', 'own', 'outlandish', 'red', 'hair', 'cloying', 'bartender', 'boy', 'friend', 'who', 'manifest', 'own', 'multiple', 'insecurities', 'be', 'career', 'brief', 'encounter', 'orthodontic', 'braces', 'serious', 'one', 'group', 'professional', 'woman', 'climbing', 'corporate', 'ladder', 'great', 'social', 'expense', 'Charlotte', 'classically', 'beautiful', 'innocent', 'member', 'foursome', 'intent', 'following', 'self-imposed', 'social-climbing', 'order', 'quickly', 'fails', 'step', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'stamina', 'keep', 'up', 'other', 'three', 'only', 'nerve', 'try.This', 'series', 'certainly', 'not', 'prudish', 'language', 'blunt', 'direct', 'colorful', 'funny', 'crude', 'lines', 'bathroom', 'locker', 'room', 'talk', 'coffee', 'shop', 'table', 'Legion', 'Decency', 'would', 'ban', 'outright', 'real', 'morally', 'redeeming', 'value', 'language', 'unencumbered', 'more', 'colorful', 'crude', 'sexual', 'nudity', 'common', 'mostly', 'Samantha', 'usually', 'tasteful', 'not', 'graphically', 'pornographic', 'four', 'women', 'are', 'less', 'role', 'models', 'are', 'caricatures', 'provide', 'comic', 'relief', 'fantasies', 'people', 'who', 'think', 'New', 'York', 'singles', 'life', 'easy', 'glamorous', 'who', 'think', 'single', 'rich', 'life', 'Manhattan', 'idyllic', 'existence', 'show', 'storyboard', 'life', 'Enjoy', 'scenery', 'look', 'little', 'harder', 'surface', 'out', 'language', 'nudity', 'find', 'pretty', 'harsh', 'unappealing', 'existence', 'perhaps', 'useful', 'life', 'lessons']",Sex and the City: Season 3

The stories were always told with intelligence and wit, with drama being an important element, but with laughter thrown in; anyone who has ever lived life knows you can't get by every day without problems and humor and this series' creators knew this from the get go. This why ""Sex and the City"" struck a cord with the American public.This set contains all 18 episodes from season 3 that aired originally on HBO during the summer of 2000. During this season Carrie continues to struggle in her somewhat strange relationship with Mr. Big while meeting a hunky stud named Aidan. Unfortunately, Carrie has an affair with Big which could blow up in her face. Miranda is still with Steve, but then discovers she has a sexually transmitted disease from a former partner. Samantha, being Samantha, dates a man who won't go any further with her until she is tested for HIV; the scene with Samantha in the doctor's office is hilarious. Finally. Charlotte meets Trey, a handsome New Yorker who's still living under his rich, snobbish mother's thumb, socialite Bunny.Overall, a great season filled with innovative stories with the underlying theme that your life is only fulfilled if you have great fashion, great sex, and great friends.

695937,AV5G37VFE5NVD,B000063TQS,Tom Benton,"[2, 4]","*Possible spoilers within.*Though it had grown progressively better through its first two seasons, the third season of ""Sex and the City"" was by far the best yet.  That's because the show stopped depending so much on placing the characters in outrageous situations and began also paying attention to the characters themselves, creating numerous story arcs as well.  By the end of the third season, each of the characters had developed, but realistically so.Season Three, comprised of 18 episodes airing from June to October 2000, thrust the girls into the new millennium.  Still recooperating from her second breakup with Mr. Big (Chris Noth), Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker) reluctantly returns to dating, first with a charming politician (John Slattery) before falling into her first serious relationship since Big with an irresistible all-American furniture designer named Aidan (John Corbett).  But then, just as things are going perfectly, none other than Mr. Big himself reappears in Carrie's life, leading to a chain of events that will hurt more than just our favorite sex columnist.The supporting characters get their share of storylines as well.  Miranda (Cynthia Nixon) finally finds a serious relationship when she meets Steve (David Eigenberg), an adorable and sweet bartender.  Their relationship is always on the edge, however, thanks to Miranda's tendency to self-destruct when things start going well.  Samantha (Kim Cattrall) gains a little morality and self-control (but just a little) while she deals with the fact that she's getting older.  Then there's Charlotte (Kristin Davis), who decides that this is the year she's going to get married.  It turns out she's right.  So who's the lucky man?  None other than the peerless Kyle MacLachlan (of ""Blue Velvet"" and ""Twin Peaks"" fame, among much else).  But Charlotte is shocked to find herself loosening up when she realizes marriage isn't all she'd thought it would be.The work of the series' writers really made this season the show's finest yet.  The girls' antics had been enough to support the show through the past seasons, but they would only support them for so long.  The writers realized this, and they developed enough story arcs and difficulties to re-shape the characters and keep viewers on the edge of their seat.  Not to worry, though: Carrie kept on answering those questions that continue to haunt women around the world.  And while the season's multiple storylines keeps the season feeling fresh from start to finish, the writers went above and beyond when they moved Carrie and the gang to L.A. for a couple of episodes.  It was a refreshing change from the increasingly dreary streets of New York, and included wonderful guest appearances from Vince Vaughn, Hugh Hefner, Carrie Fisher, Sarah Michelle Gellar, and Matthew McConaughey.Season Three was the show's best season yet, thanks to excellent work on the writers' parts and a fabulous guest cast.  As the season finale came to its close, Carrie was reunited with Big yet again.  This time, however, their meeting ended with smiles and hope rather than tears and disappointment, leaving the millions of ""Sex and the City"" addicts feeling anxious and optimistic about what promised to be a superb fourth season.",5,"Character development, multiple story arcs, and four fabulous women",1177632000,"04 27, 2007",2007,3252,"['*Possible', 'spoilers', 'had', 'grown', 'progressively', 'better', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'third', 'season', 'Sex', 'City', 'was', 'far', 'best', 'yet', 'show', 'stopped', 'depending', 'so', 'much', 'placing', 'characters', 'outrageous', 'situations', 'began', 'also', 'paying', 'attention', 'characters', 'creating', 'numerous', 'story', 'arcs', 'well', 'end', 'third', 'season', 'characters', 'had', 'developed', 'realistically', 'so.Season', 'Three', 'comprised', '18', 'episodes', 'airing', 'June', 'October', '2000', 'thrust', 'girls', 'new', 'millennium', 'Still', 'recooperating', 'second', 'breakup', 'Mr.', 'Big', 'Chris', 'Noth', 'Carrie', 'Sarah', 'Jessica', 'Parker', 'reluctantly', 'dating', 'first', 'charming', 'politician', 'John', 'Slattery', 'falling', 'first', 'serious', 'relationship', 'Big', 'irresistible', 'all-American', 'furniture', 'designer', 'named', 'Aidan', 'John', 'Corbett', 'then', 'just', 'things', 'are', 'going', 'perfectly', 'none', 'other', 'Mr.', 'Big', 'Carrie', 'life', 'leading', 'chain', 'events', 'will', 'hurt', 'more', 'just', 'favorite', 'sex', 'columnist.The', 'supporting', 'characters', 'get', 'share', 'storylines', 'well', 'Miranda', 'Cynthia', 'Nixon', 'finally', 'serious', 'relationship', 'when', 'Steve', 'David', 'Eigenberg', 'adorable', 'sweet', 'bartender', 'relationship', 'always', 'edge', 'however', 'thanks', 'Miranda', 'tendency', 'self-destruct', 'when', 'things', 'start', 'going', 'well', 'Samantha', 'Kim', 'Cattrall', 'gains', 'little', 'morality', 'self-control', 'just', 'little', 'fact', 'getting', 'older', 'Then', 'Charlotte', 'Kristin', 'Davis', 'who', 'year', 'going', 'get', 'married', 'out', 'right', 'So', 'who', 'lucky', 'man', 'None', 'other', 'peerless', 'Kyle', 'MacLachlan', 'Blue', 'Velvet', 'Twin', 'Peaks', 'fame', 'much', 'else', 'Charlotte', 'shocked', 'find', 'loosening', 'up', 'when', 'marriage', ""n't"", ""'d"", 'thought', 'would', 'be.The', 'work', 'series', 'writers', 'really', 'made', 'season', 'show', 'finest', 'yet', 'girls', 'antics', 'had', 'been', 'enough', 'support', 'show', 'past', 'seasons', 'would', 'only', 'support', 'so', 'long', 'writers', 'realized', 'developed', 'enough', 'story', 'arcs', 'difficulties', 're-shape', 'characters', 'keep', 'viewers', 'edge', 'seat', 'Not', 'worry', 'Carrie', 'kept', 'answering', 'questions', 'continue', 'haunt', 'women', 'world', 'season', 'multiple', 'storylines', 'season', 'feeling', 'fresh', 'start', 'finish', 'writers', 'went', 'when', 'moved', 'Carrie', 'gang', 'L.A.', 'couple', 'episodes', 'was', 'refreshing', 'change', 'increasingly', 'dreary', 'streets', 'New', 'York', 'included', 'wonderful', 'guest', 'appearances', 'Vince', 'Vaughn', 'Hugh', 'Hefner', 'Carrie', 'Fisher', 'Sarah', 'Michelle', 'Gellar', 'Matthew', 'McConaughey.Season', 'Three', 'was', 'show', 'best', 'season', 'yet', 'thanks', 'excellent', 'work', 'writers', 'parts', 'fabulous', 'guest', 'cast', 'season', 'finale', 'came', 'close', 'Carrie', 'was', 'reunited', 'Big', 'yet', 'again', 'time', 'however', 'meeting', 'ended', 'smiles', 'hope', 'rather', 'tears', 'disappointment', 'leaving', 'millions', 'Sex', 'City', 'feeling', 'anxious', 'optimistic', 'what', 'promised', 'be', 'superb', 'fourth', 'season']",Sex and the City: Season 3
695938,A2USTECHX1PKVA,B000063TQS,"Weedwacker ""I'm a doctor of STEW.""","[0, 0]","I am not going to comment on the series (although from me it gets three stars for various reasons) but I felt compelled to review the actual quality of the packaging and DVD setup because they are severely lacking.These sets look attractive, but the packaging is very flimsy.  These are plastic cases that do not actually close, rather they just &#34;fold&#34; over, which is odd and they fall apart after moderate use because you basically have to lightly pry them open and physically hold them open in order to remove the disc--well that only lasts so long before the plastic simply snaps apart unless you only take the discs out a few times ever.There is no content information on the packaging.  Yes, we know which season we are watching because it is noted on the cover, but there are no episodes listed, no indication which episodes are on which disc beyond &#34;Episodes 1-6.&#34;  So, unless you truly have these memorized then plan on having to refer to the internet to figure out where the episodes fall, or, be prepared to put the disc in, wait for it to load and then for the menu to come up in order to find out what's on that disc.  This is no big deal if you're just watching the series in order once but if you are already familiar with the series and like certain episodes more than others or prefer certain time frames of the show then it's nice to be able to look at the DVD case to see which episodes are included on that particular disc.The worst offense of these sets--in my opinion--is that there is NO &#34;play all&#34; feature.  I personally find this to be ridiculous, especially when we are dealing with a series that has such very short episodes.  And not only that but you have to hit &#34;play&#34; at least twice before the episode plays because they offer to play with commentary or without commentary and you have to actually select &#34;episodes&#34; from the main menu to get to that screen.  So, you have to go through all of that to play one episode and in the meantime the menus themselves are annoying as all hell, filled with non-stop background theme music and random bits of dialogue from the show which will play for all eternity if you let it.I never thought I would be complaining about things that sound so silly, but after purchasing three seasons of the show and dealing with the general nuisance of the overly elaborate menus and functions of the DVDs I had to say it!I would probably skip these and go for the newer sets if they are available.  Maybe some of these super annoying issues have been resolved?",2,"Review of the PRODUCT, not the series itself...",1394323200,"03 9, 2014",2014,2557,"['am', 'not', 'going', 'comment', 'series', 'three', 'stars', 'various', 'reasons', 'felt', 'compelled', 'review', 'actual', 'quality', 'packaging', 'DVD', 'setup', 'are', 'severely', 'lacking.These', 'sets', 'look', 'attractive', 'packaging', 'very', 'flimsy', 'are', 'plastic', 'cases', 'do', 'not', 'actually', 'close', 'rather', 'just', '34', 'fold', '34', 'odd', 'fall', 'apart', 'moderate', 'use', 'basically', 'have', 'lightly', 'pry', 'open', 'physically', 'hold', 'open', 'order', 'remove', 'disc', 'well', 'only', 'so', 'long', 'plastic', 'simply', 'snaps', 'apart', 'only', 'take', 'discs', 'out', 'few', 'times', 'ever.There', 'content', 'information', 'packaging', 'Yes', 'know', 'season', 'are', 'watching', 'noted', 'cover', 'are', 'episodes', 'listed', 'indication', 'episodes', 'are', 'disc', '34', 'Episodes', '1-6.', '34', 'So', 'truly', 'have', 'memorized', 'then', 'plan', 'having', 'refer', 'internet', 'figure', 'out', 'where', 'episodes', 'fall', 'be', 'prepared', 'put', 'disc', 'wait', 'load', 'then', 'menu', 'come', 'up', 'order', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'disc', 'big', 'deal', ""'re"", 'just', 'watching', 'series', 'order', 'once', 'are', 'already', 'familiar', 'series', 'certain', 'episodes', 'more', 'others', 'prefer', 'certain', 'time', 'frames', 'show', 'then', 'nice', 'be', 'able', 'look', 'DVD', 'case', 'see', 'episodes', 'are', 'included', 'particular', 'disc.The', 'worst', 'offense', 'sets', 'opinion', 'NO', '34', 'play', '34', 'feature', 'personally', 'find', 'be', 'ridiculous', 'especially', 'when', 'are', 'dealing', 'series', 'such', 'very', 'short', 'episodes', 'not', 'only', 'have', 'hit', '34', 'play', '34', 'least', 'twice', 'episode', 'plays', 'offer', 'play', 'commentary', 'commentary', 'have', 'actually', 'select', '34', 'episodes', '34', 'main', 'menu', 'get', 'screen', 'So', 'have', 'go', 'play', 'one', 'episode', 'meantime', 'menus', 'are', 'annoying', 'hell', 'filled', 'non-stop', 'background', 'theme', 'music', 'random', 'bits', 'dialogue', 'show', 'will', 'play', 'eternity', 'let', 'it.I', 'never', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'complaining', 'things', 'sound', 'so', 'silly', 'purchasing', 'three', 'seasons', 'show', 'dealing', 'general', 'nuisance', 'overly', 'elaborate', 'menus', 'functions', 'DVDs', 'had', 'say', 'would', 'probably', 'skip', 'go', 'newer', 'sets', 'are', 'available', 'Maybe', 'super', 'annoying', 'issues', 'have', 'been', 'resolved']",Sex and the City: Season 3
