Even though it has a star-studded cast of rappers and singers, they concentrate on the story.Knowles plays Carmen, an ambitious but tragically fated woman who intoxicated Mekhi Phifer's character. He plays the policeman who falls head over heels in love with her that he leaves his betrothed for her, goes to jail and runs away from the feds all for her. Mos Def plays the superior police man who wants to catch Phifer and he plays the disgusting, slimy police man perfectly. He gets special points here proving that he can act. Watch out for him in Monster Ball; he makes a small cameo.Positive points: Knowles plays the sultry sex siren perfectly. Her undeniable beauty and acting skills create 'the black Carmen'. The music in this adaptation was great; Da Brat's opening and closing rap was fantastic.Negative points: Jermaine Dupri needs to get over himself and stop appearing in films!",4,Knowles proves herself,1059955200,"08 4, 2003",2003,1045,"['When', 'first', 'heard', 'Carmen', 'Hip', 'Hopera', 'thought', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'video', 'rappers', 'indulging', 'themselves.However', 'was', 'proved', 'wrong', 'Even', 'star-studded', 'cast', 'rappers', 'singers', 'concentrate', 'story.Knowles', 'Carmen', 'ambitious', 'tragically', 'fated', 'woman', 'who', 'intoxicated', 'Mekhi', 'Phifer', 'character', 'policeman', 'who', 'head', 'heels', 'love', 'betrothed', 'jail', 'runs', 'away', 'feds', 'Mos', 'Def', 'superior', 'police', 'man', 'who', 'catch', 'Phifer', 'disgusting', 'slimy', 'police', 'man', 'perfectly', 'special', 'points', 'here', 'proving', 'can', 'act', 'Watch', 'out', 'Monster', 'Ball', 'small', 'cameo.Positive', 'points', 'Knowles', 'sultry', 'sex', 'perfectly', 'undeniable', 'beauty', 'acting', 'skills', 'create', ""'the"", 'black', 'Carmen', 'music', 'adaptation', 'was', 'great', 'Da', 'Brat', 'opening', 'closing', 'rap', 'was', 'fantastic.Negative', 'points', 'Jermaine', 'Dupri', 'get', 'stop', 'appearing', 'films']",Carmen: A Hip Hopera (DVD)

MTV does a good job in interpreting Bizet's finest masterpiece to modern-day realities, this time in inner-city Philadelphia where a virtuous police officer met Carmen at a well-populated watering hole. After arresting Carmen during a catfight, he gradually lost all self-control by spending a night at her apartment that resulted in his demotion and loss of his fiance.  Things went downhill afterwards.

Hill is engaged to the perfect woman (not Beyonce, another girl)... until one night when he has to drive Carmen to the police station and thats when the drama begins. Carmen will do anything to get out of going to jail. Even seducing him. And thats where everything starts to go wrong..Its not anything spectacular, but its good to watch once or twice. The songs in it are pretty good.. especially ""If looks could kill"" which Beyonce & Mos Def sang really well... and the twist definately suprised me.
