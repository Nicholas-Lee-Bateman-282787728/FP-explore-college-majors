355546,A3PERVDBNCQJQV,6303092209,"Brian R Yandle ""Brian R Yandle""","[0, 0]","After having seen Bad Lieutenant from Abel Ferrara, I was rather disappointed in his next work of art. I think Keitel, Russo, & Madonna all did the best they could with this film but overall the film lacks the utter rawness or gritty feel that Ferrara normally supplies with gusto.Dangerous Game aims to be the gritty, dark drama which will reveal bits & pieces of human heart while attempting to explore human nature. The idea is undoubtedly reasonable & end results should be quite disturbing but the average viewer isn't going to have the patience to sit this one out. Ferrara could've made an excellent film which delves into the evil that lurks within Hollywood but he would've needed a stronger script. Unfortunately, weak scripts are a feat for even the best actors in the industry to pull off. Sadly, the film suffered greatly although it's clearly evident that each cast member does exhibit a great deal of talent.I did bestow a three star rating to the film because it doesn't lack tension but rather seems unfocused or incohesive. There really isn't a great deal of plot unfortunately but the film does have some powerful scenes including the marital abuse scenes which involve both Russo & Madonna or the scenes where Keitel bullies the male lead in hopes of attaining an edgier performance. Keitel's character even goes on to tell the lead that he doesn't care whether or not it requires less/more drugs to pull it off. Obviously, the Director cares very little for his actors & this brutal portrayal works extremely well.I also found the whole concept of domestic abuse/violence to be almost eerily haunting & I had to sometimes wonder if the film doesn't mirror the marriage of Madonna & Sean Penn. This vulnerable side of Madonna is one we don't often see on film & I think she crafted a very disturbing character here. It's a shame the editing here is shoddy & Ferrara has done much better directorial work.Abel Ferrara's meditation on life imitating art (and vice versa) is one of his weaker films but definitely not a complete waste of the viewer's time.",3,The Most Dangerous Games,1309219200,"06 28, 2011",2011,2073,"['having', 'seen', 'Bad', 'Lieutenant', 'Abel', 'Ferrara', 'was', 'rather', 'disappointed', 'next', 'work', 'art', 'think', 'Keitel', 'Russo', 'Madonna', 'did', 'best', 'could', 'film', 'film', 'utter', 'rawness', 'gritty', 'feel', 'Ferrara', 'normally', 'gusto.Dangerous', 'Game', 'be', 'gritty', 'dark', 'drama', 'will', 'reveal', 'bits', 'pieces', 'human', 'heart', 'attempting', 'explore', 'human', 'nature', 'idea', 'undoubtedly', 'reasonable', 'end', 'results', 'should', 'be', 'quite', 'disturbing', 'average', 'viewer', ""n't"", 'going', 'have', 'patience', 'sit', 'one', 'out', 'Ferrara', 'could', ""'ve"", 'made', 'excellent', 'film', 'evil', 'Hollywood', 'would', ""'ve"", 'needed', 'stronger', 'script', 'Unfortunately', 'weak', 'scripts', 'are', 'feat', 'even', 'best', 'actors', 'industry', 'pull', 'off', 'Sadly', 'film', 'suffered', 'greatly', 'clearly', 'evident', 'cast', 'member', 'exhibit', 'great', 'deal', 'talent.I', 'did', 'bestow', 'three', 'star', 'rating', 'film', ""n't"", 'lack', 'tension', 'rather', 'unfocused', 'incohesive', 'really', ""n't"", 'great', 'deal', 'plot', 'unfortunately', 'film', 'have', 'powerful', 'scenes', 'including', 'marital', 'abuse', 'scenes', 'involve', 'Russo', 'Madonna', 'scenes', 'where', 'Keitel', 'male', 'lead', 'hopes', 'attaining', 'edgier', 'performance', 'Keitel', 'character', 'even', 'tell', 'lead', ""n't"", 'care', 'not', 'less/more', 'drugs', 'pull', 'off', 'Obviously', 'Director', 'very', 'little', 'actors', 'brutal', 'portrayal', 'extremely', 'well.I', 'also', 'found', 'whole', 'concept', 'domestic', 'abuse/violence', 'be', 'almost', 'eerily', 'haunting', 'had', 'sometimes', 'wonder', 'film', ""n't"", 'mirror', 'marriage', 'Madonna', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'vulnerable', 'side', 'Madonna', 'one', 'do', ""n't"", 'often', 'see', 'film', 'think', 'crafted', 'very', 'disturbing', 'character', 'here', 'shame', 'editing', 'here', 'shoddy', 'Ferrara', 'done', 'much', 'better', 'directorial', 'work.Abel', 'Ferrara', 'meditation', 'life', 'imitating', 'art', 'vice', 'versa', 'one', 'weaker', 'films', 'definitely', 'not', 'complete', 'waste', 'viewer', 'time']",Dangerous Game VHS
355547,A3I7YI4NMP6SV8,6303092209,"B. Wells ""CineMan""","[3, 3]","It has become so commonplace for critics (professional and armchair alike) to trash Madonna's film outings that when she does deliver a solid performance, hardly anyone sees or hears about it.  Such is the case with Abel Ferrara's 1993 box office bomb, ""Dangerous Game"".  With a Hollywood backdrop, the film chronicles the agonies and ecstasies (mostly agonies) of a highly volatile and unstable group of people attempting to get a movie completed. As the tensions in the film spill over into the real lives of the actors and director, an atmosphere of escalating insanity develops, turning the movie set into a breeding ground for out-of-control behavior.  Although ""Dangerous Game"" was produced by Madonna's (former) company, Maverick, make no mistake about it, this is an Abel Ferrara film all the way down the line.  It is tough, dark, and uncompromising, which is probably one of the reasons why many people seem to hate this film. Ferrara gained earlier fame with the gritty ""Bad Lieutenant"" and ""Ms. 45"", so a viewer familiar with those films will already have an idea what to expect from ""Dangerous Game"".Harvey Keitel, as always, does a stellar job.  Here he plays a New York film director, leaving his family to fly to L.A. and make an extremely disturbing film about infidelity and abuse. Keitel, with his frazzled hair and craggy face, realistically portrays the increasing isolation of his character from his wife and son, eventually sinking into despair and disillusionment.  James Russo, as the male lead of the film-within-a-film, excels at playing psychopaths, and here he's walking a fine line as a man descending into a drug and alcohol induced world of paranoid madness.  He's a good actor and gives a convincing performance but his constant carrying-on in this film does get wearying.  Of course, as stated above, the real revelation comes from Madonna's (pardon the pun) immaculate performance as the film's female lead.  She is totally believable in a role that calls for her to exhibit acting chops I never dreamed she had.  Too many bad roles in bad movies have, I believe, led most people to stereotype her as a bad actress, but that's really not true.  She's done good work in other films (""Evita"", Desperately Seeking Susan"", ""Dick Tracy"") but she's won notoriety for ""Swept Away"", ""Who's That Girl?"", ""The Next Best Thing"",and ""Shanghai Surprise"", and that's what most people think about when they hear the words Madonna and movie used in the same sentence.  In ""Dangerous Game"" she's a gorgeous, frightened, overgrown kid trying to act like a tough grownup, and, in the process, becoming an eternal victim. It's easily Madonna's best acting job, and it's obvious that she had to reach deep within herself to deliver a performance of this range and quality.The film itself is too relentlessly despairing and depressing.  Despite the fine cinematography, there's an underlying ugliness to the film; it's an extremely effective and disturbing film, without ever being enjoyable, and maybe that's what killed it at the box office.  Worth a look if you're aware of what you're getting into.",4,Madonna's Finest (Celluloid) Moment,1215561600,"07 9, 2008",2008,3115,"['become', 'so', 'commonplace', 'critics', 'professional', 'armchair', 'alike', 'trash', 'Madonna', 'film', 'outings', 'when', 'deliver', 'solid', 'performance', 'hardly', 'anyone', 'Such', 'case', 'Abel', 'Ferrara', '1993', 'box', 'office', 'bomb', 'Dangerous', 'Game', 'Hollywood', 'backdrop', 'film', 'agonies', 'ecstasies', 'mostly', 'highly', 'volatile', 'unstable', 'group', 'people', 'attempting', 'get', 'movie', 'completed', 'tensions', 'film', 'spill', 'real', 'lives', 'actors', 'director', 'atmosphere', 'escalating', 'insanity', 'turning', 'movie', 'set', 'breeding', 'ground', 'out-of-control', 'behavior', 'Dangerous', 'Game', 'was', 'produced', 'Madonna', 'former', 'company', 'Maverick', 'make', 'mistake', 'Abel', 'Ferrara', 'film', 'way', 'line', 'tough', 'dark', 'uncompromising', 'probably', 'one', 'reasons', 'why', 'many', 'people', 'seem', 'hate', 'film', 'Ferrara', 'gained', 'earlier', 'fame', 'gritty', 'Bad', 'Lieutenant', 'Ms.', '45', 'viewer', 'familiar', 'films', 'will', 'already', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'expect', 'Dangerous', 'Game', '.Harvey', 'Keitel', 'always', 'stellar', 'job', 'Here', 'New', 'York', 'film', 'director', 'leaving', 'family', 'fly', 'L.A.', 'make', 'extremely', 'disturbing', 'film', 'infidelity', 'abuse', 'Keitel', 'frazzled', 'hair', 'craggy', 'face', 'realistically', 'increasing', 'isolation', 'character', 'wife', 'son', 'eventually', 'sinking', 'despair', 'disillusionment', 'James', 'Russo', 'male', 'lead', 'film-within-a-film', 'excels', 'playing', 'psychopaths', 'here', 'walking', 'fine', 'line', 'man', 'descending', 'drug', 'alcohol', 'induced', 'world', 'paranoid', 'madness', 'good', 'actor', 'convincing', 'performance', 'constant', 'carrying-on', 'film', 'get', 'wearying', 'course', 'stated', 'real', 'revelation', 'Madonna', 'pardon', 'pun', 'immaculate', 'performance', 'film', 'female', 'lead', 'totally', 'believable', 'role', 'exhibit', 'acting', 'chops', 'never', 'dreamed', 'had', 'Too', 'many', 'bad', 'roles', 'bad', 'movies', 'have', 'believe', 'led', 'most', 'people', 'stereotype', 'bad', 'actress', 'really', 'not', 'true', 'done', 'good', 'work', 'other', 'films', 'Evita', 'Desperately', 'Seeking', 'Susan', 'Dick', 'Tracy', 'won', 'notoriety', 'Swept', 'Away', 'Who', 'Girl', 'Next', 'Best', 'Thing', 'Shanghai', 'Surprise', 'what', 'most', 'people', 'think', 'when', 'hear', 'words', 'Madonna', 'movie', 'used', 'same', 'sentence', 'Dangerous', 'Game', 'gorgeous', 'frightened', 'overgrown', 'kid', 'trying', 'act', 'tough', 'grownup', 'process', 'becoming', 'eternal', 'victim', 'easily', 'Madonna', 'best', 'acting', 'job', 'obvious', 'had', 'reach', 'deep', 'deliver', 'performance', 'range', 'quality.The', 'film', 'too', 'relentlessly', 'despairing', 'depressing', 'fine', 'cinematography', 'underlying', 'ugliness', 'film', 'extremely', 'effective', 'disturbing', 'film', 'ever', 'being', 'enjoyable', 'maybe', 'what', 'killed', 'box', 'office', 'look', ""'re"", 'aware', 'what', ""'re"", 'getting']",Dangerous Game VHS

It's just a film about the making of a film.  There really isn't any plot.  But the film has many powerful scenes, and there is almost an unbearable tension on this film set, as Keitel is deliberately screwing around with Russo's character (bullying him, yelling at him), he's having sex with Madonna's character (in order to ""build up"" her character), and Keitel's wife (played by the then Mrs. Ferrara) ends up furious at him when she is told about it.  It's really a very brutal portrayal of the film world.  Not all films are like this obviously, but there are many who probably are.  Abel Ferrara's film has a power to it, and I'm not really sure why.  Madonna actually gives one of her best performances, playing a real person as opposed to just being Madonna, which she usually does.  James Russo sears the screen as usual.  It's a shame he isn't better known, as he is a superlative actor.  And Keitel is, well, Keitel, giving another great performance here.  I really have no idea why critics dumped on this one.  Perhaps it's their dislike of Madonna movies, and given her track record, one can't blame them.

355554,A3VO8JQT6LVXZ1,6303092209,Richard Ross,"[2, 2]","This review is written by an Abel fan rather than a Madonna fan who I think is unbearable in this movie. She stars as Sarah Jennings an actress who has just landed the lead role in a film called Mother of Mirrors. The film  deals with a married couple who have lived a  lifestyle that includes heavy drug use and sex with multiple partners. The wife has had a spiritual awakening and no longer wants to partake in these sinful activities. She's  hoping that her husband will stop as well and she makes it her mission to save him. The husband doesn't want to hear it and he beats her and taunts her about her new found faith. Directing this film is Eddie Israel (Harvey Keitel). The fact that Keitel is playing a character very similar to director Abel Ferrara is what makes this challenging film worth the effort. The film within a film Mother of Mirrors is similar to Abel's relationship with his ex-wife Nancy. (Nancy even plays Eddie's wife in the movie.) Keitel completely captures Abel complete with the long hair, leather coat, and shades that Ferrara frequently wears.  More than a physical transformation Keitel shows how Abel works with his actors: tender when he needs to be and violent and confrontational when the scene isn't working. This film feels a lot like David Lynch's Inland Empire as what is taking place in the fake movie begins to happen to the actors in their everyday lives. Sarah and Burns (James Russo) the actor playing her husband are actually having an off screen relationship that is becoming more violent as the film shoot progresses. Burns is fueled by heavy drug use which holds up shooting and leads to confrontations between him and Eddie. To further complicate things Eddie has even begun sleeping with Sarah. At times trying to figure out what  is in the movie and what is actually happening can be confusing but mostly it's just annoying. The acting from Madonna and James Russo doesn't help any since they are both so grating and whine constantly. Keitel is the saving grace of the film turning in a fine performance but he alone  can't save things. The film  just plunges deeper and deeper into violence and drug use. What makes this film interesting for Abel fans is in watching this fictionalized account of his life and wondering how much of it is true. There is a scene towards the end of the film where Eddie confesses to Nancy that he has been sleeping with Sarah and the two women missed each other by seconds once when Nancy brought the kids to the  set to pay him a visit. Eddie digs the knife deeper by admitting that Sarah wasn't the first that there have been numerous others on each film he has worked on. Eddie's timing couldn't be better since the time he chooses to get things off his chest happens to be the morning of Nancy's father's funeral. There is another interesting moment where Eddie ridicules Sarah and tells her that without him she would be nothing. He is doing her a favor by casting her in this movie and he is solely responsible for her career taking off. Madonna's production company Maverick produced this film and no doubt contributed money to the film. Abel probably would have had trouble getting this film made were it not for Madonna's participation.  It fails to be as good as Bad Lieutenant even though it takes the same raw approach. Near the end of the film when things are looking hopeless for everyone especially Eddie who is lost in a haze of pills and booze he watches a documentary with director Werner Herzog. Herzog says that even if everyone tells him that the film is a masterpiece he will never be able to justify it to himself and thinks that he should be put in an insane asylum. The ending is certainly a downer as each character meets their dark fate and once Bob Dylan starts singing Blue Moon over the end credits you are glad that this Abel exercise is finally over.",3,Ferrara and Keitel re team for this frustrating drama,1225065600,"10 27, 2008",2008,3867,"['review', 'written', 'Abel', 'fan', 'rather', 'Madonna', 'fan', 'who', 'think', 'unbearable', 'movie', 'Sarah', 'Jennings', 'actress', 'who', 'just', 'landed', 'lead', 'role', 'film', 'called', 'Mother', 'Mirrors', 'film', 'deals', 'married', 'couple', 'who', 'have', 'lived', 'lifestyle', 'heavy', 'drug', 'use', 'sex', 'multiple', 'partners', 'wife', 'had', 'spiritual', 'awakening', 'longer', 'partake', 'sinful', 'activities', 'hoping', 'husband', 'will', 'stop', 'as', 'well', 'mission', 'save', 'husband', ""n't"", 'want', 'hear', 'new', 'found', 'faith', 'Directing', 'film', 'Eddie', 'Israel', 'Harvey', 'Keitel', 'fact', 'Keitel', 'playing', 'character', 'very', 'similar', 'director', 'Abel', 'Ferrara', 'what', 'challenging', 'film', 'effort', 'film', 'film', 'Mother', 'Mirrors', 'similar', 'Abel', 'relationship', 'ex-wife', 'Nancy', 'Nancy', 'even', 'Eddie', 'wife', 'movie', 'Keitel', 'completely', 'Abel', 'complete', 'long', 'hair', 'leather', 'coat', 'shades', 'Ferrara', 'frequently', 'More', 'physical', 'transformation', 'Keitel', 'how', 'Abel', 'actors', 'tender', 'when', 'be', 'violent', 'confrontational', 'when', 'scene', ""n't"", 'working', 'film', 'lot', 'David', 'Lynch', 'Inland', 'Empire', 'what', 'taking', 'place', 'fake', 'movie', 'happen', 'actors', 'everyday', 'lives', 'Sarah', 'Burns', 'James', 'Russo', 'actor', 'playing', 'husband', 'are', 'actually', 'having', 'off', 'screen', 'relationship', 'becoming', 'more', 'violent', 'film', 'shoot', 'Burns', 'fueled', 'heavy', 'drug', 'use', 'shooting', 'confrontations', 'Eddie', 'further', 'complicate', 'things', 'Eddie', 'even', 'begun', 'sleeping', 'Sarah', 'times', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'movie', 'what', 'actually', 'happening', 'can', 'be', 'confusing', 'mostly', 'just', 'annoying', 'acting', 'Madonna', 'James', 'Russo', ""n't"", 'help', 'are', 'grating', 'whine', 'constantly', 'Keitel', 'saving', 'grace', 'film', 'turning', 'fine', 'performance', 'alone', 'ca', ""n't"", 'save', 'things', 'film', 'just', 'deeper', 'deeper', 'violence', 'drug', 'use', 'What', 'film', 'interesting', 'Abel', 'fans', 'watching', 'fictionalized', 'account', 'life', 'wondering', 'how', 'much', 'true', 'scene', 'end', 'film', 'where', 'Eddie', 'Nancy', 'been', 'sleeping', 'Sarah', 'two', 'women', 'missed', 'other', 'seconds', 'once', 'when', 'Nancy', 'brought', 'kids', 'set', 'pay', 'visit', 'Eddie', 'knife', 'deeper', 'admitting', 'Sarah', 'was', ""n't"", 'first', 'have', 'been', 'numerous', 'others', 'film', 'worked', 'Eddie', 'timing', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'better', 'time', 'get', 'things', 'off', 'chest', 'be', 'morning', 'Nancy', 'father', 'funeral', 'interesting', 'moment', 'where', 'Eddie', 'Sarah', 'would', 'be', 'nothing', 'doing', 'favor', 'casting', 'movie', 'solely', 'responsible', 'career', 'taking', 'off', 'Madonna', 'production', 'company', 'Maverick', 'produced', 'film', 'doubt', 'contributed', 'money', 'film', 'Abel', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'trouble', 'getting', 'film', 'made', 'were', 'not', 'Madonna', 'participation', 'be', 'as', 'good', 'Bad', 'Lieutenant', 'even', 'same', 'raw', 'approach', 'end', 'film', 'when', 'things', 'are', 'looking', 'hopeless', 'everyone', 'especially', 'Eddie', 'who', 'lost', 'haze', 'pills', 'booze', 'documentary', 'director', 'Werner', 'Herzog', 'Herzog', 'even', 'everyone', 'film', 'masterpiece', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'able', 'justify', 'should', 'be', 'put', 'insane', 'asylum', 'ending', 'certainly', 'downer', 'character', 'dark', 'fate', 'once', 'Bob', 'Dylan', 'singing', 'Blue', 'Moon', 'end', 'are', 'glad', 'Abel', 'exercise', 'finally', 'over']",Dangerous Game VHS

I didn't get around to watching it till today. And I have to say this movie sucks.... in the worst way. The only reason I gave this movie two stars is because of Madonnas emotional acting. I think she did a good job. Other wise it would have gotten one star. If I am able to I would have gave it no stars.,2,sucked,1324166400,"12 18, 2011",2011,408,"['movie', 'was', 'recommended', 'threw', 'amazon', 'like', 'Madonna', 'bought', 'movie', 'few', 'months', 'ago', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'watching', 'till', 'today', 'have', 'say', 'movie', 'worst', 'way', 'only', 'reason', 'gave', 'movie', 'two', 'stars', 'Madonnas', 'emotional', 'acting', 'think', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'Other', 'wise', 'would', 'have', 'gotten', 'one', 'star', 'am', 'able', 'would', 'have', 'gave', 'stars']",Dangerous Game VHS
