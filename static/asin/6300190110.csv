In ""Les comperes"" from 1983, Francis Veber gave us another comedy classic (this was not a sequel to ""La chevre"", but admittedly the main characters were very identical). Some of the skits here were even funnier than in ""La chevre"". Like the scene where 'Pignon' (Richard), tried to pass-off as hip to a biker-gang on the French Riviera, in order to get some information on a runaway-teen that may or may not be his son (hilariously funny stuff)! Or when he accidentally came upon 'Jeannot' (Roland Blanche) after two mobsters had worked him over, and he began to give him counseling because he sensed he was a depressive like himself! These scenes and others like it, can only be compared to the cinematic giants of comedy. Pure classic stuff, that will not offend anyone. A must see, if you're badly in need of a good laugh! NTSC, French (English subtitles), NR 92 mins. (BTW: If you ever have the chance, catch Pierre Richard in Yves Robert's ""Le grand blond avec une chaussure noire"" 1972 and its equally funny sequel).Love and Peace,Carlos Romero",5,Richard and Depardieu....Together Again..,1339372800,"06 11, 2012",2012,1106,"['Richard', 'Depardieu', 'were', 'back', 'funnier', 'ever', 'Les', 'comperes', '1983', 'Francis', 'Veber', 'gave', 'comedy', 'classic', 'was', 'not', 'sequel', 'La', 'chevre', 'admittedly', 'main', 'characters', 'were', 'very', 'identical', 'skits', 'here', 'were', 'even', 'funnier', 'La', 'chevre', 'scene', 'where', ""'Pignon"", 'Richard', 'tried', 'pass-off', 'hip', 'biker-gang', 'French', 'Riviera', 'order', 'get', 'information', 'runaway-teen', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'son', 'hilariously', 'funny', 'stuff', 'when', 'accidentally', 'came', ""'Jeannot"", 'Roland', 'Blanche', 'two', 'mobsters', 'had', 'worked', 'began', 'give', 'counseling', 'sensed', 'was', 'depressive', 'scenes', 'others', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'compared', 'cinematic', 'giants', 'comedy', 'Pure', 'classic', 'stuff', 'will', 'not', 'offend', 'anyone', 'must', 'see', ""'re"", 'badly', 'need', 'good', 'laugh', 'NTSC', 'French', 'English', 'subtitles', 'NR', '92', 'mins', 'ever', 'have', 'chance', 'catch', 'Pierre', 'Richard', 'Yves', 'Robert', 'Le', 'grand', 'blond', 'avec', 'une', 'chaussure', 'noire', '1972', 'equally', 'funny', 'sequel', '.Love', 'Peace', 'Carlos', 'Romero']",N/A
206712,A2P49WD75WHAG5,6300190110,Daniel J. Hamlow,"[21, 22]","Fed up with his father getting on his case, Tristan Martin, age sixteen-and-a-half and a dead ringer for someone in Menudo, has run away from his home in Paris, accompanied by Shannon Doherty-lookalike Michele Raffart, to Nice.  His parents, Paul and Carol, report his disappearance to the police, who don't seem to care.  It's like a stolen car-the question is, when will it turn up?  A visit to Michele's rough-speaking father yields nothing.Fed up with her husband's weakness in handling the situation, Carol turns to an ex-beau from seventeen years before, Jean Lucas, a journalist whose book hinted at a connection between a prominent French senator and Rossi, the gambling kingpin of the Riviera.  She tells him that Tristan is actually his son so she can get his help.  He refuses because he doesn't buy her story or motives, so Carol turns to Francois Pignon, a former schoolteacher and depressive who being the romantic idealist that he is, is only so glad to be reunited with his son.  &quot;I've no job, my wife has left me, I live with my mother and hate it.  I've no plans, no future, everything is scr---d up... great, isn't it?&quot;  Things get really cockeyed when Jean changes his mind, with Carol and Francois none the wiser.  Jean is planning a sequel on his book, which could lead to his boss sending him a wreath.Through circumstances, Jean and Francois are united in their perceived common quest, and we see the differences in their personalities straight off.  Even before they meet Tristan or realize the connection between them, the adventurous Jean envisions Tristan as someone like himself, a little brute, strong as an ox, and a fighter, while the nurturing Francois sees Tristan as a dreamer, moody, alienated, writing poetry.  Also, Jean is tough, which comes in handy when they get in trouble with the leather-clad bikers Tristan hangs out with.  Francois, having just suffered a breakdown, has tendencies to cry for no apparent reason.  They go to Nice in Jean's snazzy-looking BMW, at least snazzy for a while.  Hint--what else does BMW stand for?  And where Jean goes, trouble follows, in the form of two toughs sent by Rossi to intimidate, and later, to kill him.One of the main things to come out of this story is that, as Francois and Jean, the latter whose fathering attitude towards Tristan comes and goes, learn, is that fatherhood must be earned.  That's something that Paul, Tristan's father should have learned.  His defense that he cared for him well and gave him all he wanted, well, doesn't cut the surface.  There's understanding as well.  And as for Tristan, he's not a bad kid, just a teenager undergoing growing pains who needed a stronger sense of understanding from his parents, and the right sort of understanding, which comes from Jean and Francois, who actually take a caring interest in him.  His outing proves to develop his character.Having seen this road trip comedy three times in one year, I can say right now it's one of my favourite French films of all time.  Gerard Depardieu (Jean) is still the solid, tall, handsome box office draw that he was in France, and I feel an affinity towards curly-haired Pierre Richard (Francois), best known as &quot;the tall blond man with one black shoe&quot; Having seen this, I'd have wanted a father like Francois, caring, emotional, someone with feeling even if a bit too melodramatic.",5,Pleasant and funny road trip about a boy w. two dads,1069891200,"11 27, 2003",2003,3387,"['Fed', 'up', 'father', 'getting', 'case', 'Tristan', 'Martin', 'age', 'sixteen-and-a-half', 'dead', 'ringer', 'someone', 'Menudo', 'run', 'away', 'home', 'Paris', 'accompanied', 'Shannon', 'Doherty-lookalike', 'Michele', 'Raffart', 'Nice', 'parents', 'Paul', 'Carol', 'report', 'disappearance', 'police', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'care', 'stolen', 'car-the', 'question', 'when', 'will', 'turn', 'up', 'visit', 'Michele', 'rough-speaking', 'father', 'yields', 'nothing.Fed', 'up', 'husband', 'weakness', 'handling', 'situation', 'Carol', 'ex-beau', 'seventeen', 'years', 'Jean', 'Lucas', 'journalist', 'book', 'hinted', 'connection', 'prominent', 'French', 'senator', 'Rossi', 'gambling', 'kingpin', 'Riviera', 'Tristan', 'actually', 'son', 'can', 'get', 'help', ""n't"", 'buy', 'story', 'motives', 'so', 'Carol', 'Francois', 'Pignon', 'former', 'schoolteacher', 'depressive', 'who', 'being', 'romantic', 'idealist', 'only', 'so', 'glad', 'be', 'reunited', 'son', 'quot', ""'ve"", 'job', 'wife', 'left', 'live', 'mother', 'hate', ""'ve"", 'plans', 'future', 'everything', 'scr', '-d', 'up', 'great', ""n't"", 'quot', 'Things', 'get', 'really', 'cockeyed', 'when', 'Jean', 'changes', 'mind', 'Carol', 'Francois', 'none', 'wiser', 'Jean', 'planning', 'sequel', 'book', 'could', 'lead', 'boss', 'sending', 'wreath.Through', 'circumstances', 'Jean', 'Francois', 'are', 'united', 'perceived', 'common', 'quest', 'see', 'differences', 'personalities', 'straight', 'off', 'Even', 'meet', 'Tristan', 'realize', 'connection', 'adventurous', 'Jean', 'envisions', 'Tristan', 'someone', 'little', 'brute', 'strong', 'ox', 'fighter', 'nurturing', 'Francois', 'Tristan', 'dreamer', 'moody', 'alienated', 'writing', 'poetry', 'Also', 'Jean', 'tough', 'handy', 'when', 'get', 'trouble', 'leather-clad', 'bikers', 'Tristan', 'out', 'Francois', 'having', 'just', 'suffered', 'breakdown', 'tendencies', 'cry', 'apparent', 'reason', 'go', 'Nice', 'Jean', 'snazzy-looking', 'BMW', 'least', 'snazzy', 'while', 'Hint', 'what', 'else', 'BMW', 'stand', 'where', 'Jean', 'trouble', 'form', 'two', 'toughs', 'sent', 'Rossi', 'intimidate', 'later', 'kill', 'him.One', 'main', 'things', 'come', 'story', 'Francois', 'Jean', 'latter', 'fathering', 'attitude', 'towards', 'Tristan', 'learn', 'fatherhood', 'must', 'be', 'earned', 'something', 'Paul', 'Tristan', 'father', 'should', 'have', 'learned', 'defense', 'cared', 'well', 'gave', 'wanted', 'well', ""n't"", 'cut', 'surface', 'understanding', 'as', 'well', 'Tristan', 'not', 'bad', 'kid', 'just', 'teenager', 'undergoing', 'growing', 'pains', 'who', 'needed', 'stronger', 'sense', 'understanding', 'parents', 'right', 'sort', 'understanding', 'Jean', 'Francois', 'who', 'actually', 'take', 'caring', 'interest', 'outing', 'proves', 'develop', 'character.Having', 'seen', 'road', 'trip', 'comedy', 'three', 'times', 'one', 'year', 'can', 'say', 'right', 'now', 'one', 'favourite', 'French', 'films', 'time', 'Gerard', 'Depardieu', 'Jean', 'still', 'solid', 'tall', 'handsome', 'box', 'office', 'draw', 'was', 'France', 'feel', 'affinity', 'curly-haired', 'Pierre', 'Richard', 'Francois', 'best', 'known', 'quot', 'tall', 'blond', 'man', 'one', 'black', 'shoe', 'quot', 'Having', 'seen', ""'d"", 'have', 'wanted', 'father', 'Francois', 'caring', 'emotional', 'someone', 'feeling', 'even', 'bit', 'too', 'melodramatic']",N/A

There were other times when I thought it was predictable and the humor just too broad.As usual, Depardieu is very funny, but Pierre Richard is equally funny. Depardieu and Richard have both been told that they are the father of a runaway teenager -- the mother figures if they think it's their kid, they'll go looking for him and bring him back.  Her husband -- the kid's father - isn't doing anything.  Eventually they realize they are both possibly the kid's father (or so they think) so they team up to look for him -- in Nice, where Depardieu is investigating corruption in the casinos.  Depardieu is a rough newspaper reporter, whereas Richard is a depressed ex-schoolteacher, so you have the odd-couple thing going.There's a lot of broad, tough guy humor -- cars getting vandalized, gangsters stalking Gepardieu & Richard, teenage hoodlums, fist fights, that sort of thing.

206716,A3OB3WDUN51D8A,6300190110,Sterling,"[0, 0]","The first time I saw Depardieu and Richard team up was in the 1981 film La Chevre, which became a Worldwide hit as one of the funniest films. It had a few weaknesses, like the gorilla in Mexico, which suggested that the makers were not totally serious in striving to make a perfect film and did not expect it to become such a huge hit. Yet, La Chevre was a comedy magic.Thus, I was excited to see the next Depardieu - Richard collaboration, the 1983 Les Comperes. Alas, I was somewhat disappointed. Les Comperes is not as funny, nor as engaging as La Chevre. I had the feeling that Depardieu and Richard did not quite have their hearts in it. It almost felt like a sequel. Depardieu again played the bully and Richard again was the nerd. Although the main story is great, many of the comic scenes were reworked versions from La Chevre. Further, the supporting cast was not as good as in La Chevre. In particular, the actor playing Tristan, the son that run away, did not fit and was not believable.If you have not seen La Chevre, you will find Les Comperes enjoyable and better than most comedies.",4,Enjoyable and funny,1249776000,"08 9, 2009",2009,1097,"['first', 'time', 'saw', 'Depardieu', 'Richard', 'team', 'up', 'was', '1981', 'film', 'La', 'Chevre', 'became', 'Worldwide', 'hit', 'one', 'funniest', 'films', 'had', 'few', 'weaknesses', 'gorilla', 'Mexico', 'suggested', 'makers', 'were', 'not', 'totally', 'serious', 'striving', 'make', 'perfect', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'expect', 'become', 'such', 'huge', 'hit', 'La', 'Chevre', 'was', 'comedy', 'magic.Thus', 'was', 'excited', 'see', 'next', 'Depardieu', 'Richard', 'collaboration', '1983', 'Les', 'Comperes', 'Alas', 'was', 'somewhat', 'disappointed', 'Les', 'Comperes', 'not', 'funny', 'as', 'engaging', 'La', 'Chevre', 'had', 'feeling', 'Depardieu', 'Richard', 'did', 'not', 'quite', 'have', 'hearts', 'almost', 'felt', 'sequel', 'Depardieu', 'again', 'played', 'bully', 'Richard', 'again', 'was', 'nerd', 'main', 'story', 'great', 'many', 'comic', 'scenes', 'were', 'reworked', 'versions', 'La', 'Chevre', 'Further', 'supporting', 'cast', 'was', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'La', 'Chevre', 'particular', 'actor', 'playing', 'Tristan', 'son', 'away', 'did', 'not', 'fit', 'was', 'not', 'believable.If', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'La', 'Chevre', 'will', 'find', 'Les', 'Comperes', 'enjoyable', 'better', 'most', 'comedies']",N/A
