970029,AQ8DU6XVA3USJ,B000E6GDXS,"Alejandra Vernon ""artist & illustrator""","[8, 10]","You don't have to be pregnant to get tremendous benefit from the instruction on this DVD; if you're someone who needs gentle exercise but hates to ""exercise,"" this is a great one to have in your DVD collection, because even though you get the advantages of exercise, such as relaxation, stress relief, and over time, body toning, you will feel as though you're dancing from the start. Starting with 4 warm-ups that have movements that prepare you and become the basis for a short dance combination, the choreography is so expertly done that you can feel the release of tension immediately. By the time you've done the final ""Cool Down,"" you'll be refreshed and invigorated. For those that want an easier option on some of the movements, there is an insert that comes on the screen with Naia demonstrating a simpler move.Naia, at 7 months pregnant, is so incredibly beautiful and graceful, she's an inspiration to those who are pregnant, and who may feel out of sorts and even have a touch of the ""uglies."" That applies also to those who may not be expecting, but maybe have a couple of unwanted pounds on their hips to lose! Naia demonstrates the moves with clarity, and her narration, with a lovely soft voice, is instructive and a pleasure to listen to. Once you have the movements learned, you also have the option to play this DVD without the narration, just with music, which is by bellydance expert, dancer and composer Jihan, and very pleasing. Neon, the Russian born beauty who is a dazzling dancer and teacher, did the choreography, and it is perfect for anyone who wants not only prenatal fitness, but stress release after a hard day of work, or gentle exercise if you're out of shape or one of the ""over 50"" crowd. You'll feel like you had a trip to the oasis after this session with Naia!",5,You Don't Have to Be Pregnant to Benefit,1178668800,"05 9, 2007",2007,1800,"['do', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'pregnant', 'get', 'tremendous', 'benefit', 'instruction', 'DVD', ""'re"", 'someone', 'who', 'gentle', 'exercise', 'exercise', 'great', 'one', 'have', 'DVD', 'collection', 'even', 'get', 'advantages', 'exercise', 'such', 'relaxation', 'stress', 'relief', 'time', 'body', 'toning', 'will', 'feel', ""'re"", 'dancing', 'start', 'Starting', '4', 'warm-ups', 'have', 'movements', 'prepare', 'become', 'basis', 'short', 'dance', 'combination', 'choreography', 'so', 'expertly', 'done', 'can', 'feel', 'release', 'tension', 'immediately', 'time', ""'ve"", 'done', 'final', 'Cool', 'Down', ""'ll"", 'be', 'refreshed', 'invigorated', 'want', 'easier', 'option', 'movements', 'insert', 'screen', 'Naia', 'demonstrating', 'simpler', 'move.Naia', '7', 'months', 'pregnant', 'so', 'incredibly', 'beautiful', 'graceful', 'inspiration', 'who', 'are', 'pregnant', 'who', 'may', 'feel', 'sorts', 'even', 'have', 'touch', 'uglies', 'applies', 'also', 'who', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'expecting', 'maybe', 'have', 'couple', 'unwanted', 'pounds', 'hips', 'lose', 'Naia', 'moves', 'clarity', 'narration', 'lovely', 'soft', 'voice', 'instructive', 'pleasure', 'listen', 'Once', 'have', 'movements', 'learned', 'also', 'have', 'option', 'play', 'DVD', 'narration', 'just', 'music', 'bellydance', 'expert', 'dancer', 'composer', 'Jihan', 'very', 'pleasing', 'Neon', 'Russian', 'born', 'beauty', 'who', 'dazzling', 'dancer', 'teacher', 'did', 'choreography', 'perfect', 'anyone', 'who', 'not', 'only', 'prenatal', 'fitness', 'stress', 'release', 'hard', 'day', 'work', 'gentle', 'exercise', ""'re"", 'shape', 'one', '50', 'crowd', ""'ll"", 'feel', 'had', 'trip', 'oasis', 'session', 'Naia']",N/A

It's easy to do in loose comfortable clothes (I still can't get the quick moving steps down though).  It gets your heart rate up and really stretches your back and hips well.  I haven't been able to do it a lot because I have had really bad sciatic nerve pain (from the way my baby is sitting) but really look forward to doing the workout after baby to get my shape back!  You can do this video with spoken and shown instruction or without spoken (so you could make up your own steps to the music if you wanted).  Excellent video-I think it's a good workout for people that aren't pregnant also!,5,Great mostly gentle workout!,1202428800,"02 8, 2008",2008,703,"['LOVED', 'video', 'purchased', 'right', '3rd', 'trimester', 'wish', 'would', 'have', 'bought', 'earlier', 'easy', 'do', 'loose', 'comfortable', 'clothes', 'still', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'quick', 'moving', 'steps', 'down', 'heart', 'rate', 'really', 'stretches', 'back', 'hips', 'well', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'able', 'do', 'lot', 'have', 'had', 'really', 'bad', 'sciatic', 'nerve', 'pain', 'way', 'baby', 'sitting', 'really', 'look', 'forward', 'doing', 'workout', 'baby', 'get', 'shape', 'back', 'can', 'do', 'video', 'spoken', 'shown', 'instruction', 'spoken', 'could', 'make', 'up', 'own', 'steps', 'music', 'wanted', 'Excellent', 'video-I', 'think', 'good', 'workout', 'people', 'are', ""n't"", 'pregnant', 'also']",N/A
970031,A30OGYCJM4B10S,B000E6GDXS,atisheh,"[1, 1]","I recently worked with Naia's Bellydance Prenatal Fitness for the first time, and can report the following: this is a useful little workout if you are pregnant, tired, but want to move a little anyway. It is not strenuous in the slightest, which could be good or bad depending on your point of view.If you are a pregnant lady who has done years of bellydance and wants to keep running marathons in the third trimester, you will probably not get much out this program. Just avoid it and avoid the disappointment. However, if you are a pregnant lady who hasn't been sleeping well, or who has a bit of back or knee pain, or who just does not want to commit to an hour-long workout that day, this is very good. I'm only in the second trimester and generally feel pretty energetic, but I expect this will only come in more handy as I get further along. I also think it could be useful outside of pregnancy on days I'm lazy, want a simple 30 minutes of dancing around, or when I'm suffering from mild back pain and don't want to take chances with a more aggressive workout.Now to the program: it is divided into five sections, a warmup, lower and upper body, travel steps, and a bit of dance. The bellydance moves are quite basic, though I did find myself a bit confused in the travel steps section. (This is not my strong suit, so I would have liked a little slower instruction here -- but it's also something to grow into.) There's quite a bit of emphasis on stretching, which felt very good. And there was precious little of the ""think about the miracle of life growing inside of you"" kind of talk which I have found in other prenatal videos, and which, frankly, drives me up the wall. (I'm not dancing for my fetus, I'm dancing for myself. My fetus can learn to dance once it comes into the world and has mastered the whole walking thing.)I corresponded a bit with Neon, who conceived and designed the video. She did quite a bit of research on pregnancy and labour to create this program. I'm not a medical expert, but I can confirm that there is nothing in this video that feels extreme or like it would put undue pressure on any part of the body. And given that everything I've read about prenatal exercise advises women to perform moves that bellydance incorporates anyway, I'd rather just do something that's like dance than a dozen boring pelvic tilts.",4,"Fun little workout, not strenuous or challenging",1318723200,"10 16, 2011",2011,2355,"['recently', 'worked', 'Naia', 'Bellydance', 'Prenatal', 'Fitness', 'first', 'time', 'can', 'report', 'following', 'useful', 'little', 'workout', 'are', 'pregnant', 'tired', 'want', 'move', 'little', 'anyway', 'not', 'strenuous', 'slightest', 'could', 'be', 'good', 'bad', 'depending', 'point', 'view.If', 'are', 'pregnant', 'lady', 'who', 'done', 'years', 'bellydance', 'keep', 'running', 'marathons', 'third', 'trimester', 'will', 'probably', 'not', 'get', 'much', 'out', 'program', 'Just', 'avoid', 'avoid', 'disappointment', 'However', 'are', 'pregnant', 'lady', 'who', ""n't"", 'been', 'sleeping', 'well', 'who', 'bit', 'back', 'knee', 'pain', 'who', 'just', 'not', 'want', 'commit', 'hour-long', 'workout', 'day', 'very', 'good', ""'m"", 'only', 'second', 'trimester', 'generally', 'feel', 'pretty', 'energetic', 'expect', 'will', 'only', 'come', 'more', 'handy', 'get', 'further', 'along', 'also', 'think', 'could', 'be', 'useful', 'pregnancy', 'days', ""'m"", 'lazy', 'want', 'simple', '30', 'minutes', 'dancing', 'around', 'when', ""'m"", 'suffering', 'mild', 'back', 'pain', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'take', 'chances', 'more', 'aggressive', 'workout.Now', 'program', 'divided', 'five', 'sections', 'warmup', 'lower', 'upper', 'body', 'travel', 'steps', 'bit', 'dance', 'bellydance', 'moves', 'are', 'quite', 'basic', 'did', 'find', 'bit', 'confused', 'travel', 'steps', 'section', 'not', 'strong', 'suit', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'little', 'slower', 'instruction', 'here', 'also', 'something', 'grow', 'quite', 'bit', 'emphasis', 'stretching', 'felt', 'very', 'good', 'was', 'precious', 'little', 'think', 'miracle', 'life', 'growing', 'kind', 'talk', 'have', 'found', 'other', 'prenatal', 'videos', 'frankly', 'drives', 'wall', ""'m"", 'not', 'dancing', 'fetus', ""'m"", 'dancing', 'fetus', 'can', 'learn', 'dance', 'once', 'world', 'mastered', 'whole', 'walking', 'thing', 'corresponded', 'bit', 'Neon', 'who', 'conceived', 'designed', 'video', 'did', 'quite', 'bit', 'research', 'pregnancy', 'labour', 'create', 'program', ""'m"", 'not', 'medical', 'expert', 'can', 'confirm', 'nothing', 'video', 'extreme', 'would', 'put', 'undue', 'pressure', 'part', 'body', 'given', 'everything', ""'ve"", 'read', 'prenatal', 'exercise', 'women', 'perform', 'moves', 'bellydance', 'anyway', ""'d"", 'rather', 'just', 'do', 'something', 'dance', 'dozen', 'boring', 'pelvic', 'tilts']",N/A

970033,A26M602UIR2R1J,B000E6GDXS,"Heather Kenyon-Haff ""VermontGal""","[16, 16]","OK, it's true that this workout isn't the most newbie-friendly--Naia does only a so-so job of actually breaking down and teaching the steps and movements, and cueing, especially in the last segment.But I don't think this means it's a bad workout. I've bought bad DVD workouts (including Middle Eastern dance workouts) and this isn't one of them!I'm of the school of thought that if I master the workout on the first go, it's not going to hold my interest. I can handle having some workouts that I miss a few counts...so what? I suppose if you're the personality that gives up if you don't get the steps and/ or movements right the first or second time, this workout isn't for you.I disagree it's not ""beginner""-level, although if you're looking for an introduction to Middle Eastern dance, I'd recommend other workouts. Naia could do a better job breaking down the steps and making the counts and cueing simplier.Also, I feel that for the money, it would be nice to have more features for the DVD. I like the ""music only"" feature, but besides that, there's not much. For the money I'd like more than one 30 minute workout, for one. Or a segment going into detail the various movements (always a good idea!) or SOMETHING MORE.I actually DO like this workout. It makes me feel looser, less cranky, and one of the few workouts that I feel graceful doing as I go into my 3rd trimester. I think it's worthwhile having in your pregnancy workout, even if there are some flaws.
