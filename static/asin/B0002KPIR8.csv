He paints a portrait full of masculine vigor, with enough lust in his heart for at least a dozen men, and his tough guy East End accent somehow works well too, though it is quite a change from the Richard Burton/King's English type of Henry VIII I have previously seen.There are scenes where he is memorable, like the emotion he expresses after Anne Boleyn (Helena Bonham Carter) gives birth to Princess Elizabeth.In his old age Henry becomes a sad and sickly figure, and Winstone realistically catches that aspect of him too.The rest of the large cast is also good, which includes David Suchet as Cardinal Wolsey, and Sean Bean in a role that is not long, but one of his most powerful, as Robert Aske, who goes against the king for having committed the brutal ""dissolution of the monasteries.""The plot starts in 1509, with the death of Henry VII, and the young Henry VIII marrying Katherine of Aragon, but quickly segues to 1524, and centers on the last 21 years of Henry's life, with still no male heir from Katherine, enter Anne Boleyn and the other wives, court intrigue, and manipulations by Cardinal Wolsey and Thomas Cromwell among those vying for power.It is also quite gritty and bloody, and not for the young or squeamish, including muddy, violent  battle and jousting scenes, lots of heads being chopped off, and even a dog fight, which fortunately is more heard than seen.Well paced direction by Pete Travis, script by Peter Morgan, cinematography by Peter Middleton, and score by Robert Lane, make this an engrossing, if not historically accurate film, and since the core of this production are the intimate scenes, artistic license is to be expected.Total running time is 250 minutes.",4,"history no, entertainment yes",1100390400,"11 14, 2004",2004,1819,"['found', 'TV', 'production', 'not', 'historical', 'highly', 'entertaining', '90', '%', 'Ray', 'Winstone', 'Henry', 'VIII', 'portrait', 'full', 'masculine', 'vigor', 'enough', 'lust', 'heart', 'least', 'dozen', 'men', 'tough', 'guy', 'East', 'End', 'accent', 'somehow', 'well', 'too', 'quite', 'change', 'Richard', 'Burton/King', 'English', 'type', 'Henry', 'VIII', 'have', 'previously', 'seen.There', 'are', 'scenes', 'where', 'memorable', 'emotion', 'Anne', 'Boleyn', 'Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'birth', 'Princess', 'Elizabeth.In', 'old', 'age', 'Henry', 'sad', 'sickly', 'figure', 'Winstone', 'realistically', 'aspect', 'too.The', 'rest', 'large', 'cast', 'also', 'good', 'David', 'Suchet', 'Cardinal', 'Wolsey', 'Sean', 'Bean', 'role', 'not', 'long', 'one', 'most', 'powerful', 'Robert', 'Aske', 'who', 'king', 'having', 'committed', 'brutal', 'dissolution', 'monasteries', 'plot', '1509', 'death', 'Henry', 'VII', 'young', 'Henry', 'VIII', 'marrying', 'Katherine', 'Aragon', 'quickly', 'segues', '1524', 'centers', 'last', '21', 'years', 'Henry', 'life', 'still', 'male', 'heir', 'Katherine', 'enter', 'Anne', 'Boleyn', 'other', 'wives', 'court', 'intrigue', 'manipulations', 'Cardinal', 'Wolsey', 'Thomas', 'Cromwell', 'vying', 'power.It', 'also', 'quite', 'gritty', 'bloody', 'not', 'young', 'squeamish', 'including', 'muddy', 'violent', 'battle', 'jousting', 'scenes', 'lots', 'heads', 'being', 'chopped', 'off', 'even', 'dog', 'fight', 'fortunately', 'more', 'heard', 'seen.Well', 'paced', 'direction', 'Pete', 'Travis', 'script', 'Peter', 'Morgan', 'cinematography', 'Peter', 'Middleton', 'score', 'Robert', 'Lane', 'make', 'engrossing', 'not', 'historically', 'accurate', 'film', 'core', 'production', 'are', 'intimate', 'scenes', 'artistic', 'license', 'be', 'expected.Total', 'running', 'time', '250', 'minutes']",N/A

One of the most uncomfortable scenes was where Henry and Cardinal Wosley share an ""man embrace"" after Henry holds open his arms and says ""come 'ere"" and Wosley sobs like a six year old in his arms apologizng, only to have Henry say ""too late"" and send him off to his death. How ridiculous?!I agree with the other post about the costumes, with every woman at court running around with their hair down and TOO TIGHT bodices. Helen Bonham Carter, who is a slim woman, looked like Fiona Shrek! There is so much more bad about this movie, I can't even get it all in.

But this production just isn't all that good, not on any level.  Just like many other reviewers have mentioned, a number of the principals, most notably Bonham Carter, turned in performances that range from the bizarre to the utterly disengaged.  Bonham Carter's performance rendered the historical Anne Boleyn unrecognizable to anyone familiar with the period.Of course, this would fit in with the production as a whole.  It is nothing new for these costume dramas to presume intimate knowledge on the part of the viewer of the historical period in question.  This production goes farther than most in putting demands on most viewers, even those who are reasonably well-aquainted with the Tudor period.  I would like to think that I have a decent enough grounding in that period, but there were more times than I can count that I was yanking Scarisbrick off the shelf to try and figure just what the hell was going on.All in all, this really was an unsatisfying experience, both from a historical & dramatic point of view.

838754,A3T2JX1MWYOCSE,B0002KPIR8,"Emma de Soleil ""I moved to the UK for another...","[5, 7]","I do not expect historical accuracy in every movie about Henry VIII like we've seen it in the BBC production with Keith Michell. Even the BBC production bears some inaccuracies and changes in its script but they do not contradict history like this one!Ah, where to begin? The actor chosen for Henry VIII was dreadfully miscast. The only resemblance was that he had red hair & that's it. The historical Henry VIII towered over everyone surrounding him at his court (He was 6''2, a very unusual height at the time), he didn't speak with a Cockney accent & didn't behave like a drunken brute. Henry VIII, for all that Hollywood attempts to change, was a king of refinement and knowledge. Despite being married to six women throughout his life he was a prude whose behavior towards women & the lords at his court was worthy of a king. I do not expect the genius of Keith Michell from every actor who portrays this role but here we've arrived at a new low! A Henry VIII hitting & raping his wives? Nothing we know of Henry (And his enemies would have been delighted to report such low behavior) suggests that he ever abused any of his wives in such a way. Not even Anne Boleyn or Catherine Howard suffered from his hands directly once he had chosen to send them to the block for whatever offense they may have committed but were left by him in cold blood.Aside from this the wives were portrayed awfully. Has any of the writers here read a history book? Katherine of Aragon was fair & blue eyed (Only the BBC productions got that right) & not slender, dark eyed & dark haired. She never spoke in such a fashion to Anne Boleyn for it would have been beyond her dignity to address the matter to anyone, much less to the lady who caused it. Helena Bonham Carter was too old to play 19 year old Anne, plus she was obviously pregnant.It goes on and on.... Breaches of etiquette, inaccurate costumes & hairstyles, overly corny executions...These days it's in to rewrite history in Hollywood.

838755,A2VE83MZF98ITY,B0002KPIR8,"FrKurt Messick ""FrKurt Messick""","[64, 71]","As an historian, I was a bit disappointed with the latest recreation of the lives and wiles of Henry VIII, arguably one of the most important figures in British history.  The nursery rhyme is well known - Henry the Eighth was six times wedded; two he divorced, two beheaded...This production, written by Peter Morgan (known for other television productions such as `The Jury') and directed by Pete Travis (also of `The Jury', also `Other People's Children'), is a period piece that largely rests on one primary theme - that Henry VIII was charged by his father with one task above all others, and that was to secure the succession for another Tudor.  Since this was a world in which (supposedly) a queen could not rule in her own right, this required a male heir to the throne (of course, it would be Henry's own offspring that would change that assumption, for the better, and for ever).Henry's quest to gain a male heir knew no bounds; by the time his obsession had destroyed many lives (not just those of the unfortunate women he married), he was an overweight and overbearing man with not too many years left to live.  His succession of wives is made all the more dramatic by the speed of the unions - between his first divorce from Catherine of Aragon in 1533, he had five more wives in the span of only 10 years, the last one to last until his death in 1547.  The women came into favour and fell out of favour quickly, sometimes due to infidelity and political intrigue, and sometimes due to the quirky whims of Henry.It is this quirkiness that is highlighted in Ray Winstone's performance.  Winstone is not well known to American audiences, but a regular fixture on British television and cinemas.  Henry is presented as a brash, lustful, but often boyishly-innocent figure, vulnerable and wounded by others around him, especially the wives, if they do not live up to his expectations or desires of loving him for himself.  The cast of women portraying the wives is impressive, including the award-winning Helena Bonham Carter as Anne Boleyn, Emilia Fox as Jane Seymour, and Clare Holman as Catherine Parr.  If you think you recognise the voice of the narrator, you probably do - it is that of Shakespearean Derek Jacobi.The sets, costumes, and other atmospheric pieces are well done and appropriate to the context.  But this is an actor's piece, driven by dialogue, and here is falls a little short of fully satisfying.  The characters are a bit too much of caricatures; they overemphasise certain strengths and weaknesses, and do not play as balanced figures (even for the imbalanced people that history tells us they were).  This is meant to draw the tragedy of Henry's life out, and his role as more sinned against than sinning in many parts of the film play.Well worth watching, the viewer who expects an undistorted history lesson will be disappointed.  However, in the `some events have been changed for dramatic purposes' world of acting, it does help to cause some reconsideration here and there of all the events of the time.  History is as much a record as it is interpretation.  This is one.",4,Interpretation in history...,1101168000,"11 23, 2004",2004,3110,"['historian', 'was', 'bit', 'disappointed', 'latest', 'recreation', 'lives', 'wiles', 'Henry', 'VIII', 'arguably', 'one', 'most', 'important', 'figures', 'British', 'history', 'nursery', 'rhyme', 'well', 'known', 'Eighth', 'was', 'six', 'times', 'wedded', 'two', 'divorced', 'two', 'beheaded', 'production', 'written', 'Peter', 'Morgan', 'known', 'other', 'television', 'productions', 'such', 'Jury', 'directed', 'Pete', 'Travis', 'also', 'Jury', 'also', 'Other', 'People', 'Children', 'period', 'piece', 'largely', 'one', 'primary', 'theme', 'Henry', 'VIII', 'was', 'charged', 'father', 'one', 'task', 'others', 'was', 'secure', 'succession', 'Tudor', 'was', 'world', 'supposedly', 'queen', 'could', 'not', 'rule', 'own', 'right', 'required', 'male', 'heir', 'throne', 'course', 'would', 'be', 'Henry', 'own', 'offspring', 'would', 'change', 'assumption', 'better', 'ever', '.Henry', 'quest', 'gain', 'male', 'heir', 'knew', 'bounds', 'time', 'obsession', 'had', 'destroyed', 'many', 'lives', 'not', 'just', 'unfortunate', 'women', 'married', 'was', 'overweight', 'overbearing', 'man', 'not', 'too', 'many', 'years', 'left', 'live', 'succession', 'wives', 'made', 'more', 'dramatic', 'speed', 'unions', 'first', 'divorce', 'Catherine', 'Aragon', '1533', 'had', 'five', 'more', 'wives', 'span', 'only', '10', 'years', 'last', 'one', 'last', 'death', '1547', 'women', 'came', 'favour', 'fell', 'favour', 'quickly', 'sometimes', 'due', 'infidelity', 'political', 'intrigue', 'sometimes', 'due', 'quirky', 'whims', 'Henry.It', 'quirkiness', 'highlighted', 'Ray', 'Winstone', 'performance', 'Winstone', 'not', 'well', 'known', 'American', 'audiences', 'regular', 'fixture', 'British', 'television', 'cinemas', 'Henry', 'presented', 'brash', 'lustful', 'often', 'boyishly-innocent', 'figure', 'vulnerable', 'wounded', 'others', 'especially', 'wives', 'do', 'not', 'live', 'up', 'expectations', 'desires', 'loving', 'cast', 'women', 'portraying', 'wives', 'impressive', 'including', 'award-winning', 'Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'Anne', 'Boleyn', 'Emilia', 'Fox', 'Jane', 'Seymour', 'Clare', 'Holman', 'Catherine', 'Parr', 'think', 'recognise', 'voice', 'narrator', 'probably', 'do', 'Shakespearean', 'Derek', 'Jacobi.The', 'sets', 'costumes', 'other', 'atmospheric', 'pieces', 'are', 'well', 'done', 'appropriate', 'context', 'actor', 'piece', 'driven', 'dialogue', 'here', 'little', 'short', 'fully', 'satisfying', 'characters', 'are', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'caricatures', 'overemphasise', 'certain', 'strengths', 'weaknesses', 'do', 'not', 'play', 'balanced', 'figures', 'even', 'imbalanced', 'people', 'history', 'were', 'meant', 'draw', 'tragedy', 'Henry', 'life', 'role', 'more', 'sinned', 'sinning', 'many', 'parts', 'film', 'play.Well', 'watching', 'viewer', 'who', 'undistorted', 'history', 'lesson', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed', 'However', 'events', 'have', 'been', 'changed', 'dramatic', 'purposes', 'world', 'acting', 'help', 'cause', 'reconsideration', 'here', 'there', 'events', 'time', 'History', 'as', 'much', 'record', 'interpretation', 'one']",N/A

By all contemporary accounts Jane was a  little mouse who was content to let her brothers do the wheeling and dealing. She is too bold in this version.  Helena Bonham Carter looks like she was born to play Queen Anne but she doesn't play the role as tough as she should've. The real Anne Boleyn got the king to abandon his wife and child, give up his religion, and slaughter 1000s of people including friends who had served him faithfully all their lives. She must have been INCREDIBLE. Bonham-Carter wasn't.I liked Winstone a bit better when he was playing old Henry and some of the lout-in-the-pub mannerisms were toned down. His courtship of naughty Catherine Howard was almost touching. I really liked Sean Bean. Sean was the one really  bright spot and I liked the montage of memories at the end of Henry's life and the smug look on Princess Elizabeth's face at his funeral. Although I have to point out that in real life Elizabeth would've hardly dared to look so pleased under the circumstances. To sum up I have to say that unless you really love Ray Winstone and want to watch everything he does skip this version.

838766,A376UHS8GODI8W,B0002KPIR8,Patrick Selitrenny,"[4, 8]","For those of you who know about the BBC Series ""The East Enders"", about blue collar Britons in East London, this will be a clear message.For those of you, who know nothing about this, let me just say, that although ""East Enders"" is a long running series on BBC, and very successful at that in its own right, it is the story of a working class community that shows everyday dramas of common ""Cockney"" people.Although they do not speak too tight, they still preserve their working class accents.And so it is here, in this version of ""Henry VIII"".This is an insult to intelligence and good taste.Not just history-wise, but also to all those working class people in the East End of London, who are in fact, far brighter and intelligent as to fall for this weak attempt to bring History to the ""simple man"".How can you imagine that a man such as Henry VIII, brought up and educated  by the Company of Jesus (a.k.a. Jesuits), both in rhetoric and fine literature, as well as mastering Ancient Greek, Latin and French, could still speak with a working class ""Cockney"" accent?This alone should give you a hint on how bad and how ridiculous the entire movie is.Nor does it help to have Charles Dance (who actually appears and disappears almost immediately) on board, or Helena Bonham-Carter, doing her own bit, as usual, but that has no connection to the true Anne Boleyn (neither physically, nor in personality), or again David Suchet, whose experience as an actor gets totally wasted, by making him too, into a ""Cockney"" Cardinal Wolsey... (better watch him in Poirot).This film takes so many liberties with actual historic fact, such as actual historic feats and details, up to even having all the wrong hair styles, wrong costumes and completely wrong social behaviors of the time.No one bothered to do in-depth biographical researches nor to stick somewhat, to actual court protocol and etiquette of the times.It seems that all the producers, writer(s) and the director wanted, was to slam an MTV generation styled drama onto film, to entertain their own aficionados.Unfortunately they actually managed to go public with this embarrassing product of ignorance, arrogant populism and primitive conception of history.In one word: Revisionist.Revisionism, as we all know, is the specialty of upstarts who never bothered to actually study about what truly came before them, and just love to rewrite history as they please, in order to make it more comfortable to them to justify their otherwise embarrassing and abysmal ignorance pervading the world they have built for themselves, out of accumulating money, but never having spent a minute studying the texts they claim they know, nor having set eyes on actual books of the period.Some reviewers have criticized the 1972 produced movie ""Henry VIII and his Six Wives"" (starring Keith Michell as Henry VIII, reprising his role from the successful BBC series ""The Six Wives of Henry VIII""), as being bad, but let me tell you, that the movie was made for U.S. audiences in mind, who either never got to see the BBC series in the first place, or never got a chance to hear about it (the BBC series is now readily available on DVD in a box set).In fact, the movie has a completely new cast, sporting actors such as Charlotte Rampling and Donald Pleasence (whose daughter was part of the BBC series also).This movie was meant as a sort of a ""compendium"" to the BBC series, and both form a complete and almost accurate (except for some dramatic licenses here and there), history lesson and are far more biographically accurate than this present product.Add also Richard Burton and Genevieve Bujold's ""Anne of the thousand days"" and Paul Scofield and Robert Shaw's appearances in ""A Man for All Seasons"" and you will truly have the complete Henry VIII's tale as it should be told in a movie.This ""Henry VIII"" is pretentious and simplistic to say the least and it is not even ""modern"" as the director tries to defend himself.Being modern can also mean to still have some taste and intelligence left to produce something of value, without treating history as trash.But more important than anything else is that no matter whether you try to reach blue collar workers or white collar ones, a movie-maker ought to have some respect for them.I do not get a great sense of this respect in this movie.They liked it, so we have to like it.No, this is not how it works my dear fellas. You are meant to educate and to bring awareness among people, especially when dealing with history.IF YOU ARE NOT INTERESTED IN THIS, THEN GET YOUR PAWS OFF OF IT!!!!Besides, Ray Winstone is the weakest Henry VIII I have ever seen walk the stage or the screen.I still remember Charles Laughton or Robert Shaw playing him, or even Keith Michell (to me still the definitive Henry), and they all brought majesty into the character.Ray Winstone, probably due to his background as an actor, and to his stocky appearance, but not stature, is constantly forced to yell and yell, but never really comes through as a Monarch.He could at best play King John Plantagenet, but never, ever Henry VIII.He is too weak and looks more like a ""docker"", than a true King.Besides as far as Kings go, they would never shout in public. Their rants and their anger attacks always happen behind closed doors, away from the public eye.I had hoped that this production be as good as its predecessors, or at least as its contemporaries with ""Elizabeth I"" (Helen Mirren) and ""The Virgin Queen"" (Anne-Marie Duff), but no such luck.While I am at it, why did they not cast Robbie Coltrane (""From Hell"" and ""The World is Not Enough"") for the role of Henry VIII?He is a ""Cockney"" as well, but at least HE would have had the stature and I bet he would have played the role with more distinction and fervor than Ray Winstone.The DVD transfer is OK, both in sound, as well as in its image quality, but as said, the movie is not worth a dime or a penny.If you are seriously interested in History and want also acting skills and good writing going hand in hand, then go with the movies and BBC series I have mentioned above.Leave this forgettable and empty-headed MTV-styled product to those who love to drink beer and eat popcorn.They won't mind either way, since their attention span is as long as the length of a commercial break anyway.I am sorry, but in order to produce a History movie, it takes far more talent than this.Certain rules will always apply, but some people don't seem to really care nor do they seem to realize that their careers depend on this simple fact.I cannot recommend this movie to anyone, not even to my dog, who seems to be far more intelligent than some people...",1,East Enders goes Tudorian...,1177372800,"04 24, 2007",2007,6665,"['who', 'know', 'BBC', 'Series', 'East', 'Enders', 'blue',

Hutchinson ""&#34;I have always imag...","[110, 130]","In reading some of these reviews, I wonder if we had seen the same movie.Even if I did not have a degree in history, the terrible inaccuracies and inconsistencies would have been apparent to even a casual historical buff.  It is so bad I don't know where to begin.Henry VIII came across as a blue collar worker who dutifully goes bowling every Saturday night.  There was not even a rudiment of royal aspect to this character; whether or not it was due to the terrible miscasting of the actor (one of many; more about that later) or a clueless director, one can only guess.  If I didn't know the main events and personages of this period, even a scorecard wouldn't have helped me understand what was going on.Major historical events simply flew by without any rhyme, reason or explanation.  At least in some productions, actors are sought who bear some resemblance to the actual person.  In this case, an attempt to do so must have been thrown out the window.  Henry VIII was over 6 ft tall according to his skeleton unearthed in the 1800s.  In this movie almost everybody towers over him, in an age when most men were around 5'6""-5'8"" in height.  And the rest--Wolsey, Cromwell, Cranmer--not one of the actors bore any recognizable resemblance at all to their historical personages, and in most cases were the exact opposites.  And why the crewcuts?The personalities of Henry's wives were many and varied remarkably from one to the other.  This movie, however, took that fact of their differences in individual traits to a ludicrous extreme.  At times, they were downright incorrect.  Jane Seymour was way too overbearing, talkative and meddling.  In reality, Henry had been initially captivated by her because she was quiet and unassuming.  Catherine Howard was a promiscuous young girl, but I doubt she exhibited such sauciness in Henry's very presence.  Didn't anybody involved in this fiasco read a history book?Skinny dipping in Tudor England?????????I cannot finish this review without commenting on the total lack of  knowledge of the time period.  Didn't anyone know that women, especially those of the upper class, NEVER appeared in public without the sometimes elaborate headresses of the period?  The only exception would be when a woman was crowned; she would ride to her coronation with her hair loose.  Otherwise, women generally hid their tresses under headpieces and scarves.  I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw the young Lady Mary in public without any head covering; likewise Catherine Howard.What makes this especially disappointing is that usually the British are sticklers for historical accuracy.  Can someone tell me what happened with this movie?  Are they no longer teaching English History in the schools?This sad movie is nothing but an elaborate soap opera set in Tudor England and altering the principles to such a degree that one had to guess whom they were portraying.If you know very little about history, please do not use this movie as a starting point in your education.  As for those of us who have made an intense study of Tudor England--this film isn't even good enough for a laugh.  History massacred!

It's unbeatable with well drawn characters and superb acting. You really can't write a critique of this newer version without comparison to the 70's version. This version of Henry VIII isn't as gory as depicted by some reviewers e.g., Boleyn's bloody head held high for onlookers to see, some sword fights, a joust and the leader of the catholic insurrection bloodied topsy turvey. Who wants to watch gore anyway (yeah right). We want at least some semblance of historical accuracy and fine performances. Ray Winstone as Henry VIII has less of a cockney accent in the film than he does in the special interview section on the DVD. He did tone it down considerably so I have no argument with that. His Henry though is a narcissistic egomaniac, psychotic in his quest to keep his promise to his father, a promise that provided for a male heir. Today, he would be taken kicking and screaming from the castle, institutionalized and probably for the remainder of his life. Trumped up charges against Anne Boleyn led her to the axe, a vile Henry thrusting another wife to the floor while she was pregnant therefore resulting in her demise, another wife portrayed as a slut and adulteress leading her to the axeman etc. The man had no mercy for others, so in the end when he's near death you have no sympathy for him. Most importantly, there were no contradictions in Henry's character that made the viewer think about how a man of such intelligence and often gentleness could be so cruel, murder two wives and try and have history see his spanish queen as a slut and their children bastards. The 70's version provided wonderfully portrayed characters who even when you detested them you also felt some kind of pain for, especially Henry portrayed magnificently by Keith Mitchell. I would also have liked to have seen more script for Catherine of Aragon. I think she was really the most fascinating queen of them all and with a will of iron. One gets the feeling that if she had been sent to the axe, she wouldn't have publicly praised Henry as all the others did before the axe ended their lives. This wasn't even fun to watch. The 70's version at least had some fine areas of humor. Henry too was shown in that production as an intelligent man curious about the world about him. There's no such Henry in this newer version. As for Helena Bonham Carter as Anne Boleyn, costumed in some kind oF frizzy material either wrapped around her head or hanging off of one side of her head, reminded me more of Miss Faversham than the allegedly seductive Anne. Her costumes were dreadful. In fact, often Henry's costumes looked made on the cheap. Bonham-Carter was miscast. Whether true or not, we've come to think of Anne Boleyn, because of her reputation as ""The Great Whore"", more than just attractive but with that special quality a woman exudes that makes her appear as beautiful even if she's plain. Bonham-Carter, no matter how you dress her up is always plain and her costumes dominate her, not the other way around. England was fortunate that Henry never had a male heir who lived long enough to rule. If you can get a copy of this DVD at the library, get it.

If you know the history of the Tudor period, this program really ain't it - except in its sweeping overview of history.What I thought was fascinating was that these people seemed more 'real' to me than in the other programs I've seen. Though it is infinitely better in terms of reporting history, Keith Michell's The Six Wives of Henry VIII seems antiseptic to me, like there's really nothing at stake.While I agree with the others that Henry wasn't the kind of man who would personally treat his wives cruelly (raping, throwing them to the ground), this is the first rendition of him where I saw him as charismatic, a larger-than-life figure. I don't care that the actor playing him isn't the right height...... I don't care that the wives don't have the right color hair. For the most part (Anne of Cleves the exception, she certainly wasn't on-screen for very long), the wives seemed more flesh and blood here than elsewhere. For once, I could see what Henry must have seen in Anne Boleyn and Catherine Howard. Even if her death scene was woefully written (Catherine didn't throw a tantrum before being beheaded), this actress playing her was both beautiful and conveyed a sexual knowledge far beyond her years.The historical accuracy problems have been well documented - and are endless.

838772,A2Y55P7L3NFZ2F,B0002KPIR8,"T. Thompson ""Clydesight Productions""","[0, 0]","I really enjoyed this re-telling of Henry VIII. The production values were excellent, the acting excellent, the dialog engaging, and it offered a slightly different take on Henry as a character than other ""Tudor Stories"".However, there were some scenes and dialog that seemed to be lifted from other Tudor productions, most notably Catherine of Aragon's speech to Anne Boleyn when she was going to the divorce court, and her address to the English court where she demands to be tried only by the Pope. It seemed very familiar and I was wondering, was it taken from an historical reference? Was it lifted from a movie (""The Other Boleyn Girl"", ""Anne of 1,000 Days"")?And that led to me to be curious about the accuracy of other parts of the story. What happened to Thomas Moore in this one (He was historically an adviser to Henry, yet he's not in the movie)?It is important to keep in mind that there are MANY ""Tudor Stories"" available, and each has a different take on Henry, much as ""Elizabeth Epics"" have different takes on her.And that adds another curiosity - what is is about this monarch that makes him such a good subject for a drama - over and over again?""Long live the King"" really means something when it comes to Henry VIII because hundreds of years after his reign, we're still trying to figure him out, and he makes wonderful soap opera material! It's more than the 6 wives, it's Henry himself who fascinates us. How could he have been who he was and did the things he did? He is a conundrum and a mass of conflicts. I guess we like that in our historical monarchs.This movie (well, TV drama) is very well done because of the take they use for the character of Henry.We all know about (and have seen) the absolute monarch angle (i.e. ""The Tudors"", which admittedly came AFTER this movie), we all know the lustful sexual athlete angle (""Anne of 1,000 Days"", with brilliant performances all round, especially by Richard Burton), we all know the more historically precise formal historical angle (""Henry VIII and his Six Wives"").But in this version, we see Henry as a much more down-to-earth monarch, with less emphasis on court formality and more emphasis on a ""super athlete"" type of character, with matching dialog and speech.History tells us that he was never trained to be a king; he was destined for the church and received much religious training, but little political or diplomatic training. History tells us that he adored sport of all kinds and liked the ""manly arts"", archery, hunting, horseback riding. History tells us that physically, he stood head-and-shoulders above his contemporaries, like a huge football star of today, with an energy to match. This movie seems to follow the latter characteristics of Henry's personality so we see him as a ""rough-and-tumble"" monarch who is easily misled by ambitious advisers.History may have been dictated by the Tudors themselves, so we have to consider it carefully. And it is important before criticizing the film's historical accuracy to remember that historical records account for a small fraction of a person's entire life. It cannot record in detail the intimate details of a man's life. The dramatists (from Shakespeare on) must fill in those details with their imaginations, and there in lies the ""meat"" of the drama.So, the question is, does this movie meet dramatic needs? Does it entertain? Does it leave one thinking and contemplating Henry and those around him -- as characters, as people?I'd say yes, each version of Henry's life does this in its own unique way. And this movie, coming as it does after a long line of ""Henry films"" successfully meets the challenge of using well known material and engaging the audience in it yet again.The script, the production itself, the costumes, the dialog all work together to this end. It is well directed and much of the credit goes to the actors because they make us believe all the other stuff.The most notable performances are:Ray Winstone as Henry, looks the part and is an engaging actor who is convincing and believable. He carries the show. His Henry is a rough and tumble, practical sort of guy who definitely gets more and more unhinged as time goes on. He is suitably vulnerable and human while also being an absolute monarch and dictator. He makes Henry fascinating and terrifying, a hero at times, a villain at others. At times you love him, at times you hate him, and most of all, you can't forget him.Helena Bonham Carter is excellent as Anne Boleyn, tough, cunning, conniving and tragic in the end. She's always a delight. (I'm a fan of her work, so I admit a certain prejudice). Of all the wives in this production, she is the most memorable and I believe she gets the most air time.Danny Webb delivers a fine performance as Thomas Cromwell. He epitomizes the word, ""toady"", craftily sneaking around Henry for his own ambitions and is suitably terrified when he falls out of favor. His execution scene is particularly horrid and tragic.David Suchet gives us a rather subdued Cardinal Wolsey compared to other portrayals, but he's sufficiently cold and calculating.The production values of the film are very high, and there is actually less blood and gore (two vivid executions and a torture scene, the rest is glossed over) than I would expect from a cable channel TV movie. There are a few explicit sex scenes and some nudity. These didn't bother me much. After all Henry was a lusty man. They showed a certain restraint (more so than the later ""The Tudors"") and in 2003, showing a sex scene with any restraint on TV is something of an accomplishment!In the end, was this an entertaining movie and would I watch it again? Well, though I know the Tudor story from so many tellings, I say YES to both. I found the production to be engaging and had a fast enough pace to keep me with it, even though I knew perfectly well how things would turn out for all the characters.The only thing lacking, in this and other Tudor productions is the unanswerable question... What is it about Henry (and Elizabeth I, for that matter) that makes him so darn fascinating?Is it his mixture of vices and virtues? Is it his ""larger than life"" persona? Or is it simply the sense of suspense and danger about him? When you were in his favor, his generosity was amazing. When you were not, his vengeance was appalling.History tells us that Henry brought stability and relative peace (in spite of his wars to regain France) to the country. It tells us that the arts flourished during his reign, that there was a great deal of building, Universities got started, and the people loved him.It seems the only people at risk were the one's who tried to use him or to cross him.With any ruler, that's a dangerous game. But with Henry, it's a source of endless entertainment!",5,Excellent Production But Curious???,1340668800,"06 26, 2012",2012,6783,"['really', 'enjoyed', 're-telling', 'Henry', 'VIII', 'production',

Give Tony Soprano a cockney accent, died red hair, and you have Ray Winstone. I have to admit I thought about James Gandolfini througout the entire time watching this.  I am truly disgusted with the barrage of historical inaccuracies in historical period films, some I can tolerate, but this was not one of them.  The miscasting of Ray Winstone was perhaps the largest blunder - he was short, could not provide any sort of ""majestical dignity"", and did not for one minute convince me of Henry VIII.  The wives did not carry the movie either.  Helena Bonham Carter was pregnant during the filming, and her large girth was evident and poorly hidden.  It was distracting when you are picturing a petite attractive woman, and Helena Bonham Carter has a larger waistline than Henry!! I cringed when they had Anne Boleyn say goodbye to  the three year old Elizabeth in the tower, that was the most gut wrenching inaccuracy of many.  The only part I enjoyed was the last minute or so when the narrator, stating that Henry VIII, despite his quest for a male heir, did have a glorious heir in the form of a daughter, Elizabeth I.",1,Tony Soprano as Henry VIII????,1100908800,"11 20, 2004",2004,1251,"['agree', 'many', 'reviewers', 'here', 'One', 'even', 'mentioned', 'Tony', 'Soprano', 'inspiration', 'Ray', 'Winstone', 'horrid', 'performance', 'Give', 'Tony', 'Soprano', 'cockney', 'accent', 'died', 'red', 'hair', 'have', 'Ray', 'Winstone', 'have', 'admit', 'thought', 'about', 'James', 'Gandolfini', 'entire', 'time', 'watching', 'am', 'truly', 'disgusted', 'barrage', 'historical', 'inaccuracies', 'historical', 'period', 'films', 'can', 'tolerate', 'was', 'not', 'one', 'miscasting', 'Ray', 'Winstone', 'was', 'perhaps', 'largest', 'blunder', 'was', 'short', 'could', 'not', 'provide', 'sort', 'majestical', 'dignity', 'did', 'not', 'one', 'minute', 'convince', 'Henry', 'VIII', 'wives', 'did', 'not', 'carry', 'movie', 'Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'was', 'pregnant', 'filming', 'large', 'girth', 'was', 'evident', 'poorly', 'hidden', 'was', 'distracting', 'when', 'are', 'picturing', 'petite', 'attractive', 'woman', 'Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'larger', 'waistline', 'Henry', 'cringed', 'when', 'had', 'Anne', 'Boleyn', 'say', 'goodbye', 'three', 'year', 'old', 'Elizabeth', 'tower', 'was', 'most', 'gut', 'wrenching', 'inaccuracy', 'many', 'only', 'part', 'enjoyed', 'was', 'last', 'minute', 'so', 'when', 'narrator', 'stating', 'Henry', 'VIII', 'quest', 'male', 'heir', 'did', 'have', 'glorious', 'heir', 'form', 'daughter', 'Elizabeth']",N/A
838774,A14HMP62A37RVX,B0002KPIR8,Viewer,"[23, 27]","I was looking forward to this movie, as I love anything to do with the Tudors, and find the time period fascinating, as well as the bizarre monarchy!  However, this movie leaves everything lacking.  Let's start with the music.  Lovely, but far too familiar.  They stole it from Gladiator!  I was wondering why I could anticipate the next note! Also some music and scenes were stolen from the movie Elizabeth.  Truly, no need for this.  A little original creativity, please!  Helena Bonham Carter is usually quite good in her roles, but she showed no emotion, and her perfomance is dull and flat compared to Anne in ""Anne of the Thousand Days.""  She never comes off as convincing, nor powerful, as the real Anne Boleyn was.  Henry seemed weak, as well, and the whole story is a Reader's Digest version, which, unless you are familiar with Tudor history, makes it very difficult for a viewer to truly understand the politics between Church and State, in those days, and how the chaos influenced life at Court and beyond.  I had thought I would purchase this, but won't bother, afterall, which is too bad.  For movies, stick to Anne of the Thousand Days, Lady Jane, and Elizabeth.  For accurate history, get David Starkey's The Six Wives of Henry VIII DVD, which will be time well spent.
