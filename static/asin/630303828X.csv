It tells a parallel story of two loves, one in the present and one in the past (several years before ""Possession"").  The gradual revelation of the past love story is handled more deftly in the movie than in the book.  However, the two scenes early in the movie in which Michael's behavior borders on violence are not by the book: in the book he is aggressive but far from violent.  Still, the quality and effectiveness of this movie earn it a five-star rating.The surprise ending is completely and well prepared for, so there are no grounds for objecting to it.  In fact, it would be incredible if what is revealed were not so, given what has happened.Sharon Stone gives the performance of her career in this movie, three years before she became a femme fatale and a superstar in Basic Instinct.  The late Shakespearean actor Paul Daneman gives an incredibly effective performance as Lord Bredon.The picture quality is good in this DVD and the sound quality is acceptable.

351854,A35PEO9ANAULIZ,630303828X,"Sharon D. Felker ""Movie Lady""","[0, 1]","I will preface this by telling you I am not a Sharon Stone fan. However her role in Tears In the Rain, made in 1988 four years before she starred in Basic Instinct, definitely impressed me with her acting abilities. Her younger, softer, almost girl-next-door wholesomeness enchants the viewer from the beginning. Casey Cantrell (Sharon Stone) has been left instructions after her mother's death to hand deliver a letter to Lord Richard Bredon (the late Shakespearean actor Paul Daneman) in the United Kingdom. Upon her arrival a twist of fate throws Casey into the arms of Lord Bredon's son Michael (Christopher Cazenove).While the story itself is outstanding and the acting is great, this particular version is absolutely terrible. The DVD is transfer poorly done, the color is inferior at best, the sound quality is deplorable, the picture is grainy and fuzzy. Legacy Entertainment should be ashamed to have their name on it. Take my advice and buy the 2006 version re-released by Trinity Entertainment (far better quality).Take a dashing hero, a beautiful heroine, and an evil influence (in the form of Lady Emily played quite well by Anna Massey) wrap them in mystery and intrigue and what do you have... the makings of a great romantic fairytale. As the story unfolds you realize that there are actually two love stories here, one in the past and the one in the present. We are treated to a veritable feast of romance, drama, and suspense. As you ride along on this rollercoaster ride of emotions you are swept along by the love Casey and Michael share. I was enthralled in this tale of great and undying love. I found that it took my breath away and kept me guessing at every turn, right up to the surprise ending.Sharon Stone and this predominately British cast deliver the kind of romantic storyline that women crave- and they do it quite well. And men could take a few lessons from the ever romantic Michael.No special effects or special features here, just a great story that is well done. Based on the novel written by Pamela Wallace and adapted by Freda Kelsall and directed by Don Sharp.
