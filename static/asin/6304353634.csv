416159,A23LKR4GASF59Y,6304353634,"5/0 ""Outdoors USA""","[80, 88]","The Ghost and the Darkness is about the two maneating lions that terrorized the crew building a bridge at a desolate, nowhere place called Tsavo, Africa, circa 1890s, a place that had long been known as an area of active maneating lions. The original account written by Col. John H. Patterson, the engineer responsible for building the bridge and killing the lions (and played superbly by Val Kylmer), is one of the greatest Classics of African Hunting Literature ever written and known very well by legions of non-Bambi outdoor enthusiasts around the world. Subsequent accounts, the best of which is the well-researched wrtiing of 20th Century African hunter Peter Hathaway Capstick in his ""Death in the Silent Places"" and ""The Maneaters of Tsavo"" have become nearly as popular.The movie does take some liberties with events but most of the key scenes in the movie actually happened though perhaps in a bit different context. For example, the movie has the den of the maneaters being found prior to the lions' deaths but it was actually found some weeks afterward. But that wasn't the point in 1898. The cave actually contained (as in the movie) the skeletal remains of hundreds of human victims, so many, in fact, the probability is that den had been used by maneaters for centuries. Not too surprising the crews and locals felt Tsavo was a place of Evil. Adding credibility to the longevity of use theory is the fact that four other maneaters who ran up a score of 50 souls in that same area were killed in a single day by hunter Robert Foran - in 1947. But wait. Professional hunter John Kingsley-Heath killed another maneater there too - in 1965. But wait - Peter Capstick's boss was killed and eaten not too far from Tsavo on Labor Day 1974. That's right - 1974. Where were YOU in 1974?The African and Indian cultures of the 1890s weren't, and aren't, the United States. The liklihood these two lions would quickly be seen as ""more than just lions"", as some unstoppable Evil is more like a guarantee. The abject Terror of 2000-3000 African and Indian laborers was a real as Death itself. That Terror is amply displayed in the movie, but is still understated.The movie's lions, even with their ominous role as ""more than lions"", act very much like real maneaters did, and do. And when they do it in a joust with unarmed humans, they usually win, bigtime, and assorted gore and human body parts are a consistant by-product of such festivities. I've never never read anything at all about a famous lioneater.The movie's filming and effects are very good. Michael Douglas, as the ficticious hunter Remington, supports Kylmer well, and with a well-done, darkly amusing style. The ""shock"" scenes are ""SHOCK"" scenes, especially one in particular. You will FEEL your blood pressure drop to zero only to be red-lining again in a flash. You WILL hold your breath and you may regain it. Seriously, allowing a young child to watch this is probably not the best of ideas, and not because of the gore but because many of the scenes of the primal, nightmarish Horror these maneating lions deliver take place after dark and ""after dark"" is already an ""iffy"" proposition for many kids without the fangs of Hades clashing in their minds.

However, in this case I am a real fan of this film and thought I would leave review anyway.  Initially I did not want to see this film because I had read reviews that said this film was just a standard Hollywood film that injected white males into Africa to save the locals from danger.  I'm glad I finally ignored these reviews and viewed this film.  While Kilmer and Douglas (especially Douglas who breaks from his victimized male roles) provide fine acting I enjoy this film for it's basic but intriguing story line, it's beautiful scenery and the background music.  I have never been to Africa and have never had a great desire to visit.  However, this film shows a beautiful land and the music provides the right feel and now I find myself hoping to one day vist and tour the land.I do not know too many people who have seen this movie but those who have agree with me that this is movie that feels real. For those like myself who are unfamiliar with this story they will be drawn to the story line and unlike some films will not be sure that they can predict the ending.  A good family movie as long as the kids are probably 8 or older.  Some kids may be frightened by the lions but there is no real bad language or gore that may offend some viewers.

The lions would sneak into the construction camp at night to snatch a man and then devour him. Two hunters eventually eliminated this threat after many trials. The lions seemed so calculating and powerful that many believed them to be demons in the form of a lion. After being killed, the remains ended up in the Field Museum in Chicago.The lions of Tsavo in southern Kenya are known as man-eaters; the males are often maneless. This area was part of a slave-trading road; weak or sick slaves were killed and left for the animals. [What were they thinking?] Colonel John H. Patterson was the engineer in charge, and had hunted tigers in India. His book &quot;The Man-Eaters of Tsavo&quot; is available; you can compare the history to this dramatization.This film won't tell you that the man-eating lions of Tsavo continue to take prey to this day.

A person can scroll through scores/pages of reviews without reading a single sentence about the quality of the DVD. If you want to review or discuss a film, go to IMDB.

In terms of Hollywood, it's fairly accurate. The film itself, as entertainment, is great (it seems some people are analyzing it as if it were a documentary???). I'm a fan of both Douglas and Kilmer; they're fine here, but they've definitely done better work elsewhere. The plot moves along nicely and creates some definite tension and suspense. Additionally, the photography is beautiful and the soundtrack is great, too.Now the bad news: the DVD sucks. Period. And I'm not even complaining about the lack of extras here. The transfer is absolutely criminal, and those responsible for it should never work on another DVD project ever again. The print is clear and solid, but the aspect ratio is not correct AT ALL.

416173,AMICVV9N2U2R4,6304353634,Atli Hafsteinsson,"[1, 1]","Two male lions kill lots of people. Sounds cool, and it bloody well is. The Ghost and the Darkness is, on all accounts, a thrilling experience to sit through. It's far from being a perfect film, and yet it's a film that's somehow impossible to hate, or even dislike. There's lots of animal attack galore to be found here, yet it never quite overrides the overall visual appeal of it all.In 1898, Irish Colonel John Patterson is sent to the river Tsavo, Africa, to construct a railroad bridge - forcing him to leave his pregnant wife behind in London. Upon arriving in Africa, Patterson learns of a rampant lion on the loose. He quickly manages to kill it, raising the morale of the workers. This, however, proves to be entirely deceptive. Soon after, two male lions start to prey on the workers - chillingly, they appear to kill for sport rather than food. All efforts to stop them are in vain until hunter Charles Remington arrives to help Patterson rid Tsavo, and the workers, of this threat. But the lions (called the Ghost and the Darkness by the workers) are smart, and disposing of them won't be easy even with Remington in league.This premise is based on a real-life account by John Patterson, and it was practically destined for a movie adaptation. While it is quite true that the movie differentiates on Patterson's account in many ways (Remington is entirely fictional), it's all for the benefit of this film. The actual lions were maneless, yet for the sake of the movie's aesthetics, the fully-maned lions (Bongo and Caesar) strike a more impressive image. The easiness with which the lions kill is also a tad exaggerated, but then, again, the film is all the more suspenseful for it. A big plus is that the cinematography of this movie is fantastic. One of the scenes in particular - where we first truly see one of the lions kill and eat a worker before our very eyes - is fabulously staged and filmed. In fact, it's one of those movie moments that have edged themselves permanently into my memory - the most artistic, even beautiful piece of animal gore filmmaking you could find (nothing too queasy). The movie deservedly won an Oscar for Best Sound Editing (the lions's growls, roars and chomps send shivers down my spine for one), and the African-flavoured score by Jerry Goldsmith is wonderful.While it may not be as memorable as the aforementioned, the acting is more than acceptable. John Patterson may be Val Kilmer's most underrated and misunderstood performance; he delivers the role with an understatement that fits the brooding nature of the character. His very subtle Irish accent, possibly heavily affected by a long servitude of Britain, is another trait he gets across very well. Remington is endlessly entertaining and the two characters work together like magic. John Kani and Brian McCardie are both solid as faithful co-leader Samuel and missionary Angus Starling. Emily Mortimer's Helena Patterson cannot be overlooked, either; her few scenes are enough to demonstrate the strong relationship between her husband and her.If there is one thing I can criticise, it's the editing. There are moments when the staging reveals itself to be flawed, in particular the hospital attack scene. The cutting disrupts the continuity and flow of the scene rather than supports it - sometimes you can even plainly see that those are animatronic lions. Mostly, however, it's real lions in all their glory.This movie isn't for everyone. Despite the savageness, the lions and their attacks are almost sophisticated to behold, and it's perhaps this that's the most thrilling aspect of the film. There are no special features to be found on this DVD, but then this movie is interesting enough as it is (though I do wish they would have at least included the cut scene where Patterson gets up close to one of the lions - a scene which Michael Douglas admits was one of the best scenes). Besides, not every piece of filmmaking has to be Lawrence of Arabia, so to speak. Some movies are at their best just being 'cool', as well as believable. The Ghost and the Darkness is, on all accounts, a 'cool' film - and there's nothing wrong with that. This is the best enactment of lion attacks you could find in a movie, and I myself have never seen more aesthetic filmwork on lions.

Wilkins ""star gazer""","[0, 0]","While certain liberties were taken with the storyline there was enough left to give us a gist of the reality, and even then, it would have been hard to believe. The gist is,Col. John Patterson was sent to Africa in 1898 to build a bridge in a place called Tsavo. While he was there, he was suddenly confronted by the problems of the railroad but discovered a real threat from the local wildlife. While he keeps trying to convince himself that they are ""just lions"" these lions show an uncanny wit and capacity to outwit Patterson's every effort to trap and kill them as the two lions literally decimate his workforce with frightening efficiency, even striking in daylight to pick off prey. The truth is, these lions have actually killed at least 130 people between them, most from his workforce. Remington appears after being summoned by Beaumont and assists with the first lion. While this part is fiction it doesn't distract from the storyline at all, but adds to the pathos when he becomes a victim of the surviving lion.By this time John is at wits end, but manages to sort everything out at the last.The lions were real. They do exist in the Field Museum in Chicago. They have a true history of blood behind them, and while some of the tale was exaggerated it did not detract at all from the truth.Tsavo was indeed well named as a place of slaughter as it was once a native battleground and then two man-eaters hunting grounds. The real lions of Tsavo didn't have any manes, because the area is mostly thorn brush, but after seeing a maniacal lion coming at you in the dark, a mane-or lack of one would be the last thing anyone would notice.If anyone deserves an oscar for performance, it should go to the lions.

While they did kill quite a few people in real life, the lions in the movie behaved nothing like real lions.  And the people?  They also don't behave very much like real people; there's no way someone gets dragged out of their tent by the leg in the middle of the night without making a sound.  And three hunters armed with rifles who are completely incapable of hitting a trapped lion just a few feet away because they are terrified?  Whatever.

416189,A34XOL0421NCVP,6304353634,"Christopher Cline ""Film Lover""","[2, 2]","I have always liked ""The Ghost and the Darkness"", ever since I first saw it in the theater. For me, it harkens back to the old black & white ""African Safari"" films of the 30's and 40's, but with better acting, story and realism.I love wildlife, so I could never watch a movie where wild animals are killed by hunters just out for something to take back home and stuff! This story isn't about that, its about human survival against two predators who were known to have killed 135 human rail-workers just for the pleasure (we know that Lions will kill baboons just because they hate baboons, so to me, this is believable) of it in 1898.I think Val Kilmer is one of the most underrated actors of his generation. He does a great job portraying a real life Victorian era Irish engineer, John Henry Patterson, believable brogue and all, and creates a character you like and can relate to. Even Michael Douglas' self-indulgent creation of the fictional character ""Charles Remington"", whom Douglas created for himself (Douglas was also Executive Producer on the film) is a great addition to the story and is well portrayed by Douglas. The friendship that develops between Patterson (Kilmer) and Remington (Douglas) is believable and when Remington becomes the lions next victim, he is truly missed. The supporting cast is wonderful, even if many of them don't survive to the films climactic end.One of the standout elements of The Ghost and the Darkness was the score composed for it by, the now late, Jerry Goldsmith. Jerry Goldsmith always had a penchant for scoring for African/Desert themed films and this score is no exception. It is powerful, moving, frightening and lends the exact right flavor to the film and compliments its visuals perfectly. I usually don't get too weepy when watching films, but when Goldsmith plays his sweet, sweeping ""resolution"" theme when Patterson sees his wife at the Tsavo train station and meets his newborn son for the first time at the conclusion of the film, I can't help but get choked up by the scene! The scene of Patterson's burning of the fields after Remington is killed is powerfully accentuated by Goldsmith's music!As mentioned in the film, the two actual male Lions who were the man-eaters in the real event are on display at the Field Museum in Chicago. I have visited the museum and saw the two lions myself. Although the lions are maneless, which is a trait of Tsavo lions (they were portrayed in the film as HAVING manes), they are HUGE and one can see the power and ferocity that was there once.The film itself is HIGHLY underrated and tends to get maligned, mostly by people who admit that they never actually sat down and watched the film from beginning to end. I think this low opinion of the film is completely unjustified, because, even IF you don't like the film's subject matter, this incident REALLY occurred, the acting is wonderful, the cinematography is beautiful, the locations are great, the music is magnificent and the story is gripping and moving.Technically, the DVD is not the best quality transfer that it could have been and I hope they re-release it on DVD and Blu-Ray someday soon with a higher resolution transfer.

""Daniel""","[0, 0]","William Goldman, the screenwriter of THE GHOST AND THE DARKNESS is a novelist who also writes for Hollywood for more than 40 years now. His most known original screenplays are those ofButch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (Special Edition),Marathon ManandMaverick. When you see the name of William Goldman on the list of credits of a film, you know for sure that there will be more in the movie than meets the eye.Now, when I read here reviews that destroy the GHOST AND THE DARKNESS by pointing out that the lions in the film don't act like real lions, I feel sad and sorry for these reviewers. It's like hating a Picasso painting because the faces of its characters are misshappen. The characters or events pictured in a fiction movie have a life of their own that should convey the artistic vision of the director or the screenwriter. If the lions don't act like in a documentary film, it's simply because the authors of the film wanted them to be larger than life.THE GHOST AND THE DARKNESS is one of the best adventure movies I've seen in a long time. Lavishly photographed by the multi-awarded Vilmos Zsigmond, with an effective musical score by Jerry Goldsmith, the film shows the duel that opposes two highly symbolic couples. This duel quickly overshadows the subplots such as the difficulties to build a bridge in the African savanna or to maintain order in a multiethnic team. Two solitary lions, without any links with a herd, fight two men, away from their family or, for Charles Remington, without any family at all. And now you can try to figure out what the movie is really about : is it a film about the couple civilization/nature or a film dealing with some of our most ancestral fears ? or is it even about something else ? If a film can raise such questions, it surely deserves a little consideration.A DVD for your library.",5,BEFORE  DAKTARI,1176422400,"04 13, 2007",2007,1841,"['William', 'Goldman', 'screenwriter', 'THE', 'GHOST', 'AND', 'THE', 'DARKNESS', 'novelist', 'who', 'also', 'Hollywood', 'more', '40', 'years', 'now', 'most', 'known', 'original', 'screenplays', 'are', 'ofButch', 'Cassidy', 'Sundance', 'Kid', 'Special', 'Edition', 'Marathon', 'ManandMaverick', 'When', 'see', 'name', 'William', 'Goldman', 'list', 'credits', 'film', 'know', 'sure', 'will', 'be', 'more', 'movie', 'eye.Now', 'when', 'read', 'here', 'GHOST', 'THE', 'DARKNESS', 'pointing', 'out', 'lions', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'act', 'real', 'lions', 'feel', 'sad', 'sorry', 'reviewers', 'hating', 'Picasso', 'painting', 'characters', 'are', 'misshappen', 'characters', 'events', 'pictured', 'fiction', 'movie', 'have', 'life', 'own', 'should', 'convey', 'artistic', 'vision', 'director', 'screenwriter', 'lions', 'do', ""n't"", 'act', 'documentary', 'film', 'simply', 'authors', 'film', 'wanted', 'be', 'larger', 'life.THE', 'GHOST', 'THE', 'DARKNESS', 'one', 'best', 'adventure', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'long', 'time', 'Lavishly', 'photographed', 'multi-awarded', 'Vilmos', 'Zsigmond', 'effective', 'musical', 'score', 'Jerry', 'Goldsmith', 'film', 'duel', 'two', 'highly', 'symbolic', 'couples', 'duel', 'quickly', 'subplots', 'such', 'difficulties', 'build', 'bridge', 'African', 'savanna', 'maintain', 'order', 'multiethnic', 'team', 'Two', 'solitary', 'lions', 'links', 'herd', 'fight', 'two', 'men', 'away', 'family', 'Charles', 'Remington', 'family', 'now', 'can', 'try', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'movie', 'really', 'film', 'couple', 'civilization/nature', 'film', 'dealing', 'most', 'ancestral', 'fears', 'even', 'something', 'else', 'film', 'can', 'raise', 'such', 'questions', 'surely', 'little', 'consideration.A', 'DVD', 'library']",The Ghost and the Darkness VHS

416199,A23GFTVIETX7DS,6304353634,Debbie Lee Wesselmann,"[25, 63]","This African adventure based on a real account pumps the adrenalin in true Hollywood style - and that's not necessarily a good thing.  Val Kilmer plays engineer John Patterson, who has always been able to overcome all obstacles through sheer will and hard work, until, that is, he gets sent to Africa to build a bridge.  In Africa, the country of his dreams, John's work is sabotaged not by man but by beast.  Two man-eating lions are mauling and dragging off workers not only in their sleep but eventually in broad daylight, completely against the nature of their species.  They kill not for food but for &quot;sport.&quot;  Charles Remington (Michael Douglas), an experienced hunter, is called in to help restore calm by killing the lions.This might have been an exciting story if the filmmakers had not chosen to ratchet up the terror by making these lions seem supernaturally invincible.  The lions are imbued with so much (supposedly scary) intelligence that they trick Remington and Patterson more than once so they can make their kills. They become evil instead of unpredictable.  As the film progresses,  everything gets even more unbelievably hokey as the actors strap on their machismo. Still, the scenes with the lions are chair-grabbing tense; it's only after the scenes have ended that the viewer is likely to see how ridiculous it all is.The best part of this film comes before the lions appear, when Patterson is suffering from the pride we know he'll lose, and as the camera pans over the African savannah.  But most viewers aren't watching this film for its character development and cinematography.  If only the suspense had not been artificially heightened, this could have been a solid thriller.This is a decent escapist movie with not much to offer on second viewing.

As many people have said, the scenery and music were great, and the sound (esp the lions) terrifyingly good.The portrayal of what happened was a BIT silly, I admit (like Jaws or Jurassic Park, with lions...beast as relentless hunter of humans for no apparent reason) but if that's what really happened, then so be it.  Still, the lions with blood around their mouths half the time...come on, it was like watching Silence of the Lambs in lion form. I'm sure lions clean up.  They're cats! Cats are tidy.Also, Val Kilmer's accent came and went (annoying) and NOBODY's teeth were that white back then.  I thought Michael Douglas's brief appearance was good.  Not Oscar winning, but good! He IS, after all, an Oscar winner in the past. Like another reviewer said, ""Michael Dounglas is...Michael Douglas).I thought Val Kilmer was well cast (and for the ladies, became more rugged and attractive looking as the movie went on). I mean, HE was no Oscar winner but why the Razzie? He wasn't that bad!There was suspense, and things that were just as horrifying as in any...horror movie. Again, beast as ""serial killer"" was a little silly but like I said, apparently that is pretty much what happened.The film was not too long, and was easy to understand.

Set in 1898, John Henry Patterson (Kilmer) has been chosen to finish the Uganda Railway in order to transport imports and exports between Kenya and Uganda. Along with his supervisors Starling (McCardie) and Samuel (Kani), it all runs pretty smoothly despite some bitter conflicts between Indians and Africans. But everything is plagued by a standstill as two mean-eating lions attack every single man that they prey on. Not even with the assistance of the famous hunter Charles Remmington (Douglas) can they manage to stop these lions from killing over a hundred men.This isn't really historically accurate: Remmington is a completely fictional character. But hey, it's a great film nonetheless. It has magnificent cinematography, a memorable film score, and some astonishing editing involving man vs. beast. Douglas, Kani, McCardie, and Bernard Hill as Doctor Hawthorne give fine performances. Kilmer, however, doesn't seem to even try in some scenes. His ""Irish accent"" is sometimes absent, and his acting overall is almost laughable. But that's only one of the few flaws found in this film.

Williams ""gareth37""","[0, 0]","March-December 1898 Tsavo, Kenya: during the building of the Uganda-Mombasa Railway, two man-eater lions terrorized the construction camp.  According to Colonel John Henry Patterson these two lions killed 135 men from March to December.  These lions were eventually killed on December 9 and 29th.  In 1907 he published his account in The Man-Eaters of Tsavo.The Ghost and the Darkness, the names for these two fearless lions, is a 1996 film starring Michael Douglas as the great white hunter Charles Remington and Val Kilmer as Colonel John Henry Patterson whose mission was to build the bridge at all costs.  When you toss in great African scenery and Jerry Goldsmith's music you have a great adventure film loosely based on The Man-Eaters of Tsavo.The lions are presented as predators that are meticulous and deadly as they hunt their prey among the terrified construction workers.  The scenes where they attack are gruesome. These lions are not afraid of anything.As the construction camp is abandoned by the international array of workers, Remington and Patterson track the lions and discover their lair in a cave.  What they find in the cave is like stumbling upon a trophy case of a serial killer.For the first time you see fear etched in Remington's face.  His words are profound, ""Lions don't do this. Lions never had a lair like this.  They're doing it for the pleasure.""  Patterson calmly replied, ""They'll know we've been here.""What follows is a strategy of the great hunter and the seasoned military officer.  Unfortunately, there are tragic consequences.The fight scene between Patterson and the last lion keeps you on the edge of your seat.  It is well executed.There has been criticism of Val Kilmer's acting in this fine film.  Patterson is a complex character who evolves over the course of the film.  Kilmer played the role well.This is an exceptional film.  I fail to see why it has been overlooked by the general public.Patterson's book The Man-Eaters of Tsavo is available from Amazon as well.

The film succeeds a lot thanks to the direction and visuals; the lions look truly fantastic! Wow! The other reason the movie really made me keep watching was for the atmosphere of the film. The camera angles, backgrounds, lions POV and stuff like that really gives the movie a real feeling. I personally felt like I was in Africa, running from the Ghost and the Darkness, experiencing the true terror of their roar. The film also gets high marks thanks to its very believable performances. Michael Douglas takes a surprising back seat, but it still a strong character in the film and plays out his tough character well. Val Kilmer is the star though. This is one of his best performances, he masters an Irish accent accurately, is a believable loving husband and a likeable bridge builder. The movie is not perfect however. I didn't really appreciate the voice-overs by the African friend and some of the lion attack sequences are cut too short.

The lead engineer assigned to the project (perfectly played by Vil Kilmer) was hired to build a bridge across a river.  Little does he know that he will face the biggest challenge of his life in tracking down, outwitting, and killing these savage beasts. Micahel Douglas joins the action about half-way into the film.This is a fast-moving, well-crafted, action/drama/horror/thriller type of film--very entertaining and suspenseful. If you like the ""Jurassic Park"" films--you will like this action and suspense (who will be eaten next?). The movie is rated R--but there is absolutely no nudity, no profanity (I think the ""S"" word was used once or twice--but no ""F"" word). The R rating is due to some gore relating to the lion attacks (which look very real, but computer graphics & special effects must have played a large part)--but this is no slasher type movie. The gore shown is minimal--enough to give the viewer a flavor as to how powerful and efficient these lions were in hunting and attacking their prey. This film is much closer to PG-13 than R.Hopefully there will be a future anniversary or special edition that this film deserves. This a bare bones DVD. It is a shame that there is no historical account given regarding the actual events (it is mentioned that the actual lions are stuffed and on display in a museum in Chicago). While the transfer to DVD gives excellent sound and a good picture (sharp and crisp with excellent color), as viewed on my 46-inch large screen, high-defintion TV, played on a Toshiba 1080p HD DVD player)--the picture format is letterboxed, not anamorphic. The letterbox does seem to be larger than other letterboxes.

John Patterson is an engineer assigned in 1899 to oversee the construction of a railway bridge at Tsavo, East Africa, about 175 miles NW of Zanzibar.  On his arrival, a worker describes Tsavo as ""the worst place in the world.""He also discovers workers are being attacked by lions.  In this remote area, this is hardly surprising.  The frequency and number of attacks, though, are off the chart.  Not only are the workers and Patterson terrorized, many of the workers leave the job site, preventing further construction.  Patterson must find a way to rid the place of the lions.  He's an engineer and amateur hunter, not a game expert.Patterson and others try numerous things to trap and kill the lions, or prevent them from entering camp to no avail before a number of victims are taken.  The first time I watched this, I got chills every time a lion attacked.  Imagine trying to survive in such a place.  Patterson eventually bags the lions, and work resumes.A character named Remington is brought in near the end of the picture.  He is a fictional character, but the interaction between Patterson, the natives and him reflects the development of the relationship between Americans, Europeans, Africans, and Indians during the Victorian era.Prior to reviewing this DVD, I read Lt. Col. Patterson's book, ""The Man-Eaters of Tsavo.""  This is a sensational story, and I needed a reality check.  There is artistic license, as usual, in the movie.  But in this case, I find that license a reflection of the real life of Lt. Col. Patterson, who spent many years working in various parts of Africa, living in primitive conditions, and when he found time, hunting various game.The numbers killed by lions are staggering when compared to those of other instances of man-eaters.

Later in life, I wished this book could be made into a movie, and my dream really came true when I purchased  the DVD. This movie is based entirely on the book by English railway bridge  builder, John Patterson.Ironically, the pair of male lions as depicted in the movie was borrowed  from a zoo farm in Alberta, Canada. These lions were fully mane. But in the book, John Patterson described those two lions as lean and maneless...! As factually,  most  lions in Tsavo of Kenya don't have the beautiful mane unlike their cousins in other parts of Africa. This is unusual, maneless male lions because only females don't spot a mane. The movie will keep you on the edge of your chair from the beginning to the end - never a dull moment. I consider this as the best thrilling movie ever made in the wilds of Africa, especially at this time when the public is conscious about nature conservation. Too bad that  when the movie was made in early 1900s, surround sound was not a popular feature and therefore not included, otherwise the roars of these two persistent man-eaters in the dead of the African night would be very nighmarish in our den when we watch the movie...! Yes, these two lions did chomp more than a hundred railway workers that at one stage they were compelled to quit until the pair was finally hunted down. John finally skinned the two man-eating lions and sold their skins  and bones to the field museum at  Springfield, Illioness. This pair of  mounted, maneless  notorious man-eating lions are still there for everyone to see and contemplate.This classic movie depicting  a strange aspect of yesterday-Africa is historically true and thus highly recommended.

There is literary license and plenty of Hollywoodesque touches here but the stroy of two rampaging lions holds the thrills throughout the film.  Michael Douglas gives a good performance as the American hunter with that old bravado and simple talk.  What is evident here is that this film holds nothing back and the humans are fallible.

However, at the time, the world was in love with happy, singing lions thanks to Disney, so that could possibly be the effect.First, I think I should inform almost everyone who reads this that, despite what you hear, almost everything that happened in this story is true.  The hunters in the boxcar missing the lion at close range over and over?  True.  The lions killing just to kill.  True.  Constant rifles being dropped, thus allowing the lions to escape.  True.  Patterson jumping out of a tree and killing the lion as it was EATING HIM!  TRUE.  Everything in this film is true, and if you read any of the books about it, you'll see that it really did happen.  Now onto the review.There's one bad thing about the acting in this movie: Val Kilmer's accent.  It's not quite realistic enough.  Whenver things get intense, he loses it.  However, the rest of the acting is superb.  Michael Douglas does a fabulous job as the Man With No Name character, and the supporting cast of natives is great.  Fear can be seen by everyone, and more importantly, it is real fear.No on to the script.  I have always been a huge fan of William Goldman's since I saw Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid when I was 12, but he truly does a brilliant job here.  The lines are great and the characters are what they are intended to be, either likable, mysterious, or jerks.  The only thing that irks me about the writing is how the character of Remmington(or Redbeard, as it was intended) given a history.  I know that Goldman was forced to write this in, but it truly makes the character look like a wuss instead of keeping his air of mystery around him.  Other than that, Goldman's script is terrific.The directing by Stephen Hopkins is right on and as tense as it should be.  When there is supposed to be fear or paranoia invoked, it is right there and in your face.  This movie also contains some of the most beautiful scenery of the African continent I've seen since OUT OF AFRICA.  Hopkins photographs everything in Tsavo in a washed out sephia that works very well since Tsavo is supposed to be surrounded by death, whether it be from Malaria, religious fights, or those pesky lions.The one thing to me, besides Goldman's script, that stands out is the spectacular musical score.  I can't think right off hand who did the music, but it is PERFECT.  It's dreamy and intense and airy at just the right times.  If I could find it anywhere, I would definitely buy it, and I do not buy movie scores much.  It works with the picture beautifully.As you can tell, I love this film.  I think it is great and powerful and I think everyone should watch it, especially if you love adventure stories or incredible true tales.  For more insights on the film and story, I also reccomend you read Goldman's &quot;Which Lie Did I Tell?&quot;  It adds insight on this truly terrific movie.",5,Did NOT get its just deserves.,993945600,"07 1, 2001",2001,2928,"['am', 'very', 'angered', 'film', 'was', 'not', 'more', 'successful', 'was', 'However', 'time', 'world', 'was', 'love', 'happy', 'singing', 'lions', 'thanks', 'Disney', 'could', 'possibly', 'be', 'effect.First', 'think', 'should', 'inform', 'almost', 'everyone', 'who', 'what', 'hear', 'almost', 'everything', 'happened', 'story', 'true', 'hunters', 'boxcar', 'missing', 'lion', 'close', 'range', 'True', 'lions', 'killing', 'just', 'kill', 'True', 'Constant', 'rifles', 'being', 'dropped', 'thus', 'allowing', 'lions', 'escape', 'True', 'Patterson', 'jumping', 'tree', 'killing', 'lion', 'was', 'EATING', 'HIM', 'TRUE', 'Everything', 'film', 'true', 'read', 'books', ""'ll"", 'see', 'really', 'did', 'happen', 'Now', 'review.There', 'one', 'bad', 'thing', 'acting', 'movie', 'Val', 'Kilmer', 'accent', 'not', 'quite', 'realistic', 'enough', 'Whenver', 'things', 'get', 'intense', 'However', 'rest', 'acting', 'superb', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'fabulous', 'job', 'Man', 'No', 'Name', 'character', 'supporting', 'cast', 'natives', 'great', 'Fear', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'everyone', 'more', 'importantly', 'real', 'fear.No', 'script', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'huge', 'fan', 'William', 'Goldman', 'saw', 'Butch', 'Cassidy', 'Sundance', 'Kid', 'when', 'was', '12', 'truly', 'brilliant', 'job', 'here', 'lines', 'are', 'great', 'characters', 'are', 'what', 'are', 'intended', 'be', 'likable', 'mysterious', 'jerks', 'only', 'thing', 'writing', 'how', 'character', 'Remmington', 'Redbeard', 'was', 'intended', 'given', 'history', 'know', 'Goldman', 'was', 'forced', 'write', 'truly', 'character', 'look', 'wuss', 'instead', 'keeping', 'air', 'mystery', 'Other', 'Goldman', 'script', 'terrific.The', 'directing', 'Stephen', 'Hopkins', 'right', 'as', 'tense', 'should', 'be', 'When', 'supposed', 'be', 'fear', 'paranoia', 'invoked', 'right', 'there', 'face', 'movie', 'also', 'most', 'beautiful', 'scenery', 'African', 'continent', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'OUT', 'OF', 'AFRICA', 'Hopkins', 'photographs', 'everything', 'Tsavo', 'washed', 'out', 'sephia', 'very', 'well', 'Tsavo', 'supposed', 'be', 'surrounded', 'death', 'be', 'Malaria', 'religious', 'fights', 'pesky', 'lions.The', 'one', 'thing', 'Goldman', 'script', 'out', 'spectacular', 'musical', 'score', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'right', 'hand', 'who', 'did', 'music', 'PERFECT', 'dreamy', 'intense', 'airy', 'just', 'right', 'times', 'could', 'find', 'anywhere', 'would', 'definitely', 'buy', 'do', 'not', 'buy', 'movie', 'scores', 'much', 'picture', 'can', 'tell', 'love', 'film', 'think', 'great', 'powerful', 'think', 'everyone', 'should', 'watch', 'especially', 'love', 'adventure', 'stories', 'incredible', 'true', 'tales', 'more', 'insights', 'film', 'story', 'also', 'reccomend', 'read', 'Goldman', 'quot', 'Which', 'Lie', 'Did', 'Tell', 'quot', 'insight', 'truly', 'terrific', 'movie']",The Ghost and the Darkness VHS

416242,A1X1CEGHTHMBL1,6304353634,jjceo,"[0, 0]",Africa is under construction with a massive railroad line in Kenya.  John Henry Patterson (Val Kilmer) is a very good engineer and he is hired to work on the project and get it done as it is getting bogged down and way behind schedule.  Upon his arrival at the construction site he finds that the workers are terrified of the lions that have been attacking the work crew.  Patterson shoots and kills a lion and the workers all respect him as the man who has saved them.  Little do they know that their problems have just begun.Day after day men are killed and they soon discover that there are two more man-eaters that are ravaging the workers at will and they don't seem to be able to stop them.  The workers blame Patterson for not getting rid of the lions and he is even injured while trying to kill them.  The terrified workers name the lions The Ghost and The Darkness as they move like spirits and seem unstoppable.  The railroad sends in famous hunter Charles Remington (Michael Douglas) to help kill the lions and the action is non-stop....This movie is outstanding and the action just continues to escalate throughout the entire film.  The lions kill over 100 men (in the movie) and the movie can get gruesome at times.  The man-eaters work in tandem and are brave and vicious killers.  They are killing as much for sport as they are for eating.  This is based on a true story and the lions are actually on display in the Field Museum in Chicago.

Others have already detailed the acting, plot, etc., so I won't bother.  Does this version have superior A/V quality compared with the previous release?  Unfortunately, the answer is ""no.""  It's the same disc, just with different packaging.  And it has all the same flaws: telecine wobble, overabundance of grain, and poor contrast; it could also use some color correction.  But the worst offense is the aspect ratio; the studio slapped a widescreen transfer into a 4x3 format.  This means that the image you see on a 16x9 TV is only about half of what should be there.  This can be solved by using the zoom function available on most TV sets, but this will a) distort the picture, b) magnify the film's inherent flaws, or c) do both.  In 2013, with 16x9 TVs as the standard, this was just inexcusable.  Shame on them for this substandard DVD.  On its own merits, without consideration of technical problems, I would rate this film at four stars.  But it's difficult to enjoy a movie when the presentation is so poor.  I'm just glad there weren't any problems with the sound as well.  I bought this DVD because I saw ""The Ghost and The Darkness"" in theater years ago, and liked it.  But I can't recommend buying this edition (or the previous one).  My only consolation is that it's cheap, so I'm not out very much money.  In case you're interested, the only ""special feature"" is a theatrical trailer.For those who want more info about the events depicted in the film, there are two books (that I know of) available on Amazon:The Man-Eaters of Tsavo (Peter Capstick Library Series)(in a number of editions), andThe Lions of Tsavo : Exploring the Legacy of Africa's Notorious Man-Eaters.  To my knowledge, the latter book is considered the definitive history of this incident.  The story of the Tsavo lions was also the subject of at least one ""Wild Discovery"" and ""History's Lost and Found"" episode.

He had a large selection of movies both him and I had never heard of. We just picked out one with an interesting case and slid it in. The Ghost and the Darkness is what we got. Surprisingly, this movie is a much better experience than one would think. The story is a little farfetched, but not enough so you feel alienated from the story.John Patterson is sent to Africa to build a bridge. This story takes place in the late 1800s when many European countries were attempting to control Africa. Patterson is sent to build a bridge that would complete a railroad. Upon arriving in Africa, Patterson learns that a lion have attacked a man and killed him. Patterson accepts the responsibility of hunting the lion. Later that night he kills the lion in a single shot. The worker's morale is up do to the thought of safety. Soon another lion threat arrives. Two lions begin attacking the workers. The workers believe they are legendary lions known as The Ghost and The Darkness. Patterson must kill these lions to ensure the workers survive and build the bridge.The story may sound a bit ridiculous, but you learn to love it. The scenery used in this movie is fantastic. My complaint is that sometimes the lighting is too absent. It is hard to see the characters or lions. This is 1996 though, so lighting does not come as easy. The music in the movie works very well. Suspense is perfectly implemented.One problem in this movie is the lifeless characters. They try to be characters, not normal human beings. Patterson is flat and boring. The workers are also hurt by trying to be a character instead of a person. Remington, a world-renowned hunter, brings life to this film. Sadly, he only appears near the end of the viewing.There is some light gore in this movie. You do not see anything, but blood flies all over the place. At one point in the film, there is a giant mass of blood in the middle of the field. This is probably all okay for any mature child. However, if lions attacking people frightens them, this may not be for them.There are not any extras available on this DVD. This works as a cool movie. Watching the cunning lions is interesting. You just have to accept the story for what it is. I recommend giving this one a rent at least.",3,Lions Kill People...you know you are interested,1222387200,"09 26, 2008",2008,2332,"['Ghost', 'DarknessUpon', 'going', 'friend', 'house', 'decided', 'watch', 'movie', 'had', 'large', 'selection', 'movies', 'had', 'never', 'heard', 'just', 'picked', 'out', 'one', 'interesting', 'case', 'slid', 'Ghost', 'Darkness', 'what', 'got', 'Surprisingly', 'movie', 'much', 'better', 'experience', 'one', 'would', 'think', 'story', 'little', 'farfetched', 'not', 'enough', 'feel', 'alienated', 'story.John', 'Patterson', 'sent', 'Africa', 'build', 'bridge', 'story', 'place', 'late', '1800s', 'when', 'many', 'European', 'countries', 'were', 'attempting', 'control', 'Africa', 'Patterson', 'sent', 'build', 'bridge', 'would', 'complete', 'railroad', 'arriving', 'Africa', 'Patterson', 'lion', 'have', 'attacked', 'man', 'killed', 'Patterson', 'responsibility', 'hunting', 'lion', 'Later', 'night', 'lion', 'single', 'shot', 'worker', 'morale', 'up', 'do', 'thought', 'safety', 'Soon', 'lion', 'threat', 'arrives', 'Two', 'lions', 'begin', 'attacking', 'workers', 'workers', 'believe', 'are', 'legendary', 'lions', 'known', 'Ghost', 'Darkness', 'Patterson', 'must', 'kill', 'lions', 'ensure', 'workers', 'survive', 'build', 'bridge.The', 'story', 'may', 'sound', 'bit', 'ridiculous', 'learn', 'love', 'scenery', 'used', 'movie', 'fantastic', 'complaint', 'sometimes', 'lighting', 'too', 'absent', 'hard', 'see', 'characters', 'lions', '1996', 'so', 'lighting', 'not', 'come', 'easy', 'music', 'movie', 'very', 'well', 'Suspense', 'perfectly', 'implemented.One', 'problem', 'movie', 'lifeless', 'characters', 'try', 'be', 'characters', 'not', 'normal', 'human', 'beings', 'Patterson', 'flat', 'boring', 'workers', 'are', 'also', 'hurt', 'trying', 'be', 'character', 'instead', 'person', 'Remington', 'world-renowned', 'hunter', 'life', 'film', 'Sadly', 'only', 'end', 'viewing.There', 'light', 'gore', 'movie', 'do', 'not', 'see', 'anything', 'blood', 'flies', 'place', 'one', 'point', 'film', 'giant', 'mass', 'blood', 'middle', 'field', 'probably', 'okay', 'mature', 'child', 'However', 'lions', 'attacking', 'people', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'are', 'not', 'extras', 'available', 'DVD', 'cool', 'movie', 'Watching', 'cunning', 'lions', 'interesting', 'just', 'have', 'accept', 'story', 'what', 'recommend', 'giving', 'one', 'rent', 'least']",The Ghost and the Darkness VHS

Only John Kani as Samuel, Bernard Hill as the doctor, and Tom Wilkinson as the despicably hateable Beaumont emerge with fine performances.Admittedly, some of the scenes with the lion attacks were effectively frightening and there is one in a dream sequence that is actually breathtaking.Ultimately, I found myself apathetic to the fate of our heroes, and in fact, one of them is cheated out of a good scene (no plot spoiling, though).All in all, an entertaining, if empty thriller.",3,LION EYES,1086912000,"06 11, 2004",2004,981,"['GHOST', 'THE', 'DARKNESS', 'well', 'made', 'movie', 'sweeping', 'vistas', 'African', 'landscape', 'glorious', 'sunsets', 'night', 'scenes', 'wonderful', 'score', 'ever', 'talented', 'Jerry', 'Goldsmith', 'Unfortunately', 'actors', 'script', 'do', ""n't"", 'match', 'type', 'excellence', 'William', 'Goldman', 'story', 'never', 'really', 'know', 'what', 'Val', 'Kilmer', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'tick', 'Kilmer', 'saddled', 'Irish', 'accent', 'ca', ""n't"", 'maintain', 'whole', 'film', 'Douglas', 'attempts', 'be', 'Crocodile', 'Hunter', 'Jim', 'Irwin', 'Only', 'John', 'Kani', 'Samuel', 'Bernard', 'Hill', 'doctor', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'despicably', 'hateable', 'Beaumont', 'emerge', 'fine', 'performances.Admittedly', 'scenes', 'lion', 'attacks', 'were', 'effectively', 'frightening', 'one', 'dream', 'sequence', 'actually', 'breathtaking.Ultimately', 'found', 'apathetic', 'fate', 'heroes', 'fact', 'one', 'cheated', 'good', 'scene', 'plot', 'spoiling', '.All', 'entertaining', 'empty', 'thriller']",The Ghost and the Darkness VHS

Both men end their lives tragically in the mouths of the predators they supposedly were the only people who can kill them.But G&D; has excellent cinematography, and the lions attacks are very well digitally put with the help of fast editing, preceding the scene in Gladiator with the tigers in the ring but more effective.Val Kilmer,gives a very good performance,but I thought Michael Douglas was miscast,although his acting is as always very good.So G&D; is a good thriller, that will keep you at the edge of your seat, and make you reflect upon how powerful nature and its predators can be, and while we have infringed on its territory for years, it is when it fights back that we become vulnerable.",4,Jaws Strikes in Africa!,1025481600,"07 1, 2002",2002,2014,"['watched', 'Ghost', 'Darkness', 'yesterday', 'thought', 'was', 'very', 'entertaining', 'thriller', 'above', 'average', 'direction', 'acting', 'cinematography.It', 'Monster/animal', 'man', 'story', 'film', 'different', 'dozens', 'such', 'movies', 'authenticity', 'story', 'based', 'true', 'events', 'actually', 'happened', 'turn', '20th', 'century', 'Kenya.Watching', 'G', 'D', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'deduce', 'similarities', 'Spielberg', 'Jaws', 'even', 'style', 'films', 'different', 'whereas', 'Jaws', 'had', 'huge', 'impact', 'audience', 'was', 'highly', 'praised', 'G', 'D', 'was', 'not', 'very', 'successful', 'time', 'release.The', 'similarities', 'lie', 'fact', 'stories', 'are', 'based', 'true', 'events', 'dramatized', 'screen', 'Jaws', 'Great', 'White', 'attacks', '1912', 'New', 'Jersey', 'Peter', 'Benchley', 'best', 'seller', 'G', 'D', 'true', 'events', 'two', 'maneating', 'lions', 'who', 'feasted', 'more', '200', 'kind', 'actual', 'lions', 'Tsavo', 'are', 'preserved', 'Field', 'Musuem', 'ChicagoBoth', 'films', 'brought', 'two', 'events', 'attention', 'were', 'largely', 'forgotten', 'unheard', 'films.The', 'experienced', 'shark', 'hunter', 'Robert', 'Powell', 'who', 'yet', 'face', 'greatest', 'challenge', 'unusual', 'behavior', 'monster', 'fish', 'similar', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'character', 'men', 'end', 'lives', 'tragically', 'mouths', 'predators', 'supposedly', 'were', 'only', 'people', 'who', 'can', 'kill', 'them.But', 'G', 'D', 'excellent', 'cinematography', 'lions', 'attacks', 'are', 'very', 'well', 'digitally', 'put', 'help', 'fast', 'editing', 'preceding', 'scene', 'Gladiator', 'tigers', 'ring', 'more', 'effective.Val', 'Kilmer', 'very', 'good', 'performance', 'thought', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'was', 'miscast', 'acting', 'always', 'very', 'good.So', 'G', 'D', 'good', 'thriller', 'will', 'keep', 'edge', 'seat', 'make', 'reflect', 'how', 'powerful', 'nature', 'predators', 'can', 'be', 'have', 'infringed', 'territory', 'years', 'when', 'back', 'become', 'vulnerable']",The Ghost and the Darkness VHS

Very suspenseful!Set in the late 1800's, Val Kilmer plays a military engineer who loves building bridges and has passionately desired to go to Africa his whole life.  He gets his chance when a British bridge project in Africa is going poorly and he is sent to take over and get it done on a very tight schedule.Unfortunately, there are some male lions in the area working together (they never share territory much less work together) and killing for pleasure (not food) and Kilmer is losing workers left and right to these vicious man-eaters.Construction is at a standstill, the workers want to leave the area, but (after 30 deaths) the British agree to hire a renowned hunter who should resolve the lion problem in a few days so they stay and give Douglas and his group of native hunters the benefit of the doubt.  After the first hunt together, the African hunters decide the lions are ghost-demons and they leave.The man-eating lion duo continue to outsmart Kilmer and Douglas and keep boldly taking more lives. Finally after a particularly deadly attack (mass victims) the remaining workers leave and it's just Kilmer, Douglas and a friend against the deadly lions.NOTE: there is a bit of a gore factor to this movie because they show bodies of some of those attacked, and because Kilmer and Douglas use blood (fakey looking) and large animal chunks as bait.  I think the majority of us can handle it, but easily squeamish folks may not want to see this.This movie is interesting, scary/suspenseful and believable (though it is a fictionalized story per Wikipedia).

John Patterson's tale of a pair of man-eating lions wreaking havoc on a railroad construction camp in 19th-century colonial Africa. A pleasant action film which, although somewhat uneven, presents a good adventure story to the likes of a Rudyard Kipling (author of The Man Who Would Be King; The Jungle Book) short story.Patterson (Val Kilmer) is given a deadline to build trestle bridge but is impeded from doing so by the lions. Construction comes to a near halt after Indian and African laborers ascribe supernatural powers to the lions. Determined to challenge the credulity of the workers and complete his project, Patterson decides to hunt them down. The lions are elusive however and he obtains help from an American expatriate lion hunter (Michael Douglas)to take care of the pesky felines. The lions are eventually dispatched but not before tragedy befalls the characters.The film is well paced with a decent plot line. One theme conveyed in the film is the battle between credulance and empirical thought. Patterson, the engineer, is the voice of science and reason which treats the lions as nothing more than a wild nuisance that can be easily disposed with. The laborers reflect credulence and superstition: people who would prefer to accept nature as a divine force that no one can master. As he hunts the lions, Patterson himself abandons his empirical methodologies and adopts a more spiritual side in order to understand the bestial forces of nature. This theme works well in depicting the socio-cultural contrasts prevalent in colonial times during the 19th century. The acting was decent although Val Kilmer, despite his amazing acting talents, doesn't come off as an Irishman very well. The film has beautiful cinematography and a good soundtrack.This is a good adventure film that can be enjoyed by the whole family.",4,Science vs. Superstition,1091491200,"08 3, 2004",2004,1883,"['William', 'Goldman', 'script', 'adapted', 'Lt.', 'Col.', 'John', 'Patterson', 'tale', 'pair', 'man-eating', 'lions', 'wreaking', 'havoc', 'railroad', 'construction', 'camp', '19th-century', 'colonial', 'Africa', 'A', 'pleasant', 'action', 'film', 'somewhat', 'uneven', 'good', 'adventure', 'story', 'likes', 'Rudyard', 'Kipling', 'author', 'Man', 'Who', 'Would', 'Be', 'King', 'Jungle', 'Book', 'short', 'story.Patterson', 'Val', 'Kilmer', 'given', 'deadline', 'build', 'trestle', 'bridge', 'impeded', 'doing', 'so', 'lions', 'Construction', 'near', 'halt', 'Indian', 'African', 'laborers', 'ascribe', 'supernatural', 'powers', 'lions', 'Determined', 'challenge', 'credulity', 'workers', 'complete', 'project', 'Patterson', 'hunt', 'down', 'lions', 'are', 'elusive', 'however', 'help', 'American', 'expatriate', 'lion', 'hunter', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'take', 'care', 'pesky', 'felines', 'lions', 'are', 'eventually', 'dispatched', 'not', 'tragedy', 'characters.The', 'film', 'well', 'paced', 'decent', 'plot', 'line', 'One', 'theme', 'conveyed', 'film', 'battle', 'credulance', 'empirical', 'thought', 'Patterson', 'engineer', 'voice', 'science', 'reason', 'lions', 'nothing', 'more', 'wild', 'nuisance', 'can', 'be', 'easily', 'disposed', 'laborers', 'reflect', 'credulence', 'superstition', 'people', 'who', 'would', 'prefer', 'accept', 'nature', 'divine', 'force', 'one', 'can', 'master', 'lions', 'Patterson', 'empirical', 'methodologies', 'more', 'spiritual', 'side', 'order', 'understand', 'bestial', 'forces', 'nature', 'theme', 'well', 'depicting', 'socio-cultural', 'contrasts', 'prevalent', 'colonial', 'times', '19th', 'century', 'acting', 'was', 'decent', 'Val', 'Kilmer', 'amazing', 'acting', 'talents', ""n't"", 'come', 'off', 'Irishman', 'very', 'well', 'film', 'beautiful', 'cinematography', 'good', 'soundtrack.This', 'good', 'adventure', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'whole', 'family']",The Ghost and the Darkness VHS

416296,AJUEE2C2EJ0V3,6304353634,Paperbackstash,"[0, 0]","The plot is basic and gets to the point fast enough. Col. John Henry Patterson goes to Africa to finish a job on railroad construction in a small village. They have a little lion situation on their hands, and Patterson tries to hold on to the workers but eventually most of them leave despite his best efforts. (Imagine that! I think I'd rather lose a little pay over being lion chow any day!)  Enter obvious hero type Charles Remington (Douglas), lion killer extraordinaire. You can almost imagine music playing in the background whenever he has a scene. Now there are three men left to battle the two beasts. Who will prove to be the true kings of the jungle when all is said and done?Based on the true story of two lions that actually began hunting and eating humans in Africa, Ghost and the Darkness paints a realistic enough picture while staying entertaining at the same time. These lions are barbarous creatures, no real selectiveness in their slaughter. For this kind of picture, the death count is relatively high, and although much of the graphic violence is only hinted upon, a lot is still shown in all its juicy glory.I have always held a special place in my heart for Michael Douglas. He's a fantastic actor, and his character was the more interesting of the group. (Not that that's saying a whole lot). Val Kilmer showed off his good looks and acting skills again. All did their job well enough, even the ones only there for brief glimpses before becoming lion fodder. For directing, there are some slick lion POV shots, as well as shots of the victims being dragged.The film employs great usage of sound, particularly the lions breathing, peoples fear, growling, and the natural music of the night. The script held a hint here and there about something supernatural in the air...a nice possibility, but to me that took a little away from the power of just having these being two pissed off kitties.Ghost and the Darkness is an interesting tale that exploits the potential cruelty of one of nature's greatest predators, and does a decent job of inserting drama from the human players at the same time. My only gripe would be that things could have been spruced up a bit between the action sequences. Sometimes things just grew a little tedious, even dull at some points.I cared about the people well enough but didn't really warm up to many besides Douglas' character. Even Kilmer, doing the great job he did, couldn't fully fire up the man he played. The pacing and drama were a little off and may I say slightly *gasp* boring. But overall, it's worth a watch. It's a good nature suspense picture that has some violent scenarios and takes itself seriously. Add into the more than competent actors, creepy furry villains, and you have something worth watching, and maybe buying, although only for a fairy cheap amount.",3,"A little dull, but intriguing",1379635200,"09 20, 2013",2013,2833,"['plot', 'basic', 'point', 'fast', 'enough', 'Col.', 'John', 'Henry', 'Patterson', 'Africa', 'finish', 'job', 'railroad', 'construction', 'small', 'village', 'have', 'little', 'lion', 'situation', 'hands', 'Patterson', 'tries', 'hold', 'workers', 'eventually', 'most', 'leave', 'best', 'efforts', 'Imagine', 'think', ""'d"", 'rather', 'lose', 'little', 'pay', 'being', 'lion', 'chow', 'day', 'Enter', 'obvious', 'hero', 'type', 'Charles', 'Remington', 'Douglas', 'lion', 'killer', 'extraordinaire', 'can', 'almost', 'imagine', 'music', 'playing', 'background', 'whenever', 'scene', 'Now', 'are', 'three', 'men', 'left', 'battle', 'two', 'beasts', 'Who', 'will', 'prove', 'be', 'true', 'kings', 'jungle', 'when', 'said', 'done', 'Based', 'true', 'story', 'two', 'lions', 'actually', 'began', 'hunting', 'eating', 'humans', 'Africa', 'Ghost', 'Darkness', 'realistic', 'enough', 'picture', 'staying', 'entertaining', 'same', 'time', 'lions', 'are', 'barbarous', 'creatures', 'real', 'selectiveness', 'slaughter', 'kind', 'picture', 'death', 'count', 'relatively', 'high', 'much', 'graphic', 'violence', 'only', 'hinted', 'upon', 'lot', 'still', 'shown', 'juicy', 'glory.I', 'have', 'always', 'held', 'special', 'place', 'heart', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'fantastic', 'actor', 'character', 'was', 'more', 'interesting', 'group', 'Not', 'saying', 'whole', 'lot', 'Val', 'Kilmer', 'showed', 'good', 'looks', 'acting', 'skills', 'again', 'did', 'job', 'well', 'enough', 'even', 'ones', 'only', 'there', 'brief', 'glimpses', 'becoming', 'lion', 'fodder', 'directing', 'are', 'slick', 'lion', 'POV', 'shots', 'as', 'well', 'shots', 'victims', 'being', 'dragged.The', 'film', 'great', 'usage', 'sound', 'particularly', 'lions', 'breathing', 'peoples', 'fear', 'growling', 'natural', 'music', 'night', 'script', 'held', 'hint', 'here', 'there', 'something', 'supernatural', 'air', 'nice', 'possibility', 'took', 'little', 'away', 'power', 'just', 'having', 'being', 'two', 'pissed', 'kitties.Ghost', 'Darkness', 'interesting', 'tale', 'potential', 'cruelty', 'one', 'nature', 'greatest', 'predators', 'decent', 'job', 'inserting', 'drama', 'human', 'players', 'same', 'time', 'only', 'gripe', 'would', 'be', 'things', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'spruced', 'up', 'bit', 'action', 'sequences', 'Sometimes', 'things', 'just', 'grew', 'little', 'tedious', 'even', 'dull', 'points.I', 'cared', 'people', 'well', 'enough', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'warm', 'up', 'many', 'besides', 'Douglas', 'character', 'Even', 'Kilmer', 'doing', 'great', 'job', 'did', 'could', ""n't"", 'fully', 'fire', 'up', 'man', 'played', 'pacing', 'drama', 'were', 'little', 'off', 'may', 'say', 'slightly', '*gasp*', 'boring', 'overall', 'watch', 'good', 'nature', 'suspense', 'picture', 'violent', 'scenarios', 'seriously', 'Add', 'more', 'competent', 'actors', 'creepy', 'furry', 'villains', 'have', 'something', 'worth', 'watching', 'maybe', 'buying', 'only', 'fairy', 'cheap', 'amount']",The Ghost and the Darkness VHS

He is a renowned professional who has been successful in the past and who has been waiting his whole life to travel to the dark continent. He is thrilled when he is hired by Robert Beaumont (Tom Wilkinson). However, all the excitement he brings on his travel will soon end and turn into fear and despair as he encounters one of the most amazing true stories ever told.The construction site is, to all accounts, cursed. There are two teams who don't necessarilly see eye to eye, and the construction itself is a daunting task. Beaumont is a mean man who enjoys torturing and pressing his employees (even from the distance between England and Kenya). But these are the least of the problems that Patterson has to face. The site is also under siege by two maneaters, two lions to which the locals gave the names of The Ghost and The Darkness.These lions don't behave like normal lions do. They work as a team and they don't only hunt for food, they hunt for fun. Their attacks leave a bloody trail in puts the greatest fear into the construction workers hearts. Patterson needs to do something to keep the work on schedule, but none of his ideas seem to work in stoping the two beasts. Thus enters Charles Remington (Michael Douglas), an american hunting legend who lives with a tribe of bushmen.Together they fight the lions in every way they can, but in the end, not everyone will survive...The ghost and the darkness is a really great film. It's greatest strength is the suspense that the lion attacks bring with them. How many times can Patterson and Remington face death? Who will die next? Will they kill the animals?

I've read many conflicting reports as to what was the cause of this bloody carnage. Some say it was the fact that the lions food source was hunted and ate by the railway workers.Whatever the reason, the events really did take place. These lions killed many people brutally. They did work as a team, something that is normal to lions in this area of Africa. In other areas the females do the hunting.I think what the film does do well, is convey the terror that was felt by every worker building that railroad. Yes sadly Hollywood has always stretched the truth a bit. I don't know why they cant ever just stick to the story, reality is always better than fiction.Well putting all that aside, the film hits the mark in every way. When I saw it, I didn't think about how or whether it stuck to the story, I just watched it for the entertainment value. This movie is definitely worth a watch. P.S. As narrated at the end of the movie, these lions are on display at a museum in Chicago. The museums name is the Field Museum. Check out the website, they even show the lions! I might add, I've also seen the movie male lion, the one that was in the actual film! I say 'Lion' because the other one died. I saw it at a zoo in Southern Ontario, Canada.

The story is about two man-eating lions who terrorize the village of Tsavo as Colonel John Patterson tries to build an important bridge across a river.  Patterson and a famous hunter, Henry Remington, attempt over and over again to kill the two lions until finally the workers decide to leave the area because they are so afraid of the lions.  The hunting scenes are truly well done.  The scene where Patterson and Remington discover the den of the lions is a great scene that shows that the lions are in no way normal.  Val Kilmer and Michael Douglas both give great performances as Patterson and Remington.  Douglas' performance is a little over the top, but it works very well here.  The film is beautifully shot with an excellent backing by Jerry Goldsmith's musical score.  The DVD is a little disappointing with very few extras but for the movie alone it is worth the purchase.

416335,A3BOH0F7V12H7O,6304353634,William Kendall,"[1, 3]","One of my favourite films. A bridge being built in Africa at the end of the 19th century forms the backdrop of an astonishing adventure, based on real events. An Irish engineer (Val Kilmer) gets hired to build the bridge by an arrogant businessman (Tom Wilkinson). His work is interrupted by the presence of two lions attacking his workers. Kilmer is ideally cast as the engineer Colonel Patterson, a good husband and impending father who is able to work with people completely outside his culture, and who finds himself in a desperate situation as the killings continue. Michael Douglas plays an exceptional character role as a fictitious hunter brought in to help, a man who doesn't like to hunt but does it because it's what he's good at. John Kani plays Samuel, the crew foreman, right hand man, and friend to Patterson, a warm and wise local man who holds his own fear of lions. Brian McCardie appears as the overly cheerful and evangelical assistant Starling, an exuberant and somewhat out of his place white man at the site. This film was the first time I saw Bernard Hill and Tom Wilkinson in anything, and they've gone on to be personal favourite actors. Hill is the jaded, cynical camp doctor, disgusted by the true purpose of the railroad: to solidify control of Africa. Wilkinson as Beaumont is an arrogant, thoughtless brute only concerned with his own place in history, having little regard for the people working for him, and it's a terrific, though short role. Stunning landscapes abound throughout the film, and the score by Jerry Goldsmith completes the picture. Frightening at times, this film really, really gets under your skin, makes you feel like you're there in Africa, and ensures that you'll never quite look at tall savannah grasses the same way again.",5,The Devil Has Come To Tsavo,1359504000,"01 30, 2013",2013,1779,"['One', 'favourite', 'films', 'bridge', 'being', 'built', 'Africa', 'end', '19th', 'century', 'forms', 'backdrop', 'astonishing', 'adventure', 'based', 'real', 'events', 'Irish', 'engineer', 'Val', 'Kilmer', 'hired', 'build', 'bridge', 'arrogant', 'businessman', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'work', 'interrupted', 'presence', 'two', 'lions', 'attacking', 'workers', 'Kilmer', 'ideally', 'cast', 'engineer', 'Colonel', 'Patterson', 'good', 'husband', 'impending', 'father', 'who', 'able', 'work', 'people', 'completely', 'culture', 'who', 'desperate', 'situation', 'killings', 'continue', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'exceptional', 'character', 'role', 'fictitious', 'hunter', 'brought', 'help', 'man', 'who', ""n't"", 'like', 'hunt', 'what', 'good', 'John', 'Kani', 'Samuel', 'crew', 'foreman', 'right', 'hand', 'man', 'friend', 'Patterson', 'warm', 'wise', 'local', 'man', 'who', 'own', 'fear', 'lions', 'Brian', 'McCardie', 'overly', 'cheerful', 'evangelical', 'assistant', 'Starling', 'exuberant', 'somewhat', 'place', 'white', 'man', 'site', 'film', 'was', 'first', 'time', 'saw', 'Bernard', 'Hill', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'anything', ""'ve"", 'gone', 'be', 'personal', 'favourite', 'actors', 'Hill', 'jaded', 'cynical', 'camp', 'doctor', 'disgusted', 'true', 'purpose', 'railroad', 'solidify', 'control', 'Africa', 'Wilkinson', 'Beaumont', 'arrogant', 'thoughtless', 'brute', 'only', 'concerned', 'own', 'place', 'history', 'having', 'little', 'regard', 'people', 'working', 'terrific', 'short', 'role', 'Stunning', 'landscapes', 'film', 'score', 'Jerry', 'Goldsmith', 'picture', 'Frightening', 'times', 'film', 'really', 'really', 'skin', 'feel', ""'re"", 'Africa', ""'ll"", 'never', 'quite', 'look', 'tall', 'savannah', 'same', 'way', 'again']",The Ghost and the Darkness VHS
