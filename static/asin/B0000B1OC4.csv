Sporting a set of stated rules, Spurlock`s ""ridiculous diet,"" as his personal physician quips, jump starts a fault finding mission with the world's largest fast food retailer. Armed with testimonials, statistics, and nutritional information, Spurlock also provides counter contrasts to compare with his extreme situation. He does show that McDonald's food is appetizing, except for a couple of scenes that make us want to wretch, including one that's over the top. Nevertheless, he does try to capture a spokesperson from the franchise to talk to him, and he does admirably offer us a better bill of fare at a school cafeteria in Appleton, WI.The variety of aspects he approaches his topic is skillful and informative fun. Spurlock and company deserve a lot of credit. 'Super Size Me' starts and ends framed by a famous lawsuit, and although the results are mostly known, I won't spoil the results, except to say that I enjoyed the outcome. For all of us, healthy and unhealthy living is sometimes a matter of choice. Fortunately, with Morgan Spurlock, it is an informed choice.",4,An Informative Choice,1187568000,"08 20, 2007",2007,1226,"['Documentary', 'meister', 'Morgan', 'Spurlock', 'extremes', 'Super', 'Size', 'Me', 'captures', 'what', 'eat', 'nothing', 'McDonald', 'food', 'thirty', 'days', 'Sporting', 'set', 'stated', 'rules', 'Spurlock', 's', 'ridiculous', 'diet', 'personal', 'physician', 'quips', 'jump', 'fault', 'finding', 'mission', 'world', 'largest', 'fast', 'food', 'retailer', 'Armed', 'testimonials', 'statistics', 'nutritional', 'information', 'Spurlock', 'also', 'counter', 'contrasts', 'compare', 'extreme', 'situation', 'show', 'McDonald', 'food', 'appetizing', 'couple', 'scenes', 'make', 'want', 'wretch', 'including', 'one', 'top', 'Nevertheless', 'try', 'capture', 'spokesperson', 'franchise', 'talk', 'admirably', 'offer', 'better', 'bill', 'fare', 'school', 'cafeteria', 'Appleton', 'WI.The', 'variety', 'aspects', 'topic', 'skillful', 'informative', 'fun', 'Spurlock', 'company', 'deserve', 'lot', 'credit', 'Size', 'Me', 'starts', 'ends', 'framed', 'famous', 'lawsuit', 'results', 'are', 'mostly', 'known', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'results', 'say', 'enjoyed', 'outcome', 'healthy', 'unhealthy', 'living', 'sometimes', 'matter', 'choice', 'Fortunately', 'Morgan', 'Spurlock', 'informed', 'choice']",N/A

His diet was entirely Mc Donnalds.  This movie is approachable on so many levels for so many people.  He uses an orderly process to show this resembling the scientific method if you are familar with that.  It does not matter you do not.  He has his health evaluated prior to beginning this experience and during the process.  The health care providers who are monitoring him are shocked at what exactly is happening although possible.  He also lets us into his life and his relationship with his Vegan Chef signifigant other.  Her fears for his health and the changes in their relationship given his lack of function in the bedroom following his new diet.  It is obvious that he is willing to sacrafice himself for the movie.  He does recover after the documentary because his signifigant other has planned how to help him afterwards.  She actually is contacted and gets a book written about his diet to recover from this Junk food only diet.  This is not covered in the documentary, but happens later.  With a great deal of determination and work he does recover from his experiment, but not without showing what it did to his health in a very short time.This helped me with my cravings for fast food for a long time.  It would be a great way to jump start a diet of healthy living.  It is very inspiring.I love documentaries and this one is a must see if you love them too.Anyone can get something out of this movie.  It is funny at the same time if that is possible.  But it is.  It is the filmakers personality.  Not a dry documentary.This one is okay for kids and teens as long as you do not mind hearing a little bit about impotence.  Very little.  It may go over their heads when they hear he is not as good in the bedroom after his diet.  That is the only thing I can think of that might be objectionale to some people.  I like to add these kid notes just in case because some people shelter their kids about certain things.  If you are a teacher you may be able to edit this part out if needed not to upset parents.  It is really small.Incidentally Mc Donnalds phased out their supersize terminology after this movie.

769983,AQ8DU6XVA3USJ,B0000B1OC4,"Alejandra Vernon ""artist & illustrator""","[8, 8]","Morgan Spurlock came up with the terrific idea of using himself as a guinea pig for this documentary, even if it meant temporarily endangering his health and suffering some indigestion. Under medical supervision, he went to 20 cities and only ate at McDonald's, eating everything on the menu at least once for 30 days. Spurlock certainly has done a service in a cause I believe in, to educate people in nutrition and the dangers of digging one's grave with fast food container. Above his message of dietary abuse, Spurlock is also an excellent filmmaker, and deftly balances facts, interviews, and the progress of his personal foray into the world of greasy, sugary junk food, often with a good slice of humor. Yes, it is manipulated in parts, but there is so much information in the film for those who eat in McDonald's or any of their competitors to learn, that a little embellishment is forgivable.What puzzles me, is where have our taste buds gone? I remember many years ago attempting to eat a Big Mac, and having to spit it out. Much of the attraction is the ""idea"" of McDonald's...Ronald the clown, the toys, the packaging, as well as an addictive x factor in the highly processed food, and the film clearly points all this out. Among the DVD extras not to be missed is the long interview with Eric Schlossen, author of ""Fast Food Nation,"" and the short segment on how Spurlock's garbage increased along with his waistline. Good cinematography by Scott Ambrozy and top notch editing add to the enjoyment of this award winning documentary, which has a running time of 100 minutes.I live across the street from a high school, and see the future of America waddle in and out. I think it would be a good idea for all the kids and their families to watch this documentary, so that they become more aware of what they are doing to their health, and what the future costs will be in doctor's bills and medications. It does seem that the film (as well as a few lawsuits) has influenced the market however, by eliminating the super sizes, and enlarging the options in the menu. Bravo!

I was in Europe at the time, and the people in the theater literally gasped when they showed the huge drink sizes they have in the US.  For me, this is normal.  Also, people really couldn't believe what the US suburbs look like, with one Walmart, Petsmart and Wendys after another, which I am used to.I thought Spurlock made a really valid point -- people do eat the way he does everyday and get little or not physical activity and they wonder why they get fat.  I disagree with the previous posters -- Spurlock ate exactly the way most people do.  I've never seen anyone go to McDonalds and just order a salad.  Wouldn't happen.He also brings in conflicting points of view, including the Big Mac eater, who proves you can eat fast food and stay thin.

And now I'm going to buy another copy for myself.  I also bought The Great American Detox Diet which was written by Alex Jamieson.People who says things like ""this stuff is obvious!"" or ""this is dumb!"" are missing the point in my opinion.  Parts of this dvd are meant to be entertaining and are more comedic, other parts are serious, but it's all informative.  You can't make a movie that says nothing but ""McDeath! McDeath!"" for an hour and a half and expect people to learn anything.  They balanced many, many things and did it REALLY well.On the commentary track, he mentions that he knows most people don't eat EVERY meal at McDonald's, but they might eat breakfast at McDonald's, lunch at Burger King, and dinner at Kentucky Fried Chicken.  Or they might eat dinner at home which consists of Cheetos, pizza, and Diet Pepsi.  It happens more often than people want to admit!  The point is that we should think about what we're putting into our bodies and make educated choices.  Also, heavy meat consumption can cause impotence, so if nothing else (like death) gets your attention maybe that will.Also, I think McDonald's using birthday parties, playgrounds, nutritionally devoid Happy Meals with the ever present ""free"" toy, is pretty creepy when you really look at what they're doing to kids.  (Think Joe Camel.)I guess parents are supposed to be the villains that say ""No Johnny!  You can't have the (fill-in-the-blank) Happy Meal!  You're gettin' a SALAD!!!  The sound you're now hearing is Johnny on the floor shrieking at the top of his lungs.  Bon Apetit.  Well now they let you substitute apple slices for the fries in Happy Meals, but I think it comes with sugary caramel dipping sauce, so I don't know if that's really an improvement or not.Anyway, watching Morgan deteriorate over the 30 day period is like watching a time lapse video of a slow suicide.  Some people wonder why they gained 40 pounds after high school, ""when they weren't looking"".  Well, the amount of exercise we get (if any) and our food choices are to blame.I think Morgan's main complaint with McDonald's is their claim that their food is healthy and meant to be eaten every day, their limited amount of healthy food choices, and the way they market to children by using clowns and TV shows.P.S. This isn't an anti-meat dvd because Morgan loves his pork, especially ham!!!  And you CAN eat somewhat healthier food at fast food restaurants if you exercise a little will power.

Morgan Spurlock was both innovative and humorous in his approach to making this film.  For those of you who don't know the ""story"" of this film, director Spurlock decided to eat nothing but McDonald's for 30 days.  The rules that 1) he had to eat three meals per day, all from McDonald's, 2) he had to eat every menu item at least once, 3) if he were hungry during the day, he could eat non-McDonald's food, but if McDonald's didn't sell it, he couldn't eat it (for example, if he wanted to eat a vitamin, he couldn't because McDonald's doesn't sell vitamins), 4) he had to finish everything, and 5) if the cashier asked if he wanted to super-size, he had to say yes.  Furthermore, he wasn't allowed to exercize because the average American does not exercize on a daily basis.  Before Spurlock began this ""experiment"", he consulted three different doctors.  Each of them, while discouraging this, thought that nothing too drastic would happen to him as a result.  And so it began.30 days of nothing but McDonald's food really took its toll on Spurlock.  After only 2 days, he was already vomiting.  And things only got worse from there.In addition to the eating experiment, the director gave us some facts regarding why fast food is so popular nowadays.  Spurlock also interviewed other people related to the fast food business (like a Baskin Robbins associate), as well as a guy who is part of some Big Mac club.  Furthermore, he ATTEMPTED to interview some of the McDonald's brass, but the execs would never even take his calls.Now, you must remember that this experiment was very extreme (most people don't finish their entire meals), but it was not far from the truth.

My young children did not watch it all and some of the language made me not want them to watch it, however, they saw enough to make McDonalds less appetizing even to them.  Now, my 5 year old asks about any food served him ""Is this good for me?""

I looked at that site and I would suggest that the viewer consider the facts a bit more carefully than did the earlier reviewer.  First of all, the internet site with the contrary message is devoted to free market doctrine (i.e., ""Don't criticize big business!"").  Secondly, one Mcdieter is described as a fitness nut and continued his heavy exercising during his experiment, the other bought food at McDonalds with fewer calories than prior to her diet.The article in question states as the bottom line that weight gain is the result of several factors and not just the food and that one should consider the nutritional value of their food.  This obvious conclusion does not contradict the movie in question.  The filmmaker makes a point that most people are not exercising and children's physical activities are undermined both at home and at school.  The article's author also does not take into account the film's point that finding nutritional information at the fast food restaurants is often impossible, and always impossible at many school cafeterias.  My kids' school served nachos one day this week as the main course.In sum, this dvd is without the cleaner story telling and professional look of a Michael Moore expose, but it is hard hitting and hopefully it will make an impact with its viewers.

769996,AI37X1O7K72FZ,B0000B1OC4,Anti-Hipster,"[16, 23]","Morgan Spurlock makes much ado about America's ""obesity epidemic,"" which he attributes to fast food consumption. To test his hypothesis, he constructs a meaningless experiment: eat nothing but McDonald's food for a month. Apparently, Spurlock thinks that if he gains enough weight, it will establish a correlation between America's rising obesity population and fast food-only diets. This experiment is so absurd that I have to assume he has some other motive for doing it.Naturally, he gains weight. Does this prove that obesity rates have risen because people are eating nothing but McDonald's food? It demonstrates nothing of the sort. McDonald's, in fact, may have very little to do with obesity rates. The growth of certain ethnic populations (Hispanics, for example) may have contributed to the increase in aggregate obesity rates (it would have been informative if he had broken obesity rates down by ethnicity). Also, obesity is measured by the BMI, which doesn't account for muscle and bone mass, making things look worse than they really are. None of this figures into his analysis of obesity. He just assumes the cause of America's ""obesity epidemic"" is fast food, and designs an absurd experiment to prove it.All one can conclude from his documentary is that he or his financial backers do not like McDonald's. The documentary is just an attack on the company. He wants people to think that McDonald's food is unhealthy because he ate it and became unhealthy.

Eat it all the time, and you'll see and feel the negative effects it has on your body. As a former fast food junkie myself, I cringed everytime Spurlock ate a McDisgustinglyHugeSandwichThat'llMakeYouFat. Sure, you can eat this stuff maybe once a month and be okay, but honestly, should you even do that??Spurlock eats McDonald's for thirty days. Morning, noon, and night. Whatever he eats must be from McDonald's. No eating veggies on the side. On day three, he's so sickened at the amount of food that he's eaten that he throws up. After that, after this ""hump,"" he's fine. But he's not fine. He's gaining weight at a rate I didn't think possible, his cholesterol goes bad, his organs are messed up, and the doctors are telling him to quit doing this to his body. This was a once healthy guy! We watch as he morphs from a healthy, happy guy, into a Mcdepressed, Mcman-boobed, McDonald's junkie.This documentary is riddled with all kinds of cool facts-- from calorie counts to what schools are serving (which is really intereseting-- get this-- it doesn't cost much more for a school to serve healthy foods than it does junk and soda, but they do it anyway! Why? Because they don't CARE!) I knew that America was the fattest country, but I didn't even think about it being close to ""the stupidest.""

And while I felt really sympathetic to the message, I just felt the whole documentary was clunky and disjointed. It seemed to reach partly for a semi-comic presentation (which it didn't quite reach) and partly for shock tactics - (Spurlock vomiting out of the car was a low point and that was on day 3)While I really understand the message - after all here is an incredibly healthy young man - clearly with vegan tendencies given that his girlfriend is a vegan chef. I don't know if I missed it or not, but I don't think it was made clear whether he is or not a vegan. He goes to three different types of doctors to analyse his health. All gave him a clean bill or health. At the same time he asked them what they thought the results of him eating only Macdonalds for a month - their responses were surprising to me, they seemed to think the only result would be increased weight not the plethora of problems he ended up with.Spurlock also gave himself a few other rules. He could only exercise as much as the average American (around 2,000 steps a day), and if the order-taker asks if he would like to super-size his order he has to.All this is interspersed with information about how many Macdona;ds there are, the increasing size portions, the incredible increase - even in the last 20 years alone - of obese Americans, and the possible reasons for this.As I write this I keep wondering why I didn't find this documentary interesting. It really had great information in it. Yet I found it clunky in its presentation, I didn't like the constant views of Spurlock eating MacDonalds and making wry comments on it. When on Day three he spewed his meal up I was disgusted - they really seemed to relish the moment and played it for all it was worth, even lovingly following the vomit out the window onto the street - a really low moment for me. I felt the issue of what he was doing was being lost on a cheap shot.I think I just prefer documentaries that are more analytical and less reliant on cheap tactics - but I have to congratulate Spurlock as he definitely managed to illustrate his point.

While on this quest, Mr. Spurlock reveals that America has been 'McDonald-ized'.  Some of the more startling revelations: One in every three establishments in the United States is some kind of restaurant; more than 90% of all commericial products directed towards kids is for sugary or fat-laden foods; and physical exercise is more scarce than ever among ALL age groups.  When the 30 days are finally up, Morgan has ingested 12 pounds of fat and 30 pounds of sugar. (even after trading in his Cokes and shakes for Dasani water) He has gained 25 pounds, his cholesterol has shot up 65 points, and has been recommended not to eat ANY kind of fast food for the next YEAR so his body can recover from the harmful effects of the food he has eaten!!!This documentary is an alarming wake-up call to the world that fast food is indeed 'toxic' and that we should all take more precautions as to what we choose to eat.

Now I do believe there's quite a bit of exaggerating taking place here involving the guy conducting an experiment where he goes 30 days eating *nothing* but McDonalds food.While it's definitely true you'd gain weight and lose your breath after a month, I'm not quite sure you'd gain *that* much weight and lose *that* much breath.  I mean after 30 days, suddenly you wouldn't have trouble walking up the same flight of stairs that was easily achieved just a month before.  Perhaps I'm underestimating our metabolism since we're all distinctively different, but I doubt it.  I can however understand the one segment where he throws up in his car after eating a super sized meal.Anyway there's more to this documentary besides going 30 days on a strict McDonalds diet.  The man also interviews people about their favorite fast food places and frequently visits the doctors for health updates.  Eventually he ventures into public schools to see how much nutrition the kids are actually receiving during their lunch meals.

I found it personally inspirational although I concede readily that subtlety is not one of Morgan Spurlock's personal attributes.  He certainly beats the viewer over the head with the points that he makes.  Obviously vilifying McDonalds is not a solution to America's obesity woes and there is no easy way in which to reverse our national trend of corpulence, but I think that efforts like this one undeniably help to bring attention to our overeating.  This attention will hopefully make people more conscious, and also more self-conscious, about the risk to our lives inherent in the regular consumption of high fat and high sodium processed foods.Aesthetically, the film is well-crafted.  Original artwork appears to have been created and the graphics, along with the soundtrack, is quite appealing.  Concerning the narrator, as a person, Spurlock is playful and good-natured which somewhat belies his statements during the film about becoming depressed.

One reason I opted to watch the movie is because a) it was up for an Oscar and b) Paul Newman has been in England on a trip to push his Newmans Own brand of healthy items that McDonald carries here in the states and in Europe.Therein lays the main flaw of this movie.Morgan Spurlock, ate at McDonald's for a full month, three times a day. But...he seemed to only choose high fat foods and not the salads and other more healthy choices 99% of the time.  As two young black teens/men in the movie noted, they eat at McDonalds but they also are very physically active.  Therein lays the flaw of the movie.What would have happened had Mr. Spurlock set out to see how 'healthy' eating the healthy food choices in the smallest sizes ?  Maybe he wouldn't have gained weight.  Maybe he would haven't vomited for an over stuffed stomach.  But lets be honest ... he didn't want to show any positives about McDonalds.Fact is this. Eat to much of homemade foods three times a day and you will probably get fat and unhealthy.  Years ago I ate at a health food store the same high fat non-meat, vegetarian choices weekly and I gained weight.  A vegan friend gained weight when she ate high fat foods as well.The bottom line is this. Moderation.  While I don't choose to eat McDonald fries, hamburgers etc, I do admit that on occasion I eat an ice cream cone since it is lower in fat than most ice cream.  My food choices and servings are much more French mode.The problem isn't McDonalds food as much as it is Americans pure laziness to not eat all the time, and pick poor food choices.  I don't blame the alcohol makers for the drunk driver hitting and killing my husband anymore than I blame the fast food industry for Americans becoming the fattest people in the developed world.How about we push personal responsibility instead of what Dr. Carolyn Myss in her books calls victimology?",4,Flawed.....but interesting,1110672000,"03 13, 2005",2005,1909,"['movie', 'overall', 'interesting', 'One', 'reason', 'opted', 'watch', 'movie', 'was', 'up', 'Oscar', 'b', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'been', 'England', 'trip', 'push', 'Newmans', 'Own', 'brand', 'healthy', 'items', 'McDonald', 'here', 'states', 'Europe.Therein', 'main', 'flaw', 'movie.Morgan', 'Spurlock', 'ate', 'McDonald', 'full', 'month', 'three', 'times', 'day', 'seemed', 'only', 'choose', 'high', 'fat', 'foods', 'not', 'salads', 'other', 'more', 'healthy', 'choices', '99', '%', 'time', 'two', 'young', 'black', 'teens/men', 'movie', 'noted', 'eat', 'McDonalds', 'also', 'are', 'very', 'physically', 'active', 'Therein', 'flaw', 'movie.What', 'would', 'have', 'happened', 'had', 'Mr.', 'Spurlock', 'set', 'out', 'see', 'how', ""'healthy"", 'eating', 'healthy', 'food', 'choices', 'smallest', 'sizes', 'Maybe', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'gained', 'weight', 'Maybe', 'would', 'have', ""n't"", 'vomited', 'stuffed', 'stomach', 'be', 'honest', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'show', 'positives', 'McDonalds.Fact', 'Eat', 'much', 'homemade', 'foods', 'three', 'times', 'day', 'will', 'probably', 'get', 'fat', 'unhealthy', 'Years', 'ate', 'health', 'food', 'store', 'same', 'high', 'fat', 'non-meat', 'vegetarian', 'choices', 'weekly', 'gained', 'weight', 'vegan', 'friend', 'gained', 'weight', 'when', 'ate', 'high', 'fat', 'foods', 'well.The', 'bottom', 'line', 'Moderation', 'do', ""n't"", 'choose', 'eat', 'McDonald', 'fries', 'hamburgers', 'etc', 'do', 'admit', 'occasion', 'eat', 'ice', 'cream', 'cone', 'lower', 'fat', 'most', 'ice', 'cream', 'food', 'choices', 'servings', 'are', 'much', 'more', 'French', 'mode.The', 'problem', ""n't"", 'McDonalds', 'food', 'as', 'much', 'Americans', 'pure', 'laziness', 'not', 'eat', 'time', 'pick', 'poor', 'food', 'choices', 'do', ""n't"", 'blame', 'alcohol', 'makers', 'drunk', 'driver', 'hitting', 'killing', 'husband', 'anymore', 'blame', 'fast', 'food', 'industry', 'Americans', 'becoming', 'fattest', 'people', 'developed', 'world.How', 'push', 'personal', 'responsibility', 'instead', 'what', 'Dr.', 'Carolyn', 'Myss', 'books', 'victimology']",N/A
770007,A2DGFOT7FB05WY,B0000B1OC4,BGP,"[0, 1]","While I wholeheartedly agree with Morgan Spurlock's overall critique of the fast food industry, Super Size Me is a calculated, stunt-based polemic, not an honest, straightforward documentary. If Spurlock had been committed to making a film of the latter nature, he would have structured it around a far more realistic premise (i.e., examining the effect that one--not three--fast food meals a day will have on the human body after a set period of time). In other words, while making the film, Spurlock should have considered the old Greek maxim, ""everything in moderation."" Indeed, the film would have been far more powerful (and, I would argue, for the general consumer, far more influential) if Spurlock had simply demonstrated the fact that fast food is nothing short of terrible for human beings when consumed in moderation. Sensationalism is great for both generating a dialog and increasing one's audience, but, at the same time, it leaves both the film and the thesis of the film itself far more vulnerable to criticism. As the film now stands, naysayers can easily write it off with any number of responses, including: ""the film doesn't apply to me, as I only have a few fast food meals a week""; ""if he had wanted to, he could have made the same case against eggs, butter or bacon""; and so on and so forth.",3,Regarding Super Size Me,1258329600,"11 16, 2009",2009,1314,"['wholeheartedly', 'agree', 'Morgan', 'Spurlock', 'overall', 'critique', 'fast', 'food', 'industry', 'Super', 'Size', 'Me', 'calculated', 'stunt-based', 'polemic', 'not', 'honest', 'straightforward', 'documentary', 'Spurlock', 'had', 'been', 'committed', 'making', 'film', 'latter', 'nature', 'would', 'have', 'structured', 'far', 'more', 'realistic', 'premise', 'i.e.', 'examining', 'effect', 'one', 'not', 'three', 'fast', 'food', 'meals', 'day', 'will', 'have', 'human', 'body', 'set', 'period', 'time', 'other', 'words', 'making', 'film', 'Spurlock', 'should', 'have', 'considered', 'old', 'Greek', 'maxim', 'everything', 'moderation', 'Indeed', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'far', 'more', 'powerful', 'would', 'argue', 'general', 'consumer', 'far', 'more', 'influential', 'Spurlock', 'had', 'simply', 'demonstrated', 'fact', 'fast', 'food', 'nothing', 'short', 'terrible', 'human', 'beings', 'when', 'consumed', 'moderation', 'Sensationalism', 'great', 'generating', 'dialog', 'increasing', 'one', 'audience', 'same', 'time', 'film', 'thesis', 'film', 'far', 'more', 'vulnerable', 'criticism', 'film', 'now', 'naysayers', 'can', 'easily', 'write', 'off', 'number', 'responses', 'including', 'film', ""n't"", 'apply', 'only', 'have', 'few', 'fast', 'food', 'meals', 'week', 'had', 'wanted', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'same', 'case', 'eggs', 'butter', 'bacon', 'so', 'so', 'forth']",N/A

One aspect that Spurlock does not even delve into in his film is the saddening fact that because McDonald's is so cheap, its menu is very affordable to the hard-working and poor people in this country. Yeah, it's healthier to make meals at home, but what are you going to do if you work 3 jobs to make ends meet and do not have the time or money to make or buy a healthy meal? It's mostly the poor people in this country who are stuck with McDonald's and of all people, they most certainly cannot afford to be on this diet especially since more than likely they do not have health care. Spurlock makes no mention of this. Instead, Spurlock has a condescending attitude towards fat people in general and doesn't offer much sympathy. It is just plain old rude and disrespectful to talk to anybody about their weight size. I also felt he should have interviewed stores such as Whole Foods and asked them why is it that they do not price their products such that good quality food can be afforded by everyone. I feel that they are equally at fault with McDonalds. Why shouldn't hard-working folks be able to afford good food? I also thought that Spurlock could have gone even further and examined the food found on the shelves at local supermarkets. If he had just gone down any aisle, pulling food down to examine labels, he would have found that most foods have sugar in it; it's not only McDonald's that puts sugar in most of their food. Even regular table salt has sugar in it. Is it any wonder, with all the sugar we are getting in common food items, that obesity and diabetes is a growing concern. Spurlock also seems to think that one has to be skinny to be healthy, which is not entirely true, and this image of beauty as a skinny person is damaging.Instead of attacking school cafeteria workers, who are only doing their jobs, making a living, he should have directed his interviews towards the people who have more of a say and are responsible for the decision making, such as school principals, the board of education, soda companies, the FDA, etc. etc. etc. And he should have visited a McDonald's abroad and see that they actually offer much more healthier options. When I went to a McDonald's in Italy, they offered actual packets of olive oil to put on a really healthy substantial salad. Why is it that the McDonald's abroad are healthier than here? Who made that decision?Spurlock's film seems more like an obnoxious juvenile dare, than an educated look at McDonald's, the very narrow means of obtaining good food in this country and the economics of it all. He does a good job showing the adverse effects of Mcdonald's, but he is only just starting to peel the orange. Equally juveniIe, I also really did not need to see his vomit, or learn about his sex life to get his point.

770012,A3SJ2VSCHZB18,B0000B1OC4,Brian Markowski,"[2, 2]","Like it's predecessor ""Fast Food Nation"", ""Super Size Me"" is a report on the fast food industry...most notably McDonalds. In this fast, funny and disgusting documentary, our narrator and human guinea pig, Morgan Spurlock commits to eating nothing but McDonalds food, three times a day, for one month. There are rules, he has to try everything on the menu at least once, he must ""super size"" if asked to do so, he can't eat it if it's not the McDonald's menu, and he must walk/exercise about that of a normal America (in this case, no exercise and around a mile of walking a day).In the beginning of the film Spurlock is examined by three doctors and is billed in very good health. Then he begins his experiment. Day one is great but by day 3 Spurlock is throwing up in parking lots. Once over the hump, he begins to eat in stride as his cholesterol goes up, his moods swing, his liver is threatened, and he begins to pack on the pounds. This alone would make an entertaining novelty of a documentary but ""Super Size Me"" also includes interviews with a man who eats hundreds of Big Macs a year, a PE program in Illinois that's changing how schools look at physical education, another school in Wisconsin that has a healthy alternative to school lunches, as well as interesting and often jaw dropping tidbits about how Americans eat today. Granted it's a bias report and Spurlock does jump to some unproven claims pretty quickly, one being that certain foods might be physically addicting; but overall, this is an eye opening look at not just fast food in America, but our health and this country's corporate greed.The DVD also has some informative extras.

Are they on every corner in every American city? SUPER SIZE ME is also about the marketing of fast food. The food, as McD's shows us on a daily basis, is secondary to that happy feeling we are supposed to get from the whole McDonaldland experience.

770014,A3JPFWKS83R49V,B0000B1OC4,"Bryan Carey ""Bryan Carey""","[9, 12]","Most everyone can agree that fast food is no substitute for fruits and vegetables. We all agree that it is mostly high in fat, calories, and sodium and that too much of it can add inches to the waistline and larger numbers to appear on the bathroom scale. This documentary tries to drive this point home by showing what happens to the human body after being subjected to ninety McDonald's meals over a period of thirty days.Morgan Spurlock is the man who sacrifices his body for this experiment and as the documentary moves forward, you can visibly see the effects this diet has had on his body. You also get to hear plenty of testimonials from health experts and others that eating in this manner is bad for the body. This should all be pretty common knowledge, but it is presented here like it is something brand new, and it is stated in a very exaggerated way. First of all, no one in their right mind would even think about eating ninety fast- food meals in one month, just like no one would consider eating ninety meals at ANY one restaurant over the course of one month. Thus, the experiment conducted here is unrealistic on its face. In addition, it is also unscientific and uncontrolled. What is shown are the effects on only one man, and therefore no definite conclusions can be drawn.What keeps this documentary entertaining is the humor, and Spurlock is the man behind most of it, dishing out funny one- liners as he goes about his month long mission to overindulge in food from the golden arches. He encounters a little bit of resistance from his vegetarian girlfriend and he gets ample warnings from health experts to stop what he is doing for his own good. But he ignores them all and continues all the way to the end, when his weight has increased by about 25 pounds and his body's percentage of fat has escalated several percentage points.I can respect Spurlock for wanting to prove his point. But there are many areas where this documentary just doesn't seem right. First of all, it is primarily aimed at McDonald's- a company made out to be an empire more evil than the former Soviet Union. Almost nothing is said about the other fast- food giants. Second, it makes occasional statements about the fast- food industry and American problems with obesity that are simplistic and false. In one scene for example, a lawyer tries to say that since fast- food wasn't very popular in the past when people were in better shape and since obesity is a more recent phenomenon, then fast- food must be the cause. This is incredibly ignorant, because it fails to take into account the countless other factors that have led to the epidemic of weight gain. It's a typical statement from a greedy, dishonest lawyer.Overall, though, this is still an acceptable documentary. It's a good public service piece and it does offer some good entertainment and funny one- liners. I wouldn't take it completely seriously, for the reasons stated above. But it does present some important considerations to make about fast- food and what it can do to your system if you overindulge.",3,Fast Food Mania,1104796800,"01 4, 2005",2005,3072,"['Most', 'everyone', 'can', 'agree', 'fast', 'food', 'substitute', 'fruits', 'vegetables', 'agree', 'mostly', 'high', 'fat', 'calories', 'sodium', 'too', 'much', 'can', 'add', 'inches', 'waistline', 'larger', 'numbers', 'appear', 'bathroom', 'scale', 'documentary', 'tries', 'drive', 'point', 'home', 'showing', 'what', 'human', 'body', 'being', 'subjected', 'ninety', 'McDonald', 'meals', 'period', 'thirty', 'days.Morgan', 'Spurlock', 'man', 'who', 'body', 'experiment', 'documentary', 'moves', 'forward', 'can', 'visibly', 'see', 'effects', 'diet', 'had', 'body', 'also', 'get', 'hear', 'plenty', 'testimonials', 'health', 'experts', 'others', 'eating', 'manner', 'bad', 'body', 'should', 'be', 'pretty', 'common', 'knowledge', 'presented', 'here', 'something', 'brand', 'new', 'stated', 'very', 'exaggerated', 'way', 'First', 'one', 'right', 'mind', 'would', 'even', 'think', 'eating', 'ninety', 'fast-', 'food', 'meals', 'one', 'month', 'just', 'one', 'would', 'consider', 'eating', 'ninety', 'meals', 'ANY', 'one', 'restaurant', 'course', 'one', 'month', 'Thus', 'experiment', 'conducted', 'here', 'unrealistic', 'face', 'addition', 'also', 'unscientific', 'uncontrolled', 'What', 'shown', 'are', 'effects', 'only', 'one', 'man', 'therefore', 'definite', 'conclusions', 'can', 'be', 'drawn.What', 'documentary', 'entertaining', 'humor', 'Spurlock', 'man', 'most', 'dishing', 'out', 'funny', 'one-', 'liners', 'month', 'long', 'mission', 'overindulge', 'food', 'golden', 'arches', 'little', 'bit', 'resistance', 'vegetarian', 'girlfriend', 'ample', 'warnings', 'health', 'experts', 'stop', 'what', 'doing', 'own', 'good', 'way', 'end', 'when', 'weight', 'increased', '25', 'pounds', 'body', 'percentage', 'fat', 'escalated', 'several', 'percentage', 'points.I', 'can', 'respect', 'Spurlock', 'wanting', 'prove', 'point', 'are', 'many', 'areas', 'where', 'documentary', 'just', ""n't"", 'seem', 'right', 'First', 'all', 'primarily', 'aimed', ""McDonald's-"", 'company', 'made', 'out', 'be', 'empire', 'more', 'evil', 'former', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'Almost', 'nothing', 'said', 'other', 'fast-', 'food', 'giants', 'Second', 'occasional', 'statements', 'fast-', 'food', 'industry', 'American', 'problems', 'obesity', 'are', 'simplistic', 'false', 'one', 'scene', 'example', 'lawyer', 'say', 'fast-', 'food', 'was', ""n't"", 'very', 'popular', 'past', 'when', 'people', 'were', 'better', 'shape', 'obesity', 'more', 'recent', 'phenomenon', 'then', 'fast-', 'food', 'must', 'be', 'cause', 'incredibly', 'ignorant', 'take', 'account', 'countless', 'other', 'factors', 'have', 'led', 'epidemic', 'weight', 'gain', 'typical', 'statement', 'greedy', 'dishonest', 'lawyer.Overall', 'though', 'still', 'acceptable', 'documentary', 'good', 'public', 'service', 'piece', 'offer', 'good', 'entertainment', 'funny', 'one-', 'liners', 'would', ""n't"", 'take', 'completely', 'seriously', 'reasons', 'stated', 'present', 'important', 'considerations', 'make', 'fast-', 'food', 'what', 'can', 'do', 'system', 'overindulge']",N/A

770017,A2E3F04ZK7FG66,B0000B1OC4,calvinnme,"[3, 4]","Morgan Spurlock's film is based on an experiment that uses himself as a guinea pig in which he ingests nothing but food and beverages sold by McDonald's for 30 days to see the results. Spurlock is a healthy man in his early 30's who - prior to this film - has eaten a healthy diet, maintained a healthy weight, and gotten plenty of exercise on a regular basis. He is embarking on this experiment because apparently McDonald's has made the claim that you could eat their food daily as part of a healthy diet. Spurlock's rules are he can eat nothing but McDonald's food for 30 days, he must eat three meals a day, and if asked if he wants to supersize something he must always say yes. On top of this, he simultaneously cuts back on his exercise to be something corresponding to what the average American gets. Also, though not part of his official rules, he never orders a salad or bottled water. He always goes right for the greasiest food offered. It should be obvious to anyone that this is not what McDonald's meant in their press release as Spurlock goes on a month long fast food binge. At least part of the results were not that startling to me. If you are over thirty and you do this to yourself, even for just a month, you should expect to gain a lot of weight and feel awful - which he does. He gains about ten percent of his original body weight over the month. What did surprise me was that the diet did so much damage to his internal organs so quickly. Spurlock's blood pressure shot up, he began to show signs of liver damage, and all of his blood tests frightened his doctor so much that he told him to go to the emergency room if he should begin to experience shooting pains in the middle of the night.Actually, Spurlock's experiment doesn't take up probably more than half the film. A large part of the documentary is spent talking about the state of nutrition in America, focusing particularly on the food served in the public schools. He visits several typical public schools in which kids can order anything they want at the cafeteria, have ready access to candy and soda via vending machines in the halls, and have greatly reduced physical education classes due to budget constraints and, although not mentioned, quite probably the greater emphasis on teaching to the standardized tests that students have to take in most states that takes up a great deal of school time. For contrast, Spurlock visits a school in Wisconsin for troubled kids in which organic food is served and notes that the behavior problems in these children is vastly reduced, most likely the result of this diet. This part of the film really made me think. I'm almost fifty, and when I was a child in public school we had to eat a balanced diet if we ordered one from the cafeteria, had limited access to desserts, and had no vending machines. There were no soft drinks served at lunch - only milk, iced tea, and water. Finally, we had daily P.E. classes in which we all had a period of mandatory calisthenics. I also remember that obese children were a rarity, and now if you look around they seem to be everywhere. Spurlock doesn't limit himself to examining the health habits of children, though. He also points out how the portion sizes in restaurants have grown tremendously and so have the waistlines of adults. Spurlock does come across one very interesting human oddity of an exception that proves the rule. This fellow has been eating an average of three Big Macs a day for years, is obviously in at least his late 30's or maybe even 40's, and is as thin as a rail. I'd love to find out if this behavior ever catches up with him.Basically, Spurlock's experiment on himself is used as a kind of Frankenstein horror tale to hold your interest while he talks about the crisis brewing in America from a combination of bad eating habits and greatly reduced physical activity. He doesn't seem to have any answers, though. People have to work longer hours to pay the bills, giving little time for exercise and home-cooked meals, and public education budgets have gotten tighter. The high price of housing has meant people with families live further from the center of cities in order to find affordable homes in safe neighborhoods and thus spend more time in traffic and less time walking. Since Spurlock himself is living the life of a single guy in New York City with no family pressures and can walk to the office every day, he would probably have a difficult job seeing that for many people just recognizing this problem isn't enough to solve it. However, it is a start.",4,Interesting film on the state of nutrition in America,1178323200,"05 5, 2007",2007,4568,"['Morgan', 'Spurlock', 'film', 'based', 'experiment', 'guinea', 'pig', 'nothing', 'food', 'beverages', 'sold', 'McDonald', '30', 'days', 'see', 'results', 'Spurlock', 'healthy', 'man', 'early', '30', 'who', 'prior', 'film', 'eaten', 'healthy', 'diet', 'maintained', 'healthy', 'weight', 'gotten', 'plenty', 'exercise', 'regular', 'basis', 'embarking', 'experiment', 'apparently', 'McDonald', 'made', 'claim', 'could', 'eat', 'food', 'daily', 'part', 'healthy', 'diet', 'Spurlock', 'rules', 'are', 'can', 'eat', 'nothing', 'McDonald', 'food', '30', 'days', 'must', 'eat', 'three', 'meals', 'day', 'asked', 'supersize', 'something', 'must', 'always', 'say', 'yes', 'top', 'simultaneously', 'back', 'exercise', 'be', 'something', 'corresponding', 'what', 'average', 'American', 'Also', 'not', 'part', 'official', 'rules', 'never', 'orders', 'salad', 'bottled', 'water', 'always', 'right', 'greasiest', 'food', 'offered', 'should', 'be', 'obvious', 'anyone', 'not', 'what', 'McDonald', 'meant', 'press', 'release', 'Spurlock', 'month', 'long', 'fast', 'food', 'binge', 'least', 'part', 'results', 'were', 'not', 'startling', 'are', 'thirty', 'do', 'even', 'just', 'month', 'should', 'expect', 'gain', 'lot', 'weight', 'feel', 'awful', 'gains', 'ten', 'percent', 'original', 'body', 'weight', 'month', 'What', 'did', 'surprise', 'was', 'diet', 'did', 'so', 'much', 'damage', 'internal', 'organs', 'so', 'quickly', 'Spurlock', 'blood', 'pressure', 'shot', 'up', 'began', 'show', 'signs', 'liver', 'damage', 'blood', 'tests', 'frightened', 'doctor', 'so', 'much', 'told', 'go', 'emergency', 'room', 'should', 'begin', 'experience', 'shooting', 'pains', 'middle', 'night.Actually', 'Spurlock', 'experiment', ""n't"", 'take', 'up', 'probably', 'more', 'film', 'large', 'part', 'documentary', 'spent', 'talking', 'state', 'nutrition', 'America', 'focusing', 'particularly', 'food', 'served', 'public', 'schools', 'several', 'typical', 'public', 'schools', 'kids', 'can', 'order', 'anything', 'want', 'cafeteria', 'have', 'ready', 'access', 'candy', 'soda', 'vending', 'machines', 'halls', 'have', 'greatly', 'reduced', 'physical', 'education', 'classes', 'due', 'budget', 'constraints', 'not', 'mentioned', 'quite', 'probably', 'greater', 'emphasis', 'teaching', 'standardized', 'tests', 'students', 'have', 'take', 'most', 'states', 'up', 'great', 'deal', 'school', 'time', 'contrast', 'Spurlock', 'school', 'Wisconsin', 'troubled', 'kids', 'organic', 'food', 'served', 'notes', 'behavior', 'problems', 'children', 'vastly', 'reduced', 'most', 'likely', 'result', 'diet', 'part', 'film', 'really', 'made', 'think', ""'m"", 'almost', 'fifty', 'when', 'was', 'child', 'public', 'school', 'had', 'eat', 'balanced', 'diet', 'ordered', 'one', 'cafeteria', 'had', 'limited', 'access', 'desserts', 'had', 'vending', 'machines', 'were', 'soft', 'drinks', 'served', 'lunch', 'only', 'milk', 'iced', 'tea', 'water', 'Finally', 'had', 'daily', 'P.E', 'classes', 'had', 'period', 'mandatory', 'calisthenics', 'also', 'remember', 'obese', 'children', 'were', 'rarity', 'now', 'look', 'seem', 'be', 'everywhere', 'Spurlock', ""n't"", 'limit', 'examining', 'health', 'habits', 'children', 'though', 'also', 'out', 'how', 'portion', 'restaurants', 'have', 'grown', 'tremendously', 'so', 'have', 'waistlines', 'adults', 'Spurlock', 'come', 'one', 'very', 'interesting', 'human', 'oddity', 'exception', 'rule', 'fellow', 'been', 'eating', 'average', 'three', 'Big', 'Macs', 'day', 'years', 'obviously', 'least', 'late', '30', 'maybe', 'even', '40', 'as', 'thin', 'rail', ""'d"", 'love', 'find', 'out', 'behavior', 'ever', 'up', 'him.Basically', 'Spurlock', 'experiment', 'used', 'kind', 'Frankenstein', 'horror', 'tale', 'hold', 'interest', 'crisis', 'brewing', 'America', 'combination', 'bad', 'eating', 'habits', 'greatly', 'reduced', 'physical', 'activity', ""n't"", 'seem', 'have', 'answers', 'though', 'People', 'have', 'work', 'longer', 'hours', 'pay', 'bills', 'giving', 'little', 'time', 'exercise', 'home-cooked', 'meals', 'public', 'education', 'budgets', 'have', 'gotten', 'tighter', 'high', 'price', 'housing', 'meant', 'people', 'families', 'live', 'further', 'center', 'cities', 'order', 'find', 'affordable', 'homes', 'safe', 'neighborhoods', 'thus', 'spend', 'more', 'time', 'traffic', 'less', 'time', 'walking', 'Spurlock', 'living', 'life', 'single', 'guy', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'family', 'pressures', 'can', 'walk', 'office', 'day', 'would', 'probably', 'have', 'difficult', 'job', 'seeing', 'many', 'people', 'just', 'recognizing', 'problem', ""n't"", 'enough', 'solve', 'However', 'start']",N/A

Despite this being an indie film, the quality of the editing and the camerawork is much higher than I thought they were gonna be.3.

This was unexpected.4.  I thought the way Spurlock phrased a lot of his interview questions was just a way of ""leading"" responses, thereby rendering his ""data"" useless.  An example of this would be when he asked everybody:  ""How often should one eat fast food.""  Should?  Like it's positively healthy for you?  Like it's an essential and irreplaceable part of one's diet?  Not even McDonald's would have claimed that.  A more neutral phrasing of this would have been:  ""How often do you think one can eat fast food and remain healthy?""

770023,A1NZRSRYA1WGPO,B0000B1OC4,Cayuga,"[2, 3]","I am very interested in the impact of McDonald's food on human health for a variety of reasons.  For the purposes of scientific inquiry, Morgan Spurlock didn't do the job of illuminating the effects of McDonald's as well as he could have.  He threw variables in the mix that could have caused his resulting adverse health effects, like drastically cutting his activity level and doubling his caloric intake per day.I would liked to have seen the outcome of an exclusively McDonald's diet if Spurlock had continued his normal daily activity level, and not engaged in the binging he forced on himself (the ""Supersized"" meals.)  I realize the movie would not have been as dramatic if he had incurred only modest increases in weight, cholesterol and liver-stress indicators.  But it would have been more interesting to the nutritionally-curious and more valid as a scientific study.A remarkable note at the end of the film is that the ""Big Mac guy,"" who eats hundreds of them a year, only has a cholesterol level of 140.  That is an exceptionally low level! Spurlocks' cholesterol went up during his experiment, most likely due to the quantity of trans fats he was consuming. These are present in high levels in McDonald's fried foods like French fries and chicken nuggets.I am not advocating eating Big Macs or other hamburgers every day, but they are probably the most benign foods on McDonald's menus. Dietary cholesterol, like that in red meat, is not the villain it is presented to be. Actually it is trans fats which cause so much cardiovascular harm.  The McDonald's foods cooked in trans fats increase triglycerides, lead to increases in bad cholesterol and the lowering of good cholesterol, and contribute to artery hardening. In addition to the trans fats in their fries and chicken nuggets, there are unhealthy fats in McDonald's breakfast foods: the biscuits, hotcakes and the liquid margarines they use to cook in.Another misleading aspect of the film is that they showed large bags of sugar for shock effect, indicating what Spurlock was consuming these.  Don't the filmmakers and featured dieticians in the film know that cane sugar is a rare ingredient in processed food these days?  High fructose corn syrup is the sweetener in McDonald's sodas, ice-cream, and sweetened pastries.  Studies show that high fructose corn syrup is very damaging to the liver, and causes insulin resistance, much more so than cane or beet sugar.Declines in Spurlock's health over the month span were most likely caused by lack of exercise, a dramatic increase in calorie consumption, as well as eating a diet high in trans fats and high fructose corn syrup.  But we will never know which of those is the bigger factor from this experiment.The film is very entertaining and also contains good information about the grocery industry lobby, overly-processed school lunches and the increase in obesity in the U.S.  What Spurlock didn't touch on, and a big factor in the obesity trend, is that people are so rushed that they don't have time to cook.  U.S economic productivity has gone way up since his childhood in the 1960s-70s. (Wages have stagnated at the same time.) People are working more hours, they are more rushed than ever and our bodies are paying a price.",4,Unscientific but still has merits,1193270400,"10 25, 2007",2007,3255,"['am', 'very', 'interested', 'impact', 'McDonald', 'food', 'human', 'health', 'variety', 'reasons', 'purposes', 'scientific', 'inquiry', 'Morgan', 'Spurlock', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'job', 'illuminating', 'effects', 'McDonald', 'as', 'well', 'could', 'have', 'threw', 'variables', 'mix', 'could', 'have', 'caused', 'resulting', 'adverse', 'health', 'effects', 'drastically', 'cutting', 'activity', 'level', 'doubling', 'caloric', 'intake', 'day.I', 'would', 'liked', 'have', 'seen', 'outcome', 'exclusively', 'McDonald', 'diet', 'Spurlock', 'had', 'continued', 'normal', 'daily', 'activity', 'level', 'not', 'engaged', 'binging', 'forced', 'Supersized', 'meals', 'realize', 'movie', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'dramatic', 'had', 'incurred', 'only', 'modest', 'increases', 'weight', 'cholesterol', 'liver-stress', 'indicators', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'interesting', 'nutritionally-curious', 'more', 'valid', 'scientific', 'study.A', 'remarkable', 'note', 'end', 'film', 'Big', 'Mac', 'guy', 'who', 'eats', 'hundreds', 'year', 'only', 'cholesterol', 'level', '140', 'exceptionally', 'low', 'level', 'Spurlocks', 'cholesterol', 'went', 'up', 'experiment', 'most', 'likely', 'due', 'quantity', 'trans', 'fats', 'was', 'consuming', 'are', 'present', 'high', 'levels', 'McDonald', 'fried', 'foods', 'French', 'fries', 'chicken', 'nuggets.I', 'am', 'not', 'advocating', 'eating', 'Big', 'Macs', 'other', 'hamburgers', 'day', 'are', 'probably', 'most', 'benign', 'foods', 'McDonald', 'menus', 'Dietary', 'cholesterol', 'red', 'meat', 'not', 'villain', 'presented', 'be', 'Actually', 'trans', 'fats', 'cause', 'so', 'much', 'cardiovascular', 'harm', 'McDonald', 'foods', 'cooked', 'trans', 'fats', 'increase', 'triglycerides', 'lead', 'increases', 'bad', 'cholesterol', 'lowering', 'good', 'cholesterol', 'contribute', 'artery', 'hardening', 'addition', 'trans', 'fats', 'fries', 'chicken', 'nuggets', 'are', 'unhealthy', 'fats', 'McDonald', 'breakfast', 'foods', 'biscuits', 'hotcakes', 'liquid', 'margarines', 'use', 'cook', 'in.Another', 'misleading', 'aspect', 'film', 'showed', 'large', 'bags', 'sugar', 'shock', 'effect', 'indicating', 'what', 'Spurlock', 'was', 'consuming', 'Do', ""n't"", 'filmmakers', 'featured', 'dieticians', 'film', 'know', 'cane', 'sugar', 'rare', 'ingredient', 'processed', 'food', 'days', 'High', 'fructose', 'corn', 'syrup', 'sweetener', 'McDonald', 'sodas', 'ice-cream', 'sweetened', 'pastries', 'Studies', 'show', 'high', 'fructose', 'corn', 'syrup', 'very', 'damaging', 'liver', 'insulin', 'resistance', 'much', 'more', 'so', 'cane', 'beet', 'sugar.Declines', 'Spurlock', 'health', 'month', 'span', 'were', 'most', 'likely', 'caused', 'lack', 'exercise', 'dramatic', 'increase', 'calorie', 'consumption', 'as', 'well', 'eating', 'diet', 'high', 'trans', 'fats', 'high', 'fructose', 'corn', 'syrup', 'will', 'never', 'know', 'bigger', 'factor', 'experiment.The', 'film', 'very', 'entertaining', 'also', 'good', 'information', 'grocery', 'industry', 'lobby', 'overly-processed', 'school', 'lunches', 'increase', 'obesity', 'U.S.', 'What', 'Spurlock', 'did', ""n't"", 'touch', 'big', 'factor', 'obesity', 'trend', 'people', 'are', 'so', 'rushed', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'time', 'cook', 'U.S', 'economic', 'productivity', 'gone', 'way', 'childhood', '1960s-70s', 'Wages', 'have', 'stagnated', 'same', 'time', 'People', 'are', 'working', 'more', 'hours', 'are', 'more', 'rushed', 'ever', 'bodies', 'are', 'paying', 'price']",N/A

770026,A2O39VY1UEDCKH,B0000B1OC4,Charles Jannuzi,"[1, 2]","With this 'notorious' film, Morgan Spurlock joins Michael Moore in making documentaries that are informative, thought-provoking, personal, controversial and commercially successful. I wish more people would understand that next-to-last term, controversial. It is what gets more documentaries like this made because it is what gets people to view documentaries like this.The film is really an inter-twining of two lines of development: (1) the gimmick of eating nothing but McD's meals for a month and (2) a fact-based approach to an argument over the influence of the food industry combined with American's bad food choices, all of which amounts to an epidemic of obesity and bad health.As for (1), many have picked up right away that Spurlock is stacking the deck in favor of him gaining weight rapidly by eating so many french fries, large sandwiches, and sugary softdrinks (which are enormous, the likes of which we don't see here in Japan, yet). I argue it is the fries and high-fructose corn syrup in the drinks that really make his experimental diet so awful. And yet people are missing the points he makes with such choices: Yes, many people do go to McD's and eat like this, day after day. For on thing, the menu is so limited, and there is very little 'green' food on it. Also, McD's actually promoted super-sized meals to improve their financial bottom line--they are more profitable. And even if you don't choose large sizes, the company promotes sets, which automatically make you buy a profitable sandwhich, an even more profitable order of fries, and an even yet more profitable soft drink.Moreover, substituting aspartame- and sucralose-laden diet drinks might be even more risky for your health. Finally, by the middle of the film we see the film-maker is headed into big trouble with this McD's diet, and yet by the end of the film, as bad as things got, he still looks like he is in better shape than most of America. One more note, some have also pointed out the unfairness of him eliminating most exercise except necessary walking, but again they miss the point: many Americans get almost no exercise, and it is the people who live in the rural and suburban areas who get the least, which is helping to cause the obesity epidemic among these people. Moreover, the guy is also making the argument that a diet like this will make you feel so awful, you won't have the energy to exercise.Now about the (2) line of development--the expose' of the food industry and the bad food choices Americans face and give in to. I wish he had expanded it even more because clearly he, his small crew and their limited resources did a better job than anything you are going to see from CNN and Dr. Gupta! If you combine this film with 'King Corn', you can learn an awful lot about what is actually going on. I wish Michael Moore had added material like this to 'Sicko', since one reason why so many Americans are sick is the bad diet over many years.This film is definitely worth watching, and we should be glad that it has drawn so much attention to the problems of food and obesity, not just in America, but in the developed and affluent parts of the developing world (more and more people are eating like and looking like Americans, and that is not good). I'd like to see someone make a film about using food stamps and shopping for food in a poor neighborhood of an major urban area--combined with a small town somewhere.

I sure wouldn't want to try and make that case, but I also don't believe that Spurlock himself would claim that this constitutes in any way sound science.  It is more a case of, ""I know that embarking on an all-McDonald's, all-the-time diet cannot possibly be good for me, but just how bad could the results actually be?""  Fair enough --- the most that can be said is that results may vary, from person to person.  Ironically, Spurlock's relatively good health in many ways made him more susceptible to catastrophic changes in his body.  Mood swings?  Anybody who exercises for a few hours every day can attest to how crappy one feels if one misses even one workout.  In other words, the healthier your body is, the more finely-tuned it is, and the more extremely it will react to a radical change in diet and lifestyle.  This change, everyone will agree, was pretty damned radical.Spurlock's detractors have latched on a few of the more obvious flaws --- for example, a 5000 calorie-per-day diet, no matter what type of food, is destined to produce disastrous results --- to brand the entire documentary as being hopelessly slanted and therefore of no value whatsoever.  One has to suspect the motives of some detractors.  If one puts the obvious flaws in their proper perspective, one can better appreciate the very valid observations Spurlock makes.How unfair it is for Spurlock to single out McDonald's, say the critics, as though Spurlock is carrying some sort of hateful McGrudge against this particular fast food purveyor.  To be fair, Spurlock does mention other fast food chains (and can Baskin Robbins even really be lumped into fast food?), but let's face it --- McDonald's is the proverbial 800-pound gorilla of the fast food industry.  How can one argue that McDonald's does not set the gold standard when it comes to fast-food marketing strategies?The examination of these marketing strategies are to me the best sections of the movie, and should make one's blood run cold.  When one realizes just how thoroughly indoctrinated American children are (they instantly recognize Ronald McDonald while --- at best --- finding George Washington's image to be vaguely familiar), one better appreciates how it must have been to have lost one's children to the doctrines of China's Cultural Revolution.  It is almost cultlike in nature.  When one couples that with the almost wholesale adoption by the public school system of pre-fab high-fat food (not because it saves money, but simply because it is quicker to prepare), one wonders how any child in the US hasn't needed a coronary bypass operation by the time they graduate.  Suffice it to say, Spurlock makes a pretty compelling case for how one's environment creates some pretty god-awful eating habits among children without the kids (or the parents sometimes) even realizing it.  Spurlock demonstrates that it isn't quite as simple as saying that it is only an issue of will power, or lack thereof.Yes, this movie can get pretty gross --- anything that involves Chicken McNuggets should have an advisory warning, in my opinion --- but by and large it is both entertaining and informative.  Although Spurlock takes fast food eating habits to their logical extremes, he does have plenty of valid points, and will make you think a little more carefully about what you choose to put in your body.",5,"Even with its flaws, very much worth watching",1105401600,"01 11, 2005",2005,3465,"['Can', 'anyone', 'make', 'cogent', 'argument', 'Morgan', 'Spurlock', 'self-abusive', 'experiment', 'sound', 'science', 'sure', 'would', ""n't"", 'want', 'try', 'make', 'case', 'also', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'Spurlock', 'would', 'claim', 'way', 'sound', 'science', 'more', 'case', 'know', 'embarking', 'all-McDonald', 'all-the-time', 'diet', 'can', 'not', 'possibly', 'be', 'good', 'just', 'how', 'bad', 'could', 'results', 'actually', 'be', 'Fair', 'enough', 'most', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'results', 'may', 'vary', 'person', 'person', 'Ironically', 'Spurlock', 'relatively', 'good', 'health', 'many', 'ways', 'made', 'more', 'susceptible', 'catastrophic', 'changes', 'body', 'Mood', 'swings', 'Anybody', 'who', 'few', 'hours', 'day', 'can', 'attest', 'how', 'crappy', 'one', 'feels', 'one', 'even', 'one', 'workout', 'other', 'words', 'healthier', 'body', 'more', 'finely-tuned', 'more', 'extremely', 'will', 'react', 'radical', 'change', 'diet', 'lifestyle', 'change', 'everyone', 'will', 'agree', 'was', 'pretty', 'damned', 'radical.Spurlock', 'detractors', 'have', 'latched', 'few', 'more', 'obvious', 'flaws', 'example', '5000', 'calorie-per-day', 'diet', 'matter', 'what', 'type', 'food', 'destined', 'produce', 'disastrous', 'results', 'brand', 'entire', 'documentary', 'being', 'hopelessly', 'slanted', 'therefore', 'value', 'whatsoever', 'One', 'suspect', 'motives', 'detractors', 'one', 'obvious', 'flaws', 'proper', 'perspective', 'one', 'can', 'better', 'appreciate', 'very', 'valid', 'observations', 'Spurlock', 'makes.How', 'unfair', 'Spurlock', 'single', 'out', 'McDonald', 'say', 'critics', 'Spurlock', 'carrying', 'sort', 'hateful', 'McGrudge', 'particular', 'fast', 'food', 'purveyor', 'be', 'fair', 'Spurlock', 'mention', 'other', 'fast', 'food', 'chains', 'can', 'Baskin', 'Robbins', 'even', 'really', 'be', 'lumped', 'fast', 'food', 'let', 'face', 'McDonald', 'proverbial', '800-pound', 'gorilla', 'fast', 'food', 'industry', 'How', 'can', 'one', 'argue', 'McDonald', 'not', 'set', 'gold', 'standard', 'when', 'fast-food', 'marketing', 'strategies', 'examination', 'marketing', 'strategies', 'are', 'best', 'sections', 'movie', 'should', 'make', 'one', 'blood', 'run', 'cold', 'When', 'one', 'just', 'how', 'thoroughly', 'indoctrinated', 'American', 'children', 'are', 'instantly', 'recognize', 'Ronald', 'McDonald', 'best', 'finding', 'George', 'Washington', 'image', 'be', 'vaguely', 'familiar', 'one', 'better', 'how', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'have', 'lost', 'one', 'children', 'doctrines', 'China', 'Cultural', 'Revolution', 'almost', 'cultlike', 'nature', 'When', 'one', 'almost', 'wholesale', 'adoption', 'public', 'school', 'system', 'pre-fab', 'high-fat', 'food', 'not', 'money', 'simply', 'quicker', 'prepare', 'one', 'how', 'child', 'US', ""n't"", 'needed', 'coronary', 'bypass', 'operation', 'time', 'graduate', 'Suffice', 'say', 'Spurlock', 'pretty', 'compelling', 'case', 'how', 'one', 'environment', 'pretty', 'god-awful', 'eating', 'habits', 'children', 'kids', 'parents', 'sometimes', 'even', 'realizing', 'Spurlock', ""n't"", 'quite', 'as', 'simple', 'saying', 'only', 'issue', 'will', 'power', 'lack', 'thereof.Yes', 'movie', 'can', 'get', 'pretty', 'gross', 'anything', 'Chicken', 'McNuggets', 'should', 'have', 'advisory', 'warning', 'opinion', 'large', 'entertaining', 'informative', 'Spurlock', 'fast', 'food', 'eating', 'habits', 'logical', 'extremes', 'have', 'plenty', 'valid', 'points', 'will', 'make', 'think', 'little', 'more', 'carefully', 'what', 'choose', 'put', 'body']",N/A

Anyway, the thing that makes this documentary so biased is the fact that it gets you to try and hate the fast food industry and blame our obesity on them. Now listen, I have a few very simple solutions to get rid of your obesity. Number one - Ever hear of a thing called moderation? Yeah, People, control what and how much you eat! It is a very simple thing. If you eat fast food more than 3 or 4 times a month, you need to eat less. I eat fast food about 1 time a month. Sometimes 2, but usually one, and I am not obese at all. So that is one solution which I beleive makes perfect sense. Number two - EXCERSIZE!! Ever heard of it. 30 minutes of excersize a day at least. It even said so in the movie!But aside from all the biased opinions by some people, namely, Morgan Spurlocks girlfriend, who is a vegetarian, this movie is very interesting. I hate vegetarians, because like I said before, too much of anything isn't good for you. I would like to give you all a challenge. Anybody who is going to write a reveiw after this one, please, tell me one thing you can do so much that it won't have any negative side effects at all. Please, tell me. You can't. There isn't such a thing.Aside from all that, the movie is very interesting, and makes some good points and has facts to back it up. For instance, I was very suprised when those little kids were asked to say if they knew who a certain figure was in a picture. I was suprised when they didn't know who Jesus was, but they knew about Ronald Mcdonald. That is a very disturbing fact! The rest of the movie basically captures Morgan in his quest to survive eating nothing but fast food for a whole month, all the while consulting physicians and showing very serious side effects. However, how many people actually eat McDonalds for breakfast, lunch, and dinner for 30 days? Nobody, really. So, to say that these side effects will happen to you if you eat McDonalds is a bunch of bulls**t. So overall, the movie is interesting and kind of educational, and you might actually enjoy watching it, despite the physicians saying you should never ever eat fast food. I wouldn't necessarily recommend it as entertainment, but if you ever needed something to make you self concious and stop eating all that fast food, then this is the movie for you!",3,"A Very Biased Opinion of the Fast Food Industry, but Interesting Nontheless.",1122336000,"07 26, 2005",2005,2582,"['Actually', 'extremely', 'hard', 'find', 'good', 'documentary', ""n't"", 'biased', 'Fahrenheit', '9/11', 'would', 'be', 'perfect', 'example', 'BTW', 'hate', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'Now', 'love', 'fast', 'food', 'like', 'Mcdonalds', 'favorite', 'n', 'Out', 'Yeah', 'big', 'fast', 'food', 'restaurant', 'here', 'California', 'Anyway', 'thing', 'documentary', 'so', 'biased', 'fact', 'try', 'hate', 'fast', 'food', 'industry', 'blame', 'obesity', 'Now', 'have', 'few', 'very', 'simple', 'solutions', 'get', 'rid', 'obesity', 'Number', 'one', 'Ever', 'hear', 'thing', 'called', 'moderation', 'Yeah', 'People', 'control', 'what', 'how', 'much', 'eat', 'very', 'simple', 'thing', 'eat', 'fast', 'food', 'more', '3', '4', 'times', 'month', 'need', 'eat', 'less', 'eat', 'fast', 'food', '1', 'time', 'month', 'Sometimes', '2', 'usually', 'one', 'am', 'not', 'obese', 'one', 'solution', 'beleive', 'perfect', 'sense', 'Number', 'two', 'EXCERSIZE', 'Ever', 'heard', '30', 'minutes', 'excersize', 'day', 'least', 'even', 'said', 'so', 'movie', 'aside', 'biased', 'opinions', 'people', 'namely', 'Morgan', 'Spurlocks', 'girlfriend', 'who', 'vegetarian', 'movie', 'very', 'interesting', 'hate', 'vegetarians', 'said', 'too', 'much', 'anything', ""n't"", 'good', 'would', 'like', 'give', 'challenge', 'Anybody', 'who', 'going', 'write', 'reveiw', 'one', 'please', 'tell', 'one', 'thing', 'can', 'do', 'so', 'much', 'wo', ""n't"", 'have', 'negative', 'side', 'effects', 'Please', 'tell', 'ca', ""n't"", ""n't"", 'such', 'thing.Aside', 'movie', 'very', 'interesting', 'good', 'points', 'facts', 'back', 'up', 'instance', 'was', 'very', 'suprised', 'when', 'little', 'kids', 'were', 'asked', 'say', 'knew', 'who', 'certain', 'figure', 'was', 'picture', 'was', 'suprised', 'when', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'who', 'Jesus', 'was', 'knew', 'Ronald', 'Mcdonald', 'very', 'disturbing', 'fact', 'rest', 'movie', 'basically', 'Morgan', 'quest', 'survive', 'eating', 'nothing', 'fast', 'food', 'whole', 'month', 'while', 'consulting', 'physicians', 'showing', 'very', 'serious', 'side', 'effects', 'However', 'how', 'many', 'people', 'actually', 'eat', 'McDonalds', 'breakfast', 'lunch', 'dinner', '30', 'days', 'Nobody', 'really', 'So', 'say', 'side', 'effects', 'will', 'happen', 'eat', 'McDonalds', 'bunch', 'bulls**t.', 'So', 'overall', 'movie', 'interesting', 'kind', 'educational', 'might', 'actually', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'physicians', 'saying', 'should', 'never', 'ever', 'eat', 'fast', 'food', 'would', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'recommend', 'entertainment', 'ever', 'needed', 'something', 'make', 'concious', 'stop', 'eating', 'fast', 'food', 'then', 'movie']",N/A
770030,A2X8KN82L07RSK,B0000B1OC4,C. Johnson,"[15, 18]","This is a very good documentary in which Morgan decides to take on the task of eating nothing but fast food for 30 days to see just how bad it is for his body.  The results should not surprise you, he gained over 20 pounds and many of his internal organs suffered severe damage.During his 30 days, he makes a lot of valid points about how the food industry, fast food in particular is only out to make profit because they are in fact a business.  They care nothing about the consumer other than what in their wallets.  They purposely make their food addictive to keep people coming back.  This starts a chain reaction in which people get fatter and fatter which means they will eat even more the next time.  While he targeted McDonald's in this movie, almost all fast food chains are guilty of the same thing.Morgan tried 20+ times to get in contact with executives at McDonald's, but it always seemed that they were in meetings and they NEVER returned any of this calls.  What are they trying to hide?  Its painfully obvious that they know what their food is doing to America, and that they are a main contributor to obesity in this country.  But what do they care right?  They are in the business to make money; and making food that is severely affecting people's health and literally killing them is not of a concern to them.As bad as the fast food execs are, people are to blame as well.  Who keeps them in business; the people who buy their food everyday.  Either they don't care what they are doing to their bodies or honestly don't know of the dangers.  I also found it very interesting that a particular group of people Morgan interviewed didn't know the pledge of allegiance but could recite the McDonald's Big Mac theme song word for word; and people wonder why we have a huge obesity problem.Morgan did a very good job in not offending the obese people in this movie.  If I were making the movie I probably would not have been so kind.  Fat people can blame the fast food corporations and other food companies all they want, and granted while some of the blame can definitely be placed there, the main problem lies within themselves.  They are not forced to eat unhealthy foods, yet they choose to anyway.  And then they complain about how fat they are and why they are sick and tired all the time.  Yes there are always exceptions (people with thyroid problems, etc).  But for the people that do not have these medical conditions, they should look in the mirror because its their problem and their fault, not anyone elses.  None of these places put guns to their head and forces them to eat the food.  Yet its funny how they can blame everyone but themselves for something they have control over.  It really makes no sense to me....at all.  Then to top it all off, they turn around and get gastric bypass surgery because they have no self control or discipline, if that's not bad enough, their insurance covers it!For me I made the decision a long time before this movie came out to no longer constantly fill my body with the artery clogging, fat filled, grease laden crap that fast food restaurants serve or drink teeth melting, sugary sodas.  My fast food visits are no more than once or twice per YEAR, and the last time I ate anything from a fast food restaurant was over 11 months ago at a Wendy's, and even then I shared the meal with my wife.  I haven't been to McDonald's in over 12 years and between them and Hardees they are the absolute worse out of the bunch.  I guarantee you will NEVER catch me in a McDonald's ever again.  I even get a little queezy when I see their commericals on TV.Morgan tells it like it is, and leaves the choice up to the viewer if they want to decide to change their eating habits.  Unfortunately, many obese people will just say this is a good movie and then continue right on eating crap from fast food making themselves sicker and sicker.  Only when they are on the operating table being preped for open heart surgery will they realize what they have done to their body.",4,"He tells it like it is, and leaves the decision up to you.",1124928000,"08 25, 2005",2005,4024,"['very', 'good', 'documentary', 'Morgan', 'take', 'task', 'eating', 'nothing', 'fast', 'food', '30', 'days', 'see', 'just', 'how', 'bad', 'body', 'results', 'should', 'not', 'surprise', 'gained', 'over', '20', 'pounds', 'many', 'internal', 'organs', 'suffered', 'severe', 'damage.During', '30', 'days', 'lot', 'valid', 'points', 'how', 'food', 'industry', 'fast', 'food', 'particular', 'only', 'out', 'make', 'profit', 'are', 'fact', 'business', 'care', 'nothing', 'consumer', 'other', 'what', 'wallets', 'purposely', 'make', 'food', 'addictive', 'keep', 'people', 'coming', 'back', 'chain', 'reaction', 'people', 'get', 'fatter', 'fatter', 'will', 'eat', 'even', 'more', 'next', 'time', 'targeted', 'McDonald', 'movie', 'almost', 'fast', 'food', 'chains', 'are', 'guilty', 'same', 'thing.Morgan', 'tried', '20+', 'times', 'get', 'contact', 'executives', 'McDonald', 'always', 'seemed', 'were', 'meetings', 'NEVER', 'returned', 'What', 'are', 'trying', 'hide', 'painfully', 'obvious', 'know', 'what', 'food', 'doing', 'America', 'are', 'main', 'contributor', 'obesity', 'country', 'what', 'do', 'care', 'right', 'are', 'business', 'make', 'money', 'making', 'food', 'severely', 'affecting', 'people', 'health', 'literally', 'killing', 'not', 'concern', 'them.As', 'bad', 'fast', 'food', 'execs', 'are', 'people', 'are', 'blame', 'as', 'well', 'Who', 'business', 'people', 'who', 'buy', 'food', 'everyday', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'what', 'are', 'doing', 'bodies', 'honestly', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'dangers', 'also', 'found', 'very', 'interesting', 'particular', 'group', 'people', 'Morgan', 'interviewed', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'pledge', 'allegiance', 'could', 'recite', 'McDonald', 'Big', 'Mac', 'theme', 'song', 'word', 'word', 'people', 'wonder', 'why', 'have', 'huge', 'obesity', 'problem.Morgan', 'did', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'not', 'offending', 'obese', 'people', 'movie', 'were', 'making', 'movie', 'probably', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'kind', 'Fat', 'people', 'can', 'blame', 'fast', 'food', 'corporations', 'other', 'food', 'companies', 'want', 'granted', 'blame', 'can', 'definitely', 'be', 'placed', 'there', 'main', 'problem', 'are', 'not', 'forced', 'eat', 'unhealthy', 'foods', 'yet', 'choose', 'anyway', 'then', 'complain', 'how', 'fat', 'are', 'why', 'are', 'sick', 'tired', 'time', 'are', 'always', 'exceptions', 'people', 'thyroid', 'problems', 'etc', 'people', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'medical', 'conditions', 'should', 'look', 'mirror', 'problem', 'fault', 'not', 'anyone', 'elses', 'None', 'places', 'put', 'guns', 'head', 'eat', 'food', 'funny', 'how', 'can', 'blame', 'everyone', 'something', 'have', 'control', 'really', 'sense', 'Then', 'top', 'off', 'turn', 'around', 'get', 'gastric', 'bypass', 'surgery', 'have', 'self', 'control', 'discipline', 'not', 'bad', 'enough', 'insurance', 'made', 'decision', 'long', 'time', 'movie', 'came', 'out', 'longer', 'constantly', 'fill', 'body', 'artery', 'clogging', 'fat', 'filled', 'grease', 'laden', 'crap', 'fast', 'food', 'restaurants', 'serve', 'drink', 'melting', 'sugary', 'sodas', 'fast', 'food', 'visits', 'are', 'more', 'once', 'twice', 'YEAR', 'last', 'time', 'ate', 'anything', 'fast', 'food', 'restaurant', 'was', '11', 'months', 'ago', 'Wendy', 'even', 'then', 'shared', 'meal', 'wife', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'McDonald', '12', 'years', 'Hardees', 'are', 'absolute', 'worse', 'bunch', 'guarantee', 'will', 'NEVER', 'catch', 'McDonald', 'ever', 'again', 'even', 'get', 'little', 'queezy', 'when', 'see', 'commericals', 'TV.Morgan', 'choice', 'up', 'viewer', 'want', 'decide', 'change', 'eating', 'habits', 'Unfortunately', 'many', 'obese', 'people', 'will', 'just', 'say', 'good', 'movie', 'then', 'continue', 'right', 'eating', 'crap', 'fast', 'food', 'making', 'sicker', 'sicker', 'Only', 'when', 'are', 'operating', 'table', 'being', 'preped', 'open', 'heart', 'surgery', 'will', 'realize', 'what', 'have', 'done', 'body']",N/A
770031,A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B0000B1OC4,"Cloud ""...""","[0, 0]","I'll admit that I have eaten a bit more than my share of McDonalds than is recommended. Most of it came from a lack of transportation to get home and I walk by 2 McDonalds to get home, literally one right across the street from the other. After awhile, I stopped going; mainly from lack of spending money but also I felt I was getting a bit too ""familiar"" with the staff. Then just by chance, my aunt says she watched this movie and if I've seen it. Of course now the idea's in the brain and I just have to see it. Don't think I'm going back there no more. In fact, if another guy wanted to do a movie going after KFC, A&W; and Boston Pizza, then I'm set.Filmmaker Morgan Spurlock, inspired by 2 obese girls suing McDonalds for saying they made them fat, tries an experiment: does food from the restaurant really deteriorate your health or is McDonalds claim that their food is not harmful actually valid? The premise is simple: 3 square meals a day (breakfast, lunch, supper) for 30 days, he has to have everything on the menu once before he's finished and if an employee asks him to ""super-size"", he must do so, and he can not have anything else other than what McDonalds serves. With the help of 3 trained medical doctors and his Vegan diet-minded girlfriend, he undergoes his bizarre experiment.At first, he's fine, nothing out of the ordinary until cholesterol starts shooting up, his breathing becomes more labored and there's a decrease in sexual energy (hilariously put by his girlfriend). I don't want to spoil the rest of the experiment but obviously, no one's supposed to eat that much McDonalds but still it is fascinating and informative on just what exactly a fast food diet does to someone. Whether you're going to cut the restaurant's food completely out of your daily food intake or just simply eat it now and then is up to you.Also, if you want a shorter but even more convincing argument about McDonalds food, check out the experiment where he takes the Big Mac, Chicken Grill, Filet O Fish, Quarter Pounder, McDonalds fries and burger and fries from a local place and puts them in jars and sees them decompose over time. Some flat out look disgusting and what happens to the fries from the Golden Arches is even surprising.Think they'll ever make a food attacking the Root Bear? Or Wendy's?

770033,A3AQDK1F0YQKAS,B0000B1OC4,"Conner Macleod ""Afficionado""","[21, 50]","I finally watched this film after so much hype and people hailing it as some sort of great masterpiece that highlights the inherent dangers of eating McDonald's. Fortunately I didn't have to pay to watch this film, it was on TV, and it was exactly as how I perceived it would be, a waste of time telling me some information that I already knew.I can see how this film would be quite informative for those of you who live outside the USA, but having lived here for well over a decade, I already knew pretty much everything the movie covered. The school food programs, the processed chicken that goes into McNuggets, the high fat content of most of Mickey D's menu, etc.Yes, McDonald's can be bad for you, this is common knowledge. To prove exactly how bad it is, a person would have to conduct a scientific study, one which involves a control group, and one that involves a test group. Let's say 10 people in each group. That would cover ethnic, biological and personal backgrounds for a wide variety of people, not to mention their diet and exercise patterns.The control group would exercise on a regular basis, besides just walking as the narrator did, and they would also eat McDonald's 3 times a day. The test group would eat McDonald's without exercise, then after a month was up, they could compare and contrast the various results of those who ate the same food yet exercised less than the others.  None of this was covered in the so-called ""documentary"", it was only the guy who made the film that was part of the ""experiment"".Sure, the marketing tactics aimed at children as well as adults was relatively informative, but I have seen several real documentaries that covered this aspect in a far more comprehensive and scientific manner, so that was nothing new nor shocking.From personal experience I know people back in high school who ate at McDonald's every day, several times a day, but exercised on a regular basis and never had any health problems, and remained slim and fit. There were also lots of people in high school who ate at McDonald's every day but did NOT exercise, and they were out of shape and overweight. That's a no-brainer, it's not health food but it's not as terrible as it is made out to be.Moderation is key to everything in life, that includes fast food, and coupled with exercise, it's not anywhere near as awful as this movie sensationalizes it to be. Another important point that this movie briefly mentioned but shied away from was personal responsibility. Throughout the film the creator pointed the finger at the big bad evil corporate America, well there's this thing called self-discipline that apparently many people lack, and ironically this film perpetuates a major problem in America, which is passing the buck, ""sue the bastards"".  If anything this movie perpetuates the disturbing mentality of supporting frivilous lawsuits, much like the lawsuit mentioned early on in the film in regards to the two teenage kids who sued McDonald's for their own weight problems.In no other country in the world do people sue as much as they do here in the states. If a person falls and slips on the ice outside a restaurant, people sue the restaurant here. Back in my home country, people would feel silly for not being careful enough, and the last thing on their mind would be to blame some external factor for their own faults. I find it rather funny that this film becomes a part of the problem rather than any solution while attempting to change the status quo in a positive manner. People need to look at themselves and their own kids before they go pointing the finger at evil conglomerates.Fortunately I didn't waste any money on this film and if anyone out there has thought about seeing it, please don't, save yourself the time and potentially money of watching a meritless exercise in trying to prove to the public what most people already know, or at the very least should know.There is another disturbing thing about this movie.  The film uses subliminal messages with evil portraits of McDonald's depicting children in clown costumes and make up that look like some rejects from a cheap horror film. This film is at best a minor wake-up call to the minority of Americans who are woefully ignorant of fast food's dangers or people who have never lived in the USA and are not familiar with its culture but at its worst it is not much more than cheap propaganda with clever editing serving you a very biased, calorie-ridden and fat-laden mouthful of the ""truth"".",1,'Super Size Me' Leaves One With a Bad Taste,1134691200,"12 16, 2005",2005,4506,"['finally', 'watched', 'film', 'so', 'much', 'hype', 'people', 'hailing', 'sort', 'great', 'masterpiece', 'inherent', 'dangers', 'eating', 'McDonald', 'Fortunately', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'pay', 'watch', 'film', 'was', 'TV', 'was', 'exactly', 'how', 'perceived', 'would', 'be', 'waste', 'time', 'telling', 'information', 'already', 'knew.I', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'quite', 'informative', 'who', 'live', 'USA', 'having', 'lived', 'here', 'well', 'decade', 'already', 'knew', 'pretty', 'much', 'everything', 'movie', 'covered', 'school', 'food', 'programs', 'processed', 'chicken', 'McNuggets', 'high', 'fat', 'content', 'most', 'Mickey', 'D', 'menu', 'etc.Yes', 'McDonald', 'can', 'be', 'bad', 'common', 'knowledge', 'prove', 'exactly', 'how', 'bad', 'person', 'would', 'have', 'conduct', 'scientific', 'study', 'one', 'control', 'group', 'one', 'test', 'group', 'Let', 'say', '10', 'people', 'group', 'would', 'cover', 'ethnic', 'biological', 'personal', 'backgrounds', 'wide', 'variety', 'people', 'not', 'mention', 'diet', 'exercise', 'patterns.The', 'control', 'group', 'would', 'exercise', 'regular', 'basis', 'just', 'walking', 'narrator', 'did', 'would', 'also', 'eat', 'McDonald', '3', 'times', 'day', 'test', 'group', 'would', 'eat', 'McDonald', 'exercise', 'then', 'month', 'was', 'up', 'could', 'compare', 'contrast', 'various', 'results', 'who', 'ate', 'same', 'food', 'yet', 'exercised', 'less', 'others', 'None', 'was', 'covered', 'so-called', 'documentary', 'was', 'only', 'guy', 'who', 'made', 'film', 'was', 'part', 'experiment', '.Sure', 'marketing', 'tactics', 'aimed', 'children', 'as', 'well', 'adults', 'was', 'relatively', 'informative', 'have', 'seen', 'several', 'real', 'documentaries', 'covered', 'aspect', 'far', 'more', 'comprehensive', 'scientific', 'manner', 'was', 'nothing', 'new', 'shocking.From', 'personal', 'experience', 'know', 'people', 'back', 'high', 'school', 'who', 'ate', 'McDonald', 'day', 'several', 'times', 'day', 'exercised', 'regular', 'basis', 'never', 'had', 'health', 'problems', 'remained', 'slim', 'fit', 'were', 'also', 'lots', 'people', 'high', 'school', 'who', 'ate', 'McDonald', 'day', 'did', 'NOT', 'exercise', 'were', 'shape', 'overweight', 'no-brainer', 'not', 'health', 'food', 'not', 'as', 'terrible', 'made', 'out', 'be.Moderation', 'key', 'everything', 'life', 'fast', 'food', 'coupled', 'exercise', 'not', 'anywhere', 'as', 'awful', 'movie', 'be', 'important', 'point', 'movie', 'briefly', 'mentioned', 'shied', 'away', 'was', 'personal', 'responsibility', 'film', 'creator', 'pointed', 'finger', 'big', 'bad', 'evil', 'corporate', 'America', 'well', 'thing', 'called', 'self-discipline', 'apparently', 'many', 'people', 'lack', 'ironically', 'film', 'major', 'problem', 'America', 'passing', 'buck', 'sue', 'bastards', 'anything', 'movie', 'disturbing', 'mentality', 'supporting', 'frivilous', 'lawsuits', 'much', 'lawsuit', 'mentioned', 'early', 'film', 'regards', 'two', 'teenage', 'kids', 'who', 'sued', 'McDonald', 'own', 'weight', 'problems.In', 'other', 'country', 'world', 'do', 'people', 'sue', 'as', 'much', 'do', 'here', 'states', 'person', 'slips', 'ice', 'restaurant', 'people', 'sue', 'restaurant', 'here', 'Back', 'home', 'country', 'people', 'would', 'feel', 'silly', 'not', 'being', 'careful', 'enough', 'last', 'thing', 'mind', 'would', 'be', 'blame', 'external', 'factor', 'own', 'faults', 'find', 'rather', 'funny', 'film', 'part', 'problem', 'rather', 'solution', 'attempting', 'change', 'status', 'quo', 'positive', 'manner', 'People', 'need', 'look', 'own', 'kids', 'go', 'pointing', 'finger', 'evil', 'conglomerates.Fortunately', 'did', ""n't"", 'waste', 'money', 'film', 'anyone', 'there', 'thought', 'seeing', 'please', 'do', ""n't"", 'save', 'time', 'potentially', 'money', 'watching', 'meritless', 'exercise', 'trying', 'prove', 'public', 'what', 'most', 'people', 'already', 'know', 'very', 'least', 'should', 'know.There', 'disturbing', 'thing', 'movie', 'film', 'subliminal', 'messages', 'evil', 'portraits', 'McDonald', 'depicting', 'children', 'clown', 'costumes', 'make', 'up', 'look', 'rejects', 'cheap', 'horror', 'film', 'film', 'best', 'minor', 'wake-up', 'call', 'minority', 'Americans', 'who', 'are', 'woefully', 'ignorant', 'fast', 'food', 'dangers', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'never', 'lived', 'USA', 'are', 'not', 'familiar', 'culture', 'worst', 'not', 'much', 'more', 'cheap', 'propaganda', 'clever', 'editing', 'serving', 'very', 'biased', 'calorie-ridden', 'fat-laden', 'mouthful', 'truth']",N/A

I recently caught his documentary Super Size Me at a budget theater & hope the DVD will have many features. For those who don't know SSM is the best political documentary this year- far better than MM's lamentable Fahrenheit 9/11.Both films have baddies- W. Bush & McDonald's, both have their filmmakers as stars- MM & MS, but MS has a few things going for him that MM doesn't- 1) a penchant for being honest, 2) a message that affects all his viewers, & 3) a sense of self-deprecation. He demonstrates this by deciding to guinea pig his health in testing whether or not McDonald's fast food is really bad for you. He vows to eat nothing but McDonald's for 1 month straight.He starts off with a routine physical exam- which shows him to be in above average physical shape for a man I'd reckon is in his early 30s. His month-long odyssey will take him across the country, & to the brink of serious health issues. This is all documented by a cardiologist, gastroenterologist, internist, nutritionist/dietician, & physical trainer- not to mention his vegan chef girlfriend, Alexandra Jamieson, whose almost self-parodically the typical bored white girl with no better cause to be for.... All in all Super Size Me is a terrific film that entertains & enlightens. Can someone eat healthily at a McDonald's? Not really- but the point has gotten to the point that that's not really the point. The point is this can kill you as slowly & surely as cigarets, alcohol, & drug abuse. Here's hoping that MS becomes as big a name as MM, so that he will be able to tackle a varied subject palette.

Pencil,"[6, 9]","First of all, this is a VERY entertaining film and a very important one.For all those who keep saying, ""the message is obvious without seeing the film.."", and ""what a dumb thing this guy did by eating nothing but McDonalds.."", I feel that these folks are missing the point.  This movie is not only about McDonald's food and Morgan's diet. What this film did was show the serious effect that certain processed foods have on our bodies and environment in general.There are many, many of us eating these types of processed foods on a daily basis ( not just limited to McDonald's ) and more often than not, it's creating a fertile ground for sickness of all kinds.  This film can help to open our eyes to the fact that diet plays more of a crucial role in our immediate health than what is even normally thought.  For anyone who is struggling with making healthy whole food choices, see this film.  It will set you on the path to doing something about it with conviction.The most compelling and touching segment of this film is the section on children and their diets at school.  It's worth seeing if just for this segment alone.This film is not just about fast food alone, but about food choices and food industries in this country in general.  For further revealing knowledge on the effect our food choices are having on our health and the whole world, read any of the books by John Robbins, ( i.e. ""The Food Revolution"", ""Diet for a New America"", & ""May All Be Fed"" ).  John is one of the guests who is interviewed in ""Supersize Me"" and has a very interesting personal history as well as eye opening information on the global impact our food choices are having.Highly Recommended.",5,Excellent!,1096502400,"09 30, 2004",2004,1679,"['First', 'all', 'VERY', 'entertaining', 'film', 'very', 'important', 'who', 'keep', 'saying', 'message', 'obvious', 'seeing', 'film..', 'what', 'dumb', 'thing', 'guy', 'did', 'eating', 'nothing', 'McDonalds..', 'feel', 'folks', 'are', 'missing', 'point', 'movie', 'not', 'only', 'McDonald', 'food', 'Morgan', 'diet', 'What', 'film', 'did', 'was', 'show', 'serious', 'effect', 'certain', 'processed', 'foods', 'have', 'bodies', 'environment', 'general.There', 'are', 'many', 'many', 'eating', 'types', 'processed', 'foods', 'daily', 'basis', 'not', 'just', 'limited', 'McDonald', 'more', 'often', 'not', 'creating', 'fertile', 'ground', 'sickness', 'kinds', 'film', 'can', 'help', 'open', 'eyes', 'fact', 'diet', 'more', 'crucial', 'role', 'immediate', 'health', 'what', 'even', 'normally', 'thought', 'anyone', 'who', 'struggling', 'making', 'healthy', 'whole', 'food', 'choices', 'see', 'film', 'will', 'set', 'path', 'doing', 'something', 'conviction.The', 'most', 'compelling', 'touching', 'segment', 'film', 'section', 'children', 'diets', 'school', 'worth', 'seeing', 'just', 'segment', 'alone.This', 'film', 'not', 'just', 'fast', 'food', 'alone', 'food', 'choices', 'food', 'industries', 'country', 'general', 'further', 'revealing', 'knowledge', 'effect', 'food', 'choices', 'are', 'having', 'health', 'whole', 'world', 'read', 'books', 'John', 'Robbins', 'i.e', 'Food', 'Revolution', 'Diet', 'New', 'America', 'May', 'All', 'Be', 'Fed', 'John', 'one', 'guests', 'who', 'interviewed', 'Supersize', 'Me', 'very', 'interesting', 'personal', 'history', 'as', 'well', 'eye', 'opening', 'information', 'global', 'impact', 'food', 'choices', 'are', 'having.Highly', 'Recommended']",N/A

Filmmaker Morgan Spurlock does just the opposite.  He throws it in the faces of the movie-going public with a unique and intelligent fervor, akin to that of Eric Schlosser, author of Fast Food Nation.  Spurlock states ""Super Size Me is one man's journey into the world of weight gain, health problems and fast food. It's an examination of the American way of life and the influence that has had on our children, the nation and the world at large.""  Furthermore, ""It's a film about corporate responsibility and personal responsibility,"" and indeed this film is just that.Spurlock spends 30 grueling days eating nothing but McDonalds food, and exploits the health risks accompanying such a lifestyle in the process.  Under the supervision of three medical doctors and a nutritionist, Spurlock's health steadily declines, his weight steadily increases, and his cholesterol skyrockets.  All the while, his vegan chef girlfriend, Alex Jamieson, is in the background rolling her eyes.Interspersed throughout the documentation of Spurlock's McDiet are highly intriguing facts regarding the food industry and its somewhat less-than-benign ventures, as well as interviews with key people who have attempted to urge the public to change their eating habits for the better (such as author John Robbins and former Surgeon General David Satcher).  Though this film is chock full of facts and statistics, Spurlock is not without witty repartee and humor.  In other words, this is not your average snore-inducing PBS special.I must agree with the criticism this film has received for not being as scientific as it could have been, as his personal results may not be representative of what others would experience (the Big Mac fanatic Eric Gorske is a prime example of this).  Nonetheless, his results are still rather eye-opening and almost vomit-inducing.  The public should be aware of the things they are placing in their mouths everyday, and the effects those things could potentially have on them.This is definitely a movie worth buying and watching over and over again, particularly when you get the urge to go grab a meal from a local fast food joint.  This film caused McDonalds to put an end to Super-sizing before it even entered theaters, and that in itself should say something.

770039,A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH,B0000B1OC4,"Damian Gunn ""The Dark One is I""","[2, 3]","Morgan Spurlock, a documentary film maker, took his life in his hands when he decided to study what would happen to his body if he only ate McDonalds for a month.  More than just gain weight, the fast food empire took a toll on his physical health, his sexual lebido, his energy, helped him form an addiction and, according to his doctors, did a number on his organs.  I've heard some people say that this film is irrelevant because they don't eat fast food all day long but whether you do or not, what your putting in your body from just eating a little is terrible for you.  What I find humorous is the fact that since this film was released McDonalds has put salads and the like on their menus, but recent studies have shown there's more fat and calaries in their salad dressing than in a cheeseburger.  So I guess it really wasn't an improvment.  I think the biggest eye opener of the film is the way McDonalds targets the children, which we all knew, I mean we were all kids once and we loved our McDonalds, but getting in the schools and the like is a shame.  Our kids have no escape from childhood obesity, and the earlier that happens the harder it will be for our children to get over it.  The film also shows how despite the fact we all would rather eat healthy, the fact remains that fast food is more accessible than healthy food, it's cheaper and quicker and on every corner.  The food that's good for you cost over twice the amount of the food that's not, and with a McDonalds on almost EVERY corner it's much easier to walk into one of those then say a Subway, spend $5 at McDonalds and get two burgers, a fry and a drink as apposed to $10 at Subway, and that's just a sub and a small drink.  So you see the problem lies in our society, a society that almost forces average citizens to eat what they shouldn't.  It's sad.

770040,AQ990HW13DP08,B0000B1OC4,Daniel B. Clendenin,"[7, 7]","Before I saw this film I had dismissed it as a piece of lightweight pop cinema. In a sense it is, but in another sense it is a serious documentary about a national epidemic whose name is obesity. Here in California, a recent newspaper article reported that only one quarter of 1.3 million school children tested could pass minimal physical fitness requirements. At the current rate, obesity will pass smoking as the leading cause of preventable death. Perhaps it is unfair that Super Size Me picks on McDonalds, but it is, nevertheless, far and away the largest purveyor and most powerful icon of junk food morbidity. What would happen, wondered Morgan Spurlock, if he ate three meals a day for 30 days at McDonalds? This film shows you. He followed three rules: everything he ate had to be on the Mickey D menu; he had to sample every offering at least once; and he would only order ""super size"" when prompted by the cashier. Spurlock consumed about 5,000 calories a day of sugar, fat and salt, added 25 pounds, jacked his blood pressure and cholesterol numbers into the stratosphere, experienced head aches and chest pains, and came pretty close to killing himself.

In the process, he gains 24 pounds and nearly turns his liver into Jello.Of course the ""experiment"" is rigged to end in disaster.  Spurlock tries to eat at least 2 or 3 meals a day a McDonalds, he tries to eat everything he is served, he has to ""super-size"" his meal if the McDonald's clerk asks him if he wants to, and he has to limit his daily physical exercise to the average amount a U.S. adult gets.  Of course this is going to result in a health catastrophe.  (Still, it is very interesting that his diet plays the sort of havoc with his liver that the doctor would have expected if he had done what Nicholas Cage did in ""Leaving Las Vegas"", i.e., try to drink himself to death.)  And it is true that a Big Mac has only 560 calories, and the average man could eat 3 or 4 a day without gaining weight, if that is all he ate.  (And spurlock shows a man who eats that many, and is not fat--although maybe this was in the extra features portion of the DVD.)But this is still an excellent and very intertaining film--far better than Michael Moore's ""Fehrenheit 911.""  You have to have a certain amount of respect for Spurlock, or for anyone who is willing to sacrifice themselves for their art, even if you would not imitate that person.  Spurlock is making a point--this food is not good for you--and he is entitled to make his argument in an exaggerated way.Do not miss the special feature ""the smoking fry.""

Indeed, in a short time, he began to suffer serious problems with his liver. His physicians were surprised and alarmed. He also put on weight and although he did not become morbidly obese in this short period of time, he did become decidedly paunchy and flabby.There are questions that I have which are unexplored. Is it the carbs in the roles and sauces and the sugar in the soda and milkshakes that did the damage? Or, perhaps, is it the fatty content of the food? Perhaps it is a combination of the two. Being on a low carb diet, my personal suspicion is that the rolls, fries, sugar, etc. are the main culprits. Then again, I may be wrong.

In fact, Spurlock, forsaking his vegan girlfriend's healthy cuisine, gained about 25 pounds and saw his cholesterol level shoot up to dangerous levels as he huffed and puffed his way three times a day through myriad Big Macs and fillet o' fish sandwiches, milk shakes, sodas, fries and other not-so-delicate items from the menu of the world's largest purveyor of fast food.  He had hired three doctors and a registered dietician to check his vital signs and give him a thorough physical exam prior to this experiment in not-so-fine dining.

After all, Spurlock eschewed exercise during the experiment, and of course nobody (?) actually eats every meal at McDonald's as Spurlock did.  Furthermore he actually doubled his normal caloric intake from about 2500 calories a day to about 5000.  Regardless I think we can say that his experience was indicative.The real question to be asked here (and Spurlock asks it) is whether McDonald's (or as some have dubbed thee) whether McDeath's can be or should be held responsible for the epidemic of obesity that is sweeping the country.  Spurlock implies that McDonald's should be held responsible at least for its advertising aimed at children.  I agree with this.  But I also think that adults ought to know what they are doing.  If they choose to chow down at a place that loves to super size and under nourish them, perhaps they themselves should be held responsible for the consequences.  However, some people feel that the advertising has been so insidious for so long and the food so addictive to susceptible individuals that McDonald's ought to be taken to court just as the tobacco companies have been.For more information on the epidemic, its consequences, and what can be done about it, I refer the interested reader to The Hungry Gene: The Science of Fat and the Future of Thin by Ellen Ruppel Shell; Fat Land: How Americans Became the Fastest People in the World by Eric Critser; and Fast Food Nation: The Dark Side of the All-American Meal by Eric Schlosser.  Schlosser appears in one of the bonus features being interviewed by Spurlock.  This interview is one of the highlights of the DVD.  Schlosser is articulate, candid, and very well-informed.Spurlock of course is a  performer as well as a film maker.  His directorial style owes something to that of Michael Moore, and his playful on-camera muggings remind me of Ian Wright of PBS's Globe Trekker series.See this as an introduction to this most serious threat to the nation's health, especially as it affects children.  Morgan Spurlock is to be commended for bringing the reality of the epidemic to the attention of the general public.By the way, ""McTingles"" are those highflying, scary feelings you get after rapidly injecting massive amounts of pure sugar and caffeine into your system, usually by gulping your way through a 64-ounce McCola--and to think when I was a kid, Coca-Cola came in six-ounce bottles.

Unfortunately; the hectic schedule faced by most working Americans these days has elevated the viability of the fast food diet. So it's not surprising that Mr. Spurlock got sick following McDonalds dietary lead. What was alarming though was the rate at which Mr. Spurlock's body started to deteriorate; his doctor was visibly shaken and that's scary. And although this may not be a scientific analysis, there seems to be a direct correlation between busy lives, sleep deprivation, fast food and obesity.

All that time and reviews later, it remains a shame that too many people missed some important points that Spurlock made, whether intentional or not.  Such as ...- how incompetent American medicine is.  None of the three doctors he had ""intensely"" supervising him during the month-long experiment had a clue as to what was causing his headaches, chest pains, and throbbing in his private area.  The only sort of answer was revealed in his lab tests - as his liver was turning to fat and his cholesterol, blood pressure (a little high to begin with), and triglycerides kept going up and up and up.But, on the other hand, I don't think American medicine realizes (or, perhaps, wants to realize) the depth of the danger that eating fast food slop regularly poses to the human body.  None of those doctors saw what was coming in terms of how much fat and sugar is put into this stuff.  The doctors were even afraid to say, near the end of the documentary, just how dangerous fast food is, even with lab results in front of their faces - and it's all because of the money and power of these fast food corporations who don't like the truth being said because it affects their bottom line.- why, since there's such concern ""for the children"" of this country, do politicians quiver and steadfastly refuse to enact legislation to keep McDonald's and other fast food companies from marketing their ""food"" to little children?  It's a fact (proven before Spurlock did this documentary) that if kids are started on the wrong foot nutritionally they are being set up for a lifetime of failure - dangerous weight flunctuations, fad diets, ad nauseum.  Of all things to be concerned about, a child's health should trump everything else.- why Americans, long aware of the danger of this slop, continue to pay McDonald's and other fast food joints to poison themselves.It's a given that McDonald's corporate toads will post negative reviews here to smear Spurlock's work (just as they did with Eric Schlosser and ""Fast Food Nation""), but what can one expect?  Spurlock's blood test results spoke volumes as to the nutritional ""value"" of McDonald's ""food.""And, by the way, Don Gorske is a rare exception that eating fast food poses no harm.  I highly doubt the majority of McDonald's patrons can eat half a dozen Big Macs a day - and nothing else - and be fit as a fiddle.The truth always hurts, but I agree with Schlosser in his interview with Spurlock on the DVD extras: The consumer is the one with the power (not his exact words).  Everyone has the power to just not patronize these fast food joints.  If enough of people make their health a priority and realize the dangers of consuming this stuff regularly, joints like McDonald's would disappear overnight.Spurlock did a decent job here and it's always nice to see people made uncomfortable by the facts.

770060,A633NIAR4JJAR,B0000B1OC4,"Dr. Marc Axelrod ""PM""","[5, 13]","Morgan Spurlock eats nothing but McDonalds food three times a day for 30 days. His goal is to eat everything on the menu during that time and to super size his meal only when asked by the cashier if this is what he wants. He also drank regular cola instead of diet soda.During these 30 days, he gains 24 pounds, and his liver and enzyme levels go through the roof. He is now 2x more likely to have a heart attack, and he is short of breath and tired and depressed much of the time. He feels that this experiment proves how addictive and dangerous fast food can be.In response, I would say that eating McDonald's wasn't Spurlock's problem. Eating an insane amount of calories and carbohydrates was his problem. Others have eaten McDonalds on a daily basis as part of a USA recommended 2000 calorie diet, and have maintained a consistently healthy lifestyle.This movie is an interesting study of what can happen to a person when he follows a stupid diet. But it is an unsuccessful attempt at proving that fast food is by nature worse or more addicting than other foods.I contend that if you eat smart and exercise a little self-control, you can eat at McDonald's 3 times a day and lose as much weight as you like. For example, as part of a USDA recommended 2000 calorie diet, a guy could have an Egg McMuffin with cheese and ham (300 calories) and black coffee for breakfast, a Big Mac, a small fries, a side salad, and a diet soda for lunch (910 calories), and a McChicken with a diet soda and a southwest salad without the chicken(510 calories), and that still leaves you with 280 calories to spread throughout the day for snacks. Or you could use them all up with two scoops of ice cream. If you walk a half hour a day, you WILL lose weight! (Women may need to limit themselves to less calories).For variety's sake, you could have scrambled eggs and a hashbrown and black coffee for breakfast (310 calories), a quarter pounder with cheese, a small side salad and small fries and a diet coke for lunch (860 calories), and a ten piece Chicken McNuggets, a caesar salad without chicken, and a fruit and yogurt parfait without granola and a diet soda (670 calories), and still have 140 calories for some pretzels or 2 cookies.If you want to drink the highly caloric shakes, then drink half of what they give you. If you get the 1200 calorie Big breakfast, use the same approach: eat no more than half of what they give you. There's no law that says you have to eat everything in sight.The movie gets 4 stars for being an interesting documentary, but I can't give it 5 stars because its methodology is flawed.",4,An Interesting and Unsuccessful Attack on Fast Food.,1177804800,"04 29, 2007",2007,2605,"['Morgan', 'Spurlock', 'nothing', 'McDonalds', 'food', 'three', 'times', 'day', '30', 'days', 'goal', 'eat', 'everything', 'menu', 'time', 'super', 'size', 'meal', 'only', 'when', 'asked', 'cashier', 'what', 'also', 'drank', 'regular', 'cola', 'instead', 'diet', 'soda.During', '30', 'days', 'gains', '24', 'pounds', 'liver', 'enzyme', 'levels', 'go', 'roof', 'now', '2x', 'more', 'likely', 'have', 'heart', 'attack', 'short', 'breath', 'tired', 'depressed', 'much', 'time', 'experiment', 'how', 'addictive', 'dangerous', 'fast', 'food', 'can', 'be.In', 'response', 'would', 'say', 'eating', 'McDonald', 'was', ""n't"", 'Spurlock', 'problem', 'Eating', 'insane', 'amount', 'calories', 'carbohydrates', 'was', 'problem', 'Others', 'have', 'eaten', 'McDonalds', 'daily', 'basis', 'part', 'USA', 'recommended', '2000', 'calorie', 'diet', 'have', 'maintained', 'consistently', 'healthy', 'lifestyle.This', 'movie', 'interesting', 'study', 'what', 'can', 'happen', 'person', 'when', 'stupid', 'diet', 'unsuccessful', 'attempt', 'proving', 'fast', 'food', 'nature', 'worse', 'more', 'addicting', 'other', 'foods.I', 'contend', 'eat', 'smart', 'exercise', 'little', 'self-control', 'can', 'eat', 'McDonald', '3', 'times', 'day', 'lose', 'much', 'weight', 'like', 'example', 'part', 'USDA', 'recommended', '2000', 'calorie', 'diet', 'guy', 'could', 'have', 'Egg', 'McMuffin', 'cheese', 'ham', '300', 'calories', 'black', 'coffee', 'breakfast', 'Big', 'Mac', 'small', 'fries', 'side', 'salad', 'diet', 'soda', 'lunch', '910', 'calories', 'McChicken', 'diet', 'soda', 'southwest', 'salad', 'chicken', '510', 'calories', 'still', '280', 'calories', 'spread', 'day', 'snacks', 'could', 'use', 'up', 'two', 'scoops', 'ice', 'cream', 'walk', 'half', 'hour', 'day', 'WILL', 'lose', 'weight', 'Women', 'may', 'need', 'limit', 'less', 'calories', '.For', 'variety', 'sake', 'could', 'have', 'scrambled', 'eggs', 'hashbrown', 'black', 'coffee', 'breakfast', '310', 'calories', 'quarter', 'pounder', 'cheese', 'small', 'side', 'salad', 'small', 'fries', 'diet', 'coke', 'lunch', '860', 'calories', 'ten', 'piece', 'Chicken', 'McNuggets', 'caesar', 'salad', 'chicken', 'fruit', 'yogurt', 'parfait', 'granola', 'diet', 'soda', '670', 'calories', 'still', 'have', '140', 'calories', 'pretzels', '2', 'cookies.If', 'want', 'drink', 'highly', 'caloric', 'shakes', 'then', 'half', 'what', 'give', 'get', '1200', 'calorie', 'Big', 'breakfast', 'use', 'same', 'approach', 'eat', 'more', 'half', 'what', 'give', 'law', 'have', 'eat', 'everything', 'sight.The', 'movie', '4', 'stars', 'being', 'interesting', 'documentary', 'ca', ""n't"", 'give', '5', 'stars', 'methodology', 'flawed']",N/A

While there are valid points made, Spurlock's message would have been better served as a nationally aired commercial: ""McDonald's food isn't good for you. Don't eat there."" Instead, this 'mockumentary' comes off as nothing more than Spurlock's own one-man-slam against the world's largest fast food chain.Another reviewer said it best...this film is a clever blend of guerilla tatics and sensationalism. And that's all it is. Anyone who is stupid enough to eat fast food all the time, whether it's McDonald's or somewhere else, as reviewer Rocky IV said, then you deserve to die of clogged arteries and any other problems relating to obesity. Good-bye and good riddance.America has a problem with obesity because many Americans have become sedentary and complacent. A blunt way of putting it: Stupid and lazy. We set our kids in front of a computer or TV and that's the babysitter for the evening. We hire someone else to do our lawn care for us. Our idea of work has transformed into sitting at a desk and staring at a monitor. That's McDonald's fault??

Morgan Spurlock first discusses the obesity epidemic and then mentions how two girls were suing McDonald's, claiming their food caused them serious health problems.The judge told these girls they'd have a case if they could prove their health problems were strictly a result of eating McDonald's food.Intrigued by this case, Spurlock conducts a 30 day experiment, using his own body as a test subject, to find out exactly what kind of effect a strict fast food diet can have on the body.For 30 days, he will strictly eat only McDonald's food and cannot eat anything that is not available from their menu.  When placing an order, if the cashier asks him if he'd like to ""supersize"" his meal, he must say he will.He will also live his life like a typical American and restrict his exercise.Day 1 begins with him getting tested for overall health and fitness.  On day 30, he'll get checked again to see how much the diet affected these results.In the meantime, we as the viewer watch as he first is disgusted by his new dietary choices -- just to warn you, there's a vomit scene -- and then becomes an addict.It's pretty fascinating to watch the transformation...well, except for his vegan girlfriend who is pained watching someone she loves destroy his body.At the end, the effect on his health and fitness level shouldn't be too surprising, but it's still a good wake-up call.Sometimes I think getting a visual of the harmful effects can be more effective than simply listening to warnings.Besides checking his status for 30 days, other questions are posed like...is the obesity epidemic a personal problem, a corporate problem, or both?Should junk food be allowed in schools?  Would only serving health food in schools make much of a difference?Also shown is how much advertising is a presence in our lives.  For example, Spurlock has a group of children individually identify faces on flash cards.  Some knew who George Washington was, no one knew who Jesus was, but all of them knew who Ronald McDonald was.He also tested a group of women to recite the Pledge of Allegiance to see how much of the words they knew.  All of them flubbed their lines.  But when asked to recite the McDonald's theme song, all of them got it 100% correct.The DVD extras were also interesting.  I especially enjoyed the interview with the author of Fast Food Nation as well as Spurlock's experiment to see how McDonald's food degrades over time.Overall, I found this documentary entertaining both for the material covered and because I think Spurlock is an entertaining host.The reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 is because I thought it could've been better organized and focused.",4,30 days of deterioration,1258502400,"11 18, 2009",2009,2733,"['documentary', 'same', 'format', 't.v', 'show', '30', 'days', 'Morgan', 'Spurlock', 'first', 'obesity', 'epidemic', 'then', 'mentions', 'how', 'two', 'girls', 'were', 'suing', 'McDonald', 'claiming', 'food', 'caused', 'serious', 'health', 'problems.The', 'judge', 'told', 'girls', ""'d"", 'have', 'case', 'could', 'prove', 'health', 'problems', 'were', 'strictly', 'result', 'eating', 'McDonald', 'food.Intrigued', 'case', 'Spurlock', '30', 'day', 'experiment', 'using', 'own', 'body', 'test', 'subject', 'find', 'out', 'exactly', 'what', 'kind', 'effect', 'strict', 'fast', 'food', 'diet', 'can', 'have', 'body.For', '30', 'days', 'will', 'strictly', 'eat', 'only', 'McDonald', 'food', 'can', 'not', 'eat', 'anything', 'not', 'available', 'menu', 'When', 'placing', 'order', 'cashier', ""'d"", 'like', 'supersize', 'meal', 'must', 'say', 'will.He', 'will', 'also', 'live', 'life', 'typical', 'American', 'restrict', 'exercise.Day', '1', 'begins', 'getting', 'tested', 'overall', 'health', 'fitness', 'day', '30', ""'ll"", 'get', 'checked', 'again', 'see', 'how', 'much', 'diet', 'affected', 'results.In', 'meantime', 'viewer', 'watch', 'first', 'disgusted', 'new', 'dietary', 'choices', 'just', 'warn', 'vomit', 'scene', 'then', 'addict.It', 'pretty', 'fascinating', 'watch', 'transformation', 'well', 'vegan', 'girlfriend', 'who', 'pained', 'watching', 'someone', 'destroy', 'body.At', 'end', 'effect', 'health', 'fitness', 'level', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'too', 'surprising', 'still', 'good', 'wake-up', 'call.Sometimes', 'think', 'getting', 'visual', 'harmful', 'effects', 'can', 'be', 'more', 'effective', 'simply', 'listening', 'warnings.Besides', 'checking', 'status', '30', 'days', 'other', 'questions', 'are', 'posed', 'obesity', 'personal', 'problem', 'corporate', 'problem', 'Should', 'junk', 'food', 'be', 'allowed', 'schools', 'Would', 'only', 'serving', 'health', 'food', 'schools', 'make', 'much', 'difference', 'Also', 'shown', 'how', 'much', 'advertising', 'presence', 'lives', 'example', 'Spurlock', 'group', 'children', 'individually', 'identify', 'flash', 'cards', 'knew', 'who', 'George', 'Washington', 'was', 'one', 'knew', 'who', 'Jesus', 'was', 'knew', 'who', 'Ronald', 'McDonald', 'was.He', 'also', 'tested', 'group', 'women', 'recite', 'Pledge', 'Allegiance', 'see', 'how', 'much', 'words', 'knew', 'flubbed', 'lines', 'when', 'asked', 'recite', 'McDonald', 'theme', 'song', 'got', '100', '%', 'correct.The', 'DVD', 'extras', 'were', 'also', 'interesting', 'especially', 'enjoyed', 'interview', 'author', 'Fast', 'Food', 'Nation', 'as', 'well', 'Spurlock', 'experiment', 'see', 'how', 'McDonald', 'food', 'degrades', 'time.Overall', 'found', 'documentary', 'entertaining', 'material', 'covered', 'think', 'Spurlock', 'entertaining', 'host.The', 'reason', 'gave', '4', 'stars', 'instead', '5', 'thought', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'better', 'organized', 'focused']",N/A

770067,A3S1YIQQW7AZO,B0000B1OC4,EMAN NEP,"[15, 18]","Like many of the people that gave this movie 1 or 2 stars, I have to agree that it was ridiculous for this guy to eat 3 meals a day for 30 consecutive days, exclusively at McDonalds. I will agree with them that if you eat at just about anywhere except mom's home cooking, you will probably get bad results. And finally, I will agree that it is we ourselves that sometimes make the decision to eat fast/bad food.But for those that say, ""Oh, well, he ate McDonald's for 30 days straight and DIDN'T EXCERCISE"", your point is pointless, because, fact of the matter is: How many Americans ACTUALLY excercise? And sorry, ladies and gents, jogging your dog for 2 blocks does not count. In the US Army, to be considered ""fit"" you have to be able to run 2 miles (with a time limit no less), do ""X"" amount of pushups (more than 20, properly), and do ""X"" amount of sit-ups (more than 40, properly). Sound extreme? I thought it did, before I joined the Army. Then I realized my full potential and after two years I could run EIGHT miles non-stop.And even now, could an American soldier compare with the pioneers of the old west, men who WALKED across America. Or the Medieval soldiers who ran/marched to a distant valley and fought a grueling battle at the end of it?In the movie there is a part where this French lady says how the servings in France are so much smaller and the fast food restaurants are so much nicer. I can attest to this from being stationed in Germany. My fellow soldiers (and myself) went to the Kentucky Fried Chicken in Regensburg, Germany, and we were floored by how CLEAN and RESTAURANT-LIKE the place was. And the servings, like the French lady said, are small. In Germany the typical size for a restaurant-bought Coca Cola is .2 Liters and you'll pay about 2 euro for that, compared to .5 liters of beer for the same price.Sure, we have free-will, the ability to think for ourselves, but all this advertising and media DOES affect our choices on a day to day basis.Let's look at some of the choices the average American has when it comes to eating. I'll use myself as an example. At work, my lunch is only 30 minutes long. Certainly not enough time to warrant going back to the house and also not enough time to eat at a nice restaurant. That leaves me with 3 choices: Bring my own sack-lunch from home, eat at McDonalds (or whatever fast-food place nearby), or just skip that meal.From this movie we see what eating excessively at McDonald's can do. Now how about bringing that sack-lunch to work? For one, it takes MONEY and TIME to eat well. How many Americans can honestly say they have BOTH. And from being in Europe, I can tell you that Americans pay way too much for food. In Europe I pay about 1 dollar for a slice of fresh Camembert Cheese. In the US? $5!!!! And are the foods in the grocery store any better than what you get with fast food? Cottenseed Oil, processed foods, imported foods, foods sprayed with pesticides, saturated fats, artificial food coloring (something you rarely, if ever, see in Europe).

The narrator interviewed lawyers, academics, doctors, media figures, and government officials about excessive fast food consumption and its effect on our nation.  The narrator also shows how fast food companies market to children to hook them on their products for life.The narrator underwent regular weigh-ins and blood work during the process, and the movie shows the drastic effects of this diet on the body after a month.  Spurlock lists twenty medical conditions commonly exacerbated by obesity.  A warning for parents of children who might watch the documentary:  there is one scene that shows stomach-size reduction surgery for a man who could simply not control his eating and drinking, and other scene that discusses the effects of excess weight on intimacy.  There is also scattered profanity in the film.Fast food is processed food, and I can add my own personal warning about one of the restaurant's sandwiches.  Early in 1992, I became hooked on the McRib, eating one every week before going to a gathering at my college that I used to attend on Tuesday nights.  After a couple of months, I abruptly decided to drop that habit--on the final Friday evening in April that year, I got severe food poisoning from a McRib and was sick all weekend.The bonus features on this DVD include scenes not used in the documentary and an interview with ""Fast Food Nation"" author Eric Schlosser.",5,The Danger of Excessive Fast Food,1272067200,"04 24, 2010",2010,1731,"['Super', 'Size', 'Me', 'famous', 'documentary', 'narrator', 'Morgan', 'Spurlock', 'personally', 'saw', 'how', 'unhealthy', 'steady', 'diet', 'fast', 'food', 'was', 'eating', 'nothing', 'McDonald', 'food', 'thirty', 'straight', 'days.Spurlock', 'statistics', 'exercise', 'obesity', 'including', 'estimate', 'one', 'third', 'Americans', 'born', '2000', 'may', 'develop', 'diabetes', 'narrator', 'interviewed', 'lawyers', 'academics', 'doctors', 'media', 'figures', 'government', 'officials', 'excessive', 'fast', 'food', 'consumption', 'effect', 'nation', 'narrator', 'also', 'how', 'fast', 'food', 'companies', 'market', 'children', 'hook', 'products', 'life.The', 'narrator', 'underwent', 'regular', 'weigh-ins', 'blood', 'work', 'process', 'movie', 'drastic', 'effects', 'diet', 'body', 'month', 'Spurlock', 'twenty', 'medical', 'conditions', 'commonly', 'exacerbated', 'obesity', 'warning', 'parents', 'children', 'who', 'might', 'watch', 'documentary', 'one', 'scene', 'stomach-size', 'reduction', 'surgery', 'man', 'who', 'could', 'simply', 'not', 'control', 'eating', 'drinking', 'other', 'scene', 'effects', 'excess', 'weight', 'intimacy', 'also', 'scattered', 'profanity', 'film.Fast', 'food', 'processed', 'food', 'can', 'add', 'own', 'personal', 'warning', 'one', 'restaurant', 'sandwiches', 'Early', '1992', 'became', 'hooked', 'McRib', 'eating', 'one', 'week', 'going', 'gathering', 'college', 'used', 'attend', 'Tuesday', 'nights', 'couple', 'months', 'abruptly', 'decided', 'drop', 'habit', 'final', 'Friday', 'evening', 'April', 'year', 'got', 'severe', 'food', 'poisoning', 'McRib', 'was', 'sick', 'weekend.The', 'bonus', 'features', 'DVD', 'include', 'scenes', 'not', 'used', 'documentary', 'interview', 'Fast', 'Food', 'Nation', 'author', 'Eric', 'Schlosser']",N/A

770074,A3IKBHODOTYYHM,B0000B1OC4,"fra7299 ""fra7299""","[2, 2]","There should be a note to viewers before this film begins: do not try this. Morgan Spurlock takes on a rather interesting idea that you probably haven't thought of before: eating McDonald's food for thirty straight days. Some of his basic rules: 1) he has to eat all 3 meals in the day  2) he can only supersize it if they ask him if he wants it supersized  3) he has to eat all items on the McDonalds menu. Much to the chagrin of his girlfriend, Spurlock wants to know what kind of effects thirty straight days of fast food would have on an otherwise healthy person. He starts to eat, and, as expected, his pounds begin to skyrocket, as does his cholesterol level.This film is truly entertaining if you take into account how much we have become a fast food savvy nation. Thinking about not only the American appeal of the fast food industry, and specifically McDonalds, but also the globalization of fast food as well, this is a documentary that criticizes the way we as a society feed not only ourselves, but our kids. The main premise of Morgan Spurlock's documentary ""Supersize Me"" is to make people aware of the dangers of habitually eating fast food. While this was an interesting idea and I did agree with this idea of making others aware of the dangers, I felt that, at many times, Spurlock insinuates that McDonald's and other fast food restaurants are responsible for the health of Americans (which is a notion that I find to be quite erroneous). Spurlock seems to be ""overdoing"" it and overdramaticizing everything for a purpose, and he points this out later in the film.There are certain educational aspects to this documentary, but, as one viewer noted, the slant and biased approach of the film against fast food will definitely cause some to be offended or skeptical of its accuracy. For instance, Spurlock tries to get the CEO for McDonalds on the phone, and we have to watch every single attempt to reach this person, as if he is driving home the point that McDonalds is some giant that has no time for the mere average members of society. There are also times he seems to be melodramatic about his ""moods""-at one point, after eating another McDonald's meal, he says he feels ""depressed."" There is also this overly long segment in which he interviews junior high students about their  ""unhealthy"" lunches and seems to ""blame"" the school (after blaming the lunch lady) for having only six healthy items on the menu (two words: sack lunches). If he could have tied this argument in with the notion of parents needing to be more aware and responsible for their kid's eating habits, then it would have made for a better argument. However, he seems to link McDonalds and fast food as the main reason that kids are not getting healthy lunches.While much of the assault is directed towards McDonalds, the bigger impact at hand seems to be the trend of a growing obesity problem in America. The ""Toxic Environment"" that Spurlock refers to-in which people have easy access to fast food, items, transportation, and live a life of instant gratification-is certainly detrimental when we lose sight of the fact that it even exists. If nothing else, this film is trying to shock us into a realization of what we are to getting closer towards, if we aren't already there. The means to this awareness is a bit over the top, as not many people could ever imagine eating that much fast food in a thirty day period. However, there are many interesting facts in the documentary, and, although a bit harsh on fast food, the primary point of being responsible for one's health is truly the force of this film.",4,Would you like your order supersized?,1103587200,"12 21, 2004",2004,3604,"['should', 'be', 'note', 'viewers', 'film', 'do', 'not', 'try', 'Morgan', 'Spurlock', 'rather', 'interesting', 'idea', 'probably', 'have', ""n't"", 'thought', 'eating', 'McDonald', 'food', 'thirty', 'straight', 'days', 'basic', 'rules', '1', 'eat', '3', 'meals', 'day', '2', 'can', 'only', 'supersize', 'ask', 'supersized', '3', 'eat', 'items', 'McDonalds', 'menu', 'Much', 'chagrin', 'girlfriend', 'Spurlock', 'know', 'what', 'kind', 'effects', 'thirty', 'straight', 'days', 'fast', 'food', 'would', 'have', 'otherwise', 'healthy', 'person', 'eat', 'expected', 'pounds', 'begin', 'skyrocket', 'cholesterol', 'level.This', 'film', 'truly', 'entertaining', 'take', 'account', 'how', 'much', 'have', 'become', 'fast', 'food', 'savvy', 'nation', 'Thinking', 'not', 'only', 'American', 'appeal', 'fast', 'food', 'industry', 'specifically', 'McDonalds', 'also', 'globalization', 'fast', 'food', 'as', 'well', 'documentary', 'way', 'society', 'feed', 'not', 'only', 'kids', 'main', 'premise', 'Morgan', 'Spurlock', 'documentary', 'Supersize', 'Me', 'make', 'people', 'aware', 'dangers', 'habitually', 'eating', 'fast', 'food', 'was', 'interesting', 'idea', 'did', 'agree', 'idea', 'making', 'others', 'aware', 'dangers', 'felt', 'many', 'times', 'Spurlock', 'McDonald', 'other', 'fast', 'food', 'restaurants', 'are', 'responsible', 'health', 'Americans', 'notion', 'find', 'be', 'quite', 'erroneous', 'Spurlock', 'be', 'overdoing', 'overdramaticizing', 'everything', 'purpose', 'out', 'later', 'are', 'certain', 'educational', 'aspects', 'documentary', 'one', 'viewer', 'noted', 'slant', 'biased', 'approach', 'film', 'fast', 'food', 'will', 'definitely', 'cause', 'be', 'offended', 'skeptical', 'accuracy', 'instance', 'Spurlock', 'get', 'CEO', 'McDonalds', 'phone', 'have', 'watch', 'single', 'attempt', 'reach', 'person', 'driving', 'home', 'point', 'McDonalds', 'giant', 'time', 'mere', 'average', 'members', 'society', 'are', 'also', 'times', 'be', 'melodramatic', 'moods', '-at', 'one', 'point', 'eating', 'McDonald', 'meal', 'depressed', 'also', 'overly', 'long', 'segment', 'junior', 'high', 'students', 'unhealthy', 'lunches', 'blame', 'school', 'blaming', 'lunch', 'lady', 'having', 'only', 'six', 'healthy', 'items', 'menu', 'two', 'words', 'sack', 'lunches', 'could', 'have', 'tied', 'argument', 'notion', 'parents', 'needing', 'be', 'more', 'aware', 'responsible', 'kid', 'eating', 'habits', 'then', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'better', 'argument', 'However', 'link', 'McDonalds', 'fast', 'food', 'main', 'reason', 'kids', 'are', 'not', 'getting', 'healthy', 'lunches.While', 'much', 'assault', 'directed', 'towards', 'McDonalds', 'bigger', 'impact', 'hand', 'be', 'trend', 'growing', 'obesity', 'problem', 'America', 'Toxic', 'Environment', 'Spurlock', 'refers', 'to-in', 'people', 'have', 'easy', 'access', 'fast', 'food', 'items', 'transportation', 'live', 'life', 'instant', 'gratification-is', 'certainly', 'detrimental', 'when', 'lose', 'sight', 'fact', 'even', 'nothing', 'else', 'film', 'trying', 'shock', 'realization', 'what', 'are', 'getting', 'closer', 'towards', 'are', ""n't"", 'already', 'there', 'means', 'awareness', 'bit', 'top', 'not', 'many', 'people', 'could', 'ever', 'imagine', 'eating', 'much', 'fast', 'food', 'thirty', 'day', 'period', 'However', 'are', 'many', 'interesting', 'facts', 'documentary', 'bit', 'harsh', 'fast', 'food', 'primary', 'point', 'being', 'responsible', 'one', 'health', 'truly', 'force', 'film']",N/A

The result of the diet is however not very conclusively useful. What Spurlock failed to convey is whether the health condition after the diet is caused mostly by the burger buns and the meat, the fries or the drinks. A good research should be conducted under a realistic circumstance and result in a useful finding. The only health lesson of Spurlock's diet is this (and only this): ""Don't eat McD's continually the whole months"".Don Gorske, a person shown briefly in the documentary was said to have eaten 19,852 big macs (seldomly with fries) and his cholesterol level is 140 (a good level).

For most of us, eating it habitually will make us fat, sick and depressed.  In addition, McDonald's uses child-directed marketing to promote its mass-produced, low quality products.So why don't I give it five stars?  Here are the reasons:1.) The issue is a dead horse.  Everybody knows that eating nothing but McDonald's food 3 times a day will kill you.  Making a movie to prove it makes as much sense as producing a film to prove the world is round.2.) He stacks the deck by choosing the absolute worst foods on the menu.  Why not pick the bran muffins, salads, diet sodas and other healthier items on the menu?  Because it doesn't fit the film maker's agenda.3.) It's boring.  Watching this guy eat burgers gets old quick.4.) He even seems to defeat his own purpose at times.  For example, he interviews a John Lennon-looking guy (I think his name was Dan Gorsky) who has eaten at least two Big Macs a day for years.  But the guy is downright skinny!Also, the ""healthy"" person in the film, his girlfriend the vegan chef, has an ashen complexion and looks like a poster girl for anorexia research.  She also gives us TMI by telling us how saturated fat is affecting his erections when they have sex.  I just didn't want to know about that.To be fair, there is one extremely poignant section of the film where he goes into school cafeterias and shows kids choosing pizza, french fries, etc. over healthy meals.  That is a national travesty that should be corrected immediately.  Bravo for that!All in all, though, this film was mostly about a somewhat unlikeable guy packing burgers and fries in his gut and wrecking his body.  I can see that for free, as can you, every day.

The result; his health gets ruined.While Spurlock's experience is not exactly a scientific study you could publish in the Lancet, it is a disturbing examination of what fast food and soft drink are doing to our health.I rarely eat McDonalds (though I enjoy the odd coke) however the restaurant chain is quite popular in Australia, as it is worldwide.  The strength of Mcdonalds and other fast food chains is obviously providing tasty food at low prices very quickly to the consumer.  McDonalds essentially applied the industrial technique of mass production to fast food, and made Ray Kroc (its founder) a fortune.I don't really buy the line that multinational corporations are evil, because they are multinational corporations; we have to remember corporations exist in relation to governments and ultimately consumers, as well as shareholders.  We happily buy coke, McDonalds, cigarettes, and many other things obviously bad for our health, and yet seem to like to blame the company which provides that addictive substance to us when our health goes bad.  In our individualistic culture, we tend to all too readily avoid self-responsibility and the virtue of self-control, and in my view this is part of the reason fast food exists.However, the rocketing levels of obesity, especially amoung children, are of great concern, and it is clear the marketing techniques often aimed at children by fast food companies is at least unethical.  We need to make sure the tide of obesity turns in the negative direction, otherwise this generation risks dying earlier than our parents and grandparents.

770090,A3LU79BYMWZEW9,B0000B1OC4,Gregor von Kallahann,"[6, 9]","Interesting that among the negative reviews below, one poster knocks filmmaker Morgan Spurlock for not acknowledging the complexities of the obesity epidemic, while another chides him for making the matter more complex than it should be--if you overeat, make the wrong food choices and don't exercise, you're going to get fat.  So who's right?  Well, they all are in their way, icluding Spurlock, whose film is plainly not be taken as the last word on this health crisis (his breezy style should suggest as much) but whose basic argument about the risks of overindulging in fast food is far from spurious.One thing the negative reviews seem to have in common is the issue of ""free choice.""  I don't want to be glib here.  There is certainly an argument to be made for the position that those who overindulge in junk food should know the risks they're taking and should assume reponsibility for their lives and health.  On the other hand, as the movie illustrates all too well the pervasiveness of fast food and the advertising thereof makes it difficult, if not impossible, for parents and educators to provide alternative dietary and health information to young children and teens.  Kids--and adults--are bombarded with messages to consume these fun, ""family oriented"" products on a daily basis.  If the sole source of information to the contrary is some drab diet and health brochure that gets passed out in health class, you gotta know who's going to win this battle for the hearts, minds and stomachs of the nation's youth.And let's not kid ourselves about the impressionability of many adults as well.Yes, the obesity epidemic in this country is certainly not entirely due to the ready availability of high fat fast food.  I didn't get the impression that that was Spurlock's point.  He makes no bones about the fact that while he was quite fit prior to conducting this 30-day McDonald's binge experiment, he opted not to exercise significantly during this period as well.  That he would do that skews the results significantly.

This movie is very well produced and is honest about the terrible harm that is done by eating high-fat, high-sodium and high-sugar diets. The movie does not overstate the problem. The problem is real and affects at least 1/3 of all citizens in the USA. That, of course, is a huge number of people.If you are unlucky enough to be overweight or fat you must watch this movie. It is not a pleasant experience. However, if you pay attention to the message in the movie it might save your life.McDonald's position that they are not in any way responsible for this problem, because it is a matter of personal responsibility, is a bunch of hogwash. They have spent over one billion dollars advertising this dangerous food, their clown, their name and have put this food in hospitals and schools. They are a big part of the problem and they are telling wicked lies to say that they are not part of the problem. Personal responsibility is important.

If you're like me, the foray into a fast food joint remains a guilty pleasure that's difficult to resist, especially when our go-go-go lifestyles bleed us of the time and energy to enjoy a normal diet. Thanks to ""Super-Size Me"" finding that when it comes to eating better, it's worth the effort.Spurlock's investigations into the industry provide some of the films strongest points, showing us that it's about as benign as big tobacco. Hopefully this give pause to a public blithely ignorant to what we stuff ourselves with.Spurlock's keen sense of pacing, with generous amounts of humor, made it absolutely fascinating to follow him on his journey into fast-food hell. I was especially captivated by his mood swings and behavioral changes as a result of the obscene amounts of sugar he was consuming. If this is what McDonalds (and its ilk) can do to a nominally healthy, young individual, then I was convinced that I definitely needed to reevaluate what, and how, I eat.""Super-Size Me's"" most alarming moments come when Spurlock undergoes routine and thorough medical tests during his experiment. One of his doctors said that Spurlock's liver was beginning to show evidence of damage usually found among chronic alcohol abusers, and he exhorted him to stop the experiment at once. Another, a nutritionist, I believe, was astonished at how rapidly Spurlock's overall nutritional levels were deteriorating. Finally, an epilogue tells us that after the one-month experiment was over, it took him *6 months* to regain his former health. Whoa.Part educational piece, part war-cry, this film will most likely not be heartily welcomed by avid fast-foodies.

To start with its a documentary of how fast food/junk food is destroying the eating habits and health charts of a high percentage of Americans. I don't live in America but McDonalds and other food chains influence the whole world. The basic story line of this film revolves around a man who was decided to live on McDonalds food(and nothing else) for a period of 30 days. Morgan Spurlock wondered what living on a McDiet would be like.The movie contains more information on nutrition and our daily intakes of highly commercialised products(like Coke, Pepsi, Cereal, Chocolates, Burgers, Fries..) than any other documentary I have ever seen.It's highly informative and enterprising when it comes to attacking McDonalds.I learnt more from SUPER SIZE ME than I have from anything in the 21 years of my nutrition watching life. There are loads of interesting facts, figures, charts, etc. that are detailed out. Morgan Spurlock, a man of above average fitness gains approximately 30+ pounds in 30 days. There is a lot of change in his behavioural pattern,moodswings, random depression cycles,etc.Despite watching this at home, I enjoyed the way the data is represented. I would say that they have gone out of their way in bringing McDonalds a lot of shame but then when you think of junk food you tend to think of McDonalds.

Although it's essentially worthless as a piece of solid scientific research, it makes for weirdly compelling viewing.  Who knew that there were 4 McDonald's per square mile in Manhattan, or that there is actually a guy in America who eats nothing but 3 or 4 Big Macs a day & has a cholesterol level of 140?  Or that an order of McD's french fries will not show any signs of rot after sitting in a glass jar for 10 weeks? (This was actually one of the more disturbing elements for me, seeing as I had eaten an order of their fries shortly before watching this DVD.  They are probably still in there!) As other reviewers have pointed out, Mr. Spurlock went to ridiculous extremes with his food choices & his activity level went to zero after being very active before.  He is shown during only one meal having salad, and the only chicken we see him consume is McNuggets covered in sauce.  Even though he set out to sample everything from the McDonald's menu during the month, he did not HAVE to choose the extra-large fries or the double burger sandwiches twice a day.  He makes no attempt whatsoever not to overeat ridiculous quantities until he memorably pukes out of the window of his car.  A more worthwhile experiment would have been to consume a couple of Extra Value meals a week (an average American amount of fast-food consumption) over the course of a year and track what happened, but then, of course, he wouldn't have had a film that won him a Sundance award.  To give his experiment a whiff of scientific objectivity, Mr. Spurlock consults three doctors & a nutritionist over the course of the 30 days; they express shock over his final numbers, which indicate a massive health crisis on a par with lifelong alcoholic's. Are they being truthful, or have the results been skewed for shock value?  Hard to tell.  It took Spurlock a year to undo the damage this little stunt did to his body, but the fact is, he goes way overboard in his quest to skewer McDonald's.  Curtis Mayfield's song ""Your Pusher"" playing in the background as Ronald McDonald prances on the screen sums up his agenda.  After this film generated so much buzz, the Today show offered a rebuttal of sorts by having a woman on who actually LOST weight on a diet of McDonald's for 30 days.  She did it by choosing the smallest hamburgers & eating a lot of salads.

The subject's health is monitored throughout the documentary.  They also take you on a tour of America's eating habits as well.Of course he gains weight and has health problems as would anyone else eating the amount of fat and sugar that he is consuming.  In 2 other experiments people reproduced this eating more sensibly.  They both lost weight and had improved medical conditions.I watched this right after Fast Food Nation (read my review) and expected even worse from this.  As he takes you through this there is some finger pointing at McDonalds and others in the fast food industry.  For the most part however the documentary lets you draw your own conclusions.  I love McDonalds.  I have been to a McDonalds in 25 different countries.  In all but one case I have found them to be exactly the same high level of quality and standards.  (Karlovy Vary Czech Republic was consistently bad)I think this documentary is more of a commentary on America's poor eating habits and almost non-existent exercise habits.  McDonalds, in my opinion, is as large as it is because we have become a lazy and indulgent society that has lost whatever once made us great.  We are not fat because McDonalds sells us burgers.  If McDonalds did not do it others would.  They simply fill the demands of Americans.  If America went Vegan we would have Vegan restaurants everywhere.Speaking of Vegan, the only real problem I had with this was the subject's Vegan girlfriend.  She had the same moral superiority that I have encountered frequently with Vegetarians and Vegans.  Feel great about it all you want but a well balanced diet including meat is proven to be healthier than vegetarian diets that leave the body wanting for essential proteins and fats.  Also about the sex thing maybe he is finally realizing you are not that attractive and you nagging him about eating meat is annoying him.I do think that the people that are looking for the government for doing something about this problem are wrong.  It is 100% your own responsibility on what you and your family eats. Kids may see 10,000 advertisements per year but to my knowledge none of them can drive themselves or purchase items without an adult.  Americans have already deferred their children's education reponsibilities to the government with devastating results.  Do not put what they eat into their hands as well.Go home and cook a meal for your family and spend time with them.  Find 30 minutes in the day and do some sort of exercise.  Don't allow yourself any excuses just do it.  I have been fat in my life and skinny.  Whatever situation was solely the results of my own actions and nothing else.  Even the busiest of schedules I was able to exercise (or would have been able to find time to).  When I was in the army my friends and I ate fast food 4-5 times a week at least.  Among my friends none were fat and all were in extremely good shape.  None of us had medical problems associated with obesity.  Fast food can fit easily into a diet of healthy people if they exercise.Watch the movie and draw your own conclusions.

We all knew that, man. But the criticisms his methods have met with are unfair.Many people have complained that over-eating is bad for you no matter where you eat from. But Spurlock does not over-eat. He only has 3 square meals a day. Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner. And still he became very unhealthy, rather alarmingly so.The point seems to be lost on most of us though. I don't eat from McDonalds and I won't. But those who do won't stop because they've seen this movie. I'm going to assume this will be the attitude the world over. McDonald's did abolish their Supersize option shortly after the film came out but claimed it was nothing to do with Morgan Spurlock in an attempt to distance itself from this documentary.Spurlock even tries his absolute hardest to get an interview with a high-ranking McDonald's executive but fails miserably. When only serves to prove, even further, how faceless and careless McDonald's is when it comes to public relations.Though Mickey D's is not the only monster to be skewered here. America's health issues and obesity problems in general are tackled by Spurlock. All in a rather cartoony, easy to follow fashion. If overbearing documentaries like F 9/11 put you off the genre then don't worry. Supersize Me is lighter but still as sophisticated and darkly comical.The extras on the DVD are actually quite good.

Some of them seem to identify very strongly with McDonalds and see any attack on the golden arches as an attack on themselves. Others seem to claim that since McDonalds is part of American culture an attack on McDonalds is an attack on the USA. It is funny, since McDonald's most certainly doesn't need anyone to defend them: they have the money to hire the best lawyers and buy the best lobbyists! McDonald's does not care especially about any single client, they do not care about patriotism. And no one could expect them too - they are a company that is supposed to earn money, nothing else.Mr. Spurlock is a very ordinary guy; I went to one of his speeches. He is not a great orator, he is not too articulate, but what he has is that he has something to say. He tried a semi-scientific experiment which very nearly cost him his life.  What struck me was his very ordinariness: he loves a good hamburge, he cracks bad jokes, and even comes out as a bit macho. He is not a radical green vegan feminist. It is his very ordinariness that scares Mcdonald's: he can reach out to their base customers, he speaks their language.McDonald'c can say that they sell 150 million salads a year, but that is nothing compared to the 50 million people the serve per day! They also claim that no one eats all their meals in a week at their restaurants.

Are we saying that before Morgan Spurlock decided to sacrifice his health, nobody knew eating Big Macs three times a day wasn't healthy? Is there something about a Double Quarter-Pounder with cheese that people confused with a salad?I say this documentary is illogical because #1 nobody eats the way this guy did in the documentary. #2, even if they do, they will certainly feel the effects without Spurlock's help. #3 he's stating the obvious. Eating McDonald's three times a day to prove you get fat is like shooting yourself to prove bullets make you bleed. It's stupid, misplaced logic. And I assure you, if a guy made a documentary where he shoots himself multiple times to show the folly of guns, people would rightfully think he was stupid.I'm also deeply bothered by the fact nobody believes in the notion of responsibility and self-accountability. If you make a choice to indulge in unhealthy activities, it's your fault when you get sick. I'm tired of people choosing to smoke, drink, and eat unhealthily then think it's everybody's fault but their own. You have no right to sue a legal business for selling a legal product when you knew that product was unhealthy before you indulged.Now we have the lifestyle police trying to FORCE people to eat healthy by banning vending machines from schools and proposing special taxes on certain foods because of their unhealthiness. With that logic, everything would be taxed except lettuce. People should make healthy choices because they choose to, not because the government and health fanatics are putting guns to their heads. Making the right choice involves getting the correct information and being provided options, not having those options taken away.Put nutrition labels on foods.

Super Size Me is a straight-shooting look at a cynical industry, focusing primarily on McDonalds, It sheds light on a profound problem, only beginning to get at all that's behind the appeal of unhealthy fast food. As protagonist, Spurlock is sincere and likable. He plays it straight, no edge, arrogance or irony - it would have been easy to slip into a smugness that he avoids. And the fact that his doctors actually urge him to abandon his experiment well before its conclusion dramatically underscores the seriousness of the relationship between serious health concerns and processed food, high in refined sugar and saturated fat.Tobacco, drugs and  addiction are all raised in the film in comparison and the connection works, particularly with respect to the ethical indifference of the industries that have peddled their unhealthy products to an all too willing public, long aware of the consequences of prolonged regular use. Those in denial about these concerns will of course see the film as much ado about nothing and/or will attempt to discredit its legitimacy by finding fault with his methods or disputing the credibility of his numbers. The fact remains, however, that the U.S. is, as Spurlock claims, experiencing an epidemic of obesity and its concomitant health risks, along with the exacerbating and increasingly severe lack of physical exercise.There is much to think about in this important movie. And having shown very effectively how clever and thorough the fast food industry is at marketing their products - primarily to children, it is good that we have another perspective to consider.

770108,ABDHAYPNM28US,B0000B1OC4,Jason,"[6, 9]","Watching a video like Morgan Spurlock's ""Super Size Me"" is the kind of thing that really should be required in the schools. With its PG-13 rating, there's no reason not to show it to students in junior- and senior-high school health classes. However, more sensitive souls might want to look away during the gruesome scenes, including Spurlock's vomiting fit and a ""stomach stapling"" surgery scene accompanied by Johann Strauss' ""Blue Danube"" waltz. Without resorting to patronizing pedagogy, the documentary's engaging style seems perfectly suited to ""reach"" adolescents. (Spurlock's opening and conclusion are reminiscent of Michael Moore's films, though he shies away from Moore's guerrilla tactics.) It also works for adults, as the film's reputation attests.Perhaps Spurlock took his experiment to an extreme by eating nothing but McDonald's food for a month. This is just the hook to attract attention to the serious message contained in his entertaining and informative documentary. Like most people, I am aware that fast food isn't exactly the greatest thing for one's body. Over the years, I have absorbed enough information to understand that fast food can't be any kind of dietary staple. However, this 90 minute mix of sounds, images, and information made me think even more about the ramifications the ""grab-n-go"" culture for my health, and for the health of American society.Even though my wife and I mainly shop for organic groceries, I wondered about the subtle effects of the occasional meal at McDonalds, as well as the other ""grab-n-go"" places that provide a quick escape from work or ""nourishment"" on a long trip. Quite frankly, I developed a headache watching this. Perhaps it was the yucky weather outside, or a psychosomatic effect brought on by thinking about whatever might be floating around in my system. Nevertheless, the scrutiny of Spurlock by three doctors, as well as the testimony of legal and health experts (including former Surgeon General David Satcher), makes a convincing case. The implied symbiosis between ""grab-n-go"" culture and corporate interests is also quite compelling, as is the visible deterioration of Spurlock himself during his ""diet.""Although personal responsibility can be a good and life-affirming thing, ""Super Size Me"" examines how the rich and powerful can hide behind such admonishments to the general public while taking only token responsibility themselves. Corporations can run amok in a ""laissez-faire"" environment (well, ""laissez-faire"" for business) by compelling people to work insane hours for barely a living wage, which forces their employees to grab fast and cheap food for ""fuel."" I suppose the big food corporations are ""doing something"" by providing information about their products (like Philip Morris' bizarre ""damage control"" campaign), but they seem apathetic about committing to real change. Of course, better general health would require more substantial changes to culture in general, which seem unlikely anytime soon. After all, it's easy for a physician making good money (and who has leisurely golf dates at the local country club) to shake his finger at an obese person working two minimum wage jobs, and to say that her weight is a ""wake-up call"" to diet and exercise.""Super-sizing"" itself is probably one of the most grotesque aspects of fast food culture: The idea that one can get a greater quantity (never mind quality) of something for just a few cents more. When I worked at McDonalds in my hometown during summers off from college, I had to remember to ask customers if they wanted their meal ""super-sized."" Unless a manager was hovering nearby, I never felt the need to ask this question because (1) I was already busy enough trying to remember the order of the previous customer, (2) we would probably run out of fries sooner and anger more customers needing to ""grab-n-go,"" and (3) they usually asked for a super-sized meal anyway. (A wage of $4.25 an hour also wasn't enough of an incentive to help me remember.) ""Wasting"" unpurchased sandwiches was another odious aspect of the job from all perspectives (moral, environmental, etc.), but that's another story...Among other things, the documentary ends with an updated list of the 10 ""fattest cities"" in the United States. As mentioned earlier in the movie, my adopted state of Texas has many of those cities, with my place of residence (Arlington) ranked at #8. This is understandable, because its layout does not easily facilitate walking to places, and it is the largest city in the U.S. with no public transportation system.As I mentioned earlier, ""Super Size Me"" should be required viewing in the schools. I believe that its visceral presentation of facts would make a greater overall impact than the paternalism of the ill-conceived ""abstinence"" movement; after all, food is easier to get than sex. Related to that, the account of Spurlock's deflated libido (related graphically by his vegan girlfriend Alex) might be incentive enough for teenagers to reconsider bad eating habits. Corporations that have a vested interest in selling cafeteria food might not be very pleased with showing this in the schools, but they should remember that they are not the customers. If an alternative school for low-income troubled youth can provide decent food to their students, why can't other schools?One can hope that ""Super Size Me"" will provide some impetus for change in our health and eating habits, and consequently in our culture to help facilitate better lifestyles. After all, not everyone can get a decent-paying job with reasonable hours in places like Berkeley or Austin. In the meantime, we can hope that the cosmetic changes already implemented by some food corporations will morph into more substantial changes to improve our overall health.",5,"Forget ""Abstinence

770110,A140XH16IKR4B0,B0000B1OC4,Jean E. Pouliot,"[5, 7]","""Super Size Me"" is Morgan Spurlock's funny/serious indictment of the fast food industry. Starting as a reasonably healthy and fit 30-year-old, Spurlock uses himself in an experiment to see how a constant diet of fast food affects people. He chooses to eat McDonald's food for every meal - breakfast, lunch and dinner - for a full month, much to the consternation of his vegan girlfriend and the growing concern of his doctors. Needless to say, the experiment does not go well. How badly it goes is the message of this movie.When ""Super Size Me"" isn't following Spurlock around the country - chronicling every meal, check-up and episode of vomiting - it teaches us about America's casual attitude to a serious health risk in our midst. Spurlock shows us that our children recognize fast food figures like Ronald MacDonald better than the president and religious figures. He graphically demonstrates the amount of fat and sugar hidden in fast food. He even introduces out to some way-out characters, like the man who eats up to nine Big Macs a day and stays pencil slim. ""Super Size Me"" shows us the way that fast food is marketed to kids on TV and at school, how its nutritional value is misrepresented by the industry, and how fast food chains cater eagerly to our insatiable desire for bigger portions of unhealthy food.Spurlock does go over the edge occasionally. I suspect that some of his bad reaction to fast food was due to his lack of experience with it. Going from strict beans-and rice diet to one stuffed with beef, starch, sugar and fat wouldn't agree with anyone's constitution. Still, ""Super Size Me"" ought to be a wake-up call to those of us who rely heavily on the fast food industry to feed our families and who are susceptible to the indestry's siren call for ever larger and ever less nutritious offerings.

Most vivid was his upset doctor informing him that the damage he was doing was similar to that of an alcoholic.

(In the end, it took him 6 months of healthy eating to lose all of the weight he gained in those 30 days.)In between meals, Spurlock did a wonderful job of reporting on the insidiousness of fast-food companies to infiltrate school lunchrooms and hook kids, guaranteeing future business.  Subtly slipped in here and there were hideously obese people patronizing McDonalds and working there.Also interesting was the bonus material of cut scenes and interviews, each of which could have been blended into the main film.

770113,A2V3P1XE33NYC3,B0000B1OC4,Jeffrey Leach,"[1, 3]","I recently went out to eat with my girlfriend, not to McDonalds thankfully, and couldn't help but notice how many of my fellow diners were overweight. We're talking grossly overweight, too, not just a few pounds gained over the holidays. One family eating together at the next table over--father, mother, two sons, and daughter--was scarily obese. I probably wouldn't have noticed if I hadn't recently watched Glen Spurlock's scathing documentary on America's problem with the unwanted pounds, ""Super Size Me,"" but the fact that I did notice nearly every person in this restaurant looked like a diabetes risk speaks volumes about the relevancy of this film. America has a big problem with obesity, a problem that various medical associations and watchdog groups claim will eventually lower the life expectancy for the first time in generations. In other words, the kids of today will actually live fewer years than their parents and their grandparents. Scary, isn't it? And Spurlock's documentary is just the latest to sound the warning bell on this troubling trend. That he does so with a sort of graveyard humor shouldn't take away in the slightest from the bottom line: America is fat and will pay a price for its libertine ways.Spurlock assigned himself a troubling mission: for an entire month he would eat at McDonalds. Every breakfast, lunch, and dinner would come wrapped in paper or cellophane topped off with French fries and a soda pop. Moreover, anytime the cashier asked Spurlock if he wanted to ""super size"" his meal, he said yes. Anyone who remembers a super size portion at McDonalds will understand what a daunting task this documentarian faced. Spurlock, convinced that a diet of nothing but McDonalds for a month would have some negative consequences to his well being, first went to a series of doctors to have his vitals measured. He returned to the physicians at various times throughout his little test, and the results were truly shocking. Not only did he gain weight, rather obvious considering his high fat diet, but other troubling problems arose. Most problematic was the result of double cheeseburgers and breakfast muffins on his liver. One of his doctors began issuing dire warnings about the state of his organ, claiming that if Spurlock continued on this path his liver might shut down entirely. Incredibly, Glen Spurlock continued chowing down all-beef patties and gallons of soda pop even when faced with such alarming evidence. True to his mission or stupid? You decide.""Super Size Me"" is much more than a mere document outlining one man's quest to prove that eating at McDonalds can cause permanent physical damage. Spurlock intersperses his jaunts to the local restaurant with interviews and road trips. He talks to Big Mac aficionado and all-around weirdo Don Gorske, who has eaten several of the huge sandwiches everyday for decades. He talks to a fitness coach named Phil Lawler about the dearth of physical education courses in today's schools. And he discusses the scurrilous effects of marketing junk food with supermarket guru Phil Lempert. We see our man visit a shop that deep-fries any type of food you can think of, from twinkies to chocolate bars. There is also a visit to a private museum consisting of nothing but McDonalds's memorabilia as well as a disturbing jaunt into a local school system to see what's on a typical day's lunch menu. I couldn't believe the junk kids at school can eat today! Wow! When I went to school in the 1980s we couldn't even have pop let alone various meals catered by local fast food restaurants. The highlight in my high school's cafeteria was spaghetti day, and the pasta was definitely not from a local restaurant.I enjoyed ""Super Size Me,"" and considering that most of what we see here also appears in other documentaries about the dangers of excessive eating and the general lack of exercise currently plaguing the country, I don't think Spurlock is a propagandist. At first, I thought the documentary was going to be a hatchet job. Why? The presence of Spurlock's vegetarian girlfriend Alex Jamieson cast serious doubts on whether this would be an unbiased documentary. My concerns were laid to rest, however, when I learned that Alex is one of the most irritating individuals I've seen in a film and when I saw that Spurlock didn't totally buy into her ideas of what is or isn't healthy to eat. In fact, Glen comments quite frequently that he likes the food at McDonalds. Obviously, there are people who will say that ""Super Size Me"" is a muckraking documentary and will never accept evidence to the contrary. They have a point in that Spurlock singles out McDonalds for special attention. What about the danger posed by Burger King, Pizza Hut, or a number of other big fast food chains? I think it is safe to assume that these restaurants pose the same sorts of risks, and I would like to see more about them.Pay attention to the special features on the DVD. An interview with Eric Schlosser, author of the now seminal ""Fast Food Nation,"" calls attention to some aspects of the fast food industry missing in the documentary. I wasn't particularly enamored with Schlosser's book when I read it three or four years ago, but he does have some important insights to offer here. Too, a feature called ""The Smoking Fry"" will definitely have you wondering what the heck McDonalds puts into its French fries in order to keep them fresh. Apparently, plastic isn't the only substance that will never break down into its component parts. I heartily recommend ""Super Size Me"" to anyone who eats fast food more than once a week.",5,Entertaining even as it delivers scares,1112486400,"04 3, 2005",2005,5606,"['recently', 'went', 'eat',

Of his self-imposed restrictions, he can't eat the same thing until he has tried all the items on the menu, and if he is asked to super-size the meal, then he will do so.  Throughout the film, he speaks with doctors who monitor his progress.  The doctors, and we the viewers, are surprised at the results (although we could figure out the weight gain).This movie will make you think about your own nutritional choices.

I picked this up after hearing a lot of the press, and I expected to be following director/star Spurlock around as he ate McDonald's food three times per day for 30 days.  I was pleasantly surprised to find that his journey and the resulting film offers much, much more than just a story about a man who eats a lot of junk food.  Spurlock's journey is the glue that holds together a film that features many facts about diet and exercise, interviews with experts and industry insiders, a look at how fast food is marketed to children, a look at the school lunch industry, and much more.We all know fast food is bad.  Spurlock's three doctors who monitored him before, during, and after his little experiement knew it was bad.  They just didn't know how bad.  They didn't realize they'd be begging him to stop his silly experiment because it was ruining his health at a rate they never expected.  This is eye opening for anyone who thinks fast food is ""bad,"" because the truth is a lot deeper than just that.Are people right to be suing the fast food industry for their health problems?  Spurlock does not answer that question, but he gives you a lot of data for you to make up your mind.  Prepare to have your eyes opened!Now that this film has made it through the circuit and it out on DVD, time has passed, and we can see the impacts.  McDonald's no longer offers their menu items in ""super size"" (this happened 2 months after the film came out, but McDonald's denies any connection).  With the raised awareness, people started looking for alternatives to fries, and McDonald's now offers fruit and salads as combo meal alternatives.  Let's hope that we've hit rock bottom and the changes continue to come, so that in 25 years this will be a picture of ""the way we were.""The DVD extras are definite must-sees.

Obesity is complicated, but there's no question that taking in more calories than you use is cause. Morgan Spurlock in this film and ""Fast Food Nation"" told us something we all knew.This film is pretty gross, to put it mildly. Just looking at the food made me feel queasy--imagine eating it all the time! Spurlock's medical team never imagined the damage that the food would cause to his body, and it took a lot longer than a month to reverse. The most telling part of the film for me was simply watching the expressions on Spurlock's face as he grew lethargic and depressed, then hyper after eating.

To me on an entertainment level this was way better than any action movie. This was real & immediate. He did have some rules. He had to sample at least once every thing Mickie D had to offer. He'd supersize only when asked. He would try to eat three times a day. Wisely, he had a good support system. He employed a number of medical specialist. Most important of all was his girl friend. She must really love him. They were all concerned that he might not make it to 30 days with out some really bad medical complications. He had to give in at one point switching to water instead of other beverages. This was permissible as Mickie D sells bottled water.Boomers have been eating this stuff most of their lives & in massive quantities it is so ubiquitous.

It's got circumstantial evidence that any moron can put together to conclude that fatty and sugar-infested fast foods are dangerous and have a negative effect on people who eat them.

After watching it, I wasn't certain what the intended point of the documentary was. To tell us that we live in the most obese country in the world? Most of us already know that. Was it to tell us that McDonald's doesn't serve healthy food? Anyone that's within a hair's breadth of sanity knows that already. Ultimately, while I did enjoy it, I felt that this was a shockumentary, and upon reading that Spurlock was denied into USC's film school five times, I have a better understanding of why he may have made the film.

I'm salivating just thinking about it - with fries, of course.SUPER SIZE ME is an absorbing and informative documentary ostensibly targeting McDonald's as the purveyors of nutritionally nasty food that's undermining the foundations of global health. Writer/director Morgan Spurlock volunteered himself to eat nothing but McDonald's fast food for thirty consecutive days while having his physical health and blood chemistries monitored by medical and dietary professionals. Morgan had several self-imposed ""rules"". He had to eat all three daily meals at the chain, consume every item on the Golden Arches menu at least once, and agree to ""supersize"" his order if asked by the sales clerk. Morgan sampled outlets across the U.S., including California, Texas, Ohio, and New York.By Day Thirty, Spurlock had gained 27 pounds while driving his liver enzymes, cholesterol, and triglycerides levels up into the heart palpitations range. But, over and above documenting this personal self-abuse, Spurlock mainly examines the effects of fast food on the nation's young - the insidious insinuation of the stuff into school lunch programs, and the wickedly pervasive advertising by the evil fast food giants designed to hook children for life before the inevitable triple bypass. The documentary visually reinforces the message with shot after shot of grossly overweight citizens both behind and in front of the McDonald's cash registers.For all its slick presentation, one is left with the unanswerable question, ""OK, so now what?"" Do governments - local, state, and federal - pass laws prohibiting the sale of the classic cheeseburger/fries/Coke meal? And what about pizza, my own personal favorite that I'd eat three times a day - with a fried chicken chaser - if I could get away with it? Haven't we already tried that approach with alcohol, drugs, prostitution, and porn?

And what's more, Ronald and co. certainly don't want you to know about it.This film is an at times disturbing, at time hilarious look at what's making this country so flippin' fat. It's the gigantic portions of junk that passes for food from fast-food restaurants. Being a vegan, I felt, even before watching this, that I had dodged a major bullet with regard to the inherent health risks in eating this way. After watching Super Size Me, I wanted to send a copy of this film to everyone that I care about.Morgan Spurlock decided to eat an all-McDonalds diet for an extended period of time, in order to see what possible adverse health risks could develop. What happened was worse than what the experts predicted. He gained a lot of weight, and his cholesterol level skyrocketed. Apparently, he even feared continuing the diet due to the results of being a Big Mac Junkie.The film also discusses how public schools are being infiltrated by fast-food (which is an indictment on that industry, as well as the failure of local, state, and federal government), and it shows how, by adopting a healthy menu, school's can still remain fiscally solvent.Super Size Me demonstrates how fast-food chains manipulate children by offering toys, playgrounds and cartoons, as well as the unholy marriage between fast-food and Corporate America. The interview with the industry lobbyist is very telling.The extras are very interesting, too. If you've ever wondered how long it takes for McDonalds fries to decompose, the answer might shock you! There is also an interview with the author of Fast-Food Nation, which, incidentally, is the perfect companion to Super Size Me.Let's wake up and slim down America.

He did so because of the rather absurd claim by the McDonald's Corporation that their food could be part of a healthy diet.  With the aid of three doctors and a nutritionist, Morgan Spurlock embarked on this diet in order to see the effects it would have on his body.  After 30 days, Spurlock gained 25 lbs, doubled his cholesterol and triglycerides, not to mention the fact that he began to show signs of liver failure.  Of course, this is not enough to create a whole feature film, so Spurlock spends time exploring how fast food has entered our schools and how they have lied about or tried to hide the health content of their food.  This is a great film although it does hae a hint of bias that a true documentary would strive to eliminate.  That should not take away from the fact that the film does have an important message that should be taken seriously.

770136,AQ5UQXDIJA3R8,B0000B1OC4,"J. Tucker ""datashogun""","[4, 7]","...to warrant the 4 stars.  I see many reviews referring to the bias inherent in this documentary.  Yes, it's biased--the creator was motivated by the problems that giant, gloabal corporations and brand marketing have created for average people.  If you look at the first few minutes of this film, you should immediately think of Schlosser's ""Fast Food Nation"" or Naomi Klein's ""No Logo."" In my view this bias (wanting to inform and motivate normal people) motivated me to watch the film, so I was fine with it.Here's the heart of what Spurlock is trying to show--McDonald's is spending MILLIONS of dollars to convince people that the way of life it represents is wholesome and family friendly.  By setting up play structures and advertising with clowns, McDonald's and other fast food chains actually outflank parents in their efforts to feed their kids healthy food.We should all understand that (a) no physician would ever advocate what Spurlock tried, nor would they see his activities as a model of ""normal consumption"" for others, and (b) those reviewers who claim that individuals need make smart choices about what they put in their own bodies are right.  But do these two assertions imply that (a) average people aren't consuming too much fast food, or that (b) all of the reasons for their consumption are within their control?Here's my take: think of the daily choice to (not) consume fast food as an exam.  In school, when an instructor administers an exam, (s)he expects a normal distribution of results. If the final grades are distributed normally, (s)he can therefore conclude that the scores the students earned relfected their talent, preparation, and motivation.  If instead, 90% of the students  fail the exam, the instructor would ask questions. Was the exam biased? Were my teaching methods effective? Were the testing conditions fair? Etc. If the instructor concludes that the test was biased for some reason, (s)he would likely toss those results, and give a new test INSTEAD OF JUMPING TO CONCLUSIONS ABOUT THE STUDENTS. To go back to fast food: if so many people are becoming obese and experiencing other health related issues in direct correlation with the growth of the fast food industry in this country, is it _possible_ that there may be some factors outside of their control that are influencing their choices? And if these factors do exist (advertising, product placement, taste engineering, etc.), would it be worthwhile to address them in some way?Schlosser and Spurlock are basically arguing the same thing: Fast food's marketing practices create an unhealthy and unfair environment for people making choices about consuming fast food. In Spurlock's case he literally shows you some of the possible harm of overconsumption by subjecting his body to a month of McDonald's (he's got more courage than I have, I'll admit). He goes from a guy who literally can't hold down a supersized meal (yes--you see the full technicolor yawn when he tries to eat a double qtr-lb'r meal), to a guy who can't give it up. Hopefully his experiences will help counter-balance the effects of much of that marketing. It's gross, but effective. And personally, I found the comments by his girlfriend about their...intimate relations to be strong motivation to stay out of McDonald's!But the true treasure on the DVD is Spurlock's interview of Schlosser. It's like witnessing the formation of the ""Justice League"". Just watching these two bounce thoughts and experiences off of each other was incredible.  In retrospect, had I seen this interview, and discovered that the movie itself was damaged, I still would have rated this DVD 4 stars.See the film for yourself.

770144,AYCJSA9HR7TKO,B0000B1OC4,Kerry Walters,"[4, 6]","What an incredible film!  In order to put a human face on the epidemic of obesity, which is fast becoming one of the nation's biggest killers and is contributed to in a major way by fast food, Morgan Spurlock decides to eat nothing for 30 straight days but McDonald's food.  There are two rules to the experiment:  he can eat ONLY what's on McD's menu, and he must take supersize orders whenever the cashier asks him if he ""wants that supersized.""  At the beginning of the 30 days, he has all his vitals checked by a number of health professionals, including a cardiologist, gastroenterologist, family practitioner, and a diet specialist.At the end of the experiment, he's gained 30 pounds and his liver is backing up on him.  He feels and looks like crap, and all of the medical people monitoring his health tell him that he's killing himself.  It takes him almost a year to detox.The obvious point is that fast food is a killer.  Granted, very few eat as much of the stuff as Spurlock did during his 30-day binge, but most people admit to eating the stuff more than once a week.  Diet experts interviewed in the film argue that even this is way too much.  The simple fact is that fast food portions are getting larger and larger, fat and sugar and sodium is higher and higher, butts and bellies are getting more and more bloated, and arteries and livers--you don't even want to know.One of the most frightening aspects of the film is the hold that McD's has on the nation's youth.  Two scenes in particular suggest how effective McD's advertizing machine is.  In one, primary school kids can identify a picture of Ronald McDonald, but not Jesus or George Washington.  In another, a chorus of school younsters are singing a stupid but influential jingle over and over:  ""Pizza Hut, Pizza Hut, Kentucy Fried Chicken and Pizza Hut!  McDonald's, McDonald's!""  When they get to the ""McDonald's"" part, they form the golden arches with their hands.  And who says that advertizing to the tune of billions of dollars isn't effective?Watch this film, read Eric Schlosser's _Fast Food Nation_, and swear off profit-driven mcfood groups.",5,"Your basic  Mcfood groups:  sugar, salt, fat",1093737600,"08 29, 2004",2004,2127,"['What', 'incredible', 'film', 'order', 'put', 'human', 'face', 'epidemic', 'obesity', 'fast', 'becoming', 'one', 'nation', 'biggest', 'killers', 'contributed', 'major', 'way', 'fast', 'food', 'Morgan', 'Spurlock', 'eat', 'nothing', '30', 'straight', 'days', 'McDonald', 'food', 'are', 'two', 'rules', 'experiment', 'can', 'eat', 'ONLY', 'what', 'McD', 'menu', 'must', 'take', 'supersize', 'orders', 'whenever', 'cashier', 'supersized', 'beginning', '30', 'days', 'vitals', 'checked', 'number', 'health', 'professionals', 'including', 'cardiologist', 'gastroenterologist', 'family', 'practitioner', 'diet', 'specialist.At', 'end', 'experiment', 'gained', '30', 'pounds', 'liver', 'backing', 'up', 'crap', 'medical', 'people', 'monitoring', 'health', 'tell', 'killing', 'almost', 'year', 'detox.The', 'obvious', 'point', 'fast', 'food', 'killer', 'Granted', 'very', 'few', 'eat', 'much', 'stuff', 'Spurlock', 'did', '30-day', 'binge', 'most', 'people', 'admit', 'eating', 'stuff', 'more', 'once', 'week', 'Diet', 'experts', 'interviewed', 'film', 'argue', 'even', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'simple', 'fact', 'fast', 'food', 'portions', 'are', 'getting', 'larger', 'larger', 'fat', 'sugar', 'sodium', 'higher', 'higher', 'butts', 'bellies', 'are', 'getting', 'more', 'more', 'bloated', 'arteries', 'livers', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'want', 'know.One', 'most', 'frightening', 'aspects', 'film', 'hold', 'McD', 'nation', 'youth', 'Two', 'scenes', 'particular', 'suggest', 'how', 'effective', 'McD', 'advertizing', 'machine', 'one', 'primary', 'school', 'kids', 'can', 'identify', 'picture', 'Ronald', 'McDonald', 'not', 'Jesus', 'George', 'Washington', 'chorus', 'school', 'younsters', 'are', 'singing', 'stupid', 'influential', 'jingle', 'Pizza', 'Hut', 'Pizza', 'Hut', 'Kentucy', 'Fried', 'Chicken', 'Pizza', 'Hut', 'McDonald', 'McDonald', 'When', 'get', 'McDonald', 'part', 'form', 'golden', 'arches', 'hands', 'who', 'advertizing', 'tune', 'billions', 'dollars', ""n't"", 'effective', 'Watch', 'film', 'read', 'Eric', 'Schlosser', '_Fast', 'Food', 'Nation_', 'swear', 'off', 'profit-driven', 'mcfood', 'groups']",N/A

I've also been very fond of the sandwich it describes.  As a matter of fact, I enjoy a lot of things on McDonald's menu.  ""Super Size Me"" introduces us to the ugly side of those loveable golden arches and that friendly-faced clown spokesman they call Ronald.  Morgan Spurlock goes on a diet most of us fat folks would love to be put on in this documentary which sets out to show us how bad Mickey D's and fast food in general really are for us.Spurlock goes on an all McDonald's diet for thirty days and, surprisingly, his health and mental structure turn into mush.  Spurlock has an interesting and fun way of providing us with the dark truth.  Just watching this guy cram a Filet-O-Fish into his mouth and gulping a super-size Coke is rather hideous.  We see him go from a fairly fit human being to one of us(us being the good fatties of the world).  His condition does become potentially deadly near the end of his diet, but I think that is because he(being skinny in the beginning) didn't allow his body to evolve into the well-oiled(or just plain oily) machine that is a fat person.Though some of the information is disturbing to learn, there really is nothing new here.  I believe that it's pretty safe to say that most people already knew that fast food was bad for them.  This movie merely puts the numbers in front of our swollen guts.  Spurlock does show how many of these fast food chains have infiltrated the public school system and also gives us a good explanation on how much money these companies plunk down for advertising.I'm giving it four stars because it is interesting to watch, and Spurlock is a likeable fellow.  I especially enjoyed his adventures in Texas, the state that boasts some of the fattest cities in the U.S.  I guess things really are bigger in Texas!  (Before I get any nasty comments, I really love Texas.  It's my second favorite state behind my home of Louisiana.)As stated before, there isn't much here that hasn't been said about fast food.  Also, common sense should tell you that this stuff isn't that healthy, but it tastes sooooo good.Rent it before you buy it, it might be a little too honest for some.P.S.  Five stars to the Big Mac.

770147,A6ADO7B6FUVN,B0000B1OC4,"Kim Anehall ""www.cinematica.org""","[0, 3]","Images from the TV spew out millions of commercials each year and many of them are in regards to high sugar, high fat and high cholesterol foods.  These commercials use happy and playful themes often directed towards children, which raises the question do the children purchase these food items?  Why would big multibillion dollar companies aim there attention to the children of today?  Could it be that they are interested in investing in the adults of tomorrow?  Why is it that these companies have high sugar, fat, and cholesterol in the food items they advertise and sell?  These questions are answered in Morgan Spurlock's documentary Super Size Me, which is an in-your-face depiction of the unhealthy food that is sold through many of the fast food restaurants throughout America.The McDonald's spokesman has said that it is possible to eat responsibly at McDonald's, and the food has what is required for a balanced nutritional diet.  Despite this, America has turned out to become the fattest country in the world where obesity has lead to an avalanche of cardiovascular disease, which has become one of the major killers of American citizens.  Morgan Spurlock decides to bring on the multibillion dollar corporation McDonald's and see if what the company says is true.  The purpose of choosing McDonald's as the fast food eatery is that they have far more eateries around the world and in America than any other fast food chain.  Thus, Morgan says lets bring them on by eating three meals a day at the golden arches establishments for 30 days.Before commencing the one-tracked McDonald's diet Morgan does it with a scientific approach as he visits with three different doctors where two are specialists in fields related to what happens in the body when food is ingested.  Morgan also visits with several professionals in the field of exercise and nutrition in order to get proper measurements of the body prior the McDonald's experiment begins. The conclusion that all of the involved parties get from examining Morgan before the Mickey-D's diet is that he is in good health and above average physical condition.  In order to control the experiment Morgan decides that he should be as American as possible, he also researches how much daily exercise the average American acquires, which is about 5000 steps per day.Throughout the 30-day journey of ingesting only McDonald's the audience is to follow Morgan, as he gains approximately one pound per day.  In addition, Morgan begins to suffer from several different side effects from the diet such as high increases in blood pressure, cholesterol increases above what is recommended, skin changes to an unhealthy look, mood swings,  lack of energy, chest pains, drastic changes in sex life, and liver toxicity.  Despite these negative physical, psychological, and social affects he reminds the audience that he feels better whenever he ingests another meal from McDonald's.  This gives an indication similar to the one of heavy drug users feel when they have been on a drug and the body requires a new fix in order to return to what feels like a bodily equilibrium.There are several moments when Morgan visits with his doctors and professionals who are amazed by the negative influence the McDonald's diet has one him.  They all urge him to stop the diet, and warn him if he feels in certain ways that he must call 911, or seek medical attention at once.  One of the doctors is amazed that this high fat diet affects the liver in the same way that heavy alcohol abuse does over a prolonged time.  Nonetheless, Morgan endures to continue his experiment, as he seems determined to finish what he started.During negative affects of the McDonald's diet Morgan ventures throughout America where he visits schools where he addresses the poor nutritional diet while also displaying the positive change in an Appleton, WI, school for troubled kids where the employees noticed a significant change when they moved to a well-balanced organic diet with no pre-made meals or soda.  Morgan meets with kids whom he quizzes on if they know who the person on a picture is, and most kids did not know who George Washington was while immediately they recognized Ronald McDonald and Wendy's Pippi Longstocking looking character.  There is also a scene where a man who used to drink enormous quantities of soda is about to have a surgery to reduce the size of his stomach  This man tells his story, as he recalls a moment when he lost his vision at work, which was directly related to ingesting the large quantities of soda as he has developed diabetes.  Interchanging between interviews and visits Morgan jokes by talking directly into the camera about how he is feeling the affects of the McDonald's diet.Super Size Me is documentary that should have been done fifteen years ago, but it is better late than never.  The film is not an attack on only McDonald's, but corporations preying on society and future generations by encouraging them to eat poor nutritional diets through high sugar, high fat, and high cholesterol foods.  This is in a society where physical education has drifted into the back seat of spending more time reading and doing math.  Not that reading and math is not important, but actual research has provided insights that physical activity promotes neural connections in the brain, which speeds reactions and cognitive processes.  In disregard to such research Physical Education has fallen behind, as the American society seems to have gotten denser and fatter.  Physical education could also teach students what to do at home after school and later in life to maintain a healthy lifestyle, which could help cut massive amounts of dollars lost due to illness related to inactivity, obesity, and poor nutrition.Super Size Me raises a number of questions such as why have long-term goals been often forgotten and only quick solutions are targeted, e.g., prepping for test scores and not learning for knowledge and wisdom? Should math and reading be taught at the expense of health?  Should organizations that have an interest in profiting from the American population by decreasing its overall health be allowed to lobby in Washington, D.C. and other places?  As this documentary points out, more is not better.  Maybe society needs a little time to find a good middle ground where the future of America can restore its health and academic achievement for future generations.",4,Fast Food - Weight Gain - Health

Starting with that foundation, it is far easier to appreciate this movie for the data within. Whether or not the director is trying to push some personal agenda, there is a good deal of excellent information to be gleaned. While the scene from the initial consumption of a super-sized meal may have been staged, I don't think it is outside the realm of possibility. I don't mind admitting that it's my favorite scene in the movie. I think it encapsulates the film quite effectively- be it gratuitous or not. I also think it is absolutely hilarious and presents an enlightening message to the viewers.Many have questioned the director's motives. However, I believe that these arguments are completely irrelevant. If you're sufficiently enlightened to cast judgment then you should likewise be savvy enough to accept the information in the context under which it is provided. I think the director is rather forthright in his presentation of the subject. There's a lot to be had here. The subject is presented clearly enough that anyone with above a room-temperature IQ should be able to see through any claimed subterfuge.A great many arguments have been proffered regarding the conditions under which this ""experiment"" was performed. However, I don't feel that the author has hid any material factors. If the author's goal was to address every possibility he'd never finish writing the script. I think he did a great job with the subject. I think the fact that he was in good health to start with was invaluable to the message. I mean, the guy put his health on the line and all we can do is find fault?The bottom line is that there is a great deal to be taken from this movie.

However, rarely does a film succeed in changing things the way this little movie did and contntinues to do so.By now you must know this movie is one filmmaker's personal journey through fast food America, living for 30 days on McDonald's and ""super sizing"" every meal when requested. His health deteriorates and he is a changed man 30 days later, a testimony to the changes fast food has wrought on America.While this film brought great respect and admiration to one filmmaker, it did far more -- it changed the way American fast food operates. In effect, ""SuperSize Me"" coalesced three forces in American society and brought them immediately to the attention of the public and boards of directors of America's fast food delivery agents. Those forces are:-- A staggering increase in the levels of obesity in American children.-- A growing knowledge that most poor children receiving national health care, or Medicaid, eat French fries almost every day.-- Warnings by offialdom in American government to change the dietary habits of newborns and children, leaning out the fat and loading up on vegetables and other nonfat foods that aid growth and development.These events all coalesced around the release of this remarkable little film, which did more than anything in history to document the nutritional failure of fast food and its ""super size me"" culture. Even though the company denied it, there was no coincidence that McDonald's went to a healthier menu immediately upon release of this movie and now aggressively promotes healthier alternatives in its food offerings.The rest of fast food America gathered in lockstep and followed the giant's lead by adding salads, carrots and other low fat high nutrition menu items and recommending replacement of French fries as their staple food item.We all owe enterprising filmmaker Morgan Spurlock a great debt of gratitude for exposing unnutritional American habits in a way that is funny, entertaining and interesting. This movie grips you from the very beginning and doesn't relent, all the time entertaining while exposing. The DVD offering includes extra footage on the changes in fast food culture that double the message of the movie.Here is indeed a moment in time when pop culture America changed health America in a very positive way.

770157,A2NQUGGYM0DBM1,B0000B1OC4,L.A. Scene,"[2, 5]","It's not often that Documentary films get the recognition and publicity of the big theater releases, but ""Super Size Me"" is one that did.  The reason for this is that on the surface, it touches a topic that in one way or another hits just everyone - McDonalds.  I think one way or another, McDonalds Restaurants impact us:  whether we like the food;  whether we detest the food;  whether we see another restaurant at every intersection and street corner; whether our children beg us to go there; or whether we are just sick of their advertising - McDonalds seems to hit close to home.  Another key element to this documentary is the Director Morgan Spurlock - who also is the Narrator and a Subject of the film's investigation.  Spurlock not only brings an interesting topic to film, but also uses his personality to make this an interesting and entertaining film to audiences.On the surface, the premise of this documentary is that Morgan Spurlock is going to look at the impacts of eating nothing but McDonald's food for a period of 30 days.  Spurlock shows how doing this has had a negative impact on his body.  Before embarking on the experiment, Spurlock consults with medical doctors, a dietician, and personal trainer and is assessed in perfect health and fitness.  During the course of the film, we see how Spurlock will undergo both physical and mental changes.  The physical changes include a rapid weight gain, headaches, cholesterol  increases, and an increase in fat in the liver.  We see mood swings and a decrease in energy by Spurlock.  However, this study is basically one way to further investigate a deeper topic - Obesity.The topic of Obesity seems to be something that Spurlock is looking to gain attention.  It is pointed out that Smoking and Obesity are the two top causes of preventable death.  There is a lot of comparisons  done to the Tobacco industry.  The Tobacco industry has gotten a lot of publicity in recent years in regards to the impacts it has had on society. There was a lawsuit against the Tobacco Industry on the impacts that Tobacco and Smoking have had on people.  Spurlock does an excellent job at starting the movie by mentioning the lawsuit that two people filed against McDonalds on the negative impact of the film.  Spurlock pointed out how the Judge in that case said if the two people can prove that there is a direct tie to McDonalds food, then they have a claim.  This becomes the premise of Spurlock's experiment.The way this film was constructed is very good.  As mentioned, Spurlock opens the film with the McDonalds Lawsuit- and this becomes the basis for his experiment.  We are then treated to a very entertaining chronicle of Spurlock's experiment.  This is where Spurlock himself becomes a key part of why this documentary is good.  Spurlock isn't a tight and stiff doctor or scientist and he isn't a stuffy filmmaker - he simply comes across as an everyday guy.  What is nice is that he is going to tell the story in his own words - and he interjects the right sense of humor at the right times.  Interspersed between the experiment are several periphery topics related to Obesity and the Fast Food industry.  These informative topics include:  The Lawsuit Itself; a look at ""Super Sized"" Fast Food portions; Impact of Obesity on Health Problems; and a very entertaining short animation of Chicken McNuggets.There are also some other topics interspersed that are clearly worth mentioning.  He looks at the impacts of obesity and nutrition on the younger generation.  He discusses how not just the fast food industry, but how Candy Companies and Cereal Companies target their marketing audience toward youngsters.  This provides a nice segue into how children are getting nutrition outside the home (i.e. school).  Spurlock does a nice piece on looking into School Nutrition and how some of these programs are as tainted as the Fast Food Industry itself.  Spurlock will look at a how one food company is contracted with a lunch program that is also used in the prison system.  He will also look at how a Federal USDA Program also drops the ball in terms of nutrition.  Finally he will look at one school that is doing school lunches ""the right way"".There are some other highlights:  Spurlock's attempts to get ""interviews"" with the corporate hoods at McDonalds; Spurlock's attempt to locate nutritional information at many of the McDonalds; Features that include comments from John Robbins of Baskin-Robbins Ice Cream, Jared Fogle (the Subway Spokesperson), and Eric Gorske (who has eaten 19,000+ Big Macs in his lifetime).  There is also an interesting twist to the story - Spurlock's girlfriend is a vegan chef. It's entertaining how she reacts to the whole experiment.I also like how Spurlock takes us on a cross-country journey.  While the experiment starts and ends in New York City - Spurlock takes us to Los Angeles, Texas, Illinois, and Washington D.C.It's hard to say how accurate an experiment Spurlock conducts in this film.  Basically you are going to have to take the word of Spurlock himself and the doctors in this film.  Spurlock does set up some ground rules for the experiment that he has to abide by - and he does seem to follow them. While we know that Spurlock is doing this for his meals, what we aren't told is how Spurlock is handling his mid-meal snacking.  Is he still eating McDonalds food in-between meals?  I'm also wondering if he did target certain meals to create a true month-long ""fast food"" binge.  While I do raise these questions, I am not disputing many of the facts that Spurlock brings up in this film.  He raises a lot of interesting points and brings them to the forefront.Overall, this is an outstanding and entertaining documentary.  This is one to be watched many times over.

Bernabo,"[10, 14]","Actually the cover shot of Morgan Spurlock with a load of McDonald's french fries crammed into his mouth is a picture of the writer-director of this 2004 documentary taking good care of his health.  That is because when you watch the bonus features on the DVD version of ""Super Size Me"" the last one is a look at ""The Smoking Fry,"" which strongly suggests that the other thing beside cockroaches that will survive a nuclear holocaust might be the french fries they serve at McDonalds.""Super Size Me"" follows Spurlock through a thirty-day period in which he eats nothing but food served at McDonalds.  The research question is what happens to an average adult American male when he sticks to this sort of a diet.  Spurlock has a team of doctors and nutritionists who detail exactly what happens to him, and let me just say by way of understatement that very little of it is good (eating food to avoid headaches could be considered a good thing).  In between the three visits each day to McDonalds (except when Spurlock has his food delivered), the documentary explores the history and the psychology of the American love affair with fast food.  One of the documentary's sub-plots, as it were, is a lawsuit against McDonalds claiming it is responsible for the obesity of two teenage girls.  That lawsuit inspired Spurlock's grand experiment, and I cannot help but think that according to the American legal system the worst thing McDonalds has ever done was serve hot coffee.The camera shows Spurlock at the low points of his odyssey, from the rectal exam and the vomiting brought on by eating an entire super sized meal in 5 minutes, to his girlfriend critiquing the changes in their sex live and the doctors who try to talk him out of continuing his ""diet.""  In addition to what it does to Spurlock's body, the most damning evidence in ""Super Size Me"" comes from the simple evidence that we are living in a fast food culture.  Adult Americans might not know the Pledge of Allegiance, but they can sing about what you get in a Big Mac.  Even little kids know who Ronald McDonald is, even if they have no idea who is the guy Spurlock is showing them that is NOT George W. Bush.  This is not a high tech documentary and Spurlock never really gets the chance to confront a spokesman from McDonalds to spring a Michael Moore-like trap.They say that McDonald's cancelled its ""Super Size"" program in the wake of Spurlock's documentary, and it would be nice to think that there is a causal link here.  But when you consider that during the 30 day period Spurlock was only asked if he wanted to super size his order six times, the better explanation might be that McDonalds could not get its own employees to support the program.  When you look at some of the deleted scenes and other interviews you realize Spurlock could have gone overboard on his indictment of McDonalds and fast food (the McDonalds Project is a great example of how wickedly funny social art can be), but clearly in the end what it did to his body as he ate in 30 days the same amount of fast food that the average American consumes in 8 years, is enough to do the trick.You will not want to eat as McDonalds as often after you watch ""Super Size Me.""  Some people will be convinced never to go back again, but I suspect most people will at least me compelled to think twice.  I rarely go out for fast food, not because I am health conscious, but because when I spend money on a fast food meal I keep thinking that I could have bought a really nice steak instead.  A stop at McDonalds is something we usually do when we are on the road and traveling great distances.  I remember when we came back from Europe having to stop at McDonalds to eat a Big Mac because that is what America tastes like, and with that deep thought I will leave you to mull over the attendant ironies.",5,This if Morgan Spurlock.

This was just an unfair attack against McDonalds. His agenda was to see if in fact by eating McDonalds for 30 days, if he would get health problems, gain weight, etc... Duh. But here's my problem with the guy. At the beginning of the film we obviously see that he is in tip top shape. The man has perfect blood pressure. He's at the right weight for his height. He works out regularly. He's just in perfect condition. During one of his first few meals, he ate his first supersize combo meal. I say his first because thats the impression he gives the viewer. He's completely in awe of the size of the French Fries container and the double quarter pounder. He proceeds to eat. 10 minutes later he feels ill. He's exhausted from eating the ""large"" meal and then we actually see him vomit! What a drama queen! Give me a break! Anyway, although other name brands of fast food, fatty foods and sodas are mentioned, the main target is McDonalds and I am so ticked at this guy acting as if people are forced to eat that food. One question he asks the viewers is why should french fries be the only option for a side order? I got an answer to that one. If you don't like what's served or how its prepared, eat somewhere else! What really irked me is when he brought kids into the equation and how McD's really targets them with their happy meals and playgrounds. He did actually take a step away from McDonalds and attack the schools for not giving children a better lunch menu, but like I said, most of the film is centered on Mickey D's. Hey I got an idea. How about we go after birthdays and blame whoever started the tradition of eating cakes and ice cream?By the end of the film, the man offered no solution. He leaves us with the impression that overweight Americans have no personal responsibility for their weight problems. Basically, we have this health nut along with some of his doctors telling people we shouldn't eat McDonalds. I don't know about anyone else, but I never ate McDonalds thinking I was eating healthy. Stop making the obesity problem a complicated issue. People are fat because they are lazy, they don't exercise enough, they make poor food choices and eat too much. It's common sense. What makes a person fat or why they continue to remain that way is an indivual problem that cannot simply be solved by holding a fast food company or any corporation responsible. It's called personal responsibility, people. Some choose to smoke. Some choose to drink. Some choose to over-eat and eat the fatty foods.

GUESS WHAT! it is not so. Today more than ever, much of society has given up their capacity to free choice to somebody else. Many people wants others to think for them because self responsibility has become too much of a frightening burden to endure. This way, if something goes wrong we can always blame somebody else. The food industry (among others) has done just that, mesmerizing us with -bigger is better- mentality and quantity over quality (including monetary cost) is all that is important. Many of us have imbraced this way of thinking because is easy to follow than lead (and that is the reason I mentioned above). Should be common sense that fast food is bad food and should be eaten in moderation (perhaps no more than twice a month), but who has the time, or will to cook at home today or do anything ourselves anymore? we are (as a whole) a lazy society and we are paying the price for it with our own lives. We must understamd that it is our own fault for the food industry unhealthy overall products, but we give them the power to do so by not making up our own minds about it and putting and end to this madness. Of course many, many sector of the industry today are adopting this quantity over quality mentality simply because that is what people wants, look at the car industry for example or the media mindless eye candied programming today.

While it is entertaining I did feel the conclusion was obvious. In my opinion, McDonald's is a fast-food restaurant like any other and no one who eats out everyday does it for health reasons. Spurlock seems to grind his axe at times and almost seems ""anti-corporation"" which rubbed me the wrong way. I get the impression he is trying to remove the individual's right to choose since every individual has a responsibility to themselves regarding healthy eating and living. Perhaps the documentary is directed towards young people who were never taught the basics of food education at home. He does make some good points while disgustingly showing the lack of decomposition of fast food. This is the educationally enhanced version which includes 61 minutes of new, instructional content and games that help educate viewers on a host of subjects related to the film. Honestly, if you haven't seen the documentary yet I would just get the original DVD (theatrical release) sold separately for less money because the enhanced content doesn't add much value to the viewer nor does it include the original supplements which are superior (4 deleted scenes, interviews and an audio commentary).

I used to feel that way before I saw ""Super Size Me"". But the movie actually super-sized my feelings about the world's biggest chain of bad food there is.As strongly as I feel about them, when the lawsuits against them came out I couldn't help but feel that they were a bit frivolous, by not acknowledging the level of responsibility that we all have as individuals for what we put into our bodies. But worse than the lawsuit was the way it was dismissed, which was beyond laughable, putting the burden of proof on the people who sued McD, by partly saying that they had failed to demonstrate that the food McDonald's served was unhealthy.... Just see the movie, and you will be able to decide for yourself if this makes sense or not.At the end of the day, the disappointing thing that becomes patently obvious after you see ""Super Size Me"" is that the consumer's health and best interests are not typically at the top of the agenda of the food industry as a whole, and social responsibility is a concept that seems to elude them when the interests of the shareholders and Wall Street expectations start to knock on the door.What do I think about ""Super Size Me""? It is a great documentary that puts the facts about this critical issue on the table, in a balanced way (actually attempting to incorporate McDonald's comments into the movie, without success).

I know I was expecting to love this film, if for no other reason than because I am a vegetarian. But my reaction to this film ended up being rather ho-hum.First of all, the premise of the film was gimmicky. I didn't know Spurlock's experiment consisted of eating nothing but McDonalds -- no vitamins, snacks at home, water at home, etc. That's stacking the deck. Also, my husband and I were baffled by the sheer amount of food he ate -- he ate enough for two or three people. That wasn't exactly the scientific method. And where in the world did he get the money? Who funded him? It seemed almost shady, in a way.Then, I saw the frat paddle on his wall. To me, being a frat boy and being a subversive, counter-cultural filmmaker -- well, they don't exactly go hand-in-hand, now do they?Some of his medical facts were wrong. He claimed that polycystic ovarian syndrome is CAUSED by being overweight. Uh .... no. POV CAUSES weight gain and CAUSES patients to become overweight. He had it backwards. Maybe because it is a women's health issue?I thought the graphic design in the movie was shoddy. Also, for heaven's sake, that awful, awful artwork his friend made ... ugh. Also, the original music for the movie was terrible, like bar band music. These elements gave this film the feel of an undergraduate student project. Not that there is anything wrong with that, in and of itself, but the way this movie was touted as being soooo IMPORTANT -- I expected a lot more!I felt at times that Spurlock was really into blaming overweight people for being overweight. I also felt he discriminated against handicapped people. I especially did not like the shot of the overweight person using the motorized store wheelchair, and Spurlock's comment that ""people in America don't like to walk."" Well, it's a little hard for a HANDICAPPED person to walk, dontcha know? It has nothing to do with laziness and eating at McDonalds. That shot was just plain rude. And, I know quite a few ""overweight"" people who eat healthy diets and work out. I even know some ""overweight"" vegans. Spurlock should have addressed the fallacy of the BMI chart and how healthy bodies can come in all shapes and sizes.The more I think about it, the more I think this movie was just a flash in the (hamburger) pan. I doubt we'll be hearing much from this filmmaker again. The topic of the film was worthy, but the execution left much to be desired. It sure wasn't worth all the hype it got.

I also don't see his point in his rule that he had to supersize everytime he was asked, and especially his rule that he had to eat everything he bought.  The way I see it, you eat until you're full, and then stop.  No one should force themselves to keep eating after they're full.  That's ridiculous!  No wonder he threw up out his car window!

770176,A319KYEIAZ3SON,B0000B1OC4,Mary Whipple,"[1, 1]","Concerned with the possible responsibility of the fast food industry for the doubling of the obesity rate in the US since 1980, videographer Morgan Spurlock explores the question of where personal responsibility for the problem stops and where corporate responsibility, specifically with McDonald's, begins. In outstanding physical condition when he begins his personal study, he determines to spend a month eating all three meals a day at McDonald's, eating everything on the menu at least once and ""supersizing"" only if the salesperson offers that option.In the course of the month, Spurlock gains twenty-five pounds, but even more importantly, he suffers serious liver problems and gains sixty-five points in cholesterol, while eating a pound a day of sugar and twelve pounds of fat in a month. Depressed, subject to headaches, and constantly tired, he becomes physically addicted to the food he is eating.With McDonald's playgrounds, birthday party promotions, Happy Meals, giveaway toys, clowns, and cartoons, Spurlock is also concerned about the long-term influence of McDonald's on young children and whether the corporation offers information about nutrition when it is contracted to provide elementary and middle school lunches. Though the film shows children everywhere ordering fries, many do not order anything with protein or vitamins for the entire meal, living on the fat from the fries and the sugar from the ketchup. Sadly, of the children interviewed, all could identify a photograph of Ronald McDonald, but only one could identify George Washington.Under constant supervision by a cardiologist, a gastroenterologist, and an internist, Spurlock manages to survive, but it takes him over a year to undo the damage he does to his health. The photography appeals to the sensational, with a regrettable close-up of the vomiting Spurlock on his first day on the diet and an even more sensational close-up of a gastric bypass, geared to be as repulsive as possible, as an alternative for the obese who are dealing with high blood pressure and diabetes. Filled with interesting, if fairly well publicized facts, and very entertaining, Spurlock's film offers a warning about the dangers of diets highly dependent upon fast food.

770177,A2R6RA8FRBS608,B0000B1OC4,Matthew G. Sherwin,"[9, 10]","In this film Morgan Spurlock makes his point very forcefully that fast food is indeed very harmful to a person's health. Yet people routinely eat fast food, sometimes more than once a day! People need some type of shock treatment to realize that fast food is dangerous to their health--and this film is one excellent tool people should use to educate others about the dangers of fast food. As the film points out, fast food companies have long tried (and succeeded) to hook kids from a very early age on junk food and fast food with high unhealthy levels of fat, cholesterol, and calories. (In one scene, when Morgan asks children if they can recognize George Washington, Jesus Christ, and Ronald McDonald, the only face they consistently recognize was McDonald!)As other reviewers write, in Super Size Me the director of the film, Morgan Spurlock, goes on a 30 day diet of nothing but McDonald's fast food. If McDonald's doesn't sell it, he doesn't eat it. The experiment is extreme but proves Spurlock's point well. We see Morgan become ill, throwing up his food after just three or four days of the experiment. Then he soon has much less energy and his cholesterol shoots up with his internal organs taking a pounding. I was upset to watch it yet I admired his determination to make an important point. Morgan has arguments with his vegetarian girlfriend; she doesn't like his mood swings and she openly admits the quality of their sex life has deteriorated. The doctors start telling Morgan he might even have to go to an emergency room for any ill effects of the diet--after only three weeks! It's an important look at the debilitating effects of a fast food diet.The DVD comes with extensive extras that are wonderful. We see how a school in Illinois succeeds brilliantly in providing state of the art physical education for its students to help them avoid becoming overweight. We meet a couple who collects McDonald's memorabilia. The viewer also sees Morgan interview Eric Schlosser, the author of Fast Food Nation. Morgan also interviews a ""supermarket guru"" who shows how sugar breakfast cereals are on the supermarket shelf at a child's eyelevel to entice them and hook them onto sugar cereals. There are other deleted scenes and Spanish subtitles.There are, of course, some drawbacks to the film. McDonald's is almost exclusively singled out for criticism--hardly any mention is made of Burger King's menu, for example. I also would have liked to see how Morgan's mood swings affected his performance and relationships at work. And, although Spurlock does make the point that personal responsibility is a very important factor, the film doesn't go into this enough, at least in my opinion. Spurlock makes up for this, though, in a DVD extra about O.E., Overeaters Anonymous. I wish he had expanded on O.E. more.All in all, I believe that because of the obesity epidemic this film is highly important. Why not show it to children in the schools as soon as they can comprehend it? (Of course, that will be a tough one, since school lunch programs are very tight with the fast food lunch companies.) I heartily recommend this film for anyone since it illustrates such an important point about our health. I recently heard over the radio that our generation might actually have a shorter life span than our parents' because of our lack of attention to our own health care; this film is one wake-up call people should pay attention to.

Probably not, just the drinks I like!I was quite surprised at watching this movie, I expected Morgan to be sick a lot more than he was - we were only shown him vomiting once, after eating his first Super Size meal. But the change in him throughout was astonishing. I noticed the weight gain around his face, before anything else - he's quite tall anyway, so the weight wouldn't show that much. If he was shorter, it so would have!I was actually bored during this movie. I would have preferred to see more of Morgan (although not his girlfriend, what a self-absorbed, manipulative little madam she was!), rather than all the rubbish thrown in almost constantly, and lots of people who like the sounds of their own voices rather too much. I liked the way his girlfriend had a small moan about the lack of bedroom action she was getting - is it any wonder? It's also amazing how at the start, the doctors say what's going to happen to his body, rather smugly might I add, but by the end, they're proved completely wrong, and telling him to come off the ""diet"". I felt really sorry for Morgan at this point, he was worried, his girlfriend was worried (although already thinking about his detox diet, and forcing her views on him), and his mum was worried.The segment showing the kids eating their school lunches, was shocking. I'll admit now, in my early years of school, I always brought a packed lunch (still do when I'm working, as I can't afford anything else), in my later years of school, I barely ever ate lunch, and now I do. But I look at the amount of kids these days near a Burger King or a supermarket, who will quite happily walk up there during their lunch breaks, and buying a lot of garbage, and then stuff their faces.When the film finishes, there's a little run down of what happened to all the people. What I found really shocking, was that Morgan put on nearly 2 stone in the 30 days he was on the McDonalds diet, the majority of it going on in the first two weeks. It took him five MONTHS to lose 20lbs, and an additional nine MONTHS to lose the final 5lbs. He ate enough McDonalds as nutritionists recommend being eaten in 8 years. But how many people (anybody here, I'm not going to stick to Americans, or any of that rubbish) regularly go to these places? When you're a parent & you have bratty, whiny little kids, then it'll be on a regular basis. And they'll pass it onto their kids, who'll pass it onto their kids. It's a growing epidemic. It's easy & it's quick. But the majority of the time, it doesn't taste that terrific, no matter what time of day you go.I still don't agree with the two American girls suing McDonalds because it made them fat. Whatever, girls, you stick to your crisps, and your TV, and god knows what else. I reckon if Morgan had exercised at the same time, sure there would have still been weight gain, but not as much, and it wouldn't have taken as long to lose.I wouldn't necessarily watch this again, but it's left a lasting impression on me. I don't want to watch the extras, where we get an inside look at the food decomposing. No thank you, cos I'll never eat again if I watch that. Now just gimme my medium Coke, and I'll be out of here.",3,When was the last time you had a McDonalds?,1114819200,"04 30, 2005",2005,3294,"['have', ""n't"", 'had', 'McDonalds', 'six', 'months', 'even', 'then', 'was', 'only', 'get', 'drink', 'Will', 'ever', 'again', 'Probably', 'not', 'just', 'drinks', 'like', 'was', 'quite', 'surprised', 'watching', 'movie', 'expected', 'Morgan', 'be', 'sick', 'lot', 'more', 'was', 'were', 'only', 'shown', 'vomiting', 'once', 'eating', 'first', 'Super', 'Size', 'meal', 'change', 'was', 'astonishing', 'noticed', 'weight', 'gain', 'face', 'anything', 'else', 'quite', 'tall', 'anyway', 'weight', 'would', ""n't"", 'show', 'that', 'much', 'was', 'shorter', 'so', 'would', 'have', 'was', 'actually', 'bored', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'preferred', 'see', 'more', 'Morgan', 'not', 'girlfriend', 'what', 'self-absorbed', 'manipulative', 'little', 'madam', 'was', 'rather', 'rubbish', 'thrown', 'almost', 'constantly', 'lots', 'people', 'who', 'sounds', 'own', 'voices', 'rather', 'too', 'much', 'liked', 'way', 'girlfriend', 'had', 'small', 'moan', 'lack', 'bedroom', 'action', 'was', 'getting', 'wonder', 'also', 'amazing', 'how', 'start', 'doctors', 'say', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'body', 'rather', 'smugly', 'might', 'add', 'end', ""'re"", 'proved', 'completely', 'wrong', 'telling', 'come', 'off', 'diet', 'felt', 'really', 'sorry', 'Morgan', 'point', 'was', 'worried', 'girlfriend', 'was', 'worried', 'already', 'thinking', 'detox', 'diet', 'forcing', 'views', 'mum', 'was', 'worried.The', 'segment', 'showing', 'kids', 'eating', 'school', 'lunches', 'was', 'shocking', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'now', 'early', 'years', 'school', 'always', 'brought', 'packed', 'lunch', 'still', 'do', 'when', ""'m"", 'working', 'ca', ""n't"", 'afford', 'anything', 'else', 'later', 'years', 'school', 'barely', 'ever', 'ate', 'lunch', 'now', 'do', 'look', 'amount', 'kids', 'days', 'Burger', 'King', 'supermarket', 'who', 'will', 'quite', 'happily', 'walk', 'there', 'lunch', 'breaks', 'buying', 'lot', 'garbage', 'then', 'stuff', 'faces.When', 'film', 'finishes', 'little', 'run', 'down', 'what', 'happened', 'people', 'What', 'found', 'really', 'shocking', 'was', 'Morgan', 'put', 'nearly', '2', 'stone', '30', 'days', 'was', 'McDonalds', 'diet', 'majority', 'going', 'first', 'two', 'weeks', 'took', 'five', 'MONTHS', 'lose', '20lbs', 'additional', 'nine', 'MONTHS', 'lose', 'final', '5lbs', 'ate', 'enough', 'McDonalds', 'nutritionists', 'recommend', 'being', 'eaten', '8', 'years', 'how', 'many', 'people', 'anybody', 'here', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'stick', 'Americans', 'rubbish', 'regularly', 'go', 'places', 'When', ""'re"", 'parent', 'have', 'bratty', 'whiny', 'little', 'kids', 'then', ""'ll"", 'be', 'regular', 'basis', ""'ll"", 'pass', 'kids', 'who', ""'ll"", 'pass', 'kids', 'growing', 'epidemic', 'easy', 'quick', 'majority', 'time', ""n't"", 'taste', 'terrific', 'matter', 'what', 'time', 'day', 'go.I', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'agree', 'two', 'American', 'girls', 'suing', 'McDonalds', 'made', 'fat', 'Whatever', 'girls', 'stick', 'crisps', 'TV', 'god', 'what', 'else', 'reckon', 'Morgan', 'had', 'exercised', 'same', 'time', 'sure', 'there', 'would', 'have', 'still', 'been', 'weight', 'gain', 'not', 'as', 'much', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'taken', 'as', 'long', 'lose.I', 'would', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'watch', 'again', 'left', 'lasting', 'impression', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'watch', 'extras', 'where', 'get', 'inside', 'look', 'food', 'decomposing', 'thank', 'cos', ""'ll"", 'never', 'eat', 'again', 'watch', 'Now', 'just', 'gim', 'medium', 'Coke', ""'ll"", 'be', 'here']",N/A

770181,A3KEZLJ59C1JVH,B0000B1OC4,Melissa Niksic,"[4, 5]","This is a great documentary by independent filmmaker Morgan Spurlock that takes a look at the dark side of the fast food industry. Spurlock, a 30-something-year-old guy in EXCELLENT health, decides to conduct an experiment and see what will happen if he goes on an all-McDonald's diet for 30 days. The rules are simple: he has to eat three square meals a day, and EVERYTHING he puts into his body has to come from McDonald's...he won't even have water unless it's bottled water that's sold at McDonald's.Obviously, we know that this McDiet is going to have bad effects on Spurlock's body and his overall physical health. However, I was absolutely STUNNED at how severely all that crappy food messed him up, and how quickly it happened! This guy gained 10 pounds after only ONE WEEK on the McDiet, and by the end of the experiment he's in such bad shape that the doctors are comparing his liver damage to that of a severe alcoholic.The one criticism I have about this movie is that even though Spurlock enlists in the help of numerous doctors and dietitians to monitor his progress, this can't be considered a very scientific experiment. People's bodies adjust to things differently, and it's also hard to prove that all of the symptoms Spurlock experienced (depression, fatigue) were a result of his terrible diet (it's very likely that they WERE, but I'm just saying it's impossible for him to prove). Still, because this guy was in such great shape to begin with, we get to see how a McDiet will weaken a perfectly healthy human being, and as I said before, it's really scary to see what happens to him.In addition to the McDiet, Spurlock also sheds light on other aspects of the fast food industry. He details how a Chicken McNugget is made and reveals how much chicken it actually contains (not much). School cafeterias are also scrutinized as Spurlock investigates what types of food are being served to students in their school lunchrooms...his discoveries are quite frightening.Throughout the course of the film, Spurlock makes about 200,000 calls to the McDonald's corporation asking for an interview. He never gets one. How shocking.I haven't eaten at McDonald's in years, so ""Super Size Me"" only succeeded in reaffirming my belief that any food from that ""restaurant"" is basically a heart attack on a plate.

The outstanding fact is that he decided at the outset to accept the ""supersize"" option if offered AND eat all the food for each meal at that sitting. This  may seem overdoing it, but some people actually do this. It is a smart and fast moving journey through 30 days.

770185,A18RQ2URRGIIEA,B0000B1OC4,"M. Hart ""Sci-Fi Fan""","[5, 8]","The 2004 documentary ""Super Size Me"" is an accurate and frightening look at what so many Americans regularly eat: fast food.  Filled with high carbohydrates and high fat, it's really no wonder why such a large percentage of the American population, including children, is overweight.  The film's director and creator, Morgan Spurlock, decided to document an experiment upon himself: under doctor's supervision, Mr. Spurlock ate nothing but the products of the fast food giant McDonald's for one full month (30 days).  He did not supplement his pure McDonald's diet with anything else, including exercise.  At the end of 30 days, he had gained over 20 pounds and blood tests demonstrated that he had done a considerable amount of damage to various internal organs in his body.  He even experienced heart problems.  Interlaced with Mr. Spurlock's dangerous experiment, he documented what this nation's children typically eat in public schools: soda pop, French fries, candy and other assorted high-carbohydrate/high-fat foods.  Further, due to the pressure on public schools to increase students' test scores, many public schools have forgone mandatory physical education.  The result: overweight children addicted to high doses of sugar and fat.Though Mr. Spurlock endangered his own health and life to carry out his bizarre McDonald's-only diet for 30 days, the documentary no doubt succeeded in forcing McDonald's to make at least one major change at its various fast food outlets: no more ""super size"" portions.  Further, many public schools across the nation have begun to remove soda pop machines from schools in an effort to encourage children to drink milk, water and other far more healthier drinks.  Yesterday, in what was probably a public relations ploy, the American Beverage Association announced that it was voluntarily asking its members (that include all major soft drink manufacturers) to remove soda pop machines from elementary schools.  This is no doubt in reaction to the now 12 states that have enacted laws banning soda pop sales to students during school hours.I highly thank Mr. Spurlock for demonstrating in his documentary ""Super Size Me"" the very real dangers of eating nothing but high-carbohydrate and high-fat foods.  Hopefully many more people will become more conscience of what they and their children eat.  Obesity is not healthy, and as the documentary ""Super Size Me"" clearly shows, it's downright dangerous.  Hence, I rate Mr. Spurlock's documentary ""Super Size Me"" with a resounding 5 out of 5 stars and highly recommend it to everyone.  It's no wonder that Mr. Spurlock won the prestigious Director's Award from the Sundance Film Festival in 2004.  The film also received an Oscar nomination for Best Documentary from the 2005 Academy Awards.",5,The Frightening Realities of What Too Many Americans Eat,1124323200,"08 18, 2005",2005,2781,"['2004', 'documentary', 'Super', 'Size', 'Me', 'accurate', 'frightening', 'look', 'what', 'so', 'many', 'Americans', 'regularly', 'eat', 'fast', 'food', 'Filled', 'high', 'carbohydrates', 'high', 'fat', 'really', 'wonder', 'why', 'large', 'percentage', 'American', 'population', 'including', 'children', 'overweight', 'film', 'director', 'creator', 'Morgan', 'Spurlock', 'decided', 'document', 'experiment', 'upon', 'doctor', 'supervision', 'Mr.', 'Spurlock', 'ate', 'nothing', 'products', 'fast', 'food', 'giant', 'McDonald', 'one', 'full', 'month', '30', 'days', 'did', 'not', 'supplement', 'pure', 'McDonald', 'diet', 'anything', 'else', 'including', 'exercise', 'end', '30', 'days', 'had', 'gained', '20', 'pounds', 'blood', 'tests', 'demonstrated', 'had', 'done', 'considerable', 'amount', 'damage', 'various', 'internal', 'organs', 'body', 'even', 'experienced', 'heart', 'problems', 'Interlaced', 'Mr.', 'Spurlock', 'dangerous', 'experiment', 'documented', 'what', 'nation', 'children', 'typically', 'eat', 'public', 'schools', 'soda', 'pop', 'French', 'fries', 'candy', 'other', 'assorted', 'high-carbohydrate/high-fat', 'foods', 'Further', 'due', 'pressure', 'public', 'schools', 'increase', 'students', 'test', 'scores', 'many', 'public', 'schools', 'have', 'forgone', 'mandatory', 'physical', 'education', 'result', 'overweight', 'children', 'addicted', 'high', 'doses', 'sugar', 'Mr.', 'Spurlock', 'endangered', 'own', 'health', 'life', 'carry', 'out', 'bizarre', ""McDonald's-only"", 'diet', '30', 'days', 'documentary', 'doubt', 'succeeded', 'forcing', 'McDonald', 'make', 'least', 'one', 'major', 'change', 'various', 'fast', 'food', 'outlets', 'more', 'super', 'size', 'portions', 'Further', 'many', 'public', 'schools', 'nation', 'have', 'begun', 'remove', 'soda', 'pop', 'machines', 'schools', 'effort', 'encourage', 'children', 'drink', 'milk', 'water', 'other', 'far', 'more', 'healthier', 'drinks', 'Yesterday', 'what', 'was', 'probably', 'public', 'relations', 'ploy', 'American', 'Beverage', 'Association', 'announced', 'was', 'voluntarily', 'asking', 'members', 'include', 'major', 'soft', 'drink', 'manufacturers', 'remove', 'soda', 'pop', 'machines', 'elementary', 'schools', 'doubt', 'reaction', 'now', '12', 'states', 'have', 'enacted', 'laws', 'banning', 'soda', 'pop', 'sales', 'students', 'school', 'hours.I', 'highly', 'thank', 'Mr.', 'Spurlock', 'demonstrating', 'documentary', 'Super', 'Size', 'Me', 'very', 'real', 'dangers', 'eating', 'nothing', 'high-carbohydrate', 'high-fat', 'foods', 'Hopefully', 'many', 'more', 'people', 'will', 'become', 'more', 'conscience', 'what', 'children', 'eat', 'Obesity', 'not', 'healthy', 'documentary', 'Super', 'Size', 'Me', 'clearly', 'downright', 'dangerous', 'Hence', 'rate', 'Mr.', 'Spurlock', 'documentary', 'Super', 'Size', 'Me', 'resounding', '5', '5', 'stars', 'highly', 'recommend', 'everyone', 'wonder', 'Mr.', 'Spurlock', 'won', 'prestigious', 'Director', 'Award', 'Sundance', 'Film', 'Festival', '2004', 'film', 'also', 'received', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'Best', 'Documentary', '2005', 'Academy', 'Awards']",N/A

The lead in this film spends 30 days eating nothing but McDonald's food, three meals a day.  The result is quite fascinating from a medical and health standpoint.What is most interesting are the various segments about the food industry, product sales and advertising, obesity and the health risks associated with a poor diet.  I felt actually quite ill while watching and wanted to run out and get some organic vegetables and fruits.  The segments on how school lunch programs are so poor in health benefits, while the exercise programs have been limited, were quite illuminating and disturbing.  Note to self; check out the school lunch program before sending the kids to school.The segments on addiction from various chemicals in processed food were a bit of a stretch, but the point was that these lifestyle choices may have at their source some elements of addiction within the foods themselves.One point that was pretty obvious was that he ate only the worst of McDonald's food.  The choices of ""super-size"" fries and Cokes, Big Macs, and the like were the only foods he ate, every meal.  I wonder what the difference would have been if he ate only salads without dressing, bottled water, and apples?  Likely the results would be quite different.  Even so, the serious medical impact of his diet for a month, to say nothing of the weight gain of nearly 10% of his body weight in a couple weeks, was powerful enough to demonstrate that many Americans face serious health consequences due to their diet.One warning on this film is that is does contain some sections that are quite disgusting.  Gastric bypass operations, vomiting, hairs in foods, etc., will cure anyone from eating this food for awhile.Overall, a very interesting documentary.  Sure it is overly dramatic, and too unrealistic to be considered ""truthful"", but nonetheless quite impactful.  The DVD and film itself is quite well done, and the production and editing are great throughout.  The one area that the film needed to be stronger in and more balanced with, are the personal responsibility we have to take care of our health and diet.

What could have been a film about the potential risks of eating too much fast-food ended up being a bash-o-rama on the fast food industry.The data Spurlock used to back up his claims about obesity and it being an ""epidemic"" was questionable since it came from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) who is known to have published studies with questionable statistics on subjects like guns and AIDS.I would point out it was recently reported that a North Carolina woman named Merab Morgan lost 37 pounds eating only McDonalds food over a three month period. Morgan got the idea for her diet after viewing this film and used the nutrition information supplied by McDonalds to achieve her weight loss.Not surprisingly, Spurlock is silent about examples of people like Morgan who have lost weight as a result of a McDonalds only diet even though his film features someone who lost lots of weight eating only Subway meals.Merab Morgan's example brings up a good point in that people are responsible for what they eat, not restaurants. And the problem with a McDonalds-only diet isn't what is on the menu, but the choices made from it.This film goes to show how objectivity goes out the window when someone has an agenda.",1,McNastiness Indeed!,1124064000,"08 15, 2005",2005,1415,"['thought', 'overall', 'Morgan', 'Spurlock', 'film', 'unfairly', 'targeted', 'McDonalds', 'other', 'fast', 'food', 'restaurant', 'chains', 'uncaring', 'corporate', 'giants', 'purely', 'seeking', 'profits', 'expense', 'customers', 'What', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'film', 'potential', 'risks', 'eating', 'too', 'much', 'fast-food', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'bash-o-rama', 'fast', 'food', 'industry.The', 'data', 'Spurlock', 'used', 'back', 'up', 'claims', 'obesity', 'being', 'epidemic', 'was', 'questionable', 'came', 'Centers', 'Disease', 'Control', 'CDC', 'who', 'known', 'have', 'published', 'studies', 'questionable', 'statistics', 'subjects', 'guns', 'AIDS.I', 'would', 'point', 'out', 'was', 'recently', 'reported', 'North', 'Carolina', 'woman', 'named', 'Merab', 'Morgan', 'lost', '37', 'pounds', 'eating', 'only', 'McDonalds', 'food', 'three', 'month', 'period', 'Morgan', 'got', 'idea', 'diet', 'viewing', 'film', 'used', 'nutrition', 'information', 'supplied', 'McDonalds', 'achieve', 'weight', 'loss.Not', 'surprisingly', 'Spurlock', 'silent', 'examples', 'people', 'Morgan', 'who', 'have', 'lost', 'weight', 'result', 'McDonalds', 'only', 'diet', 'even', 'film', 'features', 'someone', 'who', 'lost', 'lots', 'weight', 'eating', 'only', 'Subway', 'meals.Merab', 'Morgan', 'example', 'up', 'good', 'point', 'people', 'are', 'responsible', 'what', 'eat', 'not', 'restaurants', 'problem', 'McDonalds-only', 'diet', ""n't"", 'what', 'menu', 'choices', 'made', 'it.This', 'film', 'show', 'how', 'objectivity', 'out', 'window', 'when', 'someone', 'agenda']",N/A

While his vegan girlfriend prayed for him, doctors charted his speedy decline into a coronary or liver failure patient just waiting to happen.Given the short period of study, he also put on a massive amount of weight; it took him a comparatively long time to take it off again. I'd say he suffered for his cause. Spurlock renders it oh-so easy and entertaining for us to watch his exploits, but he certainly made his point. Who, if anyone, can come away from this DVD with a complacent attitude?Some folks like to say that films of this nature are not true documentaries because they're not objective. But do they work?When setting out to push people's hot buttons, objective dry facts and a conservative show host will likely not bring in the crowds. And since millions of people live a fast food lifestyle, a filmmaker attempting to alert people to the dangers of getting hooked needs to use shock tactics. Morgan Spurlock does that incredibly well.Let's face it. Documentarians tackling social and political hoodwinks are fighting the apathy and sheep-like behavior produced by hypnotic commercials, psychologically targeted colors and slogans, and food laced with sugar for maximum addictive effect (all of which helps render us more pliable to losses of personal freedom across the board). So if a guy has to eat 40 pounds of sugar disguised as McDonald's buns and throw up in the parking lot to get our attention, more power to him!P.S.

In a nation where 60% of adults are overweight or obese, and each day one of every four Americans eats fast food, director Morgan Spurlock wanted to test the correlation....by eating nothing but McDonald's food for 30 days. He enlisted the help of a cardiologist, a gastroenterologist, an internist, and a dietitian to monitor his heath. He ate 3 McDonald's meals a day, tried everything on the menu at least once, and  ""supersized"" if he was asked. Spurlock also limited himself to walking 5,000 steps per day, which is average in the US, although virtually unheard of in his native Manhattan (where you will find 83 McDonald's restaurants). ""Super Size Me"" follows Spurlock over the course of a month, from his first Egg McMuffin to his last McMeal, from fit to fat, as his health deteriorates alarmingly.Spurlock has an irreverent, winning personality that keeps the audience entertained. He has included interviews with John Banzahf and Samuel Hirsch, the lawyers who represented the two women suing McDonald's, a former Surgeon General, doctors, nutritionists, health advocate and would-be heir to the Baskin-Robbins fortune John Robbins, and Spurlock's vegan girlfriend Alex Jamieson, who watches in horror as her man is transformed by fast food. Spurlock also takes a look at school lunch programs that feature fast food and one that doesn't: a high school for problem students in Appleton, Wisconsin that serves only unprocessed foods that look pretty edible.It's no surprise that McDonald's doesn't fare well in this film. McDonald's is fast food's worse case scenario. But they own 43% of the US fast food market and serve 46 million customers a day worldwide, so they're the logical target. Of course, anyone can choose not to patronize McDonald's. But Spurlock's point is that consumers cannot make good decisions if they don't have accurate information. McDonald's claims that it is common knowledge that any processing their food undergoes serves to make it less healthy. Is it? While most Americans surely realize that fast food is unhealthy, it is much worse for people than they would reasonably expect. Eating sugary, fatty foods at McDonald's isn't comparable to preparing them in your own kitchen by any stretch of the imagination. The stuff that McDonald's sells is highly toxic. What passes for food is simply amazing. And ""Super Size Me"" is a very funny, occasionally frightening, insightful look at the consequences of fast food culture.The DVD: Bonus features include 4 deleted scenes, 6 interviews, one featurette, and an audio commentary by Morgan Spurlock and girlfriend Alex Jamieson. The ""Extra Interviews"" are: Phil Lambert, supermarket guru, talks about product placements in grocery stores (4 minutes). Phil Lauler of ""P.E. For Life"" talks about physical education in the schools. Don Gorske, Big Mac Expert and fanatic talks about the Big Macs in his life (3 minutes). Artists from The McDonald's Project demonstrate their use of recognizable products, some from McDonald's, to make socio-political statements (3 1/2 minutes) -some of these are clever. Owner of Brooklyn restaurant ChipShop ([...] famous for frying readymade pastries and candies, talks about the food (3 minutes). And a  25-minute interview with Eric Schlossen, author of ""Fast Food Nation"", in which he discusses how and why processed food differs from its unprocessed counterparts. ""The Smoking Fry"" is a funny and freaky featurette in which Morgan Spurlock places both McDonald's and less processed burgers and fries in jars to see how they degrade over time (5 minutes) -definitely worth watching.

But no one is really talking about filmmaker Morgan Spurlock's new documentary Super Size Me all that much. Obesity has become the second largest preventable death in the United States after smoking and Super Size Me really puts that into perspective. The concept of this movie is great. Morgan puts McDonald's food to the test by pledging to eat three square meals a day for 30 days of nothing but McDonalds. Throughout the film he keeps track of the effects it has on him. His sex drive becomes almost non-existant, his body fat goes up by 7%, he puts on 20 pds, his cholestorol raises by a whopping 65 points, etc.. Throughout the film Morgan uses his experiences to demonstrate just how damaging McDonalds and fastfood in general can be to those who eat it on a regular basis.Super Size Me was a great movie overall. Not only does the film chronicle Morgan and the effects the food has on him, but the effects that fastfood has on Americans and obesity in general. Even though Super Size Me is meant to be a serious film for the most part, it was also extremely funny and entertaining in some parts as well. Morgan becomes addicted to McDonalds after the first two weeks and has mood swings where he only feels good after he eats. I especially enjoyed the segment where Morgan's girlfriend complained about the affect his new diet had on their sex life. Not to mention the fact that Morgan forced himself to super size his meal everytime he was asked - hence the title.The special features on the DVD includes a shocking test called the ""Smoking Fry"" in which McDonalds fries are put into a mason jar and sealed to represent what they would look like breaking down in your stomach.

The documentary effectively demonstrates that America has once again become dysfunctional in its habits, specifically the way we unquestionably consume huge portions of fat- and sugar-laden foods.  I think the unhealthy effects of eating at McDonalds are obvious and predictable however. What really makes this film worth seeing is Spurlock's look into public school cafeterias and the slop that is fed the students who are inculcated and conditioned into horrific eating habits that will impact them for the rest of their lives. Also disturbing, the huge contracts the public schools make with the food companies who could care less about our health as they inundate us with calorie-dense foods that are packaged in ways to tempt children. In fact, Super Size Me is at its best when it confronts the ways children are brainwashed into obesity.

Both McDonald's and Burger King have given statements to authorities about this action and had flat-out refused to respond to Morgan's auction.McDonald's outside security cameras caught evidence of Morgan preparing himself to vomit by putting his finger down his throat before the infamous puke shot.Morgan's vomit also was found to have remains of a Snickers bar and huge amounts of vegetables.  Apparently Morgan was eating meals prepared by his vegetarian girlfriend and also enjoyed some other junk food snacks during the time he was supposedly only eating at McDs.One of the doctors in the film has not practiced medicine for 4 years and is associated with PETA - the anti-animal cruelty group.The other doctor has a practice which sees patients at most 3 days a week.  This doctor spends the rest of his weeks testifying in medical court cases.  He has received many questionable payments from lawyers and appears to be a professional medical testifier.

770200,A228JH8V9Y700G,B0000B1OC4,MortensOrchid,"[9, 12]","I always liked fast food ever since I was a kid, but this movie (along with the book Fast Food Nation that came out a few years before) taught me to hate it.Morgan Spurlock was an extreme example of what can happen if and when you eat fast food.  He was a healthy, active man who ate vegan (thanks to his girlfriend being a vegan chef) and lived in New York where most people walk miles rather than spend on transportation.  Until recently it was hard for me to believe that there are lots of ""heavy users"" out there, people who eat fast food everyday.  It was even harder for me to believe that people ate it for every single meal.  When you start working full time, though, you WILL believe.  It is a testiment to an unwillingness to choose wisely, lack of discipline, and for instant gratification.  Our waistlines are expanding like never before, and we are having to fight fat practically from the craddle.  Who is responsible?  WE ARE.If the ad says BUY THIS, will you buy it?  You don't have to if you don't want to.  It's the old addage: If everyone jumped off a bridge, would you do it too?  Hopefully the answer is no, but we aren't saying no to this.The experts made some very valid points in terms of marketing measures that McDonalds (and other fast food companies) have taken that are causing these problems:  Portions are out of control huge, there is a McDonalds restaurant around every corner, prices are cheap, etc.  We're supposed to love McDonalds.  We are conditioned to eat there from childhood on.  But it's two steps away from eating dogfood out of a can and they fill it with flavorings to make it taste so good.  We turn a blind eye to so many things just because it tastes good.One thing that really amazed me was when Spurlock was under a psychiatrist's care, as I experienced something similar.  He said he felt very depressed during this experiment for no reason, and they only time he felt happy again was when he was eating this food.  I immediately stopped eating fast food after that, as I suddenly understood what he was talking about.  And I'm not depressed or tired anymore for no reason.

770202,A2FYGNE9BL6TSR,B0000B1OC4,Mr Jazz De Cou,"[0, 0]","Super Size Me has received some good reviews, but the film has not yet been generally recognized as the masterpiece that it most certainly is.  This is one of few  films with  a clear concept executed with perfection.  Didactic objectives and esthetic values  have not  been  diluted a committee whose final product is a compromise of conflicting views and objectives.  Anyone who has seen the film should have recognized  that making money could  not have been  a primary objective of the producer, otherwise  he would not have been so unsparing in exposing the truth about  food producers, among the most poweful power blocs in the country.One of the striking virtues of this film is how American brand humor has been used so skillfully  to illuminate such an unhumorous subject as a national health endemic!  Even while laughing,  the viewer can have no doubt ever that the script is deadly serious about a life-and-death subject.  Could there ever be a better example than this film of how a heavy subject can be treated effectively in a light-handed, even comic manner?  Of course laughter is in fact a serious matter, as Arthur Kostler has amply noted with only a few words:  ""Dictators are more afraid  of laughter than they are of bombs.""But humor is hard to use except in strict  comedy or farce.  Morgan Spurlock obviously understands this and uses humor abundantly  but  with proper restraint and good judgment.  He does not take unfair advantage of those whom he criticizes.  He is criticizing  what people do, not who they are.  He may have made people mad, but some of those people may in the fullness of time if not before, recognize that his criticisms of their actions are  for the common good, including their own.  After all, they are endangering their health if they consume their own products.How can we not admire a guy who offers himself as a human guinea pig to provide evidence of what the supersized junk food diet does to the human body? He had to have had extraordinary vocation for his project and deep concern for the welfare of his fellow human beings to endanger his health in such a way.  Millions of Americans are experiencing impaired health and are shortening their lives because of faulty diet.  The fact is that we are what we eat. But, alas, our schools are doing a very bad job  educating us how to eat right and government agencies are doing a very bad job of protecting us against junk food.  For example, take a look at a food package  and try  to decipher what the ingredients are  printed in tiny  pale yellow characters on a pale peach  background.""Super Size Me"" is not only a highly effective educational vehicle but also a far more entertaining film than most feature films.  Yes, Virginia, to answer your unasked question, an educational film  can be as entertaining as a feature film but also even more so. ""Super Size Me"" with its bright  lighting,  saturated  vibrant colors and its bouncy, witty musical background has offered  us not only a film that can influence us to improve our health but  a film that provides convinicing evidence that the documentary film genre could become in future a far more popular and influential medium of communication than it has been until now.  Of late documentaries have been doing a far more effective job of exposing certain truths than the other media. How exhilirating it is to have some good news to report in these glomy times in which we live.Morgan Spurlock recognized that there was a crying need for the message of his film and he deserves high praise for having delivered that message in such a riveting form.I did not fully appreciate this film until I watched a second time, the second  time critically. The first time I watched it, I was enjoying myself too much  to try to  analayze why the film is so great.

It's also not nearly as pernicious as Michael Moore's output (with which it is otherwise comparable): you don't get the sense in the same way that Spurlock is massaging facts, glossing over inaccuracies or artfully splicing quotes, and he also seems all round a much better guy.Those that complain that everyone already knew MacDonalds was bad for us are, of course, right - but they're also sort of missing the point that even though we know that, as a culture we still go there in droves. That in itself is a fascinating subject for a documentary. And how many of those naysayers went out for a burger after the film? I had an apple!While Spurlock doesn't come across as quite the left wing looney that Moore does, I still think the ""McFatso"" litigation, which apparently was the spur for his film - was an ill-judged cause on which to build the narrative: Spurlock has a very good point; the McFatso plaintiffs just didn't. Here, the naysayers are defintely right: if you go to MacDonalds and get fat you have absolutely no-one to blame for it but yourself. It is absolutely right that the case was thrown out. To his credit, Spurlock gives ample air time to this view in the vox-pop clips he includes.Ultimately, the message isn't ""MacDonalds, you're Evil"" (because it just isn't: it's satisfying demand and pleasing its shareholders, and would be more evil if it didn't) so much as ""America, you're stupid, if this is what you really want"". Litigation against vendors won't change the way America eats because the problem isn't the supply, it's the demand. I don't think marketing is entirely to blame, either: even if given a $2bn budget, I don't think celery and broccoli would ever catch on in quite the same way. All the marketing in the world won't *continually* sell what people don't want to buy.Where Supersize Me may have a genuine effect is in persuading a few people to go the greengrocers and back to their kitchen instead of a takeway joint for dinner. That sort of a change in attitude will change MacDonald's tack forever. There is anecdotal evidence that it's already happening.Problem is, of course, that the sort of people who go to see this movie are the sorts that would already do that.Now, where's that carrot juice...Olly Buxton",4,Hold the fries,1094860800,"09 11, 2004",2004,2341,"['Supersize', 'Me', 'highly', 'effective', 'propaganda', 'piece', 'slick', 'funny', 'pointed', 'also', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'pernicious', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'output', 'otherwise', 'comparable', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'sense', 'same', 'way', 'Spurlock', 'massaging', 'facts', 'glossing', 'over', 'inaccuracies', 'artfully', 'splicing', 'quotes', 'also', 'round', 'much', 'better', 'guy.Those', 'complain', 'everyone', 'already', 'knew', 'MacDonalds', 'was', 'bad', 'are', 'course', 'right', ""'re"", 'also', 'sort', 'missing', 'point', 'even', 'know', 'that', 'culture', 'still', 'go', 'there', 'droves', 'fascinating', 'subject', 'documentary', 'how', 'many', 'naysayers', 'went', 'out', 'burger', 'film', 'had', 'apple', 'Spurlock', ""n't"", 'come', 'quite', 'left', 'wing', 'looney', 'Moore', 'still', 'think', 'McFatso', 'litigation', 'apparently', 'was', 'spur', 'film', 'was', 'ill-judged', 'cause', 'build', 'narrative', 'Spurlock', 'very', 'good', 'point', 'McFatso', 'plaintiffs', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'Here', 'naysayers', 'are', 'defintely', 'right', 'go', 'MacDonalds', 'get', 'fat', 'have', 'absolutely', 'no-one', 'blame', 'absolutely', 'right', 'case', 'was', 'thrown', 'out', 'credit', 'Spurlock', 'ample', 'air', 'time', 'view', 'vox-pop', 'clips', 'includes.Ultimately', 'message', ""n't"", 'MacDonalds', ""'re"", 'Evil', 'just', ""n't"", 'satisfying', 'demand', 'pleasing', 'shareholders', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'evil', 'did', ""n't"", 'so', 'much', 'America', ""'re"", 'stupid', 'what', 'really', 'want', 'Litigation', 'vendors', 'wo', ""n't"", 'change', 'way', 'America', 'problem', ""n't"", 'supply', 'demand', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'marketing', 'entirely', 'blame', 'even', 'given', '2bn', 'budget', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'celery', 'broccoli', 'would', 'ever', 'catch', 'quite', 'same', 'way', 'marketing', 'world', 'wo', ""n't"", '*continually*', 'sell', 'what', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'buy.Where', 'Supersize', 'Me', 'may', 'have', 'genuine', 'effect', 'persuading', 'few', 'people', 'go', 'greengrocers', 'back', 'kitchen', 'instead', 'takeway', 'joint', 'dinner', 'sort', 'change', 'attitude', 'will', 'change', 'MacDonald', 'tack', 'forever', 'anecdotal', 'evidence', 'already', 'happening.Problem', 'course', 'sort', 'people', 'who', 'go', 'see', 'movie', 'are', 'sorts', 'would', 'already', 'do', 'that.Now', 'where', 'carrot', 'juice', 'Olly', 'Buxton']",N/A

It's only in America and poor countries that McDonald's is eaten on a regular basis and is an institution. Here in Europe, most Europeans aren't really big consumers of fast food chains. McDonald's and other big American chains are not ver visible. In fact, there are no Wendy's, Mister Donut or Dunkin Donuts here in Scotland (I'm not sure about some parts of uk but I'm sure there aren't)McDonald's is a fast food chain, whose main aim is to serve ""Fast""ly prepared meals for those who can't have a proper meal at a restaurant. I myself have a McDonald's regularly and I would continue to do so. If I'm in a hurry, or at the airport or just for when I'm in the mood for it.This documentary is totally POINTLESS!

He tried very hard to make the docu-easily understood totally insulting the judgment of the viewing public!

770215,A3TBM91S4SP0MS,B0000B1OC4,Paulo Andre,"[7, 10]","One statistic I would like to know is exactly how many people gave up on McDonalds and fast-food in general since Morgan Spurlock's ""Super Size Me"" came out. There's probably information about that all over the Internet but I guess I'm just too lazy to look it up. However, it doesn't take rocket science to figure it out. My bet is that it didn't impact the industry at all. Not on the McDonalds around here anyway, they always seem to be packed.And why? Simply put, I believe McDonalds and friends are not the only ones to blame about this problem. Hell, they don't even have the largest slice of the blame pie. It all boils down to the fact that no-one is forced to enter a McDonalds outlet, no matter how many ads you see on the street. Granted, the food is like a bio hazard (despite how good it may taste, that's part of the deception), but isn't it true that people pay to eat it?Morgan Spurlock doesn't tell us anything exactly new nor proves any real existential point. ""Super Size Me"" has an interesting twist and that's seeing the documentary author himself sacrificing his own health to prove his theory that eating at McDonalds can damage your body and mind. So what else is new? The experiment, shall we call it, turns out not to be the most important thing and Spurlock seems to know it. At its heart, the documentary wants to be an eye opener, and if you ask me, I was much more impressed by hundreds of children eating junk in school together than watching the guy putting weight or having his blood pressure skyrocket.Aside the experiment, I found that the documentary does a very good job of showing all the implicatons of this problem. A few pundits give their fundamented opinion on the matters and Spurlock even tried to get an interview with a McDonalds representative which (surprise!) never happened. It's not like we don't know what the person would say, anyway.That eating for thirty days straight at a McDonalds is unrealistic and may kill you, we already knew.

People aren't stupid; rather, we are being inundated from the day we're born with billions of dollars of very sophisticated marketing, marketing that involves psychologists who have studied the human mind and the manner in which we sometimes can be manipulated.  This is one of the many important points ""Super Size Me"" makes.  There is a relentless effort by the fast food industry to make itself omnipresent in our schools, our cities, and our consciousness.  Thankfully, because of growing awareness, there are efforts by school districts across the country to provide healthier alternatives, such as the organic food options highlighted when Spurlock visited the school for ""troubled teens"" whose behavior and grades improved along with their diets.""Super Size Me"" is more than an informative and entertaining film, it has become something of a social movement as concerned citizens across the country (and in other parts of the world) have been sharing this DVD to raise awareness of the psychological and economic warfare of this business.

Secondly, it was entertaining.However, some points must be made.  First of all, Spurlock did not merely ""eat nothing but McDonald's food for a month.""  He greatly reduced his activity level, and *binged* on McDonald's food.  This weakens his argument, to say the least:  His declining health could very easily have been caused by his reduced activity level alone.Also, this film is often touted as being revolutionary, iconoclastic, or counter-culture...but it really isn't.  Yes, Spurlock *does* challenge a huge corporation.  But he does so by jumping on still another mainstream bandwagon:  Specifically, he feeds into the current fat-hysteria trend, complete with quoting statistics which were questionable when the movie was made, and which have since been disproven entirely.

Super Size Me provides a visceral demonstration of these ill effects.Director Morgan Spurlock undertakes a challenge of supersize proportions. He will survive solely on McDonald's food for 1 month. Against the recommendation of his doctors, mother, and girlfriend, he lives the next 30 days eating McD's for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. If the cashier asks if he would like to, he will super size his meals.What follows is a medical marvel as his body condition degrades so severely that his doctors beg him to stop his experiment. He puts on almost 25 pounds, he suffers chest pains, and among other ailments his sex life drops to zero. The clear message is that fast food is bad stuff.In between his gorging and palpitating he presents statistics and other 'facts' to show how the fast food industry fights tooth and nail to get customers while they are young and also against government intrusion into their business. The industry is painted in a very bad light, not that you needed to be told that.So why the low score? The problem with this movie is evident almost from the start when Morgan throws up out his car window after downing a double quarter pounder with cheese meal, supersized. For the benefit of the viewer who would never have seen vomit before, Spurlock gets a nice long shot of the mess.Another instance is the stomach stapling procedure. He choreographs the surgery in all its bloody g(l)ory to the Blue Danube waltz. Nothing is spared to the imagination. The squeamish are encrouaged to stay away.I understand why he wants to do this. He needs to drive home the point that fast food is disgusting, but his heavy handed use of this type of grotesque imagery is a weakness rather than a benefit to the movie. The movie would have been just as powerful without this sort of thing.In all, the movie has some really good points to make, but he is simply not skilled enough to bring the whole picture into view in the way a more skillful propaganda-documentarist like Michael Moore is able. 3 stars.",3,Gratuitous coarseness mars an otherwise clever movie,1184457600,"07 15, 2007",2007,2217,"['problem', 'overweight', 'related', 'health', 'issues', 'very', 'important', 'topic', 'often', 'discussed', 'real', 'effects', 'society', 'love', 'affair', 'fast', 'food', 'hardly', 'ever', 'driven', 'home', 'Super', 'Size', 'Me', 'visceral', 'demonstration', 'ill', 'effects.Director', 'Morgan', 'Spurlock', 'challenge', 'supersize', 'proportions', 'will', 'survive', 'solely', 'McDonald', 'food', '1', 'month', 'recommendation', 'doctors', 'mother', 'girlfriend', 'next', '30', 'days', 'eating', 'McD', 'breakfast', 'lunch', 'dinner', 'cashier', 'would', 'like', 'will', 'super', 'size', 'meals.What', 'medical', 'marvel', 'body', 'condition', 'degrades', 'so', 'severely', 'doctors', 'beg', 'stop', 'experiment', 'almost', '25', 'pounds', 'chest', 'pains', 'other', 'ailments', 'sex', 'life', 'drops', 'zero', 'clear', 'message', 'fast', 'food', 'bad', 'stuff.In', 'gorging', 'palpitating', 'statistics', 'other', ""'facts"", 'show', 'how', 'fast', 'food', 'industry', 'fights', 'nail', 'get', 'customers', 'are', 'young', 'also', 'government', 'intrusion', 'business', 'industry', 'painted', 'very', 'bad', 'light', 'not', 'needed', 'be', 'told', 'that.So', 'why', 'low', 'score', 'problem', 'movie', 'evident', 'almost', 'start', 'when', 'Morgan', 'up', 'car', 'window', 'downing', 'double', 'quarter', 'pounder', 'cheese', 'meal', 'supersized', 'benefit', 'viewer', 'who', 'would', 'never', 'have', 'seen', 'vomit', 'Spurlock', 'nice', 'long', 'shot', 'mess.Another', 'instance', 'stomach', 'stapling', 'procedure', 'choreographs', 'surgery', 'bloody', 'g', 'l', 'ory', 'Blue', 'Danube', 'waltz', 'Nothing', 'spared', 'imagination', 'squeamish', 'are', 'encrouaged', 'stay', 'away.I', 'understand', 'why', 'do', 'drive', 'home', 'point', 'fast', 'food', 'disgusting', 'heavy', 'handed', 'use', 'type', 'grotesque', 'imagery', 'weakness', 'rather', 'benefit', 'movie', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'just', 'powerful', 'sort', 'thing.In', 'movie', 'really', 'good', 'points', 'make', 'simply', 'not', 'skilled', 'enough', 'bring', 'whole', 'picture', 'view', 'way', 'more', 'skillful', 'propaganda-documentarist', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'able', '3', 'stars']",N/A

It conducts a worthwhile experiment, if one with a dunderheadedly obvious conclusion, but conducts it in such an obnoxious manner than it's better to skip straight to the conclusion. One is surprised to see such a film done at all, but it is not done well.The central problem: Spurlock is unlikable, and he finds himself an limitlessly fascinating subject. Endlessly he hams for the camera, and he's all too happy to chronicle every smirk, chortle, twitch, and McJoke. *Especially* the McJokes - if a ""McCoronary"" or ""McComa"" is funny once, it's funny *every* time, darn it. I'd had it with him fifteen minutes in. The movie's like watching someone's home movies for ninety minutes - those of someone who constantly elbows you in the ribs, prodding ""c'mon, c'mon, ain't this GREAT?"", and insists on narrating every banality.""Super Size Me"" would not seem to need padding, yet it repeats itself endlessly. There's about ten minutes of doctors praising Spurlock for his perfect health, trim figure, basement-level cholesterol, and on and on, until we suspect the film has gone beyond notation into braggadocio. The supersize portions at McDonald's are astounding, yes, but the movie takes way too much time to note this for each item, particularly when loudly driven home by Spurlock's faux, stagey marvel.Spurlock has a frat-boy sensibility. Grotesque caricatures serve as interstitials. The camera will focus pseudo-casually on the pin-ups in Spurlock's apartment to sneak some breasts into the picture. He swears like a 12-year-old - just to demonstrate he can. When he pukes, we have box seats. He chats as happily about his genital problems as any nightmare customer in line at the pharmacy.The in-depth, context-lending coverage of the obesity health issue is just a series of talking heads; the sleaziest 12-minute ""Dateline"" spot has more depth. There is a horror to Spurlock eating himself to near-death; this is as vivid and grotesquely memorable an illustration of a statistical reality as ever committed to film or memory. Spurlock's commitment to his cause cannot be impugned. ""Super Size Me"", though, relies on an emotional appeal, and as such, it's a particularly tiring one - a 90-minute ""No, you fool! Don't go into the basement alone!"" horror-movie moment, the indie version of those fundamentalist haunted houses that feature mock-ups of abortions and the puncture-filled torments of the Karo-decked condemned - venture not here, children, lest ye share this gruesome fate!

Nobody is really meant to eat nothing but McDonald's 3 times a day, and we all know that.  What Spurlock did was provide an accelerated look into what diets heavy on fast food and other ""junk"" foods do to our bodies and to our lives.Though Spurlock chose to use McDonald's for his experiment, it's only because they were the biggest target.  Anyone who views this film and says that it is nothing more than an attack on McDonald's is watching it with an extremely myopic view. ""Supersize Me"" is about the fast food business and about the culture which supports it. It's about the difference between healthy eating and unhealthy eating. It's a warning, not just about obesity but also about the broader issues that come with a diet high in fatty, unhealthy food.In the film we see more than Spurlock gaining weight. We see him feeling more and more exhausted and irritable. He seems a pretty likable guy, but we can see his mood swings start about halfway through his experiment. We hear his girlfriend talking about his reduced sex drive, and his doctors talking about the massive damage he's doing to his body, including his liver. One of his doctor's compares it to the movie ""Leaving Las Vegas."" In that movie, the Nicholas Cage character pickles his liver by drinking massive amounts of alcohol. Spurlock's doctor warns him that he's doing the same thing to his liver, but with a high-fat, high-calorie diet rather than alcohol.The extras on the DVD are interesting as well, and actually add some extra dimension to the story. In ""The Smoking Fry"" we see which of McDonald's products seems to last forever. The extra interviews include an interesting interview with Eric Schlosser, author of ""Fast Food Nation,"" as well as an extended interview with a guy who eats almost nothing other than Big Macs and an interview with the owner of New York's ""Chip Shop"" (fried Twinkies, anyone?), and some other interesting pieces. The deleted scenes weren't necessary to the film overall, but definitely added something afterwards.Morgan Spurlock seems quite a character, but his sense of humor and his attitude about what he's doing is admirable. He's honest and very candid, but with a lighthearted tone for the most part, and this really helps the film along.""Supersize Me"" is not a perfect film, nor is it a perfect presentation of the issues at hand. It's quite one-sided and clear in its agenda. Despite this, I consider it to be a brave act of filmmaking. You only have to watch the film to see the lengths to which Spurlock pushed his body to make this film. By the end, I was actually concerned for his health and even for his life. Putting one's body and health at risk for the sake of making a movie like this is nothing short of courageous act.Before you dismiss Spurlock's movie out of hand, think about this for a moment... would you do what he did?

(This is not to say that Spurlock's conclusions are wrong about fast-food...I think they're probably accurate.

There is a great sense of...""I'm going to show you what makes me mad and we're going to poke fun and provoke.""

It's the interviews and traveling he does around the country that truly support his central themes of how unhealthy we are and how beholden to the ""Industrial Food Complex"" we are.  His indictment of school lunches is easy to accomplish (the programs are SO awful), but we share anew the horror of discovery.  Some of his ""experiments"" are certainly unscientific...but they can raise goosebumps anyway.  When he shows kids pictures of ""famous"" people, only one recognizes George Washington and NONE recognize Jesus...yet they all know Ronald McDonald!!!Spurlock is constantly turning the camera on himself, and he really is a funny guy.  I can see why he's getting his own TV show.  He laughs at himself, is unselfconscious and he never pretends to be something he isn't.  His vocabulary is down to earth.  We also get to meet his horrified Vegan girlfriend, and his befuddled doctors and dieticians.  They are shocked at how much he falls apart under his questionable diet...it's a bit disconcerting to see just how bad things go for Spurlock, particularly as reflected in the demeanor of his amiable physicians.Overall, I was very entertained, a properly illuminated by SUPER SIZE ME.  It moves quickly, has lots of laughs, and even entertained the picky 13 year old in our household.

770229,AUM3YMZ0YRJE0,B0000B1OC4,Robert J. Crawford,"[4, 6]","Ok, I greatly enjoyed this film, in all its misinformation and grotesquerie. Spurlock (only Dickens could have coined a better name for him) wanted to show that with dietary excess, comes personal horror and poor health. He did, by consuming approximately 5000 calories a day or more, with three super-sized meals a day at McDonald's. He also quit exercising.Well, anyone who ate that much would get sick and fat. I have returned to the US after 6 years in Europe, and I am SHOCKED by what a normal portion is in the US. Fast food is not designed to be eaten that much, and I bet not even McDonald's executives would want him to eat like that. So, in the end, this film and his expanding waistline and alarming health indicators are purposefully engineered. If you look at what he did in this way, it is disingenuous.It is sad that many less-educated Americans do as he did, albeit they do over a slightly longer period of time than one month of supersizing. He just did it more purely, and by conscious effort. That is what is valuable about this film: he demonstrates, with his own body, what some less educated people do as a matter of course over several years.Spurlock is similar to Michael Moore, if a lesser talent. By exaggeration and grotesque simplification, they make great propaganda. I identify somewhat with their agenda and respect the way that they stir the pot - otherwise, the fat would rise to the top - but their work is not the kind of investigative journalism that starts out without message already chosen. It is a kind of muckraking entertainment, edumuckraking if you will.That being said, the impact of this film is positive in balance, I believe. It gets people to think - at least in my case. It is a great spur to discussion, even if I disagree in the end. Spurlock is a bit like Seymour Hersh, but is more entertaining than the great investigative journalist, and he doesn't pretend to be all that objective.The impact of this film is visceral disgust, and it does it phenomenally well. But there is another side in the details, and I believe, in the sincerity of people who are concerned with these issues within McDonald's.  From experience (and I am not a McDonald's employee), I know that there are many McDonald's executives who care personally about what their company does, all within the limits of their business model; they are trying to change their company for the common good. I admit, I am impressed by many of them.  Their company may not be perfect, but it is beginning to listen to some of its critics.  Spurlock's film would be better if it had more balance.Recommended, but exercise your critical intelligence!",3,"really disgusting, by design",1110326400,"03 9, 2005",2005,2658,"['Ok', 'greatly', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'misinformation', 'grotesquerie', 'Spurlock', 'only', 'Dickens', 'could', 'have', 'coined', 'better', 'name', 'wanted', 'show', 'dietary', 'excess', 'personal', 'horror', 'poor', 'health', 'did', 'consuming', 'approximately', '5000', 'calories', 'day', 'more', 'three', 'super-sized', 'meals', 'day', 'McDonald', 'also', 'quit', 'exercising.Well', 'anyone', 'who', 'ate', 'much', 'would', 'get', 'sick', 'fat', 'have', 'returned', 'US', '6', 'years', 'Europe', 'am', 'SHOCKED', 'what', 'normal', 'portion', 'US', 'Fast', 'food', 'not', 'designed', 'be', 'eaten', 'much', 'bet', 'not', 'even', 'McDonald', 'executives', 'would', 'want', 'eat', 'So', 'end', 'film', 'expanding', 'waistline', 'alarming', 'health', 'indicators', 'are', 'purposefully', 'engineered', 'look', 'what', 'did', 'way', 'disingenuous.It', 'sad', 'many', 'less-educated', 'Americans', 'do', 'did', 'do', 'slightly', 'longer', 'period', 'time', 'one', 'month', 'supersizing', 'just', 'did', 'more', 'purely', 'conscious', 'effort', 'what', 'valuable', 'film', 'own', 'body', 'what', 'less', 'educated', 'people', 'do', 'matter', 'course', 'several', 'years.Spurlock', 'similar', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'lesser', 'talent', 'exaggeration', 'grotesque', 'simplification', 'make', 'great', 'propaganda', 'identify', 'somewhat', 'agenda', 'respect', 'way', 'stir', 'pot', 'otherwise', 'fat', 'would', 'rise', 'top', 'work', 'not', 'kind', 'investigative', 'journalism', 'out', 'message', 'already', 'chosen', 'kind', 'muckraking', 'entertainment', 'edumuckraking', 'will.That', 'being', 'said', 'impact', 'film', 'positive', 'balance', 'believe', 'people', 'think', 'least', 'case', 'great', 'spur', 'discussion', 'even', 'disagree', 'end', 'Spurlock', 'bit', 'Seymour', 'Hersh', 'more', 'entertaining', 'great', 'investigative', 'journalist', ""n't"", 'pretend', 'be', 'objective.The', 'impact', 'film', 'visceral', 'disgust', 'phenomenally', 'well', 'side', 'details', 'believe', 'sincerity', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'concerned', 'issues', 'McDonald', 'experience', 'am', 'not', 'McDonald', 'employee', 'know', 'are', 'many', 'McDonald', 'executives', 'who', 'care', 'personally', 'what', 'company', 'limits', 'business', 'model', 'are', 'trying', 'change', 'company', 'common', 'good', 'admit', 'am', 'impressed', 'many', 'company', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'perfect', 'beginning', 'listen', 'critics', 'Spurlock', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'had', 'more', 'balance.Recommended', 'exercise', 'critical', 'intelligence']",N/A

We often think of processed food as innocuous, but the list of ingredients (some with known or possible carcinogens) is alarming and probably not easy for our bodies to process.  I watched this movie around the same time that I read Dr. Nicholas Perricone's ""The Perricone Promise.""  I gleaned quite a bit of info about nutrition from these two sources.  I had slowly been incorporating more organic produce into my diet and abstaining from fast food and junk food.  This movie and ""The Perricone Promise"" pushed me over the edge--I no longer eat fast food, and junk food doesn't even taste good anymore (far too sweet--""processed and cheap"" tasting).  Like Morgan, I am alarmed with the food that is being marketed to kids. I really like the scene where Morgan visits a school for at-risk students that serves only healthy foods--no desserts. The price tag without desserts is the same as the cheap-quality, prepackaged foods.  These kids are ""coincidentally"" behaving better and performing better in school.Let me vouch for my own personal testimony of improved energy level and mood after changing my diet. Let me offer my own ""smoking fries"" anecdote--a friend visited and accidentally let fall a Burger King French fry on her way out (I rewatched this movie with her and warned her not to eat the fries!!)--I placed this French fry outside my apartment on a ledge near the staircase--however, my apartment is located within a heated building, so the fry remained at room temperature.

Hundreds of people were ahead of us, thus, I waited eagerly to rent the ever so popular movie on DVD.  What a disappointment!To its credit, Supersize Me provided a much-needed indictment of the fast food industry in general, and McDonald's in particular.  It discussed the serious problem of obesity.  Just the other day, I read that obesity has now surpassed starvation as being the world's largest food problem -- pretty impressive and disconcerting considering how many poor people there are in the world who live on less than one dollar a day.But isn't this information well known?  Does it take a rocket scientist to understand that any one of us will feel sick if we rely on fast food alone, especially if we get double orders and monstrous doses of soda or milk shakes?  Come on!Morgan was brave to undergo his experiment and it proved that eating an outrageously bad diet will undermine good health much faster than anyone had thought.

Morgan Spurlock eats nothing but McDonald's for a month and the results are incredible.  The weight he puts on is amazing.  But it's not just the weight.  He looks haggard.  He goes through personality changes.  This meat is pumped full of so many various chemicals, downing a Big Mac is right up there with shooting up.  The doctors begin to plead with him to stop filming the documentary, because his health and his life are at risk.  Ironically, the same doctors said, early in the film, that they didn't think a month of McDonald's would change him much.  If one month of eating this poison can make doctors fear for his life, what is a lifetime of eating it doing to so many Americans?  This is necessary viewing, and those who really need to view it are the members of Congress.  They need to make laws preventing these cholesterol factories from selling future heart attacks and diabetes to our children.  They market this stuff on children's shows.

He goes over the 3 rules, that over the 30 days he has to eat food, drinks, from McDonald's only, and if McDonald's doesn't make it, he can't eat it. So he enlists the help of 3 doctors, and he sends his last supper eating wih his Vegan Chef girlfreind Alexandra Jamieson, whom he has since married. Also he can only Super Size it, if they aks him to. So for the first meal he gets a Susage Busisct, and an Egg McMuffin.

On the negative side (if my last comment wasn't already negative), he seems to have doomed his experiment from the outset when, after the first couple of days, he overindulges himself on food to the point of vomitting. Such overindulging may be enough to make anyone sick (including the audience who has to bear witness to the vomit). Supposedly, though, such overindulging occurred only when pressed to accept value meals by McD cashiers. However, Spurlock confesses that, after several weeks, eating was the only way to break free from between-meal depression (one of the most interesting claims in the movie, btw, was that such mood swings were caused by McD addiction). With that in mind, I'm supposing that he may have overindulged himself more than he divulged.After all is said and done, though, the film is effective, as well as entertaining (believe it or not).

770252,A2TZKXU6Q0EDNP,B0000B1OC4,Takis Tz.,"[4, 4]","Since mostly everyone knows by now what the film is about, i'll get straight to the facts about it.Starting from the negative.Spurlock's experiment suffers from many flaws, obvious with a naked eye. To begin with, even super-ultra-heavy McDonalds users dont eat 3 Mcmeals per day EVERY day. Yes, it is apparent why he chose to conduct the experiment this way but then again this doesnt constitute for realistic results.Secondly, to not include any other food aside Mcfood while he's doing his experiment is also over the top. No juices, no fruits, no vitamin supplemments even, nothing.  Thirdly he seems to have abandoned any body movement because he started eating for a month in McDonalds and not because his physical condition deteriorated. A deliberate decision then and not a result.It would've been way more rational, not to mention more believable (for those that insist on not getting the point mostly), to set up the experiment on a more realistic basis.Still, as i said above, it's no riddle why he chose to go this way. Fast food has many unpleasant health impacts which ARE immediate. But also several that aren't. It seems that the experimenter wanted to force those not-so-immediate results to surface faster.The effect on Spurlock's health after even 2 weeks of Mcdiet is truly alarming. With 3 doctors documenting and keeping track of the developments, the viewer has the results measured and evaluated right before his eyes. And the words of especially one of them drive the point through summarily: ""i thought alcohol could have such a devastating impact, but a fast food diet? Never thought it was possible"". More of the same is confirmed by the other physicians as Spurlock's liver is basically about to hit tilt and his cholesterol levels are sky-rocketing. Among other things...In the process of all this, and while we see burger after burger being swallowed and soda after soda (all super sized of course) being slurped, it never really gets boring. It's either the protagonist's humor keeping the whole thing together and going, or the all around facts about the food industry thrown in that might come as a shocking surprise to many but it's precisely those really that have brought the situation to what it is today.In the end, it's only the thick-headed that will avoid or insist on NOT getting the point. Besides, if you needed a movie to demonstrate all this to you, well, the problem is apparently all yours, isnt it?One of the most remarkable features of the film, was perhaps, the guy who's a Big Mac fanatic and who'd devoured literally 1000s of them over a span of 2 decades. Regretably in my opinion, no doctors' check-ups are done on him. It would be interesting to see just how resilient the human body is, and how much, after all, it all winds up being a result of mental state rather than merely ""physical state"".Dont miss out on the special features of the film and especially the interview with the author of ""Fastfood nation"".

Bollinger,"[2, 2]","One of the funniest documentaries around, &#8216;Super Size Me&#8217; is one of the few docs I have seen that manages to be educational and critical while also being funny, entertaining, and easy to watch. I stand by my statement that a documentary&#8217;s value should not be based on the content of its message, but rather on how effectively it communicates that message. In this regard, &#8216;Super Size Me&#8217; is strong and recommendable film.The primary force of communication in SSM is, of course, the host and narrator, Morgan Spurlock. In less than 100 minutes, he takes us on an engrossing and detailed tour through the lifestyle and diet of the average American. He highlights everything from our sedentary activity to our poor food choices, but he doesn&#8217;t stop there. Spurlock is also smart enough to see that the problems with eating in the USA is every bit controlled by the system itself as it is by the consumer. Criticism, justified with substantial and thoroughly explained evidence, is leveled at the school systems, the snack food industry, and, of course, the fast food enterprises.What really makes SSM work, though, is that Spurlock is such an entertaining and likable guide. I spent just as much time laughing as I did groaning and grimacing while watching this film. It&#8217;s Spurlock&#8217;s delivery that pulls this all together and makes us pay attention to him. HE is teaching us, and WE are learning. So many docs these days and in the past focus too little on the methods of communication of their subject matter &#8212; how exactly they transmit their message to the audience &#8212; instead relying on preachy, self-righteous narrators to bombard us with disturbing, awkward videos in the hopes that we will do something. For one Goddamned time, I didn&#8217;t feel liked I was being talked down to and preached at while watching a documentary. It was incredibly refreshing and extremely enjoyable.&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;SCORE: 8/10+ Morgan Spurlock&#8217;s hosting and narrating are the main selling point here. The guy&#8217;s sense of humor is cleverly utilized throughout the doc.+ The important information is delivered in simple, easy-to-understand chunks and it never comes across as condescending or boring.

In 1991, my friend and bandmate, Pip Biancamano, during a group conversation that was taking place in my health food store at the time, said with a wise smile: ""Better to swing with the King than to frown with the Clown!"" ... Wiser words have not been spoken in relation to frequenting the fast-food establishments that criss-cross our once healthy landscape. INDEED! ... McDonald's may have made some mighty decent burgers at one time (and some people think they still do!), but whatever you do, DON'T EAT THE FRIES !!! ... Buy, or rent, this DVD and make sure you watch the Special Features section when the movie ends. Watch the one about the experiment that Morgan did with the food put into the glass jars. Notice how the FRIES never go bad! These FRIES are the envy of ancient Egyptian embalmers! Whatever is in those fries, it's not breaking down in a normal, biodegradable manner. I'm serious. It will give you the chills. Notice how the guy with the long hair who has been eating the big macs every day since they first came to town - for DECADES! - never eats the FRIES! What is in those fries? Whatever it is, I wonder if it passes the U.S. Government's DELANEY CLAUSE standards for carcinogenic additives in processed food? ... I, myself, have been eating health foods since I was 15 years old, since 1971. I used to manage a health-food store in Massachusetts for almost four years, and after that I owned my own natural food store (AEOLIA: Whole Foods), in Lowell, Massachusetts for over 7 years. I've seen a lot of sickness and disease in my life, as well as a lot of very healthy human beings. I know this: stress, lack of exercise, lack of sleep, and eating junk-food will put you six feet under (all things being equal) sooner than drinking and drugging ever will. What I call ""The 6 White Devils"" (WHITE: sugar, salt, flour, pasta, rice, and fatty dairy products) will put you six feet under sooner than later. Add artificial additives, colorings, flavorings, preservatives, hormones, antibiotics, insecticides, pesticides, fungicides, herbicides, irradiation, and genetically engineered foods to that, and you've got an evil stew of chemicals just waiting to join with the free-radicals in your body, and all of the environmental toxins outside of your body, to do some mighty destruction that good old grandad and pure tobacco alone could never do. ... This is what Morgan is getting at in this great movie of his. He's a brave man, and a true sociologist who did real, living, sociological, qualitative field-research using himself as a guinea pig. You really gotta give him credit for that! Oh, and the interview he does with the author of Fast Food Nation, Eric Schlosser, is outstanding. My hat is off to both of these brave gentleman who are walking in the noble footsteps of Frances Moore Lappe, Dr. Paavo Airola, and John Robbins - among countless others. ... EAT NATURAL!...

The lawsuit was thrown out due to the fact that there was no concrete evidence that stated or showed the progressive weight gain the girls recieved from eating at McDonalds. This inspired filmmaker Morgan Spurlock to make ""Super Size Me"".Spurlock (he doesn't sound like the president for the hairclub for men, but, more of a spokesperson) takes a one month diet on McDonald's fast food (3 meals a day)and turns it into a gutbusting, eyepopping journey into how hazardous fast-food has become and how dangerous it could be in future generations.The film covers everything from the content in certain menu items to the addiction that has swept the nation, that has made obesity 1 of the leading killers in America.The most disgusting item is not in the film itself, but, in the bonus features on the disc.Spurlock had an experiment in which he took 7 jars and filled each with a different item from McDonald's, reserving the last two jars to a different restaurant that caters to making its own homemade fries using fresh potatoes & producing there own burger patties, getting the meat from a local butcher in the area (in other words, they use fresh meat as opposed to Mickey D's horsemeat).Over a 5 week experiment to see which item would bio-degrade the quickest, the fresh restaurant items degraded the quickest in the first 2 to 3weeks, with the McDonald's items very, very slowly degrading over the 5 week period. The only item that refused to degrade, even in the slightest, was shockingly enough the large fries that were from McDonald's.After a 5 week period of sitting in a jar, the large fries looked as if they were purchased an hour ago with no signs degradation at all. It made me think of what these fries do to the human digestive system. Ewww, gross.My suggestion is to avoid all fast food joints (none of them are good). the only place I can recommend, & I'm not plugging the franchise in any way, is Subway.

Under the supervision of three doctors and his vegan girlfriend, Spurlock goes on a 30 day diet exclusively at McDonald's and with no exercise.  He must eat everything off the menu at least once, and if asked to supersize his meal, he must say ""yes.""  It's not surprising that Morgan's heath deteriorates in those 30 days, but I (and neither did Spurlock, probably) didn't imagine that it would deteriorate so badly.  His blood pressure and cholesterol head north, his sex drive goes kaput, and he starts to develop a gut.  I'm glad a movie like this was made.  Though my diet isn't flawless, it's better than average, and I generally avoid McDonald's (though I SOMETIMES do crave for a Crispy Chicken), whose menu is so unhealthy, that even their ""premium"" salads are questionable in nutrition, especially if you add their fattening dressings.

Good vitals...cholesterol, blood pressure, nutrient concentrations in his blood, etc. all indicate a healthy adult male.  Until he decided to undertake a public health experiment.  For 30 straight days he ate three squares a day of nothing but food and drink off the McDonalds menu.  Morgan Spurlock went from being a healthy adult male -- according to at least three doctors -- to being on the verge of suicide by way of grease, salt, sugar, and fat.  Inside of a week his vitals took a nose dive; after three weeks his doctors were practically begging him to return to his normal diet; after his 30-day McBinge, Morgan Spurlock was no longer a healthy man.Super Size Me is a great documentary.  Spurlock's aim seemed to be to show the perils of all fastfood, not just McDonalds...he did a great job of it.  Spurlock does his best to show the culture of this country as far as it's eating habits...and the culture ain't pretty.  Spurlock elucidated brilliantly on common knowledge...that too much fat, sugar, and salt is VERY bad for you by showing what it has done to him over the course of his 30-day McBinge.  Food that is bad for you is just too easy to get your hands on in our society these days and it is costing us.  60% of Americans are overweight...McDonalds and its ilk certainly aren't the sole cause of this problem, but they don't help in the slightest.The only downside is that I don't think Spurlock does his best to get in touch with fastfood bigwigs.  Granted, he makes many phone calls to the public relations people at McDonalds, but he never forces the issue.  He never shows up on their doorstep and demands answers.  He should have.Any lack of point of view as presented by Mr. Spurlock is minor.  He interviews everyone he can get his hands on...including a former surgeon general of the US.  Overall, this documentary should not be missed.

So I'm going to take the approach that there are really two levels on which we need to look at ""Super Size Me"".First, I take my hat off to the filmmakers simply as businesspeople. I hope that doesn't sound too cynical, but honestly, I do. This is a film that could have been - and very likely was - made on a zero budget. Or something very close to zero, at any rate. And yet it's obviously been a huge international hit, doubtless raking in moolah by the truckload. The result? An ROI (return on investment) approaching infinity. McDonalds themselves should be taking notes from this guy!Not bad for someone whose business as a personal trainer was apparently in the process of going under.Now for the actual message of the film. Is putting one man on a McDonalds-only diet a simplistic way of addressing the very real and very serious obesity epidemic plaguing  not only America, but also the entire developed world? Of course it is! Nevertheless, there is a valid underlying point here. The proliferation of this kind of diet, and the power of the food industry to promote this diet unhindered, actually do represent serious social, medical, and ultimately even economic problems. Yes, poor health is an enormous drain on our economy.As a way of addressing these problems, this film has all the depth and rigor of a sound bite. Whether you like progressive politics or not, ""Super Size Me"" doesn't even approach the level of analysis we get in films likeThe Corporation (2-Disc Special Edition)orEnron: The Smartest Guys in the Room.But... as with any good sound bite, that's really ultimately irrelevant. It's not about analysis. It's about a grab for our attention. So as long as we understand that and treat this film as such, it may actually do a great deal of good. Because like it or not, the issues that it deals with do genuinely warrant our attention.Like it or not, we do have a real problem here.Theo.",4,A clever vehicle for self promotion...

These days, we Americans hardly ever cook anything.  We eat out, or order out all the time.  When we do ""cook"", it just means that we open a can of this or a box of that.  We have lost our food culture and we are destroying ourselves as a nice bonus.  We need to reject or at least reduce our reliance on processed foods, and get back to cooking again.What I found most disturbing in the film was what goes on in the school lunch programs across the US.  I remember that when I was in high school we generally had a choice between cheeseburgers or pizza.  This pure garbage is pushed on our kids, and they learn a lifetime of bad eating habits which causes the epidemic in obesity that we're experiencing now.  To make matters worse, a lot of kids are eating out of candy-filled vending machines.  To illustrate a point, Spurlock shows one school for troubled teens which introduced a healthy lunch in its cafeteria.  After the switch, problems with violence and outburst dropped signifigantly.  Without the chemicals of processed food racing through their veins, they began to act like normal humans.  What does that tell you?I really recommend for everyone to see this.

But after seeing it , I felt that the only thing worth creating buzz , was the astonishing fact , that it ever got picked up and produced into a motion picture. It lacks everything that captured my interest , in the first place. It lacked originality , new information , and more importantly , it lacked the ability to keep me from looking at the clock and wondering when it'd be over. Personally , I used to be fat. So , I can sympathize with overweight people and "" our "" plight. I say ""our"" , because even though I lost my weight ( 100 lbs. ), there's still a hungry little Fat Albert , inside me. Anyway , it doesn't affect my overall opinion about the basis of this film. They ( director/ writer ) , claim that McDonalds misleads the customer about the dangers of overeating their food. But I've eaten McDonalds food every since I was a little lad and have never thrown up or eaten myself into an oblivious state of obesity or sickness , because of it. So , to anyone who has eaten at any fast food place on the basis of eating healthy....I say.....DUH !! Unfortunately , after the first twenty minutes into ""Supersize Me"" , that's all I thought of , for the remainder of the film. I don't recommend renting it , and I especially don't suggest buying it. It does have a good soundtrack and it was edited fantastically. However , it weaves away from the original experiment ( him eating Micky D's for a month , for every meal , and supersizes every one ) , and veers into the overall eating issues in America. Issues not only with McDonalds but with ice cream franchises and the school systems across the USA. Basically , turning the film into an undercover exploitation of corporate abilities to mislead the public, while stuffing their pockets with consumer cash. Meanwhile , we all die slowly. Again...I say DUH !! That's what businesses do ! And if you don't get that , then you're probably one of those people that supersize everything, smoke six packs of cigarettes a day and then wonder why your chest hurts. While this film is probably amuzing to the folks who find humor in watching someone exagerate their points by scarfing food until they're on the deathbed , it's mesmerizing aura escaped me.

It is a good concept and usually works well, but inherit in the idea is the possibility of exploitation--it could be very easy for someone to perform an experiment to exploit a particular idea, viewpoint, etc. That's kind of what happens in SUPER SIZE ME.In SUPER SIZE ME filmmaker Morgan Spurlock performs a month-long ""experiment"". For 30 days he will only eat food from McDonalds. His ""rules"" are fairly simple: he has to eat three meals a day, he must consume everything on the McDonald's menu at least once, and if anyone asks him to supersize his order he has to do so. Spurlock consults two doctors and a nutritionist before he begins his ""experiment"" and he returns once a week during his trial. At the beginning of the adventure Spurlock is completely healthy. Those are the ""rule"" and Spurlock follows them rigidly. During his 30 day adventure he also travels across the country meeting various interesting and quirky people to make the documentary more interesting: from a guy who eats nothing except two or three Big Macs a day to an innovated PE instructor in Naperville, IL who has developed an exercise bike attached to a video game. At the end of his 30 day jaunt, Spurlock has extremely high cholesterol and blood pressure and his liver has almost become liquefied. It's all quite extraordinary and shocking. I've heard of people who have become vegetarians and vegans after watching SUPER SIZE ME.I enjoyed SUPER SIZE ME. It has a lot of good information and is quite entertaining. Ah, but there's the quick. The film isn't just entertaining, it's too entertaining. In doing what he does best, Spurlock reveals his hand. SUPER SIZE ME pretends to be an inquiry-based scientific study of sorts, but in reality is an exploitive movie to attack the fast food industry and the unfair and inhumane treatment of the animals they breed, raise, and buy so that they can sell their food. Don't get me wrong. I agree that the slaughter houses in which many animals are forced to live should be shut down--ranchers can earn more money, raise healthier animals, etc. if animals are allowed to be raised they way God intended and not forced to live a caged existence in feces, bile, and vomit.However, SUPER SIZE ME pretends to not be a movie about that and instead a movie about the way the fast food industry affects average Americans. In the film, careful fallacies are used in an attempt to force a predetermined reaction from the viewer. One of Spurlock's rules is that he must eat three square meals a day. Well, most Americans don't eat a full three meals a day. Spurlock insists on having dessert with all of his meals and the only meal I've ever been used to eating dessert at is dinner. Spurlock stops exercising when he begins his experiment. Granted many Americans aren't very physical, but even the most disappointed and cynical person completes some form of exercise that Spurlock doesn't give them credit for. Also, Spurlock eats huge portions of food at each meal everyday. Most people don't do that. Of course, I've never heard of a person (except that guy who eats three Big Macs a day) who eats at McDonald's everyday.Despite knowing this duplicity, SUPER SIZE ME still remains as a very entertaining and semi-education documentary. If nothing else, it makes a great focal point conversational piece.

Morgan Spurlock and the crew of ""Super Size Me"" have achieved in their first outing what has continued to elude numerous Hollywood documentarians who have been at work for years: a cohesive story.Granted, this movie isn't exactly the 'fly-on-the-wall' technique that creates a true and unobstructed documentary, but it does present a coherent and well-executed argument with a tremendous amount of detail. Whereas the other big documentary of 2004, ""Fahrenheit 9/11,"" meandered and wandered all over the map, without ever fashioning a logical or legitimate argument not based in personal opinion, ""Super Size Me"" has crafted a concise statement.

770269,A17JVVAKWEB0M,B0000B1OC4,Wesley Mullins,"[3, 5]","In the recent ""you made me fat"" lawsuits, fast-food behemoth McDonald's claimed the plaintiffs did not prove that a diet exclusively comprised of food from McDonald-land would cause health problems.  The judge agreed, claiming such a hypothesis could not ever be tested...until now.  Inspired by wording from the judges decision, documentary filmmaker Morgan Spurlock attempts to test that premise by going on a month-long binge of Big Macs, Chicken McNuggets and Hot Fudge Sundaes in his groundbreaking film Super Size Me.Claiming he is living every eight-year-old's dream, Morgan survives an entire February (and a few days of March) by first frequenting the McDonalds around his Manhattan home and then by traveling the country to see Micky-Dees (and its fans) all across the USA.  He has four rules for himself; He must eat everything on the menu a least once, have three meals a day, only eat food from McDonald's, and when asked, ""would you like to Super Size it?"" he has to do it.Inter-cut with Morgan's story (visits to doctors for check-ups, his deteriorating relationship with his vegan girlfriend and accounts of his condition) are journalistic stories of school lunch programs, decreased funding of PE, stories of gastric bypass surgery, interviews with people on the street and expert accounts of the indoctrination of young kids practiced by McDonald's (clowns, toys, happy meals, cartoons, birthday parties, etc).Viewers should remain skeptical about Spurlock as scientific researcher.  While only a fool would argue with the premise that McDonald's serves unhealthy food, one must understand that the average person would not gain thirty pounds and have the disastrous side-effects Morgan suffers by switching to fast-food for a month.  He commits the age-old problem with scientific research of wanting to achieve powerful results and then doing whatever it takes to get there.  He eats huge meals (even so much he makes himself throw up) and goes from an active lifestyle to only walking to and from McDonald's.  Clearly, McDonald's is bad, but not as bad as he makes it appear with this self-fulfilling ""experiment"".He does gain some credibility by truthfully addressing issues that are at odds with his position.  He discusses the need for people to display more personal responsibility with their choices and talks to a very healthy man who eats nearly a thousand Big Macs per year, having at least two EVERY day.Overall, Super Size Me represents a new wave of documentary film, as Morgan invents a story and becomes a character in his own journalism.  Along with the films of Errol Morris and Michael Moore that have already pushed this genre into new realms, Super Size Me will no doubt inspire a generation of filmmakers to create their own similar films.",4,"Entertaining case study, but not exactly scientific research",1102291200,"12 6, 2004",2004,2779,"['recent', 'made', 'fat', 'lawsuits', 'fast-food', 'McDonald', 'claimed', 'plaintiffs', 'did', 'not', 'prove', 'diet', 'exclusively', 'comprised', 'food', 'McDonald-land', 'would', 'cause', 'health', 'problems', 'judge', 'agreed', 'claiming', 'hypothesis', 'could', 'not', 'ever', 'be', 'tested', 'now', 'Inspired', 'wording', 'judges', 'decision', 'documentary', 'filmmaker', 'Morgan', 'Spurlock', 'attempts', 'test', 'premise', 'going', 'month-long', 'binge', 'Big', 'Macs', 'Chicken', 'McNuggets', 'Hot', 'Fudge', 'Sundaes', 'groundbreaking', 'film', 'Super', 'Size', 'Me.Claiming', 'living', 'eight-year-old', 'dream', 'Morgan', 'entire', 'February', 'few', 'days', 'March', 'first', 'frequenting', 'McDonalds', 'Manhattan', 'home', 'then', 'traveling', 'country', 'see', 'Micky-Dees', 'fans', 'USA', 'four', 'rules', 'must', 'eat', 'everything', 'menu', 'least', 'once', 'have', 'three', 'meals', 'day', 'only', 'eat', 'food', 'McDonald', 'when', 'asked', 'would', 'Super', 'Size', 'do', 'it.Inter-cut', 'Morgan', 'story', 'visits', 'doctors', 'check-ups', 'deteriorating', 'relationship', 'vegan', 'girlfriend', 'accounts', 'condition', 'are', 'journalistic', 'stories', 'school', 'lunch', 'programs', 'decreased', 'funding', 'PE', 'stories', 'gastric', 'bypass', 'surgery', 'interviews', 'people', 'street', 'expert', 'accounts', 'indoctrination', 'young', 'kids', 'practiced', 'McDonald', 'clowns', 'toys', 'happy', 'meals', 'cartoons', 'birthday', 'parties', 'etc', '.Viewers', 'should', 'remain', 'skeptical', 'about', 'Spurlock', 'scientific', 'researcher', 'only', 'fool', 'would', 'argue', 'premise', 'McDonald', 'serves', 'unhealthy', 'food', 'one', 'must', 'understand', 'average', 'person', 'would', 'not', 'gain', 'thirty', 'pounds', 'have', 'disastrous', 'side-effects', 'Morgan', 'suffers', 'switching', 'fast-food', 'month', 'age-old', 'problem', 'scientific', 'research', 'wanting', 'achieve', 'powerful', 'results', 'then', 'doing', 'get', 'there', 'huge', 'meals', 'even', 'so', 'much', 'throw', 'up', 'active', 'lifestyle', 'only', 'walking', 'McDonald', 'Clearly', 'McDonald', 'bad', 'not', 'as', 'bad', 'appear', 'self-fulfilling', 'experiment', '.He', 'gain', 'credibility', 'truthfully', 'addressing', 'issues', 'are', 'odds', 'position', 'need', 'people', 'display', 'more', 'personal', 'responsibility', 'choices', 'talks', 'very', 'healthy', 'man', 'who', 'nearly', 'thousand', 'Big', 'Macs', 'year', 'having', 'least', 'two', 'EVERY', 'day.Overall', 'Super', 'Size', 'Me', 'new', 'wave', 'documentary', 'film', 'Morgan', 'story', 'character', 'own', 'journalism', 'films', 'Errol', 'Morris', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'have', 'already', 'pushed', 'genre', 'new', 'realms', 'Super', 'Size', 'Me', 'will', 'doubt', 'inspire', 'generation', 'filmmakers', 'create', 'own', 'similar', 'films']",N/A
770270,A16S0WDRIAHKB2,B0000B1OC4,"William Rothberg ""wrothberg64""","[8, 14]","I'm giving this film four stars based on the following: Five stars as entertainment and three stars as a documentary.I found the film to be highly entertaining, almost riveting. I give Spurlock a lot of credit for being able to take a potentially boring topic, the health effects of fast food, and make such an interesting film about it.  Although you would think that most consumers know that fried foods and milkshakes are bad for you, hopefully Spurlock's film will make people think more about the health effects of what they eat.The problem is that Spurlock obviously has an axe to grind. He is a vegetarian into health food and he hasn't been fully honest in his condemnation of large companies that sell cheap, less healthy meals.  He appears to have staged scenes, such as when he vomits on screen, and goes so far as to make the outrageous claim that McDonalds food is addictive.  You have to be suspicious about his claim to have only eaten three meals a day at McDonalds for a month.  Given his liberties with the the truth, it is certainly possible that, when the camera was off, he was gulping down more junk food to make his health deteriorate more than it would have otherwise.And then there is a problem with the message: While it is true that most corporate fast food isn't very healthy, the alternatives - small business hamburger, pizza, Chinese joints - aren't very healthy either.  Bad food isn't worse because it comes from a large corporation.  Near where I work, one of the healthiest places for a cheap lunch is the corporate chain restaurant Subway.One theme of the film is how fast food chains target children, but if they aren't spending money on fast food, then children would be spending their money on stuff like candy, chocolate bars, chips, soda, twinkies and ice cream sandwiches.  Spurlock is kidding himself if he thinks that, in the absence of fast food chains, children are going to spend their money on healthy fruits and vegetables.Also, Spurlock places too much blame on the seller and not enough on the buyer.  Many consumers don't care enough about their health and favor food that tastes good over food that is good for you.  And they also demand large portions.  Corporate fast food chains wouldn't be so successful if they didn't give the people what they want.Too many Americans eat too much unhealthy food but there is nothing wrong with eating at fast food restaurants once in a while. We would all be much healthier eating stuff like tofu and seaweed all of the time, but life certainly wouldn't be as much fun.

I had to cover my mouth with my hand and I literally got the shivers happening throughout this outrageous and educational documentary. I feel exactly the same way like his girlfriend who is a vegan chef and had not had fast food for more than 10 years. The last time I had a meal at McDonald's or a fast food chain was more than 2 years ago when I was on a roadtrip when it was located at the rest areas.America really needs to abandon the fast food restaurants for their health. This film documented some very engrossing reality about the negative health effects of fast food. People are not born fat, and it's what they eat that caused the nasty changes. Spurlock got very sick and gained weight drastically after just a few weeks on the disastrous diet. It was a suicidal diet! His experiment is a representation of millions of Americans who are obese and sick, and are ignorant or careless about the health issues. The kids at the school cafeterias are also ""endangered"", because they are consuming nasty fast food too! Instead of going to the fast food chains, people should serious go pick up some health cook books and start going to the gym, before turning the beaches into an awefully unattractive sight.There's some inspirational interviews of some people who have turn away from fast food and become healthy again. One guy lost a ton of weight, and his old jeans from his fat days were super-size! After his 30 days McDonalds diet, Spurlocks' health was drastically affected as follow: Massive headaches, mood swings, depressed and exhausted, 2x heart failure, 2x heart disease, fat liver, massive cravings, cholesterol 230, gained 24.5 lbs, and worthiness. So there, is that shocking! And he was told by the doctors not to eat that food for a year.Yes, people have choices, but most are not thinking about the consequences! Anyone who are still eating fast food on a daily or weekly basis, should defintely check this movie out. I am sure it will blow them away. Instead of putting on the fat mass, how about muscle mass?

770274,A2UVJD6OOLKEBR,B0000B1OC4,yaremar,"[9, 12]","I'm old enough to remember when McDonald's first opened. Since then, my favorite McDonald's meal-in fact, my favorite fast food meal-has remained steadfastly the same: two regular hamburgers (single patty, which is all they sold for a long time), a small order of fries (which was a ""regular"" size way back when), and a regular size soda. In the intervening years, I've seen the burger patties get stacked like pancakes, the buns inflate to whole loaf proportions, mayonnaise slathered on everything like pus on an infected wound, and drink containers grow to the size of baby carriages.I wasn't exposed to these oddball combinations in my youth, so I've generally steered clear of them as an adult. That's because, for me, McDonald's food is about habit as much as it is about taste. But I also realize there are millions of Americans out there who can't remember a time when there weren't any Big Macs and Quarter Pounders; so whether it's individual taste or just poor eating habits, the simple fact is we're a nation of Big Fat Asses. And the fast food industry is doing its share to see that we remain that way.Morgan Spurlock's documentary SUPER SIZE ME zeroes in on this national health crisis. Spurlock serves himself up as the guinea pig for this extended video diary: For 90 consecutive meals (three full meals a day for 30 days), he only consumes those food and beverages that are on the McDonald's menu. If McDonald's doesn't sell it, he can't have it. Another stipulation is that whenever one of the burger jockeys asks him if he wants to ""Super Size"" his meal, his answer must be yes. To the surprise and horror of our hero, his girlfriend (a vegan chef who compares ham to heroin), and the three doctors monitoring his condition, Spurlock packs on the pounds as his heart rate, blood pressure, and cholesterol level go haywire.As Spurlock's physical (and mental) state declines, he visits schools and discovers an appalling lack of food care (most lunchroom meals consist of sugar and starch-based products) and physical education programs (Illinois is the only state in the country where exercise is mandatory). What Spurlock uncovers about the rampant problem of obesity is alternately hilarious, enlightening, disturbing, and depressing.For all its effective moments, SUPER SIZE ME, like many documentaries, stacks the deck in its favor. For instance, there's a scene where a kid can't identify a picture of Jesus Christ yet readily knows who Ronald McDonald is. That's pretty amusing stuff, Morgan, but where's the footage of all those children who gave the correct answer? Likewise, Spurlock focuses in on so many bloated stomachs and chunky asses that we wonder if this is social commentary or just some weird fixation.But there's no denying the detrimental effect the all-McDonald's diet has on Spurlock himself. One telling moment comes on the third day, when he barely finishes one of the meals and winds up vomiting only a few minutes later. And thanks to Spurlock, thousands of mediocre stand-up comics will finally get the answer to their rhetorical question, ""What part of the chicken does a McNugget come from?""I doubt whether SUPER SIZE ME will affect any substantial changes on the way they sell and we buy fast food. But it's a thought-provoking, must-see movie that sheds light on an important subject many of us take for granted: Nutrition.",4,Fast food for thought,1133049600,"11 27, 2005",2005,3374,"[""'m"", 'old', 'enough', 'remember', 'when', 'McDonald', 'first', 'opened', 'then', 'favorite', 'McDonald', 'meal-in', 'fact', 'favorite', 'fast', 'food', 'meal-has', 'remained', 'steadfastly', 'same', 'two', 'regular', 'hamburgers', 'single', 'patty', 'sold', 'long', 'time', 'small', 'order', 'fries', 'was', 'regular', 'size', 'way', 'back', 'when', 'regular', 'size', 'soda', 'intervening', 'years', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'burger', 'patties', 'get', 'stacked', 'pancakes', 'buns', 'inflate', 'whole', 'loaf', 'proportions', 'mayonnaise', 'slathered', 'everything', 'pus', 'infected', 'wound', 'drink', 'containers', 'grow', 'size', 'baby', 'carriages.I', 'was', ""n't"", 'exposed', 'oddball', 'combinations', 'youth', ""'ve"", 'generally', 'steered', 'clear', 'adult', 'because', 'McDonald', 'food', 'about', 'habit', 'as', 'much', 'taste', 'also', 'realize', 'are', 'millions', 'Americans', 'there', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'time', 'when', 'were', ""n't"", 'Big', 'Macs', 'Quarter', 'Pounders', 'so', 'individual', 'taste', 'just', 'poor', 'eating', 'habits', 'simple', 'fact', ""'re"", 'nation', 'Big', 'Fat', 'Asses', 'fast', 'food', 'industry', 'doing', 'share', 'see', 'remain', 'way.Morgan', 'Spurlock', 'documentary', 'SUPER', 'SIZE', 'ME', 'national', 'health', 'crisis', 'Spurlock', 'up', 'guinea', 'pig', 'extended', 'video', 'diary', '90', 'consecutive', 'meals', 'three', 'full', 'meals', 'day', '30', 'days', 'only', 'food', 'beverages', 'are', 'McDonald', 'menu', 'McDonald', ""n't"", 'sell', 'ca', ""n't"", 'have', 'stipulation', 'whenever', 'one', 'burger', 'jockeys', 'Super', 'Size', 'meal', 'answer', 'must', 'be', 'yes', 'surprise', 'horror', 'hero', 'girlfriend', 'vegan', 'chef', 'who', 'ham', 'heroin', 'three', 'doctors', 'monitoring', 'condition', 'Spurlock', 'pounds', 'heart', 'rate', 'blood', 'pressure', 'cholesterol', 'level', 'go', 'haywire.As', 'Spurlock', 'physical', 'mental', 'state', 'declines', 'schools', 'discovers', 'appalling', 'lack', 'food', 'care', 'most', 'lunchroom', 'meals', 'consist', 'sugar', 'starch-based', 'products', 'physical', 'education', 'programs', 'Illinois', 'only', 'state', 'country', 'where', 'exercise', 'mandatory', 'What', 'Spurlock', 'uncovers', 'rampant', 'problem', 'obesity', 'alternately', 'hilarious', 'enlightening', 'disturbing', 'depressing.For', 'effective', 'moments', 'SUPER', 'SIZE', 'ME', 'many', 'documentaries', 'deck', 'favor', 'instance', 'scene', 'where', 'kid', 'ca', ""n't"", 'identify', 'picture', 'Jesus', 'Christ', 'yet', 'readily', 'who', 'Ronald', 'McDonald', 'pretty', 'amusing', 'stuff', 'Morgan', 'where', 'footage', 'children', 'who', 'gave', 'correct', 'answer', 'Likewise', 'Spurlock', 'so', 'many', 'bloated', 'stomachs', 'chunky', 'asses', 'wonder', 'social', 'commentary', 'just', 'weird', 'fixation.But', 'denying', 'detrimental', 'effect', 'all-McDonald', 'diet', 'Spurlock', 'One', 'telling', 'moment', 'third', 'day', 'when', 'barely', 'one', 'meals', 'up', 'vomiting', 'only', 'few', 'minutes', 'later', 'thanks', 'Spurlock', 'thousands', 'mediocre', 'stand-up', 'comics', 'will', 'finally', 'get', 'answer', 'rhetorical', 'question', 'What', 'part', 'chicken', 'McNugget', 'come', 'doubt', 'SUPER', 'SIZE', 'ME', 'will', 'affect', 'substantial', 'changes', 'way', 'sell', 'buy', 'fast', 'food', 'thought-provoking', 'must-see', 'movie', 'light', 'important', 'subject', 'many', 'take', 'granted', 'Nutrition']",N/A
770275,AP3B615GM191G,B0000B1OC4,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[1, 2]","Most of us probably have fond memories (whether recent or from childhood) of McDonald's and the fast food business as a whole.  In ""Super Size Me"", Morgan Spurlock takes a look ""behind the counter"", so to speak, in order to show us what that business really looks like.The premise of Spurlock's little experiment is quite simple: He will eat nothing but McDonald's food for an entire month (three meals a day), and has to super-size the meal if asked.  His health is extensively tested at the beginning of his quest, and is also tested at certain points throughout the experiment to see how the McFood is treating him.There really are two ways to look at this documentary:First, there's Spurlock's experiment itself, which needs to be taken with more than a few grains of salt.  Though he makes it seem as if the ""McDonald's Diet"" is killing him, there are many other factors not considered.  He pukes up one burger on the very first day (a little suspicious), his exercise and lifestyle habits are never explained (two weeks into the experiment he actually LOSES a pound over the course of a week), and he runs into one gentleman who eats the equivalent of three Big Macs a day yet still looks fit as a fiddle.  Thus, there are many inconsistencies to the basic Spurlock experiment premise.However, what really made this movie stick out for me was the parts that shed light onto the business-doings of the fast food industry itself.  Though obviously each consumer is ultimately responsible for what he/she puts in his/her mouth, Spurlock makes a compelling case that ""Corporate Fast Food"" is truly integrated into so many facets of our daily life.  They spend billions on advertising, ensconce themselves in the schools, and market themselves as family-friendly as possible.  All the while, they are putting out a product that (no matter what your stance on fast food may be) is probably not helping us become any healthier.About the only thing I wish I would have seen from this doc is Spurlock putting a bit more of the onus on actual consumers, as without their dollars the fast food business world would crumble.  Other than that, however, I believe that (experiment aside) Spurlock does a noble job of exposing potentially clueless consumers to the ""other side of the counter"", so to speak.  Sometimes, people need a wake-up call to change their ways, and this definitely qualifies as that.",5,Looking Behind The Counter,1313280000,"08 14, 2011",2011,2397,"['Most', 'probably', 'have', 'fond', 'memories', 'recent', 'childhood', 'McDonald', 'fast', 'food', 'business', 'whole', 'Super', 'Size', 'Me', 'Morgan', 'Spurlock', 'look', 'counter', 'so', 'speak', 'order', 'show', 'what', 'business', 'really', 'like.The', 'premise', 'Spurlock', 'little', 'experiment', 'quite', 'simple', 'will', 'eat', 'nothing', 'McDonald', 'food', 'entire', 'month', 'three', 'meals', 'day', 'super-size', 'meal', 'asked', 'health', 'extensively', 'tested', 'beginning', 'quest', 'also', 'tested', 'certain', 'points', 'experiment', 'see', 'how', 'McFood', 'treating', 'him.There', 'really', 'are', 'two', 'ways', 'look', 'documentary', 'First', 'Spurlock', 'experiment', 'be', 'taken', 'more', 'few', 'grains', 'salt', 'seem', 'McDonald', 'Diet', 'killing', 'are', 'many', 'other', 'factors', 'not', 'considered', 'up', 'one', 'burger', 'very', 'first', 'day', 'little', 'suspicious', 'exercise', 'lifestyle', 'habits', 'are', 'never', 'explained', 'two', 'weeks', 'experiment', 'actually', 'pound', 'course', 'week', 'one', 'gentleman', 'who', 'equivalent', 'three', 'Big', 'Macs', 'day', 'yet', 'still', 'fit', 'fiddle', 'Thus', 'are', 'many', 'inconsistencies', 'basic', 'Spurlock', 'experiment', 'premise.However', 'what', 'really', 'made', 'movie', 'out', 'was', 'parts', 'shed', 'light', 'business-doings', 'fast', 'food', 'industry', 'obviously', 'consumer', 'ultimately', 'responsible', 'what', 'he/she', 'his/her', 'mouth', 'Spurlock', 'compelling', 'case', 'Corporate', 'Fast', 'Food', 'truly', 'integrated', 'so', 'many', 'facets', 'daily', 'life', 'spend', 'billions', 'advertising', 'ensconce', 'schools', 'market', 'as', 'family-friendly', 'possible', 'while', 'are', 'putting', 'out', 'product', 'matter', 'what', 'stance', 'fast', 'food', 'may', 'be', 'probably', 'not', 'helping', 'become', 'healthier.About', 'only', 'thing', 'wish', 'would', 'have', 'seen', 'doc', 'Spurlock', 'putting', 'bit', 'more', 'onus', 'actual', 'consumers', 'dollars', 'fast', 'food', 'business', 'world', 'would', 'crumble', 'Other', 'however', 'believe', 'experiment', 'aside', 'Spurlock', 'noble', 'job', 'exposing', 'potentially', 'clueless', 'consumers', 'other', 'side', 'counter', 'so', 'speak', 'Sometimes', 'people', 'need', 'wake-up', 'call', 'change', 'ways', 'definitely']",N/A
