681182,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00005S8KV,Andrew Ellington,"[4, 4]","Albert Finney is quite possibly one of my favorite actors working today, and quite frankly one of my favorite actors who has ever worked in cinema.  Surprisingly the first film I ever saw of his was `Erin Brockovich', but it was that stunning portrayal of Erin's grumpy yet heartwarming boss that hooked me and moved me to find everything I could starring this man.  Since then I've seen just about all of his films (I've still got a few coming on Netflix) and I have to say that Finney very rarely fails to deliver.`Saturday Night and Sunday Morning' was Finney's first leading role, and what a stellar debut this proved to be.  Winning for himself a BAFTA for his portrayal of a reckless steal worker, Finney instantly shot himself to `in demand' actor status.Finney plays Arthur Seaton, a young and wild steal worker who lives (or merely stays awake) day in and day out in order to make enough money to drink and be merry on the weekends (sounds familiar ').  Seaton has his work cut out for him though, carrying on a relationship with a married woman while trying to keep his unsuspecting girlfriend unsuspecting.  His feelings for Brenda (the married woman) continue to grow, but when they find themselves in a tight spot (I smell a baby in the oven) Seaton's next moves become more and more desperate and pertinent.The question is; when is it time to grow up and take responsibility?The films title, `Saturday Night and Sunday Morning', refers to that very question.  Saturday night we party, we have fun, we remain reckless; but Sunday morning we awake to a new set of problems and we become aware of the necessity to own up to our mistakes.The film also speaks loudly about the feeling of suffocation within our respective classes.  There is a layer of desperation that you can feel seeping into the actions of each character, in particular Brenda who seems the most affected by her lot in life.  Arthur and his girlfriend Doreen seem almost unfazed by what is expected of them or really where they are headed, yet it becomes apparent that Arthur is longing for something more; and as his own decisions begin to catch up with him we can see his life finally blossoming in his eyes.  Arthur's very views of his parents and the people around him, the waste of life he sees, almost contradicts his very actions yet as one peers into what makes Arthur tick they can see that he is most ashamed of becoming what he so despises.  He's fallen into the rut of what society has delegated to him, and as much as he hates it he fails to embrace what could make him transcend it.`Saturday Night and Sunday Morning' is a very nicely crafted social piece that has the acting chops to match the important message provided within the films script.  Karel Reisz handles the film very nicely, giving the actors room to develop their characters and deliver something strong and memorable.  This is one of Albert Finney's finest moments, and it rightfully jumpstarted his very, very impressive career.",5,A surprisingly astute social commentary...,1235433600,"02 24, 2009",2009,2989,"['Albert', 'Finney', 'quite', 'possibly', 'one', 'favorite', 'actors', 'working', 'today', 'quite', 'frankly', 'one', 'favorite', 'actors', 'who', 'ever', 'worked', 'cinema', 'Surprisingly', 'first', 'film', 'ever', 'saw', 'was', 'Erin', 'Brockovich', 'was', 'stunning', 'portrayal', 'Erin', 'grumpy', 'yet', 'heartwarming', 'boss', 'hooked', 'moved', 'find', 'everything', 'could', 'starring', 'man', 'then', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'just', 'films', ""'ve"", 'still', 'got', 'few', 'coming', 'Netflix', 'have', 'say', 'Finney', 'very', 'rarely', 'deliver.', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Sunday', 'Morning', 'was', 'Finney', 'first', 'leading', 'role', 'what', 'stellar', 'debut', 'proved', 'be', 'Winning', 'BAFTA', 'portrayal', 'reckless', 'steal', 'worker', 'Finney', 'instantly', 'shot', 'demand', 'actor', 'status.Finney', 'Arthur', 'Seaton', 'young', 'wild', 'steal', 'worker', 'who', 'merely', 'stays', 'awake', 'day', 'day', 'out', 'order', 'make', 'enough', 'money', 'drink', 'be', 'merry', 'weekends', 'sounds', 'familiar', 'Seaton', 'work', 'cut', 'out', 'carrying', 'relationship', 'married', 'woman', 'trying', 'keep', 'unsuspecting', 'girlfriend', 'unsuspecting', 'feelings', 'Brenda', 'married', 'woman', 'continue', 'grow', 'when', 'find', 'tight', 'spot', 'smell', 'baby', 'oven', 'Seaton', 'next', 'become', 'more', 'more', 'desperate', 'pertinent.The', 'question', 'when', 'time', 'grow', 'up', 'take', 'responsibility', 'films', 'title', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Sunday', 'Morning', 'refers', 'very', 'question', 'Saturday', 'night', 'party', 'have', 'fun', 'remain', 'reckless', 'Sunday', 'morning', 'awake', 'new', 'set', 'problems', 'become', 'aware', 'necessity', 'own', 'up', 'mistakes.The', 'film', 'also', 'loudly', 'feeling', 'suffocation', 'respective', 'classes', 'layer', 'desperation', 'can', 'feel', 'seeping', 'actions', 'character', 'particular', 'Brenda', 'who', 'most', 'affected', 'lot', 'life', 'Arthur', 'girlfriend', 'Doreen', 'seem', 'almost', 'unfazed', 'what', 'expected', 'really', 'where', 'are', 'headed', 'apparent', 'Arthur', 'longing', 'something', 'more', 'own', 'decisions', 'begin', 'catch', 'up', 'can', 'see', 'life', 'finally', 'blossoming', 'eyes', 'Arthur', 'very', 'views', 'parents', 'people', 'waste', 'life', 'almost', 'very', 'actions', 'yet', 'one', 'peers', 'what', 'Arthur', 'can', 'see', 'most', 'ashamed', 'becoming', 'what', 'so', 'fallen', 'rut', 'what', 'society', 'delegated', 'as', 'much', 'embrace', 'what', 'could', 'make', 'transcend', 'it.', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Sunday', 'Morning', 'very', 'nicely', 'crafted', 'social', 'piece', 'acting', 'chops', 'match', 'important', 'message', 'provided', 'films', 'script', 'Karel', 'Reisz', 'film', 'very', 'nicely', 'giving', 'actors', 'room', 'develop', 'characters', 'deliver', 'something', 'strong', 'memorable', 'one', 'Albert', 'Finney', 'finest', 'moments', 'rightfully', 'jumpstarted', 'very', 'very', 'impressive', 'career']",N/A

For sure there is a lot of despair on display here but there is also a glimmer of hope for happiness.  Arthur Seaton (Albert Finney), stuck in a meaningless job with little hope for advancement beyond his class, doesn't so much lash out but engages in wreckless and self-destructive behavior.  He drinks to excess, he carries on affair with a meek co-worker's wife (Rachel Roberts), he torments a busy-body neighbor with an air gun, he teases the ladies at his plant with a dead rat.  Arthur isn't so much angry just stifled.  The best chance for redemption is the love of a working-class girl, Doreen (Shirley-Anne Field).  Arthur just basically has to do some growing up and brush off the inequities of class-conscious Britain.  Finney absolutely mesmerizes in his starring debut.  For sure, Arthur engages in some outrageous behavior, but Finney never overplays it.  Director Karel Reisz perfectly captures the grimy working class milieu.  Essential viewing.

681185,A313OU4NOWZDBY,B00005S8KV,David R. Allen,"[1, 1]","Saturday Night And Sunday Morning (1960) Is The Best ""Angry Young Man"" Movie Of All.Saturday Night And Sunday Morning (1960) starring Albert Finney, Shirley Anne Field, Rachel Roberts, and Norman Rossington is a marvelous, compelling movie based on a story by Alan Sillitoe, who also wrote The Loneliness Of The Long Distance Runner which became a wonderful movie in 1962 starring Tom Courtenay (see my separate review for that film).The film is a portrait of young factory worker Arthur Seaton still living at home with his parents, and working as a lathe machinist making machined metal parts for industrial use, and doing it faster and better than most other workers in the grim and gray factory where he works, an open expanse where hundreds of workers tend hundreds of work stations under a high roof in dirty and depressing circumstances.Albert Finney plays the role of ""Arthur Seaton"" brilliantly, and this movie made him a star and led to Tom Jones (1963) also starring Albert Finney, made in color, done on a big budget, and filled with production values....but also about a young man who insists on being independent and refusing to cave into demands and expectations made by inferior people who surround and supervise him. He doesn't care about his reputation, and seems to emerge from the many fights and altercations he is faced with victoriously.Set backs he endures are minor. Victories he achieves seem major.Saturday Night And Sunday Morning (1960) is about a young man led and guided by an inner force which makes him a winner, in spite of lack of mentoring, money, social position, parental support or guidance, and the mediocre opportunities and people part of his dreary world.He wants to do better than those around him, and he does.Viewers watch his progress, come to like him immediately (Albert Finney has the most infectious grin I've ever seen in the movies....the same grin shines through in Miller's Crossing [1990], a movie he stared in 30 years later where he plays a crime boss of Irish descent in America.)The movie begins with scenes showing his successful adulterous sexual relationship with ""Brenda,"" the wife (played well by Rachel Roberts) of Finney's straitlaced boss at work.As the story continues, it shows the problems which result from that, then Finney's abandonment of that girl, and finally his connection with an unusually pretty, thoughtful, reliable, attentive young girl named ""Doreen"" (played well by Shirley Anne Field) to whom he becomes engaged and plans to marry at the movie's end.In a curious way, the movie has the same ""feel good ending"" which ""B"" cowboy movies were famous for in which the hero rides off into the sunset after having set wrong things right for grateful Westerners.Alan Sillitoe is a truly great and thoughtful writer who recognized the inner strength and potential of noble young men born to low circumstances, but who are guided and delivered to good things by an inner knowledge of qualities they have and were born to use, regardless of what surrounding circumstances and bad people decree.Sillitoe's portraits of ""angry young men"" who are winners seems to favor ""nature"" in the ""nature versus nurture"" controversy and explanation of social behavior and outcomes.---------------Written by Tex Allen, SAG Actor.",5,"Saturday Night And Sunday Morning (1960) Is The Best ""Angry Young

He's a great actor, but his performance is more than individual; it's also symbolic of some anger afoot in the UK at the time--i.e., the ""angry young men"". More specifically, the combination of Finney's sex appeal and braggodocio thumbs its nose at the stereotypical image of Great Britain as the stuffy, staid upholder of propriety and good manners and lords and ladies, et cetera.His character, Arthur, is working class through and through, and it shows in every scene. He drinks and womanizes and plays tricks--mostly on older women he considers representative of stuffiness and stupidity. But he's callous himself--not stupid, but callous. This is really a slice of life movie that, more than anything else, portrays the British working class in the 1960s pretty much as they were. It's a great companion piece to another excellent British film, ""The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner"", also from the 1960s, and also featuring a young British actor making his debut, Tom Courtenay.Finney is electric in his role. What's especially good about this film is that it doesn't so much copy or emulate American movies--in departing from the image of British culture as proper, etc.--as it presents an entirely new type of film, that reveals the day-to-day lives of British workers and societal hangers-on, those who can never take anything for granted.Thumbing one's nose symbolically and cinematically here is producer Tony Richardson, who went on to direct Finney in ""Tom Jones"" (a masterpiece, I would say) and director Karel Reisz, a Polish-born Brit who went on to direct a number of other interesting films.But the biggest nose-thumber of all here is Albert Finney. The ending is deeply ironic because we can see that in short order he'll give up his nose-thumbing ways and settle down with a cute girl who has no higher ambitions, basically, than he does. Will that last? Given Arther's character, it doesn't seem likely.It's nice to see that Finney is still active in cinema.

Masterpiece is a word that is often overused, but in this case it genuinely applies.Directed by Karel Reisz in 1960, it was produced by Tony Richardson (who directed ""The Loneliness of The Long Distance Runner"") and adapted and scripted from his own novel by Alan Sillitoe. Set in Northern England, this is a world of downing pints of mild and bitter until you're paralytic drunk, red phone booths with black A/B coin boxes in them, kids getting a bag of Dolly Mixtures sweets in the corner shop, push-up packets of Sweet Afton cigarettes, busy bodies with scarves on their heads watching with malicious eyes from tenement doorways for neighbours doing anything immoral...A young Albert Finney plays defiant loudmouth Arthur Seaton who suffers the late 1950's Nottingham factory all day, because at night and at weekends, he can have his ""fun"". In his dapper suit and greased-back hair, Arthur is busy juggling another man's wife, drinking and betting. Finney isn't just good in the part, he's magnificent - he inhabits every scene like a panther about to pounce - like the world owes him a favour and his character Arthur clearly believes it does (his anthem above is spoken in the opening credits as he wipes his hands in a rag by the machine-tool lathe).Having said that, watching the movie again, you're more struck by the women whose parts were cutting edge for the time - given real meat to work with. Shirley Ann Field isn't just a pretty face as Doreen the girl who makes hairnets and lives at home with her mum; she adds a rare intelligence and class to the movie. Hylda Baker is excellent as the convivial Aunt Ada who thinks Arthur is a lovely boy, but it's Rachel Roberts as the smitten wife who nicks the film - she is needy one moment, steel the next - then towards the end, she's just beaten and broken as she realizes Arthur's heart is going somewhere else - permanently.Johnny Dankworth's jazz soundtrack is deceptive - it seems like fun, but mostly it acts as an almost sly and sinister backdrop - happy tunes for people with nowhere to go - for the rest of their lives... It's very, very effective.But your eyes keep coming back to the print - apart from a few lines in the opening shot of the noisy factory floor, the stark black and white footage is consistently fantastic - you can see Rachel's face blusher, Finney's sweat in the pub as he watches a war-veteran drown his sorrow in beer (Peter Sallis - the voice of Wallace in Wallace & Gromit - has a bit part in that scene) even feel the soft texture of Doreen's cashmere cardigans...a stunning restoration job done from start to finish.The 4 extras are a mixed bag of the great and the disappointing:1. A commentary for the duration of the film, which you can have On or Off.2. There's an extract of an interview with Albert Finney taped in 1982 at the National Film Theatre (hosted by Michael Billington), which is accompanied by stills from the film. It's witty and informative in some ways, but criminally short at about 6 minutes. Being the main star, it's very disappointing to not hear more from him. Far better is...3. An interview with Shirley Ann Field, which is superlative. She reminisces about each of the actors, her naivety at the time of filming, how groundbreaking the subject matter was - and of course from the stills - you get to see how beautiful she was and still is - a class act - much like Finney himself.4. Best, however, is ""We Are The Lambeth Boys"", a documentary film about youths at work and play. It centres on the ""Alford House Youth Club"" and like the film is fully restored too. It uses the same Woodfall film team - Reisz as Director, Walter Lassally the camerman and even has Johnny Dankworth's jazzy music. It's a fascinating and lengthy insight into a world of British youth that is gone forever.""Saturday Night And Sunday Morning"" is a balls-to-the-wall triumph on Blu Ray - it's just such a shame that the mighty Albert Finney didn't get more involved - it would have been such sweet icing to an already great piece of cake.Recommended - big time.PS: the BFI have also done BLU RAYS of ""The Loneliness Of The Long Distance Runner"" (see REVIEW) and an astonishing restoration of Stanley Baker's ""Zulu"" and Michael Caine's ""The Italian Job"" (see UK review)....they're playable on all region BR

681194,A1SVXJZ3386U2D,B00005S8KV,Randy Keehn,"[5, 6]","I have seen a few of the ""angry young Brit"" movies of the late 50's and early 60's lately.  ""This Sporting Life"", ""Look Back in Anger"", and ""Saturday Night and Sunday Morning"" leave a picture of a society that offers little except a tedious life with limited rewards.  The Richard Harris character in ""This Sporting Life"" at least had an opportunity to reach beyond but he was ultimately reminded where he belonged.  These movies left me wondering why British life in that era seemed so incredibly boring while in America things were really hopping.  The Beatles changed all that but then watching ""The Fully Monty"" gave me the impression that the deadend life had returned.It's hard to get excited about all this dreariness but I'm certain that the directors had a point to make.  Maybe it was a Dickensian version of the ""youth will be served"" motto.  The anger, the fighting, the drinking, the love/hate relationships with women all portrayed a life without joy.  Personally, I thought that ""Saturday Night and Sunday Morning"" was the best of the lot.  Although Albert Finney might be a slight notch below Richards Burton and Harris, I felt his was the more compelling character; lost, aimless, but not willing to take it sitting down.  He seemed to care for no one but himself (a common trait of the leading men in these movies) and was ready to sacrifice just about anybody to keep his life at least somewhat enjoyable.  Burton was just plain angry and Harris was obsessed with his game but Finney used the people around him as pawns for his own entertainment.  One of those individuals was played by Rachel Roberts who played the same sort of role in ""This Sporting Life"".Some movies make you happy and some make you think.  This limited genre of film seems to make you think you'd be happy to watch something else instead.  Yet there is the life that must be lived in a society that has predetermined where you belong.  These movies may impress many a viewer and I have to admit that the acting and directing is superb in all three of the movies I cited from that era.  However, I came away from each one gladder than before that I spent those years in Middle America rather than Great Britain.",4,Working Class Zero,1175040000,"03 28, 2007",2007,2201,"['have', 'seen', 'few', 'angry', 'young', 'Brit', 'movies', 'late', '50', 'early', '60', 'lately', 'Sporting', 'Life', 'Look', 'Back', 'Anger', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Sunday', 'Morning', 'leave', 'picture', 'society', 'little', 'tedious', 'life', 'limited', 'rewards', 'Richard', 'Harris', 'character', 'Sporting', 'Life', 'least', 'had', 'opportunity', 'reach', 'was', 'ultimately', 'reminded', 'where', 'belonged', 'movies', 'left', 'wondering', 'why', 'British', 'life', 'era', 'seemed', 'so', 'incredibly', 'boring', 'America', 'things', 'were', 'really', 'hopping', 'Beatles', 'changed', 'then', 'watching', 'Fully', 'Monty', 'gave', 'impression', 'deadend', 'life', 'had', 'returned.It', 'hard', 'get', 'excited', 'dreariness', ""'m"", 'certain', 'directors', 'had', 'point', 'make', 'Maybe', 'was', 'Dickensian', 'version', 'youth', 'will', 'be', 'served', 'motto', 'anger', 'fighting', 'drinking', 'love/hate', 'relationships', 'women', 'portrayed', 'life', 'joy', 'Personally', 'thought', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Sunday', 'Morning', 'was', 'best', 'lot', 'Albert', 'Finney', 'might', 'be', 'slight', 'notch', 'Richards', 'Burton', 'Harris', 'felt', 'was', 'more', 'compelling', 'character', 'lost', 'aimless', 'not', 'willing', 'take', 'sitting', 'down', 'seemed', 'care', 'one', 'common', 'trait', 'leading', 'men', 'movies', 'was', 'ready', 'sacrifice', 'just', 'anybody', 'keep', 'life', 'least', 'somewhat', 'enjoyable', 'Burton', 'was', 'just', 'plain', 'angry', 'Harris', 'was', 'obsessed', 'game', 'Finney', 'used', 'people', 'around', 'pawns', 'own', 'entertainment', 'One', 'individuals', 'was', 'played', 'Rachel', 'Roberts', 'who', 'played', 'same', 'sort', 'role', 'Sporting', 'Life', '.Some', 'movies', 'make', 'happy', 'make', 'think', 'limited', 'genre', 'film', 'make', 'think', ""'d"", 'be', 'happy', 'watch', 'something', 'else', 'instead', 'life', 'must', 'be', 'lived', 'society', 'predetermined', 'where', 'belong', 'movies', 'may', 'impress', 'many', 'viewer', 'have', 'admit', 'acting', 'directing', 'superb', 'three', 'movies', 'cited', 'era', 'However', 'came', 'away', 'one', 'gladder', 'spent', 'years', 'Middle', 'America', 'rather', 'Great', 'Britain']",N/A
681195,A26JGAM6GZMM4V,B00005S8KV,Robert Morris,"[43, 43]","Throughout the 1950s, a group of young British writers were referred to as ""angry young men"" because, in their novels and plays, they excoriated what they perceived to be the dominant materialistic values of their society following World War Two. They included playwrights John Osborne and Kingsley Amis and novelists John Braine, John Wain, and Alan Silitoe. This film is based on Silitoe's novel (same title) in which he focuses on Arthur Seaton (brilliantly portrayed by Albert Finney) who endures working in a factory all week so that he can afford to drink and chase women on Saturday evening. He lives (if that's the word) day-to-day, insisting ""All I want is a good time. The rest is propaganda."" Arthur is intelligent enough to know how to indulge his vices but lacks the wisdom to understand that he is drinking and wenching away what few prospects he has to improve his situation. It is unclear (at least to me) whether or not Arthur really wishes to do so. While continuing an affair with Brenda (Rachel Roberts), the bored and restless wife of his foreman/supervisor Jack (Bryan Pringle), Albert also becomes involved with Doreen Gretton (Shirley Ann Field) whose own ambitions seem limited to getting married and starting a family. Revealing to me is the fact that neither Arthur nor Brenda seems especially concerned about, much less rebellious against the limits imposed on them within their class-based industrial society.Suffocation is one of the recurring themes in James Joyce's novels and short stories. I was reminded of that recently as I again observed Arthur's self-indulgent hedonism, indifference to the feelings of others, and callous betrayal of what little he has going for him. Sooner than he realizes, there will be only quiet evenings at home on Saturday. As for his Sundays, perhaps (just perhaps) they will include a moment when he wonders where his youth went as he wearily looks ahead to another dreary week in the local factory.

681197,A3RNP5X8ZGZIEI,B00005S8KV,Stephanie De Pue,"[4, 4]","""Saturday Night and Sunday Morning,"" (1960) is another black and white, taut 89 minute, British classic, a raw melodrama.  It tells the story of a rebellious, hard-working, hard-living factory worker in gritty Nottingham, in the North of England, who is trying to juggle relationships with two women, one of them married to another man, but pregnant with the protagonist's child.  It was directed by the talented Karel Reisz (The French Lieutenant's Woman); British novelist/playwright Alan Sillitoe (The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner) wrote the screenplay, based on his own semi-autobiographical book.Its protagonist, Arthur Seaton, played by a young, handsome and magnetic Albert Finney,(Tom Jones (1963)) has long been considered by critics as an exemplary working class ""angry young man"" of the 1960s, the decade in which England would later begin to swing.  Up until that time, it had been rare even for an English film to explore working class life, let alone show people as unhappy with it, but Sillitoe can certainly be considered a founding father of the angry young man school of writers.  Seaton works hard at his bench all week for a measly paycheck at a mindless job in a dirty and dangerous factory.  Come Saturday night, he likes to go out to the pub for loud and rowdy fun, accompanied by his girlfriend of the moment, Brenda, played by the forceful Rachel Roberts (This Sporting Life (The Criterion Collection)).  Unfortunately, she does happen to be married to one of Seaton's co-workers, Jack, played by Bryan Pringle.  Then Seaton sets his eyes on the gorgeous young Doreen, played by the gorgeous young Shirley Anne Field (Hear My Song [VHS],Alfie). All concerned know Brenda's day is done; however, she announces she is pregnant by Seaton, and he agrees to help her get an abortion.  Comic spear carriers Norman Rossington and Colin Blakely also appear. Johnny Dankworth contributed the memorable jazz score.In the British theater, the angry young man revolt was known as producing ""kitchen sink drama."" As movies took up the cry, it was known as ""free cinema,"" an attempt by young filmmakers to break away from the usual suspects.  This film was a big hit in its time.Frankly, I find the whole concept of the ""angry young man"" dated, but this film is still remarkably fresh.  I find Seaton not nearly angry enough, nor, unhappily, well-enough educated to know why he should be.  His place of work is deafeningly noisy, almost blindingly smoky; the air is obviously full of toxins.  There is clearly no ventilation or air conditioning.  There seems to be only a dirt floor, on which rats and cats run.  In fact, it's a perfect example of the kind of factory that British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, reviled by the working class, forced to either close or remodel, as it could never compete in the world market.  I should think the working class owes her some gratitude for that.Furthermore, Seaton lives with his parents in the classic two up, two down cottage, outhouse in the rear, hard by the factory, so he, and everyone else, is breathing its toxins day and night.  Critics have long held that Seaton gives up his rebellion when he agrees with Doreen that they will buy a new house, with an interior bathroom, in what was then considered a suburb of the town.

681198,A3H4EV4UMST3HV,B00005S8KV,steve b,"[28, 29]","Saturday Night and Sunday Morning is one of a group of so called 'kitchen sink dramas' which dominated British cinema in the early sixties. What these films brought to the screen for the first time were realistic portrails of British and in particular English working class life. This to my mind was the golden age of British film making with pictures like, This Sporting Life, Billy Liar, A Kind of Loving, Alfie, Up the Junction and Kess showing ordinary people struggling to make the best of their lot. This mood was also reflected on British TV with shows like Z Cars, Play for Today and even the early Coronation Street.The best of this genre is Saturday Night and Sunday Morning. One thing most of these films have in common is that the hero trys to escape the limitation of his working class background. In A Kind of Loving the hero escapes into music and the middle class, In Kes, Billy Kasper escapes his hopeless situation by training and flying his hawk. In this film however Arthur Seaton (Albert Finney) sees no point in getting out. All he wants from life is to earn enough money to spend his weekends drinking and chasing women. Not that Arthur is unintelligent he just sees everything in life, politics, ambition and married life as phoney. Arthur wants to remain free of society's demand to comform either to marriage or to moving on and 'bettering himself'Rachel Roberts and Shirley Ann Fields give great performances as Arthur's love or rather sex interest and Albert Finney is perfect as the cynical Arthur Seaton. The film ends with Arthur accepting marriage to Doreen (Fields) but telling her not to expect him to confirm all the time ( It will not be the last stone I will throw.)Saturday Night and Sunday Morning captures a certain time and place and for any American viewers who want to know, is it an  accurate a portrail of working class sixties England? I can assure them that it is.Apart from those films about Britain's Asian communities, no British film today shows the British working class with making out that all it contains are thieves, druggies and gangsters.The only exception being Mike Leigh's work.Saturday Night and Sunday Morning is a gem.

He is trapped in a 'nowhere' job, in a work and home enviroment he hates.  He is in rebellion, but his rebellion leads nowhere.

681200,AY8WZDYR79GFV,B00005S8KV,Yasha Banana,"[6, 16]","This is a rather *tedious* movie.Naturalist filmmaking, except in rare cases (e.g., Jules Dassen's ""Naked City,"" Stankey Kubrick's ""The Killing"") is often just so much lifeless, documentary-style camera-pointing.Also, the extensive use of dubbing in these movies, as opposed to live-sound, renders the audience ""once-removed"" from the feelings expressed in an actor's voice; an actor's voice being perhaps his most important attribute.OK, Albert Finney is a great actor, no question about that.  But not in this movie.As for the story, it's flat, predictable, one-dimensional.  And those are its good points.  (Rim shot -- ba-da bing-bing!)For example, for a movie that's supposed to address the issue of social classes, what does this movie say other than ""the guy's stuck in a rut""?  Ok, but how can he escape?  This question is never explored.  Indeed, the ending is a TINA ending -- ""There Is No Alternative"" -- a decidedly right-wing, reactionary point of view.What dialectic might be applied to the social, political and economic forces the movie attempts to portray?  We're never given a clue.Industry, automation, alienation, anomie, working class grit and grime; they're all here; but no politics, no political context, no meaningful sociological insights.In what way does this movie speak to the human condition?  Its trite, cop-out, play-it-safe ending is as flat as the movie itself.Simply saying: ""Behold, the working class!"" doesn't give a movie social or political meaning.  Compare this movie to, for example, ""Norma Rae.""  ""Norma Rae"" is a complete, in-her-world, in-her-class character.  As is her husband, her father, her children, her co-workers, the union rep she meets up with.  This is what the ""Norma Rae"" filmmakers succeed in doing.  By contrast, such ""contextual political/interpersonal structure"" is completely lacking in ""Saturday Night Sunday Morning.""  As a movie, it's technically  sloppy; as a story, it's all too predictable.Yes, of course, the movie was, in its time, ""quite different"" from what preceded it; and no doubt at the time it was quite shocking and upsetting to certain middle class expectations.  But so what?  In hindsight, it's  amateurish, sophomoric.Unlike Jesse James or Willie Sutton, it doesn't hold up.  (Did you see what I did there? ... Jesse James, Willie Sutton. ... A little holdup humor.  I gotta million of 'em.)One can easily find much better class-conscious movie.  ""The Citadel,"" for example, starring Robert Donat and Ralph (not Tony) Richardson.""The Citadel"" is a movie that, while not shot out in the street, with a jerky, undisciplined camera, nevertheless says more about class consciousness in British society in one minute than this movie does in its entirety.Sometimes going into the street is just ... going into the street.So ""Saturday Night Sunday Morning"" was shot on the street (with lots of dubbed sound effects), in a factory (with lots of dubbed noise), in a real, live pub (with lots of dubbed revelry), between characters (with  lots of dubbed dialogue).  But so what?  WHAT DID THE BLOODY MOVIE HAVE TO SAY?!!  If you're making a movie about the working class, shouldn't the movie have an ideological point of view?  (A revolutionary idea, I know, but there you have it.)Note: ""Oh-wow-dig-the-working class"" is NOT an ideology.If a film aspires to art, shouldn't it have something to say about the human condition?  Its sociological pretenses notwithstanding, this film has absolutely nothing to say about the social, political and economic forces that profoundly affect individuals and the times they live in.",2,Predictable and pretentious.
