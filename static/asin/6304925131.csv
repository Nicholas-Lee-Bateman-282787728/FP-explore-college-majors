439696,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,6304925131,Acute Observer,"[0, 0]","This is a story about a young new lawyer in a southern town in Tennessee. He takes the case of a young man who is dying of leukemia because his private insurance company refused treatment (a bone marrow transplant). This dramatic story tells how a powerful established law fiem can use tricks like wiretapping or bugging to sabotage a legal challenge. Their son dies, the parents continue the suit. [The film shows little of the personal lives of the people in this story.]Matt Damon, the young lawyer, does all he can to gather the information needed to win his case against the privately owned insurance company. Why did a claims examiner suddenly ""resign""? Was she sickened by her work in the insurance company? [Alcoholism just doesn't happen, its an industrial disease caused by corporations.] Jon Voight, the power in the corporation's law firm, shows his acting skills in the accented speech of that area. [All speakers of English have an accent, you don't notice your own.] The facts brought out in the dramatic trial result in a verdict for the plaintiff, plus $50 million in punitive damages. Is this too good to be true?The private insurance company preys upon the working poor by using door-to-door salesmen to sell policies. These high costs drain money from the premiums. Are they only selling ""peace of mind""? Will this private insurance company declare bankruptcy to get out of paying? Was the owner looting the firm? Was it all a scam to oppress working people and cheat them out of needed health care? Some may claim this is only a work of fiction, but these things will happen as long as we do not have government-run health insurance that is well-managed and affordable to avoid a tragedy like this. [Read the book ""A Civil Action"" for facts.]You know what happened in the financial industry since the New Deal regulations were abolished over the last thirty years. [Could this story happen in Canada or England?] John Grisham wrote the novel ""A Runaway Jury"" that was changed by Hollywood and turned into a big flop.

439697,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,6304925131,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[5, 13]","John Grisham has proven himself to be the literary lawyer.  His books open the courtrooms to the masses, and allow the underdog to rule the day.  With that said, not every Grisham novel is best told in the cinematic language.  From ""The Firm"" to ""A Time to Kill"" and now to ""The Rainmaker"" directors and studios have tried to bring the elaborately well written stories to the screen with the same panache and excitement that is in the binded world - and yet every time, they fail.  The films are entertaining, but after one viewing - the ability to view a repeat performance has lost momentum.  Recently, ""The Rainmaker"" came across my DVD player, and I was forced to endure a repetitive story, one-dimensional characters, and a predictable ending that left me gasping for some originality.  One must admit that Francis Ford Coppola does attempt to bring a level of authenticity to the screen, but it is the mediocre Matt Damon and the always odd Danny DeVito that force this film to flounder.  Also, condensing a 443-page book into just over two hours is difficult.  There is quite a bit lost within the translation, and ""The Rainmaker"" is no exception.  From the lacking cardboard-esque relationship between Damon and Claire Danes all the way to the less-than-exciting courtroom element, ""The Rainmaker"" struggles to hold on, and after 12 years, it just doesn't remain as pivotal as it once, perhaps, was.Re-watching this film for the first time in ten years, I wasn't expecting Oscar-caliber performances, nor was I walking in with great unrealistic hopes - which may be the reason it didn't further my desire to watch more Grisham adaptations.  All I wanted from this film was an enjoyable two hours, but even that was a struggle.  The beginning struggle with ""The Rainmaker"" comes from Coppola's choice of pacing.  There is quite a bit of down time with this film, where we (as audience members) are merely watching small, unimportant character development that led nowhere.  Damon cutting grass, hanging out in a hospital, asleep at his desk, or late for his most important case ever - are all within this film, but edited stronger - leaving these small unneeded bits out - would have tightened this story further.  Coppola feels as if he has more information than this film can process within the time allowed.  This hurts not only the film as a whole, but the individual parts (i.e. the characters, the tone, and the intended drama) as well.  Because the editing was loose, we are lost when Damon heads to help his questionable love interest Claire Danes.  We are lost as to the direction of Damon's relationship with ""Bruiser"".  We are lost as to the focus of DeVito's character, who represents himself as smarter than Coppola gives him credit for.  So, to add to the mix of disheveled actors this plot that fails because of the lack of editing and character development, we have a sloppy film that is liked by too many.Plot.  Aristotle said ""plot matters"", and it should be believed that those involved with ""The Rainmaker"" should have paid further attention to this decree.  ""The Rainmaker"" is a film about a newbie lawyer taking his first big case which is in essence the simplistic story of big business versus the little poverty of America.  It is a strong beginning, but we loose focus when we add other elements that are never fully explained.  Is Danes really in love with Damon who is portrayed as someone merely eager to help her, not fall in love?  How influential was ""Bruiser"" to Damon's upbringing as a lawyer?  Did anyone else believe that when Danny Glover was introduced as the sympathetic judge that this case was predetermined?  Wouldn't anyone notice DeVito wasn't a lawyer - as smart as the defense was?  Voight was slimy, but was it just his accent that made him that way?  Then, we have the utterly realistic, but completely misplaced ending that felt cheap instead of honest.  There was supposed to be emotion from the family who suffered the loss, but we are left with such little time dedicated to either side, that we just feel bored.  Not a tear was struck with the emotion pulled out at the end, and I think that is an indication of how poorly Coppola directed this film.Overall, ""The Rainmaker"" leaves you with further disappointment than originally thought.  A courtroom drama is always worth at least one slick move, at least one important cameo, and one highly emotional scene that leaves you with the impression of how good these lawyers and genre's can be.  ""The Rainmaker"" had none of these.  Scaling this film among those like ""A Few Good Men"" or even Grisham's ""The Firm"", it falls well below.  If you walk in with no expectations, than perhaps this film will uplift your spirits.  Alas, for me - there was just a lacking plot, a terrible edit, and wafer-esque characters that hurt the determined tone of this film.  It was an embarrassing outing for Coppola as a director, but also the courtroom drama genre.  There are better films that fit the bill out there, avoid this one.Grade: ** out of *****",1,Just pray you don't get Jury Duty here...,1251590400,"08 30, 2009",2009,5047,"['John', 'Grisham', 'proven',

439704,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6304925131,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","A film like `The Rainmaker' doesn't really do anything that other films in this genre don't.  It isn't special and it certainly isn't a great movie.  I come from a bias viewpoint (not bias in a good way) since these legal courtroom thrillers don't often excite me past a performance or two.That said, `The Rainmaker' works better than it should thanks to the talent involved, both behind and in front of the camera.  Francis Ford Coppola is one of the greatest filmmakers of any time, and it has been sad to see his obvious fall from grace.  He is a conundrum of sorts when you consider the fact that he produces epic masterpieces like `Apocalypse Now' and then produces an airy romantic comedy like `Peggy Sue Got Married'.  Still, he has remained relevant until the aughts, where his star officially fell.  Even back in 1997, his take on `The Rainmaker' could be seen as a stroke of relevance since the courtroom genre, and John Grisham in general, was considered a hot commodity at the time.  While the clich&eacute;s and generalizations do abound here (Grisham has never been the most creative of writers), Coppola handles them like a pro and creates a film that stands up to all of its strengths in a respectable way.Calling the film respectable isn't necessarily calling it good, but respectable is better than embarrassing.  That respectability can also read as a tad drag or boring (is it too straightforward for its own good) but it can also be seen as a strength by some.The cast is also on point, which helps propel this film forward.  It carved out Damon's star persona, which was coming into full effect thanks to the same years offering of `Good Will Hunting'.  The supporting cast is even richer here, with a devilish John Voight, a scruffy and engaging Danny DeVito and a brilliant (yes, I said it) Claire Danes.  I wish it were a tad more fulfilling, plot wise.  I find it too familiar and too conventional, but that is the nature of the beast and thus why I never really took to the genre (someone needs to redefine this in a way that feels fresh and exciting).  Still, if you gravitate towards standard legal thrillers or find them engaging in their obvious regurgitation of one another, you can't really go wrong with this choice.It isn't as brazen or as thrilling as `The Firm' (one of the best in the genre, by a long shot) but it is uniformly correct, which has to account for something.",3,"It's perfectly standard, if that is what you are looking for...",1339718400,"06 15, 2012",2012,2410,"['film', 'Rainmaker', ""n't"", 'really', 'do', 'anything', 'other', 'films', 'genre', 'do', ""n't"", ""n't"", 'special', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'great', 'movie', 'come', 'bias', 'viewpoint', 'not', 'bias', 'good', 'way', 'legal', 'courtroom', 'thrillers', 'do', ""n't"", 'often', 'excite', 'performance', 'two.That', 'said', 'Rainmaker', 'works', 'better', 'should', 'thanks', 'talent', 'involved', 'front', 'camera', 'Francis', 'Ford', 'Coppola', 'one', 'greatest', 'filmmakers', 'time', 'been', 'sad', 'see', 'obvious', 'fall', 'grace', 'conundrum', 'sorts', 'when', 'consider', 'fact', 'epic', 'masterpieces', 'Apocalypse', 'Now', 'then', 'airy', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'Peggy', 'Sue', 'Got', 'Married', 'Still', 'remained', 'relevant', 'aughts', 'where', 'star', 'officially', 'fell', 'Even', 'back', '1997', 'take', 'Rainmaker', 'could', 'be', 'seen', 'stroke', 'relevance', 'courtroom', 'genre', 'John', 'Grisham', 'general', 'was', 'considered', 'hot', 'commodity', 'time', 'clich', 'eacute', 'generalizations', 'do', 'abound', 'here', 'Grisham', 'never', 'been', 'most', 'creative', 'writers', 'Coppola', 'pro', 'film', 'up', 'strengths', 'respectable', 'way.Calling', 'film', 'respectable', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'calling', 'good', 'respectable', 'better', 'embarrassing', 'respectability', 'can', 'also', 'read', 'tad', 'drag', 'boring', 'too', 'straightforward', 'own', 'good', 'can', 'also', 'be', 'seen', 'strength', 'some.The', 'cast', 'also', 'point', 'propel', 'film', 'forward', 'carved', 'out', 'Damon', 'star', 'persona', 'was', 'coming', 'full', 'effect', 'thanks', 'same', 'years', 'offering', 'Good', 'Will', 'Hunting', 'supporting', 'cast', 'even', 'richer', 'here', 'devilish', 'John', 'Voight', 'scruffy', 'engaging', 'Danny', 'DeVito', 'brilliant', 'yes', 'said', 'Claire', 'Danes', 'wish', 'were', 'tad', 'more', 'fulfilling', 'plot', 'wise', 'find', 'too', 'familiar', 'too', 'conventional', 'nature', 'beast', 'thus', 'why', 'never', 'really', 'took', 'genre', 'someone', 'redefine', 'way', 'fresh', 'exciting', 'Still', 'gravitate', 'towards', 'standard', 'legal', 'thrillers', 'find', 'engaging', 'obvious', 'regurgitation', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'go', 'wrong', 'choice.It', ""n't"", 'brazen', 'as', 'thrilling', 'Firm', 'one', 'best', 'genre', 'long', 'shot', 'uniformly', 'correct', 'account', 'something']",N/A

This current baseball bat thrashing has put Kelly in the hospital, yet she won't divorce Cliff as he's threatened to kill her if she tries.Finally, there's Donny Ray Black (Whitworth). He desperately needs an operation but the insurance company refuses to pay for it. Donny's parents (Place and West) don't have the resources to fight this corporation, but Rudy's willing to help in any way he can. Rudy has just passed the bar exam but is unlicensed when he goes into court on Donny's behalf. An enraged Judge Hale (Stockwell) orders Rudy out of his courtroom until he has his credentials, but the insurance company's high-priced attorney, Leo Drummond (Voight) appeals to allow Rudy to stay on and Hale obliges by swearing the young man in. Of course Drummond has an ulterior motive: to teach a rookie lawyer not to take on the best.Judge Kippler (Glover) takes over when Hale has a fatal coronary, and unlike Hale, this magistrate is not friendly to Drummond.(NOTE: Glover has a significant role yet he receives no screen credit.)THE RAINMAKER is an excellent film, Grisham's favorite screen adapation, and is highly recommended.",4,"""Sworn in by a fool and vouched for by a scoundrel.

The title has nothing to do with magic or dowsing rods.Rudy Baylor (Matt Damon) is a hot young lawyer with what may be a really big case. But he's up against the suits in a large and respectable firm that represent the insurance company that denied the medical claim of a young man who is now dying as a result. What can he possibly do against such big guns?But Rudy has an ace in the hole in the form of a self-styled ""paralawyer"" (the proper term is paralegal, but he considers himself almost a lawyer, no matter how many times he has failed the bar exam) played to perfection by Danny DeVito. Now I worked for insurance defense lawyers for 16 years, and my inclination is to root for them against the ambulance-chasing plaintiffs' attorneys. So with all my prejudices intact, I found myself rooting for Rudy and Deck the paralawyer, in spite of the huge demand in punitive damages. I know punies, as they are called, are normally a negotiating ploy when the plaintiff's attorney has no intention of going to trial. Not here. Rudy has uncovered facts which make the punies fully justified. But how does he get it admitted into evidence past an army of experienced defense attorneys? How will he explain the technical details to a jury of ordinary folk? Pay close attention: it's all worth it.They go to trial, and I guess it's no big surprise that they win.

And the dialogue crackles while the actors clearly seem to relish their roles. DeVito is a lot of fun as the slightly disreputable legal aid with a heart of gold while Voight is at his slimy best. Claire Daines is solid enough, and Damon - in one of his first big roles - displays the confidence and skill that have since made him so good.

It's just great storytelling, regardless.The film features a deep cast and one that puts on a great displaying acting, from the lead ""good guy"" Matt Damon to the lead ""bad guy"" Jon Voight to all the performers somewhere in the middle, headed by ambulance chaser Danny DeVito.It's not a believable story at all - a rookie lawyer fresh out of school outsmarting a team of proved veterans with big money backing them - but it makes for a good story. Everyone likes to root for David against Goliath, which is what this turns out to be. Just one example, by the way, of the political correctness in here: the kid lawyer's hopes of a fair trial only become reality after the older, obviously-corrupt white judge suddenly dies and is replaced by Harvard- educated black judge (Danny Glover, of all people). Now, as it's quickly demonstrated in the film, a man of Liberal sensibilities will be bring fairness and justice to this case!The story is not flattering to lawyers, but it's not all-condemning either. It's pretty balanced in that regard. There's not much profanity, either. Damon does very well in this choice role and once again demonstrates why he was considered one of the best in the crop of today's younger actors back in this mid-to-late `90s period.It helps that he portrays an extremely likable character, who not only sticks up for a poor, neglected family against a big, wealthy corporation but rescues a sweet woman (Clarie Danes) from her physically-abusive husband at the same time! Wow, he does it all: SuperLawyer!Danes is very appealing as the battered wife who winds up being romanced by Damon. That part of the film is not distracting, but a nice break from the legalese of the main story. It helps make the movie even more involving.

439738,A27CFNHYZG6WS8,6304925131,darragh o'donoghue,"[1, 2]","'The Rain Maker' is Coppola's most engaging film in years.  It is a curiously inert one - the plot is an extended take on a hundred episodes of 'Quincy', so there is little suspense; there is no character development, each character almost exactly the same finishing as beginning, give or take a few bruises.  Matt Damon is so stolid, he could only be a man of unimpeachable integrity, a Gregory Peck for the new millenium in the body of Rock Hudson.  There is absolutely no conflict for the audience - the bad guys are slickly, callously, cynically evil, with every sordid revelation of their business practice only confirming this: they are all caricatures, albeit enjoyable ones.  The good guys are almost angelic.  There's nothing wrong with al this - it's nice, in these exhaustingly globalising times, to assert the values of 'little people' against monstrous corporations, even if we have to get all Capra-sentimental to do it, even if we've to deny humanity and truth.So why, in spite of all this, is 'Rain' so enjoyable?  Is it the cast of practised professionals doing their thing?  Partly, if you like your crime dramas spliced with 'Around the World in 80 Days'.  Is it Coppola's uncharacteristically relaxed storytelling, giving each scene space without imposing heavy meaning on it, pushing the story along at a quick pace, emphasising the comic and the playful?  Definitely.But there's more.  Despite its professional proficiency, 'Rain' is not just an anonymous Coppola director-for-hire assignment.  There are shades of 'the Godfather' in the pastiche-Gordon Willis murky cinematography, the emphasis on (alternative) 'family' values over the threats of the outside world, and the use of the crime genre to explore the dark centre of American corporate, legal and governmental power.But the Coppola film 'Rain' most resembles is 'Apocalypse Now', albeit in diluted form.  Like Willard, Rudy tells his own story, trying to control messy experience.  He is less honest than Willard, and winds up looking like the beacon of integrity he sees himself as, full of sententious self-importance.  But Coppola emphasises the Southern Gothic inherent in Grisham's narrative.  The principle of Gothic is opposed to that of Law and Reason, and one of the best scenes here shows the signing of a legal document, which makes Rudy look like an exploiter, turn into something from horror, a nosebleed, disintegration of the body, blood all over the document.The crucial scene - where Rudy fights against the wife-beating husband of the woman he loves - is deeply shocking, reason and legality giving way to violence and desire, as he finds a cowardly way to get the girl bypassing a lengthy legal process.  It's the old Lawrence adage about American literature, the disparity between the teller and the tale, making 'Rain' infinitely more fascinating than its bland courtroom surface.",3,One of Coppola's cannier works.,1000339200,"09 13, 2001",2001,2885,"['Rain', 'Maker', 'Coppola', 'most', 'engaging', 'film', 'years', 'curiously', 'inert', 'one', 'plot', 'extended', 'take', 'hundred', 'episodes', ""'Quincy"", 'little', 'suspense', 'character', 'development', 'character', 'almost', 'exactly', 'same', 'finishing', 'beginning', 'give', 'take', 'few', 'bruises', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'so', 'stolid', 'could', 'only', 'be', 'man', 'unimpeachable', 'integrity', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'new', 'millenium', 'body', 'Rock', 'Hudson', 'absolutely', 'conflict', 'audience', 'bad', 'guys', 'are', 'slickly', 'callously', 'cynically', 'evil', 'sordid', 'revelation', 'business', 'practice', 'only', 'confirming', 'are', 'caricatures', 'enjoyable', 'ones', 'good', 'guys', 'are', 'almost', 'angelic', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'al', 'nice', 'exhaustingly', 'globalising', 'times', 'assert', 'values', ""'little"", 'people', 'monstrous', 'corporations', 'even', 'have', 'get', 'Capra-sentimental', 'do', 'even', ""'ve"", 'deny', 'humanity', 'truth.So', 'why', 'spite', ""'Rain"", 'so', 'enjoyable', 'cast', 'practised', 'professionals', 'doing', 'thing', 'Partly', 'like', 'crime', 'dramas', 'spliced', 'World', '80', 'Days', 'Coppola', 'uncharacteristically', 'relaxed', 'storytelling', 'giving', 'scene', 'space', 'imposing', 'heavy', 'meaning', 'pushing', 'story', 'along', 'quick', 'pace', 'emphasising', 'comic', 'playful', 'Definitely.But', 'more', 'professional', 'proficiency', 'not', 'just', 'anonymous', 'Coppola', 'director-for-hire', 'assignment', 'are', 'shades', ""'the"", 'Godfather', 'pastiche-Gordon', 'Willis', 'murky', 'cinematography', 'emphasis', 'alternative', ""'family"", 'values', 'threats', 'outside', 'world', 'use', 'crime', 'genre', 'explore', 'dark', 'centre', 'American', 'corporate', 'legal', 'governmental', 'power.But', 'Coppola', 'film', 'most', 'resembles', ""'Apocalypse"", 'Now', 'diluted', 'form', 'Willard', 'Rudy', 'own', 'story', 'trying', 'control', 'messy', 'experience', 'less', 'honest', 'Willard', 'up', 'looking', 'beacon', 'integrity', 'full', 'sententious', 'self-importance', 'Coppola', 'Southern', 'Gothic', 'inherent', 'Grisham', 'narrative', 'principle', 'Gothic', 'opposed', 'Law', 'Reason', 'one', 'best', 'scenes', 'here', 'signing', 'legal', 'document', 'Rudy', 'look', 'exploiter', 'turn', 'something', 'horror', 'nosebleed', 'disintegration', 'body', 'blood', 'document.The', 'crucial', 'scene', 'where', 'Rudy', 'fights', 'wife-beating', 'husband', 'woman', 'deeply', 'shocking', 'reason', 'legality', 'giving', 'way', 'violence', 'desire', 'cowardly', 'way', 'get', 'girl', 'bypassing', 'lengthy', 'legal', 'process', 'old', 'Lawrence', 'adage', 'American', 'literature', 'disparity', 'teller', 'tale', 'making', 'infinitely', 'more', 'fascinating', 'bland', 'courtroom', 'surface']",N/A

Mikels ""It's always Happy Hour here""","[0, 0]","I did not realize THE RAINMAKER was released a few weeks before the sensationalGood Will Hunting, which I assumed was Matt Damon's introduction to the movie-going public.  That was quite the surprise, but I digress.  Playing attorney Rudy Baylor, Damon is solid and believable as a naive, wet-behind-the-ears officer of the court willing to take on a formidable insurance company for refusing to cover the costs of a procedure that might have saved the life of a young man dying of leukemia.  Furthermore, Damon is aided by a crafty paralegal (Danny DeVito) not afraid to push the ethical envelope in order to gain an advantage over an opponent.  Add on top of that the rescue, and budding romance, of a young, physically abused wife (Claire Danes), and director Francis Ford Coppola's plate is full as he delivers his version of the John Grisham novel.Yet as the title to this review suggests, there are no eye-opening twists, or turns, or surprises in this courtroom thriller; furthermore, the insurance company's high-priced legal team is led by a smug, condescending attorney (Jon Voight is fantastic), and the trial is presided over by a conservative, defendant-loving judge (Dean Stockwell).  Predictably young Rudy is on over his head, he's thwarted at every attempt to introduce evidence or file for discovery or deliver a witness, and he encounters setback after setback.  Only after the testimony of a former insurance company employee, who was the actual claims handler (the beautiful Virginia Madsen), does the plaintiff's case gain momentum, culminating in a ""Gotcha!"" moment when the company's CEO (Roy Scheider) is put on the stand and asked to read from the corporate claims manual.  Again, as the viewer we readily know where this movie is going, and how it will end, yet it's still riveting and very much compelling.  THE RAIN MAKER is proof positive that a predictable courtroom thriller can be good, because it's a darn fine film in its own right.--D.

Here you get to mix that with courtroom drama and our all encompassing love for insurance companies.Here's the scoop. A newly Barred lawyer (Matt Damon) is handling a few cases. The biggest involves the family of a young man with leukemia whose medical claim was denied by his insurance company, resulting in his death. So his first courtroom adventure puts him, and his partner, Danny DeVito (Who's failed the Barr exam 6 times) up against some high caliber lawyers.This is a tight, efficient flick. Coppola uses a quieter hand on this. It doesn't have the razzle-dazzle of the ""Godfather"" flicks or ""Apocalypse Now"" but the camera always seems to be in the right place and things move well within the frame. This is a near seamless endeavor. The set-up almost requires certain cliches and they are here. Thankfully they're kept to a minimum. This is one of Damon's earlier credited roles but he already shows a comfort in front of he camera. Claire Daines and Danny DeVito were already well into their careers and both do a good job. John Voight plays a real slimeball so it's nice seeing him get his rear-end handed to him.This is better craft than it is art. It's a bowl of beef stew on a cold night.

Damon was a new lawyer, fresh out of law school, and just passing the bar exam. De Vito was a paralegal assistant who had failed the bar exam six times. They paired up at a sleazy ambulance-chasing law firm until the heat got too high, then left to form and open their own law office in an ultra-low-rent part of town and began their own type of ambulance chasing. Some of their cases were really pathetic, including the main case in the movie. A young man was near death with leukemia and a sleazy health insurance company with high-powered attorneys refused to pay for the needed bone-marrow transplan to keep him alive. He died. The case went to court. It was Damon and De Vito, baptized under fire, against the powerful lawyers of the insurance company. Well, you know who's going to win, or we wouldn't have a movie, but it was still an exciting drama to witness.The acting in this movie was quite excellent. It was the first major movie for Damon and he excelled. I don't particularly care for De Vito, but I'd here give him credit for the best acting I've ever seen him do. The rest of the cast was more than adequate. The filming, sound and direction were excellent. The story had a nice flow and attention never waned. The story was gripping and somewhat gut wrenching.

But while his more well-off, well-connected fellow graduates are headed for prestigious law firms, Rudy's prospects are dim. For the past three years he's made ends meet by tending bar at the local sleazy watering hole, and it's there that he makes his own connections. Rudy's voice-over narration informs us of his plight. ""There are too many lawyers in Memphis,"" he rails. ""This city is infested with them.""It's at the bar that he meets ""Bruiser"" Stone (Mickey Rourke), an extremely disreputable lawyer. With no better options, Rudy accepts an offer to work for his firm. ""There's nothing more embarassing than working for a guy named Bruiser Stone,"" Rudy muses. ""I mean, he's a lawyer and they call him 'Bruiser.' That's how desperate I am."" Rudy is introduced to Deck Shifflet (Danny DeVito), a ""para-lawyer"" who specializes in relentless ambulance chasing. DeVito approaches his meaty role with relish. He plays Deck as a shifty operator but, damn, if he doesn't make him endearing. Deck may have flunked the bar exam six times running, but his real-world savvy and natural sneakiness soon render him indispensable to Rudy.Rudy learns that his job with Bruiser's isn't a salaried position, that he's expected to generate his own cases and his own fees. I don't know how hands-on Grisham ever got with regards to the scuzzy underbelly of lawyering, but, oboy, it's fascinating to watch his characters here, inhabiting the gutters and back alleys of the legal field. Rudy's lofty idealism is eroding faster than his boss' credibility, and it's only exarcebated when Bruiser's operations come under intense FBI scrutiny. One blink, and Bruiser Stone has gone on the lam.Deck's feral instincts convince Rudy it's time that they scamper and establish their own low-rent legal practice. They're hanging their hat on a high-profile insurance case in which a legitimate claim was wrongfully denied. In kicking sand in the face of the giant insurance company, Great Benefit, Rudy finds himself challenging Leo F. Drummond (Voight), Great Benefit's silky smooth lawyer and Memphis' biggest legal shark. Rudy Baylor, needless to say, is ridiculously outgunned. It's what makes this movie so much fun.Grisham introduces two sub-plots, one involving Rudy's relationship with a sweet old lady who becomes his landlady. I wished the film had included the scenes in the book in which Rudy goes out of his way to evade the yard chores he'd promised to do for the old lady as part of his rental obligation.Rudy, in the course of his ambulance chasing, enters into a tentative romance with a battered young wife (Claire Danes), and I won't lie that it's frustrating that it takes forever for Claire Danes' character to dump her abusive husband. What eventually unfolds sinks Rudy even deeper into murky legal waters.To help evoke that old-time atmosphere, a host of people constantly puff away at their cigarettes. I guess there's nothing like a cloud of tobacco smoke to lend to verisimilitude. The jazz score itself, thick and sweet like molasses, fine-tunes that ambiance. I found THE RAINMAKER to be massively entertaining. It's Francis Ford Coppola at the helm, and so right away there's credibility attached. The film profits from rich and textured storytelling, from several powerhouse performances (and a parade of small character turns from Danny Glover, Dean Stockwell, Roy Scheider, and Virginia Madsen), and from a clear rooting sentiment for the underdog. That last bit isn't anything new for a Grisham thriller. The ""Underdog Lawyer vs. Dodgy Corporate Conglomerate"" theme is practically the house specialty on the Grisham menu. But it never gets old when the little guy turns the table on them smug villains. Rudy and Deck find themselves subjected to underhanded shenanigans by the Great Benefit legal team, and the big fun then lies in cheering Rudy and Deck on as they, in a succession of crowd-pleasing moments, reverse their sticky situation. In retrospect, because it's that kind of movie, and because this is a John Grisham story, those big-time legal sharks never stood a chance. Watching Matt Damon's earnest character pull it off, all I can do is quote his old landlady: ""Not bad for a yard boy.""This is the Special Collector's Edition.

439771,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,6304925131,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[3, 6]","One more legal thriller, you will say. Yes and no. Yes, because it is a thriller in the courtroom with a judge and lawyers and cases, victims and culprits, a jury and all of it. But it is more than that. It is the dilemma of a young lawyer who is confronted to an impossible choice: he is getting involved with his clients, emotionally involved and that is not good. You can't be the lawyer of the woman you love. You can't be the lawyer of a young man who is dying of leukemia and for whom you feel too much compassion. But that problem is secondary in that film, though it explains the end, the very final scene. This film is essential because it deals with three cases that are absolutely typical in our society. The first case is an old woman who has an important inheritance and she does not want to give it to her own son and his wife because they hate her and they only want her money. That's about what we do with our senior citizens, and what they do with themselves if they still have that much control of their future. Then let the lawyer write the will. Then you have a young married woman who is systematically beaten up by her husband and she does not dare to get a divorce because she is afraid. Then the lawyer is the only recourse to convince her she has to put an end to that situation. Then there is the central case, that of the young man dying of leukemia because his insurance company denied the claim. In that case, and that film is not quite young, we have all the arguments we have been able to hear against any kind of public management of health insurance coverage. That case was representative of the debate that had been going on for decades, since the war, since the new bill of rights of Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1944. Public health is a national asset and the nation through its representatives is entitled to manage it for everyone to have access to the best health coverage possible. Along that line the film is extremely emotional, even passionate and the arguments are no longer important when you are dealing with the pictures of a dying young man, of a beaten young woman, of an old hated woman. But the film is effective and calls for a response from the audience. It is that direct address to the audience's feelings and emotions, other than fear, fright and dread, or horror, terror and phobia, or violence, brutality and fury, that make the film interesting and probably lasting.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Cr&eacute;teil, CEGID",4,A masterpiece of legal suspense,1111276800,"03 20, 2005",2005,2555,"['One', 'more', 'legal', 'thriller', 'will', 'say', 'Yes', 'Yes', 'thriller', 'courtroom', 'judge', 'lawyers', 'cases', 'victims', 'culprits', 'jury', 'more', 'dilemma', 'young', 'lawyer', 'who', 'confronted', 'impossible', 'choice', 'getting', 'involved', 'clients', 'emotionally', 'involved', 'not', 'good', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'lawyer', 'woman', 'love', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'lawyer', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'dying', 'leukemia', 'whom', 'feel', 'too', 'much', 'compassion', 'problem', 'secondary', 'film', 'end', 'very', 'final', 'scene', 'film', 'essential', 'three', 'cases', 'are', 'absolutely', 'typical', 'society', 'first', 'case', 'old', 'woman', 'who', 'important', 'inheritance', 'not', 'want', 'give', 'own', 'son', 'wife', 'hate', 'only', 'want', 'money', 'what', 'do', 'senior', 'citizens', 'what', 'do', 'still', 'have', 'that', 'much', 'control', 'future', 'Then', 'let', 'lawyer', 'write', 'will', 'Then', 'have', 'young', 'married', 'woman', 'who', 'systematically', 'beaten', 'up', 'husband', 'not', 'dare', 'get', 'divorce', 'afraid', 'Then', 'lawyer', 'only', 'recourse', 'convince', 'put', 'end', 'situation', 'Then', 'central', 'case', 'young', 'man', 'dying', 'leukemia', 'insurance', 'company', 'denied', 'claim', 'case', 'film', 'not', 'quite', 'young', 'have', 'arguments', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'hear', 'kind', 'public', 'management', 'health', 'insurance', 'coverage', 'case', 'was', 'representative', 'debate', 'had', 'been', 'going', 'decades', 'war', 'new', 'bill', 'rights', 'Franklin', 'D.', 'Roosevelt', '1944', 'Public', 'health', 'national', 'asset', 'nation', 'representatives', 'entitled', 'manage', 'everyone', 'have', 'access', 'best', 'health', 'coverage', 'possible', 'line', 'film', 'extremely', 'emotional', 'even', 'passionate', 'arguments', 'are', 'no', 'longer', 'important', 'when', 'are', 'dealing', 'pictures', 'dying', 'young', 'man', 'beaten', 'young', 'woman', 'old', 'hated', 'woman', 'film', 'effective', 'response', 'audience', 'direct', 'address', 'audience', 'feelings', 'emotions', 'other', 'fear', 'fright', 'dread', 'horror', 'terror', 'phobia', 'violence', 'brutality', 'fury', 'make', 'film', 'interesting', 'probably', 'lasting.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU', 'University', 'Paris', '1', 'Pantheon', 'Sorbonne', 'University', 'Paris', '8', 'Saint', 'Denis', 'University', 'Paris', '12', 'Cr', 'eacute', 'CEGID']",N/A

The insurance company declares bankruptcy, no one wins a penny.Yet the family of the leukemia victim finds peace of mind in putting a corrupt firm out of business, while Danes and Damon depart together to contemplate their futures; their lives already deeply disillusioned.One point- the film's title may confuse some- this is not ""Rainman"" with Dustin Hoffman.However, this movie can stand on its own two feet in any weather, thank you.",5,SOUTHERN FRIED JUSTICE,1200355200,"01 15, 2008",2008,1006,"['Terrific', 'film', 'featuring', 'Bahstin', 'favorite', 'Damon', 'fluently', 'adapting', 'southern', 'dialect', 'novice', 'lawyer', 'genuinely', 'interested', 'helping', 'underdog', 'clientele', 'DeVito', 'equally', 'effective', 'setup', 'man', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'pass', 'Bar', 'exam', 'terrific', 'funnel', 'future', 'clients.The', 'duet', 'legitimate', 'partnership', 'away', 'go', 'Damon', 'simultaneously', 'defending', 'dying', 'young', 'man', 'corrupt', 'insurance', 'company', 'young', 'woman', 'Danes', 'who', 'finally', 'end', 'wife', 'beating', 'husband.With', 'DeVito', 'doing', 'legwork', 'heroes', 'win', 'cases', 'too', 'well', 'fact', 'insurance', 'company', 'bankruptcy', 'one', 'penny.Yet', 'family', 'leukemia', 'victim', 'peace', 'mind', 'putting', 'corrupt', 'firm', 'business', 'Danes', 'Damon', 'depart', 'together', 'contemplate', 'futures', 'lives', 'already', 'deeply', 'disillusioned.One', 'point-', 'film', 'title', 'may', 'confuse', 'some-', 'not', 'Rainman', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman.However', 'movie', 'can', 'stand', 'own', 'two', 'feet', 'weather', 'thank']",N/A

439783,A2GRKG9CERAI1S,6304925131,"John Doe ""Mutant (AKA_Homo Superior)""","[2, 3]","I work for the Insurance Industry for 10 years. Within the 1st years, I found out that they denied 50% of the claims AUTOMATICALLY. And the people that are being denied the claims are the one that get in trouble when they try to contemplate retaliation for denial of claims.  As this Insurance company has a retired FBI agent in charge of claim investigation thus throught this connection, they have the backing of the FBI.  And many Insurance Companies have retired law enforcement officers working for them thus have the backing of law enforcement.Over the 10 years I've seen lot of craps and experience lot of things. With each company I worked for more disgusting than the last.  It was hard to describe what I experience and see to outsider.  As most people are naive about the real world. They only see the world that is portray by propagandas that is created by each industrial group, clandestine organizations & clans (For basic concept of the INVISIBLE world of clans & clandestine activities, readCIA, INC.: Espionage and the Craft of Business Intelligence,A History Of Secret Societies&Secret Messages: Concealment, Codes, and Other Types of Ingenious Communication).When this movie first came out, I was amaze at how accurate they portrait the Insurance Companies. From the way they operate to the character of the people in the Insurance Company. The only part that was a little off was the way they portray the Insurance Company denying 100% of the claims. It was a little bit exaggerated but I guess they were trying to make a point. When you exaggerate something a little bit, it hits a little bit harder if you are trying to make a point. Or maybe they could be right in that there is probably an Insurance Company out there denying 100% of the claims and get away with it.From my experience, I would say 50%.  Even if you are two faces, one face is professional and the other is evil, the evil face is only one out of two faces. 1 out of 2 = 1/2 = 50%.Even mathematically the 50% figures match with the 50% I experience from working for the Insurance Companies. Thus my experience can even be verified mathematically. But the math is back up by my own experience thus it is scientifically correct.If you want to see how Corporate Insurances operate, this will give some idea of what it is like.  You can never experience what I observed over the 10 years of working for Insurance Companies in a 2 hours movie. (For an example of my observation skill, read my review onSkid Row (Full Screen)) And since I was lay off from the Insurance Industry/Insurance Companies in the year 2000, I've probably consciously forgotten more than this movie could ever portrait.  But at least you will get a peak of the inner working mechanism of an Insurance Company.If after watching this movie you feel outrage by the injustice you see, then I would recommend you get Insurance with a Non-profit Insurance Companies.  At the moment of this posting there are 83 Non-profit Health Insurance Companies in America.I assume that without the necessity for profit, the need to commit the injustice noted in this movie would decrease substantially.  I guess if you have to paid out $500 millions dollars to the stock holders or your parent company, you would consider committing the injustice shown in this movie to meet your obligation.If you want to find out more about Non-profit Health Insurance Companies, go to ""nonprofithealthcare dot org"" for vast resource about Non-profit Health Insurance Companies.Also a Mutual Insurance Company is another option over a Non-Profit Insurance Company.  Mutual Insurance is the equivalent of a Credit Union in the insurance industry.  If any of you are already banking with a Credit Union, then you would know exactly what a Mutual Insurance Company is.  For more information about Mutual Insurance, do a Wikipedia search for ""Mutual Insurance"".If you are a big business entity or group, you can always self insured thus cut out the middleman.  Go to ""Self-Insurance Institute of America"" website at ""siia dot org"" for more information about how insurance operates and how self insurance works.Note:1) If there is any doubt about what I am saying here about the Insurance Companies, I am willing to swear on the bible, in a court of law under the penalty of perjury, which is a felony, and all the legal consequences of perjury.",5,This movie express what was in my soul,1272499200,"04 29, 2010",2010,4365,"['work', 'Insurance', 'Industry', '10', 'years', '1st', 'years', 'found', 'out', 'denied', '50', '%', 'claims', 'AUTOMATICALLY', 'people', 'are', 'being', 'denied', 'claims', 'are', 'one', 'get', 'trouble', 'when', 'try', 'contemplate', 'retaliation', 'denial', 'claims', 'Insurance', 'company', 'retired', 'FBI', 'agent', 'charge', 'claim', 'investigation', 'thus', 'throught', 'connection', 'have', 'backing', 'FBI', 'many', 'Insurance', 'Companies', 'have', 'retired', 'law', 'enforcement', 'officers', 'working', 'thus', 'have', 'backing', 'law', '10', 'years', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'lot', 'craps', 'experience', 'lot', 'things', 'company', 'worked', 'more', 'disgusting', 'last', 'was', 'hard', 'describe', 'what', 'experience', 'see', 'outsider', 'most', 'people', 'are', 'naive', 'real', 'world', 'only', 'see', 'world', 'portray', 'propagandas', 'created', 'industrial', 'group', 'clandestine', 'organizations', 'clans', 'basic', 'concept', 'INVISIBLE', 'world', 'clans', 'clandestine', 'activities', 'readCIA', 'INC.', 'Espionage', 'Craft', 'Business', 'Intelligence', 'A', 'History', 'Secret', 'Societies', 'Secret', 'Messages', 'Concealment', 'Codes', 'Other', 'Types', 'Ingenious', 'Communication', '.When', 'movie', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'was', 'amaze', 'how', 'accurate', 'portrait', 'Insurance', 'Companies', 'way', 'operate', 'character', 'people', 'Insurance', 'Company', 'only', 'part', 'was', 'little', 'off', 'was', 'way', 'portray', 'Insurance', 'Company', 'denying', '100', '%', 'claims', 'was', 'little', 'bit', 'exaggerated', 'guess', 'were', 'trying', 'make', 'point', 'When', 'exaggerate', 'something', 'little', 'bit', 'little', 'bit', 'harder', 'are', 'trying', 'make', 'point', 'maybe', 'could', 'be', 'right', 'probably', 'Insurance', 'Company', 'there', 'denying', '100', '%', 'claims', 'get', 'away', 'it.From', 'experience', 'would', 'say', '50', '%', 'Even', 'are', 'two', 'one', 'face', 'professional', 'other', 'evil', 'evil', 'face', 'only', 'one', 'two', '1', '2', '=', '1/2', '=', '50', '%', '.Even', 'mathematically', '50', '%', 'figures', 'match', '50', '%', 'experience', 'working', 'Insurance', 'Companies', 'Thus', 'experience', 'can', 'even', 'be', 'verified', 'mathematically', 'math', 'back', 'up', 'own', 'experience', 'thus', 'scientifically', 'correct.If', 'want', 'see', 'how', 'Corporate', 'Insurances', 'operate', 'will', 'give', 'idea', 'what', 'can', 'never', 'experience', 'what', 'observed', '10', 'years', 'working', 'Insurance', 'Companies', '2', 'hours', 'movie', 'example', 'observation', 'skill', 'read', 'review', 'onSkid', 'Row', 'Full', 'Screen', 'was', 'lay', 'off', 'Insurance', 'Industry/Insurance', 'Companies', 'year', '2000', ""'ve"", 'probably', 'consciously', 'more', 'movie', 'could', 'ever', 'portrait', 'least', 'will', 'get', 'peak', 'inner', 'working', 'mechanism', 'Insurance', 'Company.If', 'watching', 'movie', 'feel', 'outrage', 'injustice', 'see', 'then', 'would', 'recommend', 'get', 'Insurance', 'Non-profit', 'Insurance', 'Companies', 'moment', 'posting', 'are', '83', 'Non-profit', 'Health', 'Insurance', 'Companies', 'America.I', 'assume', 'necessity', 'profit', 'need', 'commit', 'injustice', 'noted', 'movie', 'would', 'decrease', 'substantially', 'guess', 'have', 'paid', 'out', '500', 'millions', 'dollars', 'stock', 'holders', 'parent', 'company', 'would', 'consider', 'committing', 'injustice', 'shown', 'movie', 'meet', 'obligation.If', 'want', 'find', 'out', 'more', 'Non-profit', 'Health', 'Insurance', 'Companies', 'go', 'nonprofithealthcare', 'dot', 'org', 'vast', 'resource', 'Non-profit', 'Health', 'Insurance', 'Companies.Also', 'Mutual', 'Insurance', 'Company', 'option', 'Non-Profit', 'Insurance', 'Company', 'Mutual', 'Insurance', 'equivalent', 'Credit', 'Union', 'insurance', 'industry', 'are', 'already', 'banking', 'Credit', 'Union', 'then', 'would', 'know', 'exactly', 'what', 'Mutual', 'Insurance', 'Company', 'more', 'information', 'Mutual', 'Insurance', 'do', 'Wikipedia', 'search', 'Mutual', 'Insurance', 'are', 'big', 'business', 'entity', 'group', 'can', 'always', 'self', 'insured', 'thus', 'cut', 'out', 'middleman', 'Go', 'Self-Insurance', 'Institute', 'America', 'website', 'siia', 'dot', 'org', 'more', 'information', 'how', 'insurance', 'how', 'self', 'insurance', 'works.Note:1', 'doubt', 'what', 'am', 'saying', 'here', 'Insurance', 'Companies', 'am', 'willing', 'swear', 'bible', 'court', 'law', 'penalty', 'perjury', 'felony', 'legal', 'consequences', 'perjury']",N/A

As a result, and all too often in recent years, Hollywood's extremist political views are inserted gratuitously in obviously opportunistic ways, getting between the viewer and the story, and turning it all into a lame joke.  Hopefully, most viewers can see it for what it is, but Hollywood's intention seems to be that many of them will get swept up in the emotion and accept it all as one package, including the misguided and misleading politics.

Aided by intelligent but six-time bar exam flunker Danny DeVito and his contacts, Damon wins the suit along with a monumental punitive award.  Unfortunately, the insurance company is but a shell, having been looted by its CEO (Roy Scheider), and no damages are paid.We are left with two memorable images:  1)Damon pondering his future in law - should he continue (and undoubtedly end up using the law to fight justice - as did his opponent, Jon Voight), or take his love of the law and go into teaching?  2)DeVito heading out the door in pursuit of another attempt at passing the bar.",5,"Heartwarming, Inspiring",1168128000,"01 7, 2007",2007,915,"['Matt', 'Damon', 'freshly', 'minted', 'lawyer', 'fighting', 'large', 'insurance', 'company', 'simply', 'insurance', 'paying', 'benefits', 'case', 'denied', 'payment', 'life-saving', 'treatment', 'dying', 'young', 'man', 'insurance', 'company', 'side', 'taken', 'highly-experienced', 'attorneys', 'billing', 'thousand', 'dollars/hour', 'Aided', 'intelligent', 'six-time', 'bar', 'exam', 'flunker', 'Danny', 'DeVito', 'contacts', 'Damon', 'suit', 'monumental', 'punitive', 'award', 'Unfortunately', 'insurance', 'company', 'shell', 'having', 'been', 'looted', 'CEO', 'Roy', 'Scheider', 'damages', 'are', 'paid.We', 'are', 'left', 'two', 'memorable', 'images', '1', 'Damon', 'pondering', 'future', 'law', 'should', 'continue', 'undoubtedly', 'end', 'up', 'using', 'law', 'fight', 'justice', 'did', 'opponent', 'Jon', 'Voight', 'take', 'love', 'law', 'go', 'teaching', '2', 'DeVito', 'heading', 'out', 'door', 'pursuit', 'attempt', 'passing', 'bar']",N/A

439807,A22ECY1OSXEVS1,6304925131,Michael A. Brocato,"[0, 0]","Readers of John Grisham's book will find this film rather less of a thriller and more of a courtroom drama, albeit with a curious flat feel to it. The story is that of a legal action on behalf of a teenage boy denied coverage for an expensive bone marrow transplant by his family's medical insurer. Changes to the plotline to accommodate the story to the demands of film drama have removed the unique feature of the book &#8211; a largely successful attempt to make the details of legal civil procedure interesting. Francis Coppola is a very innovative yet conventional director (you could credit him with authorship of several current movie clich&eacute;s) and his storylines develop according to convention. Thus the love affair, which is completely extraneous to the main storyline in the book, is pumped up, and the fascinating battle of wits between the lawyers played down. As in the book, Rudy is the tyro David up against the experienced Goliath, Drummond, but Rudy's inexperience is played up to the point that you wonder how he got this far. The trial judge, who in the book is extremely helpful to Rudy, is replaced in the film by a sympathetic but much more impartial figure. In Hollywood conventional courtroom drama, His Honor or Her Honor doesn't take sides.That said, there is much to enjoy. Danny de Vito, playing Deck the paralegal (or `paralawyer' as Rudy names him) who can't seem to pass the bar exam, is just brilliant. His Deck is a disheveled, unimpressive little guy who is nonetheless good at what he does, `rainmaking' or finding new business. His strengths are his intelligence, his energy and his lack of pride; he is quite happy to chase ambulances and give cops backhanders for information. His ethics are simple: fight for your client, don't steal and try not to lie. While the Deck of the book verges on the grotesque, De Vito makes him less of an oddball and hence more sympathetic. Matt Damon as Rudy is wetter behind the ears and not such a quick learner as the Rudy of the book, but every so often he connects and we understand how he feels. Mickey Rourke is a bit too elegant as Bruiser, Rudy's erstwhile mentor, (who wears cufflinks on a tropical beach?) but it's also an enjoyable performance. Although the script tones down his role, John Voight is nastily urbane as superlawyer Drummond.Once again we have a courtroom drama filmed in a grand but gloomy courtroom, in fact the lighting people seem to have been absent. We hardly get a glimpse of the face of one important minor character, Cliff the wife-beater, (Andrew Shue) yet there is no apparent reason for this. The way some of the scenes were strung together, and started and finished were vaguely familiar, and half way through it hit me - ` The Godfather', where scenes just seem to begin and end without any particular reason.One thing the film does almost as well as the book is send the message (sorry Mr Goldwyn) that America needs to do something about its medical insurance system, if the present chaotic mess can be so described. The court system, while not perfect, comes out of it a bit better (David is able to beat Goliath fair and square) but as for lawyers&#8230;well, let's just say things would be a lot better if they stuck to Deck's minimal ethics. The story also might explain why John Grisham (who has a walk-on role as a lawyer at an al fresco deposition) gave up the law to write books, thus bringing pleasure to millions instead of (hopefully) winning retribution for a few.",4,Not as thrilling as the book... movie centers more on the courtoom drama.,1370649600,"06 8, 2013",2013,3496,"['Readers', 'John', 'Grisham', 'book', 'will', 'find', 'film', 'rather', 'less', 'thriller', 'more', 'courtroom', 'drama', 'curious', 'flat', 'feel', 'story', 'legal', 'action', 'behalf', 'teenage', 'boy', 'denied', 'coverage', 'expensive', 'bone', 'marrow', 'transplant', 'family', 'medical', 'insurer', 'Changes', 'plotline', 'accommodate', 'story', 'demands', 'film', 'drama', 'have', 'removed', 'unique', 'feature', 'book', '8211', 'largely', 'successful', 'attempt', 'make', 'details', 'legal', 'civil', 'procedure', 'interesting', 'Francis', 'Coppola', 'very', 'innovative', 'conventional', 'director', 'could', 'credit', 'authorship', 'several', 'current', 'movie', 'clich', 'eacute', 'storylines', 'develop', 'according', 'convention', 'Thus', 'love', 'affair', 'completely', 'extraneous', 'main', 'storyline', 'book', 'pumped', 'up', 'fascinating', 'battle', 'wits', 'lawyers', 'played', 'down', 'book', 'Rudy', 'tyro', 'David', 'up', 'experienced', 'Goliath', 'Drummond', 'Rudy', 'inexperience', 'played', 'up', 'point', 'wonder', 'how', 'got', 'far', 'trial', 'judge', 'who', 'book', 'extremely', 'helpful', 'Rudy', 'replaced', 'film', 'sympathetic', 'much', 'more', 'impartial', 'figure', 'Hollywood', 'conventional', 'courtroom', 'drama', 'Honor', 'Honor', ""n't"", 'take', 'sides.That', 'said', 'much', 'enjoy', 'Danny', 'Vito', 'playing', 'Deck', 'paralegal', 'paralawyer', 'Rudy', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'pass', 'bar', 'exam', 'just', 'brilliant', 'Deck', 'disheveled', 'unimpressive', 'little', 'guy', 'who', 'nonetheless', 'good', 'what', 'rainmaking', 'finding', 'new', 'business', 'strengths', 'are', 'intelligence', 'energy', 'lack', 'pride', 'quite', 'happy', 'chase', 'ambulances', 'give', 'cops', 'backhanders', 'information', 'ethics', 'are', 'simple', 'fight', 'client', 'do', ""n't"", 'steal', 'try', 'not', 'lie', 'Deck', 'book', 'grotesque', 'De', 'Vito', 'less', 'oddball', 'hence', 'more', 'sympathetic', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'Rudy', 'wetter', 'ears', 'not', 'such', 'quick', 'learner', 'Rudy', 'book', 'so', 'often', 'understand', 'how', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'bit', 'too', 'elegant', 'Bruiser', 'Rudy', 'erstwhile', 'mentor', 'who', 'cufflinks', 'tropical', 'beach', 'also', 'enjoyable', 'performance', 'script', 'down', 'role', 'John', 'Voight', 'nastily', 'urbane', 'superlawyer', 'Drummond.Once', 'again', 'have', 'courtroom', 'drama', 'filmed', 'grand', 'gloomy', 'courtroom', 'fact', 'lighting', 'people', 'seem', 'have', 'been', 'absent', 'hardly', 'get', 'glimpse', 'face', 'one', 'important', 'minor', 'character', 'Cliff', 'wife-beater', 'Andrew', 'Shue', 'yet', 'apparent', 'reason', 'way', 'scenes', 'were', 'strung', 'together', 'started', 'finished', 'were', 'vaguely', 'familiar', 'way', 'hit', 'Godfather', 'where', 'scenes', 'just', 'seem', 'begin', 'end', 'particular', 'reason.One', 'thing', 'film', 'almost', 'as', 'well', 'book', 'send', 'message', 'sorry', 'Mr', 'Goldwyn', 'America', 'do', 'something', 'medical', 'insurance', 'system', 'present', 'chaotic', 'mess', 'can', 'be', 'so', 'described', 'court', 'system', 'not', 'perfect', 'bit', 'better', 'David', 'able', 'beat', 'Goliath', 'fair', 'square', 'lawyers', '8230', 'well', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'things', 'would', 'be', 'lot', 'better', 'stuck', 'Deck', 'minimal', 'ethics', 'story', 'also', 'might', 'explain', 'why', 'John', 'Grisham', 'who', 'walk-on', 'role', 'lawyer', 'al', 'fresco', 'deposition', 'gave', 'up', 'law', 'write', 'books', 'thus', 'bringing', 'pleasure', 'millions', 'instead', 'hopefully', 'winning', 'retribution', 'few']",N/A

Director Francis Ford Coppola explores no new grounds in this film, but elicits competent and professional performances from a stellar cast.  Matt Damon who plays Rudy burst onto the scene in this movie, released just before his Oscar winning screenplay and starring role in GOOD WILL HUNTING.  Damon captures the youthful impetuosity and naivete of a just bar-approved lawyer who finds himself involved in a case against a big insurance company.  His assistant is played by a restrained Danny DeVito.  Their boss is played by an unusually understated Mickey Rourke, who shows up on screen looking halfway decent for a change. His clients are wonderfully played by Mary Kay Place and Johnny Whitworth.  Jon Voight delivers an Oscar-worthy performance as Damon's devilishly cold opponent; Roy Scheider has a brief scene as the CEO of the insurance company; Randy Travis has a thirty second scene as an irate juror; Virginia Madsen is wonderful in a small role as the claims adjustor who was fired; Claire Danes is appropriately cast as the abused wife who turns to Damon for help.  Oscar winner Teresa Wright turns up in a lovely role as an elderly lady who wants to leave her money to a tv evangelist.THE RAINMAKER is perhaps a little too long (it clocks in well over two hours), and offers little in the way of suspense.

439810,A2VGKGXSG81KAS,6304925131,Michael J. Berquist,"[58, 70]","Matt Damon was a relative unknown when he was tapped to play the hero of &quot;The Rainmaker&quot;, based on a novel by John Grisham &amp; directed by Francis Ford Coppola. It was a twist of fate that launched Damon's  career and definitely lifted this movie. (Ironically, Matthew McConaughey  got his start the same way- being an unknown cast in a movie based on a  Grisham novel.)The plot is a classic David-vs-Goliath story- fresh out  of law school Matt Damon sues an insurance company for denying treatment to  a family with cancer. Ultimately Damon triumphs- the righteous cause  succees and the system works. Damon is a major talent, as evidenced by his  performance in this film. He's shy, unsure of himself, but basically a good  person committed to doing what's right.I wasn't too impressed by the  rest of the cast- Claire Danes is a talented actress but fails to shine  here. Danny DeVito is okay as Damon's law partner, and Jon Voight comes  across as a none-too-interesting arrogant villain. The rest of the cast?  Nobody stands out- this is Damon's show.What impressed me about  &quot;The Rainmaker&quot; was its hard, unflinching portrayal of the legal  profession. A lawyer's life is not glamorous and does not necessarily  guarantee a huge paycheck. Those quick to criticize lawyers ought to take  some law courses before they open their mouths- the road to becoming a  lawyer is rough and a considerable commitment of both your time and  financial resources. Despite his law degree, Damon's financial picture at  the beginning of the film is decidedly precarious.Watch &quot;The  Rainmaker&quot; along with &quot;A Civil Action&quot; and &quot;Erin  Brockovich&quot; to get a pretty good idea about the way the law works  &amp; how courts give the little people an avenue to even up with big shots  like corporations and insurance companies.

439818,A20ZFWGBY4REFX,6304925131,"Nicholas Williams ""movie, music, and book fan""","[2, 3]","John Grisham's ""The Rainmaker"" is a film that is nothing short of astonishing or powerful. This is director Francis Ford Coppola's best film since ""Apocalypse Now"" and ""The Godfather"" series. And to me, ""The Rainmaker"" is more of a powerful drama than it is a thinking person's film alongside the other Grisham adaptions: ""The Firm"", ""The Pelican Brief"", ""The Client"", ""A Time to Kill"", and ""The Chamber"". ""The Rainmaker"" focuses on a Memphis law student named Ruby Baylor (Matt Damon in one of his finest performances) who is reluctantly hired by a shady lawyer named Bruiser Stone (Mickey Rourke) at a sleazy practice. Rudy is partnered up with Deck Schifflet (Danny DeVito in another fine performance), a seasoned ""para-lawyer"" who failed the Bar Exam 6 times and specializes in it. Deck teaches Rudy the tricks of the trade is Rudy is to move on at all. During the film, Rudy takes on the biggest case of his career: the case of Great Benefit, a life insurance company that has denied a family's claim 8 times and stating in the letter: ""You must be stupid, stupid, stupid."" That family is the Black family (led by Mary Kay Place, ""The Big Chill""). Their son, Donny Ray, is diagnosed with leukemia. The company just sat back and watched Donny Ray's life slip away, and basically, Rudy just couldn't take it anymore. As he goes up against the company's lawyers (including Jon Voight), Rudy also comes to the aid of Kelly Riker (Claire Danes), a young woman who has been abused by her husband far too many times. And the movie goes on from there. Basically, ""The Rainmaker"" has the same spirit as any other courtroom drama or as any other Grisham novel. A lot of the credit goes to Matt Damon, Danny DeVito, Claire Danes, Jon Voight, Mary Kay Place, Virginia Madsen, Mickey Rourke, Dean Stockwell, and two special appearances by Danny Glover and Randy Travis for their excellent performances.

Rios,"[3, 3]","I rented John Grisham's The Rainmaker and i have to say, i enjoyed the movie.from the very beginning to the end, it was a very thoughtful, well crafted, well acted out movie with a heck of a story line and full of IRONY.The very title, The Rainmaker almost implies to play God, to dictate circumstances so to speak.Rudy Baylor (Matt Damon) is a fresh out of law school attorney who sets the tone of his character at the very beginning of the movie when he says that he bartended to go to law school and how unlike other attorneys, he didn't have anything available after finishing law school. No law firms waiting, nothing. He had to look for a job.Danny DeVito's character is a paralawyer, he finished law school but can't pass the bar exam (6 times failed). He works for a law firm owned by Bruiser Stone (Mickey Rourke) in Memphis, who in turn, hires Rudy to basically be an ambulance chasing attorney.DeVito finds out that the law firm they work for is about to get raided by the Government, so he and Damon start their own law firm and quickly start working on the case of Donny, a young 20 something year old kid who is dying of leukemia. He was denied a bone marrow transplant 8 times by the insurance company Great Benefit.Rudy sues on behalf of Donny's mother and the court action between a rookie fresh out of law school lawyer-just passed the bar exam, and his first ever case and Jon Voit, an experienced trial lawyer is very interesting.It's Big Coporation vs the little man.Along the way, Rudy has help from Devito, who is constantly digging up new information, presenting case history to back a ruling, and finding the secretary of one of Great Benefit's executives who claim she ""resigned"" and wasn't fired and who can also help expose the truth.I say The Rainmaker has a double meaning because even though Rudy had the truth on his side, he did do some fancy lawyer tricks with the help of DeVito's character. So they burn the insurance giant and get a ruling of almost $50 million in damages, but...as the title of the movie goes, Great Benefit in turn files for bankruptcy and in the end, nobody really wins.Donny is gone, Rudy has no income because of the bankruptcy, DeVito leaves his partnership with Rudy, and in the end, Great Benefit lost, won, and then lost again by losing the suit, winning the bankruptcy case, and then going out of business.it's a very interesting story nonetheless and as a fan of lawyer movies, it's a must see.",5,The Rainmaker....the Irony of Irony,1238371200,"03 30, 2009",2009,2459,"['rented', 'John', 'Grisham', 'Rainmaker', 'i', 'have', 'say', 'i', 'enjoyed', 'movie.from', 'very', 'beginning', 'end', 'was', 'very', 'thoughtful', 'well', 'crafted', 'well', 'acted', 'out', 'movie', 'heck', 'story', 'line', 'full', 'IRONY.The', 'very', 'title', 'Rainmaker', 'almost', 'play', 'God', 'dictate', 'circumstances', 'so', 'speak.Rudy', 'Baylor', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'fresh', 'out', 'law', 'school', 'attorney', 'who', 'tone', 'character', 'very', 'beginning', 'movie', 'when', 'bartended', 'go', 'law', 'school', 'how', 'other', 'attorneys', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'anything', 'available', 'finishing', 'law', 'school', 'law', 'firms', 'waiting', 'nothing', 'had', 'look', 'job.Danny', 'DeVito', 'character', 'paralawyer', 'finished', 'law', 'school', 'ca', ""n't"", 'pass', 'bar', 'exam', '6', 'times', 'failed', 'law', 'firm', 'owned', 'Bruiser', 'Stone', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'Memphis', 'who', 'turn', 'Rudy', 'basically', 'be', 'ambulance', 'chasing', 'attorney.DeVito', 'out', 'law', 'firm', 'work', 'about', 'get', 'raided', 'Government', 'Damon', 'start', 'own', 'law', 'firm', 'quickly', 'start', 'working', 'case', 'Donny', 'young', '20', 'something', 'year', 'old', 'kid', 'who', 'dying', 'leukemia', 'was', 'denied', 'bone', 'marrow', 'transplant', '8', 'times', 'insurance', 'company', 'Great', 'Benefit.Rudy', 'sues', 'behalf', 'Donny', 'mother', 'court', 'action', 'rookie', 'fresh', 'law', 'school', 'lawyer-just', 'passed', 'bar', 'exam', 'first', 'ever', 'case', 'Jon', 'Voit', 'experienced', 'trial', 'lawyer', 'very', 'interesting.It', 'Big', 'Coporation', 'little', 'man.Along', 'way', 'Rudy', 'help', 'Devito', 'who', 'constantly', 'digging', 'up', 'new', 'information', 'presenting', 'case', 'history', 'back', 'ruling', 'finding', 'secretary', 'one', 'Great', 'Benefit', 'executives', 'who', 'claim', 'resigned', 'was', ""n't"", 'fired', 'who', 'can', 'also', 'help', 'expose', 'truth.I', 'say', 'Rainmaker', 'double', 'meaning', 'even', 'Rudy', 'had', 'truth', 'side', 'did', 'do', 'fancy', 'lawyer', 'tricks', 'help', 'DeVito', 'character', 'burn', 'insurance', 'giant', 'get', 'ruling', 'almost', '50', 'million', 'damages', 'title', 'movie', 'Great', 'Benefit', 'turn', 'files', 'bankruptcy', 'end', 'nobody', 'really', 'wins.Donny', 'gone', 'Rudy', 'income', 'bankruptcy', 'DeVito', 'partnership', 'Rudy', 'end', 'Great', 'Benefit', 'lost', 'won', 'then', 'lost', 'again', 'losing', 'suit', 'winning', 'bankruptcy', 'case', 'then', 'going', 'business.it', 'very', 'interesting', 'story', 'nonetheless', 'fan', 'lawyer', 'movies', 'must', 'see']",N/A

They don't seem to mesh well, and neither gets the emotional development they need to propel their stories as best they can. Perhaps the novel by John Grisham, which this film is based on, builds these two stories better, but I haven't read to book to find out. The film as is, though, is still intriguing and entertaining, despite its predictability as a typical court room story.Another distraction was the use of a lot of stereotypes and cliched characters. Though humorous at times, for the most part it takes away from the drama of the film, making it seem like you shouldn't take the film seriously. Which you should, it is primarily meant as a drama, it just overuses comic relief at times.Although this film was directed by Francis Ford Coppola, it doesn't seem to have any of his signature touches incorporated into it. I would never have guessed it was his film just by watching it. It's the film's cast though, not the director, that makes this film really worthwhile. Danny DeVito's supporting role is great as a paralawyer who's flunked the bar exam six times.

This includes visiting nurses, pain management, etc.  We are supposed to believe an employee of the insurance company wrote a letter to the family calling them, ""STUPID, STUPID, STUPID"".  I worked in the insurance business and anyone who did that would be FIRED.  Thus, the plot of this film insulted my intelligence.  If the patient had sound basis for a lawsuit an established attorney would have taken the case.  Instead he winds up represented by a fresh law school grad.  I resent being manipulated to believe our flawed medical and insurance systems are even worse than they really are.  You will not enjoy this movie, unless you are very gullible.  It is also depressing and fails to offer good background music, scenery, or any comic relief.

Coppola and the  cast clearly got their mojo working on this one.  The only reason I gave  this picture 4 stars instead of 5 is that it failed to include Grisham's  portrayal of Rudy Baylor in his last year of law school and the breakup of  the firm in which he thought he had a secure future.  It also doesn't do a  very good job of telling us how Rudy met Miss Birdie to begin with (again,  read the book).

The plot is a good one, and the acting is excellent.  The only detraction that really stuck out (assuming one suspends disbelief that a newly-minted attorney could become a rainmaker for a firm, albeit a sleazy, ambulance chasing one) is the dialogue in court.  As a particularly heinous example, when Damon begins to examine a plaintiff's witness at the beginning of trial, he asks multiple compound and leading questions.  Defense counsel objects to each question.  The court sustains each objection.  Damon's character has done substantial research to put the case together.  It is unbelievable that he would not have also reviewed (assuming he had never had any trial practice experience in law school) the proper way to examine a party's witness (probably even written down several formulaic examples for his witnesses)!  Or the need to avoid asking compound questions.  And yet, he did so repeatedly.  And then he objected when the defense counsel asked a leading question of the plaintiff's witness.  This is basic trial practice and, although even experienced attorneys can slip up at times, that part of the scripting was contrary to the persona of a neophyte attorney who is otherwise sharp and studious (i.e., it was comic bumbling).
