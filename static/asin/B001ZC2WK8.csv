1245760,AU6DTF15U4J27,B001ZC2WK8,BeeTee,"[27, 28]","As my title indicates, I gave up on waiting for this to come out in the US and ordered the series from the UK a year or so ago. I have a multi-region player, so it was a no-brainer. Waking the Dead is probably one of my favorite crime dramas of all time and this final season with all of the original cast is really stellar. Series 4, originally broadcast in the summer of 2004,  consists of 6 two-part episodes (really 12) and there isn't a dud among them. ""In the Sight of the Lord"" involves the investigation of the unsolved murder of a WWII conscientious objector. The motive behind this murder is a rather gut-wrenching crime. ""False Flag"" involves the team investigating the unsolved murder of an Irish terrorist missing since 1981. A bit tedious at times but still quite good and better than almost anything out there. In ""Fugue States"" the team is handed the case of a set of twins missing for 13 years until one of them shows up in an ER after a car accident. The side story here really starts to develop the character of Mel Silver as she searches for her biological mother. The two parter ""Anger Management"" has the team investigating a suicide at a half-way house with the kicker involving the weapon used. The side story here is a lot of fun as the perennially angry Boyd is forced to take anger management counselling, the effects of which his team find disturbing. In ""The Hardest Word"" the team is called in when two males are found with the word ""sorry"" carved into their backs. There is an organized crime tie-in so another team is brought in to help solve the case, creating tension and providing a female of interest for Boyd. The final set ""Shadowplay"" is really wonderfully done but has a truly heart-wrenching ending. The series was never quite the same after, although still good. This final season with all members of the original cast is extra special, maybe because it is the last, but most probably because the stories told are just that good.I wish it didn't take so long to get these released over here. If you have a multi-region player, you can get series 4 from Amazon UK for 10.98 which is roughly about $19.00. I have never been charged over $5 or $6 to ship things here and if you get a few other dvds, it might be worth it to order from Amazon UK--the conversion rate is quite good right now. Series 5 and 6 have been available since 2007/2008 in the UK. I also recommend the British series Silent Witness. Fans of WTD will probably enjoy it too.",5,Well Worth the Wait (Although I Didn't....),1256774400,"10 29, 2009",2009,2483,"['title', 'gave', 'up', 'waiting', 'come', 'out', 'US', 'ordered', 'series', 'UK', 'year', 'so', 'ago', 'have', 'multi-region', 'player', 'was', 'no-brainer', 'Waking', 'Dead', 'probably', 'one', 'favorite', 'crime', 'dramas', 'time', 'final', 'season', 'original', 'cast', 'really', 'stellar', 'Series', '4', 'originally', 'broadcast', 'summer', '2004', '6', 'two-part', 'episodes', 'really', '12', ""n't"", 'dud', 'Sight', 'Lord', 'investigation', 'unsolved', 'murder', 'WWII', 'conscientious', 'objector', 'motive', 'murder', 'rather', 'gut-wrenching', 'crime', 'False', 'Flag', 'team', 'investigating', 'unsolved', 'murder', 'Irish', 'terrorist', 'missing', '1981', 'bit', 'tedious', 'times', 'still', 'quite', 'good', 'better', 'almost', 'anything', 'out', 'there', 'Fugue', 'States', 'team', 'handed', 'case', 'set', 'twins', 'missing', '13', 'years', 'one', 'up', 'ER', 'car', 'accident', 'side', 'story', 'here', 'really', 'develop', 'character', 'Mel', 'Silver', 'biological', 'mother', 'two', 'parter', 'Anger', 'Management', 'team', 'investigating', 'suicide', 'half-way', 'house', 'kicker', 'involving', 'weapon', 'used', 'side', 'story', 'here', 'lot', 'fun', 'perennially', 'angry', 'Boyd', 'forced', 'take', 'anger', 'management', 'counselling', 'effects', 'team', 'find', 'disturbing', 'Hardest', 'Word', 'team', 'called', 'when', 'two', 'males', 'are', 'found', 'word', 'sorry', 'carved', 'backs', 'organized', 'crime', 'tie-in', 'team', 'brought', 'help', 'solve', 'case', 'creating', 'tension', 'providing', 'female', 'interest', 'Boyd', 'final', 'set', 'Shadowplay', 'really', 'wonderfully', 'done', 'truly', 'heart-wrenching', 'ending', 'series', 'was', 'never', 'quite', 'same', 'still', 'good', 'final', 'season', 'members', 'original', 'cast', 'extra', 'special', 'maybe', 'last', 'most', 'probably', 'stories', 'told', 'are', 'just', 'good.I', 'wish', 'did', ""n't"", 'take', 'so', 'long', 'get', 'released', 'here', 'have', 'multi-region', 'player', 'can', 'get', 'series', '4', 'Amazon', 'UK', '10.98', 'roughly', 'about', '19.00', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'charged', '5', '6', 'ship', 'things', 'here', 'get', 'few', 'other', 'dvds', 'might', 'be', 'worth', 'order', 'Amazon', 'UK', 'conversion', 'rate', 'quite', 'good', 'right', 'now', 'Series', '5', '6', 'have', 'been', 'available', '2007/2008', 'UK', 'also', 'recommend', 'British', 'series', 'Silent', 'Witness', 'Fans', 'WTD', 'will', 'probably', 'enjoy', 'too']",Waking The Dead - Series 4 [NON-U.S.A.

""Waking the Dead"" Season four (4) is really Television Entertainment at its very, very best.  I just loved this season.The episodes (6 in 2 parts on 3 discs with each part running over an hour) of Season four (4) of this series are so really great.  The acting, the writing and the direction of each episode are all simply superb.  I really don't know when I've been so well entertained.  Each episode was so good that it left me in awe.Be advised that the episodes in Season Four are intense with no obvious solutions to the mysteries. Yes, there is a tragedy to the Cold Case Unit that will affect the future operations (a ""cliff hanger"" perhaps?).

The plots seem quite original - probably because each show is in two parts so there is ample time to develop complexity and back story.  Boyd, the team leader for the cold cases, is showing development as a character and mellowing nicely. He is fairly magnetic as a character, a bit imperious, but warm and occasionally vulnerable. The ensemble works well together and by now you really know each team member - their strengths and peculiarities.Love to watch these while on the treadmill as the pacing is good and the plot has some intensity to make the time go by quickly.  Each show is quite distinct from the others and the endings are usually not predictable. I think the series just continues to get better and deepen.

The acting is on a superior level and Trevor Eve carries the show as a intense justice driven detective in charge of forgotten cases.  And he's backed up by a excellent cast that really put out first rate performances. The dead on this show really look like real dead people often too and the stories are extremely engaging. I would say it's one of my favorite british crime shows ever and that's saying alot.  The main problem is that the bbc is way behind on releasing these to our region.  This is series four from 2004 and they have already shot 8 seasons and will have another one in 2011 making it season 9 with perhaps even more in store.

1245771,A3RNP5X8ZGZIEI,B001ZC2WK8,Stephanie De Pue,"[0, 0]","""Waking the Dead Season 4""is a superb entry in the acclaimed British mystery television series that ran from 2000-2007, when, sadly, it was axed by the BBC in favor of `newer, more innovative crime dramas.' It played for some time on BBCAmerica on my side of the pond, where I made its acquaintance. It is strongly -cast and -written ---by Barbara Machin, a woman, yay! It's a police procedural/crime drama that follows Detective Superintendent Peter Boyd and his cold-case unit, consisting of scientists and a psychologist, as well as detectives, at the London Metropolitan Police. The squad utilizes the latest advances in forensic science, psychological profiling of the unknown criminal perpetrators and other modern investigative techniques to crack unsolved murders.Upon even initial viewing, its differences from similar-sounding American TV series are great. The cop shop is anything but new and shiny, and poorly lit compared to American series that all seem to have been filmed on a sunny Southern California set. The actors aren't new and shiny, either. Trevor Eve, (Heat of the Sun Boxed Set (Private Lives / Hide in Plain Sight / The Sport of Kings)) who plays Boyd, began his career as beefcake. But he's older now, and showing how thoughtfully he's aged. Still very watchable. He's backed, in the cop shop, by Sue Johnston as Dr. Grace Foley; Wil Johnson, as DI Spencer Jordan; Holly Aird as Dr. Frankie Wharton; and Claire Goose, as DS Amelia (Mel) Silver. All of them very good actors, and not one of them a beautiful young blond. The production also uses a number of excellent older British actors; in this series, notably older Celtic actors. It is violent, intense and suspenseful; plots are intricate and complex: there's always something going on. The episodes are:Disc 1. ""In Sight of the Lord,"" Parts 1 and 2. World War II misdeeds of a squad of out of control soldiers are punished unto the present day. Features Michael Byrne.""False Flag,"" Parts 1 and 2. A 20-year old case centering on a young Anglo-Irish terrorist. Or was he? Features Timothy West and Frances de la Tour.Disc 2. ""Fugue States,"" Parts 1 and 2. Centers on adoption issues. Cindy and Jason Murphy were abducted as five-year olds and never found. What's become of them? Features Sean McGinley.""Anger Management,"" Parts 1 and 2. Boyd is ordered into psychotherapy for his anger management problems. The squad investigates a purported suicide. Features T.P. McKenna.Disc 3. ""The Hardest Word,"" Parts 1 and 2. A look back at child abuse, and a killer who carves ""Sorry,"" into the backs of his victims while they are still alive. Features Julian Glover and Phyllida Law.""Shadow Play,"" Parts 1 and 2. A mysterious ""shepherd"" is pushing unstable, religiously-oriented young women into murder. Reaches a conclusion that shocks the cop shop, and will shock viewers as well.Solid and workmanlike this series surely is, but it's much more than that; under Machin's executive producership, it is the product of topnotch writers and directors, and makes for intense, riveting viewing.
