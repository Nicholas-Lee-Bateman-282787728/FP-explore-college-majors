994414,A24ZKGYGJU5GK7,B000FS2VWM,Amazon Customer,"[8, 12]","First off, as you probably know, this movie is a sequel to the Fullmetal Alchemist series, and as such, you need to have seen the series prior to the movie if you want to understand and appreciate the film. Unless you've seen the entire series (particularly the ending), you're not likely to really understand what's going on. That said, on with the review.The animation in this film is extremely well done - somewhat higher than the series. This unfortunately means that the tone of the movie is more serious than the series. There are certainly some jokes and the like, but most of the movie is quite serious.The dubbing is as great as ever (I can't say how good the Japanese voices were since I watched it in English). Even the new folks were well done. I really think that the dubbing for Fullmetal Alchemist is among the best in the business.All the main characters are back, but due to the short length of the film, we only see some of them briefly. The movie focuses primarily on Ed and Al - particularly Ed.The plot is good, but I really think that it could have used more time. The movie moves along fairly quickly, putting all of the pieces in place for the conclusion, but not going into great detail. What they did was well executed, but somewhat rushed and thus shallow. They could have easily produced an entire season of the show based on the plot in this movie, but instead we get this short movie.I would have definitely given this movie 4 stars - maybe 4 1/2 (it's too short to get 5), but I REALLY don't like the ending. I found it to be highly disappointing. I won't spoil it, but I'd expect a lot of FMA fans to be disappointed by it. It arguably wraps everything up, but leaves enough open that they could make more FMA if they wanted to. Unfortunately, from what I hear, there are no plans to make more Fullmetal Alchemist.All in all, this film is definitely worth watching for any FMA fan. However, I think that the ending really leaves something to be desired. Personaly, it's the first time in quite a while that I've actually been angry after seeing the end of a movie",3,"Well done, but it would have done better as an entire season",1163635200,"11 16, 2006",2006,2095,"['First', 'off', 'probably', 'know', 'movie', 'sequel', 'Fullmetal', 'Alchemist', 'series', 'such', 'need', 'have', 'seen', 'series', 'prior', 'movie', 'want', 'understand', 'appreciate', 'film', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'entire', 'series', 'particularly', 'ending', ""'re"", 'not', 'likely', 'really', 'understand', 'what', 'going', 'said', 'review.The', 'animation', 'film', 'extremely', 'well', 'done', 'somewhat', 'higher', 'series', 'unfortunately', 'tone', 'movie', 'more', 'serious', 'series', 'are', 'certainly', 'jokes', 'like', 'most', 'movie', 'quite', 'serious.The', 'dubbing', 'as', 'great', 'ever', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'how', 'good', 'Japanese', 'voices', 'were', 'watched', 'English', 'Even', 'new', 'folks', 'were', 'well', 'done', 'really', 'think', 'dubbing', 'Fullmetal', 'Alchemist', 'best', 'business.All', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'back', 'due', 'short', 'length', 'film', 'only', 'see', 'briefly', 'movie', 'primarily', 'Ed', 'Al', 'particularly', 'Ed.The', 'plot', 'good', 'really', 'think', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'more', 'time', 'movie', 'along', 'fairly', 'quickly', 'putting', 'pieces', 'place', 'conclusion', 'not', 'going', 'great', 'detail', 'What', 'did', 'was', 'well', 'executed', 'somewhat', 'rushed', 'thus', 'shallow', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'produced', 'entire', 'season', 'show', 'based', 'plot', 'movie', 'instead', 'get', 'short', 'movie.I', 'would', 'have', 'definitely', 'given', 'movie', '4', 'stars', 'maybe', '4', '1/2', 'too', 'short', 'get', '5', 'REALLY', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'ending', 'found', 'be', 'highly', 'disappointing', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', ""'d"", 'expect', 'lot', 'FMA', 'fans', 'be', 'disappointed', 'arguably', 'wraps', 'everything', 'up', 'enough', 'open', 'could', 'make', 'more', 'FMA', 'wanted', 'Unfortunately', 'what', 'hear', 'are', 'plans', 'make', 'more', 'Fullmetal', 'Alchemist.All', 'film', 'definitely', 'worth', 'watching', 'FMA', 'fan', 'However', 'think', 'ending', 'really', 'something', 'be', 'desired', 'Personaly', 'first', 'time', 'quite', 'while', ""'ve"", 'actually', 'been', 'angry', 'seeing', 'end', 'movie']",N/A

994416,A18JORXY0YARAX,B000FS2VWM,Anne with an e,"[2, 8]","My biggest complaint about this movie and the reason I gave it such a low score all revolves the setting, which also happens to be major motivation factor for 75% of the characters of the movie, I feel compelled to reveal that I was vastly, VASTLY disappointed with the plot twist revealed at the the end of the tv show; that the alchemical gate leads to an alternate universe , IE the historically identical to our own or ""real"" world, mostly because taken in context of the setting of the rest of the series, it doesn't make sense: not geographically, not historically, and not in terms of how the mechanics of alchemy work according to this twist.  Just for starters, Eastern Europe isn't well known for its vast deserts, a religion that is 15 centuries old and followed by almost everyone on one continent, half of another, and large chunks of a third at the time when the two realities split hardly qualifies as an easily dropped ""cult"" as Dante terms it in the series, and if the souls of the real world fuel alchemy in one world, then what do the dead of the other world fuel in the real world? Another flaw in the stupid mechanics of alternate world death fuel: how is alchemy supposed to work for the Thule society again if there's no alchemy in the real world? And DON'T say ""physics"" because the basic laws of physics clearly exist in the FMA universe as well.  Also, why would Ed, all limbs intact, cross the gate completely and show up on the other side missing limbs again?  That's never really explained.ANYway, setting all that aside, what about the movie itself?  Well, it, ah . . . kinda blows.  The plot is clunky, character motivations are shaky, and I never understood why the Thule society thought that the alternate world would be paradise.  They had Hohenhiem right there to tell them that actually it was just as war torn and messed up as their own reality.  And they knew about the power of alchemy in that other world.  What made them think they'd have any chance at world domination when they didn't even know how to control, fight with or defend against the most powerful weapons that alternate world had to offer?This will seem silly, but my second biggest complaint is Al's outfit.  Did he find Ed's old wardrobe?  Couldn't they give the poor kid his own set of clothes and not make him a clone and a painful/confusing reminder to all those for whom Ed is basically dead?  I know he lacks four years of memories and physical development, but that's no excuse.  Why does he have to have the same outfit as Ed?  It's lazy.  It's a stupid thing to be annoyed by, but I didn't need the red coat to remind me that I'm watching an FMA spin off.  I'm not even going to start on his ability to transmute without a circle when he doesn't remember the gate, the knowledge and memory of which is clearly shown to be the enabler of said ability.  So also, I guess there are some plot holes.On the whole, the movie just raises more questions than it answers, which since it is a series ender is kind of a problem. The only thing it really resolves is whether Ed and Al ever get to meet again. (Spoiler alert: yes.)  Oh, and also I guess you learn how the characters who die end up.  And where all that blood comes from.On the plus side the animation is pretty good.  So there's that.

994417,A3OCO2VYXPPJ9W,B000FS2VWM,"Any - Ren He ""Princess Kiara""","[5, 6]","After I have finished watching the TV series of ""Fullmetal Alchemist"", I have been expecting for this movie ""Conqueror of Shamballa"" and watched it in May Day this year. I have to admit that this is a glorious movie of Japanese animation, and even I can say it's the best one I have ever seen.At the beginning of this movie, I was a little wondering that why Alphonse maintain his armour form. Then as the story went on, I knew that this movie was shown in flashback. I love this kind of method, it made us recalled something old in TV series and led us into an all-new adventure. It attracted me at once. The stories of this movie is wonderful, all the plots were attractive, and all the suspenses have been set perfectly. The stories have been set on the background that the World War 2, it made the fable story very authentic. To a very extent, the history of World War 2 that we are familiar to was in this movie, so this movie is easy to be accepted by many people. Besides, similarly to the TV series, this movie is full-filled with courage, bravery and love.Secondly, the wonderful tableaux are what attracted me much. At first, I didn't think the quality of tableaux was better than that in the TV series. But after I watched the movie for several times, I found it's more technical than the TV series. Some 3D and other kinds of techniques were in the making of this movie. For example, the armours appeared from the ground, the movement of them seemed so smooth and natural. And, many of the scenes have appeared in the TV series, but the excellent technique of this movie made them more beautiful and colorful. In my opinion, tableaux in this movie is one of the focuses.Thirdly, characters of this movie were what I paid most of my attention to, either old or new. All the old characters performed perfectly in this movie, especially the Elric brothers of course. Alphonse is my favorite character, and he became more handsome in this movie, he resembled this brother Edward. I love Edward in this movie, but he often seemed so mopish in the movie. However, when he reunited with his brother, he became more spirited. Wrath is my favorite Homunculus, he seemed very different from how he used to be in the TV series, I was surprised that he helped Alphonse in opening the door. My favorite new character in this movie is Alphonse Heiderich, it's not only because he looked like Alphonse Elric but also because of his kindness, wisdom and courage. But it's really a pity that this young man was killed. My friends and I all consider that he's the most tragic character in the movie. I think many of fans have been expecting for the evolvement between Roy and Riza. We could see that Riza's attachment to Roy hasn't faded at all, but there was only a little dialogue between them. However, I felt very happy for them that they met each other again.Finally, I think the ending of this movie was expected much, because this movie is the sequel of the TV series. At first, I thought the ending of this movie would be a perfect and happy one that would surprise us much. I think I would feel happy that the Elric brother reunited finally, but I didn't know why I still felt very regretful. After I watched the movie, every time when I watched the TV series and see Winry was with the Elric brothers, I feel sorry for her. At the end, she would never see her friends again. When I saw her sorrowful face as soon as she saw Edward went to the other world, I felt so sad that my tears almost fell. Maybe that's why I feel regretful for the ending.I think this is really a great movie and a wonderful sequel of the TV series, though I was not very satisfied with the ending. This movie has an lamented ending, but if it was a perfect and happy one, it would stray away from the theme of ""Fullmetal Alchemist"" and it wouldn't be so impressing. However, I still wish that the door could be opened again and everyone who loved each othe so much could all reunited, skipping a cruel war of course...",5,"Glorious movie, wonderful sequel of the TV series!",1159660800,"10 1, 2006",2006,3997,"['have', 'finished', 'watching', 'TV', 'series', 'Fullmetal', 'Alchemist', 'have', 'been', 'expecting', 'movie', 'Conqueror', 'Shamballa', 'watched', 'May', 'Day', 'year', 'have', 'admit', 'glorious', 'movie', 'Japanese', 'animation', 'even', 'can', 'say', 'best', 'one', 'have', 'ever', 'seen.At', 'beginning', 'movie', 'was', 'little', 'wondering', 'why', 'Alphonse', 'maintain', 'armour', 'form', 'Then', 'story', 'went', 'knew', 'movie', 'was', 'shown', 'flashback', 'love', 'kind', 'method', 'made', 'recalled', 'something', 'old', 'TV', 'series', 'led', 'all-new', 'adventure', 'attracted', 'once', 'stories', 'movie', 'wonderful', 'plots', 'were', 'attractive', 'suspenses', 'have', 'been', 'set', 'perfectly', 'stories', 'have', 'been', 'set', 'background', 'World', 'War', '2', 'made', 'fable', 'story', 'very', 'authentic', 'very', 'extent', 'history', 'World', 'War', '2', 'are', 'familiar', 'was', 'movie', 'movie', 'easy', 'be', 'accepted', 'many', 'people', 'similarly', 'TV', 'series', 'movie', 'full-filled', 'courage', 'bravery', 'love.Secondly', 'wonderful', 'tableaux', 'are', 'what', 'attracted', 'much', 'first', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'quality', 'tableaux', 'was', 'better', 'TV', 'series', 'watched', 'movie', 'several', 'times', 'found', 'more', 'technical', 'TV', 'series', '3D', 'other', 'kinds', 'techniques', 'were', 'making', 'movie', 'example', 'armours', 'appeared', 'ground', 'movement', 'seemed', 'so', 'smooth', 'natural', 'many', 'scenes', 'have', 'appeared', 'TV', 'series', 'excellent', 'technique', 'movie', 'made', 'more', 'beautiful', 'colorful', 'opinion', 'tableaux', 'movie', 'one', 'focuses.Thirdly', 'characters', 'movie', 'were', 'what', 'paid', 'most', 'attention', 'either', 'old', 'new', 'old', 'characters', 'performed', 'perfectly', 'movie', 'especially', 'Elric', 'brothers', 'course', 'Alphonse', 'favorite', 'character', 'became', 'more', 'handsome', 'movie', 'resembled', 'brother', 'Edward', 'love', 'Edward', 'movie', 'often', 'seemed', 'so', 'mopish', 'movie', 'However', 'when', 'reunited', 'brother', 'became', 'more', 'spirited', 'Wrath', 'favorite', 'Homunculus', 'seemed', 'very', 'different', 'how', 'used', 'be', 'TV', 'series', 'was', 'surprised', 'helped', 'Alphonse', 'opening', 'door', 'favorite', 'new', 'character', 'movie', 'Alphonse', 'Heiderich', 'not', 'only', 'looked', 'Alphonse', 'Elric', 'also', 'kindness', 'wisdom', 'courage', 'really', 'pity', 'young', 'man', 'was', 'killed', 'friends', 'consider', 'most', 'tragic', 'character', 'movie', 'think', 'many', 'fans', 'have', 'been', 'expecting', 'evolvement', 'Roy', 'Riza', 'could', 'see', 'Riza', 'attachment', 'Roy', ""n't"", 'faded', 'there', 'was', 'only', 'little', 'dialogue', 'However', 'felt', 'very', 'happy', 'met', 'other', 'again.Finally', 'think', 'ending', 'movie', 'was', 'expected', 'much', 'movie', 'sequel', 'TV', 'series', 'first', 'thought', 'ending', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'perfect', 'happy', 'one', 'would', 'surprise', 'much', 'think', 'would', 'feel', 'happy', 'Elric', 'brother', 'reunited', 'finally', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'still', 'felt', 'very', 'regretful', 'watched', 'movie', 'time', 'when', 'watched', 'TV', 'series', 'see', 'Winry', 'was', 'Elric', 'brothers', 'feel', 'sorry', 'end', 'would', 'never', 'see', 'friends', 'again', 'When', 'saw', 'sorrowful', 'face', 'as', 'soon', 'saw', 'Edward', 'went', 'other', 'world', 'felt', 'so', 'sad', 'tears', 'almost', 'fell', 'Maybe', 'why', 'feel', 'regretful', 'ending.I', 'think', 'really', 'great', 'movie', 'wonderful', 'sequel', 'TV', 'series', 'was', 'not', 'very', 'satisfied', 'ending', 'movie', 'lamented', 'ending', 'was', 'perfect', 'happy', 'one', 'would', 'stray', 'away', 'theme', 'Fullmetal', 'Alchemist', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'so', 'impressing', 'However', 'still', 'wish', 'door', 'could', 'be', 'opened', 'again', 'everyone', 'who', 'loved', 'othe', 'so', 'much', 'could', 'all', 'reunited', 'skipping', 'cruel', 'war', 'course']",N/A

994420,A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B000FS2VWM,"Cloud ""...""","[9, 9]","Similar to End of Evangelion, this film is essentially the conclusion to the 51-episode anime show that caught on big with audiences stateside. While it's not a fair comparison, that was my first thought that came to mind, especially since like EoE, Conqueror doesn't end with an ""all questions answered"" ending. While it's definately cool to see your favorite characters in a fuller context, there's some things that aren't dealt with, mainly with characters, that I wish they concluded. In case you haven't seen the series, I am going to spoil it so consider yourself warned.At the end of the series, 4 Homunculi had been killed with one being sent through the Gate. Al had been restored to his body with his memory wiped out and Ed was in our world circa the 1920's in Munich, Germany. In this film, Ed rescues a gypsy named Noah who has mind-reading abilities. It also turns out she's being hunted by the Thule Society who wants to reach the world ""Shamballa"". Back in the series world, Al actually turned out to be a pretty powerful alchemist and has been trying to find Ed while dealing with a new villain.One of the things that's always fun while watching these movies is seeing one of the old characters show up. I don't want to spoil it but some of them are like ""hey! that's him/her!"". But like certain movies that have the same back and forth structure, you start to get intrigued by the appearance of characters in one world then you jump back to someone else. It's only a minor nitpick so it isn't as important. But it is great to see the characters again.Now where I guess the disappointment comes in is the handling of certain characters. There's obviously some romances that are suggested such as Mustang/Hawkeye, Ed and Winry(and even at one point Ed and Rose), Scar and Lust and you'd at least like to see some acknowledgement of one of them actually happen. And the conclusion of the film suggests there will be a sequel since there's obviously stuff that can be resolved. I haven't read a single manga of the show, not that we have it available here anyway, so I have no clue what happens at the end.It's highly recommended that you watch the series as everything from transmutation circles to Homunculi will be completely lost. Sure you'll understand the basics but all the small details will be completely lost. The film's great so it's not that big of a problem but still, it's a big investment to watch the film so set some time to watch all 51 episodes then come here.",5,A fitting end to a great series,1158192000,"09 14, 2006",2006,2493,"['Similar', 'End', 'Evangelion', 'film', 'essentially', 'conclusion', '51-episode', 'anime', 'show', 'caught', 'big', 'audiences', 'stateside', 'not', 'fair', 'comparison', 'was', 'first', 'thought', 'came', 'mind', 'especially', 'EoE', 'Conqueror', ""n't"", 'end', 'questions', 'answered', 'ending', 'definately', 'cool', 'see', 'favorite', 'characters', 'fuller', 'context', 'things', 'are', ""n't"", 'dealt', 'mainly', 'characters', 'wish', 'concluded', 'case', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'series', 'am', 'going', 'spoil', 'so', 'consider', 'end', 'series', '4', 'Homunculi', 'had', 'been', 'killed', 'one', 'being', 'sent', 'Gate', 'Al', 'had', 'been', 'restored', 'body', 'memory', 'wiped', 'out', 'Ed', 'was', 'world', '1920', 'Munich', 'Germany', 'film', 'Ed', 'gypsy', 'named', 'Noah', 'who', 'mind-reading', 'abilities', 'also', 'out', 'being', 'hunted', 'Thule', 'Society', 'who', 'reach', 'world', 'Shamballa', 'Back', 'series', 'world', 'Al', 'actually', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'pretty', 'powerful', 'alchemist', 'been', 'trying', 'find', 'Ed', 'dealing', 'new', 'villain.One', 'things', 'always', 'fun', 'watching', 'movies', 'seeing', 'one', 'old', 'characters', 'show', 'up', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'spoil', 'are', 'hey', 'him/her', 'certain', 'movies', 'have', 'same', 'back', 'forth', 'structure', 'start', 'get', 'intrigued', 'appearance', 'characters', 'one', 'world', 'then', 'jump', 'back', 'someone', 'else', 'only', 'minor', 'nitpick', ""n't"", 'as', 'important', 'great', 'see', 'characters', 'again.Now', 'where', 'guess', 'disappointment', 'handling', 'certain', 'characters', 'obviously', 'romances', 'are', 'suggested', 'such', 'Mustang/Hawkeye', 'Ed', 'Winry', 'even', 'one', 'point', 'Ed', 'Rose', 'Scar', 'Lust', ""'d"", 'least', 'see', 'acknowledgement', 'one', 'actually', 'happen', 'conclusion', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'sequel', 'obviously', 'stuff', 'can', 'be', 'resolved', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'single', 'manga', 'show', 'not', 'have', 'available', 'here', 'anyway', 'have', 'clue', 'what', 'end.It', 'highly', 'recommended', 'watch', 'series', 'everything', 'transmutation', 'circles', 'Homunculi', 'will', 'be', 'completely', 'lost', 'Sure', ""'ll"", 'understand', 'basics', 'small', 'details', 'will', 'be', 'completely', 'lost', 'film', 'great', 'not', 'big', 'problem', 'still', 'big', 'investment', 'watch', 'film', 'so', 'set', 'time', 'watch', '51', 'episodes', 'then', 'come', 'here']",N/A

Ed finds himself in the middle of a plot that could drag both worlds down. Al the younger brother has been unlocking new secrets of alchemy and gaining new power in the hopes of finding Ed. Can Ed and Al find a way to reunite without causing chaos, or will the world of alchemy and the world of modern science collide?

You must watch the anime to even have the faintest idea of what is going on.That said, I love the anime and decided to purchase this movie to give me the resolution I needed after the final episode.  I must admit, it doesn't have the perfectly wrapped happy ending that I hoped for - but that's part of the whole point.  The world isn't perfect (something that both Ed and Al comment on) and the resolution of their story lines isn't immediately perfect, but after thinking about it, there was no better resolution.I wish there would have been a little less of the ""set up"" and a lot more ""alchemy action"" but still, a very enjoyable movie overall.

994423,ARNEUO7BF3J55,B000FS2VWM,E. David Swan,"[0, 4]","Back in the mid-90's I really got into buying Anime. In fact I was into Japanese animation even before it became regularly available on VHS tapes. After several years I quit picking them up because I seemed to be stumbling across more misses than hits. Some were quite spectacular but an unfortunate amount were mediocre, bland and derivative and the worst thing was that Anime tended to be on the expensive side. There were a few specific directors that I continued to support including Miyazaki and Otomo but even Otomo let me down with Steamboy. Recently I felt the Anime bug again and decided to try my luck. Unlike before I had quite a few resources available to research the quality of an Anime before purchasing it. Fullmetal Alchemist looked like the most appealing being highly rated, top selling and low priced. Maybe I set my expectations too high but it failed to live up to my hopes.The animation is a mixed bag. Sometimes it's quite beautiful and other times it reverts to a very silly cartoonish style. Overall I give the art mostly high marks but it seemed to lack a certain spark or pizzazz. My biggest problem was with the plot. The Thule society (a real life group that worked with the Nazi's) has discovered a gate between our world (or at least something close to it) and the world of Fullmetal Alchemist, also known as Amestris. Dietlinde Eckhart, the Thule society leader and movie's antagonist, mistakenly believes the portal leads to Shamballa, the mythical Tibetan kingdom in the Himalayas. At this point things started to fall apart. First of all there is no `Conqueror of Shamballa' because there is no Shamballa just Amestris and technically the Thule society doesn't even try and conquer it. Second, the Thule society's plot seems dubious at best. The plan is to raid Amestris in order to grab technology or mystical weapons they can use to support the fledgling Nazi party. Oddly enough the Thule society already has some pretty stunning resources including rocketry that shouldn't have been available for another 20 years, automatic guns and armor that seems to mix technology and magic.So if the Thule society already has this kind of fantastic weaponry why bother with parallel worlds and if Amestris has even better technology wont the Thule army just get decimated. Well, yes. That is exactly what happens. This first raid is easily taken care of by young Alphonse Elric single-handedly. The second raid is much larger but the slow moving armored warriors are no match for the much faster and more powerful Alchemists of Amestris. I don't want to give away the ending but the plan of the Thule society was ill conceived and doomed from the start.As someone who has never seen a single episode of Fullmetal Alchemist I found the movie frequently confusing. Probably the coolest battle in the movie was the one between a character named Wrath and a creature named Gluttony. Unfortunately I never saw these characters before or after the battle and have no idea what the fight was all about. It looked dramatic and the main character Edward Elric was present but I have no idea how it tied into the rest of the movie. The biggest crime committed by this movie is that it just isn't memorable. As the main villain Eckhart has nothing interesting going for her. The movie is good but never really reaches the level of great and it will likely sit on my shelf collecting dust. This one would have been better as a rental.",3,Probably better as a rental,1195084800,"11 15, 2007",2007,3451,"['Back', 'mid-90', 'really', 'got', 'buying', 'Anime', 'fact', 'was', 'Japanese', 'animation', 'even', 'became', 'regularly', 'available', 'VHS', 'tapes', 'several', 'years', 'quit', 'picking', 'seemed', 'be', 'stumbling', 'more', 'misses', 'hits', 'were', 'quite', 'spectacular', 'unfortunate', 'amount', 'were', 'mediocre', 'bland', 'derivative', 'worst', 'thing', 'was', 'Anime', 'tended', 'be', 'expensive', 'side', 'were', 'few', 'specific', 'directors', 'continued', 'support', 'including', 'Miyazaki', 'Otomo', 'even', 'Otomo', 'let', 'down', 'Steamboy', 'Recently', 'felt', 'Anime', 'bug', 'again', 'decided', 'try', 'luck', 'had', 'quite', 'few', 'resources', 'available', 'research', 'quality', 'Anime', 'purchasing', 'Fullmetal', 'Alchemist', 'looked', 'most', 'appealing', 'being', 'highly', 'rated', 'top', 'selling', 'low', 'priced', 'Maybe', 'set', 'expectations', 'too', 'high', 'failed', 'live', 'up', 'hopes.The', 'animation', 'mixed', 'bag', 'quite', 'beautiful', 'other', 'times', 'very', 'silly', 'cartoonish', 'style', 'Overall', 'give', 'art', 'mostly', 'high', 'marks', 'seemed', 'lack', 'certain', 'spark', 'pizzazz', 'biggest', 'problem', 'was', 'plot', 'Thule', 'society', 'real', 'life', 'group', 'worked', 'Nazi', 'discovered', 'gate', 'world', 'least', 'something', 'close', 'world', 'Fullmetal', 'Alchemist', 'also', 'known', 'Amestris', 'Dietlinde', 'Eckhart', 'Thule', 'society', 'leader', 'movie', 'antagonist', 'mistakenly', 'portal', 'Shamballa', 'mythical', 'Tibetan', 'kingdom', 'Himalayas', 'point', 'things', 'started', 'fall', 'apart', 'First', 'Conqueror', 'Shamballa', 'Shamballa', 'just', 'Amestris', 'technically', 'Thule', 'society', ""n't"", 'even', 'try', 'conquer', 'Second', 'Thule', 'society', 'plot', 'dubious', 'best', 'plan', 'raid', 'Amestris', 'order', 'grab', 'technology', 'mystical', 'weapons', 'can', 'use', 'support', 'fledgling', 'Nazi', 'party', 'Oddly', 'Thule', 'society', 'already', 'pretty', 'stunning', 'resources', 'including', 'rocketry', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'available', '20', 'years', 'automatic', 'guns', 'armor', 'mix', 'technology', 'magic.So', 'Thule', 'society', 'already', 'kind', 'fantastic', 'weaponry', 'why', 'bother', 'parallel', 'worlds', 'Amestris', 'even', 'better', 'technology', 'Thule', 'army', 'just', 'get', 'decimated', 'Well', 'yes', 'exactly', 'what', 'first', 'raid', 'easily', 'taken', 'care', 'young', 'Alphonse', 'Elric', 'single-handedly', 'second', 'raid', 'much', 'larger', 'slow', 'moving', 'armored', 'warriors', 'are', 'match', 'much', 'faster', 'more', 'powerful', 'Alchemists', 'Amestris', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'away', 'ending', 'plan', 'Thule', 'society', 'was', 'ill', 'conceived', 'doomed', 'start.As', 'someone', 'who', 'never', 'seen', 'single', 'episode', 'Fullmetal', 'Alchemist', 'found', 'movie', 'frequently', 'confusing', 'Probably', 'coolest', 'battle', 'movie', 'was', 'one', 'character', 'named', 'Wrath', 'creature', 'named', 'Gluttony', 'Unfortunately', 'never', 'saw', 'characters', 'battle', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'fight', 'was', 'looked', 'dramatic', 'main', 'character', 'Edward', 'Elric', 'was', 'present', 'have', 'idea', 'how', 'tied', 'rest', 'movie', 'biggest', 'crime', 'committed', 'movie', 'just', ""n't"", 'memorable', 'main', 'villain', 'Eckhart', 'nothing', 'interesting', 'going', 'movie', 'good', 'never', 'really', 'level', 'great', 'will', 'likely', 'sit', 'shelf', 'collecting', 'dust', 'one', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'rental']",N/A

I didn't know much about FMA and wanted to ""sample"" it to see if I liked the characters and the universe, before committing to watching the 50+ episode FMA or the 60+ episode FMA:Brotherhood.

It got me sufficiently invested to watch both the series (devoting many many hours of my life to this mega-enterprise). Looking back, I would recommend any new Hagaren-nut to watch FMA first, then this movie, Conqueror of Shamballa, then FMA:Brotherhood.

994445,ACFZ53LQVMXCE,B000FS2VWM,Kay One,"[0, 1]","If you go back and read my other reviews about FMA and the sequel series FMA:Brotherhood, I make my difference in opinion about the two series very clear. The original FMA series follows the existing manga at the time of the series broadcast leading to a story faithful to the manga storyline up to the series midpoint, then the producers ran out of material and had to create their own storyline from that point on. While it is not a bad story in it's own respect it comes across more like convoluted fan fiction than something that would have come from manga author Arakawa's mind. The ending of the series leaves many plot & character arcs unresolved and creates the interesting premise that the world of FMA and Alchemy is a parallel universe to our own reality/Earth and the Gate of Truth allows access between these two worlds. Ok, this is completely different from where the manga goes, but that's ok. It's a good and creative idea.The FMA movie: Conqueror of Shamballa sets out to resolve this storyline ultimately now focusing on a human Alphonse on the FMA world who has taken up the mantle of his missing brother while on our Earth in 1920s era Germany, Ed continues to work and research to find a way back to his own world. Ed encounters new allies an enemies as well as getting caught up in a plot by future Nazi's who seek to use this lost art of Alchemy to force open a gateway into Ed's world and plan an invasion which Ed must stop. Can the brother's stop this evil plan and be reunited again?The ending of this film has and will leave a lot of fans of the original series with mixed feelings and compared to the resolution of the FMA:Brotherhood story, it is absolutely weak in comparison.Onto the disc and features itself, the animation is absolutely gorgeous, top notch and you can tell a lot of money was put into this film's production with a very nice HD transfer to bluray with crisp and clear colors and detail. Bluray extras are limited to extra commentary tracks in english and japanese as well as some trailers for the film.The Conqueror of Shamballa was a fair effort to resolve the honestly messed up conclusion of the original TV series and even if FMA:Brotherhood didn't exist, I would say this was a decent film, but not really be compelled to rewatch it.",2,A good effort to end a flawed series...,1307836800,"06 12, 2011",2011,2288,"['go', 'back', 'read', 'other', 'reviews', 'FMA', 'sequel', 'series', 'FMA', 'Brotherhood', 'make', 'difference', 'opinion', 'two', 'series', 'very', 'clear', 'original', 'FMA', 'series', 'existing', 'manga', 'time', 'series', 'broadcast', 'leading', 'story', 'faithful', 'manga', 'series', 'midpoint', 'then', 'producers', 'ran', 'material', 'had', 'create', 'own', 'storyline', 'point', 'not', 'bad', 'story', 'own', 'respect', 'more', 'convoluted', 'fan', 'fiction', 'something', 'would', 'have', 'come', 'manga', 'author', 'Arakawa', 'mind', 'ending', 'series', 'many', 'plot', 'character', 'arcs', 'unresolved', 'interesting', 'premise', 'world', 'FMA', 'Alchemy', 'parallel', 'universe', 'own', 'reality/Earth', 'Gate', 'Truth', 'access', 'two', 'worlds', 'Ok', 'completely', 'different', 'where', 'manga', 'ok', 'good', 'creative', 'idea.The', 'FMA', 'movie', 'Conqueror', 'Shamballa', 'out', 'resolve', 'storyline', 'ultimately', 'now', 'focusing', 'human', 'Alphonse', 'FMA', 'world', 'who', 'taken', 'up', 'mantle', 'missing', 'brother', 'Earth', '1920s', 'era', 'Germany', 'Ed', 'work', 'research', 'find', 'way', 'back', 'own', 'world', 'Ed', 'new', 'allies', 'enemies', 'as', 'well', 'getting', 'caught', 'up', 'plot', 'future', 'Nazi', 'who', 'seek', 'use', 'lost', 'art', 'Alchemy', 'force', 'open', 'gateway', 'Ed', 'world', 'plan', 'invasion', 'Ed', 'must', 'stop', 'Can', 'brother', 'stop', 'evil', 'plan', 'be', 'reunited', 'again', 'ending', 'film', 'will', 'leave', 'lot', 'fans', 'original', 'series', 'mixed', 'feelings', 'compared', 'resolution', 'FMA', 'Brotherhood', 'story', 'absolutely', 'weak', 'comparison.Onto', 'disc', 'animation', 'absolutely', 'gorgeous', 'top', 'notch', 'can', 'tell', 'lot', 'money', 'was', 'put', 'film', 'production', 'very', 'nice', 'HD', 'transfer', 'bluray', 'crisp', 'clear', 'colors', 'detail', 'Bluray', 'extras', 'are', 'limited', 'extra', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'english', 'japanese', 'as', 'well', 'trailers', 'film.The', 'Conqueror', 'Shamballa', 'was', 'fair', 'effort', 'resolve', 'honestly', 'messed', 'up', 'conclusion', 'original', 'TV', 'series', 'even', 'FMA', 'Brotherhood', 'did', ""n't"", 'exist', 'would', 'say', 'was', 'decent', 'film', 'not', 'really', 'be', 'compelled', 'rewatch']",N/A
994446,A7X33R976MR9L,B000FS2VWM,L. A Walsh,"[7, 7]","(EDIT--Jan 2008: I've rewatched the entire series and watched this film again 2 or 3 times--and liked it far more on subsequential watchings--I would now give it a 4 star simply because I love the characters so much--but my complaints about its weakenesses still stand. I will say that I've watched it in both English and Japanese and I applaud both Romi Pak and Vic Mignogna for their outstanding performances as Edward. It's still muddled and could do with serious re-editing--but I've come to love it after seeing it again._)Fullmetal Alchemist,in my opinion, is one of the most gripping, emotionally charged and memorable anime series of all time. It's not just good anime--it's good storytelling with characters you grow deeply concerned for. Even in the weaker 'filler' episodes are still worth watching. I rented the first three discs of the series and then purchased the imported box set with the movie--and believe me, I wouldn't invest that kind of cash if I didn't think FMA was a classic. The day after I finally viewed Episode 51 I sat down to watch the move, still stunned, shaken and moved by what I'd seen in the final episode......And I came away from the movie thinking how there was simply too much story, too many scenes that didn't propel the action forward. The subplot with the Rose-lookalike, Noah, as the psychic who figures out Edward's secret past could have been edited out completely and nobody would have missed it, as would have much of the Fritz Lang material (as a film buff I did appreciate the sly references to his wife, Thea Von Harbou, who was a dedicated follower of Hitler--their movie 'Metropolis' is the science fiction film Lang keeps refering to). All in all, the historical parts could have been pared back--most of us know enough about 20th century history that we don't need all the pointed references.As for the Amestris characters--seeing Roy Mustang falling completely into his depression and self loathing (a key subplot in the series) only to rise to the occasion, recover his belief in himself and to take command once more provides some of the strongest scenes in the film. His brief reunion with Ed and Al suddenly shifts the movie into high gear--it develops a terrific Indiana Jones-type energy with sharp dialog and comedy/action timing that SHOULD have set the tone for the film. When Edward snaps, ""Love the eyepatch. Pity it isn't over your mouth."" I wanted to cheer. Classic ""Taisa and the Shrimp"" sparring that kicks both characters back on course. And of course, Armstrong steals every scene he poses in, sparkles and all.Is this the end of FMA? Good question. There have been a few short OVA's out there, but nothing on the scope of the original series. The manga is still running strong.The truth is, there was so much potential in this film--we know and love these characters, share their history--we want to know what happens next to Al and Ed as their journey continues. The fact that there was no GUARANTEE that the Gate was sealed could potentially leave the door open for more films...who knows? Studio Bones indicates that FMA anime is officially completed. If you watch the documentary with the disc you'll see that this original script was originally over 100 pages long and could have been made into a second series. I just wish the final hurrah had been better edited--it should have been a tighter, more exciting film. Still, it's definitely worth seeing.",3,It amost works...still worth seeing,1162512000,"11 3, 2006",2006,3433,"['EDIT', 'Jan', '2008', ""'ve"", 'rewatched', 'entire', 'series', 'watched', 'film', 'again', '2', '3', 'times', 'liked', 'far', 'more', 'subsequential', 'watchings', 'would', 'now', 'give', '4', 'star', 'simply', 'love', 'characters', 'so', 'much', 'complaints', 'weakenesses', 'still', 'stand', 'will', 'say', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'English', 'Japanese', 'applaud', 'Romi', 'Pak', 'Vic', 'Mignogna', 'outstanding', 'performances', 'Edward', 'still', 'muddled', 'could', 'do', 'serious', 're-editing', ""'ve"", 'come', 'love', 'seeing', 'again._', 'Fullmetal', 'Alchemist', 'opinion', 'one', 'most', 'gripping', 'emotionally', 'charged', 'memorable', 'anime', 'series', 'time', 'not', 'just', 'good', 'anime', 'good', 'storytelling', 'characters', 'grow', 'deeply', 'concerned', 'Even', 'weaker', 'episodes', 'are', 'still', 'worth', 'watching', 'rented', 'first', 'three', 'discs', 'series', 'then', 'purchased', 'imported', 'box', 'set', 'movie', 'believe', 'would', ""n't"", 'invest', 'kind', 'cash', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'FMA', 'was', 'classic', 'day', 'finally', 'viewed', 'Episode', '51', 'sat', 'down', 'watch', 'move', 'still', 'stunned', 'shaken', 'moved', 'what', ""'d"", 'seen', 'final', 'episode', 'came', 'away', 'movie', 'thinking', 'how', 'was', 'simply', 'too', 'much', 'story', 'too', 'many', 'scenes', 'did', ""n't"", 'propel', 'action', 'forward', 'subplot', 'Rose-lookalike', 'Noah', 'psychic', 'who', 'out', 'Edward', 'secret', 'past', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'edited', 'out', 'completely', 'nobody', 'would', 'have', 'missed', 'as', 'would', 'have', 'much', 'Fritz', 'Lang', 'material', 'film', 'buff', 'did', 'appreciate', 'sly', 'wife', 'Thea', 'Von', 'Harbou', 'who', 'was', 'dedicated', 'follower', 'Hitler', 'movie', 'science', 'fiction', 'film', 'Lang', 'refering', 'historical', 'parts', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'pared', 'back', 'most', 'know', 'enough', '20th', 'century', 'history', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'pointed', 'references.As', 'Amestris', 'characters', 'seeing', 'Roy', 'Mustang', 'falling', 'completely', 'depression', 'self', 'loathing', 'key', 'subplot', 'series', 'only', 'rise', 'occasion', 'recover', 'belief', 'take', 'command', 'once', 'more', 'strongest', 'scenes', 'film', 'brief', 'reunion', 'Ed', 'Al', 'suddenly', 'movie', 'high', 'gear', 'terrific', 'Indiana', 'Jones-type', 'energy', 'sharp', 'dialog', 'comedy/action', 'timing', 'SHOULD', 'have', 'set', 'tone', 'film', 'When', 'Edward', 'Love', 'eyepatch', 'Pity', ""n't"", 'mouth', 'wanted', 'cheer', 'Classic', 'Taisa', 'Shrimp', 'sparring', 'characters', 'back', 'course', 'course', 'Armstrong', 'steals', 'scene', 'sparkles', 'all.Is', 'end', 'FMA', 'Good', 'question', 'have', 'been', 'few', 'short', 'OVA', 'there', 'nothing', 'scope', 'original', 'series', 'manga', 'still', 'running', 'strong.The', 'truth', 'was', 'so', 'much', 'potential', 'film', 'know', 'love', 'characters', 'share', 'history', 'want', 'know', 'what', 'next', 'Al', 'Ed', 'journey', 'fact', 'was', 'GUARANTEE', 'Gate', 'was', 'sealed', 'could', 'potentially', 'leave', 'door', 'open', 'more', 'films', 'who', 'Studio', 'Bones', 'FMA', 'anime', 'officially', 'completed', 'watch', 'documentary', 'disc', ""'ll"", 'see', 'original', 'script', 'was', 'originally', '100', 'pages', 'long', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'second', 'series', 'just', 'wish', 'final', 'hurrah', 'had', 'been', 'better', 'edited', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'tighter', 'more', 'exciting', 'film', 'Still', 'definitely', 'worth', 'seeing']",N/A

The Homunculus Gluttony is there, and with Gluttony and Wrath, Al is able to open a portal to Earth.  What ends up being the repercussions of this action, and can Al and the others save the day?Overall, I thought there was a very interesting story presented in Conqueror of Shamballa.  There was also decent animation, except for a few shots where the 3D animation really didn't meld well with the 2D animation.  One of the worst uses of the 3D is early on in the film, when Ed and Alfons are riding in the cart with the gypsies.  There are some shots of the surrounding landscape, and it was decided to use 3D animation for the trees.  To me, the 3D really called too much attention to itself in these shots, and I thought the 3D wasn't really necessary to use for something like trees.There are five features included on this release.  The first is ""The Making of Fullmetal Alchemist The Movie: Conqueror of Shamballa,"" which is a 40-minute documentary.  It has Japanese audio with English subtitles, and it includes interviews with the director, you get to see some the drawings and promo items for Fullmetal Alchemist, and there is footage and explanation for the various steps of the production of the film.  Overall, I thought this was a rather enjoyable documentary.Next is ""Original Trailers.""  It includes one US trailer for the film, seven Japanese TV trailers, and the Japanese theatrical trailer.  For the Japanese trailers, they also included English subtitles.  ""Production Art"" is a slideshow that runs for one minute and fourteen seconds, and it includes character designs and backdrops.  However, the viewer has no control over when the images in the slideshow change; this is frustrating, since each slide is only up for about a couple of seconds before it moves on to the next one.  ""Image Gallery"" is another slideshow, which runs for one minute and thirty-five seconds and includes still frames from the film.  The disc also includes trailers for the Funimation Channel, Dragon Ball Z, Moonphase, Trinity Blood, Case Closed, Spiral, Lupin the 3rd, and the Z-Store.This is a film I would recommend to anyone who enjoyed the original Fullmetal Alchemist anime series and wants to see how the story comes to an end.

If you (like me) are a beloved fan of the series, then this DVD purchase (or atleast a viewing) is a must!If I were to go into any of the plot, I may end up saying too much about the storyline and spoiling alot. So i'll try my very best to give a few details, and encourage you to purchase this DVD.The Conquerer of Shamballa, takes place in Germany. The place where Ed found himself trapped, after FMA ended. He is now a normal citizen there, unable to use Alchemy, and is trying to adapt to his new life. His world has citizens that resemble those that he'd known in his own world. Even a boy (by the name of Al) whom looks suprizingly like his younger brother. While on his way to a fair, he meets a fortune teller...or a gypsy of sorts. She sees into Ed's mind after touching him, eventually later telling him that she can see into his dreams. And she knows about his other world. The world he's really from.And that's where the fun begins....That's all i'm going to say about the plot. Saying any more, would give away too much, and thus, turn this review into a spoiler novelization.But rest assured, the action is there. The suspense is there. And even the heartfelt emotion from the television series, is there.If you're wanting to know what happened to Wrath and Gluttony, after FMA ended, this is the place to look. If you're wanting to know what happened to Ed and Al after FMA ended, this is the place to look. If you're simply wanting to know whom the Humunculus were originally modeled after, this DVD, is the place to look.All questions are answered here, in this nearly two-hour long conclusion to a great series. Yes. This movie isn't a stand-alone movie. It infact is, the conclusion to the series.Why let yourself miss out on the conclusion?Consider this movie to be the true final ""epsiode"", of Fullmetal Alchemist. Do yourself a favor as a fan of the series, and don't let yourself pass this deeply thrilling, awe-inspiring, and action-packed conclusion by.Purchase it.As a fan of Fullmetal Alchemist, you owe it to yourself to see the ""final episode"", and lay all pondered upon questions, to rest.5/5 stars.Brilliant finale, to a brilliant series!",5,What a conclusion...,1159660800,"10 1, 2006",2006,2722,"['What', 'conclusion', 'only', 'thing', 'could', 'say', 'completing', 'Fullmetal', 'Alchemist', 'Conquerer', 'Shamballa', '.If', 'anyone', 'was', 'wondering', 'what', 'Elric', 'brothers', 'anime', 'series', 'ended', ""'ll"", 'find', 'out', 'right', 'here.-Will', 'Elric', 'brothers', 'ever', 'see', 'eachother', 'again', '-Will', 'Ed', 'ever', 'return', 'own', 'world', '-Will', 'Al', 'ever', 'find', 'Ed', '-What', 'ever', 'happened', 'Ed', 'Al', 'father', 'what', 'earth', 'Shamballa', 'questions', 'more', 'are', 'answered', 'nearly', 'two-hour', 'long', 'conclusion', 'popular', 'anime', 'series', 'Fullmetal', 'Alchemist', 'are', 'beloved', 'fan', 'series', 'then', 'DVD', 'purchase', 'atleast', 'viewing', 'must', 'were', 'go', 'plot', 'may', 'end', 'up', 'saying', 'too', 'much', 'storyline', 'spoiling', 'alot', 'So', 'i', ""'ll"", 'try', 'very', 'best', 'give', 'few', 'details', 'encourage', 'purchase', 'DVD.The', 'Conquerer', 'Shamballa', 'place', 'Germany', 'place', 'where', 'Ed', 'found', 'trapped', 'FMA', 'ended', 'now', 'normal', 'citizen', 'there', 'unable', 'use', 'Alchemy', 'trying', 'adapt', 'new', 'life', 'world', 'citizens', 'resemble', ""'d"", 'known', 'own', 'world', 'Even', 'boy', 'name', 'Al', 'whom', 'suprizingly', 'younger', 'brother', 'way', 'fair', 'fortune', 'teller', 'gypsy', 'sorts', 'Ed', 'mind', 'touching', 'eventually', 'later', 'telling', 'can', 'see', 'dreams', 'other', 'world', 'world', 'really', 'from.And', 'where', 'fun', '.That', 'i', ""'m"", 'going', 'say', 'plot', 'Saying', 'more', 'would', 'give', 'away', 'too', 'much', 'thus', 'turn', 'review', 'spoiler', 'novelization.But', 'rest', 'assured', 'action', 'there', 'suspense', 'there', 'even', 'heartfelt', 'emotion', 'television', 'series', 'there.If', ""'re"", 'wanting', 'know', 'what', 'happened', 'Wrath', 'Gluttony', 'FMA', 'ended', 'place', 'look', ""'re"", 'wanting', 'know', 'what', 'happened', 'Ed', 'Al', 'FMA', 'ended', 'place', 'look', ""'re"", 'simply', 'wanting', 'know', 'whom', 'Humunculus', 'were', 'originally', 'modeled', 'DVD', 'place', 'look.All', 'questions', 'are', 'answered', 'here', 'nearly', 'two-hour', 'long', 'conclusion', 'great', 'series', 'Yes', 'movie', ""n't"", 'stand-alone', 'movie', 'infact', 'conclusion', 'series.Why', 'let', 'miss', 'out', 'conclusion', 'Consider', 'movie', 'be', 'true', 'final', 'epsiode', 'Fullmetal', 'Alchemist', 'Do', 'favor', 'fan', 'series', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'pass', 'deeply', 'thrilling', 'awe-inspiring', 'action-packed', 'conclusion', 'by.Purchase', 'fan', 'Fullmetal', 'Alchemist', 'owe', 'yourself', 'see', 'final', 'episode', 'lay', 'pondered', 'questions', 'rest.5/5', 'stars.Brilliant', 'finale', 'brilliant', 'series']",N/A
994458,A1ZWMBUQW366CP,B000FS2VWM,"Occasional Reviewer ""Musician""","[15, 25]","Let me start off by saying that I loved the Fullmetal Alchemist television series. I believe that it ranks among the top anime ever made. However, I don't feel that this movie holds a candle to it. After seeing the heart-wrenching conclusion of the television series (It would have left loose ends untied but could have stood on its own without this movie having been made) I heard that there was a movie. With much trepidation, I watched The Conqueror of Shamballa, hoping that my fears would not be confirmed but they were. This movie really feels like too many other full-length features based on television series; rushed, loosely tied together and crammed with way more style than substance. The deep characters that we grew to love in the series are gone and have been replaced with shallow, generic drones that spout cliche after cliche instead of the actually intelligent rhetoric of the series. For heaven's sake, there's even a gypsy woman character who serves no other purpose to the storyline other than to provide a pair of mammaries as fanservice. The only factors that keeps this from being a one-star film in my book is that there are fleeting moments of nostalgia in the film that help you remember just how brilliant and wonderful the television series is. Michiru Oshima's soundtrack is wonderful though it recycles a lot of music from the series. (It's good music though, so no need to complain) However, the great music doesn't hide what the film lacks otherwise. My recommendation in all caps: IF YOU HAVE SEEN THE FULLMETAL ALCHEMIST TELEVISION SERIES AND HAVEN'T SEEN THIS MOVIE YET, FORGET IT EXISTS AND ACCEPT THE SERIES' ENDING AS CANON. As a side note, I strongly urge Fullmetal fans who have not already done so to check out Hiromu Arakawa's original manga. The anime storyline diverges wildly from the original manga's at about the time that the homunculus, Greed, meets his demise. The manga's storyline is quite exciting and offers just as many twists and turns as the anime does, if not more. Plus, the manga is still ongoing, so if you're hungry for more Fullmetal Alchemist as the anime has ended, that's where to find it.(EDIT ADDED AFTER SECOND VIEWING: I was very hard on this film in this review and I still stand by most of what I've written but must concede that I have seen far worse movies than this one. However, one must remember that Fullmetal was a television series and was meant to be taken in in small doses. I imagine it's very difficult to transition from directing a television series to condensing a script to fit into a two-hour film.)",2,"Unfortunately, quite disappointing",1158364800,"09 16, 2006",2006,2590,"['Let', 'start', 'off', 'saying', 'loved', 'Fullmetal', 'Alchemist', 'television', 'series', 'believe', 'top', 'anime', 'ever', 'made', 'However', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'movie', 'candle', 'seeing', 'heart-wrenching', 'conclusion', 'television', 'series', 'would', 'have', 'left', 'loose', 'ends', 'untied', 'could', 'have', 'stood', 'own', 'movie', 'having', 'been', 'made', 'heard', 'was', 'movie', 'much', 'trepidation', 'watched', 'Conqueror', 'Shamballa', 'hoping', 'fears', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'confirmed', 'were', 'movie', 'really', 'feels', 'too', 'many', 'other', 'full-length', 'features', 'based', 'television', 'series', 'rushed', 'loosely', 'tied', 'together', 'crammed', 'way', 'more', 'style', 'substance', 'deep', 'characters', 'grew', 'love', 'series', 'are', 'gone', 'have', 'been', 'replaced', 'shallow', 'generic', 'drones', 'spout', 'cliche', 'cliche', 'instead', 'actually', 'intelligent', 'rhetoric', 'series', 'heaven', 'sake', 'even', 'gypsy', 'woman', 'character', 'who', 'other', 'purpose', 'storyline', 'other', 'provide', 'pair', 'mammaries', 'fanservice', 'only', 'factors', 'keeps', 'being', 'one-star', 'film', 'book', 'are', 'fleeting', 'moments', 'nostalgia', 'film', 'help', 'remember', 'just', 'how', 'brilliant', 'wonderful', 'television', 'series', 'Michiru', 'Oshima', 'soundtrack', 'wonderful', 'lot', 'music', 'series', 'good', 'music', 'need', 'complain', 'However', 'great', 'music', ""n't"", 'hide', 'what', 'film', 'otherwise', 'recommendation', 'caps', 'IF', 'YOU', 'HAVE', 'SEEN', 'THE', 'FULLMETAL', 'ALCHEMIST', 'TELEVISION', 'SERIES', 'AND', 'HAVE', ""N'T"", 'SEEN', 'THIS', 'MOVIE', 'YET', 'FORGET', 'IT', 'EXISTS', 'AND', 'ACCEPT', 'THE', 'SERIES', 'ENDING', 'CANON', 'side', 'note', 'strongly', 'urge', 'Fullmetal', 'fans', 'who', 'have', 'not', 'already', 'done', 'so', 'check', 'out', 'Hiromu', 'Arakawa', 'original', 'manga', 'anime', 'storyline', 'diverges', 'wildly', 'original', 'manga', 'time', 'homunculus', 'Greed', 'demise', 'manga', 'storyline', 'quite', 'exciting', 'just', 'as', 'many', 'twists', 'anime', 'not', 'more', 'manga', 'still', 'ongoing', 'so', ""'re"", 'hungry', 'more', 'Fullmetal', 'Alchemist', 'anime', 'ended', 'where', 'find', 'EDIT', 'ADDED', 'AFTER', 'SECOND', 'VIEWING', 'was', 'very', 'hard', 'film', 'review', 'still', 'stand', 'most', 'what', ""'ve"", 'written', 'must', 'concede', 'have', 'seen', 'far', 'worse', 'movies', 'one', 'However', 'must', 'remember', 'Fullmetal', 'was', 'television', 'series', 'was', 'meant', 'be', 'taken', 'small', 'doses', 'imagine', 'very', 'difficult', 'transition', 'directing', 'television', 'series', 'condensing', 'script', 'fit', 'two-hour', 'film']",N/A

994463,A24MLAQYHZ89DO,B000FS2VWM,"Scott ""Scott""","[5, 10]","Full Metal Alchemist the Movie picks up a few years after where the series left off. With the two brothers seperated by a rift in two worlds (with Ed being transported into one that looks much like our own. Things aren't going too well for him. However because it would be boring to see his character moping the whole time, stuff happens.The plot is crazy and doesn't make a whole lot of sense (which isn't helped by the fact that you need to have seen a 51 episode series to understand the events of this movie) but it's entertaining. There's something about the Nazis in here and how a woman who works for them is trying to open up a gate to Ed's world through Alchemy, but how Alchemy works in a world where it's not supposed to is never explained (for the same reason that Ed can clap his hands and make things appear while everyone else has to draw up elaborate chalk diagrams I suppose.)Anyway things start happening. People in metal suits invade Ed's world in giant flying ""Alchemy"" machines while the crazy woman screams about how she has magical powers now. In the end however everything works out okay. Oh, aside from the fact that Ed's dad is now dead and that the brothers are trapped in a world away from everyone they ever knew. And there's this gypsy girl who lives with them. Yeah, I dunno what that's about.FMA The Movie is well animated, and ends on what they try to convince you is a 'happy' note, but considering all the plot holes that this movie has it doesn't really deserve to be seen as the end of the series. Also the villains are given absolutly no motive. Why that is I don't know, but I can only think that perhaps the production studio was biting off more than they could chew here and opted to go with a visual over story approach. The whole production feels rather unfufilling though, and we're never given any reason to believe that this is actually a happy ending except for the fact that the two main characters, the Elric brothers, are smiling at the end.In a sentence, the FMA movie is only for great fans of the series who will overlook the subpar writing in the movie and enjoy the visuals. I still have no idea what the Nazi party was trying to invade this other world for. And who the heck was the crazy woman?

Of course, one you will not understand the story, two, you will regret it, because the art in the making of a sequel is seeing how well it follows its predecessor.So, if you decide to cheat, go ahead, it's your loss. You can't make a sequel without the first one being there, enough said.Now, if you are going to be smart and have already seen the series, hats off to you. Now, a quick review of the series before I go over the movie. When we last left Ed and Al, Ed had been stranded on the other side of the gate in an attempt to sacrifice his entire body and soul to get Al back (The back forth ""No, I want you to live,"" ""NO, you live"") went on and finally Al regains his body and Ed is stuck on the other side of the gate. In exchange for his body, Al lost his memories and Ed lost his arm and leg again. So, we begin the movie with Ed on the other side in the WWI-WWII period with the start of the rising of the Nazis.Now this is an interesting spin on the series. Most of the viewers of the series probably thought that the world of Fullmetal Alchemist had nothing to do with our world, that it was a completely alternate universe, wrong! The two sides are connected in the same way as the past and future, and the gate is some sort of gap between the two.And is this story, Ed is forced to abandon alchemy because it doesn't work on that side of the gate (Watch the movie and you'll figure out why). And in addition to that, he meets people that he recognizes from the other side of the gate, who look like those people but are almost polar opposites. Now, Al is on the other side and has been studying Alchemy this whole time in hopes of finding Ed, and a suprise twist of a character from the series springs up (Again, watch the movie to find out).On top of all this, we have the rising of the ambitious Nazis who want to get to the other side of the gate to ""Shambala"" to use the powers of that world to help the Nazis to rise.And as for the rest, just watch the movie (And watch the series first), to fully comprehend everything leading up to the movie, then watch the movie and enjoy a true masterpiece. ""Conqueror of Shambala"" pays tribute to every aspect of the Manga and the Anime, and is also a good movie for history buffs.Also, the special features has a selection of artwork from the making of the film, interviews with the actors and actresses and a full 45 minute special of a play by play clip on how they made the movie, from artwork, to scripts, to the exact pieces that they removed from the original screenplay (And the tour is led by the director).This is a must see, Brilliant!",5,An Unforgettable Heir to One of the Greatest Anime Series,1162598400,"11 4, 2006",2006,2749,"['First', 'all', 'many', 'people', 'have', 'said', 'movie', 'will', 'be', 'complete', 'utter', 'nonsense', 'decide', 'spoil', 'see', 'movie', 'first', 'course', 'one', 'will', 'not', 'understand', 'story', 'two', 'will', 'regret', 'art', 'making', 'sequel', 'seeing', 'how', 'well', 'predecessor.So', 'decide', 'cheat', 'go', 'ahead', 'loss', 'ca', ""n't"", 'make', 'sequel', 'first', 'one', 'being', 'there', 'enough', 'said.Now', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'smart', 'have', 'already', 'seen', 'series', 'Now', 'quick', 'review', 'series', 'go', 'movie', 'When', 'last', 'left', 'Ed', 'Al', 'Ed', 'had', 'been', 'stranded', 'other', 'side', 'gate', 'attempt', 'sacrifice', 'entire', 'body', 'soul', 'get', 'Al', 'back', 'back', 'forth', 'No', 'want', 'live', 'NO', 'live', 'went', 'finally', 'Al', 'body', 'Ed', 'stuck', 'other', 'side', 'gate', 'exchange', 'body', 'Al', 'lost', 'memories', 'Ed', 'lost', 'arm', 'leg', 'again', 'So', 'begin', 'movie', 'Ed', 'other', 'side', 'WWI-WWII', 'period', 'start', 'rising', 'Nazis.Now', 'interesting', 'spin', 'series', 'Most', 'viewers', 'series', 'probably', 'thought', 'world', 'Fullmetal', 'Alchemist', 'had', 'nothing', 'do', 'world', 'was', 'completely', 'alternate', 'universe', 'wrong', 'two', 'sides', 'are', 'connected', 'same', 'way', 'past', 'future', 'gate', 'sort', 'gap', 'two.And', 'story', 'Ed', 'forced', 'abandon', 'alchemy', ""n't"", 'work', 'side', 'gate', 'Watch', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'figure', 'out', 'why', 'addition', 'people', 'other', 'side', 'gate', 'who', 'look', 'people', 'are', 'almost', 'polar', 'opposites', 'Now', 'Al', 'other', 'side', 'been', 'studying', 'Alchemy', 'whole', 'time', 'hopes', 'finding', 'Ed', 'suprise', 'twist', 'character', 'series', 'up', 'Again', 'watch', 'movie', 'find', 'out', '.On', 'top', 'have', 'rising', 'ambitious', 'Nazis', 'who', 'want', 'get', 'other', 'side', 'gate', 'Shambala', 'use', 'powers', 'world', 'help', 'Nazis', 'rise.And', 'rest', 'just', 'watch', 'movie', 'watch', 'series', 'first', 'fully', 'comprehend', 'everything', 'leading', 'up', 'movie', 'then', 'watch', 'movie', 'enjoy', 'true', 'masterpiece', 'Conqueror', 'Shambala', 'tribute', 'aspect', 'Manga', 'Anime', 'also', 'good', 'movie', 'history', 'buffs.Also', 'special', 'features', 'selection', 'artwork', 'making', 'film', 'interviews', 'actors', 'actresses', 'full', '45', 'minute', 'special', 'play', 'play', 'clip', 'how', 'made', 'movie', 'artwork', 'scripts', 'exact', 'pieces', 'removed', 'original', 'screenplay', 'tour', 'led', 'director', '.This', 'must', 'see', 'Brilliant']",N/A
