I was looking for a workout that would really target my lower body (especially the glutes), and this one fits the bill. I'm not new to exercise or workout DVDs (I've used Insanity, Jillian Michaels, Bob Harper), but I still can't make it all the way through this one without stopping. It will definitely make your legs and butt feel like they're on fire.That being said, I really enjoy this workout because it's lower impact and it's a really nice change from traditional lower body workouts. I'm so glad I purchased this one and can't wait to see what results it brings!",5,Feel the Burn!,1344297600,"08 7, 2012",2012,647,"[""'ve"", 'used', 'DVD', 'three', 'times', 'have', 'loved', 'time', ""'ve"", 'used', 'was', 'looking', 'workout', 'would', 'really', 'target', 'lower', 'body', 'especially', 'glutes', 'one', 'bill', ""'m"", 'not', 'new', 'exercise', 'workout', 'DVDs', ""'ve"", 'used', 'Insanity', 'Jillian', 'Michaels', 'Bob', 'Harper', 'still', 'ca', ""n't"", 'make', 'way', 'one', 'stopping', 'will', 'definitely', 'make', 'legs', 'butt', 'feel', ""'re"", 'fire.That', 'being', 'said', 'really', 'enjoy', 'workout', 'lower', 'impact', 'really', 'nice', 'change', 'traditional', 'lower', 'body', 'workouts', ""'m"", 'so', 'glad', 'purchased', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'see', 'what', 'results']",N/A

This is a very challeging workout, Cathe is a genious maybe no her think but she is so smart, with the exercises choices that created the perfect barre workout. At least for me. I have many barre workouts, but what I like about this is that is very tough, she does not loose any time, you work very, very hard. Another thing that I like is that she work the upper body very hard too. In the others barre dvds, the upper body is part of the warm up and is very short and I always feel that I did not work the upper body. With this dvd you'll fell every muscle in your body work, did I say that is a hard workout? Love it. The good thing is that you have the pre-mixes, three shorts workouts to start with and them you can progres to the main one, wich is long, and of course HARD!",5,Excellent!!!!!!!,1344038400,"08 4, 2012",2012,798,"['name', 'Angela', 'very', 'challeging', 'workout', 'Cathe', 'genious', 'maybe', 'think', 'so', 'smart', 'exercises', 'choices', 'created', 'perfect', 'barre', 'workout', 'least', 'have', 'many', 'barre', 'workouts', 'what', 'like', 'very', 'tough', 'not', 'loose', 'time', 'work', 'very', 'very', 'hard', 'thing', 'like', 'work', 'upper', 'body', 'very', 'hard', 'too', 'others', 'barre', 'dvds', 'upper', 'body', 'part', 'warm', 'up', 'very', 'short', 'always', 'feel', 'did', 'not', 'work', 'upper', 'body', 'dvd', ""'ll"", 'fell', 'muscle', 'body', 'work', 'did', 'say', 'hard', 'workout', 'Love', 'good', 'thing', 'have', 'pre-mixes', 'three', 'shorts', 'start', 'can', 'progres', 'main', 'one', 'long', 'course', 'HARD']",N/A

1505302,A19XC6Z95GK5AB,B005XMGPJK,"Nancy Loderick ""Internet strategist""","[26, 27]","I knew I was going to love this workout when I felt my legs start to burn a few minutes into the warm up.  I'm a recent convert to barre style workouts,  having started with Tracy Effinger's Squeeze series.  My usual workout routines consist of heavy weights and intense cardio.Turbo Barre is part of Cathe's Low Impact Series.  You do high reps of all sorts.  This type of workout is what gives dancers their lean and toned look.What I adored about this workout:**It burns!  I love feeling my muscles work.  I feel so strong and accomplished.**The posture emphasis.  I spend my days hunched over a computer, so I welcome anything that helps me with better posture.  I find myself standing taller after doing this workout.**It's tough!  I couldn't keep up with Cathe and crew.  On several of the leg exercises, I was lucky to do about  half the reps.  This didn't discourage me, it gives me something to work towards.**It's fun and the time flies.  Dare I say that I was disappointed when the final stretch segment came?  I didn't want the workout to end.**Minimal equipment is needed.  All you need are:  light dumbbells, light resistance band and a chair.**The music and the workout routine are in sync.  I normally don't like Cathe's taste in music, but this time, the music fit the workout.  I find it so much easier and more motivating to work out to a driving beat.**The  pretty pink and black workout outfits.  Looking at these outfits provided a `distraction' from the pain of the workout.Some things to note about this workout:(I don't consider these negatives, but just things to note.)**While the workout is low impact, several of the moves can tweak your knees, especially the curtsy lunges.  I would suggest watching the workout before attempting it and making note of those exercises that you may need to modify.**Mostly your legs are worked in this routine.  You do maybe one exercise for each upper body part, e.g. biceps, triceps, chest and back.  I believe Cathe put these in for the calorie burn, not so much to really tone  these muscles.**It's tough and it's non-stop.  Don't get discouraged if you can't keep up with Cathe and crew.  Your muscles need to build up the endurance to do these types of exercises.I would have to say that this is my favorite workout in Cathe's Low Impact Series.  It's fun, it's different and it's effective.",5,Turbo charge your fitness!,1322179200,"11 25, 2011",2011,2359,"['knew', 'was', 'going', 'love', 'workout', 'when', 'felt', 'legs', 'start', 'burn', 'few', 'minutes', 'warm', 'up', ""'m"", 'recent', 'convert', 'barre', 'style', 'workouts', 'having', 'started', 'Tracy', 'Effinger', 'Squeeze', 'series', 'My', 'usual', 'workout', 'routines', 'consist', 'heavy', 'weights', 'intense', 'cardio.Turbo', 'Barre', 'part', 'Cathe', 'Low', 'Impact', 'Series', 'do', 'high', 'reps', 'sorts', 'type', 'workout', 'what', 'dancers', 'lean', 'toned', 'look.What', 'adored', 'workout', '**It', 'love', 'feeling', 'muscles', 'work', 'feel', 'so', 'strong', 'accomplished', '**The', 'posture', 'emphasis', 'spend', 'days', 'hunched', 'computer', 'welcome', 'anything', 'better', 'posture', 'find', 'standing', 'taller', 'doing', 'workout', '**It', 'tough', 'could', ""n't"", 'keep', 'up', 'Cathe', 'crew', 'several', 'leg', 'was', 'lucky', 'do', 'reps', 'did', ""n't"", 'discourage', 'something', 'work', 'towards', '**It', 'fun', 'time', 'flies', 'Dare', 'say', 'was', 'disappointed', 'when', 'final', 'stretch', 'segment', 'came', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'workout', 'end', '**Minimal', 'equipment', 'needed', 'need', 'are', 'light', 'dumbbells', 'light', 'resistance', 'band', 'chair', '**The', 'music', 'workout', 'routine', 'are', 'sync', 'normally', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'Cathe', 'taste', 'music', 'time', 'music', 'fit', 'workout', 'find', 'so', 'much', 'easier', 'more', 'motivating', 'work', 'out', 'driving', 'beat', 'pretty', 'pink', 'black', 'workout', 'outfits', 'Looking', 'outfits', 'provided', 'distraction', 'pain', 'workout.Some', 'things', 'note', 'workout', 'do', ""n't"", 'consider', 'negatives', 'just', 'things', 'note', 'workout', 'low', 'impact', 'several', 'moves', 'can', 'tweak', 'knees', 'especially', 'curtsy', 'would', 'suggest', 'watching', 'workout', 'attempting', 'making', 'note', 'exercises', 'may', 'need', 'modify', '**Mostly', 'legs', 'are', 'worked', 'routine', 'do', 'maybe', 'one', 'exercise', 'upper', 'body', 'part', 'e.g', 'biceps', 'triceps', 'chest', 'back', 'believe', 'Cathe', 'put', 'calorie', 'burn', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'really', 'tone', 'muscles', '**It', 'tough', 'non-stop', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'discouraged', 'ca', ""n't"", 'keep', 'up', 'Cathe', 'crew', 'muscles', 'need', 'build', 'up', 'endurance', 'do', 'types', 'exercises.I', 'would', 'have', 'say', 'favorite', 'workout', 'Cathe', 'Low', 'Impact', 'Series', 'fun', 'different', 'effective']",N/A
