288402,A2EEUQ81DTY7G3,6301978692,A Customer,"[5, 5]","Sweet Bird of Youth is initially a hard movie to get into, the first ten minutes are talky and oblique and it's sort of hard to figure out what the movie is going to be about. But once Geraldine Page's boozy, bitter, has-been movie star Alexandra Del Lago comes onto the screen and clashes with Paul Newman's naively ambitious gigolo Chance Wayne, viewers know they're in for a real treat.Controversial for it's time, Sweet Bird of Youth is all about the price one pays for fame and beauty, cleverly exposing the greed and hypocrisy of Hollywood and the South. The action centers on the small squalid Florida town of St. Cloud, currently mired in corruption and sleaze.Years ago the nasty misogynist Boss Finley - who runs the town with a fierce demagoguery - ran Chance out of town with a one-way ticket and the temptations of the American Dream. In fact, Chance - with his startling good looks - hoped to score it big in Hollywood as a matinee idol.When Finely finds out that Chance has returned accompanied by a whorey, drunken Hollywood actress, he's not happy at all. Chance was having an affair with Finley's beautiful daughter Heavenly (Shirley Knight) much to the chagrin of Finely and her evil brother Thomas (Rip Torn). Finley's spinsterish sister, aunt Nonnie (Mildred Dunnock), a victimized, frightened browbeaten woman, is the only person who still likes Chance, cherishing his love to Heavenly.Chance desperately wants to reconnect with Heavenly, but her father constantly surrounds her with the law and won't let her out of his sight. Chance is also unaware of the terrible secret - an illegal abortion - that shamed the family and almost bought the dynasty down. Flashbacks to their ""sweet bird"" time reveal that Chance once had the potential for a real relationship and a life better than a two-bit hustler.Now he spends much of his time with Alexandra, negotiating sex with her and desperately trying to get her to sign a contract and promote him Hollywood. He pops Benzedrine while she sinks back bottles of vodka, getting rolling drunk, and they think nothing of smoking pot when the mood takes them. There's a quiet anxiety to them both - she sees it as a relationship of convenience and he sees her as his one chance to make it big.The scenes between Chance and Alexandra are indeed the best parts of the movie, as a formidably beautiful bared-chested Newman struts around the hotel room, waxing lyrical to Alexandra how great he is, whilst she is so shattered at what she thinks is the bad reception of her latest film. After all, she's an aging starlet who has banked much of her career on her looks and she comes apart when she can't face those close-ups anymore.Transferring Tennessee Williams' material from the stage to the screen is always a risky endeavor. Sweet Bird of Youth incorporates a lot of flashbacks to keep the plot moving and to explain the various characters' pasts. But oftentimes the narrative comes across as clunky and awkward, the text is mannered and stagy and sometimes I wonder whether director Richard Brooks could have streamlined it a bit better from the stage to the screen.Still, the acting is mostly spectacular from the leads down to the supporting - you just never see performances like this on screen today. With Newman, Page and Begley getting the lions share of the hysterical scenes. Page is an absolute standout as Alexandra the aging, fading movie star; and Paul Newman is of course totally sexy as Chance, the selfish, self-involved stud.

288403,AGEIT17HENDIS,6301978692,Alfred Johnson,"[0, 0]","The first couple of paragraphs here have been used as introduction to other plays written by Tennessee Williams and reviewed in this space. This review applies to both the stage play and the film versions with differences noted as part of the reviewPerhaps, as is the case with this reviewer, if you have come to the works of the excellent American playwright Tennessee Williams through adaptations of his plays to commercially distributed film you too will have missed some of the more controversial and intriguing aspects of his plays that had placed him at that time along with Eugene O'Neill and Arthur Miller as America's finest serious playwrights.  Although some of the films have their own charms I want to address the written plays in this entry first (along with, when appropriate, commentary about Williams' extensive and detailed directing instructions).That said, there are certain limitations for a political commentator like this reviewer on the works of Williams. Although his plays, at least his best and most well-known ones, take place in the steamy South or its environs, there is virtually no acknowledgement of the race question that dominated Southern life during the period of the plays; and, for that matter was beginning to dominate national life. Thus, although it is possible to pay homage to his work on its artistic merits, I am very, very tentative about giving fulsome praise to that work on its political merits. With that proviso Williams nevertheless has created a very modern stage on which to address social questions at the personal level like homosexuality, incest and the dysfunctional family that only began to get addressed widely well after his ground-breaking work hit the stage.""Sweet Bird Of Youth"" is a case in point. Not for the first time, a seemingly 1950's style All- American boy Chance who has left his hometown, his home town girl and his roots behind to drift in that endless spiral toward fame- Hollywood and the movies, naturally- comes back to claim what is his by right. On this little hometown reunion Chance is in the service of one aging and fretful actress who has her own issues with that elusive `bird of youth'. In his return to town it appears that Chance has stirred up a hornet's nest with the local political establishment in the person of one red-neck preacher turned politician in order to better do ""god's work"", old Tom Findley. The object of this dispute is one Heavenly Findley, old Ton's daughter and Chance's left behind paramour who is now the subject of some scandal (due to the amorphously stated need for female-related medical treatment due to Chance's irresponsibility). Along the way we get to see how political power is distributed in a small Southern town as well as the inevitable tempting of the fates by Chance in order to win the `brass ring' before it is too late (apparently somewhere over thirty, by my reckoning). At play's end though, where he is between a rock and a hard place, Chance may not get the chance to be Chance at thirty. Oh, that fickle bird of youth. Still, Chance, go for it.In the movie version the recently departed excellent actor Paul Newman, a classic example of  a 1950's  All-American  boy type (among his other acting talents), as the movie star `wannabe' and Geraldine Page as the aging actress recreated their stage performances although with a greater screen presence for Ms. Page. Moreover, Chance's strivings to reconnect with Heavenly are more central to the plot. More importantly, the endings differ in that, despite some mauling by Tom Findley's boys Chance takes my advice from the play version and runs, with Heavenly, just as far and as fast as his now aging legs can carry him.",5,The Fickle Bird Of Youth,1231113600,"01 5, 2009",2009,3709,"['first', 'couple', 'paragraphs', 'here', 'have', 'been', 'used', 'introduction', 'other', 'plays', 'written', 'Tennessee', 'Williams', 'reviewed', 'space', 'review', 'both', 'stage', 'play', 'film', 'versions', 'differences', 'noted', 'part', 'reviewPerhaps', 'case', 'reviewer', 'have', 'come', 'works', 'excellent', 'American', 'playwright', 'Tennessee', 'Williams', 'adaptations', 'plays', 'commercially', 'distributed', 'film', 'too', 'will', 'have', 'missed', 'more', 'controversial', 'intriguing', 'aspects', 'plays', 'had', 'placed', 'time', 'Eugene', ""O'Neill"", 'Arthur', 'Miller', 'America', 'finest', 'serious', 'playwrights', 'films', 'have', 'own', 'charms', 'want', 'address', 'written', 'plays', 'entry', 'first', 'when', 'appropriate', 'commentary', 'Williams', 'extensive', 'detailed', 'directing', 'instructions', 'said', 'are', 'certain', 'limitations', 'political', 'commentator', 'reviewer', 'works', 'Williams', 'plays', 'least', 'best', 'most', 'well-known', 'ones', 'take', 'place', 'steamy', 'South', 'environs', 'virtually', 'acknowledgement', 'race', 'question', 'dominated', 'Southern', 'life', 'period', 'plays', 'matter', 'was', 'beginning', 'dominate', 'national', 'life', 'Thus', 'possible', 'pay', 'homage', 'work', 'artistic', 'merits', 'am', 'very', 'very', 'tentative', 'giving', 'fulsome', 'praise', 'work', 'political', 'merits', 'proviso', 'Williams', 'nevertheless', 'created', 'very', 'modern', 'stage', 'address', 'social', 'questions', 'personal', 'level', 'homosexuality', 'incest', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'only', 'began', 'get', 'addressed', 'widely', 'well', 'ground-breaking', 'work', 'hit', 'stage', 'Sweet', 'Bird', 'Youth', 'case', 'point', 'Not', 'first', 'time', 'seemingly', '1950', 'style', 'All-', 'American', 'boy', 'Chance', 'who', 'left', 'hometown', 'home', 'town', 'girl', 'roots', 'drift', 'endless', 'spiral', 'fame-', 'Hollywood', 'movies', 'naturally-', 'back', 'claim', 'what', 'right', 'little', 'hometown', 'reunion', 'Chance', 'service', 'one', 'aging', 'fretful', 'actress', 'who', 'own', 'issues', 'elusive', 'bird', 'youth', 'return', 'town', 'Chance', 'stirred', 'up', 'hornet', 'nest', 'local', 'political', 'establishment', 'person', 'one', 'red-neck', 'preacher', 'turned', 'politician', 'order', 'better', 'do', 'god', 'work', 'old', 'Tom', 'Findley', 'object', 'dispute', 'one', 'Heavenly', 'Findley', 'old', 'Ton', 'daughter', 'Chance', 'left', 'paramour', 'who', 'now', 'subject', 'scandal', 'due', 'amorphously', 'stated', 'need', 'female-related', 'medical', 'treatment', 'due', 'Chance', 'irresponsibility', 'way', 'get', 'see', 'how', 'political', 'power', 'distributed', 'small', 'Southern', 'town', 'as', 'well', 'inevitable', 'tempting', 'fates', 'Chance', 'order', 'win', 'brass', 'ring', 'too', 'late', 'apparently', 'somewhere', 'thirty', 'reckoning', 'play', 'end', 'though', 'where', 'rock', 'hard', 'place', 'Chance', 'may', 'not', 'get', 'chance', 'be', 'Chance', 'thirty', 'Oh', 'fickle', 'bird', 'youth', 'Still', 'Chance', 'go', 'it.In', 'movie', 'version', 'recently', 'departed', 'excellent', 'actor', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'classic', 'example', '1950', 'All-American', 'boy', 'type', 'other', 'acting', 'talents', 'movie', 'star', 'wannabe', 'Geraldine', 'Page', 'aging', 'actress', 'recreated', 'stage', 'performances', 'greater', 'screen', 'presence', 'Ms', 'Page', 'Moreover', 'Chance', 'strivings', 'reconnect', 'Heavenly', 'are', 'more', 'central', 'plot', 'More', 'importantly', 'endings', 'differ', 'mauling', 'Tom', 'Findley', 'boys', 'Chance', 'advice', 'play', 'version', 'runs', 'Heavenly', 'just', 'far', 'as', 'fast', 'now', 'aging', 'legs', 'can', 'carry']",N/A
288404,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6301978692,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 2]","It's become common knowledge to me that playwright Tennessee Williams has never been able to have his plays accurately transferred from stage to screen.  He is just too extreme for the time period in which he lived.  The very idea of castration, syphilis or racism (and that's just this play) was just too much for 60's cinema.  Regardless though, his films still managed to be effortless and poignant and dramatically outstanding.  `Sweet Bird of Youth' is just one of many (`Cat on a Hot Tin Roof' and `A Streetcar Named Desire' being his best film adaptations).  Whether or not it was able to tackle everything Williams' wanted it to, the fact remains that it is a stellar production that I am sure made him proud.The film follows Chance Wayne, a dreamer of sorts who is trying to make it big in Hollywood.  He left his hometown girlfriend Heavenly behind in order to pursue a career for himself and solidify their future, but in his absence her father, Boss Finley, has promised her hand to another.  When Chance returns home with washed up actress Alexandra Del Lago, Boss and his temperamental son Tom Jr. set out scheming a way to get Chance out of town, for good.As always, secrets from their past bubble forth to expose the foundation for their hatred of one another, thus creating some very tense and equally steamy moments.The performances are outstanding across the board, especially by the two leads.  I have made it very clear that I consider Paul Newman that greatest actor of all time, and I stand by that still.  He embodies Chance with his natural charm, but he adds these touching layers of vulnerability that make Chance a very understandable and sympathetic young man.  He uses those around him, but his acts are far from selfish.  Geraldine Page is phenomenal here, completely and utterly unforgettable.  I have mentioned before how I feel Newman is the perfect co-star, and he definitely works his magic at aiding Page in delivering an outstanding performance.  He just seems to naturally fit with whoever is sharing the screen with him.  Page feeds off that to infuse her character with an almost reluctant charm, which is refreshing and intoxicating.The supporting cast is all stellar, with Shirley Knight, Ed Begley, Madeleine Sherwood and Rip Torn all delivering top notch performances; especially Rip Torn, who is dastardly as the young and impetuous son of the Boss, searching and striving for approval.`Sweet Bird of Youth' is a cautionary tale about the blessings and maledictions that come with age.  Youth is a sweet bird, but bitter sweet really.  Looking at both the characters of Chance and Alexandra we see the opposing sides of that argument.  Chance is young and foolish and thus winds up suffering from his own immaturity, while Alexandra is older, more world-wise and yet she suffers from a society that rejects age as if it were an illness.Startling and absorbing, `Sweet Bird of Youth' is an outstanding example of enthralling cinema; a film that grabs you and never lets you go.  With fantastic performances, a strong script and a delicate hand behind the camera (Brooks works with Williams well, as he proved with 58's `Cat on a Hot Tin Roof' and cemented with this gem), this is a must-see film for any and everyone.",5,This film is very sweet indeed...,1238630400,"04 2, 2009",2009,3262,"['become', 'common', 'knowledge', 'playwright', 'Tennessee', 'Williams', 'never', 'been', 'able', 'have', 'plays', 'accurately', 'transferred', 'stage', 'screen', 'just', 'too', 'extreme', 'time', 'period', 'lived', 'very', 'idea', 'castration', 'syphilis', 'racism', 'just', 'play', 'was', 'just', 'too', 'much', '60', 'cinema', 'Regardless', 'films', 'still', 'managed', 'be', 'effortless', 'poignant', 'dramatically', 'outstanding', 'Sweet', 'Bird', 'Youth', 'just', 'one', 'many', 'Cat', 'Hot', 'Tin', 'Roof', 'Streetcar', 'Named', 'Desire', 'being', 'best', 'film', 'adaptations', 'not', 'was', 'able', 'tackle', 'everything', 'Williams', 'wanted', 'fact', 'stellar', 'production', 'am', 'sure', 'made', 'proud.The', 'film', 'Chance', 'Wayne', 'dreamer', 'sorts', 'who', 'trying', 'make', 'big', 'Hollywood', 'left', 'hometown', 'girlfriend', 'Heavenly', 'order', 'pursue', 'career', 'solidify', 'future', 'absence', 'father', 'Boss', 'Finley', 'promised', 'hand', 'When', 'Chance', 'home', 'washed', 'up', 'actress', 'Alexandra', 'Del', 'Lago', 'Boss', 'temperamental', 'son', 'Tom', 'Jr.', 'set', 'out', 'scheming', 'way', 'get', 'Chance', 'town', 'good.As', 'always', 'secrets', 'past', 'bubble', 'forth', 'expose', 'foundation', 'hatred', 'one', 'thus', 'creating', 'very', 'tense', 'equally', 'steamy', 'moments.The', 'performances', 'are', 'outstanding', 'board', 'especially', 'two', 'leads', 'have', 'made', 'very', 'clear', 'consider', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'greatest', 'actor', 'time', 'stand', 'still', 'Chance', 'natural', 'charm', 'touching', 'layers', 'vulnerability', 'make', 'Chance', 'very', 'understandable', 'sympathetic', 'young', 'man', 'acts', 'are', 'far', 'selfish', 'Geraldine', 'Page', 'phenomenal', 'here', 'completely', 'utterly', 'unforgettable', 'have', 'mentioned', 'how', 'feel', 'Newman', 'perfect', 'co-star', 'definitely', 'magic', 'aiding', 'Page', 'delivering', 'outstanding', 'performance', 'just', 'naturally', 'fit', 'whoever', 'sharing', 'screen', 'Page', 'feeds', 'off', 'infuse', 'character', 'almost', 'reluctant', 'charm', 'refreshing', 'intoxicating.The', 'supporting', 'cast', 'stellar', 'Shirley', 'Knight', 'Ed', 'Begley', 'Madeleine', 'Sherwood', 'Rip', 'Torn', 'delivering', 'top', 'notch', 'performances', 'especially', 'Rip', 'Torn', 'who', 'dastardly', 'young', 'impetuous', 'son', 'Boss', 'searching', 'striving', 'approval.', 'Sweet', 'Bird', 'Youth', 'cautionary', 'tale', 'blessings', 'maledictions', 'come', 'age', 'Youth', 'sweet', 'bird', 'bitter', 'sweet', 'really', 'Looking', 'characters', 'Chance', 'Alexandra', 'see', 'opposing', 'sides', 'argument', 'Chance', 'young', 'foolish', 'thus', 'up', 'suffering', 'own', 'immaturity', 'Alexandra', 'older', 'more', 'world-wise', 'yet', 'society', 'age', 'were', 'illness.Startling', 'absorbing', 'Sweet', 'Bird', 'Youth', 'outstanding', 'example', 'enthralling', 'cinema', 'film', 'grabs', 'never', 'lets', 'go', 'fantastic', 'performances', 'strong', 'script', 'delicate', 'hand', 'camera', 'Brooks', 'Williams', 'well', 'proved', '58', 'Cat', 'Hot', 'Tin', 'Roof', 'cemented', 'gem', 'must-see', 'film', 'everyone']",N/A

Foremost are the performances here most notably by Oscar winner Ed Begley and Geraldine Page.  Begley's role, though a supporting one, as a corrupt politico is one of those rare turns that envelope the whole movie much like Marlon Brando in ""The Godfather"" and Anthony Hopkins in ""The Silence of the Lambs"".  Calling everybody laddie through a cynical smile wielding a cane Begley's malevolence leaves an indelible stench that permeates your nervous system.

Berman, and writer-director Richard Brooks - were together again for this journey into Southern angst and self-deception.And a fifth force reappeared, too, to help shape the film version of the play: the Hollywood censors, notes the new book ""Tough as Nails: The Life and Films of Richard Brooks"" (available from amazon.com).A movie that climaxes with the ""hero"" being castrated? One with a female character who contracts venereal disease and undergoes a hysterectomy? Maybe on the Broadway stage, but not in a movie, not in 1962. Though limping a bit after the success of boundary-pushing movies like Brooks' ""Elmer Gantry"" and most anything directed by Otto Preminger, the Production Code could still force changes. The castration of Chance Wayne becomes a broken nose, and Heavenly Findlay appears to have undergone an abortion.Yet ""Sweet Bird of Youth"" remains a compelling drama thanks to its performances, particularly that of star Geraldine Page, supporting player Ed Begley, who won an Oscar as Boss Findlay, and young Shirley Knight. This movie captures a sense of the stage performances of Page and Newman and showcases a new talent in Knight.Where ""Cat"" seemed bound to one or two sets, Brooks opened up ""Sweet Bird"" and made good use of its Gulf setting.

Paul Newman stars as Chance Wayne, handsome, charming, lusty, and fame-hungry young gigolo who returns to his Southern home town after long stay in Florida and Hollywood where he tried to make a career as a movie star. He hoped to reconnect with two women he loved and left behind, his mother and his first love, Heavenly Finley. He hopes to make it this time because he brought with him a famous and once beautiful but now fading movie star with drinking problems, Princess Cosmonopolous aka Alexandra Del Lago (Geraldine Page). She needs a companion, he needs her connections. Once again, he will realize and bitterly admit that ""Failure is a contagious disease"". His mother died just before he returned and Heavenly's father, a local political boss (Ed Begley), hates him and swears revenge for having broken his daughter's heart. The film works thanks to the wonderful performances from Page, Begley, and breathtaking Paul Newman who looked like he was able to catch the sweet bird of youth and who gave an outstanding performance. Brooks changed the play's ending to give Chance and Heavenly hope for the better future but in the light of what we've seen, the movie's final feels like forced and unsatisfying.",3,"""Failure is a contagious disease"".,",1175904000,"04 7, 2007",2007,1382,"['Sweet', 'Bird', 'Youth', '1962', 'was', 'directed', 'Richard', 'Brooks', 'who', 'also', 'wrote', 'screenplay', 'based', 'one', 'darkest', 'most', 'pessimistic', 'plays', 'Tennessee', 'Williams', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'Chance', 'Wayne', 'handsome', 'charming', 'lusty', 'fame-hungry', 'young', 'gigolo', 'who', 'Southern', 'home', 'town', 'long', 'stay', 'Florida', 'Hollywood', 'where', 'tried', 'make', 'career', 'movie', 'star', 'hoped', 'reconnect', 'two', 'women', 'loved', 'left', 'behind', 'mother', 'first', 'love', 'Heavenly', 'Finley', 'make', 'time', 'brought', 'famous', 'once', 'beautiful', 'now', 'fading', 'movie', 'star', 'drinking', 'problems', 'Princess', 'Cosmonopolous', 'aka', 'Alexandra', 'Del', 'Lago', 'Geraldine', 'Page', 'companion', 'connections', 'Once', 'again', 'will', 'realize', 'bitterly', 'admit', 'Failure', 'contagious', 'disease', 'mother', 'died', 'just', 'returned', 'Heavenly', 'father', 'local', 'political', 'boss', 'Ed', 'Begley', 'swears', 'revenge', 'having', 'broken', 'daughter', 'heart', 'film', 'thanks', 'wonderful', 'performances', 'Page', 'Begley', 'breathtaking', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'who', 'looked', 'was', 'able', 'catch', 'sweet', 'bird', 'youth', 'who', 'gave', 'outstanding', 'performance', 'Brooks', 'changed', 'play', 'ending', 'give', 'Chance', 'Heavenly', 'hope', 'better', 'future', 'light', 'what', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'movie', 'final', 'feels', 'forced', 'unsatisfying']",N/A

Starring Geraldine Page as Alexandra Del Lago and Paul Newman as Chance Wayne in the role they created on Broadway, the film is chock full of what we expect from Mr. Williams: fragile beautiful women, handsome flawed men and a story fraught with more Southern gothicism than a lesser writer could have handled. Alexandra is a fading actress in the company of Wayne, her gigolo/driver, as they return to the Southern town that Wayne has left where his old girlfriend Heavenly's-- do you believe that name?-- father is the mayor. Even though the censors sacked the veneral disease and castration in the original Williams play and added a Hollywood happy ending, there are still enough kinks remaining to go around.While all the actors give decent performances-- Ed Begley won a supporting actor Oscar for his portrayal as the mayor-- Geraldine Page is simply magnificent as the over-the-hill substance abusing actress. Newman plays well the role he has done over and over, the handsome brooding stud who cannot keep his shirt on.If we ever doubted that the sweet bird of youth flies away quickly, we need look no further than the interviews with some of the actors included with the DVD. Shirley Knight who plays the peaches-and-cream beauty Heavenly had aged so much that I didn't recognize her at first.Williams' cast of characters are as memorable and American as Willie Loman and the characters in ""Our Town.""

I'm among the greatest of Geraldine Page's fans, and the only better news I could get would be that ""Summer & Smoke"" will be out soon. Indeed, Williams' play was toned down for the studio sensibilities of the 60's. Newman was very fine, as was Shirley Knight, Madeline Sherwood, Ed Begley & Rip Torn. But it's Page who carries this amazing film about depravity, disappointment and hopelessness. Page did the role many times on stage, and Paul Newman was an excellent choice for Chance Wayne.

The Film does convey the actual personality of this possibly greatest of all American writers.  This film is a potential insight into the inner psyche of Mr. Williams, often referred to as a ""Poet of the Emotions"".The character of Alexandra De Lago could have potentially mirrored the personality of Mr. Williams, in that he had experienced a brilliant career, and was getting older, and suffering more health problems.  The character of Chance Wayne, played by Paul Newman again potentially illlustrated the personality of an individual Mr. Williams was most emotionally attracted to in life.  Geraldine Page gives a very good performance in the Lead Role, but the film could have been possibly much more interesting (not necessarily better) if indeed Talllulah Bankhead could have played this part, especially as it was written for Miss Bankhead by Mr. Williams, and a role he especially wanted her to play.Tallulah Bankhead was offered this part, but turned it down because she felt it was the story of another degraded Southern woman.

She promises to get him a movie contract, and they drive to his Southern hometown, where he plans to find his sweetheart, Heavenly Finley (Shirley Knight), and take her along to Hollywood... He doesn't know that on his last visit he left her pregnant, that she had an abortion, and that her father, the corrupt and vigorous politician Boss Finley (Ed Begley), is out to get him...Through a strong, powerful performance, Newman managed to be a celebrity--dropping names, giving large tips, arrogantly stating: ""Just because a man's successful doesn't mean he has to forget his hometown.""He's also extremely sneaky and gently tolerant, as he charms Alexandra while recording what she's saying for blackmail purposes... But he's finally pathetic: a desperately insecure man, addicted to amphetamines, attending to Alexandra and performing as a lover at her whim... His mask of swaggering bravura really disappears when he tries to see Heavenly...

Both Alexandra and Chance are the very epitome of selfishness.  Only thinking of their futures and dreams without thinking of consequences to the other human beings in their lives.Chance has left his hometown and the love of his life, Heavenly Finley, played by Shirley Knight, to seek fame and fortune in New York and Hollywood. Not so lucky is Chance, however, as he picks Alexandra up in Palm Beach while playing BEACH BOY and sex slave to the stars.Once returning home, however, Heavenly's father and brother, played aptly by Ed Begley (Oscar Winner 1962) as Tom 'Boss' Finley, and  Rip Torn (who was married to Geraldine page at the time) as Thomas 'Tom' J. Finley, Jr. are trying like hell to get rid of Chance and his aging drunk of a has-been hollywood screen star.Mildred Dunnock (Whatever Happened To Aunt Alice & The Corn Is Green)is the kind, Aunt Nonnie who secretly arranges for Chance and Heavenly to meet on the sly while Chance is in town.Madeleine Sherwood (Mae from Cat On A Hot tin Roof) is Boss Finley's mistress, Miss Lucy and has a great bit part and a pivotal role in the film.Alexandra comes to realize that she actually has feelings for someone other than herself in Chance and tells him.  But of course, Chance runs off to his Heavenly. Many a fight ensues with  a sort of happy ending, given that this is Williams!Tennessee Williams plays have ALWAYS and A DAY, been toned down given the year in which the films were adapted but you still get the jist of the dirty deeds that go on and in Sweet Bird Of Youth. The following are exhibited:  Infidelity, Pornography, Aging, Pride, Greed, Lust, Revenge, Prostitution, Abortion, Assult, Domestic Violence, Drunkeness, Drug Use, Incest, Impotence, Syphillis and Racism.  All classic touchstones of Tennessee's plays minus the homosexuality. ( View ""Cat On A Hot Tin Roof"" or ""Suddenly Last Summer"" for examples)Great performances by the whole cast!
