778150,A89TORK8VPO9X,B0000DC150,"Culture Vulture ""realwildchild""","[2, 4]",This movie missed the boat at every turn.  Frisk was a rough alienating novel where the main characters used S&M; sex as a balm for their feelings of alienation.  The woefully miscast actors were not up to the task of the complex emotions that should have guided this piece.  Parker Posey always wonderful was reduced to playing a stand-in for some of the more nefarious characters in the novel the sadistic germans who assisted the lead in their dangerous sex games that ended in murder.There's little skin on display for the voyeur crowd - was anyone really dying to see Alexis naked?All-in-all infuriating and dissatifying.,1,watered down version of an intense novel,1240185600,"04 20, 2009",2009,626,"['movie', 'missed', 'boat', 'turn', 'Frisk', 'was', 'rough', 'alienating', 'novel', 'where', 'main', 'characters', 'used', 'S', 'M', 'sex', 'balm', 'feelings', 'alienation', 'woefully', 'miscast', 'actors', 'were', 'not', 'up', 'task', 'complex', 'emotions', 'should', 'have', 'guided', 'piece', 'Parker', 'Posey', 'always', 'wonderful', 'was', 'reduced', 'playing', 'stand-in', 'more', 'nefarious', 'characters', 'novel', 'sadistic', 'germans', 'who', 'assisted', 'lead', 'dangerous', 'sex', 'games', 'ended', 'little', 'skin', 'display', 'voyeur', 'crowd', 'was', 'anyone', 'really', 'dying', 'see', 'Alexis', 'naked', 'All-in-all', 'infuriating', 'dissatifying']",N/A

This film does not make it on any level: dramatic or erotic. It is boring and repetitious unless you like white BVDs. The models are mostly mediocre with mostly mediocre bodies. I'm not sure that it has a real plot. The photography is dull, dim, dark, and fuzzy. The acting and dialogue are bad. The scenery/backgrounds are all cheapo. Just when I thought this movie could not get any worse, the broads showed up! How can anyone be bothered to make such a piece of junk? Of course the reviewers have to lie, there is nothing good to be said about this thing. Only a movie masochist could like it.

It's good looking gay men acting out some very sadistic fantasies. Things I have fantasized doing to a couple of my ex's. Notwithstanding, I,of course would never do such, but it's there lurking in the back of my mind. Don't laugh at me, and don't touch my makeup! There is a theory that societies that supress artistic  expressions of sexuality and brutality wind up acting them out for real, ie...the Nazis. Those where freedom of speech allows for such expression are far more healthy. We must be in good shape then. Really this film is a shocker, but that's good. It's just a movie afterall. Mind you, the operative word here is FANTASY! As long as you know the difference between real and imaginary, you are okay.",5,Slasher film for the community.
