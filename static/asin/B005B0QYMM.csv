The acting was decent, but its the over-the-top sound and in-your-face images intended to scare does absolutely nothing but annoy.Every scene was predictable, so I don't suppose this is a spoiler alert to say the wheelchair, table, and bathtub scenes did nothing. Or the giant distorting screaming faces that have been done to death.The only creepy scene was the arms coming out of the wall, when they GREW in size.

It was interesting, so I bought this film used at my local Hastings. The beginning is very cheesy because they over do it with the parody of ghost reality shows. And even bribing ppl to lie about the supernatural? LOL! It's a major cheese fest...until the doors are locked. Then, the movie takes a 180 degree turn and becomes truly scary. I thought the CGI was pretty good, especially the ""tongueless"" monster. That thing creeped me out! The thing in the bathtub was also very scary. I give this fright flick 4 instead of 5 stars because I could not stand the dialogue. Every other word was the F word. F this and F that. It got annoying and killed some of the tension. The acting was very good though, and the atmosphere was oh so terrifying. If you like low budget ""mockumentary"" horror, then give this a watch. It's worth it, and lives up to the hype given by the infamous trailer. There is one scene that seems to be inspired by Roman Polanski's ""Repulsion"" that is both scary and hilarious at the same time, that is worthy of mention.The special features are okay...an interview with the directors and producer, along with a short making of featurette.

When the daylight fades, the lighting turns into green infra-red and becomes very reminescent of a long-standing ghost-buster series. You know the one where the busters' eyes turn white from the infra-red? There are latent and ominous spoof prescedents,which is off-putting. But actually, it is all a parody of the media-world - the better to contrast to a quite opposite occult-ghost realm. I would not have made it past this beginning except when i skimmed the reviews here, many said this film would get dark soon enough and it did.Definitely spooky in a realistic way for most of the film until towards the end when the 2nd ghost went into high spoof. But the film recovers .My ""favourite"" is when the camera silently films down a long corridor where one of the crew is raised from the ground and moves in an unnerving puppet-like way.The film does become more spoofed as if geared towards young adult teens) but it doesn't matter because the dis-orientation with space and time is so convincing, ; from the first time that they bust the front door down to discover yet another corridor.. Meanwhile the crew continue to function as media-types out of their depth.,which is sort of humourous, at times The corridors never end. This is the most scary aspect.

This is a really scary movie, and I couldn't sleep properly for about a week after I first saw it. This movie is not for everyone.The film is about a guy named Lance Preston and a group of people who are doing a reality show called ''Grave Encounters''. It is a ghost hunting reality show. The movie is one of their episodes where they go to a haunted mental institution. When they get there, they decide to film all the time. They soon realize that the place is actually haunted, and they can't stay in character anymore. They become literally terrified. They soon realize that the institution is not only haunted, it's alive. They run through the exit, and it is a whole new hallway. They look outside in the daytime, and it is still dark outside. They open their food bin, and all the food is rotten as if it's been there for months.Some of the scary things that happen are the following:1. A spirit moves Sasha's hair2. Sasha wakes up, and the word ''Hello' is scratched on her back.3. They see a woman in a room who then looks at them and her face contorts evilly4. They find their friend Matt, who is now crazy. And he tells them ''they can all leave as soon as they're better''.5. The group wakes up, and they are wearing patient bracelets with their names on them.6. A girl who killed herself comes out of a bathtub filled with blood and grabs one of the crew members, then they both disappear7. Many black arms come out of the walls and ceiling and start grabbing at them8. Lance walks down a hallway, and an evil spirit runs at him and starts hitting the camera9. Lance records himself and plays it back, and he hears spirits on his tape10. Lance is trapped in a long underground hallway, and he hears spirits screaming and laughing.11. The scene where Lance finds pictures of his friends being lobotomized.12.

1452479,A1Y0HX12MCT6OR,B005B0QYMM,I'm Right,"[1, 4]","SpoilersI saw the trailer for this somewhere on the internet, it was getting passed around and it looked pretty good, a rather low budget film passing along through word of mouth, who knows? Could be the next blair witch/paranormal activity, and the story was pretty interesting as well, ghost hunters being stuck in a mental asylum? The possibilities are endless!But then you meet the characters...The 'main' character you're apparently supposed to relate with is a total a**hole, he has his token love interest that says nothing worthwhile, the token black guy who has lines like ""man i could be smokin' some trees right now"", the old guy that looked like Mick Jagger, and the idiot cameraman who looks like Shaggy from scooby doo. Wow, I mean I get that they're making some comment on all those ghost-hunting shows but you could at least put a little more character into these crude stereotypes to make the audience care about what's happening.And this was my biggest problem with Grave Encounters, dumbed down lame two dimensional parodies of what Grave Encounters is trying to lampoon while imitating. Confused yet? Don't worry this movie doesn't require much thought. The handheld camera genre works best if you like the characters you're following around, because you're essentially stuck with them, and here I'd rather be hanging out with the ghosts/demons/whatever than these tools.The story itself was intriuging but ultimately a letdown, the set up was nice, they paced it out ok and some of the background stories (fake or not) helped set up the sense of dread which clashed nicely with the crew's naivety. Once the scares kick in though there's very little that's original and hasn't been seen before from Grave Encounters. Although I did like the film's answer to the ancient question ""why don't they just leave the building"", as it gets interesting when the mental hospital becomes a twisted maze.One of the things that worked in what I consider the best handheld camera movie [REC] was they were zombies/demons and they had a physical threat that you could understand. Here what exactly is the threat with the ghosts, they lift some stuff up sure, but that's about it. Maybe someone could've gotten possessed or something to make a real threat instead of windows opening. Oh and speaking of [REC] this movie shamelessly ripped off the ending where the last person confronts the 'original monster' or whatever and gets offed, AND they ripped off the death scene in [REC]2 where someone gets pulled into water and disappears; it was cool in [REC]2 when it was original, but it was just pathetic in this film. The 'Vicious Brothers' couldn't think of anything else?Also when it ends, it just ends and doesn't wrap itself up full circle with the opening of the movie where you see a producer or something introducing the audience to the 'lost footage', it might as well have been the directors saying 'we hope you'll enjoy Grave Encounters!' since it served no purpose than to open the film. If you're a fan of ghost movies or handheld camera movies, chances are you've seen everything in Grave Encounters before and done better, except the arms scene, that was pretty cool. Oh wait did I say pretty cool?

You have a group of people here that are out to create a new genre of reality TV (the producer in the first shot claimed it was before the whole batch of ghost hunting shows already out there now). It's hinted that, after filming 5 episodes at other locations, they may have a break for their 6th at an actively haunted asylum. For the first... maybe 10-15 minutes, it reminded me of The Last Exorcism, using frank humor and capturing their fraudulent sides as a way of breaking the ice to the viewer (""Hey, how about if I pay you a little to lie and say you saw something?""). During the one night stay in the asylum, all common sense and rationalizing comes to a halt. Even the logic in the scriptwriting. What caught my interest halfway through that kept me from turning it off was that the asylum itself was messing with the crew. Not strictly limited to BOO moments and shadow figures, there was an element of confusion of time. A night eternal, one could say. With that in mind, it had me wondering how the producers could have found the ""film"" to show it, and it's never revealed, nor hinted at. While the ghosts and specters and sounds keep messing with everyone, the building itself pulls complex pranks on everyone in creative ways (though there's a Greek myth of a certain labyrinth they may have taken some tips from).Not the most original, especially with how, after 5 hours into their stay, the crew's sense of logic deteriorates rather quickly, then close to immediately, completely goes away, leaving you with a bunch of college kids who try to sound tough, leave out the brave, cuss each other out on the most sound decisions then go and do the most reckless things without a second thought.

Flicks like this and The Hazing (2004) inspire me to continue taking chances when Netflix or Amazon throws a weird suggestion my way.  I give this a direct-to-DVD horror ""A"".This movie operates much like The Last Exorcism (2010).  We follow Lance Preston and his Ghost Hunters film crew into a haunted mental hospital in search of the paranormal.  It comes off as a satire, with a lot of sophomoric sarcasm and a totally fake medium.  They laugh about things being ""too over the top"" between cuts and they pay a gardener twenty bucks to lie about seeing a ghost on the property.  This works out fantastically!  Normally the first 20-30 minutes of any horror are painful.  They have barely-trained actors and a perfunctory storyline.  Grave Encounters, however, has good acting and draws a lot of smiles as we learn about the film crew.  This also serves as a superior directorial device to engage the viewers into caring about these characters.The story is simple and certainly nothing new.  The crew locks themselves into the abandoned hospital from 10pm-6am, giving them eight hours in total darkness to catch some paranormal activity on film.  They get a tour from the caretaker and hear a few ""real"" ghost stories about the place to hype up their show (called Grave Encounters) and choose where to place static cameras.The execution is more like the Paranormal Activity films (2007, 2010, 2011).  There's a lot of slow tension build-up and you find yourself concentrating on the screen; staring waiting for something to move and listening for a subtle sound (like White Noise (2005)).  This is a style that I love, but many people don't like this.What caught me off guard is that while everything was done surprisingly well in terms of acting, effects, sets, scares, and directing, the writing seemed very misguided.  Not the dialogue, but the events.  At first things seem sensible.  Some random objects move here and there.  But as the movie progresses and the intensity of the paranormal activity amplifies, the events seem less connected.  The writers mix elements of ""ghost"" movies with elements of ""house"" movies.  In the movie, Lance explains that there are static and intelligent hauntings.  Static haunting account for the ""house"" movie subgenre, in which there is an energy echoing a past event (but there is no specific ghost, demon or spirit).  Intelligent hauntings are our ""ghost"" story subgenre, in which a paranormal entity has some motivation and responds to human presence.  In most horror movies, the writing will choose one subgenre or the other.  Really never both.Anyway, this subgenre combo doesn't work.  People start disappearing or dying and we don't know why.  Some weird things happen that make me want to guess ""why this is happening"" or ""what the ghost wants"" or ""what happened in the hospital"" or ""are the crew members somehow linked to the hospital?""  Ultimately, I was hit with a lot of red herrings which served no end.  As a result, the end of the movie was simply when we ran out of people to kill or mysteriously disappear.  I wanted a little more.Despite this big overall writing flaw, each individual scene worked well.  I enjoyed every five minute piece of the movie.  But after the first 30 minutes, the scenes just failed to make a story when assembled chronologically.However critical I may sound, I really enjoyed this and strongly recommend it to any of you who enjoy occasionally taking a chance on an unknown direct-to-DVD horror.",5,They were searching for proof...they found it!

Napier ""Constant Evolution""","[2, 2]","I should say that I do like Ghost Adventures (the show that this is a parody of).With that being said the intro was hilarious to me. It perfectly mimics the show and delivers some great ""off camera"" gags too.It sets up as a standard ghost investigation show and mid way through it all be comes a little more real then they expected.Not really deep and basically the whole plot right there.Few criticisms (mind you the movie stands on its own for what it is, so below is all personal opinion):They did an awesome job at setting up a creepy WTF type atmosphere. I do wish they would have left more to the imagination. They basically show all the deaths of the people that die, which kinda takes away the mystery of the insane asylum. It would have been great to see someone get dragged into one of the rooms, the door slams shut and all you hear are screams and maybe blood dripping from out the bottom of the door. Hitchcock style where you use your imagination to scare you to death.(Ironic: this is from a guy who doesn't even really like horror flicks).This would have worked well in this movie because the asylum seemed so closed in. If applied, every room would have then appeared to be a death trap.Enough with the angry black guy!! Damn seriously it's 2014 and we still need an angry black guy in every movie? We get it, he is there to add tension and whats more scary then a haunted asylum? Ah yeah an angry black guy of course. He already had a good story, a family man and a strong need to survive to get back to his little girl. He didn't need to be so abrasive, in fact, it was in direct contrast to how he was acting earlier in the movie. Playing football and laughing / sweet talking his baby girl. Yet he was the only one to lose his cool out of the bunch. *cough* cliche *cough*More background!!!I usually never say this about horror flicks because really who cares? But this setup was too sweet to leave alone. They gave a great setup to a mental health doctor who worked there but I seriously wanted to know more about the Asylum. Like had anyone else disappeared there previously. What's with the time anomaly? How where the tapes eventually found? (Maybe they said this one at the beginning but i missed it) and for pete's sake how did the rats survive there if all the food spoils?All in all it's not the best picture ever but I think that I went in not expecting much and that's why it blew me away.

I normally only only write reviews about concert DVDs these days, but this flick was such a shock to my system I felt compelled to convey my impressions on it.I'm not one to give away the plot so I'll stick to the basics here : a group of amateur fellas shooting a pilot for a paranormal investigation series lock themselves up in an abandoned mental institution for one night. They do not even believe in the paranormal and are in it for the cash. But many a spooky surprise await them as the night develops.This is another camcorder movie in the vein of The Blairwitch Project -which started the trend to begin with- only SO much better. It caused me to literally JUMP in my couch and gave me a sweaty nightmare that night, and I'm a 52-year-old fella and a seasoned horror movie buff who thought nothing could shock me anymore; man was I wrong !They didn't even resort to music to create the atmos and that's a tough acomplishment.The film is fantastically edited with great 1.78:1 pic (so it filled my screen,unlike so many horribly letterboxed movies that are OK at the movies but make you feel cheated if your TV is less than 50) with great sound to match.

1452492,A10872FHIJAKKD,B005B0QYMM,Just Bill,"[3, 5]","Periodically, I get a hankering for scary movies. Tonight, at the local rental store, I found Grave Encounters.When I rent movies, I take my iPhone and scan the bar code. It takes me to Amazon where I check two things: (a) the rating, and (b) the customer comments. I don't usually rent movies below 3.5 stars. Four is my gold standard. Three stars is a risk that, admittedly, occasionally pays off. But my sweet spot is four stars.Grave Encounters was a solidly rated movie so I thought I'd take a chance.The opening was beyond cheesy. The jittery, jerky hand-held camera work was making me ill. I kept thinking, ""These are supposed to be documentary film makers who shoot reality TV shows and they can't even hold a camera steady for three seconds?""For the record, I abhor jittery, quick-cut movies. I've walked out of them at the theater, and I've avoided seeing them once I read reviews about them. Such camera work is the sign of a director painfully low on talent, and even more bereft of ideas. Often, that kind of camera work is a failed attempt to hide a bad story, or bad acting, or both.So I was worried when Grave Encounters began and all I saw was an attempt to look edgy and ""real.""Eventually, once the actors got inside the mental institution, it got better. The camera work wasn't as nauseating and the movie finally kicked into gear.The old mental institution was truly creepy. It, alone, was worth seeing. But what could have been a very, very unsettling movie deteriorated into parody by people who kept splitting up into excursions, alone, into dark places. Like when they sent the equipment guy to gather up all the static cameras. Really? They're trying to get out of a scary situation and they send the guy to take down and bring back all the cameras placed throughout the hospital? Seriously?Needless to say, that guy disappeared.The acting - especially by the Goth chick - was pretty bad. I never once bought that she was anything more than an actor trying to look scared. She was nice to look at. But she added nothing to the movie.Then the ""monsters"" came out. And they were pretty hokey. There wasn't really an explanation as to why the ghosts of dead mental patients would become monsters with unhinged mouths and a desire to kill. But there they were.This movie could have been a home run. It was an interesting premise. But the execution was flawed.I recommend Grave Encounters, but with reservations. I thought it was okay.

The first 2/3rds of the movie was entertaining  and seemed to be building very well into something worthy of the views time... then it falls apart into a total and utter amateur disappointment. Like the failed Lonely Island pilot for Fox ""Awesometown"" amateur disappointment or a really bad student project for an After Effects class disappointment.The film starts off with 5 people shooting a Ghost Hunting TV show, who lock themselves in a haunted, abandon mental institution which looks way to clean to have been abandon for more then a few days, which can be over looked. Trouble starts as the crew is beginning to wrap shooting up for the evening. Typical ghost hunting show type stuff starts happening and suspense starts to build at a decent pace and we start to see the interesting scenes from the trailer. Shortly after the scene from the trailer where the girl turns around and morphs into a creature is where the wheels completely fall off the bus. At the point where hands start coming out of the walls and ceiling is when it's time to shut it off because it marks the point where this film turns into little more then an amateur remake of the Blair Witch Project complete with the camera dropping to the floor, off screen ending with screaming to imply what is happening to the final victim.I truly had high hopes for this film after seeing the trailer and the leaps that digital video has had over the past few years. The real problem is the non-climax and ""been done before"" ending. Truly an utterly disappointing, I can see why it's only available on Pay-Per-View and didn't have a true theatrical release.

Using a simple and pure setup of a team of paranormal investigators staying overnight in a haunted asylum, this movie may start like most others in a slow, world-building setup with its familiar characters, but it finishes stronger than almost all others.One unfortunate trope for low-budget horror is that only in the last, final shot does any money get blown on an actual fleeting special effect. Not so with this one. Time after time, jump after jump, the filmmakers jam the supernatural right into the camera to terrific effect.Another thing that elevates &#34;Grave Encounters&#34; is the desperate and deranged intensity that consumes the characters. Again, many movies will have their characters sweat and bemoan their unfortunate circumstances. But this one really delivers on a palpable and depressing dread, as characters beg for forgiveness, mercy and salvation in a truly gut-wrenching manor as their chances of survival erode.Once the movie gets going, it does not stop. Offering a plethora of frights from subtle creepiness to overt insanity jumping at your face, it is the hallmark of all great horror films where even the banal scenes are filled with an uncomfortable tension that something might happen at any moment.This is vintage horror best watched in the dark.",5,Scares and intensity to spare,1404691200,"07 7, 2014",2014,1416,"['Found-footage', 'horror', 'films', 'are', 'dime', 'dozen', 'days', 'film', 'definitely', 'highest', 'echelon', 'terms', 'fright', 'Using', 'simple', 'pure', 'setup', 'team', 'paranormal', 'investigators', 'staying', 'overnight', 'haunted', 'asylum', 'movie', 'may', 'start', 'most', 'others', 'slow', 'world-building', 'setup', 'familiar', 'characters', 'stronger', 'almost', 'others.One', 'unfortunate', 'trope', 'low-budget', 'horror', 'only', 'last', 'final', 'shot', 'money', 'get', 'blown', 'actual', 'fleeting', 'special', 'effect', 'Not', 'so', 'one', 'Time', 'time', 'jump', 'jump', 'filmmakers', 'jam', 'supernatural', 'right', 'camera', 'terrific', 'effect.Another', 'thing', '34', 'Grave', 'Encounters', '34', 'desperate', 'deranged', 'intensity', 'characters', 'Again', 'many', 'movies', 'will', 'have', 'characters', 'sweat', 'bemoan', 'unfortunate', 'circumstances', 'one', 'really', 'palpable', 'depressing', 'dread', 'characters', 'beg', 'forgiveness', 'mercy', 'salvation', 'truly', 'gut-wrenching', 'manor', 'chances', 'survival', 'erode.Once', 'movie', 'going', 'not', 'stop', 'Offering', 'plethora', 'frights', 'subtle', 'creepiness', 'overt', 'insanity', 'jumping', 'face', 'hallmark', 'great', 'horror', 'films', 'where', 'even', 'banal', 'scenes', 'are', 'filled', 'uncomfortable', 'tension', 'something', 'might', 'happen', 'moment.This', 'vintage', 'horror', 'best', 'watched', 'dark']",Grave Encounters

1452501,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B005B0QYMM,Mark Turner,"[5, 7]","Every so often a movie comes along that delights to no end. It's one of those movies that not everyone has heard of or that actually lives up to the hype that preceded it. When it happens, which is rare, it is one of the best times you have with a movie. Such is the case with GRAVE ENCOUNTERS.The movie falls into the category of lost footage films that became popular with both THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT and the PARANORMAL ACTIVITY films. Both were films put together with supposedly lost footage of some group or person that just now were being released. That happens here as a producer of reality television shows opens by telling us about the proposed series called ""Grave Encounters"". It was supposedly ahead of it's time, a reality show about ghost hunters before they were common.Led by Lance Preston (Sean Rogerson), the group investigates haunted locations in an attempt to offer proof of the paranormal. In reality as we watch this raw footage unroll we learn that it's all a gag to him and his crew, a group that doesn't actually believe in ghosts let alone having seen one. To them this is nothing more than a way to get on TV and be known, a way to make money.Along with Lance we have Matt White (Juan Riedinger) their tech specialist, Sasha Parker (Ashleigh Gryzko) a paranormal expert, camera man T.C. Gibson (Merwin Mondesir) and renowned psychic Houston Gray (Mackenzie Gray) who is actually an actor pretending to be a psychic. This group comes together to prove or debunk the supernatural in the series. With five episodes in the can they head out to their latest location, an abandoned asylum where nefarious tests were run on the inmates and where a few of them escaped to take down the doctor who committed these deeds and kill him.At first we see them try and coerce a handyman into claiming he saw a ghost for $20 and get to hear from a local historian who gives them the background on the location. Afterwards the current care taker unlocks the building and lets them in, padlocking the door from the outside once they're in (lockdowns are a part of several ghost hunting shows on air now). Matt sets up cameras in steady positions throughout the building and the crew has equipment of their own and the show begins filming.Nothing happens at first. The stage is being set for the viewer, that feeling of disbelief and the hope that something will happen only intensified by the setting and the use of night vision cameras shooting in the dark. If you hate hand held camera films you might not like this one but its not as intrusive as some have been in the past. There's a feeling of dread in the air as they walk the abandoned halls finding wheel chairs overturned gurneys. But little happens at first.When it does it's something simple. A tug, a push and finally we see Sasha's hair lifted by something not there. While this may seem spooky to us it's even worse for those involved as this is the first actual paranormal encounter that any of them have experienced. They are in over their head and soon find that these ghosts want to do more than just play with them.As things progress from bad to worse, they decided to stick together in the lobby and shut down the shooting. They have enough to put together and episode and have had enough. Sending Matt to pick up all the stationery cameras, he disappears and the group soon find themselves searching for him. And while doing so, they encounter more than they can handle.There's the set up of the movie. It was seen in the previews that were available before it was released. And for some reason it never got a wide or well played release to theaters which is sad. That's because this movie offers more scares and jumps, more creepy and chilling sequences than any movie I've seen in quite some time. While the similarly themed PARANORMAL ACTIVITY was gave me goose bumps, this one gave me more scares and had me more frightened at times. And even in scenes where you knew something was going to happen, the tension was so well developed that you felt relief after jumping.The actors are all quite believable. While none of them are well known recognizable faces it works to their advantage. It would be hard to believe someone like Tom Cruise as Lance knowing that he's, well, Tom Cruise. With unrecognizable faces you believe that maybe this really is lost footage. Okay not really but it helps make it more believable.Being a fan of horror films its rare for me to watch one and not feel cheated these days. So many go for the cheap scare, the gore extreme or the simple torture porn film, never relying on atmosphere. This movie drips with atmosphere. Although made on a small budget you'd never know while watching it. Instead you hope that no current group of ghost hunters have to experience what this team does. The movie is one of the best horror films I've seen in years. And having watched so many of them that's saying something.",5,TRULY SCARY!,1332201600,"03 20, 2012",2012,4921,"['so', 'often', 'movie', 'delights', 'end', 'one', 'movies', 'not', 'everyone', 'heard', 'actually', 'up', 'hype', 'preceded', 'When', 'rare', 'one', 'best', 'times', 'have', 'movie', 'Such', 'case', 'GRAVE', 'ENCOUNTERS.The', 'movie', 'category', 'lost', 'footage', 'films', 'became', 'popular', 'THE', 'BLAIR', 'WITCH', 'PROJECT', 'PARANORMAL', 'ACTIVITY', 'films', 'were', 'films', 'put', 'together', 'supposedly', 'lost', 'footage', 'group', 'person', 'just', 'now', 'were', 'being', 'released', 'here', 'producer', 'reality', 'television', 'shows', 'telling', 'proposed', 'series', 'called', 'Grave', 'Encounters', 'was', 'supposedly', 'ahead', 'time', 'reality', 'show', 'ghost', 'hunters', 'were', 'common.Led', 'Lance', 'Preston', 'Sean', 'Rogerson', 'group', 'haunted', 'locations', 'attempt', 'offer', 'proof', 'paranormal', 'reality', 'watch', 'raw', 'footage', 'unroll', 'learn', 'gag', 'crew', 'group', ""n't"", 'actually', 'believe', 'ghosts', 'let', 'alone', 'having', 'seen', 'one', 'nothing', 'more', 'way', 'get', 'TV', 'be', 'known', 'way', 'make', 'money.Along', 'Lance', 'have', 'Matt', 'White', 'Juan', 'Riedinger', 'tech', 'specialist', 'Sasha', 'Parker', 'Ashleigh', 'Gryzko', 'paranormal', 'expert', 'camera', 'man', 'T.C', 'Gibson', 'Merwin', 'Mondesir', 'renowned', 'psychic', 'Houston', 'Gray', 'Mackenzie', 'Gray', 'who', 'actually', 'actor', 'pretending', 'be', 'psychic', 'group', 'together', 'prove', 'debunk', 'supernatural', 'series', 'five', 'episodes', 'can', 'head', 'latest', 'location', 'abandoned', 'asylum', 'where', 'nefarious', 'tests', 'were', 'run', 'inmates', 'where', 'few', 'escaped', 'take', 'down', 'doctor', 'who', 'committed', 'deeds', 'kill', 'him.At', 'first', 'see', 'try', 'coerce', 'handyman', 'claiming', 'saw', 'ghost', '20', 'get', 'hear', 'local', 'historian', 'who', 'background', 'location', 'current', 'care', 'taker', 'building', 'padlocking', 'door', 'outside', ""'re"", 'lockdowns', 'are', 'part', 'several', 'ghost', 'hunting', 'shows', 'air', 'now', 'Matt', 'up', 'cameras', 'steady', 'positions', 'building', 'crew', 'equipment', 'own', 'show', 'filming.Nothing', 'happens', 'first', 'stage', 'being', 'set', 'viewer', 'feeling', 'disbelief', 'hope', 'something', 'will', 'happen', 'only', 'intensified', 'setting', 'use', 'night', 'vision', 'cameras', 'shooting', 'dark', 'hate', 'hand', 'held', 'camera', 'films', 'might', 'not', 'like', 'one', 'not', 'as', 'intrusive', 'have', 'been', 'past', 'feeling', 'dread', 'air', 'walk', 'abandoned', 'halls', 'finding', 'wheel', 'chairs', 'overturned', 'gurneys', 'little', 'happens', 'first.When', 'something', 'simple', 'tug', 'push', 'finally', 'see', 'Sasha', 'hair', 'lifted', 'something', 'not', 'there', 'may', 'seem', 'spooky', 'even', 'worse', 'involved', 'first', 'actual', 'paranormal', 'encounter', 'have', 'experienced', 'are', 'head', 'soon', 'find', 'ghosts', 'want', 'do', 'more', 'just', 'play', 'them.As', 'things', 'progress', 'bad', 'worse', 'decided', 'stick', 'together', 'lobby', 'shut', 'down', 'shooting', 'have', 'enough', 'put', 'together', 'episode', 'have', 'had', 'enough', 'Sending', 'Matt', 'pick', 'up', 'stationery', 'cameras', 'group', 'soon', 'find', 'searching', 'doing', 'so', 'encounter', 'more', 'can', 'handle.There', 'set', 'movie', 'was', 'seen', 'previews', 'were', 'available', 'was', 'released', 'reason', 'never', 'got', 'wide', 'well', 'played', 'release', 'theaters', 'sad', 'movie', 'more', 'scares', 'jumps', 'more', 'creepy', 'chilling', 'sequences', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'quite', 'time', 'similarly', 'themed', 'PARANORMAL', 'ACTIVITY', 'was', 'gave', 'goose', 'bumps', 'one', 'gave', 'more', 'scares', 'had', 'more', 'frightened', 'times', 'even', 'scenes', 'where', 'knew', 'something', 'was', 'going', 'happen', 'tension', 'was', 'so', 'well', 'developed', 'felt', 'relief', 'jumping.The', 'actors', 'are', 'quite', 'believable', 'none', 'are', 'well', 'known', 'recognizable', 'advantage', 'would', 'be', 'hard', 'believe', 'someone', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'Lance', 'knowing', 'well', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'unrecognizable', 'believe', 'maybe', 'really', 'lost', 'footage', 'Okay', 'not', 'really', 'make', 'more', 'believable.Being', 'fan', 'horror', 'films', 'rare', 'watch', 'one', 'not', 'feel', 'cheated', 'days', 'So', 'many', 'go', 'cheap', 'scare', 'gore', 'extreme', 'simple', 'torture', 'porn', 'film', 'never', 'relying', 'atmosphere', 'movie', 'atmosphere', 'made', 'small', 'budget', ""'d"", 'never', 'know', 'watching', 'Instead', 'hope', 'current', 'group', 'ghost', 'hunters', 'have', 'experience', 'what', 'team', 'movie', 'one', 'best', 'horror', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'years', 'having', 'watched', 'so', 'many', 'saying', 'something']",Grave Encounters

It opens with the premise of a guy who narrates our way into the ""recorded footage"". You see them pay off some guy to say there were ghosts, the theatrics they place to make the non-happenings as exciting. As the film progressed, I had realized they were not spoofing the show at all, but it starts to really get creepy. I think thats what made it scarier for me was that I was expecting to laugh.But whats starts as little incidents of rappings, lights going on and off and the usual ""what was that!?"" hysteria. But then the s**t really starts to hit the fan and it becomes unrelentless. Some of the logic gets thrown askew for scare tactics, and if you are critical of the human response factor to a situation such as this, then it might take away some of the appreciation of the scares. The one criticism I have of ALL found footage film is the inability to let go of the camera for any reason. So much so that people will die holding it. I dont get the impression is used only for a light source.It takes place in an abandoned mental hospital (of course!) And like all abandoned mental hospitals, bad things have happened there and have left an indelible scar upon its psyche. So, now the ghosts who were once patients run the asylum and are more mad than they were in life.There are lots of cameras and I must have missed some of the set up, but there seems to be lots of angles besides the single camera.The ""apparitions"" manifest are not really ghosts, but seems physical and demonic beings of a sort. So I am not sure what they are.

Much to their surprise and growing fears and anxiety the haunting turns out to be real and starts to grow in frequency and violence as the team now find themselves trapped within the hospital with apparently no way out,  you'll see as they try and find different routes out of the building but with growing anxiety and horror they see that whatever haunts the building can manipulate it as well causing hallways to be where there were none before making the team apparently go in circles and so forth.  The ghost and effects are pretty good but what really pulls the movie off is that it doesn't saturate the movie with those effects,  you see doors mysteriously open and close by themselves hear ungodly noises and voices see background movement and of course you will see a few ghosts in the movie that are really frighting and most that are pretty malevolent to our would be ghost hunters. The cast of actors actually did their roles pretty well giving the feel that this was actually happening to them and their own fears triggering greater anxiety and infighting as the group tries to make it out alive.  Again while the movie plays with the portable camera view throughout the movie it isn't as annoying as it was with the BW movie or the first Paranormal Activity movie was when they did their films,  but if you did 't like those movies solely on that one part then this movie isn't for you but if you like a good old fashion ghost movie with a decent cast and effects and with time on your hand I say check the movie out while it's not a blockbuster summer movie it's still one to at least watch once...",5,Surprisingly An Entertaining Movie For What It Was,1313971200,"08 22, 2011",2011,2245,"['nothing', 'really', 'do', 'time', 'decided', 'check', 'movie', 'not', 'expecting', 'much', 'surprise', 'movie', 'portable', 'camera', 'actually', 'movie', 'more', 'believable', 'lot', 'more', 'then', 'awful', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'basic', 'story', 'have', 'group', 'Ghost', 'hunters', 'who', 'are', 'doing', 'one', 'episodes', 'decided', 'take', 'case', 'haunted', 'psychiatric', 'hospital', 'less', 'then', 'popular', 'residents', 'history', 'mysterious', 'accidents', 'like', 'so', 'hoping', 'get', 'good', 'ratings', 'team', 'phony', 'psychic', 'have', 'caretaker', 'night', 'Much', 'surprise', 'growing', 'fears', 'anxiety', 'haunting', 'out', 'be', 'real', 'grow', 'frequency', 'violence', 'team', 'now', 'find', 'trapped', 'hospital', 'apparently', 'way', 'out', ""'ll"", 'see', 'try', 'find', 'different', 'routes', 'building', 'growing', 'anxiety', 'horror', 'see', 'building', 'can', 'manipulate', 'as', 'well', 'causing', 'hallways', 'be', 'where', 'were', 'none', 'making', 'team', 'apparently', 'go', 'circles', 'so', 'forth', 'ghost', 'effects', 'are', 'pretty', 'good', 'what', 'really', 'movie', 'off', ""n't"", 'saturate', 'movie', 'effects', 'see', 'doors', 'mysteriously', 'open', 'close', 'hear', 'ungodly', 'noises', 'voices', 'see', 'background', 'movement', 'course', 'will', 'see', 'few', 'ghosts', 'movie', 'are', 'really', 'frighting', 'most', 'are', 'pretty', 'malevolent', 'would', 'be', 'ghost', 'hunters', 'cast', 'actors', 'actually', 'did', 'roles', 'pretty', 'well', 'giving', 'feel', 'was', 'actually', 'happening', 'own', 'fears', 'triggering', 'greater', 'anxiety', 'infighting', 'group', 'make', 'out', 'alive', 'Again', 'movie', 'portable', 'camera', 'view', 'movie', ""n't"", 'as', 'annoying', 'was', 'BW', 'movie', 'first', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', 'movie', 'was', 'when', 'did', 'films', 'did', ""'t"", 'movies', 'solely', 'one', 'part', 'then', 'movie', ""n't"", 'like', 'good', 'old', 'fashion', 'ghost', 'movie', 'decent', 'cast', 'effects', 'time', 'hand', 'say', 'check', 'movie', 'out', 'not', 'blockbuster', 'summer', 'movie', 'still', 'one', 'least', 'watch', 'once']",Grave Encounters

(Any page that was picked up upside-down or backwards was shot as-is, with the cast trying to make sense of upside-down language or simply inserting five minutes of silence per blank page.) Now, I hasten to add that the above is an artist's conception of what may have happened during the filming of Grave Encounters; I have no inside information in this regard. But that's certainly what it felt like to me.Plot: A burgeoning Ghost Adventures-style show (we find out early on that this is footage that would have been edited down to form the sixth episode of the series) arranges to spend the night in a haunted asylum. Unlike normal procedure, when the caretaker of the asylum is supposed to ""lock them in overnight"", he actually does, so the team can't do things like get extra equipment from the truck. Or escape, when they find out that unlike the places they normally produce shows, this one really is haunted. All they can do is wait for sunrise, and the return of the caretaker......and I can't really get into what really made this movie so entirely awful without getting past that point, because that's where it all goes into the toilet--not that it wasn't most of the way there anyway, with acting that is at its best on the borderline of terrible, even worse lighting problems than one normally has with this sort of found-footage claptrap, etc. What I can tell you is that once we get to that point, the movie's sense of pace, which was already kind of wavering between ""dragging"" and ""mumblecore"", went over the cliff. I almost think I understand what Bros. Vicious were attempting to do with the pacing there, but without giving too much away, I'll say that it reminds me of the philosophy I have always believed James Joyce used when writing ""The Dead"" (if you want to write a story about dreadfully boring people, write a dreadfully boring story). And if so, I will give them that it takes guts to try something like that, because if it doesn't work, it's going to be a spectacular failure.Unfortunately, that's exactly what Grave Encounters is.

It's truly entertaining and while having an overall cheesy back story motivating the haunting, the movie holds your interest throughout. The story takes place in an abandoned mental institute, the history of which includes an unorthodox doctor who liked to experiment on his patients (wonder who the ultimate villain is...). This is where &#34;Ghost Adventures&#34; fans will get a kick out of the movie- A crew of G.A.C. like documentarians arrive at the campus of the old institute to film the latest episode of their show, &#34;Grave Encounters&#34;. As per &#34;Ghost Adventures&#34; rules, the leader of the crew announces his name (&#34;Zac Bagans&#34; will be ringing in your ears) and they are &#34;locked down&#34; in the building over night. The crew, along with a supposed psychic, kick off the night by trying to act frightened or intrigued by various mild happenings (as you imagine a real film crew would) and then suddenly begin experiencing actual frightening and mysterious occurances. Believing all they need to do is wait out the night, the crew depends on the lock down ending in the morning. But according to their watches, the time for the door to be unlocked comes and goes and no one is coming back for them. This seems to be a mistake on the caretakers part, until you see what happens when they attempt to break down the front door. Things escalate from this point on, in a never-ending night. The movie makes good use of the &#34;documentary&#34; style filming; we get the Blair Witch emotional breakdowns, poltergeist damaged lighting (leaving the crew in the dark), Cloverfield/Quarantine dropping and sliding of cameras on their side capturing the demise of the crew, and all the while the movie adds new horror visuals to the genre.What makes this movie good:- Good acting with developed, likable characters (my fav is the Tom Waits voiced psychic)- Fun references to well-known ghost hunting shows- Actually seriously creepy events (what's behind the &#34;front door&#34;/windows)- A mix of suspenseful/eerie and high-action/violent- Not boring and not predictable- Has a sequel!

They are doing a pilot series called `Grave Encounters' where they investigate haunted places and film the lot using the latest in ghost spotting technology, including Geiger counters and ectoplasm sensitive cameras - yeah right. Well any hoo they are on episode six - `the haunted asylum'- where they are at a former mental hospital. This was a place where experimental medicine was carried out on the patients, including frontier lobotomies, institutionalised abuse, suicide and murder - bwaaah!Led by naked self promotionalist, front man Lance Preston (Sean Rogerson) they pull out all the stops to ramp up the fright levels for the viewer, as Lance says `with slow motion and the right music behind it, everything is creepy'. So they go for a voluntary `lockdown' for eight hours on the building, the care taker will return at 6 am to let them out. They then rig up the building with cameras to take advantage of known `cold spots' to capture the other worldly goings on, then the bumps in the night begin and all of a sudden things aren't that funny anymore.This is a first outing for writers and directors `The Vicious Brothers', and I must say boys you have made quite an entrance. I was genuinely cacking myself on more than one occasion and what is more impressive is that as these are supposed to be edited down `found tapes' there is no music to aid in ramping up the fear factor. As this is yet another `found tape', film, there will inevitably be comparisons to the likes of `Blair Witch Project', `Cloverfield' and even `Troll Hunter'. This though deserves recognition in its own right as adding to the genre rather than reinventing or stealing from it. We do have lots of different camera types which are used to great effect to maximise the atmosphere of fear.It runs for an increasingly scary 92 minutes, but there is no filler here so not only is it about right in length, but it is one of those that almost feels much shorter.

They are to realize the folly too late, as they find themselves trapped inside the abandoned building.Directed by the Vicious Brothers (actually Collin Minihan and Stuart Ortiz), ""Grave Encounters"" looks like a cross between ""Paranormal Activity""-like so-called found-footage genre and a more orthodox ""haunted house"" horror film. The combination is not really a new idea, and the film spends too much time setting up the second half of it, where things get much better.In the first half of the film, what you will see you have seen somewhere else in a more effective way. Some sequences are creepy, but not scary enough for avid fans of the genre, who would find the film's scares predictable. This is not to say the mocumentary horror film is totally unoriginal. There is one intriguing idea about the surreal condition the hapless film crew is in - they are literally trapped inside the disused hospital in a supernatural way.This is when the film gets interesting.

I am a horror fan who does not care for general slash and gore movies, it has to have some substance to it.  This fit the bill for spooky.

So, there was some tongue and cheek humor in it, and I found that amusing.

She was the most afraid when something happened and the main guy that signed off was always looking for more film even as they delved into more obvious things that made it clear they were no longer just dealing with some comedic paranormal show.  There weren't many scares but the ones they had were genuine.  It wasn't a slasher flick, it wasn't quite psychological thriller because some elements were just too cliche but overall its a good movie and I will probably pay to see the sequel even though I know sequel sucks usually.  The last 20 minutes are the best, it doesn't use anything special.  It simply shows someone desperate.  I like how with the girl they didn't explain why she felt the way she did later on.  It let you make your own conclusions.  The end is good because it ties into the latter half of the movie with regard to another character they know.",5,"Well made ""documentary""",1368144000,"05 10, 2013",2013,1194,"['movie', 'really', 'well', 'made', 'fact', 'highly', 'unlikely', 'someone', 'black', 'would', 'even', 'be', 'part', 'let', 'alone', 'do', 'single', 'mission', 'stuff', 'was', 'told', 'do', ""'m"", 'black', 'yea', 'would', 'not', 'happen', 'otherwise', 'culturally', 'think', 'was', 'accurate', 'cast', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'role', 'especially', 'girl', 'was', 'most', 'afraid', 'when', 'something', 'happened', 'main', 'guy', 'signed', 'off', 'was', 'always', 'looking', 'more', 'film', 'even', 'delved', 'more', 'obvious', 'things', 'made', 'clear', 'were', 'no', 'longer', 'just', 'dealing', 'comedic', 'paranormal', 'show', 'were', ""n't"", 'many', 'scares', 'ones', 'had', 'were', 'genuine', 'was', ""n't"", 'slasher', 'flick', 'was', ""n't"", 'quite', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'elements', 'were', 'just', 'too', 'cliche', 'overall', 'good', 'movie', 'will', 'probably', 'pay', 'see', 'sequel', 'even', 'know', 'sequel', 'sucks', 'usually', 'last', '20', 'minutes', 'are', 'best', ""n't"", 'use', 'anything', 'special', 'simply', 'someone', 'desperate', 'how', 'girl', 'did', ""n't"", 'explain', 'why', 'felt', 'way', 'did', 'later', 'let', 'make', 'own', 'conclusions', 'end', 'good', 'latter', 'half', 'movie', 'regard', 'character', 'know']",Grave Encounters

It is a mock ghost hunting show.  So if ghost hunting shows is your thing, then you will relate immediately to what the movie is aiming for.
