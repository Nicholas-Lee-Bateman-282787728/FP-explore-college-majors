I started listening to Keith with the Golden Road a and Be Here albums; I was going through a personal transition and listening to his music really helped me define my life and my own transformation. About a five years ago I really got into listening to music from lesser known artists and accumulated many CDs and I forgot all about Keith. Last year during another life transition, I rediscovered Keith and bought all his other albums and his two concert DVDs. Once again - his songs have helped me through the transition of experiencing the passing of my father. I have bought this DVD and given them as a gift for my friends and family.",5,Keith Urban is such a great musician!!!,1374883200,"07 27, 2013",2013,719,"['Even', 'am', 'not', 'musically', 'inclined', 'whatsoever', 'enjoy', 'listening', 'music', 'started', 'listening', 'Keith', 'Golden', 'Road', 'Be', 'Here', 'was', 'going', 'personal', 'transition', 'listening', 'music', 'really', 'helped', 'define', 'life', 'own', 'transformation', 'five', 'years', 'ago', 'really', 'got', 'listening', 'music', 'lesser', 'known', 'artists', 'accumulated', 'many', 'CDs', 'forgot', 'Keith', 'Last', 'year', 'life', 'transition', 'rediscovered', 'Keith', 'bought', 'other', 'albums', 'two', 'concert', 'DVDs', 'Once', 'again', 'songs', 'have', 'helped', 'transition', 'experiencing', 'passing', 'father', 'have', 'bought', 'DVD', 'given', 'gift', 'friends', 'family']","Keith Urban: Love, Pain & the Whole Crazy World Tour - Live"

Or panning in and out, zooming all over the place. Do these people think as a society we can not sit still for more the 1 minute and focus on something (I blame this on new generation, video games, but that is a completly different topic) I mean when Keith is doing one of his amazing guitar solos, the cameraman is viewing the crowd or the back of Keith. It is absolutly ridiculous. You want to see him play, etc...I was nauseous after the first 5 minutes. I forced myself to watch it, only to be looking away every few minutes because you literally can get dizzy. The song choice/sound/band was great...but big disappointment on the filming end. So sad to say this one will go in the closet or be played on tv when I am doing something where I want to hear only music. His 1st concert was much better. More intimate. Word of advice to all these artists...TAKE CONTROL OF THE VIDEO PEOPLE!!!",2,Unsteady Camera,1359504000,"01 30, 2013",2013,1078,"['First', 'want', 'start', 'out', 'saying', 'how', 'much', 'love', 'Keith', 'Urban', 'musician', 'songwriter', 'etc', 'BUT', 'why', 'do', 'camera', 'men', 'find', 'necessary', 'change', 'frame', '4', '5', 'seconds', 'panning', 'zooming', 'place', 'Do', 'people', 'think', 'society', 'can', 'not', 'sit', 'still', 'more', '1', 'minute', 'focus', 'something', 'blame', 'new', 'generation', 'video', 'games', 'completly', 'different', 'topic', 'mean', 'when', 'Keith', 'doing', 'one', 'amazing', 'guitar', 'solos', 'cameraman', 'viewing', 'crowd', 'back', 'Keith', 'absolutly', 'ridiculous', 'want', 'see', 'play', 'etc', 'was', 'nauseous', 'first', '5', 'minutes', 'forced', 'watch', 'only', 'be', 'looking', 'away', 'few', 'minutes', 'literally', 'can', 'get', 'dizzy', 'song', 'choice/sound/band', 'was', 'great', 'big', 'disappointment', 'filming', 'end', 'So', 'sad', 'say', 'one', 'will', 'go', 'closet', 'be', 'played', 'tv', 'when', 'am', 'doing', 'something', 'where', 'want', 'hear', 'only', 'music', '1st', 'concert', 'was', 'much', 'better', 'More', 'intimate', 'Word', 'advice', 'artists', 'TAKE', 'CONTROL', 'THE', 'VIDEO', 'PEOPLE']","Keith Urban: Love, Pain & the Whole Crazy World Tour - Live"

1207345,A81P47EIXM8HA,B001K2KMFA,"Richardson ""Clarence""","[13, 13]","Hi Folks,I picked  this up at WalMart today for $10...I believe  they have an exclusive. What we have here is Keith in a BIG arena show as opposed to the smaller hall he played in the GRAMMY winning ""Livin Right Now"" DVD. I prefer the previous DVD by a great margin. The show is  more intimate...the filming  is  better that performance has more of a connection...perhaps this is due to the nature of how an artist has to perform in a huge arena and the problems with filming ..particularly the ""in the round"" section.  There are bonus features...mostly goof ups and a 15 minute making  of that is mostly a movie of Keiths face in different  cities...kinda strange actually. This is however on its own merits a terrific DVD and great 2 hour show and for $10 has to get a 5 star review.  If you have the other DVD this is  different enough to not be a waste of your time...if you have neither I'd certainly start with the first...and I almost forgot there is a sort of ""rough"" video of the song ""you look good in my shirt"" as another bonus...and did I mention..this kid Urban can play guitar...I mean he gets  busy on  that thing!!",5,a  five star DVD but not nearly as good as his first!,1226534400,"11 13, 2008",2008,1130,"['Hi', 'Folks', 'picked', 'up', 'WalMart', 'today', '10', 'believe', 'have', 'exclusive', 'What', 'have', 'here', 'Keith', 'BIG', 'arena', 'show', 'opposed', 'smaller', 'hall', 'played', 'GRAMMY', 'winning', 'Livin', 'Right', 'Now', 'DVD', 'prefer', 'previous', 'DVD', 'great', 'margin', 'show', 'more', 'intimate', 'filming', 'better', 'performance', 'more', 'connection', 'perhaps', 'due', 'nature', 'how', 'artist', 'perform', 'huge', 'arena', 'problems', 'filming', '..particularly', 'round', 'section', 'are', 'bonus', 'features', 'mostly', 'goof', 'ups', '15', 'minute', 'making', 'mostly', 'movie', 'Keiths', 'face', 'different', 'cities', 'kinda', 'strange', 'actually', 'however', 'own', 'merits', 'terrific', 'DVD', 'great', '2', 'hour', 'show', '10', 'get', '5', 'star', 'review', 'have', 'other', 'DVD', 'different', 'enough', 'not', 'be', 'waste', 'time', 'have', ""'d"", 'certainly', 'start', 'first', 'almost', 'forgot', 'sort', 'rough', 'video', 'song', 'look', 'good', 'shirt', 'bonus', 'did', 'mention..this', 'kid', 'Urban', 'can', 'play', 'guitar', 'mean', 'busy', 'thing']","Keith Urban: Love, Pain & the Whole Crazy World Tour - Live"
