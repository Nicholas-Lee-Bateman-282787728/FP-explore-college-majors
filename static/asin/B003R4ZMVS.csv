My wife is a 24 junkie and our DVR was so full of these episodes, up to 67 I think, that I was going nuts trying to have enough to space to record the shows I wanted to save.  She hasn't noticed that I have deleted most of the 24 episodes, though, as school had begun and she is busy with her teaching duties.  I will have all these episodes erased soon and will have to profusely apologize to her for doing so.  Then this Christmas I will give her this set and I will be forgiven for my transgressions.  She will be happy and I will be happy and all will be well.

1360736,AUCISQA1YXX86,B003R4ZMVS,Confederate,"[1, 5]","I'd never seen an episode of ""24"" when I purchased it, but for a hundred bucks (Gold Box sale) I figured, what the heck. It had been highly recommended, so I ordered away, and when it arrived I lay in bed with a portable player and watched the whole damn thing. Why did I use a portable player? Because my wife wanted to watch TV occasionally, and once I started watching the series, I couldn't stop. One disk after another, episode after episode. My life raced past me and my wife almost divorced me. Outings were a chore and I lived to come back to that blasted player.When I was done, I was done. And it changed my views. Water boarding? Yes I'm for it and break their knees if that doesn't work! Water boarding is for sissies. If a terrorist has a nuclear device hidden in a big city, are you telling me no one's going to water board him? You've got to be kidding! Start at his ankle and work your way up with a 9mm...and get Donald Sutherland on the phone!For those who haven't watched this series, get it at your own risk. It might ruin your marriage and turn you into a ranting right-winger! The series is selling for $165, which is chicken feed for the rush you'll experience. It's like being on a roller coaster ride that doesn't end. Oh, and don't get attached to any of the characters...that's very important. Got a terrorist? Strap him into a chair and make him watch the series...then give Donald Sutherland a Glock and have him walk into the room. I guarantee the guy will cooperate, and he'll probably need a change of underwear!Seriously, I bought the series thinking I was going to watch it then sell it (such is how I rationalize my purchases). But I'm going to wait another six months and watch it again. That'll be about a year and a half since I saw it the first time. Then I'll sell it...maybe. Being a Stargate SG-1 fan, look for some of the actors making brief appearances. The way things go in this series reminds me of Dorothy's observation in the Wizard of Oz: ""People come and go so quickly here!"" Anyway, enjoy, then lend it to one of your liberal friends!",5,Incredible...What a Rush!,1331596800,"03 13, 2012",2012,2085,"[""'d"", 'never', 'seen', 'episode', '24', 'when', 'purchased', 'hundred', 'bucks', 'Gold', 'Box', 'sale', 'figured', 'what', 'heck', 'had', 'been', 'highly', 'recommended', 'ordered', 'away', 'when', 'arrived', 'lay', 'bed', 'portable', 'player', 'watched', 'whole', 'damn', 'thing', 'Why', 'did', 'use', 'portable', 'player', 'wife', 'wanted', 'watch', 'TV', 'occasionally', 'once', 'started', 'watching', 'series', 'could', ""n't"", 'stop', 'One', 'disk', 'episode', 'episode', 'life', 'raced', 'wife', 'almost', 'divorced', 'Outings', 'were', 'chore', 'lived', 'come', 'back', 'blasted', 'player.When', 'was', 'done', 'was', 'done', 'changed', 'views', 'Water', 'boarding', 'Yes', ""'m"", 'break', 'knees', ""n't"", 'work', 'Water', 'boarding', 'sissies', 'terrorist', 'nuclear', 'device', 'hidden', 'big', 'city', 'are', 'telling', 'one', 'going', 'water', 'board', ""'ve"", 'got', 'be', 'kidding', 'Start', 'ankle', 'work', 'way', 'up', '9mm', 'get', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'phone', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'watched', 'series', 'get', 'own', 'risk', 'might', 'ruin', 'marriage', 'turn', 'ranting', 'right-winger', 'series', 'selling', '165', 'chicken', 'feed', 'rush', ""'ll"", 'experience', 'being', 'roller', 'coaster', 'ride', ""n't"", 'end', 'Oh', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'attached', 'characters', 'very', 'important', 'Got', 'terrorist', 'Strap', 'chair', 'make', 'watch', 'series', 'then', 'give', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'Glock', 'have', 'walk', 'room', 'guarantee', 'guy', 'will', 'cooperate', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'need', 'change', 'underwear', 'Seriously', 'bought', 'series', 'thinking', 'was', 'going', 'watch', 'then', 'sell', 'such', 'how', 'rationalize', 'purchases', ""'m"", 'going', 'wait', 'six', 'months', 'watch', 'again', ""'ll"", 'be', 'year', 'half', 'saw', 'first', 'time', 'Then', ""'ll"", 'sell', 'maybe', 'Being', 'Stargate', 'SG-1', 'fan', 'look', 'actors', 'making', 'brief', 'appearances', 'way', 'things', 'go', 'series', 'Dorothy', 'observation', 'Wizard', 'Oz', 'People', 'come', 'go', 'so', 'quickly', 'here', 'Anyway', 'enjoy', 'then', 'lend', 'one', 'liberal', 'friends']",N/A

Seinfeld reinvented comedy. 24 does for Serialized Action dramas what these shows did for their respective genres. What's great about 24 is that nothing like it had ever been seen before. It was bold. It was fresh. It was exciting. Each season consists of 24 one-hour long episodes. Jack Bauer, a federal agent, needs to stop some kind of act of terrorism (it's new every season.) But there's a twist: it takes place in real time. Each hour is an hour in the show universe as well, meaning, when all is said and done, each season is a day in the life of Jack Bauer. Meticulously assembled (at least in the first 5 or so seasons), the real-time aspect made the show. A drive across town might take half an episode, but it's frustrating when a life is on the line. Traffic lights are excruciating, especially if Jack's wife and daughter are kidnapped by terrorists, and we know in moments, they might die. If a terrorist claims they will attack at the end of the hour, the suspense will last until the end of the episode. Even better (or worse if you've started to watch late at night), is that each and every episode ends with a game-changing cliffhanger. You will wonder how the writers can come up with so many twists, but they consistently top themselves. The acting is phenomenal, although a little shaky in season one. As the characters were more fleshed out and the actors settled in, their parts were more believable, emotional, and heartfelt. The show is pretty violent and uses torture many times in order to extract information from terrorists. This was the subject of much criticism during its run, but I found it wasn't done in an excessive way to ""disturb"" viewers. It was done ""tastefully"" (or as tastefully as torture can be. It would have been unrealistic for a terrorist to just pour out his soul to Jack upon his asking. I didn't have a problem with it, but opinions will vary. Simply brace yourself for this. 24 also switched between multiple storylines: How the public reacts, how the White House responds, and how Jack tries to prevent the attacks. 24 was an iconic part of television in the past decade. Its best seasons were seasons 1, 2, 4, and 5, while its weakest were seasons 3 and 6. Towards the end of the series, the writers seemed to not show as much regard for the real-time aspect that defined the show in its earlier years. Rides from one end of town could take place during a commercial break, but the quality of the show was not hindered by this. 24's effects were profound, as it significantly impacted the future of television.

I had watched it on TV a couple of times and had never gotten into it - it's not a drop on in kind of show, really... is it? So I started at season 1 episode 1 and just went. By season 3 episode 1 I was completely convinced that I NEEDED to own this show... all of it... every last bit.I actually bought the set at Best Buy (sorry Amazon, I wanted it NOW!!!) and the price was a little more but was not outrageous.I opened the box to find all 8 days inside plus Redemption (the 2 hour 24 made for TV movie that falls between day 6 and day 7, naughty writers striking) and quietly tucked in the back of the box was a solitary disc in a paperboard cover full of special features.The TV to DVD transfer is flawless and the show looks beautiful. I own a Blu-Ray player and I don't know that Blu-Ray could do the picture much justice but admittedly the sound would probably be a touch better.The only thing I REALLY have to complain at all about is that I like box sets with little extras. For example, the complete X-Files box set had an episode review guide and a comic stuck into a ""drawer"" at the bottom of the box. Perhaps 24 could have done something similar? I digress however. My overall satisfaction far outweighs any petty dissatisfaction.Final synopsis? AWESOME!!! If you're on the fence about buying, just do it. This show is well worth it. ;D",5,"24?

The first couple seasons were very ground breaking with the ""real time"" format, and the fact that it was never afraid to kill off a character.  There were certainly hokey and dumb moments throughout the series, but I think on the whole the plots and the acting were very good.  I definitely think the series did try to hang on too long.  I think it would have stood up better if it ended after 4 or 5 seasons instead of going 8.  Like many I think that the 6th season was the weakest of the group.  While seasons 7 and 8 did help it recover, I do think it was a show that would have benefited from a shorter run, especially since there was talk of a possible movie long before the series ended.  Overall I think it was a well acted, well written series that was (especially at the beginning) very addicting.
