E Jackson,"[0, 0]","I was pleasantly shocked the moment I discovered there was actually a sequel to Shiloh, the lovable beagle puppy that I'm willing to met we ALL fell in love with.  If he's not the prettiest beagle I've ever seen, you'd have to go out of your way to find me a prettier one, haha.Shiloh 2- Shiloh Season contains the same setting as the first one.  You have a family living out in the country in an extremely small town with a neighbor who's less than friendly to say the least.  I *think* these are the same exact characters making a return.  Update- I was wrong.  The boy playing the young teenager is NOT the same boy from the first Shiloh.  I think everyone else is the same, though.Basically everyone has grown up a few years since the first movie (most noticeable in the kids of course) but unfortunately what may have seemed like a happy ending in the first one, we discover that the neighbor is once again up to his no good tricks and causes more problems and annoyances for the neighbors.The emphasis on Shiloh 2 is not necessarily on the neighbor wanting his beagle back (even though there's a few scenes where he searches for the beagle and the dog *almost* gets taken back, leading viewers into thinking the neighbor is trying to steal Shiloh while the family is asleep).  Not quite anything like that, but without spoiling what eventually happens, the storyline focuses around trying to make the neighbor less grouchy and more generous.It's quite the daunting task!  Attempting to change a man too old and stubborn to be a better person.  Easier said than done.  Even the father says it best ""You can't teach an old dog new tricks!""Overall, I can't help but notice the storyline and atmosphere is tamer and more relaxed than the first Shiloh film.  I'm not necessarily referring to the Shiloh beagle himself- the entire movie just lacks any particularly memorable segments.However, the reason I don't care is because I absolutely love the innocent Little House on the Prairie-like atmosphere.  We need more movies like these, and I really don't think this should be categorized under childrens movies because I'm a 30-year old man and I honestly didn't feel out of place watching Shiloh 2 last night.I highly recommend it.",5,more Shiloh,1322870400,"12 3, 2011",2011,2233,"['was', 'pleasantly', 'shocked', 'moment', 'discovered', 'was', 'actually', 'sequel', 'Shiloh', 'lovable', 'beagle', 'puppy', ""'m"", 'willing', 'met', 'ALL', 'fell', 'love', 'not', 'prettiest', 'beagle', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', ""'d"", 'have', 'go', 'way', 'find', 'prettier', 'one', '2-', 'Shiloh', 'Season', 'same', 'setting', 'first', 'one', 'have', 'family', 'living', 'out', 'country', 'extremely', 'small', 'town', 'neighbor', 'who', 'less', 'friendly', 'say', 'least', '*think*', 'are', 'same', 'exact', 'characters', 'making', 'return', 'Update-', 'was', 'wrong', 'boy', 'playing', 'young', 'teenager', 'NOT', 'same', 'boy', 'first', 'Shiloh', 'think', 'everyone', 'else', 'same', 'though.Basically', 'everyone', 'grown', 'up', 'few', 'years', 'first', 'movie', 'most', 'noticeable', 'kids', 'course', 'unfortunately', 'what', 'may', 'have', 'seemed', 'happy', 'ending', 'first', 'one', 'discover', 'neighbor', 'once', 'again', 'good', 'tricks', 'more', 'problems', 'annoyances', 'neighbors.The', 'emphasis', 'Shiloh', '2', 'not', 'necessarily', 'neighbor', 'wanting', 'beagle', 'back', 'even', 'few', 'scenes', 'where', 'beagle', 'dog', '*almost*', 'taken', 'back', 'leading', 'viewers', 'thinking', 'neighbor', 'trying', 'steal', 'Shiloh', 'family', 'asleep', 'Not', 'quite', 'anything', 'spoiling', 'what', 'eventually', 'storyline', 'trying', 'make', 'neighbor', 'grouchy', 'more', 'generous.It', 'daunting', 'task', 'Attempting', 'change', 'man', 'too', 'old', 'stubborn', 'be', 'better', 'person', 'Easier', 'said', 'done', 'Even', 'father', 'best', 'ca', ""n't"", 'teach', 'old', 'dog', 'new', 'tricks', 'Overall', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'notice', 'storyline', 'atmosphere', 'tamer', 'more', 'relaxed', 'first', 'Shiloh', 'film', ""'m"", 'not', 'necessarily', 'referring', 'Shiloh', 'beagle', 'himself-', 'entire', 'movie', 'just', 'particularly', 'memorable', 'segments.However', 'reason', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'absolutely', 'love', 'innocent', 'Little', 'House', 'Prairie-like', 'atmosphere', 'need', 'more', 'movies', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'should', 'be', 'categorized', 'childrens', 'movies', ""'m"", '30-year', 'old', 'man', 'honestly', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'place', 'watching', 'Shiloh', '2', 'last', 'night.I', 'highly', 'recommend']",N/A
665848,AY12DBB0U420B,B00005MKM8,Gary Peterson,"[0, 0]","The movie for last night was ""Shiloh Season,"" also known as ""Shiloh 2."" Shiloh is a beagle and the Shiloh movies (three in all) are boy/dog stories of the old fashioned kind. In the first episode (Shiloh), the young boy (Marty) rescued the little beagle from it's mean and cruel owner (Judd). The second episode, reported here, involved the boy and the dog with the background threat of Judd becoming ever more obnoxious and wanting his dog back. In addition, Judd was drinking ever-more heavily to the dismay of the little community. Then one day, Judd wrecked his pickup truck by driving it off a bridge. The hero in this case was Shiloh who found him and resulted in his ultimate rescue. It's a strange twist. In the first episode, the boy rescued the dog from his cruel owner, and in this episode, the dog rescued his former cruel owner.In any case, it's a good, low-key family type of movie lacking violence or harsh language. It's a slightly uplifting, slightly touching story. The photography of the small community and it's inhabitants was excellent. and the story had a nice flow to it, albeit somewhat shallow. Just think of it as a mild boy/dog story and enjoy it without major expectations.Gary Peterson",4,A Good Low-Key Family Movie.
