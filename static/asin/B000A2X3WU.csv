919484,A3TRZPS9Q7RLON,B000A2X3WU,"Dan Allen ""the canon""","[1, 1]","""I'll take you there"" is another good seriously playful film by Adrienne Shelly. It ranks right up there with ""Waitress,"" and ""Sudden Manhattan."" Ally Sheedy does a good job as in most of the films with her starring in them. The story is a little vague in my head, but remember it being a good love story, much like ""Waitress."" It's a pretty serious film with some funny moments and has all the touches of Shelly, humor, satire, awkward love, nerdiness, playfulness, etc. Not sure if this helps as a reccommI'll Take You Thereendation, but if you are a Shelly fan, give it a try. I guess none of her films that she directed are as strong as her acting in Hal Hartley's work, but they are enjoyable none the less. ""I'll take you there"" is one of those films which might not stick with you for long, but all the better to watch it again at some point. Shelly said ""she just wants people to have fun,"" and this comes through in all of her work. She was an outstanding person and is missed. I give it four stars, and it's a bargain for the price, and it's a good sleeper. Nuff' said.

Pluntze, Jr. ""pluntze2001""","[2, 2]","I just finished watching this extremely enjoyable and inventive (the flashback sequences are easily some of the BEST that I've ever seen integrated into a feature film!!) romantic-comedy earlier today -- and couldn't wait to rave about it!!! If it wasn't written with Ally Sheedy in mind (much the way ""The Breakfast Club"" evidently was), it might as well have been, because Sheedy's arguably at her absolute most endearing and sympathetic here (playing a ""broken"" woman who not only finds solace and strength ultimately from a man she really shouldn't even want to TALK to ever again -- and he, just as surprisingly, finding plenty of solace and strength in her in return).Anyone who even momentarily doubts the unceasingly smart writing AND directing instincts of the late Adrienne Shelly -- who, sadly, was murdered at age 40 (in 2006, in her Manhattan apartment) by a 19-year-old illegal immigrant from Ecuador: read more about Shelly at Wikipedia) -- definitely needs to watch ""I'll Take You There"" ... as well as Shelly's similarly-endearing ""Waitress"" and also ""Serious Moonlight"" (the latter adroitly directed by ""Suburgatory""/""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" actress Cheryl Hines).The acting, photography, music (Shelly even co-wrote some of the movie's songs -- just as she did for ""Waitress"" and a number of her other low-budget, people-oriented cinematic gems) and the rest of the film's aspects are all first-rate, with profuse kudos, especially, to the actress and actor who play Sheedy's grandmother and grandmother's boyfriend, respectively. Those two all by themselves are MORE than enough reason to rent, or even buy (I did the latter), this superb movie.
