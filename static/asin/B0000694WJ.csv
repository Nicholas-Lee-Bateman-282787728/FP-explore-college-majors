706482,A1IKOYZVFHO1XP,B0000694WJ,andy8047,"[8, 12]","Rick Latimer(James Belushi) is a high school English teacher who is promoted to principal many years after applying for the latter position. So he is sent to Brandel High,which is unlike other high schools. Most of the students there are troublemakers. They've been permanently expelled from other schools. They're into drugs,commit violent acts and other highly intolerable activities. So Rick with the help of security guard Jake Phillips(Lou Gossett Jr.) shape up the school. Brandel's worst student is Victor Duncan(Michael Wright),who's heavily armed and tries to gain control of the school. One student who makes no trouble at all is Arturo(Jacob Vargas). Arturo has a mild learning disability whose teacher is Hilary Orosco(Rae Dawn Chong). At first Hilary didn't like Rick at all. At one point in the film he brings several of the troublemakers into Hilary's classroom. That's where Hilary says to Rick,""I resent you. I resent what you're doing!"". In the opening scene,a drunken Rick demolishes the windshield,headlights and taillights of his ex-wife's boyfriend's car. The boyfriend is a divorce lawyer who represented Rick's ex-wife Kimberly. One Brandel student who straightened out was Emile(Troy Winbush). He was a member of Victor's dangerous gang and quit. In another scene,Emile crashes through a ceiling window,hanging by a rope. He ends up in the hospital and Rick visits him. Rick is so furious with Victor that Rick wishes Victor was in prison. Also there's Trina,who drops out after she's been busted for selling drugs in the restrooms. Rick tutors Trina. She willed to comply with the tutoring. Trina is an unwed mother with a small child living in a slum. Then Victor and his buddy go out to kill Rick. Rick,with Jake,beat the crap out of the mischievous pair and put them into police custody. Also,in another scene,Victor and his team disassemble Rick motorcycle,then beat the crap out of Rick(when Emile was a member). Arturo and his friends reassemble the bike and decorate it with Rick's helmet(""El Principal"" appears on the bike and helmet). Currently,Belushi is the star of the ABC sitcom ""According To Jim"". Gossett previously played the drill seargeant in 1982's AN OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN. Wright subsequently appeared in 1991's THE FIVE HEARTBEATS. Chong played C. Thomas Howell's girlfriend in 1986's SOUL MAN. Winbush later had a recurring role as one of Malcolm Jamal Warner's buddies on NBC's ""The Cosby Show"". Vargas subsequently appeared in 1995's GET SHORTY. Belushi's other films include REAL MEN,ABOUT LAST NIGHT,K-9,CURLY SUE,TAKING CARE OF BUSINESS,ONLY THE LONELY,RED HEAT and MR.

There's a glimpse back at the 1980's aquarter century later, in particular, the fascinating scenario ofan inner city high school comprised of a melting pot of variouscultures and backgrounds.Cast as an underdog, struggling with strained relationships ofvarious sorts (wife, elite school job,  family) and a hot temper,Belushi is assigned to an inner city school, as the director (inlieu of jailtime or fine for damaging the Porche owned by hiswife's new lover.)The personality of Belushi's character is to never turn down anychallenge, physical confrontation, being never too small for anysituation.Albeit a school setting, there's a great entertainment value ofsuspense, body to body fights, flashy motorcycle, humor, action,thrills, stunts, with an effective soundtrack (not at all dated)and a crystal clear cinematography and DVD transfer.A principal requires an agile body, a fitness prepared for bodycombat, a honed fighting technique and brute muscular strength,from the lessons learned, in counterpoint to delinquents andmockingbird detractors and unbelievers in the mission of educationin general.As with guerilla conflicts, the war is not winnable by the entityin whom authority and hierarchical power is invested unless the""hearts and minds"" are won  of the overall, numerous population atlarge - here, the student body.Belushi invests energy and stamina in turning around certaindifficult students - which is the opposite of earlier principalsstrategies, which was more of an accounting profession technique,of writing off ""bad assets"" as ""uncollectable"", unworthy,hopeless,  allowing  gang members to self-destruct, improving theincome statement (collecting a an educator's pay cheque), meaningthe status quo.Many ingredients are here ...ganja and pills, graffiti on schoolwalls, overt sexual innuendo, boom boxes, gangs, cliques, azoo-type school microcosm faced by youths who obviously haven'tseen too much of the world at that stage of their lives.The leader also deals with the ever-present grapevine from whichpeople form ideas about other people, profanity, chaos, gamblingactivities, absenteeism, intimidation, death threats, assaults,brass knucles, switch blades etc.The rival gang member says: ""You talk too much!"", played byMichael Wright, whose presence is a wild card -  keeping viewersinterested and guessing over 90 mins - as a rebel and gangster whowants to create and impose his own rules onto all others. Hispower is underlined with an omerta, such that, nobody will agreein identifying him in a police lineup.Belushi's organization skills are also put to the test, in face ofmaking do not only with the student body, but also with theadministrative personnel (teachers, staff)  who often are asrebellious and set in their ways as the students, in terms ofadhering to official school objectives, established methods,goals, and discipline.The film is a hurrah to principals who have a lot on their plates,relying on their mental and physical instincts and theirprofessional experience, as much as on the official powersdelegated  in order to success in their mission.",3,Great entertainment value surrounding role of leaders and managers,1261526400,"12 23, 2009",2009,3248,"['Principal', '1987', 'great', 'actors', 'James', 'Belushi', 'LouisGossett', 'Jr', 'high', 'critical', 'viewer', 'acclaim', '_', 'takingon', 'challenging', 'roles', 'glimpse', 'back', '1980', 'aquarter', 'century', 'later', 'particular', 'fascinating', 'scenario', 'ofan', 'inner', 'city', 'high', 'school', 'comprised', 'melting', 'pot', 'variouscultures', 'backgrounds.Cast', 'underdog', 'struggling', 'strained', 'relationships', 'ofvarious', 'sorts', 'wife', 'elite', 'school', 'job', 'family', 'hot', 'temper', 'Belushi', 'assigned', 'inner', 'city', 'school', 'director', 'inlieu', 'jailtime', 'fine', 'damaging', 'Porche', 'owned', 'hiswife', 'new', 'lover', 'personality', 'Belushi', 'character', 'never', 'turn', 'down', 'anychallenge', 'physical', 'confrontation', 'being', 'never', 'too', 'small', 'school', 'setting', 'great', 'entertainment', 'value', 'ofsuspense', 'body', 'body', 'fights', 'flashy', 'motorcycle', 'humor', 'action', 'thrills', 'stunts', 'effective', 'soundtrack', 'not', 'all', 'dated', 'crystal', 'clear', 'cinematography', 'DVD', 'transfer.A', 'principal', 'agile', 'body', 'fitness', 'prepared', 'bodycombat', 'honed', 'fighting', 'technique', 'brute', 'muscular', 'strength', 'lessons', 'learned', 'counterpoint', 'delinquents', 'andmockingbird', 'detractors', 'unbelievers', 'mission', 'educationin', 'general.As', 'guerilla', 'conflicts', 'war', 'not', 'winnable', 'entityin', 'whom', 'authority', 'hierarchical', 'power', 'invested', 'hearts', 'minds', 'are', 'won', 'overall', 'numerous', 'population', 'atlarge', 'here', 'student', 'body.Belushi', 'energy', 'stamina', 'turning', 'around', 'certaindifficult', 'students', 'opposite', 'earlier', 'principalsstrategies', 'was', 'more', 'accounting', 'profession', 'technique', 'writing', 'off', 'bad', 'assets', 'uncollectable', 'unworthy', 'hopeless', 'allowing', 'gang', 'members', 'self-destruct', 'improving', 'theincome', 'statement', 'collecting', 'educator', 'pay', 'cheque', 'meaningthe', 'status', 'quo.Many', 'ingredients', 'are', 'here', 'ganja', 'pills', 'graffiti', 'schoolwalls', 'overt', 'sexual', 'innuendo', 'boom', 'boxes', 'gangs', 'cliques', 'azoo-type', 'school', 'microcosm', 'faced', 'youths', 'who', 'obviously', 'too', 'much', 'world', 'stage', 'lives.The', 'leader', 'also', 'ever-present', 'grapevine', 'whichpeople', 'form', 'ideas', 'other', 'people', 'profanity', 'chaos', 'gamblingactivities', 'absenteeism', 'intimidation', 'death', 'threats', 'assaults', 'brass', 'knucles', 'switch', 'etc.The', 'rival', 'gang', 'member', 'talk', 'too', 'much', 'played', 'byMichael', 'Wright', 'presence', 'wild', 'card', 'keeping', 'viewersinterested', 'guessing', '90', 'mins', 'rebel', 'gangster', 'whowants', 'create', 'impose', 'own', 'rules', 'others', 'Hispower', 'underlined', 'omerta', 'such', 'nobody', 'will', 'agreein', 'identifying', 'police', 'lineup.Belushi', 'organization', 'skills', 'are', 'also', 'put', 'test', 'face', 'ofmaking', 'do', 'not', 'only', 'student', 'body', 'also', 'theadministrative', 'personnel', 'teachers', 'staff', 'who', 'often', 'are', 'asrebellious', 'set', 'ways', 'students', 'terms', 'ofadhering', 'official', 'school', 'objectives', 'established', 'methods', 'goals', 'discipline.The', 'film', 'hurrah', 'principals', 'who', 'have', 'lot', 'plates', 'relying', 'mental', 'physical', 'instincts', 'theirprofessional', 'experience', 'as', 'much', 'official', 'powersdelegated', 'order', 'success', 'mission']",N/A

The Principal may be a bit beyond what goes on in inner city or ghetto schools but most movies do that in other situations too. It showed how a principal who is a true leader can enlist others who also care to stand up to bullies and inspire his student body to work towards an education. It also portrayed others whom one might think were troublemakers because of the environment forced on them to be good kids. Jim Belushi and Louis Gossett are good in their roles and make their characters to be believable.
