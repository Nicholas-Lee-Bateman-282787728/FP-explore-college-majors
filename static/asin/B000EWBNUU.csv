979578,A1DVF1OMJDHTIP,B000EWBNUU,amoviefan,"[78, 87]","Why are all of Elizabeth Montgomery's films not on DVD (or VHS for that matter)? Amos was the only Liz movie ever put on VHS (how about the DVD, Sony?). What about Legend Of Lizzie Borden, A Case Of Rape, Second Sight: A Love Story or Between The Darkness And The Dawn, to name a few??? All of these films were released on VHS in the UK, why not here? I'll never understand how such a beloved star's work is almost impossible to come by. Sins Of The Mother is a good one. The quality of the DVD is pretty good (can't complain at that low price). Only flaw is a long blackout between one scene (a commercial break obviously). Sins Of The Mother gives Elizabeth the opportunity to play a real nasty role. Dale Midkiff is also very good as a tormented, almost pitiful rapist. Let's hope this is a sign that someone out there realizes IT'S TIME TO PUT ALL OF ELIZABETH MONTGOMERY'S FILMS ON dvd! Her fans want more!!!! PS- The DVD-- A Killing Affiar sold on Amazon is not her film-- it's another film with the same title (with Peter Weller).",4,Finally an Elizabeth Montgomery TV Movie on DVD!!!,1151884800,"07 3, 2006",2006,1037,"['Why', 'are', 'Elizabeth', 'Montgomery', 'films', 'not', 'DVD', 'VHS', 'matter', 'Amos', 'was', 'only', 'Liz', 'movie', 'ever', 'put', 'VHS', 'how', 'DVD', 'Sony', 'What', 'Legend', 'Lizzie', 'Borden', 'A', 'Case', 'Rape', 'Second', 'Sight', 'Love', 'Story', 'Between', 'Darkness', 'Dawn', 'name', 'few', 'films', 'were', 'released', 'VHS', 'UK', 'why', 'not', 'here', ""'ll"", 'never', 'understand', 'how', 'such', 'beloved', 'star', 'work', 'almost', 'impossible', 'come', 'Sins', 'Mother', 'good', 'one', 'quality', 'DVD', 'pretty', 'good', 'ca', ""n't"", 'complain', 'low', 'price', 'Only', 'flaw', 'long', 'blackout', 'one', 'scene', 'commercial', 'break', 'obviously', 'Sins', 'Mother', 'Elizabeth', 'opportunity', 'play', 'real', 'nasty', 'role', 'Dale', 'Midkiff', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'tormented', 'almost', 'pitiful', 'rapist', 'Let', 'hope', 'sign', 'someone', 'there', 'IT', 'TIME', 'TO', 'PUT', 'ALL', 'OF', 'ELIZABETH', 'MONTGOMERY', 'FILMS', 'ON', 'dvd', 'fans', 'want', 'more', 'PS-', 'DVD', 'Killing', 'Affiar', 'sold', 'Amazon', 'not', 'film', 'film', 'same', 'title', 'Peter', 'Weller']",Sins of the Mother
979579,A1PJZKEZQGREDY,B000EWBNUU,California Dreaming,"[0, 0]","I bought the book ""Son"" by the late-great Jack Olsen, but have not read it yet.  I believe that it is better to watch a movie first before reading the book.Like I've said before, almost everyone says, ""Oh, the book was so much better!"" when discussing film.  I find that to be problematic, because it's not entirely fair; it's comparing apples and oranges.  Books can be any length, although they are usually kept to 500 pages or fewer, while movies are usually condensed to two hours or less.  For this reason, filmmakers are often required to take liberties with a story, which doesn't bother me unless those liberties are taken for some political or otherwise unnecessary reason.  But if you read the book before seeing the movie, there is a tendency to nitpick with the film too much.  I didn't want to do that here.Assuming that this film is fairly accurate -- I will know almost for sure after I read ""Son"" -- the story itself is definitely interesting.  Naturally, the film's position is something like, ""Don't only blame the son for his actions.  After all, his mother was a psychopath too.""  While the male lead here is very good, especially for a made-for-TV film, the movie takes a neutral-to-slightly-negative view of him, so most likely the position is fair.  After all, he has to be blamed somewhat himself; lots of ""sons"" have lousy mothers but don't sexually assault anyone.And I've always been a fan of Elizabeth Montgomery, as I used to watch her on ""Bewitched"" when I was a kid.  She gives another nice performance as an unsympathetic character here, just like she did in the movie ""The Legend of Lizzie Borden.""  It's interesting to me that Ms. Montgomery so easily plays both good and bad characters equally; not many actors have that skill or range.  I wouldn't put her in that Meryl Streep category, but Ms. Montgomery is maybe only a couple notches below that.I'm not convinced of the accuracy, but there is one scene where a friend of Fred Coe's agrees to dispose of some evidence before the trial begins.  For you kids out there, listen up:  never destroy evidence, especially for a friend.  That would be a no-no, and you just might go to jail if you do it while trying to save somebody else's tail.  If I had a ""friend"" that asked the same from me, he wouldn't be a friend for long, I will assure you of that.I'll give a fairly strong recommendation, although I'm a little on the fence on that ""strong"" part until I read the book.  But I am looking forward to reading another good one from Mr. Olsen.",4,Sins of the Family,1380067200,"09 25, 2013",2013,2528,"['bought', 'book', 'Son', 'late-great', 'Jack', 'Olsen', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'yet', 'believe', 'better', 'watch', 'movie', 'first', 'reading', 'book.Like', ""'ve"", 'said', 'almost', 'everyone', 'Oh', 'book', 'was', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'when', 'discussing', 'film', 'find', 'be', 'problematic', 'not', 'entirely', 'fair', 'comparing', 'apples', 'oranges', 'Books', 'can', 'be', 'length', 'are', 'usually', 'kept', '500', 'pages', 'fewer', 'movies', 'are', 'usually', 'condensed', 'two', 'hours', 'less', 'reason', 'filmmakers', 'are', 'often', 'required', 'take', 'liberties', 'story', ""n't"", 'bother', 'liberties', 'are', 'taken', 'political', 'otherwise', 'unnecessary', 'reason', 'read', 'book', 'seeing', 'movie', 'tendency', 'nitpick', 'film', 'too', 'much', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'do', 'here.Assuming', 'film', 'fairly', 'accurate', 'will', 'know', 'almost', 'sure', 'read', 'Son', 'story', 'definitely', 'interesting', 'Naturally', 'film', 'position', 'something', 'Do', ""n't"", 'only', 'blame', 'son', 'actions', 'mother', 'was', 'psychopath', 'too', 'male', 'lead', 'here', 'very', 'good', 'especially', 'made-for-TV', 'film', 'movie', 'neutral-to-slightly-negative', 'view', 'so', 'most', 'likely', 'position', 'fair', 'be', 'blamed', 'somewhat', 'lots', 'sons', 'have', 'lousy', 'mothers', 'do', ""n't"", 'sexually', 'assault', 'anyone.And', ""'ve"", 'always', 'been', 'fan', 'Elizabeth', 'Montgomery', 'used', 'watch', 'Bewitched', 'when', 'was', 'kid', 'nice', 'performance', 'unsympathetic', 'character', 'here', 'just', 'did', 'movie', 'Legend', 'Lizzie', 'Borden', 'interesting', 'Ms.', 'Montgomery', 'easily', 'good', 'bad', 'characters', 'equally', 'not', 'many', 'actors', 'have', 'skill', 'range', 'would', ""n't"", 'put', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'category', 'Ms.', 'Montgomery', 'maybe', 'only', 'couple', 'notches', 'that.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'convinced', 'accuracy', 'one', 'scene', 'where', 'friend', 'Fred', 'Coe', 'agrees', 'dispose', 'evidence', 'trial', 'kids', 'there', 'listen', 'up', 'never', 'evidence', 'especially', 'friend', 'would', 'be', 'no-no', 'just', 'might', 'go', 'jail', 'do', 'trying', 'save', 'somebody', 'else', 'tail', 'had', 'friend', 'asked', 'same', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'friend', 'long', 'will', 'assure', 'that.I', ""'ll"", 'give', 'fairly', 'strong', 'recommendation', ""'m"", 'little', 'fence', 'strong', 'part', 'read', 'book', 'am', 'looking', 'forward', 'reading', 'good', 'one', 'Mr.', 'Olsen']",Sins of the Mother
