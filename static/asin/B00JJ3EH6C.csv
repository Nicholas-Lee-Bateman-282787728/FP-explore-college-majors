And after seeing him play so many unconventional characters it's nice to get a look at him in a more every-man kind of persona, this time in the new drama ""Locke"".With a car as its only set piece, it follows Ivan, a family man and construction manager who is in the midst of dealing with one of the biggest mistakes of his life. But while doing so, he must also orchestrate a huge challenge of his career over the phone that may determine whether he keeps his job. Desperately trying to do the right thing and attempting to keep his sanity as so many things are happening without his control, we see the series of events through his car windows, beautifully lit by streetlights and the vehicles around him.But as simple as it may sound, it sucks you in from the start and proves to be a compelling experience with Hardy delivering a subtle and genuine performance. And if you're looking for something a bit more engaging than the standard blockbusters out now, I would urge you to give it a shot.",4,Genuine and Compelling,1404777600,"07 8, 2014",2014,1302,"['are', 'few', 'actors', 'are', 'reliable', 'dynamic', 'Tom', 'Hardy', 'who', 'most', 'people', 'know', 'fantastic', 'turn', 'Bane', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'Rises', 'role', 'Inception', 'even', 'when', ""n't"", 'starring', 'front', 'center', 'always', 'bring', 'interesting', 'distinct', 'performances', 'table', 'seeing', 'play', 'so', 'many', 'unconventional', 'characters', 'nice', 'get', 'look', 'more', 'every-man', 'kind', 'persona', 'time', 'new', 'drama', 'Locke', 'car', 'only', 'set', 'piece', 'Ivan', 'family', 'man', 'construction', 'manager', 'who', 'midst', 'dealing', 'one', 'biggest', 'mistakes', 'life', 'doing', 'so', 'must', 'also', 'orchestrate', 'huge', 'challenge', 'career', 'phone', 'may', 'determine', 'job', 'Desperately', 'trying', 'do', 'right', 'thing', 'attempting', 'keep', 'sanity', 'so', 'many', 'things', 'are', 'happening', 'control', 'see', 'series', 'events', 'car', 'windows', 'beautifully', 'lit', 'streetlights', 'vehicles', 'around', 'him.But', 'as', 'simple', 'may', 'sound', 'start', 'be', 'compelling', 'experience', 'Hardy', 'delivering', 'subtle', 'genuine', 'performance', ""'re"", 'looking', 'something', 'bit', 'more', 'engaging', 'standard', 'blockbusters', 'out', 'now', 'would', 'urge', 'give', 'shot']",Locke Digital
1696655,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B00JJ3EH6C,C. Sawin,"[20, 21]","&#34;Locke&#34; is Tom Hardy in a car sifting through his Rolodex of contacts and being on the phone for 80-minutes straight. It's the type of concept similar to what Rodrigo Cortes was going for in &#34;Buried.&#34; &#34;Locke&#34; may be a low-budget film that's simple in execution, but it allows its audience to rely on the actor's performance to get them through the film.Hardy's on-screen presence in Steven Knight's dramatic thriller is riveting. Ivan Locke is ridiculously calm and composed with the life altering decisions he's made at the beginning of the film, but the events that transpire over the phone on Ivan's strange but determined journey not only pluck at his emotions but his sanity as well. Locke's arguments with his reflection in the rear-view mirror as he targets his neglectful father are disturbingly outstanding. Those powerful sequences show that Hardy needs nothing but a working camera pointed squarely at him in order to showcase his exquisite talent as a leading man.The resolution of &#34;Locke&#34; leaves a lot to be desired even with Hardy's strong performance. The drama that unfolds is very realistic and believable. It seems like it could happen to anyone. While the plot is intricate, the plot points remain within the realm of reality and nothing stands in the way of the film's energetic pace. But you expect more when the ending rolls around. While certain things are wrapped up, the film feels a little short as it could have allowed another 10 or 20 minutes to be fully satisfying.Witnessing a man being pushed to his breaking point is the best part of &#34;Locke.&#34; Tom Hardy delivers an emotionally exhausting and attention demanding performance that's one of the best of the English actor's career. However the film fizzles out in its final moments as it offers dissatisfying closure. &#34;Locke&#34; wastes little time accelerating into exceptional territory, but it slows down and makes a sharp turn onto an under construction detour that slows the film down bringing it to an abrupt halt.",4,A frustrating yet extraordinary dramatic thriller,1399593600,"05 9, 2014",2014,2043,"['34', 'Locke', '34', 'Tom', 'Hardy', 'car', 'sifting', 'Rolodex', 'contacts', 'being', 'phone', '80-minutes', 'straight', 'type', 'concept', 'similar', 'what', 'Rodrigo', 'Cortes', 'was', 'going', '34', 'Buried.', '34', '34', 'Locke', '34', 'may', 'be', 'low-budget', 'film', 'simple', 'execution', 'audience', 'rely', 'actor', 'performance', 'get', 'film.Hardy', 'on-screen', 'presence', 'Steven', 'Knight', 'dramatic', 'thriller', 'riveting', 'Ivan', 'Locke', 'ridiculously', 'calm', 'composed', 'life', 'altering', 'decisions', 'made', 'beginning', 'film', 'events', 'transpire', 'phone', 'Ivan', 'strange', 'determined', 'journey', 'not', 'only', 'pluck', 'emotions', 'sanity', 'as', 'well', 'Locke', 'arguments', 'reflection', 'rear-view', 'mirror', 'neglectful', 'father', 'are', 'disturbingly', 'outstanding', 'powerful', 'sequences', 'show', 'Hardy', 'nothing', 'working', 'camera', 'pointed', 'squarely', 'order', 'showcase', 'exquisite', 'talent', 'leading', 'man.The', 'resolution', '34', 'Locke', '34', 'lot', 'be', 'desired', 'even', 'Hardy', 'strong', 'performance', 'drama', 'very', 'realistic', 'believable', 'could', 'happen', 'anyone', 'plot', 'intricate', 'plot', 'points', 'remain', 'realm', 'reality', 'nothing', 'stands', 'way', 'film', 'energetic', 'pace', 'expect', 'more', 'when', 'ending', 'rolls', 'around', 'certain', 'things', 'are', 'wrapped', 'up', 'film', 'little', 'short', 'could', 'have', 'allowed', '10', '20', 'minutes', 'be', 'fully', 'satisfying.Witnessing', 'man', 'being', 'pushed', 'breaking', 'point', 'best', 'part', '34', 'Locke.', '34', 'Tom', 'Hardy', 'emotionally', 'exhausting', 'attention', 'demanding', 'performance', 'one', 'best', 'English', 'actor', 'career', 'However', 'film', 'out', 'final', 'moments', 'dissatisfying', 'closure', '34', 'Locke', '34', 'wastes', 'little', 'time', 'accelerating', 'exceptional', 'territory', 'down', 'sharp', 'turn', 'construction', 'detour', 'film', 'down', 'bringing', 'abrupt', 'halt']",Locke Digital

1696657,A1K3SFTY71SH6Q,B00JJ3EH6C,D. Holmes,"[13, 14]","The night before the largest project of his career, Ivan Locke, a respected Birmingham construction foreman and a loving husband with two sons, does not go home.  He instead drives nonstop to London.  He has made a complicated and profound decision:  seven months prior, in a rare ethical lapse, he slept with an older woman while traveling, and she is now delivering his child.  He will be there for the birth.  During the 90-minute drive south, he is on the phone, readying the next morning's events&#8212;there are machines to be tested and road closures confirmed&#8212;while also arguing for and trying to protect the warm home life now evaporating in his abrupt absence.  The title character is the story's only physical presence (his family members and colleagues are represented by their diverse, distraught, frustrated, inquisitive voices) and invites or even demands a major performance capable of riveting the audience without fail.  The magnificent Tom Hardy is the right choice then.  With his measured, Welsh-accented voice and demonstrative face, he reveals the soul of a previously-in-control man on the verge of despair and destruction whose only option is to combat each emerging crisis with logic and a practical touch.  This is the story of a man whose iron sense of moral purpose is bruised, teased, and otherwise upended at every turn by circumstance, memory, and the volatility of the people upon whom he relies even as he hurts them, and Hardy conveys the internal ache in a way both majestic and subtle.Also deserving of significant praise is writer and director Steven Knight, who made a fantastic directorial debut last year with Redemption (also known as Hummingbird), a dramatic action film far too few people in the United States saw.  Here, as a writer, Knight excels at crafting extended conversations which are elegant and revelatory, yet also natural in their flow and at times profane.  Where other limited-time-and-space films such as Phone Booth and Buried utilize extreme life-or-death situations to generate suspense, Knight does it through simple, but powerful human drama and a grounded portrayal of contemporary urban anxiety.  As a director, he, of course, has limited visual elements with which to populate the frame, but he finds a thousand and one ways to exploit the hypnotic and otherworldly quality of a well-lit roadway at night&#8212;a commonplace, yet alien environment of concrete and reflection&#8212;while also knowing when to relax his camera and train it directly and without pretense on his most spectacular instrument:  Hardy.",5,Tom Hardy is magnificent in this subtle suspense gem,1399680000,"05 10, 2014",2014,2585,"['night', 'largest', 'project', 'career', 'Ivan', 'Locke', 'respected', 'Birmingham', 'construction', 'foreman', 'loving', 'husband', 'two', 'sons', 'not', 'go', 'home', 'instead', 'nonstop', 'London', 'made', 'complicated', 'profound', 'decision', 'seven', 'months', 'prior', 'rare', 'ethical', 'lapse', 'slept', 'older', 'woman', 'traveling', 'now', 'delivering', 'child', 'will', 'be', 'there', 'birth', '90-minute', 'drive', 'south', 'phone', 'readying', 'next', 'morning', 'events', '8212', 'are', 'machines', 'be', 'tested', 'road', 'closures', 'confirmed', '8212', 'also', 'arguing', 'trying', 'protect', 'warm', 'home', 'life', 'now', 'evaporating', 'abrupt', 'absence', 'title', 'character', 'story', 'only', 'physical', 'presence', 'family', 'members', 'colleagues', 'are', 'represented', 'diverse', 'distraught', 'frustrated', 'inquisitive', 'voices', 'even', 'major', 'performance', 'capable', 'riveting', 'audience', 'fail', 'magnificent', 'Tom', 'Hardy', 'right', 'choice', 'then', 'measured', 'Welsh-accented', 'voice', 'demonstrative', 'face', 'soul', 'previously-in-control', 'man', 'verge', 'despair', 'destruction', 'only', 'option', 'combat', 'emerging', 'crisis', 'logic', 'practical', 'touch', 'story', 'man', 'iron', 'sense', 'moral', 'purpose', 'bruised', 'teased', 'otherwise', 'upended', 'turn', 'circumstance', 'memory', 'volatility', 'people', 'whom', 'even', 'Hardy', 'conveys', 'internal', 'ache', 'way', 'majestic', 'subtle.Also', 'deserving', 'significant', 'praise', 'writer', 'director', 'Steven', 'Knight', 'who', 'made', 'fantastic', 'directorial', 'debut', 'last', 'year', 'Redemption', 'also', 'known', 'Hummingbird', 'dramatic', 'action', 'film', 'far', 'too', 'few', 'people', 'United', 'States', 'saw', 'Here', 'writer', 'Knight', 'excels', 'crafting', 'extended', 'conversations', 'are', 'elegant', 'revelatory', 'yet', 'also', 'natural', 'flow', 'times', 'profane', 'Where', 'other', 'limited-time-and-space', 'films', 'such', 'Phone', 'Booth', 'Buried', 'utilize', 'extreme', 'life-or-death', 'situations', 'generate', 'suspense', 'Knight', 'simple', 'powerful', 'human', 'drama', 'grounded', 'portrayal', 'contemporary', 'urban', 'anxiety', 'director', 'course', 'limited', 'visual', 'elements', 'populate', 'frame', 'thousand', 'one', 'ways', 'exploit', 'hypnotic', 'otherworldly', 'quality', 'well-lit', 'roadway', 'night', '8212', 'commonplace', 'yet', 'alien', 'environment', 'concrete', 'reflection', '8212', 'also', 'knowing', 'when', 'relax', 'camera', 'train', 'directly', 'pretense', 'most', 'spectacular', 'instrument', 'Hardy']",Locke Digital

I am not going to tell you what the story is about because everybody else's review does that and spoils it for you.So I will just say that if you are a Tom Hardy fan, you are going to see arguably his best career performance to date. If you are not a Tom Hardy fan, this film will make you one. Originally conceived as a stage play, Steven Knight and Tom Hardy, Knight's only choice for the lead, came up with this unique way of telling a story.Hardy drives in real time. In real traffic. On real phones. The supporting cast are holed up in a hotel room on the other end. Tom's head cold is real. He is really driving, and the teleprompter is where the visor would be. Tom said he had to watch the road traffic so there was a bit of improv going on at times. LOL  The shooting was done every night for a week, over and over, so Knight could select the best one. Cameras were attached to the vehicle to get every conceivable angle.The technical aspects of this film will astound you.  Tom Hardy's performance will astound you. The supporting actors, all only voices on the phone line,  will astound you.  The story is bittersweet and sad and uplifting simultaneously. You will love Ivan Locke, or despise him, or judge him, or admire him. He gives you an opportunity to feel all of those.A thundering horn-blowing Five Stars for this masterpiece of film.",5,Locked In,1404777600,"07 8, 2014",2014,1368,"['SPOILER', 'Alert', 'am', 'not', 'going', 'tell', 'what', 'story', 'everybody', 'else', 'review', 'spoils', 'you.So', 'will', 'just', 'say', 'are', 'Tom', 'Hardy', 'fan', 'are', 'going', 'see', 'arguably', 'best', 'career', 'performance', 'date', 'are', 'not', 'Tom', 'Hardy', 'fan', 'film', 'will', 'make', 'one', 'Originally', 'conceived', 'stage', 'play', 'Steven', 'Knight', 'Tom', 'Hardy', 'Knight', 'only', 'choice', 'lead', 'came', 'up', 'unique', 'way', 'telling', 'story.Hardy', 'drives', 'real', 'time', 'real', 'traffic', 'real', 'phones', 'supporting', 'cast', 'are', 'holed', 'up', 'hotel', 'room', 'other', 'end', 'Tom', 'head', 'cold', 'real', 'really', 'driving', 'teleprompter', 'where', 'visor', 'would', 'be', 'Tom', 'said', 'had', 'watch', 'road', 'traffic', 'was', 'bit', 'improv', 'going', 'times', 'LOL', 'shooting', 'was', 'done', 'night', 'week', 'over', 'so', 'Knight', 'could', 'select', 'best', 'one', 'Cameras', 'were', 'attached', 'vehicle', 'get', 'conceivable', 'angle.The', 'technical', 'aspects', 'film', 'will', 'astound', 'Tom', 'Hardy', 'performance', 'will', 'astound', 'supporting', 'actors', 'only', 'voices', 'phone', 'line', 'will', 'astound', 'story', 'bittersweet', 'sad', 'uplifting', 'simultaneously', 'will', 'love', 'Ivan', 'Locke', 'despise', 'judge', 'admire', 'opportunity', 'feel', 'those.A', 'thundering', 'horn-blowing', 'Five', 'Stars', 'masterpiece', 'film']",Locke Digital

Moore,"[2, 2]","In Steven Knight's &#34;Locke,&#34; a man's entire life unravels during one ninety-minute drive down an English motorway, via a series of Bluetooth phone conversations with several people: his assistant, his boss, his sons, his wife, and another woman. To say any more would be to give too much away. You can justly call &#34;Locke&#34; a digital-age version of &#34;Sorry, Wrong Number,&#34; except that &#34;Locke&#34; is even more claustrophobic than the earlier film. Except for an opening shot at the massive construction site where Ivan Locke (Tom Hardy) is a supervisor, the entire film takes place behind the wheel of Locke's BMW. Thanks to Knight, Hardy and cinematographer Haris Zambarloukos, it is a dazzling experience. We learn that Locke is a man who prides himself on being a problem-solver, the one who holds things together when everyone else is panicking. And we see what happens to him when life throws him a situation that even he can't solve.Above all, &#34;Locke&#34; is a triumph for Hardy, one of Britain's most impressive younger actors. Hardy has already won a substantial fan base through his supporting performances in such films as &#34;Inception&#34; and &#34;The Dark Knight Rises.&#34; Here, he proves he can keep an audience riveted just sitting still in the driver's seat, using only his eyes and voice. We come to like Ivan Locke, for all his flaws, very much indeed, so that the fragile wand of hope that Fate holds out to him in the end feels completely earned. &#34;Locke&#34; is a must-see for adventurous filmgoers.",5,"""Sorry, Wrong Number"" for the digital age.",1400976000,"05 25, 2014",2014,1555,"['Steven', 'Knight', '34', 'Locke', '34', 'man', 'entire', 'life', 'unravels', 'one', 'ninety-minute', 'drive', 'down', 'English', 'motorway', 'series', 'Bluetooth', 'phone', 'conversations', 'several', 'people', 'assistant', 'boss', 'sons', 'wife', 'woman', 'say', 'more', 'would', 'be', 'give', 'too', 'much', 'away', 'can', 'justly', 'call', '34', 'Locke', '34', 'digital-age', 'version', '34', 'Sorry', 'Wrong', 'Number', '34', '34', 'Locke', '34', 'even', 'more', 'claustrophobic', 'earlier', 'film', 'opening', 'shot', 'massive', 'construction', 'site', 'where', 'Ivan', 'Locke', 'Tom', 'Hardy', 'supervisor', 'entire', 'film', 'place', 'wheel', 'Locke', 'BMW', 'Thanks', 'Knight', 'Hardy', 'cinematographer', 'Haris', 'Zambarloukos', 'dazzling', 'experience', 'learn', 'Locke', 'man', 'who', 'being', 'problem-solver', 'one', 'who', 'things', 'together', 'when', 'everyone', 'else', 'panicking', 'see', 'what', 'when', 'life', 'situation', 'even', 'ca', ""n't"", 'solve.Above', '34', 'Locke', '34', 'triumph', 'Hardy', 'one', 'Britain', 'most', 'impressive', 'younger', 'actors', 'Hardy', 'already', 'won', 'substantial', 'fan', 'base', 'supporting', 'performances', 'such', 'films', '34', 'Inception', '34', '34', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'Rises.', '34', 'Here', 'can', 'keep', 'audience', 'riveted', 'just', 'sitting', 'still', 'driver', 'seat', 'using', 'only', 'eyes', 'voice', 'come', 'like', 'Ivan', 'Locke', 'flaws', 'very', 'much', 'indeed', 'fragile', 'wand', 'hope', 'Fate', 'out', 'end', 'completely', 'earned', '34', 'Locke', '34', 'must-see', 'adventurous', 'filmgoers']",Locke Digital

As the movie opens, without any introduction of background, we see Locke get into his BMW X5 and drive off and onto the freeway (or &#34;motorway&#34; as they call it in England). Locke immediately gets on his car phone (hands free, I might add), and pretty soon we start getting the picture. On the one hand, Locke is apparently a construction foreman (or &#34;master&#34; as they call it in England), dealing with last minute issues before concrete is being poured for a skyscraper in London. All kinds of professional and work issues arise of course. On the other hand, Locke also is dealing with a bunch of personal and relationship issues, stemming from a one-night stand/affair he had. To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: first of all, kudos to writer-director Steve Knight, who came up with this concept and then executed it brilliantly. But the even bigger complement must go to Tom Hardy's one man tour de force. Imagine this: Hardy is the only actor appearing on screen, and the scenery is his car and the motorway, that's it. Somehow Hardy manages to keep our interest, and then some. One could call this a &#34;one trick pony&#34; and indeed it carries the risk that the movie will be known for only that, but when you see it playing out on the screen, it simply WORKS. Hardy's acting performance is truly one for the books.&#34;Locke&#34; opened today at my local art-house theatre here in Cincinnati, and I went to see it right away. The late matinee screening where I saw this at was quite well attended, so that is good news.

Locke (Tom Hardy) is driving to London to see the birth of his child by a one night stand. It will take him about 90 minutes, and like a Hemingway novel, it is done in real time. Ivan spends almost the entire trip on the phone and when he is not on the phone he talks to his deceased father.Ivan decides he needs to do the right thing by being at the birth of his child because of his poor relationship with his father. He imagines everything will be good afterwards. He takes calls from his son watching the football match. He has told his wife what has happened, and she is not dealing with it very well. The woman giving birth has issues as he talks to her and the hospital staff. Ivan is the foreman over a large concrete pour that will happen in his absence. He has to deal with corporate while micro managing a drinking worker through his job over the phone. He does so very cool and collectively, yet things don't go his way.The film never went anywhere.

1696663,AYB0IXBPBJ20A,B00JJ3EH6C,"Travis Hopson ""shoguntee""","[3, 3]","Whether he's the center of attention like in his furious breakthrough Bronson; under a mask and unintelligible as in The Dark Knight Rises; or part of the Inception ensemble, it's hard to take one's eyes off of Tom Hardy. More often than not it's Hardy's physical prowess that stands out; he's always had something of an animal presence about him that's undeniable. But no film has asked Hardy to keep the audience&#8217;s attention quite like Steven Knight's sterling single-location thriller, Locke, and it makes the case for Hardy as one of the most compelling actors working today.The single-location film is a tough nut for even the most veteran director, but Knight shows an uncanny confidence in only his second feature behind the camera. Known mainly for his gritty screenplays such as Eastern Promises and Dirty Pretty Things, Knight shows his precise hand and a ton of guts in guiding a movie set entirely behind the wheel of a moving vehicle. It's a different sort of role for Hardy, as well, one that demands an exacting level of emotional control for his is the only face we're going to see, and one slip up means the whole thing could go astray.Hardy is Ivan Locke, a top construction expert on the verge of the biggest concrete pour in Europe's history. It will make or break the company he works for, and on the eve it's to take place he hops in his BMW and skips town to London. Understandably, this freaks out his colleagues who are used to relying on the typically dependable Locke, but he's determined to get somewhere important. All we know at first is that it's to see a woman (voiced by Olivia Colman), and it must be that night. We also know that Locke has a family; a wife (Ruth Wilson) who is waiting for him at home and two boys (Tom Holland and Bill Milner) who are anxious for Dad's arrival so they can watch the big soccer match.But Locke isn't coming home, and it's clear that this man, who seems like a good and decent person, is risking everything to fix a major screw-up. His personal and professional life is at stake through every mile of his journey, and Knight, who also penned the screenplay, ratchets up the tension or flips it around with every phone call Locke receives. It may not sound all that interesting to watch Hardy talk on his car phone for the duration, but Knight smartly doles out just enough new information that nothing stays dormant for long. What becomes obvious is that Locke is a man who has always prided himself on self-control, and a momentary lapse in judgment has shaken his sense of self.  &#34;I'll fix it and it'll all go back to normal&#34;, he says with a certainty that borders on delusional. As Locke scrambles to assuage the fears of his nervous assistant, who must now handle the job alone, he must also calm down the woman he's racing towards while trying to hold his family together. The less said about the exact details the better, as Knight and Hardy guide us along deliberately through Locke's soulful journey. There are details revealed about Locke that will constantly alter our perceptions of him and the people who populate his life. His atypical actions have everyone on edge, and they bring us to the edge our seats, too.It's rare that Locke takes us outside of the vehicle, but when he does the gorgeous, nocturnal cinematography only deepens the mood; sinking us further into Locke's plight. It's amazing how much one can learn about a man in a scant 90 minutes, but we know everything about Locke by the time the movie is done. All of his failings and strengths laid bare for us to see and judge; we know why he seems so eager to make hard decisions regardless of the personal cost. Where the story skids off the road is during Locke's imagined conversations with his deadbeat father. They seem like overkill, making a point about Locke's character that Hardy is more than capable of getting across. His performance here is understated, controlled, and he owns every single moment.Other than a few false notes, Locke is impressively bold; as thrilling as it is resonant. If nothing else it marks daring new territory for Hardy and Knight alike.",4,Riveting Nocturnal Journey of the Soul,1400976000,"05 25, 2014",2014,4133,"['center', 'attention', 'furious', 'Bronson', 'mask', 'unintelligible', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'Rises', 'part', 'Inception', 'ensemble', 'hard', 'take', 'one', 'eyes', 'Tom', 'Hardy', 'More', 'often', 'not', 'Hardy', 'physical', 'prowess', 'out', 'always', 'had', 'something', 'animal', 'presence', 'undeniable', 'film', 'asked', 'Hardy', 'keep', 'audience', '8217', 'attention', 'quite', 'Steven', 'Knight', 'sterling', 'single-location', 'thriller', 'Locke', 'case', 'Hardy', 'one', 'most', 'compelling', 'actors', 'working', 'today.The', 'single-location', 'film', 'tough', 'nut', 'even', 'most', 'veteran', 'director', 'Knight', 'uncanny', 'confidence', 'only', 'second', 'feature', 'camera', 'Known', 'mainly', 'gritty', 'screenplays', 'such', 'Eastern', 'Promises', 'Dirty', 'Pretty', 'Things', 'Knight', 'precise', 'hand', 'ton', 'guts', 'guiding', 'movie', 'set', 'entirely', 'wheel', 'moving', 'vehicle', 'different', 'sort', 'role', 'Hardy', 'as', 'well', 'one', 'exacting', 'level', 'emotional', 'control', 'only', 'face', ""'re"", 'going', 'see', 'one', 'slip', 'up', 'whole', 'thing', 'could', 'go', 'astray.Hardy', 'Ivan', 'Locke', 'top', 'construction', 'expert', 'verge', 'biggest', 'concrete', 'pour', 'Europe', 'history', 'will', 'make', 'break', 'company', 'eve', 'take', 'place', 'BMW', 'skips', 'town', 'London', 'Understandably', 'out', 'colleagues', 'who', 'are', 'used', 'relying', 'typically', 'dependable', 'Locke', 'determined', 'get', 'somewhere', 'important', 'know', 'first', 'see', 'woman', 'voiced', 'Olivia', 'Colman', 'must', 'be', 'night', 'also', 'know', 'Locke', 'family', 'wife', 'Ruth', 'Wilson', 'who', 'waiting', 'home', 'two', 'boys', 'Tom', 'Holland', 'Bill', 'Milner', 'who', 'are', 'anxious', 'Dad', 'arrival', 'can', 'watch', 'big', 'soccer', 'match.But', 'Locke', ""n't"", 'coming', 'home', 'clear', 'man', 'who', 'good', 'decent', 'person', 'risking', 'everything', 'fix', 'major', 'screw-up', 'personal', 'professional', 'life', 'stake', 'mile', 'journey', 'Knight', 'who', 'also', 'penned', 'screenplay', 'up', 'tension', 'around', 'phone', 'call', 'Locke', 'may', 'not', 'sound', 'interesting', 'watch', 'Hardy', 'talk', 'car', 'phone', 'duration', 'Knight', 'smartly', 'out', 'just', 'enough', 'new', 'information', 'nothing', 'stays', 'dormant', 'long', 'What', 'obvious', 'Locke', 'man', 'who', 'always', 'prided', 'self-control', 'momentary', 'lapse', 'judgment', 'shaken', 'sense', 'self', '34', ""'ll"", 'fix', ""'ll"", 'go', 'back', 'normal', '34', 'certainty', 'borders', 'delusional', 'Locke', 'assuage', 'fears', 'nervous', 'assistant', 'who', 'must', 'now', 'handle', 'job', 'alone', 'must', 'also', 'calm', 'down', 'woman', 'racing', 'towards', 'trying', 'hold', 'family', 'together', 'less', 'said', 'exact', 'details', 'better', 'Knight', 'Hardy', 'guide', 'deliberately', 'Locke', 'soulful', 'journey', 'are', 'details', 'revealed', 'Locke', 'will', 'constantly', 'alter', 'perceptions', 'people', 'who', 'populate', 'life', 'atypical', 'actions', 'have', 'everyone', 'edge', 'bring', 'edge', 'seats', 'rare', 'Locke', 'vehicle', 'when', 'gorgeous', 'nocturnal', 'cinematography', 'only', 'mood', 'sinking', 'further', 'Locke', 'plight', 'amazing', 'how', 'much', 'one', 'can', 'learn', 'man', 'scant', '90', 'minutes', 'know', 'everything', 'Locke', 'time', 'movie', 'done', 'failings', 'strengths', 'laid', 'bare', 'see', 'judge', 'know', 'why', 'so', 'eager', 'make', 'hard', 'decisions', 'regardless', 'personal', 'cost', 'Where', 'story', 'skids', 'road', 'Locke', 'imagined', 'conversations', 'deadbeat', 'father', 'seem', 'overkill', 'making', 'point', 'Locke', 'character', 'Hardy', 'more', 'capable', 'getting', 'performance', 'here', 'understated', 'controlled', 'single', 'moment.Other', 'few', 'false', 'notes', 'Locke', 'impressively', 'bold', 'as', 'thrilling', 'resonant', 'nothing', 'else', 'daring', 'new', 'territory', 'Hardy', 'Knight', 'alike']",Locke Digital
