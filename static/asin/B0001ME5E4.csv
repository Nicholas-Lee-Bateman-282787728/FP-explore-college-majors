How did this film get cast?  I can't believe anybody got a role in this turkey as the result of an audition.  This cast (no way they can be called actors) must all be friends of the filmmaker.  There is not a single actor to be seen that is even halfway competent, and it is a fairly large cast.  I guess there is no shortage of talent-free wannabes. Especially laughable are the obviously gay non-actors attempting to portray heterosexuals, commenting on various women's physical endowments and discussing their past sexual conquests.  Now we're really in Fantasyland.The script is ludicrous; totally without coherence and the production is definitely bargain basement quality.  The picture and sound make it obvious that it was shot with a single video camera.How do films this bad ever get made?  It's a mystery.

But, I gave it a chance and I am glad that I did. The movie was actually quite entertaining, it didnt fully grab my attention until Joe made the mistake of thinking the frat guy was gay.  That scene when they were drinking beer at the house and he was like ""what makes you think Im gay..."" LMAO, I was hooked from then on. Look this movie is probably as low budget as it gets, and considering that fact, I gave it 5stars because it could have been a whole lot worse. It was a good story, kind of like a soap opera. The guy that likes to have sex with others guys has a girlfriend, but his younger brother is gay. So the younger brother hooks up with the guy the older brother was banging and then the older brother gets jealousy and wants his gay-bang buddy back. The guys are pretty cute too, so that has to count for something. I dont know who cast the actor that played Joe -he was good and all, but he looked kind of old to be going off to college for the first time. I was like damn, is going to be student or professor. I think what I liked most about this movie is what was going on between the lines.  Hello, Christian likes having sex with men. He is not into the girlfriend, so why are we walking away smiling at the end of the movie? I think we are going to need a sequal. I get it, the title is ""Issues101"" and Christian has Issues -I would say that is a bit over simplifying but ok its not my movie.All in all, I liked this movie very much. It was fun, it was sexy, it was entertaining and regardless of the bad acting, bad dialogue and bad music, it was a good storyline.

He quickly meets Christian, a friendly guy whom Joe assumes is coming on to him.  He's not, but ... let's just say that Christian has ""issues"" with his sexuality, which pretty much dictate most of the story.  Joe decides to pledge Christian's frat, Sigma Upsilon Kappa (or SUK for short - there's not much humor here, and what there is, certainly isn't subtle), which already has an openly gay brother and - obvious when you meet some of the others - more than its share of closet cases. Christian fixes up Joe with his gay (real, not frat) brother, and envies the rapport they quickly have with each other.  Joe decides to run for student body president (As a freshman there less than a month ... yeah. that's realistic!), but encounters some homophobia.  Ho-hum.""Issues 101"" is a 2002 indie film (actually, it's a video, and I'd rate the technical quality below average).  I don't knock the fact that it was likely shot on a tiny budget, but that the money wasn't spent wisely.  It has a title that makes it sound more like a documentary, a storyline that hangs on one guy's confusion about his sexuality, trite unrealistic dialogue, and perhaps the most annoying (and loud) soundtrack music I have ever encountered. In their promotional flyer, the producers push the fact that former American Idol winner Kelly Clarkson has a small cameo in the film.  The rest of the cast is quite forgettable, and Michael Rozman (as Joe, the main character) appears rather old to play a college freshman. Rear nudity, simulated sex would make for an R rating.  Except for an extra star allowed for some eye candy, this would likely have been a one star review.

810960,A342YAXL116N5A,B0001ME5E4,Dennis!,"[15, 17]","But I did just have to take some time to add to the chorus of how unspeakably bad this movie was.  I mean, it was absolutely awful.The first ten minutes of the film had me confused, because we see Joe (Michael Rozman) getting ready to go off to college... even he looks 35!  We know he's about to come out, but the friend to whom he comes out -- the one who comments that one of their high school pals has turned out to be a ""fruit"" -- comes across as pretty darn gay too, even though he claims to have a girlfriend.Then, Joe hits his new college and totally randomly meets Christian (Dennis Rittenhouse Jr.) playing volleyball.  Christian is overly friendly and invites Joe back to his house, supposedly to talk up his fraternity... and is shocked when Joe reveals that he thought it was a date.  Yeah, right.The movie then gets progressively bad from there, with Joe and Christian unknowingly getting filmed in the act of hooking up, then with Joe meeting and falling in love with Christian's younger brother, and no one seeming to bat an eye that Joe has now hooked up with both Christian and his younger brother (even though Joe clearly still primarily has feelings for Christian and would probably dump Michael in a heartbeat if Christian actually finally emerged from the closet.With one notable exception, the acting is horrific.  It seems like every single ""straight"" boy in this film is played by a gay guy, and poorly at that.  I keep reading things about how there's so few out gay actors in Hollywood films; perhaps this movie can give a small clue as to why: these gay guys can't play straight for the life of them.  Dennis Rittenhouse, Jr., as ""Straight with Issues"" Christian, sets off any decently tuned gaydar from the moment he appears on screen.  Gary Castro Churchill, who plays Bill, the fraternity president (whose sexuality is not really well disclosed in the film), is a terrible actor and also sends my gaydar into overdrive (and the spanking scene was further evidence of lame acting).  The worst of all: every single fraternity brother, including those who clamor for kicking the ""fag"" out of the fraternity after he's found out, are gayer than gay.  Despite the fact that they use the ""f-word"" and refer using vulgar terms to parts of female anatomy, those words compete with the handbags falling out of their mouths.The notable exception above: Jeff Sublett, who plays Michael, Christian's gay brother.  The only reason his acting stands out above the less-than-mediocre performances of his castmates is because, according to the DVD extras, he's played by a straight boy.  You know, I never would have guessed, which I guess means that his acting was at least that much better, because he played a gay kid really well.  Maybe his character was just very poorly written.  Well, it was... but I still hate to say he gave a great performance.  He gave a great performance only because he's straight, and I believed him as a gay guy.Oh, and let's not forget the decidedly amateur camera works.  I've seen low budget; I've even liked some low budget films.  This took it to a new level.  'Nuff said.The plot, to the extent there is one, is stale and cliched.  Joe falls for Christian -- even hooks up with him -- but Christian won't come out of the closet and thus Joe is left pining for him while he continues to play it straight with a girlfriend.  Meanwhile, Christian introduces Joe to Michael, his brother, and the two hit it off famously.  Christian, torn between at-least-kinda-sorta wanting to be with Joe and seeing his brother actually get him and be happy with him, wrestles with this odd balance.  And Michael can't understand why Joe (by now running for student body president) won't acknowledge their relationship in public.But other than the cute faces (though lacking in corresponding body heat) and some gratutious butt shots (though they did serve to give me something worth staying tuned for), this movie was a complete bust.",1,I hate to pile on....,1141430400,"03 4, 2006",2006,3969,"['did', 'just', 'have', 'take', 'time', 'add', 'chorus', 'how', 'unspeakably', 'bad', 'movie', 'was', 'mean', 'was', 'absolutely', 'awful.The', 'first', 'ten', 'minutes', 'film', 'had', 'confused', 'see', 'Joe', 'Michael', 'Rozman', 'getting', 'ready', 'go', 'off', 'college', 'even', '35', 'know', 'come', 'out', 'friend', 'whom', 'out', 'one', 'who', 'comments', 'one', 'high', 'school', 'pals', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'fruit', 'pretty', 'darn', 'gay', 'too', 'even', 'have', 'girlfriend.Then', 'Joe', 'new', 'college', 'totally', 'randomly', 'meets', 'Christian', 'Dennis', 'Rittenhouse', 'Jr.', 'playing', 'volleyball', 'Christian', 'overly', 'friendly', 'Joe', 'back', 'house', 'supposedly', 'talk', 'up', 'fraternity', 'shocked', 'when', 'Joe', 'thought', 'was', 'date', 'Yeah', 'right.The', 'movie', 'then', 'progressively', 'bad', 'Joe', 'Christian', 'unknowingly', 'getting', 'filmed', 'act', 'hooking', 'up', 'then', 'Joe', 'meeting', 'falling', 'love', 'Christian', 'younger', 'brother', 'one', 'seeming', 'bat', 'eye', 'Joe', 'now', 'hooked', 'up', 'Christian', 'younger', 'brother', 'even', 'Joe', 'clearly', 'still', 'primarily', 'feelings', 'Christian', 'would', 'probably', 'dump', 'Michael', 'heartbeat', 'Christian', 'actually', 'finally', 'emerged', 'closet.With', 'one', 'notable', 'exception', 'acting', 'horrific', 'single', 'straight', 'boy', 'film', 'played', 'gay', 'guy', 'poorly', 'keep', 'reading', 'things', 'how', 'so', 'few', 'out', 'gay', 'actors', 'Hollywood', 'films', 'perhaps', 'movie', 'can', 'give', 'small', 'clue', 'why', 'gay', 'guys', 'ca', ""n't"", 'play', 'straight', 'life', 'Dennis', 'Rittenhouse', 'Jr.', 'Straight', 'Issues', 'Christian', 'off', 'decently', 'tuned', 'gaydar', 'moment', 'screen', 'Gary', 'Castro', 'Churchill', 'who', 'Bill', 'fraternity', 'president', 'sexuality', 'not', 'really', 'well', 'disclosed', 'film', 'terrible', 'actor', 'also', 'gaydar', 'overdrive', 'spanking', 'scene', 'was', 'further', 'evidence', 'lame', 'acting', 'worst', 'single', 'fraternity', 'brother', 'including', 'who', 'clamor', 'kicking', 'fag', 'fraternity', 'found', 'are', 'gayer', 'gay', 'fact', 'use', 'f-word', 'refer', 'using', 'vulgar', 'terms', 'parts', 'female', 'anatomy', 'words', 'compete', 'handbags', 'falling', 'mouths.The', 'notable', 'exception', 'Jeff', 'Sublett', 'who', 'Michael', 'Christian', 'gay', 'brother', 'only', 'reason', 'acting', 'out', 'less-than-mediocre', 'performances', 'castmates', 'according', 'DVD', 'extras', 'played', 'straight', 'boy', 'know', 'never', 'would', 'have', 'guessed', 'guess', 'means', 'acting', 'was', 'least', 'much', 'better', 'played', 'gay', 'kid', 'really', 'well', 'Maybe', 'character', 'was', 'just', 'very', 'poorly', 'written', 'Well', 'was', 'still', 'hate', 'say', 'gave', 'great', 'performance', 'gave', 'great', 'performance', 'only', 'straight', 'believed', 'gay', 'guy.Oh', 'let', 'not', 'forget', 'decidedly', 'amateur', 'camera', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'low', 'budget', ""'ve"", 'even', 'liked', 'low', 'budget', 'films', 'took', 'new', 'level', 'said.The', 'plot', 'extent', 'one', 'stale', 'cliched', 'Joe', 'Christian', 'even', 'up', 'Christian', 'wo', ""n't"", 'come', 'closet', 'thus', 'Joe', 'left', 'pining', 'play', 'straight', 'girlfriend', 'Meanwhile', 'Christian', 'Joe', 'Michael', 'brother', 'two', 'hit', 'off', 'famously', 'Christian', 'torn', 'at-least-kinda-sorta', 'wanting', 'be', 'Joe', 'seeing', 'brother', 'actually', 'get', 'be', 'happy', 'odd', 'balance', 'Michael', 'ca', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'Joe', 'now', 'running', 'student', 'body', 'president', 'wo', ""n't"", 'acknowledge', 'relationship', 'public.But', 'other', 'cute', 'lacking', 'corresponding', 'body', 'heat', 'gratutious', 'butt', 'shots', 'did', 'serve', 'give', 'something', 'worth', 'staying', 'tuned', 'movie', 'was', 'complete', 'bust']",Issues 101

The only good thing about renting this crap is that we discovered one of the Brothers in my boyfriend's fraternity kept his participation in this movie a secret and now we can get on his case. Yup, unfortunately I know one of the actors playing a fraternity Brother in this so-called ""film.""Bad acting, bad directing, and terrible dialogue are just some of the things wrong with this disaster. Add to that a storyline that doesn't make sense (since when are half the guys in a fraternity gay and all the other brothers accepting of it, since when do guys in a frat makes the pledges go down on them in order to be initiated, since when does someone so easily get invited to pledge a frat after an accidental meeting at the beach seconds earlier?) and a slow, tedious pace and you have one of the worst films ever made. Plus, it's obvious all the actors are gay and either friends with the direcor or slept with him at one point, and none are convincing playing straight men.I don't know what the filmmakers were thinking. They had a decent $75,000 budget with which they could have at least made something even remotely worthwhile. This is just a step above a really bad porno.
