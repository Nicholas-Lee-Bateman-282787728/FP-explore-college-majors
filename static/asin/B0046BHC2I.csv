The first time I watched this movie, I liked it, but it was not one of my favorites. Later, I wanted to see the movie again, and the deeper things started to come out.In my mind, this movie is not about air drumming, it is more about the underdog overcoming. I found the characters to be all all bright and charming, and I liked the locations the film was made at.The extras include an interview with Neil Peart.At the end of the commentary Ari Gold asks to get in touch with him via his website. He does return your comments.",5,Underrated,1376179200,"08 11, 2013",2013,599,"['movie', 'best', 'appreciated', 'who', 'watch', 'movies', 'multiple', 'times', 'first', 'time', 'watched', 'movie', 'liked', 'was', 'not', 'one', 'favorites', 'Later', 'wanted', 'see', 'movie', 'again', 'deeper', 'things', 'started', 'come', 'out.In', 'mind', 'movie', 'not', 'air', 'drumming', 'more', 'underdog', 'overcoming', 'found', 'characters', 'be', 'bright', 'charming', 'liked', 'locations', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'at.The', 'extras', 'include', 'interview', 'Neil', 'Peart.At', 'end', 'commentary', 'Ari', 'Gold', 'get', 'touch', 'website', 'return', 'comments']",Adventures of Power

The humor here is a little more understated and probably won't appeal to some, but I thought it was an awesome comedy.  The Adventures of Power is finally something original with a fantastic soundtrack (if you love classic 80s rock such as Rush, Loverboy, or Mr. Mister), hilarious scenes reminiscent of Spinal Tap, and a good message about the underdog overcoming odds. There is also a love story, as Power meets Annie, a girl he falls for, who gives Power the inspiration to drum. The film is able to balance a bit of satire and wit with plain goofiness to create laughs.The Adventures of Power tells the story of one young man and his dream of air drumming. Power has always felt he had something special (even if it wasn't a set of drums), and while his uncle chastises him, telling him that people are making fun of him, Power still believes that good will come of his ""talent."" His air drumming skills take him to talent shows, to an illegal underground air drumming contest in Mexico, which features a motley mix of air drummers trying to keep up with speed metal, and finally to an all-stakes air drum showdown in Newark.  Carlos, a man without hands to drum, sees Power as the next great hope in air drumming, and enlists him. With his fascination with Rush's ""Tom Sawyer"", Power makes the trip to the big time with hopes of achieving great things. To do this, he and his fellow air drummers will have to battle the best of the best air drummers.Many have noted the similarities between The Adventures of Power with Napoleon Dynamite and Dodgeball. While it has a similar feel to these comedies, Power still does its own thing and has originality, which is seriously lacking in many comedies. Power has a bit of a flair for silliness, spoof and satire. Power is a breath of fresh air from the many gross out, high school, frat brother, mean-spirited, formulaic comedies recycled and thrown up onto the big screen.The extras are worthy of purchase as well. Included is a commentary and interview with Ari Gold, the star and producer as well as a drum off with Rush drummer, Neil Peart.The Adventures of Power is a hidden gem.",4,The best comedy about air drumming out there,1315958400,"09 14, 2011",2011,2302,"['Adventures', 'Power', 'received', 'plenty', 'hate', 'Netflix', 'Rottentomatoes', 'happen', 'think', 'film', 'was', 'pretty', 'clever', 'funny', 'silly', 'kind', 'way', 'humor', 'here', 'little', 'more', 'understated', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'appeal', 'thought', 'was', 'awesome', 'comedy', 'Adventures', 'Power', 'finally', 'something', 'original', 'fantastic', 'soundtrack', 'love', 'classic', '80s', 'rock', 'such', 'Rush', 'Loverboy', 'Mr.', 'Mister', 'hilarious', 'scenes', 'reminiscent', 'Spinal', 'Tap', 'good', 'message', 'underdog', 'overcoming', 'odds', 'also', 'love', 'story', 'Power', 'Annie', 'girl', 'who', 'Power', 'inspiration', 'drum', 'film', 'able', 'balance', 'bit', 'satire', 'wit', 'plain', 'goofiness', 'create', 'laughs.The', 'Adventures', 'Power', 'story', 'one', 'young', 'man', 'dream', 'air', 'drumming', 'Power', 'always', 'felt', 'had', 'something', 'special', 'even', 'was', ""n't"", 'set', 'drums', 'uncle', 'telling', 'people', 'are', 'making', 'fun', 'Power', 'still', 'good', 'will', 'come', 'talent', 'air', 'drumming', 'skills', 'take', 'talent', 'shows', 'illegal', 'underground', 'air', 'drumming', 'contest', 'Mexico', 'motley', 'mix', 'air', 'drummers', 'trying', 'keep', 'up', 'speed', 'metal', 'finally', 'all-stakes', 'air', 'showdown', 'Newark', 'Carlos', 'man', 'hands', 'drum', 'Power', 'next', 'great', 'hope', 'air', 'drumming', 'fascination', 'Rush', 'Tom', 'Sawyer', 'Power', 'trip', 'big', 'time', 'hopes', 'achieving', 'great', 'things', 'do', 'fellow', 'air', 'drummers', 'will', 'have', 'battle', 'best', 'best', 'air', 'drummers.Many', 'have', 'noted', 'similarities', 'Adventures', 'Power', 'Napoleon', 'Dynamite', 'Dodgeball', 'similar', 'feel', 'comedies', 'Power', 'still', 'own', 'thing', 'originality', 'seriously', 'lacking', 'many', 'comedies', 'Power', 'bit', 'flair', 'silliness', 'spoof', 'satire', 'Power', 'breath', 'fresh', 'air', 'many', 'gross', 'out', 'high', 'school', 'frat', 'brother', 'mean-spirited', 'formulaic', 'comedies', 'recycled', 'thrown', 'up', 'big', 'screen.The', 'extras', 'are', 'worthy', 'purchase', 'as', 'well', 'Included', 'commentary', 'interview', 'Ari', 'Gold', 'star', 'producer', 'as', 'well', 'drum', 'off', 'Rush', 'drummer', 'Neil', 'Peart.The', 'Adventures', 'Power', 'hidden', 'gem']",Adventures of Power
1387623,A1RDQWI6E5DHEI,B0046BHC2I,"Mark Vandergaard ""Looking at Roots""","[0, 0]","I met Ari Gold (writer, director, and lead star) of this hilarious look at the life of an air drummer. This is a terrific look at a subject that doesn't get nearly enough coverage in the entertainment industry, the &#34;air&#34; musicians of our day. It follows the life of an out of sync young man named Power who has trouble in his daily life working on an oil platform. The juxtapostion of political commentary of worker safety and the ability to unionize with the ridiculousness of Power's only talent of wanting to become the world's greatest air drummer is as hilarious as a movie can get. Great acting from Michael McKean as Power's father and Jane Lynch from the Christopher Guest movies. I was impressed by Ari's ability to get permission from all of the musicians and ASCAP to feature all of the songs in the film. Hilarious concept and execution by Ari and his crew.
