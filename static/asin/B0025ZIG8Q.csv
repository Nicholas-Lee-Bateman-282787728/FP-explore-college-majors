He starts out, due to his inability to doublethink, with thoughtcrime. This is in a society that believes a thought is as real as the deed. Eventually he graduates through a series of misdemeanors to illicit sex and even plans to overthrow the very government that took him in as an orphan.If he gets caught, he will be sent to the ""Ministry of Love"" where they have a record of 100% cures for this sort of insanity.  They will even forgive his past indiscretions.Peter Cushing, a veteran actor, plays Winston smith. The film is in black and white. There are clips of this film in other 1984 documentaries. Copies are hard to find. With any luck, this fill will show-up on a Criterion DVD.1984 ~ John Hurt",5,1984 (1954) TV,1247356800,"07 12, 2009",2009,968,"['Probably', 'one', 'best', 'renditions', 'story', 'based', 'book', '1984', 'written', 'George', 'Orwell.Basic', 'story', 'society', 'eliminated', 'many', 'imbalances', 'surplus', 'goods', 'even', 'class', 'struggle', 'are', 'bound', 'be', 'deviates', 'Winston', 'Smith', 'one', 'out', 'due', 'inability', 'doublethink', 'thoughtcrime', 'society', 'thought', 'as', 'real', 'deed', 'Eventually', 'series', 'misdemeanors', 'illicit', 'sex', 'even', 'plans', 'overthrow', 'very', 'government', 'took', 'orphan.If', 'caught', 'will', 'be', 'sent', 'Ministry', 'Love', 'where', 'have', 'record', '100', '%', 'cures', 'sort', 'insanity', 'will', 'even', 'forgive', 'past', 'indiscretions.Peter', 'Cushing', 'veteran', 'actor', 'Winston', 'smith', 'film', 'black', 'white', 'are', 'clips', 'film', 'other', '1984', 'documentaries', 'Copies', 'are', 'hard', 'find', 'luck', 'fill', 'will', 'show-up', 'Criterion', 'DVD.1984', '~', 'John', 'Hurt']",1984

It is also a great purchase for anyone who is supposed to read the book but would rather not spend the time to do that...George Orwells's masterpiece published in 1949 is the classic dystopian novel.  One seemingly insignificant man, Winston Smith, a civil servant assigned the task of perpetuating the regime's propaganda by falsifying records and political literature. Smith grows disillusioned with his meagre existence and so begins a rebellion against the system that leads to his arrest and torture.There seem to be several versions of this film available on DVD...Probably because it is available in the Public Domain.

If you compare the quality of this DVD-R with the one of the Adam Curtis Documentals, ""The Century of the Self"", this one is garbage. The latter has a beautiful presentation on the box and on the discs. I have just opened the box of this 1984 version and the image of the Dvd is fading in my hands. As one of the other reviewers said: ""the image quality of the movie is the same as youtube"". Maybe this Company is making the transfer from youtube version to DVD (it looks awfull). If this Dvd is remastered I'm The Big Brother. I know it is an excellent movie, but I have paid $25.49 for this terrible DVD transfer.
