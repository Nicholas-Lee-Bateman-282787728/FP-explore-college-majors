1297121,AQZH7YTWQPOBE,B002WNU0QM,Enjolras,"[37, 37]","I haven't been crazy about the past ""Prince and Me"" movies, partly because the acting was weak and they had corny plotlines. I particularly was disappointed withPrince and Me 3: A Royal Honeymoon, so I wasn't sure what to expect with the fourth installment in the series.Fortunately,Prince & Me 4: Elephant Adventureis far superior to its predecessors. I don't what changed - the director and main actors are all the same - but it's an almost entirely different film. InPrince & Me 4: Elephant Adventure, Edvard, Paige, and Soren go to the Kingdom of Sangyoon to attend a royal wedding. However, en route, they uncover a love affair, lose an elephant, and save a hill tribe. The plot was both action-packed and emotionally engaging - something to satisfy the boys and girls.Chris Gere (King Edvard) and Kam Heskin (Queen Paige) will never be my favorite actors, but they seem to have really found themselves in this movie. They're funny, energetic, and confident. Ben Miller as Soren has also morphed from a boring government advisor to a comedic sidekick. He easily had some of the best lines in the movie. The new Asian characters, from Princess Myra to the combative Rayen, are also lively and add to the movie.ThePrince & Me 4: Elephant Adventure's production quality is also a lot better. There's no cheap ski cabins and grainy shots of animals as inPrince and Me 3: A Royal Honeymoon. For the scenes in Sangyoon (which is loosely based on Burma, but mixes several Southeast Asian cultures), the cast and crew actually went to Thailand. The sets for the palace buildings are impressive, considering that they were probably built from scratch. Best of all were the jungle scenes, filmed in rainforests. The movie also has a lot of animals, including elephants and orangutans.*Even if you were disappointed with the past ""Prince & Me"" movies, I do suggest you give this one a try. It makes the previous ""Prince & Me"" movies look amateurish. Highly recommended for families and couples who want to watch a romantic comedy, mixed with a bit of adventure.* There is a brief scene in the movie when Paige rides an elephant. I wanted to make sure viewers are aware that elephants often go through horrible rituals in order to domesticate them. Therefore, if you go to Asia, you should avoid riding elephants and not support such practices. However, despite the DVD box cover, the elephant-riding scene inPrince & Me 4: Elephant Adventureis short - only a few seconds - so I guess the movie directors realized they shouldn't try to promote elephant-riding.",5,A big improvement over the last ones,1269388800,"03 24, 2010",2010,2553,"['have', ""n't"", 'been', 'crazy', 'past', 'Prince', 'Me', 'movies', 'partly', 'acting', 'was', 'weak', 'had', 'corny', 'plotlines', 'particularly', 'was', 'disappointed', 'withPrince', 'Me', '3', 'Royal', 'Honeymoon', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'what', 'expect', 'fourth', 'installment', 'series.Fortunately', 'Prince', 'Me', '4', 'Elephant', 'Adventureis', 'far', 'predecessors', 'do', ""n't"", 'what', 'changed', 'director', 'main', 'actors', 'are', 'same', 'almost', 'entirely', 'different', 'film', 'InPrince', 'Me', '4', 'Elephant', 'Adventure', 'Edvard', 'Paige', 'Soren', 'go', 'Kingdom', 'Sangyoon', 'attend', 'royal', 'wedding', 'However', 'route', 'uncover', 'love', 'affair', 'lose', 'elephant', 'save', 'hill', 'tribe', 'plot', 'was', 'action-packed', 'emotionally', 'engaging', 'something', 'satisfy', 'boys', 'girls.Chris', 'Gere', 'King', 'Edvard', 'Kam', 'Heskin', 'Queen', 'Paige', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'favorite', 'actors', 'seem', 'have', 'really', 'found', 'movie', ""'re"", 'funny', 'energetic', 'confident', 'Ben', 'Miller', 'Soren', 'also', 'morphed', 'boring', 'government', 'advisor', 'comedic', 'sidekick', 'easily', 'had', 'best', 'lines', 'movie', 'new', 'Asian', 'characters', 'Princess', 'Myra', 'combative', 'Rayen', 'are', 'also', 'lively', 'add', 'movie.ThePrince', 'Me', '4', 'Elephant', 'Adventure', 'production', 'quality', 'also', 'lot', 'better', 'cheap', 'ski', 'cabins', 'grainy', 'shots', 'animals', 'inPrince', 'Me', '3', 'Royal', 'Honeymoon', 'scenes', 'Sangyoon', 'loosely', 'based', 'Burma', 'mixes', 'several', 'Southeast', 'Asian', 'cultures', 'cast', 'crew', 'actually', 'went', 'Thailand', 'sets', 'palace', 'buildings', 'are', 'impressive', 'considering', 'were', 'probably', 'built', 'scratch', 'Best', 'were', 'jungle', 'scenes', 'filmed', 'rainforests', 'movie', 'also', 'lot', 'animals', 'including', 'elephants', 'orangutans', '*Even', 'were', 'disappointed', 'past', 'Prince', 'Me', 'movies', 'do', 'suggest', 'give', 'one', 'try', 'previous', 'Prince', 'Me', 'movies', 'look', 'amateurish', 'Highly', 'recommended', 'families', 'couples', 'who', 'want', 'watch', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'mixed', 'bit', 'adventure', '*', 'brief', 'scene', 'movie', 'when', 'Paige', 'elephant', 'wanted', 'make', 'sure', 'viewers', 'are', 'aware', 'elephants', 'often', 'go', 'horrible', 'rituals', 'order', 'domesticate', 'Therefore', 'go', 'Asia', 'should', 'avoid', 'riding', 'elephants', 'not', 'support', 'such', 'practices', 'However', 'DVD', 'box', 'cover', 'elephant-riding', 'scene', 'inPrince', 'Me', '4', 'Elephant', 'Adventureis', 'short', 'only', 'few', 'seconds', 'so', 'guess', 'movie', 'directors', 'realized', 'should', ""n't"", 'try', 'promote', 'elephant-riding']",The Prince & Me: The Elephant Adventure

Noted, the last two installments were a tad lame; the first movie is the best, but this one is second, and much more entertaining.  It's still lightweight fare and dialogue, by in large, but there's more adventure and thrills here, but still with the emphasis on the love affair between the two main characters.By invitation to a wedding, the Danish royal couple zoom off to jungles and elephants and discover a princess not so willing to marry and in love with a poor commoner. Paige to the rescue as she urges Eddy to intervene.  There's intrigue and a trek through the rainforest on an elephant search while being chased by soldiers.They put money into the sets and outdoor shots.  Our little girls(3&6) think Paige(Kam Heskin) is Barbie on an adventure, and like her many different and beautiful outfits and of course, the elephants.Also, we kept them from watching the more scary parts, e.g., when the heroes get captured by men waving guns who then tie up and gagged them- more appropriate for pre-adolescent and older.  But overall, it's still very tame: no cussing, nudity, sex- lots of pecks by King and Queen to show their undying love.If you never cared for any part of this series, you'll still find this one boring, but prettier.

Its the one year anniversery for Paige Morgan and Prince Edward and they find themselves spending it in their own Jungle book type adventure.  Something you mind think to find in Indiana Jones films. Paige is now balancing her time as Queen with that of her work as a doctor. That doesn't stop both them from a anniversery trip to Asia even though they each have their own reasons for the trip.  For Edward its to convince the King to accept Denmark's aid while for the queen it to bring her doctor skills to the needed.

The princess' wicked fiance who believe the common people are slime to make the royals more rich doesn't plan to let his plans ruin and frame the stable boy to get him out of the way. The question of loyalty is brought up as the king's army is sent out by the fiance to stop Edward and Paige from returning the missing elephant and freeing the boy and prevent a enviromental disaster.
