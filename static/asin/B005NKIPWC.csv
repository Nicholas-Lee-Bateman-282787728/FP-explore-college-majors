Makes you wonder if there are any non Russian spies working for the CIA and FBI for it is stranger how these two guys were vetted for their jobs. Also the idea that know terrorists and spies are here in the US is less likely for us to believe these days. How they get in unnoticed is not all that likely anymore. Possible, yes, but not likely. We have to worry more about home grown terrorists such as those involved in the Boston marathon bombings than people sneaking in.

I cant really tell you why I didnt like it without giving away spoilers so I wont.  Basically it never tells you WHY certain people are being sought after and killed.  It doesn't develop the characters properly and is just sloppy at times.  The acting isnt Awesome and Richard Gere is kind of statue like at times.  I dont understand the hype of this movie.Wouldnt watch again unless I had to.",1,Plot lacks Meat 'n Potatoes,1391558400,"02 5, 2014",2014,463,"['think', 'movie', 'good', 'idea', 'beginning', 'too', 'fast', 'cant', 'really', 'tell', 'why', 'didnt', 'giving', 'away', 'spoilers', 'so', 'wont', 'Basically', 'never', 'WHY', 'certain', 'people', 'are', 'being', 'sought', 'killed', ""n't"", 'develop', 'characters', 'properly', 'just', 'sloppy', 'times', 'acting', 'isnt', 'Awesome', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'kind', 'statue', 'times', 'dont', 'understand', 'hype', 'movie.Wouldnt', 'watch', 'again', 'had']",The Double

The characters are likable, making it hard to know who you are (or should be) rooting for sometimes.  Expect to be surprised, especially if you are not a hardcore mystery fan.Thoroughly enjoyable.  Buy it or watch it.  You cannot go wrong with this movie.",4,Great Spy Movie!,1393286400,"02 25, 2014",2014,364,"['Well-written', 'Superbly', 'acted', 'spy', 'movie', 'watching', 'twists', 'tension', 'mystery', 'characters', 'are', 'likable', 'making', 'hard', 'know', 'who', 'are', 'should', 'be', 'rooting', 'sometimes', 'Expect', 'be', 'surprised', 'especially', 'are', 'not', 'hardcore', 'mystery', 'fan.Thoroughly', 'enjoyable', 'Buy', 'watch', 'can', 'not', 'go', 'wrong', 'movie']",The Double
