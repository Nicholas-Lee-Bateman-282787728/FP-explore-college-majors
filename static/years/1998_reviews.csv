And, at that time, there was a great actor who played James Bond, a no-name  guy who'll become Sean Connery. There was no need, then, of endless  explosions or multiple gunfights to please the audience. DR NO is terrific,  fast and should be showed to all these new directors who believe that they  have to destroy seventy cars while filming a car chase.  In one word, this  movie is refreshing. A DVD for Sean and Ursula fans.",Dr. No VHS Tape
241913,"This film is one of my all-time favorite comedies. If you want a great laugh, this is the movie to watch some night, with the comic geniuses Steve Martin and the late John Candy.  The only reason why it is rated R is for  one scene of the f word repeated about seven times (which is kind of funny)  but that is about it.  If you fast forward that part, this is a classic  comedy for the whole family.","Planes, Trains And Automobiles VHS"
275114,"It's the 1920s in a big, corrupt city controlled by gangsters. Violence, stupidity, backstabbing and greed are everywhere. There are beatings, shootings, burnings, and broken glass. It's always dark, even during the  day. Anyone who doesn't end up dead ends up unhappy.",Miller's Crossing VHS
141100,"Sure, you wouldn't expect it from a film like this, but it gives you a thing or two to think about.  Voight, as always, is excellent as a hardened lifer who never deludes himself as to exactly how bad people can be  (himself, the warden, and the rest of us), with a surprisingly good turn by  both Roberts and DeMornay.  Philosophical insights pop up at the oddest  moments, but it never sounds trite or artificial.  Good, solid film.",N/A
165306,"I'm not really too hot about Tom Cruise, but this film changed all my opinions about him. I think this and Rainman are his best works by far. Jerry Maguire (Cruise) is a top sports agent but when he does a memo  stating his firm should be more human, he gets the sack. He leaves taking  the goldfish, his one client Rod Tidwell (An excellent Cuba Gooding Jr) and  one of the accountants Dorothy a single mum (Renee Zellweger) This film is  suberb and really deals with people's emotions. Tom Cruise is exceelent as  the confused Jerry Maguire. Cuba Gooding Jr is both funny and sweet as Rod  Tidwell and got a well deserved best supporting actor oscar (Show me the  money!) Renee Zellweger is very god as Dorothy who is hoplessly devoted to  Jerry. All in all this a good, fun film to watch and I must admit I had a  tear in my eye at the end, and the 2 little boys in it are really cute.",Jerry Maguire
349638,This is a great story and it is also the story that introduces Davros as  the creator of the Daleks. I always get a kick out of Davros because he  looks like a child running around in a walker only not nearly as cute.  Harry Sullivan and Sarah Jane Smith are the Doctors companions in these  stories. You will enjoy!  END,Doctor Who - The Sontaran Experiment/The Genesis of the Daleks VHS
281735,"Kurt Thomas, Olympic gymnast, stars in an action packed thrill ride that all must see to believe.  Kurt Thomas battles black-hooded evil-doers in a barbaric bloodsport.  The film comes to a climax in the village of the  insane, where oddly enough, one finds a stone pommel horse in the town  square. In a dramatic scene, he fends off the insane villagers with the  now-famous Thomas twist on the pommel horse.  In a satisfying ending, Kurt  wins the princess and secures important land rights for the United States  government.  For $68, what a bargain!  Order it now!",Gymkata VHS
365091,"Dietrich plays a sophisticated jewel thief who steals a valuable string of pearls from a Parisian jeweler.  While fleeing the city, her car breaks down.  In comes Gary Cooper, an American on vacation, to save the day.  She  ditches him and goes on her merry way to meet up with her accomplices in  the next town, where she again runs into Cooper.  Naturally, they fall in  love.  This is just an all around fun movie to watch, one that can be seen  over and over again.  This is the second film Dietrich and Cooper made  together, the first being &quot;Morocco&quot;. Their chemistry is superb.  Dietrich was given one song to sing in the film, &quot;Awake in a  Dream&quot;, which she performed while playing a piano.  This is definately  one of this reviewers favorite Dietrich films.  A must see for anyone!",N/A
