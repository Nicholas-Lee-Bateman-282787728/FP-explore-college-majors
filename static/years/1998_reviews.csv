And, at that time, there was a great actor who played James Bond, a no-name  guy who'll become Sean Connery. There was no need, then, of endless  explosions or multiple gunfights to please the audience. DR NO is terrific,  fast and should be showed to all these new directors who believe that they  have to destroy seventy cars while filming a car chase.  In one word, this  movie is refreshing. A DVD for Sean and Ursula fans.",Dr. No VHS Tape
241913,"This film is one of my all-time favorite comedies. If you want a great laugh, this is the movie to watch some night, with the comic geniuses Steve Martin and the late John Candy.  The only reason why it is rated R is for  one scene of the f word repeated about seven times (which is kind of funny)  but that is about it.  If you fast forward that part, this is a classic  comedy for the whole family.","Planes, Trains And Automobiles VHS"
275114,"It's the 1920s in a big, corrupt city controlled by gangsters. Violence, stupidity, backstabbing and greed are everywhere. There are beatings, shootings, burnings, and broken glass. It's always dark, even during the  day. Anyone who doesn't end up dead ends up unhappy.",Miller's Crossing VHS
141100,"Sure, you wouldn't expect it from a film like this, but it gives you a thing or two to think about.  Voight, as always, is excellent as a hardened lifer who never deludes himself as to exactly how bad people can be  (himself, the warden, and the rest of us), with a surprisingly good turn by  both Roberts and DeMornay.  Philosophical insights pop up at the oddest  moments, but it never sounds trite or artificial.  Good, solid film.",N/A
165306,"I'm not really too hot about Tom Cruise, but this film changed all my opinions about him. I think this and Rainman are his best works by far. Jerry Maguire (Cruise) is a top sports agent but when he does a memo  stating his firm should be more human, he gets the sack. He leaves taking  the goldfish, his one client Rod Tidwell (An excellent Cuba Gooding Jr) and  one of the accountants Dorothy a single mum (Renee Zellweger) This film is  suberb and really deals with people's emotions. Tom Cruise is exceelent as  the confused Jerry Maguire. Cuba Gooding Jr is both funny and sweet as Rod  Tidwell and got a well deserved best supporting actor oscar (Show me the  money!) Renee Zellweger is very god as Dorothy who is hoplessly devoted to  Jerry. All in all this a good, fun film to watch and I must admit I had a  tear in my eye at the end, and the 2 little boys in it are really cute.",Jerry Maguire
349638,This is a great story and it is also the story that introduces Davros as  the creator of the Daleks. I always get a kick out of Davros because he  looks like a child running around in a walker only not nearly as cute.  Harry Sullivan and Sarah Jane Smith are the Doctors companions in these  stories. You will enjoy!  END,Doctor Who - The Sontaran Experiment/The Genesis of the Daleks VHS
281735,"Kurt Thomas, Olympic gymnast, stars in an action packed thrill ride that all must see to believe.  Kurt Thomas battles black-hooded evil-doers in a barbaric bloodsport.  The film comes to a climax in the village of the  insane, where oddly enough, one finds a stone pommel horse in the town  square. In a dramatic scene, he fends off the insane villagers with the  now-famous Thomas twist on the pommel horse.  In a satisfying ending, Kurt  wins the princess and secures important land rights for the United States  government.  For $68, what a bargain!  Order it now!",Gymkata VHS
365091,"Dietrich plays a sophisticated jewel thief who steals a valuable string of pearls from a Parisian jeweler.  While fleeing the city, her car breaks down.  In comes Gary Cooper, an American on vacation, to save the day.  She  ditches him and goes on her merry way to meet up with her accomplices in  the next town, where she again runs into Cooper.  Naturally, they fall in  love.  This is just an all around fun movie to watch, one that can be seen  over and over again.  This is the second film Dietrich and Cooper made  together, the first being &quot;Morocco&quot;. Their chemistry is superb.  Dietrich was given one song to sing in the film, &quot;Awake in a  Dream&quot;, which she performed while playing a piano.  This is definately  one of this reviewers favorite Dietrich films.  A must see for anyone!",N/A
67348,This is nothing more than a 2 1/2 hour long promotional video featuring lip syncing and horrible video directing. It's just plain bad. It is not even shot in front of a live audience! You cannot take this masterfull work  and place it in a vacuum and expect a theatrical piece to emerge. Too bad  this version will outlive all stage versions for future generations to see.  But why am I complaining- your whole family can kill a Friday night for  less than $20- if you want to see a world class musical you'll have to  travel to New York or London and drop at least $60 a ticket.,N/A
377170,"Wings of Honneamise is the first theater version animation of GAINAX , which later creates Neon Genesis Evangelion. It was released in 1984 in Japan, directed by Hiroyuki Yamaga at that time age of 24. Even though it gained little success on busines base at that time, even today, well loved and supported.  The stage is some other world, where no one still go outer space. In a poor and old-fashioned country, Royal Space Force is established to send man to outer space. Shiro, an lazy official there, inspired by a religious girl, volunteers to be the first man in space. After fighting all the political and international conspiracy, he goes outer space and sends profound message to people on earth.  END",Wings of Honneamise VHS
184077,"I have studied the history of and legends surrounding the sinking of the Titanic for over 20 years, and I have not seen a finer, more comprehensive treatment of the disaster.  Not only are there survivors accounts featured  (several of whom have since died), but interviews with Walter Lord and  other historians.  This is, in short, what a Titanic documentary would look  like if Ken Burns decided to do one.  Kudos!  Outstanding!",Titanic A&E Documentary  VHS
319984,"What could possibly out do the sheer drama of the greatest crisis this country ever faced?  Gettysburg is an excellent film, magnificent in scope, filled with truly great performances (did you ever see Jeff Daniels any  better than this?).  Just a few flaws: the battles scenes were quite good,  but I've seen better, and the film occasionally takes its own historical  importance too seriously.  Still, a good film, and I can't complain too  much, I own a copy.  Look fast during Picket's Charge to see Ted Turner as  a Condeferate and Ken Burns as a Yankee.",Gettysburg VHS
429206,"I was amazed when I read that this British production was not well  received upon its release in 1992.  The highly talented pair of Juliette  Binoche and Ralph Fiennes play the doomed Cathy and Heathcliff, supported  by the equally fine Janet McTeer as Ellen Dean.  The performances are  exemplary--Fiennes' performance is said to have inspired Steven Spielberg  to cast him as the Nazi commandant in &quot;Schindler's List.&quot;  And a  diabolical Heathcliff he is, indeed--Fiennes plays this intense role  faithful to Emily Bronte's original character.  He is tormented, sadistic,  manipulative, ruthless and brutal--and nonetheless hypnotically sexual and  alluring.  This is the genuine Heathcliff, with all apologies to the  brilliant Laurence Olivier, who portrayed Heathcliff as a much more  sympathetic character. Juliette Binoche plays both Cathy and Cathy's  daughter by the ineffectual Edgar Linton, and brings great depth and appeal  to both roles. The scenes of the bleak Yorkshire moors, and the haunting,  shadowy quality of the Wuthering Heights house, lend this film a truly  Gothic atmosphere. A jarring note is the casting of Sinead O'Connor (in a  wig) as Emily Bronte, but this is a minor flaw. I found this version every  bit as good as the original 1939 classic, to which this film has been  unfairly compared.  It is much more faithful to the brooding, doomed  quality of the book.  The scenes acted by Fiennes as the grief-stricken  Heathcliff just after Cathy's death are alone worth the price of the film.  For the many fans of these two brilliant actors, and of Bronte's novel,  this film is well worth seeing.  END",Wuthering Heights VHS
332383,"I love this movie, and I love the fact that I can't really explain why I love it.  Without a doubt the most visceral, thought-provoking, consciousness-expanding narrative ever committed to film. I teach  eleventh-grade English, and I show this movie ostensibly to teach the  students about theme and ambiguity, but really I just want to make sure  they don't enter adulthood without sitting through it at least once...and  it is so satisfying to see them won over by a movie with practically no  dialogue, no big action scenes, and no satisfying closure.  This movie  frustrates your expectations at every turn, and by doing so gives you the  viewing experience of a lifetime.",N/A

Forget Tony Robbins for your daily dose of anti  depressant motivation, if you are not laughing hysterically after watching  CLEESE, Robbins has no hope. Recomended without any hesitation.A BRILLIANT  COMEDY MASTERPIECE.",N/A
366390,"Director Jacques Tourneur has crafted asuperior chiller- intelligent and intensely atmospheric. The story of a skeptical scientist confronting demonicforces is tightly written and fast paced. Above par acting,  excellent black and white photography and a great scorecombine to make  &quot;Curse of the Demon&quot; one of the very few supernatural films that  can be taken seriously. A well made and intelligent film by any standard.",Curse of the Demon VHS
448830,"THE GINGERBREAD MAN is a very good movie, one of the best of Robert Altman's fluctuent career. The big question was : How an independent filmmaker such as Altman would cope with a John Grisham script ? No problem  at all, in fact. I don't know from which one came the idea to create a  fairy tale world around a southern lawyer story, but it was a great idea.  So we have a lawyer which drives a red car and goes by night in a forest to  find a very mean ogre who doesn't wear shoes. Doesn't this story remind you  something ? You can have fun to count how many tales's plots Altman and  Grisham have used in this story. Believe me or not, there are a lot of  them. A DVD for the child in you.",N/A

320678,"Though it's not really fitting for a movie in the Alien series, Alien3 is  an interestingly done if monochrome-looking exercise in religious allegory.  Weaver handles the constantly changing role of Ripley well, combining both  the independence shown in Alien with the maternal aspects of Aliens.  This,  combined with the rest of the cast and some effective camerawork, makes for  what is at least an interesting film.  It must be seen letterboxed for it  to make any sense, however.  The end of the movie (and what should have  been the end of the series) is amazing, of course, and worth waiting for  even if you find the preceding two hours unbearably dull.  Give the film a  second look (or a first!), but again, in its original Panavision format if  possible; otherwise it becomes very visually garbled.  END",N/A
291586,"One of the best westerns ever made, RIDE THE HIGH COUNTRY comes as a surprise to anyone who believes that Sam Peckinpah could only produce blood and gore in his films.  Delicate, literate, and moving, RIDE THE HIGH  COUNTRY effectively blends adventure, excitement, and morality,  particularly through the central character, Steve Judd (who is  representational of Peckinpah's father).  Biblical references and metaphors  abound, pulling the viewer into the actions and dilemmas of the main  characters.  Peckinpah's debut feature film, RIDE THE HIGH COUNTRY  introduces several actors who became part of the Peckinpah Road Company: R.  G. Armstrong, John Davis Chandler, L. Q Jones, and (best of all) Warren  Oates.  These actors would appear in numerous Peckinpah films.  RIDE THE  HIGH COUNTRY is a must see.  No one to whom I have recommended it has ever  been disappointed in it.  It should be on every collectors shelf.",Ride the High Country VHS

Excellent!The story is about a Sorority Prank that is being done to the new inductees (Bauer and Stevens).During  this prank, they enter a bowling alley when a demonic imp starts creating a  lot of problems for our lovely sorority sisters.It leaves a funny movie  with lots of scantily clad sisters.",N/A
291236,"This Panavision and color adaptation of Tennessee Williams' most poetic play is a showcase for both his words and Geraldine Page's Oscar-nominated performance.  Spirituality vs. carnality is the theme of a spinster  romantically attracted to her childhood neighbor, a wild libertine.  Elmer  Bernstein's score is magnificant - one of his finest and one of the finest  in film history. Listen during Alma's soul-searing final monologue using  images of ice and fire and listen to Bernstein's use of harp glissandos  that reflect the words.  This is Page's finest screen performance and along  with the score and the writing are the main reasons for viewing.  The  prologue and main title are letterboxed - showing the fine use of wide  screen.  Nominations were also received for Una Merkel's supporting  performance as the dotty mother, Bernstein's score and the period Art  Direction.  Well worth a visit.",Summer & Smoke VHS
141073,"We all know that Akira Kurosawa is one of the 20th century's consummate directors.  His interpretations of &quot;Macbeth&quot; (&quot;Throne of Blood&quot;) and &quot;King Lear&quot; (&quot;Ran&quot;) have made these  400-year-old dramas real for two generations (so far) who would have  probably otherwise never been exposed to them.  But it is as the  screenwriter of &quot;Runaway Train&quot; that he has spoken most  personally to me.  The Mannheim/Rainkin character (singular!) is commonly  described as &quot;existential,&quot; but that is a Western conceit; in  fact, Kurosawa has gone to the very core of Taoist philosophy in this film.  Simply awesome.",N/A
72614,"This movie was very good. Though the story was a bit lame...the usual &quot;human kind is gonna die, someone needs to save it&quot;, the action was fast paced and very fullfilling. The main character, the terminator, needed no special acting skills other than one expresion (good thing for Arnold). Just one thing...its one of those paradox things...If they prevented the future from happening the way they did, then  how did the terminator come back in time if they never exsisting?  The DVD format did the movie justice. It brought out the color and effects the VHS version could not. The sounds and explotions were mush more well defined also.  END",N/A
