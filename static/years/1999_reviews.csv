364313,"I first saw this glittering fantasy tale on the silver screen with my family when I was a young teenager. I truly love the mystic world full of such whimsical creatures such as multi-faced courtiers, a gigantic swamp  tortoise, a rock-eating giant, an eldery elfin couple, and so on forth.  Especially the flying white dragon that greatly resembles a big, friendly  puppy dog! In this film, a brave young boy being chased by school bullies  and having to put up with an indifferent dad secretly smuggles a  unusual-looking book out of an musty old bookstore. Then he hides in a  school closet to read all about &quot;himself&quot; as the hero setting out  on a great quest to save the dying world from the unseen evil. Imagine a  young child becoming quite enthralled by a real storybook, especially the  part where he cries over the death of the hero's horse deep in the depths  of a treacherous swampland. And there are also frightening parts  in this  imaginative yarn as well, yet it is still quite a welcome change for young  people being raised in the age of really gross and scary movies like  &quot;The Gremlins&quot; and &quot;The Blade Runner&quot;. However, the sad  thing about &quot;The Neverending Story&quot; is that it is eventually  reduced to direct-to-video kiddie fodder those days.",The NeverEnding Story VHS
81609,"From the day he was born, Simon Birch was different. No bigger than a baby bird, doctors predicted he would never last the night. But he did. Then they said he would never last a week. But he did. Eventually, Simon grew into a little boy, fortified by the staunch belief that God had made him small for a reason, that God not only had a special plan for him but that he was going to be a hero. His story is related by a narrator, Simon's best friend as a child, now grown-up. We only see him twice - at the beginning and at the end - but it's this character, played with incredibly sensitivity by Jim Carrey (who curiously gets no screen credit) that bookends the narrative. Veteran screenwriter and now first-time director Mark Steven Johnson has created a cinematic fable, suggested by John Irving's ""A Prayer for Owen Meany."" Since the story begins in a graveyard in Gravestown, Maine, by the tombstone of ""Simon Birch,"" we know that the pivotal character died at the age of 12, so the only dramatic tension revolves around when, where, and how this tragedy occurred. The problem with the structure of the film is that it's so obviously melodramatic and manipulative. In the title role, Ian Michael Smith, who is afflicted with a rare enzyme disorder, Morquio Syndrome, compensates for his ""vertical challenge"" with a truly magical display of talent. And Joseph Mazzello delivers a truly remarkable performance as Simon's best friend (the young Jim Carrey) whose single mother, played by Ashley Judd, refuses to reveal the name of his father, thus providing the curious boys with an ongoing mystery. Oliver Platt and David Straithairn provide stalwart support",N/A
258376,"I first saw ""The Day After"" in its entirety in 1989. The film is a ""horror"" story about nuclear war, which concentrates on areas around Kansas City. Jason Robards plays a doctor. He is one of the survivors who makes his way back to the hospital, which is being swamped with the injured and the sick.The scenes of the holocaust are quite spectacular (for their time) and this is the highlight of the film. After that the film seems to drag. Survivors wandering around hopelessly, getting sick and dying. I know this is what would happen in reality but I don't think the film needed to go on for as long as it did. It managed to be a disturbing story until I saw the British film ""Threads"", which was far more realistic and far less sentimental.When you analyze ""The Day After"" you start to wonder how realistic it really is. If nuclear war really happened, it's highly unlikely that a hospital would be able to help anyone. (That was put across quite graphically in ""Threads"".) Is a car really a safe place to hide from a nuclear explosion? If my memory serves me correctly, Jason Robards wasn't even scratched! All the other people around him were dead.If you want to see the ""real"" consequences of nuclear war, see ""Threads"". (If you can find it.) It was directed by Mick Jackson, better known for his film ""Volcano"".",N/A

It is the funniest, wackiest Muppet movie since The Great Muppet Caper.Knowing parodies of ID4, Close Encounters of the Third Kind and The  X-Files added extra chuckles.The only flaw is that they don't sing their  own songs like they did in previous movies, but you can't have everything.  If you are a Muppet fan, you will enjoy this movie (unless you are  expecting a feature length version of Pigs in Space).",N/A
469497,"It's amazing how BWP has actually split people evenly into the pro/&quot;I love it&quot; to the con/&quot;What the hell is this?&quot; crowds.  I for one loved this film for it's &quot;chill&quot; factor.  I've been watching horror films (Hammer, etc.) and reading horror books and comics (King,  Barker, etc) since I can remember, and I still think that BWP is by far the  scariest piece of fiction ever made largely due to it's realism and the way  it prompts viewers to &quot;visualize&quot; the implied terror in Heather  and crew's film.For maximum effect (especially for those who  &quot;just didn't get it&quot; including a number of my friends with whom I  have been heartily debating this for quite some time now), I'd suggest  buying this DVD (it's really worth it especially given the fact that it's  loaded with special features such as the  fake documentary et al coupled  with its low price relative to higher priced DVDs whose only so-called  special features are interactive menus - as  well as one or two theatrical trailers) and watching  &quot;Curse of the Blair Witch&quot; first before viewing the feature film.  Then, as a recap, try getting a copy of the BWP Dossier which more or less  goes a step further in providing an epilogue of sorts to the film with a  post-investigation &quot;seance&quot; of sorts conducted by Buck Buchanan  and party at the site (Rustin Parr's house), with spine-tingling results!  At best, you'd really, really get scared and at worst, you'd probably find  the whole thing still unintelligible but still you can't deny and keep from  being impressed at the overall effort and creativity exhibited by the maker  of BWP in propagating the whole mythology.",Curse of the Blair Witch VHS

That's why when you come across a REALLY funny movie....you  must TELL PEOPLE!  If you like witty, realistic, sarcastic dialogue  delivered by a perfact cast this is the movie to buy.

507882,"It's an interesting exercise in documentary film-making, but the sources are so dubious, you have to question Broomfield's judgment in relying solely on them. The film is missing something -- it never ties it all  together or pushes its points through to their conclusions.Tom Grant's  conspiracy theory is refuted only from one angle, but never fully explored.  Broomfield seemed to have worked hard to get the film made, but doesn't  seem to have done enough actual reporting. Surely he could have dug up  better people to ask about K &amp; C.And as an earlier review has said,  the film can't make up its mind about what direction to go in.For those  of you seeking proof of a Courtney-headed conspiracy, it's not here,  although the documentary does make a compelling case that Courtney is  manipulative and sometimes vicious.For me, the highlight of the film  came near the end when Broomfield essentially hijacks an ACLU dinner at  which Courtney was the keynote speaker. As Broomfield begins to ask a  question of Courtney, the head of the ACLU shouts &quot;Get off the  [expletive] stage!&quot; Great irony.So, unless you're a big fan of  Broomfield, Kurt, Courtney, or the Mentors, you should rent this, but not  buy it. IMO, it's not worth watching twice.",N/A
213767,"Unlike the glossy and melodramatic ""The Day After"", ""Testament"" is a low-budget PBS film that will keep you riveted to your seats.  It is about the aftermath of global war as seen from the eyes of a small town, and in  particular, one close-knit family.  Be forwarned, this movie is powerful  and unrelenting.  As the movie moves forward, it becomes more and more  depressing, and by the time the credits roll up, the viewer is spent.As  stated by the other reviewers, Jane Alexander's performance is nothing  short of magnificent, and I've never seen anything to match it.  (If memory  serves me, I believe Kevin Costner has a small part in the film--although I  am far from certain about this).  Although you won't have any warm fuzzy  feelings after you turn off the VCR, this is a film that shouldn't be  missed.  Between 1 and 10, ""Testament"" gets a solid 9.",Testament VHS

293441,"The first time I saw &quot;Persona&quot; as an eager college student many years ago, my reaction was &quot;huh?&quot; I have seen the film several dozen more times since then, and much of the mystery remains, revealing  another dimension with each viewing. Since Bergman's retirement and  subsequent autobiographical writings, John Lahr speculates that this film  is clearly about the two sides of Bergman's mother--and he makes a  convincing case.  Someone else here has posted that the film is really a  disection of schitzophrenia. I have made the argument in the past that the  movie is about...the movies.  The working title was  &quot;Cinematography,&quot; and Bergman has expressed this duality about  the role of the artist/filmmaker in the past and the trickery inherent in  the process of making and watching films. My point is that all the  above--and more--is true. Critic John Simon has stated that &quot;'Persona'  is to film what 'Ullyses' is to the novel.&quot; Yep...at least.",Persona VHS

3672,"I can't express with what anticipation I look forward to this dramatization of C. S. Forester's superb Hornblower novels or the equally crushing disappointment with which I viewed the result.  Once again, a  masterpiece of literature has been destroyed by a screen dramatists attempt  to &quot;improve&quot; it.  Again and again, plots, incidents and  characters have been altered from those set forth in Forester's novel  &quot;Mr. Midshipman Hornblower&quot; and in every instance the  screenwriter's decision has cheapened or weakened the end product.  Worst  of all have been the attempts at &quot;political correctness.&quot;  I can  never remember Hornblower being portrayed as being so buddy-buddy with the  common seaman, Forester (accurately) depicted the distant if respectful  relationship between the two seafaring classes.  And Hornblower never never  NEVER expressed any sympathy for the French Revolution!  The scene where  the French villagers sing the Marseillese while their compatriots are  executed never appeared in the novel and was of course blatantly stolen  from &quot;Casablanca.&quot;  (I might add that in my opinion that cretins  who burn works of art for firewood and use rare books to prop up table legs  deserve anything they get!)

Her outer physical beauty does not alter the fact that deep inside, her character is a ruthless, evil, cold  blooded killer. It just goes to show that you can't judge a person by their  physical appearance.

However, I was pleasantly surprised and  charmed by this wonderful and hilarious adaptation of the Christmas classic  by Dickens.  My two favorite characters, Gonzo and Rizzo, help keep the  audience's interest by mixing classic narration with comic slapstick. Those  two have the best chemistry in the film!  Michael Caine is excellent as the  embittered Scrooge, and I love the songs and the other Muppet creatures.  Although I cannot help but watch it with a sad heart, I know that somewhere  Henson is looking down on this Christmas Carol and smiling proudly.",N/A

388026,"The film could have (and should have) been better.  Especially since it was written by Ron Moore and Brannon Bragga who wrote the far-superior follow-up &quot;First Contact&quot; 2 years later.The films good  points: excellent special effects, fine acting, and an engaging musical  score (especially for Dennis McCarthy, a television composer).  I  especially enjoyed seeing the Enterprise crashing into the planet's  surface-something I have always wanted to see in a &quot;Star Trek&quot;  film (I was also pleased to see that cruise ship trashed).  I also enjoyed  Picard's speech at the end concering our own mortality.The negative  points: as was the case with &quot;The Next Generation&quot; TV show (and  now with &quot;Voyager&quot; and &quot;Insurrection&quot;) this film  utilized a great deal of techno-babble.  The subplot involving Data's  emotion chip was pointless but I was strongly  amused with his profane  reaction to the Enterprise being in danger.Regarding Kirk, I can't  help but feel as if the film would have been more dramatic if Kirk's  idealized life in the Nexus had involved a life with his son David whom he  never really knew until shortly before his untimely death in  &quot;ST3&quot;.  Imagine Picard trying to pull Kirk away from that.I  was also disappointed with the fact that Kirk didn't interact with other  &quot;Next Generation&quot; members other than Picard. Finally Kirk's death  (no surprise-everyone knew about it long before the scene was even filmed)  just wasn't dramatic enough. Despite all of the films flaws, the film was  enjoyable-heck, it was still better than &quot;Final Frontier&quot; and  &quot;Motion Picture&quot;.",Star Trek Generations VHS

103773,"&quot;L.A. Confidential&quot; possesses many of the good qualities that the great 40's film noirs displayed, but the filmmakers' desire to resort to fashionable 90's movie trends unfortunately riddle their piece with  fatal flaws. First the good--1.) The visual style of the film: In an age  where many movies look like nothing so much as feature length trailers,  (&quot;Usual Suspects,&quot; &quot;The Negotiator,&quot; MOST others)  &quot;L.A. Confidential&quot; was refreshingly filmed with truer visual  integrity. Also aiding is Dante Spinetti's exquisite color cinematography.  2.) The approach to character portrayal: This is one of the few films you  will see nowadays in which the performances are fully worked out, and not  sold on cute little epigrams, and other such stupid cop-out devices. 3.)  Guy Pearce: Among the performances in &quot;L.A. Confidential,&quot; his  impressed me the most, successfully avoiding most of the cliched  personalities of this criminally weak movie age. His effort goes further in  establishing him as a multi-dimensional character than the script does. 4.)  The prescence of intelligence in the script: Such a hard commodity to come  by anymore, scriptwriters Curtis Hanson and Brian Helgeland seemed to be  interested in doing more than just selling the story with star names, big  budget, and promotion. Now for the unfortunate bad--1.) The body count:  This offends on several points. A, not only does the ludicrously enormous  body count of about two dozen not fit the time period of the story, but no  realistic reaction of horror and outcry from government or public towards  the mass butchery ever comes up, making it seem not out of the ordinary for  the 1950's, seriously undermining its persuasiveness; B, the widespread  killing does not fit the spirit of film noir, which always had discreet and  realistic body counts (&quot;Maltese Falcon,&quot; 3; &quot;Big  Sleep,&quot; 5; &quot;Chinatown,&quot; 4; etc.); and usually the deaths  occured offscreen in order to enhance the plot surprises. C, the realism of  showing the cop or detective as more a victim of violence than a cause of  it is jettisoned. And this is because of D, the film's tragic decision to  resort to fashionable 90's gratuitous bloodshed and sadism as its  motivation for excitement, completely going against the classic film noir's  practice of hinging it on character intereaction and plot developments. 2.)  Attempts to portray the characters as multi-dimensional are emetic,  especially in trying to arouse sympathy for Bud White and his ultra-violent  behavior with a sob story of his unhappy childhood which is way out of step  with the rest of the film. The classic film noirs never hazarded to sell  such melodramatic excrescences. 3.) The refusal to break from tiresome 90's  cliches such as: A, the typical big shoot-out finale. Not only does this  again stray from the spirit of film noir, but the mindset of having to  provide blood-spurting fireworks in an attempt to make sure that the  audience leaves the theater satisfied is a pure cop out on the part of  filmmakers everywhere (I mean, who couldn't have guessed it was coming?).  Even &quot;Chinatown,&quot; which appeared in an era in which climactic  gory showdown were fast becoming popular, did not marr its integrity with  such an obvious device. B, the stereotypical 90's portrayal of the  &quot;hero's&quot; (Ed Exley) method of taking charge. Let's see, poor  repressed fellow tries to adhere to proper procedure while investigating,  can't get anywhere, so--casting off his repressive principles--he becomes  nastier than criminals, who then tell him what he wants to know, leading to  solved crime. What ever happened to the uncompromising Marlowe or Spade,  who ferreted out the information with cunning and shrewdness?  4.) Dialogue  is rife with four-letter words, most gratuitously inserted to establish its  &quot;adult&quot; status. 5.) The script is too long, the 2 hr. and 15 min.  running time seeming to have become the standard for films in this flabby  cinematic age. 6.) The outright celebration of corruption and violence:  Since not even the extortionist &quot;hero&quot; is sympathetic; and since  most of the killings are shown in such a graphic and jazzed-up way, this  film is an incitement and unadulterated endorsement of domestic terrorism.  7.) And most fatal, the fact that the entire outcome of the plot hinges on  an alarmingly weak thread, featuring a redundant character: As it finally  turns out, the only way that Ed Exley and Bud White can end their bitter  rivalry and unite to solve the crime is completely dependant on a scene  where Exley visits the hooker, Lynn Bracken--whose only purpose in this  film is to serve as the object for whom the two lock horns over--who then  proceeds to step WAY out of character, and suddenly rips her clothes off of  and they have sex together. This critically lame thread seems concocted out  of pure desperation by the filmmakers; for if Exley doesn't do this, the  entire film crashes in flames. They don't create the meaty roles for women  in the film noir thriller these days like they once did for Mary Astor, Ava  Gardner, Gene Tierney, Lauren Bacall, Faye Dunaway, and others. 8.)  Finally, while not a flaw, the acting has been generally overrated. Kim  Basinger's portrayal of a character that proves to be totally unnecessary  to the film--outside of her physical body, that is--is not exactly awful,  but is far from good. Let's face it, she walked away with an Academy  &quot;compensation&quot; prize for &quot;L.A. Confidential&quot;; which,  alas, could not displace &quot;Titanic&quot; in the minds of the  popularity-conscious voters for most every major category. Kevin Spacey's  performance was intelligent, but nothing really beyond what any decently  good actor that was interested could do. Any nit-wit could have been cast  in the unpersuasive role that Russell Crowe filled. So, in conclusion,  there was a great film in there somewhere, but, sadly, the makers of  &quot;L.A. Confidential&quot; failed to rise to the task of creating a  superior example of film noir--the sort that we have not seen since  &quot;Chinatown&quot;.",N/A

In addition to the standard director's/actors commentary audio tracks,  there is also a complete side of the disc with previously unreleased  footage.

409715,"Well done to Anchor Bay for this latest release that presents the Zombie Masters' classic on a single side of a DVD (though more would have been nice!!).  The film has never looked or sounded better.  A minor gripe - in  the early SWOT team raid, skin colours did tend to merge with the green of  the tear gas, making even the police occasionally look like zombies!Over  hear in England, I was first introduced to this ground breaking horror  movie as Zombies: Dawn of the Dead - and therefore saw the Dario Argento  (slightly shorter) cut.  Recently though, the wonderful BBC broadcast the  'US Cinema cut' - apparently unmolested.  This edition of the DVD also  purports to be the US Cinema cut but I did notice some differences -  noteably, the clear-up scene in the basement of the 'projects' building and  the biker attack on the mall.  The BBC cut showed our hero popping bullets  through the sheet covered heads of several bodies in the basement, then  lots of sniper rifle close ups of heads going pop in the biker attack.  These 'gory' extras seemed missing on the DVD.  Does anybody know the score  on these differences??Another gripe is with the extras on this disk -  it's good to see the Dario Argento 'talking' scenes, but what about the  extra gore scenes they actually mention in the on screen text??  The  slapstick gore is what makes this movie stand out and extras on this front  are surely what the majority want to see?  The mall advert is intesting for  about as long as it's duration (a minute) and there's no supplemental  behind the scenes footage.  What about an interview with the filmaker?  Or  one with Argento on why the differences for Europe?  And who hasn't  wondered 'where are they now?' about their favourite cast member - ideal  fodder for an anniversary extra!?!This is a must have DVD for any fan  but it would've been nice if Anchor went to the depths that Criterion do  for some of their releases.",Dawn of the Dead VHS

189625,"This is one of the great existential movies of all time.  I like to compare it with Herzog's ""Aguirre Wrath of God"".  On one hand, the source of courage is faith; on the other, the source of courage is hubris and greed. I also like to compare Black Robe with Dreyer's masterpiece, The Passion of Joan of Arc, because in the end, through their faith, the protagonists are transfigured.Black Robe and Aguirre put me in awe, not only at the scenery, but at men like the Jesuit priest-martyrs of North America and the conquistadors of South America, plunging into the infinite green voids, never to return.

284172,"This is a very special film, in that it was the only one to be directed by Charles Laughton. Very Germanic in it's creepy photography, the movie has much symbolism and it very well acted. I can see why it wasn't a success in 1955, it being ahead of its time.  It plays like a fairy tale and a thriller all at once. I liked the old uncle played by James Gleason, Evelyn Varden is an amusing pain as Icey Spoon and Mitchum is genuine and convincing as the psychotic 'preacher'. I wasn't crazy about the artificial set where Ruby goes to find love. I felt Lillian Gish gave the best performance in the film.Creepy is the scene where the children's mother (Shelley Winters) is shown beneath the water, drowned by Mitchum. My favorite part is where the kids are sleeping in the hayloft and John wakes up in the wee hours and sees Powell's sillouette riding a horse singing &quot;Leaning on the Everlasting Arms&quot; - he remarks to himself in horrific disbelief &quot;Don't he ever sleep?&quot; The music is hauntingly realized although the scene where Pearl sings a song in the rowboat with John is ridiculous - a child her age wouldn't sing such lyrics.",Night of the Hunter VHS

34547,"WHY HASN'T THIS BEEN ISSUED ON DVD? 'Swing Time' is a film which defines the poetry and grace of the screen's greatest dancing combination, Fred  Astaire and Ginger Rogers. Forget that this is mono sound, and the images  are black and white. The dancing is as modern as today; the spirit of the  film as youthful still as its stars were an extraordinary 63 years ago. The  casual insouciance of Astaire and Rogers in a scene such as the farcical  dancing lesson which turns into a dancing tour-de-force, 'Pick Yourself  Up', fills one with exuberant joy on the 50th viewing. Fred Astaire is  grace itself, with his apparent ease concealing the regime of practice and  preparation which lay behind every step. As for Ginger Rogers -- her lithe,  sensual body, her strong shoulders and willowy frame, make her a delight to  watch in this and all the staire/Rogers films. Pure sex appeal in dance!

Halloween was a thrill ride primarily because it relied on a character with motivation for  mayhem and yet not a drop of blood was spilled. Any film can scare by  flashing gruesome images, but Halloween delivered a Psychoesque approach to  film-making.I still look over my shoulder in the shower after Phycho, and  I'd think twice before babysitting alone after Halloween. H2O is a plot  based, terrifying and surprisingly believable follow up of the characters  that made this film great.If they managed not to spill any blood in it, I  would've given it 5 stars!

49783,"First a suggestion to the viewer below from Rockwall. You need to see this one again. In terms of comedy, &quot;That Old Feeling&quot; is bubbling with it !  Anyone who knows anything at all about Bette Midler, knows that  her snappy wit and peppered dialog go along with the program.  As a film  star who meets up with her writer  ex-husband after 14 years at their  daughters wedding, Bette and Dennis Farina bounce beautifully off one  another. The dialog is quick and sharp , and Bette is at her best in her  scenes sparring with Farina. Paula Marshall and Danny Nucci are good as the  younger romantic leads, and David Rasche and Gail O'Grady stand out as the  present spouses of Midler and Farina, but it is Bette, as always who steals  the show. Though the characters break all the rules of taste and family  stability, you still root for them to kiss and make up in the end. Romance  and comedy are mixed to perfection here. Carl Reiner did a fine directing  job.",N/A

It is  a voyeurs wet dream this movie is.What I enjoyed most about this film  is the dreariness of the way it was filmed, and of course the eerie music  to go along with it. Only ignorant people can't look past the sex and nudity.  It  is also a compelling tale of a loser who gets his rocks off by watching  other people's lives like he is watching a soap opera.  He does this by  installing hidden video cameras in all the rooms of the apartment  building.......creepy, very very creepy.Sharon Stone shines here, in a  very underrated thriller.

With &quot;Amadeus,&quot; we're presented with a compelling, albeit inaccurate, portrayal of the maestro's life, and  the results are beautiful!The strength in any good movie always starts  with the acting, and &quot;Amadeus&quot; is well-equipped in that catagory.  F. Murray Abraham delivers a great performance as Mozart's envious  colleague, Antonio Salieri, while Tom Hulce hands us a memorable enactment  of the title character. Added to the mix are fine efforts by the supporting  cast, rounding out the presentation.Imagery is crucial in films of this  sort, and we are not disappointed in this area; cinematography is excellent  and art direction is fabulous. The opera scenes are magnificent, making the  viewer feel as though they were present.The only qualm that I have with  this film is that it's slightly too long. Those interested in the subject  will have no problem with it, others may be somewhat tested. Nonetheless,  my above rating should read: &quot;4 1/2 stars.&quot;Don't fret over the  historical inaccuracies of this work, if you want the &quot;real&quot;  Mozart, watch a documentary.

With one eye out for scandal and the other looking it all as a joke, Bunuel's first  film (with collaboration from Dali) is a concentrated piece of sonambulist  nonesense.  Patched together by an illogical sequence of events, the movie  follows the criteria of a proper Surrealist object--disjunctions in time  and space.  (It was supposed to be the passport for both artists in to the  Parisian Surrealist circle.  And what a passport it was.  It proved to be a  veritable succes de scandal.)  But it also contains the seeds for the  future work of this auteur. Luis Bunuel went on to have a strange career,  working at MoMA at one point, a commercial director in Mexico, and finally  an internationally recognized filmmaker. Un Chien Andalou was to be the  ground zero for Bunuel.  Essential filmviewing.",N/A

In fairness, I'm  sure alot the reviews here were written by teens, and I might have liked  Never Been Kissed if I was a teen myself. But I'm in my late 20's now and  seeing the same old teen cliches is tiresome. The dialogue in this movie  was clunky, with rarely a funny sentence spoken by any of the characters.  I've always liked Drew Barrymore, her sweetness comes across as genuine,  and she was pretty likeable in this movie and fun to watch as well. But the  intended message in this movie was this, if you're born ugly you're not  worth a damn because did you notice how better-looking Drew became as the  movie progressed? This coincided with her growing popularity with the other  students. In real life, Drew isn't ugly, and neither was her outcasted  &quot;geeky&quot; friend who was supposed to be unattractive as well. Other  cliches: the young good-looking heartthrob teacher, the dumb jock, the  three inseperable shallow bimbos who get what they deserve in the end  (shocking), aren't these same three girls in every teen movie? The black  guy with nothing but bad one-liners, and of course the embarrasing final  scene where the &quot;positive message&quot; speech which is spooned down  your throat like barium before a stomach x-ray.

130252,"It's fair to compare this with &quot;Three Good Men&quot;, just another branch of service involved here, Army not Navy. (Also, in Three Good Men the incident takes place in Cuba, outside of FBI jurisdiction and what  might be termed as a hostile environment). Nonetheless, they are both about  an investigation, but 3GM ends up in the courtroom for a suspenseful  finish, while General's Daughter ends with special effects. It boils down  to a question of tatse, if you like SFX centre stage and acting on the side  this movie fills the bill. As good as I think Travolta is, and he really  isn't bad in this movie either, he delivers a cooky cutter performance. The  location or venue is interesting - an army special ops training ground  (attention has been paid to make the film realistic). Further, the film  does have its moments of suspense, but it becomes pretty clear how it will  end - early on. Travolta plays a sergeant who happens on to a murder while  investigating arms smuggling from the base. He's a sort of Rambo character  in the CID division (Criminal Investigation Dept), and his beligerant  attitude with senior officers is somewhat amusing if not realistic. He  meets the girl who is murdered, naturally likes her, finds somethings  upseting about her in his investigation, and goes gunning for the murderer  with a few &quot;Sirs&quot; thrown in to remind us of his rank!

It is like spending a good two hours  with a next door neighbour. This, the most revered of his films, takes a  simple story of an elderly couple visiting their neglectful grown-up  children, which could have been a melodrama; instead he elevates it to a  philosophical medidation on the transience of human existence and  privileges of living.

116137,"It always seems as though the same concept gets sold to a variety of Hollywood producers at about the same time &amp; a race is on to get out a product.  Last year two big rocks came to hit the Earth in two different  movies, for example.  The current big trend is Cyber-Space or alternate  reality.Three movies have been released at almost the same time about  this theme: The Thirteenth Floor, eXisTenz, and The Matrix.Matrix is,  admittedly, a lot of fun, even if it lacks the maturity of eXisTenz or the  more pure Sci/Fi attitude of Thirteenth Floor.  Matrix plays more towards  an action/adventure crowd and makes frequent use of the same type of  special effects as can be seen in those pants commercials where the kids  are dancing, then seem to freeze in mid-air.  Kind of neat, but we've seen  it before, and soon it will go the way of &quot;Morphing&quot; which T2  brought to a whole new level but isn't used too often anymore because of  the been-there, done-that attitude.Also, Keanu Reeves' final showdown  with the Computer Agent felt contrived.  He had a phone to catch, after  all, and the fight with these bad guys could have waited until the  sequel.Many have commented on the &quot;what-if&quot; our life is just a  computer program.  Kind of like what if our life is just a dream of the  fantasy and science fiction novels of not so long ago.  It isn't new, and  Matrix, rather than try to make the idea new, turns it into the starting  point for a story of a comic book hero.Most disturbing about this movie  is the scene where the heroes walk into the lobby of an office building and  shoot all of the guards.  This was overly reminiscent of the man who walked  into the lobby of the Capitol and opened fire.  I found the scene difficult  to applaud.  This is in contrast with a scene in T2 where Arnold, after  being told not to kill anyone, takes careful aim and shoots out tires and  lights rather than people.  The scene in Matrix might have played better if  the heroes were given more fanciful weapons.  Luke Skywalker had his  lightsaber, Indiana Jones had a whip.  These were pretty cool toys.  Keanu  Reeves, in the computer generated world, should have been able to come up  with something similarly fantastic.",N/A

Most, when they returned, tried to slide back quietly into film making.  Clark Gable,  for instance, made a good but fluffy film with Doris Day.  Tracy, however,  jumped back with a controversial film about race hatred that has become a  classic.

In Black Rock, he finds a trio of real baddies  in Robert Ryan, Lee Marvin and Ernest Borgnine.  The surprising scene in  the town diner between Tracy and Borgnine is worth the price of admission.

454037,"28. HENRY: portrait of a serial killer (horror-thriller, 1992) Henry (Michael Rooker) lives with his ex-prison buddy Otis whose sister Becky moves in with them. Despite his shy nature Henry and Becky are attracted to  each other. One night Otis and Henry go out with 2 prostitutes. In a fit of  rage Henry kills one of them and with Otis' help kills the other. At first  having second thoughts Otis gets a taste for killing and they set out on a  murder spree. Otis first shoots down a passing motorist. They then break  into a house and slaughter a whole family (dog and all). They record  everything on tape. Otis begins to lose control as his perverse sexual  urges lead him to rape his own sister. When Henry finds out things take a  turn for the worst.Critique: This graphic, low-budget venture was made  in 1986 but due to the material was released 6 years later. The story is  based on the confessions of serial killer Henry Lukas (who allegedly  confessed to more than 500 murders). Since the plot eschews from any  reference of real events the theme is poorly presented. Writer-director  John McNaughton concentrates more on the nature of killing and the people  that commit them. The only sure thing we know as being Henry's murderous  excuse was that his prostitute mother beat him up, and sometimes forced him  to watch her have sex with clients. Besides that the scary thing is that we  don't really get to understand his (or anyone else's) motives for killing.  As is the case with most low-budget films the use of grainy stock footage  and cheap props prove very realistic. McNaughton shows flair by the use of  hand-held cameras (particularly in the disturbing 'family slaughter') and  good use of cinematography (invoking a visionary paranoia and suspense).  The ending further distances us from the nature of evil.QUOTES:  pawnbroker: &quot;Of course it's black and white. What do you expect for 50  bucks? ****** 3-D for God's sake?&quot;",N/A

65627,"I am one of the legion of admirers who believe that this film represents the apex of both James Whale's directorial career and Universal Studios' first cycle of monster movies.  Cleverly scripted, flawlessly acted,  wittily directed, and hauntingly scored, it's a marvel of a movie on many  levels; it works as a horror film, a satire, a black comedy, a social  commentary -- even as a romantic melodrama -- depending on your individual  interpretation.It's a real pity, then, that this rich cinematic  treasure has received such a disappointing transfer to the DVD format.  After experiencing the sharply focused, pristine prints presented on  Universal's DVD releases of &quot;Frankenstein&quot; and  &quot;The  Mummy&quot;, my expectations for &quot;Bride&quot; were  enthusiastically  high.  What a letdown!  The film is grainy, with distractingly poor  contrast -- the actors appear to have microcrobes running across their  faces, like amoeba that you might observe under a microscope.  And there  were a couple of pops and jumps inherent in the source material that I  don't recall having seen on the VHS tape release of this film.The extras  are the only features that keep this  disc from being a complete fiasco.  The poster and still archive is remarkable, and the &quot;making of&quot;  featurette is informative and enjoyable.  The theatrical trailer is the one  used for the film's Realart re-release and not the Universal original.  I  strongly suspect (and hope) there will some day be a &quot;restored&quot;  edition of this movie available. Unless you just can't wait to add this  title to your DVD collection, I have to regretfully advise that until such  an improved version comes along, you spend your hard-earned pennies on an  alternate selection.",N/A

Characters seemed to interact in a way that seemed as if they knew  more about each other than had been portrayed in the film.However, it  makes sense, when you realize that the European version is substantially  longer (by about an hour I think).  I would have enjoyed seeing the  somewhat ambiguous relationship between Mathilda and Leon develop more.  This is a good American  version of what I am sure was a great European  film.

23074,"A terrific, outstanding cast couldn't save this one.  Rule #1 in transferring musical to screen--never, EVER tamper with the numbers.  For some reason, the musical was completely retooled for the film, with half of  its best numbers dropped.  If you've never heard or seen the original  musical production, this version has nothing to do with the actual broadway  show.  Consequently, it's way inferior.  What made the musical great was  that it wasn't just about &quot;Annie,&quot; but Christmas and the Great  Depression.  There's nothing about that in here, so the movie loses all the  poignancy of the original.Rule #2--to make a successful show to screen  transfer, the numbers have to be shot in a fantasy style.  Sounds corny,  but I'm telling  you--it works (See the modern version of &quot;Pennies  From Heaven.&quot; As gritty as the storyline is, it works as a musical  precisely because the numbers are shot so unrealistically). When you shoot  a musical in a completely realistic style, no matter how good it is it will  never have the magical feel that makes musicals feel so special; the film  will just look like a regular movie with a bunch of dopes singing out of  context for no reason.  That's exactly what happens here. There's no magic  or charm in this &quot;Annie,&quot; although the cast had enough of it. Oh,  well--what a shame--this could have been better than it was.",Annie
469718,"While this movie has an R rating and supposedly is not to be seen by anyone under 18, it was made for the 14-16 year old.  The only reason it  would have an R rating is language, and that did become offensive after  about the 200th repetition of &quot;F---.&quot; The movie is flawed from  first to last, but the worst fault is the fact that there is not one  sympathetic figure among the participants, and one starts hoping the witch  will get them quickly and painfully, starting with the foul-mouthed,  egotistical girl.  When there is no one to care about, it becomes nigh  impossible to care about the movie itself.  Now, perhaps the 15-year old  will be much taken with how wonderful this all is (and how &quot;just  f---ing uncool,&quot; I am, to borrow a much repeated term from the film),  but any mature person should find this a  colossal bore.

512478,"&quot;Wild Wild West&quot; was this summer's biggest disappointment. It performed well below the expectations at the box-office, and rightly so. &quot;Wild Wild West&quot; is filled with uninspired and obvious gags, even  worse, it is not at all funny. This is all the more astonishing since it  stars Will Smith, Kevin Kline and the beautiful Salma Hayek. All of them  proofed to be capable comic actors in previous pictures. Director Barry  Sonnenfeld was also known as a man with a freaky sense of humor (&quot;Men  in Black&quot; and &quot;Adams Family&quot; weren't great films, but at  least succeeded in entertaining the audience).Unfortunately, they don't  score big this time. The special effects are good, but the whole films  appears overproduced and the actors seem to wear signs around the necks  which say what is funny about them.&quot;Wild Wild West&quot; is an  example for soulless, uninspired fimmaking (as was &quot;ID4&quot;,  &quot;Godzilla&quot; and &quot;Armageddon&quot;).

272996,"In the tense, edge-of-the-seat tradition of Fail Safe, By Dawn's Early Light is a vivid depiction of how the hair-trigger reactions of the superpowers can be manipulated by persons outside ordinary power circles,  and how the technology and pre-ordained response patterns take on an  inexorable life of their own.As a retired military man, I found that  this film grew more frightening as the initial nuclear exchange faded into  the background and both the civilian and military leadership struggled with  the apocalyptic question of how or even whether to turn off the brutal  cycle of escalating retaliation.  The technical accuracy of the film, both  in the equipment and the tactics displayed, heightened the  effectiveness.What makes this movie stand out from other doomsday  thrillers is its ability to show the terrible strain of responsibility and  indecision on people at all levels of the command structure, and the  personal price paid by those who could handle the pressure and those who  could not.  One particularly harrowing and very plausible scenario shows  two Navy fighters in the process of preparing to shoot down an Air Force  bomber that has been judged to have &quot;turned&quot;, both figuratively  and literally.There are many superb dramatic performances in this film.  Foremost among them are Martin Landau as a desperate and badly injured  President, Darren McGavin as the Secretary of the Interior, suddenly thrust  into a position of leadership for which he is unprepared, and James Earl  Jones as an Air Force General commanding the Looking Glass command center  aircraft.Powers Boothe is excellent as a hot-shot pilot who finds  himself slowly beginning to question his black and white view of the nature  of warfare and his place in the overall picture.  Rebecca DeMornay shows  that, when she isn't given the makeup and fancy costumes to rely on, she  has considerable acting talent to fall back on.This is a nerve-wracking,  very credible journey on the tightrope of nuclear devastation, tautly  directed and masterfully paced, from its suspenseful beginning to its  thought-provoking end.  By Dawn's Early Light remains an effective thriller  even after the end of the cold war.  Highly recommended.",N/A

Technically, he doesn't  really exist. So in a way, Sarah is like the Virgin Mary.

132323,"Tour Hawaii with Elvis Presley!!!  That's a pretty good description of this musical, the success of which marked the end of the singer's attempts  at being a serious actor.  For what it is--a travelogue with music and a  slight plot--it isn't bad at all.  But &quot;King Creole,&quot;  &quot;Flaming Star,&quot; and even &quot;Follow That Dream&quot;  demonstrated that Elvis could indeed act when given half the chance.  That's all &quot;Blue Hawaii&quot; is, though:  half a chance.  The songs  aren't exactly rock and roll, but most provide pleasant listening, and, of  course, this is the movie that introduced the lovely &quot;Can't Help  Falling in Love,&quot; the song with which he would end all of his concerts  in the 70s.  Angela Lansbury is on hand as Elvis' mother, even though she  was only a few years older than him (just as she was only a few years older  than Laurence Harvey when she played his mother in &quot;The Manchurian  Candidate&quot; the next year, a movie in which Elvis might just as well  have been cast considering his apparent manipulation at the hands of  Colonel Parker), and, of course, there are plenty of luscious babes about  for those who don't consider Angela a turn on.  &quot;Blue Hawaii&quot; is  a real mixed bag.  It is, perhaps, the very definition of  &quot;fluff,&quot; and as fluff it is attractive, but it would ultimately  lead to dozens of execrable imitations that would make Presley's movie  career one of the most lamentable in history.

Vincent Price, my favourite actor since I saw &quot;Fall Of The House Of Usher&quot; in 1975, has never really been taken seriously,  because he so often played tongue-in-cheek, yet surely an actor should be  judged by the degree of enjoyment they give you. Certainly his range was  greater than most give him credit for, and he could play it straight, as in  &quot;Laura&quot;, &quot;Witchfinder General&quot; and &quot;The Whales Of  August&quot; for example. &quot;Theatre Of Blood&quot; gave Price the  chance to turn his &quot;hammy&quot; type performance into an art form.  This is EXCELLENT acting by someone clearly in peak form and relishing  every moment and opportunity, and there are plenty to be had. Surrounding  Mr. P. were an assortment of top British character actors. Its well  documented that they were all reluctant to appear and only agreed aslong as  each of the others did, but clearly they too got fully into the morbid yet  hilarious spirit of the proceedings. Vincent Price plays a disillusioned  actor, content to restrict himself to Shakespearian roles but panned by the  critics as a result. When they, not surprisingly, overlook him for an  award, he decides enough is enough, and after a failed suicide bid, goes  totally loopy and commences dispatching these tormentors of his soul at a  rate of knots. The original aspect here is that he kills them in a method  extracted directly from Shakespeare (unless it doesnt quite fit his plans  in which case he merely re-writes the scene!). The opportunity given to  Price to recite passages from these plays is what gives this film its edge,  he does it in such an overboard yet brilliant and memorable fashion that  you WANT him to succeed. Where real-life critics have their only problem,  is that the death scenes are graphically depicted with a surplus of  blood-letting in four of them. Yet it is only the first which is truly  shocking (as Michael Hordern is stabbed to death in the style of Julius  Caesar by a large group of &quot;squatters&quot;) because as soon as Price  leans over the dying man and utters &quot;I am well, it is you who are  dead!&quot; you realise this film is not to be taken TOO seriously and  rapidly get into the gleefully gruesome spirit of the thing. That he will  not get away with it is not a totally forgone conclusion, (I mean hed  escaped justice the year before in &quot;Dr. Phibes&quot;), but  his demise  in a flame-engulfed theatre is definately the ONLY diappointment in the  entire movie (with such originality throughout, fancy killing him by the  same method as in virtually all his Corman-Poe productions!).

469293,"After careful observation, I have come to the conclusion that &quot;The Blair Witch Project&quot; is the best film of the year!  It was the most original, most brilliant, and most frightening.  They also made history  with the now-famous &quot;apology&quot; scene.  What sickens me is the  accumulation of negative criticism this film took from morons who are only  scared by special effects and gore.  People who didn't like this movie need  to go to proctologists and find their heads!  What in the hell is there not  to like?  I loved every minute of this film!  Every frame was a work of  art!  I am also proud to say that the dizzy camerawork did not make me ill,  as many people have said.  Plus it was kept simple, and was more down to  earth than most of today's escapist, hollywood horror films(or should I  say, horror film wanabees).  The other thing that shows how moronic the  people who didn't like this film really are, is that people thought it was  real, and then hated it when they found out it wasn't.  I knew that it was  fake(meaning created by directors with actors) the first minute I heard  about it, and yet I didn't seem to care.  Just because it's meant to feel  real, doesn't mean it is real!  They say people who watch movies know the  difference between fantasy and reality.  &quot;The Blair Witch  Project&quot; proved that statement wrong.  And last but not least, was the  fact that people who hated it said it wasn't scary at all.  How stupid!  This film will scare you to the point where you heart is pounding so hard,  it's liable to explode from your chest!  It's not like those movies who try  to scare you by making you jump out of your seats.  It's a realistic,  gradual buildup of fear that reaches a peak of pure terror that never  resolves itself.  When I say this is the best film of the year, I don't  mean it's an Oscar caliber picture.  The Academy Awards don't nominate  films like that.  A less worthy film like &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; is  more likely to have a shot at an award.

298275,"I was out of the country when this film premiered on television -- when I got home, my parents plunked me down in front of the television and said -- watch this -- and I did, without interruption (they had taped it of  course).  This movie is thoroughly compelling, and features outstanding  performances by Richard Chamberlain, Rachel Ward (why do we not see more of  her these days? ), Bryan Brown, Piper Laurie and of course the late great  Barbara Stanwyk.  The heady mix of Catholcism, ambition, and romance come  to a head more than once in this cleverly crafted soap opera, and it makes  for a real EXPERIENCE -- you go there with these characters and get lost in  their world.  If you love romantic melodramas with sweeping vistas and  stories that age the characters you love and take them through the good and  the bad, all the while underscoring their world with stunning photography,  beautiful music and suspense to boot, you will fall in love with The Thorn  Birds too.",N/A
57591,"I'm somewhat surprised at all the glowing 5-star reviews and true passion for this movie.  While I have to say that I enjoyed ""Meet Joe Black"", gaping plot holes (even for a fantasy) and a one-note performance by the  leading lady (Forlani?) really began to wear on me.I saw this movie  twice.  A two-hour version on an airplane, and recently the three-hour  video.  I must admit the two-hour version had a lot going for it and piqued  my interest for viewing the uncut version.  As it turns out, the two-hour  version was less painful.  It successfully delete all reference to the weak  sub-plot concerning the take-over attempt of Anthony Hopkin's business by  his prospective son-in-law.  Not only was this long, and sometimes tedious,  sub-plot unnecessary, it seemed typical Hollywood and didn't ring true  (basic idea being:  young man worms his way in a high-powered and very  successful business as number two man, gets engaged to beautiful daughter,  and all for the purpose of destroying the business, the man, and his own  fiancee?  As it turns out, the chairman's forced resignation only happened  because of Joe Black's strange presence and Hopkins obvious distracted  state of mind--which seems very contrived to me--cause and effect?).  Add  to that, I am now suppose to believe that this brilliant business giant  (Hopkins) doesn't even check with his private physician (which he must  have, being that rich) about his heart attacks?  Stretched my suspension of  disbelief.What ""Meet Joe Black"" had going for it was the fairly serious  tone of what is usually played as a `light' comedy-fantasy (although it did  have its cute and enduring moments).  Anthony Hopkins (as usual) was a  powerful force and I enjoyed almost all of the other performances,  including Brad Pitt's.  However, the leading lady's `puppy-dog' longing  (and long / silent) stares aimed at Joe Black, while charming at first,  made me cringe by the end of the movie.  And what is with the ending?  Don't you think it odd, after finally realizing the true situation, she  wouldn't walk (no, run) over the hill after her beloved father?  Nope.  Didn't happen.  Instead, she turns and walks off with Joe, amidst the  fireworks, leaving her obviously dead father to fertilize the grounds.  Gee  whiz, folks, happens every day;-)Between 1 and 10, I give ""Meet Joe  Black"" a solid 6.  Honestly, I truly liked this movie.  And while I think  it had real potential of being a 5-star movie, there was just too much  filler and fodder for me.",N/A

181512,"Judge Dredd began life as a comic book character in 1977.  Since then his world has expanded as a satiric metaphor for law enforcement and related issues.It became natural that a movie would be made.  The result is this  exciting and gloriously garish looking spectacle reminiscent of the  overrated Batman films, but featuring a better cast and script.Sylvester  Stallone is perfect at Joseph Dredd.  In the world of law, he IS the law.  Perps don't stand a chance in Mega-City with Dredd, let alone when he  receives most potent help from Judge Hershey (Diane Lane).  The film  explores Dredd's super-hard persona and is quite effective is explaining  why Dredd comes off as little more than a machine.The villain in the  film is Rico (Armand Assante), Dredd's biological brother.  Along with a  renegade member of Mega-City's ruling council, Judge Griffin (a very  effective Jurgen Prochnow), and a Nazi-esque scientist named Ilsa (Joan  Chen with great cleavage and a horrible haircut), Rico plans to populate  Mega-City with a race of obedient clones.  But first they must frame Dredd,  the Judge who sent Rico to prison.  The battle to clear Dredd's name and  stop Rico and Griffin takes up the action in the form of several very  eye-catching action set-pieces, notably an aerial bike chase reminiscent of  the Star Wars films, the lightcycle chase in Tron, and the famed car chases  of Bullitt, The French Connection, and The Seven-Ups.The film's major  flaw lies in the lame comedy of Rob Schneider.  Given the film's otherwise  excellent casting - Max Von Sydow and Mitchell Ryan in particular give  superb performances - the presence of Schneider is especially injurious to  the film.Danny Cannon's direction is good - nowhere better than in the  scene when Griffin learns to his horror that Rico has doublecrossed him  with the clones.  The scene includes a great bit of suggestive comedy; Rico  bellows to Griffin that &quot;I'm about to become a Daddy,&quot; then cuts  to a smiling Ilsa, as though Rico's boast is literal.Despite Rob  Schneider, Judge Dredd is an entertaining sci-fi action yarn.",N/A

42340,"Rarely does a documentary hold a viewer enthralled from start to finish, a feat which The World at War accomplishes from the opening sequence through the closing credits.  The definitive film documentary of the second great  global conflict, this production is first rate in every aspect.  Archival  footage, insightful interviews, intelligent editing and the classic  narration of Sir Laurence Olivier are welded into a powerful video  production focussed on presenting a visual record of the war as opposed to  an editorial commentary.Obviously, this is a British production which  leans somewhat sympathetically toward the English view of the struggle and  concentrates on the European Theater of Operations.  However, interviewees  include representatives of all the major powers, and even relatively minor  theaters of operation (such as Burma, India and others) are covered.The  full range of expected topics are included; the period leading to war,  Blitzkrieg in Poland, the Battles of Britain and the Atlantic, the  Holocaust, Barbarrosa and the Atomic Bomb, naming only a few.The  individual episodes are taut and compact, covering well-defined topics and  timeframes, and work well as individual programs or, as they were intended,  components in a larger picture.  Much of the footage is actual combat  photography; therefore much is black and white and some has less than  perfect production value.  However, this only adds to the overall impact of  the presentation.There is no attempt to glorify the combat, lionize or  villify any of the participants, or to second-guess leaders.  Events are  depicted as they developed and, where tactical or strategic misjudgements  are indicated, they are usually pointed out by persons actually involved in  the planning or execution to the operations.The World at War is a  straight-forward, sobering examination of the central event of the  twentieth century.

393663,"When I was in Korea about ten years ago, I heard about this movie, but I have not seen this move until DVD is released recently.This movie is not for everyone, because it is hard to understand Zen and other underlying  stories (also the cinematography). I am not a Buddhist, but I think I know  better than usual Western viewers. Keep in mind that my review is of  novice.At first scene, you hear very loud warning sounds from traffic  signals and sounds of a train passing by. The sounds from wooden bells  carried by Buddhists have been used to open the closed minds of common  people (fools) by the strong wave energy penetrating into their inner  minds. You later hear sounds of the wooden bell by the monk in the market.  Also, you can hear various sounds from metallic bells and others in the  movie.The Zen koan is also used to open the closed mind by sudden  striking force. You can not easily escape from old habits, stereotypes and  various beliefs which you have accumulated and learned after your birth. To  cut those connections which are usually obstacles to the Way to  enlightenment, you need some sudden and strong force. A sound or koan can  be used for this purpose.'Karma' is a basic principle to make the story  in the movie. The boy killed a bird. He later suffered in water. The cow  symbolizes a kind of lucky guider when you are struggling to escape from  darkness. Due to any kind of guider, you can have a chance to move toward  the enlightenment or Nirvana, which is given because you have accomplished  somethings or have helped other lives during the past life.The woman  wearing black Korean cloth is the boy's mother. She appeared in the dream  of the boy when he struggled to escape from a crisis. I could not interpret  who is the woman who danced when the old monk (master) was to pass  away.There are other 'karma' stories overlapping each other, but I could  not interpret all of them. I believe I can understand most of stories,  after seeing the movie several times more.What is the answer to the  title, &quot;Why Has Bodhi-Dharma Left for the East?&quot;.

Pessimism is the theme of the day (gosh,  imagine that, negativistic attitudes in anime!) and that might  anger/depress some, but shouldn't.

466780,"I first saw Wishmaster at a midnight screening at the London Trocadero in summer 1998. I had been awake for nearly 24 hours but needed to kill some time. I was only 17, not old enough to get into the 18-rated movie, and it scared the hell out of me.As we get older, fewer and fewer movies have the ability to scare us as we all get more savvy and jaded to the formulaic nature of most horror films. I don't know what it was about Wishmaster that spooked me so bad, but I've been a fan of the film ever since.On a technical level, Wishmaster suffers from shoddy production design and direction that is barely above that of a cheap daytime soap opera. The acting is mostly appalling (with the exception of Andrew Divoff, who ravages the role of the Djinn/Demerest), and some of the dialogue is clunky. But, as a whole, the movie excels on pure energy alone. I mean, not only do you have more in-jokes than you can possibly count but even Jack the Ripper himself turns up before Lemmy sings hard rock over the closing credits.There's so much potential, imagination, and over-the-top carnage that the film just whizzes by. A lot of the potential isn't taken full advantage of (the 90 minute runtime keeps things to the bare minimum) but it sets up enough mythology to justify three sequels, the first sequel being the only decent one, however.The plot focuses on the Djinn, that's Wishmaster to you, and his efforts to take over the world. As you can see...it's pure hokum but it's the gory bits in between and the Djinn's wisecracking that make this movie worth the money. The Djinn will never be as infamous or as iconic as Freddy, Jason, Michael Myers etc, but that's not to say that he's not an utterly brilliant character. Divoff is absolutely perfect in the role. Even if all he did was real aloud from phone book he'd be mesmerizing.If you like gore, ghoulish make-up effects, and don't mind horror humor that feels like it was conjured up by a bunch of drunken frat boys, then you'll find plenty to like about Wishmaster.The franchise is as low-profile as it can be, but it hit its height with Wishmaster 2, which improves upon the original in terms of story, but is restricted by a lower budget.That doesn't stop director Jack Sholder from going completely over-the-top with the gore effects or pushing the series more and more away from horror and into black comedy. Once again, Andrew Divoff is absolutely brilliant as the wisecracking Djinn/Nathaniel Demerest. Words fail to describe how funny and clever he is. He completely owns the movie despite the hotness of Holly Fields as the lead character, a thief who accidentally frees the Djinn from the fire opal.The series descended into straight-to-DVD trash after this (which Divoff wisely passed on), but don't misjudge Wishmaster 2, it's surprisingly good and more intelligent than you'd expect.The DVD is old and murky.

Guess what? I cry every time  Travolta brings home Castor's  orphan. It's surprising.

Then he started over-doing that British/Scottish-accent humor to the point that it became annoying, reaching his comedic nadir with Austin Powers, easily the worst comedy I've ever tried to sit through (it was so bad, I had to turn it off halfway through, and I've never looked back).Fortunately, this movie came out before Mike Meyers became truly annoying. It's kind of hard to watch this movie without thinking of some of the SNL characters Meyers created (particularly Linda Richman - HEL-LO!), but his performances are hilarious. His portrayal of Charlie's Scottish father is out-and-out, over-the-top funny, and will have you quoting several of his lines for weeks after a given viewing. Fortunately, his portrayal of Charlie is, relatively speaking, fairly restrained.Anthony LaPaglia is great as the cop who wants to be Serpico (but isn't), and who wants his boss to be like the hard-nosed ones from 70's cop shows (Starsky & Hutch, et. al.) (but he isn't), while Alan Arkin is funny as his kind-hearted boss who tries to oblige him (but can't quite get it right). Nancy Travis manages to be both funny and vulnerable at the same time, so that you're actually rooting for Harriet and Charlie to finally get together. Amanda Plummer is cast - surprise! - as the type of character she's usually called on to portray.

Just your normal kind of guy that is until God (George Burns) requests an  audience with him. He has picked Jerry to carry his message of good will to  an increasingly pessimistic world. But Jerry finds that people are  difficult to convert, he even has trouble trying to make his family  understand that God appears to him as a kindly old guy. His faith remains  strong until his call starts to slowly filter through.Critique: A  surprise box-office hit when first released, it spawned other sequels that  proved interesting ('OH! GOD! BOOK 2', 'OH! GOD! YOU DEVIL'). 81 year old  George Burns shines as the perennial God, a role that he played with sweet  abandonment. His deliveries of lines are perfectly executed.

It is basically a boring trip around the world with  not-particularly-inventive plotlines and sets that seem a couple of inches  deep.  I know that Jules Verne kind of went along with the stereo-typical  views of the Orient and America so maybe the show is true to the book.

It's script, a heady mix of quantum  physics, religious doctrine, and questions about the origins of Christ and  Satan, challenges everything viewers think they know about God, the Devil,  and Man.

But the script's deft mix of science and secret  scripture lifts it above cliche.  Carpenter's skillfull direction creates a  sense of claustrophobic tension that makes you feel as if you're in the  movie.There are few directors who can create this sense of menace even  in daylight scenes but Carpenter pulls it off.

Those who say it  glorifies violence and rape clearly don't know what in Hell they're talking  about. The sheer monstrousness of the anti-hero's actions is meant to serve  as a backdrop for his frightful curative treatment. Rape is never, ever  presented as something either desirable or acceptable. Rather, its  monstrousness is such that the offender must be captured and prevented from  ever doing so again. No one would say rape is acceptable, and neither  Burgess nor Kubrick tries to convey this idea. It is all Kafkaesque  melodrama.

The plot and characters in Paths of Glory are  painted with such a broad stroke, they become somewhat implausible and it  leaves you wondering just how much the novel really has in common with how  the French Army was commanded in WWI.My point being, that the true  stories of WWI provide much more compelling, anti-war drama than this  fictional screenplay - even if based on fact. My personal feeling is that a  disservice is done when history is embellished to no point.

Connery, of course, was the epitome of 60s cool.  Dalton had Connery's determination, Moore his sense of comic delivery - even Lazenby brought a physicality to the role.  Brosnan moves extremely well, too, and I suppose is the cloest thing to the well-rounded Connery interpretation, although I am not a great Brosnan fan.My big problem with this film (besides the music) is the screenplay.  So many of what are supposed to be witty remarks make no sense as replies to Bond (Example - Bond: What would I do without you, Moneypenny?  Moneypenny: As far as I can remember, you've never had me. - This seems a ridiculous thing to say when someone is complimenting you.)

This is a movie that not only presents some incredible, if not stunning, action sequences, but also a smart plot and intelligent screenplay. This is a film that really  works in it's genre to the fullest. Director Michael Bay is a master of  this material and adds great style and vision to  already excellent  material. The screenplay by David Weisberg, Douglas S. Cook and Mark Rosner  has a touch of intrigue here, a touch of adrenaline there, a splash of  rambo here, and the effect is great on the big screen. &quot;The Rock&quot;  never slowes down but never gets dumb either. Elements taken from other  films are lovingly polished to a gloss. Nicolas Cage, Sean Connery and Ed  Harris all give convincing performances that ignite the screen along with  everything else. &quot;The Rock&quot; also has some of the best of all  action scenes. The chase scene through San Francisco is pure excitement and  thrills and amazingly filmed. &quot;The Rock&quot; is intelligent,  action-packed, and a wild, thrilling adrenaline-pumped ride that's also  wonderfully stylish.",The Rock VHS

47275,"New Zealand film wunderkind Peter Jackson's first American film, &quot;The Frighteners,&quot; died a quick and ugly death in theaters shortly after its release, only to return and haunt the film libraries of a small and  loyal group of fans. Jackson, who made his name with a series of  spectacularly gory low-budget horror flicks, surprised the world with his  Oscar-nominated true-crime drama &quot;Heavenly Creatures&quot; (a must  see) and went on to make this more mainstream film with producer Robert  Zemeckis. Michael J. Fox, in a surprisingly good performance, is phony  ghostbuster Frank Bannister; a car accident left him able to talk with the  dead, and now he consorts with three amusing losers from the spirit world  to con the unsuspecting residents of the town of Fairwater. But soon Frank  has a problem on his hands: the spectral source of the town's recent rash  of mystery heart attacks has reared its ugly head. It's cloaked and  skeletal. It's got a switchblade scythe. And Frank is the only one who can  stop it. The ghostly killer is somehow related to a decades-old murder  spree and a frightened woman in a creepy old house-- and to Frank's own  dark past as well. Jackson's filmmaking has a giddy, eerie funhouse energy  to it, and the film veers from disturbing thrills to surreal sight gags and  one-liners with whiplash speed. Surprisingly, it all works, thanks to a  smart script, dazzling visuals and special effects, and several fine  performances. Most notable is Jeffrey Coombs' Special Agent Dammers, a  high-strung FBI agent who comes across as Jim Carrey playing Hitler.  If  you're looking for something conventional, you may leave this film  scratching your head. But if you enjoy slightly off-kilter entertainment,  you'll be glad you dug this one up. Poignant, creepy and very funny,  &quot;The Frighteners&quot; is a bundle of ghoulish fun.",N/A
406016,"Only &quot;West Side Story&quot; and &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; can compare with this lavishly designed, profoundly well-acted rendering of the Broadway smash hit that people still love today. Although Audrey Hepburn is  my favorite actress (along with Ingrid Bergman, Grace Kelly, Kate Winslet  and Marissa Tomei) I still think Julie Andrews should have had the role of  Eliza Doolittle for the film version. It has been said by many (including  Audrey) that although she wanted the part and was grateful for it she did  feel that Julie should have had the part especially after it was revealed  that Audrey would be performing a small part of the singing and the rest of  it would be dubbed by Marni Nixon (the famous &quot;ghost singer&quot; who  had also dubbed Deborah Kerr in 1956 for &quot;The King and I&quot; and  Natalie Wood in 1961 for &quot;West Side Story&quot; and a year after  &quot;Fair Lady&quot; came out in the movies she would be playing as well  as singing the part of Sister Sophia in the film version of &quot;The Sound  of Music&quot; (which was her first on screen performance). Rex Harrison in  the role of his career won the Best Actor Oscar to no suprise that year for  his brilliant portrayal of Professor Henry Higgins. The previous year's  best actress winner Patricia Neil (winner of 1963's &quot;Hud&quot;) had  just had a life-altering stroke and was too ill to attend the '64 Oscars  and announce the year's best actor. So, at the last minute, Audrey was  asked to present the award. When Harrison won he asked Audrey to stand next  to him on the podium to thank her as well as Julie Andrews (who was in the  audience and who ironically won the best actress Oscar that same year for  &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; while Audrey was not even nominated for &quot;Fair  Lady&quot;-due to the fact that the Academy wanted to &quot;punish&quot;  her for stealing the part from Julie) for allowing him to work with the two  of them and expressed his &quot;deep love for...well two fair ladys&quot;.  Audrey and Julie were all smiles backstage for publicity pictures with  Harrison, best director winner George Cukor (who had won his 1st Oscar [for  director of &quot;Fair Lady&quot;] after at five nominations) and Jack L.  Warner (who won the best picture Oscar for &quot;Fair Lady&quot;). This  film is really a milestone in the history of musical films. See it if you  havn't already and see it again if you have.

Here, deep in the starry nowhere, a man  can be as one with space and time; preoccupied, yet not indifferent;  anxious and yet at peace. His name is Joseph Reardon. He is, in this  present year, thirty years old. This is the first time he has made this  journey alone...&quot; A microbe destroys humanity. Librarian Andro tries  to change the past with the help of an astronaut. First-rate actor Martin  Landau plays the nostalgic mutant Andro (&quot;It's good to cherish old  things...

Hope proves a man deathless.&quot; And when he goes back to the  time-portal, turns negative and says : &quot;Find Cabot ! Kill him if you  have to ! Kill Cabot !&quot;. Baby face Shirley Knight plays innocent Noel  who is as gracious as a fairy. I like the whole cinematic aspect of this  peculiar episode. Conrad Hall and his uncredited assistant William Fraker  makes their most  romantic cameraworks. They capture the magic sense of  nature : the chase scene, in the wood, shot with a hand-held camera through  leafs and trees.  There are many reflection shots, for instance :  the  camera's reflection in the beginning of the wedding. The close-ups of  Landau's snake eyes are magnificient when he is paying the landlady with  imaginary money. And when he tells his past memories to Noel : the stylish  montage (a chiarusco on the face,  fade overlaped to fast-moving shiny  clouds  and the futuristic barren landscape) that cinematographer Nicholas  Musuraca uses in &quot;Clash by night&quot;. This is also a sensitive  tribute to Beauty and the Beast  with a sci-fi treatment. &quot;It is said  that if you move a single pebble on the beach, you set up a different  pattern, and everything in the world is changed. It can also be said that  love can change the future, if it is deep enough, true enough, and selfless  enough. It can prevent a war, prohibit a plague, keep the whole world...  whole.&quot;",N/A

Danson could  have played it safe in his career outside of &quot;Cheers&quot;, playing  only Sam Malone-type characters(which he does in A FINE MESS).  But in work  such as SOMETHING ABOUT AMELIA and, in this case, COUSINS, he's willing to  challenge his fans with, to say the least, controversial subject  matter.Despite the premise, COUSINS beyond the kissin' is not too  compelling, except for the late, loony Lloyd Bridges, the above-mentioned  Peterson, and of course Ted Danson.

397962,"I don't care what anyone says; there's no need to compare 1995's Sabrina to the Audrey Hepburn classic. This one, in my opinion, is clearly superior than the original.By default, film as an art form has evolved and matured far beyond where it was almost half a century ago. Unless the original was of undeniable achievement in every aspect from technical to artistic (which the original Sabrina wasn't, if we are being honest), the remake will usually be more refined due to the natural evolution of film making techniques, storytelling, and more sophisticated sensibility. Side by side, the 1995 SABRINA is more clever in dialogue, plot, and direction. Let's not get into how the Hepburn version is better simply because it's the original, or a legendary actress was in it. Remakes aren't inherently inferior, and Julia Ormond is an actress that commands respect, as her acting career has demonstrated. On top of that, Harrison and Greg made much more charming and convincing Linus and David than the original cast.Another touch that made it better was changing Sabrina's Paris trip to becoming a photographer instead of a cook. It gave her so much more confidence and validated her as an individual who's accomplished in artistic achievement, and the artistic endeavor matched her sentimental personality far better.It was  also a great move to have Linus truly be the head of the family by taking out the father. That way, Linus became even more of a figure to be intimidated by, and the weight on his shoulders seemed that much heavier.The original Sabrina didn't do a very good job at convincing us why Linus should fall in love with Sabrina. The 1995 version did a great job showing us how Sabrina managed to melt Linus's icy exterior by being sensitive, understanding, encouraging, and challenging to him.What can I say? I love 1995's version. If you haven't seen it, please give it a try. You will be delighted.",Sabrina VHS

Gregory Peck and Jane Wyman portray parents who have had misfortunes and  love their son deeply.

The weakest link  has to be Dalton though. He had no personality. He played the Ian Fleming  Bond well, but even Ian's Bond needs a little humor or charm.  Still, it  does have one of the most romantic endings of the series.

221582,"One of the reasons I liked &quot;Chinatown&quot; best is that it takes us back to a time when traditional film noir movies were made back in the 1940's.  It owes homage to them, from the style of the buildings and to the  cars and clothing.  I felt like I was stepping into that period of time.  Aside from the &quot;have sex the day you meet&quot; cliche which is  unfortunately in almost every movie, &quot;Chinatown&quot; is believable  and realistic.  The ultimate swipe at realism is the ending, which hasn't  quite pleased everyone.  People need to understand that not only is this  the real world were in, but that Chinatown was where the lead character  Jack Gittes quit working because of it's corruption.  And sadly, that Mrs.  Mulray's attempt to protect the daughter met with death when she tried to  escape, in Chinatown!  &quot;Chinatown&quot; is a metaphor about all that  has happened in the film and in the lives of the characters within it.  That, I feel, is the film's greatest aspect.  As for this DVD, I hate to  admit, it is something of a disappointment, for me anyway.  It does have  some nice things on it: a new Dolby Digital 5.1 soundtrack, production  notes, a trailer, and some retrospective interviews with the creators of  the film.  The film itself has been digitally remastered, making it the  ultimate home video experience.  However, the last time I saw  &quot;Chinatown&quot; was on the big screen, at the 25th Anniversary  screening of the film that sponsored the DVD and videotape release of  &quot;Chinatown&quot;.  There, it was huge, big, and beautiful, preserving  every tiny detail and taking me to a place that movies today haven't taken  me before!  When I played the DVD, it, it just seemed so small, quite a  contrast from the theatrical experience.  At the theaterm the screen was so  big, I wasn't just watching the film.  I felt like I was really there!  I  suppose that is the best they can do with a video release of  &quot;Chinatown&quot;, and you know it's never going to look at good as it  did in the theaters.

It's still a good remake to watch, but now I believe it will never measure up to Hitchcock's standards.I'm not saying Vince Vaughn, Anne Heche, or Jullianne Moore did bad jobs, But we didn't need to try and fix it.  Universal could've done a special re-release of Psycho to introduce a new generation of movie fans to Hitchcock's world.  At least Van Sant, who I respect, got newer fans introdiced to hitchcock, even if it meant taking bad press.And having seen the original Psycho so many times on the DVD player, after seeing so many scenes cut or shortened, it feels like you're watching a TV version, which is what it might as well been.

And the ghostly sight  of those three sculptured beauties swaying and undulating in their  fetishistic undress...ahhh, you won't find anything as deeply or blissfully  kinky as THAT on late-night cable these days!The next three clips,  &quot;Hungry Like the Wolf,&quot; &quot;Save A Prayer,&quot; and  &quot;Rio,&quot; are all well-known and still entertaining to watch.  &quot;Wolf&quot; is the best of the three - as yet another tale of lustful  pursuit and orgasmic conquest/submission, it combines cinematic allusions  (&quot;Gunga Din,&quot; &quot;Bridge Over the River Kwai,&quot; and  &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot;) as camp signposts on a journey into the jungle  heart of feral eroticism.  &quot;Save A Prayer&quot; has some nice romantic  images of Buddhist monuments and native youths stilt-fishing in the Indian  Ocean, as well as a few panoramic aerial shots of a sacred plateau and a  final procession of saffron-robed monks illuminated by torchlight.  &quot;Rio&quot; is exuberantly naive and amateurish - this is the one with  them posing on a yacht in the Caribbean, a neat trick which (unfortunately)  convinced many that the group really did inhabit a continuous episode of  &quot;Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous.&quot;&quot;Is There Something I Should Know?&quot; is a rather vague and  arbitrary bit of classic New Wave kitsch-cryptic surrealism featuring men  in Magritte bowler hats and forbiddingly spare Cubist d&eacute;cor, while  &quot;Union of the Snake&quot; is merely a flaccid and indigestible  boondoggle of Oriental menace and crude forced sexuality.While a dandy  little song by itself, the video for &quot;New Moon on Monday&quot; badly  flubs its potentially intriguing premise - revolutionaries organizing an  underground resistance movement in some unidentified Eastern European  police state.  In what has to be one of the most painful moments in all of  music video history, our lads end up feebly pantomiming their exultant  chorus like earnest teenage wannabes at a talent(less) competition...while  several megatons of pyrotechnics detonate everywhere around  them!&quot;The Reflex&quot; is a colorful and well-made attempt at a  fake &quot;live&quot; video - but the teenybopper quotient renders it just  a little cringe-worthy.  The legendary &quot;Wild Boys&quot; now looks like  an hysterically overblown slab of &quot;Thriller&quot;-era excess -  complete with absurd post-apocalyptic jungle-gym-cum-torture-rack sets;  dizzyingly baroque camera angles and vertiginous cutting; snarling,  shaven-headed zombies in alabaster body paint, tribal-dancing and  somersaulting with atavistic abandon; our hero suspended from a tattered  old windmill and...oh, I could go on, but why bother?  On the other hand,  &quot;A View to a Kill&quot; - the famed James Bond theme - compensates  with a simple self-deprecating wit that makes it stand out as one of Duran  X 2's most cleverly inventive and enjoyable videos.  &quot;Bon...Simon Le  Bon,&quot; indeed!After that we get &quot;the new Duran Duran&quot; -  a bit less flashy, a bit more ""mature.""  &quot;Notorious&quot; has some  nice footage of lean, wiry female models jiving and strutting but the video  is ruined by way too many herky-jery camera movements and worsened by  frenzied, dissonant cutting.  &quot;Skin Trade&quot; has a more controlled  rhythm and makes an appealing use of vivid bright colors and matted  backdrops.  &quot;I Don't Want Your Love&quot; is still surprisingly fresh  and fun...perhaps more so than it was the first time around.  &quot;All She  Wants Is&quot; is a vaguely DEVOesque domestic statement with a lot of  blinding, distorted, hypnotic strobe-neon effects and a pretty, pouting  girl that I can either love or leave.The mid-tempo yawner  &quot;Serious&quot; (the only semi-bearable moment from their gawdawful  &quot;Liberty&quot; album) is the most negligible of the bunch here, as is  the rather pointless retrospective sampling, &quot;Burning the  Ground.&quot;&quot;Ordinary World&quot; is a triumphant return to form -  gorgeous, melancholy romanticism beautifully realized with classical guitar  and the lyrical image of a bride wandering amidst golden-toned boughs of  weeping willow trees.  &quot;Come Undone&quot; is another great song,  although I'm not quite so sure about the video.  Hmmm...an aquarium full of  exotic sea creatures, a ginger-haired young siren chained underwater, a  middle-aged dowdy inserting disparate household objects into a blender, a  tortured transvestite confronting himself in the vanity mirror...are these  folks all meant to represent displaced personalities who have ""come  undone""?The recent (and mildly scandalous) &quot;Electric  Barbarella&quot; is a catchy electronic dance ditty that brings Double D  full circle (cf. Roxy Music's &quot;In Every Dream-home a Heartache&quot;).  This last video - about a battery-operated, remote-controlled, life-sized  Barbie-doll that suddenly animates to dizzy, ditzy life - is light-hearted  and witty, it's also perversely, artificially sexy like a Pedro Almodovar  film.  Zap me, Barbie!",N/A

Whith his limited budget and his equally limited resources he has crafted a picture that asks what is our ultimate purpose or destiny.

Ultimately this movie makes the  viewer realize,in a subtle fashion,the difference between life and death.  &quot;They all end up here eventually&quot; is a quote from the movie  in a chilling scene from this materpiece.  This movie is more of a  social statement than a horror movie so don't expect dazzling special  effects,but do expect a keen sense of the human condition,ambience,a  terriffic soundtrack,and unforgettable performances from(yes)Ruppert  everett and his co-star Nagi(characters name).

I think it's the best, because it doesn't deliberately encumber itself with pseudo-serious and contrived sub-plots  (hetero boy falls in love with homo girl).  Mallrats has the same strengths  as the best Seinfeld episodes, which Time Magazine says might be the best  television series ever. Mallrats is the most entertaining since it's also  the most over the top of the three films, with the same sort of zany humor  as the silent era classics.  Mallrats doesn't try to be anything.  Clerks  and Chasing Amy are excellent films, but they try to be something besides  entertaining.",Mallrats VHS

But it's really nearly impossible to get past the oh-so-hip &quot;look at us; we're spoofing  horror films&quot; attitude which is amply in evidence throughout.  It's  not a total waste of time, but that doesn't mean it's worth seeing.  And  really, the best way to see it is on Friday night in a theatre with a bunch  of screaming high school kids.  THAT'S certainly an interesting cultural  experience.  And...be sure to avoid the sequel like a cholera epidemic.",Scream VHS
290920,"As the title character, Matthew Quigley, Tom Selleck, plays an American sharpshooter hired by an Australia landowner, Elliot Marston (Alan Rickman) to kill dingoes. On arriving in Australia, Quigley immediately becomes  entangled with Crazy Cora  (Laura San Giacomo) who thinks he is her  husband. When Quigley and Cora arrive at Marston Waters, he finds that he  has been hired to kill Aborigines instead of dingoes. He objects by  knocking Marston through double glass doors. Marston has both he and Cora  beaten and left in the Australian desert to die. Saved by Aborigines,  Quigley spends the rest of the movie protecting both them and Cora from  Marston ending in an old fashioned OK Corral type shoot-out.The plot is  weak - typical western fare with very good ""good guys"" and very bad ""bad  guys"" - but the actors are exceptional. Selleck plays his typical take all  comers, macho man who can out fight and out shoot any man, but has  absolutely no idea what to do with a woman. His total inability to deal  with Crazy Cora is hilarious and the heart of the movie. San Giacomo's  portrayal of Cora is excellent progressing from crazy to sane as her  relationship with Selleck adds stability (as an aside, there is ~16"" in  height difference between Selleck and San Giacomo, but excellent  photography hides the fact until the end of the movie). Rickman, as always,  is the best bad guy a movie director could ask for. His evil sneer should  be copyrighted.If you are looking for in depth character development,  deep, intellectually challenging dialog, and conscience raising social  statements, you may want to forego this one. If you want a relaxing evening  with enough action to be interesting and comedy to keep it light hearted,  this may well be just the movie for you.I saw the movie both on the big  screen, television and VSH version. The television version stinks. It is so  cut that it completely destroys the movie. The VHS version is okay, but it  just does not do justice to the incredible photography of the Australian  landscape nor the outstanding musical score.

450036,"I'd say this is the most visually gorgeous movie I've seen in a long time.  The scenes between Redford and the horse are SO lyrical and lovely that you could throw out the movie and just leave in those shots!  Beautiful,  beautiful cinematography.I really loved the daughter in this movie,  which reminded me somewhat of the daughter in Stepmom.  The actress who  plays her, though, does a STUNNING job giving her a bitterness that most  adolescent actresses miss when playing these sort of parts.  In fact, her  character's relationships with her mother and Redford was so compelling  that it quickly overshadows the romance between Redford and Thomas, which  honestly has little chemistry.However, as much as I loved her character,  I HATED Redford's acting as the Horse Whisperer.  He plays the Mystical  Healer with as much cliche and vanity as she plays the daughter with anger  and pain.  Kristin Scott Thomas's acting style is understated and subtle;  yet, to Redford's wooden smiles, she's by contrast a spasm of passion.I still highly recommend the film.  If you swoon to Redford, this will  probably work for you.  Otherwise, you may find Redford's  self-aggrandizement to be a crutch to this film.",N/A
106291,"I kept reading and hearing about Wim Wender's epic German film Wings of Desire on which City of Angels is supposedly based.  So I hunted for Wings of Desire, and after months of searching found an old VHS video with  English subtitles.  Something troubled me after I viewed it(besides the  fact of the English subtitles and that the majority of the time the  &quot;star&quot; angel does most of his monologue as a soliloquy).  And  then it struck me! It was a German movie based, I believe, on a German  book. Having studied German for 4 years and being a Dutchman since birth(52  now, thank you), much of that culture's literature and art work (including  films) are very philosophical and erudite.  Watching Wings of Desire gave  me a nasty headache,  because it was hard to keep up with the depth of the  plot(which was mainly thinking), especially with the English subtitles.  City of Angels, on the other hand, was more understandable because Seth  spoke frequently to his buddy angel, so the soliloquy became a true  dialogue.  Also, the cause for Seth's unrest was introduced close to the  beginning of the movie: Meg Ryan as a very frustrated, agnostic  cardiologist.  The rest of the movie, including Seth's questions about  humanity and immortality, move along at an acceptable pace.  For depth of  plot I suggest you look at Seth when he looks at children, the dying, the  living, at Dennis Franz, who is great by the way.  You (at least I) see the  depth of plot in Seth's eyes and his attempt to touch as mortals touch.  This is not a journey into the deeply intellectual, philosophical,  &quot;heady&quot; part of us, as is Wings of Desire.  City of Angels has a  better tempo, an understandable plot, and, if you think deeply enough about  it, it leaves you with questions that only you can answer.",N/A

112651,"Screwball comedy is supposed to be funny, right? Although the basic story is sound the dialogue is as unimaginative as it can be; apparently three hollywood stars and a famous director draw the attention to this picture,  and made it earn the honors of the 100 best films of the AFI list.  I  really do not understand its merits.  To confer this film the same honors  as Casablanca, Citizen Kane, Double Indemnity and other Hollywood golden  age classics is a terrible mistake.  Even Citizen Kane had moments of  comedy wittier than any scene in Philadelphia Story.  I guess this is a  typical example of what the critics refer by the remark that in the old  times, frequently, it was enough to gather big stars and a famous director  to have a commercially successful film.  Besides, Katherine Hepburn is not  funny at all, when she tries to be funny it does not come through as  natural and one gets the impression that she is just trying to be cute.  Cary Grant was much better in later films, as in to Catch a Thieve, and  Charade.  Jimmy Steward was the only one that stands out.While I laughed  so much watching movies that are not per se comedies, such as Casablanca,  Double Indemnity, and Citizen Kane, I had to make an effort to stay awake  during Philadelphia Story (supposedly a comedy which turned out literaly a  screwball). I also wondered if the music composer was on strike at the time  of filming, because there was virtually none.  For a delicious comedy with  a witty script I recommend Ninotchka, with Garbo and she is very  funny!!!!All the reviews by viewers seems to have a contrary view, and I  thought that I was the only one not getting it.  But, I went to the movie  database here at amazon and found several among the few reviewrs that  agreed with me despite that it took them so much writing in order to say by  the end that the movie was not funny at all.

93391,"Oliver Stone's &quot;JFK&quot; is undeniably an extremely important film. This is a movie that is not just a study of the mysteries surrounding the assassination of John F. Kennedy, this is a study of power and the workings  of power. &quot;JFK&quot; goes into the dark corners of our government and  it's shadowy dealings. Anyone fascinated by the mechanics of politics and  power should see this film. Stone presents a thrilling piece of film that  is incredibly convincing and disturbing. He doesn't subject to all of Jim  Garrison's conspiracy theories. Instead, he uses Garrison as a vehicle to  search for the truth. He uses Garrison as the base to display the harsh  reality of how Kennedy was killed and why. In fact, Stone doesn't use this  to display HIS own thoughts, but to express many theories. This is also a  masterpiece in the technical area with the stunning effectiveness  &quot;JFK&quot; has in the cross-editing, inserting documentary footage  with film footage. The screenplay is brilliant and it's incredible how much  information, characters and powerful drama it contains. The cinematography  is rich and artistic.

Fun begins with Albert  not getting the promotion he thinks he deserves and talks his wife (played  by Airplane's Julie Haggerty) into not moving into a new house- rather, buy  a Winebago and &quot;touch Indians&quot; for the rest of their lives. A  stop in Las Vegas to renew wedding vows turns the dream life into a  disatster, as Haggerty blows there savings at the roulette table  (&quot;22&quot;)  What follows is how they come to terms with this event  and how they try to piece their life together in a trailor park in the  Southwest- the only place they have enough money to buy gas to get to.

458679,"Robin Williams and Cuba Gooding, Jr. got lucky at the Oscars one year. So, the director of &quot;Dreams&quot; decides that he'll get them together to make this film.All right. That's fine.Then, you have to get your  hands on a &quot;great&quot; script, drafted from a novel by...Richard  Matheson...old Twilight Zone writer, wrote &quot;Duel&quot;, &quot;The  Legend of Hell House&quot;, &quot;I Am Legend&quot;, and the great  &quot;Somewhere in Time&quot;...You're rolling along now.Now to shoot  your movie. Give your audience something to stare at so they won't get  bored with all the droning-on about meta-physics and what-not. Ooooo...look  at the pretty colors...and that wierd bird-thing...that's basically it,  folks. It's pretty all right. Pretty shallow.In fact, the only character  with ANY depth whatsoever in this film is Chris, played by Robin Williams,  in a film that is essentially, 1998's &quot;Soldier&quot; without the  violence and with a brighter set. It's really unfortunate, too. This film  had the potential to be great. And on a visual level, it is...don't get me  wrong! In fact, it IS a shoe-in for Art Direction at this year's Oscars and  has a run for its money against &quot;Armageddon&quot; for Visual  Effects.But there's really not much more than that. We're supposed to  see the long-dead family dog running across the flower-field(which looks  like a Robert Frost poem after five doses of Crack) and cry because Chris  sees him again. But Vincent Ward(director of &quot;Map of the Human  Heart&quot;) feels that we really don't have to know much about such  characters, and thus, kills them off as he sees fit. At least THE DOG had  more flesh than Chris's psycho wife, Annie. And when he DOES kill them, you  sit there and wait for the funeral to end, because you really never knew  the deceased that well and they're so one-dimensional anyhow, that you  really didn't care to meet them in the first place. That's part of the  reason that you don't cry in this film. Even Robin Williams(in a  heart-tugging performance) almost feels to the audience, like an actor who  is improvising with zombies that can't think of what to say when he talks  to them. And the only really weepy parts are when we're force-fed the  slow-motion shots of funerals and crying flight attendants who just may or  may not be your family in disguise. Imagine, telling somebody that your son  sucked at football and that he wished he could teach him better before he  died, then all of the sudden...WHAMMO!!! The previously African-American  guy that was standing next to you is SUDDENLY YOUR SON. And that the flight  attendant you smiled at that you are talking to in Heaven suddenly becomes  YOUR DAUGHTER!!! And that the old guy who was taking you through Hell is  suddenly that African American guy who is your son...kinda...sorta...I  think... Why does everyone you know have to be in disguise? Why can't they  just come out and say, &quot;Dad, I missed you&quot;?And they said that  &quot;Mission Impossible&quot; was confusing. This makes that film easier  to understand than Sesame Street!Not much intensity is here either. You  expect an epic trip through hell and right as Chris is ready to face his  fear, we hit a flashback that lets us in on Chris's life; one of about  eighty-thousand that are sprinkled about this movie like too much spice.  Why couldn't we have known these things earlier? It not only throws the  viewer off, it ruins the pacing of the film.And &quot;Heaven&quot;  relies heavily on your beliefs. I believe in Heaven, but I don't believe in  a lot of the mind-crap that was fed to me from this movie. I have lost a  lot of people in my family, but I really don't believe that they're in  their own place, walking around some paint field. Then that means my father  is teaching a classroom of kids 24-7 and my grand-father is in some brothel  in World War 2, getting fed grapes by the clientele. Dante can say what he  wants, but I don't agree with his fundamentalism. Hell is creative and all,  but there's really no punishment for the banished souls. Unless some guy  from Heaven just happens to be trying to rescue his wife and accidentally  ends up walking on your face(see the film and you'll get it).I don't  know. I really wanted to like this movie, but there wasn't much  explanation. Instead, the director focuses too much on making you stare at  floating bodies while the characters all drone on about whether or not they  should have made different choices. If I want to listen to this, I would  have gone to an art-gallery and listened to my Aunt talk to me for two  hours.It would have been the same thing, believe me.--Matt",What Dreams May Come VHS
393838,"I read all of the reviews for this film and even amazon trashed it!  Here is my question.  If you read the book, and you know that whenever they turn a book into a movie it's going to be an obvious abomination, what the hell  are you expecting. Cast all preconceived notions aside and just enjoy the  flick! The Scarlet Letter was a wonderfully acted and directed spectacle  for the eyes.  I am not really what you would consider a &quot;Demi Moore  fan&quot; but I think she did a remarkable job here.  The scene where  Matumba is bathing is enriched with metaphorical images that strikes a  chord in the imagination department, all the while as the movie's integral  scene is taking place between Demi and Gary Oldham, is this not cinematic  splendour?  Yes I will admit, I never read the book, maybe that is why I  enjoyed Scarlet. Overall, this is a descent movie.  It takes you back in  time and lets you relive the puritan hell days on earth, all over again.  A  great Thanksgiving movie, wouldn't you say?We still love you Demi!",N/A
305397,"Hal Hartley's simple, brilliant masterpiece.  Martin Donovan should have won an oscar for his performance as Matthew Slaughter.  All the characters are written to perfection, and they complement each other perfectly.  The  film is as sad as it is hilarious (there are some 50 lines of dialogue that  are worth quoting here).  Matthew Slaughter's character is made all the  more real by the ending.  As an &quot;empiricist&quot; who doesn't believe  in love, he can only understand what it is (love) once things turn in the  wrong direction for him.  The love between him and Maria Coughlin (Adrienne  Shelly) is not one of those stuffy Hollywood romances, but a simple trust  and understanding between two individuals (admiration, respect, trust equal  love!).  Further complicating matters between them are their downright  sinister parents; Matthew's father beats him, while Maria's mother blames  her for the death of her father.  Simple, intricate, funny, sad, and filled  with nuggets of wisdom, this film ranks up there with &quot;Psycho,&quot;  &quot;Wizard of Oz,&quot; &quot;2001&quot; and &quot;Persona&quot; as one  of the crowing achievements of cinema, and unfortunately so very few of you  out there have seen it.",N/A

336610,"With the lone exception of &quot;Laura,&quot; (which was really based on another director's vision), Otto Preminger excercises in all of his films  an infuriatingly self-indulgant, pretentious, clumsy directorial style.  This grossly overlong, overblown, and over-praised melodrama is no  exception. With no sense of either incisiveness or cohesion, the issues  raised often seem to steer uncertainly between social comment and tabloid  sensation; thus, not standing a firm ground in either, one is left with a  puzzlement over just what the film is trying to say? Indeed, one suspects  that here Preminger is playing the yellow journalist. He sees to it that  the so-called &quot;controversial words&quot; are repeated endlessly and  reduntantly, to make sure all the world gets the idea that this film is  some kind of milestone; and to obscure the plot inadequacies. A talented  cast is also left floundering. Stewart was so commonly identified as the  &quot;All-American boy&quot;, that directors often took delight in casting  him in &quot;daring&quot; parts. That is certainly the case here, as the  role does not give him room to display all of his talents; but rather to  play the box-office draw. Even so, he survives the project better than  Scott, whose performance--though important to him as a career move--is  overblown. Really, the effort is there--all actors pull their weight--but  the equivocal treatment often gives no direction. If you don't give a damn  about the narrative line, then the performances may entertain solidly for a  while; but best do it on a lazy weekend night!",Anatomy of a Murder VHS

49893,"&quot;Jurassic Park&quot; is so old, yet... so timeless, ha.  I was a measley 11 years old when this box-office smash hit.  &quot;Congo&quot; was... trash- sawry, Steven S &amp; you die-hard &quot;Mighty Joe  Young&quot; fans.  The '93 &quot;Park&quot; (the prequel) is about a DNA  experiment-gone-awry. Personally, the trivial filler (where no action  occured) is tedious, but when it comes down to the wire and a T-Rex is  bending over you like you're a pathetic ant... that's where it's at.  It's  a little grim for the kiddies, I must admit (when a Seinfeld character gets  the ol' spitz in the eyes and bumrushed in his car, yeah... he died, heh  heh).  But I don't think they'll wake up in a cold sweat- &quot;Mommy, I  dreamt that I watched &quot;Barney&quot; and... he-he spit in Michael's  eyes cuz he screwed up a line of &quot;This Ol' Man&quot;!&quot;  Oh, no-  they'll just eat this up.  The icebreaker is when the cast members are  standing around while CG dinos are running amock like they're about to eat  their last meal.  The highlight, everyone will agree, is when it's  &quot;Tim &amp; Lex vs. The Relentless Raptors,&quot; which takes place in  a friggin' kitchen (scary, I know... but the idea wasn't too far-fetched  for me to engage in).  It's also funny when Lex has this stupid look on her  face while her fork reverberates from the thumping baby Raptor  Untouchables.  Did I mention a dramatic &quot;Tim about to plunge to his  death in the J.P.mobile&quot; scene&quot;?  Heh, heh, that was... kewl!  (Not how he escaped death, but the anticipation that he would fall, yes!)  Towards the end, it progresses into predictability and cheesiness, but  nonetheless, worthwhile (despite a jaded attempt at a decent storyline).  Rent/buy it for the momentary thrill.  All 'n all, Spielberg's got himself  a humourous/thrilling, yet very timeless classic amongst the &quot;King  Kongs/Godzillas&quot; of the film industry.  Heh, heh, kewl.

451355,"Ok, so the movie wasn't as good as the tv show, but it was about what I expected so I wasn't disappointed.  I'm sure most people interested in buying this video have some idea of the plot, etc. so I thought I would  write something useful for those trying to decided between widescreen vs.  pan and scan because I have seen both versions.  If you have a big tv, I  would definately reccomend the widescreen.  But if you have a smaller tv, I  would think twice about it because the widescreen is really narrow- much  more narrow than the ads, which are midway width-wise between the pan and  scan and widescreen versions.  It depends on what you are buying the video  for.  If you are a purist, or are buying it just for the &quot;bee  scene&quot; I would go with the widescreen (the bee scene is alot better on  widescreen), but if you are going for general action flick entertainment, I  would get the pan and scan version!

253600,"For anyone who ever experienced the joys of Christmas anywhere, specifically in the wonderment and magic of Santa Claus, and all that he represents, this movie delivers the goods in a major way.  I love the way  this movie has aged -- its black and white New York, with a Macy's that you  can practically smell, paint a quaint, innocent time, and populate that  time with characters that still have a contemporary freshness to them --  Maureen O'Hara, who is deliciously self-aware, tells her little girl there  are no such things as fairy tales -- having a bitter heart from a man who  has obviously abandoned her.  It is her heart, and little Natalie Wood's  (who is amazingly precocious and adorable) that Edmund Gwynn must melt by  the time Christmas Eve rolls around.  The simplest of plots, with a lovely  cornball quality, tumbles forth with warmth and amusement.  And it is again  the things we do not see but imagine -- as when Kris tells Maureen outside  of Macy's, the 34th Street sign hovering above them -- that he must be on  his way; it is Christmas Eve after all -- that give it a special layer of  Christmas fantasy.  I dearly love this movie, and virtually every remake  pales in comparison.  Gwynn will make you believe -- he justifiably won the  Oscar playing Kris Kringle.",N/A

And this DVD version of the film captures the Techni-colors in ways they've not been  seen since the film was released in the mid-50s.  What's surprising about  seeing the film today (for anyone with a knowledge of where screen morals  were in the 50s) is the fact that it deals with adultery in a way that was  rarely seen in its time.  Spinster Hepburn goes off to romantic Venice,  sort-of-but-not-quite looking for love, and when she finds it, it's with a  middle-aged, married man.  While she doesn't &quot;get the guy&quot; in the  end, she isn't &quot;punished for her transgression&quot; either.  It seems  a miracle that the Church allowed such a movie to be made in the 50s--and  in Italy no less.

402182,"To me, the poignance of On The Beach lies not in it's anti-nuclear war message, which mercifully was proved wrong by events in the real world (Julian's speech railing against the idea that nuclear weapons could keep  the peace is the one dated part of the film.  It's now evident that the  reason why there never was another ground war horror on the order of WWI  and WWII was *because* of the atomic bomb) but in it's human elements, and  exploring how people react to the reality that life is fast coming to an  end for all of them.  In this instance, a nuclear war is simply a  convenient duex ex machina to see how ordinary people react to the trauma  facing them.  There are fine performances all around, but to me the real  strength of the movie is Ava Gardner's touching performance as Moira  Davidson.  Indeed, there is an almost eerie autobiograhic quality to it  since Gardner had many things in common with her character.I think  sooner or later, people will look back on &quot;On The Beach&quot; and  realize that it's timelessness lies in it's exploration of the human  condition and not it's political statements which in my opinion are no  longer relevant to the real world.",N/A

112219,"Supposedly, Cary Grant, aged 54, was contemplating retirement until Alfred Hitchcock asked a fourth role of him. Thank goodness he went for it! As good as Psycho is, it should never have eclipsed North By Northwest as  Hitchcocks most famous film. This is his masterwork, (in my opinion one of  the top three best films EVER), and for innumerable reasons the end result  is just an astonishing accomplishment. Justifiably famous for those two  scenes, (and the cropduster sequence is totally thrilling, though I always  wondered why the pilot decided to go kamikaze and plough into the petrol  tanker!), it has so much more to recommend it. Grant, present in virtually  every scene, is superb, and the Academy should forever hang their heads in  shame for ignoring this actor. He is matched, however, by Jessie Royce  Landis,(funny already in as much that she was also 54 yet plays his  mother!), who is utterly hilarious in her role. Everyone infact is good  form, and its a pity that James Mason, in his only Hitchcock performance,  is offscreen for an eternity after an impressive initial scene opposite  Grant. Alfred Hitchcock simply couldnt have paced this film better, and  what a wild ride it is, though if forced to pick a favourite moment it  would probably be in the auction room. I can never forget the lady turning  to call Grant a &quot;genuine idiot&quot; and him thanking her for it! This  is simply scintilating entertainment of the very highest order, I defy any  reasonably minded person to weary of it, because the second you see the  M.G.M. lion in green, and hear Bernard Herrmans brilliant score, you know  your in for one of the biggest treats of your life!

271904,"Abel Ferrara's 1990 crime/gangster film 'King Of New York' represents a transitional period for the talented and criminally misunderstood director.  This change is exemplified by the utilization of 'European style'  cinematography and emphasis on character study.  What seriously detracts  from 'KONY' is Ferrara's inability to sustain a consistent tone or feel  throughout the duration of the film.  His reliance on stylised action  sequences, no matter how technically proficient, and inclusion of rap music  after dramatic scenes, particularly in the final sequence, lacks the  effectiveness that such a juxtaposition requires.  On the plus side, Joe  Delia's haunting score perfectly compliments Ferrara's visuals,  particularly in the scenes where a blue lens is used to create a thick,  brooding atmosphere.  Christopher Walken potrayal of a charismatic gangster  with a slight philanthropic inclination is easily one of his best  performances.  His performance elicits strong feelings of ambivalence from  the viewer(IMO) and I'm positive that was Abel's intention.  There is an  interesting subtext residing within the plot that questions the notions of  equality and justice that are fundamental to our democratic society.  Luckily Ferrara has adopted an emotionally detached style and refrains from  judging his characters, irrespective of their profession and moral/personal  choices.

When Claudette Colbert finished making this film, she told her friends: ""I've just finished the worst picture in the world!"" She was nominated for an academy award and at the ceremonies,she was dressed in a traveling suit,ready to catch a train. Later in the evening, the French-born Colbert (31) was presented the academy award for the best actress of 1934 (six-year old Shirley Temple handed it to her). Gable, who was on suspension from Metro won for best actor. It was also the best picture, and Capra won as best director. The movie is actually noted for the fact that men's undershirt sales dwindled considerably when Gable revealed his bare chest!

77154,"The Return of the ink ant, I mean, Pink Panther, is a work of comic genius.  Peter Sellers as the idiot inspector, Herbert Lom as his boss and Chief of Police deliver two of the most inspired comic performances ever  captured on screen.  The rapport between the two of them is worth ten  thousand Shagging Spies, and eight thousand twenty Lying Liars!  This might  sound harsh, but I'm sure Jim Carrey as well as Mike Myers would agree.  They are, after all, admitted Sellers fans.The film begins with the  theft of the famous Pink Panther diamond.  The famous inspector who rescued  it last time it was stolen, Inspector Clousseau (Peter Sellers), is  assigned the case.  Completely incompetent, yet unwaveringly persistent,  the inspector manages -with the help of a phone call from his boss- to  solve the crime and apprehend the infamous thief.  This sounds easy enough;  however, things get complicated when Inspector Clousseau's own superior  sets out to murder him!",N/A

This is just wonderful. There are at least an additional 15 minutes added on to this film which adds much more depth to the characters.This is a double sided disk with lots of extras. In addition to the two films, there is a brief interview with Romero about his ""lost films"" (this and ""There's Always Vanilla.""), an hour long feature about the films of Romero...and I was MOST delighted to see an interview with the lovely Jan White (Joan)! I have always wondered what ever happened to this actress, and it was great to see her! Not to mention the trivia about the film itself.The film quality was not superb, but then I don't think it ever was. Those complaining about this should keep that in mind.You won't find the commentary version of the movies as I've seen in other Anchor Bay Romero DVDs (""Martin,"" ""The Crazies,"" and ""Knightriders"" for example) but the great extra features more than make up for this fact.I don't have much to say about ""There's Always Vanilla""... it wasn't too bad, but as in the case of several Romero films, was very interesting from the standpoint of seeing images of Pittsburgh from 30+ years ago.

It is easily the most intentionally comic of the series, and features a cleverly plotted mix of real drama and sci-fi, and placing the action in  then-present day Los Angeles gives it a peculiar point of view, one that  succeeds almost brilliantly.  Kim Hunter and Roddy McDowall inhabit their  roles so completely that you believe utterly that they are apes, and that  their peril is real.  Since I love the twists in a movie that give it  gravity and an enduring quality, I love the strange sense of doom and  tragedy that pervades this movie, even when it is at its most humorous.

An interesting thing happened to me, the day before I watched Insomnia, I watched Deep  Blue Sea (which is unimpressive and overall typical hollywood cheese) but  the first guy to get bitten by a shark is Stellan Skarsgard. At the time I  didn't know who he was, but when I put Insomnia in my DVD player I  recognized the face and became instantly intrigued with the familiar face.  I enjoyed his performance as the detective whose &quot;mistake&quot;  eventually leads him down a spiral of deceit, conspiracy, and betrayal.  Skarsgard had just the right demeanor for the role of the tortured  detective, and he kept me interested in the outcome (which came as a  surprise in many ways). Philosophy students would enjoy this film since it  is a study of ethics and morality. I noticed a couple of cleverly disguised  homo-erotic motifs... see if you can find them.

Both TimBurton's films are a zillion times better than Joel Schumachers 'Batman Forever' which totally s**ks, or even 'batman and Robin', which IMO, was quite good, but comapred to Batman Returns and Batman, it was nothing! Danny De Vito was the best actor in this masterpiece! No one can play the Penguin better than he can!  He beats Jack Nicholson as Joker! Michelle Pheiffer was *excellent* as Catwoman/Selina Kyle, but I was a bit dissapointed with Michael Keaton as Bruce Wayne(I love him as batman though). He's not very &quot;Bruce-Waynish&quot;. They should have got someone else as Bruce Wayne! I also think they should have focused on Catwoman a little more.....they dont actually show that she's a very popular villain in Gotham City, and that people are afraid of her! Anyway, the film was terrific in its own right....the storylines couldnt be better....The film was so emotional and I also liked the darkness! The Penguin is a misguided deformed person who was abandoned by his parents because of his horrible looks. He grew up with the penguins, and was always seeking revenge on mankind, because he couldnt be a part of their society. He pretends that he's an angel, and that all he wants is to develop Goptham City, but deep inside, he's planning to make everyone miserable like him. Then we turn to Selina Kyle, who was thrown out of the window by her boss Max (who eventually teams up with the penguin to ruin Gotham City) for reading files which contained most of his evil plans. She vows revenge on her boss, and after realising that she has tremendous powers and skills, she turns into the villanous feline nemesis &quot;Catwoman&quot;. She is one of the most dangerous villains Batman ever faced, but unknown to Batman and catwoman, their alter-egos Selina and Bruce and lovers...and now Catwoman has teamed up with the Penguin to destroy Batman and wreck Gotham City!

The term his character uses  here--&quot;ballbusters&quot;--what he sees as women's power to use a man's  own libido as a weapon against him--is in spirit a lot like his  court-martialled military officer's sneer in &quot;A Few Good Men&quot;:  &quot;You can't HANDLE the truth!&quot;. In contrast, the role Candice  Bergen plays here--a cutesy coed who in one scene gets goofy drunk and  giggles her way through that old Sunday school joke about the hymn about a  bear with crossed eyes--doesn't even seem like the same woman who would  later become a lot more famous as the world-weary know-it-all Murphy Brown.

465320,"Well, here's your chance to find out. First off, you have to deal with the fact that these DVD's are as good a presentation as you're ever going to get. Most of his films were released in Mono, and many in matted formats,  which means that when they're presented on TV, you don't get the black bars  at the top and bottom. Complaints about this last bit are meaningless, as  2001 was his only film released in scope, and the ones that would really  need it -- Lolita and Barry Lyndon included -- are released in widescreen.  Kubrick deliberately shot The Shining and Full Metal Jacket in 1:1.37 for  masking in the theatres and because he couldn't have forseen the  letterboxing craze we're currently in. Many directors chose to release  films not in widescreen because of this (read any one of the biographies  for this info). So, what you're left with are seven of the greatest films  ever made, and released on DVD for a relatively cheap price. How can you  pass this up? Kubrick's view of the universe is dark, totally Hegellian,  and sometimes too depressing for the average viewer. But, those who venture  into the unknown presented within his films are rewarded with a series of  brilliant images that resonate symbolically in ways very few directors  could ever hope to achieve.

195410,"Try to imagine Bruce Lee in a prison drama directed by Peter Jackson. What that idea would produce is an over-the-top spectacle of bloody gore and good-natured all-around fun that no other martial arts film could top. Our  hero, Riki (or Ricky in some versions) is sent to prison for killing the  murderer of his lover. Subject to acts of cruelty by the prison system, he  quickly rips, tears and disembowels his way to the top of the prison system  in a barrage of force that has to be seen to be believed. The violence is  SO overdone (a man actually rips out his own intestines to strangle Riki  with) that humor cannot be avoided. A perfect vehicle for all fans of  gratuitous violence, the film is strongly recommended.",N/A

469534,"I finally saw this movie on video and must say I was greatly disappointed.  This movie was hyped as the greatest scare flick in years, but it did not  live up to its hype.The way this movie was shot is not new (see &quot;84  Charlie MoPic,&quot; &quot;Cannibal Holocaust,&quot; and the UPN docudrama  about a Minnesota family captured by aliens from about two years ago).  Like the UPN program, it struck me as odd that these three people, who are  lost in the woods and in what appears to be grave danger, had the presence  of mind to film and videotape everything.  Even combat photographers will  stop filming if they are in mortal danger.  When they went into the house  at the end, a camera would have been the last thing I would have  brought.The movie spent too much time showing the three  &quot;students&quot; walking around in the woods and screaming the f-word  more times than a gangsta rap CD.  I was tempted to fast-forward through  most of it.The ending (or lack of one) left a lot to be desired.  I have  one theory.  It was Josh.  The Blair Witch possessed Josh, made him call  Mike and Heather into the house, and he did them in.  What he did with them  and what happened to him is another matter.In all, it was a good  premise, but could have been better written and produced.  Worth seeing  once, just to see what the hype was all about.",Curse of the Blair Witch VHS

106839,"Jet Li and Chris Rock are the reasons to watch this one -- Li because it's about time Martin Riggs gets his behind whipped by a truly formidable villain (the weakest point of all the Lethal Weapon movies -- Gary  Busey!?), and Rock because Joe Pesci was becoming much more of a  multi-million-dollar liability in the series than an asset.  Pesci's brand  of humour can work sometimes, but the character was so thinly written from  the get-go that they should have just dispensed with him.The scripting  is preposterous -- the flame-thrower-wielding maniac in the beginning had  nothing to do with the rest of the movie; the dialoguing is like excuse  after excuse for jokes, most of them bordering on the offensive; Riggs'  character is rendered absolutely despicable.  So it's up to Rene Russo and  Danny Glover to put some humanity into the story and they succeed well.  Li, also, finds that subtle place in his character that makes him a much  more well rounded villain (eg. his love for his brother) than those  amphibian, stereotypical South Africans in Lethal Weapon 2.I must admit,  I'm annoyed at the fact that Chinese characters are STILL inexorably tied  to kung fu.  Even after the John Woo revolution, the Chinese character in a  mostly American cast is still pitted into the chop-socky category.  That  said, Richard Donner's approach to the martial-arts sequences is  superlative; by avoiding the badly conceived, rhythmically inept  slow-motions, posing, unnecessary montages and ultra-close shots of most  Chinese martial-arts movies, Donner achieves a kineticism that was  breathtaking when seen on a big screen.  I saw this movie twice at the  theater just for the action sequences and trust me, this is one definite  case where video can't measure up.  Li's extremely mobile actions are  awesome.So that means the car chases, burning houses and gunfights pale  all the way in comparison.  As much money was thrown into that car crashing  through the building, ten seconds of Wah Sang Ku pounding both Riggs and  Murtaugh into submission completely override the big spectacles.  And when  Riggs finally defeats Wah, it's great resolution for a good human conflict.",N/A

They spend the entire movie trying to cover  up her death and play it off as a murder. Unfortunately, the school geek,  Fern, has seen the body and knows who really killed Liz. So Courtney ( Rose  McGowan ) makes a deal with Fern that she can't refuse: If Fern keeps her  trap shut, then Courtney will make her popular. ( Fern changes her name to  Violett after becoming popular )If only they would have stuck to that  basic plotline, then the story would have been more solid..The movie had  a lot of holes and loose ends left, and just some downright ridiculous  parts, for example: when Fern/Vilett is &quot;dancing&quot; on the hood of  her brand new red convertible while surrounded by a gawking crowd... need I  say more? And the cheesy &quot; You're never going to get away with  this..&quot; lines just need to go. I felt like I was watching a bitchy  scooby doo flick at times..BUT... the movie has its redeeming  qualities.For instance, I personally think that Rose McGowan plays her  character Courtney beautifully. ( If you could call it that.. ). I always  admire someone who can really pull of playing a bad guy in a flick, and she  really can.  Of course, as the movie progresses, her character does get a  little hokey.The supporting characters were good, but they really didn't  help the plotline all that much.But bringing Marilyn Manson into the  film, who can be seen here without all of the gruesome stage makeup, was  really a neat twist, seeing as he and McGowan were or still are dating. I'm  not really a Manson fan myself, but I wasn't expecting to see him in a  movie, even if his girlfriend was in it.If you like Quentin Tarantino  style movies, then you would like this one, because it obviously is one.  The costumes are good, and the movie is definately original in some  aspects.But.. if you are the kind of person who doesn't really get into  the deeper meaning of movies and who likes to be able to understand what  you are watching, then Jawbreaker is definately not for you.

A film  not so much about the whole philosophical superstructure of the world  order, but rather a film that drops you into the real lives of real  characters.

Such is the fatal flaw of The Truman Show, an ambitious, visually stunning, intellectually advanced film that restores faith in major-studio product.I've heard both gushing adoration and  invective-based indictment of this film, so I wished to make a clear-headed  assessment.  I loved the film but very much disliked the star that plays  the central character of this character-based science-fiction allegory.I  am well aware that Carrey was probably the reason that an  anti-establishment piece like this got greenlit.  Unfortunately, he was  wrong for the role.  The masterstroke thematic and narrative argument of  this film is that a genuine, everyday person can be the emotional salvation  of millions of robotic, brainwashed people around the world.  By casting  Carrey, who has not as single genuine bone in his whole acting technique,  Peter Weir compromised Truman's humanity, upon which hangs his whole  film.That aside, The Truman Show is a film of stunning craft -- from the  Dagwitz/Glass score to Peter Biziou's amazing photography; from the  flawless production design to Andrew Niccol's top-notch script; and the  supporting players, led by a flaky Laura Linney (showing much comic  ability) and the low-key, infallible Ed Harris.  A brilliant touch casting  Harris as a godhead -- when the facade of the God is ripped down, Harris'  crushed reaction is brilliant.From a purely aesthetic viewpoint  (film-industry practices aside), this film could've benefitted from a  non-name star.

Best to watch it with all the lights off and during a thunderstorm, hehe.This movie is my absolute favorite scary movie.It's one that  really WILL give you nightmares!!There seems to be very very few,if any,  movies that are as scary as this one.(Too bad) In fact, I wish directors  and writers would take a clue and give us more movies such as this one.The scariest scenes in this movie are from the seance and  afterward,  when George C. Scott's listening to the taped session... and the SCARIEST  SCENE FOR ME TO WATCH... is when the steadycam fluidly races up the stairs  and up to the attic to where the boy died. W-O-W. That scene to this day,  just CHILLS ME TO THE BONE!!!!NOT A MOVIE FOR THE YOUNG OR  EASILY-FRIGHTENED.For all scary-movie lovers BUY THIS MOVIE YOU'LL  NEVER REGRET IT!",The Changeling
496583,"The Hanoi Hilton angered a lot of reviewers upon its 1987 release.  The New Republic launched its exceptionally vicious review of the film by calling it &quot;filth.&quot;  Other reviewers howled in protest by calling  the film &quot;one-sided,&quot; &quot;virulent,&quot; and so forth.Such  reviews only confirm James Bowman's point about the idiotic film Kids,  namely that the movie reviewing community consists of the most gullible  people in the world, people who would never think to challenge the  assumptions they want to see confirmed in the movies they review.It  confirms this point because what the denunciations of The Hanoi Hilton  really reflect is the film's commitment to truth.The film is about Hoa  Lo prison, one of the most brutal POW prisons in history.  North Vietnam  not only tortured and killed prisoners, it used them as propaganda tools,  and enlisted the aid of Westerners to spread disinformation about Hanoi and  its war aims.The film captures such disinformation actions in two  crucial scenes; early on, an Australian TV journalist (based on the real  life journalist Wilfred Burchette, who aided Communist forces all over the  world and participated in the torture of American pilots in both Korea and  Vietnam) openly in league with the Communists does a piece on a prisoner  who steadfastly refuses to go along with the colossal fraud being permeated  about Communist benevolence.  The Aussie gripes at the prison commandant  (Aki Akeong) about the POW's uncooperative attitude.Later, an American  film actress and her husband (based on Jane Fonda and Tom Hayden) greet the  POWs and ask them to sign an apology &quot;to the women and children you  bombed.&quot;  Of course they did no such thing, and tell her off on  it.Nonetheless she wins the release of a few prisoners, much to the  contempt of almost all of them.  This is one of the film's major themes;  one goes, we all go, as is repeatedly told by the POWs to the prison  commandant.Eventually the POWs are released upon the signing of the  Paris Peace Accords, and celebrate having outlasted the enemy as they take  off for freedom.The film's superb cast, tremendous attention to detail  (the sets were built through extensive consultatition with men who were  imprisoned in Hoa Lo), and Lionel Chetwynd's flawless direction make for a  chilling story.",Hanoi Hilton VHS

518530,"This is a movie unlike any I have ever seen, and a story unlike any I've ever heard of.  The direction, writing, acting, shooting, and music are all brilliant.  It's a shame that the violence (I admit I looked away once) and  the rather extreme and original plot turned so many people off.  Edward  Norton is amazing--he is one of the best (if not the best) actors of his  generation.  Brad Pitt also turns in a great performance, certainly proving  he is a consumate actor and not simply nice to look at.  Helena Bonham  Carter is wonderfully trashy, quite a switch from the beautiful women of  period films she's known for playing.  I think the thing that struck me  most about this film, though (other than Norton, as I haven't seen any of  his other movies yet) was the way it was shot.  Did anyone else notice  Tyler (Pitt) popping up on screen every once in a while for split-seconds  before he actually showed up as a character?  So brace yourself if you  need to and check out this fabulous movie.  Violent, yes, but also (and  moreso) intelligent, creative, and actually often hilarious.",N/A
233730,"Well, my major reason for buying this film is because I'm a big Rolling Stones fan and the plot seemed intriguing. When I first watched the first half of it, dealing with all those gangsters, I remember being really bored  and thinking &quot;I thought Mick Jagger was suppose to be in this  movie&quot; BUT after watching it a second time I realized both parts tie  together. The second half of the movie is the most interesting, and no, not  just because of Mick Jagger. It deals with Turner trying to warp and change  Chas' personality, and that is why Chas kills Turner in the end, for  intruding on his mind and personality. You have to watch it a few times to  really understand it though. Turner sees himself in Chas, at least who he  was when he was younger, before he lost his &quot;demon.&quot; Its a really  great movie and one of the only movies that Jagger is in that shows how  good he can act. James Fox is also a great actor and its too bad he went  crazy afterwards.",N/A

IG has a powerful message about peace and  friendship.  The  animation is great, too.

88554,"For those who know Marlon Brando only from his recent fiascos, such as The Island Of Dr. Moreau, it might be hard to believe that not only was he the greatest actor of his generation, but his acting set the standard and style  for many of his contemporaries and most of those who followed over the next  10-20 years.  Take a look at Streetcar (and, while you're at it, his Terry  Malloy in On The Waterfront), and there can be no question of his  greatness.  But what is most amazing is that, while this is one of the  greatest performances in the history of cinema, it does not overshadow the  other three leading performances.  In fact, Vivien Leigh's Blanche du Bois  is also arguably one of the greatest performances ever captured on screen,  and Karl Malden and Kim Stanely are just as perfect in their supporting  roles.  Elia Kazan was always an actor's director, and this was never more  apparent than in this film. Even the censors could not dilute the power of  Tennessee Williams' play (as they would a few years later with the  adaptation of Cat On A Hot Tin Roof), but it will always be the acting that  will keep the viewer mezmerized.",A Streetcar Named Desire

Anyway, I totally blown away by what I thought would be a standard action flick.  Of  course its' been done before, but the formula works, and along with superb  acting from Mr. Clooney and Ms. Kidman, a good director [Mimi Leder,  director of such films as Deep Impact], great special effects, and an  outstanding musical composition [from Hans Zimmer, if the music sounds  familiar its because he also worked on Crimson Tide], this is definitely a  must-see!",N/A
405959,"Although Julie Andrews was a better singer, Audrey Hepburn was a far much better actress with a wide range of acting abilities.  Mrs. Hepburn was very funny as well as dramatic.  Nobody could have portrayed the feelings  and expressions of Eliza Doolitle with such a heart-felt emotion and  honesty from beggining to end.  Only a flower girl as portrayed by Mrs.  Hepburn could have been the cause for Professor Higgins, a recalcitrant  bachelor, to say &quot;...I have grown accustomed to her...&quot; at the  possibility of a life without her.My Fair Lady is one of the best  movies ever made. It is better than West Side Story, and Sound of Music  because of its extraordinary and unique storyline.  It is a superb movie  that happens to be a musical.  Besides its beautiful music, lyrics, actors,  costumes, period sets, and any other categories of production, the viewer  is captivated because of the most exquisite romantic comedy story ever  written, with its intricate and witty dialogue.  Only after several viewing  one may capture the delicacies and nuances of the story and its characters.  Every single line is as valuable as any other, and it has a meaning as  profound as any other, and they are so engaging that once the movie is over  one would not believe that 3 hours has elapsed.  Stage musicals brought  into the silver screen should not be judged with an emphasis on their music  and vocal abilities, but rather on their storylines, and the messages thus  portayed.I definitely recommend the reading of both reviews by James  Berardinelli and Roger Ebert from the movie database here at amazon.  They  have it right on the money and so well written.Here is a quote from  James Berardinelli:  &quot;Consider this possibility: a romantic comedy  with no nudity, no sex, and no kissing.  In fact, there aren't even any  declarations of love.  The closest the female character comes to admitting  her feelings is saying that she could have danced all night with the man;  the closest he gets is remarking that he is grown accustomed to her face.  Could such a project lift off the pad in today's cliamte?One would be  very cynical if he or she has not seen the movie before, as it happened to  me until I saw it in this restored DVD.",N/A

27421,"PYGMALION (the play and the movie) has in recent years been almost entirely overshadowed by MY FAIR LADY (the musical play and the movie musical).  To be sure, MY FAIR LADY is a superlative work, but so is this  adaptation of G.B. Shaw's play. Indeed, Lerner and Leowe knew a good thing  when they saw it; they actually based MY FAIR LADY on this screenplay  rather than the original play. A magnificent cast headed by Wendy Hiller  and Leslie Howard find all the vibrancy in Shaw's prose.  Interestingly,  Shaw fully approved of Hiller (whom he'd seen play Eliza on stage), but  originally wanted Charles Laughton to play Higgins.  Nevertheless, Howard  is excellent as the brilliant, infuriating phonetics professor.PYGMALION is  an absolute delight, but Shavian purists may well grumble at the  film'sending, which is totally different from the play's (and was also used  in MY FAIR LADY).  How producer Gabriel Pascal convinced Shaw to go along  with that is anyone's guess!",N/A

95390,"Dudley Moore showed us what he can do when given a good script and strong support. With Julie Andrews as his on-again off-again love interest, Moore creates a believable, if not entirely sympathetic, character: George  Webber. George is unsure of himself - after all, turning 42 does do  something to a man's self-esteem; in his case he becomes obsessed with  Jenny (Bo Derek), a fleeting vision of perfection (11 on a scale of 1 to  10). Giving way to his baser impulses George (unwittingly) becomes sexually  entangled with Derek, but realises that lust is a castle of sand.Blake  Edwards draws George as a rather shallow individual, prone to voyeurism and  egocentricity -  but who, in his quest for perfection, gives the viewer a  hint of our own moral eccentricities. The writing is especially strong in  the film's second half as George agonises over his lack of direction and  moral compass. His rebuke of Jenny - decrying her amorality after their  illicit consummation - is the film's highlight; stinging, yet  poignant.Dudley Moore, for once, played a seriocomic figure with  maturity and humanity, traits not evident in subsequent films.",N/A

121411,"This film has two of Hollywood's biggest stars - Eastwood and Costner - both of whom give great performances. But it's the young actor who plays the kidnapped boy who steals the show. This drama is set in Texas, early  November 1963 - shortly before JFK's fateful visit to Dallas. An escaped  convict (Costner) kidnaps a boy and is on the run from the law (Eastwood)  and each of their lives are changed forever. The film is especially  touching whenever it focuses on the growing relationship between the  convict &amp; boy - Costner's portrayal of the tough escapee with a kind  heart is great and the boy is so natural and likeable. Under Eastwood's  direction the film is controlled and avoids the pitfall of melodrama. The  ending is tragic yet inevitable. I think this is one of Costner's best  performances and was surprised when the film seemed to be overlooked by the  media. I loved the whole feel of the movie and cared about the characters -  even some of the minor ones like the sharecropper family. I highly  recommend this film.",N/A

As attractive or  atriculate as the traveler maybe, you can sense a gnawing quality of  shiftlessness and aimlessness. This person doesn't really know where he or  she is going.

So it was  with &quot;Temptress Moon&quot;.&quot;Temptress Moon&quot; has a lot of  beautiful touches but essentially lacks a story. So much of this movie  should have worked and just didn't. The premise of the young man, Zhong  Liang escaping from his incestuous sister only to become a gigalo in  Shanghai was fascinating. Unfortunately the story lost steam when Zhong  Liang returned home to seduce his childhood acquaintance played by a  mature, robust Gong Li. Somehow it doesn't add up when the thirty something  year old Gong Li is referred to as &quot;Gu Niang&quot; (young girl).

Constance Towers, in a &quot; &agrave; la Gena Rowlands &quot; role, gives a performance you won't forget easily. A great thanks then to  Criterion which allows us to rediscover this wonderful movie.Samuel  Fuller, from his 1940 debut in Hollywood until his last movies in France,  deserves to be considered as one of the great american directors of the  last fifty years. He mainly visited the western, war movies and film noir  genres and gave us such masterpieces as FORTY GUNS, SHOCK CORRIDOR and  UNDERWORLD, U.S.A. With no big stars but with a style of its own. Raw,  violent and provocative, for the eyes and also for the intellect.THE  NAKED KISS is a movie destined to shock the audience. An emotionally  ultra-violent first scene prepares us to a journey through Cinderella Land  and the Garden of Evil. Samuel Fuller won't let anybody unharm. The  Charming Prince, the Hooker with a heart big as the world, the Cop blas&eacute; :  everybody will suffer in front of Fuller's camera.It's the third time I  watch THE NAKED KISS, the first time on DVD, and I like it even more now.

It should only be seen in theaters, and those that can run it in cinerama (three projectors).  Cold and dispassionate,  ""2001"" was far ahead of its time, and has a similar affect on people today  as it did when it was first released.  People love this movie, and people  hate this movie.  So do the professional critics.  Based on Arthur C.  Clarke's 1950 short story ""The Sentinel"", Clarke and Kubrick spent two  years expanding this story into a screenplay.  BTW, Clarke's novel is based  upon that screenplay.  Original set for a 1966 release, ""2001"" finally came  to the big screen in 1968.  The story is about first contact, and is unlike  anything that came before or since.  Scientifically accurate and sparse on  dialogue, this movie is a visual treat, and still holds up rather well  today (31 years after its initial release).  Between 1 and 10, ""2001"" gets  a solid 9.  I will sorely miss Stanley Kubrick and the genius of his  creations.",N/A
