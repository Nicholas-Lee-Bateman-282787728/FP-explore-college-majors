364313,"I first saw this glittering fantasy tale on the silver screen with my family when I was a young teenager. I truly love the mystic world full of such whimsical creatures such as multi-faced courtiers, a gigantic swamp  tortoise, a rock-eating giant, an eldery elfin couple, and so on forth.  Especially the flying white dragon that greatly resembles a big, friendly  puppy dog! In this film, a brave young boy being chased by school bullies  and having to put up with an indifferent dad secretly smuggles a  unusual-looking book out of an musty old bookstore. Then he hides in a  school closet to read all about &quot;himself&quot; as the hero setting out  on a great quest to save the dying world from the unseen evil. Imagine a  young child becoming quite enthralled by a real storybook, especially the  part where he cries over the death of the hero's horse deep in the depths  of a treacherous swampland. And there are also frightening parts  in this  imaginative yarn as well, yet it is still quite a welcome change for young  people being raised in the age of really gross and scary movies like  &quot;The Gremlins&quot; and &quot;The Blade Runner&quot;. However, the sad  thing about &quot;The Neverending Story&quot; is that it is eventually  reduced to direct-to-video kiddie fodder those days.",The NeverEnding Story VHS
81609,"From the day he was born, Simon Birch was different. No bigger than a baby bird, doctors predicted he would never last the night. But he did. Then they said he would never last a week. But he did. Eventually, Simon grew into a little boy, fortified by the staunch belief that God had made him small for a reason, that God not only had a special plan for him but that he was going to be a hero. His story is related by a narrator, Simon's best friend as a child, now grown-up. We only see him twice - at the beginning and at the end - but it's this character, played with incredibly sensitivity by Jim Carrey (who curiously gets no screen credit) that bookends the narrative. Veteran screenwriter and now first-time director Mark Steven Johnson has created a cinematic fable, suggested by John Irving's ""A Prayer for Owen Meany."" Since the story begins in a graveyard in Gravestown, Maine, by the tombstone of ""Simon Birch,"" we know that the pivotal character died at the age of 12, so the only dramatic tension revolves around when, where, and how this tragedy occurred. The problem with the structure of the film is that it's so obviously melodramatic and manipulative. In the title role, Ian Michael Smith, who is afflicted with a rare enzyme disorder, Morquio Syndrome, compensates for his ""vertical challenge"" with a truly magical display of talent. And Joseph Mazzello delivers a truly remarkable performance as Simon's best friend (the young Jim Carrey) whose single mother, played by Ashley Judd, refuses to reveal the name of his father, thus providing the curious boys with an ongoing mystery. Oliver Platt and David Straithairn provide stalwart support",N/A
258376,"I first saw ""The Day After"" in its entirety in 1989. The film is a ""horror"" story about nuclear war, which concentrates on areas around Kansas City. Jason Robards plays a doctor. He is one of the survivors who makes his way back to the hospital, which is being swamped with the injured and the sick.The scenes of the holocaust are quite spectacular (for their time) and this is the highlight of the film. After that the film seems to drag. Survivors wandering around hopelessly, getting sick and dying. I know this is what would happen in reality but I don't think the film needed to go on for as long as it did. It managed to be a disturbing story until I saw the British film ""Threads"", which was far more realistic and far less sentimental.When you analyze ""The Day After"" you start to wonder how realistic it really is. If nuclear war really happened, it's highly unlikely that a hospital would be able to help anyone. (That was put across quite graphically in ""Threads"".) Is a car really a safe place to hide from a nuclear explosion? If my memory serves me correctly, Jason Robards wasn't even scratched! All the other people around him were dead.If you want to see the ""real"" consequences of nuclear war, see ""Threads"". (If you can find it.) It was directed by Mick Jackson, better known for his film ""Volcano"".",N/A

It is the funniest, wackiest Muppet movie since The Great Muppet Caper.Knowing parodies of ID4, Close Encounters of the Third Kind and The  X-Files added extra chuckles.The only flaw is that they don't sing their  own songs like they did in previous movies, but you can't have everything.  If you are a Muppet fan, you will enjoy this movie (unless you are  expecting a feature length version of Pigs in Space).",N/A
469497,"It's amazing how BWP has actually split people evenly into the pro/&quot;I love it&quot; to the con/&quot;What the hell is this?&quot; crowds.  I for one loved this film for it's &quot;chill&quot; factor.  I've been watching horror films (Hammer, etc.) and reading horror books and comics (King,  Barker, etc) since I can remember, and I still think that BWP is by far the  scariest piece of fiction ever made largely due to it's realism and the way  it prompts viewers to &quot;visualize&quot; the implied terror in Heather  and crew's film.For maximum effect (especially for those who  &quot;just didn't get it&quot; including a number of my friends with whom I  have been heartily debating this for quite some time now), I'd suggest  buying this DVD (it's really worth it especially given the fact that it's  loaded with special features such as the  fake documentary et al coupled  with its low price relative to higher priced DVDs whose only so-called  special features are interactive menus - as  well as one or two theatrical trailers) and watching  &quot;Curse of the Blair Witch&quot; first before viewing the feature film.  Then, as a recap, try getting a copy of the BWP Dossier which more or less  goes a step further in providing an epilogue of sorts to the film with a  post-investigation &quot;seance&quot; of sorts conducted by Buck Buchanan  and party at the site (Rustin Parr's house), with spine-tingling results!  At best, you'd really, really get scared and at worst, you'd probably find  the whole thing still unintelligible but still you can't deny and keep from  being impressed at the overall effort and creativity exhibited by the maker  of BWP in propagating the whole mythology.",Curse of the Blair Witch VHS

That's why when you come across a REALLY funny movie....you  must TELL PEOPLE!  If you like witty, realistic, sarcastic dialogue  delivered by a perfact cast this is the movie to buy.

507882,"It's an interesting exercise in documentary film-making, but the sources are so dubious, you have to question Broomfield's judgment in relying solely on them. The film is missing something -- it never ties it all  together or pushes its points through to their conclusions.Tom Grant's  conspiracy theory is refuted only from one angle, but never fully explored.  Broomfield seemed to have worked hard to get the film made, but doesn't  seem to have done enough actual reporting. Surely he could have dug up  better people to ask about K &amp; C.And as an earlier review has said,  the film can't make up its mind about what direction to go in.For those  of you seeking proof of a Courtney-headed conspiracy, it's not here,  although the documentary does make a compelling case that Courtney is  manipulative and sometimes vicious.For me, the highlight of the film  came near the end when Broomfield essentially hijacks an ACLU dinner at  which Courtney was the keynote speaker. As Broomfield begins to ask a  question of Courtney, the head of the ACLU shouts &quot;Get off the  [expletive] stage!&quot; Great irony.So, unless you're a big fan of  Broomfield, Kurt, Courtney, or the Mentors, you should rent this, but not  buy it. IMO, it's not worth watching twice.",N/A
213767,"Unlike the glossy and melodramatic ""The Day After"", ""Testament"" is a low-budget PBS film that will keep you riveted to your seats.  It is about the aftermath of global war as seen from the eyes of a small town, and in  particular, one close-knit family.  Be forwarned, this movie is powerful  and unrelenting.  As the movie moves forward, it becomes more and more  depressing, and by the time the credits roll up, the viewer is spent.As  stated by the other reviewers, Jane Alexander's performance is nothing  short of magnificent, and I've never seen anything to match it.  (If memory  serves me, I believe Kevin Costner has a small part in the film--although I  am far from certain about this).  Although you won't have any warm fuzzy  feelings after you turn off the VCR, this is a film that shouldn't be  missed.  Between 1 and 10, ""Testament"" gets a solid 9.",Testament VHS

293441,"The first time I saw &quot;Persona&quot; as an eager college student many years ago, my reaction was &quot;huh?&quot; I have seen the film several dozen more times since then, and much of the mystery remains, revealing  another dimension with each viewing. Since Bergman's retirement and  subsequent autobiographical writings, John Lahr speculates that this film  is clearly about the two sides of Bergman's mother--and he makes a  convincing case.  Someone else here has posted that the film is really a  disection of schitzophrenia. I have made the argument in the past that the  movie is about...the movies.  The working title was  &quot;Cinematography,&quot; and Bergman has expressed this duality about  the role of the artist/filmmaker in the past and the trickery inherent in  the process of making and watching films. My point is that all the  above--and more--is true. Critic John Simon has stated that &quot;'Persona'  is to film what 'Ullyses' is to the novel.&quot; Yep...at least.",Persona VHS

3672,"I can't express with what anticipation I look forward to this dramatization of C. S. Forester's superb Hornblower novels or the equally crushing disappointment with which I viewed the result.  Once again, a  masterpiece of literature has been destroyed by a screen dramatists attempt  to &quot;improve&quot; it.  Again and again, plots, incidents and  characters have been altered from those set forth in Forester's novel  &quot;Mr. Midshipman Hornblower&quot; and in every instance the  screenwriter's decision has cheapened or weakened the end product.  Worst  of all have been the attempts at &quot;political correctness.&quot;  I can  never remember Hornblower being portrayed as being so buddy-buddy with the  common seaman, Forester (accurately) depicted the distant if respectful  relationship between the two seafaring classes.  And Hornblower never never  NEVER expressed any sympathy for the French Revolution!  The scene where  the French villagers sing the Marseillese while their compatriots are  executed never appeared in the novel and was of course blatantly stolen  from &quot;Casablanca.&quot;  (I might add that in my opinion that cretins  who burn works of art for firewood and use rare books to prop up table legs  deserve anything they get!)

Her outer physical beauty does not alter the fact that deep inside, her character is a ruthless, evil, cold  blooded killer. It just goes to show that you can't judge a person by their  physical appearance.

However, I was pleasantly surprised and  charmed by this wonderful and hilarious adaptation of the Christmas classic  by Dickens.  My two favorite characters, Gonzo and Rizzo, help keep the  audience's interest by mixing classic narration with comic slapstick. Those  two have the best chemistry in the film!  Michael Caine is excellent as the  embittered Scrooge, and I love the songs and the other Muppet creatures.  Although I cannot help but watch it with a sad heart, I know that somewhere  Henson is looking down on this Christmas Carol and smiling proudly.",N/A

388026,"The film could have (and should have) been better.  Especially since it was written by Ron Moore and Brannon Bragga who wrote the far-superior follow-up &quot;First Contact&quot; 2 years later.The films good  points: excellent special effects, fine acting, and an engaging musical  score (especially for Dennis McCarthy, a television composer).  I  especially enjoyed seeing the Enterprise crashing into the planet's  surface-something I have always wanted to see in a &quot;Star Trek&quot;  film (I was also pleased to see that cruise ship trashed).  I also enjoyed  Picard's speech at the end concering our own mortality.The negative  points: as was the case with &quot;The Next Generation&quot; TV show (and  now with &quot;Voyager&quot; and &quot;Insurrection&quot;) this film  utilized a great deal of techno-babble.  The subplot involving Data's  emotion chip was pointless but I was strongly  amused with his profane  reaction to the Enterprise being in danger.Regarding Kirk, I can't  help but feel as if the film would have been more dramatic if Kirk's  idealized life in the Nexus had involved a life with his son David whom he  never really knew until shortly before his untimely death in  &quot;ST3&quot;.  Imagine Picard trying to pull Kirk away from that.I  was also disappointed with the fact that Kirk didn't interact with other  &quot;Next Generation&quot; members other than Picard. Finally Kirk's death  (no surprise-everyone knew about it long before the scene was even filmed)  just wasn't dramatic enough. Despite all of the films flaws, the film was  enjoyable-heck, it was still better than &quot;Final Frontier&quot; and  &quot;Motion Picture&quot;.",Star Trek Generations VHS

103773,"&quot;L.A. Confidential&quot; possesses many of the good qualities that the great 40's film noirs displayed, but the filmmakers' desire to resort to fashionable 90's movie trends unfortunately riddle their piece with  fatal flaws. First the good--1.) The visual style of the film: In an age  where many movies look like nothing so much as feature length trailers,  (&quot;Usual Suspects,&quot; &quot;The Negotiator,&quot; MOST others)  &quot;L.A. Confidential&quot; was refreshingly filmed with truer visual  integrity. Also aiding is Dante Spinetti's exquisite color cinematography.  2.) The approach to character portrayal: This is one of the few films you  will see nowadays in which the performances are fully worked out, and not  sold on cute little epigrams, and other such stupid cop-out devices. 3.)  Guy Pearce: Among the performances in &quot;L.A. Confidential,&quot; his  impressed me the most, successfully avoiding most of the cliched  personalities of this criminally weak movie age. His effort goes further in  establishing him as a multi-dimensional character than the script does. 4.)  The prescence of intelligence in the script: Such a hard commodity to come  by anymore, scriptwriters Curtis Hanson and Brian Helgeland seemed to be  interested in doing more than just selling the story with star names, big  budget, and promotion. Now for the unfortunate bad--1.) The body count:  This offends on several points. A, not only does the ludicrously enormous  body count of about two dozen not fit the time period of the story, but no  realistic reaction of horror and outcry from government or public towards  the mass butchery ever comes up, making it seem not out of the ordinary for  the 1950's, seriously undermining its persuasiveness; B, the widespread  killing does not fit the spirit of film noir, which always had discreet and  realistic body counts (&quot;Maltese Falcon,&quot; 3; &quot;Big  Sleep,&quot; 5; &quot;Chinatown,&quot; 4; etc.); and usually the deaths  occured offscreen in order to enhance the plot surprises. C, the realism of  showing the cop or detective as more a victim of violence than a cause of  it is jettisoned. And this is because of D, the film's tragic decision to  resort to fashionable 90's gratuitous bloodshed and sadism as its  motivation for excitement, completely going against the classic film noir's  practice of hinging it on character intereaction and plot developments. 2.)  Attempts to portray the characters as multi-dimensional are emetic,  especially in trying to arouse sympathy for Bud White and his ultra-violent  behavior with a sob story of his unhappy childhood which is way out of step  with the rest of the film. The classic film noirs never hazarded to sell  such melodramatic excrescences. 3.) The refusal to break from tiresome 90's  cliches such as: A, the typical big shoot-out finale. Not only does this  again stray from the spirit of film noir, but the mindset of having to  provide blood-spurting fireworks in an attempt to make sure that the  audience leaves the theater satisfied is a pure cop out on the part of  filmmakers everywhere (I mean, who couldn't have guessed it was coming?).  Even &quot;Chinatown,&quot; which appeared in an era in which climactic  gory showdown were fast becoming popular, did not marr its integrity with  such an obvious device. B, the stereotypical 90's portrayal of the  &quot;hero's&quot; (Ed Exley) method of taking charge. Let's see, poor  repressed fellow tries to adhere to proper procedure while investigating,  can't get anywhere, so--casting off his repressive principles--he becomes  nastier than criminals, who then tell him what he wants to know, leading to  solved crime. What ever happened to the uncompromising Marlowe or Spade,  who ferreted out the information with cunning and shrewdness?  4.) Dialogue  is rife with four-letter words, most gratuitously inserted to establish its  &quot;adult&quot; status. 5.) The script is too long, the 2 hr. and 15 min.  running time seeming to have become the standard for films in this flabby  cinematic age. 6.) The outright celebration of corruption and violence:  Since not even the extortionist &quot;hero&quot; is sympathetic; and since  most of the killings are shown in such a graphic and jazzed-up way, this  film is an incitement and unadulterated endorsement of domestic terrorism.  7.) And most fatal, the fact that the entire outcome of the plot hinges on  an alarmingly weak thread, featuring a redundant character: As it finally  turns out, the only way that Ed Exley and Bud White can end their bitter  rivalry and unite to solve the crime is completely dependant on a scene  where Exley visits the hooker, Lynn Bracken--whose only purpose in this  film is to serve as the object for whom the two lock horns over--who then  proceeds to step WAY out of character, and suddenly rips her clothes off of  and they have sex together. This critically lame thread seems concocted out  of pure desperation by the filmmakers; for if Exley doesn't do this, the  entire film crashes in flames. They don't create the meaty roles for women  in the film noir thriller these days like they once did for Mary Astor, Ava  Gardner, Gene Tierney, Lauren Bacall, Faye Dunaway, and others. 8.)  Finally, while not a flaw, the acting has been generally overrated. Kim  Basinger's portrayal of a character that proves to be totally unnecessary  to the film--outside of her physical body, that is--is not exactly awful,  but is far from good. Let's face it, she walked away with an Academy  &quot;compensation&quot; prize for &quot;L.A. Confidential&quot;; which,  alas, could not displace &quot;Titanic&quot; in the minds of the  popularity-conscious voters for most every major category. Kevin Spacey's  performance was intelligent, but nothing really beyond what any decently  good actor that was interested could do. Any nit-wit could have been cast  in the unpersuasive role that Russell Crowe filled. So, in conclusion,  there was a great film in there somewhere, but, sadly, the makers of  &quot;L.A. Confidential&quot; failed to rise to the task of creating a  superior example of film noir--the sort that we have not seen since  &quot;Chinatown&quot;.",N/A

In addition to the standard director's/actors commentary audio tracks,  there is also a complete side of the disc with previously unreleased  footage.

409715,"Well done to Anchor Bay for this latest release that presents the Zombie Masters' classic on a single side of a DVD (though more would have been nice!!).  The film has never looked or sounded better.  A minor gripe - in  the early SWOT team raid, skin colours did tend to merge with the green of  the tear gas, making even the police occasionally look like zombies!Over  hear in England, I was first introduced to this ground breaking horror  movie as Zombies: Dawn of the Dead - and therefore saw the Dario Argento  (slightly shorter) cut.  Recently though, the wonderful BBC broadcast the  'US Cinema cut' - apparently unmolested.  This edition of the DVD also  purports to be the US Cinema cut but I did notice some differences -  noteably, the clear-up scene in the basement of the 'projects' building and  the biker attack on the mall.  The BBC cut showed our hero popping bullets  through the sheet covered heads of several bodies in the basement, then  lots of sniper rifle close ups of heads going pop in the biker attack.  These 'gory' extras seemed missing on the DVD.  Does anybody know the score  on these differences??Another gripe is with the extras on this disk -  it's good to see the Dario Argento 'talking' scenes, but what about the  extra gore scenes they actually mention in the on screen text??  The  slapstick gore is what makes this movie stand out and extras on this front  are surely what the majority want to see?  The mall advert is intesting for  about as long as it's duration (a minute) and there's no supplemental  behind the scenes footage.  What about an interview with the filmaker?  Or  one with Argento on why the differences for Europe?  And who hasn't  wondered 'where are they now?' about their favourite cast member - ideal  fodder for an anniversary extra!?!This is a must have DVD for any fan  but it would've been nice if Anchor went to the depths that Criterion do  for some of their releases.",Dawn of the Dead VHS

189625,"This is one of the great existential movies of all time.  I like to compare it with Herzog's ""Aguirre Wrath of God"".  On one hand, the source of courage is faith; on the other, the source of courage is hubris and greed. I also like to compare Black Robe with Dreyer's masterpiece, The Passion of Joan of Arc, because in the end, through their faith, the protagonists are transfigured.Black Robe and Aguirre put me in awe, not only at the scenery, but at men like the Jesuit priest-martyrs of North America and the conquistadors of South America, plunging into the infinite green voids, never to return.

284172,"This is a very special film, in that it was the only one to be directed by Charles Laughton. Very Germanic in it's creepy photography, the movie has much symbolism and it very well acted. I can see why it wasn't a success in 1955, it being ahead of its time.  It plays like a fairy tale and a thriller all at once. I liked the old uncle played by James Gleason, Evelyn Varden is an amusing pain as Icey Spoon and Mitchum is genuine and convincing as the psychotic 'preacher'. I wasn't crazy about the artificial set where Ruby goes to find love. I felt Lillian Gish gave the best performance in the film.Creepy is the scene where the children's mother (Shelley Winters) is shown beneath the water, drowned by Mitchum. My favorite part is where the kids are sleeping in the hayloft and John wakes up in the wee hours and sees Powell's sillouette riding a horse singing &quot;Leaning on the Everlasting Arms&quot; - he remarks to himself in horrific disbelief &quot;Don't he ever sleep?&quot; The music is hauntingly realized although the scene where Pearl sings a song in the rowboat with John is ridiculous - a child her age wouldn't sing such lyrics.",Night of the Hunter VHS

34547,"WHY HASN'T THIS BEEN ISSUED ON DVD? 'Swing Time' is a film which defines the poetry and grace of the screen's greatest dancing combination, Fred  Astaire and Ginger Rogers. Forget that this is mono sound, and the images  are black and white. The dancing is as modern as today; the spirit of the  film as youthful still as its stars were an extraordinary 63 years ago. The  casual insouciance of Astaire and Rogers in a scene such as the farcical  dancing lesson which turns into a dancing tour-de-force, 'Pick Yourself  Up', fills one with exuberant joy on the 50th viewing. Fred Astaire is  grace itself, with his apparent ease concealing the regime of practice and  preparation which lay behind every step. As for Ginger Rogers -- her lithe,  sensual body, her strong shoulders and willowy frame, make her a delight to  watch in this and all the staire/Rogers films. Pure sex appeal in dance!

Halloween was a thrill ride primarily because it relied on a character with motivation for  mayhem and yet not a drop of blood was spilled. Any film can scare by  flashing gruesome images, but Halloween delivered a Psychoesque approach to  film-making.I still look over my shoulder in the shower after Phycho, and  I'd think twice before babysitting alone after Halloween. H2O is a plot  based, terrifying and surprisingly believable follow up of the characters  that made this film great.If they managed not to spill any blood in it, I  would've given it 5 stars!

49783,"First a suggestion to the viewer below from Rockwall. You need to see this one again. In terms of comedy, &quot;That Old Feeling&quot; is bubbling with it !  Anyone who knows anything at all about Bette Midler, knows that  her snappy wit and peppered dialog go along with the program.  As a film  star who meets up with her writer  ex-husband after 14 years at their  daughters wedding, Bette and Dennis Farina bounce beautifully off one  another. The dialog is quick and sharp , and Bette is at her best in her  scenes sparring with Farina. Paula Marshall and Danny Nucci are good as the  younger romantic leads, and David Rasche and Gail O'Grady stand out as the  present spouses of Midler and Farina, but it is Bette, as always who steals  the show. Though the characters break all the rules of taste and family  stability, you still root for them to kiss and make up in the end. Romance  and comedy are mixed to perfection here. Carl Reiner did a fine directing  job.",N/A

It is  a voyeurs wet dream this movie is.What I enjoyed most about this film  is the dreariness of the way it was filmed, and of course the eerie music  to go along with it. Only ignorant people can't look past the sex and nudity.  It  is also a compelling tale of a loser who gets his rocks off by watching  other people's lives like he is watching a soap opera.  He does this by  installing hidden video cameras in all the rooms of the apartment  building.......creepy, very very creepy.Sharon Stone shines here, in a  very underrated thriller.

With &quot;Amadeus,&quot; we're presented with a compelling, albeit inaccurate, portrayal of the maestro's life, and  the results are beautiful!The strength in any good movie always starts  with the acting, and &quot;Amadeus&quot; is well-equipped in that catagory.  F. Murray Abraham delivers a great performance as Mozart's envious  colleague, Antonio Salieri, while Tom Hulce hands us a memorable enactment  of the title character. Added to the mix are fine efforts by the supporting  cast, rounding out the presentation.Imagery is crucial in films of this  sort, and we are not disappointed in this area; cinematography is excellent  and art direction is fabulous. The opera scenes are magnificent, making the  viewer feel as though they were present.The only qualm that I have with  this film is that it's slightly too long. Those interested in the subject  will have no problem with it, others may be somewhat tested. Nonetheless,  my above rating should read: &quot;4 1/2 stars.&quot;Don't fret over the  historical inaccuracies of this work, if you want the &quot;real&quot;  Mozart, watch a documentary.

With one eye out for scandal and the other looking it all as a joke, Bunuel's first  film (with collaboration from Dali) is a concentrated piece of sonambulist  nonesense.  Patched together by an illogical sequence of events, the movie  follows the criteria of a proper Surrealist object--disjunctions in time  and space.  (It was supposed to be the passport for both artists in to the  Parisian Surrealist circle.  And what a passport it was.  It proved to be a  veritable succes de scandal.)  But it also contains the seeds for the  future work of this auteur. Luis Bunuel went on to have a strange career,  working at MoMA at one point, a commercial director in Mexico, and finally  an internationally recognized filmmaker. Un Chien Andalou was to be the  ground zero for Bunuel.  Essential filmviewing.",N/A

In fairness, I'm  sure alot the reviews here were written by teens, and I might have liked  Never Been Kissed if I was a teen myself. But I'm in my late 20's now and  seeing the same old teen cliches is tiresome. The dialogue in this movie  was clunky, with rarely a funny sentence spoken by any of the characters.  I've always liked Drew Barrymore, her sweetness comes across as genuine,  and she was pretty likeable in this movie and fun to watch as well. But the  intended message in this movie was this, if you're born ugly you're not  worth a damn because did you notice how better-looking Drew became as the  movie progressed? This coincided with her growing popularity with the other  students. In real life, Drew isn't ugly, and neither was her outcasted  &quot;geeky&quot; friend who was supposed to be unattractive as well. Other  cliches: the young good-looking heartthrob teacher, the dumb jock, the  three inseperable shallow bimbos who get what they deserve in the end  (shocking), aren't these same three girls in every teen movie? The black  guy with nothing but bad one-liners, and of course the embarrasing final  scene where the &quot;positive message&quot; speech which is spooned down  your throat like barium before a stomach x-ray.

130252,"It's fair to compare this with &quot;Three Good Men&quot;, just another branch of service involved here, Army not Navy. (Also, in Three Good Men the incident takes place in Cuba, outside of FBI jurisdiction and what  might be termed as a hostile environment). Nonetheless, they are both about  an investigation, but 3GM ends up in the courtroom for a suspenseful  finish, while General's Daughter ends with special effects. It boils down  to a question of tatse, if you like SFX centre stage and acting on the side  this movie fills the bill. As good as I think Travolta is, and he really  isn't bad in this movie either, he delivers a cooky cutter performance. The  location or venue is interesting - an army special ops training ground  (attention has been paid to make the film realistic). Further, the film  does have its moments of suspense, but it becomes pretty clear how it will  end - early on. Travolta plays a sergeant who happens on to a murder while  investigating arms smuggling from the base. He's a sort of Rambo character  in the CID division (Criminal Investigation Dept), and his beligerant  attitude with senior officers is somewhat amusing if not realistic. He  meets the girl who is murdered, naturally likes her, finds somethings  upseting about her in his investigation, and goes gunning for the murderer  with a few &quot;Sirs&quot; thrown in to remind us of his rank!

It is like spending a good two hours  with a next door neighbour. This, the most revered of his films, takes a  simple story of an elderly couple visiting their neglectful grown-up  children, which could have been a melodrama; instead he elevates it to a  philosophical medidation on the transience of human existence and  privileges of living.

116137,"It always seems as though the same concept gets sold to a variety of Hollywood producers at about the same time &amp; a race is on to get out a product.  Last year two big rocks came to hit the Earth in two different  movies, for example.  The current big trend is Cyber-Space or alternate  reality.Three movies have been released at almost the same time about  this theme: The Thirteenth Floor, eXisTenz, and The Matrix.Matrix is,  admittedly, a lot of fun, even if it lacks the maturity of eXisTenz or the  more pure Sci/Fi attitude of Thirteenth Floor.  Matrix plays more towards  an action/adventure crowd and makes frequent use of the same type of  special effects as can be seen in those pants commercials where the kids  are dancing, then seem to freeze in mid-air.  Kind of neat, but we've seen  it before, and soon it will go the way of &quot;Morphing&quot; which T2  brought to a whole new level but isn't used too often anymore because of  the been-there, done-that attitude.Also, Keanu Reeves' final showdown  with the Computer Agent felt contrived.  He had a phone to catch, after  all, and the fight with these bad guys could have waited until the  sequel.Many have commented on the &quot;what-if&quot; our life is just a  computer program.  Kind of like what if our life is just a dream of the  fantasy and science fiction novels of not so long ago.  It isn't new, and  Matrix, rather than try to make the idea new, turns it into the starting  point for a story of a comic book hero.Most disturbing about this movie  is the scene where the heroes walk into the lobby of an office building and  shoot all of the guards.  This was overly reminiscent of the man who walked  into the lobby of the Capitol and opened fire.  I found the scene difficult  to applaud.  This is in contrast with a scene in T2 where Arnold, after  being told not to kill anyone, takes careful aim and shoots out tires and  lights rather than people.  The scene in Matrix might have played better if  the heroes were given more fanciful weapons.  Luke Skywalker had his  lightsaber, Indiana Jones had a whip.  These were pretty cool toys.  Keanu  Reeves, in the computer generated world, should have been able to come up  with something similarly fantastic.",N/A

Most, when they returned, tried to slide back quietly into film making.  Clark Gable,  for instance, made a good but fluffy film with Doris Day.  Tracy, however,  jumped back with a controversial film about race hatred that has become a  classic.

In Black Rock, he finds a trio of real baddies  in Robert Ryan, Lee Marvin and Ernest Borgnine.  The surprising scene in  the town diner between Tracy and Borgnine is worth the price of admission.

454037,"28. HENRY: portrait of a serial killer (horror-thriller, 1992) Henry (Michael Rooker) lives with his ex-prison buddy Otis whose sister Becky moves in with them. Despite his shy nature Henry and Becky are attracted to  each other. One night Otis and Henry go out with 2 prostitutes. In a fit of  rage Henry kills one of them and with Otis' help kills the other. At first  having second thoughts Otis gets a taste for killing and they set out on a  murder spree. Otis first shoots down a passing motorist. They then break  into a house and slaughter a whole family (dog and all). They record  everything on tape. Otis begins to lose control as his perverse sexual  urges lead him to rape his own sister. When Henry finds out things take a  turn for the worst.Critique: This graphic, low-budget venture was made  in 1986 but due to the material was released 6 years later. The story is  based on the confessions of serial killer Henry Lukas (who allegedly  confessed to more than 500 murders). Since the plot eschews from any  reference of real events the theme is poorly presented. Writer-director  John McNaughton concentrates more on the nature of killing and the people  that commit them. The only sure thing we know as being Henry's murderous  excuse was that his prostitute mother beat him up, and sometimes forced him  to watch her have sex with clients. Besides that the scary thing is that we  don't really get to understand his (or anyone else's) motives for killing.  As is the case with most low-budget films the use of grainy stock footage  and cheap props prove very realistic. McNaughton shows flair by the use of  hand-held cameras (particularly in the disturbing 'family slaughter') and  good use of cinematography (invoking a visionary paranoia and suspense).  The ending further distances us from the nature of evil.QUOTES:  pawnbroker: &quot;Of course it's black and white. What do you expect for 50  bucks? ****** 3-D for God's sake?&quot;",N/A

65627,"I am one of the legion of admirers who believe that this film represents the apex of both James Whale's directorial career and Universal Studios' first cycle of monster movies.  Cleverly scripted, flawlessly acted,  wittily directed, and hauntingly scored, it's a marvel of a movie on many  levels; it works as a horror film, a satire, a black comedy, a social  commentary -- even as a romantic melodrama -- depending on your individual  interpretation.It's a real pity, then, that this rich cinematic  treasure has received such a disappointing transfer to the DVD format.  After experiencing the sharply focused, pristine prints presented on  Universal's DVD releases of &quot;Frankenstein&quot; and  &quot;The  Mummy&quot;, my expectations for &quot;Bride&quot; were  enthusiastically  high.  What a letdown!  The film is grainy, with distractingly poor  contrast -- the actors appear to have microcrobes running across their  faces, like amoeba that you might observe under a microscope.  And there  were a couple of pops and jumps inherent in the source material that I  don't recall having seen on the VHS tape release of this film.The extras  are the only features that keep this  disc from being a complete fiasco.  The poster and still archive is remarkable, and the &quot;making of&quot;  featurette is informative and enjoyable.  The theatrical trailer is the one  used for the film's Realart re-release and not the Universal original.  I  strongly suspect (and hope) there will some day be a &quot;restored&quot;  edition of this movie available. Unless you just can't wait to add this  title to your DVD collection, I have to regretfully advise that until such  an improved version comes along, you spend your hard-earned pennies on an  alternate selection.",N/A

He is later double crossed by a gay psychopath (Simon Yam, who  steals the show), on a job. He is shot, beaten and left for dead....only to  regain his strength, and return to HK for revenge.

5841,"The Professional is that rarest of films: a good action flick.  Luc Besson's direction, and Natalie Portman's performance (no wonder she caught  the eye of George Lucas) are absolutely first-rate.  But the film seemed  choppy.  Characters seemed to interact in a way that seemed as if they knew  more about each other than had been portrayed in the film.However, it  makes sense, when you realize that the European version is substantially  longer (by about an hour I think).  I would have enjoyed seeing the  somewhat ambiguous relationship between Mathilda and Leon develop more.  This is a good American  version of what I am sure was a great European  film.  I understand the Hollywood mentality of keeping every film under 2  hours (unless it's directed by Kevin Costner or Steven Spielberg), but when  you release something on DVD, you should release ALL of it.Shame on  you, DVD-makin' folks.

23074,"A terrific, outstanding cast couldn't save this one.  Rule #1 in transferring musical to screen--never, EVER tamper with the numbers.  For some reason, the musical was completely retooled for the film, with half of  its best numbers dropped.  If you've never heard or seen the original  musical production, this version has nothing to do with the actual broadway  show.  Consequently, it's way inferior.  What made the musical great was  that it wasn't just about &quot;Annie,&quot; but Christmas and the Great  Depression.  There's nothing about that in here, so the movie loses all the  poignancy of the original.Rule #2--to make a successful show to screen  transfer, the numbers have to be shot in a fantasy style.  Sounds corny,  but I'm telling  you--it works (See the modern version of &quot;Pennies  From Heaven.&quot; As gritty as the storyline is, it works as a musical  precisely because the numbers are shot so unrealistically). When you shoot  a musical in a completely realistic style, no matter how good it is it will  never have the magical feel that makes musicals feel so special; the film  will just look like a regular movie with a bunch of dopes singing out of  context for no reason.  That's exactly what happens here. There's no magic  or charm in this &quot;Annie,&quot; although the cast had enough of it. Oh,  well--what a shame--this could have been better than it was.",Annie
469718,"While this movie has an R rating and supposedly is not to be seen by anyone under 18, it was made for the 14-16 year old.  The only reason it  would have an R rating is language, and that did become offensive after  about the 200th repetition of &quot;F---.&quot; The movie is flawed from  first to last, but the worst fault is the fact that there is not one  sympathetic figure among the participants, and one starts hoping the witch  will get them quickly and painfully, starting with the foul-mouthed,  egotistical girl.  When there is no one to care about, it becomes nigh  impossible to care about the movie itself.  Now, perhaps the 15-year old  will be much taken with how wonderful this all is (and how &quot;just  f---ing uncool,&quot; I am, to borrow a much repeated term from the film),  but any mature person should find this a  colossal bore. By the way, if you  lose your map, follow a stream downhill.  Anyone knows that, anyone who has  ever gone for a tramp in the woods, secondary growth at that, in this case.

I chose to watch the competition and went to look at my TV Guide to see  when the movie would show again.  About 6 months later I watched the movie  on TV and halfway through I realized that it had been a big mistake on my  part not to tape it.  After that, knowing that TV presentations cut out soe  of the movie for commercials, I went to buy the video.  I watched the darn  thing an average of 3 times a day for the next 3 weeks.  God it was  addicting.  I bought the soundtrack not so long ago and have been listening  to it while I watch the movie.  D.B Sweeney and Moira Kelly do a great job  on the screen.

512478,"&quot;Wild Wild West&quot; was this summer's biggest disappointment. It performed well below the expectations at the box-office, and rightly so. &quot;Wild Wild West&quot; is filled with uninspired and obvious gags, even  worse, it is not at all funny. This is all the more astonishing since it  stars Will Smith, Kevin Kline and the beautiful Salma Hayek. All of them  proofed to be capable comic actors in previous pictures. Director Barry  Sonnenfeld was also known as a man with a freaky sense of humor (&quot;Men  in Black&quot; and &quot;Adams Family&quot; weren't great films, but at  least succeeded in entertaining the audience).Unfortunately, they don't  score big this time. The special effects are good, but the whole films  appears overproduced and the actors seem to wear signs around the necks  which say what is funny about them.&quot;Wild Wild West&quot; is an  example for soulless, uninspired fimmaking (as was &quot;ID4&quot;,  &quot;Godzilla&quot; and &quot;Armageddon&quot;). Let's hope that the  failure of that film does finally ring a bell among the studio-executives  and also the directors.

272996,"In the tense, edge-of-the-seat tradition of Fail Safe, By Dawn's Early Light is a vivid depiction of how the hair-trigger reactions of the superpowers can be manipulated by persons outside ordinary power circles,  and how the technology and pre-ordained response patterns take on an  inexorable life of their own.As a retired military man, I found that  this film grew more frightening as the initial nuclear exchange faded into  the background and both the civilian and military leadership struggled with  the apocalyptic question of how or even whether to turn off the brutal  cycle of escalating retaliation.  The technical accuracy of the film, both  in the equipment and the tactics displayed, heightened the  effectiveness.What makes this movie stand out from other doomsday  thrillers is its ability to show the terrible strain of responsibility and  indecision on people at all levels of the command structure, and the  personal price paid by those who could handle the pressure and those who  could not.  One particularly harrowing and very plausible scenario shows  two Navy fighters in the process of preparing to shoot down an Air Force  bomber that has been judged to have &quot;turned&quot;, both figuratively  and literally.There are many superb dramatic performances in this film.  Foremost among them are Martin Landau as a desperate and badly injured  President, Darren McGavin as the Secretary of the Interior, suddenly thrust  into a position of leadership for which he is unprepared, and James Earl  Jones as an Air Force General commanding the Looking Glass command center  aircraft.Powers Boothe is excellent as a hot-shot pilot who finds  himself slowly beginning to question his black and white view of the nature  of warfare and his place in the overall picture.  Rebecca DeMornay shows  that, when she isn't given the makeup and fancy costumes to rely on, she  has considerable acting talent to fall back on.This is a nerve-wracking,  very credible journey on the tightrope of nuclear devastation, tautly  directed and masterfully paced, from its suspenseful beginning to its  thought-provoking end.  By Dawn's Early Light remains an effective thriller  even after the end of the cold war.  Highly recommended.",N/A

Whether it's intentional or not is another  question.What I mean is, when John Connor is conceived, Sarah is being  impregnated by someone who hasn't been born yet. Technically, he doesn't  really exist. So in a way, Sarah is like the Virgin Mary. Is it a  coincidence that John Connor, the one who will save mankind, has the same  initials of a messiah people worship already?Armageddon is, of course, a  biblical theme. After it comes, John Connor will lead his followers in a  battle against Skynet, which could really be interpreted as the Antichrist.

132323,"Tour Hawaii with Elvis Presley!!!  That's a pretty good description of this musical, the success of which marked the end of the singer's attempts  at being a serious actor.  For what it is--a travelogue with music and a  slight plot--it isn't bad at all.  But &quot;King Creole,&quot;  &quot;Flaming Star,&quot; and even &quot;Follow That Dream&quot;  demonstrated that Elvis could indeed act when given half the chance.  That's all &quot;Blue Hawaii&quot; is, though:  half a chance.  The songs  aren't exactly rock and roll, but most provide pleasant listening, and, of  course, this is the movie that introduced the lovely &quot;Can't Help  Falling in Love,&quot; the song with which he would end all of his concerts  in the 70s.  Angela Lansbury is on hand as Elvis' mother, even though she  was only a few years older than him (just as she was only a few years older  than Laurence Harvey when she played his mother in &quot;The Manchurian  Candidate&quot; the next year, a movie in which Elvis might just as well  have been cast considering his apparent manipulation at the hands of  Colonel Parker), and, of course, there are plenty of luscious babes about  for those who don't consider Angela a turn on.  &quot;Blue Hawaii&quot; is  a real mixed bag.  It is, perhaps, the very definition of  &quot;fluff,&quot; and as fluff it is attractive, but it would ultimately  lead to dozens of execrable imitations that would make Presley's movie  career one of the most lamentable in history.

Jackson is great as the hostage negotiator who is forced to  take hostages himself when he is framed for murder.  When Spacey is brought  into the fold to talk Jackson down, it becomes a great war of words and  wit.  Both men have their own agendas, and as actors they have incredible  chemistry.  The action sequences are good too, and don't weigh down the  plot of the story.  The supporting cast is great too, and help to add humor  to the tense situation at hand.

286331,"An over-the-top opinion? To most, probably, but I have never been in any doubt. Vincent Price, my favourite actor since I saw &quot;Fall Of The House Of Usher&quot; in 1975, has never really been taken seriously,  because he so often played tongue-in-cheek, yet surely an actor should be  judged by the degree of enjoyment they give you. Certainly his range was  greater than most give him credit for, and he could play it straight, as in  &quot;Laura&quot;, &quot;Witchfinder General&quot; and &quot;The Whales Of  August&quot; for example. &quot;Theatre Of Blood&quot; gave Price the  chance to turn his &quot;hammy&quot; type performance into an art form.  This is EXCELLENT acting by someone clearly in peak form and relishing  every moment and opportunity, and there are plenty to be had. Surrounding  Mr. P. were an assortment of top British character actors. Its well  documented that they were all reluctant to appear and only agreed aslong as  each of the others did, but clearly they too got fully into the morbid yet  hilarious spirit of the proceedings. Vincent Price plays a disillusioned  actor, content to restrict himself to Shakespearian roles but panned by the  critics as a result. When they, not surprisingly, overlook him for an  award, he decides enough is enough, and after a failed suicide bid, goes  totally loopy and commences dispatching these tormentors of his soul at a  rate of knots. The original aspect here is that he kills them in a method  extracted directly from Shakespeare (unless it doesnt quite fit his plans  in which case he merely re-writes the scene!). The opportunity given to  Price to recite passages from these plays is what gives this film its edge,  he does it in such an overboard yet brilliant and memorable fashion that  you WANT him to succeed. Where real-life critics have their only problem,  is that the death scenes are graphically depicted with a surplus of  blood-letting in four of them. Yet it is only the first which is truly  shocking (as Michael Hordern is stabbed to death in the style of Julius  Caesar by a large group of &quot;squatters&quot;) because as soon as Price  leans over the dying man and utters &quot;I am well, it is you who are  dead!&quot; you realise this film is not to be taken TOO seriously and  rapidly get into the gleefully gruesome spirit of the thing. That he will  not get away with it is not a totally forgone conclusion, (I mean hed  escaped justice the year before in &quot;Dr. Phibes&quot;), but  his demise  in a flame-engulfed theatre is definately the ONLY diappointment in the  entire movie (with such originality throughout, fancy killing him by the  same method as in virtually all his Corman-Poe productions!).
